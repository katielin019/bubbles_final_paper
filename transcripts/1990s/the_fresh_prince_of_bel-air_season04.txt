{START OF EPISODE 1}
Philip, did you get too close?
I don't know, Vivian, is four feet too close?
Nicky, honey, Daddy won't hurt you.
What is about me that baby doesn't like?
Is it my beard?
Because if it is, I'll shave it off right now.
Don't you dare.
I love the way that beard feels.
I'm surprised you remember.
Sweetheart, it hasn't been that long since we've made love, has it?
Five months this Tuesday.
Thin walls.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'll make it better, I promise.
I hope so.
There are priests laughing at me.
I'll have my breakfast in the family room, Geoffrey.
I'll get the wheelbarrow, sir.
- Morning, Master William.
- Hey.
Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil out there grumbling something about getting his tubes tied.
He's bluffing.
D.J. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Nick in the house.
Get up.
Oh, man.
Aunt Viv, this kid is sprouting.
Hey, you know, another month, he'll be bigger than Carlton.
I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
Seems like just yesterday when I was wiping the tears from his eyes.
No, no, that was yesterday.
I told you that boy wasn't ready for Jurassic Park yet.
Will, honey, you and Carlton will look out for each other, won't you?
Come on, absolutely, Aunt Viv.
We got each other's back.
Great, great, great.
You two just be careful.
There are a lot of sick, demented perverts out there.
Greetings, all.
Hello, Jazz.
I brought a gift for baby Dicky.
- Nicky.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Whatever.
I know it's five months late, but I wanted to find just the right thing.
This is very sweet of you, Jazz.
Thank you.
You know, Ms. Banks, since you had that baby there's something different about you.
Here, Will.
Thank you, Jazz, very much.
- It's a baby pillow.
Isn't it beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.
Jazz, this thing says "Wendy Beth" on it.
So?
When you buy a wallet, doesn't it have someone else's picture in it first?
Jazz, you stole this pillow.
It's the thought that counts.
- Hi, Daddy.
Bye, Daddy.
- Whoa, precious.
Where you going?
- To the mall.
See you.
- Hold it.
Sweetheart, come here.
Today is Saturday, baby.
Why don't you and I do something together.
Like what?
Like, we could go to the mall.
Daddy, all my friends are at the mall.
Do you know what would happen if I showed up with my father?
What?
Be banned for life from The Gap?
No, Mom.
No, school don't start for another week.
Oh, yeah, the apartment is great.
Yes, it's in a safe neighborhood, Ma.
Oh, check it out.
The candy store actually sells candy.
Yeah, Mom, I know how proud you are of me that I'm going to college.
Come on, don't do this, Mom.
You know how this affects me.
Well, yeah, it's like a dream come true for both of us.
I love you too, Mommy.
Bye-bye.
Kendrick Petroleum up three and an eighth.
What did I tell you?
You called it, son.
Vectrocomp Industries down third day in a row.
- The merger killed them.
- Yeah.
Good thing we got out when we did, huh?
I'm gonna miss you, son.
Did you say something, Dad?
I don't want you to move out.
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.
He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.
Excuse me.
Is this what you've been telling my boy?
- What?
- That life is one big orgy.
- I never said - College is hard work, son.
Followed by a family, which is even more hard work.
And a teenage daughter who doesn't wanna be seen with you in public.
And a wife who won't let you anywhere near her.
And a butler who may be the father of your child.
- And a gardener, a gardener - Dad!
Dad!
Hey, Will.
Will, I can't bear to see him like this.
That's why we moving, so we don't have to.
Well, look at him.
He needs me.
No, I don't.
I don't need either one of you.
There is a silver lining in my dark cloud.
Hilary.
I'm sorry, Hilary Banks?
You know, fate works in mysterious ways.
For years, I've been trying to get her to move out of the house and now when I'm gonna be alone, she is my salvation.
So you two, you two go on with your little lives.
My Hilary needs me.
Okay, everybody, guess what.
Okay, I can see you're stumped.
I'm getting married.
To Trevor.
Oh, Hilary.
What is this?
Hilary's marrying Trevor.
Oh, come on.
Don't tease me.
- Mother, it's true.
- When did he propose?
This morning, as he was leaving the pool house.
I mean, this morning on the phone.
You certainly ain't wasting no time getting a gown.
Mom and Dad bought this for me when I hit puberty.
One down, three to go.
Oh, Philip, you all right?
You look like you're in shock.
Shock?
Oh, no, it figures.
Here's the best part.
I asked Trevor to officially propose to me during his Slice of L.A. segment on tomorrow's news.
That way, all of Los Angeles can share in our happiness.
Hilary, sweetheart I think there may be a question that you should ask yourself.
I already did.
I'm going to register at Tiffany's.
No, no, sweetheart.
Are you in love with Trevor?
What's love got to do with it?
I'm having a wedding.
Hey, back off, lke.
We're having a wedding.
- Let's go do the invitation list.
- Oh, Mommy.
Way to go, sis.
The guy's a prince.
I can't believe she's gonna marry that jerk.
Trevor's not a jerk.
He's a superficial, self-centered, TelePrompTer-reading airhead.
Sounds like a match to me.
My little girl is leaving me.
Are you gonna be all right, big guy?
Because I can stay here and help you through this rocky time.
I'll be fine.
We out then.
- Bye, Dad.
- You take care, man.
So if you take package D, you get basic cable three premiums and the Lust Channel.
Carlton, how you feel about the Lust Channel?
I think it's 24 hours of shallow, pointless nudity.
You heard the bird.
We'll take it.
You'll be hooked up tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
You heard that right.
Mr. Smith.
This boy's getting some respect around here.
Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
Word?
I didn't know RuPaul lived in L.A. See, one of my duties as mascot is to walk around and greet people on campus.
So I'm doing my thing, and this wise guy starts messing with my plumage.
Then she came to my rescue.
Five feet, 11 inches of feminine firepower.
I bet she could toss me around this room.
Hope it works out for you, buddy.
- Oh, Will, she's crazy about me.
- What makes you think that?
Get this, she said she's looking forward to seeing me again.
- So?
- So no one's ever said that to me except my dentist.
You were right.
We're on our own three hours and my life's already taken a turn for the better.
Well, let freedom ring.
Oh, that's the door.
Hey, Mr. Gorodetsky.
I thought I said no pets.
I'm not really a peacock.
And I'm not really a slumlord.
Look, if you need to reach me, I'll be at my home number.
- You don't live here?
- Are you kidding?
Oh, yeah.
I hope that's not a long-distance call you're making.
Can I see that first dollar you ever had again?
- Oh, sure.
- Put it away, you cheapskate.
I'm just calling Jazz, invite a couple of people over.
Christen the new crib.
Is there anyone in particular you'd like to invite?
I don't keep friends.
In time of war, they can be tortured and give up valuable secrets about you.
I was talking about your Miss Lady Peacock.
Are you nuts?
I'm not bringing her within a hundred yards of you.
What?
Carlton, I'm your cousin, man.
The cousin who stole every woman I ever had.
Oh, please, I stole one girl.
My point exactly.
All right, Carlton, I promise you I ain't gonna press up on her.
As far as I'm concerned, she's just a man with breasts.
She does have breasts, doesn't she?
Well, all right.
She runs the campus store.
I'll go ask her.
- Carlton.
- What?
Change your clothes.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, look.
It's Carlton's first haircut.
Hilary's first day at kindergarten.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey.
Here's Ashley on a diving board.
The way we were.
You've got to look to the future, sir.
Put the past behind you.
I guess.
You're right.
- What's for dinner?
- Leftovers.
Hold it, hold it.
- Who do we have here?
- We met at the mall.
What's your name, son?
This.
This is a stick with a snake wrapped around it.
- It's a symbol, like Prince.
- Prince who?
See, that's exactly why fathers ain't allowed at the mall.
What's this thing?
It's a symbol for "get out of my house"!
Daddy, I love him!
Keep it up, sir and I'll be all you have left.
You owe me.
That's Boardwalk with a hotel.
That's 2 grand.
Thank you.
- Community Chest.
- Yes, and what a lovely community it is.
Coming through, coming through.
Hey, Carl, where you been, man?
I was watching the sun set over the Bank of America building.
I think you know everybody Oh, except LaTanya.
Hello.
I'd like to set the record straight before any other woman comes on to me.
I'm in a monogamous relationship.
- Really?
How long?
- It's going on five hours.
I'd appreciate it if you scavengers would refrain from eating this.
I'm saving it for my Jacqueline.
Jacqueline is his imaginary friend.
Hey.
Hey, my brother, can I help you?
Yeah, man, this is where the party at?
What party, man?
The party we paid $25 apiece to go to.
Say, where's En Vogue?
Hey, my brother, I think you got the wrong crib, man.
This is apartment 206, right?
Well, yeah, man, but it ain't no party.
Read it and weep, man.
"It's the rump-baking, booty-shaking don't miss the mix in apartment 206".
- This is Jazz's handwriting.
- How do you know?
All the letters is cut out of magazines.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up with you, man?
Hey, my brother.
This is a private party, and y'all are going to have to step.
Not without my $25.
Get out or I'll call security.
Not old dude with the flashlight.
He carries a whistle too.
All right, man, we don't want that kind of trouble.
Guess we'll just go home and watch some TV.
Sounds like a good idea, my brother.
Hey.
Hey.
Why don't you just take the pictures off the wall while you're at it.
Good idea.
Go nice with my new TV.
Look, Carlton, if anybody else comes, you take care of it.
I'm going to get our stuff back.
Hey, y'all come back here with our stuff, man.
This should cover your $25.
Oh, the blender's still on warranty.
It looks like your Jacqueline stood you up.
It also looked like Loni and Burt had a good marriage.
Dance with me, you freak.
Maybe if you asked me nicely.
This party's played out.
Oh, tell Will the crib is dope.
Like that's all I got on my mind.
Come on, Jacqueline.
My bedtime's coming soon.
Bird man?
Jacqueline.
Wait, I thought there were gonna be other people here.
Well, there were.
They left.
Some with lovely parting gifts.
Maybe I better leave too.
No, don't.
I went and got us some dinner from Chez Paul.
Filet mignon?
Thanks, but I don't eat red meat.
I'll give it up too.
No need, bird man.
Jacqueline, how about a dance before you go to christen the new crib.
It'd be my first dance with a brother from Bel-Air.
Better take the opportunity.
There aren't too many of us.
All right.
What is this anyway?
Bobby Vinton, the Polish Prince.
Well, I have some Manilow if you prefer.
No, the Polish Prince will do just fine.
It's my Jacqueline.
It's the TV.
Jackie?
Oh, my God.
Will.
No, no, no!
Go, peacock.
Go, peacock.
Go, peacock.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.
He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
Okay, everybody, guess what.
I'm getting married.
Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
Oh, my God.
Will.
No, no, no!
- Baby!
- Oh, man.
Girl, look at you.
That's for not calling me after you left.
Well, I called you twice times.
The line was busy.
Will, you have not changed, have you?
Carlton, I'll see you later.
Since I didn't buy a program on the way in could you please tell me what the heck is going on?
Man, look, that filly is from Philly.
We grew up together.
What does that mean, "grew up together"?
What do you want it to mean?
That she hates you and you have no interest in her.
You saw her smack me, didn't you?
I've seen a lot of girls smack you, Will.
Then I see the same girls leaving your room.
Yeah, well, Jackie is not like most girls.
She's special.
Look at her.
Yo, man, she used to be able to beat every brother on the playground in a foot race.
I'll fight you for her, Will.
Any time, any place.
Relax.
I got about as much chance with Jackie as you do.
Hey, Carlton.
Did Mr. Gorodetsky say anything about this building being a landmark or something?
No, why?
Because there's a tour bus pulling up on the front lawn.
All right, y'all, everybody in rows one through 15 the party's in apartment 206.
- Jazz!
- Jazz!
Everybody in rows 16 through 30.
And have money in your hands.
Senior citizens get a 10-percent discount.
I do take tips.
So, Will what's on tap for tomorrow?
Daddy, how about a November wedding?
Nothing extravagant, just 800 of our closest friends and relatives.
Or maybe we could book the Forum.
I'm sure the Lakers will be on the road by then.
Daddy, is something wrong?
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It's This wedding took me by surprise.
I didn't count on losing you and Carlton on the same day.
Oh, Daddy.
You're not losing me.
You promise?
Look, even though I'm getting married you'll always be my daddy.
And you'll always be my little girl.
I'm also Trevor's little girl.
No, no, no.
Technically, you're his woman, not his little girl.
Then why does he make me wear those outfits?
Excuse me.
I'm scheduled for a heart attack.
Go away.
Ain't no party.
Open up, it's Mr. Gorodetsky.
Just a second, I'm undressed.
- Carlton, Carlton, wake up.
- Look out, Jerry.
Tom's gonna get you.
Wake up, it's the landlord.
We gotta put the furniture back.
Come on.
Open up!
Open up here!
This used to be my lawn.
And this used to be my banister.
- And you used to be my tenants.
- But But I want you out of here by noon.
- But - Noon!
He kicked your butt.
Excuse me, that's our butts, Carlton.
We're in this together.
Not anymore, Kemosabe.
I'm going back to my family, where I belong.
- No, you are not.
- Oh, yeah?
Why?
Because that will be like admitting we can't make it on our own.
I don't have to make it on my own.
I'm rich.
I never wanted to move out in the first place.
Thanks to you, I've had my heart broken and I've been evicted.
If this is your idea of independence, you can have it.
I can be reached by fax.
Carlton.
Carlton, come on, man.
I can't make rent without you.
Then come home, Will.
I'll send Geoffrey for my things.
Then go ahead home, you damn baby.
You'll probably be there till you're in your 30s anyway.
Like all those other serial killers.
This is Jazz's mother.
He's not here.
This is Publishers Clearinghouse.
You've already won.
It's about time.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Will, I'm so glad it's you.
I heard somebody disguised as me ran a party scam.
Jazz, you got me kicked out my crib, man.
Let me make it up to you.
Talk fast, you've only got a few minutes to live.
- You can stay here with me.
- In this roach motel?
It would only be temporary.
I'm getting thrown out on the 15th.
Jazz give me the money.
Money?
What money?
The 25 dollars a head you charged for my party.
Man, I was sneaking the bus back to the depot and I got held up.
White dude.
He took the bus too.
The money's gone, isn't it?
Like the Jheri curl.
Here you go, roomie.
Get comfy.
You're gonna love it here.
That's the Wilsons.
You'll get to know them.
I hate you, Jazz.
I know you don't mean that.
"Roommate wanted.
Minutes from school.
Must love ice hockey, country-and-western music and Tom Cruise movies".
This is worse than Jazz's.
Whoa, wait, back up, girl.
Wax on, wax off.
I'm sorry I had to clock you last night, but you know me and my temper.
No, you know, I understand.
That torch you've been carrying for me all these years suddenly got a little too hot to handle.
We were friends, Will.
Nothing more.
We were more than friends that night after Alonzo Simmons' party.
I was young and immature then.
I guess you still are, Lobe.
Hey, hey, hey, don't you be calling me Lobe.
I left that in Philly, where I thought I left you.
What are you doing out here anyway?
Remember that jump shot you taught me?
Well, I parlayed that into a basketball scholarship.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
You mean they're giving basketball scholarships to girls now?
Lmagine my surprise.
There I was just churning butter, and the phone rings.
So you and Carlton tight?
He is.
We're cousins.
I've been staying with his family.
- In Bel-Air?
- Yeah, so?
- So beware of the bougieman.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I kept in touch with everybody from the hood.
Everybody but me.
Why?
Why?
Yeah.
Why would you keep in touch with everybody but me?
I see this really bothers you.
I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes.
Damn you, Will.
Just answer the question.
Why didn't you call me?
Because I missed you too much.
How's that?
I said it.
Happy?
That what you wanna hear?
Hey, y'all, I missed the hell out of her.
I missed her.
I missed her.
I said it.
That's what you wanted, right?
Everybody know I missed her.
Look, I gotta get up out of here.
Gotta go find me an apartment and a job.
Don't hit your head on the rim.
One of my people quit this morning.
I'm sorry.
Are you suggesting maybe you and me working together side by side?
No, it's too tempting.
Before long, you'd be dragging me down into the storeroom and snatching all my gear off and everything.
Then I have to nail you with a sexual-harassment suit like the Anita Hill thing in reverse.
It's too much now.
Look, maybe your transmission's stuck in junior high or something but mine's not.
I busted my butt to get where I am, and I'm not about to lose focus just because you're back in my life.
Now, I got me an agenda too.
And it certainly does not include risking frostbite around you.
- Fine.
- Well, good then.
When do I start?
Next week, when school starts.
I will be here.
Oh, Will.
Wear something warm.
Yo, man, I didn't really miss her.
That was just game I was kicking there.
You know, that's how you gotta do it.
Hey, man.
Hey, man.
I was, man I was I was coming Coming back I was getting the rest of my stuff.
Well, why don't you take some food too.
We have plenty.
Well, if it's gonna spoil.
So things aren't going quite as smoothly as you planned, are they, son?
Hey, hold up.
Not only do I got me a new place to stay I got me a job on campus.
Adversity is my oyster.
This will go good with my adversity.
Why don't you come home, Will?
No, I can't, Uncle Phil, man.
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate you taking me in and everything but I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I need to have my own space.
Trevor's about to propose.
Where's Carlton?
The last I saw him, he was in his room kissing the floor.
Will, I just want you to know that the door is always open for you.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Turn it up.
Oh, there's Trevor.
It's a bungee jump.
I asked him to propose in a special way, but I never expected a bungee jump.
What's a bungee jump?
Well, Hil, he's gonna propose while falling 300 feet on a giant rubber band.
Isn't it romantic?
Please, whatever happened to getting down on one knee?
- Daddy, that's for old fogies.
- I got down on one knee.
Sustained.
Look, there he goes.
Hilary Banks Yes, Trevor?
Will you marry me?
I ain't no bungee expert or nothing but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that.
"Please stand by"?
Great.
The president's about to interrupt my marriage proposal.
Let's just pray that Trevor's okay.
Well, that was a lovely service.
Trevor didn't look so bad for a dude that had a concrete face-lift.
Fool.
Like that was his real head.
Could you two show a little compassion?
Your sister's right behind you.
I still can't understand.
Sweetheart, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
No, I mean technically.
Am I a widow or what?
This is all my fault.
If I hadn't asked for a special proposal Trevor would be in my arms instead of in my purse.
I love you, Trevor.
Hilary Trevor wasn't cremated.
Then who's this?
I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.
Sweetheart Now is the time when you should make use of Reverend Boyd.
Is he single?
I mean you should be spiritual.
After all, Trevor's in heaven now.
Right.
He's up there with my little dog Scruffy.
Yeah, and the bus he rode in under.
Must everything be a joke to you?
My sister's in a fragile condition.
I'm trying to help her bounce back.
Bounce.
Trevor bounced.
Son, go get yourself a milk.
If you go right back to work as soon as possible maybe it would help you get your mind off things.
Work?
Every inch of that newsroom reminds me of Trevor.
His desk, his makeup bib the shower in his office.
I just need some time to find some sense of inner peace.
After all I am alone now.
Oh, no, sweetheart.
You have me.
Look, in a few days why don't I take you to the mall and we can go shopping.
Go to the mall with my father?
Sorry, I forgot.
Must you do that?
I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but Greetings, mourners.
Hilary.
If there's anything we can learn from this tragedy that's to live each day to the fullest.
I know, Jazz.
So with that in mind, what are you doing later?
Oh, my - It's all right.
- Guess y'all need to be alone right now.
Yeah, so do you, Jazz.
I'll meet you back at the palace later.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
There's a hostage situation back at my building.
SWAT team said it'd be a week before we could get back in.
Jazz Forgive me for what I'm about to do.
Hilary, can I have a word with you?
Look, you know, I think you got the right idea not going back to, you know, work so soon.
You're just lucky that there's nothing around here that reminds you of Trevor.
Of course, there is the pool house.
Never mind, forget about that, though.
Then, on the other hand that is where you and he shared countless romantic evenings.
I bet if those walls could talk they'd whisper: "Trevor".
"Trevor".
Daddy, I can't stay in the pool house.
I'm moving back in here.
Of course, sweetheart, whatever will make you more comfortable.
I don't know what I would do without my family.
Mother.
Ashley.
Can you get my things from the pool house?
Of course.
Come on, Ashley.
- Say, Uncle Phil, man.
- Hey, you know what, Will?
I was thinking maybe I could turn that pool house into a law library.
- Stop playing, listen.
- No, no, well A greenhouse.
That would work, huh?
I said, stop playing, listen.
- I was wondering - You can have the pool house.
- All right.
- At the same rent Hilary was paying.
- And I have a few rules.
- That's cool, because I got demands.
- No loud music after 11.
- Twelve.
- Eleven-thirty.
- Cool.
Check it out.
It's important that I have my privacy.
Say a honey be tiptoeing up my crib.
That's my business, not yours.
- Fine.
No skinny-dipping.
- You gotta promise me that same thing.
Done.
Well, son, I guess you got yourself a pool house.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
How come he gets the pool house and I'm stuck upstairs with the grieving widow?
Another thing.
Keep this person off my property or I'll shoot him.
It's my property.
I'm gonna inherit it after the big guy takes his bungee jump.
Right, big guy?
Well, he does have a point.
I'll tell you what, why don't you two work it out.
Okay, tallest one gets the bedroom.
I need the big closet for my peacock suit.
So nice to have my family back.
- You shut up, man.
- Look, you shut up.
And wipe that damn milk mustache off.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Will!
So glad it's you.
I heard someone disguised as me just ran a party scam.
I'm sorry, what?
How many people think we doing that again?
Some Somebody started Party scam.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Look, Will, we're almost there.
Carlton, relax.
This is the line for class registration not the Nixon Library.
Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a few courses you might be interested in.
Thank you, Carlton, but I already have my academic priorities in order.
Will, I'm proud of you.
You're finally taking your education seriously.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'll have what she's having.
Will, do you realize we stopped and talked to every woman we saw?
So?
We were on the freeway.
Why do you do these crazy things?
The same reason Eddie Murphy tries to sing, I like the challenge.
Right, well, if you like to be challenged so much how come you registered for classes like Cheese Appreciation?
Carlton, the challenge is to make your life as easy as possible.
That's why God made canned meat.
- Spam cakes, anyone?
- Hey, man.
- Morning.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
Geoffrey, something sure smells good.
Patchouli, sweet of you to notice.
So how was registration today, guys?
Oh, yo, it was slamming, Uncle Phil.
- He met a girl, right?
- You got it, big guy.
And he joined classes just because she's in it.
- He doesn't even know what he's taking.
- I do too.
Name it.
Western Pornography.
Western Philosophy.
Western Philosophy?
I'm impressed.
You don't even know what Western Philosophy is.
I do too.
It answers questions like: Did anybody really believe Kool Moe Dee was a cowboy?
The wild wild west The wild wild west I used to live downtown - Ashley.
- I'm late for school, Daddy.
Ashley!
Could we see a little compassion here?
Hilary just lost her fiancé.
She could use a little sisterly comfort.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
Hilary, this is your sister, Ashley.
Suck it up, and get on with your life!
Hilary.
Sweetheart.
How you feeling?
I'm feeling much better, thanks.
Now, now, baby, tell you what.
Why don't you put on some clothes and hop in the car, and drive over to Neiman's and do a little shopping.
Oh, thanks, Daddy, but I'm not ready to go out just yet.
And you don't have to.
Here.
- I'll even look the number up for you.
- Hello, Neiman's?
Listen, I want to order that adorable Donna Karan pantsuit in your catalog.
Item DK35712.
Yeah, and on page 14, there's this fabulous leather bag and Oh, that would be cute.
Okay, okay, attention Kmart shoppers.
We're running out of books for Psych 157 the study of human sexuality.
So for any of you slimmies who miss out I'll be more than happy to demonstrate the contents of the book.
Twice, you know.
- Can I borrow that for a second?
- Oh, sure thing, boss lady.
You're an idiot.
There you go making snap judgments again.
- Hi, I need to get - Hey, Sting, kick some lyrics, man.
Do you always have to embarrass me in public?
No, you do that all by yourself.
What'd you sign up for today, Advanced Sarcasm?
Whatever I'm taking has gotta be tougher than your schedule.
What is Cheese Appreciation, anyway?
Have you ever heard of a little thing called Western Philosophy?
You're taking Western Philosophy?
I can see you're being seduced by my intellectual prowess.
Is that Spam in your teeth?
I didn't have no Spam.
Carlton, my bird.
Excuse me, you think I could possibly get some help?
Well, Hair Club For Men would be a good start.
Nothing like that minimum-wage humor.
Look, my friend, if it's not too taxing I'd like you to do a little work, find these books for me.
All right, all right, just relax a second.
Here, fill out this requisition form, and I'll get them for you as soon as I can.
Okay, try to have it before graduation, okay?
Sure thing, Skippy.
You know, I'd stay and continue this battle of wits with you but you're obviously unarmed.
Hey, I'll be sure and take care of this requisition form for you.
He dribbles behind his back he's up and he shoots.
Oh, and it's no good.
Carlton the peacock says, "Don't be a quitter, pick up your litter".
Help me!
Come on, guys, help me up.
Yeah, we need a cleanup on aisle four.
We got some bird droppings.
Excuse me but I think I've seen your picture somewhere before.
Oh, yeah, that's right, it was in the dictionary next to: You have nothing better to do than hit on me?
Well, now, I don't know, let me check my schedule.
Nope, all clear.
And Plus, I don't have any early classes, that means we could sleep in.
You're relentless.
Yeah, I don't give up, neither.
Just think of me as the Love Terminator.
T2, meet my boyfriend, T-Rex.
Hasta la vista, baby.
Hey, Skippy, the Garth Brooks concert must be over, huh?
- You think I could get by?
- Well, not with those looks.
I see you're hung up on superficial facades.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't speak geek.
No, now, come on, come on, man.
I'm just kidding.
Take a seat right here, next to me and observe a class clown in his natural habitat.
I get it.
You're planning on giving the teacher a real hard time, is that it?
Well, you know, that's plan B. Plan A was derailed by this refrigerator-shaped gentleman over here.
I gotta tell you, I see a real problem with Plan B. What's that?
Watch.
I am Professor Jeremy Mansfield and this is Western Philosophy.
I'm Will Smith.
And this is an interesting coincidence.
Philosophy is all about the perception of reality.
And today's reality is this is a very difficult course.
I am a very difficult man and I'm going to make your lives very difficult.
Excuse me, Professor Mansfield, it's not too late to start sucking up, is it?
There'll be a paper every week and a pop quiz whenever I feel like having some fun and I'm a fun-loving guy.
You will have five 20-page papers, two midterms and a little cumulative final that I like to call the widow-maker.
Thank you, Padre.
Not so quick with the hair jokes now, my friend?
Well, work may be hard but I think in the long run you'll find this course electrifying.
No, no, no!
No, wait.
Call my mother!
Somebody call the governor!
I ain't even supposed to be in this class, man!
I wanna live.
So, what I'm trying to do here, Mr. Hosek, is just drop this one class.
Okay, according to your schedule, I would say it's Western Philosophy.
Yeah, how'd you know that?
It's the only course you're taking that actually requires staying awake.
Wait a minute, I have a really good reason for wanting to drop that class.
Yeah, and I'm sure my wife has a really good reason for cheating on me.
Look, man, I got problems of my own.
You think you got problems?
My wife has seen more action than Chuck Norris.
I got an office that used to be the janitor's washroom.
Look, here!
I got a toilet in my closet!
And every day I just see my career going down it!
Now, since registration is over, officially over, the only way to get out of a class is to get the instructor's written permission.
Here.
But I have to get Professor Mansfield's signature?
He's not gonna sign this.
There has to be another way.
Well, actually, there There is.
Well, come on, man, tell me, tell me.
Make it one of your demands when you climb the bell tower with a rifle.
Nurse, I'm ready to leave now.
- Hi, Dad, how was court today?
- It was great.
I got to send El Diablo up the river.
El Diablo, the graffiti guy?
He was the worst tagger the city's ever known.
It'll be a while before they see his name around here again.
Vivian.
It's celery, I swear.
Philip, what has gotten into you?
The incarceration of a felon always gets my juices pumping.
Let's go upstairs and celebrate.
Honey, we have a problem.
- Hilary, your credit cards, I mean - After, after.
See?
So what?
We're wealthy.
You should have seen me deny that man's plea bargain.
I was brilliant!
You're going upstairs aren't you?
Yes, sweetheart.
Is there a problem?
I have no one in my life to go upstairs with anymore.
Lower.
Honey, how about a rain check?
Rain check?
Vivian, I am not a car wash.
I have needs.
So does Hilary.
Honey, I'm sorry, I will stay down here with you.
Vivian!
I'm ready for my wax job.
Mr. Smith.
Such a quiet entrance.
Where's your Your vim your verve your pedestrian wit?
Why don't we stop wasting each other's time.
Just give me an F and I'll be on my way.
Will that make you happy?
What would make me happy is never having been here in the first place.
Just get me a drop slip.
I'll make your wish a reality.
You mean all I have to do to get out of this class is ask?
I don't want anybody in here who doesn't wanna be here.
Man, you gonna start a stampede.
You know, I take back everything I said about you.
And give me a couple of hours before you start your car.
Psych.
Or should I say "philosp".
One of the central questions of philosophy is the revelation of truth.
Enjoy.
Do you wanna know the truth?
Do you wanna know the truth?
You can't handle the truth!
Hey, that's Jack Nicholson.
Mr. Smith, if you wouldn't mind, please would you just beam yourself out of here.
- Captain Kirk, now that's fly.
- No, this is The Fly: "Help me!
Help me"!
Reality is, reality changes constantly.
Yesterday's reality may not necessarily be today's.
Everybody got a pencil?
Okay, good.
Hold it up.
Little higher.
Little lower.
Perfect, right there.
Now break it in half.
What a sound.
From now on, we're going to be using our minds.
Hey, hey, give me a pencil.
Give me a pencil.
This course isn't about taking notes.
This course is about creative thinking.
All right, look, conservatives, right?
Liberals, rappers, skinheads nudists and televangelists, they all have something in common.
- You know what it is?
- They all been on Montel Williams.
See, I can't hear you because you no longer exist.
But you could shove me, though, right?
What they have in common is they all have a distinct version of the truth.
But do we really care what the truth is?
No, not really.
We want to know, "How come nobody loves me"?
"Where's my next paycheck coming from"?
"How come I never get any breaks in life"?
Okay, let's get on our feet.
We need a couple of volunteers to start with.
Let's get some people who have a personal philosophy that is rooted in, oh, I don't know, sex.
Okay, that's what I thought.
Nothing kinky, we just need two.
Denise, right?
Denise and Evan.
Good.
All right, right up there.
Now, don't be nervous.
You're gonna engage in a little dialectic.
Dialectic is a ten-dollar word, and it means "debate".
Man!
I should have never dropped out of his class.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
- What you doing down here?
- I'm gonna tape Carlton's first pep rally.
You have no idea how proud I am that he's the peacock.
Nope, not even a clue.
You got a little time, though.
You want some grub?
- I've already eaten.
- Is that a yes or a no?
Man, this brings back memories.
I bet you was in the top of your class at Princeton, huh?
Actually, far from it.
I was spinning my wheels until I met Matthew Langford.
- Who's that, one of your professors?
- Not "one".
The professor.
Man changed my life.
Turned a skinny kid from South Carolina into the man you see today.
And you know how?
He challenged me.
To what?
A pie-eating contest?
No, to having a fool as a nephew.
I have this theory.
I believe that everyone in college has one special teacher that That gives him an insight, a glimpse into who they really are.
You be on the lookout, Will.
I think I found that dude already, Uncle Phil.
Already?
I was in my third year before I found Professor Langford.
Let me tell you, this dude is hilarious.
I mean, he's fun, he's funny.
He makes me think about stuff in a way that I never even looked at it before.
And I dropped his class.
Let me guess.
Western Philosophy, right?
How does everybody know that?
Because every time you're faced with a challenge, you run for cover.
Come on, now, that is not true, Uncle Phil.
I mean, this whole college thing is just kind of new to me.
Bull!
It's old territory.
I mean, you're always going on about how you want to be out on your own and get respect.
But you don't do anything to earn it.
I think it's my break time.
What the hell is wrong with you, anyway?
I mean, you're smart, you're charming.
You have gifts that other people would kill to have.
And what do you do?
You throw it away by taking the easy road.
Uncle Phil, this is one class.
No, this is not one class, Will.
This is your life.
It's not my life, it's not Carlton's life and you only get out of it what you put into it.
And you are off to one lousy start.
But enough about me, Uncle Phil.
Let's talk about you.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Today's topic of conversation is this glass.
Is it A, half-empty, or B, half-full?
Professor, it's an emergency, you got to come out here.
What's the matter, Will?
Can't move those oranges at the off-ramp?
- I'm serious.
You got to come out here.
- All right.
Hey, listen, just wax philosophically for a few moments by yourselves.
All right, Will, what is it?
What did you want me to see?
- Here it is, the new me.
- What happened to yesterday's you?
Well, yesterday's reality isn't necessarily today's.
You're mastering the lingo.
I'm impressed.
That's good, because I wanna get back in your class.
I'm sorry, Will some other student already took your spot.
No, no.
Hey, come on, Professor Mansfield, please.
You gotta do me this favor, please.
You come to me, my son, asking for a favor.
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse.
I'm gonna let you back in this class.
Thanks a lot, Godfather.
Unfortunately, the class registrar is closed, so you won't receive any credit.
Wait, wait, whoa.
Hold on.
Freshmen have to carry 12 credits.
I mean, I'd have to pick up another class, plus do all the work in this one.
You gotta love the irony, though, huh?
- You got a deal.
- Good, take a seat.
All right.
This looks like a lovely seat right Right over there.
Okay, here's another oldie but a goodie.
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it does it make a sound?
Yes, yeah, yes, it does.
No, no, it don't.
Well, no, well, you know, yeah, it's a tree, it has to, yeah.
Yeah, it Well How big is the tree?
I mean, is it anywhere near a subway or anything like that?
And how close is this forest to the ghetto?
Okay, all right, how about if it landed on, like, a gopher or something like that?
Hey, does the noise that the gopher makes count?
Or what if it falls on Uncle Phil and he hurt the tree?
Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a few courses you might be interested in.
Carlton, thank you very much, but I already have my academic stuff in order.
Good job, Will.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Jackie, now how you gonna play me?
You left me in charge here.
- How come you can't trust me?
- Because I grew up with you.
Now, did you do everything on my list?
Well, yeah, Miss Daisy.
I cleaned the windows.
I cleaned the floor.
I even cleaned the ceiling.
Hey, look, you are talking to one tired freshman here, Miss Boss Lady.
Well, I am impressed.
As well you should be.
Shame on you not trusting me.
Now, you kick butt in that game.
- All right, bye.
- Bye bye.
Hey.
Good job, Harold.
Hey, you know, Agnes.
I don't know why your daughter doesn't call you.
Hey.
Break time's over, Sol.
Look, sweetheart, you can't spend every moment with Nicky.
You have to get over this separation anxiety.
You went through it with Carlton.
Yes, and look at how well he turned out.
You must be very proud.
Vivian, sweetheart I love you and I miss you.
And that's why we're going to have lunch this afternoon at La Teau.
Oh, I'd love to, honey.
But I don't think Nicky is ready for restaurants yet.
I was talking about us, Vivian.
We're going to kiss.
We're going to have a romantic, baby-free good time.
Uncle Phil, I think you should be more concerned with a cholesterol-free good time.
And one of you will babysit.
Big poopy.
- What did you say?
- Oh, I said: "Beg, puppy" to my pretend dog, Ernie.
Fetch, Ernie.
He's gone now.
Philip, honey, can I speak to you a minute, please?
Is this a good idea, honey?
Do you think we can rely on them to take care of the B-A-B-Y?
Who's Bobby?
The baby.
Mom, his name is Nicky.
I'm staying home.
Come on, Geoffrey will take care of the baby.
Come on, let's go.
You only have four and a half hours to say goodbye.
Not to worry, madam.
I'll care for the child as though he were my very own.
We'll draw straws for the little bugger.
Short one loses.
Oh, that would be you, Carlton.
Har-de-har-har, but I've got a class.
Well, wait a minute, I've got a job.
I've got a match.
I've got A date with Mr. Stinky!
Two cappuccinos, please.
Well, I'm hoping you like it dark, hot, sweet and with a spoon in it.
Could you hurry it up, please?
I told that guy over there I'd buy him some coffee.
Poor Todd.
Trying to raise his baby all alone, hold down a job, go to school.
I think it's just adorable.
You do?
I'm the same, baby.
I mean, I'm holding down a job and going to school.
About that baby part, if you ain't doing nothing later, I'm Will, you've gotta help me.
I took Nicky shopping, but I can't try anything on.
I mean, he just lies there watching me get undressed and making these tiny little drool bubbles and He reminds me of Trevor.
- So you take him.
- Wait, wai Whoa, hold up, girl.
I'm working this place by myself.
Jackie's at an away game.
And I ain't got no time for no " give me my bottle and change my didy".
"Wipe my booty".
Oh, Will, your little boy is just adorable.
Well, like padre, like nino, you know what I'm saying?
All right, break it up.
Move on.
Nothing to see here.
Show's over.
Beat it!
- Hi.
- Hi, hey.
I'm Candace.
Could I get a picture of you and your son together?
Oh, yeah, sure.
How do you manage being a single father?
Doesn't it get lonely?
Well You know, the nights is kind of bad.
You know, because I have to be both Mommy and Daddy to little Willie Junior here since Since Tirisha died.
That's it.
I'm not gonna stand another minute and listen - Hey!
Isn't that who played Greg Brady?
!
- Where?
Hey, Greg, wait up!
You are quite a guy, Will.
Just tell me everything about you.
You mean, you want to be our friend?
Yeah.
Hey, little Willie, we made a new friend.
And she can sleep over any time she wants to.
Hi, honey, your dad and I just had the most romantic lunch.
Romantic?
I don't mean to be critical, Vivian but you did mention the baby, what, three or four dozen times?
It was so romantic when you asked that strolling violinist to play my favorite song.
Yes.
And what did you request?
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round".
Vivian.
We used to go to a restaurant and not even be able to make it to the table.
You remember the cloakroom at Mario's Peruvian?
Excuse me, but when did I get old enough to hear this?
Excuse me.
Geoffrey, where's the baby?
The baby?
The baby.
Actually, Miss Hilary insisted on taking him out for the afternoon.
And since the poor girl's still so depressed about Trevor I hadn't the heart to refuse.
Hi, everybody.
Geoffrey, could you give me a hand?
I left the most important thing in the car.
Hilary.
You left the baby alone in the car?
Mother, I would never do that.
How irresponsible do you think I am?
Well, then where's the baby?
I don't know.
Mom, you have to see these earrings I bought.
- The little diamonds spell out - Hilary!
How did you know?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- My baby, come to Mommy.
Coming, Mommy.
Well, wait a minute, Will.
How did you get hold of the baby?
Wasn't Hilary supposed to watch him?
- Hilary?
- What?
Oh, God, it's not like I left him at Sizzler Dad.
Last time I do you people any favors.
Don't worry, Nicky, Mommy's got you now.
The only way I'm gonna get attention here is if I start wearing diapers.
No, Uncle Phil, you got at least five years before you need them.
Vivian.
After what you did, I don't even know how you could look me in the eye.
Easy, like this: Hey.
Look, I won't let you use Nicky for evil anymore.
Next time I'm going to the authorities.
Thanks for the warning, Captain Weenie.
- Will Smith?
- Yeah.
Well, hello.
Buy you lunch today, Daddy?
Yeah, sure.
Man, this is an embarrassment of riches.
But what about me?
You just an embarrassment, man.
Hi, guys.
Jackie, what's up?
Let me get that.
How was the game?
- We won.
- Ta-da.
So, what's been going on here?
Anything unusual?
No, no, actually, it's been pretty quiet.
Good, cool.
So before I forget, would you sign the school paper for me?
Right next to your picture.
Oh, yeah, sure, I don't see why n No!
Oh, boy, are you in trouble.
And I'd like to say, "Hey, I'm here for you" but, heck, I'd be lying.
Look, it's just this little blurb in some dumb school newspaper!
Freeze.
Don't be coming over here with no attitude.
This ain't my fault.
- Whose was it then?
- Well, yours.
- What?
- You heard me.
I'm saying, you know I can't be trusted.
You wouldn't have left me here, none of this would ever happen.
That's it.
I didn't come all the way here from Philly to hear this.
- I am tired!
Get out of my face!
- Don't be up in my grill!
- You need to shut I'm out of here!
- Excuse me, excuse me!
You know what?
- You ain't never gonna change!
- Never gonna change!
- I'm getting the last word!
- I'm getting the last word!
- Oh, no, you're not!
Oh, yes, I am!
- Oh, no, you're not!
Oh, yes, I am!
- Damn!
- Damn!
- Will, hi.
- What?
!
Hey, how are you doing?
That's right.
- A beautiful woman here to see me!
- I should've told you I'm on the paper.
- Hope you're not mad.
- Mad?
No, I ain't mad.
- Then why are you yelling?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I got I got a slight hearing problem.
Deficiency, you know, from my night job at the target range.
Oh, you poor thing.
Listen, I got a class now.
Could you meet me here tomorrow morning, say, around 9:00?
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.
Because I'd love to see that baby again.
I think he has plans.
Oh, well, that's too bad because I was thinking maybe the three of us could do something really special together.
And then while he's taking his little nappy, who knows?
Well, he just a baby.
How important could his plans be?
- You're so cute.
- I know, I know, ain't I?
Okay, so I'll meet you here at 9:00 and you won't be sorry.
Oh, I know I won't be sorry because I got me a woman!
All I need is me a baby.
- Hi, baby.
- Hello, dear.
Are you talking to me?
Of course I am.
I know I've been ignoring you lately.
So would you let me make it up to you?
Maybe.
Oh, all right.
I've seen you both naked anyway.
Sweetheart, I have rented us a suite at the Bel-Air Hotel for tonight.
Now, Carlton is gonna take care of Nicky so I can take care of you.
All right, that's it.
That's it.
I'm tired of this.
Y'all two need some time alone, okay?
You gonna leave Nicky here.
You gonna go get a fly hotel suite.
You gonna chill.
You ain't coming back here till tomorrow.
Come on, let's go pack.
Philip, this is so wonderful.
I have been working so hard, taking care of the baby night and day.
Yes, well, you just lay back and relax and let Daddy take care of you.
Dim the lights, Vivian.
Yes, baby.
You know, sweetheart.
For the longest time, I've had the feeling that the fire in our marriage had gone out.
But now I know that the flame still burns.
Can't get enough of your love, baby.
Vivian?
Vivian.
Vivian.
Okay, look, Nicky, this is very important.
Come on, repeat after me: "Da Da"?
Oh, man.
Oh, hey, sorry, my man, it's only 9:00.
Place doesn't open up till 10.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I kind of lost track of time since I pawned my watch.
No, I don't need to bother you with my problems.
No, hey, hold up, man, it's cool.
Here, have a seat right here.
There you go.
Got a little something for you on the house.
- Thank you.
- Hey, least I can do, man.
You're my inspiration.
Caught you.
Oh, no, it's Captain Weenie and his bag of tricks.
You're despicable.
I went to check up on my little brother this morning and what did I find?
A zucchini.
A zucchini, Will.
Well, I've had enough of your twisted charade.
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Taking you down, mister.
I'm calling Mom and Dad at the Bel-Air Hotel.
You got change for a dollar?
Oh, no, see, you gotta buy something.
Okay, give me a pack of gum.
Sorry, we're closed.
Well, there's a world of change out there, mister and I'm going to find it.
Good morning, Will.
I'm so glad you could make it.
And little Willie too.
Yeah, we came here straight from church.
What's up with that special somethin'-somethin' you promised me?
- Okay, close your eyes.
- Okay.
Now, I knew you wouldn't agree to this if I hadn't kept it a surprise.
A surprise?
What you talking about?
- Surprise!
- Hey, man.
Will Smith, you are live here on the Hart File Show.
I'm your host, Jake Maxwell.
And this is ULA's Father Of The Year.
Guess you're pretty excited, huh, Will?
Sorry, we're closed.
Be open at 10.
Yeah, you better wake up, Vivian.
Olive Oyl is looking awfully good right now.
Oh, sweetie, I am sorry I fell asleep last night.
But guess what.
I'm wide awake now.
Quit it, quit it.
I am not in the mood.
Just move.
You're blocking Bluto.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Why don't you turn on some more of that music.
Oh, yeah, right.
Will Smith, what's it like being a single father here in L.A.?
You know, I'm saying, you know, it ain 't easy.
You know, being a single father like me.
But little Willie Will Willie Junior here makes everything worthwhile.
- Did you see my?
- Let's dance, Vivian, huh?
- Oh, Philip, what in the world?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
That's my baby.
That's my zucchini.
Daddy Will, the Hart File wants to make your life a little easier.
So here's a year's supply of baby products for your son.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
What does he know about babies?
This is his idea of a baby.
Get that fruitcake out of here.
Hey!
Listen, I don't deserve all this stuff.
That's right, young fella, you deserve a whole lot more.
So how's about a holiday in Hawaii?
Oh, look, I can't I'm sorry, did you say Hawaii?
Will, if it's not too painful, could you tell the folks at home a little bit about Tirisha?
Who?
Tirisha, your son's mother.
That Tirisha.
Yes, she's dead now.
I met her after I got back from fighting them oil fires, in Kuwait.
You know, and my hair, my eyebrows and everything had just started growing back.
General Powell said to me: "Yo, homey, you need to get down with a little R and R because you're looking a little singed".
So in China He sent me to China.
And then that's where we met.
It was in a little-known province called Rae Dawn Chong.
And Well, sayonara.
Come on, Will, could you tell us more of your touching story?
I'll just take him out.
But, no, no.
Hold Hold up a second, man.
Look, by a show of hands here how many of y'all got a sense of humor, huh?
All right, look, I ain't no father of the year.
I'm not even a father.
I made all of this stuff up.
And I'm kind of good at that.
This is my cousin Nicky.
And I don't deserve all these gifts.
But this dude here, this guy here, I mean He's the real single father with the real problems.
Give him all the stuff.
Hawaii too?
No, homey, I thought I'd hang on to Hawaii, you know Hawaii too.
And that's another heartwarming moment from the Hart File.
Are we off?
Somebody get me a drink.
You creep.
Just wait till you see what I write about you in tomorrow's paper.
But, baby, I See?
I can tell the truth.
I'm saying, you know, maybe there's a little hope for me yet?
Very little.
Will, I'm out of here.
I just want to say thank you one more time.
Hey, no problem, man.
It actually makes me feel good to do something for somebody who needed it.
I was starting to feel stank claiming that as my baby and everything.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
See this ain't my kid either.
Aloha.
Oh, see, that's so wrong.
You know, Will, if you had pulled a stunt like this when you were in high school God knows what I would've done.
Why, I might've done something like this: I went to check on my little brother and you know what I found?
A zucchi A zucchini.
What?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you found.
A zucchini, Will.
Good luck, Captain Weenie.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I know when to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away But don 't know when to shut up Read them and weep.
This is the best day of my life.
Wait, even better than the day you met the Van Patten family?
Hey, guys.
I remember the best day of my life.
It was when I did the wild thing for the first time.
I cut out of high school to go to Soul Train.
The next thing I knew, me and this honey was knocking boots behind the Soul Train Scrabble board.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You mean you cut high school in Akron, Ohio to go to Soul Train, which tapes in L. A?
Hey, hey.
High school was boring, okay?
Yeah, we believe that one.
Yo, man, I remember my first time.
Right before I came out here from Philly.
Miss X gave me an unforgettable going-away present.
- Miss X. - What was it?
A key chain, Carlton.
What do you think, man?
All I'm saying is she was very special and this true mack here was solid gold.
Man, I remember my first time.
It was everything a young man could dream of.
And it only cost me 35 bucks.
But, of course, things were cheaper then.
That's very touching, Jazz.
Carlton, you've been mighty quiet over there about this here subject.
Maybe he ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lockjaw.
I thought we were here to play poker.
I think he's more used to playing solitaire.
Solitaire!
I guess y'all don't know.
The only problem this stallion has is keeping the names with the faces if you know what I'm saying.
You know, Carlton, tell them about the time.
- Tell them about the time.
- Not that it's anybody's business but my first time will be a loving expression of my commitment to the girl of my dreams.
That's beautiful, Carlton.
I call.
Check it out.
Three kings and a virgin.
If I had a hammer Hey, I do.
Hey, Will.
- Hey, what you doing here?
- I'm here to sign up for the reception.
The dean of the business school's a Princeton alum.
- You know what that means.
- You'll be kissing more butt than Arsenio.
Look, Dean Morgan could be my ticket into Princeton.
Kissing up is a small price to pay.
Well, you know what?
Just try not to embarrass yourself again.
What's that supposed to mean?
Last night, Carlton.
I mean, this innocence thing.
In high school, that was cute.
But come on, you're a man now.
Start lying.
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm waiting for Miss Right.
Carlton, please, forget about Miss Right.
Go for Miss Right Now.
Will, I don't wanna settle for just anyone.
When I was a kid, I used to sit in my tree house thinking for hours about my dream girl.
I can see her now.
She's got beautiful brown eyes and a smile that lights up a room.
- Carl Carlton.
- She'll be a great dresser.
Sophisticated.
Beautiful long, dark hair.
- Carlton - Let me finish, Will.
She'll love everything I love.
Money, lvy League schools and America.
Excuse me.
Can I pay for this Business Week now?
The Princeton game is about to start.
I don't wanna miss the national anthem.
Hey, lady, we were talking.
Look, just a second.
I'll be right with you, all right?
- Carlton, man, it's her.
- You think?
Come on, man, baby is all that.
Go on, step to her and ask her out.
- So you're a Princeton fan?
- Not really.
But my favorite singer is performing the national anthem.
- Who's that?
- Tom Jones.
Stupid, ask her out.
My name's Carlton.
Carlton.
Joann.
There's a TV in the student union.
Maybe we could watch Tom Jones together.
That sounds really nice, Carlton.
Hey, good catch, Carlton.
That girl's a That girl's a damn thief.
She stole that magazine.
Hey!
Bob, Bob.
Bob, calm down.
Bob, judges don't cry.
Bob, this is just an investigation.
Everything's gonna work out fine.
Trust me.
Okay, bye.
Yeah.
Bye, bye.
- He's dead.
- What's going on, Uncle Phil?
That ethics committee is digging up dirt on every judge in town.
It's a witch-hunt, man.
A witch-hunt.
Goodness.
Clumsy me.
Philip, I thought you were getting the car.
- What's going on?
- That committee nailed another judge.
I sure am glad we don't have anything to hide.
Will?
Hey, look.
I found that Chevette.
The body was already in the trunk too.
Honey, come on, we're gonna be late for the party.
I am serious, Will.
You stay out of trouble.
The slightest indiscretion could cost me my job.
G, what is up with you today, man?
I mean, you're seeming all jumpy at anything.
Jumpy?
No, not me.
- Come on, G, you can - Stop persecuting me!
I've done nothing, I tell you.
Nothing.
You just can't get good help these days.
That was the most romantic afternoon I've ever had.
I knew you'd love the Tom Jones Museum.
I'm sorry we didn't make it to the Hall of Sideburns.
Here we are.
Do you live in this hotel?
Oh, just until I find a new apartment.
You could come live at our house.
My little sister is almost 15.
It's time she moved out on her own.
I needed to laugh today.
Thank you.
Well, I don't want this to end.
It doesn't have to.
Will you marry me?
You are too adorable for words.
Can I give you a kiss goodbye?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning.
Well, what time should I come back?
Just toast and coffee this morning, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey's not here, Hilary.
Can he do that?
He was so upset, I gave him the morning off.
I better go check to see how he's doing.
Great, so what am I supposed to do about breakfast?
Oh, here's a crazy idea, Hil.
How about you get it yourself?
Fine.
Bel-Air Hotel?
Get me Room Service.
I was up all night worried sick about you.
Where have you been?
And how come you didn't call me?
Oh, my God, that's my mom's finger.
Get it off my hand.
Pinch me, Will.
I'm in love.
I finally found the woman of my dreams.
And I did it.
The big it.
You mean you and Joann closed the deal?
What are you guys talking about?
Business, Ash.
Here, have some breakfast.
So who put the offer on the table?
She did.
And the terms were so attractive, I jumped on h It.
I jumped on it.
And don't worry I protected my investment.
Come on, come on.
Tell me everything, tell me everything.
- What was that all about?
- Carlton lost his virginity.
I'll see y'all later, all right?
Hold on a minute.
Geoffrey has something to tell us.
Hurry up, G. I'm late for work, man.
I have a confession.
Something so shameful, I had hoped it could remain buried forever.
Oh, I think I got a minute or two for this one.
I hope this doesn't have anything to do with the ethics committee investigation.
I'm afraid it does, sir.
I beg your forgiveness for bringing this pox upon your house.
That's all right, just don't take another morning off.
Okay, Geoffrey, let's have it.
I'm too ashamed to talk about it.
It's better if I show you.
You did a porno movie?
Montreal, site of the 1976 Olympics where some athletes become heroes to their countries and where one man became the shame of a nation.
Geoffrey Butler, a long-distance runner representing Great Britain was descended from a long line of running Butlers.
The hopes of a nation were on this promising runner's shoulders.
Alas, his best was simply not good enough.
Halfway through the race, young Geoffrey Butler hit the wall.
But unfortunately, he would not accept his defeat.
In this amazing footage shot by Japanese tourist, Hashi Takashi Geoffrey Butler's unthinkable actions were captured.
Geoffrey Butler's false victory was short-lived.
The Takashi footage was released almost immediately and the public was outraged.
Geoffrey Butler dropped from sight, never to be seen again.
To his countrymen, he is the shame of a nation.
That's the shameful secret I have kept inside for 17 years.
Hey, hey.
Hey, G, man.
Hey, we ain't laughing at you, man.
I guess we kind of are.
Hey, G, why don't you run into the kitchen and get me something.
Or better yet, take a cab.
Sensitive lot, aren't you?
Oh, Geoffrey, the committee won't care about any of this.
- They won't?
- Of course not.
You're a servant.
Get me some cake.
Geoffrey, what you did was not a crime.
It was stupid.
So you mean I'm not gonna cause you any embarrassment or scandals?
No, no.
Oh, man.
Hey, G, hold on.
You mean, that's why you came to America?
That's right, Master William.
When did you get your green card?
Green card?
What green card?
Welcome to the ULA Business Reception.
Weenie?
You are what you eat, buddy.
Hey, there he is, ladies.
- The love machine.
Okay, one at a time.
- Will.
Okay, two at a time if you think you're ready, baby.
Come on, Will, it's hard enough for me to think about anything else.
Oh, man, I understand.
I remember my first time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She gave you a key chain.
There's Dean Morgan.
Oh, I can't just walk right up to him.
Haven't you learned anything from your experience last night?
You want me to sleep with him?
Carlton, I'm saying when you want something, go for it.
Now, he's over there.
Just walk over and introduce yourself.
Excuse me, Dean Morgan?
Carlton Banks, class of '97.
I read your paper on the rise and fall of IBM.
I call it the feel-good financial analysis of the year.
Let the butt-kissing begin.
Yeah, Banks, Banks.
Yes, you're the chap who wants to transfer to Princeton.
That's my alma mater, you know.
Really?
Well, quelle surprise.
Do you know what it takes to be accepted into Princeton, Mr. Banks?
Inspiration.
And one phone call from me.
Oh, this must be fate.
I had my inspiration yesterday.
I found a woman who makes me believe that anything is possible.
Well, I feel the same way about Mrs. Morgan.
Oh, here she is now.
Sweetheart.
Carlton Banks, I'd like you to meet my wife, Joann.
Hey, it is great to see you two together again.
You've met my wife?
I mean, it is great to see you two together again.
Do I know you?
Well, see I'm the manager of this place, and there's a phone call for you.
Well, who is it?
It's your uncle.
My only uncle died three years ago.
Then you should take the call because it's probably really long-distance.
Excuse me for a minute.
I'll leave you two to get better acquainted.
I don't think that's possible.
Why didn't you tell me you were married?
It's not that simple.
You're telling me.
I mean, this will make it very hard for us.
Carlton, there is no us.
My husband and I are separated but he called this morning and we're working things out.
- But yesterday - No, I was upset.
And you were so cute.
Well, you made me feel better.
Look, I'm not proud of myself.
I love you.
Oh, Carlton.
It was just one night.
I've been waiting my whole life for that one night.
I'm so sorry.
So what happens now?
We say goodbye.
Hey, look, Carlton, man.
I'm s I didn't You have to go through this every time you come up here?
No, I take the ladder.
She used me, Will.
Of all the students in all the universities in all the world, she had to sleep with me.
I feel lower than dirt.
That would be what, rocks?
Yeah, I feel like rocks.
Really dirty rocks.
You were right, Will.
There's no girl of my dreams.
Hey, Carlton, check it out.
How about we go down and we discuss this on solid ground, huh?
I'll buy you some rocky road, baby.
No.
I'm never coming down.
Carlton, you're gonna have to eventually come down.
What happens when you gotta go to the bathroom?
Down the hall, third door on your right.
I'm so stupid.
I'm a stupid, dirty rock.
Carlton, man I've been thinking.
Maybe if I didn't play you so much about being a virgin maybe you would've took things a little slower.
And you would've realized that Joann wasn't "Miss Right".
Maybe if me and Miss X had taken things a little slower maybe we'd be a little better off than we are right now.
Is the almighty Will admitting he was wrong?
Well, there's a first time for everything.
Of course, you know that.
Look, if you don't mind, I really wanna be alone right now.
All right, all right.
Hey, you mind if I use the ladder this time?
- Do whatever you want.
- All right.
You don't hate me, do you?
No.
It's a nice tree house you got here, man.
At least you didn't outgrow your furniture, huh?
Oh, you know what?
I'll never forget my first time, man.
It was right before I went back to - I remember that time.
- You remember that time?
- I remember that time.
- I was there.
You was there?
I remember that time.
I bet she remember it too.
Okay, hold it.
I mess my line up.
That's next year's Emmy right there.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Everything is fine, Vivian.
Tell Ashley and Nicky that I miss them too.
Okay?
Okay, love you.
Oh, kiss your sister for me.
God knows I wouldn't do it.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Well, Daddy, L.A.'s favorite weather girl is ready to go back to work.
- With that on?
- Oh, I know, I'm tired of black too but I want the public to know I'm still mourning Trevor's death.
You know, I just don't think that black is the right color for this kind of heat.
Oh, don't worry, Daddy, this dress is surprisingly cool.
It's like I'm wearing practically nothing.
She's not my daughter.
Dad, when are you gonna get the air conditioner fixed?
It's sweltering in our place.
Yeah, man, it's so hot out there the Uh-Huh Girls just went: Everybody keeps talking about this heat wave.
Maybe I should mention it in today's weather report.
You know, that girl has got the mind of Willard Scott.
Hey.
Come to think of it, you got his body.
Y'all should team up.
No, check it out.
On the serious tip, you got to fix our air conditioner today.
We got some people coming over for a party.
And as good hosts, we'd prefer that they didn't melt.
Sorry, Uncle Phil has left the building.
You're now talking to landlord Banks and he's not fixing anything until he gets his rent.
You'll get the rent when we get the air.
What did you say?
I'm sorry, was I talking out loud?
You know what, Uncle Phil?
Forget it, you win.
We'll just move our little somethin'-somethin' from inside to poolside.
Oh, no, you don't.
No rent, no pool, no party, no nothing.
What does he mean by "no nothing"?
Oh, don't worry about it, it's a double negative.
- What's this?
- A bill for your breakfast.
Dad, this is an outrage!
Three dollars for orange juice?
Oh, and I've taken the liberty of adding a 15-percent gratuity.
Carlton.
Of course you know this means war!
It certainly does.
And we're gonna win, right, Dad?
Girl, let me tell you, switching this to a pool party was a stroke of genius.
Why do you say that?
Oh, couple of reasons.
Girl, I got to tell you, that suit look like a piece of "good God" wrapped up in some "have mercy" with a side of: Really?
I mean, you don't think it's too revealing?
Well, if it is, your secret's safe with me.
You know?
You know?
Come on, let's get out of this heat before I pop something, you know.
Thank you, Chet.
It's good to be back.
Yes, I'm here at the Farmers Market, and as you can see my fans haven 't forgotten me.
Why haven 't you answered any of my letters?
Well, the good news is the heat wave is over.
L.A. Will have a high tomorrow of only 65.
Oh, sorry, that "LA" stands for Louisiana.
Our high will be 112.
Well, they have the same abbreviation.
This is Hilary Banks surrounded by ordinary people at the Farmers Market.
Now back to you, Chet.
Don 't any of you touch me.
I can't believe she wore that dress.
- Would you like a Swedish meatball, sir?
- Don't mind if I do.
Only one, sir.
The rest are for Master William and his friends, poolside.
What?
I can't believe that he would deliberately disobey me!
I wouldn't call it disobedience, sir.
It's more like outright defiance.
That's it!
Dance puppets, dance!
Hi, Carlton.
Hi, Steffi, what are you doing here?
I heard the party and I came to see if Ashley was home.
Well, she's away at her Aunt Helen's.
Now, run along.
I don't think you're age-appropriate for this party.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going swimming.
Hey, Will, any sign of Dad yet?
Well That's either him or a rhino that got his horn chopped off.
I'm going swimming in the neighbor's pool.
Carlton, listen.
We have to stand up to him, man.
If he smells fear, he'll attack.
- How dare you two defy me.
- Now, see here, big guy.
Oh, my God, Howard!
Come on, Will, let's get wet.
Young lady, would you mind putting on some clothes and going home.
Now.
Whoa, baby, baby, baby.
What you doing?
You embarrassing me in front of my friends.
You should have thought of that before you defied me.
Hi, Mr. Banks.
Steffi, do your parents know you're here?
I don't think so.
They're in Aspen.
And I'm in heaven.
She came over here on her own.
Will, I am going back in the house, and when I come out I want all of these people gone.
Well, they will be if you come out in the morning, Uncle Phil.
Wait, wait.
Let me get this straight, young man.
You are telling me what will or will not happen in my own house?
Excuse me, but this is my house.
I pay rent here too, eventually.
You watch how you talk to me.
Well, then, Uncle Phil, stop treating me like a child.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was talking to a man.
That's right.
It's me, Will Smith.
- Oh, well.
- Man.
I guess you're ready to play a man's game, huh?
All right, Will, if that's the way you want it.
Don't come back, neither.
G, is Uncle Phil around?
The coast is clear.
He's in court.
Geoffrey, could you get us some breakfast?
I'm not allowed to serve you anymore.
Mr. Banks' orders.
G, listen, how upset was Uncle Phil last night?
Well, he did something I've never seen him do in all the years I've been here.
What, a sit-up?
It's a bit more serious than that, I'm afraid.
You know the cherry cheesecake, candied yams barbecued ribs left over from yesterday?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness, it's still there.
Oh, I'm afraid.
- Hold me, Will.
- Get off of me, man.
I don't know why I ever listen to you.
I was content having my father push me around for the rest of my life.
Now who knows what he's gonna do to us.
Relax, man, what's he gonna do, sue us?
Oh, gosh, now you've gone and spoiled the surprise.
- What's this?
- Subpoenas from your father.
And may I say, it's been a pleasure serving you.
Case dismissed.
This is the last case of the day, number 1218 Phillip Banks v. Will Smith and Carlton Banks for nonpayment of rent.
Philip, I can't believe you're suing your own son and nephew.
Oh, relax, Lois, this is just a little lesson in responsibility.
They're probably not gonna show up.
In fact, they're probably home now, preparing their apologies.
Looks like they've prepared more than an apology.
Mr. Banks, your opening statement.
I don't have an opening statement.
- Mr. Smith.
- Thank you.
Your Honor, I'm from West Philadelphia, born and raised.
On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
I don't have a big bag of fancy courtroom tricks.
Or a high-priced degree from Princeton like my worthy adversary, Judge Philip Banks.
- But what I do have is the truth!
- Oh, shut up, Will!
Your Honor, Mr. Smith is making a mockery of the entire legal system.
And this man is making a mockery of a finely cut Italian suit.
Order in the court.
Mr. Banks, will you please call your first witness.
- I don't have a witness.
- I do, Your Honor.
Fine.
Mr. Smith, call your first witness.
Your Honor, I'd like to call someone who's not afraid to tell the truth no matter what landlord Banks might do to him.
Someone who knows the plaintiff intimately.
Like a son, one might say.
Oh, that's great, Will, who do we have?
You, dummy.
When we prepared this case, you didn't say I had to speak against my father.
You don't.
Just read it.
"The night was hot, forcing our party outdoors.
Will Smith, who is neat, considerate and responsible smile at me, was having" Smile at me?
Oh, I get it.
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Hold it.
I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor.
All right, I'm guilty!
I'm guilty!
- That will be all.
- You may step down.
Welcome to my turf.
How did I do?
Your Honor, I'd like to call my next witness, Miss Hilary Banks.
Hi, everybody.
Oh, boy.
Will you please take the stand?
Certainly, Your Honor.
Do you swear to tell the truth so help you God?
- I do.
Okay, Miss Banks, you were the previous tenant in the aforementioned pool house, is that correct?
Yes.
And would you please tell us of your experiences there.
Am I under oath?
Of course.
Well, Trevor would come over at about Objection!
That does it!
You may step down.
Mr. Banks, the court would like to know the impetus for this little lesson that's being learned, and make it quick.
I have a 5:00 hair appointment.
Your Honor, I will show that my tenants were openly hostile and defiant leaving me to believe no rent was forthcoming.
Why, I was reading in my study late one night Yo, yo, man, this party is dumb!
No, man, this party is stupid!
No, no, no, this party is crazy, fly, dumb, deaf, doogy!
- You the man!
You the man!
- You the man!
Hi there.
I see you're having a gathering.
Isn't that wonderful.
Hey, Pops, you popped my duck.
I'm sorry, son.
Here, here's $ 100.
Yeah, that's more like it.
Hi.
Will, where's your aunt's gold watch that you promised me?
In time, baby, in time.
Why don't you go on, cool off in the pool a little bit?
Go on, girl.
Hey, hey, look, look, check it out, Heavy P. Now, why don't you take your Humpty Dumpty butt on back up to the main house, because you're embarrassing us out here.
You know what I'm saying?
I understand.
Kids don't like to have adults hanging around their parties, but - Word.
- Well, could you?
Could you turn your music down just a drop?
We have to consider our neighbors.
I am, dude.
Right now I'm considering their 15-year-old daughter.
Hi, Mr. Banks.
Steffi, do your parents know you're here?
To hell with my parents.
Will taught me that.
You know, she came over here on her own, chief.
Oh, I believe you.
Well, I guess I better go back in the house.
Well, I know I can trust you.
I know we've had our differences, but, boy, you're a great kid.
Boy?
!
You call me "boy"?
You better step to me like a man!
Now get to stepping!
Now get to stepping!
Okay, Will, if that's the way you want it.
Oh, please!
Your Honor, that is not the way it went down.
How did it go down, Mr. Smith?
I'm glad you asked me that question.
Check it out, the night was so hot people was pulling up on camels, right?
So listen Gayle, would you mind if I commented on your swimsuit?
Don't tell me, it's too revealing?
Oh, just a little bit, you know.
I've got some old T-shirts in there that I was gonna drop off for the homeless but you're welcome to put one on to cover up.
Oh, Will, my parents adore you.
Oh, Gayle, bring out that book of hymns I was telling you about.
Oh, this heat is unbearable.
I need to take a dip in the pool.
Safety first, my little non-swimmer.
Only if Dad would fix the air conditioner in the pool house we wouldn't have to be out in this sweltering heat.
How could he be so cruel?
He's mad, I tell you, mad.
Stop it.
You will not speak of Uncle Phil that way.
He may be an unreasonable, pigheaded dictator but he is your father and my uncle, and you will show him some respect.
You're right, Will.
Thanks.
It's It's It's him.
Do you know how humiliating it is to have a son who can't swim?
- Listen, Uncle Phil - Silence.
If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.
- Hello, Mr. Banks.
- What's she doing here?
She wandered over, lonely and crying.
I didn't have the heart to turn her away.
Hit the bricks, you little tramp!
Out of here!
And tell your mother your father has a girlfriend!
I'm going back into the house, and when I come out I want all these freeloading parasites out of here!
Yes, sir, within the hour.
- Five minutes!
- Four.
All right, Will if that's the way you want it.
And then he slapped me with a subpoena.
- Thank you, Mr. Smith.
- You're welcome.
Mr. Banks, will you please approach the bench.
Is that victory I smell?
I am disappointed in you for allowing your family relationship to come to this.
- That's what we saying.
- Shame.
Yeah, ju Oh, shame.
In lieu of a written lease, the law stipulates a landlord must provide his tenants with electricity, gas and plumbing.
Yeah.
However, air conditioning is considered a luxury.
Rent cannot be withheld based on a malfunctioning appliance.
Meaning?
- Meaning you'll have to pay the rent.
- Yes!
This will be a good one for the cocktail parties, Philip.
We're going to appeal this decision.
I intend to cite the landmark case of Rhode Island v. Schechter Poultry.
That has to do with the right to hang dead chickens in a butcher-shop window.
Well, then, you see where I'm going with this.
Guess this whole thing got a little out of hand, huh?
Yeah.
Will Look, let's try not to let this ever happen again, huh?
I don't want your hand, I want my rent.
Oh, man, I don't believe Did you learn nothing from all this mess?
Yeah, never rent to relatives.
What did we go through this whole episode for?
- Money.
- Well, you could at least say you're sorry.
Not until you say it first.
Will you please take the stand?
Certainly, Your Honor.
Do you swear to tell the truth, so help you God?
I'm sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Morning, y'all.
- Morning.
- Happy Halloween.
- Good morning.
What is this bill, Vivian?
Two thousand dollars for flowers?
- That's for Trevor's perpetual care.
- What?
He was Hilary's fiancé.
They get you coming, they get you going.
I can't believe it's been two months since Trevor's bungee accident.
Thank God, Hilary seems to be doing better.
For a while there, she seemed so crushed.
Not any more than Trevor.
Hilary is just exhibiting that old Banks resiliency.
Why, if you ask me, I'd say she's back to normal.
Whatever that is.
Guess who I'm going out with tonight?
- Who, sweetheart?
- Trevor.
Hil, Hil, listen.
About you dating Trevor Oh, gosh, how can I put this gently?
I can't, he's dead.
Will, Hilary's been through a lot.
I'm sure she has a rational explanation for what she's saying.
Of course, I do.
There's a TV psychic who can channel Trevor's spirit.
Okay, I owe you one.
His name is Skorpius and I've arranged for a séance.
Hilary, sweetheart.
You don't really believe in this séance mumbo jumbo, do you?
Believe in it?
I spent 300 dollars for it.
Honey, you spent Not on the séance, for the séance.
I needed a new hat.
The 1000 dollars Skorpius is charging, I just put on Daddy's gold card.
Now, I can say goodbye to Trevor.
I don't know.
If you ask me, it would be cheaper to just dig him up.
Skorpius says I need to bring at least four loved ones to create enough psychic energy to reach Trevor.
So, what do you guys say?
I say, thank God, I'm not a loved one.
You don't understand.
Trevor's bungee accident left everything up in the air.
I need closure.
I for one would be happy to go with you.
And I'm sure everyone else here would too.
Wouldn't we?
- Oh, I gotta go do my costume.
- I'll help you.
Me too.
I can't believe you people.
How can you do this to me?
I guess we're just not a close family anymore.
I guess Hilary's wellbeing just is not important.
I guess nobody cares for her the way I do.
I'll go with you, Aunt Viv.
I can go to my party later, okay?
All right, all right, all right, I'm on board.
But it'll cut into my trick-or-treating time.
Oh, all right.
Come on, Will.
Let's go tell Hilary.
Learn from me, child.
Oh, yes, the little kiddies have arrived.
Oh, how I adore dressing up for those adorable little ghosts and goblins every year.
Trick Hey, you forgot your candy!
Geoffrey.
It's Halloween.
It's supposed to be fun for the children.
Oh, tell it to Barney.
Hi, Will.
Oh, boy, I love this.
Halloween, the only night a black man can walk around in this neighborhood with a mask on and not get arrested.
Oh, what a night.
I made a killing.
Twenty-six Milky Ways.
And the Democrats say there's a recession.
What are you supposed to be?
My idol, Macaulay Culkin.
You know why he's my idol?
Why?
Because y'all the same height?
No, because his movies have grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide.
Not to mention, he's one heck of an actor.
Let's go, everyone.
I don't wanna keep Trevor waiting.
What's the rush?
Ain't like he going nowhere.
I hate L.A. Smog.
Where's Will?
I'm sorry, I'm stupid.
I'm stupid.
This is fine, isn't it?
Oh, we got to get one of them in the girls' locker room.
- Wow, this place is really creepy.
- I know.
Who would put a deco table on a Persian rug?
Skorpius.
Hello.
Is anybody here?
I am Skorpius the Magnificent.
I see all.
I know all.
Who are you?
We have an appointment.
We're the Banks Stop, don't tell me You're the Banks family.
I love when a man pulls my chair out.
- Come, come, sit.
- I want to sit close to the door.
That was decent.
That was decent.
Yeah, well.
Nice shot.
Now Make ready to contact the spirits.
Seem like somebody made contact with one too many spirits, you know: Mr. Skorpius, do you really think you can reach Trevor?
- Lf he's up there, I'll find him.
- Hey, look, Skorpius, check it out.
While you're there, see if you can find Marvin Gaye and find out what was really going on.
That was a good one.
I will now make contact with Trevor Collins.
Everyone join hands.
Spirit guides, I summon you.
This humble earthly vessel awaits.
Fill me with your essence.
Seem like some medium ain't paid their electric bill, huh?
I'm getting a message from the spirits.
Oh, they wish me to tell you: "Shut your pie hole".
I feel a presence in the room.
A tall, good-looking man whose life revolves around news.
That's Trevor.
I know his vibration.
Trevor, I think about you constantly.
And I, about you.
I wish I could see you.
I wish I could see you too.
I thought they was boring when he was alive.
Trevor, now that we can talk there's something I've wanted to ask you since the day you died.
Of course, Hilary.
Ask me anything.
Do you know where I left my black suede purse?
Your black suede purse?
Well, now, let me think.
Please.
Come on, man, I could be sucking on some honey neck bone right now.
Oh, the connection is fading.
I'm losing it.
I'm losing it.
Oh, like you ever had it.
- Come back.
- Yes, Trevor, don't go.
Trevor has left the building.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Couldn't we try again?
I couldn't possibly traverse the void again.
Tonight, that is.
Of course, there's always tomorrow.
And miss Saved By The Bell?
I don't think so.
Oh, let's have a look-see.
You know, I could fit you in around 7 right between the exorcism and step class.
- Daddy?
- No, I don't think so.
And I think I'd like my 1000 dollars back, please.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but the spirits don't give refunds.
Uncle Listen, Scrupulous.
I think you should just give my uncle his money back.
We all had a good laugh, but this whole thing is bogus and you, sir, are a fake.
Nobody calls me the F-word.
From this day forward you will bring evil to all those in your presence.
You will end up alone and forever hexed.
I placed a curse on you.
The whole thing gave me the creeps, Geoffrey.
Do you really think a person can be cursed?
How do you think I ended up here?
Hey, y'all, check it out, I got me a party to hit.
So if I hook up with some babe tonight, I promise to practice safe hex.
This isn't funny, Will.
- You ruined my séance.
- Forget the séance.
He may have ruined our lives once this hex kicks in.
Cut it out, Carlton.
There is no such thing as a Oh, my God.
Carlton, what's that hideous thing growing out of your neck?
- What, what?
Where, where?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Never mind.
It's just your head.
Hey, Hil, look.
Trust me.
Wherever Trevor is, he loves you and he misses you.
What about the hex?
Look Macaulay, there's no such thing as a hex.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Yes, this is he.
What?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Oh, that's preposterous.
You're right, I will talk to my lawyer.
Philip, what is it?
The DA says he has proof that I took bribes.
- What?
- How?
I've been suspended from the bench.
My reputation is destroyed, I'm ruined.
Morning, Uncle Phil.
Did you talk to your lawyer yet?
I'm through, Will.
I don't know why, but the DA has it in for me.
I could get 10 years.
Uncle Phil, you're innocent, man.
Dad, I just want you to know that regardless of what happens I'll always be at your side.
Carlton, what the hell happened to your hair?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not falling for that again.
Oh, my hair.
I look like a snow cone.
What happened?
- The hex.
- Oh, Carlton.
That's not it.
That gold stuff must have done something to your hair.
Now, just Just wash it out.
- I did last night.
- Help!
Help!
- Ashley.
- Help!
Somebody turn it off!
What do you mean, that was out?
That was in!
What's going on?
I heard screams.
Ashley was attacked by the tennis-ball machine.
Oh, thank goodness.
For a moment there, I thought you'd found those Polaroids of me in a tutu.
New Year's Eve.
A fellow gets crazy.
You all right, sweetheart?
I think I sprained my ankle, and my big tournament is tomorrow.
Why would the machine go haywire like that?
It's the you-know-what.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's gonna pick us off one by one until we all end up on Unsolved Mysteries.
Would you shut up with this hex.
I mean, it's all just one big coincidence.
- Can I help you?
- Are you Geoffrey Butler?
Yes, I am.
And you must be the woman of my dreams.
You are.
Geoffrey Butler, I'm agent Wanda Davis, lmmigration and Naturalization.
- You're in this country illegally.
- Uncle Phil.
No buts, Butler.
You're being deported.
- Let's go.
- Oh, God.
The hex has gone international.
Don't worry, I'll get the best lawyer in town.
I don't need a lawyer.
What I need is a judge who can be bought off, like you.
I was framed, I tell you, framed.
This is all your fault.
Now, come on, Carlton.
I don't know what's going on here.
But it don't have nothing to do with no stupid hex.
Isn't that right, Uncle Phil?
I don't know what to believe anymore, Will.
Come on, Uncle Phil, not you too.
Vivian.
Vivian.
Jazz.
- Philip, do something.
- Hey, Dad.
Now that I'm going to be in the family maybe we could talk about my trust fund.
- What did you say?
- Jazz and I are getting married.
Over his dead body.
Excuse me, but doesn't anybody care what I think?
No.
Well, Jazz does.
And that's why I've fallen for him.
To think, all these years, I never appreciated you.
I love you, Snookums.
Right back at you, Hilakums.
I'll be in the kitchen throwing up.
We're gonna name our first son after you, Daddy.
By the way, I thought we could get started tonight.
That's it.
This is all your fault.
You got us all hexed.
I want you packed and out of here by tonight.
But wait Wait a minute, Aunt Viv, what are?
- Out!
- Aunt Viv.
Wait a minute, this is me.
Your little Willie.
You know, the adorable, charismatic, sometimes troublesome yet overall wonderful young man you've grown to love.
Don't throw me out.
Listen.
I'll go back to Skorpius, and I'll get us all unhexed, okay?
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
That's strange.
It's open, Mother, come on in.
Who are you?
Will Smith.
Skorpius?
That's my last name.
I'm Ralph Skorpius.
What are you doing in my house?
It's me.
Remember?
The vampire.
You remember the séance, the hex, the: Listen, take anything you want.
Just don't hurt me.
Look, man, I didn't come here to start no trouble.
I just wanna apologize.
What happened to this place, man?
What happened to you?
Anything you see here is yours.
Please, take it all.
Hey, look, Skorpius, man.
Look, I don't know what's going on here, all right?
I just came to ask you to break the hex, all right, man?
I'm begging you, man.
Why are you playing with me?
I think I'm losing my family, man.
I think I'm losing my mind.
Why you can't just break the hex, man?
Break the hex!
I don't want no vase, man.
I just want you to break the hex, all right?
Break the hex!
Break the hex, man.
Can you break the hex?
Break the hex.
Break the hex, man.
Why you can't break the hex, man?
Break the hex.
- Will.
- Break the hex.
Will, Will, wake up.
Will, you were having a nightmare.
Carlton.
Your hair.
Hey, what kind of dream were you having, mister?
Carlton, man.
Listen, we was all hexed and everything.
Everything was going wrong and the whole family was turning against me.
Oh, it was a nightmare, man.
It was so real.
Well, I'm gonna go have some breakfast.
Wanna go?
Oh, yeah.
Breakfast, that's right.
With our family, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's get to our family.
- Morning, y'all.
- Morning.
- Happy Halloween.
- Morning.
What is this bill, Vivian?
Two thousand dollars for flowers?
- That's for Trevor's perpetual care.
- What?
He was Hilary's fiancé.
They get you coming, they get you going.
I can't believe it's been two months since Trevor's bungee accident.
Hey, hey wait a second, guys.
Hey, let's talk about something else here, right?
Thank God Hilary seems to be feeling better.
For a while there, she seemed so crushed.
Not any more than Trevor.
Hey, hey, hey, listen.
How about those Lakers, huh?
Hilary is just exhibiting that old Banks resiliency.
Why, if you ask me, I'd say she's practically back to normal.
- Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.
Guess who I'm going out with tonight?
No, no, no.
Let me out.
Let me out.
- Who, sweetheart?
- Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike?
Trevor.
No!
In five, four, three, two.
But it will cut into my trick or treats.
Here we go.
But it will cut into my trick or treats.
I can't.
I'm just gonna say my line and go.
I can't get it out.
- I cannot get it out.
- Come on, one more.
Hold on, hold on.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Excuse me.
Girl, I hope these Greek clowns clean up after themselves.
A bunch of messy, inconsiderate children.
So which house are you joining?
Girl, you know I ain't into that frat stuff.
It's for a bunch of pocket-protector- wearing, no-social-life-having losers.
Let the pledging begin.
The defense rests, Your Honor.
Will thinks fraternities are a waste of time.
Maybe for him.
But the more activities I'm involved in, the better I look to Princeton.
Besides, these guys know how to have fun.
We're Delta Kappa Tau We'd like to take a bow We got the highest grades And we will tell you how We study, study, study For professional careers We drink a lot of Ovaltine But never any beers Revenge of the Nerds: Part Six.
We're Lambda Kappa Nu Our blood is very blue Our money's old Our cards are gold And who the heck are you?
Where's, like, a big gong when you need one, you know?
Make way for the brothers of Phi Beta Gamma.
Phi Beta Gamma step Black Gold Black Gold Man!
Hey, I guess that's a tough choice, huh, Carlton?
I'll say.
Can I hear yours again?
Well, my gold card has a hologram of Lee lacocca on it.
Excuse us, guys, it's time for a Negro moment.
Carlton, wouldn't you rather join a fraternity where the guys look more like you?
I was.
Didn't you notice we all had alligator shirts on?
- What up, Philly boy.
- What's up, man?
I haven't seen you at the courts lately.
I miss our one-on-one.
Now, Top Dog, you know when it's me against you it's one-on-none.
I can't play on them tired courts y'all be playing on, man.
You haven't been there in a while.
Me and my frat brothers, we raised money and we hooked them rims up proper.
Are you in a fraternity?
And here I thought you had a life.
Hey, man, I run the fraternity.
Hey, why don't you check us out.
Oh, no, man, fraternities ain't my flavor.
See you at the frat tonight.
But, I will have a double scoop of that, though.
Hey, hey, hey.
We also do a lot of work for the community, brother.
Like visit down at the senior center.
And we also tutor kids down at the juvenile hall.
Oh, terrific.
The Princeton people love to see community service on applications.
I wouldn't really have to go to juvenile hall, would I?
I hear those kids are real troublemakers.
We need a little humor down at the frat house.
Well, it don't get no littler than cousin Carlton.
What's up, Carlton?
Top Dog.
Think about it, Philly boy.
You too, cousin.
Us brothers need to stick together.
Yes, sir.
Twenty-six years of marriage and I find you in bed with a cheerleader.
Lazlo, how could you?
Tune in tomorrow for another episode of All My Fault.
What a sleaze.
I hope Mary dumps Lazlo's sorry butt.
Me too.
You think she would've learned after he lied about neutering the cat.
She really hasn't been the same since she had that sex change.
- Yeah, I guess you're right about that.
- Listen to yourselves.
You're caught up in the lives of make-believe characters.
I'll tell you what, Mom, I'll watch the baby go to a museum and take Hilary with you.
Ashley, the only reason we get involved in this kind of stuff is that real life sometimes is kind of boring.
- What's that?
- Harley-Davidson '58 panhead.
I used to date a biker.
- Was that a ride or was that a ride?
- Great.
Maybe next time we can actually hit second gear.
- Philip, what's going on?
- What's it look like, Vivian?
Looks like a bunch of middle-aged men with too much time on their hands.
Hey, we're bikers.
Dan, you're an accountant.
Got a moment, Fonzie?
Are you crazy?
I told you I was gonna buy a bike someday, Vivian.
Well, you also told me you were gonna lose 50 pounds.
A motorbike is so dangerous.
Well, just look at it this way.
If I take a fall, I have a 50-pound cushion.
Honey, you've also got an infant son who needs you in one piece.
I don't see Dan's wife giving him any heat over this.
From what Helen tells me she ain't giving him any heat anywhere else either.
Oh, you women discuss that?
You'd be surprised what we talk about.
Honey, be reasonable.
Get off the midlife-crisis highway and come home.
Oh, yeah, I can't wait to see your first hot flash.
- Uncle Phil, what's up with the bike?
- Look, I bought me a motorcycle.
It was my decision, and I don't wanna hear any more about it.
Must be that midlife crisis thing Aunt Viv warned us about.
- So how are things at school?
- Great.
Dad, I'm thinking of pledging Phi Beta Gamma.
- Judge Morton is a Gamma.
- He's also an alcoholic.
No, that's Judge Martin.
So that's great, son.
You're a real college man now, huh?
Thanks, Dad.
Well, I think I'm gonna go take my nap.
So I take it you're not pledging?
Oh, no.
You know, Uncle Phil, I got a reputation more as a free spirit.
Will, I wouldn't sell fraternity life short.
You might get something out of it.
True.
They do a lot of work in the community and stuff.
The Gammas are a good group.
Why don't you give it a shot.
The frat leader does need a little help with his jumping.
Maybe I'll join as, like, a mercy thing.
That's good.
- So hop on, I'll take you for a ride.
- Oh, that's cool.
Oh, but you better not try none of that run-out-of-gas stuff, mister.
Pledges on behalf of the brothers of Phi Beta Gamma, I welcome you.
The journey begins.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just relax, Magellan.
All right, at this time, I'd like to turn it over to big Brother Top Dog.
- Your pledge leader.
- Attention!
Busters.
I hope you like your new uniforms.
You will be wearing them for a week.
Excuse me, Mr. Top Dog, sir.
Pledge Banks, you only speak when you are spoken to.
Well, are you speaking to me now, or are you?
I'm sorry, but I think everyone here will agree that wearing the same thing for a week is not good hygiene.
Right, fellas?
So Pledge Banks likes to wash clothes.
Actually, my butler handles the laundry.
- Your butler?
- Yes, Geoffrey.
He's a whiz with my fine washables.
Pledge Banks, where are you from?
Bel-Air.
South central Bel-Air.
I live right across the street from the Aaron Spelling mansion.
You know, the producer of Beverly Hills, 90210?
- I don't watch it.
- You don't know what you're missing.
Dylan's on the verge of getting back with Brenda.
You are on the verge of making a fool out of yourself.
They really getting back together, though?
It looks like to me our floor needs a little scrub.
And a wax and a polish too, I might add.
It's a good idea, Pledge Banks.
Pledges, get busy.
And you can thank Pledge Banks for doubling your workload.
No need to thank him all at once, fellas.
- What's up with that fool?
- Who?
Who?
Will's cousin.
Brother from another planet.
Come on now, Dog, you hardly know the guy.
I know all I need to know.
I'm gonna teach him the true meaning of "hell week".
Hello, you poor excuses for pledges.
Greetings, big Brother Top Dog of Phi Beta Gamma.
Today, we're splitting up into groups.
I'm taking Philly boy and money bags to block.
Hey, we're gonna play Hollywood Squares.
Hey, Carlton.
Do you realize that they're working you harder than everybody else?
Nonsense.
Everyone had to help re-tar the parking lot.
Yeah, but the rest of us got to wear shoes.
Yeah, well, it'll all be worth it when I hear them call me "brother".
I gotta tell you, Top Dog, I don't like what you're doing with Brother Banks.
I didn't ask you.
Lazlo, how could you?
Mary, I couldn 't help myself.
Well, Ashley, the museum closed?
I had no idea how much Mary was suffering.
Damn that Lazlo.
Ashley, he doesn't know how much his actions are hurting the people who love him.
That's because he's selfish and self-centered.
I see your mother's been poisoning your minds.
Vivian.
Look, I've come to my senses.
The bike is gone.
- It is?
- Yes, sweetheart.
Motorcycles and black leather will never make me feel as young as the love of a good woman.
With you by my side, I will never grow old.
I love you.
Oh, sir, the body shop called.
They said your motorcycle is completely totaled.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
Oh, and the insurance company said you're covered for the damages to the ice-cream truck but have to pay for that box of Eskimo Pies you ate.
I said, thank you, Geoffrey.
My pleasure, sir.
Will there be anything else?
My favorite soap is about to start.
What would that be, One Life To Ruin?
Sir.
Well, if I told you the truth, you would have said, "I told you so".
Try me.
Okay, well, I accidentally left the bike in gear and it ran into a Mr. Icy Pop truck.
- I knew that bike was dangerous.
- That's an "I told you so".
- It is not.
- Is too.
Philip, what do you want from me?
I don't know.
A kiss.
I broke my bike.
Here I go.
Ladies, let the games begin.
Don't you think it's cruel to have a party before they tell us whether we're in or not?
Well, of course, it's cruel, Carlton, but look on the bright side next year we get to do it to somebody else.
Do you really think we made it?
Hey, look, man, whether we did or not, you hung in there, and I'm proud of you.
You're proud of me?
You've never said that to me before in my life.
- Give me a hug.
- Don 't.
You see, man, that is exactly why I'll never tell you nothing.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Girl, if God made anything prettier than you I hope he kept it for himself.
Okay.
Yo, Dog, did you see baby?
Yo, she was fine.
Yeah, that's just the tip of the iceberg, my brother.
Well then, mush, you huskies.
Hey, Top Dog, do you think the DJ has any Rod Stewart or Neil Diamond?
Gee, Carlton, I don't know.
The last time we played them, the party just kind of got out of hand.
I know what you mean.
You should see what happens at their concerts.
Yo, homey, I'm not supposed to say anything but you have nothing to worry about.
You're in.
- Your word, me and Carlton got in?
- Well, not exactly.
I mean, you're cool and all, but Carlton well, he's not exactly our type.
Say, what do you mean, "not our type"?
Well, Carlton is not like you and me.
You know what I'm saying?
No, I don't know what you're saying.
Will, Carlton doesn't exactly exemplify what I think a Phi Beta Gamma is.
Oh, and what is that?
Well, it's not Ralph Lauren shirts wingtip shoes and corporate America.
We don't need a brother like him in this fraternity.
Man, he is exactly what you need in this fraternity.
I mean, Carlton has been a straight-A student since preschool.
He gives you 150 percent every time.
Look, Will, I realize he's your cousin and you have to defend him but this discussion is closed.
All right.
Carlton.
Carlton, Carlton.
Come on, let's go, I didn't get in.
What?
Why?
Look, I don't know, man.
Come on, just let's go.
How dare you not take Will.
He's full of potential.
That's why we want him.
It's you we don't want.
Me?
But I did everything.
I cooked, I cleaned, I hand-washed your toilets.
Everything your butler does for you.
I'm not accepting no prep school, Bel-Air bred sellout into my fraternity.
- Homey, you can stop all that - Wait, Will.
I got this one.
You think I'm a sellout, why?
Because I live in a big house or I dress a certain way?
Or maybe it's because I like Barry Manilow.
He mean Barry White, y'all.
Being black isn't what I'm trying to be, it's what I am.
I'm running the same race and jumping the same hurdles you are so why are you tripping me up?
You said we need to stick together but you don't even know what that means.
If you ask me, you're the real sellout.
Yeah, that's right, boy.
And in the words of my illustrious cousin: "We will make like a tree and leave".
Hey, look, you don't speak for the rest of us, Dog.
I'm gonna have you kicked out of here.
"Make like a tree and leave"?
I never say that.
It's "make like a banana and split".
I'll keep that in mind, all right?
Lazlo, how could you?
Oh, get over it, Mary.
I'm leaving you for your brother.
Oh, you You've got to tape this for me tomorrow.
Damn that Lazlo.
Hey, are we looking at the newest Phi Beta Gammas?
No.
Apparently, I'm not enough of a brother to be a brother.
What?
Pledge leader said he didn't like sellouts.
Well, who does?
I mean, you wait and wait and when you finally get to the front of the line, everything's gone.
You know, this This really irritates me.
I have worked very hard to give my family a good life and suddenly somebody tells me there's a penalty for success.
I'm sorry you had to go through this, son.
When are we gonna stop doing this to each other?
Well, I wouldn't have to go down to juvenile hall, would I?
I mean, I hear those kids really are you know, bad and messed up.
- Excuse me.
- And I'm gonna go Yeah.
Wow.
Ja Well, the Kamma - The Jamma Gammas are - The Ja The who?

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Family, I have an announcement.
Listen, Playboy is doing a pictorial on the prettiest weather girls from coast to coast.
They're gonna call it "Warm Fronts".
And they want me to be in it.
Absolutely not.
But don't you even wanna hear what I have to say about it?
You heard our father: No!
Carlton, what do you care?
Look, I will not be publicly embarrassed by a potential scandal.
Now, now, don't get your Underoos in a knot, stumpy.
Hilary knows what she's doing.
- Wait a minute, I haven't even decided - Quiet, Hilary.
Work with me here, Hil.
I can see it now: Long afternoons kicking back on a chaise longue watching full-body contact volleyball up at Hef's place.
Hilary, as long as you live in my house, you will abide by my rules.
- And that goes for the rest of you.
- That's telling us, Dad.
Wait.
I am 24 years old, and I can make my own decisions.
Besides Mom said it was okay.
Oh, yeah?
Vivian!
So you said your daughter could pose in Playboy, huh?
No.
I said I didn't like the idea.
But I also said she's a grown woman, and it's her choice.
No daughter of mine is posing in that kind of magazine, period.
You do this to me all the time, Daddy.
I have a mind of my own, and opinions and you never let me express them and What were we talking about?
Hil, I think you were in the process of storming out of here.
Thanks, Will.
So, what do you think?
Look like you got hat-jacked by Woody Woodpecker.
These are the new booster hats.
Help me set up a display.
Sure thing, boss lady.
Oh, Jackie, check it out.
Hypothetical situation: Let's just say, like, a famous men's magazine asked you to pose with nothing but that stupid hat on.
Would you do it?
No way, I don't want just anybody looking at this body.
Has it changed since we used to play doctor?
- Stop it.
- See, you have beautiful teeth.
I didn't even know you had those.
That was fun.
Imagine how much more fun it would be if we was both naked.
Will, you just hit on me from force of habit.
Now, if you really wanna go out with me why not step to me like a man?
Well, okay.
So Jacqueline I wonder if you'd do me the honor of having dinner with me.
Okay.
"Okay"?
"Okay" is all right if I offered you a government cheese sandwich but I'm offering you a buffet of love, child.
Take it easy, homey.
I mean, you asked like a gentleman.
If you keep acting like a gentleman maybe we can get somewhere.
Somewhere that we could talk lying down?
- Will!
- All right, Jackie, I'm sorry.
A temporary cool breakdown.
I'm back now.
Look, so when is good for you?
I don't know.
I was thinking about this afternoon leading into the evening.
You know what the evening leads I'm sorry, I need to have that treated.
- I'm sorry.
- I'll call you later.
Come without the stupid hat, okay?
Hey, girl, I was Would you stop it!
Stop, stop, stop.
Hilary, are you really going to pose in that magazine?
- Why?
Does it bother you?
- A little.
I don't even like to get undressed in gym class.
Ashley, your body is going through some changes and they may seem awkward and embarrassing but I promise you, it's completely normal.
And the discomfort, it's only temporary.
I know.
I look great naked.
It's just that I don't like a bunch of gooney people staring at me.
Oh, you get used to it.
I guess I could kiss heaven goodbye because it got to be a sin to look this good.
You've been playing tennis with the gardener again, haven't you?
You do look great, Will.
Thanks a lot, Hil.
You can help me out.
I need a name of a smoking place to take a date.
Sure, we can talk about it on the way to the party.
- I'm gonna go get dressed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What party?
Well, isn't that why you're all dressed up?
Oh, did I forget to tell you?
I think you're still in the process of forgetting.
Playboy called.
They're having a pool party at the Mansion to kick off the weather girl shoot.
And?
And since you stood up for me with Daddy, I'm taking you.
Yes, I knew that.
Let me tell you, you're the best cousin a brother ever had.
I'm going to the Playboy Mansion.
Well, hello, Hef.
Oh, pshaw.
Don't be silly.
I'm glad I could come.
Oh, Miss December.
Oh, baby, I was gonna call you.
Come here, girl.
Excuse me, Master William if you can tear yourself away from your imaginary friend a Miss Jacqueline's on the phone.
I forgot all about Jackie.
Look, G. G, G If you had to decide between going on a date with a girl you care about and going to the Playboy Mansion, which would it be?
The fact you're even asking, Master William tells me that you really care about the lady.
- I guess I do.
- Admirable.
Tell me, might this young lady have a terminal illness?
No, G, of course not.
Then may I point out, she'll still be here tomorrow.
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sick.
No, no, no, don't come over.
Because, you know, I could be catchy.
Well, you know, I guess I'll just have to talk to you tomorrow?
Bye.
So when do we leave for the Mansion?
Oh, they don't need you, G. They're fully staffed.
Either that is one tight dress or a really good paint job.
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute, Will.
- I think I'm having second thoughts.
- What do you mean?
I don't know if doing the layout is worth having Daddy hate me the rest of my life.
No, no, no, it's only the rest of his life.
After them pictures come out, how much longer could he have?
- Will.
- I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.
- I thought you wanted to do the pictures.
- Well, I do.
I'm saying you can't just let your pop be pushing you around all the time.
It would be so much easier if only he liked Playboy.
Liked it?
He's got issues in his bathroom from, like, 1964.
Come on, just don't worry about it.
Let's just go to the party.
Freeze!
Oh, look, the Little Republican Store must've opened.
Good joke, Will.
I'll laugh on the way to the party.
Whoa, teeny.
What makes you think you're going to the party?
I'm not gonna miss out on Princeton because she wants to expose her weather balloons.
Carlton, I think Geoffrey's baking cookies.
Oh, no, you don't.
Look, I'm gonna talk to Mr. Hefner and put a stop to this.
My voice will be heard.
You must take me with you.
Sure.
- How can you let him come with us?
- Trust me, he ain't gonna say nothing.
Well, how can you be so sure?
Boy gets hot and bothered talking to average-looking girls.
Five minutes at the Mansion, he's gonna go into meltdown.
I can't believe it, girl.
Yo, it's just like the magazine.
Except the girls ain't got folds in the middle and jokes on their back.
Carlton, stand up.
You're drooling on my pumps.
Come on, you guys.
My legs are like rubber.
Yeah, and your head is like a peanut.
What was it you wanted to say to Mr. Hefner?
I want to tell him how much I love this place.
Hey, look at that swimming pool.
I have never seen so many people in one place I wanted to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to.
Breathing okay?
- Hey, Hugh.
- Will, why are you shouting at me?
- I'm right next to you.
- Not you.
Hugh.
- You who?
- Stop yodeling.
Hugh Hefner.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Mr. Hefner, what an honor.
I'm Will Smith.
This is my cousin Hilary.
Oh, a pleasure.
Hilary Banks.
I'm glad you could make it.
Let me show you around.
- Oh, I'd be honored.
- Relax, guys.
Have some fun.
There are suits in the bathhouse.
Yeah.
You def, Hef.
Why didn't you introduce me?
Hey, Carlton, I gotta be honest, man, I forgot you was even here.
Oh, that's just great.
Hey, Will, isn't that Jazz?
Jazz, what are you doing here?
I'm on the list.
They think I'm the black dude from Mod Squad.
Would you like to have dinner with the children?
- Yes, that would be nice, Geoffrey.
- Too bad.
They're not here.
Then why did you bring it up?
If you don't care where your children are, sir, neither do I. Okay, where are they?
Sir I could never betray their confidence.
They're at the Playboy Mansion.
All except young Ashley.
She's upstairs with her boyfriend.
- That one's on the house.
- Vivian!
Vivian!
Vivian!
Oh, Philip, did you call me?
- Do you know where your children are?
- Sure, they're at the Playboy Mansion.
How come you knew that and I didn't?
- Because they talk to me.
- Why don't they talk to me?
Because you don't listen.
Every time So, baby, what you doing after the party?
Actually, I'll be in surgery.
Looks like everything on that body is in working order.
I'll be performing surgery.
I'm a doctor.
Well, doc, you can check me out anytime, trust me.
I'm a cardiologist.
You need a pediatrician.
Miss March, right?
I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.
Turn-ons: Fast cars, shrimp bouillabaisse and Indian quilts, right?
Very impressive.
- Now, do you remember my turnoffs?
- Do I?
Hairy backs, smokers and abrasive young men who don't know when to shut up.
Bingo.
Girl, what would it take for a guy like me to get next to a girl like you?
Five years and six figures.
Thank you very much.
So tell me about yourself.
I have a boyfriend who plays on the Lakers.
I suppose your boyfriend's a tackle for the Rams, huh?
No, the Raiders.
Get away from me.
Hey, Will.
Hey, this place is great.
I've got two numbers and if I play my cards right, I think she'll give me the other five.
I don't think I'm gonna hang around to find out.
Being here helped me realize how important Jackie Bunny hop!
really is to me.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The bunny hop.
Where's your sister?
She went to Malibu with the weather girls to have their pictures taken.
Go wait in the car, Carlton.
But I was just gonna go talk to Mr. Hefner about Hilary Go get in the car, Carlton.
I really wanna thank you for taking the time to talk to me, Mr. Hefner.
Well, it's always a pleasure to talk to a long-time subscriber.
My man, Linc.
I wanna cut right to the chase here.
It's about my daughter posing for your magazine.
I mean, well, how would you feel if your daughter got involved in this whole world?
Well, my daughter is involved in this whole world.
She runs the Playboy empire.
Okay, let's try this a different way.
Well, look, suppose somebody that you really care about like your wife, suppose she decided to pose?
Well, my wife was the Playmate of the Year and I'm very proud of her.
Don't you understand there are some parents who are not comfortable with their daughters being stared at by millions of people?
I understand where you're coming from.
Look, over the years, I've had to deal with a lot of parents.
You seem like a good man.
Let me put it this way: I promise you, the pictures will be tasteful.
Tasteful?
Oh, yeah, right.
I know what that means.
Well, thank you very much.
Jackie, you're here.
Will, I thought you were sick.
Oh, yeah, I was.
You know, I At least I thought I was.
You know, actually, I had an allergic reaction to bunnies.
So, say, what's up with that date?
I'm sorry, Will, but when you cancelled on me, I made plans to go to the movies.
Cool.
Just call up your little girlfriend and break them.
My " little girlfriend" is 6'2" with a mustache.
What kind of monster are you?
A man is laying up in his deathbed, and you go stepping out on him?
Hey, Will, you and me ain't all that.
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you doing after the movies?
I think that's between me and Tony.
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?
- I got basketball practice.
- Cool.
I'll watch.
- You can't.
You're working.
Mike called in sick.
He probably has what you thought you did.
- Okay, next Saturday night?
- Bachelorette party.
- Christmas?
- I'm going home to Philly.
Then New Year's Eve?
Groundhog Day?
Cinco de Mayo?
Rosh Hashanah?
- I hope you're proud of yourself, Vivian.
- What did I do?
Your daughter is somewhere in Malibu stark naked.
What are you talking about?
She went and posed for Playboy, and you encouraged her.
I did no such thing.
When I talked to her, she hadn't made up her mind yet.
If anything pushed her over the edge it was your usual "do it my way or else" charm.
Don't you start with me, Vivian.
No matter what I did, she's my daughter.
A daughter should obey her father.
In that case, I never would've married you.
Oh, that was different.
Your father had it in for me.
What was it again he didn't like about me?
It was a tie between your family and your temper.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, I sure don't miss him.
God rest his soul.
Sweetheart, listen.
Sometimes a parent has to step back and let their child find their own way.
I'll be upstairs.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
Daddy, I'm sorry, but I've already had my pictures taken.
- It's all right.
- It was my choice and It's all right?
You're not a child anymore.
You're a beautiful woman.
Beautiful enough for Playboy to ask and woman enough to make your own decisions.
No matter what, I still love you.
Oh, Daddy.
So when are your pictures coming out?
They said in about two months.
You understand, of course, I can't be here when they do.
Enter.
It's arrived, Uncle Phil.
I don't wanna see them.
It came in the mail today with a personal letter from Mr. Hefner.
He thinks you should take a look at it.
So do I. You can forget it, because I'm Oh, all right.
Look at that.
She's covered up.
Hallelujah, she's covered up!
But this little girl is not.
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.
You heard our father: No!
Carlton, what do you care?
Look, I will not be publicly embarrassed by a problem of delivering my damn lines.
It won't happen, damn it.
It ain't gonna happen.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm not gonna allow it.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's over!
It's all right, man!
- Let it go, man.
- It's over.
- It's okay.
- All right.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Your health is no formality, Mr. Banks.
A man carrying as much weight as you are at your age has got to face the facts.
Come on, I've kept myself in pretty good shape.
Well, your blood pressure's up.
You've a history of high cholesterol.
- Come on, I've got a heart like a bull.
- Don't take it for granted.
Although the heart is the strongest muscle, it has the most responsibility.
There are a lot of things that can affect your heart.
Morning, all.
- Morning, Will.
- Morning, Master William.
Hey.
- What's up, Aunt Viv?
- Is that doctor still in with your uncle?
Oh, yeah, he sure is, Aunt Viv.
Oh, you know what?
I heard the doctor say he thinks Uncle Phil might have Dunlap syndrome.
Dunlap syndrome?
What's that?
Mean his belly done lapped over his belt.
Hold on a minute.
I'll have you know my father is not fat.
He's just big-boned.
Larger than life.
Yeah, he's also larger than the Volvo.
Will, it's not funny.
Cholesterol is gathering in his arteries stopping the blood flow like rush-hour gridlock.
Hold it, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.
Dad will probably outlive all of us.
Only if he eats us first.
And you wonder why Daddy won't give you money for your little trip to Mexico.
But if you ask me I think it's a waste of time to even consider life insurance.
Now, honey, your father's a very responsible man.
He wants to make sure that if anything happens to him, we'll be taken care of.
That's true.
After all, Daddy has gotten us used to living this fancy lifestyle.
Oh, did I tell you?
I went in on a racehorse.
- Hey, what's up?
- Will.
- Good morning, sir.
- Geoffrey.
- What did the doctor say?
- Everything's fine.
Well, he was a little worried about my weight.
Do you realize you're eating about a million grams of fat?
Thank you, honey.
I'm serious, Daddy.
I'm not gonna sit here and watch you eat yourself into an early grave.
- Okay, then you're excused.
- Fine.
- Hey.
- Ashley, what are you doing?
Something you all should've done a long time ago.
Well, she does have a point, Uncle Phil.
I mean, hey, I'm getting tired of the fat jokes myself.
What is wrong with you people?
I weigh the same thing I weighed in high school.
Yeah, if you add up all four years.
Guess I'm not getting as tired of those fat jokes as I thought, huh?
I'm worried about you, Daddy.
I love you.
Ashley, sweetheart if you feel that way about it, I'll go on a little diet.
- You promise?
- I promise.
- And you'll exercise too?
- Well If you want a good workout, go with me tomorrow.
- Where are you going?
- Shooting the rapids at Dead Man's Falls.
See, my therapist said the only way for me to get over Trevor's death is to confront it.
But Trevor died doing a bungee jump.
I know.
I'm working up to that.
Well, I'm off to my skydiving class.
Whoa, whoa, Hil.
That's not your parachute.
That's my book bag.
That would've been embarrassing.
Yo, Carlton, what's up, man?
What you working on?
It's an assignment from English class.
I'm supposed to imagine myself No wonder you're so depressed.
I figure, 20 years from now, my dad will be taking his seat on the Supreme Court.
We'll still see each other, especially on weekends when he and Mom come by to see me and little Carlton.
You are little Carlton.
And if the family is at all consistent my wife's wise-guy nephew will move in and make my life a living hell.
Your wife?
Oh, this is science fiction.
Oh, Uncle Phil.
Hey, you been out on the courts?
Played a little tennis with Ashley.
I can't remember when I've worked up such a sweat.
And you've certainly earned your lunch.
What the heck is this?
Chicken, sir.
You probably don't recognize it without a thick coating of batter and gravy.
I can't do this.
I can't give up my favorite foods cold turkey with Oh, my God.
Turkey.
With pillowy mounds of mashed potatoes butter-drenched dressing, tiny onions swimming in a sea of cream sauce.
Yo, Uncle Phil, snap out of it, man.
Come on, now, those days are over.
You promised Ashley.
You're right, Will.
You're right, I did.
Geoffrey I could make this worth your while.
Well, sir, for a price I could show you something in a greasy snack.
What's going on here?
Put your hands up.
Step away from the chips.
Listen, Dad, you might not care about how clogged your arteries are but I do, and I'm doing something about it.
- And doing a wonderful job, I might add.
- Shut up, Geoffrey.
The kitchen is officially closed for high-fat inventory.
Come on.
Will, could I speak to you in the family room, please?
Oh, yeah, sure thing, Uncle Phil.
- About what?
- This.
This is crazy.
Come on, what you talking about, Uncle Phil?
Oh, this one's easy.
Ashley hid the remote control, so I have to walk to the TV.
Geoffrey's feeding me all kinds of healthy food.
Why does she hate me, Will?
Come on, Uncle Phil.
I say she's just following the doctor's orders.
You gotta lose some weight, man.
But this is getting out of hand.
Ashley has spies at every fast food restaurant for miles.
You know, I'd give anything for a cheeseburger, Will.
Anything.
Why, I might even finance your little trip to Mexico.
How you trying to play me, Uncle Phil?
Mexico is important to me, but not if it will jeopardize your health.
Look, I know the doctor's telling the truth.
It's just, I've got a lot going on.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
You let me get a running start at this diet.
See?
How much running you talking about?
Well Well, I'll make a New Year's resolution, and by March February you won't even recognize your old Uncle Phil.
And that's this New Year's, right?
Well, you have my solemn vow.
- Well, I'm off.
- What are you dressed for?
I'm learning to drive a Formula 1 racecar.
Hilary, I've had enough of your death-defying stunts.
And I want it stopped now.
What he means, dear is we don't wanna see you taking risks like this.
My therapist was right.
You just aren't nurturing enough.
Mom, I don't think we can go to the movies tonight.
Why not?
No one's gonna be home except for Dad.
I'm afraid he's gonna cheat on his diet.
What?
You don't think you can trust me?
Don't worry, honey, there's no unhealthy food in the house and I'll take the car keys with me.
This is ridiculous.
Okay, I'll put all the local pizza places on alert, and tell them not to deliver.
Doesn't my word mean anything to you?
Of course it does, darling.
Better call the Chinese restaurants too.
You got the stuff?
Right here.
You got the money?
You take a check?
- I'm leaving for Mexico in a hour.
- I don't know if I have that cash on me.
I hope there's an ATM.
I've been buying your food all week.
- I got no problem eating your dinner.
- All right, all right, all right.
Here.
It's good to see you're not wasting time chewing.
See, that's what you get for eating all fast.
Let me get you something for that.
Here's one, Uncle Phil.
Relieves cramps, bloating and irritability.
Oh, no, no, this is Geoffrey's.
- Will - Oh, here's one, Uncle Phil.
It says it relieves gas and I got to be honest the past couple of days you've been a little - No.
- Oh, what you want?
I want an ambulance.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
That's a nice hat.
Thanks a lot, man.
Look, is my uncle gonna be all right?
Don't worry, he's my fourth heart attack today and I already lost one of them.
A two-death day is rare.
I don't care how rare it is.
You better make sure you don't lose this one!
- Will, I can't breathe.
- Hey, my uncle can't breathe, man!
Could be because you're leaning on his air hose.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna be all right, Will.
I'll be fine.
You go with your friends to Mexico.
I'll be okay.
No, no, no.
I'm with you, man.
I'm staying with you till the end.
That was a really poor choice of words.
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
Would you do me a favor, Will?
We are not stopping for no burger.
No, no Would you tell Carlton to look after the family, Will just in case this is my last ride?
Your last ride?
What you talking about, man?
We gonna go for plenty rides in ambulances, man.
I mean, you gonna be all right, Uncle Phil.
Hey, man, he is gonna be all right, isn't he?
Well, if I say he is and he croaks, you're gonna be upset, right?
You're a real people person, aren't you?
I guess.
Hey, if he still wants to stop for a burger I can get Troy to swing by the drive-through.
With the siren on, we don't have to wait in line.
Why are they taking so long with those tests?
The emergency doctor said it's routine with heart attacks.
Where's Carlton?
I left a message on the phone machine.
I was sure he'd be here by now.
This is all my fault.
I pushed Daddy way too hard on the tennis courts.
No, Ashley, it was me.
I scared him half to death with my stupid thrill-seeking.
I'm afraid, dear family, that I am the culprit.
What do you mean, Geoffrey?
Years of my rich sauces, prime cuts of beef sumptuous desserts have certainly gone to his heart.
Yes, but if I wasn't there to excuse his behavior this never would've happened.
Good point.
You can't blame yourself, Mom.
"Oh, go ahead, Philip, have dessert.
You've had a hard day".
"Not to worry, we can let those pants out".
"I'm too tired.
Go downstairs and have a snack".
I hate to interrupt this guilt-fest but I think I have to take the rap for this one.
Well, you have been a little wild these past four years.
Not to mention your negative influence on Carlton.
Let's not forget his constant barrage of fat jokes.
Or his elephant jokes.
Stop it, everybody.
You're making Will feel bad.
No, no, it's cool, Ash.
They're right.
It is my fault.
Especially since I've been sneaking him food for the past week.
- You what?
- Nothing I mean, he said it was only going to be until New Year's.
- How could you?
- Well, it wasn't all bad food.
I mean, the fried rice had bean sprouts in it.
Uncle Phil, I'm sorry, man.
You wouldn't even be in here if I wasn't sneaking you food.
Look, I love you, man.
I never meant to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Uncle Phil, what are you doing there?
I had a heart attack, Will.
Hey, how come you didn't tell me you weren't my uncle, man?
Well, nobody ever comes to visit me.
I crave the attention.
Will, see if he's gonna finish his IV.
Yeah, me bringing you food is what got you in here in the first place.
What?
You think a week's worth of chili burgers put me in here?
Forget about it.
It's from years of not taking care of myself.
Yeah, but I ain't had to help you.
Come on, I hustled you to get food.
Nobody blames you.
A whole room full of people with a different opinion.
Oh, the family's here?
Well, just about.
Carlton's not here yet.
No?
We left a message for him.
He probably just didn't get it yet.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
That's it.
- That Carlton your son?
- Yes.
Yeah, I got a son.
He don't come to visit me either.
- I'll send the family in, Uncle Phil.
- Okay.
Excuse me.
Are you the Banks family?
- Yes, we are.
- I'm Dr. Kevarkian.
Not Kevorkian.
Kevarkian with an A. How's my father doing?
He's going to be fine.
But he's gonna have to start taking care of himself.
Is he still awake?
You can go see him.
- Why don't you take the baby home.
- Very well, Miss Hilary.
Is that Carlton?
Mr. Banks has been asking for him.
Carlton's a little bigger, wears a bow tie.
Oh, doctor, before I leave could I ask you a couple of questions about ointments?
Don't be stupid, Carlton.
What are you doing?
Cleaning the oven.
What's your problem?
How come you're not at the hospital, man?
It says right here on the label to let foam sit for 45 minutes.
My hands are tied.
Carlton, what's the matter with you, man?
- Your father had a heart attack - You don't know that.
It could be acute indigestion.
Even doctors have made that mistake.
Does that window look smudged to you?
Carlton, you're going down to that hospital if I have to knock you out and call an ambulance.
- You come near me, I'll spray.
Man, you don't know how lucky you are.
You can be with your father whenever you want.
You can eat with him and argue with him.
He's there for you.
You know where my father is?
No.
Neither do I. Look, I don't wanna see my father with tubes up his nose, okay?
There's gonna come a time when all he has is tubes up his nose - Not my father!
- Everybody's father!
Except mine because I don't know where the hell he is!
You don't understand, Will.
Yes, I do.
You're selfish.
Your father's resting.
Why don't you take your family home.
Oh, well, they finally fell asleep.
I don't wanna wake them.
You don't sleep?
I've got a lot on my mind, Dr. Kevorkian.
Kevarkian with an A. Call me Russell.
I'm on break now.
You wanna go downstairs and have an early breakfast?
Well, thank you, Russell, but I can't.
- I'm in mourning.
- Your father's gonna be fine.
Oh, no.
See, my fiancé had this unfortunate accident.
That's why I was supposed to go bungee jumping earlier today.
- Dr. Martling said Do you know him?
- No.
He's my therapist.
He thought if I jumped from the same place Trevor ju He didn't exactly say that.
You know how your therapist says one thing and means something else and you have to figure out therapist talk?
- You can never understand - Oh, look at that, I'm being beeped.
I didn't hear any beep.
Dad?
- Are you okay?
- Me?
I'll be fine.
I'll be out of this bed in no time.
How about you?
- Are you okay?
- Me?
Sure, I mean I should've come sooner, Dad, but I was scared.
You're like Superman to me.
Yeah cheesecake is my kryptonite.
I'm sorry I let you down, son.
You could never let me down, Dad.
I love you.
Hey, Superman, ask junior to get me a bedpan.
Whoop, there he is.
Oh, man.
Hey, Uncle Phil, bet you never thought you'd get a standing O in this house?
There was a time I never thought I'd see this house again.
You was probably worried about just seeing this kitchen again, right?
I'm sorry, that's a leftover fat joke.
I'm tripping.
Go ahead.
Well, you get them in while you can.
Soon I'll be a lean, mean judicial machine.
I'll cover all bets on that one.
Daddy, we're not gonna do anything to make you upset ever again.
Oh, by the way, I dented the Mercedes.
Sweetheart, I am so glad to have you home safe and well.
And if you ever do anything to scare me like that again, I'll kill you.
Don't worry, I won't.
I'm lucky to have such a wonderful family.
Even my pain-in-the-butt nephew.
- I love you too, Uncle Phil.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, come on, let's go watch some TV.
- Okay.
- There's still no furniture.
- Oh, that's all right.
Oh, man, we don't have no remote.
Sure we do.
Geoffrey!
Do you realize you're eating about a million grams of fat?
Thank you, honey.
Geoffrey, you're skimping on the provolone, huh?
I'm serious, Daddy.
I'm not gonna sit here and watch you eat yourself into an early grave.
So you're gonna throw a fork at me?
I tried to keep going.
Hold, please!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Will, academic probation is serious.
How could you let this happen?
It's Professor Burton's fault.
He used to be such an easy grader until him and his wife got a divorce.
Then he became impossible.
The last test he gave, I got a four, and I cheated.
No, this is horrible.
Hey, hey, Professor Burton, I hope that ain't my essay you're reading.
Hey, Will.
No, I haven't gotten to yours yet.
I'll finish them tonight right after I move the last of my things out of our Her garage.
Hey, look, well, have mercy on me, man.
You know, I'm on academic probation.
Now, Will, I like you, but I have to be objective.
When I'm at here the university I can't let my personal feelings influence my professional behavior.
I guess I won't be needing that anymore.
Look, man.
Look, I usually keep this on a need-to-know basis.
But you look like you really need to know.
Behold.
My chicktionary.
- A little black book, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.
What are these letters next to the girls' names?
Oh, those are grades.
There's a lot of F's.
That ain't necessarily a bad thing, you know?
- What's the B mean?
- Be prepared for a possible F. Hi, Will.
Hey, look, I'll be right back.
Oh, and G.G.W.A.B. Means Good God What A Booty.
- What are you doing here?
- I need to switch cars.
- Carlton said you have the keys.
- Cool.
What's wrong with your car?
I'm going shoe shopping, I need the wagon.
Bye.
- Who is that?
- Hilary?
Oh, that's my cousin.
- Well, is she involved with anyone?
- Mostly just herself.
Oh, you You know, she She was just telling me today how much she could really use a man in her life.
And You a man.
Oh, good.
Check it out.
I got an idea: Why don't you come over our house tonight, right.
- And I'll introduce y'all.
- Will, I really appreciate this.
A woman like her could really lift my spirits.
Maybe she could do the same for my grade.
Hey, everybody.
I just bought Nicky a brand new crib.
"The Crib Chalet has over 100 features including automatic guardrail-extension infrared climb-out sensors and a built-in busy box.
Some assembly required".
Oh, no.
Carlton, my boy, go put on your work clothes.
Help me.
- I'm not gonna miss a minute of this.
- Here, darling.
Philip, I know what's gonna happen.
He's gonna start in on your nerves you're gonna end up at his throat.
- Oh, nonsense.
This is a perfect time for a father and son to spend some quality time together.
Geoffrey, go fetch my tools.
You mean your knife and fork?
Hey, Hil, you got a second?
- Sure.
- All right.
Sweet Savage Lust.
One of the classics, huh?
It's about this rich, beautiful girl who loses her lover in a terrible accident and spends her nights alone mourning his death.
Where do they get these stories?
Hey, look, Hil you know, Trevor's been gone for months now.
- Don't you miss dating?
- Yeah.
At first, I felt guilty for wanting to.
But I think if Trevor were still alive, he'd want me to see other guys.
Exactly.
Hey, wait right here.
What are you doing?
Hilary Banks.
Scott Burton.
"When a man is in love he endures more than at other times.
He submits to everything".
Boy, don't make me have to turn the hose on y'all two.
- Will.
- Yeah?
What's going on here?
Well, Hil, I figured that y'all might have something in common.
I'm saying, he's an English professor and And you speak some English.
Look, Steve - Scott.
- Whatever.
- I'm really sorry - No, I'm sorry.
I was just so struck by your beauty today, I had to meet you.
I'm terrible at this kind of thing.
You're not terrible.
Shields are down, Scotty.
Fire!
I know this is last minute, but an artist friend of mine gave me some tickets to a gallery opening in Venice.
- That's very nice, Scott.
But don't you think Italy is more of a second date kind of thing.
No, I mean Venice Beach.
Well, it sounds like fun.
- Do I have time to change?
- Well, if you like, but "True loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament".
Well, duh.
Hold up, man, there's no tag on this.
I need a price check on a Peacock athletic supporter.
Size small.
Never mind.
- Will.
- Oh, hey.
I had the best time with Hilary.
Cannot wait to see her again.
All right, man.
Oh, and by the way.
I graded your essay this morning.
The whole class did rather well, but you, my friend, got a B-plus.
Yes.
I got a B-plus.
I'm Will, call me.
I also spoke with your counselor and he's agreed to take you off academic probation provided you do well on my midterm Friday.
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
Oh, but a big midterm on Friday means you're gonna have to spend all weekend grading papers.
I'll make the test one question, open book.
Welcome to the family, man.
All right.
Hey, you know what?
Allow me.
Will, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Hey, Jackie, I can explain.
Explain what?
How you're using your cousin just to get yourself a good grade?
Hey, look, Jackie, it ain't like that.
I know you, Will.
But I still burn with desire for you, baby.
Yo, Jackie.
I'm just looking out for number one.
You know what I'm saying?
You know, you know.
I don't know who you've been talking to, Rhetta.
But, no, I don't be giving my dates grades.
I'm saying, so, so Are we gonna kick it tomorrow night or what?
I don't know.
You know, do a little somethin'-somethin'.
Who knows?
Are you with that?
All right, I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Rhetta, B. I heard somebody made a love connection.
So tell me about your date.
I have to admit it, Will, you were right.
I had fun last night.
Oh, well, trust me, you got dude flipping.
I like him too.
Hey, look, as long as you're going out with Professor Burton, I am A-okay.
- Then that presents a little problem.
- Why, what's up?
Because I am never going to see him again.
Wait, whoa, wait, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean you're never going to see him again?
You was just saying how dope he was.
He has a mole.
Hilary, wait a minute.
I sit in class with this man all day, every day, and I ain't ever seen no mole.
I hardly noticed it too.
But as the night went on, it got bigger and bigger until it was all I could see.
Oh, it was disgusting.
Hey, Hilary, wait a minute.
You can't just dump this guy because of a tiny physical imperfection.
I mean, you ain't perfect yourself, girl.
Oh, stop.
Hilary, listen.
Imperfections are what make people special.
Like in Philly, a big butt on a sister was considered a thing of beauty.
You know, the more back baby got, the better.
I mean, up to a point.
Then, it's just nasty.
But come on, Hil.
You gotta give this guy another chance.
Telephone, Miss Hilary.
A Mr. Scott Burton.
Oh, the mole man.
Tell him I moved.
Hilary.
Oh, all right.
Hello, Spot I mean, Scott.
Yeah, I had a nice time too.
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes, yes.
Sure.
Okay.
I'll see you then.
Well, I did it.
I just hope I don't get nauseous and faint.
Hey, hey, Hil, you know what?
I got a date tomorrow night.
We could just double.
What's that going to do?
I don't know, maybe take your mind off it.
I'll work mole patrol.
Thanks, Will, that's great.
You're the best.
I'll call Scott and tell him.
- Oh, where are we going anyway?
- The opera.
Dad, we started this three days ago and there's no end in sight.
Let's pay someone to finish the job.
Am I keeping you from something more important?
As a matter of fact, yes.
I've got midterms and, eventually, I'd like to move out get a full-time job and start a family.
And when you do, I will help you build one of these for your child.
You won't, because I'll be smart enough to pay someone to do it for me.
And just how are you gonna do that without a trust fund?
Game, set, match.
Now, stop whining.
What's next?
"Locate the red linchpin".
Got it.
"But do not remove it".
Will, the lobster was superb.
Yeah, they gypped us, though.
They only gave us the tails.
Hilary, I got the feeling at dinner that your attention was somewhere else.
Why would you think that?
This is our box.
What is the matter with you?
You are making a mountain out of a mole, Hil.
- The mole, I'm over that.
- Oh.
Well, then, what's the problem?
Did you see how huge his Adam's apple is?
I don't believe this.
Every time he chewed, it kept bouncing up and down and up and down.
I mean, what's in there, a basketball?
I can't look at him anymore.
- I have to get out of here.
- Hilary.
Listen.
That is not a mole or an Adam's apple that you're seeing.
It's Trevor.
You're telling me that Trevor was reincarnated in Scott's throat?
No, look, Hil, what I'm trying to say is that you miss Trevor so much something inside of you won't let go of him.
If you walk out on Scott now this could haunt you for the rest of your life.
- What do you mean?
- Well You might never go out again.
You'll become one of them crazy old women who walk around all day long with a shower cap on with an old raggedy halter-top that say "Jam".
And then you gonna start wearing rhinestone gauchos.
And then, just for no reason, you'll say: Then you'll be eating neckbone sandwiches all the time.
And screaming at your little imaginary dog, Brutus.
- And you know what the worst part is?
- What?
The only man you're gonna be able to get is some fool named Grady who be smelling like menthol all the time and falling asleep in his soup.
Oh, God, I hate soup.
Then you march through those curtains and you look his throat in the face!
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
Hey did we miss the national anthem?
Some fool named Grady.
Is Hilary okay?
It seems like something's bothering her.
No, no, everything's cool, man.
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a turtleneck out in your car would you?
We are trying to enjoy the opera.
I know, it's hard ain't it?
His neck is blocking my view.
It's like watching a snake digest a rabbit.
Hilary.
Listen, it is all in your head.
It's all in his throat.
Young man.
Did you see Throw Momma From The Train?
I can't stand it.
Scott is making me sick.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
My My uncle's got her on this crazy curfew thing, man.
Hilary, listen, I am begging you.
Please go back in there and apologize to him.
It's very sweet of you to worry about me, Will.
- But I'm gonna be just fine.
- Wait, Hilary, listen.
Look, if you leave now, I might get kicked out of school.
What?
Well, see, Professor Burton broke up with his wife and, you know, he was grading really difficult.
So I figured if he was happier, then just maybe So you've just been using me to get a good grade?
No, not at all.
A little.
- Oh, God.
- Wait.
Hilary.
Hil Hey, look, Pavarotti, go in there and tell my date I'll be back in a minute.
Ladies and gentlemen: Le Crib Chalet.
Honey.
I owe you an apology, honey.
Not only did you do a great job, but you did it together with Carlton.
Mom, do me a favor.
Don't have anymore babies.
Hey, Dad.
Did you see this report in Consumer magazine?
It says that the Crib Chalet is the most dangerous crib on the market.
What are you talking about?
According to this, the crib malfunctioned and an infant was tossed 50 feet in the air.
We can beat that.
Geoffrey.
Well Well, that was just one crib.
Well, the same thing happened to twins in Nova Scotia.
Sweetheart, why don't you go read an Archie comic book or something.
Philip, the important thing is that you and your son spent quality time together.
You should be proud of what you built.
Even if it is a deathtrap.
You are just jealous because you don't have son like Carlton to build something with.
Yes, sir, that must be it.
Look: It's a bird.
It's a plane.
It's Master Nicky.
Hilary.
Tonight, I hurt somebody that I really care about.
What about me, Will?
I meant you.
Thank you.
- But you were right.
- I was?
Scott is the first guy since Trevor that I really liked and I guess I got scared and I had to find something wrong with him.
And that Adam's-apple thing was the best you could do, huh?
Well, I never had much of an imagination.
When I was a little girl, I never had any imaginary friends.
I just used to play with Carlton's.
And, God, they were such dweebs.
You really miss Trevor, don't you?
I know it sounds dumb but sometimes I feel like we're still engaged.
I mean, he died so suddenly and I never had a chance to say goodbye.
Well, it's never too late.
I gotta go study for the massacre at little big mole.
Look, Hil, I'm sorry, all right?
Good night.
Good night, Will.
Goodbye, Trevor.
Will Smith studied all night and passed his English midterm.
One week later, he was taken off academic probation.
Two weeks later, he was put back on.
Professor Scott Burton began dating Rhetta.
Shortly after, her parents demanded he be removed from the college.
Hilary Banks is currently dating.
She remembers nothing.
Baby Nicky only made it to 42 feet.
And then, just for no reason, you'll say: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That is insane.
I don't know what he's gonna say.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Guess what I have in my hand.
Do I have to call security?
Before you have me tossed in the clink you might wanna check it out.
Uncle Phil's floor seats to the Lakers.
So, what's up, I'll pick you up like 6, 6: 15?
Will, I appreciate you asking, especially three hours before game time but I'm kind of dating someone right now.
You dating somebody right now?
- Well, how come I'm the last to know?
- I have my reasons.
Oh, I get it, I get it.
You're embarrassed.
Dude is probably some snaggletoothed pie-faced, snausage-lipped, hunchback - It's Hank Farley.
- Heisman Trophy winning fool.
Tonight's Hank's 21 st birthday party.
Hey, Jackie, hey, come on, girl now, you know that Hank Farley is not your type.
I'm saying, you strip away the shoulder pads and the muscles and the dimples and what you got?
- You.
Hey, hey, hey.
Going to the Lakers game, huh, Will?
Well, no, there's been a little change of plans, Uncle Phil.
I'm going to a party.
Ask him if he got any sevens, Hil.
Got any sevens, Daddy?
Miss Ashley, ready for your big date?
- Not really.
- What's the matter, honey?
Did you ever have one of those days when you just don't feel pretty?
No.
I don't know what to do.
Robert's due here at 8 and I can't do anything with my hair nothing looks good on me and I feel fat.
Oh, Ashley, you look adorable.
Oh, that's real comforting coming from my father.
- That's it, I'm not going.
- Ashley, wait.
Look, your date won't be here for another hour.
Let's go upstairs and I'll give you some Hilary Banks beauty tips.
Trust me, I know exactly what you're feeling.
You mean, you've had nights where you felt fat and ugly?
Okay, so I don't know exactly what you mean.
You know, so when I was at Notre Dame, right they put me in the last play of the last game, right.
Of course, when Hollywood got a hold of my story they made it a white dude.
Look, what are you doing here anyway?
Never mind.
I think I'm gonna go have some chips.
I'm gonna I'm feeling chippy.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Will.
- Hey, hey!
Hey, Jackie!
I didn't see you standing in front of the dip.
- Is this guy a friend of yours?
- Who wants to know?
Hank, Hank, Hank And you are?
Where's Hank?
If that was a sorority out there they would know what my name was.
You know, my brother, I was wondering was that the Ohio State game where you fumbled three times?
Yeah, well, I really shouldn't have tried to play with a broken hand.
Well, I played basketball once without a leg.
Then that explains why your jokes are so lame.
Hey, now, was that your call, or did the coach send that in?
Hey, the testosterone is starting to reach a dangerous level.
- Carlton, do you wanna dance?
- You wanna dance with me?
Really?
I thought there was a chemistry between us.
Ever since the day we met, there was an indescribable something Do you wanna dance?
Daddy, I hope you're sitting down.
Well, we all knew that Ashley was, well, cute but with my help, she has turned into an absolute knockout.
So it gives me great pleasure to present: The new Ashley Banks.
Well, isn't she the most gorgeous creature you've ever seen?
Well, honey she looks like you.
I know.
Isn't it great?
I can't wait for Mom to see her.
- When is she coming home?
- I'm not sure.
She's bowling next door at the Spellings.
Ashley, sweetheart, are you comfortable dressed like this?
Well, Daddy, it all comes down to what Robert thinks.
Ashley, aren't we forgetting something?
I am so proud.
Don't move, I need a picture of this.
I'll go get my camera.
Well, Ashley, you look very nice.
Nice?
I look like Honey, I Shrunk the Hilary.
If you don't like what Hilary did to you, why don't you tell her so?
I can't.
It would hurt her feelings.
There's only one thing I can do.
Hello, Robert?
Listen, I can't go.
I got stuck babysitting my little brother.
Yeah, me too.
Well, bye.
Okay.
Say, "Charge it".
Hilary, Robert canceled on me.
And after all your hard work.
Oh, that's awful.
But look on the bright side.
You might have gotten dumped, but you look marvelous.
Ashley, where did you learn to lie like that?
Mom taught me.
Poor Jackie, man.
Stuck over there with that clown.
She got to be miserable.
Go, Hank, yeah!
What would it take for me to get a woman to make that noise?
Probably cash.
Hey, you know what, I can't stand to see her suffer like this.
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Montana, Montana.
Let me show you how we do this in a hip city.
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?
Hank, let me just dance with him this one time, all right?
Whatever you say, baby.
Hey, why don't you go take a steroid break?
Girl, I'm sure glad we got rid of that nut.
You pretty good with your legs, but let's see how you are with your arm.
What?
Arm wrestling?
That's a boy's game.
You're right.
Step up to a man's game.
Matt.
Look, if this is over me, you can just stop it right now, all right?
This is bigger than you, baby.
It's a man thing.
Excuse me.
All right, lightweight, bottom's up.
Freeze!
Will, what the heck do you think you're doing?
- You can't drink.
- Why not?
Because you're underage.
It's against the law, mister.
Thank you very much, McGruff, the Crime Dog but this is the law of the jungle.
It's chump or be chumped.
I know what I'm doing.
A toast to my worthy opponent.
In the words of Public Enemy, "Bring the noise".
Smooth.
All right.
Stop it.
This has gotten way out of hand.
What are you talking about, man?
I only had two.
Look, you've had enough.
Come on, get up.
There, you happy?
Will.
Hey, look, look, listen, man, listen.
I'm not stopping until he does.
Bring it on, Sasquatch.
Look, I've had about all I can take of this damn thing.
Carlton, would you take me home, please?
Jackie.
Yeah, Carlton, have the valet bring around your big wheel.
I'm ashamed of you.
Look, I'm gonna go take Jackie home.
Wait here until I get back.
And you're in no condition to drive, mister.
As a matter of fact, give me your keys.
Hey, hey, what you talking about, man?
I can keep my own car keys.
You understand?
I'm responsible.
I had a puppy.
What happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Give me those keys.
That ain't it.
Just wait here, I'll be back for you.
I hope you're gonna have fun driving my gym locker.
You happy, chump?
Jackie left.
Oh, man, that's really That's a shame.
That's a shame because she's going to miss my tribute to you.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen I'd like to make a roast to Mr. Stank Barley.
Now, listen, listen.
This man is an all-American which don't really matter because we all Americans.
No, but seriously, Spanky here got some moves.
But, he ain't getting no parts of the scoreboard with my girl Jackie because she can see through a chump like you a mile away.
Both of you.
Jock itching, wide receiving, love-to-take-the-snap punk.
Happy Kwanzaa, Crank.
Look at that.
I think he's dead.
And you know where dead people go.
Hey, kid, get up.
What's that, Jackie?
You've got an even smaller bathing suit?
All right, Sleepy, let's go.
Naptime's over.
Oh, man, I feel like death.
Well, you came to the right place.
What the - Are you the caretaker here?
- No, I'm more like a tenant.
Hey, you play poker?
We need a fourth.
A fourth?
There's only two of us.
Now there's four.
Make it three.
Y'all are dead, aren't you?
"Dead" is so politically incorrect.
We prefer the term, "living impaired".
- That's much nicer.
- I can live with that.
Am I dead?
Well, there's only one way to find out: Take the wall test.
The living guys always fall for that.
Come on, sit down.
- Smoke?
- No, no, I don't smoke.
Hey, you shouldn't either, man.
I just gave a health tip to a dead guy.
Somebody's been hitting the vino.
Oh, it's tequila.
I mean, I was just going shot-for-shot with this football clown.
Oh, drinking contests are Nowheresville.
You wanna prove you're a real man, you play chicken.
Now, two guys drive towards a cliff.
The first one that stops, loses.
That's how I got here.
I won.
I'm sorry, let's review here: You went flying off a cliff.
The guy who didn't is probably laying up under your woman right now and you're stuck here playing eternal poker with no chips.
Nice going, buddy.
Hey, they called me yellow.
Oh, please, Rebel-Without-A-Clue it's kids like you who make me glad I never had children.
So you were married?
Yes, but I was so focused on my career that my husband left me.
I think.
I actually never did have time to read that note.
So, what did you do?
I was in publishing, worked with a number one author.
Very competitive, but I pushed and pushed until I made it to the top.
I liked being on top.
I was a real winner.
Is winning really worth going to an early grave?
You bet it is.
Yeah, I always wanted to be the best.
You know, I never even sat down between rounds.
Yeah, I couldn't wait to get back in there and slug it out.
Let me guess.
You died in the ring?
No, during the post-fight interview.
The doctor said the next punch could kill me.
A lucky guess.
You know, if you guys don't mind me saying you all died for some really dumb reasons.
Now, that's where you're wrong.
We may have paid the ultimate price, but at least we had everyone's respect.
Yes, their last respects.
Oh, not again.
Yo, Billy, go back to your plot.
That damn kid won't stay buried.
I don't have the patience to deal with him.
Would you mind?
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure.
- Hey, Billy?
- Who wants to know?
- Oh, my name is Will Smith.
- Can you catch?
Oh, yeah, come on, throw it.
Let's see what you've got.
Oh, some arm you got there, kid.
I know, I was gonna play shortstop for the Dodgers.
Hey, maybe you still will one day.
Billy how did you die?
I was playing ball on the sidewalk.
This car jumped the curb, took me out.
The driver was drunk.
Come on, let's play.
No, I'm not feeling so good, Billy.
I'm gonna just chill for a minute.
Will.
Will.
Will.
Will.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Hey, hey.
You're little.
Don't worry, Ash, there are plenty of men in the sea.
You mean fish in the sea.
No, I mean men, fish don't own yachts.
Look, Ashley, Robert was a jerk for standing you up but he's gonna be sorry he ever did.
Why do you say that?
Because starting tomorrow, not only am I gonna do your hair and makeup but I'm getting you a manicure, pedicure and a mud bath.
People are gonna think we're twins.
Hilary, Robert didn't stand me up.
- I canceled our date.
- Why?
Look, I appreciate you trying to do all this for me but it just isn't me.
I mean, I didn't feel comfortable having Robert see me like that.
I hope you're not mad.
Ashley, you're my baby sister.
I love you.
There's certainly nothing wrong with you wanting to look just the way you are you're just not gonna do the volume I do.
Miss Ashley, a young man to see you.
- Robert.
Oh, my God, I look terrible.
- Stop.
I thought I could help you babysit.
This is embarrassing.
I'm not really babysitting.
You're not?
Then why did you tell me that you Look, it's a long story.
Tell me about it over some frozen yogurt.
Really?
Let's go.
Well, Miss Hilary, I guess beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
Yeah, right.
Man, how could I make such a mess of this stuff?
Well, not rolling down the window before you ralphed in the Volvo was a good start.
Look, why would you even bother competing with a guy like that?
That dude was trying to play me.
What was I supposed to do?
You could have walked away.
That I know The You know, it's like I was watching myself being stupid but I couldn't do nothing about it.
That must be what Chevy Chase felt like.
I can relate.
Remember last Christmas when I had that second slice of rum cake?
The next thing I knew, I was up on the kitchen table with a lampshade on my head singing show tunes.
Trust me, I learned my lesson, man.
I ain't never drinking again.
Come on, I mean, it's a matter of being responsible and knowing your limits.
You know, I almost got in my car and drove home tonight.
Well, let's just be glad you didn't.
Well, I got a lot accomplished today, huh?
I lost Jackie, I lost my self-respect, lost my dinner.
I ain't got nothing left.
Wrong again.
I'm sorry, guys, but I really don't remember my next line.
No, I really don't.
- Is waiting worth the - Okay, we can just keep going.
We can keep going.
We can keep going.
All right.
What?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
You go to sleep, Nicky.
I'm gonna go downstairs and make sure that Geoffrey remembered to put out some cookies for Santa.
Don't eat too many, okay, Daddy?
Daddy, can you tell me about the four middle names?
Come on, Nicky, you've heard that story a hundred times.
I know it, but I forget a lot of it, please.
Oh, all right.
All right.
Let me see.
Most children have one middle name.
But, you, my boy, have four.
And it all began the night before you were christened.
Yes, a lot of things were different back then.
Say, Uncle Phil, can I borrow 50 bucks, man?
Of course, some things never change.
Yes, it was Christmas Eve, 1993.
Everyone's favorite time of year.
You know, these popcorn strings are looking a little skimpy.
But you wouldn't know nothing about that would you, Uncle Phil?
I don't know what you're talking about.
And I suppose this is the one-armed man The Fugitive was looking for, huh?
Hey, all right, thank you.
Yeah.
Hey, little fellow, Santa let you out of the workshop early?
Oh, you like my outfit?
I had jingle bells sewn into my cuffs.
Geoffrey, I need my Santa suit pressed.
We can't have Nicky thinking Kriss Kringle doesn't keep a sharp crease.
Oh, but it's all right for him to think Santa's only three feet tall.
- Hey, Hil, Ash.
- What happened to your coat?
I was mauled in the Saks shoe department.
You need a license to drive, but they'll let anyone shop.
Boyz II Men were at the mall, and they autographed my new CD.
Oh, and I got Nicky the cutest present for his christening.
You may have gotten the cutest, but I got him the best.
Don't be so sure about that, bucko.
Children, there is no point in competing over who got Nicky the best present.
That's right, because you'll all lose to me.
Oh, yeah?
Well, wait right here.
I thought we was gonna wait but we're having a gift-off now?
Okay, that's cool.
Move, move.
Hey, G. Wait till you see the gift that I got Nicky for his christening.
Hey there, G I don 't mean to be rude But take your jelly-roll butt And go get me some food So that's where the cereal box tops went.
What are you talking about?
This is a great present.
Oh, no.
The 18-carat gold rattle from your uncle is a great present.
The handwoven silk sleeper suit from Miss Hilary is a great present.
That is a hand puppet.
Well, I can count on Carlton to make me look good.
He's so cheap, he'd probably make Nicky a vest out of the lint from his pocket or something.
Hey, is Nicky gonna love this or what?
- Will.
- I wasn't doing nothing.
You're not gonna believe this.
Watch what happens when I play my Boyz II Men CD.
Oh, man.
Yo, me and this kid are definitely blood.
Let me tell you what used to knock me out of my high chair.
Remember: Good jam, right?
- Greetings, y'all.
- What's up, Jazz?
I brought little Ricky his christening gift.
Man, a cheap christening gift.
Hey, you mind if I take a peek?
Go ahead, get your peek on.
Jazz, this is a Rolex.
Santa left it in the men's room.
So, what'd you get him?
Oh, l Shoot, man.
I got him a real good gift.
I got him them.
Them?
You got him a Boyz II Men CD?
No, look, come here.
Come here.
I got him Boyz II Men, man.
I used to hang with them back in Philly.
They're going to sing at the christening.
- Will, that's wonderful.
- What's wonderful?
Will got Boyz II Men to sing at Nicky's christening.
- I can't wait to tell Reverend Boyd.
- Aunt Viv Whoa, woman, look I've got to tell Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here!
Well, this is a christening your family won't forget.
Come back here!
As usual, Will had put his foot in his mouth.
But lucky for him, Boyz II Men were in town recording a radio special.
Will managed to sneak in.
This should be cool, man.
Oh, man.
Let it snow, man.
Let it This is a dirty studio.
You all got bugs.
This is a closed session.
You gotta step.
- Hey, hold up, man.
Listen, I know them.
- How was that, man?
Hey, y'all.
Y'all, hey, I'm from Philly, man.
West Philly!
Hey, you know, cheese steaks, Liberty Bell, man, West Philly!
Get rid of him, Charlie.
Nate, I used to play ball with Jerome Brook, man.
- You know what?
He do look familiar.
- I do?
I mean, I do.
Get off of me, get off me.
He said I looked familiar, man.
But it ain't from basketball, though.
You know Nicie Taylor, don't you?
Hey, I guess I do look familiar.
Yeah, I used to date Nicie back in the day.
Listen, I stole her from this old four-eyed, big-lipped dude, right?
Used to be singing these stupid songs on the corner.
- It was him and his three - Yeah.
- Sisters.
It was him and three girls.
- You don't know how much I loved her.
I cried myself to sleep every night about that.
Did I say I was from Philly?
I'm from Pittsburgh, man.
Go, Steelers.
Stealing.
That's what you did.
You see his face, memorize it.
- We don't wanna see him here again.
- Okay, Romeo, let's go.
Look, do you guys validate?
My car So in less than five minutes cousin Will had totally alienated everyone in the group.
Meanwhile, back at the house Daddy, I hate to interrupt, but I have to go potty.
Okay.
Be sure you're back here in two and a half minutes.
Go on.
- Remember to put the seat back down?
- Do you?
Good point.
Anyway, where was I?
Oh, yeah.
Cousin Will had gotten himself into quite a fix.
So he did what most men do when they get their backs against the wall.
He begged.
Nicie.
Nicie, Nicie, baby.
Nicie, baby.
Look, could you just talk to Nate, please?
No?
Where's your Christmas spirit?
You're a nun for God's sake.
Aunt Vy just arrived and she needs you to take her suitcase upstairs.
Then put out another plate of cookies, make fresh eggnog and replace that broken string of lights on the tree.
And wipe that frown off your face.
It's Christmas.
You know, I am really getting sick and tired of Geoffrey's attitude.
Well, you have to imagine how he feels this time of year.
Wash this, carry that, cook this, clean that.
Ashley, what's your point?
We work him too hard this time of year.
We should get him a present.
What am I gonna get him, a mop?
- Let me take your coat.
- Thank you.
Oh, Vy, you look wonderful.
- What, did you lose some weight?
- Oh, yes, I did.
And I guess you found it.
Okay, now I remember where Will gets it from, right?
How come ain't nobody tell me Halle Berry was going to be up in here?
That's my mommy.
Hi, baby.
Oh, all right, Geoffrey, I'll get it.
Your generosity knows no bounds, sir.
Oh, Mom, it feels so good to have you here.
- Yes.
- Listen, listen.
- I got a little problem.
- What's the matter, baby?
Well, it's about Nicky's christening.
Don't you say another word, baby.
Your Aunt Vivian told me what you're doing.
When that group stands up to sing, I'm gonna turn to the congregation and tell them, that gift is from my boy.
Oh, damn.
Come on, Will, turn that frown upside down.
Santa's gonna be here soon, and no one can resist jolly old St. Nick.
You know what?
You're right, Carlton.
You're a genius, man.
- The house looks beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas, Aunt Helen.
- Merry Christmas, baby.
Let me take this.
It's so good to be with the family for the holiday season.
Now, where's my big sister, Vy?
Diva?
- Diva!
- Diva!
Hey!
Helen, it is so good to see you.
Yes, likewise.
I think I'll go change.
Vy, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Good to see you.
Excuse me just a minute.
Helen, let me talk to you just a minute.
Wait a minute, Helen.
Excuse me, what are you wearing to the christening?
If I'm gonna be godmother, I don't wanna walk in church Iooking like the Full House twins.
Honey, I think your wig is on too tight.
I'm gonna be Nicky's godmother.
Vivian asked me herself.
Wait a minute, she asked me too.
I guess she would have asked Janice if she wasn't out of the country.
- Vivian.
- Vivian.
No, you're not gonna leave me alone with these two after they started sharpening their claws.
Did someone say Claus?
Because that's just what this family needs right now.
When you hear this story, you are gonna laugh.
I accidentally asked both of you to be the godmother.
- Isn't this funny?
- That's not funny.
- That is ridiculous.
- Nothing's funny - How you gonna ask?
- Ladies!
It's Christmas.
Let's not argue.
My Santa suit.
It's been stolen.
It's stolen.
It wasn 't exactly stolen, more like borrowed.
Merry Christmas.
Hey, Santa.
Mind the booth.
Gotta tinkle.
What a lucky break.
I can't believe the schedule we made for ourselves.
Yeah, man.
I never thought I'd be working on Christmas Eve.
For real, partner.
Merry Christmas.
I recently received a letter up at the North Pole from a young man whose only Christmas wish was to have you sing at his cousin's christening tonight.
Yo, is this for real?
As real as I am.
Now, listen.
Please, find it in your hearts to grant this young man's wish.
Is there gonna be a reception?
So much food, you'll think a supermarket blew up.
- Beats room service turkey.
- For real.
- Let's go for it, ya'll.
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
All right.
Hey, you guys be at the First Baptist Church of Bel-Air at 5:00.
Hey, thanks a lot, fellas.
Yo, that's that fool that stole Nicie.
Merry Christmas.
Hats, T-shirts, buttons, Boyz II Men paraphernalia.
Get your hats, T-shirts - Why, Vivian and Philip, welcome.
- Thank you.
Reverend Boyd, these are my sisters, Helen and Vy.
Good evening.
Nice turnout.
One too many if you ask me.
- Hello, are you part of the family?
- Yes.
I'm the part of the family who does the cleaning, cooking and mending.
I guess Will's coming with Boyz II Men.
Do you think I should report my missing Santa suit to the police?
I'm sitting next to Vivian.
I don't want my godson smelling that cheap perfume.
That's it.
I have had it.
Do you wanna know who Nicky's godmother's gonna be?
Go on, tell her, Vivian.
Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey!
- Geoffrey!
Somebody spill something?
Geoffrey, nobody loves Nicky more than you do.
Would you do us the honor of being Nicky's godfather?
Oh, madam, I don't know what to say.
This is the best Christmas gift I could ever get.
Thank you.
Hey, how's everybody doing?
Master William, I'm Nicky's godfather.
- Yeah, congratulations, G. - Are Boyz II Men here yet?
Can I have everybody's attention, please?
I wanted to do something special for my cousin Nicky's christening.
You know, everybody was getting him all these big, expensive gifts and everything.
So I said that I could deliver Boyz II Men.
Look, the truth is Merry Christmas, Will.
Because it was such a special honor to have them sing at your christening we took all four of their names, and we christened you: Nicholas Michael Shawn Nathan Wanye Banks.
That's a good story, Daddy.
Can I see my godfather now?
Of course you can.
Geoffrey!
- You rang, sir?
- Nicky wanted to see you.
Oh, yes.
- I love you, godfather.
- I love you too, godson.
Now, get me some hot chocolate.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Why don't you put that down and come sit next to me.
- How's that?
Everything cool?
- Great.
- It worked?
- Perfect, Branford, you hear?
Good, I'm glad you liked it.
So, Will, I'm off like a dirty shirt.
Hey, peace with two fingers, man.
Give J some for me, all right?
There's definitely some perks to working for NBC.
- I call the couch in the living room.
- No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
You can sleep under the couch, you squidgit.
- I'm sleeping on the couch.
- I said no.
Oh, grow up, you two.
I can't believe you're staying here.
Imagine calling an exterminator for a few harmless little crickets.
Supposed to be soothing, for God's sake.
No, Uncle Phil.
I don't think you understand, man.
Now, these ain't them cute little Jiminy-wish-upon-a-star-type crickets.
No, man.
These are big, mean, nasty, bug-eyed take-over-the-human-race kind of crickets, man.
You can borrow my makeup, but the key is subtlety.
You want your date to think you stepped out of Vogue not a clown car.
- Date?
- Tonight's the night.
I go to the movies with Randy, remember?
Randy?
Randy who?
Why wasn't I consulted about this?
Stop pretending you don't know anything about it.
You already gave permission.
You cannot keep little girls from growing up.
I can and I will.
Ashley, come here.
Look, now, seeing as how this is your first real date I think there's a couple things you need to know.
Listen, if you're gonna hold the popcorn, make sure you hold it up in plain sight so when he go reaching for the bucket he don't miss, talking about, "Oops".
And stop at a gas station and make sure that tank is full.
And if he tells you to pull his finger, don't do it.
Oh, man.
Thanks, but it's just a little innocent date.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Oh, you're right, nothing's gonna happen because I want you back here at 9:30.
But the movie doesn't even end until 10.
Well, you can catch the end of it when it comes out on video.
- Daddy!
- Ashley, be back by 10:30.
Ten-thirty on the dot.
Not 10:31, and that's in this house.
Not on the porch, not parked out on the driveway.
Now, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go check the video camera over the front door.
Daddy never gave Hilary a curfew.
He was probably hoping she wouldn't come back.
Oh, that reminds me, I'm gonna be out late tonight.
I'm shooting a commercial for Casual Cup coffee.
That's great.
How'd you get it?
Well, the director said I reminded him of the coffee.
Oh, yeah, he probably thought you was hot, creamy and rich.
Oh, yeah, that's it.
I was pretty sure I wasn't mountain-grown.
Check please.
I guess that leaves the house to just you and me.
I can write my paper while you study for your midterm.
It'll be nice and quiet.
We can clear tables like the study center.
You know what?
I know how we can make it even more like the study center.
I won't be here.
I'll go run some ball.
I'll get with you all later.
But you told me you haven't studied yet.
I haven't.
Look, Carlton, I'm the king of cram.
All I need is three solid hours and I'm cool.
Will, let me tell you a little story about the grasshopper and the ant.
I really don't feel like hearing about you and your little friends, okay?
Just listen.
See, the grasshopper goofed off while the ant worked hard storing up food for the winter.
When the winter came, the ant had food but the grasshopper starved to death.
You know what the moral of the story is?
Yup, even if we were insects, I'd be bigger than you.
All hail, the king of cram is about to take his throne.
This is really sad, Will.
It's 10:30 and you're just now cracking open that book.
No, that's not true.
I cracked it earlier when I had to write down this honey's phone number right next to the periodical table.
Do you wanna hear a little chemistry rhyme?
No, not really.
Here.
Little Timmy took a drink But he will drink no more For what he thought was H2O Was H2SO4 That's how I remember the equation for sulphuric acid.
Oh, look, look.
I got one.
I got one.
Little Carlton was a boy Whose body was short and stumpy He never shut his mouth So I kicked his little rumpy Are you quite finished?
Yup, all ready.
Hey, Carlton, that's really annoying.
Oh, sorry, nervous habit.
Sorry, nervous habit.
Fool.
I am so sorry, Geoffrey, but if I put him down he cries even harder.
So would you mind making up more formula?
Mind?
Madame, you woke me from a most marvelous dream.
I haven't had one this good since I was strip searched at Dulles Airport.
"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry".
Honey, could you hold Nicky just a second?
Wait, Aunt Viv, come on, l He stopped.
Well, these fingers can work magic.
Ain't that what the honeys tell me, huh?
- Okay, it's 10:37.
I'm calling the police.
- Philip.
Police don't need your hysterical calls cluttering up their phone lines.
They've got to catch real criminals.
Like the murderous muggers and thugs that hang around movie theaters after hours.
She's at the mall.
She's not at the Pussycat Theater.
I've never seen a mugger at the Pussycat Theater.
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Banks.
Can I speak to Ashley?
She's not home from her date.
She was supposed - Daddy, I got it.
- Ashley, sweetheart, where are you?
I'm upstairs in my room.
I got home 20 minutes ago.
Come on, hang up, I wanna talk to Connie about my date.
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
All right, sweetheart, good night.
This is too easy.
Are you ready?
Don't I feel like an idiot?
Ashley got home 20 minutes ago.
She's upstairs talking on the phone.
Oh, really?
That's a load off my mind.
I think I'll go to bed.
- Good night, Geoffrey.
- Good night, sir.
Idiot.
Maybe you can hold on to Nicky till he falls asleep.
Well, no, Aunt Viv, listen, I can't.
I have to study.
You can't study if the baby is crying.
It shouldn't take long.
He hasn't slept all day.
All right.
You are getting sleepy.
Very, very sleepy.
Your eyelids are getting heavier.
Your little head is drooping.
Hi, I'm back.
Maybe we should just try a bottle and a warm bath.
Thought you'd never ask.
The coffee commercial went great.
First, I take a big sip of coffee, then I say: Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of Casual Cup coffee.
So rich and fine, tastes just like you ground the beans yourself.
First take, I said, " Tastes just like you found the beans yourself".
We did it again, I said, " When I don't have my head in the crowds".
- So I did it again, and - Hilary.
How many takes did you do?
Only 41.
You think that would tire me out.
But I'm more awake now than when I started.
Stupid question, did you forget to spit after each take?
Why would I spit it out?
I'm nuts about coffee.
It's not made from nuts, it's from beans, so I guess I'm beans about coffee.
Oh, gee, I'd love to stay and continue this fascinating monologue but I have to get some studying done.
I've always wondered, if coffee's made from beans does that make it a vegetable?
Why are you following me?
Don't you have to work in the morning?
Shouldn't you go sleep?
I'd love to go to sleep, but I can't.
I'm wide awake.
See?
Why don't you try doing something boring like reading the dictionary?
- Do you have one?
- Of course, I do.
What do you think is propping up my makeup table?
Finally.
- Carlton, I need your earplugs, man.
- Hey!
Come on, man.
Listen, I can't concentrate.
I read that same sentence like two million times.
If this test covers more than: "Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry", I'm done.
Maybe next time you should promise to yourself not to put things off until the last minute.
You know what?
You're right, man.
And I've been wanting to squeeze your peezy little head like a grape all day long, and now is as good a time as any.
Give me those earplugs.
Give me your earplugs, man.
I'm not sharing anything with you, mister.
Who knows where those ears have been?
That's it.
That's it.
Come here.
Come here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over.
Time-out, Ashley's home.
Ashley?
I thought she was supposed to be upstairs in bed.
Yeah, you also thought Tupac Shakur was a Jewish holiday.
Why is everybody still up?
You know, you're making it very difficult for me to sneak in.
Ashley, even you should know if you're trying to get past Uncle Phil you don't go through the kitchen.
I guess I have a lot to learn.
No, you learn too much.
What you doing trying to run my phone scam for?
Well, it worked.
That's not the point.
Look, the point is you don't realize the dangers that are lurking out there.
Look, Ashley, listen.
Guys are only after two things.
I thought they were only after one.
Well, yeah, but they wanna do it more than once.
- That noise is driving me crazy!
- Daddy's up?
Get down, hide, hide.
Get down.
I can't stand all that chirping.
Geoffrey!
Geoffrey!
You rang?
Where did you last put the insecticide?
In your soup.
Boy, you're a grumpy Gus.
I was having a most wonderful dream.
Amazon women had just bound me with sinuous vines and were taunting me with tangelos.
What the hell is a tangelo?
"'Tangelo', the fruit of a hybrid citrus tree that is a cross between certain varieties of grapefruit and tangerine".
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
I never knew how much fun I could have reading the dictionary.
I mean, it's filled with all kinds of words.
Big words, little words, abbreviations, common phrases.
Can I look up a word for you?
- Go away.
- Oh, that's two words.
- This will take care of that little sucker.
- Sir, that's air freshener.
Well, it's all we have.
It might work.
Yes, perhaps the scent of sea breeze will recall some painful memory for him, and then he'll commit suicide.
Quick, get in here!
You were lucky Uncle Phil didn't catch you.
Well, there's still time.
What's that supposed to mean?
Remember last year when I skipped school so I could pre-register for jury duty?
And a little somebody snitched on me?
Well, missy, the tables have finally turned.
Oh, Carlton, you're evil, man.
Please, don't tell, I'll do anything.
I'll clean your room.
I'll polish your Star Trek figurines.
No.
Now it's coming from the kitchen.
Get down, get down!
That cricket sounds like it's coming from two places at once.
Must be the ventriloquist of the animal kingdom.
You know, Dad, I think it's coming from this side of the counter.
No, you know, Uncle Phil I think he's over here, the sneaky little bugger.
I was right the first time.
It's coming from the family room.
Come on.
I'll hunt that cricket if it's the last thing I do.
His head will make a fine trophy, sir.
Carlton, you stink.
You just go ahead outside.
I'll go upstairs and get your pajamas.
You can put them on and pretend you just came down for a snack.
My God, that bug isn't gonna get the best of me.
Now I know how Captain Ahab felt when he was chasing Moby Dick.
Between the two of you, the cricket is the whale?
Geoffrey.
- How'd you like to be unemployed?
- What do you mean?
"Unemployed.
Out of work, jobless, not being used.
I.E., a person who does not have a job".
See, the answer is right at your fingertips.
- Here.
Put those on.
- Okay.
Oh, man, I don't believe this.
- Oh, my God, it's 1:30.
- That's true.
And it's a shame you always have to learn the hard way.
As for me, I'm just finishing my paper.
Can't stand it anymore.
This chirping is boring a hole straight into my skull.
There she blows, captain.
By the table!
By the table!
I got him.
I killed that little sucker.
Philip, stop charging about like a rogue elephant.
- You're lucky you didn't wake Nicky up.
- My paper.
Thirty pages of genius gone.
Oh, well.
I guess sometimes that little hardworking head just gets squashed into a little black spot, huh?
That's funny, ain't it?
Listen, you did all this hard work, I didn't do anything and we're both in the same boat.
- Except that my paper was optional.
- Optional?
Yeah, I was only doing it to get in good with the professor.
Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to bring him some cupcakes.
Hello.
This is Philip Banks.
Well, no, I haven't seen Randy and Ashley's been home since 10:30.
Well, I'll call you back if she knows anything.
That was Randy's father.
Apparently, Randy decided to go somewhere else after dropping Ashley off.
Thank God I have a responsible child.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey.
Hey, man.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go ask Ashley if she knows where Randy went.
Oh, man, you're not gonna just go up there and wake her up, are you?
I mean, she could already have morning breath.
Will, please.
Randy's father has a very serious problem.
If she did something like that, I'd throttle her.
No, no, no.
Throttling isn't anything like killing, is it?
Not exactly.
The second definition of throttle is, "To strangle, choke".
Killing is the result of throttling.
Either way, I think we're about to see a demonstration.
Ashley's not in her room!
I'm right here, Daddy.
I was just in the kitchen getting a snack.
We were just in the kitchen.
- I mean the kitchen in the pool house.
- The pool house is being fumigated.
Where am I?
What am I doing down here?
I must have been sleepwalking.
I better go back to my room.
Ashley.
You've already lied once tonight.
Let's not make it a habit.
Daddy, none of my other friends had a curfew.
If I came home at 10:30, everyone would think I was a baby.
You have to realize that I'm growing up.
Sweetheart, I am your father.
It is my job to protect you.
It's a job I refuse to quit, and at which I can't afford to fail.
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.
Of course, you won't, sweetheart.
- Because you're grounded for 10 years.
- Ten years?
Or whenever you move out of the house.
Whatever comes first.
- That's not fair.
- Tell it to the judge.
Oh, that's me.
I killed the cricket.
What a horrible death.
- But, Dad, you can't do that to me.
- Watch me.
But, no!
Ding-dong, the cricket's dead Ashley's grounded Now you all go to bed Will, the house is all yours.
Come on, guys.
"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry".
Come on, Dad, 10 years?
The Menendez brothers will be free before I am.
The Menendez brothers got home on time.
Will, wake up.
Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
Will, it's 8:00.
You don't have much time to get changed and get to school.
Oh, man.
I never even got past the first page.
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Carlton, I'm gonna fail.
Hate to say, I told you so.
So how'd the test go, Will?
I got an 85.
What?
But you didn't even study.
How could you have learned everything you had to know about chemistry?
Well, the only chemistry I needed was between me and the honey in the next seat.
You know what I'm saying?
You have a good winter.
Wait a second, Will.
You're not really gonna let people think you cheated?
Yeah, I know.
I know.
You're right.
You're right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- So how'd the test go, Will?
- I failed.
See, Will, you can't put studying off until the last minute.
I know, I know, you're right.
You know what?
I'm gonna run to the library right now.
And I'm not leaving until I learn everything to know about chemistry.
That's the spirit.
Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of - Cup of hot coffee.
- From the top.
Well, at first I said Oh, shoot.
Damn it.
- Then what did you say?
- I forgot.
And the next take I said, " When I don't have my" Oh, shoot, shoot.
- And the next thing I said - Hilary how many takes did you do?
Only 41.
You think that would tire me out.
But I'm more awake now than when we started.
I'm gonna pass out, you know.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, okay.
Everybody, listen up.
Listen up!
As acting manager while Jackie is away, I'd like to announce a few changes.
Now, due to the numerous requests, the no tipping policy has been waived.
Oh, hello.
Don't forget to pick up your applications for the new and exclusive stockroom clerk.
- So you're in charge now, huh, Will?
- Oh, sure, you're right.
And you know what they say.
Behind every successful man, there's a woman.
But if you wanted to switch positions, I'm with that too, know what I mean?
Hey.
Hey, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come here, girl.
Oh, hey.
Professor Milligan.
How are you doing?
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
You're coming down here to swear me in as the new manager.
You're making the right choice because as you can see, this place is bumping.
Maybe so, but sales aren't.
Take a look.
You throw a good party, Will, but nobody's spending.
I'm afraid you're just not management material.
Wait.
Hey, hey.
Professor Mil.
Hey, listen, listen.
You're not gonna let a silly little thing like profits stand in the way of my promotion, are you?
I'm sorry, I've already made my decision.
I'm bringing in one of the most conscientious freshmen business students for the job.
Very meticulous.
Bakes me fresh muffins every day.
No.
No.
No, he's not: - Well, where did you get this thing?
- They were passing them out at school.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
The I Hate Hilary newsletter.
"Dedicated to the premise that weathercaster Hilary Banks is a boob".
Get to the insulting part.
"Hilary Banks doesn't know the difference between a cirrus cloud and a cumulus cloud".
What is the difference?
Will, look around.
Do you see my TelePrompTer here?
"Hilary's knowledge of the weather is as skimpy as those ridiculous outfits she wears on the air".
I mean, it's one thing to attack my performance, but my wardrobe?
I don't think so.
Yep, every business major at ULA wanted The Peacock but my prospectus blew away the competition.
Who knows?
I could be the next Ross Perot.
I don't know.
Let's see.
Short, obnoxious.
All you need is a bad haircut.
And your ears.
Well, I'm proud of you, son.
Your first job, and you're running the entire operation.
That's right, big guy.
There aren't too many first year students with my level of savvy and maturity.
Fruity Pebbles!
And there's a little tugboat inside, Ross.
You know, Dad, the best part is, this could be my ticket to Princeton.
Professor Milligan says that lvy League schools Iook pretty darn favorably on management experience.
How do they feel about guys who still depend on the crossing guard?
Hey, that's a dangerous intersection, mister.
- Quit putting your hands - Hey, hey!
You two are gonna have to come to an understanding and work this thing out.
All right, all right.
I'm I'm willing to try if you are, boss.
Put it there, Smith.
Well, Geoffrey, this might be a very good experience for both of them.
Especially Master William who will discover the joy of working for a Banks.
Hey, Professor Kemp, Professor Meyers.
Hey, Will, how are the subs today?
Oh, well, you know, sort of like your lectures.
Long, stale and full of baloney.
I'm stupid.
I just failed, didn't I?
Look, check it out, here's a sub on the house.
- Oh, thank you.
- All right.
Instant A. What up, Dex?
Hey, look, man.
I saw Donna the other night down at the quad and I told her breaking up with you was the biggest mistake she ever made.
- So she'll see me again?
- Oh, no, man, she hates your guts.
Hey, but look, there's always more fish in the sea.
I should know.
They call me Aquaman.
Well, I've spent the whole morning back in the stockroom.
What a mess.
Do you believe someone papered the ceiling with hundreds of Jet beauties?
That's fly, ain't it?
I like to think of it as my own Sistine Chapel.
Yeah, well, Phillipe's been in there worshipping for two hours.
Hey, hey, relax little fellow.
You'll get your turn.
Hey, hey, hey.
What up, dog?
Dog?
Will, this is a place of business, not a kennel.
Therefore, you will greet each customer as follows: "Hello, I'm" Your name here.
"Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto is: Whatever you want, we've got it".
I'll give that a shot, Carlton.
Hey, hey, hey.
My name's Will.
Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto is: Girl, whatever you got, I want it.
Will, you're getting it all wrong.
Hey, look, man, as long as I'm getting it.
Look, Will, personal relationships aside I'm your boss, and you have to listen to me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Carlton, you say something?
May I remind you, I'm the one issuing your paycheck?
Yes, sir, General Shorcoff.
That's the spirit, soldier.
I am so frustrated.
What's the matter?
Mom and I wrote down a bunch of meteorological terms for me to memorize, and I keep screwing them up.
Why didn't I become an anchorperson?
They don't have to know hardly anything.
It's commendable that you wanna improve your skills.
You don't have to impress those newsletter people.
I don't want to impress them.
I want to smack them.
Daddy you're a judge.
Can't you just throw them in jail or something?
Sweetheart, the worst thing you can do is blow this thing out of proportion.
Now, if you ignore it, it will probably go away.
Did you really refer to Hurricane Robert as Bobby?
Well, Robert just sounded so serious.
It was serious, darling.
It wiped out half of Miami.
Well, excuse me for trying to spread a little sunshine.
Daddy, I just can't stand the idea of people hating me.
Hilary, people love to attack celebrities.
It's part of the price you pay for being in the public eye.
You're right.
I'm gonna call someone who's been through this.
Who's that, honey?
Someone who knows what it's like to be hated.
Oh, Shannen?
Hi.
Hilary Banks.
You remember that I Hate Brenda thing that you went through?
What do you mean you don't know me?
You spilled a drink on me at Roxbury.
Hello?
Hello?
Boy, she's not gonna make many friends with that attitude.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Carlton Banks, Peacock manager.
And I'm afraid these tables are for eating not loitering.
- We did eat.
- Yes, you did.
Seven minutes ago.
Are you saying we have to leave?
No, no, no.
You can stay if you order something else.
Look, I particularly recommend the shrimpy cocktail.
Will, I could use a little help out here.
I ain't coming out, man!
Fine, then you're not getting paid.
Damn.
Carlton, I think we need to have a little talk, man.
You know bird to nerd.
Sorry, I'm busy.
So, ladies, have you decided?
- Drop dead.
- Excellent choice.
Look around, man.
The Peacock is a place where people just come to kick it, man.
To relax.
You know, get away from the pressures of class.
If you start hassling them, they'll go somewhere else.
Where?
The closest competition is three blocks off campus.
Look, don't you see, Will?
We've got these people by the textbooks.
We can charge and pretty much do whatever we want.
This is like sex to you, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, you know what?
It doesn't turn me on, Carlton.
I think you're being an idiot.
What do you think you're gonna do with that, mister?
Marking up the prices, Will.
Can't let you do that, Carlton.
These people are students.
They're good people.
Decent people.
They can't afford to pay any more.
Save it for someone who cares.
Freeze, man!
Do what you got to do, cowboy.
Hey, give me back my gun.
Listen, as your boss I'm not gonna tolerate that kind of insubordination.
You're not my boss.
You're just some butt-kissing, apple-a-day suck up that got lucky.
Oh, that's it.
That little outburst is going to cost you a reduction in hours.
Well, I'll do you one better.
How about zero hours?
I quit!
Oh, yeah?
Well, well Don't ask me for any recommendation.
I know Will's mad, but this is ridiculous.
I mean, he hasn't talked to me in two days.
What do you think I should do?
Count your blessings.
Hey, what's up G?
- Will.
- No, no.
Will, you can't keep me.
It's not: That's what I said: Well, you can't even right.
Stay out of my face, man.
I'm still not speaking to you.
Fine, be that way.
Master William I've never seen you behave so coldly.
I like it.
Well, G, a man has got to stand his ground.
A man also has to work to pay his bills.
Otherwise, I'd be out parasailing with these.
Seriously, what are you going to do for money?
Already taken care of, G. Got me a brand new job, three blocks off campus.
The Chestless Touchdown.
This is an outrage.
Look, Uncle Phil, I swear that dent was in that car before I hit that mailbox!
- What dent?
- Exactly.
So, what were you saying?
Those newsletter bozos put up a big "Honk, if you hate Hilary" billboard right at the corner of Sunset and Doheny.
Oh, damn.
That mean they took down the Naughty Nightie girl.
Hilary!
Hilary!
More snow today with temperatures dropping to the low teens this evening.
- Sweetheart, l - Daddy, I have the greatest idea.
If I watch the weather in New York I'll have a three-hour jump on the competition.
Honey, that might not work every time.
Listen, when you drove to work today you didn't by any chance go down Sunset Boulevard, did you?
Oh, I couldn't.
It was backed up for miles.
And everyone was honking like it was New Year's Eve.
Chance of snow and a minus three wind chill.
Well, my work is done.
I'm going shopping.
Sweetheart, I've thought it over, you know, and you're right.
I'm gonna put an end this newsletter business.
In fact, I'm gonna head down to the law library and get right to work.
Thank you, Daddy.
Now, dress warm, it's gonna snow.
Please don't go.
Look, I apologize for performing the Heimlich maneuver on you.
I really thought you were choking.
And now, to create a more festive mood The Peacock is proud to present music from Hawaii.
The entertainment charge has already been added into your check.
Also, we are pleased to announce that the proceeds from our new pay toilets have enabled us to buy this brand new metal detector.
Remember, less flatware theft means lower prices for you our valued consumer.
Man, they ought to draw a chalk outline around this place.
Hey, Jazz.
So, what can I get you?
A sandwich?
A T-shirt?
Peacock-a-cola?
- I made that one up myself.
- It shows.
Actually, I just came by to see Will.
Mr. Smith is no longer employed here.
Looks like he took everybody with him too.
They didn't leave because of Will.
They left because of me.
I mean, they just need time to get acclimated to some of my new policies.
Phillipe told me you cut the teeth marks off the pickles and reuse them.
Look, Jazz, I'm in real trouble.
My professor's coming down to check on business.
You know a lot of people.
Maybe you can bring some of them by.
What's in it for me?
Well you know how your pigeons are always getting sick all the time?
My babies.
I'll pay their vet bill for the rest of the year.
Even Oliver?
He has a heart murmur.
- Even Oliver.
- Be back in an hour.
Jazz, what is this?
Pretty good job, huh?
It's nice to have friends you can call on at the last minute.
Oliver.
Banks!
What is going on here?
Professor Milligan.
Well, see, sir.
I've managed to diversify our clientele.
If anybody asks, I've been with you all day.
Banks, I don't know what you've done to this place.
But whatever it is, I suggest that you fix it, or I'll yank you off this project.
But But, sir, what?
Jazz, you better get those freaks out of here immediately.
You're the boss.
All right, you weirdos, beat it.
Daddy, I've got some news.
So do I. I've filed the necessary court papers.
We'll have that newsletter killed in no time.
Daddy, don't you dare.
My ratings this week have gone through the roof.
They're even talking about letting me announce the lottery number.
Well, what about your reputation?
So, what if a few people don't like me?
I'm a hit.
Sweetheart, think about this.
Is this the kind of fame you want?
People are gonna be tuning in, not to hear your weather report but looking for a laugh.
Hello?
You're kidding.
Well, of course, I'm interested.
Who was that?
They're thinking of making me an anchorperson.
I've gotta brush up.
Who is this Bosnia person I keep hearing about?
Forty-eight, 49, 50.
Have fun with them potatoes, spud.
Oh, hey.
Will, I've thought about it, and I can't let you do this to yourself.
Hey, come on, Carlton.
Come back when I'm on a break, all right?
Excuse me, may I cut in?
Carlton, what are you doing?
This is a sports bar, man.
Will, I know you only left The Peacock because of your foolish pride.
No, I left because of my foolish cousin.
Will, you can't be happy here.
This is a franchise.
The kind of place where they treat employees like faceless, anonymous nobodies.
Will Smith, come on up here.
I know you've only been here four days but the staff has voted you employee of the week!
Let's have a hand for Will Smith, huh?
And by the way for winning this honor, you get the weekend off with pay.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- All right.
Oh, Carlton, save me from this hellhole.
Okay, Will, I was willing to let bygones be bygones.
But I can see it's no use.
It is no use, right?
Fine.
I guess the dream is over.
I'm obviously not management material.
All those summers at business camp were just a waste of time.
Oh, Carlton, hold up, man.
Look, you're not a bad manager.
You just stink when it comes to people.
And you stink when it comes to business.
So, what does that tell you?
That we both stink.
Yes, individually.
But together we'd smell like success.
What do you say, Will?
No, man.
I got a good thing here.
Come on, Will.
I'll make it worth your while.
I'll give you priority shifts, and you can wear your own clothes and you've got unlimited use of the stockroom.
- No, man.
- Well, what do you want, Will?
You know, I kind of want you to beg me.
Beg?
I don't know how to beg.
I'm rich.
Look, Will, I'll give you $ 1000 if you come back.
Gosh, you don't get it, do you?
Carlton, it isn't always about facts and figures and green pieces of paper with dead presidents on them.
Look, a man's most valuable possession is his self-respect.
- Make it 2000.
- All right, let me go get my hat.
Hey, hey, hey.
Professor Mil, chill.
Hey, listen, man.
Look Now Listen, hey, listen.
- Hey.
- No, hey.
- Hey, well, listen.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, hey, I got it.
Okay, I've got it.
You ready?
Let's pick it up from right there.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher We are the Peacocks of ULA See, now that's exactly why people be pushing you down the steps.
For your information, I've done the peacock strut exactly nine minutes before each game and we've won every time.
If we beat SCU tomorrow, ULA will be the division champs.
Like you care.
You see, now that's where you're wrong, my little pet peeve.
I hope that ULA whoops their butts tomorrow.
So the fighting peacock within you has finally emerged.
Oh, yes, sir, he came out to bet $500 on the game.
How you disappoint me.
Well, time to open.
Let's put on our helpful faces.
Oh, my God.
Who would do such a thing?
Guess we can rule out Notre Dame.
Thanks, Birdman, you're the best mascot this school ever had.
Thank you.
Hey, Carlton, what was Coach Kelly talking to you about?
Oh, he likes to consult with me before making important game decisions.
So, what's it gonna be, regular or grape-flavored Gatorade?
You can crack wise, Will, but I'm an important part of this team.
None of those guys will leave the locker room before they rub me for luck.
Sure they not just rubbing you for fun, baby?
Rub this, Will.
- Yo, Jazz, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?
Hey, did your bookie take my bet?
You down.
Five C's on ULA.
You are the man.
Who else could have found out that the Mustangs' starting quarterback has come down with the flu?
It pays to have friends at the urology lab.
You know, it might serve them SCU punks right.
Messing up the Peacock.
I've been cleaning this place up all day.
You know, you're getting soft.
The Will Smith I know wouldn't get mad.
He'd get even.
You know what, Jazz?
Tonight, you and I will acquire a vehicle and we're going to acquire the SCU statue.
Swipe Mikey the Mustang?
Now, why would I steal something I can't sell?
Well, the Jazz I know didn't need a reason to do something stupid.
You're right, Will.
What was I thinking?
Here's what we're gonna do.
Daddy.
Daddy, there's a man under my bed and I didn't tell him to hide there.
Sweetheart, he's from the security company.
I'm thinking of upgrading our alarm system.
Hilary, there was a robbery in our neighborhood.
Someone cleaned out the entire east wing of the Spelling mansion.
How are they going to fence all that crushed velvet?
Here they are, family.
Three tickets to the big game.
See what happens when your son's a mascot?
They're right on the 50-yard line.
Won't we be in the way?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go check my head for molt.
You know, Will, it wouldn't hurt if you did something for your school.
Oh, I know, and I am, Uncle Phil.
Tonight, I'm stealing the SCU statue.
Don't even joke about something like that.
I was just kidding, Uncle Phil.
But, well, hey, can I borrow the station wagon?
You know, got me kind of a big date tonight, you know?
Yeah.
- Sure, here you are, son.
- Thank you, thank you.
You know, Will, illegal transportation of a school statue is a felony.
Yes, sir, thank you.
All right, here's the situation, unless you fortify your security system my guess is within six months you'll all be dead.
That's a little extreme, isn't it?
Extreme?
Let me tell you about some of the things I've seen, Mr. Banks.
Homes overrun by thugs and gangs priceless possessions lost forever to ruthless looters.
Mangled bodies of innocent people slaughtered like lambs.
God, where was this?
"Mortal Kombat" by Sega.
- All right, what do you recommend?
- This little baby right here.
Oh, come on, this is a bit much, isn't it?
I mean, Russia has fallen.
Fine, if you don't care about the safety of your lovely young daughters.
All right, all right, all right.
We'll take the ultimate security package.
Move in.
Okay, check it out, check it out.
So we had Mikey the Mustang here wrapped up in blankets in the back of the Volvo, right?
So we about to jet off campus.
All of a sudden: It's like, "Oh, five-0"!
Right, yo, we knew we was busted.
Man, I saw my whole record flash before my eyes.
Yeah, I had to think fast, right?
So I put on this real sincere face before I knew it I had this cop convinced I was Sidney Poitier's son.
Who's the man?
Who is the man?
It's me.
Y'all ain't gotta say nothing, go on.
Get on fools.
Well, I got to go get me a new jacket.
If you need me, I'll be in the lost and found.
Hey, what's that bucking Mustang doing here?
Just a little payback to them SCU fools for that stunt they pulled yesterday.
And you said I didn't have no school spirit.
You must return it.
Carlton, we're just having a little fun, man.
I know how much you hate that, baby.
Don't you understand?
SCU is going to retaliate.
I mean, you've practically given them an invitation to abscond with Percival.
Who?
Hello?
Percival, our beloved peacock.
Look, I'm holding you personally responsible for its safety.
Don't take your eyes off of him.
Oh, but, Carlton, no.
That means I'll miss the big pep rally.
Well, I'm sorry, Will, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Now, if you'll excuse me I have 4000 fans waiting for me in the quad.
Hand me my head.
I'd love to.
It's show time.
Come on, girls, Carlton's rally starts in 45 minutes.
I'm sorry I overslept.
It took me forever to get to sleep.
That guard dog was barking all night.
Can't he be like other dogs and quietly lick himself?
Look, I got this system so that we'd all feel safe.
Now, I just press in our code and we're off.
Fifty seconds to activation.
Please exit the premises.
- Maybe he wants a bone.
- Yeah, one of ours.
No, wait a minute.
What is the release command?
It's something German.
Strudel, schnitzel Mercedes.
- Let's try the front door.
- Good idea.
Come on.
Twenty seconds to activation.
Please exit the premises.
He's a quick little sucker, isn't he?
- Maybe you should shut off the alarm.
- Good idea.
Let me see, our code.
- Ten seconds to activation.
- Code is seven something.
Switching to final countdown.
- Ten, nine, eight, seven - It is Okay, okay, 508 six, five, four - No, no three, two, one.
- Do you mind, please?
Activating security system.
- Daddy?
- I'll call the security company.
Just stand still.
Be still.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just gonna call Intruder, stay where you are.
There is no escape.
Well, at least we're safe.
Five seconds to automated armed response.
What happened to Carlton?
I think my Aunt Helen dropped him on his head when he was a baby.
No, I mean, he's late for the rally.
He usually shows up early to help me with the team seating chart.
He left here about an hour ago.
Well, he never showed.
I got a feeling in my gut something happened to him.
I just know it has.
Look, coach, trust me Carlton wouldn't miss that game for all the cheese in Philly.
- He'll be there or my name ain't - Will!
Is this the end of our plucky mascot?
Does this spell doom for the Fighting Peacock football team?
Stay tuned, same Fresh Prince time, same Fresh Prince channel.
It could be worse.
I mean, he could have been dipped in 11 herbs and spices.
It's 90 minutes before game time.
Any sign of Carlton?
Well, actually, there is a sign.
That's it.
Game over.
We're dead.
He's not exactly Vince Lombardi.
This is how my career is gonna end, huh?
Well, at least I still have my health.
What's that lumpy thing on the back of your neck?
Listen, listen, coach.
Coach, listen.
You're sweating it over nothing.
The game is a lock.
We found out that the SCU starting quarterback came down with the Canadian flu.
The Canadian flu?
What the hell is that?
I guess it's just like the American flu, just colder.
Hogwash.
Every year SCU tries to put out some bogus rumor about one of its star players.
Mess up our game plan.
Last year, their kicker had rickets.
Jazz, you fed me a bad tip, man.
I might owe your bookie $500 that I don't have.
Tony the Shovel ain't gonna like that.
Just ask Flat Nose Gary.
The Birdman is our team's lucky charm.
Without him, our players won't think they can win.
And, if they don't have it here, they ain't gonna to have it here.
And if they don't have it here, you gonna get it there.
Jazz, Jazz, come here, come here.
I know where this is.
This is the rumpus room of the Kappa Omega Psi sorority.
How you know that?
Well, I got me a little rumpus in that room the other night, you know.
Hey, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.
- I can't go there, man.
- Why not?
Restraining order.
It's a long story.
Thanks, but we'll just stick with our old system.
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Banks.
Well, we've got everything.
Except for the dog.
He seems to have chewed his way through the fence.
- What will we do if he comes back?
- Yeah, isn't he kind of dangerous?
Only if he hasn't eaten.
I don't know, maybe we should have given the new system a little more time.
Now, we live in a dangerous world and we should take precautions.
But turning our home into a bunker isn't the answer.
You're right.
Let's just get guns.
You're missing the whole point, sweetheart.
We are lucky enough to live in an area where we don't have to be obsessed with safety.
We missed Carlton's rally.
Let's not miss the big game, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on.
- I'm so excited.
It's gonna be - I know.
Is that?
My God!
Somebody stole my Mercedes.
You know, you are way too nice to be locked up in a cage.
- Does that mean you'll let me out?
- No.
But you're awfully cute when you grasp at false hope.
Look, I know you might find this hard to believe but in high school, I was sort of a Dweeb?
Well, I was going to say loner, but that too.
Now, for the first time, I'm actually part of a team.
Don't do this to me.
That was so moving.
Well, I'm late for the game.
Bye.
Amanda!
Never mind.
- Will, I'm so glad you're here.
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I knew you'd make it.
- Shut up.
- Come on.
- Damn.
Look, Will, I'm desperate.
Take off your pants.
I think you're taking this jail thing just a little too far, buddy.
Look, it's almost game time.
You're gonna have to go in my place.
If you think I'm putting on that stupid suit, you're out of your mind.
Well, if you don't, you're out 500 bucks.
Unzip me, please.
Gets a little funky in there too, huh?
Men, I know this is the first time we've been behind at the half.
But all we need is four quick touchdowns.
We'll be right back in this thing.
- He's here.
- Yeah!
Hey, it looks bad, Carlton, but now that you're here, we got a chance.
Do the peacock strut.
On your feet, boys.
Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher We are the Peacocks of ULA Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell are you doing?
That's not the peacock strut.
This is the peacock strut.
Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we What?
They rough you up or something?
Those animals.
Well, at least you're here, and that's all that counts.
Okay, gather around boys, it's time to rub the Birdman.
- Yeah!
- Y'all ain't rubbing nothing over here.
Hey!
Hey!
You.
Where's Carlton?
Hey, look, we tried to break him out, man, but it wasn't happening.
We're toast.
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.
Boo-hoo, our mascot ain't here.
You big bunch of babies.
What about your fans?
They got a lot riding on this game.
Their hopes, their dreams.
Their nose.
Hey, listen, I'm gonna tell y'all one time, and one time only.
Mascots do not win football games.
Players do.
And coaches.
Hey, you know what, you gentlemen got a choice.
You can give up and crawl away like spineless, gutless losers or you can pull it together.
Throw it down, pick it up, strap it on, kick it's butt and go out as champions!
Yeah!
This is the biggest game you will ever play.
Yeah!
Now, sure, some of you may make it to the pros but, let's be honest, for most of you this is the end of the line.
Ye!
No more big games, no more free rides.
No more honeys acting like you all that.
Let's be honest, we don't even know if half you all are gonna graduate.
- Then, what you gonna do?
Coach?
- Hey!
That's right, you guys, it doesn't matter what we do, we're losers.
Wait a minute, I didn't That ain't, that ain't Well, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay, okay, here's an idea.
Rub me, rub me, rub the bird.
Rub, rub Hey, Carlton, how'd you get out, man?
I escaped while the housekeeper was changing the newspaper.
Hey, fellas, I made it!
What did you do to them?
Listen Listen, Carlton, that is not important.
The most important thing is that you get out right there and you strut like you've never strat.
Peacocks We're something something field Peacocks pealed - No one's tougher - Right, right.
'Cause we are rougher - We are the Peacocks of ULA - Come on, come on, come on.
- Peacocks - Yeah!
We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher - We are the Peacocks of ULA - One more time!
Man, this victory party is weak.
That's because we lost, Jazz.
And thanks to you, I'm gonna have a date with Tony the Shovel.
Well, I hoped you learned your lesson about gambling.
Okay, Jazz, check it out, check it out.
Because you my homey, right?
I'll give you a five minute head start before I chase you down and drop kick your little coconut head.
Fair enough.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, Carlton, cheer up, man, we only lost by one point.
You know, that was a hell of a comeback.
Man, you should be proud as a peacock.
We played a good game.
I'm just thinking about someone.
- Amanda?
- Yeah.
I'll probably never see her again.
I'll bet you $500 you'll see her again.
You're on, mister.
Carlton?
Amanda, does this mean what I think it means?
Yes, Carlton, I've come to gloat.
We won.
Well, bye.
Wait a minute, that's it?
I thought we had something special.
Dear Carlton, it would never work between us.
You're a Peacock, I'm a Mustang.
Can you imagine what our children would be like?
What, powerful hind legs with a colorful tail?
Then I guess this is goodbye.
Just until we graduate.
I'll wait for you.
And I'll cut back on dating.
Hey, Carlton.
Look, I know if two people like each other it shouldn't matter where they go to school, but the truth is it does.
Alas, fate has conspired to keep us apart.
That's beautiful, man.
I just want my $500.
He's a quick little sucker, isn't he?
And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
Only for you.
Give a little
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- I'm in.
- I call.
- Me too.
What you got, man?
- Oh, it's so pretty.
It's just so pretty.
If I had two sets of lips, I'd kiss myself.
Trump aces.
Well, it's 9:30.
Time to turn in.
The Peacock's catering a big party tomorrow night after Michelle Michaels' concert.
I suggest you get some shuteye, mister.
We'll be melon balling at 0600.
I can't believe you'll be hanging out with Michelle Michaels.
She is a goddess.
Please, she put her bra on one cup at a time just like everybody else.
I'd pay big money to see that.
Save your dough for Friday night.
What's Friday night?
There's people coming.
We're gonna watch the fight on Pay Per View.
Look, Will, I have better things to do with my Friday nights than sit around, watching some stupid boxing match on TV.
Well, you overlooked one small fact, Carlton.
- What's that?
- You weren't invited.
Whoa, now, hold it.
Now, don't think of this just as a backstage pass.
Think of it more as a merit badge.
What are you going to do to earn it?
You got to do something.
You know what I'm saying?
What's up?
What you gonna do?
Will, we have a crisis situation.
The glasses have spots on them.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you come to me sooner?
Hey.
Relax, squeeky.
It's just a dumb old party.
You don't look at the big picture, do you?
Today, Michelle Michaels, tomorrow, Gloria Estefan.
And then, dare I dream, Michael Bolton.
Lan, I didn't feel like anything was clicking tonight.
You sure the new songs are working?
Three words, babe, fabulous.
Am I right?
Look at that.
Everybody jumping.
People act so stupid when celebrities get around.
I need a reality check.
You, waiter.
- Come here.
- Me?
Yeah, you.
Miss Michaels wants to see me.
- Have you heard my new record?
- Oh, well, sure, baby, who hasn't?
- It's magic, isn't it?
- Right, sister.
Please.
Do you like it?
Well, you got some beats.
You do got some beats.
And you mix some lyrics with your beats, and you blended them.
- Be honest.
- I think it stinks.
I apologize, Miss Michaels.
He's from a foreign land.
Back to work, Vladimir.
Carlton Banks here.
I balled your melons.
Get out of here.
So is there anything you do like about my record?
Oh, yeah.
That cover is slamming, you know.
How long it take you to get all that honey off you, girl, you know?
You look all sticky and everything, you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just acting stupid, you know.
- Yeah.
- I'm just tripping.
I can't believe that I'm actually talking to Michelle Michaels.
And I can't believe I'm actually talking to Who are you?
Will Smith, of the Philadelphia Smiths.
So, honest Will.
Did you like the show?
I've been back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
All I heard was: I really didn't have it going on, but next time I'm gonna kick it and maybe you could be there.
- Yeah, I'm with that.
That's a good idea.
- Yeah.
I need to get back to work.
- See you later?
- Yeah.
All right.
You know, Miss Michaels, I thought your album stunk too.
She only wanted to know my opinion.
Will, I cannot believe Michelle Michaels actually spoke to you.
Hey, I checked her coat.
Really?
I wonder who'll play you in the movie of her life?
You know what, Will?
Maybe I'll get you Michelle Michaels' new CD for your birthday.
Oh, my goodness, that's right.
I do have a birthday coming up.
You know, it just totally slipped my mind.
Now, now, listen.
Nothing too fancy.
Something in a hatchback will do just fine.
You're impossible to surprise, so this year, we're not doing anything special.
Okay, we're all set.
Birthday reservations at Wolfgang Puck's new restaurant.
Hilary.
Oh, that's all right.
Don't worry about it.
Aunt Viv, you can still surprise me with that red sweater you hiding in the upstairs closet.
Wolfgang Puck, huh?
You were great.
He fell for it.
Now he'll never suspect we're giving him a surprise party.
We're giving him a surprise party?
I am proud to announce Miss Michelle Michaels.
Are you stalking me?
No, I just wanted to see you again.
It was so nice to talk to somebody other than a hysterical fan.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Michelle Michaels!
Your second song on your third album is so cool.
Who was Omar?
Is he your boyfriend?
- He is so fine.
You might never - Ashley, please.
Hilary Banks, TV weathergirl.
Pardon my little sister.
She doesn't know how to talk to celebrities.
So, Mich.
How about a song?
Oh, hello there.
I'm Philip Banks.
This is my wife, Vivian.
We're not hip, so we don't know your music.
It's nice to meet you anyway, though.
- Now, let's give them some privacy.
- Yes, come on.
- Come upstairs.
- It was nice meeting you, Michelle.
It's good to see you again, Michelle.
- Miss Michaels?
- Yes?
Don't think of me as just a manservant, think of me as a pleasure dome.
Thank you.
Thank you, G. Thank you very much.
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- No, they're sweet.
So do you wanna come to my concert tonight?
You can watch from backstage.
Oh, goodness.
See, tonight is dime-a-frame bowling night, you know.
Top scorer gets those cute little shoes and I just couldn't miss that.
I'll send a limo for you at 6.
Then, after the concert, she took me to this fly restaurant called Chez Pinette.
Chez Pinette?
Isn't that up near San Francisco?
Oh, did I forget to tell you-all?
She flew me up there in her private jet.
- What?
- Michelle has a private jet?
Listen, she got a private jet.
She has yacht.
Does she have a brother?
Well, I don't know.
I'll find out tonight.
We're going to the Golden Choice Music Awards.
They got us sitting between lke and Tina just in case something flare up.
Hey, y'all, don't wait up.
Hilary, is the coast clear?
No, there's gonna be patchy morning fog with limited visibility.
I meant is Will gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.
- Let's talk about this party.
Okay, Hilary, you are getting the DJ and I arranged for the caterer.
Why do I have to pay for a caterer if I have a butler?
Philip complains.
That only leaves the cake.
All set.
I ordered a Sunny the Seal ice-cream cake.
His sleek little body is made of chocolatey goodness and he balances a ball of tutti-frutti sherbet on his buttercream nose.
You are way too into this.
I guess at your age, birthdays are no longer a cause for celebration.
I'm giving up a hair appointment with Sergai to hang out with Will and his loser friends.
Will's friends are not losers.
Greetings, y'all.
Jazz, to what do we owe your presence?
My guess would be inbreeding.
I'm taking care of the entertainment for Will's party.
I've already shelled out for a DJ.
Perfect.
Now we have music for my stripper.
Oh, no, You are not bringing a naked woman into my house.
Oh, no.
You don't understand, Mrs. Banks.
She don't come in naked.
Where is Will?
He was supposed to be here at 7.
- That's it.
I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
Sergai keeps the salon open till 9.
I'm gonna see if he can squeeze my head in.
Mr. Banks, can I borrow 50 more bucks for Princess Lalet?
Otherwise, she gonna leave.
Let her go.
I've spent enough money on this party.
Here's 100 dollars.
No telling when Will will come back.
Well, he didn't leave a message on the answering machine.
Maybe that's him now.
Will.
You're an hour and a half late.
What, do you mean you can't make it?
Friends?
What friends?
So, birthday boy, you having fun?
This is the best birthday I ever had.
I always wanted to try skiing too.
- You did great.
- Well, yeah.
Except for that one run.
I'm just glad that the Saint Bernard didn't have to suffer.
Oh, I've been wanting to check this out over here.
- Hey, what does this button do?
- No, Will.
- It's the moon roof.
- Oh, and that's funny?
You think that?
Okay, no, no.
No, what are you doing?
Don't.
Come down.
Come inside, it's freezing out there.
- Come up, babe, it's great.
- There's no way.
You're crazy.
I said, come up here.
You ain't with me?
- No.
- Well, take that, then, girl.
- How's that?
- All right, that's it.
Oh, what you gonna do?
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
I'm frozen solid.
Really?
Well I was thinking maybe I could warm you up a little bit.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
You know, I just got caught up in the moment.
Oh, hell, yeah.
Greetings from Aspen.
Let me tell you, what a night.
You open up the hot tub and the neighbors come out.
You know what I'm saying?
I didn't even mind Bruce and Demi, you know.
I really didn't mind Arnold and Maria.
But Frank and Kathy Lee came over with that little dude Cody.
He made bubbles in the Jacuzzi without the jets on.
You know what I'm saying?
Nasty little dude, you know.
You have got a lot of nerve, Will.
Right, big guy?
Oh, yeah, right, right.
Will, this Maria Shriver full-figured gal?
- Philip?
Will We were throwing you a big surprise party.
Oh, you were?
I'm sorry.
I thought we was just gonna have dinner.
A cleverly orchestrated ruse, bub.
And to think, I laid out 50 big ones on your damn cake.
And not just any cake.
I got you that really neat one in the commercials.
The one that goes: Carlton.
All right, okay.
Look, I said I'm sorry, all right?
Well, look, I know somebody that wants to hear about my snowball fight with Denzel.
- Yo, Hil!
- Will, no!
- Yo, Hil!
- Will, no, no!
Don't go up there!
- Will.
- Ashley, what is wrong with you?
Will, I don't think Hilary wants to see you right now.
Why, what did I do to her?
You made her miss her appointment with Sergai.
She had to settle for his assistant.
So what?
Damn.
And I mean that in the nicest possible way, Hil.
I look like a troll doll.
Hilary, don't you think you're overreacting just a tad?
Sleep with one eye open.
Look, come on, guys.
Cut me some slack here.
Now, Uncle Phil.
Now, if you had a choice between an ordinary yet very thoughtful birthday party, and hitting the slopes with a superstar which one would you choose?
You mean, which superstar would I choose?
- Well, if I had to - Philip.
Will.
Michelle Michaels may not feel as serious about all this as you do.
Does that look like she's playing, Aunt Viv?
She gave it to me in Aspen.
Where are you going?
She's taking me to see the fight in Vegas.
What about the fight party you excluded me from?
You got the guys coming over to watch it on TV.
You know, I'm glad you reminded me, Carlton.
Listen, make sure they don't let you in, okay?
And there's the end of round one.
This is better than watching the fights with my Uncle Phil.
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
Hey, now, how could I not be enjoying myself?
I got Vegas, you, me a black dude and a white dude beating each other.
Life is good.
Here, let me grab us a little something here.
Michelle, I got to tell you ever since the barbecue at Wesley Snipes' crib I kind of been wanting to say something to you.
I haven't found a way to say it quite yet.
But this thing we got going on, I just feel real good about it, you know.
And I just Hey, hey, hey!
Hello, who is this?
!
Rick Benton.
We shot a swimsuit video in Tahiti.
- This is Will Smith.
- Guy?
Michelle, Michelle.
You know, you're even more alluring with your clothes on.
Isn't he the funniest male model you ever met?
Oh, wait a minute.
Now I recognize this dude.
I take it you've seen my calendar, huh?
Yeah, you were the April fool, right?
Look, guy, listen.
Michelle is a one-man woman now, all right?
- Oh, really?
- Yes, sir.
You might be able to tell by this ring she gave me.
It kind of reminds me of this one right here.
So are we all friends now?
Oh, yeah.
We found out we had a lot in common.
Look, black Fabio, listen.
Why don't you and your Motown-revival haircut go back to your seat shave your chest, shut up and just watch the fight.
- Will.
- What?
- Round 2.
- Are you squaring off on me, fool?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
Poor Rick.
He'll be in the hospital for weeks now.
How did I know he was gonna fall on Sinatra?
I think you overreacted.
What am I supposed to do with a dude putting his hands all over my woman?
Look, besides, he deserved it.
He stole one of your rings.
- Will, I gave him that ring.
- You did?
Yeah, I did.
I give out a lot of rings.
Well, I'm saying, this one you gave me is the last one though, right?
I just gave one to the paramedic.
I was wondering why he was taking your pulse.
Will.
You're so adorable.
But I think we need to take some time off.
You're right.
I'm gonna play slots.
I'll be back in an hour.
Will.
Sit.
It's been fun.
Excuse me, "been"?
I'm no good with relationships.
I thought you knew.
Don't you listen to my songs?
Well, yeah, I do.
Okay Why?
All right.
There's "Untouchable".
There's "Never Going To Settle".
There's "Wham Bam Goodbye".
Come on.
This isn't goodbye.
You only say goodbye to people you're never gonna see again.
This is more like see you later.
I'll see you later, Will.
Goodbye, Michelle.
- Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
- It was a hell of a fight last night, Will.
Yeah, champ ain't no joke, right?
I was referring to your bout.
They showed that on TV?
From the first shove to when Sinatra put his toupee back on.
There ain't gonna be no rematch.
When dude get out of the hospital, he can have her.
She dumped you, right?
Man, you crazy?
Yeah.
Well, it was a nice ride while it lasted, huh?
You know what, Uncle Phil?
I think I loved her.
Bull.
You hardly even knew her.
No, no.
Uncle Phil, I knew her.
You know what I'm saying?
I knew her.
You might have known her intimately.
But you didn't know her well.
Come on, face it, Will.
It was the lifestyle you're in love with.
Time out.
You trying to say that the only reason I loved her was because she was rich and let me sponge off of her?
Then I love you too, Uncle Phil.
I don't believe you guys did this.
We waited an hour and a half.
What's a couple more days?
- We even saved Sunny the Seal for you.
- Really, where?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
She still ain't show up yet, Carlton?
No, and I've been waiting over two hours.
Hey, look, man, don't even be beating yourself up like this.
- Everybody gets stood up once.
- Once a month?
Why did I ever trust a computer dating service?
Carlton, hey, hey, come on, man.
Look, chances are, a girl who matches up with you has already taken her own life.
Very funny.
I'll be back in the stockroom in the dark.
- Carlton.
- No.
I'm looking for Carlton Banks.
Just a second.
Just a second.
What took you so long, girl?
Damn.
Okay, so tell me again.
Once the bread is in those little slots, you just slide the lever down?
Fascinating, isn't it?
- Hilary - Not now, I'm learning how to cook.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.
Sweetheart, do you know what day it is today?
- Of course I do.
- So, what are we gonna do to celebrate?
Same thing we did last year, only better.
Gee, Uncle Phil, how are you gonna top last year?
Well - Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.
"Valentines fun for you and your lover come sing at the Peacock for a 10 dollar cover".
Neat, huh?
And I rented a karaoke machine and everything.
Gosh, for real?
Aunt Viv, can I be excused from the table?
I'm just too darned excited to eat.
But Mom, Dad, I've reserved special seats right next to the speakers for you.
Oh, thank you, son, but your father's got some special plans for us tonight.
You big romantic guy you.
Hilary, can you drive me and my date to the movies tonight?
Sorry, Ash, but I'm preparing dinner for my Valentine.
This is going to be a breeze.
Ashley, I'll give you a ride.
Oh, God.
Daddy, please, I don't wanna spoil your plans for tonight.
- I don't have anything special planned.
- What about our big evening?
Oh, that's much later.
- So who are we dating?
- Daddy, please.
This is not going to help my reputation.
What's wrong with your reputation?
You are.
You gave every date I had the third degree.
Boys will not even come near me at school without having a lawyer present.
Yes.
What is wrong with you, girl?
Will, daddy is going to drive me and my date to the movies tonight.
That doesn't sound like that's a big deal.
Will, the last time daddy drove me and my date to the movies he wound up sitting in the two seats behind us.
Couldn't you just drop us off and pick us up?
Oh, I'm afraid that's a little bit of a problem, Ashley.
See, this girl that I'm dating tonight is kind of like a 6.6 on the Richter scale so I wanna be there, you know, for all the aftershocks.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I'm doomed.
Ashley?
I've circled the movies I feel are appropriate for you and your friend.
Free Willy.
Beethoven 's 2nd?
- The Return of the Care Bears?
- Oh, that was my first choice.
Oh, but if your mother asks tomorrow I didn't get any extra butter on my popcorn.
Oh, whoa, hey, hey.
Uncle Phil, check it out.
There's been a slight change of plans.
Ashley is gonna double with me and my girl.
I'm not gonna have my daughter involved in one of your wild evenings.
We playing miniature golf.
That'll be cool unless the church group shut that place down, you know?
- And afterwards?
- Well, I was thinking we'd run some guns to Nicaragua but we'll probably just come home.
All right, Will.
She's in your hands.
But if anything happens to her, those hands will be without fingers.
Yes, sir.
Lose my fingers, sir.
Hi, good evening, everyone, and welcome to rocking Valentine's Eve.
Now I know, most of you are wondering two things: "How does he dress so well"?
and " What is this thing called karaoke anyway"?
Actually, karaoke has two definitions.
Carry, as in carry a tune and oke, as in okey-dokey, let the good times roll.
I swear, I made that reservation a week ago.
Philip, why don't you be a man and admit that you forgot Valentine's Day.
All right.
I admit, I just forgot.
How come you don't forget Thanksgiving?
Why don't you just relax and try to enjoy your son's party?
Look who just floated in on cloud nine, Philip and Vivian Banks two people, who, over the years, never stopped loving each other.
I should know, my room was just down the hall.
- Let's get out of here.
- Just Hey, there, funny Valentines.
How about a love song?
We're here live at the St. Valentine's Day Open where Samantha Sackin is about to attempt a very difficult stroke.
Wait a minute, it looks as though she's getting some help from her caddy.
Will, I thought you were the announcer.
Hush up, I'm trying to help you with your form.
- Stop, not in front of your cousin.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Come on, let's go out to the car.
- Stop.
- They are really sweet together.
- What do you think he's saying to her?
Probably the same thing you were saying to girls when you were his age.
I doubt it.
When I was his age, I was trying to get the girls to No, no.
He's just a little kid and so is Ashley.
Not so little, Will.
She is a beautiful girl.
Didn't you see what the putter guy did?
- No, what did he do?
- He dropped her ball on purpose.
Now, why would he do that, unless he was trying to check out her?
No, look, that is not possible.
Hey, when I was 15, it was possible.
Yeah, but you was a little freak though.
No, I'm just saying things were a lot faster in them public high schools.
She goes to Bel-Air Academy.
I went to St. John's Parochial.
You still got that little dress and them shoes?
Hey, Carl Lewis, put a move on it.
Hey, take it easy, Pops, you'll be in a hole soon enough.
That's a really nice outfit.
Hey, look, if I make this putt, you got to promise me that you'll Oh, Will.
Bryan.
You know, Geoffrey, just between you and me I was a little worried about making a whole dinner myself.
But there's really nothing to it.
Oh, Miss Hilary, could you pass me that heavy iron skillet over there?
Hello.
How thoughtless of me.
Oh, dear, I better go tend to Master Nicky.
What?
Geoffrey, you can't go now.
- But the baby needs me.
- He needs you?
I'm the one with orthopedist coming to dinner.
Geoffrey, I demand that you stay here and cook.
No.
Can you say that to me?
Well, let's try it again.
No.
By George, I've got it.
- No, no.
- Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey, you come back here!
- No, no.
Good God.
I think there's something wrong with the stove.
Hole in one, yes!
My first one ever.
That bird just doodied on your head.
Will, I got a hole in one.
Oh, you'll do better next time, baby.
Hey, hey, hey.
Check it out, listen.
I got a idea.
Hey, how about we switch partners.
You go down there and play with - Samantha.
- Thanks a lot, Ashley.
No, thanks, man, I like playing right here.
Okay, Ashley, you go down and play with What's-Her-Name.
- Will - Oh, you got another hole in one, baby?
You good.
- Gosh, it's getting warm out here.
- Why don't you take your jacket off?
Ashley, hey, check it out See It's some killer bees coming from Mexico.
And they could strike at any time.
And they love teenage flesh.
Thanks, but I'll risk it.
Just don't worry, man, I ain't gonna let no bees get to this honey.
Okay, Junior Mac, listen.
I think, it's time we had a little chat, mano a boyo.
Will, what are you doing?
Yeah, what's the problem?
I think, the problem is something called a double standard.
Well, wait, wait, hold up, baby, whose side you on?
I'm on the side that would like to continue our date.
And we would like to continue ours.
I thought we was all having a good time.
Don't you give me that innocent boy routine.
I know that routine I invented that routine.
I see right through you, you little dog.
Oh, shame.
Man, back off me, man.
I just wanna have some fun.
Fun?
Does this look like a place to have fun?
I don't think so.
Ain't nobody gonna have no fun up in here.
- Not me, not you, not her - And definitely not me.
Goodbye, Will.
Whoa, baby, come back here What is her name?
The word was out on your father but who knew your whole family was crazy?
Bryan, I'm so sorry.
Ashley, if you ever run away from home, give me a call.
- Bryan, wait - Hey, let him go.
Let him go, baby.
And good riddance, you little Filthy McNasty.
Will, how could you do this to me?
To you?
Ashley, I'm doing this for you.
When you get older, you'll understand.
Look, let me make it better.
I'm gonna buy you some ice cream.
No, I don't want anything.
You're worse than daddy.
Nice job, Cupid.
Ashley!
That's what I call a happy Valentine's Day.
Ashley!
Why does everyone treat me like I'm some defenseless little girl?
Because you are, Ashley.
I mean, boys is just gonna try to take advantage of you.
That's my problem.
Not yours or my father's.
And you know what?
I can handle it.
Yeah, right, like you can handle some big old dude trying to be all over you like cheese on a Big Mac.
Will, maybe I like cheese.
How you gonna like something you ain't never had?
Please tell me you ain't never had no cheese, Ashley.
No, but if I wanna have sex, I do not need your approval.
It's cheese, Ashley.
What you all looking at?
Excuse us.
Look at me.
I'm not the 11-year-old I was when you first moved to Bel-Air.
Do you understand?
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Maybe we need to send you to an all-girls school, you know.
Just so you keep your head on your studies.
Ash Ashley.
Okay, that's twice.
Ashley, Ashley, come back here.
Come I ain't playing, girl.
Come back here!
And what are you looking at?
Well, can you fix it or not?
Lady, this thing needs a whole new mess of parts.
I'll have to come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Don't you have, like, a spare stove in your truck?
I took it out when I put in the hot tub.
Listen, you Duane.
I happen to have an orthopedist coming to dinner.
It's Valentine's Day.
Or wasn't there a sign or something in the trailer park?
Listen, you.
The stove has to wait until tomorrow.
But while I'm here, maybe I can adjust your attitude.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Don.
You what?
Yeah, I understand.
Sure.
Bye.
Problem?
My date got called to the emergency room.
Some old lady fractured her hip and broke her leg in five places.
Do I have the worst luck or what?
You're not the only person who had things to do.
I was supposed to go out clubbing with the Maytag repairman.
He don't get out much, you know.
That a smile?
Was that a smile that I just saw?
Oh, it looks really nice on you too.
You know what?
As long as neither of us are doing anything why don't we not do it together?
Oh, well, that's very sweet, but how can I put this nicely?
I'm too good for you.
I usually don't say this to a woman, but you know what?
You're probably right.
Happy Valentine's Day, pretty lady.
Duane?
Do you fix microwaves?
Can we go now, please?
No, I don't want this evening to ever end.
Stop it, Vivian.
You don't wanna be here any more than I do.
You're right, I would rather be in a romantic, beautiful restaurant having a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner.
But you didn't remember.
Look, sweetheart, sweetheart, you know Come on, everyone, hum with me.
Sweetheart, I work very hard to provide a good life for you and my family.
And every night, I hold you in my arms, I kiss you goodnight.
I don't need a holiday to tell you that I love you.
I show you all year.
Oh, Philip.
We're going to Paris on our anniversary.
Philip.
Oh, that's next week.
It is?
- Ashley?
- Oh, great.
I just paid a 10 dollar cover to spend Valentine's Day with my parents.
- Where is Will?
- I don't know and I don't care.
- How did you get here?
- I took a bus.
You what?
- You got a lot of explaining to do.
- So do you, Will.
You let this child wander the street at night.
I'm not a child.
You were supposed to watch out for her.
I did.
That's why I kicked that old nasty boyfriend's butt out.
- Daddy - Just a minute.
- What did he do to my little girl?
- I'm not a little girl.
Hey, a little less yelling and shouting, a little more humming and clapping.
- Look, all I know is - Where is the girl?
We was at the Putt Putt Golf and she was necking.
Who was necking?
- All I know, is I'm dating her - You know you had a responsibility.
Five, four, three, two.
We're here live at the St. Valentine's Day Open where Samantha Sackin is about to attempt a very difficult stroke.
Oh, wait, it looks like she's getting help from her caddy.
- Hold, please, hold.
- Ti, you can't walk through the shot.
Did I?
Oh, my God.
Jeez.
You little Filthy McNasty.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Now, look, Uncle Phil, we don't need nothing too fancy as long as it's got vibrating bucket seats a refrigerated glove compartment and a license plate that say: Will, this car is for basic transportation, not your indulgences.
That's right, big guy.
We want something that emphasizes good sense over style and excitement.
How about a '94 you?
- There it is.
- Oh, okay.
Ta-da!
The all new Accountant BX.
It has the latest technology in childproof door locks.
What are the honeys gonna say about a dude cruising around in one of these?
They'll say, " Why, there goes a thrifty, level-headed young man".
Yeah, right before they say, "And I'll never have sex with him".
Afternoon, gentlemen.
- Philip Banks.
- Pete Fletcher.
I'll be right with you.
Thanks, I think we found what we're looking for.
Oh, good.
I like a man who knows what he wants.
Makes my job a whole lot easier.
Uncle Phil, you not seriously considering making me drive this Carltonmobile, are you?
Son, when I was in college, I drove a manure-brown '65 Dodge Dart.
So why you taking that out on me?
What a piece of junk.
Tow trucks used to follow me around like vultures.
You deserve better, Uncle Phil.
- Perhaps.
- Don't listen to him, Dad.
It's a trick.
Check this out, Uncle Phil.
You like that, right?
There you are, Uncle Phil, thousands of pounds thinner cruising the strip at Princeton.
Wind blowing through your big old fro.
Honeys checking you out.
They're saying: "There go Philip Banks, he is a bad mamma jamma".
They waving at you, Uncle Phil.
Go ahead, go ahead, wave back.
It's okay, wave back.
Go ahead.
Right on, sisters.
Dad, did I mention that the all-new Accountant gets 75 miles to the gallon?
To hell with the Accountant, I want this.
Excellent choice, Mr. Banks.
Come on in the office, we'll crunch some numbers.
All right.
Dad, Will just bamboozled you.
And that's the story we'll tell your mother.
Thanks, Will.
You bought a great car, Mr. Banks.
- Thanks for your business.
- No, no, thank you.
- Carlton.
- Someday.
- Will.
- Oh, yes, sir?
I believe this is yours.
Yo, a grand?
Yeah, well, that's the standard commission for an Evader.
Oh, I forgot something.
What?
Another zero?
Hey, hey.
Well, I can only pay commission to someone who works for me.
Interested?
That sounds great, man.
I can't fade that, I'm still in school.
Well, good for you.
Forget I mentioned it.
What does a college kid need with cash like this anyway?
Hey, hey, hey.
What you talking about?
Will, I believe you have the makings of a super salesman, and together we can make piles of money.
Of course, my pile would be bigger.
- How about Saturdays?
- Saturdays?
I tell you, throw a CD changer in my uncle's Evader, you got a deal.
- Done.
How about Sundays?
- You gotta give me some wire wheels.
- Holidays?
- Got to give a brother cellular for that.
"As you become more comfortable as a salesman you'll develop your own style".
Say, baby, with all that butt, you might be needing a hatchback.
I'm gonna be so rich.
- Hi, Will.
- Oh, hey.
Hil, you mind if I kick my sales rap on you?
Pretend you're buying a car.
No offense, Will, but I would never buy a car from you.
Hil, we're pretending here.
You're not my cousin, you're somebody else.
Oh, I get it.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Will Smith.
And I'm the Baroness Natasha.
I am on holiday in your country with my husband, the baron, and my lover Gustav.
Okay, look, baroness, I was wondering if I could interest you in a sporty new Evader?
- It has a V6 dual overhead - Yes, of course, I take six.
Gustav, pay the man.
You take jewels, yes?
Hey, thanks a lot, Hil.
My pleasure.
Well, I'm off.
You most certainly are.
Look, G, I was wondering if my sales Peasant!
Hey, can I kick my sales rap around with you?
Later.
Your Aunt Viv and I are going for a ride in Daddy's new toy.
- What is that?
- This is cruising music.
Al Green and the Isley Brothers.
- Sookie, sookie, now.
- Baby.
- Come in.
- Hey, hey.
Will, Will, Will.
Man, congratulations.
Five cars in one day.
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, yes, I have.
Me.
Look, I'm telling you, boss, it is the best feeling in the world.
Well, there's a close second.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, there'll be plenty of time for that.
Now, if you feel good now, take a look at your commission check.
I'm sorry, are my pants wet?
How many of your friends can say they made that kind of money in one day?
What you mean, legally?
But it's a shame.
Tomorrow, when you're in some chemistry class learning about inert gases, someone will be stealing your commissions.
- Now, that's where you're wrong.
- That's the spirit.
I don't take chemistry, but I damn sure know math.
So you can figure what a full-time check would be?
Yes, sir.
Five times this, carry the six, and add a zero.
- And what do you get?
- I get out of school.
Shake hands with your new full-time man.
Whoomp, there it is.
Isn't this great?
Family fun and no Will.
- Your turn, son.
- Okay, to me.
"You're in a store and you find $50 on the ground.
Do you pick it up"?
Of course not.
Geoffrey picks it up.
- Your turn, Ash.
- Oh, okay, Daddy.
"It's clear your teenage daughter is not enjoying the tedious board game being played in a forced family-bonding moment.
What do you do"?
Fine.
I try to encourage family time together, and this is the thanks I get.
If you don't wanna play, you don't have to.
- Go on, get out of here!
- Philip.
That's what it says on the card.
Well, I'd ask if there was something else she'd rather do and discuss an alternative.
- Good answer, baby.
- Oh, I bet you feel like a big dummy.
Hey, hey, hey.
Yo, I tore up that sales chart today.
Well, congratulations, Will.
If you find something that excites you, hold on to it.
That's what gets me through the day.
So, Uncle Phil, what you're saying is that if a guy finds a job that he likes, he should give it his all.
Absolutely.
- Then I'm doing the right thing.
- Of course you are.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking I'm gonna quit school and sell cars full-time.
Boy, have you lost your damn mind?
There is no way you're gonna quit school as long as I'm here.
Aunt Viv, it's not like I'm working fries in some burger joint.
Look, I'm in a suit and a tie and I'm selling fine cars.
That's right.
College isn't for everyone, and if Will is happy I think we should all be happy for him.
That's right.
Hey, thanks a lot, Ash.
Listen, I get my license in a few months.
You think you could hook me up?
Ashley, go to your room.
- Cherry red.
- I got you.
- You know.
- I got you, go ahead.
Your mother sent you here so you could have a bright future.
You quit school, you're throwing it all away.
- I won't allow that.
- See, now, that's not fair.
Hilary dropped out of school and turned out great.
Hilary's success is contrary to the laws of nature.
Totally inexplicable.
Oh, stop.
- Look, that was a bad example.
- Will, I think it's stupid - Stupid?
It's not stupid.
- Hey.
Hey!
Could we talk to Will in private, please?
It's idiotic.
Look, Uncle Phil, you go to college to figure out what you wanna do.
I mean, I found what I wanna do, and it ain't taking me no four years.
Going to college is not about finding a job.
It's also about finding yourself.
And the search should take more than one weekend.
Why can't you guys respect my decisions and treat me like an adult?
Okay, fine.
I'm telling your mother.
Oh, Aunt Viv.
Look, Uncle Phil, I got to do this, man.
All right, Will.
Hey, come on, man, it's not the end of the world.
Yes, it is.
If I'd waited a few days, I could have bought that car from you wholesale.
- Yo, what up, J?
- Yo.
I need to ask you a favor.
I need a car with a back seat.
Jazz, I can't just give you a car to take off the lot, man.
Who said anything about leaving the lot?
This will do just fine.
Get out.
Get out!
Come on, Ophelia.
That's all right, I have a real friend at the bus depot.
Well, this is impressive, man.
Twelve units in your first week.
You realize I have people on my staff who don't sell 12 cars in a year?
Well, they in the wrong business.
So you think I should fire Harrison, do you?
- I didn't say that.
- Well, you're wrong.
- Good.
- You should fire him.
- What?
Me?
- Yes.
Because I think you're excellent management material.
Here, sit down.
Put your feet up.
Good.
See?
Looks good on you.
Yeah.
Feels nice on my butt too.
Imported cigar?
- Lf that's all you got.
- Yeah.
Bite the end off.
I'm not too sure about this firing thing, man.
Will, Harrison's been sliding downhill for years.
His sales record is embarrassing.
Especially when compared to a mover like you.
Go ahead, put him out of his misery.
It's the only humane thing to do.
This chair is made out of leather, isn't it?
All right, all right.
Say, Harrison, you got a second, man?
Sure, I'm just doing some paperwork.
You know, some nights I can barely tear myself away from this desk.
Maybe you can take it with you.
- Look, Harrison - Don't get me wrong.
Did you know I have six kids?
No, I didn't know that.
Hey.
You know, I bet you'd love to spend more time with them, wouldn't you?
Sure, especially since Mary died.
I'll be right back.
Yo, man, did you know Harrison has six kids and a dead wife?
Of course I know.
He's my brother.
- See, now, that's cold, man.
- No, Will, that's business.
When you're the manager, you make the tough decisions.
I don't know, man.
Firing people ain't fun.
It's an acquired taste.
You'll learn it.
I have faith in you.
I don't know, man.
That's it, you're out of here, come on.
Don't be eyeballing me neither.
Get on, come on.
Get on!
And wash those shirts.
Especially you.
That's three less mechanics to worry about.
Great.
Tomorrow, we hit the parts department.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll buy you a steak.
All right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man, you missed a spot.
You're fired!
Fired!
Now, look, the bottom line is, he wasn't producing.
Now, in this business, you either cut it or you don't.
And he didn't.
So y'all can take your bellyaching elsewhere because it's falling on deaf ears.
Get on out of here before I have to take my belt off.
Yo!
Oh, that's funny?
Y'all think that's funny?
What were my nieces and nephews doing here?
Yeah, they were coming to plead your brother Harrison's job.
I guess none of them good salesmen either, huh?
You're beginning to scare me.
Can I adopt you?
Hey, Pete, do you remember November 6, 1987?
How can I forget?
That's the day I set the sales record for the entire Southern California area.
I sold 11 cars.
Well, 10.
One of them had an exploding gas tank.
As far as I'm concerned, once they leave the showroom, it's a sale.
Well, that don't matter, because today I'm gonna sell 15.
Nobody can sell 15 cars.
- Will Smith can sell 15 cars.
- Oh, yeah?
Why don't you try your hand at that angry sister that just came in.
Yo, man, that's my mom.
So what?
A sale's a sale.
Hey, Ma.
Boy, where do you get off dropping out of school?
- Mrs. Smith, if I may interject - Who the hell are you?
Mom, this is my boss.
This is Mr. Fletcher.
So you're the snake that lured my boy from that fine institute of higher learning.
Mrs. Smith, your son has a bright and productive future here at Mulholland Motors.
Oh, really?
You ever been beat up by a woman?
Not without having paid for it.
Will, I'll be in my office hiding under the desk if you need me.
Now, Mom, listen.
For the first time in my life I found something that I'm good at and that I enjoy.
- It feels good, Mom.
- Oh, yeah?
- Does this feel good?
- Mom.
- Which way is that college?
- Mom.
- Mom!
- Let's go.
This doesn't feel good, Mom.
My commission!
This fat-free cake isn't bad.
Sir, that's a sponge.
Well, I guess I'll start my homework now.
I got a lot of studying to do if I expect to make the best of this wonderful opportunity to get my college education!
Will, your mother's not here.
She went out to dinner with your Aunt Viv.
Oh, she better had.
Will, I'm sorry we had to involve her in this but you really left us no choice.
How in the world did she get the college to readmit you?
She threatened to enroll herself.
We're all glad you finally came to your senses.
You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
And being a car salesman didn't exactly bring out your most endearing qualities.
Uncle Phil, I was getting paid, man.
Will, what you do for a living should provide you with a sense of pride and personal fulfillment.
It should tap into that part of you that has something valuable to give to the world.
Shouldn't be just about money.
- You really believe that, Uncle Phil?
- Yes, son, I do.
Then how do you explain being a lawyer?
I'm going to get another piece of sponge.
How in the world did she get the college to readmit you?
She threatened to enroll herself.
Well, we're all gla Well, we're all glad you came to your senses.
You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
And being a car salesman didn't exactly promote your * * * *.
It didn't promote?
Excuse me.
It's people from the Lord.
There's people of the Lord in the audience.
Well, it ain't like they ain't never used that word.
We sorry.
See See, James Avery See, he's a heathen.
- He's just a heathen.
- Amen.
He's a blasphemer.
Here we go.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey, my brother.
I just came back from the free clinic, and guess what I got?
What, man?
The phone number of those two nurses we met.
Yo, the twins that sleep in the same bed?
With some luck, we can put an end to that streak.
You the man.
Oh, hey, Phillipe, I need you to cover my next shift.
Actually, cover my next three shifts.
You know how demanding twins can be.
Yes, my brother, it's gonna be some night.
Oh, wait.
I just remembered, I can't go.
- Well, why not?
- I'm getting married.
What do you mean, you're getting married?
Her name is Jewel Robertson.
I saw her on Cops, getting busted for grand theft auto.
Jazz, the woman's a convict?
We prefer the term "freedom impaired".
How about the term "not playing with a full cell block"?
You don't understand, man.
Jewel makes my life complete.
See, I know you look at me and you say, "Damn, that Jazz has it all".
But the truth is, behind these shades, there's a big, empty hole.
Well, that's for damn sure.
And I was gonna make you my best man.
Oh, really?
Your best man?
Well, you are my best friend.
My other friends pretend to like me for my money.
That's because you owe it to them.
The ceremony's at the Woman's Correctional Institution next Tuesday.
Whoa, Jazz.
You're getting married at the prison?
Why not.
It's free.
We follow an execution.
Jazz, ain't no homey of mine getting married up in no prison.
Well, unless you got a rich uncle or something, that's how it's got to be.
There she is, Jewel Robertson, number 54820 out of Folsom Prison.
Crime, grand theft auto.
Time served, two years.
Let's take a look at the videotape.
Officer down.
Officer down.
We need backup.
Get her off of me.
She's biting my Has Jazz lost his mind?
I mean, woof.
What's wrong with her face?
Sweetheart, it's electronically scrambled.
Whatever.
I just hope she's not toying with Jazz's emotions.
I hate to see a sweet guy like that get hurt.
Honey, up till today, you've never had a nice thing to say about Jazz.
Up till today, Jazz was available.
Now that he's getting married well, forbidden fruit always looks more tempting, doesn't it?
Mother, for God's sake, he's half your age.
Well, I'm happy for Jazz.
I think it is so romantic.
- I give it three weeks.
- The marriage or her parole?
Yo, whoa, hey, that's not funny.
Jazz is my best friend.
Was.
Be prepared, Will.
Marriage brings about new priorities.
You may find Jazz has less time to spend with you once he's taken a wife.
Please, ain't no way Jazz, knowing me, gonna let some honey come between us.
That's what I thought too.
When I married Vivian, I lost all my friends.
Right, honey?
But, you know But it wasn't like I was gonna need them.
After all, I wasn't gonna have any fun anymore.
Honey.
Sweetheart.
Babe Man, Uncle Phil, I knew you had a man-size appetite, but both feet?
Don't worry, Daddy, I'll run damage control.
Thank you, baby.
Hey, well, look, I don't even care.
Jazz is in love and I'm gonna make sure that he has the best wedding ever.
Even if I got to pay for it myself.
I mean, even though I am just a poor black man trying to get my education.
Forget it, Will.
I am not shelling out for Jazz's wedding.
Oh, please.
Now, I seem to remember a rather large relative of mine saying that: "If Jazz would just find some bimbo to get his mind off of Hilary I'd be more than happy to pay for the wedding".
Well Way to go, Judge Banks.
You pretend to uphold the law but you'll renege on a verbal contract?
Well Well, she is a convict.
I could call it a rehabilitation party and write it off.
Check it out, you're a judge.
You can perform the ceremony.
Pay yourself 25 bucks.
- Fifty.
- Pay yourself 100.
It's your money.
That's right.
I finally found the man of my dreams.
Marry me, Carlton.
Very funny, Will.
But while you're playing with dolls, I'll be securing the premises.
I mean, we are gonna have a convict in the house.
Jazz, would you relax, man.
Can't help myself, Will.
Not with Jewel due any minute.
Oh, is she pregnant too?
Of course not.
I have the deepest respect for her, Mr. Banks.
She's a class act.
Somebody wants to know where the bride is registered.
Gillespie Liquors.
She's here.
She's here.
She's here.
Carlton.
I also put my diamond cuff links in a balloon and swallowed them.
That's more than I ever wanted to know about you, Carlton.
Okay, everybody just relax.
Well, hi there, Mr. Man.
You like my dress?
Hilary, will you get out of my way?
You're blocking my view.
Miss Jewel Robertson.
- Jazzy!
- Munchkin!
There's a lot to be said for a woman who's been in prison a long time.
Hey.
Yo.
Hello in there.
Munchkin, these are the lovely people who have opened their home and their wallet to us.
Hey, I'm Will, the best man.
Oh, yeah?
As far as I can see, this here's the best man.
I love this bony butt.
And it loves you too, my pet.
Carlton Banks here.
I suppose you noticed our fine collection of European autos in our driveway.
I also noticed you have a very small head.
Hey.
Don't mind him.
We are very happy to have you in our home.
Thanks, and I guess it's true what they say: - Can't buy good taste.
- Hey.
Which one is the desperately stuck-up, self-centered clothes horse?
Guilty.
- Now, just a minute, young lady.
- I'm sorry.
See, the prison therapist says that I should say what's on my mind and not keep too much bottled up, otherwise I'd you know, go out and do something stupid like hotwiring a Lexus.
Although it did get me on prime time.
And kept you in the hearts of viewers everywhere.
I just wanna say, if you ever hurt him I'll hunt you down like the dog that you are, and kill you.
Well, gotta go shop for your present.
Beautiful and nuts.
- You must be very proud.
- I guess.
Well, hey, look, I've got an idea.
Jazz, why don't you take Jewel into the kitchen and get her some grub.
That's if tubby here hasn't eaten it all.
Come in.
Just trying on my wedding dress.
Hey, Jewel, I just wanted to come and check to see if there's anything you needed.
You know, a cup of coffee, a blood test.
Actually, I thought I'd see if you could live up to your title.
You know, best man.
- Oh, what did you have in mind?
- Could you help me with this?
It's already zipped up.
I know.
I want you to zip it down.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Listen, my cousin Hilary is right down the hall.
- I'm gonna get her.
- Quit messing around.
Come on, I gotta take a shower and do my hair.
Now, hurry up.
You know if somebody was to walk in here right now they might think you was hitting on me.
Trust me, if I was hitting on you, you'd know it.
Really?
How?
Okay, you made your point.
Uncle Phil, you busy?
What's on your mind, Will?
Jewel kissed me.
- It's customary to kiss the bride.
- No, no, no.
Uncle Phil, this was like one of them Fatal Attraction elevator-scene kisses.
You know what I'm saying?
You know?
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating, Will.
Listen, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you.
I went up to the room to see if she needed anything.
She kissed me on my lips.
She jumped on me and she was stuck on me.
And I was trying to shake her off, but I couldn't.
She was like a little naked Velcro midget.
What am I gonna do, Uncle Phil?
Guess you've only got two choices.
You can either tell Jazz or not.
And you're a judge, right?
Look, maybe this story will help you.
You know, when I was younger, I was a pretty sexy guy.
If you're not gonna take this seriously, Uncle Phil Do you wanna hear this story?
Okay.
I was driving home from a party with my buddy and his girlfriend and my buddy fell asleep.
Next thing I know, she leans across and fastens my seat belt.
You know what I'm saying?
Please don't do that, Uncle Phil.
Sorry.
Anyway, I figured that our friendship was strong enough to stand the truth.
So we went out for a beer and I told him everything.
Well, did he thank you?
Oh, yeah.
With a bar stool, on the head.
Well, I mean, Jazz ain't the violent type I don't think.
Well, the point is, to be a good friend, you have to risk losing a good friend.
- I think I know what I gotta do.
- What's that?
I gotta find somebody else to talk to about this.
Hey, Jazz.
How's it going, man?
How's it going?
This is the best day of my life.
Did I thank you for everything you've done?
Well, not everything.
I hope you two will be close.
She touched me, Will.
And I know she'll touch you too.
Yeah, actually, Jazz, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
- See, listen, last night - She told you about our decision?
- What decision?
- The one we made last night.
We're gonna have 10 kids.
One for every month of the year.
But we gonna name them all after you.
Jazz, hey, you ain't got to do that, man.
Okay, then, we'll name them Earl.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's cool, Jazz.
See, me and Jewel, we got this crazy dream.
We gonna keep our kids out of reform school.
- Listen, Jazz, what l - See, Will I don't know how long this happiness is gonna last.
If it's for just one day it's more than I've ever known before.
So, what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh, I just wanted to thank you for picking out these lovely yellow-and-green ensembles.
You're welcome.
Cell block 41 has arrived.
Welcome, ladies.
Please take a moment to sign our guest book.
And now, if I can just have your thumb.
You know, I resent being treated like a common thief.
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, what kind of cold-hearted, vicious, evil crime did you commit?
Securities fraud.
Really?
An inside trader?
So are you here alone?
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd all please take your seats.
And I wanna thank you for attending this wonderful occasion.
It's a pretty nice turnout, huh, Uncle Phil?
Are you kidding?
Jazz ain't got no friends.
I hired these people.
Ashley.
- Dearly beloved - Stop the wedding!
You can't marry her, Jazz.
We're not cousins, are we?
- Hilary, what's the meaning of this?
- I'm in love with him.
Oh, my God.
What am I saying?
I'm gonna go lie down.
May I continue?
We are gathered together to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
If there's anyone who knows why they should not be together let them speak now, or forever hold their peace.
Some friend you are.
I'm sorry, Jazzy, we can't get married.
- Munchkin.
- Jazz.
Freeze!
Munchkin, please.
What about all our guests?
And all the gifts?
I ain't never owned anything that still had the serial number on it.
- Jazzy, I'm sorry, it just wouldn't work.
- Will.
- See if you could talk to her.
- Jazz, I can't.
For little Earl's sake.
Listen, Jewel, you cannot do this to Jazz.
Marry him.
Okay, you guys can just leave the state and put me behind you.
- Will, I can't.
- You have to.
No, really, I can't, I'm on parole, I'm not allowed to leave the state.
Damn these good looks of mine.
Listen, now, Jewel I know it's hard, okay?
But you got to look beyond this charming, sexy exterior, okay?
You got to see the real Will Smith.
I'm irresponsible, I'm unreliable, I'm immature.
- Egotistical, self-centered.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.
- Conceited, thick-headed, spoiled.
- Okay, that's fine.
And on top of that, you ain't even that good-looking.
Then why you want me so bad?
I don't want you.
I only came on to you because I figured you'd tell Jazz and he'd call the whole thing off.
But you couldn't even do that.
I kissed you for nothing.
Well, damn.
Will, I've never met anybody who cares for me as much as Jazz does.
You know, whenever we go to a nice restaurant, he carries my tray.
And when it's time to skip out on the check he always holds open the bathroom window for me.
Well, that's Jazz for you.
Can't you see?
I don't deserve a man like him.
I mean, look what he's done for me.
Beautiful wedding gown getting married in a Bel-Air mansion.
Do you know where my mama was married?
No, where?
I don't know.
I was hoping you did.
Jewel, believe me when I tell you, you and Jazz are made for each other.
Listen, trust me, I've known Jazz a long time and you are the best thing to ever happen to him.
Will, I'm scared.
What if it doesn't work out?
- It will.
- But what if it doesn't?
It will.
- But what if it doesn't?
- It will!
Now get in there and marry that boy.
Thanks.
Okay, let's get a shot of the bridesmaids.
Okay, we're back.
We're back.
Everything's okay.
Bride just got a little nervous, but who wouldn't, marrying Jazz?
May I continue?
- Please do.
- Good.
The bride and groom have prepared their own vows.
Jazz.
You're one jewel I never wanna hock.
Sometimes I wanna bite you to see if you're really real.
If love was craps, you'd be a seven.
If it was on the first roll.
But if it was on the second roll, and the point was six, you'd be a six.
No, actually, you'd be a nine.
I'd play the field on the second roll, make a couple of extra bucks.
Then you'd be a six on the third roll, and then I'd clean up.
You know what I'm trying to say.
I love you, and you make me feel lucky.
And now, Jewel.
I love you, Jazzy, and I wanna be with you always.
Thank you for setting this little jailbird free body, mind and spirit.
Baby, I love you.
All right, all right, all right.
Do you, Jazz, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Oh, yeah.
Do you, Jewel, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Oh, yeah.
By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Okay.
Jewel.
Jewel.
Jewel.
Jewel, get off me.
Hey, Jewel.
I ain't playing.
Get off me, Jewel.
Get off of me, Jewel.
Okay, you made your point.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, Will, what's going on?
Lisa's coming over.
We're gonna watch a couple action-adventure flicks tonight.
Maybe if I get lucky we'll have a little action adventure of our own.
You know what I'm saying?
So, what movies did you rent, Casanova?
Oh, we got Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon 3 and my personal favorite, Maniac Cop VII.
Sounds like a romantic evening.
What's Lisa going to do?
Lookie here, lookie here, Spanky.
Now, I'm the man.
You see what I'm saying?
I'm the Man-dingo.
Lisa will watch what I tell her to watch and she will enjoy it.
And that, as they say, is that.
If you'll excuse me, it's about to get X-rated in here.
- You know what I mean?
- Hey!
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!
What's up girl?
So, what movies did you get?
Terms of Endearment, Fried Green Tomatoes and The Joy Luck Club.
Shall I get us some hankies?
What are you so happy about?
I just made the weekend reservations at Palm Springs for me and Lisa.
Lisa?
You've been seeing a lot of her lately.
Oh, yeah, and if it goes the way I plan I'll be seeing the rest of her this weekend, you know?
Have you no shame?
Yeah, I'm ashamed of you.
Well, while you're wallowing in your sordid filth of a life I'll be pursuing some culture.
I bought tickets to The Jeffersons live on stage.
It includes dinner with Sherman Hemsley and an autograph picture of both Lionels.
Swell.
That will go great with your Weezy collectible cups.
Hey, Kool-Aid!
I got your Kool-Aid, all right?
You look so good.
You are gonna be a hit at the Bahamas.
I can't wait to see your mother down there.
I've been practicing my limbo.
I don't know, Dad, that limbo bar gets as low as 13 inches.
Wow, Carlton, you could just walk right under.
Will's shacking up with some girl in Palm Springs.
You're gonna get it now, mister.
Have fun.
Wait.
Is that all you're gonna say to him?
Am I paying for your little trip?
- Well, no.
- Five up top.
All right.
Master William, Miss Lisa is here to see you.
Oh, sugar-wugar, now, come on, girl.
Oh, and sir, the limbo bar is set at three feet when you're ready.
Excellent.
He couldn't make that lying flat on his back.
Baby, now, say those words that you know send chills up my spine.
I want you to meet my father.
- What you talking about, girl?
- Well, baby, he and I are very close.
And before you and I get any closer I think that you should meet him.
That's cool.
I'll meet him when we come back from Palm Springs.
Oh, check it out.
I got us the Wilt Chamberlain suite.
With the electronic scoreboard over the bed and everything.
Well, before you and I get into a little one on one you're gonna have to talk to the head coach.
Well, I'm saying, what if he ain't playing off the same playbook I am?
Well, then we're gonna have to call a time-out.
Hey, hey, don't be using my analogy against me.
Come on, baby.
I'm just not gonna be comfortable going unless I know that my father approves of you.
As if there's anything not to approve of.
Oh, not the ears, baby.
All right, I'll talk to your daddy.
Keep doing that, we're gonna have to dig up his daddy, I'll talk to him too.
Do you have a non-profit book by African-American photographers?
You mean Songs of My People?
It's a very popular book.
Hey, hey, hey, we're not non-profit.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.
Hey, hi, hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing?
All right.
Sorry I'm late but after I left church, I went down and read some books to the elderly.
Don't overdo it, honey.
Will, this is my Dad.
- Daddy, this is Will.
- Hello.
How you doing?
Hear that deep voice?
Like James Earl Jones.
"This is CNN".
Well, I've got to get to class.
I want you guys to enjoy each other.
So how's the grub here, Wilbur?
Well, we've only had two food-related deaths in the past month.
I didn't read about that.
You must be doing a good job as a manager to keep something like that quiet.
Well, actually my cousin Carlton is the manager, you know.
I'm pretty much just Trying to score with my daughter.
- Sir?
- It's a joke.
I'm joking.
I'm pulling your leg.
You see these pictures?
That's my baby.
There's nothing in the world I won't do for her.
And I really respect that, sir.
And if you don't mind me saying so, that is a lovely picture of your wife.
I see where Lisa gets her good looks from.
That's not my wife.
That's my sister-in-law Cecilia.
She's so ugly, she'd make an onion cry.
Actually, I was being polite.
She is a dog.
Hey, hey, she's so ugly, she could make a freight train take a dirt road.
It'd be like: You talking about my family, boy?
Well, no, I just figured you You was so You know what, I like you.
- You do?
- Yeah.
But I'm out of time.
I've got to fly to San Francisco on some business.
Why don't we just finish this interview next week.
Hey, sir.
You know, I actually was hoping that I could get your approval by this weekend.
What's the rush?
No rush.
You know, I just hate to leave things unfinished, you know.
I'm very meticulous like that.
"Meticulous".
Hey, now that's a word you don't run into every day.
Say, why don't you fly to Frisco with me?
You can help me with my vocabulary.
- Fly?
- You ain't scared, are you?
Me, scared?
Hell, no.
Hey, Wilbur, you didn't finish your Buffalo wings.
I can't eat any more.
Sure you can.
Just put some hot sauce on there.
- No, thank you.
- Boy, what are you saying?
You better put some Red Rooster on there.
Look Hey, do you think you could just land the plane, you know and I'll just walk back to L.A. Oh, flying upside down makes you a little queasy, doesn't it, boy?
Well, no I'm not a I'll take that as a yes.
Now, let's talk about my daughter.
Look, it's like I told you on the ground, man, you know I just like being with her.
Wrong answer.
You might as well admit it, boy, you're like a squirrel trying to get a nut.
Let me ask you a question.
How many times did you put those rusty, crusty lips on my daughter?
With all due respect, sir, I think that's between me and Lisa.
Wrong again.
Okay, you win.
I'll just cancel our weekend in Palm Springs.
Why the hell would I want to go to Palm Springs with you?
Not you, Lisa.
You taking my baby girl to Palm Springs?
Oh, no, no, no.
- Boy, I'm really mad now.
- No, no, no.
The engine's dead.
What?
Yeah.
Oh, so I guess we're going down, huh?
Faster than a bucket of chicken at Oprah's.
Oh, so I should probably just confess all the nasty things I've done with your daughter, huh?
Especially seeing as how in any second now we're gonna be splattering all over those mountains there.
Let me tell you, I'm from Philly you've gotta wake up pretty early in the morning to get me with some old Mr. Adams?
Mr. Adams?
Mr. Adams?
I made it!
I'm alive!
- I can't believe it!
- I can't believe it either.
Your damn chute wasn't supposed to open.
Your plane wasn't supposed to crash neither.
I guess you just having an all-around bad day, huh?
How the hell you land so close to me?
I guess I'm just lucky.
Mayday.
Mayday!
This is Afro-Niner 423.
We've gone down.
Our precise position is somewhere over some trees and rocks and stuff.
- Give me that thing.
Give it here.
- What you gonna do, man?
- What you?
Don't - Give it.
Give it to me.
You done done it now!
Damn!
Okay, look, look.
We just got to get down from here, man.
Let me tell you what you gotta do, boy.
You gotta get your "mominimum" and knock me out of this tree.
Mominimum?
Don't you understand English, boy?
Mominimum.
Knock me out of this damn tree.
Come on!
All right, all right, here.
Get me over.
Get me All right, here we go.
All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm Philip Banks.
We got here soon as we could.
Have you found my nephew yet?
Good news.
We found the plane.
It's totaled.
What?
That's good news?
See, your nephew wasn't in it.
Well, where is he?
If I knew that, I'd be working for the Psychic Friends Network.
Look, that is my boyfriend and my father out there.
So you're gonna be twice as upset if they're dead, huh?
Now, you listen here, Mr. Park-Ranger- Psychic-Friends-Network-freak.
You get out there and find my cousin now!
Ashley.
Ashley, get over here.
Don't worry, we've got the best in modern equipment.
I'll send out a search party immediately.
Look, a party sounds like a lot of fun, but can we please find Will first?
Civilization!
Two backpacks and, look!
A broken radio.
All we got to do is stay here until these guys come back.
They are back.
They are?
Where?
Where?
This is our stuff!
Oh, I don't believe this.
We wasted four hours traveling around this stupid mountain.
Why don't you quit bellyaching and try to come up with some ideas of your own.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just do that.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right, the sun sets in the west, right?
Okay.
All right.
And moss only grows on the north side of the trees.
Stop spouting all that witchcraft.
All we got to do is just stay put.
I'm sure they're out there looking for me.
Not if they know you.
You know what, boy?
You've got a double order of lip.
And I got a short stack of patience.
What the hell does that mean?
Put up your hands.
I'm gonna give you a good butt-whipping.
Look.
Please, you're like And I ain't trying to be out here fighting no old man.
Oh, fine, that makes it easier for me.
- You all right, man?
You all right?
- Old man, huh?
I've got you now.
Oh, young blood.
Yeah, young blood.
- Get off me, man.
- Yeah, young blood.
What's that?
I don't know.
Coyote?
What do they eat?
One of those?
What is taking so long?
You have got to find my father.
Don't worry.
Ranger Franklin's our best tracker.
He never comes back empty-handed.
Oh, this is a tragedy.
Don't worry, Carlton.
I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?
I'm missing The Jeffersons live on stage.
Right now I bet George is calling somebody a jive turkey.
What are you complaining about?
This is hardly the way I wanted to spend my weekend.
Sitting around in some dusty old shack waiting for Will to show up.
Man, it's tough finding people in the woods.
- We'll try again in the morning.
- Well, no hurry.
Look, my nephew is a city boy.
I'm worried he might not survive in the woods.
- Oh, where's he from?
- West Philadelphia.
Oh, don't worry.
If he can survive there a couple of snakes and bears aren't gonna bother him.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm blowing on the embers.
You're blowing the fire out, man.
Look, relax, I got an idea.
What are you doing?
Just stand back, please.
What are you doing with my Red Rooster?
Damn!
And that was just the mild.
Man.
Look at those stars.
You don't see them like that back in the city.
Yeah, too much light.
You know, being out here in nature two guys against the elements it's like guys just naturally kind of bond with each other, you know?
You come together through a tough situation.
Actually start to like each other.
That ain't happening with us.
Not even a little.
Man, look at that moon.
Hey, what you know about some jazz, boy?
Oh, man, my grandma used to play Ella all the time.
Ella, Sarah, Thelonius, Miles, Bert.
Oh, man, those were the days.
Before the music died.
Hey, yeah, you can stop there.
The music ain't died.
Now, you got Guru, Diggable Planets, A Tribe Called Quest.
The defense rests.
No, I'm telling you, they got a nice blend of the old school with the new.
Lisa likes it.
Lisa listens to jazz?
Oh, man, we listen to jazz every time when we try to get in the mood Is that Orion the Hunter?
Look at that.
You know, Will, about Lisa sometime I am a little overprotective of her.
But she's my baby girl.
Heck, she's all I got now that I lost my plane.
I'm saying, I mean, I can dig that and everything.
- But don't you care what she wants?
- Nope.
Put some more hot sauce on the fire.
I'm gonna go on to bed.
I mean, I always found it so incredible that only I could prevent forest fires.
I mean, that's so much responsibility.
I really should be out there looking for your cousin.
Don't worry.
Will likes to sleep in.
- Will!
- Oh, thank God you're all right.
The pool house wouldn't have been the same without you.
Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.
There, I said it.
You happy?
Will, where's my father?
- Hey, it's all right, baby, he is fine.
- But what happened?
Well, you know, we had a little engine trouble and we went down.
But it was the best thing could have happened to us.
Yeah, we landed kind of in this wooded glade, you know near this bubbling brook.
Kind of looked like the beer commercials.
Except there wasn't no naked honeys.
There wasn't no beer.
Oh, but you know what?
I don't know if it was the beauty of the area or just being outdoors, but we kind of bonded.
Why didn't he come back with you?
Look, I could not tear him away.
I told him we could walk down this brook, take us back to civilization.
But he said, "No, you go on without me I wanna stay here and be at one with nature".
You can't be at one when you two.
- So I jetted.
- Really?
You know what?
I'm telling you, your father is a changed man.
He said we should go to Palm Springs and enjoy ourselves.
You mean he actually said that we could go?
He insisted.
Now that you're safe, I can still catch my flight to the Bahamas.
Come on, everybody, let's go, we're out of here.
Where's that boy with that firewood?
Wilbur!
Outside is a trail of hot sauce.
Light a match, take you right to him.
Wilbur!
Robin Hood, are you around here?
Anybody!
Red Rooster?
Anybody, give me a hand.
Squirrel!
I need Give me a piece of cheese, I'm hungry.
Little Red Riding Hood, where are you?
Wilbur!
Hey!
They leaving me out here by myself.
I'm scared.
We need some more people, come on in.
The Three Bears, where are you?
- Help me, somebody.
- John.
The show's over.
- Help me, please.
Where are you?
- John.
You can stay out here if you want.
Wilbur!
What the hell happened to everything?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
What's up, man?
- Hey.
Hey, what you looking at?
Just some pictures of me and Janice Robertson from back in the day.
Here we are on campus running from the National Guard.
Man, she is fine!
Tell me about it.
And you're sure that Aunt Viv is cool with your ex-girlfriend coming to visit, huh?
Oh well, actually, Janice was never officially my girlfriend.
Not that I didn't try.
Man, oh, man, did I try.
Flowers, poems, dinners.
I must have sprung for over 50 of them.
Well, maybe it would have worked if you had taken her too.
Sorry, it was just a little collegiate humor.
Oh, God.
You know what it's like to really go after a woman and never get her?
No.
Finally, after two years I realized that Janice wasn't gonna have me, so I settled for Vivian.
With Vivian.
With Vivian!
Sweetheart, that came out wrong.
Honey!
Honey?
Baby.
Geoffrey, prepare Mr. Banks' couch.
So, what time is Dad's old flame supposed to be here?
Carlton, she's not Daddy's old flame.
They weren't even intimate.
Uncle Phil discussed that with you?
No, I heard him say it in the hall after Mom slammed the door in his face.
Geoffrey, where's my purple tie?
It's in your tie drawer next to the Pringles.
Least that's better than the Kit Kat he keep with his drawers.
I have the greatest news.
You know Al Riggins the talk-show host?
- Yeah.
Well, he's in a coma and they want me to test as his replacement.
My horoscope was right.
This is my lucky day.
Hilary, aren't you even a little concerned?
Oh, I'm plenty concerned.
My competition is anchorwoman Mara Lopez.
And you know how they favor those minority people.
Maybe science can just come get her brain now.
Ashley, I need your help in the kitchen.
Geoffrey, will you set an extra place at the table.
Mr. Banks' friend is bringing her daughter.
Aunt Viv, I'm just curious.
Would this daughter be more of a playmate for baby Nicky, Ashley, or none of the above?
- She's 18.
- Good answer.
Men.
Hey, G, I gotta tell you, man.
If this girl is built anything like her mother I might have to check the premises, you know what I'm saying?
I might have to go see what the foundation is like, know what I mean?
Hold your permit, mister.
What makes you think the daughter's gonna opt for you when she can have me?
Well, number one, because I don't be saying stuff like "opt".
Number two, because Geoffrey still has to cut up your food.
Well, this hundred dollars says that she goes out with me first.
Okay, here's 50.
And another 50.
You're on and may the best man win: Me.
Might I get in on this?
Sure things don't come along every day.
On Master William.
Why would you pick him?
With all due respect, young sir I've seen you in action with women, and quite frankly, you're an idiot.
Fine, I got you both covered.
So how do I look?
Like a man asking for trouble.
Oh, nonsense.
Vivian and I had a long talk about this yesterday.
She is perfectly secure with Janice's coming to visit.
So, what happened to your nose, bro?
Oh, this?
- This?
- Well, l I cut myself shaving.
Oh, you were shaving your nose?
Okay.
Was that before or after you poured that bucket of cologne on your head?
You are reading way too much into this, Will.
This is just a little dinner with an old friend.
Oh, that's her.
Mrs. Robertson and her daughter, Wendy.
- Damn!
- Damn!
When my editor decided to do a story on post-earthquake syndrome I jumped at the chance.
I haven't seen Philip since the Princeton 10-year reunion.
Remember, we took over the registrar's office in '69?
Do I?
My eyes are still burning from the tear gas.
Wendy, your mother looked radiant even in a gas mask.
Oh, Phil, please stop.
Yes, Phil, please stop.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
So I'm at an anti-war rally getting ready to burn my draft card and Janice offers me a light.
I am so against war.
I mean, there's death and destruction and they preempt your favorite programs.
I remember during Desert Storm, trying to find Knots Landing Are those prunes?
Yes.
I have this theory about regularity.
Perhaps after dinner we can go for a drive and talk about it in depth.
I'm telling you, G, get down for another hundred.
I was thinking maybe we could take a walk on the beach find a little club, get our boogie on.
Oh, I love to dance.
Hey, I can dance better than Will any day.
Don't keep her out too late, Will.
She's in good hands, Mrs. Robertson.
I know she is.
I said I'll pay you when I get out!
I had a great time, Will.
Where'd you learn to dance like that?
Oh, the Arthur Murray Dance Studios.
- Tango?
- Okay.
So, what's up for tomorrow?
I'm seeing you again, I hope.
Who am I to crush a young woman's dreams?
Too bad your mom's in there.
Oh, we have separate rooms.
Well, then, where were we?
Will, I like you, but this is going a little too fast for me.
For real?
Here I thought I was taking it slow, you know?
No, no.
That That is absolutely, absolutely perfect.
- That's fine, that's fine.
- Okay.
Well, it was fun.
You have a good night, and I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night, Will.
- Good night.
Good night, baby.
Hey, Mrs. Robertson, how you doing?
- Will.
- I just dropped Wendy off.
Listen, she was begging me to come in.
I told her no.
I didn't think it was proper.
I am sure you're the perfect gentleman.
- Yes, ma'am.
Hey, good night.
- Will.
Would you mind sharing your earthquake recollections with me?
What, now?
Yes, I thought I might as well get started tonight.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'm just gonna go and freshen up.
Hey, this is This is a nice room you got here.
As far as rooms go.
So how would you describe the earthquake?
Well, you know, it was kind of like Shaq picked up the pool house and he was shaking it, you know, like them little snow globes.
You know, then Then I heard all this crying.
Was that baby Nicky?
No, no, baby Carlton.
He's not the most mature young man, is he?
Well, he's kind of like a 10-year-old trapped in a 12-year-old's body.
Well, good night.
But we've barely scratched the surface.
Listen Mrs. Robertson, I have to be honest.
I'm I'm, you know not really feeling right about being here with you in, you know that That thing.
Is there a problem?
Well, yeah, I mean when a woman changes into something more comfortable it usually means she wanna get more comfortable, you know.
And frankly, I'm a little uncomfortable with this higher level of comfort.
Will, I've put on a couple of pounds, and my dress was too tight.
There, you happy?
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was completely out of line.
Listen, my uncle has a fat problem.
I should be more sensitive.
You are so cute.
Would you like to see some pictures of Wendy in Saint-Tropez?
What?
Oh, yeah, pictures.
Yeah, pic Yeah, sure.
All right, easy.
This is This is nice.
This is Oh, this is This is nice.
Look how Look how blue this water is.
What's wrong?
There's a picture right there of you with no bathing suit top on!
It's Saint-Tropez.
Lots of women go topless.
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna run down to the lobby, get some of them free brochures, you know.
Before A free brochure.
Will.
You're not going anywhere.
Okay.
- Will?
- Oh, my God!
Uncle Phil!
- What are you doing sleeping out here?
- Vivian thought the couch was too good for me.
You just getting in?
Just because a guy comes in in the morning wearing the same thing he had on the night before that doesn't mean he slept with anybody.
Take it easy, I'm not accusing you of anything.
Maybe we parked and watched the sun come up.
- All right.
- Or maybe we sat in the lobby and we talked all night!
People do do that, you know!
I said I believe you!
Good!
Because l I ain't do nothing wrong.
Did you get to spend any time with Wendy's mother?
No, no, no.
They was in two separate rooms, and I wasn't in either one.
Before she leaves, try to spend time with her.
She has a lot to offer.
More than you know.
- What?
- I said I gotta go.
Well, well, well.
And where have you been all night, mister?
I'm sorry, I only answer to people over 5 feet.
You're over 5 feet, aren't you?
Oh, boy.
That was a lot of fun.
I sure love those old movies.
Oh, yeah.
Cleopatra Jones, the superbad sister.
Who do you think would win in a street fight?
Cleopatra Jones or Grace Jones?
Oh, see, now you're getting philosophical on me now, see.
See, now, Cleopatra Jones, see, she got that karate stuff, right?
She got some sweet moves on her.
Plus, she be packing heat.
But Grace Jones, she just scary.
- You've really been thinking about this.
- Yup.
Something else I've been thinking about too.
Am I intruding on anything?
Hey, Mrs. Robertson, hey.
What you doing here?
Well, your uncle invited me over for a little backyard barbecue.
Yeah, well, yeah.
We was about to go get our eat on too.
- Come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Oh, I love barbecue.
Help yourself, honey.
There's plenty of food.
Stop playing.
Well I think I'm gonna go get me some ribs, you know because, you know, my Uncle Phil likes to eat while he cooks and might not be nothing left for nobody else, you know what I'm saying?
Well, Will, I didn't expect to see you again so soon.
Listen, maybe I fell for you last night.
But I ain't never falling for you again.
Relax, Will, you think I want my daughter to find out?
How would it make me look?
Crazy.
Boy, Wendy deserves a lot better than Will.
When I think how we conned her into going out with him, it makes me sick.
At least I had some respect for her.
Carlton, you bet 200 dollars on her.
Hey, that's a very respectable bet.
Well, the secret to a successful cookout is flame control.
Remember the last barbecue we were at?
We were on the Jersey Shore protesting that toxic dump.
Oh, is that why that chicken tasted so funny?
We formed a human chain and kept the trucks out.
Oh, remember?
Of course I remember.
You were wearing that calico halter-top.
You know, I still have that halter-top.
Philip, the fire's getting a little too hot.
There, that's better.
Vivian, that was extremely childish.
Childish?
You are the one who is gawking over this woman in our own backyard.
She is an old friend.
You cannot fault me for being friendly.
Saint Bernards are friendly.
But even they don't slobber as much as you.
Vivian, this is such a beautiful home.
You are a very lucky woman.
Excuse me, I have to go check on our baby.
Something I said?
No, Vivian is just a little uncomfortable with our friendship even though I told her nothing ever happened between us.
You know, that was one of my biggest regrets.
Really?
I guess back then I just didn't appreciate the kind of man you are.
I would like to take you out to dinner tomorrow.
You know, we go back to New York the next day.
Oh, well Well, I appreciate that, but Vivian's busy tomorrow night.
Well then, how about just the two of us?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
Well, it'll be more business, you know, than pleasure.
You know, I need more insight on my article.
- I guess there's no harm in that.
- Oh, good.
Say 8:00 tomorrow?
My hotel?
Dinner?
Sounds fine.
Hey, Uncle Phil, hey.
Listen, can l?
Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
Will, I am cooking.
Yeah, your goose.
Can I see you in the Excuse us, Janice.
Uncle Phil, you cannot go to the hotel with that woman.
It's just for a little dinner.
Yeah, then dessert, the likes of which even you ain't never seen.
Can't you see?
Uncle Phil.
Janice is the one that got away, right?
Yeah.
Well, she ain't get away from me.
What?
Uncle Phil, I was dropping Wendy off back at the hotel, right?
Then I'm walking down the hall, and Mrs. Robertson comes up and she asking me about the quake, so I'm telling her and then she slips into something more comfortable.
Then she grab these pictures, she's showing pictures of San San-something, and then, you know, before I knew it, you know: You slept with Janice!
Ashley, go to your room.
Oh, I love this!
And take Carlton with you.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
You heard what I said.
Mother, is this true?
No, I can't believe you did this.
Oh, and you, Will, how could you?
Listen, listen.
Now I was I was just I was Earthquake and, you know, and then we And And then Have you ever seen your mother naked?
Will, you are just really a class act.
- But - Excuse me.
Oh, yeah, go blame it on me!
Janice, I think you'd better leave.
Vivian, this is not as big as you're making it out to be.
Maybe not in your little world.
Too bad, Philip.
We could have had something special.
I have something special.
Bye, Mrs. Robertson.
I have been such a fool.
Can you forgive me?
I always do, don't I?
You don't have to sleep on the chaise lounge tonight.
I don't?
You can sleep on your couch.
And have a talk with this young man, please.
Hey, Uncle Phil, man, look.
I'm 19 years old, and I'm gonna make some mistakes.
Yeah, I'm 45 and I make them too.
The secret is to learn from them.
Yeah, you right, I learned my lesson.
From now on, I'm only dating girls with ugly moms.
I'm gonna go lay on my couch.
Four, three, two Thank you.
Thank you.
Today on our show: Women who hate men, and the men who hate them back.
Cut it!
Great news, Hil.
Al has completely recovered from his coma.
I guess you're not gonna be needed.
Al, Al, Al!
Doesn't anybody care about my needs?
Do you have any idea how much this outfit cost?
And the statute's not up yet on that sexual harassment case.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Don't think I won't.
I'll drag you through the mud.
I went through so much to do this!
- Think because you got a pretty face - I caught up on everything!
you can talk to me like this!
- I am perfect!
I'm the producer!
I suppose you're gonna bring Al up on a sexual harassment suit too.
Well, you won't get away with it!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Yo, yo, what's up?
This is Will.
I can 't get to the phone right now.
I kind of got my hands full.
So leave a message, unless this is Carlton, in which case, don 't.
Will, it's Carlton.
I got an emergency.
Will, we just finished dinner and I think I left my wallet on the dresser, so could - Who was that?
- It's just a wrong number, baby.
Now, where was I?
Oh, there I was.
Greetings.
Look, munchkin, a romantic dinner for two.
Jazzy, maybe we should revise our plans.
You're right, my pet.
Let's unpack after we eat.
I told the landlord, I don't you repainting our apartment.
Those stains have memories.
Jazz, homey, look, now, you know, mi casa es su casa.
But, look, tonight, mi casa es mi casa.
That's okay, Will, I think I better go.
But, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey, baby.
Come on, you ain't got to do that.
Oh, yes, I do.
I'm really hungry.
Hey, baby, baby, I can have some Rotiserie Gold here in six minutes.
Well, you've done it again, haven't you?
Done what, Jazzy?
Munchkin, perhaps our visit is a little ill-timed.
Don't worry, me and Jewel could sleep out on a park bench.
I hear rain is nature's moisturizer.
Well, look, y'all might as well just stay.
You done messed everything up already anyway.
Thanks for hanging up.
I got thrown out of the restaurant and got a ticket for driving without a license.
What are they doing here?
Jazz's apartment is getting repainted.
Oh, like I care.
I'm going to my room, putting on my jammies and calling it a D-A-Y.
Either his head's getting smaller or his butt's getting bigger.
There's a whole army of these action figures around my bed.
They're fertility gods, Carlton.
Wait.
Y'all trying to have a baby?
Yeah.
Just because we're away from the marital bed don't mean we ain't gonna: Hey, whoa, whoa, guys.
Hey, listen.
I'm all for this being fruitful and multiplying thing but it's kind of close quarters here so you think y'all can put a boom-shaka-lock on it for a minute?
I'd like to accommodate you, my brother, but we're on a mission.
Not on my Posturepedic, bud.
Excuse us for a second.
Listen, Jazz, man, look.
I'm happy for you and your wife, but you think this mission could get scrubbed for a minute until your rocket is back on its launching pad?
No can do, Will.
The doctor at the clinic says this is when I'm at my most fertile which reminds me, sweetie.
I took my temperature, all systems go.
- Permission to board the mother ship.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, no, you don't.
There'll be no boarding of any kind, Mr. And Mrs What the heck is your last name anyway?
Hey, that's my bed.
Carlton, relax, I'll get you some new Barney sheets.
I cannot believe they're at it again.
Man, they are not human.
Hey, Jazz.
This ain't funny, man.
I command you to stop.
Roll away from the woman.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go sleep with Mom and Dad.
Careful Uncle Phil doesn't roll over on you again.
Well, the little darling's fast asleep.
Are you sure you didn't kill her?
I realize what a inconvenience we've been.
But since you ain't getting us no wedding present, this is the least you could do.
What are you talking about, man?
I gave you a wedding.
Take that to the bank.
Look, Will, making a baby is a truly blessed event.
I think you mean "having a baby," Jazz.
Trust me on this.
Look, Will, my Jewel's fondest dream is to have a child of her own.
I love her.
She's my delicate little flower.
Yo, crank it up!
Hey, take it easy in there, we're not insured.
Well, I don't think it's a very good idea for Jazz and Jewel to reproduce.
Right, big guy.
The prisons are crowded enough.
That's not fair.
If Jazz and Jewel wanna bring a child into this world who are we to judge?
We're not exactly perfect.
Hello.
So have you kids shopped for Mother's Day?
I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to buy their gifts.
- I'll get to the mall after lunch.
- Wait a minute.
Geoffrey is picking out your presents?
Of course not, big guy.
We told him exactly what to get.
Oh, yes.
Down to the very last detail, sir.
Let's see, there's " some kind of perfume or something," from Miss Hilary.
"A book might be neat," from Miss Ashley.
And, " here's 20 bucks and I expect some change back" from Master Carlton.
I can't believe you kids.
How will your mother feel when she finds out you didn't do your own shopping?
Oh, I have no problem with my own shopping.
I got my Mom something she gonna love.
She always wanted to get my baby shoes bronzed, but she never got around to it.
So I hooked her up.
Those are your baby shoes?
Well, yeah.
I had big feet.
You know what they say about a guy with big feet.
No, what?
They be saying, "Damn, you got some big feet".
Well As much as it pains me to admit it Will's got the right idea.
This year, I want you to pick out something handpicked personal and from the heart.
Now, you go out there and shop.
Yeah, that's right.
Feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
You feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
- Eloquent, sirs.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
Makes me wanna do something special for Mrs. Banks myself.
So you don't want me to get the usual dozen roses?
No, that's good enough.
Hey, Will.
Hey, I'm surprised y'all can walk.
Your levity is inappropriate.
We've been at the free clinic all morning to find out why my oven is as yet bunless.
Y'all haven't been baking long.
Hey, and I'm sure, if you stick with that recipe you'll get the ingredients mixed up How can you think about food at a time like this?
I mean, we ain't never gonna have a baby because my little soldiers ain't marching.
Bummer.
Jazz, didn't I tell you to not be wearing them bikini drawers?
You told me not to wear them in the streets.
- You ain't tell me not to wear them.
- All right, all right.
You know what?
It's probably just stress.
Yeah.
I'm sure that's what it is, man.
I mean, y'all just got married, and you're always running from the law.
And you know what?
Why don't you go to another free clinic, get a second opinion.
We can't afford another free clinic.
Jazz, look.
I'm really sorry for you, man.
I mean, hey, at least y'all tried.
Never heard two people try harder.
Don't try to comfort me, Will.
I'm uncomfortable.
Hey, look, Jewel.
- I'm sorry.
If there's anything I can do - As a matter of fact, there is.
Whatever it is, just let me know.
- You really mean that, Will?
- Name it.
I want your little soldiers.
What do you say?
Can I have your baby?
I'd really appreciate it.
Jewel, come on.
You are my best friend's wife.
As much as that excites me, I think I better pass.
I don't want your body, Will.
I want your little soldiers.
Do I look like the U. N?
Jewel, if Jazz ever found out about this, it would kill him.
So you in?
You know about this?
Know about it?
It was my idea.
What are y'all asking me to do?
Hey, look.
How about I give y'all something else, like a VCR?
You hear that, munchkin?
He's giving us a VCR too.
He's so full of love.
Let's hope so.
Come on, having a baby is a big responsibility.
We're ready for it.
Why, I even started saving for little Junior's college fund.
Listen, I don't think I can do this.
Sure you can.
Will.
Remember that time we went to go play ball and your shoelace broke and I gave you mine?
Same thing.
Jazz, man.
Don't you have some relatives or something?
Why me?
I mean, you got a good heart.
And you got a lot of smarts and you're tall, and you got good teeth.
Of course, we'll be praying he gets my ears.
We really want this baby, Will.
I mean, we love him already.
And we love you too.
And there's no one else we'd ask to be a part of our family.
How about a toaster?
Kids, I don't know how to thank you.
Such thoughtful gifts.
Well, you deserve them, Mom.
And these roses they are exquisite.
Thank you, honey.
You're welcome.
Well, you know, it's the thought that counts.
Yes, so think about sleeping on the couch for a while.
Mother, I wanted to buy you the perfect gift.
Something that would show you just how special you are.
But I couldn't find it, so I made it myself.
You made something?
Hilary, you can't even make change.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't even make Oh, shut up.
Anyway, I put this together at work.
My tribute to Vivian Banks.
It's a celebration of your greatest accomplishment.
Don't try to talk.
Let's all just share this moment.
May I help you?
Smith.
Will Smith.
I got appointment, you know, for the drawing.
You're a little embarrassed, aren't you?
Don't worry, we're all professionals here.
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate that.
Gladys, another customer for the happy booth.
Just have a seat and think lovely thoughts.
Yeah.
First time, kid?
Well, no, actually, I was 11 Oh, you mean, here?
Yeah, yeah.
- How about you?
- You kidding?
I come here once a week.
Why?
Well, a lot of couples wanna have babies and can't.
I like to think of myself as nature's middleman.
Kind of like a Johnny Appleseed without the apples, huh?
Once a week.
Mr. Considine?
I'm up.
- Good luck.
- Hey, hey, good luck.
Here you are, my brother, I brought you a card.
Hey, thanks, Jazz.
"Heard you had a stroke"?
It was the closest we could find.
You know, for some reason, Hallmark has overlooked this occasion.
Jazz.
I gotta be honest, man.
I'm just kind of nervous about this.
You want me to go in with you?
Look, Jazz, come on.
I mean What are you gonna tell people?
I'm gonna tell them it's my kid.
Will, this is between us.
No one must know of my secret shame.
The oath.
And to show you how grateful we are, we're taking you out tonight.
You know, in honor of Mother's Day.
Thanks a lot, Jazz.
I could just kiss you.
You know, that's not exactly the image I need right now.
Jazz Junior.
So join us in bidding goodbye to Jazz Junior the greatest player in the history of the NBA.
That boy down there has got good genes.
That boy got good genes.
You can't play no ball like that without having no good genes.
That my seat.
Move over.
And now, stepping up to the mike the one, the only, Jazz Junior.
I just wanna say that I owe it all to one man.
My father.
Stand up, Dad, take a bow.
I'm sorry, Will, but you don't belong here.
Ready, Mr. Smith?
No, I'm not.
I don't belong here.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Y'all at least could have waited until I got here before you ate.
Oh, we didn't order.
This was here when we sat down.
They're cheap tippers too.
Less than 15 percent.
- Will, I got some big news.
- Jewel, Jewel, listen.
Look, I got something I need to tell y'all.
- But we - Jazzy, listen.
Now, this whole having-a-kid thing, I'm telling you, it's overrated, man.
Babies.
I mean, they all bald and stanked up and nasty - Will, I'm pregnant.
- Jewel.
I was sitting up in the clinic I'm sorry, did you say something?
We're gonna have a baby, Jazzy and me.
How the hell did that happen?
Brother, I think me and you should talk.
No, I mean, one of your little soldiers established a beachhead?
You're gonna be a daddy?
Hey, congratulations, man.
Hey, listen, they having a kid and I ain't had nothing to do with it.
- Oh.
Man.
- Thanks, Will, for everything.
Hey.
Happy Mother's Day, Jewel.
Thanks, Will.
Come here, man, come here.
I know we invited you to dinner, but would you mind paying for it?
I saw my picture over the cash register.
Come on, Jazzy, let's hit the salad bar.
I brought my big purse.
I know you were looking forward to being a part of this.
- I hope you're not too disappointed.
- Oh, that.
You know what they say.
"Easy come, easy go".
I guess the world will have to wait a little for Will Smith, Jr. He'll come along someday.
Hey!
Happy Mother's Day, brother.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, man.
Good evening, sir, would you like to hear tonight's specials?
No, you No, thanks, man.
You know what?
You know what?
I just lost my damn appetite.
How will your mother feel when she finds out you didn't do your own shopping?
I have no How will your mother feel when she finds out you didn't do your own shopping?
Oh, I have no Same place.
We're rolling.
Space, the final frontier.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Carlton.
Man, you ever feel like you was being watched?
All the time.
When you look this good, you have to get used to it.
When you talk that stupid, you have to get used to this, man: What is wrong with you?
Come here.
Come here.
See that dude over there?
He been scoping me since he got here.
I think he's a cop.
Turn yourself in, Will.
It's the only way.
You're right.
You're right.
Wait a minute, man.
I ain't do nothing.
Hey, what's up, man?
Can I get you something?
No, I'm fine, son.
If you need So is he a cop?
He's my father.
Will.
You don't remember me.
- But - Yeah, I do.
Hey, what's up?
- Long time, huh?
- Fourteen years.
Uncle Lou, it's me, Carlton.
- Did you bring me anything?
- Carlton?
My goodness, haven't seen you since you were 3 years old.
I guess we all have a lot of catching up to do.
Let's see, where do I begin?
Well, when I was 6, we all moved from the hood And here I am today.
Excuse me.
Hey, you want some more coffee or something?
That would be nice.
When did you get so tall?
Mostly during the '80s.
Thanks.
So how'd you find me?
Well, I I talked to your mother three months ago.
I guess she didn't mention it to you.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, I was driving through L.A. On business I'm a trucker now.
Got my own rig and everything.
So I thought I'd stop by and see how my boy was doing.
Hey, I'm doing fine.
I'm busy, though.
I got a lot of work and stuff I need to do.
I understand, I understand.
- You take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
You too, all right?
Whoa, hold up.
Hey, you wanna stop by the crib later and have some dinner?
Oh, well, I know you're living with Philip and Vivian.
I don't think I'd be too welcome.
You know what I'm saying?
No, they'll be cool.
So look, I get off at 6.
It's great.
I'll pick you up then, son.
Okay.
Okay.
Good to see you again, Uncle Lou.
Wow, 14 years.
You must feel like you're on a roller coaster of emotions.
Hey, man, that ain't no big thing.
Sure.
Look, I'm here for you, my brother.
Let me hold you.
Hey, Aunt Viv.
Hi, Will.
Hi, Lou.
My God.
Vivian.
After all these years.
Still a stone cold fox.
Will, you should have told me.
You really should have told me.
I asked Geoffrey to tell you.
I thought it might be more fun this way.
And I was right.
G, I'd like you to meet Lou Smith.
Show Lou to the family room, please, while Will helps me here with something.
- This way, sir.
How are you doing?
No, I'm cool, Aunt Viv.
I stopped on the way home.
I had a few drinks.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
You think that Uncle Phil is gonna be cool with this?
- I think so.
Yeah.
- All right.
If I can stop him from coming home.
Who is this beautiful woman?
She's Hilary.
- Hilary, this is - I'm Will's father.
Oh, come on.
Will's father is a deadbeat who left him and his mom flat.
- Hello.
- Uncle Lou!
Well, let's just sit down and have a nice, quick visit.
- Vivian.
- Oh, that was fun.
Why is there a truck parked in my?
What are you doing here?
Philip, can I see you in the kitchen, please?
- I should go.
- Don't be silly.
Who knows if we'd ever see you again?
Come on.
I must be an old man, because little Ashley's all grown up.
Yeah, Ashley this is your Uncle Lou.
Uncle Lou?
- You mean he's your - Yeah, that's right.
He's my Lou.
And this must be little Nicky.
- May I?
- Sure.
Oh, yes, yes.
You know, Will, I used to hold you just like this.
Then why'd you run out on him?
Well, Lou.
It's been a while.
How long are you in town for?
A couple of days.
On some business.
Yeah, Uncle Phil, he owns his own trucking company now.
Well, one truck.
But I am my own boss.
And I'm making a little money.
Why didn't you send any back to the wife and child you abandoned?
- Hey, Uncle Phil, man.
- You promised.
Look, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll skip dinner.
I don't have much of an appetite.
Shall I call 911?
I ain't scared of no kiddie roller coaster ride.
Please, you was up there screaming so loud I thought I was sitting next to Patti LaBelle.
Will, I owe you an explanation.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
You see the day you were born was the happiest day of my life.
The first time I held you I didn't think I'd ever put you down.
So why did you?
I just wasn't ready to be a father.
I started feeling trapped.
Well, one day I just panicked and ran.
It was selfish and cowardly but that's what I did.
- I'm sorry.
- Look, why are you telling me this now?
Because you're my son and I love you.
And I'm a different man now.
I'm ready to be part of your life, if you'll let me.
- Part of my life.
How?
- Yeah.
Well, for one, we can get to know one another.
And did you know your old man was All City point guard?
- Really?
- Yeah, man.
I still hold the record for the most consecutive foul shots.
- You don't believe me?
- I didn't say nothing.
No, I see you don't believe me.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
Don't let this height fool you, you hear?
- I didn't say nothing.
- No, you didn't have to say nothing.
Don't hurt yourself now.
I don't want to take you back broke.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Anybody can make one.
They have little girls out here that can make one.
- Yeah.
- Well, two ain't nothing either.
He's really good.
He's my dad.
- Yeah.
- He's good.
All right, give me that ball.
Listen, Vy, I told you last night, we're keeping a close eye on Will.
He's doing fine.
Everything is What?
Yeah, Lou still looks great.
Hey, I'm sorry.
He does.
Okay, fine.
He's puffed up like a blowfish and bald as an egg.
Were your ears burning, sir?
- We're back.
- I have to go.
Bye-bye.
Did you have a good time?
We rode every roller coaster in the park.
Yeah, almost threw up like three times.
That's my boy.
I'm glad you two got to spend some time together.
We just getting started, right, Daddy?
- Yep.
- What do you mean?
My dad has to hit the road tomorrow.
And I'm gonna go with him.
Why should I spend my summer wasting at the Peacock when I can hit the road with my dad?
Hey, watch yourself, watch yourself.
It's a great way for Will to see the country.
- Forget it.
- Come on, Phil.
The boy could use a little adventure.
Excuse me, but this is a family discussion.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'll wait in the pool house.
Uncle Phil, that is not cool, the way you dissing my father like that.
The hell with your father.
- Philip, for God's sake.
- He waltzes in here after 15 years?
- Fourteen.
- Excuse me, 14 years.
And acts like nothing has happened.
Wake up, Will.
This is the same guy who didn't think enough of you to pick up the phone.
He made a mistake.
I'm sorry that everybody can't be as perfect as you, Uncle Phil.
But if I can forgive him, how come you can't?
Because he's doing this for himself.
If you think any differently, then you're a fool.
Hey, just cool it.
Just cool down.
We can talk about this another time.
You know what, Aunt Viv ain't even nothing to talk about.
I've been waiting for this for a long time, my whole life and ain't nobody gonna stop me.
Come tomorrow, I'm out of here.
- I don't think so.
- Who cares what you think?
You are not my father!
You know, sir whenever I'm feeling blue I think of the poem my dear mum used to recite to me as a lad.
The master lives a life of ease While we live life upon our knees Waste not your tears And save your breath For soon he'll die a violent death Works for me.
Daddy, I had a little accident at the mall.
I'm okay.
But I totaled your MasterCard.
That's okay, honey.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Here, pick a card.
Well, I'll just take this pretty gold one.
Thanks, Daddy.
- What's with him?
- I don't know.
He's like a genie on Valium.
Make a wish, hurry.
Daddy, there's a dance next Friday, but it's not over till midnight.
That's okay, stay out as late as you wish.
Really?
- Well, then, can l?
- Hey, save some for me.
- Say, big guy - Carlton am I a good father?
- Are you kidding?
You're the best.
- Oh, thank you, son.
- Can I have access to my trust fund?
- Not a chance.
I hate you!
Oh, yeah?
Well, take a number.
Here comes Mr. Sunshine.
Shut up, Geoffrey.
Philip, stop moping.
You know Will didn't mean what he said.
Well, why'd he say it?
For four years, I treated that boy like my own son.
Whether he needed a pat on the head or a kick in the pants, I was there for him.
I worked my ass off trying to keep him in line.
And yet, it's come back with a vengeance.
I have done everything for Will.
Suddenly, it's like none of that matters.
I can't believe he could be so selfish.
Philip, listen to yourself.
Somebody's being selfish all right, but it isn't Will.
Will, do you mind if I move your things around while you're gone?
No, it's cool.
Knock yourself out, man.
You know, Carlton, up until a few days ago I never even thought I'd see my father again.
It was like I couldn't even think about it because I knew it wasn't gonna happen.
But I still managed to keep the fantasy.
Now it's real.
I can't believe how lucky I am.
Yeah, it's a miracle.
Hold the tape measure.
Carlton, I'm only going for the summer, man.
Hi.
Can I speak to Will alone, please?
You're not gonna talk him into staying?
- Get out.
- Right.
Look Uncle Phil, I owe you an apology.
No, no, no, I'm the one.
I'm sorry.
I guess we both said some things we didn't mean.
No, I meant what I said.
I was just out of line.
Uncle Phil, man, you know I appreciate everything you've done for me.
But this ain't about you.
This is something I gotta do for me.
Yeah, I know.
I know, son.
And I wish you the best.
Good luck.
I'll miss you.
Me too, man.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
I mean, you know that this is just for the summer, right?
Where's Lou?
He's supposed to be here an hour ago.
I knew this was gonna happen.
- Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
- Yeah, on his way out of town.
- Mr. Smith has arrived.
- Sorry, I'm late.
Business.
I talked to this guy who's got this shipment.
Gotta go from L.A. To Maine in 72 hours if I can make it.
And I can make it because I am the best.
- And I'll make myself a quick five grand.
- Yeah.
That's terrific.
You and Will better get a move on.
Well, now, that's the problem.
As good as I am, I can't make the deadline by myself.
So I'm gonna pick up an extra driver.
So there won't be any room for Will.
- Not this trip, no.
- But, you know, I'll tell you what, Lou.
I'll buy Will a plane ticket to Maine and that way you could hook up and have the summer together.
That's mighty generous of you, Philip but this job could lead to another big one and I gotta stay flexible, you know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Will is gonna be crushed.
Yeah.
That's why I was thinking maybe you two should break the news to him.
Vivian, would you take Nicky upstairs, please?
You're not gonna hit him, are you?
Because I don't wanna miss that.
No, I'm not gonna hit him.
Lou, if you walk out of Will's life now don't you ever come back.
- Sit down.
- I ain't got time for no lecture.
I said, sit down, Lou.
You know, Will was doing just fine till you showed up.
But now that you're back, you have responsibilities to him.
- Look, we're still gonna take the trip.
- Oh, bull!
Bull.
Will is not a coat that you hang in the closet then pick it up when you're ready to wear it.
His life goes on.
He's not supposed to be here for you.
- You're supposed to be here for him.
- You get off my back!
You think I want this?
It just happened.
Now, when Will was a baby, I was scared Cut the crap, all right?
Cut it.
Because I've been there.
But I didn't run out on my family.
I was there every day for them.
Because that's what a man does.
Fine, Philip.
You win.
You the man.
You a better man than me.
You happy?
Now you gonna tell Will or not?
I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you.
Fine.
- I'll call him.
- Yeah, do that.
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Daddy-O.
What's up?
Will.
Man, I'm glad you're here.
Some business came up I gotta handle.
So we're gonna have to put our trip on hold.
You understand?
Yeah, that's cool.
- Just for a couple of weeks.
- I understand.
- Maybe a little longer.
- Yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Look, I'll call you next week and we'll iron out the details.
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
It was great seeing you, son.
You too, Lou.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- I'm sorry, Will.
- Actually, this works out better for me.
The slimmies this summer come to class wearing next to nothing.
- Will, it's all right to be angry.
- Hey, why should I be mad?
At least he said goodbye this time.
I just wish I hadn't wasted my money buying this stupid present.
I'm sorry.
If there was something that l You know what, you ain't got to do nothing, Uncle Phil.
It ain't like I'm still 5 years old.
Ain't like I'll be sitting up every night asking my mom: "When's Daddy coming home"?
Who needs him?
He wasn't there to teach me how to shoot my first basket, but I learned.
- And I got pretty good at it too.
- Yeah.
Got through my first date without him.
I learned how to drive.
I learned how to shave.
How to fight.
I had 14 great birthdays without him.
He never even sent me a damn card.
To hell with him!
I didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
- Will - You know what, Uncle Phil?
I'm gonna get through college without him.
I'll get a great job without him.
I'll marry a beautiful honey, have a bunch of kids and be a better father than he ever was.
I don't need him for that, because there ain't a thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids.
How come he don't want me, man?
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
- Sir?
- Oh, it's delicious.
You should eat some first.
Sir, I hate to disturb you during feeding time but there's a man snooping around the premises.
Daddy, call the police.
- I'll handle this.
- No, no, no.
I got this one, Uncle Phil.
What are you doing in our back yard?
Oh, my God, Uncle Phil, he's got a business card.
I'm sorry if I startled anyone.
Nobody answered the front door.
- I'm a realtor.
Ron Reed.
- How are you?
That doesn't give you the right to go traipsing around our property.
I've got a client prepared to make a generous offer on this house.
Well, then come on in, Ron.
It is Ron, isn't it?
Sit down.
Take a load off.
Yes.
Care for some salmon?
Carlton.
- What kind of offer, Mr. Reed?
- Well above market value.
My client wants to buy it for his nephew.
- But this house is not for sale.
- How much?
Shut up, Carlton.
Mr. And Mrs. Banks, if you'll hear me out.
You see, my client's nephew grew up in this house in the '50s and he'd like to repurchase it for sentimental reasons.
- How much?
- Shut up, Carlton.
Hey, Uncle Phil, man you're not really going to consider selling this house, are you?
I mean, come on, this place is special to us.
I'm authorized to bid a half million dollars above fair-market value.
I'm going to pack my stuff, all right?
It's kind of tempting, huh?
Especially with the real estate market being so soft.
Am I the only one who doesn't think making money is always the bottom line?
Let's hope so.
Very funny, Carlton.
Look, some stranger wants to buy this house for sentimental reasons.
What about our sentimental reasons?
We love this house.
You know, I mean I think Ashley's right.
I mean, this place has got a lot of memories.
Living here has been almost a religious experience.
My father would kill me if he knew I was out with a boy tonight.
I told him I was going to church.
The Lord is good.
Why don't you come on over here, sit down and relax.
Okay.
Well, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.
And, I ain't even oiled up yet, you know.
Hey, you know what?
You can sell the house.
It's the couch that got the memories.
And the Jacuzzi.
- Carlton's little typewriting table.
- Hey.
Look, kids, this is serious.
What should we do, Philip?
I can't imagine living someplace else.
This is where we raised our children and taught them to be responsible adults.
- Here, Hilary, you take it out.
- Out where?
To the trash cans.
You know, those things you hit every time you back out the car.
Thank God, I thought it was the neighbor's kids.
This is gross.
I don't touch greasy, disgusting things.
Well, just pretend it's buying you dinner afterwards.
- You take it.
- Come on, girl.
And for your information, dinner comes first.
It's like that, right, you're gonna slam garbage at me.
Good morning, Will.
- Good morning.
Here's your lunch.
- Thank you.
We all knew that Ashley was, well, cute.
But with my help, she has turned into an absolute knockout.
So it gives me great pleasure to present the new Ashley Banks.
Well, isn't she the most gorgeous creature you've ever seen?
Ashley, sweetheart, are you comfortable dressed like this?
Well, Daddy, it all comes down to what Robert thinks, and Ashley, aren't we forgetting something?
You're so in tune with my needs.
It was amazing and endless and magnificent.
I think I saw God.
- Don't stop.
- The windows I'm sorry.
- I fell.
I fell.
I fell.
- We didn't mean to You'd think in a house this big, a fellow would get a little privacy.
Or stronger doors.
Whatever.
I still think we shouldn't sell this house.
It's home.
Well, now, Ashley, this house obviously means a lot to all of us.
But you don't get an offer like this everyday.
- I'll have to give it some consideration.
- Excuse me?
I mean, your mother and I will have to give it some real consideration.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?
Dear?
If we end up moving into another guesthouse I'm getting the bedroom this time.
- Not so fast, buster.
Who knows if the new place is even gonna have a guesthouse?
Don't worry, we'll bring a shoebox you can sleep in.
Listen, my friend, I haven't exactly gotten a kick out of being your roommate either.
I mean, I can't imagine anything more irritating than sharing a pool house with you.
I can.
How about sharing a jail cell with you?
Come on, man, let it go.
You'll feel better.
Yeah, well, that whole fiasco was your fault.
You're totally immature.
I'm immature?
Well, isn't that the munchkin calling the midget short.
Oh, what a night, I made a killing.
Twenty-six Milky Ways.
And the Democrats say there's a recession.
What are you supposed to be?
My idol, Macaulay Culkin.
And you know why he's my idol?
Why?
Because y'all the same height?
How dare you two defy me?
Now, see here, big guy.
Oh, my God!
Howard!
And to think, I laid out And not just any cake, I got you that really neat one in the commercials.
You know, the one that goes: Carlton, Carlton.
Come to think of it, I don't know how I've been around you this long.
What's wrong with being around me?
Well, how about I'll take "always embarrassing me" for 500, Alex.
What have I ever done to embarrass you?
Well, you got a few days?
You really think we made it?
Hey, look, man, whether we did or not, you hung in there and I'm proud of you.
You're proud of me?
You never said that to me before in your life.
Give me a hug.
You see, man, that is exactly why I'll never tell you nothing.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Admit it, Will.
You care about me.
I do not.
Yes, you do.
You like me.
You like having me around.
Carlton, take it back, man.
Face it.
You've just got to face it.
You love me.
All right, that was a bad example.
I mean, you're not so much of an embarrassment.
Apology accepted.
Hey, Carl Come one.
Hey, man.
Damn.
So after careful consideration, we've decided not to sell.
- Oh, Daddy.
- Oh, man!
When it came down to it, we just couldn't part with this place.
In the final analysis, there are more important things than money.
Would everyone stop saying that?
I'm getting a migraine.
We got some baby Tylenol in the kitchen.
Hello.
Ron.
Yeah, I was just going to call you.
Look, we've talked it over, and we've decided not to sell.
No, I'm sorry, I don't think there's anything that you can say that could change What's that?
You're kidding.
Could you hold on for a minute, please?
Thank you.
Philip, what's going on?
Ron said that his buyer is willing to go $ 1 million dollars above market value.
Yes, there is a God!
Look at you all.
Will say something.
Ching, ching!
Okay, thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
That was Ron.
The buyer is flying in this evening from New York.
Yeah!
A million dollars.
But I don't want to move.
Hey, girl.
Now, Ashley, this is a million dollars here.
Now, listen, Uncle Phil could put that money in the bank, right and then start getting all kinds of crazy interest.
Then it's bonds, and then there's that T-bill stuff and then they got some certificates, and then junk be compounded.
- What are you talking about?
- I have no idea.
Money, money, money.
Is that all you people care about?
I have been very happy in this house.
A lot of exciting things have happened to me here.
Ashley, you're 15 years old.
I mean, how much excitement could you possibly have had?
A lot more than you, Carlton.
Happy birthday, Ashley.
I think I'd feel better if I could kiss you.
I'm sorry.
Is that terrible?
No.
Is it terrible that I wanna kiss you back?
Can I blow in your ear?
Why?
I don't know, I heard Will say it.
Okay.
Hey, Ashley, you ain't telling me that dude blew in your ear.
Me either.
I embellished.
Uncle Phil, I think you've more than made your opinion known to Ashley and her boyfriends.
- Who do we have here?
- We met at the mall.
What's your name, son?
This.
This is a stick with a snake wrapped around it.
- It's a symbol, like Prince.
- Prince who?
See, that's exactly why fathers ain't allowed at the mall.
What's this thing?
It's a symbol for "get out of my house"!
So I lost my temper once.
Who hasn't?
Excuse me.
Once?
Speaking as a lawyer, I say your daughter suits the criminal profile to a T. Right down to the low-sloping forehead and the wide jaw suitable for grains and small rodents.
I think you must have her confused with your mama.
I don't want you to move out.
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.
He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.
Excuse me.
Is this what you've been telling my boy?
- What?
- That life is one big orgy.
- I ain't never said - College is hard work, son Followed by a family, which is even more hard work.
And a teenage daughter who doesn't wanna be seen with you in public.
And a wife who won't let you anywhere near her.
And a butler who may be the father of your child.
- And a gardener, a gardener - Dad!
Dad!
You big-eared freeloader!
You take your little square-headed cousin here and you find Geoffrey, and you bring him back or they'll never find your bodies.
And I'm a judge, I can make it happen.
All right.
All right, so I have an ugly side.
And you could write "Goodyear" on it.
The more I think about it, I won't mind saying goodbye to this place.
I mean, I've experienced the greatest tragedies of my life here.
Damn.
And I mean that in the nicest possible way, Hil.
I look like a troll doll.
Look, there he goes.
Hilary Banks Yes, Trevor?
Will you marry me?
I ain't no bungee expert or nothing but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that.
If I hadn't asked for a special proposal Trevor would be in my arms instead of in my purse.
I love you, Trevor.
Hilary Trevor wasn't cremated.
Then who's this?
I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.
I'm still not over that hair thing.
We're gonna need some hors d'oeuvres tonight.
- What do we have in the house?
- Whatever he hasn't eaten.
Geoffrey, for once, could you please cut the sarcasm?
Sarcasm?
Whatever do you mean?
Geoffrey, go fetch my tools.
You mean your knife and fork?
Jazz, to what do we owe your presence?
My guess would be inbreeding.
Sweetheart, it hasn't been that long since we've made love, has it?
Five months this Tuesday.
Why, that's just good-natured ribbing, sir unlike those ruthless barbs from Master William.
Me?
Earthquake!
Man changed my life.
Turned a skinny little kid from South Carolina into the man you see today.
And you know how?
He challenged me.
To what?
A pie eating contest?
What is wrong with you people?
I weigh the same thing I weighed in high school.
Yeah, if you add up all four years.
Hey, hey, man.
Man, have I told you how thin you're looking lately?
You know, especially around your chins.
I mean Damn.
That must be him.
Now, we're doing the right thing, aren't we?
We should sell.
Oh, my God, she's buckling, Dad.
- Throw some cold water on her.
- Carlton.
Of course we're doing the right thing, sweetheart.
Sir, it is my esteemed pleasure to introduce Mr. And Mrs. Donald Trump.
It's The Donald!
Oh, my God!
Mr. And Mrs. Trump, it's an honor to meet you.
Well, Ron said his client had a rich uncle, but Donald Trump.
I like keeping a low profile.
- Hi.
Hilary Banks.
- Hi, Hilary.
You know, you look much richer in person.
Hey, Mr. Trump.
Hey, how are you doing?
Will Smith.
Hey, listen, you are getting a great house here.
And this is quite a deal you're getting for it too.
Tell you what, throw in another 50 grand, I'll cut the grass for you every Saturday.
Look, folks, before we go too far, I've got something to tell you.
Excuse me, but I've got something to tell you first.
Thank you for ruining my life.
- Ashley.
- What did you do?
Everybody's always blaming me for everything.
Come on, let's sit down, sign some papers.
Mr. Banks, there's been a little mistake.
Mr. Trump's nephew grew up at 508 Saint Cloud Road.
And all this time I thought our address was 805 Saint Cloud Road.
It is, Hilary.
It's very embarrassing.
Apparently, I inverted the numbers.
I don't know what to say, except I'm sorry.
That makes two of us.
Well, that's business.
Let's go down the street.
I brought cash, it's quicker.
Nice meeting you all.
It's just as well, it's too much of a fixer-upper.
Vivian, Vivian, Vivian!
What happened?
Donald Trump walked in, and you passed out.
Donald!
Where is he?
He'll be the guy carrying the millions of dollars in cash.
If you hurry up, man Well, I guess this makes you very happy?
And you are too.
Come on, admit it.
Yes, we're staying.
Yeah, it's You know, it's probably for the best.
I guess deep down inside none of us really wanted to move.
Of course, I do hear Des Moines is great this time of year.
In five, four, three, two But it'll cut into my trick or treat Here we go.
But it'll cut into my trick or treat I'm just gonna say my line and "go".
I just won a thousand dollars.
Five, four, three, two It ain't me.
It ain't me.
- It was him.
- No, I was here.
I was cool.
Oh, yeah.
I can't get it out.
I cannot get it out.
Come on, one more shot.
One more shot.
One more shot.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Hey, hey, hey, y'all ready to hit the City of Sisterly Love?
Don't you mean "Brotherly Love"?
Take my word on this one, Carlton.
It doesn't matter how you sugar coat it, Will this vacation has all the earmarks of stinking.
- Well, I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah, me too.
Come on, Carlton.
This is Philadelphia in the springtime.
Man, there's people all over the place.
There's guys playing stickball.
- Girls in the street playing double dutch.
- No country club reciprocity.
Geoffrey, we'll be gone for about four or five days.
You know what to do.
Don't worry, sir, the house is in excellent hands.
Do we have to go?
Carlton, your Aunt Vy is dying to show us how she's redecorated her home.
- God forbid she should send a picture.
- Philip.
Come on, kids, let's go.
Oh, all right, let's get it over with.
Carlton, would you cool out a little bit, man.
What, just because you're not going to some fancy resort somewhere that means you can't have a good time?
It is a damn shame when people are spoiled by money.
G, put some butter on that, bring that out to me in the car.
Come on, y'all come right on in.
Make yourself at home.
Oh, there it is, y'all.
Hey, check it out.
My TV chair.
I spent 10 years customizing this thing to my boogie.
Now, I don't want none of y'all sitting in it and stretching out my sweet spot.
Y'all know who you are.
Don't make me kill you in your mother's home.
I'm going to check out my bedroom.
Well, what do you guys think?
Vy, you have really perked this place up.
Hasn't she, Hilary?
Yeah.
I mean it's so poor.
Hey, my bedroom is exactly how I left it.
I even found my What's Happening!
Home game.
What's Happening!
Or What's Happening Now?
What's Happening!
Neato!
I get to be Rerun.
Listen, go find yourself a beret, and I'm gonna go get my stuff unpacked.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
I'm putting both of you right out here on the convertible couch.
And Ashley and Hilary will be with me.
Philip and Vivian will have your room.
Hey, Mom, listen, you should probably make sure that Uncle Phil sleeps on the bottom bunk.
Because if he get up on the top bunk Well, you know gravity ain't no joke.
You know what I'm saying?
He could end up in China.
You know, Vy, we don't wanna be any trouble.
Why don't we just make reservations at a hotel and just get out of your hair.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- No, no, no.
- There is plenty of room right here.
- Yep, yep.
And I'll take it as a personal insult if you guys leave.
Yep.
Yep, yep, yep.
How about if just I left?
That's what I get for being considerate.
Vy, we'd be happy to stay here with you.
All of us.
Good, but don't bother unpacking now, because we got to get to the ballpark.
Teddy Pendergrass is singing the national anthem.
Oh, yeah, Phillies in the house!
You know, Vy, we're all a little jet-lagged.
Well, I know Will wants to go.
Yeah, take the sub right to Broad and Patterson.
- You know it.
- Hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll race you to the station.
Loser pays the fare.
You're on.
But wait a minute.
Tie your shoes first.
You're cheating.
You're cheating.
My mama cheating.
Come here!
How come we never had that much fun?
I don't know.
What's on TV?
God, I wish I was home.
Right about now, I bet Geoffrey is turning back my covers and putting a little mint on my pillow.
Hey, program!
Hey, program!
Here we go, man.
How you doing, man?
Here you go.
Thanks.
Here it is, y'all, best hoagie spot in the whole city.
They got the kind of food here that sticks to your ribs.
And your feet.
What do you have to tip the maitre d' to get a good stool?
Unless you're here to stick up the joint, sit down and eat.
Take a tip, buddy, you won't get anywhere in the service industry treating customers like that.
Why don't you take your Bing Crosby butt over to the golden arches and lie down in front of a drive-through window.
Ain't he great?
Hey, dude, give me four cheese steaks, man.
Four Joe Frazier's in cheese trunks.
- Joe Frazier?
- Yeah, it means "big beef".
Duke names all the sandwiches after people.
- Give me one with mushrooms, dude.
- Wrap one in fungus.
I don't believe it.
This is the only song this jukebox ever played.
We used to sing to this all the time.
Yo, Dumbo, pick up.
Y'all gonna love these drawers.
Hey, thanks a lot, Duke.
I've been dying for one of these.
My God, these are a mess.
They're filled with grease.
Yeah, it's great, ain't it?
Hey, Will, is that the legendary park where you used to play basketball?
Oh, yeah, it sure is.
You call that pathetic strip of graffiti-littered concrete legendary?
Can we go there after we eat?
No.
No, no, I don't think so.
Wow, it's Dick Clark.
Hey, I grew up watching you.
- Thank you, thank you.
- How come I got older, but you didn't?
Duke's sandwiches, a fountain of youth.
Duke, give me a chicken sandwich to go, will you?
Sure thing, Mr. Clark.
One Will Smith.
Will Smith?
Yeah, we named it after this guy who got into a little scrape across the street.
Only instead of fighting, he ran clear across the country to California.
He was a chicken to go.
What a coincidence, his name is Will Smith.
You're kidding Wait a second.
Yeah, a little taller.
The ears were a little bigger, but it is you!
My man!
All right!
Listen, it's me, but I didn't exactly run.
Hey, look.
Hey, Mr. Clark, we got another celebrity over here.
Say hello to Chicken Will.
Come on, my man, strut your stuff.
Hey, it's got a good beat, and you can run to it.
Not you too, Dick.
Hey, there he goes, he's running again.
Hey!
Hey, where you going?
California's the other way!
Okay, okay.
Yeah!
If it isn't the Fresh Prince!
Man, what y'all been into?
Nothing, man, just working them 40 hours.
Yo, man, we thought you was living phat in California?
Yeah, I was.
And I would have stayed there if I'd have known I was getting played like a clown back here.
That's not true.
Everybody just wanna know where you been.
Gladys, look, that's Vy's boy, Will.
- Hey, Will.
- How you doing?
- That's funny?
- I ain't laughing.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
I thought y'all was my boys.
Why you ain't telling my rep was getting sliced up.
Yo, we are your boys, man.
We figured you was never coming back.
But every time somebody tried to diss you, we step to them.
We got beat up plenty of times protecting your rep.
- Right.
- Word.
- Y'all did?
- Yeah, man.
We don't run away from our fights.
- We can't.
All our relatives live here.
- Right.
All right, you hooligans, disperse.
Stop taunting my cousin just because he ran away from a fight.
Look, stumpy, I did not run.
I just went to visit y'all for four years.
Look, this is Chill, Soup, Steve, Word.
What's up, stumpy?
Why won't you go upstairs if you gotta use the bathroom.
Hey, mister, there's nothing worse than dirty Dockers.
Look, squash that.
What am I supposed to do about my rep?
Yo, you got to stand up to Omar Boulware, man.
- Word.
- Who's Omar Boulware?
Some guy Will wouldn't fight.
The dude that be spinning me over his head in the opening credits.
Man, that is one mean brother, man.
Yo, remember in junior high when he stole the principal's car just to run him over?
Yo, where he be hanging at, man?
Yo, he down around Shepherd Park, man.
You're not thinking of fighting this ruffian, are you?
Look, that's the only way, man.
Word.
Yo, Will, we got your back, man.
- He can't take all of us.
- Straight up.
That's right.
I've been reading.
I appreciate y'all having my back and everything but, you know, I gotta take care of this myself.
All right.
Hey, Carlton, come here, man.
Listen, I need your help, man.
I gotta go into training.
I'm gonna kick Omar's butt.
- Come on.
- I thought you said this is one-on-one.
- What do you need me for?
- Well, if I win, I need a witness.
If I lose, you're my blood type.
Come on.
- Keep cool.
- All right, man.
Gee, this playground makes the other one look like Club Med.
- Come on, what are you trying to prove?
- You don't understand about reputations.
I mean, they can follow you around like a bad smell.
Maybe you do understand.
I do know one thing, Will a bad smell isn't worth a mouthful of bloody Chicklets.
Let me explain something to you I'm not some skinny little If anybody's gonna be bleeding, it's gonna be that big, pumpkin-head Omar.
- Will - Carlton, I have the advantage.
Not only is he big and dumb, he's slow.
- Will - Carlton it's like his brain is so tiny, if he shake his big head like this it'd sound like a BB in a canteen.
Does he wear a black sweatshirt?
How am I supposed to remember if he wears a black sweatshirt?
Turn around.
Hey, man.
Yo, man, we got this court.
Is that so?
You don't remember who I am, do you?
I don't care who you are.
I said we got this court.
You funny.
Listen, we ain't scared of you, man.
Me and Carlton can take you.
You and who?
Carlton.
Ain't that right?
Carlton?
Geoffrey, I will never live down the shame of a domestic vacation.
Look, go to Rodeo Drive, buy a bunch of stuff send it to someone you know in England and have him mail it to all my friends.
Where have you two been?
I sent you out of here four hours ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
We went for a long walk.
I love this city.
Tell her about that scrapple place.
You ate scrapple?
That's made from the part of the pig that's not good enough to go in sausage.
- But it's good enough to go in Philip.
- Oh, baby.
Yeah, well, this is all very nice, but where are my groceries?
I knew we forgot something.
I don't know, I'm supposed to be in England.
Get some English muffins.
Is that Geoffrey?
Let me talk to him.
Geoffrey, I can't find my gold silk bathrobe, did you pack it?
Did I forget to pack that?
I'll keep an eye out for it, sir.
I'm sure it will turn up.
Enjoy the rest of your vacation.
Goodbye.
There is room for one more.
Let me tell you something, man.
You have kicked me off of this court for the last time.
I don't remember kicking you off the first time.
- You really don't remember me, huh?
- No.
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, can I see that ball, brother?
How about a little hint?
Oh, I remember you.
But, hey, man, I'm not like that anymore.
Oh, really.
You look like the same bald-headed punk to me.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the chicken sandwich guy.
I am not a chicken!
My mama made me move, man.
My mama made me move.
I would never leave Philly!
I love it here.
So do I. That's why I'm giving back to it.
I stayed to help the kids in the area so that they wouldn't make the same mistakes I did.
You sound like an after-school special, or something.
But that ain't gonna do nothing for my rep.
Let's go right now, and I ain't taking no for an answer.
You have no choice.
Let's go.
Okay, well, you're so stupid, you thought a quarterback was a refund.
How about that?
You so ugly, when you was born the doctor just slapped both your parents.
And your mom Oh, my goodness!
She is like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn!
I guess the mom's the red button.
Okay, come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Look here, man I know what you're trying to do, but I am not gonna hit you.
Then I'm gonna tell everybody you're a punk, then.
- Be my guest.
- What about your rep?
Look, you see those guys over there?
That's my rep.
Brother, you need to grow up.
Will.
Let me know when you need me.
- Thank you for a lovely time.
- You're welcome.
Will, the plane leaves in an hour.
Come on, hurry it up.
Oh, baby, it was so good having you.
And here.
Here's the Phillies schedule.
Maybe you can come back when they make it to the World Series.
I can't do it.
No need to get melodramatic, Will.
Just watch it on TV with the rest of us.
I'm talking about going back to Bel-Air.
I ain't ready to leave yet, y'all.
I'm still having fun.
Fun?
You've been ostracized since you got here.
What you talking about?
That Chicken Will thing?
That ain't nothing.
Guys be tripping like that all the time.
You mean I was in a garbage can for nothing?
When were you in a garbage can?
Look, I'm just saying, you know I didn't realize how much I miss just sitting out on the stoop.
Look, when we get back, Dad will buy us a stoop.
Come on, we're gonna miss the plane.
Yeah, I don't wanna spend another minute in this sardine can.
Thanks for everything, Aunt Vy.
Will, I'll tell you what you stay for another week or so, then you come home when you're ready, okay?
- All right.
- Thanks a lot, Vy.
It was wonderful.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
- Call me when you get home.
- I will.
- Okay, take care.
- All right, bye, Hillary.
Bye, Ashley.
Well, isn't this a surprise?
- Just me and you, just like old times.
- That's right.
Now, go clean up your room.
Go on.
- What time is Will's plane coming in?
- I don't know.
He was supposed to call with his flight arrangements but he gets so wrapped up in his own life that he cannot take the time to be a little bit responsible.
That must be him now.
- Hello?
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
Will, are you at the airport?
No, I'm at home.
Well, what happened?
You miss your flight?
Sort of.
Well, when you coming back, then?
I'm not.
