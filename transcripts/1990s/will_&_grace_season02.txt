{START OF EPISODE 1}
Okay.
this is the last one.
I still don't get why you didn't just hire moving guys.
I think we did fine on our own.
I know but moving guys are hot.
Firemen are hot.
You want me to set something on fire?
- So.
do we like my new apartment?
- We do.
You're gonna love it here.
I don't think it smells anything like cat pee.
Why are you that man?
Why are you an awful.
heinous breeder of discord?
- I'm kidding.
- Are you kidding?
- I'm kidding!
- Are you kidding?
It smells like room deodorizer.
Cat-pee-scented room deodorizer.
Shut up!
This is a big deal for me.
My God.
you and I haven't spent more than 24 hours apart since I dumped my fiancé on our wedding day.
What a proud moment that was.
I'm gonna miss living with you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You know.
the way we tell each other what to wear in the morning.
The way you'd fall asleep in front of the TV with that little string of drool from the mouth to the shoulder.
The way you'd try and make Jewish soup for me when I was sick.
Or you'd perch on the balcony and make cooing noises.
jutting your head back and forth  No.
no.
that was pigeons.
I get mixed up.
See?
I'm trying to be sentimental here.
and you're doing shtick.
I don't want to get sentimental.
If I get sentimental.
I'll realize how much I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.
-  - Go.
go.
I don't wanna get upset.
- Yeah.
right.
- I really like your new place.
- Thanks.
Call me when you get home.
- First thing.
- Bye.
Bye.
It is weird living apart.
Yeah.
We are living apart.
right?
I mean.
this is healthier?
Of course it is.
Will.
if it were unhealthy.
we wouldn't even think to ask if it were unhealthy.
Good point.
Oh.
so I gave my phone number to that guy at Borders Books.
Phone number or business card?
- Business card.
- Not hot.
Why.
what?
Hi.
I'm intimidated by the possibility of rejection.
But my secretary isn't.
Call her.
- I'm not intimidated by anything.
- Then call.
Oh yeah.
and what if he's there.
huh?
He says hello.
and where does that leave me?
- You are a disgrace to your people.
- Oh.
see-- See.
that is where you are wrong.
You know.
there's this whole myth it's easier when two guys are involved.
Totally untrue.
It is not so easy for a guy to meet another guy in this city.
It's raining men!
Hallelujah!
Great night at the clubs.
Jack was en fuego all night.
The lovelies were buzzing around me like Iike what?
Like moths to a flamer.
Actually.
more like fat to a Will is fat.
Oh.
touché.
Okay.
if you two are gonna play Bitchy McSnipe.
I'm gonna head back to my place.
I just don't understand why someone would subject themselves to a constant barrage of insults.
day after day.
Honey.
your new dump smells like cat pee.
Never mind.
- Hey.
poodle.
- Who's your daddy?
You are.
Sorry to get you up so early.
Karen.
Oh.
grow up.
honey.
I haven't been to bed yet.
I need to speak to both of you about Rosario.
Hey.
hey.
hey-- that's Mrs. Jack McFarland to you.
I thought you were Mrs. Jack McFarland.
And I thought you didn't have love handles.
I guess we're both wrong.
I got a call from my friend at the INS yesterday.
and apparently the marriage between a 30-year-old gay man and a post menopausal Salvadoran maid flagged something in their computer.
- Okay.
are we done yet?
- No.
Look.
they're gonna start making random visits to verify that Jack and Rosario are a real married couple.
So.
since their official residence is listed as your place.
I think the best thing would be for Jack to move into your penthouse.
- I just adore a penthouse view.
-  Ooh.
my very own sexless marriage.
Just like Will and Grace.
No.
not like Will and Grace.
We don't even live together anymore.
She's got her own apartment.
Eight dysfunctional feet away.
Lord.
they're like Siamese twins who are joined at their boring personalities.
Look.
Grace and I are now totally independent.
Separate homes.
separate lives.
separate-- Showering.
showering.
showering.
My Lord.
who Jiffy Popped her head?
Well This?
This is my penthouse view?
Did you say my name?
No.
I said.
"This is my penthouse view".
But I understand it sounds exactly like "Rosario".
You know.
you never talked to me this way before we were married.
Sorry.
Rosie.
I'm still a little tense about our conjugal bed.
Hey.
hey-- you're on the clock.
tamale.
Get to work.
Listen.
Iady.
I'll squash you like a wormy apple.
I hate it here.
Karen.
I want to be in the good part of the house with you.
Well.
that's sweet.
Jack.
But this is where the help stays.
But I'm not help.
Honey.
you married help.
you're help.
Oh.
and one other thing-- Stan sleepwalks.
So if you bump into him in the middle of the night and he puts the moves on you.
just go with it.
You might get a mink in the morning.
Hi.
Just wanted to get some pudding.
You got pudding at the market.
I didn't.
This is fat-free.
right?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Thanks.
bye.
Oh.
it's chocolate.
I thought I grabbed the swirl.
You know.
it's funny.
speaking of chocolate versus swirl.
I'm naked!
I'm devoid of clothing.
I'm in my nude.
I know.
you're so naked these days.
Since when did you start being naked all the time?
Well.
since I started living alone.
Hey.
just 'cause you're naked doesn't mean you have to be cheeky.
Bye.
Will.
Oh.
remind me to get you a bookmark.
Okay.
this isn't working.
Well.
what are you telling me for?
Talk to your urologist.
Thank you.
New York!
Maybe Jack and Karen were right.
maybe this moving across the hall hasn't solved our problem.
Will.
you just said Jack and Karen were right.
I want you to cut wheat out of your diet.
Come on.
Iook at you.
you're still totally dependent on me.
Why.
'cause I borrowed a pudding pack?
No.
Grace.
you borrow everything-- CDs.
books.
clothes.
You spent half of last night looking through my apartment for bubble bath.
- So?
- You don't have a tub.
I hope you're at least planning on buying that pillow a drink.
Grace.
do not deflect.
You can't do anything without me.
You can't have a bath.
you can't eat pudding.
God knows.
you can't even cook a meal without me.
Ha!
That was me laughing without you because I happen to be throwing a fabulous dinner party tomorrow night.
- You're not having a party.
- Oh.
but I am.
Perhaps you don't know about it 'cause you're not invited.
I'm not invited because there is no dinner party.
Grace.
Can't you see this arrangement isn't working?
You have to move.
And I don't mean across the hall.
and I don't mean to another floor.
You gotta move somewhere out there.
Okay.
now I'm confused.
Do you want me to move east or south?
Richard.
hi.
it's Will Truman.
Yeah.
Listen.
I just wanted to call and thank you for recommending that John Updike to me.
My favorite part?
Um when you smiled at me and said.
"Thanks for shopping at Borders".
Yeah.
well-- Iisten.
I just thought I'd call and see if maybe you wanted to have a drink with me.
Well.
great.
Hi.
I'm holding for Richard.
Oh.
oh.
hi.
Richard.
It's Will Updike-- Will Truman.
Will Truman.
not Will Updike.
I'm a "true man" not an "up dike".
Richard.
could you hold for a minute?
Idiot!
Hi.
So.
um Iisten.
you know when I was at Borders the other day.
and you thanked me.
I didn't say you're welcome.
And l-- pardon me?
Yes.
I would like to have a drink with you.
Tomorrow night would be good.
Okay.
I look forward to it too.
Bye.
Ow!
- Hi.
- Hi.
honey.
Great dress.
Where are Fred and Ethel?
Here.
I brought you a little housewarming gift.
Oh-- oh.
Oh.
thank you.
Thank you.
that was really sweet of you.
Oh.
a martini set.
And an open bottle of gin.
Oh.
Grace?
What.
um what is this about?
Okay.
you can stop with the hands of judgment.
I don't have any furniture yet.
so I thought it'd be kind of fun to have a picnic.
Oh.
I get it.
Kind of like Saratoga before the races.
Except there's no grass.
or trees and of course.
Saratoga doesn't smell like a litter box.
Actually.
it's just like the picnics I had growing up.
Watermelon.
apple pie.
drunken bitter Aunt Greta.
Karen.
can you just please try and have a good time?
Oh.
okay.
honey.
I'll try.
Oh.
this is gonna be a wonderful party.
a picnic!
All of Manhattan will be abuzz.
Speaking of Manhattans and a buzz  -  - Coming.
coming.
coming - Hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
This is for you.
Thank you.
Hi.
Come on in.
come on in.
So isn't it cute?
- It's so cute.
- So.
so cute.
Where's Will?
- Oh.
he's not coming.
- Oh.
- Did you guys get into a fight?
- No.
So.
I don't get it.
He's in his apartment.
and I'm in mine.
- throwing a dinner party.
- Oh.
Who cooked?
I did.
She cooked.
Rob.
So.
uh.
is Will coming later?
Karen: Oh, for God's sake, it's just gonna be the four ofus.
Grab a bottle, hunker down and pray for daylight!
Does this go with this?
Does "no" go with "way"?
Okay.
you're no longer helping.
Out.
I don't need you here doing a Joan and Melissa Rivers on me.
Oh.
Cybill.
what's with the gloves?
Did the eczema flair up again?
Out.
out.
out.
Now.
Will.
I understand you're anxious 'cause Grace isn't here to dress you and burp you.
But.
tonight's gonna be great.
I think it's fantastic you're getting out there again.
and watch.
you'll see.
everything's gonna be just fine.
Hello?
Oh.
hi.
Richard.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
that's fine.
I'll be here.
take your time.
- He's just running a little late.
- Ooh.
Ouch.
Wow.
You okay?
What do you mean am I okay?
Why wouldn't I be?
Tsk.
tsk.
tsk.
Will.
have you totally forgotten how to speak our language?
"Running late" is gay for "I'm blowing you off".
Really?
What's gay for "Get out"?
That would be "Good morning".
Good morning.
Jack.
So how's the soup?
Everyone loving the soup?
- It's a little cold.
- It's gazpacho.
It's supposed to be cold.
Okay.
it's bad.
- Honey - What.
what do you want me to say?
You want me to lie to her like I did about the hors d'oeuvres?
- Honey-- - No.
it's okay.
it's okay.
I mean.
the most important thing is that everyone's having fun.
Honey.
what's the second most important thing?
Oh.
ahh.
Do you have a chair?
Sitting on the floor.
really bad for his back.
Yeah.
I'm like the AI Pacino of back problems.
- Sciatica.
sciatica.
-  Rob!
- Oh.
God!
- Rob!
Good Lord.
where'd you find these two?
You know what.
I bet we can borrow a chair from Will.
No!
No.
no.
no.
We don't need Will.
I'll make a chair.
I'll make a chair.
I'll just-- Iook.
Iook.
Iook.
I'll just throw a sheet over this box Look.
we're having fun.
We're improvising.
We're draping.
see?
And we're sitting.
And we just located my missing Waterpik.
Grace.
you're stuffed in a box getting rid of ass plaque.
Take it as a sign.
This evening is a bust.
It's not.
Honey.
honey.
it's over.
okay?
You never had a chance in hell without Wilma.
Now.
you know I've never been a big fan of Will's.
but let's face it.
the girl knows how to entertain.
okay?
Right?
Am I right?
Obviously.
I know how to entertain.
- What's that smell?
- It's cat pee!
A cat has peed.
the entire apartment is soaked in cat urine.
okay?
Smells like rosemary.
Oh.
that's the chicken.
Excuse me-- - Oh.
thank God.
Will!
- Will!
Will!
Hi.
how are you?
Good to see you.
- Hi.
hi.
- Will.
what are you doing here?
I just-- I just need to talk to you.
I had a date with the Borders guy and he called to say he's running late.
That was an hour ago.
Is that some kind of code for he's blowing me off?
Will.
excuse me.
but you're gonna have to leave.
'cause I'm in the middle of a very lovely dinner party with my friends.
Put down the cheese and return to the picnic area!
Grace?
Did you hear me?
I really need to talk.
I'm sorry.
you need to leave.
'cause I'm about to serve the entrée.
- I'm just asking for a little advice.
- No.
you asked for an independent life.
And that's what you have now.
so go home.
read in the nude and play with your pudding.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know.
I've been thinking and maybe you're right.
you know?
About me being too close and not being independent.
and No.
no.
I was crazy that day.
All I'd had for lunch was Bugles.
- So I didn't-- - No.
no.
You were right.
this across-the-hall thing.
it was a bad idea.
So tomorrow I'm gonna wake up.
I'm gonna get the paper.
and I'm gonna start looking for a place somewhere - out there.
- Grace.
you don't have to do that.
No.
I do.
I do.
I mean.
I can deal with the occasional bad dinner party.
- Awful.
by the way.
- Mmm.
I blame the ghost of Little Kitty Pee-a-lot.
But if me living this close is turning into some sort of crutch for the both of us.
then it isn't working.
- And I should-- - You-- Mind if I take that?
I'm starving.
Hi.
- Or maybe it is working.
- I'll call you.
- He's cute.
Is he funny?
- Gotta go.
Okay.
call me.
call me.
No.
wait.
he's a cutie.
Did I interrupt?
Am I about to interrupt?
Bye bye.
Grace.
I'll tell you everything over breakfast.
Love you.
I'm going to Costco tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Socks.
The kind with the ball on the end.
or the plain tubes?
Sweetie.
you choose.
it's six of one.
I like a tube sock on a man.
Me too.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Who was a good boy at the doctor.
huh?
Who was a pretty bird at the doctor?
And who got the pretty doctor's phone number?
Yes.
Pretty bird.
pretty bird.
Jack.
I've got a tenant's meeting in five minutes.
I don't want to have to deal with a lot of shrill squawking.
feathers flying.
biting.
and that bird has got to go too.
-  - I'm not too fond of the tie either.
That's our cue.
Guapo.
Oh.
Iook.
Will.
I'm flipping you the bird.
Uh.
Grace.
a little tip-- when you shadow.
a good rule of thumb is less is more.
Okay.
All I wanted to do was spend a cozy evening at home by myself.
So I try to light a fire and the next thing I know.
the entire apartment is full of smoke.
- Did you check the flue?
- Yeah.
- Did you use dry wood?
- Yeah.
Did you know your fireplace has been sealed.
effectively rendering it non-functional?
- No.
- Might be your problem.
- Why is it sealed shut?
- Three years ago we were bringing the fireplaces up to code.
and it got too expensive.
So.
now some of them work and some of them - How come your fireplace works?
- Because I'm sleeping with the president of the tenant's association.
- That's you.
- Yes.
and I'm tender but rough when I need to be.
Okay.
Mr. Rough and Tender.
you have to do something.
How can I have a groovy bachelorette makeout pad if I don't have a little fire to set the mood?
Smoke in bed.
I have a tenant's meeting.
this discussion is closed.
Not unlike your fireplace.
Wait.
wait.
why is this discussion closed?
- Give me one good reason why.
- Uh 'cause?
I'm gonna need a little more than that.
Okay.
because.
Come on.
- This isn't fair.
- Well.
Iife's not fair.
Grace.
Grow up.
Whoa.
Did you just tell me to grow up?
Yes I did.
And when you grow up.
you'll understand.
- What are you doing?
- You're having a tenant meeting.
I'm a tenant with an issue.
You're a tenant with a lot of issues.
Okay.
all in favor?
Opposed?
It's decided then.
a shirt must be worn when using the laundry room.
- I just don't understand-- - It's over.
Mr. Zamir.
- But it's 1.000°-- - Mr. Zamir!
All right.
now the carpets are being cleaned next week.
Iight bulbs replaced in the stairwell.
Anything else?
Anybody?
Mrs. Pressman.
Somebody stole my umbrella.
Is this a new umbrella.
or is this the same umbrella we discussed July 28th.
August 28th.
and the September 10th special umbrella meeting?
It's very similar to the one Tim Kaiser in 12B has.
is all I'm saying.
Duly noted.
Okay.
is there anything else?
Well then.
I move this meeting be adjourned.
All in favor?
Hello?
My hand has been up for like an hour.
I'm down three ring sizes.
- Grace-- - Thank you.
Hi.
I'm Grace Adler.
9A.
I'd like to talk about fireplaces.
Now as I understand it.
some of them work and some of them don't.
I'd like to find a way to get them all working.
- I thought none of them worked.
- Ah!
No.
Some of them do indeed work.
The rest are sealed shut.
Do any of them work?
That's what I just said.
some of them work.
some of them don't.
I'd like a fire but he won't let me.
You want heat.
here's an idea.
Iight your mother on fire.
I would like a fireplace.
Where would we get the wood?
You see what you started?
Hey.
people.
people.
People.
now listen.
we settled this.
We could have all had our fireplaces brought to code.
but then our maintenance fees would have gone up and I just assumed nobody would want that.
Uh.
interesting how he made that assumption just after his own fireplace was done.
Thank you.
thank you.
Now.
now.
now.
now look.
we had just voted an increase.
so that we could have the lobby floors done and that's it.
That's what we decided on.
Trust me.
it's what you wanted.
Okay?
Meeting adjourned.
Whoa.
Whoa.
whoa.
whoa.
Sit.
Sit.
sit.
sit.
Sit.
Sit.
- Mr. Zamir.
- But I want to go-- Mr. Zamir.
Now are you people noting this arrogance?
He's not your president.
He's not acting like a president.
He's acting like a king.
- Or in his case-- - All right.
Grace.
they get the point.
All I'm saying is we can't all have fireplaces.
- See?
He's doing it again.
- Okay.
you know what?
Enough.
- Everybody wants to go home.
- I don't think we're done here.
Oh.
we're done here.
Good night.
everybody.
Elections are next week.
but since I'm running unopposed again.
sign the ballot.
don't sign it.
whatever you want.
- Will: Good night.
- Wait.
not so fast.
Hey.
hey.
Hey!
I think you're all going to be surprised to see another name on that ballot.
Me.
me!
I'm running for board president.
Everybody: Ohh!
Hold still.
Claus von Puppy.
We're accessorizing.
Ooh.
Iook at you.
all "street".
You're like Notorious D-O-G.
I'm the pooch with the cold wet snout lf you sniff my butt then I'll ask you out Word to the bitch.
I told you to keep that dog off the bed.
I made it once today.
I don't want to make it again.
Rosario.
a marriage is about compromise and compassion.
okay?
Maybe you could.
oh.
I don't know.
pick one?
Dogs rapping.
strange boys calling in the middle of the night.
When I prayed to the Madonna for a husband.
maybe I should have been more specific.
Oh my God.
you pray to Madonna too?
Jack.
sweetie.
uh we need to talk.
There's something that-- oh.
it's you.
If I understand our roles correctly.
you should be cleaning something.
and I should be drinking something.
Freshen.
Drinking at 10:00 in the morning.
Where I come from we have a word for people like you.
Oh.
that's funny.
We have a word for people like me here.
too.
It's called boss.
Now do what I tell you.
Honey.
sit down.
I need to talk to you.
Okay.
Iisten.
Sometimes bad things happen to good people.
And sometimes bad things happen to you.
I'm not following.
Oh screw it.
Bird is gone.
Guapo.
something happened to Guapo?
Well.
I opened the window to yell at somebody on the street for wearing palazzo pants.
and before I could say.
"Hey.
Ioser".
bird took off.
You mean-- oh my God.
That bird was my life.
we've been through everything.
When Steve dumped me.
Guapo was there.
When Raoul dumped me.
Guapo was there.
Mike.
Dan.
Tom Guapo.
Guapo.
Guapo there.
there.
there.
Oh.
honey.
what can I do?
Do you want another bird?
No.
how can you even ask me that?
If my grandmother died.
would you bring me another racist dowager with a purse full of diabetic candy?
I don't think so.
Guapo was my baby.
- Oh.
Jack-- - Leave me alone!
Oh.
you know.
uh when I get depressed nothing perks me up like a little spending spree.
- Come on.
honey.
Iet's go shopping.
- I don't want to.
- We'll go to Barneys.
- It won't help.
- We'll skip the sale rack.
- I don't know.
I'll let you French kiss me in the elevator.
- Well.
maybe just an hour.
- Come on.
come on.
Now get yourself together and I'm gonna go and give driver a B12 shot.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Oh, what the hell, honey.
While we're out, maybe I'll buy you a new Rolex.
Coming.
Wait.
hold the door.
hold the door!
Hold the door-- oh!
-  - Ow.
ow.
ow.
ow.
ow-- Grace!
"Vote for Grace.
Win the Race".
That's cute.
Shouldn't the rhyme go more like.
"Vote for Grace.
she just wants to get it on in front of a fireplace"?
Oh.
Will.
I am so far beyond the fireplace.
I'm doing this because your arrogance is off the charts and someone's got to bring you down a peg.
And that someone is you?
Allow me to turn up my nose and laugh, French-like at you.
Will.
you can't win all the time.
Really.
I can't?
'Cause it seems like I pretty much have my whole life.
Sorry.
I saw how much you enjoyed that the first time.
Laugh all you want.
Gerard Depar-doo-doo.
'Cause when they tally the votes.
the person who laughs last is gonna be the last person laughing.
Don't act like that didn't make sense.
Grace-- Iook.
I don't want to play these games with you.
okay?
The tenants love me.
face it.
You don't stand a chance.
- Hi.
Mrs. Pressman.
- Save it.
Will Truman.
I'm voting for Grace.
She told me how you've been eating my fruit-of-the-month.
Wait.
what-- I-- I-- I ate a Japanese pear.
Once.
And you were in Boca.
Thief.
You're a thief.
- I'm voting for Grace.
- But-- Nice.
nice.
Grace.
What?
Smearing my name with the tenants?
Hey.
she asked me what time it was and it just came up.
- I think these tactics are pathetic.
- Yeah?
Well.
"All is fair in love and war".
Now.
that shopping spree helped a little bit.
didn't it.
poodle?
- I guess.
- Oh.
come on.
I saw you crack a smile when I had that salesgirl fired.
Oh.
but I've got six children and my husband just left me.
Come on.
I saw you.
you little devil.
I saw.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Iook at Guapo's cage.
It's so empty.
Iike my heart.
Oh.
keep your chin up.
Tomorrow.
we'll talk travel.
Oh.
say.
have you done Greece?
Oh.
wait a minute.
of course you've done Greece.
No.
we'll think of something.
Living in a material world 'Terial.
oh.
in a material world And I am a mater-- You again?
Oh my God.
I'm Tippi Hedren.
Get out of here.
go.
shoo!
Shoo!
Shoo.
shoes.
That's what I can get tomorrow.
I am rather fond of the new Gucci mule.
Wait a minute.
what am I saying?
You're my Guapo.
you're my baby.
Come here.
Guapo.
Yes Guapotito.
Now look at me.
Am I the sort of man that would give up his precious little baby for a $10.000 watch?
Now Guapo.
the closet's not that bad.
Will was in there for 20 years.
- Mrs. Carr.
a lemon square?
- How about a flashlight?
They're yummy!
- Vote for me in the election.
- Vote for experience.
I've been do-- I thought you had nothing to worry about Frenchie.
That's Mr. French to you.
Oh.
my eye.
Gracie.
you okay?
Pretty shoes Pretty shoes Who's a pretty pair of Prada slip-ons?
Oh.
you are.
Yes.
you are.
- I don't feel right.
- Ohh.
Guapo!
I just feel terrible about the last few days.
trying to make up for the loss of a pet by buying you stupid little gifts.
No.
no.
the gifts aren't stupid.
The gifts help.
No.
honey.
it's wrong.
in fact it's-- it's just insulting.
There's only one thing I can give you that-- that has real value.
- Your love?
- A boat!
Oh my God.
Karen.
I don't know what to say.
Say.
"Thank you.
Karen".
Thank you for a boat with a mahogany deck.
a cruising speed of 40 knots.
and a staff of cabin boys who are either gay or questioning.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
it's one out of every 10 man's dream.
I've never-- nobody's ever-- you know.
I don't-- oh God.
Karen.
I can't keep it up.
I've been lying to you this whole time.
- I know.
- Guapo's in the closet right-- -  - Wait a minute.
you know?
- How?
- Poor.
naive Jack.
You really think there's an inch of this place I can't see on video?
There.
there.
there and there.
Oh my God.
Karen.
I don't know what to say.
Say hi to Stan.
Hello.
Mr. Walker.
So I guess I should give you the keys back.
No.
keep 'em.
They're to Grace's office.
Go ahead.
help yourself.
take whatever you want.
I'm so ashamed.
Karen.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
A part of me is angry.
but a part of me is proud.
The rest of me is just drunk.
Wait a minute-- if you've got cameras everywhere.
does that mean you've seen-- Yes I have.
honey.
and good for you.
"L".
"L" stands for loyalty.
That's what Grace Adler is all about.
"E".
"E" stands for no more smells in the elevator.
"R".
responsibility.
- So in conclusion - Arthur.
wake up.
she's concluding.

Pick change.
Pick me.
Pick.
pick.
pick.
pick.
pick.
pick.
Change is bad.
Vote for me.
Okay.
everyone.
fill out your ballots.
Nice artwork.
by the way.
What are you talking about?
My poster in the elevator?
You blacked out my teeth.
gave me a mustache.
horns.
an arrow through the head.
- Real mature.
-  - What?
- All I did was the teeth.
You're just afraid you're gonna lose.
Why don't you choke down another tainted lemon square?
- Flashlight lawyer-liar.
- You're a mess.
Okay.
everyone.
attention.
Counting the absentee votes.
it looks like - 18 for Grace - Yes!
- and 18 for Will.
- No!
What is wrong with you people?
I had buttons and posters.
and baked goods.
That's only 36.
- Who didn't vote?
- Wait.
I didn't vote.
- I win!
- Wait.
wait.
you voted.
you banana.
Mr. Munitz.
I forgot.
He's in St. Luke's Hospital for a hernia operation.
What are we going to do?
- Is anybody else hot in here?
- Mr. Zamir!
I guess we'll just have to wait till he gets out.
I guess so.
- Get-- move!
- Stop it!
Telling the nurse you're his daughter.
- That's beyond contemptible.
- Oh.
Rabbi Truman I'm glad you found him.
Mr. Munitz?
It's me.
Grace Adler.
I'm running for board president.
Why?
Good question.
"G" is for good government.
"R" is for re-decorate the lobby.
- "A" is for-- - "A" is for you're being an ass.
The man is unconscious.
he doesn't want to hear your campaign promises.
particularly since I've been doing such a good job for four years.
Squeeze my hand if you agree.
-  - Shh.
wait.
he's waking up.
Mr. Munitz?
Hi.
hi.
you're looking really good.
by the way.
We need your vote for board president.
Who do you want?
Will Truman who's served you faithfully for four years?
Or Grace Adler.
who blames you for the smell in the elevator?
Uh.
wait.
you know what?
This just isn't fair.
The man is heavily medicated.
- and he's in no condition-- - I like Grace.
Yes!
Yes!
I win.
you lose I win.
I win.
you lose You lose.
I win.
you lose.
you lose-- yeah.
me!
Second verse.
same as the first - I win.
you lose - All right.
all right.
all right.
Put your pom-poms down.
Tiffany Amber Annoying.
- I concede.
- Mmm.
- You lose.
You lose.
- Yeah.
but I lose.
I love losing.
- How's it feel?
- Not so good.
Oh.
how the arrogant have fallen.
Especially when I think about all I'm losing.
Like waking up at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow to let the gas guy in.
Or next week's meeting with the city building inspector.
a man who's never met a clove of garlic he didn't like.
Or dealing with any one of 1.000 niggling little problems 24 hours a day.
from 36 neurotic tenants.
Wait.
that doesn't sound very fun.
Oh.
it's not.
And when I think of it that way.
suddenly losing feels a whole lot like winning.
Thank you.
Grace.
Thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson.
See ya.
-  - Quiet.
quiet.
Quiet!
Okay.
Iet's just take a breath.
Okay?
And then speak one at a time.
- Thank you.
-
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
So.
Jack.
you're still coming with me to pick up my new DVD player.
right?
Oh my God.
is that today?
What do I have today?
Um What exactly are you looking at?
Oh.
I'm just going over my schedule.
Uh nope.
sorry.
can't squeeze you in.
I mentioned that with DVD you can watch porn from any angle?
Oh.
Iook my schedule just opened up.
Hmm.
I wonder what's in the paper today?
Let's see.
War.
famine the computer I bought a month ago is now half the price.
and on the front page of the Arts section-- oh my God.
it's me!
- Let me see.
- Will.
Will.
Will-- buy me a computer.
I want one in tangerine to match the shoes you're going to get me later.
I think you missed the point of Grace's entrance.
Let me see that.
Uh "From Warehouse to Our House.
the Transformation of a Tribeca Loft".
- Get to me.
get to me!
- Oh.
yeah.
all right.
"Manhattan interior designer Grace Adler.
26--" Must have been a typo.
More like a lie-o.
Grace.
this is great.
There's a picture and everything.
- Look at that gorgeous face.
- Look at the leather pants.
Look at those massive jugs.
Yeah.
what's going on there?
What are you talking about?
My jugs.
Iook exactly like they do in the picture.
They definitely don't.
No.
I mean these are like five times the size.
Maybe it was the angle the photograph was taken.
You know.
King Kong was only eight inches tall.
See look.
Iet me show you.
Here-- and I'm a gay man.
so this means nothing.
This is how big yours are.
see?
Whereas the picture gives the illusion of like.
this-ness.
- You're crazy.
- Grace.
Iet me see now.
I am also a gay man.
so this means nothing.
Yeah.
Will's right.
these are definitely smaller.
Oh my God.
I just got to second with Grace.
I guess they do look a little huge-esque.
Do me.
See how big mine are.
- Jack.
no.
- Come on.
you got felt up.
Okay.
but I'm a straight woman.
so this means nothing.
Okay.
Someone's been working out.
Guilty.
Hey.
hey.
Gracie.
while you're giving it away over there.
you know?
- Huh?
- Now these are some knockers.
Thank you.
Okay.
this just got weird.
Hi.
Oh.
Iook.
it's the dynamic duo.
Oh.
and Will.
So.
you've seen the picture?
Yeah.
honey.
what happened there?
Oh.
Grace.
you got a call from a guy.
it was about a person.
or a place.
or a thing.
It was something.
Okay.
that's a start.
We know a human being called regarding a noun.
Oh.
devil.
I wrote it down here somewhere.
Let's see.
what was l-- oh.
I was putting on my face when-- oh.
there it is.
there.
John Gregorio called?
Oh my God.
no way.
He's such a fox!
Good Lord.
a pack of cigs and a pregnancy scare and this could be high school.
John Gregorio was high school for me.
Even though he wouldn't give me the time of day.
Anyway.
I heard he's an artist now.
he must have-- he must have seen the article and liked what I did with the loft.
Yeah.
the loft.
Gotta be the loft.
Hey.
the guy is an artist.
he was just responding to an aesthetic.
Yeah.
the aesthetic of your giant hooters.
Will is right.
honey.
Mr. High School called because he thinks you're stacked.
Now.
if you actually were.
you would understand the effect that they have on men.
but alas.
Mother Nature did not bless you as she did me.
Said the woman whose frown lines were filled with ass fat.
- Bye bye.
- Grace: Bye.
- I'm gonna call him.
- All right.
don't be too chatty.
just make your breasts sound big.
John?
Hi.
it's Grace Adler.
How are you?
It has been a really long time.
Yes.
yes.
that was a loft I did about a month ago.
I'm very proud of it.
Oh.
yes.
that was me in the picture.
- Bingo.
- What?
Oh.
I would love to.
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Okay.
He's part of a group show at the Zellman Gallery.
and he invited me.
- What?
- He thinks you've got big melons.
So.
if I were you.
Grace.
I would figure out a way to turn those "honey don'ts" into some "honey do's".
Jack.
can I get some help here.
please?
I think I'm gonna bring back paisley.
That's so funny that you mentioned paisley because-- do something!
I think you're sitting on the remote.
- Why is there an earring in your sofa?
- It's probably Grace's.
It looks just like the skull earring I gave my old boyfriend Walter.
Uh-- well.
I don't-- It looks like a pretty common skull.
I had a "W" engraved on it.
you know.
for "Walter".
Isn't that sweet?
Oh.
Iook.
this one has an "M".
J-Jack.
it's not what you think.
You fooled around with my Walter.
Okay.
it is what you think.
But-- but.
Jack!
Jack.
he wasn't your Walter at the time.
You know.
I mean.
you'd broken up long ago.
You know he was-- he was Walter-up-for-grabs.
So l-- I grabbed.
you know?
- How could you?
- I-- it was one time.
Commandment number one in the Gay Bible: Thou shalt not covet my ex's ass.
Jack-- is that from the Book of Gene-sissy?
That is so funny.
That's it.
goodbye.
- Jack.
Jack?
- Sinner!
Well.
you couldn't be that angry.
you barely even slammed the door.
Hey.
honey.
how you makin' out with the fake boobies?
This is crazy.
I don't need this.
Yeah.
whatever.
honey.
just bring out the floatin' fun bags.
See?
This is ridiculous.
I look like a ski resort.
Look at you.
honey.
Look.
Iook.
Iook.
You're all grown up.
Oh Leave it to a man to invent a bra filled with water.
Come on.
everybody in your condition wears them.
They make objects appear larger than they really are.
Okay.
now let's buy that puppy and get the hell out of here.
No.
no.
I don't want this.
I don't want lingerie that a gold fish could live in.
Look.
I feel completely comfortable the way I am.
- John likes me for me.
-  Oh.
honey.
I'm tellin' ya.
you should do stand up.
That's good.
Karen.
he does.
Yeah.
okay.
Well.
then let me ask you one question.
Um.
did John Gregorio have a girlfriend in high school?
Yeah.
Judy Lombardozzi.
Judy Lombardozzi.
Okay.
and let me guess.
was her nickname.
um "Slutty Big Boobs"?
No.
It was Judy "Lombar-look-at-d'em-dozies".
I'll take one in every color.
Hi.
how are you?
What?
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.
Oh.
what a coincidence.
I've been trying to ignore you all day.
That is so funny.
And you might want to talk to your wife about the quality of her snacks.
There's nothing in her fridge but batteries and mayonnaise.
See ya.
wouldn't want to be ya.
You're stealing food from her now?
I'm hurt.
- You're hurt?
- Jack.
come on.
give me a break.
I left 32 "I'm sorrys" on your answering machine.
And even one "I'm saw-wy".
Come on.
I just shopped at Balducci's.
I'll go in.
But only to grab a Balance Bar and some chicken.
then I've gotta go.
- Jack-- - Excuse me.
in a rush.
I meeting Rory at the Mandy Bar.
You remember Rory.
Yeah.
he's the friend that never slept with any of my boyfriends.
Jack.
if I'm supposed to stay away from every guy you've ever slept with.
that would leave me with women.
For your information.
Will.
Walter was the love of my life.
Oh.
you've said that about each Backstreet Boy at one time or another.
Besides.
you guys only went out for what.
a month?
Yeah.
and then he dumped me.
You remember what that feels like.
huh?
It hurts.
I had no idea.
You never mentioned it.
Oh.
how often do you talk about Michael?
Oh.
that's right.
all the time.
because you're so self-absorbed.
But me.
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve.
Okay.
I get it.
I screwed up.
What-- what is this gonna cost me?
Not much.
Just a friend.
Jack-- I know you're not that angry 'cause you didn't slam the door.
Slam the door.
Jack.
Jack?
Oh.
I'm so sorry that I'm late.
But l-- Hello.
kitties.
- What's with that?
- It's a Hydra Bra.
Water-filled for extra perkiness.
You would not believe the day I've had.
Guys whistling at me.
shouting lewd comments.
It was fantastic.
Sweetie.
you don't need those.
You're perfect.
Yeah.
but.
you know.
I just-- I wanted to look good for John.
Hey.
all I'm saying is you do what you have to do to make yourself feel a little more attractive.
Well.
I just want to go on record as saying it is wrong to lie.
By the way.
I told Jack that Cher is gonna be here tonight.
Cher's here.
No.
No.
I just told him that so he'd come here to meet Walter.
- Who's Walter?
- I told you this-- God.
do the boobs make you dumber?
I'm gonna go look at myself in the mirror again.
Cher?
Cher?
Cher!
Hi!
Oh.
sorry.
Where is she?
What's she wearing?
Gypsies.
tramps and thieves Jack.
Jack.
Jack.
She's not here yet.
Now just calm down and have an hors d'oeuvre.
Hey.
don't get so chummy.
I ain't sure I'm liking you yet.
Karen.
watch.
Welcome to my world.
honey.
And thank you for inviting me.
No.
but seriously.
Karen.
I mean.
you just-- you really took an interest and I want to tell you how much I appreciate it.
Well.
Grace.
you know.
we joke a lot.
but when you get right down to it-- - There's John.
get lost.
- Ahh!
Grace Adler.
I can't believe it.
I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.
- Wow.
Look at you.
John Gregorio.
Look.
I got to go play host for a few minutes.
I'll find you.
We'll be here.
I'll be here.
Oh my God.
I think he likes me.
- Thank you so much.
Karen.
- Okay.
okay.
Push me again and you die.
Oh.
oh wait.
honey.
I think you're caught on my brooch.
Oh.
I got it.
Okay.
there you go.
Oh my gosh.
his art is amazing.
Look at that.
Oh my God.
- Will.
what are you doing?
- I think you've sprung a leak.
What are you talking about?
I haven't been with a woman in some time.
but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to do that.
Oh my God.
Good Lord.
why don't you two get a room?
Oh my God.
okay.
just start walking.
okay?
Okay.
we've got to get out of here before we see-- John!
Hi!
Hi.
Old friend.
haven't seen him in a long time.
So.
John.
how's your show?
Will.
I got this.
- Good luck.
- Okay.
I-- I didn't get a chance to give you a proper hello.
Did you get some champagne?
No.
no.
but that's okay.
that's okay.
Oh.
no.
you gotta have a glass.
It's my opening.
Thank you.
To old friends.
who should have gotten together earlier.
What are you doing?
Why are you drinking like that?
Oh.
it's just-- it's just I'm just-- I'm just blown away by your-- by your watercolors.
It's just like whoa!
- Will you excuse me for just one-- - Wait a second.
Why are you trying to get away from me?
Okay.
John.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We live in a deeply patriarchal society.
in which women are unfairly judged by-- ugh.
My boobies are fake.
And broken.
I'm wearing the Hydra Bra.
Why?
Why would you do that?
Well.
I just-- the picture made me look you know.
and I thought that you would maybe like it because.
I mean.
after all you did go out with Judy Lombardozzi.
Judy Lombardozzi had a beautiful soul.
Come on.
give me a little credit.
I mean.
Grace.
I called you because I thought you were talented and creative.
I am talented and creative.
Did you see the way that I drank the champagne?
I'm sorry.
Grace.
but I'm looking to be with somebody who's a little more secure and a little less shallow.
Hello.
You look like you have a beautiful soul.
Hey.
that's not my soul you're looking at.
I think you improved them.
You know.
they're moodier.
I'm glad you like them.
'cause you're getting them for Christmas.
- How you feeling?
- Mmm.
A little deflated.
Oh God.
what was I thinking?
I look fine the way I am.
Why didn't you believe me when I said that?
Well.
'cause you're too close.
You're gay.
You're my best friend.
You're gay.
You love me.
- You're gay.
- Hey.
hey.
hey.
There was a time when I was a boob man.
Of course it ended when my mom switched to formula.
Okay.
it's 10:00 and no Cher.
Unless you can turn back time.
I'm very.
very angry.
Jack.
she's not coming.
I told you that to get you down here.
Hmm.
Okay.
just give me a minute here.
How dare you play the Cher card?
And why do I keep falling for it?
How dare you?
I know.
I know.
but I've got something that's going to make you even happier.
Inconceivable.
Fool me once.
shame on me.
Fool me twice you're thinning on top.
Goodbye.
Jack.
Jack.
I tracked down Walter.
He's coming here tonight.
Shut up.
What did he say?
He said that he's still single.
and he's still living in New York.
and he's dying to see you.
Shut up.
shut up.
Oh my God.
you're the best friend in the world.
And he just walked in.
How do I look?
Am I swimming in these pants 'cause they're yours.
You look fine.
Jack.
Okay.
now go get him and bring him to me.
Bring him to-- what is this 1810?
- Walter?
- Hi.
Will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Jack.
sorry I'm late.
- Walter.
- Wow.
you look great.
Thank you.
so do you.
Would you just excuse us.
just for a second?
- What?
- That's Walter?
Yeah.
the love of your life.
Okay.
don't get angry at me.
but I was totally thinking of somebody else.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
I'm going to say this because I love you.
Your disproportionately large head gives you a marionette-like quality.
What do you think of my eyes?
Two words.
major surgery.
The fact that you can see the white the entire way around the eyeball.
makes you look a little crazy.
And I say that with love.
- Puppet head.
- Crazy eyes.
Ahh!
I'm not gonna-- I just can't believe she just-- no!
So your mom called?
One message from her and I am completely insane.
Really?
Can you see the white all the way around your eye?
Come on.
Will.
he's right here.
Thank you.
Lord and Lady Hateful.
Now.
if you'll excuse me.
I'm going to return to a world of polite people with normal-sized heads.
Come on.
Jack.
he's right here.
So how many verses did she leave on your machine?
I'm coming to town I wanna have lunch with you and Will And I'm bringing Andy Fellner.
Another one of her famous fix ups.
Can you believe her?
Maybe this one will be cute.
you know?
It's got to be better than the guy she found on "nicejewishchiropractors.com".
I doubt it.
I went to camp with Andy Fellner.
Three years in a row we did the recreation of Noah's Ark.
And three years in a row Andy was cast in the role of Woodchuck #2.
His one line was.
"Ft-ft-ft-ft-ft-ft" Who were you?
- Noah's wife.
- Oh.
very nice.
Who'd you sleep with to get that?
- Will.
I was 11.
- Oh.
Although I did French kiss Yak #1 behind the canteen.
- He was good.
- You know what they say.
once you go yak.
you never go back.
Ooh!
I want this!
Yes!
They have it!
Cher!
It takes time to move on I need love to feel strong.
Cher.
I was-- I don't think so.
She's so over.
right?
Love you.
Uh.
eeny.
meeny.
miney.
Britney!
- We met in SoHo.
- It was the Village.
- Gay pride?
- "Wigstock".
Ah.
yes.
I remember it well.
- In a cage.
- On a box.
- Vodka neat?
- On the rocks.
Ah.
yes.
I remember it well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
- Oh!
Oh!
-  Come on.
Jack.
We've got to get out-- what are you looking at.
Sideburns?
Never seen somebody with money and soap?
Come on.
come on.
Break time is over.
Karen.
I don't want to study anymore.
Can't I just wing it tomorrow at lmmigration?
No.
you have to convince them that you two are a real married couple or this one's gonna be spooning ceviche out of a bucket on a dusty soccer field back in Chimichangaville!
Listen.
Iady.
in my country.
I was a schoolteacher.
Yeah?
Well.
in this country.
you wash my bras.
- Listen.
señorita.
I could pick up - You better be careful what you say  a Brazil nut!
Oh.
Jack.
don't let 'em take my sunshine away.
I love my mommy!
Grace.
what are you doing?
You look like that guy on Third Avenue that tried to sell me his toothbrush.
I just want to have my speech ready for when my mom gets here.
I'm not gonna let her run my life anymore.
No more fix ups.
Grace Iook.
I'm sorry your mother causes you so much pain and embarrassment.
but you've got to look at it this way.
it's incredibly entertaining for me.
Does that help at all?
Will.
I know you don't understand these things because you have a normal repressed passive-aggressive.
panty-wearing mother.
But do you think maybe you could be just a teeny bit supportive?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Support can be beautiful.
I'm right here if you need an assist.
I feel good.
I feel calm.
I feel ready.
Can we go?
Oh.
too late.
The mothership has landed.
- 76 trombones led the big parade - Mom.
Mom-- - With 110 cornets close behind-- - Mom.
Mom you do realize that parade is only in your head?
Bobbi.
you are.
as always.
a vision.
Will.
if you were any more delicious.
I'd have to spread you on a cracker right here.
That was really nice for me.
How's my favorite daughter?
- Okay.
Mom.
- She's not really my favorite.
I say that to all my girls.
- It makes them feel special.
- Ah.
So.
Mom.
how's "The Music Man" going?
Dad said it opens next week.
Well.
excuse me.
it's "Music Person".
I'm starring as Professor Carol Hill.
If it's as half as good as your performance as Millie Lohman in Death of a Salesperson I'm so excited about this match.
You know.
Andy and Grace went to camp together.
Will.
Yes.
I heard.
Woodchuck #2.
Oh!
He was good.
Ft-ft-ft!
Oh!
He's here.
He's here.
Andy!
Look!
We're over here.
dear.
- Hi!
- Hello.
doll.
You remember Grace.
- Yeah.
hey.
Grace.
- Andy.
- Hi.
- This is Will.
- Hey.
Andy.
nice to meet you.
- Will.
Sit down.
sit down.
sit down.
sit down.
So.
Iast week.
Andy's mother called me and-- Mom.
Mom.
no.
no.
I've got to interrupt you 'cause there's something I want to say.
And.
Andy.
believe me.
this has absolutely nothing to do with you.
"Since the dawn of time.
parents and children have woven an uneasy rug with the twin strands of codependence and independence" Move it along.
Grace.
I'm in my late 40s.
Okay.
okay.
Mom.
What I am-- what I'm trying to say to you is that-- Andy.
I think you're a really great guy.
I think you're a really great girl.
- Grace-- - Mom.
no.
Let me finish.
Look.
How many times do we have to go through this?
I'm sure that Andy is a really great guy.
but.
but clearly.
he's not for me.
That's right.
Andy's here to meet Will.
Oh!
Well.
ain't that a kick in the head?
Will you excuse us a moment?
Grace.
could I see you over by the chutney bar?
- I don't really like chutney.
- It's not about the chutney.
I am not getting fixed up by your mother.
I'm sorry.
I know this is so embarrassing for you.
but look at it this way.
It's incredibly entertaining for me.
- I am not doing it.
Grace.
okay?
- That's fine.
I totally understand.
- But just-- just one thing.
- What?
- You have to.
- What?
You'll tell my mom how bad it is.
She'll believe you because.
well.
you didn't come out of her.
Don't-- ew-- don't.
And then she will finally realize what a bad matchmaker she is.
and she will stop fixing me up.
- Grace-- - Oh.
please.
please.
please.
please.
please?
Please?
Clearly.
I'm not gonna win this argument.
- Okay.
one date.
- Thank you.
Oh!
Besides.
I-- I may get to answer - the age-old question.
- What's that?
"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck"?
What are we doing here?
I'm missing "Nash Bridges".
You made a match between Will and Andy.
and the date's almost over.
so I just wanted you to be here so you could witness the fruits of your labor.
I don't think we should be here.
What if they want to come back for a little touchie-nookie-nicky?
Mom.
can I take you to my therapist?
Because he thinks I'm making you up.
What do the boys make out to these days?
Is it still Judy?
What are you smiling at?
You really think you have a knack for this.
don't you?
Even after you set me up with Stanley Fink the mortician.
Scott Barkey.
who had to touch everything 10 times.
then smell it.
You could've done a lot worse than Stanley Fink.
Mom.
he was a mortician.
He touched dead people.
and then cooked me short ribs.
But you know what?
Why take my word for it?
Why don't we just wait and see what Will has to say?
I think then maybe you'll know why I'm smiling.
That is one terrific woodchuck.
Uh.
Rosario.
what does Jack's father do?
Make people feel bad about who they are.
This is no time to be fooling around!
Karen.
she's right.
- Rosario.
you'll go in first.
- I need some water.
Again?
What are you.
snacking on a saltlick when I'm not looking?
Look.
Jack.
there goes my world.
There goes my everything.
Stop worrying.
She's just a maid.
Just a maid?
That's like saying that Pradas are just shoes.
or vodka is just a morning beverage.
Karen.
please.
the dramatics.
Don't you understand how she-- okay.
I am going to tell you something that I've never told anyone.
Rosario is my mother.
She is not your mother.
All right.
she's not my mother.
But.
sweet nectar of the gods.
nobody gets the Merlot out of my nylons like that little plantain.
- Karen.
- She runs the entire house.
She alphabetizes my medicine cabinet.
- She knows the ins and outs-- - Karen!
She's my friend!
She's not your friend.
Oh my God.
she is!
Wow!
Real feelings.
Are you okay?
Look.
Karen.
just leave everything to me.
I promise nothing will go wrong.
okay?
Okay.
I'll see Mr. and Mrs. McFarland now.
- Oh.
- Yes.
I remember him well.
The last guy I went out with wasn't a fix up.
He was more of a fixer-upper.
I used to call him "This Old Boyfriend".
Hi.
Andy.
Will.
I'm sorry to bother you.
My latch.
it's stuck.
Can you do that trick you do to unstick it?
You know.
the whack.
the bang.
and the wiggle-wiggle-waggle?
I'm really sorry you had to hear that.
- Excuse me.
- That's okay.
"Whack.
bang.
wiggle-wiggle"?
- It was code.
- For what?
I'm 12?
You sold me out.
Grace.
go to bed.
You've obviously had a very busy day of crazy.
No.
I don't think so.
You were supposed to be proving a point to my mother.
not sharing a nice evening with someone.
This completely flies in the face of my master plan!
Master plan?
What are you.
"Simon Bar Sinister"?
- Grace.
I like him.
- Well.
cut it out!
Will.
you don't even know him.
For your information.
he sucked at tetherball.
Yeah!
Uh-huh!
He showered in his underwear.
and he once barfed s'mores all over the lodge.
But no.
Will has to go and find his good side.
When did you get to be so spiteful?
Guess what.
This isn't about you.
This is about me.
And if you have a problem with that.
then it's something you should take up with your pharmacist.
I'm going back to my apartment.
have a glass of wine.
some nice conversation.
and if all goes well.
a little "whack.
bang.
wiggle-wiggle".
Good night.
How could you not know he worked for the INS?
Don't they teach you anything in homo school?
So what kind of music does your husband like?
Well.
when he's doing butt-robics.
he likes 'N Sync.
But for the spinning class.
he prefers the oldies.
You know.
Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
Relax.
stop doing it.
Relax.
stop doing it.
And where did you two meet?
Hmm.
Iet me guess.
It was Boy Bar.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It was a blind date and we went to Arby's.
Okay.
Let's stop pretending.
I've gotten farther with your husband than you have.
I hope your bags are packed 'cause you're going back to EI Salvador.
Oh my God!
Honey.
they're sending her back!
Oh No.
they're not.
No one's going anywhere!
How dare you imply our marriage is a sham!
You're gay!
What.
a guy sleeps with guys.
and immediately he's pegged as gay?
Let me tell you a little something about the day I met Rosario.
I looked over the top of those half glasses into those big brown eyes.
and I knew from that moment love had found Jack McFarland.
Oh.
my cha-cha!
Rosario.
my love.
my life.
my all I adore you.
You had me at hola.
Good Lord.
You know you shouldn't look.
but there is a certain morbid fascination.
isn't there?
Sweetie.
I believe this is yours.
Now.
I've seen people desperate to be an American.
but that is desperate to be an American.
Fine.
You passed.
See you in six months.
We never met.
We won!
Oh.
honey.
you were magnificent!
And the light is back in my life.
Oh.
honey.
you know.
it's funny how-- sometimes you just don't realize how much you might miss something until it's almost gone.
Which reminds me.
I've got a Chanel suit at the dry cleaners and.
boy.
did I miss it!
Come on.
They close in an hour.
Move it or lose it!
Muy caliente.
Sorry for all these interruptions.
I promise Grace will not be coming back.
You want to watch some TV.
or do you want to save that for two years from now when we have nothing to say to each other?
Will.
there's something wrong with the door.
The chain's on.
Well.
that's because I couldn't weld it shut.
Hello.
hello.
hello.
hello.
hello--  Hey!
Hey!
Francis!
What is the number one rule in the Will and Grace rule book?
No white belts?
No.
Incorrect.
It's "God help the sister that comes between me and my mister".
You know.
even though I am not a superhero.
I can still hear you.
This is getting a little weird.
I think I should just go.
No.
this'll just take a second.
No.
Listen.
she obviously has a problem.
Why don't you figure out what it is and call me tomorrow?
From a secure location.
Unbelievable.
Oh.
Don't put this on me.
You screwed this up.
If you would've just stuck to the master plan-- Stop mentioning the plan.
There is no plan!
Don't say "master".
don't say "plan".
All I'm saying is.
if you had just told my mother that you hated Andy-- I don't hate Andy.
I like Andy.
Well.
Humphrey Bogart liked lngrid Bergman.
but he gave her up for the good of the Resistance.
Have you been swinging from power lines?
All I'm saying is.
if you had just followed the program.
formerly known as "The Master Plan".
- my mother would stop fixing me up!
- Grace.
Iet me ask you a question.
Has your mother fixed you up the whole time she's been here?
- No.
- Has she mentioned fixing you up?
- No.
- Do you get the impression - that a fix up is on the horizon?
- No.
- Then what's your damage.
heather?
- My damage?
- Yes!
Damage!
- My damage?
My damage is that she stop fixing me up!
Yeah.
I think that's a discussion between you and your mom.
I'm gonna go find Andy.
How did you get this nuts?
I guess we'll never know.
- I made him wait in the lobby!
- Thank you!
Mom.
have you given up on me?
Darling.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why did you stopped fixing me up?
Well.
Grace you told me to stop interfering in your life.
so I stopped.
Mom.
I've been saying that ever since you snuck falsies into my band uniform.
What's different now?
- I listen.
- You're a mother.
You're not supposed to listen.
Then what do you want me to do?
I don't want you to fix me up.
But I want you to want to fix me up.
I just don't want you to want me to want to go out with the guys that you want to fix me up with.
You know.
this rambling problem comes from your grandmother.
Honey.
whatever you said.
I promise I'll try.
- Thanks.
Mom.
- Oh.
the gays are so much easier!
I'm so sorry.
Well.
I'm sorry that-- I didn't do anything wrong.
God.
you've got me well trained!
Come here.
You two feel something when you hug?
Anything?
Because.
Will.
if you did.
it would make my life so much easier.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Psst-- I think I've done it.
By adding just a pinch of poblano, I've taken my recipe for Garlic Jazz, brought it south of the border, thereby creating Baja Jazz!
Shall we?
This must be what bad breath tastes like.
Must be all that jazz.
Everybody dance now!
Woo!
Those hips say someone had a good meeting with Harlin today.
That song says somebody hasn't been to a club in about 10 years.
I just closed the deal for Harlin to buy a cable company, which means, as his attorney, that I am now 10% of rolling in it.
Wow, congratulations.
And I thought I was having a good day 'cause a "shishlach" vendor hit on me.
Grace, this isn't about you.
Will and I are rich!
I think the first thing you're gonna buy me are colored contacts.
I need new eyes for fall.
Come on, Jack, you know the old saying-- give Jack a fish, he eats for a day.
Teach Jack to fish, he brings home a fisherman.
Is it warm in here, or what time is it?
Oh my God.
- That's not a Folex.
- Huh-uh.
Oh my God!
This is not "kashmere" with a K!
No.
That's cashmere with a "cash," as in, "I have tons of it"!
Okay, Will, you know that I'm happy for you, but remember there is a line between being enthusiastic and being obnoxious.
I call that line Richard Simmons.
You're right.
You're right.
I've gotta stay true to myself and not let this go to my head.
Speaking of which-- Everybody dance now!
Okay, so I'm at the ATM trying to get 20 bucks to get us some coffee, and it spits out this piece of paper that says, "Funds not available".
So I'm like, "I don't think so".
And the guy who lives under the envelope table starts giggling at me.
Anyway, I stick my card back in, and this time, it eats my card and tells me that I'm thousands of dollars overdrawn.
Thousands!
So no coffee?
No.
No coffee.
No ATM card.
No money.
And the worst part of it is the bank has me on video going like this-- "What the"?
Oh God.
Think.
How could this happen?
There must be an explanation.
Well, now, I just cashed all those little checks you've been giving me.
Could that be it?
- Your paychecks?
- Mmm.
You cashed your paychecks?
What?
Are you insane?
I thought we had an understanding-- you don't do any work, and in return, you don't cash your paychecks.
Honey, I had to.
Stan put me on a budget.
Ugh, that word.
I guess it was that hat that I bought last week that pushed him over.
Wait, Stan got upset because you bought a hat?
Well, the hat was in Geneva, and it wasn't really a hat, it was a ski lodge.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Okay.
Okay, maybe we can help each other out here.
How much does Stan want to give you?
He actually expects me to live on this.
Karen, I think you can learn to live on this.
I mean, Spain does, so Grace, they wear tires on their feet.
I wear Manolo Blahniks.
Okay, I'll tell you what-- Karen, my friend, you put that money back into my corporate account, and I will teach you how to live on a budget.
If this is what it means to live on a budget, then Oh, what the hell.
But I'm tellin' you right now, you start throwin' around words Iike Thom McCann and Red Lobster and the deal is off.
Hey, if I'm not gettin' paid-- - Grace Adler Designs.
- Hey, I gotta cancel lunch.
Why?
What are you gonna buy now, a goat?
What?
- Why a goat?
- It was a joke.
I mean, you already have everything else, so the only thing left would be a goat.
- That isn't really a joke.
- Okay, it was a bad joke, Will.
No, I gotta say it isn't a joke at all.
It doesn't fit any of the joke criteria.
A, it doesn't make sense, and B, there's nothing funny.
Okay, we're done.
Why are you blowing me off?
.
- I mean, maybe the word goat-- - Will.
Well, I gotta let some clients go, and it may take a while.
Why are you doing that?
'Cause of the Harlin thing?
Well, yeah.
He's 90% of my business now, and I've gotta devote all my energy to him.
So you know, time to trim a little fat.
And by fat you mean the people who took a chance on you when you were nobody and stuck by you through the good times and bad?
Yeah, fat.
I think I like you better when you were dissing my goat joke.
It wasn't a joke.
Good-baa-ah.
Will: I've got to let some clients go today, and I figured since you've been fired more than anyone, it kinda makes you an expert.
Actually, I've been fired from every job I've ever had.
What I figured is, they'd come in and l-- No, no, no, uneducated Rita, no.
Not here, you can't do it here.
They'll start weeping and wailing, even spitting, and the next thing you know security has to come remove me from the office.
- You mean my client.
- Yeah, that's what I said.
Anyway, here's what you do-- you call them up, ask them what their favorite lunch place is.
You're in public, so less chance of a scene.
Then you sit 'em down, order 'em a happy meal and can their ass.
-  - Woo!
A McFiring.
Favorite lunch place-- that's not a bad idea.
Yeah, that's how the library did it.
And my boss at the Swiss Colony.
And Nanna What have you done?
Aunt Honey just called me in tears.
Hey, I'm not the one that named her Aunt Honey.
You should have heard her.
"Will won't be my lawyer anymore.
I made him a cocoa 'fopurum,' and he drops me like a 'hahachuam'"?
A hachoo-what?
She was crying so hard I didn't catch the last word.
- How could you?
- Grace, you knew this was happening.
I just don't have time for these kind of people anymore.
- "These kind of people"?
- Grace, it's just business.
When I'm closing a multi-million dollar deal, I can't be fielding calls from a woman who wants to sue Entenmann's because she gained six pounds on their fat-free coffee cake.
Okay, I get it now.
If they don't bring in the cash, you just get rid of them, willy-nilly.
I told you never to call me that.
You know, you used to care about people.
Now you're just like a bad lawyer joke.
Like, "How many lawyers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
Two.
One to screw it in, and the other to--" Wait, three.
Wait.
I mean-- why can't I tell a joke today?
I'm sorry that you can't understand it, but this is the way business works.
- Not my business.
- That's because yourjob is shopping for pillows and tassels.
My God, a gay guy could do your job in his sleep.
Whoa.
You know, just because you are becoming the incarnation of pure evil, does not give you permission to take it out on me.
I'm trying to do whatever it takes to make my business go from here to here.
Yeah, and as a result, your morality has gone from here to here.
Funny, my interest in this conversation just went from here to here!
And your lips can go from here to here.
- Hello.
- Hey, Will, it's Harlin.
- Hey, Harlin.
- Listen, I was wondering if you got any free time tomorrow.
I'd like to get together.
Harlin, for my number one client, I've got nothing but time.
Good, good.
What's your favorite lunch place?
Harlin, I just don't want to see you make a big mistake.
You know I like you, but I've moved on to a different level now.
I need someone bigger.
It's not personal, it's strictly business.
I understand that and I know you said your mind's made up-- - It is.
My mind's made up.
- Right.
Right.
But imagine just for a second that it isn't.
Well, in order to do that, I would have to use my mind, and my mind's made up.
Well, I guess there's no arguing with frontier logic.
All right.
That's-- that's your decision, and I have to respect it.
Thank you, Will.
I'm gonna have to send you a copy of "Tuesdays with Morrie".
Really makes you grateful for what you have.
- See ya, partner.
-  We're in the money, we're in the money We got a lot of-- what?
How could you let yourself get fired?
Ohh!
Just breathe, Jack.
But where am I to go from here, Will?
What's to become of me?
I don't think I can handle this anymore.
Jack!
I'm the one that just lost my biggest client.
I'm the one that got fired.
Me, remember?
Oh, sure.
It's always about you, isn't it?
What am I supposed to do?
Who's gonna pay for my gym membership?
I've got parachute pants on layaway.
And the food, the food God, I'm giddy from hunger!
And another thing-- when you said a gay guy could do my job in his sleep, what I should have said was, I know one gay guy, I don't know how he sleeps.
Ha!
Finally broke that joke jinx, huh?
Run along, Shecky, I've had a bad day.
Okay?
Aww, Will's had a bad day.
What happened?
Did you crush someone and they got stuck in your Gucci sandals?
Aww!
Grace, I'm really not in the mood for this.
I don't care, you're gonna listen to me.
You know, you may be on top of the world right now, but there is a thing called karma, and one of these days it's gonna come back, and it's gonna bite you on the ass.
And when it does, I'm gonna be standing over you singing the "Told you so" song.
Oh, how's that go again?
Told you so, told you so Told ya, told ya, told ya so.
Mother of God, make her stop.
Look, all I'm saying, Will, is you better pray that Harlin never leaves you-- - Oh my God, Harlin.
- Jack, Jack, Jack!
Look, Harlin is not going to leave me.
Harlin loves me.
Together we're going to make a lot of money.
Now, have I introduced you to my door?
I hope you're right, Will.
'Cause you know that "Told you so" song?
It comes with a special dance.
Here's a little preview.
Okay, Karen, this is working.
By consolidating all your credit cards and turning the remaining one into a travel card, you save on interest and travel expenses.
And that works out to a savings of  Voilà!
Karen?
Oh, that felt good.
Oh, boy.
Ahh.
Where did you go?
Oh, all of your yap-yap-yapping about budgets was bringing me down.
So I popped into lrnez and told 'em to give me $5,000 worth of anything!
Karen, I'm trying to help you.
Look, I know-- I know it's scary, but I promise you, once you get into the swing of things, it's actually kind of fun.
You know what else is kind of fun?
Tuning you out.
Okay, then.
No one can say you didn't give it a good effort.
So, uh - you wanna show me what you got?
- Sure.
Look at this cute little sweater set.
Ohh, isn't this just delicious?
Oh gosh, the color is just yummy.
Oh my God, and the fabric, it's just--  You do the budget, or the kid gets it.
Ha-- oh!
You wouldn't dare!
- Oh, wouldn't l?
- No!
You kill one piece, and the whole ensemble dies.
Maybe I'll just start with the label.
No, honey, that's the best part!
No!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
What do you want?
!
What are you talking about?
!
What are your terms?
You sit down for five minutes and go over this budget with me.
You're just lucky I let my kids take the pepper spray to school for show and tell.
Thattagirl.
Okay, let's talk about clothes.
You spent thousands of dollars in the Madison Avenue boutiques.
Do you know how much you'd save if you just shopped at that outlet mall in Paramus?
Hmm.
Honey, do you know how many things are wrong with that sentence?
- I am serious, I mean it.
- No, no, no, no.
Huh-uh!
If you expect me to shop out of a bin with a bunch of mall-walking blue-hairs in "I Love Grandma" t-shirts, - then you got another thing-- - You know what?
This looks like it's my size.
I think I'm gonna go try it on.
No!
Okay.
Lordy, Lordy, look at all the freaks.
Come on, let's get out of here.
There's nothing here I like.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, no.
You haven't even looked yet.
Come on, you gotta get in there and sort through the rack.
- The what?
- The rack.
You heard the expression "off the rack".
I know the expression, "Stan, hands off the rack".
Bang-bang!
Ohh even in the Midwest I'm funny.
Come on, Karen, dig in.
If you look really hard, you can find some really great-- Okay, this one's got blood on it.
Okay, why don't we just move on to the hemoglobin-free zone?
- Honey, the fabrics scare me.
- Come on.
Karen, you gotta get into the spirit of it.
I'm mean, I've found some really cute outfits here.
I wear them to work, and you tell me how much you hate them.
"Honey, what's going on?
What's happening?
What's all this about"?
Honey, what's this?
What are you doing?
Who's that supposed to be?
Come on, we're not leaving till you try something on.
Ow.
Oh, it's-- oh, honey, honey, can we get a couple of seared ahi salads with honey mustard on the side?
- I don't work here.
- That wasn't my question, was it?
Okay, okay, here we go.
Here we go.
This is perfect for you.
It's your color, it's your size, and it's only $28.
- Hmm?
- Yeah.
That's a great price.
Um, would just excuse me for one second, Grace?
Stan.
Hi, honey, it's me.
Yes, I'm at Designer Markdowns in Paramus, uh-huh.
Oh, the budget thing's fine, yeah.
I'm just about to buy a rhinestone-studded tracksuit.
I thought I'd wear it when we go boating with the Bronfmans.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye bye.
Stan's sending the helicopter.
Budget crisis over.
Okay, Grace, buy yourself a little ugly for work tomorrow.
I'll be on the roof.
- Grace?
- Harlin, hi.
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?
Buying something for the missus.
See, Harlin, that's what I love about you.
No matter how much money you have, you're still humble enough to appreciate a good bargain.
Oh, not this piece of crap.
I'm buying her the whole damn mall.
So, uh how's Will doing?
I think you'd know better than anyone.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
But don't worry, I'm on him.
I'm giving him a really hard time.
Whoa, you're a cold-hearted little thing, aren't you?
Well, you know, if he's gonna let work get to him like that It's just so unattractive.
I mean, even I don't want to be around him.
You know, Grace, I don't presume to understand the very modern relationship you two got going, but in the great state of Texas, you'd be considered a bitch.
Excuse me?
I think a person ought to show more compassion when a friend gets fired.
What?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- Oh, it was good.
It's always good.
- Busy?
- Oh, you know, you can't imagine.
Harlin is working me to the bones.
Meetings with investors, conference calls, contracts.
At one point, it got so crazy, I said "herewith" when I meant "notwithstanding".
I don't know how much longer I can keep up this pace.
Will?
- Will, I know.
- What?
- I ran into Harlin today.
- Oh?
He's still not pulling that practical joke where he pretends like he fired me?
Did he?
He's so funny with that.
- Will-- - Okay.
You were right.
It came back to bite me in the ass.
I'm a jerk, okay?
I got too full of myself, I got too hung up on the money.
So go ahead, give me the whole thing.
The whole "Told you so" song and dance.
Not even a "told ya"?
Starting over.
I'm a little bit scared here.
I'm not.
- Sit down, I got a joke for you.
- Oh, no.
Come on, come on!
Come on.
Come on, sit down.
Ready?
How many gay lawyers does it take to win a case?
- How many?
- 37.
One to win the case, and 36 to go out to brunch and trash him.
Ahh, ahh-- I see a little smile!
I see a little smile!
That counts.
That makes it an official joke!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Will: Wow.
- Grace: What?
It's just so weird, you know?
It's exactly four years ago today that I moved into this office, and here I am closing it down.
It is weird.
It's also wrong.
You moved in the height of summer.
Remember the window was open, and we thought it smelled like wet wool on a dead man?
Ah yes, the new scent by "Decay-NY".
- I gotta go.
- All right.
You seem okay.
I am, I think.
Seems like something's missing.
What is it?
Oh, right, my career.
Hey, okay, maybe this'll help.
No matter how bad you're doing, chances are Jack's doing much worse.
Huge promotion!
Ow!
You crushed my nose.
Sorry!
lf it's broken, we'll get it fixed.
For the second time.
I heard that, you bitch.
And this nose has never been touched.
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can pick up your fries at the next window.
Guess what?
I've been promoted to captain at my catering company.
And tonight I'm supervising an event at the Waldorf-Astoria.
I will have eight men under me.
How great is that?
Eight men?
What'd you do, write the Gay Make-A-Wish Foundation?
Could you just once reach into that cold black heart of yours and say, "Congratulations, handsome"?
Hey, handsome, look around-- I'm closing down my office.
I've lost all my clients.
So you'll forgive me if I'm not jumping up and down for joy because you've now made head butter curler.
FYl, you SOB, cater-waitering is T-U-F F. Oh, tough.
Yes, I know.
All those years at waiter grad school.
The lectures, the all-nighters, all to answer the eternal question that has plagued mankind since the dawn of consciousness-- "Chicken or fish"?
Listen, mister, and I use the term loosely-- you couldn't do my job for even one night.
Jack, a monkey could do your job, providing he had a tux and a lisp.
Then put your money where your mouth is-- I'm short a man tonight.
I dare ya to fill in for him.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Hah!
You're afraid because you know you can't hack it.
Jack, I just said I'd do it.
What just happened?
You challenged me and I accepted your challenge.
Besides, it sounds like it'll be more fun than sitting at home watching Regis say, "Is that your final answer"?
Okay, fine.
Be at the Waldorf at 5:00 sharp, and rent a tux.
- I have a tux.
- No you don't.
I borrowed it.
This is one consumer who is not gonna take responsibility for something that is clearly your fault.
Karen?
Karen!
Yeah, I'm up, I'm up!
Stan, get off of me!
Where am l?
Karen, you are at work, it's 10:30 in the morning, and because you seem to believe that fabric can be sent over phone lines, I now owe this guy $150 for a service call.
Oh my God.
It's 10:30?
Honey, why'd you let me sleep so late?
I gotta get outta here.
There's a needle full of botulism with my forehead's name written all over it.
What are you lookin' at, Rogaine failure?
Nothing, I'm sorry.
Good.
Okay.
Be back at 4:00-- ish.
Wow!
Yeah.
She usually doesn't come back.
- What's it like working with her?
- I wouldn't know.
Well, I love her.
I've seen her movie "Next to Godliness" Iike She's never been in a movie.
When I first saw her, I wasn't sure, but then, you know, the voice--  It's definitely her.
You must have her confused with someone else.
It happens.
People confuse me with Julia Roberts all the time.
Why?
Well, the hair, the smile, and  "I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love me".
Trust me.
That is dead on.
Well, trust me, that's her.
Just rent "Next to Godliness".
You'll find it in the adult section.
"Adult"?
Adult like Merchant-lvory, or adult like, "Gee, thank God you two plumbers arrived".
That one.
The napkin fold du jour will be winter cranes-- and mind the beaks!
Sidebar, how Madonna is this?
- Hey, Jack.
- Don't "hey" me!
You're late!
I'm sorry, but I had to rent a tux and the old guy measuring me had the shakes, so the inseam situation was not pleasant for me.
Just get in line.
Good news, gentlemen, since Mr. Truman has deigned to grace us with his presence, we now have enough waiters to do ballet service.
Ballet service, huh?
What does that make you, the nutcracker?
Truman, front and center.
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!
Damn it, when we're being friends, it's fine to treat me like crap, but I will not have you ruining this event and undermining my authority.
- Clear?
- Okay, okay.
Wait.
Yes, mm-hmm?
Ye-- Ohh!
Do I have to do everything around here?
Look, I'm breaking in a rookie right now.
I don't have time for games.
- Jack!
- I'm talking to the kitchen-- Get me the thing that this plugs into.
-  - Karen: This room is a pigsty and you're a dirtypig boy.
- Man: But, Mommy-- - Karen: Don't "Mommy" me!
Here's what happens to dirtypig boys.
Oh!
Sorry I'm late.
Oh God, that sounded insincere.
I'm late.
Honey, what's going on?
What's happening?
What's with the TV?
Oh, I'm watching what I would call the feel-good movie of my life.
Did you rent "Pretty Woman" again?
Come on.
Give it up, honey.
The only thing you two have in common is horse teeth and bad taste in men.
- Karen: You're a filthy little piggy!
-  Karen, something you want to tell me?
That's not me.
Karen: What's going on, honey?
What's happening?
Why aren't you licking that floor?
.
Oh, all right, it is me!
But it's not what you think!
Really?
'Cause I think it's you in a maid's uniform, whipping some old guy in a onesie.
Am I wrong?
Come on, it's just a little fetish film.
Oh my God, how did this thing get into circulation?
Oh my God.
This is the end of me.
I don't think I can go on.
- Karen, what are you doing?
- No, don't stop me!
Karen, don't be ridiculous!
There we go, nice and cold.
- Oh boy.
- Just one question.
Yeah.
Is dirty little pig boy the other white meat?
- Come on, spill it.
- Well, I was just out of college, I was broke.
It's the oldest story in the world-- boy meets girl, boy wants girl to do dominatrix film.
Girl says, "Naked"?
Boy says, "Yeah".
Girl says, "Forget it".
Boy says, "Okay, then just wear this rubber dress and beat the old guy with a scrub brush.
Girl says, "How hard"?
Yes, that is an old story.
No, no, no, no.
You don't take that tone with me, no.
It's enough that I'm gonna be the laughingstock of Manhattan, but now to have you throwing this in my face and laughing at me like that?
No.
That's it.
I'm outta here.
Oh, Karen, come on.
I was just making a joke.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I have a little joke for you-- Knock knock I'm not there.
Ready?
Spaghetti sauce!
And we're moving, we're moving, and pace, pace, pace.
And serpentine around the room, and elbows in and show those teeth.
Now snake, now snake.
Now snake once more.
Hey, watch the jazz hips!
We aren't doing Starlight Express here.
Okay, now, eyes up.
Working as one, relevate and release.
Very nice.
I'm very proud of all of you.
Not bad for a rookie, huh?
I'm not really looking for new friends.
Well, you're not really getting one.
Oh my God.
It's show time, fellas.
Places!
All right, we got just a couple of minutes before Abba gets here.
Abba?
The band?
That's all we need is more dancing queens!
No, Will, it's spelled differently.
There's only one B. ABA.
The ABA?
!
That's the American Bar Association!
Oh, good, bartenders are such a fun crowd.
No, Jack, the ABA is lawyers!
I'm gonna know all these people.
Would you relax?
No one's gonna recognize you in uniform.
Oh, right.
This tea towel over my arm changes the way my face looks.
- I'm going.
- You're not going anywhere.
I can't do ballet service with an odd number of men.
Then do it with a number of odd men.
Oh my God!
Look, these people are my colleagues.
Do you know how humiliating this is gonna be?
Say hello to the hard part.
Serving food is easy.
Keeping your dignity when peppering Matt Damon's salad is hard.
- Why Matt Damon?
- He has my career.
I see.
Goodbye.
I know this is a rough time for you, okay?
But you've had your success.
This is my turn.
So you decide.
You gonna be a friend or are you going to bail?
Huh?
Oh.
Hors d'oeuvre?
Will Truman?
- Brian Kelly.
- What is with the outfit?
You look like you should be serving us.
And I don't mean papers.
Hah-hah!
Me, a waiter?
Are you kidding?
Excuse me, I asked for one crab cake, not a whole tray.
So, Brian Kelly.
It was funny, just the other day I was thinking Wasn't it?
What was it?
I was reading a mag-- I'm doing some close-up magic later.
Don't tell anybody.
Hello?
Yeah.
What can I do for-- Well, lookoe, lookie loo.
Karen Delaney, right?
How long has it been, Age has done nothing to you.
Well, it's whacked you in the face with a shovel and left you for dead!
You look like hell.
Honey, I need a favor.
Okay, just to confirm everybody's entrées, there are two steak, two salmon and one big fat chicken.
- That'd be me.
- Great.
- Fresh pepper for you?
- That'd be fine, pal.
- Terrific.
- Ow!
- Okay.
- How about an apology?
I'm really sorry.
Not you, Will.
I was talking to Dr. Pepper here.
Ha ha!
I'm so sorry, sir.
Fresh pepper for you?
- No, thank you.
- Okay, very good.
Ow.
Just tell me how many of those tapes there are and how I get 'em back.
Oh yeah, I can get that information just like that.
Just let me e-mail headquarters first, all right?
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
I have no friggin' idea!
We made like 50 and sold them to video stores all over Manhattan.
All over Man-- you lowlife!
Listen, I've built a big life for myself and now it's ruined.
I'm sorry, Karen.
My bad.
How about a little, you know, "kissarooni" for old times' sake, huh?
How can you even ask me that, you double-crossing, conniving-- - Oh - You see?
See, you couldn't hit me, could you?
That's because deep inside of you, the flame of passion is still alive.
Now come on, hot stuff.
How about that kiss, hmm?
You think I would let my bare hand touch that face?
God only knows where it's been.
- I just left you a message.
- No, no.
Don't even start.
I quit.
Why?
'Cause I saw you in one lousy movie?
No, Grace, because the balance of power has shifted between us.
You used to put me on a pedestal and look at me like I was some kind of a superwoman the epitome of everything that's good and decent and true.
Um okay.
But now when you look at me, all you're gonna see is the woman in that video-- a bossy, domineering harpy who uses her body to get what she wants.
You're right.
That is a pretty profound shift.
Yeah.
So I quit.
I'm just gonna clean out my desk and leave.
There.
I'm outta here.
If you need me I'll be in seclusion, suffering in the dark silence of my Park Avenue mansion of shame, shame, shame on me.
Karen wait.
- You-- you might wanna take this.
- What's that?
Oh, it's just all 50 copies of "Next to Godliness".
Oh, my G-- Honey, how did you?
I've been in every sleazy video store in Manhattan.
I went into rooms Bob Guccione wouldn't go into without a hazmat suit.
I had to weave through icky boxes with titles like "Drive This, Miss Daisy" "Diddler on the Roof' "The Ass Menagerie".
- Oh!
- So You never have to worry about anyone seeing this again.
And I will look at you the same way I always have-- as a spoiled, shrill, gold-digging socialite who would sooner chew off her own foot than do an honest day's work.
Oh, honey, I love ya.
Okay, honey, that's enough, God!
When is your video coming out?
Oh, I am starving.
What's with these monkeys?
Who do I have to sleep with to get my steak?
Take your pick.
Hey, pepper boy!
Where's my dinner?
I'm sorry for the delay, sir.
We're a little shorthanded this evening.
One of my waiters bailed on me because he has a weak constitution and is filled with fear and shame.
I don't think I asked for your life story.
I just want a piece of meat.
Don't we all?
I mean, I'm sure you do.
Please be patient.
Be patient?
You coppin' an attitude with me?
- Whoa, Brian, take it easy.
- No, Will, listen to this guy.
This nobody's talking a tone with me.
There's no tone.
He's just doing his job, which is not easy, by the way.
Oh, yeah, it's real hard.
He puts rolls in a basket.
Good idea, sir.
Why don't I get you some more bread?
No, no, no, we're not finished here.
Hang on a second.
- Where the hell is my steak?
- All right, that's it.
- Take your hands off him!
- What's your problem?
For one thing, you're creasing my tux.
Jack, you don't have to put up with this.
- I'm working, so I do.
- Yeah, well, I don't.
At what point did you decide it was okay to treat people like this?
Will, I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to pepper, here.
Brian, I got news for ya.
I'm a pepper!
Excuse me?
I'm a pepper, he's a pepper and considering the grades you got in law school, you're a heartbeat away from being a pepper too.
Why don't you sit down, shut up and wait for your meat?
If the rest of you will excuse me, I have a ballet to perform.
Okay, everyone, round 'em up.
Smile.
Step lively.
Relevate.
Very good.
Very proud.
Jack, if I sounded anything like that guy, I'm sorry.
Will, letting me keep this tux means never having to say you're sorry.
Done.
I just wish there was some way I could get back at him.
You mean like putting a laxative in his soup?
- Oh, that would be so good!
- Already done.
You are awesome.
Don't be so cheery, I put one in yours too.
You will not believe the day I had.
No, no, no.
Whatever it is, I guarantee I can top it.
Okay.
You open.
Cater-waitering for Jack at the Waldorf-Astoria.
Good open.
But I see your Waldorf and raise you-- hunting for porn all over Manhattan.
Running into law school classmates while serving them crab cakes.
Getting groped in an adult video store by a former New York City mayor.
Enjoying an appetizer of potato, leek and laxative soup.
Oh, that's good.
I don't know if I can-- oh, oh, oh, oh, what's this?
Oh yes, yes, yes-- Karen, actually doing work.
No, no, Grace, that's not gonna do it.
Let's just go to videotape, shall we?
-  - Karen: Baby's made a mess.
- Dirtypig baby.
-  Oh, I fold.
I fold.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Okay, here's the Thanksgiving menu so far-- apple pie, pumpkin pie, blueberry tart, and ice-cream roll.
What am I missing?
Cake!
We need cake.
Did you take a bong hit before you wrote that?
Hear ye, hear ye!
The holiday shopping season has just begun.
Here are your lists.
I suggest you surprise me with the things that are in bold.
Oh, you know, speaking of surprises-- we're gonna have a special guest for dinner tomorrow.
Is this where you try to be funny and tell me that Cher is coming?
Well, it's not gonna work this time, okay?
But is she?
Come on, Jack, Cher hasn't eaten since the '70s.
Give you a little hint-- it's someone that you love, but you don't get to see her very often.
Okay, I'm thinking Liza, but go on.
And she gave birth to you.
- Okay - It's your mom, genius.
My mo-- how could y-- you're-- rotten!
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, woman on the verge, what's going on?
I don't have the same relationship with my mother as you do with yours.
You never picked out her brassieres?
We don't need that, thank you.
Jack, she called here looking for you and only mentioned like 30 times that she had no plans.
I thought I was doing a good thing.
The woman is a monster, and you clearly did this to torture me.
I did not!
That was just an unexpected bonus, really.
Where are you going?
I'm going to go uninvite her.
Damn you, Otis, I'm taking the stairs!
Jack!
- What was that?
- I know.
I don't think I've seen him this upset since they hired a female urologist at the free clinic.
Yello!
Hot dish coming through and she's carrying a casserole.
- Who's that?
- Jack's mom.
Whew!
86 minutes.
- Not bad.
- Yeah.
Judith, you do realize that Thanksgiving is tomorrow.
I'm doing a dry run, Will.
I wanted to see how long it would take me to get here while carrying a casserole dish.
The other benefit of a dry run is that I power-walk the whole time while clenching my buttocks, like so.
You can't tell I'm doing anything, but my ass sure can.
Oh.
- Like mother, like son.
-  You must be Grace.
Jack said you were sort of funny.
Yes, I am Grace.
Jack said I was funny?
No, he said you were sort of funny.
You're a cutie.
I can see why Jack wooed you.
I bet you made an adorable couple.
Come on, come on, come on!
Uh-- whoa!
Adorable couple?
l Yeah.
And I think it's terrific that you and Jack have stayed friends even after he dumped you.
Bye-bye.
Dumped me?
What are you talking about?
Jack's a ho-- my God, she has no idea!
Okay, cranberry sauce "Add four cups of cranberries, one cup sugar and orange zest to a heavy stockpot.
Bring to a boil.
Then simmer and reduce for 45 minutes".
-  - Yeah.
That'll happen.
Hi, Will.
Look, I never got ahold of my mom, so when she gets here, I'm just gonna take her to the Russian Tea Room.
Yeah, that way none of us have to deal with the monster.
So, I'm gonna need your Amex, and FYl, how about my own card?
This is getting a little annoying.
The Russian Tea Room?
Wow!
You'd do that just to save us from the monster?
That's the kind of friend I am.
I thought it might be because you haven't told your mother you're gay!
I don't know what you're talking about.
She came here yesterday, Jack.
Damn her and her dry runs!
You told me you took an oath before God and your mother - that you would never deny who you are.
- I lied.
You told me some elaborate story about how you came out to her - as a way of avoiding peewee football.
- I lied.
You forced me to come out to my own mother.
You teased me and you pressured me and you even left a copy of "The Sensuous Gay Man" on her washing machine.
I lied.
I'm a bad man.
Now leave me alone with my shame!
How could you not tell her?
Will, I tried to.
I had so many chances, you know-- when she caught GI Joe and Big Jim shacking up in Big Jim's sports camper; when she caught me in bed with Steven and a Dirt Devil.
But I don't know, she's not the easiest woman to talk to.
She's the most self-involved person I know.
The fruit didn't fall far from that tree.
Here's a thought-- why don't you try telling her directly, you hypocrite?
Stop badgering me with your $10 words!
I'm leaving.
I can't take any more of this.
Hello, lover.
Wrong way.
Closet's in there.
Once you go, Jack, you never go back.
All right, fine.
I'll do it, okay?
Tonight at dinner, I'll tell my mother I'm gay.
God, I would think after 30 years, it would be kind of liberating.
Oh, no, we're not telling her I'm 30.
Hi, honey.
What are you doing here?
You invited me.
Yeah, but I never thought you'd come.
I figured you'd be spending the holiday with Stan and the kids.
What?
No.
Honey, your apartment looks good.
I like what you've done with the place.
Karen, I don't live here anymore and you've been to my new place.
Boy, you try to be nice Hmmm.
Well, you've come on a good night.
Jack's mother is going to be joining us and she doesn't know Jack's gay.
How could she not know?
What is she, headless?
I guess you believe what you choose to believe.
One time, Judith caught him in bed with a guy and Jack convinced her that they were doing a school check for lice.
Oh.
And when she caught him wearing her high heels, he said it was because they helped him with an inner-ear problem.
Oh.
And he also told her that I am his ex-girlfriend.
And she bought that?
!
Oh.
- Wilma.
- Cruella.
Jack is in my wardrobe trying to find the perfect coming out-fit.
Heard that!
I am metaphorically curled up in the fetal position and you continue to kick me about the ear, nose and throat?
- How about a little support?
- Okay.
All right.
Jack, this isn't gonna be as hard as you think.
On some level, your mother has to know you're gay.
- I mean, she has met you, right?
-  We're all here for you, okay?
Right, Karen?
Why wasn't I your girlfriend, queer bait?
What?
!
You told your mother that Grace was your girlfriend!
How could you?
Karen, I didn't even know you when I made up that lie.
Oh, yeah?
When you met me, then you should've broken up with her and hooked up with me!
You're married.
I'm gay.
Not in the lie!
Excuse me.
Eyes on the crisis, okay?
If I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna need calm in the room.
Okay?
Calm.
Sum-fun-yung-gai-hung-so-lo Zum-fun-yung-gai-hung-so-lo.
What is that?
I think it's his Fire lsland mating call.
- There.
I am now calm.
-  - Judith: Hello.
- Sarah Jessica Parker!
Hide me!
It is time for you to grow up.
You're gonna open that door be a man and tell your mom you sleep with guys.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
Ah, look at you.
- Oh, no, look at you.
- Okay, look at me.
No, look at me.
Oh God, that table setting's exquisite, Iike it's fit for a queen.
You gonna take this one, or should l?
Will: Before we eat, my family has this tradition where we go around the table and we each say the thing we're most thankful for.
But this year, I thought we'd add a tradition-- everybody has to tell a secret about themselves, that they've been too cowardly to reveal.
- Jack, why don't you start?
- Mmm--  Grace, what are you most thankful for?
What?
Wait.
I-- I'm not ready.
Wait, give me a second.
I want mine to rhyme.
- Karen?
- Okay.
I'm thankful that I found a pharmacologist who's as dumb as a box of hair.
And, my secret is-- Jack and I were doing the dirty-dirty while you two were still together!
What?
Sorry, honey.
I guess you just weren't woman enough for him.
Oh, yeah.
- Jack, back to you.
- Mmm, uh-- All right.
What am I thankful for?
So many things, really the smell ofjasmine--  - a kitten's purr - Oh.
"In Style" magazine, - Telemundo-- - Jack.
I know.
I know.
My secret is-- there are things you want to say sometimes, but you just never do.
You want to say them, but damn it, you just can't.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I know what this is all about.
- You do?
- Uh-huh.
He just can't stand you two fighting over him!
You are one sharp tack, Judith.
Remember that time at Matt Stokes' party, where we met for the first time?
And I was in such deep denial about being gay, - I think I was 20 lbs.
overweight?
- 30.
- Maybe 25.
- Maybe 35.
Anyway, you came up to me.
We didn't know each other that well.
You pulled me aside and you said, "Aren't you tired yet"?
And I was tired.
Tired of actually reading "Playboy" for the articles, tired of keeping my Bette Midler albums in Led Zeppelin sleeves.
So you took me to clubs and introduced me to people, made me realize what I'd been missing by not being myself and I'm thankful for that.
I also taught you how to dance without pointing all the time.
And I'm thankful for that.
Here's my secret-- I admire you, Jack because you are more yourself than anyone else I have ever known.
Will, look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but-- this is different.
My mother will fall apart.
She's-- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
Aren't you tired yet?
It's gonna be fine.
Somebody needs to get back to the gym.
Karen, how come you moved in on her man?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
He came on to me, okay?
Yeah.
He was looking for a real woman, not somebody who just lays there like bibb lettuce.
Ah-ah-oh.
Bibb lettuce.
Judith, that is a lie.
This whole thing is a lie.
The truth is, is that The truth is after two weeks with her, he came running back to me.
- He did not!
- Oh, but he did!
What were his exact words again?
Oh, yes-- "My Harold-and-Maude phase is over".
Oh, I have half a mind to throw this martini right in your face!
- Mom?
- Jack!
Honey, I'm worried, you haven't said a thing about my bangs.
They're a little short, but they'll grow in.
Mom, uh, I have something I want to say to you.
I've kept this from you for a long time and that's wrong, because it makes it seem like I'm ashamed of something I'm not ashamed of.
I want you to know who I am because I'm proud of who I am.
Mom are you wearing Chloé?
Jack!
Mom, I'm gay.
Oh.
Judith, it's okay.
So he's gay.
He's still the same little boy who gave you highlights for the first time.
Honey, I think you're missing the silver lining here.
When you're old and in diapers, a gay son will know how to keep you away from chiffon and backlighting.
Mom, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is who I am.
You could never disappoint me.
I just want you to be happy.
Looking back on it, there have been clues.
When you were a child, you were overly fond of the nursery rhyme "Rub-A-Dub-Dub, Three Men in a Tub".
And you do have a lot of flamboyantly gay friends.
I mean, look at Will.
No matter what, Jack, you're what I'm most thankful for in the whole world.
Then why are you crying?
Because I have a secret too.
The man you think is your father is not your father.
What?
My God.
This is like watching Gays of Our Lives.
Who's my father?
Well, it's not exactly clear.
Mother, if your explanation doesn't end with the phrase "born in a manger," I'm gonna be violently ill.
It was the '60s!
I went to this party.
Keys were thrown in a bowl, the bowl was thrown in the pool, off came the ponchos, and 9 months later there you were.
Oh, okay.
Uh I can accept that.
So the guy I thought was my dad wasn't.
So Jack's gay, huh?
Hm.
No wonder he went back to you.
How you doing there, little buddy?
Oh, all right, for the most part.
A little weirded out about who my real father is.
I just hope when I find him, he doesn't wear a black helmet and speak with the voice of James Earl Jones.
"Luke, you're a homo".
Thanks for everything, Grace.
Jack, you know I'll always treasure what we had together.
All I ask is that when you speak of me later-- and I know that you won't-- please be kind.
Get over it, Grace.
You already have one gay husband, leave me be.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Will you're not going to believe what just happened.
- Are you watching this?
- I've never seen "The Usual Suspects".
They're just about to reveal who Keyser Soze is.
It's Kevin Spacey.
Okay.
Listen, coming off the stunning success of I have been asked to play the lead in an employee training video for the Canterville Plate Glass Company.
Well, good for you, Jack.
What's the video about?
It's a hard-hitting look at sexual harassment in the workplace.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Sexual harassment?
Starring the guy that asked his coworker at Starbucks if he had two nipples for a dime?
Which by the way, was the beginning of a fulfilling three-day relationship.
- Couldn't you once be happy for me?
- Don't you think it's possible that maybe I'm jealous because you've got this great new job and I've been unemployed for a month?
- Oh no, are you?
- Yeah, right.
Hateful.
I'm raiding your closet.
They said dress like a repressed straight guy.
Hey, I need you to help me sue someone.
Did the lady at the Korean market call you mister again?
You buy one tube of cream bleach and you're mister for the rest of your life.
No, but that has nothing to do with this.
Okay, I have this client, right?
I have a signed contract.
I spend a huge chunk of money and then-- - He backed out.
- Wow.
See?
See?
This is what I need.
Someone who'll show Ben Doucette he can't order a moustache chair - and then back out.
- What?
It's sort of like a club chair, but the top is curvy-- No, not the chair.
Ben Doucette of Doucette & Stein?
Yeah, he's some big deal lawyer guy.
- You-- you know him?
- I know of him.
He's a killer.
Sweetie, you need a real litigator, not a corporate attorney.
Especially one who's spent the last month arguing the case of ass versus sofa cushion.
What is this?
Do I hear doubt, Mrs. Doubtfire?
I just-- I don't know if I can do this.
I mean, this is Ben Doucette and I'm-- I'm a little rusty.
Come on, Little Rusty.
You can do this.
As Jane Seymour says to her wheelchair-bound husband in every Lifetime movie "I believe in you".
Oh my God, I watched two of those today.
I'll do it.
Hi, Grace.
Bye, Grace.
Can't talk.
In a movie.
Just enough time to grab some ice cream and run to acting class.
Why don't you just combine them and study with "Uta Hagen" Dazs.
- You don't get that, do you?
- Not really, no.
All right, he's kept us waiting half an hour.
I say we go find him in his office.
Listen to you, Mr. "Thing with the boom boom".
I love it when you get like that.
I've just been thinking, why am I scared of this guy?
He's a lawyer.
How intimidating can he be?
You be in my office in one hour, and be nervous.
Hello, I'm Benjamin Doucette.
- Will Truman.
- I know who you are, - your reputation precedes you.
- Your reputation precedes you.
And Mr. Truman, my reputation precedes your reputation.
Can you believe I said that without a cigar?
Let's do this.
A cup of proper coffee in a copper coffee cup.
Unique New York.
Unique New York.
Unique New-- Hello, Mr. Dent.
- Looking forward to working with you.
- Uh-huh.
Oh, I've brought you another resume.
I've updated my special skills.
Um I now know stage combat, banjo, and as of last night I can drive a commuter ferry.
- Kind of.
- Bad news.
We're canceling the shoot.
Oh no, no, no.
I didn't get a message.
I didn't leave a message.
The girl dropped out.
She got an airborne virus.
It's attacking her joints.
Mr. Dent, we can't-- we can't cancel.
Look, this is my big break, okay?
I've already taken ads out in "Variety" congratulating myself.
I'm sorry.
Unless a girl walks through that door this minute, we're done.
Honey when I agreed to drive you to the set, you didn't say it was on Staten lsland.
How the hell am I ever going to get the stench of landfill and working class families out of tropical lightweight wool?
What are you looking at, eye bags?
I'm gonna make a wild guess here and say you two are more than friends but less than lovers.
- You're gay and she's straight.
- Very good.
Now if you guess my weight you get a t-shirt that says, "That's really none of your business".
Now what we're looking for is full reimbursement for expenses.
So you were two years out of law school when you started your own practice.
That's pretty risky considering you were on the partnership track at Getman & D'Onofrio.
We also seek token amount for compensatory damages.
And then you go and steal Harlin Polk right out from under them.
Now that I love.
That's-- that's theater, man.
It's very impressive.
We're also looking for interest on the money she laid out.
But it must be rough.
One minute you're a rising star, and then the next you're sitting at home watching-- I'm guessing Lifetime.
And right in the middle of a "Designing Women" marathon, the thought starts to creep in.
"Maybe I've lost it.
Maybe I never even had it to begin with".
What is with you and the nuts?
!
Are you gonna eat one or what?
Don't like eating 'em.
Just like crushing 'em.
Oh, give me a break.
Shouldn't you be stroking a white cat while you say that?
- Excuse me?
- This is it?
This is the famous Ben Doucette intimidation tactic?
You crush nuts?
That's why I should never meet a legend.
It's always disappointing.
Like the time I met Big Bird at the lce Capades.
Not so big.
So unless you're prepared to make me an offer, I'm out of here.
Here's your offer.
Let me know what you think.
It's good to see you again.
Ha!
- Ha?
- Oh, he knows what I meant.
- What happened?
What happened?
- Well - He made us an offer.
- Oh!
Yes!
What's it say?
What is it?
He offered - me a job.
- Yes!
What?
No!
- Wow.
- What kind of offer is that?
What was he thinking?
Why would he do that?
Oh my God.
Don't you see?
The only reason you were offered a job is so that he can slither out of the lawsuit.
Of course, that ruthless bastard offered me a five-year contract, paid vacation, a huge signing bonus, all to make a dispute over slipcovers go away.
How could I have been so blind?
Why do your people always go to sarcasm first?
Okay, so it was a real offer.
You're not actually thinking of taking it, are you?
Well, let me think about this.
I got a job, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I got a-- Come on.
- How could you not be happy for me?
- How can I be happy for you?
You were on my side and now you're bailing on me.
I-- I think that sucks.
Would you consider this?
That once I'm on the inside, I'll be able to settle this and maybe even get you a lot more money.
- You a job, job, job.
- I got a job, job, job.
So it goes line, line, line, do the inappropriate gesture, then freeze and the announcer moves in.
Okay?
You guys ready?
Jack?
Jack?
I'm sorry, I'm at one with my character right now.
So from here on in, could you please refer to me as Mr. Weckerly?
Uh no.
Good idea, I'll use that.
I'll use that.
Okay, places.
Rolling.
And action.
Good morning, Mr. Weckerly.
I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting.
Thank you.
Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder.
Allow me.
Oh!
Cut!
Okay, lady, you need to freeze.
I was freezing.
Oh, you meant-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
You're gonna ruin this for me.
- What are you doing?
- Honey, what are you doing?
That tongue of yours could have a career.
- It's driving me crazy.
- Places.
Let's make some magic, people.
And action.
Good morning, Mr. Weckerly.
I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting.
Thank you.
Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder.
Allow me.
Okay, stop.
What you've just witnessed is an example of inappropriate office behavior.
Clearly, this female employee is uncomfortable, and finds her boss's overture unwelcome.
Meats and cheeses, you are rockin' my clock, Mary.
Cut!
Cut!
What is going on, people?
You're supposed to freeze.
I was freezing, I'm working with an amateur.
- You freeze or you're out of here.
- Okay, God bless you.
Let's go again, people.
You blow this for me, and so help me God, you'll wake up with Rosario's head in your bed.
Then just don't put it all the way in.
I'll have to adjust my whole character, but whatever.
Dent: Okay, people in theirplaces.
Settle, and action.
Morning, Weckerly.
I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting.
Thank you.
Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder.
Allow me.
Okay, stop.
What you've just witnessed is an example of inappropriate office behavior.
Clearly this female employee is uncomfortable and finds her boss's overture unwelcome.
- Sensitivity could effect your-- - Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
You're gonna cut now?
Oh, typical man.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
We are gonna do this until we get it right, okay?
Have you met my assistant Mrs. Freeman?
- No.
Mrs. Freeman, nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
- What's with the tux?
- Well, I'm going to a dinner.
They're honoring African-Americans who run big-time law firms in New York City.
It's being held in a phone booth on the Upper East Side.
Is that the same phone booth where they held the Gays for Buchanan rally?
Yes.
So what'd you want to see me about?
Oh, it's this whole thing with Grace.
Oh yes, I am so glad you brought that up.
Make it go away, would you?
- Okay, you just want me to pay her off?
.
- No, no, no.
I don't want you to pay, no.
I want you to take her to arbitration and kick her ass.
Hmm.
Wrong cufflinks.
Murphy's got a good pair.
Let's get his.
How important is this, really?
The amount is only slightly less than you paid for those cufflinks that you just threw into my garbage pail.
It's not about the money, Will.
I don't lose.
And since you're working for me now, you don't lose.
But you're putting me in a kind of awkward situation here.
- Grace is my friend.
- Yeah?
Don't you think that's a conflict of interest?
Will, do you know how many people I've pissed off by giving you this office?
- Have a good night.
- But-- I really don't have a choice in this, do l?
Huh-uh.
- Knock knock.
- Hey.
Oh my God.
Look at this place.
Will, I think the only thing that is missing is the orchid I stole from the lobby.
Ohh.
Ohh.
- What's with the face?
- Sweetie-- sit down, we need to talk.
- Traitor!
- Grace, just take my check.
I don't want your money.
I want his money.
Yeah, but he's paying me now, so in a way, this is his money.
- I will see you in court.
- It's not court, it's arbitration.
We'll be in a conference room with an arbitrator there.
Then I will see you in a conference room with the arbitrator there.
That did not sound as good.
What a day, huh?
Only 148 takes.
My tongue's drier than a Triscuit in an old lady's cupboard, but I think we got it.
Mmmm, hah!
- You coming to the cast party?
- You see that bag of Doritos?
- Yeah.
- That is the cast party.
Well, thank you very much.
You've just ruined my chance to ever work with Bob Dent again.
Honey, I feel great.
Karen, I hate to give notes to fellow actors, but you were really unprofessional today.
Couldn't you have contained yourself?
.
Couldn't you have shown some kind of respect for acting?
Couldn't you just-- Chaka Khan, you totally found my G-spot.
Oh!
Okay, honey, now do me, do me, do me.
Okay, that's good.
Oh, I like that.
- Okay.
- Okay, me again, me again.
Keep your boobies away, I'm trying to imagine Matt Damon.
Hi, you must be Mr. Buhne, arbitrator.
Grace Adler, victim.
I know you have to remain entirely neutral, but I also know you have to eat.
Which is why I have put together a roasted chicken, artichoke salad and some kreplach direct from Flatbush.
Ms. Adler, I can have no part in that.
Now, would you please sit down so we may begin?
I understand.
I will just leave it right over here in case you want a nice little nosh.
- Grace, where is your lawyer?
- I don't need a lawyer because I have right on my side.
- But you need someone-- - Excuse me, Your Honor, can you instruct opposing counsel to stop badgering the witness?
Grace, you're not a witness, he is not a judge, this is not a trial and you are not a lawyer.
I know you are but what am l?
Okay, so we're in that headspace.
Keep going, keep going.
I'm just hiding.
My ex-wife's in the building.
Every time she sees me, it costs me $10,000.
Will?
- Shouldn't you be over here?
- Oh.
Right.
All right then, let's begin.
I'll give each of you an opportunity to argue your side.
Based on the legal merit of those arguments, I will render a decision.
Mr. Truman, would you care to begin?
According to paragraph three of the contract, any of Ms. Adler's purchases had to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
Ms. Adler made said purchases without the consent of my client therefore he should not be required to pay.
Ms. Adler?
My choices were gorgeous.
Defense rests.
Yeah, but they were not mutually agreed upon.
Look, my choices were flawless.
And if your client can't see that, he is guilty of extremely bad taste.
And isn't that the real crime here today?
- Gracie, there is no-- - Objection!
The familiar cutening of my name implies we like each other.
Ms. Adler, though it's clear you know a lot of legal terms, you've yet to use a single one of them properly.
- May I approach the bench?
- You'd have to build one first.
All right, Mr. Truman, I'm going to rule in your favor.
- What?
- Thank you.
- Now if you could just-- - What?
No!
How could this happen?
I mean, this is so unfair.
Why should I be out thousands of dollars just because you changed your mind?
Okay, maybe I don't know the legal words, but I know the difference between right and wrong and what is wrong is that I worked hard for you.
I did good work, and I'm honest, and that obviously doesn't mean anything.
Okay, Will, let's wrap this up.
Uh  You know what?
I can't do this.
Why not?
Because I'm on the wrong side of this table.
Mr. Truman, outside.
I'm sorry, Ben.
It's this thing I have-- a conscience.
I tried to get rid of it in law school, but it didn't take.
I don't think I'm the kind of lawyer you want for this firm.
You're wrong.
You're exactly what I want.
Mrs. Freeman, make sure Grace gets her check.
Mm-hmm.
What just happened?
Underneath it all you're just a big old softie?
Underneath it all I'd sell my grandmother down the river if it got me a continuance.
But I have me.
That's why I need you.
Wait, wait, wait.
So what, this was just a test?
Like this is Willy Wonka and you've just given me the keys to the chocolate factory?
Will, you've got your job.
But please, don't refer to me as the chocolate factory.
- See you tomorrow.
- But You know I didn't mean anything by the chocolate factory remark, right?
Mm-hmm.
- What happened?
- You're getting your check.
- And I still have my job.
- You're kidding!
I know.
Thank you.
I promise you, I will never again  take sides against the family.
Come on, your attorney's buying you lunch.
Gracie, am I wrong, or is there some large round object in your pants that is not your ass?
Yeah, I didn't think I was going to win, so I stole his bowl.
That's the bowl Ben keeps his nuts in.
- Okay, puttin' the bowl back.
- Oh
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I want this.
this and that.
I want that too.
And I want one of these and this with-- - Do you want this?
- I already got some of that.
You know what they say about dim sum.
"I'll have dim sum and dim some more".
Why can't life be like this?
Why can't they bring around a cart with guys on little plates?
You know?
That way you could sample a little before you committed to a whole one.
"No.
this one's too spicy.
this one's too mealy".
"I'm gonna hate myself in the morning for eating that one".
- Okay.
what do you guys want?
- I'd like a menu.
Yeah.
we don't actually eat this stuff.
You know what?
Just some white rice and.
uh two forks.
Clean.
Why do we have to sit with all the weirdos?
- Ellen.
it's fun.
It's family-style.
- Yeah.
it's family-style.
Later the waiters come over and tell you what a disappointment you are to them.
You know where you can always get your own table?
- The Olive Garden.
Yeah.
- Oh yeah.
In fact.
there's one the next exit down from us in Secaucus.
Ellen: I know what everyone says about The Olive Garden.
but the one in Secaucus is something special.
- Tell 'em about the buffalo wings.
- Try and stop me.
You know how I like food that's spicy but not too spicy?
They've got these buffalo wings - Will: They are so boring.
- Grace: I know.
Grace: Ooh.
Cute guy over there checkin' you out.
- Will: Where?
- Grace: Don't look.
primavera.
marinara.
alfredo.
What is this?
Oh.
that's your rice.
It's in a leaf.
- Can we go somewhere else?
- Uhh sure.
I guess.
We'll go with you.
Uh-- jeez.
just a couple of quick bites?
Ellen: Okay.
Whoa.
Lovin' the food.
Goodness.
We're just-- we're party poopers and we will stay.
I have a suggestion you guys go someplace else and you chaps stay here.
Then some other night.
you can all meet up at your Onion Garden.
Okay.
Well.
thank you very much.
Mr. Man.
but I think I think we can figure this one out on our own.
okay?
All right.
why don't you two stay and we will meet up some other night at The Olive Garden?
- Maybe tomorrow night?
- Great.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Will: Bye.
So.
you guys married?
- No.
I'm gay.
This is my friend.
- Pay up.
honey.
And afterward.
Naomi and Kai took us to this underground club that was so cool it didn't even have a name.
Just a design.
- Like a squiggle and a "pffft".
- Yeah.
The club formerly known as "Pffft" Squiggle.
And afterwards who did I run into in the bathroom?
Peter Gabriel.
Talk about shocking the monkey.
And Kai.
Kai has been arrested with Greenpeace three times.
- I want to get arrested.
- Both: Go outside in that outfit.
Both: Oh.
jinx!
Oh-- did you see this?
- Grace Adler Designs.
- It's me.
- Hey, Ellen.
- Hi.
Hey.
I just called to confirm tonight.
I should probably give you directions.
Right.
tonight.
Right.
- Uh.
will you hold on a second?
- Sure.
It's Rob and Ellen calling about dinner tonight.
Oh.
no.
no.
no.
no.
Naomi and Kai have backstage passes - to Elvis Costello.
- What are we going to do?
We can't lie.
Will's sick.
We have to cancel.
No.
I hope he didn't catch anything from those freaks we left you with last night.
Oh.
Rob said the funniest thing about them.
What was it you said.
honey?
What was it?
Is the circus in town?
I laughed.
I laughed.
Anyway.
tell Will that we hope he feels better.
- and we'll just try another time.
- Okay.
Bye.
We just lied to our friends.
- How does that make you feel?
- I'm not going to lie to you.
- I'll feel great.
- Me too.
- Come on.
buy me a latte.
you big liar.
- Okay.
Okay.
Karen.
I'll be back in an hour.
Um.
answer the-- Who am I kidding?
Thank God.
Why is she always hanging around here?
She does whatever Will does.
He would be the alpha cow.
So.
honey.
how would you like to have a little spa day with me on Monday?
Jack happy.
Jack happy.
That's right.
we'll do a little mud.
a little seaweed.
totally detox.
Then we'll get plastered and go over to my stepkids' school for a little parent-teacher conference.
School?
Why don't you take-- and I'm just going to throw this out at you-- their father?
Honey.
Stan can't make it.
He's having some work done on his Mercedes.
Or his kidneys.
I wasn't really paying attention.
Sorry.
Kare.
no can do.
Elementary schools freak me out.
Too many bad memories.
The name calling.
the taunting.
the vicious games of "Red Rover.
Red Rover.
Iet's beat the hell out of Jack".
Oh.
was poodle not very poo-pular?
You have no idea.
For little Jack McFarland.
or Jack "McFairyland" as I was known.
elementary school was a house of pain.
Oh.
honey.
I am so sorry.
That must have been rough.
And why you?
A sweet little boy with sparkly blue eyes and a beautiful smile.
Oh.
Jack.
Little Jack "McFairyland".
- Karen-- - McFairy-fu-fu-land.
Nah-nah.
I'm a girl - Karen.
this is not the time-- - Hey.
"McFairyland" gimme your lunch money or I'm gonna kick your ass.
Ha ha!
Ha!
Oh God.
Kids can be so cruel.
Karen.
it wasn't funny.
It was a very painful time for me.
Listen.
face your fears.
You're not a kid anymore.
you're a big strong man so get over it.
Karen.
there is no way I'm going over to that-- You just called me a big strong man.
Yes.
I did.
you big strong man.
Okay.
I'll go.
I'm gonna go.
big strong man.
- There's a bunny.
- Stop it!
There's my little tickle bunny.
Naomi: We should get going.
Remember.
when we get backstage.
if anyone asks.
you're press.
- Do you guys have a problem lying?
- No.
I'll just tell them I'm from "Rolling Stone".
Will: No.
no.
I want to be from "Rolling Stone".
Tell them you're from-- "Naugahyde Weekly".
See.
Iying is only a problem if you get caught.
And since we never get caught.
there's never a problem.
Problem.
Hi.
guys.
Hey.
what's going on?
Uh.
we brought some soup for Will.
Oh.
oh oh.
this.
This is just a whole naughty nurse thing I do for Will.
- Makes him feel better when he's sick.
- Oh.
Oh.
but that's so.
so nice with the soup.
and the so sweet.
you guys are the best.
Bye.
Grace.
Grace-- can we come in and see Will?
Oh.
I would love that.
but Will is out like a light.
Will: Grace, what's going on out there?
Whoop.
Iook who's up.
Just-- - Hold on just one minute.
- Well.
should we come in?
No.
that's not a good idea.
It's like germ-a-palooza in there.
- I'll get him.
- Okay.
- Are we ready?
- Uh.
not quite yet.
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?
Um.
I have to settle a bet with the guy out in the hall.
What's the bet?
You wouldn't go in the hall wearing a blanket.
Are you crazy?
We're going to be late for Elvis Cost-- - --hello.
- Rob: Hey.
Grace said you were sick so we brought you some soup.
You guys are so thoughtful.
Bye.
Oh.
oh.
oh-- just one second - Can I use your bathroom before we go?
- Why?
Ellen had two Snapples.
Ohh I-- I wouldn't do that.
It's-- it's germ-a-palooza in there.
Oh my God.
that's what I said!
You could use my apartment.
okay?
Ellen and Rob.
Rob.
why don't you go with her?
- Why would I do that?
- Because you love her!
Come on.
buddy.
be a man.
I do it for Grace.
Yeah.
sorry.
honey I wasn't thinking.
- What are we gonna do?
- It's no biggie.
She'll pee.
they'll leave and we'll go to see Elvis Costello.
Pump it up When you don't really need it Pump it up until you can't feel it Will!
What are you doing?
Oh my God.
it's gotten worse!
- He's got a fever.
- Fever.
it's a fever!
Why were you dancing?
It's a boogie fever.
So uh.
you you guys finished?
No.
Grace.
you're out of toilet paper.
I'm gonna use Will's bathroom.
really.
I won't get sick.
No.
no.
the toilet paper is another one of the boxes.
I know exactly where it is.
Grace: Rob, are you coming?
- Come on.
man.
get with it.
- Rob: Sorry.
honey.
Will.
mate.
Iisten.

- Damn we're good.
Although  Grace?
You want to explain this?
Yes.
I do Will?
Huh?
I'm not going to lie to you.
These are my doctors.
She's an acupuncturist and he's British.
No they're not.
They're the weirdos from the restaurant.
This is a rather awkward moment.
Exit "the weirdos" to get a cab.
We'll be downstairs.
Hurry up.
guys.
- You guys suck.
- How could you lie to us like that?
- It's a fine line-- Iying is - We didn't lie.
It was just a - We're sorry.
- Sorry.
How could you do it.
Grace?
And why don't you try the truth this time?
Okay.
the truth is that sometimes you guys just don't want to do-- We just wanted to try something a little different.
You know-- a little more exciting?
Oh.
okay.
So Will and Grace think we're boring.
Come on.
Rob.
Iet's go.
Um.
actually honey.
I need to go to the-- Let's go.
Rob.
- We'll take the stairs.
- I really need-- Let's go.
Rob!
While we still have some dignity.
Will you stop fidgeting?
What is the matter with you?
I thought I could handle being here but it-- it's too much.
Oh.
I'm having post-traumatic stress disorder.
This is my 'Nam.
man.
Mrs. Walker?
Principal Daley is ready to see you now.
All right.
this shouldn't take long.
He'll tell me the fat one set something on fire.
I'll buy him a new science wing.
and bippity-boppity-boo.
- everybody's happy.
- Karen.
don't leave me alone here.
See you soon, "McFairyland.
" I-- I can't do this.
Give me my backpack.
- I don't have it.
- Come on.
give it.
- Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah.
- Come on.
please.
No.
This one's better for you.
- You can put your makeup in it.
- Jack: Hey, hey!
Give him his backpack.
The purse is mine.
This macho bully schoolyard crap is so 1983 I could vomit.
Now scram!
What's with that hair?
You know you didn't have to do that.
I can take care of myself.
Oh.
I'm sure.
I just don't like anybody playing with my purse.
- Hi.
I'm Jack.
- I'm John.
Nice to meet you.
John.
So.
um what was that all about?
Todd and Curtis don't like me.
Yeah.
well.
Iet me tell you a little something about Todd and Curtis.
okay?
When they grow up.
they're gonna be bloated has-beens with bad shoes and bad marriages.
Does that help you?
I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure they're still gonna take my backpack.
Okay.
in that case.
pull hair.
kick them anyplace that's soft and run like hell.
I just wish I was better at dodge ball.
Then this never would have happened.
Dodge ball?
Who cares about dodge ball?
You ever see that on a resumé?
"Special skills-- dodge ball"?
It's about as useful as American History.
Besides.
there's gotta be other things you're good at.
right?
Well.
I just wrote a play for drama class.
You're a playwright?
I'm a playwright.
- I wrote a one-man show.
- Shut up.
I wrote a one-man show.
- What's it about?
- I guess it's about me.
It doesn't have a title yet.
Well.
I was thinking maybe.
"John's Life".
Or "John's Play".
Or maybe "Only John".
Ever thought about "Just John"?
- "Just John"?
- No.
it's more no jazz hands.
it's "Just John".
"Just John".
It's more from here and there's a pop.
It's "Just John".
- "Just John".
- Yes.
Fabulous.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Holy hangover.
Batgirl.
How fun was last night?
So fun.
- Naomi and Kai know all the best clubs.
- Yeah.
Who'd have thought that after 2:00 a.m..
Tiki Donuts becomes a Latino drag-queen bar.
I forget is Chocolate Eclairette the name of a donut or one of the performers?
Why are you screaming at me?
Oh my God.
When did I get my nipple pierced?
That's your earring.
Oh.
right.
So what time are we hooking up with them tonight?
Midnight.
It's gonna be wild.
- This whole week has been wild.
- I know.
They're crazy.
- They're fantastic.
- I hate them.
Me too.
I've been holding on to these fears since I was like eight years old.
you know?
And it's just like Dr. Schlemenson says.
"Jackie".
--he calls me Jackie.
which I hate but I'm not getting into that with you.
Hello.
you're like 10.
"Jackie.
you must meet your demons.
head on".
And today.
I did it.
I did it.
Man.
I feel good.
How are you?
Okay.
but I think I'm going to be late for my flute lesson.
so l-- You called me down to this godforsaken place to tell me my kids made the honor roll?
Honey.
my time is precious.
Call me when one of them gives birth at the prom.
What are you lookin' at?
- Your shoes.
- Hm.
They're good.
right?
Listen Jack.
all this maternal crap is making me thirsty.
Let's go to The Palm for a couple of "martoonis".
You comin'?
Um.
no.
I'm gonna be late for my lesson.
Suit yourself.
But you'll learn a lot more over martinis at The Palm.
Hey.
Jack.
thanks for your help.
Same here.
Is it just me.
or does The Olive Garden just keep getting better and better?
Mmm.
Good.
So good I'm gonna pay the whole check tonight.
- We're not splitting it?
- No.
ma'am.
That makes me so horny.
Wow.
if I wasn't gay before You sure you want to go through with this?
They're friends.
Will.
come on.
You're our oldest.
dearest friends  and you deserve better.
You do.
I don't know what we were thinking 'cause we love you guys.
- Okay.
we forgive you.
- Water under the bridge.
guys.
- Not quite under the bridge.
Rob.
- Not so much under.
Okay.
there are a few things we need to get straight.
First of all.
no more lies.
Okay?
I would think that after 15 years of friend Will: This is gonna last awhile, isn't it?
- Grace: Oh yeah, but we deserve it.
- Will: Mm.
- Grace: Ooh, cute guy over there.
- Will: Where?
Grace: Psych.
We're at The Olive Garden, Will.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
You're making pancakes.
Yes.
I am.
Heidi.
but please don't tell Grandpapa.
We had a pact.
Four workouts a week.
no carbs.
no sugar.
no fat.
I've totally been cheating.
So have l. Hook me up.
Oh my God!
The day I've been waiting for has finally arrived.
Congratulations.
Jack.
I wish you a long.
happy life as a woman.
Ha ha.
that's so funny.
I forgot you're fat.
I just thought some of us might be interested to know that "Antiques on the Road" is in town.
"Antiques on the Road"?
You're kidding.
No.
I just heard from a friend of mine who sleeps with someone at PBS.
Oh!
They're gonna bring the whole crew.
including.
guess who?
- No.
- Yes.
- Get out!
- Make me.
Who?
What?
Both: Porcelain Paul!
Oh my God.
he's British and cute.
Oh my God.
he's gay and he's going to be my lover.
Somebody want to tell me what "Antiques on the Road" is?
Okay.
It's only the best show on television.
You know.
next to the Creek.
- I'm over the Creek.
- Me too.
So people bring in this stuff and they're appraised by experts.
Sometimes it's worth a lot.
but that's boring.
My favorite part is when someone brings in something that they think is worth millions.
and Porcelain Paul tells them that it's worth like $4.
And the camera stays on them and their face goes Do the face again.
Okay.
Now do the face of someone who had something really valuable.
and ruined it with Lemon Pledge.
All right.
okay.
okay.
Okay.
That sounds fun.
What time is it on?
Uh.
not really looking for any Johnny-come-latelies.
Oh.
please.
please.
please.
can't I be a flouncing geek too?
Oh my God.
I have to get on the show.
because I have to do the face.
Oh my God.
I have to meet Porcelain Paul!
I just know if I can break through that icy British facade.
he'll be mine.
They lived happily ever after.
And that.
children.
concludes our fairy tale.
Good morning.
Mrs. Freeman.
How are you?
You look lovely today.
- You don't really like me.
do you?
- Mm-mm.
Mr. Doucette needs to speak with you.
- I need to speak with you.
Will.
- Let me get you a chair.
As you know.
Will.
different firms have different ways of making their new employees feel welcome.
Some give you a muffin basket.
some give you a briefcase.
At Doucette & Stein.
we give you one week to make me not regret hiring you.
And to do that.
you need to bring in a major client.
one whose name is on one of those buildings out there.
And if you succeed.
that's how junior associates become senior associates.
- And if I don't?
- That's how junior associates become Carl's Jr. associates.
- You have till Friday.
Will.
- Friday.
Like in Friday?
No.
Friday like in Thursday.
but I'll give you till Friday.
This-- this is a little-- I mean.
Iast week.
I was the guy you had to have.
I was the guy with heart.
That was the honeymoon.
Will.
Honeymoon's over.
Good times.
though.
huh?
This strikes me as a tad unfair.
Let me tell you a little story.
Will.
Years ago when I was a young associate.
not unlike yourself.
I went to a bar one night and there were these two beautiful women.
I couldn't decide which one to ask out.
so I took a chance and asked them both.
Turned out to be one of the best nights of my life.
And that relates how?
It doesn't.
I just love telling that story.
One week.
Will.
Don't waste any more of your time listening to pointless stories.
Just wait at table 12.
Paul will be there in 10 minutes.
Congratulations and welcome to the show.
Thank you.
very fine.
Thank you very much.
You did it!
I can't believe that teapot got us on.
What did I tell you?
It's perfect.
To the untrained.
uneducated eye.
this may look like an early Why.
yes.
it does.
But to those of us in the know.
it's a cheap knockoff I bought at that lesbian thrift shop in the East Village.
By the way.
what do the girls have against hair-care products?
It's their way I've got it.
When we go on.
I'm gonna come up with some sob story about how much we need the money.
That'll make the face really pop.
- Oh.
that's good.
-  That'll help me break through to Paul.
This is genius.
You'll get to do the face and I'll get to do Paul.
Win.
win.
win.
Sneaky.
sneaky.
sneaky.
- Oh.
oh.
oh.
I am so sorry.
- That's okay.
That's okay.
Oh.
what is that?
ls that a music box?
Oh.
yes!
It's been in my family for years.
Oh.
I hope it's worth something!
I'm sure it's worth a ton.
It's not worth a dime.
No.
I understand that.
I just want to know if he's happy with his current representation.
because if he isn't.
our firm is in an excellent position to provide-- I see.
Well.
when your daddy gets home.
have him call me.
What's the good word.
Tell me things.
I'm 5'11".
I'm not into games.
I like horseback riding.
skiing and men who aren't afraid to cry.
Okay.
you're not in the mood.
Ben.
I have been trying and trying.
but there is no-- Good Lord.
that walk from the elevator is gonna give me calf muscles like a Hungarian shot-putter!
Karen.
this isn't exactly a good time.
Yeah?
Well.
you're with you.
honey.
That's never a good time.
You left these at the office.
and Grace and I made a deal.
If I brought them over to you.
I could leave at 1 :00.
Grace doesn't know about the deal.
so keep it under your tupe.
Ben Doucette.
Karen Walker.
I know Mrs. Walker.
Oh.
yeah.
I remember you.
Stan and I met you at the Whitney opening.
You were the bartender!
Yeah.
No.
you just gave me your drink order.
Yeah.
And I'm still waiting for it.
Well.
I'm out of here.
Oh.
honey.
will you pop a stamp on this and drop it in the mail for me?
I like you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was coming.
She usually sends her flying monkeys.
Don't be sorry.
We've been chasing Walker lnc.
for years.
I had no idea you were this close to landing them.
Oh.
yeah.
Oh no.
sure.
I'm just working on reeling her in.
All I need now is a harpoon and a bucket of chum.
Will.
I don't care if you have to blow her out of the sea with dynamite.
Just make it happen.
Right.
I just-- I need a little more time.
Will.
did I tell you the story about the two guys who want to go out with you?
- No.
- They won't if you're fired by Friday.
- Hello.
Paul Archambeau.
- Grace Adler.
Just Jack.
Okay.
we've begun the filming.
so please just act natural.
So tell me about this lovely teapot.
Well.
we had a bit of a family tragedy last year.
I'm her brother.
not her lover.
Just-- On Christmas Eve.
Grandma Meg Iost both of her legs to diabetes.
Oh.
And then on Christmas Day.
she tragically lost both her feet.
So how does the teapot fit into all of this?
Well.
it's the only thing that survived the fire that Grandma caused when she mistakenly answered the iron.
With her hook.
Well.
Iet's see what we've got here.
shall we?
Ah yes.
well.
this appears to be a-- a Meissen teapot.
from I would say the early 18th century.
It's beautifully done.
although the gold in the scrollwork here is a little bit brighter than we usually see on these pieces.
Have you any idea how much this is worth?
Oh.
gosh.
I don't know.
We were hoping for Grandma's sake.
$5.000?
Well.
I hate to disappoint you.
but this is worth $30.000.
What?
You know what I'm going to do with my money?
Buy an Audi.
drive by Rory and yell "Loser"!
out the window.
I can't believe I have $30.000!
I can't believe I have $30.000.
Jack.
this is my teapot.
I bought it with my money and my expertise.
You thought it was fake.
Iesbian ceramic expert.
Besides.
you wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me.
Breaking through to Porcelain Paul was based on an idea by Jack McFarland.
- It's mine!
- It's mine!
- Give it to me!
- No.
it's mine!
Okay.
okay.
Wait a minute.
Look.
this is crazy.
We're friends.
We're in this together.
The only mature thing to do.
is just to sell it.
And split the money.
50-50.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
$15.000 is still a lot of money.
Yes.
but it won't buy an Audi.
Jack!
Thanks.
Smitty.
Mrs. Walker.
I hate to be indelicate.
but-- Oh.
right.
right.
right-- the tab.
Oh.
wait.
Now.
what was our agreement again?
One month or $1.000.
whichever comes first.
Oh.
my word.
has it been a month already?
No.
ma'am.
Smitty.
what's it all about?
Oh.
wait!
I don't give a crap!
Karen?
No.
Karen.
it's you.
I'm sorry.
you must have mistaken me for somebody else.
My name is Anastasia Beaverhausen.
Oh.
all right.
all right.
it's me!
What in the hell are you doing here?
Felt like a drink.
And.
you know.
sometimes you want to go where nobody knows your name.
Yeah.
well you're not going to like it here.
Nobody is going to serve you a drink in a leather thong and a dog collar.
Karen.
you're so funny.
I'm going to need a martini in a Big Gulp.
Excuse me!
Crazy woman.
Hide your teapots.
Jack!
Jack!
Come back here!
Jack!
Excuse me.
did you see a gay guy run through here with a teapot real excited?
What am I talking about?
It's like asking if you've ever seen a loser at a Renaissance Fair.
Can you see me?
Yes.
Tommy.
I can see you.
Oh my God.
angry lesbians coming at you!
Jack!
It's really quite lovely.
Have you any idea how much it's worth?
I don't know.
We found it in the attic.
A couple hundred?
Well.
actually.
it's worth approximately $25.000.
Oh!
I believe this is yours.
Okay.
so.
how'd you get that scar?
Oh.
that one-- I got that one playing hockey.
I got burned playing with my cousin's EZ-Bake oven.
- Okay.
my EZ-Bake oven.
- Okay!
And what about that one right there near the site of future hair plugs?
Um yeah.
that's a physical and emotional scar.
I-- - You know what?
I'd rather not.
- Oh.
come on!
No fair!
I showed you where Rosario planted a bite mark on my ankle.
All right.
I--  I sang "I Honestly Love You".
Oh!
Honey.
Olivia Newton-John?
No.
Yeah.
yeah.
Totally humiliating.
My voice cracked.
naturally.
and everybody laughed.
I ran off stage.
and tripped and fell into Stephanie Lieberman's head gear.
Oh.
Worst day of my life.
Not so great for Stephanie.
either.
Well.
get a load of this beauty.
Karen.
there's no scar.
That's just your thigh.
Yeah.
It's pretty good.
right?
Look at us!
Having cocktails and trading war stories.
Gosh.
I'm almost on the verge of not disliking you.
- I'll keep that one under my tupe.
- Oh!
Karen.
the last time you and I had drinks together.
you and Stan were kind of hitting a rough patch.
How are things?
Well.
he has his wing.
I have mine.
Steady as she goes.
Oh.
good.
I'm glad you're happy.
Now.
are you and Stan happy with your lawyers?
Well.
I don't know.
I mean.
I haven't really thought-- wait a minute.
Is that what this is about?
You're trying to get Stan as a client!
Are you working me.
Wilma?
All right.
I admit it.
I'm a little desperate.
I have to land a high-profile client by tomorrow.
Is there any way you could set up a meeting?
This is the meeting.
You want anything to do with Walker lnc.
you got to go through Mrs. Inc. So.
how badly do you want it?
Very badly.
Badly enough to suck that peanut off the table?
- Karen.
I'm not gonna-- - Suck it!
- There is no-- - Suck it!
God.
I hope that was a peanut.
Okay.
what do you say?
I say you didn't get on that peanut fast enough.
Oh.
c'mon.
Kar-- what is it going to take?
Excuse me.
Hello.
Ladies and gentlemen.
we have a special treat this evening.
Yes.
the menthol-cool stylings of Mr. Will Truman.
Oh.
no.
no.
no.
no.
Absolutely not.
"I Honestly Love You".
in a high key.
Check.
please.
Can I get the check?
- Want to be my lawyer?
-  Then sing me a love song.
And make me believe it.
Lady.
you are out of your mind.
If you think I'm going to stand here-- Maybe I hang around here a little more than I should We both know I got somewhere else to go On the piano and put a little Michelle Pfeiffer in it.
I got something to tell you I never thought I would But I believe you really ought to know Arch your back and lick your lips.
I love you I honestly love you Okay.
I'm starting to buy it.
Now make him believe it.
You don't have to ans-- all right.
that's it!
I'm done!
I am a damn good lawyer and you would be lucky to have me.
I don't have to put up with this crap.
You're sadistic and bitter and empty.
Oh.
and by the way.
your thigh not so hot.
Goodbye.
desk.
Goodbye.
oddly hanging tonsu.
Goodbye.
50-foot Calvin Klein underwear ad.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Good morning.
Truman.
Ooh.
hoo.
hoo.
I had a great night last night.
If anybody asks.
I was with you.
So?
Look.
Ben.
I tried my hardest.
I did every-- you have no idea what I've been through.
but l-- Please.
put all the details in a memo.
which I won't read.
I stopped by to congratulate you.
Karen Walker signed the papers this morning.
And for future reference.
this is my happy face.
Ka-- Karen's here?
Hi.
honey.
Close your mouth.
You look like you're missing a chromosome.
Good job.
Will.
Mrs. Walker.
always a pleasure.
- Anything we can do to help?
- Yeah.
I'm still waiting on that drink.
Something tells me you haven't been waiting.
Why did you do it?
Oh.
I don't know.
I like Grace.
Grace likes you.
Smitty likes me.
I like Cutty Sark.
That is one polluted stream of consciousness.
And I just figured that anyone who'd sing an Olivia Newton-John song for me would be the kind of lawyer who-- oh Lord.
honey.
don't make me think about it too much.
I might change my mind.
What's that?
You know what I think?
I think you're still on the verge of not disliking me.
No.
no.
no.
we don't do that.
Not on my time.
That's a billable smile.
Wilma.
Karen.
wait.
About those things I said last night.
I'm-- I'm really sorry.
What things.
honey?
Well.
when I said-- Maybe I didn't say anything.
I didn't think so.
So.
can your lawyer take you to lunch?
Honey.
I don't eat with the help.
okay?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Yes.
Intel is up 2.5 points.
Yes!
My gym just got trampolines.
Last night.
when Mitch and I were celebrating our half-week-aversary Stan caught us doing a little somethin'-somethin' on his Viking oven.
Ooh.
Sort of "homo on the range".
He was so shocked.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack.
What-- what 'd he say?
"Excuse me.
boys.
I think I left my uh-- oh.
good night".
He ran out so fast.
he forgot his snack cakes.
Poor guy.
came down for a Ding Dong and found a couple of Twinkies.
Can l-- can I borrow $600 to pay some bills?
No.
I had the weirdest dream last night.
I was on a beach.
dancing with Chow Yun-Fat.
Then all of a sudden.
he rips his face off.
and it's Chow Yun-Fat in a different mood.
What do you think that means?
I think it means a grown woman should never wear pigtails.
Yeah.
What's that about.
Pippi?
You know?
I really didn't want to be invited to the bitch brunch.
And besides.
I ran out of conditioner.
It was either this or a turban.
- Turban.
- Turban.
- How about $100?
- Not a chance.
Oh.
I forgot to tell you.
keep Sunday night open.
Big night.
Claire is coming to town.
Claire?
Oh my God!
I finally get to meet the best friend from high school.
Oh my God.
Claire Danes?
That's huge.
Yes.
Jack.
Claire Danes.
Did I not mention that 19-year-old Claire Danes is my best friend from high school?
Ah.
aha.
you're bloated.
Claire.
I mentioned her a thousand times.
Claire lives in Paris.
works in fashion.
She was my Grace before I met Grace.
Claire Nope.
doesn't ring a bell.
Cla.
cla.
cla-- I don't like her name.
though.
I'm gonna call her Bettina.
"Yay!
Bettina's coming to town"!
It's much better.
You know.
I'm gonna have to ask her about your pre-gay days.
What are you talking about?
You knew me when I was pre-gay.
No.
I knew you when you were on the cusp.
when you made me go to Chippendale's every Saturday night because you said they made a killer Mai Tai.
Speaking of alcohol Honey.
what's with this place?
You're a lawyer.
Why are you living in the projects?
I like to be close to my homies at Zabar's.
Yeah.
they make a smoked sable that is da bomb.
By your inflection.
I can tell that you think what you're saying is funny but no.
Come on.
poodle.
Iet's go.
We're going to that celebrity fashion show at the Four Seasons.
I hope E!
'll be there.
I want to kmeet Steve Kmetko.
- Karen-- - Honey.
what's going on here?
By the look of this hair.
I think this little piggy should stay home.
Okay?
Karen.
what are you doing here?
You called in sick this morning.
Okay.
formalities are over.
You're a decorator.
I work in fashion.
Girls on the go.
happiness.
blah-blah-blah.
When did you know Will was gay?
Oh.
can we talk about something else.
please?
No.
Well.
my first inkling was when he put his hand on my boob and said "Ooh.
is this cashmere"?
How about you?
Okay.
Cristina Aguilera or Britney Spears?
Who's got the staying power?
That was one lame attempt at a subject change.
All right.
it was after senior prom.
We were driving to the beach.
Top down.
warm night.
his feathered hair motionless in the wind.
And I make my move.
I lean in real close and start kissing him.
Yeah.
and I panic.
I figure I've gotta do something to distract her.
so l-- I did the only logical thing.
I crashed into a Dodge Dart.
You crashed into a car?
It was a Dodge Dart.
I was doing somebody a favor.
It was a confusing time.
I didn't know myself till sophomore year.
I was playing basketball and Jay Barr and I went up for a rebound.
Our stomachs touched.
and by the time I came down.
I was gay.
Oh.
you guys.
I hate to be a party pooper almost as much as I hate to say "party pooper".
- But I'm exhausted.
- Will: Mmm.
and I feel you are moments away from pulling out the yearbook.
- Oh.
please.
- Give us a little credit.
So that's where that's been.
- Oh.
so great to finally meet you.
- Oh.
you too.
And thanks for taking such great care of him.
And thank you for passing the flame to me.
so to speak.
Hey.
what are you doing?
Umm.
I'm thinking about moving this vase from here to here.
D'you think that'll throw off the whole room?
Actually.
I think what might be throwing off the whole room is all these boxes.
You've been here six months already.
Decorator.
unpack thyself.
So?
How was the rest of your evening with Claire?
- Interesting.
- Ah.
Will.
she is so great.
Cool and smart and funny and stylish and feel free to jump in at any point to tell me how great she thought I was.
She loved you.
Dame Needy.
So.
what'd you guys talk about?
You know.
work and high school.
How much she wants to have a baby.
- Oh.
she would make such a great mom.
- I think so.
too.
She asked a friend of hers to donate sperms.
so she can have one.
- What'd he say?
- I said I'd think about it.
- What?
-  Wow.
- I mean.
wow!
- I know.
Big wow.
And-- and l-- I've been up all night.
thinking about it.
and l I think I'm gonna do it.
- Really?
!
- Definitely.
I mean.
Claire's one of my oldest friends.
You said she should make a great mom.
- I did say that.
- She's not in a relationship.
and she wants a baby more than anything.
and this is my chance to Iend a helping hand-- Iet me rephrase that.
I mean how great would it be to have another another little Will.
running around out there?
I mean.
we love me.
right?
We do love you.
- I'm doing it!
- Ooh!
Sure.
It's easier than giving a kidney.
I'd imagine the procedure is much more pleasant.
I knew you'd get this.
Oh I'm gonna call her right now.
I'm so excited!
- I was just about to call you.
- I couldn't wait.
- Come in.
- So.
wow.
I really love your place.
I really love what you've done with it.
- You were just here last night.
- I know.
I'm nervous.
I'm babbling.
Help me.
- I'll do it.
- Really?
- You're gonna be a fabulous mom!
- Aah!
Thank you so much!
I feel like I should get you something.
I don't know.
what do you get somebody for something like this?
You need a wallet?
It's fine.
I'm happy to do it.
Now.
I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you or anything.
but - I leave on Tuesday and I'm blue.
- Tuesday?
Now I'm blue.
What I mean is spring has sprung.
The egg's comin' right over the plate.
So.
if you could go down to this sperm bank on your lunch break Oh.
I was really more in the mood for soup and salad.
Is this happening too fast?
Now.
are you okay with this?
I was kidding.
Oh.
I can't tell you what this means to me.
- You are such a good friend.
-  Do you ever touch men?
Jack.
this is my friend Claire.
French Claire?
Parlez-vous français?
Ah.
Tu parles français.
Je n'ai pas sais que tu comprends la langue.
Ah.
oui.
Vaw-vuh-faw.
ah.
fah-fah-fah-fah.
Faw-faw.
fav-ah-fav-ah-fav-ah.
agh.
fav-ah.
fo-fah Claire.
this is Charlie Brown's French teacher.
You are so Euro-fabulous.
Love it.
Iove it.
Iove it more!
Quel hottie.
I'm guessing you're a high maintenance kind of friend.
I cost a little more.
but I'm worth it.
- I got to go.
- All right.
Oh.
just so you know.
your name's Bettina now.
It's better.
Nescafe?
Uh Sanka.
Okay.
Jack.
I need to talk to you and I need you to be someone other than Jack.
God.
you're like the fourth person who's said that to me today.
Imagine that.
Sit down.
Claire asked me to help her have a baby.
Mitch and I have a date.
Are you using your apartment tonight?
Are you listening to me?
She asked me to help her have a baby!
I'm a little freaked out here.
Of course you're freaked out.
You can't just start sleeping with women.
Who are you.
Anne Heche?
Giving the gift of life is a wonderful thing.
I myself have put my macho gazpacho out there once or twice.
Like.
I mean.
I've got to do this in like three hours.
and and and l-- Look-look-look-look.
Bettina's one of our favorite people.
We love her.
We trust her.
and she really wants to have this baby.
right?
- More than anything.
- Women who want kids that badly are the kind of women you want having children.
Right?
So forget about everything else.
You're doing a good thing.
I am.
- You're right.
thank you.
- You're welcome.
- How about $50?
- Forget it.
Okay.
I have a problem.
I don't want your opinion about it.
but I do want to tell you what it is.
but I don't want your advice on it.
because it's always wrong.
Okay.
Honey.
can I comment on those Pilgrim pumps?
No.
Okay.
Will is making the biggest mistake of his life.
He has an old high school friend who lives in France.
She wants to have a baby.
and Will is going to give her his sperm.
Now.
first of all.
Will is not really the kind of guy who could just give something away and not think about it.
He gave me his NYU sweatshirt three years ago.
and he still stops by at least once a week to say.
"How's it doing"?
I mean.
and dont' get me wrong.
I mean.
Claire.
she's nice.
she's great.
but wh-- what is it with friends showing up I mean.
I don't know about you.
but I never wrote in anyone's yearbook.
"Don't ever change.
and please fill this cup".
It's a mistake.
He'll regret it.
That's all I'm saying.
Anyway.
thanks for listening.
And thank you for keeping your opinion to yourself.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ho.
ho.
Mmm Okay!
Okay.
you can talk now!
Thank God.
Okay.
first of all.
the shoes go back on the Mayflower.
And second of all.
you're just upset because this woman stole your B plan.
What?
You know what?
I don't want to even know what you mean by that.
If you want to tell me.
I know I can't stop you.
Honey.
when it comes to potential mates.
I This is hard for me to say.
but you date losers.
Hey.
that wasn't so hard.
Okay.
For your information.
I have gone out with some really great Continue.
I think that even you know that there's not one of those guys that you would even consider having a kid with.
Oh.
really?
Well.
maybe that is because you never met Continue.
Come on.
Iet's face it.
honey.
You always thought you'd have Will as a backup.
and now your husband's having kids with someone else.
And what are the chances he's gonna give it away twice.
huh?
And even if he does.
she'll have gotten the good stuff.
It's like a Cabernet.
the first batch is always the best.
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.
Wait.
that analogy doesn't really link up.
Maybe not.
but a glass of red wine sounds good right now.
Karen.
take me to your dentist.
I feel my teeth are dull and people are laughing at me.
Oh.
Jack.
that's not why people are laughing.
Hey.
don't crank on me just 'cause Will's down at the sperm bank on 33rd.
unloading the contents of his vas deferens into a Dixie Cup.
- That's happening today?
- Yeah.
Better run.
honey.
or your B plan'll be kaput by the stroke of one.
if you know what I mean.
"If you know what I mean".
This is where it all happens.
huh?
Man.
if these walls could talk.
They'd probably say.
"Glad I'm not the floor".
Being funny isn't going to get the job done.
Come on in.
- Here's your cup.
- Wow!
Great expectations.
There are magazines here if you need them and some movies.
so.
party on.
So.
you're from around here?
Booties and Juggs and Cans.
Oh my!
If you happen to have an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog out there.
we might free up this room a whole lot faster.
How about this?
Can you use that?
"Martha Stewart Living"?
Let me explain my people to you.
Um.
we enjoy.
but are not turned on by the perfect scone.
Just put the junk in the cup.
It's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna find anything eh-- "New England Carpenters".
Thank you.
Lord.
Whatever you're doing.
stop!
What the hell are you doing here?
I just thought that you might want to try that new Thai place.
- Ju-- get out of here!
- Let-- okay.
okay.
okay.
okay.
Just-- just one thing.
okay?
You can't go through with this.
- Not with you standing here.
- You can't give your sperm to Claire.
Because because that sperm is mine.
Sorry.
but I'm pretty sure the doggone sperm is mine.
Yeah.
but I took that sperm to movies.
I schlepped it through Europe.
I bought it a little gel seat for your bike.
Yeah.
but what are you trying to say?
That you want to have a baby with me?
No!
I don't know!
Maybe!
I mean I guess I guess l I just want the option.
I mean I mean.
what happens if l if I never meet anybody?
I mean.
shouldn't I at least get first dibs?
I mean.
isn't that one of the privileges of the straight girl-gay guy relationship?
Shouldn't you be my fallback sperm?
Look.
Iet me get this straight.
You would sacrifice Claire's happiness just on the off chance that one day-- in the distant future.
you might.
just maybe.
need to call upon my little guys in top hats?
Yes.
And the fact that I might feel good about helping a friend.
doesn't even factor into your thought process?
- Yes.
- And that this is about my life.
meaning not your life.
and Claire's life.
again not your life.
is meaningless to you?
Um yes.
Look.
you were the one who always said that every feeling is valid and I should share it with you.
- And-- and I would like to amend that.
- To what?
To "You selfish lunatic.
get out of my spermatorium".
- Hi.
- Hi.
About this afternoon.
I am sorry.
It's your life.
You do what you want.
It's not my place to say-- - I couldn't do it.
- Oh.
my.
thank God.
I mean.
what happened?
I just kept thinking about you.
- Um.
thanks.
- No!
I meant-- I I kept thinking of what you said about me being your fallback sperm.
- Just as an option.
- You're not going to need the option.
You're fantastic.
and you're gonna meet someone fantastic.
and you're gonna have a million babies of your own.
Yeah.
I guess.
But what did happen.
and why didn't-- why didn't you do it?
Well.
because you're my fallback egg.
Sweetie.
you're not gonna need me.
You're fantastic.
and you're gonna meet someone fantastic and you're gonna have a million babies of y-- wait a minute.
What am I saying?
- You're totally gonna need me.
- Oh.
yeah.
I'm not going to the gym just to wind up with stretch marks.
I tell you that.
I told Claire.
that-- you know.
that if I ever have a baby I want it to be with you.
I mean.
if there's gonna be a little Will running around out there.
I want him to be a little Will and a little Grace.
- Really?
- Little Grace.
Oh my God.
that is so sweet.
- The two of us having a kid!
- I know.
And Derek.
my boyfriend.
- Derek.
Have I met him?
- Neither one of us has.
- He's a carpenter in New England.
- Ah!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Will.
you asleep?
Will!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
did I wake you?
Oh.
it's okay.
I had to get up anyway.
'cause there was someone at my bedroom door screaming "Will".
I'm so sorry.
I just-- I couldn't sleep.
I have this presentation tomorrow and l-- you know what?
Now that-- now that I've woken you up.
you look tired.
- Go back to sleep.
- Oh.
come here!
You always get nuts before something like this.
and you're always great.
They're going to love it.
How come you always know exactly the right thing to say?
'Cause I'm incredibly sensitive.
and because you had the exact same problem last week.
Could you-- just pour the milk?
It's cereal.
not dynamite!
I don't want it to get too soggy.
I hate when they go "snap.
crackle.
poop".
Hey.
panic mode.
Clear a path.
My 10:00 was moved to 9:00.
so I only have like three minutes to eat.
Thanks.
Isn't it great how sugar has no fat in it?
Now.
Grace.
if you want to lose weight.
try my diet.
Whenever I want to eat.
I've a friend come over and steal my food.
Jack and Grace: He's talking about you.
Oh.
I gotta run.
I'm late.
I've got like nine bites left.
so I'll just leave the bowl with the doorman.
What was that about.
Flinchy?
What do you mean?
You flinched.
Flinchy.
Psst.
Wifey tried to give you a smooch and you flinched.
What's the matter.
Flinchy?
- Trouble in paradise?
- No.
Do you ever have dreams about women?
- Sure.
Bette.
Barbra.
Liza.
- No, no.
I mean sex dreams.
Uh.
no.
And why would you?
You mean Grace?
She doesn't even have an album.
It's only been a couple of weeks.
but it's-- - it's kind of got me weirded out.
- Weirded out?
Hi.
try disgusted.
Oh.
God!
lpecac.
I need ipecac.
You know.
what frightens me.
Jack.
is that I'm the only person in the world who knows that this is you helping.
Just give me a minute to get the image out of my head.
all right?
Ricky Martin in gauchos.
Ricky Martin in gauchos.
Away.
That was easy.
Well.
once again.
you've helped me navigate the tricky rapids of my life.
and I thank you.
And I do take full responsibility.
You're in love with me.
you can't have me.
you're fat.
ergo Grace.
It all lines up perfectly.
Please.
I want you to seek professional help.
Professional he-- hey.
that's the pot calling the kettle taupe.
You mean a therapist?
I don't need a therapist.
Fine.
Live in denial.
I tell you.
I've seen a lot of sick male-female relationships in my time.
but yours.
my friend.
is by far the sickest.
Now.
if you'll excuse me.
I have to go get my wife some bunion cream.
I do not need a therapist.
So.
in the dream.
how do you feel?
I feel like I'm having sex with a woman.
And as a gay man Iet's just say there were things there that I wish weren't there and one thing that isn't there that I really kind of miss.
Is that your last patient?
Look.
I wouldn't take these dreams literally.
- It's probably not about sex at all.
- Really?
Naked bodies entwined.
nails clawing my back?
You know.
I get Showtime.
That's sex.
What I mean is.
most dreams are metaphorical.
They almost always represent some other underlying problem.
In this case.
maybe a problem with Grace.
- So it's not really about sex at all?
- Not likely.
Oh.
that's good.
Starting to think I was going a little woo-hoo.
That's probably not the technical term.
No.
I believe the technical term is neuro-ebhr-br-br-br disorder.
So.
tell me.
what's going on in your life?
Is there something that feels out of balance.
or maybe you're conflicted about something?
I don't think so.
Maybe I am.
No.
I'm not.
Yes.
you are.
What do you know?
Shut up.
No.
you shut up.
Papa can you hear me?
Sorry.
Went a little mental with Yentl.
That's-- that-- that's a rhyming game that Grace and l-- forget it.
You'd have to know her.
Well.
on that topic.
how do you feel about bringing Grace into this discussion?
Sure.
What do you want to know about her?
No.
I mean here in the room.
A session with both of you.
You're bored with me.
aren't you?
The magic is gone.
No.
I think I might just get a better understanding of what your dynamic is together.
I do this with a number of my patients.
But I don't want to talk about the dreams.
I wouldn't want to talk to anyone I was having sex dreams about.
Although.
I don't actually know Stone Phillips.
This is your journey.
Grace doesn't have to know.
I don't think I'm really comfortable with that.
It's your choice.
However.
you should know.
unless you get to the root of these dreams.
they're probably gonna become more frequent.
Wednesday morning good for you?
Oh.
Cha-Cha.
that's good.
- Hi.
Poodle.
- Who's your daddy?
You are.
Okay.
come on.
Rosario.
up.
up-up-up-up.
I need you to whip up a batch of cosmos.
The Bronfmans came back from the party with us.
and I don't like 'em when they're sober.
Why don't I just squeeze you like a sponge?
There's enough alcohol in you to fill a hot tub.
Okay.
up.
up.
up-up-up-up.
Up.
Karen.
you can't work her that hard.
She's been on her feet all day.
Oh my God.
I'm so Norma Rae.
Leave her alone.
Oh.
well.
Iook at you.
Sticking up for your Mexican mama.
Huh.
you like that?
I told you.
Iady.
I'm from EI Salvador.
Blah.
blah.
Shift it!
Come on!
Karen.
she's not going.
Excuse me?
Mink trumps felt.
Okay?
Okay?
It's okay.
Cha-Cha.
I don't mind.
Hmm?
Lady.
tonight you better sleep with one eye open.
Honey.
I haven't slept since 1972.
but thank you!
Listen to me.
As Rosario's legally endowed husband.
I am putting my foot down.
You'd better start treating her with some respect or else.
Jack.
Iet me paint you a little picture of life here at Chez Walker.
You may want to sit down for this.
Nobody matters but me.
Good night.
So.
Grace.
did Will tell you why you're here?
No.
not exactly.
I mean.
he said he was anxious and can't sleep.
So.
what.
is he anxious because of me?
Is that the point to all of this?
No.
This is really about Will.
By seeing your dynamic first hand.
I can gain some insight into Will and Will's issues.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
So with that in mind.
Iet's talk about Will.
But every time I try to get close to my sister.
she just-- she hits me with all of this rage.
I mean.
Iike-- Iike it-- Iike it's my fault she was a binge eater.
Like it's my fault that my mother made her wear ankle weights to vacuum the living room.
Grace.
you were in no way responsible for-- for her slow metabolism or her epic ass.
You're right.
Thank you.
Actually.
I feel a little better.
Whoa.
I've so got to run.
Am I allowed to-- to end the session.
or is that something you're supposed to do?
I have control issues.
We'll talk about that next time!
If I say we talk about it.
I'll see you at home.
I have to make a call.
Okay.
Thanks.
Doc.
- Do you mind if I use your phone?
- Help yourself.
Hello.
Hello?
Oh.
good.
it works.
Okay-- I'm expecting a really important call and my phone sucks.
So l-- Bye.
Call me.
You must think I'm a little woo-hoo.
Actually.
I think you're adorable.
I never thought I would like therapy.
you know.
'cause I don't know.
I've always hated Dr. Laura.
But it's great.
You know.
it's like a talk show and I'm the only guest.
I'm always in the hot seat.
I never have to move to the end of the couch.
Except for that time that Joan Embry showed up with a spider monkey.
-  - See?
Proof it's working.
I'm actually connecting with Karen.
Minnie Driver.
who ever told you you could pull off a leather jumpsuit?
So.
you never told me.
My therapist.
do you like him?
Sure.
Sure.
I like him.
Why wouldn't I like him?
I mean.
I like him like I like the Statue of Liberty.
I'm glad it's there but I don't need to see it all the time.
Interesting analogy.
Which reminds me.
Get out.
already.
So you-- you want to grab a little ltalian tonight?
Maybe even have dinner first?
I can't.
I already have plans.
You little minx.
Third time this week.
You know me.
Adios.
amiga.
You gonna tell me who the mystery man is?
Um.
You know.
it's-- it's still early.
I don't want to jinx it if that's okay.
All right.
I can respect that.
Karen.
always a joy.
Ieaving you.
Okay.
Karen.
I need you to fax this over to-- So you're boinking the head doctor.
aren't you?
No.
I know that you always like to think that you are right.
but I am not boinking the head doctor.
But there has been a little over-the-sweater action.
Oh my God.
How did you?
Was your mother a jackal.
by any chance?
Oh.
honey.
come on!
I always know when you're getting a little - How?
- Honey.
it's in my bones.
The same way that I know that that outfit is a fiesta del failure.
I mean.
what was I supposed to do?
I just stayed after the session to use the phone.
smiles were exchanged.
he called me "adorable".
and the next thing I know.
my phone number ended up on his palm.
Among other things.
Okay.
okay.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking it is wrong and inappropriate to go out with Will's therapist.
But consider this-- I'm not gonna sleep with him.
Even though he's dying to.
Because that would be inappropriate.
Even though he's dying to.
But I'm not gonna do it.
Even though he's dying to.
Not gonna.
Dying to.
Oh.
honey.
what it must be like to live inside that head.
- Hi.
Poodle.
- Mm.
how are you?
Hi.
Grace.
Who's your daddy?
His name is Martin Adler.
You're so funny and pretty.
I don't tell you that enough.
do l?
No.
- Blouse?
- Loehmann's.
- Shoes?
- Nine West.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute.
What the hell is going on here?
Hey.
take Jackie to Blimpie's.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
As much as I would love a huge salami hoagie at 10:45 in the morning.
I can't.
I'll take you to lunch.
honey.
You should've thought of that when you woke Rosario up at 5:00 a.m. this morning to coat Stan with Tinactin.
Oh.
oh.
come on.
Jack.
No!
Rosario made your bed.
now lie in it.
So then my-- my mom gets on the line.
and my dad totally shuts down.
and in a flash.
I'm back in their house again.
I'm 16 years old.
Did you have this sex dream about Grace again last night?
Uh.
yeah.
Yeah.
So-so-so-so anyway.
my mom and I get into it.
and finally.
for the first time in my life.
I was able to say.
"Would you please just let the man speak"?
!
That's good.
I think that's-- that's good.
I wonder if it's something you're doing to get her into bed.
I mean.
You know.
in the dream?
I th-- I thought we were talking about my parents.
You're avoiding the issue.
I want to know what you did to get Grace into bed.
In-- in the dream.
I didn't do anything.
She was just there.
Fine.
then let's broaden the scope.
What does one do to get Grace into bed?
What?
How is that relevant?
Because if you're doing things that are similar to what other men have done to get her into bed.
aren't you in some way culpable?
Are you saying.
that I want to sleep with Grace?
All I'm saying is.
in the dream.
are you doing the things other men do to get Grace into bed?
- Like what?
- You tell me!
What do other men do to get her into bed?
I mean.
what does it take?
I don't know.
A nice dinner.
flowers?
- No!
- I beg your pardon?
I mean.
I mean.
no.
no.
I think you're missing the central issue here.
That wasn't a "No.
you're missing the central issue".
that's a "No.
I ain't getting any".
You're having sex with Grace!
Of this I am certain-- I am not having sex with Grace.
Even if sex includes a little over-the-sweater action?
- If you're gonna cast that wide a net-- - You scum!
You're angry with me.
Good.
But wasn't it Grace that came into your therapy session and turned it into a dating service?
Yeah.
with you.
This is about you.
not Grace.
She's doing what she always does.
making every situation about her.
- That's why you're having those dreams.
- No.
Yes.
What?
Really?
Yes.
in the dream.
her needs are being met.
Mine aren't.
If they were.
it wouldn't be Grace in bed with me.
it would be Stone Phillips.
Iike it used to be.
You can ring my bell - Ring my bell - Ding dong Ring-a-ling-a-ling.
Hi.
honey.
how is your day going?
Same old.
same old.
Uh.
what are you ironing?
Those are real pretty.
They're your napkins.
Well.
they're just beautiful.
Uh.
so.
Iisten.
Rosario.
I've been thinking.
you know.
maybe we should do more stuff together.
I don't drink.
Uh.
well.
then how's abouts we go down to Niketown and pick you up a kicky new pair of fun.
huh?
- Just us girls.
come on.
- Lady.
you're giving me the creeps.
What's going on here?
Listen.
Rosie.
Iet me explain.
Esta mañana.
Señora Boozehound y yo.
- vamos a la playa para-- - In English.
If you prefer.
We had a little talk.
and Karen has decided that from now on.
she's gonna treat you.
my wild Latin rose.
Iike a decent human being.
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
honey.
Then I quit.
Karen and Jack: What?
!
I didn't sign on to work for a decent human being.
I signed on to work with Miss Karen.
You ungrateful little  Oh.
honey.
it's good to be back.
Oh.
don't ever leave me.
cupcake.
Well.
I guess everybody's happy.
Sorry to throw you off.
I forgot that even though harsh words are exchanged sometimes.
underneath it all is love.
Hmm.
- I totally had you going there.
- You kill me.
chica.
Both: Whoa!
- Who's your daddy?
- You are.
Okay.
this has been driving me crazy.
and I can't keep it in any longer.
There's something I really need to tell you.
- I have been dating your shrink.
- Dating my shrink.
How did you know?
Well.
Iet's just say he's used my sessions to figure out a way to get into Graceland.
Very fun for me at 150 bucks an hour.
Oh!
I am so sorry!
I am terrible.
- There is no defense.
- None.
But if there was.
it would be that I only went out with him a few times.
I never slept with him.
and I'm gonna stop seeing him because the guilt has been killing me.
Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
Grace-- I don't want to talk about you.
I don't want to talk about my therapist.
I'd like to talk about me.
Can we just make this about me.
for once?
What do you mean "for once"?
You have a way of making every situation about you.
- I do not.
- Oh.
really?
Item-- Iast month when I had bronchitis.
you made me do an herbal steam.
We ended up in the emergency room because you thought you were allergic to eucalyptus.
My feet were swollen to the size of canoes.
Stop trying to squeeze into a size six.
European sizes run big!
Item-- you take my cereal and make it your cereal.
I have blood sugar issues.
Try food shopping.
Item-- you're dating my shrink!
I-- I-- oh my God.
I do that.
I did that.
Oh my God.
I'm horrible!
I've got to start going to a therapist to figure out why I do this.
- You're doing it again.
- Oh my God.
I am.
Oh.
I am.
Oh.
bad.
Bad.
bad.
bad.
bad.
bad.
bad.
Oh.
come on.
Frances.
- I am awful.
- Yes.
you are sometimes.
But your obsessive devotion to your own neurotic needs is part of what makes you wonderful.
- Really?
- Yes.
All I'm asking is that once in a while you check in with me.
Okay.
I will.
- How was your day?
- You don't have to start now.
No.
No.
I really want to know.
Okay.
well.
the-- - the cute deli guy at Balducci's - Mm-hmm.
gave me extra ham.
which.
as we all know.
is food-service-guy code for "I dig ya".
Got a great seat on the subway.
work was good.
and now I'm just looking forward to a full night's sleep without the dreams.
What dreams?
I'm sick of talking about me.
Let's talk about you.
Oh.
sweetie.
not agai-- Come on in.
Stone.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Oh.
my dad's here.
my dad's here.
He's just parking his rental car.
Got a spot on 78th.
Very impressive.
Look at him.
He's such a cute little parallel parker.
Oh.
there's the door.
Oh.
he's getting out of the car.
Oh.
he Asian.
Okay.
that's not my dad.
Look at you.
Mr. Happy Boots.
I wish I got this excited when my dad came to visit me.
- Come on.
your dad's great.
- Yeah.
in a parallel universe where my hair is straight and so are you.
How about that time you got into Columbia and he threw you a big party?
That was your dad.
When I told my dad I got into Columbia.
he said.
"Yeah.
well we're broke.
Now move.
you're blocking 'Baretta'".
Ah.
fathers.
Yeah.
Mine withheld affection from me for 30 years.
Then I find out he's not really my father and my whole life has been a big lie.
I'm sorry did I bring everybody down?
Jack.
I don't know what to say.
except-- -  - My dad's here.
yeah!
- Will.
- Pop!
- Hey-- - Give me that coat.
come on.
- Look at you.
you look great.
- Thank you.
- That my sweater?
- No.
Grandma sent this to me - Iast Christmas.
- She took it from me.
The woman's gettin' old.
Will.
I'm tellin' you.
she's gettin' old.
- Hello.
beautiful.
- Hello.
George.
Hey.
you workin' out?
Oh.
you know.
when I can fit it in.
Twice a day.
six days a week.
And who looks more like Rita Hayworth every day.
huh?
Oh.
George.
you're gonna spoil me.
- The other Rita Hayworth.
- Will: Come here.
- Oh.
my father is so bad.
- Good to see you.
sweetheart.
I'm never giving my father another Father's Day present ever again.
Ever.
Grace.
don't Bogart the dad.
huh?
- You want something to eat?
- No.
no.
don't bother.
I'm not hungry.
Unless you got.
maybe Iike a sandwich.
- Make that two.
- Yeah.
you know.
don't bother.
- I'll nibble.
- I'll still have mine.
Sure.
Jack.
how about a fat chance on rye?
Oh.
I almost forgot.
Here.
- Oh.
Dad-- - It's nothing.
it's a little something.
- Absolutely nothing.
- Ah!
- I saw it.
it seemed like you.
- Oh Only smaller and flatter and fuzzier.
I love it.
thank you.
The only thing my dad ever gave me was feet the size of canoes.
Hey.
don't get too attached to that.
I have a coat of yours that would go perfect with it.
- Well.
I must away.
- Got a hot date.
Jackie?
No.
but the guy who's dating me does.
See.
I keep telling you.
Iearn from this man.
Follow him around.
Do what he does.
Yeah.
I'm sure you'd be very happy to see me dancing on a box in a sequined tube top.
George.
if you ever get tired of him.
you'll be exactly like me.
Chow mein.
So.
George.
why are you in town?
Well.
the company's giving me an award for.
uh I don't know.
workin' there and not dyin'.
An award?
You said it was just a business dinner.
- I wanna come.
- No.
no.
no.
don't come.
nobody's coming.
Your brothers are busy.
Mom's taking care of Grandma.
nobody's coming.
- Are the Burtons coming?
- Yeah.
- B.J. and Chuck?
- Yeah.
- Buzz and Rita and Sherman-- - Yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
nobody's coming.
Well.
I wanna come.
Don't be silly.
it's already becoming a thing.
and I don't want it to blow up into a situation.
Now.
if you'll excuse me.
I gotta go to the john.
See that?
It's classic George Truman.
He says he doesn't want me to come.
but what he means is.
"I want you to come.
I just don't want to put you out".
Well.
my father's never invited me anywhere.
Except the time he had that lower G.I. series.
Don't think Norman Rockwell's gonna be paintin' that one.
No.
no.
Hey-- we should go.
you know.
and surprise him.
Yes.
yes.
We can go and we can hide under the table.
and when they say his name.
we can jump up and go.
"Surprise"!
Yeah.
and then Harpo and Zeppo could bring in the dean's wife and we'll all sail to Freedonia.
Hey.
don't knock it.
It was very funny when we did it in my dad's G.I. series.
Hi.
poodle.
- Who's your daddy?
- You are.
Who's my daddy?
Oh.
that's right.
some stranger in a Nixon mask who boinked my mother at a pool party in '68.
God.
that is awful.
Who in the world would have a pool party?
I don't know.
it's just seeing Will with his dad.
It feels like there's something missing in my life.
you know?
Like my soul is on empty.
You can go a lot of years on empty.
honey.
Trust me.
Come on.
Charge yourself a little happy.
No.
Karen.
Buying something's not gonna make me feel any better.
Although the new Prada slip-on wouldn't make me feel any worse.
Hey.
Jack.
How you doin'?
Sad.
Ionely.
fatherless.
Seconds away from recording a Country album.
Karen.
why are you laughing?
- He's in pain.
- Oh, I know.
He's miserable.
He doesn't know who his real father is.
it's terrible.
Oh.
oh.
oh.
wait a minute.
I get the joke.
Jack's all alone in the world.
Funny.
No.
no.
honey.
you don't understand.
I found him.
- I found Jack's daddy.
I did.
- What?
Yeah.
I had Private Detective do a little snooping around.
He was getting bored following Stan back and forth to Krispy Kreme anyway.
so - And it paid off.
- Wait a minute.
you found Jack's father?
Why didn't you tell him?
Well.
honey.
I'm working on a set-up here.
Tonight.
Jack is gonna meet his real daddy.
Again.
why didn't you tell him?
I know this may be an alien concept to you.
but it might have made another person happy.
Lord.
you are just as simple as that blouse you're wearing.
I am trying to create a moment here.
- Right.
So tell him that-- - I'm still talking.
- All I'm saying is-- - Quit interrupting me.
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.
Yes you are!
God.
honey.
I was just trying to tell you a little story.
Go.
Right now.
they're both in the dark.
However.
I am going to call them both and have them meet tonight at Jack's favorite coffee shop-- very mysterious.
very.
"Who am I meeting"?
okay?
And then.
I am going to arrive to make the big announcement.
"Jack.
there's a daddy in this room.
And I'm not talking Puff".
Okay?
It's so hip.
Oh.
so basically you made me feel like an idiot because you're making a father-son reunion all about you.
Honey.
I think maybe it's those pink go-go boots that are making you feel like an idiot.
Your father's gonna be so surprised.
I know.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
Where is he?
- Um.
Will?
- Huh?
You jumped into a tux.
popped a Tic Tac in your mouth.
took all of five seconds.
This took all afternoon.
It was like building a boat.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
you look great.
and if I had a bottle of champagne.
I'd smash it over your head.
That is so sweet.
Oh God.
what are you doing here?
Hi.
surprise!
We're here.
I know.
I got that.
Grace.
But I told you not to come.
I know.
it's your big night.
We should be here.
You shouldn't be here.
Go do something fun.
Go put on a sequined tube top.
Dance on a box.
Dad.
we're staying.
And why are you acting so weird?
- It's like you're hiding something.
- Of course I'm not hiding anything.
- It's just a little complicated.
- Will.
Ted Farmer.
- Oh.
hi.
- This must be your lovely wife.
Grace.
It's not that complicated.
Please.
I beg you.
can we not get into this right now?
- You haven't-- - How are you?
Good to see you.
- You haven't told them I'm gay?
- Do you walk around - telling your colleagues I'm straight?
- I think it's implied.
- I begged you not to come.
- But.
Dad-- Okay.
okay.
guys.
come on.
I'm sure this is nothing that can't be solved by-- me leaving.
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Shh shh shh.
- Don't make a scene.
- I don't make scenes.
Mom makes scenes.
I don't make scenes.
Oh my God.
I'm two highballs and a tight dress away from being Mom.
- You gotta understand something-- - I don't have to understand anything.
- I told you-- - Hey.
Mr. Truman.
Mr. Truman.
Will.
you must be so proud of your father.
Oh.
well proud doesn't begin to describe what I'm feeling.
- So.
could we borrow him for a minute?
- Please.
be my guest.
- I gotta-- - Yeah.
Here.
I got you this.
You probably just want to get out of here.
right?
No.
no.
no.
We're not going anywhere.
Oh.
you saw the rack of lamb?
No.
binge-o.
I want to talk to my father.
- Really?
Here?
- We are gonna deal with this tonight.
Wow.
Okay.
So until then we're married.
I guess that explains why you haven't touched me in 15 years.
Hi.
are you John Marshall?
- Yeah.
are you Jack McFarland?
- Last time I checked.
- Well.
nice to meet you.
- Yes.
it's nice to meet you as well.
Any idea why we're here?
I got a call from this woman.
Karen Walker.
and she said to be here at 8:00 'cause I was gonna meet someone - who would change my life.
- Wow.
I got the same phone call.
And I have a feeling she's right.
We have three kids.
Hannah.
Rachael and Liam.
Hannah played Queen Ester in the Purim play.
Woman: Ohh.
- Not a dry eye in shul.
- Okay.
- Sweetie.
Iet's dance.
- I don't feel like dancing.
- They're playing our song.
- Oh.
they have a song.
You two are so sweet together.
- What's your secret?
- I'm gay.
That's what our son says.
He's funny too.
What are you doing?
Waiting for you to talk to your father.
And by the way.
Dave in accounting has been giving me the eye all night.
I'm not above cheating on you.
Will.
come on.
Everyone has that moment when they realize that their parents are less than perfect.
And I hate to break it to you.
- but this is yours.
- Look.
I know my father.
okay?
And trust me.
he wouldn't do this unless he had a very good reason.
- Which is?
- I don't know.
But I intend to find out.
And we are not raising the kids Jewish.
It's steady work.
but you know.
I wouldn't be adverse to a change if the right opportunity came along.
Yeah.
interesting.
interesting.
You got good arms.
John.
You work out?
Yeah.
I try to.
Like I always say.
nobody likes a fatty.
Oh my God.
oh my God.
only my personal mantra.
Do you live alone?
Yeah.
uh Iook.
can you excuse me for a minute.
- I got a quick phone call.
- Okay.
sure.
I'll be right here.
Okay.
Hurry back though.
you don't want me to get cold.
Oh.
oh.
honey.
honey.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Is John here?
- Yes.
We met.
we talked.
he's fabulous.
Thank you so much.
Karen.
I love him.
Oh.
Jack.
It warms my heart to hear you say that.
Or maybe it's the gin rickey I just had in the limo.
Even on Skid Row I'm funny.
I have a really good feeling about this.
Karen.
He's playing it cool.
but um I think I might be gettin' some tonight.
What the hell are you talking about?
That man is your daddy.
Not yet.
No.
I mean he's your father.
What?
Yes.
I had Private Detective talk to your mom and he tracked down the guy in the Nixon mask.
John Marshall is your father.
Oh my God.
you found my dad!
Oh my God.
I hit on my dad.
- Ew!
- Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
I need soap.
I need a Handi Wipe for my brain.
Ughh!
Oh.
I hit on my father.
I'm Soon-Yi.
So.
Jack.
why don't we go someplace where we can be alone?
- Ew!
- Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
No.
you don't understand.
You're my daddy.
Not yet.
- Ew!
Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
No.
In 1968 you went to a pool party.
you had a Nixon mask on.
you had sex with my mother.
Wait a minute.
1968-- if we're talking about the same party.
there we a lot of guys in Nixon masks.
Well.
Dick was big that year.
And anyway.
I'm gay.
Me too.
That must be where I get it.
No.
No.
I mean I can't be your father because I don't have sex with women.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Not even once?
- Could you?
- Ew!
Ew!
- Ew!
Ew!
Thank you for coming.
Well.
you know.
since we.
um cleared the air.
- want to get a drink at Boy Bar?
- I'll get us a cab.
Wait a minute.
wait a minute!
Don't you find this just a little bit eepy-cray?
She is kinda right.
It is weird.
John.
You know-- - I have tickets to the Backstreet Boys.
- I'll call you later.
Karen.
This damn thing-- I-- I'm supposed to go on in a minute.
So.
four people have asked me where the newlyweds are registered.
I told them "International Male".
I have a feeling we're going to be getting a lot of mesh thongs.
Will.
I'm sorry.
it's just--  What happened?
Was it a misunderstanding - that got out of control?
- No.
Is it that you like Grace so much you wish we were married?
God.
no!
I mean-- I-- I like her and all that.
but no.
Then tell me.
because I know that you would never do something Iike this unless you had a very good reason.
What do you want me to tell you?
You want me to tell you that this company is run by a homophobic right-wing maniac?
ls that what you want to know?
I mean.
here I am coming up on my pension.
your grandmother insists on living year after year after year.
and that's not cheap.
If I lose this job.
who's gonna hire a guy my age.
Will?
Who?
Dad.
I had no idea.
Is that-- is that really true?
God.
I wish it was.
Yeah.
me too.
What is this?
Look.
it-- it's not me.
Will.
There's a lot of small-minded people out there.
I just can't stand the thought of somebody judging you.
- People making judgments - All right.
Dad.
Dad.
stop.
I got it.
It's the Captain Lenny thing all over again.
What?
You don't remember Captain Lenny?
He used to introduce the cartoons on Channel 4.
I was 10, you took me on that business trip to New York and there in the hotel bar was Captain Lenny.
drinking a beer and hitting on a waitress.
I was very upset and you said to me.
"Willy.
he's not really a captain.
He's just a guy".
Oh.
you're killing me here.
man.
You're my dad.
I love you.
You did what you thought you needed to do.
You're just a guy.
George.
you're on.
Finally.
What?
What?
Don't look at me like that.
The girls take too long.
Aren't you gonna wash your hands?
So here he is.
George Truman.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I guess.
Thank you.
wow.
Lifetime achievement award.
That's really an honor.
My son's gay.
Will.
where are you?
- He's here!
- Grace.
Hi.
son.
I-- I-- I told you all that.
uh I told you all that Will and Grace were married and they're not.
Will is Will is gay.
He's a proud gay man.
And I'm a proud father.
Of a proud gay man.
-  - Thank God that's over.
No.
no.
no.
I got a lot more to say.
Oh my God.
He comes into the living room.
Iooks us both right in the eye.
and he says.
"Mom.
Dad.
I'm gay.
And I want to bring my boyfriend home for Christmas".
And I said.
"You couldn't give me just a necktie.
Iike any other father"?
God.
even when he's bad.
he's good.
And then.
you know-- ah.
no.
I'm not even going to tell you about the time he did "Ben Hur" as a musical in the living room.
Changed the title to "Ben Him".
Will-- Will.
stand up.
Yeah.
yeah.
stand up.
Hey-- I want everyone to see you.
Come on.

Come on.
Will.
Come on.
Will.

I love my gay son.
everybody.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Pop.
- The wife is always the last to know.
- Oh.
stop.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Grace: But Josh is really great.
you know.
he's sweet.
he's kind.
he's very in tune with my body.
A little too fond of the gentle forehead kiss.
It's like being kissed by my grandmother.
except Josh doesn't have a moustache.
But still he's a solid B. B+.
What do they seal these things with.
high-grade epoxy?
Cookies should be easily accessible.
Hey.
we're talking about my cookies here.
I'm listening.
I-- just grab hold of that end.
will you?
Thank you.
I've been dying for a Milano since 63rd Street.
- I don't think so.
- Hey!
Jack!
Why eat them?
Why not just apply them directly to your man teats?
- Come on.
- Give him a break.
he's skinny.
Let him eat his cookies.
Hetero skinny is very different than homo skinny.
You're not in the club.
you wouldn't understand.
Don't--  Open these.
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- Josh and I are going to the movies.
Wrong.
Will?
- I was gonna go to the gym and-- - Wrong.
What is the matter with you people?
Will.
tonight you're making dinner and the three of us will be parked in front of your TV to watch our new favorite sitcom "Along Came You".
And why is it our new favorite sitcom?
Because tonight Ed and Gerard are going to kiss.
Only the first-ever primetime network kiss between two gay men.
- Ooh.
that's tonight?
- It's in "TV Guide".
Don't you read?
- "Great".
- I know, I'm excited too.
- No.
I meant watch out for the-- -  - Ooh.
- grate.
Hey.
first-ever kiss between a gay man and 88th Street.
- Not funny!
- Oh.
that was funny.
That was funny.
Come on.
Will.
hurry up.
you're gonna miss it.
Okay.
Woman on  You're sure you don't want tojoin me for lunch?
No they don't.
How come women never know when they're not wanted?
- If that remark was meant for me-- - Shh-hh!
You gonna talk through the whole show?
Man on  Wow, so it's just us.
- Man #2: Yeah, we're finally alone.
- Yep.
Just us.
Ed, don't move, you have an eyelash.
Oh.
please.
that's the oldest line in the book.
I've used it.
Me too.
He's moving in.
It's gonna happen.
Oh my God.
do you understand this is bigger than the moon landing?
One giant step for man on mankind.
Here it comes.
here it comes.
- Oh.
Iet's hold hands.
- Okay.
Man #1 : I think I'm about to kiss you.
Man #2: I think I'm about to be kissed.
Gay sex is so hot.
This is it.
this is it!
This is not it.
Where is the camera going?
Why are we looking at a fireplace?
Get off the flames and follow the flamers!
No.
come on.
they didn't show us anything.
- I can't believe this.
- Oh come on.
Jack.
what did you expect?
I expected a kiss.
I've been preparing for the kiss.
I was on a juice fast for 72 hours so I'd look good for the kiss.
This is a crime against humanity.
Jack.
two guys didn't kiss on a sitcom-- I don't think that warrants reconvening the Nuremberg jury.
Don't throw your knowledge of current events at me.
The network promised we were gonna see some guy-guy lip action.
For someone who has a gay porn collection that requires its own storage facility you seem pretty upset about one kiss.
Missing the point.
darling.
By doing this.
they're sending a clear message that the way I live my life is offensive.
Jack.
the way you live your life is offensive.
but they should have shown those guys kissing.
I had a really good time.
I'm glad we could meet for lunch.
Hey.
did you get the lumbar pillow I left with your doorman?
I did.
thank you.
That was so sweet of you.
It's filled with tea.
The lady at the nature store said it's very soothing.
particularly if you're cramping during menses.
I had a really nice time.
Don't say menses.
Bye.
You'll call me later?
I will.
Mmm.
He should be killed.
He happens to be the sweetest.
most thoughtful.
most sensitive guy I have ever gone out with.
I think he's great.
He makes me wanna barf.
I wanna kick him till he's dead.
honey.
Karen.
no.
I have just gotten off of a string of really bad boyfriends-- Adam.
whose closest thing to a compliment was.
"If you lost a little weight in the ass.
you'd look pretty good"; Alex.
who thought things could be improved by bringing another woman into the relationship; Stoner Jeff.
who loved his bong more than me.
I mean.
Josh is the first guy in a long time who treats me like a goddess.
Bye-bye.
Josh!
He is sensitive and caring.
Thank you for playing.
He truly loves and understands women.
Don't let the door hit Grace's big ass on your way out.
Hey.
valley of the dolls?
Josh is one in a million.
He's sweet and kind and attentive and he'll be gone by the weekend.
Yes.
I'd like to speak to the President of NBC.
please.
This is Jack McFarland.
How long will he be in the meeting?
Very fine.
I'll call back later.
Hi.
I'd like to speak to the President of NBC.
please.
It's Julianna Margulies.
I have a cold.
Hello?
Hello?
How do you stop unwanted homosexuals from invading your office?
Come on.
we're going down to the network to protest.
Chop chop.
You're still on that?
Wow!
I thought that will go away as quickly as your last big issue-- the underrepresentation of gay animals at the Bronx Zoo.
They brought in a family of fruit bats.
Coincidence?
I don't think so.
Let's go.
Jack.
I'm not going anywhere.
I have to work so you can eat.
- You're wasting your time.
- I am outraged by this.
- Why aren't you?
- Because I'm realistic.
Clearly.
nobody wants to see two men kissing on television-- not the network.
not the viewers.
not the advertisers-- That's right.
Will.
They want to pretend we're invisible.
What about our constitutional right to see two hotties get it on?
Will that be the constitution that begins-- "Whee.
the people"?
Jack.
you're fighting a losing battle.
Go to my place.
steal a sweater.
have a nice afternoon and leave the silly protest to Woody Harrelson and his hemp flip-flops.
Look.
Will.
I don't like to say this but I need you.
Sure I have the face and the bod.
hence the modeling career and the early years of dance.
What?
!
But you-- you're the dowdy bookish sister.
You're-- Will.
plain and tall.
I need you and your $10 words and your "be that as it mays" to help me make my case.
Really?
You can't just draw on your early years of dance?
When you and your boyfriend here are done with your little game of slap and tickle-- Mr. Doucette would like for you to call him in the car.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Whatever you say.
Will.
you coming or not?
Jack.
no.
I'm sorry I can't.
Just so you know-- we are no longer friends.
Yeah.
that's what you said last week at the movies when I left you the black Jujube.
Thanks a lot.
Will.
Thanks for recognizing when something is really important to me.
I thought you promised to wear a French maid's uniform the next time you did this.
Your place is filthy.
PS-- Iived here seven months.
you may wanna think about unpacking.
PS-- I thought we talked about the PS.
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to help out.
By the way.
you have milk in the refrigerator that's so bad it's now good cheese.
Where do you keep the scrubby stuff?
- What did you do to Jack?
- What?
Every time you're a bad friend to Jack.
you always become a better friend to me.
He wants me to go down to the network and complain about this whole kiss thing and I said no and he's mad at me.
How ridiculous is that?
Hmm.
Hmm?
What?
You think I'm wrong?
All I said was hmm.
Oh.
but there was so much behind that hmm.
Okay.
Look.
Jack has been focused on one issue for more than a day and a half.
This is big.
It may be ridiculous but it's important to him and he is your friend.
I mean.
to me that's reason enough to support him.
Talk about something else.
Ooh.
pushed a button.
Broken up with Josh yet?
- Can we talk about something else?
- Ooh.
- Pushed a button.
- I'll break up with him tonight.
okay?
Last night was really special.
Yeah.
it was.
Tsk.
do you really think that look scares me?
Hah!
I once walked in on Faye Dunaway with a wig cap.
I'm not leaving here until the president of the network hears what I have to say.
Please.
have a seat.
sir.
- You're very crafty.
aren't you?
-  Just so you know.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll chain myself to the desk if I have to.
He will.
He has his own chains.
Oh my God.
Will.
I knew you'd come!
I mean.
what are you doing here?
I'm here to help you.
Together.
you and I are gonna stick it to the man.
Good idea.
but let's do this first.
Karen?
It's Grace.
Grace Adler.
Honey.
how did you get this number?
!
You gave me this number in case of emergencies.
remember?
Oh yeah.
right.
right.
good.
Yeah.
I want you to have it.
Stanley.
have Butler change all the phone numbers on the second floor.
So what's going on.
honey?
I have to be mean and I need an expert.
Well.
I'm flattered.
What can I do you for?
Stan.
that had better be soap on a rope.
Um Karen.
I-- I can't get rid of this guy.
He's a sweetheart but he's just not for me and I just don't know how to say it to his face.
Well.
say it to his bald spot as you push him out of the cab.
Bye-bye.
No.
no.
no.
Wait.
wait.
I can't do it that way.
How do I explain this?
Most human beings are endowed with the capacity to feel emotion.
Well.
they're weak.
Come on.
help me.
I need a good lie.
Oh I know.
honey.
come on.
that's easy-- tell him you're madly in love with Will.
Of course.
I don't know where the lie part comes in but-- I think it will work.
You know what?
This was a mistake.
I'm sorry I even called you.
Goodbye.
Hey?
I'm going to pick you up some wild yam essence.
Thanks.
It helps with breast tenderness brought on by water retention.
Jack: And just as Ed and Gerard were about to kiss they cut away to the fireplace and I just find that reprehensible.
What's your complaint?
I want Carson back.
That's important too.
- Have you always been political?
- You're speaking a little too loudly.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
- No.
not you.
I spoke to one of their PR people.
He said they're sending someone down to talk to us.
Who is this?
- Will.
this is my new friend.
Crazy.
- Got you.
- Hey-o!
- Hi.
So.
to do the Kegel exercise.
you just clench and release.
It's really quite wonderful.
Like sit-ups for love's sweet flower.
Wow!
Almost brought up a little yam there.
Mmm.
siss-boom-bah!
"What do you hear when Scrooge passes a stone"?
That's very funny.
I've the creeping fear that she enjoys her life more than I do.
Because she has 250 people in her head.
- none of whom own a toothbrush.
- Hmm-mm.
Get this over to Roz Weiman's office.
Hi.
I'm Craig Fissay.
Executive Vice-President in charge of public relations for the office of the president of the network.
You're his assistant.
We spoke earlier?
Anyway.
I've been sent down here to respond to your complaint regarding the kiss on "Along Came You".
Yes.
we are outraged.
I hope you presented him with my letter and the petition?
- I did.
- What did he have to say?
Well.
it was discussed at length and the final word is "No comment".
Have a good day.
gentlemen.
and thank you for visiting us at NBC.
Ding-ding-dong.
Wait.
no.
whoa-- we are loyal viewers and consumers and we find your policies unfair and discriminatory.
What you need to understand-- No.
sir.
what you need to understand is that this network has a responsibility to its audience.
Now.
I understand your disappointment.
Believe me.
I understand.
- Hi.
- Hi.
But you will never see two gay men kissing on network television.
Uh-- it's a gay network for God's sake!
The symbol is a peacock.
Have a nice day.
Sally!
Come on in.
he'll see you now.
Okay.
Iet's go everybody.
I said now.
That was appalling.
It's a travesty of justice.
We need to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
We have friends there.
We'll talk to that gay justice.
You know that little fellow we like with the glasses.
We've been over this.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a woman.
I am not done with this.
We need to get our message out there.
put it on the national stage.
I know.
I'll write an epic poem and post it on my website What's an epic poem?
- It's long.
- Okay.
scratch that.
Okay.
thinking.
thinking.
thinking I know.
I'll use the news media.
I'll talk to AI Roker.
'Cause as everyone knows.
once you have an avuncular weatherman on your side.
there's no end to your power.
No.
he's right over there doing "The Today Show".
Al.
Al!
Al: All right!
I'm sorry.
Let's look and show you what's going on as far as your weather is concerned.
Mm-mm!
Big old.
handsome warm front coming in from the south.
Whoo!
Oh.
Stanley.
you know I don't find that funny.
Now get me another towel and put it on the real towel rack.
Um.
Josh.
I have something that I really need to tell you and I don't know how to say it other than to just come out with it.
Um.
I'm in love with another man.
You're-- It's Will.
You met him.
he lives across the hall.
Oh.
Jack: Al.
Al!
Will: Jack.
there's 1.000 people here.
he's not gonna talk to you.
Al.
it's my birthday.
I'm a 100 years old.
talk to me.
Hi.
what's your name?
Hi.
Oh my God.
AI Roker!
I don't know if you recognize me but my name is Jack McFarland.
I do a one-man show every Wednesday night at the duplex called "Just Jack".
Additional info on my website "Just Jack"?
What happened to Jill?
You guys have a fight?
"No.
it's my pail of water".
"No it's my pail of water".
Oh my God.
that's so funny.
Anyways.
the reason we're here-- I don't know if you're aware but on this week's episode of "Along Came You".
there was supposed to be a kiss and there wasn't.
You know.
Jack.
sometimes a kiss is just not a kiss.
- Do we have any anniversary here?
- Whoa.
whoa.
back to Jack.
We went to complain and this closet case upstairs-- cute in an offbeat way.
got his number-- totally gave us the brush-off and I want to know how long I have to wait until I can see two gay men kiss on network television?
Not as long as you'd think.
Oh my Lord!
Not your boyfriend.
my ass.
That's the love of my life-- kissing that guy.
Man.
that was incredible!
Four second before I did it.
I didn't know I was gonna do it and then-- I just did it.
Yes.
well.
brava.
I mean.
but let's be honest with each other.
We both know what actually happened this morning.
Remind us.
Masking your attraction to me with a political agenda.
I mean-- you are so transparent.
Wow!
Nothing gets by you.
I just pray none of my boyfriends saw that tragic display.
Because that's like five serious long-term relationships down the tube.
Five.
huh?
That's a lot of balls in the air.
I just-- I just can't believe we did it.
Yes.
well-- despite how creepy the motivation.
a lot of people out there owe us a big fat thank you.
Well.
thank you very much!
Because of your little on-air lip lock.
I'm gonna spend the next week in an ashram with no heat with my undumped boyfriend Josh.
I thought you were gonna break up with him.
I was.
until some big queen on "The Today Show" blew my alibi.
She's talking about you.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I don't know how these'll be.
I had to try a different deli.
I'm so bummed they closed down our old place.
I loved it there.
Stinking Board of Health.
Okay.
Grace-- what's going on with that necklace?
Josh gave it to me.
It's a Chinese serenity symbol.
It means earth and air united as one.
We have a similar symbol in my culture.
It's called "cheap little stone hanging on a string".
Don't give me the face.
It's cute.
We're glad you're seeing someone.
Kumbaya.
Good news.
Will.
Jackie!
- Benji.
- Hey.
Whoa.
whoa.
whoa.
Jack.
what are you doing?
Truman.
come on.
It's two men kissing.
Don't get so uptight.
It's not that.
It's just-- when did earth and airhead unite as one?
Chello.
do you think you're the only one who uses this office?
- Hey.
Grace.
- Hello.
Mr. Doucette.
Oooh.
ice.
ice.
baby.
Okay.
Ben.
I know we've had our differences in the past-- I decorated your place.
you didn't like it.
you're crazy.
you didn't want to pay.
I sued.
I won.
But who even remembers all that?
Who indeed?
What I'm saying is.
I am perfectly willing to put it all behind us if you will just give me a simple.
"I'm sorry".
That's all.
a little gesture.
So.
Will.
this is your lucky day.
I found someone I think you should go out with.
- He'll take him.
- Well-- uh-- No.
no.
I don't know.
Blind dates Now.
trust me.
He's perfect for you.
He'll take him.
Slow down there.
Trigger.
Look-- what makes him perfect?
- He's gay.
- He'll take him.
You're fixing me up with a guy just because both of us are gay?
As I said.
I'm past all this.
I'm just giving you the opportunity to clear your conscience.
Little.
tiny.
two words.
Here's his card.
He's an old poker buddy of mine.
Call him.
What?
You want to be celibate the rest of your life?
Thank you.
Ben.
it's not that I don't appreciate it.
It's just that it's a little weird.
You're my boss.
it makes me feel kind of obligated.
Good.
See you.
Jack.
Living you.
Ioving you.
Iiving you.
Grace.
always a pleasure.
Wow.
The man cannot let go of anything.
You know what?
No, I'm not gonna to do this.
Blind dates are a nightmare.
Always ends up being with some guy who keeps yapping on about his two cats.
while I spend the night figuring out how to get out of there by faking my own death.
Excuse me.
Mother Superior.
It just so happens that I've met many fine young lovelies on blind dates.
We're talking about blind dates.
not blindfolded dates.
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- Uh.
yeah.
Iet me have a martini.
Oh.
and look.
since you're gonna be our waiter.
um could you do me a favor?
Could you be extremely rude and rush us through our meal?
lnterrupt us and don't offer any desert.
- Blind date?
- Oh.
yeah.
No problem.
Excuse me.
um I don't mean to sound critical.
but I think your breadstick's a bit out of tune.
Well.
that makes sense because it's flatbread.
- I hope you're Will.
- I am Will.
I'm Charlie.
By the way.
I'm finding your Scottish brogue particularly appropriate for this venue.
Thanks a lot.
dude.
I love your accent too.
Thanks for walking me back to work.
Whoa.
Got skirt?
Oh.
I almost forgot.
- I have another gift for you.
- Oh.
Josh.
you don't have to-- I saw this rock on Ninth Avenue and it reminded me of you.
Beauty in an unlikely place.
Oh.
thanks.
It's-- It's.
um Josh.
I don't think it's a rock.
I think it's gum.
Speaking of things you scrape off your shoe.
get out of here!
So where do you want to have dinner tonight?
Wherever you want.
Okay.
but what are you in the mood for?
Grace.
I just want to be with you.
so it really doesn't matter.
Oh.
Josh.
Why doesn't this chair come with an air-sickness bag?
You know.
Karen.
there's a pressure point at the base of your neck.
I could work on it to help you release some of that anger.
Lay one paw on me and you'll be picking up two other rocks on Ninth Avenue.
Karen.
don't make me get the hose.
Josh.
I'll see you later.
- I wish it were later.
- I know you do.
Mmmm.
Oh.
you kissed my third eye.
Save it!
I know what you're gonna say.
"Oh.
he makes me sick.
I would barf.
but that would be a waste of perfectly good puke".
"Mah mah mah.
mah mah mah.
mah mah.
" Honey.
what is this?
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Look.
Josh may not be perfect.
but he happens to be a really.
really great guy.
Okay.
he could be stronger.
a little more decisive.
He could go five minutes without saying "I love you".
-  - Grace Adler-- Thanks.
Josh.
you too.
- But you can't change people.
so-- - No, see, that's where you're wrong.
Men are like dogs.
You can either neuter 'em or train 'em.
Now.
go.
go.
Move.
move.
moo-ve.
mooo-ve.
Now you tell me what it is you don't like about the talented Mr. Wimpley.
and I'll tell you how to change it.
Okay.
He takes pictures of me sleeping.
He thinks that's beautiful.
To me it's a little "The call is coming from inside the house".
Easy squeezy.
It's all about communication.
You want to just sit him down.
and you say.
"Honey.
you take one more picture like that and I'm not gonna have sex with you anymore".
Huh?
Yeah?
How about that?
Withhold sex?
That's your technique?
No.
That's ridiculous.
Oh.
and please tell me that's not how you train your dog.
All right.
all right.
fine.
Different approach.
Give me another example.
Come on.
Every time we go out to dinner.
I'm the one who picks the restaurant.
How come he can't make a decision?
Simple pimple.
Again.
it's communication.
You sit him down and you say.
"Josh.
if you don't pick a restaurant.
I'm not gonna have sex with you anymore".
I can't say that.
- Of course you can.
Say it.
- No.
- I'm not gonna have sex with you.
- No.
I'm not gonna have sex with you.
I am not going to have sex with you.
I am not going to have sex with you.
I'll have sex with you.
Mr. Doucette called from the car.
He wanted you to know - that he's half an hour away.
- Okay.
- That was about 28 minutes ago.
- Truman-- Thanks for the heads up.
Nice work closing the Kinnally deal.
I thank you and my house in the Hamptons thanks you.
Oh.
and I want to play racquetball with you at 6:00.
Well.
I should warn you.
Ben.
I'm a pretty serious racquetball player.
I never lose.
Until today.
- Good man.
- Oh.
uh.
by the way.
Ben.
just curious.
you didn't happen to hear from Charlie.
did you?
- Yeah.
I talked to him this morning.
- Oh.
Thought he might be out of town 'cause it's been three days since we had dinner and I hadn't heard from him.
Three days?
Wow.
Guess I misjudged you.
Whoa.
whoa.
What does-- what does that mean?
I just thought it would work between you two.
It didn't.
But you said you misjudged me.
Will.
I don't know how it works in a gay relationship.
but let me tell you how it works with me.
Say I go out with a woman.
right away you know she's attractive.
but I mean stunning.
She's having a fantastic time.
Why wouldn't she?
Look at me.
Does it hurt your back to kiss your own ass like that?
You get one of those a year.
Will.
Now.
great date for her.
so-so date for me.
So at this point I do a cost-benefit analysis.
Is the cost of pursuing this relationship worth the benefits - I will accrue from furthering it?
- What exactly are you saying?
You're a lousy date.
Will.
Later.
Wait.
whoa!
I am not a lousy date.
I happen to be a killer date.
I have a great sense of humor.
I'm a lot of fun.
I make a decent income-- could be better.
we'll talk-- and I've been told by more than one man that I am.
uh well.
hot.
- Did he call you?
- Did he-- What-- - No.
- Will.
I understand.
I just knocked the wind out of your sails.
You can barely make it through the day.
- And?
- And see you on the courts at 6:00.
And I must warn you.
I'm very limber.
I can kiss my own ass.
Coffee?
So I tried your technique last night.
So tell me already before I lose my morning buzz.
Okay.
we had a perfectly nice dinner at a Chinese restaurant.
I chose.
Josh then presented me with a beautiful leaf - he found in Central Park.
- Puke.
I know.
We ended up at a video store.
Josh.
what do you want to see?
I don't care.
sweetie.
as long as I'm in bed watching it with you.
I'm happy.
- Barf.
- I know.
Cut to: we are back at the apartment making out.
clothes are coming off.
he's getting excited-- Come on!
Puke and barf.
Skip to when you put the lid on the honey pot.
So I pull away.
He says.
"What"?
And then we get into the whole thing.
the new ageyness.
the indecisiveness.
the leaves.
the rocks.
I didn't want to say it.
but before I knew it the words were coming out of my mouth.
"Josh.
things have to change or I'm not having sex with you".
- Ahhh!
You didn't!
- I did.
- Was he shocked?
- He was floored.
- I am good.
- Yes.
you are.
- So what did he say?
- He dumped me.
- I need to talk.
Good.
- I need to talk.
Good.
- What are you doing?
- We always go to your apartment.
Because your apartment smells like asparagus and shoes.
Right behind ya.
Before we get into this let's be clear.
all I want is for you to listen and tell me I'm right.
- That's all I want from you.
Go.
- Good.
It's been three days.
Charlie hasn't called.
Now Ben says it's because I'm a lousy date.
Ha ha ha ha.
I'm laughing.
Me?
A lousy date?
I think he's a lousy date for not calling me.
right?
Sure.
Okay.
my turn.
Okay.
Josh is a great guy.
I really like him.
but things about him could be improved.
I tried to improve them by withholding sex.
and what does he do?
He dumps me.
- He's a fool.
right?
- Yeah.
Me.
now.
I mean guys always call me back the next day.
Why?
Because I got it going on.
right?
It's so on.
I had every right to do what I did.
As far as I'm concerned.
it's his loss.
- Yeah.
- We're fine.
- We're great.
- They're messed up.
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel better.
- Me too.
- Ah!
Why didn't Charlie call?
I'm a bad date.
Withholding sex.
I'm a freakin' idiot!
Welcome to the Jack McFarland date clinic.
Let's go to zero.
And the date begins - now.
Hi.
- Hi.
Okay.
Iet's stop right there.
First of all.
why would you choose to wear your fat jeans on a blind date?
These are not my-- I don't have fat jeans because I'm not fat!
How did I ever think this was a good idea?
Because I'm an expert.
Will.
I go on literally thousands of dates a year.
That doesn't make you an expert.
that makes you an escort.
Any particular reason we had to come back here?
Hello?
Scene of the crime.
We have to retrace your steps to find out where exactly you went wrong.
Now.
Iet's start again.
- Hi.
I'm Jack McFarland.
- I'm Will Truman.
- Okay.
stop.
- Come on!
What did I do wrong?
I just said my name.
It doesn't work.
Will Truman.
it's not-- it's a turnoff.
Um what about Mary Fat Jeans?
- Bye bye.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
sorry.
Just giving you a little rough love.
Look.
I know you're in the dark.
Iady.
But the truth is you're a bit of a catch.
Any guy would kill to be standing - where I'm standing right now.
- Thanks.
Jack.
You will now forget everything I've just said.
You didn't hypnotize me.
you monkey.
Didn't l?
Now.
back to zero.
Your date is now becoming very bored with you.
you can't afford to be coy.
Why not show some interest by touching me gently yet inappropriately?
There you go.
very good.
Ow!
- What was that?
- Okay.
Iet's-- Iet's go back to zero.
Answer it!
Hello?
l-- Honey.
you scared me.
what's the name of the company again?
Grace Adler Designs.
Grace Adler Designs?
Oh.
hi.
Pharmacist.
No.
honey.
I don't need anything for the weekend unless the FDA's approved something new.
Oh.
terrif.
send me a bottle.
Yeah.
actually.
make it two.
Yeah.
we're taking family portraits this weekend.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Send my best to Lorraine and the kids.
Kisses.
If you're finished violating federal law.
do you think you could bring me those sketches I asked for two weeks ago?
Honey.
don't start with that or I'm gonna go after those pants.
Listen.
I know you're still mad at me about what happened with Josh.
but when you think about it.
really.
honey.
shouldn't you be mad at yourself for taking advice from somebody who was probably half in the bag at the time?
So really I shouldn't be listening to you now?
Probably not.
Oh.
I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best.
I mean I really like Josh.
but but maybe he's not what I need.
I mean.
I need a guy who has has more of an edge.
who's a little tougher.
And clearly that's not him.
- I want to talk to you.
- Josh.
I was just talking-- You're not talking right now.
I'm talking.
I went home the other night very upset.
I couldn't even meditate.
I'm thinking.
why is Grace acting like this?
She's not manipulative.
she's not callous.
Where the hell did she get this behavior?
And then it hit me-- she got it from you.
You.
A woman who thinks an act of kindness is letting her stepkid have the fruit out of her whiskey sour.
You know.
there's only one thing worse than advising someone to use sex as a bargaining chip.
and that's taking that advice.
Maybe I have taken one too many stress management courses.
okay?
Okay?
Maybe I should lower my dosage of St. John's wort.
whatever.
But I like myself and I'm not gonna change for anyone.
I would gladly work out problems with you.
but if you want to continue in this relationship.
you take me as I am.
- Oh.
Josh!
- Back off.
Whoa.
whoa.
whoa.
slow down there.
cowboy.
A gentleman always eats like a lady.
Okay?
And this is probably a good time to compliment your date.
Tell me my eyes are pretty.
- The bug eye or the other one?
- Okay.
See.
this arrogance is why your date with Charlie didn't work out.
- I am not arrogant.
- Yes.
you are.
You've been acting superior to me all evening.
That is not arrogance.
that's scientific fact.
Besides.
we had a great date.
We laughed he should have called me.
You see?
There it is again.
And what's behind that arrogance?
A layer of fat then fear.
Fear rolled in fat.
wrapped in arrogance.
I am not arrogant and I am not afraid.
Then why don't you call him?
Could it be fear of rejection?
Of starting over?
Of opening yourself up to someone else?
What?
I think you may have a point.
For real?
- Wow.
- In spite of your trying to help.
Jack.
you've actually helped.
- I appreciate how much you care-- - Shut up!
I totally made out with that bartender.
Uh hi.
Charlie.
it's Truman.
Will Truman.
And I really didn't mean to say that in a "Bond.
James Bond" kind of way.
Um I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.
- but you're here.
- Hello.
So call me when you get home.
Uh hi.
what are you doing here?
It's the only place in town that serves gray meat.
It reminds me of home.
What do you mean.
you don't remember me?
The glitter on my face.
the Barbarella costume?
- Mr. Doucette wants to see you.
- When?
- Truman?
- Now.
So.
word on the street is you're not such a bad second date.
Yeah.
I guess I just need to work on my first date skills.
- Were we supposed to play today?
- No.
I found another partner.
Someone who's not gonna show me up on the court.
- What are you talking about?
I lost.
- Not by enough.
Come on.
Ben.
Let's skidooch.
I'm on a schezule.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ugh.
will you let it go.
already?
I'm sorry.
but your husband here put a shameless move on the produce guy when I had subtly signaled to him that he was to be my hothouse tomato.
Subtly?
You-- you put the vegetable hose between your legs and shpritzed me.
Hey.
guys.
guys.
guys.
guys.
I can end this right now.
Although the produce man handles fruit.
he does not sleep with it.
He gave me his phone number.
- He was fat.
- Thing on his lip.
Answering machine: You have one message.
-  - Hey, Michael again.
Listen, I've been thinking and I'm gonna give you one chance to reconsider.
Come on, Face.
Call me.
I-- Oh my G--.
Why is my ex-boyfriend calling you?
Will.
you stay out of this.
Why is his ex-boyfriend calling you?
The man who dumped him after seven years and left him with nothing but a broken heart and a couple of love handles?
Michael called the other day.
He's back in Manhattan.
He just moved into a new townhouse and he asked me to decorate it.
How could you even think-- Will.
try and stay calm.
Breathe.
Here.
put your head between my knees.
Pass.
Uh-- Will.
I said no.
I thought it might be kind of weird for you.
"Thought".
"might".
"kind of"?
How could you?
Don't Will's feelings mean anything to you?
Look.
at least.
I'm here for you.
buddy.
You can always count on me.
even to--  Oh.
I gotta go.
Toby found a car.
Look.
I d-- I didn't tell you that he called.
because the last thing I wanted to do was to put you - in an uncomfortable position.
- Grace!
You should do this.
You were Michael's friend.
too.
You hung out together.
you were Buddhists for a week together.
I mean.
you gave him mono in a manner I'm still not entirely clear on.
It's fine.
I don't buy it.
You're a well-known liar.
You seem to have it in your head that this is a bigger deal for me than it is.
It's been two years.
I'm over him.
Do it.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
Anyway.
I know you want the job.
- You're already doing it in your head.
- I'm not.
- Living room?
- Ethnic texture.
- Bathroom?
- Plaid.
fun.
humor.
- Bedroom?
- Plush.
white.
the '40s.
- But you haven't thought of it?
- Hasn't even crossed my mind.
- Morning.
- Afternoon.
Honey.
I went out for drinks last night with the girls.
It was just me.
Paloma.
Marlo and Mr. Blackwell.
They're all doing something.
I mean.
take Marlo.
She's always working for charity.
she's on the board of.
uh-- Oh.
what the hell.
she's thin and busy.
Just made me think.
I mean.
I'm 32 years old and what have I done with my life?
Well.
for one thing.
you misplaced the better part of a decade.
So.
I've come to a decision.
I'm going to decorate Michael's place.
I mean.
he's gay.
how hard could it be?
Chrome.
black leather.
a shower for six.
done!
Um.
Karen.
okay.
You know what?
I really think that you are just stretched too thin as it is.
I mean.
you have nails to file.
Vogues to read.
and those pills aren't gonna take themselves.
Well.
that's very sweet of you.
honey.
but I really think that-- Karen.
I'm sorry.
No.
Oh.
I understand.
And you're right.
I guess I really haven't earned this opportunity.
Thank you.
It's yesterday's.
It's cold.
And there's Kahlua in it.
But thank you.
- I could make a fresh pot.
- You don't know how.
I could fax something.
You don't know how.
- I could-- - You don't know how.
Honey.
I love this blouse.
This fabric is just yummy.
- You are a pretty lady.
I don't tell-- - Okay.
okay.
okay!
Okay.
now you're creeping me out.
Okay.
you can-- you can do a chair.
- One.
one.
one chair.
- Oh.
thank you!
Oh.
you won't be sorry.
Michael is gonna be so happy.
That queen will be sitting on a throne.
Come on!
Come on.
come on.
come on.
I don't understand why you didn't just go in the movie theater.
I can't pee in public bathrooms.
Why not?
You do everything else in them.
Block.
Come on.
come on.
come on.
come on.
- You look like you're in pain.
- I am.
That's why I probably shouldn't do this.
Oh.
Grace.
one thing.
I want the powder room to be kind of butch.
Well.
Iet's start with not calling it the powder room.
Michael.
- I used to live there.
- I used to live there too.
That's right.
Was he a clean freak with you.
too?
Did he follow you around with a Dust Buster whenever you ate a muffin?
You were allowed to eat in the apartment?
He must have liked you more than a friend.
Oh.
okay.
all right.
here.
Uh.
I'll be right back.
I forgot my vitamin E stick.
I've been having such dry lip issues.
But we have all day to talk about that.
Goody.
- Michael.
- Will.
Oh.
my G--!
Oh my God.
Wow.
- How are you?
- Good.
You?
Good.
I-- I haven't seen you.
when-- when was it?
Oh.
it was the um-- - Yeah.
I know.
I know.
it's been-- - Yeah.
it's been s--  Yeah!
Okay.
We-- oh.
Yes.
Gay-ja vu.
Uh.
I thought that you and Jack were going to a movie.
Yeah.
we did.
but Jack had a large Sprite.
and.
well.
I promised him a gold star if we had a dry week.
you know.
Ah.
Okay.
Well.
you know.
we should really go.
because that way we won't be here.
So we-- - Hey.
Will?
- Hmm?
You look really good.
Damn.
my tiny bladder.
I can't believe I missed what happened out there.
Tell me everything.
Start from the beginning.
How did he say I looked?
Like you'd put on a little ego.
Can I just tell you.
I could swear I just got a vibe from Michael.
Iike he still feels something?
- Really?
- Well.
I mean.
come on.
Yes.
he's working with Grace.
but do they have to meet two feet from the apartment we shared for seven years?
Do they have to go to the restaurant where we had our first date?
Did he really say nothing about me?
He told me I looked good.
Your boyfriend's back.
he's gonna save your reputation Both: Hey la.
hey la.
Will: You know what I think?
I think he realized he made a mistake.
So?
How does it feel?
- Good.
felt good.
- Yeah?
- Don't tell me.
tell him.
- Really?
- I dunno.
I dunno-- - Look.
Iook.
Will.
if what's holding you back is your attraction to me.
I I just want you to know.
it will never happen.
Okay?
Let that free you to pursue other.
Iesser men.
Oh.
Jack.
there are no lesser men than you.
Thank you.
Karen Walker Designs.
Oh.
hey Grace.
Yeah Oh.
yeah.
it's just been ringing off the hook all morning.
No.
of course.
I haven't answered it.
I'm too busy working on my chair.
Oh.
yeah.
Good point.
Why did I pick it up now?
Hah!
She's crazy.
- Will!
- Hey.
Can l come in?
Well.
the place is a bit of a mess.
Still moving things in.
but yeah.
Yeah-yeah.
sure.
- Very nice.
- Thanks.
And it looks huge.
What do you need all this space for?
Well.
I'm thinking of getting a chimp.
You know how they like to cycle around the place.
I've got my chimp on a Nordic Trak.
He gets in his little suit and hops on.
watches the TV.
He loves it.
But enough about Jack.
- So.
why are you-- - I didn't get a chance to tell you.
when I saw you in the hallway of awkwardness that you look good.
too.
Thanks.
Listen.
I've been meaning to call you.
- It's been a while since we talked-- - Oh.
wow.
The first thing we ever bought together.
Unless you count the matching l-Can't-Even-Think-Straight T-shirts.
Look at it.
here it is.
right in the middle of the room.
Oh.
the second hand is still broken.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been meaning to get that fixed.
- Listen.
you want to go for a walk?
- Mickey.
Iook Iet me say this first.
You're back in town.
you're-- you're spending all this time with Grace.
You're hanging around the old apartment.
Now the clock.
I think we both know Look out.
ill-advised impulse purchase coming through.
Where do you want it?
- Bedroom.
- Right.
New York movers for you.
they move it and they judge it.
- Will-- - Let me finish.
It just seems like you may still have feelings for me.
and I want you to know that that I also-- Do you need to be here for this?
Uh.
yeah.
I do.
Will.
this is Andrew Kirkland.
We live together.
Huh.
Wow.
First they move you in.
then they stay.
- Will.
he's my-- - I-- I know who he is.
Michael.
- Andrew.
nice to meet you.
- Yeah.
I'm-- I'm gonna be going.
And I'm going to take this with me.
Karen: Oh, Grace.
Thank God you're here.
My head is spinning and not in a good way.
Okay.
okay.
Karen.
Calm down.
calm down.
All right.
Iet's try a little experiment we did during my first year at the Fashion lnstitute.
Okay.
One kiss and then back to work.
No.
A different experiment.
Okay sit in this chair and pretend you're at home.
Honey.
I can't do that.
My furniture's good.
- This is your third Manhattan.
- I'm in the library.
- Music is playing.
- Good.
Now.
you are unwinding after a nice dinner of cocktail onions and lime wedges.
- Mmm.
- What are you doing?
Probably yelling at the fat one.
Okay.
Yelling at the fat one-- known to his future therapist as Mason.
Go.
Okay.
"Hey.
Iittle Buddha!
Where you going with those pies"?
!
That didn't feel quite right.
- Try another one.
- Oh.
Okay.
"Mason.
sweetie.
would you like a glass of milk with that pie"?
What the hell?
!
Okay.
we're gonna keep this one for your desk.
- Next.
- Oh.
"Drop those pies.
boy.
You know the rule when we can see your neck.
you can have dessert".
"Rosario.
hug the girl.
The school said she needs affection".
"Oh.
and Stanley.
for God's sake.
get out of that tanning booth.
you're starting to look like a cheese doodle".
Oh.
this is a good one.
yeah.
Oh.
yeah.
Does your jaw unhinge when you capture prey?
How could you not tell me Michael has a boyfriend?
Oh my God.
what happened?
Did you guys talk?
Yeah.
yeah.
At his apartment.
When I went over and humiliated myself.
by telling Michael I still had feelings for him.
Wait.
What?
!
I thought you said you were over him.
Well.
excuse me for lying!
Hey.
hey!
Hey.
hey.
hey!
This is a place of business!
We are trying to get some work done in here.
and we don't need you just barging-- okay.
I'm saying it and I don't even buy it.
Okay.
creative urge filled.
but my urge for a gin rickey is still alive and kicking.
Okay.
I'm out of here.
Keep on yelling.
There you go.
How could you not tell me something like that?
I was trying to protect you.
Oh!
Nice.
nice job of protection.
Grace.
If you were a condom.
I'd be pregnant now.
I thought I was being a good friend.
Believe me.
the last thing I ever wanted was for you to get hurt.
Oh.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I just-- I-- I was out of my mind over there.
You know.
I took a clock!
Who does that?
- The deco clock in the living room?
- Yeah.
Oh thank God.
it was hideous.
It didn't go with anything I was doing.
- Grace!
- Oh!
Oh.
right.
Right.
right.
right.
Your pain.
How can I make it better?
Just-- I just need you to tell me everything.
It's much easier than finding out from other people.
Look.
I don't know.
You're gonna get upset.
- No.
I won't.
- You promise?
- I promise.
- Okay.
what do you want to know?
- When did they start going out?
- Oh.
you're gonna get mad.
- No.
I won't.
Tell me.
- January.
- Oh.
okay.
see?
Perfectly calm.
- Of '97.
What?
!
Two months after we broke up?
Damn it.
Grace!
Why don't you just stick a knife in my heart?
- But you said-- - Don't listen to me.
- you know better than that.
- See?
I was right!
I knew you were gonna get mad!
God.
I went over there.
I was wearing the good jeans.
I-- I-- I plucked my eyebrows so I wouldn't have that scary Peter Gallagher thing going on.
I'm an idiot!
- Sweetie.
no-- - No.
don't.
I can't believe you did this to me.
Hey.
Iittle camper.
How're you doing?
Fantastic.
Look.
Will.
you need to find some way to put this behind you.
People get over people.
I've had to get over a lot of people.
- It's hard.
- Jack.
I had a seven-year relationship.
You had a restraining order from the US gymnastic team.
Okay.
suggestion.
Get off your Huffy bike and let me help you.
You have to get past this Michael thing.
And I think I have just the answer.
Hi.
Jack.
why is there a sailor at my door?
Because this sailor is your new boyfriend.
You may now thank me.
Oh.
there's a lot of things I'd like to do to you right now.
I just need a yes or a no.
Anchors aweigh.
Vamos.
Jack: I think he's gonna be okay.
You want to hear something disturbing?
That's the same guy Jack brought me when I broke up with Danny.
Perhaps you've forgotten.
but I'm not talking to you.
Okay.
Will.
what did you expect Michael to do?
Pine away in a dark room.
while listening to "I Can't Live if Living is Without You"?
No.
There can be a lamp in the room.
What is it?
I just-- I can't-- I keep thinking I'm over this guy.
and then it turns out I'm not and I get pain.
Obviously, the same pathology that keeps me going back to see Kevin Costner movies.
Sweetie.
you invested seven years with Michael.
Of course it's gonna take some time.
Yeah.
so how come he finds somebody after two months?
Am I that easy to get over?
No.
No.
you're not.
Well.
how do you know?
- You wouldn't even-- - Will.
I know.
Oh.
that's right.
- You do know.
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
it was at college.
Okay.
when you and I broke up.
it was for different reasons.
I wanted to raise the kids Jewish.
you wanted to sleep with men.
I really do enjoy that.
Mmm.
The point being.
if I never got past that.
we wouldn't have this.
This this totally inappropriate.
boundariless.
highly-dysfunctional relationship that I cherish oh-so-much.
Thanks.
sweetie.
And I know that you're feeling badly right now.
but believe me.
this too shall pass.
I guess.
I just with I could-- could say the same about this cake.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
So.
when's your new lover supposed to get here?
He's not my lover.
It's just a date.
And did you meet lover at lover's lane?
Or did you two make a love connection at the love store while shopping for love lettuce?
I forgot to tell you that your mother phoned and left a message.
I've told you.
he's not my lover.
all right?
It's just-- I'm doing a favor.
He's-- he's my mother's dentist's bridge partner's son.
which I guess technically makes me a loser.
Wait a minute yup.
I got the same thing.
I met him once a long time ago.
and if memory serves.
he thinks he's God's gift to gay men.
and if that's true.
then God shops at the Newark airport.
So.
where are we taking loverboy?
Mickey D's.
Chuck E. Cheese.
KFC?
Hopefully.
nowhere.
See.
Grace and I have a plan.
She's gonna call me with some big emergency.
and that way I have an out.
It's so nice Grace does these things for you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Lucky.
Someday.
I hope to have a hag of my very own.
That's him.
How do I look?
I'm turned off and repulsed.
Bonus!
Hey.
sexy!
Hi.
Neil.
Ready to get Neiled?
Hey.
um.
you may want to stretch.
I know it's been a long time since you've been Neiled.
Later.
Iovers.
- So.
can I get you a drink?
- Whoa, slow down.
We'll get there.
brown eyes.
You're closer than you think.
-  - Oh.
thank God.
Excuse me.
Grace.
hi.
What's up?
I'm at Mount Sinai Hospital with Karen.
Stan's had a heart attack.
Mount Sinai.
Oh my gosh.
that's terrible.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Perfect.
A friend of mine just had a heart attack.
so I think we're gonna have to do this another night.
Aw Neil sad.
- Hello?
- Will.
I'm not joking here.
- Stan really is in the ICU.
- Hang on.
I'm on my way.
Listen!
Say something hospital.
Uh.
myocardial infarction.
uh.
Iime jello.
and "That gown goes on the other way".
I'll be right there.
Look.
I've got to go.
This-- this friend of mine really is in the ICU.
And later.
Will.
I see you?
Oh.
gee.
no.
Ugh.
this is always the worst part about hospitals.
the waiting.
Well.
that and needles.
Oh.
I don't like needles-- don't like looking at them.
don't like hearing about them.
You know.
I can't even say the name "Ringo" because he was a Beatle and that sounds like "needle".
Hey.
hey.
how's Stan?
What's go-- going on?
We don't know.
Karen's been in with the doctors for the last hour.
So.
what happened?
- She murdered Mr. Stan.
- I did not!
I was redecorating his study.
and Stan comes in and asks me if he could help.
so I say.
"Sure.
would you mind moving the ottoman"?
He does.
The next thing I know.
he collapses on the floor.
-  - You lie.
You should be in jail.
- Liar.
- Ringo.
Gay ferrets to the waiting area.
gay ferrets to the waiting area.
How is he?
What's going on?
What time did you guys get here?
- Why is no one talking?
- Would you calm down?
Don't tell me to calm down.
Stan Walker is like a father to me.
If anything ever happened to him.
I-- I don't know what l-- Man.
there are some really hot doctors in here.
Hey!
We don't have much news yet.
Stan's in the intensive care-- through no fault of mine.
Needle.
Well.
what about Karen?
I mean.
does anybody know how she's doing?
I'm sure she's fine.
If anybody can deal with this.
it's Karen.
Where are my husband's pills?
It's been two hours since I asked for them.
Now.
you give me Stan's pills at once!
I want those pills!
Give me my husband's pills!
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Walker.
there you go.
Thank you.
Look.
why don't you guys go on and go home?
I can take it from here.
Okay.
thanks for driving down.
What?
Well.
we all know who Karen's going to lean on for emotional support.
The same person she's always leaned on.
her poodle.
No offense.
chica.
but take your "cabeza" out of your "tuchus".
If Miss Karen falls apart.
you all know who she's gonna come to to pick up the pieces.
Um.
I don't think she'll be coming to anyone who wears a Members Only jacket.
I'm telling you.
it's going to be me.
You're the last person she'd go to.
Well.
next to Will.
Uh.
excuse me.
I am her lawyer.
and let's not forget.
she came to me when she was having trouble with her marriage.
She came to me when she needed to do her will.
she even came to me about a drinking problem.
- You're kidding.
- Well.
she was out of gin.
but the-- the point is.
she came to me then and she will come to me now.
- You think so?
- Yes.
I do.
Care to make it interesting?
Mrs. Walker.
I have some news about your husband.
Give it to me straight.
Doc.
Am I looking at a future filled with loneliness and memories of better days.
or is Stan gonna die?
Mrs. Walker.
the test results came back.
and it seems your husband didn't have a heart attack at all.
- Oh.
thank God.
- But rather acute angina.
You've got a lot of nerve coming on to me while my husband is dying.
Uh.
no.
no.
Mrs. Walker.
Angina.
it-- you know.
he's gonna be fine.
Which is good news for us.
but I'm not entirely sure how your friends are gonna react.
What are you talking about.
Dr. Huxtable?
They're taking bets to see which one you're gonna break down to first.
Those pigs are making bets on when I'm gonna turn on the waterworks?
Would you like me to tell your friends the news?
Let's wait on that for a little bit.
I've got a better idea.
Okay.
so.
just so we're clear.
The breakdown must include tears of emotional pain only.
No pulling hair.
no punching.
And.
of course.
no tiny pinches.
Wait a minute.
you guys.
are we being gross?
No.
we're not being gross.
Besides.
it's either this or 15 hours of reading Highlights magazine.
Really.
how many times can you find a toaster in a tree?
Come on.
are you in or you out?
I mean.
we know you're out.
but are you in?
- Can I borrow 100?
- Sure.
I'm in for 50.
- Grace.
you in?
- Yes.
I'm in.
I'm in shock is what I'm in.
You could bet less.
No!
How about a little compassion?
How about a little selflessness?
- Grace.
can I see you for a minute?
- I'm in.
I can't believe this.
I was sure it was gonna be me.
I was having fun at the hospital.
Now my whole evening is ruined.
Hey.
cheeks.
And now the fun is back.
Hi.
Karen.
Look.
I just wanted you to know that if-- oh my God!
Oh my God.
what is-- what is that on the table.
what is that?
Is that a needle?
ls that somebody's needle just out there in the open?
It's a chopstick.
you loon.
It came with my lunch.
Oh.
Anyway.
um.
I just-- I just wanted you to know that-- that if you need to talk.
or share anything.
I'm here for you.
Grace.
we've been working together for.
what.
11 years?
- 18 months.
- Seems longer.
And you know me better than anyone.
so.
naturally.
I want to open up to you.
but l-- Karen.
what-- what is it?
What do you need?
It's Stan.
He needs blood for a bypass.
and he needs it drawn slowly by a large.
pointy needle.
I-- I doubt that-- that I would even match.
I've-- I've got a-- a very rare blood type.
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- What type do they need?
What type do you have?
- What type do they need?
- What type do you have?
- AB negative.
- That's the type they need.
Jack: What'd I miss?
- Stan needs a bypass.
-  Grace is donating blood.
I don't know how she's gonna do it.
- I forgot.
she's terrified of needles.
- Poor girl.
- Yeah.
- So.
is the bet still on?
- Oh.
yeah.
come on.
- Yeah.
you got it.
- Hi.
everybody.
- All: Hey!
We don't really know anything yet.
They're running some tests.
but the doctors feel-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I need talk to Ja-- Will-- Rosario.
where is my Rosie?
I'm here.
- You want to talk with me about it?
- Yes.
Yes.
I do.
Rosie.
I'm just so worried about Stan.
I-- no.
I can't.
I-- - Come on!
Let it out!
- Okay-- ow!
Did you just pinch me?
I just feel like I have so much emotion just bottled up inside of me.
and if I don't let it out.
I'll just-- I'll-- no.
it's too filthy in here.
I can't.
- What?
- Well.
this place.
it's so dirty.
I mean.
the stench of Medicaid and thermometer lubricant.
You want me to clean the hospital?
Well.
just as much as you can get done.
And while you're at it.
why don't you take a look around and see what a real hospital corner looks like.
okay?
Now.
shift it!
Okay.
Miss Adler.
This is Nurse Trainee Pittman.
She'll be taking your blood.
I like your hair.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Her?
Is-- isn't there someone else who is a little more experienced?
Someone who didn't drive in on a Big Wheel?
Oh.
I don't drive.
I keep taking the test over and over again.
but I'm all.
"This is hard".
Now.
I don't want you to worry.
'cause Nurse Pittman is one of our finest trainees.
and I'm gonna be here with you the whole time.
Sweet.
my new Jag's here.
Don't worry.
ma'am.
I've done this bunches of times.
Mostly on oranges.
but Okay.
I have-- I have a little problem with that.
because.
you see.
I'm not an orange!
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
Honey.
I can't tell you what this means to me.
- Oh.
poodle.
- Oh.
Karen.
what's the matter?
Jack.
I'm so worried.
I keep thinking about Stan.
Oh.
I know.
I know.
I keep thinking about him too.
Was that a tear?
Did I win?
I mean.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Honey.
if Stan goes.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to give up a lot of the luxuries that we've come to enjoy.
Hey.
Iady.
as long as we've got each other.
- Oh.
- I don't care about that other stuff.
No.
What luxuries.
exactly?
Now.
you may want to have a donut and some juice first.
First?
lsn't it supposed to be after?
Wait!
After?
After?
Dumb.
dumb.
dummy!
What are you-- what are you doing?
Karen's making me cut up my credit cards.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
Visa.
You were everywhere I wanted to be.
Diner's Club.
didn't really know what you were good for.
but I'll still miss you just the same.
And Amex Platinum.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
- Need a tissue.
buddy?
- I'm okay.
Maybe I should get Karen one.
'cause when you were talking to her.
you really opened her up emo-- oh.
no.
actually that was you blubbering like a little girl.
I'm sorry.
You see.
this is why she hasn't come to you.
"Hello.
my name is Will.
I have no human emotions.
I am made of only metal.
wires and fat".
Bloogy-bloogy-bloogy-bloogy.
For your information.
my job is dealing with people in crisis.
and I'm particularly good at it.
Why?
Because I have a sixth sense about when people are in trouble.
And yet she still hasn't come to you.
Hmm.
interesting.
Why do you think that is.
Arrogancia?
Will.
can I see you in here for a minute?
Go with that.
I think you're really onto something.
Karen.
did you-- did you want to see me?
Honey.
I-- I know we haven't gotten along very well in the past.
- And?
- That's it.
Your turn.
Look.
I-- - You must be exhausted.
but-- - Yeah.
I just want you to know that I'm not just a lawyer.
I'm-- I'm a human being.
you know.
with a-- with an ear and a shoulder.
And a heart as big as all get-out.
- Hey.
cowboy.
- Get out!
You know.
take a hint.
I don't dig you.
okay?
Okay.
okay.
you don't have to tell Neil twice.
Apparently.
you do.
Get out!
I'm sor-- where were we?
Honey.
who was that?
Wha-- what I did for love.
I just wanted to say thank you for being my first patient.
Ow.
ow.
ow.
ow.
Let go.
Iet go.
Iet go.
Iet go!
You need a sports bra to run this thing.
So what would you like to do to Neil first?
Well.
the first thing is a surprise.
but the second thing is bury you.
Ooh.
hot.
Can I see you for a minute?
She was-- she was looking right at me.
Hold on.
hold on.
I just want to tell you that Stan is fine.
- What?
- There never was any surgery.
The doctor says he only has a little angina.
Wow.
What a time to find out your husband's a hermaphrodite.
So you were just playing with us when we were trying to help you?
By competing to see who I would show my weakness to?
- Karen.
you're right.
I-- - Bah-bah-ta-ta-ta-ta-bah-bah-bah.
You played with me and you lost.
Let that be a lesson to you.
I think you forgot.
kiddies.
Karen Walker doesn't do emotions.
Now get the hell out of here.
So.
who wins the money?
Nobody.
We got to split it back up again.
Rosie: Oh.
okay.
- Rosie: It's gone!
- Will: What?
!
Who-- Jack!
Mrs. Walker, - I meant to give you that earlier.
- Oh.
It's some of your husband's personal things.
Thanks.
Doc.
So.
you must feel pretty good.
Your husband's gonna be fine.
You two really dodged a bullet today.
Believe me.
honey.
he's so happy to be alive.
I'm gonna be dodging it all night.
Oh.
Stanley.
you and your pudgy little fingers.
Karen.
I just want to apolo-- oh.
um-- um.
um.
I'll leave.
No!
No.
don't.
Do you want me to stay?
I thought I was gonna lose him.
Grace.
It's funny, you know, we go through life pretty much alone.
and then one day you meet someone and you hit it off.
You have some laughs.
some tenderness.
and then.
after a dozen Cosmos and a private dick's review of his liquid assets.
wham.
you're married.
Then.
as quickly as it came.
it's taken away.
But-- but nothing's been taken away.
Stan's fine.
Yeah.
but someday he might not be.
What do I do then?
That man is everything to me.
Maybe that's the blessing that's come out of all of this.
You know.
having Stan almost you know.
made you realize just how much love you've got for him.
I guess that's the trick.
to remember that love and-- and to show it to him every day.
You're right.
Maybe I'll give him a little booby later.
That sounds very romantic.
Thank you.
Grace.
Okay.
- Does this mean you forgive me?
- Yeah.
you're off the hook.
Just as long as nobody finds out about this.
- About what?
- That's my girl.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Oh, Grace as long as we're being all warm and fuzzy here.
you know how I always get on your case about the way you dress and the way you do your hair?
Uh-huh.
Well.
really when are you gonna do something about it?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Where's the key?
Where's the key?
Will.
you're just setting yourself up.
we're not gonna win.
I need the phone!
I need the phone!
Who are you.
Vinnie Two-Times?
Stop saying everything twice.
Okay.
okay.
Okay.
Why are you not more excited about this?
This is front-row seats to a sold out Joni Mitchell concert.
You love her.
Will.
regular people don't win these things.
It's just losers who have their radio station on speed dial.
Oh.
Will!
You do what you want but you are on your own.
I'm not gonna get myself all pumped up about something.
just to be devastated when it doesn't happen.
Hello?
I got someone.
Oh my God.
we're gonna win.
we're gonna win.
I knew it!
Hi.
my name is-- get off the phone!
Jack: No, you get offthe phone.
- Hang up!
- No.
you hang up.
- You're such a child.
- Nuh-uh.
you're the child.
Give me the phone.
that's my phone.
- It's my apartment.
- It is not your apartment!
Between 10:00 and 5:00 it is.
You know the deal.
That deal only exists in your head.
- Give me the pho-- - No!
Oh my God.
naked pictures of James Van Der Beek.
What?
Where?
I knew he'd crack.
- Busy.
- This call better be important.
I was talking Rory through a very tragic body wax that nearly cost him a teat.
It is important.
It is Joni Mitchell and if we are the 105th caller.
we win front-row seats.
Okay.
easy does it.
geekalicious.
It's not like it's brunch with Cher.
Oh my God!
How great would that be?
More huevos rancheros.
Jack.
Oh.
yes I'll hold.
I'm holding.
Oh God.
please.
just give me this one thing and I will dedicate myself completely to Thee.
Okay.
maybe not completely because.
you know.
I have a life.
But trust me.
I will make it so worth your while.
Really God.
if you think about it.
it's win-win.
Hi.
yes.
my name is Will Truman.
I love your radio station.
I even have it on speed dial.
They're laughing at me.
I'm sorry?
I'm the 105th caller?
I won.
Could you just hold on for a minute.
please?
Hi.
yes I'm back.
Truman.
So.
now what are you gonna do.
Grace.
huh?
You made a promise to the big girl upstairs.
What?
!
I'm talking about the Lord.
Jack.
just-- You don't want to mess with the Almighty.
Grace.
You don't want to go to hell.
You know what heat and sulfur does to your hair.
Stop it!
I have every intention of keeping my promise.
Thank you.
yeah.
We won!
I know and that's why I'm gonna do something for charity.
- Good for you.
- And?
And very good for you.
You and I have to do something to deserve these tickets.
This is not about miracles or divine intervention.
okay?
I had the skill to be the 105th caller.
Don't-- no.
I'm not doing charity.
Look.
Iook.
I'm sorry.
I'm hung up on this.
so we can either drag this out or we can just shorthand it.
Shorthand.
- Will.
do it.
- No.
- Please?
Come on.
- No.
All right.
God.
you two are so married.
Jack: Oh my God.
Karen.
I'm so excited.
I've never been in your closet.
before.
Well.
don't get your hopes up.
honey.
you'll just be disappointed.
My God!
If my closet were like this.
I never would have come out of it.
Oh Lord.
there's nothing here.
I mean why do we have to do this?
Hey.
Grace hit me up to give clothes to charity too.
It was hard but I dug deep and I gave away two bags of Will's favorite sportcoats.
Yeah.
but I mean look around.
Jack.
What could I possibly give away?
I'll take these.
The color really brings out my ass.
Come on.
focus!
We're not here for you.
we're here for the homeless.
They are so lucky!
I hope they know how lucky they are.
All right.
well.
Iet's just jump in.
Okay.
here is a sweater.
here is a hat.
Here's my arm.
here's my heart.
I can't do this!
Karen.
of course you can do this.
No.
I can't!
It's like giving away your own children.
No.
it's harder.
You can always have another kid but Hermès only made this print once.
Now.
give me one good reason why a man can't go out in a nice pillbox hat.
Hello.
reason.
Oh my God.
Iook.
There are actually pills in here.
Come on.
put that away and help me out.
Every item has such sentimental value.
I mean.
take this dress-- Stan gave it to me on our honeymoon and to this day.
every time I wear it.
he can't keep his hands off of me.
Sayonara.
You have a phone call.
Hey.
don't just barge in here barking orders at me.
I'm in the middle of the hardest thing I've ever had to do!
It's your pharmacist.
Honey.
I have to take this.
Go ahead.
I can handle it.
Oh.
you can handle it?
lnteresting.
I have spent most of my adult life and millions of my husband's dollars learning about fashion.
What are your qualifications.
hm?
Umm I'm gay.
Oh honey.
what would I do without you?
You never have to worry about that.
Oh!
Ew.
I'll start with the Puccis and Guccis and work my way to Fioruccis and Susan Luccis.
"Once I was lost but now I am found".
Hi.
I'm Grace Adler.
this is my friend Will Truman.
I called this morning.
Because I believe.
as I'm sure you do.
that helping people-- Oh yes.
I remember.
You had me on the phone for 45 minutes.
I get it.
you care.
you care.
God bless you.
I guess-- I guess that's a little redundant.
I mean.
of course you're gonna get blessed.
I mean-- think of who you're married to.
I mean.
think of who your father-in-law is.
whoa!
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
I don't know from nuns.
We generally ask our volunteers to put in a minimum of five hours per week.
Five?
!
Yeah That-- you know-- my schedule is so nuts right now.
between work and trying to have a social life.
no offense.
I thought maybe it'd be best if l-- Will.
she does not want your checkbook charity.
What she wants is us to give of our time.
Ooh.
you're one of those.
We're willing to do anything for anybody at any time.
As long as it's between Well.
Iet's see.
what have we got left?
Our community bazaar is this weekend and there's an opening - on the entertainment committee.
- Oh.
that's perfect!
Will and l. when we were in college.
we had this little improv group-- The Zanies.
Come on.
Will.
We're zany!
Okay.
I think I should tell you.
you won't be doing the entertaining.
Really?
Well.
we'll see.
When do we start?
You can start right now.
Follow me.
Our production of "Stone Soup" is this Saturday afternoon.
You two can direct the children and narrate the story.
Oh!
This is gonna be great.
kids love me.
I'm trying to help!
Okay.
we-- we gotta slow down here.
I don't think I can do this.
This is a little more than I bargained for.
Come on.
you said you were gonna help.
And I wanna help.
but directing a bunch of screaming kids?
Mister.
will you save our play?
Let's make magic.
people.
Will: "and once all the vegetables were in the pot, the mysterious stranger stirred it into a rolling boil".
"And the villagers cheered because they knew they'd be enjoying the delicious stone soup that they all made together".
- Okay guys.
say your line.
- No.
the other line.
- Yay!
All right.
good one!
Everybody grab a cookie and gather round.
- Are you two married?
- Married?
No.
I'm never ever gonna get married.
Girls are yucky!
Right back at you.
broc.
You read too fast.
You forgot half your lines.
Iittle Miss Roughage.
Grace?
!
That carrot has been giving me attitude for three days.
If she doesn't watch out.
she'll end up in a juicer.
She's six.
Nurse Ratchet.
- I'm just trying to help.
- Don't try so hard.
Relax.
Besides.
it's all gonna be over in a few hours and then tonight Joni Mitchell!
Oh my God.
I can't wait.
I was a free man in Paris I was unfettered and alive Okay Iet's just leave it to Joni.
What do you think?
I thought you liked my singing.
Huh.
Okay.
Now.
this afternoon.
remember to speak up and don't turn your backs to the audience.
okay?
And have a good time because it's gonna be the best play ever.
right?
Right!
- We're gonna have a lot of fun.
right?
- Right!
We're all gonna keep our costumes nice and clean until then.
right?
And after the show.
we're all gonna go out for ice cream.
right?
Right!
By the way.
we're totally not doing that.
Okay.
now the play starts at 5:00.
which means everybody should be in their costumes.
ready to go at what time?
-  - 4:30.
exactly!
Wait a minute.
children.
I have something I need to say.
Oh.
that ferkochta flu will be the death of me.
Anyway.
since you all have done such a good job.
Father Gallagher has decided to make the play the finale of tonight's bazaar.
Yay!
Be here at 7:30.
you go on at 8:00.
- Yay!
- 8:00?
!
See.
we have plans at 8:00.
We have front-row seats for Joni Mitchell at 8:00.
so we have to go.
I mean you would do the same thing.
I've never been beyond that fence.
I can't believe this.
we're gonna miss Joni Mitchell.
What can we do?
We made a commitment.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
- No one ever said charity was easy.
- Yeah.
You know I'd go back there tomorrow But for the work I've taken on-- Sweetie.
don't make it worse than it already is.
Look at this place.
It's virtually empty.
Jack really cleaned me out.
I heard an echo this morning in the fur vault.
Yeah.
yeah.
you are a giver.
And I think we've got a yes.
Yeah!
It doesn't work.
What-- what the hell do you know about fashion?
You're packed in there tighter than a blood sausage.
Hey.
you washed up on the shore of this country in an inner tube wearing a banana leaf and a couple of coconuts.
Listen.
Iady.
I flew here on business class with my AAdvantage miles.
Now take it off so I can clean it and burn it.
The only thing that's gonna burn is your arm when I put my cigarette out on it.
Try to remember that the next time you open up your boca!
It's the scarf.
isn't it?
- It's a cleaner look without it.
- Okay.
What about the shoes?
Oh come on.
you didn't even have to ask.
Oh.
Miss Karen.
you love those shoes like your own husband.
Bite your tongue.
Husbands come and go but the Chanel slingback is forever.
- Oh!
- Santa Maria!
My slingbacks!
They were one of a kind.
What have you done with them?
What have you done with my shoes?
Nobody like to see you squirm more than I do.
but I would eat the food you provide for me before I would touch those pumps.
Who could have done such a horrible thing?
Who would be stupid enough to take those pumps?
Now sound it out-- mysterious.
What.
what are you doing?
Nothing.
I was just giving Megan here some notes on her performance.
- I'm gonna be the narrator.
-  - But.
Grace.
you're the narrator.
- I know that.
You know.
I just think that we all should have an understudy.
- You know.
with the flu going around-- - She's going to Joni Mitchell.
I am.
What?
You-- Come here.
You drag me into this and now you're going to Joni Mitchell?
I got the tickets.
if anyone should be going to Joni Mitchell.
it's me.
How could you be so selfish?
Hey.
Will.
come on.
the carrot already knows my part anyway.
Okay.
Grace.
you wanna go?
Go!
Oh no.
you're not gonna lay a guilt trip on me.
- I'm staying.
- Good.
stay.
Will.
I'm not staying.
it's Joni Mitchell!
I can't believe you're doing this half an hour before the show!
- Come on.
it's not like I planned this.
- There's a taxi here for Grace Adler.
Okay.
that is downright spooky.
I should probably go check on that.
Yeah.
run along.
Go take your big yellow taxi.
I thought she'd never leave.
Lord.
would you look at these people.
Why anybody would choose to be homeless is beyond me.
Karen.
nobody chooses to be homeless.
It's because they did something bad.
I can't bear to think of my babies in a disease-ridden hellhole like this.
Karen.
this is a church.
Don't lecture me.
Saint Mary.
this is your fault.
- Just go find my shoes.
- All right.
all right.
Jeez!
Excuse me.
you must get this all the time.
are you Mary Todd Lincoln?
No.
and you must get this all the time-- could you take one giant step back?
Okay.
I'm so sorry.
I have to ask you-- are you the gentleman who yells obscenities outside Papaya King?
Yeah.
that's me.
Oh.
I knew it was you.
You're very good.
As an actor myself.
I just have to ask you.
how do you tap into all that rage?
Try not eating for a week.
Ooh.
I wish I had that kind of willpower.
What do you want?
What are you after?
What are your terms?
- 10.
Seven.
- One.
Three.
- Yellow.
- Wha-- uh.
blue.
- Five.
- Five?
- Five.
- All right.
five it is.
- 100.
200.
3-- - Oh.
I can't wait.
five whole dollars!
Right.
Yeah.
five whole dollars.
You drive a hard bargain.
Okay.
I don't know how that got in there but there you go.
honey.
Wow.
five dollars!
This is my lucky day.
Uh.
crazy!
Make it your lucky year.
Come on.
Thanks.
Karen.
I saw what you did just there.
You saw nothing.
Karen has a heart.
Karen has a heart.
Oh.
all right!
I don't even know why I did it.
Maybe it's like it says in the Bible-- "I felt bad because I had no shoes.
but-- then I met someone who had really bad shoes".
"Once upon a time.
there was a village where people didn't know the value of giving" Megan.
Megan!
"And one day.
a muster-- - a meester"-- - Mysterious.
"And one day.
a mysterious - stra-- stran--" - Stranger.
Grace: "And one day, a mysterious stranger came to the village and taught the town folk a valuable lesson and that was the story of Stone Soup".
- When do we bow?
- Now.
- You guys were great.
- Flawless!
And the broccoli.
carrot.
radish-- fantastic.
Onion.
you brought a tear to my eye.
All right.
everybody go say hi to your parents.
You were great.
- Good job.
- Here we go.
So.
what happened?
Well.
you know.
I was just sitting there trying to enjoy the concert but all I kept thinking about were the kids and their bright little faces.
I was asked to leave the concert for singing too loud by Joni.
At least.
Melissa Manchester had the courtesy to call security.
Anyway.
it was-- it was like I had it coming.
You know?
Anyway.
I'm so glad I got back here.
you know.
even though all the kids still hate me.
- What?
- I don't hate you.
Grace.
I like you.
I think you're pretty.
Out of the mouths of radishes.
- You do?
- Yes.
That is so sweet.
See.
this makes it all worth it.
Yes and when I grow up.
I want to have fake hair just like yours.
Now that's what makes it all worth it.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Okay.
a-- a-- a school report.
two pieces of paper.
a hemline in a hurry.
What?
I don't know.
Give me another clue.
Uh.
your Aunt Honey's stomach.
- Things that are stapled!
- Thank you.
Yeah!
All right!
Great time?
- 22 seconds.
- Okay.
not bad.
If they don't get the next one in seven seconds.
we won.
- Shorthand.
we won.
- Ha!
Okay.
good luck.
you guys.
You can do it!
And here we go!
Me and you.
- People who are getting married.
- Correct.
What?
Well.
you know.
we've thinking about it.
- and we just fi-- - What.
in four seconds?
They must have cheated.
They suck at this.
This is the-- Maniac.
they're not playing the game.
they're making an announcement.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Congratulations!
And we won.
Hey.
I have a chilled bottle of very expensive champagne.
which I have been saving for a special occasion.
Who wants coffee?
Um.
Will.
there's actually one more question I need to pop.
Um.
will you be my best man?
Rob.
you are not only my friend.
you're my accountant.
and any guy that can figure out a way to deduct Jack McFarland as an entertainment expense.
come here.
Wait.
wait.
wait.
Okay.
we're not done.
Grace.
would be my maid of honor?
Oh my God.
Ellen.
That is so sweet.
Come here.
No.
What?
!
Wh--  - Well.
why?
- Well.
gosh.
you don't want two redheads in the wedding party.
It's a red menace.
Since when.
Grace?
Since never.
I made it up.
- I'll do it!
- Oh!
- Of course I will!
- Thank you.
Grace!
I am so.
so jazzed about all this.
You know.
you guys.
you're the best.
and-- and we hate to cut this evening short.
but we got to break the big news to everyone in our line dancing club.
Oh.
well.
While you're there.
you might want to break the news that line dancing is over.
- You kidder.
- You guys are the best.
Love you guys.
- Congratulations.
- Bye.
The red menace?
What was that about?
Oh.
um.
you know.
I just-- I just have this issue with Ellen.
It's a long complicated story.
- So give me the short version.
- I slept with Rob.
Good night.
Whoa!
No.
no.
no.
no.
no-no-no-no.
Gonna need the long complicated version.
Go.
Okay.
Danny and I had just broken up.
Ellen and Rob were going through another of their breakups.
In a nutshell.
chance encounter at a restaurant.
Rain.
booze.
sympathy.
knees touching.
more booze.
more rain.
more sympathy.
cab ride and then stuff.
I can't believe you haven't told me this.
I mean.
there was that time last April when I was so depressed.
and this would have pulled me right out of it.
yeah.
You see.
this is exactly why I didn't tell you.
Because I knew that you would enjoy it.
that you would make jokes and judge me and call me names.
and-- Grace.
give me a little credit.
- You little minx.
- All right.
that's it.
Okay.
bachelor party.
Let's review what we've got so far.
My name in bubble letters and then a picture of a man on a donkey.
I got nothing.
Oh my God.
I got a donkey.
too.
Well.
you know why we're blocked.
'Cause heterosexual marriage is just wrong.
I mean.
if God had intended man and woman to be together.
he would have given them both penises.
I believe I heard Pope RuPaul Il say that.
I know.
a progressive spa party.
We'll go from one lovely bachelor's pad to the next.
And at each place we'll do a different treatment.
A steam facial here.
a deep pore cleansing there.
and then knock-knock.
"Hello.
seaweed wrap"?
"Yes.
come on in".
That is the gayest thing I've ever heard.
I know.
Isn't it yummy?
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Will.
I can't do this bridal shower.
I am so racked with guilt.
I'm delusional.
I'm making the finger sandwiches.
and they're all giving me the finger.
Why so guilty?
What'd you do?
Will and Grace: Stuff.
Look.
I'm having a bachelor party here.
You're having the shower in your place.
If you start to freak out.
come over and get me.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
- Okay.
- All right.
Okay.
Oh.
oh.
oh.
I know.
I know what this is.
Will told me everything.
Grace.
you really did it this time.
Oh.
oh.
- You told him I slept with Rob?
- Uh.
no.
Works every time.
Listen to me.
Chatty Cathy.
You keep this to yourself.
Not a word.
We do not speak of this again.
You understand?
You little minx.
That was fun.
Now I'm hungry.
- Take me to Black Angus.
Sss.
- No.
no.
We got to figure this bachelor party thing out.
so.
I mean.
just think.
Straight world is backwards world.
so what is the absolute last thing you and I would want to see at a party?
Hi.
I'm Sergeant Goodbody.
and I'm here to give Rob a citation for being a very bad boy.
Oh my God.
a stripper!
You know.
Rob.
as your attorney.
I would usually advise against this sort of thing.
but as your friend.
I say par-tay har-tay.
Did I do that right?
- I think you have to add a "whoo-hoo".
- Whoo-hoo!
- Karen?
- Hi.
honey.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
I was just taking a little walk.
You don't walk.
Well.
I was just going out for a little snack.
You don't eat solid foods.
I love you.
Oh.
right.
right.
Oh.
Stan's mother's in town.
Oh.
I'm telling you.
she's evil!
I'm being tortured in my own home.
She's irresponsible.
she's lazy.
she drinks.
And worst of all.
she makes fun of what I wear!
What are you supposed to say to a woman like that?
Uh.
Karen.
may I take your coat?
Thanks.
honey.
Karen.
you cannot stay.
Ellen is gonna be here any second for her bridal shower.
and she's bringing a couple of friends from Weehawken.
Oh.
come on.
Let me stay.
I've always wanted to see those people up close instead of driving through their habitat and having 'em jump on the hood of the car.
Come on.
No.
No.
Karen.
Ellen is a dear friend of mine.
and she's entrusted me with the responsibility of being the maid of honor and I take it very.
very.
very seriously.
Oh my God.
you slept with the groom.
What?
!
How did you-- well.
what did you-- do you have three sixes on your head?
No.
but I got a fifth in my bloodstream.
Even in an adulteress's apartment.
I'm funny.
Oh.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
So.
who'd like the first lap dance?
- Rob.
- Oh.
gosh.
I don't know.
I mean.
Ellen's across the hall and I've got that hiatal hernia.
Well.
uh.
Steve?
Nah.
I can tell she doesn't like me.
Okay.
Ira.
she's all yours.
My lap's a little tender right now.
- What does that mean?
- Just leave me alone.
All right.
damn it.
I'll do it.
I mean.
I've copped a feel.
Might as well feel a cop.
All right.
come to Poppa.
Okay.
we're gonna sit down now.
and you're gonna pretend like you're a human being.
- You little minx.
- Not a word!
- Ellen.
hi!
- Hi!
- Welcome to your shower.
- Oh my God.
my shower!
- Come on in.
- Hi.
And you've done one of your picnics.
- Isn't it fun?
- Oh.
so much fun.
I can't believe how much fun.
Grace.
everything is really cute.
I hope you didn't put yourself out.
Oh.
too late.
Jack?
Jack.
what's going on?
Why did you run out in the middle of your lap dance?
Does your ass have attention deficit disorder.
too?
Well.
something really bad happened.
I got-- I got excited.
You mean excited like I-want-to-wear-what-she's-wearing excited?
No.
excited the way the three of the four Baldwins and one of the two Quaids get me excited.
Oh my God.
it's finally happened.
You've gotten so gay.
you've looped around to straight again.
This isn't funny.
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
- I'm freaked out right now-- - Calm down.
- I know exactly what to do.
- What?
Tell Grace!
Oh my God.
Jack got turned on by a woman?
Well.
he couldn't be straight.
so what.
now he's a lesbian?
Well.
he's got the haircut for it.
So.
how's it going for you.
sleep-around Sue?
What happened to "minx"?
I'm saving that for just the right moment.
- Minx.
- Can we stop?
I'm sorry.
You drop a bomb like you and Rob sleeping together and.
what.
- I'm supposed to let it go?
- Will.
please.
Little dirty.
dirty.
cutie-cutie.
sleeping with Robbie-Robbie-- - Oh.
- Oh!
Will.
Iisten.
is it okay if we watch "The English Patient"?
What?
That's not a happy face.
Ellie.
we were broken up.
I mean.
I was a mess.
I was out of my head.
He's right.
You know.
when a man gets that low.
he'll reach for anything.
anything.
Yup.
that's me.
I'm the step you take right before the gun.
Somebody tell that skank not to talk to me.
And you.
Mr. Man.
are worse that a skank.
You're a skunk who sleeps with skank!
Skunk!
Skank!
Okay.
okay.
Ellen.
I-- I'm so sorry but could we just agree that kind of language is uncalled for?
The wedding's off.
Grace.
- Oh.
Ellen.
you can't-- - Ahh!
I am so humiliated and disappointed.
and I just pray to God our friends never find out about this.
Everybody, Rob slept with Grace.
The wedding is off.
You and your big mouth!
Me?
What about him and his big mouth?
!
You know.
as far as I'm concerned.
you both have big mouths.
I slept with Grace.
Wedding's off.
What do you want to do?
Go in there.
get Rob.
we will work this out together.
No.
no.
I can't go in there.
Everybody hates me.
Grace.
I promise you.
no one is even thinking of you.
right now.
okay?
All right.
okay.
- Hi.
everybody.
-  What were you thinking?
!
- Poodle!
- Oh.
Karen!
I know.
I know.
I know.
Honey.
Will told me.
Listen.
I'm sure it's just a fluke or an allergic reaction.
I mean.
Stan's head swells when he eats a peanut.
Karen.
I know the difference between 6:00 and 12:00.
and this was midnight at the oasis.
All right.
all right.
Well.
come on.
Iet's try a little reenactment and see if we can figure out what happened.
Sit down.
Okay.
Now.
she probably started out with a little of this action.
Ohh.
yeah!
Well.
she wasn't really that boob-intensive.
She just kind of sat on my lap and moved around a lot.
Oh.
well.
then it was just simple friction.
Okay.
come on.
Here we go.
Okay.
all right.
This is the way the wheel goes round The wheel goes round.
the wheel goes round Karen.
you're chafing me.
Just give me another couple seconds.
It's not working.
Maybe not for you.
It's no use.
I'm a freak.
I'm an aberration.
I'm a man that gets turned on by women.
But not by me?
You know.
that hurt.
You should be careful what you say.
You should realize that words are weapons.
you little sissy!
Now.
wake up down here!
Karen!
This isn't about you.
this is about me and this sickness I have.
Jack?
I've been looking for you.
I still owe you half a lap dance.
Um.
could you just give it to the needy?
Look.
I never do this.
but I think you're really cute.
so if you change your mind.
here's my card.
Oh.
that's very nice of you.
I don't think I'll be changing my mind any time soon.
Carl.
so-- because I'm a-- You're a Carl?
From the waist down.
From the waist up.
I'm Carla.
So.
you're not a girl?
Not yet.
but God willing.
by fall I will be.
Oh.
thank God.
I'm still gayer than Christmas.
All right.
speaking of half-women.
I gotta get back to Stan's mother.
Oh.
hey!
Hey.
say.
come on.
come with me.
We'll scare the crap out of her and you'll get you $1.000 closer to your snippity-doo-da day.
Come on!
Ellen.
peaches.
Iisten.
The thing between Grace and me meant nothing.
That's right.
El.
nothing.
- It was just a meaningless encounter.
- A wrong detour.
A pathetic.
miserable act between two desperate.
sweaty people.
Did I say that out loud?
Look.
El.
she was nothing compared to you.
You know I don't like bony girls.
It was like-- it was like having sex with a cricket.
Yeah?
Well.
I was fake chirping.
- Please come out.
- Please.
Ellen.
I'm not talking to Skunk or Skank.
I will only talk to Will.
Cricket?
I'm so never sleeping with you again!
Ellen.
I know you're hurting.
but there's something you got to know.
Rob is hurting too.
- Do you have any condoms?
- Top drawer.
Well.
I mean.
he-- he loves you.
He cares for you.
- I'm sorry.
condoms?
- Yeah.
we're having sex.
It's the only way to even the score with Rob and Grace.
- It has to be done.
- Okay.
wait-- so.
slow down.
- One of us is gay.
- Yeah.
get over it.
Now.
I want you to throw me on the bed and have your beastie way with me.
Ellen.
that is not gonna happen.
You and I are not gonna-- oh my God.
you're in a bra.
Get a load of these torpedoes.
Ellen.
damn the torpedoes.
Give it over to your mama.
Stop!
Stop.
stop.
Look.
I know you're in pain.
but this is no way to deal with it.
I mean.
Iook at you.
Iook what you're doing.
Oh my God.
you're right.
Oh my God.
Iook at me.
What is wrong with me?
I'm just a dumb.
stupid idiot-head.
Oh.
Ellen.
it's okay.
It's-- it's just-- Now.
I'm gonna grind you like fresh cup of coffee.
Don't worry.
Will is fantastic in these kind of situations.
Trust me.
he will not come out of there until he has fixed this.
Yeah.
yeah.
you're right.
I-- I give up!
All right.
forget it!
I-- this has gotten way out of hand.
There's a crazy woman in there coming at me like-- Iike Chucky in a C-cup.
- What now?
- You know what?
There's only one person who can make this right.
Hey.
I'm not going back in there unless she is sedated or trussed up like a turkey.
I'm talking about me.
Will!
Oh.
right.
yes.
go.
- Good for you.
- Come on.
Iet's do it.
- You can do it!
- We got faith in you.
buddy.
Go.
Rob!
- Never gonna happen.
- He's a dead man.
Oh God.
what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I know!
I know!
I'll do what I did in college.
Oh.
Grace.
I got rid of my bong years ago.
Not that.
Whenever Ellen or I would get into a fight in college.
I would make her a tunnel-of-fudge bundt cake.
We would talk.
we would eat.
and somehow everything would work out okay.
Of course.
much like the apple brown Betty that ended the Battle of Guadalcanal.
Grace.
we don't have time.
Don't you see that I have to do something?
I mean.
Ellen is one of my oldest and dearest friends.
I mean.
when my father was sick.
Ellen was there.
When I didn't get into that Paris program.
Ellen was there.
And then when-- and when Danny and I broke up.
Ellen was-- well.
Rob was there.
but-- but Ellen was just a few blocks away.
God.
now I've totally ruined their marriage.
Rob: Oh!
Ho, ho!
- Was that you?
- Huh-uh.
- So that means that was-- - Uh-huh.
- Right there in your-- - Oh.
yeah.
- Let's get out of here.
- No.
I can't go anywhere until I know that Ellen's forgiven me.
- Ellen.
have you forgiven Grace?
- Ellen: Oh God, yes.
Good enough for me.
- Want to get something to eat?
- No.
I want to get some new sheets.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey.
looking good.
I'm having an insect invasion.
New York roaches are getting way too bold.
I just found one wearing a pair of my shoes.
Look at you two.
with the cologne and the tightness.
- Where are you going?
- This new club downtown.
Yeah.
it's where the old club downtown used to be.
Oh.
oh.
great!
Okay.
just gimme two minutes.
Both: Ooh!
What "Ooh"?
I love gay bars.
I always go to gay bars.
There's not a gay bar in town I haven't been to with you guys.
Okay.
just figured out what why I'm alone and dateless on a Saturday night.
You have a boyfriend.
Call Josh.
No.
he'll just want to see some chick flick and then talk about it.
I wanna-- I wanna go with you guys.
No.
I'm sorry.
We're having a meeting of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club.
No girls aloud.
Right.
Spanky?
Me.
too.
neither.
Hmmph.
Fine.
I don't need you two to have fun.
I have a big night planned.
- Ant traps are under the kitchen sink.
- Thanks.
Uh.
Val?
Hey.
Hi.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I was just doing a little some-- something for the security camera.
Little gift for the boys in the basement.
Shut up.
I do the same thing.
I hate to disappoint you both.
but that's not a security camera.
that's a smoke detector.
- Val.
do you know Jack?
- No.
Val.
the lunachick who got in a catfight with Grace and tore her clothes off?
Speaking.
- I am such a big fan of your work.
- Ooh.
thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
you guys want to go have a cookout on my fire escape.
- 'cause I got a new hibachi?
- Ooh.
tempting.
No.
we're going to a club.
- Oh.
really?
- It's all you can eat after midnight.
- I didn't know they served food.
- They don't.
Well.
I guess I'm the only loser with nothing to do on a Saturday night then.
Get off.
get off.
get off!
- And then there were two.
- Nighty-night.
- Hey.
- Val?
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.
I-- I think the last time I saw you.
you were smashing my face into the carpet.
Well.
it looks like that burn above your eye went away.
Actually.
I just stopped plucking in that area.
- I just got ditched by two gay guys.
- Oh my God!
Me too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey.
well.
do you want to kill bugs and watch infomercials?
I'm wearing pointed shoes.
You're on!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh.
good.
I like your hat.
I got one in faux fur.
Oh my God.
They're pulling her whole face off.
- Ew.
ew.
ew!
- Oh.
I love this show.
Can you imagine doing that to your face?
I would never do plastic surgery.
It's gross.
I know.
It's so demeaning.
- Pathetic.
- Totally.
I might do my eyes.
Well.
sure.
That's medical.
I'm also thinking of getting a butt lift.
Not surgical.
just pay some guy to walk behind me and carry it.
If I'm not married by the time I'm 35.
I'm doing my boobs.
That's not medical.
Sure.
it is.
I want to marry a doctor.
My ex-husband wanted me to get a boob job.
and so I got rid of him.
Well.
that and the fact that he was sleeping with his dental hygienist.
Why is it always the hygienist?
What is it?
Is it the white uniforms?
The latex gloves?
I think it's because they're whores.
Well.
hey.
Lady La-La.
What are you doing in here?
Oh.
Stan's been socking down the herbal Viagra again.
and this is the only room in the house he doesn't know about.
Shh.
Karen.
guess what?
Tonight I met the one-- the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.
Hey!
There is only one man in your life.
and her name is Rosario and don't you forget that.
His name is Bill.
Iook.
And he gave me a picture of himself.
Isn't that a great idea?
I'm gonna start passing out pictures of myself to people I meet at clubs.
Honey.
did you even read this?
Well.
I read the picture.
And it said.
"Mommy.
Mommy.
gimme some of Jack".
Ah!
He is the head of some group called "Welcome Back Home".
Well.
I'm sure it's a typo.
He must mean.
"Welcome Back.
Homo".
"It's never too late to get back on the straight and narrow"?
Honey.
this is a cult.
Yeah.
Iike the Moonies or the homeless.
Yes.
they're trying to make gay people straight.
Good Lord.
Don't they know what that'll do to the fall line?
"Renounce your homosexuality"?
"Make the choice to be straight"?
"Gay is not the way"?
Jennifer Jason Leigh.
these people are freaks!
Yes.
and it looks like your new sweetie has turned his back on homosexuals.
and not in the good way.
no.
Don't listen.
Bill is not straight.
I mean.
Iook at us.
Karen.
We're lovers.
Lord.
I wonder if Stan's exhausted himself on the body pillow yet.
Wait.
They're having a meeting tomorrow.
We have to go.
What this organization is advocating is morally wrong.
and it is my responsibility to shine the mirror of truth upon them.
Honey.
- Okay.
I want to make out with Bill.
- Okay.
Ooh.
he's so cute.
isn't he?
I know.
I know.
honey.
but it's a waste of time.
all right?
It's like exercise or reading to your kids.
The man thinks he's straight.
There are no straight men.
only men who haven't met Jack.
Yeah.
Well.
you can count me out.
If you think I'm gonna spend my Sunday morning with a bunch of self-loathing closet cases-- - You get to be a lesbian.
- Wake me by 11:00.
So.
Val.
what are you doing Tuesday night?
Tuesday night?
Oh.
I'm going to a movie and then out to dinner.
- With you.
silly person!
- Oh.
yay!
Wow!
- Yay.
- Wow!
If these walls could talk.
So.
how was girl's night out?
I dunno.
I got hit on by a guy named Beverly.
which.
you know.
in England.
is a very common name for-- for women.
- Bye.
Val.
- 'Night.
guys.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Wow.
So.
no bruises.
no cuts.
no torn clothing?
- What the hell happened?
- We had so much fun.
I don't think that I've laughed that hard since you and-- that's odd.
My music box is missing.
What?
The music box my Dad gave me for my Bat Mitzvah.
Did you borrow it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I took it to the bar with me.
Nothing says "Hey.
there" Iike a pop-up ballerina.
It was here.
Val even-- even commented on it.
- You don't think she - What?
stole it?
I mean.
she has tried battery on you.
why not theft?
Well.
I hope you're happy.
Thanks to you.
I didn't sleep all night.
Well.
I've got news for you.
mister.
Val did not steal my music box.
- She is my friend and I trust her.
- Okay.
Which is why we are breaking into her apartment.
so I can prove to you that it is not there.
Great.
just give me a minute to get my black leotard and suction cups and I'll meet you on the side of the building.
Hurry up.
-  - Grace!
Understand what you're doing?
This is breaking and entering.
We can't go to prison.
We're too pretty.
Relax.
I'm the president of the tenant's board.
I'm allowed to go into any apartment in which I suspect a gas leak.
But you don't suspect a gas leak.
Man.
you're not gonna last two minutes in the slam.
Wow!
Now we know who's buying everything on eBay.
Okay.
come on.
Let's start looking.
Man.
Iook at all these snow globes.
"Greetings from Times Square".
Aw.
Grace.
Iook.
It's snowing on a hooker.
Okay.
put the hooker down.
You're so convinced she took the music box.
find it.
Actually.
Grace.
you know what I'm more convinced of?
That I don't care.
Then why would you call my friend a thief?
I take it back.
What are you.
a child?
There's no takesies backsies.
Okay.
so start looking.
It's a brown music box that plays "Hava Nagila".
Well.
you're not going to find it.
And why?
Because Val did not take it.
Well.
unless you've been using musical suppositories.
I think we've found it.
Oh.
God!
Hey.
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
What are you two doing here?
Um.
uh-- we thought you had a gas leak.
Then why do you yell surprise?
Well.
we didn't say it was a nice surprise.
My Lord.
Iook at these people.
Just because they stopped being gay doesn't mean that they have to stop having taste.
Look.
there he is.
There's Bill.
Jack: lsn't he dreamy?
Yeah.
he's a slice of ice cream cake.
When do I get to French kiss a girl?
Come on.
come on.
Patience.
Clarice.
The best way for me to get close to Bill is to act like a straight guy.
That way I can win him over and release his inner homo.
I haven't seen this many closet cases since the Academy Awards.
Well.
hello.
You must be the newcomers.
I'm Kevin.
and this is my wife Jodie.
We're one of Welcome Back Home's biggest success stories.
Four years and counting.
Can you believe that we actually used to be gay?
What?
You two?
I'm plotzing.
Help yourself to the buffet.
Forget what you think you know about corned beef hash.
And try the deviled eggs.
My Kevin made 'em.
They're world famous.
My secret is chopped scallions.
Honey.
was that two men or two women?
Jack!
You're here.
Oh my God.
it's Bill.
- Take it out of the head voice.
- Oh my God.
it's Bill.
Jack.
I'm so proud of you for coming.
As a former gay man myself.
I know how difficult it can be to take that first step.
Welcome back home.
Uh.
dude.
I came home a long time ago.
Uh.
this is Karen.
the old ball and chain.
I used to dig chicks.
Hah!
Yeah.
Oh.
well.
welcome back home to you.
too.
I'm sorry.
when I saw you at the bar last night.
I assum-- Oh.
no-no.
I was just trying to get my bud.
Will.
back on the straight and narrow again.
yeah.
He's a big fat flamer!
He's in love with me.
so-- me.
I like the ladies.
Right.
babe?
Wow.
Wow.
that is just a beautiful thing to see.
- Isn't being married great?
- Yeah.
Is there anything better?
Yeah.
riding on the back of a Harley with Angelina Jolie.
Oh!
That's why I brought her in.
- See.
she needs a tune-up.
- Yeah.
- Rrmm.
rrmm!
- Ah.
party on!
Well.
that's what we're here for.
to support you in your new life.
- Girls.
we got a slider.
- What's that?
Come on.
Karen.
You're just in time for the make-up seminar.
- We're all gonna get cheekbones.
- Oh.
well.
that's nice.
honey.
And.
uh when are we gonna learn about bras?
Well.
well.
well.
Alone at last.
In a heterosexual straight kind of way.
you know?
So.
yeah.
you want to watch the game?
What game?
You know.
foot-- skipball?
- I'm back.
- We missed you.
- I hope you like Sunny D. - I Sunny do.
Oh.
wait a sec.
Ah.
that's for you.
For you.
Are you gonna?
Okay.
Val.
I-- I don't know how to say this.
but where did you get the snow globes?
They belonged to my ex-husband.
He loved them more than anything.
So.
naturally.
I made sure that I got them in the settlement.
So you sort of got him by the globes.
I squeezed 'em real tight and I shook 'em.
shook 'em.
shook 'em!
Yeah.
Globes are fun.
You know what else I love?
This music box.
where'd you get that?
Oh.
I got that with-- with a big kitty.
they came as a set.
- How long have you had it?
- Oh.
for like forever.
Oh.
what's it play?
This old lrish song that I love.
- Sweet.
Can I hear it?
- Sure.
Gosh and begorra.
gosh and begorra Gosh and begorra.
my lrish eyes It's "Hava Nagila"!
It's not an lrish song!
It's an ancient Hebrew song about something Jewish!
My dad gave this to me for my Bat Mitzvah.
You stole it!
Grace.
I am hurt.
How can you say something like that?
Read the back.
Is your Hebrew name Rachel?
Give it to me.
- No.
it's mine!
- It's mine!
- It's mine!
It's mine!
- Hey.
hey!
All right!
Can we take a breath.
okay?
God.
you two.
I swear.
when you get together.
I know what it must be like to be the father of-- - Get off me!
- Come on.
Grace-- oh!
My globes.
What a great play.
Up high.
See.
before.
when I was gay.
that high five might have sent a tingle up my thigh straight to my home entertainment center.
But now that I'm straight.
it's just a couple of guys celebrating the ball doing something good.
Exactly.
Welcome Back Home teaches that physical contact between two men is okay.
as long as there's nothing behind it.
- That's us.
right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
How do you do it.
Iadies?
How do you stay straight with so many fine looking chicks around?
Well.
we try and keep our love life fresh.
so we don't do it that often.
Oh.
you're lucky.
Jack just wants it all the time.
And I want to please him.
but-- I don't know.
Whenever we're making love.
I just can't stop thinking about Rosario.
- Who?
- She's our maid.
but she's so much more!
Yeah.
whenever I see her up on a stepladder dusting.
my eyes just travel up those thin supple calves to those thick.
trunk-like thighs.
I just-- oh.
I should stop.
- No.
go on.
-  - Hey.
that was a great game.
- Yeah.
so.
want to hit the showers?
- What?
- You know.
Iike they're doing.
Jack.
I don't think that's appropriate.
Whaddya talk?
It's just a couple of naked straight guys soaping each other down.
Okay.
I-- I have to say something here.
The backslapping and the head rubbing was one thing.
but the ear blowing and the butterfly kisses are not standard NBA practice.
And now this shower thing?
What do you imply?
You're coming on to me.
What?
I am shocked and appalled!
But are you interested?
You think that you can just come in here and use this group.
this group that puts people back on the path of righteousness.
as some kind of dating service?
I just need a yes or no.
No.
And I want to make something crystal clear to you and to everyone else in this room.
Excuse me.
we are here to lead normal.
heterosexual lives.
Man and woman are meant to be together.
So anyone here who has a misguided notion that Welcome Back Home is some kind of a-- a gay pick-up joint.
you can just leave right now.
Well.
Iook at 'em go.
I haven't seen a stampede like this since Pamplona.
Oh!
Oh my God.
Iisten to me.
I'm a funny lesbian.
I'm Ellen.
As long as it's a heterosexual soap down.
Attagirl.
I'm so sorry I kicked you - that second time.
- Yeah.
- But you did get in the way.
- I know.
It's my fault.
I should know to wear a sports cup around you two.
- Can I ask one small question?
- Yeah.
I would alternate ice and heat on them until the feeling comes back.
Different question.
Why did you bend over backwards defending this woman.
- when it was so clear that-- - I know.
I know.
I know.
She was fun.
And I need more women in my life-- besides you.
It was big of you to forgive her.
I thought the hug was a nice touch.
Screw forgiveness.
When she was hugging me.
I stole her watch.
Grace.
you crafty little-- okay.
this is my watch.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Grace: This is so unfair.
Why do we always have to have breakfast at your house?
I have a house.
Yes.
but you have no food there.
nothing to eat with or on there.
and it smells like bologna and wet cat there.
- Since I'm already here.
- Mmm.
Cereal?
Generic bran flakes?
How geriatric.
Oh.
no.
Bran flakes kick in?
No.
it's our alumni newsletter.
Joseph Dudley retired.
- Oh.
- Heart problems.
- No!
- Yeah.
No.
Professor Dudley.
I loved him.
He was the best teacher I ever had.
and the only one who never hit on me.
Grace.
he was gay.
Ladies and Grace.
You'll be happy to know that I have found him.
Sex.
The love of my life.
And he's from Belize.
Puh-leaze.
Jack.
we're really not in the mood.
We just got some bad news.
Oh my God!
It's about James Van der Beek.
isn't it?
Is Beek off the "Creek"?
Is Jack smoking crack?
God.
he was brilliant.
you know?
- And such an inspiration.
- Yeah.
He's the one who made me want to write.
- You don't write.
- But I wanted to.
And.
you know.
when I graduated.
I told him I'd keep in touch.
and then I never did.
I feel so guilty.
Okay.
it's getting just a little too "Tuesdays With Morrie" in here.
Why don't you just go visit Jack Lemmon and get it over with?
What?
I read the movie.
You know?
I think Chrissy might actually be onto something here.
I mean.
he is-- he's our Morrie.
You know what we should do?
We should rent a car this weekend and go visit him.
Oh my God!
Yes.
Iet's do it.
I need to see him.
I need a shot of his optimism.
and positive energy.
You know.
I actually called someone a bitch the other day.
Um.
that was me.
And you were.
When are you going to realize I'm not talking to you?
Probably when you stop talking to me.
I just don't see why it was necessary to humiliate me at the Alamo desk.
I was just flirting with the cutie rent-a-guy.
By making fun of me.
Okay.
so I don't know that much about cars.
Grace.
he asked you if you wanted a V-6 or a V-8.
and you said you preferred a Diet Coke.
- I was making a joke.
- No.
you weren't.
No.
I wasn't.
but that still does not excuse two gay guys sitting there laughing in my face.
Like I don't get enough of that at home.
You owe me an apology.
- You really upset me.
- Okay.
okay.
I'm sorry you're upset.
Ho-ho!
Interesting.
It had the word "sorry" in it.
but somehow it still made the whole thing my fault.
I'm sorry you see it that way.
Okay.
there it is again.
Okay.
do you think that maybe you could take a little bit of responsibility?
!
All right.
all right.
I'm sorry that-- that when we were at the Alamo desk.
I chose this car.
because I coulda had a V-8!
Lord.
why did I agree to cook dinner for Stan on his birthday?
I must have been sober or something.
Now.
that'll never happen again.
Karen.
trust me.
I can teach you.
I've had years of experience working under some of the finest chefs in New York.
Honey.
ease up on the Giorgio.
That was so nice of you.
- Feels so good to help.
- Yeah.
Come on.
this'll be fun.
Will's away.
We can use his stuff.
make a mess.
and we don't even have to clean up.
Hey.
hey.
hey.
come on.
this is serious.
If you can't teach me how to cook.
I have to have sex with my husband.
So you better make it high fat.
because the only thing I want hardening that night are his arteries.
Ooh!
A note.
I love notes.
Jack McFarland.
do not-- I repeat.
do not.
under any circumstances.
enter this apartment.
I'm having my floors redone.
and I forbid you to walk on them.
Do you understand?
- What's it say?
- It's not for us.
Now.
Will just had the floors redone.
so we have to respect that.
- Chh-chh-chh-chh - Whoo-whoo!
- Hello?
-  Professor Dudley?
It's Will and Grace.
I'll be right there!
Oh!
Did you hear that?
He always knows just what to say.
Will.
smell this place.
It smells like knowledge.
Yeah.
knowledge mixed with tomato soup and just a hint of A and D Ointment.
- Ah.
Will Truman and Grace Adler.
- Hey!
Hi.
Professor.
If you've come for inspiration.
you're too late.
If you've come for the funeral.
you're too early.
- Hey.
you look great.
- How've you been?
How have I been?
I loathe myself.
Now.
who wants a wine cooler?
- Wow.
- I know.
Maybe we should've come on a Tuesday.
Honey.
there are a few too many things that are flaming in this kitchen.
Karen.
would you relax?
I'm toasting the croutons.
Ah!
We're being robbed!
Mrs. Walker.
we've been through this before.
Now.
I am not a prowler.
I am not a bartender.
I am not the black guy from "Designing Women".
I am your lawyer.
and maybe if you'd stop bobbing for olives for half a minute.
you might remember that.
Hm.
you're kinda hot.
Jackie!
Hello.
Benjamin.
Oh.
you're still mad 'cause I beat you at racquetball?
Uh.
you know what.
Ben?
My life's a little too hectic to be mad about losing a game or two.
- Or 12.
- Okay.
we get it!
You're huge.
You're sports cup runneth over.
Why are you here?
ls Stan in trouble again?
'Cause.
Iisten to me.
you tell that secretary of his.
one woman's sexual harassment is another woman's night off.
No.
No.
Will told me to stop by and pick up some papers.
so I'm-- Jack.
are you cooking that salad?
'cause.
you know.
it's-- it's better when you don't.
Um.
Ben.
we're buds.
we're love.
we have history.
Um.
if you look around.
this isn't the racquetball court.
I think you're a little bit out of your element here.
okay?
Well.
actually.
before I went to law school.
I was a chef.
I studied in Provence.
In fact.
I won an award for my coq au vin.
Yeah?
And I won an award for my nyeah-nyeah-nyeah.
Okay!
Well.
I'll remember that mood for when I beat you left-handed.
- See you later.
- Yeah.
wait a minute.
wait a minute.
wait a minute.
Iawyer man.
hold on a second here.
Listen.
we're in a crisis.
If I can't cook my husband rack of lamb for his birthday.
he's gonna be craving rack of me.
All right.
Well.
I'll help you.
but you have to say those magic words.
- Billable hours.
- Let's get it on.
- But.
Karen-- - Sorry.
fruit.
you're out of the loop.
Come on.
I-- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I mean.
this-- this is you.
How can you say your life has no meaning?
Yeah.
I mean.
you had such an impact.
You-- you made me want to write.
So.
you're a writer.
What have you written?
Um.
Will wants to say something.
You-- you touched so many lives.
Does that not mean anything to you?
I'm afraid that's all sound and fury signifying nothing.
Or.
to put it in layman's terms  Did the wisest man we know just go  I believe he did.
And now.
every other week.
I've got all these ex-students coming up here to visit me.
just because they've read "Tuesdays With Morrie".
How unbearably pathetic.
Hmm.
- How indeed.
- Yeah.
We've never even read that book.
So.
you haven't written anything and you haven't read anything.
I can see I've made a marvelous impact.
Uh.
I'm sorry.
This is like I'm talking to a different guy.
I mean.
you used to be so positive and so upbeat.
Now.
not to mention my role model as a-- as a strong gay man.
I mean.
what-- what happened to you?
Oh!
Why do we always have to have dinner at your house?
You know I have a house right next door.
Do you have any food over there?
Do you have anything to eat with or on.
that isn't covered in cat hair?
You're starting with me?
Very nice.
How about a little kindness.
you miserable old fairy?
Will, Grace, this is Sharon Timmer.
she's my best friend in the whole world.
The pie is frozen.
You're serving them frozen pie?
Dudley: The pie will thaw.
Sharon: When you're dead it'll thaw.
Sharon, you have all the charm ofa flesh-eating virus.
Are you gonna say it.
or am I gonna say it?
I'm gonna say it.
You had way too many onions.
Not that!
Them!
They're us!
They are not.
They're not us.
Will.
when he put down the bottle of Correctol by her lamb chop.
she said.
"Ew".
I say "Ew".
Will.
she is exactly who I'm going to be.
Who knew I gas going to develop a taste for turquoise jewelry?
I mean.
ew.
Ah!
Ew!
Ah!
Would you relax?
You're blowing this way out of proportion.
Oh my God.
that's my china pattern.
Be sure not to bruise the lettuce.
You've got to treat this salad like a lover-- gently.
sensually.
Are you getting it?
Oh.
I'm getting something.
honey.
Hmm.
doesn't look like much of a salad to me.
Where's the arugula?
Where's the radicchio?
Where's the Rwanda?
Jack.
one of those isn't a salad ingredient.
so much as a war-torn country in Africa.
Duh.
I sponsor a kid in Arugula.
Hi.
Ben.
So.
the salad's done.
the risotto is cooking.
Let's talk wine.
Karen.
you have any preference?
Honey.
I'd suck the alcohol out of a deodorant stick.
so you're asking the wrong gal.
okay?
Karen.
are you saying you don't care about the wine?
No.
honey.
I was just flirting with you.
Grace.
you're such a lovely young lady.
Tell me.
how come you're not married?
Oh.
well.
um.
I was engaged last year.
but it didn't work out.
Oh.
really?
Well.
what happened?
- Sharon.
- I'm just making conversation.
Joe.
So.
Grace.
what made you not go through with it?
Um.
well.
we were just so different.
and I wasn't ready.
and-- - And Will didn't approve.
- Sharon!
Uh.
well.
no.
he didn't.
but that's not why I didn't-- Because heaven forbid.
there should be any other man in your life besides Will.
Darling.
when the moonlight hits you like that.
I can just make out the venom glistening on your front fang.
Hey.
hey.
did anybody see that special on Discovery last night about the human liver?
It is quite the filtration system.
Interesting organ.
the liver.
Produces bile.
Joe.
I would imagine you'd have one the size of Utah.
Speaking of things the size of Utah.
have a seat.
Sharon.
Okay.
stop.
enough.
I can't take any more.
What-- what is the matter with you two?
What do you mean.
darling?
Well.
you-- you're awful to each other.
I mean.
sulfites and digestive enzymes get along better that you two.
What?
The liver has trouble breaking down sulfites-- - Sweetie.
no.
- Oh.
I mean.
you became friends for a reason.
What happened?
Well.
nothing happened per se.
In the course of a 30-year friendship.
bad patterns emerge.
difficulties arise.
It's impossible to pinpoint the-- December 15th.
1978!
Faculty cocktail party!
The topic was 19th century French literature.
You brought up Balzac.
and I thought you were making another one of your crude gay jokes.
So I responded and you mocked me in front of your whole department.
And the worst part is that you just wouldn't apologize for humiliating me like that.
Our relationship has never been the same.
Wait a minute.
that-- that's it?
That's what's eaten away at your friendship.
the way cirrhosis eats away at a human liver?
Enough with the liver!
And you.
Professor.
if you know that-- that all it would take is-- is an apology.
then apologize to your friend of 30 years.
My God.
she deserves at least that.
You're right.
You're right.
Sharon.
I'm sorry your education system failed you.
You don't know the difference between a 19th century novelist and a feeble pun unworthy of even Dick Cavett.
And Joseph.
darling.
I'm sorry the only Balzac you've thumbed in the last 20 years sits on a dusty shelf in your study.
- Hag!
- Queen!
I'm sorry I always make you eat breakfast at my house.
I'm sorry I got you involved with "A Course ln Miracles".
I'm sorry I took the batteries out of Mr. Good Vibrations and put them in my alarm clock.
That was you?
I'm sorry.
Most of all.
I'm sorry I made fun of you at the rental place.
You know a lot about cars and you're a very good driver.
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.
So just.
you know.
remember that - the next time-- - Grace.
no!
Sorry.
- Hag.
- Queen.
Oh.
darn.
I spilled all over my sweater.
- No.
you didn't.
- No.
I didn't.
but I made you look.
So.
Jack.
what do you think?
Good?
Mmm.
I've had better.
Jack.
you cleaned your plate with your tongue.
Okay.
fine.
I liked it.
all right?
It was fabulous.
You're a fabulous cook.
You know everything about everything.
But can you do this.
hmm?
All right.
can you do this.
hmm?
All right.
that's it!
I've had just about enough!
I can't take any more of this.
because you have shamed me here today.
And now it is my turn to shame you.
Now.
there is one thing I know-- I know I can do better than you.
Really?
What's that?
Tap dance.
- You think so.
huh?
- Oh, yeah.
I must warn you.
I've studied with Tony Wing.
the Chinese Fred Astaire.
Prepare to be amazed.
Karen.
count me off.
please.
Five.
six.
seven.
eight.
Jack.
wow.
I mean.
you have it all over me.
- I fold.
- Wise man.
Now.
if you'll excuse me.
I have to go to the little girl's room.
- What?
- Are you kidding.
honey?
Five.
six.
seven.
eight!
What are you two toasting about?
Your victory.
honey.
- Oh.
thank you.
- Jack.
Look.
Ben.
don't be so hard on yourself.
okay?
It took me years to get that good.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Okay.
What do you think of them?
Oh.
I knew you'd hate 'em.
God.
it's just a stupid invention.
What made me think that a little pillow that cups and cushions the ass against the ravages of subway travel would be a good idea?
I like the name "The Subway Tush".
And there's the icky face.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
I knew you were gonna think it's stupid.
I'm so humiliated.
- What is he doing-- - Wait for it.
At least have the decency to sit on it.
I think you'll find yourself saying.
"Did my heinie die and go to heaven"?
Ooh.
Oh my God.
This feels really good.
Oh.
my tush is loving the cush of "The Tush".
Yeah.
it's squishy.
It's comfy.
It's oddly exciting.
Overall.
I'd have to say.
it's the butt's meow.
Shut up!
Oh my God.
you really like it?
I knew you would!
Now.
there's just one teensy little thing.
I need $50.000 for start-up costs.
Well sure.
Jack.
Do you want me to write you a check or shall I pay you in cheese?
I can take a check.
Hey.
zippy.
I'm not giving you any money.
Selfish!
You believe that guy.
soaking me for 50 large?
Forget about it.
Okay.
First of all.
you've just officially been cut off from "The Sopranos".
And second.
how could you just dismiss him like that?
- What are you talking about?
- Look.
it is hard for him.
I work all day.
you work all day.
He comes home at 3:00 to an empty house.
I worry about him.
Sooner or later.
the boy's gotta learn that life is not easy!
Uh.
I guess you're right.
Our little girl is growing up.
Grace: So, once again, I just wanna say thank you.
Honey.
quit thanking me.
You sound just like Stan after-- just after.
No.
no.
Really.
really.
I never would've gotten a meeting with Robert Lilienfield if you hadn't made the call.
Come on.
Grace.
you could've gotten it on your own.
You get it?
No way.
Oh.
drink your lunch.
Oh my God!
- Look who it is.
- Honey.
I don't look.
I'm looked at.
- Who is it?
- It's Helena Barnes.
She's like-- Iike the best interior designer working today!
She-- Iook at her!
Look at her!
No!
No!
Don't look.
She'll see you looking.
Okay!
She's looking away.
Go look.
Iook.
Iook.
Oh.
good Lord love a duck!
Hey.
Hel.
put the caboose in motion.
Somebody wants to meet you!
Come on!
Oh my God.
Hi.
I am Grace Adler.
- and it is such an honor-- - Karen.
I was convinced that nasty smell was coming from the kitchen.
No.
honey.
I think you just caught a whiff of your own liver rotting.
Listen.
I want you to meet Grace Adler.
She-- she thinks you're really something special.
but then again.
she's never seen you face down in a pool of your own sick.
She hasn't.
- Grace.
enchanted to meet you.
- Oh.
hi.
The honor-- the honor is mine.
I mean.
I would curtsy.
if it weren't weird.
Oh my God.
I'm like one of those losers.
when they meet William Shatner at a Trekkie convention.
- Oh.
you are adorable!
- Thank you!
Oh!
Hi!
Who is this?
- This is Paxil.
- Oh And she asks that you don't touch her.
Oh.
well.
whatever little Paxil-waxil wants-- Nor speak to her.
- You know.
Hel.
Grace is a designer.
- Helena: Oh.
She's great.
She's better than you.
I'm sure she is.
Well.
Karen.
I'd love to sit and watch you suck your stomach in for the next 20 minutes.
but I really do have to go.
I've got such a busy week.
Between the Sandler's beach house and Pierre's new restaurant and an interview with Robert Lilienfield.
- I simply don't have a moment.
- Robert Lilienfield?
Yes.
Can you believe that he wants to put me through the formality of an interview.
before he hires me?
Why is it that men are only interested in foreplay when it comes to business?
Grace.
charmed.
Karen.
appalled.
Hel.
honey.
Iove you like a cold sore.
Ah.
she's sweet.
Okay where's the waiter?
- I want to start celebrating.
- There's nothing to celebrate.
I'm canceling the meeting with Lilienfield.
- What?
Honey.
why?
- Because I'm not gonna get the job.
I mean.
it's-- it's Helena Barnes.
and I'm Grace Adler.
I mean.
she's an international design goddess!
And I'm Grace Adler.
Come on.
do you really think that?
You really think she's better than you?
I can't afford Louis Vuitton.
and her dog poops in it.
All right.
I shouldn't do this.
but come on.
I'm gonna take you somewhere that's gonna make you feel a whole lot better about yourself.
Oh.
Karen.
I don't wanna go to the pharmacy for another one of your test drives.
Come on.
not there!
Move it.
move it!
Make it sing!
Get it!
Oh my God.
Will.
We are gonna make so much money.
I'm already eyeing a manse in the Hamptons.
It's three manses down from the Puffy-Lopezes.
Hmm it's been a while since you've had three manses in the Hamptons.
You do realize this is just a meeting with investors.
There's no guarantee they're gonna come through with the money.
although I must say.
they'd be crazy if they don't.
What?
Do you have to go sissy again?
You believing in me being my business partner.
- Who's my hero?
- Oh!
Who's my hero?
You are the wind beneath my tush.
Well.
Iet's not delve into that one too deeply.
Now.
I thought we'd start by you talking - about how you first came up with-- - No.
no.
no.
You do the talking.
That's what you're good at.
See.
you're the quarterback.
I'm just the slutty cheerleader with the nice rack.
All right.
Well.
if you feel like chiming in-- No.
no.
no.
I won't.
- Will.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- Bob.
always a pleasure.
- This is my partner.
Jack McFarland.
- Hello.
Jack.
Well.
everybody take a seat.
I think we're ready to start.
- Gentlemen-- - Introducing the Subway Tush!
- Jack!
- Hey.
mon frère lf your derrière could use a little cush No need to pout.
the word is out It's Jack's Subway Tush!
Taco Time?
What are we doing at Taco Time?
And-- wait.
did you bring that drink from the restaurant?
What is this.
Vegas?
- Look.
Karen-- - Hey.
forget it.
Red!
Don't call me by my real name.
Call me by my alias.
"Anastasia Beaverhausen".
I wanna be incognito.
Why?
Who could possibly know you here?
I don't know.
Hmm.
the Duchess of York.
What?
Why would the Duch-- oh my God.
it's Fergie!
Do you think that Weight Watchers knows about this?
What is going on here?
Taco Time is a guilty pleasure for some of the ladies in my circle.
Nobody questions it.
Nobody talks about it.
Okay.
but why are we here?
Come on.
Grace.
It's like it says in the Bible: "The best way to make you feel good is to make someone else look bad".
And nothing looks worse than a socialite shoveling a couple of Taco Gigantes down her gullet.
- Are you trying to tell me that Hel-- - Over there.
honey.
The slob in the dark glasses.
Are you sure that's her?
Paxil.
if you are not going to finish that.
Mummy will.
All right?
Very well.
then.
It's mine!
When is she gonna come up for air?
And she's-- I mean.
my God!
Oh.
Anastasia.
this is the best gift you've ever given me!
Don't kid yourself.
honey.
I didn't do it for you.
Helena took our slip at the yacht club.
and drilling a hole in the bottom of her boat just didn't turn my crank the way I thought it would.
It is amazing how long Rosario can stay underwater though.
Thanks.
Iadies!
You've been a great crowd!
Love ya!
Love ya like lovin'!
- Nice.
Nice work.
- Really?
Yeah.
Rip Taylor would've been proud.
Uh.
Jack.
can I speak with you for a moment?
Sure.
- Have a seat.
- Oh.
First of all.
I just wanna tell you that we really love your product and we're prepared to back you 100%.
Oh my God!
You wanna put everything you've got into my Tush?
Well.
that's not the way legal would put it.
but yes.
This is great!
Oh my God.
I can't wait to tell Will!
Oh.
yeah.
about that.
We want him out.
Oh.
he is.
Everybody knows.
No.
I mean "out" as in "out".
What?
It's just that your presentation was so dynamic.
but then Will kept interrupting to talk about thinking small and slow growth.
that's not the direction we wanna take.
We'd like him gone.
So.
what are you saying?
You expect me to sell out my business partner and best friend of 13 years for a scrap of foam rubber and a few measly shekels?
How dare you.
sir?
How dare you?
This is what we are prepared to offer.
He'll be gone by tomorrow.
- Hey.
Will.
- Hello.
Jack.
- Whatcha reading?
- A book.
- Would I like it?
- No.
there's nothing to color in.
Look.
I spoke to the investors after you left today And?
And there's something I should tell you.
- Sit down.
- I am sitting down.
Okay.
you don't have to bite my head off!
They said.
um they said they need to think about it.
They need to think about it.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Let me explain what that means.
That means "no".
And do you know why they're saying no.
Jack?
Because of you.
- Will.
I don't think-- - Exactly!
You don't think!
I mean.
first you start with that ridiculous song-and-dance number.
with Hey.
mon frère, with your derrière Could use a little-- thpp.
What the hell is that?
!
- You said to chime in.
- Yes.
but by "chime" I did not mean "The Bell of Saint Mary".
- Will.
Listen-- - No.
then-- then you bend over in front of Lawrence Weber.
a grandfather of four and a large contributor to the Republican National Committee.
and ask him to squeeze your happy heinie!
Hey.
I got a vibe from him.
but that's a whole 'nother story.
And to top it all off.
you produce this-- this sad.
obscene thing.
this butt puppet.
Buttford happens to be our spokes-puppet.
You stole Grace's pantyhose.
drew a face on them.
and then addressed people with it.
They were laughing.
You turned a meeting with my colleagues into Circus-O-Gay!
All of this adds up to the fact that we're not gonna get any financing.
because people do not generally give large sums of money to crass.
juvenile performing monkeys!
Then how come they want me and not you?
Because l-- what?
Yeah.
that's right.
They said you think too small.
They want you out.
They liked my vision.
they liked my energy.
they liked my passion.
And they liked Buttford!
They sent me here to fire you.
So now who's the monkey.
huh?
Hi.
I need some advice.
Did you just walk across the hall like that?
No.
Actually.
I put my bra on when I got to the door.
'cause I know how my girly parts embarrass you.
I can handle it.
I watch "Animal Planet".
Okay.
I need help here.
I've got my meeting with Lilienfield this afternoon.
So do I go smarty turtleneck.
hmm?
Or bold cleavage blouse?
- Well.
they're both fine.
- Fine?
I don't know.
Whichever one you like better.
What?
!
Will.
what is the point of having a gay best friend.
if you're not gonna dress me?
What's wrong with you?
It's just this whole Subway Tush thing.
I didn't even want to get involved in the first place.
as you may recall.
I was trying to be a good friend.
so I went to all the trouble of setting up all these meetings with these investors.
and the whole thing blows up in my face.
I just-- Jack sold me out.
I'll tell you that.
Will.
I-- I think he's more than made it up to you.
- What?
How?
- He's resigning.
- He's what?
!
- Yeah.
I spoke to him this morning.
I called him.
'cause-- I know this sounds crazy.
but I was missing all these pantyhose.
and I thought he might've taken them.
I was wrong.
But anyway.
that's-- that's what he told me.
He's resigning?
I don't-- why would he do that?
He said because he loves you and he's your friend and he doesn't wanna do it without you.
In fact.
I think he's doing it right now.
Oh.
my God.
I-- he-- he can't do that.
I love that he wants to.
but his Tush means everything to him.
- I can't let this happen.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
wait!
Hey.
hey!
- What about me?
- Oh this with this.
change the lipstick.
hair up and here are your hose.
So without Will.
you guys don't get Jack.
- In conclusion.
gentlemen.
I resign.
- Stop saying that.
You cannot resign from a project you've already been forcibly removed from.
You stole this idea.
Look.
when you say it like that.
of course it's gonna sound bad.
You told us you had a patent on this product.
when in fact.
the idea of the Subway Tush belongs to a Mr. Bjorn Stevenson.
Hey.
he said he was moving back to Sweden.
Then again.
he also said he could bench-press my weight.
which led to a very painful breakup.
I don't think you understand.
We're seriously considering legal action.
I know you are.
but what am l?
Gentlemen.
please stop.
Hey!
I know what's going on here and I'm not gonna let it happen.
I urge you.
do not to accept this man's resignation.
- He's only doing it out of love for me.
- Will-- No.
don't.
Please.
Jack.
Iet me say this.
When you have the opportunity to go into business with someone like Jack.
you don't let that slip through your fingers.
- Will.
Iisten-- - Jack has passion.
He has vision and most of all Jack has originality.
There is not an idea in this man's head that is not fresh.
unique-- - Shut up.
Will.
I stole the idea.
- What?
Apparently.
the Subway Tush is not his idea.
It belongs to what I've ascertained is an ex-lover of Swedish extraction.
You stole this from Bjorn?
- What about edible bike shorts?
- Jack.
Come on.
10 miles into the ride.
you get hungry.
there's a snack right there on your leg!
- All right.
How we doing.
honey?
- I'm good.
My pantyhose have a smiley face on 'em.
but I'm ready to go.
Terrif.
Now listen.
She's gonna come in here and act all superior.
- but don't you let her intimidate you.
- I won't.
Good girl.
Now.
I'm gonna go look at an island.
but remember if you start thinking Helena is something special.
just picture that albino rat of hers licking molé sauce off her mug.
Got it?
Got it.
Thank you.
I'm ready.
- Medusa!
- Medea.
Well hello.
again.
I must say I'm surprised to see you here.
Well.
I'm up for the job as well.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.
Well.
may the best designer win.
- Ha!
Not if I have anything to say about it.
You're a strange girl.
aren't you?
Why do the British always insult you and then ask you to agree with them?
Maybe because we think that you Americans are just a little bit silly.
don't you think?
- Helena!
Hello.
- Robert.
How are you?
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
I guess I was just saving the best for last.
Oh.
Robert.
stop.
- So what have you been up to?
- Oh.
what haven't I been up to?
Beijing.
Bora Bora.
Budapest-- oh.
by the way.
Curtis and Denise send their love.
They thought the Steuben menorah was fabulous!
And I must say I agree.
Oh, Helena, you always say the right thing.
And you must be Grace Adler?
Did you have any trouble finding the place?
She eats tacos!
Lots of tacos!
Big.
honking.
greasy ones with extra cheese and guac.
and they drip on her fancy clothes.
She thinks no one knows.
but--  Oh.
they know.
all right!
Yeah!
Miss Snooty Pants is a taco eater!
So now who do you wanna hire?
Well.
I don't know.
Let me see your book.
Book?
Listen.
honey.
I know you're feeling a little down about what happened.
- but.
hey.
Iook on the bright side.
- What bright side?
Well.
It's just an expression.
honey!
I can't believe it.
I made a fool of myself.
I forgot my book.
I blew a job.
My God.
this is the best freaking taco I've ever had.
Grace.
darling.
that was a delicious performance you gave today.
So delicious in fact.
that I've decided to pick up your tab.
Thanks.
especially since it was Iike $2.50 for the both of us.
- Anastasia.
- Endora.
Hey.
mon frère.
if your derrière Could use a little cush - No need to pout - The word is out It's Jack's Subway Tush!
I really mean it It's Jack's Subway Tush!
I'll tell ya.
Daddy It's Jack's Subway Tush!
Get out.
- For real?
-  Yeah.
get out.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Melanie Weaver is getting married?
I went to college with her.
What does it mean when lesbians are getting married before me?
- Look at that.
I'm five for five.
- What's that?
It's this test.
the five pillars of happiness.
Supposed to determine the level of contentment in your life.
And it comes with a lotion sample.
so you know it's scientific.
I can't believe you would evaluate your life based on something in the Lifestyle section.
Okay.
that was obligatory.
Bring it on.
The first pillar is health.
I gave myself a big yes.
'cause I just had my physical.
Everything's where it's supposed to be.
I'm running every day.
and well.
Iook at those calves.
It's like my knees swallowed a grapefruit.
Your turn.
I think I'm hypoglycemic.
I'm always tired and I can't poop.
I would give that a "no".
Okay.
pillar number two is family.
- That's a big yes.
You?
- Well.
Let's see.
My mother's idea of bonding is making me scratch her back.
and for my last birthday.
my father gave me gum.
That's another "no" for Grace.
Moving on.
Iove life.
- Another "no" for Grace.
- Excuse me!
No.
you can mark that "yes".
thank you.
Josh and I are doing great.
I mean.
it's not perfect.
but we care about each other very much.
Grace?
Hey.
what are you doing?
You left an hour ago to get bagels.
Here.
Toast 'em up.
I'll be back in 15.
Okay.
honey.
Uh.
your laundry is almost done.
Well.
you get a "no" on love life.
too.
Actually.
I haven't told you this yet.
but there's this lawyer.
Alex.
We've only had one date.
but I'm already seeing and his-and-his SUVs in my future.
Yeah.
yeah.
okay.
Next.
Okay.
pillar number four.
friendships.
- Okay.
now we're talking.
- No.
no.
no.
no.
Note the "s".
Friendships.
They're talking more than just you and me.
This test sucks.
And the final pillar is work.
I love my job.
I work with a lush who insults me.
Okay.
final tally is Will.
Dee-de-de-lee-dee-dee Grace.
Waa-waa-waa.
You're not that happy.
I've known you a very long time.
There's always something bugging you.
Come on.
think hard.
- What is rotten in your life?
- I don't know.
My life is-- okay.
actually.
there is something.
I don't like how you've stopped having lunch with me at my office.
You know why that is.
I hate the view.
Really?
I thought it was because you hated Ben.
That's what I meant.
the view of Ben.
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
We'll have him over.
I'll make dinner.
and all you have to make is nice.
Think you can do that?
- I can make nice.
- All right.
I'm always nice.
- Sweetie.
the bagels are ready.
- Call me when they're cream-cheesed.
- Love you.
- Uh-huh.
And Cook.
Iisten.
tell Butler to tell Gardener to stay out of my kitchen If he wants a snack he can root around the terrace for grubs and berries like the rest of the help.
Now get back to work.
Hey Care Bear.
Something's bothering me.
Can we talk?
Sure.
honey.
Hey.
are you wearing make-up?
Nothing.
really.
just a little man-tan.
- Your eyelashes look good.
too.
- Thanks.
I'm wearing individuals.
I'm concerned.
Um does Rosario seem different to you?
Come to think of it.
she sent me to work today with a juice box.
I guess that means Mason went to school with a thermos full of Stoli.
She's distant.
she's distracted.
She's getting a little handsy in her sleep.
Last night.
she rolled over and shook hands with Master Harold and the Boys.
And let me tell you.
they were not amused.
I know.
honey.
but listen.
it's been my experience that when problems arise between husband and wife.
one should never point the finger of blame because it's always the husband's fault.
I know what it is.
Doilet-toilet.
I forgot our anniversary.
How insensitive of me.
This is my wife.
my significant otra.
That's good.
honey.
Why don't you just run home right now and tell her how much she means to you?
I would.
but I have a date with Fernando.
Oh.
Well.
then.
why don't you pick up a little something.
and bring it to her tonight?
Something she'd love.
Iike pork or Tinactin.
No.
not that.
It has to be a more meaningful gift.
I don't know.
what's the traditional first anniversary gift?
Ooh.
well.
Iet me try to remember.
For my first anniversary.
I got a million dollars in cash.
Paper.
it's paper!
Paper?
Paper is so blah.
Let me tell you.
when the gays can get married.
that's the first thing that goes.
So we're at this dim sum restaurant downtown.
- and they have this thing called bao-- - Yes.
I know what bao is.
I spent the summer at the Culinary lnstitute in Hong Kong.
Personally.
I prefer har gow.
- Okay.
not the point of the story.
- Will: Anyway so she decides to have some fun with the waiter.
so she says.
"What are these white puffy things"?
And he says "Bao".
So.
I do.
- "Okay.
but what are they called"?
- Bao.
- "Okay.
but what are they called"?
- Bao!
She did it like five or six times.
It was a very funny story.
I guess the humor was derived from two things: One, that the two words sounded the same; two.
that you made fun of someone who doesn't speak English very well.
Funny people think it's funny.
Really?
How would you know?
You know what.
Benjamin?
What do you want me to say.
bow wow?
All right.
all right.
all right.
all right.
all right.
all right.
Don't make me turn this car around or we're going home without ice cream!
Hello.
Hi.
Alex.
I was just thinking about you.
Okay.
I wasn't.
but I certainly am now.
Let me take this outside.
- It bugs you.
doesn't it?
- What?
When you're not the center of attention?
It kills you.
I can tell.
- You think so?
- Mmm.
I know you.
Ben.
You're so focused on yourself and your whole Ben Doucette thing.
But do you ever think of anyone else?
Have you ever stopped to ask someone else what's up?
What's up.
Grace?
No.
I don't think so.
that's not gonna work with me.
We're talking about you.
All right.
fine.
What do you want to know?
How about something real?
Something that doesn't involve the words "Porsche".
"beach house" or "what's-her-name"?
Mmm.
Okay.
something real.
Well.
I've been married twice-- first to the love of my life.
who died 10 years ago.
then to a woman who reminded me of my first wife.
but was.
I found out.
nothing like her.
I have two beautiful kids.
one who's crazy about me and one who's not.
And somehow.
driving my Porsche to my beach house with what's-her-name.
doesn't quite make up for the fact that the things I really want in my life are exactly what's missing from it.
Wow.
Is that true?
All but the Porsche part.
I drive a Mercedes now.
S-Class.
Any more questions.
Grace?
Um how's the lamb?
I made it.
you know?
It's really good.
Grace.
It's good.
Date number two is set.
The romance pillar is a little firmer-- Iet me rephrase that.
Uh-oh.
Grace.
you didn't tell the irregular pantyhose story.
did you?
There was something in the air tonight The stars were bright.
Fernando.
What?
You know what?
Who needs brains when you can lick your own eyebrows?
Why did you give the flowers to the womens?
You like the mens.
'Nando.
Poor naive 'Nando See Rosario married me to get a Green card.
But as long as I'm married to her I get a platinum card.
a Barney's card and a Hallmark card that says "Welcome to Easy Street".
So I gotta keep the little women happy.
Now let me just give these to my wife.
and then we'll go make out.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Cha Cha.
what are you doing home?
I thought you had a date with Dennis.
Not till 10:00.
Anyway.
Rosie.
um I know you're upset because I forgot our anniversary.
but I'm just hoping that this will make up for it.
Oh.
so sweet.
And since paper is the traditional first anniversary gift Oh.
Bounty.
Now I can cross it off my list.
Happy anniversary.
Rosebud.
Don't wait up.
Is it safe?
My husband's gone.
but I would not say that it is safe.
my little cup of crema de cacahuates.
Rosie.
can I have some cash-- Jennifer Love Hewitt!
What the hell is going on here?
!
What can I say.
chica?
The heart wants what it wants.
But you and Gardener?
We're in love.
We want to get married.
Well.
I guess it's clear.
I'm the only one in this relationship who values the sanctity of marriage.
Come on.
Fernando!
Mr. Zamir?
- Mr. Zamir!
- What?
What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
I was walking my dog.
- What dog?
- Uh.
where did he go?
Doggy.
doggy.
doggy.
Doggy.
doggy.
doggy.
You were hunched over.
reading a personal card to Grace.
I would never do something like that.
It is wrong.
I'm glad you realize that.
So.
she has slept with a guy with named Ben last night.
Let me see that.
Uh.
that's a filthy note.
but also tender and gentle in spots.
That Ben is a smooth operator.
Grace and Ben?
- Hey.
- Will.
what are you doing?
I was helping Mr. Zamir look for his dog.
I don't have a dog.
You and Ben?
Hey.
you're the one who wanted us to make nice.
We did.
We made nice.
Twice.
You are unbelievable.
You're the second guy to tell me that in the last 12 hours.
Come on.
Iaugh.
Grace.
he's my boss.
Obviously.
I didn't plan this thing with Ben.
It just happened.
It was just this wild chemical.
"ripping off of a pair of $50 panties" kind of thing.
Thank you.
Grace.
That'll go next to the visual of my grandmother getting out of the tub.
Don't make me feel bad about this.
Ben's a great guy.
Besides.
you have all five pillars of happiness.
Let me have this one.
But my boss?
I mean.
did you stop for one minute to-- you know what?
I'm not gonna do this.
This is your life.
your decision.
Enjoy it.
Oh.
Will.
the passive-aggressive gay man.
it's been done.
No.
no.
no.
no.
This is relaxed fit gay man.
I'm serious.
I'm making a whole new choice with this conversation.
See Ben.
Honestly.
it's fine.
All right.
I'm gonna take you at your word.
because I do want to keep seeing him.
Good.
Terrific.
have fun.
Just leave me out of it.
Last thing I need in my life right now is somebody else's drama.
My wife is cheating on me!
My life is ruined!
Will.
help me!
Enter the drama queen.
exit the neighbor.
Can you believe this?
She wants to divorce me and marry Gardener.
I'm out on the street!
That's shocking.
Is there any way you can tell me about this without screeching like a howler monkey?
You know what?
I don't need you!
I have plenty of friends who would be more than happy to help me through this!
Goodbye!
You don't even pretend to leave anymore.
do you?
This is serious.
Will.
I am about to lose everything.
and I have a dog and a bird to support.
Jack.
it was a sham marriage.
What are you going to do?
Take Karen to court and demand she keep you in the lifestyle to which you've become accustomed?
I'm not talking about-- I don't-- can I really do that?
Mr. Doucette said that you should review the Blumen file.
- Where is it?
- I don't know.
ask his assistant.
- You are his assistant.
- I just said I didn't know.
Wow.
is that your fun side?
I'm just asking.
'cause I wouldn't want to miss it.
-  - You should consider yourself lucky.
Why is that?
'Cause I get about $500 an hour for the work I do at this table.
That's it?
I wouldn't get out of bed for $500.
Really?
Will you take a check?
All right.
you either said something very romantic.
or you called me a prostitute.
- Whatever.
sounded good.
- Yeah.
How you doing.
Truman?
Hi.
Will.
What can I do for you?
Oh.
I was just looking for the Blumen file.
but hey.
Mr. Blumen can wait.
One more day in a Turkish prison never hurt anybody.
Okay.
okay.
I'll get it for you.
It's in my office.
- You want to cut in?
- Uh.
- No.
thank you.
I'd rather not.
- Aw.
come on.
cut in.
This lady's gotta dance.
See you later.
sweetheart.
You too.
Grace.
Oh.
please.
with the look.
How many times did I have to watch you and Michael do "Summer Loving" from "Grease"?
That wasn't a look.
I was just looking at your skirt.
Shouldn't you be on the dashboard of a cab.
going It's amazing.
you know.
when things are working in the relationship department.
all those other pillars just fall into place.
Me and my family are getting along.
- I'm loving my job again.
- Yeah.
what about your health?
Health's better too.
but that's not Ben.
that's bran.
Hello.
Karen.
Hello.
Grace.
I am here on business.
Oh.
great.
Put me down for two boxes of the Thin Mints.
Okay.
different business.
Damn.
now I want a cookie.
Okay.
I'll be back.
This is in regard to the very tragic and devastating collapse of my marriage to Rosario.
It's the laughter you'll remember.
honey.
Let's go buy make-up.
And even though one could never put a price on the pain and suffering this has caused me.
one has.
Jack.
I don't read.
I'm read to.
Very well.
Item one.
$500.000 paid to me by you over the next four years.
preferably in 50s.
Item two.
A Shetland pony dyed powder blue to match my eyes.
Item three.
powder blue eyes.
- Item four-- - Wait a minute.
wait a minute.
Blanche!
I'm still on item one.
Yeah.
I've always been turned on by one Benji Franklin.
He wasn't afraid to wear his hair up and away from the face.
Franklin's on the 100.
you mook.
And where do you get off asking me for 500K?
Do you know how many times I had to  "Oh my God.
Stan"!
to get that?
Well.
we did have a contract.
I gave you a year of my life so Rosario could stay in the country.
I don't think a trust fund and a Corvette is too much to ask for.
Are you kidding me with this?
I plucked you out of a 4x4 hovel above a blinking light in Times Square.
and I put you in a 6x6 maid's quarters on Park Avenue.
- and this is the thanks I get?
!
-  Hey.
you got something out of this too.
Missy.
Who read "Valley of the Dolls" to your kids every night?
Who distracted Stan for you on Oyster Tuesdays?
Me.
It was me.
Now I want my 500.000 in 50s!
You know.
you should think very carefully about what you're asking for.
Miss Gurley Brown.
You've got a good thing going here.
and if you think that you can just shamelessly siphon cash off a loved one Iike I'm doing with my husband.
you've got another thing comin'!
I want my money.
You ain't getting 88 cents from me.
Rose.
Very well.
I will see you in court.
By the way.
your boobs look great today.
It's a custom-made Jean Claus.
came in from Paris yesterday.
Get outta here!
And at that point.
the arbitrator will hear your side and Karen's side.
and then he'll render his decision.
But Jack.
you've got to be more reasonable in your demands.
You can't.
for instance ask for all of Karen's camisoles.
Why do you want them anyway?
For Halloween.
Me and 12 of my gym buddies want to go as an East Side brothel.
And you will never get this amount of money.
I know it was a little excessive.
but then just get me enough for the essentials.
okay?
Like food.
clothing and bikini waxes.
Well.
that was good.
That way we all win.
Hello.
Alex.
hi!
I'm so sorry about last night.
I couldn't get out-- Tomorrow brunch?
I will be there.
I will absolutely be there.
Okay, bye.
Jack.
he's straight and married.
Yeah.
so I am.
-  - Oh.
good.
Grace is here.
I'm gonna go tell her about Alex.
Oh.
you gotta go tell your wife about your boyfriend.
Spooky.
What?
When you said that.
you looked just like a woman.
Gracie.
good news-- oh.
you're not Gracie.
And this is not good news.
Hello.
Hey, it's Alex.
Where are you?
Ooh.
were we having brunch today?
I thought we were having brunch on your birthday.
Today is my birthday.
Ooh!
I've got to break some really bad news to a friend of mine.
Is there any way we could reschedule your birthday?
'Cause you seem more like a Libra to me anyway.
Okay, Will, why don't youjust tell me now?
You're actually a straight married man with three kids who has no intention ofdating me again.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Morning.
sweetie.
Oh my God.
is that bacon?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Alex I'll call you back tonight.
I'm so sorry.
What's going on?
Bacon.
pancakes.
You put a chocolate chip smiley face on them this would be the meal you make to cheer me up.
But I don't need cheering up.
Ask me Why.
Okay.
here's a hint.
Check the outfit.
You picked up a shift at Long John Silver?
I'm going yachting.
Yes.
that's right.
I yacht now.
But you're Jewish.
Hello?
Have you ever heard of a little boat called the Ark?
Did I mention that it's Ben's yacht?
- Now about Ben.
- Oh.
thanks I should Carbo load drinking Martinis and having sunscreen applied to your back really takes it out of you.
Remember when you first met Ben how you really.
really hated him?
Yeah.
now I really.
really like him.
You know what else I really.
really like?
Bacon.
Where you hiding it chief?
Remember how you said he was slick and slippery and you wouldn't trust him as far as you could throw The Commish?
I guess I was wrong.
Gosh Will.
it is so great to date a guy who's grown up.
Who's secure with who he is.
who isn't emotionally needy.
Who owns a big ass yacht.
I don't know.
you are a pretty good judge of people.
You hated Dr. Laura long before the rest of the world did.
- Okay.
taking these to go.
- What?
Why?
I'm not gonna let you do that thing where you chip away at a guy I'm dating.
I start to question and we break up and then I'm back to flirting with the manager at Blockbuster again.
I'm just trying to Just try to be happy for me okay.
that's what friends do.
Friends don'tjudge and friends don't criticize.
And most importantly friends do not let me leave the house Iooking like the little boy on the Cracker Jack box.
My God.
what the hell were you thinking?
Will.
I need to see you for a moment.
Great.
I need to see you too.
- Can I get you anything else?
- No thanks.
I'd like a Diet Coke.
no ice.
I'd like a date with Denzel.
but that's not gonna happen either.
Ben.
I'm in an awkward position here.
I know.
so I'm gonna make this easy for you.
This inappropriate behavior is gonna stop immediately before someone gets hurt.
Wow.
I couldn't agree more.
Good.
I'm glad we talked about this.
- Yeah.
so you'll stop.
- Why would I stop?
I'm not the one representing Jack against our client.
Karen Walker.
No.
you're the one who's cheating on Grace.
- Is that what we're talking about?
- Yeah.
Then why are we still holding hands?
Will.
I really don't see where this thing with Grace is any of your business.
Really?
Give me a second.
My boss plus my best friend divided by chippy on the table-- yeah.
that comes out to my business.
Check your math.
You work for my business.
A business which bills seven figures a year.
from Walker.
Inc. So if you're gonna be representing anybody.
you're gonna be representing them.
- No.
I'm not.
- Yes.
you are.
- No.
I'm not.
- Yes.
you are.
No.
I'm not!
You know.
it's kind of ironic.
between us.
and this is the way we argue.
- And yes.
you are!
- No.
no.
no!
Forget it.
You want to talk about conflict of interest.
that's one thing.
but I am not going down that road again where you pit me against one of my friends.
Will.
I hate to reopen an old discussion.
but yes.
you are!
So basically.
you're taking my two best friends.
screwing over one of them and telling me I have to screw over the other.
It's amazing.
all this screwing.
you'd think somebody would be happy.
Here's your problem.
Will.
You've let your personal life interfere with your business life.
Now.
I take some responsibility here.
After all.
I am schtupping your best friend.
But you have to set boundaries.
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
and I'm about to set a very big boundary.
I quit.
- No.
you don't.
- Oh.
yes.
I do.
Jack: There's something I need to tell you.
Mommy and Daddy.
well.
we've decided to live apart.
Now.
this doesn't mean we don't love you.
In fact.
it was because of you that we stayed together as long as we did.
But in this crazy.
mixed up world.
how long can a marriage between a Salvadoran maid and a West Village singer-actor-dancer-choreographer last?
It's not your fault.
okay?
It's not anyone's fault.
But.
Iet's face it.
Mommy's a whore.
Mommy cheated on Daddy and Mommy's going to hell.
Hey.
poodle.
What the hell are you doing here?
Isn't it enough you destroyed me in arbitration today?
You have to come and gloat over your victory?
Oh.
Jack.
I wouldn't do that.
You know I can't hide anything from you.
You've got nothing.
nothing!
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Iaugh.
Laugh at my pain.
but I'll be the one who laughs last.
- No.
you won't.
- No.
I won't.
Yeah.
but really.
is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
You could apologize.
Oh.
I don't want to set a precedent.
but.
Iisten.
I'll tell you what I will do.
On your way out.
Security Guard is gonna frisk you to make sure you didn't take any silverware.
Hateful!
I should haul you back to court for slander!
Karen.
Who let you in?
- Your butler.
- Huh.
you mean ex-butler.
Speaking of exes.
you know what's nice?
Being your ex-lawyer.
Yeah.
not having to kiss your ass and pretend you're interesting is gonna free up a lot of my time.
I might even learn a language.
Honey.
if you look inside this bag.
I'm giving you a little sign language right now.
- Hey.
Jack.
- Oh.
hey.
Will.
hi.
I just want to thank you so much for your fine work at arbitration today.
Yeah.
it was so nice.
Oh.
wait a minute.
That wasn't you.
That was the opposing counsel.
I'm sorry.
I just have a lot on my mind and my life is in a very weird place right now.
Well.
Boo Radley-hoo.
Iady.
My freaking world is collapsing.
Then why did you bring a date to your divorce hearing?
"I bored.
Yack.
Iet's go get a grape juith".
- 'Nando is my rock.
-  And when we're at a better place.
I have stuff to tell you.
It's like the man does not have hamstrings.
But back to the point.
I am out on the street and it's all your fault!
I'm sorry.
children.
I don't want you to see Daddy cry.
-  -  Jack.
I'm sorry.
How can I help?
What can I do?
Can two gay men share an apartment without driving each other crazy?
-  -  Probably not.
You know.
it's not the Four Seasons.
but since life has given me lemons.
I will drink your lemonade.
With crushed ice.
please.
Okay.
time to lay down a few ground rules.
Ooh, good idea.
First rule.
if the pad's rocking.
don't come a'knocking.
That's a good rule.
but I was thinking more like.
you take your bags and your menagerie.
Laura.
and take them into the back room.
and I won't smother you in your sleep.
Still waiting on that limonada.
Well.
while you're waiting.
just make sure that Claus doesn't make a urinada on the floor.
- I gotta go talk to Grace.
- Oh.
Will.
Iook.
quick thought.
The back bedroom's kinda small.
How about every six months we switch rooms?
Hey.
how about every two months.
you and the bird switch heads?
- Hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Is this too sexy for the symphony?
- Uh.
probably.
- Good.
Be a shame if the only overture I got tonight was from Gustav Mahler.
- Get it?
Classical humor.
- Yeah.
it was very good.
Somewhere.
Beverly Sills is chortling into her cleavage.
Look.
there was something I was trying to say yesterday.
and I didn't and I think I should say it now.
Sounds important.
It is.
so I'm just gonna say it.
I know you like Ben.
but he's not the guy you think he is.
Sweetie.
he's cheating on you.
He's seeing someone else.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You ready to go?
- Uh-huh.
You look beautiful.
I'm gonna find a vase and put these in some water.
Ooh.
Will.
I am getting a lot of stuff.
If you'd like.
Iater.
I can sit with you and teach you some calming pranayama.
- You were saying?
- Ben's seeing someone else.
which may not have quite the impact I thought it would a moment ago.
Oh.
yeah.
you mean that chick with the Macy Gray hair?
So.
you're okay with this?
Sure.
why wouldn't I be?
Well.
because he's seeing someone else!
And so am l. and so is Josh-- some girl with armpit hair.
named-- ugh.
what is it again?
Hon.
what's her name again?
Pond?
River?
- Ocean.
- Ocean.
God.
the guys I'm dating date such losers.
Okay.
who are you?
You're dating two guys.
and they are seeing other people.
This is not your life.
You're not gay or French.
I know.
isn't it great?
I'm naughty.
I'm dating two guys at the same time.
My mother would so not approve.
I can't wait to tell her.
Well.
that's-- that's great.
I-- I just quit my job over this.
but that's great.
- What?
- I quit my job!
Oh my God.
no!
No.
you can't!
Hey, we better get going.
My electric car only has Look.
this is just a huge misunderstanding.
I'll talk to Ben and I'll straighten the whole thing out.
Come on.
honey.
Tick-tock.
Okay.
we'll work this out.
You worry about me too much.
mister.
So.
you sound tall.
How tall are ya?
I don't know, six t-- is Will there?
Jack!
Alex.
I've not forgotten about our date.
I'm running a little bit behind.
but I will definitely-- Is that guy living with you?
- Yeah!
- No!
It's a long story.
You know what?
I think I'm done with your long stories.
In fact, l-- I think I'm done with you.
No.
no.
Alex.
come-- don't hang up.
Don't t-- Goodbye.
I blew it.
I'm sorry.
I know you're hurting.
buddy.
Thank God I'm here.
He sounded cute.
You think he'd like me?
Uh.
that was insensitive.
I'm sorry.
You probably need a couple hours to mourn.
Remember.
black is slimming.
Okay.
we plugged the car into a Chinese restaurant so I can give you five more minutes.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Let's ask the Lifestyle section.
huh?
Love life.
gone.
Job got in the way.
Job.
gone.
Friend got in the way.
Health.
something's in the way.
I may have to borrow some of that bran.
And friends Okay.
okay.
I get it.
And I'm so sorry 'cause I know a lot of this is my fault.
but-- but trust me.
I will make it better.
I don't think so.
I-- I don't think you can.
I think this is something I need to fix myself.
What are you talking about?
We don't fix ourselves.
That's not what we do.
I fix you.
you fix me.
So.
this is what we're gonna do.
Tomorrow.
it's all about Krispy Kremes.
blender drinks and more Krispy Kremes.
So.
by the time we're fighting over the last honey glaze.
everything will seem so much better.
No.
it won't.
I don't think a sugar buzz.
a morning drunk and a stomach ache is gonna do the trick this time.
I need a change.
I-- I need something different.
You always say that.
and you're always wrong.
Trust me.
I will take care of everything.
I got to go.
but everything is gonna be okay.
Right?
- Sure.
- Sure.
I'll see you later.
Sorry I'm late.
A horrible thing happened on the way from the donut place-- three and half of 'em disappeared.
Make that four.
What are you yammering about?
I wasn't yammering to you.
Erykah Ba-don't.
I was yammering to Will.
Well.
you're gonna have to yammer a whole lot louder.
Will's gone.
Left on a jet plane.
- What?
- Yeah.
she's exhausted.
Her life.
Iike her hair.
had become unmanageable.
- Where did he go?
- Uh, some island.
I couldn't really make it out.
I was in there watching the "Creek".
But-- but he-- no.
no.
No.
no.
he would never leave without telling me.
We didn't do the chicken dance so the plane wouldn't crash.
No.
he would never do that.
That would be totally unlike him.
Well.
maybe that's why he did it.
But he-- oh my God.
And since this is my apartment now.
we have a few new ground rules.
Rule number one.
if the pad's rocking.
don't come a knocking.
And rule number two.
the pad will always be rocking.
Okay?
Will's voice: Day one.
What have I done?
I quit myjob, I left my home, my friends.
I'm all alone in the middle ofnowhere.
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.
I kick ass.
This is fantastic.
And the best part is, no one can reach me, no one can bother me.
- Phone call.
Will Truman.
- What?
Hello?
Ben.
how did you-- never mind.
I-- No.
I am not coming back.
I quit.
Leave me alone.
Thank you.
Okay, people can reach me.
But still, this feeling ofremoteness is exhilarating.
I'm experiencing for the first time what it means to be completely alone.
And you know what?
I think I like it.
- It's rude to hang up on people.
- Ahh!
What the hell are you doing here?
I didn't hear Tattoo announce you.
- How did you find me?
- I'm me.
I can find people.
I hope you like piña coladas.
Me.
I like getting caught in the rain.
I don't care if you like making love at midnight.
I'm not coming back.
Coming back?
What makes you think I even want you back.
- You just said so on the phone.
- Hear me out.
We have a client who is in a bit of a dicey tax situation.
and-- - mm.
mm.
mm.
- What?
It's not for you.
It's for me.
He wants to start an offshore company.
- and this is as good a place as any.
- Forget it.
Come on.
it wouldn't even be like work.
Couple of hours a day.
the rest of the time you work on your tan.
write in your journal.
meet guys.
There's a place down the road called the Rasta Fairy lnn.
I'm assuming that's for you.
And the whole tab is paid for by me.
Ben.
forget it.
You're wasting your breath.
And by the way.
the Rasta Fairy lnn is not a gay bar.
It's a head shop.
I already checked.
Come on.
Truman.
what's it gonna take?
I know there's something out there I can give you.
- Come on.
name it.
- No.
- Ask for anything.
- No.
- Whatever it takes.
- No.
- Piss me off.
- Make me partner.
You're pissing me off now.
Truman.
Nobody makes partner after six months.
And I want that corner office.
the one that Steve has.
Kick him out.
He's homophobic and he smells like gin and Hai Karate.
I want my name on the letterhead.
prettier numbers on my paycheck.
and a no dancing policy on my conference table.
Where the hell do you get off asking for all this?
I know you.
Ben.
I know you'd never come down here unless you couldn't do this without me.
So.
the way I see it.
you've got two choices.
You can either give me what I want.
or you can take a plane home.
You know.
you can be a real jerk when you want to be.
Truman.
I knew I liked you.
Deal.
Oh.
one more thing.
when I get back.
when ever that may be.
I'd like Mrs. Freemen to treat me a little more politely.
Will.
there are limits to what I can do.
Have a nice vacation - I'll take that drink now.
- No.
you won't.
Yo!
Grace: Look at this.
Janet Eisenberg.
33.
and David Bromberg.
It is the second marriage for both.
Can you believe that?
Uh.
I really don't follow straight society.
Come on.
Jack.
it's Sunday morning.
We're supposed to go through the paper.
You comment on what I read.
and then I will comment on what you read.
Okay.
got a little bit of a problem here.
See.
you're trying to make me Will.
and I'm trying to make you disappear.
How about we compromise.
and you make me scrambled eggs?
Jack.
Iook where my foot is.
I could scramble a couple eggs from here.
Oh.
Grace.
I'm not like the other men in your life.
I will hit you.
Bring it on.
Nancy.
You don't scare me.
I'll pull your hair.
Do whatever you want.
'cause today I'm handing out lollipops and ass whoppings.
and I'm all out of lollipops.
- I miss Will.
- I do too.
I can't believe things were so bad that he had to leave.
I just hope he finds what he's looking for.
Do you think he left because of me?
Yes.
I do.
You know what.
Iets just Iets just try to be really supportive of one another okay.
Sure.
Is there anything you need from me right now?
No I'm okay.
Oh.
I guess I'm -- is there anything you need from me?
Yeah.
just your keys.
I don't really like you walking in and out all the time.
May I help you?
- Hello.
I'm Will Truman.
the attorney.
I have a 10:00 appointment.
The Mister is not feeling well.
We told him goat does not agree with everybody.
- But the Missus is right over there.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Well.
well.
well.
and they say fruit doesn't travel.
If anyone's hungry.
I made BLTs.
