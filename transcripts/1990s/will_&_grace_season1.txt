{START OF EPISODE 1}
- What are you doing?
- Hanging out.
- Come over.
- Will, I can't.
Come on, Grace.
You know you want to.
- Of course I want to, but-- - It's gonna be a good one.
- I can feel it.
- It's always good.
Still-- If you're not gonna come over, do you want me to talk you through it?
It's tempting, but I think I'll watch "ER" here.
Another night alone with my clicker.
Is that what the kids are calling it?
So I went back to the sale today.
- Did you get that black flowy thing?
- No, you were right.
It's too Stevie Nicks, the heavy years.
Eriq La Salle just smiled.
- Really?
- No.
- Did you buy anything?
- Yeah, I got a great camisole.
- Sexy?
- Man: I'm going to sleep.
Ask me in the morning.
- Was that Danny?
- Yeah, jealous?
Honey, I don't need your man.
I got George Clooney.
Sorry, babe, he doesn't bat for your team.
Well, he hasn't seen me pitch.
Okay.
Say, "Good night, Gracie".
Good night, Gracie.
It's to you, Jack.
Give me a minute, please?
Okay?
A room without windows A room without doors It's to you, Jack.
Give me a minute, please?
Wow!
A room where no guy but I can spy that No-ooo, not gonna risk it this time.
Four cards, please.
Here's my ace.
Jack, now that you're moving in, can I make one small request?
What's that?
Change everything about your personality.
I get it, comedy.
You didn't tell me Jack was moving in with you.
Not moving in, he's just staying until his apartment's finished.
-  - Oh, I know that one-- I know-- Did he need a stronger hand?
- Did he need a - Jack!
He's not humming your intro.
That's just a straight guy's way of thinking that you and I could ever be a couple.
Okay, first of all: Will should only be so lucky.
So let's just clear that right up.
Second of all: you don't even know me that well.
Why would you just assume that I was gay?
I finished.
Okay, FYl, folks, most people that meet me do not know that I am gay.
Jack, blind and deaf people know you're gay.
Dead people know you're gay.
- Do we play poker?
- Yes.
Come on, who's in?
I'm in for 10.
I'm fine.
Keep playing.
Oh look, it's Sporty Spice.
Did you and Danny have a fight?
Yeah, but I don't wanna talk about it right now.
- I can't even think straight.
- That's funny, neither can Jack.
Grace, did you know I was gay when you met me?
My dog knew.
So the fabrics never came in, and I wasn't able to make the presentation.
Diamond lnteriors got the job.
- I'm sorry.
What a disappointment.
- Thank you.
That's all I wanted to hear, but Danny said, "When you put everything off till the last minute" - Eew.
- Yeah.
And I lost it.
I started screaming, "Why can't you just let me have my feelings"?
Grace, that is so Barbara DeAngelis, "Making Love Work".
- I know, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
And then he says-- get this, "You don't have to get hysterical.
You sound just like your mother".
If you were on "Jerry Springer," that's the minute you'd jump out of your chair.
Can you believe that?
You're staying here tonight.
Go wash your face, I'll make up your bed.
"You sound just like your mother".
What kind of person says that?
The kind of person you should've dumped a year ago.
- What?
- I said, I hear they're re-releasing "Vertigo".
"You sound just like your mother".
When you wanna push someone's buttons, that'll do it.
Hey, roomie!
Jack, you can't move in tonight.
What?
Grace is very upset.
I told her she could stay here tonight.
- You move in tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, that's interesting.
You'd think maybe you could have told me this-- oh I don't know-- before I packed up my entire life!
You don't understand, Grace has had a really-- what's in the hat box?
Your tiara?
Look, Guapo, he made a funny.
Shut up, Will!
I just schlepped all the way over here from the East Side, and you know how much Guapo hates riding in taxis.
Okay.
Okay, take it easy, Jack.
You sound just like your mother.
Crossing the line.
You nasty, bitter, lonely, balding man.
I don't need this crap from you, Will.
You know what?
I just don't need it.
- What time tomorrow?
- Eightish.
Fine.
You're my lawyer.
You tell me.
What have I got to do to buy this company?
First, we've gotta get something called, the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust" clearance, and then we can negotiate standstills and lock ups, Naturally, that's after we do due diligence.
What the hell is "do-do diligence"?
No, Harlan, after we do due diligence.
Doesn't matter how slow you say it, it's still "do-do", isn't it?
- I just wanna know what it means.
- It's crap that lawyers deal with.
Harlan, I'll handle it.
I've been representing your corporation for five years now, remember?
I know, but my wife's been bugging me about the business.
She wants me to be a little more hands-on.
You sure she's talking about the business?
Yeah, she's talking about the business.
But I trust you, Will, so you do that "do-do" that you do so well.
-  - Woman: Will, it's Grace on line one.
Hey.
Can I stay at your apartment again tonight?
Of course, as long as you want.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for tissues.
Have your assistant get them for you.
- She's late again.
- Fire her already.
I'm not gonna fire Karen.
Her social contacts keep my business afloat.
Why does she even work?
Isn't she worth like a gazillion dollars?
She feels working keeps her down to earth.
I know, I'm late.
My driver had another bronchial incident.
It was disgusting.
I had to raise the partition.
But that's no excuse, I should be punished.
I'm writing you a check.
Karen, tell Grace she should fire you.
Grace, tell Will to redirect his anger at his mother, where it belongs.
- Call me later.
- Bye.
All right, honey.
There you go.
Guilt be gone.
Karen, I don't want a check.
I want assistance.
I'm the boss, I give you checks.
Yes you do, honey, and I love them, I do.
I keep them all right here in this box.
So, what else?
- Danny and I got into a fight.
- Oh, honey, call him and make up.
Why would I do that?
It wasn't my fault.
In the long run, it doesn't matter.
I don't know that there's gonna be a long run.
Grace, you're-- you're what?
40?
I'll be 31 next month.
So I rounded up.
Danny is a good catch.
You've been living together for a year.
Close the deal already.
I'm serious Grace, pick up the pace.
I'm serious, Karen, pick up the phone.
So, Will, have you seen Michael since you two broke up?
No, he hasn't, but I have.
Michael's not doing well.
He got fat, he's depressed.
Cheap haircuts, not good.
Actually, it's very sad.
What are you talking about?
I just saw him.
Looks great.
Rob, you're dismissed.
- Thanks for trying, sweetie.
- His haircut really was awful.
I know.
I think it's time for "$25,000 Pyramid".
- Rob: Hello!
- Woman: All right!
So, Will, are you gonna keep the place?
I thought it was gonna be a little too expensive, - so I told Jack-- oh no.
-  Hi, honey, I'm home.
- Are we entertaining?
Welcome.
- Jack, I meant to call you today-- - Don't even!
- Wait, wait.
I can stay at Rob and Ellen's tonight.
No, you can't, Grace, because apparently, you matter.
How about that?
Jack, I am so sorry.
I just-- Are bandanas back in?
'Cause I didn't get that memo.
Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Let me tell you something, Will Truman, I don't need to live here, all right?
And you know what?
Guess who loses?
Hello!
You do.
Because I could have turned you into a human being instead of this rude, self-absorbed, getting-chunkier-every-day-- oops, did that slip out?
--thing that you are.
- What time tomorrow?
- Eightish.
Fine.
Let's play "The Pyramid".
- Ellen: Okay, you two first.
- Okay, you give, I'll receive.
Just as God intended it.
- Ellen's timing.
- Got it.
Here's your first subject.
Go!
Okay, okay.
Driftwood.
John Wayne.
- You're parents' marriage.
- Things that are dead.
Yes.
My one-night stand on Fire lsland.
- Latin things.
- Good.
The postcard I sent you from ltaly.
"Everybody Hurts" by REM.
- Things that make you cry.
- Yes.
- Professor Gopnik's teeth.
- Things that are yellow.
Yes.
- A cane.
A railing.
- Come on, give me another clue.
Each other.
- Things that you lean on.
- That's it.
Yeah!
You guys-- that was amazing.
Grace, you and Danny never do this well when we play.
I know.
I'm gonna break up with him.
It's just time.
My relationship has reached a fork in the road, and ending it with Danny is the right-- prong.
Excuse me.
Things that bring a dinner party to a crashing halt?
- So, how'd it go?
- Not like I thought.
Gracie, I'm sorry.
You give it some time-- No, Will, he proposed.
- Grace Adler Design?
- Oh, my God, would you look at that?
Who in the world would be sending-- Oh, carnations, they must be for you.
Yep, they're from Danny.
Isn't he a sweetheart?
Oh my.
Well.
Surprised you're still walking.
Give me that.
He is so great.
I can't believe I ever doubted he was the one.
Bon appétit.
What am I gonna do about Grace?
What's the big deal?
Why don't you-- could I get a skotch more gravy?
It's a little dry.
If you don't like Danny, just tell her it's a bad idea.
I don't tell people who to marry.
Okay, you always tell me what you think of the men I date.
I'm talking about marriage, not Rudy the Jewish cowboy you met on the internet.
Shalom, my lonesome prairie dog.
She's your best friend, Will.
You have to tell her what you think.
- Be honest.
- I can't.
Before my brother married Ginny, he asked me what I honestly thought of her.
I told him, she's morose, and controlling, and icy.
They got married anyway.
Now she hates me and my brother and I don't talk.
I couldn't handle losing Grace like that.
I'm gonna call Rudy again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry, but more importantly, that's terrible about you and your brother.
It's awful.
No, no, no.
Do you have any mineral water?
Sulfites.
When are you moving in?
I'm gonna be away on business for a while and-- What business?
Business.
I have business, and clients and work-related-- business.
How is the work-related client business these days?
What is this?
Why do you have to be so mean?
Because you love it.
And I love you, and you love gel.
And you have a home here when you get back.
You can be a very great guy when you wanna be.
Well, I gotta be nicer to you.
- Yes, you do.
- Because you are a good friend.
- Yes, I am.
- I know it's gotta be rough on you.
- Will, don't.
- Being trapped in a man's body like that.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- What are you watching?
- "Pop-Up Video" Turns out, Fiona Apple doesn't particularly like apples.
Apple Brown Betty was invented by a guy named Darren, and get this, Bobby Darren's dog was named Fiona.
What are the odds of that?
- I said, "Yes".
- What?
I said, "Yes".
Oh my God.
Oh my God!
Come here!
Wow.
Let's have a look at that ring.
It's beautiful.
When is the stone being put in?
I knew you were gonna say that.
Wow You know, I'm thirsty.
What?
What?
What?
I'm happy for you.
Lying.
Lying man talking.
Grace, stop it.
I am happy for you.
I want you two to have a great life together.
You do?
Thank God.
I was so worried coming over here.
So I have your blessing then?
Yes.
- I love you.
- Love you.
Okay!
- I've gotta go tell my family.
- Grace, don't.
I have to, Will, they're paying.
No, I mean, don't marry Danny.
What?
Honey, I gotta be honest.
This guy's not enough for you.
You're passionate, and you're creative, and beautiful, and perfect, and this guy-- you should be with someone more-- somebody else.
He's not funny.
He doesn't know what your favorite flower is.
He's passive-aggressive.
The man high-five's you after sex.
You're so afraid you're never gonna get married you can't even see how wrong he is for you.
Think about it.
If you really believed he was the one, would you be asking me for my blessing?
Go to hell, Will.
No, Rosario, por favor, honey, listen to me for a second, okay?
Take Olivia and Mason to la store de los toys.
- Where's Grace?
- Oh, honey, thank God.
How do you say toy store in Spanish?
- Tienda de juguetes.
- Uh-huh, thanks.
F-A-O-yeah-Schwartzo.
Si, si, Rosario, gracias.
Hola.
I haven't slept.
I can't get any work done.
Where is she?
Will, just stop right there.
I cannot tell you anything, it's a secret.
- What is?
- She's at City Hall getting married.
Oh, devil.
What?
What about the big wedding?
She thought it was best to get it over with quickly, not to make a big to-do, and I say "Brava"!
- Grace-- - Oh, look who's here.
- I'm sorry.
- It's a little late for that.
No, I'm here, Grace.
I'm here to support your marriage.
- There is no marriage.
- What?
There is no marriage!
And you wanna know why?
Because my best friend-- that would be the part you're supposed to play-- my best friend dropped a bomb of poo on my head.
Oh, honey, l-- I was fine.
I was getting married, and then you come along.
You come and you poison-- with the-- with the thorns from the-- the flower-- I had this metaphor worked out earlier, but I'm just very upset right now.
Gracie, I just want you to be happy.
No, Will, you want me to be alone like you.
- Is that the way you see this?
- Yes.
It's interesting, because I never thought of myself as being alone.
Well that was a little harsh.
Good.
Yes, yes it is.
He's a bad person, very bad.
Grace, I think it's time for a couple of blue bippies.
- I don't want any pills.
- They're not for you, they're for me.
Marriage is-- what?
Marriage is-- marriage is.
Okay?
What the hell, that's all you need to-- Grace?
She's gone.
She's gone, and I'm sitting here talking to myself like a crazy person.
Oh my God, listen to me, I'm still doing it.
Will, I am-- I am so sorry for what I said back there.
I know.
It was mean, but-- I know.
This morning, on the way to the ceremony, Danny looked at me and said, "I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you".
And I turned to him and said, "You know the limo has a phone"?
It wasn't right.
He was a smart attractive man who loved me, and who I loved, by the way.
Why wasn't it right?
Sweetie, remember in college we saw that French film about a man and a woman that were perfect for one another, but they kept missing each other.
And in the last scene, they meet on a plane, because that's the way it was destined to be.
Remember?
And you said, "That's gonna be me".
Gracie, you're just in the middle of your movie.
Danny was a plot point.
A nice, decent, postcoital high-fiving plot point.
There's still time.
Go get some Raisinettes.
- I like Red Vines.
- Whatever you want.
The point is, it's not over if your movie's gonna have a happy ending.
- You just have to see it through.
- Oh God.
- Come here.
- Huh-uh.
What do you say we go get a drink?
Yes-ss.
- What is with that dress?
- Give me a break.
- I had five minutes to prepare for this.
- Still.
What are we to toast to your lovely new bride?
All: Yeah!
Here's to the ball and chain.
If she makes it through the night, ba-bing, I think I'll keep her.
Wait, my turn.
To my Will.
You are my hero, and my soul mate.
And I'm a better woman for loving you.
All: Oo-ooh!
Hey, hey, hey Come on, you two.
- How's about a kiss?
- All: Yeah!
All: Kiss, kiss, kiss - Nothing?
Anything?
- Sorry, no, it's--
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
And then Regis looked right into the camera, and said, "Just give her the damn Emmy already".
No, La Lucci, he didn't say "her," he said, "Give La Lucci the damn Emmy".
Right, right, right, La Lucci.
Do it.
Do Regis.
"Give La Lucci the damn Emmy already".
Now do Regis finding out he has a week to live.
Grace, no bad taste.
And I need some time to work on that one.
So you're seeing apartments today?
Do Regis after he's had too much melon.
- Stalling.
- Not stalling.
Grace, you haven't even been looking at apartments.
So not true.
Look, there's one now.
There's one and there's one.
Danny gets back to town in a week.
You need to move out of his apartment, and away from "ex-boyfriend land".
- I hate "ex-boyfriend land".
- So start fresh.
When Michael left me, I completely changed the whole apartment.
Will, your apartment is exactly the same.
The point is, you need a new place.
It's easy for you to say, Mr. Rent Control, Mr. View-of-the-Park, Mr. Perfect Apartment.
Oh my God.
Why don't I move in with you?
- Wow!
- Huh?
Can't, because I promised Jack he could stay with me.
Just till his floors are done.
Excuse me?
How brilliant is this?
I love you, you love me, and I love the fact I won't have to pretend I'm looking for apartments.
Okay, let me think about this.
No!
I love you, but no, no, Grace, we need to have our own apartments.
- Why?
- Because, we're grown-ups.
Aren't we?
What just happened?
We were having fun, we were playing Regis, and suddenly I'm supposed to grow up, get my own place, - and pay bills?
I hate you.
- No, you don't.
Look, I gotta get to work, and you have got to start looking for a new apartment.
Go.
Go, you big grown-up.
As Regis: "What do mean I only have a week to live?
What am I gonna tell Gelman"?
Ah-hh.
Oh, it all began with just one little dance But soon it ended up a big romance Blame it on the Bossa Nova The dance of love.
I made it myself.
It's a dry snack mix.
I call it "garlic jazz".
I think you might like it, but if you don't, Blame it on the Bossa Nova Knock it off.
Don't make me laugh.
You're bugging me.
Okay, how am I bugging you?
How about projectile "garlic jazz" all over my $4,000 sofa?
Each time you describe the sofa you add another thousand.
Must you always let that bird out of it's cage?
Hey, birds gotta fly, fish gotta swim.
Will's gotta lighten up.
Sorry, Jack, I didn't get much sleep.
You were on the phone till 4:00am.
I could hear you gushing three rooms away.
For your information, I was having a heart-to-heart call with someone who actually cares about me.
Nobody actually cares about you at Dial-a-Dude.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's $2.99 a minute.
And so not worth it.
Jack McFarland, you are a frustrating roommate.
You make expensive phone calls, but you don't pay the bills.
You eat a lot, but you never cook.
You put on a maid's uniform, but you never clean the house.
Okay, what is this?
What's with the vertical eyebrows?
- You and Grace get in a fight?
- No, we did not get in a fight.
She wants to move in.
And I said no.
And I might have been a little insensitive.
Do I have "garlic jazz" breath?
That's right, I forgot, it's always about you.
Why are you so angry?
Why don't you tell me what this is really about?
Oh my God.
You're in love with me, aren't you?
Do you smell toast?
Because I think you're having a stroke.
All I'm saying is, you're a realtor.
Let's get a little real.
Who can afford-- no, no, no don't hang up, please.
I'm sorry.
I'll have my assistant fax over the application.
It's gonna cost me a muffin basket.
Oh my God, I already have this.
Well, so now I have two.
I could live with my sister for a few months.
I could also shove bamboo under my fingernails.
Now this is something, "I got it so I'll have it.
And maybe I'll wear it, and maybe I won't".
But maybe I will.
Whoop!
Last month I had a fiance, and a two-bedroom apartment.
Next month, single and homeless.
Right on track.
Okay, now this is just fun.
It's "Beach, cocktails with the Pearlmanns, kicky little blouse, cheeriness".
Dick's gotta stop drinking.
Do you also hold up sandwiches in front of starving children?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm being insensitive.
I should really-- do you want a blouse?
No, thank you.
I want an apartment.
Can you please fax this application over to the realtor?
Oh, honey.
Machinery, no.
Why do you have to be the one to move out in the first place?
It's the break-up rule.
Whoever cancels the marriage is forced to wander the streets of New York without a place to plug in her hot rollers.
Honey, you know that Danny would take you back in a heartbeat.
I'm not gonna marry someone just because I want a nice apartment.
Yes, that would be wrong.
It would be settling.
- I wanna marry the one.
- And well you should, honey.
How else are you gonna get to the two and the three?
That's too much money to pay for any Ho.
Okay, here, charming one-bedroom, Chelsea adjacent, well-maintained, 1,500.
Sounds great.
Okay, let me decode.
Charming: tiny.
Chelsea adjacent: New Jersey.
Well-maintained: super washes blood off sidewalk daily.
You're not helping.
This is for you.
Okay, fine, fine.
Let me see.
Okay?
Oh my God.
Oh my God, here it is.
Perfect.
Upper West Side, spacious two-bedroom, - two-bath, fireplace - This is great.
hardwood floors, terrace, beautifully decorated by talented woman who hates looking for apartments, gay best friend included.
Ha-ha!
- Grace, you can't move in with me.
- Why not?
- Because, you know it's a bad idea.
- I don't know that, you know that.
I hate when people say, I know that.
How would I know that?
Let's go over the reasons why you shouldn't.
Reason #1 : you just got out of a relationship, and you need to wipe the slate clean.
Okay.
Reason #1 why I should: I would never let you walk out of the house with mustard on your face.
Come here.
No, no, no, eew.
Reason #2: the dry cleaner in your neighborhood calls me nice lady.
He calls me nice lady.
You need to build your own nest.
Living with me-- - I'd just become a crutch for you.
- So be my crutch.
You are so Markie Post in every single Lifetime movie.
Eew.
Grace, this is right.
You'll see, it's gonna be great for you.
How?
I'll be in a crappy apartment somewhere, alone, sitting around reading a human interest story about, I don't know, a kitty, with no hind legs, who pulls herself around on a cart.
Then I'll be sad, because I'm alone, and kind of wounded, and I'll identify with the kitty.
- I am that kitty.
- You are not that kitty!
Trust me, you're a big ol' calico.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I can do this.
- You can do this.
I should do this.
This could be the best thing I've ever done for myself.
Look at you.
Gettin' on, gettin' past.
Gettin' a little sick, what's in this thing?
Will, I'm scared.
Of course, you're scared.
You're supposed to be scared.
- I'm scared.
- You are?
Yeah, I just ate a hot dog from a vendor with three teeth.
I'm terrified.
Will: Sign here.
Initial here.
Put the pen here.
Shake my hand here.
As your attorney, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that you are now the largest manufacturer of buffalo feed in the entire Southwest.
Say it again!
You are now the largest manufacturer of buffalo feed in the entire Southwest.
It just sounds sexy, doesn't it?
- I'm hot.
- Yeah, let's go celebrate.
Harlin, can I take a rain check?
I am so tired.
Figuring out all those billable hours really wiped you out, did it?
No, just this guy who's living with me.
Look, Will, I know it's none of my business, but when my wife and I are having a problem, I light some candles, get out some nice aromatic oils, then rub it up-- it's just none of my business.
No, it's just a friend who's staying with me temporarily.
He keeps odd hours.
He's got the energy of a ferret.
He's messy, and he's got this enormous bird.
And by bird you mean-- Bird.
Just checking.
Woman: Will, it's Grace on line two.
- Hey.
- I found it, it's great.
- Come overnow.
- Where is it?
It's in Brooklyn Heights.
Get off at the Borough Hall stop.
- I'll meet you there.
- Wait this connection must be bad.
I could have sworn I heard you say Brooklyn.
What do you think?
- I think we're in Brooklyn.
- You hate it.
No, no I don't.
Who knew there were such nice apartments in Brooklyn?
I thought the only thing in Brooklyn were the Dodgers, and about 300,000 guys named Guido.
Will, the Dodgers left Brooklyn in 1958.
Sweetie, you know I don't follow the volleyball.
- Look at that tree.
- They really do grow in Brooklyn.
Grace, you have a new apartment!
I know!
- We need to do something.
- We need to play the game.
Yes!
What game?
The guess-where-all-my- stuff's-gonna-go game.
- I just made it up.
- Oh, excellent game.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
I'm up against the wall with a southern exposure that gets all the light during the day.
What am l?
You're the ficus.
Yes.
Good.
Moving on.
I'm above the fireplace.
What am l?
You're the ugly piece of string art you got in Santa Fe.
If you're not even going to challenge me, I can leave right now.
Okay, okay.
Captain's chair.
Come on, Grace.
Okay, okay.
I got one.
What am l?
I don't know what that is, but I am really embarrassed for you.
- I'm the humidifier.
- Oh, yeah.
One, yes!
Coming back!
- The lease?
- No, haven't done anything yet.
No, it's a two-year lease.
- And you've signed it.
- Okay.
I am old, and I once lived in Aunt Reba's house, and I'm not Uncle Joe.
Sweetie, I've gotta go.
I left Harlin back at the office, - and I gotta get back.
I'm sorry.
- Okay.
Call me.
I will.
I'm really happy for you.
I'm a coffee table!
Announcer: Tonight: comedian Sandra Bernhard; twelve-year-old pig caller Joni Marchinko; and Regis Philbin with Andy Richter and The Max Weinberg Seven.
Now, here's your host Conan O'Brien!
Jack, I'm sorry, but-- Morning, roomie.
Last night you missed it.
They had grizzly bear attacks on The Discovery Channel.
It was good, but I wanted better.
What did you break?
Can't a fella just make another fella a little meal?
You broke another wineglass, didn't you?
Welcome to Cynical lsland, population you.
I just think it's a little sad, Will, that you can't accept a simple act of kindness without turning it into something ugly and bitter.
Okay, Guapo pooped on one of your suits.
There, let the bile flow.
Jack, it's all right.
Excuse me?
It's a suit, I can get it dry cleaned.
That's true.
Since I'm going, do you need anything cleaned?
On me.
Where's Guapo?
What did you do with him?
Pretty bird?
Jack, Guapo's fine.
What?
Can't a fella dry clean another fella's-- I want you out.
I'm asking Grace to move in.
Oops, I did break another wineglass.
Jack, come-- you're leaving in a week anyway.
She belongs here.
I thought if she had her own place it would be good for her, but it's not good for me.
She's too much a part of my everyday life.
I can't have her all the way over in Brooklyn.
So you think you and Grace moving in together is the best thing - to do for the both of you?
- Yeah, I'm sure of it.
And I'm out?
No, no, that's very interesting.
- Now I know how your suit feels.
- Oh, Jack.
Come on!
It's not that big a deal.
You can stay at your mother's.
What is that?
Some type of sick joke?
All right, then maybe you can stay-- You know what?
I can take care of myself, thank you very much.
Don't worry about me.
I'm a survivor.
- So you'll be at your mother's?
- Yup!
Jack: Grace, Grace, where are you?
You're making a huge mistake.
Are you Karen?
Yes, honey.
Well, Peter, Paul, and Mary, you are fabulous.
Well, thank you.
- Who are you?
- I'm Jack.
Jack?
Oh, Will's Jack?
Well, hello, honey.
We've talked on the phone a million times.
I can't believe we've never met.
Look at you, you little hottie.
Stand up.
Oh, no, come on.
Look at you.
You are a rocket ship.
Oh, get out of here, you strange person.
This is-- what is this?
PS, loving the boobs.
Perky, with all kinds of attitude.
Store bought?
Huh-uh.
Right on.
God, I had no idea you would be so-- kitten-with-a-whip!
Come on, let's touch stomachs.
Oh, my Lord.
You are a complete freak.
So, honey, what are you doing here?
Why are you here?
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's that?
I borrowed this tassel from Grace two months ago, - and I never returned it.
- You borrowed one tassel, for what?
Let's just say a lamp.
Okay, come on, honey.
Stick around, talk to me.
I have nothing to do today.
Grace is taking the day off to move.
Not where you think.
- Shoes?
- Chanel.
- Fabulous.
- I know.
What are you telling me?
Will is asking her to move in with him.
Honey, no, no, she can't move into his place.
That's not acceptable.
Tell me about it, you feisty little Shih Tzu.
Oh, honey, how is she ever going to get married if she's playing house with a gay guy?
No offense.
Just guessing.
- Hey.
- Hi!
How did you get up without buzzing?
For three bucks you can get into any building on this block.
- Actually, this one only cost two.
- See?
I'm a bargain.
So, what do you think?
It's great.
I met one of your neighbors on the way in.
I'm sure he's a lot less threatening with his pants on.
Okay, got it, Will.
Brooklyn bad; Manhattan good.
Look.
Is this perfect here or what?
It's perfect.
It's also mine.
Oh my gosh, it is?
- It is.
- Keep it, you keep it.
Really?
Thanks.
I'm glad you're here.
Tell me where this mirror should go.
- How about here?
- Over.
- Over.
- Hello?
Arms.
Further, go on.
Eh, eh, eh - Will, I'm going out the door.
- Trust me.
Take it into the hallway.
Now get in the elevator, and go downstairs, and get in the cab that's gonna take you back to my apartment, 'cause I want you to move in with me.
Look at you.
Look at what you're doing.
This is the face of a man who's driving me crazy.
Why?
I thought you'd be happy.
I thought-- I'm talking to my-- Can we put this down, please?
We're born roommates.
What's the problem?
What's the problem?
The problem is it's too late.
I can't believe this.
What happened?
What happened to the whole you being a crutch thing?
Some people might call it a crutch, but-- what's a crutch?
It's support.
Support from someone who loves you.
Someone who has a terrace, which you don't, out here in Murderville.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Why are you doing this?
- You're too far away.
- Listen to me.
I packed boxes, I overpaid movers.
My mother's been here, and hates it.
I'm staying.
Grace, you just left the man you were gonna marry.
I just got out of a seven-year relationship.
Why should we go through that alone?
At the end of the day, I'd like to be with my best friend.
So would l, but I'm here.
I can't talk you out of this?
I'm a lawyer.
I'm very good at this sort of thing.
I know, you talked me into it.
I should sue myself.
Will, I've got to do this.
I have to have done this.
Be happy for me.
It's good that I have my own place.
Even if it is in Brooklyn.
Ya know what I'm talkin' about, ya big mook, with your 90-mile-an-hour hair?
Okay, I've done this.
- Goodnight, Will.
- Goodnight, Gracie.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
What you find Will!
feel, now What you know To be real Will!
Will!
Oo-ooh Your love's for real now You know that your love is my love I have a problem.
Sweetie, I was right in the middle of busting a move.
Could you come with me for a second?
But l-- Try busting a move in here, sweetie.
Come on.
Shake it, Puff Daddy - Okay, Grace, take it easy.
- I can't handle this anymore.
Look at the size of this place.
My hair doesn't even fit in here.
Open that cabinet.
I'd rather go for what's behind the curtain.
I'm afraid that's gonna be a zonk.
Can't you smile a little bit with a-- Okay, point taken.
I promise after work, we'll come up with a good solution.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
What are the double-D batteries for?
Oh, it's for my Waterpik.
You don't have a Waterpik.
Let's just say I do.
Jack: No, it's fine.
He knows me.
I don't need an appointment.
He's happy to see me.
No, don't buzz him.
Thanks, you're my new best friend.
Call me every 10 minutes.
What a bee-atch!
Jack, she's just doing her job.
I think that's the first time I've used the words "Jack" and "job" the same sentence without "needs to get a" in-between.
Speaking of which, how goes the employment search?
Take me to lunch.
Have you even decided what it is you want to do?
Still not sure, but I do know that on my resumé to be Helvetica.
I wonder how "chorus girl" will look in Helvetica.
Come back Thursday.
We'll do your resumé together.
Come on.
- Take me to lunch.
- I can't.
I've gotta finish marking up this contract, and then I want to get Grace some cool shelves, or something for her bathroom.
She hates it.
Of course, she hates it.
It's too small for her.
It's too small for Malibu Barbie.
Why don't you just share your bathroom?
My God, I think that's the first time you've used the words "Will" and "share" in the same sentence without "doesn't know how to" in-between.
What are you talking about?
You've had one common problem in all your relationships-- you.
- I'm good at relationships.
- Are ya?
Hm-mm.
Let's take a look at a little clip from when it was still the Michael and Will Show.
Before it was cancelled.
"Will, can I change your throw pillows"?
"No".
"Will, can I put my sweaters on your shelf?
.
" "No".
"Will, can anyone live with a control freak nightmare like you"?
I'm gonna say, no.
Are you ready for a bag full of happiness?
And I am not talking about your stoner days.
Okay.
I got this stuff at Bed, Bath & Beyond, and the crazy thing is it wasn't in bed or bath, I found it all in beyond.
Look, shelves.
This is your solution to my space problem?
You want to bring the walls in closer?
- Okay, bad idea.
- Uh-huh.
I can return.
I can return to the beyond.
- You want to hear my idea?
- Sure.
- It's very exciting.
- Tell me.
- It's very different.
- What is it?
- It's very big.
- It's very annoying.
- All right, sit down.
- Miss Grace, you play so rough.
I want to knock down the dividing wall between the two bathrooms, and make one, big, beautiful bathroom.
Oh?
Look at this.
This month, East Coast Living, Metropolitan Home, both showing the one big bathroom.
It's elegant, it's function with style, it's-- hold on a second, I'm getting overwhelmed by my own good taste.
Whoa!
Better, decorating rush.
What do you think?
No.
No?
No to elegant, no to style, no to me, what?
- I'm sorry.
I just-- - It's too much for you.
I knew it.
I wasn't thinking.
I was blinded by the faucets.
- Grace, l-- - No.
No, no, no It wasn't a good idea.
I should have known.
Michael couldn't even get you to change shampoo.
Let's do it.
Will, I wasn't saying that to guilt you into something.
You're not.
Saying no is a knee-jerk reaction, and I have got to stop doing that.
- Really?
- No.
See?
I can't help myself.
Yes, yes, yes.
And besides, it's you, and this is a really cool idea.
You don't even know, mister!
Silver nickel under counter sinks, handmade faucets, multiple showerheads.
There's even room for a chaise lounge.
I'm thinking washable suede.
Now you see, if you had led with the washable suede, I wouldn't have thought twice.
- So I can start?
- Do it, baby!
- This is very exciting!
- Okay, Grace.
Slow down now.
It's wrong to love a faucet this much.
You're right.
I don't want to fall too hard.
They tend to run a little hot and cold.
Go back to the singing.
Oh, honey, your skirt's hiking up.
- Hey, Kare?
- Yeah, honey?
Just FYl, the first three letters in assistant spell "ass," so please get off yours.
But I was just trying to tell you your control tops were showing.
Leave the skirt.
- Karen?
- Yeah?
- Why do you want to work for me?
- Honey, because I adore you, and because I always worked before I married money.
I joke.
Of course, I mean Stan.
I joke!
Of course, I mean money!
Karen, I have a great deal of affection for you, but you need to be a better assistant.
Put the catalogue down.
You have everything in it.
Come with me.
I'm gonna show you what I'm working on.
Okay?
Look at this.
This is a rough draft of what I'd like the bathroom to look like.
When I'm finished with this drawing, I'm gonna need it copied, and sent to a few people.
You mean like - the contractor?
- Yes, yes, yes, That is exactly right!
Oh my God, I feel like The Miracle Worker.
Good, Karen, good!
All right, honey.
Reel it in.
I get it.
Talk to me about this little doodle here.
This doodle is called a blueprint.
Whatever it is, honey, I love it.
Who's it for?
- Me and Will.
- You and W-- Woman, are you insane?
You can't share a bathroom with the person you're living with.
Honey, do you know where Stan's bathroom is?
God, I don't even know where Stan's bathroom is.
I'm not worried about it.
Our relationship is special.
Grace, I may never have had a special relationship with a man, but I have been married twice.
And I can tell you, this is a mistake.
Will and I want to do this.
This is a big step for him.
He's really open to it, and I'm proud of him.
And I'm proud of you for trying to be interested.
Well, thank you.
Hey, you know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be in before 11 :00.
Baby steps.
All right, 11 :30.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Do you have floss in your bathroom?
I'm out.
Sure.
Grace, don't be shy.
If you need floss-- - Hi, Will.
- Hey.
Huh?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Oh my God.
Oh.
Whole lotta tweezin' goin' on.
What, are you clear cutting?
Yes, I tweeze.
Get used to it.
You're gonna see me tweeze my eyebrows and I'm gonna see you tweeze the little hairs on the outside of your ear.
I don't have hairs on the outside of my-- ow!
What the hell?
!
I don't even know what to say to that!
Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't you need the sink?
- I can wait.
No, don't wait.
Let's just do what we normally do.
- Deal.
- Okay.
What you find What you feel, woo What you know To be real - What's the problem?
- Problem?
We're just like 50 men and a mirrored ball away from being a gay disco.
Oh, uh, Grace?
Sweetie, what's that?
That?
It's a hat.
I didn't have time to dry my hair.
So What are you saying, honey?
It's gonna stay on all day?
- Uh-huh.
- You know what?
I say we close.
You're obviously in no condition to work.
Stop.
Karen, how about some coffee?
Oh, no.
I had some on the way in.
Thanks.
Oh, you want some?
Oh, devil.
I need an assistant.
All right, where is it?
Never mind.
Oh my God.
I'm The Cat ln The Hat.
This bathroom is driving me crazy.
No, actually, Will is driving me crazy.
The bathroom is fine and I've got a doodle that proves it.
No, honey.
It's a blueprint.
Yeah.
You get a gold star.
You know what?
Will's gonna get through this.
I've gotta relax and ride it out.
It's like the storm before the calm.
You had to know this was gonna happen.
Men hate change.
Usually, you can't lump Will in with other men.
- He's-- - Oh, honey, come on.
Gay, straight, bi, Thai, they don't like change.
What is that, an Upper East Side haiku?
Grace, this is for his own good.
You are not a guest in that place, you're a roommate.
So start takin' up some room.
You hardly put a foot in the door.
It's time to take off those pumps, put on those espadrilles you're so fond of-- which, by the way, aren't coming back ever-- kick down that door, and let him get used to the fact that you live there!
God, that was exhausting.
I am assisting my ass off.
- Last job?
- Physical therapist.
You ran the man-tan booth at Le Spa.
It involved a lot of lifting.
Did I mention that Grace put all of our cereals into one big container?
Women, can't live with 'em.
End of sentence.
That's just wrong.
Right?
She should be caned.
Back to Jack, right here.
I was a Broadway usher for two grueling performances of "Les Mis".
What are you saying, it's me?
'Cause I'm-- there should be certain boundaries.
At least with breakfast grains.
Are we talking about my resumé or your problems?
I don't have any problems.
Ellen, honey, could you bring in Will's denial file?
I think we have a little something to add.
I am not in denial.
Come on, I don't have all day.
I'm meeting Harlin for drinks at my place, and I've got a lot to get done.
Next job.
Let's see.
What have I done?
What do I want to do?
What is the essence of Jack?
How does one put that into words?
Cater waiter, cologne spritzer, Gap.
Delete, delete, delete.
Oh, this is so difficult.
Ellen, honey, could you bring in a couple of diet colas and some of those blue pills?
Jack, get away from my stuff, and out of my space.
You know what?
Hold that thought until I get Grace on the phone, because I think you meant to bark that at her.
No, Jack, that was meant for you.
Grace and I are fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
You and Grace are falling into the same patterns as all your relationships.
You're a little time bomb ready to go off.
This is not about that!
This is about being late to meet Harlin, because you're wasting my time.
It is about being galled at your level of presumptuousness, and finally, ladies and ladies of the jury, this is about my total frustration over helping someone get a job whose main requirement is cute guys in the mailroom!
And so ends a scene from Mr. Bitch Goes To Washington.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Sweetie, Harlin's gonna be here any minute, so you should probably get dressed.
I am dressed.
You're gonna wear that?
How about, "Grace, you look like crap"?
- That's much more concise.
- No, you look fine.
I just thought you'd want to meet my biggest client in something more than underwear.
This is a good dress, Grandpa, but I'll change if it means that much to you.
No.
I mean, yes.
No, I do mean no.
Don't change.
You look-- you look beautiful.
Okay.
- What's this?
- What's what?
Well, I said get cheese.
There's no cheese here.
You see that stuff right there, that looks, and smells, and tastes like cheese?
- That's cheese.
- Well, yeah, but you can't just put out a few slices.
- You gotta have a whole wedge.
- Really, Will?
'Cause I just read "Cheese For Dummies" cover to cover, and they never mentioned the wedge.
You know what?
I'm sorry.
I'm a little anxious about Harlin coming here.
- It's-- - Forgiven.
Okay.
- What's this?
- What now?
The pillows?
I'm not really vibing on the whole Benihana Home Collection thing.
- That is gorgeous Chinese silk.
- Well, what's over here?
We got a new lamp and little baby goat heads.
What-- what-- what-- when did you decide to redecorate?
Will, I live here.
And if you're having a problem with the bathroom, you should just say it now.
Let me say this then, from now on, all pillows and food need to be cleared through me!
Whoa!
Okay, I don't want to do this right now.
- No, we're talking about this.
- Well, talk to the goat, - because I'm not doing this.
- Will!
- Don't shut me off.
- Click.
- Damn it, Will!
I'm not Michael.
-  Evenin'.
Harlin, right on time.
Come on in.
Beautiful place.
Oh, you must be Grace.
These are for you.
That's very sweet, Harlin.
Thank you.
Please.
- Will, where do these go?
- Anywhere you want.
Yeah, right.
Thanks.
I gotta tell you, it's awful nice of you folks to ask me up.
When I'm up here on business, I'm always in hotels.
Yeah, I've stayed at The Hyatt.
I've stayed at The Plaza.
I used to stay at this place in Midtown till I saw that thing on Dateline.
Maria Shriver showed up with one of those blue lights.
Iet's just say they were very unsanitary.
It was very nice meeting you.
Excuse me.
Will, are you sure you're gay?
'Cause this felt exactly like a night between me and the missus.
- Hi.
- Excuse me, I'm in here.
- We need to talk.
- I'm taking a bath.
Fine, then I'll leave.
Can I have a towel?
No.
Gracie, I don't-- I don't know if this gonna work out.
Fine.
Are you done?
I feel bad about this, but I think-- maybe we need to rethink this living situation.
- Bailing.
- I'm not bailing.
I just-- I have some issues I need to work through, and obviously, I need to work through them alone.
Bailing faster.
Why don't you just jump out of the boat completely?
I'm rigid, I'm passive-aggressive, - I'm controlling.
- News flash!
Will's controlling.
Yeah, got that freshman year of college when you told me what electives to take.
Funny, 13 years later and I'm still here.
So if you think I'm gonna let you bail out now over a bathroom-- It's not the bathroom.
It's me.
You're my best friend.
If I can't make this work with you, then what chance do I have of ever having another-- ever having another relationship?
You are putting way too much pressure on this.
How did we get from me having a place to plug in my hot rollers to the demise of all your future relationships?
When did you become such a drama queen?
I had problems with Michael, and clearly, I'm repeating that pattern-- Did you just call me a queen?
If the tiara fits.
I love you.
I hate this bathroom, but I love you.
Oh, honey.
This whole bathroom thing is so over.
- That wall is goin' back up.
- Yeah.
Loofa.
Or-- now, I'm no Grace Adler Designs, but what if we just moved the wall four feet, and then we'd have equal bathroom?
Look at you.
Mr. Compromising, Mr. Not-So-Controlling.
Don't do that!
Grace!
Oh my God!
You're naked!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Grace: Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
This is good.
- Basil.
- Mm-hmm.
- Garlic.
- Mm-hmm.
Ooh.
Not liking this.
- Coriander.
- Scary spice.
- Harlin's up again from Texas-- - Mm-hmm.
and guess what he did today?
Trapped a possum and ate it live?
Yes, actually.
I'm trying his recipe.
He bought an apartment on the Upper East Side, and guess what?
He needs a decorator.
Oh, and guess what?
It's you.
Will, no.
Huh-uh.
Why not?
Come on, he needs our help.
He's separating from his wife, and I think he's looking for a change.
Tell him to wear socks.
Beep, beep, beep!
Oh look, it's the money truck backing up.
Keep going, Grace doesn't want any, thank you.
Okay, you know what this would be?
Sophomore year in college.
You set me up with your TA.
And you wanted it to be perfect.
You told me what to say, what to order, what base I could go to.
- What base did you get to?
- Second.
Oh, come on, Will, he was a TA.
So, T but no A?
Hello!
Not the point.
The point is I know you.
You'll butt in.
- I won't.
- Oh, but sweetie, you will.
He's your biggest client.
I know you just want everyone to be happy, but you can't help yourself.
You've got a problem.
What?
It's a bad habit.
For God's sake, I can control myself.
Betty Ford set up a nice little place in the desert based on that very statement.
Grace, I won't butt in.
Grace, come on, do it.
It'll be a piece of cake.
- Oh, but-- - Harlin is a man of few words.
Here' show it'll go, "Howdy.
I love it.
Here's your check".
Why is this so important to you?
I'm a matchmaker.
I like to help people.
People-- - You already promised him.
- Yeah.
Oh, Will.
Okay, okay, Will, but here are the rules: this is between Harlin and me; you set it up, and you walk away.
You're just the pimp.
Great.
Now I've gotta get a big-ass hat, and shoes with live fish in the heels.
Ladies and gentlemen, Jack McFarland!
Jack, shut up!
Grace is asleep.
Well, wake her up!
I've got big news!
I was walking down the street the other day, and I got to thinking, what is it that I do best?
This is not a place for you to respond.
And then it came to me, clear as a bell.
"Jack, you have a special gift that you're not sharing--" also not a point of entry.
Okay, Jack, what is it?
What is the special gift?
Tell me before the anticipation builds to a terrifying frenzy.
You done?
Wait, wait, let me rephrase that.
Um, you're done.
The thing that I do best-- and I'm talking fast so you can't interrupt -- is sing.
- Sing?
- I have a beautiful singing voice.
Yes, you do.
Actually, it's beautiful.
So I've decided to take my career in a whole new direction.
Forward?
This guy, let me tell ya-- Thursday night, downtown at The Duplex.
Be there, be blown away.
What are you talking about?
You're not a performer.
I am now.
Me, a piano, and a spotlight.
I'm calling it "Just Jack"!
Here's my flyer.
Just Jack, one night only, Just Jack.
Why one night-- oh, it's open mic night.
Bring Grace.
Or a date.
I'm sorry.
"A roller-coaster ride of emotions".
Who said that?
A critic.
Okay, my shrink.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Just Jack.
Touch me in the morning Honey, I'm busy.
Touch yourself.
Busy?
Oh, that's right, because in the office of Karenworld, that's considered filing.
Oh, I forgot.
You're kind of funny.
All right, I'll talk to you.
What are you doing?
Why are you here?
What's that?
This is the flyer from my nightclub act.
You have to come.
Why?
Who's gonna be there?
Let me remember, who's on the guest list?
The king of-- I'm gonna be there!
Why?
ls that not enough for you?
Oh, come on, please come.
Please, please, please Be your best friend.
Honey, I don't really do that.
All right, what time?
The magic starts at 10:00.
Bring someone.
Let me show you my entrance.
No, no, no Honey, you don't just saunter out like that.
You're not Merv Griffin.
Come back tomorrow, and we'll work on it, okay?
Karen, you can't just devastate me, and kick me out.
You're not my lover.
Honey, reel it in.
All right, fine.
I'm leaving flyers, give them to friends.
Yeah, right.
"Just Jack"?
The magic starts at 10:00.
Was that a proposition?
No, that was just Jack.
I'm Harlin Polk.
I'm supposed to meet Grace.
I'm Karen Walker.
I'm supposed to be Grace's assistant.
You don't strike me as the assistant type.
Well, honey, behave yourself, and I won't have to strike you at all.
Go on, honey, sit down.
Grace will be here in a minute.
I noticed you have one of those flyers.
- You goin'?
- Oh, honey, I'm always goin'.
Hi.
Oh, Harlin.
Hi, you're here.
Good.
Will just showed me your apartment, and I love it.
- She loved it!
- Yeah.
I've got a lot of ideas.
We can go color, earthtones, minimal, ethnic, mélange-- Iet me apologize right now for my brazen use of the word mélange.
Mélange is a French term that designers use.
- It means sort of a whole-- - Will?
Don't you have some fish in your shoes to feed?
Absolutely.
Gotta go, and feed my shoes.
That's just a thing Will and l-- you probably didn't get it.
Whatever I don't get, I just figure is gay.
Okay.
Okay.
If I were an animal skull, where would I wanna be?
-  - Hang on, Harlin.
- Harlin, hi.
- Howdy.
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.
- Will?
- Well, hi.
Sorry, l-- You know, Grace, at some point that dog needed water.
- Will, what are you doing here?
- Don't get mad, - he asked me to come.
- Fine, but not one word.
- Just a pimp.
- Okay.
Look at this!
I've only done the living room, but this should give you an idea of the direction I'm going.
It's Texas meets New York.
It's Ralph Lauren meets cowboy chic.
It's "Dances With Wolves," and deer, and cows, and one very slow armadillo.
Whoa!
Uh, saddle.
You say, "Whoa"!
Harlin, take a seat.
Feel the leather on this couch.
You know, Grace, I love the way you've got the-- turquoise vases over the top of the armoire.
- What?
- You know, the way they're over the top?
Over the top.
- Wait, he's-- - And these pillows.
Look at these pillows.
Don't they just say--  Maybe you don't speak pillow, but trust me, that's what they'd say.
I think Grace would agree with me when I say that this is an extreme version of an idea that Grace will now distill into a more refined, elegant essence.
No.
Actually, I wouldn't agree with that at all.
And you can see what I've done over here.
- Ow!
- What now?
Sorry, I was gored by the comfy chair.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Sublimating my rage towards you with cheesecake.
You just couldn't help yourself.
You did exactly what you said you weren't gonna do.
- What was that all about?
- What's that apartment all about?
Could you have been more insulting?
It looked like Gene Autry exploded in there.
I didn't design it for you.
I did it for a 6'4" man from Texas.
If I was doing "young gay lawyer," it'd be deco with "fear-based bitchy" wallpaper.
- I know Harlin-- - Yeah!
And I know design.
If you called me at work and I wasn't there, the answering machine would say "Grace Adler Designs".
If you opened my purse, my business cards would say "Grace Adler Designs".
Seems like the only person who doesn't know Grace Adler Designs is her best friend!
Let me introduce myself!
I'm Grace Adler!
I design!
- Wow, I'm cutting you off.
- No, no, no!
This is not the cheesecake talking!
This is know-how talking, and I know how to design for Harlin.
That place is perfect for him.
So come on, lawyer, tell me what Harlin said after I left.
He said you're fired.
He said what?
- He said you're fired.
- That's it?
That's Harlin.
He's a man of few words.
- Not even a howdy?
- No howdy.
No, no, no.
No, I'm not fired.
I'm gonna call him.
You're not gonna call him, Grace!
You're fired!
No, I don't get fired, and I definitely don't get fired by you.
- I didn't fire you, he fired you.
- I am not fired.
- Grace, you are so fired.
- Do not say that again.
Oh my God, I'm fired.
Yeah, you're f-- the F word.
You still wanna go and see Jack's show?
- You screwed this up for me.
- What, do you say it's my fault?
Yes!
Of course, it's your fault.
You sat there and you ridiculed every piece of furniture right in front of him!
Because every piece of furniture was a hollowed-out animal.
- Harlin said that?
- Yea-- no!
He didn't verbalize that, but I think the expression on his face said everything.
The expression on his face didn't say anything other than "Hey, I'm Harlin's face"!
You made it impossible for him to say that he liked it.
Grace, don't you think it's possible, maybe, that he didn't like it, because you made some bad choices?
No!
All right, can we talk about this later?
We have to get ready for Jack's show.
Wear the blue sweater.
We are so taking separate cabs.
Jack: I don't know.
Do I go with the Peter Allen Copacabana sleeve, or the Julie Newmar basic black?
Come on, you're on in two hours.
Let's see some show!
Okay, I'm starting with this.
No, no, honey.
No, no, no stop, stop, stop.
Eh, coma.
I wanna sing a ballad.
I cry really good.
I can do the single tear.
Honey, you're in a gay club with a nice ass.
Start shakin' that moneymaker.
You're nasty, Miss Jackson.
Oh, honey, you have no idea.
All right, push that red button.
My kid has one of these.
- Red is samba.
- Karen, don't you-- You just push it, push it, push it.
Come on.
- Now what?
- Now let it in, honey.
Come on, come on, honey.
Up, up, up Come on, trust me.
I'll you a little somethin' here.
It's very simple.
Keep your eye on the bird.
And shoulder, and shoulder.
Easy does it.
And hips, and hips.
Add the hips.
Yeah.
And swing it, and swing it.
Saucy.
Around the world, around the world.
We like to travel, uh-huh.
Feel kinda dirty.
In the good way.
Yeah, that's taking shape, but-- here, stick with me.
There-- there you go.
Oh, oh, yeah.
There you go.
Around the world, around the world.
One-way ticket.
Paris, Brazil, Bangkok!
Uh-huh!
- Yeah, you feel the difference?
- Yeah.
What's going on, honey?
What is this?
My tummy feels funny.
Turn it off, honey.
Turn it off, turn it off.
You were right, honey.
Start with the ballad.
- Will?
- Harlin, what are you doing here?
I was in New York, and out walkin' around.
I just thought-- is Karen here?
Yeah, she's here, and she's married.
Oh!
Is she married like I'm married, or is she married-married?
I think somewhere in the middle.
- Drink?
- Scotch.
Listen, I wanted to ask you, you didn't fire Grace because I didn't like the way she did the apartment, did you?
- Of course not.
- I didn't think so, but Grace was-- Jack: Hi.
- I'm so glad you got in.
- Jack, the place is empty.
Don't upset me before a performance!
Thank you for the flyer.
This is my first time - to come to a cabaret club-- - Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm thrilled that you're here, but I'm in performance mode, so I can't really invest.
I've really gotta go to zero.
We'll talk backstage in my dressing room, okay?
- You mean the bathroom?
- That's funny.
And thanks for the flowers and the telegram.
- I didn't send flow-- - Yeah, I know.
'Cause you know that Grace, she didn't mean to offend you with the way she decorated the place.
Offend me?
I thought it was great.
I wish she could have finished the job.
Then why did you fire her?
It wasn't because of the apartment, it was because of the tension between the two of you.
I'm in the middle of my marriage breaking up and I didn't want to be responsible for breaking up another-- whatever that is you two got goin'.
What are you-- what are you saying?
- You fire her because of-- - Because of you, Will.
So what if I butt out?
What if I go gay?
Come on, Will.
You are who you are.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to use the backstage.
Howdy, partner.
Come on.
Sit down.
The show is starting.
Sit, sit, sit.
He's a little nervous, he's a little nervous.
Oh, hell.
I'm a little nervous.
Woo!
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Jack McFarland, but for tonight, I want you to think of me as Just Jack.
Hi, Grace.
- Hi.
- First of all: I still hate you, - and you will be punished.
- Okay, but-- - but about the whole Harlin-- - I was thinking - on my way over here in the cab-- - --but I think you should know-- --okay, maybe you should stop butting in for once, please.
Okay.
I was thinking that maybe I was a little off the mark in my design concept, and I'm so sorry for getting so angry.
- Gracie-- - Hey, lady You, lady, cursing at your life You're a discontented mother, And a regimented wife Oh.
Listen, Harlin is here.
Oh my God, oh my God.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Well-- - What did he say?
He liked the apartment.
Oh, I've been to Georgia And California, and anywhere I could run Took the hand of a preacher man And we made love in the sun That actually happened to me.
Gracie, please, don't give me the squint.
I admit that I have a problem.
My name is Will T. and I am a butter-inner.
I knew it.
Look, what can I say?
You were right, I was wrong.
- You can say that?
- I just did.
- Maybe again.
- You were right.
- I think I didn't hear it.
- You were right, I was wrong.
- Oh, okay.
- Please, lady - Don't just walk away - You were right, I was wrong, - No, more, more.
- You were right, I was wrong.
- Come on, come on.
- Why I'm all alone - Loud and proud.
- You were right!
I was wrong!
Hey!
It's not the Will and Grace Show!
It's called Just Jack!
You really think this is necessary?
It's the only way we're gonna come to some kind of understanding.
Read it back.
"I, Will Truman, being the party of the first part, having caused grievous injury to the party of the second--" I could help you put this in actual legal terminology.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
You're pretending to be a lawyer.
- You pretended to be a designer.
- Point taken.
Keep going, there's more.
"The party of the first part shall heretofore never be a bittunski".
Referring, of course, to the landmark case of Buttinsky versus the City of Minneola.
- Keep writing, Mr. Insky.
- Hold on, hold on.
I just gotta get another napkin.
It's the bartender's phone number.
Sign here.
Initial here.
We're done.
You realize this is not legally binding until it's been notarized.
Case closed.
God, isn't this great?
No fans, no record execs.
Just Jack.
Just get in the cab.
- So what'd you think of the show?
- Jack, you have a beautiful voice.
- How about that dance sequence?
- Jack, you have a beautiful voice.
Did you get a look at that bartender?
- Yeah.
- I got his phone number.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- Switch.
- Whoa.
Hold on a second.
What's the problem?
My horoscope says I shouldn't rush into any change.
Gimme that.
Happy Halloween!
Listen.
Dilemma.
Donald and I were going to the parade tonight.
We had a whole Biblical thing planned.
We were going to go as Adam and Steve.
But he crapped out on me.
It's going to be hard to top last year.
They went as second-hand smoke.
Preachy, perhaps, but, uh, we saved some lives.
Will, come on.
I can only do this with you, you're my best friend.
We'll have so much fun together.
Well, how am I going to say no to that?
No.
Grace, I can only do this with you.
You're my best friend.
We'll have so much fun together.
Sorry, Halloween means nothing to me.
God can hear you right through the building and she's not happy.
Jack, what's the point of dressing up like a fairy princess, when I'm not going to get 10 feet without seeing 100 drag queens prettier than me?
News flash!
- This is a holiday for six-year-olds.
- Hey!
Halloween just happens to be the one day out of the year that makes the other 364 bearable.
This and the Tony Awards.
But fine, turn your back on the gay high holy day.
But it is sacrilege!
Will: Have a good time, and remember, wear reflective tape, get lots of candy and don't put anything in your mouth that isn't wrapped.
Karen, you have to come with me.
I can only do this with you.
You're my best friend.
We'll have so much fun together.
Oh, honey, I'm flattered but No.
No.
I had the greatest costume.
My fig leaf was an actual fig leaf.
I had to keep it in the crisper all week.
What, the leaf?
.
And then Donald decided he'd rather spend Halloween with his wife and kids.
Huh huh, now there's a costume.
Come on, Karen, come downtown with me.
Honey, I can't go.
I have a home, a husband and three beautiful stepchi-- No, wait two.
Two beautiful stepchildren.
Sorry.
Yeah, Olivia and - Mason?
- Honey, I was getting there!
You're right, you're right.
Spend Halloween with your family.
Take your husband's kids by their sticky little paws.
Knock on the doors of the neighbors that hate you, block after block after block.
- I know, it sounds heinous, but-- - In flat shoes.
You know, I've never been downtown on Halloween.
Oh my God, a virgin!
You have to come.
You'll be worshipped!
I don't know, honey.
I really shouldn't.
How?
Worshipped how?
Well, look at you.
You're like an icon to gay men.
You've got the sass, the class, the ass.
What'll I wear?
Oh, I don't know.
We'd go as a team, Iike Donnie and Marie or Sonny and Cher.
Oh, honey, you'd be cute as Sonny.
No, no, I'd be Cher.
lf I could turn back time Whoooa.
lf I could find a-- Whoooa!
Look, I'm not going unless I can be the girl, all right?
So you figure something out.
I just have one costume criterion.
Boobs up and out.
I'll show you the prospectus by the end of the day, along with the most recent fiscal projections.
Herb, let's shuck right down to the cob.
You want to buy this company, I want to sell this company.
So, let's try to work this thing out.
What do you say?
All right.
Good, good.
Send my love to Barbara.
Oh, uh, well, then send my love to Katarina.
All right, goodbye.
See, uh, I was going to close with "Shuck right down to the cob".
You know what the secret to big business is?
- Act like you don't need the money.
- You don't need the money.
Makes it that much easier.
Well, I better skedaddle.
I gotta pick up my kids.
Your kids are in town?
Yeah, they're having a tour of the stock exchange.
Are you planning on taking them public?
I'm planning on selling 'em short.
Tonight, I'm gonna show 'em a real New York City Halloween.
That ought to scare the bejeezus out of 'em.
So, uh, what are you going as?
I'm not going.
I stopped dressing up when I grew out of my mother's shoes.
You know I'm joking, right?
Okay.
Grace and I don't do Halloween.
You know, it's a kids' holiday.
Oh, you're missing out.
Halloween is the best holiday of the year.
You'll see what I'm talking about when you get married and have your own-- children.
Or-- or when you have your commitment ceremony and adopt your Himalayan whistle kid.
Or whatever it is that's in vogue with you fellas now.
Will: Here.
Taste this.
Is there enough curry?
Ho!
My God!
Hot, hot, hot!
Hot!
Oh my God, I'm sweating.
My teeth are sweating.
- So a little bit more?
- Just a touch.
-  - Jack: Open up!
It's the cops.
Jack.
$10, he's in buttless chaps.
Oh my God.
Guess what we are.
Uh, a Catholic girl gone bad and, Karen, what are you supposed to be?
Oh!
No, no, no.
We're Body and Soul.
I'm body, obviously!
And Jack is Soul.
David Soul, as in Starsky and Hutch?
Listen, we're kind of in a hurry.
Maybe I didn't mention most important day of the year.
I want to get there before the parade starts.
So, uh, one last chance.
You comin'?
Okay, okay.
We just, one thing we need to do first everything else in our lives.
Fine.
I don't dig these squares anyway.
Come on, foxy.
Let's bring down the man.
I've got your back.
Oh boy.
This is going to get real old real quick.
Okay.
The wine is breathing.
Food is under control.
Okay, pretending not to see Shirley MacLaine's lnner Workout.
I'll respond to that in my next life.
Okay, our lngmar Bergman film festival is about to commence.
- How excited are we?
- I am very excited in a bleak, desolate, existential void-y kind of way.
Jack, go away.
Grace and I are-- are naked and oiled up and about to engage in some Greco-Roman wrestling.
Harlin: How long you think that'll take?
I'm double-parked.
Harlin, that's j--, that's just something Grace and I say.
Don't explain.
It's just all part of what makes you special, Will.
- Hi, Grace!
- Hi.
Uh, what are you doing here?
Uh, kids?
With your kids.
Will: Hi.
I see the resemblance.
Look, Will.
The deal with Herb is going hinky.
He wants to have a face-to-face.
I got to fly to Boston right now.
- So you want me to come with you?
- Uh, no.
- I want you to watch my kids.
- Tonight?
!
He said yes!
Go on in.
I really feel terrible.
I didn't know what else to do.
You're the only folks I know in New York.
Oh, by the way, say-- say hello to Nixon and Buzzy Wuzzy.
- They're in character.
- Right.
Be good.
Daddy loves you a buncha oil wells.
- I'll try to get back tonight.
- Wait, wait, try?
!
Will, like I told you, Herb is hinky.
I, uh, ummm.
Hi.
My dad voted for you.
What are we going to do?
I'm allergic to bees and I'm a democrat.
Hi.
Just so you know, I'm Grace.
And I live here too, with Will.
This is not a conventional arrangement, but what is convention, really?
Grace, what are you saying?
I don't know.
I'm feeling very, "Little Tommy Has Two Mommies".
Ah, you guys breathe in there?
Want to take your masks off?
.
Would you like some curried lamb?
Or some vindaloo?
Good, Grace.
Singe their mouths.
I don't know what to do.
I'm trying.
I'm trying here.
Okay, well how about trying to get them some juice?
- Juice?
- Juice.
Juice.
Kids like juice.
- I'm all over the juice.
- Stop saying juice.
Um, hey, we got videos.
You guys like watching videos?
Good, okay.
This one's about a man that plays a game of chess with death.
Okay, let's see what the other one is.
Uh, three sisters confront the slow, painful death of their fourth sister.
You're not going to see that on Nickelodeon.
Good job!
Okay, I'm back.
Here's your juice.
Clamato.
Clamato juice.
Yeah, it's every kid's favorite drink.
The fresh taste of tomato with the tang of clam.
Oh!
No, no, no.
No, fuzzy wuzzy buzzy.
There's a house rule.
No gnawing on the $300 Chinese silk.
We gotta have something they can play with.
Do we have any toys?
I don't know what toys you have in the house but mine are very grown-up.
Well, all we have to eat is some fresh melon and fat-free Fig Newtons and the Clamato ain't movin'.
Look, let--, Iet's take them out trick or treating in the building-- half an hour, then we can eat.
Fine.
You two, we're going to go trick or treating.
- Wait.
- Why, what?
I think Mr. President has to go potty.
Okay, here's the plan.
I promised Victor, Toby, Daniel, Patrick, Little Patrick and Roy that we'd meet for a little quick drink at Boy Bar.
Then we're gonna hook up with Sergio, Steve, Anthony and Kent - on St. Marks.
- All right, all right, I get it.
It's girls' night out.
Lord, look at this place.
We're three seconds away from being mugged or pierced.
Karen, would you stop worrying?
Nothing's going to harm you.
Not while I'm around.
Uh-oh.
Nothing's gonna harm you Not while I'm around.
Oh good.
Now I feel safe.
You'll frighten 'em away with an Angela Lansbury ballad.
Come on, honey.
This place is dangerous.
I'm supposed to be uptown looking down on all this.
I'm going home.
Oh, Mr. Sister, you are so fierce.
Well, thank you, ladies.
Snap snap.
- He thinks you're a man.
- He thinks I'm a 10!
Nixon.
Hey, Nixon.
Hey!
Hey!
Nixon!
I don't want to have to tell you again.
Stop shoving your sister.
Can I get some help, please?
You guys want to watch four hours of Swedish cinema?
Then behave yourselves.
Don't run!
Not you!
Trick or treat.
- Hey, 9C!
- Jerry.
Let's see what we've got for ya.
Mmm.
Looks like all I got left is half a Zagnut.
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't throw our pumpkins, Mr. President.
I don't care how frustrated you get.
- Hello?
- Hi, l-- - Hello.
- Hi.
Um, uh, sorry about that.
I haven't seen you around the building.
You must've just moved in.
No, I'm-- I'm down from New Hampshire.
- I'm just visiting my sister.
- Really.
- I'm Will.
- Sam.
Nice to meet you.
I'm, uh, 9C.
Will?
Buzzy threw up in her mask.
I cleaned her up and she still wants to go outside.
I say we just get their candy, get them to bed and try to salvage whatever is left of our evening together, okay?
- See ya.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
That was perfect timing.
- I don't have to be doing this.
- Oh really?
I didn't have to spend Labor Day with your aunt Marsha in Boca Raton.
But not that I didn't love the Yarn Fair, but I could've done without half the condo complex pointing at me and whispering, "So that's the faigelah".
Okay.
We're playing that game?
Four words, Will.
Grandma Truman's bedpan.
- Bedpan is one word.
- Doesn't erase the memory.
- That woman made you a quilt.
- No, she sold me a quilt.
That was a contribution to the-- Whoops.
That was just a little Halloween skit that we do.
It's called Scary Grownups.
The End.
Bow.
You know what?
I've got an idea.
- How about we hit the streets?
- Good idea.
They always say that strangers have the best candy.
Come on.
Watch the pumpkin there, Mr. President.
Oh, look at me.
I'm drinking beer out of a bag.
I'm so bad.
Karen, come on, let's go.
We've already missed the scary gay goblins.
Listen to her.
Lady Complainer.
Oh, that's cute.
Is that a drag name?
Oh, I want a drag name.
Give me a drag name!
Okay, sugar, here's how you do it.
Take the name of your first pet and the first street you lived on.
Shu-shu Fontana.
Oh, it's so cute.
Honey.
H-- honey!
Come here.
What would your name be?
Umm Glen 125th.
Well, all right, girls.
Gather round.
Make-up tip time.
Okay.
First off, a blanket note about base.
Don't forget the neck, because they won't.
Those Adam's apples don't just cover themselves, now do they, girls?
!
Shu-shu rules!
Go Shu-shu!
- Oh my God.
- Hutch!
Starsky?
Well, I would have to say, that is quite a haul.
Huh?
Hey, well, Mr. Nixon, don't think I didn't see you steal that extra Abba Zabba from the doorman at the Dakota.
- So much for not being a crook.
- Uh-huh.
So, uh, you guys want to take your masks off now?
No, still not ready.
Okay.
Okay, time to swap.
Let's see what we got.
On three.
One two three.
Ooo-hoo.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Didn't those Pixie Sticks land in my bag?
Oh, whoa, whoa, easy there, grabbie.
These sticks are for my friend Buzz here, 'cause I got my eye on that jawbreaker of hers.
What do you say, Buzz, huh?
No, don't do it.
I got a nice candy necklace that'll look real nice with your yellow skin.
Come on, Buzz.
Don't make me pull rank on you.
I am after all a giant man.
And you are just a wee bee.
Now, I want that jawbreaker.
Whoa.
He pulls out the Silly String.
This is between me and your sister, mister.
And besides - I think you're bluffing.
- I don't know.
He bombed Cambodia.
I think he'd Silly String you as soon as look at you.
You're right, Grace.
This leaves me no other choice.
What you gonna do, Dick?
Huh?
You string me and I string her.
Ha!
This is great.
You two'll take each other out and the jawbreaker's mine.
After all we've been through?
Okay.
Okay.
Two can play at that game, little sister!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, let's not get all strung out.
Just everybody back off.
Nice and slow.
Nobody get string happy.
Maybe we could just put the cans down and go our separate ways.
Right.
Or Ha!
Yeah!
Oh you got me.
I'm going.
I'm silly strung.
Grace.
I'm here, darling.
- Grace!
- I'm here!
I'll miss you!
I can't live without you!
I can keep the apartment, right?
Oh!
So, this is how you don't do Halloween.
Um, how-- how did Herb respond to the prospectus?
You know, he seemed like a viable candidate as long as the-- - the FCC approves the-- - Oh, come on, Will.
You got Silly String all in your hair.
I closed the deal, we'll talk about it later.
How'd it go, kids?
Oh my God.
They've got faces.
I thought for a second that would turn out to be Gerald Ford.
I don't know what it is.
Just a weird feeling.
Okay, kids.
Let's go.
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just one piece.
Daddy made $25 million today.
Don't want it all to go to a dentist.
- See you later, guys.
- Bye.
Thank you, Will.
Thank you, Grace.
Just a kid's holiday, huh?
Okay, back to our night.
The food is reheating, the wine, still breathing.
- Movie all ready to go.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Jawbreaker's mine.
- No, no, no, no, no!
Yes!
Yes!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Hi.
- Hey.
Oh, yum.
- Give me some.
- No, Grace, don't.
Oh God.
That's disgusting.
- What is that?
- Fruit shake.
What fruit is gray?
Pears.
What?
- Oh.
- Oh, for-- Oh, Mondo Fuel?
You're trying to bulk up.
No, it's a dietary supplement.
No, it's not.
You want za big arms.
So you can get za big men, and lure them into your den of zoom-zoom.
Okay, thank you very much.
That'll be enough, Grace.
- Oh my God, what's happening?
- What?
Your buttons are popping.
Your shirt is ripping.
You're hulking up!
You're turning green!
Thank you.
Excuse me, this happens to be good for you.
Oh my God.
It says it also grows breast tissue.
You want to give it a try?
I thought I knew everything about you, but you're a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, surrounded by enigma, growing boobies.
Anyway, how are you?
I'm okay.
Karen's going on vacation, so I need to find an assistant for the week.
Karen files her nails, and thumbs through catalogues all day.
What's she gonna do on a vacation?
I guess office work.
Oh my God.
Look, don't.
It's too easy.
Just give me something' to wear, 'cause I can't walk another block in this Klingon suit.
You want us to not make fun of you looking like that.
That would be illogical.
Sit, alien cater-waiter.
Tell us of your pain.
Brandon Schwartz's Star Fleet Bar Mitzvah.
The decor, USS Enterprise.
The menu, intergalactic kosher.
Not to mention, one of the little Borgs barfed all over my clothes.
Captain, after closer examination, I believe I have identified the life form as "gaylien".
We come in peace.
Please do not rearrange our furniture.
You know what?
Goodbye.
Okay, okay.
We'll stop.
No, you won't, because you can't help yourself.
You were born bitter, nasty, mean- spirited and, of course, chunky.
And, Grace, you're not much better.
You are a follower without an ounce of decency.
Jack, do you want to work in my office for a week?
Although you have the ability to change, and that's what I've always liked about you.
Karen's going on vacation.
I need someone to help with the phones.
- Hours?
- Minimal.
- Dental?
- Lunch.
- We can work something out.
- Great.
Oh, you girls are gonna have a ball, braidin' each other's hair, and talkin' about boys, and doin' the Cosmo quiz.
You mean like, How To Tell lfYour Best Friend's A Bitch?
Yeah, already took it.
You are.
Ellen: Karen Walker's here to see you.
You're kidding.
Send her in.
Of course he is.
As a $3 bill, honey.
Did she just fall off the boat or what?
What are you doing here besides outing me to the front office?
Well, first of-- oh, Will.
The green, no.
The lawbooks are kind of cute, though.
And you work in a basement?
Honey, you've gotta move up from the street.
Otherwise, you're sittin' around all day watchin' bad shoes go by.
See, Nine West.
I love this office.
Look at these moldings.
This place has historical significance.
They filmed "Serpico" just a-- why am I defending my building?
Karen, what do you want?
Well, what I want-- is for you to get a new rug.
Oh, honey.
It's too busy, it's shoddy, I'm thinking of leaving my husband, - and those window treatments!
- What?
What?
Bamboo?
This is a law firm, not The Tiki-Tiki Room.
- Karen!
- How can you-- Forget the blinds.
Your husband?
What's happening with you and Stan?
We were about to get on our plane to go black pearl shopping in Bora Bora, when all of a sudden, I looked at Stan, and it dawned on me, marriage shouldn't be this much work.
Karen, I'm a corporate attorney.
What you need is a good divorce lawyer or perhaps just a good pharmacist.
The nastiness comes so easily to your people.
Come on, Will.
Don't patronize me.
I know exactly what kind of lawyer you are, an obscure one.
And that's why I need you.
I have to find out about Stan's corporate holdings - without him knowing.
- Really?
This is so Alexis Carrington.
Come on.
Look, I'm serious.
I'm starting to feel as if I don't own my own husband anymore.
You mean you don't know your own husband anymore.
- That's what I just said, honey.
- No, you-- you said "own".
No, I said I feel like I don't own my own-- Iike I don't-- Iike l-- oh, all right!
Ding!
Ding!
Ding!
You'd win on Jeopardy, smart guy!
When does the attorneylclient privilege kick in?
As soon as the client gives the attorney a check, but-- no, Karen.
Me as your lawyer-- me as your lawyer, consider it done.
Jack: Here's something you probably don't know about Will.
In elementary school, Will secretly loved the book-- "Are You There, God?
It's Me, Margaret".
We bonded over it in college.
- Okay, did you know that Will-- - Oh, please.
The day you know more about Will than I do, is the day I gladly kiss your butt.
Do me a favor.
Sort these tassels.
You want me to sort them by color or by size?
By 5:00.
You want to be useful?
Help the man standing behind you with the big package.
Grace, don't tease me.
- Hello.
- Grace Adler Design?
I'll sign for it.
Just your name, sir.
I don't need your phone number.
Don't be so sure sir.
Jack?
Jack?
Jack!
Hi.
Can you put that in the back, please?
Thank you.
Wow, tell me that guy did not look exactly like Steven.
- Who's Steven?
- Will's Steven.
- Will doesn't have a Steven.
- Well, not anymore, but you know-- Oh.
You don't know who Steven is.
Oops, butterfingers.
I guess one shouldn't make any promises they can't keep.
With love in your heart, and a smile on your face.
- Just tell me who Steven is.
- I'm waiting.
- Two bucks more an hour.
- I'm talking.
Steven was a guy at his old law firm.
They had a little fling last summer while he was still seeing Michael.
And let me just say, Hotty McHot.
Ss-sss.
- Last summer?
- Yeah.
He used to call him a client.
That was his code word.
"I'm having dinner with a client.
I'm drawing up some briefs for a client".
There were some briefs involved, but he wasn't drawin' them up.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Ready to hear what I have planned for us tonight?
First of all, I'm putting aside all of my food issues.
So get ready, tonight, we eat wheat.
Workin' with Jack.
How long did it take before he took one of your silk drapery panels, and wore it like a sarong?
Why are you looking at me like that?
"I Know What You Did Last Summer".
Pardon?
The movie.
I rented it.
- "I Know What You Did Last Summer".
- "Last Summer," oh, I see.
And "An Affair To Remember".
With "The Client".
- What do you think?
- All the good movies were taken.
I think you're also gonna have to watch them alone.
- Why, where you going?
- I gotta meet with a client.
A what?
A client.
- At 9:00 at night?
- Yeah.
It's the only time we could both do it.
- Who is it?
- It's just a client.
It's a new client.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, and go easy on the wheat, huh?
I don't want to come home, and find you lying on the floor clutching the phone with your finger on the nine.
Jack, good, you're still there.
Jack: Yeah.
I'm still waiting for that package.
Grace, where did you get these drapery panels?
- Emerald Fabric, why?
- No reason.
What did Will say when you asked him about Steven?
I never got to ask him about that client.
Why?
- Because he has a new client.
- What are you talking about?
Oh, like you don't know.
He's seeing someone, Jack.
I can't believe you kept this from me.
I didn't know anything about it.
No, it's gotta be something else.
Besides, the odds are against him.
He's only been with five people in the last eight years.
He's like a humpback whale.
Without the hump.
Oh my God.
So what could it be?
What could it be that he didn't tell you, and he didn't tell me?
It must be something he didn't want us to know.
Good work, Nancy Drew.
Let's meet up at Old Mystery Creek.
Jack, just get over here now.
And lose the drapes.
I can hear the fabrics rustling through the phone.
Can l-- Can I talk to you for a minute as if we were friends?
Oh, honey.
I know, I know, I give you a hard time, and I make jokes about how you never do any work.
But it's funny because it's true.
I know.
If you're set on divorce, I can help you with that, but it's gonna take an emotional toll.
Oh, I don't know, Will.
In a lot of ways, I have a very good life.
A home in the city, a home in the country, a boat, jewelry, art, cars, a chef, a trainer, - an ass-kicking wardrobe-- - Yeah, I get it.
How is the woman inside the ass-kicking wardrobe?
and a little bit lost.
Will, I don't know what it takes to make a good relationship.
I'm no expert, but the key relationships in my life are based on communication and trust.
What is he hiding?
What could be so bad?
Why doesn't he trust me?
I don't know.
Maybe it's 'cause you're rifling through his stuff.
Don't get me wrong, I do this all the time.
You're just never here when it happens.
Oh, don't worry.
Your room, boring.
So, tell me again what we're looking for.
- Something that spells doom.
-  What?
He ate all the Mallomars.
Oh my God.
He's stress eating.
He's eating because-- his business is folding.
- You think it is?
- It all makes sense.
He actually asked me when I would pay back the 25,000.
No That, he would tell me.
It has to be something worse.
God, what is he keeping from me?
Oh my God.
It's drugs.
It's drugs.
He's doing drugs.
Without me.
Not that I do drugs, but I'd like to be asked.
You know what else he wouldn't tell either of us?
lf he's sick.
He needs a kidney.
Oh my God, he needs a kidney.
Not that I would give him a kidney, but I'd like to be asked.
- Go check his bedroom.
- What am I looking for?
Doom.
I'll start with his bed.
A-ha!
I found something!
- What?
!
- Will's new jacket.
I'm swimming in it, but loving the fabric.
I don't think there's anything here.
Oh, no wonder it's so bulky.
His day planner's in here.
- This is wrong.
- You think we should put it away?
No, it's the wrong month.
Okay, here it is.
He's having dinner at the Astor Cafe - with K. - K?
Kidney!
But he wouldn't be having dinner with one.
The Astor Cafe.
- No, I can't.
- You could.
- I won't.
- You will.
- You're right.
- Yes.
It seems like despite everything, you're still in love with your husband.
I guess in a lot of ways I'm kind of like a younger, much more beautiful version of Leona Helmsley.
First, you marry for money, and then you find yourself lovin' the old coot.
Then he drops dead, and you get the money anyway.
- It's a win-win.
- My heart is full.
Give me your phone.
I wanna call Stan right this minute.
- Head, head, head.
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm just here to see someone.
- You need a reservation.
To see someone?
- We like to protect our patrons.
- What do you think I'm gonna do?
Run around the dining room, and oversalt their food?
Who's my puppy, huh?
Who's my naughty, naughty little puppy?
Wag that tail.
That's right, wag it.
Uh-oh.
Oh, I know a very, very bad, naughty puppy who's gonna have to go back on his leash.
Excuse me, could I get the check?
And an airlift out of here?
Oh, Stan?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'm gettin' another call, but I'll see you later.
Mm-hmm.
Start doing your sit-ups.
Here, honey, you got a call.
And I have to go re-apply.
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
I just wanted to know if there was, you know, anything that you wanted to tell me.
- What are you talking about?
- You're hiding something from me.
- What is it?
- How much wheat did you have?
Why didn't you tell me about Steven?
- Steven?
- Yes!
I had to find out from-- oh!
Damn it!
That's the last time I buy a phone to get a free pair of pantyhose.
Hello?
Keeping secrets is not in our rule book.
I know all about K. Well, actually, I don't know all about K. Actually, I don't know anything about K. Who's K?
Hold on.
Hello?
What?
No, I don't-- wait a minute.
We're all booked up, but it looks like we have an opening at 10:00.
Bochner for two.
Window seat?
Don't push it.
- Will-- - I am in the middle of dinner.
No, you're not.
You're already on coffee.
Okay, so I'm on cof-- where are you?
It's a secret.
Now, tell me.
How does that make you feel?
Like a sorority girl in a bad slasher movie.
Where are you?
!
Let's just put it this way, the call is coming from inside the house.
Grace, you cannot be here right now.
- Go home.
- No.
- Go home!
- No.
- Go!
- No.
Excuse me.
Would you mind having that crazed redhead removed?
Listen to me, I'm Ricky Ricardo.
- I'll take care of it, Mr. Ricardo.
- No.
Excuse me.
Look, this is insane.
Let her in, please.
Okay, what is it?
Do you need a lung?
I have two.
Pick one.
Just no more secrets.
- Grace, I tell you everything.
- Who is K?
I can't tell you.
Grace, what are you doing here?
Honey, what happened to you?
You look like an unmade bed.
Karen, you're supposed to be on vacation.
Grace, I'd like you to meet my client, K. - Hey.
- Hi.
Let me fill you in on the rest of my evening, so you don't think I'm keeping anything from you.
Will?
On the way home, I bought a pretzel from a vendor.
I think his name was Luba.
And I scraped off half the salt.
- Come on.
- Then I was in the bookstore and I was absentmindedly thumbing through "Marilu Henner's Guide To Life".
It was in the bargain bin.
She has been able to do the split since she was five?
- And bunions are her personal hell.
- I get the point.
Then, when I was almost home, I thought I recognized someone on the street, so I sort of half-waved, but then it wasn't who I thought it was, so I pretended to scratch my ear-- just so you know.
- Enough, already!
- What's the deal, Grace?
So I don't tell you about Steven.
It was a stupid affair.
I wasn't particularly proud of it, and I knew if I told you, I'd have to really examine it, when I really wanted it to go away.
But, Will, if I think you're hiding something, I'm always gonna think that you're hiding something that's much bigger than it really is.
Why would you think that?
Because I don't want you to tell me that you're gay again.
What?
When we were in college, and at Christmas break you told me you were gay, everything changed.
Of course it changed.
My whole life changed.
So did mine.
Everything worked out, but I guess I'm just still waiting for you to-- change my world with your next big secret.
You almost said "rock my world," didn't you?
Maybe.
Gracie coming out of the closet is something you only do once in life.
You know, it's like being born or watching Magic Johnson's talk show.
I promise, no more big surprises.
Good.
There is one more I should tell you about.
I'm pregnant.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Good morning.
Hi.
You're making wok food?
It's 8:00 a.m. What are we having, Hunan Cream of Wheat?
What was that?
It was a laugh.
Pajama pants and an Armani jacket.
Kind of going for a Frances Farmer thing?
Oh, yeah.
I must have forgotten to put my skirt on.
You want some bok choy?
- You're depressed.
- No, I'm not.
Then I must be really happy.
What's going on with you?
Yesterday, I saw the most perfect man.
Banana Republic face, lots of corduroy, walking a springer spaniel, and guess what?
The dog got a case of naughty snout?
Eew.
No.
Will, I felt nothing.
I have no romantic drive.
I can't even imagine feeling the urge.
Fantasies, gone.
- Not even the Baldwin brothers?
- No.
- Not Alec?
- No.
- Not Billy?
Not Stephen?
- No.
- Danny?
- No-no-no!
What about all four together?
- We're talking about me.
- Oh, yeah.
I hope you got some breakfast bars 'cause I'm in a rush.
Let me guess.
You've got a whole day of nothing ahead of you.
You know, anger doesn't really go with what you're wearing.
But then again, not much does.
I'm on the way to the gym, and I'm feeling a little peckish.
- Bok choy.
- Oh, bok choy.
What's with the get-up?
You look like an insane housewife from one of the square states.
I haven't really been feeling very-- Uh-huh.
Will, can you do something about this?
A letter from the IRS?
A red letter from the IRS?
- How many of these have you got?
- Who knows?
It's like every week with those guys.
Haven't they gotten it by now that I don't pay my taxes?
What are they, rejection junkies?
Isn't there a number on there you can call to get me off the list?
Jack, this isn't an offer for Levolor blinds.
- This is the government.
- Don't stress me out, Will.
I got 30 minutes of squats ahead of me, and that's where my concentration has to go.
Listen to me, come to my office at lunch.
Bring your receipts, pay stubs, 1099s, W-2-- Ow.
Pay stubs, receipts?
It's too much.
10 what?
I can't possibly remember all of that.
Bo Derek, Barbara Feldon.
See?
Why can't the government do that?
I hate Uncle Sam.
I'm so over older men.
Oh, honey, I think I found something to make you feel better.
Oh, Karen, you didn't have to buy me clothes.
Oh, I didn't, honey.
These are to cheer me up.
Yeah, you've been bringing me down, lady.
No, honey, these are for you.
Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley - Karen?
- Ding, ding, went the bell - Zing, zing, zing, went-- - Karen!
I don't take pills.
Grace, these are vitamins.
They're good for you.
What vitamins are in Percodan?
All right, so take them with a banana.
Come on, Grace, you gotta do something.
You're getting on my nerves.
I just think it's easier to embrace it, surrender to the gloom.
Listen to me.
I'm a bi-level haircut away from Lilith Fair.
I am not gonna listen to this.
All right, we are gonna get you on the phone with some of those dorks that used to follow you around before you met Danny, and get you out on a date.
Karen, that is my whole problem.
I'm not interested in going out on a date.
Grace, desperate times call for desperate measures.
It's time to get your head out of the dumps and your legs in the air.
Okay, why not?
Zander Freeman.
Oh, gosh, he was so sweet.
Well, there you go.
Call him.
I think I will.
He was so nice.
He liked my perfume.
And my shampoo.
He was a sniffer.
Is that weird?
I'm just gonna call him.
Will you call him for me?
Or maybe I'll seem stupid.
No, make me seem official.
Or maybe I'll seen snobby.
No, it'll be cool.
No, it'll be stupid.
Give me the card, Hamletta!
Honey, we talked about this blouse.
Oh, hello.
Zander Freeman, please.
Yes, hello, Zander.
I have Grace Adler calling.
Oh, oh, yes.
She's just as beautiful as ever.
Oh!
Oh, that's very sweet.
Goodbye!
He's gotten fat.
What?
!
What?
!
What did you just do?
!
Honey, he had the ho, ho, ho, chortle, which basically says, "I'm a fatty now".
But come on, honey.
Don't give up the ghost.
We'll get there.
Come on, spin again.
Now, if I'm gonna do this, I wanna earmark where my tax dollars are being spent.
AIDS research, and better uniforms for the Army, I dunno, something with shorts.
Do you have any idea how the government works?
No, but I do know I get a little funny in the tummy around the Washington Monument.
Come on.
Will, lots of people don't pay their taxes.
Yeah, they're called criminals.
Can we talk about something else?
You haven't paid your taxes for ever.
Let me paint a picture of how it's gonna go Nadia.
First of all, they'll give you a payment plan, which you won't follow.
Then they'll garnish your wages, which you don't have.
Then they'll take away everything you own, which would be your gym membership.
Then, finally, they will put you in jail.
No, no, no.
They can't put me in jail.
'Cause since I never started paying my taxes, I can continue not paying them.
I saw that on television.
On what?
The Delusional Channel?
Jack, AI Capone murdered half of Chicago.
Do you know what they put him away for?
One single count of tax evasion.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
What time is it?
There's a cardio- funk class I want to take.
- Magnus is teaching.
- Jack, I called the IRS.
- They're sending an agent Friday.
- A person?
Like in person?
Isn't there any other alternative?
There's Canada, but you could only wear short shorts two months of the year.
Yeah, I know, Mom.
I'm watching it right now.
No, trust me, it is not a good way to meet men.
Because gay men don't ballroom dance.
Oh, yeah, I see him.
Well, not the men I want.
I gotta go now.
The mambo competition is starting.
Yeah, I love you, too.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- What are you watching?
- National Ballroom Competition.
They're so tacky, but in that magnificent way.
I don't know where to put my emotions.
- How was your date?
- It sucked.
Gonna need a little more.
It was fine.
It was nothing.
It was beige.
He was beige, I was beige, the food was beige.
It was beige.
Did you give him a little sugar?
No.
- Did you give him a little nectar?
- No.
- A little fructose?
- No!
Nothing happened.
After dinner, he walked me to the subway.
He was talking, I was tuning in and out, and I started doing that thing where I close one eye, and he was standing in front of the bench.
Then I closed the other eye, and he was standing next to the bench.
In front of the bench, next to the bench, in front of the bench, next to the bench.
He probably thought I was flirting with him.
He probably thought you had a neurological disorder.
I don't know.
I must have a bug in my romance software.
Oo-ooh, cha-cha time.
Shall we?
I'm a freak.
You're not a freak.
Cha-cha-cha.
- What am I gonna do?
Huh?
- Dip and pivot.
I just don't get it.
Before Danny, I used to date all the time.
I was a little dating machine.
I loved men.
What's so different in my life now that I don't like men?
It doesn't make any sense at all.
What, do you want to lead?
No, it's you.
This is too much fun.
I'm having too much fun.
What?
It's-- it's you.
You're the reason it isn't working.
You're the reason I'm not interested in men.
-  - Grace: Will?
Will, open up.
I have to talk to you.
- Will?
- Grace?
What are you doing?
What time is it?
I figured out what needs to be done.
You and I have to start seeing less of each other.
Okay.
Let's start now.
No!
No, Will!
Open up!
Come on, I'm not done!
Okay, come on.
Let's go down to the sofa.
Please don't tell me you're still blaming me for your crappy love life.
Can't you just blame your parents like everybody else?
I am putting a moratorium on us, because if I'm having fun with you there is no room in my life to be having fun with someone else.
Who?
Who is this person you want to have fun with?
The other person I could be having fun with - if I weren't having fun with you.
- I'm not having fun.
- Are you having fun?
- No.
Then I guess we've achieved our goal.
Will, we have to think of ourselves more as just roommates.
We can't do everything together.
Oh my God, look at me.
I'm following you into the kitchen.
This is what I'm talking about.
We can't do everything together.
Like food, like meals.
We do too much food together.
What if we're home, and we're both hungry?
See?
Why are we always hungry at the same time?
We're too close.
We wash our delicates together.
That is just weird.
No, Grace.
No, what's weird is that I have delicates.
- You want some coffee?
- Yes.
No!
No coffee!
Oo-ooh, you're dangerous.
Let me get this straight.
If you eat breakfast alone, you'll get the urge to date?
Yes.
I have to make room in my life for romance.
So let's just do this, at least for a couple of weeks.
- I think you're wrong.
- I think I'm right.
I'd just like to go on record as saying I think this is ridiculous!
- Note taken.
- Any more rules?
- One.
Starts immediately.
- Fine.
Feeling horny yet?
Tax man: I'm not convinced.
I don't consider that a reasonable deduction.
- Jack, everything okay over there?
- I'm fine.
How do you substantiate the $2,100 for magazine subscriptions?
That's research for when he was employed as a fact-finder.
"Guy World"?
Oh, Peter, Paul, and Mary, I'm going down!
Will you excuse us just for a minute?
Please make it quick.
- Pull yourself together.
- I can't handle this.
I'm freaking out.
This is worse than when I was caught shoplifting at Lane Bryant.
You have to calm down.
We need to act professional.
I can't go to jail, Will.
I'll never pull off the jumpsuit.
I have no waist.
- If you don't just-- - No, don't let them take me, Will!
I still have a novella to write, and I've never met Barbara Eden!
My life is just beginning!
I'm sorry for that "Knots Landing" moment.
But believe me, it was necessary.
You're allotted one of those in your lifetime.
You just cashed in.
All right, bring that son of a bitch back in here, and let's wrap this thing up!
We're ready.
I gave you a couple of the other deductions.
I think we're done.
Here's the figure you owe.
Okay, uh, I'd be more comfortable with this.
Jack!
We're not buying a car.
This is fine, thank you.
I left you some forms about possible payment plans.
- Good day.
- Thanks.
What am I gonna do?
I can't come with $2,000.
Jack, relax.
There are three things in this world you can count on: death, taxes, and me.
Thanks, Will.
- Just so we're clear-- - I'm paying it!
Okay.
I went to culinary school for three years.
I don't know, I just always loved to cook-- five sisters.
And it turned out great, because while I was making Sunday dinner, they were out mowing the lawn.
Grace's voice: ln front of the bar, next to the bar.
In front of the bar-- All right, boys.
My deal.
The name of the game is seven-card stud.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks wild, Iow spade in the hole splits the pot, and don't forget to tip your dealer.
Here's a tip: cards are dealt down.
No, not in this game.
No, it's seven-card stud.
The first two cards are dealt down.
Not in my version, boss man.
It's stud poke-- You called low spade in the hole, and if all the cards are up, where's the hole?
I'm looking at him.
Oh, all right!
Blah, blah, blah!
- You deal.
- All right.
Okay, new deck.
The game is Follow The Queen.
I don't know where to turn.
Okay, Follow The Queen?
How do you know which cards are wild again?
They follow the queen.
Wow, it's like playing cards with Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Diva.
My, my, somebody's boxer briefs are in a twist.
Oh my God, Karen.
You have no idea how hard it is for Will.
Poof, Grace changes the rules, and they're not stuck at the hip anymore.
It's so hard.
- You want to go to jail?
- No, sorry.
Love you, kisses.
Okay, Karen, it's to you.
Mm-mm, I'll check.
- Jack?
- Okay, ladies.
Papa needs a new pair of flip-flops.
Could you move over?
You're a little close.
News flash, you can't catch it.
Hey, everybody.
A little pokey going on?
Karen, what are you doing here?
Jack invited me, but more importantly, what are you doing here?
You were on a date, honey.
You should have a tongue in your ear right now.
He was a great guy.
But guess what, Will?
I felt nothing.
Isn't that great?
It wasn't you.
You had nothing to do with it.
It's me.
I'm dead on the inside!
That's terrific.
Karen, it's up to you.
Oh, honey.
You sound just like Stan in bed.
- So can I get in?
- Oh no, I don't think so, 'cause that would fall under the fun category, and aren't we still in the midst of a fun embargo?
Oh no, honey.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Embargo lifted.
I'd love to let you play, roomie, but this is for your own good.
Will?
Grace, no.
This week, Joey teaches Blossom a valuable lesson about tough love.
I'm waving the white delicate.
Can we be friends again?
I dunno, I made a lot of money tonight.
I was gonna buy myself a new one.
- Ask me about my date.
- How was your date?
Don't ask.
He was handsome, sensual, talented, and not even a flutter.
It's just weird.
Grace, you're being way too hard on yourself.
So you're in a low sex drive phase right now.
Everybody gets there once in a while, except Jack, and he should be studied.
It doesn't feel like a phase.
It feels like you're trying to force something, Grace, and you can't.
It'll happen when it happens.
That's the way I'm dealing with it.
- Are we back in fun mode?
- Yeah.
Good.
Agent Grace, here is your assignment: go out and rent the video "Point Break".
We'll do a Keanu Reeves, high-fat ice cream combo pack.
Keanu in rubber, and chocolate-chocolate chip.
Now, that's a lot of sugar.
Yes!
Oh, and, Gracie, the next time you're gonna offer me a truce, wave your own white delicates.
Yours are prettier.
- Hey.
- Hi.
You ever notice the four never lights up?
- Hm-mm?
- The four never lights up.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
You're right.
Of course, now we're gonna stop at four.
Oops.
Sorry.
Look at the bright side.
We get to spend another Oops.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Will: Rethink it, Barry.
Or these conversations are gonna start getting ugly.
Hey, sweetie.
Good!
You brought lunch!
Love the outfit.
Very Audrey Hepburn.
Great.
So what you're saying is that I have the neck of a swan, and the chest of a 12-year-old boy.
Hey, way to snatch an insult out of the jaws of a compliment.
- It's a gift.
- What's for lunch?
Let's see.
Tuna with a side of coleslaw for you.
And turkey on wheat for me, with a side of-- what's this?
Oh my God.
A fabulous investment opportunity?
- That's some deli.
- Wait a minute.
What is it?
The owner of my building is selling off space.
I have the chance to buy my studio.
By the end of the year, I'd be paying less on the mortgage than I'm paying in rent now.
Sweetie, that's great.
Grace Adler, property owner.
I know!
And I don't even have to be thimble or the top hat or that weird shoe.
When do we get to the part where you start begging for free legal services?
After I remind you that I have a photo of you in dolphin shorts and slouch socks.
Okay, who's begging?
God, buying this place could be so exciting.
Just think, these could be my cracked walls, my creaky floors, my cramped bathroom with the non-specific rodent excrement in my soap dish!
Oh, honey.
Feces, no, no.
Hello, love.
You didn't tell me the owner of this building was English.
I shall find it impossible to conduct this transaction without impersonating Rex Harrison.
You naughty, naughty.
Okay, what did he say?
- He said, "Bangers and mash"!
- Will, come-- Muttonchops!
Snozberries!
Piccadilly!
If you don't stop, I'm gonna flip my eyelids up.
Okay.
Seems like a decent deal.
I think the price is still a little inflated, but I think we can get him to his floor.
- His what?
- His floor, his lowest possible price.
Sweetie, stop worrying.
- This is gonna happen.
- Yes!
Let's celebrate at Pablo's Cantina.
Oh, no.
No, Mexican.
Fajita hair.
It frizzes when the steaming chicken hits the table.
Honey, does it ever unfrizz?
Yeah.
When you do work.
Oh, honey.
Oh!
Oh!
I got it!
Let's try that new German place on 3rd, The Hofbrau.
Oh, no, no German.
I can't handle the schnitzel mit my poopik in da kichel-- Okay, enough with the accents!
You know I hate the accents.
But of course.
Okay, okay, okay, let's go.
Big news!
Hit it!
B-l-G-N-E-W-S!
Big news!
I guess we know it's not you coming out of the closet.
Correct.
I finally found my life's calling, and it involves these two hands.
Ah, so you're going to be self-employed.
Insert laugh here.
I'm going to be a massage therapist.
It was an obvious choice, being that I'm a people person.
I love people, as long as they're not hairy.
Or smelly, or have the dreaded "backne".
Okay, I need some guinea pigs.
Who's interested?
- Smelly.
- Hairy.
Thank you, friends.
Backne.
Who am I kidding?
It's alabaster from my neck to my ass.
I just don't want to do it.
You are so beautiful To me Jack, I don't need a masseur.
Come on, Karen.
I need 100 hours to get certified.
Besides, I'm very attuned to the contours of the female form.
Just because you had a Growing Up Skipper doll doesn't mean you're ready for the real thing.
Right?
You are zo beautiful To me I'm not even that crazy about massages in the first place, honey.
Can't you see-ee-ee-ee-ee All right, all right.
Come over to my place.
We'll do it on the lunch hour.
any time between 12:00 and 4:00 is fine.
So I'm pruning my CD collection and something has to go.
What's it gonna be?
Bananarama or the soundtrack to "Footloose"?
When was the last time you listened to them?
- 30 minutes after I got them.
- Toss them both.
Are you ready to be in the presence of greatness?
Tell me.
I just got my landlord to the floor.
You slut.
After you left, Mr. Hutt came up to tell me that there was another buyer ready to put an offer on my studio.
My studio.
But did I sweat?
No, I leapt into action.
Wait a minute.
You didn't sign anything?
Damn right, I did.
After I gave him a bid and he bit.
I got him to knock off 5%.
Sucka!
Grace!
5% is not the floor.
That's like a tchotchke on the coffee table on the throw rug on the floor.
Why didn't you call me?
He said he tried to call you, but that you didn't return his calls, - so l-- - Grace, he never called me.
I was in my office all day.
He lied to me?
But that's so dishonest.
I know.
To think in New York City that someone could actually try to shaft you in business, it's shocking.
People can-- can be such meanies.
Oh my God.
I hate myself.
Wait a minute.
Why go there?
It's negative.
I hate him.
I hate the British.
With those bony hands, and that Princess Anne with her horse teeth.
Lose the Boy George CDs!
Hey, hey.
Do not take this out on the Boy.
He gave us a month and a half of some very good music.
I think I can fix this thing with your landlord, but, might get a little ugly.
Play hardball, baby.
Throw him low and inside.
He's crowding the plate, - and we gotta go for-- - Grace?
Sports, you're losing me.
Okay.
This is just gonna take me a minute.
In the meantime, why don't you take some deep cleansing breaths, and try to relax, okay?
Damn it!
Piece of crap!
I'm sending you love and light.
Yeah, love and light.
Got it.
Hey, you know, I have told her about this.
Rosario, por favor, honey.
Easy on the fabric softener, okay?
No, no, honey.
Enougho with the April Fresho.
Right now she's calling me a bitcho.
All right, I guess we're ready.
"Hello, welcome.
My name is Jack McFarland, and I will be your massage therapist".
Now, I want you to take off your robe, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.
- The sheet will drape you, so-- - Yeah, I've done this before.
Skin to the wind!
Wow, Karen!
You could bounce a quarter off that thing.
Okay.
"Are there any specific areas that are troubling you"?
Yeah, my marriage.
I mean your body, Karen.
Well, I dunno, I guess my lower back is a little tight.
Ah, yes.
"Lower back pain.
That means you're holding onto something".
Yeah, my patience.
Can we just start it so we can end it?
!
And, hey, be sure to keep your hands off of my-- - How are we gonna deal with this?
- Just gonna do a little business.
Let me do the talking.
You're just the strong silent type with an angry look.
Angry, not constipated.
Just be the strong silent type.
Mr. Truman.
Mr. Hutt, appreciate you're coming.
You know Grace?
- I do indeed know Miss Adler.
- How well?
She's been my tenant for about-- I don't think you know Grace at all.
- Pardon me?
- You don't know her, pal.
'Cause if you did, you'd know this woman knows absolutely nothing about business.
Mr. Truman, your client is a perfectly competent-- Competent?
Did you say competent?
Look at her!
Does she look particularly business-minded to you?
Does this hair say,"I went to the Harvard Business School"?
- Will-- - She's a designer.
A designer!
You know what's up here?
Pretty pillows, floor lamps, maybe a couple of chenille throws, and the-- the-- that's all folks!
Not a whole lotta room left for numbers!
Which is why she caved in at 5%, and you took advantage of that.
- I thought the price was fair.
- Fair?
Fair?
Did you hear that, Grace?
Apparently, the British have a different definition for the word "fair," you know, the way "Iift" means elevator, or "fag" means cigarette?
- Mr. Truman-- - No, no, no, I wanna know more about what you think is fair.
First of all, there was no other buyer, was there?
And you and I both know you never tried to get me on the phone.
Unless you want me to place a little call to the head of the real estate board, otherwise known as my friend Beth, and let her know the way you did business with this naive, vulnerable, clueless artiste, then I'm gonna need a little bit more compensation.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Perfectly.
Perhaps this price would be a bit more agreeable to you?
Now, that is a floor.
I'll have my office draw up the new papers, and I'll bring them by tomorrow.
May I leave?
Please.
Oh, do I love doing that.
You were great, baby.
That Hausfrau place, that was good.
- Do you want to go back there?
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're starving after all the digs and the jabs.
You go, boy.
You must have really just worked up an appetite.
- It was just business.
- No, it is good business.
Boy, you didn't even have to search for those insults.
Just went-- would just drop-- right out of the mouth, didn't it?
- Grace?
- You know, I'm impressed.
The way you just cut right to the heart.
Bull's-eye!
You got me!
You got all of me.
The hair, the empty head.
I'm just surprised you didn't go after my big feet.
That would of knocked off what, another 20 bucks?
I don't believe you.
Come on, Grace.
That was a ruse to get him to lower the price-- a gambit, a canard.
So what you're saying is that you didn't mean any of it.
Where is this coming from?
You don't think I'm a good businesswoman.
- Grace.
- Say it.
Say, "Grace, you're a good businesswoman".
- I want to hear you say the words.
- Come on, Grace.
- Let's-- - Say it.
If you believe it, you should have no trouble saying it.
Do you think I'm a good businesswoman?
That is such a loaded-- It's hard to say, is a person a-- I didn't think so.
I've been waiting for those hands all day.
Karen, you're wearing me out.
When am I gonna have time to study the parts of the body?
So far, I only know phalanges, and that's just 'cause I like saying "phalanges".
Honey, I don't want to hear it!
Just do what you do, and do it to my deltoids.
This mama's like a rock.
And I don't want you massaging anyone else.
You belong to me now.
- Don't hate me.
- Don't talk to me.
- I have to talk to you.
- I have to hate you.
How long are you gonna stay mad at me?
I was doing what you asked me to do.
Did I or did I not get you the lowest possible price?
- You're still hating me.
- You're still talking to me.
Okay, that's him.
Now, just sign the papers, and hate me at a more appropriate time, Iike when I shave with your Epilady.
Let's get right down to business, shall we?
Here is the new purchase price agreement that we've agreed upon, correct?
Correct.
Now, if I can just get a signature.
It's okay, Grace.
You can sign it.
- No.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm not signing anything.
- Grace, please sign it.
This was supposed to be easy, and fun, Iike the TV Guide crossword puzzle.
Who are they kidding?
"Close Encounter of the blank Kind"?
But, this hasn't been easy or fun, and I'm-- I just don't feel good about it anymore.
Grace?
Time to take off your exposed nerve hat, and put on your business bonnet.
You know what?
I'm sorry.
I can't just turn it on and off like you.
If you prick me, I bleed, and right now, I am bleeding because of a particularly unforgivable prick.
Maybe I should come back another time.
- Why don't you do that?
- I can't come back another time.
I'm leaving for London in the morning.
I need this signed.
And she'll sign it.
Grace?
You know what the funny part is?
There is no funny part.
My life is so unfunny, Mr. Hutt, it's not even-- funny!
What am I doing taking on a mortgage?
My life is already a mess.
I'm still renting an apartment, I don't have a driver's license, I'm not married, I live with a gay guy-- Grace?
I haven't had sex in five months!
And I was in Bloomingdales this morning waiting on line to buy wrinkle cream, and this Jennifer Love Michelle Sarah Felicity-looking thing bumps into me and says, "Excuse me, ma'am"!
Grace?
Gracie, it is not worth it.
Don't buy the place if it's gonna make you feel like this.
Do I look like a ma'am?
Miss Adler, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
No, Mr. Hutt, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that you had to see me like this.
Miss Adler, about this contract?
No, no.
I can't right now.
I just-- I can't.
Grace, you may-- Miss Adler, it's not much, but perhaps I could lower the price a bit more.
Think about it.
All right?
Now look at me and tell me I'm not a good businesswoman.
Oh, you're early.
I haven't even had time for a steam and scrub.
I guess you'll just have to touch me dirty.
Blow.
Where's your table?
I didn't bring it.
But what do you mean, you didn't bring it?
I'm tired of being just a pair of hands to you, Karen.
Oh, but you're so much more than that, Jack.
Why, you're elbows and forearms and thumbs and wrists, and-- Stop it!
It's over!
Over?
Who do you think you are?
It's not over until I say it is.
I'm paying you good money.
What?
You want to go back to serving shrimp puffs at museum fundraisers?
I didn't think so.
So I'm going in there, and take off my clothes, and when I come back, we're just gonna do it!
No!
Karen, I can't do it anymore.
Every day I come in here, and I touch your naked body.
We don't talk, there's no emotion.
I'm acting like a straight guy, and it's making me sick.
I took an oath in front of God, and my mother!
I'm here, I'm queer, get used to it.
Oh!
Oh, what do I see?
Is that a five?
Allow me.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
That'll be $1,700, please.
- I have a pink five.
- Oo-ooh.
I guess then you'll have to mortgage that little tenement on skid row.
Sucks for you.
Stick to Candyland, girlie.
What is it with you?
Why is it every time money and property are involved, - you turn into a-- - Skillful, savvy negotiator?
Mine only had four letters in it, but yeah.
It's the way I have to do it.
Let's face it, I'm not the kind of guy that hammers out a contract on the 18th hole or closes a deal over brewskis at Billy's Topless.
First of all, who closes a deal at Billy's Topless, except maybe Billy?
And second of all, don't tell me that you're gonna pull out the gay card.
- It is a lot harder for a gay man-- - Because if you're pulling out the gay card, I'm pulling out the girl card, and we both know that the girl card trumps the gay card.
Don't make me get my friend Joni over here.
Because we both know that the only card that trumps the girl card is the gay girl card.
Okay, I'm not losing this.
I will call Jill, my African-American, bi-curious, dyslexic-- forget it, I'm exhausted.
I fold.
That's a good move, because I happen to know a differently-abled transsexual with split ends, and that beats the house, mister.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Okay, she's a lawyer, and she pees with men.
- Ally McBeal, click.
- Yes.
Oh!
I can't stand him.
- Dennis Miller.
- Yes.
A female singer.
Really, really skinny.
Everybody that ever performed at Lilith Fair?
Gonna need more.
If she misses her next meal, her "heart won't go on".
- Celine Dion!
- Yes!
And time is up.
- Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-- - Hoo.
Okay, so let's see.
We've got 30, and you have 217.
Hey!
So you're in second place.
- Can I get a refill?
- Coming up.
You know Celine Dion was on Oprah the other day?
Harry and I watched it together.
How cute is that?
- I swear, he likes it.
- Our Lindsay doesn't like TV.
She'd rather go to the park, play with her little friends.
Hey, how about those Knicks?
See how desperate I am to change the subject?
- I'm referencing sports.
- You're right.
- Sorry.
- Just one more little thing.
Harry caught a ball for the first time and I got it on videotape.
Oh my God, you got it on videotape?
Will, she got it on videotape.
You didn't get it on videotape by any chance, did you?
Honey, you play favorites, and I think Riley knows it.
- No, I don't play favorites.
- You play favorites.
No, she just annoys me.
The bitch fights me when I put her in my car.
- You have to call her a bitch?
- She's a bitch, Rob.
Do you have to call her a bitch?
Do we have to spend another evening talking about everybody's dogs?
You just feel guilty 'cause I'm ready for one and you're not.
Now, that's just Grace's way of saying that her biological clock is barking.
You don't have to breed.
There are lots of options.
You can adopt.
Hey, look at the time!
It's a quarter to get out!
Grace: I can't believe I let you drive me here, Jack.
- Will doesn't want a dog.
- I know, I know.
Please, listen.
I just spent the last about the evils of smells, stains, drooling and shedding.
I said, "It didn't seem to bother your ex-boyfriend".
Oh, look.
A Lhasa apso.
Hello, my little poop.
Hello, my little smelly poop.
Honey, honey, the puppy talk.
Really trying to keep the crab cakes down.
But look how sweet he is, sitting in his bowl.
Yeah, he's gifted.
Look, just pick one!
Spay him, spray him, throw him in a bag, and let's get out of here!
No.
I told you, I can't get a dog.
Oh, come on, Grace.
You have to for Will's sake.
My God.
They're total guy magnets.
I once had a golden retriever and the man candy he retrieved golden!
Ruff!
Look, a Chihuahua.
- Oh, he's looking right at me.
- Honey, he's got cataracts.
He's looking at two to three months, tops.
Buenas noches.
Oh my God.
I am done.
Honey, come on.
What's the problem?
You can have anything you want.
You just have to learn to compromise.
Take me and Stan.
If he wants a little touchy-touchy, well, if I cooperate, then I get a house in the Bahamas!
It's tit for tat.
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do here.
Just pick out a freaking dog, Grace.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Got Thai food again.
Mainly because I'm obsessed with the Yum Yai salad.
It announces its own goodness right in its name.
Yum Yai.
You're kind of a geek.
Help me out here.
What's a four-letter word for elevator man?
Otis.
Whoa, you're smart.
I got a dog.
What?
!
Yeah, you're really smart.
You must have gotten really high scores on your SATs.
Grace!
He is the best.
You're gonna love him.
He is so cute.
He even looks like you.
He's got your eyes.
Damn it, Grace, I said no.
- And your fangs.
- Where is he?
He is somewhere taking up no space and being absolutely delightful.
Come on, Will, give it a chance.
The woman at the adoption center said we can keep him for a week and then decide.
Grace, it's a dog, not the Ronco Fry Daddy.
- Come on, Eileen!
- All right, you-- You do what you want, but I just don't think it's fair to ask a dog to sleep outside, when it's this cold out.
Will, the dog's not gonna sleep outside.
Oh, really?
'Cause I figured you'd want some company.
Fine.
Forget it.
- You're weird and inhuman.
- Grace, don't make a big thing-- - I told you I wasn't into dogs.
- Whatever!
Never mind.
I'll bring him back tomorrow.
Thank you.
Is that him?
No.
It's veteran character actor Charles Durning.
Can you just watch him, just for a minute?
He just had some first-day jitters in my bathroom.
I just wish you'd understand where I'm coming from.
When I said I wasn't a dog person, I meant it.
Her-roh.
Oh, you had me at her-roh.
You had me at her-roh.
Can we just talk about how many cute guys were swarming around you at the park?
They just wanted to see my sweet bundle of love.
Yes, they did.
Did you believe when he almost caught that Frisbee?
Oh, that was my fault.
I threw it too high.
By the way, I don't think it's such a great idea that you yell at him like that in front of the other dogs.
A light and breezy tone just doesn't cut it when he's eating a woman's blood-pressure medicine.
No, no, I understand that.
It's just that you shamed him.
Will, you can't shame dogs.
They're not defendants on Judge Judy.
You pointed at him with the little witchy-poo finger, and you yelled at him in front of his friends.
- His friends?
- Whatever.
The point is you're just-- you gotta relax, and give him a chance to be who he is.
These are important years.
He's gotta develop a sense of himself.
Will, I'm not your mother.
And I promise, if he's gay, I won't stand in his way.
You thirsty?
You want some Evian?
Come on, boy.
Get your Evian.
Here.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I meant to tell you, I enrolled him in doggie day care.
Wait, what day care?
The Yuppy Puppy.
The Yuppy Puppy?
Day care for the urban professional's dog.
Do you know these people?
I don't know these people.
I don't want a stranger raising my dog.
Didn't you see that thing on "Dateline," when that woman was hitting the dog on the snout with his squeaky lambchop?
Will, that was not Yuppy Puppy and it wasn't "Dateline".
It was "Animals Do The Darndest Things".
I'm sorry, but I think it's best that you stay home tomorrow, and take care of him.
Doink!
Okay, Master.
I will be home anyway, because I'm having the sofa in my bottle reupholstered.
Get over yourself!
I'm working, too!
Fine, Sarcasmo.
I'll take him to work tomorrow, and you can take him the day after.
- I'll walk him in the morning.
- I'll walk him after work.
And I'm gonna want him every other weekend, and all the Jewish holidays.
Harlin, I would strongly advocate cash funding in lieu of a stock swap.
Yes, that liver is nummy, isn't it?
It's nummy.
Because the PIE ratio really points out the inflated value of the company, don't you think?
I don't know, Will.
Nummy seems a little strong.
I think I'd go with tasty-wasty.
You like some water, boy?
Gulp, gulp, gulp It's funny, I've never thought of myself as a dog person.
That's right.
You people like the cats.
And by "you people," you mean?
Lawyers, of course.
Let me take that prospectus with me on the plane.
Got it right here.
I am so sorry.
Mergers make him really nervous.
Don't be mad.
Oh, I'm not mad, Will.
I'm just a little pissed.
Grace, the bitch we hate is on line one.
Hi.
Yes, the fabric just came in, and it is absolutely gorgeous.
Yes, I know it's taken forever, but that is the price you pay for imported silk damask.
Yeah, that and $2,000 a yard.
No, you're right.
That's not funny.
No, but the great thing is that we have enough for the chair, the ottoman and settee, so we can get started right away and-- bad!
Bad!
Bad!
No, no, no I wasn't talking about you.
I was talking about my assistant.
Bad!
Bad!
Horrible, horrible.
Excuse me, can you just hold on a second?
Thank you.
Okay, baby.
Baby?
Let go, sweetie.
This-- no, this is not a game.
Okay, let go, let go, let go!
Hi, honey.
This is Karen, Grace's assistant.
Listen, rumor has it silk damask is out.
Yeah.
Who do I love?
Who do I love so much I want to drop-kick?
Who, boy?
Who?
Who, who?
Who, who, who?
- Hi.
- Hi.
May I bite your snoots?
May I bite your snoots from loves?
Please stop pluralizing everything.
But he's so cutes!
Look at mes.
I can't believe you are still playing with the puppy.
We've been home for three hours, and you haven't moved.
- So what?
- So it's a little obsessive.
- No, it's not.
- Oh, really?
On the cab ride home, I noticed you had puppy breath.
He made the first move.
- You and I are going out tonight.
- How can we go out?
Okay, guys, we're here.
Get out.
What are you two doing here?
We're the babysitters.
Mr. Truman, I hope you don't mind, but I like brought my girlfriend Valerie here so we can make out.
You and I are going to a movie.
I asked Jack to babysit the puppy, and, Karen, what are you doing here?
Oh, Jack asked me.
It was either this, or my neighborhood watch meeting, and if I have to hear Marlo Thomas one more time-- "Phil recycles this, Phil recycles that".
Oh, yeah.
I feel good about this, Ieaving our puppy with Cruella DeVille.
And Karen.
Will, we need this.
We haven't gone out in a week.
We're like 100 cans of peas, and some racist literature away from being survivalists.
I'm going to get my coat.
Okay, so what are we calling him now?
We're still not sure.
I like Otto.
Oh, fat dog.
Like father, like son.
What would you suggest, Jack?
I don't know.
I was thinking something more along the lines of Jack.
Let me think.
"Jack, quit licking that man's face".
He'd never know who I was talking to.
Oh, my side.
Okay, let's go.
I want to stop by the ATM for 100 bucks so I can get Goobers.
Now, Gracie, you go, although I think it's best I stay here.
No, honey, go.
Go on, have a good time.
We'll take good care of your place.
And your little dog, too.
He's kidding.
Okay?
Come on, let's go.
Will?
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Come on, Will.
Here, fetch, Will.
Okay.
Fine, but I'm taking my cell phone.
You call if you need anything.
The vet's number's on the fridge.
Play him some music.
He likes REM, but the early stuff, nothing after he shaved his head.
Did they say feed him now or later?
Forget the pooch, where's the hooch?
!
I noticed you bought the cheap kibble.
What's with that?
Will, this is supposed to be our night out.
- Can we watch the movie, please?
- Oh, fine, fine.
You told them where the Snausages were, right?
They'll find 'em, they'll find 'em.
I left some in every drawer just in case.
Snausages.
- Is this seat taken?
- No, knock yourself out.
Hey, hi.
Remember, we met at John Canalie's party?
Oh, yeah.
I remember.
Jack knows how to use the retractable leash, doesn't he?
Hello, Father Will.
Cute and interested at 9:00.
Jack: Do "The Hustle".
Hey, look Karen.
We're at Studio 54.
Hi, Liza.
Hi, Mischa.
And look now, there's Bianca.
Woo!
Honey, I'm so glad I took it upon myself to thin out Grace's closet.
I just could not let her go on thinking she could pull off yellow.
Grace.
A skort?
Rosario, this is your lucky day.
Oh, oops.
Here, puppy.
Here, puppy.
Pace yourself, Cujo.
What time is it?
Oh my God, it's 11 :00.
- Where's his leash?
- What?
Why?
What's going on?
What's happening?
What are you telling me?
Well, it's last call.
This is when all the hotties take their dogs out for a final poop-n-cruise.
All right, I guess I'll head home.
Time to pay for that house in the Bahamas.
All right, pup, it's show time.
And focus, Uncle Jack needs a new pair of shoes, preferably with a 6' gorgeous hunk o' man in them.
Hello, Jack?
Kare-- I knew we shouldn't have left him with those two.
It was like letting the Von Bulows babysit.
They're probably out walking him.
I cannot believe you could not sit through a 90-minute movie.
Forgive me for caring about the dog.
Are you implying that I don't care about the dog?
- You treat him like he's a-- - Dog?
He is a dog, not the Lindbergh baby.
I know he's a-- oh my God.
He left his chewy boot.
- Will?
- This is his transition object.
- Wow.
You are obsessed.
- No, I'm not.
- Gimme your wallet.
- What?
Gimme your wallet.
Don't know what that's gonna prove.
You are carrying around a picture of your dog in your wallet.
You weirdo!
I love this dog!
We totally bonded.
We just sat there together in the park.
He checked out butts, I checked out butts.
Where have you been?
You better not have taken this dog to Boylesque.
Because God forbid he see a half-naked man, given that he is a completely naked dog!
Let's take a dysfunction reading in the room, shall we?
Oh, yeah, the wind's a' blowin'.
George, Martha, we'll be in the kitchen eating the free food.
Let us know when it's intermission.
- I'll be joining you.
- Oh, of course.
So you can obsessively monitor every milligram that he eats.
I think you've got me confused with your mother.
I would be very careful about opening the mom-bashing door.
I've got a lotta bullets in my belt.
Please stop the fighting.
I simply can't take the fighting.
Oh, it's not your fault, little one.
Sometimes bad people happen to good dogs.
- You know what I think this is?
- Yeah, I do.
I think you think that it's about me wanting a kid, or something Sally Jessy stupid like that.
- You need to go out on a date.
- What?
You need to be giving all this love and affection to something that's, I don't know, paper trained?
Go on a date, Will.
It's time.
You already have your pickup line, "May I bite your snoots from loves"?
Men were all over you at the park.
A cutie sat right next to you in the movie theater and all you were interested in are Liver Snaps.
Snausages.
Whatever, same food group.
You don't need another reason not to be open to-- Okay, okay, okay.
Message received.
- Even if that is true-- - It is.
- Even if it is-- - It is.
Boy, you're tough.
We still have a bigger problem.
I know.
I can't take him to work every day.
What about going back to my idea of doggie day care?
No, I just can't do that to a puppy.
It's not fair.
Then what are you suggesting?
He deserves to be with someone who can spend tons of time with him.
Who do we know that has that much time on his hands?
You know, I'm not very fond of blondes, but you are fabulous.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
What are you doing?
It's freezing.
Come on.
My God, it looks like I'm hiding push-pins in my T-shirt.
Ladies and gentlemen, Grace, unplugged.
I would have laughed if I were warm, - and that was funny.
- Come on.
- Stand on the vent.
- Oh my God.
Just when I'd given up hope, heat.
I'm in heat.
Oo-ooh.
Keep it up, Grace.
You're this far from pay-per-view.
How did you do it?
I bribed the super to fix the heating vent.
His English isn't so great, but I think the deal is one of us has to sleep with him.
I'll do it, as long as it's on top of this vent.
Hey, hey, hey, don't bogart the warm.
I need to thaw my feet.
Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff.
Give it to me, baby.
Keep it coming!
Feel the heat!
Would you two like to be alone?
Man: Mm-mm, you taste good.
Excuse me?
Shh, listen.
Woman: That was amazing.
Man: God, the candlelight on your face.
You're beautiful.
Woman: You make me feel beautiful.
Man, even disembodied voices are getting more action than I am.
It's sweet.
I can't help but take it personally.
Woman: Mm-mm.
She "mm-mm-ed".
Okay, now she's just throwing it in my face.
Woman: Oh my God.
It's almost one.
Dennis?
Dennis, stop.
My husband's gonna be home any minute.
Both: Husband?
Woman: I can't live like this anymore.
Well, he can't either.
- Husband: Well, I can't either.
- Huh?
See?
Careful, girlie.
You're gonna end up with waffle face.
This is pathetic, Grace.
What, you come home early just to catch "Days Of Our Vent"?
No.
I thought I would cook shepherd's pie.
Pray tell, Julia Child, what's in shepherd's pie?
Shepherds?
Sheep?
Pie?
Sounds like a crock o' sheep to me.
Who cares about shepherd's pie?
The poor husband slaves away while she carries on an affair every day this week-- - except Wednesday.
- Which, ironically, is hump day.
You should hear her with the boyfriend.
She does this whole "of-ten" and "hwhere" thing.
And with her husband, it's "often" and "where".
She's gross.
I think the husband is totally on to her.
Woman: I told you I'm not seeing anyone.
Oh!
Ooey is such a liar!
- How could she lie like that?
- I don't know.
Why don't you ask her up for some shepherd's pie, and ask her?
Wait a minute.
Her name is Ooey?
No, it's just that they're always walking out of the room when he says her name, so all I get is "Ooey".
What do you think of my glasses?
What do they say?
They say, "Guys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses".
And guys don't make passes at guys with fat asses.
I think they make me look smart.
It's the intellectual equivalent of stuffing a sock in your pants.
Funny-funny-funny-funny, funny!
Grace, what are you doing?
I'm listening to the couple downstairs.
Fine, don't tell me.
I'm ready for you to read my play.
Wait, whoa.
What play?
You're a writer now?
Sarcasm noted and quickly forgotten.
Bye-bye.
For your information, I've been taking a playwriting class at the Learning Annex.
That explains the scathing "fat ass" retort.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just forget it, and have dinner, and you'll read it after I leave.
- Dinner?
- Yeah.
Will invited me to dinner.
You were there, Grace.
Don't you remember?
We discussed you making your famous moist-free chicken.
Oh, no.
Oh, that's right.
- Jack, I am so-- - Woman: No.
Oh my God, did you hear that "no"?
Evil, thy name is Ooey.
I forgot too.
I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
Promise me you'll both read this, okay?
I need notes prontito.
I'm having a stage reading Tuesday and I'm a little anxious about it.
- Will: Tuesday, no problem.
- Grace: All right, whatever.
You want to try that one more time with feeling?
- Tuesday, no problem.
- All right, whatever.
Great.
That's the kind of enthusiasm I'm looking for.
Don't forget we're on for Lady Bunny and her All-Boy Revue on Friday.
- Don't blow me off.
- I won't.
If you're gonna think about blowing me off, do not blow me off.
- I won't.
- It's Friday.
Don't blow me off.
"Repetitious and repetitious," said the New York Times.
You queens really do know theatre.
Rosario.
Hi, honey.
Listen, I'm running a little late.
Yeah, things are muey loco at the oficina.
I'm gonna need you to feed the kids and read them something before bedtime.
I don't know, honey, why don't you read 'em that book they love, "Green Eggs And I'm Hammered".
No, Rosario.
Now why would I want to speak to them?
What?
I just-- hola.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Outfit?
- Custom.
- Perfection.
- I know.
- I'm freaking out about my play.
- Honey, come here.
I don't produce theatre.
I am theatre!
Please, Karen, I need your help.
You were so instrumental in the success of my one-man show, "Just Jack".
Remember how nervous I was before "Just Jack"?
But you were there to support me, and coach me, - and make me Just Jack.
- Just shut up!
All right, criminy.
Let me see the material.
"Love Among The Coconuts: A Caribbean Fantasy"?
I dunno, honey.
Sounds like a dessert that repeats.
Tomorrow, I'm casting the role of Plantain, a magnificently built island man who wears nothing but pooka shells and a palm frond.
I'll pick you up.
Grace!
I'm just leaving for work.
- It's 6:00, crazy.
- Oh, I'm late.
So now you're skipping work altogether?
- I called in sick.
- Called who?
You're the boss.
I know.
It was a strange conversation.
If I do it again, I'm gonna fire me.
Grace?
Will, I had to.
Ooey got into a huge fight with Thomas.
- Who's Thomas?
- Her husband!
- Oh, for-- - Oh, it was so good!
She came home, and he was like, "Where have you been"?
And she's all, "I don't have to answer that".
And he's like, "Oh, yes, you do".
And then there was like That sounds even better than "The Real World: Seattle".
I don't want to have this conversation anymore.
- But, Will, I mean-- - No, no-no!
Enough.
No more.
This is wrong, period.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go down to the laundry room.
Never gesture emphatically with a taco in your hand.
- Oliver Wendell Holmes?
- Cesar Romero.
- I just met Judy.
- Who's Judy?
- Ooey is Judy.
- Judy is Ooey?
Yes, it's-- it's truey.
The guy she's having the affair with-- - Dennis.
- Yeah.
Thomas's brother.
No!
Ow.
Yes, yes.
It's ugly, it's sordid.
Move over, I'm in.
Okay, what'd I miss?
It's so tragic.
Her husband is out there saving lives at a hospital, while Slutina flits around the apartment - in a satin robe, having-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, church lady.
First of all, Thomas is a dermatologist.
He's not saving lives, he's popping zits.
And second, he's been checked out of that relationship for two years now.
Trust me, she's gonna leave him for Dennis.
That would be totally immoral.
It would break the commandment about-- coveting thy husband's brother's ass.
Wow, I break that one all the time.
I can't believe you blew me off.
Where the hell were you?
I just spent three hours in the freezing cold outside a drag bar being harassed by a pair of Rosemary Clooneys.
- Why didn't you go in?
- Because you have the tickets.
- Oh.
Sorry.
Right here.
- Oh great.
Thanks a lot.
A lot of good this is gonna do me.
Lady Bunny and her All-Boy Revue have already de-wigged, de-glossed, and de-parted.
Shh, shh, shh.
She's back, she's back.
Did you at least read my play?
- I've been a little busy, Jack.
- Judy: I can't take this anymore.
You tell him, sweetheart.
Wait a minute.
This is your busy?
Trust me, Jack.
It's oddly riveting.
Grace, what about you?
Did you read it?
- Agh-- - Oh, I see.
I guess maintaining the 13 shades of red in your hair keeps you so busy you don't have any time for recreational reading.
Jack, there is a marriage breaking up down there.
- It's kind of important.
- Y-ello?
And I'm not?
Believe me, you'll gain a little perspective next week, when you're, I don't know, studying to be a wet nurse, and you're script is lining the bottom of Guapo's birdcage.
I can't-- w-- would-- did you-- Agh!
Okay.
Okay, that wasn't bad.
I'm not sure if playing coy would be the way to go.
But good job.
Let's start-- oh, excuse me.
Finally, my God, you're here.
I'm a wreck.
I can't get the scene to work, and it's very important.
- I had something important, too.
- I just had a facial at Yolanda's.
I'm sorry.
Yolanda's?
I didn't know.
Oh-- oh, Lord.
Is that one person?
He's auditioning for the part of Plantain.
I thought you wanted an island native, not an island.
He's the only guy that showed up for the audition, and I didn't have the heart to tell him he didn't get the part.
Actually, I didn't have the guts to tell him.
Can you-- All right, I'll take care of it.
Hi.
Listen-- Oh, honey, I think you got a little barbecue sauce, just-- There you go, there you go.
Got it.
Gotta remember to wear a bib when you're eating those dinosaur legs.
I love this.
But, you know, we feel that the character is coming off too-- Jewish.
But listen, thanks for coming down.
Watch the support beam, honey.
We actually ran it a couple times.
He wasn't bad.
If you closed your eyes, he kinda had a Lou Diamond Phillips quality.
It just wasn't working out.
Maybe it was the actor.
Jack, sit down.
Listen, I finished reading your skittle on the treadmill this morning, and you got some bigger problems than your friend King Thong out there.
What are you talking about?
Your play stinks.
It does?
Well, which pages?
The ones with words on them.
"Come to me, Tonga, and let us make lup-lup on my houseboat".
- No, honey, it's not good.
- Karen, it's a Caribbean fantasy.
It's a Caribbean nightmare!
What am I gonna do?
Write about what's important to you-- relationships, your family, your friends.
- I'll take Painful Things for 500.
- Exactly, honey.
Yes!
And when viewed in that light, why, your life is an embarrassment of riches.
Thanks, Karen.
I knew you'd make me feel better.
Oh.
Grace, major development in the vent.
She's cooking him lamb.
Lamb, Grace!
It's so clear.
She's leaving him tonight.
- It's gonna get ugly.
- It's gonna get good!
We need ice cream.
What flavor of ice cream goes with the destruction - of a loveless marriage?
- Rocky road.
No, no, no We have Jack's play tonight.
We have to leave in less than 15 minutes.
That's right.
He's a writer this week.
What are we gonna do?
I wonder if she's started cooking the lamb yet.
About 20 minutes in.
- How do you do that?
- It's a gift.
Now, they're gonna have to start with some wine, right?
He'll have one glass, she'll have 12.
If she plans this right, she'll announce that she's leaving him right after the entree and then use dessert to lift his depression.
Wait, that gives us what?
An hour and a half?
.
We can make an appearance at Jack's play, and be back in time for the tearful breakup sex!
Life is good.
Where's Mr. Kot-ter?
Wow.
I haven't been in a classroom like this since Jimmy Johnson and l-- You know what?
I'm not even gonna finish that sentence.
I'm just gonna have a happy party in my head.
Okay, everybody chop-chop.
In your seats, we're about to begin.
And lights.
Yes.
Hello, my name-- excuse me, you in the capped shirt?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but when the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut, okay?
Thanks, you're a button, okay.
Anyway, my name is Jack McFarland, and tonight I will be showcasing scenes from my new play, "Untitled Jack McFarland Fall Project Entitled: Jack: A Meditation ln Three Parts".
I guess "There's Something About Mary" was already taken.
We open at a funeral.
Not yet!
Jack is dead, the victim of a wayward city bus.
As we begin, his friends arrive to mourn his sudden passing.
Now.
Come on, Will, let's go.
We've been here five minutes.
Come on, Will, let's go.
We've been here five minutes.
Actor Will: Can we go?
Yeah, we've paid our respects.
Besides, our soaps are on.
And I'd rather spend time with imaginary people I don't even know than this sweet dead man who devoted his life to us.
I only read the first few pages, but something tells me this isn't Ieading to the scene where five Laotian houseboys face the pain of adolescence.
- You want to play cards?
- I don't care, whatever.
Okay, five card stud.
Jacks or better to open.
Jack?
I miss him so.
Oh, it's no use.
Everything we do just reminds us of Jack.
If only we'd known this while he was still alive, we would have appreciated him more.
The staging isn't much, but the subtlety of his language-- If only there was something that we could do to be with him again.
Well, there is one thing.
You're right.
We're coming, Jack!
Come on, don't bogart the poison.
What did you do to Jack to make him so mad at you?
Excuse me, I'm not drinking alone up there.
Lights.
We are now in the afterlife.
All right, stand back.
No pushing.
Don't crowd the pearly gates.
We can only let a few of you people in.
All right, you, you, and you.
You, in the acid-washed jeans, you're gonna have to wait a while.
And honey, did you really think you could get into heaven wearing body glitter?
Well, you can't.
No, can't.
Sorry.
- Excuse me?
- Name?
Grace Adler and Will Truman.
You're not on the list.
Is Jack here?
Can we speak to Jack?
Well, he's here, honey, but he's way too busy.
He is huge in heaven.
You know what?
Let me check the other list.
Oh, yeah, Adler and Truman, right on the top.
Wow.
You two are downstairs, where there's lots of vents pushing up a lotta heat.
Okay, enjoy your journey-- to hell!
Cut!
Print!
Tony!
I mean, curtain!
Thank you all for coming, thank you.
Oh my God.
What did we do?
I think it's more what we didn't do.
I gotta talk to him.
Yeah, 'cause if this thing's going to Broadway-- Okay, take care, guys.
Kisses, okay?
Jack?
You guys are going to the cast party, right?
I heard Pacino's gonna be there.
I don't know if that's true or not.
- We're sorry.
- Yeah, well-- I feel terrible.
We didn't pay attention-- - Words, words, words, Will.
- Well, Jack?
What can we do?
What's it gonna take to get us out of hell?
Of all the jackets you've given me tonight, I think-- yeah, this one's the best.
Just needs to be taken in a little around the waist and the hips.
Pretty much everywhere, so-- I still feel kind of funny about listening to them, but in a weird way, it makes me feel better about us.
Yeah.
Whatever problems you and I have, at least I'm not married to a gay guy.
Jack: Missie, I'm gonna need a water bag for this chicken.
Chop-chop.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Good morning.
- Bad morning.
I just found a gray chest hair.
It's so depressing.
I went to bed young, I woke up Ari Onassis.
Jackie!
Get on the boat!
- I'm gonna have to see it.
- Later, when I'm less vulnerable.
- Will, it's one chest hair.
- I only have seven.
I don't like those odds.
Listen to me, Pops.
This isn't about the chest hair.
It's about your birthday next week.
No, it's about the chest hair.
Okay, 90% chest hair, 10% birthday.
- 80-20.
- 60-40.
Sold to the alte cacher in the kitchen.
What do you want to do this year?
I want you to have a fun birthday.
Grace, you know me.
I've never really been that into birthdays.
That's not true.
I've seen all your home movies.
You've had some fun birthdays.
Remember the one where your brothers dressed you up in your mom's clothes?
That seemed like a fun birthday.
That wasn't a birthday.
That was like a Thursday.
So glad my dad captured that one on film.
The only worse thing on film was my eighth birthday party.
You didn't see this one.
I really wanted a cowboy party, you know, like a cowboy cake?
I really loved cowboys.
Still do, by the way.
You don't have to tell me.
I've seen the magazines.
But no, no, no.
My mom gave me a clown party.
Ugh.
I hate clowns.
They think they're so funny.
I just fake-smiled my way through the whole thing, and then when I realized there wasn't gonna be a cowboy cake, I snuck up to my room, and hid.
Oh, Will.
That's so-- "Party Of Five".
What do you want to do this year?
Let's go to a restaurant.
Nothing big, something mellow.
You, me, and Jack.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- You made a face.
- Face?
Hello?
I'm standing right here within face viewing range.
Okay, I don't think Jack likes me.
What are you talking about?
Jack loves you.
No, Jack loves you.
I came along with the deal.
You're the hamburger, and I'm that little cup of coleslaw.
You don't order it, but there it is on the plate.
Gracie, all I want for my birthday is for you and Jack to get along.
Deal.
Let me see it.
- Could be worse.
- How?
How could it be worse?
Oh, come on, Grace!
I'm eating breakfast!
I need you to make a decision for me and I need you to make it now.
Don't have the sex change.
They never work out.
- Jack: Say you're sorry.
- Sorry.
Okay, I've narrowed your birthday festivities down to a couple of choices.
Pick one, - drinks and dancing at The Spear.
- Oh, no.
No, that bar is pure skank.
It's no place to spend my birthday.
It's more like a place to spend your birthday.
Vicious, party of one.
Vicious, party of one.
Okay, second-- and this is the one I'm really pulling for-- you and me on a gay singles weekend cruise.
Kind of a cruise to cruise.
That's where I want to be, on a boat, in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by a 1000 lonely seasick queens weeping into their guacamole.
All right.
You know what, that's it.
I'm done trying.
Make your own kind of music, sing your own special song.
Jack, don't make a big deal.
All I want is a nice little dinner, just you, me and Grace.
What's that?
What's with the face?
I don't like Grace.
What are you talking about?
You like Grace.
I don't know, I'm sort of not into her right now.
Sort of not into her?
She's a person, not tandoori chicken.
What's the problem?
Ever since she's moved in, I never get any me time.
Oh, Jack.
All your time is me time.
Can you try to make a little more effort with Grace, please?
Fine, but for the record, I've made an effort.
Do you think I actually enjoy debating velvet versus velour?
- You love that stuff.
- Hey, I'm not that gay.
Yes, you are.
It's good coffee, hm-mm?
Really good.
Grace, Jack hates flavored coffees, too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Jack, so do l. Will just told me that a minute ago.
You know, guys, my birthday's not for a week.
Let's save some of the merriment till then, huh?
I know what we can do.
Let's get "Entertainment Weekly," and play my favorite new game, - "Love Her, Hate Him".
- I'm gonna watch TV.
You're gonna be missing out.
It's a fun game, Jack.
I know it's fun.
I invented it.
- You hamburger, me coleslaw.
- Come on, Gracie.
It's your turn to be the official page turner-slash-pointer.
Okay.
- Jada Pinkett.
- Hm-mm.
- Hate her.
- Wow, that's kinda harsh.
- She's not really-- - Will, you know the rules, Iove or hate.
No gray area, just like life.
- Hate her.
- Good boy.
This is a fun Friday night.
Love her.
Love, love, love her.
- Who is it?
- Are you serious?
- It's Michelle Kwan.
- Who?
Michelle who?
Michelle Kwan, figure skater, Olympic silver medalist?
Goddess on ice.
- You like Michelle Kwan?
- I love her.
So do l!
- She was so robbed at the Olympics!
- Tell me about it.
She's a billion times better than Tara Lipinski.
Don't even get me started with that little witch.
- She's cocky.
- The cockiest.
- Almost as cocky as Surya Bonaly.
- Oh my God!
- The best!
Surya Bonaly!
- Who?
- Both: Surya Bonaly!
- Jack: She's French.
- She's powerful.
- She's black.
She wears blue eyeshadow, and does illegal backflips.
She scares me.
I crave her.
- Want a cookie?
- Yeah.
Look at you two, huh?
I knew you guys would connect.
Just didn't think it would be over something as lame as ice skating.
Excuse me?
Yeah, excuse me?
What's so lame about ice skating?
Oh, everything.
With the sappy music, the chiffon costumes.
They put little matching fabric booties over their blades.
Grace, I can't believe you're into it.
Oh, but you can believe I'm into it?
Hi, this is Grace Adler of Grace Adler Designs.
I'd like a dinner reservation for three on Tuesday.
It's my best friend's birth-- all booked up?
Would it make a difference if I told you my best friend was Demi Moore?
Believe me, I'm not crazy about her, either.
Okay, bye.
Hi, honey.
Oh, look who's back from lunch just in time for dinner.
Oh, honey, don't tell me.
Tell those slow waiters at Barney's.
What happened?
What went on?
Who stopped by?
What did I miss?
Well, I spent most of the afternoon trying to get a table at a good restaurant for Will's birthday.
Honey, did you try Balthazar?
Karen, Steak and Brew are spitting at me through the phone.
How would get a table there?
Grace, I am your assistant.
- I may not be a whiz at the-- - Computer.
- --or know how to work the-- - Fax.
but, honey, I do know how to get where I need to be.
- Now, hand me the-- - Phone.
I would have gotten that one.
Honey, what's this?
Yeah, who's this?
Uh-huh, well, get me Leanté.
Tell him it's Karen Walker.
Okay, I'm starting to get it.
Oh, yeah, hi, honey.
Listen to me, I need your best table for dinner on-- - Tuesday.
- --Tuesday.
- 9:00.
- 9:00.
- Three people.
- Well, thank you, honey, I would love to come.
- Three.
- Oh, oh, no.
No, wait.
- Will just wanted to have-- - Problem, honey?
Make it four.
Will's friend Jack may come along, as well.
Oh, fun.
Make it four.
Uh-huh.
You, too.
Gotta go.
Yeah.
Leanté, honey, I'm busy.
The French, stinky and blah-hh.
Put down the sports page and listen.
You're only looking at the pictures anyway.
That is not true.
Hey, I'm a sports fan.
I'm a sport-- Iook here, it says right here that the Steelers lost by 17 points to-- to these big guys with the big arms.
Guess where we are having dinner on your birthday?
- Gracie, I don't care where we-- - Balthazar.
Wow, caring a little more.
Great food, cute waiters, the oysters you love!
I love the oysters I love.
How did you get us in?
Karen.
That's why she has to come along with us.
What?
What's with the face?
- Face?
- Hello?
I'm standing right here within face viewing range.
Karen?
I don't really have anything in common with Karen.
I'll cancel.
What am I saying?
It's Balthazar.
It'll be great.
Cute waiters serving the oysters you love.
You suppose I can get the oysters to serve the cute waiters I love?
Smell this.
Is it bad?
It's got 12 more hours.
- How can you know that?
- It's a gift.
You are so gonna be loving me.
You, me, Will, Karen.
Madison Square Garden: Champions On lce.
- No.
- Yes.
- No!
- Yes!
Oh my God!
Champions On lce!
Oh my God!
I've always wanted to go!
- No!
- Yes!
How much are you loving me right now?
!
A lot!
When?
!
When?
!
When are we gonna do this?
!
- Tuesday night.
- When are we-- oh my God!
- Tuesday night!
- Yeah.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
No.
No, wait.
No, it's-- No.
We can't go Tuesday night.
It's Will's birthday.
Oh.
He doesn't care.
He just wants us to get along.
Plus it's a chance to see Rudy Galindo in tights.
No.
I don't want to force Will to do something he doesn't want to do.
Grace, we can go.
I don't care.
No, sweetie, it's okay.
It's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal?
You just jumped into Jack's arms.
The last time a woman did that-- a woman has never done that.
Really, Will?
You're sure?
Then we can go to Balthazar's right after?
Oh my God.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
- You're sure?
- Yes!
Yes, we're going.
You, me, Jack, Karen.
The lce Capades!
- Both: Champions On lce.
- Sorry.
This is a far cry from Balthazar.
Who do I have to tip to get out?
Move!
Legs, legs!
Move!
I'm here.
I can't believe I'm here.
It's all so wonderful.
Pace yourself, Dorothy.
It's the Zamboni machine.
Where's the popcorn guy?
If we're not gonna eat for two hours, I need popcorn.
Well, happy birthday.
Thanks.
Here we are.
Yup, here we are.
Happy b-- oh, we covered that.
So, how old are you?
How old are you?
Grace, honey!
How are we doing over there?
I'm doing great.
Will, you okay?
Can you see?
Much as I need to.
I don't want to get too close, I might get sequin blindness.
Hey!
It's a sport!
People win medals, huh?
I'd like to see you do a double axel, double loop, double lutz, Mr. Man.
Oh, there he is.
- Popcorn!
- Lord, look at these people.
Losers!
Not you.
Karen, you brought champagne?
What are you doing?
You don't drink at Champions On lce.
Honey, don't think of it as drinking.
Think of it as Mommy's little cotton candy.
Will, you don't look like you're having fun.
What are you talking about?
I'm having a great time.
Champions On lce.
Woo!
Let's kick some butt!
What?
You said it was a sport.
Will, honey, maybe a couple of belts of champagne will create the illusion that you're having fun.
Excuse me.
I'm fine.
Really, I just want a little popcorn.
-  - Hey, popcorn!
Oh my God.
- I'm getting chills.
- Will: Here he comes.
Hey!
Excuse me!
He didn't hear me.
Honey, I don't care.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please welcome the Champions On lce!
There they are, skating in the dark.
- I think I see Surya.
- Don't tease me.
Two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko!
Hey!
Popcorn!
Look at him!
You wear those leather pants, Elvis!
And United States Champion Rudy Galindo!
Hey!
He's my hero!
He's the gay one!
One?
Up here, Rudy!
Will, you don't seem like you're into this ice crap either.
Not particularly, but Grace and Jack love it so much, I just wanted them to have a good time.
But, honey, it's your birthday.
- How about now?
- Okay, now.
Yup, we get it, Surya.
You can skate.
How much longer is Champions On lce?
You mean Endless On lce?
Pretty soon, I'd better be looking at some oysters on ice.
I am starving.
Skate faster!
We have reservations!
You're hating this, aren't you?
Do you want to just go?
No, no, no.
You guys are having fun.
That's all I want.
That and maybe a little popcorn!
Are you sure?
'Cause if you're not, then-- What?
!
What?
!
What, did I miss a backflip?
!
No, no, no.
Triple toe, double loop.
No flip yet.
Maybe she won't do it.
No, she's gonna do it.
She didn't come all the way from France to not flip.
- Vendor: Popcorn!
- Yes, popcorn!
I've been calling you for like an hour.
So you were the one.
I thought it was the 49,000 other people that are in here.
You don't have any brie and crackers in that thing, do you?
I'm warming your brie right now, lady.
- Vendors.
- Oh, this is like ancient.
It's typical.
My birthday.
Can't get what I want.
Never do.
One year, I wanted this cool red fire engine.
My mother got me a Water Wiggle.
Decided it'd be more fun to slip and slide.
More fun for who?
Backflip, backflip.
- God, she faked us out.
- Hello!
You just knocked the popcorn out of my hand!
I'm sorry, honey.
I'll get you another one.
- Popcorn!
- I don't want another popcorn!
- I want that popcorn!
- Popcorn!
Grace, Grace, she's gonna do it.
Took me two hours to get that guy's attention.
- Jack: Grace, just-- - It is my birthday.
You'd think I could get a little attention on my birthday!
- Will?
- Grace, Grace-- Uh-huh, oh, yeah, uh-huh, oh, yeah.
Okay, and where did her legs go?
Over her head!
Okay, you have to admit that that was pretty da-- Will?
- Where did Will go?
- Oh, he left, honey.
He left?
What, are you insane?
You're gonna miss Rudy.
Honey, where are you going?
Don't leave me here with these ice freaks!
Honey, this shirt on you is heaven.
Grace: Will?
Will?
All right, so I think I've got it now.
When I ask and you say okay, and then I ask and you say okay, and then I ask and you say okay, it's really a cue to me to know that it's not okay.
You see how easy it is?
All right, just so we're clear.
- You're insane.
- I must be.
Every year, I end up doing what I don't want to do in order to make everybody else happy.
I'm still an eight-year-old-- an eight-year-old with gray chest hair.
One.
One gray chest hair.
Actually, none.
I tweezed it this morning.
It was taunting me.
Jack: Hello?
Hello?
Hi, guys.
Yeah, I just came by to get my-- oh, here it is-- "Entertainment Weekly" magazine.
Oh my God, what is that?
A Rudy Galindo autograph?
Well, I'll be a rat's ass.
How did that get there?
What'd you do, sign it yourself?
.
Didn't have to.
- Should I wait downstairs or what?
- Grace: Oh my God.
Rudy Galindo.
Rudy and I are gonna go for coffee and-- Oh, happy birthday.
He does not look 46.
Lotta work.
Well, another memorable birthday for the books.
- Goodnight.
- Excuse me, mister.
Your birthday's not over yet.
What did you tell me you wanted more than anything when you were a little boy?
You don't have a "Josie and the Pussycats" Iunchbox in there?
Happy birthday, partner.
My cowboy cake!
- Look at him.
- Do you love it?
I love it so much I'm gonna sleep with it.
Whatever gets you through the night.
You know, you're not eight years old anymore.
You can ask for what you really want.
- All right, next year-- - Mm-hmm?
I want a real cowboy.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
So I go back in the bookstore this morning and I just ask him out.
Good for you, Jack.
You actually got a date without the use of a modem and the cybername "Butt Masterson".
At least I'm using my hard drive, Celibizia.
It was kind of romantic, though.
Our hands touched as we reached for a copy of "The Making Of Beaches".
Holy dirty apartment, Fatman!
Yeah.
Amazing, isn't it?
You can practically feel the presence of Fred Sanford hovering above us.
Shut up, dummy!
So what happened in here?
Did Grace explode?
No.
It's the annual Sublime Design Showcase.
Interior designers display their work for all these big design critics, and basically they decide who's hot and who's not.
It's insanely competitive, and every year she takes a stab at it and never wins.
She's the Susan Lucci of the design world.
So we need to be really sensitive to that, okay?
You know, I can't-- There's no-- It won't-- I'm sleeping!
Wake me never!
Looks like it's gonna be another disappointing year for La Lucci.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, good!
You're back!
Here, smell this.
Stinks, doesn't it?
You were probably riding up in the elevator thinking, "What died"?
Well, don't worry.
It's just my creativity rotting and stinking in my skull.
So you've had coffee?
Then I started poppin' NoDoz.
- Now I'm hating myself really fast.
- Yeah.
So I'm guessing the chocolate covered espresso beans were a bad idea.
Oh, no-no.
No-no-no.
Give that to me.
Maybe I can get so speedy, I'll actually go back in time.
You know, to when I was actually good.
Grace, look at this.
This is good.
Oh-- horrible.
But you know what?
I think I have finally pinpointed my problem.
- I suck.
- Grace you know how to do this.
Yeah, when I am helping other people realize what they want.
But when it's just me, nothing.
I mean, I'm like one of those weird fish that you always see swimming next to the ass of a shark.
That almost worked, didn't it?
You were going for a whole parasite thing.
I was with you.
The point is -  - l have no vision.
Grace, you have vision.
Are you so blind you can't see that?
Hi.
I'm-- I'm April.
The service sent me.
Oh, great.
I'm Will.
- And uh - Hi.
that mess over there is Grace.
Grace?
This is gonna cheer you up.
A short brunette woman?
Come on, Will.
I tried that in college.
Remember, it really wasn't my thing.
Well, I hope you have your own cleaning supplies 'cause I'm not packin'.
Little industry joke.
Oh, that's a little industry laugh.
Under the sink.
Huh?
- Will, what is this?
- I got you a cleaning woman.
I know you can only work when things are neat and clean and orderly.
Uh, no, Anal Annie, that's you!
It'll blow my vibe having someone puttering around while I'm trying to work.
Excuse me, what vibe are we blowing here?
You've been up for three days and all you've drawn is an outline of your hand, made into a turkey.
It was supposed to be a cow.
- See, I told you I suck!
- No, honey, it's-- Look, see, it's a cow.
All right, look.
I've gotta go.
She'll do her thing, she'll stay out of your way.
You do yours and if you hit a rough spot, just-- It's easy, just think of your mother's taste, you know, and then go the other way.
Uh, excuse me.
This was crumbled up on the floor.
You didn't want to throw this out, did you?
Oh, uh, that's just um that's garbage.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.
Looks pretty good to me.
What is it?
It's a meditation room.
It was an early, tragic idea.
No, actually, the pop-up bidet was tragic.
This is just bad.
Bad, bad, bad.
Oh, God.
Hey, hey.
Come on, get up.
Let me show you something I learned in the Coast Guard.
Come on.
- Up-up-up.
- No, no.
No-no-no, come on, get up.
Shhh First, you close your eyes.
Then you get to a really quiet place.
Breathe in.
Calm and serene.
You're peaceful.
And let it out.
You know, when we met at the bookstore, I have to say, I would never have guessed that you were a lawyer.
Probably 'cause I look so young.
Actually, I passed the bar the first time I took it, and um, funny story, John-John was taking it the same day I was.
For the third time.
And what do you know, I mean, he just sits right down next to me, and this time, he passes.
Uh, I'm not gonna say anything else.
You're a smart guy, Alex.
You connect the dots.
So what kind of law do you practice?
I don't practice, I just do.
But I don't want to talk about me anymore.
You're out of order.
So how's grad school?
Right now it's not bad.
I mean, I'm working on my dissertation, and every now and then I get to meet a cute intellectual type at a bookstore.
You do?
Oh, me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Of course, me the brainiac.
Smarties love to staple.
- Excuse me?
- Will, you're here.
Uh, well, it's about time.
You call yourself an assistant?
!
Actually, no.
I wouldn't either, given the way you just abandoned the phones like that.
Alex, this is my assistant, Will.
Will, I'm a lawyer and this is Alex.
From the bookstore?
- Oh, hi, Alex.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late, Iawyer McFarland.
The sign out front with your name on it must have fallen down.
I've been looking everywhere for it.
Right, uh, get that fixed immediately.
Gotta give him somethin' to do.
Alex, will you give me and Will a minute, please?
- We gotta go over some uh-- - Torts?
Uh, no, thanks.
We're gonna go for Chinese.
You know, I'll just-- I'll wait out front.
- Nice to meet you, Will.
- You, too.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad, don't be mad.
Just listen.
I had to tell him I was something.
I mean, he calls me today and wants to meet me in my office for lunch.
How hot is that?
Must be nice to have finally met someone that likes you for who you are.
Yeah, it's nice, but listen.
Please don't say anything.
I promise I'll tell him.
I've just got to find the right moment.
Oh, maybe during lunch, you know, when he finds out that McFarland can't afford the McNuggets because he's a McLiar.
- I hate myself.
- Of course you do, honey.
How could anybody be happy in bat mitzvah ruffles?
Why don't you run home and change, hmm?
I think we'll both feel better.
I'm gonna have a quick cry in the swatch room.
Honey, you still test-driving those anti-depressants?
'Cause I think it's time to buy.
Am I in the right place, Grace Adler Designs?
Right place, wrong outfit.
What's it all about, honey?
What's-- Well, I'm-- I'm April, Grace's cleaning lady.
Cleaning la-- Honey we shouldn't be talking.
Get to work.
Start with that big table there.
There's a phone in there somewhere.
It's been ringin' all morning.
It's driving me nuts.
- April, what are you doing here?
- Oh, you didn't leave the key for me.
Oh, gosh.
Sorry.
Here it is.
Hey hey hey hey hey, what are you doin'?
You're giving the maid a key?
You're gonna be buying your jewelry back from hobos.
Karen, why don't you go to lunch?
- Honey, it's 10:00 in the morning.
- In Boston.
Honey, that is so-- Eh-- okay.
Oh, great, you're working on that piece you threw out yesterday.
Yup, seeing if I can make it worse.
I think I did it.
Yup, designed a meditation room that could move the Dalai Lama to bitch-slap Richard Gere.
Yawn.
- Excuse me?
- You're boring.
I hate people getting down on themselves.
You'd get down on yourself, too, if you had a-- If what?
lf I had your talent?
Uh-uh.
When I'd get down on myself, my mom had this saying that always made me feel better.
Let me see how she put it.
Let see if I can get it right.
Agh!
Your mother wasn't Sam Kinnison by any chance, was she?
Well, what does it say on your door?
It doesn't say "Grace Adler Whines," it says "Grace Adler Designs," so quit beating yourself up and just do it.
- But I can't-- - Do it!
Do it!
Okay, okay.
You know, Mary Poppins got the same message across, but she did it in a nice little musical number.
You're like-- you're like a spoonful of whup-ass.
You know what I can do?
I could add the element of scent-- an aromatherapy machine that would-- Tsk, stupid.
People will think - Agh!
- l'm brilliant.
God, can't we just trade her in for a buzzer?
'Morning, ladies Karen.
Okay, you bring April to work once, I can accept that.
Twice, no problem.
I can fold my own socks, but five days a week?
I've got mold on my shower curtain that is in escrow.
Will, I can't explain it, but whenever she's around, I get the most amazing ideas.
Will, you have to trust me on this.
I can't do this without her.
Let me get this straight.
You can't design without our maid?
- Exactly.
- Yeah.
No, I've heard about this.
It's called the Hazel Syndrome.
Yeah.
They'll explain it all to you in the nervous hospital, Blanche.
"Yeah, these fingernails'll have to be trimmed".
You're a brilliant designer.
Why do you need this?
I just do.
Why can't you be a little more supportive about it?
Okay, here's me being supportive: Grace, you're a little--  Okay?
You're relying on our maid to do your job.
Did Mr. Brady ask Alice to help with the architecture?
!
I've got your number, sister.
I've seen "All About Eve".
- Who?
- "Poor Eve".
Yeah, that's right, go ahead.
Play the poor, naive little maid with the heart of gold.
But I've got Grace's back!
Trust me, you're not going to win the Tony in this version.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I just want to help Grace.
Oh you're good.
Get up, get up, get up, get up!
He's gonna be here any minute.
- Who?
- Don't play games with me!
Alex.
Come on, Will, he's the one.
I'm sure of it this time.
I thought Robert was the one.
Robert was cute.
I should call him.
Get up, get up!
I thought you were gonna tell Alex that you are not a lawyer.
I lied.
Forgive me.
I was in character.
Why should I do this?
Look at me, Will.
Think of how many funny little Jack stories you can spin out of this predicament.
This is grade-A fodder for a bitch like you.
Have a seat, boss.
- Okay, how do I look?
- Great.
Who'd have thought that you could put clothes on that fast?
Amazing.
Excuse me, Mr. Lawyer, is this your bike lock?
Excuse me, can I just be alone in my office for a minute please?
Sure.
No, I just thought, you know, with your bike lock here and your bike out there, as a good assistant, I should mention that.
Damn it!
Oh!
Alex!
Kill time!
So much fodder, so little time.
Alex, come on in.
Jack's just locking up a deal.
He'll be-- he'll back in.
So-- what's uh, Jack like as a boss?
Imperious.
Very much the queen bee.
Oh, Alex, what a surprise.
Uh, I'm a little out of breath.
Oh?
Hung jury?
You're a pig, get out.
Oh, the pants.
Uh, yeah, I'm just uh, running from case to case.
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.
Great, let me just check my call sheet and we'll grab a little lunch.
Actually, I just want to talk to you.
Uh, listen, Jack.
You're a great guy, but-- I'm getting the "great guy, but" speech, huh?
It's just that you and I are in such different places in our lives.
I'm kinda lost and aimless.
I've got a new job every couple of weeks.
You're like this buttoned up professional-- stable, mature, goal-oriented, responsible.
Oh, no.
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a liar.
Jack, it's not gonna work out.
All right, I see.
Then I think you should go.
I've got a lot on my plate right now, and I'd probably break your heart.
- Anyway-- - Listen, one more thing.
It's a little awkward, but I wondered if you could fix me up with your assistant.
My as-- Will?
- No - I mean, he just seem a little lost Iike me, and l-- I kind of like that.
He's straight.
Where is she?
Where is April?
"Poor Eve".
Would you stop doing that?
She knows it's this evening.
Where could she be?
I can't say that I'm surprised.
I mean, you can take the maid out of the house, but you can't take the Karen, if this is you helping, stop helping.
Well, l-- You know what those rocks need?
A little Scotch.
Listen, Grace, l I just wanted to point out that after all of your "April this" and "April that," who is here for you in your hour of need?
Me.
Huh?
And who will always be there for you?
Huh, what?
Oh?
Oh, yeah, it's me.
Thank you, Karen.
- I really appreciate it.
- Anyway, look, I gotta run.
I got a salt scrub in an hour.
This is wrong.
It's all wrong.
And you, you are so wrong there.
Talking to pillows?
Wow, you're like the Doctor Doolittle of furniture.
What are you doing?
We had five different options for a floor plan.
April was supposed to be here early so we could agree on one.
I've had to do it all by myself, and look, look.
It's crap.
- It's fantastic.
- Oh, what do you know?
Well, maybe a little bit more than the maid.
I am gay, after all.
Maybe I should try the second choice.
- Help me move the Tansu chest.
- No.
Grace, what are you doing?
Just leave it.
It's gonna look better over here.
Would you leave it where it is?
Stop it!
Why do I feel like I'm in a shooting gallery?
Ach!
Screens?
What was I thinking?
It's like a bad Chinese restaurant.
Okay, getting a little angry here in the meditation room.
- Is that what you were going for?
- If you want to help me, you will get April on the phone.
Well, you can stop saying that because she's not coming.
- How do you know?
- Because I paid her not to come.
- What?
- You don't need her, Grace.
You did this whole room yourself.
You paid April not to come?
Oh my-- Okay, Will, tell me.
How much does my public humiliation go for these days?
for a free mop.
Look, you're being ridiculous.
She didn't do anything, except go "Agh"!
Oh, don't you dare mock the "Agh"!
I have no connection to the "Agh"!
You resent the "Agh"!
- You fear the "Agh"!
- Okay, look.
I'm gonna stop doing this right now, because frankly, it's a little embarrassing.
You're brilliant.
I've told you this all week long, but for whatever reason, you won't listen to me.
Will, you are wrong!
This isn't good!
- Actually, he's right.
- Oh, who the hell are you?
I'm the design critic from "East Coast Living".
Welcome to my meditation space.
Well, congratulations.
You kicked boo-tay.
Say it, "I kicked boo-tay".
I kicked booty.
I think now I sense you're going to thank me.
Uh, no, because actually, I'm still mad at you.
No, correction.
You want to be mad at me, but you can't, because: A) I was right; but B) this meditation room is just too good.
Peace.
Oneness.
Om.
Thank you.
Om.
Let's go home.
Why home?
There's a rock in my bum.
At least it's not your thumb.
Now it's going numb.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I just met the cutest guy at the video store, shamelessly flirting with me through his girlfriend, but I picked up on it.
- What movie did you get?
- "Star Wars".
Oh, again?
Jack, I'm dreaming of Jabba the Hutt.
That's 'cause you live with him.
Anyways, I'm collecting data to put on the internet.
The world should know the truth about C-3PO.
Jack, C-3PO is not gay, he's British.
Oh, R2.
Come back here.
My circuits burn for you.
You really should get another hobby besides outing robots.
He thinks every robot is gay.
Uh, hello?
"Lost ln Space"?
"Danger, danger, Will Robinson".
Big space queen.
- Oh, I'll get it.
- No.
We're screeners.
You don't screen when I call, do you?
- No no, no - Never.
Grace on machine: Hi, we're not in.
Leave a message at the tone.
-  - Woman: Hi, Grace.
You should change your message.
Have a little fun, like-- We're Will and Grace and we're not home, So leave a message on the phone Scooba-doo-biz-ah-doo-wah, oh yeah.
Oh, I just made that up.
Anyhoo, I'm coming to the Grand Apple for a few days It's the Big Apple.
l'll see you when I get in, honey.
Bye.
Who the hell was that nut?
That nut was my mother.
"Danger, danger, Grace Adler".
- Will, let's go over it again.
- Gracie, I think you're ready.
Will, my mother's coming in without my father, a.k.a. the buffer.
I need to be prepared.
Okay, mother shield up.
Judgment deflector activated.
Fire away.
Honey, I'm just so thrilled about you and your little pillow store, but did I tell you the Schenectady Times said that my performance in "Rent" stole the show!
Well, I'm not surprised.
I mean, look at you, Mom.
You were born to play an adolescent struggling with homelessness and heroin addiction.
And uh, by the way, that little pillow store is actually a thriving enterprise--  Getting a very high hostility reading.
God, oh God, I'm goin' down.
She-- she's gonna nail me.
I could-- I bet you, within the first five seconds, - she's gonna be all over my-- - Hair?
Nails?
No.
Okay, this is a little too much fun for you.
- Love life?
- No, stop it!
She's gonna say that I'm ruining my life, that I'm never gonna meet anyone because I'm living with a gay guy.
A gay guy?
ls he cute?
- Not at the moment.
-  Okay, deep breath.
Chin up.
You always part your hair like that?
I'm kidding, the hair is good.
You'll be swell, you'll be great!
You can have the whole world on a plate!
Will, I think my mother's here.
Come on, darling.
Give mother a hug.
Mmm, you look gorgeous.
Change the shoes.
Shoes?
How could I miss that?
Is it my imagination, or do you get handsomer and handsomer?
No, it's true.
I get handsomer by the minute.
I've got time-lapse photos that would amaze you.
Grace, Grace, how do you like my new suit?
Look, look, look, no panty line, because no panties.
Oh, there was just no preparing for that one.
Mmm, mini-muffins.
They think they're so cute.
Hmm.
Someone sent those to the house for Rosario, but she's in the hospital having her stomach stapled, so I don't think she'll be needing them.
Your maid is having her stomach stapled?
No, honey, I'm having her stomach stapled.
Good morning, good morning.
Come on, girls.
Jump in.
Ma, there's no singing here.
It's great to stay up late-- Both: Good morning, good morning to you.
Woo!
Mmm, honey, I love you.
Oh, honey, so do l. Oh, let's go shopping.
We'll spend your dowry.
Might as well put it to some use.
All right.
Okay, Mom, but before we go, get it out.
What?
What you've been dying to tell me ever since you got here.
Oh, let's see, I did the uh-- I did the office, I did the shoes What'd I leave out?
Oh, um, hair, make-up, combination skin Hello?
You work for me.
That's what I'm doin', honey.
Honey, just tell me what you want me to criticize, and I'll do it.
I want you to be happy.
Okay, Mom, uh, you want to tell me that I should get my own place because I'm wasting my life and my time living with a gay man, so come on, tell me.
And why would I say that?
Will's great.
I think you should live with Will as long as you want.
Okay, I don't know what kind of sick game you're playing, lady, but I want no part of it.
There's no game, dear.
I love Will.
As a matter of fact, what would really make me happy is if the two of you got married.
I'd like to see that one.
Wait, wait.
What?
Mom?
Mom, Will is gay.
Oh, I know that.
I'm in the theatre.
That's why it's so perfect.
You know, how long do you think the sex thing is going to last?
Hmm?
You see, the best relationship ends up like the two of you are now, good friends.
So jump in.
I think a June wedding.
I'd like to go strapless.
Well, that would certainly fit in with no panties.
- Mom, you're insane.
- Why?
You know, I think that you may even have topped the time that you came on to my prom date as Zsa Zsa Gabor.
Oh, but darling, I adored his ruffled shirt.
Ladies and gentlemen, fresh from 45 minutes of buttrobics, I give you my ass.
You must be Jack.
And you must be-- Bobbi Adler?
Of course.
Fabuloso Jewess from Schenectady.
Loving you!
Loving your whole tribe.
Come here.
- Ooh-- - Gimme a kiss.
Oh-- Uh, well, we'll start with that.
Anybody want to touch, feel, poke?
Caress?
Only if I can get a Silkwood scrub-down afterwards.
I'll take a shot.
Oh, you've done this before, haven't you?
Okay, that just bought me five years on the couch.
Come on, honey, we'll go shopping, and we'll get you a nice yellow blouse, on me.
And since I hate yellow, that's exactly where it'll end up, on you.
Ooh, free food.
Well, thank God they're gone.
Listen, Jack, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
- It's kind of important.
- I'm all ears, - and one high butt.
- Yeah.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story.
A few weeks ago, it was Stan's birthday, and I forgot to get him a present.
I mean, how am I supposed to remember something like that?
Anyway, long story short, I think I might be pregnant.
Oh, Karen, l-- I hope you don't forget my birthday.
Okay, boys, last card.
Down and dirty.
And feel free to come down and get me dirty sometime.
Hah!
Gin!
Well, I'll be darned, that is gin.
It's too bad the rest of us are playing poker.
Yeah, that is too bad.
No, Karen, we're all playing poker, even you.
Wow.
The gays really love their rules.
Whadya got, Jack?
One pair of fabulous cheeks.
Oh I got nothin'.
Well, read 'em and weep, ladies.
Full house, aces over 10s.
Oh, poor little old me, and all I have is these little twos.
- Oh.
- Four of these little twos.
Mother Adler wins again.
I think I'll gonna have a drink.
Who's with me?
Martini, honey.
And don't waste any space with those olives.
Hang on.
She'll have a ginger ale.
Karen, we talked about this.
Jack, I don't even know if I'm-- yet.
When are you gonna take the-- Look, Mummenschanz, I don't want to take that test, okay?
Honey, have you found yourself in a family way?
Oh, no-no-no.
But I think I might be pregnant.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
Yeah, join the club.
You know, honey, I think I liked you better with your hair straighter.
Ching ching.
Right off the Mom shield.
Miss Kitty there is winning back your college tuition.
Honey, would you tell him about the time I played poker with that Neil Farber and left him nothing but his skivvies?
She left Neil Farber with nothing but his skivvies.
Okay, everyone up to speed on that one?
Good.
Oh, by the way, Will, guess what Mrs. Bobbi Adler, the loin of my fruits, suggested to me this afternoon?
Um, "Stop calling me the loin of your fruits"?
No, honey.
She said that you and Grace should get married.
Grace and me?
Married.
- It was just a suggestion.
- I think it's a wonderful idea.
She'll make such a beautiful bride.
Grace, you'll look pretty, too.
Yeah, this would be us three weeks in.
- Honey, I'm having an affair.
- Me, too.
- His name is Donald.
- Me, too!
Can't you just hear it?
"Will, you may now kiss the beard".
I mean, it's so absurd.
Even if I was straight, I wouldn't marry Grace.
What did Will mean by that?
I mean, if I were gay, I would marry him.
I mean, if I were a gay man and I lived in Amsterdam or ancient Greece.
And-- you know what I mean.
Well, honey, maybe you're just needy.
When you're with a man, what you need to do is to find out - Oh, no, no, no - he-- he-- Thank you.
Anything but relationship advice from you.
- Why?
- Ladies, are you ready to order?
Uh, I'm not-- I'm not eating.
- And your sister?
- Sister?
Well, honey, I mean, I love you.
I'll have an order of you to go.
Why don't I give you ladies a few minutes to decide?
All right, that's cute, cute.
Why won't I take your advice?
That's why.
What was I gonna do?
lgnore him?
He was flirting with him.
It's my youthful skin.
It's the only thing that dreadful grandmother of yours gave me.
Mom?
Mom, what I'm trying to say to you is that you always need to be the center of attention, in a restaurant, in your marriage.
You always have to be the star.
God cast me in the role.
You know, Will has a theory about relationships.
One person in the gardener, who tends, and the other person is the flower, who gets tended to.
And, Mom, I say this with love, you're a big stinkin' rose.
Sorry, ladies.
My turn to be late.
No, you're just in time.
My daughter's hating me for lunch.
- Ah.
- I don't hate you.
I hate you.
This is gonna be a pleasant lunch.
What's everybody having?
I'm not eating, my mother's having the snapper, and why the hell wouldn't you marry me?
!
Can I at least have a bread stick first?
Why wouldn't you marry me?
You're just not my type of woman.
Okay, I prefer someone taller and uh, with a hairy chest.
It's funny.
Well, ignore me.
Keep going.
You said specifically that if you were straight, you wouldn't marry me, and I'm just curious as to why, huh?
Why, huh?
All right.
I'm not gonna talk to you when you're like this, okay?
Okay, okay.
You're right, you're right.
I'm-- I'm just overreacting.
But I really think it would be good for me to know, so so please, tell me.
It's nothing.
It's nothing to do with our relationship.
It has more to do with the way you are with your boyfriends.
Do you really want to discuss this in front of your mother?
Please, I used to take her temperature in the tushy.
Nothing shocks me.
Just ignore me.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- How am I with my boyfriends?
- Huh, you know how you are.
Will, obviously, I don't.
How am l?
- Will?
- Okay, you have a tendency-- You kind of need to be the star of your relationships.
You know, it's all about your stuff.
Your boyfriends are like gardeners, and you're sort of like No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Do not call me a flower.
I am not a flower.
I am a gardener, damn it.
I do plenty of hoeing.
That's just what a mother likes to hear.
Okay, okay.
You know what?
I think I am just-- I am done with this lovely lunch.
I do not have to sit here and be criticized and insulted by my best friend.
That is why my mother is in town.
Grace, you asked me a question.
You are describing the wrong person at this table.
I am giving and nurturing and loving and selfless with my boyfriends.
I, Will Truman, am no star.
-  - Oh.
- Oh, that's 15 minutes.
- Yeah.
So uh, if the stick is blue, we're pregnant.
Well, nothin' doin' on mine.
- Karen?
- Well, nothing here, either.
Well, thank God for that.
- Oh-- - You okay?
Okay?
Oh, honey, I'm relieved.
I can't have a kid right now.
We just recarpeted.
Well, you know, I knew there'd be nothing on mine.
I mean, I'm not insane.
It's just-- Still, I'm a little sad.
Oh, honey.
Well, here, take my platinum.
Charge yourself a little happy.
No, thanks.
I'll just hit the gym and work out some of these feelings and my delts.
Uh, don't hate me for doing this, but-- I love you.
Hello, Stan?
Hi.
Put your kids on, I want to talk to them.
Eh-- yes, I'm serious!
Grace's voice: "April 16, 1980: Dear Diary, Well, tonight was really my night.
Adam and I won best couple at the Hawthorne Junior High Prom.
Adam looked like Adam, but everyone said I looked like Debbie Harry, only prettier and with red hair.
How psyched am l"?
Ew.
"June 5, 1995: Tonight was really my night.
Danny got promoted to vice president of his investment firm.
At the company dinner, everyone told him how lucky he is to have a girlfriend like me.
I'm so proud of him.
I love the dress that I wore.
And my new shoes-- ooh-la-la".
How did I get like this?
Well, tonight was really my night.
I was walking down Columbus, and these kids were shooting a commercial about I don't know what.
It was juice or pants or something.
Anyway, they put me in it.
Your mother's gonna be on TV.
They even gave me a line-- "It's chew-rrific".
I'm guessing it wasn't pants.
Look, Grace, I know that you've been sitting in here ever since lunch, scared to death about turning into me.
No.
I already know I'm you.
What I'm scared of is what that means for my romantic life.
I can't even get a gay guy to hypothetically marry me.
Let me tell you something, dear.
I joke about your father, but I love him.
You can ask him any time, day or night, who is the love of his life, and he'll say, "I married her.
Move over, you're blockin' the TV".
Maybe you just got really lucky.
No.
No, I'm not lucky.
I'm terrific.
And you're terrific, Grace.
Oh, honey, you are a wonderful woman.
Grace, embrace who you are.
I'm sorry, I must be in the wrong apartment.
What's going on?
What's the matter with you, Will?
How could you not marry my daughter?
Um, I'm gay?
Well, that's not the point.
Where else could you be lucky enough to find a girl like this?
Because gardener, flower, star, co-star, call it whatever you want to, it works for us Adler girls.
- Oh, oh-- okay, Mom.
- Oh, dear.
- Uh, in the hair.
- I'm sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry, darling.
Oh, well, I'm late for my manicure.
We'll meet for dinner at 8:00.
Oh, that reminds me of a song.
She gets too hungry for dinner at 8:00
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Okay, let's do this quickly while Jack's still playing on the escalator.
Okay, how about a juicer for Jack's birthday?
That's a good idea.
Then maybe he can give ours back.
Here, try some.
It's liquid sunshine.
Mmm.
It is liquid sunshine.
How'd you do it?
With the Schmenkman 5000, you can make juice out of anything.
Oh, come on!
I'm sure the Schmenkman 5000 is good, but can it really get juice out of anything?
Ma'am, the Schmenkman 5000 is so good, you could get juice out of Hume Cronyn.
Now, that's a good juicer.
- Are we gonna get this or what?
- I don't know.
Hey, look.
I'm Cher, circa 1978.
My daughter's a what?
Wait a minute.
Why are you guys buying my birthday present in here?
No, no-no.
I don't need kitchen appliances.
I eat all my meals at your house.
Doy.
Oh my God, and do not get me a juicer.
I just sold the one I had.
Um this birthday party we're throwing for you, - it's still a surprise, right?
- Oh my God, totally.
But I want to go over the guest list.
And I want a celebrity-- no one lower than Joan Van Ark.
How about Joan of Arc?
What show was she on?
Okay, anyways, let's goes next door and get some CD's.
I want to get some surprise party music for my surprise party.
I heard the new Alanis Morissette just got reduced.
Yeah, that's what you get for thanking lndia.
Are you looking for a juicer?
Oh, l I really don't know.
Well, this one is terrific.
You know, they claim it can get juice out of-- Hume Cronyn, yeah.
Hume Cronyn?
He's a national treasure.
That's not funny.
See, the guy that just left, he was the one who-- I'm gonna need a few more minutes.
Hi, I'm Mr. Juicer.
My God, Grace Adler, you have gotten lonely.
- Sam?
- Hi, Grace.
Oh my God, Sam?
What are you doing here?
Well, I woke up this morning and I realized that I have lived my entire life without one of these.
- A juicer?
- No, a kitchen.
Grace Adler, wow.
You know, the last time I saw you, you were this big.
But I was on a hill and you were far away.
- How are you?
- Good.
You know, I did the interior of a house that you were the contractor on in Sag Harbor.
- Really?
How'd you like my work?
- Fantastic.
I loved the way you put the floor down low where everybody walks.
And-- and whose idea was it to put the ceiling - above everyone's head like that?
- That was mine.
Thank you.
So how long are we not gonna talk about what we're not talking about?
Oh, I can do this all day.
I have a lot of staying power.
You look great.
So I guess I'll start.
Will just left.
Well, he always had good timing.
Sam, he's right next door picking out CDs.
Go catch him, before he buys "The Best Of Bread".
Hey, you know, that's a great idea, except he hates me.
Sam, he doesn't hate you any more than you hate him.
Grace, I don't hate him.
I love him.
I miss him.
Okay, he hates you a little more than you hate him.
But one of you has to make the first move.
It could be either one-- as long as it's you.
You know, Grace, I can't.
I gotta go meet an architect in about 10 minutes, but I'd love to talk to you about this.
I'm staying at The Mercer.
- Would you please call me?
- Do you want me to tell Will anything?
Tell him tell him his brother misses him.
Where are the measuring spoons?
- You know what?
- Hmm?
Maybe you want to put down your little sippy cup and help me make Jack's cake.
Well, honey, all you had to do was ask.
I'm happy to help.
Rosario?
Yeah Hi, honey.
I'm gonna need you to make one of your seven-layer cakes for tomorrow.
Mm-hm.
And keep an eye on the kids.
The fat one's gonna go right for the bowl.
Yeah.
Okay, hola.
Baking is fun.
- Hey.
- Grace: Hi.
What'd you end up getting Jack?
I've narrowed it down to something spandex with padding.
So we're gonna get him Richard Simmons?
Oh my God.
Do you know what he would love?
Oh, what is that deal down in the Mediterranean, where you can charter a yacht with another couple for a week?
You know, a seven-person crew.
They take you up the ltalian Riviera.
Oh, what is the name of that boat?
Oh, I know.
The SS Lower Your Dosage.
What are you guys doing up here?
We're making a cake from scratch, and I helped.
- Hey, I've got some big news.
- Yeah?
Remember when you selfishly bailed on me at the store and left me to buy a birthday present for you to give your friend?
Yeah, that was right after I thoughtfully split up the workload, so you could make your manicure on time.
It was right about that time.
Anyway, 30 seconds after you left Sam Truman walks up to me.
Ooh, old lover?
Sam Truman?
My brother?
So no?
- Will, he really misses you.
- Mmm, I'll bet.
I'm gonna change, and go to the gym.
- Maybe you should call him.
- Hey, maybe I shouldn't.
Will.
Call your brother.
You know, Michael Corleone forgave Fredo.
Yeah, that was right before he had him taken out to the lake and shot.
Yeah, but the important thing is he forgave him.
No, I think the important thing to Fredo was that he got shot.
Go back to your baking.
Agh!
This is so stupid.
Five years ago, Will told Sam he hated the woman he was gonna marry, and as a result, Sam cut Will out of his life completely.
And they were-- they were so close.
And now, finally-- - finally Sam seems ready-- - Honey, honey I barely care about Will.
Can you imagine how I feel about the brother?
Damn it, honey.
I was hoping there'd be at least one straight guy here tonight in case these puppies accidentally fall out.
Whoops!
Woo!
- Party's goin' pretty well, huh?
- Yeah.
I love surprises.
You love surprises too, don't ya?
Surprisingly, no.
Really?
I love them.
It's like these little mini-quiches.
They look like they'll be bland, and then-- Surprise, jalapeño.
Now, that's surprising.
- Here, put these on the table.
- All right.
Will?
Door, prontito.
Let's see, we got the cop, the cowboy, the lndian.
This has gotta be the construction worker.
- Sam?
- Will?
Grace?
Surprise.
Are you gonna hide in here all night?
I'm not hiding.
Thought Jack's party would be a good time to weed out my tie collection.
Will?
Pick the one you want to be strangled with.
Hugo Boss is kinda nice.
Grace?
Will, I had to do something.
You guys are gentiles.
This could go on for 40 years.
Will, he's here.
He obviously wants to make up.
Just go out there and settle it.
Gee, Grace, you're right.
Maybe after, we can swing by the Middle East and clear up that whole mess with a big group hug.
Well, even they called a truce every so often.
You know, to hide the nerve gas.
Will, every family has problems you have to work through.
I mean, don't you think the Kennedys had words when Maria married the Terminator?
I don't really think they care who the girls marry.
Will, you were so close.
I bet you can't even remember how it all started.
Five years ago, June 24th, mid-afternoon, he asked me what I honestly thought of his girlfriend.
I said, "She's morose and controlling and icy".
He said, "Too bad, I'm marrying her".
I said, "I don't think that's a very good idea".
He was wearing a blue shirt.
I was wearing the jeans-- All right, so you have a vague recollection.
But Will, he's here.
- You owe it to him.
- I owe it-- He is the one that cut me out of his life.
He's the one that leaves the family Christmas at 3:00 when he knows I'm showing up at 4:00.
I have a nephew that I have never met.
Do you know what that feels like?
Well, I got Jack his celebrity.
Leslie Uggams just arrived.
Grace, I don't want to see Sam.
I don't want to talk to Sam.
Okay, Leslie Uggams just left.
- So you'll stay here all night?
- Yup.
- You won't give him a chance?
- Nope.
Even if this is the last time this opportunity presents itself?
.
Yup.
Wow.
You know what my Aunt Pesha would say if she were in this room right now?
"Why the hell did my parents name me Pesha"?
No.
She would say-- What was she, a Yiddish mime?
- You didn't say anything!
- Oh, I said plenty.
I just gave you the Eye of Shame.
- Oh, Grace.
The-- - Hey-hey-hey!
Don't push Pesha!
Talk to the eye.
I think he's softening.
He just needs a little more time.
You can hang out for like - a year, right?
- Hmm.
He got Mom's stubbornness.
And I got Dad's stubbornness.
You know, if you were a functional family-- We'd be on display at Ripley's Believe It Or Not.
The three of you-- you, Will and Ginny, would sit down in a room and just-- and just hash it out.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Ginny and I are getting a divorce.
That's fantastic!
Oh, no.
I mean, that's awful.
I'm sorry.
It's just that's your way in with Will.
You've gotta tell him.
-  - Could I have everybody's attention?
I thought it would be fun if people came up and made a toast to the man of the hour.
So, who wants to say a few words about Jack?
Come on, queens are better to open.
Oh, all right.
I'll start.
Uh, hmm.
Oh, okay.
Say it's 12:45 and one of your real girlfriends cancels for lunch.
Well, there is nobody-- and I do mean nobody-- who can fill in like Jack.
Honey, if catty were a perfume, you'd reek of it.
I love ya, honey.
I do.
I love ya.
Okay, who's next?
I'll be next.
Jack, I joke with you a lot, I call you names-- names like Nelly, Mary, Tinkerbell.
Fembot, Ally McHomo.
Get to the good stuff or get off the stage.
Well, I love you, Jack.
I don't tell you that enough.
You're like-- truth be told, you're like the brother I never had.
And what do you know, the brother I never had is here tonight!
But see, unlike him, you'd never cut me out of your life or split up my family.
So here's to you, Jack.
Happy birthday.
What the hell kind of a toast was that?
Will?
Will?
Look, Ginny and I are getting a divorce.
That's too bad, Sam.
You guys deserved each other.
That's it.
I'm outta here.
- I tried.
- Sam, where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
- Why?
Why?
Didn't you hear what he just said?
Oh, oh.
No, that was just his way of reaching out.
Yeah.
Well, this is my way of staying.
Bye.
No, Sam.
Come on, come on.
It took you five years to get here, and you're only 15 feet apart.
That's like three feet a year.
Merchant lvory films move faster than that.
He obviously doesn't want to talk to me.
No, you're wrong.
In his bedroom, he said more than anything else, he wants to resolve this.
He actually said that?
'Cause "resolve" and "revolver" sound a lot alike.
I'm pretty sure he said resolve.
Please, Sam.
- Please try.
- I don't know, Grace.
Okay.
Who could say no to the Eye of Shame?
Thank you!
That's it.
Can you feel that?
Hi, lovers.
I love you all like lovers.
Really.
I love you and you and you and-- You, I don't know, but I could definitely see loving you.
Rrrrow!
But most of all, I love love.
I do.
Sometimes I love love so much, I wish I could take it to Vegas for a really naughty weekend.
Thank you, thank you.
But what makes today particularly special for me is Will: I don't care who you're divorcing, it doesn't change the fact that you cut me off!
Sam: Well, I'm here now!
At least I'm making an effort!
Okay, eyes back to me, okay?
- 29 years ago, I was - Sam: You called her a cold-hearted bitch!
Will: What was I supposed to do, lie?
!
Pay no attention to the brats behind the curtain!
So today, I turn 29, which is so unlike me.
Will: Oh, that's a load of crap and you know it!
- Sam: How long are you - It kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
What have I done with my life?
Where have I been?
Where do I want to go?
Well, I have all the answers, and I have written them down in the form of a poem.
Shut up!
"'Twas a starlit night in '69, When a boy named Jack arrived divine.
So, nibble your cheese and sip your wine, For today dear Jack turns 29".
- Honey, if you were born in '69 - "'Twas" you're 30.
No, I'm-- Okay, good.
I think we're making progress.
We've moved way past the Ginny incident into some very old issues.
We've heard about Will getting the better bike Sam getting the bigger room both of you liking Susie Borgeson-- and I think we all agree that one's moot.
So now, I'm going to take a break, because my throat's a little dry and I'm gonna let you guys take it from here.
No fighting.
No biting.
Just talk.
Relate.
Ay, goyim.
Hello?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Jack.
Jack, slow down I know.
I know it's hard, but you are.
You-- Buddy, trust me, you're 30.
Hey, cut off your arm and count the rings.
You're 30.
All right, I'm on my way over.
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's talking crazy.
Using words like "irritable bowel" and "steady job".
I better get over there.
Ahem.
Will?
Sam, it was-- - it was good to see you.
- Yeah, it was.
Make a plan.
So, Will, maybe we'll see each other while I'm in town.
Yeah.
- I'll call your hotel.
- Yeah, good.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
I know I threatened to strangle you with a tie, but uh I'm glad you made this happen.
I aim to meddle.
Oh my God.
This place is a mess.
Maybe we should just move.
I like what you've got goin' on, sort of early American frat house.
- Want some help?
- Uh, no.
It's okay.
Well, I'm gonna go.
I'm really glad you made this happen.
Thanks.
Me, too.
It's really good seeing you again, Sam.
Good to see you too, Grace.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Will?
Ei.
Eu pensei que você fosse arrumar isso aqui.
Eu tinha que lavar o rosto e não queria lavar com as mãos sujas.
-Você não estava na casa do Jack?
-Eu estava.
Ele está na maior neurose por fazer 30 anos.
No melhor estilo Greta Garbo.
Ele fica com uma mão na cabeça e uma camisola cheia de plumas molhada de lágrimas.
Por que você voltou?
Ele queria que eu pegasse o presente de aniversário dele.
Ah, está aqui.
lsso vai animá-lo.
Com uma coisa interessante na ponta, ele vai pular um metro.
''Pule, Jack.
Pule.
'' -Desculpe, você estava dormindo?
-Estava.
Você está vermelha.
É que eu estava sonhando.
-Um sonho erótico.
-Não.
Aliás, era bem surrealista.
Eu estava num navio pesqueiro e eu Sabe, virei uma galinha.
Eu vou voltar para a casa do Jack e venho para cá bem tarde.
-Está bem.
-Está bem.
Tem alguma coisa errada em eu me sentir bem com isso?
BRlGA EM FAMÍLlA SEGUNDA PARTE -Oi -Oi.
Quem é que adora você A Grace Adler.
Pois ela parou na padaria do Mendel e comprou três coisas para você com no nome.
E um light para mim.
Meu favorito: Bolinho de catarro.
Deixe na cozinha para mim, obrigado.
-Will, eu preciso falar com você.
-Espere aí.
Eu estou conversando com o dentista.
Ele quer saber com que artista eu pareço.
Quem é o ''Advogado Gostoso''?
Já existe um ''Advogado Gostoso''.
Queria falar alguma coisa?
Sim.
Sim.
Sim, eu quero.
Tá legal, muito bem Sabe quando, às vezes, você faz algo e se mete num enrosco e você sabe que é roubada mas você não percebe até que ponto vai essa roubada, até chegar no fim?
Claro, foi assim que ''Footloose: O Musical'' foi feito.
-Você fez sexo.
-Não.
Não?
Eu estou sentindo.
Não, não.
Deve ser só porque -eu fiz sexo.
-Sua taradinha.
É!
Mas quando?
Não, não fale.
Eu quero adivinhar.
Ontem, fizemos a festa Só tinha gay, exceto o meu irmão.
-Meu Deus.
-Will.
Meu Deus.
Meu Deus!
Não foi na festa.
Já sei, foi o cara da quitanda do Balducci.
-Como é?
Não.
-Não adianta mentir para mim porque eu vi a paquera com ele.
''Por favor, moço, essas frutas estão frescas?
'' Grace, sua malandrinha.
-Não foi com o cara da quitanda.
-Não foi?
Não.
Foi Meu Deus, recebi um e-mail.
Ele citou Nietzsche.
Será que ele é pretensioso ou só profundo e inteligente?
Já sei.
Vou mandar uma frase da autobiografia de Joan Lunden e ver se espanto o cara.
Então?
Com quem foi?
Foi com Ele mordeu a isca.
Nossa, ele quer me conhecer.
Será que eu topo?
Quero dizer, ele é dentista.
Vai nessa, talvez ele seja gostoso.
-Desculpe, você estava no meio -Não, não, não.
Não tem erro.
-Depois, a gente conversa.
-Mas eu estou a fim de saber.
-É que eu estou concentrado aqui -Não.
Tá limpo.
Conversamos depois.
Eu vou até a quitanda do Balducci.
Quer que eu traga alguma coisa?
O vendedor.
Ah, esse você já pegou.
O Jacobs precisou cancelar hoje e eu remarquei para amanhã à tarde.
Você pode ligar e marcar um horário só para saber se ele não O que foi?
Você transou.
O quê?
Como você Será que está tão na cara assim?
Eu não entendo.
-Como todo mundo percebe?
-Todo jogador de pôquer é contador.
E por falar nisso, com quem foi, hem?
Não foi com ninguém que você conheça.
-Foi com o Sam.
-Meu Deus.
Eu vou embora antes que você descubra todos os detalhes -do que rolou ontem à noite.
-Meu bem, pare com isso.
Seria impossível descobrir todos os detalhes.
-Só sei que foram duas.
-Ah, meu Deus!
Certo.
Vou tomar um café.
Pode me trazer uma rosquinha bem gostosa.
Nenhuma palavra.
Nenhuma palavra para ninguém.
Certo, querida, como quiser.
-Não direi nada para ninguém.
Eu -Jure.
Jure pela sua mãe Pelos seus enteados Pelas suas jóias.
Está bem, eu juro.
Bom dia, coisa linda.
Meu Deus.
Eu estou com 30 anos.
Sabe o que é isso em anos gays?
Eu estou acabado, derrotado, virei uma tiazona.
E esse gorro, querido?
O cabelinho está rebelde hoje?
Karen, eu estou de luto pela minha vida.
Eu entendo, fofo.
E se eu não tivesse passado o meu creme anti-rugas você perceberia a minha expressão de pena.
Eu estou com 30 anos e não fiz nada de bom na vida.
Nada que preste.
Não fiz nada.
Eu nunca vou ser feliz na minha vida de novo.
Meu bem, eu tenho uma fofoquinha.
Mas que droga!
Eu não posso contar.
Karen, é a minha felicidade que está em jogo.
Se aconteceu alguma tragédia ou alguma sacanagem eu quero saber!
Fofo, eu não posso contar.
Prometi que eu não ia falar nada.
Filha, faça algo para quebrar a promessa.
Faça mímica, sei lá.
Meu bem, eu já sei, eu já sei É o juramento das escoteiras?
Não, é para você adivinhar.
-Certo.
Certo.
-Não posso trair a confiança dela.
-Três palavras.
-Vamos lá.
A primeira palavra se parece Cabeça, olhos, nariz, rosto Rosto!
Parece rosto.
Rosto, chosto, nosto, costo, osto Querido, essas palavras não existem.
-Está bem, vamos lá.
-Rosto, encosto.
Ah, Meu Deus.
Espere.

A Grace.
Certo, segunda palavra.

-Terceira palavra.
Espere, como é que eu faço?
-Está bem, está bem.
Sam.
-Sam?
Meu Deus!
A Grace transou com o Sam?
Sou jovem de novo!
Sou jovem de novo!
Sou jovem de novo!
E você está saindo com alguém ou vai esperar o divórcio sair?
Na verdade, eu saí.
Eu estou saindo.
Que legal.
Fale sobre ela.
O que essa pessoa faz?
Como ela é?
Ela tem coxas musculosas, ombros largos quer dizer, você gosta dessas coisas ou sou só eu?
Só você.
-Sam, oi.
-Oi, Grace.
Que bom que você voltou.
Eu quero a sua opinião.
Eu vou tomar um café com o dentista cibernético daqui a uma hora.
Será que isso é loucura?
Será que é uma má idéia?
Eu jamais julgaria o que você faz com a sua vida amorosa.
Não importa quem seja.
Saia com quem quiser.
Transe com quem quiser.
Só quero que seja feliz.
Obrigado.
Bom, agora, crianças, eu vou pedir licença para vocês.
Eu vou cuidar dos meus dentinhos.
-Você não ia contar para ele?
-Eu tentei, não deu.
Conte você.
Grace, você não me contou quem era o cara.
-Depois eu conto.
-Está bem.
Tomara que role alguma coisa comigo para eu alcançar vocês.
Você saiu com alguém e o Sam também saiu.
Eu não acredito nisso.
Will, você está espumando pela boca.
Como você teve coragem?
Em geral, ou nessa situação, em particular?
Sem piada.
-Will, eu sinto muito.
-Foi um acidente.
Um acidente?
E como foi isso?
Desculpe, eu escorreguei e caí várias, várias e várias vezes.
-Sei que é meio esquisito.
-lsso não é esquisito, Grace.
Gays republicanos são esquisitos.
-lsso é loucura!
-Will, por favor.
Nós podemos lsso é bem coisa sua, Sam.
Você aparece na minha vida e vai se servindo de tudo.
-Nada mudou.
-Talvez não devêssemos contar.
Você queria o maior quarto e ficou para você.
Queria o carro do papai e ficou para você também.
E agora, a Grace.
Só tem uma coisa, amigo.
Não pode ficar com ela porque ela é minha.
-Com licença.
-Foi só uma noite.
-Sério?
Foi só uma noite.
-Está bem, foram duas vezes, mas Pare!
O que você quer que eu diga?
Que não vai entrar no meu quarto e pegar os meus brinquedos.
Seus brinquedos?
Eu sou um brinquedo?
Então, Will, me diga: Onde vão as pilhas?
Não, você está nervoso.
Não responda.
Will, Will.
Eu já pedi desculpas.
Não precisa bancar o possessivo e dominador, está bem?
Eu não sou possessivo nem dominador.
É o que o Sam não pode ficar com você porque você é minha.
Como eu sou boba!
Vivi esse tempo todo iludida achando que eu era a dona do meu nariz.
Você está exagerando.
É?
E você me traiu.
E o fato de você não entender o meu lado só piora as coisas.
Até que não foi tão ruim.
Pode uma coisa dessas?
''Ela é minha.
'' Sou propriedade dele.
Por acaso, ele virou algum Sultão das Arábias?
Meu bem, o que aconteceu com o seu cabelo?
Parece que o Tico e o Teco andaram por aí.
Quem é você para falar, Mulan?
Bom, muito bem, Grace.
Se quer mesmo saber, eu acho Eu acho que a questão aqui é outra.
Está bem, está bem, talvez o momento tenha sido errado, mas talvez Como eu posso dizer isso?
Eu acho que transou com o Sam porque ele é um Will que mexe nos seus peitinhos.
Como é?
O quê?
Mas Acha que transei com o Sam porque ele é uma versão hetero do Will?
Que coisa ridícula.
Karen, Karen, eu transei com o Sam -porque ele é bonito -O Will também.
-inteligente.
-O Will também.
-engraçado.
-Você acha que o Will é.
Chega.
O lance não teve nada a ver com o Will.
Meu bem, eu não estou julgando-a.
Afinal de contas qual a mulher que não gosta que mexam nos seus peitinhos?
Pare de falar peitinhos.
Está bem?
Está bem?
Olhe, você está redondamente enganada.
Você ficou louca, você tem uma vida muito estranha.
Eu não sei nem quem é você.
Peitinhos.
WlLL TRUMAN, ADVOGADO Ei, eu não quero patas sujas nem surpresas no meu tapete.
Klaus Von Puppy é limpinho e educado.
Não estava me referindo ao cachorro.
Já entendi, está trabalhando no caso mais dif´icil, ''Will vs.
Vida''.
-Está sabendo?
-É, eu estou.
Desembuche, bonita.
Eu tenho olhos para ver ouvidos para ouvir e uma cabeça para concordar com sabedoria.
Pode falar, você está no ar.
O que me deixa louco é que ele pensa que pode chegar na minha vida e se servir à vontade.
E o pior é que quer que eu ainda fique contente, mas eu não fiquei.
-Mas é claro que não, ela é sua.
-Obrigado.
Eu já terminei um montão de relacionamentos porque a pessoa não conseguia perceber que ela era minha.
É.
O quê?
Não.
Olhe, o meu lance com a Grace é bem diferente do seus casinhos passageiros.
Não, não é.
É a mesma coisa.
A Grace é sua.
Assim como você é meu, não é, Klaus bebê?
Eu decido quando ele come, quando ele sai quem ele cheira e quando ele corta as unhas, como você e a Grace.
Não, não foi isso que eu quis dizer.
Eu sei que a Grace não é minha.
E ela pode cheirar quem ela Vá embora, Jack.
Está bem, mas quer saber de uma coisa?
Vou dizer só uma coisinha.
Eu acho que está nervoso assim porque está com inveja do Sam.
O quê?
Está na cara.
Você gostaria de dormir com ela.
Que piração.
Piração mesmo, Will.
O que é isso?
Admita.
No fundo, você queria ter a Grace desse jeito.
Abraçar, dar uns beijos, sentir o perfume dela escorregar as mãos por trás Desculpe, apague o que eu falei.
Ellen, querida, pode trazer um sal de frutas, por favor?
Não sei como os heteros fazem com os negócios aqui e aqui.
Eu também não sei, Jack.
Mas um dia eu lhe ensino como se chama isso.
Bom, para finalizar, você está com ciÚmes.
Não da parte nojenta do sexo, mas do fato do seu irmão conhecer um lado da Grace que você nunca conhecerá.
Eu não estou certo?
-Está vendo o quê?
-Uns exercícios.
Sei lá, estão pulando pra caramba.
Acho que esse deve ser o ''Canal do Pulo''.
Por quê?
O controle está ali e eu estou aqui.
-Sou seu brinquedo.
-Eu sei, eu sei, eu sei Desculpe-me.
Eu não quero fazer tempestade num copo d'água.
Precisamos rir e chorar para chegarmos num acordo?
Não, podemos encurtar isso.
-Você está bem?
-Estou.
E você pode sair com quem você quiser.
Mesmo que seja alguém da minha árvore genealógica.
Eu vou trocar de roupa porque eu estou fedido e depois, eu vou sentar no sofá com você e ver Lifetime.
-Vai passar o filme da Michele Lee.
-Que filme é esse?
''Não Vou Viajar Sem Minha Filha Porque Tenho Um Tumor Cerebral, Mas Não Ache Ruim Você É Um Bêbado.
'' Beleza.
-Oi.
-Oi.
Eu estava no Village e pensei ''Se eu tomar dois metrôs, um ônibus e andar mais seis quadras, vou estar perto da casa dela.
'' -Tudo bem?
-Sim.
Tudo bem.
Está a fim de sair?
Acho que não.
Hoje ou nunca, certo?
É uma situação esquisita.
Parece que eu estou violando um dos mandamentos.
Não cobiçarás o irmão sumido do seu melhor amigo gay que apareceu de novo.
Não conheço esse mandamento.
Eu só li até o décimo.
Bom, então, eu vou indo.
Tomara que o Will saiba a sorte que ele tem por ter você.
Ele sabe.
Ligue para o seu irmão.
Escute, sabe o que o Jack falou?
Falou que eu estava com ciÚmes do Sam porque ele podia transar com você e eu não.
A Karen falou que eu transei com o Sam porque ele é uma versão heterossexual de você.
Será que temos que conversar sobre isso?
Vamos encurtar a conversa?
Grace, quer transar comigo?
Não vai dar.
Não transo com gays.
Esse é o problema.
Eu transo.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Oh.
that's okay.
I'll just wait for the next one.
Oh-- Or not.
I was going down.
but I don't have to go straight down.
We're all so goal-oriented.
It's really all about the journey.

And the company.
I'm Peter.

Uh.
Grace.
Grace Adler.
Well.

Oh.
sorry I'm late.
My driver hit a pedestrian on 57th Street.
and we had to stop and blah-blah.
ugh.
Oh my God.
Is he okay?
Mmm.
a little rattled.
but he always gets like that when he hits someone.
Karen you have to do something about him.
Eventually.
you know.
he's gonna kill someone.
You understand that would be wrong.
don't you?
Yeah.
I guess.
Fire him.
Grace.
he is old and sweet and helpless.
I can't just fire him because he's a raging incompetent.
I mean.
maybe you could.
but not me.
Karen.
if that were true.
we wouldn't be having this conversation.
You know.
I guess I should just cut him loose.
-  - I mean.
as Gandhi once said.
"You're only as strong as your weakest servant".
- I think he said that.
-  Or maybe it was.
"Wow.
this sand is hot"!
-  - Oh Honey.

It's kind of distracting.

Two buttons or three?

It's the difference between "I'll call you" and "I'll sell you an area rug".
Okay.
I'm taking the Merlot Jack stole from the restaurant after they fired him for stealing the Cabernet.
Grab me one!
Grab my shoe.

Did you eat salami today?
No.

- In a two bedroom.
- In two beds.
in separate rooms.
It's okay.
I get it.
You're married.
Just kidding.
Good.
Come on in.
sit down.
I'll open the wine.
Wow.
I can't believe you just moved in.
The place already looks great.
Ooh.
really great.
Really.
really great.
Thanks.
but.
it is only the living room.
Trust me.
you don't want to see the bedroom.
- Maybe later.
- Maybe later.
Go on.
go on.
sit down.
I am so glad you two could make it.
You're officially my closest friends in New York.
Oh-- Except for the guy who peed on my car this morning.
Ah.
he's more like family.
I know what you mean.
My uncle does the same thing.
That's a lie.
- To new friends.
- New friends.
You know.
you have the most beautiful smile.
It's-- it's a little crooked.
- Now.
so was Audrey Hepburn's.
- Oh.
come on now.
I hate my smile.
Well.
then stop smiling.
You know.
I thought we'd start off with some veggies.
or at uh.
4.99 a pound.
"crudites".
Great.
Well.
you know the old saying.
"Crudites.
gone tomorrow".
Yeah.
that's hot.
I-- I love Iove.
Iove.
Iove that sculpture.
Oh.
yeah.
I got that in Africa.
I found that traveling through Mombasa.
Ah.
yes.
Mombasa.
Was it last week you were in Mombasa.
Will or never.
Oh.
Iook.
Golf clubs.
Yeah.
yeah.
You play?
Well.
a little.
I gotta work on my swing.
I have such a hard time getting the ball in the clown's mouth.
Oh.
your-- your address is all wrong.
- Here.
- Yeah?
Let me show you.
You just want to pull back and follow through.
Pull back-- Pull back-- - Head down.
- Mmm.
Follow through.
- Better?
- Much better.
Yeah.
thank you.
-  - Oh.
I gotta check on dinner.
I hope you like veal marsala.
I slaved for hours over the takeout menu.
Wow.
You smell great.
Thank you.
What are you wearing?
Just me.
That's a lie.
I'll be right back.
Well - I think it's pretty clear.
- You're right.
- Go home.
- Go home.
- You go home!
- You go home!
Peter is not gay.
Oh.
please.
You think everybody is straight.
He's gay.
so you can just stop flirting.
Oh.
wrongo.
Marilu.
He's straight.
So-- so you can stop posing with that fake interested look.
"Ah.
yes.
Mombasa".
Oh-- oh-- oh.
hello?
"I hate my smile".
What about your charming fake laugh?
Oh-- oh-- oh-- oh!
That doesn't compare to your fake laugh.
with the-- Oh.
that's a good one.
Grace.
That's good.
Oh my God.
This is so stupid.
I didn't come here to compete with you.
Well.
neither did l. Can't we just sit here and behave like normal human being people?
- Deal.
- Deal.
Okay.
I hope this is all right.
One question.
is veal supposed to have a beak?
Believe me.
Driver.
this has been harder for me than it has for you.
Mrs. Walker.
am I fired because I'm-- I'm a bad driver?
No.
no.
You're very good at what you do.
I just think it's time for a change.
I mean.
I know that you want-- Honey.
I'm over here now.
I remember that you always wanted to do other things in your life.
Why.
I recall you having an interest in woodworking.
- That was Cook.
- Oh.
that's right.
I'm sorry.
You loved the clarinet.
That was Maid.
Honey.
you're gonna have a lot of free time on your hands now.
Find a hobby.
We've had some good times.
Mrs. Walker.
- haven't we?
- Oh.
it has been fun.
Why.
I remember the time that-- Why.
I remember the time that Stan and I were in the car.
and we blew a fan belt.
and you had to push the car all the way to New Jersey.
Almost lost a toe to frostbite.
Those were the good times.
Oh.
and how about when we used to take our little country drives and play our favorite game-- "Spook The Horse"?
Oh.
they do hate the sound of that horn.
don't they?
Well.
I'm gonna miss you.
Driver.
but I'm sure you'll land on your feet-- unlike those people you hit.
Will.
come on.
He's perfect for me.
Except for one little problem.
He's perfect for me.
I need this more than you.
Oh.
please!
You've had plenty of dips in the love pool.
I'm still in the cabana.
trying out floaties.
Okay.
- Gimme the phone.
- Get-- No!
No.
no.
no.
no.
no!
- Agh!
- Give it to me!
Put it in my hand!
You can have it when I'm done!
Ow!
You're hurting me with it!
You're gonna break it!
Will.
I told you.
you live with a hetero long enough.
you're going to catch it.
Fine.
You want him so bad.
you can have him-- even though he's gay!
He is not gay.
What's this?
A question of sexual orientation?
The doctor is in.
- Oh.
Jack-- - No.
no.
Jack has the most finely tuned gaydar in the tri-state area.
Do-do-do-do-do Ding!
He can name a gay guy in one note.
Ah.
yes.
many have sought my counsel on this subject.
They say.
"Jack is a wise man.
Jack is a dangerous man.
Jack is a gr-r-r-r-eat man".
No.
Jack is just a man.
A man who knows men who like men.
Bring to me the facts.
Okay.
In his bathroom.
he had three magazines.
and one of them was "Martha Stewart's Living".
He also had "Basketball Digest".
Ah.
you both make compelling points.
but I believe the truth is to be found in the third magazine.
- "Vanity Fair".
- Unless it's "Vanity Fair".
You're right.
Will.
He is good.
Now.
there is one question you can ask that will reveal the truth.
I hesitate to share this secret with you.
for it has awesome power.
What would that question be?
Are you gay?
Thank you Homo Won Kenobi.
Who is it?
Peter: Oh.
hey.
guys.
It's me.
Wha-- wha-- wha-- hey-hey-hey!
How about bringin' the desperation level down about three clicks.
huh?
Not attractive.
Open the door.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Want to go to a movie?
- Movie.
that's a good idea.
- Oh.
yeah.
- Why don't you come in?
- Oh.
thanks.
We really want you to meet a friend of ours.
Um.
this is Jack.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hello.
I know.
So uh.
there's a couple of movies I was into checkin' out.
Hey.
Peter.
uh.
before we go.
there's something I want to ask you.
- Will.
don't.
- Grace.
I need to ask him.
- No.
you don't.
- I think it's important.
- Not now.
No.
- I need to know.
Grace wants to know if you like boys or girls.
Will!
Eh.
do I like boys or girls?
Well.
isn't it obvious?
!
- Yes.
I've been trying to-- - Yes.
- No.
we're having trouble.
- I have no idea.
I gotta tell you.
This has never happened to me before.
Look.
we're-- We're just trying to figure out which one of us you're dating.
Dating?
Who said anything about dating?
I thought we were friends.
Well.
it started out as friends.
but you sniffed me.
Yeah.
and-- and then you let me hold your club.
Oh.
my.
- Where you-- where you-- - Where you going?
You know.
I'm-- I'm gonna take a rain check on the movie.
This is what I get for movin' to New York.
And to clarify things.
you're not my type.
Wow.
- That was embarrassing.
- Yeah.
How do you feel?
What do you mean.
how do I feel?
Sweetie.
you just got dumped.
Oh.
I don't think so.
You got dumped.
He's clearly gay.
Oh.
please!
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.
Iet's eat.
He's straight.
You think everybody's gay.
Okay.
we never go after the same guy again.
- Unless it's George Clooney.
- Agreed.
In which case.
we share.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Going down?
- We'll take the stairs.
- We'll take the stairs.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Grace.
we're going to a cabin in the woods.
I'm almost certain you're not going to need a sequined purse.
Okay.
Do you need it?
Grace.
with this outfit?
No-- So tell me again.
Why are we doing this?
I told you.
I need to see winter.
Come on.
we'll build a snowman.
do funny things with the carrot.
Well  I do like me vegetables.
But.
I mean.
a whole weekend with Jack and Karen-- Oh.
come on.
That's the incentive.
Just think about it.
Karen.
doing anything in nature?
And Jack chopping wood?
Hmm.
To the cabin we will go And ski upon the snow We'll see a lot of bears Forgettin' all our cares.
Yeah-- Ladies and gentlemen.
give it up for Puff Mommy.
Okay.
okay.
Iisten.
As far as Will knows.
this is just a fun.
impulsive getaway for the weekend.
so please.
no mention of Michael or the fact that tomorrow would have been their anniversary.
This is to take his mind off that.
Oh.
Iook.
mittens and a muff.
Is this on?
Ooh.
can I have this.
It'll bring out the chestnut in my eyes.
No.
No.
that's Will's.
and that's the last thing he'd want to see.
Michael gave that to him for his birthday.
Hi.
I'm Scarfy.
I'm the gift you give your boyfriend before you dump him.
I cost $12.
Hey!
Sensitivo!
- What did I just say to you?
- I heard you.
You know.
no one took me on vacation when I broke up with what's-his-face.
uh bleached hair.
tattoo.
goatee.
Who am I talking about?
God.
I don't know.
honey.
You just described a needle in a gaystack.
All right.
everybody.
come on in.
Girls are downstairs.
boys are up.
Hey.
people!
Careful with my luggage.
Grace?
Honey.
six inches from the walls.
I can tell you're a basher.
All right.
here you go.
For your troubles.
Karen.
you're tipping us?
We're not gonna take your money.
Will Mum be needing towels this evening?
- Isn't this fantastic?
- Yeah.
Oh God.
Iook at it.
There's like no one around.
My God.
what if we got trapped up here?
Who'd we eat first?
Well.
Karen's out.
'cause there's nothing natural or digestible on her body.
- And I mean that as a compliment.
- And I took that way.
honey.
Well.
I'm out.
'cause I'm too petite.
A good soup is all you're gonna get from me.
It'd have to be someone with enough meat slash fat on him.
Oh.
Will.
Try not to move around too much.
It'll keep you tender.
Wait a minute.
How come no one wants to eat me?
All: Too chewy.
Karen.
did you see this?
It's a note from the caretaker.
Cook's dead.
- Who's Cook?
- Our cook.
Your cook's name is Cook?
No.
Grace.
he has a name.
I just don't remember it.
Well.
wait a minute.
it'll come to me.
it'll come to me.
"Where are my damn eggs Paul"?
Paul.
God.
Paul is dead.
Now who the hell is gonna cook for us?
!
I guess this concludes the mourning period.
Wait.
Maybe the passing of Cook was a blessing in disguise.
I'm gonna cook.
Men.
go hunt wild game.
There's a White Hen Pantry two miles down the hill.
Karen.
the gays don't catch.
Allow me to go hunt and gather for the womenfolk.
Jack.
don't you think it would be nice if you went with Will.
so that he didn't have to be alone?
Okay.
Very well.
I'll hunt and gather with our womenfolk.
Thanks again.
Karen.
for letting us use your cabin.
This is gonna be so great for Will.
Aw.
no problem.
honey.
Stan had to take his kids to Scarsdale to see their real mother.
What was her name?
Wait a minute.
It'll come to me.
"Stan.
take the kids to see that bitch Cathy"!
Cathy.
Hey.
Mrs. Walker.
Campbell.
is that you?
Little Campbell?
My.
my.
Iook how you've grown.
We saw each other three months ago.
Oh.
well.
I guess everything just looks bigger in the woods.
- Campbell?
- Oh my God.
Grace Adler?
Oh my God.
You two know each other?
- High school!
- We went to see "Loverboy" together.
Oh my God!
That's right.
we did.
So you were both geeks in high school.
Campbell.
what are you doing here?
Little of everything.
I take care of cabins.
In the winter.
I ski.
The summer.
I bike.
Yeah.
The outdoors agrees with you.
Works for you.
Does a lot for you.
And stale air and concrete does a lot for you.
You look good.
You look really good.
I can't believe you're here.
Honey.
Campbell brought the wood in.
Looks like he'll be leaving with it.
too.
I should go finish my rounds.
But do you want to get together later.
grab a beer?
Oh.
yeah.
I'd love to.
Oh.
um.
I-- I can't.
I came up with friends.
and we have um stuff.
Okay.
Well.
if you change your mind.
I'm working till midnight at Ed's Beachcomber.
It's a local pub.
Okay.
It was really good seeing you.
- All right.
uh.
take care.
- Okay.
Midnight.
Why can't I order that from the L.L. Bean catalogue?
Woman.
are you insane?
!
- Go fetch it!
- Oh-- No.
this weekend is about Will.
We're all here for him.
Oh.
I cannot believe you.
We are trapped alone in the wilderness with Wayland and Madam.
and you just let Babe the Blue Ox walk out that door?
Now.
you think about that.
Jack.
that's not a word.
Uh.
yeah.
it is.
Use it in a sentence.
Every morning.
I "spramp" my face with cold water.
"Spramp" your face?
What the hell is that?
Yes.
spramp.
Spramp!
The bubbles from the Jacuzzi spramp up.
Note how the sea spramps off the jagged rocks.
Just because you do this.
doesn't make it a word.
I don't know.
Will.
Before I get into bed.
I like to spramp on a little gardenia for Stan.
No.
you don't!
You do not spramp.
because no one has ever spramped anything in the history of language.
Jeez.
what a karpooch.
Tell me about it.
Okay.
Jack.
Iet it go.
Sorry.
I forgot this is "Will's" weekend.
Ow.
- What was that?
- Um.
of fun.
Will's weekend of fun.
Are you having fun?
- Yeah.
- Good!
- Woo!
- Excellent.
perfect.
great.
"'Overacted' said the New York Times".
"'Cheap and transparent.
' said the Boston Globe".
Look.
this wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that this would have been Michael's and my anniversary?
- No!
No.
absolutely not.
- Come on.
that's ridiculous.
Come on.
get over yourself.
- Okay.
I guess so - All right.
yeah.
I guess in a way it is.
Guys.
that's really very sweet.
but it's not a big deal.
Look.
Will.
we knew that this was gonna be a difficult weekend for you.
and we just thought this would take your mind off of it.
-  - Oh.
there's my roast.
Guys.
thank you.
It's not that I don't appreciate your little pity party.
but.
really.
take my word for it.
I'm okay about Michael.
She's such a brave little toaster.
Okay.
here it is.
Mmm.
Mmm.
mmm.
- What is it?
- Beef tenderloin.
I don't think it's dead yet.
It just looks mad and really hot.
Karen.
it looks great.
And it smells-- It smells.
Um.
Will.
what-- what does it smell like?
It smells like-- - "Pizza.
pizza".
- I'll make the call.
- I'll clear the table.
- I'll bury this.
Karen: Hey.
wait a minute Well.
I'm bored.
I'm gonna go take my disco nap.
You know.
even though you lied to me and deceived me and Karen's here.
I'm still having a good time.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
And if there's anything else I can do for you-- Now that you mention it.
there is one thing.
You can finish drying.
- I'm going upstairs.
- Are you sure?
'Cause if you want.
we can make s'mores.
S'mores?
Miss Adler.
of all the counselors here at Camp Walker.
you're my favorite.
God.
I thought he was never gonna leave.
It's 11 :30.
Come on.
get it in gear.
- What are you talking about?
- Honey.
it's almost midnight.
Time for Cinderella to turn into a frisky little minx.
huh?
Huh?
Ooh-- When did you turn into a poker?
Grace.
it's 11 :30.
Campbell gets off work in half an hour.
Don't you want to find out if he's mm-mm good!
?
What about Will?
Oh.
what about him?
Come on.
Grace.
I mean.
Iook.
Iook out there.
Those squirrels are gettin' more action than you are.
I don't know.
Me reuniting with an old boyfriend when Will is trying to forget about his?
It just doesn't seem-- Damn.
Iook at those squirrels go.
All right.
Grace.
You're right.
you're right.
Forget about Campbell.
Who needs him?
Who needs his strong.
sinewy arms and his washboard abs?
His fierce.
dark.
penetrating eyes looking at you as he backs you up against the sink.
grabs you by the hair.
turns you roughly-- not too roughly.
but.
hell.
what's too roughly?
- Hey.
you're fogging up the windows.
- Yeah.
- Why don't you go to bed?
- Mmm.
Jack: Okay.
this is the money hand.
Showcase showdown.
Yup.
whoever loses this hand is gonna be showin' the goodie package.
Honey.
wh-- why are we doing this?
Well.
it's strip poker.
We just keep playing till we're both naked.
And then Well.
we could   Did you hear that?
- Yes.
- Oh my God.
Honey.
well-- Oh my God.
do you see that?
What is that?
It looks like a big red matted rodent or something.
Well.
I can't quite-- Oh.
there it is!
What the hell is that?
!
I don't know.
but it's moving around back!
I'll get the flashlight.
I-- I don't think I've ever seen that color in nature before.
Oh my God!
ls it a yeti?
No.
it's a single white female with a terra-cotta rinse.
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!
Well.
I'm sorry.
We thought you were Big Foot's cousin.
Big Hair.
So where were ya?
Did you go out with Loverboy?
Yes.
And keep your mouths shut about it.
if that's possible.
Well.
color you moody.
What's the problem?
What's the problem?
You want to know what the problem is?
There's a man out there who wants me.
and I'm not with him because there's a man upstairs who needs me.
I'm spramped if I do.
I'm spramped if I don't.
Okay.
first of all.
that's the incorrect use of that word.
Second of all.
so.
cut to the chase.
I'm I gonna be an uncle or not?
No.
we just kissed.
Okay.
then a little over-the-sweater action.
but that's it.
Grace.
I got further with Jack tonight.
I haven't felt this good in a long time.
and it's all your fault.
Karen.
Hey.
I have feelings too.
you know?
Damn it.
I was trying to keep a straight face.
I'm going to bed.
And by the way.
it looks like Dr. Zhivago threw up on you.
She needs help.
Listen.
we gotta clear out of here tomorrow night so that Grace can be with Campbell.
Uh.
there's a gay bar exactly 5.3 miles north-northwest of here.
Gaydar?
- Cop at the toll booth.
- Oh-- Are you sure this is a gay bar?
At first I was afraid I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side Here.
Iet me buy you a drink.
Thank you.
Jack.
That's nice of you to offer.
- 20 enough?
- Yeah.
that'll get us started.
- What's your pleasure?
- Mmm Both: George Stephanopoulos.
Mmm.
Okay.
before we go any further.
I just have to say that I do not want this getting around school.
I'm running for class treasurer.
and if you blab.
I'm only gonna get the football vote.
- Can I tell Billy Wilcox?
- Hmm I thought you were Billy Wilcox.
Oh.
well.
Will: Grace.
open up.
I don't have a key.
- Oh my God.
it's Will.
- Your boyfriend?
No.
worse.
My gay roommate.
You've gotta hide.
Here.
on the porch.
Gracie-- - Hi.
- Hi.
What are you doin' home?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just-- Why be in an empty bar when I can be hangin' out with you?
You look flushed.
Gracie.
Are you sick?
Oh.
Oh.
yeah.
Yeah.
I-- I think I'm contagious.
You should stay away from me.
Goodnight.
Yeah.
you're in a weird mood.
You didn't eat any of Karen's cooking.
did you?
'Cause I thought I threw that whole thing in the lake.
Oh my God.
it's back.
and this time it's personal.
Don't answer that.
It's-- it's probably just the-- the-- the wind blowing a pine cone against the door three times in rapid succession.
What are you talkin' about.
crazy?
It's probably just Jack.
You know what?
Screw him.
No.
thank you.
Jack.
did you-- Hi.
What do you know.
it's winter out there.
Uh.
did I interrupt something?
Yeah.
and I think I should be going.
I'm sorry.
Campbell.
Am I moving?
I can't feel my legs.
Uh.
Grace?
What's with the mansicle?
I am so sorry.
We ran into each other yesterday.
and it just-- it just happened.
I didn't plan on it.
You ran into each other yesterday?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't-- I didn't want to upset you.
Why would that upset me?
You know.
your anniversary.
and I know that you're feeling sort of fragile-- Oh.
fragile.
So now I'm s-- I'm so lonely and pathetic that I can't even handle the fact that my best friend is seeing someone?
- Is that it?
- No.
no.
I just-- I-- I wanted to protect you.
But.
Iook.
I don't need you to protect me from Na-nookie of the North out there.
I told you I was fine.
I know.
Will.
but you always say that you're fine.
Because I am fine!
You think I care who you sleep with?
Sleep with as many guys as you want.
I don't care if you sleep with two guys.
or six guys or 11 guys or 27 guys!
Okay.
I get it.
You know a lot of numbers.
Don't feel sorry for me.
Grace.
okay?
I'm fine.
In fact.
I'm more than fine.
I'm perfectly fine!
- Then why are you shrieking?
- Because I'm not fine!
I miss Michael.
I don't want to.
but I do.
I know.
And I sympathize.
That's why I brought you up here.
- And the thing that kills me - What?
is that if a neurotic wingnut like you can get on with her love life-- - Okay.
Iosing my sympathy now.
- No.
no.
But.
I mean.
you know.
if you-- if you can and I can't.
what does that say about me?
Will.
it doesn't say anything about you.
- I just got there first.
- I know.
I know.
and I'm happy for you.
I think it's great.
I just can't believe that a lunatic like you got there first.
Okay.
we've been down that road already.
I thought.
All right.
it's-- No.
it's great.
Maybe I need to be more of a lunatic.
- I think you've got that color.
- Yeah.
Will: So what happened next?
So then we kissed for a really long time?
- Breath?
- Perfect.
He had brushed his teeth.
but not right before.
so it wasn't one of those Colgate kisses.
Blah-blah-blah.
get to the good stuff.
I'm going to bed.
I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.
Wow.
it was that good?
No.
it just doesn't happen that often.
I have to ration.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
I wonder.
how it's gonna be When you don't know me How's it gonna be When you're sure I'm not there How's it gonna be
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- We still on for lunch?
- Can't.
- Well.
what about dinner?
- Can't.
Well.
how about I wake you up at 3:00 a.m. for some calamari?
Can.
but won't.
Grace.
you've been working seven days a week.
I haven't seen you in like forever.
The children don't even know what you look like anymore.
Tell them I look like a young Rita Hayworth.
Mmm What.
I've been told.
Will.
I promise we'll do something soon.
And if not.
the day after soon.
Nah.
soon's no good for me.
I'm having lunch at the whatchamacallit with what's-his-name.
Hi.
Jack.
Bye.
Jack.
Dad.
was that you?
Okay.
my court date is this afternoon.
Do you have any last minute advice?
Yeah.
you shouldn't have slapped a meter maid.
Honestly.
Jack.
sometimes I don't know where your head is.
- Mom.
is that you?
- All right.
You remember what I told you to tell the judge?
Yes.
It's not bad.
but I've made a few adjustments.
It's just the writer in me.
Jack.
Iisten to me.
Don't recite any soliloquies.
Don't sing any show tunes.
Don't do the whole Perry Gayson thing.
okay?
What time are you heading downtown?
Oh.
uh.
when l Forget all my troubles.
forget all my cares And go downtown!
Yo Petula?
It's nice to see you're taking this so seriously.
Actually.
I am.
That's why I would like a loan for $50 that I don't have to pay back for some blond highlights.
I feel it will soften me in the eyes of the jury.
There's the fridge.
Get a lemon and rub it on your head.
Ba-da-bum-bum.
bum-ba-da-ba-da Ba-ba-bum-ba-da- ba-da-dum Bum-bum.
How can you-- I'm going downtown.
And they said Tinky Winky was the only gay Teletubby.
Nice advice.
Counselor.
I got 40 hours of community service.
I have to pick up trash for the next two weeks.
Yeah.
at least this trash won't call you the next morning.
This is so stupid.
I can't believe my hard-earned tax dollars are being spent prosecuting guys like me - who did nothing wrong.
- Okay.
Jack.
A) Nothing you've ever made has been hard-earned; B) You never paid taxes until this year; and C) You did something wrong.
You Zsa Zsa'd a meter maid!
You know.
it's against the law.
Yeah.
well.
the law sucks.
darling.
Oh.
now I've gone and worked up an appetite.
Take me to dinner tonight.
you know.
for my last meal.
Sorry.
"Dead Beat Walking".
Grace and I have plans.
Oh.
right.
The missus before the mistress.
Grace Adler Designs.
Hi.
Karen.
Grace.
the reason you're not in a relationship is on line one.
Hey.
what's up?
Hey.
are we still on for dinner?
'Cause there's this new kosher Chinese place around the corner.
I'm in the mood for a little sweet and sour oy-my-back.
I can't.
Big problems with the Schneiderman townhouse.
I have to rip up all the curtains and the carpet.
Apparently.
the only rug Mr. Schneiderman is interested in is the one that's on his head.
Hey.
hey.
Tell-- hey.
tell Karen I love her.
Well-- I'll-- I'll wait.
Let me wait.
No.
eat without me.
I'm gonna be late late.
Late late?
Why-why-why-why-why?
Because-because-because- because-because.
Okay.
Dorothy.
I gotta go.
- Hey.
hey - What?
Tell-- hey.
tell Karen I want to French kiss her when I see her.
- I'll see you when I see you.
- Bye.
Poor Will.
Now he's being blown off by women.
Ooh.
hey.
it's the elevator chanteuse.
I caught your act between floors nine and two.
Ah.
all those years on the escalator have really paid off.
- I'm Will.
by the way.
- Oh.
I'm Val.
I just moved in to 15F.
Nice apartment.
Good divorce lawyer.
Oh.
sorry.
Was it messy?
Actually.
it was-- You know what?
I'd really rather not talk about it.
It just still sort of hurts my feelings.
Oh.
Val.
I'm s-- I wouldn't have brought it up if l It's okay.
I'm just kidding!
- I'm kidding!
- You-- yeah-- I was kidding.
But.
no.
actually he was-- he was just a real jerk.
though.
you know?
Whenever we argued.
he used to-- he used to talk about himself in the third person.
He'd be like.
"Val.
Jerry needs his space right now".
And I'd be like.
"Val's gonna take half your money right now".
Will wonders why Val married Jerry.
Well.
as it turns out.
I was a jackass magnet.
but I've now been demagnetized.
so all the creepy guys just slide off of me.
Oh.
thank you.
Thank you.
You funny lady.
And you gay fella.
Which actually kills me 'cause you're so cute.
Yeah.
What was the giveaway?
I guess the abundance of boxer briefs.
Ah.
yes.
The homosexual is the leading exponent of the underpant hybrid.
Hey.
do you want to have dinner later?
You're probably busy.
or is that weird that I just asked you No.
no.
no.
I just got canceled on.
actually.
for tonight.
Well.
you know.
there's a kosher Chinese place around the corner.
Really?
Hey.
man.
I could really go for some Mu Shu- it-wouldn't-kill-you- to-call-your-mother.
What is this overstuffed bigness?
This chair is where foam goes to die.
It's no good.
It's gotta go back.
Oh my God.
I'm so stressed out.
Honey.
you know.
whenever I get stressed out.
I always like to-- You always like to what?
Gosh.
I don't think I've ever been stressed out.
I mean.
why would I be?
I've got practically no responsibilities.
my job's a breeze.
and I got a killer rack.
Good morning!
Oh.
woo!
- Aw.
you know when you just said that?
- Hmm.
yeah?
You got the cutest little wrinkles right there.
What?
Where?
Feel that?
That's stress.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Grace Adler.
Val Basset.
- Hi.
nice to meet you.
- How you doin'?
Nice to meet you.
And this is Karen Walker.
She uh.
I use this term loosely.
"works" here.
- Nice to meet you.
- Well.
any friend of Will's is Grace.
Val.
you know.
Will has just said the best things about you.
and it kills me that I can't have lunch with the two of you - 'cause I have too much work to do.
- No.
you're not canceling again.
I thought we could all have lunch together in SoHo.
Oh.
yeah.
And after.
we gotta go by Prince Street to see that guy who can put himself through the tennis racket.
Frank.
I love Frank.
- That guy rakes it in.
- I know.
He's like the richest homeless guy in Manhattan.
I know.
he actually made the "Misfortune 500".
- I was just going there.
- I know.
I beat ya.
Get out.
already!
You.
I'll see sometime before autumn.
You know.
unless.
of course.
there's another design emergency!
Okay.
I'm gonna need ten cc's of chintz.
stat!
Clear!
Isn't it amazing.
Val?
Will is a guy.
and yet he can achieve multiple sarcasm.
Well.
I'm really glad that we got to meet?
Me.
too.
Ooh.
you got a little eyelash right there.
- Mmm.
- Ooh.
make a wish.
No.
she's still here.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
Bye.
Oh.
she's sweet.
What?
I don't like the way she's so chummy with your husband.
Please don't refer to him as my husband.
All right.
fine.
I don't like how chummy she is with your non-romantic life partner.
Also bad.
so please stop.
okay?
I'm glad he has a new friend.
especially since I'm so busy.
Your sexless lover!
- Um dirty linen shirts?
- Uh-- - Uh.
your ex-husband.
- Things you take to the cleaners.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay.
um-- Oh.
egg whites.
- Uheh--- - Thoroughbred horses.
Um..
Eh.
James Brolin.
- Things that are whipped.
- Yeah!
- Oh!
- Time.
Time.
time.
You guys are amazing.
- Okay.
I'm gonna total up your time.
- Add it up.
honey.
Yeah.
that's generally what I mean when I say I'm totalling it up.
Rob.
Mmm.
Sorry.
honey.
Oh.
gosh.
Hey.
may be a record.
Will.
- Record.
Will!
- Record!
Woo!
- Hiya!
- Oh.
hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hey.
guys.
- What are you doing home?
- I thought you had to work?
- Uh.
yeah.
I do.
I just came home to change before my meeting.
- We're playing "Pyramid".
- I see.
You know.
Will and I are champions.
Oh.
I don't know.
Grace.
Looks like you got some competition.
- Oh.
yeah.
- Yeah!
I don't think so.
Rob.
Oh.
I don't know.
Val is awesome.
Ooh Remember the time that Will and I finished an entire round in two minutes and 14 seconds.
No way!
Hey.
Grace.
we're the same.
Come on.
we gotta hurry if we want to make that reservation.
Okay.
You have a good meeting.
and remember.
there's no "diviner designer".
- Bye.
Will.
- Bye.
Val.
Did I just call you Val?
- Yeah.
- That's funny.
Things that aren't funny.
So I walk in and this woman that he met like five minutes ago is in our house.
playing with our friends.
using our coasters.
And he's dipping her.
He actually dipped her.
Oh.
it's the oldest story in the world.
honey.
Boy meets girl.
boy meets new girl.
boy dips girl.
boy sleeps with boys.
Wait a minute.
maybe that's not the oldest story.
Maybe that's the Sal Mineo story.
Ah.
But.
honey.
you know.
if you want to hold on to your man.
you gotta work it a little bit.
I mean.
a slinky negligee.
a nice perfume.
Speak to him in a Dutch accent like his childhood nanny.
I'm gonna call him for lunch.
Oh.
honey.
if you're calling him at work.
don't bother.
- He's home sick.
- No.
he's not.
Yeah.
he is.
Mm-hm.
I called his office this morning.
Stan's going hot-air ballooning.
and I wanted to review my pre-nup.
I can't believe I didn't know Will was sick.
Why didn't he call me?
I mean.
who could take better care of him then I can?
Val: Hello?
Hello?
Taking care of him when he's sick.
Could she be more hateful?
Val?
What a surprise.
Hi.
Grace.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
How are you feeling?
Oh.
I'm at death's door.
Only the bouncers won't let me in 'cause I don't look cool enough.
Do you have any Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt?
No.
Val.
what are you doing here?
Oh.
just helping out our friend.
Sickie.
here.
Aw.
thanks.
Well.
I'm home now.
so you can go.
I'll help out Sickie.
Oh.
no.
go back to work.
Grace.
We got it covered.
I just made a pot of split pea soup here.
so Sickie won't be Sickie anymore.
Well.
Sickie doesn't like split pea-- Uh.
could you stop calling me Sickie?
Or Sickie's gonna get pukey.
Can you believe what I've been reduced to?
I bitch-slapped the law and the law won.
My poor little misdemeanor.
Honey.
your skin looks great.
What are you doing different?
- Just pore strips.
- Oh.
I hate this.
I mean.
New Yorkers are such pigs.
Look at this.
Ugh.
chicken bones.
and broken lipsticks and candy wraps.
Looks like the inside of Grace's purse.
Why don't people just use the garbage can?
- Look at this.
Ugh.
- Oh.
Who would throw away their phone bill in the street?
I mean.
would it be so hard for Soon-Yi Allen to walk two feet?
- Oh my God.
- Oh.
We have Soon-Yi Allen's phone bill.
Mama Mia!
And I mean that literally.
Karen.
what should we do?
Make a prank phone call!
Come on.
No.
that would be wrong.
One thing I've learned from this experience.
is that you need to respect the rights of others.
Come on.
come on.
come on.
I can't believe I got that all out with a straight face.
- I'll get the soup for you.
- I got it.
- I'll do it.
- I'm already doing it.
- It's my bowl.
- My soup.
- My stove.
- My recipe.
My God!
- My skin is burning.
- Oh my God.
are you okay?
What is the matter with you two?
It's not "feed a cold.
scald a fever".
Grace.
can I say something to you?
And l-- I really-- I really mean this in the most supportive way but you seem very threatened and insecure.
And I mean this in the most supportive way get out of my house.
you wing-nut.
Okay.
I 'll go.
I just want to let you know.
you have a little soup there on your blouse.
- Here.
Iet me - I got it.
Look what you did.
This was a really expensive blouse!
Hey-- Sorry.
you had a little bit of that delicious split pea on your collar.
I'm so sorry.
I thought that was soup.
but I guess it was part of the pattern.
You know what?
This is crazy.
We are grown.
mature women here.
It's crazy.
right?
Okay.
I'm gonna get my coat.
Once again.
girl-on-girl action and it's totally lost on me.
Hey.
hey.
Gabrielle.
Xena.
Break it up.
- What is going on?
- She started it.
- You did.
- Nuh-uh!
Okay.
okay!
"Nuh-uh".
was just uttered by an adult.
You're both taking a time-out.
Go to your corners.
Go on.
- Bitch.
- Psycho!
Hey!
Hey!
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.
Well.
fine.
then I'll just go back to my room and you two can work it out in Thunderdome.
It's just that you know.
I've just been really busy.
and I turn my back and I've been replaced-- by that wacko.
It takes one to replace one.
Wait a min-- wait a minute.
Grace.
are-- are you jealous?
No.
Are you kidding?
Like I would be like-- I would even-- yes.
I'm totally jealous.
What are you lookin' at?
The role of Will's best friend has always been and will always be filled by one scrappy little Grace Adler.
Really?
'Cause it hasn't felt that way lately.
Yeah.
but you haven't been around lately.
Grace.
you've gotta let me date other women.
I know.
I guess it's only fair.
I date other men.
Yeah.
I even sleep with some.
Lucky.
You two have something you want to say to each other?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm really sorry that I get a little crazy sometimes.
you know?
Can I sit down?
It's just that sometimes I just feel a little envious of-- I mean.
it's like-- I've never had a Will before.
you know?
I just moved in here after a very painful divorce.
and.
you know.
I don't know anybody.
and I just so wanted to connect with someone who didn't want anything back from me.
you know?
Oh.
Val.
I feel so awful.
I'm just kidding!
I'm kidding!
I'm totally kidding.
Like there aren't-- Iike there aren't a million gay guys in New York.
you know?
- You're a little nuts.
right?
- I've been told.
- Well.
I admire that in a woman.
- Oh-- I like that little bra that you're wearing.
Oh.
and I liked your split pea soup.
- Oh.
thanks.
- I got a little taste when you shoved my face in the rug.
Hey.
do you have a shirt that I could borrow to wear for the elevator ride?
Oh.
yeah.
You know what?
I have-- I have a great turtleneck that'll cover up that welt-- that I gave you.
Oh.
really?
- Do you like blue?
- Yeah.
Straight guys have gotta be out of their minds.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Nope.
Nope.
No.
No.
- No.
- Oh.
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
"Intimate Portrait of Molly Ringwald".
And we're stopping because?
Just to absorb the shock.
It's official.
They've run out of intimate people.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Jack.
warn people before you do that.
Oh God.
That reminds me.
Will.
- We're out of ricotta cheese.
- Mmm.
I haven't worked out in two days.
I'm fat.
Je suis fatty gay.
I got busted at the gym.
For what.
feeling something other than "the burn"?
Block.
Thanks.
Grace.
No.
they finally got hip to the fact that I have an illegal membership card.
It's about time.
You've been "Juan Mendez" for like three years now.
Poor Juan.
sitting around wondering what happened to his wallet.
his thighs dimpling.
This isn't funny!
I have to work out.
I come from a very fat family.
We store more fat than otters.
Well.
why don't you join our gym?
Oh.
no-no-no.
He-- He couldn't afford our gym.
Oh.
no-no-no.
It's easy.
Will has an extra buddy pass.
It's good for a month.
That is actually not my buddy pass.
That's my things-to-do list.
Oh.
Iook at number one here.
Pinch Grace.
Ow.
Put the kettle on.
Mary.
We're goin' to the gym!
Ow!
Let's work out during the day buddy.
Unemployed guys are so much hotter.
Eh.
Jack?
It's not really that kind of a gym.
You know.
I've got a lot of clients that work out there.
I've been known to do business there.
and you won't find anybody dancing on a box.
You're just afraid I'm gonna cut into your gym action.
Listen to me.
I'm talking like a crazy person.
Okay.
you should have warned me they let naked old men walk around in here.
Would you keep it down?
Ooh.
Iook.
there's a guy over there who can bench 300 pounds.
and I'd like to be a 160 of 'em.
- Hello.
press this.
- No.
Listen Swishburger.
this is not like your old gym.
Look around.
Nary a nipple ring in sight.
No men in Flashdance collars.
And behold.
women!
There were women at my old gym.
Not on their birth certificate.
Fine.
fine.
Let's just do some crunches then.
Fine.
- What's that?
- What?
I'm wiping off my mat.
Well.
do you have to do the little flourish?
It's like we're doing the Mikado here.
Just-- gimme-- wipe the mat.
Wow.
Somebody's sports bra's a little snug.
- I'm just saying is it so hard-- - Will?
Richard.
that's weird.
- I was just thinking about you.
- What were you thinking?
- I'm thinking we should get together and-- - Hello.
there.
I'm Here's the thing.
There's just a few sticking points on the Fellner merger.
I'm not at all happy with the contracts.
Well.
fine.
We'll get together sometime next week.
- Good.
- Thanks.
counselor.
A little rusty.
but I'm impressed.
You've still got the moves.
Truman.
What are you talking about.
crazy?
You know.
swoopin' in with the old "jock block".
The what?
The jock block.
Will.
or as they say.
south of the border.
"EI jocko blocko".
You're gonna have to help me here.
I don't speak pidgin homo.
The jock block.
Will.
Hello.
You saw me goin' for that guy.
and you cut me off at the pass.
Oh.
Busted.
That's exactly what I was doing.
Jack.
Yeah.
yeah-yeah-yeah.
Shielding a desirable carcass from a much hotter vulture.
This is what happens when you watch "Wild Kingdom" and gay porn with picture-in-picture.
No.
I will not lower my voice.
You're my husband!
Who the hell else am I gonna yell at?
!
Yeah.
I know what I saw.
Stan.
You were looking at her.
Oh.
or maybe you were looking at.
I don't know.
a lamp.
then her ass just got in the way!
- Karen.
maybe I should-- - Sit!
I'm sitting.
Karen: What?
No.
No-no-no.
No more from you.
Stan.
You're done.
I said that'll do.
you unibrowed freak!
God.
I am so sick of Stan.
Karen.
maybe you should talk to your shrink about this.
My shrink?
Honey.
I only go to him for refills.
Maybe-- maybe you just need a night away from Stan.
Well.
the nights are definitely worse.
His new thing is garlic pills.
Oh-- No.
Karen.
what-- what I meant was call one of your girlfriends.
Go out and have fun.
You're right.
Maybe I should call someone and do something.
Did you want to - do something with-- - Oh.
no-no-no.
honey.
no.
- Oh.
right.
Of course.
- No.
Oh But if I did.
what would that be?
Um You could come over this weekend.
We could hang out.
watch movies talk.
Talk?
And how would that go?
Well.
Nell you might say something.
and I might respond.
And if it were interesting enough.
you might be moved to-- Say something back?
Yes!
Yes!
- You've done this before.
- Oh-- Well.
once at Betty Ford.
but it just got boring.
Okay.
her.
Could I ever have a body like hers?
She appears to be of Nordic descent.
They tend towards the lithe and bosomy.
so as to help their buoyancy whilst navigating down the fjords.
So no?
Grace.
you don't want that kind of a body.
You're a heartier peasant stock.
Yours is a body built for-- - What.
Iinebacking?
- No.
no.
You know.
picking and carrying baskets of onions to market-- on your head.
What are you doing to me?
Oh.
relax.
If this were 1805.
you'd be the hottest babe in the shtetl.
Okay.
this is how that should have gone.
I ask you if I could ever have that body.
and you say.
"Why would you want to go down a notch"?
Maybe I'm just working through some of my anger towards you.
- What did I do?
- You inflicted Jack on my gym life.
You're mad at that?
You know my new client.
Richard Keller?
He's in here the other day.
and of course Jack has to meet him.
And then he accuses me of trying to prevent him from picking the man up.
- You jock blocked him?
- No.
I didn't-- How do you know the jock block?
Oh.
jeez.
I overheard it at the salon.
"Those gay fellas are a real hoot".
What do you mean.
how do I know?
I know.
I didn't block anyone's jock.
Richard is straight and he is a new client.
And Jack was just being Jack.
You're overreacting.
Who cares if Jack's at the gym?
Well.
sometimes he's just-- I don't know.
sometimes he is just such a fag.
Wow.
Hey.
Willie boy.
how you doin'.
man?
How's it hangin'?
Uh.
hangin' well.
Thanks for asking.
D'you catch the Knicks game last night?
It rocked.
huh?
Can't be National Butch Day 'cause the banks are still open.
Hey.
Betty.
nice rack.
- You're an idiot.
- Thanks.
Probably a lez.
huh?
You just spat on your shoe.
What are you doing?
Well.
you know the old saying.
Will.
a rolling fag gathers no moss.
What?
Yeah.
you can lead a fag to water.
but you can't make him drink.
A penny saved is a fag earned.
- Jack.
you-- - I heard what you called me the other day.
Oh.
Jack.
I'm sorry you heard that.
but you've got to understand.
I work with some of these people.
and you-- I wish you'd just tone it down a little.
You're pathetic and gross.
and there's nothing wrong with my tone.
Yeah.
except that whenever you open your mouth.
a purse falls out!
Are you afraid everybody'll find out you're gay?
- Oh-- - Oh.
- They don't all know yet.
do they?
- I don't know.
Some do.
some don't.
I don't put it on my business card.
"Will Truman.
gay.
Member since 1982".
'82?
Try '78.
Mister-One-Time-At-Sleep-Away- Camp-Doesn't-Count.
Look.
the point is.
I tell people when I'm ready.
on my timetable.
Oh.
I know what this is.
the 15 faces of Will.
Well.
Iisten.
Will.
I am what I am.
And that makes you what.
the gay Popeye?
I'd rather be a fag than afraid.
Hi.
Jack heard what I said at the gym.
Oh.
Ouch.
- What are you doing?
- Oh.
nothing.
I have a friend coming over.
I have girlfriends besides you.
- Am I a bad gay man?
- Yes.
How can you answer that so easily?
Because yesterday.
when I saw that you didn't leave me any milk for my coffee.
I remember saying.
"Bad gay man!
Bad gay man"!
It's just that Jack said this thing about how there are 15 Will Trumans.
- Oh.
that's so wrong.
- Thank you.
There are at least 25.
If you include Grumpy Morning Will.
and Disco Will.
and Sublimate-His-Rage- With-Cashmere Will-- Okay.
this is-- this is absurd.
Maybe I don't wear my sexuality Iike a sash and a tiara the way Jack does.
but I am willing to put my gayness up against anybody's.
You know what I mean.
Wow.
You're really embarrassed by Jack.
aren't you?
No.
Sometimes.
Can you blame me?
- Hmm.
- What does that mean.
"Hmm"?
Well.
you know.
sometimes the things we don't like in others.
are the things we really don't like in uh - ourselves.
- Thank you.
Princess Of Tides.
Look.
what you called Jack was pretty harsh.
I mean.
what do you say about me behind my back?
That you should never wear Capri pants.
Okay.
you keep that behind my back.
All right.
all I'm saying is.
Jack has always been your best friend.
What's changed?
Really?
I'm gonna go out.
- Agh!
- Oh.
honey.
sorry I surprised you.
Oh.
you didn't surprise me.
Hi.
come on in.
Uh.
my mother told me never to show up empty-handed.
but I didn't have time to shop.
so here's a dozen shares of GE.
Great.
I'll go put them in water.
Please.
sit.
Oh.
thank you.
- Okay.
you ready?
- Mm-hm.
I'm gonna make some popcorn.
I have Ben and Jerry's softening.
and I rented the last copy of "Hope Floats".
- I'll get the booze.
- There you go.
Okay.
ready?
Go.
Okay.
so where was l?
Oh.
yeah.
the guy was drooling all over your neck.
Oh-- Oh.
right.
the drool.
So lra is floppin' on top of me like a horny trout.
And then all of a sudden.
he lets out this scream that sounds something like "Ga-ga-ga!
Ga ga".
And phfft.
it's over.
- And that's how I lost my virginity.
- Oh-- Oh.
that is such a sweet story.
You know.
I didn't know there were people who were actually named lra.
I don't know if there are people named lra either.
but that was his name.
So what was your first time like?
Oh.
it was awful.
He kept twistin' 'em like he was trying to open up a jar of peanut butter.
But it did get me out of having to write that term paper.
Oh.
ho-ho-ho-ho!
No!
Oh.
yes.
Let's have a toast to Mr. Tyler and his big A+.
Okay.
to Mister Tyler.
He's a state senator now.
you know.
Ira's a nurse.
Did you know that you're wearing my clothes?
Yeah.
honey.
and you're wearing mine.
Ah!
I am!
When did that happen?
Well.
uh.
you wanted to try on my sweater.
and I wanted to see what synthetic fabric felt like.
and bippity-bobbity-boop.
we're wearin' each other's clothes.
Hey.
you know what?
This is kinda fun.
Yeah!
I love you!
Ah!
- Really?
!
- Uh-huh.
- I love you.

- Oh!
Hey.

I'm sorry.
Talk is cheap.
Will.
Okay.

I mean it.
Please forgive me.
No.
Or.
as they say south of the border.
no.
Jack.
come on.
You might want to scoot away from me.
If the other kids see us playing together.
they might think you're a sissy.
Won't you take me to Funkytown Won't you take me to Funkytown - I'll see you tomorrow at the meeting.
- All right.
- Move to a town that's right for me - Richard?
Wait a minute.
Uh.
before you go-- Won't you take me to Funkytown You see the guy singing "Funkytown" over there?
Yeah.
he's kind of hard to miss.
Funkytown - He's way out there.
- Yes.
he is.
I want you to meet him.
Is this about business?
No.
- Will.
I'm straight.
- Oh.
I know.
I'm not.
but it's not about that.
Come on.
Richard.
this is Jack.
my best friend.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
So.
if there aren't any other singers you want me to meet-- I'll see you tomorrow.
Jack.
Well.
that was almost a nice thing you did there.
Will Truman.
- It's a start.
- What more do you want?
I'd like you to realize that this is not about me.
this is about you.
I do realize that.
- And I'd like an apology.
- I'm sorry.
- And a little respect.
- You have that.
And a full-time membership to this gym.
- I respect you too much to pay for-- - Okay.
forget the respect.
- Just the full-time membership.
- Fine.
Ugh.
I feel sick.
I can't believe you made me eat so late.
Certain foods should only be eaten after midnight.
Iike kielbasa and stuffed derma.
Anything encased.
Anything that practices "safe pork".
Sufferin' Sappho.
It's a shame.
An image like this is completely wasted on us.
I don't want to be here when they wake up.
Let's see if we can make last call.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
What do you think of this?
What do you think of this outfit?
- It's fine.
- Fine means crap.
- It's good.
- Good means fine.
Well.
if good means fine and fine means crap.
doesn't that mean that good means crap?
The most important interview of my career and you're doing a little word puzzlies?
I'm changing.
You don't freak out about your outfits.
do you.
Iittle leprechaun?
Headline: "I'm in love".
I must have missed that headline.
Then again.
I don't read the farm report.
His name is Ramon.
Thank you for asking.
He's from the Dominican Republic.
That's on the island of Hispaniola.
I'm lovin' and learnin' at the same time.
I'm listening and not caring at the same time.
Poor.
poor jealous you.
stuck inside the nunnery while all the other girls run around in their miniskirts and take the pill.
How do you solve a problem like Will Truman?
Oh.
Iook.
it's Mother lnferior.
Okay.
I need shoe help.
This one says I'm confident and capable.
This one says I spend way too much money on shoes and I'm worth it.
- Mmm.
- What do you think?
Let me see the other one.
- Now the other.
- The other.
- No.
the other.
- Now.

Sunshine and rain.

I'm not auditioning for the road company of "Babes in Boyland".
This is my chance to design Nathan Barry's house.
The publicist?
That man ruined my career!
Wait.
wait.
wait.
You had a career and you didn't tell me?
I sent him a flyer to "Just Jack".
But did he come to "Just Jack".
where he would have been comped and given a drink coupon?
No.
Three people saw "Just Jack".
Two of them were just us!
Sweetie.
come on.
You gotta calm down.
You look great.
You are great.
You can get this.
All you have to do is figure out the one thing that you can bring to the table that nobody else can.
and then you just do whatever you have to do to close the deal.
okay?
You go out there and you knock 'em dead.
Our little girl's going out to face the world.
Mmm.
With two different colored shoes on.
Grace!
Next.
Oh God.
I want this job.
I can get it.
I can get it.
Oh.
Iook.
Donna Karen's got a new fragrance.
Oops.
Missed again.
Donna.
DKPU.
Wow.
She must have opened with "What about wicker"?
She wasn't even in there long enough to show her book.
Oh.
come on.
She didn't have to show him her book.
She was wearin' a Joan Rivers bee pin.
Grace.
stop fidgeting.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just remember to let me do the talking.
No.
I'm the designer.
You are the odd woman I pay to insult my clothes.
I'll be doing the talking.
Suit yourself.
Speaking of which-- -  - Hmm.
No.
no.
we want that meeting.
Right.
well.
you make it happen.
- Antonia Hutt?
- No.
Grace Adler from Grace Adler-- - Antonia Hutt?
- No.
Alex.
why didn't I get Antonia Hutt?
I love her work.
Marrakech?
Well.
then I hope she gets bit by a scorpion.
So do l. It'll mean one less designer to compete with.
Book.
please.
Um.
this is a pied-à-terre I did last spring.
Uh.
that's a house I did on Long lsland.
That was actually published in-- okay.
you're a skimmer.
I should have known.
You have a skimmer's build.
I don't really do humor.
And I really don't like it in others.
Oh.
I'm not funny.
Ask anyone.
I'll vouch for that.
Do I know you?
Did we meet at Sharon and Todd's for Michael's party?
No.
I couldn't make it to Sharon and Todd's.
But I was at Kate and Adam's for Robert's opening.
I just saw Robert last week at Barbara and Fred's.
Oh.
I don't even talk to Barbara and Fred anymore.
Not since the Eve and Dennis debacle.
I live for Eve and Dennis.
I saw them last night.
We were with Sally and Eric.
Nicki.
Donald.
Suzette and Peter.
We went to Elaine's.
Oh.
I went to Elaine's once-- with Frieda and Sam.
The Jacobsons?
Friends of my parents.
All right.
Iisten.
honey.
We can't stand around and chit-chat all day long.
Does she have the job or not?
- I like you.
- Hmm.
If you ever find yourself not working for her-- Oh.
Nate.
I find myself not working for her all the time.
So.
come on.
Nate.
What's the skinny?
- I need to see your home.
- My home?
Don't do that.
Don't buy time by repeating what I say.
I need to see where you live.
Why would I hire a designer who lives in a dump?
I'm not buying time by repeating what you say.
I know you have to see where I live.
Why would you hire a designer who lives in a dump?
Here's the address.
honey.
Come by her dump tonight.
Uh.
yeah.
why don't you come by around-- - I'll be there at 8:00.
- Great.
8:00.
Don't be late.
Don't do that.
Don't rhyme.
- Karen?
- Hmm?
You know how you show up late.
don't do any work around the office.
don't know how to use the fax or the computer and spend your day criticizing what I wear?
- Yeah.
- Keep doin' that.
Damn it!
Stand!
Oh my God.
I can't get the lily to stand up straight.
Really?
Even after you yelled at it?
What a disobedient lily.
Maybe you should spank it.
Maybe you should spank it.
Hey.
nervous.
No one is gonna notice one wayward lily.
Relax.
He's gonna love the place.
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.
Don't touch anything.
You know what I mean.
It's arranged perfectly in there.
I can't make any promises.
Grace.
I may have to lift the toilet seat.
But I'll make mental note of where it was and put it back exactly as I found it.
Nathan.
hello.
- May I take your coat?
- No.
Okay.
I get it.
It's a look.
Um.
may I offer you a drink?
Oh.
God.
no.
I'm having drinks with friends.
Well.
I've seen what I need to see.
Good night.
Grace Adler.
I'll let you know on Monday.
Oh.
you must be Nathan.
Will Truman.
Welcome to our home.
Well.
I suppose I could stay for a bit.
I really wanted to get my parents a very special gift for their anniversary.
but I think cash is so much more personal.
- Don't you?
- Mmm.
You do.
Where's your washroom?
Oh.
it's just behind you.
Thanks.
It's going well.
right?
Yeah.
it's going fine.
I hope you get the job.
but this guy is a creep.
My God.
he puts the "noxious" in obnoxious.
Actually.
he puts the "ob" in it.
too.
Well.
I have to go now.
Good night.
Will.
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nathan.
Grace Adler.
walk me to the elevator.
please.
That's not really an indication of what I'd do for you.
of course.
- It's specific to Will and l-- - Is he involved right now?
Will?
Oh.
um.
no.
Not at the moment.
I think maybe I'll let you work for me.
Grace Adler.
How can I get rid of the "maybe"?
Did you get a sense that Will was interested in me?
Because I did.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Yes.
I am very attracted to your roommate.
I want him to call me and I want you to make that happen.
Will that be a problem?
- Do I have the job?
- Is he gonna call me?
- Do I have the job?
- Is he gonna call me?
- Do I have the job?
- Is he gonna call me?
-  - Yes.
- Then yes.
- Okay-- - So?
- I got it.
Tell me.
I'll tell you later.
Oh.
come on.
What did he say?
What did you say?
Did you bring something to the table that nobody else could?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
see?
What was it?
You.
Jack: Come to lunch.
Karen's in the car waitin'.
She's payin'.
You know.
Jack.
one of the perks of working is that you don't have to do this when somebody buys you lunch.
Aw.
somebody's not happy because somebody has to date a pig.
That's not funny.
That's not.
wait.
Iet me think about it just for a minute.
Yeah.
it's pretty funny.
actually.
Yes.
I'm having one date with Nathan Barry.
must you find humor in my pain?
You know what's going to happen.
Mmmmmm What's that?
Ree-ree You and I have very different ideas about what a first date entails.
But they all involve the goodnight kiss.
Yeah.
well.
I can assure you this one will not.
Hey.
come on.
boys.
What's the hold-up?
I only get four hours for lunch.
Karen.
wait a minute.
Come on in.
Will.
you want to know how to get through this date?
I'll show you.
Oh.
honey.
You still doing the law thing?
Will: Hmm.
Honey.
you still doing the l-married-for-love thing?
No.
Okay.
focus.
All right.
the key to dating the undesirable is visual-ization.
All right.
now it's the end of the evening and Karen.
who is totally smitten with me at this point-- thank you very much-- awaits a goodnight smooch.
Oh.
Lord.
Jack.
I just reapplied.
And as she leans in-- Ieaning.
thank you-- I don't see Karen.
I see Dawson's Creek heartthrob James Van Der Beek.
Now.
this is an image that works for me.
okay?
Utilizing my powers of concentration.
I am now able to kiss James.
I mean Karen.
No.
I mean James.
See?
Any disgust I may feel is now eased by visual-ization.
You know.
I think I may join you for lunch-- 'cause here comes breakfast.
I know what you mean.
Politically.
I'm tolerant of the heterosexual lifestyle but the actual act is rather revolting.
So Dominick was just up the beach from me.
and Jerry and her brood were next door.
so I spent most of my vacation time hiding.
I don't know who Dominick and Jerry are.
Don't do that.
I'm not playing that.
You know which Dom and Jerry I'm talking about.
Oh.
right.
right.
right.
Dom and Jerry.
I always forget which one's the cat and which one's the mouse.
- They're both cats.
- Ah.
Excuse me.
this chicken is in strips.
I asked that you cube it.
You could get it right.
I'm here enough.
- How tough is it to cube a chicken?
- Well.
Iet's see.
Chicken times chicken times chicken-- No.
no.
no.
no.
Silly doesn't really work for me.
Well.
good thing I left my whoopie cushion in my other pants.
No.
no.
Give it some air.
It'll open right up for you.
Air.
So what are you working on now?
You know what I'm working on.
Don't do that.
I'm not doing that with you.
Okay.
Iet's try Potent Potables for 200.
You've seen the photography exhibit at MOMA?
Oh.
come on.
Iet's not go there.
Stay in the moment.
You can still win me over.
Smaller cubes.
So.
you're some kind of a lawyer?
Oh.
come on.
don't do that.
Don't go there.
I'm not doing that with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not following you.
I was just playing with you.
How boring.
Do you enjoy playing games?
Yeah.
I'm a big game player.
One of my favorites is the being-nice-to-waiters game.
Yeah.
if you win.
you get to not go to hell.
You are so like Tom.
Tom who?
!
Who is Tom and why don't these people give you their last names?
Wow.
You are arrogant.
Be careful.
Will Truman.
You wouldn't want to offend me and force me to rethink Grace Adler.
Are you kidding me with this stuff?
!
Nobody actually says something like that they're twirling a moustache and tying Lillian Gish to the train tracks.
- Check.
please.
- I'll take the check.
- No.
give it to me.
- I have more money than he does.
- Yeah.
but I'll tip you.
- And we have a winner.
Hi.
Hi.
He called.
Ugh-- Grace.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't control myself.
It's just.
outside of a circus contortionist.
he's the only man I ever met that could actually blow smoke up his own ass.
He's pretty bad.
So he fired you?
Actually.
he doubled my budget.
He doub-- that's fantastic.
Why are you eating a Ding-Dong?
I did something bad.
- Tell me.
- You don't want to know.
Honey.
after a date with Nathan Barry.
nothing could be that bad.
- Even a second date with Nathan Barry?
- Wait.
what?
'Cause I told him you would go out with him again.
Grace?
What-- Will.
he loved you!
Ugh He said it turned him on the way you were totally direct with him and-- and put him in his place.
Yeah.
well.
Iet me be totally direct with you.
I would rather go out with an Ebola-riddled gibbon monkey than this guy.
Hell.
I'd rather go out with Pat Buchanan than this guy.
Will.
please.
Please?
Remember how you told me to do whatever it takes to get this job?
I'm still doing that.
- I can't believe you're using me like this.
- Just one more date.
By then.
the only thing he'll want to fluff is the curtains.
Oh.
come on.
Will.
I've done things for you that are just as bad as this.
without even batting an eye.
Name one!
I won't belittle this with examples.
Will.
Will.
Will.
please.
Please.
I'm begging.
One more date.
Please?
Unless he wants a third.
For God's sake.
Grace.
why don't you just dress me up in fishnet stockings and thigh-high boots?
You'd do that?
This isn't right.
I should be designing this place.
Hey.
fellas.
Either sweat less or crack a window.
huh?
I can't believe Will blew this for me.
It's so ridiculous.
I wasn't prostituting him.
All I asked was that he make himself romantically available to someone he doesn't particularly like so I could make a little money.
He wouldn't even do that!
Hey.
what's going on?
Did we get fired?
Where have you been?
I've been talking about this all day.
Oh.
spring edition.
You've been nothing but a series of hoots and clicks to me since breakfast.
Well.
we haven't officially been fired yet.
but Will refuses to go out with Nathan again.
so-- - So he fired you?
- Well.
not yet.
but-- Well.
wait.
Honey.
wait a minute here.
Listen.
you know how you get a year's supply of Omaha steaks every time you buy a Bentley?
Um.
no but I'm very interested where this synaptic misfire's gonna land.
Grace.
you are the luxury automobile.
Will's just a piece of meat.
Are you really so insecure about your work that you don't realize that Will is just the free gift with purchase?
But Nathan would have never given me the job-- Oh.
bu-bu-bu bu-bu-bu bu-bu-bu-bu-da-da-ga-ga- go-go-too too-- Honey.
I'm usually not this sensitive.
Ride the wave.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe Nathan Barry might let you keep your job because you're a good designer?
!
- You know.
you're right.
- Yeah.
I mean.
people hire me all the time and they love my work.
I mean.
why would Nathan blow all this money if he didn't really think that I knew what I was doing?
I am a Bentley!
- Okay.
I'll go out with him.
- Oh.
thank God.
He would have fired my ass just as sure as I'm standing here.
I called him.
He's on his way over.
There's a few things I want to say to him first.
Talk to him.
don't talk to him.
I respect anything that you think you need to do.
I can't get you out of my head.
I want to live here.
I want to have cats with you.
- Whoa.
whoa.
whoa.
Hold it.
- No.
Iet me finish.
White Siamese.
I've already got them named.
Grizabella and Skimbleshanks.
The railway cat.
Okay.
problem.
Warm and fuzzy doesn't work for me.
You can go now.
Grace Adler!
We need to discuss wallpaper!
Oh.
yeah!
That was good!
That was good-- Okay.
you don't care.
But Grace is gonna love that.

Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
- You would have gotten that.
right?
- Says "Psycho" to me.
- See?
Why'd you give up so fast?
- Because-- because we have a really big day and.
we have to go.
- Honey.
we're in the middle of a game.
- Big day.
Rob!
Oh.
right.
Tomorrow is a big day.
I wish it were a small day.
but it's not.
It's just big.
That would make it "Big Wednesday".
- I want to go.
- Okay.
Okay.
well.
bye.
It was uh-- Hey.
it was really fun.
- Yeah.
good seeing you.
- Yeah.
really good seeing you.
- Really.
really good seeing you.
- Okay.
Grace.
You win.
So what's with Rob and Ellen?
I think they felt bad about losing.
Well.
I wish they wouldn't take it so seriously.
- Yeah.
it's just a friendly game.
- Yeah.
- We kicked their asses.
huh?
- Like the dogs they are.
Oh.
yeah.
So uh.
what kind of work do you do here?
Hmm.
Honey.
silk collar.
blue collar.
They don't even mix in the washing machine.
Lady.
I'm only trying to make polite conversation here.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah-- fix the heat.
Our relationship is already too involved.
Next thing I know.
I'm gonna be gettin' Christmas postcards from you and your red-eyed brood.
Hi.
Kare-- Oh.
well.
Iook at that.
"Butt Crack Theater".
Let's just hope it's a one act.
Okay.
I need to borrow $300.
I want to be the first one in my prayer circle to have the new Birkenstock slip-ons.
Yeah.
Well.
keep prayin'.
Mary.
'cause you're not gettin' it from me.
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Jack denied?
What's going on with you?
Did someone throw another bucket of blood on one of your furs?
I'm gonna-- No.
honey.
I-- I had a near-death experience last night.
Wow.
Did you see God?
Is she mad at me?
Come on.
Jack!
This is serious!
I was at The Palm last night with Stan and he started choking on his rack of lamb.
Well.
my first instinct was to watch it play out.
but he was really attracting attention.
Oh my God.
is he okay?
Oh.
yeah.
He's fine.
Javier.
the busboy gave him the Heimlich.
Gosh.
I should probably get him something as a thank you.
Maybe the rest of his family from Cuba.
My God.
Karen.
that's awful.
I mean.
to watch your husband almost choke to death right in front of your very eyes-- Sidebar?
That outfit is fabiola.
Isn't it?
I got it in three colors.
Oh.
honey.
it was a wake-up call.
I don't know what I would do without Stan.
I mean.
what is the combination to the wall safe?
Where is the key to the safe deposit box?
What if he did something stupid and left all of our money to some school or something?
I mean.
Iook at me.
I'm still shaking.
My cousin Rosie once choked on a piece of sausage bread.
Oh.
that's lovely.
You should remember that and tell it at dinner parties.
Oh.
I'm so on edge.
Well.
Karen.
if you had invited me to dinner-- which you didn't.
thank you very much.
busy anyway-- I could have saved Stan's life.
I know CPR.
- You know CPR?
- Oh.
yeah.
I had to do it on my father when I told him I was gay.
Only I think it just confused him even more.
What brings you guys here?
Well.
we were having lunch around the corner and we thought we'd stop by.
Yeah.
a little bit of bad news.
We're not gonna be able to make it to dinner tonight.
Oh.
you're kidding.
How come?
Well.
it's just-- I have a-- - We have to-- - Say it.
When we play with you guys.
I don't have fun.
She doesn't have fun.
Will.
Why not?
I mean.
they're just friendly little games.
No-no.
Bare-knuckle boxing is a friendly little game.
Charades is a vicious blood sport for Grace.
We love hanging out with you guys.
but when it comes to games.
you know.
she's too intense.
When we played Pictionary last week.
she laughed so hard at my drawings.
- I cried on the way home.
- She cried on the way home.
Will.
Well.
that's just Grace showing enthusiasm.
Everybody gets that way when they're winning.
don't they?
- We wouldn't know.
Will.
- Mm-mm.
I'll talk to her.
Okay?
Come to dinner and worse comes to worst.
we don't have to play a game.
We can watch TV or something.
Charlton Heston's on Leno tonight.
We can watch Moses extol the virtues of semi-automatic weapons.
So uh.
did you talk to Will today?
Ah.
he left a couple of messages for me.
but I couldn't return his call.
- 'cause guess where I was.
- Where?
I was at-- actually.
Iet me tell you this way.
Three words.
First word.
Small word.
- If.
in..
- Uh.
a - Ick.
ill.
is..
- Is - Him - Is He.
uh-- ah.
okay.
Let me give you a little hint.
Um.
it's the single most common word in the English language.
- And I just used it twice.
- Is?
- I?
- The!
The first word is "the".
Okay second word.
- Grace.
I beg you.
please just tell us.
- Yeah.
use your words.
Grace.
Okay.
- I went to the toy store.
- Oh.
And I got the new Deluxe Scrabble!
We could play like a marathon game.
What do you think of that?
I think you should return your damn phone calls.
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
what's goin' on?
Well.
Grace is making dinner and she just bought Deluxe Scrabble.
She bought a game.
Will.
- I see.
- Mmm.
Well.
I'm just gonna fix myself a deluxe drink and then we'll have a long.
Ieisurely dinner and see if we even get to Scrabble.
- Oh.
we'll get to it.
- Huh?
Today I found a couple of words that are worth a ton and they're each only four letters.
I'm guessin' Rob and Ellen are thinkin' of a couple of choice four-letter words of their own right now.
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna gut 'em like fish.
Grace.
I don't think we should play a game.
Why not?
You get a little too competitive.
- No.
I don't.
- Yes.
you do.
- No.
I don't.
- Yes.
you do.
Okay.
see.
I'm stopping.
You see?
When you play games.
you just-- you can't control yourself and it's-- it's upsetting our friends.
Is that true?
Oh.
Grace.
you are such a dear friend.
But um-- Rob?
We don't really like playing games with you.
- It's nothing personal.
but you taunt-- - And you gloat-- And you're aggressive.
God.
you're just so competitive.
You like to compete.
Grace.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
wait.
Well.
why is this all on me?
- What about Will?
- What do you mean.
"What about Will"?
You're just as competitive as I am.
- No.
I'm not.
- Yes.
you are.
Okay.
wai-wai-wait!
Now.
I like to win just as much as the next guy.
but at least I know how to control myself.
Oh.
oh.
And I don't?
ls that it?
I see.
Well.
if no one wants to play with me.
then I'm just gonna go to my room and play with myself.
By myself.
I meant by myself.
Katie.
Katie.
are you okay?
No-no-no.
Kare.
Her name is Annie.
Resusci-Annie.
Or in a perfect world.
Resusci-Andy.
Honey.
I can't remember my kids' names.
okay?
What's goin' on?
What do I do?
How do I bring it to life?
Oh.
wait.
That sounds like me on my wedding night.
Okay.
Karen.
Focus.
all right?
Here is a little acronym that'll help you.
CTA-PTN-TTH-ABM-TM.
Here's a little acronym for you.
honey.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
CTA.
Check the airway.
PTN-- Good.
Pinch the nose.
TTH.
Tilt the head.
And ABM-TM.
And begin mouth-to-mouth.
CTA-PTN-T.
TH-A Hey.
hey.
honey.
honey.
I'm not putting my mouth on this thing.
Who knows what those paramedics use these dolls for while they're sittin' around waitin' for a fire?
Besides.
these lips don't touch anything in a track suit.
Karen.
even fashion victims can be choking victims.
Are you sure?
Maybe it's nature's way of thinning out the herd.
Don't say that.
Every human life has value.
Come on.
just do it.
do it.
Come on.
Oh.
all right.
all right.
Oh.
yeah!
Will Truman is "Lord Of The Lanes".
Okay.
Ellen.
your turn.
- Come on.
honey.
- Don't psyche me out.
Rob.
Sorry.
- Yay!
Yay.
for me!
- Oh!
- Yay.
you!
- Oh.
way to go.
Miss Ellen.
Woo!
- Oh.
that was great.
- Yeah.
- Gracie.
you're up.
- Yeah.
go.
Grace.
And remember.
only Grace can put the grace in gracious.
Or something like that.
Go on.
- Come on.
Grace.
- Go.
Grace.
Do that thing.
There she goes.
There she goes There she went.
What-- what-- what-- what was that?
I knocked two pins down.
Yeah.
I know.
and you left eight standing.
but this isn't golf.
You want high numbers.
That's what you want.
high.
I know.
But look at me.
Will.
I'm fine.
I suck.
but I'm fine with it.
This must be what it feels like to be my middle sister.
I'm glad that you got that out of your system.
but seeing as you're the baby daughter looking for daddy's approval.
how about pickin' up the spare?
Pick up the spare.
How about that?
Three.
So this is like Bowler's Anonymous.
"one pin at a time"?
Hey.
Grace.
You are doing great.
baby.
Lovin' the new you.
- They're loving the new me.
- Lovin' the new you.
We can actually win this.
Okay.
Iady.
I'm almost done here.
Enough with the "Iady".
all right?
I'm not an lrish Setter.
-  -  Oh.
honey.
no.
Why are you grabbing your heart like that?
Uh.
come on.
no-no-no.
I'm sure it's just a stress thing.
Yeah.
it'll go away.
Just walk it off.
There you go.
See?
- Yeah.
you're gettin' better now.
-  -  - Uh-oh.
Oh.
Lord.
Help me!
Help me!
I've got a beached ltalian in my office!
Criminy.
Okay-- Bernie.
Bernie.
are you okay?
Thank God there are no security cameras in here to catch this.
Damn it!
You should be proud of yourself.
You saved a life.
Oh.
well.
as I always say.
every human life has value.
Oh-- But it was nothing.
really.
Just giving the breath of life.
And these puppies are full o' life.
Well.
you uh.
did a good job.
ma'am.
Oh.
well.
thank you.
That's sweet.
Well.
I'll see ya.
Oh.
uh.
but-- but uh.
I'm not really sure I was doing it correctly.
I don't suppose that maybe you'd walk me through it.
I want it to be perfect.
Oh.
certainly.
That's my job.
Oh.
well.
great.
Let me just uh.
be your dummy.
Karen.
congratulations!
Oucha-magoucha.
How you doin'?
Honey.
do you think you could give Dr. Goodbody and I a few more minutes?
You know.
I'd love to.
but Stan your husband-- You remember Stan your husband?
Yeah.
he's down in the car.
With the kids.
and the nanny and the goiter.
His mother's here?
Oh.
damn it.
I gotta go before Stan invites her to stay for the weekend.
Take care.
Hi.
I'm Jack.
I'm her CPR instructor.
but I'm not quite sure I'm getting it.
I'll be your doll.
Resusci-Jack.
Strike!
I got a strike!
- We dominate!
- Woo!
Four words!
Sounds like!
- We're kickin' your ass!
- Boom!
Oh.
oh-- Ooh.
ooh.
ooh-- You okay?
God.
I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- You okay?
Okay.
cool.
Woo!
All right.
Ellen.
you are doing great.
She's bowling so great.
- Wasn't that great.
Will?
- Okay.
you're up.
Grace.
Okay.
And now's your chance to tie us-- if you knock down 27 pins.
And there's only 10 down there.
Yeah.
honey.
that was the joke.
Okay.
now.
Grace.
Iosing gracefully is good.
Winning gracefully-- much better.
Lighten up.
honey.
It's just a game.
I know.
it's just a game.
The neon wackiness tells me that.
What are you doing?
I wanted to see if the ball would make it all the way down if I just dropped it.
Okay.
I'm gonna call it.
Time of death.
7:48.
That's a good one.
Grace.
Good.
Thought it would make it.
Okay.
ice cream?
- Ice cream?
- Oh.
yeah.
- Okay.
- Excuse me.
- Hey.
hey.
hey - Yeah.
hmm?
What are you doing?
- I'm getting ice cream.
- Yeah.
yeah.
Good Humor Lady.
what's going on?
I'm having fun?
You don't have to lose to have fun.
Grace.
You're not France.
Honey.
I don't need to win.
We're losing to Rob and Ellen.
Rob and Ellen!
We've never lost to them at anything!
Well.
maybe it's their turn to win.
It's never their turn.
They don't win.
they lose.
That's why we love them.
It's the whole basis of our friendship.
Yeah.
we get together and we have pleasant little evenings with games and then we - gut them like a fish!
- Aha!
- Nailed!
- What?
- Nailed!
- Not nailed.
- Totally nailed.
- What?
You can't control your competitive nature any more than I can.
- Oh.
that is-- - Yes.
you-- you just like to play the cool Will Truman while I'm all the intense crazy one.
But once the bowling shoe is on the other foot.
Iook who's the good cop and look who's the bad cop.
That is the worst mixed metaphor you have ever uttered.
You know I'm right.
You're just as competitive as I am.
and you can't control it any more than I can.
- Not true.
- True.
- Okay.
fine!
- True.
I admit it.
We're the same woman.
okay?
I'm gonna need a little more.
You're right.
I'm just as competitive as you are.
I love it when you're obnoxious.
It unnerves our foes and it satisfies my lust for victory.
- Okay.
you happy?
- Yeah.
thank you.
Could we get out there and try to win this thing?
- Absolutely.
- Okay.
Oh.
and by the way.
once you let Jeannie out of the bottle.
there's no way she's goin' back to that little circle couch.
- So you're sure?
- Come on.
Iet's go.
Loser's are buyin' drinks and I got a winner's thirst!
She's got a winner's thirst.
Will.
Oh.
I'm sure.
Make 'em cry.
Gladly.
This good sportsmanship crap has been making me sick.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
What do you think of this?
Too cute?
Oh.
not at all.
I just-- I worry that the ragtag group of French pirates you stole it from are gonna riddle our home with cannon fire.
Will.
don't you know the old adage?
Guys who wore jellies shouldn't throw stones.
Touché!
- So who are you goin' out with?
- Uh.
just a guy.
Who?
Stay there.
I want to change my shirt.
Hi.
Will.
it's Jack.
Listen.
two things.
very important.
I got--  - Hi.
it's me again.
I-- -  And one more thing.
you're never gonna believe who gave me--  Grace.
hey.
it's Danny.
Just confirming tonight.
If I don't hear from you.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Okay.
this better work.
'cause it's either this or the peach bridesmaid's dress.
So you're not gonna tell me who this guy is?
- It's really no big deal.
- No.
come on.
I'm just curious.
I mean.
is it a blind date.
or a new client or I don't know.
your ex-fiancé who you wasted two years of your life with until you finally came to your senses and left him at the altar.
or what?
Grace.
why are you doing this?
Why don't we try something new?
Why don't we experiment with letting me run my life?
What is that supposed to mean?
Oh.
it's just that sometimes.
Iately.
all the time.
you have a tendency.
habit.
compulsion to run my life.
Well.
excuse me for caring.
It's just that I'm the one who always has to clean up the mess.
I'm like the little guy in the circus who has to follow the elephant around with the bucket.
- That is a horrible analogy.
- You know what I'm saying.
Nobody asked for your help.
Will.
Yeah.
said the girl who dragged me home for clothing advice-- at noon!
- No.
I wouldn't go with that scarf.
- Oh.
you're right.
- So just stay out of this!
- Fine.
fine.
All you had to do was ask.
Fly solo!
Thank you.
that's what I prefer.
to fly solo!
Good!
Before you do.
I would rethink those pants.
I heard that.
So you want to have dinner tonight?
Wait a minute.
what-- what's going on here?
I like you.
Since when?
Always.
I don't like where this is going.
What?
I want your company.
Okay.
Grace has a date.
With Danny.
if you can believe that.
Oh my God.
Danny Bonaduce of the Partridge family?
Uh.
no.
Good guess.
though.
Wait a minute.
Danny.
Danny.
Danny.
Danny?
As in ex-Danny?
Mmm.
So how long did you wait before you told her it was a bad idea?
Did you bite her head off and get to the creamy center?
Rrrrr-- There is nothing wrong with sharing an opinion.
There is when you do it.
Will.
It's called meddling.
- And some of us are sick of it.
- What are you-- What is everybody talking about?
- I don't meddle.
- Oh.
no?
Let's put Will through the meddle detector.
shall we?
"Jack.
he's already in a relationship".
"Jack.
he's a member of the clergy".
"Jack.
are you sure you want to date someone with three strikes"?
Naughty boys need love.
too.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Woman: Will.
Karen and Rosario are here.
Send them in.
She's here with her maid?
Jack's intrigued.
Jack's leaving.
Buh-bye.
Oh.
come on.
Iet me stay.
Karen and I are lovers.
Karen.
come on in.
- Oh.
hi.
poodle.
- Bye.
poodle.
Here.
go buy yourself some lunch.
Okay.
keep me posted.
I want to know if Ros-- Will.
this is Rosario.
It's nice to meet you.
Okay.
come on.
honey.
Sit-o down-o.
Try not to talk-o.
You hear how she talks to me?
I speak English.
okay?
Oh.
yeah.
Except when it's time to work.
Then it's all.
"No hablo ingles".
I work like a dog.
It's not my fault that you and Mr. Stan are pigs.
They're pigs.
- I don't want to hear it.
Rosario.
- I'm not saying anything to you because  I'm nervous.
Will.
I can't live without Rosario.
Please.
you've got to help me out.
- Maybe you're better off without her.
- How can you say that.
honey?
- She's been with me for - I'm talking to Rosario.
Why do you say that about Miss Karen?
- I love Miss Karen.
- Ah.
I thought we talked about that suit.
- Okay.
Iisten.
señorita.
- Don't you start with me Ho-ho-ho.
hey-hey.
Wow.
Tonight on Springer.
"Shallow Societies and The Maids Who Abuse Them".
Look.
um.
we can apply for citizenship or get a temporary work visa.
but.
you know.
these things take time.
Short of marrying someone.
I don't see any quick solution.
Well.
how would that work?
I mean.
just for argument's sake.
Well.
she would get married.
But.
her groom to be would have to be a US citizen with no ties.
Someone who's available.
but.
you know.
not looking for a romantic entanglement.
Hey.
guys.
Iook.
I'm Will's last boyfriend.
What?
Don't you want to hear about my date last night with Danny?
None of my business.
Schmear?
- Schmaybe later.
- Schmoot yourself.
Anyway.
it was-- it was really interesting.
What a change since the last time I saw him.
He looks great.
he's happier.
he's more focused-- And he's here!
How about that?
Hi.
Danny.
'Morning.
Hey.
dude.
Hey.
Danny.
How you doin'?
All right.
I'm all right.
How about you?
You uh.
you know.
you still into guys and all that?
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
The antibiotics just didn't seem to work.
Before you say anything.
Iet me just tell you something about Danny.
okay?
He's completely different.
People do change.
Will.
and Danny has changed.
In fact.
he's changing right now.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
No.
seriously.
Will.
he really has grown.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Why don't you just punch me in the stomach?
Wow.
you can't hold back.
can you?
"Okay".
Grace.
I mean okay.
You know.
whatever you think best.
Now you're just being cruel.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that I'm an idiot for going back into a relationship that didn't work.
Well.
first of all.
how dare you call me an idiot?
!
And second of all.
did it ever occur to you that maybe we needed this time apart to figure out how important we were to each other?
Did that ever cross your mind.
huh?
Okay.
fine.
You raise a valid point.
Do people really change or are they the same football-watching.
steak-knife-giving.
I-gotta-blow-outta-here frat boy they always were?
- Ah-- - Oh!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho!
Grace.
I just said.
"Ah".
Yeah.
but clearly.
by.
"Ah".
you meant.
"Okay".
And I think we all know now what that means.
What does it mean?
!
- Tell me.
- Grace-- excuse me.
But yesterday you told me that-- that you wanted me to mind my own business.
Why do you now want to know what I think?
Because I was testing you.
And luckily.
you passed.
Because if you had given me your opinion on this very confusing issue.
I really would have been mad.
because I don't need it.
I can make my own decisions for myself.
okay?
You know what?
I gotta blow outta here.
Why don't I walk you to the door?
Yeah.
Will.
you mind if I grab a bagel?
Just-- - Whatever you think is best.
- Oh.
you're good.
So.
Iisten.
Gracie.
it was uh - it was great seeing you again.
- Yeah.
What about maybe going away this weekend?
You know what?
Never mind.
Never mind.
I forgot that to have a relationship with Grace is to have a relationship with Will and Grace.
It was always a threesome-- and not the good kind.
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.
You know.
it's funny.
I always imagined myself a December bride.
But there is something about a last-minute marriage to an illegal alien for $1000 that has a romance all its own.
Miss Karen.
I need a new dress.
I can't breathe in this.
Honey.
it fit yesterday.
before the frozen turkey mysteriously disappeared.
Jack.
honey.
take good care of my angel.
For the honeymoon.
I think I'm gonna bring Dan instead of Doug.
Rosario.
who are you gonna bring?
Oh.
Jack.
Look at you.
Is this the little girl I carried?
Okay.
I've drawn up your papers.
I need you both to review them before your meeting with the immigration people.
Speaking of which.
pop quiz: Jack.
what side of the bed does Rosario sleep on?
She sleeps in a hammock on the sun porch.
How the hell should I know?
Because if you don't know.
she's gonna be deported.
Rosario.
where does Jack work?
He's on "The Guiding Light".
Hey.
I sent them a tape of "Just Jack".
It's just a matter of time.
"Solamente Jack".
- Gracias.
- Okay.
Jack.
this is serious.
okay?
This is not like the time you pretended to be Jewish so you could get that rabbi's phone number.
Aw.
what a mistake.
A guy who can't go out on a Friday night.
Honey.
here's my credit card.
Take your bride to lunch and pump her for some intimate details.
Okay.
come on.
wifey.
It's happy hour at Boybar.
and if anybody asks.
you're a drag queen.
As long as they have chicken wings.
I'm fine.
So.
where's Grace?
I haven't seen her all week.
Mmm.
I don't know.
Somethin' about work.
I try not to get involved.
Honey.
what's this?
What's happening?
What's going on?
Nothing.
You're smelling her pencils.
I just wanted to make sure they're fresh.
All right.
save it for the laugh shack.
honey.
I'm busy.
Jack wants a monkey as the ring bearer.
See you at-- no.
I'm sorry.
it's this whole-- it's this whole Grace and Danny thing.
Does this not have "gigantic mistake" written all over it?
- I don't want to be a meddler-- - Honey.
honey.
honey I sense this is gonna go on for quite a while.
so let me just boil all this hoo-ha down to two important points.
okay?
One.
brown is over.
And two.
you need to get a life.
- You don't understand-- - Get a life.
- But I'm Grace's-- - Life!
All right.
honey.
You're done.
That's good.
Oh.
I don't see you.
This is so fun.
This is so stupid.
I look like a piñata.
Yeah.
and if I beat you with a stick.
I could watch all my money fall out.
Now.
how about a little appreciation for all of this?
All I want is my green card.
not a party I have to clean up after.
If it wasn't for this.
you'd be flying back to Cucaracha on "Air Guacamole" with live chickens runnin' up and down the aisle!
Listen.
Iady.
I'm gonna snap you like a twig and throw you in a bush.
Yeah.
I'd like to see you try.
- Is this the thanks I get?
- Why don't you shut up?
- I don't need this ingratitude from you.
- I tell you.
you're crazy lady.
Oh my God.
my little girl is getting married.
Hi.
so nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.
Oh.
you cut your hair.
It looks great.
Hi.
how's the baby?
Oh.
somebody better lighten up on the fusilli there.
huh?
I don't know a person here.
How about that?
- Oh.
something's ripped.
- Yeah.
me.
You like my new bracelet?
Danny gave it to me.
It's nice.
Thank you all for coming.
I know my husband Stan would have loved to have been here tonight.
but regrettably could not attend as he is at home watching the Knicks game.
However.
I know that he would echo my sentiments in saying.
Rosario.
by marrying Jack.
we are not losing a maid.
we are keeping a maid.
He gave it to me over dinner last night.
He cooked.
Can you believe Danny cooks now?
Hmm.
He's the bomb.
Welcome.
We are gathered here today to join this man.
John Phillip McFarland.
and this woman Rosario Ynez Consuelo Yolanda Salazar.
in the bond of holy matrimony.
And today.
Rosario and Jack take their first step on the road to true intimacy.
Shut up.
you guys!
Danny still wants to take me to the country for the weekend.
- What do you think?
- Depends which country.
Chechnya.
no.
I also think I'm falling back in love with him.
Oh.
that is beautiful.
Are you out of your mind?
Are you so intent on ruining your life?
My God.
Pamela Anderson makes better choices than you.
Gotcha!
A toaster.
Gotcha a toaster.
You're registered for that.
right?
A marriage ceremony represents one of life's I knew it.
I knew that you thought it was a bad idea.
That's why I broke up with Danny yesterday.
You wh-- why have you been baiting me for the last 10 minutes?
Because I needed to make sure that you thought Danny was still a mistake.
Of course I thought Danny was a mistake.
Well.
why couldn't you have expressed that earlier and saved me the agony of having to make my own decision?
Believe me.
Grace.
I don't want you making your own decisions any more than you do.
but you did tell me to butt out.
Oh.
don't play that game with me.
You know damn well that butt out means back off temporarily until the right moment presents itself to butt back in again.
Forgive me.
I left my Grace-to-English dictionary at home.
Next time.
just.
you know.
just tell me when to butt in and when to butt out and when to do the hokey-pokey and when to turn myself around!
Don't make me seem like the unhealthy crazy one when you're the one who wouldn't tell me what to do.
Hey.
hey.
hey.
How long have you two been married?
'Cause maybe it's been long enough.
- We're not married.
- I'm gay.
Well.
if you're not married and you're gay.
what the hell's all this about?
Wow.
Jack just married Karen's maid.
Unbelievable.
I know.
I haven't seen a kiss that uncomfortable since Richard Gere and Jodi Foster in "Sommersby".
Why do I care so much about your opinion?
Maybe because you don't trust yourself.
Big question is.
why do I care so much about how you conduct your love life?
Maybe because you've got nothing going on in your own.
Ouch.
Not untrue.
but ouch.
I want to get married.
Will.
Well.
maybe you didn't get the memo.
but l-- Not to you.
nervous.
I want to kiss a guy under one of these things.
Me.
too.
So want to see how it feels to kiss a guy under one of these things?
I don't think we should live together anymore.
The kiss wasn't that bad.
Will.
I don't think we should live together anymore.
either.
It's just when you moved in.
it was so we could heal - and then move on.
- I know.
And I don't feel like I've moved on.
Have you?
I'm standing here making out with a girl.
That's the international symbol for not moving on.
Jack!
Get your ass back out there and finish your chimichanga!
You're the host!
I don't want to!
Rosario's been doing tequila shooters and she's gettin' real handsy.
Jack: Aw.
marriage sucks.
You guys are the only ones who have it figured out.
Come on.
"Yack".
We're going back out there.
You've still gotta do the napkin dance with Rosario's mother.
Hey.
I've gotta lock up.
You think you two can move on?
Both: Yeah.
- I think so.
- I think we can.
