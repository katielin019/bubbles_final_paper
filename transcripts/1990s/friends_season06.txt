{START OF EPISODE 1}
Okay, this is it.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!
Okay!
Okay!
Oh, my God!
ls everybody getting married?
No running in the chapel.
Hey, don't you give me any of your-- Hey!
Why are you here?
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes.
Why else would we be here?
What happened?
Did we miss it?
We missed it.
Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!
This is insane.
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?
If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
If you marry here, you're married everywhere.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Oh, well.
The One After Vegas Gelula/SDI Why are we in bed together?
I don't know.
Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
-Really?
-No.
But we didn't have.
.
.
.
.
.
sex, did we?
I don't remember much about last night.
It was such a blur.
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.
Then we didn't have sex.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Morning, Pheebs.
Well, my movie has been officially canceled.
Joey, I'm so sorry.
You want my breakfast?
Too depressed to eat.
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.
I don't wanna drive back by myself.
I get lonely.
How about if you come with me?
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.
We could talk and play games.
This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
Sure?
All right, although I don't think we need one.
I never stopped loving you.
So has anybody talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
They left me a message.
They'll be here.
Where is the waitress?
I'm starving.
It's a buffet, man.
Here's where I win all my money back!
I gotta talk to you.
Sure.
What's up?
Monica and I almost got married.
My God!
That's huge!
Wait a minute.
Why wasn't I invited?
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross.
Do not say Ross.
I just don't think that Monica and I are ready yet.
I love her.
.
.
.
.
.
but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel.
.
.
.
.
.
was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.
How do I tell her without crushing her?
Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?
Girls say it to me all the time.
And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
How do I tell him that it's too soon?
He's gonna think I don't love him anymore.
-Well, you don't.
-Yes, I do.
Good.
I was just testing you.
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.
We were just talking about bacon.
No, we were talking about tennis.
Tennis is more believable.
Thank you.
Coffee.
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night?
What do you mean "Iast night"?
Nothing happened last night.
Ross invited us all to watch.
We weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.
Who got married?
You did.
What?
-Hello.
We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't.
That's ridi-- Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.
They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
They let you get married.
Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
Now, I'm drunk right now.
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
Well, I think, I think Ross already has one.
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you.
.
.
.
.
.
because we don't need to get divorced.
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
-An annulment?
Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
Oh, that's your thing!
What?
Your thing, that you're the guy who gets divorced.
No, no, that's not "my thing.
" I do not love getting divorced.
Yes, you do.
This is your third divorce.
You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it.
.
.
.
.
.
and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it.
I'm so drunk.
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.
I know I love you.
I know I love you.
Where are we on the whole "going back.
.
.
.
.
.
to where they have the marriages" thing?
I love you.
That's a good question.
Last night we let the dice decide.
We should leave it up to fate again.
I love you!
We don't get married unless there's a sign.
So say.
.
.
.
You roll another eight, then there's a sign.
.
.
.
.
.
that we should marry.
Eight we get married.
.
.
.
.
.
but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0, Sounds great.
Hey, we got a shooter.
Money, please.
-Ready?
-Ready.
Come on, eight.
Yes, yes, eight.
Eight, easy eight.
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.
Let's get married.
I guess.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding!
Damn it!
I wanted it so bad!
Wanna go pack?
We're doing the right thing.
Of course we are.
We left it up to fate.
If we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign.
Okay, you have 1 9 questions left.
Use them wisely.
Come on, Joey.
You can't win if you don't ask any questions!
What?
You promised me a fun road trip.
We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2.
We are switching, and you are going to drive back.
That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
All right.
And until then, you are going to sing to me.
Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
-Really?
-Sing!
I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night Man, this is a long drive.
Are my eyes open?
No!
Morning.
Hey.
Hey, hubby.
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing.
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.
So we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
Wow, this is so amazing.
I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Look.
.
.
.
.
.
I can't have three failed marriages.
I can't, okay?
I am not gonna be that guy.
So what, we just stay married forever?
How is this going to affect you, really?
I mean, you fill some form out once in a while.
.
.
.
.
.
instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs. " It's right next to it.
Okay.
I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?
We can stay married.
.
.
.
.
.
because I thought that the boxes were far away from each other.
All right.
Look, just.
.
.
.
.
.
please take a moment here.
.
.
.
.
.
and think about what you're asking of me.
Okay?
I am asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife.
And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid kicked me really hard.
Well, you did pull his hair.
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk.
Here.
There.
There.
Okay.
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
He could be a rape-- He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.
And, you, are you a rapist?
No.
Do you like car games?
Yeah, you know the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
I'll play.
I'll play.
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night.
Listen.
I know you wanted to talk to me.
.
.
.
.
.
but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
We register.
.
.
.
.
.
and you get to keep all the presents.
No, Ross, come on.
No, listen.
I've thought about how to tell you this.
The bottom line, Ross.
.
.
.
.
.
is, we cannot stay married.
-I don't know if that's true-- -Oh, but it is.
Okay.
You know what this is?
This is a difference of opinion.
-When that happens in a marriage-- -Ross, come on!
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!
Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.
All right.
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey, hey.
.
.
.
.
.
is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
There's the train station, where I get off.
I have your address and phone number.
I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.
So ball's pretty much in your court.
All right.
See you, Pheebs.
Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore.
Please talk to me.
Let me make it up to you.
Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown Engines on Take your protein pills And put your helmet on -This is-- -Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
That's not fair.
You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.
I promised you a fun road trip with your friend.
.
.
.
.
.
and I didn't deliver, okay?
Now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship.
So I will strive to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Thank you.
So can we play 20 Questions now?
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.
Okay.
Is it.
.
.
.
.
.
a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible!
You are the master!
Bug!
-You look like you're-- -Don't say it!
Don't even think it.
All right.
Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Should we just get married?
All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs.
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!
Go unpack.
It's been three days, and it drives me insane!
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar-- You know, I was thinking what if l. .
.
.
.
.
unpack here?
All your stuff would be here.
Well.
.
.
.
What if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay.
What if we live together, and you get what I'm saying?
Live together?
There've been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Okay.
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here's your key.
Here's your key.
Now go out and christen it!
Go out and come back in!
Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.
-Ready?
-Ready!
The key broke in the lock, and I can't get in.
Wait.
Oh, my God, I can't get out!
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!
-It's an old key!
-Oh, my God, it's old!
I love you.
I love you.
Are you hugging the door right now?
No.
Yeah, yeah, me neither.
So did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah.
No problems.
It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Do you wanna go see a movie?
-Yeah, why not?
-Pheebs?
Thanks, I've already seen one.
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.
You wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?
We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel.
See you later.
What are you doing?
Key is stuck in the lock.
I can fix it.
Hold on.
Watch out, watch out.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished.
Nice job, Joe.
You're quite the craftsman!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Did everything go okay with the annulment?
No problems.
It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Want to go see a movie?
Yeah, why not?
I'll get my sweater.
Want to hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?
We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel.
See you later.
Do you have any gum?
Wait!
Wait!
Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?
We'll be late for the movie.
There's a cab.
Taxi!
That's great.
What timing!
My God, huh?
There you go.
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.
The Angelika!
Go!
Go!
You didn't get the annulment?
!
I know.
I tried, but when I got to my lawyer's office, all I heard was: "Three divorces!
Three divorces!
" I just don't want my tombstone to read "Ross Geller: Three Divorces.
" Don't worry about that.
Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
It can say, "Ross Geller: Good at Marriage.
" You know what?
Mine's gonna say, "Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive.
" All I know is, I can't have another failed marriage.
So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
Woman.
Sorry.
Okay, so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.
Just don't say anything to Rachel.
Rachel is one of my closest friends.
But being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special.
Okay.
Okay, stop, stop!
Phoebe?
Hey, Rach!
What was that?
Sorry.
Mix-up.
How was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet.
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika!
Go!
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel Gelula/SDI When I move in, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course.
Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Did you tell him you're moving out?
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out "Joey, I have to--" Then I lose my nerve and I finish with "--go to the bathroom.
" He may think I'm sick.
I have to tell Rachel, but.
.
.
.
We just gotta get it over with.
Next time we see them, we'll just tell them.
That's it.
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?
-Pretty much.
-All right.
Hey, man, you feeling better?
We have something to tell you.
Oh, my God!
You're pregnant!
No!
Look, Joe, here's the thing.
Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
I'm gonna be moving out, man.
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations.
See you later.
Are you okay?
I gotta go.
I've got an acting job.
Like you'd believe that.
This sucks!
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you.
.
.
.
.
.
the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
If you're gonna move in with him.
.
.
.
.
.
I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
He's a terrible roommate.
Terrible.
He forgets to.
.
.
.
He always, he always.
.
.
.
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!
Hey, Pheebs.
Have you seen Rachel?
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.
You're pregnant.
No!
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, that's good!
But if you were pregnant, what would you name it?
Hint, Phoebe.
What's up?
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my little sister and my best friend.
.
.
.
.
.
shacking up.
That's great.
That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here.
Big day, huh?
People moving in.
People getting annulled.
I gotta go find Rachel.
If you see her, give her some really bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.
Something bad to tell Rachel.
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?
Can you just lay off, please?
My life is an embarrassment.
I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.
You'll have a life, you'll date-- No, I won't.
I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy.
.
.
.
.
.
Murderer Guy.
.
.
.
.
.
and geologists.
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.
That is much more important than three stupid divorces.
Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
That's not fair.
Most guys that have been divorced three times are 60.
Nobody cares about this except you.
This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
-Here, I'll show you.
Come here.
-What?
Hi.
My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.
But wouldn't you date him?
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Thought you were Rachel.
What gave me away?
I gotta tell her.
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.
It's official.
We're moving in together.
No turning back.
Are you scared?
Are you?
!
No.
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.
The worst day.
You're finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
Listen, for the first four years of my work, everybody called me.
.
.
.
-Seriously.
-I believe you.
It was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her.
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.
What?
All yours, babe.
Have a seat.
Listen, Chandler and l. .
.
.
.
.
are going to live together.
Here.
Oh, my God.
That's so great!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
And that was so sweet of you to ask.
The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
Chandler, you'll have to watch those long showers you take.
.
.
.
.
.
because you know Racquel can't be late.
He'll work on that.
This is so exciting!
Come and knock on our door We'll be waiting for you See?
Once you know the stories, it's not that bad.
First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality.
Not my fault.
Second marriage: Said the wrong name at the altar.
A little my fault.
Third marriage: They shouldn't let you get married.
.
.
.
.
.
when you're drunk and have writing on your face.
Nevada's fault.
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.
But not while he's still married.
And you, wouldn't you want to date?
I'm not dating at all anymore.
I was only dating guys that were bad for me.
So I decided that-- Good.
Good.
Whatever.
And you, Meg?
Well, I don't care about the divorces, either.
But I wouldn't date him.
It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
" This is crazy.
I mean, yes, Rachel is my good friend.
And I have loved her in the past.
.
.
.
.
.
but now, she is just my wife.
Phoebe, will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you married her.
We were drunk!
I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Now he's using this three-divorces reason.
.
.
.
.
.
because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.
I must say, well done.
Bravo, Meg.
Fine.
If this is what you think, forget about.
.
.
.
.
.
the whole three-divorce thing.
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled.
She means nothing to me.
Nothing!
Okay, now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
When will we tell Rachel what actually will happen?
Soon.
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.
Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said--!
Of course, you're my best friend.
Would you tell Rachel?
All right.
At least I'm prepared.
Oh, yes.
-They're not for you.
Are you upset?
-I am now.
Hey, roomie.
Okay, bye.
There's something important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together.
.
.
.
.
.
we meant alone together.
Oh, my God.
That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.
No, sweetie.
You know what?
This is my fault.
I wasn't clear.
I'm really sorry.
Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Don't you want a cookie?
Sure.
Thanks.
Do you need a tissue?
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.
Oh, God, they're so yummy!
It's gonna be weird when I come home and you're not here.
No more Joey and Chan's.
No more J and C's.
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't.
It's not there.
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.
We won't be able to have those long talks at night.
.
.
.
.
.
about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
Oh, yeah?
Well, how'd she take it?
Really well.
Surprisingly well.
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
All I'm asking for is a little emotion.
Is that too much to ask after six years?
What, are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?
When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
I did not cry my eyes out!
Come on, it's like the end of an era.
No more J-Man and Channy's!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
You got married again?
Yes.
So that's your second marriage in two years?
Yes.
Second in two years.
Third, overall.
I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years.
.
.
.
.
.
and never have I had so much business from one client.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said.
.
.
.
.
.
at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes, yes, yes.
But I do not love her.
That's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
I see.
Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.
We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
No problem.
We'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
There's no way to do this without her?
Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
Of course you did.
Look, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
What about someone who looks like Rachel?
I will think about the therapy.
So I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay.
No point in dragging it out.
Dragging out the long process of you moving out.
.
.
.
.
.
and us not living together anymore.
What about this?
Who gets this?
I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
-What is that?
-I don't know.
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.
Something to remember me by.
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.
We're gonna see each other all the time.
But still, it's a big change.
The end of an era, you might say.
Are you okay?
You're not blinking.
I'm fine.
I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
Oh, all right.
But I gotta say, I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time.
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?
!
Why aren't you more upset?
Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.
It's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?
You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it.
I'm sorry.
It's going to happen.
Chandler will move in here.
-But l-- -I know, just let me finish, okay?
This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
This is something that we both really want.
And it is going to happen.
It is?
Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm gonna miss you.
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.
So did you get the annulment?
I couldn't.
I knew it.
Because you love Rachel.
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated-- Complicated because of the love.
I do not love Rachel.
I'm telling her about the whole thing.
.
.
.
.
.
so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
Would I do that if I loved her?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
Oh, what's wrong?
Monica and Chandler are moving in here.
.
.
.
.
.
and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
Of course.
So Ross and Rachel got married.
Monica and Chandler almost got married.
You think we should hook up?
Oh, we do.
But not just yet.
Really?
Well, when?
Well, first Chandler and Monica will get married.
.
.
.
.
.
and be filthy rich, by the way.
But it won't work out.
I know.
Then I'll marry Chandler for the money.
And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great.
But then we ditch them and we get married.
We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
What about Ross?
I don't want to go into the whole thing.
But we have words and I kill him.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Check it out, this is unbelievable!
Joey's been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
You trying to kill me?
I want to ask you something.
Since I'm moving out, and you're so beautiful.
.
.
.
.
.
how about I move in with you?
That would be great, but what do we do about Denise?
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.
Your roommate?
Yes, Denise.
Denise!
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
What about Denise?
She cute?
How can you have a roommate that we don't know about?
Because you never listen to what I say.
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!
I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.
That's true.
Move in with me.
We can stay up late talking, and watch movies.
You know about naked Thursdays, right?
Yeah, yeah.
I think I'll find my own place.
Hey!
I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.
The One With Ross' Denial Gelula/SDI What did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Oh, that.
She took it really well.
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.
Because you're in love with her.
I am not in love with her.
She was upset about having to move out.
If she knew we were still married, she'd have been more upset.
So I comforted her.
As a friend.
You "comforted her"?
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.
A classic sign of love, the hug.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson.
" It was a hug.
Did you, or did you not, smell her hair?
Smell her hair?
What if I did?
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out of her head.
That's why women are shorter.
So that men will fall in love when they hug them.
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.
I was hugging her as a friend.
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.
She's got a lot of it, and it smells all.
.
.
all.
.
.
.
.
.
coconutty.
What?
It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.
Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.
Okay, but be careful.
Rachel's not in the same place you are.
If the place you're referring to is being in love.
.
.
.
.
.
she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.
I didn't understand that.
Maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?
I don't know.
How about "Thanks for taking the message"?
When you move in.
.
.
.
.
.
Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.
I think we should have a beautiful guest room.
.
.
.
.
.
with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers.
And comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was.
I really haven't thought about it that much.
Well, I like that idea.
.
.
obviously.
I was thinking maybe.
.
.
maybe it could be a game room.
You can buy old arcade games, like Space lnvaders and Asteroids.
.
.
.
.
.
for $200.
The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!
No.
You mean "No" as in: "What an interesting idea.
Let's discuss it before we reject it.
" I'm sorry.
Interesting idea.
But no.
So that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room.
.
.
.
.
.
filled with antiques.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect.
It's the oldest game.
What's wrong with a beautiful guest room?
I'm not against it.
Especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.
Monica and I had a stupid fight.
You're still moving in together, right?
My ad came out today.
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly.
" Nice.
I figured it'd be more interesting to have a female roommate.
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.
And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 1 9.
.
.
.
.
.
than a girl who is 1 9?
Not just a hatrack, my friend.
Pheebs, I have to ask you-- I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
I'm trying to move that pencil.
-This one?
-It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
Look.
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly.
" There's nothing.
This city is full.
Wait!
Look at this!
"Two bedroom, two bath.
Must be nonsmoker.
Satan worshipers okay.
" Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?
This guy, Warren, from the museum is going on a dig for two years.
He's got this great place he needs to sublet.
You interested?
Great!
I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.
Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago.
.
.
.
.
.
killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization.
Here's Warren's number.
This is great.
I'm gonna call him right now!
Thank you!
Okay, you go call him.
I saw it.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about what you already know but won't admit.
You love her again.
You re-love her.
I do not re-love her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it.
Promise me you won't do anything stupid.
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?
The apartment is already subletted.
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.
Live with me.
-What?
-What?
!
What?
Are you serious?
I would love to live with you.
That's great.
Thank you.
I'm just glad I could help you out.
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.
Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me.
You're my hero.
Hero?
I don't know.
Well, all right.
I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
Oh, please.
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
No.
No, I won't.
But I should tell you this.
The same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.
He said he didn't love her, but he really did.
And it just blew up.
And that's how she ended up living with me.
Okay, that's a lie.
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.
I only played those games because I couldn't get girls.
Now I can get-- Now I have you.
No, not that I think I have you.
.
.
.
.
.
or think of you as property in any sort of way.
I see women.
.
.
.
Stop it, Chandler.
I'm sorry too.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Oh, yes.
We can think of something to do with the room together.
Great idea.
We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally.
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.
Let's think about changes we can make in the living room.
Changes?
We'll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.
You're bringing the Barcalounger over here?
Is that a problem?
It's just that they're a set and should stay together.
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.
You're taking them away from their home.
I get it.
I get nothing.
Nothing here is mine.
Everything is yours.
I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes and go off to work!
Yeah, that's it.
Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?
In the game room!
It is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly.
That's fine.
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!
Everything on your application looks really good.
Just one last question.
Will your friends be over here, partying and hanging out?
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.
Don't just be blurting stuff out.
I want you to really think about your answers.
Call off the roommate search.
Hi.
I'll be living here.
Ignore him.
He's just some guy who wants the apartment.
But he's not going to get it.
You took down the shower curtain?
That thing was a hazard!
I'm very safety conscious.
I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Thanks.
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?
No, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Over a stupid room?
I feel kind of bad for them, but now I don't have to move in here!
Oh, no.
Yeah, that part's great.
What's all this about you guys fighting?
Is this really over a room?
That is so silly.
We can handle this.
Apparently not.
And I can't stand by and watch two people I care about so much.
.
.
.
.
.
be hurt by something that is so silly.
Enough of the silliness.
Tell her to stop being silly.
Two very good points.
I've known you both a long time.
And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy.
.
.
.
.
.
as you've been since you got together.
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
That is so silly.
What's more important, love.
.
.
.
.
.
or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness.
But we also have a soft spot for the love.
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "Iaughter.
" -Why do you do it?
-I don't know.
Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do.
And, Mon, you want to live with Chandler?
Yes.
A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
So I understand you're looking for a place?
No, I'm staying put.
I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why?
Where you going?
I don't know.
You won't believe it.
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?
But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah.
You know, about that.
.
.
.
I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything.
.
.
.
.
.
but don't you think it'll be weird?
Why?
Why would it.
.
.
.
Why would it be weird?
Well, you know, because of us.
Because of our history.
No!
No, no!
It would only be weird if we were still in "that place.
" Are you still in that place?
No, not at all.
Good.
Me neither.
So it's not a problem.
We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating.
Really?
We are?
Yeah.
I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend.
That'd be great.
But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system.
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door: "Come back later.
I'm getting lucky.
" Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?
That's very funny.
He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
No, I'm serious.
Think about it.
You move in.
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.
It was just a stupid fight about a room.
There are no stupid fights!
This isn't about the room.
This is about what the room represents.
And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.
Fine.
It's your life!
I just don't want to see you break up.
Which you will do if you move in together.
But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.
Don't do it!
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of wanting to live with him.
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!
The Barcalounger can go here.
You can see the TV, and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I want to show you something too.
You know those big road signs that say "merge"?
I thought we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed.
Because that's you and I together.
"Merge!
" -I love that!
-Really?
"No!
" I found you in my bed How'd you wind up there?
You are a mystery Little black curly hair Little black, little black, little black Little black curly hair If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows.
.
.
.
.
.
please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Where are the other guys?
Well, Monica and Chandler are occupied.
-Fighting?
-The other thing.
It's great they worked things out.
There's no breaking them up, is there?
Can I borrow the key to your house so I can go make a copy?
-Here.
-Thank you.
Are you sure?
Once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Now get out of here before I change my mind.
You think moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Well, maybe you should go back.
She moves in, and before you know it.
.
.
.
.
.
you're right where you don't want to be, back together.
I don't think so.
She's already talking about dating other guys.
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy.
.
.
.
.
.
and you'll be telling her, "Oh, that's okay.
You'll find someone.
" And then, bam!
She finds you!
Maybe you're right.
Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.
Is that what you want?
Is that what I want?
Yes.
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.
The place was closed, so I'll copy it later.
Or not.
Why don't you move in with me?
Whoa, Joey!
Look, I know I scared you with that whole naked-Thursdays thing.
.
.
.
.
.
but we don't have to do that.
It would be easier to move across the hall.
Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.
There's a lot of people interested in the room.
But I've narrowed it down, and you're one of the finalists.
Before I decide, I want to be sure our personalities match.
So I made up a little test.
I'll say a word, and you say the first thing that comes to mind.
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.
-Pillow.
-Fight.
Very good.
"G.
" -String?
-Excellent!
Doggy.
Kitten?
Sorry!
So close, though.
Bye-bye!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine?
This bottle opener.
-And.
.
.
?
-And it's a magnet.
Look at that!
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me.
.
.
.
.
.
and you have the one thing I don't have.
It's like, in a way, you complete me.
-Kitchen.
-What?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
I know what you're thinking.
That she'll move in with you, then fall in love with you, and then.
.
.
.
.
.
when she finds out you're already married, she'll be happy.
You know?
You're just very sad.
Oh, my God!
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!
It all adds up!
You're obsessed with her.
It's always: "What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?
When will you confess your secret marriage to Rachel"?
You want her!
Saved by the bell.
Aren't these candlesticks mine?
No, I bought those.
Oh, right.
I forgot.
That you're a liar!
That's great!
I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.
That was the head of the paleontology department.
.
.
.
.
.
at N. .
.
.
.
.
Y.
.
.
.
.
.
U.
Wow.
What.
.
.
.
.
.
did he.
.
.
.
.
.
say?
Remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate?
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?
I know!
Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.
It's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.
How great would that look on the mailbox?
Professor Geller.
Professor and Mrs. And Mrs.?
You and Ross are still married.
What?
Just kidding!
Oh, God!
Saved your ass.
The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance Gelula/SDI What's the matter?
You know that psychic I see?
She told me I'm gonna die this week, so I'm bummed.
I know you don't know about readings, but that's the worst you can get.
That's crazy.
She'd say that to you?
You don't believe her, do you?
I don't know.
She said that I'd have triplets.
.
.
.
.
.
but she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity, did she say how you'd go?
She didn't tell me I'd die till the end of the session.
I wasn't gonna waste a whole other hour there!
I've only got a week left.
I've really gotta start living now!
Hey, everyone.
Well, today's my first lecture.
.
.
.
.
.
and I wanted to try it out on you guys.
Do you mind?
No, that'd be great!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two.
.
.
" This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.
" .
.
.
subcategories.
The first of these subcategories is--" Are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No.
Why?
I never seen a guy stare so hard at something that didn't have chicks on it.
"There are three primary theories.
.
.
.
.
.
concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories.
.
.
.
.
.
can be further subcategorized.
.
.
.
.
.
into--" Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.
Wait a minute, hold the phone.
You're not talking about Chuckles University?
Come on, we're kidding.
You know what might make it less boring?
Thank you.
Some visual aids.
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.
Why not?
I don't even know why I talk to you guys about it.
I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it till I was 1 9.
Any good mail?
Something from the Screen Actors Guild.
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it?
I got.
.
.
.
"Benefits lapsed.
" That's weird.
I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.
It's not a check.
Your health insurance expired because.
.
.
-.
.
.
you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.
Oh, I can't believe this!
This sucks!
When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus.
.
.
.
.
.
or catch on fire, you know?
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?
I'm sorry.
There's never a good time to have to.
.
.
.
.
.
stop catching on fire.
All right, well.
.
.
.
.
.
I guess I gotta go see my agent.
Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
"Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
" Hey, you're still alive!
How are you feeling?
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
Oh, by the way, do you think you-- What are you doing?
Preparing you for-- Didn't you think I was dead?
Did that not come off?
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.
Can you do me a favor?
Wake me up in a couple hours.
You know, if you can.
Did you take these back?
I liked them so much that I bought some for myself.
They're really great, aren't they?
I love them.
Nice try.
How'd the lecture go?
It went great.
And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.
That's great.
I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.
I knew I just had to let the material speak for itself.
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy.
" Well, I proved them wrong!
And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!
-Hey, Estelle, listen-- -Well, well, well.
Joey Tribbiani.
So you came back, huh?
They think they can do better, but they all.
.
.
.
.
.come crawling back to Estelle.
What are you talking about?
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.
Really?
Oh, well, no harm no foul.
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.
-Why?
-Well, I think.
.
.
.
.
.
someone out there.
.
.
.
.
.
may have been bad-mouthing you all over town.
The bastard!
So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before.
And then I passed out.
.
.
.
.
.
and I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.
No way.
If I go to the doctor, it'll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Why'd I have to start working out again?
Damn you, 1 5s!
The lecture doesn't end for 1 5 minutes.
-We can sneak in and watch.
-Good.
Oh, hey, look!
There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.
I was a Kappa.
Hey, sisters!
Wow, we really are bitches.
Right.
So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory.
.
.
.
.
.
he made a startling discovery.
What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
Imagine his consternation when-- Oh, bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, I was nervous.
You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.
I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.
I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you, please.
.
.
?
Dr. Geller?
Kurt Rathman.
I'm a paleontology professor here.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Geller.
Right.
Will you excuse us for one moment?
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?
Top of the morning to you, laddies!
Would you just please stop?
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
Sit down!
Will you go to the hospital?
Hernia operations cost.
.
.
.
.
.
a lot probably, okay?
Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.
That means it's healing.
Look, I'll loan you the money.
Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing.
.
.
.
.
.
pushed back in.
Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you back.
I don't want that hanging over my head.
Besides, when my insurance kicks in.
.
.
.
.
.
I can get all the free operations I want.
I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
What's going on?
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach.
.
.
.
.
.
it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey, maybe you'll die!
Chandler, I'm scared.
No, we can go together.
Just don't wait too long, because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.
But I don't want to die.
It'll be fun.
We'll come back and haunt these guys!
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!
Give me them!
Just wanna each take one?
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.
Look, I really need some help, okay?
Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
What do I do?
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.
People will think you're adjusting to life in America.
Come on.
No one will even notice.
They're probably not even listening to you.
They're not listening to me?
Of course they're listening to you.
Everybody listens to you.
Monica, do you think I should try this phasing-out thing?
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise.
.
.
.
.
.
for you.
Hold it.
I'm sorry.
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.
Oh, yeah.
Sure, no problem.
Just hold on one second.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise for you!
Oh, my God!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.
Pick up a bag today.
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.
The line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
Or I could just point to it.
Purina One.
Point to a bag today.
I didn't get it, did l?
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm here to audition for "Man.
" You mean "Dying Man.
" -Do it one more time.
-Really?
Really?
Okay.
Hello, Ross?
This is Dr. McNeely from the Fake Accent University.
We'd like you to come onboard full-time!
Listen to this!
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.
Really?
How do you know?
My psychic is dead!
She must have read the cards wrong.
I'm sorry.
Better her than me.
Hey, let's bake cookies!
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Are you sure you can do this?
And thanks for coming with me.
And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that "never talking about it again"?
We're ready for you.
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.
Hi, Alex.
As you can see, my hands are not in my pants.
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line.
.
.
.
.
.
"Take good care of your mama, son," that's your cue to cry.
Got it?
All right, let's do this.
Scene five, take one.
And action!
Take good care of your mama, son.
Take good care of your mama, son.
Come on, son.
Your mama's good people.
Cut!
Alex, remember, you're supposed to cry.
Can you cry for us this time?
All right.
From the top.
Scene five, take two.
Take 36 is up.
Let's try this again.
You ready, Joe?
One thing, is it all right if I scream.
.
.
.
.
.
right up until you say, "Action"?
Sure.
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.
Cut!
I'm sorry.
Why don't you lift up your shirt?
Take a look at this, kiddo.
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not.
Can I take a message?
Yes, this is Russell, Ross ' divorce lawyer.
Since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's giving the marriage a try.
Ross got married again?
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.
Phasing it out.
"So without retesting their results in the laboratory.
.
.
.
.
.
the team would never have identified.
.
.
.
.
.
the initial errors in their carbon dating.
.
.
.
.
.
analysis.
" Were there any questions at this point?
What's happening to your accent?
Come again?
What's this nonsense?
All right.
I'm not English.
I'm from Long lsland.
I was really nervous, and the accent.
.
.
.
.
.
just came out.
I'm sorry.
So if we could just get back to the lecture.
Were there any questions?
About paleontology?
I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up.
But what you guys think of me is important.
.
.
.
.
.
because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression-- Ross!
Are you crazy?
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I could just kill you!
Well, hello, Rachel!
You've really done this before?
You just take a big, big swing, okay?
Now, don't hold back.
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married!
Look, I was going to tell you.
When?
After the birth of our first secret child?
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married!
-You're kidding?
-Oh, my God!
It wasn't my best decision, but I couldn't face another failed marriage.
At what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on.
If you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.
Maybe it's best not to think about it.
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie.
You have a sickness!
For my own peace of mind, are you married to any more of us?
The One With Joey's Porshe Gelula/SDI Someone left their keys.
To a Porsche.
-Are these yours?
-Yeah.
That's what I drive.
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.
Did anybody lose their keys?
Put them in the lost and found.
There's a lost and found?
My shoe!
You left a shoe here?
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.
I'll go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
When he comes back for his keys, I'll give him your shoe.
Great.
Thanks.
Oh, good.
You guys are here.
Listen.
How would you like to spend tomorrow taking care of three cute puppies?
My, God!
What a fun day!
Sounds great!
Yeah, all right.
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.
By the way, they're not actually puppies.
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
See you.
What?
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice.
.
.
.
.
.
asked me to babysit them.
I'm nervous.
I've never done that.
Don't worry.
We'll do it.
I'm gonna pass, because I was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
Come on, Chandler.
It'll give us great practice for when.
.
.
.
.
.
people with babies come to visit.
Nice car.
It's not mine.
-I love your car.
-Yeah.
It's mine.
-I bet it's fast.
-Me too.
Yeah.
And comfortable.
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.
It's got them!
So I still have boxes here.
I still have boxes at Ross' .
And I have nowhere to live.
I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me?
Denise is leaving town for a while.
I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe I could be your roommate, Pheebs.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well, there's an idea!
That would be great!
-How long is Denise gone for?
-She said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th.
Maybe she's Santa Claus.
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2.
.
.
.
.
.
and I picked up all the forms.
I'll take care of it.
Sure, if you say you'll take care of it, I have no reason to doubt you.
Give me those forms.
I'm gonna do this my way, and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.
-Okay, Rach, but-- -You're peeping!
Ross, I just got-- -Why did you do this?
-I told you-- I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages.
" If you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.
Oh, I am so mad, Ross!
I don't think I've ever been this angry!
What about when I said we were on a break?
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm okay.
Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?
No.
You sound like me.
It's going great.
Look at Chandler with Little Baby Girl Chandler.
Little Baby Girl Chandler.
Where have I heard that before?
Oh, Coach Rubin.
Pheebs, when you're done over there, we've got a situation over here too.
No.
We are all responsible for our own babies.
That's where you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.
We should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Things'll go smoother if we each have a zone.
Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.
Mon, be in charge of diapering.
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands.
.
.
.
Sounds great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.
This is so great.
This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah?
Well, this is not what I ordered.
Hey, guys.
Hey, babies.
I'm having the best morning.
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.
Shocking, since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get with that car.
People are friendly.
They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.
One guy advised me on my equity investments.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?
If people see me just standing there, they're gonna think I don't own it.
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?
Oh, yeah.
I got soap and sponges and rags.
.
.
.
.
.
and carnauba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car.
I know.
Once there was a dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
-And?
-And six others.
There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 1 30.
That's just in the city.
I get her up to 1 60 upstate.
Really?
You got a place upstate?
Sure.
-All right.
See you later.
-Okay.
Take it easy.
Hey.
That's my car.
Really?
Just give me five more minutes.
What are you doing?
I found the keys, and now I'm just polishing her up.
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I don't come to the city much.
I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some street theater.
.
.
.
.
.
but could I have my keys?
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll save your parking spot.
I'm not coming back.
-Why not?
-I live upstate.
Yeah, so did l. I don't know why I was so nervous.
.
.
.
.
.
and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.
Check it out!
When the babies wake up.
.
.
.
.
.
they can meet Krog!
That thing could put someone's eye out.
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.
They could swallow one of those little parts.
Also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass.
-What?
-Glass, sand, whatever.
Look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh, it's so cute.
I wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head.
I can still do that.
How are you still single?
I thought about it, and maybe you're right.
Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
-What made you change your mind?
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?
I was trying to prove that I was right.
And it turns out I was wrong.
.
.
.
.
.
and now it's lodged in my throat.
This whole time we were concentrating on the babies.
.
.
.
.
.
and no one was watching Chandler!
You are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes, Your Honor.
Here are our forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition.
.
.
.
.
.
you are seeking an annulment on the grounds.
.
.
.
.
.
that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
" Fine.
I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user.
" -What?
-Yes.
Heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
Well, you would know.
Now, it also says here that you.
.
.
.
.
.
"Iied about your sexual preference before marriage.
" Oh, come on.
Ross, please.
I found the magazines.
And, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage.
" Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem.
.
.
.
.
.
with my ability to consummate anything.
I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
If you were involved in a serious relationship, that creates a problem.
Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
Strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
Is there anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, yes.
We got married in Vegas.
And the names, I think.
Based on what I've heard, you certainly don't qualify for an annulment.
If you don't wanna be together, file for divorce.
That's great.
You happy?
Look what you did with your funny, funny form.
What?
Me?
What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
And what-- What are you typing that for?
She said we don't get the annulment.
Don't type that.
What-- Stop typing!
Stop typing!
"Stop typing, stop typing!
" Okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?
Get out of my chambers.
Lady, here's the deal.
I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one!
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.
That Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
They'll think you own one because of the clothes?
Of course.
Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there.
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
You know you don't actually have one.
What are you doing?
I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.
We'll go to the emergency room.
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.
We're playing a zone.
They'll triple-team me!
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna.
.
.
.
.
.
naturally pass through his system in seven years.
-I think that's gum.
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.
This really hurts.
Let's go.
But no!
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
No!
What would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
-That was totally your fault.
-My fault?
You threatened the judge.
You ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi.
How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment.
Now we gotta get a divorce!
Did a Porsche throw up on you?
It's "Porsche-a" !
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
You guys feel safe, right?
I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do!
" Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
I broke it.
All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.
Okay.
Good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where's Leslie?
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie?
Where are you, Leslie?
Now would be a good time for your first words.
Well, look at you!
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
Well, it'll dry.
You sit with your brother and sister now.
.
.
.
.
.
who aren't there.
How do you feel?
Let's just say, Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again.
.
.
.
.
.
in 1 2 to 1 4 hours.
I totally took care of the babies all by myself.
I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh, my God!
I know.
The babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what happened here?
I did it.
I took care of the babies all by myself.
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies.
You're right.
I shouldn't freak out.
This is what it'll be like when we have babies.
When's that?
Phoebe, look at this mess!
Honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers.
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.
Little X's.
Great!
That makes up for everything.
You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
Name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.
How about you flew to London to stop my wedding?
You told me you loved me after I was married.
Wait, that was different.
I did those things because I was in love with you.
Right.
You're right.
That's very different.
So let's just sign the papers.
What?
Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign, please?
Congratulations.
Okay, wait, Ross.
Wait a minute.
I kind of have a little confession.
What?
Well, you know, this whole marriage thing.
Kind of my idea.
Excuse me?
Remember how we were too drunk to remember anything when we were married?
I didn't really wanna say anything, but it just kept coming back to me.
We were in the casino, and you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.
So, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then.
.
.
.
.
.
to eat a lot of grapes.
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
So then if you think about it.
.
.
.
.
.
this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it, though.
I gotta say.
.
.
.
.
.
I know I divorce a lot of women.
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
I know.
I always thought if we got married, that'd be the one that stuck.
And it wouldn't be a secret.
.
.
.
.
.
and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I even treat?
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard.
I should get these to my lawyer's office.
Thanks for taking care of all this.
No problem.
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
-Totally.
Careful around my Porsche!
Hi, Joey.
Hey.
How you doing?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there.
I'd show you, but I just tucked her in.
She's sleeping.
Would you like to go for a drink?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I'm moving out, so you're in charge of paying the rent.
-When's it due?
-On the first.
And that's every month?
No, just the months you want to live here.
Okay, here's the phone bill.
Oh, my God!
That's our phone number.
I know I kind of sprung this me-moving-out-on-you thing.
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!
Joey Tribbiani does not take charity.
.
.
.
.
.
anymore.
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.
Thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.
I can take care of myself.
What's next?
Come on.
Here's the electric bill.
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.
So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?
The One On The Last Night Gelula/SDI Will Joey have to give up the apartment?
I offered him money, but he wouldn't take it.
How much does he need?
$1 500 would cover him for a few months.
.
.
.
.
.
but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.
Why don't you hire him as an actor?
You could have him dress up and put on skits whenever you want.
Well, that would help the pride thing.
Wow, you look great!
Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Any plans for tonight?
Instead of being sad on my last night with Rachel.
.
.
.
.
.
we're going out to celebrate Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say!
I'd never tell you it wasn't your birthday.
You guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.
I don't know, Ross.
Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
-Pheebs-- -You're not dressed yet?
We're supposed to start having fun in 1 5 minutes!
And clearly, not a minute sooner.
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.
I wanted to ask Phoebe what I should wear.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.
Oh, my God!
Monica's just gonna kill you.
I know.
What you're wearing is fine for that.
You're not packed!
You're not packed even a little bit!
Surprise!
Don't get mad, because this is what happened.
I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing"?
I am lousy at packing, right?
But you love packing!
So as a gift to you on our last night.
.
.
.
I'll be coordinator!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?
I have plans.
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift.
Tell the guys they have to help out.
My God, thank you!
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!
Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves!
The movers will be here in 1 1 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler-- I have plans with Joey.
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.
Fine.
Now, Ross-- -I can't do it.
-Why not?
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?
He's at a dinner party.
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.
Of course he is.
What?
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right.
Sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is.
Our last pizzas together as roommates.
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.
Well, that's okay.
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?
Our last dinner together.
Me, bringing the food of my ancestors.
.
.
.
.
.
you, the food of yours!
I had an idea for what to do on our last night.
What do you say we play a little foosball for money?
Are you crazy?
You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season.
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.
What do you say to $50?
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.
The big game.
Italy versus.
.
.
.
.
.
China, apparently.
Look, it's the Rollerblades.
Oh, God!
You remember when we got these?
I guess you weren't there.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.
Come on.
Hey, remember the time.
.
.
.
You don't remember?
Sorry, Pheebs.
I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know?
Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other.
.
.
.
.
.
you should think of the things you're not gonna miss.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
She's perfect.
I have one.
Okay, you can go first.
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact.
.
.
.
.
.
that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?
You know, does Rachel move the phone pen?
Sometimes.
Always, actually.
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen.
I never get my messages.
You get your messages.
It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand.
.
.
.
.
.
after you've fallen asleep on the couch.
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?
Or your mom?
Or Chandler?
Or your mom?
It worked!
No one's sad!
I win again!
That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me!
Man!
Five hundred dollars.
That is a lot of electricity, huh?
I gotta buy some food.
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death.
.
.
.
.
.
one goal, $1 000.
-You serious?
-Yes!
Get ready to owe me.
Here we go.
Ready?
No.
.
.
.
.
.
one can beat me!
That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!
Your brother.
Score!
What's up?
I'm here with Ben.
Thought we'd say hi.
Put him on.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.
He's smiling, though.
Okay, talk to you later.
I think it was better when you guys were sad.
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.
I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day, even if people are on it!
" "Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?
I'd better wash it and shrink it!
" "I'm Monica.
I never get messages from interesting people.
" I call her.
"Oh, my God!
I love Ross.
I hate Ross.
I love Ross.
I hate Ross!
" "My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there!
" We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
It sucks, man.
Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table.
.
.
.
.
.
and $500.
There are other ways to win back your money.
How about blackjack?
Not my game.
You know what?
We can play a new game.
-It's fun!
-What's it called?
Cups.
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you.
It's easy and fun.
-All right.
-Here you go.
I have two queens.
What do you have?
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win!
Fifty dollars!
-Really?
-Let's play again.
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.
You're kidding, right?
-No.
Why?
-That's a full cup!
Damn, I am good at Cups!
I'm not talking to her.
You have to take the first step.
.
.
.
.
.
because she's the one who's leaving.
It's harder for her.
Maybe you're right.
But she made fun of my phone pen!
I know.
I took it hard too.
I feel bad about what happened-- -What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left.
You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler!
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too!
What else you got?
How about: You're moving!
This is ridiculous.
We should be packing you!
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great.
Monica's moving.
I am not!
Really?
How come all your stuff is in this box?
Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here!
You guys?
Stop!
I know you're acting mad because it'll make it easier to leave.
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!
I'm just mad.
Then keep running.
You win!
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats.
.
.
.
.
.
a three and a six.
That, my friend, is "D Cup.
" How much have you won so far?
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?
Double it.
In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
I didn't make up the rules.
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card.
That one card could be worth $1 00, which brings your total to $1 500.
Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the-- No way!
This is the last box of your clothes.
I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking"?
I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.
You're so mean to each other.
I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel.
I still like you.
That's fine because I'm not moving.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.
I said some bad stuff.
.
.
.
.
.
but Rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate.
Like what, Monica?
She has 1 47,000 pair of boots?
Good start, Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!
She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like.
What else?
When I take a shower.
.
.
.
.
.
she leaves me notes on the mirror.
I do.
I do do that.
That's nice.
I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch.
.
.
.
.
.
she covers me with a blanket.
Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her I was gonna move in with Chandler.
.
.
.
.
.
she was really supportive.
You were so great.
You made it so easy.
And now you have to leave.
And I have to live with a boy!
It's gonna be fine.
Now I can't wait to live with you!
You know what we should do?
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!
I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?
Kinda.
Oh, my God!
How's the packing going?
Ben?
He's fine.
He's right-- Oh, my God!
Get your head out of your shirt there, son!
Yeah, it's a pumpkin.
I'll come pack.
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack.
.
.
.
.
.
took a little break.
I lost $1 500 to him in Cups!
How did you lose at Cups?
The same way you lost!
I started out with the king and the queen.
Bam!
Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom!
Ross gets a 4 and 5.
Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup.
.
.
.
.
.
the sitting-down bonus.
I didn't even get half a cup!
Nothing!
Oh, man!
He never played before either.
I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups!
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.
No more!
I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.
In fact, look.
I wanna give you something.
Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money.
I want you to have the big, white dog.
.
.
.
.
.
as a thank-you for being such a great roommate.
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.
It's "him.
" Not "it.
" What if I bought it from you?
Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.
Say $1 500?
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
Over there with the bills!
You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.
We had a nice last night together.
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.
Now you start with the charity thing again!
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay.
You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself.
I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.
The only thing I'm gonna miss.
.
.
.
.
.
is you.
And now the dog.
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I have your key.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Bye, house.
-She really left.
-I know.
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.
What kind of idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game.
I made it up.
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!
If you wanna try to make some of it back.
.
.
.
.
.
I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.
I am very good at Cups.
I assume the saucer card came up when you played last?
Let's see if it comes up this time.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Ready?
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please.
.
.
-.
.
.
Ieave-- -Leave.
But I just said "Ieave.
" I know because you have all the good words.
What do I get?
I get "it's," "and.
" Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a.
" Forget it.
-That's silly.
-All right.
So let's switch.
No, I have all the good words.
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.
- Hi.
.
.
-.
.
.
everybody.
.
.
-.
.
.
it's.
.
.
-.
.
.
Rachel.
.
.
-.
.
.
and.
.
.
-.
.
.
Phoebe's.
Wait.
How did you do that?
What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?
It'll be fun!
We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!
Wait just one more second.
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message.
Thanks!
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!
The One Where Phoebe Runs Gelula/SDI I just finished this fascinating book.
By the year 2030, there'll be computers.
.
.
.
.
.
that can carry out the same amount of functions as a human brain.
So, theoretically, you could download.
.
.
.
.
.
your thoughts and memories into this computer.
.
.
.
.
.
and live forever as a machine.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!
And while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.
She's gonna be my new roommate!
And she's gonna live with me!
It's nice to meet you.
Janine.
.
.
?
Le Croix.
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.
So where are you from?
Australia.
I just moved here.
From the land down under?
I didn't know that either!
So what do you do?
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?
She's a dancer!
I think I'll go unpack.
Did you interview her before you asked her to move in?
Of course!
What did you ask her?
When can you move in?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable.
You like her too?
Look at all the boxes!
I cannot wait to ask her out.
Wait a minute.
You can't.
She's your roommate.
It'll be too complicated.
Yeah, don't do it.
I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her.
Think about it.
Remember when you broke up with Donna.
.
.
.
.
.
how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket?
Oh, God, yeah.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!
You're right!
I don't want that.
I can't date her.
You'd better watch the flirting too, because it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.
It's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
You're around me all the time, and you don't flirt.
A little sad about that, sweetie?
I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!
I'm telling you, when she runs.
.
.
.
.
.
she looks like Kermit the Frog.
.
.
.
.
.
and the Six Million Dollar Man.
Monica had such a crush on him.
She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album, "It's Not Easy Being Green"?
Oh, Mon.
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
Yeah.
And I know she'll want to run again.
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me.
I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Why?
Why would you do that?
I don't know.
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.
Ankle.
We'll see.
Okay.
I am officially unpacked.
Thanks for helping me, man.
Joe?
Well, I guess Joey went home.
And look, there is still one box I have to unpack.
I got you!
Oh, my God.
.
.
.
.
.
you almost gave me a heart attack.
It was so hard not to laugh.
Hey, the place looks great.
Not bad, right?
Monica's working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless.
You know what else I'll do?
I'm gonna go downstairs and get her some flowers.
Who wouldn't want to live with me?
I don't.
No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer!
How's that going?
Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
So far.
But it's tough.
I've got this built-up flirting energy, and I don't know how to get rid of it.
How you doing?
Oh, man!
Sorry.
There's just more room out here.
No, you just reminded me that I have to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to be.
.
.
?
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
I didn't want you to touch me.
.
.
.
.
.
because I'm all sweaty from the workout.
I'm gonna hit the shower.
Oh, my God!
Sorry about that stuff hanging in there.
It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Oh, yeah, it's me.
I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, Phoebe, no.
I was.
.
.
.
I was actually just checking.
.
.
.
.
.
to see.
.
.
.
.
.
if I could run.
And I can!
Please, I'm not an idiot.
No, wait.
Phoebe?
Wow.
Couples who live together do start to look alike.
So, Mondler.
.
.
.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff?
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes.
I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
First of all, that attitude is not helping.
She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Hello?
Did you just meet Monica?
She'll recognize that I did a nice thing.
.
.
.
.
.
and appreciate it.
Actually, this will work out well.
Because when you move back with Joey.
.
.
.
.
.
Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
Oh, I see.
You're trying to freak me out.
Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
Believe me, I lived with her for Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.
I'll call her right now.
Phone's done.
-Hey, Mon.
How's it going?
-Terrible.
If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff.
I think I might kill someone tonight.
Come on, it can't be that bad.
The only thing getting me through.
.
.
.
.
.
is knowing I'll see you soon.
I might even try to get out of here early.
It sounds like they need you there.
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good!
Okay, bye!
She's gonna kill me.
The phone was facing the other way.
And that goes back up there.
We should start with the big stuff.
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.
I got it.
That doesn't look right.
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.
Then I can just walk over here and casually put my feet up on.
.
.
.
Okay, here's what we do.
We move the couch closer to the coffee table.
But then the back of the couch won't line up with the carpet.
Well, we'll just move the coffee table.
.
.
.
.
.
closer to the couch.
But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
But the coffee table doesn't match the table!
Look, what am I gonna do?
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame!
What the hell's going on over here?
Monica's gonna kill you!
I need your help.
I have to do something to repel this woman.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You guys repel women all the time!
Hey, I've been married three times.
No, I've seen it happen.
You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.
What's your secret?
We do not repel women, okay?
That is completely untrue.
Oh, yes, we do, my man.
Remember when we went to a dance.
.
.
.
.
.
and you walked up to that girl you liked and talked.
.
.
.
.
.
about the lrish potato famine?
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.
After everything he said, he'd go-- Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.
Girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
This is great.
What else?
They don't like you correcting their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.
Phoebe, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, okay?
I handled the situation horribly.
And I should not have lied to you.
So what should you have done?
I should have told you the truth.
Which is?
Well, the reason I didn't want to go running with you is.
.
.
.
.
.
because.
.
.
.
.
.
the way that you run is just a little.
.
.
.
-So?
-It's embarrassing.
People were looking at us like we were crazy.
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!
People you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still they are people.
.
.
.
.
.
with eyes.
I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss.
.
.
.
But okay.
I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
Okay.
You're uptight.
What?
I am not uptight.
I am not uptight, man.
That's okay.
I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid.
.
.
.
.
.
because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
Didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off.
.
.
.
.
.
Iike when you were running towards the swings or running away from Satan?
The neighbor's dog.
Is this in the right place?
Who cares?
I repel women.
You can't come in here!
Ross is naked!
I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I had to show Chandler something.
Naked?
I guess I have.
.
.
.
.
.
a "guy" problem.
Is it the same thing Chandler had?
We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later!
There's still some of Chandler's medicine in the bathroom.
-Bye.
-Bye!
Thank God.
Dude, what'd you have?
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.
We've got to get everything back into its original place.
The photo album!
There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
We just match everything to the pictures!
That's perfect!
That's brilliant!
What'd you have?
I've got some beer for you.
Don't you mean "for whom"?
Sure.
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?
Pizza?
It's not like I never had that before.
Is something wrong?
All right, all right.
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
You're hot.
I'm lovable.
Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
But we're roommates.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Imagine living in a supermarket.
.
.
.
.
.
and you'll understand.
Okay?
So the question is, what do we do?
There isn't anything to do.
I think you're really sweet.
But I'm not interested in you like that.
No, I mean.
.
.
.
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
I'm just, you know, I just.
.
.
.
.
.
don't feel that way about you.
I see what happened.
It's because I was trying to repel you.
Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What?
What?
Oh, dear God!
I'm so sorry.
You're right.
This feels great!
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second.
Then you're gone!
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!
Watch out for the horse.
Can I come in now?
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.
I don't see anything different.
.
.
.
.
.
other than the fact that the room got brighter when you came into it.
The end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre.
.
.
.
.
.
and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay, don't be mad, okay?
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you.
.
.
.
.
.
so I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything around, and then I forgot.
.
.
.
.
.
where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not.
My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing.
.
.
.
.
.
and I really appreciate it.
I have this thing where I want everything in the perfect place.
But I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Of course.
Oh, you're the best.
You come here to me.
Hold on, okay?
First things first.
Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
It said that by the year 2030.
.
.
.
.
.
there'll be computers carrying out the same number of functions.
.
.
.
.
.
as an actual human brain.
So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts.
.
.
.
.
.
and your memories into this computer-- And live forever as a machine.
Janine, do you know what we're doing right now?
You and l, we're interfacing.
I gotta go.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.
Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world.
.
.
.
.
.
for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor!
Come on in!
Is Janine around?
She's at dance class.
Can I check my room?
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.
Oh, my God!
It's like a guy never lived in here.
You gotta be careful.
This girl thing is dangerous.
It's spreading.
It is?
Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?
This is a "guy's" place.
Soon, you'll be soaking your fingers in stuff.
-You're right.
I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her.
Be a man!
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there, sweetums.
Totally different situation.
The One With Ross' Teeth Gelula/SDI Hey, guys.
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.
She's still depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Is this Hillary, your hot assistant chef, Hillary?
The one that stares at me when I come in?
The one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Still, I could tell.
She was into me.
Why don't you set us up?
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?
Rachel?
I'm making up flyers to try to get new massage clients.
Can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copier?
Sure, but they might think it's weird since I don't work there anymore.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Well, that's great!
Congratulations!
A year ago.
You've lasted all year!
Good for you.
You could still use the copier where I actually work.
But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.
Maybe it's a universal thing.
Maybe because you're all hanging around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday.
Let's head off to work.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
You will not believe this.
I was making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Oh, my God.
Did you talk to him?
A little.
He seems really nice.
-Good kisser.
-What?
What?
-You kissed him?
-Totally.
Phoebe, are you serious?
He came in and introduced himself.
The next thing I know, we're making out!
Phoebe, you do know he's married?
Phoebe.
I'm supposed to ask every guy I make out with if he's married?
No, yeah, I should.
Hey, Joey.
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.
Do you know this kid?
ls it a relative?
No.
I just thought it was cute.
That's what I was afraid of.
Okay.
.
.
.
I really want you to feel at home here, but.
.
.
.
.
.
some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
Like what?
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
We can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to make the place a little nicer.
But it's too much stuff.
You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
I just thought-- I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
But come on.
And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
Well, that's okay then.
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom.
.
.
.
.
.
and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.
It's clean.
It feels different.
It's dry.
All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
Also what is with these chips you bought?
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
Kim, hi.
I handed in that marketing report, and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
The spring line's really gonna be great this year, huh?
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Tell me everything.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
You know.
.
.
.
Oh, my God.
What happened to your teeth?
I whitened them.
Really?
What do you think?
I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old.
.
.
.
.
.
human teeth?
I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to.
-How much longer?
-A day.
Tonight is your date with Hillary.
I know.
That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?
She will be after tonight.
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything--?
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.
You guys are never gonna believe this.
.
.
.
.
.
but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
-What?
-Oh, my God!
She ran into him at my office, and they just made out.
The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because.
.
.
.
.
.
it's the best gossip she's heard all year.
I am proud of all my friends today.
I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
I'm so jealous!
Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.
Chandler, please.
Come on.
Look at him.
Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.
Here.
Who's the silver fox?
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?
Oh, wait.
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please.
" That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.
What?
Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack-- Oh, my God.
That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!
What?
I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
If she finds out that I lied to her, she'll hate me even more.
Phoebe!
Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him!
This will make them look less white.
Nope.
Colors that don't work are.
.
.
.
.
.
blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.
Maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh, great!
So all I need to do is get some new skin.
Thank you.
If we put just a little bit of makeup on you-- Whoa!
We're not 1 3 anymore.
This is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Won't she notice I have makeup on?
Half the guys out there have makeup on.
What?
Half the people-- I mean-- Just try it and see.
I am not putting on makeup.
Hello?
Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
No!
Demon!
Demon!
Our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
God forbid we throw out old underwear.
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
We've got to organize the wrapping paper.
I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
In fact, we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
This has been a girlie day.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I just feel like I need to be in a "guy" place.
.
.
.
.
.
do kind of a "man" thing.
You go over to Joey's and.
.
.
.
.
.
drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
When guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
I'm sorry.
We do.
I don't know why I said that.
Hey, Chandler.
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.
No, thanks, Josephine.
Ross, I was wondering if-- Oh, my God!
Where are all the men?
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order?
Okay, two things didn't happen.
Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren?
Well, it turns out that's not true.
It's not true?
That's interesting.
Because I checked.
Only one keycard was used to access the copier.
.
.
.
.
.
yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you.
You think I made out with him?
Listen to me.
.
.
.
.
.
sleeping with Ralph is not gonna get you my job.
I don't want your job.
I don't.
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.
I don't even know how to use my keycard.
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.
Yeah.
Nothing happened.
You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
After that, what could I do except become a chef?
Soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
You're a really great listener.
Most guys I go out with, they talk and talk.
It's like, "Shut your mouth.
" You know?
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?
Come on, I want to know.
Okay.
I'm from Long lsland.
I came to the city for college.
I have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time.
.
.
.
.
.
I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.
If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan.
.
.
.
.
.
your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Joey, that is such a great tip!
Monica, I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder.
.
.
.
.
.
out of a pine cone and some peanut butter.
I love birds.
What is the matter with you?
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!
You got dead flowers!
You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers!
This is not Joey!
Look, I am still Joey, okay?
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.
And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.
You're turning into a woman.
No, I'm not.
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.
Now I've upset you?
What did I say?
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.
Oh, my God!
I'm a woman!
So now she thinks that I made out with him to get her job.
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.
She doesn't think anyone would confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?
Did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today.
Just for a second.
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Sleep with Kenny.
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.
I've had a really good time tonight.
I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Me neither.
I've had a really good time too, you know.
Are you gonna eat that bread?
I just like the smell.
You make me laugh.
Would you like to move to the couch?
Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little?
How about all the way?
Okay.
Wow, cool poster.
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
So.
.
.
.
.
.
where were we?
Are those your teeth?
You can see them, huh?
Yes.
They're insanely white.
I did that for you.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light.
It's 1 999!
Oh, good.
Kim, hi.
Hi, Rachel.
I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.
Okay, look.
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
You were right.
Ralph and I were an item, but we're not anymore.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me.
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.
Even though you're a very, very.
.
.
.
.
.
very beautiful woman.
.
.
.
.
.
I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry.
" But he said, "And you will never get promoted.
.
.
.
.
.
especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog.
.
.
.
.
.
in the Ralph Lauren machine.
" You expect me to believe-- -Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.
Oh, my God.
He gave you the coldest look I've ever seen.
It's like he hates you!
Then it is true!
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.
Oh, honey, come here.
Oh, it'll be okay.
We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copy boy.
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter?
You upset?
We gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
I gotta be a man!
The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll just put it all in my room.
Good.
Great.
Thanks for being so understanding.
I didn't want to make a big deal out of this.
But you could put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
And maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Okay, great.
Bye.
Guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Sidney Poitier?
I miss Rachel.
My parents.
Great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.
If you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
Why can't I tell them we live together?
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?
Well, I was going to.
I really was.
But then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why not?
Wouldn't they be happy?
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, because.
.
.
.
.
.
mainly.
.
.
.
.
.
they don't like you.
-I'm sorry.
-What?
Why?
Why?
Maybe because you used to be aloof.
.
.
.
.
.
or that you're sarcastic or that you joke around.
.
.
.
.
.
or that you throw your clothes on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me or you don't like me?
I know I should have told them.
I shouldn't care what they think.
I'm sorry.
It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be charming.
I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.
Will that work?
I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't l?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.
The One Where Ross Got High Gelula/SDI Hey.
Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you.
Monica told me they don't.
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
Maybe it's because you're sarcastic or maybe it's because you-- If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess!
Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, huh?
Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my place.
Maybe I love you.
Hey, guys.
No, I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Yeah, why?
Me and my friends are doing Thanksgiving uptown.
I thought you might like to come.
For real?
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.
We'll just drink all day.
We go to yours!
We have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.
But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice.
.
.
.
.
.
because it helped me understand women.
Yeah, you should tell your friends that.
Okay.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Pheebs, check it out!
For my dessert.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm making a traditional English trifle.
Wow.
That sounds great!
And what are you making, Monica?
In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it.
.
.
.
.
.
and there's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
Nothing?
No, sweetie.
I trust you.
If I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You won't mess it up.
I love that.
You really have faith in me.
Thank you.
Question: How do you know when the butter is done?
It's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
-The food smells great, Mon.
-And the place looks so nice.
-Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
-Happy Thanksgiving!
-Well, this has been great.
-See you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going?
We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Who else is going to be there?
Her friends.
Her dancer friends?
Yes!
All right?
All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there.
.
.
.
.
.
and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go!
Dude, we were good.
You're not going.
You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls.
.
.
.
.
.
is not very Thanksgiving-y.
Oh, but it is.
It's like the first Thanksgiving when the lndians and Pilgrims sat down.
Then the lndians taught the Pilgrims.
.
.
.
.
.
what it meant to be hot in the New World!
-Hello, everybody!
-Hi!
Hi, Dad.
Mom.
Look!
Look who it is!
It's Chandler!
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.
Whoa, it snowing out there?
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
You should do this for a living.
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.
Chandler was laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Rach, I just remembered.
I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?
I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building.
.
.
.
.
.
and he was so brave and so strong.
And it's making me look at him totally differently.
He used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad.
" Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk.
" I don't know.
To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller.
.
.
.
.
.
walks in while you're changing.
" You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.
Ross sure is a great guy.
I've always felt that how a man turns out.
.
.
.
.
.
is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?
He's a headliner of a. .
.
.
.
.
gay burlesque show.
You're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?
There's drunken dancers a-waiting!
Look at it.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah.
What is it?
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then jam.
.
.
.
.
.
then custard, which I made from scratch.
.
.
.
.
.
then raspberries, more ladyfingers.
.
.
.
.
.
then beef sautÃ©ed with peas and onions.
.
.
.
.
.
then a little bit more custard.
.
.
.
.
.
then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.
What was the one right before bananas?
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.
But then I thought, "Well, there's minced meat pie.
" That's an English dessert.
These people just put strange things in their food.
Can I borrow rum from your place?
Yeah, sure.
While I'm gone, don't you sneak a taste.
Beef in a dessert?
No, no, no.
There is no way.
I know.
And only one layer of jam?
What is up with that?
Oh, my God.
The pages are stuck together.
Chandler!
Oh, my God.
She made half an English trifle and.
.
.
.
.
.
half a shepherd's pie!
Man, now she's gonna start all over.
We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah.
It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story.
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
Joey.
God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.
Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
No.
Still not hot enough!
Rachel.
Okay, look at him.
Look at those strong hands.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Thank you.
I just bought it.
Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and.
.
.
.
I don't mean tight.
It's not tight.
Not that I was looking at.
.
.
.
What's the matter with him?
I think he's stoned again.
What?
I need to talk to you.
I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Why?
Okay, remember we were young.
Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom.
.
.
.
.
.
and my parents walked in and smelled it.
.
.
.
.
.
so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
Yours was the first name that popped into my head.
I didn't think it'd matter.
How could it not matter?
How was I to know we'd be friends after college.
.
.
.
.
.
and you'd be living with my sister?
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know.
I was all high.
Mom and Dad sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me!
I can't believe you!
We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, so fix this.
Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.
Now, who should I say it was?
You!
It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.
All right.
Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.
And if you're gonna put your feet up-- Leave him alone!
Will you hurry up?
Did you not hear me when I told you that Janine's friends are dancers?
And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
No, I did.
But tell me again because it's so romantic.
You're whipping so slow.
Do it faster!
I don't want to make any mistakes!
If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like: "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle"?
Just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it.
Oh, I am.
-If you don't tell them, then I will.
-Okay.
Fine.
Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
Can it wait?
I have to tell my parents something.
No, it can't?
Okay.
We have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?
What is with everybody?
It's Thanksgiving, not.
.
.
.
.
.
Truth Day!
Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing.
.
.
.
.
.
they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?
We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.
That way, no one makes fun of her.
.
.
.
.
.
and we still get to go to sweet potato pie.
Dude, they're not objects.
Just kidding.
I'll talk to them.
You distract her.
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Okay.
What's up, Ross?
So.
.
.
.
Thanksgiving.
The holiday season is upon us.
And.
.
.
.
.
.
you look nice today.
-Oh, no.
No, Ross, don't do this.
-What?
I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
I thought this might happen today.
I know the holidays can be rough.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's probably hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
No, I live with Phoebe.
I mean, you're alone-alone.
And it's just not the time for us.
I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
And if anyone needs help pretending to like it.
.
.
.
.
.
I learned some things in acting class.
Try rubbing your stomach.
Or saying "Mmm.
" Smiling.
I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already!
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You don't get any dessert.
Really?
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
So, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
-It sure is.
-Wow.
So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
-Beef.
-I can't have any.
I don't eat meat.
Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Wait, you only got whipped cream.
You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
You dropped a pea.
Well?
It's good.
Really?
How good?
It's so good that I feel selfish.
.
.
.
.
.
about being the only one who's eating it.
I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Especially Ross.
This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I've gotta call my friend.
.
.
.
.
.
and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
I'll help dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom.
.
.
.
.
.
so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
What was that all about?
Does it not taste good?
-Let me try it.
-No, no!
All gone!
So good.
Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet.
I like it!
Are you kidding?
What's not to like?
Custard, good.
Jam, good.
Meat, good.
So a bird just grabbed it.
.
.
.
.
.
and then tried to fly away with it.
.
.
.
.
.
and then just dropped it on the street?
If it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it.
.
.
.
.
.
he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here.
I was taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream.
-Do I want to hear this?
-I don't know, let's see.
I dreamt we were getting married.
.
.
.
.
.
and he left because he had to go fight a fire.
So I went to a nightclub and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!
But then Jacques Cousteau came.
.
.
.
.
.
and he kicked his ass for betraying me.
So cool!
Then he took me diving and introduced me to his sea horse.
.
.
.
.
.
who was coming on to me.
Please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.
But now, nothing.
Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.
Ross?
Let's go.
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad.
.
.
.
.
.
I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
That's it.
You've had your chance.
Mom, Dad.
Ross smoked pot in college.
You are such a tattletale!
Mom, Dad.
.
.
.
.
.
you remember that time you walked in my room.
.
.
.
.
.
and smelled marijuana?
Yes.
I told you it was Chandler.
.
.
.
.
.
who was smoking the pot but.
.
.
.
.
.
it was me.
I'm sorry.
It was you?
Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired?
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing.
Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
And got divorced!
Again!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
I want to go!
That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds.
All right.
Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
It did not taste good.
Phoebe, I'm sorry.
.
.
.
.
.
but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact.
.
.
.
.
.
that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
Ross.
Drugs?
Divorced again?
What happened, son?
I got tricked into all those things.
Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years.
.
.
.
.
.
stuck by him during the drug problems.
.
.
.
.
.
and now you've taken on Monica as well.
Well, I don't know what to say.
You're a wonderful human being.
-Thank you!
-No.
Thank you!
Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
I'll talk to them.
You guys, it was bananas.
.
.
.
.
.
cream and beef!
I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.
No, I ate that.
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and got yours too.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Why is everybody using these tiny little lights nowadays?
I remember when people used big ones.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Wow.
Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?
Did someone get her drunk again, or.
.
.
?
Having a perfect tree is not what Christmas is about.
It's about being with loved ones.
That is nice.
And we're done.
Ta-da!
It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.
See, now it feels like Christmas.
The One With the Routine Gelula/SDI And that's the story of the dreidel.
Some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians.
.
.
.
.
.
who'd bring palm branches into huts on the shortest day of the year.
.
.
.
.
.
symbolizing life's triumph over death.
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.
So, around the same time that you started telling this story.
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.
What's up?
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.
Everywhere I look she's like.
.
.
.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much.
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.
I know.
And she's so sweet.
I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine.
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special for New Year's Eve.
It's called some sort of Dickin ' Rockin ' Dicky Eve.
Hold it.
Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh, my God, we love that show!
Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember.
You're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?
I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?
I would love to spend New Year's with you.
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why-- Well, how it works is.
.
.
.
.
.
the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live.
But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.
Not a lot of people know that.
Do you guys want to come too?
-Are you serious?
-We are there!
What are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her.
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.
I gotta run.
I'll catch you later.
Bye, Janine.
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I don't think so.
She invited him to the biggest party of the millennium.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross.
I'm sorry, I don't think that that was a romantic thing.
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.
It's a New Year's Eve party.
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.
If she says, "What are you doing"?
I can say, "It wasn't me, it was New Year's.
" That's better than Ross kissing me in high school.
.
.
.
.
.
and saying that he did it because he needed Chap Stick.
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Okay, I've been on sets before.
.
.
.
.
.
so let me give you some advice.
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.
Important thing to remember: Stay cool.
-Got it.
-Okay.
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!
Everyone!
Gather up!
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!
The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance.
.
.
.
.
.
we'll tape it.
Don't look at the camera.
Questions?
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?
Yeah.
Now, you guys dance over there.
.
.
.
.
.
you guys, over there.
I want you two here.
And everyone else, spread out.
So when is it gonna air?
You look in the kitchen, I got the closet.
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.
Yeah.
Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.
We're looking for our presents from Monica.
That's terrible.
No, we do it every year.
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily.
.
.
minx.
We'll search here for an hour.
.
.
.
.
.
and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay?
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.
You don't have to.
And you can't, because I live here too.
Well, then you should look with us.
Why?
Aren't you worried about what to get Monica?
No, I have a great idea for her present.
Oh, that's it?
A great idea?
Oh, yeah?
What if she gets you a great present.
.
.
.
.
.
two mediums and lots of little ones.
.
.
.
.
.
and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.
Why would you do that to her?
Why?
Why?
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!
We have a live one!
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.
Who's it for?
"Dear Losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?
P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
" Uh-oh.
She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
You said you'd go across the hall and look.
Do you do that every year?
Yeah.
You don't go into the back of my closet.
.
.
.
.
.
and look under my gym bag or anything?
-No.
Never do that.
-No.
That's where Joey gave me stuff to store that I've never seen.
Okay, that did not just happen.
Here comes a camera.
Right.
No biggie.
Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
We have to get up on one of those platforms.
They've been taping them all day.
Right.
What'd you guys do to get up on there?
We learned how to dance.
When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?
You'd be better if you loosened your hips.
-What do you mean?
-Like this.
That's it.
Feel the rhythm.
That's better.
You're dancing with her.
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.
I don't see it.
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!
Hey, buddy.
Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, you think so?
I don't.
I couldn't find anything-- Hey, wait!
Yeah, we found them.
They were in the guest room closet.
You have nothing to worry about because they're crap.
Those are mine.
I got those for you.
Oh.
Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
Chandler, what is this very weird metal A-Z thing?
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.
Oh.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az.
" Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet.
Yes, okay.
By the way, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved.
.
.
.
.
.
you still keep storing that stuff for Joey.
Hey, dancing girl?
Can I go to the bathroom?
Here we go.
Yeah.
Looking good, Gellers!
We know!
That snippy guy's the one who decides who gets on the platform.
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.
Okay, everybody, hold!
Next on the platforms are.
.
.
.
You two!
And.
.
.
.
-You two!
-Cool!
Excuse me?
Sir?
Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Would it?
Hey, Tall Guy!
I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh?
To think I almost brought my wife to this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Look, I came with that girl, okay?
I plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown.
I'm trying to win her over.
I-- I don't think so.
You can dance with my partner.
She's real mellow.
Look, you dating this girl you came with?
I was hoping after tonight that maybe.
.
.
.
No.
No.
She's fair game if you ask me.
Sorry, buddy.
All right.
Hey.
Fair is fair.
When you're right, you're right.
What can I say?
Are you in second grade?
Hey, man.
You're the one who wet his pants.
Man, this sucks.
If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous.
.
.
.
.
.
then who's gonna be the losers then?
I know what'll get us up on a platform.
What?
The routine!
We haven't done the routine since middle school.
When the snippy guy sees the routine.
.
.
.
.
.
he'll want to build us our own platform.
Was it that good?
We got honorable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it.
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Five, six, seven, eight!
So, do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next?
You get up there and do that again, exactly like that.
Get this.
Dick will want it for the Bloopers show.
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!
When we start, it'll be the countdown.
.
.
.
.
.
so I want to see everybody's excitement!
Hey, guy!
You got three seconds to get away.
What's going on here?
Take a look at the guy's pants!
You told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went overboard?
What's the matter with you?
Go!
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
Can you believe this?
We're on the platform for the millennial moment!
I know!
You haven't been practicing the routine, have you?
No.
Me too!
When the music starts.
.
.
.
.
.
I was thinking about maybe going into the robot.
Ross?
We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.
Seven.
Okay, it all comes down to this.
Whatever happens, happens.
Destiny.
--three, two, one!
-Cut!
-No!
--year!
Happy No Year!
Now we go to the live shot of Times Square.
That's a wrap!
Hey, look who I found.
Oh, hi, guys!
Birds have a very good sense of direction.
I thought maybe they could help us find the presents.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes.
Any ideas?
Didn't think so.
Come on, show us where the presents are.
The duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.
I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
How about my "az"?
Hey.
This is hollow.
What?
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!
What?
All right, no, we could look at them.
This one's for me!
This one's for Chandler.
Here.
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!
-Wait a minute.
We can't do this.
-Why?
I don't want to know what Monica got me.
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
And you guys are gonna ruin that.
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything, okay?
I want to see the look on her face when I give her my present.
I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine.
So, please, please, can we just.
.
.
?
Can we put them back?
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.
Hey, guys.
You found the presents?
You let them find the presents?
Great.
Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see.
That look is priceless.
Home sweet home, huh?
Nice to get back to reality.
Plus, we know how the New Year's gonna go off.
I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know?
Anyway, good night.
-Joey?
-Yeah?
Three.
.
.
.
.
.
two, one.
Happy New Year.
What was that for?
Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss.
.
.
.
.
.
I was really, really disappointed, and I just.
.
.
.
I just really wanted to kiss you.
Really?
In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too.
In the moment.
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.
So do you want to kiss again?
Sure.
New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
Three, two.
.
.
.
You don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Oh.
Okay.
Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium.
.
.
.
.
.
and the guy yells "cut!
" So you guys are telling me that you actually did.
.
.
.
.
.
the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah!
But of course we had to update it a little bit.
Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
There's no way you could've done the end.
.
.
.
.
.
the way you guys did it back then.
What?
We could do it.
I don't know.
You were a lot bigger-- I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay?
Come on, let's go!
Come on.
One, two, three, four.
.
.
.
.
.
five, six, seven, eight.
I can't do it!
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Listen.
.
.
.
You think I have a chance with Janine?
We've been through this.
Don't do this to yourself.
She made it clear it isn't going to happen.
All right, then.
I guess I shouldn't get too excited.
.
.
.
.
.
that I just kissed her!
-Are you serious?
-That's great!
Yeah, well, we'll see.
You kissed her?
We kissed it up real nice.
So you kissed.
Then what happened?
I came over here to tell you guys.
So she's waiting over there for you?
Yeah.
The One With The Apothecary Table Gelula/SDI -I gotta go.
-Okay.
I'm gonna be late for dance class.
Okay.
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.
But can you just.
.
.
.
.
.
just leave your lips?
Have you kissed her yet?
It's awesome!
I could do it forever.
You know what?
She kisses better than my mom cooks.
I'm so glad you said "cooks.
" Rachel, you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.
We still get your bills and stuff.
Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man.
I'm your mailman.
Monica, look.
Here is that table that I ordered.
-You got it from Pottery Barn?
-Yeah.
It's an apothecary table.
Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
"A pharmacist.
" Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too.
They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.
You took off your pants and got under the sheets.
I was tired.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?
She hates mass-produced stuff.
She thinks her furniture should have a story behind it.
This has a story behind it.
They had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey!
I made that for her.
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.
I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.
I'll tell her that it's an antique.
She doesn't have to know where it came from.
I love these little drawers.
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.
Just like the apothecary tables of yore.
So the farmer says: "That's not a cow, and you're not milking.
" I'm so glad you're together.
We wanted a couple to go out with and now we have one.
We're a couple of couples.
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!
And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one.
Thanks again, man.
If you come over tomorrow, I'll make pasta.
-That'd be great!
-Okay.
But at least let us bring the wine.
-You don't have to.
-I insist.
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.
Can't wait.
How are we going to get out of that one?
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
What's wrong with them?
They're just a little.
.
.
.
.
.
blah!
Blah?
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just.
.
.
.
She's very loud for such a small person.
They're my best friends.
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.
Of course we can still hang out with them.
Just not two nights in a row.
-Okay?
-I guess.
Thank you.
I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
What a great table!
Where did you get it?
Guess.
A flea market?
I knew you would get it on the first guess.
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.
You can just imagine that this is where.
.
.
.
.
.
they kept all their stuff to make potions.
You can almost smell the opium.
Almost.
How much was it?
Just only 500 bucks.
I thought you meant how much was it.
.
.
.
.
.
when it was new, back then.
It was at a flea market, so it was like a dollar.
-A dollar?
-And fifty?
So it was like one and fifty dollars.
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
It's from yore.
Like, the "days of yore," you know?
Yes, I do.
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.
I bet it has a great story too.
Did they tell you where it's from or.
.
.
.
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.
White Plains.
It sounds like such a magical place.
-I'm here.
-Hi!
Oh, my God!
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!
It's my new apothecary table!
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.
Why not?
She'll love it.
It's the real thing.
I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know.
I bought the same one.
And if she sees your table, she'll know I lied.
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?
She says it's all mass-produced.
.
.
.
.
.
nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.
Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.
I forgot they made sheets!
I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.
It's not like she hates you.
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
You know what I think?
She's just weird.
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.
She's not weird.
She likes her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!
Let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.
At a flea market.
You buy your sheets at a flea market?
Come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.
Here is the wine to bring over tonight.
You were also gonna buy Monica flowers.
.
.
.
.
.
but you couldn't because you paid for dinner last night.
Thanks.
But it's just gonna be me tonight.
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.
High fever, nose problem.
It's.
.
.
.
.
.
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
Monica!
Chandler!
I'm sorry about tonight.
I don't know if Joey told you.
.
.
.
.
.
but I couldn't get out of going to this play.
Have a great time, huh?
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Oh, no, she really is sick.
Then why is she going to a play?
Well, you know, "Starve a fever.
.
.
.
.
.
go to a play for a cold.
" Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
She didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.
I'm so sorry.
Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?
Because she thinks that you are "blah.
" And that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?
!
What?
So she just pretended to have a good time?
She was lying to our faces?
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not "blah.
" I am a hoot!
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.
I'm sure she said it.
.
.
.
.
.
because she was nervous 'cause you're my best friends.
And it was our first date.
Plus, she's really sick.
You said you made that up!
But isn't the "sick" thing better than the "play" thing?
They're both good.
I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again.
" Come on, please just give her another chance.
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.
I do not like that woman!
I can hear you!
I am loud!
Can you please not put your feet up on my new.
.
.
.
.
.
old sheet.
Oh, sure.
My apothecary table!
-What?
-No!
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?
Oh, my God!
Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
If they've ripped off our table.
.
.
.
.
.
ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars.
This doesn't even smell like opium.
It smells like wine, which you spilled.
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.
Ross, calm down.
I'll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.
Would you like some orange juice?
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!
What are you guys doing?
Nothing.
We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.
Come on, you said you were gonna try.
I came over to invite you to a movie with me and Janine.
-What do you say?
-I'd like to.
.
.
.
.
.
but I'm not sure if we have the time.
Very funny.
I don't know what to do.
I really want you to get along.
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.
-We owe you?
-That's right.
I helped you out in the start of your relationship.
I helped you sneak around for six months.
I looked like an idiot.
And I was humiliated.
And I only made $200.
We didn't give you any money.
You don't think I know that?
I can't decide if it goes better by the new chair.
.

the Sahara desk.
.
.
.
.
.
or the Parker console table.
I didn't know there was a Pottery Barn up here.
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?
Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.
Look at that!
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.
Oh, Ross?
Be careful.
That is very old.
Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find!
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.
It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.
A lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.
What are some other time periods, Rachel?
Well, there's yore.
And, you know, yesteryear.
Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.
Ross, if you ever decide to redecorate-- --and I think you should-- --you should ask Rachel to help.
He doesn't need my help.
I think he's ready to get rid of the-- What'd you call it?
The "cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk"?
Really?
You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need-- Here's 60 bucks.
Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market.
.
.
.
.
.
and get me some stuff?
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
-I do want to.
-She does want to.
-She does want to.
-Yeah!
I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Ugh, look at this.
Pottery Barn.
You know what?
Don't look at it.
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!
There's the table they stole from us.
Oh, those bastards!
Let's go.
That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and.
.
.
.
Wait a second, this is our exact living room!
No, it's not.
Come on, ours is totally different.
I mean, we don't have the-- We don't have that lamp.
And that screen is on the other side.
Oh, my God.
This is where you got all our stuff.
Pottery Barn!
Oh, my God!
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.
I wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.
Because this stuff is what's wrong with the world.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's in my living room.
.
.
.
.
.
and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.
I can't!
I can't!
Unless.
.
.
.
Are you saying you'd move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
No, I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
-Yes!
I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.
But at least the apothecary table's real.
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?
I did.
I really did.
And I've got to say.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm sorry if I was weird after the last time we went out.
I guess I was just nervous.
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.
So we can go out again?
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.
See?
Wasn't that fun?
We have got to move.
What?
I knew it!
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!
I'm blah?
The only thing more boring than modern dance.
.
.
.
.
.
is you talking about it.
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost myself in the movement.
" You know, I know you're talking.
.
.
.
.
.
but all I hear is blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!
All right, enough!
Enough!
You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.
I really think you could take her.
You better hope I don't see you in the hallway!
All right.
Look, we got a little bit of a problem here.
You can't my treat my friends that way.
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.
They mean so much to me.
They're like my family, you know?
If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time.
.
.
.
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?
It can't.
I'm very upset.
Okay.
Would it help if I apologized?
Yeah.
That'd be very helpful.
What did I tell you about the hall?
I was coming over to apologize for my behavior.
I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so.
.
.
.
.
.
I would like that too.
-Great.
-Now, come on.
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.
-I'll see you.
-Bye.
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!
Wait!
You'd better run!
Did you hear that?
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?
Pretty much.
I can't believe you just broke up with her.
When it's not right, you know it.
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.
-You know what'd cheer you up?
-What?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.
I think you should come.
You're right, that did cheer me up.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hey!
You're not gonna believe this.
I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
They printed it.
I didn't know they print jokes.
They print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.
It's not just about the pictures.
Didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us.
Check it out.
It's the first one.
Right there.
That is funny.
It was also funny when I made it up.
-What?
-I made that joke up.
No, you didn't.
I did.
Yes, I did.
I told Dan and he said it was the funniest he'd joke ever heard.
Hey, tell Dan thanks.
What?
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
-No.
-Seriously?
You tell a lot of jokes.
Look, it's my joke.
But if it makes you feel better, they don't print the name.
So it doesn't really matter who gets credit.
Yeah, I guess.
-Hey, guys.
-Playboy printed my joke!
No, it's mine!
Call them!
They'll tell you!
-My joke!
-My joke!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jokes?
What.
.
.
?
You know there's naked chicks in there, right?
The One With The Joke Gelula/SDI Dude!
You have got to turn on Behind The Music.
The band Heart is having a tough time and they may break up.
Let's watch that at your place.
Monica's watching a show.
I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?
You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What?
No, I want to watch this.
-Did your cable go out?
-No.
No, that's VH1 .
I tell you, the music these kids listen to today.
.
.
.
.
.
it's a lot of noise to me.
Why is your cable out?
Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill.
If you need money, would you please let me loan you some?
No, Chandler.
Forget about it, okay?
I know things have been tight since Janine moved out.
God, was she hot.
I know, yeah.
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.
And Ross gave me this great book.
Want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch at his place?
Sure.
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.
It's only you.
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a Playboy.
I want to look too!
Yikes!
Do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?
Sure.
Like in the case of this young woman.
.
.
.
.
.
she has lost her clothes.
So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they"?
She's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that.
Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn.
.
.
.
.
.
Iift up your shirt and bend over?
You see, now, I would date this girl.
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.
I got a question.
If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
-I don't know.
-Me neither.
Rachel.
What?
I don't know.
Me neither.
You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had.
"Barracuda" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So you heard it, you repeated it.
.
.
.
.
.
so that must mean you wrote it.
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say.
.
.
.
.
.
I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What?
You didn't get it?
The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke?
Well, I think the Hef would disagree.
Which is why he sent me a check.
.
.
.
.
.
for $1 00.
So you stole my joke and you stole my money?
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
But now I think I'll show the sexy teller.
.
.
.
.
.
that I am a published writer.
She'll know that you stole the joke.
You gonna follow me there?
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.
Okay.
Here you go.
Gunther?
I can't pay now, because I'm not working.
I've had to cut down on some luxuries like.
.
.
.
.
.
paying for stuff, so.
.
.
.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
I don't know.
It's just.
.
.
.
See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
And to go from that to this, it's just.
.
.
.
And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Okay.
But the money's good.
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter.
Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel.
She tried to back out of it, but it was obvious.
She picked Rachel.
He took my joke.
He just took it.
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?
Phoebe picking Rachel.
Know who else picked Rachel?
Ross.
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.
I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Good idea.
Know what's a bad idea?
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.
Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain to steal my thoughts.
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.
Don't you guys look cute.
You guys make a cute couple.
What are you doing?
Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place.
Remember?
When you picked Rachel over me?
That was funny.
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!
Why would you do that?
Why didn't you pick me?
Fine.
The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you.
.
.
.
.
.
is just, you know, you're.
.
.
.
.
.
high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!
That is completely untrue.
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.
You write out a list, and we'll go through it point by point.
No, you're right, you're easygoing.
You're just not as easygoing as Rachel.
She's just more.
.
.
.
.
.
flexible and mellow.
That's all.
Well, people are different.
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.
What?
Are you saying that I'm a pushover?
I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay.
You're not a pushover.
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.
You're not invited to lunch!
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You start working on that list.
-I cannot believe her.
-I know.
Where do you want to eat?
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese.
Not there.
Wherever you want to go is cool.
Oh, hey, Gunther.
.
.
.
.
.
check this out.
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.
-I'll take a coffee.
Thanks.
-Sure.
-Coffee?
-No.
Coffee?
I'm going up there.
No, thank you.
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.
I'd love ice water.
You got it.
What are you doing?
Just being friendly.
You're not supposed to go back there.
It's okay.
Right?
Don't wink at me.
And put on your apron.
Okay.
I don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.
-Waiter.
-Yeah!
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?
It's kind of embarrassing.
I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
It's supposed to go the other direction.
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?
I guess if I'm hanging out here, I might as well get paid for it.
I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?
It'll be great.
Come on, I did it and it was fine.
Why would it be weird?
Hey, Joey?
Can I get some coffee?
It doesn't seem that weird.
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.
Don't eat yellow snow.
This is great.
Finally, someone I can pass my wisdom to.
Let me tell you some things I learned working here.
First, the customer is always right.
A smile goes a long way.
And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach.
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know?
How about clearing out so I can get some new customers?
It's all about turnover.
Seriously, can I get my coffee?
I'm sorry.
I'll get it right now.
And since you waited, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.
Okay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.
And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.
But you know what you are?
We are sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
That's true, I am flaky.
So, what, you're just okay with being flaky?
Yeah, totally.
Then I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah.
And I am okay with being a pushover.
That's great.
Good for you guys.
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!
-Who said you were?
-You did!
I'm flaky.
I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther.
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
I like your natural color.
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved.
" -That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.
I'll see you.
Oh, man.
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken.
" -Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.
But you believed me?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So you'd hire me, right?
For what?
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!
The coffeehouse will be closed for about an hour.
What?
It's for the kids.
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.
It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy.
I'm sure you all read about it.
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.
It's my joke.
I don't think we're gonna settle this.
Let's have Monica decide.
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!
-Monica?
-Okay.
You have to decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to?
You're the only one that can be fair.
I can't be.
You're my boyfriend.
But I'm your brother.
We're family.
That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her.
I'm your only chance to have a baby.
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke.
.
.
.
.
.
then you decide which one of us is telling the truth.
Me.
Chandler, you first.
I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?
You want me to pick you?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Two babies.
-Continue.
-Okay.
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
I said, "Dr. Monkey"?
And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding?
Okay, look, I study evolution.
Remember?
Evolution.
Monkey into man.
Plus, I'm a doctor.
And.
.
.
.
.
.
I had a monkey.
I'm Dr. Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
I've heard enough for my decision.
-Okay, so what--?
-Do tell.
You are both idiots.
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.
And doctors.
And monkeys.
You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world.
Now, let it go.
The joke sucks.
-It's your joke.
-It is not.
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
Why don't you tell them.
.
.
.
.
.
what you told me about me not being high maintenance.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.
Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
And what may be perceived as high maintenance.
.
.
.
.
.
is merely attention to detail.
.
.
.
.
.
and.
.
.
.
.
.
generosity of spirit.
Wow.
You know what?
That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really?
I've heard better.
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?
Look, I am not high maintenance!
I am not.
Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
You are on my list!
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not-- You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
And that's good.
And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good.
.
.
.
.
.
at making you feel better.
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance.
.
.
.
.
.
but it's okay, because I like.
.
.
.
.
.
maintaining you.
I didn't tell him that.
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.
Phoebe?
It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
I have the best boyfriend.
You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
How'd the audition go?
Oh, not good.
No.
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so.
.
.
.
Wow, that is a bad audition.
Well, how did you lose your job here?
I had the audition.
.
.
.
.
.
but Gunther said I had to stay so he could get his hair dyed.
So I went anyway, and he fired me.
He left work to do a personal errand.
.
.
.
.
.
and left you in charge when you've been here two days?
That's not right.
What are you gonna do?
You can't let him get away with that.
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say-- I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.
-It's not fair that you have to fire-- -Okay.
-What?
-He can have his job back.
That's right, he can have his job back.
Glad we got that all straightened out.
There you go, Joey.
-Got your job back.
-That's great.
Thanks.
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.
I never heard who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.
Yeah, I kind of thought.
-Never.
-It would totally be you.
If you had to pick one of the other two to go out with.
.
.
.
.
.
who would you pick?
-No way.
-I'm not answering.
Joey.
No way, I'm not answering that.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Okay, Rach, that's muffin and espresso, $4.50.
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.
And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1 .
25.
All together that's $1 2.75.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half.
How much do I owe you?
That's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Great.
Well, tell him thanks.
And since Joey seems like such a nice guy.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe we could go out?
He's not used to women being so forward.
.
.
.
.
.
but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.
Great.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
How come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.
I'm getting more dates than ever.
You're only giving free stuff to the pretty girls?
Joey, that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house, baby?
I'm pretty.
The One With Rachel's Sister Gelula/SDI -Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.
Here.
Sorry.
Oh, you know what?
No.
Wait a second.
-I know it's in here.
-You know what?
I'm good.
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!
I don't get sick.
Getting sick is for weaklings, it's for pansies.
No one thinks that you're a pansy.
.
.
.
.
.
but we do think that you need a tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years.
I'll get tissue.
I don't need a tissue.
I'm fine-d.
When you put a "D" at the end of fine.
.
.
.
.
.
you're not fine.
I'm fine-d.
I'm fine-d.
It's a really hard word to say.
-Yes?
-Hi.
Is Rachel here?
I'm her sister.
Oh, my God, Jill!
Oh, my God, Rachel!
Oh, my God, introduce us.
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.
-How you doing?
-Don't!
Honey, what are you doing here?
Which sister is this?
Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
You know what I said?
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer, sue you, take all your money.
.
.
.
.
.
and cut you off!
" Wow.
What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.
Then he told me to learn the value of money.
.
.
.
.
.
from the one daughter he's actually proud of.
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.
My dad's proud of me.
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
It wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.
This is the best thing that could've happened to you.
You've needed to get out on your own.
When I did it, at first I was scared, but then look at me now.
I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.
You're gonna get an apartment.
And you can stay with us.
Right, Pheebs?
Of course, yeah.
Oh, that's so great!
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, I like cars.
-You all finished?
-Yes.
Great.
Okay, here are the tips for this morning.
Jen gets 50, 50 for me and Joey owes eight dollars.
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.
If it's free, how come you're charging me for it?
Don't give anything away unless it's a birthday.
What if they came in third in a modeling contest?
No.
Sorry.
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.
How did you pay?
I thought your dad took your credit card.
I memorized those numbers when I was 1 5.
But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!
This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.
And these are my "Don't you want to rent me this apartment"?
pants.
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't qualify as making it on your own.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.
Rachel's not gonna think it's a good idea.
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!
What's going on?
Jill!
Did you shop?
No.
They did.
Yeah, we went shopping!
You went shopping?
Then you came here and paraded it under Jill's nose.
.
.
.
.
.
when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.
Sorry, Jill.
So what'd you get?
Oh, well, all right.
Thank you.
I got this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
And then I got.
.
.
.
These are apartment pants.
Apartment pants?
You never heard of them?
Of course, I've heard of them.
Ross, what'd you get?
I got this.
.
.
.
This.
-A Pashmina?
-Yeah!
I love these babies.
Really?
What's a Pashmina?
It's a rug.
Jill?
I'm sorry, Rachel.
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.
Right!
But I am sorry.
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.
But don't let it happen again, okay?
Okay.
Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.
And the pants.
I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
Alrighty.
I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah.
Everything but the little blue one.
That's the best one!
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much!
Well, hey.
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a Pashmina could be a rug.
Oh, yeah?
How about you with the "I'm sorry.
" Shut up!
I wasn't like that at all.
What about what I said about the apartment pants.
How dumb was l?
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.
Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Let's do something crazy.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest.
But if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all.
.
.
.
.
.
drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
Don't take this personally.
I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you.
I can't have sex with a sick person either.
Disgusting!
But I'm not sick!
Let me prove it to you.
We are two healthy people in the prime of life.
See, that's the thing, I would like to stay in the "prime of lime.
" What's up?
I think there's something you should know.
It better not be about the apartment pants.
I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
No.
It's just, I was.
.
.
.
I was with Ross and Jill after you left.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.
But I wanted to warn you that there might be something.
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.
With Ross and my sister?
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe that!
I don't like it when he dates anyone, but my sister?
Isn't that incest or something?
And they're gonna have sex.
Oh, no!
What if he marries her too?
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.
And Jill should be able to do what she wants to do.
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.
This is the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $3.85.
What?
Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.
It's just, I can't, because my manager said that l-- Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, dear Annie-- -Amy!
--Amy Happy birthday to you That's weird, today's my birthday too.
Not in here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late.
What's up?
I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
No.
But I walked past three sales and didn't go in.
How strong am l?
That is great.
You know who doesn't have to job-hunt?
Ross.
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?
So you guys talked?
So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?
Me go out with Ross?
No.
God, no.
What would make you think that?
Phoebe.
.
.
.
.
.
said she thought she saw something between you guys.
I mean, he's nice.
He's the kind you're friends with, but not the kind you date.
He's the kind you date, because you did.
But me?
Not so much.
Oh, not so much?
What do you mean?
ls there something wrong with Ross?
No, no, no.
He's just.
.
.
.
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.
Are you saying he's a geek?
You think so too?
No.
Ross is not a geek.
Then let's just say he's not my type.
Handsome is not your type?
Smart, kind, good kisser.
What, those things aren't on your list?
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.
If it means that much, then I'll ask him out.
Oh, no.
That's not what I meant.
You know what?
You're right.
He has been really nice to me.
Yeah, but he's not your type.
But maybe that's good.
I'm doing all these different things.
Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.
Yeah, but you don't want to try too much too fast.
You remember what happened to the little girl who.
.
.
.
.
.
tried too much too fast, don't you?
What?
She died, Jill.
Chandler!
What is it, honey?
You need some tea?
Some soup?
Calling Dr. Big.
Dr. Big to the bed.
Geez, honey, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room?
I was asleep.
No, honey.
You know what's sexy?
Layers.
Layers are sexy.
And blankets are sexy.
And hot water bottles are sexy.
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.
I want to make you feel as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest?
I'm fine.
Happy birthday to you -You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.
You've sung "Happy Birthday" to 20 women today.
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow!
I mean, wow.
I think she's cute, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I never would've thought of going out with her.
Never!
Really?
But after your okay, I figured, "Why not"?
Oh, so not really "never.
" I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean, after all we've been through.
I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
If you ever date Monica, you have my blessing.
And mine.
Chandler?
I think I'm sick.
Really?
Struck down in the "pribe of libe.
" Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.
Will you please rub this on my chest?
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.
Come on, I really need your help here.
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.
So you're just kind of rubbing it on yourself?
-Yeah.
-It's nice.
You kidding me?
ls this turning you on?
Yes.
Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good.
So, you want to go.
.
.
.
.
.
mix it up?
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!
What about never sleeping with sick people?
Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really want to have sex.
Worked like a charm.
Why are you here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date.
So, what do you think?
I don't like it.
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.
It's yours.
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi, Jill.
Hi.
.
.
.
Rachel.
You're not at home, you're right here.
Yeah, I know.
And I bet you thought it would be weird.
But it's not.
Okay.
So, well, I'll.
.
.
.
I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?
Is someone there?
Oh, yeah, it's me.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I'm just looking out your window.
.
.
.
.
.
at the view.
What are you guys doing?
We got some Vapor Rub in some places.
He brought her back to his apartment.
Who?
Is that your sister?
She is a slut!
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?
Oh, my God, he's taking off her clothes!
He's taking off her coat.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh, no, it's not.
It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna.
.
.
.
He's gonna get some.
Of the glare.
.
.
.
.
.
from the streetlight out of his apartment.
You know, so he's closed the drapes there.
.
.
.
.
.
so he can have a nice, pleasant.
.
.
.
.
.
conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm off to bed.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Oh!
Hey, Rach.
I was just coming over here to.
.
.
.
Wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.
I'm eating their food.
You?
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.
I didn't know we could date your sister.
We know you steal our food.
I'm good.
Drapes still closed?
Yeah.
That perverted couple two doors over should've shut theirs.
-Is that a swing?
-Oh, don't even ask.
I can't believe Ross is with her sister.
When Chandler kissed my sister, I was mad for 1 0 years.
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years left.
-Joey-- -Want to make it six?
The One Where Chandler Can't Cry Gelula/SDI Oh, Ross, hey.
Hi, how are you?
There you are.
Can I get a cup of coffee?
So how was your big date last night?
It was okay.
It was fun.
It was fun?
Great.
So did you guys hit it off?
I guess so.
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.
No.
No.
Nothing happened.
I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides!
So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened.
She really dug my slides.
And she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
Anyway.
.
.
.
If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?
-She asked you out again?
-Yeah.
Tomorrow night.
Valentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.
Who knows what could happen.
I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides.
Okay!
I got it, I got it.
I can't go with the "you and my sister" thing.
It's just too weird, all right?
I imagine the two of you together.
It just freaks me out.
I can't do it!
It's okay.
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.
Thank you.
After tomorrow night.
No!
I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay.
I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross, thanks.
Want me to call her now?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No.
Come on, I mean, that's crazy.
So, what's going on with you?
Well.
.
.
.
I may teach another class this semester.
Do it now.
Call her now.
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.
You know what's sadder than this?
Bambi.
I cried for three days with that movie.
No, two.
The third day my mom killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
Well, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
It's okay to cry.
You don't have to be macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.
Like.
.
.
.
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad, sure.
But I wouldn't cry.
What if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
All the other puppies pick on me.
" Cry?
I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!
I've got it.
I have got it.
Pictures from your childhood.
This'll get you going good.
Oh, what's going on there?
Parents' Day.
First grade.
That's me with the janitor, Martin.
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.
-Chandler!
-Poor thing.
That story doesn't make you cry?
No.
Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?
No!
It's not okay!
It's not okay at all!
You're dead inside!
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.
My biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you.
Sure.
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow, thanks a lot.
I just want to say I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.
Take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.
Bye.
So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh?
You want me to do a little Doctor Drake Ramoray for you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.
Oh.
You're Phoebe's fan.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen all her movies.
Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so.
No, it was.
She was in Sex Toy Story Two Lawrence of a Labia.
And I got her autograph.
The guys at the comic book store won't believe this.
Gunther?
Don't let that guy in here anymore.
He said Phoebe's a porn star.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.
You should check out lnspect Her Gadget.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Ross just totally blew me off, and he didn't even tell me why.
Oh, well.
The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.
Oh!
There is this great guy you will just love at work, named Bob.
He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Not random.
Bob.
It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough.
.
.
.
Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.
I'm so stupid.
I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
No, honey.
Okay.
Okay.
You want to know why Ross canceled the date?
Because I asked him to.
You asked him to?
-Why?
-Because you are my sister.
.
.
.
.
.
and Ross and I have this huge history.
You want to go out with Ross?
No.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to?
You know, Bob in Human Resources.
.
.
.
I can't believe you did this!
You had me doubting how smart I was!
You had me doubting my fashion sense!
It's not that big a deal.
Just don't date Ross.
There's other-- You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
This is not about me being jealous.
It's about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
Can't have?
Excuse me.
The only thing I can't have is dairy!
Well, you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
-Who?
-With Human Resources!
Jealous of her?
Who does she think she is, Princess Caroline?
-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
-Do I have my own castle?
Hey.
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.
Did you get a movie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Not more movies that'll have us reaching for the tissues all night?
Sort of.
What's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star!
-What?
-Yeah!
What are you talking about?
"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer.
" That's Phoebe.
Where did you get that?
At the adult video place on Bleecker.
And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him.
.
.
.
.
.
to surprise him.
Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.
Wow.
I mean, I just can't believe this.
I mean, you think you know someone.
Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
This is so bizarre.
I guess it makes sense.
She had such a terrible childhood.
I had a bad childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you're dead inside.
I'd better take that back.
What, why?
Why?
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.
We shouldn't watch this.
Absolutely not.
That goes back.
-Maybe a bit.
-The first half?
This is wrong, you guys!
Phoebe's our friend!
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!
Good for you, Joe.
I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.
Are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
What's that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well, it's hard to tell.
God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job.
You sick bastards!
It's a tattoo.
That's weird.
Phoebe doesn't-- Wait, that's Ursula!
That's not Phoebe!
That is Ursula!
Wait, wait!
I can watch that!
Rewind it!
Rewind it!
Hey.
What's up?
Oh, my God!
What am I doing?
!
Hey, sweetie.
"Chicken Soup for the Soul"?
There's no back to this couch.
You hate this kind of stuff.
I figured I'd give it a shot.
One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.
Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it.
Seriously.
We get married, I'm up at the altar and I'm like this: I won't care.
I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
And if we have a baby one day.
.
.
.
.
.
and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room.
.
.
.
.
.
and you don't cry, so what?
If we take him to college and go home.
.
.
.
.
.
and we see his empty room for the first time.
.
.
.
.
.
and you got nothing?
It won't matter to me.
Okay.
I won't worry about this anymore then.
And then, you know, if I die.
.
.
.
.
.
from a long illness.
.
.
.
.
.
and you're writing my eulogy.
.
.
.
.
.
and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says: "I will always be with you" .
.
.
.
.
.
and you still can't shed one tiny tear?
I know you'll be crying a river inside.
-I love you.
-What is wrong with you?
!
-What?
-What?
You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?
I left you a note from the beyond!
-So you didn't mean any of that?
-No, you robot!
You damn kids!
You ring my bell one more time and I swear-- Oh, Jill!
That's a game I play with the kids down the hall.
They've really taken a liking to me.
What's the matter?
Rachel and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?
I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore.
I don't know anybody in this city and I need somebody to talk to.
Sure.
What happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay.
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?
Seeing some more of your super cool slides.
-Wow, really?
-Totally.
I loved them.
You could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand.
I'd love to.
Wait right here, I'll go get the projector and my notes.
Thanks.
You're such a good friend.
Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her.
-No.
-Is Ross home?
Maybe I'll call him and see if he's seen her-- Who is it?
It's Phoebe.
.
.
.
.
.
"Phoebe!
" Hey!
Oh, God!
So you're making porn movies.
No, I'm not.
We're still rolling!
You're making one right now!
Let's go, Phoebe.
And you're using my name.
Can I help you with something?
Phoebe, come on!
Look, I'm talking right now.
You mean her.
Oh.
You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
What?
I could talk them into giving you.
.
.
.
.
.
thirty dollars.
No!
No way!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!
Especially you, with that!
The slides are almost ready.
Yeah.
I know what this is missing: Alcohol.
There's wine in the kitchen.
Oh, great.
What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
Okay.
Rach, calm down, okay?
She's really upset.
We're just talking.
She's making something happen with you to get back at me.
That's the only reason she could be here, huh?
It couldn't be that maybe I'm a good listener.
.
.
.
.
.
and I put on a great slide show?
Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
That was your sister, actually.
She thinks you're just using me.
So?
-Hey.
-Hey.
I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Oh, no, not you too?
I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a lot of them.
Nice!
And I won't have to go back there anymore.
.
.
.
.
.
because I gave them my "correct address.
" Isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?
Oh, no, I know how to handle it.
-Good.
-Yeah.
Trying to figure out how you know me?
I'll give you a hint.
From porn!
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
-See?
-Yeah.
Hey.
You may have been right about Jill.
I knew it!
What happened?
She kissed me.
What?
You kissed?
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
.
.
.
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Doesn't sound like it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.
You just don't.
Look at us right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me.
.
.
.
.
.
and I didn't stop it.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
Yeah.
Let me give you something to think about.
Hold on!
But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.
I realized if anything happened with me and Jill.
.
.
.
.
.
then nothing could ever happen with us.
-What?
-No, I mean.
.
.
.
I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us.
.
.
.
.
.
again, ever.
But I don't want to know that it never could.
So I stopped it.
.
.
.
.
.
and she got mad and broke my projector.
Wow.
I don't even know what to say.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My God, are you crying?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm not spending one more day with someone who's out to sabotage me.
That's you, Rachel.
Yeah, I got that.
And you!
I throw myself at you.
.
.
.
.
.
and you say no?
How gay are you?
You take care, Jill.
-Okay, see you.
-Bye-bye.
I can't believe Jill's gone.
I can't help it, I opened a gate!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, you guys, guess what?
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
What is the matter with you?
No.
Barry and Mindy.
Oh, sorry.
I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross.
Who's Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
That means he was falling asleep on her instead of me.
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
How different would my life be?
I've always wondered how different life would be.
.
.
.
.
.
if I'd never gotten divorced.
-Which time?
-The first time!
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I can't.
I keep seeing it the good way.
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.
Towards the end of our marriage, I did karate to release the tension.
.
.
.
.
.
from not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was pronouncing it ka-ra-tay.
What if I was still fat?
You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
-Sure I would.
-Come on.
You think I'm that shallow?
I think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives.
Hey.
Hey, there's Carol again.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow.
.
.
.
.
.
I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
-What?
-Merrill Lynch?
A massage client who worked there said I had a knack for stocks.
Why didn't you take it?
At that time, I thought everything that rhymed was true.
I thought if I worked with stocks.
.
.
.
.
.
I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
Do you think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
The One That Could Have Been Part 1 Gelula/SDI Oh, my God.
Rachel Green?
Rob Tilman!
No, no, it's me.
Ross.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ross Tilman.
-No.
No, no.
Ross Geller.
-Of course!
Monica's brother.
-Yeah.
Right.
-Wow!
How are you?
Good.
Good, I'm married.
Me too!
-Isn't it the best?
-Oh, it's the best.
-So how's Monica?
-Really, really great.
Actually, she's right down the street.
You should stop by and say hi.
-I would love to.
-She'd be so excited.
-Okay.
-Come on.
Wait, don't you have to pay for.
.
.
Busty Ladies?
No, that's okay.
Some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but l. .
.
.
So, Monica.
Still going out with Dr. Boring?
He's not boring.
He's just.
.
.
.
He's low-key.
-Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
-Thank you.
You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.
It's a seed.
Wow.
Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Oh, dear God.
Let me think.
What's the matter?
Another rejection letter.
They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic" funny.
I must get back to the hospital.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
By the way, the answer is: The Brazil nut.
Was his question, "What's more boring than him"?
Hey, man.
Sorry about that Archie thing.
You need some money?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
Joey doesn't have to give you money.
-TV stars have assistants, right?
-That's an idea.
If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her?
No, Joey.
Chandler could be your assistant.
He could answer your fan mail and stuff.
That would be great!
Let's do that!
I could use the money.
-Welcome aboard!
-Okay!
I need to use the bathroom.
Since I don't need assistance in there, take a break!
All right.
-Hey.
-Hey, Phoebe.
Joey just hired Chandler.
That's so sweet.
Oh!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Go!
No.
No, no.
I said sell when it hits 50!
Five-oh!
It's a number!
It comes after four-nine!
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
You're allowed one mistake.
Just kidding.
You are fired.
Hey, Mon?
Mon, look who I ran into!
Oh, my God, Rachel!
-God, you look terrific!
-So do you!
-Did you lose weight?
-You are so sweet to notice.
I lost 3 1 2 pounds!
You remember my friend Chandler?
And that's Phoebe.
Sit down.
How long's it been since we've seen each other?
Sean McMahan's party.
I played you one of my songs.
"Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
" Oh, yeah.
Right.
-So, now, do you still do music?
-Well, sometimes.
-Sometime I'll play you-- -Oh, my God!
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives just walked in here!
-Rach, he's a friend of ours.
-You're friends with Drake Ramoray?
It's hard to be Drake's friend.
.
.
.
.
.
because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Hey, or I could bring my keyboard here sometime.
-He's coming over.
-Joey?
I know.
Here, here.
No.
This is Rachel.
We went to high school together.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I love you on that show.
I watch you every day.
When you took out your kidney to save your ex-wife.
.
.
.
.
.
even though she tried to kill you.
.
.
.
It's always nice to meet fans.
-She's not crazy, is she?
-No.
So how you doing?
Hang on.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Go!
Who's this?
You're gonna like working for me.
What's your name?
What kind of name is Brindy?
Stop talking.
All right, from now on your name is Joan.
You can pick your own last name.
-There you are.
-Uh-oh, it's my boss.
Here's a list of things for you to do today.
This'll be so great.
Thank you so much.
Gotta go to work.
I'm delivering twins, but only one is mine.
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins.
" Teach me how to spell vitamins.
"Wear in my new jeans.
" You realize what you are, don't you?
You're his bitch!
No, no!
No!
Wait!
You didn't sit on my Kit Kats did you?
No, there was a little, little dip in the market.
.
.
.
.
.
and I lost $1 3,000,000.
But the Kit Kats are all right?
What am I gonna do?
My office will kill me.
I can't call my clients, they'll kill themselves!
-All right, now my chest hurts.
-What?
My chest hurts.
-And now, I can't breathe.
-Are you having a heart attack?
If I were, would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
-Yes.
-Then, yes.
That is what I'm having.
Oh, my God!
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.
Most people'd be excited if they didn't work for two weeks.
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.
I've been not working for three hours, and I'm already going crazy.
I miss Joan.
Honey, a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow down.
I always thought it was nature's way of telling you to die.
You're not gonna die.
I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today.
I wish I was dead.
Let's take a walk.
You should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.
What's going on with you?
Well, I've been doing a lot more of my karate.
-Still a dry spell with Carol?
-Yeah.
How long has it been since you've had sex?
-Well, last weekend.
.
.
-That's not so bad.
.
.
.
will be two months.
.
.
.
.
.
since I stopped trying.
You need to spice things up.
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.
Dirty talk, mÃ©nage Ã  trois, toys.
Role-playing.
You're warden, she's prisoner.
-You're the pirate, she's the wench.
-Okay, I think I got it.
You could be two stockbrokers, rolling naked on the trading floor.
.
.
.
.
.
and everybody's watching.
It never happened.
And over there is Brady's Pub.
.
.
.
.
.
where I unwind after a long day of "surgeoning.
" This is so amazing.
What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.
And that is an old man.
-Hey, old man!
-Hey.
Alrighty.
What do you say we head back to my place?
You know, I would really love to, but I shouldn't.
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning?
Just for a moment.
Just for us.
Isn't that from the show?
Yeah, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I may have said those things before, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I never truly meant them until now.
That's from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Thanks.
There's pulp in that.
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.
No pulp.
Pulp isn't juice.
All juice.
I'm sorry.
I guess I just like the pulp.
I'm sorry.
I am being so rude.
Rachel, would you like a soda or something?
Because Chandler will run right out and get it.
Yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Okay.
Anything for you, sir?
Did I not just tell him?
Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work.
.
.
.
.
.
you have got to listen.
You're gonna throw that juice at me?
It's not all juice.
Honey, this morning was fun.
Me hopping in on you in the shower there?
Yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe we can spice things up a little.
-What do you mean?
-Carol, our sex life.
It's just not-- -Dad!
-Hey there, little fella!
Why don't we get some shoes on you?
Show dad how you put your shoes on in your room.
Seriously, our sex life.
I was thinking maybe, I don't know.
.
.
.
.
.
we could try some new things, you know, for fun.
-Like what?
-Well, I don't know.
What if we were to.
.
.
.
.
.
tie each other up?
Some people eat stuff off one another.
Yeah.
You know, we could try dirty talk.
-We could have a threesome.
-I love that idea!
Who sold a story to "Archie Comics"?
Oh, my God, that's so great.
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present.
Wait a minute.
My last Kit Kat bar.
-You want to share it?
-Okay!
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.
I just.
.
.
.
I hate pulp.
You know how Monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and here.
-What's this?
-Fresh orange juice, with pulp.
-Just the way you like.
-Thanks, man.
Hey, Joey?
Chandler sold a story to "Archie Comics.
" That's great!
Congratulations!
What's the story?
You wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.
Well, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.
But he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.
So Reggie hires him as his assist-- --as his butler.
And makes him do crazy things.
.
.
.
.
.
Iike bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.
Did they already do that?
I think I read it!
Monica, listen.
I have to ask.
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.
-Does he do this with a lot of girls?
-Yeah, a lot.
A lot, a lot.
And I'm one of them.
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
It's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah.
I wish we could just not be married for a little bit.
You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break.
Well, you're not.
It's easy for you.
You can have sex with whoever you want.
Yeah, I can.
Don't think I don't.
I do.
I mean, all the time.
You bet!
Monica?
You've done it, right?
Of course I have.
What do you think, I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.
Louder.
I don't think the guy in the back heard.
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like I haven't had the opportunity.
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I'm seeing this guy.
He's not perfect.
.
.
.
.
.
but I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with.
You know, give him my flower.
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.
-You know what?
You are right.
-Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.
There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.
People should be able to sleep with whoever, whenever-- Rachel.
I'll never think it's okay to cheat on your husband.
What do you know, virgin?
Phoebe?
Why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?
The doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Put the cigarette out.
No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!
-Put it out.
-Okay, okay!
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Come on.
Give it to me!
-I got it.
-Give it!
Hello?
She can't come to the phone now.
Right.
No problem.
Okay, bye-bye.
Was it work?
Was it Jack?
Did he yell?
No, just relax.
Nobody yelled.
Jack was making sure you were getting better.
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
You've got to let her go.
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast, Wesley.
Ramoray!
That's right, Wesley.
Ijust stopped by to say that you're not a real doctor.
And that woman 's brain is fine.
Oh, thank God.
-Hope?
Hope?
-Drake.
You're not dying, Hope.
You're gonna live a long, healthy life.
With me.
Oh, Drake.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi, Joey?
It's Rachel.
I am free tomorrow night.
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
The One That Could Have Been Part 2 Gelula/SDI So, honey.
.
.
.
.
.
this threesome thing?
How are we even gonna find--?
Actually, I'm making a list of women I know who might be into this.
Boy.
Someone's been doin' their homework.
I know Gail Rosten is in there twice.
.
.
.
.
.
but she is so.
.
.
.
Oh, I know.
You know, just talkin' about it is gettin' me kind of.
.
.
.
I know.
Me too.
I think Ben's asleep.
You know, I think it'll be better if we just save it.
Right.
Save it.
I can do that.
How's it going?
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here!
Crazy!
Here you go, sweetie.
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.
Well, I put some honey in it.
-She doesn't know she was fired?
-No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?
But I think we should tell her.
I mean, it's just so realistic.
I know.
His name's Pat.
Pat the dog.
I get it!
Ready for a refill?
I probably shouldn't.
So I will!
-It's like it's raining.
-Pretty cool, huh?
But if you think a fish wouldn't get sucked into the mechanism.
.
.
.
.
.
well, you'd be wrong.
Can I use your bathroom?
It's right through there.
You know, I gotta tell you.
If someone told me a week ago.
.
.
.
.
.
that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment.
.
.
.
Life's pretty great, isn't it?
I hope you're hungry.
We're starting with oysters.
You know what they say about oysters, don't you?
They have parasites?
Some people say that oysters are an aphrodisiac.
-What people?
-People.
People say it.
Come here.
So, oysters, huh?
Then we'll have a little Middle Eastern couscous.
Something we can eat.
.
.
.
.
.
with our hands.
When we were studying communicable diseases-- It's sensual.
Didn't know.
Okay.
Sorry, it's the hospital.
The food looks great.
Save me some?
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this?
Looks like it.
If this is too weird for you, you can still back out-- I got it!
Thank you so much for coming.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
I'm Ross, by the way.
Hello, Ross.
-I love what you've done with the space.
-Thank you so much.
How hot is this?
!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here.
"Here's some little-known facts about couscous: They didn't add the second 'cous' until 1 979.
" Stop it!
That's not funny!
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just.
.
.
.
.
.
tonight was supposed to be a big deal.
-What was tonight?
-You don't want to know.
What was tonight?
Tonight was going to be my first time.
With Roger?
Not just with Roger?
Oh, my God.
All right, relax, Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!
Four different women!
I've had sex way more times.
How many?
Nine.
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
Good for you.
You really think Roger's the perfect guy?
No, but he's not a horrible guy.
That's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No, you are sweet and wonderful.
.
.
.
.
.
and it'll happen for you.
Oh, really?
When?
Do you want to do it with me?
I was kidding.
So was l. You're such an amazing actor.
How do you know where Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off.
.
.
.
.
.
and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake.
.
.
.
.
.
they always tell me what to say.
And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Tell me something.
-I just fell right off the couch there.
-Yeah, you did.
Here you go.
Let me ask you a question.
When was the last time.
.
.
.
.
.
someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Wow.
I can't feel my hands.
Come on.
Come here.
We can't do this.
Oyster?
If we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
Because you've waited a long time, and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
But I have nothing to compare it to.
Even if you were horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.
Well, if it helps, there were only three.
So it'd just be for tonight?
Absolutely.
It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it.
We're not doing this.
-Let's do it!
-No!
Okay!
Do you have any moves?
I have some moves.
I have no moves.
Whatcha doing there?
-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
-Yeah, forget it.
What if I turn out the lights?
That's the couch.
Oh, my God!
I know!
I'll tell you something.
We are gonna do that again!
Morning.
Oh, right.
Oh, God.
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up.
He actually saw you a little bit too.
Oh, God, we didn't.
.
.
?
Not after seeing that.
God, I'm just a horrible person.
Well, why?
Because I'm married.
That's right, I'm a married woman.
I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair.
That's ridiculous.
I'm not a "star.
" I'm just a regular famous actor.
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, will you stop saying that?
Hey, look.
Remember on the show when Capri was dying?
-And she gave me-- -The ring from the cave.
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?
Sure.
As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.
And I want you to have it.
No, I couldn't.
Every time you look at it.
.
.
.
.
.
I want you to remember that you are a good person.
Now, you had the chance to cheat.
.
.
.
.
.
and with me.
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.
But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
Look, you want the ring or not?
Hey, look at you!
You're up!
I thought I'd try to take a walk.
Will you pour me some water?
I'll be back soon.
You're not gonna call work, are you?
No.
I've learned my lesson.
Let's go!
Come on!
Move it!
Phoebe, come on!
Shoes, briefcase.
Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.
Hey, Joe.
.
.
.
.
.
did you ever have a threesome?
Look, Ross.
Carol's great, and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but.
.
.
.
No.
The reason I'm asking is that.
.
.
.
.
.
I sort of had one last night.
You?
All right.
So?
Was it amazing?
It was.
.
.
.
.
.
okay.
Just okay?
Did you do it right?
Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think: "Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here"?
But still, Ross.
Your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day.
It's just.
.
.
.
.
.
my part seemed to be over pretty quickly.
.
.
.
.
.
and then there was a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them.
Not really.
Just Carol.
-Not the other one?
-No, she kept kicking me away.
You don't want that.
At least you got to see a lot of stuff.
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
-You get a little bored?
-A little.
Made a snack.
-What'd you have?
-Just a sandwich.
Turkey.
A little mustard.
-Sounds good.
-It really was.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night.
Wait a minute, that was you.
Hey, check me out.
I'm a slut!
So you want to do something tonight?
I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over.
Oh, right.
Because you're still seeing him, and he's a good guy.
I remember a time.
.
.
.
Are you okay?
Yeah, totally.
Totally.
Are you?
Great.
It's so amazing.
Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous.
But after being with you, I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now"?
I bet he can.
"I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.
" -You sure you're okay?
-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
My God!
Barry!
You said you'd be away all weekend!
That's right!
I'm sorry!
I am early!
Finish, please!
Surprise!
Look who's back!
Call security.
Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
I don't think so.
-What are you doing here?
-All better.
Back to work.
This clown from research told me I was fired.
He should do his research, huh?
Well, you were fired.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.
Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Phoebe, you don't have an office.
I'll work right here.
This is good.
Next to this plant.
You're in my office.
I've made a lot of cash for this company.
I am talking big bucks!
Pesos!
Yen!
Rubles!
You make one little mistake-- You lost 1 3 million dollars.
So now this is all about money?
You know, it's bad enough that.
.
.
.
You have got to be kidding.
-Are you all right?
-I'm having another heart attack.
I'm having another heart attack!
Call 91 1 !
Dumb-ass!
Pheebs, how's it going?
They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack.
Well, welcome back.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
If you see him, please tell him I'm looking for him.
.
.
.
.
.
and that this time I am not gonna throw up!
Are you okay?
Me?
I'm great!
I'm fine!
I'm so good!
But you know who's not great?
Men!
You're a man, right, Ross?
Sit down.
Let me ask you something.
Do wedding vows mean squat to you people?
Why is it that the second we go out of town.
.
.
.
.
.
bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog-walker?
We're sorry.
No, seriously.
Seriously.
What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
-What are you, a detective?
I don't know what's going on with you and your husband.
.
.
.
.
.
and what is hopefully an adult dog-walker.
Look, can I just say, not all men are like that.
There are men who'll do anything to make their marriage work.
Men who will stand by and watch.
.
.
.
.
.
as their wives engage in what can only be described as a "twosome" .
.
.
.
.
.
with some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men?
Just men.
A guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife.
.
.
.
.
.
is gay.
She is not.
.
.
.
She's gay.
Oh, my God.
She is so gay!
I can't believe this.
Good day for married people, huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay.
I guess women aren't that great either.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Come in, eat, whatever you want.
Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah, I know.
Guess who beeped him?
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn't be with him.
You should be with me.
Really?
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me.
Things like last night don't just happen.
At least not to me.
I mean, with the other two women.
.
.
.
.
.
in the morning, I couldn't wait to go be with my friends.
But with you.
.
.
.
.
.
I was, you know, already with a friend.
You probably don't want to go out with me.
I make too many jokes, I've never been in a serious relationship.
.
.
.

.
and I'm not technically a "doctor.
" There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
It only takes two heart attacks To finally make you see One of them won 't do it But the second will set you free Tell all your hate and anger It's time to say goodbye And that is just what I will do Soon as those bastards I worked for Die!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Remember when I had a monkey?
What was I thinking?
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip?
Did I do something wrong?
You know what's more generous?
-You know what's even more generous?
-I see where you're going.
What's up with the greed?
I'm sorry.
I have to get new headshots made, and they're really expensive.
I'm down to, like, three.
Actually, two, because one of them I blackened some teeth.
Why'd I do that?
Isn't there something you can do to earn extra money?
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
It helps if you've got a little of this going on.
Wow!
I still have it.
Don't you have an audition today?
Maybe you'll get that job.
Wait a minute.
I used to get medical experiments done on me.
Finally, an explanation.
I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff.
Let's see.
.
.
.
Well, I don't want to donate sperm again.
I really prefer doing that at the home office.
Maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?
-Joey?
-Yeah.
What did I tell you about talking while working?
Do it?
That guy's been waiting 1 0 minutes.
He's complained about you three times.
Now, where was l?
The One With Unagi Gelula/SDI What are you up to?
We went to a self-defense class today.
Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.
Takes it out of you?
Now we can kick anybody's ass.
After one class?
I don't think so.
You want to see me self-defend myself?
Pretend you're a predator.
Go on, I dare you!
Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.
That's not enough.
Look, I studied karate for a long time.
And there's a concept you should be familiar with.
It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept.
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.
Maybe it means that too.
I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now.
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness.
Only by achieving true unagi .
.
.
can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.
In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat.
.
.
.
.
.
or your kettle of fish?
It's one thing being prepared for an attack against each other.
Whole other story being prepared for an, I don't know-- A surprise!
You knew that was coming.
.
.
.
.
.
but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
If we made reservations, we could have unagi in a half-hour.
-Is Monica here?
-No.
I need help.
I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
She was working, so we're celebrating tonight.
Why don't you book a day for both of you at those romantic spas?
That's actually a good idea.
And, of course, crotchless panties.
Appealing as that sounds to her boyfriend.
.
.
.
.
.
and her brother.
We promised to make each other gifts this year.
-I love that.
-You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties?
You take scissors and cut-- Okay, okay, okay.
Making things sounds so much fun.
I thought so, until I papier-mÃ¢chÃ©d one of my eyes shut.
I love papier-mÃ¢chÃ©!
What did you make?
I made a flar-lar-lar.
-What is that?
-Nothing!
So, what'll you do?
Have you made anything I can take credit for?
I have, I have!
I started making little sock bunnies!
Oh, for crying out loud!
Wait a minute.
That is my sock!
Now it's your little bunny friend.
Okay.
.
.
.
This actually is a flar-lar-lar.
Can I ask about the Valentine's Day gifts?
-Yeah.
-Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes.
Did you forget to make yours?
Of course not.
I just have to go to the place where I made it and pick it up.
I can't wait.
It'll be the best Valentine's Day ever!
I can't believe it!
Make the presents!
-What?
-Just so excited to make the presents!
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
With all due respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're at the end of a research cycle and not looking for applicants now.
That's too bad.
I've been saving up.
You sure there's no studies I can participate in?
-Here's a schedule of what's coming up.
-Thanks.
This one starts now.
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.
But it's $2000!
Sorry.
And this?
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists.
" Results are back on that one.
They're not good.
-That was good.
-Yeah.
Danger!
Danger!
What the hell was that?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
You're a freak!
Perhaps.
Now I'm curious.
At what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I took drastic measures to make my point.
I just want you to be safe.
Danger!
Ah-ha!
Unagi!
I wish I had a twin.
Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Chandler.
I sensed it was you.
What?
Unagi.
I'm always aware.
Are you aware that unagi is an eel?
-What's up?
-What should I make for Monica?
Why don't you make her one of your little jokes?
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?
You know what?
She'd love this.
It's a replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.
I could use that.
I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon.
" Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
You can write, "Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
" I can't give this to her.
-Why not?
-It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
And it says, "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Danger!
Salmon skin roll.
"Yes, honey, I made it myself.
" I can't do it.
I can't do it.
A mixed tape!
A mixed tape!
Hi!
Ready to exchange gifts?
-Sure.
You go first.
-Okay, come here.
Okay, it's not wrapped because I just finished it.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
What a great gift!
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
We'll have to listen and see.
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.
You ready to open yours?
It's a sock bunny.
Remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.
-That's what this is about.
-I see.
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.
I didn't make it!
I forgot about tonight and that we're supposed to make the presents.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
You're so incredible.
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape.
I'll make this up to you.
I will.
I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
You are way too young to have seen that.
Your birthday's in a month and a half.
What if I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely We've got to wash that.
Remember that jacket you loved that was too expensive?
You have done enough.
I'll wake up early and get it.
No-- Get it in black, not brown.
Your cake is ready.
It's like that old saying, "Have sex, eat some cake.
" Hey, Mon.
Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Joey.
"How are you doing"?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
How "you" doing?
How "you" doing?
Damn it, Carl!
Go wait in the hall.
I've got to apologize on behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?
Did I not mention?
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin for a medical research project.
Sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you.
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
The only problem is Carl's acting.
.
.
.
The only problem?
He's the reason I didn't get that big commercial two years ago.
We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed up.
Can I get a piece of that cake?
Pizza!
We like pizza!
Get out!
-Pat Sajak?
-Yep.
-Alex Trebek?
-Of course.
-Chuck Woolery?
-Definitely.
You will not find a single game show host whose ass I cannot kick.
-Say it!
-Say we are unagi!
It's not something you are, it's something you have.
Say it!
I could easily get out of this.
.
.
.
.
.
but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt!
Carl, we're next.
Now remember, what is this not gonna be?
-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
-That's right.
And what are you not gonna do?
-I'm not gonna talk because-- -Damn it, Carl!
Can I have the next one, please?
Thank you.
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
But this is a study for identical twins.
That's right.
$2000.
But you're not identical twins.
Damn it, Carl!
Oh, my good God.
Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals.
Tonight, number three: Macaroni and cheese with cut-up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.
I will.
But not tonight.
For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape that you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.
Dance with me.
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night, Chandler.
That's why I made you this tape.
Happy birthday!
Love, Janice!
No, you're the sweetest.
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.
Remember, be safe out there.
-Great class.
-Thanks.
I was watching.
A couple of questions: You know that last move.
.
.
.
.
.
where that woman tripped you and pinned you to the floor?
What would you do next?
She'd take the keys and jam them in your-- No, no.
What would you do next?
-Who, me, the attacker?
-Yes, that's right.
Why?
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.
What?
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.
In fact, I was married to one of them.
You attacked your ex-wife?
Oh, no.
No, no.
I tried.
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together!
That's a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry.
And I will cook anything you want in here.
And do anything you want in there.
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?
Come on, Monica, it's our Valentine's Day.
Please, please, please, please?
Okay.
My funny Valentine Sweet comic Valentine -So are we going in there?
-I am!
Your looks are laughable Nowhere to run.
I don't like sitting here.
I'm gonna go over-- No, they got here first.
-Why is Ross doing that?
-Danger!
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?
We should help them.
I don't think they need any help.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey.
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department.
" "Hotties of Paleontology.
" There's a big-selling calendar, eh?
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.
-You still have their exams?
-Yeah.
You could just match the handwriting and, boom, there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake, and he becomes Rain Man.
Wait a minute.
Why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl!
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.
-It's against the rules?
-It's frowned upon.
-Besides, there's a big age difference.
-When you're 90-- I know, she'll be 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No, that's not what I was gonna say at all.
When you're 90, you'll still have the memory of being with a 20-year-old.
The One Where Ross Dates A Student Gelula/SDI Chandler, you know your college friend who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.
-What's a movement class?
-He's pretending he didn't take mime.
She's directing a new AI Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.
I haven't talked to her in, like, 1 0 years.
Please, Chandler, I would owe you so much.
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000-- Hey, hey, dude.
Why you changing the subject?
What?
-Will you make the call?
-Okay, I'll try.
Thanks.
Last auditions are Thursday, so I gotta get in by Thursday.
Just remember Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah, so Tuesday?
Thursday!
Just think of it like this: The third day.
Monday, one day.
Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday.
.
.
.
When, huh, what day?
Thursday!
The third day, okay?
-Thank you.
-Okay.
-I'm gonna check my messages.
-You thought of that in there?
Sure, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.
Hello?
Rachel.
Someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
Fire department put out a fire at our place!
-Oh, my God!
How bad was it?
-It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.
-Come on, we gotta go!
-Yeah, come on.
What are you smiling about?
The part I want to audition for is a fireman.
This is so meant to be!
You were very generous with your grades this semester.
-Professor Geller?
-Yeah?
-I really enjoyed your class.
-Oh, thank you.
Thanks very much.
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a "hottie.
" -That was you?
-Yeah.
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher.
I'm a student.
Want to go out sometime?
That's not the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over.
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?
Oh, you know what?
Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A. -Gotcha.
-I'm kidding!
God!
So seriously, what time?
Coming through.
Coming through.
Oh!
Hello.
Hi.
Right.
Coming through!
Okay.
Well, it's not so bad.
Most of the damage was contained in the bedrooms.
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday?
-Excuse me?
-Joey!
He's working.
You would look good in that.
Oh, how bad is it?
It's bad, it's really bad.
The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
-How's your room?
-Everything's ruined.
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.
Isn't that mine?
Fine.
I'm sorry for your loss.
You won't be able to live here for a while.
You have a place to stay?
Oh!
Wow!
Okay, look, pal.
.
.
.
.
.
I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.
But if you give me your number, I'll call you sometime.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Do you know what started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
Well, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually.
But yeah, I could use one now.
Thanks.
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
-Yes, I do all the time.
I love them!
Oh, my God, I did it!
It's me, it's me!
I burned down the house!
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame.
Okay?
I warned her about those candles.
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.
Hey, Chandler, is that.
.
.
?
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it.
.
.
?
Okay.
So, yeah, maybe we can get together.
.
.
.
Can you hold on for one second?
What?
Do you want to get a pizza later?
Hi, I'm back.
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then.
Okay, bye.
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi.
We didn't get to the audition.
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.
Now you're going on a date with this girl?
I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years.
You can't just call up and ask somebody for a favor.
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.
Right, I'm sorry.
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.
You dated her?
!
Not once.
Why don't I just go out with an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor?
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.
That's great.
My friend Joey's in the movie business.
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently, Howie's editing now.
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe that?
You know, I haven't spoken to him in 1 0 years.
.
.
.
.
.
and he asks me for a favor?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No "How you doing"?
Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.
-The nerve, huh?
-Yeah.
Refill?
This is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, my God!
It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I know!
But there's only room for one, so one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Since the fire was kind of my fault, you should get to stay here.
Hey, hey, now.
This was no one's fault.
It was an accident.
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.
Okay!
You're the first guest at "Hotel Monica.
" Hotel Monica!
Just tell me how you like your eggs.
I thought I'd bring them to you in bed.
-You've been through so much.
-I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza.
And that's where the napkin is.
-What's that smell?
-I know!
I don't.
.
.
?
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.
What?
Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson.
" Who?
Oh.
I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames.
The guy on the other side of you was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt.
" Oh, yeah.
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No.
No.
Yes, you did.
What was it?
"Cutie McPretty.
" Oh, that's so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing?
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
-Dr. Geller!
-Burt!
Did you sleep well last night?
-I did.
-Yeah?
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.
Know what Joey left on my pillow?
Gum.
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know.
It was my candle, my candle!
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.
-I don't use a curling iron.
-Someone does.
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.
-It could've been a hair-straightener.
-Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza.
And-- Hey, where'd the napkin go?
I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.
Thanks, Monica.
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?
I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.
-I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
-Okay.
Hello?
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Phoebe.
Really?
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener.
.
.
.
.
.
that started the fire.
No, no.
It was the candles.
Yeah.
It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is.
.
.
.
.
.
okay, well I have to go now.
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.
I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
A concept lost on some people.
It's okay to date a student?
Well, not really.
Technically, it's not against the rules.
But it's frowned upon, especially by the professor we saw last night: "Judgy Von Holier-than-thou.
" You don't want to get a reputation as "Professor McNails-his-students.
" -Yeah.
What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Joey, that's so sweet.
-Hi.
-Hey!
So how'd it go with Dana?
Any reason I should leave a block of time open?
Say, Thursday?
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.
You're going out with her again?
-Going out with who?
-Dana Keystone, from college.
Oh, yeah.
Wasn't she.
.
.
?
No, that was Dana Kaplan.
Oh.
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.
Great story again.
The yarns that you weave!
Woo-hoo!
You know, actually I should get going.
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.
Wow.
Oh, I am really flattered.
But I just.
.
.
.
I don't feel that way about you.
Oh, no, no.
That's not-- I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy.
.
.
.
.
.
and I don't want to hurt you.
I wish I could do something to make you feel better.
No-- Really?
Of course.
Well, it just hurts so bad, l. .
.
.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What?
Anything.
Anything.
Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now.
But I have this friend-- This actor friend.
He would kill me if he knew that I was doing this.
But.
.
.
.
.
.
would it be possible for him to audition for your movie on Thursday?
Absolutely.
But.
.
.
.
.
.
you'd really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie?
The heart wants what it wants.
Bye.
Hey!
How's it going?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes, it has.
I made cookies!
I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now, because they're hot from the oven.
Okay.
But not in here!
Can't eat them in bed, remember?
No crummies!
Oh.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Okay.
-What are you doing?
-This doesn't lock, does it?
-Oh!
Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.
-Really?
-Yeah, look.
Yeah.
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?
I can't.
-Oh, you have some studying to do?
-No, I have some turning 21 to do.
You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to-- -What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
No, of course I do.
Are they gone?
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.
What?
No, no, wait, wait-- You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.
Come on.
Burt.
Lydia.
Mel.
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.
Aren't you in my popular culture class?
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.
And we're dating.
And you may frown upon that but.
.
.
.
.
.
we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired.
-What?
-They'll fire you.
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.
Really?
It's not just frowned upon?
I love it at Joey's!
-Nice!
-Thanks.
So, you busy Thursday?
Oh, very funny.
Remember?
My audition was supposed to be Thursday.
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!
Okay, okay!
What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
-Hey.
-Hi.
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
I know they said the hair-straightener started the fire.
But I think I'm partly at fault.
You see, I didn't tell you, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I had recently refilled the tissues.
And so, let's face it, that's just kindling.
So I think it's fair that I stay at Joey's.
No, no, no, this was my fault.
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Okay.
-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
-Really?
-She said something about crummies.
-No, no, no!
I was so careful.
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.
That's right.
All the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No, I don't want to switch.
Please!
I can throw wet paper towels here!
No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.
I know.
I'm sorry.
All right, fine.
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
That felt really nice.
Kind of made me like you even more.
I know, I know.
I really like you too.
But we can't date.
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.
Wow.
What?
Just hearing you describe it as "forbidden" .
.
.
.
.
.
it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's wrong.
-Stop it.
-No, no.
It's wrong.
It's naughty.
It's.
.
.
.
.
.
taboo.
Shut the book.
Hey.
Let's also get a hot plate.
Hey.
Hey.
So?
So.
.
.
?
It's Thursday!
How was the audition?
It's-- Monday, one day.
Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday, what day-- Oh!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
All right.
Damn fridge!
-Hi, Joey.
How ya doin'?
-Great roomie.
-Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
-I know.
Now that you bring it up, our fridge is broken.
We have to get a new one.
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that.
I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born.
Okay?
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!
What does that tell ya?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people?
All right, you know that the ATM only lets you take out $300 at a time, so l'll take a check for the other $100.
You're jokin', right?
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.
Thank God, you're pretty.
The One with Joey's Fridge Hi!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Chandler.
There's a big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table so I kind of have to go.
-What's the charity?
-I don't know.
Something, either trees or disease.
Ralph mumbles a lot.
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
-Yeah.
It's weird.
But the thing is, I need to find a date.
What type are you looking for?
Someone that has his own tux or the ability to rent a tux.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
So close.
-Hi, everybody!
-Hi, there.
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi, Elizabeth.
I'm a student.
Isn't she cute?
Nope.
This is none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
We're not together.
No.
We're just two people who happen to have run into each other here.
This is.
Oh, sly!
I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
-I'll see ya later?
-Okay.
-Bye, Ross.
-Bye.
See you.
-Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
-That is quite all right, ma'am.
Bye.
So, why's she leaving?
ls it a school night and she has a lot of homework?
Yes.
Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.
Anyone else?
Bring 'em on.
-When's her birthday?
-I don't know, Rachel.
Why?
Well, you know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.
In fact, I like her so much that you tell her I want my cookies early this year.
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, it's actually been great.
She's 20, so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me now.
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.
I know you guys like giving me a hard time but it means a lot to me that you like her.
-Just knowing you guys are, like-- -Okay, I got a good one.
What is she, like 12?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah.
Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?
Okay.
I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take.
That's so funny 'cause we found someone, too.
That's good.
I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-'Cause that's just your taste.
See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
My guy is a lawyer who does volunteer work.
And, he has one of these.
A face ass?
A chin dimple.
Well, our guy works with Chandler.
And he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser.
-Have you seen your guy's body?
-No.
Our guy's just a floating head.
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.
And one time, when he was on the table, I looked at it.
And I mean, all of it.
-You're not supposed to look.
-Yeah, like there are police for that.
What, you look?
You massaged me.
I know.
All right, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Chandler funny?
-Our guy's a great dancer.
-My guy's well-read.
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.
Our guys smells incredible.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Well, you don't look good, Joe.
Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
What was in that brown jar?
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.
So, anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you're providing me?
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.
"Our" new fridge?
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?
Look, okay, suppose we were a divorced couple.
And I got custody of the kid.
Right?
Now suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid.
Okay.
Gimme $400!
Professor Geller?
Oh, a student I don't know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.
Of course.
Why don't we go inside.
-What?
-Doorknob.
Sorry.
I actually do need to talk to you.
Okay, what about?
-Spring vacation?
-Spring vacation?
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips-- -Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?
I'll be with you in one moment.
So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand.
Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her.
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth.
You're not ready.
I could do that.
-Well, what if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Or, you could just, you know, you.
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell am I doin'?
You just broke my fridge!
What?
How do you know it.
How do you know it's even broken?
You think I don't know what breaks my fridge?
Excuse me!
Well, what do you know?
Broken!
That'll be $400.
Joey, I saw you push him.
You pushed him?
Joey, I did not break this.
Okay?
That has been broken for a while.
Chandler, remember I told you about our fridge?
I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.
Do not give him any money!
I'm not talkin' to you!
You broke my fridge!
-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
-Yes.
Please come in.
-Doorknob?
-Yeah.
It kind of grows on you.
Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
Good.
Look, l. I've been having a great time with you.
And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
So, I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
It's too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No.
I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
What I meant was-- You are so adorable.
That.
Let's talk about that.
-Hi.
-Hi.
How did it go with Elizabeth?
Fine.
It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.
She just wanted to tell me that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait, is she going for spring vacation or spring break, wahoo?
What's the difference?
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.
-What did you do on yours?
-I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!
" I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than: "Spring break, wahoo!
" All right?
Come on, she's taking my class.
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.
You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
We just met at the newsstand.
We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream.
What?
I read that.
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes.
Thank you.
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?
You ask us to find you a guy and then you come in here with a guy of your own.
You found me a guy?
Yes, we found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work.
Yeah, and I found you one, too, who is not a weirdo.
You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that but I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.
Would you stop it with that already?
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
-No, not really.
Why?
-No reason.
It's just I know a single guy who does care about other people.
Are you funny?
-Excuse me?
-What are you guys doing?
Are you funny?
Tell us a joke!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you-- -Give me a call sometime.
-But you didn't give me your number.
Okay, see you later.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I cannot believe you guys!
He was really nice and he just left because of you!
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?
You know what I noticed, Rachel, he scares easy.
Now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball?
"Sebastian, would you like to dance"?
"Okay.
I gotta go".
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.
That is a very insensitive thing for us to do.
You know what?
Let's make it up to you.
We've two great guys for you.
Yeah, what have you got to lose?
You might even end up with someone really special.
If you pick my guy.
-All right.
-Okay.
So, you will meet our guys?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.
Our guy is perfect.
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed was unsuitable for herself.
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.
You owe me $400.
-Okay, sure.
-Really?
Technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last 10 auditions.
Call it even?
Okay.
There you are.
So, what did Elizabeth say?
Turns out she is going to Daytona for "spring break, wahoo!
" That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies waking up next to people you don't even know.
She is gonna have a great time!
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
-You know the hotels?
-I was there!
Spring Break '81, wahoo!
In 1981, you were 13.
So what?
I drove down, sold T-shirts.
I had a blast.
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-Nothing.
Just be cool with it.
What if she goes down there and then sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
Yeah, I've been working so hard this semester.
I really need to go crazy, blow off some steam.
Sure.
Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but l know another great way to blow off steam.
-What?
-Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay?
Yeah.
Of course I'm okay.
I'm just being supportive.
Supportive of you and this whole trip and what's this?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive?
Is this?
Okay, good.
-Hi.
-Hi.
We're so glad you decided to meet our guy.
You're gonna like him so much.
-When do you want to meet him?
-I don't know.
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.
But why put off something 'til tomorrow when you can do it right now.
-Eldad, come here!
-What?
-Eldad, this is Rachel.
-How are you?
A little blind-sided, but, you know, good.
Eldad, sit down.
Move over now.
There you go.
There you are.
Okay, we can take a hint!
What?
What are you doing here?
This is Patrick.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You're too late, because she's already with our guy.
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.
Come on.
Rachel?
This is Patrick.
-Hi.
-Hi.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Okay.
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Okay.
Have a seat.
-You can't do that!
-Maybe I should go.
Just sit down, we're winning.
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should go.
No.
Have a seat!
Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
-It is the softest hair.
Touch it.
-I'm good.
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.
Phoebe, this isn't really worth the free massage.
-That's right, Patrick.
Bye-bye.
-No.
Eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance.
You dance for Rachel.
No, don't dance for me, please!
What is the matter with you guys?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys.
This is ridiculous!
Thank you, but I do not need you to get me a date.
-Then why did she ask us to help her-- -I am still talking!
Then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked.
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on all the cash.
And you really do have very soft hair.
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through more of this.
Goodbye.
Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
Yes, papaya extract.
Thank you.
So, have a great time down there.
-I will.
-Yeah.
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while.
Anyway.
I am worried about that bathing suit.
Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.
No, I'm concerned about your health.
Sun exposure.
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
-It's SPF 30.
-All right.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
I mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4 and I swear more often than not, it's just milk.
Ross, it's gonna be okay.
I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Okay.
Cool.
Here they are!
Call me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.
The charity was a big success, they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, what was it for, anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said to turn on MTV.
I don't know.
Oh, my God, look!
That's Elizabeth!
Professor Geller.
To be 13 again.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
"We've got three minutes till the reactor blows.
"We'll never make it!
" "You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!
" "No, I won't leave you".
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot.
I'm just a machine!
" -"No, you're not.
Not to me".
-Oh, my God.
-What?
-I am extremely talented.
-Yeah.
You're great.
-Yeah.
-Okay, let's take it from-- -No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.
I thought I was pretty good, too.
Yeah, you're solid.
You're just no me.
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.
Fine.
I'll do it without you!
I don't need you or anybody else!
I'm gonna make it on my own!
You'll see!
You'll all see!
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. So, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
It's a new TV show.
Yeah.
I'm up for the part of Mac, Machiavelli, or "Mac"!
I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner.
He's a computerized humanoid electronically enhanced, secret enforcer.
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E." -So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!
They really lucked out that the initials spell "cheese".
That is lucky.
So Joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like the star of your own TV show.
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese" or the "Big Mac".
Hey, you love those!
Don't get your hopes up, because it's probably not gonna happen.
Now, why would you say that, Joseph?
Well, I mean, come on you guys.
My own TV show?
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.
What are you talkin' about?
You're a terrific actor.
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?
-She's pretty.
-Yeah.
And she's really nice, too.
She taught me all about, you know, how to work with cameras and "smell the fart" acting.
-I'm sorry.
What, Joey?
-What?
Excuse me?
It's like you got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.
So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense.
You know, like this.
Okay.
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!
Mrs. Wallace?
I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey, your sister's neurosurgeon.
You sister is suffering from a. Well, Eva, we've done some excellent work here.
And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.
"All you want is a tinkle "What you envy's a schwang "A thing through which you can tinkle "Or play with or simply let hang" I play AI Pacino's butt.
All right?
He goes into the shower and then, I'm his butt.
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.
This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it, and that's big!
No, it's terrific.
You deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
Okay, fine, make jokes.
I don't care.
This is a big break for me.
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.
So, you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
All right, I'm out of here.
Wish me luck.
"Good luck, good luck We all wish you good luck" Yeah, whatever.
It's your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?
Hi.
How did the audition go?
Terrible.
I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.
Wait.
Are you doin' that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
-Yeah, did I fool ya?
-Totally!
-So, it did go well?
-It went amazingly well!
-Great!
-That's great.
-It's down to me and two other guys.
-Oh, my God!
I know both of them, and they're really good.
One's from those allergy commercials who's always being chased -by those big flowers.
-Oh, I love that guy!
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00.
I feel like my head's gonna explode.
Well, it is overdue.
Don't worry, okay?
You're gonna be fine.
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.
No offense, but what you guys all do is very different.
I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
-Is it dirty?
-No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't.
I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatoes.
Are they firm?
They're all right.
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?
No, really.
They're okay.
You gonna slice 'em up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.
I'm out of here.
Monica, I'm quitting.
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it.
I'm quitting.
That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Oh, my God.
And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
You ate my sandwich.
It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.
Really?
Now calm down.
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.
You threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?
My sandwich!
It's just, I want this part so much, you know?
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.
No, I didn't say that.
That doesn't count.
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.
I just moved across the hall.
And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies.
You're right, I could never lie to you.
She hates you.
Should I get that?
Hello?
No, Joey's not here right now.
Can I take a message?
Yeah, okay.
So the audition's been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?
Okay, great.
Bye.
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Okay.
I was just talkin' to the guys.
Just look at 'em.
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
What about my allergies?
Right.
Your allergies.
All her.
She hates you.
Yes!
All right.
How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-size version of this?
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?
Hello?
What are you talkin' about?
The audition's not 'til 5:00.
Well, nobody told me.
Who'd you talk to?
Never mind.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part.
Thanks.
Maybe we can fix it, you know?
Maybe we can send him some big, big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me?
This part could've turned my whole career around.
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?
-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for ya.
Taught ya how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.
If there was anything I could do, I would do it, okay?
But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
He could have gotten me a VCR.
He could have gotten me golf clubs.
But no, he has to get me the "Woman Repeller".
The eyesore from the "Liberace House of Crap!
" -It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.
You don't have to sport a reject from the "Mr. T" collection.
Chandler.
Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do!
I do!
I pity the fool that.
When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and one thing led to another and.
And what?
Did you sleep with her?
-No!
No, I just kissed her.
-What?
That's even worse!
-How is that worse?
-I don't know!
But it's the same!
You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.
"Over the line"?
You're so far past the line that you can't even see the line!
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!
I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me.
But you're not perfect.
You've made some errors in judgment, too.
Name one!
What happened?
Man!
He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?
This guy came by to look at the unit and he said he didn't think it was big enough to fit a grown man.
So you got in voluntarily?
I was tryin' to make a sale!
Man, if I ever run into that guy again, you know what I'm gonna do?
Bend over?
There's Lori.
Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.
Well, well.
Look what you brought.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh, my God!
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
What?
No way.
I've been goin' to the guy for 12 years.
You said he was gonna do my inseam then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite.
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
Ross, will you tell him?
-Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
-Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!
I said name one!
-I can't believe I did this.
What an idiot!
-Stop beating yourself up.
People make mistakes.
These things happen.
I hope there aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there?
Apparently, you're not very good at it.
-Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
-Of course he will.
Chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself.
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?
That was pretty bad what you did.
You know what?
He will forgive you.
I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone, just in case.
Okay?
You didn't see how mad he was, you know?
I'm sure he will forgive you.
Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.
That's the way it works.
It took two people to break up this relationship!
Yeah!
You and that girl from the copy place which yesterday you took full responsibility for!
I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for, okay?
I didn't finish the whole letter.
-What?
-I fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
It was 5:30 in the morning.
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Front and back!
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are".
Y-O-U-R means "your".
I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you.
We are so over!
Fine by me!
And just so you know, it's not that common it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
I knew it!
You had no right to go out with him.
That is the most ridiculous-- -You sold me out!
-I did not sell you out!
-Yes, you did!
You absolutely sold me-- -Would you let me talk?
Did you just flick me?
Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish and I was just-- Stop it!
-Stop.
-Stop.
-All right.
No, let's not do this.
-No!
-Happy thoughts.
-No!
-Happy thoughts.
-No!
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
All right.
Now, I will let go if you both stop.
-Fine.
-Fine.
There we go.
You know what?
lf we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearin' everything you own.
Oh, my God!
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearin' any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando".
I tell ya, it's hot with all this stuff on.
I'd better not do any lunges.
"I think of all the friends I've known "But when I dial the telephone "Nobody's home "All by myself "Don't want to be all by myself "Anymore "All by myself" Joey?
Got you the Joey special!
Two pizzas!
Hello?
Damn it!
Hello?
No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message.
I think.
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!
Well, no, obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.
Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message.
Thank you.
Yes!
Okay.
Mac audition at 2:00.
Allergy actor attacked.
By dog not flowers.
Please tell me you got the message.
-What message?
-The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
-They needed to see you at 2:00.
-What?
It's 6:00!
Look!
I wrote it!
I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it down, then went lookin' all over for ya!
I went to Ross's, the coffee house.
I went to any place that they make sandwiches!
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say!
You might say, "Congratulations!
" I saw the board, I went to the audition, I got the part!
Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.
-I'm sorry.
-At times that fake-out thing is just mean.
Okay, man.
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well, that's good.
Because ya didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for ya!
That's mean!
-You had me goin' there!
-We could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right.
Look, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be.
You are gonna be a huge star!
I'm gonna hug ya!
-You hug me!
-All right.
"You've really got a hold on me "You've really got a hold on me "Baby!
"I love you "And all I want you to do is just Hold me "Please "Squeeze me, hold me" -Do we do this too much?
-I think so.
-Yeah.
Get off me.
-Yeah.
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you.
"Try routing your backup power source through your primary CPU".
"I can't!
My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!
" "Well, then I'll just have to carry you!
" "That'll be a neat trick "when you're dead!
" Ross, you don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent.
In fact, for a minute there, I was like, "Where did Ross go"?
Thank you.
And I have to say that first scene where you meet Mac.
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God.
I mean.
And you know what?
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.
-Holding us back.
-Totally.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
-Okay, Chandler.
-Okay.
And your horoscope says: "On the 5th, a special someone will give you a gift".
Well, thank you in advance.
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat".
You're going to make a joke about my special present.
Why would you do that?
Wait.
"On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself".
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.
Oh, my God!
It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. That's right.
It's your first day.
Are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I psyched?
The lead in my own TV series?
I've dreamed about this for years!
Why have I not been preparing?
Joey, you're gonna be great.
But I gotta act with a robot.
I don't know anything about technology.
I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn.
And that's only because it's there when you turn it on.
Our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad Are you judging them by their covers?
Because you're really not supposed to.
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to start writing another book.
Because the last one was such a big seller?
Well, if you must know, I have written 14 books.
And as I'm the only one who has read them l can tell you that they have all been very well received.
What are you doing later?
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
-We do?
-I want to see what he wants first.
I just found out Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute.
Hold the phone.
You're not Elizabeth's dad?
Come on, guys.
I really want this guy to like me.
It would really help me out if you guys could be here to make me look good.
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.
We know how tough those parent-teacher conferences can be.
-So, here's your office set.
-Wow!
Mac Machiavelli, Private lnvestigator.
Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting.
When do I meet the robot?
Why don't we do that right now?
He's right here.
Joey Tribbiani, this is-- Wow!
He's so lifelike.
Unbelievable.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E. How do you do there, buddy?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted?
Sorry about that.
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you, Mac.
-This is the temporary robot, right?
-No.
Why?
Well, I just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot.
Like the Terminator, or when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine.
It's absolutely state of the art.
Sorry.
It doesn't look like it can do anything.
It can do this.
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It's great to meet you, Paul.
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course.
Mr. Stevens.
So, Ross what's your problem?
Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
It's funny.
It's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.
Okay, I can see that.
I think if you give me one chance, I can change your mind.
-Okay.
-What?
Okay.
I'll give you one chance to change my mind.
You've got one minute.
-Daddy.
-Fine.
Two minutes.
Go.
A minute and 50 seconds.
I want you to know, I have never done anything like this before.
I mean, I've been in relationships in general.
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not.
Not "it".
We haven't done "it".
I mean, we've done stuff.
Okay.
A joke.
Lighten the mood.
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is lrish.
-I'm lrish.
-And the lrish guy wins the joke.
Ross!
How crazy that we would run into you.
Oh, my God!
Thank you.
I 'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
So you're Elizabeth's father?
I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born.
I raised her by myself.
I get that a lot.
Why don't we all take a seat?
I'll get us all some coffees.
Yeah, why don't you.
And you guys can talk about whatever you want.
Whatever pops into your head.
It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day because usually he's at the children's hospital.
But not looking for dates.
Monica is Ross' sister.
He's a great brother!
I had a sister.
She passed away.
You don't have to do that every time.
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.
Funny story.
Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
A part of him did, yes.
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
I hope you guys are finding something to talk about.
-Yes.
We were just-- -Sorry I'm late.
But I am ready to talk you up.
When does Liz's father get here?
I'm already here.
Ross is so great!
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
You said we would get the kind with the baby.
-You said the baby creeps you out.
-The little girl does.
-You said, "the baby".
-Why would the baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
I'm sorry.
Can you please talk a little slower.
-This is for your book?
-It's about relationships.
You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
Keep going.
This stuff's great.
Excuse me.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.
-I left my keys here somewhere.
-Well, let's look for them.
Hey, look!
Are these them?
No.
All right.
-Here they are.
-Good.
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait!
Sorry!
-Mr. Paul?
-Just call me Paul.
Paul.
I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Maybe you could date him then.
It would save me the trouble of killing him.
Are you okay?
You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
We?
Yeah, it usually takes two people to.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Of course.
I know that!
What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
I'm just me.
My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
So you raised her all on your own?
Yes, I did.
How was your first day?
Pretty good.
Except I got a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots.
They're supposed to be our faithful servants!
It was the guy who controls the robot.
He doesn't like me.
He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table right when I was reaching for one.
Why don't you get him fired?
I may have to.
I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?
There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe!
I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.
The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.
It's the lead in a series.
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey?
Hi, Ross.
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey!
Ross, Joey is not here.
I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay.
You can come out.
Yeah.
It's okay.
It's me Mr. Stevens.
I didn't.
Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.
You did.
You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
You were shouting, "Joey!
" -Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.
I'll call you later.
-See ya!
-Bye, Ross.
What?
What the.
How did.
What?
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.
In your mouth?
No!
Downstairs.
And we got to talking for two hours.
I liked him.
I invited him for a cup of coffee.
You were at the coffee house!
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy?
He's my girlfriend's father.
It's weird!
-You dated my sister!
-That was different!
-What?
Why?
-This is weird for me!
Ross, look.
This is good for you.
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving ya.
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.
Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer!
-How is that important?
-It's important!
There's a million guys out there who can play Mac and there's only one robot.
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.
What am I gonna do?
You're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks.
But I have a problem to deal with.
No, sweetie.
You've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E. Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea!
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.
I got some saved for you, Pheebs.
Do you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yeah.
That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
You wish.
"You wish".
Stop writing about us.
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.
Fine.
Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair".
-I see what you're doing.
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing".
I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Morning!
How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy?
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.
Level with me.
I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
They even have actors coming in to read for my part.
Come on, man.
You gotta give me a second chance.
I love this little guy.
That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right?
I can't believe this!
God!
Hey, how are you doing?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
What a nice story.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as-- Look.
I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie and partly because they just keep coming to me.
I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me and the many stories that Rachel has told me well you're not all bad.
"Not all bad".
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.
I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.
I know what you mean.
I do that, too.
-I beg your pardon?
-I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.
I mean, I have a son who is six and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son?
My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.
Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife.
I'm sorry.
It's unbelievable!
Don't worry.
I just didn't realize you were married.
We were.
But that was just a. That was just a big drunken mistake.
You're back.
You two were married?
I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.
We said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00.
We said 7:00.
We said 6:00!
The only way that I said 6:00 would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00".
If I had said 7:00, I would have said: "My boyfriend is such a wiseass.
7:00!
" -Hi!
-Oh, my good God!
-I know what time you said.
-What?
Well, actually I know what time Chester and Marsha said.
What time?
What an interesting turn of events.
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.
Very interesting.
Well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks.
So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
"Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.
Chester thinks it's 7:00".
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-That's right.
Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis".
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?
Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah?
I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.
I hate you.
You ruined my life.
-Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, Chandler.
-Hi.
How are you?
Joey, I'll get you your job back if you help me out.
Why should I help you out?
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?
I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.
Her.
All of them.
Anyone.
Yeah.
I've been there, my friend.
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
It's not something you can teach.
It's something you're born with.
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.
Well, if you think about it Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Wait a minute.
That's not fair.
He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.
He just didn't tell me.
Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun.
So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
I have had enough of this!
I care a great deal about your daughter.
And I have treated her with nothing but respect!
So if you've got a problem with me-- Are you yelling at me?
God, no.
You know what, Daddy?
lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm going to go out with him anyway.
Really?
Well, if it doesn't matter to her it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.
What can I say?
This doesn't make me like you more.
That's okay.
I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.
Kids!
Wait.
I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is.
That's okay, Rach.
We're not liking Ross right now.
Well, I got a lot of those, too.
It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E. -That shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.
And the rabbi's beard?
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E. It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E. Wayne!
Wayne!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hi, you guys.
What's the matter?
Well, it's just one of these situations that I just hate.
You know, a massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Me, too.
Okay.
That's so generous.
And I think Ross is generous, too.
Great!
Okay.
Then it's just us girls.
-Great.
-Yeah.
So what is the exhibit?
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh, man!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hey, Ross.
Listen.
Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
Thanks?
But I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
-That's great!
-Yeah.
Think of all the money that you're gonna make!
Why?
What?
Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?
No, no.
That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.
You know, let it go.
Stop it!
Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father.
So he's much older than she is.
Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils.
Ross, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay.
Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
-Ross?
-Come on!
That's funny, you know?
'Cause he's got like a hearing aid, you know?
'Cause he's all old.
One second.
Okay, look, Ross.
So you know, since Lizzie likes you so much l've accepted the fact that you two are dating.
Really?
Okay, that's great.
Yeah.
But then I changed my mind.
I'm funny like that.
I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
All right, look.
I realize it upsets you.
Yes, it does.
But Elizabeth and I are both adults so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I'll inform the university of your relationship, and have you fired.
A man with a plan!
The One Where Paul's The Man This is so exciting.
You get your picture back up on the wall of fame.
I know.
It was so cool when it was up there before.
Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
Now he's just laughing at me.
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!
Okay.
Maybe when they put your picture back up they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
Look at him just smiling at me.
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani.
From the wall?
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.
Okay, anyway.
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.
-Show me in the TV book.
-Well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine.
I will bring you a tape.
So, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
Maybe?
Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Fine.
I love museums.
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.
What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
What?
No, why?
No reason.
That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You could put the aisle over here and have the wedding ceremony here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married.
But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.
You'd have the ceremony under this beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.
-Do you do a lot of weddings here?
-Yes, we're popular.
There's a two-year waiting list.
Sorry.
You should totally put your name down for this place.
What?
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.
There's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?
Then you've gotta wait another two years?
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
He's gonna find somebody else, you know?
Someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah.
It can't hurt to put your name down.
I mean, in two years, if you're not engaged, you just don't use it.
Well, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it, too.
Me, too!
Really?
Who would you marry?
I don't know.
I don't have anyone right now.
Oh, Pheebs.
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe, that's not-- Don't even get me started on yours.
-So, did you watch the tape of my show?
-I did.
-All right.
Let's get me back up there.
-No.
You don't go up on the wall.
-What?
But you saw the show.
-Yes.
It was very offensive to my people.
Dry cleaners?
Russians.
It showed them as terrorists and villains.
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing!
Okay, that may be true.
But in Air Force One, okay, the Russians were terrorists and evil!
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it.
You should.
It's great!
This place is really beautiful.
Yeah.
I've been coming here since I was a kid.
This used to be my grandma's.
The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes.
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
But people say that my eyes look.
Do you want to make out?
Sure.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
Yeah.
I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for you.
No.
He just really freaked me out before.
So we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Big deal.
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
Yeah.
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?
Why?
Are there like bears or something?
Protection.
Yeah.
No, yeah.
That, that I forgot.
-I'll just run to the store and get some.
-No.
I'm the guy.
I'll get it.
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
-I'll be back in 10 minutes.
-Okay.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Oh, my God!
What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!
Thank you.
It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.
If you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.
Yeah, we are.
Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
There's been a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility it is available.
This is Chandler Bing!
Yes, the groom!
No, not the groom!
It's so secluded up here.
I know.
That's why I like it here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world.
Sorry.
What's the matter, honey?
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No!
Big bear!
Big bear outside!
I think l. Actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay.
Would you get me a Diet Coke?
-Okay.
Be right back.
-Okay.
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah.
I recognized the ankles.
Hurry up.
Get out.
Here you go, honey.
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.
Ice.
I need ice.
Okay.
-Thank you.
-Be right back.
Okay.
You and your ice.
Get out!
Get out!
Go!
Come on!
No, not in there!
Not in there!
He's in there!
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!
Here you go, honey.
One Diet Coke with ice.
Thank you.
I am so happy that you're here.
-Here I am!
-Elizabeth!
Look!
Elizabeth's here!
Who were you talking to?
You guys?
How did you know we were here?
Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
What are you doing here?
Did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go in that room and do your homework?
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
That Diet Coke, I think, went straight to my head!
Hi, honey.
See you later.
Wait.
I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.
Well, next time, ask!
Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh, no.
There's been a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility it is available.
Please.
He didn't hear it!
This is Chandler Bing!
No!
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Where's the guy who decides whose pictures go up on the wall?
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!
Well, make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.
I'm an actor.
I'm trying to get my picture up there on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could get your picture up there.
Oh, really?
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.
You're the other one, right?
So, are you planning on staying the night?
No, no.
Believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible.
Good.
Not that we don't want you to stay.
Obviously, you're welcome.
How much more homework do you have?
I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve.
Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really?
Okay.
Okay, I'll go upstairs if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!
And that's where everybody's gonna be!
Just relax.
Just relax, Paul.
You're doing great.
She likes you.
I think she likes you.
She likes you.
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.
You are the man.
You are the man!
Still got it.
Still sexy.
You're just a love machine.
"I'm just a love machine "So proud of what you have, baby!
" Showtime.
"I'm just a love machine Hey, baby!
" -Phoebe?
-Yeah?
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?
The museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding.
And Chandler heard.
I know.
How bad is this?
Well, with a regular guy it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!
I know!
He totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never listening to you again, for sure.
"What harm can it do to put your name down"?
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!
Here it is!
Joey, why did you sign it, "son of a bitch"?
-I didn't do that.
Who would've done that?
-Son of a bitch!
Okay.
Maybe ask this guy.
You!
Get out of my shop!
-What did he do?
-He went out with my wife!
Joey!
I did not go out with your wife!
Okay?
I went out with her.
That's my wife!
Get out!
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.
Ross?
Elizabeth!
Okay.
I'm gonna go out this window.
I'll meet you at the front door.
Just tell them you're going home, okay?
-Okay.
-Wait, wait!
No, don't go in there!
Don't go in there!
I need another soda!
Ross!
Oh, my God!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk.
-Daddy, l-- -You're next!
Okay.
I didn't know he was here.
Let's see if I got this straight.
I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired.
What you heard was: "Take my daughter "come up to my country house and ruin my weekend with Rachel".
-Okay.
Please, Paul.
Just let me explain.
-No!
Let me explain!
Fired!
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Have me fired.
But, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different.
I mean l, too, am a "neat guy".
What?
And l, too am "just a love machine".
-Let me show you where the guest room is.
-Okay.
I'm so sorry.
Please stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.
Why would I freak out?
Hildy called and said we were getting married.
But that happens every day.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.
And I just put our names down for fun.
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.
Please don't think I was trying to pressure you.
-Phoebe and Rachel thought-- -Phoebe and Rachel?
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you Phoebe, Rachel, Hildy, and some band called, Star Light Magic Seven who are available, by the way.
It was a mistake.
Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
Really?
Yes.
If it really doesn't mean anything, because I'm just not ready.
I know.
I know.
Okay.
All right.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.
We were really worried about you.
Did she buy it?
Totally.
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah.
It's beautiful.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
I know.
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 .
And that guy over there wants some biscotti.
Well, I just actually came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
No.
I quit a long time ago.
Did I forget to tell you that?
I'm sorry.
-That's cool.
I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Can you help me pick an engagement ring?
I don't know.
Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a-- Paper cut?
!
-Have you told anyone else?
-No, I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Because I trust you, and we're friends.
.
.
.
.
.
and you saw me looking at ring brochures.
Once again, not knocking pays off.
-I wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
-Me too.
-Want to go to the coffeehouse?
-Oh, all right.
We were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Well, we don't, because we got the other place.
How rude.
Sorry.
Want a bite?
The One With The Ring Gelula/SDI So how are things going with Paul?
Good.
Although, you know, he's a private guy.
I wish I could get him to open up.
Share some feelings.
You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.
I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
That's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
-Watch this.
-Okay.
-Hey, Paul.
-Hi, Phoebe.
How are things going with you?
Can't complain.
-Hey!
-Hi.
-Great to-- -Ross, good to see you too.
You take care.
What was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
That was so weird, huh?
Why did you do it?
I didn't do it.
It was Chandler.
He's mad at you.
-What?
Why?
-Oh, please.
I think you know why.
I can't think of anything.
Come on.
You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.
Is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game?
Is that something he'd be mad at you for?
-I guess it could.
-Well, then I think that's it.
If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.
You should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table.
Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden.
Yeah, that's great.
But first, talk to me.
Talk to me.
Tell me about your day.
It was fine.
Okay.
What are you thinking right now?
That you are looking really fine in that dress.
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know.
.
.
.
I want to know what-- Wow, those are really great!
I just want to know.
.
.
.
.
.
what is behind this strong, silent exterior?
They say that still waters run deep, and I want to swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
No, Paul.
I don't know anything about you.
Tell me about your childhood.
Normal.
Then how about puberty?
Come on!
That's always a painful time.
Your pals have a slumber party and stick your hand in warm water.
.
.
.
.
.
while you sleep so you pee in your sleeping bag.
No, that never happened to me.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.
Anyway.
.
.
.
The rest of your life.
Any regrets?
No.
I'm not asking for a lot here.
Just give me something.
Anything.
-Okay.
-Okay.
When I was 6 years old, I wanted a Big Wheel.
And instead, my parents got me this little.
.
.
.
.
.
plastic chicken that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
That's great!
See?
I already feel like I know you a little better.
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Let's go!
It was horrible.
They called me "Chicken Boy.
" In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.
Richard Danville bit me on the nose.
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.
Yeah, yeah.
I see the scar.
I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.
It's really.
.
.
.
It's beautiful.
But what do you say we go share some food?
No, I couldn't eat now.
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!
Chicken?
-Chicken Boy!
-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
This is the nine millionth ring store, and I can't find the perfect ring.
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring.
.
.
.
It's a beautiful selection.
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.
An engagement bracelet.
Or an engagement tiara!
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Imagine getting down on one knee.
.
.
.
.
.
and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
I'm gonna stick with the ring.
This one's nice.
I like it.
Sir?
Kind sir, can I see this one?
This is the reason you brought me.
I know how to haggle.
Let me handle this from here.
Can I help you?
-I would like to see that ring, please.
-Or not.
Whatever.
This ring is from the 1 920s.
It's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires.
Sir, could I ask you to.
.
.
?
Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
-Okay.
-Okay.
Will you marry me?
Oh, my God, that's it!
That's the ring!
-How much is it?
-I will handle this.
How much is it?
$8600.
We will give you $1 0.
-Are you interested in this ring?
-Yes.
But I can only pay $8000.
-Okay.
I can let it go for 8.
-We stand firm at $1 0.
-How'd you like to pay?
-Credit card.
Oh, no!
I lent my credit card to Joey.
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
Do you have anything here for $1 0?
Yes.
I have these two rather beautiful.
.
.
.
.
.
five-dollar bills.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
-Remember, you were eating pizza?
-Yeah.
Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game.
We were supposed to just get him one?
That guy's always mooching off of us.
Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up.
We could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
That's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.
Here you go.
Hey, hey.
I got this one.
Here you go.
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
We do stuff all the time without you, and you don't get all upset.
-All the time?
-All the time.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
-Still crying?
-Like a little girl.
I know, I know.
This is all my fault.
I wanted him to open up.
I didn't know that I was gonna unleash.
.
.
.
.
.
this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.
One of them is sex.
-What's the other?
-Don't know.
Never had to use it.
I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
That's right.
You're the talker.
Anyway, great idea.
I gotta buy him some more tissues.
-We have some here.
-No, you don't!
Okay.
I'd also like to try on the tiara.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
What do you think?
Too much?
A tad.
Take the tiara back.
.
.
.
.
.
and let me hold the musket again.
Something's missing.
Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring?
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh, my God!
Wait, no!
Let me out!
Now!
Rachel?
No.
-How are you, Paul?
-Okay.
Chandler.
.
.
-.
.
.
did your dad ever hug you?
-No.
Did he hug you?
No!
No.
It's just that my dad never did.
I miss my dad.
You can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
-Hey, Chandler?
-Yeah?
Would you.
.
.
?
Would you hug me?
-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
-That's what my dad used to say.
Okay.
A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.
There you go.
Okay.
-Five more seconds-- -Okay!
-Joey!
-What?
Hey, what--?
Hi.
Paul, is it?
-Do you have my credit card?
-Yeah.
It's in my.
.
.
.
In my pocket.
-My back pocket!
-Thank God.
-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
-I can't go.
It'll be fun.
Me, you, Ross and.
.
.
.
Paul, probably.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh, wake up, Chandler.
The one you picked is gone.
It's over!
What?
Some guy bought it.
I tried to stop him but they put me in jail!
-They put you in jail?
-The little jail between the doors!
-I asked you to guard the ring!
-I know!
I'm sorry.
But this ring is better.
And Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah.
But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goosebumps.
-Maybe it was the guy.
-It was the ring!
-Was he excited about the tickets?
-No!
He blew us off!
-What?
-I know.
I can't believe it.
Can I tell you something?
I'm a little mad at him now!
Can I tell you something?
Me too!
He didn't want to talk to us about being angry?
Maybe we don't talk to him at all!
-Freeze him out.
-Right!
-I like it.
-We'll show him.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.
We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hi, I'm back.
I've written down more to tell you!
Oh, that's great.
No, actually, that's.
.
.
.
That's great.
That's really great.
You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me.
.
.
.
It gets me kind of hot.
Wait, wait.
Listen to this: Know what I wanted to be at that age?
A lover?
-A surfer.
-A surfer?
-I wanted to be one with the waves-- -Hold on.
Let me just get a little more comfortable here.
Wait a second.
-This isn't too revealing, is it?
-No.
Whatever happened to that little dude?
So full of dreams.
I don't care about the little dude!
I can't!
I cannot listen to any more of this!
The only one who'd listen is a mental health professional!
That's only because they get $1 00 an hour!
Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
$2000!
Know when I figured that out?
While you were talking!
I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago.
.
.
.
.
.
we figured out that that's what my mother was trying to do to me!
I'm sorry.
I don't mean.
.
.
.
I didn't mean to stifle you.
This is all just a little overwhelming.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
It's just that when those gates open.
.
.
.
.
.
it's hard to close them.
But they are closed now.
Believe me.
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad you shared.
And I'm glad that you're done.
So what do you say we.
.
.
.
I'd really like that.
That was so good!
Oh, oh.
I can't believe you talked me into this gumball-machine-looking ring.
It's not gumball machine-looking.
It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not.
When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face.
.
.
.
.
.
and see her saying yes.
When I look at this, all I see is a ring.
Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
This is the most important thing I'll ever do.
I want to make it perfect.
Maybe we could get the other ring back.
I heard where the guy was gonna propose.
Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
I can't do that.
You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is.
He hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on her finger.
Wow, you're good!
After this, we should solve crimes.
Okay.
Go get him.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you come with me?
You have a phone call.
-Who is it?
-It is your office.
-Do you know who at my office?
-John.
Oh, John!
Great!
-There he is.
-Hi.
Okay.
There was a mix-up at the store.
The ring you have was supposed to be held for me.
I'm gonna need to have that back.
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.
Wow, I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one.
Excuse me.
This is my fiancÃ©e, and her heart was set on that ring.
Do you want to break her heart?
Yeah.
Do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?
Yeah, she's dying.
.
.
.
.
.
of a cough, apparently.
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it.
.
.
.
.
.
my spirit will wander the netherworld-- That's enough, honey!
Oh, I don't know.
-Let me see it.
-Great.
Okay, here.
-All right, I'll do it.
-Thank you.
And you are about to marry a wonderful man.
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!
Guys?
I got something important to tell you.
Guys.
Guys?
Guys?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.
Wait.
Is this for real?
Yeah.
Check out the ring.
Oh, my God!
So you two are really serious?
Yeah, pretty much.
You're gonna get married?
We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Come here!
And we're gonna be friends again.
What?
-Water under the bridge!
Forget it!
-Okay.
I was gonna wait till it was official, but I had to tell you guys.
You're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Oh!
No more crying!
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!
-I know.
-Where's all the tissues?
!
Check out the ring.
Oh, nice.
One and a half carat, easy.
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.
-He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
-I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
She walked in while I was looking at brochures.
You can understand that.
Guys?
Guys?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
That is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
You should know, you bought like a billion of them.
You didn't get one.
Tonight's the big night.
How will you ask her?
It'll be perfect.
We'll go to her favorite restaurant.
I'll get her favorite champagne.
She'll know how expensive it is.
When the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast, I'll propose.
Sounds perfect!
You'll mess up.
Let me do it.
I won't mess up.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
She won't say no.
If?
Hey, Monica.
-Give it.
-It's gone.
Hey, Monica!
We're practically kissing.
The One With The Proposal - Part 1 Gelula/SDI Anyone free tonight?
My boss is hosting a charity event for kids.
And the more people I bring, the better I look.
We can't go.
We're going to dinner.
Remember?
-Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
-What's the big deal?
I get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Where are you going?
-How about you guys?
-Open bar?
-I think so.
-I can do that for the kids.
I'll come.
I'm making money.
It's time I give some back.
You could give back the money you owe me.
Okay.
Have a benefit.
Ross, can you come to a charity event tonight?
No, I have plans with Elizabeth.
You're already doing your part for the kids.
It's our last night before she leaves for camp.
To be a counselor.
I have a question.
All jokes aside.
Where is this relationship going?
All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.
-Do you see this as long-term?
-I don't know.
-You are 1 2 years older than her.
-Does everyone feel this way?
Yeah, sort of.
Thought you were making jokes.
I had no idea.
You guys are wrong.
Yes, there is a chronological age difference.
But I never notice it, because she is very mature.
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.
Not what she said last night.
See, now he could date her.
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Hey, you marry me.
What's going on, little elves?
It's the big night.
We wish you luck.
-Have the ring?
-In my pocket.
Will you guys get out of here?
This is a surprise.
Yeah, guys.
Get out of here.
Hi, guys.
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.
What's going on?
We're just really.
.
.
.
.
.
excited about this charity event we're going to.
-Here.
-Thank you.
So, what's going on here?
Well, this is a silent auction.
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.
The highest bid gets it.
I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?
Why?
No, it's nice.
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.
Someone?
I brought people.
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.
He's the head of my department.
-And I also brought my friend Joey.
-Shrimp toast!
You know, I don't know where he is.
I hope you're gonna bid.
Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
-Nice choice.
-Yeah.
-Good luck.
-Thank you.
Okay, $20.
Shut the door!
Shut the door!
What's going on?
Guys are throwing water balloons.
Call the police.
That's what I did to kids in my building.
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.
I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight.
It's excellent.
The director is the-- -Who drank all the kamikazes?
-Nobody.
We put them in here!
You want some?
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.
So this play, what do you think?
-It's gotten great reviews.
-Attack!
-Put your balloons down!
-You put your balloons down!
Everybody put their balloons down!
Now, this is a nice suit!
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris.
It goes to Emil Alexander with a high bid of $2300.
So close!
Hey, you guys, look.
Got me some drinks.
-What are you doing?
-Open bar.
Finally, our biggest item.
The 22-foot Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.
The winning bid was a whopping $20,000.
I won!
That was my guess!
What?
What?
What?
I guessed $20,000.
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess.
You buy!
What?
I don't have $20,000.
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, sit down.
Forget her.
You enjoy this.
What are you doing?
"One nation.
.
.
.
.
.
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
" I remembered it.
The champagne is here.
-Are you okay?
-Yes.
Yes.
I'm good.
Are you good?
Are you perfect?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
I'm a little cold.
Can I have your jacket?
No, you can't have my jacket.
Because then I would be cold.
If you thought you'd be cold, you should have brought a jacket.
Other than that, are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
I'm fine.
In fact, I've been fine for a long time now and I think.
.
.
.
.
.
the reason is you.
That's sweet.
Before I met you, I had really little life.
And I couldn't imagine growing old-- Oh, my God.
-I know.
But let me say it.
-Oh, my God.
Richard.
What?
I'm Chandler.
Oh, that's Richard.
Maybe he won't see us.
Richard!
Monica.
Chandler.
I don't know why I did that.
-It's good to see you.
-You too.
You let your hair grow.
Oh, that's right, you always wanted me to.
I see your mustache is back.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And you don't have a mustache, which is good.
I'm Chandler.
I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.
No one's supposed to know about us!
See, I did it again.
-Chandler, sit down.
-I'll sit down.
Good to see you.
Your table is ready, sir.
Good to see you guys.
If you prefer, this table's available.
That might be fun.
What were you thinking?
I didn't know it was an auction.
I figured I'd take a guess.
Help a charity.
Free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?
I don't know.
Charity?
Well, just buy the damn boat.
Don't you think you've had enough to drink?
I'm just helping the kids.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your contribution brings us.
.
.
.
.
.
a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 1 9,000.
Hey, I was pretty close.
So, bad news.
I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.
Joey!
Joey, good one!
Good!
Very good!
-So I think I'm gonna take off now.
-You can't leave, Joey!
You agreed to buy that boat.
It is a contract.
Plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me.
I don't have that kind of money.
I know.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is what we'll do.
We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.
Then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Okay.
I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.
They should just watch TV after school like I did.
And I turned out fine.
Not great.
So we're hiding in the bathroom.
.
.
.
Then I sneak out.
But before Monica can, her parents come in.
I hid in the shower, next thing you know.
.
.
.
.
.
they're going at it on the floor.
Oh, my God!
I got a good one.
I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.
As a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship.
.
.
.
.
.
Iet there be laughter and sharing of pleasures.
.
.
.
.
.
for in the dew of little things.
.
.
.
.
.
the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.
" What?
Oh, my God!
You guys!
Have we got a story for you.
Guess who we bumped into?
-Who?
-Richard!
I thought you were going out.
I was.
She was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.
Maybe she is too young for me.
When I was over there, I felt like I was a babysitter.
I finally see what you were talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad.
That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff.
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm 1 2 years older than she is.
If school finds out, you're fired.
-She's leaving for three months.
-For camp.
Okay, good stuff.
Well, she's sweet and pretty and.
.
.
.
The only question you need to ask is, do you see a future?
Do you see yourself marrying her?
My God.
You married her, didn't you?
No, I didn't do that.
It's just.
.
.
.
Honestly, no, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay, I think that's your answer.
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful.
.
.
.
.
.
you may not get married at all this year.
-Next highest bidder is at table one.
-Great.
The guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
-You care about the guy who won?
-It's a trip for two.
Excuse me.
Is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
-That was me.
-EnchantÃ©.
-Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
-That's me.
Hello.
This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
The Gentleman Daysailer has become available again.
I believe you made a bid of $1 8,000?
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.
I was actually relieved I didn't win the boat.
My wife would've killed me.
Are you kidding?
She'll love this boat!
-What is your wife's name?
-It's Pam.
It's Pam.
Just imagine this.
The Pam.
I don't think she'd like that.
Imagine this: The Mr. Bowmont.
I don't think so.
Let me paint you a little picture.
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your arms.
You get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted.
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.
You get one of those hats, people call you captain.
And then when you're old, Cappy.
It's for a good cause.
All right!
-No way!
It's mine!
-What?
The stuff you said, I want that!
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!
Who cares?
I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!
You're back!
Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in your hand, the trash.
It's all dirty.
You should throw this out.
-What did you just do?
-What happened?
-Richard was there.
I couldn't do it.
-Oh, no.
I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.
Now you've ruined it.
We didn't.
You walk in here and ask to see her hand!
A palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor.
-Glove salesman.
-Good one!
This is terrible.
What am I gonna do?
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.
I'll make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Convince her you're scared of commitment.
I can do that.
I've had 30 years of practice.
Being you is finally gonna pay off!
Had to go to the basement.
.
.
.
.
.
some idiot keeps stuffing the chute with pizza boxes.
That guy's still doing that?
My God, let me see your hand!
No, you're too late!
She already took out the trash!
I have never had such a healthy breakup.
She was such a grownup about it.
She didn 't seem too immature for me.
Did ljust make a huge mistake?
Ross?
Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about-- You suck!
What?
Breakup's still on.
Here she comes.
Do I look like I don't want to get married?
And, also, a little like a French guy.
I never noticed that before.
What are you up to?
Just hanging out.
Talking about web sites.
We saw this interesting web site about marriage.
How unnecessary it is.
How it's a way for governments to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
That's a little crazy.
Although I am glad you're looking at other things on the lnternet.
Got me thinking, why would anybody want to get married?
To celebrate the relationship.
To solidify the commitment.
To declare your love for one another to the world.
Well, that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?
Sure!
I love this part!
-Come on in.
-Hi.
I'm not here to compliment the chef.
I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.
Like I've nothing better to do.
What's up?
It was great seeing you the other night.
Good to see you too.
Came to tell me that?
No.
Came here to tell you something else.
Came here to tell you I still love you.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
What?
What did you-- What?
I still love you.
I know I shouldn't even be here telling you this.
You're with Chandler, who I really like.
You say he's straight, I'll believe you.
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't tell you I'd always regret it.
Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
You're really not supposed to be back here.
I'm sorry.
I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place.
.
.
.
.
.
but I had to tell you.
I want to spend my life with you and marry you.
I want to have kids with you.
Why don't they put chairs back here?
I know this is crazy, but am I too late?
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?
I know.
I was an idiot.
And I tried to forget you.
I really did.
After we had lunch last year, I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.
-What were you doing in Africa?
-Working with blind kids.
What are you doing to me?
Look, l. .
.
.
I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.
That's fine.
I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.
Only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well, he is.
I mean.
.
.
.
.
.
marriage is all he talks about.
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.
You are?
Why?
Why?
Because of the government.
The One With The Proposal - Part 2 Gelula/SDI Isn't it incredible?
Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I know.
They'll be so happy together.
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?
-Not that often.
-No.
I'm so happy for them.
Me too.
So happy for them.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh, no!
God, definitely not jealous.
I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous.
What's 2%?
That's nothing.
Totally.
-I'm like 90-1 0.
-Yeah.
Me too.
Have you guys seen Chandler?
No.
But you know who was looking for you?
Tenille.
So that marriage stuff you were saying yesterday?
-You don't really believe that.
-Sure, I do.
In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural.
Look at pigs.
Let's take a second here and look at pigs.
Pigs don't mate for life.
A pig can have 1 00 sexual partners in a lifetime.
And that's just an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me you may never want to get married?
Never say never, but, probably.
.
.
.
.
.
yeah, never.
Oh, my God.
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?
Is this some new strategy?
Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, man-trap?
You know what?
I gotta go.
It's okay.
I got a plan.
-We're gonna find love.
-Definitely.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.
That's what makes it so easy to be -Would be nice to have a guarantee.
-What do you mean?
Some people make deals with a friend.
Like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other.
-You mean a backup?
-Exactly.
I've got that.
You do?
-Who?
-Joey?
Joey?
Are you serious?
I locked him in years ago.
Wait.
So if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry Joey?
Yep.
We shook on it.
But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Seriously?
I think his exact words were.
.
.
.
Charming.
He's just a backup.
Hey, Monica.
Have you seen Rachel?
Or a mirror?
It's for my boat.
Cool, huh?
Yeah, it's great.
What's the matter?
Talk to the captain.
Just realizing I'm in a dead-end relationship.
He's giving you a hard time?
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe.
.
.
.
.
.
we're going somewhere, that I'm not wasting my time.
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.
Maybe you changed.
I didn't change.
Maybe that's the problem.
-What?
-Chandler is a complex fellow.
One who is unlikely to take a wife.
Does he think I'll just wait around for nothing?
Face it.
Chandler is against marriage.
And always will be.
Well, there's some people who do want to marry me.
-There are?
-Yeah.
Richard.
Richard said he wants to marry you?
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!
You just told me he hates marriage!
That he's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife!
That he's against marriage and always will be!
You got that from what I said?
-Rach.
-Hey, you.
-Come on in.
-Thank you.
I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Thanks.
Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work.
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Yeah.
Love.
It's a tricky business, isn't it?
I guess so.
So what do you say we make a pact?
If you and I are both single by 40, we get married.
I mean, we know each other, we like each other.
.
.
.
.
.
we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises there.
No, like, "What's that"?
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Exactly.
Yeah.
I already have one.
-Who?
-Phoebe.
Phoebe?
But she just said Joey is her backup.
Oh, I don't think so.
I just spoke with her.
She said that she and Joey made a deal.
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.
We shook on it.
Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where have you been?
I was making a coconut phone with the Professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her.
-What?
-I've been looking for you.
Stop messing with her!
And I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
-Oh, my God!
-I know!
They suck!
He's not supposed to ask her to marry him!
I am!
-I know!
-What--?
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!
Will you help me?
Look, us getting our asses kicked is not a solution.
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.
I'm gonna get the ring.
.
.
.
.
.
I'll go find her.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'll propose!
Dude!
Dude!
Dude!
That coconut phone might be good for the boat.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't know why I'm here.
I didn't ask.
You want to come in?
I don't know.
Oh, okay.
I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Drink?
-Scotch on the-- -Rocks with a twist?
I remember.
You still smoking cigars?
No.
That's art.
If it bothers you, I can put my art out.
No, that's okay.
So, Monica.
.
.
.
.
.
Iet me ask you a question.
Since we broke up, do you ever.
.
.
.
.
.
think about me?
Actually, I thought about you a couple months ago.
-Really?
-Yeah, but it's because l. .
.
.
.
.
had an eye exam, and I don't like my new eye doctor.
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.
Yeah, he's no good.
Do you ever think about me in.
.
.
.
.
.
a non-eye-doctor way?
No.
Because getting over you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I never let myself think about you.
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?
You can't have two backups!
Of course I can.
It's just good sense to back up your backup.
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?
Hey, Phoebe!
We're both backups?
How could you do this to me?
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.
-I was not!
-No, we weren't!
This kind of back talk isn't gonna fly when we're married.
You can't have both.
Pick one.
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!
I don't want to end up an old maid.
Well, let's see.
Ross is a good father.
But.
.
.
.
.
.
Joey has a boat.
This is hard.
This is crazy.
I want to switch to Rachel.
I want to switch too.
No, wait!
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.
Remember my promise: If we get married, three times a week.
Oh, my God.
Phoebe.
.
.
.
I'm talking about massages.
No, I'm not.
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.
I'll write "Joey" .
.
.
.
.
.
on one napkin.
And I'm going to write "Ross" on the other napkin.
.
.
.
.
.
and we'll pick one.
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.
-That sounds fair.
-All right.
Good.
Switching them up.
-Pick one.
-Left.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Ross.
-Joey.
-We should just switch.
-Absolutely.
I miss this apartment.
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.
I should be with a grownup, you know?
You're saying you need to be with someone more mature.
Maybe someone with.
.
.
.
.
.
a license to practice medicine.
Or a mustache.
Let's face it.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I need to be with someone who wants the same things.
Coming to my work and telling me you love me, I want that!
Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
Fair?
Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.
Fair would've been you wanting to marry me then.
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.
Believe me, nothing about this is fair.
Nothing.
-Nothing!
Nothing!
-It's okay.
Nothing.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I know.
I have to figure.
.
.
.
.
.
some stuff, before I can.
.
.
.
I understand.
Take as much time as you want.
I'll be here.
Not smoking.
Where is she?
I'm not scared of you.
She's not here.
And please come in.
Scotch on the rocks.
.
.
.
.
.
with a twist, on a coaster.
Monica?
Okay, she was here.
But she left.
Where did she go?
She said she had to think things over.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.
Look, nothing happened.
Nothing happened?
Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?
Well, all right, one thing happened.
You know what you did?
My girlfriend is thinking things over.
You made my girlfriend think!
Well, I'm sorry.
What's to think about?
I love her.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.
To throw her off so when I offered all these things, she'd be surprised.
If it helps, it worked very well.
It was working till you showed up, you big tree.
This isn't fair.
You had your chance with her, and you blew it!
This is my chance and I won't blow it.
.
.
.
.
.
because we are meant for each other.
And this has all just been one stupid mistake!
I was gonna propose tonight.
You were?
Yeah, I even.
.
.
.
.
.
got a ring.
Did you get a ring?
No, I don't have a ring.
You go get her.
And can I give you a piece of advice?
If you do get her.
.
.
.
.
.
don't let her go.
Trust me.
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.
I know.
I hate that.
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.
-What?
-She was crying.
She said you want different things and she needs to think.
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?
I did!
I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.
Where did she go?
To her parents.
She said you shouldn't call.
But if I were you, I would.
Can't believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry, man.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh, my God.
Chandler.
.
.
.
.
.
in all my life.
.
.
.
.
.
I never thought I would be so lucky.
.
.
.
.
.
as to fall in love with my best.
.
.
.
.
.
my best.
.
.
.
There's a reason why girls don't do this!
I'll do it.
I thought.
.
.
.
Wait, I can do this.
I thought that it mattered.
.
.
.
.
.
what I said or where I said it.
Then I realized.
.
.
.
.
.
the only thing that matters is that you.
.
.
.
.
.
you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
And if you let me.
.
.
.
.
.
I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.
Monica.
.
.
.
.
.
will you marry me?
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!
Come in!
Come in!
We're engaged!
This is the least jealous I've ever been!
Oh, no, wait!
This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!
He's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!
