{START OF EPISODE 1}
Niles, what are you doing?
This fruit-nut muffin contains a number of things I don't care for.
Currants, a husk of something Away, wrinkly thing.
You know, if you and Maris ever reconcile, I'm going to miss these tranquil mornings.
I reading my newspaper, you tweezing your muffin.
- Hey, boys.
Hello, Dad.
Hey, I got a letter from my old Army pal, Bud Farrell.
The whole platoon's getting together next weekend in Rattlesnake Ridge.
Good for you.
Speaking of old chums, Daphne, a Clive called for you a little earlier.
Clive?
Did he sound British?
No, he was one of those fiery Mexican Clives.
- He said he'd call back.
Yeah, I'll bet he will.
Oh, boy, I can't wait to see the old gang.
Dad, you're not thinking of driving all the way to Rattlesnake Ridge?
It's five hours away.
Your hip stiffens up.
No problem.
They said I can bring a guest.
So who's the lucky one?
Well, by my count, two of us get to be lucky.
Come on, they're great guys.
Stinky, Wolfman, Boom-Boom, Jim.
Of course, his name's not really Jim.
We call him that because he likes to drink Jim Beam.
Just like we call Hank "Bud" because he drinks Budweiser.
Come on, you'd love these guys.
We're sherry drinkers, Dad.
Think about it.
Anyway, I have a conference that weekend.
Yeah, and I have me friend Megan's birthday party.
Fras?
Oh, please let that be Megan needing a clown for her party.
Hello?
Oh, Clive.
Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?
Oh, I am sorry.
I have dinner plans tonight.
Well, maybe just a drink, then.
Say 6:30?
Me too.
Bye.
Oh, hell.
So who is this Clive?
- An ex -boyfriend?
Worse.
Ex-fiancë.
You were engaged?
For years.
Oh, we were mad for each other.
He was very sweet and had the most gorgeous eyes you ever saw.
- But?
- Oh, yes, that too.
I just couldn't see a future with him.
I mean, the man was a total layabout.
No ambition, no drive.
He couldn't hold a job.
All he wanted to do was tinker about with his car.
His hands were always black from the motor oil.
What a brutish habit.
If God had intended me to work on my Mercedes, he wouldn't have given me Horst.
I had to break it off.
But I wanted to let him down easily, so I said if we were still free in five years, we could try again.
And here he is, right on schedule.
What do I say to him?
Be honest.
Tell him how you feel.
What, to break the poor thing's heart again?
In the long run, honesty's the best way to avoid unnecessary anguish.
Well, case in point.
Dad, I do not have plans for next weekend, but I do not intend to spend it in the middle of nowhere with Budweiser and Boilermaker and their liver-damaged friend, Seltzer.
Well, that's fine.
There will be other reunions.
There, you see?
No evasions, no convenient conferences, just simple honesty.
Course, I don't suppose Jim'll make it next time.
Says here he just had his third bypass.
- But I guess I'll see him at his funeral.
- Off to work.
Unless I go first!
All right!
I'll drive you to your stupid reunion.
Thanks, son.
I guess I better wait a few days to tell him about Stinky needing a ride.
And in closing, this goes out to Keith, the narcoleptic I spoke to earlier.
I'd be glad to resume our conversation when you feel a bit more alert.
But in the meantime, I suggest that you reconsider applying for that air-traffic-control position.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 AM.
Brilliant show, Frasier.
Chock-full of pithy insight.
- What do you want?
A favour.
Bonnie Weems, the Auto Lady, just asked me to another one of her wretched dinner parties.
I'm planning on saying that you and I have ballet tickets that night, - so do back me up.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
No, you've got to.
Have you any idea how vile her food is?
The local raccoons have posted warning signs on her trash bin.
Yes, you see, she already invited me, and I told her I was driving my father to his Army reunion at Rattlesnake Ridge.
Oh, very clever.
Well, I'd use it myself, only I killed my father off to escape her Labor Day clambake.
Oh, Roz.
Listen, I'm going to the opera tomorrow night.
- You didn't happen to remember my?
- Oh, your opera glasses.
I'm so sorry.
They completely slipped my mind.
I wouldn't mind if you hadn't borrowed them to ogle that bodybuilder across the street.
I've looked once or twice.
It's not like I copied his name off his mailbox so I could look up his number and call him while he's in the shower so I could watch him cross the room naked to answer the phone.
That would be wrong.
I want them back.
I refuse to squint through Pagliacci while you're trying to watch The Magic Flute.
Dr Crane, I need your opinion on this outfit.
I wanted something that sent no romantic signals whatsoever.
Well, short of a cactus corsage, I think you've captured it.
You know, Daphne, it's been five years.
That's an awfully long time to carry a torch.
- Maybe he just wants to say hello.
- Oh, I certainly hope so.
The thought of having to reject the poor thing again is more than I can bear.
Oh, dear.
It's him.
- Anything between me teeth?
- No.
Do we have any spinach in the fridge?
Just answer the door.
Oh, Dr Crane.
I was afraid you were Clive.
Clive?
Oh, Clive.
Oh, was that tonight?
Oh, well, don't I feel silly bringing over this thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle.
Niles, I'm sure that Daphne doesn't want us horning in on her reunion.
- We're going to dinner.
- Well, can we order in?
I've already assembled one kitten and two yarn balls.
I'm getting my jacket.
Niles, for God's sake, will you give them some privacy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Look at you.
You look wonderful.
- Oh, go on!
- No, no, I mean it.
Very pretty and warm.
So So - Oh, God.
- What?
I've gotten a spot of axle grease on your sweater.
Oh, no, it's all right, really.
It's just a ratty old thing.
Please, come in.
- Same old Clive, I see.
- I suppose so.
So, what brings you to Seattle?
My undying love for you.
Oh, damn!
I meant to lead up to that.
Sorry.
- No, it's all right.
Just a bit - Abrupt.
No "how are you," no "nice place you have here".
By the way, it is lovely.
Is that the Space Needle?
- Clive.
- Big.
Anyway, I remembered what you told me five years ago, and I thought my feelings might change.
- Five years is a long time, but - Oh, Clive.
No, no, let me finish.
My feelings for you haven't changed.
I think about you every day, every night.
And there comes a time in every man's life when he's gotta summon the courage to look a woman in the eye and say  Cheese Nips?
I'm sorry.
Is this a bad moment?
- Well, actually, I was - No, no, not at all.
Well, this is my very dear old friend, Clive Roddy.
Clive, I'd like you to meet Dr Niles Crane my husband.
- Your husband?
- Oh, yes.
Six months next week.
Well, congratulations.
You're a very lucky man.
Six months?
You two are practically newlyweds.
Yes, we're still at that honeymoon stage.
It's sickening, really.
Revolting.
- Positively stomach-turning.
- Darling!
- Well, I should be going.
No!
I mean we're so enjoying having you here.
I did promise you a drink.
Oh, well, I suppose I could stay for a beer.
Oh, good.
Darling, would you give me a hand in the kitchen, please?
Certainly, my angel.
Dr Crane, I'm so sorry.
It seemed the kindest way to let him down.
I didn't mean to put you in such an awkward position.
When it comes to you, no position is too awkward.
Oh, hello.
You must be Clive.
- Yeah.
And you're?
- Dr Frasier Crane.
Oh, Niles' brother.
- Yes.
You've met Niles?
- Just now.
Though I used to know his wife quite well.
Really, you know his wife?
- She's one of a kind, that one.
- Isn't she?
Certainly can light up a room.
Oh, yes.
Usually by leaving it.
- Frasier!
Clive!
I see you've met my husband's brother.
Yeah.
I'm not intruding on some family occasion, am I?
Oh, no, not at all.
Frasier lives here.
I mean, temporarily.
- You see, he's - He's had a spat with his wife.
Maris.
Sorry to hear that.
Yes, me too.
You know, Daphne, I'm parched.
Could you show me again where we keep the wine?
Of course.
Could you spare me a minute?
Oh, wait.
You have to pay the love toll.
Too much.
Here's your change.
Can you stay for dinner?
I told you to be honest, but did you listen?
No.
No, instead, you subject us to this charade.
Just play along, please.
I swear, one drink and he's out the door.
- He's staying for dinner.
- What?
- Well, how did that happen?
- He just sort of invited himself.
Pretty damn cheeky, if you ask me.
Dear God.
Obviously he has hopes of winning you back.
We must keep these displays of affection as realistic as possible.
What will I serve?
Do we still have that lasagne?
You don't expect me to endure an entire evening of this nonsense.
Just do this for me, and anything you want, name anything, it's yours.
Anything?
Except Rattlesnake Ridge.
- Oh, Clive?
- All right, I'll take him.
- Lasagne all right for dinner?
- Super.
I'm warning you, one thing goes wrong and the whole deal's off.
Oh, it can't go wrong.
We just have to stick to our stories and avoid unnecessary complications.
Well, I see we got company!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Clive, I'd like you to meet my new husband's father.
Or as we sometimes say in this country, father-in-law.
- I'm Clive Roddy.
- Yeah, hi, Marty Crane.
Somebody tell me what's Daphne, we've been so remiss.
We haven't even given Clive the tour.
Oh, yes, quite right.
Well, this is the living room.
Well, I think he'd be more interested in the master bathroom.
The shower being so large, and Manchester being so rainy.
Right this way.
- There you go.
- Oh, you forgot to pay the toll.
Niles!
Never mind.
- All right, now go away.
- What for?
What the hell's going on here?
Clive is Daphne's old boyfriend.
She's letting him down easily by pretending to be married to Niles.
So this is my place.
Frasier is staying here temporarily because he's separated from Maris.
You couldn't stand her either, huh?
That's very amusing.
- Do I still live here?
- Yes, of course you do.
For this evening, it might be best if you excused yourself.
You see, it requires quick thinking, improvisational skills - and a knack for remembering details.
- Well, never used any of those skills as an undercover cop.
- Please, Dad, don't be offended.
- I'm not offended.
No.
My two sons have just said I have oatmeal for brains.
So Daphne tells me you're both psychiatrists.
- Yes.
Fascinating.
- You a psychiatrist as well, Marty?
- Oh, me?
No, no, I'm retired.
And what did you do?
I was an astronaut.
Were you?
- You actually flew space missions?
- Yeah, a few.
Me and Neil Armstrong.
Buzz Aldrin.
Yeah, I was the one who gave him his nickname Buzz, you know.
Yeah, most people think it's because he flew fast.
Not true.
He was scared of bees.
Who is it?
Open up, Frasier, it's me.
What do you know, it's Maris!
Here are your stupid opera glasses.
Are we friends again?
Darling!
You're Maris.
- What?
We're married.
- What?
Play along.
Well, their little tiff's over.
Maris Crane, this is Mr Clive Roddy.
- It's a pleasure.
- It certainly is.
- So how long will you be in Seattle?
- Oh, Cupcake.
If you'd excuse us, we could use a moment alone.
Just come with me, darling.
So now you've met the whole Crane clan.
Although, Daphne, I noticed in the phone book you're still listed as Moon.
That must be an old book.
Now she hyphenates.
It's Moon-Crane.
I remember the first time I ever drove a moon crane.
Damn near rolled it into the Sea of Tranquillity.
So, Clive, what do you do?
Still mucking about with cars, I see.
Oh, me hands?
No, I helped a lady change a tire on the way over here.
Don't have as much time for cars as I used to, what with my business and all.
- Your business?
- Yeah.
After you left, I remembered the advice you used to give me, and I decided some of it made sense.
- What advice?
Well, you know "Get a job, you lazy git," that sort of thing.
So I took a few business courses and opened up a little sporting-goods shop.
Next thing you know, I had three of them.
Well, isn't this ironic.
All these years, I nagged him to make something of himself.
And now look at him: A captain of industry and still as handsome as ever.
Yes, well, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.
Well, bad news.
It seems my Maris has to run off.
She's got a previous engagement.
Oh, forget about your engagement, Maris.
Stay for dinner.
- Actually - I'd love to!
Lovely.
We can celebrate you two being reconciled.
That is still tentative.
It could go either way.
Hello there.
What's his name?
Eddie!
So there I was, floating when some idiot turns off the weightless button and down I come, right on this big pickaxe we used for moon rocks.
And you still walk with a cane?
Que será será.
Well, I'd better turn in, boys.
Don't forget your warm glass of Tang.
It was an honour meeting you, commander.
Yeah, I had fun too.
- Well, good night, all.
Good night, Dad.
Delicious meal, Daphne.
Can't remember the last time I ate so much.
Well, that explains your fantastic physique.
Yes, you are looking wonderfully firm.
You used to have that little tummy.
- Do you work out?
- Yeah, when I can.
Actually, my shops keep me pretty busy.
Daphne and I have our own little exercise regimen.
We work up quite a sweat, don't we, darling?
I can't get over it.
It's like you're a whole different person.
A whole different person.
Well, who's for coffee?
I'll give you a hand.
Would you please tell Roz to stop flirting?
Has she forgotten she's a married woman?
Oh, you're one to talk.
If you batted your eyelashes any harder, you'd blow out the candles.
You get rid of her now, or it's Rattlesnake Ridge for you.
- You wouldn't!
- Oh, wouldn't I?
And by the way, Stinky needs a ride.
And according to your love line Oh, my, what a naughty little Maris, darling, I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.
- You know - See you at home.
More wine, please.
Oh, are you sure that's wise, dear?
Remember that blackout you had last month?
What am I saying?
Of course you don't.
That's what I love about her, her sense of humour.
- Cookie, darling?
- Oh, no, thank you.
Some of us do look after our weight.
Now, now, Daphne, you have to keep your strength up.
You are eating for two.
You're having a baby?
Well, when were you planning on springing that news?
We don't like to bring that up.
It's a sore point around here, what with my sister-in-law being barren and all.
Now, now, it's not her fault.
You see, my brother is impotent.
Well, congratulations.
Is there a loo I could?
Yes, yes, right there by the front door.
We call that Frasier's bathroom.
That's why we've monogrammed all the towels with his initials.
Have you all taken leave of your senses?
She started it!
Hanging all over him.
What is your problem?
Frasier said the only reason we're doing this was because you wanted to give him the brush-off.
Well, I changed me mind.
Didn't you see my signals?
Gee, I must have missed them.
It must have been during one of my blackouts!
Wait, wait, wait.
There's no need to fight.
Look, I'll flip a coin.
- Oh, good news, Roz.
- Oh, sod off!
You'd think, with all your dozens and dozens of men, you could at least leave one for me.
Dozens?
Did you tell her that?
Well, forgive me for keeping track.
Why are you fighting over the man anyway?
He's got all the charm of a cricket bat.
You're right.
You know what, Daphne, you want him, you can have him.
- You can have him, he's yours!
- Oh, yes.
Fat chance I've got, now that you've told him I'm pregnant.
How am I supposed to get rid of this bloody baby?
Clive.
Coffee?
No, thank you.
I really should be going.
No!
No, please.
I know what you must think, but we're not what we seem.
You certainly aren't.
Look, I know I'm a guest here, so I've kept silent so far, but I'm sorry, I must speak.
You're the most appalling family I've ever met.
You, breaking up with your wife over a pair of opera glasses.
And you, looking down your nose at me the entire time you're showing off your posh flat.
Well, for your information, mate, I don't think there's anything remotely special about your bathrooms.
And you two women, flirting shamelessly with me right in front of your husbands.
You, having just reconciled with Frasier, and you, carrying Niles' baby.
Well, I pity your child, Daphne.
And I pity any good Manchester girl that comes to this vile, coffee-swilling Sodom and lets it change her like it's changed you.
But I haven't changed.
Really.
We're not the awful people you think we are.
No!
The truth is we've been lying to you all night.
Yes!
Well, I don't care to be lied to anymore.
Goodbye, Daphne, Maris, Dr Crane, Dr Crane.
I'll never understand how two men like you could've been spawned by that sweet, courageous old astronaut.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Baby, baby, all I'm saying is we should cool it for a while.
No, what's that thing?
"If you love something, let it go.
If it comes back to you" Yadda yadda yadda.
Yeah, that's it.
Hey, don't get me wrong, I'm really broken up about this.
Hey, think fast.
Come on, now No tears.
No I'll never forget you either, Sandy.
Linda?
Really?
Well, I thought I was talking to your sister.
Oh, well, tell her same goes.
- Hey, Frasier, do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course, Roz.
What is it?
Well, you're not gonna like this idea.
You're gonna complain and make up excuses and then say no anyway.
That's the very words I would use to woo my dear Lilith.
Okay, here goes.
I have this friend and I think you two would really hit it off.
You were wondering if I might meet her for a drink, which might lead to dinner, and after that, who knows where?
Yes, exactly.
Oh, listen, Roz, did you hear that?
What?
If you listen very carefully you can actually hear my skin crawling.
I know, blind dates stink.
But I'm your friend, - and I'm worried about you.
- Well, Roz When was the last time you were with a woman?
- Seems like almost a year.
- Oh, it has not been that long.
I mean, that is a laugh.
The last time was Well, let me see, the Well, the tree was still up.
Oh, God.
Her name is Sharon.
She's 5'7".
- Oh, Roz, I'm not interested.
- But she's an incredible person.
She's smart, she's funny.
She's a former pro golfer.
- She just hasn't met the right guy.
- A woman golfer?
Are we quite certain there is a right guy?
- She dates men.
- Not this one.
She plays chess.
She loves your show.
I know this isn't supposed to matter to people like you, but I've seen her in the shower at the gym, she has a body that makes Bo Derek look like Bo Diddley.
A chess player, did you say?
Look at these pants.
Oh, dear, Mr. Crane.
Did Eddie drag you through the puddles again?
Every last one of them.
Eddie, get in here.
Eddie, I mean now.
What am I gonna do with you?
My favourite shoes are soaked.
Eddie, look at me when I'm talking to you.
- You're doing it again.
- What?
You're acting like one of those nutjobs in the park - who treat their pets like children.
- Yeah?
Well, when you do it outside, you're a nut.
When you do it inside, it's your own damn business.
Eddie, go to your room.
Oh, don't worry about your shoes.
I'll get them all dried out for you.
Well, I hope.
They're not just any shoes, you know.
These are Muckabees, the most comfortable shoes made.
Air-cushioned insoles, deep flannel lining.
You know, I remember one anniversary I surprised Hester with a pair of Lady Muckabees.
Don't remember which anniversary, but I know it ended with a zero.
I don't doubt that.
Oh, all right.
I forgive you.
I love you too.
Yeah.
You'll always be my very best boy.
You know, Dad, there are some fathers who actually praise their sons and whistle at their dogs.
- New suit, huh?
Who's the lucky girl?
- If you must know, I'm meeting a friend of Roz's today after work, but it's no big deal.
Well, congratulations.
What's it been, a year?
It has not been that long.
I remember the tree was still up.
Well, look at you, all got up like a dog's dinner.
Yes, it's a new suit.
Yes, I'm meeting a woman.
And, yes, it has been a while.
Thanks.
That reminds me, I have to order me cards.
Daphne, are you finished here with the microwave?
Oh, no.
- My Muckabees!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to leave them in there for so long.
Yes, well, English cooking strikes again.
You should be happy your patient feels healthy enough to terminate therapy.
I would, but it's happened so often lately I find myself in financial straits.
Deep financial straits.
Look at this belt.
Spanish leather.
If Mr. Blackwell comes in, I'll create a diversion, you can make a dash for it.
Obviously the time has come for me to expand my practice, so I'm placing an ad in Seattle Style magazine.
Advertisement?
Isn't that a bit commercial for a psychiatrist?
Said Dr Pot to Dr Kettle.
Besides, a highly respected obstetrician on my floor did it, and now his waiting room has more swollen bellies than a Buddhist temple.
- Good one, yes.
- I liked it.
Here.
I'm on my way to call it in, I just wanted to run it by you.
All right.
"Dr Niles Crane, Jung specialist.
Servicing individuals, couples, groups.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Tell me where it hurts".
Well, that's just excellent, Niles.
All you're missing now is a very tasteful cartoon of you smiling brightly and holding a shrunken head.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was too distracted by your face going by on the side of a bus.
I'm off.
- Hey, wild thing.
- Yes, hello.
- Look, we have on the same belt.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.
- Sharon's gonna be here any minute.
- You didn't say anything, did you?
Not a word.
She has no idea this is a set-up.
Good.
Now, listen, if I don't like her, I will simply excuse myself and leave.
But if like her, I will find some polite and discreet way of indicating that you may go.
Beat it, Roz.
Hi, Sharon.
- Hi, Roz.
Look who I ran into, my boss, Dr Frasier Crane.
- Hello.
- This is Sharon Payton.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a big fan of your show.
- Thank you.
- I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.
- You probably get it all the time.
- Oh, well, not lately.
Listen, Sharon, I'm so sorry to do this, but I just got a call from the office, - and it's urgent and I have to go.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.
Well, you know, as long as you're here, you might as well join me.
That'd be nice.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye, Roz.
You know, I really do love listening to your show.
I think it's because you have such a soothing voice.
What a very kind thing to say.
I almost called in once.
Really?
May I ask what the problem was?
Well, I'm terribly competitive, which is great for sports, I used to play pro golf, but sometimes it seeps into my personal life.
Well, I don't really think that's too great a problem, but if I were to make a recommendation, it might be to start seeing a therapist.
Whoa.
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, Bulldog.
Not you.
Hey, aren't you gonna introduce me?
- Well, actually, I wasn't, no.
- Bob Brisco.
- Sharon Payton.
- Yes, good to see you.
- Don't be a stranger.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Sharon Payton.
I know you.
LPGA, you won the Denver Open, 1992.
particular Chambertin I took a shine to I know you too.
You're that guy that said golf is not a sport.
- Well, it's not.
- Really?
Yeah.
No cheerleaders, no blood, the only cups involved are in the ground.
This reminds me of a debate I had with my brother Niles about whether or not Stephen Sondheim is really light opera.
You know, I have a theory that people who put down golf do so because they can't play well.
- Is that a challenge?
- It might be.
If we leave now, we could get in nine holes.
- Loser buys dinner.
- I got a nine handicap.
You're on.
Frasier, would you like to join us?
- Well, no, I don't play.
- Well, it was really nice meeting you.
- Likewise.
- I'll get my coat.
Bulldog.
Listen, Roz set this up that I might meet Sharon.
Things were going in a very positive direction.
Yeah, well, things seem to have changed, haven't they?
- What do you call that?
Irony?
- Is there nothing I can do - to appeal to your sense of decency?
- Hey, I have no sense of decency.
That way, my other senses are enhanced.
But the real secret of Muckabees is that they mould themselves to the shape of your foot.
Now, my problem was always hammertoes.
If you had hammertoes, you'd have a hell of a time finding shoes.
But Muckabees fit over my hammertoes like a glove.
Funny, you know, when you're young, you dream about fame and fortune.
When you get to be my age, all you really want out of life is a comfy pair of shoes.
Right now I'd settle for never hearing the word "hammertoes" again.
Hey, don't give me any attitude.
Wasn't me that nuked the Muckabees.
I'm not the one who can't remember where the store is - where you bought the damn shoes.
- Just drive.
I'll tell you when to stop.
Stop!
- Is that it?
- It's a red light.
- In this country, we stop for those.
- All right, all right.
- Woman driver.
- Hammertoes.
Frasier.
What?
Haven't you spoken with Sharon?
I tried, but she wasn't home all weekend.
Frasier.
Look, before you snap my behind with a wet towel, the last time I saw Sharon was leaving Cafë Nervosa with Bulldog.
Frasier!
How could you let that happen?
Well, I don't know.
The whole thing is sort of a blur.
We were talking about golf and something called a handicap, the next thing I know, I'm sitting with a cappuccino, muttering to myself in a very soothing voice.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right, Roz.
It's just the whole thing just catapulted me back to high school.
You've only known me as an adult, but back then I was rather - an unathletic, bookish sort.
- Get out.
Jocks were the bane of my existence.
They called me a weenie, and they would steal all the girls that I wanted.
Oh, Frasier, you must have had some girlfriends.
Friends, yeah.
Yeah, any time they wanted a sensitive shoulder to cry on, but some blockheaded pillar of testosterone would come and it was: "Bye, Fras, maybe we can study later".
Then I'd head home to Niles and we'd put on the Brandenburg Concertos and play air violin.
Gee, what a couple of nerdlingers.
Oh, and I suppose you were Miss Popular in high school.
- I would say yes.
- I'm guessing that explains why too.
Hey, guys.
- What a weekend.
- Listen, Bulldog, Sharon is my friend, - and you better not hurt her.
- What?
Hurt her?
I am crazy about her.
I never felt this way before.
You know, on my way to work, all these songs on the radio suddenly made sense to me.
Have you ever listened to the words to "Time In A Bottle"?
It is so beautiful, man, I had to pull over.
Oh, my God, it's in love.
And last night, for the first time in my life, I actually said those three little words: "Stay for breakfast".
- You had sex with Sharon?
- Doc, please.
We made love.
You know what?
I gotta call her.
No, wait, no, I gotta play hard to get.
But I miss the sound of her voice.
I'm calling her.
No, wait, it's too needy.
Chicks hate that.
I shouldn't call her.
But I want to.
Doc, what should I do?
Don't ask me.
I don't even know who you are.
This was it.
This was the Muckabees store.
Now it's gone and so are the only shoes I ever loved.
Mr Crane, look at me.
We're talking here about something that's old and smelly and dirty.
Hey.
Not you.
We're talking about Muckabees.
Oh, great shoes.
Used to sell them here.
- What happened to the store?
- Moved.
- Do you know where?
- Yeah.
It'll cost you.
- How much?
- No, not money.
I want a kiss.
What?
- You heard him.
- Mr Crane.
You burned them, you owe me.
It's only a kiss.
Not her.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 talk radio.
Thought you'd never finish.
You know, Niles, what say I buy us dinner and a lot of martinis.
Sounds great except for the dinner part.
- I take it you had a bad day too?
- I had an abysmal day.
- Remember the ad I placed?
- Oh, yes.
Dr Niles Crane, - Jung specialist, blah blah blah.
- Well, they've made a tiny little typo.
See if you can find it.
"Niles Crane, hung specialist".
Oh, my.
The rest they got perfectly.
"Servicing individuals, couples, groups.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Tell me where it hurts".
Well, any calls?
- It's a telethon.
- Yes, well - We'll start with double martinis.
- All right.
Wait a second.
I need the name of one of those fancy restaurants you go to.
Hey, hi, Sharon, it's me, Bob.
Hey, I had a great time last night.
Listen, how about dinner tonight?
You do?
All right, how about tomorrow night?
Hey, it's a good thing I'm not paranoid, I'd think you were dumping me.
Well, I walked into that one.
Yeah, me too.
Good luck, Shar - Gee, I'm sorry, Bulldog.
- Me too.
I'll call Francois, see if he can get us a table on the patio.
- Ten seconds, Bulldog.
- Oh, right, right, right.
- Listen, are you gonna be all right?
- What, me?
Are you kidding?
I'm the Bulldog.
Attention, sports fans, you're in the Doghouse.
Uh First, some weekend scores.
In football, the Packers crushed the Saints 42-10, and the 49ers humiliated the Patriots 35-7.
And in golf Golf, hey, golf sucks, right?
Go to calls.
You're in the Doghouse.
Put on a flea collar.
We have the table, but Francois says - he can only hold it for ten minutes.
- In a minute.
MAN 1 : Anyway, what's up with the rumour that the Seahawks are thinking of leaving Seattle again?
I have no respect for that, man.
Anyone who has their fun, then they just leave you, well, hey, to hell with them, right?
We'll get another team.
A team that A team that won't ever leave us.
A team we can love forever.
- You'd better go to commercial.
- I already did.
Bulldog, are you gonna be all right?
Do you think you can tape the show?
Wait, Bulldog, we need a tape.
Where's the Best of Bulldog?
She took the best of Bulldog.
- We've got dead air in 15 seconds.
- Oh, great.
Okay, I'll go get Bulldog.
- You take over the show.
- Me?
A sports show?
You're the only one here.
Okay, sports enthusiasts, this is Dr Frasier Crane filling in for Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.
- You're on the air.
MAN 2: This is Mike.
I wanted to talk to Bulldog, but you'll do.
So, what's your take on the damn Yankees this season?
Are you speaking of the frothy musical adaptation of the Faustian myth or the baseball team of which I know nothing?
MAN 2: What a weenie.
Doesn't that take me back.
But he brings up a good point.
You see, while I'm on the air, please feel free to call in about anything other than sports.
Please.
Hello, you're on the air.
MAN 3: You think it was a good idea for the Sonics to give up those draft choices so they could free up some money under the cap?
You know, to go after a wide body to help them in the paint?
Yes.
You're on the air.
Bulldog!
I know you're in there.
Get out here.
Give me a break, Leonard.
Like you haven't fantasized about this moment.
Go away, Roz.
- Will you grow up.
So you got dumped.
You got a little payback for the way you treated women all your life.
Besides, the Bulldog I know doesn't get sad.
- He gets angry.
You're right.
This stinks!
This is total, total B.S. If you don't come out in the next three seconds, I'm gonna reach in there - and drag you out by your ankles.
- Hello, Roz, playing hard to get?
It's Bulldog.
You're a psychiatrist.
Help him.
As distressed as I am by his condition, he's not the only one suffering here.
In eight minutes we are going to lose our patio table.
Well, as long as Frasier's filling in for Bulldog, you're not going anywhere.
You poor man.
Help is at hand.
No!
No shrinks!
I hate shrinks.
You're all a bunch of wimps, weirdos.
Help me.
There, there.
I'm here for you.
And you're over there for me.
Well, I sense you're in a great deal of pain.
- Yeah.
Make it stop.
- No.
No, the first step toward healing is not to bury the pain, but to feel it at its fullest depths.
Okay, well, before security arrives, let's skip on to step two.
- What is going on?
- Excuse me.
Frasier, we're in session.
We have to pull him together in minutes, not in a lifetime.
- How dare you talk to me like that.
- We don't have time for this.
Get out!
Bulldog, I'm referring you to my brother.
I'll call Francois and tell him there's been a death.
That ought to buy us another ten minutes.
We're on a newsbreak.
You have got to pull yourself together because there is no way I am enduring any more humiliation.
- I am not going out there, man.
- You have got to.
I can't even decipher the abbreviations on the score sheets.
I'm guessing by your producer's guffaws that it is not the Cleveland Independents.
I just never felt this way about a chick before.
I was even thinking about her and me having kids.
- Isn't that scary?
- Positively bone-chilling.
- It hurts like hell.
- I know.
I know, Bulldog.
You know, often through pain we can achieve emotional growth.
It reminds me of a paper I recently presented to the Vancouver Psychiatric Association.
The gravamen of my discourse was that the sufferer, i.e. You Doc, doc, you're hurting my head here.
Can't you stop being a shrink and just be, like, a guy?
Like a guy.
Like a guy.
Screw her!
- What?
- Yeah, you don't need her.
She's trash!
- Yeah, trash.
- You're better off!
We both are!
- I like the sound of this.
- Yeah, so do I!
It's unattractive, yet liberating.
Like the one and only time I wore a European bathing suit.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
She's a bitch!
- Hey, she wasn't even that hot.
All she did was save you the trouble of having to dump her.
- I never thought about that.
- There you go.
- I'm feeling a little better.
- That's right.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
- It's great talking to you.
- Likewise.
You know, I could talk like this for another 30 seconds.
She was nothing!
- She was less than nothing!
- Yeah, right.
Tomorrow you're gonna find somebody even hotter, and you know what you're gonna do?
You're gonna have your fun with her and dump her just for the hell of it!
- Yeah, dump her!
- And you know what?
You're not gonna feel bad about it at all.
You know why?
Because we're guys, and that's what guys do!
Distressing news, Frasier.
Francois gave away our table.
Screw him!
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!
We don't need him or his stinky little restaurant.
There are plenty of restaurants.
I say we go somewhere we don't even need a reservation!
- Thank you, Niles.
- You're welcome.
If we hasten, perhaps we can catch the first seating at Monsieur Galbolon.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Well, look who's up.
BO  It's my parents.
I don't know, they're just, like, really stupid.
- May I ask how old you are?
- Fourteen.
Well, hang on, Jimmy.
Your parents are gonna be stupid for another seven years.
Whoa, seven years?
That's, like, longer than I'll be in high school.
I salute your optimism.
We'll be right back after this.
Oh, God, Roz.
A teenager who's embarrassed by his parents?
Can't you come up with something a little more challenging for me?
It was either him or our old pal Rudy, the crier.
Rudy, the crier.
He's been on three times in the last month.
You put him on again, he won't be the only one who's crying.
God, I'm in a dry spell.
Where are the souls of genuine torment?
The people teetering on the brink of genuine despair?
Oh, they'll be back.
The holidays are just around the corner.
Well, perhaps you're right.
Oh, Roz.
- I've a question I'd like to ask you.
- Shoot.
Have you ever had a recurring dream of an intimate nature about someone Well, a coworker?
- Oh, no, why'd you tell me?
- Oh, Roz.
Now it's gonna be creepy every time you look at me through the glass.
Roz, not you!
- Who was it then?
- I'm not gonna go into specifics.
- Gina in accounting?
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Oh, Sheila, the slow intern?
- Forget I even mentioned it.
Knock, knock.
Gil.
Frasier, I've come to tempt you.
Really?
I am reviewing the new pastry chef at Chez Shea.
And I quote: "His amaretto ëclair is so sinful, it will send you scurrying to your local padre for absolution".
No, thank you, Gil.
I'm on a diet, you see.
- Oh, come now, you know you want it.
- No, no, no, I really don't.
Off you go.
Bye-bye.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- It was Gil!
- I never said that.
- Then why are you blushing?
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Your ears are turning red.
- I am not.
You are.
Still not blushing.
MAN : Just lying there in the hospital bed, she lifted her head off the pillow, looked up and said, "I love you".
And then she was gone.
Rudy, stop crying.
Now, we've gone over this before.
What was our agreement about sad movies?
- I shouldn't watch them.
- Exactly.
Now, go get a cool washcloth to try to bring down the puffiness around your eyes, and please stay away from sad or depressing things.
Which, at this moment, includes listening to the Frasier Crane Show.
Well, let's shoot it to the news.
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Oh, my God!
Well, close the record books.
That was just the dullest three hours in the history of the Frasier Crane Show.
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad.
What about the woman who was so concerned about her appearance - she wouldn't leave the house?
- That was a commercial!
I believe Miss Clairol solved the problem.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
Oh, Roz.
About that dream I mentioned to you earlier It goes without saying, I'd rather you didn't share that.
- Oh, sure.
- Hi, dream boy.
I hate you.
Couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you?
Just when did you find the time to spread the news?
You don't think I was listening to your show, do you?
Coming through!
Oh, doc, I gotta rub this one in a little.
All right, Bulldog, before you start to ridicule me, yes, yes, I had a dream about Gil, and, yes, it did have some erotic elements, but You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
I do now.
Whoa!
Look, let's just forget it.
What delightful jibe did you have prepared for me?
Oh, I was gonna tell you your show today just broke the snooze-o-meter, but now I wanna hear about you greasing Gil's cookie sheet.
I'm on a bus to hell.
So I returned to the dry cleaners yet a third time.
I hardly need to tell you how the story ends.
Just tell me when the story ends.
Fine.
They realigned my pleats.
The end.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I'm just a bit distracted today.
See, this morning a man from my building, approached me with an intriguing problem.
Seems he's been having a recurring dream.
Please, that little gambit didn't work when we were in knee socks.
- What was your dream, Frasier?
- Oh, all right.
It's been tormenting me.
I haven't been able to sleep in weeks now.
It's a bit hazy, but it starts out in a seedy motel room.
- I'm naked.
- Interesting.
Yes, well, I roll over and discover on my forearm a tattoo with the word "chesty".
- Interesting.
- Yes.
And then the shower turns off.
Out from the bathroom steps a man.
All right, go ahead, let me have it.
Are you saying that now, or is that a quote from the dream?
Please.
We're too intelligent to waste time on the obvious interpretation.
Yes.
But you must admit it's rather intriguing.
Would you stop?
It's obviously screaming for a Jungian interpretation.
The sexuality in the dream is surely symbolic of some deeper non-sexual conflict.
- All right.
- Good afternoon, Frasier.
- Gil.
- A little birdie tells me, I was featured in your midnight movie.
Very clever.
Off you go.
Very well.
See you tomorrow, or should I say, see you in your dreams.
In this dream of yours, were there any cigars, bananas or short, blunt swords?
Would you stop it?
I'm 43, a little late for latency.
- You guys okay over here?
- We're fine.
Well, you must be new here.
I would've remembered such a pretty face as yours.
- You're overcompensating.
- Right.
We're fine.
Bye-bye.
I'm just baffled by it.
Gil Chesterton explains "chesty," but little else.
You should tackle this from a free-association standpoint.
- Oh, God.
Must we?
- Focus on a detail in the motel room.
What's the first thing that pops into your mind?
A crescent-shaped lamp.
Perfect.
A crescent-shaped lamp.
Run with that.
Crescent.
Moon.
Daphne Moon.
French maid.
- Brass bed.
Satin rope.
- Niles!
- This is my dream.
- I was just showing you the process.
You were three words away from a cigarette.
- Your turn.
- All right.
- Crescent lamp.
- Crescent.
Croissant.
Butter.
Apricot jam.
Hunger.
Food.
Diet.
My God, I've been on a diet.
Do you think that's useful?
You could stand to lose a few pounds.
Just wait a minute.
All right, Gil is a restaurant critic.
He's a gourmet.
Perhaps he's symbolic of the food I've been denying myself.
That would explain why you're naked.
It's when we're most self-conscious about our bodies.
Yes, and most vulnerable to the way society tattoos us, with labels about our appearance.
Oh, my God, that's it, Niles.
The dream is simply telling me that I've been too rigid about my diet.
You'll know tonight.
If this is the correct interpretation, the conflict will have passed from your unconscious to your conscious mind.
Yes.
The dream will have served its purpose.
- And you'll no longer be plagued by it.
- Oh, God.
I've nailed it.
I really have.
Finally, for the first time in weeks, there'll be no tequila bottles, no tattoo, no half-naked man in my bed.
So then the rabbi says   Oh, I'm sorry.
Wrong room.
That does it.
We're finding another motel.
Oh, God.
Hello.
Someone followed me again last night.
You're just being paranoid.
I'm telling you, they're on to me.
Come on, nobody could recognize you after all that plastic surgery.
That's what Marlena thought.
Marlena got sloppy.
She never should've gone back to Zürich.
I just don't want any more bloodshed.
Relax, you're home-free.
You don't know the Woodchuck and his ways.
- Oh, we're terrible.
- We are?
You are.
"The Woodchuck and his ways"?
You know, we really should stop doing this.
It's not nice.
Yeah, you're right.
We won't do it anymore.
How'd you get the stuff through customs?
They never check the wooden leg.
The answer has got to be in there somewhere.
Here's something.
"Dreams as an expression of wish-fulfilment".
Moving on.
Goodness, are you two still here?
- What are you working on?
- Nothing.
I'm helping Frasier interpret a dream he's been having.
You know, maybe Dad can help.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Don't want to bore Dad with the details of this particular dream.
Dreams can be rooted in childhood experience.
Maybe Dad remembers something you repressed.
Gee, I don't know.
If it's about when you were a kid, I've repressed a lot of that myself.
This is not a dream I wish to share with Dad, thank you very much.
We've exhausted every other interpretation, so I guess it's back to dreams as wish-fulfilment.
Oh, Dad, would you mind listening to my dream to see if it conjures up any memories from my childhood?
Oh, come on, you're making too much out of this.
It's a dream.
Dreams are weird.
Okay, please, Dad, I wouldn't ask if it weren't really bothering me.
- Oh, all right.
Go on.
- All right now.
It starts out in a little motel room.
I have a tattoo on my arm, "chesty".
See?
That's weird.
Yes, but then out from the bathroom steps a All right, now before I continue, just let me remind you that this is a dream, not to be confused with reality.
Out from the bathroom steps a man eating lion.
Oh, see?
There again, weird.
Look, dreams come, they go.
They don't mean anything.
Except if you're lucky once in a while, you might have one that's fun.
Like, you know, you're hitting a home run in the World Series, or you're in the jungle with Jayne Mansfield - and she gets bit by a snake.
- Thank you, Dad.
- You know who Jayne Mansfield is?
- Yes, Dad.
- Know what they do when you're bit?
- Yes, Dad.
Wish I knew what I had for dinner that night.
Oh, I get it.
"Chesty" refers to Gil Chesterton.
Niles, you gossipy fishwife.
There's no reason to feel self-conscious, Dr Crane.
We've all had dreams like that.
I had one about a girl I shared a flat with once.
A gymnast.
Go on, Daphne.
This could be significant.
Well, I remember we were doing stretches in the gymnasium, when suddenly we decided to take off all our clothes and go for a bounce on the trampoline.
The next thing you know, I'm chasing her around the pommel horse and Oh, never mind.
Don't stop now.
This could help us.
Well, actually, I do have a theory of me own about your dream, - if you'd like to hear it.
- What the hell.
Well, in your dream, who was in the shower?
Gil.
What is a shower?
Running water.
Who needs water?
Fish.
What do fish have?
Gills.
Do you see where I'm going?
Insane.
It could be a dream about the loss of a beloved childhood pet.
Thanks a lot, Eddie.
Forty-five minutes in the park, you don't have to go.
I get one bite into my sandwich, and you give me the look.
Mr Crane, did Dr Crane ever have a goldfish growing up?
- A fish?
- Yes, as a pet.
How would I know?
That was Hester's department.
Come on, let's go.
Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That Dad can interpret the looks from his dog and has only the spottiest recollections of our childhood?
No, no, no.
Hester.
Hesty.
The tattoo.
That's only one letter away from chesty.
Then are you saying that the dream could have been about Mother?
Well?
I suppose I could've misread the tattoo.
Yes, this freckle pattern here on my arm could be mistaken for a C. And what swims in the sea?
Fish.
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Well, so, the tattoo could've said "Hesty".
But the problem is I don't ever remember Dad calling Mom that.
But who's to say he didn't?
NILES &  Dad, Dad, Dad.
- What?
Did you ever have a nickname for Mother?
Oh, for God's sakes, this to do with that stupid dream?
- Dad, this is really important.
- Any pet name?
A term of endearment?
Well, when we were first married, I used to call her "honey".
And then there was a time after that that I started calling her "sweetie".
I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote behind each one of those, but did you ever call her Hesty?
- Hesty?
- Oh, come on!
Think, man!
Even once.
Once in all the years you lived together?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I guess.
- Maybe once, you know.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.
Well, there it is.
I must have heard him call her Hesty once, and neatly tucked it away into my subconscious.
Of course.
It's so obvious.
Gil is a food critic.
Food.
Criticism.
Mother!
It's the classic Oedipal dream.
Yes.
Only I was so frightened by my sexual urges to be with my mother that I transformed her into a man.
Oh, what a relief.
I've been wringing my hands over nothing.
I mean it's okay.
All I want to do is have sex with my dead mother.
Mom?
Mommy?
Patience, Daddy.
You'd think by now I'd know better than to have that third Slim Jim before going to bed.
- You couldn't sleep either, huh?
- No.
Frankly, I'm sort of afraid to go back to sleep.
It's that damn dream again.
Oh, what are you worried about?
It's just a dream.
Worst case scenario: The man-eating lion leaps on top of you and mauls you.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I wasn't completely truthful with you before.
The dream is really about me in a motel room with a male companion, Gil Chesterton.
You don't care if I ever sleep again, do you?
Dad, please.
I'd really like to discuss this.
No, Frasier, please.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Dad, please?
- I know, I know.
In your generation, men talk about everything.
Everything's out in the open.
You know, what really drives me crazy is the way you all touch each other.
Everybody hugs, you know.
In my generation, it was a handshake.
That was good enough, and maybe if you felt especially close to someone, you could touch them on the shoulder, but never for more than two seconds.
And don't talk to me about football players patting people's butts and everything because that's different.
That's sports.
- That's like war.
Now, good night, son.
- Dad!
If you wanna tell me something, write it on a Post-it, - and stick it on the fridge.
- Look, I really want to talk about this.
I've exhausted every other interpretation of this dream.
Is it possible my subconscious is trying to tell me something about my sexuality?
- Oh, that's ridiculous!
- Is it?
I was sensitive as a child.
I didn't go in for sports.
God, it's every clichë in the book.
Surely it must have occurred to you at some point.
You refused to take me to see West Side Story on my birthday.
Well, because of the gangs.
- That's scary for kids.
- Even gangs that dance?
Especially gangs that dance.
All right, yeah, okay.
Yeah, I thought about it, but, no, Frasier, no.
I don't believe that.
And you know why?
Because you would've known by now.
Your unconscious or whatever the hell you call it could no more have kept its yap shut than the rest of you.
- I suppose you're right.
- Yeah.
Now, come on, it's after 3.
You're gonna be worn out before the show tomorrow.
- What a tragedy that would be.
- Now what're you complaining about?
Oh, no, just I haven't had any really interesting calls lately.
I'm beginning to question whether I'm bored with psychiatry.
You'd never know it the way you got your nose stuck in all those books.
That's true.
The one saving grace about this dream is it's given me a chance to flex my analytical muscle a bit.
So maybe it wasn't so bad after all.
Wait a minute.
Could that be what this has been all about?
I've been so intellectually unchallenged lately by my show that my mind had to create a dream that defies interpretation - just to give me a challenge?
- I don't know, keep talking.
You're making me sleepy.
Dad, no, that's got to be it!
My show hasn't provided me with a single patient worthy of my skills.
And I had to invent one myself.
Me.
Oh, God, what a relief.
At last, finally, to bed.
Dad, you witnessed an epiphany.
Yeah, God, I gotta get you to put this on tape.
Well, off we go.
To sleep, perchance not to dream.
Come in.
Dr Crane?
Dr Sigmund Freud.
- My goodness, this is quite an honour.
- The honour is all mine.
I gave you a complex psychological problem, and you solved it.
- Thank you - You're a brilliant psychiatrist.
Oh, that's very flattering, but there are so many things I'd like to ask you.
In good time, my boy, in good time.
Right now we have more important matters.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Is it me or is the foam a tad dense today?
Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.
Rather than accent, it overwhelms.
Rather than flirt, it assaults.
Rather than watching the ball game, I have to listen to this.
Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Roz.
- Like to join us?
- Oh, yes.
Frasier, listen, don't forget your staff meeting tomorrow.
It starts at Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix the holes you just burnt in his jacket.
They're not in his jacket.
- It starts tomorrow at 10.
- Thank you.
Hey, Marty, what are you doing here?
They're dragging me out to buy some new clothes.
We're taking him to Rudolfo's once-a-year sale.
It's 50 percent off.
The alterations are free.
Big deal.
Butz Clothiers, they do that every day.
Yes, not to mention the convenience of getting your pizza right next door.
These guys think I have bad taste in clothes.
I like the way you dress.
That's what's called the "clincher".
Shall we go?
All right.
Well, I'll just hit the head, and we can get it over with.
Dad, you could show more enthusiasm.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Gee, I can't wait to hit the head, and we can get it all over with!
Are you finished undressing him with your eyes?
Please.
I'm already looking for my stockings and trying to remember where I parked my car.
I would have thought that gentleman over there in the flannel shirt would be more your type.
Him?
Not a chance.
See the way he's slurping his orange juice?
Sloppy kisser.
Now, you can tell right away the guy is no good in bed.
He's so cautious.
Look at the way he's blowing on his coffee.
I wasn't trying to cool it, I was simply blowing a foam hole.
You don't even wrinkle the sheets, do you?
Niles, that man across the street at the newsstand.
Is that who I think it is?
He does look familiar.
- It's T.H. Houghton.
- No!
Just think back to the picture on the dust cover of his Time Flies Tomorrow.
- A little older, greyer - Yeah, Time Flies Tomorrow.
I read that in high school.
- What else did he write?
Nothing.
That's the crux of his legend.
The man published one masterpiece, and in the 30 years since, he's become a virtual recluse.
- Oh, my God.
It is T.H. Houghton.
- Yes.
We're a stone's throw away from one of the giants of literature.
Not the way you throw.
Oh, Niles, this is incredible.
My God, the man's entire life is shrouded in mystery, yet there he is.
I've always idolized him.
What I wouldn't give to meet that man.
Why don't you go introduce yourself.
Oh, I can't just walk up to a god like that.
Well, then find a subtler way.
In your vernacular, that would be what?
To slingshot your panties across the street?
- Foam blower.
- All right, all right, you two.
Niles, she happens to be right.
How often do you get an opportunity like this?
Let's go.
All right.
- Come on, we're going.
- Why?
What's the rush?
- T. H. Houghton is across the street.
- Who?
- Come on, let's Let's go!
Hey, guy with a cane here!
Niles, I thought you said you saw Houghton come in here.
Well, I'm sorry if my tracking skills aren't up to your standard.
Instead of asking for a baby brother, you should have asked for a German short-haired pointer.
I did.
Well, I'm sorry.
He must still be out on the street.
I'm parking it.
They got the Mariners on.
- Please, we can't waste time.
- Let him be.
He's deadweight.
Right.
- What's the score?
- Four to three, Mariners.
Aw!
- How could he miss the cut-off man?
- That man makes 7 million a year.
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.
See him scratching his butt?
That's about 5 grand right there.
- Let me have a Ballantine's.
- Yeah, make it two.
Aw!
So that's your favourite character?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I really like him.
The kind of guy you can just sit and have a beer with.
Well, I could see you saying that about Hoss, but Little Joe?
That's the great thing about Bonanza.
Something for everyone.
Well, thank you, Mr False Alarm.
"Oh, look, there he is, over at the yogurt store!
Oh, look, there he is, in the futon store!
Oh, look, there he is with Dad"!
And now he's leaving.
I must tell him what an impact his book has made.
Aren't you afraid it'll sound unoriginal?
- Why?
- I'm gonna say it first.
Excuse me, Mr Houghton?
- Yeah?
- I just wanted to tell you that - My book changed your life.
Swell.
- No, no, but I - It changed mine too.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't like to discuss my work.
Well, that was humiliating.
I've never felt so rejected in my life.
Now, now, don't take it so hard.
Who was to know he was so sensitive?
- Aren't you Dr Crane from the radio?
- Not now, haven't got the time, sorry.
Do you realize who you were just talking to?
- That was T. H. Houghton.
- Yeah, I know.
Well, well, well, what did you two talk about?
- Oh, I don't know.
This and that.
Dad, virtually nothing is known about this man.
Can't you give us something specific?
Well, it was just guy stuff, you know.
Baseball, TV shows, old war stories - He told war stories?
- No, I did.
You know, about the time I made the stew and the platoon got sick.
Dad, how could you?
What?
He liked it.
He's a nice guy.
I think maybe I'll buy one of his books.
Not books, Dad.
Book.
Book.
He wrote one book and never wrote again.
If only we'd arrived ten minutes earlier, we could've talked to him.
We could have explored that mammoth intellect.
Can you imagine the torture the man's endured, to peak at such an early age?
Oh, my God, Frasier, look.
It's a doodle!
Not just any doodle, a Houghton doodle.
- It's mine!
- No, mine!
- It's mine.
- Dad, what do you care?
No, I mean I drew it.
That's very touching.
This is for you.
Bye-bye.
I don't know when I've enjoyed an exhibit more.
The artist's choice to make that a monochrome was a stroke of genius.
- It conveyed such despair.
Yes.
It was so refreshing to see a sad peach.
How about that curator?
She was kind of a peach herself.
- No cubism there, I don't think.
- No, certainly not.
Hey, boys.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Oh, Ted.
Ted, I'd like you to meet my sons.
This is Frasier and Niles.
They're big fans.
- Hi, guys.
Mr Houghton We Words can't express I guess not.
Nice meeting you fellas.
Oh, my God, we missed him again!
- What's going on?
- That's odd.
So where are you two going?
Well, Ted's taking me out to this bratwurst place he knows.
Bratwurst?
Yummy.
My God, that's our favourite.
Nice meeting you.
- What's wrong with this thing?
Well, it could be broken.
If you came in to the apartment, we'll call the front No!
I'm sure it'll work this time.
What the hell was he doing here?
We might know if you hadn't spent an hour pondering the despair of the peach.
From the man who spent 30 minutes looking at Woman with a Rectangular Head.
Oh, was Mrs Foster in the lobby again?
No, Daphne.
Could you explain to me just how T. H. Houghton ended up in my apartment?
Well, he's only in town for a couple of days, and he doesn't know too many people, so he looked your father up, gave him a ring, and Mr Crane invited him over to watch the Mariners game.
- He was here all afternoon?
Yes.
Oh, it's a shame you couldn't be here, because he told the most fascinating stories.
And, of course, he and your father are getting on like old chums.
But the sweetest thing was how he took to Eddie.
He He spent time with Eddie?
Fed him his afternoon biscuit.
Will the madness never end!
Oh, now, now.
Let's not give up hope.
Maybe Dad'll bring him back after dinner.
Oh, well, I doubt it.
They'll probably run into J.D. Salinger and Salman Rushdie and go out for margaritas.
I tell you, Niles, these near misses, they're just excruciating.
There you go, Mr Houghton.
You're welcome.
- Was that him?
- Yes, he forgot his coat.
Make way, Daphne!
We missed him again.
Don't you dare gloat, you miserable little biscuit whore.
Thanks, Eddie.
- Afternoon, Daphne.
- Hello.
Good dog.
Oh, Dr Crane, it's a good thing you're home.
Mr Houghton's dropping by to pick up your father for the Mariners game.
- Are you serious?
He's coming back?
- Yes, any minute.
It's a double-header.
- They play two games.
- Oh, right.
But this is This is incredibly good fortune for me.
I'll finally get to spend some time alone with the man, even for a few minutes.
Daphne, be a dear and stall Dad, will you.
If he gives you any trouble, just hide his cane.
Niles!
What fortuitous timing.
The wine shop called a moment ago.
They're down to their last cases of the '82 Chambolle-Musigny.
Why don't you dash down before somebody snaps it all up.
Bless you, Frasier.
Hold it.
You know very well that in 1982, there was a drought in Bourgogne.
The locals dubbed it the "Year of the Raisin".
And that wine was never sold by the case, only by the bottle.
T. H. Houghton is here, isn't he?
- No.
- Fine.
Then you won't mind if I just hang around for a while.
Oh, all right.
He's on his way.
He and Dad are going to a baseball game.
It's a double-header.
They play two games.
Oh, hi, Niles.
Oh, Dad, so I hear that Mr Houghton is on his way over.
Maybe we could all have lunch.
- That's a splendid idea.
- No, the game starts in 45 minutes.
Perhaps you could come by after for a drink.
No, sorry, that won't work either.
He's gotta go to his publisher's, drop off his new book.
Houghton has a new book?
I've lost the feeling in my legs.
Well, did he say anything about it?
I mean, the characters, the setting?
- No, he just said it was a book.
- Dad.
You have to skip the game.
It's not just for our benefit.
After all this baseball, the man must be starved for intellectual stimulation.
I know what you're saying.
That someone like that would prefer to spend time with you instead of some dumbbell like me.
Dad, you're not dumb.
You missed the point entirely.
Let's just say, for example, you came home one afternoon and I was sitting here discussing literature with, I don't know, give me the name of a player.
- Darryl Strawberry.
- No, a real one!
Frasier, the problem is you push too hard.
We just talk sports, have a few laughs.
That's all.
You know, I never ask him about his work.
That's probably why he told me about the book.
- Mr Houghton, hello.
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hey, Ted, come on in.
Fine.
So you two boys are off to the baseball game, huh?
Double-header.
That's two games.
Yeah.
Little-known fact about baseball.
The owner of the Boston Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees to finance a Broadway musical, No, No, Nanette.
- You ready, Marty?
- Let's go.
Well, I really enjoyed chatting with you.
If you'd drop back by after the game, we could pick up where we left off.
No, No, Nanette?
I'm sorry, there were exactly two things I could possibly add to a baseball conversation.
That and No, just the one.
- Frasier?
- Yes.
Have you noticed how Houghton carries a satchel with him wherever he goes?
Well, actually, as a matter of fact, I have, yes.
Didn't Dad mention that Houghton was on his way to his publisher's after the game with a new manuscript?
Yes.
Wouldn't that be the very same satchel which is now resting under my head?
Oh, my God!
- Wait!
- Should we?
We shouldn't.
- Could we live with ourselves if we did?
- Could we live with ourselves - if we didn't?
- Could we live either way?
Oh, stop it, Niles!
Oh, who are we kidding?
All right.
Careful, careful, careful.
"The Chameleon's Song by T. H. Houghton".
These are handwritten corrections.
Frasier, this is his original manuscript.
Shame on you!
Going through someone else's personal property.
Well, it's just plain wrong.
And I know your father wouldn't approve.
Of course, I wouldn't be here to tell him if I had the day off.
- Fine, go.
- Oh, great.
Of course, having a day off is pretty meaningless when you have no money to, you know, maybe go to lunch or do some shopping.
Perhaps take in a show.
Oh, thanks.
- All right, Niles, shall we?
- Not yet.
- The atmosphere has to be perfect.
- Good point, yes.
Let's begin with the lighting.
All right, just say when.
Warmer.
Warmer.
A little cooler.
A touch warmer.
A hair back.
No, no, just No, a hair the other way.
No, a touch warmer.
- Perfect.
- Good.
Excellent, excellent.
What wine would most enhance the experience?
No, Niles.
Wine might dull our faculties.
Perhaps instead a slow-sipping cordial would be the proper garnish.
- Sherry.
- Armagnac.
Oh, well, see?
That's why you're the older brother.
- What is it?
- I don't think you're there yet.
Well, it's a masterpiece.
Eddie.
I never thought I'd utter these words, but it actually surpasses Time Flies Tomorrow.
Eddie, please!
We're trying to savour the moment.
How was the game?
Is that my manuscript?
What the hell's going on?
You went through my bag?
- That's my personal property.
- I don't believe you two.
Mr Houghton, we We are terribly, terribly sorry.
The temptation to read it was just too great.
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?
You're grown men, at least I thought you were.
You had no right to touch that.
Ted, I'm sorry.
I'm just so ashamed.
- Now, it's all right.
- No, it's not all right.
No, no, it's okay, really.
Somebody had to read it first.
So, what did you think?
- Of the book?
- No, of my typing.
Yes, of course, the book.
It was great.
Wow.
Well, at least you liked it.
I'm gonna have to be running.
Are you sure?
I was gonna make some coffee.
No, no, I got an appointment.
Can I use the?
- It's right here.
Okay.
Boy, I've had it with you guys.
If you were Hoss and Little Joe, Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry butts right off the Ponderosa!
Dad.
Dad, we're sorry.
Very sorry.
He's back on the Cartwrights again.
You know, someday we really should ask him just who the hell they are.
You know, Niles, one thing just really bugs me.
Houghton's gonna leave thinking we're just a couple of inarticulate simpletons.
What were those pithy comments we made about his masterpiece?
- "It was great".
"Wow".
Yes, we'll go down in history with the same boob who first read Hamlet, then told Shakespeare, "My goodness, what a parchment-turner"!
Well, it's not too late.
He hasn't left yet.
Yes, yes, we could still say something to show him that we appreciated the full complexity of his work.
Mr Houghton, you know, there is one further thing - I'd like to add about your book.
- Yeah.
Well, it's the way you modulated into the second-person narrative during the flashback scene.
Frankly, beggars anything Faulkner attempted.
Really?
That's very flattering.
Oh, wait, I have one too.
The way you so skilfully mirrored the structure of Dante's Divine Comedy was inspired.
Really?
Yes, from the inferno of the bordello  Which, we noticed, had exactly nine rooms.
- To the purgatory of the assembly line, and finally to the paradise of the farm.
You both saw that?
Oh, it practically jumped off the page.
Well, that's very perceptive of you.
Well, thank you.
I guess it's our turn to be flattered.
You're absolutely right.
This whole book is crap.
Beg your pardon?
How could I be so blind?
I lifted the entire structure from Dante!
- You mean you weren't going for that?
- Of course not!
This confirms my worst fear.
I have nothing original left to say.
I'm an empty shell.
I was a fool to think I had a second book in me!
"The winters were harsh on the farm".
Well, here's something to warm them up!
What's going on here?
You're both right.
I'm a talentless hack who got lucky once.
- We didn't say that!
- You're not listening to them?
- Look at this trash!
It won't burn!
- It's a fireplace, you see.
- It's not well ventilated.
- This doesn't belong in a fireplace.
It belongs in the gutter, with the rest of society's garbage!
Wait.
No, no  Ted, don't do that!
- Ted, no!
Don't do it!
No, Mr Houghton I want to thank you two.
If I had published that book, my reputation would have been destroyed.
At least now I'm left with a shred of dignity.
No.
Happy?
Hey, Ted, wait up!
Well, we've destroyed a man's life.
Not to mention depriving future generations of a work of art.
Yes, well, on the other hand, had he actually published it, the critics surely would've noticed that Dante parallel.
If he felt bad now, imagine how he would've felt reading it - in The New York Review of Books.
- Oh, God, yes.
Given his fragile ego, my God, he would've been devastated.
Who knows what he might have done.
Do you know, Niles, we saved that man's life.
Yes, I think you're right.
- On the other hand - Don't go there.
See, that's why you're the older brother.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
So I decided it was time I got to know some of my colleagues in the media.
- But a convention?
- Mm.
You've never shown any interest before.
They've never held one in Aspen before.
Just think, hundreds of radio psychiatrists, all in the same location.
One well-timed avalanche and the dignity of the entire psychiatric profession could be restored.
Oh, good one.
I can always count on you for some witty retort.
I insult you, and you compliment me.
Could the request for a favour be far behind?
Damn.
You are perceptive.
- Oh, stop it.
- Oh, all right.
Listen, Niles, I'd like you to do my show for me for the week I'm gone.
Me standing in for you?
I'm sorry, Frasier, I couldn't presume to fill those big, floppy red shoes of yours.
Please, please, Niles.
Look, I'm begging you.
The station wants to replace me with Helen Grogan, better known as Ma Nature.
She does a gardening show, and I'm just a little worried that a week of discussing well-rotted manure will weaken my listener base.
It hasn't yet.
Very well.
You leave me no alternative but to call in my marker.
What marker?
Oh, I think you know.
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You can't.
- I will.
That was three years ago.
I don't recall there being any statute of limitations.
I distinctly recall that when you asked me to go out with Maris' sister, you said that you would owe me one forever.
But you only spent one evening with Brie.
That hardly compares to what you're asking me to endure.
Shall I refresh your memory?
Midway through the opera, her ermine muff began to tremble.
As it turned out, she had used it to smuggle in her adorably incontinent chihuahua.
Just as I thought we'd reached the low point of the evening, I suddenly felt a sandpaper tongue licking my earlobe.
Alas, it did not belong to little Hervë.
Fortunately, my shriek coincided with the onstage murder of Gondalfo.
Roz will expect you on Monday at 2.
For your information, Brie had a very tough row to hoe growing up.
It's not easy going through life with only one nostril.
Did I mention she had a cold that night?
Monday at 2 it is.
We're at the point where all communication has broken down.
- He won't even listen to me.
- Linda.
Do you how annoying that is, not to be listened to?
- Linda.
- It's driving me crazy.
I was hoping maybe you would speak to him directly.
Excuse me one moment.
Thank you for the brilliant job of call-screening.
How do I get out of this?
Did you think of saying there are other callers on the line?
Linda, I'd love to go into this in more depth, but, unfortunately, we're nearly out of time and Roz has lots of other callers waiting anxiously on the line.
Actually, Dr Crane, all our lines are open.
So you can talk to him?
Good.
I'm putting him on the line right now.
- Go ahead.
- All right.
Murray, you're dealing with your problem in a very self-destructive manner.
It won't be solved by refusing to eat.
Do you hear me?
Oh, my God, it's working.
He's eating.
Dr Crane, what did you say to him?
Well, I'd like to tell you, but that would violate doctor-cat confidentiality.
Oh, well, Seattle, I'm afraid we're out of time.
This is Dr Niles Crane, one down, four to go.
See you tomorrow.
That little bit of sabotage was not amusing.
Then why did coffee come out of my nose?
Hey, Dr Dolittle, I heard your show.
- It didn't suck.
- "Dear diary" So how's it feel?
Like I'm walking away from my lamppost and counting the bills in my garter belt.
Okay, both of you get out of here.
I gotta set up for my show.
I got Reggie MacLemore on my show today.
Don't ask me why.
- I wasn't even going to ask who.
- He's a guard for the Sonics.
He used to be unstoppable.
Twenty points a game, easy.
Now he's in the tank.
Just what I need on my show, a loser.
Oh, look, there he is now.
What an overpaid, worthless piece of - Hey, Reggie, my man!
- What's up?
How you doing, man?
You never call me unless you need tickets, man.
What's up with that?
I love this guy.
Reggie MacLemore, Roz Doyle.
- Hi.
I'm a big fan of yours.
- Thanks.
I'd introduce you to this guy, but he doesn't know squat about sports.
On the contrary.
In prep school, I was an ardent sportsman.
Until an inflamed instep forced me to resign from the croquet club.
I'll see myself out.
Oh, hey, wait a minute.
You're the shrink.
I heard you in my car on the way over.
Dr Niles Crane.
It's a pleasure.
Doc, wait.
You sounded like you really know what you're talking about.
Anyway, there's this sort of problem I've been having, and I was wondering Maybe you could help me out.
Well, what is it?
Well, you see, for the last two weeks, every time I get my hands on the pill, I choke.
Well, have you tried mashing it with a spoon?
You don't watch much basketball, do you?
It's my game, man.
Because of me, we've lost six in a row.
Oh, well, I'm not very well versed in sports psychology, but I could certainly schedule a session.
No, no, I need something fast, man.
We got Phoenix tonight.
This is highly irregular, but since you're pressed, there are exercises I could suggest.
Oh, great, man.
Thanks, man.
You know what, just name it.
Tickets to any game you want.
Nothing wrong with your sense of humour.
Have a seat.
We'll start with a positive visualization.
I want you to close your eyes, take a deep breath.
Good.
Now, I want you to imagine yourself on the playing surface, doing whatever it is you actually do.
Tell me what you see.
- Okay.
Kemp's passing me the ball.
- Mm-hm.
- I'm bringing it up court.
- Mm-hm.
- I'm dribbling.
- Don't worry about your appearance.
Start again, and I'll just be quiet.
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Yeah, forget it, he's married.
Hey, that's pretty offensive.
Why do you assume that's what I wanted?
Okay, then, what did you want?
Well, I don't know, I just wanted to  Time's up.
Oh, by the way, if you're so hungry for some good-looking, athletic guy, why won't you go out with me?
If you're not at least this tall, you can't go on this ride.
This next exercise is designed to block negative feelings.
I've tried it myself.
Simply take a moment, think of something comforting from childhood: A stuffed animal, a dog-eared copy of Middlemarch.
You may have other memories.
Come on, Reggie, shake it.
I gotta run.
Hey, but thanks a lot, doc.
I'll give it a try.
Okay.
Oh, wait, I saw this.
It has steps, right?
Later, man.
- You know, according to this article - No, quiet.
That's three seconds.
Come on, he's camping out in the middle.
No, don't double the ball.
They'll just swing it around for a three.
There it is.
Just like I said.
Oh!
Oh, timeout.
Sure, now you listen to me.
You believe this?
Two minutes ago, we were up six points Shh!
Quiet.
This is my favourite commercial.
No, don't pick that floor cleaner.
It'll give your floors waxy build-up.
No, don't do it.
Don't do it!
Dahh!
It's completely different.
There's Dr Crane.
It'll be a pleasure to be around one man who's not obsessed with sports.
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hello.
Oh, the Sonics are on, excuse me.
- So, Dad - Hold it, Niles.
There's only nine seconds to go.
- What's the score?
- What do you care?
No, get it to MacLemore, to MacLemore.
He's got the hot hand.
Yes!
Come on, Reggie!
Unbelievable.
Sonics win!
- This is fantastic.
You know, Dad - Wait, wait.
I wanna see the replay.
No, get it to MacLemore.
Unbelievable!
- You might be interested to know - Quiet, I wanna see the interview.
REPORTER : Reggie, got a minute?
Great game tonight.
Seems like your slump is over.
Yeah, I was really feeling it out there tonight.
What turned it around for you?
Well, I was having a little problem getting my head together, but this radio shrink really helped me out.
Dr Niles Crane.
- Well, good luck against Utah.
- Thanks a lot.
Let's send it back upstairs.
You?
- Is that so hard to believe?
- Yeah.
- When did you talk to him?
- He was on Bulldog's show today.
We had a brief session in the hallway.
Not more than two minutes.
You turned Reggie's game around in only two minutes?
Well, you could be a little less surprised.
I am a skilled psychiatrist.
After 16 years in the field, I have developed certain instincts.
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
I'm starting to think maybe I should spend an hour or two on the couch with you.
Are you kidding?
With Niles, it'd only take two minutes.
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, doc, great job.
Go Sonics.
- You're the man.
- Thank you.
Same to you.
Way to go.
Heavens, I need a clip and a buff.
There he is, the toast of Seattle.
You know you made the sports section of the paper this morning?
Yes, I'd heard.
I must admit, I find this all a bit mystifying.
Do people really care this much about a basketball game?
Are you kidding?
This is Seattle.
It rains nine months out of the year.
We take our indoor sports very seriously.
Well, I know you always have.
You're a hero today, so I'm gonna let that one go.
Pucker up, baby, I'm planting a big, wet one on you.
Muah!
Well, there's a layer of skin I'll be exfoliating this evening.
- I had 200 bucks on the Sonics.
- Two hundred?
Isn't gambling illegal?
- Isn't he the cutest?
- Oh, yes.
- Down.
Down.
- Okay.
I hope you don't feel this way about chicks.
I got one of those Sonics cheerleaders coming on my show today, and she really wants to see you.
Believe it or not, Bulldog, not every man's dream woman is a pompom-shaking, half-time halfwit.
Is she the head cheerleader?
Yeah, and she's coming in costume.
Of course she is.
It's radio.
Look at these faxes that came for you.
Faxes?
"Seattle thanks you".
"You're the Sonics' MVP".
- Most valuable player.
- Oh!
"You're a genius".
With the less-common J spelling.
But still, his point is well taken.
I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself.
Suddenly I'm being revered as a god by the same troglodytes who in junior high school tried to pack me into my own briefcase.
It's glorious.
Oh, I almost forgot the best part.
Reggie sent these tickets for tonight's game over.
Well, I suppose I can't disappoint my new fans.
Tell me, does one still wear a white sweater jauntily tied around the neck to these things?
If one wants to get the crap beat out of one.
- Hey.
- Dad.
What a surprise.
I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?
- No, come in.
Is everything all right?
- Oh, sure, sure.
I was just having lunch at McGinty's, and some of the guys would really like to meet you, and I was hoping that after your show, you could stop in for a drink.
I mean, I wouldn't ask you, but some of these guys are my best buddies.
Actually, Dad, Reggie sent over these tickets to tonight's game, and I was going to ask you to go, but since The hell with those guys.
I'm there.
I have to tell you, I'm finding all this attention a bit overwhelming.
Oh, come on, you deserve it.
You're a hero.
Perhaps it's time we put all this into perspective.
The only real heroes are the fine athletes who worked so hard for two hours to win that game.
My contribution was minimal at best.
What did I tell you, doc?
Which of you won the game for us last night?
That would be me.
Nice talking to you too.
Enjoy the game.
Dad, it really isn't necessary to tell everyone we bump into  that I'm the one Reggie credited with last night's victory.
- That was you?
- Yeah, yeah, it's my son, Niles Crane.
They must've sold too many tickets.
They've stuck us in these folding chairs.
Wow, we're right on the hardwood, five feet from the baseline.
- Like front-row orchestra, stage right.
- Oh.
Oh, man, we're so close we're gonna hear teeth rattle when they set a pick.
It's like sitting close enough to get hit by Placido Domingo's spit.
Oh.
Hey, hey, N.C., you made it.
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, "N.C." I thought you said "nancy".
For a second it was prep school all over again.
Let me introduce.
Reggie MacLemore, Daphne Moon.
- Hello.
- And this Hi.
Marty Crane.
Niles' dad.
Yeah, I'm a big fan.
I want you to know, I never lost faith in you.
Not when you were in your slump, not when you tanked it in the playoffs, not even when all my friends were calling you Reggie Hack-Lemore.
What?
You know, this might be a good time to try that negative-thought-blocking exercise.
Yeah, okay.
Look, you guys enjoy the game.
I'll see you afterwards.
- All right.
Make me proud.
- Go Sonics.
- What the hell was that?
- That's the end of the shootaround.
The coach is about to send the starting five in for the tip-off.
- The stage manager just called places.
- Oh.
Foul on the rebound, MacLemore.
I gather Reggie's not performing up to par this evening.
Oh, you got that from all the booing, huh?
Nice counselling job.
He's been throwing up bricks all night.
Judging from that empty tureen of nachos and cheese, you may be joining him.
Malone to the line to shoot two.
Doc, you gotta help me out.
I don't know what's wrong.
Perhaps you've forgotten my advice.
Let's review quickly.
Did you empty your mind of negative thoughts?
- Yeah.
- The imaging exercises?
Yeah, yeah, I did them.
What else did you tell me to do?
Nothing.
Bulldog called you, you ran back in.
No, no, wait.
Now, right before that, I rubbed your head.
I remember because my hand smelled like peach and I thought, "What the hell does this guy wash his hair with"?
Well, you can't possibly think that my head is some sort of lucky charm.
Well, we'll know in a minute.
I saw you talking to Reggie again.
Hope you gave him some more advice.
I tried to, but he has this absurd idea No, wait, wait, wait.
MacLemore for three.
Unbelievable.
What did you say to him?
I didn't say anything he could possibly Look, look, look, he stole the ball.
MacLemore, three more.
Oh, Dr Crane, you're a miracle worker.
What did you say to him?
Oh, just something off the top of my head.
Timeout, Utah.
Oh, isn't this nice.
Dr Crane sent us a postcard from Aspen.
Great.
How's he doing?
Let's see.
"I delivered a speech at the conference last night.
I was especially pleased with my opening line: 'My fellow psychiatrists.
As I watched you on the slopes today, I realized I've never seen so many Freudians slip.
' As hard as you're laughing now, imagine the thunder of an auditorium of colleagues.
Well, see you Saturday.
Frasier".
Well, I better get going.
I'm meeting Joe at the movies.
Oh, bloody hell, it's later than I thought.
Enjoy.
- Yeah.
Enjoy your game.
Oh, Dr Crane, have fun at the game.
- I'm afraid we won't be going.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Do you wanna know why?
- Not really.
VIP parking.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's courtside, pal.
Yeah, right on the hardwood.
Yeah, swear to God.
And Reggie said the seats are ours for the rest of the season.
I believe it's what they call "living large".
I don't know.
Somewhere on TV.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Bye.
Let's go, Niles.
You know, Dad, I was thinking, maybe we shouldn't go to the game today.
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
Maybe we shouldn't go to any of them.
You know, that's one of the best things about this.
When was the last time you and I joked like this?
Well, we better get going, because it's late.
Last night at the game did you happen to notice when Reggie tousled my hair?
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
Well, somehow, some way, he's convinced himself that that's what he needs to do in order to play well.
Oh, well, can't we talk about it in the car?
It has nothing to do with any advice I've given.
It's all some bizarre superstition, and Reggie wants to rub my head again before today's game.
Well, you know, a lot of athletes have weird superstitions.
Yes, but I'm a psychiatrist.
I can't let people think I'm treating the man when all I am is a rabbit's foot.
I'd be taking credit for something I don't deserve.
Okay.
What would you be taking credit for?
Helping him.
What are you doing?
Helping him.
I'm getting my coat.
But I wouldn't be helping him as a psychiatrist.
Oh, that's what's bugging you?
People thinking you're a good psychiatrist?
- Exactly.
- Are you a good psychiatrist?
- Yes.
- I'm getting my coat.
Dad, Dad, I'm sorry.
We're not going.
Oh, man, I knew you'd find some way to ruin this.
Dad.
Courtside season tickets.
VIP parking.
Dad.
No, no, you've gotta have your reasons.
"It's my ethics.
It's my integrity.
It's my allergies".
Well, that's it.
I'm never getting my hopes up again.
Dad, you can still watch the game on TV.
I don't wanna watch it on TV.
- I'll get you a beer.
- I don't like beer.
Dad, you know I'm right.
Will you look me in the eye and answer me one question?
Would you still be doing this if these were courtside seats at the opera?
Yes.
My ethics are my ethics.
And by the way, where do you think I got those ethics?
Oh, yeah, throw it back at me.
That's real mature.
I'd like to talk to Mr MacLemore.
- Who wants to see him?
- Just tell him N.C. Is here.
Nancy?
No, N.C. What is so hard about that?
Damn, man, where've you been?
I gotta be on the court in five minutes.
I know, I know.
Stop.
Before you rub your hands all over me, we need to talk.
What's up?
- Well, I'll come right to the point.
This entire affair has grown out of control.
I need to end it.
What are you saying, you're not coming anymore?
Well, no.
We can still see each other to talk, but no touching.
That part of our relationship is over.
- Does this concern you?
- It's starting to.
- All right, come on, dude.
- No.
Now, listen.
Do you really expect me to drop what I'm doing and race down here every day just so you can run your fingers over my head?
Yeah.
Listen to me closely.
You are a gifted athlete with tremendous skill.
Marshal your talents.
Concentrate.
Focus.
The key to your success is to trust your own God-given ability.
It has nothing to do with my head.
- It must be your hair.
- Will you stop it.
- You're obsessing.
- Come on, man, just let me touch it.
No.
You have to look at this logically.
I can't come down here for every game, and I certainly can't go with you when the team is on tour.
This is not a long-term solution.
What you need is legitimate therapy.
If you wanna start, come inside.
I'll give you a quick session, we can proceed from there.
Yeah, you're right, doc.
I mean, what I need is a long-term solution.
Good.
Yo, Frank, let me see those scissors.
Coming, doc.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Oh, my God.
Breathtaking.
Well, don't be greedy.
Your turn was over 40 seconds ago.
All right, all right, Niles.
There it is.
It's the penthouse unit.
- Second window from the right.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh, mama.
You two know that what you're doing isn't right, don't you?
We're simply admiring a rare Brancusi armchair, not a naked woman.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Oh, hi, Daph.
- Hello, Daphne.
- You're home kind of early, aren't you?
A bit.
- Something sort of happened.
- Oh, yeah?
What?
Well, Joe and I were having dinner.
Everything was nice as could be, and I said, "Don't you like your potato"?
And he said, "No, I'm not hungry for potato just now".
I said, "If you don't like your potato, you're welcome to try my potato".
Daphne, could we hasten to the post-potato portion of the dialogue?
Well, that's when he said it.
He said we'd been on again, off again for too long without making anything permanent.
So maybe it was best if we just broke up.
Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry.
You're sure taking it well.
Boy, if you'd have told me that Joe would end up dumping you  Oh, God, he dumped me!
- Somebody comfort her.
- Right.
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Oh, no, no.
Never mind about that.
Expressing our feelings is always beneficial.
Even if it does come at the expense of our pride.
And a very expensive brand new Italian silk jacket.
I don't seem to be doing much good.
Why don't you give it a try?
Now, Daphne.
That's all right.
You're better off without him.
That guy was a bum.
He was the best thing in my life.
Then maybe you two just weren't meant for each other, you know.
You're a champagne-and-caviar sort of gal.
He's a meat-and-potatoes guy.
Potatoes.
- I'm messing up too.
- I've got it, Dad.
Here.
I'll get it.
- Hey, Daphne.
- Roz.
Oh, my God.
You got dumped.
Ahhh.
- Did you make her answer the door?
- It's what she does.
Oh, it's all right.
Come on.
- I'm sorry about this.
- It's all right.
I guess I'm still at the point where I can't hear his name without crying.
Did you hear that everyone?
No one mentions the name "Joe".
- Brandy, Niles?
- Yes, thank you.
- Frasier?
- Mm-hmm.
I think I've just made an important decision.
I'm going to tell Daphne how I feel about her.
- What?
- I'm gonna tell her tonight.
- You're serious?
- I am dead serious.
Maris and I are nowhere near reconciling.
I know this is the right decision because I'm completely calm about it.
Look.
- Perhaps I'll take that brandy.
- Yes, all right.
Niles, before you do something this rash, perhaps you should consider it from all angles.
I've spent three years considering Daphne from all angles.
I'm just not sure this is the right timing.
If you're trying to rattle me, it's not going to work.
I've been rehearsing for months.
Daphne, there's something I need to talk to you about.
It's a matter of Daphne, for a long time now, l You and l We Exactly how's the brandy getting here, by St Bernard?
Niles, I just think you should consider Daphne's state of mind.
I mean, she's still reeling from her break-up with Joe.
Listen, why don't you just give it one more day?
- A day?
- It's just a day.
Just one day, please.
I mean, you've waited this long.
Another day won't make a difference.
All right.
Now Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't that good and the sex wasn't that good, what have you really lost here?
Dr Roz weighs in with the Gabor approach to therapy.
What were the Sonics thinking last night?
If you're two for 15 behind the arc, why do you give it to your two guard instead of jamming it down to your big man in the paint?
Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you.
You know, if you took an interest in sports, I bet you'd end up enjoying it.
It's got drama, it's got graceful stuff.
Thank you, Dad, but I'm quite satisfied with the likes of Pavarotti's Pagliacci.
You have your big man in the paint.
I have mine.
- Niles.
- Frasier.
Either your boutonniere's way over the top, or you're here to execute last night's plan.
Look, I know I don't have your total support in this, - but how shall I put this?
- You don't care?
If you could work the phrase "rat's ass" into there, you'd have it.
The fact is, I'm tired of being lonely, and it makes no sense going on being lonely when the woman I long for is unattached.
Yes, well, as I said the time you tried to jump out of the tree house with an umbrella, "I suppose you know what you're doing".
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.
Hello.
Oh, just a second, please.
- Dad, is Daphne in her room?
- Gee, I don't know.
Daphne!
Hey, Daph!
Daphne!
For God's sake, I can yell!
Would you hold, please?
Been waiting 30 years to do that.
You're probably wondering what I'm doing with these flowers.
- Now that you mention it.
- Well, I'll tell you.
They're for Daphne.
I'm going to tell her how I feel about her.
- That's great, Niles.
- That's great?
- Well, yeah.
- You're single now.
She's single.
What's the problem?
- That's so funny.
- What is?
That's just not the reaction I expected.
I thought you'd say something more Dad-like, like - You're out of your mind?
- Exactly.
She's never gonna go for it in a million years.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Some day you'll look back on this as the stupidest I said stop it, Dad.
- Morning, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
Oh, don't you look nice.
Hello?
Yes, Rodney.
Well, I'm so glad you called.
Well, yes, I enjoyed meeting you too.
Uh-huh.
Well, that would be lovely.
I'll see you around 4 then.
Bye.
- Rodney?
Yes.
You won't believe this.
Last night, Roz insisted on taking me to this bar she calls the Sure Thing.
How flattering.
They've named a bar after her.
Well, she said whenever she takes a friend there, they always end up meeting someone.
Well, I wasn't there ten minutes when she spun my barstool around and I was face-to-face with this nice-looking man.
- Rodney?
- Right.
I suppose it's a bit soon for me to be seeing anyone else, but if I wait, he might not be available when I'm ready.
Timing is everything.
I can't wait to tell Roz.
"Give it a day, Niles".
I believe that was your brilliant advice.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I really am.
I don't know what to say.
Too bad you didn't have that problem last night.
Look, don't let it get you down.
I'm not going to.
I still have a fallback position.
I'm going to call Roz and have her take me to that bar tonight.
Niles, really.
A singles' bar?
Please, you're not thinking clearly.
It's not exactly your arena, is it?
Listen, why don't you just give it a day and think it Here, let me dial that for you.
Well, I'm here.
I forgot to gargle, I'm wearing mismatched socks and I'm so nervous I could wet myself.
Well, at least we have your opening line down.
You're going to have to be patient with me.
This isn't exactly my milieu.
Okay, let's make that lesson number one.
If you're going to use words like milieu, you might as well show up here with a sore on your lip and a couple of kids.
- Point well taken.
- Will you sit down and relax?
You're gonna be fine.
Just a few little rules you need to know.
First, when you introduce yourself, be as casual as possible.
Second, you cannot say enough nice things about her hair.
I know that sounds shallow, but it really works.
And third, hang on her every word.
Be fascinated.
Now go.
- What do you mean, go?
- It's time.
I'm not ready.
I've thrown a lot of babies in the water, and they've all come up swimming.
- Now go.
- No, no, I couldn't possibly, not yet.
- I have Hello.
- Hello.
Hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, not at all.
I'm Adelle.
- Niles.
So, Adelle, - is that one L or two?
- Two.
Really?
- You're wasting your time.
- No, I'm not.
You're not gonna win.
It's time he learned what it's like to be stared at all the time.
Bring it on, buster.
You got nothing.
You can't touch me.
I'm Oh!
It's like his eye turned into a sorcerer's pinwheels and started spinning.
Just shake hands and say "Good fight".
- Hey, Dad.
- How you doing?
Come on in.
Dad, this is Adelle Childs, my father, Martin.
- Nice to meet you.
- My brother, Frasier.
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
- You all right?
Your eyes look funny.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Oh, listen, here are your tickets.
- Thank you.
Say, have you got time for a coffee before you go?
- That'd be nice.
- Splendid.
It gives me a chance to debut my Limoges coffee set A series of six unique cups.
Each one representing a different wife of Henry Vlll.
My antique dealer just found an Anne of Cleves to complete the set.
He loves to rub it in.
I'm still looking for Wilma to complete my juice glass set.
I'll lend you a hand.
Excuse me.
- So, what do you think?
- She seems very nice.
She's fabulous.
It's know it's only been three dates, but I feel as though I've been rescued.
I no longer worry about becoming one of those pitiful losers embittered by a failed marriage, leading a lonely, pathetic life of fulfilment and good times.
Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that?
- Coffee will be ready in a moment.
- What were you two whispering about?
Nothing.
Just how whenever you think you have your life figured out, something unexpected happens.
Sorry.
Forgot my keys.
Hello, all.
Oh, everyone, this is Rodney Banks.
Oh.
Hello.
- Dr Niles Crane.
- How do you do?
The pleasure is mine.
- Flu season.
- Can't be too careful.
Oh, this is Dr Frasier Crane and his father, Martin.
- Good to see you.
Welcome.
- Hi, how are you?
This is Adelle Childs.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, we've just had the most wonderful day at the marina.
- Oh, you got a boat?
- Actually, no.
I have an inner ear curvature that makes me prone to motion sickness.
But there's a charming bistro there that serves the most  - It's not me.
- Not me.
Hello.
Oh, I can't talk now, Duke.
I'm in the Twilight Zone.
Would you like a coffee?
- Oh, yes, that would be lovely.
- I'll give you a hand, Frasier.
What the hell was that?
I think we should put a little red mark on the real Niles so we can tell them apart.
Niles must be going nuts.
- Can I lend you a hand?
- Oh, no, that's fine, Niles.
Oh, but wait, wait a minute.
So, what do you think of Rodney?
Bit of a pretentious fop, wouldn't you say?
- He doesn't remind you of anyone?
- Remind me of anyone?
So sorry, but about my coffee.
I neglected to mention that I like my milk steamed.
But just a dollop of foam, such as might give the effect of a cumulus cloud reflected in a still pond.
Consider it done.
I want to kill myself.
Come on, Niles, it's funny.
No, it's not remotely funny.
Frasier talked me out of approaching Daphne the night she fell for that man.
You can't possibly be mad at me.
No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful.
Come here.
- Let me show you how grateful I am.
- Niles, calm down.
- Isn't Rodney just great?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.
I think it was the moment I broke up with Joe when I heard a voice say, "Daphne, it's time you went for a completely new type of man".
- You're a dead man.
- I'll serve our guests their coffee.
Here we are.
Coffee.
Milk's on its way.
Niles is still steaming.
- Sugar?
- Nothing on earth smells quite so heavenly as a freshly brewed cup of coffee.
Well, perhaps one thing does.
Oh, stop that.
He loves to smell my hair.
- Anne Boleyn?
- Catherine of Aragon.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.
You don't take my calls, you ignore me.
For God's sake, it's the behaviour of a pouting adolescent.
Are you quite finished now?
You put gum on my chair, didn't you?
Yep.
Niles, listen.
I am terribly sorry if I steered you wrong.
But just think about it, you know.
You do have a wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she?
Yes.
Yes, she does.
Well, then if you've ever taken any of my advice before, take this.
Adelle could very well be the path to your happiness.
But let's just say I'm wrong.
But you're not wrong.
Adelle is a wonderful, affectionate woman.
She's clearly drawn to a man of my type.
Just thinking about her lifts my spirits.
Frasier, thank you.
Niles, look.
I don't believe it.
The betrayal.
- No one treats Daphne like that!
- Niles.
Whatever you do, do not engage him in a physical fight.
The whole thing would just look too weird.
Hello, Adelle.
- Oh, no.
- I know this may look a tad incriminating, but the Oh, spare me, you ludicrous popinjay.
I know exactly what's going on.
I saw the whole thing from my table.
I was gonna call you.
You see, Rodney and I - I'm sorry.
- So am I, Adelle.
But I'm mostly sorry for Daphne.
How do you intend to handle that small matter?
I was planning on telling her this evening at Granville's.
We're meeting for drinks.
Granville's.
Why don't you do her a favour?
Let me tell her.
- Might be better coming from a friend.
- Yes, perhaps you're right.
Please tell her that I'm sorry.
Sometimes when a man meets the woman that he's meant to be with, there's nothing he can do to resist it.
I hope Daphne understands that.
I hope she understands it too.
Rodney.
Adelle.
You know, there's just one thing I'd think I'd like to ask you, Rodney.
Do you have an older brother?
As a matter of fact, I do.
He's always been the pride of the family.
Handsome, successful, brilliant.
I've always been rather jealous of him.
Spooky.
- Evening, Daphne.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
You don't seem surprised to see me.
I was running late so I called Rodney on his cell phone.
- He told me everything.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for you too.
- Join me in a little sorrow-drowning?
- I believe I will.
One more of these, please.
Thank you.
Well, you know, I can't really blame Adelle.
Rodney's that sort of man that women seem to go for.
Yes, he is.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, you didn't.
I guess I'm just more in the mood to hear about his negative qualities right now.
Oh, well, he's kind of a know-it-all.
A bit fussy.
Has to have everything just so.
He's nuts about cleanliness.
Then there's his clothes, his precious shoes.
I don't like this road we're on.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if we discussed what's in our future?
I suppose.
I'll tell you one thing, after the run I've had lately, I pity the next man I date.
I'll probably rip him to shreds.
What about the man after that?
Men can be such an unfeeling lot.
Look at Rodney.
The minute he heard I'd broken up with someone, he moved in for the kill.
Is that how all men are?
No, not all men.
No, of course they aren't.
You're not.
You're kind, sensitive.
If you ask me, you were too good for that Adelle.
Thank you, Daphne.
You know, the truth is, my heart was never really in that relationship.
I thought it might not be.
There was someone else who was too much on my mind.
I had a feeling, Dr Crane.
- You did?
- Yes.
As long as you still have feelings for your wife, you know you can't be involved with anyone else.
And it makes sense to me.
Why, I know I'd never get involved with a man who was separated.
Even if he'd worshipped you from the day he laid eyes on you?
And don't think that's not just how they put it too.
No, I think I need to do a bit of separating myself.
From Joe, I mean.
Yes, I'll wait a good long time before I do any more dating.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah.
You know, it's funny when you think about it.
The two of us both coming to this same singles' bar this week.
You know, this was the very stool I was on when I met Rodney.
I was sitting here when I met Adelle.
- What?
- Oh, I was just thinking.
If it had been a different time in both our lives, we might actually have met.
Oh, how do you suppose that would have gone?
- What, our conversation?
- Yes.
Go on, just for fun.
We could both use a smile.
Well, I would've said, "Is this seat taken"?
And you would've said no.
And you would've said, "My name is Daphne".
And I would've said, "My name is Niles".
And then I would've said, "What are you doing for the rest of your life"?
You always know just the right thing to say.
Oh, I love you, Dr Crane.
I love you too, Daphne.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hello?
Yes, Buck, it's Dr Crane.
I'm calling to see if the cabin is ready for us.
Uh, You got the case of Montrachet?
Good.
Good.
And the Thanksgiving feast will be delivered promptly at 3?
Good.
The woodpile's been thoroughly inspected for spiders?
Excellent.
Thank you.
Well, we're ready to rough it in the great Northwest.
If you don't mind my asking, you taking anything along - to keep your nephew amused?
- Yes, his grandfather.
Oh, by the way, what time tomorrow are Frederick and Lilith flying in?
Her broom touches down at 11.
All right, now, when you mist the plants, be sure that the water is not too cold.
I know I'm harping on and on about this, but I know you're not used to dealing with delicate flowers.
I've produced your show for three years, haven't I?
I'll leave you a number at Niles' cabin in case anything goes wrong.
Oh, yes, and by the way, I frown on overnight guests.
Then you're not doing it right.
I'll leave you my number in San Francisco too.
You're not going to the cabin with them?
Daphne's decided to spend a traditional Thanksgiving with her transvestite uncle, Jackie.
Come on, Roz, I'll show you around the kitchen.
So this uncle of yours, does he dress like a woman all the time?
Oh, certainly not for work.
His congregation would never stand for it.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, just a little depressed.
This is my first Thanksgiving without Maris.
Oh, yeah.
I know, son, it's hard.
Remember the year I plopped that big wedge of pumpkin pie in front of her, and we all laughed?
Then I put a big scoop of whipped cream on top of it, and we laughed some more.
Then her eyes welled up with tears, and we all knew it was time to stop.
Yes.
If it makes you feel any better, I won't be having my dream Thanksgiving either.
Why does Lilith have to tag along anyway?
She didn't wanna spend the holiday alone.
Her husband is in New Zealand, exploring a volcano.
- Why couldn't she go with him?
- Because if she accidentally fell in, the shock wave from the hottest thing in nature meeting the coldest would actually crack the Earth in two.
As if a smile from Maris couldn't freeze Mercury.
Guys, let it go.
Nobody's gonna win this one.
Hello?
Yes, Lilith.
Yes, Lilith.
- Yes, Lilith.
- Gee, it's like they were still married.
If you change the paper towels, he likes the flap facing the front.
If you change the bathroom tissue, the flap faces the back.
Don't ask me why.
- Don't know how you live with him.
- Don't know how you work with him.
Well, I have learned a trick.
When he's really bugging me, I ask if he hasn't lost a little weight.
Before you know it, he's checking his butt out in the glass at the candy machine.
Really?
I tell him he's gained weight.
He skips dinner, sulks in his room, and I have the whole evening to myself.
Oh, good.
Okay, you tell Frederick I said bravo.
Frederick just passed the qualifying exam for the Marbury Academy!
Huzzah!
What is that, some school?
Some school?
That's He doesn't  Oh, Dad.
Oh, Dad, please.
No, the Marbury Academy is the most exclusive private school in all of Boston.
It's a breeding ground of power and privilege.
Lilith and I have to be interviewed by the headmaster.
He's got a busy schedule.
He has agreed to see us Thanksgiving.
This, of course, changes our plans.
Wait.
You mean I don't get to see my grandson?
Of course you do.
We'll move our Thanksgiving celebration to Boston.
- I'll call the airline.
- I'd better cancel our rustic Thanksgiving.
Hello, Buck, it's Dr Crane.
Take the mints off the pillows.
Frederick, your father is here.
- Dad!
Hey, Frederick!
Good to see you.
Good boy.
- Hi, Lilith, how you doing?
- Happy Thanksgiving, Lilith.
Martin.
Niles.
Nice neighbourhood.
I noticed a whole bunch of kids Freddie's age - playing in the street.
- Yes.
He's spent many happy hours at his window observing their play patterns.
Niles, I'm afraid, with this interview, I'm running a little behind schedule, so I'm enlisting you to help with the turkey.
Oh, well, I've never cooked a turkey before, but the recipe's here.
I guess I can fumble my way through.
How far along are you?
I'm nearly done defrosting.
And the turkey?
Might I suggest you stuff it?
So the rabbit says to the bear, "No, no.
I said, 'Oedipal' not 'edible".
' Good one, Dad.
- Hello, Lilith.
- You're late.
Oh, well, happy Thanksgiving to you too.
Well, there, Frederick.
Now, Mommy and Daddy have to run off to this meeting.
After that, I'm all yours.
Meanwhile, why don't you head on upstairs and show Granddad and Niles your new computer?
Okay.
Come on, sport.
My God, are you half as nervous as I am?
- And then some.
- We have got to master our nerves.
It is vital that we appear to be well-adjusted, responsible parents.
Lilith, do you still keep the Valium with the contraceptives?
Sorry, I needed the last one just to go in and pick up the application.
I'll assume you meant the Valium.
Perhaps before the interview you should sheathe that butter-knife-sharp wit of yours.
Perhaps we could find the appropriate kitchen tool to ratchet down that bun of yours a notch or two.
Frasier, stop.
We should be focusing on our son.
You're right, of course.
We've always had our differences, but we've put them aside for the welfare of Frederick.
This may be the most important thing we ever do to ensure his happiness.
Not counting our divorce.
Freddie's gonna break in this new mitt I bought him.
Frederick doesn't play ball.
He was just about to watch Pocahontas and write a satiric essay on the historical inaccuracies.
Well, we're off.
Now, wait.
Where do you keep your saffron?
- Third cupboard.
- Um-hmm.
Where are your shallots?
In the crisper.
By the way, you still have to remove the entrails from the chest cavity.
In that case, where do you keep your ten-foot pole?
All right, Mommy and Daddy are going to see that you're wearing a Marbury blazer, or die trying.
Dad, maybe you should remove the entrails.
No can do.
Freddie and I are gonna play catch.
Mother says balls are for the slow children.
Yeah?
Well, Grandpa's in charge now.
You're gonna love baseball.
It's easy as riding a bike.
- Mother says bikes are - Yeah, I know.
I know.
- Dr Campbell.
- Dr Sternin.
- Dr Campbell.
- Dr Crane.
Please come in.
- You have a lovely home.
- Yes.
Thank you so much for seeing us today.
You're welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll get coffee.
Thank you.
I think that went rather well, don't you?
So far, so good.
Oh, my God, we have just got to get Frederick into this school.
I am so nervous.
I feel as though all the colour has drained from my face.
- How is my makeup?
- Well, you could use a pinch.
- Oh, do I have time?
- No, no, no, you can use a pinch.
Thank you.
- Oh, oh, Lord.
Oh, oh, dear.
- What?
Oh, well, I, uh I just reached down to pull a thread off what I thought was on my jacket.
It seems it's attached to this cushion.
Oh, Lord.
Look, now this little bird has no beak.
- Stop doing that.
- I, um Give me your nail clippers.
- I didn't bring them.
Just bite it off.
- All right.
- Does either of you take cream?
- Yes.
Yes, thank you.
Then let me begin by saying that the child who fills this opening need not worry for the future.
"Opening"?
There's only one?
Yes.
Well, children of alumni and certain generous benefactors are, of course, given preference.
- Of course.
- Of course.
Now regarding your Frederick, his scores, of course, are excellent, and I have no doubt he is being courted by other prestigious schools.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, that goes without saying.
Still, we like to think that we are a cut above.
Our sixth-grade talent show just spawned a highly successful cast album.
Frederick has perfect pitch.
Yes, we often use him to tune the piano.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Senator Geiger.
I thought I'd made it perfectly plain that you'd be notified by mail.
Well, senator, rules may not mean anything on Capitol Hill, but they still mean something to me.
And that is why young Noah will be seeking his education elsewhere.
Do I sound flexible?
Marbury thanks you for your interest.
- Frasier, your coffee.
- Oh, yes, please be careful.
Those chairs have been in the family for three generations.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, it's not so bad.
- You hardly notice it.
Uh -oh.
- I lost my MedicAlert bracelet.
- Oh, maybe it fell off - when we were playing catch.
- I'll go look.
All right.
I still don't know how it happened.
I lobbed it right to him.
When will you learn?
The only thing the Crane boys are skilled at catching is sarcastic nuance and the occasional virus.
Let's make a pact that as long as we're guests of Lilith's, we'll avoid all activities that could possibly harm Frederick.
Where are those pie crusts?
Found it.
I taste blood.
- Now you've done it.
- My God, Frederick, I am so sorry.
Squeeze right up here.
There.
It's them.
Hey, pal, why don't we go find some cotton upstairs - for that thing, huh?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- How will I explain this to Lilith?
- How did you give Maris bad news?
Usually by breaking a tranquillizer into her Slim-Fast.
Did you notice how those patrician eyebrows of his arched when you mentioned Frederick's National Science Award?
Yes.
- I take it Dr Campbell was favourably impressed?
- Ohhh.
- We had an initial bout of nervousness, but after that, we did an absolute bang-up job.
Speaking of bang-up jobs You know, Lilith, there's just one question - I wish we'd answered differently.
- Which one?
Remember, he mentioned Frederick was being courted by other schools?
I wonder if we shouldn't have made it clear that Marbury is far and away our first choice.
Frasier, if you overanalyse every detail, you will rob us of the joy of the moment.
It will be our wedding night all over again.
Speaking of hard-to-explain bruises Yes, well, you're right.
You're right, of course.
I'm sure everything's fine.
Unless we didn't convey to him how highly we regard Marbury.
Well, see, that is my worry.
We must correct this.
What should I say?
Oh, Lilith, stop!
Stop!
Remember what happened when the senator called?
- We need We need a ruse.
You're right.
How's this?
We go back, and I say that I lost my earring in his living room.
While looking for it, we casually mention that Marbury is Frederick's first and only choice.
- Perfect.
- Let's go.
Speaking of dumb-ass ideas  Ah, yes, Dr Campbell, I hope we're not disturbing anything important.
Actually, I'm a bit frazzled trying to get my Thanksgiving dinner together.
I'm afraid I lost an earring here this morning.
Well, I'll have a look around and call you if it turns up.
- Well, um - Uh, do you think I might be able to take a peek right now?
I wouldn't even think of asking, but it was a treasured gift from Golda Meir.
- Very well.
- Thank you.
Forgive me, I must turn the heat down on the pumpkin soup.
We rehearsed everything we were going to say on the ride over.
Where the hell did Golda Meir come from?
I admit it wasn't half as clever as "um".
- But it got us in.
- Mm-hmm.
- Any luck?
- Not yet.
We're so sorry about this.
The whole ride over here we kept saying: "Why did this have to happen at the only school that matters to us"?
Yes, as you know, Marbury is our first choice.
Oh, look, here it is.
- That was lucky.
- Remarkably so.
Considering that wasn't the chair you were sitting in.
- Um - Well, I suppose it's time we be shoving off.
I'm curious.
I've always been a great admirer of Mrs Meir.
How did you meet?
Oh, well, it's a funny story.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Frasier, you tell it much better than I do.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It was back in college days.
Lilith spent a summer at a kibbutz and was dating her grandson, Oscar.
That would be Oscar Meir?
Yes.
Well, just imagine the ribbing he took.
Indeed.
Well, it's so good to see you both again.
Enjoy your Thanksgiving.
Marbury thanks you for your interest.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
"Marbury thanks you for your interest".
- We know what that means.
- Oh, good.
Then you'll have no trouble interpreting this.
You had to give him gum, didn't you?
Not just gum, bubble gum.
Maybe what threw him off is having to breathe through his mouth while he chewed it.
You know, Frederick, when I was a boy nothing brought a smile to my face like when Mother would make a rëmoulade and let me lick the spoon.
- Thanks, Uncle Niles.
- You're welcome.
You think maybe I should trim his bangs a little bit?
Maybe you should put the scissors down while he still has one good eye.
Uh-oh.
- Is there anchovies in this?
- Yes.
Oh, my God, I've never seen hives break out that fast.
- They're back!
- Freddie, you got any pills for this?
I got pills for everything.
Of all the names in the universe, you had to pick "Oscar".
You started us down that path of insanity.
Golda Meir.
Golda my ass!
This sniping is pointless.
Getting into Marbury was a long shot anyway.
You heard the man.
Most of these openings go to children of alumni and generous benefactors.
Yes, yes.
Wait a minute.
Oh, my God, we're such fools.
See what he was trying to tell us?
He was trying to give us the way to get Frederick accepted.
Are you saying he was fishing for a donation?
So you think he was just trying to see if we were willing to pay our fair share?
What else?
- Hi, Daddy.
- In a minute, Frederick.
God, it was right in front of us, and we missed it.
- We didn't even see it.
- How could we be so blind?
Maybe we should get ourselves back there and give him what he wants.
Right.
We can't let anything stand in the way of our son's welfare.
- Mother.
- Mother has to run, munchkin.
Go play with Grandpa.
Ah, Dr Sternin and Dr Crane.
Forgive me if I don't give you a big hello hug, but as you can see, I'm wearing this greasy apron.
On top of which, I'm beginning to loathe the sight of both of you.
All the more reason for us to be brief.
Yes, I'm sure you'll be on your way just as soon as you've found the cufflink given to you by Haile Selassie.
No false pretence this time.
We know that with so many qualified applicants and only one position open that your decision must be very difficult.
Yes.
And so, in the spirit of the holidays, like Indians to your Pilgrims' table, we bring this little bit of garnish, as it were, in the hopes that our relationship may flower.
I'll have you know that, in 22 years, I have never accepted a bribe.
I have to tell you that I find this utterly offensive in every possible way.
Now, if you don't mind, I have guests on the way and a turkey so undercooked a skilled veterinarian could still save him.
- But, Dr Campbell - Unless the rest of that sentence is: "I have a fully cooked turkey" in the breast pocket of that blazer, I'm afraid our conversation is at an end.
Muah!
This is indeed a very special holiday for us all.
Pamela, Cynthia, I'm particularly grateful that finally you've been able to set aside your differences and join us in this Thanksgiving tortellini.
Well, as angry as I was that you admitted Regan into Marbury instead of our Wesley, it's all worked out for the best.
Wesley is thriving at the Barkley School.
I'm delighted to hear it.
Oh, I have a dusty bottle of Chateau Lafitte in the cellar waiting for an occasion like this.
Well This is nice.
Yes, it is.
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
- Hello.
- Hello, is Dr Campbell in?
Yes, he's just gone to the cellar to get a bottle of wine.
Don't mean to intrude, but we heard he was having trouble with his turkey, thought we'd drop this by.
Oh, how very generous of you.
Please, come in.
- Oh, thank you.
- Look, everyone, friends of Colin's - have brought us a turkey.
- Well, I think "friends" is probably stretching it just a tad.
You see, our son was a candidate for Marbury, and in our zeal to see him accepted, we may have come on a bit strongly.
Yes.
Well, I mean, I'm sure you understand, as parents yourselves.
It's only natural to wish the very best for your son.
- Oh, absolutely.
- There are other good schools.
- Barkley is excellent.
- Yes.
Well, thank you very much for trying to cheer us up.
But I mean, really, if you're looking for a filet mignon, you can hardly swallow ground chuck.
Now, now.
Barkley is a very charming little school.
- "Little school"?
- Now, don't be so sensitive.
- Damn your condescension.
- Damn your jealousy!
- Don't talk to my wife that way!
- Oh, shut up, Elliot.
Don't you talk to my husband that way!
Quiet!
We brought a turkey.
I don't know how this started.
I can only be sure it started with the two of you.
- Actually, we - I will die a happy man if I never set eyes on either of you again.
Unfortunately, there's only one way I can think of to ensure that.
Your son Frederick is hereby admitted to the Marbury School.
However, he will be immediately expelled if either of you violates any of the following conditions: You will not bring him to school.
You will not collect him.
You will not attend any recitals, plays, sporting events or school functions up to and including Frederick Crane Day, should we ever have one.
And when graduation comes, you will dispatch an appropriate envoy with a video camera.
And now it is with great pleasure - that I bid you goodbye forever.
- Allow me.
We're in.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Look, we had an agreement.
We went to a movie I wanted to see, so I was supposed to pay for the ticket.
Very well, Dad.
The next time we go to a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, not only may you pay for the tickets, but also for the wild horses it will take to drag me there.
Well, I'm only mad because we had an agreement.
Now, a man's supposed to honour his agreements.
Didn't you learn anything from that movie?
Only that bullets are useless against a man who can kick really high.
Now, look, I'm serious about this.
Once in a while, I'd like to pay.
- Okay.
-  Okay.
So the next time we go anywhere, it's on me.
Have I made my point?
Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety that Mr Van Damme displayed when he jet-packed into the Vatican to subdue that nasty old pope impostor.
Like you saw that coming.
Well, Maris has finally deigned to call me back, after I've left no fewer than 20 messages.
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many times, you give her all the power.
You're much better off coming from a position of strength.
Don't pour that sherry on your shirt.
It will stain.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I thought this was the portion of the afternoon where we gave each other patently obvious advice.
I had to call Maris for that party I'm throwing for my country club friends.
Oh, yes, the one I wasn't invited to but my Waterford punchbowl was.
Yes, well, Maris has chosen the same night to throw a party of her own.
- Couldn't you ask her to postpone?
- I tried.
She's already flown in a sculptor from Sweden to capture her likeness in ice.
Ah, the perfect marriage of subject and medium.
Well, you can see my problem.
We're going to be competing now for which friends go to which party.
You know, Niles, for a separated couple still hoping to reconcile, I'm afraid you're going down a path that You shouldn't wear that tie with that jacket.
Oh, is that your clever way of telling me I'm dispensing unwanted criticism?
That too.
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Daphne.
Oh, Dr Crane.
Will you be joining us for dinner?
- What a nice invitation.
I'd love to.
- Well, then, you're in for a treat.
I've decided to make Grammy Moon's famous sheep's head stew.
Oh, don't worry, the name's a bit misleading.
It's actually more of a soup.
You actually use a real sheep's head?
- Oh, you have to.
It's right in here.
- Oh, my God!
I just remembered, we have reservations at Le Cigare Volant!
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Gee, is that tonight?
I nearly forgot.
- You're going too, Mr Crane?
- Well, I promised the boys.
I don't suppose there's any way you guys would let me out of this.
- Well - You promised.
See, I tried.
Well, have fun.
I'm off to stick my head in the oven.
Hello?
Marshall?
Yeah, I got rid of them.
You bring some wine, and I'll throw the steaks on.
Oh, dear Lord, it's rather busy.
Well, let's keep our fingers crossed.
- Francois!
- Dr Crane, bonsoir!
Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
This is our father, Martin Crane.
- Monsieur Crane!
- How you doing?
Enchante.
Francois, I'm afraid we're at your mercy tonight.
You see, we have no reservations.
- Dr Crane, I will see what I can do.
- Thank you.
Anything would be just fine.
Thank you.
You know, come to think of it, we haven't been here since Chef Joachim had his pinkie grafted back on.
Oh, then this is your first time seeing our new artwork.
He's my own discovery.
His name is Cordoba.
- Exquisite!
- Stunning!
My God, I don't think I've ever seen such fearless use of colour.
You know, as usual, your taste is as fine as your cuisine.
Any luck?
For you, yes.
For Dr Dubin, who brings his own wine, no.
- Good man!
- Monsieur, follow me, please.
- Merci bien.
- Your table is ready.
- Thank you.
- You guys go ahead.
I gotta make a little visit to "le can".
- That's our father.
- Doctor.
- Le menu.
- Merci.
- I will be back with the wine list.
- Lovely.
Wine list?
My God, he ought to bring us blindfolds.
I mean, what is he thinking with this artwork?
It's appalling.
Who was it that said, "Art in restaurants is on the same level with food in museums"?
The little white lies one will tell for a good table, huh?
Of course, I would compliment a black velvet Elvis right now if Chef Joachim's lobster comfit were at stake.
Frasier, that's Winship Cook.
She's one of the guests Maris and I are competing over.
I'm going to go woo her.
Oh, really, Niles, why don't you just reschedule your party?
I don't want to give her the satisfaction.
She's pushed me around long enough.
- All right.
- Metaphorically.
In reality, she can hardly push at all.
Hence, that terrible afternoon last spring she spent trapped in the revolving door at Bergdorf's.
I hope there's something on there you like because dinner's on me tonight.
- What do you mean, Dad?
- We had an agreement.
- Next time we went out, it's my treat.
- Well, Dad, when I said that - Hup, We're not discussing it.
- Yes, but Dad, it's rather pricey.
- Hup, you promised.
- Well, l I just don't - Hup!
- All right.
All right.
You treat.
Thank you.
Now, don't worry about it.
Just order whatever you want.
Is this per person?
The wine list, uh, doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you, Francois, but, you know what, we won't be having any wine tonight.
And I'm going out for a Big Mac after work.
No, I'm really being quite serious.
You see, my brother and I are watching our caloric intake tonight.
We'll be eating light.
As you wish, doctor.
I know what you're doing.
I'm not stupid.
- What are you talking about?
- Eating light?
All the way here you had the look that Eddie gets when he hears a can-opener.
Look, Dad, it's just that I'm not that comfortable ordering an expensive meal when you're paying.
What's the big deal?
You take me to places like this.
I can afford it!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.
You're always paying, and I'm never allowed to pay.
Well, it feels pretty lousy.
- Go ahead, Mr Big Shot, you pay.
- Dad Well, the good news is Winship has agreed to come to my party.
Bad news is I left my wallet at home, so, Frasier, I'm afraid this is on you.
- Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad.
- No, you ruined it.
I'm not paying.
- Well, I'm not paying!
- Well, I can't pay.
So that would be three Happy Meals to go?
No, he never suspected a thing.
Yes, I had a great time too.
Oh, go on, Marshall, say it again.
Now say it how you said it last night, like Donald Duck.
Well, I guess it was the wine that made it funny.
They're back.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
- Hello.
-  Oh, hello, Daphne.
Will you be favouring us with any English delicacies?
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
The butcher had some lovely calf stomachs, so I'll try my hand at haggis.
Even Hannibal Lecter couldn't keep that woman's cooking down.
Hello.
Ah, Winship, so looking forward to seeing you at the party.
Oh, how dreadful.
Oh, you poor thing.
No, no, of course I understand.
The important thing is that you get better.
And you are a dear for calling.
You lying, two-faced cow!
- So she's not really sick?
- Oh, hardly.
Maris is luring away all my confirmed guests.
Suddenly there are accidents, deaths in the family, a wave of misfortune is sweeping through society's bluebloods at a rate unprecedented since the French Revolution.
Oh, great, you're back!
Hey, listen, about last night at the restaurant, I'm really sorry.
Oh, no, Dad, look, it was my fault.
I should've been more gracious.
No, no, it was my fault.
I was the one who overreacted.
You know, I just really wanted to do something nice for you.
You know, the older you get, the harder it is to do stuff for your kids.
I understand.
I tell you what, the next three dinners, they're on you.
No, no, no.
I found something better than that.
I finally found something I know you're gonna like.
Now, just a minute.
Oh, this is gonna be so great!
My God, I haven't seen him this excited since he got that four-in-one remote control.
It's a Cordoba.
Ole!
You guys were raving about these paintings last night, so I went to the restaurant to find out where they got theirs.
And lucky me, the ones they had were for sale!
Oh, Dad, this is awfully awfully - Expensive.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, but it's worth it.
You know, you don't know how good this makes me feel.
After I'm gone, this'll still be here.
Hey, Daph, come here!
Take a look at this.
Well, I'm very impressed, Mr Crane.
When did you have the time to do that?
Oh, sure, like I could paint something like this.
You know, I was thinking maybe we could put it over the fireplace.
Yes, yes, the fireplace.
That's the first place I thought of too.
And lately I've had the chronic fluctuating mood disturbances that would indicate cyclothymic disorder.
I mean, the hypomanic symptoms are there, yet I've experienced moments of aphasia and apraxia.
And I just wanna pull my teeth out, Dr Crane.
What do you think?
Well, Greg, two possible diagnoses come to mind: Either you are seriously mentally ill and you should be institutionalized immediately, or you are a first-year psychology student.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm at UW.
Yes, it's not uncommon for students to feel that they're manifesting symptoms that they are studying.
It'll pass.
- What'll I do till it passes?
- Oh, just relax.
Well, it might be a good idea to postpone reading about male sexual disorder until after spring break.
That's all the time we have.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL-780.
- Good show.
- Well, thanks, Roz.
Say, Roz, if you're not busy, would you like to get a drink or something?
You know, maybe see a movie?
You pick, I'll pay.
You can stay out as late as you want, but eventually you have to go home, and that painting will still be there.
- You have to tell him.
- I can't, Roz.
You didn't see the look on his face when he gave it to me.
Frasier, have I ever told you about my ceramic hippo collection?
- Oh, yes.
Many times.
- The hell I have.
Shut up and listen.
One Christmas my grandma sent me a ceramic hippo.
Roz, a hippo cannot possibly be as repellent as a rabid matador killing an epileptic bull.
Was the bull wearing a porkpie hat and fishing off a dock?
- Continue.
- Okay.
I made the mistake of telling her how much I loved it.
Well, that just opened the floodgates.
I got ice-skating hippos and hula-hooping hippos.
Thank God for that earthquake!
Oh, you mean, you mean they broke?
Well, I assume they did when they hit the bottom of the garbage chute.
But I blamed it on the earthquake.
The point is you need to talk to your father now and be honest with him.
Or you'll be stuck with it till the next natural disaster.
Hell, you're right, Roz.
I guess I'll just have to tell him this afternoon.
Good.
Oh, Roz, that crystal vase I gave you three years ago for Christmas, you said that was broken in the earthquake.
Oh, no, no, no, that really was.
I was very disappointed.
As disappointed as you were when Eddie chewed up that sweater I gave you for Christmas.
- This year, liquor?
- Deal.
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.
You know, I was just down in the storage room putting away some boxes.
Guess what I came across.
That That smoking jacket I gave you for Christmas last year.
- The shiny one?
- Not shiny, Dad, silk.
I really I really missed the boat on that one, didn't I?
You know, it's just, buying things for other people, - it's so hard sometimes, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Hey, you want some pastrami?
There's some more in the fridge.
No, thanks, Dad.
I don't really care for pastrami.
Isn't that funny, you know, you can love something so much, and I would find it distasteful.
- People have different tastes.
- Yeah.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Some people like pastrami, like me, other people don't.
They're nuts.
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Niles.
- Hi, Niles.
- Dad, Frasier, I'm here to pick up the punchbowl for my party.
Although at this point, a soup bowl might suffice.
Thanks to Maris, I'm down to three confirmed guests.
Three?
Yesterday it was 12, wasn't it?
She's circulating a vicious rumour that I'm going to have a karaoke machine.
You know, this vindictive behaviour of Maris' is completely out of line.
If you don't want her to continue with it, you should call her on the phone and confront her.
You're absolutely right.
It's time I took the bull by the horns.
Sorry.
Maris?
Niles.
You may feel you've triumphed, but all you've done is shown yourself to be petty and uncivil.
Frankly, the only people lower than you are the fickle paramecia that deserted my party to attend yours.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I see.
Very well.
Yes.
I'll see you at 8.
Can I bring anything?
Thank God for the starch in that shirt, or there'd be nothing holding you upright.
Hey, Niles.
Here.
- Well, what's that?
- It's a wine rack.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I felt kind of bad about giving Frasier something and nothing for you, so I saw it at Price Busters.
Well, thank you for the thought, Dad, but it doesn't really fit in with the decor of my apartment.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Well, no harm done.
I'll take it back.
- Anybody want a beer?
- No, thanks.
No, thanks, Dad.
Frasier, I no longer require your punchbowl, but may I borrow your blow dryer?
Of course.
Why?
Sven finished Maris' ice sculpture, and she's convinced she looks a bit hippy.
Dad?
Are you sure Niles didn't just hurt your feelings now?
No.
I'm glad he told me.
I don't wanna give him something he doesn't like.
That's very wise.
You know, it's important for fathers and sons to be honest with each other.
It shows respect.
You know, I've been thinking, Dad, about the painting.
You know, art, it's such a personal thing.
What one person may like, another may not.
It doesn't mean that one is right and the other is wrong.
You telling me you don't like the painting?
Well, it's not that I don't like it, it's just I don't love it.
It's not me.
Not a problem.
You don't like it, I'll take it back.
Oh, thank God, Dad, thank you.
That's such a relief.
You know, I was up half the night worried about it, and I just Dad, are you all right?
Well, I didn't upset you, did I?
My God, Dad, are you crying?
No, no.
Yes, you are!
Yes, you are!
I just saw you wipe your eyes.
No, I didn't.
I just Quit looking at me!
Dad!
Oh, my God!
- I've made my father cry.
- Now, don't you start!
Oh, God, I'm only crying because you're crying.
I'm not crying!
I don't know what this is.
I didn't even cry when I got shot.
I didn't cry when you got shot, either.
I'm getting rid of that damn painting right now.
I just wish I knew why you told the waiter you loved it so much.
- I was lying to him!
- Oh, you can lie to him, - but you can't lie to me?
!
- Please, please stop crying.
- I wanna keep it now.
- No, it's no good.
No, no, it is good.
It's very good.
I love it!
Well, I found that Dad, are you crying?
Frasier, what happened?
Oh, my God, you're crying too.
Why is everybody crying?
You know how I get when other people cry.
Tell me what happened.
I made our father cry.
I'm not crying!
Well, I am!
- I'm the most ungrateful son there is.
- I can never do anything for my sons.
No one wants to come to my party!
Dad?
Frasier.
Don't you think we ought to talk about what happened?
Nothing happened this afternoon.
Look, Dad, I know you're disappointed about the painting.
It's not a problem.
Well, look, you said yourself that it wasn't as easy for you to give me things as it was when I was a kid.
I wasn't very good at it then either.
Your mother always picked all your stuff out.
Still, you did put a roof over my head, sent me to school All right, all right.
You wanna talk about this?
We'll talk about it.
Do people come to you after they've met me and say, "How can that guy be your father, he's nothing like you"?
Well Because they've been saying that to me about you for the last 40 years.
I just thought, I don't know, that I'd finally given you something, something you liked, something we both liked.
Like we had something in common or something.
It's no big deal.
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.
Dad, Dad, just hang on a second, will you?
Do you remember a time when I was, oh, 6 or 7 years old?
You were getting ready for work, and you were getting dressed, and I was playing with your badge?
And you sat me down and you said that it was not a toy.
That it was a symbol of something very important of integrity and honesty and helping people.
Well, from then on, every time I'd see you put on that badge, I would, I would think of that.
I said it so you'd stop playing with the thing.
You were getting it all sticky.
Yeah, well, be that as it may.
I've tried to live up to your example, and help other people.
I've tried as a psychiatrist to conduct myself with the integrity that you showed as a police officer.
And when I find myself in a quandary as to the proper course of action, I think of you wearing that badge, and then I know what I have to do.
You gave me that.
Yeah?
Yeah, Dad.
Thanks.
You know, I think I may have something else to give you, something that I know you'll really like.
I'll be back in a minute.
I've been holding on to this for quite a while now, waiting for the right time.
Oh, my goodness, Dad.
I'm speechless.
It's your ba Bolo tie!
They gave it to your grandfather when he retired from the force.
When I graduated from the academy, he gave it to me, and now I'm giving it to you, and someday you'll give it to Frederick.
Well, I don't know what to say.
- You're not gonna start crying again.
- No, no, no.
It's just a surprise, that's all.
Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't think I was gonna give you my badge, did you?
- Well, l - My badge?
!
That's a laugh!
You'll have to pry that out of my cold, dead hands!
It's a date!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
It sure - Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.
- Maureen.
- Hi, Niles.
A, uh, nonfat cap, please.
- I'll pay for his too.
- Well, thank you.
My day started off with good news, and it's already getting better.
To what do I owe this largesse?
Well, I'm having a pretty great day too.
See, a few months ago, I took my first tennis lesson And you've finally mastered the backhand.
No, I haven't played since.
But the guy who was teaching me Has won your girlish heart.
No, he was a loser.
But that day, he hit me this little dink shot, and I ran for it, and I stubbed my toe.
I got this big black toenail that lasted for, like, three months, and today it finally fell off.
I can wear sandals again.
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Goodbye, Maureen.
- And good luck.
- Thanks.
- Frasier, may I borrow your spoon?
- Certainly.
I have an announcement.
You know, frankly, so do I. Dad's girlfriend just told me some very big news.
Well, unless she's expecting our baby brother, my news takes precedence.
- She's not, is she?
- No, no.
Guess who just won this year's Mariott Fassbinder Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Literature of Psychiatry.
Judging from the canary feathers protruding from your mouth, - I'd say you.
- Yes.
What article did you win for?
A gripping case history of a narcissistic opera singer.
I called it, "Me Me Me Me Me".
- It's very clever.
I like that.
- Yes.
Thrilled as I am, I must admit I'm a tad nervous about the awards banquet.
- Why?
- Dad.
I want him there, of course, but I'm just dreading a rerun of Aunt Vi's wedding.
Yes, the hour he spent regaling the table with "Little Niles" stories.
Exactly.
Imagine an entire roomful of trained psychiatrists hearing the story of Sheldon, my imaginary protëgë.
Oh, yes, Sheldon.
That troubled little fellow who kept wetting your bed.
Well, you know, if you're thinking of excluding Dad from the event, your timing couldn't be worse.
It's his birthday this weekend.
Oh, right.
On top of that, Maureen just told me that she's decided to break it off with him.
- No.
- Yes.
Oh, dear.
What?
Is it the age difference?
No, no, she was quite emphatic on that point.
She just thinks they have nothing in common.
Oh, poor Dad.
I know how much he enjoyed going out with her.
Yes, just the other day he was saying that between her police badge and his handicap sticker, they could park anywhere.
Evening, Dr Crane.
Daphne, thank God you're home first.
Listen, I have to warn you.
- About what?
- Dad and Maureen are on a date.
It's not going well.
She's telling him that she wants to break it off.
Oh, this vision you're getting, is it a tingly feeling and a picture in your head, or more like a husky voice murmuring in your ear?
It's not a vision.
Maureen told me about this this afternoon.
Just worried about Dad.
We have to help him through this.
I wouldn't worry about your father.
People are more resilient than you think.
You know, when Joe dumped me a few weeks ago, I thought I'd lost the love of me life.
I figured I'd spend the rest of my years dwelling on what might have been.
The home we'd have made, the children running through it, growing old together.
Did I mention Joe's getting married?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm all right.
Oh, Daphne.
Daphne.
That'll be fine.
I should've known that you'd hate Indian food.
No, it was great.
I just You know, it just takes a little getting used to.
Yeah, it does.
You should try it again sometime.
I think I just did.
So are you gonna come in for some coffee?
No, you're not feeling too well.
I think I'll just call it a night.
I thought you said there was something you wanted to talk about.
It can wait.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
How was your date?
Awful.
I never felt this bad in my life.
- Oh, Dad.
- Yeah.
I feel like my guts have been ripped out.
Dad, let me assure you this has nothing to do with your age.
The hell it doesn't.
This never would've happened 20 years ago.
Well, you know, Dad, I may be talking out of turn here, but Maureen told me about this.
- What?
- Yes.
Yes, she came to me for advice.
That's how determined she was not to hurt you.
You see she wanted to make it perfectly clear that her breaking up with you had nothing to do with your age, but, rather, your compatibility.
You see, it's not your fault that you don't like the same food, music or movies And she didn't bring this up, did she?
- No.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- She doesn't want to see me again?
- I know.
I feel so terrible.
Listen, Dad, I know exactly how you're feeling right now.
But, believe me, the pain will pass.
It may take some time.
This is great.
Or not.
Wait till I tell Sherry.
- Sherry?
- Wow.
This stuff works pretty good.
We got any pretzels?
Dad?
Just who is Sherry?
She's this great lady I met down at McGinty's.
You know, I've been trying for weeks to get up the nerve to end it with Maureen.
Good Lord.
I've been worried all afternoon about Maureen breaking your heart, and all along, you've been two-timing Maureen.
Oh.
Well, hi, Maureen.
Come in.
- Did you forget something?
- Yes, I did.
Oh, don't mind me.
I was just going out.
To the powder room.
Bye-bye.
There's something that I've been meaning to say to you, and I keep putting it off.
And that's not fair to you.
What is it?
I don't think it's working out.
You don't?
Wow.
I didn't see that coming.
Marty, it's not the age difference.
It's just All we ever talk about is the police force, - and I enjoy that, but I just think - No, Maureen.
Now, come on.
You don't need to explain.
You know, I guess I always knew that I could never hold on to a prize like you forever.
But at least I did it for a while.
So are?
Are you okay?
I will be.
It just takes a little time, you know, but You take care of yourself.
Yeah, you too.
Okay.
- You old fraud.
- What?
You made her believe that she'd broken your heart.
Well, of course I did.
When a woman breaks up with you, you have to act sad.
It's only polite.
Polite?
My God, Dad, guilt is a very destructive emotion.
Spare me the lvy League bull.
There ain't a dame alive who wouldn't rather break a guy's heart than think she hadn't even made a dent in it.
I may not have been to Harvard, but I have been to the college of love.
Apparently on a Spillane Fellowship.
-  Hello, Dr Crane.
-  Hey, Daphne.
-  Hello, Niles.
-  Where's the birthday boy?
He's getting all dolled up for his lady friend.
You should see how excited he is.
Not half as excited as he's going to be when he sees these new videos.
Twelve cassettes of the history of World War II.
For those who thought the original was fun but too short.
This year I thought, "What the hell, give him something he wants instead of what I think he needs".
- Very commendable sentiment.
- What did you get him?
An Armani tux.
Well, my banquet's coming up.
-  Hey, Niles.
-  Hey, Dad.
- Don't you look dapper?
- Well, thanks.
Yeah, I heard the door.
I thought maybe it was Sherry.
I thought we were joining her and your chums at the restaurant.
Yeah, I changed my mind.
You know, I just thought that I'm just so anxious for you to meet her.
I know you're gonna love her.
No.
Forget I said that.
I mean, you will, but I just don't wanna jinx it.
There it is.
Frasier, answer the door, would you, please?
No, wait, I'll get it.
Happy birthday.
Come on in and meet the family.
Hi.
Sherry Dempsey.
Now, Marty didn't tell me the two of you were so handsome.
Hello.
Daphne Moon.
Oh, the physical therapist.
- Right.
- Don't worry about me, honey.
I'm not the jealous type.
Anybody that keeps my Marty limber is aces in my book.
- Hey, sit down, Sherry.
Come on.
- Okay.
You know, Fras, Sherry's a big fan of your show.
Oh, yes, a big fan.
Well, as a matter of fact, when my friend Donna's marriage was on the rocks, you were the one that she called for advice.
Really?
And did my advice prove helpful?
That's not important.
- You cared.
That's what matters.
- Can we offer you a drink?
Well, actually, since it's a special occasion, I brought some bubbly.
- Let's crack it open.
- Well.
Yes, why not?
Oh, look, Frasier, Cold Duck.
- You ever had it?
- Just once.
- I'll do the honours.
- Thank you.
Oh, I love this apartment.
- Wow, that's some view you've got.
-  Thank you.
Which room's mine?
Gotcha.
She's always doing stuff like that.
Oh, I love making people laugh.
To me, humour is like medicine.
Guess we're in the placebo group.
So, um Dad tells me that you, you two kids met at McGinty's.
That's right.
I tend bar there.
Saw your dad there one night looking kind of lonesome, - and I said to myself - Bottoms up.
Well, something like that.
- Here we go.
- Thank you.
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
- Through the lips and over the gums Look out taste buds, here it comes.
I never heard that version.
- Mmm.
-  Ooh.
Mmm.
Ooh.
Lovely.
Woo!
Oh!
I'd better be careful.
Two glasses of that, I'd be dancing on the table.
Yeah, you know, Sherry used to be on stage.
On Broadway?
Las Vegas.
Ever been there?
Just once.
What a town, huh?
Great food, terrific theatre.
Just too darn easy to get married.
- You're separated, right?
- Yes.
I've been there.
- Listen, you want my advice?
- Well Don't mope.
Get right back in the saddle.
My mama always used to say to me, "Honey, the only way to get over someone is to get under someone".
- It's cute, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Well, Mama had lots of sayings like that.
I didn't know Mae West had children.
Well, hey, we'd better be going.
So if you want to freshen up or anything, you'd better do it now.
- It's down there.
- I'll show you the way.
I know what you're doing here.
You just want the reviews.
Talk me up.
No, that's not it at all.
You think you're so smart.
Well, what do you think?
- Wow.
- Niles?
Oh, I'll see that "wow" and raise you a "zowie".
I'm so glad you like her.
Now, you really do, right?
Yes, Dad.
- Absolutely.
- That's great.
Great.
We're gonna have to spend more time here.
You know, she's got that fourth-floor walk-up, and it's murder on my hip.
Not that I wouldn't climb the Space Needle to hear her play that banjo of hers.
Clam up, boys, she's back.
You know, I keep meaning to ask what's that lovely perfume you're wearing?
Yes, I've been wondering that myself.
It's called Milady's Boudoir.
You wouldn't believe what a bargain it is.
For a hundred bucks, I could buy enough to drown myself in.
- I've got 60.
- Yeah.
Again, I'm sorry for not making it over for dinner last night, - but I had this tickle in my throat.
- Spare me your lame excuses.
We both know why you weren't there.
How was Sherry?
Colourful as ever.
Last night she treated us to selections from her unpublished volume of limericks for lovers.
The last several about a well-travelled man fortuitously named Horatio.
- Oh, dear God.
Don't turn around.
- Who is it?
It's Dad, and he's brought Sophie Tucker.
Oh, no.
- But this is our place.
- Don't look.
Hi.
How are you doing?
- Look who's here.
- Hi, boys!
Oh, wow, what a cute place this is.
I walk by here all the time and never stopped in.
Yeah, well, the boys love it here.
We should start coming here.
Make room at that table.
We'll be right back.
We're gonna get a cuppa.
Quick, Niles, pull up the ladder.
- She found our clubhouse.
- Oh.
This can not go on.
You're right.
Dad has to be politely told that even though he may enjoy her company, he has no right to What's a polite word for "inflict"?
I don't know, but I'm sure you'll find one.
Me?
You mean I have to do this alone?
I thought the two of us would sit down and talk to him No, no, no, no.
I'm afraid you're the one who's going to be making that little speech.
Niles, both of us have a problem Ah, ah, ah, ah.
She's not invading my apartment.
I can afford to be patient.
You are a little weasel, aren't you?
A little weasel whose daddy loves him.
Niles, before I forget.
About your banquet?
Are we talking fancy-schmancy?
That's not exactly the way it was worded on the invitation, but yes.
- Why?
- Well, Daphne's got a cold, so Sherry's gonna use her ticket.
What fun.
That's coming up soon, isn't it?
Maybe you should start working on that little speech.
Ooh.
So fancy dress, huh?
Good.
I have got a backless leopard-skin number that is gonna knock your eyes out.
Gotcha.
Ow!
I'm sorry.
I'm smushing you.
No, that's all right.
We were just leaving.
- Ah, you gotta go?
- Yes.
Well, now, Niles, don't worry about your banquet.
I'll wear a nice dress and put on my best dancing shoes.
Well, there won't be dancing.
You just leave that to Sherry.
Well, your little banquet should prove quite amusing.
I hope Dr Gottfreund doesn't aggravate his hernia when he goes underneath the limbo pole.
I have to talk to Dad.
I can't let her ruin the most important evening of my life.
What do I say to him?
Frasier, you've gotta help me.
Well, prepared though you were to abandon me, and let me handle all the dirty work alone, I will swallow my resentment, confront him with you tonight, and take my share of the heat.
Thank you.
Gotcha.
So, Niles, what are you in the mood for?
Normandy or the Battle of the Bulge?
Whatever.
What?
You've been fidgeting around all night.
Something on your mind?
Uh, yes, actually.
- It's about my awards banquet.
- Yeah?
Uh.
Dad, this is very difficult to say.
Uh I would really rather you didn't wear those pants.
Well, I'm not.
I'm wearing that Avanti tux you gave me.
What's your problem?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I guess l I don't know, I'm just nervous about tomorrow night.
God knows why.
- Evening, Dad.
- Evening.
Something wrong?
You know, that brother of yours can be downright insulting.
He's so afraid someone's gonna embarrass him at his fancy dinner.
Um, you know, Niles, uh, told me about what he was going to say to you tonight and, um, well, I must say in his defence that it is an important evening for him and, well, let's face it, Sherry can be a bit much.
- She can, huh?
- Well I mean, I don't mean it as a criticism, mind you.
Some people like that.
Well, now that Niles has broached the subject, I must say that I too, find Sherry a bit brassy and flamboyant He didn't say a word to you, did he?
I don't believe this.
You got a problem with Sherry?
That delightful woman?
Oh, knock it off.
I see you're still waiting on that spine donor.
Look, Dad, there is no reason to belabour this point No, no.
You got something to say, let's hear it.
You don't like her?
Please understand, Dad, as happy as we are that you've found someone - But you don't like her.
We're not saying that.
She, She's just not the sort of person that we would normally choose to spend time with.
In other words, you don't like her.
Come on, we're all grown-ups here.
Tell me the truth.
All right, Dad, we don't like her.
Fine.
If that's the way you feel about it, don't worry.
I won't bring her back here anymore.
I guess it's too much to expect my own family to make a person I care about feel welcome.
Wait a minute!
When did you ever make any of the women we were involved with feel welcome?
Ooh, Frasier, you're right.
He almost got away with that.
When did Lilith ever step foot in your house that you didn't make her feel as wanted as a fungus?
Not to mention my Maris.
What, you're comparing a warm lady like Sherry to Frosty the Snow Wife?
There!
That, that, that is exactly what I'm talking about.
Oh, you know, why don't we just face facts?
I mean, since when has any one of us ever, from Sherry, to Lilith, to Maris, to Diane, has ever been able to pick one woman the other two could stand?
I picked your mother.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I've been hogging the floor.
Um Ah, forget it.
You're right.
Why should I expect you to make the effort when I'm no better?
Hell, you probably got it from me.
You sure didn't get it from your mother, because she was great that way.
Anytime she ever met anybody, she would always find something to like about them.
One of the things I loved her for.
That's one of the things I love Sherry for.
She's a lot like your mother that way.
She'll always find something.
Even with you two.
Well, I suppose we could all afford to be a bit more open-minded when it comes to each other's mates.
Well, at the very least, if we can't say anything nice, we shouldn't say anything at all.
We'll be having some quiet Thanksgivings, but fine with me.
- Hi, Sherry.
- Hi.
- Don't you look nice?
Come on in.
- Well, thank you, Frasier.
Oh, Marty, I brought you one more little gift.
- Another one?
- Well, I wanted to give it to you on your birthday, but it took a while to find the right size.
Really?
I'm usually a pretty easy fit.
- Who said it's for you to wear?
- Oh-ho!
I like it already.
Oh, I should stop.
- I'm embarrassing your boys.
- No, you're not.
Is she?
No.
- Party on.
- All right.
Well, I think we should go and unwrap this.
Oh, Dad, Lilith mentioned that she was gonna be joining Frederick on his next visit.
You don't mind if she stays here, do you?
Oh, Lilith?
No.
Great.
I love Lilith.
That's terrific.
No, she's welcome here anytime.
Honey, you're hurting my hand.
Oh, listen, I should mention, I'm kind of a sleepwalker.
So if you get up in the night, and find me in here naked, just give me a good hard shake.
I'll come to in a jiff.
Ha!
Ha-ha!
Got me.
Good one.
That was great.
- You really got them good.
- I know.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I'm glad you came back with us.
I hope you had a good time.
Well, I can't tell you how much fun this has been.
Listen, now that you know the way, don't be a stranger, okay?
Good night.
Who the hell was that?
- He's not from the station?
- I never saw him before.
He was table-hopping like crazy during the awards.
That's because he was our waiter.
Well, that's the last time I say, "Everybody back to my place".
Oh, who cares about that guy?
This is a great night.
For you, maybe.
The rest of us lost.
Hey, it's not important whether you win or lose.
It's an honour just being nomi  I couldn't get through that crap on stage.
I can't get through it now.
- Do you mind if I use your phone?
No, not at all.
Who are you calling?
It's midnight.
I promised my grandmother I'd leave her a message telling her how we did.
Hey, Gammy, it's Roz.
Guess what?
I won again.
We're all here celebrating.
Yay.
Listen, I gotta go.
It's getting crazy here, but I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
You lied to Gammy?
Well, she's old, and it makes her happy.
She smiled for a week when I won the Miss Seattle pageant.
You know, Roz raises a very interesting philosophical question.
Here we go.
Buckle up.
Is it always morally wrong to lie?
Now, we are taught that it is.
But are there certain occasions where a lie would be acceptable?
Yeah, like the lies you tell a chick in bed.
"You're the best I've ever been with".
"Your thighs don't look that fat".
"Don't worry, I've had a vasectomy".
Hey, screw you guys!
I'm an artist.
We live by different rules.
An argument can certainly be made that a lie is good when it spares someone unnecessary pain.
I'm reminded of Maris' brief flirtation with active wear when I assured her, "You look fine, darling, spandex is supposed to blouse".
You know, Lilith actually told me the other day that Frederick has taken to lying.
Yes, he told all of his friends that Lilith is an alien.
It seems as good an explanation as any.
Yes, he also told them that she wears her hair in a bun to hide the third eye in the back of her head.
- How did Lilith find out?
Well, apparently, she was driving him and two of his friends over to a Junior Mensa meeting.
She looked in the rear-view mirror and saw that they were making faces at the other cars.
So never have the words "I can see you" caused so much screaming and wetting of pants.
I did my share of fibbing too.
I once told my school chums I was born with a tiny embryonic twin attached to my hip.
Of course, they were horrified, and it didn't help my social life at all.
Oh, but for a while there it was nice having a sister.
Oh, remember in prep school when we were so desperate to avoid the President's Physical Fitness Test That we lit a match underneath the fire alarm, - and all the sprinklers went off.
- And we blamed that delinquent kid, - John Rajeski.
- Yes.
- You did what?
- What's wrong?
You two swore up and down to me that you never set off that alarm.
Well, of course, we weren't gonna tell you.
For heaven's sake, Dad, you can't be mad.
We were kids.
You know, the headmaster said it was you two.
I went there and raised hell with him.
I said, "My kids don't lie".
Because of you, that Rajeski kid got expelled.
Expelled?
Jeez, if we'd known that was gonna happen, - we would've told the truth.
- Not me.
He was a brute and a meanie.
You're right.
He used to make the most merciless fun of me because I always wore my gym shorts in the shower.
He used to call me shorts-in-the-shower boy.
Well, you don't have to be witty to be cruel.
I don't give a damn what that kid did.
Getting him expelled was worse.
I'm going to bed.
Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
Good night, Dad.
Well, I guess that brings an end to our little debate.
Apparently, there are no good lies.
Hey, hey, it's getting kind of heavy in here.
We gotta liven this place up, huh?
Hey, I know.
Party games, huh?
All right, doc, I'm gonna need a blindfold, some whipped cream and a glass coffee table.
What?
Nobody here went to camp?
- Forget it.
- Hold on.
These guys are no fun.
You know what?
I know a great after-hours place where we can go get a few drinks.
Now you're talking.
Hey, if things go well, I know an after-after-hours place.
- I got the keys.
- You get the elevator, I'll get my coat.
You're on.
No good lies, my ass.
Good morning, Frasier.
- Oh, good morning, Niles.
Oh, dear God, it's finally happened.
This is the thanks I get for introducing you to my personal shopper.
I gave Rinaldo instructions to write down every article of clothing I've purchased so we could avoid this sort of calamity.
I didn't use Rinaldo.
This suit just caught my eye while I was shopping for shoes.
Oh!
Well, why didn't you also take - my strong chin and swimmer's build?
Oh, please.
- Obviously, we have to sit apart today.
- Oh, sit down!
There's something I need to talk to you about.
Most people aren't as attuned to these things as you and I are.
I'm sure they won't even notice.
Here, double espresso.
I took a chance and brought you the same thing.
Well, anyway, after our conversation last night, I couldn't stop thinking about our getting John Rajeski expelled.
- I didn't sleep a wink.
- You can't be serious.
You mean, it didn't bother you?
Where is your conscience?
Perhaps it fell into the quad along with my hall monitor beret when John hung me from the flagpole.
He was going to be expelled sooner or later.
You cannot guilt me into feeling bad.
Yes, well, no one hated him more than I did, but I still think we owe him an apology.
- May I borrow your phone, Niles?
- Certainly.
There you are.
You're not going to call him.
- I am.
- Are you insane?
Hello, a number for a John Rajeski, please.
Niles, my conscience won't rest until the two of us have said we're sorry.
Oh, yes, connect me, please.
Leave me out of this.
I'm not sorry.
But don't tell him that.
And if he asks, I'm living in Italy.
No, no, France.
No, Italy.
Yes, hello.
Is John Rajeski there, please?
It's an old friend of his.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
Niles, it's worse than we thought.
He's in prison.
Well, who's wearing shorts in the shower now?
Yes, well, joke all you like.
I still can't help thinking this is all our fault.
- How?
- Well, he was always on the cusp.
Maybe he couldn't get in another prep school.
Maybe he had to go to public.
Fell in with the wrong crowd, couldn't hold down a job, he turned to a life of crime.
Frasier, sometimes bad things happen to bad people.
We did not set him on the path to prison.
Until I'm sure, my conscience will not rest.
I have got to speak with him.
May I have the check?
You're not going down to the jail.
Yes, I am.
I invite you to join me.
Oh, yes, that's a good idea, Frasier.
The Crane boys going to a prison in matching outfits.
- Frasier Crane?
- John.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, fine.
And you?
Eh.
- What brings you down here?
- Well, I don't know if you get the alumni magazine, but - No.
- I became a psychiatrist, and I'm currently conducting a study on men behind bars and how they got there.
That's an awfully nasty bruise on your knuckles.
Oh, this Caught some guy using my comb.
I really hate it when people touch my stuff.
Oh, yes, I remember my brother Niles once sat in your chair in the cafeteria.
As I recall, you put him on a tray and ran him through the dishwasher.
Yeah, class clown, that was me.
Yeah, how is Niles anyway?
He's He's abroad now.
Really?
- Whoa, that must have hurt.
- No, no, I mean Well, yes, I suppose it did.
Anyway, it would be an enormous help in my study if you could perhaps pinpoint the moment or event in your life that led you to here.
Oh, that's easy.
I'm doing time for passing a bad check.
Yeah, you see, I wanted to get my wife something nice.
Been going through a rough time recently.
I was scared she was gonna leave me.
That was quick and painless.
We identified the point where you fell off the beam.
Actually, though, I was already on probation.
I did some time about ten years back for driving a car that didn't belong to me.
And that was your first infraction.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, then, case closed, mystery solved.
Young man yields to the lure of a bright and shiny car.
- Is there anything more tragic?
- I did have a juvenile record.
Apparently, there is.
Got thrown out of high school for fighting.
You did say high school, not prep school?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This was way after you knew me.
I went bad then.
Always getting into fights.
Of course, I wouldn't have been there in the first place if I hadn't got thrown out of that good school you and me were in.
That had a big effect on me, you know?
Yes, well, perhaps we could continue our backward journey No, no, no, that was a bum rap.
Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
They blamed me for it.
They said I did it.
I didn't do it.
- Let's discuss your early childhood.
- You know, the more I think about it, this all started the day I got thrown out of prep school.
Ever since then, my life's been crap.
Crap!
You know, I think I have all the information I need now.
Sorry, I didn't mean to blow like that.
Well, that's all right, John.
Thank you for your time.
Got plenty of it, huh?
- See you.
- Yeah.
No, no, John, there's just one more thing.
One second, please.
There's something I need to tell you about.
Something I did in school I'm not very proud of.
Yo, John.
Sorry I touched your comb, man.
Beat it.
So, what'd you do?
Well, I peeked over your shoulder once during an algebra quiz.
And I'm the one who gets expelled.
Evening, Dr Crane.
Hello, Daphne, Dad.
Hi.
Is something wrong with your back?
I injured it this morning playing squash.
I had to make a dive to save match point.
Well, I've got just the thing to take care of that.
Take off your jacket.
I'll be right back.
You're too kind.
I should never have even attempted a move like that.
It was sort of a cross between a pirouette and a flying-scissor kick.
You hurt yourself adjusting the seat in your Mercedes again?
Quiet.
All right, pull out your shirttails and lay face down on the sofa.
I can guarantee you within a minute you'll be feeling much better.
I haven't even touched you yet.
I started without you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not gonna use that stuff on him, are you?
She used it on me one time, and it burned like hell.
Oh, hush up, old man.
It helped you, didn't it?
It nearly killed me.
Oh, listen to the big, tough policeman.
You don't hear your son complaining, do we, Dr Crane?
Not a bit.
Frost me like a cake.
Well, just wait a minute.
It goes on cool, but then it turns into a blowtorch.
Well, I guess now we know who the real man in the family is, don't we?
I should say we do.
- Is it starting to warm up?
- Yeah.
But it's It's a refreshing heat, like those towels they give you on the airplane.
Whoo.
I'm not hurting you, am I?
No, no, I'm just a little ticklish back there.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Well, I guess you are the tough one.
There you go.
- Wait a minute.
You missed a spot.
No, that's okay, because it's all done now.
And thank you, Daphne.
A few minutes ago, I was bent over in pain, but now look at me.
I'm running!
- How is that hip of yours, anyway?
- Back off, witch woman.
Evening, Dr Crane.
- Good evening, Daphne.
- How'd it go at the jail?
- Horribly.
The man is convinced that getting thrown out of prep school was the beginning of his life of crime.
He's been thinking that all these years?
No.
I sort of connected the dots for him.
- Did you tell him it was you?
- No, I intended to, but I became convinced the man would be willing to perform unspeakable atrocities on the responsible party or parties.
Well, you probably made the right call.
Knowing you, you'd beat yourself up worse than he would anyway.
I hope you remembered to tell him I was an expatriate.
I told him you were an ex-something.
You know, I just feel so guilty.
Jeez, I've done this man a terrible injustice.
You know, Dr Crane, I've always believed life has a way of balancing itself out.
Well, yes, you may have treated this man unfairly, but think of all the people you've helped on your show.
Well, just yesterday you reconciled that couple on the brink of divorce.
Today you helped Molly from Tacoma overcome her addiction to Swedes.
That was "sweets," not Swedes.
I thought it was strange when you told her to limit herself to one or two after meals.
Perhaps I just have an overactive conscience.
It's not enough that I've helped other people, I want to help this man.
I hope you do, because then you'll stop torturing the rest of us with all your - Oh, pain's back.
- Don't worry, she's got more liniment.
Oh, pain's gone.
Oh, come on now.
Don't be brave.
Let's go into the loo, and I'll give you a second coat.
You know, Dad, Daphne gives me a thought.
I'm a skilled couple's therapist.
And John did mention that he was having marital problems.
Oh, jeez.
- No, Dad, this is perfect.
It's perfect.
I may have ruined the last 25 years of this man's life, but with my gift, I could save the next 25.
- A listing for John Rajeski.
Residence.
- I'm telling you, Frasier, don't get mixed up with this guy.
He's a felon.
Connect me, please.
Dad, just relax, I know what I'm doing.
Mrs Rajeski.
Hello.
You don't know me, but I'm  My.
Well, that's remarkable.
Yes, I am a friend of your husband's.
Mrs Rajeski.
Wow, it's really you, - Frasier Crane.
- Yes.
May I?
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Please, please, come in.
You know, you're kind of like a god down at work.
- Please, please sit down.
- Thank you, thank you.
Well, let me cut right to the chase.
John told me that you two were going through a bit of a A rough patch, and I was wondering if there's anything I can do to help.
Well, I love John.
I really do.
But there is a problem.
It's just a little difficult talking about it, you know.
I mean, it's a little embarrassing, especially face to face.
Well, then, I'll tell you what.
Just pretend I'm on my radio show.
There.
There now, you're just another caller.
Okay.
Well, Dr Crane, it's a sexual problem.
You see, I can only get really turned on when there's something that makes the whole situation sort of dangerous.
- Dangerous?
- You're looking at me.
- Sorry.
Like doing it in a car.
Well, that's not so dangerous.
You must be some driver.
Oh.
And you've never had an accident?
No, I'm on the pill.
So Well, how long have you had this particular kink?
Well, I don't know really.
It It kind of started around the time that I first met John.
I was working in a convenience store.
I caught him shoplifting.
Next thing I knew, we were rolling around on the Slurpee machine.
I'd already pressed the silent alarm, so I knew that the cops were on their way.
That's when I realized what really turns me on.
Knowing I could get caught at any moment.
Oh, dear God!
He's out of jail, isn't he?
- He could walk in at any time.
- Come on, he'll kill us.
Touch me here and say that.
Are you crazy?
He doesn't even let people touch his comb!
I know.
What's that all about?
Put your dress back on.
Straighten up before he gets home.
Hey, Suse, come on, open up.
Look, if you've only got time for one, I suggest the dress.
- Where's the bedroom?
- You're in it.
Get him out of here.
Pass up a chance to have sex with him knowing he could find you here at any minute?
Oh, God!
Welcome home, baby!
It's great to be back!
What are you doing?
Well, I'm just getting ready for you.
Oh, I missed you.
So do you want to?
Sure, I do, but You mean, normally?
The super's not gonna barge in?
You didn't dial 911 or anything like that?
I've got everything I need right here in this room.
All right!
- I'm just gonna pull down the shades.
Wait, wait!
What the hell is this?
How much did you spend on these?
Oh, Johnny, can't we talk about that later?
Hey, why don't you turn off the light.
It's too dark.
I wanna see you.
Whatever you want, baby.
Oh, this is gonna be great.
I am gonna make love to you all night.
Oh, but first, I have a surprise for you.
I wrote a poem for you while I was in prison.
I am a garden, dry and brown You are the rain that tumbles down Susan I am a beggar who needs to eat You are a sandwich thick with meat, Susan  Oh, my God!
I knew you had something planned.
You set the building on fire!
No, I didn't.
I swear!
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- But the firemen, they're on their way!
Come on!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Well, I'm off to get our lunch.
Any special requests?
- No, anything you pick up will be fine.
- Okay, then.
Back in a bit.
She is such a doll.
You are such a doll.
- I thought she'd never leave.
- I know.
- It's nice to have time alone finally.
- Come here, you.
Hey, you, get your own!
No, go on.
Now, get away.
Come on.
- Hey, come with me.
Come on, Eddie.
- Go on.
Go on.
There you go.
Seat's already up for you.
It's happy hour.
Bye.
- Now, where were we?
- Oh, come here, you little devil, you.
Look who was just coming home with take-out from the gourmet shop.
- Oh, isn't that lucky?
Hey, boys.
My, don't you look handsome in your best bib and tucker.
Come on and give Aunt Sherry a great big kiss.
Or perhaps just a friendly wave from across the room.
Niles, you are so shy.
Thank God your big brother isn't.
Come on, Fras, plant one on me.
There you are.
Has Eddie been licking you?
- Yes.
- Yes, I thought your perfume had a hint of Snausage in it.
So you two have been shopping.
Well, "antique-ing" actually.
I just found the most exquisite Japanese doorknocker.
It's said to bring peace and tranquillity to any home it adorns.
I haven't seen any decent Oriental knockers since Empress Chow's Shanghai Revue.
Isn't she great?
She's as funny as she is classy.
No argument there.
Oh, by the way, if you want someone to install that for you, I can put you in touch with my ex-houseman, Ghi.
- Ghi?
- No, Ghi.
- Ghi?
- No, no.
Back of the throat.
Ghi.
Oh, what's the difference?
I'm not so helpless that I cannot install a simple doorknocker on my own.
You might want to use the screwdriver.
That's exactly what I was about to get.
It's in the tool drawer.
The drawer under that big tea server thing.
Dad, that is a Byelorussian samovar.
By God, how long have you lived here?
Here we are.
Lunch is ready.
Actually, I just remembered, I've got an errand I gotta run before I get to work.
Goodbye, Niles.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kiss you.
I know it embarrasses you.
Wait, come here.
You got some schmutz on your cheek.
My mistake, it's a mole.
You might wanna have that checked.
Oh, I think now I'll just play it safe and have it removed.
Oh, Daphne, apparently this morning when you were dusting, you forgot This objet does not face front, but rather, askew.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dr Crane.
I should never have tried to do it without that diagram you drew me.
Frasier, now that I know you like antiques, I've got a little present at home for you.
It's a lamp shaped like two frogs kissing.
And when you turn it on, their hearts glow.
When would you like me to bring it by?
Preferably when I'm here.
I'll bring it with me tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
Daphne, would you bring me that hammer?
I thought you just needed a screwdriver.
Well, I do.
I just wanna be prepared when that froggy lamp gets here.
- See you later, honey.
I'll call you.
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, hi there, Mrs Langer.
- Ms. Oh, right, Mis erable old cow.
- Tonight's your opera night, isn't it?
- Yes.
Why?
Well, I was wondering.
I'd love to cook a nice romantic dinner for Sherry, but I can't do it at her place because I'm allergic to her cats, and there's just no privacy around here.
Say no more, Dad.
My bachelor pad is the perfect place to entertain a young lady.
Just remember: Always use coasters, no snacking in the carpeted areas, and close the art books after viewing so you don't crease the spine.
I believe they have the same rules at the Playboy Mansion.
Well, there we are.
That's that, huh?
That's not so hard.
Tomorrow, I may just have to tackle that leaky sink in the powder room.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a joke.
The inaugural knock.
Oh, what's this?
"Your unauthorized doorknocker violates the condo by-laws regarding hallway decoration.
Remove it immediately".
That's one of Mrs Langer's "no-no" slips.
I can't stand that woman.
Just because she's president of the condo board, she acts like this building's her kingdom.
Everything has to be done exactly the way she likes it.
Yes, well, Daphne, no one hates a bossy fuss-budget more than I do, but, Daphne Askew, askew!
Don't you see?
But rules are there for a reason.
I was obviously at fault for not getting approval before I hung it up there.
I did notice a sign in the lobby about some condo board meeting tonight if you want to present your case.
Perfect.
We live in a democratic system, and I will work within it.
I'm sure I can persuade them with my charm and eloquence.
I don't know.
Those people can be very difficult.
Pish-tosh.
It's not as though I'll be addressing the Supreme Court.
I'll simply be talking to the board.
Well, they will be by the time he gets through.
After careful consideration of the bids from a number of gardeners, we have decided to go with Jordan Landscaping.
Excuse me.
I'm not too late, am I?
I was hoping to make a statement.
Me too.
No, they'll be getting to new business shortly.
Good, good.
I have a matter of some import to discuss.
Well, then you should go before me.
Oh, thank you.
Why are you here?
To ask them to make the ramp out front less steep so I don't keep rolling into traffic.
How about you?
Oh, well Perhaps you should go first.
Is that Frasier Crane talking while I'm talking?
Well, yes.
I'm sorry, Ms Langer.
I was just inquiring as to whether I was too late to raise some new business.
Well, we were just about to get to that.
Why don't you go ahead?
I'll be quick.
Earlier today, I installed a doorknocker without your permission.
Now, I'd like to say in my defence that my overeagerness was not out of disrespect but enthusiasm for an object which, I'm sure you will agree, is really quite beautiful.
I understand the rule exists to prohibit people from putting eyesores in public places, but I ask you, should it apply to something as beautiful as this?
Here, if you will.
Please.
Something, which serves only to elevate our spirits.
Let's just say that someone passes by my door, sees the knocker, and suddenly feels just a little bit better, without even knowing why.
That same person passes a perfect stranger and smiles, who in turn reaches down, picks up, perhaps, a piece of trash, plants a garden, volunteers at a soup kitchen.
Like little ripples on a still pond, the happiness spreads.
So, what I'm asking you to do is think of this not simply as an ornament, but rather an opportunity.
Dare I say it, knocking on a door of a new, more civilized world.
Thank you.
- Allow us just a moment.
Of course.
Request denied.
You must remove the knocker within 24 hours, despite the consequences to world peace.
Yes, well, I appreciate your Are you still talking?
- Your request is denied!
Sit down!
- But there's been no discussion.
It hasn't even been opened up to the floor.
I will entertain suggestions from the floor if anyone has any idea how to shut this man up!
I came down here expecting a fair hearing in the democratic tradition.
But I see now that you are a tyrant, concerned more with the exercise of power than with justice.
Well, fine, I will leave now, taking solace in the certain knowledge that, in time, you, Ms Langer, will join all tyrants on the ash heap of history!
I'm not here.
Pardon me.
Oh, dear.
I'll just get those later.
Dr Crane.
- Yes.
Who's there?
- A friend.
Keep your distance.
- Well, why can't I see you?
- That's not important right now.
What's important is that you were not afraid to go up against Ms Langer last night.
- Without much success.
- More than you know.
Most people in the building are afraid of her.
There is a group of us who fight her, though, a small, but determined band of resisters.
You know the new doormat by the service elevator?
We did that.
It's very nice.
We would like you to be our candidate and go up against her in the upcoming elections.
I'm flattered, but I have a great many demands You are our only chance, Dr Crane.
And she must be defeated.
She is evil.
Nichols, in 1704, was two days late with his condo fee, and she lowered the water pressure in his shower.
Eventually, he died.
From bad water pressure?
No, I think it was a hunting accident.
But he spent his last months on this earth unable to get all the conditioner out of his hair.
Only you possess the charisma and courage to defeat her.
Well, that may be, but I am not asking you to decide right now.
I just want you to say you'll think about it.
All right.
But why can't I see who you are?
Because I'm remodelling my bathroom.
If she found out I was talking to you, she would never approve my bidet.
Just think of me as "Mr X." That would work better without the vanity plates, Dr Dorfman.
Frasier, wait.
- Oh, hello, Niles.
The most extraordinary thing happened to me in the garage.
- Excuse me.
Is Dad home now?
- Yes, as far as I know.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.
- Why?
Is something wrong?
Well, last night I invited Dad to use my apartment for a quiet, romantic dinner with Sherry while I attended La Traviata.
Well, the production was just dreadful.
In "Ah, fors'e lui" the soprano couldn't hit the E flat above high C. So I got so fed up, I stormed out, drove home, entered my apartment, and when I saw what Dad and Sherry were doing there, I hit the note myself.
- You mean they were?
- They were.
What did you do?
Pulled up a chaise longue and took out my opera glasses.
What do you think I did?
I slammed the door and ran away.
I've never been so embarrassed.
I don't think I can face him now.
You simply have to diffuse the entire subject with a simple adult conversation.
I don't wanna recreate what happened to Maris and me after the cabin incident, when I walked in on her taking a shower.
Oh, God.
Months of avoidance and awkwardness.
Excuse me.
You saw my Maris completely naked?
Don't fret.
It was nothing more than a fleeting glance in a very steamy bathroom.
More like glimpsing a bird sapling through a thick fog.
Life is so unfair.
You get a vision of my Maris, I get a big eyeful of Dad.
Well, I'd say we hit about the same level on the "yikes" meter.
Oh, Roz, you're here.
Is that your apology for making me work on Saturday - and then getting here late?
- I was detained.
Roz, the most extraordinary thing happened.
I was in the parking garage.
Suddenly, I was blinded by a set of headlights.
A mysterious man crept from the shadows and told me that I should run for condo board president.
You've been at your wine club, haven't you?
No.
This really happened.
Surely, you're not actually thinking of running.
You've never held an elected office in your life.
You're forgetting?
I served two terms back in high school as Grand Panjandrum of the Vocabulary Club.
Listen, Frasier, this job is a nightmare.
Trust me, I know.
Like, if somebody wants a garbage disposal, they'll bug you day and night.
They'll leave kitchen scraps in your mailbox until they get what they want.
You've served on a condo board?
No, but I have a brand-new garbage disposal.
- Hello, all.
Daphne.
- Let me help you with those.
Oh, thanks.
I've had to lug these things five blocks.
This morning, Mrs Langer gave me one of those "no-no" slips for parking in the same vacant space I've been using for years.
Oh, I'm sorry, Daphne.
I'm afraid this is my fault.
Ms Langer is simply retaliating against me.
You see, last night, I rather humiliated her in a dazzling display of rhetoric.
I heard you spilled your briefcase all over the floor.
This building has a grapevine Ernest and Julio Gallo would envy!
Well, you know, perhaps I should run against Ms Langer.
God knows she's ripe for a good comeuppance.
I know exactly what you mean, Dr Crane.
I was standing behind her in the elevator the other day, looking at the back of her head, and I thought: "You know, several stout whacks with a tire iron and this building will be a much happier place".
I'll just get these bags off to the kitchen.
Frasier, this Langer woman sounds if she wields considerable power.
What if you run against her and lose?
I'm with Niles.
Let somebody else do it.
What an appalling expression of apathy!
What kind of a world would this be if everyone thought that way?
Everyone does think that way.
And look at the kind of world it is!
Corruption in high places.
An electorate unconcerned with real issues because they're too consumed with their own pleasures.
- Is this eclair spoken for?
- It's mine.
Put it back!
Roz, don't you see?
For it is if you're not willing to get involved, then you have no right to grumble when things don't go your way.
Look at this.
I got two slips for not taking Eddie on the freight elevator.
It's ridiculous.
Everybody uses the main elevator.
Mrs Tornquist has her dog, Fluffy, in there all the time.
Well, that's it.
I am running for condo board president.
A time comes in every man's life when he must meet face to face a challenge, rather than skitter away like a coward.
Well, I'm proud of you, son.
That's the way a Crane talks.
Oh, Dad, nice seeing you.
I mean, not  Okay, Eddie.
Now.
Good boy, Eddie.
Now, go make dinner.
It's just a little joke Eddie and I have been working on.
It's too bad.
It explained so much.
- What is this, another one?
- Oh, yes.
Seems your father got it last night.
I guess he's just refusing to take Eddie in the freight elevator.
Of course, all that'll be different once you're elected.
We don't wanna jinx it.
But I must say, I think my chances are good after this missive I found this morning on my windshield.
It's from the resistance.
"Dear Dr Crane.
We have polled the building, the election is yours.
Good work".
Signed, "Anonymous".
Wouldn't this be more anonymous if it didn't say: "From the desk of Dr William M. Dorfman"?
Yes.
Well, now you see why they need me.
My comfortable lead aside, I still wish I had a punchier opening for the speech I wrote.
Well, I'm running out of time.
Unless Yes.
I think Ms Langer may have given me the very ammunition I need for my opening salvo.
We'll just see how the voters feel about a woman who tries to persecute a disabled ex-policeman and his loyal little dog.
It'll be nice to live where people can hang whatever they damn well please on their door.
Of course.
Well, pending my approval.
- Is he gone?
Yes.
- You're not avoiding him, are you?
- Well, yeah, kind of.
I mean, it's pretty embarrassing about getting caught last night in that hot tub.
The whole building's talking about it.
- What happened?
- You haven't heard?
No.
- Well, never mind.
- No, no, no.
What?
Well, after dinner last night, my hip was getting kind of stiff, so I went down to the hot tub.
You know how it is when you kick on the jets and your trunks fill up - like a hot-air balloon.
- No, but go on.
Well, nobody's around, so I just slipped out of them and tossed them on the deck.
- You mean, you were?
- Yeah, just floating free.
So I'm just sitting there, minding my own business and letting the bubbles do their work, and suddenly, old lady Langer shows up.
She sees my trunks and writes me out a "no-no" slip right there and then.
You mean the "no-no" slip was for being naked in the hot tub?
Yeah.
I told Dr Crane it was because you took Eddie in the elevator.
Oh, dear.
I've got to get down - to that condo meeting.
- Why?
I don't know what's going on down there, but suddenly I have a very queasy feeling.
Just what Ms Langer said when she tossed me my trunks.
And so you can vote for me, a person who has worked this past year to keep this building running smoothly, or you can turn the building over to a man who can scarcely keep his own family under control.
Thank you.
Fellow condo owners, I am sorry my opponent has chosen to be vindictive about my family, but that is merely characteristic of her behaviour during her entire term in office.
How else would one explain this?
This citation my father received last night is a perfect example of the pettiness of which this woman is capable.
We're all aware of your father's behaviour last night.
I'm surprised you're not too ashamed to bring it up.
Ashamed?
Not at all.
I defend his behaviour!
So he had his little friend out where he shouldn't be.
So what?
He's been doing it for years.
You approve of his behaviour?
Approve?
I applaud it.
Have you no compassion?
My father is getting older.
He hasn't many pleasures left in life.
I can't tell you the hours of joy that that little guy has brought him.
And not just him.
Who among us can't help but break into a smile upon seeing the little fella?
Oh, I know, you know, sometimes it is irksome when his little Eddie appears at inopportune moments He's named it "Eddie"?
Not exactly a name that I might have chosen.
I might have gone with something a bit more, I don't know, whimsical, like Oh, "Puck".
You know, the frolicsome sprite from Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.
Oh, don't look so shocked.
Whom does it really harm if he unleashes Eddie once in a while?
It's not as though he's alone in such behaviour.
Mrs Tornquist, I've seen you do the same thing with your Fluffy.
You know, if you ask me, not only is his behaviour harmless, it's laudable.
Why, you should see the looks on the faces of the school children when he takes Eddie out by the playground.
What, what, what?
On the other hand, we all need rules.
Go, go, go!
Sorry about the knocker.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Roz.
None of these lights seem to be flashing.
Hey, what do you know.
I got the same thing over here.
- Well, who's our first caller?
- No one.
- Well, how much time do we have?
- None.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Well, I have some good news for you.
As today is the first sunny day we've had in a few weeks, it seems that all our lines are open.
So please call in.
No waiting.
Absolutely no waiting.
Oh, come on, somebody's marriage must be on the skids.
Somebody's career must be going badly other than mine.
Hey, how about all you agoraphobics?
I know you're not outside.
Oh, there's a call.
I'll take it.
I'll take it.
Hello, I'm listening.
ALICE : Hi, Dr Crane.
My name is Alice, and I'm usually a happy person.
But today, well, I just started thinking about all kinds of sad things.
My job isn't that exciting, my kids don't call me as often as I'd like.
Pretty soon I was in a full-blown funk.
Well, Alice, as today seems to be a bit slow, you know, I think I have a story I can tell you that might be of some help.
Do you have some time?
Well, it's 3:00, and I'm still in my bathrobe.
Perfect!
Well, it all started three days ago.
You see, my father was very concerned about his little dog, Eddie, so he had taken him to the vet.
So, what did the doctor say?
He's stumped.
I told him he's not sleeping, he's not eating, he's not even sniffing stuff.
Welcome news to Mrs Frobisher in 13B.
He said he can't find anything wrong with him physically.
Thinks it might be an emotional problem.
You know, I've heard they have therapists for dogs.
Do you suppose a dog psychiatrist could be the answer?
Only if the question is, "What is the most asinine thing we could possibly do"?
Maybe Eddie's just lonely.
You know, I was thinking maybe we could maybe get another Stop right there, Dad.
We are not getting another dog.
Oh, come on.
What could be more fun than having a little brother or sister - around the house to play with?
- I fell for that trick once, Dad.
Well, I'm gonna get this little guy home.
All right, I'll see you at home.
I want to pick up some beans before I go.
See you there.
Oh, wow.
There's a guy over there checking me out.
He's coming over here.
Get out.
No, it's too late.
Just pretend you're not with me.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Dr Kagen.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Oh, no, not at all.
- I don't even know who she is.
- Frasier.
- Hi, I'm Roz Doyle.
- Dr Stephen Kagen.
Yes, Dr Kagen moved into my building about three months ago - from Chicago, I believe.
- Yes, that's right.
I love what I've seen of Seattle, but I'm still finding my way around.
Well, Roz is an excellent tour guide.
Really?
Well, if you have an afternoon sometime, maybe you could show me all the hot spots.
Oh, I think that could be arranged.
I'd be happy to.
I'm free tomorrow afternoon.
- Here's my card.
- Great.
I'll give you a call.
- Nice meeting you, Roz.
- Nice to meet you.
Dr Crane.
- Dr Kagen.
- Thank you, Frasier.
- My pleasure.
A gorgeous doctor, and I didn't get you anything.
- So, what kind of doctor is he?
- A gynaecologist.
That's not funny.
- What's the matter?
- He really is?
Oh, God.
I can't go out with a gynaecologist.
Do you know what they do all day?
I have a general idea, yes.
All right, I'll see you at home.
- Hey, would you date a gynaecologist?
- Oh, God, no.
- See?
- Yeah, I wouldn't even date a dentist.
Hands in people's mouths all day.
And after watching Eddie's complete physical, I'm not anxious to date a vet anytime soon either.
I thought familiarity with a woman But that's really more of a sidetrack.
Getting back to our story, by the time I got home that day, alas, poor Eddie was no better.
Hey, look, Eddie, Mr Carrot.
He'll give you good eyesight.
And a lot of fun with this too.
- Dad.
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
I went out, and I bought a bunch of new toys for Eddie.
I just thought it might cheer him up, you know.
Hey, Eddie, look at this.
Hamburger.
Juicy.
Meaty.
I'll bet you'd like a bite of this, wouldn't you?
No?
Well, more for me.
I sure hope you don't take a bite out of the other side.
Did you ever see anything sadder than this?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh, that will be Dr Crane.
He said he was gonna bring his dog over.
Oh, not that four-legged Maris.
Dad, please.
Don't call it that in front of him.
He has no idea.
How could he not?
It acts like Maris, it barks like Maris.
Aside from the fact that it eats now and then, they're dead ringers.
Hello.
Hello, Daphne.
- Hello, all.
- Niles.
I heard Eddie was down, and I thought a playmate might cheer him up.
So voila.
Well, I appreciate the offer, Niles, but I already tried it in the park with real dogs, and it didn't work.
Well, you'll change your tune when you see my girl turn on her charm.
All right, come on, girl.
And go to Eddie.
Go to Eddie.
Okay.
Do your stuff.
That's it.
Oh, oh, I can see her magic working already.
No, girl, come back here.
Girl?
Come back here this instant.
Okay.
Oh, Eddie, it's breaking my heart seeing you like this.
How would a nice big batch of Grammy Moon's sugar biscuits sound?
Do you believe he can understand a word you're saying?
Hey, I read somewhere dogs can understand up to 400 words.
Now, a supersmart dog like Eddie probably knows 1,000.
- Oh, really, Dad?
- Yes, really.
Eddie understands more than you give him credit for.
Yeah, why, just yesterday I said, "Eddie, I've lost my keys".
And he looked up at me - Eddie.
- Eddie.
Yackety yackety.
Yadda yadda yadda yadda.
Eddie.
Yadda yadda yadda yadda.
Eddie.
Eddie.
Eddie.
Eddie.
Eddie.
Understanding anything other than the simple fact of his name or a grunt.
Well, the crisis has passed.
She just needed a little rest.
Fortunately, I remembered to bring her sleep mask.
- How's Eddie?
- Worse.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to call in one of those dog psychiatrists.
- Dad, you can't be serious.
- Well, I'm desperate.
- We tried everything else.
- A dog psychiatrist?
Honestly, Dad, they are the very definition of charlatanism.
You simply cannot apply the principles of human psychology - to animal behaviour.
- Precisely.
Animals operate out of instinct, whereas human beings can reason.
- Yes.
- They can cogitate.
Yes.
Therefore, a human being, through analytical psychotherapy, can  Dad.
Dad.
Dad, yadda yadda  Well, it's the intrinsic value in, what, Gestalt therapy and Thank you for staying with us through the first commercial break.
We're talking to Alice, who has a case of the blues today.
In order to help her through it, I am relating a story from my own life.
Any questions so far, Alice?
Well, I was wondering, what happened to Roz and the gynaecologist?
Well, since Frasier did tell the most embarrassing part of the story, something kind of funny did happen.
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
You were at Camp Lakeridge too?
- What years were you there?
Roz.
Roz.
We are trying to help this woman.
We don't have time for your pointless tangents.
Anyway, my father finally got his way and made an appointment with a dog psychiatrist, who insisted that the entire household be present for the first session.
What's keeping this guy?
He should have been here by now.
Perhaps he's been detained by his fear-of-fetching group.
All right, now, you two cut it out!
- Hello, I'm Dr Arnold Shaw.
- Hi, doc.
Marty Crane.
Come on in, please.
This is Daphne Moon and my sons, Frasier and Niles.
How do you do?
- And this, of course, is the patient.
I don't suppose my father told you, but my brother and I happen to be psychiatrists.
Oh, how nice.
I always enjoy being in the company of colleagues.
I'm sorry.
Did you say "colleagues" or "collies"?
Oh, it's just a joke.
It's very clever.
Very clever.
Well, shall?
Shall we begin?
Hello, Eddie.
I'm Dr Shaw.
And I'm here to get to know you and help you get better.
You're very sad, aren't you?
It's okay to be sad.
Sometimes I'm sad too.
We're gonna spend the next hour trying to figure out why you're sad.
When you give a dog an hour, you can bill him for seven.
I'm sorry.
I get the feeling that some of us aren't taking this seriously.
Look, I apologize.
This all just seems a bit silly.
Oh, really?
Silly?
I'll have you know I just attended the funeral of one Buttons McFarland, whose owners felt the same way.
Knock it off!
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
First, I'd like to administer a dog personality-profile quiz I've developed.
My first questions are based on how you think Eddie might behave - if he were a human being.
- Oh, boy.
It's not a joke.
This is very serious.
If human Eddie were planning a dinner party, what might he serve?
I'd say meat loaf.
But not the plain kind.
The one with that fancy tomato-soup glaze on top.
Might be a bit underdone, though.
He has trouble reaching the knobs on the stove.
Poached salmon.
I don't know why.
Interesting.
Question two.
What would you imagine human Eddie's first words to be?
Well, I hope, "Give me a breath mint".
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right, next one.
What do you imagine would be human Eddie's favourite cologne?
Aqua Velva.
It's a little strong, but I think he can pull it off.
Grey Flannel.
I don't know why.
Cologne?
Well, actually, I think he would prefer toilet water.
Oh, by the way, same answer for favourite beverage.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
I'm sorry.
I just don't see the point.
What is any of this telling you about Eddie?
The point was not to learn about Eddie, but to learn about all of you.
And might I say, mission accomplished.
Well, perhaps now would be a good time for me to examine Eddie one-on-one.
Is there a room I can use?
Oh, yeah.
My room.
Second on the right.
Eddie, after you.
This may take a while.
If Eddie were one of the Beatles, I think he'd be George.
I don't know why.
And yet she's never been committed.
I don't know why.
Okay, I'll say it.
What have they been doing in there for the last hour?
He's probably just talking to him.
Eddie happens to be complex and interesting.
Oh, yes.
You must remind me to sit beside him at his next dinner party.
Well, be prepared.
He'll be up and down checking on that meat loaf.
I have my diagnosis.
- Finally, the white smoke.
Eddie is indeed depressed.
Now, if, as you say, there's been no change in his routine, I can only surmise that he's reacting to someone else's unhappiness.
Is any one of you suffering from depression?
- Not me.
- Well, I'm not depressed.
- Me either.
- I'm cheer personified.
Well, he's picking it up somewhere.
To be on the safe side, you should all be conscious of how you behave when you're in front of him.
Try to speak in pleasant, happy tones.
Goodbye, Eddie.
Call me in a few days, let me know how he's doing.
Okay.
Thanks for everything, doc.
Sorry to rush off, but I have a 4:00 appointment at the zoo.
There's a hyena there that won't even crack a smile.
See, I can joke too.
- Hold it.
- Oh, my God.
Roz, what's happened?
I wanna kill myself.
Oh, hey, Roz, not in front of Eddie.
- What?
- That gentleman that just left - was a dog psychiatrist.
- He said it'd be a good idea if we all had a happy tone when we're around Eddie.
So please, tell us, why do you want to kill yourself?
Well, I went out with Dr Kagen, and we Everything was going so great that I almost forgot what he was.
What is he?
- A gynaecologist.
Oh, gee.
I don't think I wanna hear any more about this.
All right, Roz, what happened?
Well, we went upstairs to his apartment, and he poured a glass of wine and Well, do you know what a speculum is?
Apparently, he was an avid collector of antique gynaecological equipment.
I've just gotten the signal from Roz that we're running out of time, so I'll skip ahead in our story.
If you ask me, the man's theory's a whole lot of hooey.
Who here has any reason to be unhappy?
Well, mind you, I would never say this if it weren't for Eddie's sake, but comparatively speaking, Dr Crane, you have the most to be depressed about.
What with your separation from Mrs Crane and all.
Well, I'm not unhappy.
Besides, I don't even live here.
Oh, please, you're here more than I am.
You know, I hate to say it, but, Dad, if anybody's giving off unhappiness, I'm afraid it's you.
- Me?
Yes.
You're the one who hasn't had a date in a year.
- Not to mention two failed marriages.
- And yet you did.
Well, I don't know, maybe I am not entirely happy.
Why should I be?
My son lives across the country.
There's no woman in my life.
Maybe it is I who is making Eddie sad.
Oh, now, now, don't you take all the blame.
If I give my life a good once-over, I realize it's not all jam.
I've just lost the only boyfriend I've had in years, and the biggest thing in my life is that I got all my hair cut off months ago, - and no one's even mentioned it.
You got your hair cut off?
Oh, shut up.
Daphne, maybe you were right earlier.
I'm not so happy.
Oh, maybe it's me.
My life hasn't been a picnic since Hester died.
Now that I think about it, what have I got to be happy about?
I mean, I know that has nothing to do with Eddie, but maybe Frasier picked up something from contact with me.
He wouldn't be the first one who Oh, I'm too depressed.
How loosely woven is the fabric of our happiness.
A tug or two, and it unravels to reveal how empty our everyday lives really are.
Then there are the empty nights accompanied by thoughts of loneliness and death.
You think about that too?
- Thought it was just me.
- Everybody thinks about it.
Do you lie real still and hold your breath and pretend you're in the ground?
No, that's just you.
When I die, I want it to be on my 100th birthday, in my beach house on Maui, and I want my husband to be so upset he has to drop out of college.
You know, I once had a psychic tell me the strangest thing.
That one day I would go off me rocker, take up a kitchen knife, kill the entire household and then kill myself.
Silly old bag.
She was right about my moving to Seattle, though.
Well, I don't know how I wanna go, but all my years around the police morgue taught me a few things.
First off, you don't wanna swallow Drano or rat poison.
And if you're gonna kill yourself with an axe, get it right the first time.
Well, you know, we can talk about it, we can think about it but nobody really knows how or when.
One second we're as alive as anyone else, and then what?
Darkness.
Nothingness.
Afterlife?
I've always liked the notion of meeting the great figures of history.
Then I think, what if it's like high school, and all the really cool dead people don't wanna hang out with me?
Mozart will tell me he's busy, but then later I'll see him out with Shakespeare and Lincoln.
I don't know about you, but this is depressing the hell out of me.
Remember, my number's coming up sooner than you guys.
Wow, that's right.
That's a good point, yeah.
No, no.
None of us really knows when our time is up.
And it's never long enough.
My great-grandmother was and her last words to me from her deathbed were, "It's so short".
Of course, it was the '70s.
She could've been talking about my skirt.
I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker T.S. Eliot.
Dead.
Must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death?
Plato.
Even deader.
You know, perhaps Dr Shaw was right.
Perhaps we are the cause of Eddie's depression.
Simple beast.
He has peered beneath the masks of happiness we all wear and seen what lurks below, infected by our sorrow.
His once carefree doggy world has been shattered, perhaps forever.
Well, look at him.
He's happy again.
Could that have been all it was?
He was missing his favourite doll?
Well, I guess Dr Shaw was wrong after all.
He wasn't taking his cue from us, was he?
Well, we were certainly taking a cue from Eddie.
- I've never been so depressed.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I wish I was a dog.
All it takes is a little toy to make him happy again.
I'm afraid we're a bit more complex than that, Daphne.
We know for whom the bell tolls.
Anybody else hear that?
Oh, the biscuits.
Daphne, by "biscuits" do you mean cookies?
- Yeah, that's right.
Oh, they smell good.
Yeah.
Fresh from the oven.
All nice and warm.
Yeah.
And I have a fresh pitcher of milk for dipping.
Oh, and I believe there's ice cream too.
Ooh!
And so, Alice, even the happiest of us can find reasons to be unhappy if only we look for them.
So don't look for them.
Take a tip from our dog friends, and treat yourself to your favourite toy.
Whatever that might be.
I'll do that right now.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
I really do feel better.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, reminding everyone that life is too short to dwell on every bump in the road.
Try to take pleasure in the simple things.
In short, eat a cookie.
Ow!
Oh!
Walnut.
I broke a tooth.
Oh, now I gotta go to the dentist.
Gonna tell me I haven't flossed, my lip's gonna get all fat.
My life sucks.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Well, listeners, flu season is upon us again.
As is customary, KACL is offering its employees and their families free flu shots.
Now, in order to show the importance of getting a flu shot, I am going to put aside my lifelong fear of needles and be inoculated right here over the air when we come back.
I've been sitting out here a half an hour.
I got places to go.
Well, Dr Claman is on his way, Dad.
Frasier, are you really afraid of needles?
Not really.
I just say that to encourage people that are.
Well, they can use the help.
You know, those needles they use are about this long, - and if it hits a nerve when it's going - Stop it, Roz.
Shots are perfectly harmless.
You got nothing to worry about.
Oh, sure, you hear the occasional story about someone getting an air bubble in their vein or the needle getting stuck in a bone and the tip breaking off, but that's the exception.
Oh, that's it.
We're out of here.
But what about my flu shot?
I always get a flu shot.
You're not getting one today.
You told me you'd drop me off at McGinty's.
Now, I told Duke I'd meet him at 5:00 sharp, and he pouts if I'm not there on time.
Sits there with his bottom lip stuck out and eats all the Brazil nuts out of the bowl because he knows I like them.
So come on, let's go.
It's nice to know men in bars still settle their disputes the old-fashioned way.
- Dr Crane.
- Oh, Dr Claman.
Sorry I'm late.
My last patient was a bleeder.
Oh.
- Fifteen seconds.
- Where are my manners?
Perhaps Perhaps you should get inoculated first.
I already had my shot, but I could sure use a check-up.
- You're on.
- Oh, right.
All right, folks.
Uh, we're back, um.
Joining us for this last minute of our show is Dr Morris Claman, who is going to give me my, my flu shot.
But you know, what's the rush?
Perhaps we'd be interested in finding out what strains of flu you've isolated this year.
Primarily Singapore, Rangoon and Malayan.
Would you roll up your sleeve?
And how do you suppose they travelled here?
No idea.
Roll up your sleeve.
Could it have been a careless tourist?
A, a baggage handler?
A tainted wok?
Dr Crane, we're almost out of time.
You do wanna get that shot, don't you?
Yes, yes.
All right.
First, I'm just gonna swab the area with a little alcohol, and then I'm gonna give you the shot.
There, that's done.
Really?
Well, that didn't hurt at all.
This is the newly immunised Dr Frasier Crane signing off.
No, no, that was just the alcohol.
This is the needle.
Ah!
Well, you're late.
All the tables are taken.
No, there's one right there.
Dibs on that table.
Roz, Niles was here first.
No, but I'm meeting someone.
Please, guys?
Oh, who is it?
Another one of your till-dawn-do-us-part relationships?
No, twerp.
This is a guy who I think really has a chance.
I can sense a lot of chemistry between us.
- Morris!
- Hi.
Dear God!
When did you two even get out of my sight?
You blacked out for 30 seconds after he gave you the shot.
Well, no one is budging.
We could be here forever.
Well, Niles, I suppose we could share a table.
There's a couple of seats available there.
Oh, good Lord.
We can't sit with strange women.
Why not?
We married strange women.
It's I know.
- Really, I'm not in the mood.
- You know, just try to relax.
Do you good to do something spontaneous for a change.
Yeah, I just I just I wouldn't know what to say.
- And besides, I'm a married man.
- Oh, Niles, please.
When will you get rid of that tired old excuse, your off-again, off-again relationship with Maris?
Come on.
Hello, ladies.
Excuse me.
Would you mind terribly if we joined you until another table opens up?
Oh, please do.
Oh, thank you so much.
That's very kind.
I'm Frasier, and this gentleman dusting for fingerprints is my brother, Niles.
I'm Laura, and this is Beth.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
Laura.
Niles.
Beth.
Niles.
What do you two ladies do?
Oh, you don't wanna hear about it.
- Well - Why don't we?
Oh, it's just boring.
To the guys, anyway.
Their eyes just glaze over when the subject comes up.
Oh, come on, come on.
We're not your average bozos off the street.
Why don't you try us.
We design kitchens.
On the contrary, I am always ready to debate the merits of downdraught cooktops and ceramic-tile backsplashes.
Whoa.
Whose little boy are you?
Ha!
As in just the mention of a double-bowl stainless-steel sink with integral drainboards makes me hum like a subzero freezer.
You know, I think the key to a good kitchen is comfort.
Well, that's a whole current trend, a living-room feel in the kitchen.
Except, of course, with our father, who favours a kitchen feel in the living room.
That's funny.
You're very witty.
Thank you.
- Look, Niles, a table's opened up.
- No, don't.
Stay.
Yeah, this is fun.
Well, yes, it is fun, isn't it, Niles?
Well, I told you it would be.
Why don't I go get us some coffees.
Uh, you know.
I, uh.
I uh I'll help.
I knew you'd panic.
Well, I'm sorry.
This is still a little new for me.
And besides, those two are coming on to us.
- You know, they are very attractive.
- I know.
Maybe we should ask them out.
On a date?
We just met.
Good point, Niles.
Perhaps we should go out with them a few more times before we ask them on a date.
I just mean it seems a little rash.
Well, that's exactly why we should do it.
We're being spontaneous today.
It will do us good.
I am enjoying this, and All right, I'll do it.
Oh, but wait!
We're making an assumption here.
We could both be interested in the same woman.
Good Lord, I hadn't thought of that.
All right, I'll declare l'm interested in Beth.
Good, good.
We really dodged a bullet there.
- Oh, which one's Beth?
- Oh, it's this one here.
- Great!
- Okay.
- And here we are.
- Yeah.
Oh, Frasier, what a great apartment.
Well, it's just a little something I threw together.
You know, an objet here, an antique there.
And there's the chair.
Wow, he wasn't kidding.
- Oh, hi!
- Dad.
Dad, meet Beth Armstrong and Laura Paris.
- Martin Crane.
- How are you?
Please have a seat.
Sit down.
Yeah.
So you've been out on a double date, huh?
Well, sort of.
We met this afternoon, and the next thing we knew, your sons were taking us out to dinner and then to the Seattle Rep.
- What'd you see?
- The Man Who Came to Dinner.
It's about a bad-tempered invalid that moves into these people's house and just drives them crazy.
- Comedy?
- I used to think so.
Well, Mr Smart-Aleck, as a matter of fact, I was just about to do a favour for you.
Sherry and I can't make it to the mountains this weekend, and the cabin's already paid for.
I thought maybe you'd like to use it.
Oh, thank you, Dad.
But Laura and I have plans to go to the symphony.
How about you, Niles?
Beth and I are attending an art opening.
Well, if you hear of anybody Nice meeting you, ladies.
I'm really glad the boys brought you over.
And it's been a long time since I said that and meant it.
Well, Dad wasn't really thrilled with the women we married.
Yes.
Fortunately, my taste has improved a lot since then.
I think your taste is fabulous.
I'm referring to the brandy, of course.
Velvety texture, great body.
I'm not.
Well, in honour of what happened today, a toast.
To winging it.
What greater thrill is there than going down an unknown path, not quite sure where it will lead.
Just enjoying the way that path wends and -  And, and, uh - Uh-huh.
And what it looks like and, and where it goes off to, uh Perhaps you should have left a trail of bread crumbs before you started down that toast.
You know, Frasier, I hate to see you miss a weekend in the country just to take me to the symphony.
We can go next week.
Wait a minute.
I have a thought.
Spirit of spontaneity has carried us this far.
Why don't we postpone our plans and all go to the cabin together this weekend.
- I'd love that.
- Sounds like fun.
Well, then, it's settled.
Saturday morning we ride the high country.
Say, you two have been here five minutes, you haven't seen Frasier's kitchen yet.
- There's really nothing special - Let's let the professionals judge.
- I am kind of curious to take a peek.
- Well, peek away.
Peek away.
Yes, someday, when you speak of his faux-granite countertops, and you will, be kind.
You are so funny.
- What's going on?
- Well, things are going rather fast.
Just going out this evening was a big step, but something that involves packing a suitcase, - and given my situation, I can't - Niles.
When are you gonna stop letting Maris be an anchor?
That's the most tortured metaphor you've come up with.
- Maris, an anchor?
- Oh, please, Niles.
Well, the woman is light weight, for God's sake.
Oh, just stop it.
You're changing the subject.
This afternoon, for the first time in your life, a perfectly lovely woman whom you don't even know has agreed to go away with you on a weekend.
Isn't that exactly the kind of scenario you've always dreamed of?
Yes.
And if you pass it up, won't you regret it?
Yes.
Well, then, for once in your timid, risk-free life, don't you think it's time you grabbed for that brass ring?
It's a great kitchen, Frasier.
You guys feel like firing up the cappuccino maker?
Yes!
Of course, if I have that much caffeine at this hour, it'll probably be Yes!
Ah, there we are.
After you, ladies.
Oh, this place is perfect.
And don't you just love this air?
Oh, I am going to sleep like a baby.
Me too.
Jeez, I hope you two don't mind roughing it.
There's no radio or television.
Well, I guess we'll just have to make our own entertainment.
We should be able to manage that.
Come on, let's go look around outside.
We'll start the fire, and we'll be right out.
- Yes.
-  Okay.
Well, Niles, I think things are going rather well, don't you?
Yes, they are, and thank you for twisting my arm.
Feel like a new man, do you?
I feel like a new woman, and thank God I remembered to pack one.
You know, I just wish I were sure that Beth and I were on the same page.
I've forgotten how to read all the signals.
Niles, you don't need a decoder ring to understand the phrase - "make our own entertainment".
- I know.
Then again, there was that other statement about sleeping like a baby.
Exactly.
They could be thinking platonic.
The two of them in one room sleeping like babies.
The two of us in another crying like babies.
Well, we're all adults.
I suppose we could just ask them what they have in mind.
That'd be the worst thing we could do.
What if they're not interested?
Then we'd all be embarrassed.
It would ruin the entire weekend.
I know.
Their luggage will tell us.
We'll put my bag in with your date's and your bag in with my date's.
They'll see the mistake.
- Right.
- How they correct it will tell with whom they were planning to spend the night, each other or us.
And either way, it'll all look like a misunderstanding.
You've done this before!
Only on my honeymoon.
Now, hurry.
Niles, this is idiotic.
We're both trained psychiatrists.
Yes, and finally it's paying off.
- Oh, Frasier, this place is heaven.
-  Yes.
Why don't we open up a bottle of wine and watch the sunset?
You know, the sun won't be setting for a little while yet.
Just think how much more we'll enjoy it if we got all our unpacking done first.
Oh, that can wait.
By the way, Beth and I were talking, and I don't know what you guys had in mind for tonight, and sorry if this sounds kind of forward, but we would like to avoid an awkward, uncomfortable situation by getting this out in the open right now.
When we go out to dinner tonight, it's on us.
Oh.
- Well, that's, that's awfully nice of you.
- Very.
Yes.
Um, speaking of awkwardness Um, uh, you know Look at that sunset.
- Are you as crazed by this as I am?
- It's driving me out of my mind.
All right then.
We're gonna settle this once and for all.
Now, just follow my lead.
Yes, that is lovely, isn't it?
It's magnificent.
Not feeling so hot, huh?
What'd the doctor say?
He says I've got Oh, what was that medical term he used?
Oh, I remember.
Flu.
God, I'm really sorry I didn't let you get that flu shot.
Is there anything at all that I can do for you?
Well, when I was a little girl and got sick, Grammy Moon used to read me to sleep.
- It was a great comfort.
- Oh.
- Is this what you're reading?
- Mm-hmm.
The Rose and The Rapier?
Well, if you're not in the mood   you don't have to.
- No, no, I'll do it.
- The bookmark's where I left off.
- All right.
Okay.
"With a gasp of dismay, she ran to him, her amethyst eyes wide with alarm.
'You fool,' she hissed, 'suppose someone saw you?
The duke's men are everywhere".
' This isn't so bad.
Told you.
"'You fool,' she whispered again, 'you sweet, brave, wonderful fool.
I should have died had you not found my bed chamber".
' Oh, jeez.
"Then she was in his arms, and all her qualms forgotten as she tore his tunic asunder and thrust her eager lips against the sinews of his naked chest.
- The next morning" - You left out a section.
Okay, okay.
"As his brazen fingers peeled the silken fabric from her heaving bosom he beheld her quivering alabaster mounds.
At that moment, she felt the proof of his rampant passion against her milky thighs.
His almost godlike beauty was marred only by the fact that he was" Cross-eyed, 3 feet tall and had breath like owl droppings.
Is there anything more relaxing than just lazing by a fire with a glass of wine?
Nothing I know of.
You two must be relaxed, sitting there so calmly when there's still all that unpacking to do.
Niles, we didn't bring that much.
Yeah, we didn't think we'd need too many clothes this weekend.
Well, I hate to break things up, but I'm getting a little sleepy, - so I'm gonna get ready for bed.
- Yeah, it is getting kind of late.
- You finished with that?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Niles.
I can't take this anymore.
These women are as inscrutable as sphinxes.
Yes.
Since we got here, all they've done is sent us the most veiled, cloaked, cryptic messages.
Can't they just give us one clear signal?
Well, I'm off to bed.
Niles, are you coming?
- Curse these infernal riddles.
- Niles!
So she really said what I thought she said?
Yes!
Go!
Suitcase.
Suitcase.
And there you are.
- Sleep well.
- Oh, you too.
- Niles, what are you doing?
- Oh, uh, never mind.
Yes, is Mrs Crane there?
Yes, I'll hold.
What is that, some sort of weird, kinky foreplay?
- I'm starting to feel guilty about this.
- Now?
I'm sorry, I just need to clarify the ground rules of Maris and my separation.
Oh, fine, fine, I think you may look back on this one day as your darkest hour, but you do what you want to.
Yes, Maris.
Uh, It occurred to me, uh, you know, we, we, uh, never laid out the rules about our dating other people - and what we could and couldn't - Niles, what are you doing?
Coming.
L Well, no, here, here's the thing.
I, I know that we're allowed to see other people.
Uh, my question is, how much of them are we allowed to see?
Oh, be right with you.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, really?
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
That's, that's, that's all I needed to know.
Thank you.
- Yes?
- You were wrong.
Maris says she doesn't mind at all.
Ah!
Well, then, off you go.
Let the revels begin.
What?
What?
Why doesn't Maris mind at all?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Just a second.
It's Niles.
I'll be a moment.
Why do you care?
Well, because she could've taken a lover herself, and this is her way of alleviating her guilt.
Okay, Niles, what do you wanna do?
You wanna stew over that all night?
- Let her have all the fun?
- Well, no.
No, of course not.
Well, then, off you go.
Hi.
-  Niles?
- Uh, momentito.
Hello.
Yes, Maris.
Well, I see, but All right.
Yes?
-  Frasier?
- I'll just be a second.
She's changed her mind.
She doesn't want me to go through with it.
Do you realize what's happening here?
Yes.
Your ex-wife is ruining my sex life!
Give me that!
Could I?
Uh, I What are you doing?
What?
What are you doing?
What if she changed her mind again?
How am I to know?
I am going to say this just one last time.
This weekend is not about thinking.
It's about doing.
Doing something that the Crane boys haven't done for a very, very long time.
For once in our miserable, sex-starved lives, can't we do something pleasurable without thinking it to death?
Don't think about today.
Don't think about what's right.
Don't even think of them as Laura and Beth.
For tonight, they are just two live, breathing, available female bodies who want us!
Think again.
Do you remember which snow bank you threw my phone into?
Oh, I think I could hit it again.
Frasier.
Frasier.
Frasier!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Oh, dear, your chair's got another big rip in the bottom.
Where?
Hand me my reupholstery kit, would you?
Thanks.
Oh, Dr Crane, don't you look smart.
I don't feel smart.
I've let Roz set me up on another one of her blind dates.
- Who's the lucky woman?
- Oh, a friend from her aerobics class.
Well, perhaps it won't be too bad.
She's 32, has a terrific body, apparently thinks I'm God's gift to broadcasting.
Well, at least you have one thing in common.
When will you stop blighting the environment with this atrocity?
My God, can't you see that it wants to die?
Let it go.
You know, I keep having this dream where you say the same words, only I'm in the hospital, and you're slipping the nurse a 20.
- Dad, that will never happen.
Thank you.
I have medical power of attorney.
It won't cost me a thing.
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
We were in the neighbourhood for a pedicure and a seaweed wrap and we thought we'd stop by.
- Of course, the pedicure was for - Stop right there.
There's no way to finish that sentence that'll make me proud.
I have some wonderful news.
I just signed a lease for an apartment in one of the most exclusive buildings in Seattle.
- You don't mean?
I do.
As of next week, I will be a resident of The Montana.
Niles, why would you even want to live in such a stodgy building?
When I applied there they treated me like riffraff.
If you're gonna ask and answer your own questions, what do you need me for?
The best part is I'll never have to give my address again.
From now on, I'll simply be Dr Niles Crane, The Montana.
That's a lovely building.
I've only been there once, applying for a job.
Can't imagine anyone turning down a chance to hire you.
Well, I hope you're right.
I haven't heard yet.
Well, good night.
- Hey, Frasier, you don't think she?
- Just relax, Dad.
It's just her way of angling for more vacation time.
But what if she isn't?
They'd have to call me for a reference.
Either way, she's not going anywhere.
Gosh, that's uncanny, Dad.
- What is?
- The way she's taken with you.
Look at that.
She's absolutely mesmerized.
- She is not.
- Oh, she is.
She's just playing hard to get.
Go to Grandpa.
Go to Grandpa.
Go to Grandpa.
Oh, hello, Grandpa.
Oh, yes.
Isn't she warm and cuddly?
I see I'm going to have a tough time tearing the two of you apart.
I'm gonna go out on a limb.
The Montana doesn't accept pets, does it?
On the contrary, they welcome them.
Just not cats or dogs.
Well, then you're in luck, because I don't know what the hell this thing is.
There's no way that dog is moving in here with us.
Please?
At least if she's here, I'll be able to visit her.
I cannot turn her over to strangers.
She worships me.
Oh, please.
You must realize that that dog has no genuine affection for you.
You only pretend that she does because she's a canine substitute for Maris.
That is the most absurd psychobabble I have ever heard.
She's high-strung, cold to the touch and ignores you.
My God, stand her upright, take ten pounds off her, put her in a Chanel suit, what have you got?
- I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.
- Is it really?
All right, here.
Remember the little pillbox hat that Maris wore to the Duchamps wedding?
Yes, well, I - Good morning.
- Hey, Frasier.
- So how did it go with Rita last night?
- She didn't quite take to me.
Oh, you're just being hard on yourself like you always are.
You tell me.
Over appetizers, she suddenly realized she had a very early morning meeting, suggested that we skip the jazz club after dinner.
People have meetings.
When the waiter suggested a soufflë that would take an extra 30 minutes, she said, "Oh, dear God, no".
She was probably on a diet.
After I dropped her off at home, I noticed that she'd left her suede jacket in my car.
I called to offer to swing it by, and she said, and I quote, "Just keep it".
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.
God, Roz, I have had it.
You know, in the past six months I have done everything a man can possibly do to meet a woman.
Singles bars, blind dates, a lecture series at the museum.
I've even spent hours in the grocery store trying to look helpless in the produce department.
That's it.
I'm taking myself off the market.
Frasier Crane has thumped his last melon.
You know, Frasier Roz, Roz, please, I know what you're going to say.
I should climb back up on that horse.
I'm too great a catch to give up now.
- No, I think you should give up.
- What?
Well, I don't really want to give up.
I was just saying that to get your sympathy.
Look, this happens sometimes.
When you're on a really bad streak, you start to get desperate.
Women can sense that.
They can smell it.
- Smell it?
- Mm-hm.
And trust me, when a guy starts to get overeager, you know, like complimenting you too much or laughing too hard at all your jokes, you just wanna turn and run.
- I don't do that.
- Oh, honey, wake up and smell Well, yourself.
You just need to air it out a little bit.
And in my experience, the minute you stop looking, the perfect person falls right in your lap.
Well, Roz, as much as I appreciate you comparing me to a dead squirrel in a heating duct, I think you're wrong.
- Hey, Roz.
Hey.
- I got that research you're looking for.
- Great.
- Hi, Dr Crane.
Hi.
Wow, you look really lovely today, Christine.
It is Christine, isn't it?
That's what it says on my driver's license.
That's very charming.
God, I reek, don't I?
- With inlay of Philippine mahogany.
And we conclude our little tour back here in the living room.
Oh, it's very posh.
Niles, why the bed in the living room?
It's not a bed, Dad.
It's an antique fainting couch.
My goodness, they had furniture for everything back then, didn't they?
Glad you made it.
Niles, this precious little building isn't as exclusive as you think.
Your doorman waved me right through.
- Well, that's because he knows you.
- Oh, a fan of my show?
No, he lives in your building.
So, Niles, what'd you do about the dog?
Oh, I found a wonderful family to adopt her.
Well, I'm sure it won't take you long to adjust to being alone again.
Actually, I won't have to.
Follow me.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
It was love at first sight.
She's very exotic, only eats every other day, and she's so white, she's almost blue.
Well, I'm getting nervous.
That's what he said just before he introduced us to Maris.
Everybody meet Baby.
I love you.
You bought a bird?
Well, I started to think how quiet it would be around here, and, well, she is lovely, and she's so affectionate.
I love you.
She says that all the time.
I love you too, Baby.
I love you, Grandma.
She's still in transition from her last owner.
Let go of my shoulder.
Let go of my shoulder.
Don't like that noise, do you, Baby?
Well, here, go to your food.
Go to your food.
Oh, good girl.
Excuse me.
Oh, you know, I've always been fascinated by these birds that can actually learn how to talk.
Oh, they can't talk.
They just drill a few words into them at the pet shop, and then they never learn anything else after that.
It is attractive, though.
Yeah, well, that's the way they are.
Cute, but stupid.
Cute, but stupid.
Daphne, perhaps we should just leave these two alone.
I sense a real battle of wits shaping up here.
Thanks so much.
Well, I'm off to an auspicious start in the building.
One of my neighbours got my mail by mistake.
Look at those bills.
What must she think of me?
But, Niles, everybody gets bills.
Not at The Montana.
They all have people.
Yeah.
Their bills go to their people.
I want them to think I have people too.
I used to have people, only they were Maris' people.
Niles, you keep this up, you won't even have the people who don't care you don't have people.
It just proves how essential it is to make a good first impression when you move into a new building.
Which is why I'm throwing a dinner party Friday night for a few select residents.
I'll show them such a good time, there'll be no question I belong.
- And I'm invited?
- Yes, you are.
But I'm afraid you can't bring a date.
You know how I hate a crowded table.
That's quite all right.
I've taken myself off the dating circuit.
Afraid I was getting a bit desperate.
Well, I was a bit concerned when you called to ask if Gloria was our first or second cousin.
Hey, Niles, you gotta see this.
Your bird's eating peanut butter.
It's even funnier than when Eddie does it.
Dad!
Frasier, would you get that?
And pretend you're my people.
Hello.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for Dr Crane.
I found some more of his mail.
Oh, well, I'm a Dr Crane.
I'm Niles' brother.
Oh, my gosh.
You're Dr Frasier Crane from the radio, aren't you?
- Oh, I love your show.
- Thank you.
- Stephanie Garrett.
- Stephanie.
You know, you are not gonna believe this, but when I was a freshman at Harvard, I saw you perform the Pirate King in their production of The Pirates of Penzance.
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, you were great.
I mean, you were so good that I brought my husband back to see you the next night.
Well, I mean, he wasn't my husband then.
Well, actually, he's not my husband now.
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, no.
That you came back, you know, the second time, not that you have an ex-husband.
You know, I have one too.
Well, no Ex-wife.
- My God, is it getting warm in here?
- Yeah, a bit.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- Right.
Wait.
You know, Niles is having a dinner party on Friday with some of his enchanting new neighbours.
Is there a chance you could join us?
Well, yes, I think I could if Niles has room.
The more the merrier.
Well, then, see you then.
- I'll look forward to it.
- As will I. Roz was right.
When I stop looking for the perfect woman, she lands in my lap.
I hope you're comfortable with that arrangement, because that's where she'll be seated Friday night.
Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.
- Now you try it, Baby.
Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.
What a quick little study you are.
Birdbrained, indeed.
You already know more French than my father.
Ow.
Boy, if you don't get used to that doorbell, we're going to have to give you a serious manicure.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Stop ringing.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Or should I say, "Avast ye, matey"?
I don't have time for your badinage.
I'm only just setting out my place cards.
Place cards?
Well, how elegant.
- And who is Peter Soutendeck?
- He is on your right.
He's an investment banker from Amsterdam.
Apparently, he handles a lot of Bill Gates' money, so don't say anything derogatory about the Netherlands or Microsoft.
Damn, there goes my opening joke about the Dutchman trying to install Windows 95.
Stephanie's over here.
I'm not next to her.
See, Peter's bringing a date, so I thought it would be better if you - What are you doing?
- I'm putting Stephanie next to me.
And throwing off my seating arrangement?
Niles, surely you realize that I've spent a long time looking for a woman like Stephanie.
Now, if you really want to impress these people, you've got to get a little more atmosphere in the room.
- I'll light a fire.
You dim the lights a bit.
- Oh, that's a good idea.
By the way, be careful with that fireplace.
It can be a bit   I'm so sorry.
Holding on a bit tight there, Baby, aren't you?
Okay, go to your perch.
Go to your perch.
Frasier, this bird's holding onto my scalp.
L I can't pull it off.
If you can pull off that jaunty beret you wore to brunch last Sunday, you can pull anything off.
- I'm sorry.
Let me try to help.
- All right, be careful.
Let me see what I can do.
Maybe I can just get the legs.
- Ow!
Ow!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- It just doesn't It's stuck.
Wait.
I know.
Get the lighter.
Fire frightened it onto my head, fire will frighten it off.
Let's try that.
- It's not working.
- Yes, it is.
- Stop it.
Stop it.
- Oh, all right.
- Oh, here, the phone.
- Oh, excellent, excellent, excellent.
- Hop on, Baby, hop on.
- No, Niles, just call someone for help.
And whom do you suggest we call, a fez rental?
Come on, Baby.
Go to your perch.
Go to your food.
Go to your bed.
- Niles, don't panic.
Try to stay calm.
- How can I stay calm?
I have six dinner guests arriving  Ow!
All right, listen.
You go call the vet.
I will take care of things out here.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
Please come in.
- I'm not early, am I?
- No, no, not at all.
- May I get you a drink?
- Yes, a white wine, please.
- Oh, what a lovely table.
- Yes.
Yes, I noticed that we happen to be sitting next to one another.
Good.
Then I won't have to change the place cards around.
Oh, well To the girl next door.
Well, actually, it's a little further down the hall.
Well, if you need a ride home tonight, don't hesitate to ask.
Ow!
What was that?
Well, I'm afraid Niles probably burned himself on something.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
Hello.
Oh, please, do come in.
I'm Frasier Crane, Niles' brother.
I'm Carol Larkin.
My husband Alfred.
This is our niece, Wella.
A pleasure.
Wella.
Nice to see you.
Welcome.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I'm just going to run into the kitchen and check on the bird.
So you've seen this sort of thing before.
I see.
- All right, well, thank you.
- What did he say?
Well, he thinks she was traumatized by the fire and went into a kind of shock.
He said we shouldn't try to force her off.
We need to relax her.
Fine, you take care of that.
I've got the future Mrs Crane in the other room.
- How do I relax this bird?
- I don't know.
Try delivering that keynote speech you gave at the Psychiatric Association last spring.
Everything all right out here?
- Will Dr Crane be joining us soon?
- Oh, yes, I believe so.
Any minute now.
Ow!
- Oh, dear, is something wrong?
I keep telling him, "Get yourself a decent oven mitt," but, you know Hello.
Please come in.
I'm Frasier, Niles' brother.
- Peter Soutendeck.
- Peter.
- This is Elaine Hensley.
- Elaine.
Actually, your brother and I are well acquainted.
Maris is a dear, dear friend of mine.
- Really?
- Yes.
So where is Niles?
Well, actually, he's in the kitchen preparing dinner.
He's favouring us tonight with a lovely pheasant.
As you know, he is a stickler for freshness.
Oh, what now?
I'm trying to pretend like it's night so it'll fall asleep.
Well, you look very cute.
Cute, but stupid.
Listen, I can't stall them much longer.
They're starting to ask questions.
The Dutchman's date even knows Maris.
- What?
Who'd he bring?
- An Elaine somebody.
Well, which Elaine?
Maris knows three Elaines.
Oh, I don't know.
She's very thin, she's exquisitely dressed and dripping with attitude.
Oh, like that narrows it down.
I was afraid of that.
It's the bad Elaine.
Maris' oldest friend.
Nothing would delight her more than report back to Maris that I threw a soiree with a cockatoo on my head.
Bon appetit.
- What was that?
- Bon appetit.
Crab puffs for everyone.
Bon appetit.
At which point, the woman said to Churchill, "Sir, if you were my husband, I would put poison in your coffee".
To which Churchill saucily replied, "Madam, if you were my wife, I would drink it".
Perhaps you've heard that story.
Yes.
From Churchill.
Well, can I freshen anyone's drink?
Perhaps I'll just bring the bottle around.
I didn't realize that you were gonna have to play host all night.
I mean, we've hardly had a chance to talk, and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to make it an early night.
- Oh, no, really?
- Yes, I'm leaving for Paris first thing in the morning, and I was really hoping that we could spend some time alone.
And so we shall.
As of this moment, it's just the two of us.
I'm completely at your disposal just after this.
Elaine, can I get you something?
Actually, I just thought I'd see what Niles is up to in there.
Perhaps I could be of some help.
Well, you know, you could pour the wine.
What are you doing now?
You're ruining my chances with Stephanie.
Yes, that was my first concern too.
Toss.
You can't abandon me just because you're hoping Stephanie's as horny as you are.
You've got to help me.
I suggest that first you get to the vet and have that removed.
Are you mad?
I can't walk in there with this on my head.
I'd be the laughingstock of The Montana.
You can't spend all night in the kitchen.
Frasier, these people live for gossip.
I've only been here three days.
Already I know that Peter's a letch and Carol's a lush.
What do you think they'll say about me?
I've spent 45 minutes with these people.
They happen to be very kind, understanding, and I think they'll be very sympathetic to your problem.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You don't think they'd laugh at me?
- No, I don't.
But if you stay in here, they'll think you're rude, ill-mannered, and dare I say it, a bad host.
Very well.
I'll go out there.
But if they ridicule me, let it be on your head.
Everyone, excuse me.
There's been a little mishap.
Niles is going to have to go to the doctor.
It's nothing serious, he just has to have something removed.
Niles.
You see, his bird suffered a kind of trauma and has attached itself to the scalp, and we were just thinking that we'd hate to cancel dinner, but Frasier, this isn't necessary.
Let's just go.
Good evening, everyone.
I'm very sorry for all of this.
Niles, you mean all this time you were hiding in there because of your bird?
Oh, you poor thing.
You know, the same thing happened to my mother once, only with her cat.
Now, that was a sight.
Who hasn't had an embarrassing moment at a party?
Look, I've just spilled wine on my dress.
This is such a relief.
I must say, I feel a little silly for staying in there so long.
Are you in any pain?
No, no, as long as no one rings the doorbell, I'm fine.
Well, you know, Niles, you seem to be relaxing a bit.
Maybe the bird will relax and Should we give this another minute or two?
Yes.
Well, all right then, who needs more wine?
Alfred, wine for you.
And would anyone like cheese or a cracker?
No, no, Baby, guests first.
Oh, Carol, that dress is absolutely smashing.
- Why, thank you.
Carol's a lush.
Did the bird just say something?
It sounded like it said  Carol's a lush.
Where would a bird learn a phrase like that?
Birds today.
You just don't know where they pick things up.
Well, shall we all join Peter at the table?
Peter's a letch.
- What did you say?
- I said, let's all sit down.
Peter's a letch.
Is this your idea of a joke?
I've had quite enough of this.
Come along, Carol.
No, please, people, don't go.
I did not teach the bird these phrases.
I don't know where it picked them up.
You'll stay, won't you, Stephanie?
Stephanie's horny.
Oh, my God, is that what you've been saying about me behind my back?
No, I never said that about you.
I said it about me.
I'm the horny one.
All I said was, you're very cute.
Cute, but stupid.
Well, thank you both for a wonderful evening.
- Good night.
- Please let me explain.
I know we got off on the wrong foot, but we are going to be neighbours  - Well, thank you very much.
- Oh, please.
- I've lost far more than you did.
- Oh, really?
I've lost the most promising romantic prospect I've had in years.
What have you lost?
The respect of a posh lush and a Dutch letch.
Try repeating that, Baby.
All right.
I apologize.
Thank you.
Perhaps I can drive you to the vet now.
Maybe we should take the service elevator.
Oh, what's the point?
I don't think my reputation can suffer any more than it already has.
I wouldn't be so sure about that, wearing a white bird after Labour Day.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Oh, did I mention, two members of my fear-of-commitment group have announced they're getting married.
Oh, congratulations.
There's a downside, though.
They're New Age types.
The wedding is to be held in the woods.
- So?
- I need a date.
You know how the women in my crowd tend to droop outdoors.
Yes, well, Niles, there are all different sorts of women in the world, you know.
Perhaps if you'd tiptoe beyond the fringes of your precious circle, cast a wider net.
Frasier, that woman by the side of the road spearing trash Not that wide.
No, no, no, it's Roz.
My God, it is.
If she realizes we've recognized her, she'll be utterly humiliated.
Oh, Roz?
Oh, my God.
You're not seeing me.
Go away.
Roz, what on earth are you doing here?
Just let me in.
- Wait, I'll spread papers.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you, Niles.
All right.
Okay, let's go.
What?
What do you mean "let's go"?
L I can't do that.
I don't even know why you're here.
About a month ago, I got stopped doing 60 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone.
It was either a huge fine or community service.
So here I am, and it's a nightmare.
Breathing exhaust fumes, using a spatula to scrape up roadkill.
Well, at least just look on the bright side.
You're outdoors.
You can enjoy nature.
- You're beautifying our highways - Frasier, I found an ear.
Was there no other service you could've performed?
The only other option was visiting old people in a retirement home.
And you chose this?
Think about it: Walking the streets, picking up trash You can see how Roz would go with the familiar.
Niles.
Old people just make me uncomfortable.
Roz, have you ever considered that your discomfort around the elderly may stem from your own fear of growing old?
Wow!
Do you think?
Oh, my God.
- What?
- It's my supervisor.
Hit the gas.
- I can't.
It might be illegal.
- Move or your brother gets it.
- Absolutely not.
- All right, the headrest.
Off we go.
Oh, well, Dad, doing your exercises.
Very good.
Just a little farther.
There you go.
Congratulations, Mr Crane.
You finally got your knee past your rib cage.
It's no big deal.
Well, it's more than Lilith could accomplish in five years of marriage.
You know, it's so gratifying to see your father make these little improvements.
It's days like this when I'm glad I took this position.
We're all glad you took this position.
You know, Daphne, I must say, there are some times I envy you.
Here you go, Niles.
You know, I'll just say that it's always gratifying to see some reward for your efforts.
Lately, that's something I've been lacking in my own work.
How so?
- Oh, well, you know, back in private practice I could spend months, even years with a patient, see the fruits of my labour.
Now, somebody calls in, I give my advice and never know how things work out.
I simply release my humble words in the airwaves, and then they're gone forever, vanished.
So like my Tiffany cuff links.
I'd hoped to wear them to my New Age wedding.
They've disappeared.
So you know my pain.
Well, I'm not really dissatisfied.
It's just that Well, Daphne, you know, you get to see your progress with Dad.
Niles, you have the upcoming marriage of your commitment-phobics.
Oh, come on.
You help people all the time.
- You helped me just the other day.
- How?
Well, I was worried because Eddie had lost his appetite, and you remember what you said?
If I remember rightly, I said, "Well, why don't you just give him some of my truffle foie gras".
Right.
I was being funny.
Oh.
Yeah, well, I knew that.
That just cheered me right up.
Come on, Eddie.
- Excuse me, Bulldog.
- What's up, doc?
Listen, have you seen Roz?
She's late.
My show goes on in 30 seconds.
You know what?
I'd dump her.
A little extreme, don't you think?
I fire everybody once a year.
Housekeepers, personal trainers.
Cut them off before they start copping an attitude.
Oh, oh, doctors are the worst of all.
You pick up the same disease three or four times, they start lecturing you like it's your fault.
You want a bite?
Not if you skipped it to me across a pool of disinfectant.
Hello, Seattle.
Good afternoon.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Today we're gonna do things just a little bit different.
For the past four years now, I've been taking your calls and giving advice.
And I was thinking, perhaps our listeners wonder how things have turned out.
I know I do.
So today I invite those of you who've called in in the past to give us a holler, and we can catch up on how things have worked out for you.
All our lines are open.
Come on.
Come on, you know the number.
There we are.
Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
How did I help you?
Hello, Dr Crane.
This is Chet from Whidbey Island.
I gave you a call last year.
I was having problems with low self-esteem.
I see.
And did my advice help you to become more assertive?
Damn straight.
Yeah, now people say I'm downright arrogant.
Well, you know what I say?
Screw them.
Well, perhaps you took my advice just a bit too far.
Who the hell are you?
Screw you too.
Well, as I give myself a well-deserved pat on the back and Chet marches off to invade Poland, let's just go to commercial.
Well, Roz, glad you could join us.
You're lucky I made it at all.
I took your advice and went down to that retirement home to finish off my community service.
It's a lot better than spearing trash, isn't it?
You tell me.
I started playing checkers with this old man, Mr Krantz.
Well, things got a little competitive, and he made a really bad move, and I said, "You're a dead man".
Oh, dear.
I think I see where this story's headed.
A minute later, he's lying sprawled across the board.
Pieces are everywhere.
The whole place is screaming.
When I pulled him up, he still had a checker stuck to his forehead.
Roz, I am so sorry, I Jeez, I can see how you could be very traumatized by this.
Hi, we're back.
That was a catchy little commercial, wasn't it?
Let's get back to it.
Roz, listen, you can't be too upset about this.
Now, given the circumstances, his age, and his surroundings, I mean, surely this thing was sort of expected.
Not with this guy.
The whole reason I liked him was he was so youthful and robust.
You should have seen him, Frasier.
He was raring to go.
He kept bragging about how good he was and how much fun it was gonna be.
Then he dies on me.
- Hey, it happens to all guys, okay?
- Bulldog.
No, no, no, this is a pet peeve of mine, doc.
Why is it always the guy's fault?
If you chicks needed a little less booze to get from maybe to yes, we'd be a lot more alert when the moment of truth arrives.
Bulldog, Roz was playing checkers with an elderly gentleman, and he died.
Oh, well Well, when I said we, I didn't mean me, because I don't have that.
Hey, you're a doctor.
That was confidential.
Well, I guess its back to scraping up roadkill.
Surely you realize what happened at the retirement home - was an aberration.
- Well, maybe so.
But I wasn't comfortable being around old people to begin with, and this hasn't helped matters.
Roz, listen, if you're ever going to conquer your fear of aging, get back down there and spend some time with these people.
You'll learn that they're really vital human beings.
- I'm still not convinced.
- All right, then think of it this way: There's been a lot of fog on the interstate lately, and the caribou are migrating.
"As the train whistle screamed and we started out of the station, I lowered the window and said, 'I'll be back.
' But somehow I knew I would never see her or Paris again.
The end".
That was a pretty good book, wasn't it, Mr Gouldenstein?
Mr Gouldenstein, you're feeling a little cold.
Can I make you a nice hot cup of Oh, my God!
Come on, boy.
You can do it.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Fras, look at that.
He's dancing.
- He's practically doing a polka.
Good.
That should up his price when I sell him to the carnival.
Hello.
- Hello, Daphne.
Back from the big wedding in the woods, huh?
Oh, yes, and don't you look nice.
Except, what's this sticky stuff all over your shoulder here?
- Did you finally find a date?
- I asked Maris.
- Sap.
- I think Daphne speaks for us all.
- Just how the hell did this happen?
- Well, I was desperate for a date, and I knew Maris would be lonely this time of year.
It's cruise season.
She never partakes.
She has an absolute terror of buffets.
Oh, yes, her legendary "smorgaphobia".
So how did it go?
Or how big a scene did she make?
Actually, she did quite well.
She willingly joined in the ceremonial chanting, and when the shaman invited those so inclined to embrace their favourite tree, Maris said the only tree she was willing to embrace was her family tree.
Everyone laughed.
Well, I laughed.
Then it happened.
- They called for a group hug.
- Oh, dear.
Last time I saw her, she was racing toward her Mercedes, emitting a high-pitched shriek that caused the wedding doves to attack one another.
I'll see if I can find something to remove this sap.
- Another one died.
What?
What happened?
What's she talking about?
Dad, Roz has been doing some community service down at a retirement home, and apparently, for the second time this week, one of her charges has died.
They're calling me the Angel of Death now.
Roz, you know this isn't your fault.
Maybe it is.
I've never been good with plants or animals.
Everything's always died on me.
You have a cat.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Roz, death is an occupational hazard of working with older people.
Trust me, I've lost more patients than I'd like to count.
You never said anything about that to me.
Didn't I?
Anyway, you just sit there, and I'll go make you a nice cup of tea.
Wait, how many patients did you lose?
Well, I don't know.
I used to keep a tally in me diary, but it made me a bit sad.
Was it more than five?
Now listen, Roz, there's no way that you can feel guilty about this.
I mean, those men were gonna die anyway, and you gave them some much welcomed companionship in their final moments.
It just seems so unfair.
One minute he's lying in the bed, smiling and happy, and ten seconds later it's over.
For heaven's sake, it happens to every man a couple of times in his life.
Why can't you women just take it as a compliment?
Look, I appreciate you coming down here with me, but I don't think I can make it.
Roz, we have discussed this.
This is going to be your breakthrough day.
- They hate me here.
- You're just overreacting.
There's no way they think you're the Angel of Death.
- I'm leaving.
- No, Roz, this is not like you.
The Roz I know is not a quitter.
She's a fighter.
I just can't help thinking it's going to happen again.
They always die in threes.
Oh, God, that's just celebrities.
Come on.
All right, in you go.
Just get Just get in there.
- Hi, I'm Roz.
- I'm Moira.
Come in.
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.
- Really?
Do you feel okay?
- Yes.
Now, do me a favour and hand me those cigarettes, would you?
You know, these things do come with a warning.
So do you, darling.
I let you in.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
Is that Dr Crane?
Yes.
Dr Frasier Crane?
- Yes.
- Have we met?
- No, but I thought that was you.
I recognise your voice from the radio.
I listen to your program all the time.
Norman Royster.
Well, it's my pleasure.
Are you here visiting somebody?
No, I'm just here with a friend of mine, Roz.
- She's doing some community service.
- Oh, the Angel of Death.
Nice gal.
You know, I remember one day I was listening to your program, and it was right after my wife died, and I was going through kind of a rough patch You told this guy who was going through the same thing that he should keep pictures of his wife around to help with the transition.
That was a good idea.
So you started keeping pictures with you?
Well, that wouldn't make much sense, now would it?
Well, no.
Well, what did you do?
Well, I remembered, when we were dating, Helen made this life mask of herself for art class, and I had my daughter dig through the attic, and, lo and behold, she found it.
This is the way she looked when we met.
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Oh, yes.
So you were right.
Every night, before I fall asleep, I run my fingers over Helen's beautiful face, and it takes me back to all those wonderful years we had together.
It made a world of difference.
I wanna thank you.
You really helped me.
You have no idea how nice it is to hear that.
Would you excuse me?
It's time for me to take one of my many pills.
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
- I just knocked your ashtray over.
- Well, I hope it wasn't damaged.
My grandson made that for me at summer camp.
Oh, no, it's intact.
Not the tiniest chip.
Oh, good.
Set it back on the table.
You know how attached you get to family things.
- Do you have children, Dr Crane?
- Well, yes.
Dr Crane, are you on the floor?
I was just tying my shoelace.
Yes, yes, I have a son.
I'd much rather hear about your family.
Well, I got four sons and one daughter.
You wouldn't happen to be single now by any chance, would you, Dr Crane?
As a matter of fact, I am.
So is my daughter.
I'll tell you about her first.
She's a sweet thing.
Beautiful too.
Just like her mother.
Same cheekbones, same nose.
And what a lovely nose it is.
So there are four of us in the raft, and I see we're heading into a patch of white water.
Suddenly, we slam into a rock, and the next thing I know, my teeth are flying into the Colorado River.
I damned near dived in after them.
Those teeth cost more than the whole trip.
- You've had quite a life.
- I suppose.
Never got arrested, though.
Oh, good for you.
It wasn't so great.
You know, it was the first time I ever got pulled over and couldn't flirt my way past it.
Oh, that's almost as bad as the first time somebody calls you ma'am.
That happened the other day.
It's been kind of a rough week.
I bet I know just what you're thinking.
"This is only the beginning.
It's only gonna get worse from here".
Well, yeah.
Let me tell you something.
I'm 81 now.
And every morning, I open my eyes, and I see the sun streaming through the window.
I hear the birds chirping.
I smell the coffee brewing down the hall.
And I walk into the bathroom, and I look into the mirror.
- Do you know what I say to myself?
- What?
What the hell is that?
That's the second thing I say.
The point is, it is only gonna get worse from where you are right now.
What did you want me to say?
Life gets better with every passing year?
You wanna hear that, you go talk to Mrs Adelman.
You can't miss her.
She's the one in the TV room with the inflatable seahorse around her waist.
Well, you're not making me feel any better, Moira.
Because I can't.
Nobody likes to get older, but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself.
I'll tell you a funny story.
Last Thursday, I hacked into the main computer here and changed the schedule.
So now I get all my sponge baths from Eduardo.
You're kidding me.
Look, you're way too young to be concerned about all this.
Don't waste the best years of your life worrying about something you can't control.
I know.
I know you're right.
You know, I wouldn't care about getting older if I thought my mind was gonna be as sharp as yours is.
Sharp?
I'll tell you a funny story.
Last Thursday, I hacked into the main computer here and changed the schedule, and now I get all my sponge baths from Eduardo.
With the exception of not being able to watch Willie Mays steal second, or Michael Jordan on a breakaway dunk, not a whole lot I feel like I missed out on.
Listen, have you got any glue around here?
I don't think so.
Why?
Well, the onyx has popped out of my cuff link, and I was just hoping I might be able to reaffix it.
The closest thing I have is denture adhesive.
It's on the dresser.
Oh, good, good.
Well, it's worth a try.
Oh, these pills may keep me alive, but they sure don't keep me awake.
- You find it?
- Yes.
Yes, you know, I think this just might do the trick.
You know, the worst part about all this is I used to be the kind of person who never got tired.
Well, you know, then, perhaps maybe we should take a brisk walk.
- Get that old circulation going.
- No, that's okay.
It's close to my bedtime anyway.
Seems like you have a visitor, Norman.
Come in.
Come in.
It's probably Mrs Adelman.
She was an Avon lady before she lost her mind.
Well, you know My goodness, that is a smashing robe.
I'm in the market for one like it.
Stand up.
Maybe I can read the label.
Come over here and have a look.
I seem to be sitting on something.
Oh, my cuff link.
All right, you know, here, I'll just place it back in here carefully and Well, there we go.
Good as new.
Yes, well, Norman, I can't tell you what a nice time it's been spending a day with you.
- It was nice of you to drop by.
- My pleasure.
Oh, you're over there.
Well, yeah, I was just having one last look at Helen.
Isn't she beautiful?
Such delicate features.
They certainly are.
Well, Norman, it was a real pleasure.
- I hope you keep listening to my show.
- I sure will.
You're a good man.
Not a lot of people left with your kind of integrity.
Norman I have a little confession to make.
I didn't I didn't drop your ashtray.
I dropped the mask.
And the nose broke off.
I feel just terrible.
Oh, that's why you needed my denture adhesive.
- Yes.
- Well, usually it works pretty well.
I must've dropped that mask ten times.
I am blind, you know.
Certainly is a relief to hear that.
Well, you know, I'd better get out of here before I do any further damage.
It was great meeting you.
Want me to leave the light on or off?
Surprise me.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
My 8-year-old son is visiting me this week, and he asked specifically if I could arrange a tour of the Microsoft complex.
I was wondering what your policy is on I'm sorry to hear that.
You know, I don't often trade on my celebrity status, but does the name Frasier Crane mean anything to you?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you know, it's entirely possible that one day a relative of yours may wish to tour my workplace It's a radio station.
Oh, forget it!
- Even been close, that would be one thing.
- But I beat that tag by a mile.
A mile.
- Calm down, slugger.
It's all right.
- A mile!
- I take it you lost the game.
No, we won the game, but Roz got kicked out for arguing with the ump.
She kicked dirt on his shoes, chest-butted him, almost took a bite out of his finger when he stuck it in her face.
You can't coach that kind of thing.
All right, there's a guy on second, one guy's out, I drive one to the gap.
The throw to the cut-off man is late, our guy's safe, I try to stretch it to a double.
I make a beautiful hook slide right under the tag.
How can I be out?
I'm still trying to understand why you drove to the Gap during the game.
Look, I'm gonna go work on the line-up for Saturday's game.
- You know, I love being in charge.
- Oh, can I play second base?
No.
Liz Budner's playing second.
Liz Budner?
Why?
What can she do that I can't?
It's what she will do that you won't.
Oh, Roz.
Listen, didn't you used to date some executive at Microsoft?
Scott Blankman.
Talk about your messy break-ups.
Even after I dumped the guy, he kept calling me.
At first, he'd make excuses: "Sorry, I hit the wrong button on my speed dial".
Then he gave up the pretence and there'd be sobbing - on the other end of the line.
- Oh, God.
I finally said, "Scott, I never, ever want to talk to you again".
- Why do you ask?
- I'd like you give him a call.
- What?
- Frederick's coming to visit this week.
The only thing he asked for was a tour of Microsoft.
I sort of already, well, promised that I could arrange it.
Frasier, you're asking me to call a man who camped outside my apartment building and held a big sign up that said: - "Roz Doyle is afraid to love".
- Okay, I understand.
I just thought you'd be more sympathetic, that's all.
I can't.
I do recall a story you told me not long ago about a young girl living in Wisconsin, who wanted desperately for her mother to drive her to Chicago to see Bobby Sherman open a shopping mall.
But her mother was just too busy.
What did that girl do that night?
She cried herself to sleep on her little Bobby Sherman pillow.
I hate you.
Niles.
- Good morning.
Is Frederick up yet?
He went out with his grandfather for an early morning walk.
I went through my old albums this morning and found photos of us when we were Frederick's age.
- Oh, Lord.
- Thought he might find them amusing.
Oh, here.
There we are, all dressed up, ready for our first Cub Scout hike.
And last.
Yes, well, we didn't exactly endear ourselves to the pack.
All the other kids had knapsacks, we showed up with those monogrammed train cases.
Niles, refresh my memory.
Why are we wearing plastic snouts and a tiny little wading pool around our waists?
You've forgotten.
That Halloween we went as the Bay of Pigs.
Ah.
As I recall, nobody got it.
I finally had to take to telling that we were Swine Lake.
They didn't get that either.
- That was a long evening.
- Yeah.
So, what do you have in store for Frederick this visit?
We're gonna go whale-watching, the planetarium, and Roz is helping me arrange a tour of Microsoft.
It's the one thing Freddie specifically requested.
Someone's running for Dad of the Year.
Yes, well, you know how it is.
I don't get to see him as often as I'd like.
Memories of this trip will have to last until the next one.
Can you blame me for wanting it to be perfect?
- Hi, Dad.
Oh, hello, Freddie.
Dad, did Grandpa ever tell you the story how he captured four bank robbers with just a nightstick?
No.
He did tell me how he captured two bank robbers with just a revolver, his partner and a SWAT team.
- They got there later.
Well - Hello, Uncle Niles.
Hello, Frederick.
My, aren't you getting big.
I'm the same exact size I was the last time you saw me.
Well, your mother's cooking will do that for a growing boy.
- Are we going to Microsoft today?
- Well, Freddie, I thought we'd go by the radio station.
I could show you where I work.
- That'll be fun, won't it?
- Yes.
- When are we going to Microsoft?
- Well, Saturday.
Excellent.
- Hey, good morning, Dr Crane.
- Good morning, Daphne.
- Hi, Daphne.
- Hello, Frederick.
Tell your dad what you saw in the park with Eddie.
Hi, Daphne.
- Frederick's my boyfriend.
- Oh, really.
I got a present for you.
Wait here.
That's so cute.
He's got a crush on you.
Yes, he spent the entire evening sitting on Daphne's lap, watching TV.
Really.
And this morning I heard this soft little knocking at my door, and it was Frederick, asking if he could climb into bed with me.
Really.
- It's for you.
Oh, well, isn't this lovely.
Look, here's Frederick.
And here I am.
- And what are we doing?
- Getting married.
Really.
Come on, Frederick, let's go hang this on the fridge.
Okay.
Do you think it's healthy for a little boy to be so obsessed with a woman he can't possibly have?
Niles, have you actually sunk so low as to be jealous of him?
No, I'm not jealous.
I'm just a bit Well, maybe envious.
That's ridiculous.
What have you got to be envious of?
Hold on!
Wee!
Wee!
And this is the booth where it all happens.
- Very impressive.
- Well This is the talkback button here, if I want to talk to Roz, the cough button if I want to mute the mike.
This button here is very special.
It sends a death ray shooting from the phone of any caller who annoys me.
You wish.
Yes, I do.
Well, okay, Roz, what have we done to ourselves today?
Well, we went out last night to celebrate our big win.
- Ah.
Had a few margaritas.
Someone started a conga line.
I wasn't gonna get in it.
I think Gary, our shortstop, got on the end of the line.
That man has a butt that makes you wanna reach out with both hands and give Freddie a great big Seattle hug.
- Good save, Roz.
Thank you.
- I don't believe you've met Bulldog.
- Hey, kid.
- Why are you called Bulldog?
- People just always call me that.
But why?
- I don't know.
- Well, all right, Bulldog.
- Roz and I have a show to prepare for.
- No, no.
Wait a minute.
This is important.
Why do people call me Bulldog?
There has to be a reason.
This is gonna drive me nuts.
Who's subbing for me in Saturday's game?
We gotta have a ninth body out there or we forfeit.
- Oh, right.
How about Mindy Guthrie?
- Eight months pregnant.
July, August, September, October, November, December Anyway, you better find somebody.
And speaking of bad news, Frasier, I finally got a call from Scott Blankman Roz Frederick, talk with Bulldog for a minute.
- I have to discuss something with Roz.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Oh, hey.
In a little while I'm gonna bring in my cart.
- You can hit the gong.
- Why?
It's loud.
I make a lot of loud noises in my show.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Boy, I'm starting to get a headache.
If you need a softball player, why don't you use my dad.
Oh, yeah, right.
Isn't he good?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's great.
He is the best, you know.
I wish he could play, but I think your dad's busy Saturday.
- He's taking me to Microsoft.
- Yeah, right.
Man, I wish he could play, because if he were playing, we'd win for sure.
I'm sorry, Frasier.
That's all I can do.
Scott quit Microsoft right after we broke up.
Well, I don't look forward to telling Frederick.
He'll be so disappointed.
Well, you know, if he wants a tour of a seminary, I've got an in there now.
I don't know.
I give up.
Abraham Lincoln.
What school did you go to?
Frederick  Dad, I don't wanna go to Microsoft anymore.
- You don't?
- Oh, hey.
Yes, he does.
Wait a minute.
What kind of boy wouldn't wanna spend a day at Microsoft?
Stay out of this.
Now, listen.
Frederick, you know, this is your vacation.
You are the boss.
Whatever you say goes.
Great.
I wanna see you play in the softball game.
- What?
- You could take Roz's place.
Well, you know, as much as I'd love to play softball, I really don't think that Bulldog wants me to.
Yes, he does.
He said you were the best.
Right?
That's what I said.
- Well, thank you, Bulldog.
- So you'll play?
- Well, I don't see how I can refuse.
- Great.
I can't wait to tell Daphne.
Yes, well, speaking of Daphne, while you're waiting for Daphne, why don't you go on out, get yourself a candy bar out of the machine.
Mother says candy rots tooth enamel.
Yes, well, chew on the side of your mouth.
Rot your baby teeth.
What do you think you're doing, telling him I'm a good softball player?
Trying to be nice.
You want me to tell him you're a big lame-o?
- No, I don't.
- Hey, look, I know how tough it is when you're a kid and you find out your dad's not as great as you thought.
Look, I was about Frederick's age when Well, I came home.
My mom was out and I caught my dad with another woman.
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm sorry.
- No, no.
No, wait.
You haven't heard the bad part yet.
She was ugly, doc.
I mean, coyote ugly.
My own dad.
And the best excuse he could come up with was: "Hey, you don't look at the mantel when you're poking the fire".
Hey!
I just got that.
I just keep thinking back to that time when Dad made us try Little League.
I'll never forget the humiliation of getting up to bat for the first time in my life, hearing the other team all cry out: "Move in, everybody.
Crane's up".
But they moved back out again after you took your first swing.
Only because the bat flew out of my hands.
You worry too much.
Your co-workers aren't expecting you to play brilliantly.
No, I can live with playing badly in front of my co-workers.
It's Frederick I'm worried about.
He's still at that age where he thinks his father can do anything.
Every child, at some point, must discover - that his father is not a superhero.
- I know.
It's a healthy part of the developmental process.
I know someday he's gonna have to learn that I'm not perfect.
It's just I was hoping it might be something less humiliating, like seeing me fast-dance at a family wedding.
- You consider that less humiliating?
- Well Hello.
Look who's here.
You two have fun while I was at work?
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.
We went to the amusement park.
We had a lovely time.
Only, I think the Ferris wheel scared him a bit.
He spent the whole ride hugging me for dear life.
Really.
Her hair smells like strawberry.
It smells like peach blossoms, lavender and vanilla.
From over here, at least.
Uncle Niles, are you coming to watch my dad play in the softball game?
- He's the best one on the team.
- Well, of course I am, Freddie.
I'll be there sitting right between you and Daphne.
Well, come on, Frederick.
Let's go get some hot chocolate.
Okay.
- So you see the problem.
- I certainly do.
No, that's your problem.
My problem is that I promised Frederick I would play on Saturday.
Guess I'm left with only one choice.
- You're gonna fake an injury?
- No, course not.
- I've got to learn how to play softball.
- In two days?
Well, back in college, when Stu Oberfeld got sick, I learned the role of Mercutio in a day and a half.
I was brilliant.
In the duelling scene, the audience was on the edge of their seats.
Yes, and they were under them when the sword flew out of your hands.
Gee, Dad, I wanna thank you for helping me out with this.
Don't mention it.
We're gonna whip you right into shape.
It must have been disappointing I never took any interest in this sort of thing as a kid.
Well, I understood.
Guess it's a little complex I must have developed when I was growing up.
The doorbell would ring, I'd run to answer it, and then there'd be the neighbourhood kids with their baseball gloves and their bats, looking for somebody else to join their game.
They'd say, "Hey, can your dad come out and play"?
Well, never mind that.
You know, it's kind of fun to finally be out here.
At the risk of sounding like Stanley cornering Blanche DuBois in Streetcar, we've had this date with each other from the very beginning.
I knew you'd ruin it.
All right, come on.
Put your helmet on.
Gee, it's kind of tight.
- Well, it's supposed to.
It stops you from getting hurt.
Okay?
Here, all right.
There you go.
Now take your bat, get into the stance, just like I told you.
I'm gonna turn the machine on.
The good thing about these balls is that they're all at the same level, so you can work on your form and your timing.
All right?
Okay, now, here we go.
Ah!
What is that?
A pitching machine or a particle accelerator?
All right, all right.
I'll crank it down to a lower setting.
Okay, now, just remember, left elbow in, right elbow up, knees bent.
All the weight on the balls of your feet, okay?
Now, just step into the pitch.
Oh, yeah, and swing the bat.
Dad, can't you just slow it down a little bit?
All right, but if any of the other fathers come back here, I'm taking it off the peewee setting.
Okay.
All right.
Now, from the hips.
Nice and easy.
Don't try to kill it.
Just try to make contact.
Okay, you ready?
Ready.
What are you looking at?
Dad, they're looking at me.
Get out of here.
Go on.
Buzz off!
Did you hear that?
Hear that?
I touched it that time.
I did.
No, it didn't.
That was my knee cracking.
You're doing a lot better, though.
Six in a row without hitting yourself in the kidney on your follow-through.
Who am I kidding?
This is hopeless.
Oh, well.
Well, why don't we just try changing bats.
I couldn't hit it if I had a sofa cushion.
All right, so softball's not your game.
It's no big deal.
Freddie will understand that.
I suppose in time he will.
It's just that Ow, ow, ow, ow.
No boy ever forgets the first time he learns that his dad isn't perfect.
It's not what I wanted him to take away with him on this trip.
- Anyway, thanks for your help.
- Oh, don't mention it.
So, Frasier what was it for you?
- Huh?
Well, you know, I mean, when you first found out that I was less than perfect.
I don't know.
Well, I thought you said a kid never forgets the first time.
- Maybe it was no one time.
- Oh, so it was a lot of times?
No.
I'm not very comfortable talking about it Well, why?
You're not gonna hurt my feelings.
I'm just curious.
All right, all right.
Back in third grade.
You took me and some of the boys from the math club out for pizza.
When the check came you couldn't figure out the tip in your head.
I can't do math in my head?
- That's your big disappointment?
- Well, it was at the time.
Well, I wonder if I can calculate in my head how many hits you got today.
Let me think.
Oh, zero!
Fine!
Fine, Dad, get defensive.
I was 8 years old.
Eight.
That's the one shaped like the snowman, right?
I'm sorry I even brought it up.
God.
Guess I'm gonna have to bite the bullet, sit Frederick down on Saturday before the game and tell him the truth.
Not a conversation I'm looking forward to, but I should prepare him for the fact his daddy's not gonna be hitting any grand slams on Saturday.
Or am I?
Wait.
- A grand slam is?
- You aren't.
Well, anyway, I suppose that one consolation is, you know, as disappointed as I was with you after the pizza incident, yet here we are, all these years later, out in a batting cage.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, I'll get us a couple of beers.
Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.
And how many of these shiny things?
Oh, shut up.
- Hello, Niles.
- You look like an authentic jock.
I'm half tempted to hand over my lunch money.
Is that your idea of appropriate baseball-watching attire?
Obviously you failed to detect the subtle diamond pattern in my tie.
Oh.
So how did your little talk go with Frederick?
Well, I haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet.
As a father, you go to any lengths to avoid looking foolish before your son.
Look what Mrs Thorgeson was throwing out.
Boy, the guys at McGinty's are gonna love this.
Well, anyhow What have I told you about running in the house?
You told me to never run in the house.
Good, and what about splitting infinitives?
Frasier, let the boy be a boy.
Don't run away.
I saw you.
Your son just walked right in on me in the shower.
- Frederick.
- Dad, all I really saw was I am very disappointed in you, young man.
Let the boy finish.
All I really saw was a lot of steam.
I'm sorry, Daphne.
I didn't know you were in the shower.
- Now you hate me.
- I don't hate you.
You just have to promise to knock before you enter a room, okay?
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay, son.
So when are we going to the game?
In a bit.
First we have to have a little conversation, the two of us.
Uncle Niles, could you give us a moment alone?
Oh, of course.
I'll freshen up for the game.
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.
I'm onto you, little man.
Come on, Freddie.
Come and have a seat here.
Okay.
You're gonna see me play some softball today.
And I'm not gonna play very well.
- See, I'm not a good softball player.
- But Bulldog said you were the best.
Yes, I know.
Well, he was just lying in order to be nice.
The truth is I stink.
I can't catch, I can't throw, I can't hit.
Oh.
So it must be pretty disappointing to hear for the first time - that your dad is not perfect, huh?
- It's not the first time.
You couldn't fix my computer.
You thought Venus was the North Star.
And I've seen you run.
Well, why didn't you mention any of these things to me before?
I thought it might hurt your self-esteem.
Actually, Frederick, I'm really okay with those things.
I am.
I want you to know that it's okay for you to feel bad about them.
See, when I was about your age, I felt real bad about learning that your grandpa can't do math in his head.
I learned later, of course, that that wasn't very important, because he can do so many other things so well.
- Grandpa can't do math in his head?
Yes, well, see - That's not the issue.
- Why did you go and tell him that for?
- Well, I was illustrating a point.
- You mean, you can't do it at all?
- Well, yeah, sure I can, Freddie.
- I knew you could.
What's seven times 15?
You can do it, Grandpa.
- 115?
Oh, Grandpa.
- Well, thanks a lot, Frasier.
- Well, I tried, for God's sake.
Ready for the game?
- Yeah.
You don't sound too excited.
I just found out Dad's bad at softball and Grandpa can't do math in his head.
Those things aren't important.
What can I do to make you feel better?
- Maybe a hug?
- Oh, come here.
Oh.
There you go.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Niles.
- I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, - but I need your help.
- Of course.
Sherry?
Please.
As you know, ever since I moved into The Montana, I've been angling to meet our most famous tenant, Esmë Bing, the walnut queen.
Well, I finally cornered her in the ornamental garden by the wishing well, and I felt very pleased with myself.
That is, until the walnut queen invited me to a ball.
Now I have a problem.
Yes, your life has become an operetta.
No, it's a charity ball.
And when I say "invited," I mean she let me buy a table for ten - at $5000.
- Oh, no.
I have until Sunday to sell eight $500 tickets.
- Say no more.
- Oh.
- It's a bit steep, but if it's for charity - Thanks, Frasier.
- It is a very worthy cause.
- All right.
- Well, who should I make this out to?
- To the Esmerelda Bing lnternational - Right.
Doll Museum.
You do have a problem.
I thought you prided yourself - on supporting the arts.
- The arts, Niles.
Not the crafts.
I told you, I can't do it now.
Sherry's taking me out for our third-month anniversary, and I gotta get a new sport coat.
You cannot skip your exercises again.
You skipped them yesterday.
This is the only time Sherry can go shopping with me.
And I can't go without her.
There isn't a woman alive with her fashion sense.
Carmen Miranda having passed on.
I should think having a lady friend would make you exercise more, not less.
I don't mean to be indelicate, but a man in your condition who wants to enjoy certain, shall we say, indoor sports should take steps to make sure that cranky old Mr Hip doesn't, shall we say, let down the team, if you get my meaning.
Oh, don't you worry about me.
I may not be rookie of the year anymore, but I can still move around the bases.
- Oh, hey, Martin.
- Oh, look, a scout from the majors.
- See you later.
Gotta run.
Okay, bye.
- Well, Roz, this is a surprise.
- Big news.
- Gertie Olsen's leaving the station.
- What, from Gertie's Grab Bag?
- I love that show.
Oh, please.
That homily-spouting hausfrau is the most embarrassing thing on the air.
- So she finally got canned, eh?
- No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.
Good news for Gertie, and for the many atheists who will welcome this new proof of their theory.
Well, anyway, they're auditioning people for her time slot, and I'm gonna go for it.
What do you mean, your own show?
Oh, Roz, that's exciting.
And what better way to celebrate an exciting new career move, than spending this Sunday at a swanky society ball.
Oh, drop it, Niles!
Roz, I must say, this comes as bit of a surprise.
I never knew you wanted your own show.
Well, it's the whole reason I got into radio.
I had my own show in college, and when I started working at the station, I just sort of got stuck on the producing side.
Well, what kind of show did you have in mind?
I thought I'd talk about stuff I know.
You know, the singles' life in Seattle.
Dating, fashion, where to meet available men.
If you're looking for an event that'll be crawling with single men, - this particular gala should be just - Niles!
Anyway, Frasier, I hope you'll support me on this.
Well I hate to lose you, but of course I'll support you.
Thank you, Frasier.
You're the best.
- Well - Well, listen, as long as I've got you all here, I'm putting together a tape, and I could use people to pretend to be callers.
We'd be glad.
- Sounds like fun.
- I'll come back tonight.
All right.
And, Daphne, I need at least one spicy call.
Could you pretend to be a woman who doesn't believe in sex without love, but just feels so horny sometimes she wants to jump anything in pants?
Well, I'll try.
And while I'm at it, I'll see if I can fake a British accent.
Good afternoon, Seattle.
I'm Roz Doyle, and this is Love Matters.
Today we're chatting with merchant seaman Steve Baron from Bellingham.
Tell me, Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date?
When my shipmates and I put into port after several weeks at sea Cut.
I'm sorry, Frasier, but you don't sound like a merchant seaman.
Point well taken.
Let's try again.
All right.
So, Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date?
When my shipmates and I put into port after several weeks at sea, the first thing we do is Head for the antique sales.
Fine, smarty pants.
You play Steve then.
No.
Never mind.
Let's just go on to my next idea.
Daphne?
Okay, you be the girlfriend in a couple who wants to spice things up in the bedroom.
- Niles, will you be her boyfriend?
- Yes.
Okay.
I'm here with Fred and Patty.
Tell me, you two, what made you think that your sex life needed a little jump-start?
It's all his fault.
He just seems to have lost interest in me.
I've done everything I can to entice him.
I've I've served dinner wearing nothing but high heels and an apron.
I've called him at the office and talked dirty.
And last night when he came home, I was lying in bed wearing a whipped-cream teddy.
But did he care?
No!
And none of this turned you on, Fred?
Fred?
That's nothing.
You should hear the other things that didn't turn me on.
Tell me about them, Patty.
Let's cut to the chase.
Patty, men are like fish.
When you first hook them, they wriggle around like crazy.
But once you finally reel them in, they just lie there with that glassy look.
- I'd throw this one back.
- That's terrible advice.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
You have no idea how Fred really feels about Daphne Patsy.
- Patty.
- Patty.
- This is pointless.
- No, Roz, you were doing just fine.
No, I was terrible.
I wasn't helpful.
I wasn't smart.
I wasn't even sassy.
Well, well, perhaps not sassy, but you were certainly saucy.
That borders on sassy.
Roz!
Hello, Mr Crane.
How was your romantic evening with Sherry?
Oh, it was fine.
Fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Daph, how about getting that exercise mat out?
We'll do some stretches, huh?
Ah.
Can't right now.
I'm helping Roz with her audition tape.
Well, how long's it gonna take?
What are you so eager for?
Oh, I get the picture.
Not too limber with Sherry this evening, were we?
Two hips but no hooray?
Very funny.
Well, you haven't exactly been burning it up in the romance department either.
What do you know about my love life?
DAPHNE : I was lying in bed wearing a whipped-cream teddy.
But did he care?
It takes a little time to get the hang of it at first.
My God, you should've heard my audition tape.
- I was so inept it was incredible.
- That's true.
Well Oh, you mean Well, you heard it.
All right, then you see what perseverance There was a bootleg copy floating around the station for months.
Yes, well, fine.
So you get my point then.
- Yeah, people still play it at parties.
- Well, all right, Roz!
Hey, Roz, I hear you're trying out for a new job.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
And you could really help me with my demo.
- What do I do?
- I just want an honest answer.
- I want to talk to you about first dates.
- Okay.
Are you sure Dad's the best candidate for this particular subject?
Quick survey.
How many Crane men here with a girlfriend?
No, no.
Keep them up while I count.
All right, here.
- Sure, I'll help you.
Great.
- Okay, Frasier  Just a minute.
Here we are.
Start the tape.
Yes.
We're here with Martin, and we're talking about first dates.
Martin, tell me some of the tricks you use to impress women.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz, but I really don't know any tricks.
I mean, if a woman agrees to go out with me, I'd Well, I'm not there to impress her or to play cool.
I'm there because I want to know her.
You know, what she thinks, what she likes.
So that if I'm lucky enough to get another date, I can plan something that I know she'd like to do.
I guess I'm still old-fashioned or something, but I think you should treat a woman like a queen.
Bow to the master, boys.
Bow to the master.
- Hey, Bebe!
- Bulldog Briscoe, my absolute favourite client!
Hello, Bebe.
And Frasier Crane!
Alert the judges, we have a tie!
Hello.
Oh, my goodness, what a flock.
These all yours?
Yes.
The minute I heard about the auditions, I piled all my hottest new discoveries into the van.
- You brought them in a van?
- I call it my Bebe's Stars of Tomorrow Tour.
People, I want you to meet Frasier Crane.
Hello.
- The caringest client - an agent ever had.
- Well Frasier, this is Professor Pete, the human encyclopaedia.
Ask him anything.
He can't be stumped.
Well, all right.
Explain Freud's theory of the superego.
Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist, was born in Vienna.
- But that's not what I asked.
- He believed dreams had secret meanings.
He just pulls it out of the air.
But if it's a raucous political debate you want, meet newlyweds Hank and Hannah Finch.
- Hello, Hank.
- He's a right-wing Baptist preacher, she's a fun-loving bisexual.
Conflicts?
You bet!
- Have you ever seen such talent?
- Well God, they're pathetic.
- Frasier, Frasier!
Roz.
- It went really well.
- Oh, God, I'm so happy for you.
Do you know what he actually said?
At this moment, - I am the candidate to beat!
- Congratulations, Roz.
- That's fabulous.
Okay.
- I'm gonna get set up for the show.
- Okay.
- I'm so excited.
- Okay.
Well, rah-rah for little Roz!
Yes, well, I'm really thrilled for her.
I am.
But God knows where I'm gonna find another producer I feel so in sync with.
You know, Hank Finch produced hygiene films in the Army.
No, no.
Bebe, I don't think so.
Oh, I'm not proud to admit this, but there is a small part of me that hopes she doesn't get the job.
God, I feel guilty just saying that.
You're so good.
Everything makes you feel guilty.
I'm so proud to represent you.
You're like a modern-day what's-his-name.
Pete!
Famous German doctor, built a hospital in Africa.
- Albert something?
- Hang on.
- Schweitzer.
- No And that's it for our show today.
But before I sign off, this final note to Karla, who called us early from the planet Fripton.
The technical term for your condition, which eluded me earlier, is schizophreniform disorder.
Or in layman's terms: God, you know once in a while, it's nice to just call them as I see them.
Hey, what's going on out here?
Oh, good Lord, is it someone's birthday?
I hate to be the one to break it to you, but Brenda from the newsroom got the job.
- Brenda?
- Oh, Roz.
It's total BS.
Listen, if you need a little comforting later Hey, Brenda, all right!
Wait up!
I'm there for you.
- Roz, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, hell.
I'll be okay.
Guess I'd better go congratulate the winner.
Right.
Bebe, did you hear what happened to Roz?
- Yes.
No need to thank me, darling.
- What?
What are you talking about?
I spoke to the station manager.
I told him just how you'd feel if he gave Roz the job.
You did what?
Get in here!
I said that Frasier Crane wasn't about to work for a station - that would steal his producer away.
- Oh.
A bluff, of course, but he crumbled like a matzo.
God, how could you?
When I told you I'd hate to lose Roz, I didn't mean for you - to sabotage her.
- You didn't?
Oh, no.
What a horrible misunderstanding.
Wink!
I mean it.
Oh, I see.
So when you said in that off-handed way that you hoped that Roz wouldn't get the job, I totally misinterpreted you.
- Wink!
- Will you stop winking!
My God, I could never want such a thing!
God, maybe there's some way I can still reverse this.
Oh, that was fun.
I got to watch Brenda sign her new contract.
Roz, I think what they did to you is monstrous.
I wish I could stay here and console you, but my people are waiting for me in the van.
I hope someone cracked a window.
Listen, Roz, there's something we need to talk about.
Oh, Frasier, I know what you're gonna say.
That I tried my best.
That I deserved it.
I'm fine with this, really.
Yeah, I gave it a shot.
That's what counts.
I didn't get it.
It's not like my life is over.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh, look at me.
I'm so busy feeling sorry for myself I haven't even thanked you for all your help.
- That's not necessary.
- No, it is.
Look how close you helped me get.
It's because of you that I was second choice.
I can't argue with that.
Come for a second.
Listen, there's something I need to confess to you.
You know, as much as I hoped that you'd get the job, there was a very small part of me, a very selfish part, that That hoped you wouldn't.
Oh, that's not bad.
That's really kind of sweet.
Well, I'm glad to hear you feel that way because I happened to mention those feelings to Bebe.
- Bebe?
You told Bebe?
- It was just in passing.
Oh, great.
She torpedoed me, didn't she?
Yes.
She told Doug that I'd quit if you got the job.
- I don't believe this.
- I'm glad to see you're as mad - at her as I am!
- I'm mad at you!
- Me?
- How could do that?
It was just an off-hand remark.
How was I to know how she'd react?
She's Bebe!
If you had said you liked my eyes, they would've been on your desk tomorrow in a Tiffany box.
Oh, God!
Roz, I'm so sorry.
Just tell me how I can make it up to you.
I promise I will.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
Anything.
Just name it.
- Fire Bebe.
- Will that?
Well How many things?
Isn't there something else you'd like?
The only thing I wanted was that job.
And she took it away.
I am not just suggesting this for my sake.
I'm suggesting it for yours.
She is your representative.
When she goes out into the world lying and twisting your words and stabbing people in the back, it reflects badly on you.
You're right, Roz.
How can I consider myself an ethical person when I have the princess of darkness conducting my business for me?
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna have to fire that conniving harpy.
I'm very proud of you.
I'm ashamed to think how long I've turned a blind eye on her unscrupulous behaviour.
And what for?
Twenty-percent pay increase?
Six-week paid vacation.
An expense account.
A travel allowance.
- Frasier!
- Well, not anymore.
Frasier Crane's here.
He's not alone.
Have a seat.
Frasier, Roz.
My two favourite people.
- Not for long.
- Bebe, we've got to discuss what happened this morning.
This time you won't wink your way out of it.
This sounds serious.
You two come right in, and we'll solve this thing.
Let's just promise to be totally honest with each other.
We're losing one.
Code red.
What can I get you?
Champagne?
Nothing.
- A massage?
- No, thank you.
You're sure?
Vladimir can be here in five minutes.
He will play your spine like a Steinway.
Can we just get started?
Roz, I'm just a wreck about our misunderstanding today.
- Can you ever forgive me?
- No.
Why should you?
I don't forgive myself.
Bebe, what you did today was unfair, not just to Roz, but to me.
Thanks to you, a strain has been put on our relationship, both professionally and personally.
Now all of this I might be able to let go had it been an isolated incident, but I've observed that it's just part of a pattern Are you quite all right?
It's nothing.
It's just a silly little cardiac thing.
Go, go!
You're distracting my client, and my clients come first.
Oh, poor little Bebe.
How many fake pills do you have to take every day?
Yes, did you really think you could deceive us sitting there popping a bunch of Digitalis?
Oh, my God!
You really are sick!
Well, of course I'm sick.
But it makes me even sicker to think that I've angered you when all I wanted to do was keep the best damn team in radio together.
Oh, God.
We're gonna need a shovel to get out of here.
Yes, all right, Bebe.
Be that as it may, I still  I told you, no calls.
What about my sister?
One second.
Did the air bag deploy?
Look, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Frasier's here, and my clients come first.
I'm sorry.
You were saying?
Since the moment we met, you have shown yourself to be ruthless and untrustworthy.
As these are qualities I do not wish to have associated with my name, It's best that we part  - What did I say about calls?
LITTLE  Auntie Bebe?
Oh, Suzy.
Sorry to hear about your mummy's accident.
I'm frightened, Auntie Bebe.
Don't be, little one.
If Mummy goes to heaven, will you take care of me?
Of course, my little lamb.
Assuming that I have the resources.
Bebe, you know, I can't help noticing that none of your outside lines are lit up.
The bulbs are broken.
Auntie has to go.
I'm with a client, and you know what we say about clients.
They always come first.
- You are amazing.
- Is there nothing you won't stoop to?
I had no idea who I was speaking to!
How dare you impersonate my niece!
I've had enough of your cruel jokes!
You're fired, Mother!
- I just wanna say - No!
Stop!
Not one more crooked word!
Your tongue could open a wine bottle!
As of now, Frasier Crane has resigned from your coven.
Oh, that's it, is it?
I'm not virtuous enough for you?
Not noble?
Fine, quit!
Next time you need a deal made, call the Dalai Lama!
A long time ago I had to make a choice between being a good agent and a good person, because, trust me, you can't be both!
So forgive me if I don't have time to make everybody feel warm and fuzzy.
I am just too busy spending every waking minute pulling any string, playing any shameless trick I can to make my clients' dreams come true.
I am a star maker!
And if you can't appreciate that, there are plenty who can.
How about you?
You want an agent?
- Oh, please!
- You mean it?
Roz!
I never had an agent.
It's not like she worships the devil.
Well, she doesn't have to.
He worships her!
You're absolutely right, Frasier.
Forget it, Bebe.
No way.
That voice.
I could listen to it all day.
It's pure, yet smouldering like a nun with a past.
- You think so?
- No, Roz, don't look her in the eye.
I could triple your salary.
Voiceovers, commercials Roz, listen to me.
For God's sake, if you've got the tiniest shred of sense or dignity left, remember what this woman did to you this afternoon.
And renounce her.
She has no scruples.
No ethics.
And no reflection!
Let's get out of here.
Well, nice doing business with you.
Wink!
Oh, damn it.
Frasier, I forgot my purse.
- All right.
Just be a minute.
- Lunch tomorrow?
- 12:30.
Bernardi's.
Gotcha.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Let me have a tall skinny to go, please, and you can keep the change.
Now, I've only got a moment.
I've taken on a very exciting project.
- Oh, really.
Yes.
You know, this is KACL's 50th anniversary.
I did a little research, found out that they used to specialize in live radio dramas.
So I'm putting one on.
- Surely you must remember them.
- Oh, sure.
Yes, people of Dad's generation would sit around at night, listening to the radio, absolutely mesmerized.
We were a simple people.
All right, Dad.
I spoke with the station manager.
He's given me 30 minutes to re-create the very first mystery KACL ever aired.
- "Nightmare Inn".
- Oh, don't tell me, I know.
Bunch of people get caught in a storm, and everybody's wondering who's gonna be the first one murdered.
- Exactly!
And I'm going to direct.
- Oh, so we can stop wondering.
You don't think he knows how to direct?
No, the trouble is he doesn't know how to stop directing.
In our prep school production of Richard III, he drove the entire cast crazy with his constant critiquing.
I seem to recall a delay on opening night while our Richard chased Frasier around the dressing room, beating him with his hump.
Niles, it was just a little backstage horseplay to relieve tension.
- Thank you.
- You have an Orson Welles complex.
In the end, you'll be directing, you'll have rewritten the script and be playing the lead.
I have no intention of performing in it myself.
The only rewriting I've done is simply cutting, to get it down to 30 minutes.
- "Frasier Crane's Nightmare Inn"?
- It's just a working title.
Well, that's our show for today, but let me remind you to tune in on Saturday night for KACL's presentation of "Nightmare Inn".
Just set your dials for goose bumps.
Till then, this is Dr Frasier Crane reminding you that you'll never know what's lurking in the shadows.
Well, that should certainly comfort the woman who called in about her paranoia.
- Do we have a leading man yet?
- No.
- Well, you could do it.
- Oh, don't be silly, Roz.
My God, it is a juicy part, does call for a strong voice, - but believe me, my hands are full.
- Oh, Frasier, I've had a quick peek at your script, and I think I'd be perfect as "Bull" Kragen, the brutish gamekeeper.
You know, Gil, I think that's just a bit too on the nose.
- Well, maybe.
- But you know what you could play?
Yes.
Nigel Fairservice.
Drummed out of the Royal Air Force under mysterious circumstances.
With him playing it, they may not seem so mysterious.
I'll take it.
After all, Nigel does have that divine speech in the second act about his boyhood in Surrey: "Romping with his school chums in the fens and spinneys, when the twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent flame".
Actually, I had rather a long peek at the script.
Gosh, we still have a lot of these supporting roles to cast.
Actually, I'm working on that.
Jennifer down in Accounting is married to a professional actor who specializes in dialects.
I'm thinking of asking him to play six or seven smaller parts.
Hey, doc.
Need one more for your play?
Absolutely, Bulldog.
Just as long as you promise - to promote it on your show.
- Actually, I wasn't talking about me.
I was talking about a friend of mine, Maxine.
- Does she have experience?
Are you kidding?
If she had a dollar for every minute she spent on stage Oh, wait a minute.
She does.
Well, we do still have the part of the maid.
She only has one line.
- Does it have any big words?
- No, it's simple.
"Look out!
He's got a gun".
Maxine could knock that line right out of the park.
Well, okay, but you have to agree to play a part too.
We still need someone for the sinister silk merchant.
Okay, it's a deal.
And Maxine is gonna be so excited.
I gotta remember to pick her up one of those cute French maid outfits - on my way home from work.
- It's radio.
- She doesn't have to be in costume.
- Maybe here she doesn't.
- Well, we're getting there.
- Except for the lead.
I haven't found anyone remotely qualified to play a wily old Scotland Yard inspector.
You may be right.
I may have to bite the bullet.
- Take on the part myself.
Excuse me, Dr Crane.
Is it too late to read for the role of the inspector?
I'm afraid the part has already been cast.
Come on in.
- Hi, Daphne.
Hello.
Bulldog, Gil.
Right on time, good.
We have to be on our toes tonight, we have a professional actor with us.
Mel White, - our man of a thousand voices.
- Oh, it's a huge pleasure.
Mel is going to play Hans, the German butler, both McCallister sisters, and Peppo the dwarf, "a little man with a big secret".
The same guy's playing all those parts?
Yes, he's also playing "Bull" Kragen, the gamekeeper, and O'Toole, the handyman.
Are you up to it?
Just so they don't all talk at once.
Isn't it lovely to be working with a professional?
- Hold it.
Bulldog, where's Maxine?
- She's home with food poisoning.
It's nothing serious.
I think she just wrestled in some bad Jell-O.
Well, never mind.
She just has one line, anyway.
"Look out!
He's got a gun".
You think you You might be up to that this evening, Daphne?
- Oh, I'll try.
Good.
Frasier, one of Nigel's lines seems to be missing.
Yes, I had to cut the play by 20 minutes, Gil.
Yes, yes.
But that line so neatly defined Nigel's character.
Saying "gesundheit" after the butler sneezes?
It shows he's a caring person.
- It's cut, Gil.
Learn to let go.
- Oh, very well.
As long as I still have that delicious speech about my boyhood in Surrey.
- Yes, that's still in.
- "Romping with my school chums - in fens and spinneys" - Yes, yes, that one!
Yes, thank you.
All right, now, I fear we may be running just a bit long still.
So I've asked Daphne to time us this evening, and also, Noel hasn't rounded up all the sound effects yet, so I'm gonna have Daphne read those directions as well.
Now, that's a lot of responsibility on you, are you sure you're up to it?
All right.
Start the watch.
Stage direction.
- "Sound of door opening".
- Inspector, thank God you've come.
Stop the watch.
Roz, I have a line here that says, "When she opened her lips, I caught a hint of some exotic accent".
You'll notice it does not say, "When she opened her lips, cheese fell out".
Okay, and start the watch.
This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndyke.
"Sound of door closing".
I can't believe any of my guests could be a multiple murderer.
That's easy for you to say, but my job is to suspect everyone.
Please introduce me to your guests.
This is the silk merchant, Mr Wang.
Stop the watch.
- What's your problem?
- "Wang"?
You gotta give me another name.
I'll crack up every time I hear that.
All right.
All right.
How about "Wing"?
All right?
That's a great old Chinese name.
All right, everybody, change Wang to Wing in your scripts.
Sound of people changing Wangs to Wings.
From your line.
Start.
This is the silk merchant, Mr Wing.
Did you see anything suspicious, Wing?
Oh, me no lookee.
Me go beddy-bye, chop-chop.
Stop!
Chinese Embassy on line one.
- You can't say that.
It's all right.
I'll just adjust his dialogue later.
All right.
Start.
I'm Nigel Fairservice, inspector.
I was strolling in the garden - when this dreadful tragedy occurred.
- Did anyone see you?
Several people.
Hans, the German butler  Ja, I saw him.
Stop.
You know, that's wonderful, Mel but he sounds to me just a bit more Austrian than German.
I've done that accent both on Broadway and the London stage.
Yes, well, perhaps they have different standards than I have.
All right, everyone.
From the beginning once again.
Now, this time, please, people, dig in, and try to find the reality.
From the dwarf's entrance.
And so the case was closed.
And with a grateful shudder, I swore I'd never return to Nightmare Inn.
Stop.
Time?
- That's 32 minutes, 40 seconds.
- Damn!
I'll trim some more before we try again.
- Again?
We did this four times!
- We'll do it till I'm completely satisfied.
Oh, which reminds me, Mel I'm still not entirely happy with the second McCallister sister.
Oh?
Well, she doesn't sound spinsterish enough to me.
I see.
You also told me that my gamekeeper sounded too cultured, that my Irishman sounded more Protestant than Catholic, and that my dwarf was too tall!
Let me try Hans again and tell me how my German is sounding.
I quit!
- Well, oh, wait!
You can't Sound of door slamming.
- So, what do we do now, boss?
- Not to worry.
I have a plan.
Oh, yeah, right.
We're supposed to do this thing tomorrow night.
Where are you gonna find an idiot willing to take six dialect parts unrehearsed?
Niles.
The sound of ominous organ music indicating trouble ahead.
Oh, there's your brother.
How is he enjoying the prospect of playing six parts?
Actually, he doesn't know about it yet.
If he did, he never would have agreed.
Frasier.
You were going to messenger the script to me - this morning.
- I'm so, so sorry, I was tinkering with it until the last minute.
But not to worry, your natural talent will carry you through.
All right, look, take a look at this.
Noel will give us a demonstration of the sound effects.
What have you got?
Okay.
This is my door sound, my thunder screen, balloons for gunshots, and this plays various kinds of organ music.
- Oh, yes.
- That's great.
I've also got a gravel box, bells, a rain stick and coffee thermos.
- What does that do?
- Keeps my coffee warm.
- Everybody, this is Maxine.
- Oh, hello, Maxine.
Welcome.
Hi.
I need a quiet place to work on my part.
Oh, you got it, baby.
Why don't you go up here in the booth.
Bulldog?
Work on her part?
It's just one line.
Yeah, but she's got that condition, what do you call it?
It begins with a "dis".
Dis, dis?
Distemper?
Dyslexia.
That's it, she's dyslexic.
- And you tell me that now.
- No, no.
Hey, she'll be great.
It's me I'm worried about.
I've got some serious butterflies going here.
But you're on radio all the time.
Yeah, but that's me being me.
This is acting.
It's It's scary.
Listen, that's all a part of the thrill of the live performance, butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, scratchy throat, pounding heart.
- I suppose you have all of those.
- I do now.
Sorry I'm late, Frasier.
I just spent two hours in the dentist's chair.
- An emergency.
- What is the matter?
Novocaine.
He said it would wear off by now.
Oh, I keep biting my lip.
Dear God.
We've got 60 seconds.
Well, I don't even know who I'm playing.
Don't worry, I'll cue you as we go along.
- Shouldn't I prepare a little?
- Now, listen, your natural spontaneity is your best asset as an actor.
What was it the Yale Daily News said about your Tartuffe?
Oh, who remembers?
That I had the magnetism of Marlon Brando, the charm of Danny Kaye and the range of Laurence Olivier.
All right, everyone.
Places, please.
- Hurry up, it's starting!
- All right.
Good evening.
This is Frasier Crane welcoming you to KACL's re-creation of the original Mystery Theatre.
I already know the plot, but I'll try not to blurt out the name of the murderer.
Great.
As a cop, I hated it when people did that.
In all my years at the Yard, I doubt I'd ever seen a fouler night than that on which I was called out to investigate a double murder at the old inn on the moors.
The door was answered by Miss Carlotta Thorndyke.
Her face was unfamiliar, and when she opened her lips, I caught a hint of some exotic accent.
Inspector Ow.
Thank God you've come.
This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndyke.
I can't believe any of my guests could be a multiple murderer.
That's easy for you to say.
But my job is to suspect everybody.
Please introduce me to your No, no.
Never mind.
I know your guests by reputation.
This must be Mr Wing, the silk merchant.
Did you witness anything suspicious, Wing?
Of course, the inscrutable and mute Mr Wing who wears a bell on his hat.
Did you witness anything suspicious, Wing?
No, eh?
I'll remember you said that.
I'm Nigel Fairservice, inspector.
I was strolling in the garden when this dreadful tragedy occurred.
- Did anyone see you?
- Several people.
Hans, the German butler.
Ja, I saw the gentleman.
O'Toole, the gardener.
Aye, 'twas himself and no mistake.
As well as Prudence McCallister.
Yes, I was taking a breath of air.
I tried to shake Nigel's alibi, but each witness was adamant.
- O'Toole: - Faith, and it's true.
- Hans: - Jawohl.
- Miss McCallister: - Oh, mercy, yes.
There remained one suspect whose whereabouts had not yet been established.
Peppo the dwarf, a retired circus performer.
Exactly where were you when the murders occurred, Peppo?
Peppo!
Where were you?
I was at the movies.
At the movies, you say?
Well, one quick phone call can verify that.
What's this?
Dear God!
The phone lines have been cut.
Now we're really stranded.
Totally and completely isolated from any contact with the outside world.
Studio Five.
Sorry.
The phone lines have been repaired, you say?
Hello?
Wait!
They've gone dead again.
Who knows what other surprises this night may bring.
I don't remember the plots of these things being so goofy.
Mr Wing wasn't mute last night.
Six different roles in six different accents?
I've half a mind to walk out.
Yes, I'm sorry, Niles, but you're doing brilliantly.
Except your Your Hans could be a bit gruffer.
- Don't direct me.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Right now, frankly, I'm just a bit more worried - about being over time.
Gil!
Yes?
At the bottom of page 14, listen, after you're shot, just say, "I'm dying".
Cut the rest.
- That's my boyhood-in-Surrey speech.
- Yes, I know.
- You can't cut that, you can't.
- Stop whining.
We have a play to do.
I don't care anymore.
All right.
Please, quiet, everybody.
Ten seconds.
Oh, Maxine, be sure to watch out for your cue, and please, people, let's pick up the pace!
"Nightmare Inn".
Act Two.
I was baffled.
They all had alibis.
Suddenly Miss Thorndyke pointed, her eyes wide with alarm.
There's someone outside the window!
Why, yes, Miss Thorndyke.
It appears to be  the ice cream truck.
But never mind that.
Suddenly the storm put the lights out.
And we were left in darkness.
Then, a scream.
Ah!
Look out!
He's got a nug!
A gun!
A gun is what he's got!
When the lights came back up, a smoking gun lay on the table.
The maid lay dead, unable to name her killer, and Nigel Fairservice lay mortally wounded.
I'm dying.
Poor man was gone.
Never again to revisit the scene of my boyhood in Surrey.
Romping with my school chums in the fens and spinneys Just then, the lights went out again!
Nigel Fairservice was shot again.
Only grazed me.
When the twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent The final bullet blew his head clean off his shoulders.
All right, people, let's try to keep calm.
Although it's hard when the killer is among us.
Heigh-ho, I'm Nigel's brother, Cedric.
I haven't seen him since our boyhood.
We'd romp And so died the last surviving member of the Fairservice family.
Boy, I sure didn't see that one coming.
Hello, I'm the ice cream man.
Years ago I went to school with Nigel Fairservice.
We used to romp in the fens and spinneys  This is turning into a bloodbath.
See, that's why I prefer TV.
You want to be able to see that stuff.
By this time, I was more baffled than ever, so I played a hunch.
Hans, may I see your fingernails?
- Why?
- They seem a bit ragged - for a butler.
- All right, all right, I'm not what I appear.
None of us is.
I'm not a butler.
I'm not even German.
Sit down, inspector.
You're about to hear a fascinating tale.
Each of us holds a piece of the puzzle to relate to you.
When we've finished, you'll know the full, dark secret of Nightmare Inn.
Are you sure we should, Hans?
Be quiet, Mother.
Mother and I moved here when I was a small boy after the tragic death of my father.
I kept the pain of that loss buried deep within me like a serpent coiled within a damp cave.
Okay, that's it.
Never mind all that.
I'm just going to take this gun off the table.
Sorry about that, O'Toole.
I guess we'll never hear your fascinating piece of the puzzle.
Or yours, Kragen and Peppo.
Could the McCallister sisters stand back-to-back?
I'm short on bullets.
Thank you.
- What was your name?
- Miss Thorndyke.
Thank you.
And also Mr Wing.
And, of course, one final bullet for myself, so the mystery will die with me.
Ha.
Well, then that pretty much wrapped things up.
Hans was a mass murderer, to the surprise of everyone.
Case was closed.
And with a grateful shudder, I swore I'd never return to Nightmare Inn.
Well, we still have nine minutes remaining.
Perhaps we could have a little post-play discussion.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Have you noticed there are fewer hazelnuts in these biscotti?
Then I'm not crazy.
And yet they've gone up 25 cents.
Fewer nuts, more money.
Something I've been aspiring to my entire professional life.
God, that is the last time I jog in these shorts.
My thighs are chafing like a couple of hams wrapped in Velcro.
Non-fat mocha, please.
What?
As flattered as we are that you've chosen our company over, oh, say, a shower perhaps you'd like to go to the ladies' room to freshen up a bit?
Hey, at least I try to keep in shape.
I haven't seen either one of you run an eight-minute mile.
Stand upwind of us and you might.
Oh, by the way, Niles, my benefit for the Seattle Theatre Ensemble is tonight.
I haven't received your check yet.
That's because I'm still not sure if I'm coming.
Whom should I expect to meet there?
Professional people around our age.
- A certain social standing.
- Yes.
Civic-minded, interested in the arts Oh, for God's sake, how many women?
Why didn't you just say so?
Well, I thought my rutting-monkey body language would have tipped you off.
Well, judging from my RSVP list, there should be quite a few available women.
Well, in that case, I'll be there.
Here's my money.
Better be worth my while.
Oh, look, here comes Sherry and Dad.
- Duck.
- No, no, it's all right.
- I invited them.
- Sherry's not going to be there at your benefit is she?
I can stop that check.
Just relax, Niles.
I've come up with rather an ingenious plan to occupy their evening tonight.
I bought them tickets to an event that's right up their alley.
God, I was so mortified buying the tickets, I paid cash so they couldn't trace it back to me.
- Sherry, Dad.
Hi.
Excuse me, people.
Did somebody leave some tickets here?
- Oh, Lord.
Yes!
- Something called "Nashville on Ice, - Yes, right here.
- The All-Skating Country Jamboree"?
Yeah, well.
Well, don't look so smug.
You try skating and blowing into a jug when your heart's breaking.
I can't believe you scored tickets to that.
You are well-connected in this town.
Well, yes, actually, these are a gift for you and Dad.
- Oh, my God.
- I hope you're free this evening.
Well, we are now.
Wow, Frasier, thanks!
Look at this.
Rink side!
Niles, what's that on your cheek?
Oh, what?
My lips.
Oh, look at the time.
I have to go.
Oh, it seems like every time I see you, you're just leaving.
Yes, and I'd love to stay, but I have my therapy group meeting, and last time I was late, the compulsive gamblers were betting the passive-aggressives that they couldn't make the overeaters cry.
If you wanna wait here, I'll get us a couple of coffees.
You know how I like it.
Hot and sweet!
Yeah, but how do you like your coffee?
- Is he always that funny?
- Oh, yes.
Oh.
It's that damn soap dispenser.
I just gave it a good pump, and splat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Roz Doyle, my producer.
You haven't met Dad's inamorata Sherry Dempsey.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
I normally look a lot better than this.
Oh, now, you don't have to be self-conscious around me, hon.
We all have our bad days once we pass 40.
It was nice seeing you.
- What did she say?
- Oh, who cares?
It's the least I can do to string together a few moments of silence without her underfoot.
My God, the woman's practically moved in with me.
What did she say?
Oh, Roz, take heart.
Now come on, listen, you may not look your best today, but you know what?
There's a man sitting right over there who can't keep his eyes off of you.
- Oh, where?
- Right there.
Oh, my God.
That's John Coughlin from my high school.
Oh, dear God, please don't let him recognize me.
I swear I'll never leave the house unbeautiful again.
- Roz?
- Thanks for listening.
Roz Doyle?
It's me.
John Coughlin.
Hi, John.
- Look at you.
- Look at you.
I hardly recognized you with that moustache.
- Roz - Oh, Frasier, I'm so sorry.
This is John Coughlin, Frasier Crane.
- Hello.
- So did you just move to Seattle?
No, I've been here for a week on business.
Now it's back to Racine.
Remember Marcie?
- Yeah.
- She's getting married Saturday.
- No kidding.
- Well, I'm late for a meeting, but it was great running into you.
I can't wait to tell - the whole gang I saw you.
- You don't have to do that.
Frasier, that guy was the biggest gossip in my hometown.
He saw me with my hair all sweaty and my sweatshirt full of soap.
Oh, God, what could be worse?
Well, here's a hint.
Got milk?
Oh, my God.
As a rule I'm terribly nervous hosting these things, but it seems to be going well, doesn't it?
Not for me.
I haven't made inroads with a single woman here.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What are you doing?
You look nauseated.
That woman is flirting with me.
This is my "I'm available" face.
Well, stop it.
My God, people will think the shrimp are bad.
- All right, which one?
- At 9 o'clock blond hair, blue dress.
Now 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.
- Oh, mama, high noon.
- Oh, dear.
I'm sorry, I have to leave early.
I wanted to let you know what a lovely time I've had.
Well, thank you, Adair.
It was good to see you.
Adair Peck, my brother, Dr Niles Crane.
- Enchanted.
- Hi.
Are you feeling okay?
Bad shrimp.
I so enjoyed our chat about Brecht.
I'm just sorry we didn't get to finish it.
Well, me too.
I never do this, but if you'd like to give me a call sometime, I'd like that.
You don't have to call me.
Only if you want to.
And we can talk about other non-Brecht things.
- Of course.
- You see why I never do this.
Well, I'm certainly glad that you did it with me.
Nice meeting you, Miles.
Dr Crane.
Who's that gentleman over there?
That's Matthew Pinnick, one of the theatre's biggest benefactors.
Well, I just caught him back in my bedroom.
Well, I'm sure he just wandered in there by mistake.
He was trying on my shoes.
An interesting piece of information.
Something tells me the theatre's going to get that new sound system.
Excuse me.
On behalf of the Seattle Theatre Ensemble, I would like to thank Dr Frasier Crane for hosting tonight's benefit.
But before we say good night, let's try and coax him into saying a few words.
All right.
Alexander Pope once wrote that the theatre aspires to wake the soul by tender strokes of art.
To raise the genius, and to mend the heart.
I'd like to say that it's my privilege to help ensure the survival of this noble calling.
And, well, thank you all for coming.
And I'll see you opening night of Run For Your Wife.
Wow, that was terrific.
Are you always this eloquent?
Oh, well, hardly.
My muse, alas, is somewhat ephemeral.
Well, it sounds pretty reliable to me.
- Leslie Wellman.
We met earlier.
- Leslie.
Of course, yes.
Well, I have to run, but I hope I'm not being too forward.
I'd love it if you'd give me a call sometime.
I'd be delighted to.
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.
Was that Natalie Spencer I just saw you talking with?
As a matter of fact, it was.
I've been admiring her all evening, so I steeled myself and asked her - if she might be free next week.
- And?
Well, her lips said, "No".
But her eyes said, "Read my lips".
I suppose you've come over here to gloat - because a woman came on to you.
- Oh, no, hardly.
I wouldn't do that sort of thing.
I came over to gloat because two women came on to me.
Two?
My God, I've never had a night like this in my entire life.
I'm a babe magnet.
I'm catnip.
I think I feel a fur ball coming up.
Tell me your second conquest wasn't that haughty filly - in the white dress, Kimberly Egan?
- No, no, your path is clear.
Oh, what's the point?
I can't take another rejection.
Well, Niles, tell you what.
Seeing as how Cupid has so amply stocked my quiver this evening, I will try a shot on your behalf.
Oh, God, you're unbearable.
Excuse me.
Kimberly, good evening.
Oh, Frasier, thank you again for tonight.
- You really are a wonderful host.
- Oh, thank you.
Listen, I don't usually do this sort of thing, but there's a gentleman here tonight who's, well, rather taken with you.
He's a An eligible doctor, and he's a bit shy about coming over and expressing those interests to you.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Well, you tell your bashful friend he needn't be so coy.
I'd love to go out with you sometime, Frasier.
Call me tomorrow.
- Oh, do you know my brother?
- Oh, of course I do.
Nice seeing you again, Miles.
Anyway, Dr Crane, I've spent months now sending out resumes, pounding the pavement, but nothing.
Well, Doug, it's possible you're simply going through a dry spell.
You know, it happens to all of us.
Months go by with nothing.
Then completely out of the blue, you get not one, but three offers without doing anything.
Not just for any jobs either, but desirable ones with ample salaries and fabulous perks.
Be patient.
Finding employment is much like dating.
Opportunities come along when you least expect them.
Thanks, Dr Crane.
Actually, dating's the one area I don't have any problems in.
Right now, I've got two women interested in me.
Two?
Well, that must make you the envy of most men.
Well, that's all for today, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.
All right, you've compared dating to unemployment, claustrophobia and bed-wetting.
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?
Ask me if I'm free this weekend.
- Well, obviously - Roz, ask me.
Come on.
And let me remind you it is a three-day weekend.
- Are you free this weekend?
- No, I'm not.
I have a date.
I have a date tomorrow night.
Oh, and let me check my calendar for Sunday.
Oh, yes.
Another date.
- Not bad.
- Not bad?
If I didn't know better, I'd say someone was jealous.
After this weekend, you may have to give up your dating crown.
I once had three dates on a single Saturday and still had time to defrost my refrigerator and rotate my tires.
It's a wonder you could rotate anything after that.
- All right, I concede.
- All right, good.
- Will you help me with something?
- Sure.
Do you think it's weird to send a wedding present to someone you haven't seen or spoken to in 18 years?
It's a bit unusual, but sweet nonetheless.
Okay.
What if the wedding gift happens to be a sterling-silver picture frame and inside that, there happens to be a glamour photo of me?
Would this have something to do with an old high school chum you ran into yesterday during your holiday from hygiene?
I know it all sounds so silly to you, but you don't understand.
Frasier, I grew up in a tiny town.
And I still care what those people think of me.
And John Coughlin will go back there and totally trash me.
Come on.
You're a beautiful, intelligent woman.
Do you really care what impression the people in your past have about you?
I guess not.
Hello?
Norm Peterson, you old horse thief.
Thanks for calling back so soon.
Yeah, well, you know, just Guess who's got three dates this weekend.
Delicious.
Hi.
Is this Johnny's Steakhouse?
Yeah.
I'd like a table for two at 8:00.
Sure, no problem.
I'll hold.
What the hell are you doing?
- Just making dinner reservations.
- Not that.
- The voice.
- I'm trying my American.
You're certainly trying this American.
Yeah, anything on the patio?
All right.
Cool.
I'll see you then.
You see, I'm just sick of people making such a fuss about my accent.
I'd like to be able to blend in on occasion, - so I'm learning to speak American.
- And who is you tutor?
A drag queen?
You know, it's not very kind of you to mock me.
Especially after I've agreed to clear out for your big date.
Oh, yes.
All right, Daphne.
Thank you very much.
I'll see you later.
You see, that's the problem when I speak American.
I don't know what to do with my R's.
Try hauling it out of here.
- Kimberly, hello.
- Hello.
Frasier, it's so nice to see you again.
Oh, well, let me take your things.
Thank you again for hosting the benefit.
Oh, well, thank you again for chairing.
Listen, did we make as much money as we had hoped to?
Well, we haven't tallied all of it, but I'm guessing the evening will exceed our wildest expectations.
My favourite sort of evening.
I could admire this view for hours.
As could I. Here we are.
- Some wine, perhaps?
- Thank you.
All right.
To possibilities.
So tell me, how did you become interested in the theatre?
Well, actually, I first caught the acting bug back in prep school.
The first production I ever did was A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Not to toot my own horn, but my Bottom received a standing ovation.
I'm not surprised.
And you?
How did you get involved?
Well, I work with a lot of charities.
I actually founded one that promotes pet adoptions.
- Really?
- I'm quite the dog lover.
You?
Oh, heavens yes.
You know, I have a dream of someday owning a big house in the country where I can have as many dogs as I like.
I just love a man who loves animals.
Is it too much to hope you are also a vegetarian?
I just recently became one.
Oh, hey, Fras, the pharmacy left your ointment with the doorman.
Somebody has a date.
Don't worry, honey, it's just for prickly heat.
Thank you, Sherry.
Well, Kimberly Egan, this is my father Martin Crane, - and his companion Sherry Dempsey.
Hi, Kim.
Join us for some peppermint schnapps?
It settles the tummy.
Yes, as much as I could use that right now, I think I'll just pass.
Oh, hey, sweetie.
Tell them that joke you told down at McGinty's.
- No.
Oh, come on.
When she told it, I did an honest-to-God spit take.
I'm not kidding you.
So much beer gushed out of me, I was like Mount St Pauli Girl.
Go on, tell them.
- Actually, you know, I don't think  Okay.
This really horny 80-year-old man goes into a confessional.
- Yeah, you're not Catholic, are you?
- Yes, I am.
Oh, then you're really gonna love it.
So anyway, this horny old guy You know, Sherry, actually, I think we've both heard this joke.
Oh, Marty, I think we're cramping somebody's style.
Oh, hey, before I forget, this is for you.
I couldn't finish my veal chop.
If you wanna know a way to this man's heart, that is his favourite dish.
Veal.
Free range.
Hey, well, listen, we're just gonna take the dog for a walk.
Eddie?
Eddie?
Oh, you locked him in the back room again, didn't you?
- What?
Oh, listen to him.
He's crying, that poor little thing.
Well, I guess you'll need a lot of extra rooms in that dream house to lock up all those dogs.
Good, we can joke about this.
Kimberly.
Please Could I at least call you in a few days?
Go ahead.
- Morning, handsome.
- Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I wondered when you were getting up.
- You hungry?
- Well, a little bit.
How about some Chinese?
Chinese for breakfast?
Who eats that?
About a billion Chinese people.
All right.
I'll get the plates and forks.
Look, why don't we do it authentic this time?
Get the chopsticks.
- No, I don't want to.
- Come on.
I don't feel like it.
Well, look, just try it one time.
It's not hard.
Well, it's not a question of hard.
I just don't like using them.
They don't work.
Well, they've been around a lot longer than forks.
Well, our hands have been around a lot longer than that.
Why don't we just eat everything with our fingers?
Boy, somebody is in a mood.
- I'm not in a mood.
- You are.
Well, I just don't like you telling me to do things that I really don't want to do.
Well, fine.
I will never mention the word "chopsticks" again.
So touchy.
Well, thanks for taking what I said so seriously.
Marty.
Sherry's there for not more than 30 seconds and she chases Kimberly out of the apartment.
I'm sorry, Dr Crane.
That woman sure can be difficult.
You know, this accent business is getting downright annoying.
Well, anyway, I've been trying to call Kimberly all day to apologize and - What are you doing?
- Saying hello to Mr Hicks in security.
You mean, there's a hidden camera up there?
But don't worry about it.
He says lots of people pull down their pants to tuck in their shirts.
Although he did recommend having that rash looked at.
Dear God!
Oh, fine.
Sherry's still here.
She stays later each morning and more nights each week.
This is not what I had in mind when I moved in here.
God, it's bad enough I have to deal with Eddie and Dad and Their shenanigans.
I can't believe you're getting upset over nothing.
I don't consider it nothing.
- I think we should talk about it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
- To not talk about it - is stupid.
- So I'm stupid?
- It sounds like they're arguing.
You're acting stupid.
- Could there be trouble in paradise?
- Yeah.
This is awkward.
Should we let them know we're here?
No, they might stop.
- When did you get back?
- Just now.
Well, don't worry.
We were just talking.
We're finished talking.
Maybe you are.
Marty, I think we should talk about it.
No, I don't want to  My God, I've never heard them talk to each other like that before.
- Dare I get my hopes up?
- Don't count on it.
Once an argument moves into the bedroom, a woman can always get the man to make up.
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- Come on.
Men and women have been having this conversation for centuries.
The woman always says, "Oh, do we really have to fight"?
And then the man would say, "Well, it's your own fault.
You started it".
Well, can't we at least talk this out?
Come on, sit with me on the bed.
- I don't feel like sitting.
- Do you have to be so cold?
Well, you made me angry.
You could at least put your arms around me.
Oh, Daphne, I'm sorry.
You're right.
They've probably made up already.
Well, at least they'll be in a good mood when they come out.
There's nothing like makeup sex.
Daphne, please.
- Sherry and my dad do not have sex.
- Of course they do Daphne.
I have to sleep at night.
My dad and Sherry do not have sex.
So long, kids.
It was nice knowing you.
Did that actually just happen?
I guess I called that one wrong.
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, fine.
Yeah, it was a long time coming.
Are you okay with this?
Well, yeah.
I mean, I'm not jumping up and down.
But, yeah.
I think it's better for both of us.
Yeah.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
Sherry and I had a lot of laughs, but there's a lot of things about her that bug me, and Lord knows, I'm sure she was bugged by a lot of things that I did.
So no.
No, really.
This is fine.
It's fine.
Well, he seems to be taking it very well.
Maybe I should go see if he feels like talking about it.
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Hi, Niles.
Well, actually, it's not a very good time right now.
Well, Dad and Sherry just broke up.
He seems to be taking it okay, I guess, but Well, no, I don't think that's appropriate.
Well, no, it's just too soon for us to be celebrating right now.
It's still too soon, Niles.
- Dr Crane, are you all right?
- Daphne, shh.
Do you hear that?
- What?
- The sound of a Sherry-free apartment.
I've been basking in it for the last 30 minutes.
My God.
I feel like a seafront village after the Vikings have left.
That must be Niles.
- Frasier.
- Niles.
I'd offer you a sherry, but I'm fresh out.
I can't believe Dad finally came to his senses.
- Yes.
- Shall we attempt a high-five?
Well, no No You know what happened the last time.
You got your watchband caught in my hair.
What a relief to finally have things back to normal.
Yes, isn't it.
Hey, Dr Crane.
How's tricks?
- I'm trying my American accent.
Well, stop it.
I mean Just that we Americans are very sensitive about our crude speech patterns.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend.
No, no, no.
It's quite all right.
You have a real flair for accents.
Just out of curiosity, have you ever tried a saucy French chambermaid?
Niles, no.
Frasier's just been telling me how well Dad's taking the breakup with Sherry.
Yeah, a little too well, if you ask me.
Daphne, we've had this discussion already.
He's fine.
He's in a lot more pain than he's letting on.
You don't see it because you like having your apartment back.
Yes.
Well, leave the complex analyses to the professionals.
Oh, hi, Niles.
You feel like going to the movies with me and Daphne?
Thanks, but I have plans.
Listen, Dad, I'm sorry to hear about you and Sherry.
Oh, that's all right.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
It's kind of fun to go back to my old bachelor days, you know.
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Easy come, easy go.
You want a boilermaker?
- No, thanks.
- Oh, well, more for me.
I should pack a few of those for the movies, you know.
Mr Crane Oh, come on.
I'm only kidding.
No.
No, it's kind of fun to laugh at things again.
That was the problem with Sherry.
She had no sense of humour.
Just a real stick in the mud, you know.
We'd better get going.
We'll be late.
I'll get the elevator.
Well, what's your diagnosis now?
It's a clear-cut case of post-Sherry euphoria.
Oh, there are my canapës.
Oh, right.
Date number two.
I'll be off as well.
You can fill me in tomorrow.
You'll get a full debriefing.
As, hopefully, will I. All right, young Edward.
Learn from the master.
Now, just follow these time-honoured traditions, and you too might get lucky with that young Pekinese peach you've been eyeing in the park.
Now, for mood Vivaldi.
And then for lighting not so bright as to show the wrinkles.
Not so dark as to make her think you're hiding anything.
And then finally  Leaving nothing to chance Pouilly-Fuissë, 1992.
The nectar of the gods.
Dear God, I could teach a course.
Adair, come in.
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, thank you.
It's so nice of you to have me over.
- I hope you didn't go to any trouble.
- Oh, nothing special.
I've got to tell you, this is all so strange.
I mean, one night I'm at Dr Frasier Crane's house for a benefit.
And two days later, I'm back at his house for a date.
If there's one thing I've learned, it's that life is nothing without spontaneity.
Come have a look at the city.
Oh, what a lovely view.
I didn't fully appreciate it the other night.
My sentiments exactly.
Here, have some wine?
Oh, certainly.
Here we are.
To possibilities.
I wonder if I can see my apartment from here.
Well, if you can, don't tell me.
I have a telescope, and I am not to be trusted.
Funny, charming.
Next I'm gonna find out you're a great cook.
Well, don't get your hopes up.
Duck comfit?
Oh, good Lord.
Excuse me for just a moment.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Sherry.
My father's not here now.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
Wait, wait.
I just came by to pick something up.
Why don't you tell me what it is.
I'll have it messengered tomorrow.
It's my banjo.
Can't I have it?
Well All right, all right.
Listen, I'm on a date here.
So you know, just try to make it quick.
- Okay.
Hi, how are you?
- She's fine.
She's fine.
We're fine.
All right, you know where you're going.
It's my father's ex-girlfriend.
Well, where were we?
I was about to say that this duck is superb.
Oh, thank you very much.
And the way the wine complements it and the music I'm guessing you entertain often.
Well No, actually, I'm really rather lonely.
Tell you what, take my telescope home.
You can see for yourself.
Got my banjo.
Well, yes, okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye, Frasier.
Oh, it was nice seeing you again.
I'm sorry, have we met?
Well, yes, on your date last night.
Kimberly, isn't it?
- No.
- Well, you've got what you came for.
Off you go.
Well, I'm sorry, hon.
But she does look just like the other girl.
Besides, you were playing the same make-out music.
All right, off you go.
Well, some more wine?
Two dates in two nights isn't bad for someone who's lonely.
Well, you can hardly call what happened last night a date.
The woman that organized the benefit came by.
She just dropped in to say thank you.
Wait a minute.
You mean Kimberly Egan?
- She broke up my first marriage.
- Well, I hardly know the woman.
I mean, she spent all of ten minutes here.
Look, I'm not going through this again.
Oh, Adair, listen.
Listen, this is all in your mind.
I mean, we spent one night together.
She means nothing to me.
Gee, where have I heard that before?
Go ahead.
So for the second time in two nights, Sherry managed to chase away another date.
It's like she's a scarecrow in the cornfield of my love life.
I don't know how many more of your disastrous love stories I can hear.
I'll say when.
Hello.
You look like an almost-presentable version of someone - who works with my brother.
- Bite me.
Oh, it is you.
You haven't seen my high school friend, John, around here, have you?
Well, no, we haven't, Roz.
I suppose you finally tracked him down?
Yeah.
I'm meeting him here for coffee.
I'm gonna tell him I'm on my way to a chic cocktail party.
This is the Roz I want him to talk about when he goes to that wedding this weekend.
The vain, neurotic, lying Roz?
- Oh, are you Roz?
- Yeah.
There was a call for you earlier from a John Coughlin.
He said he's sorry, but he can't meet you.
He had to take an earlier flight.
Oh, great.
- Roz Doyle, right?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
You don't look anything like he described.
All right, before I do anything crazy like go to the airport, fly to Wisconsin and crash a wedding, did I really look that bad the other day?
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hi, Sherry.
Gee, you look familiar.
Did I meet your older sister in here the other day?
Oh, she must be jealous of you.
Taxi!
- Mind if I join you?
- Well, of course not.
I was hoping I'd catch you here.
Well, I've been thinking about what happened yesterday between your Dad and me, and I just can't figure it out.
One minute we were having a stupid argument about chopsticks, and the next minute we were broken up.
Well, I hate to put you on the spot like this, but did he say anything to you?
Well, not really.
You know how closed-mouth Dad is.
It's just Well, he did say that the break-up was a long time coming.
Oh, now I really am confused.
I mean, I thought everything was going fine.
Well, better than fine.
The other night, we both said, "I love you," for the first time.
- You did?
- Yes.
Oh, it's just that in the past he's been rather reserved about expressing himself that way.
Well, I guess he sort of hesitated before he said it, but, I mean, a lot of guys do that when you spring it on them for the first time.
Yes, well, I can certainly understand why you're confused.
Well If you'd like, I could speak to him on your behalf.
- Ow.
I'm sorry.
Was that your shin?
No.
No, thanks, Frasier.
I don't wanna put you in the middle of this.
I'm just frustrated.
Listen.
Thanks for listening.
- No problem.
- Anytime.
You know, I really thought I hit the jackpot with Marty.
It isn't easy finding someone you think the world of.
Oh, I know, you go tomcatting around with a different girl every night, but you can't find happiness that way.
I haven't so far.
Ow!
- I didn't kick you that hard.
- You didn't have to kick me at all.
Were you seriously considering playing therapist to Dad and that woman after we got rid of her?
I have no intention of repairing the rift.
God.
But last night for the first time in months, I wasn't jolted awake at 2 a.m. By her rousing rendition of "Foggy Mountain Breakdown".
It seems a little odd that Dad chose to break up with Sherry just after he told her that he loved her.
As I recall, she said he hesitantly said it back to her.
That's a clear picture of a man who didn't share her feelings.
Yes, well, I think he does share her feelings.
- He just panicked out of fear.
- Fear of what?
Well, lots of things.
Change.
Commitment.
Becoming vulnerable to somebody again.
I'm afraid he broke up with her for all the wrong reasons.
Well, if he'd like a list of the right reasons, it's available on request.
The least I can do is have a talk with him.
No, the least you can do is nothing.
Dad hasn't asked for our help.
We should let nature take its course.
It's like one of those wildlife films with the lion chasing the antelope.
You don't ask why the photographer doesn't interfere.
You just accept it.
As a general rule, Niles, the photographer is not related to the antelope.
Obviously, you and I don't see eye-to-eye on this issue.
- Where are you going?
- I have a date in 45 minutes, and a bleeding antelope sitting in a Barcalounger in my apartment.
I suppose that sounded strange to you.
I'd be happy to explain it.
Are you, by any chance, free at the end of your shift?
Sorry.
I've still got it.
Not so fast, Mr Hicks.
You won't catch me doing anything foolish.
Daphne.
Hello, Dr Crane.
- Enjoy your evening.
- Yes, you too.
He's been under a lot of stress lately.
Oh, Dad, listen, I'm glad you're home.
We've gotta talk.
No good conversation ever started that way.
We have to talk about you and Sherry.
Why?
Look, I'm fine with it.
- Come on, now let it go.
- Dad.
Listen, I spoke with Sherry today.
You did what?
What for?
Well, she came to see me.
Said she was a bit confused about what happened the other day.
Well, from her story, I think what you're contending with here is a classic case of panic induced by fear of commitment.
You hear that, Eddie?
That's what buys your dog food.
Well, she told me about a little incident that took place the other evening where she expressed her feelings for you, - and you hesitantly reciprocated.
- Oh, jeez.
She told you about that?
Look, to cut it short, she told me how she felt about me.
I said it back, but I only said it because I felt I had to.
That's not really what I feel.
So end of story.
Now, there's my date.
Listen, I'm sorry for butting into your life, but I happen to be concerned about you.
You may find this hard to believe, but your welfare happens to be very important to me.
- Hi, Frasier.
- Sherry.
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey.
You left your Sinatra tape in my car.
Oh, thanks.
I've been looking for that.
Well, here you go.
- Bye.
- So long.
I saw that, Dad.
I saw the way you looked at her.
You can't convince me you don't feel the same way about her.
Look, I appreciate what you're doing, Frasier.
I really do.
But stop!
All right, fine.
It's your life.
I wouldn't interfere.
Sherry, wait.
If you could just stay for a few minutes, - I think I can straighten this out.
- It didn't look like he wanted you to.
Yes, he's just being his old stubborn, ornery self.
- I do miss that.
- All right.
I'll go talk to him You stay here.
- Frasier?
- Oh, Leslie.
Sorry.
I'm a little early.
- Way to go, Fras.
- Oh, dear God.
Sherry, this is Leslie.
Leslie, Sherry.
- Leslie, come on in.
- Hi.
Frasier, could I use the little girl's room?
No.
No need to ask.
Come on in.
- May I take your coat?
- Of course.
- Yes, there we are.
Thank you.
Yes, well, you see, Sherry is my father's lady friend, and they're going through a bit of a rough patch.
If you can excuse me, I have to talk with him for just one minute.
Take your time.
I can always chat with Sherry.
No, no.
What, and miss this fabulous sunset?
Isn't that something?
Wow.
It's even more stunning than I remember.
Yes, it is.
Excuse me for a minute.
Oh, no, wait.
Here, some wine?
Here we are.
To possibilities.
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, don't worry.
I won't get in the way.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Well, it's no trouble at all, Dad.
- Dad, you and Sherry - Oh, jeez, I don't believe this.
Frasier, it's over.
She's gone.
She's out of my life.
What the hell's she doing here?
Look, she came in to borrow the powder room.
I'll be right back.
How's everything out here?
- Fine.
- How's everything in there?
Fine, fine.
I think I just I need a few more minutes.
Were you through with the powder room?
Oh, sure, it's all yours.
Oh, Frasier, take all the time you need.
- Yes.
Thanks.
- I'll entertain your friend.
Oh, what?
And miss this fabulous sunset?
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
Yes.
- I forgot how beautiful it is.
Yes.
So it is.
Yeah.
Oh, right.
Here.
To poss Oh, what am I doing?
Here.
All right, just enjoy yourself.
Two minutes.
No more.
Oh, not you, Leslie.
I don't know what you think you're doing, but go back and get rid of her.
- Dad, I am not trying to torture you.
- You're doing a bad job.
All right, listen.
I'm a little bit confused about something.
Maybe you can help me understand it.
You say you don't have any feelings for this woman.
Why is it that the last three months you've been happier than you've been - since Mom died?
- You leave your mother out of this.
- I didn't mean to bring her into it.
- Well, good.
Dad, is that what this is about?
Mom?
- No.
All right?
- Listen, I'm a psychiatrist I don't need a psychiatrist, and I don't need your help.
- That is just classic defensiveness.
- Would you just drop it?
- No, I won't drop it.
- I said drop it!
Listen, Dad, will you?
Excuse me.
Butterfingers.
Momentito.
Now listen, Dad, l I do not mean to upset you.
I have a feeling that what you're going through here is feelings of guilt.
It's probably natural to feel that way.
My God, I understand what you're going through.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
You don't understand at all.
When you've been married for 35 years, you'd never thought there'd be anybody else.
Then one day you hear yourself say, "I love you," to another woman.
Well, maybe then you'll understand what I'm going through.
Dad, there was a time back when my first marriage was breaking up.
I was talking to Mom.
She said, "You've gotta promise you're not gonna give up".
I said, "The last thing I wanna hear is a bunch of clichës about how we're all put on this Earth to love one another, and how it's certainly possible for the heart to love more than one person".
I said, "All right, Mom, give me one good reason for me to ever let myself fall in love again".
She said, "Because I said so, and I'm your mother".
Yeah, it sure doesn't help reminding me what a great lady she was.
Well, does it help to remind you that Sherry's a pretty great lady too?
God, Dad, she makes you happy.
Niles and I would give anything to have what you have.
Well, not what you have but what you have.
Yeah, she is a pretty great lady, isn't she?
I don't know.
She'd probably be better off with some guy who wasn't going through all this stuff.
Well, don't you think you ought to let her decide that?
Hi.
Hi.
Well, it looks like those two could use a little privacy.
Do you mind if I take you to the restaurant a little early?
- I think that's a good idea.
Okay.
We can finish up with wine later.
I mean Well, not that I mean we're gonna be coming back here.
Not that I'm averse to that, of course.
I mean, if you're in the mood for a nightgown.
Nightcap.
It looks like your dad and his girlfriend are patching things up.
Yes.
Gee, I can't thank you enough for being tolerant about the time delay.
Oh, no problem.
- Look, you'd be surprised.
I mean, lately women just fly into rages of intolerance just at the slightest provocation.
Well, shall we?
Wait, Leslie, before you go, I want to say something.
Oh, good Lord.
Step lively.
Listen, you are a lucky girl to be with someone as sweet as Frasier.
He just did a real nice thing for his dad and me.
Thank you, Sherry.
Off we go.
We'll ride down with you.
We're going down the street to get a little Chinese.
- Well, why don't we give you a lift?
- No.
Don't you think the walk would do them good?
Oh, no, I think it's starting to rain.
Come on, you'll ride with us.
Oh, you are such a doll.
- So, Leslie, what do you do?
Oh, I'm a dermatologist.
Good news, Frasier.
If you get lucky tonight, - she might look at that rash of yours.
Yep.
Oh, that reminds me of a great joke.
No!
Just hold the elevator for me, will you?
Eddie?
Well, you could at least act surprised.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Morning, sunshine.
Morning, Sherry.
- Coffee's on.
Want a cuppa?
No, thank you.
Caffeine only weakens the immune system.
I'm fighting off a flu.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me get you some breakfast.
- That's really not necessary.
No.
You'll feel much better once you've had my scrambled-egg tacos and Spam patties.
In keeping with the trusty adage: "Starve a cold, disgust a fever".
- Tea and dry toast?
- Oh, bless you.
- Oh, honey, I was using that.
- Oh, sorry.
Well, no problem.
Listen, why don't you just relax.
I'll clean up later.
You know, not to criticize, but I usually serve Mr Crane whole-grain cereal for breakfast.
- I try to avoid giving him fried foods.
- Oh, Marty loves fried foods.
Yes, well, just because he likes something doesn't mean it's good for him.
True.
But just because something's good for him doesn't mean that he has to be stuck with it day after day.
Oh, looks like it's gonna be another scorcher.
Mm-hm.
Radio said high 90s.
- Yes, it's hot.
- Yeah.
Well, I guess there'll be some more brownouts.
Hate to think what it's gonna do to the crops.
- Dad, please, I'm trying to read.
- Oh, sure.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Oh, double homicide last night.
Yeah, with this heat wave, though, I'm not surprised.
Yeah, wonder what started that.
Perhaps someone wouldn't stop talking about the weather.
Hey, you might be right.
It's a real scorcher out there.
- Morning, handsome.
Oh, hey, hey.
Did I say that before?
Before and after.
Please, would you two spare me the single entendre this morning?
I'm trying to avoid getting sick.
Well, there's nothing like one of mama's big biscuits if you're fighting something off.
Yes.
I'm sure with good aim, it could bring down an elk.
- How about you, sweetie?
- Just half of one for me.
Oh, come on.
It wouldn't hurt you to put on a few pounds.
Men like to see a little oomph in your walk-away.
Yeah, you ought to see them smile when Sherry leaves the room.
I can imagine.
Now, you're so pretty.
I don't understand why men aren't just buzzing around you.
Frasier?
You're not seeing anybody.
Here you are, under the same roof, both cute as corn.
- Why don't you?
Just stop right there.
I'm trying to have a peaceful morning.
I do not want to be put on the spot, and I do not want to eat some bizarre concoction, and I do not want to discuss the weather.
I just wanna try to conserve energy, sit here and enjoy my paper.
Sure, Fras.
You idiot!
I'm gonna break every bone in your fat little body!
If you weren't a girl, and I didn't like this, I'd be pounding you.
Bup, bup, bup!
Not another word!
- But he - But!
I don't care who did what to whom or in what disgusting manner.
As we speak, hordes of viral Visigoths are hurtling themselves over the battlements of my immune system, laying waste to my Oh, dear God, do you see how weak I am?
I can't even finish a simple Visigoth metaphor.
If you get sick, don't go sneezing on everything.
The last time the Happy Chef had a cold, I was picking lettuce off the mike for a week.
- You will not believe what - Roz, I meant what I said.
I simply cannot deal with other people's problems today.
Well, good news for Mark on line three, whose wife is keeping a pumpkin in a bassinet.
Hey, I know what'll make you feel better.
My friend Lisa's having a singles' party.
I'm supposed to bring someone I'm not interested in, but who's a really good catch.
I need my rest.
Even if I didn't, I do not wanna be poked and prodded by a bunch of desperate alcohol-lubricated husband-hunters.
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.
- Cheryl from sales was asking.
- Cheryl?
The one who, at the last company wedding, hip-checked you into the ice sculpture in a headlong rush to catch the bouquet?
That is not what happened.
She thought the bartender said, "Last call".
Look, Roz, I'm not gonna fight anymore, but I want you to know you said a lot of things that really hurt my feelings.
Fun is fun, but I'm not made of stone.
So I want you to know, as of this moment, we work together, but we are no longer friends.
- Wanna go to a party tonight?
- I'm there.
Ready to do your exercises?
- No, in a minute.
- Just a couple more hands.
- You said that half an hour ago.
I must be a bad influence.
Yeah, next thing you know, you'll have me smoking behind the gym.
I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.
I want you down on your back in two minutes and no arguments.
Sounds a lot better when you say it.
Hello.
Speaking.
Oh, she did, did she?
Well, Sherry was mistaken.
I don't go out with people I've never met.
Thank you anyway.
I can't believe it.
You gave my number to a total stranger!
I thought it'd be a nice surprise.
You're not seeing anybody.
Kenny is a great guy.
He said his name was Jack.
Oh, I forgot about Jack.
There's more than one?
I hope you're a lot nicer to Kenny when he calls.
He has a boat.
Why don't you just squeeze me into a pair of hot pants and drop me off down by the docks?
Maybe you wouldn't be so touchy if you didn't wake up on the wrong side of no one every morning.
That's your answer to everything: Sex.
It's like you're part rabbit.
People ought to rub your feet for luck.
You don't wanna say anything you're gonna regret.
Now, you're acting like a couple of fishwives.
See, I'm regretting that one already.
Maybe I'd be less touchy if I hadn't spent half the day cleaning up after you, and the other half on the phone with the garbage-disposal repairman because one of your bloody big biscuits broke the blade.
That's a lot of B words for a little girl.
Here's one you forgot!
- Don't you dare.
- What do you mean, don't I dare?
Come on Is Seattle experiencing a Prozac shortage?
!
Daphne and Sherry are having a little problem.
Actually, maybe you can settle it.
It was all I could do to get through my show.
King Solomon has split his last baby for the day.
My health is hanging by a thread.
Bup, bup, bup!
You're just gonna have to settle this amongst yourselves.
Quietly.
You've got a lot of nerve talking to me that way.
Me?
You're the one who started it.
Didn't she, Martin?
- You're not putting me in this.
- I didn't start anything.
You've had your big conk in my business all day!
- That better mean nose!
- And what if it doesn't?
- Oh!
- Hey, come on!
Knock it off!
Now, I said I didn't wanna get involved in this, but Oh, Daphne, you know, Sherry was only trying to be nice.
Of course you'd take her side.
She's the one who keeps your hammertoes warm at night.
- What the hell's that mean?
- Well, figure it out.
Oh, come on, Daph   Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Baby, go to your perch.
Go to your perch.
Daphne.
I'm so sorry to bother you, Dr Crane, but I had an awful row with Sherry, and I can't go back there.
I tried a couple of my girlfriends, but they weren't home.
So may I spend the night here?
Relax, Dr Crane.
I'm just unbuttoning your shirt.
Are you feeling any better?
Yes.
I don't know what happened.
My knees never buckled like that before.
The wine and the heat must have made me dizzy.
Yeah, it is rather steamy in here.
I apologize for the lack of air conditioning.
It seems in order to live in an exclusive landmark building, one must be willing to sweat through the odd heat wave like a tortured character in a Tennessee Williams play.
I can't imagine what you must be thinking.
Me barging in, asking to spend the night.
Well, gee, I'm just thinking so many things.
Sherry just makes me so mad.
She's been giving my number to strange men so they'll call and ask me out.
How dare she.
Why would she do such a thing?
- Because she says I'm too rigid.
- Oh, nonsense.
- And that I'm too picky.
- Poppycock.
And that I'd be much happier if I just went out and had sex with someone.
Just to play devil's advocate - Don't tell me you agree with her.
- No.
No, it's much too hot for hell to have frozen over.
I mean, it's like caveman thinking.
"All Daphne needs is a quick roll in the hay".
- Yes, well - "A little slap and tickle would solve all her problems".
Yeah.
The worst part is I think she might be right.
Maybe part of why I got so mad at her is because she hit a nerve.
That's very possible.
I mean, I've been keeping myself on the shelf lately.
I'm feeling a little like the good china.
Someone should be eating off you every day.
Music?
Lovely.
You know, I hope this doesn't sound terribly forward, but Oh, I'm so hot.
I'd really love to get out of these sweaty clothes.
Would it be all right if I took a cool bath?
Yes, of course.
- It's upstairs.
Third door on your left.
- Thank you.
There are fresh towels in the linen closet.
Use the Indian cotton.
It'll be more gentle on your skin.
Oh, Dr Crane, you're always thinking of me.
You have no idea.
Dr Crane?
Oh, that fan feels good.
Oh, dear.
Sorry about the fan.
- Oh, no.
That's quite all right.
- There we go.
Thank you for lending me your dressing gown.
Don't you just love the feel of silk on your skin?
Oh, yes, there's nothing quite like it.
Passion fruit?
- Thank you.
- Here you are.
You know, if you keep treating me like this, I'll never want to leave.
Champagne?
You shouldn't have.
I love champagne, but it's It's a drink for two, and I never have anyone to share it with.
Yes, there are things you miss when you're on your own.
Champagne.
Another person's touch.
Even if it's just holding hands.
I guess you've been missing that sort of thing too, since you and Mrs Crane split up.
Actually, Maris never held hands.
She had a slight webbing.
It made her self-conscious.
Well l'm sure there are other intimacies you miss.
Well, naturally, I still have a longing for - That is, I have a desire to have - Sex?
- Fruit?
- Pardon?
- I mean, yes, sex.
- I'd love some.
- I mean fruit.
- Fruit, yes.
- Although sex is good too.
- Oh, well I'm sorry, Dr Crane.
I guess I just have sex on the mind tonight.
Well Well, that happens.
This weather doesn't help, does it?
The heat gets inside you.
It makes you so aware of your body.
It's like nature's way of letting you know you're still an animal.
God, it's hot in here.
- Getting hotter every minute.
- Ice?
Oh, yes, I could use some right now.
Oh, yes.
That is better.
Where's your piece?
Melted.
I'll get another.
You know, unless it cools down, I'm afraid we won't be getting much sleep tonight.
Shame we have just the one fan.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Yes, that is a shame.
The two of us and just one fan.
Well, of course, you're the host.
You take it.
No, no, no.
I couldn't sleep at all knowing you were in the next room all hot and hot.
Well, I suppose under the circumstances, we could both sleep in the same room.
It does oscillate.
- What?
- The fan.
- Oh, dear.
- What?
It's time to take my pills.
I forgot all about them.
- They're back at the apartment.
- What pills?
It's my thyroid.
Nothing serious, just a bit overactive.
If I don't take my pills, I tend to faint dead away.
What's the point of having a fainting couch if you can't use it?
I'll just run over and get them.
I'll come right back.
No.
We'll go together, and I'll run up for you.
If you and Sherry get in the same room you might make up more reasons to fight with one another.
Well, you did the best you could.
I know, but I suppose I shouldn't have gotten on her so hard.
She's trying to do stuff here.
I know.
It's true.
That's right too.
We don't have much privacy either.
But I think Kenny is the perfect person.
Kenny would be great.
Don't you think so?
Nilesie!
- Where did you come from?
- What're you doing here?
Daphne's taking refuge at my apartment for the night.
I just stopped by - to get a few of her things.
- Back.
You were just gonna let us worry all night?
- I was gonna tell you on my way out.
This is stupid.
I'm gonna call her and get her back here.
We'll work this out.
It's a waste of time.
She's so upset, there's no way she will ever set foot in this apartment tonight.
If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.
I just remembered, my pills aren't in the cabinet.
They're on the dresser.
What courage, pulling yourself together.
Just scurry to the car, I'll only be a moment.
Daphne.
Sherry and I talked, and we really feel bad about this.
The whole thing is just a misunderstanding.
If you want, I suppose we could sit down and talk it out.
Well, I suppose we could.
Obviously, these two wildcats can't come to terms.
The best thing will be for them to be apart.
- I know.
I'm a psychiatrist.
No, no, no.
Your dad is right.
Now, Daphne just misunderstood.
I didn't exactly misunderstand.
You did set me up with a total stranger.
Oh, but he's not a stranger.
He comes in the bar all the time.
Oh, a barfly.
Much better.
- Oh, there you go again.
- Me?
!
You know, you two are really a lot alike.
No, we're not!
- I am not like her!
How can you say that?
Talk amongst yourselves.
I mean, all I was trying to do - He's probably an alcoholic!
- He is not an alcoholic.
You think I'd let you go out with a?
Oh, honey  A busybody, that's what you are.
Frasier?
I'm taking a bath.
Bubbles?
They're aroma-therapeutic.
And exactly what part of "I'm taking a bath" did you take to mean "Come on in"?
Well, I'm sorry to tax your delicate system, but Daphne's back, and she and Sherry are at again, and now she says she's gonna stay overnight with Niles, and this is your department.
Unless blood has been spilled, and on a carpeted area, I don't care.
- Now get out.
Oh, there you are.
Marty, I tried, but that girl has no manners whatsoever.
- Hey, Frasier.
- Do you mind?
!
I knew I'd find you in here.
Whatever they're telling you, it's not true.
- Daphne, you can't come in here.
- Why not?
She can.
No, she can't!
No one can!
Frasier, have you no decency?
Daphne, let's go.
All right, I am moments away from succumbing once and for all to this flu, but I will take one stab at this, and then I am going to sink hippopotamus-like beneath the bubbles.
I think what this all comes down to is a dispute over turf.
Daphne and Sherry are like two animals scent-marking their territory, which in this case is you, Dad.
You couldn't come up with a less disgusting comparison?
All right, fine.
It's like the Roman Emperor Tiberius.
His mother, Livia, and wife, Vipsania.
- What?
- Huh?
- Who?
- Go on.
All right.
Daphne, your primary role in this household is to take care of Dad.
Sherry, you also enjoy taking care of Dad.
I suspect that your attempts to find Daphne a boyfriend are really an unconscious ploy to get her out of the way.
It's unconscious.
Daphne, actually, you're threatened by this.
You feel that you're no longer needed.
I have been feeling a bit unwanted lately.
A night without your services will have them singing a different tune.
Let's go.
Yes, Niles, no one's gonna be singing anything tonight, all right?
Daphne.
I think we now all understand why you stormed out of here earlier.
A strong emotion like not feeling wanted can drive anyone to a rash and impulsive act.
Yes, it nearly did.
I mean, yes, it did.
Yes, well, at the root of this, you're both just feeling insecure.
Exactly.
It very possibly could've been avoided if Dad had been sensitive enough to remind you that you're both important in his life.
What're you saying, that it's my fault?
Well, I must admit, a few reassuring words might just have done the trick.
Marty does have difficulty expressing his feelings.
No, I don't.
- Oh, Sherry - Oh, save it, honey.
- It wasn't our fault.
- Yes, it was!
You said that she was skinny, and you said she was a bigmouth.
That is not important.
- We all feel better now.
- Well, I don't.
Well, all right, look, I am running out of patience.
I am running out of strength.
And I'm running out of bubbles.
Please, the lecture has ended!
- You're a good psychiatrist, Dr Crane.
- You sure are, hon.
You see, Marty?
It isn't just a lot of hooey.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.
Please, Niles.
Look, unconsciously, you knew that it wasn't right.
That's why you brought Daphne back here.
No, we came back to fetch her damn thyroid pills.
You're a doctor.
Why didn't you just use your prescription pad?
Oh, my God.
Isn't there an all-night pharmacy across the street from your building?
Oh, my God.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Well, that's our show for today.
But before we close, I'd like to invite you all to join us here at KACL in wishing a fond farewell to our Happy Chef, Leo Pascale, as he bubble-wraps his crepe pan and heads south towards sunny Santa Fe.
Leo, you stirred us with your passion melted us with your charm, added spice to our lives.
Now, as you whisk yourself away let's not say goodbye, but rather tartare for now.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.
Well, at least you stopped short of saying, "I'll be fricasseeing you".
You ready to go to Leo's party?
Oh, dear God, there is nothing I detest more than a KACL goodbye party.
They're all the same.
Twist-top wine and a bunch of people standing around awkwardly, trying to summon up some affection for someone they hardly even know.
It always ends up reeking of insincerity.
What are we gonna do, doc?
He's leaving us.
- Bulldog and Leo were tight.
- Well, Bulldog certainly is.
I love that guy, man.
He'd give me all his leftovers.
I warned Leo, you keep feeding him, he'll keep coming back.
- Are you going to the party?
- Actually, I think I'm gonna pass.
Come on.
Doc, you gotta at least have a drink, give him a hug.
That is precisely what I'm trying to avoid.
When did we become a society of huggers?
Oh, we hug for everything nowadays.
I mean, "Hello".
Hug.
"Congratulations".
Hug.
"Nice haircut".
Hug.
It's absurd.
I mean, if we want to express some real emotion for someone, - where is there left to go?
- I've had good luck with the storage closet.
You know, I think you're way too uptight about this.
No, no, no, I see the doc's point.
We all have different ways of saying goodbye.
Me, I prefer this method.
Get out!
Come on!
I got a show to do.
Well, I think hugging is very healthy.
I read somewhere that if you have physical contact on a regular basis, it can actually extend your life.
Well, in that case, you should outlive Styrofoam.
- Frasier, you made it.
- Well, Leo, you know I wouldn't miss - saying goodbye to you for the world.
We're gonna miss you so much.
We sure are.
Oh, what the heck.
You have no idea how hard this is for me.
Thank you.
I must say, Niles, that is a striking tie you're wearing.
Thank you.
It was a gift from Maris.
She had it made for me to commemorate the end of that dreadful winter she had her obesity scare.
Oh, yes.
I remember her struggle to lose that holiday pound.
Yes.
After she'd restored her figure, she had Yoshi set fire to a hippopotamus topiary she felt had taunted her.
Yeah.
Then, as a visual reminder never to let herself go again, she had this tie made for me out of the legs of her fat pants.
Thank you.
You know, I would think wearing a tie that Maris gave you might make you feel a little bit melancholy.
On the contrary.
I have every reason to believe Maris and I - may be on the road to reconciliation.
- Really?
- We met for lunch today.
- Mm-hm.
I told her I couldn't stand being in separation limbo any more, and unless she wanted the marriage to end, - we simply had to get into counselling.
- And she agreed?
Her exact words were "I'll think about it," but I saw a twinkle in her eye I have not seen since the neighbour children discovered our new electric fence.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- The foam is a tad listless today.
- Yes.
I can tell without looking they've got Chad back on steamer duty.
You are good.
- Excuse me, Dr Niles Crane?
- I am.
- Here.
Oh.
Who's sending me this?
"Notice.
Petition for divorce".
- Sorry, man.
Cool tie.
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh It's all right.
Would have been nice if we'd given therapy a try, but so be it.
It's little consolation, but you're to be applauded for how you're handling this.
A lesser man would panic.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I'll get her back.
You have too much dignity to let yourself beg.
Please give me my phone back.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop it!
Listen, I know you're upset now, but remember why you left Maris in the first place.
You were tired of grovelling.
Yes, but I'm rested now.
Fine.
Go ahead and toddle on back to Maris.
Let her grind you under her boot heel for another 12 years, rob you of whatever self-respect you've retained.
Then we can have this conversation all over again!
- I was unhappy, wasn't I?
- You were miserable.
I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to take in.
Twelve years of my life, gone.
Oh, don't think of it as a loss, but rather an opportunity for growth.
- It's not an ending, it's - Frasier.
No offence, but I'm familiar with all the platitudes.
I've just been served divorce papers.
I need a little time to let it sink in.
If you don't mind, maybe we could not talk about it for a while.
- Of course.
- Hi.
Can I get you guys anything?
No, thank you.
We've already been served.
Sorry.
- Oh, you're back.
- Yeah, I never should have left.
The park was a disaster.
You remember that outfit Mrs Foster knitted Eddie for Christmas?
Well, I bumped into her in the lobby, and she said she was gonna be going to the park.
And I thought it would be rude if I didn't at least have him wear it one time, you know?
Eddie, get in here.
Look at the poor guy.
He's humiliated.
And then, of course, she didn't even show up.
But you know who was there?
Duke.
And two guys from the old precinct.
"Glad to see you've got something to do, now that you're retired".
"Hey, Marty, if I buy you some wool, would you knit something for me"?
Well, it could have been worse.
You could have been wearing the hat she made for you.
Oh, dear.
Would you take that off him?
He just looks so pathetic.
Oh, come here, you poor little fella.
- What's in the box?
- Oh, nothing.
Just some old stuff I was taking down to the storage bin.
- Great.
Why don't you take this with it.
- Yeah, just set that on top.
No, no, it'll fall off if I do.
Hey, this is my stuff.
- It's a box of junk.
- It's not junk.
Oh, rubbish.
It's a bunch of useless gadgets you haven't used in years.
Like this remote control to God knows what.
Useless.
Just like this, whatever it is.
That's a Steam Master 2000, like on TV.
"Live life wrinkle-free".
It even comes with an attachment that cooks Chinese vegetables.
It's Niles.
I'm taking him to lunch to get his mind off his troubles.
- Something we shouldn't talk about?
- No reason we shouldn't talk about it.
I don't think he's ready to talk about it, so we're not.
Would you mind not talking about it a little less loudly?
Niles.
- Afternoon, all.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hi, Niles.
I appreciate your concern, but I'm really doing quite well with all of this.
- Everything's gonna be fine.
That's good.
I just hope you got a good divorce lawyer.
You've been married a long time, you gotta make sure you get your fair share.
Well, according to the terms of our prenuptial agreement, I believe I'm wearing my fair share.
Well, take a tip from your old man.
You get over there and take possession of your personal belongings before they box them up and toss them out.
When will you just admit that this junk belongs in a dustbin?
You know, I was on a case once where the wife constantly nagged the husband like this.
"You never put anything in the garbage.
Why don't you put anything in the garbage"?
- Well, he should've listened to her.
- He did.
That's where we found her.
You know, I think Daphne's fighting an uphill battle with this project of hers.
- What's that?
- It's a journal.
Look at this.
Isn't that Mother's handwriting?
These must be notes from one of her research projects.
"It's hard to imagine two male siblings who could be more different than Frasier and Niles".
Good heavens, it's about us.
"Though both are highly intelligent, Frasier is clearly the more dominant of the two, while Niles remains extremely passive".
Fascinating.
"Frasier never seems to get enough at mealtime.
He's nearly twice the size of Niles, and often, when he thinks I'm not looking, steals his brother's food".
"What Niles lacks in assertiveness, he makes up for in an abnormally fussy grooming regimen".
"Frasier is exhibiting clearly antisocial tendencies.
In fact, he is extremely uncomfortable with touch, seeming to recoil from all human contact".
Where does it say that?
All right, I added "extremely," but it's right there.
Good Lord.
This cuts rather close to the bone.
Just yesterday Roz was accusing me of the same thing.
I always thought it was just an aversion to social hugging, but apparently it goes deeper than that.
You know, maybe this is something I should work on.
What do you think?
Niles.
"April 3rd.
Niles remains as docile as ever.
He constantly allows himself to be cowed and dominated, especially by females".
Well, you shouldn't let that upset you.
You've broken that pattern.
You could've knuckled under and gone grovelling back to Maris, but you didn't.
You know, Niles, I don't think I've ever been more proud of you.
- Oh, Frasier, this is awful.
- Well, pardon me for trying.
I am new at it.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I did go grovelling back.
What?
I sent the divorce papers back unsigned, along with a letter begging her to take me back.
- Oh, Niles, you didn't.
- Of course I did.
You read the journal.
It's who I am.
- Well, how did she respond?
- Well, she hasn't yet.
I just messengered it to her this morning.
It's her spa day.
She won't be home until I still have time to get that letter back.
- I'm going with you.
- You're a good brother.
This may be my last chance to prove once and for all that I'm not the sort of man who Whatever Mother said.
Constantly allows himself to be cowed and dominated, especially by females.
- I might've known you'd memorize it.
- I'm sorry.
You're right, that was harsh.
Come here.
Oh, get away from me.
I'm still uneasy about this.
What if one of the servants sees us?
Lmpossible.
They always use Maris' spa day to play hooky.
I just hope she hasn't changed the locks.
What do you know?
You know, this is sort of exciting.
Even as a child, I always fancied I might make a first-rate society cat burglar.
I think I'm right.
Yes.
All it takes is stealth, cunning and a key to the door.
The letter should be over here with the rest of Maris' unopened mail.
Yeah, there it is.
Let's go.
Frasier, look, it's my puppies.
Oh, I've missed you.
Hello, Gestalt.
Hello, Gerhardt.
Don't they look just a bit agitated to you?
Well, that's because they're excited to see the lord has returned to the manor.
Hello, boys.
Oh, my God.
She hasn't changed the locks, she changed the dogs.
- Maybe we can make it to the front.
- Right.
- They're toying with us.
- What are we going to do?
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to wait until Lady Baskerville comes back from the spa!
And explain our presence how?
I do see your point.
We have to find some way to distract those beasts and make our escape.
Wait.
Tuesday is Swedish meatball night for the staff.
Cook always keeps them in the refrigerator.
No, we can't feed them raw meat.
It'll stimulate their blood lust.
Listen.
One of our old dogs used to be spooked by thunderstorms.
The vet told us half of one of Maris' green pills would allow him to sleep safely through the storm.
- You get the meat, I'll get the pills.
- Right.
Wait.
What if Maris is out of pills?
- Oh, I see.
- Thank you, Frasier, I needed that.
Niles, that's three meatballs in a row right in the koi pond.
Stop trying to throw!
Just drop them.
You can drop straight, can't you?
- Was that a splat or a splash?
- A splat!
Do it again.
Excellent, they're eating it.
All right, that's enough.
Good boys.
Yeah, that's right.
Eat hardy.
Oh, you missed one.
Right over there in the garden by the tulips.
Oh, there's a few more there in the koi pond, next to the sleeping koi.
Niles.
This painting here in the living room.
You've always had this?
The one of Maris and me in the garden?
It was commissioned on our third anniversary.
It must be a different painting.
This is Maris next to a really big tree.
No, there's no tree in that painting.
It's Oh, my God.
She's had me completely painted out.
I don't think I can take much more of this.
Well, in that case, I wouldn't look too closely at the face of that skunk in the flowerbed.
Well, I suppose it's only fitting that I be commemorated in this household as a laughingstock.
She's always run roughshod over me.
Look around.
This entire room is a monument to my spinelessness.
- How so?
- Well This Dresden shepherdess?
A peace offering I made to Maris when I was foolish enough to point out an extra syllable in a haiku she'd written.
Choose another item.
Anything.
- Oh, that candelabra.
- Louis Quatorze.
What better way to apologize for the time I attempted to grow a moustache?
I think you owe us all a candelabra for that.
Niles, look, it seems to be working.
The dogs are getting drowsy.
You know, if just once Maris had given in, in all those years, I might think there was hope for our marriage.
But she never budged an inch.
Even on those rare occasions when I reported back to you that I had prevailed - I knew.
- Yeah.
I don't know why I thought I could convince her with that couples-therapy idea.
Well I'm not going to be her whipping boy anymore.
What are you doing?
I'm signing the divorce papers.
If she wants to initiate proceedings, let's proceed.
Niles, you know I'll support any decision you make, but are you sure?
Absolutely.
That's done.
Are you okay?
I will be.
Looks like the dogs are asleep.
Shall we go?
Oh, I don't know.
You know, maybe they're just playing possum with us.
Oh, frankly, I don't care.
After what I've just done, you think I'm gonna let a couple dogs frighten me?
This is the last time I'm leaving this house.
I'm going to walk through that door with my head held high.
Good for you.
I'm gonna run like hell out the front door.
Wait up.
Now, the beauty of the Hot 'n' Foamy is the ultra-quick heating action.
You just plug it in, and two minutes later, presto.
Guess what comes out.
Well, the obvious answer would be shaving cream, so I'll go with music.
You had a lot of sassy things to say about my clothes steamer too.
But didn't those snow peas taste delicious?
Hello.
Hey.
- Where did you two slip off to?
- Oh, I just had some papers to sign.
- Thanks.
- Yes.
Niles has decided to begin divorce proceedings.
- I'm sorry, Dr Crane.
- It's okay.
I feel good about it.
Now, we thought it might be nice to have a family dinner this evening at Chez Shea, so we stopped by to invite the two of you to join us.
Oh, that would be nice.
I'll just go freshen up.
Yeah, sounds great.
And, Niles, I'm proud of you.
I know this isn't easy, but in the long run, I know you'll be happier.
I'm damn sure I will be.
Well, I can't believe it.
It's really over.
And if you choose, you never have to see Maris again.
Oh, please.
Half the time I couldn't see her when she was standing right in front of me.
Oh, my.
- I can't breathe.
- Niles No, really, I can't breathe.
Frasier, I signed divorce papers.
What was I thinking?
God, you're not having second thoughts.
I don't know.
When I was caught up in the adrenaline, it all seemed fine, but now in the clear light of day It's natural to feel a little shaky, but, believe me, you made the right decision.
- How do I know that?
- Let's just check what prompted us to it.
Here.
"Niles is incapable of asserting himself, especially in front of females".
- Keep going.
This is helping.
- "As I write this, he lies staring out the window, licking himself".
What?
"He's become so subservient lately that when he finishes grooming himself, he often begins licking Frasier".
I have no memory of that.
"April 14th, the day I've dreaded for weeks.
Frasier died this morning.
I never would've guessed that my heart could ache so over the death of my beloved lab rat.
My only consolation is the knowledge that I will soon give birth to my first child".
Frasier do you know what this means?
Our mother named us after rodents.
No, it means I have ended my marriage to the woman I love based on the case history of a spineless rat.
- Oh, my God.
- Niles.
Maris has seen the papers.
It's too late to take it back.
- Your reasoning was still sound.
- My reasoning?
My reasoning was based on my mother's obsession with vermin!
- What the hell's going on?
- Niles is just a bit distraught.
- Distraught?
My life is over!
Niles, don't talk that way.
My God, man, you've got to calm down.
All right, all right.
I'm gonna splash some cold water on my face.
- Right.
Right.
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I've never seen him like this.
Of course he'll be all right.
Niles, just remember to keep breathing.
And, trust me, this is not the end!
Your life is not over.
Niles.
Niles!
Oh, my God.
Dr Crane, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Just a little hot and foamy.
You know what must have happened?
My Hot 'n' Foamy must have exploded.
He was a detective, you know.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yes, Maris.
You are?
You do?
You will?
That's wonderful.
I'll be right over.
Goodbye.
The divorce papers were a bluff.
When I signed them, it completely threw her.
- She's willing to go into counselling.
- Niles, I'm so happy for you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, Ni
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Do you think Maris and I are meant to be together?
Oh, what's this?
- I got you a gift.
- You did?
What's the occasion?
- No reason.
You can't give something for no reason.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
You're starting to take the fun out of this.
But there's no reason for this.
- Does there have to be a reason?
- Yeah.
- Oh, would you just open it?
- Oh, jeez.
- I knitted it myself.
- Oh, gee You know, I had trouble with the rolled collar.
I'm surprised you didn't hear me cursing from my bedroom.
Boy, Daphne, this is really nice.
I wish I had something to give you.
- We're back on that again.
- All right, all right.
- But at least let me pay you for it.
- Pay me for it?
It's a gift.
Just a couple bucks for the yarn.
- Dad, has Niles called?
- No.
I've been standing out front for 20 minutes.
We're gonna be late for our squash court.
- Nice cardigan.
- Daphne surprised me with it.
You don't seem very happy about it.
I'm not.
I mean, you just don't give somebody something - for no reason.
That's my rule.
- Dad, spontaneous gift-giving is one of life's great pleasures.
Didn't you give Mom anything without warning?
Yeah, you.
Where do you think I got the rule from?
Oh, there you are.
Come on, Niles, let's shake a leg.
- We'll be late for our court time.
- Just a minute.
Of course I do, Maris.
Well, I miss you more.
- No, I do.
No, I do.
- Niles.
More than Van Cleef would miss Arpels.
Oh, no, I don't.
No, you have the prettier laugh.
No, you do.
No, you do.
I'm gonna go walk into the ocean.
Oh, no, I would love to meet you for lunch, but you know what Dr Deutsch said: No meetings outside our therapy sessions.
Oh, now, Maris Oh, wait, hold on a second.
It's my other line.
Hello.
Get the hell off the phone.
How rude.
Please.
You realize it's also rude to be late?
You're telling me about being late for an appointment?
You're ridiculously tardy.
Tardy, tardy.
No, I think  Forget it.
How dare you hang up on me.
Bunny?
Do you mind if we continue this conversation later?
Oh, I'll be counting the minutes too.
Well, I hope you're happy.
We have now officially lost our court.
Well, I'm sorry.
I would hope that my attempt to salvage my marriage would be more important than a squash game.
Of course.
I was just looking forward to playing.
I enjoy a morning game of squash more than anyone.
- No, I do.
- No, I do.
No, no, stop it.
Niles, I would love to see you and Maris reconcile, if that's what you want.
I'm just afraid you might be going a bit too quickly.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please.
Need I remind you last month she served you with divorce papers?
I'm aware of that.
We're not rushing into anything.
We only see each other at therapy.
That reminds me.
Yesterday at the cafë, I asked you a question, which you deftly avoided answering.
Do you think Maris and I are meant to be together?
Right.
Well That's a tough question.
Perhaps the better question would be, "Do you think you and Maris are meant to be together"?
I serve you up a question.
You clumsily bat it back to me.
We've hardly missed our squash game at all.
No, no, I'm really interested in your opinion.
- Let's say you were God.
- Niles, please, I don't wanna play God.
Please.
No, just play along.
Let's say you are the supreme ruler of heaven and earth.
- What would you do?
- Well, for starters, I'd issue a recall on some of my lesser species.
L I still want an answer to that question.
Hello?
What is it, pumpkin?
Oh, now, now Dear, calm down.
I'm sure that the banging you hear is just the pipes.
If a servant had been walled in during the remodelling, he'd have died weeks ago.
If it will ease your mind at all, why don't you have Marta take roll call?
- Hold on a second.
Hello?
- Get out.
Well, this is Dr Frasier Crane, saying goodbye and good mental health.
Your brother called.
Lord, he must really want an answer to that question.
No, he wanted to tell you the wine-club meeting was cancelled.
- What question?
- Yesterday, he asked me straight out if I thought he and Maris were meant for each other.
- That's a loaded question.
- Yeah, you're telling me.
I don't even know what my answer is.
Why don't you just play it safe and say yes?
In my experience, when someone asks that question, they're not looking for honesty, they're looking for reassurance.
- Tell him what he wants to hear.
- I don't know, Roz.
Trust me, Frasier.
It's like if I ask you, "Do I look fat in these pants"?
You're right.
There's only one way to answer that question.
What?
- Do you think I look fat in these?
- No, I don't.
- I work out.
It's the pleats, isn't it?
- Just stop it.
Get ahold of yourself.
I was thinking about what you had said.
I'm gonna tell Niles yes, I think he and Maris were meant to be together.
Who are you waving to?
Is that Elise Edmonds from Promotions?
- We got a little date tonight.
- A date?
And you didn't tell me?
It's no big deal.
I don't think she's interested.
- Hi, Frasier.
Hey, Roz.
FRASIER Hi.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to make sure.
- Am I still seeing you tonight?
- Yes, you are.
Which means, of course, that I'll be seeing you as well.
Great.
Bye.
Whoa!
That woman is totally into you.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"I'll see you later.
Great.
Bye".
- And that's a good sign?
- Hello.
She might as well have calf-roped you with her pantyhose.
This promises to be a very interesting evening.
- I think so.
- Well, she is very attractive.
Slender.
Gee, I wonder why your mind went there.
- Not this again, Roz.
- Of course.
She was next to me.
I hate these pants.
- I look like the Liberty Bell.
- The Liberty Bell  - Afternoon, Mr Crane.
- Hello.
- I've got the mail.
- Oh, thanks.
You wanna just put it on the table there?
Is this for me?
You know anybody else around here who uses eucalyptus bubble bath?
- Well, your son occasionally likes - Oh, never mind.
- This is lovely.
- Well, I'm glad you like it, because I picked it all out myself.
You know, I got you your fancy soaps, and your moisturizers, and this rock thing that scrapes all the dead skin off the bottom of your feet.
Well, if you're gonna nap on the couch, wear slippers.
- Still, Mr Crane, you really overdid it.
- No, I didn't.
- I don't know if I can accept this.
- Why not?
Because you spent far too much.
All right.
Well, then, I'll take a couple of things back.
Wait, not that one.
Daphne, would you please just take the damn basket?
What are you getting so cross about?
You can give me a gift, but I'm not allowed to give you one back?
- That's the reason you gave me this?
- Yeah, that's the way it works.
Where I come from, you don't give someone a gift because you have to.
Here, take your silly basket.
All right, fine.
Well, then, you can take your crappy old cardigan back too.
I don't know why you gave it to me in the first place.
- Because I like you.
- Well, I like you.
Than why can't you just accept my gift and be happy?
- I am happy.
I love that cardigan.
- And I love my damn basket.
- What is all this?
- We're exchanging our damn gifts.
Well, here.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Good Lord.
It's like Christmas morning in the Gambino household.
By the way, Niles called while you were in the shower to remind you about the squash tomorrow.
That's strange.
We just made that date this morning.
He must be champing at the bit to get an answer to that question.
What question?
Oh, he asked me if I thought he and Maris were meant to be together.
Well, if you ask me, you should keep your bazoo shut.
You're always getting in trouble opening that big bazoo of yours.
How wonderful, Dad.
We found a new word to strike from your vocabulary, along with patootie and bupkis.
You're gonna answer him, aren't you?
I think I have to.
But listen, I'm just gonna play it safe.
Tell him yes.
He's gonna do what he wants to anyway.
I don't know.
He takes your opinion pretty seriously.
Well, when we were younger, there was a certain sway I had over him, but Do you remember back in prep school when he was gonna try out for the track team?
I convinced him all the cool kids were gonna join the Madrigal Society?
I'm not just talking about school.
He's always come to you for career decisions too.
Where to do his residency, where to set up his practice.
Perhaps I have underestimated my influence.
You know, frankly, my opinion could be the single most important factor in his making this decision.
- I don't know if I'd go as far as that.
- Please, Dad.
You don't know what it's like to have your opinion matter.
Niles depends on me.
He deserves my true and honest answer.
- And what is that?
- Well Maris has always been spoiled and selfish and led him around by the nose.
I'd have to say my answer would be no.
Thank you, Dad.
I've changed my answer from a yes to a no.
There you go.
On the other hand  I knew it.
Well, no, you know, there are a lot of other factors here, Dad.
Niles does love Maris.
She has agreed to go into therapy, and Niles swears that she's a changed person.
L I don't know.
I guess if I really wanna know what's going on in Maris' mind, I've got to ask her myself.
- You agree with that, don't you, Dad?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Well, I've got a couple hours before my date.
So if I really wanna know what Maris is thinking, I will go directly to the source.
- Are you ready to order?
- Well, not quite yet.
I'm still waiting on someone.
Oh, there she is now.
Marta.
Marta, I can't tell you how nice it is to see you again.
My pleasure.
And this coffee is too, too divine.
I see your English lessons with Maris are progressing nicely.
Yes.
She teaching me many words.
That coat is so dëclassë.
Listen, Marta, I'm gonna come right to my point.
Dr Crane and Maris Missy Crane.
- Have been seeing a couples' therapist lately, - and I understand it's going very well.
- Therapy helping Missy Crane a lot.
Really?
So you would say that she's a changed person?
Si, si.
Missy Crane very different, nicer to everyone.
And this time no happy pills.
For my birthday, she gave me beautiful Chanel makeup bag.
It's a knockoff, but it's big.
Oh, all right then, this is my question: If Dr Crane and Mrs Crane were to get back together again, do you?
Do you think that Mrs Crane would treat Dr Crane better?
Oh, yes.
Please ask Dr Crane to come home.
Marta, you've been most helpful.
You know, lately, I've been wondering if Niles and Maris ought to be together.
And now, thanks to you, I know that the answer to that question is yes.
What?
Did I say something funny?
No, my beeper on vibrate.
It tickle me.
Sorry.
I have to go.
Missy Crane need me.
- Oh, thanks, all right.
I understand.
- Thanks for cafe.
Call me.
Mean it.
Well, there is a limit.
- Hey.
- Oh, Daphne.
Was that Mrs Crane's Marta who was just leaving?
It was.
We were just sharing a coffee.
Marta helped allay my fears about Niles and Maris getting back together.
Yes, I think she'd be glad to see Dr Crane back in that household.
- I should go get my beans.
- Wait, Daphne.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm sure Dr Crane acts as a good buffer between Mrs Crane and the help.
Gee, it never occurred to me that Marta might have an ulterior motive.
Who could blame her?
Mrs Crane can be a bit demanding.
Well, then, this taints Marta's entire testimony.
Is it possible she could have lied to me?
No.
With my trained eye, very few things can escape my notice, as I'm sure you've observed, Daphne.
You think that l?
But could she have lied to me?
You know, see, this is the predicament I'm in.
Every time someone gives me a valid argument, somebody else comes along, gives me a perfectly valid counterargument.
One minute I think the answer is yes, the next minute I think it's no.
This is driving me crazy.
No, I've got to stick with it.
Niles asked me what I think That's it.
What I think.
I don't know what I think right now.
But that's where I should focus.
Don't you agree?
Oh, yes, absolutely.
Oh, I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Is everything all right, Frasier?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I'm just a little preoccupied.
Stop obsessing.
Enjoy the date.
Here we are.
So where are we going?
I've chosen a little Italian place I know, if that's all right.
- I trust your judgement.
- Okay.
But then, who doesn't?
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I told myself I wasn't gonna bring this up to you.
I don't really think it's appropriate for a first date, but I haven't been able to think about anything else all day, so here goes.
Do you think it's possible for two people to be meant for each other?
- You've thought about that all day?
- Yes.
- Well, yes, I do.
- I do too.
But how do you know that they're meant for each other?
Of course, it's essential that they have similar interests, goals in common.
- Don't forget physical attraction.
- Oh, well, that's a given.
Yeah.
But you know, my ex-wife and I had all those things, and our marriage was an unmitigated disaster.
She probably just didn't appreciate you.
No, not entirely.
Did she listen to your show every day, sometimes even tape it so she could listen to it in bed at night?
I didn't have a show then.
I guess what it comes down to is What is that special something that makes us cry out, "Yes, we are meant to be together"?
Who knows?
All that matters is that we both feel it.
Hmm?
I would've told you months ago how I felt, but I was too insecure.
I never dreamed you felt the same way I did.
Frasier, don't turn shy on me now.
What you thinking?
Elise, I'm I'm thinking you are quite the practical joker.
Pretending not to know I was talking about my brother Niles and his wife.
Surely Roz must have told you.
Oh, yeah.
Sense of humour.
That's another thing that's important to have in common.
Frasier, I have a headache.
I'm gonna take a rain check on tonight, okay?
Oh, no, Elise.
Listen, please, we can still go out.
Pretend none of this ever happened.
- Perfect.
- Oh, don't Elise, please don't I can't for the life of me figure out why this decision is causing me so much anxiety.
There's just so many things to be considered, you know.
On one hand, well, perhaps I'm afraid that if Niles and Maris reconcile, we may lose the friendship he and I developed during their separation.
On the other hand, if Maris does take him back, well, then, I won't have to feel so responsible for him.
Ah, there's just so much at stake.
Oh, not that kind of steak.
Stop it.
You know, you're driving me crazy.
I just can't think here.
I'm gonna go take a walk.
What?
Oh, not with you.
Go away.
Time for your bath.
So gullible.
Tell him what he wants to hear.
He takes your opinion pretty seriously.
Missy Crane very different, nicer to everyone.
Bazoo, shut your bazoo.
Fat, fat, fat, fat.
Dr Crane makes a good buffer.
- Who's there?
It's Frasier.
Let me in.
- How did you get up here?
- The doorman was asleep.
- Well, what a coincidence, so was I. - I'm sorry, Niles.
- I apologize for the late hour.
- Well, what's wrong?
- You smell of the streets.
- Well, l I've been wandering Seattle in search for an answer to your question.
I know how crucial my opinion is.
I didn't wanna take your question lightly.
What question?
You asked if I thought that you and Maris were meant for each other.
Oh, right.
I've been to hell and back agonizing over this question, and you forgot.
No, I didn't forget.
I'm sorry, Frasier, I'm groggy.
Come in, come in.
I'm touched that you've given it this much thought.
- You're a good brother.
- Thank you.
So please.
Well, this This is hard for me to say, but No.
I don't think you and Maris are meant to be together.
I believe that a marriage should be built on a foundation of friendship and mutual respect.
With Maris, I fear that you'll never experience those things fully.
And I question whether you'll ever be truly happy.
I see.
Well, thank you.
- You're hurt, aren't you?
- No, no, I I just need some time to process this.
I appreciate your stopping by.
It's just one of those times when I need to be alone.
- Did you just hear a bell?
- No.
Why don't you come on, go home, get some rest  - There it is again.
- No, I don't think so.
Wait a minute.
Oh, Niles Maris is here, isn't she?
How could you?
Well, she offered, and I said yes.
How could you do this without waiting for my opinion?
Well, someone certainly has a high opinion of his opinion.
Why don't you just go run back to her before she sprains her wrist?
Oh, no Frasier.
Frasier.
I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.
Maris has changed.
She now understands that she cannot control me.
I am my own man.
I don't actually respond to that.
It's a little joke we have between us.
Okay, that means business.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Oh, Roz, listen, I managed to get some reservations to San Gennaro's tonight.
Thought we'd go celebrate your birthday.
Oh, that is so sweet, but I have a date with that waiter we met at lunch yesterday.
- You're going out with that guy?
- I didn't have enough for a tip.
Keep in mind the service wasn't that good.
The reservation won't go to waste.
I can always take Niles.
Niles?
Again?
You know, your entire social life consists of going out with your brother.
Don't you think you're getting into kind of a rut?
You're still young.
You need to go out and get drunk, wake up in a stranger's bed, not even remember how you got there.
In other words, exchange my rut for yours.
Well, do what you want, but you know what, you could shake up your life every once in a while.
Do something spur of the moment.
Once, I finished work on a Friday and hopped a plane to Acapulco, and I didn't pack anything but my toothbrush.
I dimly recall you calling in sick one Monday morning with a mariachi band in the background.
- Well, I was sick.
- Uh-huh.
Hey, Dr Crane.
- Daphne.
I'm glad you're here.
My zip's stuck.
Well good thing I got here when I did.
Don't be afraid to grab hold and give it all you've got.
Okay.
Yeah, sometimes pulling it down a bit helps.
Okay.
Oh, dear.
I've zipped my tie into your dress.
- It won't come loose.
- Oh, let me see.
Well I'm sorry.
- It is stuck, isn't it?
- Yes, strange.
Oh, maybe some liquid soap from the powder room will help loosen it up.
Niles there's something on your tie.
Dr Crane was helping me with my dress, and now he's caught.
Yes, he is.
- Here, allow me.
Be careful.
There.
All right.
Now.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
Oh, what a relief.
I was just about to step right out of this dress and embarrass poor Dr Crane to death.
Well, we all have to die of something.
Oh, Niles, I managed to score some reservations tonight at San Gennaro.
- You up for a little Italian?
- Actually, I'm going out with Maris.
So I guess you could say I'm up for a little Episcopalian.
That's good.
- Like some sherry?
- Yes, thank you.
So, it seems your counselling sessions must be going very well.
They are.
So tonight we thought it would be a kick to recreate our very first date.
That's sweet.
Hey, Dad.
In fact, that day, my car was in the shop, so I'm here to borrow Dad's car just like I did back then.
Just saying that makes me feel so young.
"Gee, Dad, can I borrow the car"?
You did that twice on the phone, and I didn't find it cute then.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I just can't picture Maris in Dad's '82 lmpala.
Neither could she at first.
I'll never forget the look of wonder on her face - at touching vinyl for the first time.
- Ah.
She said it made her feel cheap and dirty.
And she liked it.
- I was her first bad boy.
Uh -huh.
Yes, I remember the way you used to carry her inhaler around rolled up in the sleeve of your T-shirt.
Well, how about you two?
You guys wanna join me for dinner tonight?
Oh, sorry.
Sherry's cooking me dinner tonight.
And I have a date with Greg.
- Greg?
I don't believe I've met him yet.
- I have.
He's gorgeous.
Well, he is.
Certainly the best-looking man I've ever been out with.
Of course, he doesn't have a thought in that pretty little head of his.
Oh, this could be the one.
Well, you know, maybe I can have Sherry cook for me some other time.
Oh, no need to put yourself out on my account, Dad.
Oh, Dad, did you happen to check this message?
No, I don't touch that thing.
Hi, it's Laura.
We're getting an extra day of rehearsal, so I'm coming in tonight instead of tomorrow.
American, flight 11, - Bye.
- Great news.
- Laura's in town.
- Who's Laura?
Stranger who called my machine by mistake.
Here it is, table for two, Dr Frasier Crane.
- From the radio, yes?
- Yes, yes.
Oh, you know, actually my date cancelled, so it'll just be me.
I see, sir.
Table for one.
Well, there is no need to lower your voice.
I'm not ashamed to dine alone.
Perhaps, as a man of some celebrity, I can serve as a symbol to others who might otherwise be afraid to do so.
I mean, really, in some cases it's actually preferable to sit and dine alone rather than listen to someone too much in love with his own voice prattle on endlessly.
Well, you've convinced me, sir.
I'll see if your table's ready.
Dr Crane, your table for one is ready.
Listen, is it possible for me to have a table elsewhere?
I mean, I feel just a bit conspicuous right here.
I'm very sorry, sir, but they're all reserved.
But don't worry, most of our patrons only have eyes for each other.
Very well.
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely.
Perhaps I could have a glass of your house cabernet.
Very good, sir.
Hi.
Hello.
What's your name?
Johnny.
How come nobody's sitting with you?
Well, that's a bit complicated, Johnny.
My mom and dad said it's okay if you come sit with us.
Well, that's a very, very sweet offer.
Look, I know it's hard for a young boy to understand, but, you know, really there's nothing wrong with someone eating by himself.
You know, one time I was really bad at school, and the teacher made me eat lunch all by myself.
Oh, I'll bet that gave you an opportunity to think about your actions, didn't it?
No, I just cried.
Run along, Johnny.
- Your glass of cabernet, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, and I see your candle has gone out.
- Enrico!
- Please, stop, stop, stop.
Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
Excuse me.
Are you here by yourself?
As a matter of fact, I am, yes.
I was hoping you'd say that.
- Would you mind if l?
- Oh, good Lord, yes.
I've been sitting here actually hoping someone would make good use of that chair.
Thank you.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Oh, of course I'll marry you!
Sorry for the commotion, folks.
Oh, gosh, is that our fault?
Listen, let me pay for the dry cleaning.
Not to worry.
Not to worry.
- Congratulations, you two.
Here's to young love.
Well, as long as we're all sharing good news, my wife just told me that we're having twins.
Now that I've already interrupted all of your meals, I'd just like to share my joy with everyone here.
To Amanda, my future bride.
I will love you every day of my life.
And I hope that when we die, it's at the exact same moment so that neither one of us will ever have to spend even one second alone again.
Oh.
Hi.
Johnny said I could eat with you.
Hey, Fras, how was your dinner?
Not since Quasimodo strolled the streets of medieval Paris have so many people uttered the phrase, "That poor man".
I'm sure it wasn't as bad as all that.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
The highlight of the evening came when the entire staff of waiters delivered the birthday cake that I had ordered for Roz and neglected to cancel.
They sang to me.
It's not your birthday.
Staying right up with the story as usual, Dad.
Anyway, after dinner I took a long stroll.
It suddenly struck me: I'm single.
You know, I had gotten accustomed to thinking of myself as recently divorced, but that was five years ago.
I'm 43, and I'm alone.
Hey.
I got something that'll cheer you up.
I brought you some of Sherry's mock apple pie.
It's called mock because they use crackers instead of apples.
Oh, good.
Nothing spoils an apple pie like apples.
- Oh, Niles.
- Frasier.
Oh, what happened?
Oh, no, let me guess.
Robust color, fruity bouquet.
I'd say that's an amusing little merlot.
- Cabernet.
- Well, it's still amusing.
So did you and Mrs Crane enjoy recreating your first date?
Oh, yes.
My Maris remembered details that I'd forgotten.
For example, when I brought her home after the restaurant, we took a stroll around the grounds.
Suddenly, Marta appeared on the balcony playing the part of Maris' late father.
She was liquored up on Rob Roys, and firing Swedish meatballs at me from an antique blunderbuss.
Dad, am I the only one in this household that checks this machine?
Hi, Molly.
Laura again.
Again.
Is that Tom on the machine?
He sounds nice.
Anyway, I just called to remind you I'll have my cello with me.
Translation, you might wanna clean out your car this time to make room.
I know, toujours la grande soeur.
Anyway, I can't wait to see you guys.
I've been on my own way too much lately.
See you at 10:30, flight 11.
Love you.
Bye.
It's too bad there's no way to call her back.
She's gonna be stranded at the airport.
Oh, don't worry.
She'll take a cab.
You know, that happens a lot, people leaving wrong messages.
After hearing a stranger's voice like that, it always starts me wondering what they must be like.
You can't judge what a person's like just from a voice.
That's true.
I was once told that I sounded, imagine the impertinence, uptight.
And me, you'd picture some cranky old geezer.
I've lost track of what point we're making.
Well, she sounds to me like a very interesting woman.
- Intelligent.
- She speaks French.
Yeah.
I always loved the name Laura.
You know, that was gonna be your name if you were a girl.
- Really?
Yeah.
Your mother always wanted Priscilla, but I never like the nickname Prissy.
I never much cared for it either.
You know, Dr Crane, this Laura sounds like she might just be a perfect match for you.
If you left now, you could meet that plane.
Honestly, Daphne.
A couple of phone calls, you're fixing us up.
Well, think about it.
She plays the cello.
You'd like that.
- She appreciates neatness.
- Yeah.
She expresses affection easily.
That's good.
Well, pardon me for growing a little, okay?
She did mention being on her own too much, so we know she's available.
It's fun to speculate, but, come on, you can't seriously be suggesting  Well, why not?
I can't imagine a more exciting way to meet.
The woman of your dreams steps off a plane and there you are to rescue her.
Oh, yeah, you can't beat meeting somebody in a romantic way.
That's the way it was with me and your mom.
You met Mother over the chalk outline of a murder victim.
So?
It was romantic to us.
Every wonder why on our anniversary she'd make those gingerbread cookies with the legs kind of bent and the head kind of crooked?
We thought they were dancing.
I met a boy in a cute way once.
I was 18 and visiting Stonehenge.
This dashing young man came up to me and told me he was an actual descendant of the Druids.
Boy, is that the one place that line would work.
I met someone once flying home from college.
I got bumped into first class, found myself sitting next to a positively ravishing woman.
She was older, and I was trying desperately to be suave, so when she leaned over and suggested we join the mile high club, rather than admit I was unfamiliar with the term, I whispered back, "I really don't travel enough to make that worthwhile".
God, that was No.
Still can't laugh about it.
Hi, Molly.
Laura again.
Is that Tom on the machine?
He sounds nice.
Anyway She liked the sound of my voice.
She's called me twice today.
That's already the best relationship I've had this year.
So are you going?
Maybe.
Oh, I don't know.
There's nothing worse than when you look back on a missed opportunity.
- What the hell.
- Oh, this is so exciting.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Before you go  Stop right there.
Don't say another word to me.
I won't do anything this impulsive if I over think it.
Just let me get the hell out of here before I change my mind.
But not before I change my shirt.
Thanks for all your help.
I can take it from here.
- Laura?
Looking for Molly?
- Yes, I am.
- Molly sent a driver?
- Oh, no, no.
I'm not a driver.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm here to help you.
- Molly's having me committed?
- No, no.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
- Oh, from the radio.
- Yes.
- You know me?
- Yes, I've heard your show.
It's great.
But your knowing me is just weird.
Actually, you left a couple of messages on my machine today by mistake.
Oh, no.
I must've gotten my sister's new number wrong.
Well, I didn't want you waiting around for someone who wasn't coming.
So you came all the way down here?
What are you, like, the nicest guy in the world?
Yes, yes, I am.
Well, speaking of nice, I would be delighted to drive you to your sister's home.
Oh, no, no, no, I'll take a cab.
- Are you sure?
It's no trouble at all.
- She lives an hour away.
But, listen, could I buy you a drink just to say thank you?
Well, yes, I'd love that.
May I take your cello?
I checked my cello.
This is my purse.
I think that's funny.
Why doesn't anybody laugh at that?
That is funny.
Allow me.
So are you with an orchestra?
With a chamber music group, actually.
We're based in L.A., but we travel quite a bit.
I grew up here, so it's always nice to come back.
I miss it.
So, what'll you have?
I think I'll have a glass of sherry.
Two.
Not that you can expect that much from airport-bar sherry.
Oh, goodness, don't I sound like the perfect snob?
Yes.
I mean I agree with you about the sherry.
So why did you choose the cello?
When I was around 11, my father took me to the symphony.
And this sounds a little silly, but when I heard the cello, it sounded sad, like it needed me.
That's not silly.
That's lovely.
I was always an odd kid.
All my girlfriends had posters of David Cassidy.
I had Pablo Casals.
I had Sigmund Freud.
But did you kiss him before you went to bed?
Well, I was tempted to but he just would've read too much into it.
Oh, here, thank you.
I don't believe I've ever shared a drink with a psychiatrist.
I'm worried that you must be analyzing me.
Well, if I am, my diagnosis so far is that I I can't find a single thing wrong with you.
- Actually, it's quite good.
- Yes.
My second pleasant surprise this evening.
Frasier, maybe I'm misreading you here, but I'm married.
Oh.
See, I don't know why I jumped to the conclusion that you were single.
Wasn't there something in your message about having been on your own too much lately?
- Oh, I've been away on tour.
- Oh.
Well, I guess by now you've probably figured out that my coming down here wasn't entirely the act of a Good Samaritan.
More like a lonely Samaritan.
I guess that makes me seem sort of desperate.
No, I think it makes you seem sort of romantic.
I used to do things like this when I was single.
It was fun.
Clearly you were better at being single than I am.
Oh, come on.
Let me ask you a question.
How did you feel coming down here?
I felt completely exhilarated.
In fact, it's the most fun I've had in recent memory.
Exactly.
The anticipation.
The excitement.
The hope.
Marriage is the death of all that.
I hope you didn't write your own vows.
I'm not down on marriage.
It's just marriage can be great, but so can not being married.
I suppose.
Well, you're, you're smart, lovely, talented, able to look at the bright side of things.
I'm getting more disappointed by the moment.
I'm sorry it didn't turn out the way you wanted.
Oh, don't be.
