{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hello?
Donna, it's you!
How's California?
Have you run into Johnny Carson yet?
No.
I read he won't eat corn.
What?
Oh, Eric.
Oh.
No.
No.
I know he wants to talk to you.
He hasn't heard from you all summer.
I'll get him.
Eric!
Ow!
Eric.
Eric, are you in the bathroom?
Yes.
- Well, get off, because- - Mom?
Mom.
When this door is closed, it's my sacred alone time.
Okay?
Think of it as church.
- But, I- - Mom.
!
Fine.
Gets up at noon, sits on the toilet until dinner- What kind of summer is that?
Well, you made me lose my concentration.
Now I'm gonna have to go back there in about an hour.
I just wanted to tell you Donna called.
Her number's on the pad by the kitchen phone.
What?
Why wouldn't you say something?
And I'm staying out of this, but if you'd eat a little bran you could've taken that call yourself.
- Where's the notepad?
- Here.
Quit twitchin'.
What?
There's no number.
Dad.
Step away from the vehicle.
Isn't it a little early for you to be hopped up?
- Empty your pockets, now.
- Get the hell out of my pants!
Got it.
What the hell is wrong with him?
He has low self-esteem because you are too domineering.
Red, you're gonna let Forman get away with that, man?
He just felt you up.
Where's the foot in the ass?
- Unless you're getting too old.
- Shut it.
And go shave that thing.
You look like a damn Hungarian.
-  - It's ringing.
-  It's ringing.
- Oh, my God, it's ringing.
And Eric chickens out again.
Quack, quack, quack.
Forman, what's the problem?
It's just- I want to tell her to come home, that I miss her that I love her.
I mean, it's too much to say over the phone.
Look, Eric, just write her a letter.
That's how I broke up with Michael.
Yeah.
I was able to take my time and come up with good synonyms for ''cowardly, won't-marry-me loser run-away-to-California jackass.
'' Jackie, I'm charismatic in person.
I've got these awesome hand gestures.
And, uh, I kind of, like, waggle my eyebrows when I talk.
Wait.
You do that on purpose?
Thanks, you guys.
That's-That's helpful.
You know what?
That's it.
I'm going.
I'll just show up in California and, like, blow her mind.
Yeah.
I mean when the Empire killed Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle, did he just call 'em up?
- Oh, God.
- Oh.
No.
He hopped on the Millennium Falcon and he paid a little visit to the Death Star.
Wait a minute.
Do chickens go quack, or did I mess that up?
I sat at my mom's house for three hours.
Eric still hasn't called.
Hey, you know what might make you feel better?
Playing pinball over there.
I don't have any quarters.
Hey, Kelso.
You know what might help me?
If you could tell me how you got overJackie.
You rememberJackie, don't you?
- Who's Jackie?
- Uh Jackie was my dog.
She died in a Big Wheel accident.
No, Annette.
I meantJackie, his ex-girlfriend.
Uh, also dead.
- She's not dead.
- What's going on here?
- Why are you lying to me?
- No, no.
I'm not lying,Jackie- Annette.
Look, baby.
Well, my work here is done.
You want to go to California to get Donna?
You can't go to California.
But I have to tell Donna I love her and that she should be back here with me.
Oh.
Well, that's sweet.
I think it would sound especially good on the phone.
But don't call till after 7:00 when the rates go down.
Well, I can't call her.
I mean - did Luke Skywalker- - Oh.
Would you stop.
Luke Skywalker this.
Luke Skywalker that.
I'm sick of hearing about that little fruit.
Luke Skywalker is not- He and Leia clearly- I- Mom, Dad.
- This is important.
-  No.
No California.
You know what's important?
School.
You're gonna be a senior, and you need to buckle down.
Luke Skywalker would've buckled down.
Forman, there's a flight to California in four hours, and you're on it.
Before you get all gushy, we didn't pay for it.
We stole the money from your secret stash in the Scooby-Doo thermos.
You guys know about Scooby-Doo?
It was a good try, but you should have known that eventually I would need to take some cocoa on the go.
Well, thanks, you guys but my parents will kill me.
- No, Eric.
We'll cover for you.
- Yeah.
Believe me.
I got no problem foolin' whitey.
Hyde, you're white.
Barely.
Eric, if you love her, you have to go.
You're right.
I'm gonna do this.
Damn it, I'm goin'.
I gotta go pack.
Hey, let me help.
I love putting together outfits.
- Finally.
- Yeah.
I thought they'd never leave.
You know, Steven, it was really nice of you to get that ticket for Eric.
This usually works a whole lot better when you don't talk.
Look, Annette.
You're way more important to me than Jackie ever was.
I mean, you're blonde.
You're beautiful.
You practically never wear a whole shirt.
I'm sorry.
It's just the thought of you with somebody else got me really upset.
I'm really upset.
Which is why I propose that we do something special and romantic.
Let's do it.
Michael, I don't do that.
- I'm a virgin.
- What?
A coincidence.
Me too.
So let's do it.
First-timers, yeah.
You know what?
I'm gonna go cool off.
- Kelso- - Ah-ah, one second.
She's coolin' off.
Look.
I was wondering if you and Annette could maybe discuss your plans to do it or not do it when I'm not around.
But you're never not around.
You're always here.
You're like a carbuncle.
Kelso, you don't even know what a carbuncle is.
Well, I know it's gross, and it doesn't go away.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
It's just I don't know anybody else.
California people are freaks.
Like that guy.
You can't smoke that out here!
I miss Eric.
That guy even looks like Eric.
Oh, my God.
Eric!
Donna!
Kelso, what the hell are you doing?
Winning.
I oughta- I- I can't believe you came here for me.
Of course I did.
Donna, I love you.
And I have so much to say, but I- You guys can French all you want.
I totally won.
- Hey, Red.
- Good day, Mr. Red.
Wait a minute.
Where's the other idiot?
Other idiot?
Do we know another idiot?
- Where's Eric?
- Where's Eric?
Where are you, man, and who wants to know?
The U.S. government, that's who.
Like, I read by 1 984, the government will have tracking devices on all of us.
And after that, they're gonna jam electrodes in our brains so they can read our memories.
Damn U.S. government.
''Damn U.S. government''?
Without our government, you'd be stuck in Siberia now suckin' the juice from a rotten commie potato.
Let me tell you something.
If the U.S. government decides to stick a tracking device up your ass you say, ''Thank you and God bless America.
'' He's so easy.
And then after Michael threw up, I told him ''You're not supposed to eat the plastic wrapping.
'' And that's how we met.
Wow.
That's- That's like Love Story.
Wow.
I wish there was more to talk about.
Bye.
Would you look at her.
She's so hot, she could be a robot.
''A robot''?
Whatever.
Look.
You have the van, and we want to go home.
No.
Uh-uh.
I can't leave Annette.
I love her.
You don't love her.
I love parts of her.
I mean, unlikeJackie, she believes in me.
Okay.
I told Annette I wanted to be an astronaut and she said that she thought I could.
To be fair, she wants to be a lady astronaut.
I mean, come on, guys.
Just give me a few hours.
Okay?
If- Look.
This girl is beautiful, and she believes in me.
And if I can get her to put out, she'll be three out of three.
Right now, she's only two out of three.
And I'm sorry, but 50% just ain't gonna cut it.
Okay.
Look, Steven.
These last few weeks with you have been really dirty and really wrong.
Jackie, talking is for people who have something in common.
Oh, good God.
You kids switch partners more than square dancers.
Uh, no.
It's not what you think.
We're not together.
Then what's going on in my kitchen?
Um Eric's in California.
Jackie, you just totally burned Forman.
That was so badass.
So, Annette, I'm just saying that I'm leaving in a couple hours.
So I guess the question is what, oh, what can two virgins do to kill an afternoon?
Well, there is something.
But it's kind of wet and dirty.
Sold!
Having fun?
No.
I mean, these are our last hours together and you're not nude.
So all you care about is sex?
I thought there was more to you than that.
But there isn't.
But there is.
I believe in you.
- Stop saying that.
- But I do.
Damn.
All right.
Start digging the moat.
I was so scared that I'd never feel like this with you again.
I mean Eric, after last year- - Donna.
- I- About Casey and all that stuff?
I don't care.
Okay?
I just want to be with you.
You know, all summer I hated California.
But now that you're here, it's, like, amazing.
This is the most romantic night of my whole life.
Yeah, I know.
Me too.
I have sand in my crack.
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh.
Eric, I want to go home.
Hey, Kelso.
How was your date with Annette?
We went to a carnival.
I won her six stuffed animals.
Then we shared a giant pretzel.
And then I walked her home, and she gave me a good-night kiss on the cheek.
You know, in Wisconsin if you win a girl a giant purple rhinoceros she puts out!
So, my folks have no idea I was gone.
- No idea.
You're golden.
- Ah.
- Oh.
Hyde!
- Hey.
You got a beard!
You look so old.
Of course I look old, man.
Party more than you.
Work more, drank more, and slept with way more chicks.
I'm exhausted, man.
Fez, my little man!
How was your summer?
Well, I saw a boob and a half down by the pool.
Yeah.
Pool boob.
Nice.
Look.
Donna, I know you're nervous about seeing people at school after running away and all but I want you to know it's all under control.
I told everyone you went away to have a baby.
- What?
- Yeah.
It was badass.
Oh, yeah.
I say badass now.
Hi, Daddy.
Don't you ''Daddy'' me.
Although it does sound good to hear those words again.
- Bob.
- Right.
You're in big trouble, young lady.
Now get home now.
Move.
Well I guess that's what happens when you, uh, disobey your parents, huh?
Hey, why the long faces?
Did you think that I- No, no.
Funny story.
True story.
I'm walkin' home from the library and who should drive by?
Kelso and Donna.
Back from California.
Where they were.
Not me.
Oh, hey?
They know.
What do you have to say for yourself?
I- I brought you a seashell.
Just get in the house.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
Oh, yeah.
And it was worth it.
-  - Oh, not this again.
I told you, it gives me needs.
Fine.
We'll be upstairs.
Too late.
- Why are we watching this?
It's stupid.
- You're stupid.
Man, I've been gone all summer and I get back, and everything is just the same.
I guess nothing ever changes around here.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Of all the dumb-ass stunts you kids ever pulled this little California adventure takes the dumb-ass cake!
We are very disappointed in you, Eric.
Even though going to California to rescue Donna is one of the most romantic things I've ever heard of.
That's true.
If he had gone by horse, they would have made it a movie.
Look, Mr. Forman before you get all scary and pink I just want to say that running away to California was completely selfish and immature.
And, as for me, as long as I live under your roof and eat your food I should be doing things your way.
What a load of crap!
You two are not above the law.
Now, Eric, hand over the keys to the Vista Cruiser.
What?
Dad, no.
The Cruiser's my Batmobile.
Without it, I'm just a guy in a silly outfit.
Now, Eric.
A little time apart will do you kids some good.
So, Donna, I transferred you to the Catholic high school- Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.
- What?
- That's right.
You're starting this week so you better get out your Bible and brush up on your Ten Commandments and that thing about the dwarfs.
- What the hell?
- Fez!
Wait a second.
You two look sweaty and guilty.
Have you been eating my candy?
- What candy?
- I didn't say ''candy.
'' And I certainly don't have any candy hidden in the garage.
I will be in the garage.
Oh, God.
Steven, that was way too close.
You need to learn to keep your hands off me.
Me?
You're the one who can't keep her tongue to herself.
Please.
I let you fool around with me out of pity.
You know what your problem is?
You're really cute so no one ever told you to shut your piehole.
You think I'm cute?
Shut your piehole!
-  -   Oh, Catholic school?
That's rough.
- Yeah, my dad took away my slingshot- -  so I'm feeling it pretty bad too.
What were you guys doing?
Uh, we're just watching, uh- This old lady's eatin' a fish.
Look,Jackie we've been avoiding each other.
I think it's time we hash this thing out.
It's okay.
I'm good.
I can see you're devastated over losing me.
You know what, Michael?
I'm fine.
Really.
You sound brave.
But inside you're a scrambled mess.
Just remember this.
I'll always be there for you in case you have any physical needs, all right?
Damn, Hyde.
What was that for?
I just missed you, man.
Wait.
Donna, you're actually gonna go to Catholic school?
Not just Catholic school- Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.
That means ''sad forever.
'' Eric, we're never even gonna see each other.
Yeah, I know.
And I can't even drive you to school.
And we can forget about any lunchtime hokey-pokey.
Man, it sucks not having a car.
Well, I'm gonna go drive mine.
- Catch you guys later.
- Wait, wait, Steven.
Where are you going?
- What do you care?
- I don't.
-  - Um you know, I just remembered that I have to go to the mall because they're having this big Monday Madness sale.
Jackie?
It's Tuesday.
See?
Total madness!
Poor kid, trying to replace me with shopping.
Eric, what are we gonna do?
I mean, if I go to this school, our senior year is ruined.
I mean, we're not even gonna graduate together.
You know what?
Bob is not sending you to that Catholic school.
Now we're gonna sit down, we're gonna figure out what we're gonna do.
Guys?
Let's get serious.
It's simple.
I'm gonna march over there and talk to Bob.
I love a good march.
My birthday is in March.
And then it's on to April.
April showers.
Oh!
The Seduction of Eric Forman starring in the insatiable April Showers.
Are you really gonna go talk to my dad for me?
Eric, you're so sweet and brave.
Pound for pound, you're like the bravest guy in the whole world.
I love you so much!
Well, my candy is safe.
But something was up with Jackie.
She looked scared- like a deer in the headlights with his pants down.
Man, I feel sorry forJackie.
I mean, to have to look at this all day and not be able to touch it?
I can't even do that!
- I love you.
- I love you more.
Sexy.
Hey!
You two quit it!
Okay?
This circle is sacred.
You don't do anything in here that you wouldn't do in a church!
No, wait.
In a cemetery.
Wait.
In the teachers' lounge.
Man, I've done it everywhere.
-  - Okay.
This is my Michael box.
I saved everything that loser ever gave me.
Hmm.
One-year anniversary.
What a moron!
Well, you know, I guess Kelso's really history for you.
I never thought that'd happen till you met someone else.
You met someone else!
What?
Someone else?
That's crazy!
You're crazy.
Shut your piehole!
-  - Hey, check it out.
I was at the bakery, and this crumb cake came fresh out of the oven.
And when I think crumb cake, I think Bob.
Uh-huh.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you about Donna and that Catholic school.
Crumb cake isn't gonna get me to change my mind.
Are you sure?
Those are real crumbs.
She's going to that school, and that's final.
Okay.
Fine.
But know this.
I am prepared to fight this with every fiber of my being.
On the other hand you-you can't put a price on a good education.
I can't believe they're making you wear those knee-high socks every day.
-  -  What the hell?
Oh, my God!
I'm blind!
-Jackie!
- Get off me!
Great outfit!
Okay, so, um, what exactly did you see?
Hands, tongues.
Yours, his.
It was horrible!
You were like Siamese twins joined at the beard.
Hey, it was her fault, man.
She threw herself at me.
No, no.
You were on top of me.
You pulled me.
I've done a lot of partying, so, you know my balance is off.
This is impossible.
You two hate each other.
- Kelso is gonna freak out!
-  Kelso!
Settle down, Esmeralda.
Kelso doesn't need to know about this.
Yeah, look, it's just a meaningless fling, okay?
We can stop whenever we want.
- Well, then maybe you should.
- Why do you even care?
Because you're breaking up the band, Yoko!
Well, naughty ladies wear plaid.
Fez, please.
That's right.
Beg for it, sexy schoolgirl.
Fez, we just caught these two Frenching like a couple of French people at a Frenching festival.
What?
That's impossible.
You two hate each other.
I said- I just said that.
Okay, you are gonna tell us how this happened right now.
Ooh, I like it when you order me around in that uniform.
Okay, fine.
Look, I'll just tell you what happened.
It was a few weeks after Donna and Michael left and Steven invited me over to listen to a new record.
I'm glad you're here.
Check it out.
Isn't it the coolest?
Don't you just wanna shake it?
-  -  Wait.
Time out on the fiield.
I don't shake it, and I don't listen to ABBA.
Whatever.
It's my story.
Anyway-   I could totally tell he was trying to make a move.
Then he held me real close and said- May I kiss you, milady?
Hyde, I had no idea you could be so formal.
Come on.
She's so full of crap.
Then why don't you tell us what really happened, milady?
Fine.
Fine, okay?
So I'm hanging out in the basement like I usually do when Jackie showed up.
- It was obvious she wanted me.
- I want you.
That's obvious.
God, that's crazy.
No, you so came on to me first.
You said that you didn't have a new boyfriend.
- He is not my boyfriend.
- I'm not her boyfriend.
They just don't get it.
No.
Why would they?
Let's go, baby.
I'm leaving too.
This basement's tainted for me now.
Well, I still want to know how the hell all this happened.
-  -  Another old lady.
She can't even reach the wheel!
I can't watch The Price is Right again.
I just can't.
- God, the summer totally sucks.
-  - There's nothing to do.
-  -  -    I bid one dollar, Bob.
Hey.
I'm gonna take Donna to school.
Oh!
That's right.
Dad took away my car when I did that really super-romantic thing.
Well, I guess we were only reunited just to be ripped apart again.
Like Romeo and Juliet.
You know why don't you take the car this one time?
It'll be our little secret.
-  Okay.
-  Okay.
Shh!
Where do you think you're going?
Mom said I could.
-  - You just bought yourself another week, kiddo.
Look, Dad, I need my car.
Don't you remember when you were in high school?
I bet you had some good times driving around senior year with your friends.
My senior year, I was driving a gunboat around Okinawa.
And if you count theJapanese snipers as my friends then, yes, I had some good times.
You have to understand, Eric.
It's not that your father's trying to be a bad guy.
It's just that he's been irreparably damaged by war.
I'm just sick of you doing whatever the hell you want.
Your father and I feel that you're not taking yourself seriously.
- Hmm.
-  You are such a talented young man.
-  - Eric!
Oh.
Uh, yeah.
Forget about the car.
I gotta go.
Oh, look how cute in her little uniform.
!
I'm gonna have to lock him in his room and poke his eyes out.
-  - Here's what I don't get about Fantasy Island.
You know when you get off the plane, and you see Mr. Roarke and that little kid in the white suit?
Well, if it's me, I'm like, ''This is creepy,'' right?
So I just grab a free daiquiri and I'm out of there.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Grow up.
It's just a uniform.
- Sorry.
- You're right.
I'm sorry.
Oh!
Oh!
Man, that was totally worth waiting for.
- I agree.
Now we can go.
-  How was your first day?
Grim.
This nun totally spanked me with a ruler.
Yet another reason I wish I was a ruler.
- Wait a minute!
- Weird!
Okay.
Now you guys are sitting together?
Oh, my God.
You guys aren't just fooling around.
You care about her.
I do not.
She sickens me.
No.
No, no.
I'm the one who's sickened, okay?
I'm not supposed to be seen with scruffy guys like you.
I date guys I can take out in public.
Yet you continue with this abomination!
You know, you guys have to tell Kelso.
Or we'll tell Kelso.
Shall we?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Okay, guys.
Look.
What if we just break it off right now?
- Then he never has to know.
- Really?
Look, there's nothing to even break off, so it's fine by me.
Yes.
This is what I want to hear.
It'll be like it never happened.
Donna, come.
Let us leave this unholy thing behind.
Steven, do I really sicken you?
No.
I sicken me because you're supposed to sicken me, but you don't.
Well, I feel the same way.
I mean, I like how scruffy you are.
Of course you do.
Man, you know what?
Screw it.
Let's just do what we want, okay?
- Okay.
What about Michael?
- Details, baby.
Details.
So, uh, how's that uniform working out for you?
Stop!
Do you- Do you feel like a good girl that just can't help being bad?
Be bad, Donna.
I won't tell.
Eric, it's not funny.
I actually have to go to this school every day now.
Without-Without you.
Okay, so, you know what?
We'll see each other nights and weekends and I'll come visit you at school.
I mean, I still have a bike.
Eric, it's, like, 1 0 miles away.
Ten- So what?
These legs were made for pedalin'.
Come on.
- You've seen my thighs.
- Yeah.
You're a good boyfriend.
''You're a good boyfriend'' who?
I'm not calling you Principal Forman.
Don't make me get the ruler, young lady.
Red can take Eric's car, but he can have my car candy when he pries it from my cold, dead fingers.
- You were right.
Ten miles is nothing.
-   Will you pick me up from school every day?
Sure.
Uh, which-which arm hurts when you're about to have a heart attack?
Help!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Whatever.
Whatever.
Yeah, like I care.
All right.
I'll talk to you later,Jackie.
Ew.
Do you mind not getting all gooey and romantic when I'm about to eat my breakfast?
What crawled up your butt?
You and Jackie.
Then you started making out in there.
Hey!
No more butt talk at breakfast.
Look, if you're not gonna break up with Jackie then you have to tell Kelso, okay?
- It's like the ethical thing to do.
- Thank you,Johnny Cub Scout.
What are you gonna do, take away my friendship merit badge?
No, because Cub Scouts are awarded achievement beads.
Badges.
- So, anybody hungry?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Starved!
Ladies first.
Or ladies only.
Oh, well, um- well, it's not all for me.
I'm eating for two now.
-  What?
- I'm pregnant.
Oh, God.
No!
I mean, great.
Kitty, are you sure you're-you're pregnant?
Maybe you're just puttin' on your winter weight.
Red, a woman knows.
Not to mention I'm late.
And not for work.
For my menstrual cycle.
Hooray!
That is great news, Mrs. Forman.
Now, you stay away from those smokes.
If you smoke when you're pregnant, they come out all spindly.
Shut up.
Mom, congratulations.
This is awesome.
Please, love me the most.
Well, you're sure being quiet over there, Red.
I'm soaking in the moment.
Okay.
I-I know this is unexpected but I just think it's gonna bring us so much happiness, don't you?
Sure.
You know how much I love babies.
Oh, what a day.
I am so happy.
I'm just- I'm just gonna go throw up.
I just don't understand how this could have happened.
Hmm.
Maybe it's about time we had ''the talk.
'' You see, when a boy loves a girl- - Doesn't have to love her.
- That's true.
''Anyhoo,'' the boy's sexual organ- Hey!
Shut it, dumb-ass.
Wow.
That kid's gonna love it here.
I can't believe they're having a baby.
I can't believe they're still having sex.
I mean, my Dad's back goes out if you look at him wrong.
- That's why she was probably on top.
- Thanks.
Thanks, Hyde.
You just killed a part of me.
Yeah.
That's why you got to put on your raincoat every damn time.
Well, except for the first time.
Free pass!
No, Kelso, that's just a myth.
You're only safe if you do it underwater.
Right, Hyde?
That's right, buddy.
Oops.
Oh, a little help, Donna.
- Sure.
- Oh, nice!
Catch this, tool!
- What was that for?
- You keep dropping the ball.
Well, so I'm a butterfingers.
Isn't that punishment enough?
Now look.
The ball's all the way over there in the backyard.
Little help, Donna.
God!
Fine, I'll get it.
God!
Hey, Steven.
I had fun last night.
- You had fun doing what?
- Huh?
Hey, Michael.
Um, I went to the movies.
Right, Donna?
Oh, um, I don't know.
I was with Eric all night.
But I'm really interested in this movie.
Why don't you tell us all about it?
Donna?
Fine.
You know, it's that new movie starring that big, red whore.
Oh, you mean, the one where the big, red whore is sick of people keeping secrets.
No.
No, no.
The one where the big, red whore keeps sticking her big, red nose in places where it doesn't belong.
Hey.
Watch what you say about the big, red whore.
Thank you, Eric.
What did Sissy Spacek ever do to any of you?
Way to go, guys.
You know how he feels about Sissy!
Fez, wait!
Donna, what is with you?
Look, I'm sick of covering for your creepy, unnatural relationship.
And I shouldn't have to.
I mean, Hyde, you and Kelso have been friends forever, and you owe it to him to tell him.
Yeah, this is way worse than when you stole his headgear and used it to clean out your sink.
It's tough love, man.
You know what?
Forget it.
You obviously don't care about Kelso or any of the rest of us.
Yeah, 'cause when this blows up, guess what.
We're all screwed.
Steven, do you really think we're a creepy, unnatural couple?
Come on.
That's a crazy question.
I mean, if this relationship wasn't just a little bit creepy and unnatural I wouldn't be in it.
Oh, Eric, look.
Your little, pink baby sweater.
Oh, oh, and the matching pink bonnet.
Um, had they explained to you yet that I was a boy?
Oh, I am just so excited about this baby.
Well, yeah.
You should be.
And Dad should be too.
What's with him anyway?
Oh, no.
That's just his way.
He'll be fine.
When I first told him about you he said, ''Oh, crap!
'' and stormed out.
But then he came back happy as a clam.
And then, of course, when you got older, he got mad again on account of you not being so very good at sports.
Don't worry about your father.
He'll come around.
He always does.
My ''banky-boo''!
Hey, Forman.
So I've decided I'm gonna tell Kelso about me and Jackie.
Well, well.
I'm glad you finally decided to listen to your conscience.
It's not my conscience, man, 'cause I don't have a conscience.
You know that.
It's just 'cause, you know I figured me and Jackie might be together a little while, so- But, man, she's the devil.
What can I do?
She's hot.
No, you only think she's hot because she's made of hellfire.
All right.
What if you were stranded on a desert island with her?
Murder-suicide.
Okay.
PictureJackie in a little bikini made out of coconuts.
Where's our signal fire?
And don't give me any, ''Oh, boo-hoo, my hands are bleeding.
'' Suck it up.
Aw, damn, I got a splinter.
You couldn't grab the tweezers as the ship was going down?
Moron.
Well, that was unpleasant.
Okay.
Try it again.
But this time do what I do.
Good God, she is hot.
Hey, guys.
What you talkin' about?
Indy 500.
- Nice.
- All right.
Hey, can one of you guys give me a ride to the D.M.V. tomorrow?
- I lost my license in California.
- Sure, Hyde'll take you.
- What?
- Yeah.
It will give you two a chance to catch up.
He can tell you how he spent his summer break.
Yeah.
All right.
- So what happened to your license, man?
- Oh, a shark ate it.
Really?
How?
Fine.
I lost it.
You happy now!
Oh, here you are.
How ya feeling?
Better?
I bet you're feeling better.
I'm fine.
Is that liquor on your breath?
What is the matter with you, Red?
Well- You know- I mean- It's just- I'm not sellin' the Corvette!
- What?
- Kids are expensive.
That's gonna be the first thing to go.
I waited 25 years to have that car because we had kids.
And believe me, I love them.
But this is supposed to be our time.
Kitty, people our age don't have kids.
They have grandkids.
Well, we're having a kid, so deal with it.
Well, I'm having a Corvette, so deal with that!
Ooh, a staring contest.
I got winner.
Okay, Mr. Red, it looks like it's just you and me.
Still the king.
And here I am ecstatic, and Red comes home babbling about his precious Corvette.
Well, I'll tell you something.
I may be the one who's pregnant, but I did not get that way by myself.
He's the one who wouldn't go to sleep.
You know, Mrs. Forman, there are other ways of dealing with that.
I mean, have you tried telling him you just like him as a friend?
You're carrying Red's baby.
He should be kissing your ass.
God!
Why are men such jerks?
Huh?
Tell me.
Well, I just came in here for the ice cream so I'm just gonna make mine to go.
Men plant their seed and think their work is done.
But women have a being growing inside of us the size of a wine jug.
It's got to come out somehow.
Oh, oh, oh.
It's like that nature show, you know where the snake eats an antelope in one bite, and you're thinking, ''Impossible.
'' And then it-it-it unhinges its jaw, and in it goes.
Well, giving birth is just like that, only the other direction.
And I need your father there, holding my hand and telling me it's okay because I can't swallow an antelope alone.
No, you can't.
And no woman should have to.
That bastard.
Ah, we've been here for, like, an hour.
We've only moved, like, two feet.
You think the lines at the D.M.V. are long?
You should see the free clinic.
Now, there's a wait.
Man, you've been to the free clinic?
No.
Oh, but I did see your mom there.
Burn!
That's gonna leave a mark.
Just like your mom did!
Come on.
Move it!
Damn!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry you had to see my dark side.
Please excuse me.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Ta-ta.
Look, man, I got to talk to you about some things that happened while you were gone this summer.
Hyde, if this is about free ice cream, naked volleyball or a dog wearing a hat and sunglasses, I'd rather not even know.
No, it's aboutJackie.
What aboutJackie?
She was with someone, I knew it.
Damn it!
Well, you know, you guys are broken up, so who cares, right?
We're not- I don't care.
It's just- I mean, she was a big part of my life and I just hate the thought of her being off with some random guy.
Well, what if I told you it was with a friend?
Would that make it better?
No.
That would make it worse, stupid.
Aw, you're messing with me.
Okay, 'cause I- A friend would never do that.
Aw, man.
Hyde, you got me again.
Just like I got your mom!
What is with the hitting?
Guys?
I love this place.
I want to work here.
You just said you hated it.
Yeah, but I went up to the counter, and the guy treated me like crap.
But he was treating everybody like crap- poor, rich, black, white.
We're all crap.
And look at him.
Think he was popular in high school?
No way.
But now he's the belle of the ball.
Well, my friends, it's my turn to get a taste of those balls.
Hey.
I was just inside with Mom and she's really upset.
I just want to know- What's your problem?
You made me bald.
- What?
- Five generations- not one bald head in my family.
Then you came along, and- Well, look at it.
Children make me bald.
You know what?
Wear a hat.
'Cause Mom is really scared and she could really use a little damn support right now.
And I don't usually tell you what to do 'cause you usually do the right thing, but this time you didn't.
You know how you're always telling me to be a man?
Well, be a man!
I made you bald?
You made me skinny!
Oh, hey.
How'd it go at the D.M.V.?
Did you tell Kelso?
Nah, I blew it off.
What?
Why?
I don't know.
It's just really hot in there.
Really?
'Cause I think you chickened out.
No, I didn't chicken out, man.
I just didn't want to drop the news in front of all those people, you know?
I mean, haven't I done enough to the guy?
So you felt bad?
Oh, my God, you felt bad!
No, I don't feel bad.
I don't feel anything.
I don't know.
I think someone's been to Oz and gotten himself a heart.
- Shut up, Forman.
- Yeah, Eric.
Maybe we should lay off.
He's had a rough day.
- Aw.
- I really want to lay off but it's just so hot in here.
Get bent!
-  - He felt bad.
- I think we really got through to him.
- Yeah.
- He's not gonna tell Kelso.
- No.
Oh.
So you're hiding out here.
Got a call for some man about a Corvette.
What, you gonna buy another one so you can ride 'em around like a couple of water skis?
- I'm selling the Corvette.
- What?
Look, could we finish this later?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Is that Eric's old cradle?
Yeah, well, uh, the paint was all chipped off and I kind of remember that, uh- that they liked sleepin' in this thing when they weren't peein' and poopin' all over the place.
Oh, Red.
That is so sweet.
Yeah, well it might be fun.
Hell, this time we might even get an athlete.
Oh!
- Hey.
- Hey.
So did you tell Michael yet?
Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna, but, um, you know the timing just didn't seem right.
Oh, I-I understand.
I mean, it's kind of like- it's kind of like setting your hair.
If you don't wait long enough, then it's totally flat and-  like Donna's.
But if you wait just the right amount of time, then it's perfect like mine.
Steven, are you even listening to me?
God help me, I am.
Steven.
So that's what an adulteress is.
I always thought that it was a tiny adult.
Hey, uh- Hey, buddy, what do you say we take this party back to the living room, huh?
Um, yeah, that's a good idea.
No, but I want a peanut butter and banana-  Why is Hyde kissin'Jackie?
What the hell?
He's dead.
They have a lot of questions in the D.M.V. application.
Let's see.
''Sex''?
Please.
Lots.
''Address''?
If I must, but I prefer pants.
''State''?
Nervous but excited.
''Mother's maiden name''?
Streisand, but she won't acknowledge me.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Why is Hyde kissin'Jackie?
What the hell?
- He's dead!
- Kelso!
Open, damn it!
No, they're gettin' away!
What is wrong with this thing?
Well, this is against my better judgment, but-  Thank you.
Now Hyde's really dead.
Oh!
That's invisible!
Donna, we have to stabilize him.
We're gonna need pudding, and lots of it.
Who chooses a chick over a friend?
Kelso, come on.
Remember when you made me walk home in a blizzard 'cause you wanted 1 0 extra minutes to make out with Pam Macy?
No, but I didn't steal Pam Macy from you.
And you could've played in the snow until we were done.
Kelso, try to look at the facts.
Jackie wanted to get married, so you bailed so she found someone else, so now she doesn't wanna marry you.
This solves your problem, albeit with an unpleasant twist ending.
No.
I don't care.
I'm kickin' Hyde's ass.
Kelso, Kelso, come on.
You couldn't open my kitchen door.
I mean- Seriously, think about how this plan usually turns out.
That's my eye!
Nice.
Aah.
My eye!
That's my butt print!
Look at it!
No two are the same!
Ow!
My eye!
Uh, what am I supposed to do?
He broke the code!
He's wrong!
You know what?
You're right.
He's, like, my oldest friend, and he stabbed me in the back.
So, Kelso, how many things around here have you put your butt on?
Let's start with what I haven't put my butt on.
Oh,just a moment.
Red, it's somebody about buying the Corvette.
Well, Marlin, we've just seen the male of the herd grunt his displeasure.
But what does it mean?
- The grunting indicates aggression,Jim.
- Ah!
Idiots.
I am about to sell something special to me, because we're having another baby.
And to do that, I have to believe that this child won't turn out a smart-ass!
Hello.
Yes.
Don't call here again.
- Well, what happened?
- The guy sounded like he was eating.
I don't want some fat bastard eating in my car.
Anyway, I'm going to the doctor's this afternoon-  because I'm pregnant!
Oh.
Oh.
And you're picking your grandparents up from the airport.
I'm going to tell them that  I'm pregnant!
They get in from Phoenix at 5:00.
You know, I was hoping when they moved to Arizona, they'd get lost in the desert.
-What's wrong with Mrs. Forman's parents?
-Nothing.
They're just- They're very complicated people who can't be summed up in a couple of words.
- Grandma yells, Grandpa drinks.
- That pretty much summed it up.
Now, that is not true.
My father is a wonderful man who just gets a little sleepy.
And my mother, well- fine- is a little remote which, I have learned through many helpful books makes it impossible for her to say, ''I love you.
'' Even if it's the only thing in the world a sad little girl needs to hear.
And which is why I say it to you every day.
Eric, I love you.
-  -  And you too, Steven.
I love you!
Oh, yeah.
No, that's okay.
You don't have to- No, that's all right.
Okay, I love you too.
I can't believe that you knew Jackie and Hyde were together and you didn't tell me.
We barely knew.
Yeah, we knew, but we were in denial because it's so unnatural.
Like radioactive spiders.
Well, that's true.
I'm- It's just- How can Hyde do this to me?
- Uh-oh.
It sounds like he knows.
- Finally.
What, your mom knew?
And Fez?
Fez never knows anything!
I know.
I'm really coming into my own.
Whatever.
You know, none of this is as bad as Hyde not telling me.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna make him tell me.
- How are you gonna do that?
- By outwitting him conversationally.
What a fine game of cat and mouse it will be.
I'm gonna go find an eye patch.
- So, what are you gonna say?
- Oh, it'll come to me in the moment.
Don't you think you should plan it out a little?
Does an astronaut plan out his missions?
What happens in cat and mouse if the cat is retarded?
Oh, you just wait and see.
- What's up?
- That's an interesting question, Hyde.
What is up?
- Well, I guess you know about me and Jackie.
- Ahh!
So the battle of wits has begun!
What battle of wits?
I admit it.
I've been messin' around with Jackie.
I hate you!
Ow!
My eye!
Thanks again for the dream catchers.
A blind Indian with three fingers made those.
It was quite a thing to watch.
Wow.
I wonder if him being blind had something to do with the losing the fingers.
Actually, I think they were taken as part of a primitive manhood ritual.
Eric, I kinda like your grandparents.
What were you so worried about?
- Wait for it.
- Burt, sweetie, I think that car is trying to pass.
- Why don't you move over?
- Oh, he's fine.
Honey, I really think you should move over.
- Sweetie, he can go around.
-  Move!
- I'm moving.
-  And when he saw you guys kissing, he just fell apart.
I mean, it was awful.
And then he ran into the screen door.
Oh, he's just so bad at doors.
Look, if you don't work things out with Kelso everybody's gonna choose sides, and nobody's gonna be friends anymore.
Well, that's not my fault.
Look, he deserted me.
He broke my heart.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- You're dating his best friend!
You've gotta talk to him.
You owe him an explanation.
This is so not the way I wanted to spend the day.
Well, I didn't wanna spend the day wiping tears and pudding off of Kelso's cheek.
Burt, honey, why don't you come over and sit with us?
I'm fine here.
We'd really like it if you would sit and join the party.
- I'm part of the party right here.
-  Sit!
So, Burt, you're lookin' fit.
Dry heat and central air.
That's the key.
Uh-huh.
I've even got an air-conditioned garage.
We can go from the house to the car without ever feeling the heat.
Wow.
They literally never have to breathe fresh air.
Wow.
Who needs it?
Yep.
Well, those are some real nice sandals, Burt.
Hardly ever see those on men.
Also made by the handicapped Indian.
What spirit.
Oh, um, everybody's here.
- Here she is.
- Hello, Mom, Daddy.
Kitty, tell everyone your wonderful news.
Quick.
- I'd really rather not right now, Red.
- But that's why we're here.
Yeah, for the love of God, Mom, tell them.
- No, I said not right now.
- Kitty, they came all this way.
- Yeah, come on.
- Fine.
You wanna hear the big news?
The doctor told me I started menopause.
Kitty, language!
- You're not pregnant?
- Nope.
Nope.
Just barren.
Talk about that.
Mom, I'm really sorry.
I know you wanted a baby, but I'm not really sure what to say mainly because I'm not really sure what menopause is.
Are you-Are you gonna, like, lose your hair?
Shut up!
She's not losing anything.
This just means that from time to time- A woman's body-  Kitty, explain it to the boy.
I'm just getting some juice.
Hey, Mom, maybe you should talk to Grandma about this.
Now, that's an idea.
I mean, we're just ignoramuses.
Okay, okay.
Scoot.
Is it- Is it like a lady-parts thing?
We'll look it up in the World Book.
Oh, those cookies look good.
Well, thanks.
Sorry I made a scene.
Oh, you were just tired.
No, I wasn't just tired.
Mom, I'm having a really hard time here.
Did it hit you this hard too?
- Did what, dear?
- Menopause.
I never had it.
Mom, everybody has it.
Well, I've always been quite health conscious.
I told you to eat more vegetables.
You cannot expect me to believe that you never went through menopause.
- Well, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Well, it doesn't matter, because it's not nice to talk about.
Not everything that needs to be talked about has to be nice.
Mom, why don't you ever really talk to me?
I told you I liked your cookies!
I'm gonna find your father.
Burt!
Is she gone?
You know, that woman is crazy.
Your mother just doesn't know how to talk to people.
If she yells at you she really means that she's sorry you're upset.
And if she breaks all your golf clubs she means ''happy anniversary.
'' Oh, Daddy, I love you.
I love you, punkin, and so does your mother.
Burt.
!
- You never saw me.
- Okay.
Try to get my eye now!
Hyde, get off!
.
Not until you calm down.
- Ah!
A wet one!
-  Fez, I'm gonna get free eventually, and then I'm gonna kick your ass!
Kelso, look, man, we need to settle this.
No, I don't wanna settle this!
I don't wanna talk about it!
All I wanna do is pound you so you can feel as bad as I do!
Fine.
Fair enough.
Go ahead and hit me.
Free shot.
You gonna hit me back?
No, man.
That's why they call it a free shot.
Oh.
Okay.
Get ready.
Here it comes.
It's comin'.
Get ready.
We're ready.
Do it, fool!
You know what?
Forget it.
It's not gonna change anything.
I just- Forget it.
Look, Kelso I didn't plan for this, but- Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm- I'm really sorry.
Aw!
Would you get bent?
-So what are we gonna do now?
-I'll tell you what you guys are gonna do.
You two are gonna shake hands, and you're gonna be done with it.
No.
Come on.
Give it a try.
Shake hands.
- I don't wanna.
-  Shake!
-  - Well, well.
Look who it is.
Uh, look, Michael, I'm glad I found you.
- How's your eye?
- What do you care?
Okay.
Look, Michael, I know we should've told you sooner but I'm not gonna say I'm sorry because I wanted you, and you left and broke my heart.
And I like Steven now so you need to get over it so we can all become friends again.
Apology accepted.
Here, let me help you.
- Ow.
My eye.
- Yeah.
Hey.
- How you doin'?
- Oh, great.
It's so nice to no longer be a woman.
Kitty, that's not true.
You know, I've been tryin' to think what I could do to- to make you feel better, and I finally came up with something.
I sent your parents home early.
That kinda helps.
I just- I really wanted to be pregnant.
You know what the real kicker is?
This morning, when we thought you were still pregnant I sold my Corvette.
Memorial Day, meningitis- Okay, here we go.
Menopause.
Good God!
I didn't think they'd have pictures.
Well, at least they use the word ''uterus'' a lot.
I could've gone a whole lifetime without knowing they had a mucus membrane.
Well, you just- You can't unlearn something like that, you know?
Oh, no.
Look at the symptoms.
''Temperamental behavior, mood swings, facial hair.
'' Uh-oh.
Dad, I think you have menopause.
Hey, Eric, can you hand me a cookie?
No, I can't reach while I'm driving.
- Come on.
Please?
Just one cookie.
-Just wait till I stop.
Cookie!
You know, Donna, you catch more flies with sugar.
Right, Burt?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
You know, Eric, I'm really happy with our relationship right now.
Yeah, me too.
It's like we're way past the ''broken up and miserable'' stage and we're back in the ''having sex again'' stage, so- Yeah.
Thumbs up from this end too.
Yeah.
I'm serious.
I mean, we've been through a lot and even though some of it wasn't exactly fun- I mean, it was worth it, because now we know that we can handle anything.
And we don't freak out about the little stuff.
Right.
Like that time we got in that big fight because I ran over your cat.
- That wasn't little stuff.
I really loved that cat.
- Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
No, I know.
I- I mean, uh, the cat was little.
Anyway, when you came to California, I knew you were the one.
So I got you a gift to symbolize how far we've come.
Is it, like, one of those gifts that women get for men but they actually wear themselves?
Here.
-  - It's a ring.
Yeah.
And I'm a man.
Yeah.
It's a man-ring.
A man-ring.
Yea!
Morning.
What the hell's that thing on your finger?
This is my new man-ring.
Donna got it for me, so I'll feel right at home when the gypsies come to town.
Well, take it off.
You look like some kind of fruity magician.
Well, I think it's sweet.
I can enjoy these things now because I am not gonna let menopause get me down.
Mm-mmm.
No depression, night sweats, or sudden mood swings for me.
Well, I guess that's starting today, huh?
'Cause last night, you hit the trifecta there.
Well, I just refuse to be sad about the fact that I'm never gonna have another baby.
I don't need another baby.
I got a lot to look forward to.
Like picking out my casket.
- Oh, Kitty.
- I- - It's okay.
-  You've still got Eric.
He's sort of a baby.
I'll make him cry if you want.
- Man, that is one big-ass ring!
-  Hey, maybe people'll think you won the Super Bowl.
Nah.
Nobody'd believe that.
But he could be the sick little kid the whole team rallies around.
Well, guys.
Wish me luck.
Today I have a job interview at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
All right.
Good luck, man.
Oh, Eric.
What a glorious man-ring.
See, I told you to accessorize and you finally listened, huh?
- Man, you like it?
- Yeah.
What's not to like?
It's hypnotic.
It looks like he has superpowers.
Man, I'd like to see the lame-o superhero that had to wear that ring.
Okay, super pals I need a danger alert status report.
My sensors indicate peace and quiet throughout the universe.
I think the oceans are secure, but I cannot check for another 45 minutes.
Because I just ate.
- Hi, guys.
- No.
You've been brainwashed and forced to wear this hideously ugly ring!
Actually, it's a gift.
From me.
Form of- the worst gift ever.
Shape of- uh, hope you kept the receipt.
-  - Oh, no!
Alien zombies are attacking the Earth.
- Let's swing into action, gang.
- Hang on a second!
We're still on this ring.
Are you sure it's not an evil alien artifact?
I got it at the mall.
Greetings, super dumb-asses.
Oh, no!
It's Dr. Bald.
Any minute now, my army of alien zombies will be inva- Good Lord!
That is an ugly ring!
Hey, alien zombies, get a load of that ring!
- All right.
That's it.
This thing's comin' off.
- Oh, whoa!
Be careful, man.
You drop something that big and heavy, it'll throw off the Earth's rotation.
We'll all go crashing into the sun.
Way to use science in a burn.
-  - Donna, guess who hates the ring you got him?
Eric hates the ring?
- He told me he loved it.
- Well.
See Eric told Steven that the ring was so ugly that the Elephant Man wears it to distract people from his face.
That ring is beautiful.
You know, what's ugly is his bony little finger.
Hey.
You know what?
If he can't appreciate it let's just take it back and buy me somethin' pretty.
According to your application, your last job was as Dancer Number Three in the school production of My Fair Lady.
Yes.
It was magical.
Uh-huh.
I'm afraid your theater experience doesn't really apply to working here at the D.M.V. But, Nina, what is the D.M.V. really, if not one big stage?
The D.M.V. is the Department of Motor Vehicles.
It is not a stage.
Ah, but in a way, they're very similar.
- No, they're not.
- Oh, but really, they are.
- No, they're not.
- Okay.
- They are.
- No, they're not!
I'm just gonna put down no prior experience.
Fair enough.
Ah, but you haven't asked me about my special skills yet.
Well, I really don't see how a fondness for pie is relevant.
But, Nina, what is the D.M.V. really, if not one big pie shop?
Great.
Clicker's on the fritz.
All I want to do is see the end of Guiding Light, and it won't click.
-  - Click, damn it!
Click!
Kitty?
I think your lady problem is acting up again.
It jus- It just won't click, that's all.
It's supposed to click, Red.
It's a clicker.
That's what it does.
Okay.
Let's get you to bed.
Okay, you guys?
Uh, very important.
Donna's coming over, and I lost the ring she gave me.
- I thought I had it in the basement.
- Eric, please!
Your mother is having a breakdown.
No.
The only thing having a breakdown around here is the clicker!
Why won't it click, Red?
Nothing loves me!
Okay, Eric.
Jackie just told me that Hyde told her that you hate the ring.
Uh-oh.
I happen to think it's beautiful.
Besides, that is what a man-ring looks like.
Well, you know, Donna, maybe I'm just not a man-ring kind of guy.
I mean, I like man-pants and man-shirts.
Eric, you could've just told me you didn't like it when I gave it to you.
You know what?
Just- Just give it back.
I absolutely will just as soon as I find it.
What?
How could you lose it?
I told you it was a symbol of our loving freakin' relationship!
And my losing it is a symbol of how much I love and respect you?
I need cold compresses and a Bloody Mary.
Quick!
Your mother is talking about adopting a communist orphan.
Now move.
I need help, damn it!
I don't understand.
How could I lose a 25-pound ring?
I once lost a six-foot-long rubber chili dog.
And I still haven't found it.
It's just gone!
You know what, Hyde?
This whole thing's your fault.
You're the one who told Jackie I didn't like the ring.
Hyde stabbed you in the back?
No.
He wouldn't do anything like that.
Like he didn't stealJackie from me.
Oh, wait a minute!
Look, man.
I told her not to tell.
Yeah.
And I told you not to tell.
You and Jackie are gossiping now?
You know, the more you two go out, the more like each other you get.
Yeah.
Who knows what you and your little girlfriend are gonna be like in a couple months.
-  -  Two, four, six, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
Go team!
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!
Number one!
Yeah!
Jackie?
I heard the best piece of gossip.
Eric Forman doesn't have any school spirit.
I'm tellin' everyone!
- Too late.
I already did.
-  First of all, Jackie is not my girlfriend.
And second of all, I'm not the only one who spills stuff around here.
Yeah.
You're right.
Hey, Kelso.
Hyde watches Little House on the Prairie.
Little House on the Prairie?
It reminds me of a simpler time.
How could Eric lose that ring?
And more importantly, how could he think it was ugly?
It's got real nugget-gold plating and the abalone is inlaid.
If you were my girlfriend, I would be proud to wear that ring.
Heck, I'd wear it if you just wanted to fool around a little.
Get my drift, Big ''D''?
All I know is, you guys better watch what you say around here.
Some people can't be trusted because they have a great, big mouth!
Jackie!
How could you say that?
My mouth is in perfect proportion to the rest of my face.
Plenty of classy men wear rings.
Wayne Newton.
The pope.
My Uncle Carmine from Hoboken.
You lose his ring, you wake up in a Dumpster.
And that's just a warning!
Now I think that's all the questions I have about your application.
Okay, but one thing my application doesn't say is how much I would apply myself to the job here.
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop making puns now.
I really don't think this is going to work out, so-  Wow!
That is a gorgeous man-ring.
You know, wearing a ring this big shows a lot of confidence.
Well, I do feel like a king when I wear it.
And, you know, what is the D.M.V. really, if not one big kingdom?
You know what?
You're stubborn, under qualified and you barely speak English.
Welcome to the D.M.V. Wait a minute.
You're mad at me for telling Donna a secret?
Steven, I tell secrets.
It's who I am.
Look.
All I'm sayin' is, if you're gonna be my girlfriend you can't go runnin' around, shootin' off your big, fat, cheerleader mouth.
You just called me your girlfriend.
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
Yes, you did, and shut up.
You're ruining it!
Okay, now listen to me.
I'll keep my mouth shut, if you admit that I'm your girlfriend.
No, the price is too high.
Okay, fine.
You know what?
I'm telling everybody everything anyways.
Starting with the fact that you called me your girlfriend.
You're blackmailing me?
You're coming along nicely.
Good news.
I got the job.
What the hell is that on your finger?
Oh, it's chocolate and coconut.
I can't believe you took my ring.
Oh.
Yes.
I took it.
I took it, and I'm proud.
You don't deserve something this beautiful.
You have a girlfriend.
You have a ring.
I have nothing!
Well, you-you have a job.
Well, that's true.
Good for me.
You guys, look at this thing.
God, what was Donna thinking?
Forman, you gotta expect this.
I mean, look at her dad.
The apple doesn't fall far from the Bob.
Now, this ring's a wolf attackin' a zebra.
This one's a zebra attackin' a wolf.
And in this one, they're finally friends.
Hey, there.
Hi, there.
Ho, there.
Let's go.
I'm not goin' to the game with you in that jacket, Bob.
I'm not goin' to the game, Bob.
My God, she never had a chance.
Hyde, my girlfriend has bad taste.
Well, she is dating you.
Ah, a good burn, Fez.
And that ring is only the beginning, man.
I can see it now.
Eric, you look so foxy.
Hey, there.
Hi, there.
Ho, there.
Ta-da!
Look what I found.
And I didn't even lose it.
Fez took it.
So, basically, you got mad at me for being a victim of robbery.
Okay.
Apologetic look accepted.
Eric, I got mad at you for not being honest, and that hasn't changed.
Really?
Huh, I thought it might've.
I gave you the ring as a symbol of how far we've come in our relationship.
And if you can't be honest, then you shouldn't be wearing that ring at all.
Okay.
You want me to be honest?
Okay.
I kind of think that you have bad taste.
What?
I do not!
Okay.
Well, then, tell me what you think of this room- this turquoise-and-chrome disaster of a room.
I think it's classy and sophisticated.
You know, maybe you're the one who has bad taste.
In fact- Why don't you tell me about this pea-soup-colored chair?
I think it's comfortable and soothing, just like pea soup.
Well, I think this whole room is a great example of bad taste.
- Excuse me?
- Uh, Mrs. Forman.
I have spent years picking every item in this room so that I would be surrounded by the things I love and the people I thought loved me.
Hey, Kitty?
How about a nap?
And you.
Have you fixed the damn clicker yet?
What good is a clicker if it won't click?
Oh, my goodness.
I am flying right off the handle.
Seems to me you're just as pleasant as always.
Ooh, that is sweet.
Oh.
I think I'd like to take a nap now.
Wha- Did you see that?
I told you the truth, and we got into a fight.
My dad told my mom she's pleasant- a whopper of a lie- and they've been married 1 50 years.
I don't care.
I want you to tell me the truth all the time.
No.
No, you don't.
It's like when women ask whether or not their outfit makes them look fat.
How many men tell them they look fat?
Zero.
How many women look fat?
Not zero.
That is totally different.
No, Donna.
No, it isn't.
Look, how could I look you in the eye and tell you that I don't like the ring when I love you so much?
I guess I know what you mean.
It's like when you wrote me that song.
Wait.
You love that song.
Of course I do.
You know what?
We are really bad with rings.
Yeah.
If we ever get married, we should just exchange, like buckets of chicken.
Or, uh, I- I could write you another song.
- Oh.
I'm fine with chicken.
- Okay.
Does this outfit make my butt look fat?
No.
You look super.
So, uh.
Wonder Boy and I are thinking about movin' in together.
My parents are gonna freak!
- You think your parents are gonna freak?
- Yeah, we're twins.
It really hurts my feelings that you call me Dr. Bald.
Just because I'm evil doesn't mean I don't cry.
Super jerks!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Okay.
So, is everyone ready for our big trip to the University of Wisconsin?
Yeah, Donna and I have it all mapped out.
She is going to buy a tight sweater with a big, red ''W'' on it, and I am going to watch her wear it.
And then we're gonna buckle down.
Oh, Steven, I put out some clean clothes for you to take on the trip.
Uh, thanks, Mrs. Forman, but I'm not really the college type.
I get my learnin' on the street.
Steven, you're a smart kid.
If you would only just apply yourself -you could go to college too.
- You don't trust me alone in the house, do you?
See how smart you are?
Well, I just can't believe my baby is all grown up and visiting college!
I am so freakin' old!
And menopause makes another unwelcome appearance at the dinner table.
Oh, no, it's not unwelcome.
It's- It's liberating.
Now my emotions just spill out.
Yeah, Mom.
You're sweating all over your pork chop.
Hey!
There's my favorite coed.
- Hey, are you all packed for Visitors Weekend?
- I can't go.
My dad's makin' me visit Marquette instead.
He thinks it's a better school, 'cause it's private.
Oh, and 'cause it sounds French.
Well, you know what?
We'll just go with you.
I mean, if it's a better school then I belong there too, right, Dad?
No.
State schools are cheap.
That's where you belong.
Well, what if, like, you took out a second mortgage on the house?
Not for you, dumb-ass.
I have a bad feeling about this weekend, Eric.
Nothing good can come from us visiting different schools.
Well, yeah, but there's an upside.
Two days apart?
I mean, when we get together it's gonna be electric, baby!
Like a thunderstorm.
Eric, I'm serious!
I mean, what if we actually end up going to different colleges?
And we're apart for four years?
Then, come semester break, you better board up your windows.
'Cause guess what?
Here comes Hurricane Eric.
Board up my windows?
What are my windows?
- And whatever they are, wouldn't you want them open?
- Hmm.
Look, Donna.
All I'm saying is that I think we can get through anything.
We go to different schools now, and we're fine because our love is strong.
Like a big, burly bear.
So zip up your tent, 'cause guess what.
This bear has claws.
- Again, wouldn't you want my tent open?
- Mmm.
Hold it, you two.
Now, before we hit the road we need to have a talk about that horrible thing that's taken over your mother.
You mean, her ''change of life''?
Thought we were calling it ''the lady-parts problem.
'' It goes by many names.
Now, we're dealing with a tricky enemy here.
I haven't been this frosty since Korea.
And just like a commie it can jump out and attack you at any moment.
-  Red, honey.
!
- Incoming!
Retreat!
Red, um, you know, I've been a tad bit moody lately.
So, um if you don't want me to go on this trip, I'll understand.
Well, you know, honey, there's really no need for you to go.
I knew you didn't want me to go!
Well, I am going, whether you like it or not.
Why is it so damn hot in here?
It's like it's- It's like we're living in hell!
You can say that again.
So, Steven?
When I go to Marquette with Donna this weekend there'll be lots of cute boys around.
Lucky you.
Well, unlucky them, because I won't let them kiss me.
Yeah, that's my promise to you.
Now, I'm not saying you have to promise me anything.
But if you want to, now would be a good time.
Okay, well,just know that I won't be kissing anyone.
Good to know.
''Good to know''?
That's it?
Did I stutter?
Oh, thanks for the help.
You seem to have a natural talent for handling luggage.
Red?
Honey.
You know, I'm sorry about our little spat.
- The last thing I want to do is ruin our trip.
- Oh, sweetheart, that's okay.
-  -  - Wow, Mom certainly cheered up.
- Don't be fooled.
She's a ticking time bomb.
Hey!
Wait up!
What do you want?
The explanation's pinned to my lapel.
''Dear Red.
Mr. Kelso and I are unable to take Michael to U.W. Here's $30 so he can go with you.
'' - Where's the 30 bucks?
- Oh, I bought this ''electronical'' football game.
I swear to God, Kelso!
You make Eric look like Einstein.
Thank you, Daddy.
''Thank you''?
Einstein was ugly.
Oh!
It's like a sauna in here.
Wish you didn't all have to breathe so much.
All right, guys.
You heard the lady.
No more breathing!
No, I didn't tell you not to breathe, I asked you not to breathe as much.
There's a difference.
!
To crazy people.
Hey, Ali Baba.
Close sesame.
- Oh!
Red!
You just missed the exit.
- Oh, damn it!
Eric, you're supposed to be following the map.
What the hell are you doing back there?
Makin' you a crown?
'Cause you're ''King of the Road''!
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Can you turn up the radio?
- First and goal!
- How much further?
-  - Touchdown!
Would you all just shut up?
This is stupid.
I mean, why am I looking at a school I don't even want to go to?
Should've gone to U.W. with Eric.
And I should've laughed at his thunderstorm jokes.
You know, I bet those sluts at U.W. will laugh at them.
Sluts!
What, U.W. has sluts?
Steven loves sluts!
He's not gonna do anything.
He's with you now.
I don't know if he is or not.
I mean, look.
Last week, he called me his girlfriend.
And then this week, I couldn't even trick him into promising me he wouldn't fool around with someone else.
And I was very passive-aggressive.
I believe that.
Donna, I promised to be faithful.
And all he said was, ''Good to know.
'' ''Good to know, '' Donna!
You know, I am too depressed to go to orientation with you.
Steven crushed my spirit, and now there's only one place I can turn to.
Please, God, don't let it be me.
No.
The cheerleading demonstration.
I mean, at first, when they yell, ''We've got spirit, how 'bout you?
'' Well, of course, I'll have to say no!
But- But show me a human pyramid and a really sharp pom-pom waterfall and I'll get it back.
What the hell kind of college is this?
Barefoot hippies playin' Frisbee barefoot hippies singin' songs to trees- Man, this place is awesome!
Look, they even have dirty cartoons on the wall.
Kelso, those are C.P.R. instructions.
Wow, I've done C.P.R. a lot.
Hi.
I'm Ted, resident adviser.
- Hi.
- Why don't you folks have a look around and I'll show the boys where they're gonna be staying.
I don't know about this place.
I'll say.
It's the middle of November.
I don't see any Thanksgiving decorations.
Visitors Weekend is great.
We always have a big dorm party, tons of beer, tons of chicks.
Hey, I just need one six-pack and two chicks, and I'm good.
Man, this place is great!
It's too bad Donna couldn't make it.
Oh, my God, would you look at that?
We just saw college butt!
On a girl!
- Hold it.
Girls live here too?
- Yes, sir.
We're coed.
-  -  Oh, nice!
That's it!
You're staying with us at the motel.
Wait!
Dad, wait.
Think of what a valuable experience this could be for me.
I mean, this is my first step into the real world.
I'm your little bird, Dad.
Give me wings to fly.
!
Butch it up and get in the car.
Excuse me.
This is your C.P.R. coach.
I'm gonna need to check your lung capacities!
That means their boobs.
There's got to be at least one all-male dormitory on this campus.
Ha!
Here it is.
Right in between the chapel and the School of Interior Design.
Boys, um- um, I realize that, uh I may have been a little irrational today.
- A little?
-  Shut up!
So, um, maybe now is a good time for me to explain a few things to you about menopause.
And, um, lucky for you, I'm a nurse, so I can use the proper terms, like - ''epithelial lining'' and ''uterine wall.
'' -  I'm hooked.
Okay, so.
Um, now.
Say these soaps are my ovaries.
Kill me now.
Can't hear ya, man.
I'm on a beach in Florida.
Okay, um, about a month ago - they stopped producing- -  - they stopped- -  - stopped producing- -  That's it!
What is wrong with you?
Were you dropped on your head?
Yes, I was!
And up until now, everyone had the good grace not to mention it.
- Okay, boys.
Time to leave.
- Yes!
Mrs. Forman?
I'm sorry.
I washed my face with your ovaries.
Get out.
So that's a great beard.
I've never made out with a guy with a beard.
Well, this could be your lucky day.
- You want to go to my room?
- Absolutely.
You know what?
I-I can't.
Okay.
But if you change your mind, a few of us girls will be in the shower.
I can go!
My name is Fez!
Don't pretend you don't see me!
Man, what the hell did I just do?
I just turned down a sure thing because ofJackie.
And you don't know what she's doin' at Marquette.
Or who.
Man, she said she wouldn't do anything.
Yeah, but I bet if she did, you'd cry because you love her.
If you don't shut up, you'll be the first person to touch his chin to his ass.
Have you been spying on me?
I see U.W. has a pretty good C.P.R. program.
It's gonna be my major.
So, I told my girlfriend, ''We can go to separate schools.
'' - I mean, people do that all the time, right?
- Yeah.
My boyfriend goes to school in New York, and we've been together for three years.
- And we're in love now more than ever.
- Of course you are.
And I bet when you two get together, it's like a thunderstorm, right?
Hey, pretty lady.
Hey, excuse me.
Hello?
- Didn't you just say you had a boyfriend?
- Yeah.
But he's not here.
Did you just see that?
I told Donna we could go to different schools and I was extremely wrong, and- Man, if she doesn't hate Marquette, we're screwed.
Who cares, man?
I just turned down a half-drunk college girl.
I'm pretty sure she knew how to do stuff.
Eric?
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
I just wanted to see how you liked Marquette.
And, can I just say, if that snooty switchboard operator's attitude is any indication of the Marquette experience, then-  I can only assume we're crossing Marquette off the list right now.
No, actually, it's great.
Okay, they have this English professor.
He wears a beret and a corduroy jacket, but he listens to Zeppelin!
Uh, yeah, well, U.W. has a vending machine, so-  - Donna, I love you.
- I love you too.
Bye.
You gonna cry now too?
You know who had a real family?
The Waltons.
We're just three strangers sitting in a room!
-  - Donna loves it there.
I don't know what to do.
There's nothing any of us can do.
We're all screwed.
You think I like being stuck here nursing my lunatic wife back from the brink?
Hell, no.
But we can't control what happens to us.
Even if, by some stroke of luck, you actually hang on to Donna eventually, she's gonna turn into that.
And then, a few years later, you'll die.
Good.
Thanks for the bedtime story.
Donna?
I hate it here, and I want to go home.
Wait, what's wrong?
Was there a height requirement for the cheerleading team?
No, it was awful!
And when the cheerleaders were yelling, ''Go, team, go'' all I was hearing was Steven saying, ''Good to know.
Good to know!
'' Jackie, your problem is, is you're always trying to force people into doing stuff.
Oh!
I do not, Donna.
Now, you feel sorry for me right now.
You can't make someone like Hyde do anything.
You have to deal with him the way he deals with you.
Look, pretend you don't care what he does, and he'll come around.
Well, I guess it's worth a try.
You know, being with a real man is complicated.
You are so lucky you're with Eric.
What?
What a wonderful weekend!
We should go away more often!
They gotta make a pill for this.
Oh, Hyde, I've been meaning to tell you.
Hyde and Jackie, sitting in a tree.
They're in love like two monkeys.
Would you shut up, Fez?
That's not even how it goes.
- Well, is it making you mad?
- Yes.
- Well, then, that's how it goes.
-  - Hey.
- Hey.
Look,Jackie.
I know you were worried before so, I just want to let you know nothin' happened on my end this weekend.
I'm not tellin' you that so you'll tell me what you did.
I just want to let you know what happened with me.
That's my report to you.
All right.
Good to know.
- ''Good to know''?
- D-Did I stutter?
- Hi.
- Okay.
I know you love Marquette, and I made my peace with that.
So if that means we're gonna go to separate schools and drift apart and make out with guys named Ted, then- That's just the way it's gonna be, because you're gonna get menopause and I'm gonna die, and we can't control anything that happens to us!
- I'm not going to Marquette.
- Well, then never mind.
I mean, Eric- I loved it, and when I was driving home I was so excited to tell you about it and then the drive took forever.
And I realized, that's how far away I'd be from you all the time.
And I don't want that.
So I'll just tell my dad I want to go to U.W. with you.
Donna, you have no idea - how happy you just made me.
-  Eric, this is gonna be great!
We're gonna be together all the time.
Oh, um-  -you're not gonna get all clingy, right?
-  - Shut up.
- Now, come on.
I'm gonna be a big college man.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna need my space.
What do you want?
Once again, the explanation is pinned to my lapel.
''Dear Mr. and Mrs. Forman.
Please give Michael $30 ''for the game you threw out the window and broke.
Signed, my parents.
''  Well, you made her laugh.
That's worth 30 bucks.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
What are those?
Oh, Donna.
Did you buy Playboy for me?
No, they're college brochures.
Donna, these people are fully dressed.
That's just not gonna work for me.
My guidance counselor gave them to me but I already told him I'm going wherever you go.
How did I ever get a girl as great as you?
- You know you can do better than me, right?
-  - But you're right next door.
It's so easy.
- Right.
Oh, you two make me sick.
Looks like my mom, but speaks like my dad.
I-I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
That wasn't me talking.
That was- That was-That was the menopause.
No, you don't have to apologize.
We totally get what you're going through.
Well, thank the Lord!
Fertile Myrtle totally gets it!
- I miss the basement.
- Yeah.
Kitty, I know these past few weeks have been hard on you- hard on all of us, really.
But especially hard on you.
I mean, since you found out you were- Just say it, Red.
Barren.
Well, there's no need for both of us to say it.
So I got somethin' to cheer my girl up.
Oh, good, 'cause I finished off the last bottle this morning.
No, no.
I got you a puppy.
He needs someone to take care of him.
- His mother got run over by a car.
- Did you run over a dog, Red?
No!
I just hate to see you sad, and I thought- Oh, forget it.
I'll take him back and go to the liquor store.
Well, now wait.
Wait.
He's kind of cute.
Can I hold him?
Oh-ho-ho!
What a little lover boy!
Ooh!
- See?
He likes you.
-  Ah, how about that?
He's got menopause too.
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna go get out of this thing.
- Oh, boo!
- Selfish!
Man, what is with you guys and this uniform?
It makes us want to corrupt you.
Man, Donna is so awesome.
She can afford to go to any school she wants but she wants to go where I go just so we can be together.
Yeah, she is awesome.
Why is she with you again?
'Cause a good girlfriend accepts her guy no matter what.
Jackie was always trying to change me.
''Grow up, Michael.
'' ''Act your age, Michael.
'' ''Stop shooting grandmother with a water pistol, Michael.
'' She's 92, Michael.
She had jam on her face!
Well, all I know is things with me and Donna are going really, really well.
This is just about the point where I screw things up.
- So don't screw it up.
- Fez.
Oh, Fez.
If history has taught us anything, it's that screwing up is my nature.
But you know what I can do is bank a little goodwill- do something nice.
-  - Buy her a present.
Yep, she deserves it too.
Do you know how many times I tried to grab her boob on the way to California?
And it would've been easier for her if she would've let me!
'Cause you know me.
I won't stop.
I gotta get Donna something really special something that reminds her that even though I'm an idiot I'm an idiot who loves her.
I got it!
A scented candle!
Chicks can't keep their shirt on around a scented candle.
Please, the battlefield of love is littered with guys who give candles.
It's expensive jewelry or nothing.
Look, if you can't put a price tag on love then how do you know how much it's worth?
Jackie, what kind of crap is that?
- You haven't learned a thing from me.
- Wait.
Steven.
Well, what do you mean?
I mean, romance was created by corporations to prey on losers who think buying nice things will make somebody love them.
If you ever read anything besides what-  Donny Osmond puts on his waffles, you might learn something.
I put whipped cream on my waffles too.
I eat like the stars!
-  - Hey, when did you get the cute little wiener dog?
No, no, no, no, no!
Not in my chair!
Red Forman!
Schotzie is a helpless, little animal with four breakable legs.
You can't throw him around the room like you would Eric!
Red, you don't seem like the type of guy who'd get a dog being that you're unfriendly.
Yeah, I know.
I just wanted to do something to cheer Kitty up.
Well, if you really wanted to cheer her up, you should've bought her a banjo.
A banjo, Bob?
You can't hold a banjo and not smile.
You can't hold a potato chip and not smile.
Yes?
Um, I want to buy a present for my girlfriend you know, that lets her know how I feel about her.
Oh, no problem.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
Would the, uh, lady like a necklace?
Huh?
- Well, it's- it's nice.
- Yeah.
- It's a little- little creepy.
- Mmm.
Um, it doesn't really say what I want to say though.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh.
- How about a promise ring?
- Oh, don't even - get me started on promise rings.
- Really?
Like, once I gave her one, and she didn't even want it.
- But then she gave me- - How about that.
Look how that shines.
Oh, that's nice, huh?
Uh.
Well, your finger hair - curling over the ring is kind of ruining it for me.
- Oh.
Does, uh, wearing the merchandise usually work for you?
I don't know.
I'm new here.
I used to work at the lingerie store.
- They fired me.
- Ah, yes.
Ah.
I think I know what you're looking for.
Mm-hmm.
How about a diamond ring?
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
Look at that.
- Whoa.
That's an engagement ring.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in high school, man.
That says, uh, too much.
Well, why don't you tell me what it is you wanna say?
That I love her and we should be together forever.
An engagement ring says that verbatim.
Well, too bad, 'cause I ain't buyin' one.
Well, I refuse to put on any more jewelry!
Well, thank God for that!
- Would you like to look around a little more?
- Sure.
And sorry about what I said.
- You look-You look really nice.
- Oh.
Donna.
You, me, tonight at the water tower.
Make yourself foxy, 'cause you're getting something pretty special.
Really.
A present?
I will get foxy.
Oh, and Donna?
Donna, don't forget to wear flats so that Eric can feel like the boy.
So, Forman, you finally broke down, huh?
- What'd you get her?
Earrings?
A little bracelet?
- No.
I got her way more than a piece of jewelry.
I got her a gift that really says something- a diamond engagement ring.
As a joke?
No.
You guys, I'm gonna ask Donna to marry me.
As a joke?
The stupid helmet?
Why do I have to wear the stupid helmet?
Because you're stupid!
You can't ask Donna to marry you, man!
Why not?
I mean, come on.
We already know that we're gonna be together forever.
No, you think that you're gonna be together forever.
Remember how you were worried about screwing things up?
This your Bay of Pigs, man.
Yeah, even in my country we weren't stupid enough to get married in high school.
And we eat bugs!
Forman, what the hell are you thinking?
You don't understand, okay?
I love her.
I was down at the store and I realized- What am I waiting for?
We're happy.
You don't get engaged when you're happy!
What's the point?
You do it when your back's against the wall and there's no way out like if the girl's pregnant.
It is settled, then.
Eric will get Donna pregnant.
I will oversee the proceedings for verification purposes.
Ah, but he's so stupid, how do we know he can do it?
-Jackie, help me out here.
- Well, I think it's beautiful.
Well, then you're crazy too.
Look, Steven.
I am my own woman, okay?
I'm allowed to have opinions about jewelry, you present hater!
Listen, you guys.
I've thought about this a lot, okay?
Donna's willing to commit four years of college to me.
I wanna commit too.
Forman, I say this to you as a friend that likes to see you get hurt.
If you don't take that ring back right now you are going to end up in a world of misery and pain.
Hey, I love Donna, okay?
So, did it ever occur to any of you that I'm ready for a world of misery and pain?
Think about that!
Who wants the last piece of salami?
I'll take it.
Who wants the salami?
- I said, I do.
-  There you go, Schotzie!
I said, I wanted that.
But he was begging, Red.
We don't turn down beggars.
Do we, Schotzie?
No, we don't!
Okay, you guys know more about relationships than my moron friends - so I have a question about me and Donna.
- No.
No more about you and Donna.
You need to be thinking about your future- college, getting out of my house.
But Donna is my future.
Honey, we know you love Donna but you two are so on again and off again.
You're probably gonna be off again sometime soon.
Won't they, Schotzie?
Yes, they will!
How about a career?
Have you even given thought to what you're gonna do with your life?
- Yes, Donna and I- - I think he should be a pharmacist.
Now there's an idea.
You can count.
There's no heavy lifting.
You oughta see him try to wrestle with that big mop down at the store.
-  - I don't see what any of this has to do with me and Donna.
Oh, honey, but you would be such a good pharmacist.
Your slender fingers are perfect for picking up tiny pills.
Aren't they, Schotzie?
Yes, they are!
Did you see that?
He just nodded.
Man, everyone's down on me and Donna getting engaged-you guys, my parents.
Even the Magic 8-Ball said, ''Outlook not so good.
'' I just- Lo- I really think Donna would love an engagement ring.
Oh, she'll love the ring.
It's the thought behind it that'll send her running for the hills.
Or, maybe she'll see how smart it is to get married when you're still in high school and have no money or future.
I know I ran when Jackie wanted to marry me.
'Cept I ran for California instead of the hills.
I mean, the beach kicks the hills's ass!
I mean, there's way more bikinis, and they usually have a snack bar!
What if you guys are right?
What if she thinks I'm moving too fast?
Man, giving her this ring is a huge gamble.
Am I man enough to make that bet?
No, no.
The answer is no.
You see, Forman?
You tried to do a nice, thoughtful thing, and you screwed yourself.
It's all about expectations, man.
Like, I've taughtJackie to think I'm rude and inconsiderate.
I can't disappoint her, because I'm always disappointing her!
And if I don't give Donna the ring, what are we gonna do at the water tower?
Oh, God!
I do deserve this!
Does anyone else think that Schotzie looks like Fez?
That dog is flyin'!
Well, I don't know what's gotten into Schotzie.
He's so hungry, he went through three cans of food.
Didn't you, Schotzie?
Yes, I did!
Hey, Bob, hand me that remote there, will ya?
No, thanks, Red.
I'd have to buckle my belt.
Well, buckle your belt anyway.
No one wants to see that.
Oh, not again!
There we go.
What the hell?
Oh, crap!
That's it.
That damn dog's gotta go!
I think he just went, Red.
- Are you laughin', Bob?
- Your bottom's all wet.
That's just plain funny in my book.
Well, he can't stay.
He's makin' everyone miserable.
I don't know.
Kitty's seemed pretty darn happy the past couple of days.
- Yeah, well- - Look, Red.
You did a nice thing.
Don't spoil it by, you know, being yourself.
I guess if the incontinent little bastard makes Kitty happy I'll put up with it.
What the hell?
I've never been that happy anyway.
At least, not since I've known you.
Yeah.
Weird coincidence, huh?
Okay.
Look, you.
I've been thinking about all your conspiracy mumbo jumbo about presents and diamonds and buying me stuff.
And I realized that all your paranoid, delusional crap about romance is just a cover-up for you being cheap!
Okay, first of all, it's not paranoid, delusional crap.
Advertisers spend billions to make you think I'm a jerk if I don't buy you jewelry.
And second of all, you're right.
I am cheap.
Well, you'd better quit it.
Because I like to get stuff especially shiny stuff.
Would you settle for a cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil?
Well, for you I will.
But just know that I'm really lowering my standards.
That makes two of us.
Come on.
So?
Huh?
This is romantic, huh?
It's a little more romantic in the summer or any time not below freezing.
- So what am I getting?
- What are you getting?
What are you getting?
This is what you're gettin'.
- A candy bar?
- Well, half a candy bar.
I figured, uh, you know, we could share it under the stars.
What a delightful moonlit snack.
Okay, you're being weird, and it's freezing out here.
Aw, come on.
It's not that cold.
- Uhh.
-  - Eric, why are we up here?
- Okay, I'm sorry, Donna.
I had something that I was gonna give you, but I realized it was stupid.
Or everyone said it was stupid, so I just decided against it.
- Well, what was it?
- It was nothing.
Well, it was something.
I mean, I can see that it was something.
-Just tell me.
- Okay, fine.
I was gonna give you this.
- Oh, my God.
Is that a- - Yeah.
Yeah.
It's stupid, right?
- Yeah.
-  And no.
I don't know.
What would you have done with it?
Well, I don't know.
I guess I would have told you how beautiful you are and that you mean everything to me.
And then I would've gone down on one knee you know, like this.
And I would've taken your hand and taken the ring- Go ahead.
and I would have put the ring on your finger like this.
Wow.
So, uh- So, I'll tell you what.
Uh, why don't I just hold on to that until you know, until the real moment comes.
Oh, sure.
Or I could hold on to it.
- You could?
- Yeah.
Eric, I love you, and I wanna be with you forever.
Yes.
That's what I told everyone and they made me wear the stupid helmet.
So, um - did we just get- - I think we did.
Donna, I love you.
- We are so stupid!
- I know, right?
Oh, hey.
Here comes your dad.
Put the ring in your pocket.
- Why?
He'll be happy for us!
- Oh, yeah?
Hey, Mr. Pinciotti, what would you do if I, say -made a long-term commitment to your daughter?
-Oh, I'd kill ya.
You know what?
A secret engagement is even more romantic.
And more stupid.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
I love this ring.
I wish we could tell people that we're engaged.
You know, without Red killing you.
Red kills happy things.
It's what he does.
Let's just enjoy the fact that someday you are going to be Mrs. Forman.
Mrs. Forman?
You want me to go by Mrs. Forman?
Well, yeah, I just assumed.
I mean, come on.
Pinciotti?
- Which is nice.
No.
Which is really nice.
-  Eric?
Eric?
Honey could you get the Thanksgiving turkey out of the freezer?
Oh, wait.
It's a 20-pounder.
Donna.
Could you get the Thanksgiving turkey out of the freezer?
Sure, Mrs. Forman.
See?
There's your Mrs. Forman.
Okay.
Yeah, you know-  you're right.
That's gonna be a little creepy.
Well, now I kinda like it.
Call me Mrs. Forman.
- No.
- Mrs. Forman's feeling dirty.
- Okay, Donna- - Come on.
Give Mrs. Forman a big French kiss!
No!
Donna, no!
Okay.
Perfect.
We're all set for turkey day.
And there'll be plenty of room, especially without Laurie.
Has anyone heard from her?
Of course not!
I guess respect and courtesy aren't genetic like my slim hips.
Hey, Schotzie, stay away from my witch sister.
Her and her witch friends have been known to sacrifice small animals.
Oh, and possibly that one asthmatic neighbor boy.
Eric, little Wally moved away.
A six-year-old moved away?
His parents still live in that house.
Mrs. Forman, if it helps, I can inviteJackie to Thanksgiving.
She's bitchy like Laurie.
Mrs. Forman, I would love to come to your Thanksgiving dinner and I'll bring a date and a Hey, guys.
Red is gonna flip when he sees this failing notice.
''To the parent or guardian of Eric Forman.
'' Your son is a complete idiot.
Please kick him out and raise the foreign boy as your own.
Man, all I did was mess up on two math quizzes but Ms. McGee has to be all-  I'm Ms. McGee.
I wear high heels and fail everybody.
What's that?
That's Ms. McGee.
You hardly changed your voice.
Well, sure, I did.
I'm Ms. McGee.
That's just your voice.
- I'm doing an impression.
- Well, you suck at impressions.
- Okay.
Forget it.
- Are you still doing her?
Oh, hey, Red.
Do me a favor.
Sign this, huh?
My gym teacher's failing me 'cause I won't wear shorts.
- Why won't you wear shorts?
- Would you wear shorts?
Fine.
- Thank you.
- So, Eric.
How's school treating you?
You managing to, uh, keep from embarrassing yourself?
Yeah.
Oh, sure.
I've been buckling down just like you said and thinking a little bit more about my future which I believe you also recommended.
Well, it's good to know that 1 7 years of kicking your ass has finally paid off.
Eric, you didn't have him sign your failing notice.
Oh, I don't wanna trouble him with this old thing.
I'll just sign his name myself, because that's how good a son I am.
Okay, careful.
Careful.
Watch the TV.
Okay, this is good.
Perfect.
Perfect.
You.
Why are you here?
You don't even know what Thanksgiving is.
I'm here because my host parents are feeding bums at church.
Charity begins at home, my ass.
- Laurie.
- Hey, little brother.
You're back.
And you're not even eight months pregnant.
- Mommy!
- Laurie.
!
Oh, my goodness!
I knew you'd come.
- Hi, Daddy!
- All the phones broken in Chicago?
No.
Well, see, I had other plans but my date- I mean, business associate- had to go be with his wife.
I mean, other business associate.
I'm doin' good!
Okay, well, you know what?
I'm gonna set you a place right next to me at the big table.
No, Kitty.
I think that seat belongs to Eric.
Me?
At the adults' table?
Are you sure I'm ready?
- But, Daddy- - Maybe before you leave you'll be acting a little more like him.
Yeah!
I'm the favorite now.
Ooh!
Taste that.
Pimp gave ya the holiday off, huh?
Yeah.
He replaced me with your mom.
Now it's Thanksgiving.
Hey, Donna.
You know how my dad's proud of me - for doing so well in school?
- Even though it's a lie, and you're failing math - 'cause you spend all your time with me?
- Yeah.
Right.
That's- That's right.
Well,just now, right now, right in there, right now Red asked me to sit at the grown-ups' table.
Wow!
I hear each person over there gets their own biscuit.
Yeah.
Donna, it's glorious.
Donna.
Donna, I want to tell everyone we're engaged.
Tonight.
Tonight?
Are you sure?
Yeah, I just- I just want everyone to know, you know?
So when the moment's right we'll just-we'll tell 'em all.
This is so awesome!
And then,just in case, we'll run like hell.
- I probably won't wait for you.
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.
That's a beautiful table, Kitty.
Well, thank you, Daddy.
So glad that you and Mom could be here.
Well, we have to eat somewhere.
And, Mom, I know that we have had our ups and downs but in honor of this special day I would like to tell you that I am thankful that you are my mother, and I love you.
Isn't there something you would like to tell me?
Actually, I would like some more tea.
I'll try and slip some booze in there in the interest of a happy holiday.
So, Thanksgiving.
We celebrate the subjugation of an indigenous people with yams and Underdog floats.
Yeah.
I'm mostly celebrating my pretty new dress.
And so much for talking.
May I wet your whistle, grandpa?
Gonna have to say yes to that.
Well, cannot let this go to waste.
When did they get a houseboy?
Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. Forman.
This is my date Carol.
Ms. McGee?
Kelso you're dating my math teacher?
No.
No, no, no.
We're not dating.
We just have a relationship that I thought we agreed to keep a secret?
Well, um, welcome.
Michael, she is 1 0 years older than you.
Oh, no, no.
Nine and five-twelfths.
-  She taught me that.
- Ooh!
- Very good, Michael.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Kelso, how could you bring her?
Oh, relax, man.
She's not going to quiz you or anything.
But if she does, the square root of zero is zero.
She got me with that last night, earned herself a free massage.
Um, Ms. McGee, being that it's a holiday and all there are certain math-related failing-type things I'd rather not talk about.
I hear you.
There are certain things I'd like to keep quiet too.
So if anyone from the school board should ask I came alone, and I left before dessert.
Eric, maybe we should wait on the big announcement now that your math teacher is here.
Oh, no, Donna.
We don't have to worry 'cause she's not my math teacher today.
Today she's a cradle-robbing slut.
- Yea, student-teacher relationships!
- Yea!
Hey, Laurie.
Long time no doin' it.
Maybe for you.
So, what time is your date gonna let you out for recess?
Nice try, Laurie.
There's no recess today.
It's Thanksgiving!
Wow, Laurie.
Yeah, me and her really had something, huh?
Yeah.
Ointment took care of that, though, right?
Yeah.
This looks great.
Here you go.
One for Burt and one for Ernie.
I'm calling you Ernie now because you look like the Muppet.
I didn't ask for a drink.
I didn't ask to be born in a field.
But you fought back against adversity just like your Indian brothers.
What is he, Cherokee?
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
It's time to carve the turkey.
Red.
Actually, Kitty, I think this is Eric's year.
Seems like he's growing up and finally buckling down.
Here you go, Son.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, in that case, I would like to make a kind of announcement.
Check it out.
!
I'm bread man.
Shut up!
Eric's talking.
Go ahead, honey.
Okay.
Well, I'm really glad that my family's here and my friends and, well, even my math teacher.
Because, uh, something happened a few days ago that I'd like to share with everyone.
Eric, we agreed this isn't the time.
- No.
No, I meant- - Not the time for what?
To talk about how he's failing math.
- What?
- Fez, what the hell?
I've been drinking.
Mr. Forman, you did sign the failing notice.
I didn't sign- You forged my name?
Wow.
I really picked the right day to come home, huh?
Okay, um who likes dark meat?
Hey, who doesn't?
Am I right, ladies?
Oh, Lord.
So you lied to me about school.
Now, it wasn't a lie so much as a misdirection, really.
We'll talk about this later.
Well, Laurie, looks like a seat just opened up for you.
Come on over and grab a biscuit.
Forty-two minutes and I'm back on top.
So, that was kind of a mess.
Oh, no.
That's what I wanted to happen.
Burt, honey, pass me your plate.
Burtikins.
- Burt!
- I'm up.
Bob, you know what Eric's problem is?
All that time he's spending with your daughter.
Hey, Donna ain't the problem.
Eric's the one who corrupted her up so dirty, I had to send her to Catholic school.
How could he be failing math?
Kitty, I'm sure he did the best he could.
For someone who was held too long as a baby.
I bet that explains why he hit puberty so late too.
No.
That was because of your mother's smoking.
Fez, I know you've only spoken English for a couple weeks now, but could you have learned the words, ''Don't tell my dad''?
''Don't,'' a contraction meaning ''do not'' and ''tell my dad,'' meaning shut up?
Okay, right there, you just told me not to shut up.
It's a wonder you're not failing English too.
Crack a book, you lazy son of a bitch.
So, guys Ms. McGee.
Pretty nice, huh?
If they put one of her in every classroom I'd never skip school again, if you know what I mean.
I mean, I'm doin' it with my teacher!
Oh, shh!
It's a secret.
I've never been with a teacher.
But I was with the post-office lady.
That was cool.
I got a hundred free stamps and a monster roll of tape.
I like older women.
They always got something smart to say.
I think I could probably fit inside of a record player.
That's gotta sound good in there.
Inside of a record player?
I miss dating Kelso.
The guys I'm with now, they're so- I don't know.
What's the word?
Married.
Hey, you and Kelso didn't date.
You're just a tramp he cheated with.
And you contaminated him so much, I ended up with Steven who I love being with.
So thank you.
Wow.
I'm the only one here who's never been with Kelso.
Which makes me wanna say, ''Ew!
'' And also, ''Thank God.
'' But you, I mean, you're a teacher.
Can't you get in trouble for dating a student?
Hey, let 'em come and get me.
He's 1 8.
I make $1 1 ,000 a year.
I deserve a little something.
So, that was one rootin'-tootin' big, old crap of a day, huh?
Yep.
Pretty much.
I just really wanted to tell people that we were engaged.
Know what?
Maybe it'd be easier if we just showed up next Thanksgiving with a kid.
Hey, thanks for dinner, Kitty.
I'll remember to wear my stretch pants next time.
Oh, let me know if you find that button.
Good night.
I apologize if my being here upset you.
No, no, no.
I- I just feel you being seen out with a student is- it's just awfully bad principle.
He doesn't care.
He's dating a cheerleader.
Burt.
Burtie Bear.
- Burt!
- Grandma, let me.
- Grandpa!
- I'm up!
My goodness, you are going to make some lucky man a wonderful wife!
Oh, my God.
That's where Laurie gets her mean streak.
It's not from delightful me.
It's from my evil mother!
So evil skips a generation.
So that means that my granddaughter is gonna be the devil.
Well, don't worry.
Because no woman's gonna wanna bear your idiot kids if you can't even pass math.
How could you forge my signature?
- Here comes yelling.
- Yeah.
I don't wanna hear this.
I'll help with the dishes.
And I'll take these half-empty glasses.
Okay.
No, no.
You've had enough.
Eric.
What the hell is wrong with you?
He doesn't understand consequences, Daddy.
Well, maybe he'll understand this.
From now on, every time you disobey me or lie to me or do anything that pisses me off you're gonna pay me money.
Pay you?
Wait, you're fining me?
It's like giving him tickets for being dumb.
Okay, okay.
I think we're forgetting about a time-tested punishment.
There's your foot.
Here's my ass.
Swing away.
Well, it obviously doesn't work.
So, for forging my name you owe me 30 bucks.
Daddy, can I borrow $30?
- Sure, kitten.
- Wha- Laurie, your grandparents are sleeping in your room.
So you take Eric's room, and the math whiz can ride the couch.
Well, another Thanksgiving come and gone.
Certainly an eventful day, hmm?
Yeah.
But with our ungrateful daughter that dumb-ass son and a drunk foreign kid, I'd say actually, it was a little better than last year.
- I know we're young.
- But we're totally in love.
And we just want you to know - we're engaged!
- We're engaged!
- Feels good to tell someone.
- Yeah.
I think they're happy for us.
Look, Schotzie's celebrating.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Steven, I'm telling you, beards are out.
Look at Malibu Barbie.
She can date anyone she wants.
But she's with Malibu Ken.
Why?
Because Malibu Ken doesn't have a beard!
Yes, he does.
Malibu Barbie's his beard.
No straight man would wear shorts that tight.
I don't care.
Just shave it off.
It's like making out with carpet.
Well, here it is- the beginning of the end for you two.
Yeah, I remember the part of our relationship when allJackie did was boss me around.
Yeah, that part only lasted- what, like, six years?
And he's a better man for it.
So come on, Steven.
Let's shave that beard.
Jackie, you just gave an order in the form of a cheer.
Oh, where are you going?
Wherever the beard takes me.
Jackie, sweetie, we just got a phone call, and you're needed at home.
So why don't you grab your coat.
Mr. Forman'll give you a ride home.
- Do you know what's going on?
- No.
I don't know anything.
I know everything!
You know how Jackie's father is a city councilman?
Not anymore.
He just got arrested for bribery.
He could go to prison.
Well, I'm glad.
That guy makes Republicans look like a bunch of crooks and greedy businessmen.
Yeah, well, thank God for the honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh?
Oh, no.
What did you say?
I- I said that Nixon was framed, and Kennedy was a commie?
That's right.
What's with the gun, Trigger?
Oh, will you relax, Eric?
It's not a gun.
It's a BB gun.
Yeah, I lost it when I was, like, 1 0, and I found it this morning buried in my backyard.
Why were you digging in your backyard?
Uh, dinosaurs.
Watch the news, Donna!
You guys, I can't believe that Mr. Burkhart might actually be going to prison.
Ah, the tragedy.
My father was sent to prison and it led to a life of drugs and prostitution.
- What?
- Yes.
Then his pimp killed him.
But then the medical examiner found a tiny hair.
And he solved the crime, and he sent the pimp bastard to the chair.
Fez, that was last night's episode of Quincy.
Oh, I didn't know you watched that show.
Yeah, this is rough stuff Jackie's going through.
She'll come runnin' to me- Old Faithful.
Kelso,Jackie's with me now.
Maybe.
But we have history.
So when she needs a shoulder to cry on, she'll rest her head on these broad babies.
Feel 'em.
Rock hard, amigo.
Man, you don't wantJackie leaning on your shoulders.
- They're all bruised.
- Where?
Man, I should really see those coming by now.
Oh!
Watch the gun, Cool Hand Luke.
Will you relax, Eric?
God, guns don't just go off by accident.
Really?
Well, what about Eric's fourth-grade hamster, Snowball?
Oh, no, Snowball wasn't shot.
He went upstate to live with a nice farm family.
You shot Snowball?
Well, the gun went off by accident!
Oh, sweet pea, I'm here for you.
Steven, my dad's going to prison.
What am I gonna do?
Um, bake him a cake with a file in it?
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Look, I just- Oh, never mind.
Now we're talking.
Donna, give her a kiss.
Jackie blew right by me to get to Hyde!
Yes, I know.
Because you told me 20 times!
Oh, there's my boss, Nina.
Queen of the D.M. V. She haunts my dreams.
Wait.
I thought Mr. Roper from Three's Company haunted your dreams.
Oh, he's there too.
Bug-eyed bastard.
Look at how beautiful she is.
You have to help me win her heart.
What ever happened toJackie's heart?
At first I thought they were just killing time.
- But Nina- - But now I actually think they're getting serious.
- But Nina- -Jackie and Hyde- Enough!
It's over for you, pin-brain!
Now, to summarize- Jackie gone, Nina still in play.
Now help me do this thing.
Fez.
Nina.
My ''queen-a.
''  I told you I don't like that.
Now you're late for your fingerprint tutorial, so move it.
Whoo, tough cookie.
Yes, Fez likes the hardheaded mamas.
Really?
I'm starting to get into the Asian ladies.
I know what you mean.
Mystery of the Orient.
Very sexy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Donna, what are you doing wearing the engagement ring?
It's supposed to be a secret.
You didn't tell anyone, did you?
Yeah, Eric, I have no self-control, so I told the pretzel guy at the park.
Okay.
Seriously, I have no self-control, and I told the pretzel guy at the park.
- Donna!
- I'm sorry.
I'm excited.
I had to tell someone.
Plus, uh, free pretzel.
What's wrong, Steven?
Problems with Jackie?
Yeah, I said the wrong thing.
Well, I have menopause.
Do you have menopause?
Uh, no.
Lucky bastard.
I'm sorry.
So tell me what happened.
Well she wanted me to say something to make her feel better, and I couldn't think of anything.
Well, Steven, you don't know how to comfort people, because you've never been comforted.
No, that's not true.
One time, my dad felt so bad about missing my Little League game that he made up for it by disappearing for nine years.
Well, after what you've been through you don't have to be nice to anybody.
Jackie can just leave you alone.
Now I'm just- I'm gonna go upstairs and cry a little.
Problems with Jackie, huh?
Hyde, I'd like to remind you that Donna and I are basically the perfect couple.
We really are.
So we might just have a little something to teach you about relationships.
We really do.
- All you have to do is back off.
- Go to her.
What?
No, he needs to be with her.
No, he needs to give her space.
When your mom left, I gave you space.
I didn't want space.
I wanted you with me.
- You didn't tell me that.
- I couldn't find you!
And they lived happily ever after.
Fingerprinting is one of the most important jobs at the D.M.V., Fez.
It helps make our customers feel like common criminals.
See?
Firm but gentle.
Repeat that: firm but gentle.
Fir- but ge-ge-  Your hands are strong.
But your right hand's much stronger than your left.
Why is that?
Um, I am a sword fighter.
You fence?
Touché.
You know, I'm- I'm sorry if I'm a little short-tempered with you sometimes.
It's just, well, when I see you, I just- No.
No, I can't.
But- But I am all atwitter.
No.
No.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
And no one can know about this.
But, Mom, Dad's in trouble.
So I really think you need to come back from Acapulco now.
Uh-huh.
Wow, that is a lot of tequila.
Red,Jackie's been moping in our kitchen for an hour.
So call the cops.
I don't want her arrested.
I want to help her.
She needs a father figure.
Go talk to her.
- No.
- Yes!
- No.
- Red!
Fine.
Every damn argument!
You'd think I'd win one, just by chance.
- Mr. Forman- - Look,Jackie I know that things seem grim, but your father's rich, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, then I'm sure that whatever trouble he's in he'll buy his way out and wriggle free.
You're right.
I mean, this is America.
The rich are treated differently here.
Yep.
And I'm so glad I took some shrapnel to make that happen.
Me too.
So, Hyde, have you talked toJackie yet?
'Cause don't- 'Cause you gotta give her room to breathe, man.
Yeah.
And if she ever falls out of a plane just let her fall.
What, he's supposed to just jump out after her?
Well, at least they'll be together.
Man, I don't getJackie.
I mean, we were together for years and the second I turn my back, she off and Frenches Hyde.
And by ''turn your back,'' you mean ditching her for two months to have sex with random beach trash?
Whatever, man.
You- It's all- It's all about words with you!
Kelso,Jackie's my girlfriend.
We're together, so get over it.
-  Fine!
-  Dude, you shot him!
That is exactly what happened to Snowball!
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Did I shoot your eye?
Yes!
Now I can't see, you moron!
You're dead!
-  I'd start running now.
- Chasing me is futile!
I'll just hide in your blind spot!
- Man, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
The BB just winged my shoulder.
But that kid needs to be taught a lesson.
Hyde, it was an accident.
No, it wasn't.
He's been bitching about me and Jackie since he found out.
Now he got himself so out of control that he shot me.
I don't like getting shot!
So now I'm gonna punish him the way my parents punish me.
You're gonna leave him at the mall?
No.
I'm gonna milk this eye thing until he feels as bad as he should.
They didn't leave me at the mall.
They forgot me.
They were drunk.
-  - I am in pain.
Fez, we're really sorry about Nina.
You know, rejection hurts.
No, Nina and I were kissing, and she made me stop and now I am in pain.
Ew.
I have to go do something.
I think maybe we're all getting a little too comfortable with each other.
Well, maybe we wouldn't be so comfortable if we just gave each other some space.
- Don't make me hit you.
- Well, good luck reaching me through all the space.
Hey, guys.
Is Hyde here?
Hyde?
Hey, Hyde.
I brought you this.
What is it?
I can't see.
Well, it's most of a burger.
I took a bite, 'cause I'm sorry, but I'm also hungry.
Yeah, well, it's almost 2:00.
I gotta go flush out my eye.
You guys, how bad is it?
Is Hyde gonna be a cyclops?
Kelso, what were you thinking?
I mean, did you shoot him on purpose?
No!
The gun went off on accident!
Well, he kinda thinks you did.
How could I?
I mean, yeah, I was mad.
But I didn't- I don't know.
Maybe I did it accidentally on purpose.
- You mean subconsciously?
- No, I was definitely awake the whole time.
Steven, I'm glad your eye's not hurt.
Even though you deserve it because you were such a jerk about my dad.
Man, look,Jackie-  I'm never gonna be the guy who says the right thing at the right time.
Okay?
I'm just not.
You are so full of it.
All I'm asking for is a gesture, and you can't even do that.
Okay, I got something.
Get your dad a carton of cigarettes so he can trade 'em for not being someone's wife.
- Oh,just forget it.
- No.
No.
Jackie, that's funny.
Look, when my dad went to prison, that's what someone told me to make me feel better.
It was my mom!
We had a real good laugh!
Mr. and Mrs. Forman, can you settle this for us?
If someone you love is kinda depressed should you shower them with kindness or give them space?
Well, now, that's a very good question.
And it really takes a lot of living with someone to get it right.
- That's true.
- But you'll find the thing to do is- - Give them space.
- shower them.
What did you say?
I said what you said.
You're lying.
Oh, come on, Kitty!
When menopause makes you crazy I could be with you all day and it wouldn't do any good.
You need space.
Oh.
Menopause makes me crazy?
I'm crazy?
I'm crazy?
Well, if you want space, Red Forman, you got it!
This crazy lady's out the crazy door!
We were having a nice lunch.
Okay, Hyde, I feel really bad, and I shouldn't have shot you.
And I think that I might've done it on purpose 'cause I'm not okay with you and Jackie and I don't know if I ever will be.
But I'm almost positive that I'll never, ever shoot you again.
But the only way to be sure is for you to shoot me.
I've always responded really well to corporal punishment.
So, here.
Do it.
Shoot me.
This is like Old Yeller.
Come on, man.
Just do it.
Right here.
It's the only way.
Okay.
- You lied!
-   You're dead, man!
So, how's stuff with your dad?
Well, my mom's flying home from the Fiesta de las Margaritas so I guess it's pretty serious.
Wow, that is serious.
Playboy voted Fiesta de las Margaritas Latin America's number one singles party.
But I-  I'm sure she's just there for the margaritas.
Oh, my God, you guys, my whole world is just falling apart.
Oh.
Hey.
Steven!
You shaved your beard off!
.
- I thought it might cheer you up.
- Oh, my God.
You shaved it off for me.
You let the razor say the words your mouth couldn't speak.
-  Aww.
- Shut up!
So I guess the answer to the problem wasn't more or less space.
It was more or less hair.
And that's bizarre.
Okay, I've been thinking about it- about the space thing, and I got it.
You'll talk about stuff, and I'll just leave.
And I'll follow you.
Because I'm strong enough to take you down and make you listen.
And I will let you lie on me and pretend that it bothers me.
Guys, something horrible has happened.
The little man in my pants has turned black.
It's not funny!
Black is the color of death!
Oh, my little man is going to die before he gets to see the world.
I'm so sorry.
How could this happen?
How?
Okay, I washed.
But the ink isn't coming off my little man.
Help.
You should try bleach.
- Ooh.
Or Comet.
- Yeah.
Or steel wool.
Hey, and if all else fails the one thing that gets out ink is more ink.
That's right, Hyde.
Whatever you do, use the steel wool first.
Really scrub so the soap gets in there.
Remember, if it doesn't sting, it's not working.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Guess what.
Nobody guess.
It's always about boobs.
Oh, come on.
Don't you want to know what I have to say?
Man, I never know what you have to say.
I mean, in your head you're speaking English but when it comes out, it's all buzzes and clicks.
Oh, really?
Well, I guess I was speaking English to the S.A.T.'s because I got 1 ,000 points.
Oh, and last night on cable I saw four boobs.
Wait.
So the S.A.T.'s are in?
Donna, did you see your scores yet?
- Yeah.
This morning.
I got a 1 230.
- What?
A 1 230?
That's great.
Why didn't you say something?
Well, I didn't want to brag.
I mean, yeah, I kicked ass, but it's no big deal.
Eric.
Eric, honey.
I got the mail and your S.A.T. envelope happened to be open and the letter just sort of slid into my hand and I accidentally put on my reading glasses, and I saw your score.
You got an 800.
I got an 800?
That's it?
''That's it?
'' If one hundred's an ''A,'' eight of them is an A-plus-plus.
No.
No, Mrs. Forman.
An 800's not good.
I mean, a pigeon can peck a better score than that.
Really?
Donna did better.
Fez did too.
And his whole country's made of bamboo.
This is awkward.
I'll just, um- I'll go home and take down the streamers.
Forman, the S.A.T.'s prove nothing.
I got a 950, and I don't even have any textbooks.
Or a locker.
Wait, wait.
A 950?
Steven, I knew it.
You do have potential.
Yeah.
Imagine what I could do if I only applied myself.
Oh, well.
Guess we'll never know.
I just- I can't believe I got the lowest score here.
Oh, Eric, someone had to come in last.
There is no shame in that.
Well, there is a little shame.
Shame on you.
-  - Hey.
You know, who cares what anyone got?
It's just a stupid test.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't care.
- I got a 1 030!
-  -  - Yeah!
I did good on a test, man.
Something's happening to me.
I'm blooming like a flower.
Whoo-hoo!
So the S.A.T.'s proved it.
Donna's the smart one.
Eric, on the other hand- Well, I don't wanna say there's a dumb one but there's two, and he ain't the smart one.
That's where you're wrong, Bob.
Eric got an A-plus-plus.
Oh, uh no, see, uh, Red it turns out Eric still did very well.
It's just, some other people did better.
- Donna?
- Yes.
- Steven?
- Yes.
Not the foreign kid.
Yes.
Kelso?
Yes.
He did worse than Kelso?
I watched that kid glue his hand to his face.
You.
What happened on the S.A.T.'s?
Okay, you know he's not good under pressure.
He can't pee in a public restroom because there's an audience.
You know what?
This is a family thing.
I'll leave you to it.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm not smart.
- Who says you're not smart?
- You.
When?
Always.
Your problem is you got your head up your ass.
Your father's afraid that you're spending a little too much time on a high school romance.
That's right.
Donna gums up the works.
Whoa.
It's not her fault, okay?
I was prepared for that test.
I had three sharp pencils.
That's one more than recommended, by the way.
I remember sitting there, filling out the little bubbles-  - Well, that was a blast.
- Sure was.
Now why don't you point yourself toward my villa and park this thing in my garage?
Oh, I'm planning on that, but what should I do with the car?
We better hurry.
We only have five minutes.
Well, that's four more than I need, baby.
I repeat: There's only five minutes left in this section of the test.
Oh, my God.
Donna does gum up the works.
See?
Now use what little brains you've got and hit the books, dumb-ass.
Kelso, what the hell are you doing with a book?
Reading.
I am reading.
'Cause what good is having brains if you got nothing up here?
- Hi.
- Hey.
So I saw my dad in prison today.
Oh.
How was it?
Well, at first it was a downer but then I realized that I'll be okay without my dad because the S.A.T.'s prove that there's another man who can take care of me.
You better be talking about Santa Claus.
No, Steven, I'm talking about you.
Because you have potential.
He doesn't have potential.
I have potential.
Like, I'm reading Moby Dick, and I'm not even halfway through and I can already tell you the ending.
The whale is a robot.
Steven,just imagine what your life would be like with the love and support of a good woman.
Oh!
Thank God for your strong S.A.T.'s.
Now we don't have to be poor.
Not poor, indeed.
Basic math and verbal skills are the ticket to great wealth - and therefore great happiness.
- Oh.
Poor person!
Bring me a fancy cocktail.
It is my privilege to wait on you, madam.
Oh, quite so, quite so.
All right.
Enough with the idle chatter.
Go be poor.
Wait.
Someone's playing the harp in the corner?
'Cause if I'm rich, I'm hiring, like,Jethro Tull.
Who cares?
It's the same thing every time- I'm a butler, I'm a bellhop, I'm a stable boy.
Well, I've had enough.
I will not wait on you people anymore.
Got it?
Good.
Now who wants a Popsicle?
Wow.
Here's something I did not know.
They number every page.
Hey.
You guys.
You know how Red's always telling me I need to buckle down?
It turns out he's right.
I do have to buckle down.
You sure do.
He's got an 800.
There's your butler.
Man, how can I ever marry Donna?
I mean, I'm an idiot around her now, and we're only engaged.
What?
Oops.
- You're engaged?
-  No.
How could you give her that ring?
You're in high school, man, and according to the S.A.T.'s that's about as far as you're gonna go.
Look.
Just don't tell Donna I told you, okay?
She'd kill me.
It's supposed to be a secret.
Of course she wants it a secret.
''I'm marrying dumb guy.
'' Who wants that spread around?
You know, maybe Eric's bad score is a blessing.
It'll be a good story when he's a senator.
''Senator''?
The word you're looking for is ''janitor.
'' Okay, see?
That's why Eric did so poorly on that test.
It's because you're too hard on him.
I have to be hard on him, 'cause you always baby him.
- Because you're so hard on him.
- You babied him before I was hard on him.
- Because you're so hard on him.
- You babied him before I was hard on him.
You were hard on him when he was a baby.
Hey, I just found out I can take the S.A.T.'s again.
I'm gonna- I'm gonna take it again, and I'm gonna nail it.
I just gotta buckle down.
I'm gonna kick a little S.A.T. butt.
- Attaboy.
- Good for you.
Think he'll do any better?
- Eh.
- Yeah.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Studying.
I'd love to hang out, but I've really gotta buckle down.
All right.
Can I raid the fridge?
My dad wrote ''Save for Bob'' on all the food at our house.
Oops.
I dropped the margarine.
Butterfingers.
It's so slippery I can barely get my fingers around it.
Uh, I gotta go.
- Ground me.
- What?
I am not strong enough.
If I'm gonna shake this Donna thing I am gonna need some serious discipline.
Please ground me.
You got it, pal.
You're grounded.
One more thing.
Donna's in the kitchen.
- I need you to get rid of her for me.
- Do I have to be nice about it?
- No.
- This is the happiest day of my life.
Hey.
Hey, Steven.
Great news.
I found a couple savings bonds - and I can cash them in to help you pay for college.
-Jackie-  You're going to college?
I am so happy.
You were an orphan, and we took you in.
And now look at you.
I'm proud of you.
And that money that you've been paying in rent?
I put it in a bank account for college.
Or bail.
But this is better.
Okay, enough.
Jackie, college is a waste of time, and I'm not going, okay?
- So just butt the hell out.
- No.
No, Steven, I won't butt out because you need to be pushed, and we need to think about our future.
Look.
Even if we have a future, it's not gonna be what you wanted.
It's gonna be more like- Steven, do you think I'm fat?
I know you're fat.
Go get me a beer.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
It ain't pretty.
Please tell me they won't be living in our basement.
Well, we'll be dead by then.
Oh, good.
You grounded yourself?
What?
Why would I do that?
Well, apparently, I ''gum up the works.
'' Oh, good.
So someone filled you in.
Yeah.
Red-when he kicked me out of your kitchen.
And then he locked the sliding door and stood there laughing and waving.
Eric, why are you freaking out about this test?
I'm not.
I'm gonna take it again, and I'm gonna nail it.
Anything less than a 1 2 40 is unacceptable.
A 1 2 40?
Hmm.
That's 1 0 more points than I got.
Really?
That's weird.
You're threatened because I got a better score than you.
- I just- I have to do better than you.
- Why?
Because I'm the man, and the man's the man and that's just the way it is.
What did you say?
Uh- I'm grounded.
Dad!
Donna's up here.
- That's it.
- What's it?
This chapter just helped me figure out the answer to you and Donna's problem, vis-a-vis your crappy score.
''Vis-a-vis''?
It's a PBS word, Eric.
Stay with me here.
Yeah, I liken your situation to that of Pavlov's dog.
You see, Pavlov was this science guy and every time his dog would ring a bell, Pavlov would eat.
Are you sure it was the dog who rang the bell?
Yeah.
I mean, who else would it be?
Pavlov?
Well, that wouldn't be a trick, Eric.
What man can't ring a bell?
Anyway, every time that dog would ring that bell old Pavlov would eat, and then he would drool.
You just read that chapter two seconds ago.
- Do you even want my help?
- No!
Your loss.
Okay.
So what's wrong with you and Donna?
She did better than me on that test and I'm sorry, but that is just not gonna fly because I am the man and the man's the man, and that's just the way it is.
Well, honey, everybody has different skills.
I do better on tests than your father but he's the one brave enough to kill spiders.
And since we've been married, how many tests have I taken?
None.
How many spiders has your father killed?
Hundreds.
But, Mom, spiders freak me out.
We all have different qualities.
But the thing to remember is how you do on some silly test is much less important than how you behave in real life.
I'll take a dummy over a jackass any day.
So am I a dummy or a jackass?
Well, honey, right now you're both.
Okay, Steven, about your vision of our future with you swilling beer and me being fat?
That's not gonna happen, because I'm not gonna be fat.
It's genetic.
That's true.
Her mother drinks two bottles of wine a day and she looks damn good.
No, I've seen her vacuum in her underwear.
- So what's your point?
- My point is she's frickin' hot.
Not you.
All I'm saying is that I've become accustomed to a certain lifestyle and if you would just live up to your potential- I don't know why you're talking to 950 guy over there.
I got a 1 030.
I got 80 more potential.
Yeah, but Steven has my heart- Which is why I want him to be rich.
I mean, think about all the stuff you could buy for me.
Jackie why don't you earn your own money and buy those things yourself?
Myself?
And I'm not like Forman.
I have no problem mooching off your success.
You know, you leave the room, I steal some money from your purse.
You pretend I didn't, but we both know I did.
That's the future I see for us.
Oh, Steven, that's beautiful.
Oh, wait.
So you don't even care that I did better than him?
Not really.
Well, if being smart isn't gonna help me impress the chicks then I want no part of it.
I'm gonna go back to coasting through life on my good looks.
Hey, and my brains will always be there so if I ever need 'em I'll just whip 'em out and use 'em like a secret emergency rocket pack.
That's a good plan, man.
Hey, it beats the hell out of reading.
- Okay, Donna, look.
- Don't worry, Eric.
I'm only reading the funnies.
Business section's for the man, right?
Donna, the thing is, I'm a jackass and I know it.
Well, I know it too.
Look.
Okay, the only reason I said what I said is- You agreed to marry me before the facts were in, right?
So now I'm thinking that maybe, you know you might want to trade up.
That's so stupid.
Okay, I swear to God, if one more person calls me stupid today- Eric- Eric, my entire life everywhere I've gone and everything I've done has been better because you were there with me and no test score is gonna change that.
Wow.
That was amazing.
Did you come up with that yourself?
Well, I saw Mr. Ingalls say it to Mary on Little House on the Prairie.
- Hmm.
- I just made it a test score instead of blindness.
But I- I still think it's true.
So, you're still glad we're engaged?
Of course.
Good.
Hey, speaking of Little House- Did you ever see that one where Laura accidentally told Kelso, Hyde, Fez and Jackie that she was engaged to Donna?
Eric, are you kidding me?
God.
You can't even keep a secret?
Hey, Donna, I got an 800.
We're lucky I can wash myself, okay?
Poor person!
Where's my drink?
Where's your drink?
What about my drink?
Next time you ask where your drink is, it will be in your ass.
It's so hard to get good poor people these days.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Why would Sports Illustrated even publish an issue that's not a swimsuit issue?
You know who should do a swimsuit issue?
Playboy.
Why would you put clothes on a centerfold?
Sometimes I get tired of all the complete nakedness and I like to be teased a little.
Yeah, there's a lot more going on up here than you know about.
I think there's some stuff going on in there that you don't know about.
You guys should have come to the arboretum with us.
We saw plants and trees from all over the world.
There was a bush from Morocco.
Smelled like chocolate chip cookies.
Ah, that is the perfect bush.
Thanks for taking me to the arboretum.
It was fun.
Yeah, what a great day.
What a horrible day!
I don't mind looking at some trees, okay?
When they put little signs on them, with little Latin names- It makes me want to harm myself.
- So the missus took you out for some girl fun, huh?
-  See, Donna is hot, but she is mean.
My girlfriend Nina?
Just hot.
You know, Fez, you talk a lot about this Nina chick, but none of us have ever seen her.
Yeah, we're actually starting to suspect that she is some creepy alter-ego you visit late at night in front of the mirror.
Oh, no, I don't do that anymore.
But Nina is the real deal.
Kelso saw her at the D.M.V. Uh, there were a lot of girls there.
She could have been the one with the lazy eye that does the vision test.
Lazy-eye Lizzie?
No way.
She wouldn't even look at me.
Nina, my friends don't believe that you're my girlfriend, even though I Frenched you.
Girlfriend?
I don't know if we're there yet.
I mean, I like you and all, it's just that all the guys at the D.M.V. seem great until you find them in your apartment wearing your hot curlers.
Warren.
I want to get to know you better, meet your friends make sure they're not puppets.
Warren.
So, if they are not puppets, then would you be my girlfriend?
Mmm, it would definitely help.
-  - Are these lines open or not?
- Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
- That was very unprofessional.
So, we're finally gonna meet the mysterious and possibly fictional Nina!
Fictional?
Does this hickey look fictional?
Huh, looks too small to be from the vacuum cleaner, like last time.
Wait, let me see.
Small, blotchy and uneven.
Ah, this girl's an amateur.
Let me see.
Small, blotchy and unpleasant.
Yeah, this girl's a Jackie.
Well, Fez, I am thrilled that you found a girl 'cause I was startin' to worry.
But you've proven me and the experts from Reader's Digest wrong!
When I introduce her to everybody, I just want it to be special.
Oh!
Let's have a formal dinner party tomorrow.
You know, it was at a dinner party that I first realized Red Forman was more than just a boy with great hair.
Sounds good, Miss Kitty.
You might be a little past your prime, but your mind is still sharp.
Oh, actually tomorrow night's not gonna work I thought we might go see Laser Floyd.
Well, you tell this fellow Floyd that you have a dinner party.
No, Mom, Laser Floyd's not a guy Laser Floyd is Pink Floyd music- with lasers!
Lasers, like in Star Wars.
!
Mrs. Forman, we'll be here.
Wait.
You'd rather go to a formal dinner party?
Sure!
Sounds great.
And, uh, don't forget, Mrs. Forman.
You can count Steven and me in.
Yeah, I've been looking for an excuse to buy him a shirt with buttons.
Since it's a special occasion, you're all allowed one sip of wine.
Great!
It'll be like Communion, but without the fun of church.
So, Steven, you know, I was thinking of getting you a pair of beige corduroys and maybe a blue blazer for the party.
Oh, don't forget the matching scarf and gloves.
This way, I'll be nice and toasty when hell freezes over.
Uh-oh,Jackie.
Looks like Steven doesn't wanna wear his big-boy clothes.
No, I don't wanna go.
You should have asked me before you said I would.
Steven!
I am your girlfriend.
I speak for you now!
Well, then, tell yourself I said to bite me, 'cause I'm not going.
Oh, you are so going!
So just bite yourself!
.
-  - Man, do you believe that crap?
Tell me about it.
Donna wants to go to a dinner party, we go to a dinner party.
If she wants to go to the arboretum, bang, I'm in a room full of trees.
God, I hate trees.
So tall and arrogant.
So why don't you just not go?
- Oh, it's just one day.
- Not for you, man.
You're engaged.
It's Latin for ''screwed for life.
'' Oh, my God, you're right.
And I have no choice.
I have to do what she says or she won't let me touch her naughty places.
- Hyde, this is extortion!
- You're tellin' me?
I'm bein' shaken down by a 95-pound brunette with pink toenails.
Kitty?
I know this change of life has upset you but we just bought wine the other day.
What are you doing, brushin' your teeth with the stuff?
Red, it's not for me.
Well, this one is.
We're having a dinner party tomorrow night.
No, can't do it.
Battle of the Network Stars is on!
See, once a year, they make TV stars compete at things they're not good at.
I look forward all season to watching Ed Asner try to paddle a canoe.
Makes me feel superior.
Well, you shouldn't feel superior, because you know what I know about Ed Asner?
Ed Asner would come to my dinner party, 'cause he knows how to treat a woman.
Did you say ''dinner party''?
See, I thought you- Oh, screw it, I'll be there.
What's this about a party?
Oh, well, we're having a party tomorrow night for Fez and Nina.
- I invited all the kids.
- I'm a kid.
Well, it's for couples only.
You can come if you bring a date.
Well, it's too late to find a date.
I mean- Yeah, I'm sweet looking, but I'm no miracle worker.
Well, maybe if you stop jumping from girl to girl, you wouldn't be alone.
You're no Frank Sinatra, you know!
You know, you used to be nice, but you've changed, lady!
Guys, I really want Nina to like me so please, avoid the following topics: my addiction to candy the fact that I have needs and my use of Alberto VO5 Hot Oil Treatment.
Wait.
Fez, what does she care what you use on your hair?
Oh, I do not use it on my hair.
Well, heard about your secret couples party.
And I'm glad I'm not goin', 'cause I hate parties.
Hey, man, I'm only goin' 'cause Donna's makin' me.
At this rate, the only way I'll see Laser Floyd is if they project it on a leaf canopy at the arboretum.
So, don't go to the party.
Act tough, Forman.
- I'm not tough.
- That's why I said ''act.
'' No one's making me go, that's for sure.
Oh, that is it, Steven.
As your girlfriend, I am ordering you to go to this party.
And as your boyfriend, I'm ordering you to take your bossy mouth and flap it elsewhere.
If you flap it at me, I'll go with you.
You hear that, Steven?
Michael wants to go to the party with me.
- I'm not going to the party.
- Fine.
Michael, I would love to go to the party with you.
Kick-ass!
I love parties!
Okay, now.
These are called after-dinner conversation cards.
Let's try one!
''If you were a bird, where would you fly?
'' Donna?
Um, south?
I don't know, I'm nervous.
I feel like I'm on Jeopardy.
If I were a bird, I'd fly to Laser Floyd.
I'd fly to Tahiti, 'cause the girls there don't wear tops!
Wait, but then I'd want to change back to myself because no lady wants to make it with a bird.
Wait, can I be a monkey?
Okay.
Nina!
I'd fly to my favorite place, the D.M.V.!
I was just going to say that!
Red, we haven't heard a peep out of you.
If I was a bird, I'd fly into a ceiling fan.
Steven, you came, just like I thought you would.
- You buckled!
- No, I got hungry.
You're in my seat.
Damn, Hyde, now everyone knows it's a clip-on!
Since you two work at the D.M.V. how about you make this parking ticket disappear?
We can't fix this.
You parked in a fire lane.
Oh, Nina, please.
We're his guests.
I will take care of it, little buddy.
- No, Fez, he broke the law.
- Broke the law?
- I was just getting some milk.
- What if there was a fire?
Then I'd pour my milk on it.
Okay.
Okay, let's try another card.
Um, ''If you could be anyone's shoe whose shoe would you be?
'' I wouldn't want to be Red's shoe, 'cause I think it's about to go in someone's ass.
That's it!
I'm watching Battle of the Network Stars.
I'm with you.
Have fun with Mr. Clip-on.
Yeah, you know what?
Me too.
- You're leaving?
- There are lasers going off right now!
Perfectly synchronized lasers!
And all of a sudden, you're, like- like, Lady Dinner Rolls shaking me down with her naughty places!
I'm going too.
Apparently we can eat a man's food, but we cannot fix his ticket!
Well, what happened to my dinner party?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Forman, but Marilu Henner only gets on the trampoline once a year and I'm not gonna miss it.
Where the hell does Eric get off acting like I make him do stuff?
It not like I wanted us to come to this dinner party either!
I only did because well, you're all menopause-y now, and you scare me!
Right, you came for me.
Just like I slaved over a pot roast for all of you.
You want a definition of Hell?
Try opening a 400-degree oven while you're having a hot flash.
We're all here for someone else.
And you know why?
It's right there in front of us, girls.
- Women are giving.
- I'm not giving!
I'm here for me.
Steven is the one who should think about others.
- I mean, how could he just ditch me?
- Well,Jackie it might have to do with trying to boss him around - then showing up with Kelso.
- She's right.
I know she's right.
But you're not a part of the group, and I don't like you, so zip it!
Man, look at you guys, all forced to hide in the basement because of your women.
Hey.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
I finally set Donna straight.
Alls you did was babble about lasers and naughty places.
Man, I thought you were having a stroke.
Whatever, man.
You caved just likeJackie wanted.
I didn't cave.
Just wanted to make sure ''Don Juan el Tardo'' here kept his hands off her.
Then how do you explain the necktie?
I just came from a business meeting.
At least he's putting up a fight.
You just gave up.
Like France.
Oh, get off his back, little buddy.
You were at the party too.
Hey, I fought the good fight for 30 years.
Now I just agree with what Kitty wants to do, so I can go to sleep.
And I'm not your ''little buddy.
'' Yeah, you're all doomed.
That's funny.
No, we're not all doomed.
One man here still has a chance.
One man can take a stand for all of us.
And that man's name is- Well, we can't pronounce his real name, so we call him Fez!
I don't want to take a stand, I just want Nina to be my girlfriend and give me nooky!
Fez, come on.
Give it a try!
It'll be like Battle of the Network Stars.
Think about it.
Welcome back to the Battle of the Gender Stars - where it's the gals with 50 points!
-  And the guys with zero.
But the guys still have a chance 'cause the final event is conveniently worth 51 points.
You guys are pathetic!
Wow, that's some tough talk,Jamie Farr.
I'm switching to the gals' team.
I can do that, because I wear a dress on M.A.S.H.
Okay, now let's meet our contestants.
- Representing the gals: the lovely Nina!
-  - And representing the guys: the lovely Fez!
-  Yes.
Fighters, go!
Make that dame eat some mud!
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
We're going antiquing all weekend!
Oh, like hell we are.
I hate antiquing.
Let's do this thing!
That's right.
Gentlemen, let's go get our cojones back!
I gotta see this.
- Hey, man, you coming?
- Nah, I still have my cojones.
My lonely, lonely cojones.
Oh, look who it is.
You bake a brownie, and the bastards come running.
I'm afraid your brownies are powerless now.
Fez has something to say.
Fez.
- Can I have a brownie?
- Fez!
Oh.
Right, right, right, right.
Nina, I insist you take care of Red's ticket, because I am in charge.
- Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
- Okay.
- Man, what the hell?
- I have needs.
Nina, if I do everything you want, would you be my girlfriend?
Can't say no to that!
I cannot believe it!
I have a girlfriend!
So when do we do it?
- I am not speaking to you.
-  Well, at least it will be quiet enough to go to sleep.
Okay, Donna, when we came up here, Fez was supposed to- Donna?
Oh, crap.
Hey, Steven, look.
Remember how you said that I was bossy?
Well, I think you were right.
So, from now on, if I want you to do something, I'll ask first.
- Well, I just- - Shh, I'm talking!
I am so sorry.
There I go again.
Okay, here's what I wanted to say: Would you like to go with me to the Girl Scout Alumni Pancake Breakfast?
Jackie, I'd rather put on a dress and slow dance with Kelso on Soul Train.
But since you asked nicely, I'll go.
Yea!
Oh, uh, Steven, don't forget to bring a spatula because I signed you up as a flipper.
Hey, the flipper better be the guy who judges the Alumni Bikini Contest!
It's not.
- Donna- - Wait, let me guess.
-  - Laser Floyd, Laser Floyd arboretum, dinner roll, Laser Floyd.
- Okay, listen.
- No, you listen.
I don't know what's wrong with you- if it's genetic, or if you took a pill from your mother's cabinet- But I'm through doing stuff for you, because you don't appreciate it.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're doing stuff for me?
Yeah!
I went to that dinner party to make your mother happy and I went to the arboretum because you wanted to.
I wanted to?
All I said was, ''Look, the arboretum.
'' W- It sounded like you wanted to go.
I hate trees!
I mean, ''Ooh, show me trees!
'' Does that sound like me?
- No.
Look, I'm sorry.
-  I just- I thought you were gonna make me do girlie crap for the rest of my life.
Eric, come on.
You know me way better than that.
Yeah, you're right.
So, would you like to go see Laser Floyd next weekend?
Oh, we can't.
I signed us up for this class: ''Quilting for Couples.
''  -  I'm kidding!
-  It's just for men.
And the canoeing champion for this year's Battle of the Network Stars is Red Forman!
- My team!
- Thanks,Jamie Farr.
And I'd like to give a special thanks to Ed Asner.
Ed, thanks for paddling your canoe like a girl.
Where's your spunk now, you big pansy?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Here you go, Red: Belgian waffles.
- What's Belgian about 'em?
- They crumble at the hands of the Nazis.
This bacon is so amazing.
Makes me regret calling girls pigs all my life.
Why is the loud one eating my breakfast?
Well, her father's in prison and her mother's in Mexico.
See, this is what I don't get about your dad.
If you're arrested for bribery, can't you just bribe your way out?
I mean, you're a briber.
That's what you do.
My dad is broke.
I mean, in fact, the bank foreclosed on our ski cabin.
Everything's gotta be moved out this weekend and it's all up to me.
And I'm just so very small.
Well, I'd like to help, but not as much as I'd like not to.
Too late.
Already packed an overnight bag.
Kitty, why is it we always do what you wanna do and never do what I wanna do?
It's in the Bible.
Well, have a fun weekend, Pops.
Oh, you're coming too, pal.
And there's gonna be heavy lifting.
You better bring Donna.
Jackie, why can't Hyde help?
Oh, that's right.
He's your boyfriend.
I guess that's punishment enough.
Now, I've been with Steven long enough to know the best way to keep our relationship going smoothly is by never asking him to do stuff.
So instead I told him I'd be out of town this weekend for a big doll expo.
Oh, there's a doll expo?
Man, I've been lookin' for Jungle-fightin' G.I.Joe.
He's got vine grip and poisoned darts.
''Poison not included.
''  I left mine out in the rain.
He got jungle rot.
I- I had to amputate his foot.
- Okay, so you got plans this weekend?
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.
All right, good, 'causeJackie's at a doll expo so I'm thinkin' you, me, Kelso sneak up to her cabin drink beer till we all look pretty.
Great.
Let me get rid of this customer.
Next!
- Read the top letter, please.
- It's an ''E.
'' No!
Fail.
Move along.
Wh-What are you talkin' about, man?
That's an ''E.
'' 'Kay, I'll give you one more chance.
Read the top letter, please.
- ''E.
'' - No!
Double fail!
Double fail?
You made that up.
This, my blind friend, is a capital ''E.
'' The double fail stands.
Hey, wait a second.
Aren't you the guy that got caught in the school shower with the lotion and the Playboy?
Pass, pass.
Double pass.
- Now, stay with me.
- Yeah.
I'll be right on your bumper.
- Don't tailgate.
- I'll keep a safe distance.
Don't lollygag.
- What do I even say?
-Just smile and nod.
Don't smile and nod.
You look like an idiot.
- You know, I'm kind of excited about this road trip.
-  We've been talkin' about fooling around in some place new and different- -  -you and me alone in a car on a country road after dark?
Yeah.
And hey, if I don't get lucky with you, we're bound to run into a farmer's daughter.
Hmm.
This is great: no broads, just us guys.
We can really get to know each other.
Fez, you try and lure me in the hot tub, and I'm kickin' your ass.
I'm just saying, we're all so tense.
Well, we won't be for long.
Last time I was here, I hid a stash.
Just gotta remember where I put it.
I know it was someplace I could fit my hand.
- Well, that rules out your face.
- What?
Ow!
Am I distracting you, my big, strong driver man?
Not at all, my lonely hitchhiker.
Well, how did you get your foot all the way over here?
You can thank my dad for the ballet lessons.
I will be sure to send him a fruit basket.
Wait.
Wait a second.
Donna, when did that U-Haul we've been following turn into an ice cream truck?
- Oh- Oh, man.
We lost Red.
- No.
Wait, we can't be that far off-trail.
-  - Let's look atJackie's directions.
Okay.
''I-43 to Highway 60.
Head east when it gets different.
'' - ''When it gets different.
'' What the hell does that mean?
- Wait.
Let me see that.
''Go a ways past the fancy thing and turn left at the ugly house.
'' Oh.
Well, if the ''fancy thing's'' a dead cow, then we're almost there.
Hey, Kelso, did you find the stash yet?
No, there's nothin' in the kitchen I can fit my hand in you know, except for the garbage disposal.
Well, I'm going to the corner to buy some beer.
Do not get in the hot tub without me.
-  - Man, it's like- -  - that stash is probably starin' me right in the face.
Oh!
Ha!
Yeah.
It wasn't someplace I could fit my hand.
- It was someplace that could eat my hand.
-  - Hey.
There's a truck pullin' up to the cabin.
-  - Oh, it's Red!
- Is it a fire truck?
The truck's not red.
The guy is Red, man.
It's Red Forman.
- Not it.
-  What?
No, I said, ''Not it.
'' If playground rules aren't in effect, this is anarchy.
Okay.
Jackie's directions say, ''Pass the place I bought a green sweater.
Don't stop.
The cotton has polyester in it.
'' This is great.
We're lost.
No, we're not lost.
We just need to find our bearings.
Where would she go around here to find a green sweater?
Why, the green sweater store, Donna.
Good thinking.
Hey, why are you mad at me?
I- Because you need to learn to control your urges.
If you'd have kept your big foot outta my bean bags, we wouldn't be in this mess.
Well, excuse me for reading Cosmo and trying a little somethin'.
If you think you're gettin' the topless nachos now, you're crazy.
Whatever.
Ah, man, now I'm hungry.
I want my Twinkie.
- You packed Twinkies?
- I packed a Twinkie.
There's only one left, and it's mine.
Whoever packed it, snacked it.
- I've been lookin' forward to it all day.
- Oh, you have?
That's nice.
That's- That's very ladylike.
-  - Eh.
Jackie and the Formans are here.
And we're not supposed to be here.
And this is illegal.
We're busted.
No, you're busted.
I'm out the bathroom window.
What?
Get off of me.
Welcome to the cabin.
- What are you doin' here?
- Yes!
Well, you scared me.
I thought you were a robber.
Now I really need to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, there was no window in there.
Steven, what are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me?
Oh, my God.
You heard about the foreclosure and you knew I lied about the doll expo, so you came up here to help me move my stuff.
That's exactly what I did.
And you found me out.
Oh, Steven, I completely misjudged you.
I mean, somehow you've become the boyfriend I always hoped you could be.
And shame on you for doubting me.
Hey, I got beer and Pixy Stix.
Let's party.
Hey, we said no broads.
Why do you need alcohol?
Is that beer really gonna make your lives better?
- Not if you don't let us drink it.
-  Shut it.
Now, let's clear this place out.
If we hurry, I don't have to sleep here.
I hate nature.
Oh, God.
Steven, you know what?
I thought you finally understood what being a couple was about.
Well, what is being a couple?
It's all about give-and-take, yin and yang.
It's a philosophical paradox like a tree falling in the forest with no one around to hear it.
Does it make a noise?
Who's to say?
Okay.
You're just confusing me.
You see?
It's murky.
That's what I'm up against.
Oh, my God.
What a load of crap!
Who's to say what crap is?
-  - Here.
Pull my vase.
Oh.
I know this one.
No, thank you.
No.
Man, it's stuck.
I put the stash in here, and now I can't get my hand out.
Oh, I can help.
Oh, damn.
I guess I left my Baby Oil in the other pants.
-  - This vase smells like chocolate.
Really?
Aah!
You can't see it, but I'm flippin' you off right now.
-  - What's goin' on?
Oh,just a classic case of hand stuck in vase.
Well, get it off, or you'll have a classic case of foot stuck in ass.
-  - Hey, what's the teeny writing on the bottom of the vase say?
- What teeny writing?
Aah!
-  Stop doing that!
Get smarter!
Steven, would you be careful?
That's my trophy for Prettiest Ballerina.
Oh, but that's right.
You don't care about stuff that's important to me.
Hey, you know what?
You're the one who lied and said you were going to a doll expo.
- Should've just told me what's goin' on with you.
- I shouldn't have to tell you.
Okay?
You should just know.
- So- -  I'm just supposed to magically know that ''I'm going to a doll expo'' is Jackiespeak for, uh, ''My parents' cabin is being foreclosed on.
I need help cleaning it out''?
Yes.
Steven, my family is falling apart, and you've never, ever even asked about it.
If you cared, you'd figure out what was goin' on with me and find a way to help.
Jackie, that's crazy.
The only time people I know find a way to help is when they're cuttin' a deal with the D.A.  -  - Whatever happens, you're drivin' her back.
She talked so much on the way here I thought I was gonna have to strap her to the hood of the van like a deer.
Boy,Jackie looks mad.
Yeah.
I cheated on her, like, a hundred times, and she never looked that pissed.
Come on, Kelso.
Grab that end of the couch.
I've had it with that vase.
I'm gettin' a hammer.
Oh, come on.
What the- Why won't this thing come off?
Like, my hand wouldn't be so big if I didn't have to hold this stupid bag.
You're holding the bag?
Just-  let go, you moron!
Fine.
Wow.
It's like the world's greatest pinata.
What the hell happened here?
Steven what's in the bag?
The Packers winnin' next year's Super Bowl- That's what's in the bag.
Is that what I think it is?
If you mean paprika, yes, sir!
Honey- Honey, paprika is red.
If you mean green paprika, yes, sir!
Green paprika?
Hyde, what am I lookin' for here?
Oregano.
If you mean oregano, yes, sir!
Did Jackie say anything about Davis Street?
Not unless it's ''the street where I dropped my gum that time.
'' All right.
That's it.
We're goin' home.
-  - And, Donna, I'm sorry about what I said about your urges.
I love your urges.
They've been very good to me.
Hmm.
Thanks.
They do what they can.
Um, I'm waiting for my apology.
- For what?
- For that Twinkie you inhaled?
Are you serious?
Okay.
I'm sorry I ate your Twinkie.
You rolled your eyes.
It doesn't count if you roll your eyes.
- Okay.
I'm sorry I ate your Twinkie.
- Wh-You rolled your eyes again!
- It was just a stupid Twinkie!
- It was my Twinkie, Donna.
It was my Twinkie.
Do you idiots realize how much trouble you're in?
How can that bathroom not have a window?
Wh-What's goin' on?
Well, apparently Hyde had a stash that none of us knew anything about.
Especially me-  though I think Fez knew too.
That's the way you want it?
Fine.
You have to sleep sometime.
Okay, shut it.
I'm calling your parents.
I'm calling Immigration.
And you- I warned you once about this crap.
Now I have no choice.
You're outta the house.
- No, wait.
Look, that stash wasn't his.
It was mine.
-Jackie- - Let me talk.
- Yeah, Hyde.
Let her talk.
Okay.
Look, it's just- I've been having such a hard time since my dad's been in jail that I was looking for anything that just might make me feel better.
Mrs. Forman, it's like you with your menopause and all that wine you're always drinkin'.
No.
Well, you shut your dirty, little mouth.
Now, Steven, you tell me the truth right now.
Is this yours or not?
Mr. Forman, I'm telling you the truth.
It's not mine.
Okay.
Fine.
Well, I don't care whose it is.
I'm throwin' it in the lake.
What?
I paid 20 bucks for that.
You got my parents' number.
That'll teach you to sell me out, you son of a bitch!
All right.
All right.
All right.
Let's go.
So, I snuck up here behind your back we have a huge fight, and then you do something nice for me.
It's like when the Grinch stole Christmas, but all the little Whos sang anyway.
I don't know.
It's just what people do for the people they care about.
- Nobody I ever knew.
- That's 'cause you were poor, and poor people are bad.
But, look, it's like what I was talkin' about before.
I sensed you were in trouble, and I look for a way to help you without you having to ask me.
Jackie, to be fair, you heard Red say, ''Hyde, you're out of the house'' not ''Hyde, you're going to a doll expo.
'' - Well, anyway, thank you.
- Mmm.
- Oh, so can you help me move the mirror in the bathroom?
- What mirror?
The one covering up the window.
- Ah.
That was a great trip.
- Yeah.
Can't wait to do it again.
Okay.
Okay.
Donna, I think I may have overreacted a little bit.
I mean, there are plenty ofTwinkies in the world.
I mean, sure, there was only one in the car, and you did go Godzilla on it but look, I'm sorry.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, it didn't taste very good.
- I think it was a knockoff.
- Yeah, my mom buys ''Twonkies.
'' Look, Donna, we had a goal at the beginning of this trip.
We were gonna be romantic in some place new and different and I am a man who likes to finish what he started.
So may I suggest on my kitchen table?
Wha- You know what?
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, your parents won't be home until tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
You're going for this?
Okay.
Okay.
Great.
What the hell was in that ''Twonkie''?
-  -  You believe that kid?
First he doesn't show up, then he blocks the driveway.
Well, I will just be happy to get back in our nice, quiet house.
- Oh, my God!
-  Oh, my God.
!
All right.
It's Donna's butt.
Damn it!
That's where I eat dinner!
Scrub, damn it!
I am scrubbing as hard as I can.
This cleanser isn't strong enough.
Kitty, it's bleach and lighter fluid.
There is nothing stronger.
Well, it is not strong enough.
- Nope.
No good.
- We need a new table.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Okay, Fez, now remember.
The bra wants to come off.
It can't be forced.
It has to be coaxed.
And go.
And they are out!
Eight seconds!
That's a new foreign exchange student record!
- And I think she liked it.
- Okay.
That was good, but remember, the real girl will have a head and, hopefully, arms.
Hey, guys!
Have I got a surprise for me.
Annette!
Yeah.
Annette came all the way from California to visit me because we're in love.
Yeah, since Hyde stole my old girlfriend-That's him.
Then I remembered Annette, and, well, I gave her a call.
One thing led to anoth- Well, hello there.
So, Annette, when you get bored with this one I can take off a bra in eight seconds.
Well, maybe more if you fight me.
All right.
Back off, Fez.
What me and Annette have is real.
Which is amazing because I even told him that I used to be flat-chested and have a different nose.
Yeah, and I figured she looks okay now, so what the hell?
So, anyway.
Annette, you'll be staying with Donna.
Um, what?
No, no.
It'll be fun.
It'll be like having a giant Barbie to play with.
Yeah.
I mean, come on, Donna.
You guys were great friends in California.
Friends?
The most I ever said to her was ''Yeah, those probably do hurt when they're sunburned.
'' Well, I need someplace to stash her.
Yeah, I got a footlocker in my room.
Please, Donna.
I already had to take a shower at Michael's house and one of his brothers took a picture of me.
Kelso, I thought all your brothers were out of the house.
Uh must've been a burglar.
So, that's the tramp Michael fooled around with in California.
The nerve of him bringing her into The Hub.
I mean, people eat here.
Hey, will you stop talking about how jealous you are of Kelso's new chick?
Oh, I am not jealous but I would like to point out that the sign on the door says, ''No dogs allowed.
'' Donna, can we go to your house?
I have to change into my afternoon outfit- gauchos and clogs.
Bravo.
Um, you have an afternoon outfit?
Of course she does.
You can maybe use a little freshening up too, Big D. - Eric, do you mind?
- I'm on it.
Ow!
- Donna!
- Why don't I meet you guys by the car?
Come on, Michael.
While we're waiting, I'll let you smell my hair.
Yeah, well, I just got these fries.
Fine.
Then I'll go flirt with the gas-station guy.
Fine!
God.
How hot was that?
Wow.
You know when you have a dirty dream?
Well, Annette is the girl who's always in it.
Oh, she should be ashamed of what she has done to me.
I don't know.
I didn't mind her in California but now that she's got her hooks in Kelso, something's different.
Yeah.
Something evil.
I just can't put my finger on it.
Michael, I'm waiting!
I was getting you a SuperBall.
Damn!
I told you, I don't like presents that bounce.
Did you hear that?
The shrill voice.
The bossy tone.
The random hatred of all things that bounce.
Oh, my God.
She's Jackie.
- A new Jackie.
- A blondeJackie.
''Blackie.
'' We are doomed.
Well, I can't spend the night alone with that.
Jackie, you have to sleep in my house.
Ooh!
Good idea.
Put both Jackies in the same room.
Toss some lipstick in the middle watch 'em tear each other to shreds.
No.
No, no.
I don't wanna sleep over.
- Well, I don't like her.
- Come on.
We'll do, like, girlie things.
It'll be like a pajama party with makeovers.
Donna, I'm not interested in stupid girlie things.
- Look, I'm not shallow anymore.
-  Don't do that when I'm eating.
Jackie, come on.
You'll have all night to chip away at her self-esteem.
We can whisper about her and when she asks us what we were talking about we can giggle and say, ''Nothing.
'' Oh, wait.
I've done that to you.
That's where I got it.
Okay.
Okay.
Here's what I think would teach her a good lesson.
Dress her up like a Swiss mountain girl, us fellas will come over make a couple of daiquiris, get a little tipsy, see what happens.
What?
Okay.
That's not a very good punishment.
We should spank her too.
- I don't hear any kids.
- They're at The Hub.
So, we have the house to ourselves.
Interesting.
Don't open it.
I'll throw in a foot massage.
It could be The Franklin Mint.
I ordered those Gone With the Wind plates.
Mom, Daddy.
I told you not to open it.
- What are you doing here?
- We just thought we'd drop by.
You came all the way from Phoenix just to drop by.
Oh!
So you're lost and you need directions back home.
That's no problem.
Go south until you see cactus.
If you hit a guy with a sombrero, you've gone too far.
Okay.
Okay.
- Why are you really here?
- Well, we had a reversal of fortune.
- Tell them what happened.
- I bought an ostrich farm.
Tell them what else happened.
It was next to a coyote farm.
Great story.
See you at Christmas.
He lost all our money.
We had to sell the house in Phoenix, which is why we're here.
An ostrich farm, Burt?
Who the hell wants to eat an ostrich?
Coyotes, apparently.
You see what I live with?
Well, I'm sure Daddy was just doing what he thought was best.
- You could show him some sympathy.
- Him?
What about me?
It's always difficult for the beautiful women.
You never understood that, Kitty.
Jackie's acting really strange, man.
I think she doesn't like Kelso having a new chick.
No.
Jackie's acting strange, becauseJackie hates Annette becauseJackie and Annette are the same person.
And that's scary, 'cause there can only be one devil, one Hitler, one Darth Vader.
That's not it.
Something's going on, and I don't like it.
Like, you think, maybe she still has feelings for Kelso?
I don't know, but it's bad, man.
I got the same feeling I get right before I shoplift something.
Oh, it's an old story.
Orphan boy falls for rich girl.
Doofus shows up with whore.
Rich girl goes back to doofus.
Fez consoles whore, sexually.
And orphan boy ends up alone, slowly going blind from self-abuse.
Too far?
I had a feeling it was too far.
What are you guys doin' sitting here when the girls are having a pajama party right next door?
Oh, I can just imagine what's going on over there.
No, no, Fez.
I got this one.
I know.
Let's have a pillow fight- Even though it's hard to do when I'm encumbered by all these clothes.
Jackie!
Take off my nightie.
Not yet.
I wanna practice kissing.
Just kissing?
Or can we rub up against each other too?
Well, Annette, you can't have one without the other.
Yea!
Yea.
You know, it occurs to me that you can see right into Donna's house from my driveway.
You don't say?
I'm gonna go get some CrackerJacks.
She's so cheap, she could be the prize in the CrackerJacks.
Wow.
You're jealous.
I am not jealous.
I just wanna pop that inflatable bitch and watch her fly around the room.
Look, here's the thing,Jackie.
Kelso likes bossy, vain, shallow princess types and since you're no longer available, he shipped one in from out West.
He's not supposed to replace me.
He's supposed to sit around and pine for me.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
Oh, my God!
It is always about food with you.
It's like you're not even listening.
Okay.
New rule for slumber parties: Annette wears a robe.
No, Annette, not the robe.
Quick.
Somebody yell, ''Pillow fight,'' in a girl voice.
- Forman, that's your cue.
- What are you boys lookin' at?
- We're just testin' out the crates.
- For charity.
Right.
But now that we're done, let's head inside, gang.
- You coming?
- No, I told your grandmother I was comin' outside for a cigarette.
- Grandpa, you smoke?
- Nope.
So, um- So- So did you guys hear about that woman who might be the first female member of the Supreme Court?
No.
I did hear the Dallas Cowboys might hire their first redheaded cheerleader.
Ew!
That's exactly what I said.
Uh-oh.
Redhead in the room.
-  -  - What are you guys talking about?
-  Nothing.
- Burt!
Burtikins!
-   Burt!
Eric, would you please go find your grandfather before my head explodes.
You are all such nice boys.
I have a quarter for each one of you.
Thanks, Grandma B. - Someone call an ambulance.
- What's wrong?
Grandpa's on the ground.
He's not moving.
They got ice cream in the cafeteria!
Ice cream?
Kelso, my grandpa's in intensive care.
Yeah, but I told 'em it was my grandfather so I got the ice cream for free.
- Put it down.
- Fine but when my burrito's ready, I'm eatin' it.
Why does everybody go everywhere with us?
Look at all these damn kids.
I feel like a Mormon.
Man.
I feel like we should know something by now.
That is the third coffee break that doctor's had.
Hey, buddy!
Quit the coffee, fix the sickies, all right?
Hey, who took my ice cream?
Oh, sure.
It's always the foreign guy.
Fez, you're holding the spoon.
Oh, sure.
It's always the foreign guy with the spoon.
Kitty, how's Burt?
Well I don't know how to say this.
Daddy's gone to a better place.
Good.
'Cause this hospital sucks.
What?
Oh.
This hospital sucks.
Mrs. Forman, I'm so sorry for your loss.
The service was lovely.
Aw, geez.
Aw, geez.
- Aw- - We got it, Bob.
Mom, how you doin'?
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Mom.
Your husband, my father, is gone.
You're not fine.
You're right.
I think I chipped a tooth on your manicotti.
When I die, get a caterer.
Hey, man.
Sorry about your grandpa.
I didn't know him, but there's a Carly Simon song that always cheers me up.
-  - No, you don't-  - Oh, that's great.
-  What do I do?
Do I clap?
I'm just gonna walk away.
That was awesome.
Do you know ''Devil Went Down To Georgia''?
No, Michael.
She's got better things to do.
Hey, come on!
Let's go try on people's coats.
So, the rich girl goes off with the whore.
That's a happy ending.
Put it on ice and you got yourself a show.
Yeah, soJackie and Annette are friends now?
I guess I don't have anything to worry about.
Never count Kelso out.
He's got a way about him.
You know, when he talks to you, it's like you're the only one in the room.
You're, like, half in love with him, aren't you?
Hey, Eric.
I brought you half a beer.
Well, it's mixed with half a Coke, 'cause Red caught me.
- So, are you okay?
- Yeah.
I guess.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- I'm really sorry about your grandfather.
I mean, right in your own driveway.
What was he doing out there anyway?
He caught us spying on your slumber party.
You were spying on us?
Eric!
We- Okay.
If anyone should be mad, it should be us because, lady, you do not know how to throw a slumber party.
Flannel pajamas?
What are you, a hundred?
You need a nightie?
I'll buy you a nightie.
So, am I allowed to drink around you guys yet?
Eric, put that back.
That's your mother's emergency wine.
So, um, Mom, you haven't said much.
Are you holding it in?
'Cause it's okay to let it out.
We're family.
If anybody needs to let anything out, I'd be happy to leave.
It's just so typical of Burt to make everyone come up from Phoenix in the middle of winter.
He never thought about anybody but himself and those damned ostriches.
Did you hear that?
That is not grieving.
Okay, Kitty.
Calm down.
It's not as bad as you think.
Maybe you're just having a hot flash.
Oh!
Dad, no.
Eric I need you to get to the wine.
Father's thoughtless.
I'll tell her who's thoughtless.
What is it?
I, um,just wanted to see if you wanted another blanket.
Yes.
That would be very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Mom.
Dad wanted me to give you this.
Donna, great news.
I'm not jealous of Annette.
I thought I was, and I was afraid that I might still have feelings for Michael.
But I got to know her and now I really like her.
That is such a relief because, you know what with Burt dying, I was worried about you.
- Yeah, me too.
- That was sarcasm.
Well, whatever it was, it was very thoughtful.
It is such a relief knowing I don't have feelings for Michael.
Get off my boyfriend!
Oh, yeah!
I don't know why she's so upset.
I was barely touching you.
Okay.
This one's for Burt.
And a-one and a-two and a- -  -  Bring it home, brother!
-  -  Night-night.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Okay, let me get this straight.
After my grandpa's funeral, Kelso and Annette are making out.
Jackie sees them and yells, ''Get off my boyfriend''?
Right in front of you?
Yeah, it brought the whole funeral way down.
Hyde, that's horrible, man.
You know what's even worse?
I totally missed it.
Yeah?
Well, nobody else missed it.
Half the frickin' town was there.
Today at The Hub, you know that kid Jimmy with the headgear?
He said he felt bad for me.
Jimmy Headgear felt bad for me!
I knew it was a mistake hooking up with Jackie, and I did it anyway.
You know why?
'Cause she makes you stupid.
I bet Kelso was composing symphonies before her.
Hyde.
Man, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
'Cause whatJackie did to you was embarrassing.
You must be so embarrassed.
I told a lot of people what happened and they all agreed that it was just really embarrassing.
Kelso, now is not the time.
I just wanna buck our boy up, 'cause what happened to him was so embarrassing!
That's it.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Whoa, whoa!
Why don't we go upstairs.
We got that new JCPenney catalog.
There's a full-color section on bras.
Word has it the airbrush guy totally missed a nipple.
I don't know why he's so mad.
I was just being sensitive!
Well, be sensitive to me because I'm upset too.
If you expect me to go to the Valentine's dance tonight -you're gonna have to do a few things for me.
- For you or to you?
Shut up!
One: You will not speak toJackie.
Two: You will not speak to girls who have brown hair likeJackie.
Three: You will not speak toJackie.
Wait.
I got messed up.
Yeah, baby, whatever you want.
Just- Man, it's great being under someone's thumb again!
What did your mother do to you?
Man, I just feel bad for Hyde.
I mean, Annette wants me.
Jackie wants me.
My good looks are ruining people's lives.
Well, Hyde seems pretty mad.
Whatever, man.
I'm not afraid of him.
-  He got away.
!
- Help me!
So have you talked to Hyde about the whole ''get off my boyfriend'' disaster?
No.
And why is everyone making such a big deal about it?
Every time I walk into a room, people look at me funny.
Donna, how do you deal with it?
Jackie, the reason people are making a big deal about it is because it sounds like you still have feelings for Kelso.
Well, I don't.
I think the only reason I said it was because I was having an allergic reaction to the Forman's cheap generic soda.
Oh, no!
A giant redhead!
Please don't crush me!
Ple-e-ease!
Fez, would you stop screwing around.
Now, did you finish the balloon walkway of love yet?
You bet I did.
When Nina sees it, she's gonna be so impressed her balloons will become my walkway of love, if you know what I mean.
Fez, that's disgusting.
Oh, no, the giant's angry!
Run for your life!
Run!
Run!
- Mrs. Forman, this chili is great.
- Thanks.
Daddy used to love my chili.
Remember, Mom?
I remember it gave him the toots.
Well, that's a nice place to start reminiscing.
So, Eric, are you excited about your big Valentine's dance?
Yeah.
I'm just glad it's in the gym.
There's nothing like celebrating the most romantic night of your life in the room where I got my first wedgie.
It meant I liked you, Eric.
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk about my father.
Well, Kitty, we can dwell on what was or we can talk about what is.
If I've learned anything from losing my Burtie Bear it's that all that really matters is making sure that the people we love know we love them.
Mom, that was wonderful.
I mean it.
Eric, I love you.
Oh.
Well, thanks, Grandma.
Kitty.
I think I'll go for a walk.
Well, this was fun.
I'm gonna go to bed for a few days.
Oh, no.
She hasn't done this since Elvis died on the crapper.
Now I've gotta sit by her bed for four days and tell her that she's beautiful.
It's hard to say that to a cold-cream-smeared loony in bunny slippers.
I remember that week.
The shades were drawn.
The food supply ran low.
We were sucking on bouillon cubes to stay alive.
Yeah, but did you hear what your grandma said about love being the only thing that matters?
- Eric, we should tell her that we're engaged.
- What?
She could be the one person who'd be happy for us.
We're gonna need someone on our side when we tell our families.
Yeah.
And you know what?
Even if she's not on our side the minute Grandma thinks it's a bad idea my mom will be booking the big room at the Holiday Inn just out of spite.
So, it's a win-win.
Yeah.
We're gonna do what Luke Skywalker was too afraid to do- use the Dark Side to our advantage.
Eric, if we're gonna be married, you really gotta ease up on the Star Wars stuff.
All right?
It doesn't apply to everything.
I'm gonna have to rewrite my vows.
- My favorite song?
- Uh, ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.
'' The light I look best in?
Uh, it's a tie between and mid-summer sunset.
Very good, Michael.
God, I missed this.
Oh, hey.
Have you guys seen Steven?
I hear a weird, piercing noise, but I don't know where it's coming from.
- Do you hear anything, Michael?
- Yeah, it's justJackie.
Uh,Jackie, I'm sorry you have to see me in this T-shirt.
I know how it emphasizes my hunkalicious bod.
Shut up, Michael.
I made a stupid slip.
It meant nothing.
Right, because Michael is my boyfriend.
I know he is, skank wad.
- Oh, I'm a skank wad?
- Girl fight!
Let's get it on!
We are not gonna fight.
Well, maybe you should kiss and make up.
Let's get it on!
What?
What?
Wait.
Ah, I'll go with the blonde.
Kitty, I'm just going to the corner to get you some soup.
I'm not leaving you for somebody younger and less dramatic.
This is your fault.
If I wanna get my wife out of bed I gotta tie a rope around her and attach it to my bumper and pull her out like a stump.
So what were you saying, dear?
Um, well, I was saying that I'm getting married.
Oh, honey, how wonderful!
So, who's the lucky girl?
- Well, um, Donna.
- Oh.
Well, I guess this is a small town.
Okay, what the hell did that mean?
That, my friend, is the seldom heard but much feared Grandma burn.
Your only warning is the jingle of costume jewelry and the overpowering scent of BenGay.
Well, you and Jackie are certainly a mess.
I remember before Nina when my love life was a mess.
It's perfect now though.
Not like yours, which is a mess.
Steven, I've called three times in the last half hour.
Figured it was you.
All the calls came during commercials in the Newlywed Game.
So, what?
Now you're not taking my calls?
Why are you making such a big deal about this?
Because it is a big deal when you yell, ''Get off my boyfriend'' - to a girl who's on someone who's not me.
-  Steven, I cannot be held responsible for the things that come out of my mouth.
It didn't mean anything.
So that's your story?
''It didn't mean anything''?
Right.
Right.
So, you just need to get over it.
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry.
I'm over it.
In fact, I'm over you.
Steven, what are you saying?
He's saying he's breaking up with you.
Are you not paying attention?
Because I'm on the edge of my freakin' seat here.
Steven.
So, I have a girlfriend and you don't.
So, my grandma doesn't think Donna's good enough for me.
How great is that?
Finally, someone thinks Donna's the lucky one.
No more, ''Hey, how'd he get her?
'' Or, ''Oh, that skinny guy must really be rich.
'' Yeah, that's right.
I heard the whispers.
I just pretended not to.
Who was whispering?
We said it right to you.
Well, I'm done with Jackie, and I feel like a guy who had a 95-pound mole removed- a 95-pound, Donny Osmond loving shoe-shopping, Ice Capade attending mole.
Hyde, I know that's just coming from a place of deep, deep pain.
And I really do feel bad that my ''foxitude'' broke you and Jackie up.
And I'd tone it down, but I just don't know how!
Guys, I'm worried there's some unfinished business between Michael and Jackie.
When they were together, did she make him happy?
Well, she totally dominated him and made him feel bad about himself.
I guess what I'm asking is, was she ever fat or anything?
Eric, how can your grandmother not like me?
Ooh!
Maybe I should wear my Catholic school uniform around her more.
People like me in that.
Well, guys mostly.
But, hey, give it a shot.
Grandmas have secrets too.
Donna, Steven broke up with me.
Oh.
Jackie, I'm sorry.
Hey, maybe he just wanted you to be able to spend more time with your other boyfriend.
Shut up, Eric!
Oh.
It's you.
Didn't know they let slutballs in here.
Well, I've seen you in here, so I figured it was okay.
Oh, you don't know it, but you just burnt yourself.
Oh, I know it.
The question is, do you?
I just said I do.
So do I, so you are too.
Donna, you following this?
Um, I think one of'em's a slutball and one of'em knows it.
I think what we need to do is go talk about Michael.
Fine.
I'll try to use small words so you can understand me.
That's not gonna be good enough.
- Hey, Grandma.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Sigurdson.
Nice day, huh?
No.
It's raining, and my arthritis is kicking up.
What a coincidence.
Mine too.
Boy, am I getting old.
Not too old, you know.
Whatever you are.
Wow.
Hey, Grandma, Donna brought you some salsa.
Yep, Donna makes the best darn salsa outside of your beloved Arizona.
It's a reflection of her long-time love affair with the Southwest.
Much like your own.
Go, Grand Canyon!
So, Eric, who are you seeing these days?
Okay.
Okay, Grandma, you have got to give Donna a chance.
And I know you two will get along famously.
You have so much in common.
Right.
Like I love eating dinner at 4:30 too.
Look, Miss Sigurdson, I love Eric with all my heart.
And I know that when you give me a chance, you'll see that we're great together.
Well, that's very sweet.
And you're right.
I'm sure you're the nicest girl Eric's met so far.
She is just so good at that.
See?
Isn't it better to be up and about than stuck in your bed for a week?
Well, this is better.
Why did I let that woman get to me?
I'm gonna get out of this robe.
And take a shower.
I mean, that's the spirit!
Your mother is a nutbag!
What did she do?
That thing where she pretends to be nice, but she's really insulting you.
- Yes!
- Frigid witch!
I'll get the bed ready.
How could she not like me?
How can she not like me?
You know what?
Maybe she just can't handle strong, healthy women.
And I am strong and healthy.
-  - Yeah.
- Well, I am not giving up on her.
- Oh, why are you worried?
I'm the one who has to live the rest of my life in the same family with this woman.
Yeah, but so do I. In the sense that, um we're all part of the human family.
Steven, I have to tell you something.
Well, if it's ''get off my boyfriend,'' don't worry.
I already heard it.
No.
I have to tell you, you were right.
When I said that, it did mean something.
And I thought it didn't, because sometimes I just want things because other people have them.
Like once, I made my dad buy me a pet rat because my cousin had one.
But then the rat got so disgusting, I made my kitty cat hunt it.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
- Who's the rat?
Am I the rat?
- No.
No.
Steven- Look.
Okay, I spoke to Annette.
And she made me realize that, okay maybe I do have some leftover feelings for Michael.
And then she said that if I wanted him, I'd have to fight for him.
But, Steven, I know in my heart the only person I wanna fight for is you.
Really?
Oh, boy!
You like Kelso, but you like me a little bit more?
What a bunch of crap!
You know what I think,Jackie?
I think the only reason you're with me in the first place was to get back at Kelso.
Steven, how can you say that?
Okay, fine.
Maybe I do have feelings for Michael.
But what am I supposed to do?
He was my first boyfriend.
And you know what?
You're gonna have to learn to deal with it.
And if you can't and you're gonna have to break up with me because of that then I can't stop you, but I think it's a real waste, because I love you.
I'm not saying it back!
I don't care.
Damn it!
So, are we gonna go to the dance or what?
Oh, Steven.
Well, it looks like I'm just in time for makeup sex.
Don't mind me.
You'll barely hear me.
If you prefer, I can hide in the shower.
- Fez, get out of here.
- Okay, here I go.
Earlier today I mentioned that I would like your balloons to be my walkway of love.
And you said, ''Okay.
'' Do you know what I meant?
Because I don't want to surprise you with this one.
Well, I think you meant- That's it!
- Hey, look who's back together.
- What the hell!
Come on,Jackie.
Let's dance.
How can she be with him when she's so clearly not over me?
I think the question is, how can you be with me when you're so clearly not over her?
What, is this a riddle?
Start over.
You're obviously still in love with Jackie.
I'm goin' back to California.
Baby, no!
I'll prove that I'm over her.
I'll bet you 50 bucks that if we do it, I'll be into it.
Good-bye, Michael.
But you win either way!
Oh, I feel so much better.
I am a strong, healthy woman who doesn't need to go to bed every time some mean, old lady gives her a cross look.
- That's right.
- Good evening, Mother.
- Going out to dinner.
- Oh.
Is that what you're wearing?
I'll be in bed.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
And then I realized, that's why they call it a clock radio.
'Cause it's got both.
Hey, Donna.
Feast your eyes.
All new stuff for me and Joanne's weekend away at tennis camp.
BillieJean King's sister is leading the campfire songs.
We're gonna make quite the racket.
Good one, Bob.
Bob's goin' out of town for the weekend?
All right!
Party at Donna's!
Okay.
We're gonna need beer, balloons and girls with low self-esteem.
Guys, hang on.
Donna and I already made plans this weekend.
Well, then just leave us a key, man.
And don't worry.
If anything bad happens I know how to make it look like a robbery-homicide.
Look, Eric and I want one weekend alone where we don't have to be so secret about being engaged.
I could even wear my ring if it weren't being resized for me.
Can they make a ring big enough to fit your Paul Bunyan hands?
- Jackie?
- Well, I'm sorry, Donna but if you're not gonna have a party, you're gonna get insulted.
It's just the way it is.
The way I see it, unless Donna's blockin' the door with her giant hands - we're comin' over for a party.
- Oh-Oh!
We should get one of those girls that jump out of cakes.
Yeah.
They're great.
You know, you two could do a little less standin' around and a little more jumpin' out of cakes.
Morning.
Hey, Dad, I was thinking of spending tonight and tomorrow over at Fez's.
At whose's?
The foreign boy with the tight pants wears a little too much cologne.
I don't like him.
I caught him stealin' bacon out of our fridge.
Why are you doing your homework in the morning?
Uh, I was out last night with Donna.
Well, of course you were.
That's why you came in a half hour past the curfew.
Oh, well, Donna had a flat.
Ohh!
That's awful bad luck.
Seein' how Donna doesn't have a car.
I see you getting bigger but you still act like a 12-year-old.
Now, when are you gonna grow up and start thinkin' about your future?
Red, don't get upset so early.
You won't enjoy your sausage and Tang.
Sausage and Tang?
Is- Is that a little racy for breakfast?
I don't get it.
Well, I'm gonna leave before someone explains it.
Good morning.
Steven.
You got a big tear in that jacket.
Yeah.
It's hard hoppin' over a fence carrying two 12 packs.
I mean, library books.
Well, I'm gonna ignore that, 'cause you don't even have parents to buy you a new coat.
He doesn't have parents, Eric.
He told me that sometimes when he's all alone, he cries.
Oh, that settles it.
I'm taking you shopping for a new coat.
Here, here.
Take some Tang and go.
Man, if I had a dollar for every time I heard a chick say that.
What?
What?
Never turn down Tang.
Growing boys need Tang.
What is funny here?
##  ##   Oh, the plumber took apart the toilet upstairs, so you'll have to use this one.
- I know it's scary down here at night, but- - She'll be fine.
Let's go.
Just when you come around that corner in the dark, that coat rack can look like a bear.
Finally - we're alone.
- For the whole weekend.
All right!
Party time!
I brought the Slip 'n Slide.
Let's move the couch.
Okay.
I'll get the hose.
No, we don't need the hose, man.
We'll just use beer.
- Kelso, are you nuts?
- You're right.
We don't wanna waste the beer.
Go get the hose, man.
No!
Guys, we said, no party.
Oh, come on, Forman.
Look, man, you gotta help me out here.
Jackie and I are going through a really rough time and maybe, just maybe, we can start to heal if you can find it in your heart to let me trash your girlfriend's house!
Don't care.
But it's party time, man.
I invited a girl in a halter top who was on her fifth beer.
- Fifth beer!
Halter top!
- Forget it, Kelso.
But do you know what a Slip 'n Slide can do to a halter top?
It turns it into a belt.
- Hello?
- Hello, is, uh, Mr. Forman there?
No, I'm sorry.
You just missed him.
Can I take a message?
Yes.
This is, uh, Fenton from All That Glitters.
Um, Mr. Forman bought a ring here, and I'm calling to tell him it's ready.
And, ah, oh, it looks fabulous.
He bought me a ring?
Oh, uh-  I, uh- I hope it wasn't a surprise.
Perhaps you shouldn't know that I called.
Um- Uh, could you let Mr. Forman know that I called.
I mean, um- You shouldn't know that he bought you- Oh!
Now I've made a messy.
Okay.
Okay, dinner is all ready.
I just had to add the secret ingredient- love.
- By the way, "love" is salt.
-  All right.
Chicken Pinciotti for two.
Um, is this red stuff gravy or blood?
There's no gravy.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's just kinda moist then.
Actually, it's kinda pink.
Is this ham?
No, it's Chicken Pinciotti.
Mine looks fine.
Well, if you don't wanna eat yours we have some Fruity Pebbles.
No- No.
Grown-ups don't eat Fruity Pebbles.
They eat chicken.
What grown-ups?
Where are these grown-ups?
Donna, us.
The whole point of this weekend is to prove that we're grown up and that Red doesn't know what he's talking about when he says I'm immature.
It is?
I don't know.
I thought the point of this weekend was to have, you know, a fun, light weekend.
Yeah.
No, it will be fun and light.
It's just that in the next 36 hours I would like to prove to myself that my father's been wrong about me my entire life.
But in a fun, light way.
- Well, whatever.
You don't have to eat the chicken.
- No!
What?
No.
Are you kidding?
I was kidding.
I'm doing our grown up, domestic squabbling thing, you know?
It's like, I make fun of your cooking, you tell me to put on pants when we have company.
Are you gonna stop wearing your pants?
'Cause I might have a problem with that.
See?
Good, we're bickering like husband and wife.
What, you call this dinner?
Hey, take my wife, please.
That's delicious.
Steven, just come in.
Your jacket looks fine.
Mrs. Forman, I don't think this jacket's really my style.
Oh, nonsense.
Ever since I've know you, you've been nothing but flash and pizzazz.
Oh, and look, it says "stuntman" on the arm.
People are gonna think you're from Hollywood.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
I was wondering if I might look at that ring you called Mr. Forman about that he doesn't know I know about yet.
Oh.
I don't think I'm supposed to show you, but- but I do a lot of things behind this counter I'm not supposed to do.
So, hmm.
This is an engagement ring.
An engagement ring?
Uh-oh.
Why would Red give me a diamond ring?
Maybe it's a menopause diamond.
You know, for a happy menopause.
Oh, oh, it's engraved.
"To Donna".
You're a lucky woman, Donna.
I mean, Mr. Forman seems a tad young for you but, uh, men and women are doing all sorts of things we never used to do, hmm?
Oh, my goodness!
This is from Eric to- Eric and Donna are engaged?
Well, if they are, I'm learning it here for the first time.
So, Mr. Stuntman.
Mm-hmm.
Are you from Hollywood?
I gotta tell ya, this "being grown up" thing really seems to work for us.
It's like we're already good at being married.
All we did was eat.
Hey, a little secret they don't tell ya?
That's all marriage is.
Forman, listen.
I just got back from the mall with your mom.
Nice coat, Hyde.
Burt Reynolds have a garage sale?
Yeah, Hyde, Donna and I are trying to be alone.
We got no use for a shiny, red stuntman.
- Look, would you shut up and listen to me- - No!
Okay?
This house is closed to parties, okay?
So just go away.
Oh, and tell the cast of Smokey and the Band/t that I said, "10-4".
Fine.
I'm gone, man.
Don't you mean, "I'm eastbound and down, good buddy"?
What does a married couple do after a delicious dinner of Chicken Pinciotti?
Well, we could make out on the couch but we're married, so maybe we should just fight and go to bed.
- Whoa.
- What's wrong?
Whoa!
Okay, I think the Chicken Pinciotti wants to - fly the coop.
- Oh.
I'm gonna be upstairs for a little bit.
Uh, do you have any magazines that I could-Whoa!
Okay.
I'm- l-l-I'll just read the shampoo.
Well, wait.
You can't- You can't use the bathroom upstairs.
You have to use the one off the den.
Th- Right in there?
Wh-While-While you're right in here?
L-l-I can't do that.
You might sense something.
I "might sense something"?
How much of a ruckus are you gonna make?
Wh- I just- I can't go here, okay?
And I can't go home because Red thinks I'm over at Fez's.
What- I'm a man without a country.
Eric, you wanted to be grown up.
And- Well, this is something that grown-ups do in the same house.
No, I ju-You know what I was thinking?
I could build us another house, a separate house.
Eric, you're talking about an outhouse.
Well, it's about time those made a comeback!
Eric and Donna can't be engaged.
They're too young.
How does something like this happen?
Well, Eric asked her to marry him and instead of saying "ew," like a normal person Donna said "yes".
Well, I don't like secret-keeping in my house.
What else is going on that I don't know about?
Ooh.
There is something else.
In the back left corner of Forman's closet he has stashed some highly offensive photographic material.
Well, this has gotta stop.
Eric should have told me about his engagement, because in this house we do not keep secrets.
What are you talkin' about?
Cheesecake.
Different types of cheesecake.
Oh.
Sorry I missed it.
Don't judge me.
Kelso, I need to use your bathroom.
Nope.
There's nobody here.
Of course, I can't see people who don't have parties for their friends.
So maybe there is somebody here, and I just can't see 'em.
I can't see you, Eric!
Kelso, I really need to use the bathroom.
Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you kicked us out of Donna's house, you party pooper.
- Yeah.
- No party, no pooper!
- Nice.
- Yeah, it really was.
No party, no pooper!
So then I said, "No party, no pooper"!
Because he wouldn't have a party.
See, I think it's stupid that Eric and Donna need to practice being married.
I mean, it's simple.
The woman just needs to be a cook in the kitchen a maid in the living room, and an acrobat in the bedroom.
And I can hire a cook and a maid.
I am liking you more and more.
You know, I was thinkin' about The Incred/ble Hulk.
I like that show.
Especially the part where he gets all, like, mad and turns green and then his shirt rips off.
But then I was thinkin', like what if he was purple?
And a lady?
Come on.
Like an angry, naked purple chick.
That's better, right?
What's go/n'on down here?
Why doesn't anybody ever go home?
And then I realized, that's why they call it a clock radio.
Cause it's got both!
What are you doin' here?
I thought Eric was with you.
Eric is always with me in spirit.
Don't pussyfoot around.
I make three phone calls, you're back on that raft you floated in on.
- Eric is at Donna's.
- Fez!
I fear the open sea.
Kitty.
You know what I just found out about Eric?
You found out?
He lied to us.
He's spending the night at Donna's.
Oh!
What did you think it was?
He has dirty magazines in his closet.
Our son is a pervert.
I'm just gonna go pray for him.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Well, speak of the idiot.
- I gotta use the bathroom.
- What's a matter with the foreign kid's bathroom?
That is where you were, isn't it?
Yeah, of course.
Wh-Why would I lie to you about something like that?
I need bacon.
Okay, uh, the reason I'd lie about something like that is- What happened?
You piss Donna off, and she locked you out?
- Donna?
No.
- Oh.
Well, you pissed me off, so I'm lockin' you out.
- Did you find- - Don't stop loving me!
Well, look who's here.
Oh, say, Eric.
The morning paper didn't come.
So I thought that you could tell me a story while I eat.
I know how good you are at making up stories.
Why don't you tell me things?
You can tell me things, even bad things.
A mother's love is like a flower that never wilts.
Unless it's lied to.
If you're done reciting poetry, I'd like to yell at the kid.
Hey, Forman, this is about to get ugly.
So if you have to go potty, now's a good time.
I'm sorry.
Okay, I shouldn't have told you I was at Fez's.
Do you ever think about what you're doing with your life?
Hey, Dad.
It's my life, okay?
I'm grown up now.
Grown up?
Well, you sure say that a lot, so it must be true.
Let me try it.
Hey, everybody.
I'm Mr. Rogers.
But wait, I'm not wearing a sweater.
And I'm about to kick your ass.
Maybe it doesn't work.
Maybe you're just an immature pissant who still lies to his parents.
You know what, Dad?
Oh, my God.
You're right.
Y- I have been lying and acting immature, and keeping secrets.
And I swear to God, I'm just as sick of it as you are.
So, here's the truth.
Donna and I are engaged.
I get his room.
- You're engaged?
- Yeah.
- I already gave her the ring.
- Kitty, are you hearing this?
Yes, I am.
And for the first time too.
Well, it's true.
So, if I'm gonna be ready to be married, which I am then I guess I should be ready to tell you the truth.
So, there it is.
Wow.
That felt great.
I'm gonna go see my fiancÃ©.
Wow, that felt great too.
What a great day!
Okay.
Okay, this is good.
We're all being open here.
Does anybody have anything else they wanna get off their chest?
Mrs. Forman, I hate my jacket.
Oh, well, now we're just trying to hurt each other.
Okay, now.
Come on, Steven.
Give it another chance.
Oh, it's snazzy!
Hey, there.
Hi, there.
Check out my outerwear.
I'll just give this to Goodwill.
And read the arm- "stuntman".
People are gonna think I'm from Hollywood.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Forman, why'd you have to tell Red you got engaged?
Look at him- yelling and waving.
Oh!
A little spit just landed on Bob.
Bob's so scared, he's not even wiping it off.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This time Red is really gonna kill me.
My only hope is that he actually sticks his foot so far up my ass he can't pull it out, and I get to take him straight to hell with me.
Why did you tell him?
We had it all planned.
We were gonna give them wine, get 'em all loose and juiced.
But you spilled the beans.
Good, because wine and beans is not a good combo.
Hey.
Toot-toot, if you know what I mean.
Sorry I'm late!
I was cutting through backyards on the way over here and the Hendersons got a new jungle gym!
Whoa.
They're still yelling?
Yeah.
I'm trying to read Red's lips, but I can't make it out.
He keeps calling me a "stupid duck".
-  - Ah!
Hey, I'll go spy on them.
I just gotta run home real quick and change into my ninja outfit.
I don't think this situation calls for camouflage, Kelso.
Well, that doesn't mean it's not fun to wear, Eric!
But they're just too young to get married.
How are they gonna live on their own?
Eric jumps a foot every time the furnace kicks on.
Exactly.
He's not mature enough to get married.
I'm still cutting the crusts off his sandwiches.
Well, it's really more for me.
He's my baby.
Don't mind me.
Feel free to keep talking.
I'm just getting a soda.
I'm not spying.
Hey, l-I don't like this engagement either but it's not like they can break it off.
Why the hell not?
Well, it wouldn't be very romantic, for one.
Oh, forget about it.
I'll take care of this myself!
No, no.
Red, if you go out there and yell, you're just gonna drive him away.
I'm sorry, Kitty, but yelling is the only part of being a father that I enjoy.
Red- Red, I am putting my foot down.
I forbid it.
All right.
Fine.
Wow!
Red, I forbid you to- Shut up, Bob.
Burn!
- Get out!
- Yeah.
Well?
What were they saying?
I don't know.
Well, I was so busy acting like I wasn't listening, I forgot to listen.
-  - Man!
I betcha he's trying to think of a punishment.
He already took away the Vista Cruiser and- and fined me.
What's next?
Is he gonna cut off my pinkie?
Ay!
What's the point of getting married, Red's gonna cut that off?
##  ##   Nina, you have such beautiful fingers.
So long and elegant- like spider legs.
- We can't do this here.
-  We can go to the backseat of the student-driver car.
But I have to warn you- I have a hard time keeping my hands at 10:00 and 2:00.
Fez, this tension between us is causing problems.
And here at the D.M.V., I've learned it's easier to solve problems when they're posed in a multiple-choice format.
So, "A," we can further explore our relationship and hope that relieves the tension or, "B," I can fire you.
Is this some kind of trick?
It's not a trick.
Hmm, so it is a trick.
I choose "B".
No, you choose "A"!
Okay, I'll take "A".
But I think you should throw a little "T" in there too.
- Dinner's ready, Eric.
- You know what?
Um, Dad's in there, so I'll just, you know, forage for berries.
Look, I am not happy about this situation either but I am in there making the best of it not out here diddling a basketball.
Mom, if I was out here diddling a basketball this would be a very different conversation.
Get in there.
Well, look who I found.
Our son- who we love very much.
- Hey, Dad.
- Pass the peas, Steven.
Red, your son spoke to you.
I heard him.
But you asked me not to yell at him, and I agreed.
So I'm just taking your idea and refining it.
Oh, so you're giving me the silent treatment?
So, Steven, how was school today?
Um, well, in health class today, we learned that an early engagement's often a sign of heavy drug use.
Hyde!
Red, you're being a big baby.
No, Mom, it's okay.
Actually, it's a pleasant surprise but let's see how serious he is about it.
Hey, Dad, you know who's got the right idea?
- Russia.
-  I haven't felt this kind of tension in years.
Reminds me of home.
Except everyone's wearing a shirt.
Oh!
Is this for me?
-  Yeah.
- Jackie, it's your birthday?
Ah, I figured you knew.
A good boyfriend would have, but whatever.
Hey, why didn't you tell me, man?
I would have gotten you something.
Well, I didn't want to make a big deal about it.
'Cause I'm trying not to care so much about gifts and material things, and-  Oh, it's not working, because this is beautiful!
Oh!
I'm gonna go try it on!
Thank you!
Mmm.
-  -  Kelso, what are you doing, man?
You trying to make me look bad?
No, I'm not doing anything.
Well, whatever you are doing you shouldn't go up against me, 'cause you're not gonna win.
Well, I'm not doing anything, and I am going to win.
No.
You're gonna lose.
How can I lose if I'm not doing anything?
How can you win if you're not doing anything?
Well, if I win, I'll admit that I'm doing something.
Nina, I think people at work are starting to notice there's something between us.
Well, it didn't help when you stood up at the staff meeting and said, "I want to do it with Nina".
Well, they asked if there was any unfinished business.
I think I've figured out a way to get rid of all this tension.
You need to spend the night with me.
I'm all yours, boss lady.
But you have to tell me where to stop now because I have been burned in the past.
I don't want you to stop anywhere.
Oh.
Oh!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
Fez!
Sorry.
I wrote this song about three years ago, and I finally get to use it.
That sweater wasn't on sale or anything.
Paid full price.
Pretty sweet, huh?
Yes.
But it gets less sweet the more you talk about it.
Sorry.
I'm done.
Twenty-seven dollars!
Hey.
How was work with Red?
It was terrible.
I thought Red not talking to me would be cool.
But today, instead of telling me to sweep the back room he just threw a broom at me.
Well, what about if I talked to him?
We've always gotten along.
Maybe I can get through to him.
Donna, I'm not gonna make you fight my battles for me.
I'm not gonna ask the woman that I love to do what I should do.
But Red'll be home at about 5:30, so try to catch him before dinner, okay?
Attention, everyone.
My friend Fez has some wonderful news.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
I did it!
All right, Fez!
Nah!
Wait!
Wait.
I want to hear this.
"I did it" who?
Wait.
Fez, I can't believe you finally lost your virginity!
Wait, wait.
This isn't like the time you bought a hamster named it "Virginity," and then lost it, is it?
No.
This is the real thing.
You know, I had a hamster once.
I tied him up to a helium balloon with a note.
Made it all the way to Minnesota.
- Alive?
- No, I'm gonna send a dead hamster up in a balloon.
- So?
Come on.
Tell us all about it.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, It was incredible.
Nina and I started out kissing in the living room.
Then we moved into the bedroom, where we undressed.
And, uh, well, then- then we did it.
What- Details, Fez.
We need details!
Well, our faces didn't line up right so I kept bumping my chin on her nose.
And then there were some sounds.
What kind of sounds?
I will say this.
It was not applause.
There was no romantic music like in the movies, so I had to hum.
And then Nina told me to stop humming.
And, uh, then I started again without realizing it.
And then she got mad.
And then I think she got sad.
Oh, well, don't worry, Fez.
She probably just felt bad she was doing it with a foreigner.
And then afterwards, I went into the bathroom, and, uh- and cried a little.
And then I snuck out the back door.
Poor Fez.
Well, you know, at least it couldn't have been any worse.
I left my underwear in her bathroom.
Mr. Forman, you remember what it felt like when you fell in love with Mrs. Forman, don't you?
Nope.
One day I just woke up, and my life was over.
Next question.
Well, I think, um- I think what Mr. Forman is trying to say is that we worry you're too young to get married.
Do you even know how to bake a casserole?
I don't think you do.
Look, I believe there's one person out there for everyone.
And you guys are that person for each other, and Eric is that person for me.
And if you could just open your hearts you'd see that we should be together forever.
Because we're in love, and we make each other really happy.
Donna, that is so romantic.
I still think you're too young.
But if it has to be someone, I'm glad it's you.
I always wanted a daughter.
You already have a daughter.
A better daughter.
You know what, Donna?
You're right.
You are Eric are perfect for each other.
- Really?
- Yes!
You're as big a dumb-ass as he is!
Welcome to the family.
I'm so nervous about working with Nina today.
It's like, now that we did it, I never want to see her face again.
Yeah, you did it, all right.
Hey, hey!
Look who's wearing a $27 sweater!
Jackie, you can't keep that sweater.
- Why not?
- Because it's from Kelso.
Yeah, but it's so pink and fuzzy that it just makes up for it.
Kelso, she's someone else's girlfriend.
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
And it's working.
Just take it off.
Leave it on.
Take it off.
Let's see some skin.
Yeah.
Take it off.
- Why is everyone against me?
- Because you're telling a girl to keep her top on.
That's true.
Take it off.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
- After you.
- Here.
Let me, um- - I know how it goes.
Okay.
Just- I'm just trying to help.
Now it's stuck!
You just have to give it a yank.
This is just like last night!
Okay.
Where's Red?
I just found out he called my daughter a dumb-ass.
- What?
- Well, I really thought I was getting through to him.
But then he snuck a "dumb-ass" in.
That is a hurtful word.
You got to do something about your husband, Kitty.
You guys'd be lucky to get Donna.
If anything, she's gonna pretty your family up.
Excuse me?
I'm just sayin', we're a voluptuous bunch.
Mom, you need to talk to Dad.
I don't know why you're surprised he's upset.
Why did you have to get engaged?
And why did you have to tell your father?
He's not stable, Eric.
Okay, fine.
I'll talk to him myself.
Eric, be careful.
I looked deep into Red's eyes, and I saw- Well, I just saw me upside down and tiny, but he looked mad.
You know what?
I don't care.
I'm going down to Price Mart.
And if I don't come back, then, Donna, please move on with your life.
Wedding or no wedding, we're still getting one of those triple-decker cakes.
Oh, working with someone you have had sex with is the worst thing ever.
I don't know how Donny and Marie do it.
You know, sex ruins everything.
No, I disagree, Fez.
I mean, sure, the first time can be awkward.
Well, it wasn't for me and Jackie.
You know, maybe I should tell the story.
Yeah.
It's a great story, Hyde.
You know what, Kelso?
It's gettin' real old.
And the story I remember after your first time was you didn't call her for a week.
I was gonna skip that part.
Wait.
That's right.
You didn't call me.
Oh.
That's because he was thinking about breaking up with you.
What?
No, I told you.
I didn't call you 'cause we were having our phones cleaned!
And then to get back on your good side he bought you a stupid stuffed unicorn.
Fluffycakes?
Fluffycakes is tainted?
See, he wanted something from you.
So he bought you a present.
Sound familiar?
Michael, why did you buy me this sweater?
All right.
It's time to come clean.
I stole the sweater!
Fine.
You know what?
Forget it.
I don't want it, so just take it.
Now we're talking.
Give us a little dance.
Told you it wouldn't work.
I wasn't doing anything!
Hey, let's not fight.
We all saw a littleJackie side-boob.
I think we all won.
- Hi, Fez.
Okay, look- - Nina I know what you're going to say.
The other night was awful, and you just want to be friends.
No.
I was going to say, the other night was awful and we should practice and get better at it.
Oh.
Well, I have to say, I don't hate the sound of that.
So, um, uh, should I make an appointment, or- - Just get in the house.
- Okay.
One second.
I'm going to do it again!
I'm going to do it again!
Okay, Dad.
You can ignore me and you can call my girlfriend names, but here's the thing.
Donna and I are getting married.
Okay?
Whether you like it or not.
But you're too young.
And you're throwing your life away.
Wha-You said I was throwing my life away when I quit T-ball.
And I was right about that too.
You're not marrying her, and that's final.
Well, Dad, you can't stop me.
Okay?
I'm gonna be graduating soon.
I'll be on my own.
I have a job.
I mean, I make enough money to pay for the wedding myself.
Well, that's great.
But you don't have a job.
You're fired.
- What?
- You're fired.
Let's see you pay for a wedding now.
Punch out and empty your locker.
Fine!
- But I'm keeping the smock!
- Give me the smock!
- Jackie.
- Hmm?
Happy birthday.
Steven, you shouldn't have!
Oh!
It's a Led Zeppelin T-shirt.
And it's used!
Yeah, that's my favorite one.
You're with me now, so I wanted you to have it.
Oh!
Steven, I love it!
- Do I have to wear it?
- No.
Steven, I love it!
Oh!
Well, that was a nice Who wants a little kick in their coffee?
I know I do.
You're the dumb-ass!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Eric, what are you doing eating?
Well, it's mainly for survival.
But I also enjoy the fruity taste.
I told you to replace the hubcap on the Vista Cruiser.
So, what is it?
You're mature enough to get married but not mature enough to replace a hubcap?
Well, let's see.
You took away my keys, so I can't drive.
And you took away my job, so I can't afford a new hubcap.
You also took away my self-esteem, so I have no pride in my job or my possessions.
For gosh sake, you've been arguing for two weeks.
Now stop it.
Help me with this crossword puzzle.
I need a four-letter word for disappointment.
Eric.
It fits.
Well, now, that can't be right.
So, he's like, "Replace the hubcap".
And I'm like, "Hey, why don't you replace the hubcap".
And that is why I'm trimming the hedges.
Yeah.
I only mess with Red when I really need the discipline.
He's a total hard-ass.
Hard-ass?
Take another look, my friend.
It jiggles when he wiggles.
Man, I don't know what the hell the deal is with Leo.
He told me to take a week off two weeks ago - and I haven't heard from him since.
- We need to find him 'cause we're all out of film, if you know what I mean.
I need film.
Then I could take pictures of Nina and me doing it.
Fez, film doesn't really mean "film".
Who cares?
Because for the first time in my life doin' it really means "doin' it".
So, I guess this is the way an immature, engaged, high school dumb-ass with no car, no job and no money trims the hedges.
That was like eight burns in one sentence.
An octo-burn.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Okay, you two, since you won't bond on your own I have signed you up for the father/son competition at this year's Point Place Paul Bunyan Pioneer DayJamboree.
- Kitty, that sounds horrible.
- Yeah, I agree.
You hear that?
We've already bonded.
No, it's too late.
It's for charity.
Now, don't forget your commemorative coonskin caps.
Huh.
So that's what you'd look like with hair.
##  ##   - Hey.
- I'd kiss you but I'm afraid your hat will wake up and scratch my eyes out.
So, you guys, Joanne has been chosen to emcee Pioneer Days.
Tell 'em why, baby.
I won the tobacco-spitting contest last year.
What a lady.
I'll be mannin' the hard-cider booth.
It's a good way to raise money 'cause of all the drunks.
Oh!
Ooh, people are signing in.
Come on.
Get excited, you two!
Well, howdy, newcomers!
I'm Charlie Miller.
You can call me Charlie.
This is my son, Mitch.
You can call me "ladies man".
- "Ladies man".
- Did somebody call me?
I'm Red Forman.
This is my son, Eric.
You can call him dumb-ass.
Well, we don't use the A-S-S word.
We have a reputation to uphold.
We're the two-time champs.
Little secret, Red.
I tell Mitch it doesn't matter how we do as long as we're together.
- And why is that, Dad?
- 'Cause we bad!
- Oh, yeah, that's right!
We bad!
- We bad!
All right.
Dad, they have a catch phrase.
Hey, what's ours?
Shut up, dumb-ass.
Yeah.
Shut up, dumb-ass.
Okay.
Yeah.
No wonder Leo hasn't told me to come to work.
There's no work to come to.
- Mmm, did he leave a note?
-  Nope.
Just this.
You know, he looked dirty but he always smelled like clean sheets.
You're talking about him like he's gone, man.
He would have told me if he was leaving town.
Maybe a U.F.O. Appeared.
And it shot down a beam and made everyone and everything inside the Fotohut vanish.
Yeah, like an apparition.
Kelso, you don't even know what an apparition is.
Hey, if I can't use words I don't understand this is gonna be one quiet afternoon.
Let's get started.
"To make room for a new tradin' post "Paul Bunyan needs to clear-cut 200 acres of forest.
The first team to chop And chop!
Um, excuse me.
My ax is stuck.
Way to go, Mitch.
- That's right!
We bad!
- Oh, yeah, we bad!
Pull the ax out, Eric.
I can't.
It's really stuck in there.
And you think you're ready to be married.
You can't even chop wood.
What are you gonna do for heat in the winter, burn comic books?
Hmm, I don't know.
I guess I would probably just turn on the heater!
How can Eric and Red be fighting already?
Well, it's almost as if forcing them together against their will and giving them sharp objects wasn't really the best way to get them to make up.
Another hard cider, Bob.
Make it a double.
Well, we couldn't find Leo.
We just checked all his hangouts.
- The Hub.
- Alley behind The Hub.
- Fatso Burger.
- Alley behind the Fatso Burger.
Hyde, when are you gonna accept the fact that Leo just bailed?
Man, he would not leave without saying good-bye, okay?
I know him better than I know my own father.
I'd like to do it with Nina in an alley.
My bare ass pressed up against a cold Dumpster.
You know, we're getting killed here thanks to your screwing up that last event.
All you had to do was build a cabin out of Lincoln Logs.
Well, I thought I'd score some extra points by building the Millennium Falcon.
The Millennium what?
If that's a Star Wars thing, I'm gonna kick you in the ass.
It's not a Star Wars thing.
It's a very rare falcon that can do the Kessel Run in under six parsecs.
Hey, just remember, guys.
It's not whether you win or lose.
It's how you play the game.
Unfortunately, you guys don't know how to play the game.
Oh, hey.
We don't wanna rub it in their face they're big losers.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I don't know.
It just came out.
This is the worst Point Place Paul Bunyan Pioneer Days Jamboree ever.
And now, the cow-milking event.
Could you just award us our first-place points right now?
It'd save a lot of time and embarrassment for our friends over here.
You know, it kinda would.
"Babe the Blue Ox needs lots of calcium to carry Paul Bunyan's lumber "or his brittle bones will snap and he'll die.
"The first team to fill their barrel with milk and save Babe from osteoporosis wins".
And milk!
- Um, hey!
There's something wrong with our cow.
-  Her things aren't workin'!
You can't just yank on 'em.
Red never was much for foreplay.
- Keep it comin', Mitch.
- This is amazing.
It's like she was waiting for my magic fingers to coax that sweet liquid right out of her teats.
- Move over, Dad.
I'll show you how it's done.
- What makes you think- Go, Eric.
Go.
Well, honey, good for you.
Mitch, they're winning.
What happened to your magic fingers?
Get off my back, old man!
Dad, here.
Team Forman wins!
You let me down, son.
I thought you were better than that.
What are you gonna do?
Lock me in the closet again?
He locks me in the closet!
It's a walk-in!
It's a walk-in.
So, Dad, what do you say now?
Why are you so good at that?
How are we gonna break into Leo's apartment?
We need a credit card to slip in the door.
Ponch used one on CHiPs once and the lady he rescued was so grateful they did it.
Kelso, if we had a credit card, we could buy a sledgehammer and break down the door.
If we had a credit card, I'd be butt-deep in Jordache right now.
- Oh, Leo, man.
- I'm gonna kick him, see if he's okay.
- Kelso, no.
- Well, at least throw something at him.
If he's asleep, he'll wake up.
If he's dead, you can say you threw something at a dead guy.
Uuh!
Aah!
Officer, I have a prescription for that.
No, relax, bud.
We're just looking for Leo.
Oh, he left.
I'm his cousin, Eli.
Really, he just left?
He didn't call or anything?
Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.
Don't take it personal, Hyde.
You know Leo never liked phones.
He said he could hear voices in 'em.
By the way, he left a note.
Do any of you know a kid named Heidi?
He means Hyde.
That's me, man.
The note's for me!
I mean, the note's for me.
"Dear Hyde, man.
One day I stopped in Point Place for some gas.
"Before I knew it, eight years had passed.
"Whoa.
That rhymes.
"Anyway, I should get home to my wife.
"Take care.
You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid-man".
See, I told you he wouldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Oh, Steven, you really do love that old, dirty, little hippie.
And, uh, he left you something else.
He said that you liked "film," if you know what I mean.
All right.
I was hoping we could take something home.
Put it in the shirt pocket.
Holy hell!
You know, Donna, I've been drinking- I mean, thinking.
I want you and Eric to get married.
Okay, even though I know it's just the cider talking - yea!
-  "Pioneer Pete is lost in the woods.
"Assemble the map to find his bow and arrow.
"And shoot the bell with the arrow and Pioneer Pete will appear.
Do not shoot Pioneer Pete".
And go.
- Okay, this one goes here.
- And this piece goes here.
Come on, Mitch.
Don't give up.
Okay, Mr. "I Haven't Had AJob In Five Years".
- So the bow and arrow are behind the feeding trough!
- Go, go, go!
-  -  Howdy, y'all!
I'm Pioneer Pete!
Look, Donna.
It's me, your dad.
Well, Mitch, I hope you're happy.
How can I be happy?
Our whole life is a lie.
Am I really supposed to believe that Kathy is my little sister?
She doesn't look anything like me.
She is Cuban, for Pete's sake!
And what about your Friday bowling nights?
I looked in your bowling bag.
You know what I found?
Butt-less chaps!
What's with the butt-less chaps?
Your mother's inhibited.
Don't shake hands with that guy.
I can't close my mouth.
Can you close your mouth?
It's really starting to freak me out.
Leo's the best.
Leo made me a grilled cheese once.
He used butter and made the crust extra toasty.
He forgot cheese.
I'm gonna miss that grilled-cheese-makin' son of a bitch.
You know, one time, I heard Leo talking on the phone and he was speaking Chinese.
So I said, "Leo, stop speaking Chinese".
So he turned around, and it wasn't Leo.
It was a Chinese guy.
You know, I'll never forget that.
I'm just sad I'll never get to see his face when I tell him I did it with Nina.
Actually, I'd like to see my face when I do it with Nina.
I bet I look like a stallion.
So today we sit in this circle in honor of Leo.
He was my boss.
He was my friend.
He was my connection.
To Leo.
To Leo!
Well, I found out how much cider is too much cider.
A barrel?
Shut it!
Great news.
Little Timmy Stinson cut his finger off in a whittling event.
They're out.
We're in second place.
And if we win this next event, we'll be champions.
And maybe even friends.
Look, we've had a rough day and we've both said some things that we didn't mean.
But we've got to pull it together for this final event.
Just tell me where you go Friday nights.
I rent a motel room and I lock the door and I cry, okay?
I cry like a damn baby.
Why do you need butt-less chaps for that?
Okay, it's time for our final event.
"Transport your gold in a genuine covered wagon to Pioneer Pete's"- You know what?
I'm tired.
Pull the wagons.
Go.
##  ##  - Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
-  Ooh!
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's bad?
- We bad.
- That's right.
- We bad!
- We bad!
We bad!
Okay, it's time for Pioneer Pete to claim his gold!
I saw that, Donna.
Well, I'm sorry.
I know you think I'm a disappointment and stuff.
Hey.
I'm proud of how we did.
Look, I know what it's like to have your dad riding you all the time.
My old man was always on me to go to engineering school.
And when I didn't, he was so mad we didn't talk for a year.
So, you're the softy in your family?
See, my dad's vision for my life was wrong.
Only I knew what was best.
Not my dad.
You understand what I'm saying?
Wow.
Are-Are you admitting that you're wrong that it's okay for me and Donna to get married?
What?
No, no.
I'm saying that my dad was wrong and I was right.
Just like I'm right now.
The point is, I'm always right, so break it off!
Well, at least you're still happy for us.
Please, Donna, I'm standing right here.
There's no need to yell!
You know what?
I don't care what my dad says.
I am more committed to this marriage than ever.
Well, after seeing how you handled that cow, so am I. Okay.
So you raise the ax, and you bring it straight down.
- Okay?
Raise.
Bring down.
- That's easy.
Now, it's all about leverage.
You know, torque.
Okay.
I don't know what either of those is but I'll give it a shot.
- Let's get outta here.
- Right behind you.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
So, Hyde, big job fair tomorrow.
Oh, and you're in luck, 'cause I read that corporate America is experiencing a severe shortage of paranoid conspiracy nuts.
I'm not a conspiracy nut, okay?
My history, shop and gym teachers secretly started that rumor to discredit me.
I do need a job though since the Fotohut shut down.
And I'm never gonna get my pictures back, which is a real shame 'cause they'll never let me under the bleachers anymore.
You need a job too, Eric since you just got fired from your last job by your own daddy.
Well, at least my daddy's not in jail for bribery.
Okay.
So get this.
The radio station I work at wants me to work their job-fair booth as "Hot Donna".
All right?
As if I'm some object for guys to leer at.
God.
- Oh, my God!
Spank me!
- Oh, mama!
I guess being beautiful has its benefits.
Hey, shut up.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm talkin' about me, Donna.
And the best thing about being beautiful is I can get work as a model.
So I don't have to go to the job fair like the rest of you "uggos".
Well, I cannot wait.
Nina will be at the D.M.V. Booth, which means that Fez will be making out during a school day.
How many of you suckers have made out during a school day?
How many of you suckers have made out during a school day in the nude?
Then I will be nude.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
What?
I got startled, 'cause I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
I'm so handsome, I thought Shaun Cassidy was sitting in the backseat.
Yes.
You are a beautiful male specimen.
Except you have a gray hair.
What?
No, I don't- -  - Dude, I hit a cop car.
##  ##   All right, Eric.
Listen up.
You know how your mother and I feel about you and Donna getting engaged.
But since you won't listen to reason, I've come to a decision.
If you don't cancel this engagement I'm not paying for your college.
What?
Because he loves you.
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.
He's full of love.
But it's buried, just like treasure.
- Dad, how could you do this?
- Oh, it's easy.
Instead of giving $4,000 to a college I leave my checkbook in the drawer, count my money and laugh like a little girl.
Fine.
- He laughs because he loves you!
-  Where did you learn your parenting skills?
Korea.
Kitty, I am right about this.
Red, you can't just force people to do what you want.
Oh, see, that's one of those things that people say that's just not true.
Like, "There's no place like home".
Hell, I can think of a hundred places better than this.
- I cannot believe you hit a police car.
-  Now, don't worry.
It's a hot lady cop.
Just watch the master.
License and registration.
Yeah.
Just give me a sec here.
My wallet gets stuck, 'cause I've been working out.
My leg muscles are huge.
Oh, boy.
By the way, I can bench about 220 so that'd be about two of you, little lady.
What's your name?
Oh, my name is Fez, but I have a girlfriend so you need to cool it, little girl.
Yeah.
I'll try.
Okay, Mr. Kelso.
I'm gonna issue you a citation.
Oh, a citation for being too foxy in a school zone?
No.
A citation for $64.
Bench-press that.
So if we don't break off the engagement, Red's not gonna pay for my college.
You know, maybe this is it, Eric.
Maybe Red won.
No.
No, okay?
He's not gonna win.
You know what?
I'll just look for something full-time at the job fair.
- I'll pay for college myself.
People do that, right?
- Yeah, people with skills.
- But I mean, you're cute.
That's a skill.
- Stop.
How can Red do this to me?
I swear to God, that man is always mad.
I think the gene for joy might be stored in hair.
Well, there are a lot of angry bald men.
Yul Brynner in The K/ng and I. Yes.
Mr. Freeze from Batman.
- Remember that time Robin foiled his deep freeze- - Eric.
What did we talk about?
- Every time I reference Batman, I owe you a geek dollar.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Guys, something horrible happened.
Let me tell it.
Kelso tried to charm a lady cop, and it didn't work.
But she was all over me, boy.
I'm like freaking catnip.
Guys, today made me realize looks fade!
I'm not- I'm not gonna be able to be a model forever!
I'm gonna have to get a practical, realistic job like regular, ugly people.
Okay, so what sounds better- wide receiver or spy?
Well, Kelso, I don't see why you couldn't just do both.
You're right.
It's the perfect cover.
Okay.
Okay, everybody!
This is your last school field trip, so smile!
-  -  Okay, now wave hello to your futures.
Hello, futures!
Okay, now wave good-bye to your mothers who loved you and gave you the best years of their lives.
Now what are they gonna do?
What?
Tell me what I am supposed to do!
You're supposed to take your little, yellow pill.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Man, look at this place.
There's tons of butt-ugly people.
One day I'm gonna be one of'em.
Man, I can't do this.
Being around this many corporate stooges.
I can't breathe!
Steven, stop it!
This is serious.
If you keep pulling at cotton like that, it won't rebound.
Well, I'm off to find Nina for a little field-trip make out.
How many of you suckers have made out during a field trip?
What the hell?
Was I the only one watching sausage get made?
Well, lookee here.
You know, if America's employers are looking for a pretty-boy moron an engaged hophead and a mush-mouthed foreigner they're gonna be jumpin' for joy.
Wait a minute.
Am I the pretty-boy moron?
- Yes.
- Cool, 'cause that's the best one.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- So, you're ready for the big job search?
- Yup.
I got my rÃ©sumÃ©, my very best blazer and a really charming story about how my biggest fault is that I just work too darn hard, so- - How 'bout you?
- I don't know.
This is so humiliating.
I mean, I have a brain, you know.
by artist and genre.
I didn't do that with my boobs.
That'd be a neat trick though.
I've always been fascinated by the veterinary sciences.
Do you have any jobs available?
Yes.
We need someone to usher our four-legged friends into the next life.
All right.
That sounds fantastic.
And how do I do that?
You shovel the carcass into the furnace.
I've always been fascinated by transportation.
- Do you have any jobs available?
- Yes, roadkill remover.
Except sometimes the critter's not quite dead.
In that case, you gotta shoot it.
You're the "triggerman".
I've always been fascinated by meat.
- Do you have any jobs available?
- Yes.
Triggerman.
Please tell me you're kidding.
The cows don't kill themselves, son.
Although I did see one walk right off a cliff once.
Stock boy.
Need a stock boy.
Not you.
So, if I work here will I have to slaughter anything?
No, we're a bank.
We're looking for tellers.
Uh, just to be perfectly clear I won't have to murder any animals?
Whatever you do on your own time is fine with us.
Hello, First Midwestern!
Hi.
I'm Jackie, and this is Steven.
Steven is a no-nonsense Sagittarius who's not afraid of hard work or true love.
I'm Dave, a shy Pisces who's looking for love and a salesman to sell on commission.
- The more you sell, the more you can earn.
- That's perfect for him!
Steven, if you can get me to date you, you can sell anything.
Uh, thanks, but no, thanks.
Wait- Are you nuts?
That guy almost offered me a job!
- So, what's wrong?
- Did you hear him?
"The more you sell, the more you earn"?
The more you sleep, the more you earn.
That's my job.
Damn, woman!
So, Nina, after walking around the job fair and hearing the word "job" a lot it gave me needs.
No.
We're at a job fair.
Please don't say that word.
I can't go far from my booth.
It's my job.
Stop it.
Hi.
One of your officers recently issued me a ticket.
- My name is Michael Kelso.
- Michael Kelso.
Wait a minute.
Officer Debbie?
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?
You're like your own ugly sister!
What do you want, Mr. Kelso?
What do I want?
I want to know how one minute you're all "waa-waa" and the next you're all-  - Good cripes!
- Hey, now- I'm just saying, in your uniform you were, like, a totally hot police chick but out of your uniform you're a total pie face.
I mean, good God!
Wait a minute.
It's, like, you got all your charisma from your uniform.
What is happening to you?
Are you having a stroke?
What?
No, that's just how I look when I have an idea.
To Eddie.
Love, Hot Donna.
Hot Donna has now signed 87 guys!
And two girls.
It's, like, who knew, in our little town?
Well, I can see you got over your little bout of shyness.
Well, what the hell?
They think I'm hot.
And you know what?
- Hot Donna rules!
-  So, great news.
I got a job at First Midwestern Bank.
Oh, my God!
Eric.
I know.
And they have branches all over Wisconsin.
So wherever you go to school, I'll have a job.
I'll save some money.
I can start school, like, a year after you.
And I don't even have to slaughter animals.
Was that ever an option?
Ah, apparently it's the invisible industry of Point Place, yeah.
I'm actually surprised the streets aren't running red with blood.
Well, Steven, it is obvious you don't want a job.
No.
I was just holding out for one that has a cash register with a lock that's very, very easy to jimmy.
- Oh, God!
Excuse me.
- Oh, it's okay.
I probably deserved it.
- Roy.
- Steven?
Hey, man.
Long time no see.
When my dad left, my mom signed me up for the Big Brother program, and I got Roy.
We had some good times before you left town.
- Yeah, and moved in with a wonderful woman.
- Oh.
What happened?
She found out I was livin' there.
Roy has some problems with people.
They don't like me.
Yeah.
You don't like me, right?
Not really.
But to be fair, I have very high standards.
Yeah?
She's really nice, Steven.
Hey, so what are you doing here?
I work here.
Hotel kitchen manager.
I was gonna put out word that we were lookin' for a cook but then I figured, why bother?
They'll just leave me like everybody else.
So, Roy, seem a little depressed there.
Yeah, I'm teetering on the brink.
Maybe I can do something to cheer you up.
Really?
Oh, that'd be great.
So I'm on the Golden Gate Bridge and everyone's tellin' me to jump.
I was just out for a jog.
Okay, Roy, here's what I'm gonna do for you.
I'm gonna take that job as cook and keep you company on two conditions- I'm not gonna work very hard, and you're gonna have to pay me a lot.
But, man, it'll be a bargain considering the money you save on hookers and shrinks.
Great.
And if it's work-related, I can call you at home.
Now I have a reason to get a phone.
Steven, you're a chef!
If you can learn to make those fancy deviled-egg thingies I will lose my frickin' mind!
So, how's the day going?
Well, let's see.
I interviewed four cretins and a mama's boy.
I vote for the mama's boy.
I think they're sweet.
Hey, Dad!
Guess what.
I got a job at First Midwestern, so Donna and I can stay engaged.
I'll work, she'll study.
In a few years, I can pay for my own tuition.
Yea!
I win!
Great news!
I'm gonna be a cop!
No.
No, listen.
It's perfect for me.
The uniform will keep me looking hot even when I'm old.
And plus, I love helping people.
No, you love humping people.
Eric, a lot of times humping /s helping.
So, you're really gonna be a cop?
Well, he did shoot me, so we know he's good with guns.
And you just know they're gonna partner him up with a dog.
Actually, you know what?
It's kind of perfect.
He'll get to run through people's backyards with a stick.
He does that anyway.
The important thing is, is that I'll be performing a very valuable community service.
And plus, I'll be sexy forever.
I mean, just think about it.
Nobody move!
This is a robbery.
Not in my town, dirtbag.
Oh, Officer, not only did you perform a valuable community service you'll be sexy forever!
All in a day's work, ma'am.
Let's get you into something a little more comfortable.
- But I'm already in a bikini.
- I know.
Kelso, you do realize you'll have to help ugly people too.
Nah-uh.
I'll just leave that for the fat cops.
-  - Hey.
I just got off the phone with the bank.
I didn't get the job because someone gave me a bad reference.
And then I thought to myself "Hmm.
I've only had one boss-you"!
I can't believe you blackballed your own son!
As usual, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
So you're not even man enough to admit it?
You know what I think?
You're a bitter, old man who's so miserable in his life that you have to make everyone else just as miserable as you are!
- You're pathetic!
- Honey.
Your father didn't call the bank manager.
I did.
Mom, please stay out of this.
What was that?
- I gave you the bad reference.
- Oh.
Then, uh-  I'm just kidding.
Eric, if you take a bank job and put off school you'll never go to college, and the bank manager agreed with me.
Plus, I told him you were bad at math.
So there's no job money to pay for college no money from you guys to go to college.
Wow.
I guess we're really hoping for that football scholarship, huh?
I have a compromise.
Your father and I will pay for college if you and Donna will agree to just put off your engagement for one year.
I'm not compromising anything!
He said some hurtful things.
No.
I'm sick of being controlled by both of you guys.
You guys can keep your money, okay, 'cause guess what!
I don't want it.
Ma'am!
Sir!
We got a call about a domestic disturbance.
Get out of here.
Okay, but if I gotta come back out here, somebody's going downtown.
Well, quit it.
I'm just practicing.
A-And this is the pantry.
If you ever get really depressed, it's a good place to go and cry.
Also, it's where we keep the mustard.
All right.
Cool.
Well, uh, I guess I'll see you on Monday.
- Okay!
-  Okay, man.
Okay, Roy.
Get off me!
Oh, I almost forgot to show you the walk-in freezer.
A little privacy, please!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
-  -  It's the A-bomb!
Duck and cover!
I bet Eric's trying to sneak out.
Red, Red.
Wait.
Wait.
What if it's a burglar?
What's a burglar gonna steal from us?
My Shirley Temple figurines.
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have told Liz Anderson about them.
- Her nephew's been in jail, you know.
-  Oh!
Look at this.
Some guard dog.
You know, we could be trampled by Mongolians.
This thing wouldn't even wag its tail.
Hey.
L-l-I heard a scary noise.
Good God.
Are you nude?
No.
- I'm wearing my toga.
-  -  There it is again.
- That's it.
I'm gettin' my bat.
All right.
Calm down.
It's probably just Steven trying to sneak out.
What if it's not Steven?
What if the burglar has Steven?
Well, then we'll try to talk him into taking Eric too.
- Okay.
Let's do this.
- Look at him.
Bare-assed and holding a plastic bat.
That's your son, Kitty.
What kind of burglar robs people on a weeknight?
Doesn't he have a job to go to in the morning?
-  Jackie?
-  What the hell?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Forman, are you naked?
##  ##   Who the hell do you think you are bringing a girl into my house in the middle of the night?
And right in our basement.
We keep our Christmas decorations down there.
BabyJesus was watching.
- I told you to look where you were going.
- What idiot leaves a LEGO set right in front of the door?
You knocked over my space command center?
I spent three hours building that.
All right.
Now what is going on in my basement?
Jackie's been sleeping here the last couple of weeks.
Couple of weeks?
This is not the Playboy Mansion, you know.
- Look, nothing was going on.
- Nothing was going on?
Um, space command centers were ruined!
Would you please go put some pants on?
This is where I eat.
Jackie's only been staying here 'cause her dad's in jail - and her mom's still not back yet.
- Steven!
That's private.
Your mom's not back yet?
You told me she came home.
Could we not talk about this?
I'm fine.
Okay?
Everything is fine.
- If you need a place- - No, no, no.
I don't need anything.
I'm only here 'cause I am such a tramp.
So, I should just go home and try to control my dirty urges.
Jackie, you're not going home.
There's nobody there.
All right.
Look, Jackie.
Tonight you can sleep in Laurie's room and then tomorrow, we'll track down your floozy mother.
Honey, do you have any idea where she might be?
Well, the last postcard I got had a picture of some guy with a bone through his nose.
What is that, like, Tennessee?
Hey, Donna.
This just in: Your weirdo boyfriend sleeps in the nude.
Yeah?
So?
I do too.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I can see it now.
And it is glorious.
Excuse me.
Jackie, I can't believe your parents are gone.
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay, everybody needs to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
I mean, how could I not be?
Mrs. Forman did my hair and made me smiley-faced pancakes.
Eric, this house is like a shabby hotel with really great service.
Oh, hey, while you're visiting, here's my LEGO set and a picture of the space command center.
Okay?
Get building.
I swear to God, if my three-man escape pod doesn't fit the star bay heads are gonna roll.
I have a question.
If Hyde was in Hyde's bed and Jackie was in Hyde's bed what exactly was going on in said bed?
Nothing.
She needed a place to sleep.
"Needed a place to sleep".
Well, a bed is an interesting choice, now, wouldn't you say?
Oh, shut up, Michael.
It's not like we were doing it.
Oh, come on, Jackie.
You can't sleep in the same bed with someone and not be doing it.
I've fallen asleep not doin' it and woken up doin' it.
And that's why they won't put him to sleep at the dentist.
Guys, I don't know what's going on with Nina.
I keep asking to meet her parents, but she keeps making excuses.
It's probably the same reason I won't let you meet my parents.
She's afraid you're gonna say something weird and embarrass her.
Oh, please.
I'm a hot-looking, smooth-talking, frisky-assed son-of-a-bitch.
Hey, Fez.
Right there.
That's, like- That's, like, a really weird thing to say.
Yeah, I mean, we're used to you, but, dude, you're weird.
For Nina to let you meet her parents- I think what Kelso's trying to say is that maybe you don't make the best first impression.
Like, remember the first time you met my parents?
- Mom, Dad, this is Fez.
- Well, hello there.
He did what?
Yeah, and then it actually got even more disturbing.
Get this creepy bastard off me!
I never heard that story.
So how was Forman's mom?
Well, at first she was giving me nothing, but by the end she was giving me something.
Yeah!
She's spunky!
- Man, I'd kiss your mom.
- Oh, my God.
How could Jackie's mother abandon her only child?
I have half a mind to take this public.
We could go on Donahue.
No.
Go on Carson.
He's funnier.
One time, the animal guy was on his parrot dooked right on Johnny's head.
Dad, I think you're missing the point.
We need to find Jackie someplace to stay, you know where she won't be all alone.
I can get her a room at the hotel I work at.
No, Jackie is not staying in a hotel.
We have an empty room right here.
Kitty, every time we have an empty room, you wanna fill it up with a stray child.
You're like the old lady who lived in a shoe.
Did you just call me "old"?
Okay.
Okay.
Here's what I th/nk.
Oh, hey, everybody!
Mr. Nude has an opinion.
I'm sure we're all interested in what Mr. Nude has to say.
Floor's all yours Mr. Nude.
- Never mind.
- I guess he was just thinkin' about bein' nude.
What is wrong with you people?
There is nothing funny about a teenaged girl whose mother abandoned her.
You know, we're allJackie's got.
We can't just turn our backs on her.
Donna, you're right.
You tellJackie she can stay with us.
What?
No.
No, she can't stay with us.
- Sure.
She can stay in your room with you.
- But- Oh, you're all gonna pay for this!
I can't believe my dad's making me ask Jackie to move in with us.
This is gonna be a nightmare.
"Donna, where's your spirit"?
"Donna, you're still hungry"?
"Donna, your lumberjack head is blocking out the sun".
You know, I'm not too big.
She is too small.
Okay, just for the record I don't sleep nude for any disgusting reason.
I'm just a hot sleeper.
Okay, I'm not a hot sleeper.
I'm 17 years old.
I sleep right next door to the girl I love.
Things occur to me.
Okay?
If I'm already nude, you know- It just saves time.
Guys, Nina agreed to let me meet her parents.
And to seem completely normal I've come up with the perfect opening line for Nina's mother.
"Hello, Mrs. Bartel.
I can see where Nina gets her lovely ass".
You're so weird, man.
You know what?
There's a way around that.
I'm gonna make you so beautiful that Nina's parents don't notice how freakin' weird you are.
Bein' beautiful-That's how I get away with stuff.
Except my problem is I gotta tone it down 'cause otherwise the chick's mom gets interested.
Then we got a big problem.
Let's make you man-pretty.
Okay.
I've been thinking about what to do with Jackie.
I think we're overlooking the mobile home option.
Okay?
You could park her right in the driveway and we'll all know she's safe in her own little, steel box.
Donna, you have to let her stay with you.
Come on.
She's your best friend.
She's not my best friend.
Well, then, who's your best friend?
Oh, crap!
How the hell did that happen?
Oh, look.
Mr. Nude is helping.
Mr. Nude, huh?
That was my nickname in college.
Dad, you didn't go to college.
Didn't stop me from gettin' a nickname.
You all gonna be here for this?
I don't thinkJackie's gonna be cool with that.
Well, Steven, everybody needs support.
Like this one time, I left the supermarket in a really bad mood and then I met these very nice people, the Hare Krishnas.
They sang me a song.
They gave me some rice.
It was just the little pickup I needed.
You know, if I hadn't had to make dinner, I might've gotten into their van.
Yeah, those freaks were hasslin' me once too.
So when they weren't lookin', I stole five boxes ofThin Mints.
Kelso, those were Girl Scouts.
Whatever, man.
They were pushy.
Here comes Jackie.
Well, I think this is a big mistake.
When this blows up in your face, don't come lookin' for me.
I'll be bustin' up Forman's space station again.
Jackie!
Jackie, Donna has something she wants to ask you.
- Donna.
-  So, Jackie, we were all thinking that you might come stay with me for awhile since you're having such a hard time right now.
God!
I'm so sick of this!
I don't have hard times!
I'm Jackie Burkhart.
I got voted head cheerleader by the largest margin in cheerleader history.
I have a wonderful life.
- Yeah, but, Jackie, your dad's in prison, and your mom- - I'm sorry, Donna but you're just not popular enough for me to live with.
I'm not popular enough?
I was doing you a favor, 'cause I felt bad for you.
Well, don't.
Okay?
I don't need to be your good deed for the day.
Fine.
There's the door.
Don't let it hit your popular, little butt on the way out.
F-Fine.
Well, that was pretty hot.
And that is how you make a canoe out of banana skins.
Oh!
They love me.
See?
There's nothing to worry about.
- Great.
Then we should get going.
- Oh!
Oh!
Don't go.
Oh, it's such a pleasure having someone so exotic in our home.
We're so happy that Nina has made a friend of you, Fez.
Well, maybe it's because I'm so handsome and not at all creepy.
And, by the way, I see where Nina gets her lovely ass.
Hey, I was talking to you, Mr. Bartel.
Oh, my!
Honey, you are really broadening your horizons.
Having a friend like this is gonna look great on your college application.
Yes.
We always enjoy meeting Nina's friends.
You keep calling me her "friend".
Don't you mean, her "boyfriend"?
Boyfriend?
- What's so funny?
- You can't be her boyfriend.
- Why not?
- Because you're-What's the word, honey?
- "Different"?
- Okay.
Different.
Oh, I see.
- You mean, "not white".
- Fez, no.
I think I'll be leaving now.
Good day.
- Fez, wait.
- I said, "Good day".
By the way, I hope you do not have a good day.
And then when I asked her to live with me, she said I'm not freakin' popular.
Am I not on the radio all the time as "Hot Donna"?
Okay?
There are "Hot Donna" posters all over town, objectifying me.
Is Jackie being objectified?
No!
She only said that 'cause you embarrassed her in a roomful of people.
It was like a damn telethon in there.
The only thing missing was Jerry Lewis.
So, what, it's my fault, 'cause I didn't ask her right?
Okay.
How about when your mom left?
Think how you would've felt if you walked into a roomful of people everyone's talking about how sad your life is and how much they pity you.
- Yeah.
I guess I get that.
- I'm just sayin' that Jackie needs a place to stay, and it'd be really cool if you can ask her in a way that doesn't make her feel bad.
Fine.
But she didn't have to call me "unpopular".
Okay?
Unpopular girls don't get free Slurpees from Tommy at the 7-Eleven.
Donna, two years ago, Tommy tried to jump a school bus on his moped.
He didn't make it, and now he gives everyone free Slurpees.
So you see, Jackie, the reason I asked you to stay with me before is because, well, you were right.
I am unpopular.
Go on.
I'm, um, too tall and-and red hair is gross.
And, well, if I don't do something soon my unpopularity is gonna follow me to college- unless you help.
Please come stay with me.
Jackie-  Help me be more like you.
Well, as long as everybody knows I'm doing it for you - I'll do it.
- Great.
Hey, Donna.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Okay.
First things first.
If you wanna be more popular, you're gonna have to break up with Eric.
What?
You know, I have been called many names since coming to this country but I have never been treated like that before.
Look, Fez unfortunately, there are some people in this world that are gonna judge you on the color of your skin or your funny accent or that girlie little way you run.
But you know what?
You're not alone.
Why do you think the Martians won't land here?
'Cause they're green, and they know people are gonna make fun of'em.
You said it, brother.
I just wish there were someplace in the world where prejudice didn't exist.
Huh.
Well, that's Canada.
Yup.
Good old Canada.
They don't make generalizations about people 'cause they're too busy playing hockey or gettin' drunk or putting maple syrup on their ham.
- Fez, we need to talk.
- Hey!
He might not be from this country but he's beautiful, damn it!
Nina, our relationship is over.
My self-respect demands it and there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind.
My parents are jerks.
I wanna get back at them by doing it with you on their bed.
Except that.
Thanks, Kelso.
Fire!
Fire!
- What are you doing?
- Well, look at this.
Mr. Nude is still nude.
- You're nuts.
- Wow.
Strong words from Mr. Nude.
We're doin' this every night until you put on some bottoms.
Fire!
Fire!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Donna, you're so sweet for letting Jackie live here with you while her mom is- - You know.
- Whoring around Mexico?
Donna, that is not fair.
I think she left Mexico.
Well, you know, Jackie and I might have fun.
- Sort of like a slumber party.
- Mm-hmm.
Yes, late-night girl talk hot oil massages and the furtive whispers of, "We shouldn't"!
And then, "Shh!
It's okay"!
- Is that all you're bringing?
- Oh, um, just a couple more small things.
- Out of the way, Jackie.
- Comin' through!
Got a buttload!
Heavy.
Can't feel my fingers!
- Yup!
- Ooh.
Jackie's panties!
Hey, Hyde.
If these babies could talk, I bet they could tell some pretty good stories about me!
Yeah, I bet they'd have a French accent too.
My girlfriend's panties, Kelso?
Is that really a road you want to go down with me?
What's that, panties?
Oh, no!
I can't tell Hyde that one!
Naughty panties!
What's that, fist?
It would be my pleasure.
Here you go.
One general-issue military cot slightly used from my days in the National Guard.
Well, it's good to know that the National Guard was gettin' a good night's sleep while I was in the South Pacific dodgin' bullets and using coral as toilet paper!
So-  I don't think there's gonna be room for everything.
Oh, Donna, sure there will.
I only brought the stuff I absolutely needed.
All right.
Where goes the horse?
Guys, if I enroll in the police academy in the fall I could be bustin' heads in a year!
Freeze, dirtbag!
Wow, you did make me freeze.
But I was a dirtbag long before you came along.
Hey.
Says here you're supposed to start getting into shape now.
No, no, that's not for me.
That's for the regular guys.
I haven't done a lap in gym class since I had my eighth-grade growth spurt and Miss Brady made me her special assistant.
Guys!
Look at this.
I just got another collection letter from the jewelry store about Donna's engagement ring.
- I gotta get some money, or I'm screwed.
- There's a job at the hotel.
My boss would have hired ya.
Then he talked to Red.
I gotta do something.
This is a threatening letter.
"Call us immediately"?
It's-It's in all capital letters.
Look at you.
Another dirtbag dodgin' his responsibilities.
Not on my beat.
Game over, dirtbag!
Man, I wish I had some handcuffs.
Here, use mine!
I'm learnin' to do magic!
##  ##    Jackie.
I thought you were gonna put everything away.
I did.
The hardest thing was finding room for my shoes.
But then I realized I could just fit them inside your shoes.
Uh-huh.
Look, let's just get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jackie!
Turn that off!
-  - ##  See, Donna, I need music to fall asleep.
See, I wear earplugs so I can just barely hear it but it needs to be loud enough, because I like the vibration in the bed.
So, how am I supposed to get to sleep?
Think of something boring.
You know, like school.
Or Eric.
##  Hey.
I sold some of my albums to get some money for Donna's engagement ring.
Made three bucks.
Which means I am- Let me see, carry the one, um- Oh!
Still completely screwed.
They wouldn't take Anne Murray's Greatest Hits?
Is this whole crazy world turning upside down?
Be nice to Anne, okay?
She's a beloved Canadian songstress.
And I'm glad they didn't take her, because- Well, the worse I feel, the more I need her.
Why do you have money?
What'd you do, mug a Girl Scout?
No, I've been selling my albums.
Oh, I hope you didn't sell that "Froggy Went A-courtin"' record.
You know, when we were toilet-training Eric I'd say, "Does someone need to go a-courtin'"?
And he would just run straight off and make a jobby.
-  -  You know, it occurs to me that since I paid the allowance that bought those records in the first place, that money's mine.
It occurs to me that possession is 9/10ths of the law.
Keep up with the smart mouth, and my foot'll be 9/10ths of the way up your ass.
You know, Forman, you should write a book: Things My Father Threatened To Put In My Ass.
"Chapter One: His Foot".
I'd buy that.
- Ew!
- Donna, don't you knock?
Not when it's my room!
Well, we're in here, so- Yeah, well, I'm in here, so- Hey, if you want to watch, I can get into that.
Have a seat on the horse.
- Hey, how was your weekend, Roy?
- Aw, pretty good.
Think I might have met a woman.
- Aw, that's great, man.
- She's stayin' at the hotel.
When I took butter to her table, she looked right at me and said "Took you long enough".
Huh?
-  - All right!
Here I am!
Oh, Steven, meet our new kitchen assistant.
You hired Kelso?
Do you know how many fires this guy's started?
Three electrical, two chemical, and one that even surprised me.
Well, I wanted to help him out, and he said he needed a job.
Yeah, if I'm gonna be a cop, I gotta quit modelin', I mean- I can't have the perps lookin' at pictures of me half-naked.
Oh, and, uh, everywhere I work, I like to feel at home so I brought a little somethin' ofJackie's.
Okay, uh, I think that's a health code violation.
But I'm gonna look the other way, which is hard to do, 'cause- Look, panties!
Yeah, I burned you with the panties again!
Two days, two locations.
That burn is on tour.
Yeah.
I guess Roy didn't make things clear, but, um all new hires are on probation.
So at the end of the week, I get to say whether you stay or go.
Yeah, nice try.
No, I'm serious, man.
It's all up to me.
So you might want to try and get on my good side.
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
- Yes, may I help you?
Oh.
Hello, Fez.
Fenton.
- You two know each other?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- There's nothing to say.
- You can say that again.
- Don't tell me what to do.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Maybe I would!
- Then there's nothing to say!
Yeah.
Um, I have a question about this letter.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to make a ring payment anytime soon so I was wondering if we could work out some kind of deal.
Fine.
Here's a deal.
Come up with the money by Friday or bring the ring back to the store.
What?
Bring the ring back?
No, I can't do that.
You can and you will.
No later than 5:00.
I have a party at 8:00.
I need the time to dress.
Eric, you're going to want to do what he says.
I've been at the other end of Fenton's stick, and that's not a place you want to be.
Who am I kidding?
After I can't pay for Donna's ring, no one's gonna be in love with me, honey.
Must you mock me, Anne Murray?
Kelso, because of your panty shenanigans I'm banning you from the circle.
I hereby ban you!
I also hereby eat your burrito.
Hey, Hyde?
You're not the boss of me!
All right.
Well, you can't tell me what to do.
Shoot.
Well-Well, at least I'm still my own man.
No, I'm not!
-  -  What do you supposeJackie and Donna are doing in the room right now?
Combing each other's hair?
Applying moisturizer to their "all-overness"?
Oh, to be a fly in that poop.
All I know is I gotta go tell the woman I love that the ring I gave her for all eternity was actually for only six-and-a-half weeks.
Life's more complicated than one of your simple little ditties, isn't it, Anne Murray?
Anne Murray.
- What do you know about hard times?
- ##   Canada?
You wanna borrow our shower?
Jackie used up all our hot water bathing her dolls.
Normally, I'd rather hose off in the driveway than ask you for a favor but I'm afraid Bob'll want to act out some car-wash fantasy.
You got me there!
Come on, Jo-Jo.
We can save water if we soap up together.
And when they're done, I'm retiling the whole damn bathroom.
Okay, so you're absolutely positive that my hairnet has to be pink?
It's gotta match your apron.
You're pretty.
Jackie, if you're gonna stay here, we need to set up a few ground rules.
Okay?
You can't just- What happened to our Led Zeppelin poster?
Oh!
I put up the Captain and Tennille instead.
No, no, no, no.
No way is my Led Zeppelin becoming the Captain and Tennille.
Led Zeppelin wishes they could be the Captain and Tennille.
What did you say?
Hey, Donna.
Um, I need to talk to you for a second.
-  - Um I have been thinking all day-  About your eyes.
What?
Yeah, your eyes.
They're so beautiful and shiny.
You now what else is shiny?
This diamond ring, which has to go back to the store because it isn't paid for.
Because you can put a price tag on a ring, but, you know who can put a price tag on your eyes?
Only God, that's who.
- You're taking back my ring?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
L- Man, I wish there were another way, but my dad won't let me have a job, and- I mean, I can't make the payments.
God, I'm really sorry.
Oh, it's okay, Eric.
I mean, it doesn't change the way we feel about each other.
As long as we have that, I don't need a silly ring.
Um, Donna you didn't give me the ring.
Yeah, l- I thought you'd think I did.
All right.
Donna, I promise.
- I'm gonna make this up to you.
- 'Kay.
Um, Donna, you gave me a quarter.
Mmm, fine.
Hello, Mr. Forman.
And you.
- Shut your filthy mouth!
-  Look, here it is.
Here's the ring back.
- Oh, honey, that's paid for.
- What?
Someone came in and paid through the end of next month.
I'm not supposed to say who, but she sure was a pretty little number.
I guess.
You know what?
It was Donna.
I can't believe she'd go behind my back like this!
I cannot believe that this man would go behind my back and take what was given to me by God himself.
All right.
What happened between you two anyway?
I'm too much of a man to say.
But it involved a half-off sale a crowded parking lot, and a pair of pants to make my ass look like an oil painting.
If you mean, "old and cracked," then I agree!
- I'll see you in hell!
- Well, I'll be wearing your pants!
Okay, I'm feeling a little "in the way" here so- I'm ju- I'm-  Oh, Roy.
Hey, how's it goin' with that hotel chick that was all over you, asking for butter?
Well, I had this idea to surprise her with flowers?
But when I did, she started screamin' and hittin' me.
And I guess the lesson is, don't hide in someone's shower.
I don't know what's wrong with chicks, man.
If I came home and some strange girl was in my shower that would be the greatest day of my life!
Yeah!
- So, w-what are you doin'?
- Oh, Hyde's makin' me do his laundry.
Then after this, I gotta clean out the toilets and hand-test all the mousetraps.
This probation period is killin' me.
Did Hyde tell you there was a probation period?
Aw, man!
That guy really knows how to enjoy life!
Wait.
You mean, Hyde's just messin' with me?
- I don't have to worry about gettin' fired?
- If I didn't get fired for hidin' in some woman's shower, I think your job's secure.
Hey, guys.
Kelso, be careful, huh?
Some of those T-shirts are delicate.
Oh, I'm- I'm sorry, man.
I'll be extra careful.
I wouldn't want to do anything to screw up my probation period!
Hey!
I wanna play!
Ah!
Come on, buddy.
Somebody spray me.
Hey, Hyde.
Maybe you could use these to dry off with.
Probation period!
Jackie read my diary, Mrs. Forman.
And she even wrote little comments inside.
Yeah.
Like, "Oh!
This could never happen".
And-And, "Donna, that guy was whistling at me, not you".
I can't take it anymore!
I'm kicking her out.
But, Donna, the poor girl has nowhere to stay.
She can't stay here!
She can't stay anywhere near here.
Bob was in our shower again.
This morning, I pulled something out of our drain that I could not believe came off a human body.
Oh!
Donna.
There you are.
Okay, look.
We have to talk about your makeup collection.
ChapStick is not lipstick.
Jackie, sit down.
Look.
We need to talk about you and me living together.
- Donna!
- Because it's just- I just came from the jewelry store.
You can't pay for your own engagement ring!
This ring is from me to you, not from me to you, paid for by you.
That's like cutting off my bal- lerina shoes.
- I didn't pay for the ring.
- Fenton at the jewelry store said a pretty little number- Oh, my God.
Mom?
You're the pretty little number.
Well, l- I do like hearing that once in a while.
- But i-i-it wasn't me.
- Well, I don't know, Dad some men might consider you- - You just can't stop talkin', can you?
- Eric, I paid for the ring.
- What?
- What?
Look, Donna, I read in your diary that you think I'm kind of hard to live with, and well, I realized you were right.
And I wanted to show you that I know, and I'm sorry.
- And, well, thank you.
- Huh.
Well, gosh, Jackie, how very sweet, and uncharacteristic of you.
Well, I know how much you love that ring and I wanted to do something nice.
- Wow, thanks.
-  You know, Jackie, some people, if they want to be nice they just actually start being nicer on a day-to-day basis.
Yeah, I figured it'd be easier to write a check.
- Jackie!
Jackie!
- Hmm?
I heard something underneath my bed.
- Fez?
-  Meow!
Fez, the cat's outside.
Woof, woof?
Please, let me stay.
I promise I won't make a sound.
Well, I do make some sounds, but they're happy sounds!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I'm telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man.
They just don't want us to know, because then we'd buy all the water.
Then there'd be nothing left to drink but beer.
And the government knows that beer will set us free.
Hyde, you told us about the car a million times.
Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am?
I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
Or a pizza made of boobs!
Yeah, hungry, check.
Horny, check.
It's getting a little old, Fez.
God, I feel like I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?
Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's water farm all day.
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
Boring.
Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap!
Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown.
And when I frown, my skin wrinkles.
And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over.
And I like my free ride!
Yeah, we get it.
You're good looking.
Look, doesn't anybody have anything new to say?
So there's this car that runs on water, man.
It runs on water, man!
Okay, Nina, I brought you the special.
One small soda, one medium popcorn and one large Fez, dark and sweet.
Fez, you know I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you.
Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact.
It would've been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize.
Now enjoy your meal.
If you need me, I'll be smelling your neck.
Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel like I need some space.
But I want you to know it's not you, it's me.
Okay.
Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing.
That's sort of gross.
Hey, it may be gross, but that's the way I learned how to count.
##  ##   Six Million Dollar Man.
That's like a $20 jumpsuit and a $4 haircut.
Mmm.
Where did all the money go?
I think we've seen this episode.
Yeah.
And we were sitting in these exact same seats when we saw it.
Actually, you were sitting over there.
I remember, 'cause I could see up your skirt.
You guys, we do the exact same thing every day.
TV, snack, nap.
It's- You know what?
This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.
I know something new we could do.
Jackie, Donna, get naked.
The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
- Hello, friends of Fez.
- Hi.
Where's Nina?
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.
-  Ooh!
- Uh-oh.
That's the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she's dumping you.
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.
-  Oh!
- That ain't good.
- Oh, what's the big deal?
- Oh, man, I can't tell him.
This is a job for someone who's cold, heartless and just inhuman.
Jackie, go for it.
Fez, when a girl says, "It's not you, it's me" what she really means is it's you.
- So I have really been dumped.
-  Yep.
And here's another tip.
When a girl says she just wants to be friends it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she's not gonna put out.
So, you know, heads-up on that one.
Yep.
Women'll screw you over every chance they get.
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.
So, Hadji's girlfriend finally came to her senses.
What happened?
She didn't wanna be a fifth wife?
- Hadji.
- All right.
Well, it's her loss.
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life.
Look at us.
We're hanging out with my parents.
Yeah, about that.
Feel free to get the hell out.
Well, we can do better than this.
You guys, we're gonna graduate in two months and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us.
We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns.
Okay, but I tell you this from experience.
If we're gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan.
Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight?
Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around with their parents giving them snarky looks.
I remember when the Brady kids got bored and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.
Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!
You know, instead of adding someone maybe you should think about weeding out a few.
Like you and you and you.
- I'm your son.
- I can't play favorites.
You know, if you're looking for a new friend, how about Lance Crawford?
He's such a nice boy.
Mom, Lance Crawford and I hate each other.
You're just obsessed with getting his mother's peach cobbler recipe.
Well, what kind of a woman keeps a recipe a secret?
If that recipe were the polio vaccine, we'd all be in wheelchairs!
I don't like Lance Crawford.
He's always staring at me in this really creepy way.
And this one time, I saw him fiddling around in my locker.
When I opened it, there was a rose inside, and my gym socks were missing.
Donna, a little advice.
You're not gonna want those socks back.
I can't think of anyone new I wanna hang out with.
All the girls I know are either too snobby or too slutty.
Yeah, I'm not good with the snobs, but slutty's my bread and butter.
You know, what we need are people with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman.
He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.
- Sold it last week.
- That punk.
He's out.
Hey, Carrie Gerber has a trampoline.
Carrie Gerber also has a big, hairy mole.
I don't wanna be bouncing around and get tangled up in that.
Eric.
Eric.
Honey, there's someone here to see you.
Mom, if it's another one of Dad's Marine Corps recruiters, I'm gonna run away.
I swear.
Lance Crawford?
Mom!
Hello, Eric.
Your father and I were just discussing how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation.
- I'll get some sodas.
- No, please.
Allow me.
Why don't you stay here and chat with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.
Yes, I'd love to explain the practical impossibility of the so-called light saber.
You son of a bi- Red alert, you guys.
Red alert!
Lance Crawford is in the building!
- I'm gettin' the hell outta here!
-  Wait, wait, wait.
- What if he sees us sneaking out?
- Oh, Donna leave one of your socks behind.
What?
It'll distract him.
Nina, I thought we were so happy together.
What happened?
Fez, right now I'm at a point in- Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker.
I want the truth!
Okay, the truth is you're too needy.
Too needy?
I'm sorry, but a man in his sexual prime has needs.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
No, your needs are fine.
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
Oh, poor Fez.
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
You guys, we gotta cheer him up.
- Knock first.
If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants.
Oh, awesome!
Wait.
Let's catch him.
- Oh, wow.
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
Oh, my God.
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
Fezzie, come on out.
I can't.
I'm not wearing pants.
Told you!
Nina told me why she dumped me.
She said I was too needy.
Am I too needy?
Tell me!
I need to know!
Fez, I'm sorry, man.
You're the definition of needy.
Remember, one time, you called me at 3:00 in the morning just to make sure we were still friends?
Look, if you wanna get Nina back, you gotta act like you don't care.
- But I don't know how to do that.
- Well, we can help you.
Oh!
We'll rebuild you like the Six Million Dollar Man!
Fez One to Control.
We have liftoff.
All systems are go.
Proceed to eat candy.
-  - Uh-oh.
Emergency!
Emergency!
We are breaking up.
I repeat, Nina and I are breaking up.
Fez, a teenager, a boy with needs.
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
We have the technology.
We can make him more appealing to Nina by making him less needy.
We can make him cooler, suaver, aloofer.
"Aloofer"?
Is that even a word?
We can make it one.
We have the technology.
- Initiate female reaction sequence.
- Release the girls.
Hey, Fez, looking good.
Love the outfit.
Totally bionic.
You mean nothing to me.
Oh, no.
He's no longer needy.
And because of that, I want him even more.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- Terrific job.
-  Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- Whoa.
Doctor.
- Whoa.
Doctor.
Oh, I see.
In order to get Nina I have to act like I don't need her.
Well, fine.
I don't need Nina.
I don't need women.
- I don't need anything!
-  Oh!
Eric sure is taking an awfully long time with those sodas.
I'm sure it's no reflection on you, Lance.
He probably just wants to make sure a good friend like you gets the freshest soda available.
I know Eric doesn't like me, Mrs. Forman.
I only came over for the chance to see my beautiful Donna.
And after I make my fortune in robots I'm gonna come back to this Podunk town and buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at fire him, and make Donna my wife.
You're a creepy kid.
You know that?
Mrs. Forman, I think we both know the real reason you invited me over here.
You're after Mother's coveted peach cobbler recipe, no?
Your mom makes peach cobbler?
I had no idea.
Please, let's speak frankly.
I have something you want, and you have something I want.
W-We're not in a- in a position to just give you Donna.
We could give you Eric.
Mother tasted your stuffing at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot and ever since then she's wanted the recipe.
I've been instructed to arrange a swap.
Don't you have any weird friends to play with?
Friends are for the weak.
Okay, you guys.
MeetJulie.
She's got two horses, a brand-new Firebird and her dad works for Six Flags!
Hello, Julie!
Hey, Hyde.
Love your hair.
You can touch it if you want.
Oh, get lost, skankoid.
We're all full.
Damn, Jackie!
She's got a Firebird and two horses!
We could've raced 'em!
All right.
That's it.
I'm gonna go askJake Bradley.
I know.
We've all been thinking it, but no one's had the guts to ask him 'cause he's the quarterback, and we're a bunch of jelly heads.
But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.
And that star is Jake Bradley!
Jake Bradley!
All right, Fez.
There's Nina.
Now remember, you're a new man.
You don't need her or anything else.
- Got it.
I am cooler, suaver, aloofer.
- There you go.
- Oh, hi, Fez.
- Oh, you wish, baby.
Why don't you take your "Hi, Fez" act and try it on someone else?
'Cause I don't need it.
- Nice work, Fez.
- Shut up.
I don't need your accolades.
How can you give away your stuffing recipe, Kitty?
It's the one thing that we have that's better than everyone else's.
Our house?
Crappier.
Our son?
Crappier.
Our stuffing?
Better!
Okay, Lance.
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
Oh, you be sure to say hi.
Such a nice lady.
Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade.
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
Please, just take the fries.
You need me to take them, don't you?
Needy bastard.
Hi, Fez.
Can I talk to you?
Oh, you need permission, do you?
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
You know what, Nina?
There's only one Fez and that is a Fez with needs.
And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together.
- But, Fez, l- - Shh!
Sorry, baby.
It's over.
Oh, and, Nina, it's not me, it's you.
Ladies ofThe Hub why do we try to act like we have no needs?
I have needs.
For instance, I need a date for Saturday night.
Any takers?
You, blondie.
You there, with the glasses.
What about the redhead trying to cover her face?
Hey.
So I went to see Jake Bradley- You mean-  Jake Bradley?
Yes.
To see if he wanted to hang out.
And you know what Mr. Cool Guy was doing?
Just hanging out in his basement with his friends and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
It was eerie.
Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick who's way out of his league?
You know, there was.
Wait.
Does this mean we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?
No, man.
We don't need anyone else.
You know what?
We've only got two months until graduation and we can't waste a second of that.
Forman's right.
Let's seize the day, man.
Hey, weren't we supposed to seize something, man?
You know what the Six Million Dollar Man should have?
A bionic nose.
You could smell everything!
Guys, all I know is that we should really appreciate this 'cause I don't think we're gonna be able to do this in college.
This peach cobbler is amazing!
Now, who would leave a whole pan of peach cobbler just sitting on a counter?
See?
We don't need anyone else.
We have lots of interesting things to say.
Right?
Hey, there's this car that runs on water.
It runs on water, man!
-  -  Careful.
I know it looks like a race car, but it's really a bed.
Please don't make a mess.
The maid doesn't come until Thursday.
Watch it!
That is a present from my cousin in Hong Kong.
Who has been dropping Milk Duds on my carpet?
Who has been dropping Milk Duds on my carpet?
Screw this.
I'm going to Eric's.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Ah, the annual nurses' convention.
You know, according to my bathroom reading all nurses are actually horny for high school boys.
Why do you think those hospital gowns have no backs?
So the nurses can check out your ass.
Look at this sexy stampede.
It's like Wild Kingdom.
I will stalk their sexy herd like a lion.
I cannot run as fast, but let's see a lion put on this much cologne.
Oh, look, Red!
All of my colleagues gathered together to talk about health and medicine.
And to drink until their livers turn into cocktail onions.
- Red, it is not that bad.
- Yeah?
What about last year when you and your buddies took the bellboy's pants?
Well, they were all wet.
Because you threw him in the pool!
- Oh, hey, Roy.
- Hi, guys.
Oh, st-stay away from this batch of egg rolls.
- They were on the floor.
- Oh, you dropped 'em?
No, I was lying down.
You know, if I were God, this is what heaven would be like- pretty girls in white and free egg rolls.
Fez, I thought you said heaven would be French maids with licorice hair and gumdrop nipples.
Oh, no, that's my 30th birthday.
Hi there.
- So, do you work here?
- Yeah, I'm stuck here all night.
That's good.
'Cause I'll probably be doin' some things I'll regret later.
If you're interested.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I have a girlfriend.
What a coincidence.
I have a room.
You know, I don't have a girlfriend.
But I have, uh, written several love letters to Barbara Walters, so, uh- Oh, Roy, you're goin' after the wrong ones, man.
You gotta think like a lion and pick off the weakest member of the herd.
Well, like that one, with the braces and the desperate eyes.
Oh, she's not makin' it past sundown.
Aw!
Look at him.
All tuckered out from a day of chasing nurses.
Yeah, he's like a gigantic, horny baby.
I bet he's havin' sweet dreams.
Welcome to the clinic for sexy foreigners.
Tell me where it hurts, baby.
Oh, I have a bad case of horniness for nurses.
What you need is a sexy sponge bath.
I like the way you operate.
How's that?
- It's not bad.
- But I sure am.
Yes, you are, naughty nurse.
Maybe you need a little spanking.
Maybe I do.
Now, why don't you turn your head and cough?
Aah!
- Oh, what's the problem, buddy?
- Aah!
- What's the problem, buddy?
- Aah!
##  ##   So, anyways, Eric, me and Joanne feel real bad since Red fired you.
So, we decided to get you a job on account of we're pretty sure you're not gonna be successful on your own.
Isn't that great?
See, now you can save up for school, and we can get married.
Wow.
I had heard crazy rumors that sometimes parents help children but I just always thought it was some kind of beautiful fairy tale.
A position opened up at my company, and it's yours if you want it.
Oh, my God!
I'll take it.
This is great!
Yep.
She's as generous in real life as she is in the sack.
Wow, that's wildly inappropriate.
So, Joanne, about my new job-  - I don't even know where you work.
- The dog-food factory.
The- The dog-food factory!
I didn't see that comin'.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was brutal!
How can nurses wolf down mini pizzas right after watching a film strip on butt rashes?
Yeah.
No, I know.
Michael and I were hangin' at The Hub - and he told me it's been tough.
- What?
No, no, no.
You don't need to be hangin' out with Kelso alone.
- Why not?
- Because I don't trust him.
Yeah, but don't you trust me?
No!
Haven't you been paying attention?
I don't trust anything.
I don't trust the government.
I don't trust the newspapers.
I'm not even sure what time we think it is right now is really what time it is.
But most of all, I don't trust you and Kelso alone together.
All right.
You know what?
I guess I deserve that.
So, I promise I won't be alone with Michael anymore.
However, I do think you're making a big deal out of nothing.
That's what you said after you yelled "get off my boyfriend" - when you saw Kelso kissing Annette.
- Okay, what do I have to do to get you to stop bringing that up?
I'm not doing that.
Then I'm gonna keep bringin' it up.
All right!
Let's play some ball.
Why would you slap me on the butt?
Is there something about me that would make you think that I, a boy, would like you, another boy, to put his hand on my butt?
Uh, no?
Then keep your hands to yourself, butt-slapper.
-  - Okay.
- Let's just play some ball.
- Yeah.
All right.
Me and Fez are shirts.
You and Donna be skins?
Once again, Kelso, you're not gonna fool me into being skins.
Loosen up, Big "D".
Fine!
We'll be skins!
Oh, look at Mr. Handsome taking his shirt off.
As if that were something that I would dream about.
Okay, what is your problem, man?
It's just- Okay.
Um has anyone ever had a dream where you were with a girl?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Miss October.
- Hey!
- And-And you know what I said to her?
I said, "Get the hell out of my dream, Miss October.
I'm Donna's man".
Now, has any of you ever had a dream where you were with the opposite of a girl?
Like two girls?
Sure.
No.
See, I had a dream and it was erotic and it was about Kelso.
- What?
- Wow!
Wow!
That is awesome!
Fez, you gotta tell us about this dream.
Wh- No!
You don't gotta!
Look at him!
He's undressing me with his eyes right now!
You undressed yourself, you son of a bitch!
Fez.
Tell us what happened.
And-And don't be afraid to use colorful words like "sweaty" or "fondle" or "forbidden".
- Go ahead.
- Well Kelso was a nurse.
And there was sponging.
Oh!
But, hey, maybe- maybe the dream continued, and we went to find some girls.
- Well, did it continue?
- No!
What could this mean?
Well, isn't it obvious?
It means that I'm gay!
Why is the dog on the counter?
He likes to be tall.
Where are you off to, honey?
Oh, I'm off to a little thing I like to call my new job.
That's right.
Despite both your best efforts to keep me and Donna from getting married I can now afford to, because I got a new job at the dog-food factory.
Dog food!
Well, you finally made it, Son!
Hey, I'll have you know I am the coupon liaison.
Do you even know what you're getting yourself into?
When I pass that factory on my way home from fishing I hold a dead fish up to my face, so I don't have to smell it.
Seriously.
Honey, dog food?
That is the worst part of the cow.
You won't last the day.
-  - I will last the day.
And you know what?
Donna and I are getting married.
And I'm sorry, but just because of your attitude no one here will be getting the employee family discount on Pupper Supper.
Thank you very much.
Jackie!
- I need to talk to you!
- No.
No, no.
You have to go.
I cannot hang out with you anymore.
I promised.
Jackie, I need to talk to you.
Something happened that could tear apart the group!
I don't care.
Okay?
You have to go right now.
Jackie, Fez had a sex dream about me.
You poor baby!
What if he's in love with me?
I don't know that I can return those feelings.
No, of course you can't.
I mean, sure, he's supercool and he's good looking and we have a ton in common.
- But I can't- - I know.
I know, baby.
I know.
I just wonder what I did to make this happen.
I mean, should I have tried to be less desirable?
Michael, the beautiful cannot be held responsible for the havoc our looks create.
- That's true.
- Aw.
Come here.
No one understands me like you do, Jackie.
I told Jackie I don't want her hangin' out with Kelso.
I walk in, they're playing couch Twister.
And I don't know if something just happened or something was about to happen.
But you know what?
I don't care anymore.
- Have you talked to her?
- No!
Come on, man.
I'm done talkin'.
I'm just glad I saw them.
Now I can be the bigger person and bail before she does.
Yeah, that's what I should've done with Lauren.
And Susan.
And Janice.
Ah, who am I kiddin'?
I'm just makin' these names up.
Hey, Roy.
I just need to grab my check.
Hey, Kelso, what the hell were you doin' with my girlfriend on Donna's couch?
Huh?
That wasn't me.
I saw you!
Oh.
Uh- Uh, well- Okay, look.
It wasn't what you think.
Um, it was totally different.
See, Fez had this sex dream about me.
And I was, like, a nurse in it.
And I was totally freakin' out, and Jackie was just comforting me.
I mean, 'cause, you know-  Fez had a sex dream about me.
So your story is that you were with Jackie because Fez had a boy-on-boy dream about you?
It's crazy, huh?
Kelso, that is the worst lie you've told since you claimed to be the prince of South Carolina.
No, I'm not lying about Fez's dream!
Wh- I was sponging him!
It's the truth!
Hey, I believe people have dreams about you, man.
I mean, put a blond wig on, you're Goldie Hawn.
I know that.
Oh, Mr. Red.
I need some advice.
I had an erotic dream about Kelso.
Well, Joanne, thank you for the factory tour.
So, um, where is the coupon liaison office?
You're standing in it.
Well, it's big.
And, look, you have a window.
Maybe someday you can climb up there and look out.
Joanne, what exactly is the coupon liaison?
Oh, oh!
Look, girls, there's the boys!
Hands off though.
They're minors.
Mrs. Kitty we need your medical expertise.
Honey, if you've got V.D., I'm not looking at it.
No!
Fez had a dream and-  And I was doin' stuff to him in it.
And I don't want to do it again!
I'm scared to let him go to sleep!
See, Kelso was a nurse.
And I had no shirt.
And he had a sponge.
A soft one!
Okay, boys dreams are- are just compilations of what you experience during the day.
- What did you do yesterday?
- Um, Kelso and I looked at nurses.
Um, oh, and I ate 39 spicy egg rolls that were on the floor.
Well, spicy foods- there you go.
You know, one time, I ate stuffed peppers before I went to bed and I dreamt that I ended a war by giving the prime minister a belly dance.
So my dream didn't mean anything!
Oh, thank God!
I mean, I love you, Fez, just not in that way.
And my appreciation for your beauty is purely aesthetic.
You know what, Fez?
Maybe right now is not a great time for you to be complimentin' my ass.
Well, if it isn't the conquering hero home from a big day of dog food.
Hey, I had a great day, okay?
And by the way, I'm nowhere near the actual food.
I'm off with, like, the executives.
-  - Really?
Well, Schotzie sure does love the smell of executives.
Okay, look.
Okay, maybe Eric is working with dog food but he's not complaining, and he's not quitting.
And we're gonna get married no matter what you think or how he smells.
Aw, thanks, honey.
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.
Look at you.
You got that great dog-food job now and plenty of dog-food money comin' in, and- I mean, you two are happy, right?
- Very happy.
- Yes.
- Of course you are.
And that's why I've changed my mind.
This promising new career in dog food has convinced me that you two are mature enough to get married.
What?
A-Are you serious?
Absolutely.
Hey, let's get you happy kids hitched as soon as possible.
Like next week.
Next week?
Wow, that's- that's really soon.
Yeah, l- Sooner than we thought.
We were thinkin', like - someday.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, someday.
That's good.
- Yeah.
Well, what's the matter?
I mean, uh gettin' engaged is a silly, fun thing to do but now that we're talking about an actual wedding you're turning into a couple of dumb-ass kids who aren't ready?
'Cause, I mean, if you're not ready- Heck, I got myself all excited for nothin'.
No, no.
We're ready.
We are more than ready.
We're ready?
Yeah.
I mean- Well, I am if you are.
Well, yeah.
Sure, I'm completely ready.
Well, that's great.
You know, it's all settled.
I'll just- I'll go call the cake shop right now.
So, it's, uh, a wedding.
- Next week.
- Right.
- Oh, I have some homework- - Yeah, I gotta clean my room.
Hey, Roy, where's Steven?
You know, I haven't seen him all day.
You got a lot of nerve showin' your face around here.
Hyde saw you and Kelso snuggled up on the couch.
Tramp.
- Wait.
What?
- Yeah, I said, "tramp".
Oh, my God.
I have to find Steven.
Uh, d-don't tell him I called you a tramp.
I betJackie's been foolin' around with Kelso this whole time.
I feel like an idiot.
Oh, my poor, little broody-brood.
You know, when I first met you you were such a cute, little guy.
And now you're- you're a great, big guy with- with great, big hair and- and great, big problems my little broody-brood.
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
There.
You may leave me now.
Hey there.
Still have that girlfriend?
- You know what?
I don't know.
- Hmm.
Let's go talk about it.
Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman, have you seen Steven?
Oh, honey, I've had a couple sips of wine, and I don't remember.
Oh, but you know what you need?
You need more umbrellas in your hair.
Oh, bartender, we're gonna need more umbrellas.
Welcome to the clinic for sexy Kelsos.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm here for my supersexy sponge bath.
But I have money, so if you do other stuff too- Oh, I'll do anything you want.
You're one good-lookin' stud!
Right back at ya, handsome.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Well, how are you the morning?
Well, my baby boy's still engaged.
My hot flashes are back, so I feel like I'm standing in a pool of burning lava.
They don't make a pill for menopause, so I took a Flintstone vitamin.
And when you take a pill shaped like Barney Rubble it's pretty obvious the freakin' thing ain't gonna work!
Great.
Anyway, about the engagement I've got Eric and Donna on the ropes.
I dared them to get married next week.
They were shaking like France.
Well, I know you like scaring children, but what's the point?
Well, the point is if we let them do what they want they'll realize they don't wanna do it.
I mean, hell, nobody wants to be married.
Except me to you.
I'd do that all over again.
Oh, is Steven here?
He saw me on the couch with Michael, but there was nothing going on.
God, what do I do if he doesn't believe me, Mr. Forman?
- When in the hell did this start?
- I don't know.
The kids all used to run from me.
That's the way I liked it.
-  - Well, next fall, you'll get your wish.
Eric will be in college, and then the whole house will be empty.
That's right.
We're only one good-bye away from heaven.
Mommy, Daddy, I'm home!
We gotta start lockin' that door.
-  - No way!
##  ##   - Donna.
Hey.
- Hi.
Okay.
If you had bad news that could hurt someone that you cared about, what would you do?
Kelso, just leave the poor girl an anonymous note and tell her she needs a shot of penicillin.
Donna.
Okay.
Someone I know cheated on someone else I know.
Did Eric cheat on me?
I will snap that little monkey like a twig!
But no!
Donna.
God, Eric didn't cheat on you.
- Hyde cheated on Jackie.
- What?
Oh, my God!
Yeah!
And he doesn't know it, but I saw him kissing this lady in the hotel.
- Oh, my God.
That is horrible.
- I wanna do the right thing, right?
So I'm thinking that I'll just tellJackie.
And then she'll feel really bad, and I'll console her and presto!
We'll be making out topless.
No, Kelso.
The thing to do is to tell Hyde that you know and then give him a chance to tellJackie.
I knew you'd say that.
You know, just once I want the right thing and the topless thing to be the same thing.
Well, if it isn't the lovebirds.
So, lovebirds, how are the big wedding plans coming along?
Well, I've decided to be the groom and, uh, Donna's gonna go with bride.
Well, your mom and I have made some plans too.
We figure since we're already giving you a graduation party why not make it a wedding party too?
Wait, graduation?
- That's in a week, which is like- - Seven days.
- I know how long a week is.
- I know you know.
Well, what's the matter?
You two lovebirds still wanna get married, don't you?
I mean, heck, it'd be a real shame if you chickened out.
Then you'd be a couple of love chickens.
No.
No, we wanna get married.
Right, Donna?
Of course.
I do.
Well, then it's settled.
We're having a wedding.
Oh, Donna, you can wear my wedding dress.
It's off-white, so nobody will whisper.
Okay.
What is going on with them anyway?
Eric, if you need any help dealing with Mom and Dad I'm here for you.
Yeah.
No, thanks.
Last time I trusted you, I wound up in the dryer with a pillowcase full of bees, so- I know, and I am so sorry.
I have been cruel to you, Eric.
You too, Donna, but it wasn't as obvious because I mostly said stuff behind your back.
Right back at ya.
I'm not just home for a visit.
I am here to correct the mistakes that I have made in the past.
Okay, but I'm sure whatever bastard children you've had have been adopted by now.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
Hey, Fez.
I'm here to get my license.
Oh, hello, Mitch.
I'm here to tell you that you will get nothing!
Okay, I know we had our problems in wood shop but for the hundredth time, I'm sorry I sat on your spice rack.
You're sorry?
You should see my kitchen.
There's spices everywhere.
It's anarchy.
Dude, you're getting hysterical like a woman.
Well, if you mean that I am artistic and sensitive and cry every time that I watch Love Story, then, yes, I am like a woman.
Now begone!
You know, I could make it worth your while if you would just give me the license.
I'm the editor of the school paper.
Can you imagine this headline?
"Foreign Kid Actually Cool".
'Course, I'd have to retract it the next day, because-Well, come on.
Here's a headline for you: "Short Kid Takes Long Walk".
Well, hello, Hyde.
I saw something very interesting in the hotel this morning.
Oh, the guy in the dress?
That's Frank.
Comes in twice a month.
Gets really pissed if you don't call him Lady Laguna.
No.
I saw you kissing a girl that wasn'tJackie.
- Oh, that.
- Ah, so you admit it.
- Sure.
- Don't try to deny it.
- I won't.
- You're not gonna wiggle your way outta this one!
I'm not trying to.
Look, I cheated on Jackie, 'cause she cheated on me with you.
Which reminds me, I oughta kick your ass.
Well, Hyde, we weren't doing anything.
I already told you.
Jackie was comforting me, 'cause I was upset, 'cause Fez had a sex dream about me.
Would you shut up about that lame-ass story?
Well, it's the truth, and I'll prove it.
Let's go ask Fez.
- Fine.
- You drive.
My van's in the shop.
- Fine.
I need gas though.
- Fine.
Can I borrow money for fries?
- No.
- Fine.
Shotgun.
- There's only two of us, you moron.
- Fine!
You know what I think, Donna?
I think this whole "get married in a week" stuff is just Red trying to get us to call the whole thing off.
Yeah.
But you know what?
That ain't happening, missy.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna teach Red a lesson and get married out of spite.
Yeah, screw you, Red!
Wow.
It's every little girl's dream to get married out of spite.
You know what?
I think maybe you're not ready to get married.
And if you're not, you better tell me right now.
Donna, I'm not ready.
- Oh, thank God.
Me neither.
- What?
- I thought you were ready.
- I thought you were.
- I'm not.
- Me neither.
- Oh, my God, you are so hot.
- You are!
Wow, nothing hits the spot after an hour and a half of passion like chili cheese fries.
Oh, hello, Mitch.
Had a nice walk over here?
Get used to it because you'll never get a license.
- Do you understand me?
- No, but nobody understands you.
You talk like Mushmouth from Fat Albert.
You just dug your own grave, fella.
"I flug my own rave, bella"?
Was that what you said, Mushmouth?
All right, Fez.
I need you to tell Hyde about the dream you had about me.
What?
I didn't have any dream.
We have a visitor.
Fez, this is really important, okay?
Start talking, or so help me, I'll give you the worst purple nurple you've ever had.
Okay.
In my dream, Kelso was dressed as a nurse and he was giving me a sponge bath.
And?
I was nude.
See?
I was really freaked out and Jackie and me were just talkin', that's all.
So I just cheated on Jackie for nothing?
It's what I've been telling you, man.
Oh, Steven, look, okay?
Whatever you think happened between me and Michael, did not happen, okay?
So, everything's fine.
Actually, we need to talk.
You know, I really hate to run but I gotta go tell the whole school about you and Nurse Ding-a-ling's sponge bath.
So, I gotta go.
- You wouldn't.
- "Blue blound't"?
Move your lips, Mushmouth!
So, I was in the den, and Michael came over all upset.
- Jackie.
- And, Steven, I asked him to leave.
- And that's when you saw us.
But I swear, nothing happened.
- Jackie.
Jackie!
Stop talking.
Look, I know all this now, okay?
But before I knew, I was at the hotel last night.
And I was really mad.
There was this nurse.
- And- - And what?
And I'm really sorry, okay?
I promise it'll never happen again.
You know, that's exactly what Michael used to say.
- Come on, Jackie.
- No.
You know what, Steven?
I'm sorry.
It's over.
Huh.
- I finally get country music.
- ##  Donna, look, it's my old wedding dress.
Oh, and you can wear it as a bib.
Hey, and for the reception, I got the guys back together from my high school band- the Pinciotti Polka Explosion.
Won't be long now until you two lovebirds are married forever.
No escape.
Until one of you is dead.
So, you guys, I've been trying to think of ways to help you.
Okay.
Where's Laurie?
Yeah, what happened to you?
You guys, living in Chicago opened my eyes.
I had no job, no friends.
I did sleep with one of the White Sox but then it just turned out to be this frat guy wearing a White Sox hat.
Basically, I hit rock bottom.
Really.
God, I was so sure you'd be a senator.
Eric, love is hard to find.
And I've realized I've been taking the people who love me for granted.
Especially you.
Oh, that's not true.
I don't love you.
Yes, you do.
And if you two love each other, but Red is making you miserable then there's only one answer.
Get out.
Leave town.
Because love is precious.
Well, it sounds good but I can't help but remember the feeling of being stung by bees as I tumbled around and around.
Wait.
Is that a tear?
Oh, my God, Eric.
I think she's being sincere.
Oh, my God, it's real.
I have a sister.
Hey, look who I found.
At first I just thought he was a leprechaun.
Fez, I came over here because I wanna end this feud, okay?
Right here, right now.
And if you're not on board, I could spread your crazy naked, homoerotic dream all over school, but- Macho as I am who would believe you?
Okay, Fez.
Uh, can I just say as the nurse that was sponging you in your dream that I'm with Mitch here on the whole "not spreading it around the school" thing.
See, your lady friend here understands.
Truce?
Well I guess.
- Truce.
- Good.
Here.
Peace offering.
Moron!
Oh, this is tomorrow's school paper.
Oh, my God, on the front page there's a picture of me kissing Kelso by the lake.
Fez, why are you kissing Kelso by the lake?
We caught a fish!
I was excited!
I kissed the fish too, but, of course, they don't show you that.
Jackie.
Jackie.
It's Hyde.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Fine.
Can I say something?
I think this whole thing was a misunderstanding.
Hyde didn't know what was going on.
I know, okay?
But after Michael I promised myself that I would never be with another boy who cheated on me.
But Hyde's so good for you.
Since you started dating him you've completely stopped quoting Nancy Drew.
And the worst part is I still love him.
I know.
You know, normally, I wouldn't cry on your sweater because, you know, it ruins the fabric.
But, God, this one's just so cheap, it won't matter.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Just, you know, Jackie's single now.
- ##  Yeah, so?
So, when you were going out with her, I backed off.
You backed off?
You constantly hit on her.
You bought her presents all the time.
You shot me with a BB gun.
Yeah, that's me backin' off.
Look, Hyde.
I know you thought I only wanted her because you had her.
See, the thing is, is now you don't have her and I still want her.
So, as your friend, I'm just letting you know that I'm going after her.
And also, I'll be making out with her in front of you.
You know, just to rub it in.
So, be ready for that.
Whatever.
Yep, that's what I'm countin' on.
While I'm out getting Jackie back, you're gonna sit around here saying, "Whatever".
Are you listening to country music, man?
Whatever.
Look, Mom, Dad, Donna and I have something we wanna say.
Um, it turns out we're not ready to get married.
No!
And I was really rootin' for you two crazy kids.
Look, we know you've been pressuring us into marriage so we'd admit you were right and live on your terms.
But that's just not gonna happen.
So, we've decided to move away as soon as we graduate.
Move away?
No, no, no, you can't move away yet.
No, we were gonna use this summer to become best friends.
Look, we'll be going to college in the fall anyway.
Instead of fighting with you guys for the next three months we're just gonna get our own place in Madison.
Yeah, good luck trying to control us in Madison.
Hey, Donna, remember we agreed not to do that.
Remember?
Okay.
Anyway, we're gonna have our own apartment.
And, honestly, I just think we'll all be a lot happier.
- Madison has two movie theaters.
- Okay, Donna, come on.
Oh, great plan, Red.
Now my baby's leaving.
I'm still here, Mommy.
Yeah, well, that's nice.
- Hey.
-  The thing is, is I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, you said that already.
-  Come on, Jackie.
I made a mistake, okay?
It was a stupid one-time thing.
You know what, Steven?
I have heard it all before.
From you, from Michael.
God, just do me a favor and leave me alone.
Whatever.
Jackie.
I love you.
Yeah, well, I don't love you.
Here's your car license, motorcycle license boat license, license to operate a forklift a cut-the-line pass and a free D.M.V. Pen.
If you turn it over, the little car parallel parks.
Oh.
And here's the negatives of you and Kelso grabbing each other's asses.
Hey, we were happy because we caught a fish.
If they do it in football, why can't we do it in fishing?
"Blue bit bushball in bishing"?
What?
Where you from, man?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Okay, Eric.
Get a good look at me in my uniform.
Because today- It's my last day wearing it.
What?
No.
No!
Ah!
We never got to do the trampoline thing.
Hey, I'm done with Catholic school.
And my dad fixed it so I can graduate at Point Place with you guys.
My best memories are under that skirt.
Hey, Mom?
Where's Daddy?
I need $20.
- For what?
- In an effort to clean up my act I'm buying my own drinks now.
Well, he's not home.
When Eric told him about his little plan to move away with Donna after graduation your father went fishing.
- What?
- No!
What the big deal?
You guys are really freakin' me out.
My dad only goes fishing when he's, like, super-pissed.
I think something about stabbing a worm over and over again with a hook is, like um, therapeutic for him.
Yeah.
He fished for three whole days when he found out about me and the mayor.
- What?
- Eric's moving away!
That's right.
And that's why your father's angry.
This is your way of acting grown up?
Grown-ups don't just leave the comfort of their parents' home to- to move to a new city and start a life?
Well, maybe not in the 1930s- '40s- God, you're so young.
Well, I think this is nuts.
Don't you just think this is nuts?
- The whole thing is just-just nuts!
-  Mom, I kinda think you're the one who's being- Oh, if you say I'm nuts, you're going right through that sliding door.
I don't enjoy telling you this but you just wait until your father gets home.
All right.
I did enjoy that.
This is all your fault.
Yeah.
Hey, Laurie, uh, quick impression: Who am I?
"Hey, Eric, why don't you tell Dad you're moving after graduation so he'll kill you and I can reclaim my rightful place as the chosen one"?
Eric, you don't understand.
This time I actually meant well.
That's what you said at the county fair after you locked me in the Porta-Potty with a goat.
- He was friendly.
- He was horny!
- Hey, Jackie.
-  - Michael, what do you want?
- I think the question is, what do you want?
And I'm pretty sure the answer is pink jelly beans.
Now, they used to be pink and white jelly beans, but I ate all the white ones 'cause I know you don't like things that taste white.
Okay.
Look.
Michael, just because Steven and I broke up does not mean I want you throwing yourself at me.
Whoa.
Jackie, this is the new and improved Michael.
Okay?
I'm not throwing anything at you except for happy thoughts and jelly beans.
Like, sex is, like, the furthest thing from my mind.
So-  It's really over between you two, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it is.
- So why do we still have clothes on?
- Oh, God.
Michael, get out!
Oh, Jackie, I'm talking about our emotional clothes.
Okay, look, I know I've made mistakes in the past, okay?
But I've changed, and I just want you to get to know the new me.
Yeah, the new you, huh?
What does the new you cheat with- every skank who throws her fat, furry butt at you?
Jackie, no one I ever cheated with had a fat, furry butt!
If anything, it was one or the other.
But look, all that is over, okay?
It's finito, the end-o.
- I don't believe you.
- Well, it's the truth.
Okay.
Fine.
Michael, whatever.
- Okay?
Let's just see how things go from here.
- Great.
Let's get naked.
- Oh!
Michael!
- No, like, friendly naked- like two girls in a sauna.
You are such a freak.
Okay, look, just-At least take a jelly bean?
Okay?
I bought 'em just for you.
Well, that was very sweet.
There you are.
Give me back my jelly beans, you son of a bitch!
##  ##   Okay, now cross and uncross your legs.
Um- Hmm- Hmm, okay, now make a face like- like, "Oops, did I do something bad"?
Okay, now-now crawl to me.
Good.
Good.
Now crawl away from me.
Ooh, sexy.
Come on, Donna.
Throw him a bone, huh?
There's only so much satisfaction the kid can get from the back of a panty hose package.
Yes, Donna.
I have a lot to do.
After this I have to get Lindsay Wolfe to sign my yearbook then show her that she's actually signed a pledge to do it with me three times.
Why three?
Well, because the first time I'll be nervous and then the second time I'll have to please her because I got nervous.
But then the third time- the third time is when I get funky.
- Jackie- - No, no.
Steven, I'm not here to see you.
Okay?
I'm just here to see Donna.
Look, I told you I'm sorry, and I made a mistake.
Can we just talk, please?
Talk about what?
You cheated on me.
Okay?
It's over.
I feel nothing.
Ooh, bitchy.
You know what?
Donna, I'll just see you next door.
-  - Ouch!
- Are you okay?
Fez!
Panties!
Panties!
-  - Ah.
The sacred senior prank where we vandalize the water tower.
I've been waiting for this moment since well, the last time we vandalized the water tower.
So, Hyde gaveJackie some jelly beans today.
- Who cares?
- Yeah, well, you should, because they were pink and that is the bean of love.
And I got her that particular bean because I never stopped loving her.
Yeah, well, you stopped long enough to cheat on her with Pam Macy, Laurie and Annette.
- Who else am I forgetting?
-  There were many others.
But you cheated on her with a nurse.
It was a misunderstanding that you caused.
- That's it.
Let's go.
- Oh, yeah?
I'm ready.
I hope you got that nurse's number.
You're gonna need it when I'm done.
Hey, stop it.
Stop it.
You two need to grow up and start painting genitals on the water tower.
- Fine.
I'll be over here.
- Fine.
I'll be over here.
Well, since I have never seen another man's genitals, I'll have to paint my own.
In that case, I'll need more paint.
And a bigger tower.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
- Kelso, what are you writing?
- "Michael plus Jackie".
- I'm kickin' your ass!
Ah, you can't kick my ass from down there.
All you can do is punch my ass.
- Hey, get down!
- Just face the fact, Hyde.
You're down there and I'm up here, and I am invincible.
-  - Kelso, are you okay?
I think I fell!
- I'm gonna go check on him.
- Okay.
Okay, I think he'll be fine.
Now, let's see.
Where do I begin?
I want it to look like it's coming right at me.
This is the Point Place Police Department.
You're under arrest!
Um, I am a painter from a foreign country and this is my gift to America.
Get off the water tower!
People of America I give you Genitals in the Sky.
-  - You hear that?
-  - Sounded like your dad's car.
-  - Run for it.
No, you don't.
You made your bed.
Now you have to lie in it.
Oh, who am I kidding?
You never make your bed.
Eric, wait.
Listen.
If you leave now, you'll never get back in.
- That means good-bye to your clothes, your furniture- -  My G.I. Joes.
We stay.
Everybody in the living room.
You're gonna get it.
You're gonna get it.
Lay it on him, Red.
While I was fishing, I had a lotta time to think.
- That's right.
- And all that thinking made me very angry.
Very angry.
And the fish that were unlucky enough to cross my path- Well, you know how they say that fish can't feel pain?
That's a load of crap.
A big load.
And I finally came to a conclusion that someone in this room is not going to like.
That's you, porky mouth.
Eric - I'm proud of you.
- And that goes double for- What the hell did you say?
I did everything I could to stop you from getting married but you stuck to your guns.
And I admire that you're willing to go out on your own.
You're a man now, and you have my blessing.
This is like The Godfather.
I think you have to kiss his ring.
How can you just give in and let Eric leave home?
He has defied you over and over.
He's a- a lying, cheating, conniving liar and I won't let you send my precious baby boy away.
Kitty, my mind is made up.
And, Eric, we're gonna pay for your college too.
Really?
Dad, l-I don't know what to say to you, except you're great!
That's all right, Son.
We don't do that here.
Okay.
Well.
Well, this is nice.
Since we're all happy, Eric doesn't have to leave three months early.
He can go to school in the fall like everyone else.
We can take a pottery class!
No, Kitty, he's leaving: No pottery class, no mother-son dancing lessons no trying out for Family Feud.
But this deal is only good if you stay focused.
If you do something stupid- like get Donna pregnant- you're on your own.
Then I guess this is a bad time to give you the news.
I'm kidding!
I'm just so giddy!
- So it's just a sprain, huh?
- Yeah, it doesn't hurt too bad.
I guess the best part is I've now fallen off the water tower in every grade.
That record will stand until your son goes to school.
- Thanks for drivin' me to the hospital, man.
- Oh, whatever.
No.
Not "whatever".
I mean, look.
You drove me because we've been buds forever.
L- It's like, why are we fightin' over a girl, man?
Remember in third grade when we were both in love with Miss Hamill and we fought over her?
And then after you pulled my head out of the toilet, and I let go of your bean bags we made a pact to never fight over a girl again.
You know, you're right, man.
I mean, neither of us has a shot with Jackie anyway.
- So I'm steppin' back.
- No.
No, no.
You go for it.
I'll step back.
No, I'm serious.
Door's open for you.
No, I'm serious.
The door is open for you.
- I just closed the door for me!
- Well, I'm closin' the door for me and I'm lockin' myself inside, and I'm swallowin' the key!
Fine.
We're both done with her.
You're my bud.
You're my bud.
Aah!
I was wondering if that would work, and it did.
-  Steven!
Are you okay?
- Why?
Well, I heard someone fell off the water tower, and I thought it could be you.
L- - No, it was Kelso.
-  Wait.
You came down here, 'cause you were worried about me.
No, I didn't.
'Cause you still care about me.
Uh-uh.
- So I still have a shot with you.
- No.
No, you don't.
I mean, okay.
I don't know.
Steven, stop staring at me, or I'll kick you.
Ah!
Jackie, hope you didn't come here to make love to me.
- No, Michael.
L- - 'Cause I'm fine.
All I need is my buddy Hyde.
And no chick is gonna come between us anymore.
- Right, Hyde?
- Uh-h-h, yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go, buddy Hyde.
Aah!
Look at all the apartments they have in Madison.
- This place even pays utilities.
- Oh, cool.
What are utilities?
- I think it's, like, gas and water.
- Free water?
Um, you know what that means?
Free ice.
What are you two doing?
Oh, we're lookin' for apartments in Madison.
I can't believe it.
It's like we leave in less than a week.
Are you trying to kill me?
Because that's what you're doing.
You're killing your mother.
You only get one, ya know.
Eric, this place has a washer and dryer.
Wait.
A washer and free water?
- Oh, my God, it's like there's no reason to ever come home.
- I know.
Excuse me.
Washer and dryer, Red.
They are going to have a washer and dryer.
That redheaded harlot is gonna be Shouting out my baby's grass stains!
What about my last summer with my youngest child?
I bet you weren't thinkin' about that when you went fishing.
I bought sparklers for the Fourth ofJuly.
He loves sparklers and now he's leaving, and what are we gonna do for the Fourth ofJuly?
Uh-h-h, there's a car show in Kenosha.
A car show?
I don't want to go to a-  car show in-  Kenosha.
I want three more-  months with my baby boy and now they're gone because of your bull-  Way to go, dumb-ass!
Ah, it feels good to be back!
Just Kelso and Hyde.
No chick can come between us.
All right.
So what do ya wanna do?
We can play air hockey, give Fez a wedgie, uh- Oh, my brother just got a new stereo.
We can throw it off an overpass.
Actually, I changed my mind.
I'm gonna getJackie back.
What?
No way.
What about our third-grade pact?
We also made a pact to invent a formula for invisibility.
- Well, that fell through too.
- Well, because you gave up.
Look, Kelso.
I never felt this way about a girl before, okay?
And that pretty much beats our third-grade pact.
I'm sorry, but I wanna be with her.
Well, at the hospital, you said that I could have her.
That was when I didn't think I still had a shot with her.
Your- For your information, I still have a shot with her.
She accepted my jelly beans.
I don't know what that means, but you can't have her.
You closed the door.
Yeah?
Well, now I'm closin' the door on you, and once again, I'm swallowin' the key.
And you're locked inside, and I'm gettin'Jackie back.
Well, you're gonna lose.
Heh-heh.
Yeah?
Well, if by "lose" you mean "win," then you're right.
I am gonna lose.
Well, thanks a lot for getting me at the police station, you two sons of two bitches!
Fez, what happened?
Well, I got arrested.
And they did a background check and found out that my student visa expires when I graduate from high school.
- What?
- Yeah, and now I have to leave the country after graduation.
That's in a week.
And I have to relearn my native language.
- Good day.
- No, but Fez-  Way to go.
If you hadn't fallen off the water tower, we could've helped him out.
Aah!
Aa-aa-aah!
They should've x-rayed your head at the hospital.
They did.
And for your information, they found nothing.
Hmm.
I can't believe our little Fez is gonna be deported.
God, I wish there was something we could do.
Maybe I could talk to the mayor.
He owes me one.
Eric, we can't let this happen.
If Fez goes back to his country with those pictures he took my panties are gonna end up on a stamp.
Pop-Tarts?
Where's Mom?
She went fishin'.
Shut up and eat.
Dear PresidentJimmy Carter.
The following is a list of reasons why I, Fez, should be allowed to stay in your great country.
Number one: I have never gone number one on your beautiful soil.
Number two: I have never gone number two on your- Wait.
Scratch that.
Number two: "Fez" is also a word for a hat.
Uncle Sam wears a hat.
Coincidence?
Yes.
Three, where else am I going to live?
France?
France.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Ah, my last American Popsicle washed down by my last American grape soda.
Fez, it's sad you're getting deported but this "last American" crap's getting annoying.
Ah, my last American chance to annoy you.
Hey.
Come on, Fez.
Look on the bright side.
I mean, we graduate tomorrow.
You go to your country with a high school diploma they'll probably make you, like, head medicine man or something.
Eric, there is no bright side about going back to a place where people are outnumbered by lizards.
I'm gonna miss you, man.
When you get there, can you mail me a lizard?
- Eric, guess what came for you?
- Hey.
They just send those to me.
I don't even find those girls attractive.
No, you perv.
It's the key to our new apartment in Madison.
- Oh.
- Now we can leave tomorrow after graduation like we wanted.
Great.
By this time next week, our new neighbors will be hearing your cries of love through our paper-thin walls.
Cries of love?
Or cries of disappointment?
Oh, I don't want to go.
Come on, Fez.
It's not like we're never gonna see you again.
I'm sure in a couple months you'll be, like on the cover of National Geographic.
Yeah, those bastards are always so intrusive.
Fez, look.
At least we're going camping tonight.
- We'll all be together for our last blowout.
- It won't be all of us.
Kelso can't make it on account of he's got a broken face.
I don't got a broken face.
You will if you keep interfering with me getting Jackie back.
You're the one that's interfering.
You know what?
I'm going and Jackie's going, and you're staying home.
- No.
You are.
- No.
You are.
- Fine, stay home then.
- I will.
Hey, stop it.
Would you please put aside your differences and go camping with me?
We only have a few hours left together.
- Fine.
I'll go for you.
- Good.
Now, I am off to spend the rest of my American money on candy and porno.
- But, Fez- - I said, candy and porno.
Hey, Jackie?
You're gonna love these cookies on the camping trip.
They're sweet and tasty, just like me.
Kelso, this apple's kind of like you too.
You mean juicy and delicious?
- No.
Red and bruised.
- Agh!
Yeah?
Well, these hot dogs are like you, too, Hyde.
They're, uh- - Kosher.
- Yeah, kosher!
- Wait, what's kosher?
- That means blessed by a rabbi.
Burn!
Jackie, are you sure you want to go camping?
These idiots are gonna be competing over you the whole time.
Well, I am glad, Donna.
They've both jerked me around so much I cannot wait to watch 'em fight over me.
You know, if you really want to mess with them, you should do it with me.
Hey, talk about humiliating.
So, you guys are going to the lake, huh?
It is real fun up there.
My senior year, I set the record for most topless rides on the rope swing.
I wish I was goin'.
Yeah, don't even think about it, Laurie.
There are enough scary things in the woods already.
Eric, I'm being deported, and she's loose with the boobs.
She goes.
Hey, Forman.
Your mom just came back from the loony doctor.
She got real depressed when she heard you guys were moving to Madison, huh?
Yeah, you're tellin' me.
Last night she was making sounds that were giving my dad war flashbacks.
What a beautiful day.
I feel- I feel like a rainbow.
Anyone else feel like a rainbow?
- What happened to her?
-    I wrote that just for you, Jackie.
He didn't write that.
He ripped it off from "American Pie".
Nah-uh.
The "American Pie" guy ripped me off.
- You shut up, man.
- You shut up!
Okay.
I'm gonna freak everyone out and tell my ghost story so go hide in the woods and jump out when I get to the end.
You are as wicked as you are gorgeous.
You know, it really creeps me out being up here after what happened to those kids.
What kids?
A bunch of kids just like us were camping out up here and they disappeared.
And all the police could find were these bloody drag marks that led down to the lake.
It was like- It was like something killed them and then pulled them in.
Maybe it was the Loch Ness Monster.
No.
Fez, the Loch Ness Monster's in Africa.
So the police, like, searched the lake with their sonar and stuff and when they played back the tapes all they could hear in the background was, like, a whisper.
What did it say?
"I am the Lady of the Lake.
I am the Lady of the Lake.
" Yeah.
And you'll know when she's coming, because she screams before she kills.
Let's see if we can hear her.
I said, let's see if we can hear her.
D- Donna, I'm stuck in a thornbush.
I heard her.
She's stuck in a thornbush.
I'm kind of cold.
I'll reward who ever gets more firewood by letting them feed me marshmallows.
I'm not gonna go running around the woods trying to impress you.
I will.
Damn it.
I'm gonna go take a walk down to the lake.
She's going to the lake, old boy.
That means topless rope-swinging.
Now, do you want to spend your last hours in America eating s'mores?
Or watching her glorious breasts swinging in the chilly night air?
I choose boobs.
This is so strange, you know?
It's, like, our last night all together.
It's too weird to think about.
Let's, like, do something to get our minds off it.
Well, here's the tent.
So, I'll tell you what.
I'll go inside, strip down and just lay there- Let's go skinny-dipping.
Meet me down by the lake in five minutes.
Wait, so- I have to walk all the way down to the lake by myself?
Yeah.
That's cool.
Here you go, Kitty.
Home sweet home.
I went into my closet to get a jacket.
I found Kitty standin' in there.
I like the way the coats felt on my arms.
Oh, yes.
Why, there you are, my little sex muffin.
- Little brother?
-    What the hell was that?
It's the Lady of the Lake!
She screams and then she kills!
There's Laurie.
Okay.
Time to turn on the charm.
Hey, Laurie, are you naked, or you just happy to see me?
- Oh, my God!
Fez!
- Oh, my God!
Donna!
Steady, old boy.
Say something smooth.
Nice honkers.
- Get out of here!
- Hey, you like the rough stuff, eh?
It was awful.
I saw Laurie, and everything just went blank.
And I just ran, Donna.
I just ran away.
And then I heard these high-pitched screams.
And it was me.
Yeah?
Well, I've got bigger problems.
Fez is a good artist.
He's gonna paint me onto a nudie poster and sell it to every gaucho in Argentina, or wherever the hell he's from.
Eric, I'm gonna be Ms. Nude Argentina.
You know, being here under the stars sitting in the grass makes me really glad I'm not poor.
Man, check out that fire, baby.
Yeah, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's turning a small fire into a big fire.
Man, that one guitar-shaped log is roarin'.
What the- Is that my guitar?
Yep.
It's got a nice, warm sound.
- Dead!
- Back off, man.
Jackie doesn't want you.
Yeah?
She still has feelings for me and you know it!
Okay, okay, okay.
Stop it!
This isn't fun for me anymore!
What?
What do you mean fun for you?
I didn't say that.
Yeah, you did.
All right.
What are you trying to do?
You're getting your kicks off of watching us jump through hoops over you.
No.
We didn't jump through hoops.
I'm good at that.
I would have won that.
All right.
I'm done with this crap, Jackie.
You choose right now.
Me or him.
Yeah, who's it gonna be?
- Wait.
What?
No.
L- - What's the matter?
You don't know?
No, I don't know.
Wow.
Drama.
I know.
For a second there I almost forgot about my sister's wet, naked ass.
Oh, God!
Yeah, where is Laurie?
And where's Fez?
That was incredible, huh?
It was okay.
Okay's good enough for me.
Wow.
Yeah, I don't know if it's the mountain air or the poison from that thornbush but I slept great.
Oh, my God.
It's almost 10:30.
We're late for graduation.
Wait, wait.
Guys?
Guys, where's the van?
I think it's obvious, Jackie.
The Lady of the Lake stole it.
- Why would a ghost need a van?
- What's she gonna do, hitch a ride?
Who's gonna pick up a ghost?
And you're telling me you can't decide between us?
Oh, my God.
Fez and Laurie.
- They probably took it to mess with us.
- Aw, man.
I'm gonna kill 'em.
Eric, if I'm right about the Lady of the Lake, and I think I am they might already be dead.
I can't believe those morons missed their own graduation.
My whole life I waited to hear the Pinciotti name called at graduation.
When they skipped from Olendorff to Stevens a little part of me died.
Come on.
Let's get you a hoagie.
Kitty.
We've got to have a little conversation about those pills you're taking.
These things?
I think they're working wonders.
You know, I didn't cry once when Eric got his diploma.
I just smiled and took his picture.
That wasn't Eric.
That was some skinny girl with a Dorothy Hamill haircut.
But it's not fair, Red.
You-You teach your children how to- how to walk, to-to use a fork to-to look both ways before crossing the street and then one day you realize all you're doing is teaching them how to leave.
We should never have potty-trained him.
Listen, Kitty.
We did the kid thing and it was great.
But now I'm looking forward to it just being the two of us again.
This is our time.
Let's enjoy it.
You're right, Red.
I don't need those.
Whenever I feel like I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown, I'll just come talk to you.
And I'll just give you one of these.
Wow.
What a great day.
Not only did we get to miss our own graduation but we got to ride home in the back of a pig truck.
Yeah, when we went around a corner one of those pigs almost went to third base on me.
You know what?
I need a shower.
Hang on.
You're not going anywhere.
- You haven't given us an answer yet.
- Yeah.
Who's it gonna be?
You know what?
I can't talk about love right now.
The bottom of my jeans have something brown on them.
- Where the hell have you been?
- I have waited 18 years for my graduation picture.
I want you all back here at 5:00 sharp in your caps and gowns, ready to say cheese.
Is that clear?
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Yes, Mom.
Hey?
What kind of a moron leaves the keys in the ignition?
When I put the keys in my pocket, it distracts from my natural bulge.
God!
You guys, I've been thinking about Steven and Michael all day and I don't know who to pick.
Face facts, Jackie.
There's only one good man in this town and, well, he's leaving.
Eric, this is really hard.
I mean, okay.
I know I love Steven because he's smart, and he's deep and when we have conversation he makes me think.
Which used to give me a headache, but now I really like.
- So, go with Hyde.
- Yeah, but Michael.
Oh, Michael is so beautiful.
And you spend a lot more time looking at someone than you do talking to them.
Again, go with Hyde.
No, but, Donna, you don't understand.
Look, I know in a lot of ways I need Steven.
But Michael needs me.
And it's nice to be needed.
You know what, Jackie?
In order to help you, and- well, just to speed this thing up- I, uh- I think you should just take everything and toss it aside and ask yourself, who do you love the most?
You're right.
You're right.
That's what I should do- - Because I'm- - No, no.
Not here.
Not here.
Yeah, that's-Yeah, just- More dishes?
I thought we already loaded these.
You had to bring the Millennium Falcon?
Son, here's 10 bucks for gas.
No way.
Thanks.
Well, I just want to make sure that you get out.
I mean, that you get, um, all the way there.
Hey, guys, I made a decision.
So who's it gonna be?
"Tall and hot" or "short and kosher"?
Would you shut the hell up and let her talk?
Okay, look.
I had to ask myself a really hard question.
Who do I love most?
And the answer was so obvious.
It was staring me in the face the whole time.
The person I love most is me.
I love me most.
You choose you?
Look, if I could run across the beach into my own arms, I would.
Wait, what- So where does that leave us?
I'll figure that out after I spend the summer by the pool.
I feel this would be a lot clearer when I'm much tanner.
What a bunch of crap, man.
You know, freakin' girls.
If it wasn't for the soft skin, the legs the eyes, the long fingernails, the butts and the boobs, I wouldn't even talk to 'em.
All right.
All right.
Picture time.
Everybody get in front of the car.
Hey, Forman, I got you a plant for your new apartment - but, um, I can't give it to you in front of your parents.
- Oh!
Okay, here we go.
One, two- - Guys, I have something to tell you.
- Just talk while you pose.
Kitty, be sure to get me in the background loadin' the last bunch of Eric's crap.
- Aw, man.
- Okay, here we go.
Smile.
Okay, tell them Laurie.
I married Fez so he could stay in the country!
You did what?
Don't worry, Daddy.
I don't love him.
I was just bored.
Yeah, but we will be sleeping together.
You- Ooh.
Ooh.
- Dad, are you all right?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm just, uh- My arm hurts.
Red.
Red, you're all clammy.
Red, I think you're having a heart attack.
- No.
Open your eyes.
He's having an arm attack.
- Michael- Michael, get a chair.
Laurie, call an ambulance.
Okay.
Hang in there, Dad.
- Kitty?
- Yes, Red?
If I don't make it kill the foreigner.
So, Red's gonna be okay, huh?
Yeah, he's doing better, but they're gonna be at the hospital for a while.
- Hey, you got the letter for your folks?
- Yes.
I told them I'm married, and I'm not coming home.
And that people have landed on the great white head.
Yeah, that'll get there.
