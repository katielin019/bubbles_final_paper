{START OF EPISODE 1}
Listen to yourself, Bob.
You follow her to work.
You eavesdrop on her calls.
You open her mail.
When you started doing these things, the relationship was over.
Thank you for your call.
Roz, we have time for one more.
Yes.
On line four, we have Russell from Kirkland.
Hello, Russell, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
'I've been feeling sort of, you know, depressed lately.
'My life's not going anywhere.
It's not that bad.
'Lt's just, same old apartment, same old job.
Sometimes ' We're at the end of our hour.
I'll cut to the chase by using myself as an example.
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.
My wife had left me, which was very painful.
Then she came back to me, which was excruciating.
On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant and my social life consisted of hanging around a bar every night.
I was clinging to a life that wasn't working.
I knew I had to do something, anything.
So I ended the marriage and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle.
Go, Seahawks!
I took action, Russell, and you can too.
Move, change, do something.
If it's a mistake, do something else.
Will you do that, Russell?
Will you?
Russell?
I think we lost him.
No, we cut to the news Oh, for crying out loud!
I bare my soul to Seattle.
They're listening to Chopper Dave's Rush Hour Roundup!
The rest of the show was pretty good.
It was a good show, wasn't it?
Your brother called.
We call that "avoidance".
Don't change the subject.
Tell me what you think.
Did I ever tell you what this button does?
I am not a piece of Lalique.
I can handle criticism.
How was I today?
You dropped two commercials, left a total of 28 seconds of dead air, scrambled the call letters, spilt yoghurt on the control board, and you kept referring to Jerry, with the identity crisis, as "Jeff".
You say my brother called?
So I said to the gardener, "Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden.
"If I want to rake gravel every ten minutes for inner harmony, "I'll move to Yokohama".
This offends him, so he starts pulling up Maris' prized camellias.
I couldn't stand for that.
I marched inside and locked the door until he cooled down.
Would you have handled it differently?
Sorry, Niles.
I didn't realise you'd stopped talking.
You haven't heard a word!
You're a shrink.
You know how it is when people go on about their mundane lives.
Touché.
And on that subject, I heard your show today.
- And?
- You know my view of pop psychiatry.
And everything.
When was the last time you had an unexpressed thought?
I'm having one now.
- You guys ready?
- Two cafelatte supremos.
No, thank you.
So, Frasier, how are you doing on your own?
I'm fine.
I love my new life.
I love the solitude.
I miss Frederick, of course.
He's playing goalie on the pee-wee soccer team.
Chip off the old block.
- You hated sports.
- So does he!
The fresh air's good for him.
Well, this has been fun.
- There's a problem we should discuss.
- Is it Dad?
One of his old police buddies called.
He went to see him and found him on the bathroom floor.
- Oh, my God!
- He's fine.
- Is it his hip again?
- I don't think he can live alone now.
What can we do?
This won't be anyone's favourite solution, but I took the liberty of checking out a few convalescent homes for him.
A home?
He's still a young man.
You can't take care of him.
You're getting your new life together.
We were never simpatico.
Of course, I can't take care of him.
Oh, yes, of course.
Why?
- Dad doesn't get along with Maris.
- Who does?
I thought you liked my Maris.
I do.
I like her from a distance.
You know, the way you like the sun.
Maris is like the sun, except without the warmth.
Well, then, we're agreed about what to do with Dad.
"Golden Acres.
We care so you don't have to".
- It says that?
- It might as well.
OK, I'll make up the spare bedroom.
- You're a good son, Frasier.
- Oh, God, I am, aren't I?
Two cafe supremos.
Anything to eat?
No, I seem to have lost my appetite.
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.
- Hi!
- We finally made it.
Dad, welcome to your new home.
Gee, you look great.
Don't BS me.
I do not look great.
I spent Monday on the bathroom floor.
You can still see the tile marks on my face.
Gives you some idea about the ride over here.
Here we are.
Rest assured.
The refrigerator is stocked with your favourite beer.
We've got hot links and coleslaw and I rented a Charles Bronson movie.
Cut the speech.
We all know why I'm here.
I can't be alone without falling on my ass and you're stuck with me.
No, no!
We have a chance to get reacquainted.
That implies we were acquainted at one point.
Why don't I take Dad's things into his new bachelor quarters so you scoundrels can plan some high jinks?
That wife of his is driving him nutso.
Yes, we Crane boys sure know how to marry.
Let me get you a beer, Dad.
What do you think of what I've done with the place?
Every item was carefully selected.
This lamp by Corbu, chair by Eames.
This couch is a replica of the one Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier.
- Nothing matches.
- It's a style of decorating.
It's eclectic.
If you've got really fine pieces of furniture, it doesn't matter if they match.
They will go together.
It's your money.
Hey, that's the Space Needle there.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Being born and raised here, I never woulda known.
- Delivery for Martin Crane.
- In here.
Excuse me!
Wait a minute!
- Where do you want it?
- Where's the TV?
- In that credenza.
- Point it at that.
- What about this chair?
- I'll move it.
Careful!
That's a Wassily!
Dad, I'm sure this piece is dear to you, but I don't think it goes with anything here.
I know.
It's eclectic.
Niles, will you help me out here?
I need an extension cord to plug in the vibrating part.
Yes, that will be the crowning touch.
Now you're settled in, I've got to run.
I'm late for my dysfunctional family seminar.
Dad, have you mentioned Eddie yet?
- Eddie?
- Ta-ta.
- No, not Eddie!
- He's my best friend.
Get me my beer.
He's weird.
He gives me the creeps.
All he does is stare at me.
It's your imagination.
No, I'm sorry.
I'm putting my foot down.
Eddie is not moving in here.
Niles, sorry I'm late.
As I was leaving, Dad decided to cook lunch by the glow of a small kitchen fire.
This last week with Dad, it's been a living hell.
Either my territory's being violated or I worry about what he's up to.
I'm a nervous wreck.
I must calm down.
Double espresso, please.
You don't still have the brochures from those those rest homes, do you?
Of course I do.
Don't forget, Maris is five years older than I am.
You really think that's necessary?
Yes.
I don't have my life any more.
I gave up my tickets to the theatre, to the symphony What about the opera?
- Here.
- Thank you.
You don't suppose there's a chance that you and Maris could?
Maris and I were discussing this.
We should share the responsibility more.
- You mean you'd take him in?
- Dear God, no!
We'll help you pay for a home care worker.
Someone to cook, clean and help Dad with his physical therapy.
These angels exist?
I know an agency.
I'll ask them to send a few people over.
Niles, I can't thank you enough.
I feel this urge to hug you.
Remember what Mom always said.
"A handshake is as good as a hug".
Wise woman.
I have never been more impressed with a human being in my life.
- What was wrong with that one?
- She was casing the joint.
Casing the joint!
She spent two years with Mother Teresa.
If I were Mother Teresa, I'd check my jewellery box.
This is the last one.
Try to keep an open mind.
Hello.
Caught with me hand in the biscuit tin!
- I'm Daphne.
Daphne Moon.
- Frasier Crane.
Please come in.
My father, Martin Crane.
Dad, this is Daphne Moon.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, and who might this be?
That is Eddie.
- I call him Eddie Spaghetti.
- He likes pasta?
No, he has worms.
- Have a seat, Miss Moon.
- Daphne.
Thank you.
Will you look at that?
What a comfy chair.
I always say, "Start with a good piece, and replace the rest when you can afford it".
Perhaps you should start by telling us about yourself.
- I'm from Manchester, England.
- Really?
Did you hear that, Dad?
I'm three feet away.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I've only been in the US for a few months, but I have an extensive background in home care and physical therapy, as you can see from my résumé.
You were a policeman, weren't you?
- Yeah.
How'd you know?
- I must confess I'm a bit psychic.
It's nothing big.
Just little things I sense about people.
It's not like I could pick the lottery.
If I could, I wouldn't be talking to the likes of you two now, would I?
Yes.
Perhaps I should describe your duties.
Wait.
I'm getting something on you.
You're a florist.
- No, I'm a psychiatrist.
- Well, it comes and goes.
Usually it's strongest during my time of the month.
I guess I let a little secret out there.
It's safe with us.
We've learned all we need to know about you.
And a dash extra.
You're a dog, aren't you?
Well, we'll be calling you, Miss Moon.
- You got the job.
- Wonderful!
Aren't you forgetting something?
Shouldn't we talk about this in private?
Of course.
I completely understand.
I'll just pop into the loo.
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.
Oh, I love America.
- Dad!
- You wanted me to pick one.
- She's a kook.
I don't like her.
- She'll only be here when you're not.
Then what's my problem?
Daphne!
- You've been retained.
- Oh, wonderful!
I had a premonition.
Quelle surprise.
I'll move my things in tomorrow.
There must be some misunderstanding.
This isn't a live-in position.
The lady at the agency She was wrong.
This is a part-time position.
It won't work out.
- Let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to discuss.
You should talk about this.
I'll just pop back in here and enjoy your African erotic art.
- I think it would be best if you leave.
- Oh, all right.
We'll contact you.
If not by telephone, then through the toaster.
- I'm not having her living here.
- Why not?
- There's no room for her!
- What about your study?
That's where I read, where I do my most profound thinking.
Use the can like the rest of the world.
You'll adjust.
I've done enough adjusting.
I'm in a new city, I've got a new job.
I'm separated from my little boy.
And now my father and his dog are living with me.
The whole idea of getting somebody in here was to help ease my burden, not to add to it.
- Eddie, we're a burden.
- You're twisting my words.
I meant burden in its most positive sense.
As in "Gee, what a lovely burden"?
- Something like that.
- It's not only you who got screwed.
Two years ago, some punk robbing a store put a bullet in my hip.
I traded in my golf clubs for one of these.
I had plans, too.
This may be a shock, but one of them wasn't living with you.
- I'm just trying to be the good son.
- Don't worry.
- After I'm gone, you can live guilt-free.
- You think this is about guilt?
- Isn't it?
- Of course it is!
But I took you in.
I wanted to do it because you're my father!
And how do you repay me?
With a snide comment about this or a smart little putdown about that.
I've done my best to make a home here for you.
Just once would it have killed you to say one lousy "thank you"?
Come on, Eddie, it's past your dinner time.
I'm going out.
They have got to move the bathroom closer to the studio!
We'll be back after these messages.
Can't I put that on tape?
What's eating you?
Sorry.
It's this thing with my father and this person he wants to hire.
I thought I'd started my life with a clean slate.
I had a picture of what it was going to be like and then I don't know.
Ever heard of Lupe Velez?
- Who?
- Lupe Velez.
A movie star in the '30s.
Her career hit the skids so she decided to make one final stab at immortality.
She figured she'd at least be remembered for the way she died.
All Lupe wanted was to be remembered.
So she plans this lavish suicide.
Flowers, candles, silk sheet, white satin gown, full hair and make-up.
She takes the overdose of pills, lays on the bed and imagines how beautiful she'll look on tomorrow's front page.
Unfortunately, the pills don't set well with the enchilada combo plate she sadly chose as her last meal.
She trips in the bathroom, goes head-first into the toilet.
That's how they found her.
Is there a reason you're telling me this story?
Yes.
Even if things may not happen like we planned, they can work out anyway.
Remind me of how it worked for Lupe, last seen with her head in the toilet.
All she wanted was to be remembered.
Will you ever forget that story?
We're back.
Roz, who's our next caller?
We have Martin on line one.
He's having a problem with his son.
Hello, Martin.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
'I'm a first-time caller.
' Welcome to the show.
How can I help you?
'I moved in with my son, and it ain't working.
'There's a lot of tension between us.
' I can imagine.
Why do you think that's so?
'I guess I didn't see he had a whole new life planned for himself.
'I kind of got in the way.
' These things are a two-way street.
Perhaps your son wasn't sensitive in seeing how your life was changing.
'You've got that right!
I've been telling him that ever since I got there!
' I'm sure he appreciated your candour.
'Sometimes I oughta keep my trap shut.
' That's good advice for us all.
Anything else?
'I'm worried my son doesn't know that I appreciate what he's done for me.
' Why don't you tell him?
'You know how it is with fathers and sons.
'They have trouble saying that stuff.
' Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel.
- Is that all?
- 'Yeah.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
' - My pleasure, Martin.
- 'You hear that?
I said thank you!
' Yes, I heard.
Dr Crane?
Claire on line four is having a problem getting over a relationship.
Hello, Claire.
I'm listening.
'I'm, er  'Well, I'm a mess!
'Eight months ago my boyfriend and I broke up.
I just can't get over it.
'The pain isn't going away.
It's like I'm in mourning or something.
' Claire, you are in mourning.
But you're not mourning the loss of your boyfriend.
You're mourning the loss of what you thought your life was going to be.
Let it go.
Things don't always work out how you plan.
That's not necessarily bad.
Things have a way of working out anyway.
Have you ever heard of Lupe Velez?
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe # But I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Oh!
Good morning, Dr Crane.
Not a morning person, are we?
Never you mind - I am.
A good health care provider is up with the cock.
I've taken your father for his morning constitutional.
A remarkable man.
I see why you'd want him to live here.
Not many sons would do that, not without getting paid.
Coffee's made and I took the liberty of doing a shop.
They don't serve tripe in Seattle, do they?
And you are?
Daphne.
Daphne Moon.
I moved in yesterday.
You hired me to look after your father.
Sorry.
I'm not myself until I've shaved and showered.
I understand about one's morning ablutions.
I can't stand meself before I floss all that gunk out of me teeth.
Miss Moon Keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis.
Thank you.
Now my coffee.
The half-and-half's curdled and the garbage disposal's jammed.
- Good morning to you too.
- Morning was two hours ago.
And close that barn door.
We got a lady in the house now.
This isn't my coffee.
Where's my finely ground Kenya blend?
That's it.
Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it.
And didn't that just dress it up.
I like it.
Gives it a zing.
Now, sit down.
Breakfast is ready.
Dad, all I ever have is a bran muffin and a touch of yoghurt.
Girly food.
I fixed your breakfast.
I made eggs in a nest.
The Crane family specialty.
Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a hollowed-out piece of white bread.
I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak.
You want cheese on that?
No.
I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain.
Can't have my coffee.
Can't have my breakfast.
Oh, dear God, it wasn't a dream.
I'll get him for this.
And his little dog too.
Where's my paper?
Who stole my paper?
Mrs Everly, you old bat, I know it's you!
Yoo-hoo!
It's right here.
We brought it in for you.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Where's the rubber band?
This paper has been read.
Don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it.
That is not the point.
Dad, come and sit down, please.
You're going to give a speech, aren't you?
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You're psychic.
Yes.
But I think anyone could feel this one coming on.
Let us get something clear.
I'm not a morning person.
I have to ease into my day slowly.
First I have my coffee, sans eggshells or anything else one picks out of the garbage.
Then I have a low-fat, high-fibre breakfast.
Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper.
If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function.
My radio show suffers and, like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advice to help them in their lives.
I'm sorry if it sounds priggish, but I've grown comfortable with this part of myself.
It is the magic that is me.
Get used to it.
I know this is a stressful time.
It's new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly.
- Six more weeks of winter, I see.
- Oh, dear God!
Down, Eddie, down.
I said down.
Good boy, Eddie.
Just get down.
Good, good, Eddie.
Get down!
Dad, I can't read my paper.
Eddie's staring at me.
Well, you do make quite a picture in the morning.
- Ignore him.
- I'm trying to.
I'm talking to the dog.
Don't even think about it!
You're listening to Dr Frasier Crane.
Our topic today is intrusion, those who encroach on our sense of personal space.
The neighbour who plays his stereo too loud.
The person who sits next to you at the movies when there are 50 vacant seats.
Now let's return to our calls.
And let me remind you once more that our topic today is intrusion since so many of you seem to forget that!
Dr Crane, Leonard from Everett is on line two.
Hello, Leonard.
I'm listening.
'Hi, Dr Crane.
I'm a little nervous, but here goes.
'Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces.
'Lf I went to the mall I'd break out in a cold sweat and have to run home.
' Yes, Leonard, and your comments on intrusion?
'Nothing.
But now I'm afraid to go outside at all.
'I haven't seen another person in eight months.
' It sounds like you may have a serious condition known as agoraphobia.
But you're not alone.
'But I am alone, Dr Crane.
' Leonard, your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have.
Stay on the line.
We'll give you the name of a therapist.
That's all the time we have today.
You've been listening to Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.
Stay tuned for the news.
Then, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco and the Gonzo Sports Show.
I never miss it.
Yeah, right.
You want your messages?
Roz, hang on to them.
I'll stay here in here for a while.
I feel an overwhelming need for solitude.
I've got a fascinating book, comfortable chair and a soundproof booth.
- Hiya, Doc.
How they hanging?
- Bulldog, why are you here?
We lost power in Studio C. I have to do my show here.
Where the hell's my Cosell tape?
Someone stole my tape!
This is total BS!
Oh, here it is.
Let me get out of your way.
Doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasises about killing his parents.
You know what I'd have told him?
Sports.
You go out there, break some heads.
That'll turn him around.
If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racket.
Where's my Lasorda tape?
This is total!
Got it.
Hold on, I have to ask you something.
Gary?
I broke up with him three weeks ago.
The sex was OK, but he was kind of limited.
- Maybe - No.
He wasn't bad in bed.
He knew where all the parts were.
But most of them were his.
Yes, totally passionless.
It was like he was thinking of someone else.
I know I was.
Somebody's here.
I've got to go.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye, Mom.
- That was your mother?
- Yeah.
- You talk to your mother like that?
- We talk about everything.
- Isn't that healthy!
- You don't talk to your dad like that?
- Hardly.
We hardly speak at all.
- Really?
We're not really very similar people.
In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother.
If it wasn't biologically impossible, I'd swear Dad was left in a basket on our doorstep.
- Sweetcakes, you seen my engineer?
- Someone's talking to you, Frasier.
- Come on!
- He called.
He'll be right here.
Do you want to go across the street and have an expensive coffee drink?
Maybe some other time.
I'd like to continue my quest for solitude.
Go someplace where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me.
Maybe I'll sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park.
Hello.
Hello?
Dad?
Daphne?
Eddie?
Could it be?
# Toreador, don't spit on the floor # Use the cuspidor-a What do you think it's for-a?
#  So the elephant says, "He's with me".
Ah, Dr Crane, you're home.
We're back from your father's physical therapy.
Oh, glory be.
Oh, happy day.
Not that I'm not delighted to see you, but I'm in the middle of an exciting chapter.
I understand.
So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you a nice pot of tea?
- No, I've just poured a glass of wine.
- I see.
- What are you reading?
- You wouldn't find it interesting.
Any good?
I haven't formed an opinion yet.
Oddly enough, I'm having trouble getting into it.
Thick.
Dad Listen.
I don't want to offend.
But if you wouldn't mind, could you just let me read my book?
No problem.
- What are you doing?
- Leaving you alone.
- It's annoying!
- What's your problem?
- You've been like this all week.
- I can't get any peace in my own home!
Forgive me.
When I moved in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room.
- Perhaps only evenings.
- I heard that!
You're never out of earshot!
You've always been like this.
You were a fussy kid and it's got worse.
You and your precious morning routine.
You've got to have your coffee, got to have your quiet.
Aren't you a little hothouse orchid?
Hey!
I don't have to sit here and listen to that!
Why don't you go and live in a bubble?
Right now it sounds very inviting.
Finally a little peace and quiet around here.
Hello, Frasier.
Oh, what fresh hell is this?
That's a nice way to greet your brother.
Cafelatte, per piacere.
I'm sorry, Niles, I'm trying to read.
It seems no matter where I light, I get interrupted.
"The Holotropic Mind" by Stanislav Grof.
He concludes that changes in breathing induces alternate states of consciousness.
Now you've ruined the ending.
I'm sorry.
That was inconsiderate.
Mille grazie.
How's Father?
You mean the man who's driving me crazy.
The man who drove me out of my own home!
And how's work?
Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do.
Dad and I had another fight.
I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof we'll do irreparable harm to our relationship.
What are the alternatives?
If I didn't feel so guilty I'd do what I should have done in the first place - get Dad and Daphne their own apartment.
It hasn't been that long.
Give it a chance.
- Remember why you moved him in.
- Refresh me.
You wanted to get closer to Dad.
I still do, but he makes it impossible.
I can't read my book or have any peace in my own home.
So you want to be closer to Dad, but you don't actually want him around.
Ask yourself, have you tried to sit down talk to him?
I mean really talk to him?
Well, I Maybe I haven't done my best.
I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I?
Well Thanks for the chat, Niles.
You're a good brother and a credit to the psychiatric profession.
You're a good brother too.
Daphne, what are my things doing here?
My leather chair, my Tisami lamp.
We're putting them in the basement.
There was no room in your study with my furniture in.
- We discussed it last night.
- Of course.
I was going to ask that peculiar man from building services to help me.
Oh, yes.
Kyle.
Give him my regards.
Remind me again.
Which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?
The brown one.
Daphne left dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry.
Thanks, but I'm not.
Dad I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier.
Forget about it.
I already have.
There's been a lot of tension between us.
We never have a chance to sit and talk.
I thought we might have a conversation.
Right now?
I think now would be a good time.
Later would be better.
It shouldn't be a long conversation.
I'm talking three minutes of your life.
OK, but my programme's coming on.
If it will make you any happier I'll get the egg timer and I'll set it for three minutes.
So what do you want to talk about?
The idea is to have a normal, honest conversation without getting on each other's nerves.
Ready?
- Go.
- This is stupid.
One second?
That's our personal best?
Let us see if we can beat it.
Ready?
Go.
- How about those Seahawks?
- No sports.
- No opera.
- Agreed.
Ready?
Go.
This is your idea.
You say something first.
All right.
I'll tell you something about myself that you don't know.
Six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible that I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living.
Then I thought of Frederick.
And you didn't jump, huh?
Good, Dad.
Wow, I never knew that.
That's the point of this experiment, to tell each other something we don't know about each other, something vulnerable.
Your turn.
OK.
About two months ago I was going through old pictures of your mother and me.
All of a sudden, something flew up in my eye.
When I was trying to get it out, I realised that I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp.
- That's it?
You call that vulnerable?
- It hurt!
I'm not talking about that kind of pain.
I'm talking about your emotions, your soul.
A painful, gut-wrenching experience.
- Other than this one?
- Always a flip answer.
- This whole thing's stupid.
- Not to me.
How should I expect anything out of you?
You are the most cold, unapproachable, stubborn, cold man I've ever known.
- You said "cold" twice, Mr Egghead.
- Egghead!
Egghead!
- You said "egghead" twice too!
- You are infuriating!
Know what you are?
I'll tell you later.
I don't think you see how serious this is.
Will you give it a rest?
We're not getting along and it's not getting any better.
I'm not sure how to say this, but uh I I'm afraid I'm going to have to I know.
You want what's best for both of us.
You want to get me out of here.
We'll each have our own space and can put an end to all this bickering.
Well, yes.
I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all.
- Except for one thing.
I'm not going.
- What?
You want us to forge some great father-son relationship, That takes a couple of years, doesn't it?
You're the shrink.
- A couple of years?
- It'll go by before you know it.
Either that, or it'll seem like eternity.
I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.
- OK.
- How about us having a beer together?
Wow!
In all these years you've never asked me that.
I'd love to have a beer with you.
- Haul ass.
The store is about to close.
- Right.
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe # But I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again Good night!

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
In the Greater Seattle area, the number is 555-KACL.
Lines are open.
Please give us a call.
Who's up next, Roz?
Pam on line four has a family problem.
Hello, Pam.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
'Hi.
It's my in-laws.
'They drop over all the time without calling 'and expect us to stop and entertain them.
' They're your husband's parents.
What does he suggest?
'The other day he had us drop to the floor 'and stay quiet until they drove away.
' A creative approach, but hardly a long-term solution.
'I don't want to hurt their feelings.
' Either you risk hurting their feelings, or you spend the rest of your life diving for cover when they drop on by.
'Shh!
They're here!
' Your in-laws?
- 'Shh!
Yes.
' -  Then why don't you Oh, for Pete's sake!
Just tell them how you feel.
'I will.
Next time.
I promise.
Thanks.
' As Pam belly-crawls across her living room let's take a moment for this message from Carpet Fresh.
How's that for a segue?
It's not good to make rude gestures at other drivers.
He cut you off.
You should not antagonise a man whose bumper sticker says "If you're close enough to read this, I'll kill you".
Big talk from a Volvo.
- You found yourself a new suit.
- It's a beaut.
- Let's have a look.
- I'll model it for you.
Nice of you to buy your father a new suit.
It didn't work out the way I'd planned but What are you doing?
Fluffing your knickers.
If you don't mind my saying so, you're losing some of your elasticity.
I appreciate what you're doing, but a man's knickers are Ooh!
How do you get them so soft?
Fabric softener and twice in the fluff cycle.
Keep up the good work.
Hello?
Yes.
Oh, hi, Niles.
Of course you can come by.
Great.
I'll see you then.
Hi, Niles.
Thanks for calling first.
I heard your show today.
I wouldn't dream of popping by unannounced.
I was passing by and I've come to beg a favour.
My housekeeper Mary is a fan of your little radio programme.
What she lacks in taste, she makes up for in vigour.
She'd like an autographed photo.
It'd be my pleasure.
Daphne, this is my brother Niles.
- You're Daphne?
- Yes, I am.
When Frasier told me he'd hired an English woman, I pictured someone a little more not quite so You're Daphne?
Nice to meet you.
- Lovely accent.
Manchester?
- How did you know?
I'm quite the Anglophile.
I'm sure Frasier and Dad told you.
No.
I spent a year studying at Cambridge.
They didn't mention that either.
I guess they don't talk about me when I'm not around.
I wouldn't say that.
Niles, here's your picture.
Do you mind?
"Mary, here's wishing you good mental health.
Frasier Crane".
Fits like a glove.
Hi, Niles.
Hey, Dad Wow.
- How do I look?
- Wow.
Dr Crane took your father to Armani.
That's Armani?
I told you, Frasier.
He can't tell the difference.
We were on our way to Armani when Dad spotted this at a discount store.
It's sharkskin.
Look at the way it changes colour when I move my arm.
You'll be the handsomest gent at your friend's retirement party.
- Let's hang it up before it gets wrinkled.
- It's supposed to resist wrinkles.
They had one in the window wadded up inside a mayonnaise jar.
Frasier, is he our real father?
We've been having this discussion since we were children.
But that suit!
It's not just the suit.
It's his taste in everything - clothing, films, music.
Except our surname and strong calves we have nothing in common with him.
Thank goodness, we took after Mom.
Why didn't he acquire her sophistication?
He was too busy working so we could have the nicer things.
Maybe we should pay him back in some way, expose him to the finer things so that he'd stop lumbering through life like some great polyester dinosaur.
Dad's so set in his ways.
We all are at some point.
You thought the 1812 Overture was great classical music.
Was I ever that young?
You and I have to broaden Dad's horizons, show him the world that he's only read about in TV Guide.
- How about an evening of fine dining?
- Perfect.
But where?
Le Cigare Volant!
Can we get in?
I've been trying for months.
My name carries cachet in this town.
If the maitre d' happens to be a housewife, we're in.
Niles, you are so mean.
- I'll just call Information.
- No need.
I have it on speed dial.
Thank you.
Hello.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Yes.
The one on the radio.
Any chance of getting a table for four on Saturday, at, say, 8:00?
Merci.
A bientot!
We're in!
Niles, can I get you a beer, pork rinds?
No, thanks.
Dad, Niles and I and Maris would like you to join us for dinner on Saturday night at Le Cigare Volant, one of the hottest new restaurants.
I don't know.
The food is to die for.
Your country and your family are to die for.
Food is to eat.
Thanks, but I wouldn't like it.
How do you know?
I didn't have to get shot in the hip to know I wouldn't like that.
It's a chance to have an evening together as a family.
We really want to do this for you.
All right.
We're going to have the best time!
I can wear my new suit.
And won't that be nice?
How do the calls look today?
Jilted lovers, a man who's afraid of his car, a manic-depressive and the rest feel their lives are going nowhere.
I love a Monday.
How was your weekend?
I had my most hellacious date ever.
He asked me to pick him up from work.
I stop for gas and pump it myself while he reads the sports section.
We go to my place to make sweet and sour shrimp.
I ask him to hand me the honey and he gets this freaked out look and says he can't because he has a fear of touching anything sticky.
It was a new jar, but he wasn't taking risks.
- Where do you meet these people?
- I answered his ad.
- You got 30 seconds.
Get in there.
- Not yet.
Are you ready?
- Oh, no.
- We do this every Monday.
- You do this.
I play along.
- Come on.
- Who's got the best Seattle talk show?
- We do!
We do!
All right!
Well, aren't you a bobby-dazzler!
I'll go out on a limb and take that as a compliment.
- Where are you off to?
- Poker night.
You're a card player?
It's mostly social.
Me and the girls just bumping the gums.
No one ever loses more than $500 or $600.
Hi, Niles.
Where's Maris?
Are you taking separate elevators again?
Maris is having one of her episodes.
In the middle of dressing for the evening, she suddenly slumped down on the bed in her half-slip and sighed.
- I knew that dinner was not to be.
- Sorry.
I'll make the best of it.
Hi-ho, Daphne, you're looking luminous.
- Thank you.
- What's in the bag?
A little treat for Dad.
Some Devonshire clotted cream.
- For Dad?
- I love Devonshire clotted cream.
- Isn't that lucky?
You can share it.
- I'll pop it in the fridge.
- Sherry, Niles?
- Thank you.
I'm having a thought.
Since Maris has dropped out and we have an extra space, perhaps we should invite Daphne to join us.
It is a table for four, and three is such an awkward number, you know, at a at a dinner.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
For goodness' sake, I'm happily married.
Maris means the world to me.
The other day, I kissed her for no reason whatsoever.
I'm off to my poker game.
It was nice seeing you again, Dr Crane.
Wait a minute.
I'm getting something on you.
She's psychic.
We've decided to find it charming.
You have occasional bouts of colitis, don't you?
Yes.
Frasier, she's phenomenal!
It's a gift.
Well, cheerio.
Ta-ta.
You've never had colitis!
I know.
I couldn't bear to disappoint her.
OK.
I'm ready to go.
Dad, what's happened to your suit?
It's at the cleaners.
I got some creamed chicken on it at Phil's retirement dinner.
You can't keep anything nice.
I'm sure Le Cigare Volant has a dress code.
Niles, may I borrow your phone?
Thank you.
- Where's Maris?
- Episode.
Hello.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I have a reservation tonight and I'm calling to inquire about your minimum dress code.
Crane.
Frasier Doctor.
What do you mean?
They've lost our reservation.
Give me that.
This is Dr Niles Crane.
I've never been treated so shabbily.
I could come over and create a scene!
- They've already hung up.
- Thank God.
What now?
It's Saturday night, 7:45.
We won't get in anywhere.
Hey, I know!
Why don't I take us all to The Timber Mill?
- The Timber Mill?
- You get a steak this thick for $8.95!
It doesn't sound like the kind of restaurant we'd like.
- I was willing to go to your place.
- We'd better take a rain check.
I was looking forward to going out with you boys.
We'll do it some other time.
I'm sure Daphne's got something in the fridge I can heat up.
- I'm in the mood for a good steak.
- What?
The point isn't where we have dinner but that we have an evening together.
You won't be sorry.
They've got five toppings for your baked potato.
- Did you hear that, Niles?
- I'm sold.
We'll bring you a bone, Eddie.
He's ecstatic.
Quite a place, huh?
Used to be a sawmill.
Until somebody stated the obvious and said, "Hey, let's turn it into a restaurant"!
My mouth is watering.
There's nothing like the smell of charbroiled meat.
This aroma is triggering a sense memory.
Something familiar.
Oh, of course.
It's Maris and her home tanning bed.
Welcome to The Timber Mill.
Do you have a table for three?
Sure.
This way.
- Is this your first visit here?
- Yes.
We've got a dress code.
- His suit was at the cleaners.
- Not him.
You.
Timber!
- My tie!
She cut off my tie!
- Isn't that great?
- Why did she do that?
- They like to keep the place casual.
- You could have mentioned that to us.
- And spoil the fun?
Ah, cheer up.
- You get a free dessert.
- Oh, boy.
I guess you're right, Dad.
It's just a tie.
A Hugo Boss tie.
- Can I get you something from the bar?
- Oh, dear God, yes.
Stoli Gibson on the rocks with three pearl onions.
If you bring him two or four, he'll send it back.
- And for you?
- The same.
I'll have a Ballantine.
A funny thing happened the other day.
One of my patients had a Freudian slip.
He was with his wife and meant to say, "Pass the salt".
Instead he said, "You've ruined my life, you blood-sucking shrew".
I'll bet she didn't like that.
No, Dad.
She didn't.
How was your buddy's retirement party?
It was great.
I really miss those guys.
Bad news, though.
Mo Hanson, my old desk captain, was killed in a boating accident.
I'm sorry.
At least he went quick.
Hank Krinski, well, he had three bypasses before he went.
Jimmy Berman had this weird disease.
I visited him in the hospital.
When he died, his skin was all yellow.
Just wasted away to nothing.
Nice nurse, though.
Betty, I think her name was.
I see you're first-timers.
This is how it works.
Every entrée comes with soup or a trip to the salad bar.
One trip only, please.
Also included is our garlic cheese bread.
- Now you can claim your steaks.
- "Claim" them?
You get to pick the cut you want off the beef trolley.
How much extra would I have to pay to get one from the refrigerator?
Just pick your steak.
I'd like a petit fillet mignon very lean, but not so lean that it lacks flavour.
And I don't want it cooked, just lightly seared.
Pink in the middle.
Not true pink, but not a mauve.
Something in between, bearing in mind the slightest error either way, and it's ruined.
OK.
How about you?
Could I see the other side of that one?
Just bring us those three, medium rare, all the fixings.
Come on.
There's a lull at the salad bar.
They have the best Thousand Island dressing in town.
I saw the plaque by the cash register.
Here we go.
Three Paul Bunyans.
- We've barely touched our salads.
- Great service.
With luck, we'll complete our dining experience in 20 minutes.
- I could put this under the heat lamp.
- No, no.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
Let me know if I can get you anything else.
Thank you  I don't mind you being tough on this place, but you could be nicer to the waitress.
I'll apologise when she comes with the dessert.
Which should be any time now.
Sometimes there's nothing like a good steak.
I wish this was one of those times.
What's wrong?
- I don't mean to complain - Then don't.
These steaks come from prize beef What the hell are you doing?
Something's fallen in my potato.
- Those are bacon bits.
- I didn't ask for them.
- I ordered all the fixings.
- I don't eat bacon.
It has nitrates.
They're artificial.
They're made out of soy.
They really look out for your health here.
Everybody in this restaurant is enjoying the dinner.
Can't you do the same?
Niles?
Is Maris organising the Arts Council benefit again this year?
- Yes.
- Where are they holding it?
They haven't picked a spot yet.
Maybe I should tell them about this place.
- I'd like to be a fly on the wall that night.
- You wouldn't be the only one.
That's it.
I've had enough of you two jackasses.
I've listened to you making cracks about the food.
I've got news for you.
People like this place.
I like this place.
When you insult this restaurant, you insult me.
I thought you took after your mother, liking the ballet and all that.
But you mother liked a ball game too.
She'd even have a hot dog.
She had fancy taste, but she had too much class to make anyone feel second-rate.
If she saw how you've behaved tonight, she'd be ashamed.
I know I am.
- Dad, wait.
- I'm going to Duke's for a nightcap.
- Let us take you.
- I'll take a cab.
I've had enough of you.
Leave the waitress a good tip.
She deserves it.
- Niles, say something.
- Dad, wait.
The mud pie is coming!
The mud pie is coming  - I feel terrible.
- So do I. - The sad thing is, he's right about us.
- Are we really such snobs?
Do you see anyone else drive their father out into the street to drink?
- We've got to apologise to Dad.
- You're right.
Give him a couple of hours.
When he gets home, we'll settle this.
Absolutely.
We've been just horrid.
Do you think we've lost the ability to appreciate the simple things - steak, potatoes, fixings?
I'm afraid so.
The thing is, this is good food.
It's not fancy but it's good, wholesome American fare.
You know, as a tribute to Dad, we should sit here until we've cleaned our plates.
I'm game if you are.
We're going to prove we are not snobs.
Absolutely.
Frasier, look who's here.
Eat your food.
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Frasier has left the building.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
He's doing it again.
Must this dog stare at me all the time?
I don't know.
Eddie, must you?
He must.
What is so fascinating about me?
Is my head a large piece of kibble?
Am I some sort of canine enigma?
Think about it.
Get back to me.
Gents, dinner's up.
Can I help you clear your papers?
No, I need these in order.
What is it?
An old case from the police force, the weeping lotus murder.
You're still trotting this out?
He's been trying to solve this case for 20 years.
And I'm not stopping till I do.
Cops have an instinct.
Mine tells me this case can be cracked.
There must be one small thing I keep overlooking.
There is, who the murderer was.
It's nice you're still so dedicated.
It's a hobby.
Some guys build boats.
I figure out why a maniac kills a hooker and stuffs her into a bowling bag.
It's relaxing.
- Hello, Niles.
- Sorry I'm late.
Maris had a run-in with a rude Directory Assistance operator.
It shattered her calm.
Seems Maris is a bit high-strung.
Maybe she should see someone.
She's seen everyone.
Why do you think she was calling Directory Assistance?
Evening, Dr Crane.
Hello, Daphne.
Good to see you.
An enchanting scent you're wearing.
Must be the ranch dressing.
- Won't Mrs Crane be coming?
- I'm afraid not.
And no more of this "Dr and Mrs Crane" formality.
To you, it's Niles and uh - Maris.
- Yes, Maris.
- Glad you could join us, Niles.
- I wouldn't have missed it.
Well, the food's ready.
Let's start.
- Well, enjoy.
- Where are you going?
- In the kitchen.
- Don't be ridiculous.
You can't eat by yourself in the kitchen.
I'll join you.
We're all eating right here, like a family.
End of discussion.
Well, isn't this nice?
Feels just like home.
- I'm famished.
- Me too.
You boys still say a prayer before you eat?
- Oh, almost without exception.
- Yes, yes.
We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat.
You've blessed our table with Your bounty.
Thank You, Lord, for bringing this family together.
We also thank You for Your other gifts.
May we always remember to share with those less fortunate.
- Stop staring!
- I wasn't staring.
Amen.
Frasier, did you read Derek Mann's column?
You were mentioned.
- No.
- It wasn't flattering.
- Still, I'd like to have seen it.
- Why didn't you say so?
Who's Derek Mann?
He writes that "Mann About Town" column.
The things he says!
Sometimes, he's really funny.
What did he say?
"I hate Frasier Crane".
- Oh, sorry.
- That's it?
"I hate Frasier Crane"?
Don't let it bother you.
It doesn't.
I knew when I chose this career, I'd be open to criticism.
It's the price I pay for celebrity.
But thank you for bringing the paper.
And for highlighting it in yellow.
- Who'd like some wine?
- I would.
Daphne, the salad is exquisite.
- Why would he say that?
- Must be the carrots.
Not the salad.
Derek Mann.
Why would he write that?
This attack is totally unwarranted.
I'm a healer, for God's sake.
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- I've every right to be upset.
I won't enjoy my dinner until this is in the trash.
- I wanted to save an article.
- On what?
- Nothing.
- Come on, I'm interested.
Tell me.
It was about Margaret Thatcher's secret for growing zinnias.
Happy?
Not really.
OK, Lorraine, calm down and listen to what I say.
Will you do that?
- 'OK.
' - Good girl.
Your problem  'Oh, gosh.
That's call waiting.
Do you mind if I take it?
' Go ahead.
It's certainly an interesting situation she's in.
Don't you think so, Roz?
Yes.
'OK, I'm back.
' All right.
Listen carefully to what I say.
Your problem  'Sorry.
I'll be right back.
' For someone with so many problems, she certainly is popular.
'OK.
Go ahead, Dr Crane.
'  'I don't believe it, another call!
' Hold it, you want to take that call for the same reason you want to change your career and leave your boyfriend.
You're obsessed with what you think you're missing, the "call on the other line".
You've got to take one call at a time from now on.
Fully explore each one in turn, and you'll be a stronger person for it.
Do you follow me?
'OK, I'm back!
' Thank you for your call.
Only a few minutes left.
I'd like to end on a personal note.
As some of you may know, yesterday, I was mentioned in Derek Mann's column.
He said, and I quote, "I hate Frasier Crane".
"I HATE Frasier Crane".
What trenchant criticism  Move aside, Voltaire  Step back into the shadows, HL Mencken, there's a new kid in town.
One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef d'oeuvre, "I hate Frasier Crane".
A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well-thought out, point-by-point, constructive critique of this show.
But, no, not our Mr Mann.
So, dear listeners, when Mr Mann's column arrives on your doorstep, read it, enjoy it, and above all, treasure it.
For, one day this man will join the pantheon of the immortals.
And, if we're lucky, it'll be one day soon.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
- Funny running into you here.
- I'm always here.
- Have you seen today's 'Times'?
- No.
Lucky for you, I saved it.
Look at Derek Mann's column.
This is the second time in two days you've given me a paper.
Have you ever considered getting yourself a route?
- Hello.
I don't think we've met.
- We have, a few times, Roz Doyle.
Oh, of course.
It was at the, uh It was during the, uh Well, I'm too successful to feel awkward.
Where did we meet?
- The radio station.
- Nice to see you again.
Apparently, Mr Mann heard your programme.
So I see.
"Yesterday, Dr Frasier Crane got on my case "for not giving a point-by-point criticism of his radio show.
"Well, he asked for it" - His entire column is about your show.
- Not very flattering, either.
He even attacks your "dim-witted sidekick call screener".
That's me!
Oh, now I remember you.
"It's hard to say what to hate most about Crane's show, "his pompous, sanctimonious style, his self-congratulatory references, "or his voice, a mock sympathetic tone so sickly sweet, "one wonders if he graduated from medical school "or from some mind-controlling cult".
- It's continued on 12.
- I've read enough!
- Can I get you anything?
- How could he say something like that?
- It's my job.
I'm a waiter.
- We don't want anything, thank you.
In a few days, it'll blow over.
You're right.
To retaliate would be to stoop to his level.
The best response is no response at all.
Pompous and sanctimonious, am I?
Mann can't even write grammatical sentences.
Every five words there's one of his precious dot-dot-dots.
He must like making dots with the crayon he writes this drivel with!
Dr Crane, we have Stewart who has a problem with delayed gratification.
Well, he's just gonna have to wait!
I don't know who Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his paper like a school child behind a tree, I say, let's expose this Derek Mann for what he is, not a man at all, but half a man.
- What line is Stewart on?
- He hung up.
I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today.
Let's see who's on line five.
Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
- 'Good, 'cos I was listening, too.
' - And you are?
'Derek Mann.
' I see.
'Look, nobody calls me half a man, especially some lvy League twit.
'So what do you say we settle this like men?
' Are you implying you want to fight me?
'No, I'm saying it.
' Fight as in a fist fight?
'No, I thought we'd throw pies at each other  'So are you up to it, or aren't YOU man enough?
' We'll be back after these messages.
We're back.
We have a surprise caller, Derek Mann.
'What's it gonna be?
You gonna fight me or not?
' - You can't be serious.
- 'Just as I figured.
You're chicken.
' No, I don't think civilized people behave that way.
Maybe our listeners have an opinion.
Who's on the line?
Lines one to eight are people who think you're chicken.
- 'You're chicken, Crane.
Admit it.
' - I'm not chicken!
We are mature, thinking people, not cavemen.
You want a fight so bad, name the time and place.
'Kinsley Square, outside your office, by the old statue, noon tomorrow.
'Don't back out.
' I won't.
Don't you back out, either, because I know where your office is, too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you down!
Who else wants a piece of me?
Having a look at that murder case again?
Yeah, I dug out the old crime scene photos.
Don't be a greedy guts.
Let's have a look.
Her name was Helen.
Yeah, it was.
You must have seen that on some of my papers.
No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.
- You're putting me on.
- She had a lot of men in her life.
No kidding.
She was a hooker.
No, I mean she had four brothers.
That's amazing.
She did have four brothers.
What else are you getting?
Tell me more.
I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet.
Give it a try, please.
What else are you getting?
Nothing No, wait.
- I see a man.
- Yeah?
A well-dressed man.
He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat.
Yeah, yeah.
He's getting off an elevator.
He's walking down a long hallway.
She doesn't know he's coming.
He's opening the door.
Hello, everyone.
Sometimes I get me signals crossed.
- What's going on?
- Unless you killed a hooker, not much.
We heard your show.
I loved the way you handled that Derek Mann.
Especially when he challenged you to a fight and you stood up to him.
- Yes, I did, didn't I?
- Boy, I can't wait to see that.
I'm not actually gonna go through with it, Dad.
- What are you talking about?
- I already won our little war of words.
How would I benefit by having a fist fight?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding.
He challenged you, and you're backing down?
Mature people should use their intellect to settle differences.
A man doesn't just turn and run.
- Are you encouraging me to fight?
- You gave him your word.
I didn't know what I was saying.
I hadn't had lunch.
I might've known this would happen.
It's Billy Kriezel all over again.
What did you say?
Something about a Billy Kriezel.
That was 30 years ago.
- Who's Billy Kriezel?
- A kid who tormented me.
So Frasier made fun of Billy's crew cut.
He started it.
He made fun of the elbow patches on my blazer.
They were supposed to fight after school only "Patches" didn't show up.
I had a clarinet lesson!
You don't need to remind me.
Billy's dad was a cop, too.
The guys rode me about that for years.
Every time I couldn't make it for a drink, they'd say, "Got a clarinet lesson"?
Couldn't you have met Billy after the clarinet lesson?
Daphne, could you excuse us for a moment?
Of course.
I have a feeling I'm going to be excused a lot in this house.
I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kriezel 30 years ago.
The situation is not the same now.
I'm adult, I've been to med school, I have a position in this city.
- I don't resort to brawling.
- You accepted the man's challenge.
You won't be happy until I have a black eye.
I just want you to do what you said you'd do.
You can talk about your medical school, your intellect, your place in this city But you know what?
It's all one big clarinet lesson.
I can't even look at you.
So I step out of the shower, I look out the window, and I notice the garbage man looking at me.
I say, "Did you get a good look"?
He says, "No.
Turn around".
He smiles, and he's missing a tooth.
That's when the romance went out of it.
Why are you telling me this?
To get your mind off the fact that in five minutes you're going to get your clock cleaned.
Did it occur to you that I might win?
Your shoe's untied.
If you fell for that one, you're going down, and you're going down hard.
Frasier, there's quite a crowd out there.
Secretaries with bag lunches, children with balloons.
- All that's missing is a mariachi band.
- They're setting up.
I'd better go find a place in the crowd.
I'll be off to the left if you tear his ear off and want to throw it to me.
As your brother and as your friend, why are you doing this?
- It's Billy Kriezel.
- Where?
He's not here, Niles.
- I ran away from him when I was ten.
- I remember.
You know, and I've been running ever since.
Well, this is where it stops.
I'm not running any more.
What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?
Chalk it up to random violence.
- Hey, there.
- Dad, what are you doing here?
I said some things that went over the line.
Dad, if you're worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do, you're wrong.
I l'm doing this for myself.
Good.
Who told you that I was going through with it?
Let's just say a father knows certain things about his son.
Good news.
I parked on a broken meter.
We're getting a freebie.
Good luck with the fight.
Thank you, Daphne.
Any psychic predictions?
Actually, yes, but don't worry.
I'm frequently wrong.
Frasier, there's something I want you to see.
There, the man standing to the left of the statue.
I recognize him from the paper.
That's Derek Mann.
He's gigantic.
My God, you could show a movie on his back.
Sure you wanna go through with it?
- Yes Yes, I am.
- Good.
You'll be fine.
Remember, this is a street fight, so fight dirty and throw the first punch.
I find that a knee to the groin does the trick.
Any doubts, check with a fellow in Manchester named Nigel Tavers.
If we want an unobstructed view I prefer if you guys stay here.
Whatever you want.
- Well, wish me luck.
- Go, champ.
That a boy.
They got a band out there.
I have to get their card.
I need someone for our summer barbecue.
Look, they're starting to fight.
They're just sizing each other up.
Come on, Frasier, hit him first!
- Is that the police?
- What are they doing here?
They're breaking it up.
OK, I'm coming peacefully.
Let me get my jacket.
I'm not arresting you.
But I warn you, in this town, we don't settle our differences with street fights.
- You'll have no more trouble from me.
- OK.
Dad, did you see me?
My hands are trembling.
My chest is pounding, my knees are like jelly.
I feel great!
You did good.
I was out there.
I was ready.
You saw that, right?
- You would have kicked his butt.
- From here to Tacoma.
I say we celebrate.
A round of victory lattes on me.
Thanks, Harry.
I owe you one.
You cut it close, Frasier was almost eating sidewalk.
- I'm missing lunch for this.
- You could stand to miss a few.
Some of the guys are having a beer.
Why don't you come?
Maybe I will.
You know why I will?
'Cos the Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons any more.
What are you talking about?
Oh, that's right.
You weren't in my precinct.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused # Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with # Those tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hello, Doug, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
'Lt's about my mother.
She's getting on now and she hasn't much of a life.
'She doesn't want to do anything, go anywhere.
'She literally hangs around the house all day.
It is very frustrating.
' Can we go back for a second?
You said your mother "literally" hangs around the house.
It's my pet peeve: You mean she figuratively hangs around the house.
To literally hang around the house you'd have to be a bat or a spider monkey.
- 'Can I tell you my pet peeve?
' - Sure.
'I hate intellectuals with superiority complexes who nitpick your grammar 'when you ask for help.
That's what I've got a problem with.
' I think what he means is, "that is a thing, with which he has a problem".
It's time for a station break.
We'll be back after this message from "Pizza, Pizza, Pizza".
Wanna hear my pet peeve?
You're in a store, the clerk is helping you and the phone rings.
So he starts taking care of them.
You go, "I came here in person, while some joker at home "in his underwear is getting first-rate service".
Don't you hate that?
Actually, I do most of my shopping by phone.
This got me thinking about my father.
He doesn't do much, either.
He just sits around watching TV or doing the occasional crossword.
- What does your mother do?
- Wisconsin Attorney General.
- No, really?
- Really.
Oh I guess that helps fill her day.
She says, "Crime never stops, even in the dairy state".
I don't think public office is for Dad, but Maybe I can find him a hobby.
Any suggestions?
Mom likes to water-ski a little.
She hikes, oil paints Oh, she likes archaeology.
She's on a dig in Honduras right now.
Well, maybe I could get him a wood-burning set.
Is Dad still asleep?
Yes, with the dog.
Eddie's legs are going like mad.
He's dreaming of chasing rabbits.
But why is your father twitching?
Just about done with this thing.
Your dad will love it.
I was walking through the hobby shop.
It was "Eureka"!
I actually said, "Eureka"!
Ah, yes.
There are a million stories in the naked city.
Now, if we could just find a naked one.
Dr Crane!
You naughty boy!
Peeking in on other people's privacy!
If people were concerned about their privacy, would they leave their blinds open where you can see the mantel mirror that reflects to the waterbed?
Your father's coming.
Stand in front of it.
We'll make this a surprise.
- Hi, guys.
- How was your nap?
I had the strangest dream.
A woman with bad breath was licking my face.
Hey, where'd you just come from?
I got a surprise for you.
Hey, a telescope!
That's a beaut!
What's the occasion?
- I just thought you'd like it.
- That's great, thanks!
I saw on the news, there's a bunch of falcons on the Columbia Tower.
- I can watch them from here.
- Forget the falcons.
You can see everything in that building.
I'd lock people up for that.
It's innocent.
Just think of it as having like 100 more channels to watch.
Just look, people going about their lives.
There's an old couple watching telly.
Next door, an attractive young woman is working at a computer, while below her a burly man is sopping up a large pool of blood.
- Oh, God!
- What?
Oh, Daddy!
Nah, that's tomato juice, you can see the can.
- Yes, she is a looker!
- There's a voyeur in all of us.
Let's see what else the Seattle skyline has to offer.
I say we make a strict rule.
If anybody does anything nasty, we move on.
Agreed?
I said "agreed"?
Yeah.
There's a lady with a telescope looking back at us!
- What shall we do?
- Hide!
Every time I do something bad, I get caught!
Hi!
How you doing?
What are you doing?
- She's waving, I'm waving back.
- Don't do that.
Why not?
Wait, she's writing something!
She's holding it up.
It says, "Hello, there, stranger".
- Daphne, get me that pad and pen!
- What for?
I'll answer her.
Write down, "My name is Martin".
You shouldn't encourage her.
I don't want people looking in on us.
I don't think I made my bed today.
Is she writing anything else?
- Yeah"My name is Irene".
- Her name's Irene.
- Thank you.
- Wait, she's writing something else!
"Is that Dr Crane from the radio hiding there behind you"?
It does not say that!
Oh, it does say that!
Hello!
- Her oldest son is an accountant.
- He was the breech birth?
- No, that's the dentist in Boise.
- Oh, right.
He's got the wife that won't let him visit.
I can't stand her.
Morning, Dad, Daphne.
Morning, Irene.
When you were a kid, what was that skin condition you had on your butt?
Pityriasis rosea.
- How do you spell that?
- Why?
Irene and I are exchanging family histories.
- Don't tell your girlfriend about that.
- She's not my girlfriend!
You've been exchanging notes for the last three days.
If you were in the sixth grade, you'd be sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.
- Let me borrow that pad.
- What are you doing?
I'm going to help along your little romance and maybe save a small forest.
- I'm giving her our number.
- No, don't do that!
- Why?
- She'll think I'm being too forward.
You met peeping into her apartment.
She won't call.
- Want to bet?
- Yeah, five bucks.
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- You get it.
Dad, it's for you.
Hello?
No, no, this is Frasier, hi.
I'm fine.
It, uh gets a little flaky when the weather is dry.
- Tell her I'm not home!
- She knows you're home.
She can see you through the telescope.
- Come on, you're just a little nervous.
- Hello?
Hi Yeah, it's nice hearing yours.
Can you hold on a minute?
Would you two get out of here?
I'm getting a very good feeling about this.
- You really think he's interested in her?
- Yes, I think so.
Do you want to hear something cute?
I made him this rich coffee cake.
You know what a sweet tooth he has.
And he wouldn't even take one bite, because as he put it, "Women don't like a spare tyre on a man".
That's so cute.
Oh, it's funny.
The twists and turns of fate.
If I had tried to set Dad up with a woman, he would've refused.
But I go out, get him a telescope and it kindles this romance.
It's kismet.
- Well?
- What?
- What happened?
- We talked.
Was she nice, interesting?
What did she say?
- A lot of stuff.
- So, you'll be seeing each other?
- She wanted to, but I said no.
- Why?
She's not my type.
Oh, coffee cake!
We got any butter around here?
You know the pompous twit who's president of my wine club?
At the meeting, I convinced my fellow psychiatrists to play a prank on him.
Thinking he was tasting a Chateau Petrus, he was in fact sipping a Fourcas-Dupré.
- You see, we'd switched the labels.
- What scamps you are.
There he was, proclaiming the Petrus to be the superior wine, and none of us could contain our laughter.
His face must have turned redder than a Pichon-Longueville.
Of course, as so often happens, roughhouse turns to tears.
At the end of the evening, he tendered his resignation.
That must have ruined the evening.
- Not really, I'm the new president.
- Kudos, indeed.
Oh!
Are Dad and his lady friend still playing telescope footsie?
- What was her name?
- Irene.
No, they've broken it off.
Already?
I thought it was going well.
It was, then they spoke once and then Dad said she wasn't his type.
It's over.
He's cut her out of his life.
I just don't understand why he did that.
Who knows why anybody does anything?
Remind me again what you do for a living.
It was one phone call.
How can you make a judgment about someone from one phone call?
Remind me again what you do for a living.
I suppose it could be any number of reasons - fear of rejection, shyness Maybe she just wasn't his type.
If only we knew someone who was.
I know!
Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice is in town visiting from Washington DC.
Maybe we should set Dad up with her?
I've met Aunt Patrice.
She's a loon.
Do this for me.
When Aunt Patrice visits, Maris dives under the duvet with a two-week migraine, and I'm left holding the bag, literally and figuratively.
No, I don't think so.
I know Dad.
Don't meddle.
- At least say hello to Aunt Patrice.
- I'm not driving out there.
She's out in the car.
- You left her in the car?
- I cracked open a window.
Oh, then she's fine.
No, calm down, son.
Listen to Daddy.
It's just a bad dream, I promise you.
Senator Thurmond is not in your closet.
That's a good boy.
All right.
You go back to bed now I love you, too.
I'll see you next weekend.
OK, bye-bye.
- How's Freddy?
- He's fine.
He thanks you for the toy gun you gave him.
Or what he can remember of it before Lilith smashed it with a croquet mallet.
Oh, it's such a beautiful night.
The city is lit up like a jewel.
Oh, look, there's Irene!
She's sitting in her window wearing a stunning green dress.
But her face It's so sad!
Oh Oh, she's holding a note.
It says, "Martin, was it something I wrote"?
Will you cut it out.
Irene is not sitting in her window!
All right, but she might as well be.
- Ever met a woman who's not the one?
- Yes.
Five years after I married her.
Hello, there Frasier.
Niles!
I was specifically not expecting you.
You remember Aunt Patrice?
Of course, Aunt Patrice.
I don't recall when we met, but I remember a lot of laughing, dancing.
- My husband's funeral.
- Yes!
Of course!
Of course, the laughter was to hide our tears.
- Let me take your wrap.
- We were driving and I thought, "We're just a couple of short ferry rides from Frasier's".
So we decided to pop over.
Is this the charming gentleman you were talking about?
You bloodhound, you've treed another one.
Yes, this is my dad.
How are you, Patrice?
I'm Martin Crane, this is Daphne Moon.
- Nice to meet you.
- Please.
What brings you to Seattle?
I came to see Maris, but she's taken to her bed again.
I still have no idea how tall she is.
Patrice and I've had a great time.
If you call sitting in your waiting room reading old magazines a great time, then, yes, we had a laugh riot.
Now I know where Maris gets her sense of humour.
Why don't I pop in the kitchen and get us all some refreshments.
A capital idea.
We'll join you and give these kids time to get to know one another.
- I told you not to bring her here.
- I ran out of ways to entertain her.
We went to the arboretum, a fashion show, we even spat off the top of the Space Needle.
I'm sorry, I cracked.
That woman is not Dad's type.
You never know when love can bloom between two different people.
Daphne?
I never thought opposites attract.
Neither do I. We're alike.
- We can't leave Dad alone with her.
- I'm sure they're doing fine.
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g-speak'g?
- I was afraid of this.
- What?
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g-speak'g?
Niles, I think she's having a stroke or something.
No Dad, it's just g-speak.
- Come again?
- She trots it out at parties.
You just put a "g" in every syllable.
So, you would be M'gar'g'tin g'Crane.
Just say it with me.
Come on: M'gar'g'tin I don't think Dad's interested.
- Oh, b'ge a good sp'gort, N'giles.
- What?
- "Be a sport, Niles".
- B'ge a'g sp'gort, ta-dah!
Dad, you still have your billy club?
It's in my top drawer.
It's all the rage in Washington.
You know who speaks it all the time?
G'george Ste'g'pha'g'no'g'poul'g'os.
I got pizza rolls but the expiration date was yesterday.
Are we game?
That's not necessary, Daphne.
We don't want to spoil our appetites for that dinner in 20 minutes.
That's right, that dinner in 20 minutes!
I told you we shouldn't have just stopped by.
- These people have plans.
- How I envy them.
It was such a pleasure meeting you.
- Likewise.
- Oh, no.
You can do better than that!
Oh, I look forward to my next trip to Seattle!
If you're ever in Washington.
I'm in the b'gook.
What the hell was that?
- I feel sorry for the poor thing.
- I feel sorry for Niles.
That's who I'm talking about.
- You know I saw what you just did.
- What did I do?
When she went to hug you, you moved away.
- Wouldn't you?
- You moved away from the window.
You didn't want Irene to see you.
You care about her.
Go chase yourself.
You do.
Something is stopping you from having a relationship with her.
You won't let go of this thing!
- No, I won't.
- All right.
- Irene's middle name is Rose.
- So?
Rose is a nice name.
It was Mother's middle name.
- Yeah.
- Oh, Dad.
Look, you can't feel guilty about that.
Mom's been gone for six years now.
Your feelings for Irene are separate from those for Mom.
If Mom was here, - she'd want you to get on with your life.
- OK.
When I'm ready.
Thanks Frasier.
I guess I don't say it often enough but you're a good kid.
Thanks.
There's something I don't say often enough There's nothing you don't say often enough.
Right, Dad.
I couldn't help but overhear.
That was a very nice thing to say.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
Strangely, I could have sworn Irene's middle name was Marie.
- No.
- I can check.
I still have all our notes.
All right, I had to tell him something.
He just won't believe me when I tell him Irene isn't my type.
- You sure?
- You gonna get on my back, too?
No, but I was wondering if the reason why things didn't work out between you and Irene was well - What?
- Well, maybe if you weren't a bit self-conscious about your hip?
That's ridiculous.
I'm glad to hear that.
You don't have anything to be self-conscious about.
With that silvery mane, twinkling blue eyes and whisky voice, you're quite a package.
- Yeah, I'm quite a catch.
- You are.
And you know as well as I do, history is full of sexy limpers.
For instance, Franklin D Roosevelt.
Of course, he didn't limp so much as roll.
Toulouse-Lautrec.
Although he was a little person.
Still, he did well with the ladies.
Of course, they were all prostitutes.
But he was French - there's no explaining their taste.
- What's your point?
- I guess I don't have one.
It's just me.
But there is one little thing, every time you went to the telescope to see Irene, you hid your cane.
I just put it off to the side so I wouldn't trip over the damn thing.
I knew there was a good reason.
It must feel awful silly when that cane trips you up.
- Hurry up!
She'll be here any minute.
- All right.
Have I got this tie on right?
It needs a minor adjustment.
What's all this hair on it?
The only way I can get the knot right, is if I tie it on Eddie first.
Has dating changed much in the last 40 years?
Well, the wardrobe is a little different, but your ultimate goal is still the same.
- I'm glad you changed your mind.
- Me too.
Thanks for our little talk.
Yeah, my pleasure.
Let's see, you got a hankie.
Terrific.
- Got your keys?
Don't be out too late.
- Frasier!
Just busting your chops.
Oh, my God!
Will you two relax?
A word to the wise If she asks you up to her place after dinner, close the drapes.
Hi, Irene.
Nice to finally meet you.
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe, but I got you pegged # But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night everybody!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
You're listening to KACL, This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Our lines are open.
So please give us a call.
I'm just sitting here waiting.
Seattle, come on, I know you're out there.
I realise it's a sunny day, but on the rainy days I was there for you.
All right, if that's the way you want it, you leave me no recourse.
# When the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza # Ah, seems I got you going there, OK!
All right, then.
I knew you were out there.
OK, Roz, who do we have?
We have Gary on line two.
He and his wife had a fight.
Sorry to hear that, Gary.
I'm listening.
'My wife's hell-bent on going to Italy this year.
' Ah, Italia!
The rolling hills of Toscana, the art of Firenze, the passion that is Venezia!
'Yeah, well, anyway, I like taking a vacation as much as the next guy, 'but if we dip into our savings, 'we should buy a new sump pump for the basement ' Let me stop you there.
I'm siding with your wife here.
'But it's 1,800 bucks, without the Splendours of the Vatican package.
' There is more to life than sump pumps.
Whatever happened to feeding our souls?
I purchased a painting by one of our premier artists.
Oh, it's not important who.
Well, it's Seattle's own Martha Paxton.
Practical, no, but Ever since acquiring that painting, I look at it every day and every time I do, I'm uplifted by its beauty.
So, Gary, go to Italy.
Bring back a suitcase full of memories.
Will you do that?
'I still think I should get the sump pump.
' Well, then yes, Gary, you You should get the sump pump.
We'll be right back after this newsbreak.
Roz?
Uh, just what is a sump pump?
If you need one, you'll know.
Do you own a Paxton or were you blowing sunshine up Gary's skirt?
- Yes, indeed, I do own a Paxton.
- She's on line three.
A pre-eminent neo-fauvist and you put her on hold!
Well, the phone rang, I Ms Paxton, oh, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.
Well, thank you!
Yes.
I'm very flattered that you listen to my little show.
Yes, I meant every word.
That's lovely.
I'd like to meet you, too, sometime.
I'm having a few friends over for a little gathering this Friday night for some cocktails and such.
I suppose you're far too You would?
Oh, that's marvellous!
It's the Elliott Bay Towers, on the counterbalance, around 7:00 is fine.
Well, I'll see you then.
Ciao!
- I didn't know about your cocktail party.
- That makes two of us.
Me theory on death is, you're whisked down a dark tunnel towards a white light and you get all the jokes you never got before.
You let out a little chuckle and then you die.
Delightful story, but I think the toast points need replenishing.
Be right on it.
Enchanting.
Why is no-one eating the mousseline of duck?
You mangy little cur!
Get!
Get!
Get!
Oh!
Now we know why.
The dog is eating the food, the pianist is too intrusive, the Pinot Noir is far too stagy - It's 7:05, and Martha isn't here.
- I won't have to sedate you, will I?
No, I'm just on edge.
I want everything to be perfect.
Where's Maris?
I haven't seen her all night.
She's on your bed asleep under the guests' coats.
She exhausts easily under the pressure to be interesting.
- She should be looking after Dad!
- He's in the bathroom.
That must be La Paxton!
And fashionably late, of course!
Oh, hi, Roz, it's you.
- And you look radiant!
- I look like crap.
I stained my dress, over-plucked one eyebrow, and the crotch of my pantyhose is creeping down to my knees.
Why not do it on the elevator?
Oh, my goodness, you've got a neck!
What do you think?
Is it how you imagined?
To be frank, I don't spend my idle hours imagining how you live.
But I did expect lots of beige.
And look, I was right.
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure, something light.
Double bourbon, rocks, and spill a little in the glass.
Oh, Daphne, you're here, too.
My goodness, shouldn't you be mixing?
Don't mind me.
I'm just getting some ice.
- Lovely party, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
This fresh fennel smells wonderful, doesn't it?
It certainly does.
Dr Crane, were you sniffing my hair?
Why would I do that?
I'm married, I love my Maris.
- Where should I put this coat?
- Just throw it on the bed.
So, which one is your dad?
He's the gentleman showing Bethany Van Pelt the photographs.
Oh, my God!
When we got to her, it was hanging by two tendons.
Would you excuse us, please?
Stop showing crime scene photos.
She was the one who brought it up!
Oh, yeah, the Junior League head brought up the subject of a hooker who was dismembered and scattered in a warehouse?
She asked, "Are these meatballs the messiest thing you've ever seen"?
- And I said "no - Dad, please!
All right, but stop shadowing me!
I don't need a nursemaid!
All right, just give me your word.
Watch him!
Hi, Niles.
You may not remember me I do!
Be a love and watch that man with a cane.
Everyone!
Dr Crane?
- I'm Martha Paxton.
- Of course.
Who else could you be?
Welcome to my salon.
Everyone, your attention please!
Let's welcome our guest of honour, the renowned artist, Martha Paxton!
- May I take your poncho?
- No, I never take it off at parties.
- So I don't have to shake hands.
- How delightfully eccentric.
You must meet my brother Niles.
Oh, Niles!
Ms Paxton?
Dr Niles Crane.
It's an honour to shake your hand.
Well, to shake anything of yours is an honour.
Now, where did you hang my painting?
I'd like to know how people live with my work.
"Live with my work".
I love that phrase.
This way, please.
This is the perfect spot for an ideal viewing.
Oh, God I've waited so long for this moment.
I'll let you describe your work, "Elegy In Green," in your own words.
You insinuate the palette but never lean on it.
You've captured the Zeitgeist!
It's the most perfect canvas I've gazed upon.
One can only imagine what inspired you to paint it!
I didn't paint it.
Well, of course you didn't.
You created it, you gave birth to it.
I didn't do anything to it.
I never saw this painting before.
And you thought I was going to embarrass you.
- I liked your friend, Roz.
- What?
Roz, at the party tonight.
Nice gal.
Ask her out.
She's great-looking and she can really hold her liquor.
Dad, you mind?
I've had the most humiliating evening.
I've been made a fool of by this this thing.
I may be just a girl from Manchester, but I have to tell you.
Even though it's not a Paxton, I really like it.
I liked it before I even knew who Martha Paxton was and, frankly, I don't think that woman bathes.
Enjoy it while you can, because it's going back to the dealer.
I'll demand my money back.
No one takes advantage of Frasier Crane!
You're upset.
I'll return it for you.
I appreciate the gesture, but what do you know about the art world?
Apparently about as much as you do.
I can see the love in your eyes.
You must have this painting.
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I am, Philip Hayson.
- I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
- I have a little - The Dr Frasier Crane on the radio?
Guilty, yes.
My wife and I love your show.
Could I have your autograph?
But speaking of autographs, I have a problem with this painting.
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Actually We toured the Loire Valley and we bought four cases of this.
It's quite extraordinary.
- I'd rather not have any wine - Just a moment, just - Oh, it finishes well.
- Would you like more?
No, thank you.
I gave a small soiree which Martha Paxton attended and she told me that this painting was not her work.
I can imagine how embarrassing that was.
- I doubt it.
- Let's take a look at that in a slightly better light, shall we?
Oh, yes, I remember this.
It's breathtaking.
Ronald, Diane, will you step in here?
Remember when this piece was in the gallery, everyone wanted it?
Yes, it's special.
Mrs Chitcherelli wanted to buy it.
Yes, but it's not a Paxton.
It says here that it is a Paxton.
The signature Martha Paxton says it's not a Paxton!
- Oh, Martha!
How is the old dear?
- She and I go back a long way.
- Is she still?
- As a melon, yes.
- More wine?
- No, I want to discuss this painting.
- Some brie?
- No, I don't want any brie.
I want my money back!
That's where things might just get a bit prickly.
We have a strict policy here.
All sales are final.
- You'll make an exception.
- I can't.
- But it's a forgery.
- If it is, it's a damn good one.
I'll make this simple, I want my money.
I'm sure you do.
Oh, I know what you're doing.
You're agreeing with me, hoping I'll tire and leave.
- Whatever you say.
- I don't believe it.
You're shining me on!
Where is the justice in this?
If you ever find justice in this world, let me know, will you?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Did a crate of freshly painted Rembrandts just arrive?
You're not getting away with this.
I am not leaving!
I thought you were going to return it.
They wouldn't take it back.
All I got was a cheap glass of wine.
Loire Valley, my ass.
- Now what?
- I'll call the police.
- 555-3000.
- Thanks.
Try to mess with Dr Frasier Crane.
Hello Oh, just a second.
Dad, who do I ask for?
Fine Arts Forgery Department.
Hello, yes, the Fine Arts Forgery Department, please.
Dad!
They're laughing at me.
Give me the phone.
Hi, who's this?
Hey, Doris!
Yeah, Marty Crane.
Yeah, that was my son.
I just thought he needed a bite of a reality sandwich.
Yeah, give my best to the guys.
Thanks.
Yeah, bye.
- What was that?
- They handle murders and robberies.
No time for artsy-fartsy stuff.
What am I supposed to do?
I've been cheated!
What were you doing back there?
Maris lost her earring.
Daphne crawled under the bed to look for it while I Yes?
searched the credenza.
Maybe it was trampled into the hallway carpet when everybody stampeded for the elevator.
No one stampeded!
Good guests just know when to leave.
- Two hours early.
- Shut up!
Does this foul mood mean you were unable to unload the bogus Paxton?
Yes.
What's the name of that vicious lawyer you use?
The one I used to sue the contractor or to sue the personal trainer?
- The meanest.
- The second one.
- I used him to sue the first one.
- Give me his number.
Forget it.
Five years of litigation will be eight times the painting's price.
- I hate lawyers!
- They make wonderful patients.
They have excellent health insurance and they never get better.
I know, I can use my radio show.
I can use my bully pulpit to expose that man for the fraud he is!
They'll sue you for slander.
Where is the justice?
Where can I turn to?
I'm a beloved household name and I've been screwed!
You're 41.
It's time you learned something.
The system ain't perfect.
Sometimes the bad guy wins and things you thought would help you, the courts and the police, aren't there when you need them.
So let it eat a hole in your stomach or file it away under the heading "Sometimes life sucks".
That file's getting pretty thick.
So Hayson just gets away with it.
He's sitting there with his wine and his little chuckle at my expense.
I see why people take matters into their own hands.
It would be so satisfying to just slash his tyres or throw a brick through his window!
To show that you can't get away with this.
I know you would never resort to that sort of thing.
Would you, Frasier?
There's a vein throbbing in your forehead.
I couldn't find it, but I'll try something else.
Give me the other earring.
Maybe I'll get something.
Oh, yes, I'm getting a feeling.
It's in your father's room.
No, It's in Dr Crane's room.
No Oh, this is odd.
Now it's in the hallway.
Eddie!
Good evening.
Lovely night, isn't it?
Yes, well, uh Good night.
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing here?
- Stopping you from being stupid.
- I know this is wrong, but it's the only thing left for me!
All right, Frasier.
Just give me the brick and no one will get hurt.
- It's none of your business.
- It is.
- How.
- Remember in school when somebody took my clothes while I showered?
They hung them from the goalpost.
I had to get a ladder and climb up there wearing only a towel, wet and shivering.
Then the towel fell off.
There I was, hanging naked from a goalpost, and everyone was laughing, and Coach Medwick just stood there going Whatever that means.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I was so humiliated.
I went home, I cried my eyes out.
I swore I would get even.
I was just about to put sugar into Coach Medwick's gas tank, and you stopped me.
You said, "If you act like a barbarian, you will become one".
I said that?
- Actually, you were more verbose.
I had to listen while you were sitting on my chest.
- Give me the brick, Frasier.
- And let him get away with this?
What the gallery owner did was wrong and humiliating.
But if you throw that brick, you will have lost something more valuable than your money.
You will have lost your mind.
You can't do this!
If you could show restraint after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames - Nicknames.
There were nicknames?
- You didn't know that?
Dear God.
Peachfuzz, Jingle Bells I can't remember the rest.
- "Peachfuzz"?
- Coach Medwick made that one up.
Well, anyway, here you are.
I won't be needing this any more.
I'm proud of you.
- What have you done?
- Nobody calls me Peachfuzz!
Now let's get the hell out of here!
What are you doing?
We may be barbarians, but we pay for our pillaging.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my # Maybe I seem a bit confused # Yeah, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face # What is a boy to do?

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
It's 4:25, and this is Dr Frasier Crane.
- Who's our next caller?
- Hank has trouble with his neighbours.
Hello, Hank, I'm listening.
-  'Am I on?
' - Yes, you're on the air.
'Hello, am I on?
' Hank, listen.
Turn down your radio and just talk into your phone.
'Hello?
' You won't be able to hear yourself.
We're on a seven-second delay.
'Hello, can you hear me?
' For crying out loud!
Thank you, Hank.
People, turn off your damn radios!
Ah, no, I mean just those of you who are calling in!
Who's our next caller?
Marco has relationship problems.
Hello, Marco, I'm listening.
'I started seeing this woman two years ago.
'I think it was two years.
It was around Thanksgiving 'Yeah, the leaves were off the trees and ' Close enough.
What is your problem?
'Lt's not really my problem, it's more like her problem.
- 'She's pressing me for a commitment.
' - What's holding you back?
'I want to keep my options open, in case somebody better comes along.
' "Somebody better comes along".
"Somebody better comes along"!
Marco, do you hear yourself?
'No, I turned my radio off after you blasted that other guy.
' Listen, I suggest you give your motives a thorough examination, and if you can't commit, it's best for both of you to break it off.
- 'Yeah?
' - Yeah!
Thank you for your call.
Tell me, what is it with guys like that?
Hey, Roz, you've been around the block a few times.
Ever run into a guy like Marco?
Oh, they're all Marcos.
You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Marco.
If that was so, no one would be having a relationship.
Well, I'm not, my sister's not, none of my friends are.
I've seen the future.
Its name is Marco.
What do you think, Seattle?
Are there any non-Marcos out there, or is Roz destined to live a life of hopeless, loveless spinsterhood?
Back after this.
Gee, I just love it when you include me in your show.
This is weird.
It's not even Halloween yet.
Do we have to do this now?
Yes, if we want a picture for the Christmas card.
Why can't we just do what my wife and I did - put Frasier and Niles, in matching sweaters, on the old Packard.
Well, this year we're going to be a little more artistic.
Where is Frasier?
I could use help.
He's still napping.
My grandfather used to nap every day.
- He lived to be 93.
- Really?
He'd lie there on the sofa, and you couldn't wake him.
Grammy would say, "He might as well be a dead man".
Then, one day, we couldn't wake him.
He really was a dead man.
Poor Grammy.
For weeks, she kept insisting: "'E's napping, 'e's napping".
OK, I'm going to turn it on.
Oh, it's lovely!
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly # Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la # 'Tis the season to be jolly # Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la # Don we now our gay apparel # Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la # Excuse me, excuse me.
Exactly how long have I been asleep?
Good, you're up.
Now we can get this picture taken.
- What picture?
- The picture for the Christmas card.
Oh, right.
The theme is Santa's workshop.
Put on your little elf hats.
I'm not putting this on my head!
I'm a respected professional!
But if you don't, it'll look stupid!
The ship has already sailed on that one.
- Put the hat on!
- You can't tell me what to do.
I am telling you.
You can no longer sit me on top of some stupid old Packard!
Boys, please, don't fight!
Are you forgetting what day it is?
It's October 21!
- Can we just get the picture taken?
- I've got it all set.
Oh wait, where's Eddie?
In the bathroom, getting a drink.
Eddie!
Well, I can always pray there's a postal strike.
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane saying, "Go out there and make it a great evening, Seattle".
Hey, there's a fan in the hall who'd like your autograph.
Oh, God, save me from my adoring fans.
Oh!
But not from the adorable ones.
Hello.
You wanted an autograph?
Uh, how should I make this out?
You disgust me, you parasitic fraud!
That's certainly different from the usual "Best Regards".
For once you'll face the consequences of hanging up on callers!
What consequences?
I'm Marco's girlfriend Excuse me, ex-girlfriend, thanks to you.
The Marco who didn't want to commit?
You damned radio shrinks.
You couldn't just tell him to stick with it!
That doesn't get big ratings.
No!
"Get on with your life and ruin hers".
- That's entertainment.
- Hold on.
Did you listen to the show?
- No, but Marco told me what you said.
- Oh, he did, did he?
Did he mention he only stayed with you to keep his options open?
He said he only stayed with you until somebody better came along.
- He said that?
- To most of Seattle.
Apparently, you're the only one who missed it.
So, it wasn't that he didn't want to commit.
He just didn't want to commit to me.
I'm sorry I had to tell you, but at least now you know the truth.
Oh, no Don't don't cry.
Look, you're You're in a place of business here.
Boy, I can really pick 'em, can't I?
Don't go there.
Look, this is not your fault.
You're a terrifically attractive young woman, maybe a bit overemotional Oh, yes, there, there, shh.
- Listen, can I get you something?
- Mm-mm.
- A drink of water?
- No.
M & M's?
Plain or peanut?
- Whichever you like.
- Peanut.
God, I should have seen this coming.
He almost had a coronary, when I brought a toothbrush over to keep at his apartment.
- Thank you.
You want one?
- Uh, no, thanks.
Have a seat.
Listen, if he was that resistant, why did you stay with him?
I had a lot invested in it.
Why settle for someone who isn't madly in love with you?
Right now I'm not sure there are any men who are capable of falling madly in love.
There are.
Men and women are basically the same.
We both need to be loved and to love someone, we both want to feel that we matter to someone.
Making a commitment to another human being is the ultimate expression of our humanity.
Wow.
Your wife is really lucky.
Well, I'm sure she'd say the same thing.
Especially now that our marriage is over.
Maybe I will have one of those M & M's.
Oh, boy Why are relationships always so hard?
- Hey!
You like the yellow ones too?
- People tell you they're the same.
- But they're not!
- No!
Relationships don't have to be hard.
I heard of a documented case where a man and a woman met, got along, and actually lived happily ever after.
I don't mind the happily-ever-after-part.
It's the dating part.
If I have to tell one more stranger the story of my life over Northern Italian cuisine, I'll choke on a breadstick!
I know.
Maybe we could just exchange résumés over appetisers.
- I usually say goodbye over appetisers.
- At least you're not stuck with the bill.
You haven't dated much lately, have you?
No.
I usually end up in restaurants alone.
I can't do that.
I even turn on the TV at home so it feels like there's someone else there.
Is that what you'll be doing tonight?
Well, unless I just keep eating M & M's, which is a distinct possibility.
Soft and supple, yet strong right down to the beautiful almond-shaped nails.
- You really see all that in my hand?
- Mm-hm.
I'm late for work.
Wait.
What are we doing tonight?
"Antonio's", "Le Cigare Volant"?
- Why don't we just stay in?
- That's a great idea!
I'll send Dad and Daphne to the movies.
I'll cook for you.
Be at my place at 8:00.
I won't make it till 8:30.
I must change.
No!
Don't ever change.
I like you just the way you are.
Come on, I'm a little out of practice!
I'll see you later, OK?
Bye.
I'll dispense with the usual adolescent teasing.
Who was that babe-o-rama?
You remind me of Bob Hope when he dresses up as the Fonz.
- Her name is Catherine.
- How long have you known her?
- Three days.
- Have you two?
- No.
As if it's any of your business.
- But you're?
Yes, soon!
- We are talking about?
- Of course we are!
- Sex, right?
- Yes!
So How did you two meet?
She came down to the radio station to chew me out.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Her boyfriend called the show.
I advised him to break up with her.
Frasier, where are your ethics?
You can't date someone who's involved with your patient.
Marco is not a patient, he's a caller.
There's a huge difference.
I talked to him days before I met her.
Rationalisation, the last refuge of a  I am not rationalising!
There is nothing wrong here!
As long as your conscience is clear.
Mine wouldn't be.
Well, frankly, I don't care about your conscience.
I don't need your approval.
I don't need you for anything.
My car's in the shop.
I need a ride home tonight.
No problem.
I've got news for you, Marco's on line two.
Marco?
The guy you got out of the way so you could keep his girlfriend.
- Ten seconds.
- I'm not talking to him.
There's no way I'm talking to him!
Three, two Hi, we're back.
Roz, whom do we have on the line?
We have Marco on line two.
- Who's this on line three?
- Todd.
Oops, we lost Todd.
But lucky for you, we still have Marco on line two.
Thank you, Roz.
- Hello, Marco.
-  'Hi, Dr Crane.
'I spoke to you and I took your advice - I broke up with my girlfriend.
' Well, what can I say but "Bravo, Marco"?
- Who's next?
- 'Wait!
'You haven't heard my problem.
She's already dating someone else.
' - It makes me nuts.
- What makes you think that?
'The other night, I couldn't get her on the phone.
So I drove by her house, 'and I saw her outside talking to some guy in a black BMW.
' Did you, er, get a good look at the guy?
'No, it was too dark.
I think I made a big mistake, Doc.
'Should I ask her to take me back?
' No!
I mean, what I mean is No.
Marco, you don't want your ex-girlfriend back - you don't want anybody else to have her.
- 'Well, I ' - No, it's called "jealousy".
You must stop spying on her and get on with your life.
Borrow a page from my book: Move to a new city.
A new state.
Find out why everyone's talking about Pittsburgh!
We'll be right back after these messages.
What?
-  'Thanks for picking me up.
' - No problem.
Just a few miles out of my way.
At rush hour.
But I didn't mind, really.
Gave me a chance to listen to your show.
I see.
I just have one question for you.
Can you tell me that your advice to Marco was based on his best interests, and not on your own?
That's an interesting question, Niles, and I don't care.
I'm in love, and I don't care.
Catherine is mine now.
I'm in and Marco's out.
- You're insane!
- Perhaps, but you just ran a stop sign.
- Now we're in the intersection!
- Oh!
I tell you, Niles, I haven't felt this way in ages.
There's an excitement about this.
I I feel tingly.
- What does your stomach say?
- My stomach?
You know what I'm talking about.
Whenever you approached a breach of ethics, you'd get queasy.
At least I didn't get spontaneous nosebleeds.
Remember when we lifted that dollar from Mom's purse, we left a gruesome trail back to the tree house that day.
But, you see, you've proved my point.
I'm not the least bit queasy, I'm fine.
My head, my heart, my gastrointestinal system, all shout, "It's OK"!
Niles, is this a new car?
Yes, a patient of mine got me a huge break on a lease.
Frasier, do you have a handkerchief?
Mm, that was the best Salmon Marseille I've ever had.
You should try my Salmon "Enchanted Evening".
- Tell me you didn't say that.
- Oh, it was just the Lafite talking.
Lafite, don't fail me now!
Oh, stop, stop!
So have you ever made love in the kitchen?
Well, the, uh dishes are done.
Oh!
Mm!
'Ewww!
'  'What?
' I'm sorry, I'm suddenly feeling a little queasy.
I Maybe I'm just not a kitchen person.
Well, uh Maybe you're just a little too warm, huh?
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
- You look awfully warm too.
- Oh, I am!
Yes.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!
Oh!
Ooh!
I'm sorry.
Would you mind if we moved to the sofa?
I won't be outperformed by a Barcalounger.
Oh Oh!
This is better.
Oh, yes.
Mm Mm Ewww!
Ah What?
Was I kneeling on you?
I need some fresh air.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
Oh, damn, it wasn't the fish!
There's a bug going round.
- It's not a bug.
- What is it, then?
It's us.
Every time we touch and kiss, I get queasy.
The thought of making love to me makes you sick to your stomach?
Yes, but don't take it personally.
It's It's not you, it's me.
Every time I come close to breaching my ethics, I get sick.
What?
Marco called and said he wanted to get back with you.
- I told him not to.
- So?
Maybe I told him that not because it was good for him but good for me.
Oh, Frasier!
Who cares?
I care.
Any psychiatrist worth his salt would care.
That's why we don't get involved with our patients.
Or their girlfriends.
- Do you want to break up with me?
- I don't want to.
I have to.
If I don't, I'll throw up all over your shoes.
I can't believe this is happening.
How can this be so easy for you?
Easy?
This is killing me!
I want to carry you to that Eames classic and show you why it's the best-engineered chair in the world!
- Why don't you, then?
- I told you, I can't!
Oh!
And nothing I can say will change your mind?
I'm sorry.
Well, thank you, Dr Crane!
First you screw things up with Marco and now you're dumping me!
God, and to think I was going to have sex with you!
And it was going to be hot.
Oh, like you've never had before!
I'm talking steamy, sweat dripping down your back, neighbours pounding on the walls.
Illegal in 48 states kind of sex!
But, hey.
You're OK.
You won't be alone tonight.
No, you've got your ethics!
Oh!
Oh, by the way, The fish was dry.
Oh, that was a cheap shot!
How I envy you, Eddie.
The biggest questions you face are: "Who's going to walk me?
Who's going to feed me"?
I won't know that kind of joy for another 40 years.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # Maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe, but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Danielle, slow down a little bit.
I can't understand you.
'I have a problem with my monthieur.
' - With your what?
- 'My monthieur.
' Your monthieur?
'Oui, my monthieur, every day.
' Is that your mother?
Your masseur, your Mercedes?
'My monthieur!
You must help me!
' The best advice I can give you is to either confront your monthieur or work on your self-esteem.
Thank you for your call.
This is Dr Crane saying, "Have a good evening, you deserve it".
Roz, aren't you screening these calls?
Yeah, but when you only have one, you get less particular.
- You look nice.
- Yeah?
- I've got a date.
- Oh, great.
Why are you only wearing one heel?
You break it off?
No, I'm dating a sea captain with a peg leg.
It makes it easier when we dance.
I broke it off in a grate.
Who is this guy?
Another trendy kid who's got three earrings, a ponytail and a T-shirt under his coat?
- Is he here?
- Where do you meet these people?
For your information, he is a successful media consultant.
He graduated from Princeton, has a house on Mercer Island and a sailboat.
You met him on a bus, didn't you?
No, we shared a cab.
All right, he was driving it.
- Hello.
- You remember Roz?
- Yes.
What brings you here?
- Oh, nothing.
I was just passing by and thought I'd stop in for a career.
Good luck.
The entrance to your garage is blocked by a cab driver with a ponytail scraping gum off the seat.
Madam, your chariot awaits.
Better get going.
Oh, actually, bad news.
The lecture's been cancelled.
I wasn't relishing the idea of three hours on right-brain-left-brain-synergy.
I trimmed that speech to 21/2 hours and I open with a funny Al Gore joke.
Let's not cry over spilt milk.
Now, we have a free evening.
This is a perfect opportunity for two guys on the loose to hit a sports bar, have a coupla Brewskis, maybe take in a game.
Right.
What shall we do?
- Dinner?
- Perfect.
No place fancy.
We don't want a heavy meal with deserts.
- Your turn to pay?
- You know me so well.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Where I parked, the sign said it was just for customers of those stores.
It's fine.
I'll nip to Crabtree & Evelyn and buy a bar of lavender soap.
- You're a man!
You'd look ridiculous.
- Something to drink?
Fuzzy Navel blended nice and frothy.
- Martini, Niles?
- No, I'm driving.
- I'll buy some hand towels.
- Sit down!
Unless my eyes deceive me, that's Dad sitting over there.
You're right.
He said he was going to Duke's with the boys.
That certainly isn't the boys.
- It must be a clandestine rendezvous.
- Sly boots.
He didn't want us to know.
Oh, he's looking this way.
Turn around.
What are they doing?
It's sort of cute.
He's holding her hand Don't look!
I'll tell you when you can look.
Not now.
Not now.
OK, now.
No, not now!
- Oh, I don't like this one bit.
- What are they doing?
Nothing, but if Dad's eating here, this can't be a good restaurant.
- I wonder if it's their first date.
- They seem to be having a good time.
- What are they doing?
- They're talking.
He's smiling at her.
And she's just collapsed in tears.
She's sobbing uncontrollably.
Oh, yeah, that's a Crane first date all right.
She's coming this way.
Hide!
- You know who that is?
- She looked familiar.
- That was Marion Lawlor.
- I last heard that name as a kid.
Mom and Dad fell out with the Lawlors.
They did, when we shared a cabin.
Maybe Dad's just patching things up.
Doing his usual bang-up job.
This is awkward.
Let's get out of here.
No, if we leave now, he'll spot us.
- Maybe you should have that Martini.
- I can't, I'm driving.
Not any more.
They just towed your car.
You little hooligan, get off that couch!
You're not supposed to do that.
If Dr Crane sees you, he'll throw both of us off the balcony!
Good boy.
Now, you stay there.
Eddie Glad to see my rules about the couch are taking hold.
Good dog.
Dad, Daphne!
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello.
Where's Dad?
Mr Dorsey invited him over to watch the ballgame.
Great, he's getting to know the neighbours.
What?
- Why don't you grow a moustache?
- It wouldn't suit me.
- Oh, yes, it does.
- You've never seen me with one.
I have.
There's a billboard for your show down on 16th Street.
- Some kids spray painted you.
- It looked good?
Oh, yes.
But a word to the wise.
Take care of your teeth - that look is not flattering on you.
I'll get it.
Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello.
- What brings you here?
A Rent-a-car, thanks to my brother.
- I assume you're here for a reason.
- Yes.
Frasier, last night when I got home, that incident with Dad and Mrs Lawlor made me think what caused the rift between our families.
So I dug out my old boyhood journal and looked up my entries from our last summer together at the lake.
According to this, there was a three-week period where Mom and Dad had screaming matches every night.
- I don't recall that.
- That's right.
That was when you wore the wax earplugs and the slumber mask.
You were looking at the "National Geographic" with a flashlight.
- I was looking at the maps.
- That's what makes it scary.
What was your point?
Something more provocative happened during that same period.
Here.
Read this.
"Though summer at the lake seems but a vapid, vacuous experience, "it is a tonic for my troubled youth".
How old were you when you wrote this?
Almost nine.
Which explains the redundancy "vapid" and "vacuous".
By ten, my writing had gotten tighter.
Among other things.
The point is that I crept out onto the screen porch, leaving the lights off so as not to attract bats and moths.
As I peered out through the darkness, between the trees I saw Dad and Mrs Lawlor in each other's arms.
It's clear what happened.
Dad and Mrs Lawlor had an affair.
I appreciate your attempt to spice up our family history, but we're not a Jackie Collins novel.
It's ridiculous.
Is it?
All right, allow me to present exhibit "B".
This is a photo album Mom prepared of the same period.
I love to see old family photos.
My goodness, what a handsome, sinewy young bloke!
That was Dad.
You two take after your mother, don't you?
All right.
Look at this.
That's Dad, but the person next to him has been cut out.
And here, you can still see the edges of a dress and a handbag and sandals.
Who's that scrawny chap with the fish-belly complexion and rain hat?
I was under doctor's orders to stay out of direct sunlight.
We don't know that was Mrs Lawlor.
It wouldn't prove they had an affair.
- What?
- Niles thinks Dad had an illicit affair.
- Your father?
He's not the type.
- That's what I think.
- And there's not enough proof.
- Is it impossible?
- Anything is possible.
- Why don't you ask him?
Right.
"Father, did you boff a neighbour while we were roasting marshmallows"?
Ah.
There's one sure way to get the truth.
- We'll call Aunt Vivienne.
- Who's that?
Better known as the Mouth.
- We are not calling her.
- You afraid of finding out something?
Yes, that she knows where I live and she still drives.
You two are worse than gossipy washerwomen.
The way to solve this is to ask your father.
Ask me what?
Your sons have some cockeyed notion that you had an affair 30 years ago.
What?
- Where did that idea come from?
- Frasier saw you with Marion Lawlor.
- You were with me!
- You were spying on me?
No, we were just having dinner when you were "with your buddies".
That proves I had an affair?
No, but Niles remembered this time when he saw you and her hugging.
It was the time when you and Mom were fighting a lot.
- Then you stopped seeing the Lawlors.
- This is stupid!
Right.
They were even going to give some Aunt Vivienne a call.
Daphne, would you give me a minute alone with these two?
I understand.
Send the help to the room.
I never get to hear any good stuff.
Don't bother calling Aunt Vivienne.
You want to know the truth?
Fine.
I had an affair.
It happened long ago and it's not anything I'm proud of.
Now that I've answered everything, do me a favour.
This is never to be brought up again, understand?
End of discussion.
Well It's times like this that most families pull together and draw strength from each other.
What shall we do?
Thank you.
I came to see how you are, but I only have a few minutes.
I start my "healing with humour" support group tonight and I must pick up my big shoes.
How am I doing?
How are you doing, Niles?
Doesn't it bother you that your father cheated on my mother?
Your loyalties are seeping through.
Besides, I got Mom's small features while you got Dad's chunky thighs.
It must have caused Mom a lot of pain.
Agreed, but they went on and had a very happy life together.
They got over it.
Why can't you?
Rationally, I should be able to handle this.
I deal with human frailty every day.
But in this case, it's not people - one of our parents had an affair.
How could Dad cheat with Marion knowing the effect it would have on Mom and us?
Why don't you just pull up a chair and join us?
I just can't believe that it's it's our father.
I never had a great relationship with him, but I always respected his integrity.
Just thinking about what he did sickens me.
As your brother, as a therapist, I think you have to let this go.
You should come to my "healing with humour" support group.
Thank you, but I need a night to myself.
If you change your mind, it should be a hoot.
As we speak, I'm wearing oversized polka-dot boxers and quick-release suspenders.
I see all sorts of things have been going on behind my back!
Get!
- Frasier?
- Yes.
You may not remember me.
Marion Lawlor.
- Yes, I remember you.
- Is your Dad home?
No, but if you come back later, you can have the place to yourselves.
No, that's not necessary.
We had dinner the other night, and I left rather abruptly.
I wanted to tell him I'm sorry.
Would you please give him my best?
I think you've already done that.
Is this a bad time?
You seem upset.
Would you come in for a moment?
After you met with Dad the other night, he and I talked, and I learned what happened that summer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not the kind of person who can hear news like that and just forget about it.
I know you're upset.
But if it's any consolation, in time, your father and I forgave them.
Forgave them?
Your mother was a good person.
So was my husband.
They made a mistake.
Anyway, tell your father I stopped by.
I felt so silly crying the other night.
I've been a little overemotional since Dan died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
You never realise how hard that's going to hit you.
Look who I'm telling this to!
The famous radio psychiatrist Dr Frasier Crane!
I remember you when you ran around in your undies with your pail and shovel.
Yes, well, I rarely get to the shore any more.
Well, goodbye, Frasier.
Goodbye.
Working on the docks has always been a tradition for us Moons.
Me father worked on the docks, me grandfather.
All me brothers do.
Well, except for Billy.
He came home one day, saying he hated the smell of fish.
He was going to teach ballroom dancing.
And he did.
And he does.
He's me mum's favourite.
Dad flicks the crust off his kidney pie at him.
How much longer do I have to do this?
Be patient.
You don't want to drag your leg behind you like a dead branch.
I'm talking about listening to your family's history.
Why would a man of your intelligence say a thing like that when you're in the position you're in, and I'm in the position I'm in?
All right.
'Up you come.
' That's much better.
I'll go run your bath.
Hi, Dad.
You look kinda tired.
I just finished my exercises with Nurse Ratchet.
- Do you have to watch TV right now?
- Yeah, my programme's on.
If either of us could work the VCR, we'd tape it, but There's something I'd like to talk about.
Oh, for God's sake.
I've told you everything I'm going to.
Now drop it.
Dad - Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- I did.
Marion Lawlor came by today to apologise for the other night.
While she was here, she told me what really happened.
So now you know.
You stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Are you happy now?
- Why didn't you tell me it was Mom?
- Cos it's none of your business!
I understand you being defensive, but I had a right to know.
This happens to a lot of people.
If it's any consolation, I know exactly how you feel.
I never told you this, but Lilith did the same thing to me.
Lilith had an affair?
It was the most humiliating experience of my life.
I'm sure you felt the same way.
I hadn't thought about it for some time, but thanks for reminding me.
Lilith?
I found her attractive!
Is it strange another man might, too?
I guess.
- Who was the bozo in your case?
- Oh, God.
A Frenchman who lived in a self-contained underground ecopod.
That still sounds better than a urologist with a bad comb-over.
I'm sorry.
Look, do me a favour.
Don't hate your mother for this.
I wasn't easy to live with, and she had plenty of reason for doing what she did.
Luckily, we were able to put it behind us, but I'll tell you at times it tore me up.
I loved your mother.
So did I. I know, son.
That's why I said I was the one who had the affair.
I was just trying to protect her.
Me, you already had problems with.
I appreciate what you did, but you should have told me.
Listen.
When Frederick grows up, will you tell him what Lilith did to you?
OK.
- Can I watch my programme now?
- One second.
I gotta clear one thing up.
There's this photo album.
There's all these pictures with the same woman cut out of them.
What else do you notice, Sherlock?
Like, where's your mother?
- Oh, that was Mom!
- Yes.
She cut herself out of it.
She'd put a few pounds on.
She wore a brown dress with a belt.
Aunt Vivienne said she looked like a knackwurst tied in the middle.
We've been trying to find something we have in common.
- I think we finally found it.
- Yeah.
- Wish it was a birthmark.
- So do I. # Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# Maybe I seem a bit confused Yeah maybe, but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do With those salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face # What is a boy to do?
# Thank you!

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
'I had a really good year.
So why not reward myself?
'So I bought a 48ft cabin cruiser.
'I'll tell you how much it cost me, '300 grand plus $20,000 for the custom teak decking.
'My problem is that my wife wants to call 'this incredible vessel "Lullubelle", after her mother.
"'Lullubelle"!
I want to call it "The Intrepid".
'So, what do you think, "Lullubelle" or "The Intrepid"?
' At Cornell University, they have an incredible piece of equipment known as the "tunnelling electron microscope".
This microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons, you can actually see images of the atom, the minute building block of our universe.
If I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in your problem.
Thank you for your call.
And now, "Hungry for Chinese?
I always" I'm sorry.
We're experiencing technical difficulty.
Let's go to a pre-recorded commercial message.
What's this?
I don't do personal endorsements.
- The other personalities do them.
- They aren't doctors.
If I allow myself to become a pitchman, I lose all my credibility.
I am a wise man, a shaman.
Zip up your fly, wise man.
Whoa!
Doc, this is a radio studio, not a bus terminal.
Look who's here, Noël Coward.
I hate to mix business with revulsion but Frasier, as usual, will not do this promo.
Love to, no problem.
Doc, with all due respect, you're an idiot.
These promos are easy money.
It's a question of integrity.
Integrity.
Hello!
We're talking mucho dinero.
But the more you turn these down, the more Liver Snaps for the Bulldog.
What is this with my name on it?
The Hunan Palace gig contract.
It's how much they'd pay you.
- I'll change the name to "Bulldog".
- They pay you that much to read copy?
Yes.
Bulldog adds his special touch.
You will come, chop chop to Hunan Palace, where Peking duck is always extra crispy.
We're gonna get sued this time for sure.
Damn it!
Put a dent in my bumper when I pulled into my parking space.
What happened to the tennis ball I hung over my space so I wouldn't pull up too far?
He was bored.
He needed a toy.
Go ahead and throw it.
He'll run and get it for you.
He didn't think that was funny and he knows where you sleep.
A situation has arisen over at work, I'm not sure how it should be handled.
Maybe your objective viewpoint could be helpful.
Sure.
Should I publicly endorse a product?
Oh, you mean like Cher does?
Thank you, one against.
Dad?
- What's the product?
- It's for a Chinese restaurant.
What's the problem?
I hold a position of trust in the community.
People do what I tell them to and I could be accused of abusing that.
The thought of a doctor selling things is distasteful.
What about Dr Sneezy's cold medicine?
Dr Sneezy is a cartoon character.
The fact that he's a giant purple hippo should have tipped you off.
Take the money and run.
I'm tempted, mainly to keep Bulldog from alienating the Asian-American community.
I'd hate to compromise my principles.
You've dedicated your life to helping people, haven't you?
Yes.
If your listeners were in a quandary over where to buy good Chinese food, your commercial would help them.
Try the food, if you like it, do the commercial.
That's logical.
Why don't we all go tonight?
I better make the reservations under a different name.
I don't want any special treatment.
I want to be treated like I'm just an average working Joe.
Good evening.
Yes, yes.
We'd like a reservation for three at 8:00.
Oh, nothing till 10:00?
Oh.
Well, then, uh This is Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio and Yes, I thought you might.
Thank you.
We're in at 9:45.
Did I say tasty?
Tasty doesn't do justice to those succulent pot stickers.
And the Kung Pao chicken.
Ooh, don't get me started.
So if you've got a yen for Chinese, hurry to the Hunan Palace.
This is Dr Frasier Crane hoping we'll see you tomorrow on KACL 780AM.
I'm getting the knack for these promos.
Did you hear my "yen" ad lib?
Yeah.
By the way, "yen" is Japanese, not Chinese.
I got a call from the Hunan palace the other day.
- Isn't that what advertising does?
- Yes, it is, Miss Sour Britches.
Give me a little credit.
I please the boys upstairs, I got people to try a new restaurant, and I've helped a struggling immigrant family who came to these shores with little more than a dream, a few recipes and a wok.
- Dr Crane, what a privilege this is.
- Excuse me?
- Bebe Glazer, Bulldog Brisco's agent.
- Pleasure meeting you.
I'm usually not this forward, but I know nobody represents you.
How would you feel about signing on with me as a client?
- No, I don't think so.
- Why?
I am flattered.
But I'm not really a radio personality per se.
I've heard those spots you've done for that restaurant.
You make me want to stuff my face full of egg rolls and I don't know what.
Thank you, eh but, I dine at the Hunan Palace frequently that's why I did those commercials.
I don't want you to advertise something you don't believe in.
- I am an agent, not a pimp.
- I don't mean to offend - You're terrific.
Here's my card.
- That's not necessary Give me back my card.
It is too refreshing to meet someone not seduced by the almighty dollar.
I would refuse your call.
I've got to go, flying to Palo Alto.
My daughter's at Stanford.
Ah.
Wait.
You don't have kids, do you?
- I have a five-year-old son.
- You won't have to worry about it yet.
- Worry about what?
- Tuition, innocent.
Ah, you're going to send him to a state college.
No, I had planned to send him to my alma mater, Harvard.
Ouch.
Kiss it and make it better.
Have you seen the projections for college costs the year 2010?
I've got to go.
That plane is not going to wait for me.
Maybe we should talk sometime.
Let's talk now.
I think I can die peacefully without seeing the Stanford-Cal game.
I don't object to doing commercials, but I'd have to try a product first before I could endorse it.
Dr Crane, I wouldn't have it any other way.
Why am I here?
If I do the commercial, I have to say my friends and family enjoy this.
I feel silly in this showroom.
I apologise, but it's the best place to try.
Aren't you enjoying this?
I do like the bubbles.
It's a little like sitting in hot champagne.
Not that I've done that very much.
It's made from the same space-age polymer as the NASA space shuttles?
Next time I'm re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in a hot tub, I won't worry.
Well, do you like it?
It is making my hip feel a little better.
So my friends like it, my family likes it, I like it.
I can do the commercial and Frederick can go to Harvard.
Oh, my God, isn't that Dave Hendler from our building?
You know he's the head of the Seattle Psychiatric Association!
- That's not Dave Hendler.
- Shh, don't worry about it.
Enjoy the quiet while you can.
'Gentle, soothing bubbles, bubbles that will ease your aching body.
'This is Dr Frasier Crane.
In these pressure-packed times, 'what could be better than a relaxing dip in a Redwood hot tub?
'Let Redwood's patented 'Ultra-Blow' air system surround your body.
- 'My family and friends like it.
' - That's us.
'Lf you act quickly, you'll receive a complimentary scum guard.
'Hurry to your local Redwood hot tub dealer.
Say Frasier Crane sent you' - What did you think?
- I could almost smell the chlorine.
- Dad, how about you?
- I liked it.
- You REALLY liked it?
- No, I liked it.
- What was wrong with it?
- Nothing!
- You hated it?
- Yeah.
- Hello, darling.
- Bebe!
Mea culpa for dropping by unannounced you'll kiss me when you hear what I've done.
Oh Hello.
No, no, this is Daphne Moon, my father's physical therapist.
Oh!
So, I was about to kiss you for something.
Well, I got a very attractive offer for you to be a product spokesman and we know they're serious, cos it's "pay or play".
You get your money whether you do it or not.
- Listen.
- How do you know?
I must confess, there is a chapter of my life I haven't told you or your father about.
When I was 12, I starred in a TV show in England.
- I'll leave you to your business.
- Get back here.
You what?
I starred in a TV series.
It was quite popular in its day.
Maybe you've heard of it, "Mind Your Knickers"?
It was about a group of high-spirited ethnically diverse I played Emma, the short, spunky one.
By the end of the series, I was 16, 5ft 10in, and they had my boozies bound up tighter than a mummy.
Well, I'm off.
The woman is like an artichoke.
You just keep peeling away one astounding leaf after another.
Back to business.
What have you got?
Voila Emery's nuts!
No, I can't endorse these.
- Why not?
- I don't like them.
- Of course they do, they're nuts.
- Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.
Well I will just tell them they can take their five-figure deal and find someone else.
- Five figures.
- This is for TV, the Big Kahuna.
Television.
But I understand if you have a problem.
Well, I l I don't mean to be difficult.
I only endorse things I like or that are therapeutic, like the hot tub.
Let me pinch you.
You're not real!
Well But still, I wonder if you're not being just the tiniest bit short-sighted.
Research has shown that a single TV commercial can turn an obscure radio personality into a national celebrity!
A year from now, you could be broadcasting your message of healing not just to the Pacific Northwest but to the entire nation.
But, of course, there's not much I can do about it if you don't like the product.
You can't be serious.
That's a nose people trust.
Your script!
Thanks Jeff.
I've seen it.
You're going to love it.
"Two nuts are arguing with each other".
"I'm a nut".
"No, I'm a nut".
That's funny.
"Hold it.
You're both nuts.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist, and I know a nut when I see one".
I don't know about that line.
- Oh.
What's wrong?
It's a scream.
- Maybe, but it's What's the word I'm looking for?
What, "tuition", "retirement beach house"?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's just that I want so much for you.
I don't mean to be difficult, but I'm not comfortable with this line.
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.
- How long have we been together?
- Six days.
Would I ever have you do something you were uncomfortable with?
It's wonderful because you're showing that psychiatrists can be loose, making shrinks more accessible to people.
So I'd be doing psychiatry a service?
You have a way of cutting through the baloney that knocks me out cold.
Oh dear, what does this mean, "Frasier comes out of his shell"?
It's a A technical term it's a lighting thing.
You see, you come out of your shadow or your shell, into the light.
I have so much to learn about this business.
Niles, I have to talk to you.
What's that ridiculous tissue?
They didn't tell me I could take it off, so I kept it on.
Silly me, I thought it was to grab attention so people say, "Are you an actor"?
Affording you the opportunity to say you are an actor and then crow, gloat and strut in a way you could not otherwise do.
And the reason you have "shrink" on your licence plate would be?
I have this commercial in half an hour, I don't think I can go through with it.
I'm afraid I'm compromising my integrity.
- Why do you feel like that?
- My co-stars are almonds and walnuts.
Listen Niles, I need your guidance.
- I don't see this as a problem.
- This isn't selling out?
Oh, no.
You sold out a long time ago.
Your call-in show was selling out.
You are such a purist.
OK, I can't do in-depth analysis, but my show helps thousands of people.
You talk about wanting to safeguard your professional dignity.
When you went on the air, you left medicine for show biz.
Like that movie star who let everyone look up her skirt then complained nobody took her seriously.
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Have you seen that movie?
Maris and I rented the video.
I don't mind telling you we pushed our beds together that night.
And that was no mean feat.
Her room is across the hall.
Just tell me, would you do it?
A nude scene?
If it were integral to No!
This commercial!
No, I'm a respected psychiatrist.
You mean I shouldn't do it?
No.
I'm saying it doesn't matter.
They've already looked up your skirt and they've seen everything there is to see.
What are you still doing up?
Oh, geez, you're not watching that tape of that dumb commercial again!
I can't get it off my mind.
Did I do the right thing?
Of course, Freddy will thank you for it.
Watch it with me one more time.
'I'm a nut.
' 'No, I'm a nut.
' - ' No, I'm a nut.
' - 'I'm a nut.
' 'Stop!
You're both nuts.
'I'm a psychologist, Dr Joyce Brothers.
'I'm here to tell you that I'm just crazy about Emery's nuts.
'So, if you're crazy about nuts too, pick up a can of Emery's today.
'Emery's, the nut lover's nut.
' I suppose you're right.
Dad.
Freddy will thank me.
Dr Joyce is his favourite psychologist.
I remember Dr Joyce from "The Hollywood Squares".
She was always under Charlie Weaver.
No, Weaver was always on the bottom.
No, let's see, Paul Lynde was in the middle.
George Gobel was on the end and where was Wally Cox?
Wally Cox upper left next to Rose Marie to block.
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # Maybe I seem a bit confused, Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again Good night, everybody!

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I had to get out of the house.
Maris's Junior League is rehearsing their spring musical "Cats".
I've been watching two dozen underweight women in leotards crawling around the room meowing.
- My allergies are acting up.
- You're exaggerating.
No.
The experience is very vivid.
As God is my judge, I swear Mrs Presley-Bismuth was scent-marking the divan.
Women that age should know better - remember "The Sound Of Music"?
Half the von Trapp children were having hot flashes.
Hi, Frasier, Niles.
The wacky gang from the office?
My brother, Niles.
Teddy, our engineer.
Teddy, my man.
This is KACL's own Chopper Dave, your eye in the sky for traffic!
Nice to meet you, Niles!
- Why is he yelling?
- Oh, God, I was yelling again.
I'm sorry, talking over the blades, you know!
Whoop, whoop, whoop!
This has been kind of fun.
But I really have to go.
I'm conducting a seminar on multiple personalities and it takes forever to fill out the name tags.
Well, KACL team, what is on the agenda for today?
I've got a juicy piece of news.
And it's reliable: Alan in Accounting got it from Stephen in Promotions, who got it from the manager's secretary.
The station is way over budget and somebody's getting the axe.
But don't tell anybody.
I was sworn to secrecy.
Gossip sullies good people's names and creates suspicion and mistrust!
Gossip is the lifeblood of the corporate world!
If it wasn't for gossip, we wouldn't know how much everybody makes.
You know my salary?
No one's salary's a secret!
98, 99, 100!
New high for me!
Squeezing or counting?
Java to go!
Father Mike from "Religion On The Line" is getting dumped!
No!
Station just gave him a bonus.
Hey, where's my tickets to the "Sonics" game?
Somebody stole my tickets to the "Sonics" game!
That stinks!
This is Oh, got 'em, got 'em.
You don't think Bulldog's getting canned?
Could be.
He's our top personality, except for women 35 to 54 who think that I'm sort of a God.
But he complained about his salary.
He screamed about having his expense account on hold.
-  Oh, yeah, bulldog's out!
- Shh!
Have you heard my new gimmick for the show?
If the Seahawks beat Buffalo, I'll do my show hanging by my feet.
You can do that?
!
Oh, sure.
The real trick is drinking coffee.
I keep burning my eyes.
Want my tickets to the Sonics game?
Thanks!
Why aren't you going?
Station manager wants to see me after work.
You're jumping to conclusions.
Bulldog has devoted 15 years to radio He shouldn't become the object of some scurrilous rumour that, as yet, hasn't a shred of truth to it.
I suppose you're right.
Just in case, I've got dibs on his parking space.
We have Don on his car phone.
He's having a weight problem.
Don, it's a common problem.
I'm listening.
'I eat healthy, I work out, but I can't lose a pound.
' Losing weight is a struggle, it takes a commitment.
If you're ready to accept that, I could suggest  'May I take your order, please?
' - Don, what was that?
' - Oh, it was the radio.
' - Don, where are you?
- 'I'm just driving around.
'  'Please speak into the clown's mouth.
'  'I'm going into a tunnel!
Bye!
' Yes, and the light at the end of that tunnel is a heat lamp over a large order of fries.
We'll be right back after the news.
- I got to run up to Payroll.
- OK.
Oh, hi, Father Mike.
Oh, hello, Frasier.
I heard a rumour that somebody is being let go.
Do you know anything?
I'm afraid it might be me.
Don't put any stock in office gossip.
I know, but my numbers have been down lately.
They keep changing my time slot.
I'm really bummed!
I don't like to engage in gossip but you have nothing to worry about.
Why?
Someone is being let go.
It's not you, it's Bulldog.
Bulldog?
Oh, what a shame.
Has anybody spoken for his parking space?
I have.
So I'm a goner, huh?
Bulldog, how long have you been?
I know I'm out.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
Damn it!
Ned Miller wants to see me to can my butt!
Why would he miss happy hour at "El Paquino's"?
He's a boozer!
This is just a rumour.
After all I've done for this station!
This is how they repay me?
No, I'll quit first!
Now, don't do anything rash.
Try to vent your anger first.
Well, good.
Way to go.
Now, on your way.
You're damn right!
Hey, Bulldog.
No time to talk, Slim!
I'm off to war!
- Ugh!
- Wait for me!
- What was that?
- He's quitting.
- Why?
- Because Ned Miller is firing him.
- Who told you that?
- You did.
That was just a rumour.
You didn't tell him?
!
- He overheard me.
- Oh, God!
You guys were so positive!
The meeting tonight It was to discuss taking his show national!
Don't you know anything?
Apparently not!
Go call his secretary!
She can stop him!
I don't believe it.
This is incredible!
Arlene?
Bob Brisco's about to jump into the office Oh, he did?
He's already burst into the office with Miller.
God, this is a disaster!
Maybe before he starts, Miller will tell him what the meeting was about.
You're right.
They may be having a good laugh about this right now.
We're on in one minute!
I did it!
I scorched him!
I told him his wife came on to me at the Christmas party, but no amount of liquor would make me sleep with that porker!
- You said that to Ned Miller?
- Yeah, he even took a swing at me.
But I gave him a little okey-doke!
My God, the man tried to strike you?
No sudden moves.
I'm too pumped.
I feel like popping someone!
He has quit because of a rumour you spread!
ME?
!
The point of gossip is to talk behind the person's back!
You're unclear on this concept?
!
I'm a bad, bad man.
You've got to call Ned Miller and get this whole thing cleared up.
The man is unstable.
He took a swing at me the day he hired me.
I just heard a hot rumour!
Bulldog quit!
Keep it under your hat, Very Hush hush!
Oh, Niles, what brings you here?
I was hoping Daphne could take a look at this plant.
I bought it for Maris but it, unaccountably, turned against her.
I thought Daphne could nurse it back to health with her soft, sensual hands and her loving manner.
Is she here?
- She stepped out.
- Oh, well, I'm off.
Wait!
You can stay.
We can visit.
Oh.
Well, yes, we could, couldn't we?
- So how are you?
- Fine.
You?
Fine.
She's fine.
- Pickle?
- No, thanks.
If you just came to see Daphne, you don't have to stay.
How can you say that?
I am insulted!
I wanted to have some time with you but now I'm so upset I have to leave.
- Hello.
Staying for dinner?
- Yes, love to.
Could you coax this back to life?
It's Maris's favourite.
- What did she do to it?
- Nothing, just loved it.
What weather!
- What happened to Bulldog?
- Who told you?
I just tuned into the gonzo sports show today and they had Father Mike filling in.
I hate that!
All it was was "Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Notre Dame".
Bulldog tendered his resignation.
Oh, no!
Why?
He's the top sports guy in town.
It's a tough business, this radio game.
I'm picking up something from you.
You're shrouded in an aura of guilt.
Maybe I am.
That's fantastic!
Do me, do me!
No, I'm onto something here.
You think you're responsible for Bulldog losing his job!
Frasier?
I was repeating a rumour that Bulldog was going to get sacked.
He overheard me, blew up, quit his job.
The rumour wasn't true.
Of course, you already knew that, didn't you?
Oh, excuse me.
Hello?
Maris Maris, what's wrong?
Oh, pumpkin.
No, no, everything's going to be Oh, dear.
I have to go.
Maris is despondent.
They kicked her out of "Cats".
Why?
She couldn't remember the words to "Memory".
If you are responsible for getting Bulldog sacked, you must go to his boss and get him his job back.
Ned Miller's the most mean-spirited man I've ever met.
And he cheats on his wife.
My goodness, I'm on today!
So you're selling Bulldog down the river?
This might be for the best.
He thinks he should be in a larger market, like LA or New York and Eddie, scoot, scat!
- Bulldog?
- Hiya, doc.
Why are you just standing there?
I was trying to decide whether or not I should bother you.
My life is kind of over, but you got company No, no, come in.
It's just family.
This is my dad and Daphne Moon.
Hey, Bulldog!
You're soaking wet.
- I've been wandering the streets.
- I heard what happened.
You haven't heard the half of it.
And my girlfriend threw me out.
She said she was only with me because I was on the radio.
Eight years we've been together.
Even when I was tomcatting around, I loved that woman.
God!
That job was my life, and now I've been blackballed in this business because of my stupid temper.
What is this, anyway?
That's a rare fertility symbol from a small nomadic tribe in Ghana.
When they passed out equipment, this guy was in the back of the line.
I might as well face it.
I'm just a loser, I'm a zero, - I'm nothing, a has-been.
- Pickle?
Mr Crane often puts off his nightly bath just so he can hear your show.
You're the greatest!
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have a radio.
That's a nice thing to say.
Now I know why your son is such a great guy.
Hey, I bothered you people enough.
I better go.
The good rooms at the "Y" fill up early.
Wait, Bulldog.
I can't let you leave like this.
Here's a 20.
Oh, all right.
Why don't you just spend the night?
Take the couch.
- You'd do that for me?
- Why have a priceless couch unless you've got people crashing on it?
- Thanks.
- I could use a hot shower.
- Oh, sure.
- Down the hall, second door left.
You two just leave me alone.
This is not my fault.
I am not responsible for him going up there and popping off to the boss.
You can stare at me all you want.
I am not going to go see Ned Miller.
Oh, all right!
I'll go to the station, talk to the monster, attempt to get Bulldog his job back and probably end up spitting out my teeth like Chiclets.
Anything else I can do?
Oh, we're low on dog food.
What?
What?
I don't mean to disturb you, but Arlene wasn't I let her go.
What she's been doing lately has been ticking me off.
- If this is a bad time - It's a perfect time.
Hold this.
Come on!
Now!
- Come on.
- OK, how's this?
I'd love to tell you, but your big head's in the way.
- Oh, put it down.
- What happened here?
!
That psycho Bulldog and I got into it this afternoon.
He threw my Golden Mike at me.
He did that with your little trophy?
He just chipped the paint.
I did that with his head.
That's sort of why I'm here.
- Drink?
- No, thank you.
I know that Bulldog was here and said some regrettable things to you.
I'll say.
You want to hear them?
I tape everything in this office.
Well, anyway, a lot of what he said was my fault, you see.
I heard a rumour that management was thinking about lightening the load.
I heard that it was Bulldog that was going to get sacked and I was repeating it to someone, he heard me.
That's why he told you.
That I'm a drunk, incompetent, that my wife is a big fat slut!
That is indefensible!
Your wife is not overweight!
Anyway, my point is, I'd like you to consider giving Bulldog his job back and whatever the consequences to me, I'm willing to accept it.
Bulldog meant big numbers to us.
We need him back.
You get him to apologise to me Oh, hell, why don't I just say it?
If he'll kiss my ass, maybe we can work something out.
I'm sure that'll make him so happy.
Well, I'll just get out of your hair.
Actually, that rumour about someone being let go: It's true.
What?
Now that you've got Bulldog his job back, we need further cutbacks in those high-priced salaries.
- Oh, God, not Father Mike!
- No, it's not him.
Chopper Dave?
Ray the "Greengrocer"?
Bonnie "The Auto Lady" Weems?
Look, Crane, you're new to the radio game.
I've been around a long time.
People get fired but they always get back on their feet.
So I bet I could get you that drink now.
Yes, I bet you could.
Help yourself.
Ned Miller!
Yo, Jack!
No, what's wrong?
Come on, tell me now.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Yeah, I see.
No, no, I I got it.
Thanks, Jack.
Excuse me.
Bad news?
I've just been fired.
They decided the best way to cut the budget was to get rid of MY salary.
Oh, Ned, I I'm so sorry.
Does this mean my job is still safe?
I guess so.
Well, you know, Ned, I haven't been in the radio game that long but I've been around long enough to know that people get fired.
But they always land on their feet.
I've counselled a few people like you.
In time, you will embrace this, think of it as a new chapter.
In theatrical circles, they always say, "Every exit is but an entrance to somewhere else".
God, I wish I had fired you when I had the chance.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# Maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again Good night!

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
No, I've never had a serious boyfriend.
No one's really been interested.
Men can be such pigs.
People did try to fix me up.
In Manchester, me mum was steering me towards the butcher's son.
Pasty little thing, didn't fancy him.
I suppose I like my gents more on the manly side.
Was that a little swan you made?
No, it was a B-52.
Dr Jennings rang.
Dad skipped his physical again!
No wonder he didn't want me to go with him.
You know Dad's aversion to doctors.
Why didn't you take him?
I had my "fear of abandonment" workshop.
I've already skipped twice.
Wait till your father gets here.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.
If only we knew when he was about to arrive.
Hey!
How you doing, boy?
I'm glad to see you, too.
- How was your exam?
- Pretty routine.
- EKG?
- Perfect.
- Blood pressure?
- Textbook.
Full blood panel?
I told them to take two - they're small.
Oh, let's give a look.
Oh, look at this!
A nice big Band-Aid!
Nice try.
What'd you do that for?
Dr Jennings' office said you hadn't shown up today.
Why do you avoid the doctor?
Because I feel fine.
And I don't like Dr Jennings.
He's got a model of a colon on his desk.
He keeps his tongue depressors in it.
All right, Dad.
Why don't you see my doctor?
- She's one of the finest in Seattle.
- She?
No, no, no way.
If a doctor's going to have me bend over, I want to look through my legs and see wing tips.
Women have been poked and prodded by male doctors for centuries.
I say it's high time you gents went to a woman doctor.
See how you like waiting all naked and helpless and goose-bumpy.
Niles, recommend someone.
Niles!
I'm sorry, my mind was somewhere else.
Oh, I know who you should see!
Dr Gary Newman!
He's very successful.
I saw a Lichtenstein hanging in his office.
A Lichtenstein?
He sounds perfect.
OK.
I'll make an appointment.
Just hang on a second.
I will escort you personally.
- Wonderful, I can't wait.
- Stop grumbling.
It won't be so bad.
Unless you have to parade around the office in one of those gowns where your bum peaks through.
What's Dr Newman's number?
Niles Niles!
Sorry, I must have drifted off again.
My appointment was meant to be half an hour ago.
Let's get out of here.
Relax.
Read a magazine.
Here, take the Cosmo quiz.
"Are your nipples sensitive"?
Do it quietly.
It's not an oral exam.
You haven't seen the second question.
Did you keep your patients waiting?
Just the compulsives.
It was part of their therapy.
Relax, I'll take care of it.
My father had an appointment The doctor's running late.
You'll be first when he gets in.
Where's he coming from, Spokane?
From Lake Chelan.
Lake Chelan?
Ooh!
This guy must be terrific.
- So?
- He'll be here any minute.
I was just struck by one of life's little ironies, I remember you taking me to the doctor and here I am taking you.
Like when I took you for your first tetanus shot.
I was scared.
I remember you holding my hand.
You bent over, dropped your drawers.
You took your mind off the shot by reciting the names of Puccini's operas.
Right then, I knew you'd never be a cop.
I'm serious, let's go!
I'll check if there's someone substituting for him.
What are you here for?
Oh, lately, I've been having this overall sluggish feeling.
It's hard even getting out of bed, not to mention the cold weather.
It's really making my joints hurt.
I've started to notice flaking spots on my skin.
What about you?
I have sensitive nipples.
The doctor won't be able to make your appointment today.
Great!
These big shot doctors keep you waiting for an hour and then they don't even show up.
Played a little slow on the golf course?
Arrogant JERK!
Dad, Dad, Dad.
Dr Newman is dead.
He died an hour ago.
I'm sure he was a good man.
He walks down his walkway, he picks up his newspaper, and BANG, he drops dead of a heart attack.
I pick up my newspaper every day, and "The Sunday Times" is very heavy.
Well, these things happen.
How can you say that?
He wasn't old!
He was my age!
What can I say?
I don't think about these things like you do.
Maybe it's because you're 41 and I'm not.
Don't you ever think about dying?
Well, not me dying.
But you know what I have thought of lately?
I've been dating this older guy and what if You know We were in bed and he dropped dead?
It's a possibility.
Sometimes he starts breathing funny.
I don't know if he's having a good time or if I've overexcited him.
Someone has a very high opinion of herself.
Everybody's good at something.
Why is it that every time we talk, we end up talking about your sex life?
Because I have one.
Thank you for coming.
- Hello.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
I was in the middle of my workout, but I can always pump iron later.
I'll just fix us a snack.
"Pump iron"  Niles, you don't even pump your own gas.
All right.
What's this about getting your affairs in order?
Dr Newman dying so young threw me for a loop.
I realised I hadn't made the proper provisions for my own death.
Here we go.
- Allow me.
- Thanks.
I've prepared copies for you, the location and numbers of my bank accounts, my safety deposit keys, the number for my attorney Niles, what are you doing?
Oh, give me that!
I loosened it for him.
Now, my personal possessions.
This is for family only.
Please stay.
I'll come to you later.
Dad, Niles, put your names on these stickers and place them on the objects you would like bequeathed to you.
I'm not putting my name on your stuff!
What if I die tomorrow?
You will argue over that African mask.
It'll never happen.
Niles, you can have it.
I don't want it.
Don't look at me.
I throw a towel over it when you're not home.
OK, fine.
Well, now we come to the issue of my remains.
- Oh, jeez!
- It's all here in this easy-to-read binder.
This is taking it too far!
Look at this!
Burial Casket Caterers?
- Who are you using?
- Michaelson's.
They're very good.
- Bowtie pasta - And the asparagus tips Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Are we done?
There is just one more duck to put in the row.
I've discovered that most unexpected deaths occur in the home.
Daphne, this is where you come in, the actual finding of the body.
Oh, save the best part for me, eh?
That's all right.
As a health-care provider, I've had my share of patients die on me.
That's a comfort.
Maybe we should drop the subject.
This has made me feel better.
I can handle my mortality better now.
Enough about death!
Let's celebrate life with this Chateau Certan '75!
No, not the '75.
That's too good for the likes of us.
Perhaps a Beaujolais Nouveau would be more appropriate.
Eddie?
Oh, there you are.
Come on, boy.
Frasier, what are you still doing up?
Frasier!
Dad, please, shh.
I'm trying to listen to my heartbeat.
It's amazing, it can pump 1,800 gallons of blood each and every day but just a tiny tear in the tiniest artery, and poof you're gone.
I thought you were OK about this.
So did I. What is the matter with me?
I thought that putting my affairs in order would help me to deal with this, but it hasn't.
I can't seem to get over the feeling that something could happen to me.
Jeez, I'd miss so much.
I'd never get to see my son hit his first home run.
That'd be a terrible thing for a father to miss.
Tell me about it.
Look, let me tell you something.
There was this time, a while back, seven or eight of us were on this drug bust.
We went through the front door and the first guy took one, he died.
When you're a cop, you've got to handle things like that, but I just couldn't get over it.
Every time I had to go in a dark building, I froze.
I knew if I kept being afraid, I'd never be able to do my job.
- So what did you do?
- I forced myself to forget it.
Next time I came to one of those doors, I went right through it!
The fact that I got shot in the hip was purely coincidental.
You were this close to helping me.
Just because some doctor dies doesn't mean you will.
Yeah, but he was just like me, highly educated, sophisticated.
I saw his picture in a medical journal.
He even looked like me.
Same determined chin, sweater vest, ever so slightly receding hairline.
You don't know his medical history.
Actually, you're onto something there, Dad.
Yeah He could've had high blood pressure, popped pills, drank like a fish.
Yeah, could be anything.
I'll find out what caused his heart attack.
Then I can disassociate myself from him.
There must be some explanation.
That's great, Dad.
I feel better now.
You've got something on your bathrobe.
"Niles".
The vultures are circling.
Come on, Eddie.
Hello.
I called earlier.
Someone said Mrs Newman would be here.
Please, come in.
I'm Allen Freedman.
Gary was my cousin.
Dr Frasier Crane.
My condolences.
I didn't know Mrs Newman had company.
- It's shivah.
- Excuse me?
It's the Jewish version of a wake.
Oh, yes, of course.
- I didn't realise Gary was Jewish.
- You're kidding?
We did spend a lot of time together.
Never on Friday nights, of course.
This is a bad time.
Jill would love to know you came.
She's right over there.
- She looks busy.
Well, I can wait.
- Will you excuse me?
May I help you?
Oh, this is a mirror.
I thought maybe you were having an unveiling later.
You're not Jewish, are you?
No, no, my ex-wife is, though, and thus my son is, which makes me sort of, well No, I'm not Jewish.
We always cover mirrors at a shivah so those grieving don't have to be concerned with their appearances.
Well, you look very nice.
Oh, thank you.
It's been driving me crazy.
- I'm Bobbie, Gary's aunt.
- Dr Frasier Crane.
My sympathies.
The doctor with the radio show?
- Did you know Gary well?
- Oh, well.
Yes, I did.
There was so much more I wanted to know about the man.
I don't know Eh How was his health before he died?
- Excellent, he was never sick.
- Heart disease?
- High blood pressure or cholesterol?
- No.
I'm sorry, I'm asking too many questions.
We doctors are always looking for the answers.
- Oh, Gail!
- Aunt Bobbie!
I know, I know.
I'd like you to meet a friend of Gary's, Dr Frasier Crane.
Dr Crane?
From the radio?
Yes.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I love your show!
Oh, I'm sorry.
When I went to pick up this Linzer torte, I thought of Gary and So Gary liked fattening desserts?
Oh, no.
If he knew I brought this here, he'd kill me.
Gary was a health fanatic.
A vegetarian.
We played basketball every Sunday.
So he was sedentary all week and then burning up the court on Sundays?
No, he played four times a week if he wasn't at the gym working out.
- Gary was in phenomenal shape.
- Didn't smoke, never touched coffee.
My goodness, has anybody checked to see if he's really dead?
I'm I'm sure they did check.
Those people are very thorough.
Oh, my, is that Kugel?
Excuse me.
Mrs Newman.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
I was a friend of your husband's.
- Dr Crane!
From - Yes, the radio.
- Gary never mentioned you.
- Well, we weren't actually friends.
He had an office in my brother's building.
You took the time to come here!
His own partner stayed only 15 minutes.
Well, there is a reason I came to talk to you.
- Which is?
- It's about Gary.
- About how he - Yes?
I'm sorry I bothered you.
I just came to offer my sympathies.
No, wait, um Dr Crane I listen to you all the time and Well, maybe you could help me.
What would you tell someone who called in and said they can't get over why someone died?
I keep running this over and over in my mind and I just can't understand how someone like Gary, who did everything right, can just die.
I can't make any sense of it.
Mrs Newman I know you'd like me to come up with an answer to this whole thing, but I don't have one.
Someone who consumes cigarettes and burgers can live to be 83 and then someone who takes care of himself can die at 41.
It's unfair.
Well, there's no explanation for it.
Believe me, I've checked.
But I suppose the best we can do is live for the little joys and surprises that life affords us.
You can't spend your life being obsessed with death.
You're not Jewish, are you?
No, I'm not, but Well, thank you for letting me be here today.
Thank you for coming, Dr Crane.
Oh, Dr Crane!
It was very nice what you said about living life for the little joys and surprises it can give us.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- If only I believed it myself.
- Excuse me.
Um, this is clearly the most inappropriate thing I've ever done in my life, but I was watching you and I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to see you again and something about you tells me I'd like to.
If you'd like to get together sometime, give me a call.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I wish you all the very best of holidays.
Like many, I'll spend the time in the loving embrace of my family, which should give us plenty to talk about in the new year.
Meantime, this is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 talk radio.
Come on.
There's a gin and tonic out there with my name on it.
Father Mike's trying to get everyone to re-enact the Nativity scene.
We know who can play the ass.
- I'm wearing her down.
Who's that for?
- It's for Roz.
"Amazing trick microphone.
Squirts water".
Nice.
It's a gag.
We don't exchange gifts.
I'm scheduled to do the noon-to-four slot at Christmas.
Nope.
But my family is getting together after five years.
- I don't care.
- But my sister and her new baby Bulldog, my son Frederick is flying in to spend the holidays with me.
I have never looked so forward to a Christmas since I was your size.
-  Did you tell him?
- Don't yell.
- You're not giving a traffic report.
- I yelled?
Hey, Doc, you know Bonnie Weems?
I don't, but she does the auto show, right?
Bonnie drinks more than she should at these parties, so the newest on-air personality drives her home.
- That's you.
- I'd be delighted to drive her home.
She'll be delighted.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Dr Crane.
- Oh, merry Christmas, Elizabeth.
I baked you sugar cookies.
Oh, sweets from the sweet.
Do you know who's driving Bonnie Weems home tonight?
Yes, I am.
Can you tell me why?
Hey, everybody, it's the doc!
Roz, why does everyone break into hysterics when I say I'm driving Bonnie Weems home?
What is that?
Bonnie Weems is kind of an office legend.
After a few drinks, she gets amorous and won't take no for an answer.
Is that all?
I'm a big boy.
- I can take care of myself.
- OK!
I know we promised not to, but I was out shopping Oh, no.
Don't worry.
I couldn't help myself, either.
Oh, no, really?
Great.
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, Roz, you shouldn't have.
- Open yours.
- This is just Oh, Roz, you really shouldn't have.
- Now it's my turn.
- Oh, don't.
Maybe you should keep it under the tree.
Me wait to open a Christmas present?
Yeah, right.
Oh, my God, it's great!
It's great because I'm in radio.
- That's what I was going for.
- Thanks a million, Frasier.
Have a happy holiday and I'll see you next week.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Dr Crane?
I'm Bonnie Weems.
Hello.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'll drive you home tonight.
- I'm sorry to put you out.
- No problem.
Enjoy the party.
Tell me when you're ready to go.
I'm ready now, baby!
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.
Merry Christmas.
To what do I owe this occasion?
Nothing.
I just stopped by to get an opinion on a gift for Maris.
It pinches a bit under the arms, but you be the judge.
Oh, hello, Dr Crane.
Daphne.
Shall I put the little red one back on so you can make your choice?
- Niles has all the information he needs.
- Fair enough.
Maris and Daphne are roughly the same size.
Give or take a foot.
Frasier, where you been?
After the Christmas party, I poured a colleague into a cab, said a quick prayer for the driver, dislodged the wedgie of a lifetime then I did some shopping.
Niles, sherry?
- Thank you.
- Santa's going to be good to Frederick.
Bulldog called.
He wants you to take his slot on Christmas.
I've already told him no.
How long will that man nag me?
- What are you doing?
- I'll hang it on the door.
- It's plastic!
- Of course it is.
You think a real one would have lasted since 1967?
Here you go.
I'm glad to be out of that black one.
I had to take me undies off to zip it up.
Oh, let me get that.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
- Frasier, for you.
It's the nag.
- Oh, Lord.
Bulldog, I already told you that Oh Oh, hello, Lilith.
No, maybe I should, uh I'll take this in the bedroom.
Everything set for tomorrow?
Yes, Maris and I drive to the cabin tonight.
We'll expect you tomorrow around noon.
- I wish I was coming with you.
- So do I.  Oh, shut the hell up, will you?
Daphne, you should come.
We have a traditional Christmas.
It's an actual log cabin with actual deer grazing in our yard.
Maris fires her gun to scare them away from our garbage, but still it's enchanting.
You can't come?
No, I'll be in San Francisco with my uncle.
I guess you should be with your family.
It's more traditional.
Except that Jackie is a transvestite.
Getting a bit long in the tooth for it, too, if you ask me.
Thanksgiving, he ate too much turkey, and I had to cut him out of his pantyhose.
Merry Christmas, everybody?
!
- Lilith isn't sending Frederick.
- Why not?
He has this "unique" opportunity for an "incredible" Christmas.
Her friend has rented a home in Austria.
- Why not the USA?
- They filmed "The Sound Of Music" in the house, Freddie's favourite movie.
Julie Andrews is singing there.
They're having dinner with her afterwards.
There's some nonsense about a horse-driven sleigh ride and a balloon trip.
Oh, and they're going to spend an entire day at Euro Disneyland.
At the cabin, there's an old stump that the local children enjoy kicking.
- You have to let him go.
- Of course I have to let him go.
- Thank God you know what's right.
- I was just making sure you did.
- How would I live without you?
- Now, now.
That's enough.
You're being a good father letting him go.
It need not ruin your Christmas.
Come on, let's finish decorating the tree.
I got the lights from the storeroom.
Dad, I don't want to use those this year.
I picked up these yesterday.
Chilli peppers?
- They're very fashionable.
- But chilli peppers aren't Christmas!
Neither are Scotch pines or snow ornaments.
If you want to be technical - Bethlehem was in the desert.
- Why don't we decorate a palm tree?
- No need for sarcasm!
- I always use those lights!
- Dad This is my house!
Can I have one thing the way I want it?
You're upset, but don't take it out on me.
- Fine.
Now you're the psychiatrist?
- I give up.
- Use your chillies!
- Oh, I don't want them any more!
No, go ahead.
We could hang radishes!
Put a nice broccoli on top!
- Don't behave this way at the cabin.
- We won't.
I'm not going to the cabin!
- Where are you going?
- I'm staying.
- You can't.
- I'll fill in for Bulldog.
- Well, merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
I didn't realise that working on Christmas would ruin your plans.
- Please don't be mad.
- What for?
My mother flew in from Wisconsin to be with me today.
Instead, I'm in this stinking hellhole on Christmas day, when only the loneliest most depressed people would call in!
But look how nice you look for me?
!
Try to see it from my position.
I couldn't see my son.
I had a fight with my father.
Then I thought, helping others through their troubles, may get me through mine.
If we try hard, we can maybe have the best Christmas we've ever had.
- What do you say?
- OK, I'm not mad.
Get ready.
- I need a hug to prove we're friends.
- I am not hugging you, you're grungy.
- Come to Papa.
Hug, hug, hug, hug!
- All right!
Yuck, we're friends.
Now, get ready, you're on.
Merry Christmas, Seattle!
This is Dr Crane coming to you on Christmas Day.
Christmas, that very magical time of the year when each moment is as unique as a snowflake never to be recreated.
Sorry.
The news went over.
Do that again.
Merry Christmas, Seattle!
As we head into our second hour, I'd like to lighten things up a bit.
Ned's told us how he got mugged on his way home from the soup kitchen.
- Who's next?
- Don wants to tell us about a time when he was filled with Christmas spirit.
- It's about time.
Hello, Don!
-  'Hello.
'I learned yesterday why this is called "the season of giving".
' - Then swaddle me in Christmas cheer.
- 'OK.
I was driving home.
'I realised, I'd left my favourite pair of sneakers on the roof of the car.
'I looked back and saw this homeless guy.
He was already putting them on.
'So I just thought, "What the hell"?
And I kept driving.
' So your experience of the Christmas spirit would be that you didn't slam the car into reverse, speed back there, and rip your smelly old sneakers out of a homeless man's hands.
Well, Roz, I think we got Santa Claus himself on the line?
!
'I'm sorry.
That was the last time.
I'm OK now, I'm really OK.
'No, I'm not!
' Barry, I've got to put you on hold while you pull yourself together.
But stay on the line, I'd like to help you.
'Lt's all right.
I think I've got a hold of myself.
'No, I don't!
'  'I've fallen in the shower so many times, 'they can't fit any more pins in my hip.
' Gladys, listen, can I put you on hold for a second?
I have to check on somebody.
How's it going there, Barry?
My sentiments exactly.
'Lt still traumatises me, Dr. Crane.
'I wake up, and I remember that Christmas morning.
'I walked into my mother's bedroom crying, and I said, "Mommy"!
"'The puppy Santa gave me won't wake up".
' OK, Tom.
You win the prize for the saddest Christmas story we've heard.
Happy holidays.
Roz!
Roz!
Oh, have you been crying?
Just for the last hour.
Oh, why don't you go home?
I can take over for the next two hours.
- You can't do this.
- Just go home, be with your mom.
Won't it be sadder here all by yourself?
I don't think that's possible.
Well, if you really mean it, I'll go.
I mean it.
But promise me one thing.
Don't sit here and get more depressed.
- You'll see your boy again soon.
- I know.
OK.
Hug, hug, hug?
Merry Christmas!
Hi, we're back.
I realise it has been a pretty tough day for most of you.
I'd like to hear from someone who's having a good Christmas.
Someone who has maybe learned a way to beat the holiday blues.
How about it?
Let's take our first call here.
Hello, you're on the air.
'Hello, Dr Crane.
This is Jeff.
' - Merry Christmas!
- 'Same to you.
'I used to get depressed on Christmas.
Then I found a way to beat it.
'I pop my favourite movie, "The Sound Of Music", in the VCR.
'Watching Julie Andrews lead those adorable little tykes through Salzburg, 'nobody could be depressed.
I mean nobody!
' Jeff, are you a betting man?
We're just about out of time.
My, my, this day has flown by.
I wish all of you happy revellers out there a merry Christmas, and the others: Go out and treat yourself to something special.
Personally, I'll get myself a meal at one of Seattle's fine eateries.
I don't know where, but I promise you one thing it'll have a liquor licence.
Just kidding.
Don't drink and drive.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 talk radio.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Welcome to "Lou's".
Thank you.
I'm glad you're open.
All other places are closed or booked up.
That makes us so special.
Almost everybody's having the Christmas platter.
That's a turkey log with mashed potatoes then Yule log for dessert.
How much more appetising food becomes when you add the word "log".
I'll just have the Christmas platter.
Platter!
- How you doing?
- OK.
- You having a merry Christmas?
- Now that you ask, no, I'm not.
Can't be with my son, had an argument over something stupid with my father.
- That's why I'm alone.
- Oh.
And you?
Pretty good.
Just yesterday, I was crossing the street, and this beautiful pair of sneakers flew off a car and landed on my feet.
Merry Christmas!
Here you go.
The chef didn't exactly dally over the remoulade, did he?
Hey, Tim, merry Christmas!
Hey, Bill, glad you could make it.
Hey, how's that turkey platter?
Good as last year's?
I'm not sure this isn't last year's.
- Huh?
- I'm done.
Please take this seat.
- Oh, jeez, thanks, pal.
- You bet.
Excuse me.
Something embarrassing happened.
I seem to have lost my wallet.
- You can't pay?
- Oh, no.
I can pay.
I must have left it at the office.
I can just go and get it.
- Mm-hm.
- It's all right.
This one's on me.
You don't understand, I - It's OK, we've all been there.
- But I really did misplace my wallet.
I know you did and Bill here misplaced his Wall Street portfolio.
- Here, Bill, help me out.
- Oh, no, no.
Hey, everybody, let's help a poor man get a nice Christmas dinner.
Come on.
- No, please.
You don't understand.
- It doesn't matter, even pennies.
I make a very decent living, I really do.
This is not necessary.
Well, I I must say I've never been so touched in my life.
To think that you would give up your money which you can ill afford to help out a fellow human being.
- There you go.
- Gee, I'm so embarrassed.
Look at it this way.
The rest of the year belongs to the rich with their fancy houses, expensive foreign cars.
But Christmas - Christmas belongs to guys like us.
- Right.
I never will forget this Christmas.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thanks.
Hey!
Somebody lose a set of car keys?
Hey, we're not buying you dessert.
No, you see, I forgot, uh - What?
- Uh To wish you a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
- Hey, bud!
Since you're here, go call your old man.
Thank you.
I think I will.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # Maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Though washing one's hands 20 to 30 times a day IS obsessive-compulsive, please bear in mind that your husband is a coroner.
Thank you for your call.
Roz, whom do we have next?
Ethan is having a problem at school.
- Hello, Ethan.
I'm listening.
- 'Hi, Dr Crane.
' - How old are you?
- 'I'm 13.
'I'm having problems with the other kids.
They're always beating me up.
' Why do you think that's so?
'Because I'm smart.
I have a 160 IQ.
'I'm in the astronomy club and I hate sports.
' Well, the other children are just acting out of jealousy and immaturity.
I know it doesn't help much now but the day will come when you will have the last laugh.
'That's it?
' Yes.
'I find that advice patronising, simplistic and uninspired.
'The real surprise here is they pay you to dole out this balloon juice.
' - Ethan, where are you calling from?
- 'Home.
' If any of Ethan's classmates are listening you know where he is, and he can't stay there forever.
Thank you for your call.
That's about it for today.
This is Frasier Crane KACL talk radio, 780AM.
- That was a pretty good show, eh?
- Sure, whatever you say.
- Got another one of your hot dates?
- If you must know, yes.
- Pick you up outside in five minutes?
- Great.
Thanks, Noel.
Noel?
Noel Shemsky from Sales?
That's who your date is with?
We're just having a drink.
Noel, the Mole?
I know he's not great-looking, I know he drives a '73 Dodge Polaris, but he's always struck me as a really interesting guy.
The world's full of superficial guys.
He's got a good heart, he's smart, he's substantial, and considering my track record lately, I'd expect your support.
Does Noel still have that autographed picture of Captain Kirk in his cubicle?
Why do I tell you anything?
Knock, knock!
Can I be of any assistance?
Oh, no thank you.
I have everything under control.
Mind if I linger?
I've always been sort of a kitchen person.
Suit yourself.
I like the company.
So how is Dad's therapy going?
We can see more mobility in his hip and his flexibility is improving, but it's a chore to get him to do his exercises.
But if I bribe him with sweets Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Dr Crane!
Dr Crane, can you get up?
No, I'll stay here for a few minutes.
Niles, what are you doing?
- He conked his head on the hood.
- You are shameless!
I have a sore head and a crackerjack lawyer, so don't crowd me.
- Here, put this on it.
- You've been wonderful in this crisis.
Oh, come on, Camille.
I need to talk to you.
I'm having a young lady over on Friday.
- Could you take Dad out?
- I wish you'd said Saturday.
You have plans Friday?
- No, I have plans Saturday.
Please.
Oh, all right.
So, does this mean you're hoping to get lucky?
Please, nobody refers to having sex as "getting lucky" any more.
I do.
- Hello, boys.
-  Hi, Dad.
Would you like to join Maris and me Friday night?
We're dying to try the new rib joint on Bellevue Way.
If the onion rings aren't as big as your head, you get them for free.
Thanks, but I thought I'd just spend a quiet evening at home.
Oh, well Why don't you come to our house?
We'll make dinner and we'll even rent an Angie Dickinson film.
What's going on?
Frasier wants me out of here because he's got a date?
I'm sorry, he sees things that others don't.
I should have asked you myself.
I'll clear out, but remember, one hand washes the other around here.
- What does that mean?
- You can clear out for me Thursday.
I got a date with Elaine in 1412.
How long has this been going on?
She's had me over for coffee.
I'd like to have her over for dinner.
Niles, wipe that stupid smirk off your face.
- What do you say?
- Terrific.
If there's a lull in the conversation we've got board games, playing cards.
Does she play Canasta?
And PBS has a documentary on the swing bands of the '30s and '40s.
Thanks, boys.
We'll have creamed corn, rub liniment into each other's joints and fall asleep drooling on the couch.
Morning, Daphne.
Morning.
I want to thank you again for the show last night.
I've never been to experimental theatre before.
What did it mean when the naked man came in carrying the suitcase?
Well, I think it meant that he packed too much.
I'm sure your father was glad to have us out.
What is that heavenly aroma?
Traditional English breakfast.
We have eggs and bangers, or sausages, and a batch of Grammy Moon's famous sticky buns.
Oh, my, that's it!
Grammy used to add a pint of rum to the recipe and nobody liked these more than Grammy.
I'd go to her house and find her out in the garden in a wedding dress face down in the birdbath.
- Morning!
- Morning, Dad.
So how was your date last night?
It feels strange, a son asking his father how his date was last night when he could ask the date herself.
Elaine, this is Daphne, my son Frasier.
This is Elaine Morris.
- Yes, hello.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
I know Dad's wanted to have you for a long time.
I mean for dinner.
Well, I certainly enjoyed it.
But I should be going.
No, you should at least stay for breakfast.
I could stay for coffee.
Splendid, splendid.
What did you two kids do last night?
Did you play some games?
I mean, board games.
Not that you were bored or excited.
Well Not that I'd know anything or should, but Warm buns, Elaine.
No, not yours.
I mean, ours, to eat.
Here, I'll have one.
Mmm Warm.
- Let's go sit at the table.
- OK.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't know!
Frasier, I love your show.
My friends and I listen to it almost every day.
That's always lovely to hear.
- Elaine's a buyer at Bon Marché.
- I do a great deal of shopping there.
I bought the comforter on Dad's bed.
I suppose you noticed that.
Well I don't know if you had the lights on or I don't know how you like it.
I mean, well, how you light it.
Well, how you like to light it.
Oh, banger, Dad?
I really should be going.
I've got to get ready for work.
It was nice meeting you, Daphne, and, uh, Frasier.
- Thanks for a lovely evening, Martin.
- I'll call you later.
You couldn't have served bacon?
Me?
The way you were carrying on we can be thankful I didn't make toad in the hole.
You handled that smoothly, Dr Crane.
I'm sorry, Dad.
It just caught me off guard.
Oh, that's OK, I should have warned you, but But I really didn't think it was going to happen.
Pretty glad it did.
- So you like Elaine?
- I like Elaine.
- So, Dad?
- Yeah, yeah.
You're back on the beat!
All right!
- Lock up your daughters!
- Yeah, OK.
- Oh, come on, you old - Frasier, don't push it!
We have Marianne on line 4, she's concerned about her daughter.
Hello, Marianne.
I'm listening.
'Kids, you can't live with them, 'you can't shove them back in the womb.
' Well, as we try to forget the image that summons up how can I help you?
'My 22-year-old arrived home for a visit with her boyfriend.
'I insisted they sleep in separate bedrooms.
'She got furious.
She's been upset with me all week.
Am I out of line here?
' - In your house you make up the rules.
- 'Thank you.
' But isn't there something else here?
Perhaps you find it hard to think of your daughter as an adult.
We all freeze people in roles with which we are most comfortable, especially when it comes to that old bugaboo, sex.
Take me as an example.
My 63-year-old father moved in with me and this morning, over coffee, I discovered he had spent the night with a delightful creature named Elaine.
It completely unnerved me as I had never thought of my father as a man with normal sexual urges.
To me, he was always just "Dad".
Well, that's absurd.
He is a witty, virile, charming man, possessed with the hereditary Crane good looks.
What I'm driving at is that sexuality is a healthy part of adulthood at any age.
It's time we embraced that, right?
'Sorry, I've got to go.
I'm hearing noises from the guest room.
' As Marianne rushes to the guest room with a bucket of ice water, we will pause for these messages.
- That was a good show.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Dr Crane.
Hi, Roz.
- Hi, Noel.
- I had a great time last night.
- Me, too.
I made you this spice rack.
I specially treated the back for easy wall adhesion.
That was very thoughtful of you, Noel.
Well, um I got to run.
I'll call you later.
Live long and prosper.
Oh, look, there's a place for cumin.
Most people overlook that.
Just kill me.
Why would he say it on the radio?
When you get angry, your ears turn red.
See, there they go.
Good evening everyone.
I'll be going to me room right now.
Hello, Eddie.
- I seem to have cleared the room.
- I want to talk to you, mister.
And take me out behind the woodshed?
Why were you talking about my personal life on your programme?
- You mean about you and Elaine?
- Damn right!
I was so embarrassed!
It was flattering.
Yeah, telling Seattle about me shacking up with a neighbour.
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
Knock it off.
Elaine won't even talk to me any more.
What for?
Simply because of a harmless remark?
People of our generation think that sex is a private thing.
That's a healthy way of looking at it.
Sex is something between you and the person you're doing it to!
Don't you think she's overreacting a little?
She spends the night.
Next, it's being broadcast all over Seattle.
I mean, her friends heard it and called her.
She won't go out or answer the phone.
- I'm sorry.
- Your sympathy touches me  I caused the problem, so I'll take care of it.
I'll be in my room holding my breath.
I said I'd take care of it.
'I hate my voice.
'I know no one likes the sound of their own voice, especially on tape, 'it doesn't sound as good as in their own head.
'But I hate my voice in my head, too.
'You can't get away from your own voice.
'I tried not listening to myself when I talk, 'but then I say things that don't make a lot of sense.
'I hate my voice so much, 'I had to call a neighbour in to do the message on my answering machine.
'I don't like his voice much either but it's better than mine.
'Not that I get a lot of calls, anyway.
Go figure.
'Any advice, Dr Crane?
' Just go on with what you're doing and everything should turn out all right.
Thank you for your call.
Oh, I'd like to end today's show on something of a personal note.
I'm talking to one person in my audience.
Elaine.
You wouldn't answer my phone calls, so I hope you're listening.
I want to apologise for what I said on the radio.
I took something private and made it public.
I will never do that again, well, except for this time.
Then I promise I'll never do it again.
The saddest thing is, Elaine, Dad is paying for my mistake.
Elaine, Martin cares for you and he misses you very much.
More than anything, he'd like to be back together with you.
And if you feel the same, I hope you'll find it in your heart to come to my place tonight at 8:00 for dinner a very romantic dinner.
Thanks, Elaine.
This is KACL-780AM, talk radio, and I'm Frasier Crane The lo-ove doctor.
# Moon river # The champagne is chilled, a platter of hors d'oeuvres - The roast looks beautiful.
- I hope this works.
I've been sending Elaine psychic messages.
You can transmit?
I thought you were just a receiver.
I'm giving it a try.
You know: "Elaine in 1410, come to dinner, come to dinner".
That's very charming, but Elaine is in 1412.
I'd better set an extra place at the table, then.
- It's 8:00 and I'm still a pumpkin.
- It is two minutes to 8:00.
Relax.
She probably didn't hear your show.
- Does this tie go with the jacket?
- You look smashing.
Who am I kidding?
She won't show up.
Let's skip the first course, which is crow, and start with the hors d'oeuvres.
Just answer the door.
Is this the Crane residence?
- Yes, it is.
- We've been here for 15 minutes.
- Did Elaine show up or not?
- Who are you?
We heard your show, so romantic!
We all have our fingers crossed.
- That's kind.
- I'm Marjorie from 11, this is Norman, these other people I don't know.
Nice to see you all.
Tony, shouldn't you be watching the door?
We're all locked in.
I must find out how this ends, Doc.
- What's going on out here?
- Oh, is this Martin?
Oh!
People, don't you have lives of your own?
Please, scoot!
It's a private situation.
- That's her!
- Oh, my God!
- Please, come out.
- No!
Dad, you come in here.
OK, back off!
Just give us some time!
Please!
I should never have come up.
Nothing's changed.
- Let me explain.
- You've done enough.
- Frasier, over there.
- Dad - Turn around.
- Well, I Ah!
I'm sorry about what happened.
You've got every right to be mad.
What we had was pretty good.
And thanks to radio boy here, most of Seattle agrees with me.
I'd hate us to lose it because of one stupid thing.
Come on, Elaine.
I had a great time on our date.
Don't you feel the same way?
You may not remember but I have warm toes.
It's your choice, but I sure wish you'd come and have dinner with me.
Who said you could turn around?
Look, it's coming back up!
Oh!
All right, you've had your fun.
Show is over.
Go back to your homes.
Please folks.
Honour what the man says.
Thank you so much for your concern.
Let's expedite this departure, if you would.
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.
- We should give them their privacy.
- Yes, I suppose you're right.
It's ironic: My 63-year-old father is about to embark on a night of romance, while the two of us, a man and woman, both attractive and eligible, in the prime of our lives, with nothing to do on a Saturday night.
The answer to our problems might be right under our noses.
Yes, Daphne, I think it is.
All right, you go claim the washing machines.
I'll go get the laundry.
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused # Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those # Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face What is a boy to do?
# Thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
He calls himself a quarterback?
I've passed kidney stones more accurately.
Roz, could you get my briefcase?
I left it in the studio.
Why don't you go get it?
He always humiliates me on the air.
What do you think he does to me?
Last week, he introduced me as Martina Navratilova's girlfriend.
Chuck, I'm sorry I offended you.
Now, why don't you put your skirt back on and do some dishes?
The lines are open.
How about some real men calling in instead of crybabies like Chuck?
Ah!
Look who just crawled in: Dr Frasier Crane.
And you know what we do when we get a house call from the doctor.
'Drop your pants, bend over.
I take your temperature.
' Hello, Bulldog.
Who's your pick for the Giants/Saints game this weekend?
- The Giants.
- No.
- The Saints.
- No.
- Somebody has to win.
- If they were playing this weekend!
Very funny.
You should play it on my show.
It deserves to be heard by a larger audience.
Hee-haw!
Hee-haw!
Hello, Dr Crane.
- I brought this for dinner.
- Hey, Niles.
You're early.
I put Maris on the train to Chicago.
I am desolate without her.
Champagne?
It goes with all occasions.
- Can I assist you in the kitchen?
- No, I have everything well in hand.
Ah, well, lucky everything.
Mmm Uh-uh Uh-uh - What would you do?
- Take that corn nut off the board.
That's my bishop.
Eddie ate the real one.
In that case, corn nut to rook 7.
Hello, all.
Evening.
Your brother brought champagne!
Oh, Maris left for Chicago already?
She's riding the rails as we speak.
Why doesn't she fly instead?
She's been afraid to fly since her harrowing incident.
Did her plane almost crash?
No, she was bumped from first class.
She still wakes up screaming.
- Frasier, I got a favour to ask you.
- What is it?
A buddy of mine is running the Widows and Orphans Fund benefit, and he needs some local celebrities for his bachelor auction.
If we could get somebody really famous from the radio station - I'd be delighted to help.
- So you'll ask Bulldog?
- Bulldog?
- Oh, well, you know I Well, I mean Don't get me wrong, I was going to ask you, too.
- I was just saving the best for last.
- Uh-huh.
If he back-pedals any faster, he'll trip over his walker.
All right, I'll do it.
I really appreciate it.
- You won't forget to ask Bulldog?
- I'll leave a note on his hydrant.
Oh, a bachelor auction.
It'd be fun to pick a man off the block to do my bidding and fulfil my every desire.
- Doctor Crane?
- I'd love to.
I mean I Uh Frasier?
What if no one bids?
What if you're left standing there with flop sweat trickling down your back amidst a great gaping silence?
- It'll never happen.
- Thank you, Dad.
Yeah, we got a band.
Our next bachelor on the block is public TV's own cute and cuddly Mr Science!
God, the oestrogen level is off the charts out there.
Yeah, isn't it great!
Deep down, chicks are just like guys - we all want the same thing.
Frasier Crane does not put out.
All they're getting is a gourmet meal - and a handshake at the door.
- Boring!
My date gets a stretch limo, dinner, floor seats at the Sonics game, and these incredible buns of steel.
Feel them, Doc.
C'mon, feel them!
Thank you, no.
Ladies, keep your articles of clothing off the stage.
Show these women celebrity beefcake and they go nutso!
Typical mob mentality.
I hope the fire exits are clearly marked.
Relax, will you?
You're not the one jumping into the Rottweiler pit carrying a pork chop.
Hey, That's T.J. Smith he's a linebacker for the Seahawks!
They call him "The Enforcer".
He's put two quarterbacks in hospital.
T.J., Marty Crane!
- Number 19?
- Please don't make me go out there.
Oh You'll be fine.
Just go on out there and have a good time.
They're gonna have him for breakfast.
How was it?
They're like sharks in a feeding frenzy.
The one who bought me looked crazed.
Where do I pay?
- Roz!
- I saw what I wanted and I went after it.
Stay!
Number 20?
- That's me.
- I really appreciate this.
Having somebody like you in the auction really adds class.
If the bidding gets slow, drop a quarter and take a couple of minutes to pick it up, huh?
Sold!
To that determined lady in the back row for $500!
- So, Doc, who bought you?
- No idea.
The last thing I remember is someone shouting out: "Shake your money maker"!
- Number 21.
- Ladies, start your engines!
Doctor Crane?
Kristina Harper.
I just bought you.
You bought me?
Yeah.
I listen to your show.
I'm a big fan of yours.
Well, how wonderful.
You bought me for $500.
That's a lot of money.
I did a layout for "Seattle Style".
- Are you a photographer?
- No, I'm a model.
A model!
How wonderful!
For you How about Friday?
OK.
I live at the Elliot Bay Towers.
Around seven?
- Sounds great.
See you then.
- Bye.
That's my new owner.
She's a model.
No kidding.
She almost put my eye out.
You're back quick.
I was one of the last guys.
The money was running low.
But there was still one rawhide chew-toy out there for the Bulldog.
I got to take a squirt.
When I come back, we'll play fetch.
My God!
Daphne, why?
Things were slow, so your father asked me to shill.
I opened at $100.
Who knew that would be the only bid?
Whoosh!
Kristina.
Buonanotte.
Sorry I'm late but I got a call for a job.
OK.
You're here now.
No, the job's tonight, but we could have dinner later.
All right.
I hope you didn't go to too much trouble.
Oh, no!
- You rented a restaurant trolley.
- No, I own it.
You don't have one?
One more thing.
My friend Sandy got called in on the same job and she was supposed to look after my daughter.
Don't tell me you want me to baby-sit.
Sandy will take her when I get back and that'll leave just the two of us.
Kristina, I'm not really sure if I can - I'll make points for this, won't I?
- A ton.
Bring the darling in.
- This is my daughter Renata.
- Hello.
She's shy at first.
Oh, there's the elevator.
See you later.
Well, come on in.
Have a seat.
Can I get you, uh a soft drink?
Goose liver paté?
"Renata" that's a pretty name.
It must have Can I use your phone?
We're spending the evening together.
Let's make the best of it.
I may surprise you.
I probably am more "with it" than you think I am.
The phone's right there.
No way!
No way!
That is so fresh.
No way!
No way!
No way!
Hold on, there's another call.
Hello?
He'll call you back.
- No way!
- Who was that?
I don't know.
No way!
- Another call's coming in.
- I'll take this one.
Hello?
It's for you.
Hello?
Hey, Tiffany.
Tiffany!
You just spoke to Tiffany!
That was Tiffany Schwartz.
This is Tiffany Martinez.
I celebrate the ethnic mosaic that is America, but nonetheless What's your damage?
You've been on the phone for 11/2 hours.
You haven't spoken to me except to ask for more Cheetos!
They're coming, Eddie!
I'm supposed to be happy I'm here?
Her fabulousness dumps me here with a total stranger who could be a perv.
I'm not thrilled about it either.
And I am not a perv.
You don't get it.
She's always doing this.
She's a flake.
Flake or not, you are in my charge.
You should have something nutritious.
Now, how about seafood crepes?
Lobster Newburg?
Corndog dipped in curare?
- Have you got any raw cookie dough?
- Even more lethal.
Let's see.
You wouldn't have gotten anywhere with this gourmet meal routine.
She eats nothing.
She's a total diet freak.
And she only talks about herself.
- You don't care much for your mother?
- Well, duh  I hate to think that when my son's your age, he'll think of me as a - Dweeb?
- Thank you.
Brace yourself.
Oh, well, look what we have here.
Will one tube suffice?
- Cool.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Renata, you know I am a psychiatrist.
And if you're having problems with your mother, I'd be glad to listen.
You want me to tell you my problems like those gomers on your show?
- Like you care  - I do care about the gomers.
- I even care about you.
- Don't make me hurl.
- She tells people I'm younger.
- Why do you think she does that?
So they won't know how old SHE is.
- I've been nine for three years.
- Really?
Once she promised to take me ice-skating.
On the way there, she saw a tattoo parlour.
She left me outside to get a butterfly tattooed on her shoulder.
- She forgot I was out there.
- How old were you?
That was the FIRST time I was nine.
What does your father say about this?
Tony?
He's on the road with Whitesnake all the time.
- Is that a musical group or a pet?
- It's his new wife.
I was apprehensive about going out with you tonight, but I'm having a jolly time unless it's the champagne getting to me.
I have had quite a bit, haven't I?
Oh, who cares?
That's the beauty of being in a limo unless the driver's drinking.
You're not drinking, are you?
He's not drinking.
- Let's drink to the driver not drinking!
- Man, you're really looped Great!
It certainly is taking a long time getting out of this parking lot.
Did I say this was my first basketball game?
I did, four times.
I still can't get over those players.
They're positively gigantic.
Not that being tall is the only measure of a man but it's a bloody good one!
Oh, dear, I just insulted you, didn't I?
Sorry.
Oh, well, you can take it.
You're a tough little nut.
Oh, dear This is not good, not good at all.
- You don't like the champagne?
- No, I can see the bottom of my glass!
Well, bottoms up!
You are a naughty boy.
Don't go getting any ideas.
Oh, look who I'm saying this to.
You don't have an idea in your head.
Oh!
I did it again.
I insulted you.
Let's drink to that.
Boom!
Now, that is downright rude!
Hey, you there!
You in the Firebird!
Yes, you, stop that honking!
Just because you look stupid doesn't mean you have to act stupid!
Don't aggravate him!
Tosh!
Civilisation won't progress unless someone points out when people's manners are remiss.
-  Move it!
- Oh, shut your bloody cakehole!
Don't do that!
He's getting out of his car now.
- Ooh, he's a tall one, too.
- Roll up your window!
He won't hurt a woman.
- Just roll it up!
- Oh!
Let him go!
-  Let him go, you big ugly oaf!
- Shut up!
Oh Well, we're moving.
Thank you, Pit Bull!
I had a lovely time!
You know, this cookie dough is not that bad.
Of course, I'm sure later I'll be hurling, but, well  - Her fabulousness.
Want that dough?
- I'd better not.
If I gain an ounce, she goes ballistic.
She makes me weigh in every morning.
- You poor thing.
- I'm used to it.
Hi, I'm back.
Renata, honey Sandy's waiting downstairs in the car.
Renata?
I must say, I had a rather enjoyable evening.
You don't get out much, do you?
I think she likes me.
Thank you for helping me out.
Now roll out that trolley.
I'm starved.
You know I don't think so.
Spend the evening with your daughter.
But I thought we had a date.
When we first met, I was attracted by your remarkable beauty, but now that I know a bit more about you, suddenly you don't look so good, sister.
Excuse me?
You don't leave your daughter on some street corner while you're getting tattooed, or keep her in some never-never land where everyone is nine forever!
Renata told you that?
Yes, she also told me about the time you left her with the coat-check girl.
What kind of mother are you?
Did it occur to you she might be lying?
Cos this is the first night I've been out in a year.
John and Marianne never take her, her father and his new wife.
- Who are Tony and Whitesnake?
- Our two dogs.
Most nights, I stay home and I help her with her homework.
Except last Saturday, when I took her and her 12 friends ice-skating.
I don't suppose that during that party you got your shoulder tattooed?
Do you see anything there, hmm?
No.
But then, my eyes are tearing up.
- But why would she lie?
- Because she's 12 and mad at me.
I wouldn't let her stay home alone.
I probably would have been better off if I had!
Some shrink you are  Child development is not my thing.
My specialty is adult relations.
You won't be having any of those tonight.
Don't go!
Oh, by the way, I only have one kidney.
Guess who has the other?
Is the coast clear?
Where's the supermodel?
She left.
I was afraid I might walk in on an embarrassing moment.
- You would have, half an hour ago.
- What are you doing still up?
I was just wondering if my sweet boy is going to be a monster when he's 12.
What the hell brought that up?
It's a long story.
Do you really want to hear it?
Well, it is getting late All kids start out cute, then somewhere along the way, they get into that know-it-all stage.
- You think they'll never grow out of it.
- Eventually they do.
I'm still hoping.
Hello?
Oh, Daphne.
How was your evening?
No way!
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seen a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
You've seen the executive offices, the advertising offices, lunchroom.
We have now come to the sanctum sanctorum: My studio.
- You recognise that handsome rogue?
- Wow!
Your head photographs even bigger than it is.
Very droll  We in the radio game call this "the booth".
It's here that I help the emotionally distraught through their troubled lives.
Mmm.
Suppose this stuff's bulletproof?
You could have gone home after lunch.
I thought you'd enjoy this.
Don't touch!
It's sophisticated equipment.
- What is it?
- I have no idea.
Roz said not to touch it.
- The usual procedure is - Testing, testing Dad, let's go into Roz's booth.
You can touch anything in there.
Hey, Frasier.
Hi, Mr Crane.
What brings you here?
He's gonna listen to the show.
When Frasier was a kid, I'd take him to the police station where I worked.
Yes, he used to make a game of locking us in a cell and pretending to lose the key.
- I knew they weren't scared.
- We weren't.
But after a while became quite hungry.
- Frasier, can you lend me ten bucks?
- Did you forget your wallet?
No, I gave my last money to this poor guy in front of the building.
He's an Australian tourist who just needed ten dollars - For a cab to the consulate?
- How did you know?
There is no Australian consulate in Seattle.
Oh, that poor guy.
Roz, he scammed you.
No, this guy was for real.
He even said "Give me your address.
I'll send the money back with interest".
God - I'm an idiot.
- No, don't feel bad.
These guys are professionals.
Don't touch that!
What is this place?
A radio station or a nuclear missile site?
Don't feel bad.
I was a cop for 30 years, and they still fake me out occasionally.
- These guys know what to do.
- Especially with easy marks like Roz.
The criminal mind is complex.
They can fool you.
Oh, lecture me on the complexities of the human mind.
I graduated in psychosocial behaviour.
I know, I was at your graduation - a car backfired and half of them wet their gowns.
It sounded louder on the dais.
Well, I wouldn't have been fooled.
Oh, you think you can spot a crook just like that?
- If I can't, I'm in the wrong business.
- You want to bet on that?
- Oh, what do you mean?
- It's poker night tonight.
Two of the players are cops, the third one's done time.
Five bucks says you can't tell the ex-con.
- Can I get in on the action?
- Of course.
Great.
Ten bucks on your dad.
You're itching to give your money away.
You're on, but you're underestimating me.
What troubles are to pigs so are these charlatans to my mental acuity!
We didn't know better back then.
His mother smoked during pregnancy.
Who are these people coming over tonight?
Dad's old friends from the precinct.
Someone should have been cleaned up because someone hasn't been smelling so fresh lately.
Because someone is long overdue for a tub.
I've had a shower.
Eddie is long overdue for a ba - Don't say that word.
- What word?
B-A-T-H.
His yawns may smell like swamp gas, but his spelling's improving.
I've made meatball sandwiches, pepperoni pizzas and sausage rolls.
Will you need anything else?
The number of the nearest gastroenterologist.
Hey, come in.
These are my poker pals.
Linda, Frank and Jimmy.
This is my son, Frasier.
Linda, Frank, Jimmy, nice to meet you.
Throw your coats on the couch.
Hard to tell, isn't it?
They all look like they did time!
My dad tells me, he's filled you in on our little bet.
I'm not allowed to ask any questions about your line of work, but whatever questions I do ask you must answer truthfully.
- I just want to play cards.
- Great place you got, Marty.
- Thanks.
- Actually, it's mine.
Your radio show must do well.
- Is this about 2,000 square feet?
- Yeah, about.
Hm, that's interesting.
You noticed the space.
Most people mention the view or high ceilings, but you mentioned the space.
It's almost as if you'd spent time living in a cramped, confining area.
You've been to Jimmy's apartment, huh?
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Daphne.
This is Daphne Moon.
These are my friends.
Linda, Frank, Jimmy.
Daphne - pretty name.
Do people call you Daffy?
Not twice.
It's nice to meet all of you.
I've got beers for everyone.
- Still drinking Ballantine's, I see.
- When you kick off, they'll go bust.
Often, I come home and see cans lined up, one after another like little tin soldiers Thanks.
Don't you have a dog to wash?
Well, I suppose I do.
Of course I have to catch the bugger first.
- Maybe one of these would help.
- Beer's not good for dogs.
No, but it's super for me.
- She's pretty nice.
- Sexy, too, you dirty old man.
- Oh - Interesting.
You find her attractive, do you?
Sure.
Don't you?
Yes, but attraction to one's own sex is a not uncommon result of long periods of time spent exclusively in their company.
- I may have underestimated you.
- Really?
Yeah, you're making a bigger jackass of yourself than I thought.
High card deals.
We could use some music.
Anybody play the harmonica?
All right, my deal.
Dollar ante to start.
Five-card draw.
- Three-raise maximum.
- You sure you won't play?
Oh, no, no.
I'll just observe the triumvirate.
I will use my considerable education and not to mention Well, all right, let's say it - my God-given gift to intuit.
This is the kid who used to get his head flushed in the toilet, right?
- All right, I call.
What you got?
- Full boat, aces up.
Damn it, that's another one.
I'm losing my shirt here.
Would somebody help me with the coffee?
- I will.
- OK.
- I like your accent, you're from?
- Manchester.
- Where the Beatles are from, right?
- Oh, no.
That's Liverpool.
- Who's from Manchester?
- No one.
That's why I live here now.
You've been awfully quiet.
- Sorry, just observing.
- No, don't apologise.
It was a compliment.
Frank's an interesting study.
Temper, loner, bit unsocial.
Almost stereotypical of a man who spent his entire life behind bars.
This dish a Lalique or a Steuben?
They had no spots in the laundry.
He worked in fine china and glasswares.
Here you go, big winner.
Buy yourself something pretty and frilly.
Sorry, Frank, I can't hear you.
I've got your money stuck in my ears.
I guess there's only one thing left.
How about it?
Figured it out yet?
I believe I have.
Shall we step into the drawing room?
Please have a seat.
OK, Sherlock, you got centre stage.
I have sketched an accurate psychological profile of you all, and have come to the incontrovertible conclusion that the criminal among us can only be Frank!
- Wrong.
Frank's an undercover cop.
Exactly!
Just a little too obvious.
The broken vocabulary, jailhouse pallor, - the underdeveloped social skills - Hey!
You used psychology, threw a gender-bender at me, thinking I would assume a felon would be a man.
Well, I'm on to you, mister.
The criminal is the very wily Linda!
- Nope.
- Jimmy!
- You're right.
- Damn - But you seem like such a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy.
He was voted most congenial in his cell block.
- Sorry.
You owe your dad five bucks.
- I'm afraid I do.
Oh.
You could probably use this.
It's been a lot of laughs, but it's late.
We better get going.
- Yeah, thanks, Marty.
- Yeah, it was great.
You all come again anytime you like.
Hopefully, when we're here, of course.
- Good night.
- See you.
Next week.
Jimmy.
Who'd have thought?
How do you even know that guy?
He was a jailhouse snitch.
He helped us.
I wouldn't trust him if he wasn't surrounded by cops.
- Who was a snitch?
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy's an ex-con?
- You proved your point.
I feel stupid as hell.
- I feel a fool myself.
- Why would you care?
I've agreed to go out with Jimmy tomorrow night.
- What?
- He asked if I'd like to go for drinks at the Topaz Room.
It sounded harmless.
It's out of the question!
Cancel!
You said yourself he was fun to spend time with.
I said do time with.
No, no.
You can't go.
Case closed.
Forget that police mentality.
Don't you believe in second chances?
I did, then we had Niles.
When a man has paid his debt to society, he deserves a fresh start.
- She's not going.
- She is!
- She isn't!
- She is!
Excuse me.
Might I interject one tiny thought into this conversation?
Belt up, both of you!
It may have escaped your notice, but I'm a grown woman.
Nobody has told me whom to date since school.
And I didn't listen then.
Now, when I've decided what I'll do about Jimmy, I'll let you know.
I'm going to my room!
You two hens have wasted enough of my time.
That would have been a very dramatic exit, if only her room was down that hall.
She shouldn't go out with that guy.
- She won't.
- How do you know?
She won't go against your wishes if I'm any judge of character.
Oh, dear God.
What can I get you?
- I'll have a decaf latte with skim milk.
- I'll have the same.
Got it.
Two gutless wonders!
Thank you!
Certainly playing fast and loose with tips for a man who drives a van.
Oh!
How was your encounter with Dad's poker buddies last night?
The picture of you trying to converse with Dad's cronies is priceless.
When I told Maris, it was all she could do to keep her eyes from dancing.
It was rather interesting.
One of them did time in prison for fraud.
- Good lord!
What was he like?
- Quite personable.
- Dad's so judgemental.
- He is, and I've often condemned him for it.
Just because the man was in prison he seems to be marked for life.
Ridiculous.
Not all criminals are recidivists.
Many have gone on to lead productive lives.
Dad's just being narrow-minded.
I almost had to sedate him when Daphne said she was going out with him.
I hope you're just yanking my giggle chain.
What do you mean?
You're letting this delicate English rose be sullied by some sociopath?
Oh Niles, he passed bad cheques.
- He's no sociopath.
- This degenerate should be put away.
- You haven't even met him.
- They're all depraved animals!
- Here's your coffee.
Anything else?
- Yes, the cheque, quickly!
- We've got to rescue her.
- Just sit down.
- You're being irrational.
- Don't call me irrational!
You know that makes me crazy!
Now, Niles, Jimmy's a nice guy.
And Daphne can take care of herself.
I don't care.
I'm not without resources.
My tae kwon do instructor says, I'm just two moves away from becoming quite threatening.
Niles, just listen to me.
She'll resent any interference.
Go and make a fool of yourself, but I won't.
- Fine.
Tell me where they went.
- The, er, Topaz Room.
I thought the cops shut it down after the last shooting.
I'll drive!
Your shot, girlie.
Why don't we make this more interesting?
All you have to do to win is run those last five balls.
- Let's double our bet.
- Oh, well, I might as well.
I never really have understood this game.
I never understood it when I first played it with my older brothers at the age of six.
And I never understood it during my formative years, spent mostly in the pool halls of Manchester.
I played in local competitions and club tournaments winning cup after cup, until our poor dad had to convert the pantry into a trophy room.
I can't claim to understand it - eight ball in far corner - even today.
But I certainly do enjoy it.
Thank you, gentlemen.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try to use the ladies' room without touching anything.
Look at this place!
I've never felt so conspicuous in my life.
We'll simply try to blend in.
Fortunately Fortunately, I haven't shaved for hours.
You should loosen your tie.
- Try tucking in your watch fob.
- That's a Phi Beta Kappa key.
Oh, then by all means let it dangle.
Perhaps they have a local chapter.
Actually, this is quite stimulating in a lower-depths way.
I'm something of a squalor buff.
The only problem is I don't see Daphne or Jimmy.
Excuse me.
Has a young woman been here - approximately 5ft 93/4, skin the colour of Devonshire cream and eyes that gaze into one's soul with neither artifice nor evasion?
This would be an Englishwoman named Daphne.
Oh, the one that came in with Jimmy.
She was shooting pool.
- She's in the back.
- What happened to Jimmy?
He tried to get fresh with her.
She threw a hammerlock, ran him out.
- That babe can take care of herself.
- I told you so.
Guy was no good.
I knew it the first time I saw him.
You can always tell.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You've had your walk on the wild side.
Let's go.
- What about Daphne?
- You heard what she did.
- She'll be mad if she finds us here.
- Let's make ourselves scarce.
Good lord, there she is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry - You made me miss that shot.
- I'm sorry.
- I had 200 bucks on that shot.
REALLY sorry.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.
I'll just put another quarter in the meter.
The meters don't run at night and neither do you.
An amusing play on words!
A regular George S Kaufman.
We must tell our friends about this place.
- You owe me $200.
- I don't have that kind of cash on me.
It would be absurd to bring it into a place like this with the kind of element - Maybe I could write you a cheque?
- My element don't take cheques.
Maybe we should take these guys outside and wise them up.
Oh, that's not necessary - Goodness!
What are you doing here?
- We might ask you the same thing.
This is one of our favourite haunts.
Actually, Maris and I had our rehearsal dinner here.
It was different then.
It was more of a garden room Shut up, Niles.
- You followed me, didn't you?
- We were worried.
Excuse me, it seems your friends can't pay the 200 they owe, so I'll have to - pardon my French - beat the crap out of them.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Maybe we could take this out in sessions.
- Outside!
- Wait!
I have money.
Would you like to go for double or nothing?
- On what?
- Well, you look like a betting man.
I'll wager I can sink these five balls with a single shot.
If I do, these boys are square.
If I miss, you double your money.
I'll take your money, but I was looking forward to pulping this guy.
Yeah, well, we won't quibble.
If I miss, you can pulp him.
I'm feeling generous tonight.
- I'll throw in the little one too.
- "Throw in the little one"?
And what in God's name is pulping?
You're on.
OK, just to make sure this is on the up-and-up, let's use six balls.
Instead of sinking all five with one shot, how about sinking all six?
Do that and I'll forget the 200 bucks.
Fair enough.
Need a bit of chalk for me cue.
Does it matter in what order I make them?
Daphne!
Hey, lady, if you make any of them, it'll be a miracle.
Right.
Well Here goes nothing.
Run for it!
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # And maybe I seem a bit confused Yeah, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face What is a boy to do?
# Good night, everybody!

'I've tried diet after diet 'from milk shakes three times a day to that lady on TV.
Nothing works.
' Hank, listen.
You've got to look inside yourself.
Part of you isn't being fed.
'Lt certainly isn't my butt.
' I'm talking about your inner self.
What isn't being fed there?
Love?
Career?
Simple self-esteem?
These are deep issues.
- 'So what do I do?
' - I'd suggest therapy.
Stay on the line and my producer will help you.
Roz, who's next?
We have someone who disagrees with your advice to Hank.
Oh, really?
Hello, you're on the line.
'Congratulations, Frasier, you've done it again.
' 'You've led another unsuspecting innocent 'down one of your dark, Freudian hallways.
' Lilith?
'Overeating is a behavioural problem caused by negative reinforcement.
'Lt can be cured by behaviour modification.
' Seattle, we have a celebrity of sorts on the line.
This is my ex-wife Lilith.
'What do you mean by celebrity?
' Oh, they know you.
Roz, what does "call screening" mean?
I put on the air the calls I wanna hear.
Lilith, what brings you to Seattle?
The constant rain?
'I'm here for a convention and I heard you on the radio.
'I hoped you'd introduce Pearl Jam's latest hit, 'but you were doling out worthless advice pellets 'from your psychiatric Pez dispenser.
' I guess you'll be rushing off to your convention.
We'll catch up on your next trip.
'I'm not doing anything for dinner tonight.
' Then you'll want to keep tuned to 780 for Gil Chesterton's restaurant beat.
Why don't you ask her to dinner, Dr Crane?
What a wonderful idea.
Let me tell you why, Seattle.
Although our marriage was unsuccessful, Lilith and I are capable of behaving as adults and even enjoying spending some time together from time to time.
- So, 7.00 at my place?
- 'Sounds great.
' In my day, when people broke up you hated each other.
What happened to the sanctity of divorce?
- Dad, you never liked Lilith.
- She's weird.
- She is not weird.
- Oh, she's weird.
Well, maybe she's a little strange.
No.
Maris is a little strange.
Lilith is weird.
Gee, Dad.
I had no idea you preferred my wife to Frasier's.
Oh, my head!
- Can I get you an aspirin, Daphne?
- No, those are useless.
This is one of my psychic headaches.
There's some kind of negative force.
I get these when there's a clawing at the cosmic continuum.
Perhaps if someone rubbed your temples Niles!
I'm sure she wants privacy while she contacts the mother ship.
Frasier, I'm here for support but I will not speak to Lilith.
This feud between you and Lilith is ridiculous.
Let it go.
- I can't recall what the fight was about.
- Let me refresh you.
At our wedding while Maris was reciting her vows - vows of love - I heard snickering.
I saw Lilith, fingers pressed against her lips, body shaking like a paint mixer.
Now there she is.
It's just one evening.
Will you at least try to be civil?
All right, but I refuse to be warm.
- Hello, Lilith.
- Frasier Please come in.
- Let me take these things for you.
- Thank you.
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Martin.
Hello, Niles.
Hello.
- Where's Maris?
- Visiting her sister in Chicago.
I thought perhaps she was sailing up the transplendent river of your love.
Frasier, I like your apartment.
You have some beautiful things.
The settlement is final, Lilith.
Go away.
Why does he listen to you and not me?
The tone of my voice means business.
Your voice is more commanding than mine?
Hell, I took a half a step before I realized she was talking to the dog.
Oh, my Lord.
I've never had a throbbing like this.
Daphne, this is my ex-wife, Dr Lilith Sternin.
Lilith, this is Daphne Moon, Dad's physical therapist.
- Nice to meet you.
- An equal pleasure.
When I shook hands I lost all feeling in me arm.
Frasier, I'm going to use the phone.
Maris has a cold.
I want to be sure she's taking liquids.
Isn't it enough that she's eternally sipping of your perpetual adoration?
Martin, I'm especially delighted to see you here tonight.
Oh, yeah?
Knowing the history of your relationship with Frasier, when I'd heard he'd taken you in I flipped to the weather channel to see if hell had frozen over.
Frasier, how did you ever let this little peach get away?
Dinner is nearly ready.
Let's move to the table.
Lilith, how is Frederick?
I've enrolled him in a chess camp.
It's really quite stimulating.
For eight hours a day he sits with 300 other children mastering the Alhausen-Grob opening.
Shouldn't he be out in the fresh air?
Every day they go for a nature walk.
Unfortunately, Frederick is allergic to seven varieties of ivy so he wears long sleeves and long pants, a bonnet with a net on it.
I hope the others don't make fun of him.
I'm sure they don't.
You know how kind kids can be  All he needs is a birthmark on his face and they'd beat him to death.
I chased him down an alley, then he pulled a knife so I gave him a few shots from my night stick.
Fascinating.
Were you at all aware of any repressed sexual urges while you were pummelling him so mercilessly?
Yeah, but I didn't put them in the report.
You're having fun at my expense.
Not much.
- In fact, I'm going to bed.
Good night.
- Good night, Dad.
If you don't need me I'll be shuffling off, too.
Good night.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
How long are you staying in Seattle?
Just the weekend.
Enjoy your stay.
I'll be dead by Saturday night.
I'll say my goodbyes as well.
Good night, Frasier.
This is ridiculous!
Lilith, listen, Niles is upset because you snickered at Maris' wedding vows.
I responded with a spontaneous emotion I was feeling at the time.
But if Niles is not mature enough to accept that, if he is so pitifully insecure, if he is in such need of validation, then for some sense of familial harmony, I do apologize.
Oh, Lilith, thank you!
Thank you!
This bad blood between us has gone on too long.
Next time you're in town, we'll have dinner - just you and me.
He doesn't get that kind of validation at home, you see.
Well It's just the two of us.
For the first time since the lawyers put us in that room and said, "Don't come out until there's some resolution".
Yes, well This was nice.
Yes, it was, wasn't it?
You have a beautiful view.
It's a beautiful city.
I hope you enjoy your convention.
For God's sake, Frasier, there is no convention!
- I'm here because of the letter.
- What letter?
You know very well what letter.
The one you left last month when you visited Frederick, proposing we get back together.
Surely you didn't forget.
"My darling, how could a love like ours fall so far from grace?
"Part of your heart must still resound to the rhythm of my own.
"I'll be lost without you.
"As long as we have love, love will keep us together".
Aside from the shameless pilfering from the Captain and Tennille, I was moved by your entreaty.
I felt the same, yet I needed to pretend to come for a convention because I was still unable to commit myself.
But seeing you now, I realize how much I've missed you Lilith, I did write that letter and I did leave it in the apartment but Yes?
It wasn't last month.
It was nearly a year ago.
It was before I moved to Seattle.
You just found it now?
It had fallen behind the dresser.
The cleaning service is doing its usual bang-up job  - Don't I feel like the perfect fool?
- Listen, Lilith I am humiliated, emotionally drained and I've used up all my frequent-flyer miles.
Lilith, please - There's nothing else to say.
I'd like to leave with at least a shred of dignity.
Thank you.
I wrote this letter just before I came to Seattle hoping for a reconciliation.
She only just found it.
Didn't Captain and Tennille sing this?
Like they own those five words!
I got over her, I moved out here, she comes back and I wonder if I made the right decision.
I did write that letter.
You have come to some sort of crossroads.
That's a tidy little way of saying I'm in hell.
Niles, my life suits me, yet I wonder if there is a chance for reconciliation, if it's worth exploring the feelings that I'm feeling.
Should I see her tonight?
Like most patients you know the answer to your question.
You want me to support you whether I share your opinion or not.
- I don't have an opinion.
- You do.
- But I don't.
- Then I can't help you.
All right.
All right.
In my soul, I'm leaning toward taking the next step and seeing if there's anything there.
- That is what you should do.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Damn it, Niles!
Frasier, you know why.
All right.
We have a long history together.
We have a son we both adore.
There were some good times, and when they were good, whoo-wa!
Our minds are pretty well made up.
Thank you, Niles.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
- Yes, you do.
- Drop it!
- Hello, Lilith.
- Frasier, come in.
I must be early.
You haven't put up your hair.
- I thought I'd leave it down.
- Really?
After several hours of deliberation and weighing the consequences, I decided to be playful.
I'm glad you invited me to dinner.
How could I not?
I felt so awful about last night.
I thought you'd read the letter long ago and ignored it.
No explanation necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
Well, I know a great little French bistro Frasier, before we go anywhere, I'd like to go on record as saying that, regardless of everything, I respect you for getting on with your life so successfully.
I feel the same way about you.
Frederick is flourishing and that's in no small part due to you.
Thank you.
That means a great deal to me.
That's the first pleasant thing we've said to each other in almost a year.
- You're right.
- You know, I'm suddenly quite moved.
I am, too.
Would it be a dreadful contretemps if I kissed you right now?
You can always try.
You wanna bag dinner?
There's a bed and an honour bar.
What more do we need?
- Come to me, my white-hot flame.
- I was insane to divorce you.
You're in my thoughts every waking hour.
- You're the only man I've ever loved.
- So are you.
Good morning.
Jolly good morning to you, too.
I could stay like this all morning.
Me too.
- I'm so glad I flew here to be with you.
- Yes, me too.
I'll get that.
It must be the breakfast we ordered last night.
I am famished.
You should be.
You were a busy boy.
- Good morning, sir.
- Just bring it in.
Here's something for you too.
Thank you.
Good day.
Funny how life takes its little turns, isn't it?
Yesterday when I woke up I never imagined I'd wake up here today.
Indeed.
We weren't overly impulsive, we weren't wrong.
It's just - This is a mistake.
- Thank God you said that!
Last night was enjoyable but who are we kidding?
We've gotten on with our lives.
I've got a new set of friends.
For the first time in years I'm happy.
Getting back together is the stupidest thing we could do.
I meant the eggs.
I ordered poached, not fried.
Well, you didn't let me finish.
You see, um After I play devil's advocate, I Oh, Frasier.
Don't insult me.
That's how you really feel, isn't it?
I'm afraid so.
Oh, Lilith, are you crying?
God, I'm sorry.
Once again, I've led you down an emotional primrose path.
Lilith I never meant to hurt you.
I don't blame you if you're mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at me.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
I've been so lonely, and your letter was like a life preserver.
I'm raising a child alone.
I'm scared.
I've always thought of myself as a strong person, but the truth is, I'm afraid.
That's why I convinced myself I was still in love with you.
You mean you're not?
No.
I'm not.
Good.
So what happened was because you were lonely and I was We all know what you were, Frasier.
Oh, Lilith.
Lilith, here.
Here.
Come with me.
Look in there.
Tell me what you see.
I'll tell you what I see the same strong-willed, dynamic, intelligent woman I married seven years ago.
You're suffering a temporary lapse.
Divorce does that to you.
I won't say anything as trite as someday you'll find someone, but I know this.
I know you.
I know that no matter what the future holds, you'll handle it.
Thank you, Frasier.
- You hungry?
- Yeah.
OK.
You always knew how to buck me up when I was blue.
You've helped me through some hard times yourself.
Those married years weren't all bad.
We did have some good moments.
The best one was Frederick.
We'll always have that.
And you know, even though we're not in love any more, you were always the most exciting lover I ever had.
In your heart of hearts you'd say the same about me.
They screwed up the toast, too.
I ordered rye.
Lilith.
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salad and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Good night!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Cappuccino, half-caf, non-fat milk, enough foam to be aesthetically pleasing.
- But it mustn't leave a moustache.
- Cinnamon or chocolate?
This is so complicated.
Um, cinnamon.
- And you?
- I'll have the - Look, it's Daphne!
- Daphne!
Oh, hello!
Thought you might be here.
Please, sit.
- I just stopped in for a bag of beans.
- Oh, well - Can I help?
- Two pounds of  Kenya blend.
- You remembered.
- What about my order?
Most people find it too intense.
I like something that holds its body on me tongue.
We've spilt something.
If you could Would you like something robust, if it didn't come on too strong?
If it was a little bit sweet I might like it.
- Want to come try my special blend?
- I'd love to.
Oh, nothing for me, thanks!
That man is hitting on our Daphne.
How does she stand it?
Apropos of nothing, how are things with you and Maris?
Are you implying my concern for Daphne is less than pure?
- You tell me.
- That's your shortcoming.
You're always suspicious.
You should have faith in people.
What's he doing?
- Bagging her beans.
- Oh!
I'm so excited.
Eric's taking me to hear his band.
It's not me night off, but I'll switch if that's OK.
Isn't he lovely?
I have a nickname for him.
Eric the Red.
It favours him, doesn't it?
He looks like a Viking.
- Well - Well, ta-ta.
Oh, look at me.
I forgot me beans.
Earth to Daphne.
How could she like him?
He has community college written all over him.
Niles, this infatuation with Daphne is getting out of hand.
I didn't mind when it was flirtation, but I can't help thinking that there's This is symptomatic of something wrong between you and Maris.
- Is it?
- I can't lie.
The truth is, Maris and I are in a bit of a rut.
We seem to have lapsed into grey, numbing blandness.
That's perfectly normal in a relationship of some years.
Try spicing things up a bit.
You mean, boudoir-wise?
- For starters, yeah.
- How?
Well The two of you could, uh Well, you could It's you and Maris, so you could I'm stumped.
How are you?
You wanna know?
Or are you making conversation?
If you wanna know, I'll tell you.
I was making conversation.
- Actually, I need advice.
- About what?
A subject in which you're well versed: Sex.
How can I help you?
What do you do when the romance goes out of a relationship?
I get dressed and go home.
Let's assume that you are capable of a long-term relationship.
- How would you keep things cooking?
- Once a boyfriend took me to a bar.
We pretended we were strangers picking each other up.
That was hot.
You used fantasy, role-playing?
We had so much fun we tried it again.
Next time, he got so into it he went home with another woman.
- I'm sorry.
- She was gorgeous.
One more drink I'd have gone home with her.
Women need to see the men they make love to as exciting, romantic figures.
If you want to keep her interested, create a fantasy for an evening.
Personally, I think you'd make a very sexy gladiator.
- This is not for me.
It's for Niles.
- In that case, make it a gladiola.
Niles!
Niles!
I'm sorry, but something horrible has happened.
Maris kicked me out.
Dear God, why?
What for?
- Oh, my!
- What's going on out there?
Niles?
Hello, Dad.
- I don't want to know.
- Wait.
There's a reasonable explanation.
All right, but I reserve the right to say "stop" at any time.
My plan was to leave a treasure map downstairs for Maris with clues to lead her to my whereabouts.
Then I'd hide in the linen closet and wait for her to find me.
Dressed like that?
Actually, no.
At the time, I was wearing only my eye patch.
But is it still an eye patch if you wear it on your Stop!
There I was - ooh - with my little plastic knife between my teeth.
Suddenly the closet door opened, and I found myself face to face with the maid.
She screamed - what I gather were unflattering things - in Guatemalan.
Maris stumbled upon the scene and ordered me out of the house.
I barely had time to grab my pantaloons and buckle my swash.
Dad!
Dad, it's not funny.
Where did you get that stupid idea?
Frasier?
All I suggested was role-playing.
You came up with pirates of the Caribbean.
- I've really bungled it, haven't I?
- These things happen.
Why don't you stay here now, and tomorrow you'll sort things out?
What if we don't?
They could use an extra busboy at the Jolly Roger.
I'll never be able to face the maid again.
I don't think it's your face she'll remember.
Come on, Niles.
Everybody has an embarrassing story.
Did I tell you about getting locked out, in my underwear?
- Every Thanksgiving.
- Don't worry, I won't be telling that story this year.
Canadian goose down pillow, Egyptian cotton sheet, - and a vicuna throw for if you're chilly.
- Perfect.
The service would've done you boys the world of good.
- Good night!
- Good night.
Maris and I have had difficulties before, but nothing this serious.
I feel terrible having her mad at me.
I wish I knew how to cry.
- Don't be embarrassed on my account.
- No, it's not that.
I just don't cry.
It's not in my nature.
When Maris' uncle died, I shut my hand in a door, just to make a decent show at the funeral.
You're a complex little pirate, aren't you?
- Well, good night, Niles.
- Good night.
Thank you, Eric.
I had a wonderful time.
Me, too.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
We've only had a few dates but I'm exhibiting the three signs of love.
I can't stop thinking about him.
I can't eat and I bought myself all new underwear.
We got to get her a girlfriend to talk to.
I called Maris.
She's in Arizona for the weekend.
- Why?
- She's flown to her favourite spa to contemplate our marriage - from a mud bath.
It'll be good for her.
Eric thinks the earth is grounding.
Eric, Eric!
Must everything always be about Eric?
!
I suggest when Maris returns you have intensive couples therapy Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
She just needs to know you love her.
Buy her flowers.
Fix a romantic dinner.
- That'll make any woman forgive you.
- That will work?
If it didn't, you wouldn't be here.
I'm willing to try, but our cook walked out in sympathy with Maris.
I could help you.
I have a late date with Eric ca, an elderly Aunt Erica, but I could have everything ready by the time Mrs Crane arrives.
Well, thank you, Daphne.
What does Mrs Crane like to eat?
You have free rein.
Bear in mind she can't have shellfish, poultry, red meat, nitrates, wheat, starch, sulphites, MSG or dairy.
- Did I say nuts?
- Oh, I think that's implied.
Come in and warm yourself by the fire.
- How did you get so wet?
- One of your trees blew down.
- I had to walk the last 100 yards.
- Oh.
I must say, you have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
It was in Maris' family for four generations.
When I was an intern I drove through these hills, never dreaming I'd live here.
Then one afternoon, there was Maris, looking so helpless, banging on the electric gates with her little fists.
- They'd locked her in?
- No, no, that was much later.
This time she had been at an antique mart.
Bought a rare bell jar once owned by Sylvia Plath.
The gates failed to open.
Naturally, I offered my assistance.
Our hands touched, there was a sudden spark of electricity, and, as if by magic, the gates parted.
- We took it as a sign.
- You were meant to be together.
Yes.
We were married just three short years later.
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
It's a glockenspiel.
We bought it on our honeymoon in Zurich.
I brought it down from the attic to remind Maris of better times.
It used to play beautiful music - now it doesn't.
How's that for irony?
Let's get you dry clothes, so you can make dinner and get home for your date.
Daphne?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
No, no.
I'm a psychiatrist - I can read the signs.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to spoil your reunion with Mrs Crane, but Eric broke up with me.
- He did?
- Yes.
He said he couldn't commit to me and his music.
He had to stay focussed.
I know it was an excuse.
I've heard his music.
- He must have another girl.
- Oh Oh, oh, oh!
He's a fool.
If he can't appreciate you, you're better off without him.
Right now, I'm not so sure, but thank you, Dr Crane.
Niles Crane.
Oh, Maris!
Where where are you?
What d'you mean you can't come home?
It's not that bad a storm.
Oh, Maris, I really think you should come home.
No, of course.
I don't want you travelling if it's not safe.
Yes, I understand.
See you tomorrow.
Well Seems like it's just the two of us.
You mean, Mrs Crane won't be coming?
Oh my, there goes the electricity!
What do we do now?
The storm's really bad.
You shouldn't drive.
You just spend the night there.
Good night, Daphne.
- You told her to spend the night?
- What's the problem?
- You know how Niles feels about her.
- Relax, it's just a little crush.
Yes, Niles is harmless.
He'd never try anything with Maris around.
Maris is in Arizona.
- I got to get Daphne out of there!
- Why?
It's a recipe for disaster.
All alone in a Gothic mansion on a rainy night.
It only lacks someone shouting "Heathcliff"!
across the moors.
- Wait!
- You're not coming.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Oh, Dr Crane, you play beautifully.
- Thank you.
I found this in the guest room.
I hope it's all right.
I thought you'd put on Maris' clothes.
Something bulky from her wool collection.
She's quite a bit smaller than me.
This was all I could find that fit.
- Should I go look for something else?
- No Yes.
No, oh, no  Ooh!
No.
As long as it's big enough.
And warm enough.
And silky enough.
And I have to make a phone call.
'Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
'I'm listening.
'   'Frasier, Frasier?
'I'm having a little crisis here.
Actually a large crisis.
'Lt's no time to screen calls.
Damn!
' - This is stupid.
- No.
- Nothing will happen between them.
- What if it does?
He's my brother, and he loves his wife.
Their marriage isn't everyone's cup of tea, but on some twisted, bizarre level it works for them.
If Niles hurts his marriage, he'd suffer.
I won't let him suffer.
You'll miss the Roosevelt.
I let you come if you agreed not to give directions.
It's just faster.
- Roosevelt will add ten minutes.
- In rain, it's faster.
- Spatial relationships change in rain?
- There's better traction.
If you had all-weather tyres like I told you - Come on!
- You had to buy some German thing We'd better make this last.
It's all that's left of the wood.
Don't worry.
If this runs out, there's an antique sideboard that I think is reproduction.
Oh, it's Eric, isn't it?
Don't know why I'm being so silly.
We weren't together long enough for anything to happen.
Powerful feelings can come from the promise of what might happen.
Anticipation makes all the little hairs on your neck stand on end.
- Dr Crane!
- Yes?
- We're losing the fire.
- No, we're not.
It's burning with the heat of a thousand suns!
It's down to its last embers!
Well, then, I'll put some wood on it.
You flooded it.
You cannot flood a fuel-injected engine.
This is maddening.
We're so close to the house, I can see the gargoyles.
- If we'd taken Roosevelt - We'd be stuck there.
- You made a mistake.
- That is it!
Call the auto club, I'll make a dash for it.
You should take the shortcut by the side of the fountain.
Same to you!
I suppose I just fall in love too fast.
The minute I feel that spark I give my heart away.
Daphne, stop being so hard on yourself.
What you see as a fault is also your greatest gift - to be so open and warm and loving.
You're so kind, Dr Crane.
I'm glad we ended up like this tonight.
So am I. It's just so nice to be with a man you feel so comfortable with.
I feel very close to you.
I feel very close to you too, Daphne.
It's easy being someone you feel close to, when you feel close to someone who's so close.
Dr Crane, your glockenspiel has sprung to life.
Oh, the clock!
My God, it hasn't run like this in years!
Maris will be delighted!
Maris!
You really love her, don't you?
You know, I do.
Love's a funny thing, isn't it?
Sometimes it's exciting, passionate.
Sometimes it's something else.
Something comfortable and familiar.
That newly exfoliated little face staring at you across the breakfast table.
Sharing a laugh when seeing someone wearing white after Labour Day.
I hope some day, some man will feel that way about me.
Oh!
Daphne, don't worry.
You are a very special person.
Some day a man worthy of you will come along.
Just as soon as the gods create him.
That's the loveliest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Thank you.
You're a good friend.
STOP!
!
!
Frasier!
- Have you gone mad?
You'll regret it.
- What are you talking about?
The two of you alone.
The fire, the candlelight, the nightie!
Dr Crane, you didn't think Dr Crane and I Dr Crane!
You have some nerve to imply your brother would do anything so deplorable!
!
He just made a beautiful speech about how much he loves his wife.
How he cherishes her excruciating little face.
And how they laugh at white people.
- That didn't sound right.
- Close enough.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to suggest I wasn't implying Then what was it you wanted us to stop doing?
I wanted you to stop uh standing in silence!
A night like this calls for music!
Daphne, wine for all of us.
Niles, join me at the piano, please.
- You sure everything's all right?
- Absolutely.
Frasier, my glockenspiel is working again.
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# Maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe, but I got you pegged # But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Frasier has left the building.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Remember, cosmetic surgery is only a superficial solution.
' It can lift eyelids, but not the little cloud of pessimism hovering over you.
Thank you for your call.
OK, Roz, so who's our next caller?
Roz?
This'd be a good time to go to commercial break.
We'll be right back after these messages.
- Frasier?
- Hello.
Disturbing seeing no one there?
I was finding out if they've announced the nominations for the SeaBs.
I forgot, are those out today?
You forgot?
The biggest award in Seattle radio!
I suppose it's the difference in our ages.
I don't get excited about well, much anymore.
Congratulations.
- Yes!
Yes!
We got the nomination!
- Who'd you hear it from?
I haven't.
I was congratulating you on a great show.
If anyone deserves a nomination, you guys do.
- Get out, Noel.
- OK, catch you later.
Well, I guess I'm a little more excited than I let on!
- It'd be a feather in my cap to win.
- Are you kidding?
!
In ten years, I've never produced a show that got nominated.
Hello hi, Millie you're kidding!
- That's great!
Thanks, bye.
- We got the nomination?
- No, Millie's getting married.
- Damn it, Roz!
She said she'd been seeing someone else - couldn't keep living a lie.
I was dumbfounded.
What about everything we'd gone through?
Didn't that mean anything?
Niles, a patient has a right to change therapists.
- Frasier, thank God!
- What're you doing here?
What kind of agent would I be if I didn't tell you you've been nominated?
!
I was nominated!
Ha-ha!
Well I was!
Yes, you Frasier Crane, MD, PhD, STUD, are the man of the hour!
Bebe Glazer, Frasier's agent.
Dr Niles Crane, Frasier's brother.
- You're not a psychiatrist, too?
- Yes.
Oh, please, if I'm ever to have a breakdown, let me have it now.
Double double decaf to go.
So, this is quite a surprise.
I forgot the nominations were out today.
Oh, isn't he precious?
You must be very proud of Frasier.
Actually no.
It's one more signpost on the road of celebrity my brother's chosen.
Hope that's not sibling rivalry rearing its green snout?
!
Absolutely not.
I believe psychiatry's a noble profession, tarnished by popularity contests and a bouncy radio programme!
I bet you two had wicked little hair-pulling fights when you were tots!
It's been delightful, I must run.
My sexual addiction group - I don't like to leave them alone too long.
- Frasier!
- Roz!
We did it!
I know!
Come sit down.
I've never won before.
Although back in prep school the existentialist club once named me most likely "to be"!
You wanna hear the great part?
I've a date for the ceremony - Brad Macnamara!
The Channel Eight reporter?
Television's most handsome man.
He wouldn't give me time of day but one nomination - he knew who I was!
Who are you?
Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer.
Oh, right.
I've seen you bring him coffee.
Would you mind getting mine?
Better get on the ball.
I've a lot to do!
Not really, I got your tux, rented a limo, your tickets will be at the door.
The only thing you haven't taken care of is finding me a date?
!
Your subtlety floors me!
I'd love to!
I'm thrilled, for you both - but I've got to run.
Two clients weren't nominated.
I have to tell them what a worthless award this is!
Daphne, you may not be aware of this, but there's a secret to opening champagne.
Especially a fine French champagne as unprepossessing as this one - $200 a bottle.
In order to prevent spillage one does not simply twist out the cork.
Instead, hold the cork stationary.
Give the bottle three easy turns.
One  Get some glasses!
Quick!
Oh oh, my god.
Eddie, get out of there, you mangy little cur!
Here Oh, Lord.
That wasn't too bad.
I believe we've salvaged most of it.
A toast.
To my number-one son, congratulations on your first nomination for well, anything!
- Frasier, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, means a lot to me.
Mm this champagne is delicious.
Exquisite.
Dad, what do you think?
I was in the mood for something domestic!
I must say, it's nice that although I'm an employee, you include me in family celebrations.
Never doubt that I think of you as my equal in every way.
Oh, I'll get it.
- Would you?
- Like me to announce your visitor?
Just open the door!
Oh, hello, Roz!
Congratulations Thanks.
I couldn't believe it myself.
Brad Macnamara!
Roz, she was referring to your SeaB nomination.
No, I meant Brad Macnamara.
- Think he wears pants under the desk?
- Not on my TV!
Girls, can we cut out the pyjama party, please?
- Hello, Mr C. - Hey, Roz, how's my girlfriend?
Well, she's nominated.
A glass of champagne?
It's French and unprepossessing.
Save your breath.
It could come out of a box - Roz would have a glass of it!
I'm so proud of you, Roz, being recognised in a male-dominated industry.
- One more step for working women.
- You're a credit to our gender.
Thank you.
That reminds me, do you have a push-up bra I could borrow?
- I'll look.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry to barge in but I had to show you this, Frasier.
A friend at "Broadcast" magazine sent me a copy.
It's a full-page ad.
'Wendy Yashiro thanks the voting committee for her nomination 'and hopes they consider her for the award.
' This is shameless self-promotion, very bad taste!
I know!
What'll we put in our ad?
Wendy Yashiro's up against you?
I like her - she's a cutie!
You're suggesting we put an ad in?
We're falling behind, Mike Sanchez has sent out tapes of his show.
Mike Sanchez?
Oh, I like him!
Who knows what Fletcher Grey's doing?
- Fletcher Grey!
!
-  Thank you, Dad!
Geez!
Well, all right.
As long as it's tasteful and understated.
Great.
My friend'll work something up for us.
Wait.
If we want to stand out, why run another boring ad?
We should do something different.
Last year's winner threw a party.
OK, but we should do something else to keep our names in their minds.
I know, personalized gifts from the new Tiffany's catalogue!
- Ooh, that's good!
- I saw incredible cigarette cases.
No - sends out a bad message.
A silver flask?
We've already got your vote, Roz.
I mightn't know about show business, but gifts for people who could do something for you, that's bribery!
It's a thank you for a nomination!
If I had to give a gift to get an award it's not worth having.
You might as well just go down to the trophy store and buy one.
- I really want that award.
- Me, too.
Get that catalogue!
Well, are you coming in or not?
This is a big moment.
I want to drink it in.
Me, too.
Where's the bar?
Not so fast.
Me shoes are killing me!
I should never have let that salesgirl talk me into them.
- They look good on you.
- You think so?
Dr Crane.
Bob Peterson, voting committee.
- I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you.
- Oh, and thanks for the bathrobe.
- Oh nothing!
People get out of the shower, they're cold!
Hey, Dr Crane, love the watch!
Thanks, it was nothing.
Pretty good likeness of me, isn't it?
!
Can we please sit down?
I have got to sit down.
Daphne, we're table eight.
This isn't our table!
It is now!
- Isn't that Fletcher Grey?
- I believe it is.
You got your work cut out for you.
A class act!
I've listened to him for 20 years.
I don't usually do this, but I'm going to shake his hand.
Hey, guys.
Oh, Roz.
My fellow nominee.
Everybody's talking about those gifts.
Did you see valet parking?
Half the key chains are ours!
This is a big night for me.
Please don't spoil it by making fun of who I brought.
I thought you were bringing Brad Macnamara.
He got called out on a story.
Some hospital went up in flames.
Do you know anyone who has worse luck than I do?
Hi, Dr Crane.
- Oh, hi, Noel - Noel Shempsky's your date?
Uh, tip, Dr Crane?
If you're nominated again, there's parking three blocks away - they don't check after 6.00!
Oh, um here are the car keys so you can drive us home.
I have night blindness.
I wish I did.
- Hi.
I'm Noel.
- Nice to meet you.
Can you rub me feet?
- Oh, Daphne!
- Good evening, everybody.
- Niles!
Thanks for coming!
I know how you feel about this award and coming downtown after dark.
Don't be silly, you're my brother.
- Hello, Daphne.
- Can you rub me feet?
- Yes.
- Niles!
- Where's Maris?
- We were leaving when Maris glimpsed herself in the mirror At the end of this, will I roll my eyes?
- I did.
- Well, then, skip it!
Listen, get me a Scotch, would you?
That Fletcher Grey, he's aces!
He remembered me from 1968!
I worked on a murder case he covered.
He looked at me and said, "Hey, you're the guy who found the head"!
He's been nominated 11 times and never won.
Really?
Geez, I didn't know that.
I'm afraid he'll have to lose again.
If he does, you can cheer him up - send something from your gift shop!
- Dr Crane?
- Fletcher Grey!
Been meaning to wish you luck even though you don't need it.
That's kind, but I hardly think I have a chance against you!
I hope you're right.
I'd love to win.
Oh, you'd have to lose 15, 16 times before you could feel ashamed.
Would you believe, I considered campaigning this year?
Sending out gifts, throwing a party.
I bet you'd have something to say about someone that self-absorbed!
He could do a whole hour on it!
Dear, they're starting to serve the salads.
Oh, Mom!
I'm 60 years old and I'm still her little boy.
- Dr Crane.
My mother, Hannah.
- Nice to meet you.
Mom just flew in from Scottsdale.
This is her 11th year.
I hope he wins it this time.
It's getting harder and harder to get on that plane.
Why don't you go back to the table before your legs swell up?
I'll get you another Pink Lady.
No, no, no, Mom, over there.
Sorry - been detained!
Civilization won't advance one iota till they put more toilets in the ladies' room!
- Thank you, Niles.
- Oh, champagne!
Uh, a diet root beer?
I have to tell you the buzz in line was that those gifts you've been sending paid off.
It looks like you're in a neck-and-neck race with Fletcher Grey, that wrinkled warhorse Hello, Mr Crane.
You're more handsome than before!
If I were 20 years older, they couldn't keep me away!
That's why I keep this cane!
Good evening, would everybody take their seats?
I'm Keith Bishop, welcome to the 15th annual SeaB awards.
Assisting me tonight in handing out the awards is Miss SeaB 1994, Tawny Van Deusen.
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about the campaigning.
Fletcher's been nominated 11 times!
He didn't lift a finger to win this.
Don't worry about him, he can win it next year.
Before we start this evening, I'd like to make a sad announcement.
I just found out that the Dean of Seattle radio, my mentor, Fletcher Grey, will be retiring this year.
Ahhhh!
Take a bow, Fletcher.
We're gonna start with a bang!
The award for achievement in informational programming.
That's us!
Can't see a thing without my glasses!
Fletcher deserves this award.
If we win - can't we just not accept it?
I've waited ten years to get this.
If I have to crawl over Fletcher's mother to get it, I'll do it!
Roz, I've never seen you like this!
- It isn't pretty - The nominations "Community Forum" - Wendy Yashiro: Talent, Mike Freedman: Producer.
"Consumer Update" - Mike Sanchez: Talent, T J Chester-Nuevo: Producer.
"The Frasier Crane Show" - Dr Frasier Crane: Talent, Roz Doyle: Producer.
Bravo!
"Fletcher Grey: From Where I Sit" - Fletcher Grey: Talent and producer.
Bravo!
Bravo!
If we win this thing, they're gonna lynch us!
At least everyone will see my dress!
Well, this is a first.
It seems we have a tie.
- Good, we can share it with Fletcher!
- I'm already sharing it with you!
And the winners are Wendy Yashiro and Mike Sanchez!
- What?
- What?
The party's over.
Are you coming home?
- No, Dad.
- We'll just go without you.
Fine.
I don't agree with the way you went about it but I'm sorry you lost.
It's never easy to lose.
Thanks, Dad.
Of course, if you'd joined sport at an early age - Dad - All right, sorry, wrong time!
We'll talk about it over breakfast.
OK, Daphne, let's get you home and soak your feet in Epsom salts.
Oh, I have the life of a princess!
Don't feel bad, Roz.
It's an honour just to get a nomination.
Will you stop saying that?
OK, I'm leaving.
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm just despondent.
No, no, go ahead.
Roz!
Noel, Noel, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'll see you at work on Monday?
- How are you?
- Oh, I've been better.
Thank you.
When you feel the sting of losing you have to realise the fact that it's not about awards, it's not about accolades, it's about a body of work.
If you can look in the mirror and say you've done a good job, that's what matters.
If you can do that, let the awards fall where they may.
Wow!
All those nominations, nothing to show for it.
He still walks out, head high, and a smile on his face.
I'm never gonna get nominated again.
- Oh, come on, Roz.
- I'm not.
The world's full of winners and losers - I'm a loser.
- I wouldn't be with you if you were.
- Come on, we're a team.
Before we're done we're going to win lots of these things.
You and I are amigos, compadres.
OK?
Now, I'm not going to leave your side till I see a little smile on that face.
Dr Crane?
I love your show and I was wondering - would you like to have a drink?
Do I see the beginning of a little smile?
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thanks, Roz.
So, that's a very interesting name you have.
- You mean "Miss SeaB"?
- Well, actually, I, uh yeah.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged # But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Goodnight, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
I would like to depart from my usual format because I read a book that It truly just knocked my mental socks off.
It's called "The Menopausal Male".
Its author, the psychiatric scholar Dr Helmut Bruga, has agreed to join us today from the University of Washington.
Dr Bruga, guten Tag.
I've been an admirer of yours for a long time.
'I enjoy your show as well.
' Really?
'Yes.
Though I do not in most cases agree with your analysis.
' Back to your book.
We're familiar with the changes that occur in the female menopause, but 'Excuse me, Dr Crane.
May I say hello to Roz?
' Yes, of course.
- 'Hello, Roz.
' - Hello, Dr Bruga.
Your research indicates that the reproductive imperative is reawakened in later life when a man is 'You have a very sensuous voice.
' Thank you.
- 'Not you.
Roz.
' - Yes, well, back to male menopause 'Would you like to go to a movie, maybe grab a bite?
' Well, that would be very No, thank you very much.
Thank you for joining us, Dr Bruga, and for so vividly proving your point.
- 'You will give Roz my number?
' - Oh, I think Roz has your number.
- Oh, hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
Is this a bad time?
Your brother isn't home, your father's out walking Eddie.
Oh, darn the luck.
I stopped by to drop off this necklace for Maris.
I'll hide it here till her birthday.
- I'm sure it will be fine.
Mind if I peek?
- Not at all.
Oh!
My!
Emeralds!
Your practice must be doing well.
Who'd have thought the mentally disturbed had this much money?
- Would you like to try it on?
- Oh, yes!
Wouldn't Mrs Crane mind?
No.
Maris is the soul of generosity.
Just last week, she donated all her old cocktail dresses to a homeless shelter.
Oh, let me just get my hair out of the way.
Oh!
Oh, my!
- Can you see them?
- Oh, yes, thank you.
Hello, Niles.
Whatever are you doing here?
I bought an emerald necklace for Maris, and I needed someplace to hide it.
Emeralds?
Well, may I see it?
Not at the moment, no.
- Why not?
- It's down me blouse.
I see.
Well, I'm sure Maris will never think of looking for it there.
It slipped down there when I was trying it on.
I'll go extract it.
Just call me butterfingers.
Join a health club, Niles.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad.
- Niles, what brings you by?
- I'm hiding Maris' birthday gift.
Oh, it's that time again.
I guess I'll have to get her something.
Too bad.
I just got back from the hardware store.
I saw a great ratchet set.
As if there's anything left on her that needs tightening.
- Oh, Dad, no, not more duct tape!
- Yeah I got to repair a little split in the old throne here.
Got to catch these rips early, or they look like hell.
- Why don't I bring the Eames here?
- Oh, no.
I need a comfortable place for my fanny.
-  How about Florida?
- I heard that.
I put all this care into decorating my home, only to have it mocked by this atrocity.
It is your home.
Why don't you just make him get rid of it?
It's not so simple.
One would have to find the right moment.
One should consider Dad's feelings.
- He is attached to this little chair.
- You're afraid to stand up to him!
Oh, like you're not!
At least I don't have to live with something unattractive.
I'm just having some fun with you.
I think Maris is rather attractive in a minimalist sort of way.
Oh, forget it.
I'm just upset about the chair.
There's a sound psychological basis for getting rid of this chair.
- Oh, really?
Enlighten me, Doctor.
- With pleasure.
Originally, Dad needed it to bridge the transition from his old apartment.
But, as with all transitional objects, be they a teddy bear, be they a thumb, be they a blanky Stop saying "be they"!
The point is, there comes a time when you must put these security objects aside and reassert your independence.
Yes, of course.
So you're saying that if I should go down to the store, buy Dad a new chair and throw this one away, I'd be doing it for him?
It would be a payback for when he used your blanky to clean his revolver.
Oops, I'm sorry.
Our time is up.
Dear God, Frasier, we've stumbled upon hell's waiting room.
This is not for the faint of heart.
We're treading a thin line here.
We need something that complements my decor and pleases Dad.
Oh, dear God!
How could anyone have something like that in their living room?
It looks like it's upholstered in golf pants.
Perhaps you could help us?
- Perhaps.
- We need a chair.
- We got 'em.
- Wait.
We'd like one with the presence of a Mies van der Rohe, and the insouciance of a Le Corbusier.
This one vibrates.
Perhaps you could direct us to your recliners, preferably one in suede.
People seem to like this Lazy Guy.
What do they call the deluxe model: The Hopeless Slackass?
Oh, hey!
What about this one over here?
That would not look altogether hideous in my living room.
Have a seat.
It's got Swedish massage.
- No, thanks.
- No, no.
Go ahead.
Try it out.
- I'll fire it up for you.
- That won't be necessary.
I like to sit in my chair, not vibrate.
Thank you any Oh!
Ooh!
- It also has shiatsu.
- Ohh I never knew a chair could be this satisfying.
I never knew anything could.
I want it!
I'm sure it would fit in with Maris' antiques?
!
Then I'll just rent it an apartment and visit it on the side.
Why don't you have a try yourself?
No.
You see, I'm buying it for my father - You must sit in it.
- Who knows other people's tastes?
Something seems wrong Turn on this.
Ohh Oh, mommy!
Eddie!
What is the matter with him?
He saw your father's chair was gone.
He's afraid your father's gone too.
He suspects foul play.
Stop it!
If I'd stuck Dad's feet in cement and thrown him into Puget Sound, you would have been the tiny little splash that followed him!
Oh, that must be Leo!
Wait till you see this!
- Make way.
- Just be careful.
Watch the furniture and the walls.
Excuse me, but I'm a professional.
I take pride in my work How did that get there?
At least I didn't lose my licence this time.
- Quickly!
- I'm sure Beavis will start to wonder where you are.
Leo, we're having a problem with a leaky faucet in the sink.
- Where would that be?
- In the kitchen, dear.
That wasn't a dumb question.
You got bathrooms too.
None that you'll be going anywhere near.
It's lovely!
I thought the other one was nice, but this is smashing!
Try it out.
And it has a little surprise.
Ooh.
This is comfy.
Although it's a little on the soft side.
I prefer Hello.
Ohh Ohh Ohh This is enough to make me give up me search for a meaningful relationship.
Oh, quick!
Dad!
Get out!
Oh, all right!
Just like a man!
Now you've had your fun, you don't care where I am!
- Hey there.
- Hi, Dad.
I've got a surprise for you.
- What's that?
- It's your new easy chair!
Well, what do you know about that?
- Where's my old chair?
- In the storage space.
Try this.
Look, I appreciate this, Frasier, but that It really isn't me.
Dad, you haven't even sat in it yet.
Come on down, Martin Crane.
That's disgusting!
I'm sorry, but I'm a creature of habit.
I think I'd rather have my old chair back.
But why?
This chair is a lot more comfortable and it's therapeutic.
I know, I just never cared for leather.
You stick to it in hot weather, you can't sit in it in shorts.
It makes my back sweat.
Black's hot.
I'm sorry, I just couldn't get used to it.
All right.
The important thing is that you lived with it for a full 15 seconds.
Leo!
Leo, bring Mr Crane's chair back.
- Sorry, Fish 'n' Chips.
Someone took it.
- What?
Someone broke into my storage space and stole the chair?
- Storage space?
- That's where I told you to put it!
Not another day like last Tuesday.
- Where is it?
- It was snagged from the dumpster.
- I almost kept it myself.
- You threw it away!
You happy now?
You have to find it.
I don't care what you have to do.
- Just find the chair!
- "Dump the chair, get the chair".
- Am I the building lackey?
- YES!
Oh, OK.
Well, if no one's going to want this, we could put it in my room.
Maybe later.
You two talk it over.
You've been trying to get rid of it from the day I moved in!
You could at least show a little gratitude.
I did this for you.
- Like hell!
- You think I lost it on purpose?
Let me tell you something.
That chair was the only thing that made me feel comfortable, like maybe this was my home too.
Ever since you got here, I've tried to make you comfortable.
But why?
Everybody knows Martin Crane doesn't like calfskin!
He prefers duct tape!
And food crumbs!
There we are.
And let's have a dribble of beer while we're at it!
Delightful!
Let's not forget, to top it all off, just the slightest bit of dog hair, hmm?
I suppose you'll throw Eddie out next?
We're talking about a 25-year-old broken-down chair!
If you don't like this chair, I'll get you any one you want!
All right, I'll tell you what chair I want.
The chair I was in when Armstrong walked on the Moon and when the US hockey team beat the Russians.
The one I was in when you called me to say I had a grandson.
The one I was in all those nights when your mother used to wake me up with a kiss after I'd fallen asleep in front of the TV.
I still fall asleep in it.
Every once in a while when I wake up, I still expect your mother to be there to lead me off to bed.
Oh, never mind.
It's only a chair.
Come on, Eddie.
- How was your weekend?
- Hellish.
Let me tell you what happened to me.
I had the most incredible date Saturday!
It was really hot!
- Sunday, I'm driving home - Sunday?
I told you it was hot.
My car breaks down in front of a church, people are coming out after the show - Service.
- What?
Churches have services.
- Can I finish my story?
- All right.
Thank you.
So, I walk up to the minister.
I ask him if I can use his phone, and he tells me my sweater's on inside out.
We have a date tonight.
Ministers aren't celibate, are they?
Not that I don't love a challenge.
Maybe you should take a sick day, call into the show yourself.
You're on the air.
Good afternoon.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Before I take my first caller, I'd like to make a personal appeal.
Saturday, my father's chair was taken from outside the Elliot Bay Towers.
It's a runny, split-pea green and mud-brown striped recliner with some stuffing popping out from underneath a strip of duct tape.
I'm offering a handsome reward for its safe return.
Thank you.
- Who's on line one?
- It's John So remember, Stephanie, a little emotional flexibility is a good thing.
Just as the mighty oak snaps and falls in a windstorm, so the weeping willow bends and lives to see another day.
Thank you.
So, any update on the chair?
- The calls have been pouring in.
- Really?
What are they?
Spotted at the top of the Space Needle, in the Governor's mansion One man saw it flying over his house, but thought it was just a tacky spaceship.
Funny stuff, people.
Let's just go to commercial break so you all can chuckle through these words from Yukon Lumber.
Ingrates!
I clear away their psychic debris, and this is how they repay me.
Uh-huh.
I got it.
He'll be there after the show.
Thank you.
- I found the chair!
- Oh, thank God!
By tonight, my dad will be safely back in his beer-stained, flea-infested, duct-taped recliner, adjusting his shorts and cheering on Jean-Claude van Damme.
Yes, it's quite a little piece of heaven I've carved out for myself.
OK, OK, that was nice.
Er, but let's just remember, there is a fine line between good acting and hamming it up.
- Let's try again.
- Excuse me - I can't find my moustache.
- I can't remember any of my lines.
- I'm really nervous.
- Me too.
- Can you all come here for a second?
- Mrs Warren?
This isn't Broadway, it's junior high.
No reason at all to be nervous.
We'll go out there tonight in front of family and friends and have fun, OK?
- OK!
- If one more thing goes wrong, I'll have to take my own life.
- If I could have a word with you.
- Sorry.
In 45 minutes, a shaky production of "Ten Little Indians" starts.
Oh.
I recognised the mise en scéne.
I did this play years ago.
"On the contrary, "many a psychotic killer appears to be quite normal.
"You can never suspect that underneath that calm exterior "there lies the heart of a maniac.
Ha-ha".
It happens to be true, by the way.
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
From the radio.
KACL talk Never mind.
I was told my chair would be here.
I'll just get this out of your hair, if I may.
Excuse me.
Right now this chair's the most entertaining thing on stage.
- That's true, but - Ow!
Ah!
Just run along to the nurse's office.
They'll have you back here soon.
I am so sick of being positive.
This chair belongs to my father, and I must return it to him.
Sir, you can have it back in two weeks.
I'm in a difficult position.
Difficult?
You want difficult?
I have a rickety set, a leading man whose voice changed at 3:00 pm today, and my name is spelt wrong in the programme!
See what I did there?
That's the kind of anger I want in the accusation scene.
- I'll give you $200 for a new chair.
- Forget it.
Mrs Warren, I am speaking to you now from the heart.
By putting this chair into the trash, I have wounded my father.
It's just a chair to you.
To him, it is a treasure trove of memories.
I thoughtlessly discarded it because I didn't like it in my living room!
I have sacrificed heart and soul for form and function!
I am ashamed for that!
This chair is the last chance to forge a meaningful relationship with the only father I'll ever have!
People, were you all listening to that?
Because you can learn a lot from this man.
That speech he just gave is a perfect example of the kind of hammy overacting I don't want to see out of you.
- Hold on!
- Mrs Warren!
Bobby just threw up backstage!
Perfect.
My Dr Armstrong has opening-night jitters.
No, it's stomach flu.
He's in the nurse's office.
You'll have to cancel the performance.
Too bad.
I'll just take this.
I can't cancel.
I have 300 parents in their cars already.
The American theatre will survive.
You can't do the show without Dr Armstrong.
That's the part I played.
- You played Dr Armstrong?
- Well, yes Oh, no.
You're not How badly do you want your chair?
I'm sorry.
It's out of the question!
You know, it would be a real shame if something Oh!
happened to this chair.
But it's been years!
I hardly can remember any of the lines!
Then you'll fit right in.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Yeah, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face What is a boy to do?
# Thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Hello, Rachel.
-  'Thanks for taking my call.
'I'm involved in a strange love triangle.
' - This is sweeps week!
- 'I recently married a widower.
'Phil is a real good man, he's a kind man.
'But there's one problem.
'He insists on keeping an urn with his late wife's ashes - 'on the dresser in our bedroom.
' - That is a definite "yikes".
'I knew that wasn't normal!
He says it is ' Rachel, before you go off half-cocked, let's try to remember, this is a sensitive issue for your husband.
Those ashes mean a lot to him.
It's not appropriate to keep them in the bedroom, but you could move them to another room.
'I could try that.
Maybe I'll move them into the guest room.
'  'Oops!
' - What happened?
- 'Oh, nothing.
I'd better run, Dr Crane.
'I've got some vacuuming to do.
' As Rachel helps Phil's first wife off the floor, we're at the end of our second hour.
We're back after the news.
Please join me, Frasier Crane, and my invaluable producer uh uh - Roz!
- Roz.
KACL talk radio, 780AM.
Roz, I'm so sorry!
Your name was in front of me, and I couldn't put my finger on it!
- Forget about it.
- It's been happening to me a lot lately.
Last night I walked into the kitchen, and I couldn't remember what for.
- Don't make yourself crazy.
It's normal.
- OK.
Your hairstylist confirmed your appointment.
I don't remember making one.
You didn't.
I was just gaslighting you.
- That is not funny!
- Oh, lighten up.
- Here, sign these.
- All right.
Will you say it or make me wait till the end of the day?
- Say what?
- "Happy birthday".
It is not your birthday.
Oh, God, it is!
Oh, Roz, I'm so sorry!
Let me take you out after work, OK?
- You are so easy!
- Oh, that's it!
I'm out of here!
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- No, I am not!
You can't blame a girl for trying.
Five, four, three, two We're back.
Ten.
No, Eddie, no.
Dad, ask your dog to stop burrowing at my shoes.
It took six months to have them sent from a blind cobbler in Seville.
- He won't stop till you scratch him.
- Oh.
All right, Eddie, all right.
You know, I'm beginning to think I have an affinity for animals.
Would you mind if I noodle at the piano?
- Would it stop you if we said, "yes"?
- Point well taken.
That's strange.
For the life of me, I can't remember the next note.
I know this backwards and forwards!
Perhaps if you start at the end, you'll have better luck.
Oh, come on.
You know how it goes.
It goes: Da-da-da-da Oh, thank you, Dad.
Now it's perfectly clear  That was very nice, Son.
How about something from "South Pacific"?
I'm sorry, I'm just getting fed up with this nonsense.
I keep forgetting names.
Last week, twice I forgot where I parked my car.
Join the club, pal.
You're getting older.
Of course I'm getting older.
We all are.
I'm not that old.
I'm afraid Dad may have a point.
I know you'd like to believe we're still the same devilish sprigs we always were, sitting on mother's davenport in our tweeds and tams listening to the "Texaco Symphonic Hour".
But the cold, hard reality is you're middle-aged.
I'm 41.
That's hardly middle-aged.
Middle-aged is more like 50, 55.
Only if you live to be 110.
I'm ready to go.
- Where are you off to?
- I'm giving Daphne a lift.
I'm meeting me friends for darts and a few pints.
It's best in that order.
Just ask Blind Willie, the bartender.
Before you go, I'd like to ask you a little question.
When you look at me, do you see me as a young man or as an older man?
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not getting me into that Vietnam.
There are three questions you never answer honestly: "How old do I look"?
, "Do you like me hair"?
, and "Was it good for you, too"?
Coming, Dr Crane?
Dr Crane?
I'm sorry, I was someplace else.
It was a warm and friendly place.
Big surprise, I got a headache.
I need to get an aspirin.
The very suggestion that I'm descending into old age Just because I can't remember some names and a tune on the piano.
Your arm's not long enough for that, is it?
Let me ask you a few questions.
Can you get through the night without having to go to the john?
Can you get in and out of a chair without going, "Arrrgh"?
Can you eat a slice of pizza less than twelve hours before you go to bed?
- What's on the pizza?
- Ah, I thought so.
Now that we've established you're middle-aged, take some advice.
Don't fight it.
It'll go a lot easier.
Are you suggesting I'll rush off to a surgeon for an eye lift and a chin tuck?
Oh, dear God!
When guys get to this stage, they do things they would never have done before.
Dad, please spare me.
I am a psychiatrist, - I know the routine.
- Who is that?
That's me, in '74, going through my own little stage.
I died my hair black, bought a leather jacket and a Harley Davidson.
My God, Dad, you look like one of the Village People.
I came to my senses before you got back from Harvard that summer.
- Are those love beads?
- All right, that's enough.
Just keep your guard up, and don't do something stupid, all right?
- OK, Dad.
- You might think it's tough being middle-aged, but think about me.
I got a son who's middle-aged.
'I heard that.
' Didn't this use to be Pinsky's store?
- No idea.
- We'd bring you kids here all the time.
Man, it was a great store.
You could buy lingerie, a bag of popcorn and transmission fluid, all under the same roof.
Finally something I'm glad I forgot.
I believe I came here on a mission.
I don't want anything fancy or that comes in tubes.
I want them white, plain and boxers.
That kind of lack of imagination sunk the British Empire.
Check out these dress pants.
They got elastic panels in the waist.
You can eat all you want and not cut off your circulation.
Milan must be beside itself.
An innovative use of synthetic fibres.
You can recycle these and turn them into milk containers.
You going to get them or not?
You brought these over for me?
The sands of time are shifting, mostly south.
Maybe you could go with suspenders.
If you keep your jacket closed, your gut can hang down to here.
I do not have a gut!
I have contours.
Excuse me.
Is anyone helping you?
Oh, no!
She's looking at something with stripes!
Daphne!
Come on, let's go!
You're not getting those, are you?
I have something much better here.
What do you think of these?
They could work on a nice tall guy like you.
- You really think so?
- Yeah, you've got a great build.
- Thank you very much, uh - Carrie.
- Carrie.
- Let's see.
This is kind of a young look, but you could really pull it off.
I don't really think it's me.
Are you sure?
This would look good on you.
I could try it on.
But just out of curiosity, how old do you think I am?
- I don't want to do that.
- No, please.
Go ahead.
I don't know, um 36?
Are you serious?
Sorry, you're probably 34.
Now you don't want to buy anything.
Are those Armani shirts expensive?
- Yeah.
- I'll take two.
- Great.
Changing room's right this way.
- Ah.
I love to guess what my customers do by what they wear.
- You're an architect, right?
- No, I'm a psychiatrist.
Oh, I've taken psychology courses.
What are you, Freudian, Reichian?
Lately, I've been leaning more towards Jung because I'm "jung" at heart.
The oldest joke in the shrinks' book.
- Can't believe I said it.
- I can't believe I laughed.
You must laugh at all customers' jokes.
No, just the cute ones.
- Cute jokes or customers?
- You figure it out.
- You ready?
- I'm trying on some pants.
Did you notice that girl that helped us?
Sure.
I'm not dead.
We just had a little conversation, and I could swear she was flirting with me.
Trust me, Son, she's on commission.
Oh, no, that was no sales pitch.
She is definitely interested in me.
I'll have to see where this may lead.
I know you're forgetting things, but don't you remember our little talk?
Oh, dear, it sneaks right up on you, doesn't it?
What am I thinking?
A 41 -year-old man going out with a girl of 22, 23?
- Young enough to be your daughter.
- Thanks for pointing that out.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL talk radio thanking you for joining us today.
Up next, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco and the "Gonzo Sports Show"!
Until tomorrow, here's wishing you good mental health.
Hey, Doc.
Hear the news?
Ken Griffey Jr's groin pull is healed!
Thank God.
We'll all remember where we were when we heard the joyful news.
- Excuse me, Dr Crane?
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi, I have your pants.
- Whoa, Doc!
- Where'd you leave them?
- They're new.
Finer stores deliver garments to their customers.
We don't.
I just wanted to see you again.
Excuse me.
You look very familiar.
Didn't I let you pour a flaming tequila shooter down my throat at Sloppy Nick's during last year's Indy 500?
- Er, no.
- What you doing next Memorial Day?
As certain as I am that any young lady would love to set your face on fire, Carrie is here to see me.
You can't blame a dog for trying.
Just on the off chance it might make a difference, I drive a '94 Camaro.
Is he gay?
I've been studying about this.
It seems like he's overcompensating.
I'm not sure, but I look forward to running that theory by him.
Thank you for the pants.
Do I owe you anything?
No, I enjoyed meeting you yesterday, and we had a few laughs together.
And maybe we could go out and have a cup of coffee sometime.
Listen, Carrie, I'm very flattered that you'd like to go out with me, and you're a beautiful young woman - But?
- Well, it's our ages.
How old are you?
That's not polite.
It wouldn't be appropriate for us to date.
How about we just live together?
I'm just lightening an uncomfortable moment.
- Ha-ha, well done.
- Well, I'm sorry, but if you change your mind, you know where I am.
- Enjoy your pants.
- Same to you.
I only got a second here, but HELLO!
ANYONE THERE?
She wanted to go out with you!
You didn't have to chase her!
You didn't have to harass her.
You didn't have to pay her!
It was like a miracle!
- She's too young!
- Are you following this?
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't.
You're not dating her?
- No.
- Good.
Maybe I can catch up with her.
Maybe she's never dated an ex-pro hockey player.
You've never played hockey.
It's like we're from different planets.
- Talk about pathetic.
- Isn't he?
- I meant you.
- You think I should go out with her?
It's hard enough to find somebody.
When an opportunity comes along, grab it.
- What about the age thing?
- What about it?
You see an old man in the street with a young girl, what do you think?
I think he must be really rich.
- Then I try to make eye contact.
- Ah.
There you are, Frasier.
I'm so glad you called me.
Thanks for coming.
Maris's friends introduced me to a party game I'd like to share with you - I'd really like to talk.
- This first.
It's a hoot.
If you were on a desert island with one meal, one aria and one bottle of wine, what would they be?
- Niles, I really - Frasier.
OK.
A Big Mac, "I'm Your Venus" and Ripple.
If you're going to mock the game, don't play.
- Gladly.
- Are you still cramped up about age?
No, I'm fine.
By the way, you were right.
Oh, I love to hear that.
Yes, but I do have a problem.
The other day I was asked out by, er, this 22-year-old girl that I met in the mall.
- That is alarming.
- I turned her down.
In a mall?
Did anyone see you?
Niles.
I'm just wondering if I made the right decision.
I would love to go out with this girl.
She's fantastic.
But I could look like some old fool chasing after a young girl, becoming a walking midlife crisis cliché, running around like that buffoon Stanley Barrister.
- Oh, that is embarrassing.
- That girl, how old can she be?
- 21, if she's a day.
- Frightening!
I saw them last Tuesday night together.
- I saw them Wednesday morning.
-  Ew!
- That's disgusting!
- People will say the same about me!
Stanley Barrister is a 60-year-old man who wears a toupee that looks like something he pulled out of a shower drain.
You are 41 and obviously not wearing a toupee.
Thank you, Niles.
- You think it's OK for me to date her?
- It doesn't matter.
- I value your opinion.
- It's irrelevant.
Don't be coy, and please stop pursing your lips.
You look like one of those old women they carve out of dried apples.
Don't you see?
What I think about you dating a younger woman is immaterial.
- What matters is what you think.
- Hm Would you be doing it to run away from your age or because this could become a relationship?
- I don't know.
- Find out.
- Then to hell with what people think.
- You are right.
Oh!
There it is again.
I never tire of hearing that.
Let the tongues of the doubting nabobs wag.
- If it feels right, make yourself happy.
- Thank you.
On a desert island, what would be your favourite meal, aria and wine?
The coulibiac of salmon at Guy Savoy, "Vissi d'arte" from Tosca, and the Cotes du Rhone Chateauneuf du Pape '47.
You are so predictable.
- Carrie, hi.
- Hi.
I didn't expect to see you here.
I could say I came down to shop, but I came to see you.
That's great.
I've been thinking about you.
Me, too.
I wanted to chat about why we shouldn't go out.
- OK.
- I thought I was in a midlife crisis.
I was afraid if I dated you, I would be trying to recapture my youth.
I thought I asked you out only because I was trying to work out some unresolved issues about my father or something.
So I went back and forth.
I felt like a fool Me, too, back and forth.
- Maybe you came along to fill a need.
- Or this could be something serious.
Exactly.
So, well, I asked myself a few tough questions.
- Me, too.
- I finally came to a decision.
Me, too.
I think us going out would have been really stupid.
Me, too!
You and I would never have been on a very firm footing.
You knew all that, but you just let me figure it out for myself.
Yes, I'm sort of like the Wizard of Oz.
It's no wonder everybody listens to your radio show.
You're so smart.
Actually, I am full of crap.
I had no idea you might be grappling with personal issues.
Some psychiatrist, huh?
The truth is I came down here to try to talk you into going out with me.
I guess it's still a pretty bad idea.
You're being so honest with me.
That is such an attractive quality in a man.
Well, you know, let's not go down that road again.
OK.
See you around.
Bye.
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # Maybe I seem a bit confused Yeah, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face What is a boy to do?

{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, look, Roz, my brochures are here!
Oh, God, very exciting!
Vacation!
The Golden Door Spa!
Look at those accommodations.
That is nice!
I'll leave Dad to fend for himself, while I spend an obscene amount being pampered like a child.
What else are vacations for?
What are you doing for your week off?
Oh, I'm taking my mom to Ireland to stay in the hovel where her mother was born.
Just write the words "bad son" on my forehead!
You deserve to pamper yourself.
After all, you do work three hours a day.
I'm sorry, that one even surprised me.
When I think of the relationship I have with my dad, I envy the relationship you have with your mother.
It didn't just happen.
We work at it.
We spend time together.
Dad lives with me.
How much more time together could we spend?
Day-to-day living is different.
There is nothing better than taking a trip together.
You get to relax.
You get to see a different side of him.
In his entire life, my dad has never been to Europe.
It would be a way of connecting with him if I gave him that.
What would you charge me to take him to Ireland with you?
I should have known this would happen.
I always throw out my back when I try to lift Maris's luggage.
- Why didn't you hire a skycap?
- We did for most of it.
She won't trust strangers with her make-up case, ever since a porter dropped it and broke three vials of rare Swiss lamb placenta.
On the up side, the calfskin lining was never more soft and supple.
Where did Mrs Crane go?
She's making her annual pilgrimage to the holy land.
Thought she was in Dallas, at her sister's.
That is her holy land.
The site of the first Nieman Marcus.
- Oh, Dr Crane!
- Oh, call me Niles!
Thank you, Daphne.
Dad, I have a really exciting idea.
I want to take you on vacation!
- Why?
- I thought an adventure might give us a chance to have fun, get reacquainted, even do a little bonding.
- What did you have in mind?
- It's not about where I want to go.
It's about where YOU want to go.
Dad, I give you the world.
The Gallie-pagos Islands, huh?
Where iguanas, sea lions and giant tortoises live in eternal harmony.
Is it important they get along?
No, I suppose not.
Oh, how about this?
India and Nepal!
"Trek the foothills of the Himalayas".
- You're forgetting my old pal.
- No problem.
Frasier can hire a Sherpa to carry you on his back.
They don't mind.
We haven't struck the right chord yet, but we will.
- You suggest something.
- You really want to go with me?
Yes, I do.
I'll go anywhere you want to!
- OK!
- I may not be as sophisticated as you, but I'd like to see America first.
Great!
We'll see America!
- And I want to see it in a Winnebago.
- A Winnebago!
- That has a real ring to it!
- Your mother and I dreamed about it.
Then that is the trip we're going to take.
- You really mean it?
- Absolutely.
- This calls for a celebration.
- Let's pop open a couple of beers.
I think I got a bag of pork rinds in here, too.
Ah, the final touch!
I almost feel like I'm in a trailer park already!
Oh, Winnebago boy!
Hang beach chairs on the back, and give it a name like "The Whoopin' Cranes"!
When I agreed to see America with Dad, I thought it'd be five-star resorts.
By "together" I meant adjoining suites!
- Tell him it's a bad idea.
- I can't.
He counts on it.
He was going to go with Mom.
Yes, but she lucked out and died!
Niles, listen.
If Dad and I get into a Winnebago, only one of us will come out alive.
- You've got to come too.
- You're my brother.
You're entitled to my bone marrow and a kidney, but this is an imposition.
You got to come with us.
Frasier and I have nothing to talk about.
I feel more comfortable with somebody else around.
- Why did you suggest it?
- It sounded good when I said it.
But thinking about it Can you see me and Frasier together all day, then crawling into bunks at night, lying head to head in the dark, bonding?
I'll pay you.
I got pension money.
I remember a car trip when I was nine.
We drove from Seattle to Spokane.
All he said to me was, "I think we got a problem with your brother Frasier".
Those were awful, those driving vacations.
Dad insisting on covering as many miles as possible, the two of us tiny hostages in the back seat, clutching our car-sickness bags, straining to see something as the landscape whizzed by.
I was 13 before I realised cows aren't blurry.
- Just tell him you don't want to go.
- I don't want to disappoint him.
I don't want to disappoint him.
I'm sorry, Frasier.
I am not a Winnebago person.
When I see one, I look into the driver's eyes, hoping to see something that explains why in God's name he wants to do this.
All I see is a death stare under a hat made of Miller Lite cans.
This is my final word: I'm not going.
- Daphne's coming too!
- And so am I!
It's everything I hoped, only better!
It's like sitting in your lounge, watching TV, except it isn't TV, it's America!
Yes, Dad, it's the ultimate in reality programming - actual reality.
We got a turn-off in five miles, so start slowing down.
- I know.
- How does it feel behind that wheel?
Manly.
This is mine and it's big!
God, it's like being sealed upright in a Formica coffin!
When they were kids, all they had in the back seat was a mayonnaise jar.
Yes.
It took quite a bit of skill to use it successfully at 70 miles an hour.
Never been fond of mayonnaise since.
Or speed bumps.
Turn-off's coming up in four miles.
Get ready.
You're OK on the right.
It's never too early to move over.
Dad, I was wondering what inspired you to choose that uniquely American man-made wonder, Mount Rushmore?
It's obvious.
We got a week off, right?
That's as far as we can go in 31/2 days.
We get there, get out, walk around, drive back.
Boom!
Another fine landmark under our belts.
You've certainly got this well planned.
When I take a holiday, I just grab a change of knickers and see where the wind takes me.
Niles.
Niles!
What Daphne's saying is what we should really be doing.
- What are you talking about?
- Why be so beholden to schedules?
We Americans are enchanted with the romance of the open highway.
Jack Kerouac went "On The Road".
Buzz and Todd got their kicks on Route 66.
The adventure is in the journey.
We should just ramble.
Doggone it, I'm inspired!
I'm going to put on a baseball cap.
- You'll miss the turn-off!
- So?
- We'll get lost!
- We're in a house on wheels!
- We're always home!
- It's coming up!
Turn here!
This is it!
Turn!
Turn here!
- We missed it!
- Dad, we didn't miss anything!
Oh, my God!
We're now on the road less travelled.
From now on, we dance to the rhythm of the road.
There must be an access road back onto that turn-off.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Oh, it's always in the crack!
So is life, Dad.
I was anxious, but I'm starting to like this free spirit stuff.
Dad, there's an historical marker up ahead.
Let's stop.
- Driving wherever you feel like it.
- It's educational.
There!
There!
There!
There!
- What did it say?
- No idea.
The only word I saw was "legendary".
Look, a roadside stand.
Fresh fruit, home-made cider!
-  Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
- Oh!
You're missing the freewheeling concept.
We go where the wind blows us.
It's blowing, we're going.
Why are you moaning?
You're obsessed with covering distance.
- It's the way I relax.
Hey, watch it!
I got my kids in the car!
Whoa!
Your "relaxing" seems like an obsession.
Don't you think so, Niles?
Niles, what are you doing?
Making a vacation video we can look at over and over and over again.
OK.
You guys want to stop so bad, we'll stop.
See that sign?
"Have your picture taken with a live grizzly.
Souvenirs one mile".
I always wanted my picture taken with a bear.
Some dreams cannot be denied.
OK, Dad, you're good on my side.
It's never too early to change lane.
Oh, my God!
It must be genetic.
Get your dog away from my bear.
I just had him cleaned.
He's stuffed.
- Your sign said a "live" bear.
- It's an old sign.
Look at that view!
It's like we're really there!
If we were, we'd be whizzing by it at 50 mph.
It's the gourmet food department.
- Home-made deer jerky!
- "No sampling".
- No problem.
- Would you take our picture, please?
Niles, Frasier, come on up here.
OK.
Here we go.
Everybody ready?
- Now, what should we do?
- How about this?
That's great!
I like that.
OK, everybody.
- Eddie!
- You know it's $10 Canadian.
- For a treasured memory, what's money?
- OK.
One - Why Canadian dollars?
Because we're in Canada.
We're in Canada?
We crossed the border a while ago.
You were taking a nap.
But I can't be in Canada!
I'm not allowed to leave the States.
- Why?
- I don't have me green card yet!
Oh, this is just perfect!
Three months till me final interview.
The one thing they told me was not to leave the country.
And the first time I fall asleep, you drag me across the border!
- They won't let me back in!
- They have to.
It's not your fault.
If only you hadn't been so hell-bent on driving far!
You had to go where the wind blows!
Never mind whose fault it is.
I'm stuck here.
What am I going to do?
We'll explain to the authorities.
I'm sure this happens all the time.
- Get real.
They got rules.
- Then what's your solution?
- We'll sneak her across the border.
- That's called smuggling.
Thanks, Niles!
I knew it was something bad guys did.
I didn't know the technical term.
You, a former policeman, suggest we commit a felony?
I've crossed this border plenty.
Most of the time the guards wave you through.
- Let's get out of here.
- What if they pull us over?
Daphne has to convince them she's American.
It beats having me bum bounced back across the pond.
- Let's give it a bash.
- Oh, yes, this is foolproof!
I'm about to defraud the US lmmigration Department.
So is my father, my older brother.
People who should be my role models.
I'm the product of a bad environment.
If the guard asks you a question can you say anything - - in an American accent?
-  Sure.
- OK, what?
- You heard it.
- What?
- Sure.
That's all I can say.
I need a cup of tea.
Tea?
Why not wave a crumpet in the air and sing "God Save the Queen"?
You're a psychiatrist.
You should be in control of your emotions.
Oh, my God, there's the border!
All right.
Now calm down.
We're gonna be fine.
Remember, they'll be looking for suspicious behaviour.
Niles, that qualifies.
If the guard pokes his head in here, what will he see?
Four carefree Americans.
- I've never been so nervous.
- There isn't any need to be.
They're waving everybody through without any questions!
Please, please!
They're waving us through.
They're waving us through!
They're pulling us over!
They're pulling us over!
The guard.
I can't do this.
It's going to be fine.
Just keep your answers short.
Guilty people always talk too much.
- Hi, folks.
Enjoyed Canada?
-  Great!
What was the purpose of your trip?
Fun.
I see.
- Where were you born?
- Seattle, Washington.
You want to know what country.
America, of course!
I'm quite an American.
I always vote for the law and order guy That's fine, I don't need any more detail.
And you, miss?
Enjoy Canada?
Sure.
And the weather?
Sure.
Sure.
- Is this your vehicle?
- No.
Yes, well, I rented it.
It's American-made.
I always look for that union label.
- I need your licence and registration.
- It's right here.
The registration Let me get my licence out for you.
Here we are.
Stay right here.
Well, I certainly can depend on my gang, can't I?
- I'm going to be arrested!
- We're all getting arrested.
But I have delicate features.
Prison will be hell for me.
Cool it, Niles.
It's too late to turn back.
I say we make a run for it.
Oh, great idea!
A high-speed chase in an eight-ton motor home!
An amusing anecdote for the border guard newsletter.
Shut up.
Keep babbling like this, they'll catch us for sure.
He's coming back.
Well, these check out.
We're all strictly on the up and up.
Miss, you've been very quiet.
Is there something I should know here?
You seem awfully nervous.
May I have your name, please?
Aw, all right.
I should have known better than to try this.
- It was wrong!
- Just back off.
What is it, sir?
We were trying to put one over on you.
Eddie!
- We don't have a rabies certificate.
- I knew something was going on here.
We weren't planning on coming, and at the border, we forgot.
I didn't know you needed one.
But ignorance of the law is no defence, so take the little dog away and we'll be off.
If you're worried, we picked the dog up here in Canada.
I got a picture I can show you.
Here's a picture of him taken at the Seattle Space Needle.
- I see you got a badge there.
- Oh, yeah!
- Are you a policeman?
- Retired.
Thirty years on the Force.
I should know better.
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.
Sure.
Next time, remember the rabies certificate.
Have a safe trip.
- Thanks, Officer.
- Thank you.
Drive!
Oh, they'd have returned you eventually!
- How long till we get home?
- Two hours.
This highway goes right into Seattle.
- Why don't you take a nap?
- Oh, no, I'm OK.
- Thought maybe we'd chat a little.
- Oh, yeah, great.
I can't help it.
When we're alone, I don't know what to say.
That's why I asked Daphne to come.
I had my suspicions, but I'd hoped that wasn't the case.
Knock it off.
That's why you asked Niles.
That's why I asked him, but that's not why he came.
Well, the funny thing is we didn't have such a bad time, did we?
"I see you got a badge there".
"Oh, yeah"!
- Pretty slick, huh?
- Yeah.
There's no reason to cut our trip short.
We're not that far from Yellowstone.
- I always wanted to see Old Faithful.
- Me, too.
If you want a real adventure, we could drop these two off home first.
- Just the two of us, alone?
- Yeah!
- Just you and me, father and son?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you and me, camping in Yellowstone, all alone.
All by ourselves!
Well, it'd be a shame if Daphne didn't get to see those Indian paint pots.
- Of course.
- They are a real miracle of nature.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wouldn't be fair to leave Niles alone.
- Maris out of town, that'd be cruel.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- How far is it to Yellowstone?
- We'll be there tomorrow.
It'd be a nice surprise for those two when they wake up.
I got a better surprise.
Let's tell Daphne we're in Mexico!
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again Good night, Seattle, we love you.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Here you go, Doc Your usual.
How lovely it is to have a usual.
- What is this?
- Latte with nutmeg and cinnamon.
That's my brother's usual.
I'm the double Kona with cream.
Oh, Frasier - am I glad to see you.
- Your usual, Doc?
- Please.
Thank you.
Niles, you seem more than usually agitated today.
A problem?
I'm meeting my publisher here.
Remember my book deal you envied?
I wasn't jealous, Niles.
Well, the deal's about to be killed.
My idea had already been done.
I need to find an alternative today and I've got bubkis - less than bubkis.
I've got what bubkis keeps for lint in the bottom of his pocket.
- Can you ask for an extension?
- No, I've had two already.
Oh, God, there he is.
Sam, so good to see you.
- Niles.
- Sam Tanaka, Dr Frasier Crane.
Nice to meet you.
- Coffee?
- I'll have what he's having.
So you shall.
One more, please.
- Wait, you're the doctor from the radio.
- Guilty as charged.
- I listen to your show all the time.
- Oh, thank you.
I never realized you two were brothers.
All our lives!
You must have incredible insight into sibling relationships.
No more than your average psychiatrist brothers.
So, Niles, what's your idea?
My idea - well, Sam, I've given it a lot of thought - There may be a book in that.
- In what?
Two psychiatrist brothers writing about sibling relationships.
That, Sam, is exactly the idea we were going to pitch to you!
- What?
!
- Terrific!
I hate to interrupt Gentlemen, I'm going to cancel my lunch date so I can take you two out to celebrate.
Oh, well, we were going to write today, but OK.
What are you doing?
I don't wanna write a book.
I'm outta here.
Frasier, I know it's asking a big favour, All my life I have dreamed of one thing - the day I could go into a library and see my name under "mental illness".
The day I could finally feel what you feel - that I'm somebody, not just one more dusty little psychiatrist.
Oh, Niles We haven't collaborated since the spring musicale in prep school.
Yes, well, it was well received.
It did get us out of gym class.
- It could be like that again.
- I don't know, Niles.
# Um-ta, um-ta, um-ta, da-da-da-da # Oh, some boys go to college But we think they're all wussies # Cos they get all the knowledge And we get all the Um-ta, um-ta # - All right, I'll do it!
- Yes!
- Dumas frére!
- Dumas frére!
- Hello, what are you doing over here?
- It's our first writing session.
- I thought that was at Niles's house.
- Unfortunately, it's Maris's turn to host her sherry-tasting group and things get a little raucous.
- But the Sonics are on in 20 minutes.
- I bought you these headphones.
You'll be able to listen to the TV without disturbing Niles and me.
How's Eddie gonna hear?
He can read about the game in tomorrow's paper.
Try them out there.
Hey, not bad!
- Very clever solution.
- It also has another little feature.
Watch this.
Hey, Dad Nice shirt  Did they throw that in the last time you had your tyres rotated  Tell us about when you met Eisenhower.
We haven't heard that story this hour  OK.
My turn.
Hey, Dad Say another word and I'll club you both with my cane.
This is great, thanks a lot.
Watch out for this for me, Eddie.
I got to get a snack.
Who wants a beer?
Just you.
This is no time to procrastinate.
OK, here we go.
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.
I'm indenting!
I hate to squash your enthusiasm, but shouldn't we discuss what the book is going to be about?
Forgive me for just barrelling ahead, but damn it, I'm jazzed!
We have to approach this book from a completely different angle than all of our previous writing - our dissertations, our theses.
Right.
This has to be interesting.
The obvious approach is case histories.
Anecdotes about siblings we've dealt with in our practice.
If we throw in a few heaving bosoms we'll make Book of the Month Club.
I could tell you a couple of stories about you guys.
That's an interesting idea.
We'll use ourselves in the introduction.
I like the introduction idea.
Give us your best story - the one with little Niles and little Frasier at their conflicted best.
When we went trout fishing, you guys were at it tooth and nail.
- This is good.
- What's the lake called?
The name is immaterial.
It's an Indian word, Lake Watchahatchee?
- You're missing the point.
- Your mother knew but she's dead.
Watchakootchie?
Coochawatchie?
It was an Indian word.
- It meant "land of a thousand" - Dad This is driving me nuts.
I have to look it up.
- We just want the story.
- Where the hell did I put my atlas?
- Quite a resource, isn't he  - We'll just put the introduction on hold.
Back to case histories.
I suppose I could get my files out of storage after the Niles, is there a light bulb over my head?
- You have an idea?
- No, is there actually a light bulb  Of course I have an idea!
What better source than my show?
I'll ask listeners to call in with stories of sibling conflict and you can be my guest.
You're suggesting we exploit your listeners for our own gain?
In essence, yes.
- What do you think?
- It's borderline sleazy.
Go for it.
Hello, Roz.
- What's your brother doing here?
- He's going to be my guest.
I don't think so.
I am the producer, and I approve the guests.
I do not approve him.
- OK, bye-bye, have a good show.
- OK, he's approved.
But I will not get him coffee and I'm not taking any of his crapola.
Niles, welcome aboard.
Five seconds to air.
OK, Niles - sit down, take a deep breath, try not to spit on the mike.
Right.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I have a very special guest today, my brother, the eminent psychiatrist Dr Niles Crane.
Hello, emerald city!
What's doin', what's happenin'?
What do you think you're doing?
That was my radio persona.
Every great radio personality has one.
- I don't.
- My point exactly.
Just try to be yourself.
Our topic today is siblings - what makes you love them, hate them What things do they do to annoy you?
These could be things from your childhood or adolescence, - your young adulthood - or They could be things that are going on right now!
- Roz, who's our first caller?
- Donald from Bainbridge Island.
He hasn't spoken to his brother in 20 years.
- Hello, Donald, I'm listening.
We're listening.
'I'll never forget it.
I cried for two hours straight.
' So you were completely bald?
'Yes, the perm destroyed my hair.
' 'I was sure my sisters were gonna laugh at me but they all kissed me.
'Then they shaved their heads too, so I wouldn't feel like a freak.
' Amazing!
Well, there you have it, Seattle - the miracle of the sibling relationship spelled out in an unselfish act of head-shaving.
Time's up.
I'd like to thank my brother for being here today.
Niles, I would shave my head for you.
A gesture which becomes less significant with each passing year.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'll be back tomorrow - one Crane flying solo.
Frasier, we've hit the mother lode.
We've material here for two volumes.
I apologize for criticizing your radio programme.
All water under the Pont Neuf.
I hate to break this up but there's a Sam Tanaka on line one.
- Hello, Sam, you're on speakerphone.
- 'I caught the show today, fellows.
' You did?
And?
'Magic!
- 'How's the writing coming?
' - Flowing like water.
We've got two or three chapters already.
'That's good because I just got off the phone with "Reader's Digest".
'They're interested in the serialization rights.
'I need first few chapters to give them a taste.
Can you fax them?
' Well, Sam, uh, of course we could, but they're a little rough.
'No problem.
You've got till Friday to polish them up.
'You can do that, right?
' - Absolutely.
- Friday's fine.
'Terrific!
I love you guys!
' What are we gonna do?
We just have to put the material together.
- It's due on Friday.
- Then we'll do it by FRIDAY!
Wait.
George and Ira Gershwin would lock themselves in a hotel room and not come out until their task was complete.
Brilliant!
After this volume we can write another chorus to "Bess, You Is My Woman Now".
It's clean, it's Spartan, totally devoid of charm.
- It's perfect.
Let's get to work.
- I'm with you, mon frére.
We cannot be intimidated by the tyranny of the blank page.
All we need to get a good start here - is room service!
- Frasier!
All right.
All we need is a good opening sentence - something that will smack the reader right between the eyes and take him on a roller coaster ride of self-awareness and discovery.
Frasier, while you're mixing metaphors, I've had a breakthrough.
Voilá!
Our opening sentence "From Romulus and Remus to the Lennon sisters, "sibling relationships have sparked psychological debate worldwide".
- Hmm Interesting.
- You like it?
I said it was interesting.
The question is whether we'd like an interesting opening or a good one.
- Just because you didn't think of it.
- I never liked Romulus or Remus, and the "Lennon sisters" reference is from the freaking moon.
If you can do better, be my guest.
- I will.
- All right.
My fingers are poised over the keys.
I'm waiting.
I'm still waiting.
Oh, all right.
Put this down.
"The key to a good sibling relationship "is the ability to be open and honest".
- That actually sounded good to me.
- Well, put that in there.
"The key to a good sibling relationship is the ability to be open and honest "while still respecting each other's boundaries".
What are you doing?
What was that crap about boundaries?
I was just finishing the thought.
The thought was finished.
It didn't need finishing.
- I think it's better this way.
- I don't.
- I'm at the keyboard.
- Let me type.
- I need the keyboard.
- You ruined a good opening sentence!
- It was an incomplete thought.
- Oh, YOU'RE an incomplete thought!
- What happened to the iced tea?
- I finished that, too.
Niles, I've just had an epiphany.
Oh, wonderful - we could use a second sentence  No, it's not for the book.
I just realized why so many writers become bloated, alcoholic suicides.
No, don't type that in.
I'm not.
I'm adding up our tab from the mini-bar.
- We now owe $232.
- Oh, dear God!
Well, you ate the jar of Macadamia nuts.
No, it's dawn!
It's Friday!
Admit it.
We can't work together.
There's never gonna be any book.
- Not with that attitude.
- Oh, get off it!
The fat lady has sung.
The curtain has been rung down.
I'll type it for you.
"It's oover"?
Let's go home.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd give up so easily.
It's not your dream.
Why should it be, Mr Big-shot Radio Host?
Oh, is that what this tantrum is about?
You're jealous of my celebrity?
It's not a tantrum and I'm not jealous.
I'm just FED UP!
Fed up with always being second.
I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom way before you did, but you were older.
You got married first.
You had a child first.
By the time I get around to doing anything it's all chewed meat!
- It's something we can't change.
- Oh, you love it!
- Oh, let it go, Niles.
- My nose is rubbed in it every day.
I'm on the board of the Psychiatric Association.
Four of my patients have been elected to political office.
But it's your big, fat face they put on the side of buses!
I do not have a FAT FACE!
I keep wondering how long you're gonna store those nuts for winter.
Well, at least I'm not spindly!
- Who're you calling spindly?
- You!
- Fat face!
- Spindly!
- You take that back!
- You make me!
I will!
Here's making you!
Here's your fat face!
Give me that!
Niles!
Niles!
Stop it!
We're psychiatrists, not pugilists!
I can't believe you fell for that!
My God, I'm having a flashback!
You're climbing in my crib and jumping on me!
YOU STOLE MY MOMMY!
Oh, my God, Niles!
I got to get out of here.
This entire idea has been a fiasco.
I should have never agreed.
Goodbye!
- Good morning, all.
- Morning.
- You seem chipper.
- And why shouldn't I be?
Well, it's gonna rain, the jobless rate's up, and Eddie was just licking that muffin.
DOORBELL I'll get it.
A mature man knows he cannot control his circumstances, - only his response.
- You talked to your brother yet?
I do not have a brother!
I'm an only child.
Oh, hello, Dr Crane.
Hello, Daphne Dad.
What are you doing here?
Dad, I would like you to convey a message from me to Frasier.
What makes you think I know where he is?
He owes me half this hotel bill.
I will accept no cheques.
I know he has trouble writing things  - I'm not paying any of this.
- So, you're cheap and stupid.
- And you're a no-talent hack!
- And you look stupid in a T-shirt!
All right, that's enough.
Sit down and listen to me.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I never had a brother, but I had a partner once - Mitch Gossett.
Big bear of a guy, arms like tree trunks.
We'd go to ball games.
We played cards, and this was after working all day together.
- That's nice, but - Just listen to me.
Three months into our partnership, Goss and I got assigned to a stakeout - three days in the front of a Chevy Nova, drinking too much coffee.
Pretty soon we started getting on each other's nerves.
Because he was a big, egotistical fat face?
Because we were human.
He didn't like this about me, I didn't like that about him.
It got ugly.
When the stakeout ended, Goss requested a transfer, and that was fine by me.
Three months later, he was stabbed breaking up a bar fight.
By the time I got to the hospital, it was too late.
Take what you want from this story, boys.
All I know is, it ain't worth it.
Excuse me.
I think I need a hanky.
Frasier, isn't there something you want to say to your brother?
Yes, Dad, I suppose there is.
Niles, would you like a muffin?
- Frasier!
- Oh, all right.
Niles, I'm sorry things didn't work out with the book.
You have no reason to feel inferior to me.
You're an accomplished psychiatrist, a decent man, and you stand second to no one.
Thank you, Frasier.
The truth is, I've always looked up to you and admired you.
Enough of this mushy, girly stuff.
Just shake hands, punch each other on the shoulder and be done with it.
- Oh, what the heck!
- Oh, jeez!
- What are you crying about?
- I keep thinking about poor Goss.
It must be so hard on you carrying all that pain around.
There was no Goss.
I made him up.
Well, at least there's one good writer in this family.
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy!
# And, maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again Good night, everybody!

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I'm sorry, Blake.
When I told you to close your eyes and imagine you're on an island, I didn't realise you were calling from your car phone.
'That's OK, Doc.
At least I know my airbags work.
' Well, I'm glad you're all right.
Thank you for your call.
Oh, look who's just popped into the booth.
It's Gil Chesterton, KACL's own food critic.
Which means it's my cue to hit the road.
So until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you a good day.
And and good health.
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hello, Gil.
I heard you coughing on the air.
Are you coming down with something?
I got you this from Rosenthal's deli.
Chicken soup so lovingly prepared even the chicken gets well.
That's very kind.
Of course, I'd never forget you, Roz.
Ladyfingers soaked in rum.
Much like her own.
I hope this isn't the start of that nasty flu that's going around.
If you want to take a couple of days off, I'll cover your time slot.
- No, thank you.
I'll be fine tomorrow.
- Okey-dokey.
But feel free to call me if you change your mind.
Mmm Plump, gooey and guaranteed to rot your teeth.
Yes.
I don't like his phoney British accent much, either.
You sure got a bug up your mike about Gil.
Nobody's that nice unless they want something.
- He's just generous.
- He was generous to Bonnie Weems.
He bought her wine asking for her time slot while she was on vacation.
Then she was banished to the midnight-to-4am-slot.
- He's after our time slot?
- We should watch our backs.
Working from midnight to 4:00 am would ruin your social life.
Those are your peak hours.
- You're just paranoid.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
The man just brought you chicken soup.
He'd be bribing the higher-ups.
They make the decisions.
Oh, Frasier.
Oh, good, it's still here.
I'm so sorry.
This is your soup.
This is the lobster Newburg I bought for the station manager's cat.
I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
This is gruesome!
A partly decomposed body just washed up in Puget Sound.
- That's good news.
- Pardon?
Bodies don't rise till the weather gets warmer.
You get your first floater, and spring's just around the corner.
Morning.
- You sound awful!
- It's just a little bug.
But you can't go to work.
You're all pasty and clammy and pale.
And coming from an English person, that's bad.
You often said, "If you can walk, you can work".
Took an ironic twist the day you got shot in the hip.
At least I had a real job.
Half your listeners hear voices already or talk to themselves.
If you don't show up, who's going to notice?
I'm out of here.
But you really should stay home and let me tend to you.
I'm a good nurse.
I mended my brothers' soccer injuries.
- I didn't play soccer.
- Neither did my hooligan brothers.
They got hurt beating up drunken Dutchmen.
That'll look pretty against the glass in your booth.
- Why don't you just stay home?
- Thank you, but I am a physician.
I am the best monitor of my condition.
I'm fine.
Fit as a fiddle.
I'm sick!
We're back with "Restaurant Beat".
I'm Gil Chesterton filling in for Dr Crane.
We're talking to Louis.
He's forgotten tonight is his tenth anniversary.
Louis, I believe I've saved your proverbial derriére.
I managed to secure you a private booth at Maximilian's.
Promise me for dessert, you'll have the Schwarzwaldkirschtorte.
-  'The what?
' - Schwarzwaldkirsch Well, maybe you'd better stick with the rainbow sherbet.
- 'Thank you!
You saved my marriage.
' - Don't thank me.
I'm only here because our dear Dr Crane is home with the flu.
'Lf you're listening, Doc, 'all of us at KACL want you to get better soon.
' I bet you do.
Time to check if the turkey's done.
Dad, you needn't sit with me all day.
Oh, no problem.
You need company when you're sick.
You never know when you'll croak.
Oh, boy, your temperature is up there.
Thanks for reminding me.
The sickest I ever was was when they shipped us back from Korea.
I got an oriental parasite.
It was building its own pagoda in my colon.
Thank you, Dad!
You know, you might try some of my homeopathic tea.
It'll flush out your system and make your hair more manageable.
- No, thanks.
- No!
That wasn't the sickest I was.
It was when your mother and I went to Mexico.
I was real careful about the water, but I ate some lettuce.
Next thing you know, I'm spewing both for accuracy and distance.
I spent the night curled up on the floor screaming, "I want to die"!
Wouldn't that have been a tragedy?
You wouldn't be here now.
OK, I get the point.
I'll give you a little peace and quiet here.
Oh, no!
One time, your mother left the potato salad in the trunk of the car.
I'm still sick from that.
- Do you need anything else?
- Some more ginger ale, please.
- Very well.
- Oh, Daphne, make it shaved ice, not cubes, OK?
And I don't like those straws.
Can I have the bendy kind?
And the Saltines, they're too salty.
I need the low-sodium.
Your wish is my command.
Hello, Daphne.
Is he in pain?
Not enough.
Frasier, I brought you something.
Niles!
Put the hanky down, for God's sake!
- It's not the plague!
- All right.
This is from Marta, our maid.
It's a poultice to wear around your neck.
The recipe comes from her remote mountain village in Guatemala.
I can see why her village is remote.
Yes, it is pungent, but it helps many villagers live to be over 100.
Marta herself is 78.
You should see her scramble up the stairs when Maris rings!
- Oh, Niles, would you mind?
- Of course.
Oh, hello, Eddie.
For once, I'm actually glad to see you.
Here you are.
It's for you.
It's Roz?
- Hello?
-  'How do you feel?
' - Awful.
- I'm sorry to hear that because you should get back here.
You were right about Gil, Frasier.
He's lobbying for our slot.
Millie in traffic overheard Gil talking to the station manager, saying our mid-afternoon time slot is perfect for his show because then everyone is making dinner plans.
I knew it!
Geez!
OK, Roz, I'll be there tomorrow.
You better be.
I don't trust that greedy, finger-licking runt.
- How am I doing?
- Fabulous.
OK, I'll be in tomorrow.
You can't be serious about going in tomorrow.
Your pupils are dilated.
You have a fever.
In that condition, you won't make it to the parking lot.
I just don't trust Gil Chesterton.
He's after my time slot.
Oh, Niles, will you stop it with the alcohol?
I can't let that smarmy chowhound do my show for another day.
Anybody would be better.
Niles, would you do my show for me?
That fever is making you delusional.
When you were sick, I met with your "Fear of Intimacy" group.
I wasn't sick.
They were just getting too close.
You're right.
It's a bad idea.
Doing my show requires abilities you don't possess.
You have to be able to size up your patients quickly and dispense advice in an entertaining and insightful manner.
This pathetic attempt at reverse psychology is beneath you.
- Then you won't do it?
- No, I will.
And better than you ever dreamed of doing it!
Here is the cough button in case you need to cough.
And use this extra-long commercial if you need a bathroom break.
Those won't be necessary.
I have no cough reflex and excellent bladder control.
It's true.
All the good ones are married.
You're on soon.
Your first caller is Marcia.
Marcia.
"Hello, Marcia, I'm listening".
That's trite.
"Hello, Marcia.
Tell me where it hurts".
No.
"Hello, Marcia, I hear you".
- Good afternoon, Seattle.
- Oh, yes.
Hello!
This is Dr Niles Crane filling in for my ailing brother, Frasier Crane.
Although I feel qualified to fill Frasier's radio shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, I am a Jungian, so there'll be no blaming mother today.
OK, Roz, who's my first caller?
Marcia.
She's in love with her husband's brother.
This day promises not to disappoint.
Hello, Marcia, let's get better.
'Before we get deeper into your problem, 'why don't I give you a little historical background.
'The psychiatrist Sigmar Brom, that's B-r-o-m, no 'h', 'in the late 1950s, wrote extensively on the problem you're facing, 'which is amazing when you realise Brom was a prominent Reichian.
' He's terrible!
And so are you.
Your temperature's up to 103.
Let it go up to 105.
I couldn't be better.
My time slot is safe.
Niles is as dry as this toast you brought me with the crust still on.
- When I go back, they'll send a limo.
- I'll get you another drink.
- Was that last straw bendy enough?
- Perfect, thank you.
Oh, Daphne Daphne Take these tissues away.
I They hurt my nose.
I want the kind with moisturiser in between the sheets.
The rose petals in the humidifier are wilting.
Oh, of course.
Anything you like.
Fresh rose petals, crustless toast, soft tissues, acupuncture needles where you least expect them.
Howard, Lois, I could counsel you all afternoon, but we're coming to the end of our hour, so I'll make it short.
If one of you doesn't say "I love you" right now, you have no future together.
So which of you has the courage to say "I love you"?
'Howard, I love you.
' Yes!
Yes!
Howard, she loves you!
- What about you?
-  'Uh ' Howard, are you going to pack up your emotional tent and walk away?
Howard?
Howard, it's up to you!
Can you say it?
Can you?
Come on, Howard!
'I I love you, too, Lois!
' - Yes!
- He said it!
He said it!
- Niles is pretty good.
- Good?
The little rat is scintillating.
Why couldn't he do what's expected of him and stink?
He's even better than Gil Chesterton.
They're trying to make me look bad!
Oh, Jesus.
That high temperature is making you zooey.
No, no, it's made me clear-headed!
I must get down to that station and reclaim what's rightfully mine.
There will be no more filling in by anybody!
- No way, no how, no one!
No - You're not going anywhere.
- Who's to stop me?
- I am.
How will you, with a cane, stop a man in the prime of his life?
And I wasn't even leaning on my cane.
- Come on, Daphne.
- He really is sick.
You want to talk sick?
The tilt-a-whirl was right next to the Little Taste of India.
I was out sick this week and I'd like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Gil Chesterton and to my brother Niles for doing such a great job of filling in for me.
I really appreciate it, guys.
Well, now that I'm back to normal and feeling great who's our first caller?
We have Sonja from Auburn on line three.
Let's just hear what Sonja has to say.
Daphne!
Daphne!
- What is it this time?
- I had a dream!
I had a dream!
They are plotting against me!
Now, now.
We went over this already.
It's just your fever talking.
That's what you want me to think.
You're in league with Niles.
I know about the two of you!
You pretend not to know, but you know.
- I must take my show back!
- You barely function!
Run down to the drugstore with these prescriptions.
This will have you high as a kite!
- Only until I take a couple of these.
- I don't think you're in any Thank you, but the moment I give a fig about what you think is the day that England produces a great chef, a world-class bottle of wine, and a car that has a decent electrical system.
Being a healthcare provider I try to be sympathetic towards my patients, but I have reached the end of my tether with you!
You are by far the most ungrateful, disagreeable, self-centred, whiny fusspot I've had the misfortune of dealing with!
I've had patients on their deathbeds who were more considerate and jolly!
As far as I'm concerned, you can lay in those sweaty sheets till you're one giant bedsore!
- Are you done?
- Yes.
Then scurry on down to the drugstore.
Get those filled while I get dressed.
Oh, hello, Frasier!
What a surprise to see you here today!
It's no wonder.
I've taken some wonder drugs.
I feel wonderful!
So, I'm going to go do my show now so ta-ta, pie man.
Thank you, Greta.
It's satisfying to change someone's life.
Look who's wandered into my booth.
My brother, Frasier.
Hello.
I've come to take the reins of my show, so scoot out of there.
This is a good time for a commercial.
This is Dr Niles Crane.
Let's get better.
You OK?
Your eyes look a little glassy.
I'm fine.
The drugs I took have some minor slide effects.
Frasier, look at me.
Do you see trails when I do this?
Whoa!
Wasn't doing that before!
You're not going on the air like this.
Stop it!
St St You're going to go to bed, rest and get rid of this fever so you can be as good as new.
Let's get better.
All right?
- All right?
- All right.
OK.
Maybe you can help me find someone to drive me home.
That's the most sensible thing you've said so far.
Frasier!
Frasier!
Hello, Seattle, I'm back.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I promise I will never leave you again.
So, let's take our first caller.
Hello, I'm listening.
'Hi, Dr Crane.
'Thanks for taking my call.
'I'm a bit nervous, OK?
My name is Robert.
' And your name is?
'My name is Robert.
' I'm sorry, we've already had a Robert today.
Goodbye.
It's Roz.
Could you get Security up here?
Captain Kirk's got control of the bridge, and he's gone insane.
- Who is this?
-  'I'm Janice.
' What's your problem?
'I'm having a problem breaking through a barrier with my in-laws.
' Boring!
Hello, you're on the crane with Frasier Air.
'Hi, Dr Crane, this is Marjorie.
'I'm having a problem with my boss.
'He doesn't respect me, and I don't have the courage to confront him.
' OK, Marjorie.
Well, let's see.
Let's do a little role-playing.
I'll be your boss, you be yourself.
Come in and talk to me in a forceful way, and tell me what you think.
- You may be surprised.
- 'Well, OK.
'Listen, Mr Ross, I've worked here 'for six years and I've never missed a day, 'but you've constantly promoted people less qualified than I am.
That's not fair.
' Oh, well, Marjorie, I must say I admire your forthrightness.
I wish the others spoke to me with an open mind.
You'll get that promotion.
- 'Hey, that was great!
' - Wasn't it?
OK, it's my turn.
I'm Marjorie, you're the boss now.
Come on!
These nice men will take you home.
I'm I'm doing my show.
I can't.
- I'm on the air.
- No.
You're on commercial.
Don't you worry your mucus-filled head.
Everything's under control.
- This is my show!
- Hey, this is fun.
Make it go faster!
Whee!
- Five seconds, Niles!
- All right.
This is Dr Niles Crane.
We haven't taken leave of our senses.
That bit of inspired lunacy was just a little docudrama Frasier and I put together on the dangers of overmedication.
Bravo, Frasier, for so brilliantly demonstrating why they call it "dope".
Daphne!
Daphne!
What?
I had another dream.
I dreamt I went to the station all doped up and made a big fool of myself!
They dragged me out of there like some lunatic.
Now, now.
That was just a dream.
You go back to sleep.
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- OK.
Ah Oh, Daphne Could I have a little lemonade?
With lemons and a sprig of mint.
Anything you want.
- Why'd you tell him it was a dream?
- No fun telling him the truth now.
I'll wait till tomorrow morning when he's good and lucid.
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Yeah, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Scrambled eggs all over my face What is a boy to do?
# Frasier has left the building.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Calm down, dear.
Listen.
Take a left, then the second right, then a left again.
- OK.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Is Maris lost again?
She wandered into the kitchen by mistake.
I had to talk her back to the living room.
Any chance of getting a table?
No.
They got their check five minutes ago, but they've been sitting there ever since.
- I shoot them dirty looks, all in vain.
- Show me the look.
They're there for a while.
- Shall we order?
- Why not?
- What are your coffees today?
- Zimbabwe and Kenya.
- Ooh, I'll have a Zimbabwe latte.
- I'll have a Kenya cappuccino.
So what's new?
The gardener finally won the battle of the wills.
He got Maris to dig up her camellias so he could put in that Zen garden.
- How did it turn out?
- It's beautiful.
The perfect place for meditation.
Yesterday I found Maris sitting in the lotus position.
Good for her.
It's bringing out her spiritual side.
She was reading Danielle Steele and making a nail appointment on her phone.
Do you realise that it's a year since I moved from Boston?
Really?
A year?
It seems like yesterday Dad moved in with you.
People can have opposite impressions of the same event.
Look at them.
Sitting there like they own that table.
- Let's both give them the look.
- It's worth a try.
- It worked!
- Niles, I'll never doubt you again!
Try the look on that table.
I'm going to the men's room.
- Maddening!
- What?
The moisturiser dispenser in the gents.
The cream is too oily, so I re-washed.
And then the hand dryer breaks down.
How do you get through the day?
- Here you go, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
- Thank you.
- Did I say decaf?
- No.
Oh, I'm sorry.
If I drink the regular stuff, it'll keep me tossing and turning through my brother's conversation.
'No problem.
'  'Thank you.
' Nobody's leaving.
Let's take a table outside.
Why not?
I'm feeling al fresco.
Oh, how does Mrs Fresco feel about that?
Must be a riot on camping trips.
- Would you like a?
- No.
Now that chapter two of your life is in full swing, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- Are you happy?
- Did you hear the question?
- Yes, I'm thinking.
- It's a complex question.
- No, it's not.
- It is.
- Either you're happy or not.
- Are you?
- No, but we're not talking about me.
Let's not gloss over that.
You have just told me you're not happy.
Why?
I was watching PBS the other night - a documentary on the Great Depression.
Vintage Steinbeck.
Poor people escaping the Dust Bowl, their meagre possessions on rickety, old trucks heading to their "salvation".
You see this scruffy little boy being handed a new pair of shoes.
Frasier, if you could have seen the look on that boy's face.
It was a look of pure and utter happiness.
I have never experienced that kind of happiness in my life.
Not even when I bought these $400 Bruno Maglis.
- Do you like them?
- Very nice.
- What about the tassels?
- I'm not a tassel guy.
Neither am I. Nevertheless, there they are.
I have no reason to be unhappy.
I have my health.
I have a wonderful home, a beautiful wife.
- Did your eyebrow just move?
- No.
I have my practice.
But I've lost the ideals that led me to psychiatry in the first place.
Who am I talking to?
Psychiatry's answer to the drive-through window.
Sometimes I wonder if I'm not just in it for the money.
Oh, I wouldn't say that's true.
If it were Oh.
- What were you going to say?
- I'd rather not.
There's no need to.
I know what you've wanted to ask me for years: Did I marry Maris for the money?
I resent that!
I did not marry Maris for the money.
- It was just a delightful bonus.
- So you really do love her?
Of course I love her!
But it's a different kind of love.
You mean, it's not human?
No.
I mean, it doesn't burn with the passion of a Tristan and Isolde.
It's more comfortable, more familiar.
Maris and I are old friends.
We can spend an afternoon together, me at my jigsaw puzzle, she at her Autoharp, not a word spoken between us, and be perfectly content.
I'm told it was a lot like that near the end in the Hitler household.
Let's shift the subject back to where it belongs.
I asked you whether you were happy.
Just answer.
- Well -  Hey, guys.
- Hi, Roz.
- What are you doing here?
I always wanted to fly a jet, and today they're offering a special on jet-flying lessons.
I came here to get coffee.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'd have been mad if you didn't.
I'm also meeting someone here.
Oh, let me guess.
A man?
- Yes.
- Yes.
The new guy from the news department caught me checking him out.
- He was bent over the water fountain.
- Love at first sight.
He said, "Let's get some coffee and get acquainted".
I've got a strange feeling that this guy might be the one.
You say that about every guy you meet.
Let's just see if this one calls back.
Yeah, I guess.
You know, I don't think he's here yet.
- I'll go snag a table.
- Good luck.
- Bye, Roz.
- Yeah.
- I don't think she likes me.
- It isn't a question of liking or not liking.
- She despises you.
- Really?
I warrant such strong emotions?
I barely acknowledge her existence.
You may be on to something there, Sherlock.
She is comely in a back-alley sort of way.
She's very attractive.
- Did you ever think about you two?
- Roz and me?
Oh, no.
Oh, come on!
Never fantasised about stealing away to a motel with her?
I'm a man with normal urges, and she has a silk blouse that opens a bit when she leans over the cart rack, but Oh, mixing work with romance Is it ever worth it?
Don't ask me.
You're the one that looked down her blouse.
- Decaf Zimbabwe latte.
- Is that non-fat milk?
- No.
- I hate to be a bother.
It's just that I'm watching my fat intake.
Is that rain?
- No, God is crying.
- Can't I ask a simple question?
Do you ask any other kind?
Hey, how the hell did she get a table?
Oh, Frasier, Frasier!
There!
Oh!
- Frasier!
- Oh, Niles, Niles!
Oh, good block!
Sorry!
Good work there.
I just wanted it a little more than he did.
Oh, boy, it's really coming down.
What?
Something happened the other morning.
I asked Dad to pass me a bran muffin.
You know what he said?
- He said, "What's the magic word"?
- You're kidding!
He didn't find it amusing when I said "rest home".
Oh, oh, oh!
Look, look!
That must be Roz's coffee companion.
Wow, he's really handsome, isn't he?
"Wow"?
Did you say "wow"?
Good Lord, I did.
I don't think I've ever said "wow" describing another man before.
Does that mean something?
It means you're a gay man.
Your life with Maris is a charade.
Come out of the closet.
You want to tell Dad or shall I?
This was stupid!
This whole idea was stupid!
Admit it.
No!
You needed exercise.
It was stupid to come out without your bumbershoot.
It's an umbrella!
Speak English!
Sorry, no dogs allowed.
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
It's OK.
- Oh, Niles?
- Hello, Dad.
- What are you two doing here?
- I felt we needed some exercise.
I had to pick up some beans anyway, so we walked.
Well, one of us was dragged by his collar.
I told you I didn't want to come.
Look at me, I'll die of pneumonia.
You'll outlive us.
The cranky ones always do.
Let's get you something hot to drink.
You want a cappuccino or?
- Can I help you?
- Coffee, black, nothing fancy in it.
We have two special coffees today I'll surprise you.
Oh, joy.
There's nothing like the smell of a wet dog to work up the appetite for supper.
- We're soaked to the skin!
- You're in a fine mood today!
- You left a mess in the kitchen.
- I had toast!
Yeah, and you buttered it on the counter.
I know because you left crumbs and toast sweat there!
- Toast sweat?
- Yes, yes.
When you put hot toast on any surface, it leaves drops of dew.
Haven't you heard Dad's lecture on the evils of toast sweat?
It's the scourge of our times!
One coffee, black.
And a decaf, non-fat Zimbabwe latte.
Oh, dear, is that cinnamon on that foam?
As long as we're picking each other's scabs here, I found Eddie's chew toy in my sweater cubby.
Hair all over my favourite pullover!
He sleeps in there!
Because you keep sweaters in a "cubby".
Oh!
Well, my bedroom is off-limits to this flea bag.
- He's not a flea bag!
- How about those Mariners?
Shut up, Niles!
If my hip's good enough to get me here, maybe it's time I found a place of my own!
- Where will you go?
- Don't worry.
I'll find a place.
I've got a little money saved up.
I never wanted to move in with you.
"I don't want to be a burden to anybody"!
That's Frasier's smartass way of telling me he's heard this.
You won't have to hear it again.
Tell Daphne to catch up with us.
We go through this melodrama every week!
Sit down!
- No.
How much for the coffee?
- $1.50.
For coffee?
What kind of world are we living in?
You were in that bathroom forever.
I tried that damn hand cream.
I'm so oily, I couldn't grip the doorknob.
When some guy came in, I said, "Am I glad to see you"!
I can't even begin to describe the look he gave me.
There it is.
So, I'm told you and your dad are at it again.
What's new?
Lately, he's had a face as long as a wet weekend.
Yesterday, when I insisted he do his stretching exercises, he told me to stick me feet behind me head and spin like a top.
The best thing to do is to ignore him when he's like that.
Isn't that right, Niles?
Niles?
I'm sorry.
For some reason, I'm feeling a little dizzy.
- I'll go after him.
- Oh, here.
- Take my bumbershoot.
- That's nice.
At least someone appreciates my mother tongue.
I've always had an ear for your tongue.
Oh, Niles!
What did I say?
- Want another coffee?
- Not until I've had my first one, thanks.
Why is it always so difficult between me and Dad?
Look at it from Dad's point of view.
As a policeman, he had authority.
That's been taken away.
Criticising the world, he controls his shrinking sphere of influence.
I do empathise with him.
It's just I can't help wishing to kick that cane out from under him sometimes and that he would land on Eddie.
- It's hard.
I know you're trying.
- I am.
Sometimes, I see the fruits of my labour.
The other night, Dad was watching TV.
I'd fallen asleep on the couch.
Suddenly I stirred.
I felt something on my head.
Dad was standing there, stroking my hair.
Dad?
Did he say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Don't you think it's time for a haircut?
You look like Bozo".
I know he was covering.
What do you think?
- Wouldn't hurt to get a trim.
- No - Do you think he was covering?
- Of course.
You know Dad.
Tough as nails on the outside, but on the inside, one giant spike.
- Grazie.
- Excuse me.
What about mine?
We have a team of specialists working on it.
Let's change the subject from Dad and talk about something else.
- Yes, about something light and frothy.
- I agree.
Are you in love with Daphne?
That's a little frothier than I had in mind.
That is preposterous!
I refuse to dignify that question with an answer.
I don't know.
There, I said it!
Are you happy?
Why did you have to hire Venus herself?
Why not a beefy, Eastern-European scrubwoman who reeked of ammonia?
I asked, but it was an Olympic year.
The agency was fresh out.
Frasier, I can't get her out of my mind.
Daphne stirs a passion in me I've never known before.
- You're not considering leaving Maris?
- No.
I suppose the situation you're in is that you'd like to stay with Maris but have an affair with Daphne.
- Yes.
Can I do that?
- No, you can't.
I thought that I couldn't, but you got my hopes up there for a minute.
Oh, it's easy for you.
You're free, you're happy.
You haven't answered that question yet.
- I haven't?
- No, you haven't.
Are you happy?
Well, I guess the best way I could think of saying it is - This sucks.
- What's the matter?
You're having coffee with a man and think he might lead you to something like, oh, I don't know, a life?
Suddenly, the trapdoor opens and you're right back in Roz's world.
- How did it go so wrong so quickly?
- Simple.
He just wanted to convert me.
I have nothing against religious people.
I'm ecumenical.
I embrace men of all faiths.
If only it stopped there.
He pretended it was a date.
Isn't there a commandment against that?
No, they didn't go into dating until the New Testament.
Roz, I'm sorry.
Why don't you join us?
No, thank you.
There's a cute new handyman in my building.
I'll just go home, slip into a negligee and rip out my faucet.
You think she's kidding, don't you?
I think about Roz's life, and it makes me wonder about my own.
I haven't been exactly burning up the social scene lately.
- You'll find somebody.
- But what if I don't?
What if I end up old and alone?
I might have to buy a funny little dog and move in with Frederick.
I don't have to worry about that for a while.
No.
Frederick should worry about that.
You might try answering my original question: Are you happy?
I guess I'd have to say - Hello, boys.
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
- Dad, what are you doing back here?
- I don't know, I I've been acting like a jerk lately, and taking it out on you and Daphne.
All that stuff I said earlier, forget about it.
- I already have.
- Come on, Eddie.
Dad, listen, has something been bothering you the last few days?
- No, no.
- Come on.
- Nothing.
- Is something bothering you?
- Just tell us.
- Just say it.
OK.
Last Sunday was my birthday.
Of course it was.
Frasier and I planned a big surprise party, but on your birthday it wouldn't have been a surprise.
Thus we waited a week.
So, surprise!
Oh, if you could see the look on your face.
Just give it up, Niles.
Dad, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.
- Come and have a seat.
You know, I don't know why I let it bother me.
All those years on the force, I missed enough of your birthdays.
You know what?
We can still celebrate.
We'll take you out to dinner tonight.
- You don't need to do that.
- Absolutely.
You name the place.
OK.
- How about Hoppy's Old Heidelberg?
- Oh, great!
Great!
They were voted best bratwurst in town.
Ach du lieber!
I've been on Third Street looking for you.
I was on Fourth Street.
Eddie had smelled everything on Third.
- How did you know I was here?
- One of me psychic flashes.
Bang!
There you were walking into Café Nervosa.
You were apologising for the way you've treated me this week.
I'm sorry about that.
Just forget about it, all right?
And something about a raise - You're winging it now.
- Am I that transparent?
No, I'm psychic.
The boys are taking us out to Hoppy's Old Heidelberg for dinner.
Oh, great.
German food!
We whip the Jerries twice this century, and they still have the last laugh.
Dad, sorry, I can't give you a ride.
- I'll give him a lift.
- Ah.
I've enjoyed getting together with you for coffee.
- What do you talk about all the time?
- Sports, chicks, monster truck rallies.
OK, don't tell me.
Zimbabwe, decaf, non-fat milk, no cinnamon in sight.
Now Are you happy?
You know, in the greater scheme of things, yes, I'd say I am.
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # See you next year!
We love you!
