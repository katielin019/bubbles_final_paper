{START OF EPISODE 1}
Well, I should warn you, ifwe hitturbulence, I may hold onto you for dear life.
Well, I should warn you, I'm hoping for a bumpy ride.
So, why are you going to Acapulco?
Actually, it's rather an amusing story.
I came down to the airport on sort of a blind date with a cello player.
She didn't know it was a blind date.
Actually, it was all in my head.
So when I bumped into you and you said you were going to Acapulco, I thought, why not tag along?
So the only reason you're on this plane is because of me?
Call it kismet.
- Can I switch seats?
- Sure.
You're lucky.
Normally this flight is jammed.
See, kismet.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I have to say, I'd be flattered if someone got on a plane to be with me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What could be more romantic than that?
It's awkward trying to talk like this.
Is that seat taken?
No.
Come sit here, please.
Pardon me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
At last.
Well, I'm Frasier Crane.
- Felicity Stafford.
- It's a pleasure.
And this is my husband, David.
A genuine pleasure.
Oh, darn.
I forgot to order my kosher meal.
Excuse me.
So sorry.
Pardon me.
I'm so sorry.
Well, it was lovely meeting you both.
Stewardess Oh, thank you.
Bless you.
Oh, thank God the flight's late.
I was sure I'd missed it.
Thank you.
Yes, it's me.
It's amazing what they can do with make-up and lighting.
Yes, it is amazing.
Not that they didn't have plenty to workwith.
By "plenty" I don't mean anything, you know, referring to, well, you know.
You stay there.
I'll change seats.
No, wait.
Your voice sounds really familiar.
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio.
- Kelly Easterbrook, from the magazine.
- Yes.
Well, I'm assuming that you're off to a photo shoot on the beaches of Mexico.
No, I only model part-time these days.
I'm in a PhD programme at the University ofWashington.
- What's your field?
- Zoology.
That's why I'm going to Mexico, to observe the spiny-tailed iguana.
A model and a scholar.
This is the part where I normally wake up.
I know what you're thinking.
Last night, walking along the beach, when we kicked off our shoes and looked up at that amazing blanket of stars I was remembering when that iguana ran across your foot, and you jumped into my arms.
Oh, yes, that, too.
You're really quite strong.
I am a supermodel.
So, Frasier Is there any chance you'd be interested in seeing more of me?
There's more?
Of course.
Of course.
I was hoping we would.
Oh, that's great.
There is one thing I should mention.
It's a little awkward.
What is it?
Well, I'm in the process of breaking up with someone.
He plays for the Seahawks, and with all of us in the public eye, these things have a way of getting out.
So I'd appreciate it if, just for now, you didn't tell anyone about you and me.
What happened between us will never leave this room.
Ifthere's a God in heaven, neither will we.
Have you seen Frasier?
- He's not back from the airport yet?
- No.
That's a lot of cheese and crackers.
You gonna eat all those?
Don't be stupid.
I'm havin' people over tonight.
- Morning, all.
- There you are.
I almost gave up on you.
So, Mr lmpulsive, I got your message.
- How was Mexico?
- Fine.
Relaxing.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?
Considering what a slump your sex life has been in, I know you were hoping for a little, you know, action.
You know, south ofthe border.
Just because you went to Mexico and were hit on more than a pinata, doesn't mean that was the purpose of my visit as well.
Yeah, right.
You wanted to hear the Acapulco Philharmonic.
So, Doc, you get any?
- That is none ofyour business!
.
- Well, better luck next time.
Did it occur to you that I met a woman?
I just don't care to broadcast it.
Sure, that might happen.
Frankly, I don't have time for this nonsense.
What I did or did not do is not your concern.
Do you have nothing to do but enquire about my sex life?
Frasier Crane's sex life.
There's a word for that.
It's an oxy, oxy - Moron.
- Hey, easy.
I'll get it.
All right now, flip over.
Ten kicks on each side.
Geez, I hate this one.
What does it do anyway?
Nothing for you.
But it does get a nice breeze going.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Daphne.
Hello, Eddie.
Good boy, Dad.
- That's it.
I'm through.
- Where's Frasier?
He got in a while ago, but jumped in the shower.
- We don't know why he went to Mexico?
- You heard the message we did.
He wanted to be spontaneous so he jumped on a plane.
That doesn't concern you?
It's not like him to board a plane without reservations and luggage, slumber mask.
He probably went down there to try to meet some women.
I've seen this with my patients.
They get so distressed over their failures, especially romantic ones, that they act out in bizarre ways.
Is there anything more refreshing after a long flight than a hot soak in eucalyptus salts and a snifter ofwarmed Poire William?
Nothing yet, but keep your ears open.
Dr Crane, we're all eager to hear about your trip.
- Nice time?
- Yes, lovely.
Yeah, did you meet any girls?
You know me, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
Struck out, huh?
Well, it'll all turn around for ya.
You assume it's impossible for me to meet a woman.
No need to get mad.
I just feel bad for you.
We all do.
You know, frankly, I'm sick and tired of everyone's pity.
The fact is I did meet a woman down there.
A fabulous woman, and we had a romantic weekend.
- Why didn't you just tell us that?
- I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Oh, yes, that pesky Club Med oath of silence.
No!
.
She asked me to be discreet.
See, she's a rather famous supermodel and she's going through a break-up with a star football player on the Seahawks, and she didn't want any publicity.
So, you see, before I identify her to you, I have to ask that you not ever repeat this to anyone.
I'd urge you to do the same.
Her name is Kelly Easterbrook.
The lotion girl!
She has such milky skin.
I thought so, yes.
We were inseparable the entire weekend.
Some people think I look like her.
Oh, yes Anyway, I've got a picture of her.
I'll be right back.
It's one thing to concoct a little white lie, but a supermodel Who'd dump an NFL player for Frasier.
You two are just being awful.
I've never known Dr Crane to lie.
Actually, this is not without precedent.
He once forged letters from Leonard Bernstein and said they were pen pals.
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember?
He'd come bounding up the stairs.
"Got another one from Lenny".
We were all agog until he wrote that his Broadway debut was Candide when everyone knows that it was On the Town.
That's when we knew it was a fake.
The sloppy kid lettering was also a clue.
Here she is.
- It's from a magazine?
- She's in lots of magazines.
And billboards, too.
Now she's my girlfriend.
Well, I'm off to bed.
Didn't get much sleep over the weekend.
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah.
Good night.
He just snapped like a twig, didn't he?
Hello?
Kelly!
Hi.
Gee, I didn't know you were back in town.
I'd love to.
Right.
Well, I'll see you there in, what, half an hour.
OK, yeah, me, too.
Bye.
Frasier, glad we caught you.
Coming to the Buster Keaton retrospective?
I'm dashing offto LeScali for a late lunch with Kelly.
Oh, your supermodel.
- You didn't mention that this morning.
- She just called.
She came home early from Hawaii.
I suspect to see you-know-who.
Bernard?
Yes, Dr Crane.
I need my usual table in about twenty minutes.
And chill your finest bottle of Pouilly-Fuiss√©.
Well, modelling those swimsuits, she works up quite a thirst.
Oh, poor sod.
Doesn't he know how outlandish it sounds?
Even a fake supermodel would have dumped him by now.
I wish there was something we could do.
There is.
When he was in the throes of his Bernstein obsession, we confronted him.
As you may recall, Dad, he was relieved that he could give up the charade.
Well, I guess we could talk to him.
But what're we going to say?
It won't be easy.
We'll tell him we know what's going on and he doesn't have to pretend anymore.
All right, but situations like that make me uncomfortable.
There's always the chance that we'll walk into that restaurant and some gorgeous supermodel will be draped all over Frasier.
That's a good one, Dad.
We needed that.
I thought we could do with a little tension-breaker.
Frasier?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.
Here, sit.
I ordered us an appetiser.
Oh, this is so sweet, but I can't stay.
- My lab called.
Small emergency.
- Is everything all right?
Our incubator broke, and my iguana eggs need to be moved to another lab.
- I hope you understand.
- Of course.
We'll do it again sometime.
- I'll call you as soon as I'm done.
- Great.
OK.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Here's hoping your eggs are still fertile.
My wife had trouble conceiving, too.
It turned out to be me.
Well, mystery solved.
Offyou go.
Oh, that is so sad.
I'll say.
Nobody's ever bought me caviar, and I'm real.
Maybe this is a family thing.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hey!
Dad, Niles.
Is something the matter?
No, we thought we'd stop by and see if you'd changed your mind about the movie.
You seem to be awfully persistent, but I just may join you.
My date cancelled at the last moment.
Frasier.
Whatever makes you feel the need to perpetuate this fantasy woman, you don't have to on our account.
- Fantasy?
- We're your family.
We don't care if you haven't been out with anybody in quite a while.
My God!
You actually believe that I've invented this relationship.
It's no crime to go down to Acapulco and come back empty-handed.
I did not come back empty-handed.
I came back with two huge handfuls.
Kelly was just here.
She was called away on an emergency.
That would be a modelling emergency?
No.
She only models to raise money for her real interest/ zoology.
She's a PhD candidate and she raises iguanas.
The incubator broke, and her eggs were in danger.
It was vital that only she The details are unimportant.
The fact is, I am having a relationship with this woman.
We love you, Frasier.
Niles, me, Daphne Leonard Bernstein.
I knew one day you'd throw that back in my face!
- Kelly!
- Hi!
I was leaving you a note.
I'm sorry about lunch.
It's all right.
Want to come in?
Sure.
Good news is I was able to move all of my eggs over to another lab.
Well, I hope you didn't put them all in one basket.
Why does everyone think that's funny?
What a beautiful apartment.
Thank you.
Can I interest you in a glass of Beaujolais Nouveau?
- I'd love some.
- All right.
I actually have something to toast.
My doctorate advisor has asked me to join his researchers going to the Gal√°pagos lslands.
Well, that does deserve a toast.
I'm replacing someone, so it's last minute.
We leave in the morning.
I'll be there for two months inseminating indigenous iguanas.
I called all my friends.
They couldn't believe it.
Nor will mine.
Two months, huh?
Hey, I feel terrible leaving town so early in our relationship, but it's an opportunity of a lifetime.
I'll be here when you return, and we'll have one incredible night to look back on fondly.
I'll thinkwe'll be looking back on two incredible nights.
No, it's just one night/ Saturday night.
Then, of course, Sunday you were Oh, right.
- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing.
I must have drifted off there.
What's that noise?
I don't hear anything.
You took a picture of me while I was asleep?
- Absolutely not!
- Then what is this?
This is it's your going-away present.
Bon voyage.
- You're disgusting.
- Listen, you don't - I don't believe this!
- Listen - Get out!
Get out!
- Wait.
- All right.
- Get out!
You'd think being a model, you might be more relaxed about somebody taking a Get out!
Can't we talk about this?
I won't see you again for two months.
You won't see me again for a lot longer than that!
It wasn't enough just to say you bagged a model?
You had to take a picture?
- Were you planning to sell it?
- No!
Pass it around the office?
Show it to your friends?
No, just my immediate family.
- I'm taking the stairs.
- Kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly Well, you missed her again.
She's running down the stairs.
You can catch her if you want to.
We believe you, Frasier.
Now let's just get your robe all cinched up and get you back inside.
Don't patronise me!
Oh, look, look!
Two wine glasses!
Oh, yes, one for you, one for her.
That proves it all right.
I am not crazy!
I am dating a supermodel zoologist, who I stole away from a professional football player, and she is off to the Gal√°pagos lslands to artificially inseminate iguanas.
Is that so hard to believe?
Frasier, I want Oh, look, a crowd.
Where were you hiding?
Under the bed?
It makes me sick to think I'd even spend one nightwith you, let alone two!
I've known a lot of reptiles and looked under a lot of rocks in my life, but I have never seen anything slither out quite as slimy and repulsive as you!
Well, what do you think of me now?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
-Good morning, Roz.
- Good morning.
Whatwas that?
- Shoot!
He's not even here.
- Who?
Remember that guy who dumped me last month?
I thought he was behind me.
I wanted him to see me with a guy so he'd know I'm over him.
Good idea.
Ifthat doesn't work we can marry and have children.
That'll fix his wagon.
I know you remember him Stan?
Stan The smug stockbroker that kept calling me "Fraser"?
- Oh, God - That's him.
We're hot and heavy, then he stops calling.
It's humiliating to be treated like you don't exist.
How can he not hearthe difference between Frasier and Fraser?
That's what bugged me the most, too.
Double espresso to go, please.
I almost forgot.
Here's an invitation to my dad's birthday party.
Sherry's giving it, so please excuse the elegant verse, but "Come one, come all, to jump and jive, Marty Crane's turning 'sexty-five".
' - Oh, my God, here he is.
Please - Oh, all right.
- Hello.
- Hello, Niles.
This isn't what it looks like.
Her ex-boyfriend was Stop that!
Please, no explanation necessary.
At the next meeting of the "Haven't Kissed Roz" Club, it'll just be me and the Archbishop.
I'll save you the club dues.
Everyone kisses better than Maris!
One of the same for Dr Crane, please.
Thanks.
Sorry I'm late.
I was shopping for Dad's present.
I did a bit ofthat myselfthis morning.
Found a lovely little calfskin wallet with a matching key case.
Well, bravo, Frasier.
Itwas a full $20 below our agreed-upon spending limit.
- I'm glad we agreed to rein ourselves.
- God, me too.
Do away with our annual contest to see who could get Dad the most lavish gift.
The competition had gotten What is the best word for it?
- Extreme.
- No, childish.
- Gaudy.
- Crass.
- Obscene.
- Baroque.
Stop it!
So, what did you get him?
Oh, just some beer.
We're not bumping our heads on that spending ceiling.
It's a bit fancier.
It's a membership in a beer club.
They deliver a case from a micro-brewery monthly.
You know, I looked into those clubs.
They were rather expensive.
Not really.
I'm at our limit.
Maybe with taxes, I'm a drop or two over.
- How big a drop?
- Just $100 over.
- That's a downpour!
- It's a dribble.
That's a deluge, and stop it!
Why not stick $100 in that wallet ofyours and we're even?
Frankly, I don't need to buy Dad's love.
You saw fit to violate our agreement, so be it.
- I have a gift.
You have a gift.
- Fine.
Big baby.
Stare all you like.
You'll not distract me from my paper.
You see?
Your efforts are futile.
I can't even see you.
It's so unhealthy.
Isn't she serving anything at Dad's party but meat?
Sherry says that's what he and his old cronies like.
With drinks, she's serving cocktail franks.
For appetisers, we're having a sausage medley, and for the main course, there's a choice of meatloaf or meatballs.
I assume these balloons are for the between-course angioplasty.
- Did you get everything, darlin'?
- I think so.
Good news!
I found a guy who can sculpt an exact replica of Marty's old police badge out of six pounds of liverwurst.
Reminiscent ofthe cream cheese gavel they gave Thurgood Marshall on his 80th.
We can't use this photograph.
It's too embarrassing.
That's why we're using it.
I'm decorating the party with pictures of Marty from the force.
We can't use this one of me at the morgue.
It's too disturbing.
You're right.
I'd forgotten you even had a perm.
Dear Lord.
I can't wait to see this guy again.
Mickey Dugan.
- We rode Mounted Patrol together.
- Look at you!
You look so big and handsome on your horse!
- Oh, my God!
When was this taken?
- April Fool's Day.
That explains why your horses are wearing brassieres.
God, I loved that horse.
Old Agides and I were together for eight years.
- Best partner I ever had.
- We should get going.
Wherever did you find a bra that could fit a horse?
Mickey brought it in from home.
Mae Dugan was a lot ofthings, but petite she wasn't.
I'll point her out at the party.
Honey, ifthat's her bra, I can spot her myself.
- Sherry, Niles?
- No, thanks.
I've got a session.
- Dr Crane, is your father gone?
- Yes, he has.
Good, I'll wrap his present.
They fit fine in this box.
- Great.
Off you go.
- Wait a minute.
- That box is big for what you got him.
- No, it isn't.
Your binoculars fit just perfectly in here.
You told me you got him a wallet and a key case.
Oh, no, not this again.
It's the same nonsense every year.
We'd agreed to a spending limit until someone else exceeded it.
All right, guilty as charged.
We've each violated the pact once.
Let's stop before this gets out of hand.
Ifyou ask me, your gifts complement one another perfectly.
Your binoculars and your football tickets.
- Tickets?
- Season tickets to the Seahawks.
I don't believe you!
You already had a better gift than mine.
You still needed to take it to a higher level!
I knew you'd upgrade that wallet, which you did.
Enough is enough.
I'm throwing in the towel.
Why should I believe you?
This is a receipt forthe binoculars.
This should prove that I have no intention of returning them in orderto get a better gift.
Well, that's very big ofyou.
I'm late for my session.
If it's any consolation, I'm not sure how good those tickets are.
I'd hoped for the first few yard lines, but could only get ones way back on the fiftieth.
I'm very proud ofyou, Dr Crane Stop babbling.
Bring me some tape.
OK, the keg of beer will be there by six.
I also confirmed the band, ordered the cake, filled out the place cards, picked up the humorous cocktail napkins, and I'm almost done making the centrepieces.
This party is just gonna wear me out.
- Hello, Daphne, Sherry.
- Niles!
Double latte, please.
Thank you.
Is Frasier with you?
- No, he's out shopping for your dad.
- That jackal!
- What was that all about?
- Brother snit.
Don't ask.
I forgot to tell you, I found this fabulous photograph of Marty arresting some guy.
I had it blown up to life-size, then cut out the face so people could look through and have a snapshot of Marty reading them their rights.
Don't you just love it?
- It depends.
Do I have to pick it up?
- By five.
You're a doll.
- Hello, mesdemoiselles.
- Oh, Frasier!
- Did you find something?
- Yes, I did.
It took most of the afternoon, but I found something I think is perfect.
Niles forgot his coffee.
- Niles was here?
- Yes.
When I mentioned you were shopping, he shot out of here.
That little worm!
- Dr Crane, are you all right?
- No, I am not.
I've combed the entire city trying to find a gift.
Nothing is better than what Niles got him.
- What did your brother get him?
- I don't know.
I'm sure it's something any father would just love.
The best thing about turning 65 is, everybodywants to buy you dinner.
Mr Crane, your top button is unbuttoned.
Duke's taking me to Hoppe's Old Heidelberg.
You know, if I don't unbutton it now, it might fly off and hurt somebody.
- Enjoy, Dad.
- Yeah, I will.
I gotta tell ya, I'm lovin' this birthday.
Suddenly, my money's no good.
Last night Ed Flanagan bought the bar a round in my honour.
- Who's Ed Flanagan?
- That's what I asked.
- What're you doing tonight, Fras?
- Nothing much.
- Got some shopping to do.
- For anybody we know?
You know, Frasier, every year you and Niles, you go overboard trying to find these great presents for me, and, you know, I gotta be honest, it's always made me uncomfortable.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So this year, I just wanted you to know, I'm over it.
So go crazy!
You only turn 65 once!
You know, Dr Crane, the last thing I want to do is encourage more competition between you and Niles.
But ifyou really want to make your father happy, maybe - No, don't even say it!
- It's all he's ever asked for!
No, God, it'll ruin my apartment!
My life!
I can't!
I won't!
I mustn't!
It's over, Dr Crane.
That is one big-screen TV!
- He's gonna love it.
- I know.
Perhaps I'm panicking needlessly.
It just needs dressing up.
Here, I'll just arrange these plants here at the base.
You always said you needed more greenery in here.
And maybe an objet or two on top.
Yes, this, this little bud vase.
Here.
That makes a difference, doesn't it?
Sure it does, Dr Crane.
All the difference in the world.
It's ghastly.
You don't just put a smear of lipstick on the Bride of Frankenstein and turn her into a trophy wife, do you?
- Niles!
- Are you ready?
We told Dad we'd pick him up at - Oh, my God, you didn't!
- Didn't what?
Buy Dad this television set?
Of course I did!
It's impressive, isn't it?
I knew how jealous you were, but to go to such insane lengths to top me, you have lain waste to your apartment with this eyesore.
I disagree.
You see an eyesore, I see a window into a world of art and culture.
Think how this screen will enhance the majesty ofthe Metropolitan Opera.
Orthe thrilling artists ofthe Bolshoi.
You're quite a "Bolshoi" artistyourself.
You're right.
It's dreadful, isn't it?
But it's worth it to imagine the smile it'll put on Dad's face, not the mention the pleasure ofwatching you writhe in envy.
- You're not writhing.
- I'm sorry, my mind wandered.
I was remembering Dad waxing nostalgic about his beloved old horse Agides.
Don't try to change the subject.
You've lost.
He did love that horse.
You can only live in denial for so long before you You didn't?
Didn't what?
Buy the horse?
Sorry.
Did.
How could you?
I've set him up in a stable.
Dad can visit him any time he wants.
I'd like to swing bythe stable on the way to the party so Dad can look his gift horse in the mouth.
All right, Niles.
What else can I do?
I give up.
You win.
You have found the one gift that can't be trumped.
Thank you, Frasier.
You're a gracious loser.
Still, on the bright side, I know Dad will love this set.
He really will.
It doesn't seem quite as intrusive as it did when it got here.
Right this way.
- What are those?
- Your speakers.
Dad, any idea where you are?
It's so mysterious.
Hay underfoot.
Stable smells.
That saddle we just tripped over.
- I mean, we could be anywhere.
- All right, all right.
Hold on.
Voil√†!
Happy birthday.
Agides!
Hey, buddy!
How ya doin'?
Oh, long time no see.
- What's goin' on?
- He's yours, Dad.
- What?
- I bought him for you.
You're kiddin' me.
I can't believe it.
- You can visit him any time you want.
- What?
This is amazing.
How've you been, buddy?
Hey, one plus one equals?
He remembers!
I figured it was a long shot.
They were about to put him out to pasture.
I set him up here, the most exclusive stable in town.
Don't be surprised ifyou spy a certain resident trotting by wearing his triple crown.
They don't give them actual crowns, you twit!
Come on, we don't want to be late for the party.
I'm sure Sherry's gettin' warm in that cake.
Dad?
Don't want to be late.
- You all right, Dad?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.
I'm fine.
Come on, let's go to my party.
Is there something you'd like to talk about?
You don't have to pull everything apart.
I said I'm fine, all right?
Let's go.
All that effort, all that expense How many minutes of joy did it buy?
Oh, dear God, it's Stonehenge.
I hope it'll cheer Dad up.
The party certainly didn't.
God, I know.
Not even when Sherry sang that little ditty she composed.
"You can cop a feel if I can feel a cop".
- Brandy, Niles?
- Please.
I tried to draw Dad out at the party.
He shot me down.
You know how he is.
He gets himself into these moods.
He just retreats.
It's just so damned frustrating.
I wonder if that's why we go so insane trying to find the perfect gift, as if finding the right present will change everything.
- That occurred to me, too.
- You didn't mention it.
- It occurred to me.
- So you say.
Stop it!
Hiya, boys!
She's a beaut!
Marty and I are going to be spending a lot more time over here.
It's a gift that keeps on giving.
- So where's your dad?
- He said he was coming with you.
He told me he was coming home with you.
Why would he do that?
He was a little down at the party.
Maybe he just wanted to go for a walk.
I'm sure he's all right.
He'll be back soon.
Still, it is rather late.
I think I'll just go and look for him.
I thinkyou're fretting needlessly.
Let's fire this baby up.
You like the Nashville Network?
Who am I kidding?
I'm worried sick!
Here ya go.
Hey, no offence, butyourteeth look like hell.
I gotta tell ya, the rest ofyou is not lookin' much better either.
Here, let me give ya a little rubdown, huh?
That takes me back.
Of course, your coat was a lot shinier in those days.
Hell, so was mine.
We were somethin', weren't we, Agides?
Riding crowd control.
People just step aside to let us pass.
Now they're puttin' you out to pasture, and I'm ridin' the buses.
Yeah, it's fun gettin' old, isn't it?
Hey, but this is a nice place here, you know.
I bet you're really gonna like it here.
Ifyou don't like it here, then we'll do what we said we would.
We'll just go to Montana, start a ranch.
We've still got that money from those drug dealers buried in the box canyon.
All right, Dad, we know you know we're here.
Then why don't you get the hell outta here?
I just want to be alone for a minute.
Is that all right?
- Fine.
We'll see you later.
- Thank you.
It's troubling that you feel more comfortable talking to your horse than to your sons.
We might be able to help you.
The ageing process No, now stop it.
You see, this is the problem.
I know everything you're gonna say.
You start talkin' about 65 as being some sort of passage.
Then you'll start spoutin' theories and who knows what else.
By the time you get through analysing me, I'm gonna be 66.
Look, when I tell Agides somethin', you know what he does?
Nothin'.
He just listens to me.
- We listen.
- That's my slogan.
"I'm listening".
- You know, Dad, for God's sake - They pay a great deal of money Hey!
Right.
Look, when I saw Agides today, it was kind of a shock to see how old he's gotten, and I just - I realised how old I've gotten.
- You still have a lot of years - No, please.
- Sorry.
It's not a problem you can solve, it's just a fact of life.
People get old.
I guess this horse wasn't the banner gift I thought it would be.
Oh, yes, it was, Niles.
I'm feelin' a bit sorry for myself now, but I'll get over that.
But I love this horse.
It's the greatest present I've ever got.
Well, I'm glad, Dad.
But, you know, I think I may have misled you.
The horse is from me and from Frasier.
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.
Thanks a lot, Fras.
Well, actually, it was mostly Niles' idea.
Well, then, thanks to both ofya.
It's just great.
Well, we oughta get goin', huh?
Let's get a move on.
Hey, see you, buddy!
Niles, what a generous gesture.
How can I ever thank you?
By calling your super and getting rid ofthat monstrosity in your apartment.
I do visit from time to time, you know.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Trickortreat.
Or should I say pip pip?
- What's with the outfit?
- This is part ofyour costume.
You said you were getting me a Sherlock Holmes outfit.
They were out of Sherlock Holmes.
Don't worry, it's another detective.
You'll be Lord Peter Wimsey.
Who's that?
He's a sleuth from a series of novels by Dorothy L Sayers.
I'm not going anywhere where I have to tell people my name's Wimsey.
I'm just going to wear my old police uniform.
It's a Halloween ball for the Library Association.
You have to go as a character from literature.
Why didn't I go with Sherry to visit her mother in prison?
It'll be fun.
I'm going as Cyrano de Bergerac.
Musician.
Philosopher.
Fighter.
The greatest friend and the bravest swordsman alive.
What's all over your cane?
I dropped it in the movie theatre last night.
I love this picture.
You look adorable in that.
I do not.
You like it because you look so handsome in it.
The camera doesn't lie.
What are you giggling about?
Snapshots from ourtrip to the microbrewery.
That must have been fun for you, Dad.
- You're not in any of these.
- I didn't go.
Eddie got into the poison oak.
I was up all night rubbing calamine lotion on his belly.
These really are the golden years foryou, aren't they?
So itwas justyou and Frasier?
We got pretty silly aftertasting all that beer.
There's no need to tell Niles everything we did.
Yes, we got a bit naughty.
Not too naughty, I hope.
Dr Crane, I know what you're thinking.
After all that drinking, we didn't drive home.
We spent the night in a motel.
That takes a load off my mind.
Niles, what time is this little soiree ofyours this evening?
I've still got to get the velvet in my slippers recrushed.
Dad, I will find you a Sherlock Holmes outfit.
before Marta arrives to set up.
She's arachnophobic.
Last Halloween she beat my centrepiece to bits with a broom.
Perhaps we should go finish up those costumes, wife.
- Did you say "wife"?
- Hasn't your brother told you?
He's going as Geoffrey Chaucer from The Canterbury Tales.
- I'll be dressed as the Wife of Bath.
- And a saucy strumpet she is, too.
You naughty rogue.
We've been having quite a time talking like that.
It's been ye olde laugh riot around here.
- Join me in my bed chamber, my lord?
- After you, my juicy wench.
"My juicy wench"?
No, not you, Maris.
Wait.
I hope you're happy.
She's run for her water pills.
Roz, who's on the line?
We have Ted who is feeling a little disconnected.
Go ahead, Ted.
I hope Ted appreciates irony.
On line two we have Bill.
He's going through a very difficult transition.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello?
Is someone there?
I see we're pretty much through our transition, aren't we, Bill?
- This is Dorothy.
- Bill's on line one.
Let's just stay with Dorothy.
- How can I help you?
- You can get me Roz.
I'm hermanicurist.
She called for an appointment.
I'll call you back later, Dorothy.
We'll take a moment to regroup.
I apologise for the unusually high number of technical difficulties we've experienced today.
And now we will go to these public service messages.
- Explain yourself.
- I'm a little off my game today.
- A little?
- OK, a lot.
You come in looking ghoulish, even for Halloween, and you sleepwalk through my show.
- I'm sorry.
- What kind of explanation can there be for this level of unprofessionalism?
I think I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
I took a home test and it was iffy, so I went to see my doctor.
He'll call me with results later.
- But, Roz, how?
- I don't know how.
No one is more careful than I am when it comes to birth control.
But even the best protection is only effective 99 out of 100 times.
I can't beat those odds.
I suppose you've been dodging that bullet for a long time now.
Promise you won't tell anyone.
Of course not, Roz, but we don't even know ifwe have anything to tell yet.
- What if there is?
- We'll deal with that when we have to.
No use crossing that bridge until we come to it.
I can't get my mind off it.
Niles' party will be a distraction.
- I don't think I'm up for that.
- Come on, Roz.
- Well, I did rent a costume.
- lt'll be fun.
You know you want to.
That's exactly the kind of talk that got me into this.
Tell your brother I'm coming to his party.
I found the perfect costume.
What literary character will you be?
Waldo.
From Where's Waldo?
He's in 16 books.
You call yourselfwell-read.
Niles Crane.
Maris, where are you?
You're still at the beauty parlour?
Calm down.
Stop crying.
It can't be as bad as all that.
Exactly how much hair do you have left?
We just have to find another character for you to be.
There's an lonesco play called The Bald Soprano.
No, I'm joking, Maris.
You've got to come.
Maris, you have 37 wigs.
Go down to the wig vault and pick one.
Maris, this evening means a great deal to me.
I need you here with me.
Do you care about my feelings at all?
That answers that.
How's the party?
We just got here.
We had a bit of a delay.
Sherlock led us to the wrong apartment.
I notice you didn't complain when the old lady gave us peanut-butter cups.
Evening, all.
What lovely costumes.
Daphne, you look particularly beautiful.
Thanks.
It's a bit tight.
I must have put on a pound or two.
That's enough out ofyou, you wanton troll, or I'll smite your bawdy backside with the flat of my sinewy hand.
At least on the ride over I could stick my head out the window.
- Where's the bar?
- Over here.
I'm serving grog and mead.
Which one tastes most like beer?
Roz, I'm so glad you came.
- Any word from the doctor?
- No.
I am going crazy.
I can't even picture myself as a mother.
Can you?
I don't think discipline will be a problem.
Roz, don't you look smashing.
What an interesting costume.
Who are you?
I'm O from The Story of O. It's going to be a long night.
I thinkyou look lovelytonight.
There's a real glow aboutyou.
Oh, no.
Not a glow.
I'm sorry, I'm just a little jumpy.
I had an accident, and I haven't found out what the damage is yet.
I need to check my machine.
Is there a phone?
At the top ofthe stairs.
Try not to worry.
A few years back I got rear-ended.
Is that what happened to you?
Not exactly.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Are you here alone?
- I hope so.
What a delectable medley of fromagian splendour.
You must try one.
Cheesy.
Yes, cheesy.
It must be glorious to have such a happy knack for clarity and concision.
Yep.
Who are you?
Chingachgook.
I'm the last ofthe Mohicans.
Well, that little mystery's solved.
- Have you seen Roz?
- She's probably on the phone.
Every 15 minutes she's calling her machine.
This little accident's got her pretty worried.
- She told you about it?
- Champagne?
Not now, Niles.
Please, excuse us.
We need a moment alone.
Roz told me all about it.
It's no big deal.
Accidents happen even when you're careful.
I had one a few years back.
Daphne, really?
It was one of those real wham-bam numbers.
He was drunk and I wasn't paying attention.
I called but never got a penny out of him.
- I had no idea.
- It's not so bad.
Back in Manchester with all those drunken louts out and about, it must have happened to me at least a dozen times.
Really?
I had no Really?
Nothing's certain until we get the pregnancy test results.
Pregnancy?
We're not talking about a car accident, are we?
- Oh, dear.
- Roz is pregnant?
- No.
Where could you get such a notion?
- You just said she was.
Shut up.
Or I'm smite you with the back of my sinewy right hand.
- Did you notice where Frasier went?
- No idea.
- What about Daphne?
- Haven't a clue.
Holmes, you astound me.
I just feel terrible about this.
Roz swore me to secrecy.
- I never should have said anything.
- She thought I knew.
Do you have a tissue?
These lashes are killing me.
I must be allergic to the adhesive.
Just promise me you won't tell a soul.
We've got to keep this secret.
All right.
But we can't keep it a secret forever.
We are talking about a baby.
How could I have been so careless?
- It's not your fault.
- You know who'll be blamed.
Don't worry.
I'll protect your reputation.
I'll tell everyone I forced you to do it.
Better get back to the party before people start wondering about us.
Hello, Niles.
What's your nose all bent out of shape about?
There's a literary figure I'd like to know better.
- I need a word with you.
- What about?
Stay there.
I have guests to greet.
Trick or treat.
- How did you get past the doorman?
- We live in the building.
- This isn't a good night for this.
- But it's Halloween.
Crab pufffor you, and some gravlax for you, and pat√© for Dracula.
Now offyou go.
I need to talk to you.
Not now, Niles.
Let me guess.
Lady Godiva?
No, Eve.
From the Bible.
Well, now I know why they call it the Good Book.
- Are you just going to abandon Daphne?
- Just because I gave her a ride doesn't mean I have to spend the evening with her.
Get a load of that schnozzola.
- No, wait.
Guess who I am?
- I give up.
I'm Waldo.
From Where's Waldo?
You know.
The guy you can't find because he blends into the crowd.
I don't know, but I'd love a demonstration.
And to think that all that time your cat was curled up in your sock drawer.
They're almost human, aren't they?
Pardon me, I need a word with my brother.
Not now.
I'm doing really well here.
This pointy hat is a babe magnet.
It's urgent.
Just keep your voice down.
I'm sorry.
Will you excuse me?
Hurry back.
Your behaviour is appalling.
I can no longer hold my tongue.
Replace tongue with liquor.
You're drunk.
Drunk like a fox.
- I know about the baby.
- You do?
Who told you?
- I heard it from Daphne.
- Daphne?
That blabbermouth.
I'll wring her neck.
- Have you no conscience?
- You're getting awfully exercised.
We're talking about a single woman with a baby.
- What do you intend to do about it?
- I suppose I could give her a raise.
That's your idea of responsibility?
What do you want me to do, marry her?
She's the one that got pregnant.
- Hello, Roz.
- Beat it, Niles.
Stay here.
I am so mad at you.
How could you tell Niles about the baby?
I didn't.
Daphne told him, that damnable chatterbox.
- And who told Daphne?
- That would be me.
What is itwith all you children?
Isn't it pastyour bedtime?
Dr Crane, it's me, Dr Krovitz.
Of course.
And this must be your wife, Sylvia.
- I don't know her.
- Trick or treat.
I specifically asked you not to tell anyone.
The way she spoke sounded as if she knew you were having a baby.
What?
You are?
Nice going, Frasier.
He is the master of deduction.
He would have figured it out anyway.
Just let it out.
I'm here for you.
I keep telling you, I'm not crying.
It's my damn lashes.
Courageous and beautiful.
You shouldn't be drinking this poison.
Here, Roz, drink this.
- Roz, do you have a tissue?
- lfyou don't see it, I don' t have it.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to get a napkin over here?
Hurry back, brave girl.
Just look at her, poor thing.
What are you talking about?
I suppose you'll find out.
- There's a baby on the way.
- You know about that, too?
- Who told you?
- I heard Frasier and Roz.
You don't seem very surprised.
I am fond of her, but she's no Sunday school teacher.
She's been around the block a few times.
Instead of heaping scorn on her, put the blame where it belongs.
On Frasier.
The shameless Casanova.
What's he got to do with this?
- He's the father.
- What?
- I heard it from his own mouth.
- I've got to go talk to him.
Wait.
I've just made a momentous decision.
There's one person in this family who still has a sense of honour.
Frasier may not be able to do right by her, but I will.
- What're you talking about?
- I'm going to propose to her.
Are you nuts?
You're still married.
Maris never needed me.
But there's a woman who does.
I didn't know you even liked her.
Yes, I wore that mask well.
It's time to do the honourable thing.
Divorce your wife and marry the woman who's carrying your brother's child?
I've made up my mind.
Nothing's going to stop me, Dad.
There's been a bit of an hors d'oeuvre mishap on your Persian rug.
Just call me Fumbles With Crab Puffs.
Not now, Gil.
There's no sense fretting about it until you know for sure.
My eyes are just getting worse.
I should ask Dr Crane to take me home.
I feel bad ruining his good time.
I was having fun, too.
There are some very attractive men here.
But who's going to want me in this condition?
Don't worry about Frasier.
He'll take care ofyou.
That's a laugh.
Beat it, Roz.
Never mind.
I have to go check my machine.
Daphne, we've known each other for four years now.
Wait.
I want to take the time to phrase this just right.
You take all the time you need.
I've got to go find your brother.
Dr Crane, can I talk to you for a moment?
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?
It's OK.
I'll go freshen my lipstick.
I feel naked without it.
Haven't you ruined my evening enough?
- What are you talking about?
- You and your blabbermouth.
You told Niles about the baby.
- I did not.
- Don't play innocent with me.
I don't mean to ruin your evening, but I can't stay.
Look at my eyes.
I am sorry for your condition, but you should have read the directions on the package before you used it.
I don't know why you're blaming this whole mess on me.
I just know I need a lift home right now.
All right.
I'm not leaving here until I get Eve's number.
So sit, have a drink, smoke a cigarette ifyou like.
I am attracted to her and I won't let you and your problem stand in my way.
That's enough.
Lower your voice.
You're embarrassing yourself.
I'm embarrassed that you're my brother.
You cad, you bounder, you rou√©.
What's wrong about trying to get her number?
We're not interested in your next conquest but about your last one.
And before you deny it, I have proof.
From here it smells like 80 proof.
A woman stands here before you in dire need.
I can find someone else who'll take me.
- lndeed you can.
- Niles Don't try to stop me.
You seduce this poor woman and then you aren't man enough to stand by her?
Before you make an ass Stop or I'll teach you a long overdue lesson in chivalry.
- But, Dr Crane, you - No, don't defend him.
There may be one bastard in this family, but as long as I have anything to say about it, your babywon't be another.
Daphne, - will you marry me?
- You drunken imbecile!
Daphne's not the one who's pregnant.
Roz is.
- Roz is?
- Who's Roz?
She's the one dressed like O. That was very gallant.
Perhaps you should propose to Roz.
If anybody's going to propose to Roz, it's Frasier.
How can you do that?
- It was Frasier?
- I am not the father of Roz's baby.
In fact, we don't even know for sure if there is a baby.
We do now.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Roz, how are you?
Still pregnant.
I'm sorry about last night.
I tried to apologise, but you ran out so fast.
I'm sorry.
Was that rude?
You know more about etiquette than I do.
What is the proper length of time you should stay after someone announces to 100 strangers that you got knocked up?
- I tried to call.
- I wasn't answering.
I was up all night thinking about what I want to do.
A decision ofthat magnitude would take many sleepless - I'm having the baby.
-hours to make.
Are you sure, Roz?
I know it's quick, but even when I was hoping I wasn't pregnant, I knew if I was, I was keeping the baby.
Then let me be the first to congratulate you.
It's so wonderful.
You'll make a great mom.
I did the first step pretty well and I wasn't even trying.
- Have you told the father?
- I called him at nine this morning, which was seven o'clock at night Cairo time.
Is that pertinent or are you dazzling me with your command oftime zones?
He's gone to Cairo.
He's an architect.
Wow.
Really?
- When's he coming back?
- He isn't.
That's fine with me.
I'm comfortable raising this child by myself.
And I'm sure everybody around here will give you plenty of support.
Roz, who's the proud papa?
You got it narrowed down yet?
That's nice.
Very nice.
- Frasier, would you excuse us?
- Of course.
Just remember the baby's future, Roz.
Try to make it look like an accident.
I was just kidding.
I'm sure you know who the dad is.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Do you remember Janet's party a couple of months ago?
You got really drunk and I drove you home.
Yeah.
What about it?
You invited me up, and I'd had a few myself - and the next thing I knew - No, I don't believe this.
I don't even remember us Just tell me you're joking.
We don't have to get married right away.
I thought you'd be happy about this.
I mean, we were wonderful together.
When you made love to me, you were so tender and caring Tender and caring?
No way was that me.
You almost had me.
Good one, Roz.
- Someone at the door.
- Really?
So that's what that chiming sound means.
I'm indisposed.
Would you mind?
Sure.
Sorry, Daph.
Hang on, she's coming.
You take it easy.
Rest up for that big trek to the dinner table.
Hello, Dr Crane.
Daphne, before I come in, I have to say I am mortified about my behaviour last night.
I don't know what got into me.
About a quart ofvodka, for starters.
There's no need for an apology.
I thought what you did was very chivalrous.
I believe if a woman finds herself in such a predicament, a man of honour has an obligation to do the right thing.
- And poor Roz is in that predicament.
- Do I smell chicken?
We'll be serving dinner as soon as Roz gets here.
I didn't think she should be alone.
How's she doing?
OK, considering she's decided to have the child herself.
Things have changed since my day.
Back then, if a girl got in trouble, herfamily'd ship her off to relatives and if anybody asked, just lied and said she went to Europe.
Then when she came back, they'd raise the baby as a little sister.
Not like today.
We had morals and values back then.
I assumed I'd have children, but if Maris and I don't reconcile soon, the issue will be moot.
She's older than I am.
and her biological clock is winding down.
Luckily she flies to Z√ºrich twice a yearto have it reset.
Babies are wonderful, but Roz does have a rough road ahead of her.
It can never be easy balancing a career with motherhood.
Where will she find a husband?
A kid needs a mother and a father.
That's Roz.
Now remember she came here to have a relaxing dinner, not to be reminded of the situation that she's in.
If she doesn't bring it up, we won't discuss it.
Agreed?
All right.
Daphne, you may answer the door.
Well, thank you.
Why don't I get a feather duster and a French maid's uniform?
That would teach them, wouldn't it, Daphne, and I would pick it out for you.
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Daphne.
Dinner's almost ready.
You just make yourself comfortable.
- That's such a cute skirt.
- Thanks.
I just got it.
I just got these pants.
They're nice.
I got some interesting news last night.
Well, I and a large portion of Seattle found out I was pregnant.
Don't you want to ask me about it?
Yes, of course we do, but we were told not to.
Frasier's afraid we might make you uncomfortable.
I want to talk about it.
I'm really excited.
I'm going to be a mom.
I've got a lot to do.
- One thing I've got to get pronto - A husband.
I was going to say a bigger apartment.
Maybe the husband'll have one.
How did the father take it when you told him?
- Don't worry, she brought it up.
- He took it very well.
He won't be that involved.
He moved to Cairo.
Where would he have moved to if he had taken it badly?
No, he's working in Cairo on a project.
He's an archaeologist.
Roz, why don't we get you something to drink?
- Do you have any mineral water?
- Eight kinds.
Come and pick one.
He's got room for all that water in that fridge, and I have to keep my can of spray cheese under the sink.
This morning you told me the father was an architect.
I did?
That was a slip of the tongue.
- How did you two meet again?
- In a bar.
- You told me it was on a double date.
- Yes, it was on a double date.
You told me nothing.
What is going on, Roz?
You're hiding something.
Niles, please, would you excuse us?
By all means.
I just came in to open a bottle ofwine.
Sorry.
Is it that you don't know who the father is?
Of course I know.
- Why don't you tell me?
- Because I haven't even told him yet.
I'm not sure I'm going to tell him.
It's complicated.
I don't care who he is but he has a right to know he's having a child.
- This isn't any ofyour business.
- It's certainly his business.
You have an obligation to let him know you're having his baby.
Niles, do you mind?
It's impossible to have a private conversation with you eavesdropping.
I resent the implication that I have nothing better to do than spy on you like a nosy teenager.
I came in for a corkscrew.
I'm sorry.
All I could get was she hasn't told the father.
- Double latte, please.
- I'll bring it over.
Thank you.
- Morning, Roz.
- Frasier?
What are you doing here?
It must be a shock to find me here in this place that I come to every day of my life.
- You had a dental appointment.
- I rescheduled it.
- Thanks for telling me.
- What's going on?
- I came here to talk to him.
- The father?
- I'm proud of you.
- Now get out of here.
- May I have that to go, please?
- Sure, Dr Crane.
- Roz, how are you doing?
- Good.
You?
- Great.
What can I get you?
- I'll have a decaf, thanks.
Thank you.
- He's a nice kid.
- Yes.
- Working to put himself through school.
- Yes.
- He's the father, isn't he?
- Yes.
The father ofyour child is a teenager?
He's not a teenager, anymore.
He had a birthday three weeks ago.
We just went out for a couple ofweeks, and then it was over.
It's embarrassing, though, him being seven years younger than I am.
Put your eyebrows down.
I've seen your driver's licence, and you don't weigh no 1 70.
Now you know what I'm talking about.
I don't want to ruin his life.
- He still has a right to know.
- I know that.
It won't be easy.
When you were in college, if a woman told you she was carrying your child, wouldn't you have been devastated?
In my case, I would've been mystified.
- How do I even begin to tell him?
- It's never easy.
So, Roz, what made you switch to decaf?
Then sometimes a natural opening does present itself.
Trying to stay healthy.
I called this morning and your number wasn't working.
I'm not in the dorms.
- Did you get your own place?
- No, I moved back in with my parents.
- Frasier, your dad's waving to you.
- Right.
Like my dad's waving to me.
My dad's over there waving to me.
Excuse me.
You look incredible.
- I do?
- Yeah.
Dad, what brings you here?
Sherry took her sister across the street to buy some foundation garments.
- I think they call them bras now.
- Not these you don't.
You could cross the River Kwai on one of those babies.
- I have something to tell you.
- I've got some news, too.
Remember that junior year abroad programme?
I'm in.
I am leaving next week and spending the rest ofthe year in Paris.
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
First my soccer team wins the championship, then I ace my finals, and now I'm going to Paris.
I'm starting to think, what's next?
Funny you should ask.
- There's something in my eye.
- I don't see anything.
- Are you sure?
- I don't see anything.
- You're not looking.
- All right.
No, don't touch!
Look, Dad, I've got to go talk to Roz.
Go to the men's room and rinse it with cold water.
I'm glad I worked all those extra shifts to put you through medical school.
- Roz?
- Don't worry, I told him.
- How did he take it?
- He was pretty freaked out.
I said I didn't need anything from him, and I was going to raise this baby by myself.
Anyway, he's going to be fine.
I'm late for a doctor's appointment.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Can I take you to dinner tonight?
Thank you, that would be nice.
I'll see you later.
I can't stand these yuppie joints.
Some bozo went through the bathroom correcting all the grammar in the graffiti.
Who can have that much time on his hands?
Unbelievable.
- It was Niles, wasn't it?
- I'll talk to him again.
It's open, Frasier.
I'm sorry.
I probably should have called first.
No, that's all right.
I'm just surprised to see you.
I'm surprised to be here myself.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
There was a card, but it kind of blew off on my way over.
I rode my bike.
- I acted like an idiot.
- It's OK.
No, it's not.
I mean, when you told me, all I could think about was myself and how it was going to affect me.
But once I calmed down, I started thinking about you and the Baby.
So, that's the other reason I'm here.
I'm not going to Paris.
I'm quitting school.
I'm going to work at the cafe full time.
So you've come to tell me you've lost your mind.
No, I came here to ask you to marry me.
Oh, Rick That's so wrong.
Yeah, that's right.
Roz, will you marry me?
No, the proposal was fine.
It was absolutely lovely.
- It's just that we can't - No, please.
Don't say no yet.
I have been thinking about this all afternoon.
And I could fall in love with you.
I could be a good husband, a good father.
Rick, that's the whole point of being 20.
You could be anything.
I'm much older than you are.
I am things.
I know what you're saying, but I'm not too young for this.
My mom was only 1 7 when she had me.
Your mother's only 37 years old?
And would you two hit it off.
I mean, you guys have a lot in common.
- Actually, you sort of even look alike.
- Stop right there.
Listen, your proposal was so sweet.
- It's my first one, actually.
- Mine, too.
You're so I hope that you can understand why I can't possibly marry you.
When I get married, it's going to be to someone I love, and someone who loves me, and someone who can legally drink champagne at my wedding.
OK.
I understand.
- So is?
- This is the sonogram picture.
I got it this morning.
Right there.
Wow, that dot's my kid.
No, that dot's just a dot.
That dot's your kid.
- You can have it ifyou want.
- Thank you.
I can send you photos, updates, that sort of thing, ifyou like.
I would like that.
Yeah, very much.
- Roz, are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
I think this is the right thing, for you and for me.
Now, go.
Go to Paris.
Go learn.
Go have fun.
Just don't come back wearing a beret.
- Take care ofyourself.
- You, too.
- I said go.
- But I just got here.
I'm sorry, Frasier.
Come in.
I ran into Rick in the hall.
He asked me to marry him.
- I said no.
- That was very sweet of him.
- I was making tea.
You want some?
- Yeah, thanks.
With milk, please.
Well, you've had quite a day, haven't you?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
It's OK to not be fine.
- Is it OK just to be OK?
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks, Roz.
This milk's expired.
Whoa.
It has.
That's all right, I can drink the tea straight.
I had no idea I let this milk expire.
It's really all right, Roz.
I can't take this.
How did I let this happen?
Are we still talking about the milk?
Don't you see?
Milk is a staple.
I let a staple go bad.
Good mothers don't let staples go bad.
How can I be responsible for a child when I can't even keep fresh milk in the house?
Kids need milk.
Roz, kids don't even drink milk for the first year.
See?
I didn't even know that.
I didn't know that either until I was a parent.
Don't you understand?
I have to know everything.
You could know half of everything, about the milk.
- Lilith could know about the booties.
- You never met Lilith, did you?
Just forget the milk and forget the tea and talk to me.
I don't knowwhere to start.
Everything in my life is about to change.
My body, my love life Yes, but it's also going to change in fantastic ways.
I remember the first night I brought Frederick home from the hospital.
You put this tinything into a tiny little bed, and you look around and you realise that the entire house has changed.
I know.
I want that.
But, God, the responsibility.
Well, yes, but it's all worth it.
You get to share your life with a remarkable little creature who only lives in the present, runs around naked without the slightest bit of shame.
Can entertain himself just staring at a shiny object.
- lsn't that wonderful?
- lsn't that Bulldog?
Well, technically, yes.
Roz, I'm going to tell you something l didn't find out until I became a father.
You don't just love your children.
You fall in love with them.
It's that same rush, that same overwhelming desire to see them, to hold them, bore other people to tears with every detail about them.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to have a baby.
Someone who's going to call out for mom and it's gonna be me.
I'm really scared.
What if I can't do this by myself?
But, Roz, you're not all by yourself.
- I'm here.
- Thank you, Frasier.
I'll be available in whatever way you wish.
From taking you out to dinner tonight to that moment in the delivery room when you saywelcome to the world, little Jimmy or little Sally or dare I hope, little Frasier.
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- I got carried away.
- No, I mean I'm going to hurl.
- Oh, dear God.
I'll wait here.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
-Hey, howareyou, Doc?
The usual?
- Please.
- I'll have my usual too.
- And thatwould be?
I come in every day.
You must remember.
My usual is a half-caf cappuccino - with a light dusting of - Nutmeg.
- Cinnamon.
- Got it.
God, that's infuriating.
- I come here as often as you do.
- Don't take it to heart.
This person remembers me best.
The next person might Oh, my God, you're Frasier Crane!
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- No, you can't.
It's never a bother.
- I love your show.
- Thank you.
I think you're the smartest guy on Earth.
Well, one does hear tales of a certain wise man in Tibet, but why split hairs?
- There you are.
- Thanks.
Where was l?
You were last seen hiking up Mount Ego.
Enough.
You've yapped about it all morning.
It's a stupid rule, and it's foreigners who suffer for it.
Another drive on the wrong side ofthe road?
No.
It's about my friend Xena.
You don't want to hear about it.
Hey, Dad.
- Xena.
The Greek woman?
- Yes.
We're planning a trip together.
Her mother's taking a cruise, and her ship will dock in Mazatlan for a week.
She's invited us to join her, only I can't go because my bloody passport's expired.
Don't give up hope.
We'll get you across that border.
If I have to, I'll snuggle you under an old blanket.
- Don't you mean smuggle?
- I'm using code language.
You can't be too careful.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am?
- Thanks.
I've already ordered.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
You had the - Absent-minded waiter.
I'll get it myself.
Roz called to remind you about your meeting with the station manager.
Yes, that.
He probably wants to discuss my 1,000th radio broadcast.
- It's next week.
- You've done a thousand shows?
Yes.
If I know the station manager, he'll want to mark it with a gaudy celebration/ press, parties, God knows what.
No, I've never gone in for that self-congratulatory hoopla.
- The work is the thing for me.
- Still, a thousand shows.
- That's quite an achievement.
- I suppose.
- Who'd have thought?
- Not me, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, those first two weeks, p.u.!
Open a window.
All right!
- Hey, morning, Roz.
- Morning, Bulldog.
Oh, my gosh!
Look what Frasier got for me.
He's so cute.
"Dear Roz, a huggy bear for the mom-to-be.
Love Bulldog"?
I guess I shoulda known you'd think it was from Frasier.
- I'm so sorry, Bulldog.
- It's OK.
I'm not the warmest guy in the world, but when it comes to kids I get kinda Oh, Bulldog, come here.
Come here.
Whoa, you're gonna make a good mother, Roz.
Thank you, Bulldog.
That's so sweet.
Bulldog?
- Oh, get off me!
- What?
You wanted to hug because my breasts are bigger!
No, I was just trying to feel a little kick.
Get out!
Pervert!
Morning, Roz.
I got you one ofthose muffins you love.
You're not getting a hug!
I see those mood swings have levelled off nicely.
I'll just go and have that meeting with Greg.
It's cancelled.
He wanted to talk about your 1,000th show, - but I ran into him and I handled it.
- All right, let me have it.
What kind of a circus am I in for?
I suppose a garish outdoor rally Iike the one they gave for Bob and Nipsy over at KTLK?
I told him just what you said, about how the work is its own reward.
So you're off the hook.
- They're not doing anything?
- Nope.
Well, well done, Roz.
That's a relief.
Although I'm not sure I'm being quite fair to you, you see.
I did hear that after that rally, Bob and Nipsy's ratings went up 30 per cent.
The producer got a handsome raise.
And you, with the little one coming - Well, it's too late now.
- Right.
Can't be helped.
Best to just leave it alone.
Still there is the benefit to the station.
What's good for KACL is good for all of us.
That's true.
I suppose you could call Greg and tell him I'd be willing, for your sake and the station's, to submit to a small, tasteful, Iow-key public rally.
I just want to renew my passport.
No, I'm a resident alien here from England.
You know, the country that used to own you people?
You'll go right to the head ofthe line now.
I can't wait two weeks.
Myfriend Xena's flying down to meet her mum's ship Sunday.
Don't you put me on hold again!
I'll hang up!
I mean it!
I showed him!
Well, it's official.
My 1,000th show is now an event.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing short of a media circus with you-know-who in the centre ring.
They're planning a promotional blitzkrieg, capped off by a public rally in my honour at the foot ofthe Space Needle.
Wow!
That's great!
You must be thrilled.
Of course I'm flattered.
I'm just a little bit embarrassed.
I'd be content with a pat on the back and an ice cream.
Dad, they've asked ifyou might say a few words at the rally.
You don't have to ifyou'd be nervous.
Oh, no problem.
I can't tell ya how many retirement dinners I've spoken at.
I've still got my old joke book, and Thigh-Slappers.
I'm sure you're a veritable chiropractor of mirth, but I think they're looking for something just a bit more personal.
Hello?
All right, Roz, slow down.
Oh, good Lord, the mayor?
Well, has Frasier Fever swept all the way to City Hall?
Well!
All right, Roz, I'll see you tomorrow.
- The mayor's going to be there?
- Yes.
And not just be there, he's going to present me with a key to the city.
And he's going to proclaim it Frasier Crane Day in Seattle.
Way to go, kid!
Who can this be?
Some mechanic from the Vatican with my Pope Mobile?
- Niles!
- Frasier, dinner's on me.
I got some very good news today.
Your brother just got some good news, too.
Not so good as mine, I suspect.
First, I have to apologise for being snippy this morning.
I felt eclipsed lately, but that vanished when I reached my office for what was waiting on my desk but a gift from the self-esteem fairy.
The American Journal of Psychiatry.
I refer you to the Letters page.
Third one down.
"Dear Sirs, Dr Egmont Sanderling's recent article on Trichotillomania contained several errors".
"He should read the ground-breaking work on the subject by Dr Alan Caldwell, Dr Milo Lauderstein" Skip to the end.
"Dr Geraldine Fennelly and Dr Niles Crane".
Not too shabby, eh?
That's quite an accolade.
Yes, I had no idea you were such a well-known expert on the thing the letter mentioned.
And the way they saved you for last so you stand out.
Nothing to kick away the clouds like a heady sip from the goblet of fame.
I told Jean-Claude to start my victory martini-shaking - at precisely eight o'clock.
- Offwe go then.
You had some news yourself.
Do tell.
Well, let's just wait for that martini, shall we?
Happy Frasier Crane Day.
Or is it Merry Frasier Crane Day?
I can never remember.
- Very amusing.
- I'll have a half-caf cappuccino.
Sorry I'm late.
I stopped halfway to listen to a jolly band of Frasier Crane Day carollers.
I tried to join in on The Twelve Days ofFrasier, but forgot the words around day seven.
How does it go again?
I believe it's "seven snobs a-sniping".
Snipe away.
I take your jealousy as the compliment that it is.
A little affectionate joshing doesn't mean I'm jealous.
- I'm nothing but happy for you.
- Thank you, Niles.
You know, I'm just a touch skittish today.
All this fuss over me.
Say, is it possible to get these two to go?
We're not due at the Space Needle for an hour.
I thought a walk might do us good.
Get a little exercise.
Then maybe I can stroll away my jitters.
OK, I could use the fresh air.
I feel a tad sluggish.
- Up late last night?
- I'm afraid so.
As usual, I left it to the last minute to write all my Frasier Crane Day cards.
What a lovely day.
I'm so glad we decided to walk.
- I feel calmer already.
- Hey, Doc, way to go!
I'm listening!
I just hope Dad doesn't get too nervous about his speech today.
I've been giving him little tips all week.
As Daphne tells it, you wrote the whole thing for him.
I did no such thing!
I added a bon mot or two, tidied up the language, removed any questionable material.
- Not a word of his left, is there?
- Not a comma.
I'm listening!
Here's a tip.
The ones with cameras are tourists.
They have no idea who you are, much less why you're listening.
The man clearly waved to me first.
- He didn't wave at you.
- He did.
- He was waving - Why are you even objecting?
for a cab to get away from the scary "listening" man.
I love this place.
Here you can feel the pulse of the city.
You know what I think when I see all these people here bustling about?
Low turnout over at Frasier Crane Day?
No.
I think that they're the reason I love this city.
- Stop waving.
- Nothing wrong with being friendly.
There is a difference between friendly and making a spectacle ofyourself.
That man tried to assault me with a fish!
Niles, get a grip!
For God's sake, you become hysterical over the littlest things.
My suede shoes.
You've spilled latte over them!
They're ruined!
I'm sorry.
And it was a half-caf cappuccino.
Why can no one remember that?
I'll have to replace them.
I'll look foolish otherwise.
Never have I heard such caterwauling over a pair of shoes.
I spent a bundle on these.
They're Joan and David.
- You named them?
- Oh, shut up!
Well, these are quite handsome, even if they're just a bit snug.
You can go back.
There's a pair you didn't try on.
Nonsense.
We weren't in there that long.
Oh, God, the rally's about to start.
Give me your phone.
I'll call Roz.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Hello?
Frasier, do you know what time it is?
Where the hell are you?
We're on the air in two minutes!
I'm sorry.
I was involved in a small accident.
I'm fine.
Just start without me.
We'll take a cab.
- We'll have better luck at the corner.
- Right.
Niles, wait!
Too many fans that way.
I'll be mobbed.
We're better off cutting over one block through that alley.
Frasier's running late, I've got to use you first, OK?
Yeah, sure, OK.
Geez, I was hopin' for a little more time.
I haven't even looked at the stuff Frasier wrote for me.
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome also to our radio listeners.
I'm Roz Doyle, and I'd like to thank you all for helping us congratulate Dr Frasier Crane.
We've got a full programme Stop worrying.
Dr Crane's a very good writer.
Look at this.
I'll die up there with this crap.
Sadly, our guest ofhonour has been detained, but we do have the next best thing, his dad, Martin Crane.
Thanks, Roz.
Good afternoon.
and asked if I would put him through medical school.
I agreed to pay for it, but remarked, "I should have my head examined.
" Frasier replied, "Give me eight years, and I'll do it for you.
" It was a hard eight years for Frasier, but as someone once quipped, "A good psychiatrist never shrinks from a challenge.
" Oh, geez For God's sake, Niles, come out of there.
Our mugger specifically instructed us to wait for five minutes.
If he'd intended us to time it exactly, he wouldn't have taken our watches!
All right, calm down.
I can see you're new to this whole mugging thing.
I can't believe I'm missing my own rally.
These shoes are killing me!
They're like the work of a skilled Chinese footbinder.
Niles, give me your phone.
I'll have Roz send us a car.
What do you think the mugger reached into my breast pocket for?
The only consolation is he jabbed himself on my emergency sewing kit.
Niles, a pay phone!
It's not much use to us unless we can find a quarter.
Niles, look.
You cannot be serious.
You want to rob that poor old man?
- We'll pay him back.
- He's blind.
I know.
It's the first break we've had today.
I'll distract him.
Good afternoon!
Sounding lovely.
- Stop!
Thief!
- Dear God, run!
I'd like to thank Frasier Crane for his friendship Excuse me, Mayor Rice?
- Yes?
- I have a small bone to pick with you.
I can't say I care for the way your city treats us poor aliens.
- You're an alien?
- Daphne Moon.
You see, my friend Xena and l She's an alien too want to get to Mazatlan to meet her mother's ship.
- Her mothership?
- Yes.
From what I hear, it's quite spectacular.
I'm sure it is.
Go with these two gentlemen.
- They can take care ofyou.
- Well, thank you very much.
- Hello.
Do you two work for the mayor?
- Yes.
I suppose I should know that already.
You see, I'm a bit psychic.
Stop, Niles!
Stop!
I can't go on any longer.
My feet are killing me.
We lost 'em.
Most ofthem dropped out after the first corner, but that short one with the pigtails was a regular gazelle.
Look, it's even farther away than it was before.
Frasier, the Monorail!
It goes to the Space Needle.
Let's go!
Welcome to the Seattle Monorail.
- Do you think anyone saw us sneak on?
- I think we're all right.
I hate to say it, but it was sort of exciting, flouting the law like that.
It gives you some idea of why outlaws are always such romantic figures.
You might have cut a more dashing figure had you vaulted the turnstile and not crawled underneath.
I'm surprised the trains are even running on Frasier Crane Day.
Yes, well, with any luck we'll still catch the last 20 minutes ofthe rally.
Though how I'll explain my lateness, I have no idea.
I certainly can't tell them about the fish, the little girls.
I can make something up, I suppose.
Any suggestions?
- The train stopped.
- That's not very original.
No, Frasier, the train stopped.
people to be open about it.
What's going on?
Excuse me, what's happening?
Electrical problem ahead.
We're going back.
What?
But those people are waiting for me.
- They're so close.
- I guess it just isn't your day.
But it is my day!
- Don't panic, Frasier.
- Oh, don't panic?
Yes, why should I panic?
I'm only missing a celebration in my own honour, making me a laughing stock.
And why?
- You spilled coffee on my shoes!
- You're blaming me?
Ifyou had the gripping ability every species above the tree sloth has You should think back on the 45 minutes you and your ego spent in that shoe store trying on every pair of shoes!
- Are you calling me vain?
- lfthe Joan and David fits!
I don't even know why I'm yelling at you.
I guess I'm just trying to blame you because I don't want to face the truth.
I'm a big fat phoney.
I wanted my day.
I wanted hoopla and fuss.
I practically planned the whole thing myself.
- You did?
- Yes.
Says a lot about me as a psychiatrist, doesn't it?
I'm a small man.
Well, what does it say about me that I was happy seeing you miss your day?
- You were?
- Of course.
I've been jealous ofyou all week.
I'm a tiny man.
- Next to me, you're a giant.
- I stare up at your ankles.
- I'd need a stepladder just to - Let's not do this.
You shouldn't feel guilty, Frasier.
Everyone deserves a fuss.
You above all.
You've helped a lot of people.
They deserve a chance to thank you for it.
Thank you, Niles.
Dr Crane is on his way and should be here any minute.
There it goes.
Goodbye, fuss.
Goodbye, day.
I hesitate to say this, but you still have time Stop it!
Don't you dare get my hopes up!
That ship has sailed, that fat lady has Taxi!
Taxi!
- Oh, damn!
I give up.
- Well, I don't.
This is your day, and if I can get you there for a curtain call, I will.
I still have the blind man's quarter.
I'll call a cab.
Thank you, Niles.
You're a good brother.
- Hey!
Did I hear you yellin' for a cab?
- Yes!
- I can take you if you want.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
- Niles!
Niles, let's go!
Come on!
- What about your friend?
- Oh, he'll be all right.
He's got street smarts.
- Where are we going?
- The Space Needle, please.
No problem.
Should be there in five minutes.
That's the first good news I've heard all day.
I've been having a pretty rough day myself.
Yeah.
My ex-wife is getting remarried tomorrow.
In Pennsylvania yet.
- You goin' to that rally over there?
- As a matter of fact, I am.
Told her I'd come to the wedding, but I've been getting cold feet.
Better make up my mind soon, though.
My plane leaves in a few hours.
They don't give you any bargains on those last-minute tickets either.
Maybe this isn't the best time to tell you but I'll have to owe you for this ride.
Don't worry about it.
Probably never should have gotten married in the first place.
We were young.
Had a few good years, though.
Well, that's something, at least.
At least the kids will be there tomorrow.
- Kids?
- Son and a daughter.
I don't see 'em much.
They went with their mom when we divorced.
Of course, I think I'm more excited about seein' them - than they are about seein' me.
- Why would you say that?
Just a feeling.
I didn't make much of my life back when Marie and I were together.
Turned it around, though.
I own this car.
Well, it's a nice one.
The hardest part is, if I do go, I have to see my in-laws.
They were never too crazy about me.
This new guy Marie is marrying is supposed to be some kind of big success.
I don't know what I'd say to any of them.
Part of me thinks I'd just be better off leaving the whole thing alone.
- And part ofyou doesn't.
- I'd like to see my kids.
Especially now they're getting a new dad.
Hell of a choice, huh?
You know, sometimes difficult choices like these can be good things.
They can teach us about who we are.
I've bent your ear enough about this.
Besides, we're here.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got plenty of time.
- Tell me more about your kids.
- All right.
- I'm John, by the way.
- I'm Frasier.
So long, Seattle, we love you!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Well, Karl, you've got two choices.
Either you have the tattoo removed, or you travel the globe searching for another soul mate named Fredwina.
We'll be right back after this.
I was going over this offer you got from the Siren Cruise Line.
- They wanna know - Roz.
- You know my policy on endorsements.
- Listen.
A celebrity entertainer cancelled on a cruise to Alaska.
They'll let us go for free ifyou fill in.
You have to give a brief lecture Roz, I'm a psychiatrist, not a huckster.
Some of us in this profession still believe in mahogany wainscoting?
Isn't that fabulous?
Look at those staterooms.
Not to mention the world-class health spa and gourmet chefs - It sounds tempting.
It's just - I know.
I don't think it's right to trade on one's good name for a free trip.
Plenty of people do.
Look, Zubin Mehta did one and General Schwarzkopf It says Gore Vidal did two ofthem.
Gore Vidal?
He hates everything.
Ifyou feel it would tarnish your image, I'll tell Vicki you decided to pass.
- Vicki?
Who's Vicki?
- She books the celebrities.
I met her at a party.
I was surprised she remembered me.
- We're on in 15 seconds.
- No, wait a minute.
- It's a favour for a good friend?
- She's not.
She means something to you.
You've put me in an awkward position.
- Frasier, I don't care - All right, I'll go!
This is the last time I pull your chestnuts out of the fire.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
You're looking very comfortable for afternoon.
I just love days like this.
Nothing to do, nowhere to go.
Although I have a nagging suspicion I've forgotten something.
Like getting dressed?
Oh, I could justwatch the rain all day.
When I was a little girl, I hated the rain.
Stuck inside, couldn't go out and play.
But my mum would always say, "Enjoy it while you can".
"There'll be no water in hell".
Course, that was her answer for everything.
"Eat your veggies.
There'll be no Brussels sprouts in hell".
"Have a lie down.
There'll be no naps in hell".
Daphne, I am a therapist.
If you'd like to talk about this sometime About what?
Nothing.
Wish I could remember what I forgot to do.
Well, you know what they say/ ifyou can't remember, it probably wasn't important anyway.
- Dad!
- Oh, no.
You're dripping!
That happens when you stand in the rain waitin' for your ride.
- Mr Crane, I am so sorry.
- What the hell were you thinking?
Venting emotion is good, but I've just had the floors waxed.
I said 4.00 on the corner of 2nd and Bell.
- You should have called me.
- I was afraid I'd miss you.
Good point, Dad.
Ifyou'd just step on this paper, please.
Perfect.
Oh, God, he's wet too!
No!
Damn him!
Daphne, Daphne, get this canine sprinkler out of here!
Don't be too cross with him, Dr Crane.
As me mum used to say, there'll be no dogs in hell.
I sincerely doubt that.
- Niles.
- Frasier.
Hey, Dad.
I'm returning your cookbook.
I won't need it.
I thought you were preparing an anniversary dinner for Maris.
Not this year.
Maris is flying to a clinic in the Alps for an experimental rejuvenation treatment.
Only one man performs the procedure, and she wants to see him before he's extradited.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's so depressing.
Every time we approach a breakthrough in our therapy, Maris runs away.
I hoped that spending time together on our anniversary would get us over the hump.
There, there, Niles.
I know it's difficult when someone puts their own selfish obsession above your emotional needs.
Here you are.
Take off that wet coat and stay for dinner.
I'll get us a couple of hot toddies like we used to make at Duke's.
Dad, you know, there's a recipe in this book for a hot toddy.
It calls for Courvoisier, camomile tea and a dash of Framboise.
Garnish it with a few rose petals, and that's just how Duke used to serve it.
Make yourself at home.
Poor Niles.
You know, Dad, maybe I should Stop!
I know what you're gonna say.
You wanna persuade Maris to spend her anniversary with Niles.
- I didn't realise I was so predictable.
- You are.
If you ask me Stop!
I know what you're going to say.
I should mind my own business, keep my big bazoo shut.
I was gonna say "fat yap", but you're in the ballpark.
When two people are arguing, their emotions can get the better of them.
- A third party can provide perspective.
- They have a therapist.
If Niles needs more help, he's got Dr Jim Beam here, and he makes house calls.
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Maris.
I hope you enjoy Switzerland.
I have plans of my own for our anniversary that I'm very excited about.
That's a healthy approach.
What are your plans?
I thought I'd sit in my cavernous apartment, rocking back and forth while hugging my knees.
Now, Niles, you're not gonna be alone on your anniversary.
You'll have us.
Well, actually, I've agreed to give a lecture on a cruise to Alaska.
But I don't see a reason why you two shouldn't join me.
- That'd be great, wouldn't it, Niles?
- I don't know.
Come on, it'd take your mind offyour troubles.
I appreciate it, but whisking me off on a cruise I'm not as emotionally fragile as all that.
As you wish.
Well, Dad, it'll just be you and me then.
- Yeah.
When do we leave?
- Fourteenth.
The fourteenth?
You know, that just gets funnier and funnier each time you do it.
No, no, I'm wrong.
Hey!
Some ship, huh?
How's your stateroom?
I'd hardly call it a stateroom.
Wouldn't even call it a room, but I don't know the nautical term for "broom closet with sconces".
- How's yours?
- The same.
Worse.
I'm sure you have a better view from your porthole than I do.
- You have a porthole?
- What difference does it make?
- A cabin's just a place to shower - You have a shower?
All I have is a nozzle and floor drain.
It took me an hour to put them together.
The buffets come at a good clip, so you gotta pace yourself.
And watch out for your fillers, your breads, your rolls, your chips and dips.
You've only got so much room.
Don't be a hero.
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!
Hey, Fras, this is great!
You got one of those cabins where the whole bathroom turns into a shower?
Yes.
Before you say it, I had no idea what Spartan conditions we were in for.
That's all right.
Once I got over my fear that I'd be hauled below decks and manacled to another oarsman, I started to enjoy myself.
I won't spend much time in my cabin.
I'll hobnob with my fellow celebrities.
They got a lot of big names on board.
Did you see the pictures?
"Live and in person/ radio star Dr Frasier Crane".
- How about that?
- That's embarrassing.
I don't care for "star", considering the calibre of the others on board.
"The comedy stylings of Giggles O'Shea".
Oh, yes, you're in stellar company.
Look, they even managed to snare a magician/ "The Amazing Lance Gould".
Oh, he's great!
I caught his act in Reno a few years ago.
For his finale, he made his own head disappear.
Did the toupee go, too, - or did it just hover?
- Dear God!
You've booked me on a floating Gong Show!
- What happened to Mehta and Vidal?
- I am so sorry, Frasier, I had no idea.
I guess they just book A-list celebrities on big ships.
Attention, please.
The Taste of Alaska buffet is served on the Lido Deck.
That's my cue.
You guys comin'?
- Dad, we had a big lunch at home.
- Rookie mistake.
See you at dinner.
It's not that bad.
At least you got top billing.
Of course I got top billing.
- I'm the only one there I've heard of!
- What about him?
"Latin Singing Sensation Carlos 'The Barracuda' Del Gato"?
Remember him from the '70s?
He invented that dance craze, the Barracuda.
Believe it or not, Maris was a big fan of his.
- No.
- That was the one dance she could do.
The Hustle was too strenuous.
She had no booty to shake but her fetching little underbite was just perfect for the Barracuda.
Niles, why is that woman staring at you?
God help me!
It's that awful Mimi Cosgrove from the country club.
Hide me!
She's a man-eating lush who'd go - Niles?
- You little good-for-nothing Mimi!
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, looking for the bar.
Oh, there it is.
- Let me buy you a cocktail.
- Oh, you know I don't know what it is about the ocean that makes me so thirsty.
Have you been working out?
Look, there he is.
The Barracuda.
How thrilling!
A fellow headliner on the USS Has-been.
Oh, shut up.
Come on, let's go over my notes for my lecture.
Dr Frasier Crane?
I am Carlos Del Gato.
Hello.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is Roz Doyle.
- Buenas noches.
Habla espanol?
- Oh, not really.
It's no matter.
I am sure you are schooled in the international language.
Oh, yes, Roz.
Say something amusing in Esperanto.
Each night I select the most beautiful woman in my audience and present to her a red rose.
This means the evening has just begun.
Perhaps one night you will be my especial lady.
Until then OK, you're right.
We're on the voyage of the damned.
- So, are you still separated?
- I'm afraid so.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Well, we're trying.
- We're in therapy.
- Oh, good.
You know how much I've always thought of you and - Maris.
- Yeah, an angel.
If there's any way I can be of comfort to you, why, you just let me know.
- What is that marvellous fragrance?
- That's Pardon, sir.
The lady sends you this with her compliments.
- What lady?
- There in the black dress and veil.
- Maris!
- There was one more thing.
Yes?
I'm sorry, sir, but she gave me the biggest tip I've ever seen.
I'm sure you can convince Maris this is all completely innocent.
If not, I'm in cabin 712.
What happened?
Was that Maris I saw running out?
She saw Mimi pawing me and assumed the worst.
- How upsetwas she?
- I couldn't see past the outfit.
Who wears a black dress and veil on a cruise?
She has no pigmentation.
Three minutes in the sun, she'd sear like an ahi tuna.
She's supposed to be in Switzerland.
Why's she here?
Niles, Niles, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that this may be partly my fault.
You see, I left a message on her machine saying how upset you were and it might be fun if she could join us on the cruise.
- You invited her and didn't tell me?
- I thought itwould be a nice surprise.
Oh, well, it worked out perfectly!
She's probably arranging to fly home from the next port.
The lady who sent me the champagne, do you know which room she's in?
No, sir, but she asked me to give you a message.
Just out of curiosity, how much are these running her?
You're on in 20 minutes.
How's your speech coming?
It's hard to concentrate.
I'm so concerned about Niles.
I like this opening joke you wrote.
It's very funny.
Thank you.
I can't take all the credit.
I had a patty melt with Giggles before his show.
Oh, Niles, I can't tell you again how sorry I am for meddling.
- How did it go with Maris?
- Terribly.
This is without a doubt the most depressing night of my life.
That is so fun I'm sorry.
I looked for her for hours.
I remembered her fondness for the Barracuda.
In the lounge, that Latin cheeseball was crooning his ghastly song to her.
I approached, then a waiter came over.
By the time I got the champagne out of my eyes, she had disappeared.
I waited after the show.
She didn't come out.
Neither did Del Gato.
- What are you implying?
- You know her taste for revenge.
If she thinks I'm having an affair with Mimi, she'll tryto punish me in kind.
Wow!
Do you reallythink she's planning to do the Barracuda?
Niles, don't jump to conclusions.
That's exactly what Maris did.
Says a lot about our marriage.
No trust on either side.
What hope is there for us?
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, you've done enough.
I'm just going to take a walk.
Oh, God.
Oh, I feel so guilty.
When will I learn to stop interfering in other people's affairs?
I better go talk to Maris and see if I can fix this.
- Are you gonna butt in again?
- What business is that ofyours?
- There's your dad.
- Oh, no.
If he finds out, I'll never hear the end of it.
Boy, that Taste of Alaska spread was a bust.
Wanna know what caribou meat tastes like?
Not chicken.
- Where's Niles?
- He's out for a walk.
Oh, I may as well tell you the whole thing.
Maris is on board.
She and Niles had a horrible fight and their marriage is in worse shape than ever.
- No need telling you how she got here.
- I know, I know.
- What was I thinking, inviting her?
- You invited Maris?
Niles was so upset about being alone on their anniversary.
It seemed like a good idea.
Smart, huh?
I give you all this guff about buttin' in and then I turn round and do the same damn thing.
Oh, Dad, don't be too hard on yourself.
- Frasier?
- Oh, all right!
- I invited Maris, too.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- I told you to keep your bazoo shut!
Oh, you're one to talk!
- What are we gonna do now?
- Nothing at all.
Let them resolve their own differences.
- Stay on the sidelines where we belong.
- Right.
- Better get going.
I'll miss dinner.
- Dad, my lecture's in 15 minutes.
Oh, jeez.
Well, I guess I can't do everything.
Tell me how it went at the midnight buffet.
- We better go to your lecture.
- Right.
- First, I'm gonna go talk to Maris.
- You just said - Forget what I said!
You come too.
- I don't know her.
- You can vouch for Niles' innocence.
- All right.
I'm curious to meet her.
- I've never seen her face.
- I haven't seen her most recent one, so this'll be a new experience for both of us.
All right, now listen, let me do all the talking.
If it looks like she has an orange Abyssinian on her head, don't stare.
That's a wiglet.
All through.
Have a nice evening.
Damn.
She must not be here.
What are you doing?
You can't go in.
- I just want to see the room.
- You can't barge into someone's room.
My God!
Is that a grand piano?
- Frasier, look.
- Barracuda's calling card.
He's chosen Maris to be his Especial lady.
She's coming.
Why are we hiding?
You came here to talk to her.
You can't extol the virtues of trust to someone whose room you've broken into.
She's coming!
Oh, dear God!
- The shower is bigger than my cabin!
- Shut up!
Martin!
- Why are you here?
- We came to talk to Maris.
- Why are you here?
- The same as you.
- Why did you come in the bathroom?
- Well, what do you think?
- Oh, all right.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
It's Maris.
What's the big deal?
Why don'twe go out and talk to her?
We can't.
She may not be alone.
Remember the rose?
Oh, God.
Oh, I don't see her.
Maybe she went back out.
Oh, wait, I see her coat on a hat rack.
Look closer.
Is the hat rack moving?
- Oh my God!
- What's she doing?
- She seems to be alone.
- That's good.
- She's pouring champagne.
Two glasses.
- That's bad.
She's putting on music.
Do the barracuda Oh, that's bad.
On so many levels.
She's coming this way.
Shut up!
Shut up!
She's gone.
How are we gonna get outta here?
No idea, but I've got three minutes before I have to be downstairs - or 200 people will be disappointed.
- 200 people?
Where'd you hear that?
They told me that was the room capacity.
Oh!
Oh, come on!
Giggles had to add a show.
She's gonna hear us.
- It's the Barracuda.
- Who's the Barracuda?
A sleazy singer Maris is gonna sleep with - to get back at Niles for kissing Mimi.
- Who's Mimi?
A horny boozer and this predicament's Mrs O'Leary's cow.
- Who's Mrs O'Leary?
- A woman in Chicago who Later!
I haven't got time.
We must stop her before she damages her relationship forever.
We cannot go out there now.
We don't want to walk in on them.
I don't want to see that.
I just ate caribou.
Oh, very well.
It seems I'm the only one who really cares about this.
I will go.
Maris, what a lovely bathroom!
What are you doing here?
We came to convince Maris nothing was going on.
What are you doing here?
Maris and I ran into each other.
We had a talk and she invited me for champagne.
Oh, that's great, Niles.
It might mar the mood a bit if she finds you spying on her.
- Did you use that mouthwash?
- No, no, Maris did.
My God!
She's in the mood for more than champagne.
You've got to leave.
Give me time to see her out to the balcony.
A balcony?
Count to ten and then scram, so Maris and I can celebrate the way a man and his wife were meant to.
She started without me.
Drinking the champagne.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
-Morning, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.
Foryou.
A little token ofthanks.
Afteryou cutthose new promos, Dr Frank on KTLK practically vanished from the radio.
I'm not good at picking out gifts, butwhen I sawthis in the window I knew itwas perfect foryou.
Maybe I should've gone with the shawl.
It's not the purse.
Although I do hate it.
I don't even know why I'm crying.
It's the pregnancy.
A soup of hormones churns through your body and your emotions are rising and falling - at the slightest provocation.
- That's idiotic.
- All right.
Is something else going on?
- Last night was a disaster.
- Right, your date.
- Everything was fine and when he tried to order me a drink I told him I was pregnant.
You didn't tell him before the date?
It's not the easiest thing to tell someone.
I was hoping my radiant glow would do the talking for me.
Your glow?
Roz, do you really think that anyone could miss your glow?
So, I tell him, and he says fine, it's not a problem.
Five minutes later his pager is vibrating.
He has an emergency.
He has to go to work.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
- He sells wicker furniture.
Who needs their end tables re-caned at 9.30 at night?
I owe you an apology, Roz, it's not the hormones.
You're embarking on a life-changing journey.
Anybody would be emotional.
I think you're handling it beautifully.
Thanks, Frasier.
I'm fine.
I just need to go back to work.
My pen is out of ink.
Let's not discount the hormones altogether.
Hello, I'd like to return this purse.
I'm terribly sorry but this was a sale item and we have a no-return policy.
- Your wife didn't like it?
- I'm not married.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
No girlfriend.
I don't have time to go into my other non-existent relationships.
It was a gift for a friend.
Perhaps your "friend" would like to make it work with some matching shoes.
- We have up to size 13.
- This really was a gift, and I would thank you when you say the word "friend" not to italicise it.
Excuse me, sir, I couldn't help overhearing.
- May I help you out here?
- You hold her down, I can do the rest.
Hopefully, that won't be necessary.
Jill, we're all reasonable people.
Why don't you just give this gentleman a store credit?
I don't make the rules.
But a shrewd saleswoman such as yourself knows that this business isn't about rules.
It's about relationships.
Look at this man.
Cultured, impeccably dressed.
The sort of man you'd love to have a relationship with.
There's one thing standing in the way ofthat relationship.
- He's not happywith his purse.
- It's not my purse.
Maybe his purse was the wrong colour.
Maybe it didn't hold enough.
It's not my purse.
If he walks away unhappy, he may never shop here again.
And who knows what he might have bought in the future?
Scarves, gloves, hosiery.
The choice is yours, Jill.
The commissions that come from a lifelong relationship, orthe hollow satisfaction of knowing you followed the rules?
OK, I'll go get the forms.
Thank you.
That was very impressive.
You should see me return something hard like a house or a kidney.
The secret is persistence.
- I'm Frasier Crane.
- Samantha Pierce.
Sam.
- Are you Dr Frasier Crane?
- Yes, I am.
I thought your voice sounded familiar.
For a while, I thought you were the "white zone is for loading and unloading only" guy.
I get that a lot.
Sam, may I thank you bytaking you to dinnertonight?
That's very sweet ofyou, but I was just trying to be a good Samaritan.
- Thanks anyway.
- No, thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Oh, Sam?
- OK.
I'd love to go to dinner.
- That's wonderful.
- See?
Persistence pays off.
I was going to ask you to get my parking validated.
But this works out very well, too.
- What are you doing?
- Just watching football with you.
- What's the score?
- 27-20.
Great.
- Want to know who's winning?
- Not particularly, no.
Someone has a special evening planned.
What tipped you off?
My incredible self-confident air?
No, your silver collar pin.
You only wear it when you've got a hot date.
Good work getting all the tarnish off.
It shined up quite nicely.
- Evening, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
Dad, Frasier.
- You ready to go?
- Give me a minute.
Niles, I can't make it to the boat show with you and Dad.
- lt'll just be the two ofyou.
- Too bad.
Well, maybe some other time.
Goodness.
It is a clear night.
It's been rather windy lately.
- Look at those stars.
Is that Orion?
- Yes, I believe it is.
What are you doing?
We have a mutual support pact.
When there's a Dad event, we're there for each other.
I have a date with a spectacular woman.
So what?
I gave up Traviata tickets to support you at a tractor pull.
I thought we could stop at that medieval restaurant for dinner.
Sounds great, Dad.
Daphne, would you like to use my ticket for the boat show tonight?
That would be nice.
Very crafty.
Who's the lucky lady?
Her name is Samantha Pierce.
We just met yesterday.
She recognised me from my radio show.
In fact, when I asked her out, I sensed a shyness which made me wonder if she was intimidated by my fame.
Did you say Samantha Pierce?
- Short blonde hair, blue eyes?
- Right.
She's on Larry King.
We're here with noted attorney Samantha Pierce.
Currently she's trying a case in Seattle defending "The Butcher Knife Killer".
Sam, do you think being in the public eye, dating some of the world's most famous men, affects the way jurors perceive you?
That's not really fair, Larry.
I don't date public figures.
What about the much-publicised relationship with Kevin Costner?
Just a rumour.
- George Stephanopoulos?
- A rumour, too.
- Brad Pitt is another rumour?
- Yeah, but I started that one.
I can certainly see how she'd be intimidated by your fame.
I thought her name sounded familiar.
I must have read it.
Congratulations.
You're playing in the big leagues now.
Kevin Costner, Stephanopoulos, you Don't let him shake your confidence.
You'll be fine.
Maybe she's had her fill of attractive men and is ready for a change.
Aren't I lucky?
Normally a troll like me has to trick a woman to get a date.
I once dated a man who had gone out with several of the top British actresses but got sick of their vanity and insecurity.
See, it does happen.
After he got through slumming, he dumped me and went back to actresses.
He did get me a signed picture of Helena Bonham Carter.
She's riding a pony.
Teddy Kennedy, Henry Kissinger and the Dalai Lama are on this plane - I think I've heard this joke.
- No, this really happened to me.
Well, don't I feel silly.
Never mind, it's not a very good story anyway.
- How's your appetiser?
- It's delicious.
- Your salad?
- It's very good.
Actually, I haven't even tried it yet.
I was right.
I hope this doesn't offend you, but I've had a stressful day, and I don't have the energy to make small talk.
Plus, I'm not very hungry.
Would you mind terribly ifwe just?
I know where this is headed.
You don't have to say it.
Frasier, could we just go someplace and have sex?
Well, that you did have to say.
I'm sorry.
That sounded forward.
But it's the only thing I want to do right now.
I'm flattered and the thought is very tempting, but on my show I'm constantly preaching that people should get to know one another, have things in common before taking that kind of step.
- What's your favourite colour?
- Blue.
Mine, too.
Check, please.
- How was the boat show?
- It was wonderful.
They had this great exhibit where you climb into this boat, put on a life jacket and they simulate what it's like to be caught out at sea in a hurricane.
Niles, why did you ever agree to go on a ride like that?
I didn't.
I dined at the snack bar.
I guess this wasn't a very hot night for you, huh?
Home by 10.30?
Found my bra.
This is embarrassing.
Not at all.
No, Sam, this is my brother, Dr Niles Crane, and my father, Martin Crane, and his healthcare worker, Daphne Moon.
I've been watching the trial on TV.
It's fascinating.
For us, too.
I'd better get going.
I have an early morning.
Lovely meeting all ofyou.
- I had a wonderful evening.
- So did l. Good night.
- I'm off to bed.
- Not so fast, mister.
I can tell by that goofy smile ofyours that you're smitten.
Thank you, Niles, but I am not some dewy-eyed teenager.
She did say the cutest things.
She said murderers often show no remorse for their actions because they have no moral centre.
It was cute the way she said it.
I want you to taste this and tell me what you think.
That is spectacular.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Just a little something I picked up as a child at sauce camp.
Hello.
What?
When did this happen?
Because we're expected to give full disclosure.
Can't Brendan handle it?
All right.
I suppose you know what I'm about to say.
You want to skip dinner again and go straight to sex?
I'm sorry, Frasier.
I really am.
You went to all this trouble.
Fine French cooking is always better after a night in the fridge.
We just came back to get our umbrellas.
- No, stay.
- I've been called back to work.
- Don't let a good meal go to waste.
- Morel mushroom and tarragon sauce.
How did you know?
Niles can identify a sauce from a great distance.
His mother and I were so proud.
If it's not too late, maybe I'll be able to come back over after.
- Either way I'll call you.
- That's what you said yesterday.
I told you I was sorry about that.
I promise I'll call.
Shame.
And after you cooked that lovely meal.
Let me tell you something, crown roast does not prepare itself.
It's funny.
As much as I care for this woman, there's something about this relationship that leaves me unsettled.
I might venture a theory at which you're sure to hoot.
What may be making you uncomfortable is that you find yourself in the more submissive role.
What are you talking about?
I think what he means is you're the girl.
Think about it.
How did you two first meet?
She came to your rescue.
Who initiated the first sexual encounter?
She did.
She did?
Who's wearing the pants in this relationship?
As much fun as it must be for you to spin out this little theory, it's without foundation.
There's my rosemary bread.
If it's any consolation, I know what you're going through.
Women have put up with it for generations.
Men say they'll call, and they don't.
Or you get a few nice dinners and then the eventual booty call.
I did not get a booty call.
What's a booty call?
A late-night call inviting you to meet, but with the goal of just having sex.
I did get a booty call.
Frasier, you should nip this thing in the bud before it gets out of hand.
We don't have to look beyond our own family to find an example of someone who let a woman run the show from the start and has been paying for it ever since.
Poor Uncle Frank.
I'm wasting my time fighting you.
You can take any detail from this relationship and twist it to support your ridiculous theory.
I saw a guy selling these.
I thought they'd cheer you up.
They're beautiful.
- You are so - Really got to run.
I suppose now you're going to read something into this.
- I really love that tie.
- You should.
You sent it to me.
Oh, yeah, right.
- Your secretary picked it out.
- He has better taste than I do.
Don't worry about tonight.
I know how boring these parties are and I promise we won't stay long.
Sam.
Meet our senior partner, Daniel Gill.
How are you?
Sam, they're ready for us on that conference call.
It'll just take a minute.
You're new.
I'm Frasier.
I'm Jennifer, Stewart's wife.
This is Cindy Dolce.
She's married to Bob.
Terri Bailey.
She's living with Ed.
And Vanessa Saint-Claire, soon to be Mrs lrving Lumpowsky.
Good heavens.
How long have you and Sam been seeing each other?
About three weeks.
We haven't been able to get much time together but she assures me that'll all change as soon as the trial's over.
There's always another trial.
But you'll get used to the life.
Dates getting cancelled, dinners left uneaten.
But at least you'll get sent plenty of flowers.
Jennifer, he's a man.
He won't get flowers.
Sam, could I have a word with you in private, please?
Is there something wrong?
It's not the best time to bring this up, but I feel an uneasiness about this relationship.
What do you mean?
I'm not one to get bogged down in male-female role playing.
It's just that lately Take our first date.
We'd barely begun dinner when you suggested we go to bed together.
Traditionally, that is every man's dream.
OK, bad example.
But then you cancel dates all the time and you say you'll call and you don't.
And you have your secretary send me a gift and when I get upset about it, you think you can buy me offwith flowers.
Is that it?
That's what you dragged me out here for?
I'm in the middle of the most intense case of my career.
A man's life hangs in the balance and you're whining about flowers?
- Whining's a little strong.
- Well, tell me what you mean, Frasier.
Ifyou were the one working late hours, breaking dates and sending gifts, - would that be OK?
- No, that's not it.
You're a psychiatrist.
Shouldn't you be above all ofthis?
I'm just telling you how I feel.
Do you want to be the traditional man - and I'll be the put-upon woman?
- No, that's not what I want.
I just wish we could have a relationship where neither one of us is the man.
So that would make us what?
A lesbian couple?
They're very in now.
Frasier, I know no one likes being stood up.
I'll try to be more understanding.
And I'll try to stop being so damn emotional.
I'm glad we had this talk because I was about to make a big mistake.
What?
The other day when we were in the store you mentioned you liked something, and, typical me, I just ran right out and bought it.
Sort of dodged a bullet there, didn't we?
So what was it?
This.
And you bought this for me?
I'm really rather embarrassed, Frasier.
You were right.
I take relationships for granted, and then I just run offto Cartier - and buy a gift to make up for it.
- Cartier?
No, I'll return it, I promise.
I know how strongly you feel.
Maybe I've been a bit self-absorbed lately.
You're a person who likes to express their affection by buying gifts.
Who am I to stand in your way?
It's lovely.
Frasier, it isn't about the gifts.
I give gifts because I can never think of the right words.
Is this what you're trying to say?
Very well put.
Let's get out of here.
I'll get our coats.
No, I will get our coats.
- You don't know where they are.
- All right.
You get them.
I'm so bored.
What time is it?
Time?
Let's just have a look.
Isn't that fabulous?
It's Cartier.
Sam gave it to me.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Half-caf latte, please.
- I like this new system.
It's lively.
- What can I get for you?
I'll have a double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
- Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
I think there was a problem.
The middle person reversed part of it.
She said double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
No, you did it again.
That's not what I want.
You can just tell her yourself.
A double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
- Nutmeg?
- Nutmeg?
No, thanks.
It inflames my stomach lining.
Inflames his stomach lining.
Stop that.
- Hello, Niles.
- Welcome back.
I trust you and Samantha had a pleasant weekend?
It was fabulous.
We stayed at this gorgeous cabin just outside Aspen, took a chopper every day up the mountain.
I didn't want it to end.
Is that why you're still wearing that jacket in an overheated cafe?
In Aspen we all wear them indoors.
The funniest thing happened.
Jack Nicholson and Tom Brokaw were wearing the same jacket, so they staged a fight.
Donna Karan flew in to referee.
I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my toddy on someone named Boof Daddy.
Can I get anything else?
A dustpan and broom to sweep up some of these names.
Cappuccino, please.
- Niles, did we have plans for tonight?
- Yes, why?
It's my one-month anniversary with Sam.
I'd like to take her to L'Escalier.
I understand.
One month is a milestone.
Thanks for the reminder.
I need to change my water filter.
They put nutmeg on this.
Meg Ryan told me about the practical joke Tony Hopkins played on Jodie at the wrap party for Lambs.
My stomach lining is just not going to get a break today, is it?
- Sorry I was late.
- That's all right.
I ordered us the "Taste of Monaco" dinner.
Good choice.
That's what you ordered on our first date.
Of course, it wasn't food you were craving that night.
You whisked me away back to my place before the crab cakes could even arrive.
There's no better way to celebrate an anniversary than with an historical re-enactment.
I've got my costume on underneath.
I'm really looking forward to those crab cakes.
Great.
Well, yes, I suppose we should try the food here once.
But leave some room.
You'll find a Frasier mint on your pillow later.
By the way, thanks again for this weekend.
You're welcome.
I think it was a turning point for us.
Well, for me.
See, I was so relaxed.
I'm usually very tentative.
I have this dark fear that I'm about to be cut loose.
- Frasier?
- I'm just being so insecure.
It's nice to know I'm on solid ground.
- Frasier - I'm standing on quicksand, aren't l?
I didn't want to talk about this until later.
It's It's just not working out between the two of us.
No, it's not you.
It's me.
I just don't feel the same way about us anymore.
But things were going so well.
What happened?
Nothing happened.
We've had a wonderful time together.
It's just run its course.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
- I hope we can still be friends.
- Yes, I'd like that, too.
Seeing as how we're friends and all, there's no reason we shouldn't enjoy what's sure to be a splendid meal.
- Absolutely.
- Great.
OK.
- Your first course.
- Thank you.
- How many more courses are there?
- Six, sir.
Could you bring those all at once?
Good Lord.
Look at this headline.
"Martin Crane Dead".
You don't need much coffee after that.
- Handsome fellow.
- Yeah.
Multi-millionaire.
Decorated war hero.
Wrote a spy novel.
"Survived by his wife Florence, a former Miss Washington and two sons, Joe, a Marine Corps colonel, and professional baseball player Mickey Crane".
Nothing like starting the day off jealous of a dead guy.
- Hello, all.
- Morning, Dr Crane.
- You were up and out early today.
- I felt like taking a walk.
Got a lot on my mind.
Picked up some pastries.
Whatever it is, you'll cheer up when you see these photos from your ski weekend.
I admit, I took a peek.
I must say, this Sam ofyours is quite a catch.
She's gorgeous, smart, stylish - We broke up last night.
- Orange juice, anyone?
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was a mutual decision.
A little more mutual on her part than mine.
Once she dumped me, I jumped right on board.
- Anyway, I'll be fine, Dad.
- Just put it all behind you.
Exactly.
I must admit, I'm having a little difficulty achieving closure.
Sam said that herfeelings changed for no reason.
I think it might have been something specific about me.
- Don't make this your fault.
- She's probably telling the truth.
If she's trying to spare your feelings, it'll be "It's not you, it's me".
- That's exactly what she said.
- Waffles, anyone?
You always look for explanations but sometimes there isn't one.
I know, Dad.
It's going to drive me crazy.
Until I know why it ended, I'll assume it was any number of things.
- My self-confidence will be shattered.
- You got two choices.
You can spend days trying to figure it out.
Or you can make a clean break, never talk to her again, and get on with your life.
That's exactly what I should do.
Thank you.
- No problem.
- Sometimes you're very insightful.
I've been around the block a few times.
- So when are you going to talk to her?
- Right after my waffles.
Sam!
What are the chances?
You've found my thinking place.
Frasier, listen, I'm ten minutes late for a deposition.
- We can walk and talk.
- All right.
I love our new arrangement.
This being friends thing's going to work out great.
Could you pick up the pace a little?
- How have you been?
- I just saw you last night.
Now that you bring up last night You do walk fast.
I was hoping for a little clarification.
This has nothing to do with you.
Yes, but it seems highly unlikely that such a sudden change could have nothing to do with me.
Maybe itwas something that I did unintentionally.
I'm not sure.
Sorry.
My fault.
Something this weekend maybe?
I played the piano too long, but who knew General Schwarzkopf loved show tunes?
All right.
There's nothing I'm not telling you.
Sometimes things just end.
Please try not to take it so personally.
- All right.
- Look, I really am late.
I'll talk to you soon, OK?
Take care.
What's the matter with you?
That's just it.
I don't know.
Where is Frasier?
He knows we have reservations at Bavetta's.
Ifyou're late, they make you sit in the kitchen with the owner's mother.
What did I do with that remote?
Daph, are you sure you haven't seen it?
- Positive.
- They ought to make one with a sensor.
Or for a deaf person, they could make one with purple smoke coming out of it Iike some kind of flare system or something.
Please!
You've got to get out of the house more.
Hello, all.
Niles, what a pleasant surprise.
Just what Mama Bavetta will say when we pull up a chair.
Dinner.
I completely forgot.
I took a long walk after work.
I'm sorry, Niles.
It must have slipped my mind.
You're still consumed with the Sam situation?
- Trying to figure out what happened.
- The relationship ended.
- There's got to be a reason.
- You're fixated.
I am not.
That is fixated.
Dad, what are you doing?
This is stupid.
Maybe if I stick together about ten chopsticks, put a rubber tip on the end for gripping.
- Hello.
- Be ready in a sec, Roz.
- The movie doesn't start till eight.
- I forgot you two had plans.
I was wondering No, I don't know why Sam broke up with you.
Just like I didn't know two hours ago.
Just like Gil, Bulldog and Miss Judyfrom the Arts and Crafts Hour didn't know.
Never hurts to ask.
Miss Judy had some real insights before she had to make her Popsicle stick run.
- I'm going to watch the game at Duke's.
- Wait.
I'd like to ask a favour.
In the spirit of self-improvement, I'd like you to tell me in your own words what about me you find unlovable.
Please, honestly, for the sake of my future relationships.
I know you're afraid to hurt my feelings, but I can stand a little constructive criticism.
Tell me, what do you think are my main faults?
Let's start with this.
You analyse everything to death.
Sam said it wasn't your fault, but you keep digging around until you drive everybody nuts.
Dad thinks I am over-analytical.
That's great.
OK, who's next?
Niles?
I'm not sure how useful this exercise is.
- You're going to participate.
- Pushy.
Yes, if that's what it takes to Oh, thank you.
Daphne, it's your turn.
Don't be shy.
Well, if I had to choose, I'd say you are a bit of a fussbudget.
Ifyou don't mind this substitution, "demanding" is more le motjuste.
- Pretentious.
- Right.
Now see, this is very good.
Roz?
- You're a little full of yourself.
- Great.
OK.
Pompous.
And you do tend to ramble on with the callers.
- Tad loquacious.
- Pretentious.
- Dad, I already wrote that down.
- Underline it.
- Snippy.
- Sarcastic.
- Bossy.
- Huffy.
- Vain.
- That's a good one.
How nice.
We finally found an activity we can all enjoy together.
Why don't you admit what you're doing?
This isn't a "help me be a better person" thing.
You're trying to win Sam back.
- That's preposterous.
- Look who you're talking to.
I've been down this road so many times they call it the Roz Expressway.
I've heard that phrase before, but in a slightly different context.
Maybe there is some truth in what you say.
I mean, after all, Sam is really quite a catch.
Why wouldn't I want to get her back?
But you shouldn't change yourself just to please her.
It's not healthy, and it doesn't work.
If it did, Steve Wilson would be my husband and not just some name tattooed on my butt.
The best thing you can do is nothing.
Let her think about what she's missing.
I totally agree.
No candy.
No flowers.
And whatever you do, don't call.
Nothing wrong with keeping the lines of communication open.
- You called, didn't you?
- I left a carefully worded message.
You never call.
It makes you look desperate.
I didn't have any choice.
She wouldn't return any of my pages.
- I've blown it, haven't l?
- What did you say on your message?
Nothing undignified.
Of course, tone ofvoice is everything.
I should play them for you.
- You have her access code?
- Yes, I set it up with her.
I gave her an easy to remember code.
My birthday.
What's so easy about May 7th?
I wouldn't know, Dad.
My birthday's in March.
That's right.
The 7th.
That's Eddie's.
Here we go.
All right, now, listen and tell me ifyou think I sound desperate.
Hi, Sam.
Two quick things: dinner at L'Escalieris now at 8.30 and the judge needs to see you at nine tomorrow morning, not ten.
Bye.
- Not desperate, feminine.
- Shut up, Niles.
Hello, Sam.
It's Frasier.
Give me a call ifyou get a chance.
Bye.
You don't sound desperate at all.
Hi, Sam.
I'll be at the office.
Call me.
It's Frasier.
Maybe just a whiff of desperation.
Hi, I'm at the office now.
Still at the office.
I stepped out to the coffee machine.
Thought I might have missed you.
How quickly a whiff becomes a stench.
They just get worse after that.
- There's more?
- Yes, not any more, though.
- There.
Messages erased.
- Your messages weren't the only ones.
What about the one about the meeting with the judge?
- You're right.
- What are you going to do about it?
I could call saying I erased that message while erasing messages I left earlier.
- With her secret access code.
- Oh, God, this is humiliating.
I hate to appear unsupportive, but I've got to get to Duke's for the game.
- And we'll be late for that movie.
- Wait.
I forgot my purse.
Don't worry about it, Frasier.
You'll be fine.
You'll bounce back.
- You're tough.
- And resourceful.
- Resilient.
- Optimistic.
- Tenacious.
- Conceited.
Different list, Daph.
See you all.
Hard to believe this picture was taken only three days ago.
Look at us.
How happy I was.
Now I'll never see her again.
Aren't you over-dramatising?
You're bound to run into her.
No, I was talking about me and Lesley Stahl.
Looking at these photos, I can't help noticing there are very few ofyou and Sam together.
- What are you getting at?
- I'm just wondering how much - you really feel for this woman.
- I haven't felt this way in ages.
I'm sorry.
Guess I was wrong.
It's love then.
I don't know about love.
I mean, we've only been seeing each other for a month.
But you could fall in love with her.
Possibly.
- Sometime down the line.
- Yes.
Perhaps.
Well, no wonder you're heartbroken.
You've just lost the only woman you could even possibly, sometime down the line, perhaps fall in love with.
I'm surprised the country music people haven't jumped all over this one.
So I don't rhapsodise about her.
You did rhapsodise when she tookyou to Cigare Volant and you were seated in a secret VlP room we never knew existed.
Are you suggesting I'm so shallow I was with her for her connections?
Let's face it, you've always had a yearning to run with the cool kids, and it's never worked out for you.
Your one day on the football team.
The summer you bought a motorcycle.
Although It's only a moped ifyou pedal it, and I never pedalled.
I just wonder ifwhat you're mourning isn't so much the loss of Sam as the loss of her celebrity lifestyle.
I must admit things never did seem quite right between us.
If it hadn't been for her friends, l probably would've broken it off myself.
- Shame on me.
- Don't punish yourself, Frasier.
At least you're deep enough to realise you're shallow.
- Dinner?
- Let's.
Although I've still got to phone her about that message.
Why don't we stop by L'Escalier on our way?
You can tell her in person.
Even better.
Niles, I can't tell you how helpful this has been.
How can I ever repay you?
You can get me into that VlP room at Cigare Volant.
Where is the entrance?
Behind the cigarette machine?
No, that's just a decoy.
It's through the dry-cleaner next door.
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier.
- I know you didn't expect to see me.
- No.
Of course, after those messages, I can't say I'm surprised.
You heard them?
I checked my machine.
Frasier, we really need to talk.
No, we don't.
I promise you, I will never call you again.
I've thought about it and you made the right decision.
- No, I didn't.
- Excuse me?
Please, sit down.
I was going to call you later anyway.
You see, I think I figured out what happened between the two of us.
I panicked.
I was starting to really care about you, thought we might have a future even and, well, it scared me.
But the way you've pursued me, showing up at the courthouse, and leaving all of those messages.
Well, and now you're here.
Obviously you feel just as strongly as I do.
It's funny really.
Both of us falling in love and not realising the other felt the same way.
We should be laughing.
Listen, Sam No.
I'm going to tell you what we'll be doing this weekend.
We are taking the Concorde to London for a party at Alec Guinness' place.
Well, I'm not so sure Sir Alec Guinness?
I know it's a long way to go, but Stephen is going to be there and he'll play some songs from the new one.
I don't know if Stephen Sondheim?
- Guess who's singing with him.
- No, please, don't tell me.
Please.
Frasier, what is it?
You seem upset.
Sam, I can't see you anymore.
What?
You're an incredible woman, but I've come to a realisation about us.
Well, about me.
And I just don't see any future for us.
I know it sounds strange after the way I was pursuing you, but I've been in it for all the wrong reasons.
- Like what?
- I'm not very proud of this but maybe I was a little dazzled by the circle you travel in.
So you were with me just so you could be around some famous people?
- I was fond ofyou as well.
- Fond of me?
Thank you very much.
I understand you're upset and I'm going to go.
I don't believe this.
My friends.
Look, I know it's shallow and it's something I'm going to have to work on.
- Hi, Sam.
How are you?
- Lesley.
Hello.
It's Frasier Crane.
We met this weekend.
- How are you?
- What kind of sick bastard are you?
You're right.
We're having a bit of a spat, but of course I don't need to tell you being the ace reporter that you are.
Just get out of here right now.
- Maybe we could have lunch.
- Get out.
What's the matter with me?
Lesley
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
-Oh!
Easy.
-Sorry.
Yourneckistight.
-It'sbeenatensecoupleofdays.
-Holidays'll dothattoyou.
This has beentheworstChristmas ever.
Itall started yesterday.
The only part about Christmas I don't like is how quickly it's all over.
Yes.
Come December 26th, it's all just a memory, with nothing but your light decorating touch to remind us.
Afternoon, all.
That's awfully dangerous, Daphne, standing under that mistletoe.
That's enough eggnog, Niles.
The oddest thing just happened.
I was walking past that church on Chestnut, and Eddie assumed we were going inside.
He did the same thing with me yesterday.
- Any idea why he'd do that, Mr Crane?
- He's always doing weird things.
Yesterday we were taking our bath together and he spent 15 minutes pushing the soap around with his nose like an otter.
Weird.
Yes.
If he gets anyweirder, we'll have to send Eddie to a home.
I'm off.
I have all my Christmas shopping to do.
- All of it?
- I'm not going to settle this year.
I want my gifts to be remembered and cherished.
Nothing is cherished quite so much as the gift of laughter.
You'll have to buy that Highway Patrol bloopers tape yourself.
You can't drink that that way.
The first mistake in eggnog preparation is failing to garnish it properly with a dash of nutmeg.
There we are.
The second mistake is placing the paprika next to the nutmeg on the spice shelf.
- Mr Crane, are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine, Daphne.
I'm fine.
Frasier, before you go, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
What is it?
- What Daphne was talking about, there is a reason Eddie knows that church.
I've been taking him there.
I guess the family that bathes together prays together.
There's this priest, Father Curtis.
He got to know Eddie in the park and wanted to use him for the Christmas pageant.
Next thing I know, he's roped me in to play a shepherd.
Then Dutch gets bronchitis and I get promoted to a wise man.
Is there a point to this story looming somewhere on the horizon?
As a wise man, I have to sing a song but this song's a killer.
I'm going to humiliate myself.
- You just need a rehearsal.
- You think that'd help?
Sure.
You're a good singer.
We'll start around eight?
I am a good singer.
Remember those old family picnics when I used to belt out What's New, Pussycat?
We'll start around seven then.
Niles, hold the elevator.
Boys, this is that song I was telling you about.
O Holy Night.
- Do you know it?
- Of course.
It's a classic.
It all builds to that one glorious note.
Yes, that's the note I can't hit.
I practise it and Eddie ends up burying his head under the pillow.
We'll get you there.
I want it finished before Daphne gets back.
If she knows about this, she'll come to the pageant and I'm nervous enough as it is.
Let's just see what we have to work with.
Why don't you start here?
And I want to hear you really attack the note.
Sometimes the note sees the attack coming and retreats.
Shut up!
This bozo upstairs, he bangs on the floor every time I start to sing.
Ignore him.
There is another vocal exercise I remember.
It was useful to me when I was singing Colonel Fairfax in Yeoman ofthe Guard.
You distract yourselfwith a physical exercise, thus freeing the voice.
You hit one note, then you slide up the octave as you descend slowly into a crouched position.
Observe.
You see, it works.
That's very interesting.
I wonder if the reverse is true.
Try it, Dad.
No, I'm afraid with three of us doing it, it might look stupid.
Your problem may be psychological.
No, you're convinced you can't hit this note.
I convinced the guy upstairs, too.
Niles may be right.
You need reinforcement.
Try it again.
Try to eliminate any negative thoughts.
All right, let's go.
All right here, Niles.
"Fall on your knees", OK?
You've got it, Dad.
I hear sweet music.
Something's divine.
A star is born.
Bring it home now.
Shut up.
- Your shoulders are awfully tight.
- It's been a stressful few days.
- I'd be happy to listen.
- Oh, no.
Well, it started yesterday.
I had something on my mind.
Lucky for me, Dr Crane's brother was over.
He's always been such a good friend to me.
- Afternoon, all.
- Hello, Daphne.
That's awfully dangerous standing under that mistletoe.
- A piece could fall into your eye.
- Let me freshen your drink.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
The oddest thing just happened.
I was walking Eddie past that church on Chestnut and Eddie assumed we were going inside.
He did the same thing yesterday when I was walking him.
Any idea why he'd to do that, Mr Crane?
Nope.
Dogs are weird.
- That worries me a bit.
- What does?
I think your father's been going there.
I had an uncle who did the same thing.
He had no interest in church, then he started going every day.
He had some bad news from his doctor.
He didn't even last a year.
Well, first of all, I can see you're upset, so come here.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
You're always so supportive.
You're worrying over nothing.
If my father even had a hangnail, he'd let everyone know about it.
Maybe I've just got myselfworked up remembering my Uncle John.
Just saying his name gets you upset.
Come here.
You need a hug.
Mr Crane, are you all right?
We're fine, Daphne.
See?
Nothing to worry about.
Well, I have got to run.
Hold the elevator, Niles.
We'll see you soon, Daphne.
Dad?
Don't worry.
Niles and I will be there for you.
- What's that about?
- Oh, never mind.
I've got to go lie down.
Mr Crane, did you call Dr Stewart for the results ofyour physical?
Yeah, a couple of days ago.
I'm fine.
Come on, Eddie.
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
It's just all over so fast.
That convinced me I was right.
And the next 24 hours were a living hell.
The worst came the next day.
I'm terrified about this, Father.
All this came around so sudden.
I'm not prepared.
Tell me again what I'm supposed to say when I see Jesus the first time.
OK.
All right.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, I'll see you soon.
Bye.
Hi, Daphne.
Hello.
I'm so excited about the gift I just got for you.
- Great.
- Why don't you open it now?
To tell you the truth, I don't have much time.
I'm kind of on my way out.
Wait, OK, all right.
I'll open it now.
Sure, sure.
Don't want to get you upset.
You must be really excited about this.
Wow.
It's that sweater.
The one I pointed out to you in the window.
It's great.
I can die a happy man now.
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
Mr Crane, I know why you've been going down to that church.
You're not supposed to know about that.
But why is it making you so upset?
I care about you.
You were going to let this happen without telling a soul?
I don't want people staring at me in that church, stiff as a board, all that make-up on my face.
So how much time have you got?
About 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes?
- Yeah.
Will I be glad when it's over.
This is the last Christmas pageant I'm signing up for.
- You're in a Christmas pageant?
- Yeah.
What'd you think?
- I thought you were dying.
- What?
You just got your test results back, you're at the church all the time.
- Why are you laughing?
- That's funny.
- I don't think it's so bloody funny.
- Are you kidding?
- I'm dying.
- You will be.
- Daphne, don't do that.
- Don't you tell me what to do.
What kind of house were you brought up in anyway for God's sake?
You can talk about it ifyou like.
I'm not ready just yet.
I can't tell you how good that feels.
I don't think I've ever had a massage like this before.
Well, I'm glad.
As long as you're so relaxed, maybe I should give you your Christmas present right now.
Ow!
You woke me up.
Sorry.
I guess this ankle's a bit tender.
Yours would be, too, ifyou'd had the day I had.
I'd gone out to do some shopping.
Then I arrived at Frasier's building.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to crowd you.
This is a brand-new, hand-tailored ltalian suit.
It's difficult to get sap out of silk.
Another reason we didn't need this tree.
This thing's a fire hazard.
They make a chemical now that you can use to fireproof a tree.
It causes cancer.
Happy holidays, then.
- What just happened?
- I think the elevator stopped.
I'm sure we'll get it going in a moment.
We've probably got about 20 minutes of oxygen.
- Sir, you're going to alarm everyone.
- I work in an ER.
Perhaps you can instruct us on how to stay cool in a crisis.
I was on duty when the elevator cable snapped at the Bing building.
They brought those people in on cookie sheets.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Yeah, who is it?
We're stuck in one ofyour elevators.
The doors won't open and we're stuck.
- Where are you calling from, sir?
- Elliott Bay Towers.
It could be an hour and a half before anybody gets there.
My children are alone upstairs in the apartment.
Haven't got a gas oven up there, have you?
If somebody climbed through the trap door on top ofyour car, there's a manual release switch up there that would open up your doors.
- Somebody's got to go up there.
- That's a pretty small opening.
I have more confidence in your wife than you do.
I'll give you a leg up.
It has to be you.
- How do I get up there?
- Climb up the tree.
Oh, come on.
Surely you climbed trees when you were a boy.
That's Dr Crane's brother.
Fine.
I suppose in times of crisis, someone must be a hero.
Today that man is Niles Crane.
Tomorrow, it will be my dry-cleaner, Mr Li.
Grab his feet and we'll push him through.
Not so fast.
Not to worry.
I have landed in a nice soft puddle of grease.
I just have to find the release switch.
Bear with me.
- Quick.
- Did that do anything?
People?
Lady with my coat?
Where did you all go?
Oh, my God.
We're going up!
Someone stop this thing!
- Why is that man crawling?
- That's Dr Crane's brother.
I was shaken by what I had done.
But I had composed myself as I arrived at Frasier's.
It was some time later before I was able to say what had happened.
I have no idea what you use to get elevator grease out of silk.
Brown suede seems to be leeching it out nicely.
Anyway, no Christmas is complete without a bit of tumult.
But now we can all relax and enjoy a lovely holiday evening together.
Merry Christmas!
- You sure you want to hear about this?
- Why not?
OK.
I've been feeling depressed because I'm putting on all this weight.
I'm pregnant.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Roz.
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you.
It's brand-new.
And since you'll be ordering food, I will go rather than risk getting it stained.
Is that some kind of crack about how much I eat?
Absolutely not.
It's a crack about your table manners.
I should go.
I've got a couple of hours before the pageant.
- And I need the time to rehearse.
- Come tomorrow, it'll all be a memory.
But even after it's over, I still have to make peace with the man upstairs.
Are you sure we have to do this charity thing this afternoon?
Come on, Roz, it's just an hour out of your life.
You'll make an adorable Mrs Claus.
Why?
Because now I've gotten so fat?
Hello.
Why, yes, Mrs Doyle, yes, she is.
Just a moment.
They forwarded her from the office.
Hello, Mom?
Yes, I got your message.
Yep, I'm picking you up at the airport, 10am.
Looking forward to seeing you, too.
- Let me say Merry Christmas.
- Hang on, Mom.
Mrs Doyle.
Hi, happy holidays.
Just a word to the wise.
Roz has put on quite a few pregnancy pounds of late and she's really sensitive about it.
I would be careful what you say to her, all right?
Bye-bye.
We'll see you soon.
Bye.
I'll meet you over there.
I still have gifts to get.
I still have all of mine to get.
No matter how hard I try, I can't seem find anything that seems right this year.
It's really sweet how you're trying so hard to make all your gifts special.
I'm sorry I've been so cranky.
I'm just nervous about my mom coming.
I'm dreading the big conversation where I finally tell her I'm pregnant.
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.
It's just not the type ofthing you blurt out over the phone.
I'll let you get that.
I'll see you over there.
Hello?
Yes, I had a feeling you might call back.
I was beginning to worry about you.
I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown.
Shopping was a disaster.
When I went to slip into this darling costume, my pants split.
And I can't stop thinking about my mom.
How am I going to tell her?
- lfyou'd like, I can tell her for you.
- She'll be mad I waited three months.
It'd be worse hearing it from someone else.
- It's possible she already knows.
- No way.
The only person who knows she's spoken to is you.
Oh, my God.
Frasier.
OK.
Who's first?
I'm going to kill you.
- You're going to kill Santa?
- No, Mrs Claus just wants to kiss me.
Yeah, I'll kiss you.
Come here.
I'll kiss you good.
Here, run along.
Are you insane?
Roz, you tell your mother everything.
How was I supposed to know?
Hi, Santa.
I want a pony for Christmas.
You got it.
Now beat it.
- Can't we talk about this later?
- No.
Hi, Santa.
Oh, my God, what are you, 20?
Get out of here.
Try to stay calm.
No, I will not stay calm, because I am not calm.
I am completely freaked.
I am pregnant, and you told my crazy mother, and I'm too fat to even be Mrs Santa.
And I hate this holiday.
Mrs Claus was up very late last night.
I still had to stop by Frasier's.
I had to give him his champagne glasses.
Merry Christmas!
Roz, don't go.
I'm sorry about what happened, but it was a mistake.
- You can't stay mad at me.
- I have to face my mother tomorrow.
We can talk about that.
Come on in.
Please, come in.
How would it look if I turned a pregnant lady out on Christmas Eve when there's so much room here at the inn?
Niles, Daphne, Roz is here.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Come on, people.
Let's liven things up a little.
It's Christmas Eve.
What are the Cranes known for if not their legendary holiday spirit?
I hate singing, and I hate Christmas, and I'm going to bed.
Dad, what happened?
I went into my song and we come up to the high note and I think I'm going to hit it for once.
Then I see Eddie with his head buried in the Christ child's cradle.
He mistook the Christ child for a chewtoy and grabs hold of it and starts shaking it.
So, the Virgin Mary grabs hold of one of his legs.
Eddie loves a good tug ofwar, so they're going at it.
Then Eddie goes running outwith half of Bethlehem chasing after him.
I never should have agreed to do it.
- You'd have saved me grief.
- Don't start this again.
- Don't you talk to her like that.
- Let's not say something we'll regret.
- You're one to talk.
- Roz, I know it's hard to forget All right!
That is enough!
This is the night we celebrate peace and togetherness!
I will not have that ruined!
I intend to put us all in the right frame of mind by giving you all my gift.
I was determined to make my gift this year a little more meaningful, and after a great deal of effort, I believe I have.
My gift does not come from some fancy store, all wrapped in glittery paper.
My gift comes from my heart.
Tonight I intend to sit each one ofyou down and tell you in my own words exactly how much you mean to me.
That's it?
Are you out ofyour mind?
Or I could get someone over to give us all massages.
Great!
I'm so tense!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Ispecifically requested my macaroni and cheese al dente.
I know.
This lunch is a culinary Hindenberg.
Niles, our food may be payback for your recent editorial, Cafeteria of Shame.
They can't intimidate me.
They'll never silence my pen.
I could write an expos√© on their baked goods alone.
Yes, this is the hardest roll since Hamlet.
- Good one, Frasier.
May I use it?
- But of course.
These biscotti represent an all-time low.
Chalky aftertaste, inelegant aroma, spongy.
Spongy biscotti is an unwelcome trespasser into madeleine territory.
These pistachios are like swallowing gravel.
It's a wonder I've escaped injury.
Your ability to cheat death at every turn never ceases to amaze.
- Someone's in a mood.
- I'm sorry.
You know how you find yourself getting restless?
I have a feeling I'm about to.
Hello?
Yes.
Really?
Bravo.
Eccellente.
Benissimo.
- You'll never guess who that was.
- The Three Tenors?
No, that was my antique scout.
The present for Maris' birthday has arrived.
I got her the most exquisite antique saddle.
How does it look on you?
You won't laugh when you see it.
It is bejewelled, but not overdone, like Maris.
The craftsmanship is breathtaking.
It's been so expertly restored, - you can barely see the stitching.
- Again, like Maris.
Someone is in a mood today.
I'll get this.
Thank you.
You'd better go to the wine club on your own tonight.
What?
It'll just be the same old faces rehashing the same boring topics.
You are upset.
Let's get your mind off it.
Dinner?
Chamber music?
There's a wonderful lecture series on the history of modern lecture series.
I don't think so.
I feel like being on my own tonight.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.
- I'll see you at Cucina tomorrow.
- We'd better play that by ear.
- As you wish.
- Are you upset?
I'd have to have a fragile ego to be upset because you want time away from me.
Separate checks, please.
- Marty, we're getting hungry.
- It's coming.
Here we go.
Cold cuts, pizza rolls, devilled eggs, pork roll-ups.
Yes, the ideal buffet for a group of heavy-set men over 60.
I assume everyone's affairs are in order?
We're about ready to start our poker game.
- I'll be on my way in a minute.
- OK.
- We're about ready to start - I heard you, Dad.
I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself.
Lately my old routine doesn't seem to satisfy me anymore.
Maybe I could join you and the guys for some cards?
- I just don't think you'd fit in.
- Roz is playing.
Roz is one ofthe guys.
She knows more dirty jokes than Duke.
I could tell you a tale that'd make you blush like a schoolgirl.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Let him play.
It can't hurt anything.
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.
Let me get that for you.
Guys, Frasier's going to sit in with us tonight.
- You're going to play with us?
- Don't look so surprised.
Sometimes I enjoy a night with the guys.
OK, seven-card stud, high-low, - chips to win, the wheel is no good.
- Perfect.
- Three bump limit.
- Sounds good.
- You're lost, aren't you?
- Like a Bedouin in a sandstorm.
You guys get your all-weather tyres on yet?
I'm going to Richie's.
I'll let him do it.
- At Tim's you get free Armor All.
- You ever been to Hank's?
Yeah, I've been to Hank's.
Right next to Mike's Hardware.
At Mike's they got those cordless drills.
You ought to try Tommy's.
Free battery testers with every purchase.
I'm out.
Thanks for the money.
- That was a bust.
- Be glad you got out before the debate over who'd be more fun on a desert island, Angie Dickinson or Ursula Andress.
That is ludicrous.
It's Angie Dickinson.
Dr Crane, I know it's none of my business, but Never mind.
No, go ahead.
Perhaps you're restless because of a lack of female companionship.
- So I thought - Oh, dear.
I'm meeting my friend Clare for drinks tonight and she's feeling restless also.
Stop right there.
You know my policy on fix-ups.
She's pretty, lonely, and an underwear model.
You do know my policy.
Offwe go.
Say hello to the Fox and Whistle.
You point her out, and I will.
- Give us a kiss.
- I hope he's talking to you.
- Evening, all.
- Daphne!
- There's Clare now.
- She's everything you said she was.
- I'm engaged.
- And more.
- When did this happen?
- My old boyfriend Bob surprised me.
You've got to meet him.
He brought someone you might be interested in.
He is nice looking, isn't he?
Coming, Pookey.
It seems I've dragged you down here for nothing.
I would've missed seeing the world's most nauseating couple defend their title.
- We can leave ifyou like.
- No, you go talk with your friend.
- I'll have a drink.
- What do you need?
I've been asking myselfthat all day.
- Seems that lately my life - I'll come back.
I forgot that story.
It doesn't top the time Leo and I broke up that fight in the strip joint.
We walked in there and there was this one girl who Marty, maybe you shouldn't tell that particular story.
- Because of Roz?
- If I can handle the Angie-Ursula debate, I can handle this.
You agreed with me, right?
You said you'd rather sleep with Angie.
One more time, Leo.
If I had to choose.
You start telling them that strip-joint story.
You guys will bust a gut.
Anybody else need a beer?
Roz?
- Remember?
- I'm sorry.
I forgot.
Yeah.
Afraid you won't control yourself with all these handsome guys?
Too late for that, Frank.
I'm pregnant.
What, really?
That's great.
I remember when Annie was pregnant.
There is nothing more beautiful than a pregnant broad.
Best thing I ever did was having kids.
From the moment you hold that brand-new baby in your arms, - your life changes.
- You're right about that.
What about when they grab your finger?
That's the greatest feeling.
The joy of seeing them look up at you and smile.
- Cherish every moment, Roz.
- One minute they're on your lap.
Next thing they're out the door with lives of their own.
And it's just you, old and alone in an empty house.
So empty.
Leo, I don't think you told that story right.
- I think Steven likes you.
- I hope so.
He's adorable.
I was flattered he assumed I was an underwear model, too.
You didn't rush to correct him.
There'll be time for that after the wedding.
Maybe I should just tell Dr Crane to go home.
I'm surprised you broughtyour boss.
I could never relax around mine.
- What if he likes the place?
- That's nothing I have to worry about.
This pub really isn't his style.
Daphne, sing a song with us.
You're not shy singing around the house.
You live together?
- She's my dad's healthcare worker.
- You don't model underwear?
Only if her robe's not cinched up tight enough.
Come on, Frasier, we're going to do Knees Up, MotherBrown.
I don't know that.
I know.
Let's bring sheet music tomorrow night.
Tomorrow?
You can't.
I mean, do you know you have that gallery opening tomorrow?
No, but ifyou hum a few bars, I'll try to pick it up.
Sherry, Daphne's clearing out for a night.
Why don't you come over?
I'll get a fire going, open up a bottle of bubbly, put a little Bobby Darin on the stereo, and then "Look out, Macky's back in town".
I thought it up before I called you.
What's the difference?
OK, see you soon.
Don't you look beautiful.
Thank you.
It's so nice to have my pub back again.
At least for a night.
- You are sure Dr Crane has plans?
- He and Niles are going to the opera.
Let's hope it's a long German one.
I don't want him showing up for last call.
Good evening, Daphne.
You look smashing.
- I was just on my way out.
- To the Fox and Whistle?
I'll come.
Let me just get me brolly and Bob's your uncle.
I thought you were going to the opera.
That's tomorrow night.
I hope Winston's at the pub.
I owe him five quid.
- I'm not feeling so well.
- Hope it's not flu.
- I think I'll stay home.
- That's for the best.
Got to be careful what you bring down to the pub.
Tell me about it.
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.
- Is something the matter?
- Had a rough night last night.
How so?
I gave Maris her birthday saddle.
She was so thrilled she treated me to a little Lady Godiva impression.
Apparently the oils in the saddle reacted badly with her cellulite cream.
It created a powerful epoxy.
Oh, dear.
It took an hour and a full bottle of nail polish remover to get her free.
Today her thighs were so raw the only way she could find comfort was to straddle a frozen Butterball turkey.
The only thing that cheered me up was the thought of the opera tonight.
- That's tomorrow.
- No, it's tonight.
- I have the tickets right here.
- Oh, no.
Is there a problem?
Yes.
There's a billiard tournament at the pub tonight.
You're passing up Orpheus and Eurydiceto shoot pool at a sticky-floored saloon?
My partner Terrence is skipping a family wedding just to participate.
- Can't somebody take my place?
- I'd just as soon be by myself.
My brother has abandoned me.
My wife is cursing me.
When Orpheus descends into hell, I'll be waiting for him with a fruit basket.
You can't stay mad at me.
I'll make it up to you.
Press for the lift.
Don't look at me that way.
That's what they call it.
Ah, baby Why is it so bloody dark in here?
Bad enough I have to stay home, I'm not going blind as well.
You're staying in?
No choice since your son decided to go to my pub again.
Imagine being so dense that you can ruin someone else's evening and not even be aware of it.
This wax is dripping.
Have you tried maybe dropping a hint?
Believe me, I've dropped plenty.
They go right over his head.
I'll have a glass ofthat.
I've got to level with you.
Sherry's coming over and I'd hoped to have the place to myself.
You ought to talk to Frasier, and I'm not saying this to get you out of here.
- Tell him to go find his own place.
- I can't say that.
The longer you let it go, the more attached he's going to get.
- But he's my boss.
- But it's your pub.
OK.
That's it.
I'm going to go talk to him.
Good for you.
Hello?
No, Maris, sorry, you just missed him.
Why are your teeth chattering?
You're kidding me.
Can't you just use the defroster?
I never dreamed we'd be eliminated from the tournament in the first round.
Guess I was a little rustier than I thought.
- Maybe you can still make that wedding.
- It's in Liverpool.
Well, then, these are on me.
Hey, it's Daphne.
Hello, love.
Evening, all.
Dr Crane, I have to talk to you.
By all means, Daphne.
Winston, let's have one of these pints for Miss Moon, please.
This is a nice surprise.
You must be feeling better.
Here we are.
You make a toast.
I don't want you coming down here ever again.
I guess "Here's mud in your eye" sounded mean the first time, too.
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh but I don't know what else to do.
This is where I come to get away from things, including my job, - and you are my boss.
- Daphne, I am so sorry.
- I know that must sound selfish.
- No, not at all.
You know, back in Boston I had a bar like this one.
I certainly understand what it's like to have a place where you can get away.
So, we've just got one solution.
This is your bar.
I'll just go.
I do appreciate this, Dr Crane.
I know you've made friends here, too.
But you've got a history here.
They've become like family to me.
I'll just settle up and go.
Hey, stranger.
I've not been gone that long.
Two months is all.
- Who's this new girl?
- Daphne, Clare's friend.
- Been coming in the last month.
- A month?
Hello.
I'll see you at home, Dr Crane.
- You've only been coming here a month?
- That's longer than you.
There's no way I'm leaving now.
This bar has filled a void.
I won't throw that away because you beat me here by a fortnight.
Stop talking like us.
I don't know what you're arguing about but we settle things round here with a quick game of cricket.
- Darts?
- Yeah, rules are on the board.
- There's got to be a better way.
- Well, I don't know.
It's decisive.
It's better than bickering.
- It's not exactly my game.
- It's not mine either.
- All right, let's try it.
- You shoot first, Daphne.
I'm proud of us.
Two people with a conflict.
We found a civilised way to settle it.
Oh, my.
- Is that good?
- Quite good.
Lucky shot, then.
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to hustle me.
Not at all.
I may have played a game or two offeathers in my day.
A game or two?
You made the most difficult shot on the entire board.
Actually, that's only the second most difficult.
That's the most difficult.
Come to think of it, there might have been a dartboard in that bar in Boston.
Look at that.
It's all tied up.
Who would've guessed those hands were so skilled?
Certainly no one who's sampled your corned beef hash.
I score again.
That's not something we hear out ofyour mouth very often.
You don't want to rush this one.
- A lot riding on this.
- There's such a thing as sportsmanship.
Really?
This from a woman who made armpit noises during my last round.
Sod!
I am sorry, Daphne.
Now all I have to do is make this relatively simple shot, - unless you'd like to concede defeat.
- Typical American arrogance.
We Brits don't know the meaning of the word defeat.
Then you're not acquainted with a spat called the Revolutionary War.
Out of my way.
Just like a Yank.
Insulting us Brits to cover up your inferiority complex.
What should we feel inferior about?
Your pioneering work in the field of soccer hooliganism?
Say your worst.
There isn't as much dignity in this entire country - as our queen's got in her finger.
- You've bested me there.
What's more dignified than a dowdy sandbag with a flower pot on her head?
I win.
The bar is mine.
Lose the long faces, lads.
I'm staying.
I hope you didn't take those barbs about the motherland seriously.
- Perhaps you'd better leave now.
- There's no greater Anglophile than l. No, really, I have all my suits made at Savile Row.
I spell "colour" with a "u".
Hello, Niles.
Well, look who's here.
Take a wrong turn on the way to the pub?
Actually, that scene has grown tiresome and I miss this place.
I've spoken to Daphne.
I take it it's over "over there"?
You don't have to rub it in.
Anyway, I know I owe you an apology from the other night, so, here.
I brought you a peace offering.
Orpheus and Eurydice.
Thank you, Frasier.
The Glyndebourne production.
I don't have this one.
The Chorus ofthe Furies is particularly moving and Janet Baker is quite simply the best contralto solo I've ever heard.
Thank you, Frasier.
I don't have Orpheus and Eurydice on eight-track yet.
But I'm surprised to see you.
No woodworking club today?
To tell you the truth, I've grown tired of that crowd with their stupid bookends and birdhouses.
As soon as I shellac my shoetrees, I'm out of there.
- You got thrown out.
- I did not.
- I can see through you.
- Are you a psychiatrist?
No, but I can see it in your face.
You got kicked out.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they throw me out?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Igotyourmessageaboutthewineclub and I'll bethere.
Dad's kicking me outofthe house so he and Sherry can have a little party.
Life really is a circle, isn't it?
Dad's using my place for a party and just a fewyears ago, Dad would have to leave his house for my parties.
Ifyou'd had any parties, that would be filled with irony.
Thank goodness you're here.
I've got some shocking news.
What is it?
I found a ring in your father's underwear drawer.
What on earth would leave a ring around his underwear drawer?
Not around, in.
An engagement ring in a jewellery box.
Dad must be about to ask Sherry to marry him.
Do you know what that means?
We're going to hear what Mendelssohn's Wedding March sounds like on the banjo.
It means she'll be our mother.
What are we going to do?
There's nothing we can do, Niles.
It's what Dad wants.
What'll we call her?
I suppose she'll want us to call her Mother.
No, that's too formal.
No, Mama.
No, Ma.
Better still.
Don't you look nice, Ma.
Yes, I'd love another corn dog, Ma.
Off to the roller derby, Ma?
That's typical ofyou two.
Your father is about to get married, and all you can think about is how itwill affect you.
What about me?
- What about you?
- Sherry's never exactly liked me.
You don't think she'll try to make your father get rid of me, do you?
No, Daphne.
He'd be lost without you.
Yes, and even ifthat were to happen, I could always use you.
I mean that I would know of a position you could take that Services that you could perform I would know of an opening This is on me.
Marty, you need to stir the dip more.
It's got whole lumps of soup mix in it.
Sorry.
Quite the little shindig you two are planning fortonight.
You have the cheese logs.
Erotic fortune cookies.
For after dinner, a bloopers tape.
Too Hot forHee-Haw.
I see that Martha Stewart party book I gave you really paid off.
This crowd wouldn't go for froufrou stuff.
Get them liquored up, put out some corn nuts and they can go all night.
- When you say all night - Here you go, smooth as silk.
Who's attending this soir√©e?
Just some old friends I'm dying for Marty to meet.
Now let's see, there's Ray and Lola Sherwood.
I worked with them in Atlantic City when they had a knife-throwing act.
Marty, try not to stare at her eye.
She gets self-conscious.
And let's see.
Edie's coming with her new fianc√©.
- She finally met him, huh?
- Just this week.
They're engaged, and they met this weekend?
Well, up until now, it's been kind of a pen-pal relationship.
He's been detained the last few years.
You'll need some room for those corn nuts.
Why don't I just get this pesky priceless sculpture out ofyour way?
I never heard from Vic and Linda.
Did you get a message?
- No.
- Maybe they left one on my machine.
So what're you guys up to tonight?
Our wine club is having a vertical tasting ofthe Opus One.
Well, don't drink too much.
You don't drink the wine.
You just swish it around and spit it out.
We all did that at Duke's New Year's Eve party.
Course it wasn't wine, it was egg salad.
I just got a message from my manager down at McGinty's.
Some guy came in asking questions about me.
What kind of questions?
Where I used to work, the people I used to date, and my neighbour said somebody asked her about me, too.
- Somebody's checking up on you.
- Like a detective?
It's probably a credit card company.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It is a little scary.
I wish I knew who it was.
Forget it, honey.
I've been through this before.
Private investigators never leave a trail.
- It could be anyone.
- If you say so.
- Which one ofyou hired him?
- That is just crazy.
Who else would have the money to do that?
We had nothing to do with it.
Do you think we'd hire someone to spy on Sherry?
- I'm insulted.
- As am l. - I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
- You certainly have.
- I'm sorry, boys.
- It's all right, Dad.
Just forget about it.
You hired a detective?
How could you?
I have never been so insulted.
OK, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for Dad here.
What do we really know about this woman?
She makes Dad happy.
That's all we need to know.
Some people get married before they know all they should.
Remember cousin Donald?
He was married two years before he found out his wife used to be a man.
Cousin Donald is a rare case.
Most people don't have a hidden past.
And most people have a better eye for details than Donald.
The woman could pick up a watermelon with one hand.
I was just simply trying to get some background information.
Well, stop it.
- Call it off right now, Niles.
- Consider it done.
- We've got to run.
- Yeah.
Goodbye.
Have a nice time, you two.
We'll save you some cake.
Thank you.
You see that, how sweet she is?
I can't believe you're having her investigated.
Try trusting people.
- Quick, is someone following me?
- Yes, here comes Lady Law now.
Excuse me, ma'am, I saw you cross against the light.
I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
I'm really sorry about that.
It's just that it's so cold out there, and the pollution, and I didn't want to expose my unborn child to the elements any longer than I needed to.
You're pregnant.
I know a little bit about that myself.
Then you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Society doesn't go easy on pregnant ladies, does it?
So when are you due?
I'm not pregnant.
That's Roz Doyle.
Do you want to step over here, please?
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
May I borrow your pen?
Certainly.
How do you do?
I appreciate all your hard work and I am sorry to have to break off the investigation in the middle.
People change their minds all the time.
I'm sure they do.
There you are.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
- There, now don't you feel better?
- I suppose so.
You have to admit I was right on this one.
You had no justification for giving in to your baser instincts and prying into Sherry's past.
I almost forgot.
I wrote up a little report on what I found out so far.
That's one interesting lady.
I should've told him to drop it in the trash.
We're concerned with Dad's happiness.
Sometimes you are like a beacon, piercing the fog of my baser instincts.
- Miss, would you drop that in the - Give me that.
You've proven your point.
I hate myself for what I'm doing.
We're doing it for Dad's own good.
So far, so good.
Graduated from high school.
Almost paid off her Subaru.
- Did you know she'd been married?
- Yes, she mentioned that.
To Johnny Dempsey.
There were two others/ Ned Foley, Marc Wallace.
That's a bit troubling.
Three previous marriages?
Vincent Mayhew.
Milton Mandell.
- Walt - Just give me the total.
Six.
That we know of.
You had to go and fire that detective before he finished his report.
Six husbands.
She's obviously incapable of remaining in a relationship.
Doesn't bode well for the marriage.
On the upside, it does bode well for Dad getting a "yes" when he proposes.
He has a right to know about this.
We told him we weren't involved in the investigation.
Maybe we can impart the information without explaining how we came by it.
- Drop it in the conversation.
- And how would that go?
"Dad, going to the Sherry Ex-Husband Convention this year"?
Besides, Dad may know already.
I think we need to find that out.
What if Dad marries her and in a year he's tossed aside like Danny Mitchell?
- Who's that?
- Page five.
Engaged, but never married.
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.
What do you think about this jacket?
Something doesn't quite feel right.
- I think it's nice.
- Really?
Dad, I was talking with a lady today.
I happened to mention that I had been married twice before.
A look clouded over her face as if I had confessed to some unspeakable sin.
And people who've been married more than that.
Quite a taboo they face.
I don't know.
It's so I think it all harkens back to the puritanical streak that still runs through this country.
What do you think?
There's a yakety-yak streak that runs through this family.
Maybe it's the shirt.
You like this shirt?
Yes, it's nice.
Might make a good topic to discuss on my show.
The hurdles that are faced by people with multiple marriages.
Hard to round up enough people who've been married a lot of times.
- Do you know anyone?
- No, I don't.
Mrs Kranz upstairs - How about you, Dad?
- Sure, I know some people.
Really, you do?
- I think.
- You think?
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
I hate this shirt.
I've got to change this shirt.
- That was fruitless.
- I'll tell you one thing I'm sure of.
Yes?
Oh, I'm allowed to talk now, am l?
I've never seen your father so nervous.
He's meeting Sherry and I bet he'll pop the question.
- We have to tell him.
- But we don't know what he knows.
If she'd told him she'd been married six times, - he would remember.
- Who, Sherry?
Maybe this shirt isn't so bad with this new jacket.
- What do you think ofthis jacket?
- It's nice.
Sherry's been married six times?
- Who told you that?
- They did.
What's this all about?
I'd love to see the first shirt with the second jacket.
You got this from the investigator.
You did hire him.
I guess there's no use in denying it.
Yes, we did hire him.
Although the word "we" is not entirely accurate.
- Frasier, I am shocked that - Shut up, Niles.
Dad, we were just concerned about you.
We know about the engagement ring.
- Who went through my drawers?
- Pointing fingers won't help.
- What's the matter with you?
- She did it.
It's nice to know there isn't a single person in this house I can trust.
Sherry told me about her marriages.
I didn't tell you because it's none ofyour damn business, just like it's none ofyour business who I marry or who I don't marry.
I don't know why I'm even wasting my time talking to you.
See what I get for confiding in you two blabbermouths.
Next time I find something in your father's underwear drawer, I'm just going to sit on it.
This evening is an entire disaster.
I'm already late for dinner with Maris.
I don't know how this could've happened.
Who'd have guessed that something so innocent as spying on a man's girlfriend and rifling his underwear drawer could turn so ugly?
There is one consolation.
We told Dad the truth and could bear his anger.
That's the nice thing about our relationship.
We're all adults.
We're not afraid of confrontation.
Stop stalling, Niles.
Dad must be in the elevator by now.
Look what I found in your father's jacket.
- I do not want to know.
- He forgot the ring.
This will be embarrassing for him.
- I suppose I could take it down to him.
- No, Daphne, I should do that.
It'll give me an excellent opportunity to show him how happy I am - that he's marrying Sherry.
- That would be nice.
I can't figure out why he would propose in McGinty's.
It's so shabby.
Well, I guess maybe he was just trying to match the ring.
So I told herthatyou and l would take a trip up there this spring.
- Well, you like my sister, right?
- Yeah, sure.
You can't hold one embarrassing moment against her.
She didn't know you were in there.
No, I don't.
No, I like your sister.
Well, then what is wrong with you?
You're being so quiet.
- I got something on my mind.
- Well, what is it?
I've been thinking a lot about us, and Where do you see us going?
I don't know.
I mean, I'm having fun the way things are.
You have your life, I have mine.
No pressure.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Is there something wrong with having fun?
No.
We've been just having fun for a long time now.
Let me ask you something.
Where do you see us in a year?
Five years?
I don't know.
I try not to look too far ahead.
That's the difference between us.
Because I can't stop thinking that far ahead.
I've come to realise, Sherry, that I want to get married again.
And, you know, that's not anything that you're interested in.
Well, can you blame me?
I mean, Marty, you know my track record.
I've been down that road a lot of times.
I've learned the hard way.
I'm not looking for forever.
Well I am.
So you're breaking up with me?
We're just looking for different things, Sherry.
I'm sorry.
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah.
Dad, fancy seeing you here.
Can I speak with you for a second?
Will you get out of here?
I've got something you might want before you tell Sherry He's already told me.
He has?
Well, that is just wonderful.
And may I say, it's about time.
- I couldn't be happier for you.
- That's nice to know.
Dad, I'd like you to know that everybody is 100% behind this decision.
I'm so glad thatyou're so happy yourfather is breaking up with me.
Breaking up?
I had no idea.
And you get paid to help people through their difficult moments in life?
It isn't easy saying goodbye, is it?
No.
It doesn't get any easier either.
I should know.
Listen, Marty, this is usually the time people say, "Well, let's be friends".
And then there's a phone call or two, but they never see each other again.
Well, I just want you to know that I am around for you ifyou ever get lonely or you just need to talk.
Thanks.
And when you call, if a man answers, hang up.
Hi, Dad.
Obviously I came down here to bring you this.
Obviously I made another colossal blunder in a week full ofthem.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
I guess you don't really feel like talking, huh?
You know, Frasier, sometimes I just feel like sitting and watching a game.
Fine.
I can do that.
Yeah.
Sure.
Well, so the Sonics and Bulls.
That Jordan, he's really something, huh?
Yeah.
The way he scores those points and gets the ball back when the other team misses.
That's incredible.
He made the same impossible shot twice in a row.
It's the instant replay.
You know, I was carrying this thing around for a month.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But at the end of every night, I just couldn't pop the question.
And then I realised it was because I knew what the answer would be.
She didn't want to get married again.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- It's all right.
Maybe it wouldn't have worked out between us anyway.
Your mom's a hard act to follow.
I never went through anything like this with her.
We knew we were meant to be together.
And that was that.
It's hard to find that out there.
I've been trying for a while.
You'll get there.
Hope we both do.
You know, Dad, in time That was quite a shot.
Yeah, Payton's been pretty hot lately.
- What's the score?
- Sonics are down by five.
Got a chance if they can hold Jordan.
- Can I get a beer here, please?
- Yeah, make that two.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Well, lookwho's here.
It's KACL's Frasier Crane.
And Rosemary's Bebe.
Quite a shake-up going on down at the station.
The new owner's renegotiating everyone's contract.
Before you drop another hint, my feelings about you haven't changed.
I'm here to meet one of my newer clients, a rising star of the Seattle airwaves.
What pathetic dupe have you lured into your web?
Roz.
- Oh, dear God.
- You get offyour feet, little mother.
I'll fetch you a nice nourishing muffin.
- You signed to Bebe?
- OK, I should have told you.
I wasn't in the mood for a lecture.
You're entitled to choose whoever you wish.
Someone who's honest or whose ethics would've raised eyebrows in the court of Caligula.
She's got me three voice-over jobs.
She may be shifty but she helps me put food on the table.
- One muffin.
- See?
I had a brainstorm about how to turn this bundle of joy into cash.
Use my baby to make money?
It's high time the little slacker started pulling his weight.
Dr Clint Webber's medical show.
I see a daily segment called A Pregnant Pause: Roz Doyle's Term ofEndearment.
All of Seattle will share in the miracle happening inside you.
Your joys, hopes, morning sickness, sonograms, even the birth.
- I'll give birth on the air?
- It's radio.
Just make the noises.
Hell, I'll make them myself.
- Need anything else here?
- Just a shower, thank you.
You know, Mr lntegrity, you still haven't hired anyone to negotiate this big deal for you.
Could it be because you know you want to come back to me?
I'm determined to make the right choice.
- You'll need somebody good.
- I intend to find someone good.
It's possible to find an agent who can drive a hard bargain and maintain high ethical standards.
Happy hunting.
Ifthings don't work out, you know my number.
Still 666, is it?
Dad, we had a mix-up last night with our bags at the video store.
- Believe me, I noticed.
- There you go.
I was dismayed to see Charles Bronson blowing away street trash.
But it was quite suspenseful.
That's the way Duke and I felt about My Dinnerwith Andre.
Talk about suspense.
Will they order dessert?
Will they leave a good tip?
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, sorry to trouble you but could you recommend another couples therapist?
What happened to Dr Prescott?
Maris had me can Dr Prescott weeks ago.
Now she wants me to fire Dr Wilfong.
- What's wrong with him?
- His criticism of her is too harsh.
Some therapists can be rather blunt.
What did he say?
He asked her to refrain from catalogue shopping during our sessions.
Ifyou fire every therapist that finds fault with her, you won't make progress.
You're right.
I'll tell her, we're not going to change.
- That's that.
- Good.
There's nothing more rewarding than sticking to a principle.
Case in point, Bebe Glazer's been angling to negotiate my new contract.
I could have said yes, taken the money and run.
But, instead, I said no and I found myself a new agent, one who's every bit as smart and also ethical.
That's him now.
I don't know what he said but there's no such thing as an ethical agent.
One's just as slimy as the other.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I was making my last Meals on Wheels delivery and I swerved to avoid a pigeon.
Then splat went the food all over the stuffed bears for the toy drive.
I had to throw the bears in the wash and cook some more borscht for Mrs Popov.
This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane.
Ben.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm sorry I'm running out.
You're a refreshing change from Frasier's last agent.
She would've swerved to hit the pigeon.
She would've swerved to hit Mrs Popov.
Ben, meet my dad, Martin, and this is his home healthcare worker, Daphne.
- This is Ben, my new agent.
- Very nice to meet you.
You're a pretty busy volunteer.
Ben just won this year's Seattle Samaritan Award.
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.
May l?
Before we start this negotiation, it wouldn't hurt to raise your public profile.
OK, here's my plan.
For a year I've worked for the Mercer lsland Zoo.
- Creating awareness.
- There's a zoo on Mercer lsland?
You bet.
This will be great PR for both ofyou.
They just bought a rare crane.
I convinced them to name it after you.
You know, Frasier Crane.
There'll be a ceremony with full newspaper and TV coverage.
It's brilliant.
It bolsters my bargaining position and helps out a zoo.
I love this man.
It would be fun to have a crane named after me.
I just love those big pouchy mouths they scoop up the fish in.
- I think those are pelicans.
- Oh, right.
Cranes are the ones who always sound like they're laughing.
No, wait, I'm thinking of loons.
That's a coincidence.
Shoot, I got borscht on my sleeve.
- Do you have any club soda?
- Right through here.
Frasier, are you sure you want to send in that Mouseketeer?
Why do you assume that to be an agent you have to be an unscrupulous huckster?
It is possible for a decent man to be as intimidating as the toughest shark out there.
Time to skedaddle.
I have to pick up a friend.
The poor guy just went bankrupt, so he's bunking in our rumpus room.
That's generous ofyou.
Well, he's not just a friend.
He's a client.
The press and the board members will join us in here for a buffet.
So I finish my speech and then give Mr Twembly the cue, and he brings out this marvellous creature.
Just give me the signal.
This is great.
Look at this.
Turkey, chicken wings.
Got to make you a little nervous, huh?
Look, it's Toffee Macintosh from the news.
I just love her.
- Frasier.
- Toffee, thank you for covering us.
You know my motto.
"lf it happens in Seattle, it's news to me".
I'd like you to meet one of your biggest fans, Daphne Moon.
I love the way you get all sombre when you describe a flood or a murder.
Then you cheer right up the minute you're done.
It makes me think, "lf she can get over it, so can l".
That's what I'm here for.
- Ready to greet your public?
- Come on, Dad.
I'll be there in a sec.
See what maternal instincts this woman has.
Even Bobo here can sense it.
I'm not the only one getting some publicity today.
- Frasier, they want to start.
- Ben, I'd like you to meet some people.
This is Bebe and Roz.
This is Ben, my new agent.
- Hi.
- Hi, Ben.
Small world.
Mr Twembly and I sang for the same choir in Salt Lake City.
Nice meeting you, ladies.
Well, when there's a dirty job to be done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon.
Scoff all you like.
The man is a genius of PR.
Good afternoon.
On behalf ofthe Mercer lsland Zoo, I would like to welcome our very special guest, Dr Frasier Crane.
Thank you, Mr Twembly.
It's appropriate that the zoo has called upon me to introduce you all to its newest resident.
You see, he happens to be a relative of mine.
What're you looking at?
This is human food.
You don't see me looking at your bird food, do you?
What are you doing?
That's notvery nice.
Wait.
No.
Where are you going?
We're both tall and have distinctive profiles.
We've both been known to winter in Mexico.
And let's not forget our voices.
Is there anything as stirring as the crane's majestic cry?
- Get it off me!
- Dad, are you all right?
My goodness, what is going on?
I'm sorry.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Just a little family squabble.
In a shocking and gruesome incident, the Mercer Island Zoo seemed more like the Island of Doctor Moreau, as a disabled senior citizen was savagely attacked by Frasier Crane, bird of prey.
- I can't watch this.
- I can't hear any of it.
You weren't hurt badly.
You wouldn't know that to listen to Toffee.
- She makes it sound like a disaster.
- But she could smile right after.
This affair has turned into a PR nightmare.
It's your own fault for hiring Howdy Doody as your agent.
Ben had no idea that bird was going to attack you.
Besides, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
The radio are offering a cash prize for the best Frasier Crane joke.
What was the front-runner?
How can you tell Frasier the crane's a psychiatrist?
I can't wait to hear.
He ignores what you say, then sticks you with a large bill.
Forgive my jolly mood but Maris was over for our weekly conjugal visit.
She looked so seductive.
She wore a clingy gown, crimson lipstick, even earrings, which she tends to avoid as they make her head droop.
She pulled me down upon the bed and began playing my spine like a zither.
Then as things were heating up, she requested again I dismiss DrWilfong.
So tremulous with desire was l that I almost relented, but then I remembered your advice, Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire him.
So Maris told me I wouldn't be firing anything else in the foreseeable future.
And she left.
Withholding sex can be just as difficult on Maris.
Are you serious?
One hour of passion can sustain her for months.
She stores it up like some sexual camel.
All right, Niles, you know that my advice was solid.
I hope you're right.
I'll get it.
- Hello.
Hello, Roz.
It's Roz.
- Thank you.
Roz, hello.
Yes, what is it?
- That's a striking arrangement.
- It's from Bebe.
She's trying to woo him back.
Birds of paradise.
I suppose that's her idea of floral irony.
Thanks for the warning, Roz.
- Bye-bye.
- What's that about?
The station manager won't be renegotiating the contracts himself.
Apparently he's brought in one of these hired guns stations use to reduce costs.
- Some fellow nicknamed "The Hammer".
- "The Hammer" because he's tough?
No, Niles, because he loves the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein.
If I were you, I'd give Bebe a call.
This is a pretty big negotiation.
No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben.
Maybe Bebe could use her dark arts to get me a dollar ortwo more, but my integrity is worth more than that.
- Hey, big guy.
How are you doing?
- I'm fine.
People are being mean about this.
I was listening to the radio on the way over.
Ouch.
I always say, "lf life hands you a lemon, make lemonade".
- So you've got a damage control plan?
- I got a way to turn this mess around and show that station manager what you're made of.
Excellent.
But you'll be dealing with a freelancer they call the Hammer.
- You've gone up against him?
- I had to take a firm line with him.
I finally said, "You just clean up your language, pal".
"l walked out of that Mamet play, I can walk out on you".
- So, about your plan.
- I think there's a way to show people you're laughing with them.
You do a photo op where you, Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist, give the crane therapy.
You sit in a chair with a pad on your lap, and the crane, properly sedated, sits on this.
- Where did you find a couch that size?
- I built it myself.
I have a workshop in my attic where l make toys for the neighbourhood kids.
Look at you.
Agent, Samaritan, elf.
Dad, I like this idea.
It's droll and self-mocking.
It's a way to turn a PR embarrassment into a triumph.
Great.
I'll set up the photo op.
Don't be nervous about the Hammer.
I can be a tough customer myself.
I know you're going to give him hell.
I love show folk, but I'll never get used to the cursing.
Latte, please.
Didn't I see your picture in the paper today?
There was a big bird chasing you around a little couch.
Latte, please.
I thinkyou have a real case against the maker ofthose crane sedatives.
I just wish they'd named the damned bird after somebody else.
Gregory Peck, perhaps.
Thank you for the sympathy.
You're not the only one having a rough patch.
My libido is at breaking point.
- You can't give in.
- I am getting desperate.
This morning I flirted with my manicurist.
- The one with the thing on her face?
- I told you, I'm desperate.
What can be keeping Ben?
After all this, you're still using Ben?
Shouldn'tyou just go back to Bebe?
You think if I bail on my principles, it gives you an excuse to go back to Maris.
Well, I won't do it.
Ben may have made some mistakes, but he is a good man.
He's going to make me a good deal.
Gil.
How did it go with the Hammer?
You've never seen such cold, dead eyes.
It was like bargaining with Nosferatu.
- My salary's been slashed.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else for you?
- Would you nibble this provocatively?
Niles!
We're fine, thank you.
I wish you good luck, Frasier.
Nobody can squeeze blood from that stone.
Lattes for everyone.
Don't tell me you did well?
I got a weekly spot on Clint Webber's show and a 30% raise.
- How did you get all that?
- We go way back, the Hammer and l. I know where the bodies are buried.
Usually that's just a metaphor.
So, Gil, what'll you have?
My treat.
I'll be happier at the losers' table with Aunt Penny, the Story Lady.
Penny, don't put that flask away.
Well, congratulations, Roz.
I'm waiting for Ben.
We have to discuss our bargaining position.
There are so many to choose from/ kneeling, crawling, grovelling.
I'm sure he'll pick the right one.
God, she is obnoxious.
Though alluring, in a buxom-bad-girl kind ofway.
Shut up, you horny idiot.
My bandage is loose.
If Ben gets here, just tell him I went in to fix it.
We have to talk.
Are you aware you are in the men's room?
If I paid attention to signs with pictures on them, I'd never get a parking space.
It's time we dropped the masks.
You need me and I want you back.
Sign this contract.
I'll cut you a deal to make Roz's look like lunch money.
Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere you should be hovering over?
You want to see a carcass?
Go look in the mirror.
Look what you've let that man do to you.
Your face is riddled with bird bites, your name's a punchline and your career is five minutes from over.
And he's only been your agent for three days.
Send him in against the Hammer and you'll be doing fog reports from a lighthouse in Puget Sound.
- Admit it, you're scared.
- All right, maybe I am scared.
But there's one thing that's stronger than fear.
Faith.
Faith that a good man with a good heart can make a good deal.
- Now get out of my way.
- No, I won't let you.
You know what I've been through building your career?
I have been to hell and back so often I have frequent flyer miles.
You owe me a second chance.
Take your tentacles off of me.
Please.
I won't be the same Bebe you knew.
I'll change.
I'll be like Ben only competent.
Darling, you forgot to sign.
You've reconciled.
I'll be off to Maris's.
Sit down, Niles.
I'm still with Ben.
I took my son's troop on a nature hike and Noah got a bee sting.
I rushed him to the ER and came straight here.
- We've got five minutes.
- Excuse me.
Bebe can make you a better deal.
- Listen to Roz.
- Listen to Niles.
I won't listen to any of you.
Am I the last man still willing to stand up for a principle?
Shall we go over those demands for old Mr Hammer?
Ben, could we have a word?
Hello, Maris?
I don't think it's news to you that things haven't been going so smoothly.
I think I'd feel more comfortable with Bebe.
This must seem a bit of a shock to you, but Heck, no.
I saw this coming.
When you threw that couch at me, I thought to myself, "This is not a happy client".
Thanks for understanding.
Taxi!
Sign right here, darling.
I'm holding you to that promise about changing.
- I won't stand for any shady doings.
- Those days are all behind me.
Maybe you can see what you can do about diffusing this bird situation.
You don't have to worry about the crane.
It choked to death this morning.
They have no idea who would feed a bird a jawbreaker.
Bye now.
Bebe, is there any chance it wasn't you?
Darling, there's always a chance.
I can live with that.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
-Morning, Roz.
- Niles called.
He'll be over at seven.
- Thanks.
You seem awfully calm today.
- Why shouldn't I be?
You're usually anxious in ratings week.
- That starts today?
- I shouldn't have mentioned it.
You do this every year.
You convince yourselfwe'll have no good callers, but our listeners always come through.
You're on.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I was reminded this morning of a jaunty aphorism that's credited to the great thinker Spinoza.
Oh, God!
- What's your problem?
- Hi.
Well, I'm kind ofindecisive.
Well, I'm not.
Frasier Crane Show.
I want to change careers.
I feel trapped.
It's not a great problem, but hold, please.
Frasier Crane Show.
what's your problem?
- It's sort of embarrassing.
- Amen.
I was a bed-wetter as a child and I think the problem's coming back.
Great.
Hold, please.
Career change?
I got a bed-wetter holding.
Are you trapped because you're a woman trapped inside a man's body?
- I don't think so.
- I can't get you on then.
I really wanted to talk to him.
I guess that could be part ofit.
Good answer.
Hold, please.
Bed-wetter, I got a transsexual in crisis.
You've got to beat that.
Ever wet a bed with anybody else in it?
A hooker, best friend's wife?
No.
- Do you want to talk to the doc or not?
- OK.
I guess the third one.
Hold, please.
Hey, transsexual.
- Is that me?
- Yeah.
Have you ever run for political office or considered it?
- Like congressman?
- Perfect.
Don't get me started on rationalistic pantheism or there go the three hours.
I think it's time we went to the phones.
Roz, whom do we have?
A bed-wetting adulterer, unless you'd rather speak to Roger on line two who's a transsexual running for Congress.
Go ahead, Roger, I'm listening.
Why did you chicken out like that?
She's younger than I am.
She probably dates doctors and lawyers.
- She wouldn't be interested in me.
- Who wouldn't be interested?
A certain someone had the chance to ask a certain someone else - from the building on a date.
- That would be Mrs Crowley.
And bailed out again.
The Crane men have not enjoyed success in the romance department lately.
We're all a bit gun-shy.
Gun-shy, sensitive, picky.
You're all full of excuses.
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get you married off and out ofthis house.
Hello?
Why, Mrs Crowley, we were just talking about you.
Yes, he's here.
Hold on.
Hi.
Really?
No, I'm not busy.
Dinner sounds like fun.
A certain someone is inviting a certain someone else to dinner.
Yes, and where would the world be without you Brits and your knack for code-cracking?
Sure, I'd love to.
Thanks.
And thanks for asking me.
Bye.
She's invited me to her place tomorrow night.
Guess my little hard-to-get plan really paid off.
Yes, you should write a book.
"How to Get a Date in Two Easy Years".
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.
Dad.
Hey, Daphne.
- What have got there?
- Patient files.
Frasier's helping me with my couples' group.
Your father's starting a couples' group tomorrow.
Mrs Crowley?
It's ironic.
Dad's doing better in that department than either of of us.
Not true.
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Maris and l are back on the expressway to love.
Well, if not the expressway, at least the on-ramp.
I owe it all to the best psychiatrist I have ever known.
- That's very flattering.
- Dr Bernard Schenkman, our new marriage counsellor.
He's a wizard.
Maris is thrilled with him.
It's as if he's discovered the magic elixir to repair the shattered fragments of her psyche.
- I don't know what to call it.
- The words "crazy glue" leap to mind.
Doctor Schenkman's helped me, too.
He pinpointed my primary failing.
- Which is?
- I'm too predictable.
I don't know if I'd count that as a failing.
I do and so does Maris.
But I'm going to do something about it.
In half an hour I'll show Maris spontaneity beyond her dreams.
But we're preparing for your workshop.
You'll have to look over the files yourself.
Every Friday Maris spends an hour meditating.
Invariably she comes back randy as a stoat.
Tonight she'll find me waiting in her bed as randy as another stoat.
I wonder ifthat's a good idea.
Frasier, I know you mean well and I love you and respect you, but with your track record in relationships, you're about the last person who should be giving advice.
Fair enough.
And do look over the files.
Those couples really need our help.
Hello, Maris.
Maris?
- Dr Schenkman.
- Niles.
Dr Schenkman, what the hell's going on?
It's not what it looks like.
What am I saying?
Bear with me.
- I'm sorry.
I'm feeling stressed.
- You're feeling stressed?
- Put yourself in my place.
- I very nearly did.
I'm stunned.
How long has this been going on?
Two weeks.
Maris and I were waiting to tell you when I felt that you were ready.
That's despicable.
It's unethical.
It's Are those my pyjamas?
Could be.
They bind a little in the crotch.
Listen, whatever anger you're feeling - can't begin to approach my guilt.
- Don't bet on it.
That's good.
Vent that rage.
You have every right to.
You're sleeping with my wife and giving me permission to be angry?
Furious.
Livid.
You're dealing with itverywell, bythe way.
- Would you care?
- You could lose your licence - for having an affair with a patient?
- And I deserve to, but it was a risk worth taking because of love.
I love her, Niles.
I've never known a woman so warm, so nurturing, so unselfish.
Is it possible this is a case of mistaken identity?
Thanks to our sessions, Maris has been unafraid to show me the real woman inside.
Damn you.
I trusted you.
Because you were supposed to be helping us.
And I liked you, too, you bastard.
You betrayed my confidence and my friendship and you seduced my wife.
There's a lot of new issues here, aren't there?
Think maybe we should kick it up to three sessions a week?
- You are 20 minutes late.
- Sorry.
Sorry?
I've been making small talk with them for 20 minutes.
And for people who have a problem communicating that's tiny talk.
I have a lot on my mind right now so let's just begin and, you know what, maybe you should take the lead.
OK?
Very well.
Evening, all.
Sorry I'm late.
My fault.
If I know these people, they won't hold a grudge.
I feel as though I do know a great deal about this group.
I've spent a good deal oftime pouring over your case histories.
So, let's begin.
Mrs Buddinger, I see that you're here alone.
- Yes.
- Is there a reason Dan's not here?
No, he's just stubborn sometimes.
He says he doesn't trust psychiatrists.
- Maybe he's got good reason not to.
- Excuse me?
I see what your brother's doing here.
Sometimes we role play and I think he's just saying what my husband might say.
Sounds promising, Janice.
Howwould you respond to whatyour husband has just said?
You know, Dan, I don't think that it's psychiatrists thatyou mistrust.
I think it's me.
Why are you so suspicious lately?
I thinkyou knowverywell.
A couple of harmless flirtations at parties?
Did you ever stop to consider how those flirtations might make me feel?
He's empathising with the husband.
We call this empathising.
Are you going to tell me you've never looked at anyone else?
Don't you dare bring her into this.
She is clean and pure and decent.
Sometimes empathising involves a bit of dramatic licence.
- At least I've always been faithful.
- I've always been faithful to you.
I wanted to believe that more than anything in the world but now I don't see how I possibly can.
He's one of the greatest empathisers in the business.
Now I just want to die!
Perhaps now would be a good time to take our 15-minute break.
We've made quite a catharsis here.
Traditionally it is the patients who make the breakthroughs, but we mustn't be sticklers.
All right, Janice.
Dan and I have never cheated on each other.
You've got to believe me.
I do.
Remember, no one is here to judge anyone else's behaviour.
What the hell are you doing, you lunatic?
Maris is having an affair with Schenkman.
Schenkman?
Whythe contemptible bastard.
He was waiting at the house for herwhen I got there.
I'm so sorry, Niles.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't see how.
They're in love.
They plan to get married.
He told you that?
And she confirmed it when she walked in, once she'd stopped shrieking and we'd coaxed her down off the canopy.
I'm just shocked.
Things seemed to be going so well with the two ofyou.
That's what I thought.
Maybe Maris' feelings for Dr Schenkman aren't real.
Maybe this is simply a case oftransference.
Patients often believe they're in love with their analysts.
- It's very common.
- It's happened to me.
Get out of town.
- I bet that's what's going on here.
- They've never fallen in love with me.
Maris is easily influenced.
Not even that fat lady who brought me fudge.
I'd be a fool to let her go.
Niles, you're just grasping at straws.
I owe it to my marriage to give it one more shot.
- How?
What more could you do?
- I can talk to her alone.
Make her understand what a mistake she's making.
Let's bear one thing in mind.
Sometimes a marriage is just bad, doomed, and no amount of discussion will save it.
Well, then, shall we resume?
No, Daphne, you have fun.
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
We'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
Dad?
No, he's not even back from his big date yet.
Maybe I'll see him in the morning, too.
All right.
Yes, it is a very romantic story.
Yes, yes.
OK, Daphne.
Yes, they do make a very cute couple.
Anyway Right, Daphne, yes.
I suppose they do owe it all to you, don't they?
There's the door.
OK.
Niles.
I thought you were talking with Maris.
It's over.
Let her marry Schenkman.
They deserve each other.
I'm sorry, Niles.
What happened?
I reached the front gate and was just about to ring the doorbell to ask her to let me in when it suddenly dawned on me how many hours I have spent pleading with that woman through gates, through windows, through keyholes and through transoms and, in one disastrous instance, through the pet door.
Yes, I remember dabbing Bactine on those Chihuahua bites.
Well, I decided no more.
I actually looked up at the house and said, "Goodbye, Maris".
"l hope you have a happy life, but I don't have to take any more of your crap".
And I turned on my heel and walked away.
That's a courageous decision.
- How do you feel?
- Not bad, surprisingly.
I'm glad I went over.
I needed the closure.
Now that it's over, I feel a little sad, of course, but also strangely liberated.
I'm very proud ofyou.
Dad, you're back.
How did things go with Mrs Crowley?
Great.
Fabulous.
Right up to the time she introduced me to my date.
- I thought she was your date.
- So did l. Turns out my date was her mother.
a miscommunication when she invited me.
I'm almost afraid to ask this.
How was "Mom"?
She was very nice.
Sleepy.
Showed me pictures of her great-grandchildren.
Couldn't remember any of their names.
She couldn't remember mine either.
We could all use a little something from the bar.
I could use a big something.
- It hasn't been a good day all around.
- Maris and I have split up for good.
I'm sorry.
- She's in love with someone else.
- Niles, are you all right?
I will be.
Well, this may come as small consolation to you, but I believe that you each have a lot ofwork to do to catch up to me in the failed romance department.
Divorced twice, Ieft at the altar once.
Well, I haven't exactly been burning things up lately.
Thank you, Dad.
Things with Sherry fizzled, then Sleeping Beauty tonight.
I think maybe I deserve the booby prize.
I'll challenge you.
Fifteen years with Maris, I end up in bed with her lover.
I didn't need to hear that.
No, it was an accident.
It was pitch dark.
I thought he was Maris.
It's a natural mistake.
What tipped you off?
The heat from her side of the bed.
Well, I think we have a three-way tie.
Here's to the Crane boys, love's big losers.
I said I needed closure.
I won't have it until I do one more thing.
Niles, from this height that can hurt somebody.
All clear.
Goodbye, Maris.
You've hurt me for the last time.
Niles, is that your Mercedes parked down there?
Good body shop will be able to pound that out.
Well, it's Saturday night.
Here we are.
Again.
Wonder how many women are out there tonight without a date.
Thousands.
Thousands of opportunities for us to humiliate ourselves.
Well, come and get us, Seattle.
Three Cranes, no waiting.
We're desperate.
- We're ludicrous.
- We're pathetic.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Good show today, Roz.
I thought that Oh, my God, there's Connie from Promotions.
Every time she sees me, she hits me up for another charity.
Maybe it's time to set some limits.
How hard can it be to say no just once?
Look who I'm talking to.
Hi.
Roz, I was looking for you.
Before you say anything, there's something I need to say.
I have bought Girl Scout cookies, paid for your kids' band uniforms, I bought tickets to every raffle your church ever had.
So whatever you came to say, I'm not interested.
I'll just go then.
By the way, my church had its raffle drawing yesterday.
You won the grand prize.
Sorry to bother you.
Connie.
I'm sorry.
Connie, don't.
Who cares?
What did I win?
Oh, my God.
It's that free ski weekend.
Listen to this/ "Dear Winner".
"You'll enjoy a one weekend rental of a private ski lodge on Mount Baker complete with lessons from a former Olympic champ".
That is a grand prize, indeed.
I'm just a bit envious.
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
It seems a pity you won't be able to take advantage ofthose ski lessons.
There'll be other stuffto do.
Tons.
Just because you can't ski, or for that matter, hike, sled or snowboard, it doesn't mean you can't curl up by a roaring fire with a warm snifter of Sorry.
- Well, the scenery will be nice.
- Breathtaking.
I just hope you can endure the four-hour drive up there, and you so carsick these days.
I know what you're hinting at.
This is the first thing I've won in my life, and it means something to me.
So I won't sell it or trade it for a - Big-screen TV?
- Key's in the envelope.
Why do you need that so loud?
You've gone deaf as a post.
It's just a cold stopping up my ears.
I'll be fine.
Whose lawyer are you, anyway?
No, I will not calm down.
They call that a settlement?
You call them and turn it down.
- I said turn it down, you ninny.
- You could at least ask nicely.
I've got to get a new divorce lawyer.
Claude is no match for Maris' team.
Real sharks, are they?
I once sent Maris a Valentine that said, "You're the girl my heart adores.
Everything I have is yours".
Now they're calling it a pre-nup.
That's terrible.
Can you imagine using that as a weapon?
- An old Valentine.
- I'd love a cold Ballantine.
You're getting a hearing aid.
I don't need a hearing aid.
My hearing will be back to normal in no time.
Soon you won't be able to hear a word I say.
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?
Why are you all loitering around when you should be packing?
- Packing for what?
- The ski weekend I'm taking us on.
You're kidding.
With an Olympic champion in residence to give us lessons.
It sounds like heaven.
Skiing, then warming up with a hot rum drink, curled up under a blanket in front of a roaring fire.
I can feel the steam rising off my toddy already.
- I can't go.
- Why not?
It's Annie's birthday and I promised I'd spend it with her.
- Bring her along.
- She's gung-ho for sports.
She was captain of the girls' rugby team at school.
I'm not sure how many bedrooms there are.
She can have mine.
- Where will you sleep?
- I'll think of something.
- Are you sure you wouldn't mind?
- Why not?
What could be more fun than a gung-ho girls' rugby captain?
I will kill you forthis.
Itwas the onlyway Daphne was going to come and I wasn't going to let a moonlit ski lodge go to waste.
You filed for divorce a week ago.
Can't you wait?
Wait?
I have waited five long years for this.
- Dad, don't you think it's about time?
- I got ten after five.
If you want to make a fool out of yourself with Daphne, go ahead.
But I will not have you ruin my ski weekend by inviting this girl who sounds like an avalanche risk.
I'm going to tell Daphne no guests.
I called Annie.
She's all excited.
She just bought new skis with the money she made off her new swimsuit calendar.
I hope you're happy.
We're stuck with her now.
Look at this place.
Look at this place.
Nothing like a change of scenery, huh?
Where do you suppose the TV is?
This place is terrific.
I'm just glad we got here alive, the way you were taking those curves.
Poor Annie kept getting thrown up against you.
What can I say?
I'm a bad driver.
I grant you she's cuddly, but don't you find her a tad, what would the polite euphemism be, stupid?
Niles, she is just unschooled, like Eliza Doolittle.
You find herthe right Henry Higgins, she'll be readyfor a ball in no time.
Leave it to you to put the "pig" back in Pygmalion.
This place is just lovely.
Yes, isn't it?
Look at that vista.
It's stunning.
Puts one in mind of the Matterhorn.
I wouldn't know.
I'm not very musical.
That's a relief.
The way you were swerving on the ride up here, I was afraid these would get broken.
I'm going to make some hot buttered rum.
It's cold in the mountains.
You need a little fat in your booze.
Good thinking, Dad.
And I'll whip us up a nice batch of pork nog.
Daphne, let me help you with your luggage.
What room did you want?
That one on the left should have a nice view.
Right next to my room.
- I'll take the one next to that.
- Right.
Let me take that for you.
That Niles is quite a cutie.
- He's the one getting divorced?
- Yeah.
He's been just miserable.
- I may just have to cheer him up.
- You just leave Dr Crane alone.
I've seen the way you go through men.
The last thing he needs - is someone else to break his heart.
- But it's my birthday.
- Besides, you're not his nanny.
- Let's just have a relaxing ski trip.
Does this weekend have to be about sex?
Hello.
- I am Guy.
- Daphne.
Annie.
I hope you are ready to ski tomorrow.
I am going to work you very hard.
- Dibs on the Frenchman.
- You can have him.
- He's not half as cute as Dr Crane.
- Enough.
My ears are burning.
Everyone, did you meet Guy, our ski instructor?
I will also be your chef.
Tonight, entrec√¥te √† la Guy.
A ski champion and gourmet.
Vous √™tes formidable.
- Vous √™tes formidable.
- Parlez fran√ßais?
J'ai habit√© √† Paris quandj'√©tais un √©tudiant.
- You speak very well.
- Oui.
You speak French as well?
No, all I know how to say is oui.
That should be enough to get you through the weekend.
Look at that, two deer in the snow, just kind of nuzzling each other.
How romantic.
Yes, it's enough to put ideas in one's head.
Isn't it?
Yes.
I should say so.
Absolument.
Look at you.
You're handy, you're a chef, a ski champ.
- Is there anything you don't do?
- There are a few things.
Niles, you look tr√®s √©l√©gant.
Well, I simply had to change.
After all that rum and good food, I thought I was going to burst out of my trousers.
- Dr Crane, what a smashing robe.
- Well, thank you.
- Doesn't he look handsome?
- Yes, quite.
Look at this.
I've finished my buttered rum.
Frasier Crane would never allow a woman to go thirsty.
Daphne, see if Dad's finished with that second batch.
- Two more.
- All right, almost there.
I just have to replace some of this rum.
Just what Annie needs.
She's all over Dr Crane as it is.
Why couldn't Annie be hot for Frasier?
- What?
- Annie.
Hot for Frasier.
I should just forget about those two and concentrate on Guy.
Now he's the sort oftall drink ofwater I could really go for.
There you go.
It's the rum I'm after.
It'll be just the thing to clinch things with Annie.
Annie?
I know something about that.
She's hot for you.
- Says who?
- Daphne.
She said, "Annie's hot for Frasier".
I knew my charms would work.
I should register this dressing gown with the love police.
I know the pain you're going through.
I've never been divorced myself, but my last boyfriend was eventually.
What you need is something to take your mind off it.
What always works for me - Time to go upstairs.
- What for?
I need to give you your birthday present.
It's in me room.
I'll see you in a bit.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Daphne did not like the way Annie was flirting with you.
- No, she didn't, did she?
- No.
In fact, she dragged her right offto her bedroom.
I think I know what that means.
You like it?
I thinkwe both know.
Daphne was jealous.
She was jealous, wasn't she?
I don't believe it.
I am surprised by nothing.
I think you did not like Annie's flirting either.
- ltwas that obvious?
- Annie's not your cup of tea?
Just between us, my interests lie elsewhere this weekend.
Really?
Rum's ready.
Guy, perhaps you could help my dad with the drinks.
- At your service.
- Thank you, Guy.
- Daphne wants me.
- She told you that?
No, but Annie was flirting with me, and Daphne dragged her off in a jealous rage.
- No, Annie's hot for me.
- I know when I'm being flirted with.
Niles, you really are the limit sometimes.
You're delusional.
Next thing you know, you'll be telling me that Guy's after you.
How do you like your rum?
It's kind of small, but it has a nice view.
- No, your rum.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I wonder if it's clouded my judgement about something.
Your son, Niles is it my imagination, or is he attracted to?
Hold it right there.
It's not your imagination.
He's got it bad.
Really?
This is not a delicate subject for you?
No.
Niles has had those feelings foryears.
I didn't encourage it during his so-called marriage, but now that he's free, whatever makes him happy.
I say go for it.
You are a wonderful father.
OK, everybody, come and get it.
Daphne, just in time.
Well, Annie, that's a lovely gown.
Daphne just gave it to me.
- Really?
- I bet she did.
Dad, this is even stronger than the last batch.
The first time I made it was for your mother.
I wanted to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no.
This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big "yes".
And that wasn't the only yes I got from her that night either.
Still scares me how close I came to chickening out.
You know, as you get older, it's not the failures that you regret or the times you made an ass ofyourself.
It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve.
- Wise words.
- Hear, hear.
Faint heart never won fair lady.
I'd hope that if a man fancied me, he wouldn't be afraid to take a chance, go for a bold gesture.
Yes, we must never be too timid to pursue our heart's desire.
And not give a damn what the world thinks.
Right, Miss Moon?
Indeed.
It takes an hour to make one ofthese but it's worth it just to sit here and savour every sip.
- I'm done.
- Time for bed.
Wait, you're not going already, are you?
Oh, all right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Enjoy your rum.
I'd enjoy it more if it had a TV in it.
- I thought Daphne's room was - They must have switched.
- Sorry, I took the wrong room.
- I thought we got that backwards.
No harm done.
- Annie?
- Daphne?
- Good night, Niles.
- Good night.
Hello?
Hello.
I know what you want.
Don't be timid.
Go for it.
Daphne?
- Hello, it's Niles.
- Just a moment.
I can't wait.
If I don't say this now, I may lose my nerve.
I need you.
I've wanted you since the moment I laid eyes on you.
- I feel the exact same way.
- Annie!
I see you're surprised.
I've tried to send you signals, but as usual I was too damned subtle.
Promise you won't mention this to Daphne.
- My lips are sealed.
- Not for long, I hope.
Come in.
Guy!
- Niles, I thought I heard you in here.
- What do you want?
Niles, you told me you wanted to see that thing.
You know, in my room.
Yes, thank you for reminding me.
- What thing?
- It won't take long.
Catch you later.
Boy, that was close.
I owe you a big one.
Your room?
Good point.
She's next door.
She's bound to hear me in there.
We can go in my room.
Much safer.
No matter how hard I try, I'm bound to make noise.
Me.
too.
- Daphne.
- Dr Crane.
Miss Moon.
Is your room not satisfactory?
I seem to have made a dreadful mistake.
- What are you doing in Guy's room?
- Is this Guy's room then?
- I was looking for Annie's room.
- Now it makes sense.
- I'll just go.
- Wait for me.
The hall is very dark.
I'll show you the way.
- My room should be safe now.
- Very well.
I'll see you later.
Excellent, yes.
- Dr Crane?
- Hello.
Frasier.
- What were you doing in Guy's room?
- Just saying good night.
- We're off to say good night to Annie.
- Good night to you, Dr Crane.
Yes, thank you.
So, Annie - How long will you be?
- Just a minute or two.
- Right.
- Is that champagne?
Yes.
I was just about to deliver it to Dad.
Well, carry on.
Wait, before you see Annie, can you come to my room?
- What for?
- There's something I need to tell you.
This may come as a surprise to you - Annie!
- Daphne!
I told you to leave Dr Crane alone.
- Yes, you wanted him all to yourself.
- I do not want him all to myself.
I see.
It's a threesome you're after.
Well, I don't do those anymore.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I don't see how.
You barged into my room five minutes ago and told me how much you wanted me.
- You did?
- Well, technically, yes.
Then as soon as this one bats her eyes, it's shove off, Annie.
This is the worst birthday I've ever had.
Dr Crane, I'm so sorry.
I've ruined everything.
What I said to Annie, I can explain.
No, it's none of my business.
I've had enough embarrassment for one night.
- Dr Crane.
- Daphne.
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry.
Wrong room.
- Just get out of here right now.
- So it's this room I want then?
- Just go.
- Yes, bye-bye.
Sorry again.
Bonsoir.
Guy.
- You are not the Crane I want.
- You're not even the sex I want.
Where is Niles?
Niles.
Company.
What are you doing in here with Guy?
Don't be jealous, Niles.
It's not how it looks.
What?
As much as I'd like to help you sort this thing out, there is a beautiful woman in here who wants me desperately.
- Annie.
- Go away.
Get out.
What's going on?
Guy.
How dare you barge in on me when I'm naked?
My father told me that were hot for me.
- Your father did?
- Blame Daphne.
She told him.
I said she wanted your brother.
Could Niles and l please have some privacy?
You're just putting the moves on everyone, aren't you?
Would you kindly get out of my bed?
I am not gay, Guy.
Acknowledge your true nature.
Stop chasing these lesbians.
Lesbians?
- Your father told me you wanted me.
- My father said I wanted you?
Hold it down.
There are people here trying to sleep.
My ears must have popped.
I can hear again.
Well, good night, all.
I suggest we all forget this ever happened and just go to bed.
Wait, everybody.
Let me see if I can get this straight.
All the lust coursing through this lodge tonight, all the hormones virtually ricocheting offthe walls, and no one was chasing me?
See you at breakfast.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Good afternoon, Betsy.
I'm listening.
Hi, Dr Crane.
My husband wants to take me on a cruise for our anniversary.
That sounds enchanting.
Except I keep having this dream where I'm in a cabin, and I see a few drops of water, it's starting to leak in.
At first it's just a trickle, then it's gushing, pouring water everywhere and there's nothing in the world that I can do to stop it.
That's a very powerful image, wouldn't you say so, Roz?
Roz agrees.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Frasier Crane.
Lilith, it's me, Roz Doyle.
Yes, Frasier's fun-loving producer.
Who's apparently been having a bit too much fun Ioving.
I'd love to send one back at you, but I've got to pee.
Well, that's all the time we have for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you a good day and good mental I'm sorry.
Someone just walked in the room and frightened me.
My ex-wife.
If you're a regular listener, you know what I'm talking about.
We'll see you Monday.
Hello, Lilith.
- Surprise.
- We're a little past that now.
What brings you to Seattle?
The National Conference on Self-Psychology.
- How is Frederick?
- Fine.
We have an amazing child.
Yes, we have.
- And Brian?
- Fine.
I have an amazing husband.
So, did you two get the gift basket I sent you for the holidays?
What did you do to her?
Nothing.
I sent her a gift basket.
Fruits and festive nuts.
No, it's not the basket, you nit.
It's Brian.
He left me.
Maybe I should go.
No, everyone else knows it.
You might as well know it, too.
Brian was looking for someone a bit more feminine.
And he found him.
Stan Jablonsky, that little hussy.
Oh, Lilith I am genuinely sorry.
I didn't know where to turn but I knew somehow you would be here for me.
- So you didn't come for the conference?
- No.
You shouldn't be alone tonight.
Niles and I are going to the Union Club.
Would you like to join us?
Thankyou, Frasier.
I'd love to.
I don't know if I deserve your compassion, but I feel better already just holding your strong, comforting hands.
You know, I'll always be here for you.
I could stay in these arms all day.
You'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.
Station manager.
Very important.
Can't be broken.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye-bye.
That's rough, leaving you for another man.
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none at all.
Stan was a contractor we'd hired to expand our master bedroom.
It's ironic, isn't it?
No sooner do I get the closet of my dreams than my husband comes out of it.
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.
- That bun looks good.
- Remember your diet.
Speaking of buns I could do without, Lilith is back.
That explains why blood was pouring from all myfaucets this morning.
Go easy on her.
Her husband has left her.
And get this for a man.
Damn.
I owe Dad five dollars.
She's devastated.
Her world's been turned upside down.
But you know better than anyone how a messy divorce can leave one strangely relaxed.
- Niles?
- Yes.
- Am I boring you?
- Did I do it again?
I'm sorry, Frasier.
I'm suffering a bout of narcolepsy.
Good Lord.
When did this start?
After we started divorce proceedings.
I checked with my doctor.
It's a reaction to stress.
My way of escaping the whole ugly mess.
Go on with what you were saying.
Lilith is distraught and she's come to me to help her make sense of it.
I find it just a bit disconcerting.
- How so?
- We have a destructive pattern.
Whenever she comes to me in need, I find her vulnerability desirable.
We end up in bed and I'm left with feelings of regret.
- And you felt this way about hertoday?
- Oh, baby!
Well, do your best to avoid her.
- She's coming to the Union Club.
- What?
She's going to be there?
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts talking about their portfolios and prostates.
Exactly, and you've ruined it.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Damn.
It's one of Maris' cadre of lawyers.
We've been over that.
No, I can't.
How dare you?
She already has the house.
I'm not even allowed to visit the koi pond.
Niles.
I'm not even allowed to visit the koi pond.
Give me that!
He will call you back.
Aren't we a pair?
A narcoleptic and a weak-willed sexual obsessive.
We look like a couple of brothers out of an O'Neill play.
Come on, boy.
Daph, come down here.
I taught him a new trick.
I was reading in a movie magazine there's a stunt dog they taught to ride a motorcycle into a burning building, pick up a baby then jump out the window to safety.
What did you teach Eddie?
To roll over.
You must be very proud.
Forget it, Eddie.
- Hey, Niles.
- Evening, Dad.
Daphne.
Hello, Niles.
Sherry?
We have time before Lilith arrives.
- You never said she was coming here.
- You said you were going to dinner.
It's just to rendezvous.
It's all of two minutes.
You never told me.
Not a word.
Did he say anything to you?
No.
We could have made plans to be elsewhere.
How come you didn't know about it?
You used to know these things.
All right, she's coming.
Both ofyou, suck it up.
Lilith has had a devastating week.
Her husband has left her.
Show a little compassion, unless you'd like to hide in your rooms iftwo minutes of polite conversation with her is too much to ask.
- Out of my way.
- Me, too.
Leave it!
Remember, I'm here for you ifyou feel yourself starting to weaken.
I'm fine.
Believe me, I am in complete control.
Oh, baby.
Thank you, Frasier.
I needed that.
I treated myselfto a little shopping.
Probably just a pathetic attempt to compensate for the battering my ego's taken recently.
- It's pretty transparent, huh?
- No, but ifyou stand in the light Niles, sorry to hear your marriage ended in a shambles.
Ditto.
Now that we've got the pleasantries out ofthe way, let me take your wrap.
Yowsa!
Lilith, that dress is stunning.
- Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
- No.
It's from a new couture line called Encore.
Bravo.
I can almost feel the curtain rising.
Frasier.
Excuse us, we'll be right back.
Eddie will entertain you.
Hello, Eddie.
Damn her.
She knows what she's doing dressing like that.
The woman plays me like a lute.
I guess you know about that.
I've got all the resistance of a horny stag.
Niles, you've got to help me.
Niles?
- Did I do it again?
- With your cheek against the ice tray.
That's so strange.
I dreamt I was tangoing with Maris.
I need your help resisting Lilith.
All right, let me think.
I think I have the answer.
When you feel yourselfyielding to her, summon an image so repellentyou'll be incapable of any sexual desire.
Remember at Uncle Henry's farm we found that dead horse lying in the sun, - crawling with maggots?
- Yes, of course.
Hold on to that picture.
You can ride that horse to safety.
Thank you, Niles.
That might just do the trick.
When it comes to an ugly image, you can't beat a dead horse.
Feel up to facing her again?
Yes.
Let her bat her eyes all she wants to.
She can push her breasts up to Canada.
I won't budge.
Morning.
Morning.
My God.
What did we do?
What did we do?
- First you put your - I know what we did.
What do we do now?
Let's try to stay calm.
These things happen.
They happen every day.
Every day in Arkansas.
Frasier is going to kill us.
Why did you have to look so bewitching?
Why did you have to drive me home?
There's no point in pointing fingers.
We both know why this happened.
Last night was two wounded people overcome with loneliness and confusion - and - Tequila shooters.
- Who's that?
- Don't panic.
No one knows we're here.
- I told Frasier I was driving you home.
- Why do a stupid thing like that?
It wasn't stupid at the time.
How did I know when we got in this room you'd be on me like a hawk on a titmouse?
Just be quiet.
- Who is it?
- Room service, ma'am.
That's right.
We ordered breakfast last night.
Good morning, ma'am.
Morning, sir.
I have eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine.
- Did you bring ketchup?
- No.
I'm sorry.
- Let me get that for you right now.
- Ketchup on eggs Florentine?
- Your first breakfast together?
- Just get it.
Now I remember ordering this.
It's the breakfast I always have after a night of passion.
- Eggs Benedict?
That's very rich.
- I only have it once a year.
- That was quick.
- Lilith, are you awake?
It's Frasier.
Just a second.
- What do we do?
- Hide in the bathroom.
No, not you.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Take the cart with you.
Wait.
Food in the bathroom?
Lilith?
Hello, Frasier.
What are you doing here?
Surrendering, Lilith.
I'm yours.
- No, Frasier.
- Please don't punish me for playing hard-to-get last night.
It was everything I had to resist you.
This isn't right.
Can you saythat in bed last night you weren't thinking about me?
Yes.
Drop the mask, Lilith.
We both knowwhyyou came to Seattle.
We both know why you dressed so enticingly last night.
- Is someone in your bathroom?
- No.
It's a defective toilet.
It's been doing that all night.
I think I'll just go check it right now.
- Niles.
- Yes?
You fell asleep and flushed the toilet.
Damn.
Is he still here?
- Yes.
He wants to make love to me.
- Does the man have no scruples?
He asked me last night to keep him away from you.
The minute my back is turned, he sneaks here, yes, I'm aware of the irony.
I'll just ask him to leave.
- My God.
- My goddess.
- Room service.
- Go away.
- I have your ketchup, ma'am.
- Not necessary.
- OK, but I need the bill.
- Later.
Let's just take care of this.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Here's the ketchup.
Sorry it took so Iong.
I still need the bill.
Where's the cart?
- In the bathroom.
- Why is it in the bathroom?
I was going to take a hot bath while I ate.
Still, food in the bathroom.
Be right back.
Well, this is a little embarrassing.
My ex-wife.
We're sort of reconnecting.
Yes, sir, that's wonderful.
It may just work out this time.
OK.
There you go.
There's a generous, generous tip in there for you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Why don't you send up an order of eggs Benedict?
No reason why she should eat alone.
OK.
Now, where were we?
- This isn't a good time for this.
- Why not, Lilith?
Please, we're alone.
We're here.
You need your Frasier.
- What the hell was that?
- Wait!
No, don't go in there.
- Niles.
- Yes?
My God!
- Frasier, I'm sorry.
- Frasier, it was a mistake.
Stop it, Niles.
Don't tell me how it was.
I've just got to get out of here.
Frasier, you - This is my worst nightmare.
- You have egg on your face.
- That is an understatement.
- No, actual egg.
It's in your hair, too.
- I knew you couldn't stay mad at us.
- I'm in a bathrobe, you jackass.
I can understand your shock and if I could erase last night, I would.
But ifyou could just look at this rationally, just for a moment.
We didn't technically do anything wrong.
What?
You didn't do anything wrong?
I'm a little unclear on that myself, but I'm willing to go along with it.
You are I are no longer married.
Neither is Niles.
I won't say this is my shining hour, but we are not responsible to you or anyone else for our actions.
- You're defending what you did?
- Just listen.
The past few days have been the worst of my life.
I have never been less self-assured, more in need ofvalidation, both as a person and especially as a woman.
- Niles was feeling the same thing.
- Exactly.
Wait a minute.
Our physical reaction to each other was nothing more than a desperate attempt to reaffirm our own worth.
That is very impressive, Dr Sternin.
But l, too, happen to be a psychiatrist.
Let me tell you what actually transpired.
This was a passive-aggressive manifestation of your deep resentments toward me.
Niles, you were punishing me for my notoriety.
You, for my successful adjustment after our divorce.
It is this shared bond that brought the two ofyou to your palace of sweet revenge.
Allow me to rebut/ What a crock.
- It is not.
- It is so.
It's an example of your self-absorption which is why we could not stay together.
I have a right to Why am I defending myself?
Ifyou ask me, you are both off the mark.
Last night was about two people ruled by very powerful superegos, tortured by them, who found a chance, however misguided, to break through and rediscover their ids together.
Call me an old softy, but that's how I see it.
OK, then.
The three of us have certainly analysed the crap out of this.
Yes, where do we all go from here?
I don't know.
That's my cell phone.
It's in my jacket pocket.
Ifyou had given in to me last night instead of this morning, the three of us would not be in this hell.
No, it would be the two of us in a whole different hell.
I've been manipulated byyou jackals enough.
I'll see you in court.
The very idea that Maris still thinks she can I'm not sleeping.
That conversation should have put me out like a light.
It's not surprising.
Your experience with Maris has been emasculating.
Last night may have gone a long way toward restoring your self-confidence.
Of course.
And by the same token, you can now give up the assumption that Brian left you because you're unattractive.
You have evidence to the contrary.
Yes, I have.
To hell with Brian.
If he wants a prissy little wife, he can keep Stan.
Isn't this peachy?
Everything's turned out fine.
You two have solved your problems.
The waiter received a handsome tip.
Niles and I have matching bathrobes.
And it's not even 9.30 yet.
Frasier, try to understand.
- What happened last night was - Stop it, both of you.
Enough.
It happened and I'm just going to have to deal with it.
I suppose in a twisted way there is one positive for me in this.
You see, Lilith, I have never stopped desiring you, even though I know we are wrong for each other.
But now, from this day forward, whenever I look at your face, I will see the back of my brother's head.
And that is one bucket of ice water, let me tell you.
- You know, Frasier - Enough, Lilith.
Maybe I'll just go have some breakfast.
Are we OK?
No, we're not.
But we will be.
Well, that's enough for now.
We're an odd little family, aren't we?
Room service.
Here's your eggs Benedict.
If you could just OK.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
That's all the time we have, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you good afternoon and good mental health.
If I ask your opinion about something, will you give me an honest answer?
Absolutely, Roz.
Any time.
All you have to do is ask.
- I knew it.
- No, I'm just kidding.
I love it.
It looks great.
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.
It's just in my condition I'm a little insecure.
Every time I see something cute in the window, I remember how I look and I think no way.
- Here we go again.
- That's my cousin.
- Nikos, what are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.
It's great to see you.
It's been ages.
Meet my producer Roz Doyle.
This is Nikos, my father's brother's son.
I would've never pegged you for a Crane.
- He gets his looks from his mom.
- Bet he gets looks from lots of women.
- It's nice to meet you.
- I never knew Frasier had a cousin.
He's ashamed of me.
Why else would he turn down my wedding invitation?
- You're getting married?
- Yeah, on Saturday.
- You didn't get the invitation.
- No.
I knew Mom was lying when she said she never heard back from you.
She must still be nursing that grudge.
This sounds like private family stuff.
So, what's this grudge you're talking about?
Mom has never forgiven Frasier for some career advice he gave me.
And, trust me, he saved me from going down the wrong path.
Thank you, Nikos.
I certainly hate to miss this wedding.
I wonder ifthere's some way we could work this out.
- So, what was the wrong path?
- It's a long story.
My folks wanted me to go to medical school.
- What did you choose?
- We don't have I became a juggler.
I perform on street corners.
I see.
And all because of his advice.
- Do people sometimes toss you coins?
- Sure.
Lots of times.
Well, here's something you can catch them in.
It's all your fault.
I have to monitor your blood pressure and I'd like an accurate reading.
- Why don't we try to solve this?
- She's a vindictive woman and she'll keep punishing us.
Ifyou'd keptyour big trap shut my nephewwould probably be a surgeon now and I'd be going to his wedding.
That sounds about right.
I'd loved to have gone, but this is clearly a snub and we Crane men have our pride.
You're just afraid of seeing Cousin Yvonne.
Who's Cousin Yvonne?
A distant cousin who has a slight crush on Niles.
A slight crush.
There are cannibals who are less man-hungry.
It would be romantic to have a secret admirer.
Someone who longed for me that much.
But I do see your point.
When you think about it, it is kind of sick.
Perhaps sick is a tad judgemental.
Because ofyour big mouth Zora won't even let me in her restaurant.
Forcing you to go elsewhere when you have a craving for stuffed grape leaves and zither music.
It's a moot point.
We're not invited, thanks to Frasier's inept advice.
Can you imagine living in the same city as your brother - and not see him for five years?
- No, but I'd like to give it a try.
Dad, I think we should go to this wedding.
- Zora doesn't want us there.
- But Nikos wants us there.
I watched him grow up.
I want to see him get married.
I'd like to venture an opinion here.
I know this doesn't concern me, but I feel very strongly about this.
I like zither music and I always have.
And we're back.
Listen, Dad Drop it, Frasier.
If my brother's wife doesn't see fit to send me an invitation, I am not just going to show up.
End of story.
Case closed.
That's all she wrote.
There are more important issues at stake here than you being mauled by Yvonne the Terrible.
Dad is hurt.
Can't you see that?
He misses his brother.
This is my fault, and I'm going to put it right.
I'm going to get in touch with Aunt Zora.
Surely she'll listen to reason.
Aunt Zora.
Well, that's encouraging.
She remembered my voice.
Frasier, just give up.
No.
She can't avoid me if I go to that restaurant.
- Do you have a death wish?
- I'm not afraid of her.
Have you forgotten that when Hitler invaded Greece, she joined the partisans - so she could strangle Nazis?
- I have never believed that.
She would have been five at the time.
That's why the legend says they were strangled with jump ropes.
Dimitri, pick up your order.
Don't make me hurt you again.
Aunt Zora, I realise I'm not the most welcome person here but It is not fair to take my mistake out on your husband or my father.
- They didn't do anything.
- More pepper.
You have a wedding.
You should be joyous.
Sponge offthis countertop.
Nikos says his fianc√©e's a lovely woman and you like her very much.
You should be full of motherly emotions.
When I find out who bent this skewer, I'm ramming it right in his eye.
I've always wanted to do this, make a trip around the Greek islands.
Aunt Zora, my point is that we are family.
And we should be together.
And I promise ifyou invite us to this wedding, I will never give Nikos another piece of advice for as long as I live.
I'm through meddling.
You have my word.
And ifyou do invite us to the wedding, I'll promote this wonderful restaurant ofyours on my radio programme.
Every day.
For a month.
Frasier.
- You forgive me.
- Of course.
And you come to the rehearsal dinner, too.
Tomorrow night, right here.
Here, eat, my very special kokoretsi for a very special nephew.
I'm such a softy.
I'll be crying in a minute.
Me, too.
I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr "Blessed Are The Peacemakers".
Stop complaining.
The rehearsal went beautifully.
Cousin Yvonne didn't get near you.
How could she?
I hid in the confessional.
By the way, Mrs Pappas is having an affair.
Here they are.
My two favourite nephews.
Ed, get me with the boys.
I am so glad you are coming to the wedding tomorrow.
There is nothing sadder than a divided family.
Am I right?
When Frasier said we weren't invited I remember thinking - There you are, Niles.
- Just kill me now.
- Hello, Yvonne.
- I haven't seen you two in a long time.
I haven't seen your two in a long time.
You too.
Your You too.
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
Let's go get us a glass of bubbly.
- I don't think - It's none of that sissy French wine.
- It's real Greek champagne.
- Save some for me, Niles.
And here he is, my favourite brother-in-law, Marty.
- It's been too long.
- It sure has.
Say, where's Walt?
- We've got a lot of catching up to do.
- Don't worry, he'll be here.
Who is this pretty young thing?
This is Daphne Moon, my physical therapist.
That's what they call it these days.
You dirty old man.
This is my fianc√©e, Mary Ann Taubeneck.
Mary Ann.
It's a pleasure.
Taubeneck, as in the Taubeneck Building?
Yeah, and Taubeneck Park, etcetera, etcetera.
That was my grandfather, the original robber baron.
- Mary Ann has issues with her family.
- Look at them sulking over there.
You should've seen them when I told them I was marrying a street person.
- Street performer.
- Right.
They've got it coming after all the debutante nonsense they put me through.
Would you excuse me?
- She's great, isn't she?
- Yes.
How did you two meet?
I performed at one of her parents' garden parties.
They were snooty to me.
That sparked something in her.
She asked me for a date.
She likes to play with her parents' heads.
Yes, well, so did Lizzie Borden.
What do you mean?
I can't help thinking that Nothing.
Just a bad joke.
- She seems like a lovely girl.
- Yeah, she is.
My family adores her.
My mom thinks Crystal's the best thing that ever happened to me.
- Crystal?
- Did I saythat?
I meant Mary Ann.
I must have been admiring that crystal.
That's why I called her Crystal.
It's a good thing you weren't admiring the pork butt.
I'm so nervous I don't know what I'm saying.
I guess it's pre-wedding jitters.
Nikos, go check on the sous-chef, make sure he isn't into the ouzo.
Last time he drank on duty he got his head caught in the duck press.
- How did he manage that?
- With my help.
So, what were you and Nikos talking about?
Don't you worry.
I made you a promise and I'd die before I break it.
Or soon after.
So, you met Mary Ann?
Yes.
You must be very proud.
And relieved.
That son of mine was going steady with a juggler.
Crystal somebody.
Imagine having a daughter-in-law who throws things for a living.
It's embarrassing.
Come, people.
Let's celebrate tonight.
Thanks for settling everything with Zora.
It's my pleasure.
I can't find Walt.
I've been waiting five years for this.
Did you know Nikos and Mary Ann have only known each - There he is!
- You must have so much to talk about.
- Uncle Walt, hello.
- Frasier.
- Marty.
- Walt.
- What's new?
- Same old, same old.
- How's tricks?
- Can't complain.
- They keeping you busy?
- You better believe it.
- What are you gonna do?
- Tell me about it.
It's amazing how you two can pick up right where you left off.
Put those back.
Niles, do you realise how pathetic this is?
At dinner Zora announced that I'd filed for divorce.
Within seconds Yvonne began purring so loudly my allergies kicked in.
I won't be safe till this wedding is over.
A wedding I think might be a serious mistake.
Does this mean you're going to meddle - and get us both thrown out?
- I can't.
I promised I wouldn't.
- Here she comes again.
- Have you seen Niles?
No, I haven't.
- Here we go.
- How much longer do we have to stay?
- What are you in a snit about?
- Thanks to Zora, they're sniggering about me being your physical therapist.
She's always been a pain.
You're telling me.
Dried up old grape leaf.
And she's one to talk about reputations, too.
Before she married my brother, she was easier to make than a peanut butter sandwich.
Does everyone know that?
Everybody except my brother.
I love him dearly, but he's not exactly the brightest bulb in the - Bulb box?
- Yeah.
Here's Eddie.
Hey, Eddie.
Where's the camera?
Then it worked.
It's right here.
I decided to go undercover.
I wanted to get people just being themselves.
We were really boring.
Why don't you rewind it and tape over it?
Funny.
Mrs Pappas said the same thing.
So why did you and Crystal break up?
I'm not meddling.
I'm just curious.
Just interested.
It was a career conflict.
She's a juggler, too.
You may have heard of her.
Crystal Baker?
No, I don't get to street theatre as often as I should.
Fabulous performer.
Fabulous girl, for that matter.
But she wanted to work in Paris and I wanted to stay here.
There's always pressure on a two-career family.
We had a big fight about it.
Then Mary Ann came along.
By the time Crystal got back, I was engaged.
- And how did she take the news?
- She was crushed.
But she's been wonderful.
She called me to congratulate me.
We talked for hours, just like old times.
She's a sweetheart.
She's starting to sound like one.
It was really great talking with her.
I felt happy, purely happy.
It might be the last time I did.
Since then it's been the usual pre-wedding stuff.
The jitters, night sweats, vomiting I promised your mother I would never again interfere in your life.
Interfere?
You saved me from making a terrible mistake.
I value your advice above anything.
All right.
In the interest ofyour future happiness, it's my duty to let you know Nikos, please go make your Uncle Stavros to stop dancing on the table.
It would be nice to have a family gathering where no one leaves in an ambulance.
Am I right?
Yes, wouldn't it?
Eddie, come on, you've been working ever since I've been here.
- You haven't had chance to chow down.
- I wouldn't mind grabbing a bite.
- Hand me that thing then.
- Be careful.
That tape is historic.
I've interviewed every member ofthe family.
I even taped Nikos' great-grandmother.
- 101 years old.
- That's amazing.
She probably has got more stories than anybody else has.
- I can't do this.
- Press this button right here.
Thanks.
Bye.
OK, everybody, gather round.
We're going to have some toasts here.
So if everybody will stop for one minute and Why don't you just hide in the men's room?
Where do you thinkYvonne is right now?
Where have you been?
I've been trying to contact Nikos' ex-girlfriend.
The depths you'll sink to to get a date.
I am convinced that he is still in love with her.
And she with him.
If I could get them together he might realise it in time.
Alas, I couldn't reach her.
Had to leave a message with her roommate.
Perhaps the time has come for you to stop playing games and start being direct.
Frasier?
Where's Frasier Crane?
Oh, dear God.
There you are.
Come up here and make a toast to the happy couple.
I guess a thought or two comes to mind.
I've known Nikos all of his life and I'm sure that he realises marriage is a binding commitment, not to be entered into hastily.
But when the right one comes along, you know it.
And it's very important to find the person that you're most compatible with.
The one who makes you feel "happy, purely happy".
More important, makes me feel happy.
It would be a shame to go through life having to say, "lf I'd only waited".
What the hell kind oftoast is this anyway?
I want to make sure that my cousin marries the woman he truly loves.
Well said.
Cheers, everybody.
Thank you, Frasier.
If I may say a word or two.
My son Nikos and I have had our ups and downs.
But tonight at this moment I can honestly say What the hell are you doing here?
Crystal.
Nikos.
I couldn't let you get married without letting you know that l Nikos, what're you doing?
Stop it.
Her roommate must have called her car phone.
Jugglers have car phones?
Nikos, you are ruining everything.
You, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Nikos.
Sorry, but Crystal's the one I'm meant to be with.
I will never forgive you for this.
See how happy you've made my parents?
Frasier, he's lost his mind.
Talk to him.
Remember my promise?
No more meddling.
Excuse me, everyone.
This may not be appropriate, but I have a toast too, to the man who reunited me with the woman - I plan to spend my life with.
- No, no, inappropriate.
- Toast time is over.
- We want to offer you our thanks.
You know what?
Later on why don't we do some bouzouki dancing?
Why are they thanking you?
We owe our happiness to him.
Why couldn't she have been a mime?
Once again he saved me from making a terrible mistake.
So, everyone, please lift your glasses to my cousin, Frasier Crane.
I can do better than a glass.
No!
Aunt Zora!
Out of my way!
Well, Walt Marty Goodbye again.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Nowfor a difficult one.
Firm, velvety rind, bit smoky.
Applewood, I think.
This is what I get for sending you to camp in France.
Can I help you with anything else?
No, thanks.
This $6 can of dog food will be fine.
It'll sure teach me not to leave my shopping until the last minute again.
- Is it Reblochon?
- You are good, Dr Crane.
Yeah, he's a regular cheese whiz.
I'll take half a pound of the Reblochon and half a pound of Saint Andre and I know I ask this every week, but -is it here?
- Is what here?
You know I mean the imported Swiss prosciutto.
The B√ºndnerfleisch.
I am sorry.
If only you had been here one hour ago.
- Damn.
- You would have seen it arrive.
- I have my fun with you.
- You do, Robert.
I long for the days when you barely spoke English.
Slice like the wind.
I'll take a pound.
salami's good, but it's not that good.
Itwas aged for six months and air-cured in a small village at the foot ofthe Pyrenees.
- A steal at that price.
- You got that right, pal.
Dad, ifyou want to wait outside I'm fine.
Look at all these different kinds of olive oil.
Virgin, extra virgin Extra virgin?
How does that work?
I guess ifyou can cure a sausage Monsieur, I am so glad you find my food so amusing.
Robert, he's only joking.
Keep on slicing.
Come on now.
Even you've got to admit this whole store is kind of nutty.
$14 for a pound of goat cheese?
For that price, I ought to be able to get a whole goat.
And we're slicing.
Perhaps you would be more comfortable ifyou justwaited outside.
You want me to leave, come out and say it.
- Fine.
Leave from my store.
- No problem.
Come on, Niles.
- He wants us to "leave from his store".
- Don't hurry back.
All the money in the world wouldn't get me back in this snob shop.
He is my father.
So I can't leave here with a bag ofyour merchandise.
- Home delivery?
- Thank you.
No one treats my father that way.
Those olives, too.
No one.
About the photo shoot?
Will you need make-up?
Heavens no.
I think that you look very handsome without it.
Really?
I think you look very attractive with make-up.
Not that you need it.
But ifyou are wearing make-up, it's so well applied that I wouldn't even know you're wearing make-up.
Bet it looks like I'm wearing rouge.
I know what you meant.
And thank you.
Dr Crane, I've been meaning to ask you, what do you think about two people who work together dating?
Well, Sharon, I'm asked that question a lot, and the stark reality is that that situation is fraught with delightful possibilities.
- So, are you free on Friday?
- Yes, Friday it is.
After the show.
- Great.
- Great.
- Dr Crane?
- Yes.
Clint Webber.
I'm hosting the new show on health issues.
Of course.
Dr Webber.
Welcome to KACL.
I'm in your debt for recommending my audition tape.
Not at all.
It was very good.
We'd gotten tired ofthe last show that was in that time slot, Bert, the Backyard Gardener.
Rumour that his latest crop gave new meaning to the term "potting shed".
Perfect timing.
Come, Clint.
Roz Doyle, my producer.
This is Dr Clint Webber, the new host of Health Watch.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Great to meet you.
- So, you're new.
- That's right.
- And a doctor?
- That's right.
I don't want to be late for that station tour.
Again, welcome aboard, Clint.
Could I have acted any goofier?
Not without a set of fake buck teeth.
He's so handsome.
I can't work with someone that handsome.
No offence.
Granted, when it comes to the looks department, - Dr Webber and I aren't in the same - Species?
I was going to say league, but species is so much more insulting.
This stinks.
The chicks are going nuts over this Webber guy.
I'm the only sex symbol around here.
Look at this.
Come on.
Come on, take your best shot.
No, whoa, not you.
One of those guys.
Bulldog, you're behaving immaturely, even for you.
There's no reason to feel threatened.
I must confess, I didn't notice he was all that handsome.
You didn't notice?
You of all people?
Just what are you insinuating?
Well, you know, that you're a little For your information, I happen to be a happily married man.
You're married?
To a woman?
Of course to a woman.
You've all heard me mention Deb.
How often have I said, "l must run along.
Deb will be waiting"?
- We thought Deb was your cat.
- She is not a cat.
She is Mrs Gilbert Leslie Chesterton, a Sarah Lawrence graduate and the owner of a very successful auto body repair shop.
Honestly, the conclusions people make just because a man dresses well and knows how to use a pastry bag.
Well, that's the first time I've ever seen a man "in" himself.
Dad, I can't help noticing Eddie's looking a bit glum.
Yeah, he's mad at me.
I gave him a can ofthat dog food from your fancy gourmet place the other day.
- He didn't like it?
- He loved it.
Now he won't eat anything else.
Even turned his nose up at a kosher pickle and he loves those.
I called all over Seattle and Frenchy's the only one who carries that stuff.
- Would you consider apologising?
- I'm never going in that store again.
There is a technique of sleep feeding involving an eye dropper and a high fructose protein shake.
- I don't know about that.
- It worked on Maris.
Hello, Niles, Dad.
Hello, Roz.
How are you doing?
- Frasier, are you aware - Yes, I'm aware.
We were taking publicity photos today.
I had an allergic reaction to the make-up.
I wasn't planning on wearing any but there's a handsome new employee.
Everybody's feeling insecure.
They were all slapping their make-up on, so l, too, gave in to vanity.
And like lcarus, flying too close to the sun, - l, too, paid the price.
- Wow!
I don't go to the mythology well often, but that was spot on.
No, I mean that guy.
He's so handsome.
- It's him.
It's Dr Webber.
- Roz, that's enough.
- He is striking.
- Frasier's jealous.
I am not jealous.
Yes, the man is handsome.
But I'm sure there's a number of areas in which I am his superior.
Good looks can be a mixed blessing.
People roll out the red carpet for you, but that robs you of any incentive to develop other qualities.
After a while you are left an ageing Narcissus, bent at the water's edge, realising those lines in the pond aren't ripples.
- They're wrinkles.
- Amazing.
- I rather liked that one myself.
- That guy could be a movie star.
Roz, don't we have some work to do?
- Take this table.
I have a session.
- Yeah, I've got to go, too.
Like Zeus riding his thunderbolt to Mount Vesuvius.
Very amusing, Dad.
Offyou go.
Dr Crane.
Dr Webber.
You remember Roz Doyle, of course?
Yes, hello.
Who could forget that infectious laugh?
Has anyone had a look at that rash?
- Yes, everybody.
Yes.
- Mind if I join you?
- Actually, we were just - We were hoping you would.
So, Clint, I see that you're a squash player.
If you're up for a game, I used to play a bit back in Harvard.
I'd love to.
Harvard?
I was dying to go to Harvard.
I'm sure your school was just as good.
- I went to Oxford.
- Even better.
- Did you go to medical school there?
- Yes, but I took a year off first to get my masters in French history.
Just wanted to do something fun.
So you speak French?
Seulement quand je rencontre une belle femme.
I understand the importance of time off before beginning medical school.
I spent that summer in Milan studying the history of opera.
I had the good fortune to become friends with a then little-known young tenor by the name of Carreras.
- Jos√© Carreras?
- Forgive the name dropping.
- He's my godfather.
- You're joking.
No, I'll call him tonight.
He'll be delighted to hear I'm working with you.
I wonder if he remembers the game we used to play where we pretended not to remember one another.
That rash is starting to concern me.
I'll pop and get my medical kit.
There's really no need.
OK, maybe we can get some work done while he's gone.
Roz, for heaven's sake.
You behave like a starry-eyed bobby-soxer.
Yes, the man is good looking.
It's not like he can stop traffic.
There's a blind corner out there.
We don't know if that was him.
How was your squash game?
Dr Webber neglected to mention that he was squash champion back in college.
- I'm sorry, Frasier.
- Not at all.
It was a lovely morning.
Clint treated me to breakfast.
Once we arrived at Le Relais, the chef had just cut himself.
Clint not only treated the wound, but made us a flawless egg white and truffle omelette.
I put myself through med school as a sous-chef at Le Cirque.
I just want to pinch you to make sure you're real.
He's real.
I'm going to get a glass ofwater.
I'll be right back.
But you're about to start the show.
I thought I'd have Clint on, give his show a leg up.
You're plugging Clint.
I'm having trouble believing this buddy-buddy act.
Try as you mayto insinuate I am jealous ofthis man, I like Clint.
Why else would I be giving a party in his honourtonight?
You're on in ten seconds.
Slip on those headphones and follow my lead.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Before we start our regular programme, I'd like to introduce you to Dr Clint Webber.
Clint, you'll probably spend a week figuring outwhat all these buttons do.
Actually, in college I ran the radio station.
Things may have gotten a bit more sophisticated since then.
For instance, we have here a cough button.
If I'm not mistaken, that's the echo button.
Of course it is.
All my listeners are familiar with my now trademark echoing cough.
Well, let's go to the lines, take our first call and show Dr Webber the ropes.
- Go ahead, you're on the air.
- Hi, Dr Crane.
It's Marie.
Hello, Marie.
I'm listening.
I've been having a hard time getting out ofbed every morning.
And when I finally do, I'm irritable for hours.
The desire to stay in bed is similar to the desire to regress to the womb.
Some unconscious fear is driving you to a place of safety.
You'll have to examine your life and discover what it is you're retreating from.
It's hard, but very necessary work.
It may be time to try some therapy.
- Wow.
- You are good, Dr Crane.
The thing that came to my head was that she might be hypoglycaemic.
I'd have suggested some protein in the morning.
Wait a minute.
Last Thursday I had eggs for breakfast, and I felt great all day.
- Well, maybe that's it then.
- What a relief.
You scared the life out of me, Dr Crane.
Yes, well, thank you, Marie.
All right, I think it's time to say goodbye to Dr Webber now.
We'll be back after these messages.
- That was fun.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?
- I hope I wasn't out of line.
- No, not at all.
I always enjoy learning something new.
I'll see you tonight.
Don't be late.
- I'm always punctual.
- Of course you are.
I hate him.
He's not here.
A case of that dog food, please.
- Will that be all?
- Yeah, and I'm in a hurry.
Look here.
Nickerson's Lemon Biscuits.
These bring back memories.
- Do you carry the raspberry ones?
- I'm not sure.
- Can you come back for those?
- Robert?
Well, look who's come back.
Why don't you just let me pay for this and get out of here?
What do I owe you?
I think we both know what you owe me.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made fun ofyour store.
Are you going to let me off the hook?
I'll sell it to you.
I never like to lose a customer.
While I'm here, I'll take a few cases.
We have new varieties ifyou'd care to look.
- Sure.
- Please, show the man.
I think these biscuits are mismarked.
- No, that's correct.
- $14.95?
For a package this small?
I see we have another member of the Price Club.
There's no need for that.
Back home I can get these for 80p.
- I do have to fly them over.
- Did you buy them a seat on Concorde?
Ifyou cannot afford them, put them back.
I can bloody well afford them.
- This is robbery.
- Robber?
No one calls me robber.
- Robert?
- Not now.
On your way out, a sign on the door says "please come again".
Disregard it.
I'd be happy to.
Mr Crane was right about you.
You're nothing but an arrogant, swindling little cheese-monger.
This is great.
I'll take a case of each.
You'll take a case of nothing.
- What happened?
- We don't need his food.
Yes, we do.
He's got tarragon flavour now.
- What about Eddie?
- He'll eat when he gets hungry.
For heaven sakes, he drinks out ofthe toilet.
So George S Kaufmann so dislikes what the actor is doing, he sends a telegram reading, "I'm watching your performance from the rear of the house.
Wish you were here".
I believe that's the story you meant to tell.
Thanks for helping out.
Doc, great way to welcome the new guy.
I'm surprised you're even here.
I didn't think you cared much for Clint.
I'm over that.
I figured he can't nab every chick, so ifwe pal around, I bag the leftovers.
You're a regular busboy of romance.
Excuse me.
- Niles.
- How's it going?
Let me see.
What have you missed?
Clint told us about how he learned to fly a plane, then he recited a sonnet.
Then he fixed my ice machine and he invented a new drink, the pink Webber.
I've got Daphne drawing a bath right now.
Ifthe party starts to lag, I can invite him to walk on water to liven things up.
Don't let it make you crazy.
At some point we all run into someone who's our superior.
I've never dealt with this sort of thing before.
Never?
As my younger brother, you've dealt with this sort of thing all your life.
At least he won't outshine you in the egomania department.
Sorry.
Yes, I'm being silly about this, I suppose.
I just wish I could find one flaw, one area where I'm his superior.
I'm sure you will although it won't be in the drink department.
This is heaven in a glass.
I was just admiring this chessboard.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Do you play?
No.
Are you in the middle of a match?
Yes, as a matter offact, I'm playing by mail with a Russian grandmaster.
- It's quite challenging.
- Congratulations.
With your use ofthe Zekrepsky Attack, you're only four moves away from certain victory.
You're right.
And, actually, I'd be happy to hear that, except I'm playing black.
Well, wasn't that a fun eight months?
Excuse me.
Hello, Sharon.
Sorry we haven't had a chance to speak much.
I'm looking forward to our date on Friday.
So am l. You look absolutely beautiful.
Or should I say Why?
What's so funny?
You just told me I'm as lovely as a chicken beak.
Really?
Who's as lovely as a chicken beak?
You speak Mandarin?
I just wanted to thank you for this party.
Don't mention it.
It's been a perfect evening.
The hors d'oeuvres, the company, the music.
I love this song.
Well, enjoy.
I'm sorry.
I was singing too loud.
No, not at all.
I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying hearing it.
Careful, it doesn't take much coaxing to get me to perform.
Really?
Get a glass ofwine in me, I'm serenading the entire room.
Really?
I'm afraid I have a bit ofthe old ham in me.
Would it be presumptuous to sing in front ofyour guests?
I thinkwe could persuade the piano playerto play it again.
Niles, I've done it.
I have found his Achilles' heel.
- Whose?
- Clint's.
I just heard him singing.
He's tone-deaf.
He's about to sing a rendition of Isn't It Romantic?
that will simply peel the enamel from your teeth.
Are you sure you want to let him do that?
- What do you mean?
- You're a wonderful singer.
Isn't it enough to know that?
Do you need to see him humiliate himself?
Yes.
- Now, Frasier - No, you're right.
I guess I am a bigger man than that.
Dr Crane, your friend Clint's quite a charmer.
- Yes, he is, isn't he?
- Do you suppose he's single?
I was going to give him my phone number.
Excuse me, I just want to thank you all for this warm welcome to KACL.
And, as a token of my gratitude, I'd like to share this song with you.
- Clint, there's been a change in plans.
- Yes, I'm going to accompany you now.
Get up.
Please, everybody.
Nobody's perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
What's going on?
I've got an appointment in 20 minutes.
Some weenie complained so nowthey clean the milk steamer after every use.
It was you, wasn't it?
If requesting basic sanitary procedures makes me a weenie, then a weenie be l. - Hi, guys.
- Hey, Roz.
Frasier, what stupid suggestion did you make this time?
Nice to see you, too, Roz.
Sorry.
I just spent two hours trying on jumbo formal wear for the SeaBea Awards.
The size two salesgirl said I could use this again after my pregnancy.
Well, perhaps you could cut off the bow, remove the sleeves, and Stick a pole in it and go camping.
If I'm gonna stick a pole someplace Children.
- Coffee to go.
Black.
- I am looking forward to the SeaBeas.
Why?
You won't win.
They never give it to the MC.
- Now, me I'm a lock.
- You're awfully cocky.
If knowing I'm the best thing on the air makes me cocky, then cocky be l. You're not the only one who can talk classy.
- How is that talking like Lassie?
- Let's just move on, shall we?
Roz, that man, he's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
- Roz, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Bulldog, I can't believe you did that.
- You saved me.
- I did what anyone would have done.
- You were so brave.
- You're a hero.
Close enough.
Excuse me, will you hold that, please?
- Niles.
- I was on my way up to see you.
Niles, what have we determined about your success with impulse purchases?
- The salesman said I could pull it off.
- My suggestion exactly.
- Fine.
Frasier, ask me if I have news.
- I've got some news of my own.
In the cafe today For God's sake.
Niles, do you have news?
First, congratulations on your SeaBea nomination.
- Now congratulate me on mine.
- What?
Ifyou'd bothered to look past your own name, you would've found mine right after it on page fifteen.
"Best Performance by a Guest on an lnformation Show".
It's for that spot I did on KJSB when I discussed the psychological effects of long-term inclement weather.
reducible to one phrase, "Rain, rain, go away".
I'm not surprised you've belittled my nomination.
In your mind, you're the success.
I'm just invisible.
That's not the way the rest of the world sees it.
- Frasier, boy, am I glad to see you.
- Dr Crane, thank goodness you're home.
I'm also here.
- We heard what happened.
- Niles, as I was trying to tell you, there was an attempted armed robbery at the cafe.
- Was anyone hurt?
- No, it was all diffused quickly.
Tempest in a teapot, really.
On a more pleasant topic, this afternoon I found out Niles, hold it.
How did you two hear about it?
- On the news.
- Bulldog really saved the day.
- They said that on the news?
- How he swept Roz out of the way, and then threw his hot coffee on the gunman.
That's not how it happened at all.
Why would he say such a thing?
It was drizzling today and people act strangely when it rains, - as I pointed out in my SeaBea - Shut up, Niles.
Well, then, what did happen?
We were standing at the counter when I noticed a man with a gun.
I warned Roz.
Bulldog saw a different man and thought he was the gunman.
That's when he grabbed Roz and held her in front of him as a human shield.
But as he did that, he knocked his coffee onto the actual gunman, causing him to drop his weapon and run out.
- No one else saw that happen?
- Apparently not.
I can't believe Bulldog would use Roz.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was relieved everyone was all right.
It did irk me when everyone was praising him.
The owner ofthe cafe promised him a lifetime supply of muffins.
I never thought it would go this far.
I neverthought I'd hear it on the news.
I wonder how much that would be, a lifetime supply of muffins.
I'm not going to let Bulldog get away with it.
I've never seen Bulldog eat a muffin.
It would be wasted on him.
- I'll tell him I saw what happened.
- Now me, I could eat a muffin a day, some days even two knowing they'd be free.
So that's maybe ten a week, 52 weeks a year, for at least another 40 years, which works out to 20,000 muffins.
My life suddenly seems long measured in muffins.
Daphne, there are a lot of things that can make life suddenly seem long.
That's all the time we have for today.
Good afternoon, Seattle and good mental health.
- Did you see Bulldog come in?
- No, I've been looking for him myself.
Stop that.
They're for him.
- Do you think he had anything - There he is.
Enough hero worship.
I take my pants off one leg at a time like everybody else.
You can vouch for that, can't you, Myrna?
I made these cookies for you.
I already had a bunch of muffins but there's always room for a cookie.
- Where's the milk?
- Coming right up.
- Hello, Bulldog.
- Hey, Doc.
This hero stuff is the best.
Hey, last night, sisters.
At one point I was a hero sandwich.
Get it?
They were the bread, and I was Yes, I got it.
Just drop it.
I saw what you did yesterday.
- I saved your butt.
- Saved my butt, my ass.
You pulled Roz in front ofyou to protect yourself.
That stinks.
That's total BS.
I'm a hero.
I'm a brave man.
You're not going to tell, are you?
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
You like muffins?
I was determined to expose you but I don't have to.
You'll do it yourself because "a guilty conscience needs no accuser".
That means you won't tell?
Once again, I don't have to because "a guilty conscience sleeps in thunder".
- It means I won't tell.
- 20 seconds, Bulldog.
I'm fascinated as a psychiatrist to watch this little experiment.
I know that you feel bad about what you've done and you'll feel worse every time you capitalise on it.
How long before your conscience overwhelms you?
Sports fans, this is Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.
You're in the doghouse.
Let's go to the phones.
This is Roz Doyle and I have some very exciting news.
Each year at the SeaBea Awards, a radio personality receives the Harold Hirschauer "Man of the Year" award, and this year our winner is our very own Bulldog Brisco, who was chosen for his heroism.
Congratulations, Bulldog.
Well, what do you say to that, hero?
This is incredible.
I really feel honoured but I've got to clear something up.
Yesterday at the cafe, this young lady kept coming up to me and saying, "You're my hero.
How can I ever thank you"?
Well, I got a confession to make.
I lost your number, but if call in, I got an answer for you.
OK, I'm ready.
Go ahead, Daphne.
And the SeaBea goes to Dr Niles Crane.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
To be accurate, it's traditional for the presenter to kiss and embrace the winner.
- Won't your brother be the presenter?
- We can't know that for certain.
Hello, Dr Crane.
We're just practising for Saturday night.
- Best case scenario.
- Obviously.
- Daph, your pie's done.
- Thanks.
- Will you be joining us for dessert?
- No, thank you.
- I'm not hungry.
- Where have you been?
Driving around.
Thinking.
I can't get this Bulldog thing off my mind.
Don't worry about it.
We all get obsessed sometimes.
Just drop it before you startyakking on about it to someone who doesn't give a rat's ass.
Is that your way of saying you don't want to discuss it?
You want to take the direct route?
Why do you care so much about Bulldog?
It's not really Bulldog so much.
I just believe that conscience, more than customs and laws, is what prevents people from doing wrong.
To contemplate a sane man with no conscience, it shakes my entire world view.
In my family conscience is what my dad called his wooden paddle.
How awful for you.
For me brothers, yes, but I knew he'd never use it on me.
As long as I was always good.
As long as I was always polite.
As long as I always had a smile on me face, no matter how I felt.
As long as I was always ready to wait on the men, hand and foot, day and night, year in, year out.
- More coffee, anyone?
- No, just have a seat.
Here, I'll pour for you.
I can't understand how Bulldog can accept all those accolades - and not be tormented by it.
- Maybe he is.
For all you know, he's at home pacing the floor, unable to sleep.
That's a comforting thought, Niles.
But we'll never know for sure, will we?
Well, enough about this.
You know, I think I'm offto bed.
Night, all.
I'm proud of Fras.
Used to be he'd get a bee in his bonnet and never get it out.
- Thought we'd hear about it for weeks.
- He would've been up all night.
He wouldn't have been able to sleep until he went over to Bulldog's to make sure he wasn't sleeping.
I should've told him to pick up some more milk.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.
This isn't a good time.
I got company.
You have done something horrible and I need to know you feel bad.
You been looking through the keyhole?
I'm talking aboutwhat happened with Roz.
- Not this again.
- Bulldog, I'm lonely.
Talk to your sister for a sec.
I'll be right there.
- I've got to go.
- Bulldog.
- Stop that.
- I need to know that you feel remorse.
This is really bugging you.
Well, OK, all right.
The truth is I feel bad.
I feel real bad.
You feel nothing.
These little things just don't get to me.
The little thing in question is using a pregnantwoman as a human shield.
- Have you no conscience?
- Maybe not.
I refuse to believe that.
Maybe I was born without.
Like my cousin.
He was born without a big toe on each foot.
I used to sneak up on him, tip him over.
I didn't feel bad about that either.
See you.
No, I know you've got a conscience.
It's buried deep down inside.
I will get it out ofyou.
You mark my words, I don't know how yet, but Saturday night, you will be so consumed with guilt, you won't be able to accept that Man ofthe Year award.
Daphne.
- You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
Dad, not bad, either.
Thanks.
I guess any guy looks good in a monkey suit.
On the drive I was musing about why they call it a monkey suit.
- I had quite a few theories.
- She sure did.
Can I get a ride home with you?
Roz, is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just that my hair is huge and this dress is a joke.
No, nonsense, Roz.
You look divine.
No, I look like Divine.
I've got to go sit down.
Look at the way the lights are shining on the sequins on this dress.
I'm a disco ball.
It certainly promises to be quite a night.
I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself.
I wasn't sure you would with Bulldog getting that award.
I wouldn't be surprised if Bulldog declines that award.
Why would he?
I've arranged a few surprises to prick his conscience.
Until, like Hamlet's stepfather, he totters from the banquet, ghostly pale and gibbering with guilt.
Could I get a ride home with you?
- Niles.
- Hello, all.
Daphne, you look stunning.
Thanks.
You look very smart.
Thank you.
Of course, I guess it's hard not to look elegant in evening wear.
Hard, but not impossible.
Shall we take our seats?
Yes, although if Dame Rumour is correct, I won't be sitting long.
Listen, now are we all at table 105?
We're at table four.
Excuse me.
Where is this table?
Go down to the basement, through the kitchen and ask for the Napoleon Room.
The Napoleon Room.
That's sounds charming.
We call it that cause the ceilings are so low.
Shame.
Now you won't get to see your brother host or hear all the little jokes he's written.
Thank you, Daphne.
I needed some cheering up.
- Bulldog.
- Let's go this way.
No need to avoid me.
I have no intention of ruining your evening.
- In fact, it's going to be memorable.
- You been sleeping OK?
Don't you worry about me.
I'll sleep fine tonight.
The sleep of the just.
Me, too.
The sleep ofthe just-boinked.
And the nominees are Consumer Forum.
Wendy Yashiro, talent, Mike Freedman, producer.
The Dr Frasier Crane Show.
Dr Frasier Crane, talent, Roz Doyle, producer.
And Bob and Nipsey's Morning Laugh Factory.
Bob and Nipsey, talent, Lunatic Larry, producer.
And the SeaBea goes to Bob and Nipsey's Morning Laugh Factory.
Bob and Nipsey couldn't make it tonight, so I accept this award on their behalf.
That brings us to our final category.
But let's take a short break and we'll be right back with the Man of the Year award.
Sorry you didn't win.
That's all right.
I'm only concerned with one award tonight.
The next one.
- Hey, Dr Crane, how did it go?
- I lost.
Sorry you didn't win.
I've been saying that a lot tonight.
Look, wine.
They didn't serve alcohol at the technical awards, as I informed so many ofthe guests who mistook me for their waiter.
I was the only nominee dressed in black tie, except for the one man in front wearing a tuxedo t-shirt.
- I'm sorry, Niles.
- I didn't come home empty-handed.
We received one of these certificates, given out after we'd folded our tables and stacked our chairs.
Welcome back.
The time has come to present the Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award.
Thank you, Susan.
As you all know, this award is presented every year to the radio personality that brings honour to our medium.
This year that person is Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.
Come on up here, Bulldog.
What a night, huh?
Bob, the night is just beginning for you.
Could we please lowerthe house lights?
What's going on?
A few surprise guests that I've invited to help you celebrate.
People from your past that helped make you the man that you are today.
Do you recognise this voice?
Bobby Brisco, you have made us all proud.
Oh, my gosh.
Is that?
Yes.
It's Father O'Rourke, your boyhood priest and childhood confessor.
And who's there next to him?
Bobby Brisco, sit down in your chair.
That's right.
It's Mrs McCloud, your second grade teacher, the woman who taught you that honesty is the best policy.
- Who's that next to her?
- Drop and give me fifty, Bulldog.
Coach Nuge?
Coach Nugent from your Pee Wee football days.
He taught you it doesn't matter whether you win or lose - but that you play fair.
- You're wasting your time.
And who's that next to him?
It's the president ofyour fan club, Iittle Joey Katona, whose only dream is to grow up and be just like you.
But we're not through yet.
Could we please bring the house lights up again?
We've saved the best for last.
It's the woman that gave everything to you.
You ought to know that one, Deb.
The night would not be complete without the woman who taught you right from wrong.
It's your mother, Bernice Brisco.
Mom!
- I am so proud ofyou, Bobby.
- Oh, Mom.
Let's turn the microphone over to our guest of honour this evening.
I'm sure we're all anxious to hear what the hero has to say.
I'm really blown away by all this.
I didn't think I'd be accepting this in front of all you guys.
I wrote up this little speech.
I can't say this stuff now.
What I've got to say is simple.
This is totally awesome.
Thank you, everybody.
- This can't be happening.
- Let it go.
I can't.
The man is a coward and he's being rewarded.
- I'll never hear the end of this.
- No.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Bulldog, there's a guy there with a gun.
There's a gun.
Sorry, my mistake.
He used his own mother to protect himself.
- lsn't that what you did to me?
- No, I just No.
- What is the matter with you?
- You don't deserve that award.
Thanks, Dad.
I'm no hero.
I just wanted you to shut up.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
-Frasier, Roz.
- Niles.
- I'd join you butthere's not a chair.
- I was just leaving.
Niles, every time I give you my chair, you wipe it off first.
It's just insulting.
For your information, I was reaching for my cell phone.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I stepped out of line.
See you later, Frasier.
Bye-bye, Roz.
This is table seven.
Could you send someone to dust my chair?
For God's sake, Niles.
I'll do it.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
Stop it.
Just sit down.
May I have one of those, please?
So, I understand you had a full dance card this weekend.
I met a lovely young artist at the gallery opening on Saturday.
We went out for coffee afterwards and our date lasted until, well, the cows didn't actually come home but I did hear mooing on the front porch.
I'm drawing a blank.
The only woman I rememberyou chatting with was the one in the Birkenstocks who went on and on about her driftwood collages.
Yes, that's Caitlin.
We seem different on the surface but once you get to know her, she is a breath of fresh air.
I haven't felt this excited about a relationship in ages.
That's wonderful, Frasier.
So, is she from around here?
- It didn't come up.
- I see.
- Where did she go to school?
- She didn't mention it.
Probably art school.
Being an artist, I'm sure she is enthusiastic about the finer things.
- Literature, music - We never got around to that.
I think I'm putting you on the spot here.
Let's just leave it at congratulations on your new relationship.
What are you implying?
I think we both know what kind of relationship we're talking about.
Would you stop saying the word "relationship" that way?
I'm not condemning you for your little fling.
Don't pass it off as something deeper.
All you have in common is the faint impression ofthe word "Sealy" on your backsides.
I wouldn't stay in a relationship ifthere was no future in it.
So ifyou had nothing in common beyond the physical, you'd break it off?
Yes, absolutely.
It's a principle of mine.
This topic comes up all the time on my show.
What do I always say?
- Surely you must listen occasionally.
- Of course.
But I'm usually busy between eleven and one.
My show is on from two to five.
- Can't wait to see his face.
- Me, too.
He doesn't have a clue.
All set.
Let's do it together.
Good boy.
That was terrific.
- I wonder if he made a wish.
- I know I did.
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
Daphne, Dad.
We don't want to miss the previews.
Come on, birthday boy.
I haven't given you your present.
I got him a brand-new, rubber eeseburger-chay.
Frasier, can we convince you to join us?
I don't think so.
Your brother's been slaving away in the kitchen.
I'm having Caitlin over for dinner.
For dinner.
And what would you be preparing for dinner?
Stop your sniggering insinuations that Caitlin and l share nothing but the physical.
There are manythings we share.
Caitlin.
Now they're sharing a Tic Tac.
Let me take your coat.
You remember Niles, of course.
And this is Daphne, Caitlin.
We'll be out ofyour way in a minute.
As soon as I can tear Mr Crane away from Eddie.
Yes, he's having a birthday party for his dog.
How old is he?
Too old to be having a birthday party for his dog.
Can I interestyou in a drink?
I've just opened a bottle of C√¥te de Brouilly.
You've been saving it.
Bourgogne hasn't made a decent Beaujolais in years.
Do you hear that, Niles?
Our Caitlin is a fellow oenophile.
When I was little, myfather owned a vineyard.
I would open a can of Hawaiian Punch and let it breathe.
And we share that same quirky sense of humour.
- Would you care for a glass?
- No.
I hate the taste ofwine.
Finally.
Something I can use to tell you two apart.
Martini?
I cut out alcohol along with processed sugar, dairy products and meat.
I hope I'm not screwing up your menu.
- What are you serving?
- Well, so far parsley and curvy orange slices.
But we'll make do.
Let me get you a glass of mineral water.
Please, help yourself to the melon slices.
Just unwind the prosciutto.
I owe you an apology.
You two are compatible.
How long before we're standing outside a wedding chapel pelting you both with whole grain brown rice?
Spare me your sarcasm.
Let me have my fun.
You're having yours.
Even ifyou deny that's what you're doing.
I would never continue if I didn't feel that there was some future in it.
And I believe there is.
Ever heard of opposites attracting?
Where I am worldly, Caitlin is unspoiled.
Rather remarkable, given her terror of preservatives.
Frasier, I just met your dad.
Did you know we're both Libras?
Which explains why I'm so perky, open-minded and quick to tears.
- And don't forget outgoing.
- No, I didn't.
Everybody coming?
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Nice to meet you, too, Caitlin.
Will you stop smirking?
It'll take more than dabbling in astrology to dim the charm ofthis young woman.
Oh, my God!
This is the coolest chair.
Just get out.
- Morning, Frasier.
- Morning, Dad.
What's the matter?
It's Caitlin.
I'm in hell.
Last night I had the most intense physical pleasure I've ever known.
Frasier, before you continue, I shared my bed last night with a dog.
That's not the problem, Dad.
It's just there's absolutely no future for me and Caitlin.
I never thought there was.
She's a flake.
That's not the point.
There are aspects of her personality that I find off-putting.
Like her being a flake.
It's just difficult to walk away from something so intoxicating.
Fras, I'm going to say one thing.
Watch out for this woman.
I know how these things work.
- You experienced something like this?
- I didn't say that.
I just know the type.
Today, she's got you going against your better judgement.
Pretty soon you'll be thinking about her all the time, Iosing sleep, missing work, neglecting yourfriends.
And then you'll get caught naked with her in the back seat ofyour squad car.
But, anyway, the point is the longeryou put this off, the harder it'll be to end it.
You're absolutely right, Dad.
Got to nip this thing in the bud.
I'll go overthere now.
Doing anything else would make me a hypocrite.
Justyesterday I dedicated an entire showto the importance of self-control.
- You did?
- Doesn't anybody listen?
- Who is it?
- It's Frasier.
Why didn't you call first?
I'm working on one of my collages.
I'm covered in paint.
I got turpentine in my hair.
I'm all sweaty.
It'll only take a moment.
I need to talk to you about something.
All right, but be nice.
Well, actually, l Good Lord, you really do look Good Lord.
- Hey, Daphne, is Frasier here?
- No, he's not back yet.
He was supposed to meet me to finish this paperwork.
Now he can just do it himself.
- Can I use our powder room?
- Yeah, of course.
Frasier's attempt to break up with Caitlin has gone awry again.
Now I've missed the wine tasting.
What kind ofweak-willed man allows a woman to come between him - and a 1981 Cheval Blanc?
- Just out of curiosity, why didn't you go by yourself instead of sitting with me for half an hour?
I was worried about him, Daphne, worried sick.
Dr Crane.
Were you at Caitlin's all this time?
Heavens, no, I stopped by early this morning.
We've decided to go our separate ways.
And then I met up with Roz, went over some paperwork.
You know how she is.
Get her on one of her troubles and yak, yak, yak.
And yet she makes every story so interesting, I could listen to her for hours.
Where have you been?
Where do you think I've been?
Trying to break up with Caitlin.
But did I do it?
No.
And why?
Because I'm Frasier and I'm a sexoholic.
It's obvious what's happening here.
You are having a purely sexual fling that happens to all of us at some time in our lives.
Where the chemistry is perfect, where you can't be alone together without tearing each other's clothes off and jumping each other.
Does this sound familiar?
Yeah.
Everyone's had a relationship like that.
I know I have.
His name was I can't tell you this.
It's too embarrassing.
We're all friends here.
I don't even remember all the details.
Take a minute.
It all started one afternoon when I was sunbathing on the roof of our building.
I was concerned about tan lines so I decided to unhook my bikini top.
I'll get it.
Mine was this lifeguard.
He had long, blond hair and the bluest eyes.
He used to get so sunburnt I'd spend hours peeling the skin off his back.
Whatwas his name?
Rick?
Nick?
I knowthere was an ick sound.
I was about to make one ofthose myself.
My mother picks the worst times to call.
Did I miss anything?
- No.
You were telling us a story.
- Yeah, that's right.
Well, once I got my top off, I started thinking to myself, I've never had an all-over tan.
So I looked to see if I was still alone.
Then I started to slip off The rolls are done.
We haven't heard anything from you, Niles.
I don't think we're exactly in Niles' wheelhouse.
I beg your pardon.
I've heard your stories.
They're not the steamiest stuff.
You've forgotten the semester I spent living in Paris.
I had a torrid affair with a married woman.
- Really?
- I had no idea.
It's not something I boast about.
The attraction was simply overpowering.
Every Thursday, two o'clock, the Hotel de Boulogne.
We'd arrive separately, climb the stairs, open the door and ooh-la-la.
What an embrace.
Afterwards, she'd whisper to me, "There's something so sweet in your eyes, and it" "does me so much good," said Emma Bovary.
If you're going to steal a love life, don't steal from the classics.
The part about being in Paris is true.
Got them out just in time.
Another minute and I would've had burnt buns.
Which brings us back to your story.
There I was wearing nothing but a smile when the sun started to shift.
So I moved behind the water tower, and who was lying there but Derrick, the good-looking fireman from across the hall who was also getting an all-over tan, I might add.
So I had two choices.
I could either tiptoe away or - Tea.
- No, sit!
Must Daphne do everything around here?
I'll get it.
I could use a glass of iced water anyway.
You're not the only one.
Let me give you a hand.
- Is any of this helping?
- Not much.
I've got to make a point here.
For as long as I've known you, you've been complaining about your lack of a sex life.
Now you have one, so why are you still complaining?
It just seems wrong.
I've thought a lot about this That's your problem.
You've thought too much about this.
Why don't you stop listening to your head and start listening to your body?
You're enjoying this.
Why do you have to feel so guilty about it?
I'm afraid I have no future with her.
So?
Maybe she thinks she has a future with me.
Then it would be wrong.
But is that how she feels?
- I don't know.
- Ask her.
If she feels the same way, just enjoy yourself.
These things don't come around very often and they don't last when they do.
You're right.
Over-thinking things can certainly spoil anything.
I gave the same advice on my show to that lawyer from Bainbridge.
- I don't remember that.
- You were five feet away.
Doesn't anyone listen?
It wasn't until afterwards that we realised we'd rolled onto the skylight above the main stairwell.
We took some ribbing about that.
Everything's under control.
Dinner should be ready in about 20 minutes.
- Smells wonderful.
- So do you.
- Caitlin, you know - Yes?
I wanted to ask you, where do you see this going?
Right now I'm heading to your earlobe but ifyou care to reroute me, I'm open to suggestions.
No, I mean our relationship.
We've never talked about it.
I don't know.
I guess I was kind of looking at this as a nice, casual thing.
- I hope that doesn't disappoint you.
- No, I'm actually relieved.
I've been loving things the way they are, too.
- We're just having some fun, right?
- Fun doesn't begin to describe it.
I wanted to make sure we were both on the same page.
Is that what's been on your mind because you've been tense.
I even got some hot oil to give you a massage.
I guess we won't be needing that now.
Well, I have been terribly worried about this global warming situation.
We've got some time before dinner.
I'll go get the oil.
- I'm so glad we had this conversation.
- Yeah, me, too.
I was starting to worry that you were scared off by my lifestyle.
- I mean, I'm pretty out there.
- Oh, Caitlin I'm not that narrow-minded.
We have a wonderful chemistry.
That's enough to offset a few minor differences.
You can be taking your shirt off.
Same goes, by the way.
I just love these converted loft spaces.
I wonder what this one was before you moved in.
Judging by these meat hooks, I'd say a slaughterhouse, huh?
No, I put those in.
It was a day-care centre.
You artists with your whimsical decorating touches.
That's a mousetrap, isn't it?
- Do you get many mice?
- I wish.
I use them in my art.
Dead mice?
They're part of my newest collage series.
It's all about mortality.
Caitlin, you've cut your hair.
Yeah, sometimes the spirit just grabs me and I've got to do it.
It's very freeing.
Plus, there's something great about using your body parts for a practical use.
Well, it's different.
It's still beautiful, nonetheless.
- Is that all your hair?
- It's mostly mine.
- I'm thinking - No, don't think.
The secret to a good massage is to let the mind rest - and listen to the body.
- Right.
Go ahead, body, I'm listening.
That feels good.
Ifwe move to the bed, I could give you a more thorough massage.
I just remembered it's a full moon tonight.
Look.
Isn't that beautiful?
How romantic.
There's nothing like a full moon to make one want to Caitlin?
I'm a member ofthe Lycanthrope Society.
- As in werewolf?
- Not literally.
It's a group ofwomen who believe the moon controls our cycles.
This is our way of paying our respects.
Besides, you've heard me howl before.
Yes, but in that context, I took it as a compliment.
Frasier, you're getting all tense again.
It's the hair pillows, isn't it?
Yes, that - Got one.
- Among other things.
I'm starting to think that maybe this isn't such a good idea.
What do you mean?
We're just so different.
I'm basically your stuffy, buttoned-down sort of guy.
You're a free-spirited, mouse-painting, moon-howling sort of girl.
Is even the most satisfying sexual relationship enough to bridge that gap?
Well, I think so.
What do you think?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Dear God.
It's a minefield out there.
Everyone's talking about a mini-series I've been watching.
Did you see the end last night when I attended a benefit last night.
I had to tape it and I have yet to see it.
Who would've thought it?
Mr PBS watching a trashy mini-series.
It's not trashy.
The intricacies of the plot are downright Dickensian.
Yeah, Angie Dickensian.
I'm having a difficult time avoiding people telling me about the ending.
Hi, Roz, did you watch last night?
- Wasn't it - Goodbye, Betty.
Hey, Dr Crane.
How was your day?
Interminable.
Is the tape in the VCR?
Yes, it's all cued up.
You've got to call me when you get to the part with Heather's baby.
- Heather had a baby?
- Sorry.
Who's the father?
No, don't tell me.
I'll put your popcorn in the microwave.
- Hey, Fras.
- Hi, Dad.
I got some bad news.
There isn't a good way to tell you something like this.
Your god-uncle died.
My god-uncle?
There's no such thing.
It's your godfather's brother.
You remember your god-uncle Charlie.
No.
I barely even remember my godfather.
He died 20 years ago.
Now his brother's dead, too.
The wake's in 20 minutes.
Much as I'd like to pay my respects, catch up with my god-cousins, and meet the god-neighbours, I have some urgent business that can't wait.
Here's your popcorn and the remote.
There, enjoy your show.
All right.
I don't even know why I'm going.
The man used to hide his glass eye in my marble bag.
I knew you remembered him.
Just give me a couple of minutes to get changed.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.
You'd be smart to leave.
Dad's dragging me to a wake for god-uncle Charlie.
The one who'd plop his eyeball into his potatoes - and say, "I'm watching what I eat"?
- Yes.
- So, is Daphne here?
- Yes, she is.
Why?
I'm asking her out on a date.
And don't give me that look.
Why shouldn't l?
She's single.
I'm single.
Are you ready?
I'm not talking about eloping.
It's just dinner.
I suppose you've thought this through.
Maybe it is time.
- Time for what?
- To put this popcorn away for later.
- Aren't you watching your programme?
- He has to take Dad to a wake.
Listen, Daphne, do you have a minute?
Something I wanted to ask you.
Nothing earth-shattering.
It's just Yes?
What's that perfume you're wearing?
Leave it to you to notice.
It's Obsession.
No, it isn't.
I was just curious.
No, I'm quite sure it's Calvin Klein's Obsession.
It's very pleasing.
I spray it on my brush and comb it through.
Silly, really.
As if anyone's going to smell my hair.
- What did she say?
- I couldn't do it.
I was about to ask, then all I could think ofwas what if she said no.
It's no surprise.
After all you've been through with Maris, you are just scared of another rejection.
I was more than scared, I was terrified.
I can't go on worshipping Daphne from afar.
It's frustrating to be in love with someone and not be able to tell her how you feel.
I'm sorry.
I just came back for the fabric softener.
I didn't mean - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- How long was she there?
- I don't know.
If I'd known, I would've said, "Shut up.
Daphne's standing there".
She heard everything.
Calm down.
It may even be for the best.
You wanted to take the next step.
The next step.
I was just hurled down the entire flight of stairs.
I can't believe this.
Did Daphne really hear me say that I'm in love I'm sorry.
I really do need that fabric softener.
You've got to talk to her.
It'll only become awkward.
You can't leave things like this.
Resolve it now.
Go.
- Daphne - Dr Crane, I didn't - I hope you don't think - No, l Go ahead.
I'm terribly sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to hear that.
No, I'm glad you heard.
It's something I've been wanting to tell you.
What took you so long?
I think it's wonderful.
- You do?
- Yes, of course I do.
You dear, sweet man, give me a hug.
So, who is she?
- Who?
- This woman you're so in love with.
You didn't hear that part, did you?
No.
So, come on, what's her name?
You can't back out now.
No, you're right.
I can't.
OK, her name just happens to be Da-Phyllis.
I've never heard that name.
Da-Phyllis.
It's a family name.
Her friends call her Phyllis.
Excuse me.
I'll get some water.
Where's Niles?
He's in the kitchen.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like that.
Did you and Niles have a little chat?
Yes.
He was a bit shy at first but then he came clean.
- I couldn't be happier.
- That is wonderful.
Let me be the first to raise a glass to to god-uncle Charlie.
As long as you're doing the laundry, the kitchen towels could use a washing.
And my oven mitts are getting a bit crunchy.
What the hell is going on?
All she heard was that I was in love with someone and when she asked who, I blurted out Phyllis.
Phyllis?
It's a neighbour I saw this morning.
She had a sesame seed stuck between her teeth.
It was the size of a blanched almond.
Maybe it was a blanched almond.
If she had Mueslix Niles, stop.
You have got to clear this up.
Well, I'm off to bring the car around for Dad.
All right now, tell me more about this Phyllis.
I'd rather not.
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Have you asked her out yet?
No.
Why not?
You said you were in love with her.
- In love with who?
- Phyllis.
- Who's Phyllis?
- A woman I met.
I've just been giving him some dating advice.
All you need to know is that women go crazy for flattery.
Doesn't matter if it's a big fat lie.
They'll still buy it.
Whatever advice Daphne's giving you, must be great because she's smart.
Thank you, Mr Crane.
So, tell me about this dream woman ofyours.
- I don't know.
- I can see you're crazy about her.
Well, all right.
She's very beautiful.
And very sweet.
And she has a smile that makes my knees weaken.
Dr Crane, if this woman is as wonderful as you say she is, then you shouldn't waste another moment.
She won't be on the market forever.
You're right.
I've been a fool to hesitate.
- That's the spirit.
- I'm going to do it.
Don't leave time for second thoughts.
Ask her out this instant.
- That won't be necessary.
- It's quite nasty out.
No, I don't have to leave this room to ask Phyllis on a date.
- You don't?
- No.
Because, you see, Daphne I know her work number by heart.
Well, then.
- Look at me.
My heart's racing.
- Mine, too.
Phyllis, hello.
Niles Crane.
How are you?
I was wondering if you would want to have dinner with me sometime.
You would?
How about tonight at my place?
Eight o'clock sounds great.
What would you do if you were me?
Would you tell her everything and just let the chips fall where they may or Yeah.
Well, I do see your point.
I have to run.
I'll take the three-year subscription and travel clock.
- Daphne.
- Hello.
I was out doing some shopping and I thought you might need some dessert for your dinner with Phyllis.
Well, I was just doing some last-minute tidying up forthat.
And I suppose you've got about eight things cooking.
So I'll get out ofyourway.
Soon as I pop this in the fridge.
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll do it.
Dr Crane, there's barely enough pasta here for one person.
Is this your idea of a romantic dinner?
Thank heavens I stopped by.
I can whip up a salad.
I'll stick this roast in the microwave to defrost.
- Where's your cooking sherry?
- I am under-prepared for this.
I'll call Phyllis and put her off.
You're not backing out ofthis now.
Look, don't worry.
I'll fix this place right up for a nice, intimate evening.
Candles, some soft music.
Those things always put me in a romantic mood.
I suppose it would be rude to cancel.
Now hurry up and get ready.
And wear that blue blazer ofyours.
No woman can resist you in that.
Look at the time.
Honestly, Dr Crane, sometimes I wonder what kind of a fantasy world you live in.
Now go on.
- Don't you look handsome.
- Thank you.
Daphne, this place looks wonderful.
Excellent music.
I love this aria.
Yes, she has a gorgeous voice.
Pity she never got the recognition of a Joan Sutherland or a Renata Tebaldi.
I had no idea you knew so much about sopranos.
You don't live with your brother and not learn a thing or two about divas.
The roast is coming along nicely.
- How are you at chopping vegetables?
- Are you kidding?
You don't get forearms like these from just conducting your stereo.
I'm very excited for you.
I just love first dates.
I don't see why.
They're always so awkward.
Yeah, but once in a while, when the chemistry's just right, they can be magical.
The "me toos" as you realise all you have in common, the electricity of that first accidental touch, soon you're saying the silliest things.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
You touched me, now we have to get married.
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.
Now I was thinking for the salad some cucumbers and carrots.
- How about some celery?
- No celery.
I hate it.
Me, too.
Why do you have it then?
Habit.
Maris used to like to have it around in case she felt like bingeing.
When I was little, I actually thought celery was the meanest vegetable.
Radishes were the smartest, beets were the policemen.
What sort of personality do carrots have?
I try not to think about that when I'm chopping them.
You hear that?
We're chopping in rhythm.
We are, aren'twe?
Damn, who could that be?
It's Phyllis.
Well, go on.
Go let her in.
Go away, who's ever at the door, go away, don't come back no more.
I thought you were at a wake.
We left.
Even the mourners were babbling about the mini-series.
I'm sure you're in a rush to watch the rest of it.
No, everybody's going to the Kiwanis Club for a post-wake kegger.
Could you take Dad?
Me?
Well, they're your god-family.
- I thought you were Phyllis.
- Phyllis?
She's due any moment.
I'll be leaving as soon as the roast is done.
Daphne is cooking dinner for your date with a fictitious woman.
Why not just set a place for the March Hare and the Mad Hatter?
I didn't plan forthis, butwe are having a perfect evening.
I need a few more minutes alone and I'll be able to tell her everything.
Niles, this absurd lie is likely to blow up in yourface.
As long as I keep track ofwhat I'm saying, nothing is going to blow up on anyone.
Phyllis!
Ka-boom.
Some ofyour mail wound up in my box today.
- Aren't you considerate?
- Hello.
- I'm Frasier, Niles' brother.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- As a matter of fact - Hello.
You must be Phyllis.
Yes.
Do I know you?
I'm Daphne.
I'm just a friend.
Make yourself comfortable.
We were starting to worry.
- Excuse me?
- Can I get you a glass ofwine?
- All right.
I came by to drop off - I'll be back in a snap.
That woman seemed to think that you were expecting me.
I've been getting to know my neighbours and I guess you didn't get the invitation.
No.
It's dumb luck I stopped by tonight.
Here we are.
Now the appetisers are almost ready and it won't be much longer until the roast is done.
I hope you're hungry.
- The invitation was for dinner?
- Yes, but we'll do it another time.
I'd love to stay.
- Hey, Niles.
Frasier, you coming?
- In a minute, Dad.
- Daph, what are you doing here?
- Helping Dr Crane with his dinner.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
Marty Crane.
- Hi, I'm Phyllis Conrad.
- You're Phyllis, huh?
- Don't worry.
We'll be going soon.
Dr Crane's eager to have you all to himself.
- Really?
- He's been going on about you all week.
How pretty you are.
How nice you dress.
Dad, you don't want to be late.
- I've embarrassed him.
He's blushing.
- He's not the only one.
Excuse me, Phyllis.
Frasier, could l - Help me get rid of her.
- I've got my hands full with Dad.
You never had any idea he had his eye on you?
I caught him staring at me in the elevatorthis morning.
Now I knowwhy.
Dr Crane, would you give me a hand?
Frasier?
Dad, I guess it's time we were going.
Maybe you could go press for the elevator.
All right.
Very nice meeting you, Phyllis.
Well, your brother certainly kept his feelings to himself until tonight.
Yes, well, he's always been the quiet type.
Especially since all the trouble with Heather.
Heather?
The pie should be heated and there's cream to put on the strawberries.
Or anything else, should the night take that turn.
- His wife was poisoned?
- He stood trial.
They never proved it.
Crab puffs?
No, thank you.
I just remembered, there is someplace that I have to be.
Thank you very much for the wine.
Oh, my God, I drank the wine.
- What did you tell her?
- I'll explain later, Niles.
But don't plan on running for the co-op board here anytime soon.
- Where did Phyllis go?
- She left.
She said she wasn't feeling well.
Hope you don't mind my saying so.
You almost seem relieved that she's gone.
Relieved?
Well, Daphne, to tell you the truth, I am relieved.
I knew it.
This is all my fault.
It's as clear as day now.
You're just not ready for a relationship - and there I was pushing you into it.
- Daphne I could see how uncomfortable you were.
She must have picked up on that, too, and that's why she left.
- What was I thinking?
- This is not your fault.
Yes, but I should've seen.
You're on the rebound.
You're still vulnerable.
That's probably why you had so much trouble asking for a simple date.
Yes, I suppose you're right.
I'm so sorry, Dr Crane.
I guess you just need to take some more time.
Ifyou rush things, you may ruin something that has a real chance.
No smart woman would get involved with a man in the middle of a divorce.
I know I never would.
Well, thank you, Daphne.
This has all been very helpful.
And thank you for everything you did tonight, even if it didn'twork out exactly as I'd hoped.
What are friends for?
I suppose we should start clearing all this up.
Actually, Daphne, would you like to stay and have dinner with me?
- You mean that?
- Yes.
Well, yes, that would be lovely.
Wonderful.
May I pour you some wine?
You know, although it seems hopeless right now, I have a feeling that before very long, you'll be sitting down to a romantic dinner with the woman ofyour dreams.
I thinkyou may just be right.
Shall we?
Thankyou.
Here's to us.
That's very nice.
This is the most spectacular wine I've ever tasted.
I'm glad you like it.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
-Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, listen to this.
"Michael Hawkins of Allentown, Pennsylvania, has donated his right lung to his younger brother, Clovis".
"Says Hawkins, 'l got two lungs, but I only got one brother'".
Isn't that something?
The love one brother feels for the other.
What do you want?
I need you to come to a dog show with me.
I would rather give you a lung.
- Latte, please.
- Frasier, I beg you.
It's at the Seattle Kennel Club tomorrow night and Maris will be there.
In what class will Maris be showing?
She'll be showing no class.
As she has ever since she hooked up with Dr Schenkman.
It's my first time seeing them since we filed for divorce.
Here's an idea, Niles.
Don't go.
If I don't go people will think I've let Maris and Schenkman intimidate me.
I want to prove that I'm strong and independent and I can't do that alone.
All right.
If it's moral support you need, I'll go with you.
I'll pick you up around eight.
And I have a patient.
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.
Some things never change.
Do you know where I can get a cheap hotel room?
Case in point.
Goodbye, Roz.
Why do you need a hotel room?
They're still painting my new place.
I can't be around those fumes.
And they've rented my old apartment.
Grande decaf latte, please.
I am on the street.
You ordered a $4 cup of coffee.
"On the street" may be a tad dramatic.
I've got to call around, see if I can find something.
Dad is going to San Francisco for the weekend.
You could always stay with me.
That would sure make things easier.
OK.
Well, then, that's settled.
That's that, then.
You didn't really expect me to take you up on it.
No.
I wouldn't have offered if it wasn't something I wanted to do.
- All right.
- Here you go.
And there's your check.
- I'll get that.
- No, let me get that.
OK, thanks.
Lucky me.
I'm getting everything I want today.
- It's about time.
- Calm down, Dad.
I was getting worried.
My plane leaves at five o'clock.
- Your blood pressure medicine.
- I don't need it.
Pack it anyway!
What's this?
Earrings?
I picked them up for Daphne at the drug store.
She ran some errands for me.
- Nice.
Are they sapphires?
- Yes.
I always buy precious stones at the same counter where I pick up corn pads and Wart-Be-Gone.
- Shouldn't you be going?
- There's something I want to give you.
A token of my appreciation.
- Dr Crane, you remembered.
- Of course I did.
Can you believe it was five years ago today that I came to work here?
I knew you wouldn't let an important occasion like this go by unnoticed.
- But I wasn't expecting a gift.
- Well, it's a tiny gift.
Oh, my God!
Sapphires.
- Actually, Daphne - These must have cost a fortune.
My friend Molly got a diamond bracelet from her boss but she worked for him for ten years and she was sleeping with him.
I got sapphires and I didn't even have to sleep with you.
Although now that I've got the sapphires What am I saying?
Is it rude if I go and try these on?
I have to see what they look like.
I've never had real jewellery.
I'm speechless.
Dear God, she believes they're genuine sapphires.
- You think?
- I'll have to tell her the truth.
Why?
Didn'tyou see how happy she was?
I can't let herthink I gave her something I didn't.
Honesty between friends is far more precious than any gem.
I feel like a princess.
I'm never going to take them off.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You even remembered that sapphires are my birthstone.
- There's no end to your thoughtfulness.
- Somebody has to keep track.
- I should be getting to the airport.
- I'll get my keys.
No, absolutely not.
I'll drive Mr Crane.
You're not lifting a finger.
You ring for the elevator, I'll grab me coat.
My flight's at five.
They told me to get there an hour early.
- Did you pack your medicine?
- Yes, but I told you, I don't need it.
- Hey, guys.
- Frasier, help her with that stuff.
- Thanks for letting me use your room.
- No problem.
So you're off to San Francisco?
Duke and l took our shore leave there in '52.
- Going to re-trace our steps.
- Sure sounds like fun.
We had a great time.
No place like 'Frisco for a guy cruising the streets Iooking for a good time.
You know, Dad, I think you'll find that 'Frisco hasn't changed all that much.
Well, I hope not.
Bye.
Hey, Roz.
Just off to the airport.
Back in a bit.
See you later.
Come in.
You're earlier than I expected.
I had to get out sooner than I thought.
I left you a message.
I didn't check my machine all day today.
Thank you so much for this.
You won't even know I'm here.
You have 13 messages.
I had my calls forwarded.
I hope you don't mind.
Hey, Roz, it's Marco.
I'm coming to town.
Are you busy Saturday night Iate?
Call me.
Obviously Marco and I haven't talked for a long time.
Something tells me you never talked for a long time.
Roz?
This is Paula Garrett, Rick's mom.
We just found out about the baby, and we think it's important to meet you.
We're seeing Rick in Paris day after tomorrow, so any time before then would be fine.
I'm running out now.
Maybe I'll try you later.
Oh, my God.
What do they want?
They want to meet you.
They are your child's grandparents.
I worked this out with Rick.
He's 20 years old, still in college and it's best if I raise this baby by myself.
I've got to put up with in-laws and I don't even have a husband.
That's like posing nude for your art teacher and still flunking the course.
Shut up, I needed the credit.
- All they want is a short meeting.
- That's what they say now.
What ifthey want another one after that?
What if they don't think I'm a fit mother?
What if they're nice, supportive people?
I just don't want to do this, Frasier.
It's not comfortable.
Roz I could go with you ifyou like.
Better yet, we could have them here tomorrow night.
Niles and I have that dog show at eight.
They could come before that.
I don't know.
- I'll be that's Mrs Garrett.
- I'm not here.
Hello?
Yes, she is.
Yes, she did get your message.
No, I'm afraid she won't be able to meet you.
Yes, I understand that you're upset.
I'm terribly sorry.
Goodbye.
Thank you, Frasier.
Thank you.
That was Marco.
Now we're calling Mrs Garrett.
All right, give it to me straight.
How do I look?
Like Pollyanna grew up and got herself in a little trouble.
Why am I doing this?
How did I let you talk me into this?
It will mean a lot to them.
You can learn about your baby's lineage.
A lot ofthings are inherited, you know, like intelligence, artistic ability - I've got to check my make-up.
- Roz, this should be fun.
It's like a little preview ofwho your child might be.
Hi, there.
Steve Garrett.
- My wife's just Honey?
- It was nice seeing you, too.
What a coincidence.
Your neighbour goes to my hair salon.
Hi, I'm Paula.
Frasier Crane.
Won't you please come in?
Roz will be out in a second.
She just went to powder her self.
We hope this isn't too awkward for her.
She sounded anxious on the phone.
Who could blame her?
She doesn't know what kind of people we are.
A situation like this is enough to make anyone a little nervous.
Roz isn't the nervous type.
Roz?
This is Steve and Paula Garrett.
We don't blame you for being shocked.
We're used to it.
You should see the looks we get.
You were taken aback, weren't you, Dr Crane?
- Certainly not.
- Everyone comments on it.
I must admit when I opened the door l Couldn't believe we were old enough to have a 20-year-old son.
Exactly.
You know, you both look so young, don't they, Roz?
Yes, young.
Very, very young.
Roz, you're uncomfortable but we have no intention of intruding on your life.
Rick told us how wonderful you are.
We just wanted to offer any help or support you think is appropriate.
Thanks.
That's very nice.
I thought your guests might be a little peckish.
Daphne Moon, Steve and Paula Garrett.
Hello, l I know, it's amazing.
They are the parents of a 20-year-old.
Amazing.
Excuse me.
Niles, you're early.
I thought you might want to grab a bite to eat before the dog show.
I'm sorry, I didn't realise that you had Company.
Steve and Paula Garrett, this is my brother Niles Crane.
The Garretts are the grandparents-to-be of Roz's baby.
- Nice to meet you.
- Did I hear you mention a dog show?
The Seattle Kennel Club is having its annual event.
Steve and I went to that a few years ago.
We have two giant Schnauzers.
My goodness, Paula, look at the view.
Roz, show the Garretts the view.
That would be nice.
I could use a breath of fresh air.
Just stop it, the two ofyou.
You're acting like a couple of two-year-olds.
- I'm home.
- Dad.
What are you doing here?
'Frisco was a bust.
All our watering holes are gone.
The steakhouse was a sushi bar.
And Duke and I went out for a walk.
We passed City Hall and there's this big crowd, like a pep rally or something.
So we joined them.
Some official guy says something that we didn't hear.
Then everybody's throwing rice and all the men are kissing each other and all the women are kissing each other and I'm not sure, but I think Duke and I may be married.
The whole weekend was like that.
Just one surprising event - I'm sorry.
Did we startle you?
- No, I didn't know we had company.
Dad, this is Steve and Paula Garrett.
They're Rick's parents.
Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Marty Crane.
They're just on their way to Paris to visit Rick.
That sounds like fun.
I'm just a little nervous.
I hear the Parisians can be kind of snooty.
Excuse me.
I've got something in the oven.
- Let me help you.
- Yeah, me, too.
We've got to stop.
They'll hear us.
- Mmm, what's that I smell?
- Probably Japan.
What is the matter with you people?
Don't say you don't think this is funny?
They are two perfectly nice people who happen to have large noses.
Sniggering like school children.
Ifyou can't get yourself under control, you can just stay in here.
- Quiche Lorraine, anyone?
- Quiche her?
I hardly know her.
- That smells wonderful.
- Does it ever.
Is this homemade or store-bought?
Honey, don't ask that.
Pardon my wife.
Sometimes she gets a little nosy.
Me nosy?
You're the nosy one in the family.
Anyone who knows you knows you're nosy.
Anyone who knows you knows you're nosier.
Something wrong, Fras?
Quiche her, I hardly know her.
I just got that.
In spite of a shaky beginning, this evening's turned out rather well.
Yeah.
And you were absolutely right, Frasier.
Now I can see some ofthe qualities my baby can have.
A great sense of humour and a sweet disposition, a nose like an anteater.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
Rick had a fine nose.
And so do you.
I'm sure your baby will have one, too.
You're right.
If Rick can beat those genes, my baby has a chance.
How long have you been working for Dr Crane?
Five years yesterday.
He gave me a beautiful pair of sapphire earrings - to mark the occasion.
- Frasier gave you sapphires?
- Who's for coffee?
- I'll take some.
You must show those earrings to Steve.
He's a jeweller.
He could probably even tell you what mine the stones came from.
Maybe coffee's a bad idea.
You've got that early flight.
Daphne, could you take this back in the kitchen?
One of me earrings must have fallen off.
- We'll help you find it.
- What does it look like?
Once you've seen one sapphire, you've seen them all.
That's not true.
They vary widely in quality.
Why don't you just get up and we have to get going.
We have plenty in here to form a search party.
- We'll just trample each other.
- We do have a big day tomorrow.
You might as well get a little sleep before you take off.
I might be able to replace the earring.
Let me see the other one.
I found it.
Here it is.
I knew I would.
Bon voyage.
- Dr Crane - No, Daphne, just a second.
It was wonderful of you to come.
Thank you for having us.
Roz, it was great meeting you.
- Our door is always open.
- Have a great trip.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Can I have it then?
I'm sorry, it was just a piece of lint.
Well, the search continues.
The one precious thing anyone's ever bought me in my whole stinking life - and I lose it.
- Daphne, I found it.
Dr Crane, I could kiss you.
OK.
- What's this?
- Nothing.
The setting's come loose.
It's only blue on top.
The bottom's all coppery.
Dr Crane.
I know what you're thinking, and you are right.
Obviously, l You've been swindled.
Where did you buy these?
I want to take these back and tell that lying cheat exactly what I think of him.
- Actually, you just did.
- You knew?
- Niles, how about a cup of coffee?
- Thanks, Roz.
Cream and sugar.
I'm terribly sorry, Daphne.
I actually meant to tell you eventually.
You didn't need to.
Her earlobe's turning green.
Daphne, the truth is I didn't remember your anniversary.
I saw them and I thought they were pretty.
So I bought them for you and you thought theywere genuine.
You seemed so happy, l They are pretty.
I suppose I can have them repaired.
I'll just take them back to the jewellery store.
Actually, I bought them at Raymond's.
Raymond's Drug Store?
The good news is they'll probably carry something for that ear infection.
I almost forgot.
Roz, I brought you something.
I thought you might get a kick out of these pictures of Ricky as a boy.
Thank you.
That is so nice ofyou.
- Where is he?
I don't see him.
- There, in the middle.
- He looks so different.
- That was before his hockey accident.
The nose job changed his whole face.
The doctor did a good job, but that's the Ricky you'll see in the baby.
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome.
And bye again.
- Take care now.
Good to see you.
- Thanks.
Oh, my God!
Come on, Roz.
It can't be that bad.
Let me see.
- No, I'll never hear the end of it.
- Please.
Where is the end of it?
Roz, you're not still looking at that picture, are you?
No, this is a different one.
Look at the way the ears on this poor little girl stick out.
It's me.
Age nine.
The year before I got them fixed.
Sorry, Roz.
I didn't recognise you with those glasses.
- Why is one side blacked out?
- I had a lazy eye.
I got that fixed the next year.
Let's just say for birthdays, I wasn't asking for ponies.
You poor thing.
What if my kid gets Rick's nose and my ears and eyes?
With my grandfather's third nipple, I might as well pitch a tent and charge admission.
Nothing like that's going to happen.
I just hate the idea of my kid being teased.
I know what that's like.
As long as my baby's in here, I can protect it.
But pretty soon this kid's going to be out there on his own.
Every child goes through a bit of teasing.
It's part of growing up.
At least yours will have a mother who understands what it feels like.
And you'll know what to say to make it better.
I really hadn't thought of it that way.
I'm good at finding the positive in things.
Look at what happened to me tonight.
I could say I worked for someone for five years and he forgot my anniversary and bought me a worthless piece of blue glass.
But I'd rather say he gave me a nice pair of earrings just because he thought I'd like them.
Which is sweet when you think about it.
- Frasier will be relieved to hear that.
- I'm not going to tell him.
- I'm ready for bed.
- Yeah, me, too.
Thanks again, Daphne.
You're welcome.
I just felt a big kick.
You sure it wasn't a sneeze?
It's the last one.
I promise.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Geez, look at this stuff.
Golden Sunset Retirement Village.
Investments for Seniors.
Willowbrook Mortuary.
What the hell kind of list am I on?
The good news is I don't think it's the kind of list they keep you on very long.
Ever since I turned 65, all I get is geezer mail.
It's very depressing.
The only thing depressing about being a geezer is looking like one.
There's things a person can do to look younger.
- How he dresses - I tried those Jordache jeans.
I just think you ought to leave something to the imagination.
There's always your hair.
I know it's not exactly your style, but there's nothing wrong with covering up that grey.
I know just the right shade for you.
Cinnamon sable.
Cinnamon sable?
Sounds nice.
Wait, I couldn't use that.
That's Duke's shade.
He'd scratch my eyes out.
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, prepare to salivate.
If that is a picture ofyour new Biedermeier loveseat, you've already shown it to me.
This is a photo of my latest purchase.
An exquisite 18th century Turkish prayer rug.
Paid a fortune for it, but legend says whatever you pray for on this rug will come to you.
It certainly worked for the dealer.
I'm sorry, Niles, I'm just not in the best of moods.
I had another disastrous blind date today.
I'm sorry.
Murderers on Death Row can find women to marry them.
I can't find one to sit through coffee with me.
It's easy for them to attract women.
They have all that time to work out in the yard.
I'm serious.
I'm getting desperate here.
My love life's not much better than yours, but you don't see me going off the deep end.
Did it ever occur to you that this recent antique buying binge is nothing but a way of sublimating your frustrated sexual desires?
These purchases have nothing to do with sex.
Don't they?
In addition to the loveseat, let's see, your most recent acquisitions have been a French bedwarmer, a pair of toby jugs, the less said about that Civil War ramrod, the better.
You Freudians.
Sometimes a ramrod is just a Hell, even I can't make that one fly.
Take heart.
We're both in the same boat.
But where do you go to meet people?
Just yesterday I met a very nice man at the grocery.
He asked me if I was free Saturday night.
He said, "Wait, that's me niece's Bat Mitzvah".
I said I've never been to a Bat Mitzvah.
He asked me to go to the Bat Mitzvah.
I said I'd love to go to the Bat Mitzvah.
So - Daphne?
- Yes?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
I seem to have lost me train of thought.
Anyone like some tea?
- Love some.
Thank you.
- Thank you, yes.
Little trick I discovered a few weeks ago.
It's a lifesaver.
Anyway, as I was saying, where does one go to meet available women?
There are singles bars, of course.
- We could join a health club.
- There's a splendid idea.
I can just picture the two of us, tank tops and spandex.
With matching headbands, we might as well sterilise ourselves.
Sounds like fun, Daph.
If she says Bat Mitzvah one more time - Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.
You come up with an idea.
- What are you guys talking about?
- Our pathetic love lives.
Why don't you do what my buddies and I did when we were hard up for dates?
Invade Korea?
No, we'd throw a party with just one rule.
Only single, available people were invited.
I don't know, Dad.
That doesn't really sound like us.
It works.
I used to throw one a month.
People used to call them Marty parties.
People would call me and say, "Marty, when's the next Marty party"?
"lsn't it time for another Marty party"?
"Had a great time at the last one".
- Dad?
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Or somebody might say, "Can I host the next Marty party"?
Doesn't always work.
I don't think we're quite hard up enough yet - to stage a singles party.
- OK, suit yourself.
We'll just get ready for the evening.
I'll dish out the spaghetti and you guys set up the card table.
I got us a new jigsaw puzzle.
It's called "The Wheat Field".
- I'll send the invitations.
- I'll call the caterer.
Hello, welcome.
Please come in.
This is wonderful.
I had no idea we'd get such a turnout.
Everywhere I look there's another woman I want to get to know better.
With some obvious exceptions.
- Roz, I didn't know you were coming.
- I know it's a long shot but I figured I better get out and do a little flirting or I'd forget how.
- Can I offer you something?
- Yeah Roz, you are rusty.
I know you've been striking out lately, but I invited someone who'll improve your batting average.
I've already met someone captivating.
- Hi, Roz.
- Tina, you made it.
You know me.
Have I ever said no to a good time?
That's what I was trying to tell Frasier.
Tina Kramer, meet Dr Frasier Crane.
- Doctor, huh?
- Yes, that's right.
Roz?
Strong hands.
I guess it's true what they say, strong hands, strong mind.
That's why you'll never see an unopened pickle jar at a Mensa meeting.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Oh, excuse me.
Martin?
- You're looking at my hair, right?
- Yeah.
Looks great.
Thanks.
Yeah, I did it myself.
- Get out.
- Yeah, really.
Well, Daphne suggested it.
And at first I said no way, but then I thought a lot of other guys do it.
What better place to try it than here where nobody knows who I am.
You look great, too.
I was really happy with this dress.
You can't tell I'm pregnant.
I know.
Real nice.
You have a good time at the party and the dress looks great.
Nobody'd know.
Same with your hair.
It's completely natural.
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.
Watch that "Dad" business.
Got a few ladies around here thinking I just might be your brother.
Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.
- Aren't you having fun?
- Sort of.
It's been so long since I've been single it's hard to strike up conversations.
You just need a little confidence.
Watch this.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
I'm Marty Crane.
And this is my son, Niles.
Yep, my son.
Hi, Vicky Cantrell.
You're the host.
I was admiring your beautiful Turkish rug.
- Thank you.
- Is that 18th century?
Yes, it is.
You have quite an eye.
I work for an auction house.
I'd love to see some ofyour other pieces.
It would be my pleasure.
There's an absurd old legend about that rug, that whatever you pray for Well, perhaps it's not that absurd after all.
Roz, that woman is all over me.
Didn't you get what I was trying to tell you?
Yes.
I also got it when she showed me how she can tie a knot - in a cherry stem with her tongue.
- That's a party trick.
The cherry was in my mouth at the time.
I tried to tell you that I met a woman tonight.
- All right, I'll go talk to her.
- Thank you.
- Frasier.
- Niles.
I just met the most fabulous woman.
That's fabulous.
I also met someone who's terrific.
Wait, I can't wait.
I have to show you mine first.
- She's over by the buffet.
- So is mine.
At what point would you like to acknowledge that we're both waving at the same woman?
I saw her first.
You're the host.
You see everyone first.
- There are plenty of other women here.
- Exactly.
So go pick one.
Let's stop this.
The civilised thing to do is for us to both stay away from her.
We are psychiatrists, not a couple of rutting pigs in a barnyard.
What do you say to that?
Sooey.
- Very well.
May the better man win.
- Fine.
- Frasier, your father wants you.
- Advantage Niles.
I want you to meet a big fan of yours.
Kathy Locker, Dr Frasier Crane.
I love your show.
You're such a good listener.
Just yesterday you gave the best advice to that woman who called in about a problem with her teenage son.
What was it you said?
What do I ever say?
You're in denial.
Seek help.
Whatever.
Blah, blah, blah.
- He's different from what I expected.
- He's not what I expected either, but you get used to it.
You were telling me about being a detective.
Do you feel like getting a drink?
- That would be nice, Marty.
- OK.
You know, this is such a prime spot here.
maybe one of us should stay here and the other one get the drinks.
You're right.
So I'll have a beer.
OK.
I think I lost an earring.
There it is, by my foot.
There you go.
Thanks.
Enjoy the party.
- These egg rolls are delicious.
- I made them myself.
Really?
A psychiatrist and a chef.
Impressive.
They both came in handy when I cured the ham.
Hello, Niles.
There's an emergency in the kitchen.
Very cagey, Frasier.
Why don't you just run out and yell "fire"?
- Excuse me, Vicky, for a moment.
- Of course.
- Is it a serious problem?
- No, he's always run like that.
You mean the kitchen.
He can handle it.
- You two seem very close.
- Yes.
I'm his best friend.
Well, his only friend, really.
That surprises me.
He seems very outgoing.
Doesn't he, though?
Yes, the medication seems to be working wonders.
I just hope he sticks with it this time.
Shall we hit the buffet?
- What a great story.
- Thanks.
This is fun.
I usually hate these kinds of parties.
Me, too.
People are always so superficial.
Yeah, it seems like everybody nowadays is all about appearances.
- Shall we get a drink?
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm not really very thirsty.
- Me, either.
Then I top it offwith brandied cherries and cr√®me fra√Æche.
Frasier.
I'm telling Vicky my recipe for cr√©pe g√¢teau.
I'm sure she's had enough ofyour cr√©pe by now.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Dad needs you, Frasier.
- No, he doesn't.
- I think he might.
All right, then.
Ifyou will excuse me.
Do you live with your father?
No.
A grown man live with his father?
Frasier lives with Dad.
Champagne?
Get me home.
Something's happening with my hair dye.
It's melting.
Look at this stain.
It must look terrible.
No, it looks terrific.
Maybe the fire is making you perspire a bit.
Here.
You look quite young and attractive.
Yes, by the warmth ofthe fire glow, I'd say that you actually look like you're back in your "Marty party" days.
You're not BS-ing me?
OK, then, I'll stay.
- Vicky, hello.
Where's Niles?
- He had to take a call.
That's terrific.
Would you like to find someplace where we could talk?
No interruptions.
- Frasier - Not now, Roz.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- My water just broke.
Maybe you sat in something.
Oh, my God!
What's all over my Turkish prayer rug?
- You've got to get me to a hospital.
- Yes, of course.
Vicky, ifyou'll excuse us, my friend Roz just went into labour.
- How exciting!
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Wait one second.
This may not be an appropriate moment but perhaps you'd like to have dinner with me sometime?
That's sweet ofyou, but I'm not really interested.
Thank you for your honesty.
What is wrong with me?
Why can't I find a woman who's interested in me?
Those are two different questions so we should talk them both over.
Wait, I can't.
Because I'm in labour!
How did we do?
This time it's hot and it's got cream.
Of course, it's still chicken soup.
Who needs coffee when we can keep alert by perusing these very up-to-date magazines?
Look, Dad.
That cute Tricia Nixon's getting married.
Excuse me, may we get an update on Roz Doyle?
Sure.
She is still in early labour.
Hang in there.
She's pretty.
I should make a play for her.
Considering how young and attractive I am tonight.
I said I was sorry.
Not half as sorry as when I ran over that speed bump and you left a headprint on the ceiling of my BMW.
Hello.
Niles, didn't expect to see you here.
The doorman found Roz's purse in the lobby.
I thought she might need it.
I suppose you also came to gloat.
You got Vicky, I didn't.
Neither of us got Vicky.
She went home with the bartender.
Really?
Well, you know what I say?
Her loss.
Absolutely right.
Her loss.
Has saying that ever made you feel any better?
Not a whit.
It's been a hell of a night for all of us.
It certainly was for me.
I lost Vicky, my rug is ruined, someone left weird brown stains on my wing chair.
Hello.
I came down as soon as I heard.
What the hell happened to your hair?
I coloured it just like you told me to.
This isn't cinnamon sable.
I couldn't use that.
It had a woman's picture on the box.
I used some stuff called Color In A Can.
It said just spray on and go.
- How did I know it was a lousy product?
- If only there had been some clue.
Don't you start on me.
You had me melting by that fire.
Wait a minute.
You're the one who left stains on my wing chair.
I was wondering when you'd crack that, Miss Marple.
Don't start with me.
Stop it!
What is wrong with you?
Our friend is having a baby in there.
We've all had dreadful evenings but we should be thinking about Roz.
Exactly.
Besides, nobody could have had as horrendous an evening as I did.
I got stood up at a Bat Mitzvah.
I waited there an hour.
He left a lame excuse on the machine, but if he thinks he's got another chance with me, he's meshuggah.
Oh, boo hoo, anyway.
At least you had a date tonight.
And at least your apartment wasn't decimated.
I went to a party tonight with shoe polish on my hair.
That's it.
Breathe.
You're doing great.
Take care, honey.
Good luck.
We love you.
She's very tired, so I'll have to ask you to make it quick.
Roz, congratulations.
Look at her.
She is beautiful.
Mazel tov.
It's a long story.
So, what's her name?
Alice.
Alice May Doyle.
My daughter.
My God, that's the first time I ever said that.
You look great.
How do you feel?
Fine.
I'm just a little tired.
Maybe we should go.
I'll drop by and see you tomorrow.
I sure would love to hold her for just a second.
Maybe we should just wait until you're not dripping toxins.
We'll see you, then.
OK.
Bye.
- Congratulations.
- I'll be along in a second.
Roz, congratulations again.
I'm so proud of you.
Your little girl is just perfect.
She is, isn't she?
- My God, look at your face.
- I must look real lovely.
Yes, that's exactly how you look.
Lovely.
I don't think I've ever seen a face more purely happy than right now.
Little Alice, how I wish you could wake up right now and see how beautiful your mother looks.
Then again, you need your rest.
You did great, honey.
Sleep well.
- Well, hello.
- Hi.
This may be an odd time to ask you this but I was convinced that we sort of made some eye contact in the waiting room.
I was wondering if I could get your number?
- But what about your?
- Forget about her.
She's asleep.
What kind of monster are you?
Her loss.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Tricia, I am so very sorry.
Have you been waiting long?
We were supposed to meet at noon, and it's now quarter to one.
The most extraordinary thing happened.
At least I'll get a colourful anecdote out ofthis.
- My watch stopped.
- I've got to go.
That is extraordinary.
It's a Swiss timepiece.
It only loses a minute per decade.
And you've had it for what, 450 years?
I have an appointment at one.
Please, let me have another chance.
I'd love to get to know you better.
I suppose even Swiss watches sometimes stop.
You'd be amazed how much fondue gets overcooked that way.
How about lunch tomorrow at Le Petit Bistro?
He'll give us the best table in the house.
Please?
OK.
I'll meet you there at one.
- That's when the little hand is - Yes, I know.
- See you then.
- OK.
Frasier.
Thank God you have room.
I just spent ten stupefying minutes sharing a table with a taxidermist.
He doesn't have to stuff his trophies.
He can just bore them stiff.
Who was that woman?
A young lady I met at the opera last night.
It was remarkable.
Our hands touched, there was a spark.
After ten minutes, I knew I had to know her better.
- Ever experience that sort of thing?
- I do know a thing or two about it.
Excuse me.
Can I have the non-fat cappuccino, please?
What am I to deduce, that you've recently gotten lucky?
Yes, and she lives in your building.
Five floors down.
Allison Landis.
You sneak.
I don't even know the woman.
How did you two meet?
On the elevator.
I walked her to her car where she'd locked her keys inside.
- I saved the day.
- You got them out with a coat hanger?
I called the auto club.
Where would I find a coat hanger?
She invited me for lunch, we hit it off.
The next night I took her to dinner.
One thing led to another and soon there was no further need for words.
Except for your frantically-babbled "thank yous".
I'm seeing her tonight, so you'll understand if I'm drained tomorrow at our squash game.
My love-making can get athletic.
More than can be said for your squash game.
I've been away from the seduction scene so long I was worried I'd lost my technique.
Were those fears ever groundless.
It's like French.
You can go without speaking it for years and then a few hours on the boulevard d'amour, then you - Where are you going?
- To sit with the taxidermist.
I can't believe this has happened twice.
- You had car trouble.
- Maybe she's still at Le Petit Bistro.
She isn't.
Ifyou're talking about someone named Tricia, she called to say she was leaving.
She said you were right about the table.
Itwas a beautiful table and she wished you were laid out dead on top of it.
It's her machine.
Hello, Tricia, it's Frasier.
I'm terribly sorry but my car battery went dead at a light and I didn't have my cell phone.
I couldn't go to the restaurant because I was wearing ridiculous shorts.
I know how this sounds but it's the truth.
Here, ask my brother.
They're ridiculous shorts.
Anyway, please give me one more chance.
I'll go anywhere, anytime.
Just give me a call.
Please.
May I have the phone?
I had such high hopes for this young woman.
Now I've gone and blown it twice.
Whom are you calling?
Allison.
It's been hours since we spoke.
Hello, there.
How are you feeling?
Me, too.
Yeah, me too Take it in my bedroom.
You're making the dog twitch.
You'll be so excited when you hear what I got planned foryour birthday.
- I didn'twant anyfuss this year.
- Get ready to change your mind cos I scored tickets Friday night to the best show in town.
Chimps On Ice.
Oh, my.
I know this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, but Duke saw it last week and he busted a gut.
And mind you, he even saw it with the understudy.
Dad, I really don't feel like going out on my birthday this year.
- Are you sure?
- Actually, I'd made plans.
I was going to watch television.
There's a new production of Cosi fan tutte.
No wonder, then.
You're missing a treat.
Duke said at the finale the cast skates to the top of a ramp and then splat!
Right into a tank ofwhipped cream.
Bet they don't do that at your opera.
No, and Mozart's still kicking himself.
Come on, boy.
Frasier, are you familiar with the Safari Club?
Of course.
Their yearly expeditions are remarkable.
They're legendary.
Last year they made camp at the base of Mount Everest, then had their servants climb it while they held a wine-tasting.
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because Allison is a member.
This Friday they're having a reception at her place and we're invited.
That's incredible.
- Consider it your birthday present.
- Thank you so much.
I told Dad I was going to stay home.
- Don't tell him about this.
- Don't worry.
I told him yesterday I was going away for the weekend.
- You knew about this yesterday?
- No, but I knew about Chimps On Ice.
I understand one of the members is going to show an old film he made of the rare and endangered species found only in the rainforest.
- Maris would have loved it.
- Why so?
She had shoes made from almost all of them.
- Allison.
- Niles.
And this must be Frasier.
Come in, both ofyou.
There are lots of people I'd like you to meet.
The bar is over there and the hors d'oeuvres are here.
We have some fascinating delicacies actually bagged by our own members.
This is ostrich, that's wildebeest and that's springbok.
I can never remember, is it "fall ahead, spring bok" or vice versa?
- I forgot I had this on me.
- Don't apologise.
I do it myself.
Even in the veldt one must keep in touch with one's broker.
- You can have privacy in the study.
- Thank you.
Hello?
You look ravishing tonight.
Thank you.
You and I should be very discreet tonight.
I'm a psychiatrist.
If I can't be discreet, it don't rain in Tanganyika.
After all, if in the near future, you should be up for membership in our club, I want to appear objective when I sing your praises.
My ears are already burning.
Frasier, we're being considered for membership.
We must show them how enthusiastic we are.
- I have to leave.
- What?
That was Tricia on the phone.
She's going out of town tonight for a month.
But if I pick her up at her place, we can at least have a drink.
Are you insane?
This is the Safari Club.
These are the people who introduced badminton to Devil's lsland.
They challenged the lepers of Molokai to a three-legged race.
I don't care.
It was kismet when I met Tricia.
I must see her.
To leave two minutes after arriving, you'll ruin our chances.
All right.
I'll make a proper excuse.
Excuse me, Allison.
I'm terribly sorry.
It seems I'm coming down with something.
I'm going to have to leave.
Ifyou feel better, please come back.
We'll be here all evening.
Thank you, but I don't really see that there's much hope.
I'm just picking up my keys.
I will see you in ten minutes.
And, Tricia, I can't wait.
All right, bye.
Surprise!
We weren't going to let you stay home alone on your birthday.
- Look at him.
He can't believe it.
- No, I certainly can't.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I dress like this sometimes when I watch the opera on television.
That's up there on the dork meter.
Since I'm not watching the opera, I should buy a tape so I can record it.
We're way ahead ofyou, Dr Crane.
Your father has the VCR all set up.
Let's get things started.
Here you go, Doc, happy birthday.
Thank you, Bulldog.
Thank you, all.
David Copperfield.
Dickens' classic tale of a man making his way in the world.
I thinkwe're talking about different movies here, Doc.
David Cop-A-Feel.
But you were right about the classic tail.
- You need a brew?
I'm headed that way.
- No, thanks.
- I'd love a cup of hot tea with lemon.
- I'm fetching, not cooking.
There's a kettle of boiling water on the stove.
Here you are.
Now don't be mad at your father.
He wanted to do something nice after you turned down the skating monkeys.
Great party.
As long as we've got enough ice.
Four bags, right?
- No, I got two.
- Two?
I told you to get four bags.
But you never under-budget on the ice.
You might get a lot more rocks drinkers than you expected.
- Or ice chewers - Dad, I can go get some more ice.
We don't need any more ice.
There's a whole tub of it.
Yes, well, then Excuse me.
I need to make a call.
Tricia?
Frasier.
I've been detained.
Yes, I know that you don't want to hear why, but I think I can find a way to get out of here.
Yes, I'll see you in a few minutes.
Dad, bad news.
Seems your ice is melting awfully fast.
- What?
- I'll go get some more.
No, it's your party.
I'll go.
You just got here.
Roz, it's my birthday.
I can do what I want.
I want to get ice.
I warned her.
It's practically gone.
Don't worry, Dad.
I'm on it.
- I'll be glad to go - I know what kind Dad likes.
No, don't, don't stop on 14.
Just don't stop on 14.
Frasier.
I'm delighted you're feeling better.
We're about to start the film.
Wait until you see it.
Just grab a chair before all the good seats are gone.
- What are you doing here?
- Wishing I had taken the stairs.
Watch it.
If I'd wanted this martini shaken, I'd have asked the bartender to do it.
Mustn't mind old Rhino.
Always in a vile mood.
- Rhino?
- Karl Landis, Allison's husband.
They call him Rhino because of his mean temper.
Husband?
Allison's married?
Not surprised people don't know.
He's always on safari.
Loves guns.
Guns and women.
No secret, notorious for it.
Cheats on her constantly.
Mark my words/ One day she'll pay him back and then rub his blood-thirsty nose in it.
I think I just swallowed my tongue.
Niles, just be calm.
You didn't know.
As long as you've both been discreet, there's no reason it should get back to Rhino.
- I don't know what you're insinuating.
- Don't lie.
Everyone knows what goes on in that pup tent.
Well, I can play at that game, too.
In fact, I already have.
And with somebody right here tonight.
How do you like that?
I need you to create a distraction while I have a sex change and move to Europe.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I would love to help, but I've got to get out of here myself.
Ready for the movie.
Mind helping me turn out the lights?
Splendid idea.
You're going to want it nice and dark in here, aren'tyou?
You should've told me you were married.
I must leave.
If he sees someone sneak out, that's the first person he'll suspect.
All set?
And it's show time.
Here underthe leafy canopy ofthe rainforest, the sun never penetrates the gloom of the interior.
An almost subterran - What happened?
- Did someone pull the plug out?
Yup.
Here it is.
All right, lights out.
quality permeates this hidden kingdom deep in the underbrush - and all manner of creatures - What was that?
Someone certainly snuck out of here in a hurry.
I know what you're all thinking.
Now that Allison has seen fit to air our dirty laundry in public, you assume that was her lover.
But I know it wasn't.
- How?
- I can sense that he's still here.
In the jungle I learned to smell fear and I smell it now.
So, let's see whether the swine has guts to stand up and admit it before I expose him.
What about it, coward?
Going to stand up?
That many?
My God, woman, you're as bad as I am.
Come on, you bastards, join me in a drink.
Hi, Dr Crane.
We're all on our way up to your place.
Noel, so you are.
Hi, Tom, Janet, Bill.
I was just heading down.
- We're out of ice.
- Not anymore.
I brought a 20-pound bag.
Just call me Noel Shempsky/ Party Saver.
Here's the ice.
Here, Noel, put that in the kitchen, will you?
Dad, I went out without my wallet.
They gave me the ice but I have to go back and pay them.
At least play the last round of charades with us.
- I should be getting back there.
- But you love charades.
It won't kill them to wait a few minutes for their money.
Be on our team.
We really suck at this.
- The category is famous play titles.
- I'm a bear at charades.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- All right, go.
Three words.
First word.
Mourning Becomes Electra.
- Yes!
- What?
Four seconds?
Well done, Roz.
Nice playing with you.
I'm out of here.
You have to take a turn.
You have 30 seconds to prepare.
Well, all right.
Maybe I'll just prepare in the kitchen.
Tricia!
You're going to laugh when you hearthis.
Hello?
Tricia?
Fine.
The Iceman Cometh - All right.
- Ready?
OK, go.
Three words.
First word.
A small word.
On?
In?
Of?
To?
Be?
Is?
It?
I?
You?
Me?
They, them, us, we, he, she.
Forget about it.
OK, second word.
Two syllables.
First syllable.
Cold, chilly, freezing, winter.
Snow, sleet, hail, frost, frostbite, gangrene.
- Gangrene?
- No talking allowed.
Second syllable.
Shrink.
Doctor.
Dork.
Person, guy, male, man.
Man, man, man.
Let's see, lcy cold man, ice man.
Got it.
- Thank you.
- Frosty The Snowman.
Yes!
No, you jackass!
The Iceman Cometh.
Disqualified.
You two are the worst charades players I've ever seen.
Those skating chimps could You did your best.
We'll get it next time.
Off I go.
No, wait, Frasier.
We still have a consolation prize for you.
Look, he's crying.
- Made it.
- Boy, are you wrong.
I have a plane leaving for Spokane in an hour.
My cab is on the way, so why don't you just be on your way, too?
But I had to sneak out of a birthday party being given for me by my own father just to come here.
Yeah, right.
It's your birthday.
Ifyou don't believe me, here, just see for yourself.
It's the worst birthday I've had since I was eight, when I pinned the tail on Sally Annunciato.
She shoved a cupcake down my shorts.
You really blew offyour own birthday party just to come meet me.
I would've done almost anything to get to know you better.
That's very sweet, and I wish I had more time but I have an 8.00am appointment in Spokane and I can't miss my plane.
- I could drive you.
- It's only 20 minutes to the airport.
- I wasn't talking about the airport.
- What?
I can get to Spokane in six hours.
Enough time to get acquainted.
- I can't ask you to do that.
- You didn't ask.
I offered.
I want to do it.
Here That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
One of two things can happen.
We'll discover that we've built each other up because we had such trouble getting together, or this could end up being a story we tell our grandchildren.
Personally, I can't wait to find out which.
Me neither.
Offwe go.
I thought I'd find us some background music.
Good idea.
Looking for some more opera?
No.
The one the other night was my first and last.
I was dragged to it by one of my converts.
There we go.
Converts, you say?
I'm one of the Truth-Bringers.
I was ordained by Brother Carmichael.
The evangelist?
I go door-to-door, spreading his word.
Do you mind my asking something?
Have you heard the truth?
Something tells me I'm about to.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
That's it fortoday, Seattle.
This is Doctor Frasier Crane wishing you good day and good mental health.
Move it.
Person waiting for the booth here.
That is not amusing in the men's room.
It's not amusing now.
- All ready then, Bulldog?
- What are you two doing?
We're recording an ad for a new sponsor.
By the way, Roz, baby or no baby, your ass has never looked better.
Shut up.
- How sick is that?
- He's just being Bulldog.
No, that I liked hearing it.
- Hi, I'm Bulldog Brisco.
- And I'm Gil Chesterton.
When Bulldog and I are out together - Whether it's at the opera.
- Or rooting our Mariners to victory.
We always round out the evening with a nice, relaxing cup of Happy Dreams Tea.
We're making some right now.
How many lumps do you like, Gil?
One, please.
Ouch!
Gets me every time.
Happy Dreams Tea.
One cup, you'll have happy dreams the whole night through.
Yes.
Perfect.
One take.
My "ouch" could be a bit more convincing.
We'll splice that in later.
- What was that?
- It's the new station manager's idea.
He's getting on-air talent to record commercials for sponsors.
Are you disappointed he didn't ask you to do it?
About as disappointed as when that hypnotist picked them to come up and groom each other like monkeys.
Yeah, you really lucked out.
He didn't make you do anything silly.
No, sir.
Roz.
Daphne, what're you doing here?
Dr Crane's car's in the shop, so I'm a chauffeur.
- There's a rally on Pike Street.
- What sort of rally?
They're trying to save a bookstore from being torn down.
Not Hirsch and Sons?
- They want to build a strip mall.
- That's a Seattle landmark.
My God, Mark Twain gave a reading there.
I know that place.
I had a boyfriend who liked to make out in the occult section.
I'm terribly upset about this.
We'll go down there and join that rally.
Good for you.
I refuse to stand by while some bully rides roughshod over the little people.
- I don't want to go to a rally.
- Tough luck.
You're the chauffeur.
This is rather exciting.
I never thought you to be the protest kind.
I was quite the activist in my college days.
Nothing like throwing in with a band ofyoung rebels thumbing their noses at convention.
Did you go for the whole package?
Long hair, beads?
No, I did have a pair of psychedelic suspenders that raised an eyebrow.
This seems good, don't you think?
Hey, this is great.
Hey, look, everybody, it's Dr Frasier Crane.
Hello.
Good to see you.
- Would you like to say a few words?
- Well, all right.
I'll keep it simple.
Be strong, people.
Our cause is just.
To the barricades.
This is sort offun, isn't it?
People, this is your final warning.
- What's that?
- It's the police.
Disperse now, or we will take action.
- What do you they mean by that?
- We're not going anywhere, are we?
- Are they talking about a jail thing?
- Who knows?
Exciting, isn't it?
They'll have to drag us out of here.
They don't actually drag people away anymore, do they?
Cos they're too afraid to arrest us, aren't they?
Now you're just provoking them.
All right, people, you had your warning.
They weren't kidding.
There go the first lucky martyrs to our cause.
At the rate they're dragging people away, there'll be nobody left to protest.
I better get reinforcements.
Dr Crane, where are you going?
Solidarity, brothers.
- Hello, Niles.
- I hope you're free tonight.
I just secured a table at the most exclusive new restaurant in Seattle.
- I'm not in the mood.
- At least hear me out.
This place is the hottest new thing in fusion cuisine.
What cuisines are being fused?
Polynesian and Scandinavian.
It's called Mahalo Valhalla.
Perhaps there's a reason God put those two countries so far apart.
My gourmet newsletter gave three and a halfwhisks to their coconut herring.
I'm sorry, Niles.
Tonight's just a bad night.
Daphne's been hauled down to jail.
Dad's down there trying to bail her out.
- What?
- They should be home any minute.
It's just that she was down at that rally for Hirsch and Sons bookstore.
The worst part of it is I convinced her to go.
When they started hauling people away, I chickened out and ran.
- You left her there?
- It was a shameful performance.
But I did clear that hedge in front of Emerson's Funeral Home Iike a Kentucky show horse, but What has happened to me, Niles?
I used to be so courageous, to fight for things.
When did I become so middle-aged, so timid?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We all get a bit more cautious as we get older.
Not me.
God, it was only five years ago I packed up my whole life in Boston, moved across the country to start over.
That took real courage.
Now, the biggest risk I take is saying to Dad, "Let's go out to dinner.
You pick the restaurant".
Daphne, it's so good to have you home safe and sound.
Sod off.
- She's a little mad at you.
- Yes, thank you, Dad.
Daphne, I am so sorry.
I feel just terrible.
As you should.
You left me handcuffed and helpless.
Ifyou're ever in that position again, be sure to call on me.
For help.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
Shame on you, Dr Crane.
Why can't you be more like Dr Crane?
It took me six hours to get her out.
In my days cops could count on a few perks.
No speeding tickets.
Get your friends out of jail fast.
It's all gone to hell.
Let's hope they never do away with that "all jewellery up for grabs in the morgue" policy.
I'm not letting this dinner reservation go to waste.
Frasier?
- Thanks anyway, Niles.
- Very well.
Dad, what about you?
Maybe I will come and get a bite with you.
Sitting around six hours in that station house, I could eat anything.
- Let's go, then.
- I can't wait.
Where are we going, anyway?
Hello?
Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
What toppings?
Just a second.
Dad, what do you want on your pizza?
- Pepperoni.
- Pepperoni, please.
We've been fighting a lot and she's neverin the mood for sex.
I think she's having an affair.
Let's not give in to paranoia.
Just because your wife is avoiding sex doesn't mean she's being unfaithful.
You said you haven't been talking lately.
Why don't you try re-opening the lines of communication tonight by surprising herwith a nice, romantic dinner?
Tonight's no good.
She's working late on herboss'boat again.
But tomorrow's OK.
Thanks, Dr Crane.
Roz, what do you say we turn things over to our eye on the sky, Chopper Dave, with the traffic report?
I want to introduce you to our new station manager, Kenny Daly.
It's a pleasure.
No, it's my pleasure.
I have to say, I'm just a huge fan.
I only had this reaction once before.
You ever hear of Norman Mailer?
Of course, the author.
No, I'm talking about the drive-time guy, worked out of Tampa?
"Norman in the Mornin"'.
So funny you'd pray for traffic.
I'll try to catch him the next time I'm in Tampa.
In the mornin'.
- It's been great meeting you.
- You, too.
I got a call from the Happy Dreams Tea people.
They had spots scheduled for your first hour and you forgot to read them.
I didn't forget.
I looked at the copy and I couldn't read it.
Why not?
Well, just listen to this.
"One cup of Happy Dreams Tea and you'll have happy dreams all night".
Dreams are a by-product of unresolved emotion.
No tea can promise happy dreams.
I totally get that.
Our ad revenues are down and they're a major new sponsor.
I promised them that you'd read the ads this hour.
As a psychiatrist, I can't.
They promise something impossible.
Now I understand.
What if we just think of it more as a slogan?
But it's not a slogan.
If l, as a doctor, read it, - it sounds like medical advice.
- OK.
Now, totally get it.
Instead of saying Dr Frasier Crane, don't say "doctor".
I'm not making myself clear here.
Let's try this.
I will never read this copy.
This is the part of my job I hate.
You take a stand like that and I totally respect it, by the way, and you force my hand.
That's our biggest sponsor.
Unless you go on the air and read that ad, I have to fire you.
Ten seconds, Frasier.
I didn't realise you felt so strongly about it.
I guess I have no choice.
Thanks, Dr Crane.
What a relief.
Hello, Seattle.
The people who know me best will not be surprised by what I'm about to tell you.
I am not a man who betrays his principles.
I am not a man who misleads his listeners and I am not a man who will shrink from a fight.
Today, I find myself in a fight over the content of my show.
But rather than truckle to the forces of commercialism, I've decided to take a stand on principle, even it means - I'm not on the air, am l?
- No.
He put on the Best of Crane.
- How much did I get out?
- Well, let's see.
People who know me best will not be surprised by what I'm about to tell you.
I am not a man Perfect.
So they fired you?
Yes.
And I must say it feels good to take a stand like this.
I feel like my old self again.
I'll tell you one thing, I don't envy Kenny.
Feeling the cold stares ofthe other employees because he's fired the station's most popular personality.
He fired Tooty the Story Lady, too?
Very funny, Niles.
Who would have thought that getting fired can make one feel so alive?
What do you want?
Another staring contest, I suppose?
Well, you picked the wrong day for that.
Take that.
- Frasier, what are you doing home?
- Dad, brace yourself.
The station fired me.
So you'll be seeing me this time every day.
That's terrible.
- I assume you mean the firing part.
- Well, yeah.
So what happened?
They asked me to violate a principle I believe in and I refused.
I'm proud ofyou.
What did theywantyou to do?
There's this product and theywanted me to say it gives people happy dreams.
And?
I couldn't make a claim like that.
All commercials promise things they can't deliver.
That may be Like cologne driving women wild.
I used it all my life and never had a single woman come on to me.
- Except that year I worked in Vice.
- Yes, I understand.
- But that wasn't about cologne.
- Yes, I understand.
- They were hookers.
- I realise that!
Frasier, don't be angry with me, but I do have one theory.
I was wondering when you'd get around to that so, allow me.
I was so ashamed of my chickening out at the rally that I grabbed at the first fight that came my way.
It turned out to be the wrong fight and I lost my job.
So if you follow that theory through to the end, this heady feeling of euphoria I'm experiencing right now is nothing more than a deep-seated denial.
- So have you considered it?
- Not for a second.
Hello.
I know I'm the last person you want to see, but since I fired you, I haven't been able to eat or sleep.
Kenny, it's only been an hour and a half.
Well, I'm a napper.
I was wrong.
I just fired a man who was willing to go to the mat for his principles.
What does that say about mine?
Before I go on, have you had any job offers?
He's had four.
Shut up.
I'm still technically available.
I'd like you to come back to work.
I'm calling the Happy Dreams people and telling them you're uncomfortable with their ads.
At KACL, the talent comes first.
Well, what can I say but see you tomorrow.
This is so great.
I'm so relieved.
Can I buy you a beer just to show we have no hard feelings?
I would love that.
As long as I don't have to endorse it afterwards.
I guess I had that one coming.
Nice meeting you.
Good afternoon, Seattle, this is Dr Frasier Crane and I would like to begin today by apologising for my abrupt departure from the airwaves yesterday.
You see, I was embroiled in a conflict with the management.
I'm happy to report it's been resolved, thanks to the efforts of our new station manager, a courageous and principled young man, Ken Daly.
I won't bore you with all the details, but he took on the big guys and won.
Anyway, I apologise for our brief interruption yesterday and I assure you that today's will be even briefer.
Roz, let's go to commercial.
- Kenny, what's going on?
- It's the darndest thing.
I got fired.
What?
Well, how did that happen?
I told the sponsors you wouldn't be reading their ads.
Then I'm called into Mr Martin's office in the Black Tower.
I said sponsors are easier to replace than talent.
He said I was easier to replace than anybody.
Then he called me a pinhead and took my Coke away.
That's terrible.
Kenny, I can't help feeling that this is all my fault.
These things happen.
If I've got to get fired sticking up for someone, I'm honoured it was for you.
At least now I'll have time to finish building that nursery.
We're expecting.
There's my wife now.
She'll get a kick out ofthis coincidence.
Me and her getting fired in the same week.
- May l?
- Of course.
- We have got to get Kenny's job back.
- How are we supposed to do that?
We'll just round up all the talent, go down to Mr Martin and demand that he rehire Kenny.
He owns the station.
We can't give him an ultimatum.
It's not an ultimatum.
We'll appeal to his sense of decency.
Kenny went to bat for me.
Kenny hasn't asked for our help.
For all we know, he'll be fine.
How do you like that?
She's having twins.
Heck of a time for me to lose my insurance.
Well, you guys take care.
Together we can do this.
The important thing is to present a united front.
What is the matter with you people?
We're frightened.
- Ofwhat?
- Of everything.
We're in the Black Tower.
Those lobby guards must have been seven feet tall.
And that metal detector we had to go through was scary.
It was even scarier finding out Gil wears an anklet.
Get off the elevator, all of you!
I'm ashamed of you.
Intimidated by a building.
We're here for Kenny, the man who wants to start KACL daycare, Roz.
The man who approved the airbrushing charges on your publicity photos, Gil.
And, Tooty, who was it that just doubled the Story Time puppet budget?
I know Kenny's a great guy but I met Joe Martin once.
He was a very scary man with eyes as cold as a winter night All right, Tooty.
Mr Martin.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- My name is Dr Frasier Crane.
I am here with some talent from KACL.
My producer, Roz Doyle.
Gil Chesterton, food critic.
Bob Brisco, sports.
Tooty Feingold, the Story Lady.
Ray Schmidt, the Green Grocer and Miss Judy, arts and crafts.
Sorry, Judy, I don't know your last name.
I'm in the middle of a board meeting.
This will only take a moment.
This morning you fired Kenny Daly, a wonderful station manager and a man of integrity.
That is a very rare quality in this industry.
You fire all the Kenny Dalys, what are you left with?
A bunch of sycophants and yes-men.
Am I right?
Now it would be a great risk to hire Kenny back.
But a man that stops taking risks in life pays a very dear price indeed.
I know whereof I speak.
And I can see that I'm getting through to you, so let me just leave you with one last question.
What kind of radio station do you want?
Dr Crane, that is the exact question I've been asking myself all through that board meeting.
As you know, our ratings are down, and the number crunchers in there think they can fix it by sucking up to our sponsors.
Well, that's not what I think.
Thanks to you, I'm going with my gut on this one.
- You bet you are.
- I'm going to go in there and tell them we're doing it my way.
No more talk.
Exactly.
Action.
No, no more talk radio.
From this moment on, the station is all Latino music, all the time.
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you, Dr Crane.
I'm going back to my roots.
I may have walked out ofthat meeting Joe Martin, corporate sell-out, but I'm walking back in Jos√© Martinez, risk taker.
- What just happened?
- You just got us all fired.
- What did you say?
- All right, don't panic!
