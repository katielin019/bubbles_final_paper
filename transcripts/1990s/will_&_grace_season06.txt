{START OF EPISODE 1}
Get out of my bed!
You get out of my bed!
That's your bed!
This is my bed!
If this was your bed, it would already be made.
If this was your bed, it would be shaped like a race car, and you'd be clutching your woowie.
Now scram, I'm naked over here!
Wait a minute I'm naked too!
Guys!
You would not believe what I just found in Leo's bag a love letter from that bitch, Dr. Morty.
When I think of how I almost didn't read it because I was respecting his privacy, it makes me so glad I'm never honest!
Come on, I need to talk it out.
Uh, ah, we'll-- We'll join you in a sex-- Suck--!
Sex--!
Two minutes!
Yeah, and then you can tell us all the nudes-- Dudes--!
Man-on-man action!
Hello hurry up.
I'm freakin' out here.
Oh, my God!
You two Have a little CD player?
No fair!
I hate this boat.
Well, this is just great.
When we get to St. Barts, I am buying myself an E-P-T.
And so help me, if that stick is blue..
I am not going through this alone.
Not again.
Let's just figure this out, okay?
Now what What did we do last night?
We--we--we-- we drank a lot, we danced, we peed off the side of the boat.
But at some point, I came down here to crash.
That much I remember.
And--and I remember waking up and realizing we were in bed naked with each other.
Rightbecause that happened 30 seconds ago!
Look, if something happened, you would've remembered, because it's so rare for you.
Right.
And if something had happened, you would've left and my wallet would be missing.
So nothing happened.
nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
It's funny I tell ya I guess we should get dressed.
Wait a minute, my wallet is missing.
Will & Grace episode 06x01 "Dames At Sea" synchro:Marksbeb Do you believe her?
I mean, who does that?
Who sends a love letter to a married man?
I mean, it's one thing if it's your roommate's dad that looks like Mark Spitz and drives a Datsun 280ZX, and you're pretty sure he winked when he said he had an office in the city.
As random example.
"Leo, we're going to be spending a lot of time together".
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
"Something I could never say to you.
I want you".
Wow.
"You can have me wherever, whenever".
That's hot.
Yeah.
Do you believe her?
I just wish I knew some voodoo so I could cast a spell on her and turn her into a ferret.
Yeah, that's pretty much your only option.
Okay, then we've got to go down to Guatemala and stop her before she does something.
Grace, you are way over-reacting to this.
He's right.
Besides, you should've seen this coming, Grace.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, it's karma, dear.
Yeah.
It's what you get for marrying above your station.
See, by marrying Leo, who-- if I may compare both of you to cuts of meat-- is a Grade "A" slab of prime rib, while you-- you're just a plain-looking girl.
You have spat in God's eye and now must be punish-ed.
Ooh, stress wrinkle, right there in the-- Grace!
Please, let me just beat him until he bleeds!
Calm down, Grace!
What are you going to do?
You gonna fly to Guatemala, track him down, make some big scene like some crazy Guatemalan scene maker?
-you're--you're-- you're keyed up over nothing.
It's just a letter.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just a letter.
He's not gonna respond to that.
I, myself, have written him several letters all unspeakably filthy.
And I didn't get nothing but a wink and a smile.
-So he's not gonna?
-No.
-And she's not gonna?
-No.
-And they're not gonna?
-No.
Thanks, Will, it's so good to talk it out.
Wait, what's that?
It sounds like another boat.
Hold on, Rosie, we're almost there!
Oh, my God, what happened to you guys?
Lorraine tried to kill me!
She threw me overboard.
Rosie jumped in after.
And then this Russian freighter came by, pulled us out.
We spent the night.
It was horrible.
This morning, we swiped their jet ski.
That's Russian for jet ski.
Aw, Karen, that's awful.
Could you point out the coordinates on this map?
You know, out there in that icy water I stared death in the face.
And let me tell you, it wasn't pretty.
Ah!
There it is again!
Yuk yuk yuk.
I saved your miserable life out there.
Honey, I'm sorry.
You're right.
If you hadn't turned your support hose into a life vest and used your bra as a sail I might not still be here.
That's right.
So don't forget your promise.
Promise?
I don't remember any promise.
You're not weaseling out of this, sister.
You promised me one Friday off a month.
Talk to the boob!
Karen, the woman saved your lifeinexplicably.
She's asking for so little stupidly.
Oh, all right.
But I don't want the rest of the staff finding out about this.
So you tell them you're getting monthly hormone treatments to turn into a man.
Or a woman, whichever is more believable.
this whole thing has just been so exhausting I buried my husband, almost died, learned to dance the ksiazka.
Would you kids mind if we just headed back to New York?
Of course not.
Guys, do you mind missing St. Barts?
I can't speak for Jack, but, you know, I don't mind kissing him-- Kissing it-- Missing it!
Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting home to dry hump-- dry land-- hump Will!
Wait a minute.
If Lorraine threw you overboard, doesn't that mean she's still here?
My God, you're right.
That Brit's still on this boat.
Come on, let's put a little Colgate on a toothbrush and see if we can scare her out of her cabin.
What's that?
It's Lorraine!
She's taking your jet ski!
Speak English.
It's Lorraine!
She's taking your jet ski!
Will, you're my lawyer, do something.
You!
!
I'm really more of a litigator.
Guess what?
Leo's coming home!
Why?
What happened?
His passport and all his papers were in the bag he left on the boat.
He spent four days in a tiny holding room at the Guatemala City airport with two missionaries and two people in the missionary position.
Dr. Morty never got a chance to make her moves on.
Thank God.
I was a little worried.
You said I had nothing to worry about.
Leo's coming home!
Yay!
Okay, now what do I do with the letter?
Throw it out.
I could.
But then he'll never know the truth about her.
So show it to him.
But then he'll know I snooped.
No, he's got to find this on his own.
And I've got to be there when he reads it so I can act all shocked about it.
Ooh, I know what I'll do.
I'll do this.
No, too big.
Maybe Maybe just one.
Grace, do you work?
Or do you just spend the day practicing your reactions?
Thought so.
- Oh, I was just putting out the garbage and I got so much to do so - Oh, you know, things are crazy right now with the holidays What was that weirdness just now?
What weirdness?
Didn't notice.
Must've happened after I left.
Give it up.
Okay.
Look.
Is this from the Betty Rubble collection?
Will.
Remember when--on the boat when you came into the room, and--and--and Jack and I were in bed Right.
Without any clothes on after a night of drinking - Oh, my God!
!
- And we're gay don't freak out.
Nothing happened I think.
What do you mean, you think?
- I don't remember.
- Oh!
Oh, right!
It's not funny.
You and Jack finding love.
Becoming lovers.
Were there kisses?
- Were there butterfly kisses?
- Oh, stop it.
This isn't funny.
Jack-- I-- I think Jack may have feelings for me.
Of course he does.
He's always had a thing for you.
And now you tossed him a bone.
Or he tossed you a bone.
I wasn't there, I don't know what happened.
But I do think you're gonna have to let him down easy.
How do you do that?
You know, how do ya-- How do ya tell someone that you have kind of a history with that you're just not interested in them romantically?
I guess I could start with a plate of soft cheeses Oh, my God!
You and Will?
God, why don't you tell the whole restaurant?
Don't make a big deal about it.
Nothing even happened I think.
You think?
Honey, either you know or you don't.
Unless you're lucky enough to be married to a man like my late husband who always let me sleep through it.
Hey there, big guy in the sky.
Here's a little somethin' for ya.
I can't believe I was in bed with Will.
When I woke up and saw that olive skin and that furry body, I thought, "Please, God, let it be a giant furry olive".
But you know the worst part, Karen?
you're both men?
No.
I think Will has feelings for me.
Well, of course he has feelings for you, honey.
I mean, look at his love life.
The only man he's had in the last 16 years is Grace.
You're right.
That poor, unlucky, pear-shaped bastard.
What should I do, Kare, what should I do?
Well, honey, you gotta end it.
I mean, if you let it go -- Wait, are refills free?
- Not on cappuccinos.
I could put coffee in it.
- Thanks.
-Great - If you let it go on any longer, he'll just get more and more obsessed.
I mean, next thing you know, he's moving in next door, and-- - He already has!
- You're right, Kare.
I gotta end it.
And I gotta end it now.
- No, no, honey.
Not now.
-Why?
-Coffee.
what's the emergency?
It's Friday-- my day off, remember?
I'm on my way to a taping of "Whoopi".
I know, Rosie, but I really do need you.
I've decided to start collecting those wooden nesting dolls.
Go around town and see what you can pick up.
Yeah, I like the way they start out big and then get little teeny-tiny.
Go.
Forget it.
I saved your miserable gin-soaked life.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said I like the way they get little teeny-tiny.
Go.
Oh, hey, Rosie.
Table for one?
I'm not staying.
But I will have a biscotti.
I hear those tapings can go on for hours.
Oh, my god, she's choking!
Well, well, well.
The hunter has become the Mexican.
aren, save her.
This restaurant cannot weather another tragedy!
Oh, I'll save her Just as long as she goes back to working every Friday.
I-N-S!
There.
We're even.
I'll start looking for those dolls.
You--you know, I'm going to have to charge you for that biscotti.
Sweetie, you're home.
Come on.
Unpack your bag.
Make sure your passport's there, along with your other stuff-- underwear, letters, whatever.
Later, later.
I--I had a bumpy landing.
It kinda, you know, got me in the mood.
Oh.
Oh, oh, okay.
- Well, you know what gets me in the mood?
- What's that?
Knowing that my man has proper international travel documentation.
Okay, okay, I'll--I'll--I'll-- I'll look.
- What's this?
- Hmm, looks like a letter.
- It's a letter.
- That's what I thought too.
- It's from Dr. Morty.
- Dr. Morty?
Why is, uh, why is she writing me?
Hello.
Oh, man.
Man--whew, man.
Yeah, it's my itinerary.
It is not!
Is it?
!
I don't know!
Grace, you, uh, you--you obviously read it.
And thank God!
She wants you, Leo.
But I don't-- I don't want her.
Please.
You're two hot people down in the sunny tropics with nothing else to do but have sex.
I know.
I've been to Daytona twice.
Grace, Doctors Without Borders is there to prevent an entire population from being annihilated by infectious diseases.
Yeah, for, like, 20 minutes a day.
Then it's "doctors without bottoms".
Sweetie, she's nothing to me.
And by the way, in-in-in the future, if you're gonna go through my things, just try to be a little bit more thorough.
- These are all pictures of me.
- Yeah.
My eyes are closed in all of them.
That's because you're asleep I-I-I took them before I left, because I can't sleep unless you're asleep next to me.
That is so sweet.
And so creepy.
- So are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
You know, all I could think about since I left was one of your home cooked meals.
So let's go upstairs and have sex.
- Then we'll spend all day tomorrow in bed.
- Oh, oh, baby, baby, I can't.
I have an early flight.
- You're leaving?
No, you just got here.
- I know, but they're expecting me back.
Look, I-- I'm gonna go jump in the shower.
You put on the panties I got you for Passover, and I'll meet you in the bedroom.
Hi.
I need to talk to you just for a second.
Good, 'cause I-I-I need to talk to you too.
- So-- - Yeah.
I, um, I discovered a new cheese over the weekend.
Cowgirl Creamery.
You want to try some?
I would.
- This Cowgirl Creamery is a very good cheese.
- Thank you.
That's a nice top.
Thanks.
Just got it.
- I'm not interested in you.
- I'm not interested in you.
- No, I'm not interested in you.
- No, I'm not interested in you.
- No, I'm not interested in you!
- No, I'm not interested in you!
What are you doing?
!
I'm letting you down easy!
Nuh-uh!
If anyone's letting anyone down easy, I'm letting down you.
And yet you're wooing me with soft cheeses and compliments to the top.
Jack, come on.
This clearly meant more to you than it did to me because, well, look at me.
I am, and I'm looking at a forehead with teeth.
ack, you have feelings for me.
How else do you explain constantly offering to spot me at the gym?
- That's what you do at the gym.
- In the sauna?
Look, if anyone has feelings for anyone, it's you for me.
Signing us up for a tango class.
Signing us up for a cooking class.
Everyone knows you express your love through the dance and the bake.
- Let's just forget about who has more of a thing for whom.
- You for me.
- I said forget it!
Whatever happened on that boat wouldn't have happened unless there was something lurking in our relationship for a long time.
Something we--we need to start dealing with honestly.
So is that what we're doing now?
We're just being honest?
I think we have to if there's any hope of getting past this.
Well, if we're being honest, I guess I'd be lying if I said I never And I'd by lying if I said I never Wilma, take off your homo hat and put on your lawyer hat.
That damn Rosario saved my life again!
You know how I'm in a gang, right?
Well, I flashed my colors in the wrong neighborhood and suddenly I'm surrounded.
I'm about to take a cap to TYE dome when Rosie screeches up in the limo, pulls me in and guns it.
Now she wants her day off and a pizza party with the maids.
So, get me out of it.
Oh, by the way, every room in the boat is under video surveillance.
I took a look at the tape and nothing happened between you guys, just the occasional gas and some soft weeping.
Whew, there's a lot of caffeine in a Red Bull!
See ya!
- So Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened!
R-O-L-A-I-D-S.
Us.
I know, you're gross.
And you're a pasty-faced, middle-aged woman.
- I'm glad we're back to this.
- Uh, me too.
Hey, want to go see a movie later?
Maybe a documentary that raises more questions than it does answers.
Okay, I like that.
- Oh, thank god that weirdness is over.
- Oh, thank god.
Leo, come on.
You're gonna miss your plane.
I can't find my bucky pillow.
- That's so cute.
You named your pillow?
- No, it's a bucky pillow.
It's for the plane.
It goes around your neck like this.
Oh, is that what that's for?
'Cause, you know, it also goes around the toilet seat like that.
Want me to get it?
Let's just hope that that's the last thing my neck and your ass have to share.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I wrote you a letter.
- But don't read it.
You have to wait until you go to bed tonight.
- Of course.
No, no, no.
I'm--I'm serious.
This is really important to me.
I want this to be the last thing you see before you fall asleep.
Okay, the first time I agreed, I was lying.
But now that I know it's really important, I'm really gonna do it.
Okay.
Now come here.
Put some of that stank on me.
- Call me the second you get there.
- I will.
- Bye.
- Be safe.
Okay.
Who am I kidding?
"Dear Grace, I can't believe I'm saying good-bye to you again.
Last night, I was watching you sleep.
And, well, it just made me realize it's so much better than sleeping next to a picture.
If you're reading this, you're probably in your nightgown ready to crawl into bed or it's been 30 seconds and you're in the same outfit because you can't follow a simple instruction.
Either way, I'm not leaving.
I'm giving up Doctors Without Borders.
I'm on the other side of the door".
What?
I'm on the other side of the door.
Oh, my God.
Are you sure?
I don't want you to do this for me.
I'm--i'm doing it for us.
Why did you do the whole letter thing?
Why didn't you just tell me in person?
Well, 'cause-- 'cause you tend to, uh, to hit when you get excited.
No, I don't.
I can't believe you're staying!
So what are you sayin', counselor?
There's nothin' I can do?
I'm sorry.
You and Rosario have a verbal agreement, and you have to live up to it.
But I just saved her life.
Holding a toaster over the bathtub and not dropping it is not saving her life.
Oh, all right.
She can have her damn day off and her pizza party.
But no sleepovers.
And no correspondence with her family!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hi, guys.
Hi, Grace.
I like your new crew cut.
Over here.
Oh.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Grace.
I like your new crew cut.
- Two lattés, please.
Thank you.
- Oh, waiter, could get me a slice of raw beef and some water?
You still on the Zone diet?
It's tough.
I stopped after the snacks tried to break out of their containers.
No, silly.
It's for my dog.
Oh, my God, I love dogs.
Let me see the little gerbil?
No, this is Chompers, the Earl of Puppydom.
He belonged to Lorraine.
We found him in the back of Stan's closet living off of little bits of turkey he found in Stan's trouser cuffs.
I'd keep him, but every time I see him, he makes me think of Lorraine.
She used to sit on the couch at gnaw at her ass too.
Anyway, I'm glad you're all here.
Tomorrow night, I have something very special planned for all of us.
Yay.
- Leo and I are having a dinner party.
- Boo.
- Leo's ex-girlfriend is coming.
- Yay.
- But I'm fine with it.
So there's no drama.
- Boo.
Really?
His ex is coming?
- Ya-- - Stop it!
Yeah, Leo said that he ran into her in the subway.
And being the cool wife that I am, I said, "Invite her over.
It'll be fun".
You're hoping she has big ears and buckteeth, right?
Little bit.
You know, I was kinda worried you'd be jealous of Diane.
I mean, she's cute, she's smart, she's an editor at Vogue.
Her piece on eyebrow shaping won the coveted Shallow Award.
Big whoop.
So you had a fling before me.
I had hundreds.
It was like a a revolving door, loser after loser after loser after Wait.
Ah, shoot.
You know, we only have five wine glasses?
I'll just wash out one of the glasses we use to keep our toothbrushes in.
Hi.
You must be Diane.
I'm Grace.
Hi.
Uh-oh.
Awkward moment.
New wife meets the ex-girlfriend.
You think he traded down, I think he traded up.
You're a gorgeous redhead, I'm an adorable blonde.
But we know we have something in common brown hair.
Come on in.
Hey, is that Diane?
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey, hey, hey.
How you doin'?
I'm good.
Wow.
A room full of Leo lovin' ladies.
I'd give anything to take that back.
Well, you did good, Leo.
Man, she's pretty.
I hope you don't mind me judging you solely on the basis of your looks.
Oh, please, how else would you judge someone?
Hey, I brought you something.
Oh, my God.
That is fantastic.
Is it?
It was in a basket in front of your neighbor's door.
Maybe I should keep it.
- No.
You've got the Hermès Birkin bag.
I love that bag!
- Oh, I love it too.
Well, lookie-loo.
Same taste in bags same taste in dudes.
I promise, I'll stop.
I've been on a waiting list for that bag for two years, you bitch.
I can say that, right?
We're in that place?
Oh, we're way past that place, you dirty skank.
You know what?
Here.
Take it.
What?
No.
No, I couldn't.
Oh, please.
Writing for Vogue, they give you tons of swag.
Besides, I want you to like me.
Dia--It's okay, Diane.
She likes you already.
No, it helps.
All right, so I'll be right back.
I gotta fix all this.
Um, I kinda thought you were gonna be butt-ugly.
Leo.
- She's nice, huh?
- Nice?
She's fantastic.
You traded down.
Wait.
You know, I am so proud of you.
I mean, I thought meeting my ex was gonna be much harder for you.
Why?
What'd you think I'd do?
Fall back, clutch myself, gasping?
"Oh, my God".
Don't flatter yourself.
Well, how can I not?
I mean, at the moment, I've had sex with everyone in this apartment.
Including myself.
Hi, lovers.
Hi, Grace.
Hi, Lebron.
Is she here?
Is she pretty?
Is she prettier than you?
Is she prettier than me?
She's great.
Really.
She gave me a purse.
Look.
The Hermès Birkin bag!
I've been--I've been on that waiting list for two years.
For my mother.
Honey, we got you a dog.
- A dog?
- Yeah.
I've always wanted a dog.
And I still do.
This looks like something a dog coughed up.
No thanks.
Hey, this is Chompers.
The Earl of Puppydom.
On cold nights, he keeps your privates warm I've heard.
Hi, everybody.
Oh, everybody, this is Diane.
This is Jack and Karen.
- And this is - Will ?
Diane?
How do you guys know each other?
- We once, um-- - Hey, I know who you are!
This is the only girl Will has ever had sex with.
Oh My God!
- Oh, my God?
- Oh My God!
I forgot to salt the tomatoes.
And they are certainly not going to salt themselves!
No!
What's going on?
Nothing.
I'm salting tomatoes.
Yeah?
'Cause it looks like you're assaulting them.
Why did you invite her here?
She's ruining everything.
What, 'cause she slept with Will?
What, are you jealous of them?
I'm not jealous.
And I'll tell you why I'm jealous.
Because I'm not jealous.
- You're not making any sense.
- Oh, and all of the sudden, you're the President of "Things That Make Sense"?
I'm so sorry didn't call you back the next day or-- ever again.
Yeah.
Well, I-I-I was a little surprised when I woke up and you were gone.
But I did appreciate that you baked cookies and did a load of whites.
My way of apologizing.
I just--I just felt so weird about the whole thing because I was-- I--I was gay, you know.
I still am.
Yeah.
Like I didn't know that.
How did you know?
Probably 'cause you put your rubber on with your pinky up, Mary.
That and that you were kind, sweet, sensitive, wanted to cuddle a lot.
Don't straight guys like to cuddle?
Not in an attempt to delay intercourse.
But, you know, the dead giveaway was that you cried the whole time we were doing it.
Don't straight guys like to cry?
Di, if I may get a little personal on your ass.
What magical twist of fate brought you two kids together?
Well, I was blind drunk, and my roommate was under observation for pulling all of her hair out.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
We'll be right back.
We're talking with one-night stand Diane.
I like you.
Wanna make out?
I like you too.
Let's see how the evening goes.
So You and Will, huh?
Yep, me and Will And, uh, me and you, huh?
Yeah.
Me and you.
And maybe later, me and Karen.
So in a way, you and Will have slept together.
So technically, you're bi.
We'll be right back.
We're talkin' with swings-both-ways Leo.
You know if you chop that any finer, the guests are going to have to snort it.
Why don't you tell Diane?
I'm sure she'll find it hi-i-i-ilarious.
Are you mad at me?
No.
I'm not mad.
And I'll tell you why I'm mad.
Because I'm not mad.
- You're not making any sense.
- Oh!
And all of the sudden, you're the Vice President of "Things That Make Sense"?
- Why vice president?
- Because Leo's president.
Deal with it.
- What is wrong with you?
- Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Diane.
That seems to be the cure for everything.
Dinner!
Come on, Chompers.
Pee pee, poo poo.
Do your dirty for daddy.
What are you doing?
Well, you told us to take him for a walk.
Not around my dining room.
Fine.
We'll take him out.
Well, Grace, everything smells delicious.
Whoops!
You almost made it, Chompers.
It's as big as he is!
Well, maybe not everything.
- Did he just--?
- Don't worry Grace, I put a salad bowl over it.
Can we open the $25 bottle of wine I brought?
'Cause I think we're done with the $6 stuff.
It's-- it's my fault.
I thought two bottles per person was going to be enough.
Maybe if we were in high school.
I'm the same way.
I always keep track of whatever I bring to a party.
If I had a dollar for every piece of Tupperware I never got back I'd have $13.
Big surprise.
You agree with her, but you don't agree with me.
- You didn't say anything for me to agree with.
- You didn't give me a chance to say anything, did you?
Mmm.
Grace, this is delicious.
It's so nice to be around people who eat food.
When somebody has a birthday at Vogue, they put a candle in the middle of a Lifesaver and then argue about who gets the smallest piece.
- I made these kabobs for Grace once.
She totally fell in love with the recipe.
- Liar!
How could I fall in love with your kabobs?
I've never had them.
Diane had your kabobs.
But apparently, I wasn't good enough for your kabobs.
Wait.
Why do you care that Diane's had Will's kabobs, but you don't care that she's had mine and I've had hers?
Silly.
Diane is a girl.
She doesn't have kabobs.
She has a kagina.
And nice katits.
You know, Grace, I was with Diane a year and a half.
It wasn't just one drunken night in a dorm room.
It was a lot of drunken nights.
Including one embarrassing incident involving a public bathroom and an untimely entrance by Ed Koch.
By the way, I know it seems like I need to drink in order to have sex.
I don't, it just makes it better.
Nobody finds you interesting.
Except your husband and your best friend?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, you know, it's--it's a--it's a party.
Let's let lose a-a-and eat frosting right out of the can.
Will's right.
Now come on, come on.
Change the subject.
For gosh sakes.
So, Diane, you work for Vogue, huh?
Who was a better lay, Huck Finn or Captain Homo?
Come on!
Who was better?
Who was better?
No.
We are not discussing this.
It's not a competition.
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.
- Will was better.
- Yes!
What do you mean "Will was better"?
He couldn't find a G-spot with Yahoo!
Maps.
Yahoooooooooo-hoo!
Leo, don't let it bug you.
I'm sure there's plenty of things you're better at.
They just don't involve sex with a woman.
You know, I don't have to defend myself here.
Grace can tell you how good I am.
Two words: Disneyland.
Jail.
Well, you know, I'd love to help you out, sweetie.
But I really don't have any basis for comparison.
You see, I've had you, but I've never had, uh, this guy.
Because apparently, I wasn't good enough.
Are you ever gonna let this go?
No.
I don't understand.
When I found out that you slept with someone right after you couldn't do it with me, I always thought that--that--that the woman would be totally different than me.
You know, ugly.
And then this walked in.
Hi.
She is beautiful.
She's funny.
She's smart.
She's like my twin.
Yeah.
Right honey.
Just like Randy Quaid is Dennis Quaid's twin.
So what was it, Will?
Why her and not me?
Excuse me!
I had an actual relationship with this woman.
I mean, she had a drawer at my apartment.
I-I called her parents Papa Tom and Mama Joanne.
You know, I-I-I-- We had our pictures taken on a coffee mug together wearing T-shirts saying "Caution: We're hot".
So how about a little jealousy for me?
You know what, you're right.
I'm sorry.
I've been such an idiot.
And if I just really stopped and thought, and I just focused on what was real, it--it does kill me that you were with such an amazing woman for so long.
Thank you.
That's all I needed.
You're welcome.
So what was it, Will?
Why her, not me?
I'm going to get the coffee mug.
I told you this.
Because I cared about you and I didn't care about her.
You'd just thrown me out of your house.
So I-I went to this party, loaded up on vodka and Squirt, met her, and had what was apparently phenomenal sex.
The next morning, I-I-I ran to Jack's house and spent the whole day crying and talking about you.
- Really?
- He did.
He was a wreck.
He was crying so hard, he could barely iron his jeans.
The thing with her was a drunken, meananingless night that I only look back on with shame.
It meant nothing to me.
Really?
Well, it meant something to me!
- Huh?
- I remember everything about that night.
How we met at-- at Jenny von Slaniker's "Back From Mono" party.
You were in the kitchen for some reason running the bong through the dishwasher.
I was immediately drawn to you because you were cleaner than everybody else.
then we--we danced to that Dead or Alive song, "You Spin Me 'Round".
And you did, Will.
You spun me right 'round, baby.
Right 'round, like a record, baby!
Right 'round, 'round, 'round!
The girl's a mess.
Well, so's your Birkin bag, honey.
Bad boy, Chompers.
Later when-- wh-- when we made love on my futon, it was so romantic.
My hair was burning on my hotplate, but I didn't care.
How could that be?
I mean, I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
I was scared.
I was fumbling.
I don't even think I took my underwear off.
All I know is it's the only time I've ever had an orgasm.
Ever.
In my life.
What?
!
Well, I-I-I was close that time, but Ed Koch wrecked it.
Isn't it important to you at all?
I mean, didn't-didn't-didn't you take anything away from it?
I-I took one of your Benetton sweaters.
That was my roommate's sweater.
She accused me of stealing it.
We went to student court!
I'm sorry.
I didn't-- Like I told you, I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
I was a basket case.
I still am a basket case!
Excuse me.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah.
This is just where I was hoping this evening was going.
You know, uh, maybe I should check to see if she has an emotionally disturbed brother with the same legs.
Well maybe it's just as well you never did take a ride on the Truman train.
That coulda ruined you for life.
Train?
You had one passenger.
Yes, but at least she got off.
Yeah, at crazy town!
- I'm gonna go check on her too.
- No, no, no, no.
You are mine.
And you're not going anywhere near that woman ever again.
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
What is it about putting metal to cotton that makes me feel like a man?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Leo, be honest with me How do you feel when you see a pillowcase this perfect?
I feel excited, and then sad.
Wait, scratch "excited".
- So, do you have that tennis racket for me?
- Yeah.
Right here.
Never been used.
Bought it a few years ago when I was still hoping that Lleyton Hewitt was a latent homosexual.
I can't believe you guys are playing tennis today.
It's a beautiful sunny day, you should be at the movies.
I know.
I'd love to be inside, but Karen invited me to her country club.
Yeah, I'm surprised Karen belongs to a club that lets Jews in.
Oh, actually, I might have to sign in as Kelly O'Reilly.
Anyway, what are you doing today?
I'm gonna drive to Connecticut, see my mom.
Since the divorce became final, she, you know, sounds a little down.
I'm gonna spend some time with her.
Which show did you buy tickets to as an excuse to get out of there?
Hey, I don't need an excuse.
The fact that I have seats for Mamma Mia with a strict 8:00 pm curtain time is purely coincidental.
Wait, so, so you get a little Mama, and then you get a little Mamma Mia?
Come on, give me another one.
I'm on fire.
Anyway, I'm taking Jack along for company.
And 'cause it's fun when my mother yells at him for touching the furniture.
He cried once.
Oh, it was so good.
Thanks for this.
You guys kiss way too much.
Sorry, guys, can't talk, a lot going on right now, really.
Are my khakis done?
You know what they say, a wrinkled ass is the devil's playground.
Beat that, Hung Lee Dry Cleaners.
You really love ironing, don't you?
I do love ironing.
Okay I might be a little rusty.
The last time I played was at Camp Hasamir Hatzayir.
I won the singles title, and got to try ham.
Yeah.
Honey, feel free to keep the Jew talk down to a whisper.
Hey, guys.
Man, this is a fancy club.
I can't tell whether I was peeing in a urinal or an empty candy dish.
Grace's husband, what are you doing here?
Well, he was gonna play with us.
That's okay, right?
Oh, heh, well I thought it was just gonna be you and me.
- Is there a problem?
- No.
I thought it was just gonna be you and me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just assumed when you invited me that you invited me and my husband.
No, it's fine.
I don't know how to tell you this, but I thought it was just gonna be you and me.
Besides, where am I gonna find a partner at the last minute?
Well, well, well.
Karen Walker Once again single in a doubles world.
Beverley Leslie with your pants so tight, won't you be my partner tonight?
Ooh, I would be honored.
- You think we can take 'em?
- Please between the two of us, we've got eight feet on them.
Okay.
Just a quick stop here, and then back to New York for two hours of Mamma Mia, and a lifetime of trying to get "Dancing Queen" out of our heads.
I'm so excited.
Do you realize we haven't seen it in almost three weeks?
Okay, I went once without you.
I went twice yesterday.
Hello, anybody home?
Hi Will.
Hi Didn't you hear me calling you?
Yeah, I did, but Oh, I figured that if I didn't answer, eventually, you'd find me sitting here alone, so, I didn't want to waste the energy saying, "Hi, 'I'm in here".
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Hello, Jack.
- Hi, Mrs. Truman, I just wanted to say-- - Ooh, don't touch that molding.
There is some kind of, ugh, oil on your hands that, last time, actually damaged the wood.
Isn't it a little dark in here, mom?
Come on, you should open the curtains.
It's a beautiful day.
Oh, is it?
Oh, last time I looked, it was pouring rain.
Boy, time flies when the man you've been devoted to for 40 years says, "Stop calling, you're waking us up".
Now, who wants a glass of chardonnay?
Mom!
You don't drink chardonnay in the dining room at 10:00 in the morning.
You pour it into a coffee cup and drink it in the bathroom.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing's going on.
It's just that the things that seem so important just don't seem so important anymore, you know Impressing the neighbors, keeping up appearances bathing.
Well, for what it's worth, I can barely smell ya.
- You're sweet, Jack.
- Well, I bathe.
Oh, don't sit there!
That chair's for guests.
Mom, I'm worried about you.
You're sitting here alone in the dark.
You-your ornamental gourds are all askew.
And-- And are you not wearing a bra?
Oh, I have it on.
It's just around my waist.
I'm hungry.
I'm gonna go get the rest of that sandwich out of my bed.
Okay, she seems fine.
Fine?
It's like a scene from Grey Gardens in here.
I'm afraid if we leave, she's gonna take a nap at the bottom of the pool.
Hey, my grandmother wears her bra around her waist.
Of course, that's where her boobs are.
Come on, serve!
What, you need a normal-sized person to stand on so you can see over the net?
I'll have you know, people at the club actually talk about my serve!
They also talk about your he/she quality, but that's not gonna win us the points.
Come on!
That's a good sound.
If we can still have children, that was really funny.
Oh, are you okay?
I'm fine, fine.
Must have been her drinking arm.
Ooh, I'm sorry, Grace's husband.
I promise it won't happen again.
Nice shot We win!
Take that, you stupid giants!
- Karen, can I see you for a minute?
- Sure, honey.
Sweetie, can I get you anything?
Uh, maybe just a glass of water.
And-and some tiny crutches for my balls.
What the hell's the matter with you?
!
Why are you harpooning my husband?
"Husband, husband".
Does everything have to be about your precious "husband"?
Ok, I get it.
You just lost Stan, and then I show up with my guy.
This must be incredibly hard for you.
No, that's not it.
No.
Then what is it?
Karen?
Well, you told me about the hit and run, you can tell me.
It's just I hate Leo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Boop.
- What?
- Mm-hmm, hate him.
Hate him, hate him, hate him.
He's dull, he's ugly, and he don't make me laugh.
- Is that all?
- Wellno, honey, but I don't want to say anything more, that would be hurtful.
- Hey, mom, you know what we should do?
- Your father was selfish in bed.
That's right, the vacuum game!
Oh, I love the vacuum game.
But do they make attachments for girls?
Not that vacuum game.
And by the way, you can keep my Dust Buster.
Come on, mom!
- Oh, I can't even remember the rules.
- Of course, you do.
I-I-I vacuum a room, and then you follow me around and critique it.
And every time I did it right, I'd get a fudge brownie.
Every question I've ever had about you has just been answered.
I think the vacuum may have broken when I used it to suck up your father's Rolex.
Great.
What are we gonna do?
She's still a mess!
And if we stay here any longer, we're gonna be late for Mamma Mia.
And you know if you miss the first five minutes, you may as well miss the whole thing!
Hey, calm down, veins-a-poppin'.
I have an idea.
Why don't we bring her with us?
No!
My mother hates musical theater.
I took her to see Les Mis.
She said, "Oh, please dear, in real life, the poor people never sing that much".
- Trust me, she'd hate Mamma Mia.
- Mamma Mia?
Are you boys going to see that?
You know, the woman next door whose son has a meth problem raved about it.
Really?
You want to go?
You-you do know there will be singing?
Oh, I love singing.
Oh wait, they aren't poor, are they?
How could you not like Leo?
Everyone likes him.
Even the woman whose leg he amputated said, "I may have lost a leg, but I gained a friend".
Honey, I told you, he just doesn't make me laugh.
Although, I believe I said it like this.
He don't make me laugh.
Well, obviously, you have no sense of humor because he's funny.
He's like Regis funny.
And if you don't see that, well, then I feel sorry for you.
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hey, what do you know about that?
A knock-knock joke, and Leo's famous for them.
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's there?
You see, I wasn't saying a knock-knock joke, I just entered without knocking, so I said, "knock knock".
You kill me.
Baby, um will you tell Karen what you did the other day at Balducci's in-in-in the produce aisle?
- That was good.
- I know.
- That was good.
- It was, tell it.
- Okay.
- And tell it really funny.
Tell it perfect.
Uh, I decided to make chicken the other night, so, so I was gonna marinate some carrots.
Sweetie, cut to the funny part.
That's not the funny part.
So I'm standing behind this woman who's also buying carrots.
And right before we had a chance to reach for them, she grabs the last bag.
So I said to her, look, could you maybe make an 18-carrot meal instead of a 24-carrot meal?
Get it?
"Carrot".
Like gold?
Yeah.
I got that.
Listen, I'm gonna go "poop".
You could've told that a lot better!
You should have said carrots more, it's a funny word.
Fool!
What-what is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
It's just it's Karen.
Okay, Karen doesn't really like you.
Well, so what?
I don't really like her.
Come on, let's go grab some lunch.
- Well, doesn't that bother you?
- No.
Not everybody has to like me.
Yes, they do.
If people don't like you, how are you supposed to know if you like yourself?
Well, you still like me, don't you?
I don't know.
It's all muddy now.
Why can't she see how fantastic you are?
Wait a minute.
You're concerned about the opinion of a woman whose pet peeves are sobriety and kindness?
You're right.
Who cares what that lunatic thinks.
Everyone else adores you and that's all that matters.
- What about you, Grace?
- I'll get there.
Mamma Mia, here I go again.
My, my, how can I resist ya?
Mamma Mia, does it show again?
My, my, just how much I missed ya.
Whoa!
Boy I can't remember the last time I had so much fun.
Oh yes, that's right, it was right before I walked in on your father holding that hooker up in the air with his legs.
There was something in the air that night, the moon was bright.
Fernando Jack, thank you.
It was a great idea.
I really owe you one.
Well, I don't know why you're so surprised.
For I am a wise man, Will.
A wise man.
Yes, you are.
By the way, that's potpourri.
Or is it brain food for a wise man?
It's potpourri.
Come on, mom, say goodnight to Jack.
I'll drive you home.
Home?
Ugh.
The thought of going back to that house makes me want to stop taking my calcium pills, and throw myself down the stairs.
Come on, we're gonna see each other in a couple of weeks.
In the meantime, think of all the fun you're gonna have with your "Mamma Mia" beach towel, and your "Waterloo" water bottle.
Yes, you're right.
It's fine.
Wait a minute.
Hold on a sec.
Hold the phone.
I'm workshoppin' an idea here.
You could leave, yes.
But what if you stayed?
- What?
- What?
Sure.
Why be two lonely old women rattling around in your stained caftans and shower caps alone, when you could do it together?
- Uh-- W-- Jack, sh-- She doesn't want to stay here.
- Well, I-I-I-I could stay for one night, I-- Or seven.
Or a whole month.
Stay until you feel better, Mari.
She-she already feels better.
Silly, did-did-didn't you hear her singin'?
Jack, before I forget, I think I saw something shiny in the hallway, wanna have a look?
Ooh, I'd love to.
Where is it?
Why are you hiding it from me?
It's right here.
What the hell are you doing?
I can't live with my mother!
Don't you realize the crimp that is gonna put in my theoretical social life?
Shame on you.
That woman suffered through heterosexual sex, and give birth to a bloated lump.
And this is how you thank her?
I thanked her plenty with 30 perfect piano recitals, and long letters from government leadership council.
- Fine!
Uninvite her.
- Fine, I will.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
I-I just think it's best if-if you stay.
Really?
Yeah.
Why don't you go to the linen closet and pick out a duvet with contrasting sheets?
I'm so lucky I had boys.
Anyway, Leo and I talked about it Excuse me, can you not be so stingy with the bagel chips?
And I'm asking as a rich Irish woman.
- Anyway, we talked about it.
And we decided that we don't care if you don't like him.
- Oh, that's fantastic, honey, 'cause I really don't.
Well, I don't care.
More importantly, Leo doesn't care.
That's my high school yearbook.
876 people, all of them like me.
- Leo, what are you doing?
- Listen!
Excuse me.
Maria Ginetti.
Let's see what she wrote "Never change".
You know why she didn't want me to change?
Because she had a moustache?
Because she liked me.
I got a hundred never changes.
I got 300 K.I.T's.
"Keep in touches".
Homecoming king funniest most popular.
Oh look, here I am hosting our school's Night of a Thousand Laughs.
The reviews for that?
I'm glad you asked.
- Leo.
I thought you said you didn't care.
- Well, I do care!
I mean, I-I-I I'm good looking.
I'm a doctor.
I'm funny.
Maybe you don't see it.
But there's a certain entertainment reporter at the Sandy Springs High School Chronicle that just might disagree with you.
- "Not since the Spanish Club's production of El Grande--" - All right, all right!
Enough!
Hey, hey, hey!
You need to cool down, and get me bagel chips.
Okay, what are we gonna do about this?
You see, the thing is if you don't like Leo, we're gonna end up spending a lot less time together.
I mean, I'll-- I'll see you at work.
Or as you like to call it, the sleep-it-off place.
But that's it.
No, honey, that would kill me.
Hey, okay.
How about this?
What if I pretend to like him, just like I do your other husband, Will?
Interesting.
Leo, would, would that work for you?
Let me get this straight.
If anybody asks, or if, let's say you ever have to sign a yearbook, you'd say you like me?
That's great.
So, in effect, everyone really does like me.
All right, then, we're all friends.
On the surface, where it counts.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
What is it about "Smallville" that brings out both the teenage girl and the lecherous old man in me?
It's the writing.
So how's living with your mother?
Think you'll do a Christmas card together?
Maybe you guys and a couple of schnauzers?
Don't remind me.
I spend every minute with her.
Museums, shopping, hair appointments.
In the last seven days we've had eight dinners together.
Don't ask me how.
- Where is she now?
- Well, we had an early dinner.
I sent her off to see Gypsy.
We'll probably get a quick bite later on.
Oh, now I see how that works.
Hmm, interesting.
"Smallville" night.
Oh, I used to be a part of that back in the day.
Don't have time for it anymore.
Why?
Got one-liner in an off-broadway play.
Who are you playing?
A guy that smokes an imaginary cigarette?
Maybe.
Maybe I should talk it over with James Earl Jones.
He's starring opposite me.
Opposite you, or across the street from you?
Here, drink this.
Don't mind me, I'm not even here.
Hello, boys.
Grace, you must have a very understanding husband.
I am going to take a long tub.
But before I do, does anybody have to make?
Will?
I'm good.
I hate when she talks to me like a child.
"Does anybody have to make"?
Oh, shoot, now I do have to make - Honey, I am so proud of you.
Acting in a play with James Earl Jones.
- I know.
One of the greatest large black actors of our time.
How did you do it?
Well, you know, Karen, it's such a crazy story.
There was an open call.
I tried out, and I got it.
I didn't even know you could get parts that way.
Good morning, fellow actors!
Ahh, the smell of an off-broadway theater.
It's always worse than you remember.
Mr. Earl Jones.
I'm Jack McFarland.
I just wanna say what an honor it is to be working with you.
The theater is, well, it's my life, you know.
I live it, I breathe it, I fondle it till it falls asleep.
But more importantly, I respect it.
By the way, do you know what play we're doing?
The Iceman Cometh.
Cometh.
You are outrageous, James Earl Jones!
Filthy and outrageous.
Would it be forward if I asked you to lift me above your head?
- I'm sorry, I hurt my back doing that for Kevin Costner.
- Ah ha.
Yes.
Mr. Jones, I only have one line, but I was thinking of saying it a few times in different accents.
Thoughts?
Jack, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter if you have one line, or 437 like me.
You and I are the same.
Yes, I have two Tonys and most recognizable voice on the planet Otherwise, you and I are the same.
You know, I've always thought that.
But to hear you say it Wow.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You should be at home getting fat.
I know, right.
But ever since Leo's been home, he's just had a lot of extra energy.
He wants to do it like twice a week.
Together.
So I've gotta tone up.
What kind of shape do you have to be in to just lay there?
Good shape.
Anyway, I started with a trainer last week.
You're paying for a trainer?
Is that so hard to believe?
Kind of, you tried to have a cavity filled at a street fair.
That's cute.
Did you think that up while you were living with your mother?
Could you not bring up mother, please?
The gym is the one time of day I have to myself.
Okay.
Just so you know, that was a little Norman Bates-ish.
Oh, okay, I gotta go.
There's my trainer.
What?
That guy over there?
He looks like he's already training that woman.
- Yeah, I train with them.
- Oh, I see.
And do they know that?
Look, why should I pay good money when I could just as well follow these guys around and do the same exercises for free.
Because it's cheap and unseemly.
And yet, I still don't live with my mother.
- How many more sets you have?
- Oh, I'm just getting started.
You wanna work in?
- Thanks.
I'm Andrew.
- Will Truman.
- So, Will Truman, you here alone?
- Will Truman, your mother is at the front desk.
Yes, yes, I am.
- Didn't they just page you?
- Nope, no.
I-I don't think so.
Will Truman, please meet your mother at the front desk.
Will Truman!
Will, dear, are you here?
I'm just a man who's scared of life and even more scared of dying.
So I'm staying drunk and hanging on to life at any price, and what of it-- And you know what real peace means, because you won't be scared of life or death anymore.
You simply won't give a damn.
You're a liar.
Okay, okay, okay.
We're gonna have to stop.
There's only one person that's acting on this stage.
And that's Jack McFarland.
Him?
James, you're not giving me anything.
Well, I have two friends that might disagree with you, Tony and Tony.
Would you like to meet them?
They're in my dressing room.
I've also had two Tonys.
Also in his dressing room.
Who is this guy you're playing?
It's called acting, James.
Let's see some.
Take five, everyone.
Like I need this crap at my age.
I've got Darth Vader money!
"It's called acting, James".
How 'bout some directing, Gordon?
- You okay, honey?
- What?
You think all that bothered me?
I'm fine.
If you say so.
- What?
- Well, uh, can we get real for a second, honey.
You are a big, gorgeous man with a dazzling smile and large sausage-like fingers.
You don't need to act.
Which brings me to my point.
You can't.
What?
You gonna make me bring up my Tonys?
Ugh, enough with those bowling trophies!
Honey, that's an award they invented to keep gay men off the streets for a night.
Let's face it, honey.
You stink.
Now, you haven't done anything good since "This is CNN".
But what about-- Look I-- I was Mufasa.
Mufasa?
Honey, more like Boofasa.
Yeah.
It's bad.
You know, you're right.
You've finally said out loud what I've always feared.
I'm a fraud.
There you go, honey.
Whew, it's out.
Now you can let it go.
You know, I hear they're hiring at Lady Foot Locker.
If I could only be more like that Jack, the way he breathes so much life into one line.
Well you can't compare yourself to Jack McFarland.
- After all, he is one of the foremost acting teachers in this city.
- He's a teacher?
You think I can get into his class?
Eesh, I don't know, honey.
It's like a hundred bucks a month.
But that's exactly what I need.
I haven't been to a class since Lee Strasberg.
I sat between Marlon Brando and Shelley Winters.
Honey, no offense, but how did that bench not break?
Who said it didn't?
- Hey, Will, right?
- Yeah.
Are you here alone, or are you here with your mom again?
- My mom?
Please - Oh, there you are, Will.
I'm borrowing your flip-flops for the shower.
I'm with my mom.
Come on, I don't even need this muscle for sex.
What?
I didn't say anything.
My mother was here.
Again!
Third time this week!
The only person that goes out in public with their mother more is Kevin Spacey.
Tell her it's time to go home.
- I can't.
You should've seen her when we were shammying off the mini-blinds.
She hugged me and said it felt like Christmas came early this year.
- Well, you know, you're gonna have to be honest with her.
It's the only way.
Oh, nice advice, coming from the first woman to steal exercise.
- Okay, let's take a break.
- Ooh, it's about time.
- What?
- Why do you keep "whating" me?
And your shorts are up your butt.
Oh, Grace.
Grace, Grace.
I-I have a little problem.
Can I talk to you about it?
You know, girl to girl.
Um, heh-heh, well, wouldn't you rather do that with Will?
I don't like that kind of joke.
And besides, Will is the problem.
- What do you mean?
- I am dying to get out of there.
He's driving me crazy.
Always including me in his plans.
I swear to God, if I have to get up at 5 A.M. to go to one more flower mart!
Well, you should just tell him that you're ready to leave.
I'm sure he'll be fine with it.
Beyond fine.
I'm not like you, Grace.
I just can't say anything that pops into my head.
And, besides, he is so much happier and regular since I've arrived.
It would devastate him.
- Mom, come on, or we won't get to spin next to each other.
- Coming, son.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to class.
Now, remember, we are guests of the owners of this theater here today.
So if you see any of the owners, hide.
Now, we have a very special friend joining us today.
He is an acting legend, known for such memorable roles as Oh, get out of town!
You did a "Lois and Clark"?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. James Earl Jones of TV's "Lois and Clark".
Make some noise.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Now Let's just jump right into it.
Jiminy, what do you got?
- I did prepare a monologue from King Lear.
- Ooh, tough.
Who would you like to do this monologue with?
Just me.
Uh, all right, it's a little unorthodox, but, hey, I give you points for moxie.
Let's do it.
Yeah, let's see.
Action, please.
- Blow winds!
Crack your-- - Whoo!
And stop!
Stop.
Okay.
Let's start with the voice.
It's fine for a lesbian, but you're a man.
You want to-- You wanna be up here real high in your head voice.
Not down here.
But real high up here, okay, La la la.
- La la la.
- La la la la.
- La la la la.
- A little more nasal.
Nasal, like, lady.
Lady!
Good!
It's all part of lightening up, James.
We gotta lose the James Earl Jones, and find the James Girl Jones.
Now.
We're gonna do a scene from "Sex and the City".
Joanne, would you like to help us?
Great!
I'm still on a high from my Monostat 7 callback.
- Mr. Jones, may I just say I am such a-- - Stop gushing, Joanne, you're a commercial actress.
Okay.
And you're walking with purses.
And action.
- Oh, Samantha, I'm so nervous.
- James, James.
Uh, did you get mugged?
Where's your purse?
Oh, Samantha, I'm so nervous.
Big is in town, and I don't know what to do.
You don't what to do, or you don't know who to do?
Oh, Samantha, you're so terrible.
But those Jimmy Choos are to die for.
James, the voice, okay, Jimmy Choos.
- Jimmy Choos.
- Jimmy Ch-- Up here.
- Jimmy Choos.
- No, it's Jimmy Choo!
Jimmy Choo!
- That's better, excellent, better.
Russell, take your shirt off.
- Why?
'Cause we got a lot of work to do.
Honey, cover up.
I can see you.
Will, can I talk to you for a second?
- What's up?
- Great news.
Your mom's sick of you, and wants to leave.
- She does?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
- No, it's not great.
I'm her son.
Mommy!
Are you sick of me?
- Of course not.
Where did you get such a crazy idea?
- Grace said you said.
- I said no such thing.
- Yes, you did.
And you said you're sick of her.
I did not!
Would I handwash the stockings of a woman I'm sick of?
Grace, what's wrong with you?
You seem to enjoy causing trouble.
Oy, goyim - Well, I don't know what that was all about.
- Me either.
Oh, I hear they're gonna have gerbera daisies at the flower mart tomorrow.
We should get up early.
- Darling, I'm sick of you.
- I'm sick of you too.
I really can't wait to leave.
I mean, if I have to watch one more documentary about an alternative family and pretend to be moved I'm going to jump out the window!
And if you call my doorman oriental one more time, I'm going to have to find a new building.
- Can I go home tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
Why not tonight?
Excuse me.
Are you working out with us?
No.
I don't even know you, Josh.
- Then how did you know his name was Josh?
- Oh, shut up, Carol.
- You know, I don't do this for free.
- Oh, I'm shaking.
What are you gonna do?
Send me to exercise jail?
And P.S., You're not even worth it.
I haven't noticed any changes in my body.
If anything, my ass has gotten bigger.
That's because this work out is designed to make Carol's butt larger and her chest smaller.
Oh, dear God.
What have I done?
- Honey, this is so exciting.
In five minutes, that curtain is going to go up.
And you're going to make your big debut!
- I know Anyway, I should get home.
Wait!
Karen, I need your support.
I'm really worried about James Earl Jones.
He has made no progress at all.
A week in my class, and his hair looks exactly the same.
Have a good show, Jack.
He can't even do that.
Oh, honey, this isn't one of those shows where everyone wears a hat?
- James, you were amazing tonight, amazing!
- I know.
I already called my family.
It was only five cents a minute.
- Mr. Jones.
Hi.
I'm a friend of Jack's, and I just wanted to tell you, that you were brilliant.
- That's very kind of you.
But no, I will not record your outgoing message.
Hey, J-Jo.
Nice work out there.
Listen, uh could I ride on your shoulders for a few minutes?
Oh, all right.
I'll go change into my Juicy Couture sweats and meet you in front of Sardi's.
Jack.
I got to thank you.
That week in your class really helped me.
Got me back to basics.
You got me to the place where I knew nothing about acting.
Because you know nothing about acting.
Well, you're welcome.
So, I'll see you tomorrow in class.
We'll be doing selections from L'Oréal commercials, okay, so bring a wig.
- Actually, you won't.
I'm leaving your class.
- Oh.
Okay.
So I'll see you here tomorrow night at the play.
Actually, you won't.
I had you fired.
You're a lovely person, Jack, but I'd rather share the stage with a dashboard bobblehead.
So, in future, let's all remember the words of that great Dane, "the purpose of playing, was and is to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature".
Great Dane.
Yeah, right.
Like a dog can hold a mirror.
Will, what do you think?
- Not bad ?
- Yeah, they're great.
Where did you get them?
Your closet.
We're the same size, isn't that cute?
I guess it's only fair.
I used to try your new clothes when I was a kid.
Listen, we should go.
But you know what we Let's start having a regular lunch or something.
I would like that.
More "us" time.
My ankle!
You can still walk on though?
Please!
What do you know two to five more weeks of "us" time!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hey, big news, Will!
I've discovered a universe where your egg-headedness is celebrated and your feta cheese thighs are overlooked.
It's the gay spelling bee.
A gay spelling bee?
Can we do that?
What happened to the policy of "Don't ask, don't spell"?
No, silly.
It's a real spelling bee.
With gay contestants and gay words.
Like "flounce" "hydrangea" "set design by" Come on, I need a coach!
Sorry, Jack.
I'd love to, but my mom's still here.
I can't leave her.
Oh 'Cause you're gay?
No!
Because she hurt her ankle, because she's in a wheelchair.
And what you said.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Leo.
You're tall, with girlish lips.
You want to coach me for the gay spelling bee?
You know I'd love to, but my voice is still a little bit hoarse from the bisexual hog-calling contest.
Grace is sick.
I just came by to pick up some of Will's magical consommé.
Well, where am I gonna find a coach?
Heigh-ho!
- Oh, hey, Kare, would you-- - Sure.
- But you don't even know-- - Sounds great.
- But if I told you-- - Come on, let's get started.
You'd think Karen would have learned her lesson.
It's the same way she wound up becoming husband number eight to Elizabeth Taylor.
So Grace still isn't feeling well?
I thought food poisoning was supposed to be, like, a 24-hour thing?
It is if you stop eating the shrimp.
- Well, why didn't you just throw it out?
- I did.
The soup's almost ready.
I just have to, um.
Could you just turn away for a minute?
Why?
My secret ingredient.
And I don't like people to know.
Okay.
You can look.
Ooh!
I just realized I have the perfect container.
Heat-resistant Tupperware.
You have a really full life, don't you?
Yeah, but I'm about more than just consommé.
do a savory corn chowder and a ginger carrot that's won awards.
In my own personal soup contest.
See, you're not just about being a lawyer.
You--you have your soups.
I don't have a soup.
What's going on with you?
I don't know.
I I mean, I gave up Doctors Without Borders to be with Grace.
And--and it's great.
I-I just, uh I-I miss it sometimes, ya know?
Well, it's an adjustment.
You haven't been back that long.
You're still getting settled.
Big cast changes at Thoroughly Modern Millie We're all a little off.
Yeah, but, you know, they made me an offer.
They, uh, want me to come over to Cambodia and set up a clinic.
It's a six-month commitment.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't do that, 'cause Grace will freak out.
I-I know, but I can't turn it down.
I mean, I miss the excitement.
Here there's no civil wars, there's no cholera, there's no epidemics.
There's--there's nothing to do!
Nothing to do?
Look, if you can say that, then you don't know this city, my friend.
You give me 24 hours, I'll show you Will Truman's New York.
And you will never want to help a person ever again.
God, that would be awesome!
- Come on, let's go.
We'll drop this off to Grace, and then we will hit the town.
- What about your mom?
I'll just double her medication.
If I play my cards right, I won't have to see her till next Thursday.
Here's your bagel.
I put it in the toaster oven so the cheese and muscle relaxants could get all nice and melty.
Finally, a healthy breakfast that tastes good.
Okay, sit down.
Come on, let's get started.
Okay.
Ooh, this is so exciting!
Prepping for the gay bee.
My brain is buzzing with knowledge.
Okay!
Your first gay word is "daiquiri".
I quit.
Let's turn on the TV and watch a Hilton sister milk a cow.
Come on, Jack.
"Daiquiri".
Visualize it.
Okay, now, we're at our favorite leather bar.
There's a sign in the corner which reads, "If you're wearing a harness, daiquiris are free from 5:00 to 6:00".
Do ya see it?
I don't.
Wait till the fat queen moves.
Okay, now I see it.
Now spell it!
D-A I can't see it, the fat queen is back.
Spell it!
D-A-I-Q-U-I-R-I.
Ha!
Honey, you got it!
Spelling is so hard.
It's not nearly as glamorous as it looks in the movies.
Let's cut through the bull.
If you want to win, we're gonna have to cheat.
So I'll write 30 words on my left boob and 32 on my right.
What?
It's a little bit bigger.
And that's normal.
No, Karen!
You can't write the answers on your boobs!
Why not?
It's the only place in a gay bar that nobody's gonna look.
No!
That would be cheating.
It would besmirch the reputation of gay spelling bees organized by drag queens in filthy tranny bars everywhere.
All right.
I guess I respect your integrity.
Now come on!
Let's get back to work.
Ooh, here's a good gay one.
"Doily".
Doily?
Doily.
Doily.
Doily.
Could you use it in a sentence?
He went doily down the street.
Oh, doily.
D-O-I-L-Y, doily?
High tea at Bergdorf's.
You are in for a treat.
And you thought the personalized makeovers at the Kiehl's counter were exciting?
I-I think you're maybe mistaking my allergic reaction for excitement.
Well, at least we're sitting down.
Who can shop for shoes for four hours?
I know.
Usually you need a whole day.
Hey, nice choice, with the Louis Vuitton crocodile loafers.
I'm surprised they make them in your size.
A throbbing stump that cute bus-boy just checked out.
Great.
I was hoping that they'd be guy magnets.
On!
Here's a game I like to play with my mom.
Try to find one speck of crust on these.
You won't.
And good luck finding this kind of excitement in Cambodia.
Are you ready?
And, go-- Leo!
That's two hundred dollars worth of cucumbers and cream cheese!
You're eating like you just got out of prison!
I did!
Four hours in the frickin' shoe department with the salesman telling me I "move well for a man of my size"!
Marco doesn't say that to everyone, okay?
The only other big man he's ever said that to is Cedric the Entertainer.
Will, I gotta be honest with you, man.
This isn't workin' out, you know?
Except for that one moment in the dressing room where that woman lifted her top in front of us because she assumed we were both gay, it's been kind of a bust.
Wh--?
You don't like Will Truman's New York?
I find it a bit fussy.
You're right.
This is the wrong approach.
Where's your New York?
Well, it's not here.
And to address your evening plans, it's not waiting outside Joe Allen's for Liza Minnelli to come out either.
The word is "DeGeneres".
DeGeneres?
Can you use it in a sentence, please?
I like Ellen DeGeneres.
D E-G-E-N-E-R O-U-S?
Oh, God, karen.
I'm next.
- Yeah.
- I don't know if I can do this!
I mean, look around.
These are the best homosexual spellers from 14th through 23rd Street.
Honey, I know how you feel.
I once had to spell my last name for a cop.
It's a lotta pressure.
You're right.
I just--I just had a little crisis of hope and faith-- starring Kelly Ripa, Fridays at 9:00 But, uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Thanks.
And thanks for believing in me.
Oh, you're welcome.
Contestant 12 to the dais.
Excuse me.
Hags must stand ten feet back from the stage.
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry, I forgot about the Grace Adler ordinance.
I'll be right over here.
The word is "taffeta".
Taffeta.
Could you use it in a sentence, please?
I like taffeta.
Thank you.
Taffeta, T-A-F-F-E-T-A, taffeta?
Correct.
Yes!
All right, Rangers!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah, that was exciting.
Maybe we can keep the beer on our own laps.
Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
Let's go, Rangers!
Sorry, I just assumed they'd stop while we were clapping.
No.
Oddly, they play all through our clapping.
Pass!
Pass!
Come on, pass, you--you hot French-Canadian god!
Too far?
No, no.
Drunk, belligerent hockey fans love a gay catcall.
Oh, great.
Well, that was a good game.
A little long, but fun.
That was just the first period.
Oh, good.
I got confused.
At Beauty and the Beast on Ice, the buzzer means one of the utensils fell.
But good, good, good!
More hockey fun.
Bloody tooth in my soda.
Will, I gotta go.
Oh, Thank God.
'Cause this guy's hot dog burps are so strong, I could spread mustard on 'em.
No, no, no.
Cambodia.
I-I think I gotta take that job.
No, you don't.
So just put it out of your mind.
Just focus on the game and the fun we're having.
Let's go, Strangers!
Let's go, Strangers!
Let's go-- It's, um it's--it's Rangers.
And, uh, the clap you're doing is from West Side Story.
Thanks for trying.
Come on, Leo.
Think of everything you've got here.
You can't go again, you just can't.
I'm sorry, man.
I-I-I gotta go.
I don't know what else is gonna help.
Maybe I'll just get myself a helmet full of ice cream.
Don't make it hard on your boyfriend.
Let him go.
If he loves you, he'll come back.
No, we're-- We're not together.
Really?
Can I buy you a light beer?
Do you really have to go all the way to Cambodia?
Couldn't you just find a Cambodian family in Brooklyn and give them flu shots?
Will, if I stay here when I don't want to, I'm just gonna end up resenting Grace.
What's a marriage without resentment?
How do you expect to raise creative kids?
I thought you'd be happy to get rid of me.
I mean, then you'd get your girl back.
Oh, please, that's the last thing on my mind.
Late nights sitting on the sofa, eating popcorn, watching bad TV.
Ooh, when are you leaving?
Because tomorrow night they're showing outtakes of "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica," where he comes this close to hitting her.
I gotta go talk to Grace.
Maybe I'll put her in a good mood by digging some shrimp out of the trash.
How are you gonna break it to her?
I don't know.
I was thinking I could start with something like, - "Grace, this isn't really about you--" - And you just lost her.
Here, let me help you.
Try something like this.
"Grace, if you knew that I was in a place where I was unhappy, you'd want me to leave that place, right?
And go to someplace where I was happy".
Ooh, because if she says no, it's like she wants me to be miserable.
Exactly.
That's the key in dealing with Grace.
You've got to rhetorically box her in, then you can work her like a puppet.
Okay, okay.
So, so I'll open with, "Grace, you want me to be happy, don't ya"?
Trust me, then she'll say, "More than anything, Leo".
And when she says that, I'm home free.
How ya feelin', honey?
I brought you some consommé.
You're the best husband in the whole world.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
Grace, you want me to be happy, don't ya?
Not if it affects me negatively in any way.
--O-W, J-O-B.
Eyebrow job.
D-I-R-R-R-T-Y.
Christina Aguilera's "Dirrrty"?
--H-I-S.
Mom, I don't know how to tell you this.
The word is "GQ".
Did you say GQ?
Congratulations.
You've made it to the final round.
Okay, Jack, since your opponent broke down while spelling "disinherited" if you get this right, you will be our champion.
The word is "maitre d'".
Uh, that's not a gay word.
Of a roller disco.
Maitre d'.
M-A M-A M-A-- Do you know what it is?
Oh, uh, excuse me, waiter.
I would like some tea.
I-T!
Wait a minute.
Karen, those almost sound like letters I'm sorry.
Hag Number 12, you're gonna have to leave.
Hey, get your paws off of me!
Who do you think you are?
!
"R"!
- M-A-I-T R - Eeee!
A mouse!
Eeee!
Would you keep her out of here?
!
No!
Jack!
Without my help, this could end in a catastra-postrophe.
Mom?
You up yet?
Okay, two more days, then I'm coming in there to check on you.
Here's your Tupperware.
Well, you didn't have to bring it right back to me.
Then how come you made me leave my driver's license?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you knew I wasn't giving it to you forever.
Do did you talk to Grace?
What did she say?
She was great.
I'm gonna go.
Well, good for you.
And don't you worry about her.
She'll be a bit of a mess, but I'll take care of her.
That's what I do.
That's what I've always done.
I'm her rock.
Actually, Will, she's coming with me.
What?
!
Grace in Cambodia?
!
She thinks the Khmer Rouge is make-up.
She understood why I had to go, and we don't want to be apart, so she's comin' for the whole six months.
What?
!
But you're not leaving for a while, right?
I mean, I need a chance to get used to this.
We leave in three days.
What?
!
She's never been away from me that long!
She'll never hold it together without me!
You can come with us, if you want to.
No, thank you.
No.
One of us has got to stay here and be the rock.
Well, look who it is.
My supportive friend and spelling coach.
Got anything written on your freakishly tinier boob?
It's only smaller when it's scared.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I tried to make you cheat.
And I'm sorry you lost.
The only thing I lost tonight was your faith in me.
I know.
I screwed up.
I just-- I didn't want to see you devastated.
Well, shame on you.
Shame on you for perpetuating the stereotype of the weak gay man who's reduced to hysterics under the slightest bit of stress.
She's leaving!
Oh, my God, she's leaving!
It's okay.
It's okay for you!
I know, honey.
It's terrible.
It's just like saying that certain religious groups are cheap.
There's my penny!
I'm sorry, honey.
I just wanted you to win so badly.
Well, that's no excuse.
There are more important things in life than winning.
But I wouldn't know what they are.
Because I won!
- Shut your pansy pie hole!
You did not win!
-I did!
What?
!
Um, 105 bucks I won Travel Scrabble.
And this trophy, which I can only keep overnight because they need it tomorrow for the shemale egg toss contest.
Honey, how did you do it?
Did you spell maitre d'?
No!
No one could.
Not even the judge.
And he's a maitre d'!
They went to a bonus round.
But the other guy couldn't get "erect".
I, however, could.
Hey, pukey.
How are you feelin'?
Just a little nauseous, just a little achy.
I'm so tired I could barely lift my head up.
Yeah You're fine, aren't you?
Don't tell Leo.
If I stay in bed, he'll have to pack for me.
Can I get in?
Okay, but before you do, I just wanna say that we are not gonna do this big emotional good-bye with the tears and the blah-blah, like gross people do.
Of course not.
That's not us.
Plus, what's the big deal anyway?
Six months, it's nothing.
It'll go by like a Drew Barrymore marriage.
Wouldn't that be closer to eight months?
What?
!
No, no, not gonna do this.
Eight months.
It's nothing.
You think I'm doing the right thing?
I think you have to try.
I mean, you've tried everything else.
So what are you going to do in Cambodia?
You know me.
Yeah, I know you.
And I'm still wondering what you're gonna do in Cambodia.
Oh help dig a well work around the clinic hit the outlet stores.
I think there's a Ralph Lauren there, five miles from where they actually make the clothes.
Oh, remind me, I'll give you 20 bucks.
You can pick me up 300 or 400 Polo shirts.
What's gonna happen with Grace Adler Designs while you're gone?
Got someone to finish up with my clients.
And I found a replacement to wake up Karen every day when it's time to go home I guess you're all set.
I guess so.
- And we didn't even get all gross about it.
- No, we didn't.
I should get going.
No, don't go.
Everybody okay in here?
Yeah.
Can Will spend the night?
Sure.
Why not?
I knew it was just a matter of time.
When did you shave your legs?
That-- That's me.
I'm gonna miss our little girl.
Yeah.
Hope she'll be okay.
Ah, she'll be fine.
Grace is a lot smarter than we give her credit for.
Welcome aboard flight 15 to Phnom Penh.
We will now begin serving lunch.
Oooh, shrimp.
Yum.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Mom, these pantyhose are shot.
I'll stop by the drugstore and get you some more later on.
Oh, while you're there, will you get something for that itch I told you about at breakfast?
I'm way ahead of you.
I've already cut out a coupon.
Someone please kill me.
Hey, Wilma, I need your help.
Remember Lorraine Finster, the dame who stole my husband and tried to bump me off?
Well, I think I found her.
Private Dick said he dug up an "L.
Finster" at the Hotel Knickerbocker.
Come on, let's go down there and give her the what for.
As much as I love to put on a trench coat and go looking for your grip on reality, I can't.
I have to take care of my mom.
Oh, how sweet.
A gay man living with his mother.
Would you like me to preheat the oven, or you wanna just jump right in?
Oh, hello, Karen.
You know, I took your advice about overcoming pain with visualization.
And you were right.
So I'm just gonna throw these painkillers away.
I'll throw them away for you.
Right in the trash - Mom, what are you doing?
- Oh, I want to go out to the terrace.
I need some fresh air.
Well, let me help you.
- Oh, no, I don't want to be a pain, honey.
- You're not a pain.
The doctor said you're very fragile right now.
And you have got-- To take-- --it easy.
Careful, Baby Jane.
Will, why is she calling you "Baby Jane"?
Is that a gay thing?
Am I a horrible person if part of me wishes that when I go outside, there's just an empty chair?
Enough with that!
Remember Lorraine, the husband who stole my dame and tried to bump me off?
Private Knickerbocker says she's at the Hotel Dick!
Let's get her!
I can't, I told you.
I've got to wheel mother through the park this afternoon.
And then later on, I'll be scattering the ashes of my sex life in the Hudson.
Hey, guys, look what I got.
I put together a care package for Grace.
You know, so she knows we're thinking about her while she's far away.
Do you have her address in Pittsburgh?
- She's in Cambodia.
- Ooh, sounds like a lot of stamps just to mail a condom.
Oh, enough of that.
Jackie, I need your help.
Remember Lorraine, the dame who stole my bump and tried to husband me off?
- Well, the Finster hotel is private dick-n-knockers.
Wanna come?
- Sure!
- Ooh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't even see you there.
- Oh, that's okay.
Mother?
Are you okay?
Didn't even wake her.
She's a stickler for getting her 20 hours.
- Well, I--I wasn't even paying attention.
- He has the unenviable task of being my caretaker.
- Oh, I'm sure he doesn't mind.
- No, I do.
I'm Tom.
And this is my mother, Ruth.
Well, I-I-I'm Will.
And this is Marilyn.
She's my mother.
Although people say we look like sisters.
That was stupid.
I don't know why I said that.
I thought it was funny.
I love your wheelchair.
- Thank you, I, uh, I rented it.
- Is that a Roll King 2000?
Well, if the Roll King is the cheapest one made, then yes, it is.
Take a nap, mother.
You know, you can make Marilyn more comfortable by getting her some adjustable foot pads.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Wh-where would I find something like that?
- There's this cute little hospital supply store in Tribeca.
I could write it down for you.
- Great.
Thank you, th-that sounds great.
Okay, I'm gonna get my lemonade.
You boys keep flirting.
Mom, we're not flirting.
Are we?
I was.
Your mother's adorable.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, yours too.
She's my best friend.
- Do you think that's weird?
- No.
No, no.
No, I feel the same way about mine.
- That's so good to hear, because so many guys I meet, it's like their mothers are impositions.
It's such a turn-off.
- They sicken me.
Our mothers gave us life.
They nourished us.
They were our dates to the prom.
Oh, I-- Listen, th-th-the greatest tragedy of my life was the day they yanked me from the breast of that saint.
Heh If it's possible, you just got 10-percent cuter.
Will, I saw a hobo who looks like your cousin Kathy.
Would you go over and ask her if she is.
Well, we'd better get going.
I'm perming Ruth's hair this afternoon.
- Oh, you're kidding.
I'm doing Marilyn's hair.
- Oh, you're not getting near Marilyn's hair.
- Will we see you here tororrow?
- Absolutely.
We're here every day.
- We are?
- Yes, we are.
She's very forgetful.
Older than she looks.
Had a lot of work done.
Here it is, Jackie.
Room 518, Lorraine's room.
Ha-ha!
We got her now!
So, what are you gonna do when you see her?
Hm.
I've dedicated my entire life to finding her.
But I haven't really thought this through.
Well, let's see.
Lorraine is from England.
So if you really wanted to hurt her, you could hold her down and make her watch the American version of anything British.
Or-- Or-- I could do to her what she did to Stan.
Have sex with her until she dies!
Yep, that's what I'm gonna do.
Open up, Lorraine!
And put on a condom!
Huh, guess she's not here.
Well, we'll just have to wait until she gets back.
And as your friend, Karen, I want you to know that I will wait with you for as long as it takes.
I am hungry for so string cheese.
I may or may not be back.
Hey, if you do come back, will you pick me up a Little Debbie?
Oh, you love your Little Debbies.
I do, Jackie.
I really do.
And I thought I was gonna have to leave the hotel to do my sightseeing today.
- Hey, beanpole.
Give me an alley-oop.
- And what's the matter?
Have you lost your key?
No, just prefer going in this way.
Well, look, if you want me to help you, you've got to tell me what you're up to.
Okay, look.
The woman in that room wronged me something bad.
Now I'm going in there to sex the life out of her!
I thought it was something like that.
I'm not sure how high I'm gonna be able to lift you.
My shoulder's a bit wonky-- Vietnam.
Oh, terrible war.
So many manicurists lost their shops.
This happened last May.
I was shot by a hooker.
- Good morning.
Enjoying your stay at the Knickerbocker?
- Very, very nice, thank you.
You know, these hallways are rather narrow.
I had to walk right over this man.
Whew, that was close.
Okay, get me up here!
Oh, no, it's not gonna work.
There's no tall British guy on this side.
Well, that-- Perhaps I can help you there.
- Hey!
How'd you get that key?
- Well, it's my room.
- But you're not Lorraine Finster.
- No, I'm her father, Lyle.
Hello.
- Come on, mom.
We're gonna be late.
What are you doing out of your chair?
- I'm walking.
You can finally be rid of me.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, this is not good!
No, you are--you are right at the crucial point of your healing process.
You could set the whole thing back!
- Oh, Will, come on, I'm fine.
- Marilyn, you're not.
- I spoke to the doctor.
- I want a second opinion from someone who says that you gotta stay in the chair.
For god's sake, will you just ask him out?
You don't need me.
I do need you.
Right now the thing that Tom likes best about me is how much I pretend to love you.
Yes, honey, but I get stuck with the mother.
I mean, she's 120.
She was a nurse at the battle of Gettysburg.
No, I can't do it!
I cannot possibly think of one more thing to say to that old bag of bones.
So, you still feel the arthritis, even though you no longer have the leg?
You're her father?
I can't believe that bitch has a father.
Well, the bitch does.
Would you like some-- Would you like some tea?
- No, I would not like some tea!
- Would you like some scotch?
- Yes, I would like some scotch!
So, where is she?
Where's Lorraine?
You can't expect me to tell you that.
You told me yourself that you were going to kill her with your sexual powers, I mean-- What sort of a father would I be if I just handed her over to you?
All right, then.
I'll find her on my own.
- Or-- - Or what?
Or we can make an arrangement.
Perhaps for every kiss you give me, I could give you a piece of information.
That's outrageous!
You must think I'm a common whore!
So, do you want my top on or off?
Well, I'm a gentleman.
So why don't you keep it on, and I'll rip it off?
Do you know where she is?
Yes.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Didn't you just say you knew where she was?
Yes, I did.
Wait a minute.
You have no idea where she is.
You're just scamming me so I'll keep kissing you!
Aren't you?
Yes, I am.
I can't believe I fell for this.
You and your daughter are both the same.
Tall British men with moustaches that tickle when we kiss.
Look at 'em over there.
Partners in crime.
Thick as thieves.
Don't you wish you had a camera?
I imagine Ruth's very photogenic.
She was stunning in your prom photo.
It's a wonderful age.
I can't wait to catch up to her.
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older And we wouldn't have to wait so long - That was fun.
- Yeah.
Tom, your mother's partial's come loose.
I didn't know.
My hands just aren't clean enough.
Thank God for Purell.
Maybe if she'd stop talking for five minutes, it'd stay in.
"Oh, look at my pretty hair.
Do you like my pretty hair"?
Please.
I've got potatoes with prettier hair.
- Marilyn?
Mother thinks you're such a good listener.
- Oh, well, I'm just in love with her.
So, Tom-- I'm thinking, what about dinner tonight?
We'd love to.
Have you been to Serendipity?
Mother just loves how soft their entrees are.
I was thinking maybe more just you and me.
Oh.
Leave her?
On Jiffy Pop night?
You know what?
Let's do it.
Let me just run it by the general.
Uh, hello, Lyle Finster here.
Early this evening, I placed a reservation for a petite Asian lady companion.
Yes, well, I won't be needing her after all.
Yes, I have the confirmation number here.
Yes, sir.
B-X-L-4-9.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for my friend.
A bosomy spitfire?
Big bosom?
Spits fire?
Have you seen her?
Seen her, kissed her, felt her bottom.
Nice, isn't it?
- Lyle Finster.
- Finster?
Finster!
I'm Jack McFarland, nice to meet you.
So, was Karen here?
I have a tasty snack for her.
So did I. But unfortunately, she didn't want it.
You're dirty.
Dirty with a German accent.
Doesn't get any better.
Thank you, I-I-I'm sorry, but your friend isn't here.
I-I-I tried to get her to stay, but unfortunately, she wanted absolutely nothing to do with me.
You see, I am the father of her rival.
- Candy Bergen?
- Lorraine Finster.
I am the father of Lorraine Finster.
Finster!
You're Lorraine Finster's father!
Clever.
Now, you know where Karen is.
Because I have to find her.
I mean, I cancelled Lili for her.
And Rita but that's a whore of a different color.
Forget it!
Karen is my closest friend, and I'm not going to do anything to help you!
You're the enemy!
That's exactly what she said.
But, uh, we managed to negotiate after a series of kisses.
I don't suppose that would work for you, would it?
Don't be so sure.
I wasn't sure about leaving mother alone, but I'm glad I did.
I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant after 5:30.
So, do you really like me, or do you always cut up your date's meat?
I like you.
- Let's do this again.
- I'd like that.
Here's your penne.
I had them double-wrap it.
Mister you know the way to a man's heart.
- Excuse us!
Coming through!
- What happened?
Old lady got hurt.
She was making Jiffy Pop and her wrist snapped.
- Mother?
!
- I was alone!
I wanted popcorn.
My poor mother.
Why did you make me leave her?
This is your fault!
She needed me and I wasn't there for her!
Did-- She-- She just hurt her wrist.
I mean, th-the woman is missing a leg!
She could have died, mother hater!
That's right, mother hater!
And to think I was going to suggest the four of take a disabled cruise together!
Buck up, general!
Freak!
So, lunch tomorrow?
Ah, Oprah.
What are you doing on that horse?
Hello, Karen.
What the hell are you doing here?
How did you find me?
Well, shortly after you left, a queer little fellow turned up with this.
A Little Debbie.
Look, I wanted to apologize for my behavior.
It was wrong of me to mislead you.
But the truth is, I don't know where Lorraine is.
I mean, we've lost contact.
And I was wondering if-- if you and I could look for her together.
- In your dreams, big Ben.
- Well, how about dinner then?
- I've had my dinner.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Raunchy sex in the back of a dirty cab?
- I don't think so.
Look, Karen, I know that you felt something when I kissed you.
You know how I know?
Because unlike a certain Vietnamese person of my acquaintance, you didn't shoot me.
The only thing I felt was revulsion.
And sloppy bridge work.
Look, Karen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
I've let a lot of good women go, and a lot of bad women stay.
And the ones in the middle-- I've been rather mean to.
I'm not a boy anymore.
And it's time for me to get relatively serious with someone that I kind of just met.
So, you're not going to get rid of me easily, Karen.
I'm going to stick to you like bangers to mash.
You're not getting your banger anywhere near my mash.
I'm not interested in you.
Get it?
!
So scram!
All right, I'll leave you this time.
But, um-- Before I go-- Before you go what?
Nothing.
- You all set to go?
- I think so.
Will, darling, I know it's hard for any man to imagine finding romance without the help of his mother, but trust me.
It will happen.
- If it doesn't, I'll just hobble your other leg and start cruising the park again.
- Well, as long as I'm next to an elderly woman with removable parts, I'm there.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Well that was delicious.
And now for the clean-up, enter the crumber.
Someone got a new toy.
I was wondering why we had Saltines and corn muffins for dinner.
Well, I wore out the old one.
This one's Italian.
The American ones are sturdier, but I was feeling sporty.
Italian?
Good luck gettin' parts for that.
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.
- Hey, Gracie!
Jack, it's Grace calling from Cambodia.
- I'm not here.
Hey, how are you?
What's going on?
Are you calling from the middle of the jungle?
Pretty near the jungle.
Ooh, no.
No, no, no.
Nine piece.
This one.
Hey, and don't skimp on the biscuits.
Last time you only gave me one.
I-- What's-- I can barely hear you.
Oh, I'm at the clinic.
It's crazy.
You would not believe the work that we're doing here.
No, original recipe.
- Original what?
- Oh, that's just what we call O-negative blood here.
I help with transfusions.
Well, I miss you so much.
But I'm so proud of the work you're doing.
Have you met Angelina Jolie yet?
Oh, please.
She doesn't have the stomach to go where I go.
Oh, I gotta go.
My order's ready.
Your-- Hello?
Our little Gracie.
Saving the world.
- Yeah.
Where was she this time?
Burger King?
- Sounded more like KFC.
Hi, cuties.
Sorry I'm late.
I have to leave early.
In fact, I just left.
So if you see me come in, tell me I went home.
Karen, did you go to your physical today?
Yeah, I did, uh-huh.
Don't lie to me.
You are on the board of Walker, Inc. now.
You have to prove you're in good health, or at least the black market organs that make you up are in good health.
I went to the doctor.
Here, my x-ray.
Happy?
This is the x-ray of a cat.
She said the same thing to me when I caught her with a bird in her mouth.
I'm scared of the doctor.
That's why I always skip the middleman and go straight to pharmacist.
Karen, you have to go.
Life is hard sometimes.
You can't just crumb your way through it.
So tomorrow, Jack and I are going to take you to the doctor, and that's final.
Come on, Kare.
Waiting rooms can be lots of fun.
I'd like to introduce you to a fascinating new magazine I've discovered.
- What is it, Jackie?
- It is Highlights.
And it is filled with challenging games and puzzles.
I sent a riddle to them once.
Never heard back.
Excuse me, do you know how long we have to wait?
I'm with Karen Walker.
There's no way of telling, sir.
Karen Walker!
Is there a Karen Walker here?
You know how much longer now?
All right, Alice, take care.
See you tomorrow.
Excuse me, doctor.
Maybe you could help me.
It hurts when I do this.
I'm sorry, I'm not a doctor.
Just a student nurse.
Did you say student nurse?
Would you excuse me just for a minute?
Think, Jack, think.
No outlandish claims or crazy invented personas.
Just be yourself.
What a coincidence.
I'm a student nurse too.
Nothin' to be afraid of.
Just take a deep breath and hallucinate pleasant thoughts.
- You're doin' fine, Karen.
- Yeah.
- Nothin' to be afraid of.
Just take a deep breath and hallucinate pleasant thoughts.
Oh, my word.
Honey, look.
This is the strangest looking condom I've ever seen.
Why, what an oddly-shaped penis the doctor must have.
That's a latex glove.
It goes on his hand.
His hand?
You bet it does.
I'm not ready to be a mother.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm Dr. Hershberg.
Uh, before I begin the exam, could you give me a minute?
'Cause I just had to give some bad news to somebody next door.
- Oh, of course, of course.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Of course, if you'd be more comfortable doing it in the room next door, that's okay too.
Damn you, God!
Why?
Damn you!
Any hoozlebees.
Mrs. Walker, how you feelin' today?
Well, scared, but a little better knowing that someone in the next room has just gotten awful news.
Well, listen, Mrs. Walker, this is a routine physical.
You got nothing to worry about.
You are in good hands.
And, dude, I know it's fun, but you are not allowed to watch.
Oh, no, Mrs. Walker asked that I be here.
I'm her attorney, which makes me a lawyer.
Which is just as good as a doctor, no matter what my parents say.
That's cool.
Hey, whose warm lemonade?
It's not mi-ine.
It must be ur-ine.
Get it?
It's a cup of piss.
Doctor, since I have you here, true or false?
Milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner fudge is made.
Yes, that would be true.
Should I be nervous that I don't see any diplomas on the wall?
You guys, relax, I know what I'm doing.
New York Magazine named me one of the top doctors in Manhattan.
And guess who they didn't name.
My lame-ass partner Dr. Joel Frankel.
Hey, Frankel!
Guess who's in here with a patient.
Me, because I'm awesome, and you suck!
No, really, where are the diplomas?
Well, you know, I don't like to put them up because then it's like, "Hey, look at me.
I'm the shiz"!
Oh, Harvard.
I went to Columbia, which is just as good, no matter what my parents say.
Well, let's get this party started, shall we?
Okay.
"Are you currently taking medication?
See attached".
This is the catalogue from Merck Pharmaceuticals.
Yeah, and a map of Mexico.
- Okay, I think I've seen enough.
Why don't you sit it right here?
- Okay.
- And are you ready for the Dr. Isaac Hershberg experience?
- I am.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm okay now.
Okay.
Got it out of my system.
I'm fine.
- Okay, you're sure?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I got an idea.
I got an idea that I'm already regretting.
Uh, Karen-- Doctor, why don't you examine me first?
You watch, and then you'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.
Okay, whatever floats your goat.
Okay.
Eyes, good.
Ears, yes.
Nose.
Oh, brambly.
Uh-uh.
Not good.
Nurse, can you get me the nasal flashlight and also the tiny thingy.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
See, Karen, I remain calm.
Just allow the doctor to do whatever he needs to d-- Here you go, doctor.
Your instruments have been lubed and sterilized.
And so have I. Hey, um, Nurse Sheila.
You-- You were once my nurse at the sperm clinic.
Hmm, I'm not so good with faces.
Drop your pants.
I'll see if it rings a bell.
Thanks for bringing these over so fast.
- I can do it slower next time.
- No, I like it fast.
- I'll bet you do.
- I like a guy with a little meat on his bones.
- More cushion for the pushin'?
- Hey, you said it.
So, uh is Dr. Frankel free?
You should go.
If she weren't my sister, I'd be tapping that ass big time.
Doctor.
Your professionalism has won me over.
I will consent to a physical examination.
- Fantastic.
You mind if I get stoned first?
- No.
Hello, my large-breasted friend.
Hello, Karen.
What happened to you?
When we left the waiting room, you were busy with your Highlights magazine, still trying to find the toaster in the tree.
Doh!
The tree!
It's the one place I didn't look.
And yet it was circled by the five-year-old before you.
Where did you go?
Well, while I was waiting, I met student nurse Clark.
We started talking.
Then there was some flirting.
Little over the smock fondling.
And then you can probably guess what happened next.
- A lawsuit?
- Under-the-smock fondling?
Yes, and nursing.
I enrolled in nursing school.
And you know the best part?
- You need money?
- I need money!
Tuition for the first semester is $2,700, so I'm gonna need a check by the end of the day.
So how 'bout you give me the money, and in return, I make one of my trademark adorable expressions.
Oh, Jackie, I love that expression.
Hey, you know what other expression I love?
When I say no, and you start to cry.
No.
- What?
- I love it, I love it!
- Will, are you hearing this?
- I am, and I'm not giving you any money either.
How dare you?
!
Nursing is my passion!
All my life I've searched for my true calling.
And this is it.
Nursing!
And if you can't support me, you are dead to me!
No, not dead, because a nurse takes an oath to prevent death.
You have cramps that won't go away.
And you have a smattering of adult acne.
Good-bye!
We're gonna give him the money, aren't we?
Oh, honey, we have to.
It's what we do.
We're Will and Grace.
Now, come on.
Sit next to me on the couch, and we'll dry hump.
Will.
I got the results of my physical back, and I'm a-scared to open 'em.
Will you look for me?
What, you're afraid they're gonna find some blood in your alcohol?
Dear Lord, if I'm okay, I promise I will dedicate the rest of my life to serving you.
It says here you're fine.
Ha-ha, fall for it again, God.
Yup, you punked the Almighty.
They just want you to start taking some calcium.
- How come?
- Well, you know, when you reach a certain a-- A woman of your-- You know, when you're in your f-- Rich people need calcium.
I don't like it.
Well, tough.
You have to take it.
Karen!
Come on!
Just pretend it's one of your Mexican tic tacs.
What are you, some kind of calcium pusher?
Trying to get me hooked on calcium so you and your calcium-crazed friends can make me dance like a calcium monkey?
Fine, I'll just take my stash back to the schoolyard and prey on kids with bad posture.
- Hello, you gorgeous gay man.
Hello, Will.
I got big news.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Us first.
Honey, we called the nursing school.
And we paid your tuition for the entire semester.
And we got you your uniform and a pack of blank prescription pads.
Well, half of a pack.
We felt bad that we were so negative about your interest in nursing.
It was a knee-jerk reaction, because almost everything you've ever taken an interest in is, you know, stupid.
Aw, well, thank you.
That's so nice.
But I'm through with nursing.
Okay?
And my new calling, surfing.
- And I'm gonna need a check for $1,600, okay?
- What are you talking about?
!
We just spent $27 million on your nursing career!
Oh.
Then why am I yelling?
Because we spent the afternoon looking for white Rockports and smocks with tumbling kitties on them.
You get nothing.
How dare you!
Surfing is my passion!
All my life I've searched for my true calling.
And this is it!
Surfing!
And if you can't support me, then you are dead to me.
No, not dead, because surfers believe in reincarnation.
Karen, you are a junior sales associate at Walgreen's in Manasquan, New Jersey.
Will, you're her wife.
Good-bye!
So how are we going to work this?
How are we going to get the money back?
I was thinking maybe we'd work a little "good cop, bad cop".
More like good cop, drunk cop.
More like good cop, bad breath.
Hi.
We're wondering if there's a way to get a refund on this semester's tuition for our friend, Jack McFarland.
Jack is dropping out?
Well, don't feel bad.
He was here almost a week.
That's three days longer than he lasted at acrylic nail school.
And five days longer than at jeweled acrylic nail school.
Oh, I can't believe it.
You know, I have worked here longer than I care to say.
I mean, if I'm here one more year, I'm gonna take out everybody in here and myself.
But, you know, Jack is amazing.
He's the most promising nursing student we've had since Pilar Palabunda.
Honey, did you hear that?
He's better than Pilar.
Let's remind ourselves that we don't know Pilar.
So Jack is good?
Well, you know, I know he was only here a few days, but he had such an enormous impact.
I mean, we all loved him.
Student nurse Derek, have you heard that student nurse Jack is dropping out?
No.
They were lab partners.
Derek really hitched his wagon to Jack's star.
Somebody walked in and saw them.
But, you know, we let it slide because of his talent and his aptitude exams were the highest in his class.
Ah, look, beach blanket butt crack.
Well, if it isn't the dream killers.
Kill any dreams today?
Honey, listen, we think you should go back to nursing school.
Oh, really?
Well, that just proves that you don't get me.
My surfer friends get me.
They say, "Hey, Jack, we get you".
Jackie, listen to me.
They loved you.
Yeah.
They put you right up there with Pilar Palabunda.
That's the name you remember?
You don't remember my name, or your own!
But Pilar Palabunda rolls right off your tongue?
Honey, that's only because that's the name I used to beat up businessmen for cash in Chinatown.
- So anyway-- - Jack, Jack.
This is a great opportunity.
This is not like one of your pretend jobs: Actor, choreographer, pirate.
They think you might actually be good at this.
Don't you think I know that?
Don't you think I know I'm good?
Look, say I have found my "calling".
Say I do become a "nurse," okay?
Then what?
I make a steady income.
I pay my bills?
I become a reliable, upstanding member of society?
All of a sudden I'm not me anymore.
I'm my worst nightmare.
I'mI'm you!
Jack, sweetheart.
Please don't worry.
On your best day, you could never be me.
And I'm willing to bet that no matter what dizzying heights you reach in the go-go world of student nursing, you'll always be yourself.
Honey.
I know it's scary.
Hey, when I started working in the corporate world of Grace Adler Designs, I was terrified.
Would she like me?
Would I be good at my job?
And now look at me, honey.
I'm one of the richest women in the world.
Yes, there's no connection.
But if you pause in the right places and emphasize the right words, it sounds very inspiring.
Oh, Kare, if only I could be sure.
- Oh, Karen, it's time for your calcium.
- I don't wanna.
- Oh, just take the damn pill.
- Leave me alone!
Oh, for God sake, give it to me.
Come here.
- Good girl, good girl.
- Jack, do you see this?
You're a natural.
- Well, all I did was give her calcium to make her bones stronger.
- More importantly, you just said "bone" without giggling.
Oh, my God.
I'm growing up.
I said bone without giggling.
Heh-heh.
Bone.
Oh, thanks for helping me, Wilma.
You know, my bones feel stronger than ever.
I smacked a servant today, and instead of just flinching, she fell right to the floor.
Wait till you bite someone.
You're really in for a treat.
Come on, Jack!
You ready or what?
- Hubba-hubba!
- Baby!
- Oh, yeah!
I think I'm gonna like student nursin'.
And finally, a legitimate reason to wear white hose.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You sure you know what you're doing?
Yes.
We learned it in class yesterday.
I've done it on myself, like, a hundred times.
Yeah?
And how many times on your arm?
Oh ho ho!
Will, very funny.
Twice.
Where are they?
Karen went to pick up Grace, like, two hours ago.
Hush, puppy.
Your blood pressure just shot up.
Think calm thoughts.
I'm just excited that she's coming home.
I wish it was for longer than two days, though.
We got a lot of Tivo'ed "Dr. Phil's" to catch up on.
Beautiful, beautiful.
- What, my blood pressure's good?
- I have no idea.
I could see my reflection in this little thing here.
Okay, kids, we're back from the airport.
Now listen, before Grace comes in, I just want to tell you she's been through a lot.
So don't say anything about her brassy red hair and chapped face.
Let's try to be nice, okay?
She's still the same slutty, flat-chested Grace we grew up with.
Ironically, my Aunt Honey made a similar speech when I came back from my freshman year in college.
Yay!
Hello!
- And you stink.
- Oh, sorry.
It's been eight days since I took a shower.
- No running water in Cambodia?
- No.
There's water.
Ya know, of all the Bodias, Cambodia is my favorite.
No, wait.
Zimbodia.
So, come on, come on, come on!
Come in!
Tell us what happened.
Why are you here?
Your message was all garbled.
Something about your mom's 50th birthday party.
That can't be.
Yeah, she guilted me into coming back for it.
"How many times am I gonna turn 50"?
Well, obviously, 25 times.
- Well, we're glad you're back.
And you look great, tanned.
- Oh, it's a rub-on.
Got it at the airport.
I once got a rub-on at the airport.
Or did I give a skycap a handy?
Ah.
All I know is, I made 20 bucks.
I'm so glad to be here.
I hate schlepping those bags around.
That's the one good thing about Cambodia.
The orphans are little, but they can carry a butt-load.
Grace Adler: America's goodwill ambassador.
Oh, man, that anatomy test was hard.
You speak the truth, Arpie.
But our reward is the funnest class of the day, Basic Procedures.
Starring the glamorous Nurse Turner as our teacher.
And if Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds taught us anything, it's that it's so much easier learning from attractive people.
Look at us, huh?
Student nurses.
We're like one big Benetton ad.
Hey, after class, let's go to Benetton, and go, "Hi, billboard much"?
Good afternoon, class.
I'm Nurse Carver.
I'm replacing Nurse Turner for the rest of the semester.
She's decided to run for Miss Universe.
Um, hi.
I'm student nurse Jack.
Uh, I just want to let you know that I'm your key student.
So, um, if you ever forget your key, I'm your guy.
Okay, Student Nurse Ass-Kiss If you're so smart, why don't you demonstrate, on me, how to take someone's blood pressure.
Uh, I didn't know you could do that to a woman, but okay.
- Wrong!
- What?
I have a large, flabby arm.
You have to use the big cuff.
- Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, you were just making me a little nervous-- - Wrong!
- What?
- You have to take my resting pulse rate before you attach the cuff.
Oh, okay.
I'll just-- Right here, and let's just see-- - Wrong!
- What?
Ow!
You give your key to Student Nurse Asian-Girl.
You are no longer the key student.
That's not fair!
You're nothing like Nurse Turner.
She was talented, well-poised, and looked great in a swimsuit.
Sit down.
You know, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but nursing is a life-or-death job.
It demands absolute professionalism.
Nurse Turner had her way of teaching.
And I have mine.
Nowshall I continue?
Or does someone want to see me in a swimsuit?
- I'm sure you would look lovely.
- Wrong!
Oh!
Finally!
A good, old-fashioned, American candy store.
Back in Cambodia, it was all sugar-coated flyin' ants.
A whole bag of those will make ya sick.
Mmm, malt balls.
Eww.
Carob raisin.
This country's not without its problems.
Okay, so after we eat our candy, let's go get some dinner, okay?
Something good.
Because Doctors Without Borders dinner without flavors.
- What's up with dinner?
It's 9:15 in the morning.
- Yeah, but I'm still on Cambodia time.
It's, like, 2:00 in the morning for me.
It wouldn't be 2:00 in the morning.
It'd be--let's see, how many hours is England ahead of New York?
Five.
So it would be, like, 10:00.
But I didn't fly that way.
I flew West.
- It doesn't matter.
They're later, not earlier.
Didn't you cross the international dateline?
- Ooh, "Dateline".
Did you see the Amy Smart interview?
She seemed kinda hip.
Amy Smart?
Don't you mean Elizabeth Smart?
Oh, do I?
Who is Amy Smart?
- The girl from "Project Greenlight".
- Ooh, I hope they bring that back.
- Okay, wait, what were we talking about?
- I don't know.
But somehow we ended up in the crappy jellybean section.
Jellybeans make me mad.
They shouldn't even charge ya for 'em.
I've missed you.
I wish you didn't have to go back.
I can't believe I have to go to the Barneys holiday sale alone.
Is that this weekend?
The Barneys sale's my favorite sale.
I know.
There's something about Cameron Diaz rooting through a half-price bin that just says Christmas to me.
I wish you could stay one extra day and go with me.
- Me too.
- But I guess that's out of the question, right?
I'm sorry, forget it.
I shouldn't even ask.
- Well, I guess I could change my flight.
- Really?
It's just one day.
And don't forget, with the time change, I'd be gettin' there yesterday anyway.
You'd do that for me?
'Cause I'm sure I could find someone else to shame me out of my skintight taste.
No, you need me.
I can't go through another episode of trying to get your Danskin off your man skin.
It is okay, Jack.
She was mean to all of us.
Yeah, by tomorrow, you'll have forgotten all about it.
Easy for you to say, Burnadean.
She didn't punish you by making you dance with a skeleton.
Oh, hey, Poodle.
Hey, united colors.
- Karen, I had the worst day of my life.
- And I had the best!
I just played a super prank on Candi Bergen.
I melted down her Emmys and made 'em into Cable Ace awards.
Karen, I'm in pain.
My teacher was mean to me.
She humiliated me in front of the whole multiracial class.
Poots, I know just how you feel.
I had a tough teacher once.
I was kind of a misfit.
Trying to find my way in '60s London.
And then along came this handsome black teacher.
We called him sir.
He whipped us into shape, and we all grew to love him.
I wish I'd had a chance to thank him.
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume.
- It isn't easy but I'll try - Karen!
Karen!
Karen!
Why do you think Sidney Poitier hasn't returned your calls?
It didn't happen.
Besides, I don't think I could ever grow to love Nurse Carver.
She teased me, she taunted me.
She even threatened to put on a bathing suit.
And Karenshe's heavy.
Oh, when I hear stuff like that, it makes me so angry!
What a rotten day.
I'm gonna go home to sigh.
I hope he's there.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for Nurse Carver.
I'm Nurse Carver.
Oh!
I am sorry!
How rude!
I always forget that men can be nurses.
What do you want?
By the size of your pupils, I'm guessing an upper.
I'm a friend of Jack McFarland's, and I want you to stop picking on him.
Your insults are undermining his confidence.
- Which one is he again?
- Uh, the big sissy who will never amount to anything.
- Oh, yeah, him.
- So leave him alone!
- And what will you do if I don't?
- Well let's just say you're picking on someone I love.
I may have to start picking on someone you love.
Oh, say, two small pugs named St. Elsewhere and Chicago Hope?
!
Where are they?
What have you done with them?
Who's that large Hispanic woman holding them in one hand and today's paper in the other?
Are you shaking in your boxers?
Nurse Carver, I baked you a meat pie.
Karen, what are you doing here?
Oh, I was just having a little chat with your teacher.
I think Nurse Carver has something to talk to you about.
Student Nurse McFarland, great to see you, and excellent work on today's pop quiz.
- But we didn't take one yet.
- Well, I've decided to give you a 90, right now-- In fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and give you a final grade of"A" for the whole semester.
Congratulations.
See you at graduation.
Karen What did you do to her?
Oh, nothin', honey.
Mama took care of it.
This doesn't have anything to do with that photograph I took this morning of Rosario and those two dogs, does it?
Completely saperate.
Now come on, Poodle.
Let's go celebrate your academic achievement the old-fashioned way.
Using Rosario as a toboggan in Riverside Park?
Well, thank God it's winter.
It wasn't as much fun in the spring.
Come on!
You're taking too long.
I wanna see what you bought.
Wh-what do you think?
I think somewhere Dorothy Hamill is skating topless.
Hey, this is not a girl's shirt, okay?
A lotta guys wear shirts like these.
In Japan.
When they go out.
To be mistaken for women.
Okay, here is one thing I know you are gonna like.
Nice.
When did you join the Century 21 team?
No.
It's part of my costume for the Sound of Music Sing-Along.
I'm going as "re".
A drop of golden sun.
I'm impressed.
Somehow you managed to gay up the Sound of Music Sing-Along.
Thank you.
I miss this.
You know, I only met one drag queen the whole time I was in Cambodia.
Patty Rice.
- Hey, here's a crazy idea.
Maybe you could stay one more day and go with me to the Sound of Music Sing-Along.
- No, I-- Could I?
Could you?
I don't know, I mean-- I mean, I guess it's only one more day, right?
So that means I would leave tomorrow and get there today instead of yesterday.
Okay.
Really?
W-w-w-w-w-wait a minute.
Are you doing this because you feel sorry for me?
Because you think I'm lost without you?
'Cause let me tell you something, missy.
I am.
Totally lost.
Will, I want to stay.
You know how much I love the Sound of Music.
And now I've got an excuse to get the blond braids back from Jack.
Great, so you're staying.
Here, go try on one of these velour sweatsuits before they go outta style.
Oh!
Too late.
And yet, you still wear Japanese girl shirts.
Hey, Joanie, it's Will Truman.
Listen, Gracie's gonna call you and change her flight again.
Can you use my miles to upgrade her return to Cambodia to first class?
I want to surprise her.
She what?
Why would she buy a one-way ticket?
Okay, thanks.
Whoo!
What is better than a cup of hot cocoa after riding your maid in the snow?
It's surprising how many people are riding their maids on the Upper West Side.
Well, look who's here!
It's my school chums!
Arpie, Ping, and Burnadean.
Hi, guys.
Oh, hey, Jack.
Oh, you've got some good color today.
We were sledding.
Oh, look at you.
Future nurses.
Oh, the comfort you'll bring.
The people you'll help.
The patients you'll smother to end their suffering.
I envy you.
Hey, so what are you guys studying?
Anything I can help you with?
I can name all the bones in the human penis.
I don't think so, Jack.
Carver gave us, like, four chapters to learn for the test monday.
So, we're going to Ping's house to study.
We're gonna pull an all-nighter.
Bernadean made glow-in-the-dark flash cards, and my mom's making parfaits!
Flash cards?
Parfaits?
Fun!
- Glucose-overdose!
- What's glucose overdose?
Oh, it is nothing.
We did blood sugar in class today.
I missed blood sugar?
I'll probably miss blood salt and blood pepper too.
What else did I miss?
- Well, we did cover the circulatory system.
- Aorta be a law against that!
I don't get it.
It is okay, Jack.
You don't have to come to class anymore.
You are so lucky.
- We miss you, Jack.
- Really?
I wasn't in the way, being the smartest and the funniest?
- We got to go.
See ya.
- Bye.
Oh, Strudel.
Is that why you were dragging your tailpipe all day?
Because you miss school?
I do miss it, Karen.
And I miss my classmates.
I was their Barbarino.
But Nurse Carver was so mean too you.
Maybe she was mean so I would try harder.
Maybe she's the teacher who's gonna make me a great nurse.
Honey now I understand what you're saying.
Nurse Carver is a woman?
So, what do you think?
It was marked down five times.
I either got a really good deal, or there's a big stain I haven't found yet.
Yeah, it's perfect for Cambodia.
You know, whether it's cocktails in a mud hut or just kickin' it in the killing fields.
Hey, it's Vera Wang.
It's Asiany.
So, I just got off the phone with Joanie at the travel agency.
What?
Why--why'd you call her?
Well, she's your travel agent.
And I wanted to surprise you with an upgrade.
- Will, that's so sweet.
- Yeah.
She tells me that you don't have a ticket back to Cambodia.
Oh, yeah, that's-- It's a very simple explanation.
I used her for my outbound flight, and I used someone else for my return because Joanie can't be trusted with a round trip.
That's why they call her "One-way Joanie".
- So, who did book your ticket back?
- Um, I went across the street to her competition Two-way Tony.
- So, do you have a return flight?
- Yes, Will.
I have a return flight.
Satisfied?
- What's the matter with you?
Why are being so-- - Will you stop asking me questions, okay?
!
I'm not going back.
I booked a one-way flight home because it wasn't working there.
And I didn't want to say anything to you because I knew once I said it out loud, it would be real.
There's a problem in my marriage, and I don't know how to fix it.
Oh, sweetie.
I had no idea.
I thought if I went there to be with Leo, I'd be with him, you know?
But he was working all the time.
Once I didn't see him for seven days.
I don't know what I would've done if they didn't have "Cambodian Idol" there.
Anyway, we had this big discussion, and ultimately we decided that the best thing to do was for me to leave.
Wow.
So, what's gonna happen with you guys?
He's gonna finish this assignment.
And when he gets back in the spring, we'll see where we are.
Did that sound mature?
'Cause I'm terrified.
Okay.
I know this seems bad, but you know what?
This could be good.
Because when you guys finally do get back together, it'll be because you both want it.
- You think?
- Absolutely.
Take it from a guy who-- although he hasn't been in a serious relationship for a long time-- has read a lot of romance novels.
This is very positive.
I don't know.
Really.
Look, as soon as you guys get back together, and he tears off his shirt, revealing rippling muscles and a birthmark that proves he's not your brother, it's gonna be great.
I hope so.
By the way, I read that book.
And there's a double flip at the end that proves that he is her brother.
But it's still pretty hot.
- So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna stay out in Brooklyn?
- Of course, it's my home.
- Because I was gonna ask if maybe you wanted to move back in here with me.
- Of course, it's my home.
This shawl is gonna look so good with that shirt I bought.
Hey, Sidney Poitier, it's Karen Walker.
But, uh, you might know me as Lulu.
Yeah, listen, you really need to call me back right away.
I think I might be pregnant.
If that doesn't get him
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for making me go out tonight.
It was either this, or try to finish Joy Luck Club.
That damn book's been staring at me from the bed-side table for ten and a half years.
Well, you need to get out.
I know Leo's gone, but that doesn't mean you have to stop living, or stop-- Can I just do something?
Brushing your hair.
Oh, that subway was disgusting!
It smelled like urine.
Karen, we took your limo.
Oh.
I gotta stop drinking those Big Gulps.
Hey, thanks for taking me out to celebrate my first month in nursing school.
Well, poodle, it's a big deal.
A gay man breaking into the ranks of nursing.
It's like a butch girl playing softball.
You just don't see it every day.
Okay, Chris, my new guy, should be here any minute.
I want you guys to check him out.
I really like him, but I'm afraid he might be a little bit flaky.
Why is flaky such a bad quality in a date, but such a good quality in a crust?
Because you're a pig.
Hey, out-of-work actor!
Walker, party of five.
Walker.
Yes, I have it here.
But I only see four of you.
And I only see two of you.
What's your point?
My point is I can't seat you until your entire party is here.
Uh, here, Karen, let me.
I got this.
This is a five dollar bill.
Yeah.
I'll just take two or three back.
Ma'am, I cannot seat your party until all five of you have arrived.
Chris will be here any minute.
Let's just check our coats.
Good morning, vest!
Uh, mine's the tan Camry with the scratch on the side.
What?
This is totally now.
It's very Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.
It like it.
It's a choice.
Yes, but did you have to choose to be a lesbian comedienne, circa 1986?
Ladies, am I right?
It's okay, I can take it.
The fashion forward have always been ostracized.
I'm sure when Gandhi first put on the diaper, there were some sideways glances.
Who got the last laugh?
That's right, Gandhi.
Ha ha!
It's funny when it walks, too.
Can I get an apple martini, please?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Aren't you--?
Sorry.
- Aren't I what?
- Oh, nothing, it's just that I was watching this movie last night.
And I thought you were the guy from it.
- You're not, are you?
- Actually, I'm not an actor.
But I get that a lot.
Oh, come on, what difference does it make if you seat us now or when our fifth person gets here?
Because we never have four people sitting at a table for five.
"Never"?
Well, what if five guests are sitting at a table, and one gets up to use the restroom?
- Then, you'd be left with four.
- Ah-ha!
Four people!
All right.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to do this.
But I see that I do.
I am a student nurse.
Honey, you're such a big shot.
You're giving me lady wood.
Well, Chris isn't coming.
He said he was too tired to put on shoes, and he was just gonna stay home and watch TV.
Thank God it wasn't something flaky.
All right, this is ridiculous.
We just need one more person.
Excuse me, are you alone?
Yes.
But I do have a lot of friends.
If you want to check my cell phone, there's a ton of numbers.
Okay, don't talk, just hold my hand.
My date's here.
We're ready to be seated.
Leo looks good tonight.
So just, um, sit with us for a few minutes until the maitre d' gets off my ass.
Then, you can return to your night.
Heh-heh - My night?
Please, I was just sitting at the bar trying to get through Angela's Ashes.
- Oh, my God, I know what you mean.
I just finished Joy Luck Club.
What'd you think of the ending?
I'll tell ya later, stood-up.
Um, Karen, we just learned the Heimlich Maneuver in class, and I'm dying to use it.
Could you choke tonight?
- Well, honey You know that I like to support your education, let's try.
- Okay.
No, no.
I'm okay.
No.
Not choking.
- No, no, no.
Still alive.
Nothing.
- Jack, Jack, stop it.
Wh-what're you doing?
Trying to choke someone with olives?
You need fatty pieces of beef, or marbles-- Waiter?
Ah, look at poor vesty trying to join in the fun.
Gimme a break.
I got stood up tonight.
Did you, Mae Vest?
I hope you didn't in-vest too much in him.
Vest.
Karen, that's genius.
It's not even clever.
You're just saying "vest" over and over again.
Can I get another apple martini please?
Hi, handsome.
Sorry, it's the Pinot Grigio talking.
Italian wines are so chatty.
But be careful when they walk past you, they'll pinch your ass.
Ugh, I'm at this awful birthday party for my boss.
She yelled at me for an hour for putting regular milk in her coffee.
And now, she's licking whip cream off a male stripper.
Hello?
Are you allergic to dairy or not?
- That is quite a dichotomy.
- Ooh, dichotomy.
Hi, smart.
Stephanie.
We're about to cut the cake.
Don't make me wish that bitch a happy birthday alone.
Hey, would it be cool if I came out to talk with you in a little bit?
- Sure, why not?
- Great, I'll be back in ten minutes.
Make sure you're still cute.
Like people can control that.
That maitre d' is still watching us.
I think he's obsessed with me.
Can you blame him?
Oh!
Look, there I go saying that thing I'm thinking.
That's okay.
I love it when people compliment me.
Ooh, see, I did it too!
- You have the most incredible smile.
- I don't.
- I feel like I've seen it before.
- In Flemish paintings?
No.
In a basement of a bar on Amsterdam.
Have you been to Grapes?
Uh Yeah, a couple of times.
Every Saturday night of my early 20s.
Uh-huh.
I think we made out.
A-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I-I think I'd remember that.
It's not like I made out with every-- Wait, did you have a ponytail?
- No.
- Then I probably did make out with you.
Oh, my God, Karen, isn't that Candice Bergen, your arch-enemy-slash-best-friend?
Oh, my god.
This is a nightmare-slash-delightful.
Hello, Ms. Bergen.
Hello, Walter.
I know I booked a table for five, but the other four crapped out on me.
They had to go see Blue Man Group.
Apparently, it's only playing another four more years.
No problem, Ms. Bergen.
We'll seat you right away.
Oh, she always gets what she wants.
Damn that Candy-ass Bergen!
Say, Walter, how's your boyfriend?
Did he get that diamond broach I sent him?
I remember you telling me he likes pins.
He loved it.
And I loved the diamond tiara you sent me.
Well, I remember you telling me how much you like prancing around like a queen.
- Your table will be ready in a few moments.
- Thank you.
Oh, I hope she didn't see me.
We're in a little bit of a war.
See, I crank called her and pretended to be The Kennedy Center.
Told her she was getting a lifetime achievement award.
And then, I said "psych"!
But she got me back.
Really?
What'd she do?
I'll tell ya.
She waited ten minutes.
And then, she crank called me pretending to be -- Get this -- The Kennedy Center.
Told me I was getting a lifetime achievement award.
Then, when I got excited, she said, "gotcha"!
Can you imagine?
"Gotcha"!
Never saw it coming!
Sitcom legends are so smart.
Come on, let's prank her back.
I'll knock her out, and you put her hand in warm water.
Come on.
No, Karen, I can't.
As a student nurse, I have now seen the darker side of practical jokes.
Just last week we had two cases of extreme chafing from victims of surprise wedgies.
- Hey, Walker.
- Hiya, Murphy.
- What's shaking?
- Not a thing.
I'm in fantastic shape.
Yeah, I saw you in Sweet Home Miss Congeniality.
Those were two different movies.
Were they?
Not from my airplane seat You know, Karen, I hate to hit you up for a donation right now, but I'm working with an organization that restores the decaying facades of New York's oldest monuments.
Wow.
That sounds important.
Well, here you go, honey.
Thanks.
Now buy your decaying facade a turtleneck and a big hat.
Ha!
I walked right to her trap!
My advice, Karen.
Let it go before someone gets hurt.
Just the other day, we heard this story.
Kid comes in.
Kid's uncle's got his nose.
Put it in his pocket.
Misplaced it.
Never saw the nose again.
Heh, good luck breathin'.
Huh?
All right, forget it, Dr. Queer Medicine Woman.
I'll prank her on my own.
There he is!
There's the man.
What's the good word?
Ew.
Who are you?
What're you doing?
You're oddly confident and overly familiar.
You met someone!
Who was it?
Was it someone in just a pair of sleeves and a collar?
Did he complete you?
I gave you my number.
And you never called me.
Yeah, you were too into me.
Back then, I was only into guys who were into guys.
- And what about now?
- Now?
Now, I'm, uh Don't tell me.
You're dating someone?
No, no.
No, I'm not exactly dating anybody.
No Great, great.
Um, can I stay for dinner?
Yeah, I'd like that.
Hey, Can-Can.
Listen.
Honey, I've been thinking about us.
Look, Karen, that was a one time thing.
I'd never had sake before.
No, honey, I'm just saying all these silly pranks, I think they're getting in the way of our friendship.
What do you say we call a truce?
Truce, huh?
Okay.
I just don't know if I can get a refund on all those bees.
Oh, good.
'Cause I really hate to fight.
Especially on your birthday.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy 75th birthday dear Karen Walker!
Happy 75th birthday to you!
Gotcha!
Excuse me, it's kind of a special night for us.
We're celebrating our anniversary and how do I put this delicately?
How much free crap can we get?
I'll see what I can do.
Okay, wait, we're married now?
Well, the way I figure it, if you'd ever called me that's where we would have ended up.
Really?
And how many years have we been married?
- I don't know, uh, four years, five?
- Nice, don't even remember.
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to think of a time in my life when I wasn't married to you.
'Scuse me.
Question.
What am I watching?
What show is this?
What?
We're just doing it to get free appetizers.
You've done a lot worse for a lot less.
True.
Carry on.
- Uh, Stephanie.
- Oh, hi, sexy.
Hi, oblivious.
- Oh, my God!
I was supposed to join you.
- Yeah, like half an hour ago!
I'm sorry, I guess I lost track of time.
Are-- Are you mad at me?
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, I am a little mad.
I mean, do you think it's okay to say you're gonna meet someone and then not show up?
Is that what you do?
Is it your thing?
Steph?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was such a big deal.
Well, then, I guess it wasn't.
You know, you said you like my vest.
You said I look like a movie star.
If that's not a meaningful connection, I don't know what is.
Have a nice life, Stephanie.
Excuse me, I'm student nurse McFarland.
If any men here need breast exams, I'm at table five.
Okay?
Men.
Jackie, you gotta help me.
Bergen just hit me with a double-double, and we gotta prank her back.
Come on.
No, Karen, I'm sorry.
I am a student nurse now.
I am not going to be your circus monkey anymore.
Listen, monkey!
You'll be my monkey until I tell you you're not my monkey anymore!
So go grab your banana peel and throw it on the floor!
No!
Now, you listen to me, McFarland.
You better watch your back.
I can't.
- Listen, guys, I think I'm gonna take off.
- Oh, Will, you look upset.
Don't forget to leave your credit card.
Will, don't leave.
Let me make it up to you.
Let me buy you a drink.
You think a drink is gonna make up for how you hurt my feelings?
- You look cute when you pout.
- I guess I could.
Oh, I'm so embararrassed I just told you that.
Oh, don't be.
I think it's cute that you used to steal change from your nana's purse.
- It's a little wierd it was yesterday.
- Shut up!
- Will, you didn't leave.
- No, I decided to stay.
Good.
This is Alex.
I'm Grace.
- This is Stephanie.
- Hi, everybody.
Have you guys eaten yet?
- No, we've been so busy talking we haven't even ordered yet.
- Ok, then.
What's good, what's good?
Oh, you know, if you get a pasta, I'll get a chicken.
Then we can share.
That sounds good.
If I get a fish and you get a pasta, I'll have half of your pasta.
Ooh, you know who I heard has the best pasta in the city?
Babbo.
I've never been there, but I hear it's delish.
And romantic.
We should go.
Should we go together?
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah, this weekend.
- It's a date.
- Okay.
Grace.
What're you doing?
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Is this the person you met?
- Leave her out of this.
- I'd like to, but she's fingering your hair.
And he's holding your hand.
Are you guys together?
- No, of course not, he's gay.
- And she's married.
- You're married?
- You're gay?
Uh, hello, how many straight guys do you know who wear vests?
And how many single girls do you know who wear a-- Who don't wear a wedding ring?
- It's being resized.
- Yeah, in your pocket, whore.
I can't believe you.
We're on a date!
You thought this was a date?
You offered to buy me a drink, then you made me feel guilty and horrible about myself.
That's a date!
Married?
I can't believe this.
All I wanted was to meet a nice girl Get to know her slowly And let it blossom into a meaningful relationship.
And I just wanted get laid.
Your thing sounds better.
Let's go.
Men.
Honey, help!
You were right.
Practical jokes are dangerous.
I put a balloon in her soup and now she's choking.
I think Candice Bergen is going to die!
I told you this was going to happen!
Honey, come on.
Oh, my God!
There she is!
Jackie, do something!
She's the last good thing to happen to the tiffany network.
Uh, step 1: "Identify the victim".
Oh, my God, it's Candice Bergen, I'm a big fan!
- Step 2-- - Hurry, hurry!
Loved you in Carnal Knowledge.
Brilliant in Starting Over.
Anything?
Gotcha!
Oh, that's the best prank we've played since we set up Martha Stewart.
How dare you?
!
I thought her liver exploded!
I was about to give her a tracheotomy.
Honey.
Okay, that's kinda funny.
Confetti, Candice Bergen.
Wow.
Can you believe those two?
They totally took advantage of us.
He never once said he was single.
And she never said a word about not having a penis.
This is all your fault, you know.
You're the one that said I should get out and live a little.
Yeah, I meant change your underwear and brush your teeth, not pick up a stranger.
Why did I do that?
You're just going through a hard time.
I am.
I miss Leo so much.
It was really nice to get some male attention, you know.
Ew, am I that girl?
We're all that girl.
That was fun.
Thanks for keeping me real, Kare.
Nursing can be so stressful sometimes.
It's important to remember what really matters.
A cheap laugh at someone else's expense.
You're welcome, Jackie.
But you got ol' C.B. here to thank for that.
If she had anything better to do on a Saturday night, none of this could've happened.
You know, Jack.
There's two things I've learned in my long career in show business.
The first is, don't take yourself too seriously.
And the second is, always wear a double layer of underpants when you're doing a bed scene with Jack Nicholson.
But really, Candi, maybe we should slow down on the pranks.
Hey, I'm willing if you are.
Shake on it?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Psych!
Super Glue on the silverware.
Classic Walker.
Ha ha ha ha!
Congratulations, Walker.
You got me.
Again.
See ya around, slugger.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Oh, I tell ya, Grace.
This is one kick-ass office Christmas party.
I, for one, am having an absolute ball.
You must feel so naughty drinking in the middle of the day.
Oh!
Honey, is there liquor in this?
Well once a year.
All right!
I believe it's time for the annual Christmas bonus.
And here it is.
Wow!
$1,000!
Thank you!
You know, a secretary on the second floor told me that the boss usually gives the bonuses.
Karen, are you gonna believe those women?
They're the same people who told you you shouldn't be paying for my health coverage.
Merry Christmas!
I'm wearing my holiday stocking.
I guess you can't see it.
Looks like things are in full swing.
God, everybody showed up this year.
That's nice.
Have you heard from Will?
I thought he was gonna stop by.
Oh, right.
He's not here.
Oh!
I'm sorry, honey.
He did call.
What did he say?
Well, let me pull it up on the computer.
Okay, here he is.
"3:11 P.M.: Volunteering tonight at the shelter.
Don't wait for me.
I'll see ya tomorrow".
I'll just flag that as 'read' and archive it.
That's our Will.
He's kind of a modern-day saint.
Much like mine and Karen's Lord Jesus, he's a celibate man who lives to help others.
Excuse me.
Is this where you line up for Barry Manilow tickets?
You're the first one.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting for the box office to open.
Tickets go on sale at 6:00 A.M. You do know this is the line for Barry Manilow?
For his one night only A Very Barry Christmas?
So, if that's not why you're here for-- It is!
Keep your voice down.
The whole street doesn't have to know.
Damn it!
I can't believe you got here before me.
I've been following Barry around the country since 1988, and I've never been in line behind anyone.
Ever.
Well, you are now.
I got here first.
Isn't that right, Barry?
That's right, Boss.
Wait a minute.
You're the guy that made his own Barry bobble-head?
I know you.
Do you chat?
- Do I what?
- The Barry Manilow chat room.
Are you into it?
Are you a fanilow?
A "fanilow"?
No.
Maybe I've gone to the chat room a couple of times.
Oh, yeah, a "couple of times".
Bull crap, fancy nancy.
I know who you are.
You're "No One Fanilow".
Number One Fanilow.
Oh, really?
'Cause it looks like "no one fanilow" when you write it.
Copacafana 82.
You're Copacafana 82?
Oh, my god!
You're like the leader of the fanilows.
Your web site is amazing!
I love your pencil sketches of Rico and Lola when they were kids.
That's so cool!
- Yeah, I know.
So can I get in front of you?
- It's not that cool.
Hey.
What's this line for?
Is it something free?
Food?
Eh, what the hell.
If there's a line, it must be something good.
Will?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were feeding the homeless.
- Turns out they were just snackish.
So, so, I decided to-- - Take the one thing that was good in my life and piss on it.
What's going on?
And where'd you get the little chairs?
All right.
I'm in line for Barry Manilow tickets, and I didn't tell you 'cause I knew you'd make fun of me.
And why would you think that Mrs. Manilow?
Quit it.
What are you even doing here?
I thought you were Hanukkah-shopping with your mom.
I'm off the hook.
She called and said she wasn't coming into town.
It's a Hanukkah miracle.
It's like that time in Hebrew school when I bit into that dreidel on a hunch and it turned out to be chocolate.
Hey, look, could you do me a favor?
I've had to pee for like an hour, but I didn't want to lose my place.
Can you stay here while I go to the sub shop across the street?
What if someone sees me?
Well, then they'll be excited to meet the cat in the hat.
Five minutes!
Oh, no holdsies.
What?
!
You're not the line monitor.
Oh, this badge says different.
And if you start messing with fanilow line protocol, you're gonna have a lot of white, middle-aged people angry with you.
Can she hold my place if I let you be first?
I think that'd be okay.
I'll be right back.
So, uh, are you a fanilow, too?
Oh, uh No, dear.
I'm a doctor's wife.
Is that--?
That is my mother!
She said she wasn't coming.
Why would she lie to me?
I don't know.
That's your mom?
So you got this from your dad?
Who's that cute guy that just sat down with her?
Jack?
!
- Excuse me.
Can I just scoot in front of you?
I just want to get the bathroom key.
- No, I've been waiting.
People are amazing, aren't they?
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
- If I was at the front of the line, I'd let you in.
- Mmm.
Rudy.
I really just want to use the bathroom.
- Hello?
- My mother is across the street having dinner with Jack.
What do you think's going on?
Well, what do you care?
You didn't want to see her, you're not seeing her.
I know.
I'm just curious.
I'm a naturally curious person who's interested in how things work in the world.
I thought you were a naturally lazy person who didn't care how things happened as long as she didn't have to do them.
Oh, yeah.
That's who I am.
Look, I'm gonna go and see what's up.
No!
Do not leave that line!
If you do, I'll end up with second row center instead of first row center, and this is the only thing getting me through the holidays!
Don't move!
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Look, I know I'm fat, but I got a decent personality, and I make my own clothes.
I'm--I'm really not interested.
I'd love to put you in a daisy duke denim romper.
What size are you?
No.
Why would they even be together?
I mean, not that I care.
I mean, beddah him than me.
That's for sure.
Beddah him than me.
It's just weird, you know, 'cause my mother lives for her weekends with me.
So, so it's a little weird.
You know what?
Uh, even though I live alone, nobody likes me at work, and I follow a 57-year-old pop singer around the country, this is boring, so Could you just talk to the person on the other side of you?
Wazzup?
Honey, I couldn't understand your message.
"Some mary needs a line of blow"?
I'm in line for Barry Manilow.
Look, I've gotta run across the street, okay?
Jack is having dinner with my mother and-- Hey, you don't know anything about that, do you?
I know about a misguided gay man and a deluded older woman who have needs just like you and me.
Never mind.
Well, you just stay here.
Will was waiting in line for tickets, and if I lose his place, he's gonna kill me, or, even worse, make me go to the damn show.
You look odd.
I'm devastated that you've decided to turn your back on your acting, dear.
Well, you know, Bobbi, sometimes when you turn your back, you create an opportunity for your front.
Yes, but acting is your life, dear.
Without it, you're just another sexually confused boy.
Well, I don't know, you know.
I feel like I've played all the great roles, you know?
Man on bus, man at counter, man number 3.
Woman.
As a nurse, I only have to play one role: doctor.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm supposed to tell you that a very buff gentleman needs to see you at the bar right away.
Bobbi, this sounds like a medical emergency.
I just wish I had more time to put on a smock.
- Jack!
- Aah!
Grace!
You scared me!
I'm gonna look all flustered for my buff gentleman.
Jack, I am the buff gentleman.
Wow.
Conceited much?
Why are you having dinner with my mother?
Please tell me it's because you're still working on a drag version of her.
Because she invited me.
And I almost have the voice down.
What's the big whoop?
How would you like it if I had dinner with your mother?
Oh, that's not gonna happen.
My mother doesn't care for you.
Mom.
- Grace, what are you doing here?
- Never mind that.
What are you doing having dinner with Jack on our traditional Hanukkah-shopping weekend?
Oh, my God!
And you're even having a traditional Hanukkah short ribs dinner?
Grace, I know you don't enjoy our time together.
So I called someone who I know would enjoy it.
Oh, well, great.
Great, well, have fun.
You don't need me, I don't need you.
If you would rather spend time with Jack, then have fun.
Live it up.
"Beddah him than me" is what I'm saying.
Beddah him than me.
Such drama.
She's never forgiven me for being the prettier sister.
Your bathroom could use some freshening up maybe an orchid in a small vase, or someone could help the man passed out in a puddle of Liquid Dial.
That's Tommy.
He's on his break.
Is that Barry Manilow order ready yet?
So you mentioned a romper.
How would that work exactly?
Buttons down the front?
Yeah, I guess.
Subs are good here, huh?
Especially to go.
They travel well.
And--and where will you be traveling with your subs tonight, I wonder?
I'm Barry Manilow's road manager.
He's got a Christmas concert across the street.
Oh!
?
Huh!
Barry Manilow.
There's a blast from the past.
Singer, right?
Why are you talking to me?
You seem interesting.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I can't flirt on a full bladder.
I'm empty now.
Hi.
You're a fanilow, aren't you?
A--a--a what?
A what?
A fanilow?
Wh--wh--what is that?
This is an interesting turn.
To make it worse for you, you're actually kissing up to the right guy.
I have direct access to the Manilow.
I can even get you into the rehearsal to meet Barry.
But you're not interested.
Not so fat now, am I, brown eyes?
So you and Barry are lovers?
God, no.
I wish!
I've never even met him.
But he has brought me to climax more times than any other man.
And yet you stand in line on bitterly cold nights just to hear his music?
I don't get it.
- Well, have you ever heard his music?
- No.
He makes you feel like he knows you, like everything you've ever felt and everything you ever wish is okay with him.
He makes you feel less alone in the world.
Eek.
Sad.
No, it's impossible to be sad when you hear him.
Okay, honey.
Let's just agree to disagree on this one because I really-- Oh!
Oh, my!
Oh, why-- Why, that's just Look, Rudy-- God, you've got lashes for days.
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
Did we?
'Cause five minutes ago, you were looking at me like some monster you ran into in the woods.
Are you kidding?
Maybe a--maybe a hot monster.
In--in--in in the forest of hunk.
Heh.
Grrrrr-rowl!
Save it.
You fanilows make me sick.
But you did notice I got my lashes tinted, and none of the roadies did.
So grab the Sun Chips, and I'll take you over to sound check and introduce you to Barry.
You will?
You are such a nice man!
If you go ou with me after the concert.
What?
!
Do you realize what you're suggesting?
That is sexual blackmail!
Yeah, I know.
Okay, so long as we're clear.
You know, I'm glad she's with Jack.
It's better this way.
Yeah.
You don't need her or her supermarket makeup.
You said it.
And you know what I say?
Beddah him than me.
That's right.
Beddah him than me.
Don't talk to her anymore unless you want to hear that "better him than me" thing like a thousand more times.
He could be her new daughter, for all I care.
This is great for me!
Great!
Beddah him than me.
That's right.
Beddah him than me.
I remember all my life, raining down as cold as ice.
Shadows of a man, a face through a window, cryin' in the night, the night goes into morning, just another day.
Happy people pass my way.
Looking in their eyes, I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me.
Oh, mommy !
Oh, you came and you gave without taking, but I sent you away.
Oh, mommy!
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking!
And I need you today!
Oh, mommy!
Oh, Bobbi, I love spending time with you.
I tell ya, if I were 30 years older and you were 30 years younger And a man.
Wow!
Imagine the feweworks!
Oh, fireworks.
I tell ya, these days, I'm lucky if I can get Mr. Adler's fuse lit.
Oh, Bobbi, I love it when you work blue!
Mommy.
I need to talk to you.
- You're back.
What is it, dear?
- Grace, what are you doing--?
- Get out.
- But you can't-- - Get out!
It's not fair.
You-- You're my mother, not Jack's.
You gave me life, even though it almost killed you doing it, as you remind me every year on my birthday.
So, not better him than me.
Better me than him.
Oh.
So you wanna be with me?
Yes.
I mean, the holidays are all about misery and obligation and the Maccabees riding an elephant, or whatever the hell Hanukkah is about.
And if I didn't have that every year, I'd--I'd miss it.
Oh, dear, I'd miss it, too, darling.
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, that's my mother.
No way I'm getting that!
Karen, Grace is after me.
If you see her, fire a warning shot into her hair.
Wh--what are we in line for?
God, from the looks of this crowd, I hope it's birth control.
Oh, honey, it's the most wonderful thing.
His name is Barry Manilow.
He's cuter than Deepak, and you don't have to buy a lot of crap to believe in him.
This is Cheryl.
She's a fanilow.
The man makes me happy.
This is Jackie.
He's a fagalow.
The mens make me happy, too.
I'm gonna get you house seats for the show tomorrow night, but then remember what you said.
You and me, a date.
I know what I said.
We're going on a date.
So, where do you wanna go?
Well, the band leaves on the bus right after the show tomorrow night.
So you're gonna have to come with me to Philadelphia.
We'll have our date there.
That's the deal.
Philadelphia?
!
City of brotherly love.
- Follow me.
I'll take you straight to Barry.
- Oh!
Out of my way, you stinkin' fanilows.
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't cut!
Actually, I can.
I'm going to meet Barry Manilow.
And then he's going on a date with me to Philadelphia.
But first, I'm gonna meet Barry Manilow.
And then Philadelphia.
We're going hoppin' today, where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way.
We're gonna drop in on all the music they play on the bandstand.
Bandstand.
You're not half bad!
Barry, I thought you were gonna clear out in a few minutes.
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't have to go.
You can stay, stay!
Please stay.
Barry's gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta go to the copacabaÑo.
Ha ha ha ha!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
There she is, the woman who set my heart on fire.
Which is a nice change, since the women I'm usually with cause a burning feeling in an altogether different area.
Get lost, David Cop-a-feel.
Just because we once made out like drunk straight girls at a frat party, doesn't mean you're wanted here.
Hi.
Welcome to my office.
And we usually reserve this kind of talk for casual sex Friday.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.
Lyle Finster.
Finster?
Oh my God.
You're Lorraine's father.
You tricked Karen into kissing you.
That's right.
And it ain't never gonna happen again.
- No, sir.
Not on my watch.
- I understand.
But I only came here to return the kiss that you left on my lips.
What?
Give it back!
If you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go in the back and gouge out my eyes and puncture my eardrums.
Oh, no, honey, stay.
I was just taking back my-- Hey!
Karen, I'm lost without you.
I've tried to fill the void with secretaries and whores, but at the end of the hour, it's you I wish I was paying.
Really, I'm uncomfortable.
It's never gonna happen between us, Lyle.
So beat it.
Very well.
But I'll never forget you.
Every mouth that I kiss will be your mouth.
Every bottom that I slap will be your bottom.
- Every nipple that I tweak-- - Please, one of us has to go!
- Get out.
- Very well.
But know this: Every vagina-- - Get out!
!
- Oh, I have to tell you something.
- Me too.
In your dreams.
My mom called.
My screw-up older sister Janet is in town.
And you know that she's gonna show up here asking for money or a place to crash while they fumigate her van.
So, whatever you do, do not open the door.
Hey, Will.
You said help yourself to anything in the bathroom, so I put your blow-dryer in my purse.
Wanna hear my news now?
- Hey, Smudge.
- Hello, Janet.
You look good.
When did you stop shaving your head?
I just did that 'cause my boyfriend Tony told me to.
He--he thought I was too full of myself.
Well, it looks nice.
Mom will be happy.
She may finally forgive you for using Aunt May's urn for your stash.
Hey, I didn't know what it was.
I just thought it was really dusty.
On the inside?
Um, Will?
I'm studying for a test.
What does "A.D.D." stand for again?
Oh, my God!
Janet Adler!
Hi, cuteness!
Look at you with hair!
- You like it?
Doesn't make me look like I'm too full of myself?
- Little bit.
So, where you staying?
Um, der, right here.
Will invited me.
It won't be for long.
Just until I can get my jewelry line going.
Oh So Now you have a jewelry line.
What'd you do, roll your old roach clips in glitter?
You should see her work, Grace.
She does these barrettes.
Three tiny roses nestled in beadwork.
It's adorable.
I'm excited about barrettes, and that's okay.
Of course you are.
Finally, a way to dress up all that hair on your pillow.
So-- Listen, I figure if I set up a folding table at St. Mark's Place, I could start getting celebrities interested in buying them, and then I'm pretty much set.
Sounds smart.
Nothing attracts celebrities like a folding table.
Hey, it's gonna have a poncho on it.
That could work.
Salma Hayek bought one of my friend's handcrafted purses.
Do you know what that friend is doing today?
Stalking Salma Hayek.
True story.
Oh, Grace.
I had to apply for a credit card in your name.
I've got "warrants".
- No, absolutely not.
- Well, I have, um, Will's Sears card.
You want that?
Yeah, I'll take it.
Thanks.
Stop!
No.
No credit cards.
No money.
No staying here.
You know what, I just-- I cannot have this in my life right now.
You are a wreck.
And I am sick of taking care of you.
- I mean, how about you get a normal job?
How about you find a place of your own?
How about you get a life?
!
- I am trying!
But it is hard!
I am going to school, I am changing careers.
So what if I need a little help every now and then?
Why do you have to judge?
You wonder why I don't like you.
Now you know.
- I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Janet.
- Oh, well, I wasn't really talking to you either.
Grace didn't mean that.
She just gets crazy when she's hungry.
W-w-we had slow service at the Carnegie Deli once, she started going to other people's tables and asking if she could suck on their napkins.
True story.
Will, it's okay.
She meant what she said.
Thanks for the blow-dryer And the poncho.
I'm gonna go.
- Wow.
You think maybe you were a little hard on her?
- No.
All I've ever done my whole life is clean up her mess.
I just want a normal sister who I can count on.
The only thing I can count on Janet for is a great connection to sleeping pills and all the lyrics to "Sugar Magnolia".
I am with Grace.
That girl's a leech.
You gotta cut those leeches out of your life before they leech right off ya.
Oh, hey, Will, can you help me move this table over to my apartment?
I'm having company.
Grace, grab the chicken.
Yeah, listen, Ro-Ro, I'm gonna be a little late tonight.
So you're gonna have to turn the hose on yourself and search your own room.
Oh, that voice.
It's like two cats screwing.
Lorraine Finster!
You murdering bitch!
You've got a lot of balls showing up here.
No, I don't.
My parents had them removed when they decided to raise me as a girl.
I have searched the far corners of the globe for you.
Where the hell have you been hiding?
I've been in the chorus of Taboo, the Boy George musical.
- That is so weird.
You know, I was gonna see that last week when I was at the two-fer booth, but I saw Little Shop instead.
- How was it?
I felt the plant phoned it in.
What the hell are you doing here?
!
I just came to tell you one thing.
You stay the bloody hell away from my father!
- I'm not interested in your father!
- Oh, really?
My moles tell me differently.
Honey, when they get big enough to talk, it's time to see a new dermy.
Save it.
You are not to see that man again.
'Cause if you do, I'll cut your insides out and serve 'em up cafeteria-style with creamed corn and dirty silverware!
All right, all right.
Say it, don't spray it, Saliva Doolittle.
You've made yourself clear.
You don't want me to see him, so I'll leave him alone.
I want you, Finny.
I wanna run my hands through your hair from ears to ass.
What--what made you change your mind?
Nothing specific.
Certainly not a desire to stick it to anyone, if that's what you're implying.
Let's make love.
It's gonna be beautiful.
- I'm gonna hoist you up on that light fixture-- - Oh, can you grab hold of it?
- I sure can, yeah.
What's up, Will?
Hey, smudge.
I know, I know.
I'm not even dressed for a court appearance.
Look at you.
I've been trying to bring back the bob for years.
Wow.
What did you do?
Well, after I left here the other night, I thought a lot about what you said.
Actually, not right after.
Uh, first I stopped off at the Korean deli to get some bourbon and crackers.
Luckily, they took Will's Sears card.
Anyway, when I woke up the next morning in the cashier's apartment, I thought-- Maybe Grace is right.
Maybe my life is out of control.
So, I got myself a job.
And I found a place to live.
You know, Janet, I cannot tell you how many times anonymous sex has led to a career change for me.
Yeah.
So, where you working?
Ann Taylor.
Fitting room supervisor.
I think I got hired 'cause I was the only one that could see over the doors.
"How you doin' in there"?
So, you like?
Employee discount.
No one does fashion on a budget like Ann.
Except Lane Bryant, but you know, that's--that's for biggies.
- Janet, good for you.
- Also, Jones New York.
Actually very reasonable.
Great separates.
But you can build a suit in any of those places.
Okay, I want you to stop while you're still a man.
Oh, oh!
And wait 'til you see my new apartment.
Oh, it's so great waking up knowing where I am.
Without having to shout out the window, "Hey, what city is this"?
Anyway, Smudgy, this is all because of you.
You lit a fire under my butt.
And--I mean, in a good way, not like when we were kids.
And to thank you, I'd like to have you all over for dinner.
Janet, I am so proud of you.
And even more so, I'm proud of me.
I mean, this is-- this is a tribute to you.
But even more so, it's a tribute to me.
Oh, Karen, that was the best sex I've had in my life.
There we are.
- What the--!
?
- Oh, sorry, love.
Old habits die hard.
No, honey, it's not that.
This is half my usual rate.
Bloody hell!
What is going on?
- What the hell are you doing here?
!
- You told me to be here at exactly 7:00.
I did no such thing!
Why would I do that if I knew I was gonna be sexing up your father at exactly 7:00?
- Lorraine, is it really you?
- Hello, Daddy.
Good God!
Last time I saw you, I was bouncing you on my knee.
Yes, I remember.
It was my 30th birthday.
Aww, nice reunion.
Now run along so your daddy and I can make love.
Yes, well, before you do that, I think you should know she's only sleeping with you to get back at me.
How dare you!
Where would you get such an outrageous idea?
!
From you, ya cow!
You invited me here.
You sent a car, and you put a bloody great sign in the lobby saying, "Nasty surprise for Lorraine Finster in room 315".
- I did not!
You're delusional.
Throw her out of here!
- She's a liar!
Throw her out of here!
S-s-such a difficult decision.
I mean, second only to deciding whether to raise you as a boy or a girl.
Keep in touch, okay?
But, daddy!
I-I'm sorry, Lorraine.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you, and I am in love with Karen.
What?
You are?
Yes, and it's--it's never happened to me before.
But what about my mummy?
Well, I-I wasn't so much in love with mummy as I was in an alley and out of condoms.
Fine.
You've made your choice.
But I can guarantee you'll be sorry.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the Taboo wrap party.
They have them every night just in case.
Let me give you the tour.
This is the living room, slash dining room, slash kitchen, slash bedroom.
So, how'd you like the tour?
Um, if this is the bathroom too, could everybody turn around?
It's--it's right through that door.
You might have to jiggle the, uh, thingy.
Oh, I always jiggle the thingy.
I think she meant on the toilet.
The handle on the toilet.
Oh, your place is cute.
It's quaint, charming, darling.
I'm running out of ways to say "small".
Hey, it may be small, but her hair is fantastic.
God, that's a good bob!
You know, I don't mean to toot my own horn, but how many 44-year-olds do you know who have their own apartment and a job?
Certainly not your spiritual sisters from the ashram.
Who did that Italian mural in there?
It's so beautiful.
As I was peeing, I did a 360 so I could see the whole thing.
Oh, I'm--I'm glad you like it.
I just did it to cover up what the previous tenant had.
A crude carving that said, "Make it stop".
It is beautiful.
I like the way you've made the light switch into a-a horny Italian guy.
Could you do a mural for me?
I really need to freshen up my apartment.
Whoever did it, it's just a little dated.
I did your apartment.
Oh.
How awkward for you.
- Oh, excuse me, I gotta stick my head in the oven.
- Ooh, last time you did that, they had to stick you in a state facility for three weeks.
- Would you quit taking shots at your sister?
She's doing great.
- What are you talking about?
I'm very happy for her.
- Yeah, well, then act like it.
You wanted her normal, she's normal.
Well, she's peeling a potato with a Lady Schick, but still.
- Karen?
- I ran all the way here.
I broke my heel tripping over a blind man in an attempt to avoid his dog.
Well, w-what happened?
I mean, I tell you I love you, and then you don't return my calls.
Well, I got kind of freaked out.
But no one's ever picked me over their daughter before.
Not Jon Voight, not Steven Tyler.
Not Goldie Hawn.
The thing is I love you too, Finny.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Come to me.
I want to plow you like a Calgary driveway at Christmas.
- No, darling, there's more.
- No, that will wait.
Come to me.
I want to land on you like it's a clear day at Heathrow.
Save your pretty talk for someone who deserves it.
Lorraine was right.
I was just shtupping you to shtick it to her.
I don't undershtand.
I lied to you, Finny.
I fell in love with you while I was doing it.
But stillI lied.
I'm sorry.
Do you think you could ever forgive me?
- No.
- No?
I chose you over my daughter, and now you've made a fool of me.
And to think I was picturing us together in a cottage in the Cotswolds with a stone fireplace and a rose garden, picking up the occasional townsperson for a three-way.
What a beautiful dream.
No, no.
I-I-I don't want to see you anymore.
- But Finny, I-- - Please leave.
Good-bye.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm!
Janet, tiramisu?
Tear-a down my cheek, it's so good.
I was gonna say that.
Now I have to say something else cute.
Oh, I got it.
Hewwo.
Grace, you must be happy.
Tiramisu's your favorite.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.
- Well, the whole meal was great.
I just want to stop and take a moment and just-- Our hostess, huh?
You know, people don't applaud during meals anymore.
I miss it.
- Guys, come on, you're being too nice.
- No, Janet, really, you're being modest.
- I mean, you're a woman that got her life together in a week and three days.
Aren't you proud of her, Grace?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.
- I mean, with the Ann Taylor and the fancy desserts and the artwork in the bathroom-- - You really do have it all, lady.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop clapping for her.
The woman made three chicken cutlets and drew a cartoon over the crapper, big whoop.
Thank you!
Somebody finally said it.
I'm sorry, but I can't handle you normal.
This is not right, this is not the way it's supposed to be.
You are the screw-up older sister.
Joyce is the heavy younger sister.
And I am the perfect one in the middle.
I am the glue that holds you two losers together.
- Believe me, Grace, I'm still a loser.
- No, you're not!
You've got your life together now.
No, I don't!
It's all an illusion.
I'm just a puppet.
And he's the one with his hand up my ass!
- He made me do it.
- Shut up!
- What?
- Listen, you told me to get my life together.
And Will said he could help me do that.
All I had to do was listen to everything he said and not ask any stupid questions.
He--he made the meal.
He got me the job.
He gave me this ridiculous haircut.
Who has a bob these days?
People who want to look good!
Uh, Will?
I just wanted you to have a normal older sister.
That's what you said you wanted, and I wanted to do it for you.
Y-y-you've had a tough year.
Your husband's away.
Your-your hair's kinda "eh".
You put on a few pounds, I pretend not to notice.
I-- I just wanted to give that to you.
So, wait a minute.
You-- You both did this for me?
- We did.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Stop that hugging!
Everything hasn't been neatly resolved.
I have been here all night, and not one person has noticed my right hand ring!
I have used this hand to drink, I have used this hand to eat.
I even used this hand to jiggle my thingy, and nothing.
- Oh, Jack It's beautiful.
- Sparkly.
So pretty.
So, Grace, if it makes you feel any better, I got fired today for being drunk on the job.
And then I went out and got drunk 'cause I got fired.
- You mean it?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, this is so wonderful.
I hope Joyce is stress-eating right now.
Rosie, I'm glad you're home.
You got a minute?
I'm a little down.
See, the guy I'm in love with-- Well, it turns out he don't love me no mo'.
But you know what?
I'm not gonna give up.
No, I'm not.
Because when you meet someone that you feel that deep connection with, you must do everything in your power to-- And the bitch hung up on me.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
This dinner is delicious.
And I love that it's all finger food.
Grace, just 'cause you eat half a chicken like it's an apple doesn't make it finger food.
I'm cute.
Ooh.
You know how I love to talk about food I'm going to eat while I'm already eating food?
We do.
Okay, check it out.
A great new noodle shop opened across from my office.
Happy Noodles.
You know, with all the ugliness in the world, a good noodle shop just seems to be God's way of saying everything's gonna be okay.
I believe that's from the book of "noodlerami".
This menu rocks!
Every dish is more incredible than the last.
Should I take the uppers down a notch, or do I actually care about noodles?
You know, Will, since we're pairing off, what are we gonna do tomorrow night?
Well, I was gonna go to this art opening.
Ooh, that sounds great.
I'd love to join you.
It's not a person named "Art," you understand?
Yes, I know.
But there's always a lot of rich, old gay guys at those things looking for younger gay guys to take care of.
You know, the way Dick Cheney takes care of George Bush.
Fascinating.
It says his influences are Dali, Cezanne, and Monet.
Yikes!
Look at the price.
Hello, "Dali".
That's a lot of "Monet".
Yeah, why don't you type that up and send it in to Smarty's Digest?
-Could you at least pretend to be interested in the arts?
-I am distracted!
This place is chock-a-block with rich, old gay guys ripe for the pickin'.
Ooh, an 80-year-old in an ascot.
Wish me luck.
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna Nicole, you're so outrageous I saw that.
But don't worry.
I put a mushroom cap in that hat earlier.
I'm sorry, it's just-- Women in big hats tap a hidden rage in me.
You know what makes me mad?
Squirrels in Central Park that make eye contact.
Very unsettling.
You know, you-- You have almost perfect features.
Actually, only yesterday, I gave your lips to a young lady for her sweet sixteen.
And your cheekbones to a Doobie Brother.
Ah, you're either a plastic surgeon, or I'm Mr. Potatohead.
-Will, Will Truman.
-I'm Alan Mills.
-What is it you do, Will?
-I'm a lawyer.
Please.
You must have passed the bar at 12.
Stop it, I-- I don't look that young.
Although when the judge calls a recess, I instinctively grab my juice box and run for the monkey bars.
Of course, the war brought us out of the depression.
Mm, yeah.
Depression's rough.
Yeah.
You know what pulls me out of it?
New shoes.
New anything, really.
I love when people give me things.
If you like it so much, why don't you buy it?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a little out of my range.
If I'm gonna spend a ridiculous amount of money, I want it to be for something practical, you know, like a-- like a sweater.
Please, if people were practical, my only patients would be the occasional burn victim.
We're out of champagne.
I still have shrapnel in my spine.
Oh, Bertram, you're killing me.
You're funny, you're smart.
I just want to pick you up, put you on my hand, and make a wish.
Yeah, yeah!
Can I have your watch?
Congratulations, Mr. Truman.
You can pick this up after the show.
Well, no-- no, you made a mistake.
I--I didn't buy that.
That's right, I bought it for you.
Oh, oh, no.
No, Alan, I can't-- I can't take that.
Please, take it, darling, I'm rich.
And it gives me pleasure to see people who appreciate art.
Well, I-- I don't know what to say.
Thank you.
You know, there's another opening tomorrow night at the Locus Gallery.
Why don't we meet out front, say 7:30?
-That sounds nice, but I--I think-- -Of course.
We have to eat first.
Make it 6:00 at the Mercer Kitchen.
Well, sure.
Ah, but-- But dinner's on me.
We'll see.
I'm in!
Bertram asked for my number.
And to remind him where he was.
That guy just bought me this painting.
What?
!
I want a painting.
I want something.
Jack, you said you didn't have a watch.
Yes.
It's 9:30.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Honey, these noodles are terrif'.
And that's a big compliment coming from me.
I'm Asian.
They're amazing, aren't they?
I just want to strip naked and writhe around in a giant take-out container full of them.
And I guess I'm done.
Well, here is your Happy take-out order.
Yay, I'm so excited.
I can't wait 'til I'm hungry again.
You know, Happy noodles really do make me ha-- Ow!
-Oh, no, my beautiful noodles.
-Grace, please!
The girl will do anything to get a peek at my pie.
Don't worry miss, uh, we will take care of it.
I am so, so sorry.
I didn't know that they were gonna be that hot.
I guess I'm gonna need another order.
Absolutely.
That's $7.95.
I shouldn't have to pay for that.
It's replacement noodles.
You order noodles, you have to pay.
Are you kiddin' me?
This was totally your fault.
Everyone knows, if someone brings you something hot, they're supposed to say, "hot plate, hot plate".
And the top wasn't put on properly.
You're supposed to go-- "Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch" -- All the way around.
But you, you were like, "Ch-ch-ch -- I'm tired".
$7.95.
You know what?
You just made the biggest mistake of your life, my friend.
Big mistake.
I am not someone that you want to trifle with.
You don't want to trifle with her.
You are gonna rue the day that you ever messed with Grace Adler.
Grace Adler is a mess.
I know a lot of noodle lovers.
And when I tell them what happened at Happy Noodle, they're gonna snub you hard and walk the extra ten feet to Lucky Noodle.
Good-bye.
You hear that?
She's bi.
So, Ellen, swear that you will never eat at Happy Noodles again.
Swear on your mother's life.
Oh, when did that happen?
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
Anyway, don't eat there.
Honey, why?
Why do you care about this so much?
Because at some point in your life, you've gotta start caring about something.
And I'm starting with this.
I know that it seems small compared to homelessness, and the war in Zazamzia But Still, evil exists when good men do nothing.
About noodles.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to walk Bertram home from our date.
That's right.
Walk.
My millionaire believes in being thrifty.
I tell ya, if there was a step he took that didn't have a fart after it, I didn't hear it.
It sounds like this woman in my office.
Boy, can she let 'em rip!
Pew.
Stinky.
Um, so where's Will?
I thought we were all supposed to have dinner together.
He's probably out with Alan.
Ugh.
Those two are meant for each other.
Alan's got a fortune, and Will's got four chins.
Who's Alan?
I don't know this Alan.
Will bagged himself a rich, old dude.
Yep, our Will's a trophy boy.
Meanwhile, all I got was this bus schedule and you do not want to know what I had to do to get this.
You are crazy.
Will would never go out with someone just because they're rich and they could buy him things.
Guys, guess what?
Alan just bought me a horse!
Alan, these are-- These are my friends.
This is Jack, Karen, and Grace.
Hi, nice to meet you.
A pleasure.
Wait 'til you see the cowboy hat.
Will thinks he can't wear it with the new bathing suit, but when he puts on that bolo tie, it just pulls the whole outfit together.
Try it on, Will, let's see what they think.
All I did was say that I liked Stetson cologne, the next thing I know, I've got a hat and a horse.
Yeah?
-Wow.
-Yeah?
It takes me back to the old west.
The old West Village.
Yeah.
Howdy, domestic pardner.
Oop, sorry, gotta run.
I've gotta give the local traffic girl the ass of the local weather girl.
Nice to meet you all.
Uh, Will, I snuck a little something into the Gucci bag.
-It better not have been-- -It might have been.
-You-- Geez.
Oh, God, I don't believe it!
Leather pants!
Oh, Alan, you did not!
I'd have never gone to Hermes if I thought he was gonna buy me everything I pointed to.
What?
You've got a sugar daddy!
What?
!
This is so unfair!
I would do a sugar daddy for a horse.
Hell, I'd do a horse for a sugar daddy!
I do not have a sugar daddy.
I resent the implication.
There is nothing going on here.
I happen to have a wealthy, older friend who--who likes to be in the dressing room when I happen to be trying on swimsuits.
Oh, my God, I have a sugar daddy!
Don't eat here.
The noodles are hot and they charge for them.
Okay, don't eat here.
The noodles are hot and they charge for them.
I don't see the problem.
Look, I don't have time to tell you the whole story.
It's on the flyer.
Okay, I'll read it while I eat my noodles.
Thanks, I appreciate Hey!
Hey, you can't do that in here.
Well, it's cold outside.
Look, you're gonna have to leave.
Fine, but this isn't over.
I've got friends, you know, friends who love cheap Asian food with unisex bathrooms.
-And every single one of them has sworn a solemn oath not to eat here until some serious changes are-- -Honey, I need some more hoisin sauce.
And could you top off my Sprite?
What the hell are you doing here?
!
Stay perfectly still.
Karen, just because you're not moving doesn't mean I can't see you!
Honey, calm down.
So I slipped once.
Here you go, Karen.
And since you've been here every day this week, this one is on the house.
And, oh, be very, very careful.
Hot plate, hot plate.
C'mon, Karen, I'll be lady and you be the tramp.
This isn't about noodles.
This is about supporting your friends.
And if it's important to me, it should be important to you.
Shame on you.
Whew.
Somebody needs to get laid.
Uh, Alan, I-- I want to talk to you.
First, I have a little something for you.
-See, that's what I want to talk about.
-What, I can't hear you when the lid is on.
Alan-- Chanel Apres ski boots?
Shut up!
I've always wanted these and never, ever needed them.
Well, you'll need them now for our little ski vacation in the Swiss Alps.
And don't bother packing, I've got everything you need.
Whee!
No!
No.
No, I can't.
Look, I, uh-- I really appreciate all the gifts, Alan.
And--and everything, but I-- I think you may have the wrong idea about our relationship.
And what would that be?
Well, I don't know.
You give me all this stuff.
Maybe you're expecting something in return.
Something?
Something more than a handshake.
A hug?
A hug with friction.
You think I'm trying to get you into bed?
Well, Alan, come on.
You-- You're a wealthy, older gentleman who appreciates art, and-- And you said yourself, I resemble Michaelangelo's David.
If David was on a strict, low-carb diet.
I also appreciate Sumerian urns, but I never tried to hump one.
Will, I think of you as a friend.
I happen to be very generous with my friends.
If that confused you, I'm sorry.
Alan, I'm so embarrassed.
You know what?
I think we're done here.
You can let yourself out.
And leave the boots.
Is that vodka?
Unbelievable.
Oh, are we drinking?
I'll join you.
Don't bother.
I only drink with my friends.
Oh, come on, honey, I couldn't stay away.
Those noodles are so good.
But that is just the point.
Don't you get it?
This is about taking a stand.
And the only stands that are worth taking are the ones that really cost you.
You think this boycott's been easy on me?
Not a day goes by that I don't think about a big bowl of buckwheat noodles.
wimming in a savory broth, with just a few small pieces of tempura gently floating on the top.
Or one of those round pieces of pork that the edges are still red, and then you--and then you take the little shaker with--with red pepper, I think it is-- and you sprinkle it very, very lightly on-- Oh, the boycott's over.
I'm starving, let's go.
I hope Alan's here.
I want to apologize to him.
II really blew it.
I thought you said nothing happened.
Ha-Ha!
Wak, wak, wak!
What happened with you and Bertram?
Did you get that subway map you had your eyes on?
We broke up.
He wouldn't come out to his mom.
Hey, there's Alan.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
I hope we can get back what we had, you know, a relationship of equals.
Where one of the equals never has to bring a wallet.
Interesting.
You know, I think I did that in snow once.
Hello, Will.
You know, I thought of you just today.
I sent off a contribution to the Howard Dean campaign.
I hope he didn't take it the wrong way.
Okay, I deserved that.
Look, I misjudged you and-- and I'm so embarrassed that I went to such a cynical place.
Oh, thanks, honey.
It-it's just-- I-I've never-- Hi.
I-I've never-- I've never had a friendship with someone like you before, and it's not just the age thing, it's--it's-- Okay, what's going on here?
That is my outfit.
Was Heh.
And Sebastian fills it out so much better.
I'm curvy where it counts.
So, he's-- He's what?
My replacement?
Ohreplacement's such an ugly word.
True, but ugly.
Face it, you're getting to be a little long in the tooth for a boy toy.
I am not!
I could totally be a boy toy.
You keep telling yourself that, grandpa.
Hey, hey, hey There are plenty of people who would buy me.
You know, and-and-- and it wouldn't take any Chanel Apres ski boots either.
There isn't a single old guy here who couldn't have me for a lot less!
What a proud moment for you.
Come on, Sebastian, let's get you tanned Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
I'm 29.
I'll bounce back.
When did this happen?
When did I get too old to be a boy toy?
Oh, Will.
About ten years ago.
But look at the bright side.
You're now the older man with money.
You can actually have a boy toy.
Yeah, right, like-- That is kind of cool.
-I could make some hot young guy my plaything.
-Oh, no, thank you, I think we're better off as friends.
-You're sure?
I'd get you a metro card to go with that bus schedule.
-Ew, no.
Get away from me.
What would you do for a Sunday paper?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
These wedding announcements have become so confusing since they started letting same-sex couples in.
Like, look at that.
Is that two gay men or two lesbians?
I think it's just an unattractive straight couple.
Well, it's just wrong.
I firmly believe marriage should be a contract between two cute people.
Good luck gettin' that through.
Hey!
How was your date last night?
Aww, bobsled brownie.
No second date.
Yes, second scoop.
What?
It was fine.
Will.
You're eating a bobsled brownie.
Clearly your date ran from you.
And now you're drowning your sorrows in well-priced ice cream.
Will, how many times do I have to tell you that a bobsled brownie is not gonna fill the hole where a boyfriend should be?
Oh, wait.
It was a nightmare.
He met someone else during the movie!
Well, I'm glad you're a mess.
I need to ask you a favor.
Remember Leo?
You mean the man you tricked into marrying you?
And then he fled the country?
Yeah, my husband.
Well, he's got this cabin up in Vermont, and the stupid pipes froze.
One of his neighbors called.
And it's like they expect me to go up there and take care of it.
Why would I do that?
Sometimes married people do things for each other, even when they don't want to.
Why am I hearing about this for the first time now?
Will you come with me?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass.
Why?
What have you got going on, Bobsled Brownie?
I have to meet with a new client.
The only reason the firm assigned him to me is 'cause he's gay.
Like I'm the only one who can speak his language.
How insulting.
- So he wasn't that cute?
- Not to me.
And I was hoping.
Jack, will you come up with me?
Oh, I'm sorry, Grace.
I can't.
I'm gonna go see The Boy From Oz.
Yeah, I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman and his huge ackman.
Pun: Copyright, Jack McFarland.
Great.
So what am I supposed to do?
Go up there by myself like an animal?
You could always drug someone and take them up there with you.
Hey, why don't you take Karen?
That--that way you just have to take her up there with you.
Will, hi.
Your 11:00 a.m. is here.
And I'm here too if you need me.
Not just work.
Anything, I'm flexible and limber.
Good to know.
Even on a weekend or Christmas.
Do you have plans next Christmas?
- Of course you do.
Look at you.
- All right, come on.
Mr. LaMarak, hi.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you again.
I know you're a busy man, so-- - Will, have you seen The Lord of the Rings?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm talking, like, all three pictures.
I don't want to screw around with some guy who just showed up for the last one.
No, I was there the first day they came out.
Then again, I'll go to see any movie where boys named Merry and Pippin risk their lives for a good piece of jewelry.
Thank God.
The last firm I was with, they hadn't seen any of them.
I mean, I had nothing to talk to them about.
I had to leave.
Is that weird?
Not at all.
No, I once changed dry-cleaners because they put a plant in front of the autographed picture of Patrick Swayze.
Well, I've had this opportunity to go through your history.
It's really quite inspiring.
The guy who invented stuff in his garage to the CEO of Stuff I Invented in my Garage Industries.
And through it all, you never sold out.
So what is it you want to do now?
- Sell out.
- Pardon?
Yeah, I want to sell it.
I want to sell it all.
Don't want to invent stuff no mo'.
Just wanna sit back and count my monies.
My precious.
See, you got that 'cause you saw it.
Please, saw it?
When Théoden's daughter, Éowyn, took off her helmet, I screamed like an Uruk-hai.
Look, I like the movie, but I'm not a freak, okay?
- Will, clear your desk, 'cause I got a case for you.
It's gonna be the trial of the century.
Hi.
- Hi.
I went to go see the matinee of The Boy from Oz.
And halfway through the second act, I saw a Hugh Jackman do this That's my move.
We're gonna sue!
It's Jack v. Jackman.
I like it.
Good title.
I'm gonna wear a veil and be my own surprise witness.
Well, you certainly have a lot of veils.
- Here's our strategy.
You leave right now, and I'll slam the door.
- Slam it all the way to the bank!
Sorry about that.
He's a little hard to control.
He's product of a broken disco.
Who is he?
Oh, he's my, um What's the best way to describe Jack?
Foxy, vivacious, heaven in blue jeans, and please don't leave out single?
- You're kidding.
- No, I want you to set us up.
I want him to be the lord of my ring.
Whew.
Something about this fresh air.
It's so relaxing.
I think I may have nodded off for a few minutes on the drive up.
Nodded off?
You took a fistful of downers with a bottle of Pino Grigio, and you're out cold for three hours.
I had to stop every 30 miles to pull your tongue out of the back of your throat.
Yeah, well, I used to read in the car, but it made me nauseous.
I don't know about Vermont.
It makes me a bit uncomfortable in a state where you drive by 20 churches and not one temple.
Okay, grab the key.
Leo said it would be under the mat.
Why me?
'Cause you're closer to the floor, Shorty.
Oh, here it is.
Okay, all right, let's get inside.
This place gives me the creeps.
It's like something out of a horror movie.
Promise me, whatever we do, we're not gonna lose our virginity or go skinny-dipping at midnight.
I can't make that promise.
Honey, look.
What an adorable little cabin.
You know, my ex-boyfriend used to have a place like this.
Huh, I wonder whatever happened to Teddy Kaczynski.
We lost touch.
Which is funny 'cause he was such a good letter writer.
Oh, look at this place.
It's so Leo.
Look, canoe paddles.
The mounted fish.
A picture of me.
Oh, God I'm pretty.
Oh, look.
Commemorative inaugural plates.
Eww, who would want to eat off of Nancy Reagan?
I think a lot of people.
She's a very clean lady.
Now, that Lady Bird Johnson.
Ho, stranger to the bathtub.
- God, it's freezing in here.
- I know.
I can see my breath.
So can I, and it says Smirnoff on it.
All right, the plumber can't be here till the morning, so what do you wanna do about dinner?
Well, you may not know this about me, but I do have a bit of a flair for the outdoors.
If you'd like, I could rustle us up some grub.
Karen, you know I'm against hunting.
Oh, Honey, me too.
But I saw a rib joint a few miles back, and there's only one guy covering the register.
Karen, wait!
See if they have cornbread.
Hey.
I just got your message.
You needed to see my ass and pee?
I needed to see you A.S.A.P.
Look, um I'm a little uncomfortable asking you this, but you remember the guy that was in my office today?
He really wants to go out with you.
Hmm, your office.
Guy in your office.
Interesting.
You mean you.
No, Jack, not me.
All right, well Okay, I see.
Let's just call him Will Fruman, okay?
I think Will Fruman is darling and kind with a permanent frown and anger lines that go on for days.
But please tell Mr. Fruman I'm gonna have to decline.
I'll pass it on through his idiot friend Hack McGarland.
I'm talking about my client, Stuart.
Remember?
You said hi.
He said hi back.
You two really seemed to get each other.
No, thanks.
I'm done with men.
who walk like men.
Men are hot.
I miss men.
I'm back on men.
- So you'll go out with him.
- No.
Come on, Jack.
This is a really big client.
And I need to score points with the firm.
I've been still trying to make up for mismanaging the office potluck.
Like I don't hate myself enough for having two ambrosia salads.
Come on, please do this.
Willicent Truman!
Are you trying to pimp me?
Like some common tramp trolling the docks?
Well, I'm here to tell you, there ain't enough money in the world that would make me your ho.
I'll give you this old ChapStick and all the coins in my pocket.
Buy a lady a drink, sailor?
Okay, I'll set something up for Saturday.
That way you'll have enough time to get off sugar and get on Ritalin.
Wait, Saturday.
Um, then who's gonnaover the pre-theater dier rush over at Café Jacques'?
You mean your one tiny table in the hallway?
I'll do it.
All right, I'll go out with him.
But I'm gonna need that ChapStick up front.
Well, I chopped a cord of firewood and tapped a couple of trees, so we've got syrup for the morning.
Brrr, cold winter.
Good thing summer fell on the weekend.
This would've disturbed me more, if I hadn't just seen you whittle a martini glass out of a pine cone.
Oh, Honey, look at you.
I never thought I'd see you in your wedding dress again.
Karen, it's Leo's nightshirt.
I found it in the hamper.
The weird thing is it fits.
I think I've gained a little weight.
Hey, I'm still 50 pounds lighter than every other woman we drove past.
Honey, you got that out of the hamper?
Do you know what that shirt's been through?
A man wearing a flannel nightshirt doesn't have a chance in hell of getting touched by anyone but himself.
What?
I like it.
It even smells like him.
All woodsy and other hamper smells.
It makes me feel safe, like he's here with me.
Yeah, well, keep that thing away from me.
I don't want to itch from anything but my own medications.
Okay, I guess since there's no TV, I'll just go to bed.
Or maybe I'll take advantage of this time and curl up with a good book.
Eh, good night.
One bed, huh?
I must say, you've orchestrated this perfectly, Grace.
This is kind of fun.
You know what I love about the woods?
How you can just go to bed without brushing your teeth.
You like that about Manhattan too, don't you?
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
This bed is awful.
God, it's so lumpy.
Yeah.
It is, Honey, but it's not the mattress.
No, there's money under here.
- What?
- Yeah.
10, 20, 30.
There's at least $42,500 and one roll of quarters.
- What?
I can't believe this.
- I know, right?
Whoo.
- What is Leo doing with all this money, and why is he hiding it from me?
- I don't know, Honey.
This is-- Okay, no--no reason to get all crazy.
This is Leo.
I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation.
Of course there is.
It's Leo.
Like what?
- Well, there has to be a thousand possible reasons.
- Thousands!
Pick your favorite.
Well, I'm sure that he just-- He's--he's probably-- Okay, fine.
I can't think of any.
My husband doesn't trust me.
That's what this is about.
Nice.
Well, I'll tell you something.
This is my money as much as it is his.
And I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna spend my half.
Yeah.
That'll teach him not to trust you.
- That's right.
First thing in the morning, we're hitting the outlets.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Honey, no kiss?
- Oh, sorry.
- Hey, how was the date?
- First things first.
How's was the dinner rush at Jacques'?
Slow for most of the night, and then a party of unicorns came in.
Sowhat was the date like?
Oh, it was great.
Good conversation.
A freewheeling exchange of ideas.
Really?
And where were you during all of this?
Thank you, you really helped me.
- Oh, Jack.
Hi, did you get the flowers ?
- I did.
And they were beautiful.
I sent them back for the cash.
I hope that's okay.
- That's more than okay.
That's adorable.
- Oh, you are.
- You are.
- You are!
- You!
This must be an example of the sparkling conversation you were making.
Uh, Jack, nice to see you.
But, uh, Stuart and I have a meeting.
Oh, Will, I was thinking maybe Jack could stay.
You see, he makes me feel good about a man I like to call me.
Fine, sit down.
Let's get started.
- And, Jack - Don't worry about me.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
Hmm, cheddar.
Heh-heh.
- Okay, on the sale of your company, I've had proposals from several interested parties.
- Pss-pss-psst.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.
Um, could you bring me up to speed?
What exactly are we talking about here?
I just heard the word "sale" and "company".
Stuart is selling his company.
Yeah, I would not have gotten that.
- Sad.
- What, Kitten Fish?
You don't think I should sell?
Well, you love that company.
You worked your whole life for that company.
As a matter a fact, I think that's where you were working when we met.
I can't believe you still remember that.
Will, can you believe this?
Yes, I can.
Because it was yesterday.
Okay, I think the clear frontrunner is this office products company out of Dallas.
They're making a cash for stock offer.
And they'll retain you as a consultant.
All right, well, this looks good.
What?
It's just-- I don't like Dallas.
Isn't there a company in, say-- I don't know, Knots Landing -- that would be willing to buy.
You heard him.
Dallas is out of the question.
What else you got?
Seriously?
I guess I'll have to cancel our proposed acquisition of Falcon Crest Vineyards.
Okay, smells like we're done here.
All right, hey, let's go to Outback Steakhouse.
Jack!
We are trying to do business here.
Now, why don't you go down the hall to the coffee room and run around in a circle?
Like it or not, Jack is a part of this decision-making process.
Why?
Uh, because he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
!
You went out on one date.
Look, you may not approve of our lifestyle.
- But Jack and I are a team.
And if you've got a problem with that, then maybe we should find other representation.
- Oh, please!
He only when out with you 'cause I paid him to!
- What?
- Yes!
I gave him ChapStick and a handful of change.
Jack.
How much change?
I have to go.
Wait, I'll-- I'll go to Dallas.
I'll go to any nighttime soap you want.
Oh-ho.
I always wondered what it would be like to spend $3,000 on apple butter.
Thank you, Leo.
Honey, you really cleaned up that Japanese silverware store.
What are you gonna do with all those spoons?
Eat the $15,000 worth of Ben & Jerry's we bought at the factory.
It's a good thing we don't need a freezer.
The whole state is a freezer.
So, Honey, are you feeling any better?
Well, I don't know, Karen.
I think this may be one of those weird problems that spending money can't fix.
What you talkin' about, Willis?
You just need to spend more.
Come on, let's go buy that historic church and turn it into a gay bar.
Come on.
Karen, no matter how much money I spend, I'm still gonna be left with the same problem.
My husband keeps secrets from me.
He has this whole other life.
It's like I don't even know the person who lives here.
What are you doing in our house?
Honey, look, Leo's here.
And he brought a date.
No.
No, this is Leo Marcus' cabin.
Why else would he have my picture on the mantel?
That's Rita Hayworth.
- Well, a lot of people make that mistake.
- Leo lives next-door.
Who are you?
Oh.
I'm his wife.
Oh, my God, so, so that was your money under the mattress.
How do you know about that?
That's our life savings!
Yes, it was.
And now it's defrosting on the front lawn.
- What?
- Okay.
Silver-lining time, folks.
Yes, yes, I broke into your cabin and spent all your money.
But the good news is, is my husband isn't keeping secrets from me.
Our marriage is secure.
Isn't that wonderful news ?
John, get the gun.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
Calm down.
Use mine.
Hey.
Hey.
Just cleaning.
Yeah.
Heard from Stuart?
He won't take my calls.
I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean to blurt that out.
I know, and I didn't mean to be a jerk in the meeting.
I get carried away when I'm included.
- But you're gonna be okay, right?
It really was just one date.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
It's no big deal.
- I was just going out with him for you.
- That's right.
A bobsled brownie.
Oh, my God.
You really do like him.
How much do I have to eat before the pain goes away?
A lot.
Honey, that was fun.
What misadventures are we going to get into next?
One thing's for sure.
Whenever we're together, wackiness ensues.
Yeah, maybe.
What's up, Honey?
You seem a little blue.
I'm worried.
But there's nothing to worry about.
That wasn't Leo's cabin.
It wasn't his money.
It wasn't his nightshirt.
Eww, that wasn't his nightshirt.
I just hate that I went to such a crazy place.
It's just that if Leo were here, I could've talked to him about it.
And I wouldn't have spun out of control.
But he's not here.
Yeah, but I am, Honey.
And I know what it feels like to have your man be far away.
Ever since Stan died, I barely see him anymore.
And sometimes, Honey-- Can you keep a secret?
You're sweet to me, Karen.
- Thanks for coming up here with me.
- Come on.
This is the least I can do.
- Karen?
- Sorry, something about Vermont.
I don't know.
Congratulations.
You have just sold your company.
I'm sure you and all that money are going to be very happy together.
Yeah.
Well, you can't cuddle money, Will.
Well, you can.
It just doesn't cuddle back.
That's the spirit.
Could you sign again?
There's a tear on the second T. Now that you've done this, um, there's another acquisition I think you should have a look at.
It's about 30 years old.
It's not without it's problems.
It's expensive.
Very high-maintenance.
But I think it's gonna pay dividends for many years to come.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Come on, Stuart.
Yes, Will made me go out with you.
Yes, I did it for all the wrong reasons.
Yes, I had no feelings whatsoever when I went into this.
Let's get past the yes section.
But during the four hours we spent together, something happened.
I fell for you, Stuart.
Stuart Little.
- I think what Jack is trying to say-- - Keep out of this, Miss Match!
Anyway, I understand if you don't want to forgive me.
I-I just wanted to let you know how much I care about you.
Now I'll leave you alone forever.
Out of my way!
Will, stop him!
He's getting so far away!
Jack, stop!
Jack, no one has ever done anything that romantic for me before.
And in front of all these people.
So you'll forgive me?
Yes.
I've always dreamed of two men holding each other tenderly in my office.
I just always hoped one of them would be me.
If you need me, I'll be at Baskin-Robbins.
Honey, is it okay if I nod off for a little while?
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Thanks, good night.
- What, no kiss?
- Oh, sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Excellent dinner, Will.
I'd help with the dishes, but I'm riveted by this week's In Touch.
You mean the B-version of People Cheaple.
There's this article on Mandy Moore and Andy Roddick I'm dying to finish.
I've only gotten through one half of the quarter page.
I don't know.
I think actresses and tennis players are a bad match.
When Agassi was with Brooke Shields, his hair fell out and her show stayed on the air.
It's so cool how Mandy and Andy met.
She said that he was cute, and then his mom called her publicist.
I want someone's mom to call my publicist.
Guys, is this really what it's come to?
All we have to talk about are the lives of celebrities?
Yeah, it's fun.
Get on board.
Mandy and Andy.
No, Grace has a point.
I mean, our lives are just as interesting as those of famous people, like mine, for example.
I'm taking a cooking class.
Don't say it like it's small and pathetic.
I think it's important.
I didn't say it like it was small and pathetic.
I kind of said it like it was a big thing.
I'm taking it with Larry.
- Oh, can I come too?
- Sure.
See what's going on?
We don't need celebrities.
We're talking.
We're sharing.
Things are happening.
So, Jack, why the class?
Why cooking?
Why now?
Well, I don't want to be one of those people that always talks about their boyfriend.
But now that I have a boyfriend, I wanted to cook my boyfriend a home-cooked meal.
Boyfriend!
So, Karen, what's going on in your life?
What's going on?
Ugh, how much time do you got?
My mother moved back to town-- Hmm, that didn't take as much time as I thought.
Karen, if that computer's on, I'm going to be really alarmed.
Kiki!
- Mama!
- Aw, honey.
Grace, Grace.
Aw, look at you.
You look fantastic.
Have you lost weight?
Uh, no, actually, I've gained a little.
Well, obviously I can see that, but it's rude to say it, isn't it?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting up later in the morning for pancakes and beer?
Well, you know, I was working on the apartment.
And I just--I got so depressed.
I mean, it needs so much work.
I think I'm gonna need a professional.
Mama, you're in luck.
Grace is a designer.
Yes.
She's got a great eye for color.
She's good with clients.
And she does amazing things with fabric.
God, Karen, you're so sweet.
But you better have a lot of money in the budget for Egg McMuffins, because Heavy G like to eat.
So what do you think?
Can you help me out?
Well, I do have some time.
I've been working on a bedroom for this Westchester housewife, but I can't really do anything until her stripper pole arrives, so - So what kind of budget are we talking about?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is my mother you're talking about.
Nobody puts my Linda on a budget.
- Lois.
- Yes?
Look, Karen, you have helped me out before, but I want to do this on my own.
Now, listen, Grace, I've got $1,400 to do five rooms.
What can you do for me?
Before I answer that, could I just say how much I admired your old relationship, you know, the one where money was no object.
Let's take another look at that.
Now, Grace, the fact that my mama wants to do this without my help gives me a beautiful feeling.
So does the pill that you take every 15 minutes labeled "beautiful feeling".
So pop another one and give me some more cash.
Come on, Grace, please.
This is important to us.
Please.
How can I resist those sad dilated pupils?
Oh, do we have an early bird?
You're here for the class?
Yes, I'm, uh, I'm Will Truman.
You know, my mom has every single one of your cookbooks.
Would you mind signing one for her?
Her name's also Will.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Now, please, don't be self conscious around my prosthetic finger.
- Oh, I thought it was a real finger.
- Oh, well, it's not.
I believed you before you bit it.
Don't worry.
I didn't lose it in a cooking incident.
It was shot off in our parking lot.
- Oh!
Are you here on your own?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm meeting some friends.
Kind of a guys' night out.
And when we're together, we get a little crazy.
So watch out.
But not messy crazy.
You know, more like tidy crazy.
Oh, welcome, welcome.
Grab an apron.
And, gentlemen, do not be afraid that an apron will make you look girly.
Although sometimes it does.
- Oh, sorry, I brought my own.
- Oh, my.
You don't see embroidery like that anymore.
Thank you.
It's just a basic McCall's pattern.
But I kind of put my own stink on it with the embroidery.
I was something of a stitching prodigy in my--in my early teens.
And, uh, in case it wasn't clear, I'm gay.
- Oh, Don, he's gay.
We should introduce him to your brother.
- My brother's not gay.
He's a workaholic.
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.
- Love the apron.
McCall's?
- Yeah.
Joe, you came.
I thought it was just gonna be Larry.
Well, we're kind of in a love phase.
The seven-year itch sort of scabbed over and fell off.
Now we can't be apart.
My husband, the poet, huh?
Okay, everybody.
Wash your hands.
I do before every class.
Once a week I throw the fake one in the dishwasher.
Will, the sweetest thing just happened.
The lady on the elevator said we were a cute couple.
Well, actually she said, "Stop making out or the fires of hell will consume you".
That's just an expression.
Like "we don't want your kind in our neighborhood" or "there he is, get him".
So you--you brought Stuart.
Well, yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Joe and Larry, my boyfriend Stuart.
Boyfriend Stuart, Joe and Larry.
Boyfriend, boyfriend, boyfriend.
- Wow, everyone's gay.
Your brother and his roommate should take this class.
- He has a roommate because he's a workaholic.
Okay.
Before we get started, why don't we all go around and introduce ourselves.
Please, please.
Okay.
We're Don and Debbie.
I'm Debbie.
We love to cook.
We're big grillers.
Oh, well, we're Joe and Larry.
And we just celebrated our 15th anniversary.
And, well, we have a five-year-old.
Adopted.
I didn't want to lose my figure.
Oh, we are Jack and Stuart.
I'm a pretty stewardess from Omaha, Nebraska.
And this is a businessman I met on a nonstop flight to Sexyville.
I don't want to get all John Wayne on your asses, but, pardner, this one's a keeper.
We'reWill.
Uh, this is my apron.
If you count the blackbirds, you'll note there are 4 and 20.
Okay, all the recipes that we are going to be making tonight serve two.
But you can double the recipe if you're having another couple over for dinner.
Or, Will, in your case, cut them in half.
- You know, uh, I'm not always alone.
- That's right.
His mother was living with him until recently.
Do not go in there.
Oh, honey, again?
See a doctor.
No.
I just sanded the walls and it's all dusty.
I must have peeled up all that awful linoleum.
Good news, underneath all that awful linoleum, awful tile.
- What are you doing?
- You told me to paint.
I'm on my second coat.
Not your nails.
The walls.
Not with nail polish.
With paint.
Not with that brush!
A big brush!
God, honey, stop yelling at me.
You're making me feel incompetent.
Karen, I need help.
I can't afford to hire real workers.
So you and I, we've gotta do it ourselves.
Unless you want to slip me a little more cash.
Come on.
No one has to know.
Get over it, Grace.
You're not getting any more money.
That's the way my mom wants it.
Besides, I've done my fair share.
I hired a burley construction worker to do the heavy lifting.
That's it, lady.
I'm on lunch.
No, really.
It's a prosthesis.
Look.
Nothing.
Now when you've heated your pan, we are going to add two tablespoons of butter.
Will, for you, that's one.
- Four cups of chicken stock.
Will, for you, that's two.
And a teaspoon of salt-- Will, for you, that's-- - Let me guess, half of it?
No, use the whole one.
You're on your own.
You might as well bloat.
Aw, that is just so, so sad.
Look, Jack, will you promise me something?
If in a year, Will is still alone, we'll have him put down?
Thank God for you, Joe.
- I know we can be bitchy to each other-- well, more you to me-- but when I look at Will - Yeah, and, to think, I was so much more into him than you for awhile.
Me too!
What happened to him?
You know I can hear you?
You're looking at me when you say it.
Look, how many times do I have to tell you, I'm fine being alone.
I even prefer it.
You know, I'm here to learn about cooking.
I don't have to be paired up with someone to-- - Sorry, am I too late to be in this class?
- Not at all!
Free spot right here!
Let me get you up to speed.
She's got a fake finger, and I'm single.
Now, lower the flame, uncover the lids, and we'll see how our ratatouille turned out.
- You're an amazing cook.
You know that?
- Adam, I am not.
No, the way you chop that egg plant, it was really sexy.
Would it be too intimate if I fed you?
Would it be too intimate if I cried while you did it?
Just be careful you don't get any on the apron.
Why do you keep looking at the new guy?
Do you think he's sexier than I am?
Of course not.
Come here.
This is a lot of fun.
You know, she also teaches a master class in baking.
We should take that.
Oh, yeah, then we could be master bakers.
We could master bake together.
Maybe my brother is gay.
Well, what'd you think, Don?
The man wears Chinese slippers.
Let's hurry up and eat this so we can get out of here.
Why?
Do you have plans later on?
I was hoping I did.
Really?
Well, um Will, you're gettin' that all over your apron.
I don't care!
Everybody, switch, because it's a good idea to sample each other's work.
Uh, but you may want to sit this out, Debbie.
No offense, but I noticed your cold sore.
- It's not a cold sor-- - Sit down, Debbie!
It's gross.
Well, you seem to be having fun, you dog.
I know.
Ruff!
Ruff!
Ruff!
Yeah, that's the sound a dog makes.
Anyway, we're, uh, we're just happy to see that you found someone.
Jack was saying, if it went on much longer, he's was thinking about buying you a hooker.
That's 'cause he has all those gift certificates.
No, seriously.
He even clipped out an ad from Homo Extra.
- Yeah, right, like he'd ever buy me a hooker.
Like Jack would ever buy-- - 60, 80, 100.
Okay, open your eyes!
Oh, Grace.
This is gorgeous!
I'm amazed that you could do this on such a tight budget.
Well, between Ikea, eBay, and Rosario's bedroom, we were able to pull it together.
I love it.
It's, it's wonderful.
And the best part is I finally have a home where my daughter can visit me.
Oh, Mama.
I feel really good about this.
Like, for the first time in your life, you're actually putting me first before the money, the scams, the passing off of horsehair ponytails as human hair.
It's a good one, isn't it?
I'm proud of you, Mom.
You really have changed.
And I'm proud of you, Karen.
I have never seen you work so hard.
I've never seen you work.
And I'm proud of you, Grace.
Not only has the weight gain made your breasts bigger, - but you've pulled this whole place together with nothing but pluck and the sweat of your brow.
- And a lot of toxic glue.
You'll be fine, just don't buy a canary.
I am never going to leave here.
I just love this apartment.
So does your neighbor.
She was so impressed, she wanted to buy it for something like 100 grand more than you paid for it.
No kidding?
Oh Excuse me.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Well, I'm gonna take her offer.
Get out of this hole and buy a McDonald's in Tokyo.
I mean, it's always been my dream.
Wait a minute.
I busted my hump so you could have a nice home and be closer to your daughter, and now you're just gonna ditch it to make a quick buck?
- I'll cut you in for a third.
- I'm in.
Grace, how could you?
You know how important this relationship with my mother is to me, and now you're abandoning me for a lousy third?
- I'll give you a third of my third.
- Sayonara, Mama-san.
Okay.
That concludes stews and soups for gay men and the occasional straight couple.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I'm gonna hand out some of these evaluation forms.
Um, I'm supposed to leave the room while you fill them out, but I find I get better results if I stay.
So, Will, I hope this isn't out of line, but you up for coming back to my place later?
Well, Adam, I hope this isn't out of line, but are you a filthy whore?
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please.
Let me tell you something.
Will Truman doesn't have to pay for it, okay?
Will Truman just goes months and months at a time without it and then pours all his sexual energy into his embroidery.
Will, what are you doing?
I know you paid this guy.
Couldn't you have at least gotten somebody halfway respectable instead of this piece of rough trade from Skankville.
I'm from Montclair, New Jersey.
Get to a clinic, ho!
I don't need this.
I may be tall, but I still have feelings.
- What was that?
- Oh, come on, Jack.
"60, 80, 100".
I saw you pay him.
Yeah, for this cute little anklet I got Stuart.
Adam makes them to raise money for diabetes awareness.
- But Stuart said you were thinking about buying me a prostitute.
- Oh, Will, I think about that all the time.
So I just let a gorgeous, sweet man who cooks and makes his own jewelry and who was totally into me walk out that door?
No, first you called him a filthy, stinkin' ho, told him to get to a clinic, and then he kind of ran out the door.
Oh, my God!
I promise I'll come back to sponge off my station.
Ugh, poor Will.
That he would go to that place.
Well, what happened to him that he would think that the only way that a guy would be interested in him is if he were being paid?
- It's sad.
- Yeah.
Super sad.
That's why I got him the hooker!
Well, he was bringing the whole class down, you know.
When my husband died, it wasn't soup that comforted me.
It was Adam.
I think he danced at my bachelorette party.
Ours, too!
- Hey, Stu, you got any cash?
Let's see if we can get him to do anything.
- Tons.
I mean, her mother had me renovate her entire apartment for, like, no money.
And then she turned around and sold it for a huge profit.
It just doesn't seem right.
- It's immoral.
- Deceitful.
Unethical.
- We should totally do it.
- We should.
Wait, you would do that with me?
Yeah, I think it's genius.
I buy the properties.
You slap a coat of paint on them.
We turn them around for some serious do-re-mi.
I hate that Julie Andrews doesn't sing anymore.
We'd be in business together again, like when I sold your term papers in college.
You sold my term papers?
Didn't I cut you in?
Eh, it's too late now.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
This is crazy.
Ten years ago, a three-bedroom in Chelsea would be half this price.
I know.
And a two-bedroom in Clinton has nearly tripled in value.
But, oddly, Chelsea Clinton has gotten slimmer.
As an uninterested observer who looks ravishing in white I have a simple query What's going on?
Oh, well, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip.
You know, we buy it cheap, fix it up cheap, and you resell it for not cheap.
We're flippers.
Outrageous!
I want no part of your ruthless, money-grubbing schemes.
You make money.
And who loses?
The big oil companies and President Bush.
I think it's disgusting.
Well, sure we make money, but everyone benefits.
You know, we'll buy for a fair price.
We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit.
That's right.
We're the flippers who care.
And you know how Ben and Jerry's gives five percent of its profits to charity?
Well, we're gonna spend five percent of our profits at Ben and Jerry's.
Hey, kids!
I got the best news and I couldn't wait to share it with you, because you're last on my list.
Lyle Finster and I are back together!
Really?
Didn't you guys break up?
'Cause the last time we saw the two of you, you were taking advantage of him to get back at his daughter, Lorraine.
Meanwhile, you developed real feelings for him in the process, but he no longer cared.
Oh, Jackie.
I love when you recap.
He decided to forgive me.
He's back, he's moved in, and we're shagging like two lieutenants after lights out.
That's beautiful.
It's just like An Officer and a Gentleman, when Richard Gere comes back at the end to get his guy-- Girl.
And he carries him-- Her Out of the bath house.
Bus Factory Oh, Jackie.
I'm in love.
And with the sweetest most adorable gal.
Guy So, did you have a busy day, darling?
Oh, the usual.
Putting out fires, starting new ones, pissing in the wind and such.
You businessmen and your legalese.
It's all so complicated.
And now, what about you love?
Thank you, Manuel.
What have you got planned for today, my darling?
Just catching up on my knitting Every Easter for all of the servants, I crochet tiny little bunnies with their salaries on them.
Oh, I bet they love that.
Yes, they do.
And it's a special gift, because it comes from me.
Hey!
Time to sit is time to knit.
Get on it stitch.
What a coincidence.
One knitting needle for each of your eyes.
Oh, darling, what did I ever do to deserve you?
I guess, somewhere in my wicked, miserable past, there must have been a moment of truth For here you are, standing there, loving me.
Whether or not you should For somewhere in my youth or childhood, I must have done something, something good.
something good.
Oh, darling, promise me it will always be this way.
That we'll always spend our mornings over coffee and enjoying an impromptu song.
I promise, though spontaneity makes it harder to incorporate footwear.
Ms. Karen.
You're gonna lose it.
Whaddaya talk?
Wild horses couldn't kill this buzz.
I wouldn't count on it.
Lorraine Finster!
You got a lot of nerve coming here!
How did you even get in?
I would have thought the toothbrush hanging over the door would have scared you away.
Oh, that's what that was.
What are you doing here?
What's it look like I'm doing?
Turning tricks for Tootsie Rolls?
I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here.
Hello, mother!
Thanks for walking me, Stuart.
The streets are really tough out there for a boy alone Ironically, they're tougher for two boys together.
Wow, I'm really impressed you're working with patients already.
Oh, though.
As a student nurse, I can't technically touch them, treat them, or care for them.
But I can look kindly at them and be thankful I'm not them.
And that's the best medicine of all.
Well, I'll see you tonight.
Kiss you then!
Good morning!
My name is Jack and today we're going to play everybody's favorite game Dead or Alive!
Zandra!
I'll give you ten bucks to unplug me.
Zandra, it's me.
Jack McFarland.
Remember?
I'm your former acting class protégé.
I'm a student nurse now.
Yeah, I really feel like I found my calling, so don't even try to talk me back into acting.
If I start to, you put a finger right into my brain!
So, how are you?
Are you dying?
You looking like you're dying.
I'm not dying, jerk.
I'm getting out of here today.
Oh.
So are you going home?
No.
A slot finally opened up in the Actors' Retirement Village.
I waited twenty years and then fortune smiled.
Last week, someone was smothered in their sleep.
So, are you thinking about selling your old place?
What's it to you, chimp?
I have the perfect buyers!
I'll introduce you to them, and then I'll help you move.
I'll be by at eight.
Great.
Maybe I'll be dead by seven.
Oh, Zandra!
I wish everybody who died in that bed had your sense of humor.
Please, daddy.
I have nowhere to go.
I've lost everything my job, my apartment.
I am naked under this coat.
Poor dear.
Sit down, sit down.
Let us talk about it.
May I take your coat?
Forget it!
I don't want her sticking to my furniture.
But, darling, I thought you were doing so well in the chorus of Taboo, the Boy George musical, that you were bunking with Boy George?
Well, I was, but because the show closed, he kicked me out.
Well, that and he found me in a three-way with Simply Red and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
Hit the road, you syphillitic toad.
Karen, if there's one thing I will not tolerate, it's rhyming insults.
Sow.
Cow.
Runt.
Stop it!
Daddy please?
The streets are an awfully hard place for a girl like me.
Please, can you find it in your heart to take me in?
Brava.
That's quite a performance, Lady Macbreath.
But they ain't nobody buying it Karen, the girl has nowhere to go.
I mean, She's my only child.
Well, the only pretty one.
Let her stay for me.
Oh, Finny, you gentle giant.
How can I say no to a face like that.
All right, fine, she can stay.
Super!
But she has to drink from the hose and any trick she turns, the house gets thirty percent.
That is not fair!
The industry standard is fifteen!
Fifty years in one apartment.
Whew.
A lot of memories, huh?
I still remember the night that Don Ameche tied me to this radiator with my bra.
Hello-oooo?
Why do you do that?
Why do you put too many O's on your "hello"?
I don't know-oooo.
Oh, hey you guys.
Come on in!
Ooh, Jack, you were right.
This is great.
A lot of potential.
Who are you?
!
Zandra, this is Will and Grace.
They're my best friends.
Her husband abandoned her.
His never existed.
Will and Grace, Zandra.
Hi.
We actually met last year.
I, uh, I took one of your classes.
You helped me get through to a very honest place, really excavating those layers that kept me buried emotionally.
Oh, the crying fag!
That's him.
Anyway, thank you.
Hi.
It is such an honor to meet you.
We brought you chocolate and flowers.
Here are the flowers.
Zandra, we would like to make you an offer.
An offer?
Zandra, now you don't have to be buried in a drawer.
Ok, here are my terms.
Either you give me two thousand more than what I paid fifty years ago, or there is no deal.
Wow.
Two thousand whole dollars.
Let me just confer with my colleague here.
Oh my God!
This is a great deal!
I can't believe it!
No, no wait.
Aren't we taking advantage of her?
Aren't we the flippers who care?
You're right.
We should do the right thing.
We have to Zandra.
Two thousand is way too little.
We're gonna give you two thousand two hundred.
And a pen.
Suckers.
I already have a pen.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I brought you guys together.
Shouldn't I get ten percent commission?
You're absolutely right.
And ten percent of two thousand two hundred is two dollars and twenty cents.
Wow.
This is nice.
It feels good, work.
Rolling up your sleeves, getting dirty.
And how would you know?
I sanded, I painted, I brought in all the furniture.
All you did was sit on your ass and plow through a bag of Doodles.
Hey, I'm an artist.
Do you know how many Ho-Ho's Picasso went through when he was painting Guernica?
Well, whatever it takes.
It's a great design.
The place looks amazing.
And we are gonna make a fortune!
Let's clap on that.
Ow!
You did it hard!
You did it hard!
Hey, hey!
Lookit here!
Zandra!
The old dame wanted one last look before cataracts took her sight entirely.
Oh, my, this is so pretty.
It's just like when I bought it.
Look here, this is where Robert Mitchum dry-humped me when we were on dope.
Well, another Cold Case file solved.
You know what?
I've changed my mind.
About what?
I want my home back!
Wait a minute!
What about the Actors' Retirement Village?
It's so fun there, with all the famous actors, who lost all their money getting swindled by their business managers, and now their only source of amusement is passing gas and pulling the covers over their head?
Fun!
I hate it.
Adam West never locks the bathroom door.
You hear that?
She can't walk down the hallway without getting a peek at the batpole.
Now, come on, give her the place back!
No!
I'm sorry, but she sold it to us.
I thought you were the flippers who care?
We still care.
If anything, we care more.
You're going to that home, lady!
You remind me of Lucille Ball.
I hated Lucille Ball!
You two are really something!
Kicking an old woman out her home A place were dozens of dead actors molested her.
And for what?
Money!
I hope you're happy.
Let's go, Zandra.
You've been screwed in this apartment enough!
Morning, darling.
Oh.
Morning.
Coffee magically appeared again today.
Would you like some?
Oh, love some.
Yes.
I don't know why I slept so late.
The last thing I remember is eating that oatmeal cookie.
Rosie puts roofies in them.
I hate raisins.
Anyway, I'm sorry I passed out.
I was looking forward to making love to you.
Oh, you did.
Ugh.
Couldn't you do that somewhere else?
People eat in here I don't want to see a sixty-year-old man making out with my father.
Lorraine, that is no way to greet Karen.
Sorry, daddy.
Morning, mother!
Lorraine.
Could you please tone down that British accent?
It makes me nauseous this early in the morning.
Darling, I have a British accent.
For which I take Dramamine.
Muffins?
I don't like muffins!
I want chocolate pudding for breakfast.
Lorraine!
These muffins have been specially designed to keep you regular.
There are two things I will not tolerate in this house!
Racism.
And constipation.
Yeah, you're the Rosa Parks of pooping.
I want chocolate pudding!
Listen, English leather face-- No, no no.
Let me-- Let me Karen.
Thank you, darling.
Now, look.
Chocolate pudding it is.
Thank you, daddy!
I'll be in the TV room.
Make one of the servants bring it in on their head.
Sure.
I know how much that amuses you.
Darling.
You have got to set some limits for your daughter.
You have to tell her "no" once in a while.
Believe me, I know.
I am raising two step-children of my own.
But your step-children went back to their mother.
Yes.
But when they came and begged to stay with me, in the home where they'd grown up, I said "No".
I can see how difficult that must have been for you.
But Lorraine and I are re-establishing our relationship, and I really want her to like me.
Darling, she's not looking for a friend.
She's looking for a father.
You must give her some discipline.
But, how do I discipline a thirty-two-year-old woman?
Pretend she's two sixteen-year-olds.
Well, we're excited too, and we look forward to getting your offer.
They're making an offer?
They're making an offer.
Four frickin' offers?
!
Unbelievable!
Stop it!
Getting rich is fun.
People that say money doesn't buy happiness, they're just not trying hard enough.
Money isn't ruining us, is it?
I mean, we're still good people, right?
We're still the flippers who care?
Well, of course.
Why would you even ask that?
I don't know.
I mean, we did sort of steal this place from Zandra and force her into a home.
What force?
Getting into that place has been a dream of hers.
She's wanted to die there her whole life.
That's true.
We did a good thing.
We're good people.
And there they are.
The most dangerous thing to happen to old ladies since Ashton Kutcher.
That is a joke that both entertains and teaches.
The important thing to bear in mind is that Jack is very, very upset.
Zandra is miserable in that Actors' Retirement Village.
Those people are freaks.
They were all character actors when they were young.
Do you have any idea what they look like now?
All bug-eyes and gap teeth still thinking they're nosey neighbors and wise-cracking best friends.
You sure you weren't looking into a mirror?
Go ahead, laugh!
But know this.
That money is cursed.
You took advantage of that sweet, gentle lady.
What's that above your eye?
She put a cigarillo out on my forehead.
Shame on you!
Wow, this place is fantastic.
Stuart, please.
Don't be so adorable when I'm trying to be mad.
I'm serious, sweetie.
I just think this place would be perfect for a certain couple I know.
One's a tall drink of water and the other one's much shorter and very thirsty.
I think we should take the next step.
I'm not ready for you to see me in drag.
I want us to live together.
I want to buy this place and make it our home.
For reals?
!
Wait-wait-wait wait a minute.
We'd love to sell it to you, but we already have four offers.
Well, five if you count that homeless guy.
And I think he just wanted to use the bathroom.
Wait.
Did he leave?
Well, listen.
I'll match your best offer and I'll sweeten the deal with a tin of my world-famous peanut brittle.
Well, I don't know.
I'm not sure Oh my God, this is really happening!
Do I have to chip in?
Not a penny.
Oh my God, it's really happening!
Wait a minute, what about Zandra.
You said that she hated the Actors' Retirement Village.
Oh, screw her.
She got in with the Gabor clique, she's fine.
I'm a bride!

Hello, mother!
Oh, well, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip.
we'll buy for a fair price.
We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit.

We're the flippers who care.
So, are you thinking about selling your old place?

I have the perfect buyers!

They're my best friends.

The place looks amazing.
And we are gonna make a fortune!

I'm a bride!
Will & Grace 6x16 "Flip-Flop part 2" Would you look at that great big, beautiful city.
You know, they say there's a crime committed here every six seconds.
Should we wait?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
There it is.
Wow, three seconds.
Way ahead.
Helloooo!
Oh, hey, Will!
I love when you add "O"s onto your hellos.
It's, like, my favorite thing you do.
Yeah, its true.
We talk about it all the time.
Really?
Oh, that's good.
I-I-I was toying with getting rid of it, but now I know it has a following.
I just came by to drop off this paperwork.
You are now Oh, isn't that great?
Do you remember when gay people weren't allowed to be in escrow?
And, to celebrate, little pre-housewarming gift, the Whirlybird popcorn maker.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I didn't, I had two of them.
I just thought it'd be a good gift for all those nights you guys'll be hanging out here at home, renting movies, eating popcorn.
Oooh, I know.
I can hardly wait.
Soon as I've washed my hands 17 times, I'm gonna take it out of the box.
I envy you two.
Not having to go to the clubs.
Not having that moment at the end of the night where you look around during last call, and everybody's paired up except for you and one trollish-looking guy.
You figure, what the heck, and you go over to him, and he says no.
That--that happened to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
Happened to a friend of mine too Well, anyway, I gotta get going.
Why-why don't you, uh, sit with us for a bit?
Hang out.
It'll be fun.
Oh, okay.
Well, that was fun.
See ya!
Hey, thanks a lot.
What?
Why are you smiling?
Did he fart?
I was just thinking about what Will said.
You know, he's right.
Well, of course he's right.
What self-respecting troll would go home with Will at the end of the night?
No, no, not about that.
About us.
About how lucky we are.
I mean, we are set.
There's nothing left for us to do except sit back and grow old together.
I don't know about you, but this girl ain't growin' old.
No, that's why I take care of myself.
I eat right, I exercise, and I take a multivitamin to avoid iron-poor blood like Evonne Goolagong.
You don't have to worry about that anymore.
You got the guy, give up the gym.
Yeah, but I've been doing cardio ever since I was nine.
now you don't have to anymore.
You can finally stop running.
Darling, are we being robbed?
Can you see who it is?
No, it's too dark.
You stay there, Karen.
I'm pretty good with this thing.
You don't have to tell me about that.
Oh, shoot.
I thought it was someone trying to kill us.
What are you doing?
You scared me half to death.
Well, what are you doing?
I mean, it's the middle of the night.
I know that.
I'm drunk, not stupid.
Now, keep it down.
I've had a very rough night.
I had to walk 140 blocks back from the Yankee Stadium after I lost your limo.
You lost my limo?
Oh, relax.
I didn't misplace it.
I lost it in a bet.
I mean, who knew Hideki Matsui could hit a baseball further than me?
Finny, are you hearing this?
It's one thing that she doesn't clean her room, but now she's lost our limo to the Asian Willie Mays.
Lorraine, this time you have gone too far.
Daddy gonna crack the whip.
It's all right.
I'll handle this, thank you.
Now, look, you are disrespectful.
And you are irresponsible.
And you need to learn that your actions have consequences.
Okay?
So-- You are going to pay for Karen's limo out of your own money.
Or try winning it back using this house as collateral.
Like hell I will.
You'll do as I say, and you'll like it, young lady!
I rather like this, Karen.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's too late for you to be a father.
You don't care about me, and you never did.
I'm gonna go and get a place of my own.
You're never gonna see me again!
I thought you were cool!
Boy, you really showed her.
Felt good, huh?
Oh, I--I've made a horrible mistake.
What?
Well, I was finally building a relationship with her, doing all the things that I never got the chance to do before.
Like the other day when she fell down and skinned her knee, I was there to kiss her boo-boo.
Of course, I may now have hepatitis, but it--it brought us closer.
Now she's gone, and I've ruined my liver for nothing.
Are you implying that it's my fault that she left?
Of course it's your fault!
You can't stand me getting closer to her.
You're always driving a wedge between her and me.
And that's been your plan all along!
No, Darling.
I've been like a mother to that girl.
I've locked her in her room, I've told her she was fat, and once I even left her in a store.
Well, let me tell you something.
Last time I chose you.
This time, I'm choosing my daughter.
But Finny, no Good-bye, Karen.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, thank God you're home.
You will not believe what just happened.
You washed a dish?
I got a call on Zandra's place.
Someone offered the most insane amount of money.
How insane?
If the money were a person, it'd be Courtney Love.
Did--did you tell them that the place was already sold?
No, I said that I would talk to you about it.
Grace, we can't.
We're in escrow.
Oh, escrow.
What is escrow?
You know what it is.
They've already put up the money.
I thought it was something else.
What's "force majeure"?
Grace, the place is sold, okay?
Stuart bought it.
Besides, we're the flippers who care, remember?
That's our motto.
Read your coffee cup.
Why do you think I had these made?
You know, if we start screwing our friends over, we can never drink from these mugs again.
You're right.
You're right, I--I think I just got caught up in all that money.
Just out of curiosity, how insane was that offer?
Oh, my God!
That's Courtney Love and Margot Kidder!
On a hike with Anne Heche!
No, no, no, it's-- Yes, it's a lot of money, but we-- You cannot put a price on integrity, right?
I don't think Stuart and I should live together.
I never thought you should!
And you know, it's not too late to get out of escrow.
Do you want to know why?
Not really.
I mean, I-I'm sure you've thought about it.
You're a smart guy.
Listen, is Stuart still in the apartment?
'Cause we could undo this thing right now.
Will?
I think we should hear him out.
No.
Grace, he's made up his mind.
He doesn't want to take the apartment.
We're not gonna-- not gonna force majeure 'im.
Hey, I don't know what happened.
I was there with Stuart in that apartment, and he was talking.
And all of a sudden, we were old.
There were cats, and housecoats, and CBS.
And keeping tissues up our sleeves.
I don't think I'm ready to be an old married lady.
Does somebody have a shawl?
It's really chilly in here.
Jack, everyone gets nervous when they move in with someone.
It's totally normal.
Like me.
When I moved in with Leo, I was really nervous.
And you know what?
Never shoulda done it.
You're right.
We're moving too quickly.
I'm gonna go talk to Stuart.
I hope this doesn't affect our friendship if we back out of the deal.
Oh, how would you even ask?
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks, you guys, bye.
Whoo hoo!
Let's get him on the phone.
Money-money-money-money Money!
I guess on the beach towels, we should change it to "Flippers Who Don't Give A Crap".
Oh, Rosie, I miss Lyle so much.
Or do you just miss the idea of Lyle?
No, I miss Lyle.
But hey, good insight, lady.
Well, in El Salvador, I was three credits short a Masters in Psychology.
Well, I'm glad you came here to mop up my sick off the floor instead.
Hey, Karen, get in.
Why should I?
I got your limo.
I won it back from Hideki Matsui in a secret underground Iron Chef contest.
Come on, get in.
all right But only because I've been walking for blocks, and my feet are killing me.
Oy, me too.
Not you, Rosie.
So, what are you doing here, Lorraine?
You've taken your father away from me, and now you've come to rub it in my face?
I haven't come to run anything in anyone's face.
I already tipped the driver.
No, I just came to apologize.
I was awful.
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute.
When we are in my limo, we listen to Soft Hits 106.
Continue.
Well I guess I was just scared.
You know, I just found my dad.
And--and it felt like you were taking him away from me.
well, you won.
He's all yours.
What do you mean?
All he talks about is you.
He does?
Well, where do you think I'm taking you, you gin-soaked old crone?
Lorraine, why are you being so nice to me?
Oh, because I hate this.
You're sad, he's sad.
Nobody's any bloody fun anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, it hasn't been as much fun around the manse either, without you there.
if only I could put into words how I feel.
I love this song.
A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home When there's no one there to hold you tight, and no one there you can kiss good night.
I'm glad we didn't invite Rosie.
I knew as soon as you said that to Jack, you were doing the wrong thing.
I was just helpless to stop you.
You jumped onboard.
You made the final sale.
You hypnotized me with your Svengali-like powers.
And yet I can't get you to stop biting your toenails.
How else do you get them shorter?
Hellloooo.
I'm glad you guys are both here.
Yeah, we have something that we need to tell you.
We did an awful thing.
We really did.
The reason we said you shouldn't live together is that we got another offer on this place for a lot more money.
And it was just really wrong of us.
The truth is, you guys are a great couple.
And nothing would make us happier than to see you two set up house together.
It really would.
Why did you point on that one?
It seems the shoe is on the other foot now, doesn't it?
I don't know what you mean exactly.
I think I might have put my Uggs on backwards.
The difference between the toes is really subtle.
I think what Jack's saying is that we were starting to feel little uncomfortable about moving in together so quickly.
It seemed kind of lesbian of us to fall in love and shack up right away.
Yeah, so, if you don't mind, I don't think we're gonna take the place.
I guess--I guess you can take that other offer now.
that's the furthest thing from our mind right now.
Our biggest concern is your happiness.
So, see ya.
Hurry up, call them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Are you kindding?
I was dialing in my pocket as he was talking.
Hi, hi, it's Will Truman.
Right, listen, I've got some great news for you, uh, if you're still looking for an apartment.
Money, money, money, money Oh, you did?
No, that--that--no, that's okay.
I--I understand.
Money?
They bought another place.
You know what?
Maybe we deserve this.
Maybe this happened because we are supposed to learn a lesson.
Maybe the flippers who care are supposed to care a little more.
What are we gonna do with this apartment?
Anyway, Zandra, we're-- we're really sorry we tried to kick you out of your home.
And all we're asking for is-- is what we put into the place.
That's very fair of you, Homo.
I'm so glad to be out of the Actors' Retirement Village.
Finally I can take a tub without Charlotte Rae staring at me.
those-- Those are some Facts of Life I could've done without knowing.
The--what?
The--the place fell through?
Well, no, no, of course it's still available.
Zandra, your bag's still in the hallway, right?
Now, look, as we're playing for money, I should warn you, I'm extremely good at this.
Anyone else you'd like me to hit?
Another drink please, barman.
Hello, sailor.
Look, I've only got a hundred dollars-- Karen?
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?
I want us to be together.
And I know you want it too.
But I--I don't see how it's possible.
I mean, I can't have the two women that I love most in the world going at it like Italians.
Well, don't say it like that.
It makes us sound so garlicky.
But we've been doing some thinking.
And we've realized that the reason we fight so much isn't because we're different.
It's because we're the same.
That's right.
We're both money-grubbing, sex-starved women who are ofttimes mistaken for transvestites.
And if that's not reason enough to build a relationship, I don't know what is.
Look, I can't guarantee that we won't fight.
But we're two women who love you, and want you to be happy.
Is that such a bad thing?
No, I suppose not.
Three women would be better, but two's a start.
I'm gonna leave you two alone.
I'm gonna head back to my seedy little hotel room, which ironically was quite nice before I moved in.
No, Lorraine, wait.
Come back to the manse.
Stay as long as you want.
Really?
Thanks.
How 'bout you, stretch?
You coming too?
Oh, well, it doesn't seem proper, the three of us living together without benefit of marriage.
Did I just hear a proposal?
No, but now you've made it awkward.
Good heavens, I wanted to marry you the first time I set eyes on you.
Karen, before God, before these toothless whores and aging alcoholics, before my daughter, I proclaim my love.
Will you marry me?
Of course I will, Lyle.
That is how you pronounce it, right?
Yeah, Lyle, yeah.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Finally, the old man's getting married.
And congratulations to you too, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
God, Karen, your engagement ring is so gorgeous.
Wow.
I wanna ring like that.
Maybe I should marry Finster.
Or maybe I should just marry Martin Katz, jeweler to the stars.
It is pretty, isn't it?
I just wish it wasn't so big.
I'm afraid it's gonna leave a mark on Rosario's cheek when I smack her for no particular reason.
You're concerned about the help.
Is something bothering you?
Oh, it's just-- This is all happening so fast.
Every since Finny and I got engaged, I've been having the most disturbing dreams.
Oh, Karen, that's completely normal, yeah.
- A lot of the times, 12-year-old boys like yourself have what we nurses call "Nocturnal"-- - Oh, not those kind of dreams.
Those I like.
No, in these dreams, I'm in my wedding dress, and a disapproving hippo is cross-examining me on the witness stand.
What do you think it means?
Well I was going to say it has something to do with Stan's feelings about your engagement but obviously that's not it, because the hippo in the courtroom is clearly Will.
- So-- - No, no, no.
Oh, honey, it is.
It is Stan.
His stomach is poking out at me from the other side.
- Oh, what if he thinks I'm getting married too fast?
Oh, honey, I wish I could talk to him!
- But Karen, you can.
- What?
- Aren't you familiar with John Edward, from TV's "Crossing Over With John Edward"?
He reunites people with their dead loved ones.
And he wears fitted shirts tucked into his jeans, which is very brave for a three-camera format.
Uh-uh.
Every since my role as "Bank Teller" on "Mama's Family" was left on the cutting room floor, I don't do TV.
Oh, Karen, you don't have to go on the show.
He's signing copies of his new book After Life at Barnes & Noble.
Yeah, we could talk to him there.
Oh, well, I guess I could give it a shot.
"Would you like it in fives, tens or fifteens"?
Can you believe that got cut?
!
- Is Grace here?
- Oh, honey, no, I'm sorry.
She left.
But you might try her at our Paramus location.
I can't believe what just happened.
Y-y-you know how Grace and I have been flipping properties together?
You mean your new version of having sex with each other?
Yeah.
So yesterday we put a bid in on this East Side townhouse.
We're this close to closing, and then this morning we get scooped by D & M Properties.
Did you say D & M Properties?
Oh, honey, you do not want to go up against them.
That's Deirdre and Monet.
The flipping dykes.
These ladies are vicious.
Mess with their livelihood, and they come down on you hard.
And your only warning is the "click click click" of their Manolos.
- You're crazy.
Besides, we have a foolproof lead on the East Side nobody even knows about.
- Oh, they know.
They couldn't.
It's Grace's Aunt Honey's condo.
It's not even listed.
And because of her glaucoma, she doesn't even realize what a bad deal she's getting.
Shh-shh-shh shh-shh-shh-shh.
Hear that?
- I'm scared.
- You should be.
- Good morning.
- Ah!
Lesbian realtors!
You must be Will.
Hello, I'm Deirdre.
And it's good to see you again, Karen.
Stay back, bulldozer!
I'm engaged.
You were last time too.
I've also found someone.
Meet Monet, my new associate.
One of the hottest young designers in the city.
Hello.
Stop looking at him.
You're with women now.
- I was just saying hello.
- You were gushing.
We hear that you and Grace have made quite a name for yourselves on the West Side.
Kudos.
- Thank you.
- No.
I see you have a box of Kudos on your desk.
- Oh.
Would you like one?
- No, no.
We don't eat.
She likes me frail.
Does this story have an ending, Monet?
We're very happy for your success on the West Side, but just so there's no confusion, the East Side is our territory.
What, did you pee at every corner of it?
For your information, we are on the verge of acquiring a property there.
Yes, about that.
We spoke to Aunt Honey, and she's no longer as eager to sell to you.
- How did you know-- - They know everything, Will.
Because they don't sleep with men, their other senses are heightened.
Now, stay off the East Side.
You and Grace have a lovely co-op.
I would hate to see a needle exchange open up next door.
Or a Bennigan's.
- Good-bye.
- Keep it in your pants, Monet.
I'm sorry, I need food.
I already burned off that Tic Tac.
Who can I make this out to?
Jack McFarland.
It's such an honor to meet you.
I love your show.
You're, like, my favorite medium.
Although, in person, you look more like a Large.
Hello, arms.
Thank you for noticing.
Just because I talk to the dead doesn't mean I can't look good.
Right.
Who can I make yours out to?
Oh, um, I'm not here for that.
I need you to get through to my late husband, Stanley Walker.
You see, I'm engaged.
Nice rock.
What is that, Martin Katz?
Damn, you are good.
No You see, I can't go through with the wedding unless I have Stanley's blessing.
And, um, could you get me through to Jude Law?
- He's not dead.
- Yeah, I know, but I would like to make contact with his other side.
I'm not doing any readings here today.
But it sounds like you just need to get in touch with your own feelings and emotions.
Trust your heart.
Spare me the mumbo-jumbo about heart and feelings.
I am a rational, thinking woman, and I have come here to talk to a ghost.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you today.
Oh, well, thanks for nothing, John Edward.
And to think, I almost voted for you.
Hey, uh, when I die, you wanna grab dinner?
- Flipping dykes?
- Flipping dykes!
- Flipping?
- Dykes!
I thought that was a myth.
Like the weapons of mass destruction.
- No, they're real.
- Well, what do we do?
Do we back off?
No, no, no, no.
That apartment belongs to us.
I'm not gonna let a couple of Ellen-lovin', Jenny Shimizu calendar-buyin', Uggs in the summertime-wearin', lady lovers scare us off.
But how can we compete with two hot women?
I mean, look at us.
We're barely one hot woman.
Uh, speak for yourself.
They are a power couple, there's no doubt about it.
So I think our only hope is to divide and conquer.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
It means if we can break them up, then their stranglehold on the East Side will crumble, and the only thing they'll be flipping is burgers.
Yes.
What's our plan?
Look, on Animal Planet, why is it that the pumas always single out the one limpy gazelle for dinner?
Ugh, there's gonna be nature in our plan?
- Because he's the weak one.
- Ah Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, so between Monet and Deirdre, which one's the weak one?
Monet.
She was totally checking me out.
She's no lez.
Oh, sure, when it was chic, she jumped on the bandwagon, but one little push, she'll be back on the man-wagon.
Okay, look, we'll have them over.
And we'll pretend like we're proposing a truce.
Then at some point, I get the weak one in a clinch, you and the tough one walk in, tears, drama, finger-pointing, hair-pulling, we're done.
- Oh, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.
If the Macarthur Foundation gave out Evil Genius Grants, you would so win one.
- It is pretty awful.
- Mm-hm.
To evil!
Come on, Karen.
You're not seriously thinking of calling off your engagement, are you?
Well, I don't know what else to do.
I don't have Stanley's blessing.
And if that psychic John Kerry can't put me in touch with him, then who can?
It's too bad too.
Lyle was a really good guy.
He was.
But don't give up!
I love you two as a couple.
Can I have your ring?
- Okay.
Well, good night, Kare.
- Good night.
- I love you.
- Mmmm.
Love you less.
And who knows, Karen?
Tonight might be the night that you hear from Stan.
I hope so.
Karen - It's Stan.
- What?
Stanley, oh, my God!
Stanley!
You have my blessing to marry Finster.
- I do?
- Yes.
- See ya.
- Wait, oh, wait!
Wait!
Stanley, come back!
Tell me, what's heaven like?
Uh, it's It's like a long room.
Kind of like a hallway.
With a credenza and fancy wallpaper.
Oh, and there goes Rosie.
Hey, girl!
Oh.
Anyway, where was I?
Oh, yeah-- Your order comes to 8.79.
Thank you, please drive around.
Good save, Burger Queen.
Oh, Jackie, how could you?
You know that heavenly voices speak to me every night over the intercom, and you abused that knowledge!
You have really crossed a line this time.
I can never forgive you.
- Can I sleep over?
- Yeah, but no pajama bottoms.
- Okay.
Anyway, thanks for coming over tonight.
We knew if we just sat down and talked, we could get past this silly rivalry.
Rivalries are stupid.
Except for the whole Hilary Duff/Lindsay Lohan thing.
That seems legitimate.
- Yes, I have to tell you, this is a new thing for us.
We rarely go out.
- She likes me pale.
Anyway, about that whole Aunt Honey thing, we're sorry we were on your turf.
I guess I just figured since she was my favorite aunt, if anyone was gonna rob her blind, it would be me.
Well, Grace, there's no room for emotion in business.
Or anywhere in life.
- More wine, Monet?
- Wup-up.
No, she's fine.
- But I want some wine.
- I said enough.
Grace, this apartment is wonderful.
My husband and I had one just like it.
Until I fell in love with his sister.
- Are the bedrooms large?
- Mine is.
I'll bet it is.
Grace, could you help me with something in the kitchen?
Heh-heh Don't forget me when I'm gone.
Settle down, you're making a fool of yourself.
What are you waiting for?
Make your move.
Go for the weak one so we can walk in and catch you.
I will, I just have to figure out a way to get her in the bedroom.
She's a designer.
Ask her opinion on something.
Right, right.
Ooh!
I'll ask her what she thinks of my new dust ruffle.
Great.
And then you can show her the scarf you're knitting and give her a list of the movies that make you cry.
Be a guy, you big 'mo!
- So, Monet-- - I'd love to.
- All right!
So, I guess we should sit down for, like, anywhere from two to five minutes.
Oh, look.
You need more wine.
- Oh, that's okay.
I think I've had enough.
- No, no, no, please.
There is nothing sexier than a beautiful woman with a glass of wine in her hand.
Deirdre, when you're right, you're right.
So, this is it.
This is where it all happens.
Yeah, this baby has seen me through some pretty wild times.
I am talkin' wuh-ild.
Damn it!
I have told that cleaning woman a thousand times, what's the point of having a dust ruffle if you can see metal?
I mean, uh Dust ruffle.
- So, uh, where were we?
- Shut up and french me.
There was a time when I thought about being a lesbian, but it seemed like a lot of extra work.
Well, it is a commitment.
Oh, I-- Hey, I forgot.
Where's Will and Monet?
- You know what, we should probably go check on them.
Why don't you walk into the room ahead of me?
- No, forget them.
I want you.
- Huh?
- Be my partner.
Look, I thought I made it clear about all the extra work and everything.
I mean, I just like to lay there.
No, my design partner.
Monet is fine.
I mean, no one does more with black and cement, but how many apartments can you sell to Moby?
Oh Well, I'm kind of already partners with Will.
God, well, imagine what the two of us could do together.
God, your hair is gorgeous.
Go on.
Sure, Will seems nice.
And he puts together an okay party platter.
But I have got a ton of money.
And I can take you places you've never been before.
Don't you want that, Grace?
Don't you want to go to those places?
Wow.
That's hot.
Women.
Sexy.
Yum.
- What time is it?
- Oh, God, you are such a good kisser.
You kiss like a girl.
Well, I-- I throw like one too.
- Wait, wait, whoa.
Did you hear something?
- Mm-mm.
No, I--I thought I heard Grace at the door.
Grace, is that you?
D-don't come in here.
Don't you and Deirdre come in here right now!
Deirdre, stop.
You're--you're making me all confused.
- Then I'll make it simple.
Say yes.
Be on my team.
I want you on my team.
- Stop saying "team".
Look, look Will is my partner.
I am committed to him.
You have to respect that.
Please.
Okay.
I understand.
I completely understand.
- Thank you.
- Would you like to dance?
- Okay.
Jack.
Jack, wake up!
Honey, wake up.
Wake up right now.
Wake up.
Jackie, Jackie.
What?
Karen!
I was right in the middle of a great dream.
Jude Law and I were taking a Jacuzzi.
And I was looking at the long arm of the Law.
Heh Honey, have you been asleep this whole time?
Except when I peed.
But I never got out of the bed.
Why?
Then it was him.
Honey, Stan spoke to me.
I was downstairs making a ham sandwich, and all of a sudden, I heard Stan's voice.
Oh, my God!
Did you put mayo on it?
Honey, I'm telling you, it was him.
Stan spoke to me!
- Well, you know, it makes sense.
- Really?
In Native American mythology, the refrigerator is the portal to dead fat people.
Oh, my God.
What did he say?
Is heaven fabulous?
Do they let gay people in?
No, wait, I wanna be surprised.
Honey, he said that I could marry Finny.
He said that all he's ever wanted was for me to be happy.
Well, I told you that Karen.
He'd want you two to be together.
Even when he was alive, he fantasized about you with other men.
Why should it be any different when he was dead?
Oh, Jackie.
This calls for champagne.
I'm so excited!
Now I can get married.
You know, I guess I just needed to hear it from the man himself.
Mm.
- How did that happen?
- I just do a better Stan than you.
Grace!
What the hell?
!
Give us a minute.
Excuse us.
What the hell-- what the hell is going on?
Wh-what about the plan?
I'm in there vamping for 20 minutes.
I'm supposedly out here now looking for condoms!
I'm thinking about becoming partners with Deirdre.
She thinks I'm pretty.
What?
!
Don't you see what she's doing?
She's trying to break us up.
She's a puma!
She is.
And I'm the weak one!
I'm the limpy gazelle.
How dare you.
How dare you use sex as a weapon to prey on this innocent girl?
Will?
Did you find any rubbers?
I'm with him now.
Don't be a simp.
He's using you.
Just like I'm using her.
- What?
!
- What?
!
- Is that true?
!
- Is that true?
!
- Kinda.
- Kinda.
- You were using me?
- You were using me?
- Oh, come on!
You were all over me.
- And you were all over me.
- Is that true?
!
- Is that true?
!
- Kinda.
- Kinda.
- You bitch!
- You bitch!
- You bitch!
- You bitch!
W-w-w-wait!
Is this what we've been reduced to?
Cheap sexual ploys?
Over what?
Real estate?
I'm ashamed of all of us.
You're really not into me at all?
I'm not big on the redheads.
Can I look at it later?
I think twice was enough.
Look, we don't want any more trouble.
W-we-- W-w-well, you guys take the East Side, and we'll just stay on the West Side.
Fine.
I'm tired of dressing to intimidate anyway.
I can't wait 'til being lesbian goes out of style again.
I can go back to my sweats and loose neckties.
So, you're not mad at me?
Are we still a team?
Of course, darling.
You know I love being a team with you.
What is it with them and the word "team"?
Besides, I don't blame you.
He's beautiful.
He's like a female k.d. lang.
- Are you mad at me?
- Yes, I'm furious.
- Oh, what else is new?
- Well, thanks for having us over.
- Yeah, let's make it a weekly thing.
- Remember, I don't want to see you anywhere near the East Side.
- Yeah!
- I don't like you butch.
That was fun.
I kind of liked being a lesbian.
Yeah, me too.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, you wanna be my second choice for the movies?
We can go to a family film and look for gay subtext.
Nah.
I'm just gonna hang around here get out the old tool box and do some fix-it work around the house.
Oh, if you're going to give yourself a pedicure, you have to get more cotton balls, 'cause I took 'em all.
Damn it!
How many times have I told you to stay out of my tool box?
Come on, Will.
I don't wanna go to the movies alone, like an overweight woman.
Well, ask Grace to go.
Grace?
It'd be kinda weird.
I mean, we hardly even know each other.
Why, you have things in common.
Like your love of the new format of Star magazine and-and not knowing who's running for president.
I don't really like voting.
What's the point of stepping into a booth if you can't get fondled?
Hi, gays!
Listen, Will, I need you to drive me around for the rest of the day.
Driver's getting his ears pinned.
I couldn't stand lookin' at those Dumbo flaps for one more second.
Karen, I'm not your chauffeur.
In fact, I think we discussed this when I came back from Bali with a tan, and you told me to bring the car around.
Kare, why don't you just drive yourself?
Uh Sweetheart, heh, I don't know what century you're living in, but women aren't allowed to drive.
Karen, you don't know how to drive, do you?
Nah, never had to.
Plus somebody's gotta be the designated drinker.
But, hey, since you work for the DMV, maybe you could teach me.
No, no, no, no.
Get Finster to do it.
No, he's British.
He'll teach me to drive on the wrong side of the road.
Isn't that where you're gonna end up anyway?
Well, get Jack to do it.
Jack?
That dope?
That dope couldn't teach a monkey how to scratch his own ass.
It's true.
Good, good.
You're doin' very well.
Oh, honey, I love driving.
It's exhilarating.
Let's take her up!
-Come on.
- Karen, this isn't a flying car.
It is when you've smoked as much as I have.
Just concentrate on the road.
You're doing just fine.
But give it a little more gas.
- Okay, now heads up.
Next block there's a woman with a baby carriage.
- I'm on it!
No, no!
Don't speed up!
Oh, damn, it's a cop.
- I'm on it!
- No, no, no!
You've gotta stop!
He's pulling us over.
Okay, listen, there's something you should know.
I was just a kid, 14 or so, and I fell in with the wrong crowd.
- One kid's father had a gun.
And I didn't want the others to think I was chicken, so we see this businessman really full of himself.
- Here he comes.
Reel it in.
Point is, I never did nothin'.
And you don't know nothin' about nothin'.
You got me?
- You know how fast you were going?
- How could I?
I'm inside it.
- Officer, is there a problem?
- License and registration, please.
Oh, sure.
No problem.
Meet license and registration.
We're sorry, officer.
We won't do it again.
You should've seen what she showed customs when they asked for her passport.
Oh, hey, buddy, I'm sorry, but this seat's taken.
By my feet.
How happy are you that I snuck in Chinese?
Happier than a gay teen with new ice skates.
Hello, that's a little gross to be eating smelly food in a movie theater.
Will an egg roll shut you up?
It will.
Okay, um, I promised Stuart, I'd see this movie with him.
So don't tell him we saw it.
When he found out I saw Calendar Girls first, he went ber-serk.
He didn't talk to me for the whole shower.
Hey, isn't that him?
Um-mm, nope.
Couldn't be.
Stuart's working.
You just think it's him because when you're in love with someone, you imagine you see them everywhere.
- But I'm not in love with Stuart.
- Yet you see him everywhere!
You know, it stinks like Chinese food in here.
That sounds just like Stuart's laugh.
It's so annoying when he does it in bed.
- Why does he laugh in bed?
- Mind your own beeswax.
I'm gonna check it out.
- Oh, my God, that is Stuart!
- Who's the guy with him?
- Guy?
!
Oh, my God, there is a guy.
How dare he!
Okay, okay, calm down.
So he lied about having to work.
So he's seeing the movie he promised to see with you.
So he's here with a hot, young guy Do we have a point?
You know, you'd think I would.
I'm gonna go confront him.
I'd slap him silly if it didn't make him laugh in bed.
No, no, just-- Come on.
Sit down.
You're too upset.
We always regret the things we do in the heat of anger.
Besides, I need someone to hold my mu shu pancake.
Listen, officer, I realize she was going a little over the speed limit-- And that's a ticket you're writing.
Well, it isn't a poem about springtime in Cincinnati.
Why Cincinnati?
First town I thought of.
Actually, the second.
But nobody would write a poem about Newark.
Nothing rhymes with it.
- What rhymes with Cincinnati?
- Just take the ticket.
- Have a nice day.
- You too.
- Jerk.
- What was that?
- I said bye!
Bye.
See ya.
Oh, my gosh.
That is the single scariest thing that has ever happened to me.
And I've seen Rosario at the beach.
God, I can't believe this.
Like cops don't have anything better to do.
How 'bout stopping crimes?
You know, how 'bout getting unlicensed guns off the street?
Or off your lap?
!
Has that been there the whole time?
Oh, come on.
Don't get all down on yourself 'cause you're gay.
Let's just pay it.
Yeah, I guess you're-- Whoa-ho!
Hang on.
I think I spy a loophole.
Oh, honey, is my passport showing?
No.
It looks like he forgot to sign the ticket, which means it's invalid.
We are so gonna fight this in traffic court.
Whoa!
Watch out for that nun.
- I'm on it!
- No!
Don't speed up!
Did you see that?
That guy just whispered something to Stuart.
I didn't trim hair out of that ear so some young hottie could whisper sweet nothings in it without getting hair in his mouth.
I can't take it!
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Wait.
Before you do anything, count to ten.
- Why?
- 'Cause Will said you couldn't.
Excuse me, Theater 14, I know you think you've come to watch a movie.
But you are about to witness a scene.
- Jack, what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
- Shh!
- Grace!
Do not shush me during my inappropriate outburst!
Ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a situation similar to the one Drew Barrymore is going through on the screen.
Although, unlike her, I am not overacting.
- Look, Jack-- - I don't want to hear it!
You're a liar and a cheat.
And if we had the same right to marry in this country, you'd be an adulterer too.
I hate you, and I never want to see you again!
Good-bye.
And thank you for coming to Loew's.
Sit back and relax.
Enjoy the show.
Hey.
We're up next, okay?
So, so let me do the talking.
Don't do anything disruptive.
Give me the booze.
- Oh.
- And the pills.
- Aw!
And the pills.
And the pills.
And the whoopee cushion.
Will, if you take my whoopee cushion, how am I supposed to do my Inherit the Wind gag?
For the last time, no Inherit the Wind gag, and no telling the judge to keep it in his robe.
Boy, I cannot wait to humiliate that smug cop in that courtroom.
Just rub his nose in his mistake and laugh as he walks out of there with his tail between his legs.
Hi, Angry.
Mad much?
Listen, I'm gonna hit the vending machines.
I've been jonesin' for a Score bar all day.
- Well, hello there.
- You smilin' at me?
I'm not smiling.
I'm smirking.
You're probably wondering what I'm smirking at.
Not really.
I'm smirking because, boy, have you got a surprise comin'.
- Probably wondering what that surprise is.
- Not really.
I'll give you a clue.
You're a conductor.
You're shakin' a snow globe.
All right, no wait.
You're a-- You've had a hand transplant.
Your body rejected the hand.
And now your hand is trying to get away by hailing a cab.
- Wrong!
You stink at charades.
- No, you stink at charades!
Hey, buddy, didn't sign the ticket.
Crap!
I always do that.
I also forget to sign my checks.
My therapist says it's because I'm not showin' up for myself.
Oh, man, they're gonna stick me behind a desk now.
Well, NYPD boo-hoo.
Maybe can pull or a paper clip.
And-and give him a ticket for, uh, for clipping together-- I don't know how to finish that.
The point is you're screwed.
Oh, yeah?
Well, your fancy suit doesn't hide the fact that you still stink at charades.
My baby don't mess around 'cause he loves me so and this I know for sure.
Hey ya.
Hey ya-- Hello?
I'm sorry, I'll stop.
Will you hang on a second?
I've got another call.
Hello?
Yes, I'll stop.
That's it.
I'm done with men.
I'm into women now.
Come on, let's make hot hetero love together.
Take off your breasts and turn around.
Oh, if only that was the first time a guy said that to me.
You know, at some point, you are going to have to talk to Stuart.
- Grace, you don't understand-- - No!
You don't understand!
- What?
- I just needed to get your attention.
Can you get me some milk out of the fridge?
These cookies are a little-- without it.
I'm sorry, you were saying?
You don't understand, Grace.
He lied to me.
And honesty's kind of, like, a big deal to me.
It's kinda what I'm known for.
Well, that and this There you are.
Why haven't you returned my calls?
I left messages for you in a cute voice.
I rewrote the lyrics to Carousel to reflect our situation.
I cried.
I've done everything a man is supposed to do.
Oh.
Stuart.
I hardly recognized you without the 12 rows of theater seats behind you and another man at your side.
- Jack, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me-- - No, You listen to me!
- What?
- Can you put this back?
I think I'm done now.
You know, you haven't given me a chance to explain.
Oh, really?
All right.
Well, let's hear it.
What's your explanation for lying to me and telling me you were working, when really you were out at a movie with a hot guy?
He's my son.
Oh, my God.
That is exactly what happened today on Passions.
Was he raised by pirates?
Because that would just be a really weird coincidence.
You know what?
Maybe Will was right.
Maybe you can't count to ten.
How do you have a son?
Well, like, like many young people, when I was in college, I experimented with heterosexuality.
Mindy and I shared a bathroom for two semesters, and now we share a son for the rest of our lives.
I'da told you sooner, but I didn't know how you'd react.
I just think it's weird you didn't tell me you had a son.
It makes me doubt us.
- Jack, have you told Stuart you have a son?
- No, but that's different.
I forgot I had one.
- You have a son?
- Yeah.
His name's Elliot.
When he was 17, he donated some sperm because he wanted to buy a leather coat.
We used to call it his member-only jacket.
But, you know, now that there's an actual life involved, we just call it a jacket.
Good God, do you ever stop eating?
Well, I guess there's still a lot that we don't know about each other.
Yeah, I guess so.
Like, you should probably know that I tell people I like pistachios, but I don't.
- So we're okay, right?
- I guess so.
- All right.
- Aww, gay love.
I miss it.
- I'd love to meet your son sometime.
- Oh, I'd love to meet yours.
- My what?
At which point, I noticed the defendant speeding by.
I clocked her doing 42 in a 25 zone.
So I pulled her over and issued a citation.
Thank you, officer.
I-I also found a voodoo doll of Marlo Thomas in the trunk.
It was spooky, Your Honor, but I don't think it broke any laws.
Your Honor, I would like to cross-examine the witness, if I may.
Uh, this is traffic court.
I'm aware of that, seeing as Your Honor is eating a sandwich.
However, if you'll indulge me-- For the record, my name is Will Truman.
I'm the attorney for the defense.
Wait-- You're Will Truman?
- Yes, and I'll ask the questions here.
- No, it's just-- I'm Vince.
I'm friends with Joe and Larry.
- You're Vince, friends with Joe and Larry?
- Yeah, they've been tryin' to fix us up for years.
Wh--?
!
You're kidding!
You're--you're--you're the Vince that rides a motorcycle and makes his own lotions?
That's me.
And you must be the Will that makes an olive tapenade that would make you faint.
I don't know about faint, but you may want to be in a room full of pillows just in case.
Uh, Mr. Truman.
This isn't happy hour at the Manhole.
It's a court of law.
Oh, please, eat your sandwich.
I can't believe we're meeting like this.
I know.
This is so weird.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
This isn't happy hour at the Cockpit.
This is a court of law.
Now get your ass out there and litigate, bitch!
Uh, Your Honor, we don't dispute the officer's version of the events.
However, there is a single piece of evidence-- - Just one minute.
- It's fine, I've got pudding.
Karen, I have a problem.
This is the first cute, available guy I've met in a long time.
And there's a very good possibility that he's into me.
Can we please drop this ticket?
A possibility?
You wanna sell me out for a possibility?
Listen, mister, if we're gonna throw this case, it's gonna be for a sure thing.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Robe.
Permission to approach the hot cop.
Sure.
Listen, I have got one question for you, and you had better consider your answer very carefully.
My attorney is horny as hell.
I know he's not much to look at, but he's horny as hell.
Now, if we drop this whole thing, would you go out on a date with him?
- Sure.
- Remember, you're under oath.
Yeah.
I like his hair.
- Well, Your Honor, we're all done here.
- Me too.
- So, I'll see you Friday night.
- Great.
And just so you know, I'm usually a better lawyer than this.
Sure.
And look, I-I don't want you think because I didn't sign your ticket, that I'm some kind of flake.
I really am a very good cop.
Jeez, where's my gun?
I must have left it in the the john.
I'm in so much trouble.
Truman shoots.
Truman scores.
Hee hee.
I haven't felt this good about myself in a long time.
Uh-oh, did someone just Inherit The Wind?
Odor in the court!
Odor in the court!
My baby don't mess around because he loves me so and this I know for sure.
Hey ya-- Hey, wait a minute.
Will didn't teach me how to brake.
Car, stop.
Car, stop!
Oh, well.
Something'll stop me.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hi.
Is Will back from his date with that cop guy?
No, still out.
He is?
I figured by now he be curled up in his bed crying himself into a Snickers bar.
Why do you do that, Jack?
You're his friend.
Why does Will's pain always amuse you?
'Member that time his date went so badly, he came home and started writing a play?
Ah!
You mean, If Gay Means Happy, Why Am I So Sad?
Yes, that-- Well, this is the first time I've had a police escort to my door.
Well, second.
I was dressed as a prostitute for Halloween.
There was a bit of a mix-up.
I have a hard time too on Halloween in the Village.
People never believe I'm a cop.
They're always asking me where the Indian and the construction worker.
- Okay, let me see.
- No.
No.
Get off.
- You get off.
- Get-- Hi!
Oh, hi!
What are you doing?
We were just, uh, looking for a new spot in the apartment to hang out.
- Jack, what do you think about right here?
- This looks great.
Looks like a keeper.
This works.
Who are you calling?
Vince.
Even though I'm gonna see him in the morning for coffee, I just thought it might be nice to leave him a message telling him how much I like him and how I can't wait to see him again.
It's what I do after a first date.
It's kinda my thing.
Yeah, you know what else is kinda your thang?
Not having a second date.
Put the phone down.
Well, isn't it rude not to leave a five minute message Including a top ten list of the night's best moments?
For someone who is so smart in life, you are so dumb in love.
Why?
What are you talking about?
Will, you're too needy.
It's a turnoff.
The whole town's talkin' about it.
Well, I'm talkin' about it.
The whole town's listening.
I like him.
What's wrong with telling him I like him?
There's nothing wrong with-- It's just-- Okay, look.
Let me come at it from a-- from a different angle here.
Um, okay.
Okay.
What quality do you find most attractive in a man?
- When he ignores me?
- Exactly.
Let someone chase you.
Let someone call you.
Let someone do for you.
But I don't want to play those games.
My god, I mean, I'm in my early thirties.
Darling You, like your waist size, are not in your early thirties anymore.
Try playing it cool for once.
Men don't like to be chased.
They like to do the chasing.
But we're both men.
We're in an ugly area.
Let's move on.
Oh, honey, where have you been?
I've been waiting here at the water cooler for us to have our water cooler chat.
So did you start talking about "Sex and the City" yet?
We just started.
Oh.
Honey, I am so glad that Carrie ended up with Big instead of that 70-year-old ballerina.
I know.
And when she walked into that coffee shop at the end and the other girl started screaming, I'm not ashamed to say I was crying like a little girl.
Well, of course, I was piercing my ears too.
- Oh, honey, I'm gonna miss my "Sex and the City".
- Oh.
Me too, Karen.
But at least I've still got my "Frasier" and my "Friends".
Well, wait, didn't you hear?
"Frasier" and "Friends" are going off the air too.
Don't tell me that, Jackie!
Not now.
Not today.
Believe me, Karen, I know.
It's tragic.
I went through some of the biggest changes of my life with those shows.
Cargo pants came in, went out, came back in again.
I don't know whether they're in or out, but I bought 32 pairs of them with Will's money so I'm gonna wear 'em.
You wanna talk about changes?
I went through perhaps the most important milestone of my life: the tiny knapsack.
Oh, the tiny knapsack.
How could a knapsack so tiny hold all my dreams?
Oh, Jackie, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna talk about around this water cooler every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning?
I don't know, Karen.
I mean, you hear about when other people lose their shows, but you never think it's gonna happen to you.
It makes me sick to think how cruel I was to my own mother when "Barnaby Jones" got cancelled.
You know, when Stan died, I knew just what to do.
A few months later, I simply got engaged to someone else.
But this is different, Jackie.
This is television.
But, Karen, don't you see?
We just have to find a new show.
Something that combines the gay sensibility of "Sex and the City," the gay sensibility of "Frasier," and the gay sensibility of "Friends".
Honey, you mean like "Magnum, P.I."?
No, Karen.
That show got cancelled years ago.
You know, I never really had my heart set on being a cop.
I just knew I wanted to wear blue and ride around in a car with another guy all day.
Besides, with all four of my brothers being cops-- Wow, five brothers, all cops?
I think I have that video.
You hear that laugh?
He digs me.
What's Grace talking about?
I don't have to be cool and aloof to get a guy to like me.
I can just be myself.
In fact, this is the perfect time to-- You know, there's this new bar I've been dying to check out.
The Third Street Grill.
It's the first gay bar in Manhattan that doesn't have a pun in its name.
Although lately, we've been referring to it as "The Third Street Girl".
Tomorrow night, you wanna go?
Ooh, I don't know.
I'm not sure what time I'm working till.
Well, why don't I just give you all my numbers?
That way you can call me when you're done.
I'm not really doing anything.
Just a night of soup and online Yahtzee.
- So, yes?
- Maybe.
Maybe's not a no.
Well, as the homicide detectives like to say, I'm gonna go window-shop the muffins.
You pathetic, needy, idiot!
Grace was right.
Why didn't I let him ask me out?
Ugh.
I've gotta remember to buy Bounce.
Buy Bounce.
Buy Bounce.
Wait, what was the other thing I was thinking about?
Oh, right.
Let him come to me.
Hey, is there a lot of fat in madeline's?
You know, those holsters can be so unforgiving.
What?
You know what, actually, I just--I just remembered I-I-I actually have plans for tomorrow night.
So forget about the bar.
Oh, really?
'Cause I was gonna see if I could maybe move some stuff around.
- Well, you know, why don't you, uh, why don't you check in with me late tomorrow, I'll see where I am.
- Okay.
Well done, Billy boy.
How come more people don't call me that?
Oh, right.
'Cause I'm 40.
All right.
This is it, Jackie.
The beginning of a new era.
We are going to let new fictitious characters into our lives.
Now, I think it's important to be fair to these new shows.
So let's give each one of them five seconds to grab our interest.
All right.
Bring on the shows.
- Nope.
- Nope.
Fat guy, skinny wife.
Fat guy, skinny wife.
Fat guy, skinny wife.
Ugly guy, skinny wife?
America is not ready for that.
Ugh.
The stock dumb character.
When are they gonna stop insulting our intelligence with these morons?
Jackie, you accidentally turned it off.
You're looking at your reflection.
Oh.
Okay, now this is like a pastiche of five other shows like something written by a committee.
They're trying to please everybody, but ironically have ended up pleasing nobody.
It's hopeless, Jackie.
TV is over!
You're right.
There's never gonna be shows like that again.
There's never gonna be a funky barka lounger in an immaculate Seattle living room with two brothers, one fussier than the next.
Or six friends living together.
Could a show be any funnier?
Or four women sitting around drinking cosmos talking about penises and penis-hers.
Jackie, I think you're forgetting about the fifth woman, a lady I like to call Manhattan.
So what are we gonna do, Karen?
I guess we'll just have to find something else to talk about.
Hey.
You know, we could go out and have life experiences of our own, then get together later and discuss them.
You know, like the people on TV do.
Right.
That's good, Karen.
I'll meet you at Central Perk in an hour.
- Jack, that place is fictitious.
- Okay, two hours.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
I was about to give up on you.
You said you were gonna be here an hour ago.
Well, I say a lot of things.
Only mean about half of them.
Gimlet me.
Double time.
Apology accepted.
Hey, David.
- You know that guy?
- We had a thing once.
Really?
'Cause he keeps pointing to himself and mouthing, "I'm not David".
FYI, guys whose names I can't remember, I call "David".
- You wanna dance?
- Whoa, whoa, slow down.
I just walked in.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, call me, you monster!
- Let me guess.
David.
- I'm so--I didn't know there would be so many of my exes here tonight.
- Listen, are you feelin' okay?
'Cause you seem a little-- - What?
Cool, aloof, not needy?
Might be.
I hope that works for ya.
Right.
Look, I'm gonna hit the john and maybe bust these two guys for sellin' ecstasy.
'Scuse me.
Hey, he's a nice guy.
Why are you being such an ass to him?
I'm not being an ass to him, okay?
I'm playing it cool.
Guys like that.
Really?
Then why is he dancing with that guy that looks like Gwyneth Paltrow?
Huh?
!
I tell you, men are such bitches.
Why do I work here?
!
- Hello?
- Grace, look.
I followed your advice, and now Vince is on the dance floor with another guy.
Okay, listen.
Just play it cool, okay?
This is how gay men operate.
The two of you are locked in a high stakes, erotic, pied-a-terre.
- Pas de deux.
- That's what I said.
You said "pied-a-terre".
That's an apartment.
I know.
I took Spanish for two semesters.
Just keep ignoring him.
It'll work.
I promise you.
Before I do that, is there any chance that your advice could be wrong?
Chance?
Of course.
Good chance.
Just look at my love life before I met Leo.
Look at my love life after I met Leo.
Really, when I give you advice, I'm just talking out of my ass.
I can't believe I ever listen to you!
Never again!
Okay, what do I do now?
Well, it's a puzzle.
I mean, clearly, he's a guy who hates guys who play games.
Like the games you told me to play.
Yeah.
He hates that.
So, I think the best chance you have right now is to just completely put yourself out there.
Just totally show him how you feel, like some huge, exposed, raw nerve just covered in need.
In other words, what I was gonna do to begin with.
Like I said, outta my ass.
Oh, boy, Kare, that was great.
Who needs TV when you can have life experiences like that?
- Right!
- Okay, my turn.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So I went to a delicatessen-- A delica what?
A delicatessen.
And after I placed my order, I had realized I had forgotten to say, "All white meat turkey".
Uh-oh.
So I went back to the guy, and I said, "Could you make that all white meat turkey, please"?
And you know what he said?
No, but I bet it's gonna tickle and inform me.
He said, he said, "Sure".
That's it?
That's your life experience?
It's a lot better than yours.
"Rosario's brother is a political prisoner".
Boring.
Yours was boring!
At least mine was topical.
Mine had two characters and a twist.
- What was the twist?
- He said "Sure"!
Jackie, let's face it.
Without our shows, we're nothin'.
- I know.
It's so sad.
Never be happy again.
- No.
'Scuse me, did I leave a cell phone here?
LILITH!
!
We love you, Lilith!
That's great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's Bebe.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
God, love you, Lilith, you're so dry.
Your unemotional monotone provides a needed balance for Frasier's neurotic histrionics.
Plus, you've got the body of a 14-year-old Korean gymnast.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Well, it's always nice to meet fans.
Especially in a public place with lots of witnesses and clearly marked exits.
- Lilith, come sit down.
- Sit down.
Sit, sit.
- So, Lilith - Bebe.
- Oh, my god.
- So, Lilith, now, we've stood by your show for 10 years.
Frasier's been on the air for 11.
We didn't care for season eight.
How could you end it like this?
How could you just walk out on us without an explanation?
Okay, you two really need to let go.
- But we can't!
- No, I mean, let go.
You're hurting me.
God, ow.
Look, just move on, okay?
I have.
There's more to me than Lilith.
We've never seen it.
Come on.
Talk like Lilith, we hate your real voice.
Well, I will if you will.
Look, you guys, you guys are freaks, man.
I'm not Lilith, I'm Bebe.
I'm an actress.
I sing.
I'm a Broadway dancer.
Look at these pins.
You know any 40-year-olds who can wrap their legs around their necks?
Look, these babies worked for me before "Frasier," they're gonna work for me afterwards.
So don't you worry about Lilith.
- You mean Bebe.
- No, I mean Lilith.
I want to play that bitch forever.
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.
What about your pins?
Oh, screw my pins.
"Frasier" is such an easy gig, man.
They fly you first class to Los Angeles, put you up in the Bel Air Hotel, per diem.
I deliver several lines in a robotic monotone and I'm buyin' a new Lexus.
- Oh, my God, Lilith's back!
- Lilith's back!
Yay!
- Hey, you looked really good out there dancing with that other guy.
- Thanks.
See you around.
Vince, wait.
Officer, arrest me for being an idiot.
I feel awful.
I made a horrible mistake.
That guy that I was before, that's not me.
I was just-- I was just playing a game.
Will, I don't play games.
Look, I'm a romantic.
Call me old-fashioned, but I believe when a guy takes another guy out, he should treat him like a lady.
I believe that too.
Look, I really liked you, so I didn't want to scare you away by showing you what a desperate mess I really am.
You know, that's-- That's why I didn't call you after our first date or send flowers to the precinct or ask to see your driver's license photo so I could sneak a peak at your birthday and write it in my Palm Pilot with a reminder for the week before: Buy Vince present, smiley face.
I don't like when you call yourself a mess.
You should learn to love yourself, Will.
And then love will come to you.
I know that sounds simple, but it took me six years of therapy and a bullet to the neck to figure that out.
Wow.
You're a bigger mess than I am.
You say mess, I say work in progress.
Look, uh, what do you say we get outta here?
You know, maybe get a cup of coffee?
April 3rd.
Oh.
Okay.
Was kinda hoping now.
Me too.
April 3rd is my birthday.
- You know, for your Palm Pilot.
- Oh, oh!
I was just-- I was just kidding about that.
I'm not such a big geek that I'd actually-- Oh, who the hell am I kidding?
April 3rd, did you say?
While I have you here, what is your hat size?
Come on, let's get outta here.
Oh, hey, on the way home, do you mind if we stop?
I gotta buy Bounce.
Hey, Jackie, did we get a little nutty?
Thinking that some made-up character could help us?
Maybe a little?
But it doesn't matter.
We don't have to resolve this till the same time next week.
I just wish we had something to remember her by.
Oh.
I got her wallet.
Honey, I couldn't resist.
She had the tiny knapsack.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
You look handsome.
Thank you.
April fool's.
You got me.
You are so clever.
-Thank you.
-April fool's.
You know, I love this holiday.
You don't have to buy presents or nothin'.
Actually, I bought you a present.
I bought you one too.
-April fool's!
-April fool's!
So, why are you so happy and light today?
Your anger lines are positively beaming.
I went out with Vince last night.
We went to see the revival "Fiddler on the Roof".
And we shared a box of Fiddle Faddle.
And so I said, "Hey, it's too bad we're not eating this on the roof, 'cause then it would be "Fiddle Faddle on the Roof".
Please keep that to yourself.
The religious right already hates us enough.
So, what does Grace think?
Oh, they haven't met yet.
They haven't met?
How do you know if you like him?
Are you implying that I would need Grace's approval to know whether or not I like somebody?
Do you really think that our friendship is that sick and co-dependent that even as I'm saying this, I'm realizing it's true.
You should do it.
You should get them together, see what she thinks.
Pay now or pay later.
You're right.
They should meet.
Remember that one guy, Ted?
We went out for a few months.
We even talked about moving in together.
All she had to say was "Mock turtleneck," and it was over.
Hey, Wilma.
Okay, Jackie, I'm ready for my dance lesson.
Whoo.
I haven't been out on the dance floor since Studio 54.
' Course I'll be a lot more relaxed this time knowing Liza's not in the coat room poking through my stash.
Karen needs to learn the Fox Trot so she doesn't embarrass herself at her wedding.
Oh, there'll be plenty of time for that when she passes out in the wedding cake.
Say, Wilma, I saw you and your new boyfriend last night at the theater.
Yeah, between the Jews on stage and the homos in the audience, it was like payin' 100 bucks to hang out here.
So Has Grace met your new fella yet?
Not yet.
hen how do you know if you like him?
Welcome to the dance!
Fact.
Before language, people communicated through intricate choreography, costume changes, and lighting.
Language was only invented when unattractive people were born and needed to be commented on.
Any thoughts, questions-- Can we skip ahead a few thousand years?
I have to learn to Fox Trot!
Lyle is an expert, and I have to keep up with him.
The man was in the British military for five years.
You don't get better dance training than that.
Don't I know it.
My grandfather was one of the first ballerinas to land on the beach at Normandy.
Fact: D-Day stands for Dance Day!
Now Let's start with a simple box step.
It is called that because we lead with our box.
Well, if I can fake happiness with I can certainly dance with it.
And one, and two, and -- to the side -- three -- good -- and four.
Once again.
And one -- very good -- and two, and three, and, um -Four.
-Yes, four.
Right, and spin.
Very good.
Yeah, very good.
One Jack This is so much fun.
I can't wait to try this with a man.
But I am a man.
Yes, you are.
Okay, well that was very good.
You got the basics down.
Let's move on.
Let's try a little somethin' new.
Check this out.
Ready for this?
And kick it, and kick it.
And kick it, and kick it.
Very good, very nice.
Now, let's get a little dirty.
Let's move in, we're getting dirty.
And Swayze, and Swayze, nice.
And Havana Nice.
Now kiss me!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
-I'm supposed to be learning the Fox Trot.
-Sorry And one-- Ah, Jackie I'm gonna miss these times with you.
What do you mean you're gonna miss them?
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Yeah, but I am.
Once Finny and I are married, we're not gonna be able to play like this.
Of course we are.
Stan and you were married, and we still saw each other every day and night.
Except for that one night a month that you take Rosario out to get drunk and pee off the pier.
I know, Jackie.
But this is different.
Stan was fat.
Finster is thin.
We're gonna be able to do a lot more things together.
You know, like sit on the same bench at the same time.
And see around each other.
Oh So.
Our friendship, as we know it, is over.
But you knew that, right?
Yeah, that's gonna be fun.
Why did I make something I've never made before?
I can't tell if this ginger chicken is done right.
Needs another half-teaspoon of saffron.
Oh, and the three pieces on the right need to be flipped.
God, your nose is uncanny.
I can only imagine how powerful it was before you had it fixed.
I did not have a nose job.
Would I pick this?
Well, you did all the way through breakfast.
I want you to give Vince a chance.
I really like him.
How do you know?
I haven't met him yet.
Just don't be judgmental, okay?
Don't single out some aspect of him and then make a thing of it.
-Oh, my God, does he have white stuff in the corners of his mouth?
-No.
-Gay face?
-No.
Mock turtle.
-Just be open-minded.
-I'm always open-minded.
As long as he doesn't have a big mole on his cheek.
Like I do?
You should answer the door.
Vince.
And look, you brought presents.
Grace, he brought presents.
You told me to.
And he's a good listener.
Vince, Grace.
Grace, Vince.
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.
I, uh, I brought you a DVD player.
We busted some guys sellin' 'em out of their car.
Thanks.
I hear you guys get the best pot too.
-You do drugs?
-No.
Hey, we're all gettin' along.
Vince, did you bring the, uh, the article?
-Uh, no.
What?
It's silly.
-It's not silly!
You're a celebrity.
What article?
I'm not a celebrity, Will.
I'm just havin' my 15 minutes.
-What'd you do?
-Can I tell her?
If you have to.
Vince got everybody on the force to start using moisturizer on their hands.
I make lotions.
And now they're known as the precinct with the softest hands in town, yeah.
Well, one perp even said it was like being-- being frisked by a kitten.
he secret is Shea butter.
You can't use too much or else the gun goes slidin' outta your hands.
Learned that one the hard way.
Oh, my God, you haven't even been offered a drink.
How rude.
I'm so sorry.
Will, two wine's.
So, uh, I hear you and your husband live in Brooklyn.
I live on Henry Street.
I only know my street.
-Here we go.
-Oh.
Is that the famous olive tapenade?
Oh, please, it's not famous.
It can--it can still go to the mall and no one even tries to stop it.
You said you wanted to try it.
That's so sweet of you to remember.
Well, it was nice of you to bring us stolen electronics.
What's in this?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
I know that's a joke, but could you not say that, since I got shot at like two hours ago.
I know!
I had a day too.
Grace, you want some?
actually, you know, I-- I don't think I can stay for dinner.
What?
Uh, yeah.
I just--I just remembered that I have a meeting in the morning, and I forgot-- my sample books in-- in Brooklyn.
-Um, so-- I'll see you tomorrow.
It was so nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet you Oh, wow, really, really soft.
Wait, wait, wait.
What just happened?
Why are you leaving?
What--do you not like him?
No, he's nice.
You two are wonderful together.
I just gotta-- I-I-I gotta go.
Will, I gotta take back Grace's DVD player.
It's actually four kilos of cocaine.
Oh, Jackie, look at me, I'm Fox Trotting!
Hardly.
What am I doing wrong?
Look.
Some people were born to dance.
You were born to drink.
f you could cut a rug like you lift a mug, I'd have something to work with.
Honey, why are you being like this?
Because, just like our friendship, this dance lesson, as we know it, is over.
That's what you're upset about?
-I understand you love Finny, but why do things have to change between us?
-Because they have to.
Every healthy relationship between a gay man and a straight woman has a sell-by date.
Do you really want to end up like Will and Grace?
No.
So then I read the book by the redhead.
You know, the one from "Taxi".
She's all about food combining.
But she lets you cheat on weekends.
She's like, if you want it, have it.
ill, what's goin' on?
It's an interesting story.
I'm sorry, it's just-- There is no way that Grace would walk out on a free meal just to prepare for some business meeting.
This is a girl who missed her SAT's to wait for the warm donuts at Winchell's.
What's the problem?
I mean, I thought it went great.
I-I liked her.
She liked me.
Yes.
What--did she say somethin'?
What did she say?
She said you were "nice".
"Nice".
Nice is a bunny.
-What else?
-That's it.
That's it?
-Nothin' about my hair?
-Not a word!
What could she possibly have hated about you?
You didn't use the word "panties," did you?
'Cause she hates that word.
Will, I just met the girl.
Why would I use the word "panties"?
Oh There's gotta be something.
And it's so weird because I really thought I liked you.
Will, are you really the kinda guy who lets his best friend tell him who he can and can't date because of something as insignificant as hair or panties?
Yeah, I kinda am.
-What's this?
-If you're here for the audition, you have to sign in.
And have a naked body shot of your brother.
Audition?
You must be poor.
Oh.
Hey, Kare, what's up?
Well, Finny is insisting that we do the chicken dance now in addition to the Fox Trot.
Can you teach me?
Ah, yes, the chicken dance.
erhaps the most subtle of all dances.
-Give me a minute, I'm just finishing up with Phyllis.
-Who's Phyllis?
I'm holding auditions for your replacement.
Oh, honey, that's great.
I'm proud of you.
You're movin' on.
Yes.
America has narrowed it down to three finalists.
Meanwhile, my insults to the contestants have earned me quite a following.
Phyllis.
Oh, by the way, if you do get the job, we're gonna have to change that name.
Maybe Angie Dickenson.
Or Dickie Angenson.
I'll do whatever you want me to do, Jack.
I just-- I really want this job.
Oh, and by the way, how much does this pay?
I'm expecting to clear about $150,000 a year.
Plus airfare.
I noticed on your résumé that you've attended the Yale School of Drama.
Very, very impressive.
Yes, very good.
Spank it.
What?
Spank it.
-I have a boyfriend.
-Who doesn't?
Spank it.
Again.
Harder!
It's an ass, not a testicle!
Oh, my!
Very good.
Good.
You made it your own.
That's what we were lookin' for.
-Do you mean I get the job?
-Exactly!
You start immediately.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Don't you need to take a shower together to find out if you're compatible?
No, that was the first audition.
This is the call back.
Okay.
So, tonight, we'll go to our first gay bar and make fun of people whose stomachs are further out than their pecs.
-But Jackie?
What about my chicken dance?
-Sorry, we're a little busy, Kare.
Yeah, get lost, doll.
You've been recast.
Yeahof course, yeah, sure.
But, uh, before I go, Phyllis, could I ask you a question?
-Oh, yeah, sure.
What is it?
-Okay, come a little closer.
It's kind of a secret.
Heh heh Get the hell outta here!
I don't want you seeing her anymore!
What?
!
Why?
!
I can't stand the thought of you with another woman!
I know I said things have to change.
I know I said to move on, but, honey, just the thought of another woman spanking your fruity booty in a platonic fashion sickens me.
It sickens me!
That heinie's miney!
Now I'll make sure to always keep you in my life if you'll make sure to always keep me in yours.
Please?
Dickie Angenson?
I think you're very talented, and someday you'll make a gay gentleman a great date at the Oscars.
But, uh, well What are you saying?
You're fired.
Okay, look.
You obviously don't like Vince.
I understand.
I mean, sure his ears are a little too small for his head.
And sure, he smells a little vanilla-y And--and--and, sure, from a certain angle, he looks like a hot Jerry Seinfeld.
But I kinda hoped that you'd be willing to look past all that 'cause I like him.
In fact, I dig him mucho!
Will, I didn't notice any of those things.
Really?
How could you not?
I mean, look at the man.
Hi, it's me.
Tiny-eared, vanilla Seinfeld.
Wh-- You heard all that?
Yeah, the ears may be tiny, but they still work.
You really dig me mucho?
Sí.
Will, Vince is not why I left.
f I don't like one of your guys, I don't just walk out.
That's rude.
I drag you into the bathroom and tell you what's wrong with 'em.
Then, why did you leave?
Ugh.
I don't know, I just-- I was watching you two, and you guys looked so cute and happy and gay together.
And, you know, Leo and I used to be like that.
And he's coming home in a month and I don't I'm afraid that we're never gonna be like that again.
It's just a little scary.
So, this had nothing to do with Vince?
No.
I like him.
Love his hair.
I knew it.
Oh, sweetie.
I had no idea.
I feel so stupid.
I mean, we've been friends for 20 years.
I should have known you were thinking about yourself.
-Yeah, you should've.
-I know ut listen, you and Leo are gonna be fine.
You love each other.
And, yeah, it may take a little while to get back in sync, but you'll do it.
Or you won't and you'll split up.
Or they will, and they'll be happy together.
Or they won't.
Look, Vince.
Grace is fragile, okay.
She needs encouragement and, and, and lies.
No, Will, he's right.
It may not work out.
And, finally, someone has the guts to say it to me out loud.
-You know, truth is, if your marriage was so great, he wouldn't have left in the first place.
-Okay, too far, Vince.
OK.
Will, I'm ready more lies.
Everything will be fine.
Leo will come back.
He'll sweep you off your feet.
There'll be a constitutional amendment banning the mock turtleneck.
And everybody will live happily ever after.
God, I hope so.
Okay.
You two should get back to your date.
I will be fine.
Hey, Will, why don't we stay here?
Your friend's kinda down, and my house is right around here anyway.
You are so sweet to care about my friend.
Really, it's just two blocks away.
Then I guess you're stayin'.
Come sit down.
Sweetie, could-- could you and I switch so we could sit together?
I'm kind of already here.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Look at that.
Each pane cleaner than the last.
Mmm.
Yeah.
A boy and his rag.
There's nothin' sweeter.
Well, with Grace out of town for a couple of days, it gives me a chance to get her snout and paw prints off of every surface.
Besides, Tina's coming over.
She says she needs to see me.
Tina?
Your father's mistress?
Well, technically, she's not his mistress anymore.
I mean, now my folks have broken up, she's really just his girlfriend.
No, that's like saying if you were raised by wolves and then rescued by humans, you're now suddenly human.
But you are human.
Honey.
Don't leave me alone during the breakfast rush at Jacques'.
I'm workin' three stations out there, but, you've got a phone call.
Who is it?
- It's Elliot.
Your son.
- I'm not here.
Jack You have to talk to him.
That's the contract you made when you spent five minutes alone in the dark with a Dixie cup and a Men of General Hospital calendar.
No, no, he's gonna-- he's gonna try to get me to another one of his basketball games.
It's just not my thing.
Make up an excuse.
All right.
Um, Elliot Yeah, I've got some bad news.
Jack and I were figure skating and he plunged through the ice.
Haven't heard from him since.
Could I take a message?
Okay.
You're trying out for the cheerleading squad?
Brr, I'm back!
So, uh, Tina, what's goin' on?
Oh, it's your father.
I think he's seeing someone else.
And I don't know why.
I mean, look at me.
I'm fantastic.
What makes you think he's seeing someone?
Ohhe's just been distracted.
He's always sneaking off somewhere.
And latelyevery time we try to make love, he's tired.
And I'm sexual.
I need it.
I mean, I really, really need it.
Mm.
Yeah.
I really need not to know that.
- Will you talk to him?
Find out if it's true.
Please.
- Oh.
I have no one else to go to.
I'd go to my girlfriends, but I've slept with all their husbands.
Oh, that's great news.
Come on by after school.
I'd love to help you.
And P.S., Elliot, you've just made me the proudest father in the world.
Wow, cheerleading, huh?
Really following in his daddy's footsteps.
I remember when Stan's son first started getting fat.
Stan was so proud.
I only wish he'd lived to see him reach 300 pounds.
So Elliot queerleading tryouts, huh?
Cheerleading.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see what the kids are calling you when they're stuffing you in your locker on Monday.
Okay, Elliot.
So what are your guidelines?
I was thinking of making you all up in Kabuki like Madonna in her "Frozen" video.
Right, well I was thinking a simple cheer and dressed as a guy is probably a better way to go.
My locker's very small.
Why you ungrateful little piece of street trash!
I oughta-- We must encourage him no matter how deep the shame runs.
So it says here for the audition, you need to come up with your own cheer.
Okay, so why don't you show me what you got, and we'll just change it all to my stuff later.
Okay.
I'vegotschoolspirit.
I've gotschool spirit.
Why you talentless, tone deaf sack of-- You're not helping.
Sit.
I know it stinks.
That's why I'm here.
I need your help, Jack.
Okay, we can do this.
What are your ideas?
^What do you think this cheer should be?
I don't know.
They just said to come up with something good that shows enthusiasm.
Okay, good and enthusiastic.
Let's let that roll around.
And it's rolling around.
And it's rolling around.
Good and enthusiastic.
Not too on the nose.
And stop.
I've got it.
Boy, are we enthusiastic.
We are feelin' G-O-O-D.
Boy, are we enthusiastic.
We are feelin' G-O-O-D.
Good and be enthusiastic!
You see?
Yeah.
That--that's pretty good.
Thank you.
Now.
Let's add a little bit of this.
All right, ready?
When I say "go," you say "fight".
- Go.
- Fight.
- Go.
- Fight.
- When I say "when," you say "tonight".
When.
- Tonight.
- When.
- Tonight.
- Go-o-o team!
Go team!
- Okay, great!
Excellent!
I've never been more attracted to you than I am right now.
Dad, it's Will.
Can we talk for a sec?
Dad, I know you're home.
Look, I don't care that-- that you're with someone.
You're--you're single.
You can do what you want.
You're--you're Ben Affleck right now.
Only without all the extra breakup weight.
- So, look, whoever you're with in there, it's fine by me.
I just want to say that as far as-- - Hello, Will.
- Mom!
What's going on?
Where's Dad?
- He's in the shower.
In the sh-- You're the other woman?
!
You're the one that Dad's sneaking around with?
You and Dad are--are-- You know thinging.
Will, we're adults.
Let's talk like adults.
Your father and I are making pookie-pookie.
How did this happen?
I mean, like, I know how this happens.
You showed me when I was 10 with two of my G.I. Joes.
I'm not saying that that led to anything, I just How did this happen?
Well, a few months ago, I ran into your father, and we decided to have a drink.
Oh, it was fun.
- He made me laugh.
We caught up, and, you know, one thing led to another and before I knew it-- - You don't have to finish that.
Pookie-pookie.
Well, I guess in a way, this is good news.
You know, I mean, you and Dad are back together.
I'll only have to make one hand-print ashtray at Christmas-time.
There you go.
Who's pretty when he smiles?
I am.
- Hey.
- So?
How'd it go?
Wait, wait, wait.
Before you say anything, I'd like to present you with these pom poms.
They were your grandfather's.
Go, Elliot!
Go, Elliot!
- I didn't get it.
- What?
- Why you miserable, worthless-- - Karen!
What happened?
I stunk.
All the girls laughed at me.
I'm gonna graduate a virgin.
Wha--I don't understand.
Did you do this?
- Yes.
- What about this?
- Yes.
- Well, did you do this?
Yeah, I did all that stuff.
They just didn't like me.
Hey, did you do this?
Oooooh La la la la la ooooh whee-e-e ooooh.
Whoo!
No.
Well, you should try it.
It's fun.
You know, maybe I should go out for track.
Might as well.
Once word gets out I tried out for cheerleading, I'll be running a lot anyway.
Whoa-ho.
Whoa.
No.
Let me tell you something, Mister.
My family has had four generations of male cheerleaders.
And I ain't gonna do nothin' to break that up.
All right?
So I'm gonna go talk to the powers that be, and make sure they know we are a serious force to be reckoned with!
Karen!
My pom poms!
Boy, are we enthusiastic.
Grace, it's great.
My mom and dad are back together, you know?
And I-- I-I feel kinda bad for Tina, but then again, she is the one that kinda broke up the marriage, so I-- Are you peeing while I'm talking to you?
!
Yeah, I did one time, but at least I had the courtesy to-to-to do it silently around the edge of the bowl!
Look, I-- I gotta go.
Just, please, just this once for me, remember to wash your hands.
- Oh, hi.
Tina.
- Hello, Will.
- Come on in.
- Oh.
So um How have you been, Will?
- Not bad.
I, uh-- I kinda had a weird moment last night-- - Will!
I really don't care.
I just want to know what you found out.
Oh.
Um I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Then, why are you smiling?
Oh, that--that's just something that I do when I give bad news.
Um, people tell me it comforts them.
Oh How often do you give bad news?
Twice today, already.
Yeah.
A good friend of mine died.
So, um Listen I went to see my-- my Dad, and, uh yeah, yeah, he is seeing someone else.
I think it's serious.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Oh.
Okay.
You know this is what I thought.
Oh!
I'm so stupid.
When am I ever gonna find a married man who's faithful to me?
I don't suppose you found out who she is, did you?
I meanthe otherwoman.
- Does it really matter?
- Ah!
You're right.
She's probably some whore!
Or not.
One thing I do know is that he's-he's not gonna leave her.
So, you know, just move on.
Forget about him.
You know, you-- you got a killer body.
You love sex.
Who's not gonna snap that up?
Yeah, you're right.
To hell with him!
I-I deserve better than this.
You know, I was voted most confident in my low self-esteem support group.
- I hope he gets an STD from that whore!
- Or not.
Go, Wolverines, Go!
Go, Wolverines, Go!
Jack, I didn't make the squad.
Let it go.
No, I won't let it go.
If I learned anything from seeing Gypsy fifty times, it's to push your children to hate you and never want to speak to you again.
Now, which one's the head cheerleader?
The blonde.
Her name is Melanie.
And I kinda have a crush on her, so please don't embarrass me.
Don't worry.
Melanie!
- Yes, can I help you?
- I believe you can.
Yes.
How old is someone like you?
25?
Ever been in a limo?
I'm Elliot's father.
Okay?
That boy can cheer.
Okay?
He comes from a long, proud line of cheerleaders.
His great-grandfather came to this country with nothing but a tattered pom pom in his hand, and a dream that one day he'd see his children stacked in a perfect pyramid.
And now, you're telling me you're gonna deny my son his heritage?
Refuse him his birthright?
Well, yeah!
He sucked.
- See, Jack, I told you.
- Shush it!
- We are not leaving until you give him another chance.
- Come on, Elliot, we'll do it with you.
Hold my drink, Heather.
And I know how much is in it, so no sippies.
- Ready.
Okay.
- Hi, Cowboys.
Hi, Sailors.
- Hi, musclemen and cops.
Our team is called the Wolverines and you know our boys-- I can't do this!
I don't want to be a cheerleader.
I never wanted to be one!
School spirit!
What is going on?
What are you talking about?
The only reason I did this is so you would pay attention to me.
You don't care about anything I do.
You don't care about basketball, and you don't care about skateboarding.
We-we both like Vin Diesel movies.
Yes, for very different reasons.
Do you know how humiliating it was for me to try out for cheerleading?
But I was willing to do that to spend time with you.
I didn't know it meant that much to you, Elliot.
Why do you think I call you every Friday night to come to my basketball games?
You know what?
Forget it.
You can't understand.
No.
I do.
I do understand.
My dad did the same thing to me.
When I was a kid, I set up a little manicure stand at the end of my street.
I did a pretty good business with a couple neighbor ladies and the divorcees from the next town over.
But the only customer I ever really wanted was my dad.
Every day, I'd watch him come home from work, and I pray that he'd stop.
But he never did.
And I'd think to myself, "Why?
Why?
What kind of man doesn't want a roadside manicure from his own son"?
I can't believe I repeated that cycle with you.
- Well, you did.
- Well, I'm sorry, Elliot.
- I'd let you give me a manicure.
- You would?
- Yeah.
- You're the best.
Thanks, Elliot.
And I promise I'll start coming to your basketball games.
And I'll say to everyone, "That's my son, the one whose nails match his jersey"!
Yeah.
You don't need to say that to everyone.
- Will!
We have to talk.
- Mom!
What if I'd come out here wearing nothing?
You mean it's possible to wear less than you're wearing right now?
I'll have you know skirts are shorter this year.
What did you say to that woman?
- Nothing!
The-the truth.
I didn't mention you, but I-I did say that Dad's been seeing someone.
- Ah, Will, that's just perfect.
You've ruined everything.
Momlet's just sit down and talk about this.
- Uh-oh.
- Let's just stand up and talk about this.
Will, thanks to you, Tina's dumped him.
Well, that's great.
With Tina gone, you and dad can get back together, the way you used to be.
You know, with the-the joint showers and pookie-pookie.
Are you out of your head?
Don't you understand why he cheated on me in the first place?
Well, sure, because you stopped communicating.
The-the whole basis of your marriage started to slowly erode.
No.
It was fun.
Cheating is fun!
Ooh, the secret little meetings, and-and you only have an hour and then, you gotta hide the evidence.
Ooh, gosh, I felt like a spy.
- I felt like a sexual spy On a--on a mission to-- - You don't have to finish that.
- Seduce the enemy with my body.
- And she finished it.
Now, but thanks to you, the meddler in the mini-robe, that's all over.
Yeah, I just feel like we're married again, only now I have to pay for my own clothes.
- So what do you want me to do?
- Fix it!
No!
I-I-I I'm staying out of this.
You know, just-just- call one of your other sons.
Oh, your brothers can't help me.
They're straight.
They have no finesse for the-- for the details of manipulating petty dramas.
Gee, what a sweet way of voicing your support for your gay son.
Will-- Oh my God, you're nude!
Yeah, we've done all the robe jokes, move on.
I was packing my stuff at George's apartment, and I found a note.
The whore is your mother.
Meet my mother.
Whore, mistress.
Mistress, whore.
Well, um, hi, Marilyn.
We finally meet.
Though I've seen pictures of you when I removed them from your ex-husband's wallet.
Well, I must say, you're almost exactly as I imagined you.
You're like page four in the Midlife Crisis catalog.
Okay, ladies.
Let's relax and sit.
- Oh.
- Let's stand.
We have a very complicated problem here.
A lot of competing agendas.
But as a lawyer, I'm used to working on tricky corporate mergers.
So I'm sure we can find some common ground.
Mom, what is it you want?
Well, I want Tina to keep seeing George.
So he can sneak around with me behind her back.
You're quite the role model.
Tina?
Well, I want Marilyn out of the picture, so I can have George all to myself.
I mean, this is the first time I've ever dated a man that I didn't have to call, let it ring once, and call back.
So that was you at Thanksgiving?
So what we're looking for is a solution that encompasses all these needs.
Uh, Will, when you gesture like that, we can see your Pennsylvania.
However, that solution does not exist.
So let's get to what I want.
Otherwise known as what's gonna happen.
Tina, move on.
You're gonna be miserable at first, but you'll live.
Mom, you are gonna get back with Dad.
You're gonna be miserable at first, but you'll live.
- Are we clear on this?
- Um, yes.
I guess so.
Good.
Now we're all behaving like ladies.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna drink half a bottle of chardonnay, and scrub myself until I feel clean again.
- We're not gonna listen to him, are we?
- No, the three of us had a great thing going.
- So I'll take George Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
- And I'll keep him on the weekends.
We'll give him Tuesdays and Thursdays to rest.
Ohh, this is great!
And it's even more exciting now that we're lying to Will.
Ooh, and here's another.
This is your great-grandpappy, Liam McFarland, leading a cheer squad.
That's quite a split.
- And that was before stretch pants.
- Yeah, I can see that.
Oh, talk about courageous.
When the Yanks landed in Okinawa, he was right there alongside them, yelling, "Fight, fight".
And after the war, that brave man cheered with one arm.
How does that make you feel, boy?
If I say proud, can I go home?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Jack, wake up.
Jack?
-Oh, no, I think there's a tickle bug in the couch.
-Not a tickle bug!
Not a tickle bug!
Not a tickle bug!
What's going on?
Why am I in your apartment?
What did you do to me?
Oh, God.
Please tell me I put up at least a token show of resistance.
Relax, we all went out clubbing last night.
You had two light beers, got the hiccups, and made us carry you home.
All I remember is a strange man putting his hand down my khakis.
Yeah, that was you.
Oh, hi.
Wow, I can't remember the last time I was out that late.
I know.
It was wild.
I fell into bed without even flossing.
We're kind of like rock stars.
Well, morning boys.
I see we paired off last night.
Ooh-hooh.
That Grace is a tigress.
Girl sure knows how to put a smile in a lady's pants.
Karen, Grace passed out the minute she hit the pillow.
Nothing happened between you two.
Well That's not what it says on your bathroom wall.
Which reminds me, stop writing on my bathroom wall.
It took me three weeks to scrub off "I heart Mescaline".
Hey, now, I'm hearing a lot of words and none of them are "Jack".
Remember, this weekend's all about me.
I'm the one graduating from nursing school tomorrow.
You're right.
And we're very proud of you.
But I've been meaning to ask you, it's been five months.
How on Earth are you graduating already?
!
Oh, I had 16 credits from my vacation in Mexico.
Yeah, I clouded over the first few days, so I decided to take a few courses from the local medical school.
I don't know what they were, because I don't speak Spanish.
But, uh, they were handing those credits out like candy.
I think some of them even may have been candy.
Well, thanks for clearing that up.
And remind me the next time I have to go to the emergency room, we're going to Canada.
Well, poodle, I haven't forgotten that your graduation is tomorrow.
That's why I have planned a whole day of beauty for you.
They'll be manies and pedies, gentlemen's facials, and when you least expect it a colonic.
Oh, don't forget.
I have to make time to write my speech.
I was voted most popular, so I get to speak at the ceremony.
hat's some school you're graduating from.
Take credits from a Cancun vacation, most popular gives the speech.
Stay one more week, maybe you'll get your pilot's license.
Look, you guys.
Look it.
My name's even on the invitation.
See, "Commencement address by most popular student nurse, Jack McFarland".
That's me!
Uh, poodle, do you notice anything strange about this invitation?
Oh, my God, they spelled my name wrong!
No, they didn't.
Then what?
Well, it says the ceremony's on Saturday, not Sunday.
Today is Saturday.
Oh, my God, I must've read it wrong.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
God, I haven't seen him run like that since he wore Capezios in the Bronx.
Hurry up, Will!
I know it's a challenge.
You're probably not used to working with this much hair.
Yeah, well, we'd be a lot further ahead if you hadn't insisted we try the "Rachel" first.
Will, I tried to wake Grace, but she's sleeping like a log.
And there's ants on her, and she's lying in a shallow pool of water.
Forget about her.
We'll wake her later.
She only needs like three minutes anyway.
Two swipes of Right Guard and a stick of Trident, she's good to go for any occasion.
Okay, Jackie.
Let's suit up.
I stole this out of Will's closet.
Why does he have a Peter Pan outfit in there?
We went to Sandy Duncan's yard sale.
Yeah, I picked up a "Hogan Family" crew jacket for just ten bucks.
Fags are a hoot.
this fits a little snug.
ut that's impossible.
Will's like three times my size.
Here, I'll just do one button.
Maybe that'll help.
Darn it!
It's still too tight!
What's going on?
!
Poodle, it's nothing to worry about.
It's probably just monthly bloat.
I just got mine, and now you're getting yours.
You know, when gals hang around together as much as we do they tend to sync up.
At least there's a reason for it.
Hey, is that my jacket?
Looks a little tight on you.
Hey, why you frontin'?
I could fit two of me in one of your Marlon Brando size jackets.
Nonsense.
Oh, gosh.
I'm proud of our little boy.
Graduating from school.
Could I be honest with you, Will?
I've always thought that Jack was an idiot.
Well, now that idiot will hold other people's lives in the palm of his hand.
Will, can I kiss you?
All right.
Hey, lookin' good.
Pants look a little tight, though.
No, they're not.
And stop trying to project your morbid obesity onto me.
Okay.
Guess I've been wearing them wrong.
You know, buttoning and zipping them all these years.
All right, we're dressed, we're coiffed.
You had your surprise colonic.
And you were right, Karen.
I did not see that coming.
Nor I. Now all you need is your speech.
Oh, my God, I forgot to write my speech!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh--!
Jack, Jack.
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
It's okay.
You can do this.
Just talk about why you got into nursing.
I don't know why.
I just kind of stumbled into it.
I'm not like you.
You've always wanted to be a lawyer.
Ever since you were an angry, argumentative baby in pin-striped diapers.
That's not true.
I actually started out as a playwright, and then I went into law.
Playwright?
!
You talkin' about that stupid little play you wrote about being pimply and closeted?
For your information, that "stupid little play" was my coming out story, Bye-Bisexual.
That play was genius.
You--you-- My playwrighting professor, Craig, even said so.
He told me that I was a great writer, and any man would be lucky to have me.
He even took me to a wine bar and then back to his apartment to discuss it.
Wait.
o you wrote a bad play, and you were molested.
Welcome to the theater.
Can we get back to my speech, please?
I only have an hour.
You know, I think I may still have a copy of Bye-Bisexual in a satin box with all of Craig's letters.
So, Karen, what should be in my speech?
I want it to be memorable.
It should have a catch phrase like "I have a dream" or "Whoomp, there it is".
Well Why don't you write about how you wanted to become a nurse because you love helping people.
Good one, Karen.
Come on, Karen.
Be serious.
How does anybody know why they do what they do?
Well, Jackie, let me tell you my story.
Maybe it'll inspire you.
Now God didn't give me the ability to play the piano, or paint a picture, or have compassion.
But he did give me the ability to crack a walnut with my hoo-ha.
Really?
Here, let me show you.
Got it!
Boy, are you guys in for a treat.
Listen to this poetry, even in the opening stage direction.
"Darkness, a sliver of light finds its way upon the stage and lands on a dark chair.
Because it is somewhat dark, we cannot see the whole chair.
More light appears and inhabits the entire chair.
Now we can see it.
A dark chair on a dark stage with some light.
Dim".
Jackie, could you beat me over the head with that candlestick until I black out and die?
You wouldn't know good writing if it slapped you in the face.
Jackie, once I'm dead, could you see to it that I'm slapped in the face?
Come on, it gets better after the, uh, first five pages of stage directions.
Here, here, here.
"Chad, evasively: I don't know why I don't have a girlfriend, Dad.
I-I guess I just haven't met the right--dot, dot, dot--person yet.
But when I meet that--beat--person, I'll introduce you to--beat--them.
Then he addresses the audience.
"There is no them.
Them is he.
I'm gay!
Why can't I tell anyone"?
God, this is awful.
I know, it should've been called Bye-Bye Talent.
That's a good one.
I can't believe this.
All these years, I really thought I had talent.
It's--it's one of the main reasons I feel superior to people.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
You were only 18.
That's like the ninth grade.
-Hey, I bet if you tried writing now, with all your life experience and maturity, you'd be a hell of a lot better.
-I don't know.
Sure you would.
Hey.
Why don't you take a crack at writing my speech, huh?
Yeah, I bet when I read it, if people are moved, you'll know you really do have something.
That's not a bad idea.
I could write it in the limo.
Yeah, honey, why don't you go grab your lucky pen?
-How do you know I have a lucky pen?
-Your kind always does.
Ha ha!
Did you see that, Karen?
Did you see how I tricked Will into doing my speech by pretending to care about his writing?
I did.
Honey, I was proud of you.
Hey, can I be honest with you, Karen?
I've always thought Will was an idiot.
Oh, my God, honey!
I just said the same thing about you a minute ago.
Hello!
Reason we're friends!
Speech, speech.
So, uh, Jack, what was the inciting incident that got you into nursing?
Well I met a cute guy in a nurse's outfit and followed him into the bathroom.
Okay, inquisitive.
"Always had an inquisitive nature".
Go on.
And then I looked over the stall and said "good for you".
"Always had an appreciation of anatomy".
Now, were there any nurses that influenced you growing up?
That would probably have to be Diahann Carroll on "Julia".
And a nurse.
You know, I worked with Diahann on my two-episode arc of "Dynasty".
Yeah, couldn't remember her blocking.
Okay, how 'bout something like this?
"Welcome.
Picture this.
A child in front of a television set fascinated by nurses saving lives.
-Picture this.
The child grown older now.
Inquisitive.
Now, picture this--" -Honey, picture this.
This emery board going into your eye.
All right, let me read what I have so far.
"I wasn't always a nurse, you know.
I was an actor, then a cater waiter, then an actor, then a cater waiter, then a singer, then an actor, then a cater waiter.
" What do you think?
Will, I don't know if this helps you or not.
But while I was in nursing school, I was a cater waiter.
Ooh, okay.
How 'bout this?
"It's like I was born to serve others".
-Honey, you're on to something.
-Ooh, I like it too.
Just add the word "chicken" on the end of the sentence.
Hey, it's Rosario.
Driver, pull over.
Hi, honey.
You look good.
I like those knee-highs.
Are they opaque?
-Forget it.
You're not getting my hoagie.
-Then nobody does.
-Uh, did you get my wrist corsage?
-Yes, I did.
Oh, thank you.
God, could you imagine if I graduate without any flowers on my wrist?
I'd be the laughing stock of all the nurses in all the land.
Okay.
I think I got it.
You ready?
What's going on?
Oh.
Let me get you up to speed.
I own you.
And what we're doing is none of your business.
Lady, don't be surprised if your martinis smell of Clorox tonight.
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Come on.
Okay, now, when you step up to the podium, make sure you have everybody's attention.
Then you begin.
"Friends, parents, and classmates, today I'd like to talk to you about what it means to follow your heart " "And it's no coincidence that nurses, like angels, wear white".
What do you think?
It's really good.
Yeah?
Wh--what about you guys?
Will, can I kiss you again?
Hurt so good.
Come on, baby, make it hurt so good.
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.
You make it, ugh, ugh, hurt so good.
This school is accredited, right?
Oh, my God, I'm next.
I'm so nervous.
I wish I had a prop.
Does anybody have a parasol and two spoiled English children?
Honey, you don't need any props.
Just open with an insensitive racial remark.
They love it.
No!
No props, no remarks.
Just trust the words.
Do it like you did it in the limo.
People will love you.
Here, I've put marks where you should hold for laughs or tears.
-There's a mark in every line.
-Thank you, thank you.
Ooh, nice looking crowd.
Hello there.
Aah!
Stampede!
Ha ha.
The first time I heard that, I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur.
I wasn't supposed to introduce the next person, but Audrey bailed.
She said it was a family emergency, but to me, that's code for vag problems.
-I think I speak for all of us -Ooh, my God, I just realized we forgot to wake up Grace.
Should I call her?
Honey, if you were at home missing this, would you want someone to call you?
I know.
But I want her to hear my speech.
Well, you can read it to her later, honey, when you're moisturizing her.
-If you want to just talk -You're right.
So I gave him a shove out the window.
It wasn't like I was trying to kill him.
Anyway, I think it's time to turn over the podium to this year's most popular student nurse, Jack McFarland.
Friends, parents, and classmates, today I would like to talk to you about what it means to follow your heart.
They say dreams are like soap.
If you don't hold on tight, they'll slip away.
A man who has let go of his dream is like a child who has let go of his balloon.
-I thought dreams were like soap.
-Dreams can be more than one thing.
We are all here today because we refused to let go.
I've always dreamed of the day when I would become a nurse.
Pausing Good.
Ever since I was a child, I knew this is what I was meant to be That's not a pause.
That's where your voice breaks with emotion.
You know what?
I can't do this.
These aren't my words.
No, don't give me credit now.
Do it later with a champagne toast.
This is wrong.
I didn't write this speech.
And you know why?
Because I couldn't think of any reasons why I wanted to be a nurse, because it wasn't my dream.
I wanted to be an actor.
But I let it slip away from me like a soapy balloon.
But standing here in front of all of you right now, reading words I don't believe and don't really understand makes me realize I still want to be an actor.
I had no idea he felt like that.
I love acting!
I love the attention and the applause.
When you're a nurse, the patient gets all the attention.
No.
This is not what I want.
I'm sorry.
I cannot live a lie.
No!
We didn't make a copy!
I'll say it again fags really are a hoot.
Honey, you did the right thing.
I hope so.
You did.
And I could not be prouder.
Hey, you're gonna be a big star.
You're gonna make it big.
And I'm glad that you took this diploma, 'cause you're gonna need it when you fall flat on your ass.
Hey, you're gonna make it big.
And when you don't, you'll have a degree.
So, you go out there and you be an actor.
Until you're a nurse.
Thanks, Kare.
You know, now that I've made this decision, I like a weight has been lifted off of me.
I think this suit actually fits.
-No, it doesn't.
-I said it fits!
Change of subject!
Will.
I feel terrible.
I know he wanted so badly to hear his speech performed.
Honey, she'll be fine.
She doesn't care about that speech.
All she cares about is you.
That's right.
You're what's important to her.
As long as you're happy, she's happy.
Where is she anyway?
And never forget: Dreams are like feathers if you have enough, you can fly.
Wow.
Maybe I will get back into porn.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
So, Karen, I can't believe you're doing this.
Eloping to Vegas.
It's so romantic.
Taking your sacred vows in the city of water slides and titty bars.
What happened to the big fall wedding you were planning?
You know, the three thousand people in St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Did-did the walls start bleeding when you walked in?
I don't know, honey.
We were doing all that wedding planning and all the sudden, Lyle just said, "Hey!
Screw it.
Let's go to Vegas and get married".
He loves Caesar's Palace.
There's a little salsa there.
God, this plane is fantastic!
Thanks, honey.
You know, I am only travelling like this from now on.
How much does it cost to charter a plane like this for the weekend.
Two-hundred and seventy thousand dollars.
You know what else is fantastic?
JetBlue.
So this is fun.
Yeah.
I haven't been on your plane since we flew down to Mexico to smuggle in some new staff for you.
Hee hee!
Grace is going to be so jealous she missed this.
- Why is she missing this?
- Oh.
Work.
She's designing a sex room for one of the gals from "The View".
She can meet us in Vegas tomorrow.
Yeah, Leo's gonna meet us there, too.
Oddly, Cambodia and New York, no direct flights.
Cambodia, Vegas, four shuttles a day.
Yeah.
It's gonna be their big romantic reunion.
I still don't think it's fair.
Why does Grace get to bring her husband, and we don't get to bring our boyfriends?
Oh, come on, honey, you know what would happen.
You gals would get all misty-eyed at my wedding, wanna do it yourselves and put me in the awkward position of having to come out against gay marriage.
You know, that would piss me off if you weren't giving us this free trip.
Oh, sorry, darling.
I'm really not sure about this.
You know, I get petrified about flying.
Oh, darling, I feel bad.
I just took the last 12 Xanax.
I know it's childish of me, but I just have this vision of the plane going out of control and smashing into the side of the mountain.
Ah, listen to me prattling away.
I should just get into the cockpit and have us cleared for takeoff.
Enjoy your flight, everyone.
Ladies and Gentlemen, if you look off the right side of the plane, you can see the mighty Mississippi, celebrated in literature and song.
And off the left side, you can see-- Bloody hell, another plane.
Hang on, everyone!
Okay, kids, here are your packets.
Everything you need once we hit Vegas.
Show tickets, mad money, and if you wanna get some sun by the pool, I threw in a thong and a razor for your ass.
I'm gonna hit the blackjack tables.
I learned how to play on my last gay cruise.
I got pretty good too.
They called me the "BJ Kid".
I hope it was 'cause of the blackjack.
Are you gonna play, Jack?
Oh--No.
All that "hit me, hit me" gets me excited for all the wrong reasons.
You know, we could play as a team.
Maximize our winnings, minimize our loses.
That's what I did on the gay cruise.
Guys wanted to team up with me all the time.
I'd get calls in the middle of the night just asking for the BJ Kid.
Gosh, I'm starving.
Where is that lazy-ass stewardess?
Okay, here we go.
Warm nuts.
Warm nuts.
Warm nuts.
Get your mind out of the gutter.
They're just nuts.
Well, looks like everything's all set for the wedding.
Flowers, clean needles, Jordan almonds Hey, what's this "light beer" on here?
Well, I figured out how the auto-pilot works.
Finally, after two weeks of flying, ha!
Darling, what's with this light beer?
Oh, I like light beer.
I got two going in the cockpit right now.
We can't have light beer at my wedding.
It's tacky.
And I've got these two fags here who are gonna be judging everything I do.
- It's true.
- Well, I want light beer.
- Well, I don't.
- All right, well, we'll discuss this when we get to Miami.
Vegas.
Oh, dear.
Sheesh.
Can you believe him?
Light beer.
What's next?
Non-addictive painkillers?
Karen, marriage is about compromise.
You know, maybe you just let him have this one.
Yeah, in the big scheme of things is it really that important?
I mean, it's beer.
It's not like something crucial like the mini crab cakes.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm making too much of it.
He can have his beer.
Oh, and, Will, uh, we decided against the mini crab cakes.
We're going with the chicken sauté.
Ah, Vegas.
I can't wait to go gambling.
I mean, sure I may lose 100 grand.
But the drinks are free, it all evens out.
I'm just sorry that my daughter couldn't attend our wedding.
And Lorraine could be making so much money on the out-of-towners.
I know.
Who would have thought that there could be such an aggressive strain of herpes that it could keep you from flying.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks so much, darling, for agreeing to get married here.
Well, you know, I'd do anything for you.
Except for what I did last night.
That was just a one time thing.
Lah-ba-da, bee-ba-da Hi, Mrs. Walker.
Mark Juliano, I'm the president of Caesars Palace.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, uh, yes, actually.
I understand that Celine Dion works for you.
I was wondering if you could have her sent up to our room later to give us foot massages.
She doesn't do that.
- How 'bout Elton John?
- Well, he might.
I'll ask.
Ah-ba-da, Bee-ba-da, Doopity-doopity-doo Look, Lyle.
I think I recognize those two from New York.
Isn't it awkward when you meet someone on the plane and then keep bumping into them the whole trip?
I have a big surprise for Grace and Leo when they get here.
I upgraded their room.
And I sent champagne and had them sprinkle rose petals on their bed.
Well, they didn't have rose petals, so French fries.
I figured that would get Grace into bed faster.
Why are you playing Cupid with them?
Is it 'cause you're chubby and five minutes away from a diaper?
Hey.
They haven't seen each other in six months.
I just want their romantic reunion to be special.
You know, when they're standing in that beautiful room, looking into each other's eyes, I want them to think, "I love Will".
Ooh, that reminds me.
I have to get condoms.
Yes!
And that is why they call me the BJ Kid.
Heh.
I hope.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Damn it, I shoulda stayed at 19!
Ah, go ahead, Will, kick me off your team.
I stink at this.
I'm like a bad luck charm.
A big ol' jinx.
No, no, no, we are in this together.
Who cares if one guy's down 240 and the other guy's up 650?
That still leaves the team with 410 dollars.
Minus the $100 initial investment.
That's a $310 profit in a 45 minute period.
Explain that to me again without the numbers and pat my head.
You don't have to do any of the thinking.
Just sit there and look pretty.
Oh, thanks, buddy.
You always look out for me.
Oh, cut that out.
You wanna get us all killed?
I'm as corny as Kansas in August, High as the flag on the Fourth of July.
If you'll excuse an expression I use I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy!
Yeah, well, it'll never last.
Jennifer Lopez?
Shh.
Please, I'm on vacation.
Can I just get a hand towel and a pack of Chicklets?
What?
!
Honey, I don't work here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, you see a white girl in a bathroom, you just assume.
No, honey, don't you remember?
I'm Karen.
We met through Rosario.
You guys used to take tap together in the Bronx way back when.
Oh!
Rosie!
God, I haven't seen her since we performed "Tea for Two" at the Shalom Retirement Center.
How is she doing?
Is she still working on her Masters?
Yeah, she sorta got a little sidetracked.
So, uh, keeping yourself busy these days?
No, kinda taking it easy.
You know, promoting my fragrance.
Uh, shooting a movie in L.A. Working on a new line of track suits.
And studying for my real estate license.
Do you rent or own?
Honey, I own everyone.
Great, well, since you're not up to much, you wanna sing at my wedding tonight?
Ooh, tonight?
UhI'm opening the restaurant.
Mixing a new CD.
Uh, finishing my novel.
So Okay!
Besides, it'll be great to see Rosario.
Does she still wear all those colorful outfits?
Yeah, she's, uh sort of in a gray phase right now.
Well, I guess I'll see you tonight.
Oh, and don't tell my manager.
He'll want ten percent.
Well, here we are, three single men in Vegas.
What sort of trouble are we gonna get ourselves into tonight?
- We were gonna go to Chippendales.
- Oh, I'll see you at the wedding.
Darling, great news.
While I was in the crapper, I found a singer for our reception.
Oh, super, I can't wait to dance the first dance as Mr. and Mrs. Lyle Finster.
What?
!
I ain't changing my name.
I like my name.
- Carol-- - Karen.
- Texas Ranger.
- Walker.
But, darling, if you don't take my name, all the chaps at the gardening club will think me unmanly.
Yeah, well, forget about it.
Ain't gonna happen.
Fine, well, let the castrating commence, eh?
Can you believe him?
Wanting me to change my name.
I've had that name my entire life!
Well, Karen, actually Walker was Stan's name.
Before that you were Popeil and St. Croix.
Your real name's Delaney.
Oh, right.
Zany Delaney.
But I don't wanna go back to that, and I don't wanna give him this either.
But don't you need to change your name every few years to throw the Feds off?
That's true.
And it would be a lot easier than sandpapering off my fingerprints.
Well, all right.
I'll give him this one too.
Damn it!
Busted again.
Yay, 21!
- Thank God we're a team 'cause I am down to my last 10 dollars.
- Yeah, about that, the team's over.
I'm rich!
Can I get you guys to squeeze in a little closer together?
How blessed am I that I get to share this wonderful occasion with the people that I love the most?
Cheese!
All right, now one without the queers.
- Are you still mad at me, Will?
- No, Jack, I'm not a child.
I don't hold silly grudges.
Oh, good.
'Cause look what I bought with my winnings.
- Wow, nice.
- Yeah, and it tells the time in every time zone.
I wonder what time it is on the sidewalk.
Karen, did you just see what Will did?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Would it help if I played with your breasts for awhile?
Whoo.
La la la la.
Hey, weren't you two doing that when I left?
- Hey!
- Honey, Look!
- It's Leo!
- Ooh, somebody lost some weight.
- Ah, thank you.
It was me.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get my watch back from that guy before the ambulance takes him away.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Leo.
- Hey, Karen.
Hi, Leo Markus.
Lyle Finster.
You know, I've heard so much about you.
Karen says that you have all the qualities she looks for in a man.
SoI guess you own a bottle opener.
Keep it on my belt.
Honey, now, could you get out of our picture?
I don't mean to be offensive.
But, uh, this is a Gentiles-only photograph.
Ha ha.
Grace can't wait to see you.
You're all she talked about for four months.
Oh, Grace didn't call ya?
Oh, she's not coming.
She threw her back out installing a rubber swing for one of the ladies on "The View".
I can't tell you which one, but it's not the one you think.
Well, that's terrible.
That means the insurance will go up on all our rubber swings.
So wait, wait, she's not coming at all?
We were gonna get our hair blown out together.
Oh, Will, this must be so painful for you.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, what am I supposed to do?
I can't get married without my best girl.
We're gonna have to postpone!
No, we can't postpone.
I want to start my new life with you right now.
Darling, so do I. Okay, come on, let's do it.
Besides, I'll have lots of other weddings that Grace can come to.
Let's go get our pictures taken in the Jacuzzi.
Well You must be so bummed she's not here.
Hey, come on.
Let's call her.
Yeah, we'll do something cute.
Like talk in chipmunk voices or do a comical rap.
- Come on, let's call her.
- Hey, hey, you know what?
Let's call her later.
I'm dying to go gambling.
You know, I got 112,000 in Cambodia money.
That's almost four bucks of fun.
I can't tell you how proud I am to be part of your special day.
Oh, well, you are a part of it, Rosie.
That's why I want you to walk into that chapel, get down on your hands and knees with some Endust and a shammy and makes those floors shine.
You said I was your bridesmaid.
No.
I said you're the bride's maid.
Now get!
Darling, I want you to meet my brother, Marion.
- Pleasure.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- Marion.
- One more time.
- Marion.
- Ha ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
I keep hearing "Marion".
Well, may I say on behalf of all the Finsters, welcome to the family.
I've always wanted a sister.
Whoa, congratulations, brother.
Okay.
See you in the chapel.
Boy.
Your brother sure can kiss.
That's nothing.
Wait 'til you meet my dad.
Psst.
Will.
Since Grace isn't here, Karen would like you to read this at the wedding.
This is a profile of Amy Brenneman from TV Guide.
- Yeah, but look what she says about love.
- Awww!
Hey there, hockey pucks.
What is this, a moron convention?
Sorry, I just came from the Don Rickles show at the Stardust.
- Are you drunk?
- Little bit.
It's Vegas, baby.
What's the matter with you?
Karen's gonna be drunk.
You don't pull focus from the bride.
I-I-I'm sorry.
I've been in Cambodia.
It's been awhile since I had a drink that wasn't mixed with bacteria.
I said "bacteria".
All the way from "Doctors without Humor".
Listen, I talked to Karen, and she said if you wanna take her plane back to New York, you're welcome to it.
You know, it's just gonna be sitting there 'til Thursday, when it has to bring arms to Panama.
I don't know, you know.
I'm having fun.
Did I mention, it's Vegas, baby?
Yeah, but you can be with Grace in less than four hours.
What?
And miss Karen's wedding.
I love Karen.
And you know who else I love?
You.
Okay, what the hell is going on here?
Jackie, I'm so happy.
And you know, you were right.
Marriage is about compromise.
- I gave up a lot, but I got stuff too.
- Like what, Kare?
Well, Lyle wanted me to walk down the aisle to "Here Comes the Bride".
But then I told him that ever since I was a little girl, I have dreamed that at my fourth wedding I would walk down the aisle to "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones.
And he went for it.
That's great.
But weren't you saving "Sympathy for the Devil" for your fifth wedding?
Honey, that would be in bad taste.
Fifth wedding is traditionally "Smack My Bitch Up" by Prodigy.
No, really, why don't you wanna see your wife?
- Back off, all right.
It's none of your business.
- It is my business.
She's my best friend.
- What is going on with you?
- I'm just not ready to see her yet.
- Why?
I don't wanna talk about this right now.
What the--?
!
Leo, tell me.
- Drop it.
We're in the middle of a wedding.
- Not until you tell me what the hell is going on.
I kissed someone, okay.
I kissed someone when I was in Cambodia.
Here comes the bride.
And she is pissed.
You know, I am very angry with you.
I didn't say anything until now because we were busy consummating our marriage in the cloak room.
You promised that we would walk down the aisle to "Sympathy for the Devil".
I took an executive decision.
You don't get to be president of a company that sells rat traps to breweries without being able to think on your feet.
Lyle, that was very important to me.
Let it go, woman.
We're just about to have our first dance.
I am not speaking to you.
Just did.
- I mean from here on.
- Still doing it.
- Starting now.
- That counts.
- Agh!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am your host for this evening, Jack McFarland.
Hello.
And to honor those of you who have traveled so far from Great Britain to be with us here tonight, I'll be translating my remarks into English.
And now for their first dance as husband and wife And now, for their first donce as husband and wife Please welcome to the fabulous Caesars ballroom Please welcome to the fabulous Caesars bollroom Mr. and Mrs. Lyle Finster.
Mr. and Mrs. Lordy-loo Bumbershoot.
Everyone applauds darling, we're a hit.
Don't you try to make nice with me.
I am furious at you!
I adore you.
Don't change the subject.
I could swim in your bosom for months.
Keep talking.
I could flop on your flesh for minutes.
Oh, Lyle.
How can I stay mad at you?
Not when you repeat our wedding vows.
At this point in the evening, we'd like to invite everybody else on to the dance floor, okay?
Unless your thighs rub together when you walk.
Then, you can sit tight for the cake.
- May I cut in?
- Oh, how lovely.
It's so touching that you're wearing Mother's suit on your wedding day.
Well, well, well.
Even at her own wedding, still sad and alone.
Ah, Beverley Leslie.
What a treat.
I'm so glad I put you in the overhead compartment now.
I am so sorry I missed the ceremony.
But tell me this, darling, do they still say "'til death do us part" when the bride is a vampire?
Darling, it's all right that you missed it.
Probably just as well.
There was some children there, and they get frightened when something your size isn't covered in Muppet fur.
- Shall we dance?
- I'd love to.
Hop on my feet.
There you are.
You just drop this bomb on me about kissing someone, then you walk away?
Did you have a costume change?
Wellyeah.
It's the reception.
Two different outfits.
I also have a cashmere sweat suit for the casino and a silk robe for running to the ice machine.
Wow, is there any part of the stereotype you don't fit?
- So what happened?
Start talking.
- Nothing, nothing happened.
It was a kiss.
I just feel really guilty about it.
'Cause it was with guy?
- What?
!
No.
- Oh.
Sorry, it's just-- It's Grace.
You know, I had to ask.
And now the bride and grown would like you to join them in a sacred expression of their undying love.
The Chicken Dance.
Rosie, you like chicken.
Why don't you lead?
Okay, everybody, just do what I do.
Hit it.
Will!
Leo!
How dare you sit out the Chicken Dance?
There's nothing more insulting to a bride.
Let's go.
- So who is she?
- She's no one.
A volunteer with the Red Cross.
Oh, my God, I saw that on "ER".
Go on.
We had this party on the last night and-- and we all got a little bit too drunk.
We kissed.
That's all.
- That's all?
Nothing else?
- I swear, nothing.
Oh, good.
I was gonna wear something totally different for the Chicken Dance.
Come on, get your arms up.
It's the Chicken Dance.
Not the Chicken McNugget Dance.
- The damn maid of yours is going too fast.
- Oh, Lyle, too bad our father isn't alive to see this.
- He isn't?
- Oh, damn, I knew there was something I was supposed to tell you.
Okay, everybody, wasn't that fun?
Go back to your seats.
Got a special treat for everyone.
Shrimp cocktail.
- Oh, I love shrimp cocktail.
- You get cantaloupe.
Karen, did you talk to Lyle about the music?
Did you tell him you were pissed?
'Cause I'd be pissed.
Yes, I told him how I felt.
He invalidated those feelings.
And then I washed down my rage with several vodka martinis and a pill I found on the floor.
I'm fine.
Why are you trying to make something of it?
!
Oh, I didn't really care that much.
I just wanted to have a dramatic moment with you.
- Well, now you've had it, haven't you?
!
- I guess I have.
Anyway, that's why I've been all weird about seeing Grace.
You know?
I miss her so much.
I just got all of this guilt.
Don't let the Southern accent throw ya.
There's a lotta Jew under here.
So you know what you have to do, don't you?
You have to tell her.
I do?
I was kinda hoping telling you was kinda the same thing.
Oh, it is, don't get me wrong.
But you still have to do it.
Yeah, I know, I just wish there was a way I could soften the blow a little bit.
How do you think it would look on a cake?
Ah, it wouldn't work.
She eats faster than she can read.
She eats faster than she can run.
Look, she's gonna be mad at first, but then, she'll get past it.
I mean, it was just a kiss, right?
- Right.
- Right.
So don't worry about it.
You'll make it through.
You know, your relationship is strong.
In fact, it's you two that give me hope that love can weather anything.
Well, you and-- and Amy Brenneman.
Yeah, you were kinda bawling through that whole TV Guide piece.
The woman's a poet.
I tell you, this is one gay man who will no longer be judging Amy.
Now go call your wife.
Thanks, man.
I'm really happy I married you and Grace.
Sorry, I'm late.
Did I miss the Chicken Dance?
Yeah, you did, honey.
We just finished it.
It was a good one too.
Rosie led it.
Damn it!
You see, Ethan, if you wouldn't have made us wait 'til the end of Psychic Detectives.
- You were watching it too.
- That's 'cause you got me hooked on it.
Oh, with that one that dy kept seeing the red shoe, that freaked me out for a week.
Okay.
Listen, why don't you stretch your queens, and I'll introduce you in a minute?
Come on, guys, limber up.
Which one of you guys is not wearing Glow?
What do you think?
I put that stuff in your Christmas stocking for nothing?
Hi.
Hi, there.
I saw you here, and I totally wanna respect your privacy, but I am such a huge fan.
- Oh, thank you.
- I read everything about you.
You know, People, Us, Star, The Enquirer.
Sometimes I even go online.
I'm sorry, are you saying that the details of my personal life-- the tragedy, the pain, the heartache-- that-- that's entertaining to you?
Oh!
God, yes!
Are you wearing Glow?
Mmm.
Shrimp.
You know what's the best thing about Vegas?
You can just toss the tails right on the floor.
Yeah.
That's why they call it Sin City.
- Do you remember our wedding, Jack?
- Like it was yesterday.
You were a beautiful bride, Rosie.
- You too.
- Oh, Rosie.
Promise me, if in five years, we're still single, you'll be my maid.
- Shrimp?
- Queer!
Hello, everyone.
I'm Karen Finster.
God, I hate that name.
I've got a treat for you.
Whoo!
The hardest working lady in show business.
That's right.
She's an actress.
She's a singer.
She's a dancer.
Oh, my God, she's talking about me.
Oh, my God.
I don't have anything prepared!
Now I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Miss Jennifer Lopez.
Or as she's known to millions of her fans, "Jen Pez"!
Hey, everybody.
I slipped on a shrimp tail.
Ethan, please tell me you didn't rip my jeans.
Everybody out of the way.
Out of the way.
Oh, my God, Jennifer Lopez.
I'll worship you in a minute.
I am an accredited nurse who recently gave it up to pursue acting.
Tell me where it hurts.
Oh, God, please tell me it's not the anterior cruxiate ligament.
Okay, it's not.
I can't do my show unless I have two backup dancers.
- You can't just do it with one?
- No.
- Why?
- Because I need two.
- Can't do it with just one?
- No.
- Why not one?
- 'Cause it's not two.
Damn it!
She's got an answer for everything.
So unless somebody here knows every move of my intricately planned choreography, I'm gonna have to cancel and paid in full.
Miss Lopez.
Miss Lopez, I can do it.
I know all the moves-- Miss Lopez, I can do it.
I know all the steps by heart.
Okay, well, can you do this?
Let me check the butt.
Girl, you're hired!
Thank you.
It is great to be here at the fabulous Caesars Ballroom.
Oh, before we start, I wanna say hi to one of my old friends, Rosario.
Rosie, are you here?
Here I am!
I must have been thinking of a different Rosie.
It's the same one.
WellI changed a lot too.
You know, when Karen asked me to sing at her wedding, I said yes because I believe in love.
I said yes because I believe in the magic that two people can create together.
And I said yes because I get to keep one of the centerpieces.
We love you, Jennifer!
- So I'm gonna do a little number from my new CD.
- No!
Classic J.Lo!
"Waiting for Tonight"!
I can't stop myself.
Okay, "Waiting for Tonight" it is.
Like a movie scene In the sweetest dreams I pictured us together-- Now I feel your lips On my fingertips I have to say is even better-- Than I ever thought It could possibly be It's perfect, it's passion It's setting me free-- >From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried I have spent all of my life Waiting for tonight When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight Thank you.
And congratulations, Karen and Lyle.
And just remember, the secret to a happy marriage is Ah, who am I kidding?
Thank you.
Good night.
Oh, my God.
That was incrediblble.
Thank you, Jenny from the block.
And I'm not fooled by the rocks you've got.
You wanna come up to my room and watch the Iron Chef?
It's all about mushrooms tonight.
- Okay.
Can I keep the doo rag?
- Oh, yeah, keep it.
Ethan's dead to me.
Jennifer, a lotta people say that we have similar skin tone.
Okay, bye-bye, we'll talk later.
Hey.
Yeah, I don't know, Grace.
I-I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.
Yeah, I wish we were together too.
We should come here sometime.
This place is amazing.
Yeah, there's a La Salsa here.
Yeah, baby, there's something I need to talk to you about.
What are you smiling about, handsome?
WellI did that.
He was afraid to call her 'cause they're going through a thing.
And I just said, hey, communicate.
Communication is key.
It's good, right?
I'm Dr. Will.
You get it?
It's like a play on Dr. Phil.
Not as interesting when it speaks.
Hello, everyone.
I just want to say how happy I am to be here at the wedding of my only brother, Lyle.
Now, I don't think Karen knows this, but we Finsters have a longstanding family tradition of inviting the brother into the wedding bed.
Now, now, I'm just joking, if you think that's weird.
Show of hands, how many-- Thank you, Marion.
Yes, it was a mistake having you here.
And now I would like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride.
You know, if you tell my wife, I'm gonna deny this, but for me, Karen Walker will always be the one that got away.
>From what?
I would do anything for her.
She has already done so much for me.
Well I love you, honey.
She let me have light beer when she didn't want it.
She's taking a course in salt water taffy pulling, although she didn't want to.
She's well on the way to becoming a registered rugby referee.
And she has agreed to fund my traveling puppet theater, even though she most certainly did not want to.
She took my name when she didn't want to.
She even got married in Vegas without her best friend.
Even though she didn't want to.
Come up here, my darling.
How lucky I am to find a woman who's happy to mortgage her entire personal identity just for me.
I love you, darling.
Would you like to say something?
I want a divorce.
- Hey.
So you talked to her?
- Yeah.
I was completely honest.
Felt good, right?
See, I knew.
Grace responds to honesty.
She doesn't often use it, but she responds to it.
- So what'd she say?
- She never wants to see me again.
What?
Over a kiss?
Oh, God, let me talk to her.
Okay, maybe you didn't say it right.
I know how to handle Grace.
I told her I was gay, and we're still friends.
You know, and she was way more into me than she's into you.
Yeah, I didn't really tell you the whole story, Will.
It was--it was more than a kiss.
How much more?
We slept together.
I-I didn't plan on it.
I-I didn't mean to.
You know, it just-- it just happened.
One time.
Y-You're still gonna talk to her for me, though, right?
No.
Now you're on your own.
Hey, Leo, did you hear?
I'm going on tour with J.Lo!
I think I may have just lost the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, Leo.
But did you hear?
I'm going on tour with J.Lo!
Karen.
Did you hear?
I'm gonna tour with J.Lo.
Jackie Finney and I are getting a divorce.
Oh, Karen.
But did you hear?
I'm gonna tour with J.Lo!
I mean, doesn't anybody care?
!
I'm gonna tour with Jennifer Lopez!
- I care!
Does she need another-- - No!
