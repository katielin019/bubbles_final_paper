{START OF EPISODE 1}
A little lower, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey?
Oh, hi, honey.
It's you!
The kids aren't back from the airport with Will yet.
In that case, I have an idea.
Take no prisoners, Daddy.
Speaking of prisoners, let's talk about Will.
You know, maybe Bel-Air Prep isn't the right place for the boy.
Maybe he could get more from a different environment.
So could we.
Come on, I'll race you to the Jacuzzi.
Wait a minute, now.
I found a school that's a little further away than we're used to.
How much further?
Switzerland.
Now that that's settled, I'll go fire up the Jacuzzi.
Back it up.
Philip, how could you even suggest shipping Will off to some boarding school?
Okay, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
Will's a great kid, I've even grown to sort of Anyway, I'm sorry I even mentioned Switzerland.
Okay.
- You're forgiven.
- Thank you.
Would you consider Great Britain?
Well, a man can dream, can't he?
Vivian, I'm sorry.
It's just that it's been so peaceful here since Will's been in Philly.
And, boarding school's not so bad, is it, Geoffrey?
Geoffrey went to boarding school.
Tell her, Geoffrey.
Madam, I went to boarding school.
And then I went to therapy.
Who asked you?
Get my lunch.
Right away, sir.
The man has a tapeworm.
Philip, when Will gets here, please be nice.
Otherwise, you're going to be bunking with Mr. Couch.
Woman, please do you think that you can manipulate me with sex?
Does James Brown have a perm?
Oh, Lord, I don't know whether to dive under the table or do the running man.
- G!
- Master William!
Uncle Fink.
Will, it's so nice to have you home.
Uncle Phil, you look great, man.
You look like you lost some hair.
Looks like the whole Jackson family could live in those pants.
Daddy, that's how all the brothers are dressing in Philly.
No wonder Willy Williams moved to LA.
Carlton, honey, what happened?
Will told everyone at the airport I was Bryant Gumbel.
I thought I'd get my luggage faster.
You poor baby, what did they do?
Mob you for autographs?
No, five old ladies attacked me for being mean to Willard.
Hey, it was worth it.
We got the luggage.
My sister.
Daddy, I need $500.
- Will!
- Hil!
Daddy, I need $500.
Hil, you should really consider expanding your vocabulary a little.
Hilary, honey, if it's for the barbecue we're catering this afternoon we have already paid you.
It's not for the barbecue.
I just want $500.
Come on, Hil, please, at least kiss him first.
What is that?
That would be Aisha.
Oh, no.
You're right, Uncle Phil, wrong area code.
That would be Stacy.
Vivian, tell me that's not a beeper.
Can I have one, Daddy?
When Jesse Jackson gets a job.
Will, there'll be no beepers worn in this house.
Yo, what's up, Uncle Phil?
My mom let me wear it in Philly.
That's because she's your mother and she loves you.
I'm your uncle.
I just try not to hurt you.
Come on, Uncle Phil, I need to keep in touch with my tasties.
I beg your pardon?
His tasties, Daddy.
You know, his chubbies, his slimmies, his old ladies?
And, who are you?
Queen Latifah?
See, look Just think of it as honeys on my hip, Uncle Phil, you know?
It's like I need to keep in touch with my squaws, right?
See otherwise, you know, they get all frazzled and frantic and everything.
- You know how it is, right, Uncle Phil?
- No, I do not.
That's because you only got one squaw and you all never go nowhere.
Well, this one squaw says take your behind upstairs, change, and no beeper.
And, Philip, how come we don't ever go nowhere?
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
What about my freedom to express myself?
Will, back off.
The big, fat vein in Daddy's head is starting to throb.
Yeah, and he hasn't given me my money yet.
No, come on, Hil, we cool.
You know it ain't really serious till his right eye start twitching.
Okay, posse up.
And may I say that if you go with our firm it'll be the best decision you ever made.
Well, enough business talk, Mr. And Mrs. Cornfeld.
Please, enjoy the party.
- Thank you.
Call me Norma.
- Norma.
And, you can call me Whitey.
I think not.
Everyone does, on account of my white hair.
White hair.
Hello.
Welcome to our home.
I'm Vivian, Philip's wife.
Vivian, say hi to Whitey.
Hello, Whitey.
Philip, why am I calling that man Whitey?
Yo, yo, yo Mommy and Daddy.
Oh, look.
It's the entertainment.
I think this is our youngest daughter, Ashley.
She just had a brain operation.
Her head's a little swollen, hence the hat.
Very good, honey.
Ashley, what are you wearing?
Will got it for me in Philly.
Ain't it fly?
- Switzerland, Vivian.
- Not far enough, Philip.
Ashley, go upstairs and change right now.
But, I like it.
And if I don't wear it, it'll hurt Will's feelings.
If you do wear it, you'll never see 18.
I never liked Will, anyway.
Will, you must change.
Carlton, you must grow.
Will, you better change before Dad sees you.
What are you talking about, man?
I'm making a statement.
What statement?
"I'm out on parole"?
Will, get away from the buffet table.
Your jail suit is scaring the people away.
With all due respect, Hilary, it's not Will's fault, it's How shall I put this?
The food sucks.
Man, what are you talking about?
It looks good to me.
The pepper's moving.
That is the last time I buy sushi out of the trunk of a car.
Tuna roll?
Will, take off those clothes.
I would, Aunt Viv, but I wouldn't want to make all your guests jealous.
Will, please, these are very important clients.
At least take off that ridiculous hat.
Wonderful party, Banks.
You really know how to court a client.
Thank you.
This is my nephew, Will.
And this is his hair.
It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Call me Whitey.
No, I'm gonna call you that then you gonna call me the other thing, and we're gonna be here fighting.
Will, Whitey is the president of a very prestigious savings and loan.
Oh, really?
Guess a lot of your buddies wearing suits like this now, huh?
Why don't we just go over here, and Move it over here, Whitey.
- You all right, Uncle Phil?
- Will you just insulted a potential Put your hat on.
- You just told me to take my hat off.
- Put it on!
That's me.
Chill, fellas.
I got that right here.
That's Stacy again, sweating me.
You want to handle this one, big guy, or shall I?
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Good call.
Will, I told you there will be no beepers worn in my house.
Well, I didn't really disobey you, Uncle Phil, 'cause, see technically, we not in the house.
Smog.
Get rid of that thing.
Come on, Uncle Phil, what's wrong?
Do you think everybody's gonna think I'm a drug dealer?
Why wouldn't they think I'm a doctor?
'Cause everyone knows Buckwheat never went to medical school.
Will, put your hat back on.
I'm so confused.
Well, let me clarify it for you, Will.
Get rid of the hair, get rid of the clothes, and give me the beeper.
I don't really think that Stacy's your type, Uncle Phil.
Do you think that just because there are a lot of people around you can defy me openly and get away with it?
- Well, I was kind of hoping, since - Get upstairs!
Uncle Phil, man, why you making such a big deal about this?
Boy, as long as you live in my house, you will do what I say.
Maybe I won't be in your house, then.
Good.
- Well, all right.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm out of here, then.
- Bye.
And what are you looking at, Whitey?
I'll help you with those, ma'am.
No you won't, worm head.
And there's more where that come from, chump.
What's up, man?
- What's up, J?
- When did you get back?
I just got back this morning, man.
Man, welcome home.
Later.
Jazz!
Jazz!
Weren't you just here?
I've been gone all summer.
Isn't there something else you'd like to say to me?
Now that you mention it, yeah.
You dating Whoopi Goldberg?
How about "come in," man?
I need a place to crash.
Whoa.
You got a place to crash.
A mansion with a pool, a tennis court and a toilet that flushes without using a coat hanger.
Not no more, man.
Dang, your toilet broke, too?
No, Jazz, it's my uncle, man.
He kicking me all this static.
I told him, "y ou can't accept me for me, I'm out of here".
I'm with you, my brother.
So, I can stay with you?
No.
I already have company.
What company?
Company with breasts.
Look, Jazz, can you ask them to come back another time, please?
Jazz, I'm getting Ionely.
They're Ionely.
Jazz, if you don't let me stay here, I'm going to be out on the street, man.
Jazz Sorry, my brother but those are the harsh realities of the cruel world in which we habitate.
And now, booty awaits me.
Jazz, if our friendship means anything to you, you'll open this door right now.
I walked 10 miles and took four buses to get here, now open this door.
That's more like it.
Don't tell me I can't stay at your crib.
We supposed to be boys.
You got some girl up in there, you won't What's up, man?
Dang, I thought I was having a bad hair day.
You going bald, man.
You about to look like my uncle in a minute.
I never had a dog, man, so you know, we going to swing out for a little bit, all right?
You're the only friend I got, man.
This is a black thing, right?
You're going to pee on my foot.
All right, you got that.
Damn!
You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.
Who said that?
You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.
I heard you the first time.
You have 10 seconds to move away before the a/arm activates.
Oh, really now?
Ten seconds, I knew you was full of it.
Chill, chill!
Who are you talking to, son?
Actually, I was talking to the car, Officer.
Oh, the car talks?
No, it's kind of fly, actually.
Check it out.
No, no, chill, no, watch.
No, no, wait, wait, hold it.
Check it out, check it out.
The car, it say, "move or I'll kill you," or something like that.
Guess the cat's got its tongue.
Damn!
You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.
Philip, Will's been gone for seven hours now.
What if something's happened to him?
Don't try to cheer me up, Vivian.
Philip, I'm serious.
Do something.
What do you want me to do?
I've got Geoffrey out scouring the city.
I'm terribly sorry, sir, I've looked everywhere.
There isn't an ice cream sandwich left in this town.
Vivian.
Ashley, what are you doing out of bed?
I'm worried about Will.
Why did you throw him out into the street, Daddy?
I did not throw him into the street.
Quite right, sir.
You threw him on the lawn.
He rolled into the street.
Daddy, we couldn't find Will anywhere.
And, sorry, no ice cream sandwiches.
Looks like you really blew it this time, huh, big guy?
I just hope the Willster's still breathing.
Will!
Oh, honey, thank God you're safe.
Hi, Aunt Viv.
You stink.
Boy, it's good to be home.
Is there a problem, Officer?
Oh, right.
Just 'cause I come in the crib in the middle of the night escorted by a police officer, you think something's wrong.
See how he be trying to play me, Fred?
Thank you so much for bringing him home, Officer.
Well, Will, I guess I better beat it.
- Good night, folks.
- Good night.
What, I got a boogie?
Will, I am very disappointed in you.
I can't believe the trouble you've caused this family.
Your aunt's right.
You've been back from Philly one day you insult a client and you storm out of this house like a crazy man and worry this family half to death.
And I don't appreciate the influence you're having on your cousin Ashley.
He's not a bad influence on me, Daddy.
I have a mind of my own.
If that's okay with you.
Look at that.
It's like you got her brainwashed.
That's right, and it took me 13 years to do it.
- Dad, can I say something?
- What is it, Carlton?
You forgot the part about Will getting arrested.
You all trying to play me like that, right?
What if he told you that you couldn't wear plaid anymore?
Don't joke about that, Will.
What if he told you that you couldn't entertain men in the Jacuzzi anymore?
When did you have a man in the Jacuzzi?
This isn't about me.
It's about Will.
Come on y'all.
It's about all of us.
I mean, look, we're young adults here.
I mean, we have a right to our own opinions.
Yeah!
Look, today it's my beeper, tomorrow it's going to be who you can date or how to vote, or what college to go to.
That's such bulldoody.
Dad knows I'm going to y ale.
You're going to Princeton.
I don't want to go to Princeton.
Hold on a minute.
I want to know when you had a man in the Jacuzzi.
Look, that's my private life.
That's between me, that man, and his video camera.
Look Uncle Phil, I'm saying, what's the difference between me wearing this, and you in the sixties?
You wore a dashiki and an afro.
But I was making a cultural statement.
You're just drawing attention to yourself.
But, now correct me if I'm wrong but you don't think a 6'3", in a dashiki and an afro the size of West Philly is drawing attention to himself?
I am just trying to save you from going through the same hassles that I went through.
But I'm saying, why would you want to?
Look how good you turned out.
Yeah, Daddy.
He's got you there, big guy.
I'm with Will, Dad.
Good.
Well, Will I hate to admit it, but I guess you have a point.
I do?
Just because you live in my house doesn't mean I can control you.
It don't?
So, you can express yourself any way you want to.
Keep the clothes, keep the hair and the beeper.
Knock yourself out.
All right.
But, you know Now, I've been thinking.
You know, I have a need to express myself, too.
I don't know, Uncle Phil, you might be able to get one little twist right here No, no, no, that's not quite what I had in mind.
You see, I can't force you to do anything you don't want to do.
But, these are my kids.
So, as long as you keep the hair the clothes and the beeper you're all grounded.
Good night.
Nice try.
All right, look y'all, this is a classic case of divide and conquer.
Look, Malcolm warned us about this.
Get him!
We're going to swing out for a little while, all right?
'Cause you're the only friend I got right now.
Lift!
Lift!
Lift!
Lift!
Lift!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Shabba!
- Will, get your feet off the furniture.
- I'm sorry about that, Uncle Phil.
- Why aren't you doing your homework?
- No, see, I was just How many times have I told you not to eat on the couch?
And while we're on the subject It's kind of fly, right?
Don't you wish you lived on TV?
Must be what it sounds like to wake up in Little Richard's crib.
What's with Dad, anyway, waking us up at 6:00 a. M?
Now I'll never know how that dream ends.
She dumps you, Carlton.
Hey, look, all I'm saying is, just 'cause he own the crib and pay all the bills and everything, he think he can tell us what to do.
Now, I don't know about y'all, but I ain't having it.
I think it's time for somebody to straighten him out.
Step to it, Ash.
Will, we're going to go down and help rebuild the old neighborhood and I don't want any attitude from you.
What?
I had a fabulous time, Wesley.
Why don't you come in?
Don't be silly, they won't be up for hours.
Night, Sister Mary Margaret.
Daddy, have you lost weight?
Hilary.
Sister Mary Margaret drives a Porsche?
Man, they must got it going on down at the convent, huh?
Hilary, what were you doing out all night?
I wasn't out all night, I just got up early to go to mass.
- We're not Catholic.
- Well, is my face red.
Good night.
Hold it, young lady.
I want you to go upstairs and change your clothes.
We're meeting Reverend Williams and the church group in half an hour.
Excuse me?
You said you'd come down to the old neighborhood with us.
Remember?
I also said Daddy lost weight.
Hilary, go change your clothes.
Now!
This is too important.
I'm not gonna let you get out of this.
Boy, Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv sure are hyped up about going down to their old neighborhood.
Brother, I can just hear them now: "Look, kids, this is where we lived when we first got married.
"And this is the little park where we walked little Hilary".
"And, look, there's the pet store where we bought little Carlton".
I think it's cute.
They're going to be mushy and lovey-dovey all day.
Vivian, what the hell is the matter with you?
You've been avoiding me ever since I got home yesterday.
What did I do?
Come on, tell me.
Is it something that I did, or something that I didn't do or Oh, my God.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
- It's not our anniversary, Philip.
- Oh, God, good.
Well, what is it?
- You're wearing that shirt.
- Why not?
It's my around-the-house shirt.
I've worn it around the house every weekend for years.
That's what I mean.
Philip, you have become so predictable.
Vivian, don't you think you're being just a wee bit erratic this morning?
Absolutely not.
Philip, look at my hair.
I can't go out like this.
I gotta go to the salon.
Well, you went yesterday, sweetheart that's why we couldn't have lunch together.
Right, you're right.
Henri tried something new, do you like it?
Will, what do you think?
Will!
Well, actually, Aunt Viv, you got a kind of a Don King Kris Kross, Bride of Frankenthing going.
Not many people could pull it off.
You know, as you're proving, right, but What, Carlton?
Vivian, where were you yesterday?
Shooting baskets with Michael Jordon.
You know, Clair would never talk to Cliff like that.
What, Carlton?
Yo, my brother, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going.
It's Hammer time.
Sorry about that, man, you know, you have to excuse my cousin you know, he's an idiot.
Carlton, can you please relax, man?
Okay, I won't say another word.
I won't even make eye contact.
Oh, God, what a stallion.
Time to saddle up.
Yo, what's up, baby?
Hurry up, write your number down before I don't want it no more.
I'm sorry.
How are you doing?
I'm Will and this is my cousin, Carlton.
Hi, I'm Simone.
Thanks for coming down.
I'm going to show you what to do.
And I'm going to buy you a car.
No, thanks.
But I do need a strong pair of arms.
That would be me.
I got that.
Carlton can't help you, he's on the debate team.
Really, I'm captain of my debate team.
Simone, where you want me to go with this?
How about over there somewhere, like, say, Cleveland?
Tell me to go to Cleveland, mushroom head.
Well, I guess we better get busy.
All right!
Oh, right.
Listen, Simone, why don't you come by the school on Monday we're debating Roe v. Wade.
Oh, reproductive rights!
No, row versus wade, the best way to cross a stream.
You've got a great sense of humor.
Yeah, I know.
- What's the matter?
- It's just a splinter.
Better let me take a look at that finger for you.
- Damn!
- Problem, sir?
It's Vivian.
I don't know what's gotten into her.
This morning she told me that I've become too - Predictable, sir?
- Yes, that's exactly what she said.
- She said that I wear the same - Blue shirt every weekend, sir?
Yes, I mean, just because a man has Froot Loops every morning.
- Just because I watch - Lega/ Beag/es every night.
Does that mean that I've become predictable?
Absolutely not, sir.
Why, you're a regular hotbed of spontaneity.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
Hilary, why doesn't anyone want my soda?
Because your soda's flat.
Do you believe this mess, man?
I thought we was here to work.
Don't even sweat it, man.
Most of those fools ain't coming back here, anyway.
A few more months, everybody's conscience will be cleared and things will be back to status quo.
Half these people don't even understand what really went down here, man.
Yeah.
- Hey, I'm Noah, man.
- Hey, what's up?
Will.
And then when I was 12, I played Maria in an all-boy production of West Side Story.
Carlton, slow down.
I want to hear more about your collection of Sea-Monkeys.
Will you marry me?
Well, there go the nerdyweds.
Vivian, wait.
Now, you cannot avoid me all day.
Now, where were you yesterday?
Philip, I love you sweetheart.
Trust me, you're my husband.
And, as your husband, I have a right to an explanation.
And, as your wife when I think of something, you'll be the first one to know.
Don't I'm not finished with you yet, woman.
Well, I'm through with you, man.
Yeah, that's right, I'm bad.
Man, I'm beat.
Got blisters on top of blisters.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, so what time you coming back tomorrow?
I can't make it tomorrow, man.
I got school and everything, you know.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'll get with you next weekend, then.
Oh, man.
Well, I can't make it next weekend, you know I got a date on Saturday and then I got a ball game on Sunday.
- So, you know how it is, man.
- Yeah, I know how it is.
You're not coming back.
Wait, hold up, man, I'm coming back.
No, you're not, man.
I bet you feel pretty good about yourself, don't you?
I mean, you come down here, do the right thing then you go home patting yourself on the back 'cause you helped out the poor folk.
Hold up, man.
Yo, I'm from Philly.
We had to save up to be poor.
Why you sweating me like this man, what's up?
'Cause, you're just like all the rest of them.
You come around here with the X cap and them cool Doc Martens and you're all "dope" and "word to your mother".
And you think that makes you committed?
Let me tell you something, this ain't no game.
And if you think that it is, then maybe you should go home 'cause you're not welcome here.
Tell Dan Quayle I said, "What's up".
Now I'm not welcome here, right?
Well, you got your story a little wrong, homey.
This community appreciates me.
I don't even know Dan Quayle.
Hey, I'm going to knock your head off, slimeball.
Yo, man!
Help!
Shut up, bad man.
Put your hands up and put down the toaster.
Put your hands up in the air, put down the toaster.
Make up your mind, man.
What do you want me to do first?
Will!
What the hell is going on in here?
Dad, don't do anything stupid, you haven't updated your will yet.
Oh, my God.
Hector?
Yeah, what?
Wait Wait a minute, I know you.
Yeah, ain't you the guy from Fami/y Matters?
- Yes!
- No, I'm Philip.
Philip Banks.
- Curly?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Curly?
They must go way back.
Vivian, come here quick.
Oh, my God, what's it been, years?
Oh, I don't believe it.
It's Hector Alvarez.
Oh, kids, look it's Hector.
Hector!
How are you?
- You look wonderful.
- So do you.
- Who's Hector?
- I don't know, but be nice to him he's got a bat.
Stay where you are, punk.
I caught this little creep stealing.
I'll go call the police.
I got a quarter.
Now, hold on.
Hector, there must be some mistake.
This is y eah, this is our nephew, Will.
You mean little Willie from Philly?
But, of course, who else could it be with those muy grandes orejas?
- What does that mean?
- Big ears.
Hector, let me see that bat for a second.
I'm sorry about the bat, folks.
You know, I guess I'm a little jumpy.
I've been robbed a couple of times, man.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Hector.
- Yeah.
Come on, now, kids, you remember Hector.
I'll remember him now!
Sweetheart, before you were born, we used to live here.
Right above Hector's grocery store.
Wait, this is the old apartment?
Hector, I love what you've done with the place.
Well, we didn't have a lot, but we always had enough to eat - thanks to Hector.
- That's right.
Even if you didn't have any money, you had all the food you needed long as he liked you.
I guess y'all was in love then, huh, Uncle Phil?
So, Perry Mason, how is the crusading business coming, man?
Are you still fighting for little guys like me?
Well, I'm still fighting, but it's corporate mergers mostly.
So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore?
Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger but it's just a few miles from here.
You work in Beverly Hills, Uncle Phil.
Beverly Hills.
Hey, Curly, that's terrific!
Hey, maybe now you can pay me back for some of those Ring Dings?
He ain't doing that well.
Hector, I just cannot believe our old apartment went up in flames.
Yeah, there's been a lot of changes since you've been gone.
It's still nice to have you back.
Well, look, I'll be downstairs.
You know what?
I never gave you kids a wedding present.
Best of luck, huh?
You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I used to love coming out here to visit y'all.
Hey, Ashley, check this out.
This is where Aunt Viv used to measure how tall we was getting.
- Look, here's me.
- Will, there's you.
Look, there's Carlton.
You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, there was a lot of love shared in this room.
Don't even think about kissing me.
Hilary, time to set the table.
Baby, why are you throwing your doll in the garbage?
Well, I tried flushing her down the toilet, but the little creep floats.
I want a new doll.
Baby, it's all we can afford right now.
With all the free legal aid your daddy gives we're barely covering expenses but there are more important things in life than fancy clothes and big houses.
What have you been smoking?
Yo, Uncle Phil, how you going to play a nephew?
On his behind, Will.
That honey was about to invite me up for some milk and cookies.
That honey was old enough to be your mother.
Word up, and she was divorced, too.
Parents just don't understand.
Hey, big guy, got time to read me a bedtime story?
Sure, Carlton, what's it going to be?
Cat /n The Hat or Curious George?
No, The Wa// Street Journa/, the part where AMC goes belly up.
Are you sure we're all related?
Mom, Dad, I've been thinking it over and I've decided what I want to be when I grow up.
What, tall?
- That's nice, honey, what?
- President of the United States.
Well, that would make me very proud, Carlton.
Imagine, my son, the country's first black president.
I'm black?
Hello?
One second, please.
Philip, it's Mr. Firth from the law firm.
Hello, Mr. Firth?
Yes.
I would love to meet with the other partners.
Next Thursday is great.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right, hold it now.
Don't want to get anybody's hopes up but Mr. Firth wants me to come back for a second interview.
I'm rich!
I'm rich!
I'll pack our bags.
Maybe we can get a place close to the Reagans.
Did I ever tell you folks how much I like visiting?
Hold on, now.
Hold on.
Now look even if I do get this job, nothing changes.
This is our home and this community is a part of our family.
And I'll never turn my back on it.
We had some good times in this old place.
We sure did, baby.
Our roots are here.
This is where we started our family.
Man, I wonder if that divorced lady still live here?
She probably like 127 or something y eah, and we made some very good friends here.
But we haven't fulfilled our commitment to them or to this place.
Look, you know, Uncle Phil, I think I will come back you know, next weekend.
Hook up with my man Noah, set up a schedule.
Yes, I think I'll hook up with Simone and make out a little schedule of my own.
I'm going to go sign up for next week.
So, the house will be empty next week?
Great!
I'm going to plan a party.
I guess you're really disappointed in me, huh, Vivian?
- Why?
- 'Cause I sold out.
Did everything I said I wouldn't do.
Became a high-powered lawyer bought that house in Bel-Air, and never looked back.
Philip, honey, you shouldn't feel guilty about your success.
Baby, nobody gave you anything.
You have worked hard for everything you've got.
You've been generous and you've contributed to a lot of causes.
It takes more than just writing a check.
I've lost myself, I've lost my fire, my passion.
You're right, Vivian, I have become dull and predictable.
- Philip.
- I want to be the kind of man you fell in love with.
I want to be open to risks, I want to take chances.
Oh, Philip, do you mean it?
Do you?
I'm afraid it's too late.
I've chased you away.
Philip, what are you talking about?
I know where you were yesterday.
You're having an affair.
I don't blame you, I'm just going to kill you.
Oh, no, is that where you thought I was yesterday?
What?
You mean, you weren't with another man?
- Of course not.
- Lucky for you.
Philip, I was afraid to tell you because I didn't think you could take it.
- You didn't think I could take it.
- No.
But now I know you can.
- Philip, I was at the doctor's yesterday.
- The doctor's!
Philip, I'm pregnant!
So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore?
Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger and I only And, it's pretty good.
- Hold it!
- Oh, you don't say.
- That's all right.
- Yeah.
Stuttering.
Bad word!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hi, little one.
Of course, you won't make an appearance for about six months now but I thought you'd like to meet your family.
I'm your daddy.
Can you say "daddy"?
And here Here is your mommy.
And here is you.
Hello in there.
Mommy, why don't we call the kids down and tell them that you're pregnant?
Kids!
Kids!
Come on down, we have a big surprise for you.
Oh, check it out.
LAPD, The Home Game.
We're making a movie?
Here, check it out, Uncle Phil.
Hold on.
I have fallen and I can't get up.
Will.
Kids, come on now, brace yourself.
I have some very important news for you.
Okay, but I'm living with the one who keeps the house.
No.
We're not getting a divorce, stupid.
We're having a baby.
Wait.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
You and you?
This is serious.
We're having a baby.
Yo, they ain't laughing, y'all.
Okay, I think I speak for everyone when I say: Ew!
And I'm not baby-sitting.
I'm not changing diapers.
And I'm not sharing my trust fund.
Let's try this again, shall we?
Now, kids, I have great news.
We're going to have a baby!
Yay.
Good morning, honey.
Going to the electric chair?
Philip, since I got pregnant, I can't stop eating.
But, honey, you got to be careful of what you eat.
Remember, baby, you're eating for two now.
You better watch it, since I could get used to all this attention, you know.
That's fine with me, baby.
Let me take care of you.
No, no, that's all fat.
No, no, all sugar.
No, no, that's all right.
The catering business is so unfair.
I mean, a couple of nuns get botulism and all of a sudden, I'm blacklisted.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's too bad.
So how's the apartment hunting going, honey?
Excuse me?
Hilary, we've been over this.
With the baby coming, we're going to need the room.
Wait a minute.
I have to move out?
Whose fault is it that she's pregnant?
Besides, we have three extra bedrooms.
Yes, and we don't want you in any of them.
Philip.
Hilary, honey, what your father's trying to say is you don't live here anymore, honey.
But this is all so sudden.
I mean, like, if I'd only had some kind of warning or something.
Hello, is this on?
Where do you expect me to go?
I don't have anything saved.
Honey, we'll pay first and last month's rent.
- What about the months in between?
- Get a job.
Again?
What a week.
First, those damn nuns, now this.
Hey, what's up, Hil?
A word to the wise, Will: Stay in high school forever.
Bet.
- Hey, good morning, y'all.
- Good morning.
I just want a sticky bun.
I'm just going to get a sticky bun.
Mom, I look dorky.
Oh, honey, you look adorable.
You're just nervous about your first day at a new school, but don't be, come on.
- You're going to make a lot of new friends.
- What if no one likes me?
Just do what Carlton does: Give them money.
Sweetheart, you're going to be all right.
You have a wonderful personality.
Oh, great, now I'm ugly.
You are not ugly.
You are beautiful and you're smart.
And you're going to have a fabulous day at your new school.
Okay?
And I'm going to be here when you get home and I want to hear all about it.
Okay?
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
This is a great day.
Little Ashley joining me at Bel-Air Prep.
Hey, I thought you asked Dad to send me to public school.
Merely a trial balloon.
The fact remains that I love you.
But if we run into each other at school, act like we've never met.
Don't acknowledge me, don't talk to me, act like I'm invisible.
If you're not sure how, just do what all the other girls do.
Look, I'm serious.
This is my senior year, and I don't want you tagging along.
I've worked too hard at becoming popular.
And any day now, it's going to kick in, right?
Darn tooting.
Hey, look.
I just think it's about time Bel-Air Prep went coed.
There's going to be cute girls everywhere.
Cute, rich girls that know the one thing their parents can't stand is for them to be dating a big black dude.
Will, can I hang out with you until I make some friends?
Oh, yeah, sure, Ash.
Just look for the huddle of girls with the chocolate center.
It's a disgrace.
It's a scandal.
It's an outrage!
It's the mother of my children.
Carlton, look.
The way to make an impression is to relax, man.
You got to be calm, chill out a little bit.
Hurt me!
Hurt me!
What's up, baby?
The name's Veronica.
Veronica, I likes that.
Great.
Now, I can die.
Hold up, baby.
See now, I noticed you noticing me.
So I just want to put you on notice that I noticed you, too.
And?
And to let you know that, you know, I might consider letting you be with me.
Is that what passes for a compliment around here?
- Look, baby, listen.
- No, you listen.
If you want a shot at being with me maybe you should try talking to me like a human being, okay?
Got it?
Actually, baby, you got it, but I take donations.
Dag, Will.
You sure have a way with the ladies.
Hey, man, what's your secret?
Well, I would like to help you out, my brother.
But, you know, it's a chemical thing.
You drug them?
No, no, no.
Look, Kenny, it's instinct.
Like, you know the old saying: "Those who can, do, those who can't, teach"?
Well, I can and I do.
That's deep, man.
Slide over here for a second.
I'll give you a few pointers.
Incoming!
Well, Carlton, here we have a couple of particularly impressive competitors.
Judges!
Will, the judges like her.
They really, really like her.
And let's hear it for the East German team!
- Hi, Carl.
- Out of the way, Ashley.
I'm trying to see.
Ashley, watch out!
I can't believe how hard it is to find a beachfront place with a pool and tennis court for $500 a month.
I mean, what's happening to this country?
It's enough to make me want to vote.
Maybe you should lower your standards a little.
You're not going to be happy until I'm living in a trailer, eating Spam on Ritz.
I mean, that's where this is going, isn't it?
Sweetheart, I found a few places that don't look so bad.
I'm beginning to get the idea that you want to get rid of me.
Run with that.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- So how was the first day at school?
- Way cool, grand hombre.
Yo, Uncle Phil, it was booming, man.
Tasties everywhere.
I mean, big ones, small ones, short ones, tall ones Black ones, brown ones, rich ones, poor ones, crazy ones.
Well, your aunt and I used to It's not important.
Carlton, I thought you were against girls at Bel-Air Prep.
Well, I'll be the first to admit I had great reservations about it but I've already learned that many of my assumptions about the opposite sex were just plain wrong.
And that was just from 10 minutes of hiding under the bleachers.
Hey, guys.
Come on over here.
You know, that reminds me of my freshman year at college.
Now, for extra money, I had to work for the Princeton Dai/y.
And my first assignment was to interview the town's most famous stripper Boom Boom LaSalle.
I wonder why they called her that?
For some reason, I don't know what, she kind of took a liking to me and so she invited me to go with her and her sister to their dressing room for drinks.
You the man.
Anyway, one thing led to another and before I knew it, this old country boy finished his y oo-hoo and went right home.
Wait a minute, Philip.
Go back to where you finished your y oo-hoo.
Ashley!
Ashley, baby, I'm sorry.
- How was school?
- School was fine.
- Did you make any new friends?
- A few.
I've got to go study.
Well, did some of the boys try anything with you?
No, nothing.
Nothing at all.
Uncle Phil, you'll be happy to know that none of the boys tried nothing with me, neither.
There you go noticing me again.
I'm telling you, she wants me.
She senses my raw animal power and is incapable of turning away.
She senses that big, wet, nasty blob of mayonnaise on your cheek and she can't eat till you wipe it off.
- So, yo, you seen Ashley today?
- No.
- Me neither.
I wonder where she at.
- I don't know and I don't care.
As long as she doesn't try to sit with me again.
It's kind of hard to impress the honeys when your baby sister's blowing bubbles in your milk.
Will, check out the talent.
She's cool!
She's hot!
- She's - y our baby sister, man!
Ease back, man, ease back.
What do you think you're doing?
- Buzz off, short stuff.
- That's it, Ashley.
I want you to I'm ordering you to look unattractive.
Ashley, who did you have for breakfast, some hormones or something?
Beat it.
I'm working the room.
Hi, Bobby.
Where'd she learn to walk like that?
Yeah, where'd she get that Lee Press-On body?
Hurt me!
Hurt me!
Yo, baby.
You see, I noticed you noticing me.
And I wanted to give you notice that I noticed you, too.
Baby, you float my boat.
I know you better float your midget boat on out of here.
Will, man, ease up.
No, you ease up, man.
What do you think you're doing?
The same thing that you do.
I'm just trying to press up this woman.
That ain't no woman, that's my cousin.
I am too a woman, and I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my business.
Don't you shake your neck at me like that, girl.
- Come on, Kenny.
- Hey.
And don't you shake that either.
I did it.
I found the perfect place, and it's within my budget.
- You did?
- That's great, baby.
You guys were right.
I do have what it takes to survive.
And it's true what they say: "You give a man a fish, you feed him for a day" But you give a man a cow and he can eat for a month, maybe more.
Don't, don't, don't.
She's on a roll.
This place has got it all.
Pool, tennis, and full utilities.
And I won't need any more than the $500 a month that Daddy promised me.
- That's an incredible deal.
- Unbelievable, even.
- I think we should see this place.
- Well, if you want to.
- I wouldn't miss it.
I'll get the car keys.
- You're not going to need them.
Why?
Is it in the neighborhood?
You're getting warmer.
Well, where is it, exactly?
I'm going to live in the pool house.
You said I had to be out of the house, but not off of the property.
And with the money that Daddy promised me it will cover my furniture rental.
Philip!
Philip, honey.
Honey, we're getting off easy.
- Come on.
- But it's not fair.
She's winning!
Baby, I'm telling you.
You've got more moves than a bowl of Jell-O.
And there's always room for Jell-O.
Wow.
Dude sounds like a jackass.
Actually, Will, he sounds like you.
- So, Kenny, when are we going out?
- I don't know, baby.
You have to let me check my book, and I'll get back to you.
You see, I want to make sure I can give you my undivided attention.
Actually, Will, he's better than you.
I mean, look at you, you got it going on.
You got sweet hips, lips and fingertips.
But, baby got back!
Bye, baby.
Wait a minute!
Will.
Will, I know my sister needs me, but that girl was babelicious.
Carlton I think you know what you have to do.
I know.
Still I would have liked to have been there for Ashley.
Hey.
I was so sure looking like this would make me popular.
I mean, what do guys want, anyway?
Ashley, look, guys want a girl who's sweet and kind and smart.
Just like you.
Kenny wanted the girl with back.
Ashley, look, Kenny's a special case.
Carlton wanted the same girl.
Well, see, Carlton's a basket case.
What about all the boys in the hall yesterday?
- See, Ashley - And all the guys in the beer commercials?
- Look, Ashley - And all the guys who ask Hilary out.
Look, all right, okay.
Look, Ashley, I can't lie to you, all right?
Some guys don't know what's special about a woman.
Actually, a lot of guys don't know.
Well, really, damn near all guys don't know.
Look, Ashley, there's still some guys that appreciate quality, you know?
And you're quality.
You don't got to do all this.
Just work on being you.
I'm telling you, the right guy will come along.
I promise you.
Okay.
Have your people call my people.
We'll do lunch.
Give Mama a kiss, baby.
- I'm really glad you're my cousin.
- Mama know.
Go on, girl.
Veronica you know, I've thought about what you said yesterday and you know, I just wanted to tell you, you was right.
I'm sorry about the way I behaved and I'd be real grateful if I could have your number, so I could call you.
That's really nice.
What did I say?
What did you say?
Yeah.
You thought over what I said, and I was right.
What did you agree with?
Yo, it was deep.
I agreed with all of it.
You have no idea what I said, do you?
Wait, hold up, girl, you tripping.
I know what you said.
You, you 'Cause we was right here.
You said that people who live in glass cribs shouldn't throw hard stuff.
No.
"Let your smile be your umbrella"?
Come on.
Who cares what you said, baby.
I'm saying I'm trying to be with you.
That's the first honest thing you said to me.
That's like a good thing, right?
That's a very good thing.
That's what I'm saying!
Write down your number!
You can't get it yet.
But I've got your number.
Hey.
Hold up.
Am I as superficial as all those guys I warned Ashley about?
I mean could it be that I'm more obsessed with breasts and thighs than Colonel Sanders ever was?
Mightn't I be able to look deeper?
I mean, to cherish women as full and complete and complex individuals.
And with this new understanding to finally find and keep this true love that eludes so many of us.
Nah!
Yo, baby, I know your feet must be tired 'cause you been running through my mind all day.
Come here, girl!
How are we supposed to translate Cicero with a bunch of girls glossing their hair, and glossing their lips and messing up lines and just trying to cover it, but not being able to do it.
Now, we got a lot of women in the audience.
Any of y'all ever glossed your hair?
Because I don't know.
Maybe it's a new cu/t thing or something, that / don't know about.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
These kids have got to be more sensitive to these bills.
I mean, look at them, they're Out of sight.
- Philip, stop looking at my chest.
- I'm sorry, honey.
It's just that ever since you've been pregnant they're back.
Is that all I am to you is a bustline?
I'm sorry.
Did you say something, honey?
- Hey, morning, y'all.
- Hey, baby.
Hey, check this out, Aunt Viv.
What are you doing?
I learned in biology class that, you know, babies can respond to music while they still in the womb.
You know, like when you was carrying Carlton you kept listening to /t's a Sma// Wor/d After A//?
Oh, the baby's kicking.
Who's that singing?
Just a little Heavy D for Heavy V. Will, it's bad enough you have an influence on Ashley.
Hands off the fetus.
All right, look, well, come on, can we at least make the kid be righteous?
You know, like let him have an African name like Brother Outaphilia.
Oh, hey, check it out, I got him a gift.
Little itty-bitty X cap.
Little teeny-weeny Doc Martens.
Too cool for pre-school, right?
Will, honey, why all this sudden interest in the baby?
Well, I mean I've been able to save Ashley, but as far as your other two kids Let's just say they a couple of wings short of a bucket.
Just one minute, there is nothing wrong with Hilary and Carlton.
Daddy, how do you expect me to support myself if you don't increase your credit card limit.
Dad, I decided to throw caution to the wind.
V-neck!
Coincidence?
I think not.
Allow me.
- Dad, I'd like to try something out on you.
- Carlton, please.
Do I have to sit through your Urkel impression again?
Maybe later, but right now I've been reading this book on negotiating - and I'd like to practice my technique.
- No.
I'm gonna look you straight in the eye and ask you again.
No, and get some Binaca.
Come on, big guy, work with me.
I'd like a raise in my allowance.
- All right, how much?
- $75,000.
- Are you insane?
- The book says start high.
And obviously you are.
- I'll give you $3 more a week.
- Gee, thanks, Dad.
Now I can stop taking money from your wallet.
Sorry, Margo, I can't make the Neiman sale.
No, now that I'm living on my own I have to do my own grocery shopping.
I know.
Okay, bye.
Hilary, honey, I'm really proud of you.
I don't think you've ever gone grocery shopping.
Well, I guess it's time I spread my wings.
This is the last time I shop here for fruit.
Oh, that's okay, Daddy.
You don't have to carry it, I'm a big girl.
Let go, Daddy.
Do your own shopping.
Dad, if you'd put a bell around her neck we'd at least know when she was coming.
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Okey-dokey.
Hilary, you're a 23-year-old woman living in your parents' pool house.
You haven't had a job in over two months.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I'm not pregnant.
Honey Sweetheart I don't want to be too hard on you.
The hell I don't.
Get a job.
Why don't you just beat me with a wire hanger?
Yo, yo, my posse, check it out.
In less than five minutes, yours truly is going to be on the 6:00 news.
And without handcuffs.
What, they use the old choke hold?
This I got to see.
No, no, it was a peaceful protest.
Would even made Gandhi proud.
You know, except we went out for burgers afterwards.
Well, what were you protesting, Will?
Well, you know, the city wants to tear down the rec center on Pico so a couple of us got together, started a petition.
You know, we get enough signatures, we might be able to save it.
So, when did you become so socially conscious?
Well, you know, I play ball down there, and plus it's good for the community.
And there's also this girl down there on the swim team.
She teaching me the breaststroke.
Come on, you guys, the news is starting.
- Tear it down.
- Save the rec.
- Save the rec.
- Tear it down.
/'m standing outside the LA Recreationa/ Center on Pico Bou/evard.
The peop/e you see behind me a// have one thing in common.
Yeah, polyester.
Except for that guy holding the microphone.
He's kind of cute.
I wonder why I've never seen him before.
Probably 'cause this is the news and he's never been on Studs.
Doesn't matter.
He wouldn't be interested in me anyway.
I have no job.
I have no self-esteem.
- I'm nobody.
- Shut up!
We're trying to hear the TV.
This p/ace is a magnet for urban decay.
/'ve been mugged here twice.
/ say tear the sucker down.
Of course, not everyone fe/t the same way.
Here we go, here we go.
/'m for the rec center because that's where / do most of my rec centering.
And when /'m not down with R-E-C, /'m down with R-A-P.
When / got home /ate from the grocery store Mama said, "Lock him out"!
Now / know why Pops had to go 'Cause Mama is way whacked out!
Mama is way whacked out!
Good /uck, homey.
I don't believe that mess.
You know, it's the same thing every time they interview a black person on TV.
They either singing or dancing.
And they got curlers in their head or out of activator.
You know, Will, that really makes you think.
What's activator?
Come on, man, you saw that story.
I mean, that ain't fair!
Life isn't fair, Will.
I mean, was it fair when Bambi's mother died?
Or is it fair that the coyote still can't catch the roadrunner?
Or how about Roger Rabbit?
How did he get a babe like that?
You know, Carlton, you're right.
Life isn't fair.
Because if it was, then your legs wouldn't be shorter than your arms.
Hey, good morning.
Hi, Carla, any calls?
Just another Ionely white woman wanting to sleep with you.
Carla, that is very unprofessional.
- Besides, how do you know she's white?
- She's my mother.
Oh, forget it, Will.
Trevor's not gonna be interested in some unemployed freeloader.
Now, come on, Hil, look, your job is not your identity.
I mean, you got a lot of other things going for you.
- Like what?
- Well, like the fact that you're Well, well, you know that you're y our hat always matches your shoes.
Talk about missing the obvious.
Thanks, Will.
Excuse me, miss last night this station did the crazy hatchet job on the rec center and I want to talk to somebody about it right now.
That would be our producer, Howard, but he doesn't talk to the viewing public.
It causes his ulcer to bleed.
Howard, there's someone here to see you.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- Oh, God.
- What?
There's Trevor.
Oops!
I dropped my wallet.
Could you get that for me, please?
Look, if your horny friend wants to meet Trevor, he's down the hall to the right.
But you'll have to fight my mother for him.
Okay.
- Somebody here to see me, Carla?
- An angry viewer.
I'm going to lunch.
See you tomorrow.
Look, kid, I've got an emergency here.
I've got to find a new weather man.
Whoa, look, I just need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down.
Ethnic is definitely a way to go.
Yo, come on, man, look, this ain't about color.
Look, I ain't just some young rapper trying to get on TV, man.
Great legs.
Thanks a lot, man.
Hey, but, look, I ain't dancing either.
- Come on, this is serious.
- Look, kid, I gotta run.
All right, look, I'll dance, just no tap, all right?
Maybe Mike here can help you.
Look.
Mike, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
I need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down.
Can you help me?
I'm 60 and I'm pushing a mail cart.
Do I look like I can help you?
Excuse me.
I'm Howard, the producer of News and Action.
- Could you do that again?
- Do what?
Stand like you were before on your toes.
Only this time I'd like you to point.
Incredible!
How would you like to be a weather girl?
I don't know the first thing about weather.
Sure you do.
- What happens when it rains?
- You send Geoffrey out to get the car.
Hey, yo, man.
Look, I don't appreciate being played off like this, right?
This is 'cause I'm black, right?
That's why you won't put me on the air.
Look, I'm on to your little scheme and that one black anchor you got just ain't gonna cut it.
That's why I'm making her our new weather girl.
I love a screamer.
Oh, Will, this is all thanks to you.
I owe you big time.
No, Hil, this is great.
Now you can put me on the air.
Forget it.
What experience do you have?
It's 'cause I'm black.
That's what the thing is.
Hey, yo, I don't believe this.
The news station won't let me come on to talk about the petition.
Will, Will, Will.
Haven't you learned anything living with me the past two years?
What, you mean other than the words to Mandy?
I'm talking about The Art of Negotiation and I'll be glad to share my wisdom with you.
No, no, no.
Last time you shared something with me I was on antibiotics for two weeks.
- Hi, boys.
- Hey, what's going on, Uncle Phil?
So, Will.
Have any luck down at the news station?
No, Uncle Phil.
It was kind of weird, too.
It was like no matter how much sense I was making, the dude wouldn't listen.
I don't know, it was almost like a discrimination type thing or something.
I don't know.
Boy, I wish I knew a lawyer.
What are you talking about?
You know me.
- You?
- Yeah.
No, Uncle Phil, I mean, you're this big-time lawyer and everything.
I mean, you ain't got time to help us little guys fight the system.
I mean, now, you did back in the day though.
You was the man back then.
But, you know, now Don't even worry about it, Uncle Phil.
It's all right.
We sha// overcome Wait a minute, Will, who'd you meet with down there at the station?
Some producer named Howard, Uncle Phil.
Well, I think it's time you and I pay Howard another visit.
- Yes, sir, it is.
- Nobody pushes my nephew around - and gets away with it.
- No, sir, they do not.
I will slap that place with so many class-action suits they won't know what hit them.
- We// - Come on!
Hi, everyone.
Did Will tell you the good news?
- What?
- I got a job.
- Hallelujah!
- Praise Jesus, let's go, Uncle Phil.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
Now, it's not every day that my little baby gets a job.
- So, what will you be doing?
- Okay, try to guess.
A limo will pick me up and take me home.
I'll make lots of money, and I'll only have to work an hour a day.
Oh, my God!
She's gonna be a hooker!
No, you idiot.
I'm gonna be a weather girl.
That is so great.
Get going, let's go, Uncle Phil.
What a surprise!
You know, I didn't even know you were up for the job.
Well, I wasn't.
It's all thanks to Will.
Unlike you who kicked me when I was down Will took me by the hand and led me to the news station to meet Trevor Collins.
And, while I was there this guy, Howard, offered me the job.
I love Howard.
Whoa, whoa, Uncle Phil, come on, remember Howard's the enemy.
Shut up, Will.
Howard's a god.
He performed a miracle.
Hilary's working.
With any luck, she'll be off my property before I'm dead.
So, sweetheart, tell me about this Howard.
Does he like cashmere?
My man, Carlton.
What's up with this negotiating thing, man?
Hop on one foot and say, "Carlton is king".
You know, I got a better idea.
How about I squeeze your neck till your head pops off?
See, you're negotiating already.
You guys are the greatest.
Thanks for making sure I got here okay.
Come on, Hil, that's what family's for.
And besides, we never would have gotten past security without you.
- I don't understand.
- We were counting on that.
Hi, Carla, any calls?
All right, come on, man, let's break.
I'm gonna demand to get on the air.
Will, has all that hot sauce finally gone to your brain?
Look, there's a right way to negotiate and a wrong way.
Observe the right way.
Hi, I'm here to see Howard.
- Your name?
- Bryant.
Bryant Gumbel.
And I'm Patti LaBelle.
Beat it.
Look, Patti, you seem like a no-nonsense kind of slimmy, right?
So, I'm gonna give it to you straight.
Will, you gotta lie to get what you want.
Didn't you watch the Republican convention?
Carlton, don't make me come down there.
Look, it's like this.
I need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down and I don't care if I gotta force my way on the set to get it.
Let me get this straight.
You want to storm the set, disrupt a live newscast and jeopardize the credibility of this station.
- Yes.
- Will you be needing wardrobe?
Five minutes to air, everybody.
Oh, Hilary, before you go on I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Dan Rather.
Wet your lips.
Thank you.
- So, how do you like the jacket?
- Incredible.
Makes me look really buffed.
It sure does.
Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, I'm your new weather girl.
Well, welcome aboard.
You know the last person who had your job was really special to me.
I'm gonna miss Lou.
- I thought his name was Jack.
- Whatever.
Wow!
I know.
Hi, I'm Trevor Collins and these are my real teeth.
- Wow!
- I know.
My God, you have incredible eyes.
- Really?
- Yes, I can see myself in them.
Don't blink.
And to conclude our story on the homeless I'd like to leave you with something a young girl named Dorothy once said "There's no place like home, Auntie Em "there's no place like home".
Trevor.
Well, on a brighter note, Jack, our weather man, died.
So, it is now with great pleasure that I introduce the newest addition to the News and Action team, Hilary Banks.
- How's it looking for tonight?
- Very promising.
Here in Southern California, we're experiencing a warm front with increasing humidity.
That's right, girls, it's a frizzy-hair day.
Looking at the nation, oh Looking at the nation, there's a cold front blowing in from the Atlantic with a high probability of rain in the Midwest.
The South, however, will enjoy pleasant and sunny weather.
So, if you're planning on going to the beaches, remember you can help keep America beautiful with two simple words Jenny Craig.
Now, let's go look at our big board for the local weather for the week.
Will!
That's right, Will Smith here on community feedback.
Today's topic is the petition to save the Los Angeles Rec Center.
See, the rec center for a lot of us is, you know, it's like a home away from home.
The people down there, they understand us and they help keep us out of trouble.
Just hand me the mike and we'll pretend this never happened.
Oh, my God, can we get a close-up?
I am so choked up at this moment.
Howard, the producer, has just asked me if he can sign the petition live on the air.
- What?
- And, of course, the answer is yes.
Talk about a leader.
Talk about a man that's here to support his community.
Thank you, Howard.
Now for those of you that want to follow in Howard's footsteps there's still time.
You can get down to the LA Rec Center and sign a petition and show our kids that we really care.
Thank you.
Well, as I can see, my time has run out.
Trevor.
No wonder they love me, man.
Well, thank you for that commentary and please remember to put back my blazer.
Hilary, thank you for that delightful forecast.
We will certainly be looking forward to seeing more of your warm front.
I mean, the warm front.
Well, from all of us here on News and Action good night and Godspeed.
- Hi, Will.
- Hey, what's going on, Hil?
Why aren't you in bed?
Uncle Phil saw the news and he threatened to kill me in my sleep.
That's nice.
- With a big butcher knife.
- Good for you.
- Hilary, your hair's on fire.
- Thanks.
You know, Will, life doesn't get any better than this.
I mean, I have a great job, I met a great guy and I have the thinnest ankles of any girl I know.
So, you mean you're not mad at me for messing up your first day?
Of course not.
I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have got the job in the first place.
Thanks a lot, Hil.
I'm proud of you.
You know, I'm kind of proud of myself.
For the first time I feel like I know what it means to be an independent woman.
I think I'm gonna go back to my little pool house and toast myself with a glass of champagne.
- Good night, Hil.
- Good night, Will.
- Good night, Trevor.
- Good night and Godspeed.
Well, for all of us here at News and Action good night and Godspeed.
Another one in the can.
- Yes, you're in awe of me, aren't you?
- I am.
- You're the best.
- I'm a god.
You're very good.
- Exce/ente.
- Yes.
Cut.
Pretty good.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Well, how do I look?
Whoa, man.
You know that model in all them Hugo Boss ads?
- Yeah.
- You don't look nothing like him.
You're just jealous because the love of my life has returned.
In Cindy, I have found the woman I'd share the rest of my life with.
You've never even found a woman you'd share a burrito with.
Earth to Carlton, but Cindy dumped you, man.
She didn't dump me, Will.
She was just working through a fear of intimacy caused by an overpowering father and a narcissistic mother.
Sure it wasn't your breath?
Oh, look, hors d'oeuvres.
Isn't it great to be rich?
Hands off.
They're for Cindy.
Cindy?
Isn't she the one who dumped you?
Carlton, why are you wearing a suit?
Is Daddy bringing home white people?
- No.
Cindy's coming over.
- Cindy?
I thought she dumped you.
Okay, okay, she dumped me but now that she's back, I'm not gonna let her go.
I'm gonna prove to her that I'm ready for an adult, mature relationship.
Door!
Door!
Door!
All right, don't wet yourself.
I'll get it.
God, I'm a wreck.
- Carlton.
- Cindy.
I have something that belongs to you.
Say hello to Daddy.
Excuse me.
G, hurry up with that water, man.
That's it.
Carlton, wake up.
Now, come on, man.
Congratulations, man.
He's a boy.
Carlton, come on, man.
Carlton, a father?
He won't even let Ken and Barbie sleep in the same shoebox.
You and Cindy?
I mean, come on.
Hey, the longest relationship Carlton ever had was with last year's Ebony swimsuit issue.
This isn't a joke.
I mean, doesn't he look just like Carlton?
Well, it looks like they wear the same size.
- Can I hold him?
- Yeah, here you are.
Oh, he is so cute.
Oh!
Get this drool machine away from me.
Hey, can I?
Thank you.
What up, dude?
Boy, when Mom and Dad see this, somebody's gonna swing.
Well, I can assure you, it won't be me.
This time, the butler didn't do it hasn't done it and I'd be surprised if he even remembered how to do it.
Philip, I am never wearing a bathing suit again, as long as I live.
Now, honey, I'm sure the pool man didn't really mistake you for me.
He called me Mr. Banks.
That's still no reason to hold his head underwater, sweetheart.
- I'll get you some antacid for that.
- No, don't.
That wasn't me.
Cindy.
Mr. And Mrs. Banks.
Hi, sweetheart.
How long has it been?
Well, I'd take a shot in the dark and say around nine months.
Whose is that?
He's mine.
Oh, my goodness.
He's adorable.
Come here, sweetheart.
Oh, my.
What's his name?
Carlton.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me your father's first name is Carlton.
Sorry, wrong answer.
Now, for those of you just tuning in to Name That Father this little bundle of joy belongs to a young man who's seen Litt/e Mermaid eight times.
No.
Carlton are you the father?
Excuse me.
Carlton.
Carlton.
- Carlton!
- Vivian.
Honey, honey.
Back off, Philip.
I am having a mother-son moment.
- Carlton, how could you do this to us?
- Vivian, step away from the boy.
Now, look, we're going to have to talk about this in private.
Not you, stupid.
Sit your butt down.
Hey, I'll take care of this, Uncle Phil.
Okay, that's it.
Move it along, party's over.
Nothing to see here.
Come on.
Pep it up, little grey man.
Man, I thought they'd never leave.
- Will.
- Phil.
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna Look, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
Sweetheart, you show up here with a baby that you say is my son's and you didn't mean to cause any trouble.
Where do you think you are, Fantasy /s/and?
Watch out how you talk to the mother of my son.
Sir.
Carlton, do you realize what you're saying?
He is Carlton's baby.
I'll believe that when I see a blood test.
It's the truth, whether you want to believe it or not.
I love Carlton.
Really?
Yes.
And I'll tell you something else.
Carlton is the most incredible lover I have ever had.
Oh, God.
I mean, he's so in tune with my needs.
It was amazing, and endless, and magnificent.
I think I saw God.
The windows.
I'm sorry.
- I fell.
- We didn't mean to.
I fell.
I fell.
Carlton, I am so disappointed in you.
I mean, why didn't you come to us first?
Honey, we could have counseled you.
Or at least had you neutered.
Cindy, honey, I don't understand.
If you knew this was Carlton's son, why did you leave?
Because I knew that a baby could ruin his life but I did feel that he deserved to see his son and that's why I came.
Thank you for stopping by.
Bye.
Philip.
Cindy, honey, I think we need to talk to your parents about this.
That won't do any good.
They don't want to have anything to do with me.
They threw you out?
Where are you going to stay?
Mommy?
- Well, you could stay with us.
- No!
At least, until after the blood test.
- I couldn't impose.
- Oh, we understand.
You know, I hear Ramada Inn has a wonderful pool.
Cindy, please stay.
We want you to, okay?
Carlton will show you to the guest room and there's no need to wake the baby.
You know it's like the Rodney King videotape, you know?
I just keep seeing it over, and over, and over again.
And I ask myself, where did I fail him, you know?
Where did we go wrong?
Hey, Mom, guess who?
No, it's Will.
Will Smith.
Hey, yo, Mom, check it out.
It is some drama cutting loose out here.
No, I'm not in trouble, but, no, check it out.
Somebody we know is a grandma.
No, not you, Mom.
Mom.
No, Mom.
Mom, stop crying.
Stop crying.
Mom, no, it's not me.
It's Carlton is the father.
Stop laughing, Mom.
Yeah, that will be a large pepperoni with extra cheese.
Right.
I love you.
That makes them bring it faster.
Give me the phone, Will.
This time Cindy's parents are going to talk to me.
Philip, honey, just be calm.
Now, I'm sure they're lovely people.
Just because they let their daughter run wild and take advantage of our only son and flush his life down the toilet - Give me the damn phone, Philip.
- Vivian!
Vivian, sweetheart, I'll handle it.
Yes, hello.
Yeah, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
What kind of lowlifes are you throwing a minor out onto the street and endangering a helpless infant?
Well, I'm going to do everything I can to see you behind bars.
And what do you have to say for yourself?
So when will your mommy and daddy be home?
Here we come, ready or not.
Super, huh?
Look, matching hats.
I never knew having a family could be so neat.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
All right, whoa.
I'd like to take this opportunity to bring it to everyone's attention that Uncle Phil's head is about to explode and, for once, it ain't my fault.
Well, I think it's time for little Carlton's nap.
Yeah, it smells like you needs to be changed, too.
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Miss you, too.
- Isn't she something?
- Yeah, she sure is and Monday, after the blood test proves the baby's not yours she'll be out of here on the first thing smoking.
Dad, the baby's mine.
Carlton, honey, suppose the baby is yours.
Now, being a teenage parent is a very big responsibility, honey and you have already proven yourself irresponsible otherwise, you wouldn't be in this situation.
How are you going to feed this baby?
Where are you going to live?
How are you going to educate it?
Wait a minute.
You mean, you're not going to take care of us?
- Hold me back, Philip.
- Carlton, get out.
Get out, now.
Go.
Hey, I got him, but take another step, and I'll fill you full of potassium.
Master William, might I see you for a moment?
Yeah, sure.
What's up, G?
Well, it's such a beautiful night.
I thought you might like to see the moon.
Go easy on the poor little pinhead.
Are you climbing down Rapunzel's extensions?
I don't want Mom and Dad to know.
- To know what?
- Cindy and I are driving to Lompoc.
No, Carlton, nobody drives to Lompoc.
You drive through Lompoc.
No, but there's a chapel.
We're eloping.
- What?
- No, Will, I don't want to hear it.
I'm tired of everyone telling me what to do.
I love Cindy, and I've made up my mind.
All right, man, fine.
Look, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
What?
I said, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
If you want to marry Cindy, go ahead.
Just do me a favor.
Sleep on it tonight.
In the morning, if you feel the same way then, whatever you want to do.
- Deal?
- Deal.
My man.
Oh, give me your car keys.
You know, Will, I gave you my word.
I'd think that'd be enough.
Yeah, you lucky I ain't going to do you like Kunta Kinte and chop off your foot.
- Your cheesecake, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey, would you get Carlton, please?
- Certainly, sir.
Thank you.
Run, Geoffrey.
Fetch, Geoffrey.
Perhaps you'd like me to catch a Frisbee in my teeth?
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, freeze!
Just where have you been?
- To the refrigerator.
- At this hour?
It's 8:00.
Philip, look at us.
We are really overreacting.
This is Will.
There's no such thing as overreacting.
- Frisk him.
- Whoa.
Look, Adolph, Eva, why don't you all relax for a second.
Geoffrey, where's Carlton?
I'm sorry, sir, but he's not in his room but the trip wasn't a total loss.
I found $1.25 under his bed.
Who knew Christmas would come twice this year?
Geoffrey, did you check Cindy's room?
The girl hasn't a penny to her name.
Will, where's Carlton?
I don't know, Uncle Phil.
Did you check the cracks in the couch?
Will, you know something?
Come on, Uncle Phil does this look like the face of a dude that knows something?
He's got a point there, Vivian.
Well, maybe we should call Carlton's friends.
That's a good idea.
I'll call one, you call the other.
Number 52.
Well, we're next, my little bride-to-be.
Carlton I hope you don't feel like I pressured you into this.
I mean, you are glad we're getting married, right?
Glad?
Cindy, I've been in love with you ever since the third grade.
I mean, I used to go to sleep at night and dream about the day we'd be married.
- Do you really mean that, Carlton?
- Yes.
We're going to have such a wonderful life.
I mean, we'll have to live in a trailer at first but I'll get a job during the days, and I'll work nights, too as soon as I lick that pesky fear of the dark thing.
Well, you know, Carlton, I was thinking that I would get a job, too.
Don't worry about it.
No wife of mine is going to have to work.
I mean, you can stay home and take care of the kids.
Exactly how many kids?
Well, you know what they say, eight is enough.
Look, Carlton, I need to - Would you watch the baby for a minute?
- Sure.
Please, sweetie, please don't cry.
Here comes little Mr. Ducky.
Doesn't he quack you up?
Wow!
If I could pass like that, they wouldn't make me play on the girl's team.
They'll throw us out.
That's my boy.
"And if there's anyone here "who feels this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony "let them speak now or forever hold their peace".
Stop, man, don't do it!
You don't even know if the baby is yours!
- How did you know I'm having a baby?
- What?
You having a baby?
Yo, hey, look, my fault.
You all, see, my cousin was supposed Hey, congratulations, man.
So you're having his baby?
What a wonderful way to say how much I love you, huh?
You're too late, Will.
Oh, man, you did it?
Tell me you didn't do it.
God, please tell me you didn't marry her.
I didn't marry her.
Yes.
You the man.
She left me.
I got the feeling she didn't want to live with me.
- What made you think that?
- She said she didn't want to live with me.
Oh, man, I mean, she can't just walk out on you like that.
- What if the kid is yours?
- He's not.
Carlton, come on, just because the baby is cute doesn't mean you're not the father.
I never slept with her.
Look, since we're in a church, I feel the need to confess something.
Please don't laugh.
This is really hard for me to say.
I'm a y ou a German?
No.
I'm a virgin.
What?
I'm a virgin!
It's nice to know somebody still is.
Hey, look, Carlton, man, I mean, I didn't know.
I mean, hey, don't feel bad though.
I mean, a lot of guys are you know, Germans.
Will, I feel so unused.
I mean, promise me you won't tell anyone.
Hey, Carlton, come on, man, you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.
I mean, everybody talks about how much pressure there is on girls to have sex.
I mean, there's pressure on us, too.
That's why we lie about it.
You lie about it?
You mean you're a virgin, too?
Keep your voice down, man.
I ain't no virgin!
Sorry.
Hey, look, man, when it comes to me and the honeys, I just say no way.
Yucky.
Will, I'm really gonna miss her.
- Where did she go?
- Back to her parents.
When she called and told them she was going to marry me they came and got her.
Hey, look, Carlton, man, they're wrong about you.
You're a great guy, man.
Hey, look, come on.
Let's go home, so you can get in trouble.
And don't worry about it, man.
I mean one day the right girl's going to come along and, I mean, you won't be a German forever, you know?
Good, 'cause I'm really looking forward to losing my accent.
Hey, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
Now, who do you think you are?
What kind of lowlifes are you people to throw a helpless minor out onto the street with a helpless infant?
I'll call you back.
Who are you people, to talk to my uncle like that - with a helpless infant - Here we go.
and helpless actors?
- Okay.
- With a// these he/p/ess peop/e.
- Okay, here.
This is it.
Wi// somebody p/ease he/p us?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hi, Will.
- Hey, how're you doing, Lindsey?
- Are you going to the Lakers game?
I wish.
I don't have no tickets.
Isn't that a coincidence?
Here I am with two tickets to the Lakers game, and no one to go with.
You enjoy yourself tonight, all right?
Too bad you can't make it.
The seats are center court.
We can go in my dad's limo and I have passes to the after-game party - but, yeah, well.
- Wait, wait.
Whoa.
I mean, hey.
Who am I to be so selfish?
What do you say you pick me up around 8:00?
Just for tonight, how about you let your buns down?
Geoffrey, you look great today.
Have you done something different with your hair?
Yes.
I stopped pulling it out.
What are you selling?
Okay, I'm hawking candy bars.
They're only $5.
Marvelous.
With what I'm paid I should be able to afford one by the end of the day.
You poor, pathetic gigolo.
How could any self-respecting man sell himself so cheap?
Like I don't hear enough of that from my mother.
- I was talking to Will.
- Of course.
Why would anyone talk to me?
I am but a poor, lowly servant.
Carlton, I'm saying, what's your damage, man?
I mean, Lindsey just can't resist me.
It's just a Laker game, you know?
Hey, besides, you know what they say about guys with big ears?
They can fly?
Vivian, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Philip, I don't see why you don't want to run.
He's probably afraid he'll crack the concrete.
Will, the Allied Political Coalition just asked your uncle - to run for Superior Court Judge.
- Yeah.
Those imbeciles are trying to railroad Judge Robertson off the bench.
I can't believe that.
Judge Robertson?
They had the audacity to try to do that to Judge Robertson?
Who the hell is Judge Robertson?
He was your uncle's mentor and quite a colorful person.
He was a little bit eccentric.
But he taught me the true meaning of the word "justice".
There were times I didn't think I was going to make it through school, but he wouldn't let me quit.
I never would have gotten through law school without him.
What'd he do?
Have the halls widened?
That was a good one.
For your information he taught me not only the spirit, but the letter of the law.
God bless him.
And I consider it an insult for anyone to try to get him out of office.
What do you think, Will?
I think I should have never said nothing about them halls.
So did everybody watch LA's favorite weather girl today?
No.
Well, I was the bright spot, as usual.
I wore my new Versace.
So what's the weather going to be like tomorrow, honey?
What am I, psychic?
Oh, please, let me get it this time.
Hilary.
You look so beautiful today.
I was born beautiful.
What are you selling?
- Okay, I'll give you 10o/o off.
- I'll take two.
Master William, Miss Lindsey to see you.
Miss Lindsey, this is most inappropriate.
I couldn't possibly It's Ben.
Thank you.
- Lindsey, what are you doing here?
- Will.
Honey, that is no way to talk to your guest.
Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Will, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right this way, money Honey.
I'm sorry.
Lindsey, what's up?
I had a great time the other night.
It was magic.
- What did you do?
- I'm talking about us, silly.
I didn't want the night to end.
Well, you know, nights do that sometimes.
Look, Will.
Since we had so much fun the other night, I was wondering if we could spend some time together.
Look, Lindsey.
I mean, I'd really love to.
I mean but I have obligations.
I have commitments.
I have a gold watch.
So how about a little thank-you kiss?
Thank you.
Yo, G, here's the whipped cream you wanted for dinner.
Who said it was for dinner?
Hey, Carlton, what time is it?
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.
I'm only wearing the finest timepiece ever made.
This gold model was handcrafted in Switzerland by the finest of craftsmen.
Keeps time accurate to within three seconds a year.
Love the Casio.
Will, you're nothing more than a trollop a strumpet, a love slave, sans the love.
I'm sorry, Carlton, I couldn't hear you.
My damn watch was just ticking so loud.
You just don't have the fortitude to say no.
Carlton, please.
I mean, I have no choice.
I'm the chosen one.
I mean, take Moses when he was asked to part the Red Sea, did he say, "No, y'all build a dam"?
- Vivian, do I look okay?
- Philip, honey, would you relax?
- We're just having company for dinner.
- It's not just company.
It's Judge Robertson.
He's done so much for me over the years, this is my chance to finally pay him back.
Baby, we're just having pot roast.
- Is the judge here, yet?
- No, honey, not yet.
Good, then I have plenty of time to plant this.
- Hilary, what is that?
- It's a bug.
They gave it to me down at the newsroom.
If I can scoop some dirt on Judge Robertson it could mean a big promotion.
I feel just like Deborah Norville, except I have a job.
Hilary, forget it.
This man is our guest.
Let's just show him the respect he deserves.
Here comes the judge.
Here comes the judge.
Order in the court!
Here comes the judge.
It wouldn't kill you to crack a smile, you know.
Judge Robertson, it's so good to see you, sir.
It's so easy to see you, Philip.
Looks like you haven't stepped on the scales of justice in quite some time.
Did you hear what he said?
He was I'm laughing at something that happened yesterday.
I'm done now.
I remember you.
You're Carlton.
I've known you since you were yea high.
Ain't nothing wrong with his memory.
You got that right.
Forget everything you heard about me.
There may be snow on the roof, but there's still fire in the furnace.
And hello, Vivian.
Philip, your wife gets more youthful with every passing year.
No, excuse me, Judge, no, this is my daughter Hilary.
This is my wife, Vivian.
You've aged.
And what the hell is that you're wearing?
Why don't we come over here?
Dinner is served.
Benson.
I didn't know you were really a butler.
That Judge Robertson's quite a character.
But, Aunt Viv, how come he keep calling you Weezie?
I am sorry, Philip, that man is beyond eccentric.
I asked him to pass the salt.
He told me to go long.
- He was joking, Vivian.
- Philip, he broke a window.
He's a sexist pig.
Hilary, that's not true.
He's pro-choice.
Daddy, he said the only choice a woman should have is with or without the lights on.
See, now that's disgusting.
The lights should be off.
Believe me, son.
The only time a woman should sit on the bench is when she's waiting for a bus.
That's ridiculous.
What if she's serving coleslaw at a picnic?
Point taken.
You have the makings of a fine judge.
So Judge Robertson you were telling us about your most recent decision.
Yes, I had this boy before me recently no preponderance of evidence in either way.
It was a tough call, but in the end, I had to convict.
- How did you decide?
- You see, the prosecutor was a babe so after I decided in her favor, she decided in mine.
Lordy, look at the time.
Judge, let me walk you to your car.
Good, maybe you can remember where I parked.
- Hi, Will.
- Lindsey, how you doing?
Will, I was wondering, if you'd like to go with me to the autumn dance.
Wow.
Look, Lindsey, now I mean, you've been very generous, you know, but I just can't Motorcycle helmet.
But, Lindsey, I mean, I can't take Wow, a motorcycle jacket with Malcolm on it.
I can ride and be righteous at the same time.
- Look, but, Lindsey, I'm sorry - These go to your new Harley-Davidson.
Now what were you gonna say?
Thank you.
Yeah, right, like you wouldn't take it.
- Will.
- Hey.
- How did this get on the patio?
- No, don't worry, Aunt Viv.
I was careful when I drove it through the house.
- I mean where did it come from?
- The Harley factory.
Will, it came from Lindsey, didn't it?
Now, what I want to know is what does she get in return?
All the rides she wants, Aunt Viv.
You are acting like a pimp.
Come on, hold up now.
That is totally unfair, Aunt Viv.
If a man was buying a woman all these gifts nobody would have anything to say about it, right?
Honey, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.
If you don't care for someone, you shouldn't accept gifts.
And it diminishes you every time you accept something from Lindsey.
Now you were not raised that way, boy, and you know it.
Now you know what you need to do, don't you?
Yeah, put out.
I know.
I got to give all this stuff back.
- And?
- And got to be honest with her.
And you know that's right.
If I keep the bike, I'm a pimp.
If I give it back, I'm a damn fool.
Well, pimp it is.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby.
Chocolate?
Forget it, honey.
At $5 a pop, I'm not sharing.
I am so angry.
Okay, here.
You can have a bite.
No, it's about Judge Robertson.
You know, he is sitting up on that bench for all the wrong reasons.
Unless somebody runs against him, he'll be up there forever.
Well, who'd you have in mind?
I don't know.
Somebody dynamic, principled.
Someone who looks good in a black robe.
Jesse Jackson?
No, me.
I know, baby.
I always thought you'd make a fabulous judge.
You sure, baby?
I mean, this could mean big changes for all of us.
I know, but it could also mean big changes for the people in this city.
Maybe for the better.
- I love you, Vivian.
- I love you, too, Philip.
Get your hands off my chocolate, or you're a dead man.
Here's Judge Robertson at that big student anti-war rally, remember?
He was the only professor that had guts enough to go up against the administration.
- I can't believe it.
- Trust me, Hilary.
He was a great man and a hell of a lawyer.
No, I mean, that those women didn't shave under their arms.
Hey, Uncle Phil, hold up.
Who's that skinny, weird dude standing next to you?
That's me.
That's a relief, 'cause I was about to wonder why Uncle Phil was holding that dude's hand.
Look, he'll be here any minute.
How am I going to tell him that I'm running against him?
I mean, how do you tell somebody that used to be your hero that he's become completely incompetent?
Well, big guy, may I suggest using flash cards with really big pictures?
Don't worry, sweetheart, if he's the man that you think he is, he'll understand.
If he's the man I think he is, he'll probably get lost on his way to the bathroom.
Judge Robertson.
- Thanks, Benson.
- For the last time, sir I am not Benson.
Sure, right.
- How are you doing, Judge?
- I'm fine, yeah.
Well, we'll leave you two alone.
Come on, kids.
Good night, nice seeing you again.
Not only has she aged, she has a beer belly.
- That's my wife and she's pregnant.
- Then she should lay off the beer.
Would you take a seat, please?
Judge Robertson, I hear that you're running for reelection and And you want to make a big fat contribution.
Good.
Make the check out to cash.
In fact, why don't you just give me the cash?
Or maybe that ring.
That's good.
No, Carl.
Look, there's something I want to tell you - but I can't seem to find the words.
- Well, where did you have them last?
No.
I'm talking about what's happened to you.
- I'll be frank.
- Okay, and who am I?
No.
Look, what I'm trying to say is that maybe you've served the community long enough and as your friend, I think I should tell you that well, maybe it's time for you to retire.
Me, retire?
Oh, Frank.
Have you lost your mind?
I mean, this is the cushiest job in town.
I get free coffee, validated parking I don't have to wear pants, and besides, there's no one to run against me.
Yes, there is.
- Who?
- Me.
You!
You've got to be kidding.
You don't know the first thing about running for office.
- I taught you about law, not politics.
- Look, the point is I'm going to run against you, and I thought I should tell you face to face.
Oh, yes?
Well, let me tell you something face to face.
I am a very worthy opponent.
And I can see myself in your head.
Benson, my car.
Wow.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
Judge?
Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
- I don't know, don't I live here?
- No, Judge, you don't.
No wonder the garage door opener didn't work.
It took forever to pry it open.
- Look, Judge.
- Juice?
No.
No, thanks.
Look I got some problems, you know, I got to deal with tonight.
- Woman problems.
- Women.
They've been a problem ever since they got the right to vote.
Sit down, son, sit down.
Talk to me, sonny, talk to me.
I've had my share of problems with women.
Actually, Judge, it's this girl at school, Lindsey, right?
She just keep buying me all these fly gifts.
So what's the problem?
- Well, I'm not really attracted to her.
- So what's the problem?
My Aunt Viv told me that, you know it's not right to accept gifts from people that, you know - you're not really attracted to.
- Look, son I remember when I was your age, there was this girl I didn't like her that much she was always buying me gifts, dinner, taking me out.
Heck, she even offered to send me through law school.
- So what did you do?
- What else?
I married her.
- Pie?
- No, thanks, Judge.
So, wait, you're just going to tell me that you got together with this girl, and you had this long, incredible, wonderful life.
I wish I could tell you that.
But the truth is, I dumped her after law school.
I'm sorry, Judge, that's too bad.
No, it's okay.
We split everything down the middle.
I got the money, the house, the car, the boat, and she got to keep the kids.
- Pie?
- No.
No, thanks.
So you're saying that you just kept all this stuff that she gave you, even after y'all broke up?
Damn straight.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law, my boy.
Yo.
Look, Lindsey, I told you I'm busy.
But /'m in the neighborhood, rea//y c/ose.
How close, Lindsey?
Princess Leia!
May the force be with you.
- Will, somebody broke into your garage.
- Quick, call the police.
Lindsey, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, what are you doing here?
- As if I didn't know, right?
- It's over, Will.
- See what I'm saying?
It's what?
- Over.
- But why?
- Why ask why?
Look at her.
I'm not attracted to you, Will.
- Yeah.
Yes, you are.
- No.
No, I'm not.
- I've never been attracted to you.
- Well Then why did you buy me all this stuff?
Well, you're captain of the basketball team you're popular, and being seen with you at the autumn dance made me popular, too.
But now your job is done.
That woman is ruthless.
You ever think about going into politics?
- Yeah.
As a matter of fact, l - Whoa.
I'm saying, Lindsey, I mean, what about me as a person?
What about the way that my cheeks dimple when I smile?
And what color are my eyes?
Look at you all quiet.
You don't even know.
Who cares?
Who cares?
I feel so used, so cheap.
You certainly weren't cheap.
Cost me a fortune.
I want my stuff back.
Now.
- Wait.
But - Now!
You take this ring back, 'cause my mother don't scream at me like that.
Watch back, and you can take this jacket back.
Nice meeting you, young lady.
Be sure to rock the vote.
Good night.
You know, Judge I never thought saying goodbye would be so hard.
I really loved that watch.
He was a little eccentric.
But, he traught Taught me that.
And soon as I say this Let's do it again.
- He traught you?
- Yeah, he traught me.
- What'd he traught you?
- He traught me how to Oops.
- And /et's go do this again.
- Damn.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
What's up, Prince?
Me and Carlton just checking out these college brochures.
I've already set my sights on Princeton.
It has a balanced curriculum with the largest repository of classical literature.
Yeah, well, I got my sights set on this school with the largest repository of girls with the big old butts.
Oh, yeah!
Which reminds me, I brought your CD player back.
See, Jazz, now this is not my CD player, see 'cause my CD player has the wires on the inside.
I'm sorry, man.
How can I make it up to you?
Jazz, how about paying for it?
Why would I want to buy a broken CD player?
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Judge.
- Now, Will, please.
I haven't even announced that I'm running.
I don't think you'd have to announce it, Mr. Banks.
If you ran, we'd hear you coming.
I'm running for Superior Court Judge.
He still could use the exercise.
Will, Carlton I want you guys to be on your best behavior tomorrow and look presentable.
It's navy-blue jacket, gray slacks, power tie.
Whoa, Uncle Phil, you sure you wouldn't want Carlton to wear Aunt Viv's apron?
No.
Oh, Jazz, I need you to bring over my blue jacket.
Don't worry, man, I'll have it back to you first thing tomorrow morning.
You won't even be able to tell I wore it.
Jazz, what did you do to my jacket?
You told me to get it cleaned.
So I washed it.
I don't believe you, man, first my CD player, now this.
- You make a doorknob look smart, man.
- No need to get testy.
At least I got out all the A.1.
sauce.
Whoa, hold up.
Underdog's on.
Excuse me, but I'm watching the Eagles.
Well, excuse me but you once preferred the whimsy of a y ogi and a Boo Boo.
Will, I hardly know you.
Will, put on your jacket.
We're leaving for the press luncheon in 10 minutes.
Hey, have you been undressing my Teddy Ruxpin again?
- Vivian, you look so sexy.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
Now go upstairs and change.
What, don't you want to project the right image?
Hey, I'm happy that this fits over my belly.
- Which reminds me, I'm hungry.
- Viv Daddy?
I am a young adult, and I have my rights.
If you force me to wear this, I'II I'll hold my breath until my face turns blue.
Ashley, you're 13 years old, you'll do what I say.
- But that's not fair.
- Call a cop.
Mommy!
Well, I'm ready.
I've been waiting all my life to hear you say that.
I meant, I'm ready for the press conference.
You know, sometimes I lose sight of why I want to be a judge.
Then you open your mouth, and it all comes flooding back.
Thank you.
See, Will, I inspire him.
No, no, not yet.
Not now, Jazz.
Oh, no!
No, you're on the one-yard line!
Fumble?
Herschel, pick it up!
Well, it's painfully obvious that my presence is no longer required.
Here, Carlton.
Eventually, you'll grow into it.
Excuse me, sir, but how's your day been going so far?
- Well, wonderful, Geoffrey, thank you.
- Well, down the toilet it goes.
Judge Robertson, what are you doing here, sir?
Philip, it's good to see you again, my boy.
How long has it been: 10, 15 years?
- We just had dinner a few weeks ago, sir.
- We did?
Did I leave here with my pants on?
Yes.
Oh, thank God.
But that means you must throw a lousy party.
But enough about you, Philip.
Look, Philip, you got to help me.
You're the only one I can trust.
I just heard that they found someone to run against me.
Judge, we discussed that over dinner.
I'm running against you.
What?
How dare you!
Get out of my house!
Out!
Lionel, show him the door.
Go, go, go, touchdown!
Will, Will.
Put that thing away.
- Uncle Phil, they just tied it up.
- I don't care.
- Mr. Banks.
- Yes.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
And welcome to this afternoon's press conference.
It is my pleasure to introduce to you Mr. Philip Banks.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the press and thank you very much for coming.
I'd like to take this opportunity to formally announce my candidacy for the office of Superior Court Judge.
Thank you.
I plan on restoring faith in the judicial system.
And I ask you: Do you really want six more years of the same tired plea-bargaining?
Yes, yes!
What?
Judge Robertson has been in office six straight terms how do you intend to break that streak?
By focusing on the issues and not personality.
Once the voters see where I stand, I'm sure I'll win this election.
You idiot, you don't even deserve to sit on the bench.
What?
Judge Robertson.
- I didn't know he had kids.
- He doesn't.
And that's not his wife.
And am I crazy or does he look 10 years younger?
That's unbelievable.
Is that brisket I smell?
- Lovely family.
- Thank you.
- Who are they?
- Rented.
Judge Robertson, how does it feel to be running against your own student?
Philip Banks is a gentleman and one of the smartest students I ever had.
A man who would bring honor to the bench.
Don't get me wrong, I want the job.
But I can't think of another person that I would mind losing to but this man here.
I love you, my son.
What a guy.
Mr. Banks, what's your response?
Excuse me.
Mr. Banks, we're looking for your nephew, a William Smith.
Oh, my God.
It's over, it's all over.
Are you Will Smith?
No, Rahjim Shabaz, Muslim activist.
Sa/aam a/aikum.
Will, what's wrong?
You're under arrest, Shabaz.
Sit down, Smith.
Oh, okay, it's like that, right?
All right.
It's cool.
I'm gonna sit down.
All right, I'm sitting down right here.
And you think that just 'cause you got that badge and all your tough cop friends walking around and your cute little walkie-talkie that you can talk to folks any old way you want to do it.
Well, I tell you right now, if you ain't have all that stuff we'd be squawking a different language up in here right now.
What are you trying to say?
I think I made myself real clear when I said what I just said.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you did.
Mr. Officer, your stuff fell off.
Hip-hop cop.
Blue looks nice on you, too.
Match that big blue vein throbbing in your neck right now.
I'm Philip Banks, the boy's attorney.
I'd like to speak to my nephew alone, please.
What's up now, tough guy?
- No problem, sir.
- That's right.
- I guess we told him, right, Uncle Phil?
- Sit down.
Will, how could you get $2,000 worth of parking tickets when I told you to get rid of that car months ago?
Actually, I did get rid of it.
See, I gave it to a friend.
Look, I swear to you, Uncle Phil there ain't no way I got them parking tickets.
Look at the printout.
Huh?
"Snuffy's Chicken Shack, Big Ben's Barbeque "Alice's All Nude Review".
What do you call this?
One hell of a Friday night.
Can I see that, Uncle Phil?
Wait a minute, Uncle Phil, these are all Jazz's hangouts.
He must have gotten all these parking tickets.
I'm serious.
I told him I'd kill him.
How could he go to Alice's All Nude Review without me?
Well, hello, Philip, my boy.
Welcome to City Hall.
Thank you.
Will, wait in the car and don't even touch the steering wheel.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Judge.
Judge.
Judge, check it out.
Look, brother ran into a little misfortune.
Right?
I got like $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
I was just wondering, I don't know, maybe you might be able to do a I thought he was selling condoms.
I apologize for my nephew, Judge.
And I hope this little incident didn't cause any undue embarrassment.
I mean - the press is going to have a field day.
- Well, I certainly hope so.
This is just the beginning.
You know, I was browsing through the police files and bingo, up pops your nephew's name.
Parking tickets up the ying-yang.
So I busted his bony butt.
Pretty good, huh?
- Excuse me?
- Oh, wake up, knucklehead.
You're in the big leagues now.
I may be old, I may be senile and I haven't been able to find my car for the past half hour but I can beat your butt in a political campaign any day.
You're dead meat, Tiny.
I always knew Will would be the downfall of this family.
But no one ever listens to me.
What, honey?
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
I can't believe this.
I mean, Will being arrested means we're all going to be investigated.
I mean, this is how they knocked off Imelda Marcos.
I'll just die if they touch my shoes.
I'd die if you made your own bed.
Get off me, man, just get off me.
Thank you, thank you.
Will.
I'm so glad you're home.
Carlton said you were probably doing 5 to 10 by now.
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Aunt Viv.
- Well, good, now I can break your legs.
- Vivian, Vivian, I'll handle this.
Now we have to make a statement for the press.
So put on an apron, grab the cookie jar.
Forget it.
And I ate all the cookies before lunch.
Okay, okay, then we'll have to grab the cutest kid.
Ashley, you'll do.
Come on, smile, sweetheart.
Let's go, Vivian, come on.
Okay.
Are you ready to talk to us now?
Man, this has been the worst day of my life.
And as soon as I see Jazz, I'm going to make it the worst day of his.
Will, you seem embittered.
Jail will do that to a man.
Now that you've done hard time, a book may be in order.
Criminals sell.
I can sell criminals.
You're a criminal.
Really?
And you're too short to ride the teacup ride at Disneyland.
What's up, Will?
Man, what's with all the reporters?
I ain't seen no chalk outlines or nothing.
That's 'cause I didn't murder you yet.
What's got your BVDs in a bunch?
Well, for starters, you ruined the most important day in my uncle's life.
Haagen-Dazs opened in Bel-Air?
Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
And you didn't even tell me.
You're right, I should have told you.
Will, I got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
- What do you plan to do about that, Jazz?
- I'll take care of it, man.
I promise.
Can I borrow $2,000?
This is not a joke, man.
I trusted you, Jazz.
I trusted you, and you got me tossed into jail.
Friends don't do that to each other, man.
I mean, friends are supposed to be there for each other.
Friends aren't supposed to set you up to take a fall.
And most importantly, friends are supposed to be honest with each other.
And you obviously don't fit that mold.
So from this point on, you can consider our friendship over.
You're no longer welcome in this house.
And I'd appreciate it if you just got the hell out of my crib.
Ain't you going to even bother to throw me out?
You're not worth it, man.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Will.
Hey, hey G, you want to go watch some Underdog?
Why, do I look like a moron?
Banks residence.
G, look, if that's Jazz, tell him I do not want to talk to him.
It's for me.
It's my accountant.
So what are you wearing?
Hey, Carlton, man, how about we shoot down to The Wing King, man get a big bucket of ribs?
Do I look like Jimmie Walker?
Forget you then, man.
Hey, hey, hey, Ashley.
I just got the new video boxing.
Come on, you want to play?
Sorry, homey, homework.
Hey, Hil, you want to No, Will, I don't want ribs, I don't want to wax your ride and I don't even know what a Chumpy is.
Okay.
All right.
It's like that, right?
It's like that.
Y'all going to flee me like that, right?
My suggestion to you, my despondent, desperate, ne'er-do-well cousin is to make amends with your partner in delinquency.
What?
Call him, Will.
I'm sure Jazz is sorry.
Why should I call him after what he did to me?
You know, forget it.
I don't need him.
I don't need you.
I don't need nobody.
I just want to get up to my room, Uncle Phil.
I don't want no trouble.
It's all right, Will, I'm not mad anymore.
- Oh, my God, Philip, look at this.
- What?
It's all in the paper.
They got a picture of me throwing a reporter in the pool.
What a wonderful way to start my campaign.
My nephew gets arrested.
My wife looks like y ou look wonderful, sweetheart.
I don't know.
Actually, Aunt Viv, you got a, kind of a homicidal, sumo-wrestler thing going.
Oh, but you working it, girl.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What are you doing here?
I was out for my morning constitutional and I must have walked farther than I thought.
But since I'm here, bean pie for all.
You know, just my way of saying y ou know.
- Oh, that's very nice, Jazz.
- Thank you, Jazz.
I guess you two want to be alone.
I don't get it, Philip, why did he give us a bean pie?
What am I, Freud?
Grab a fork, Vivian.
Well I guess I ought to be going.
You probably got college applications to fill out.
Well, yeah, actually, I do.
You probably want to hang out with educated people who drink their malt liquor in a glass.
What are you talking about, Jazz?
Face it, Will.
You're going to go off to college to be somebody and I'm going to be stuck here living foot to mouth.
I think you mean hand to mouth, Jazz.
Don't try to impress me with your fancy education.
You're going to go off next year to some big old college and I'll be sitting here by the phone waiting for you to call.
- You're not making any sense, Jazz.
- You used to think that was cute.
Wait a minute.
You mean this whole thing is about me going off to college?
Oh, comes the dawn.
My mother told me you was no good.
I knew I should have listened to her.
See, I promised myself I wasn't going to cry.
- Look, come on, Jazz.
- Get your hands off of me.
I'm not a faucet to be turned on and off at your whim.
I have emotions.
Jazz, yes, it's true that I'm going off to college, man, but Come on, you like family to me.
Jazz, just 'cause somebody moves away from the family that doesn't mean they break up.
That just means that, you know, the family has to work harder to stay together.
You understand what I'm saying?
No.
But at least you talking to me.
Come on, Jazz, you know you're always going to be my homey.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
I did say that.
Why don't you clean out your ears?
Now, I know you ain't talking about nobody's ears.
Hey, come on, man, let's jet down to the mall, pick up some Chumpies.
Will, could you do one thing for me?
You know, just for old time's sake.
Sure, no problem, man.
Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got me tossed I mean shoot.
I said, "shoot," Mom.
"I raised my boy better than that".
"Oh, God".

- Hey, good morning, G. - Good morning, Master William.
So, ready for the big camping expedition?
Please, man, I'm from Philly.
To me, a wilderness experience is dating a girl who don't shave her legs.
My uncle Reggie always insisted the woods were safer than the cities.
- Until the day he died.
- Word?
Yo, how'd he die?
He was eaten by wolves.
Carlton's log.
Earth date: 1992.
It's 6:00 a.m. Up with the dawn, the small band of brave souls prepare to pile into their Mercedes.
Destination: Adventure.
Carlton, you look like Webster on a safari.
Hi, guys.
I'm doing the morning weather today.
Oh, goody.
And after that, you're off to join Miss Ashley and Mrs. Banks at the spa for their beauty makeover weekend?
Beauty makeover?
With this face?
I don't think so.
Good morning, everyone.
You know, men, I'm really looking forward to this.
Reminds me of camping with my father.
Sleeping under the stars, climbing mountains braving winds that could knock a grown man flat to the ground.
Hey, man, I ain't trying to be nowhere around a wind that can knock Uncle Phil to the ground.
Well, I hope you prepared for rain.
I'm predicting a 90o/o chance of precipitation.
And you know how often I'm right.
Bye.
- Let's unpack the rain gear.
- Yeah.
Uncle Phil, I got a bad feeling about this one.
I mean, I think we should just turn back.
Will, you said that before we got in the car when we pulled out of the driveway when we pulled onto the freeway - when we pulled off the freeway.
- Then do it!
Come on, Uncle Phil, it's dark, it's raining, and we're lost.
- We are not lost.
- Will, ye of little faith.
- Dad knows exactly what he's doing.
- That's right.
Do you think anyone would drive by the same tree seven times on purpose?
Carlton's log.
We're somewhere in the galaxy.
My father has no idea where.
Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I think we should just pull into a gas station.
Will, for the last time, I don't need directions.
You're right.
You need gas.
Okay, I made a wrong turn.
It's no big deal, it's not the end of the world.
We'll just We'll thumb a ride to the nearest gas station.
We used to do it a lot in the '60s.
Uncle Phil, can you take a stroll into the '90s, please?
We are three black men on the side of a mountain road.
The only people that's going to stop is going to have on sheets and saying stuff like, "Get them, Jim Bob".
Will may have a point, Dad.
Why don't we stay here and let him go get the gas?
We're all getting out of the car.
We can make camp right here and go for gas in the morning.
Let's get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
Oh, my God, look!
Where's our camping equipment?
Will, you were supposed to secure everything to the luggage rack.
I did.
Wait, this ain't the Volvo.
The car phone, we'll call for road service.
Yeah, great idea, Carlton.
You can tell them exactly where we are, too.
Somewhere in the dark between a rock and a tree.
/'m sorry, you are outside the ca//ing area.
P/ease try your ca// again.
Well, I guess sending for pizza's out.
All right, now, that's it, that's enough.
We'll just get back in the car and go for gas in the morning.
Now get in the car.
- But you just - Get in the car!
You know, Uncle Phil, now, I haven't been on too many camping trips but snow is a bad thing, right?
Look.
Let's look on the bright side, okay?
This will give us a perfect opportunity to pull together and show what we're made of.
Does Bigfoot have to come down here with a chain saw before you admit we're in trouble?
Okay, we can't stay here, we'll freeze to death.
Just get all the stuff out of the back seat.
We'll go ahead on foot.
Get out of the car.
- But you just - Get out of the damn car!
You know, Miss Hilary I've never seen this side of you before.
Baggy clothes, no makeup, tousled hair.
You know, I feel really comfortable like this, too, Geoffrey.
I mean, I don't need to hide behind cosmetics.
I'm beautiful just the way I am.
Hilary, you home?
Oh, my God.
It's Trevor.
Quick, get my hot comb.
Sorry, this is the scene where Barbara finds out Robert's been cheating with a button-nosed bimbo.
For you, pretty mama.
Trevor, he's adorable.
- Goodbye.
- Wait a second.
I also brought you these.
Trevor, they're beautiful.
They look just like the flowers down at the newsroom.
Just be sure to have them back before 10:00.
My florist is on vacation.
Oh, my.
You look beautiful.
Here.
Why don't you put this on ice?
- Champagne?
- Yeah.
What are we celebrating?
An empty house.
Yoo-hoo!
I thought this was your day off.
Correct, but you overlooked one fact.
I have no life.
- Geoffrey, will you get it?
- On my day off?
You'd really let me?
Well, I thought we'd have a quiet evening together and I'd make you dinner.
Trevor, that is so sweet.
All right, now.
You get out of the kitchen.
I want this to be a surprise.
Surprise!
Jazz, what do you think you're doing?
Looking after you, my pet.
After all, you're a beautiful, desirable woman.
Or you would be if you combed your hair once in a while.
And some lipstick wouldn't kill you, either.
Look, Jazz, go home.
Stand back.
Let a man handle this.
No.
Jazz.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm cooking dinner.
Good, I like my steak medium-rare.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to freshen up a bit.
Get off me!
Would you See, a cave.
Told you everything would be all right.
I'm sorry.
I was trying to scare the bears away.
Carlton's log.
I'm wet.
I'm wet and I'm cold.
I'm wet and I'm cold and I'm in a cave.
Shut up, Carlton.
I'm shutting up.
I'm shutting up and I'm wet.
- That's it!
- Hey.
Just relax!
Look, come on.
Now, we'll build a fire.
How are we supposed to build a fire, Uncle Phil?
It's snowing outside.
All the wood is soaking wet.
Then we'll freeze to death.
I don't want to die.
I want to go to college and poke fun at all the kids on financial aid.
I want to see Karate Kid 17.
Carlton.
Don't panic.
Will, you check the cave for dry wood.
Man, I ain't walking around in this cave by myself.
There's rats and bats and bears and stuff all over the place.
Me, neither, Dad.
I think the three of us should just cuddle up close together for the night.
I'm going to go check the cave for some wood.
- I found this bag, Uncle Phil.
- Will, we can't just burn a bag.
We're helpless, it's over, we're dead.
- We're rich!
- What?
Hey, back up, back up!
$25,000.
Do you all mind if I get butt naked and roll around in this for a little while?
Will, we're going to have to turn that money over to the authorities.
If nobody claims it, then you can keep it, but until then, I think I should look after it.
Whoa, no!
I'm all right, Uncle Phil.
I'll just find a safe place to keep it, you know, just for the night.
Goodnight, Abe.
Goodnight, Alexander.
And I can't forget you, Ben.
Man, I'm sleeping with the presidents.
Must be what Marilyn Monroe felt like.
What's for dinner?
Jazz, I told you to go home.
How fast were you going when you hit this?
Now, see here, homey.
My lady and I are trying to have an intimate moment.
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to make me jealous.
Well, it worked like a charm.
Beat it, buddy.
How dare you talk to me like that?
Do you have any idea who I am?
A really bad cook?
Trevor, could you excuse us for a moment, please?
I have never been so insulted in my life.
Blind people recognize me.
- I could kill you.
- Okay, baby, hurt me.
Look, I am not going to let you screw this up for me.
Trevor is a wonderful man.
But I'm Jazz, the lover of all lovers.
I put the "afro" in aphrodisiac.
So lose the stiff, and I'll be waiting in the pool house.
And fix yourself up a little.
What happened to your friend?
Don't worry about him.
What are you watching?
One of those silly sentimental films, formula stuff.
Can I watch with you?
Sure.
But I have to go home in a few minutes.
I don't want to alarm either one of you but it's about 20 degrees in here, and it's only going to get worse.
Carlton's log.
I hate Dad.
You know, this wood is just too wet to ignite.
We need something dry.
I'm afraid it's going to have to be something that's near and dear to all of us.
Come on, Uncle Phil, at least knock him out first.
I'm talking about the money, Will.
Will.
Do you want to die with $25,000 by your side or do you want to live to see tomorrow?
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, all right?
- I'm afraid there's no other choice.
- All right.
Look, can I just have a few minutes alone with the guys?
Okay.
Dad.
When you throw that money into the fire if I lose my head and leap in after it you'll pull me out, right?
Son, there are more important things in life than money.
Yeah, but I can't get a date, either.
All right, here's the money.
What?
- Was that Andrew or Ben?
- It was Ben.
I'm sorry, Ben.
You was one of the few white people I could really count on.
Carlton's log.
Will has been reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self.
I, on the other hand, have the strength of 10 men.
Will's log is about to connect with Carlton's head!
Hey.
Hey, Will, give me the log.
That's not why I brought you two up here.
I really blew it.
All I wanted to do was spend some time with you before you went off to college.
You know, there was a better way of doing it, Uncle Phil.
Perhaps a matinee and a box of Raisinets.
Raisinets?
I hate Raisinets.
Can we get some Goobers?
It's not the same.
Some of the best memories of my life are camping with my father.
He taught me how to hunt and fish, how to pitch a tent.
I'm guessing he didn't teach you how to use a compass.
Now that he's gone I really miss him.
I really appreciate what we had together.
He was quite a man.
I learned so much from him.
That's decent, Uncle Phil.
At least you had somebody to teach you stuff, you know?
I had to learn everything on my own.
I mean, my mom was working all the time and everything.
Like, I wanted to roller skate but, you know, I didn't even really know how to do it.
So I used to put on one skate and push with the other foot.
Never seemed like I could be fast enough to keep up with the other kids, though.
You know, actually that's how I felt when I came to Bel-Air, you know?
It's like everybody had two skates, and I was trying to keep up with one.
Thanks for my other skate, Uncle Phil.
For a long time it gave me nightmares having to witness an injustice like that.
It was a constant reminder of how unfair this world can be.
I can still hear them taunting him: "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids".
How come they just couldn't give him some cereal?
- You guys, wake up.
Wake up.
- Whoa, man.
We made it.
We made it.
Uncle Phil, wake up.
Vivian, I'm not a machine!
Come on, Dad, it's morning.
What do you know, it stopped snowing.
Come on, let's get the hell out of here and find a Denny's.
Uncle Phil, if I ever agree to go camping with you all just hold my head underwater till I stop struggling.
- Here we go now.
- Congratulations.
- What's up?
- Right this way, guys, right this way.
Come right over here.
Right over here.
Hey, guys, listen.
I'm Ed Barker from station KCBE.
- Congratulations, guys.
You did it.
- We did?
- That's right.
Now what are your names?
- Well, I'm innocent Will.
And this is Uncle Phil, attorney at law, and this is little Carlton.
He's trying to find his way back to the circus.
- What did we do?
- And was it legal?
Homey, we was going to give the money back, man, but my uncle Give it back?
It's yours to keep.
See, you just found the last clue in the KCBE scavenger hunt.
You found the prize money.
Well, now tell me something, guys.
How does it feel to be rich?
Terrible.
Uncle Backdraft made us burn it.
- You burned $50,000?
- $50,000?
You said it was $25,000.
I must have miscounted.
Oh, well.
Taught me how to hunt, how to fish, how to pinch a tent y ou know, you pinch y ou got to pinch it right down there.
You know, right by the pole where they put in the Let's sketch it.
How to pinch a tent?
Come here, you cute /itt/e tent.
/'m gonna pinch you.
You is a cute /itt/e tent.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Will, I can't believe I took your advice about my TV campaign spot.
Uncle Phil, you really would have buried Judge Robertson if you would have let me put the Uh-Huh Girls in there with you.
It would have been like, "Banks is the right one, baby, uh-huh"!
- Here it comes.
- Come, sit down.
Oh, and by the way, Uncle Phil I don't remember if I told you or not, but when I dropped the tape off at the editor I just, you know, authorized a few last minute changes.
You authorized a few Nobody gave you permission to authorize any changes.
No, but it's cool, Uncle Phil, you're going to love it.
Here it comes.
Hi, /'m Phi/ip Banks, and /'m running for Superior Court Judge.
What the hell is that?
That was our New y ear's Eve party.
Uncle Phil, you know, I just put in a couple of home movies you know, to show your human side.
It gets better, check it out.
And if you put me on the bench, /'// take a rea/ bite out of crime.
Bite.
Vote for Phi/ip Banks.
Phi/ip Banks.
Emmy!
Hey, so what do you think, Uncle Phil?
Dad Will would like to know if he can please come in.
Come on, Daddy, at least let him sleep in the house.
Come on, Philip, he was only trying to help.
Come on, baby, come on in.
Look, Uncle Phil, I know we didn't exactly see eye to eye on the commercial - but I got a lot of positive feedback.
- Oh, please, from who?
From Latisha.
She said you looked really handsome.
But she also thought Delta Burke looked better as a blonde.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, guys.
Baby, you are positively glowing today.
Thank you.
New moisturizer.
We can't all be as blessed as you are, Mom.
Trevor, that's so sweet.
But, honey, call me Mrs. Banks.
Home of the Whopper, what's your beef?
Yeah, right.
Okay.
Will, who is it?
Some chicken here talking about she from the Oprah Winfrey Show.
That would be for me, homey.
Alexis.
Yes, so did you speak to Oprah yet?
What, you mean this call's legit?
Will, Trevor knows lots of very important people.
So, what about Oprah?
Is it a deal?
Super.
I owe you big time, babe.
This is Trevor Collins, goodbye and Godspeed.
What's all this excitement?
What's going on?
I don't know.
What's all this excitement?
- We're all going to be on Oprah.
- We're all gonna be on Oprah.
And it's all thanks to Trevor.
Well Wait a minute.
Trevor, why should Oprah care anything about us?
Well, actually, Phil, she doesn't, you're nobody.
But Alexis, the woman who books the show, is an old friend of Trevor's.
I kind of got the feeling she had a crush on you.
Well Actually, she had the cutest little nickname for me.
- What was it?
- God.
Anyway, Alexis said I couldn't have called at a better time.
They're doing a show about political candidates and their families and she said that one of the families just dropped out.
So they're flying all of us to Chicago tomorrow morning.
I'm so excited.
I have always wanted to go to Chicago.
Wait, am I going to need a passport?
All right, I got things to do.
I got to get a new fade.
I got to get some new shoestrings for my Doc Martens.
Oh, man.
I'm going to be on Oprah!
Phil, I hate to bust the boy's balloon but Alexis said she could only book the immediate family.
You mean Will can't go?
That's darned unfair.
And I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say: "What am I going to wear"?
Philip honey, how can we disappoint Will?
He's a part of this family.
No, Vivian, he's a part of your family.
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but he's damaged my campaign enough.
And the sooner we tell him he's not coming with us the easier it will be on him.
Hey, Mom, guess what, I'm going to be on Oprah.
And as soon as you tell him, let me know.
Morning.
Philip, honey, how come you're not dressed?
We're leaving in an hour.
Oh, sweetheart, relax.
We have plenty of time.
So how did Will take it when you finally broke the news to him?
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell him.
Fine, I'll tell him.
How difficult could it possibly be?
So, what do you think?
Have we met?
Come on, Uncle Phil, I just wanted to fit in with you all when we go on Oprah.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil I got to tell you, man, taking me to Chicago with you that really means a lot to me.
Yeah, you know, Will, there And it ain't just because I promised Latisha I was going to scream her name out on TV.
It's because, you know, you really make me feel like part of your family.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
I guess I'll just go out in the car and wait quietly in the back seat.
- Well, that's telling him, Philip.
- All right, look he can go to Chicago with us and watch the show - but we have to tell him on the plane.
- Okay.
- Excuse me, sir, are you Will Smith?
- Yes, stewardess.
Your family asked me to speak to you.
Wow, I'm sorry for staring, but man, girl, you real fine.
You know, I was a little nervous about flying, but as long as I can look at you, I know I'll be all right.
I'm sorry, what was you going to say to me?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Wow.
Look at this.
Vivian, this is absurd.
We're going to be on the air in 10 minutes.
We have got to tell Will now.
Oprah Winfrey's studio.
Hey, come on you all, let's get a picture.
Uncle Phil, I'll get you in one later.
Look, Oprah's chair.
I'm gonna send this to my mom.
Honey, couldn't we just put him to sleep?
You must be the Banks family.
Hi, I'm Alexis.
Hi.
I'm glad you could make it on such short notice.
- Well, thank you for having us.
- Sure.
Listen, just make yourselves at home and I'll be right back.
- You have beautiful hair.
- I know.
So, that's Trevor's old girlfriend, huh?
Yeah, wonder what he ever saw in her.
Okay, everybody remember, Dad's got an image to uphold here.
So let's conduct ourselves with dignity.
Look, Mommy, Daddy, look!
You y ou're Oprah Winfrey.
- I am and that means you must be - Ashley.
It's nice to meet you.
- We're the Banks.
- Hey, great, you made it.
- Welcome to Chicago.
- Thank you, this is a real pleasure.
I'm Philip Banks.
This is Hilary, Carlton, Ashley and - Vivian!
- Yes.
Hi, I'm a very big fan.
You sure are.
It's my pleasure.
Oprah, I always love your clothes.
And that's such a gorgeous suit.
Well, I tell you what, if you really like it, I will send you one in your size.
Wow!
I always heard that you were generous, but Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
Me neither.
Gee, Oprah, I really like that diamond bracelet.
Nice try.
Hey, I tell you what, I'll see you guys on the show.
- Okay?
See you on TV.
Have a good show.
- Thank you.
Hey, that's it.
That's the theme music.
Come on, it's time to go, posse up.
Come on.
Come on, guys, it's time to go.
- Philip.
- All right.
It's time to stop beating around the bush.
Okay, everybody who's going to be on the Oprah Show, take one step forward.
Not so fast, Will.
You know, all families have their problems, but how would you like to have your family's dirty laundry seen in tomorrow's newspaper?
Well, that's an everyday experience for most political families.
Please help me welcome my guests today.
Sen.
Howard Lloyd his wife Pamela and their daughter, Lydia.
And Superior Court hopeful, Philip Banks his wife, Vivian, and their children, Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley.
So, Sen.
Lloyd, my first question is to you.
Now you've been a member of the Senate for quite some time.
Tell me I can't be on Oprah.
Hey, brother, you mind sliding inside my legs are kind of long, I'd like to sit here.
Oh, excuse me.
Philip Banks, you were a successful attorney with your own private practice in Beverly Hills.
And now, you're running for Superior Court Judge.
We all know that's quite a career change.
What do you hope to get out of it?
I hope to make some changes in the judicial system and, well I've always wanted my own gavel.
Oprah, I have a question.
We're not ready for that portion of the show just yet, but, Mrs. Banks - answer me this if you will.
- I'm Will, Oprah, I can answer it.
- Come here.
- Come?
Me come?
Come here.
Come on.
Okay, see, this is it.
I'm the one with the microphone.
And you can't answer a question until I ask the question.
You understand how it works?
You ask then I answer.
It works like Good.
Now sit down.
Sit down.
My God.
Vivian, is that Will?
No, Philip, it's Richard Nixon wearing a Will mask.
No, Mom, I think that really is Will.
So, Lydia, you've spent most of your life on Capitol Hill.
- Did that have any - Oh, Oprah.
Young brother what do you want?
I was just wondering, is it the question portion yet?
- Do you have a question?
- Yes.
Okay, what is your question?
I have a question for Sen.
Lloyd.
Senator, let's say that, you know, you had a young urban handsome nephew.
Would you let him come on the Oprah Winfrey Show with you?
Well, I sure would, son.
And let me say, I love your Leslie Uggams.
Thanks.
- My next question is for Mr. Banks.
- Two questions?
Yeah.
Mr. Banks would you let your nephew come on the Oprah Winfrey Show or would you make him fly all the way to Chicago for nothing to sit out in the audience, to be embarrassed in front of his girl.
Hi, Latisha.
Huh?
And after I got out of Betty Ford I started a new life with the Maharishi Anaghanda.
You are so brave.
I mean, wearing red shoes with a pink dress.
I have a question for Mr. Banks.
Has being in politics ruined your sex life?
No, mine's great, how's yours, honey?
Oprah, I have a question.
Will, I missed you.
Okay.
My question is for Mrs. Banks.
Mrs. Banks, let's say that your oldest sister, who sacrificed her whole life to raise you, sent her only son out to live with you and you promised to treat him like your own.
And just for the sake of argument, let's call him Will.
Would you bring him on the Oprah Winfrey Show with you or would you make him sit in the audience like you're ashamed of him?
We're not ashamed of you.
It's just Sit down, shut up, and behave yourself.
Okay, let me take a wild stab in the dark here.
You all are related?
Yes, Oprah.
See, it's all coming out, it's all coming out.
Anybody got a tissue, anybody?
Thank you.
Yes.
Here, you poor sweetheart.
Blow.
You poor baby.
I mean, I think this is terrible.
This is y ou should go up there and be with your family, where you belong.
Don't you think so, audience?
Go on up there and be with your family, where you belong.
Move, Ashley, move.
Thank you, Oprah.
You know, Oprah, there's a perfectly logical explanation for y es, yes.
Oprah, this guy can't even run his own home.
Why should he be elected to office?
Excuse me, miss, but my husband would make an excellent judge.
He is a wonderful husband and a devoted father.
Well, Vivian, I must say that, yes, you're right.
This looks like it's a very lovely family, but I've been doing shows a long time.
And one of the things I've learned is things are not always as they seem.
Oprah, believe me, my dad is a great guy.
I mean, when I lost my job and he kicked me out of the house he let me live out back.
He kicked you out of the house?
Well, he didn't actually kick her out of the house.
He just changed all the locks and told her she didn't live there anymore.
Mr. Banks, is that true?
Well, I didn't change all the locks, and and she's not living out back, she's living in the pool house.
Well, with the big pay cut you'll have to take, we'll all be living in the pool house.
Look, you can forget it.
There's hardly enough room for Trevor and I, as it is.
What is Trevor doing in the pool house?
Yes, Hilary, what is Trevor doing in the pool house?
Yeah, this is good now, this is good.
I feel like we I think we're getting somewhere.
Listen to me.
Hilary, you are not to have men in the pool house.
Look, I don't like to tell tales out of school, but Trevor keeps a make-up case there.
- That's a lie.
- Is not.
Stand on a chair and say that to my face.
You have both lost your American Express cards.
Do you want to work on your Visa?
These candidates before you say they want to be elected to public office but it seems like they can't even keep the peace in their own families.
Mr. Banks, what do you have to say on your family's behalf?
Well, Oprah What's the point?
- Look, Oprah, I have something to say.
- What a surprise.
Now, look, my uncle brought me out from Philadelphia to live with him so I could get a head start in life.
And, now, we have some problems, but what family doesn't?
All I know is when I need these people, they are right there for me.
That's nice of you to say, Will.
Well, if you ask me your whole damn family is crazy.
All right, see brother, if we was in Philly, it might have to be something.
But we on TV and I believe Martin's philosophy non-violence, so I'm going to chill.
I'm going to chill.
And if your mama sent you out here to live with them then she's crazy, too.
Hey, man, don't nobody talk about my mother, man.
We'll be right back.
Hey, Ms. Winfrey.
Will, I'll tell you what you know, after all we've been through, you can call me Oprah.
You got it, Ope Oprah.
You know, your initials, O. W?
Did anybody ever tell you that spells "ow"?
I knew that.
Look, Oprah I hope I didn't mess your show up too much.
And I'm really sorry for the way I acted.
Listen, don't you apologize, because I'm thinking it was a great experience.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
As a matter of fact, here What's this?
Two free tickets to the Donahue Show.
Tell Phil Oprah said, "Hi".
She likes me.
On the nationa/ po/itica/ scene Come on, we've heard enough, turn the TV down.
Come on, Will.
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
Will, you're smiling like Dad does when he finishes the Happy Birthday bucket at Baskin-Robbins.
Man, you scream your girl's name out on TV, you'd be smiling, too.
- Look, Dad, the poll results are up next.
- Oh, goody.
Come on, Daddy.
I bet being on Oprah really helped you in the polls.
I'm not worried.
You know, I was going about this all wrong.
I was trying to come across as the perfect candidate with the perfect family.
Voters want a candidate that's human, flawed.
And in /oca/ po/itics Phi/ip Banks has p/ummeted another 8 points in the po//s.
Oh, come on, honey, don't worry.
You're going to win.
Uncle Phil, you're going to win.
And you know why?
'Cause you're a decent man.
I mean, you brought a kid out from West Philly and you made him feel at home in your house.
I mean, there is no way that Judge Robertson can compete with that.
And in a re/ated story, Judge Car/ Robertson announced today that he is adopting 12 ghetto youths.
Oh, well.
You have both lost your y ou have both lost your American y ou have both - Oh, God!
- You have just made the blooper reel.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I figured it out, Will.
I'm gonna get Dad what he always wanted.
What, a Pizza Hut in the garage?
Better.
I'm going to clinch the election by getting an influential person to endorse him.
Watch and learn.
Hello, is President Bush there?
Carlton.
Carlton Banks.
It's personal.
Carlton, are you by any chance an idiot?
Not available?
Perhaps you should let George know that as Alternate Assistant Treasurer to the Bel-Air Junior Republicans I'm in a position to scratch his back if he'll scratch mine, capische?
Hello?
- Hey, G, did you bring the mail in yet?
- No.
I've been saving that genteel pleasure to calm myself lest I get too giddy from scrubbing the john.
You know, you really need a woman, G. What's a woman?
I'll get the mail.
- Geoffrey.
- Sir.
Daddy, now, you know how much I love you.
I would do anything for you, right?
- All right, Hilary, how much do you want?
- No, I'm talking about Well, $100.
But I was talking about the election.
Now, for me to vote for you in good conscience I need to know where you stand on the issues.
Okay, well, I'm against plea bargaining and I'm for y eah, but where do you stand on a woman's right to choose the restaurant?
I think we should leave that up to the Supreme Court.
Well, I think you're being really unreasonable.
Well, tough.
I don't care if it is chaperoned.
You cannot go to Ensenada with Macaulay Culkin.
Hey, mail call!
For you, Se/f magazine Shape magazine and Sassy magazine.
And for you, sir, E/f magazine Ape magazine and Sissy magazine.
And, for you, sir the bill for Se/f, the bill for Shape, and the bill for Sassy magazines.
- Uncle Phil, they're dogging you.
- What?
Let me see that.
"Defeat Philip Banks, the criminal's choice for Superior Court Judge.
"Banks wants to empty the prisons, fill our streets with hoodlums "and run a bookmaking operation out of his chambers.
"Vote Robertson for Superior Court Judge".
But Dad, aren't some of those lies?
Carlton, honey, they're all lies.
How can they get away with that?
'Cause they know it's too late for me to sue for a retraction.
- Well, there's still time to fight back.
- I'm not gonna fight back.
What?
If I sink to their level, I'm just as bad as they are.
- Uncle Phil, let me tell you a little story.
- Oh, no.
See, once upon a time there was this young boy that lived in Philly, right?
And right next to him lived the prettiest little honey you ever seen in your life.
And he loved her with his whole heart and soul.
Amen, sister.
But see, on the other side of that girl lived this little, filthy McRotten dude and he wanted her just for her body, right?
So one day, the two dudes was about to get it on, right?
The girl came out and stopped them.
She said, "No, flip a coin and the winner can be my boyfriend," right?
So the nasty dude snatch off into his pocket, right?
Calls heads, flips the coin the nice guy lost the toss, and the girl, and it broke his heart.
- And do you know why he lost?
- Why?
Because the nasty dude cheated.
He had a two-headed coin.
The nice guy didn't get the girl.
So, this story is about you, isn't it, Will?
That's right, Uncle Phil.
And to this day I just thank God I had my two-headed coin 'cause that girl was smoking, man.
- The poll results are in.
- Let's go see what And the race for Superior Court Judge is neck and neck.
Robertson and Banks are both po//ing 36%o.
At this point, anything cou/d tip the ba/ance.
More after this.
/f Banks gets into office, we won't have to hide anymore this city's ours!
Un/ike my opponent, / don't think crime shou/d pay.
/ say, throw the bums in jai/.
Over the /ast 20 years, Judge Robertson has thrown over 6,000 bums in jai/.
Phi/ip Banks, none.
Crimina/s support Phi/ip Banks.
Shou/d you?
Throw the bums in jai/.
Say, "Phi/ip Banks, no thanks," on E/ection Day.
Uncle Phil, you got to kick that man's butt.
He like begging, he like, "Philip Banks, kick my butt".
- Philip Banks, kick the man's butt.
- Can't do it, Vivian.
I'm running an honest campaign.
Philip, that man is evil and senile.
Why not fight fire with fire?
Because it goes against everything I stand for.
What's your point?
I have made my decision.
I'm gonna base my campaign on the issues, not the dirt.
I have faith in L.A.
That L.A. Will have faith in me.
With over 90%o of the districts reporting Judge Robertson has overwhe/ming/y defeated Phi/ip Banks.
I hate L.A. And there's the loser now!
Let's listen in as he makes his concession speech.
Everyone, I want to thank you for your support.
We put up a good fight and well it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances that saw y ou don't have to shove, we got two exits!
Mr. Banks not in recent memory has someone managed to lose a race by such a large margin.
And so darn quickly.
How does it feel?
Well, once when I was a kid I zipped my pants up too fast let's just say this brings back old memories.
On a brighter note, I see you've brought your lovely family with you including your daughter, KFPB weather personality, Hilary Banks.
Hilary, you have just seen your father suffer a humiliating defeat.
So tell me, are you free for dinner tonight?
Look, my father just lost an election.
I mean, I'm not totally insensitive.
- How about tomorrow?
- Great.
Well, from the Banks headquarters, this is Trevor Collins feeling pretty good.
Now, everybody, put on your best faces.
It's time to go give the victor his due.
Damn!
Uncle Phil, I got your back.
Well, I got like half your back 'cause your back's like Want some candy, little girl?
Come here.
Judge Robertson, to what do you attribute your reelection?
To getting more votes than the other guy.
I mean, why did you get more votes, sir?
Well, why didn't you say so, Connie?
You see, all the credit goes to my campaign workers who brought me up when I was down.
Judge Robertson.
Well, who do we have here?
- Carl - I thought I was Carl.
I just wanna congratulate you on a campaign well fought, sir.
Well, coming from you, Carl, that means a lot.
- I'm Philip.
- And I am the walrus.
Let's get the hell out of here.
That was fun.
There goes Philip Banks the biggest sap that ever lived.
What a stooge.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
He's a sap, a dope, a loser.
He never had what it takes and he never will.
Isn't that right?
I think you should take that back, man.
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.
Well, I think you should run along and play.
And don't get involved in politics until you're a big boy.
At least my uncle stands for something.
Really?
And what would that be?
A buffet?
My uncle fights for what he believes in.
Shame on me.
My uncle's three times the man you will ever be.
He's got my vote.
And another thing: Everything you said in your campaign was a lie.
You have no integrity, no decency, and you're really, really short.
And I'll tell you another thing, if you don't like it, man, you can drop dead.
Oh, my God, he's dead.
Come on, man, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
How are you doing, baby?
I just feel so guilty, Aunt Viv.
Come on, now, you gotta stop blaming yourself, Will.
He wasn't a young man, he didn't take very good care of himself.
- Now, you heard what the doctor said.
- I know, Aunt Viv.
If I could just forget it, just clear my mind for one minute.
Well, Will, you really knocked them dead the other night, huh?
Don't get him mad, Mom.
You don't want to make him raise his voice.
Carlton, take out the trash, honey.
I did it last week, it's the Terminator's turn.
Dan Quayle, please.
I'll hold.
Carlton, why are you calling Dan Quayle?
Simple.
Thanks to the Grim Reaper over here and Judge Robertson taking the old dirt nap the governor has to appoint someone and the right endorsement could swing it to Dad.
Yeah, Carlton Banks.
That's B-A-N-K-S.
No E. That was a joke, ma'am.
Hello?
The phone's dead, Will.
Carlton, man, I am not a killer.
That's not funny.
Ashley, you know I'd never hurt you, right?
I know.
Hilary, you know that I would never Hurt a fly.
We know.
Look, Will, you're taking this way too seriously.
I mean, it's not like you got a bad haircut.
Look, I think I know how to help Will.
This calls for tough love.
We've gotta draw him out.
We've gotta bait him, confront him attack him until he defends himself.
Only then will he start to feel better.
- I don't know, Carlton.
- Look, just follow my lead.
Will, you should be ashamed of yourself.
How could you do such a thing?
Hope you never get mad at me.
Why are y'all screaming at me?
I was minding my damn business eating some fruit.
Well, I could be wrong.
You won't believe this.
They want me to give the eulogy at Judge Robertson's funeral.
You're kidding.
Philip, you know, I really hate to speak ill of the dead but if that little man hadn't died I would have killed him myself.
- So, who's up for Chinese food?
- I'd like some.
I'm gonna give the eulogy, Vivian.
- Philip, no.
- Dad, how could you say yes?
I know Carl changed over the years but the man was my mentor.
And I'm going to that funeral.
And you're all going with me.
Philip, any chance of getting those flowers after the funeral?
Sit down, Vivian.
I'd like to welcome you to the memorial for Carl Robertson.
Saying a few words on behalf of the departed will be Philip Banks.
- Vivian, where's my speech?
- It's on the kitchen counter where I Sorry, Philip.
What can you say about Judge Carl Robertson?
What indeed?
He was a judge.
A judge named Carl.
But he was more.
So much more.
Carl He wasn't a very heavy man.
Look, I'm probably the wrong person to be up here.
I mean, I just got finished losing an election to the man in which he used every dirty trick in the book.
So, at this time I'd like to invite someone with an especially warm memory of Carl Robertson to come up here and share it with us.
Anyone with a somewhat fond memory of Carl Robertson.
Anybody with any recollection of him at all.
Yes.
The jerk sentenced me to six months in jail for a crime I didn't commit.
I'm just here to make sure he dead.
Thank you.
Yes.
He hired me to replant his garden.
And when it came time for him to pay me he called Immigration on me.
Gracias.
I knew Carl, biblically.
Please.
Sorry.
With him it was just a bunch of sex all the time, like dating Thumper.
Never felt I really got to know him never felt he cared about my needs.
- You were his wife?
- His mistress.
Okay.
For 20 years.
Longest years of my life.
You don't have any pleasant memories at all of him?
Well no.
The man's idea of sweet talk was: "When you gonna bring your sister around"?
Well, thank you for sharing.
Hold up here a minute.
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
A man is dead here, people.
I mean, did he not feel pain when he was hurt?
I mean, did he not shiver when he was cold?
Did he not dream?
I mean, he was only human, but yes, he was human.
And I fail to believe that the world can profit from a man's death.
And I think each and every one of you should be really ashamed of yourselves.
And who are you?
I'm the dude that killed him.
- Tough room.
- Yeah.
Carlton, you're just wasting your time, man.
Ye of little faith.
I'm about to get the endorsement that will lock up Dad's appointment.
Hello, is Vanna there?
Well, I think heaven is this wonderful place where all the people are good-Iooking nothing clashes, and you never have to wait for a table.
And hell is like the Valley.
What do you think, Daddy?
I think we're all damn lucky Hilary has a job.
Thanks, Daddy.
Now, see, to me heaven has to be like a cross between a Sir Mix-A-Lot video and Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
See, it's like I can have a leg in one hand and a breast in the other.
So what do you think, G?
I think I must have been very bad in a previous life.
You know, I don't know why people are so down on funerals.
Banks residence.
- For you, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
Yes?
Yes, Governor.
Yes, it was unfortunate.
Why, of course, sir, yes.
It's an honor, thank you, sir.
Yes.
Well, what was all that?
The Governor just appointed me to Judge Robertson's seat!
- Yes, you're the man!
- Yes.
- This calls for champagne.
- Yeah.
Could I get it for you?
Why are y'all screaming at me?
I was minding my damn business eating some fruit.
You screamed at me.
Well, I could be wrong.
What in the he// did you just do with your /ips?
A// right!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
No, no, don't, please.
Please, don't shoot.
What's going on in here?
Oh, my God.
Geoffrey, don't move.
There's a dart on your forehead.
Really?
I hadn't noticed.
- Look, Carlton, Geoffrey's been shot.
- Cool.
You people don't pay me enough for this.
Quiet, Geoffrey, you're dead.
Then you couldn't possibly feel me do this.
- Well, one down, three to go.
- Wait.
Is anybody going to tell me what's going on?
We're playing Whodunnit.
See, one of us is the killer, and we have to find out who it is.
I say, we already know.
You and I were together in the other room, Ashley and now Geoffrey's worm chow.
So that leaves only one suspect.
Honey, I'm home.
Hey, Lucy.
Ethel, hello.
Look, it's little Ricky.
Oh, y'all should go check outside.
Somebody was trampling through Aunt Viv's garden.
Nice try, Will.
You got Geoffrey, but you're not gonna get me alone.
Come on, Ashley, we're going to the bathroom.
What is he talking about?
I ain't kill nobody.
Yeah, and George Bush is really looking forward to playing with his grandchildren.
Man, this is whack.
Don't nobody believe me.
But I bet you do, right?
Good, Aunt Vivian.
Good, Aunt Vivian.
Here, beg for a Scooby Snack.
Cut it out.
I'm trying to practice my breathing for Lamaze class.
I don't know, Aunt Viv.
Seem to me all that heavy breathing is what got you in this mess in the first place.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Will.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
You ready for your Lamaze class?
Philip, you mean, you actually wanna take me?
I was waiting for some lame excuse.
Last week, you said your dog died.
- He did.
- Philip, he died 20 years ago.
Still hurts.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, Aunt Viv.
Now this is the most straight-up, honest dude I know.
The day that he lies to you, may all my hair fall out.
Thank you, Will.
Come on, sweetheart, we don't want to be late.
- Okay.
- Okay, let me get the bags here.
Philip.
- Philip, what's the matter?
- It's my back, went out.
You know, I think maybe if I could lay down on the couch for a couple of hours you know?
Oh, my God, is my hairline receding?
Come on, Philip, sit down.
Now, Will, we all know your uncle's got back problems.
Now, relax, sweetheart.
Okay, I'll go to class again, alone.
Will, would you take my duffel bag out to the car for me?
Yeah, that's fine, Aunt Viv.
Yes!
Freeze, bubble-butt!
This could get ugly.
Philip, what do you have to say for yourself?
Good answer, Admiral Stockdale.
Philip, this is very important to me.
After all, you missed all the other births of your other children.
Well, it wasn't my fault.
Fathers weren't allowed in the delivery room back then.
They are now, and I would like you to share this experience.
Well, I intend to.
I will be pacing up and down in the waiting room where a man's supposed to be.
- Fine.
If that's the way you feel, forget it!
- Wait, Vivian.
- And what's your problem?
- Don't be trying to make up with me now.
I'm all pregnant.
My feet, my back, and stuff hurt, and you being all insensitive.
Here's our little mother.
There we go, madam, a nice glass of milk.
- Got to keep our strength up, eh?
- Back off, Geoffrey.
Pop a Midol.
Geoffrey, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little upset with Mr. Banks, that's all.
He refuses to be my Lamaze coach.
So I'm gonna need one of you kids to go with me.
- Sorry, homework.
- Tennis lesson.
I just don't want to.
Madam, are you sure you want another one?
Wait a minute, here.
Look, what is the matter with y'all?
I mean, this is your mother.
She's having a baby.
Look, Aunt Viv, if I was one of your kids I'd be short with a square head but I'd be more than happy to be your coach.
Aunt Viv, it was a joke.
You can't take a joke?
Come on, Will.
I'm gonna be doing all the work.
All you have to do is cheer me on.
Come on.
Well, that's cool.
Go, Vivian.
Get busy, have a baby.
- See you later.
- Will, come on, stop it.
Honey, this is a classroom, not a delivery room.
There's nothing here to embarrass you.
Come on.
- Aunt Viv, you naked yet?
- Will, would you calm down?
No one is gonna get naked.
Come on.
Whoa, Aunt Viv, who is she?
Man, she is all that.
She's fine.
She's one of The Fat Boys.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hey, Viv.
How are you?
Hey, you know, can you do me a favor?
I have not seen my feet since Lent.
Can you tell me, do my shoes match?
No.
Damn.
Well - I see Phil stood you up again, huh?
- Right.
- Who's the designated hitter?
- This is my nephew.
- How you doing?
I'm Will.
- Danny Mitchell.
So I guess your husband will be showing up any minute, huh?
- No, he's in Mexico.
- On vacation?
No, on his secretary.
But don't worry, he's not having a good time.
I filled his thong with BenGay.
Remind me to stay on your good side, Danny.
Will, what's so funny?
It's just that a dude named Danny Mitchell is my favorite sportswriter.
- Well, you know, I could introduce you.
- Word?
Hey, how you doing?
You're the Danny Mitchell?
Wait, hold it.
I heard Charles Barkley on the radio talking about him and Danny was gonna rumble in the parking lot after the Laker game.
He won't show up, that wuss.
All righty, coaches let's get our mommies in a comfy position.
- Will?
- What?
That's right.
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
- That's good.
- Are you all right?
- You need some help there, Danny?
- Why, you got a forklift?
- Will?
- What?
Aren't you forgetting something?
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll help you, Vivian.
Now, I apologize.
You were right.
I have a responsibility, and I need to be here tonight.
No, you don't.
You just don't want to sleep on the couch, Philip.
I hate sleeping on that thing.
It's all lumpy.
Remember, partners, lots of touching and hugging.
Show each other how you really feel.
- I showed up, didn't I?
- Yeah, Philip, for all the wrong reasons.
What is your problem, honey?
Having a baby is spiritual, and wonderful, and miraculous.
It doesn't sound miraculous.
It sounds yucky.
You should have thought about that seven months ago - before that second bottle of wine, Philip.
- Wait a minute.
Vivian.
Vivian, wait a minute.
Vivian, come on.
Hey, Uncle Phil, how's your back?
- Are they always like this?
- No, sometimes they fight.
Look, you better go out.
They might need a ref.
No, that's cool.
I'll stay here and help you out.
Great.
Will, I guess I owe you one.
You know what?
I am covering the Laker game on Saturday night.
- You want to watch from the press box?
- From the press box?
Okay, I can't breathe.
Okay, come on.
Lie back here.
Okay, take it slow.
Take it slow.
Breathe deeply.
Breathe deeply.
Okay, focus.
Focus with me.
Heck of a game, huh?
Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks, Tone.
This is fine.
- Cool.
- Nothing for you, Will?
- No, thanks.
I'm still tripping over that game.
It was hype.
Like, Worthy passes to Vlade.
Vlade back to Byron Scott.
Byron Scott back to Vlade.
Vlade gets the ball back to Worthy.
Worthy gets it, stuffs, pop.
The Lakers win the game!
The Lakers win the game!
You know what the high point of the game was for me, huh?
What?
When you punched Jack Nicholson in the nose for touching your stomach?
Indigestion.
I guess I shouldn't have had that third chili dog, huh?
So what's with this free-trade agreement?
They gonna set it up demographically, or what?
Tony, why aren't you driving?
'Cause nobody else is.
The parking lot's all jammed up.
You gonna eat those fries?
- What?
What's the matter?
- My water broke.
That's cool.
We got another one, right here in the fridge.
No, no.
I mean, I think I'm having the baby.
I just had the car cleaned.
Can't you hold it for a couple of hours?
I think that means, "No, Tone".
Do something, man!
You think I got time to Scotchgard?
- The woman's having a baby, you idiot.
- Hey, I have feelings, you know.
- Hey, I'm sorry, Tone.
Hey, Tone - Will, I need you.
Stay.
All right, it's cool, Danny.
All right, I know exactly what to do.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Damn you.
I said, "Help"!
Hey, is there a doctor in the parking lot?
- I'm a doctor.
- Thank God.
Look, Doc, I got a lady in here having a baby.
Yeah, you're going to have to climb over that car.
That's good.
All right, come on.
Wait, yo, look out.
Don't, man.
Is there a doctor for the doctor?
- Hey, how's it going, Danny?
- Not too bad.
It's kind of like trying to squeeze Della Reese out of a Hyundai!
All right, it's cool.
All right, look, I'm calling 911.
Don't bother.
We're in wall-to-wall traffic.
No ambulance can get through this.
Wait, here comes another one.
This time you better time me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
They're 10 seconds apart.
You're having a baby.
You think?
Danny, all right, look, I know what to do.
I'll call Aunt Viv.
- That's it, she'll know what to do.
- Okay.
- Hello?
- Hi, Wi//.
Wait, slow down.
I can't understand you.
No, I don't know where Mom is.
Wait, what's the problem?
Sure.
Look, Will, I don't have time for your little pranks.
I have a date.
What are you doing?
Look, I'm not even playing that stupid murder game, so Look, don't aim that thing at me.
Hilary, are you there?
Well, I hope you're all happy.
Now I'm gonna have a big, ugly, red circle in the middle of my forehead.
I'll look just like Carlton's yearbook picture.
Hilary, no, don't hang up!
Hilary.
- Danny, what are we gonna do?
- This is unbelievable.
I'm going through all this in the back of a limo because of what went on in the back of my Jeep.
Wow, I got to get me a Jeep.
Look, Danny, can you do me, like, one real big favor?
- Sure, what is it?
- Please don't have this baby now!
Relax.
Relax.
I took the classes.
I read the books.
I can handle it, yeah.
I can't take it!
I can't take it!
I can't take it!
Help!
Sorry, buddy, there ain't no doctor out here.
Hey, man, I don't need a doctor, I need an exorcist.
Will, there's a bottle of Dom Perignon over in the bar over there.
Get it.
I don't think so, Danny.
You seem like you might be kind of a mean drunk.
I don't want to drink it.
I want you to smack me over the head with it!
- What?
- Just until I pass out.
This baby's on its way, and I think it's bringing luggage.
It can't be on its way now.
You've only been in labor for 10 minutes.
Tell him.
He's coming!
- Get out of my way.
- Wait, Danny, where are you going?
If I run really fast I can get back to the Forum and have my baby on the floor - of a ladies' room with some dignity.
- Wait, Danny, wait.
Hold on.
All right, you win.
Where's that champagne bottle?
Yo, guess who?
Not now, man.
We got an emergency in here.
Hence, Dr. Finkelbaum.
- Hey, you a doctor, man?
- Yeah.
I love you, man.
I love you.
Move.
So what seems to be the problem here?
I broke a nail.
What the hell do you think?
- Lie back.
- Just relax, Danny.
He's here to help you.
Hey, Tone, what took you so long?
I was looking for a doctor, and I found an M.D. License plate.
I yanked the guy out of his car, and then I realized M.D. Stands for Mike Ditka.
Fortunately, the car he threw me up against belonged to Dr. Finkelbaum, here.
- Is this the lady having a baby?
- Yeah.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Right this way, man.
We got some sodas in the fridge.
I called him from Finkelbaum's car.
I called him from Ditka's car.
Come on in.
We got some brews, a little bit of Malt Duck.
Get this kid out of me.
I got to make a phone call.
I suddenly miss my mother.
Danny, thanks for a wonderful evening.
I'll call you.
Oh, no, Will, don't leave me.
All right, Danny.
I'll stay here, and I'll help you focus.
Focus?
I don't want to focus.
I want drugs!
Now, get out in that parking lot and score!
Here we go.
It's Danny, isn't it?
Bear down.
Danny, think of it as the World Series, all right?
All right, Alomar is rounding third.
Here comes the throw.
- Slide, Danny, slide.
- Here comes your baby, Danny.
Push!
Here you are, Danny.
A beautiful healthy boy.
You want to hold him?
No.
No, thanks.
I'll wait till somebody run him through a car wash or something.
- Come here, man.
- Yeah, calm him down.
Get busy.
Put your thing down.
It's your birthday.
It's been one hell of a night, huh, Danny?
And, look, I went and saved the best for last.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Yo, yo, yo.
Anybody home?
Shabba!
Get off me, man.
Uncle Phil, what are you doing sleeping on the couch?
My chiropractor recommended it.
As you know, Will, I have a separation in my lower lumbar area - and the couch is perfect to align my - She threw you out, huh?
You got that right.
- Hear you had a pretty full night, too, huh?
- Oh, man.
Uncle Phil, I got to tell you, when Danny went into labor, man - I was trying to get the heck out of there.
- I heard that.
But then it was, like All of a sudden, it was a little alive wiggly thing, you know?
Ten fingers, and ten toes, and everything.
It was so small.
I was the first person the baby saw, you know, upside down.
- Sounds like quite an experience, Will.
- It was.
I'm gonna go give Danny a call at the hospital.
See how little Jackie Robinson Mitchell is doing, huh?
- Good night, Uncle Phil.
- Good night, Will.
Well, bet you feel like a big dope, huh?
Vivian, I made a decision.
I really want to be in the room when you give birth.
Not just because you want me there but because I want to be the first person our baby sees upside down.
Philip, that's a beautiful thing to say.
But, I'm afraid, honey, that I'm gonna have to kill you, anyway.
No, Viv.
No, Vivian!
And, look, I went and saved the best for last.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Well, Will, I pressed 180 today.
Eat your heart out.
Way to go, Arnold Schwarzenegro.
You know, I've had it up to here with you.
Right now, me and you, mano a mano.
Let's go.
Come on.
- You're on.
- Go.
Come on, Carlton, you can't keep moping around like this forever.
I mean, it's not like you and Paula just broke up yesterday, man.
You've had the whole weekend to get over it.
Will, sometimes you're so insensitive.
Love isn't something you can just turn on and off.
Carlton, I still think you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion, man.
Now, I've seen Paula, and I don't see what the attraction was.
What are you talking about?
She's a beautiful, intelligent girl with a dynamite body.
Yeah, I know.
I don't see what attracted her to you.
These are jokes, man.
You gotta loosen up.
You gotta have some fun.
You gotta do something or go someplace that gets her off your mind.
It's impossible.
Everywhere I turn, I see something that reminds me of her.
Something we've shared together, a patch of grass, a beach blanket, a swing.
Maybe you should go to bed.
Vivian, why are you making such a big deal about this?
- I say we do it right here, right now.
- Oh, good, a floor show.
Geoffrey, this envelope contains Mrs. Banks' sonogram.
It's gonna tell us whether or not the baby is a boy or a girl.
- How can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
- Ashley, you are so naive.
If it's a boy, it's blue.
Come on, I think it's time for another woman-to-woman talk.
Okay, what do you want to know this time?
Hilary's not planning on having kids, is she?
Philip, I am not looking at this sonogram.
It'll take away the excitement in the delivery room.
Honey, half the thrill is finding out.
All right, then, it's settled.
We don't want to know.
Of course, in the delivery room, I'm going to be too busy screaming.
Okay, I want to know.
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
Here.
Now this is exactly why the doctor changed his number on us, Vivian.
Now for the last time, do you want to know or don't you?
- No.
- Fine, then I'll take the envelope.
I'm not going to open it.
I promise.
Trust me.
Aunt Viv, I don't think so.
See, this is the same dude that said a squirrel ate that six-pack of Milky Ways.
I think Geoffrey should hold onto it.
Fine, and don't give it to us.
- No matter how much we insist.
- Got it?
I think I can handle that.
I got dressed all by myself this morning.
I feel good about this, Philip.
I think we're doing the right thing, don't you?
Yes, I agree, baby.
We're doing the right thing.
Uncle Phil?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure, Will.
What is it?
Look, a friend of mine has a little problem.
And, you know, I was wondering - since you're a judge and everything - I am not reducing bail.
No, Uncle Phil, no.
See, that's not See, check it out.
Now, this friend of mine knows this squaw that he's completely in love with, right?
But this particular squaw just broke up with his best friend.
Now he don't want to diss his boy or nothing like that, right but he wants to know how long is a good time to wait before he raids this squaw's village, if you know what I'm saying.
Interesting you should bring that up.
I had a case like that come before me just recently.
- Really?
- Word up.
Now this guy started going out with his best friend's girl hours after they broke up.
He waited that long?
Well, this other guy didn't think it was that long.
He was very jealous, and he shot his friend.
Dead?
No.
Let's just say he's two olives short of a martini.
So before your friend starts raiding any villages he better be sure it's worth it.
Hey, Paula.
How're you doing?
It's Will.
Look, about our date tonight I'll rock your world.
- Geoffrey, is Mrs. Banks around?
- I believe I believe she's in the study.
- Shall I get her?
- No!
No, you do too much running around, as it is.
I hate having you run and do everything.
- Mr. Banks, have you been drinking?
- Of course not.
You know, and I'd feel a lot better if you started calling me Phil.
And I'd feel a lot better if you'd wash your own underthings.
Look, Geoffrey now I know Mrs. Banks and I made you promise not to show us that sonogram but, look, I've got to know whether the baby is a boy or a girl and I can make it worth your while.
- How does a $100 sound?
- Like one hell of a night in Tijuana.
Philip Banks, you really should be ashamed of yourself.
- Bribing Geoffrey with a $100.
- I'll say.
At least she offered me $200.
Hello?
Hi, Paula.
Carlton's not here.
Well, who'd you want to talk to?
Just a second.
It's for you.
It's Paula as in Carlton's ex-girlfriend, Paula.
Gee I wonder why she want to talk to me.
Maybe I should just find out.
Hey, Paula, how're you doing?
Hey, I'm really looking forward to tonight, so we can work on some homework.
Yeah, but you should probably get some rest.
We might have to pull an all nighter.
Talk to you later.
Will, dating Carlton's ex behind his back isn't nice.
Ashley's right.
If Carlton finds out, he may never speak to you again.
Maybe you're on to something.
Hold it.
First, look, number one Carlton is not even dating this girl no more.
Okay?
Number two, I ain't see no rings on her fingers.
Okay?
And number three, Denise got it going on.
Paula.
You're right.
I hope that doesn't happen tonight.
Boy, that Paula's really bad news.
First, she dumps me.
Now you know what she did?
No.
Will, do you know?
No, I don't know nothing.
I'm just a poor black man trying to make it in Bel-Air.
She gave me the flu.
Wait, come on, look on the bright side, Carlton.
Most girls don't give you nothing.
- Hi, baby, how was school?
- Mommy, I don't feel so good.
- I think I got the flu.
- That's too bad, baby.
Get out of the house.
You know, we're getting more and more like the Jackson family every day.
Sweetheart, you know I love you but being pregnant, I cannot take a chance of getting sick.
Now shoo.
But where will I go?
Well, I guess you'll have to move into the pool house.
The pool house?
Daddy, I live in the pool house.
And there's no way I'm giving it up for Carlton.
You want to start paying rent?
I can be out in an hour.
Will, I am not through with you.
What you're doing is despicable.
And what you're doing is annoying.
Leave me alone.
Gesundheit.
Will, just a week ago, she was Carlton's girlfriend.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Yes, Ashley, it means she's having a better week.
Well, Carlton's going to put two and two together.
First, Paula had the flu, then Carlton had the flu and now you have the flu.
Ashley, I think you're giving Carlton too much credit.
I mean, come on, he thinks X is the movie about Malcolm-Jamal Warner's fight for freedom.
Very funny, guys.
Why don't you stop spinning?
Who moved the refrigerator all the way over there?
How are you feeling, Carlton?
Remember the Star Trek where the insect bored its way through the guy's brain?
- Yeah.
- That'd feel kind of good right now.
Okay, Will, I'm on to you.
Hey, look, Carlton, man, I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm not stupid, Will.
It's all coming together.
The runny nose, the watery eyes.
You just couldn't keep your hands to yourself.
Look, Carlton, now I know you're sick.
You're probably a little delirious.
You probably had one too many of them children's aspirins or something, man.
- That piece was mine.
- You ain't got to get all nasty.
Well, you shouldn't have done it, Will.
I know, Carlton.
I'm sorry, man.
I shouldn't have taken Paula out.
You're right, man, but she was coming on to me.
I couldn't resist, man.
Paula?
I was talking about that last piece of cheesecake.
Yeah, so was I. No, see, you don't know about it.
See, you ain't hip to it, right?
In Philly, we name our food, right?
See, like cheesecake is Paula, right?
And a Snack Pack is Boomshika.
I can't see him.
You can.
Is he buying it?
You backstabbing, girlfriend-stealing, piece of rubbish.
Did you really expect me to believe you name your food?
Look, Carlton, I'm telling you, man, it ain't how it seems, man.
Then you didn't go out with my girlfriend behind my back?
Okay, that's exactly how it seems.
But, look, man, I didn't do it for me.
I did it for you.
I did it to save you from something terrible.
As soon as I figure it out, I'll let you know what it is.
Every time you've tried to hurt me, I've turned the other cheek.
Well, I've run out of cheeks.
Carlton, man, what are you trying to say?
I'm trying to say that I can't trust you anymore.
Look, we're no longer family.
We're through.
Fini.
It's over.
Look, Carlton, you don't mean that.
You'll get over it, man.
Oh, yeah?
- Carlton, who are you calling?
- Your mother.
I know he ain't calling my mother.
Aunt Vy, it's Carlton.
Call me when you get home.
No, Mom, don't call him.
I want to tell you how much I hate Will's guts.
He's lying, Mom.
He loves me.
No, I don't.
Your little slimer's stolen my girl.
Mom, you know Carlton never had no girl.
Well, I'm glad you're out having fun 'cause I have to stay here, 'cause God only knows what else he'll steal.
Give me the phone.
Get off!
Hey, Mom.
Thanks for the sweater.
Love you.
You've gone over the line.
Okay?
You don't never call a dude's mom.
So it's okay to steal a guy's girlfriend as long as you don't go tell his mommy about it.
No, this is serious, man.
Even in ancient times they would kill your cattle, they would burn your village and they would stone your family but they wouldn't never tell your mother, man.
"But I did it to save you "from something you don't know "and soon as I figure it out, I'll let you know".
That's it.
We're going to have to take this to the street, man.
Aunt Viv!
Now, listen, as long as you're staying in my home, you have to play by my rules.
No crumbs on the carpet, no hair in the sink and no dressing up in my clothes, Carlton.
- It was Halloween.
- You still haven't returned my bustier.
- What are you doing here?
- Look, man, I don't want to be here but I'm sick, and Aunt Viv won't let me stay in the house.
I think you have everything you need.
And now if you'll excuse me I'm going to spend a quiet evening with my radio and Madonna.
Look like you spending the evening with Little Richard.
Well, I don't care what Mom says.
You're not staying here.
Why don't you go stay with Paula?
- She asked.
Her parents wouldn't let me.
- She has parents?
She never introduced me to her parents.
She told me they were dead.
I really, really hate you.
I hate you, too.
Just get out of my bed, then.
Man, nice, firm mattress, just like the one at Paula's house.
First, you steal my woman, and now you steal my bed.
Look, man, let's get something straight right now.
I did not steal your woman.
I rescued her, and she thanked me over and over, and over All right, stop singing.
Over and over and over.
- Why don't you act like an adult?
- Why don't you look like one?
Well, obviously, there's no reasoning with you.
Look, you just stay on your side of the room, and I'll stay on mine.
Fine.
This is my side of the room.
Hey, that's not fair.
Guess I'll watch a little TV, seeing as how it's on my side of the room.
Yo, where's the remote?
- On my side of the room.
- Toss it here.
Whatever you say.
Go get it.
Make me.
Oh God, my eye!
Will, you okay?
Thank you for giving me the night off.
Can I get you anything else?
No, get out of here, you knucklehead.
Good night.
- Philip, I want that sonogram.
- Yes.
- There's nothing here or here.
- Well, it's got to be here.
We searched the whole house, Vivian.
Well, what if he's got it on him?
- Found it.
- You found the sonogram?
No, it's that little chocolate bunny from Easter.
- I've been looking all over for it.
- Philip, honey, at least take off the foil.
- My head is killing me.
- My throat hurts.
- Now my ears are ringing.
- Mine, too.
Hi, this is Hi/ary.
Roses are red, vio/ets are b/ue, /'m not in so so /eave a Hi, honey, it's Pau/a.
/ just heard you were sick.
My poor /itt/e baby.
This is a// my fau/t, isn't it?
- It's for me, man.
- No, it's not.
It's for me.
/ wish / cou/d be there with you.
/ bet / know how to make you fee/ better.
First, /'d nibb/e on your /eft ear, then /'d bite you on your neck.
Then /'d Oops.
There's my other /ine.
Hello?
Now look what you did, you idiot.
You made me miss her call.
That wasn't for you.
It was for me.
Carlton, give it up, man.
She dumped you.
I mean, you're like Prince Charles.
You got the royal flush.
I'm going to beat your butt.
Yeah, what are you going to do?
Jump up and bang your head against it?
- Come on, put your dukes up.
- Come on, boy.
And there's more where that came from.
Maybe not.
Hey, Carlton.
I'm going to do something that's totally outside of my nature and I'm gonna take Uncle Phil's advice.
You're gonna go play on the freeway?
No, man, I'm going to be straight up with you.
I'm going to tell you everything that happened between me and Paula.
First time you brought her over here, man, I thought she was so fine and I wanted y'all to break up.
That's very honest, Will, but I'm still mad.
I guess I'll have to live with it.
Wait, there's more.
- I told her you had tuberculosis.
- You what?
Honest, I don't know, man.
It just came to me.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe you did that.
I'm gonna dig way down deep inside and maybe, in time, I'll be able to forgive you.
Wait.
There's more.
I told her about your hand puppet.
You told her about Binky?
I'll kill you.
No, I won't.
I'm bigger than that.
I guess I'll be honest, too.
You remember when Letisha suddenly stopped calling you?
Yeah.
Well, I told her you worship Satan.
All right.
Fair is fair.
I'm a man.
I can live with that.
I can live with that.
Wait, there's more.
You notice how Ashley has been acting very funny around you lately?
Yeah.
Well, I told her you shave your legs.
- What kind of monster are you?
- Sorry, Will.
I was just feeling a little jealous of your relationship.
No, that's unforgivable.
That's totally unforgivable.
Wait, there's more.
- You remember your friend Jazz?
- Oh, my God, what did you do with Jazz?
You know that funky smell coming from the basement?
Psych.
This honesty thing feels great.
What do you say we tell Geoffrey why his citizenship never came through?
This smells delicious.
You've really outdone yourself, Mom.
- Great oatmeal, Mom.
- Thank you.
Aunt Viv, in keeping with this new honesty thing this stuff kind of tastes like dry wall with raisins in it.
And, Uncle Phil, you know you really shouldn't wear silk no more 'cause, like, when big folks wear silk Well, since we're all being honest with each other I'm bloody sick of the two of you going through my drawers.
Here's your envelope.
I hope you get what you want.
In keeping with all this honesty, I really want to see what we're having.
You mean this isn't oatmeal?
I want to know, too, Philip.
Okay, let's have a look at that sonogram.
- Oh, my God.
- What is it, a boy or girl?
This isn't a sonogram.
It's a bill for $25,000.
This baby's costing me a fortune.
Congratulations, you're having a Hilary.
Philip, you found the sonogram?
No, the little chocolate Easter bunny.
I've been looking at it y ou found the sonogram?
No, it's that little Easter chocolate bunny.
I've been looking for it all y ou found the sonogram?
No, it's that little chocolate bunny from Easter.
I've been looking at it all week.
/t's the /itt/e choco/ate Easter bunny!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Yo, what up, guys?
- Hey, Will.
- Master William.
Aunt Viv, I got the cake you wanted for the family reunion.
- Good.
- And guess what's in here?
It's round, it's rubber and you'll never use it.
Carlton, can we please keep your hand puppet out of this?
Look, it's a California's driver's license.
I think you're confused, Will.
You need a license to drive a car, not steal one.
I'm sorry, Carlton, I didn't understand you, I don't speak pygmy.
Diva!
Will, what do you think you're doing?
I'm practicing for when my mom and all my aunts get here.
I am so excited, Uncle Phil.
Aren't you excited?
No.
I hate family reunions.
- I always do all the work.
- Philip, that is not true.
Philip, this is not the kind of juice Vy drinks and Helen does not like this kind of bread.
I guess I will have to take it back to the store.
- No, no, no, let me do that.
- Great.
Would you pick me up a gallon of Rocky Road and some sardines.
And don't eat it all on the way home like you did last time.
- Look who we found.
- Diva!
Helen, oh, God!
Let me look at you.
Let me look at it, let me look at it.
- Oh, my God, Frank, how are you?
- I'm fine, how you doing?
Let me look at Frank, Jr. My goodness, where did you get those beautiful green eyes?
I'm guessing, the guy with no rhythm.
You mean Carlton?
Diva!
Whoa, whoa, think you could all come together next time?
- This is exhausting.
- Let me look at you all.
- Vivian, girl, you are glowing.
- Thank you.
That's 'cause she be spending a lot of time in front of the microwave.
Philip, that reminds me.
Would you pick me up some microwave popcorn, please?
You know, next time I'm going to get pregnant.
Well, you certainly have the pants for it.
Uncle Phil, if I would have said that I would have gotten smacked in my head.
Look at Little Frank.
Now that's the first time a man has smiled at me since my divorce.
Aunt Helen, I just want to say how sorry I am things didn't work out between you and Uncle Lester.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Do you think he'll still be sending me a gift for graduation?
How has he been acting since the divorce?
Awful.
I hate that man.
But I don't like to badmouth him without the kid around.
You know, it's like doing the work twice.
Where's Vy?
Now, she said she has some really big news.
You know, she told me the same thing.
Isn't it obvious?
Really big news?
She must be bringing me Grandma's diamond earrings.
I don't think so.
Do you like them?
Aunt Janice, I never got to know Grandma.
I'd really like to have something of hers.
Listen, honey, I have a beautiful silk handkerchief of Grandma's.
Yeah, like I really want some old lady's snot rag.
Well, she said it was something about Robert.
Now, ladies, this could be an engagement announcement.
- You know it could - Come on!
No!
Maybe the big news is something else.
Maybe she got cable.
Divas!
- Big Diva.
- Yeah.
Mom, it's a terrible idea marrying this Robert dude, it's a big mistake.
Baby, I'm not marrying Robert, we broke up.
- Vy, now come - That's the big news.
- My goodness.
- Yes.
All right.
- Honey, what happened, tell us.
- Yeah.
He just wanted more out of the relationship and I wasn't sure I could spend the rest of my life with him.
Amen.
- And, Will's never been too fond of him.
- No, Will was not.
So, in the long run it seemed like the best thing.
Well Hey, you know, Vy, I have a brother who's single.
Although, he's not a brother.
I mean he is a brother because he's my brother, but he's just not your kind of brother.
Oh, brother.
Help me, Will.
No, I think I'm going to stick with the black folks on this one.
- I love you so much, Mom.
- I love you, too, sweetie.
You know, it's great having you out here.
Especially without that Robert dude.
Getting all in our hair.
Trying like a damn fool to win me over.
You're not kidding, baby.
You know, for your graduation, he actually wanted to buy you a car.
- A car?
- Yeah.
I'm glad you dumped him anyway, Ma.
What kind of car he want to get me, Mom?
Okay, set everything on the island.
We'll use it tomorrow to serve.
Let me take that, Vivian, wouldn't want you to overexert yourself.
Philip, are you upset with me?
Vivian, for the past 48 hours, all I've heard is: "Philip, wash this.
Philip, dust that.
"Philip, push me up the steps, I'm pregnant".
As long as you're not upset with me.
Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal figurines.
It'll work wonders for your attitude.
Yes!
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, girl.
- You guys missed a great afternoon.
- So did you.
- We were down at the news station.
- We got to polish the silver.
Let me tell you, Hilary's the best weather girl I've ever seen.
Oh, yes.
She's beautiful.
She's poised.
She's articulate.
God, I'm really enjoying all of this, but please stop.
Okay.
Frank, honey, I think it's time to change Frank, Jr. Okay, babe.
You know what, you look a little tired.
Why don't you come and lay down - and I'll rub your feet for a little while.
- Thanks, baby.
That does it, I'm getting me a white man.
Girl, stop it.
No, just to help around the house a little bit.
Now, come on, you know you all were thinking it.
I'm never driving in a car with Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor again.
- Honey, what happened?
- They were blasting the radio sticking their heads through the sunroof, and yelling at other cars.
When they weren't doing that, they were making out.
I mean, when are those two going to grow up?
Honey, stop it.
Aunt Eleanor.
- Hey, get your own girl.
- Aunt Eleanor.
- Hi, Uncle Lou.
- Hi.
Look at you two.
- Gosh, you look like a couple of kids.
- You look like a couple of kids yourself.
You all got to remember, she carrying Uncle Phil's child.
Lou, I want to go up and freshen up.
Me, too.
See you all tomorrow.
Now, what does Aunt Eleanor have that I don't?
A horny husband.
This is just so great, my whole family under one roof.
You know, I just wish that we could all be together all the time.
Baby, at least you and I are going to be together in a few months.
Get the y ou moving to L. A?
No, silly, I'm talking about when you graduate high school and move back home.
It'll be just like old times, baby, just you and me.
We can do everything together.
I can hardly wait.
I've looked forward to this for so long.
And /'ve got so many things p/anned.
Hi, baby.
I came to tuck you in.
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot, Mom.
Can we talk about me moving back home?
You're excited, too, huh?
- Look, now that you mention it, Mom - Baby, I got your room fixed up so nice.
And keep your fingers crossed because I got a friend at U of P who thinks she might be able to pull some strings with your application.
Heck, with me working around the corner, we could have lunch together every day.
Every day.
I'll tell you, baby, these past few days with you have been so great - I haven't thought about Robert once.
- Really?
'Cause, yo, I've been thinking about him all the time.
You just get some rest, and we'll talk some more tomorrow.
I'll get it!
Hey, Al!
- How you doing, Mr. Smith?
- Hey, call me Will, man.
What you say, you take me down to one of them dance clubs you all be going to.
- Excuse me?
- Never mind, boy, I thought you was hip.
Get on out of my house.
Hey, girl.
How you doing with your fine self?
Why don't you slide on up here and let Big Daddy talk to you a little bit!
- You like that?
- Who's that out there, baby?
- It ain't nobody, Mama.
- Get your big old butt back in here then.
- Look here, Mom.
- What's that?
A letter from Carlton.
- And the boy sent a picture.
- Look at that, he look great.
And he's so tall.
Lord, who'd of thought he'd shoot up 12 inches in his freshman year.
"Dear Will, and Aunt Vy "enjoying a relaxing vacation with Miriah and the kids.
"It's great to be rich, hah, hah.
"Love, Carlton.
"P.S. It's really, really great to be rich.
"Hah, hah".
Isn't it nice to hear from Carlton?
Baby, why ain't you got on that leisure suit I laid out for you?
Because I'm a 72-year-old man still living with his mother.
And I'm tired of it, Mom.
I mean, I want to get married.
And I want to have some kids.
And I don't want nobody telling me what to wear.
I'm sorry.
You the man, you the man.
- About time I start treating you like one.
- You've got that right.
Can I have $10 to go to the movies?
Sure, baby.
Here you go.
Another dollar for some Gummy Bears.
You taking anybody special?
Harriet Jenkins.
You're spending my social security on Harriet Jenkins.
Look, Mama, I'm going to tell you, if you mess this date up for me - I'm moving out of here.
- Okay.
- I Swear.
- Okay.
You know, I was looking in the paper the other day and I saw Robert's picture.
Oh, Lord, here come Robert again.
You remember him, don't you, the man that proposed to me?
I remember.
- His wife dead yet?
- No.
Damn, got to use more dynamite next time.
Lord know, he a rich man.
Handsome, too.
Even hear he giving money to the church.
But I tell you one thing, baby I sure am glad that you talked me out of marrying him.
Okay, Ma, you win.
I'll cancel my date with Harriet.
Baby, you ain't got to do that.
You just put on that leisure suit.
I'll call Harriet.
I'm still half asleep, so don't nobody talk to me.
- Did the baby wake you up?
- Eleanor and Lou woke me up.
I swear that man's part jackhammer.
Lord, they didn't even eat this much at the Last Supper.
Well, I guess you old enough to remember.
Yeah, but I'm still young enough to kick your butt.
- What are you all doing up?
- Eating and talking about sex.
Personally, I prefer eating.
You don't have to wait an hour for seconds.
All right!
Well, Vy, tell me, what's the real deal between you and Robert?
- I wasn't in love with him.
- Girl, are you crazy?
That man had a business, a car and money.
Now, what's love got to do with it?
Can we just for once have a conversation without my name being mentioned?
Sure, Vy.
Why is a certain person ruining Will's life by moving him back to Philly?
Why doesn't a certain person stick a drumstick in her mouth and call it a day?
Wait a minute, now, Vy.
We all family here and we all care about Will.
Listen, do I tell you how to raise your son?
No, but I wish you would.
Vy, I really think Will had his heart set on going to school in California.
So this is how it is?
Once again my family has taken it upon themselves to decide that Vy don't know how to take care of her own.
No, you're wrong.
You're wrong.
And I'll thank all of you to keep your noses out of my personal affairs.
Okay, everybody, who's going to bless this table?
Come on, you all.
I think it ought to be the oldest, Vy.
I am not the oldest, Uncle Lou is.
He's young to me.
- Lou!
- Yes, yes, okay, okay.
All right.
Dear Lord, we thank you for bringing our family together.
Keep us safe and healthy so that we can come together again.
And, we thank Philip and Vivian for their hospitality - and their Jacuzzi.
- Amen.
Enjoying the reunion, Master William?
I don't know what to do, G. I mean I don't want to move back to Philly, but I don't want to let my mom down.
But then on the other hand, it's like I'm so terribly sorry, Master William, there's been a misunderstanding.
Apparently, I gave you the impression that I really wanted to know.
Where did Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor disappear to?
Oh, my God, are they at it again?
Those two are animals.
I was in the bathroom.
Get your minds out the gutter.
What?
Now, Will, about your moving back to Philly.
Yeah, I know, the sheets and bed linens stay here.
No, well, yeah.
No, what I was going to say was I hope that money wasn't a part of your decision because I'd be more than happy to help you with your tuition.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil but I need to be in Philly, you know, with my mom.
Whatever you decide, I just want you to know that I'm behind you 100o/o.
Thanks and it means a lot to me, Uncle Phil.
Good.
Okay, son.
Okay, Vivian, I told him everything you wanted me to now give me my piece of pie.
- Baby.
- Hey, what's up, Mom?
- I have a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
Yes, I got a great deal on a cruise and I am sending you to the Caribbean for your graduation.
- For real?
- Yes.
I always wanted to go to the Caribbean.
It'll be so great, baby.
We could go snorkeling and play shuffleboard.
We?
You going, too?
Well, sure, and it's not locked in yet but I think the entertainment is going to be the new Fifth Dimension.
I love them, take me.
Take me.
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, you smell like broccoli.
- What's the matter?
- Ma, this is great.
We need to talk and Look, it can't wait.
We got to talk about this right now.
Well, I hate to say I told you so.
I know what you all are thinking.
But you're wrong.
Now, Will is looking forward to moving back to Philly.
Aren't you, baby?
Look what the wind did to my hat.
Ma, can you help me go find it, please?
- Will, what's going on?
- Look, Mom, it's We were just - Somebody should fix this light here.
- Yeah, there's some things broken.
The light, yeah.
Walk with me, talk with me, Mom.
- All right, look, check it out.
- Spit it out.
- All right, see, I was - Baby, whatever it is, I will understand.
I know, you'll understand and I'll be on my way to the emergency room.
Will, just say it.
- Mom, I don't want to move back home.
- How can you say that?
Baby, when I sent you out here, it was only on a temporary basis.
I always expected you to come back home.
So did I, Mom.
And, I know I was tripping when I first came out here 'cause you were right, I needed to be out here.
And I still need to be out here.
You know, it's given me a head start so I can break out on my own.
What about college?
You know I can't afford to send you to an out-of-state school.
I know, Ma, but, look, I was hoping I could get a scholarship or a loan, and Uncle Phil said he'd help me.
And, if that doesn't work, I'll get a job I'll get two jobs, but please, don't make me move back home, Mommy.
Obviously, you've given this a lot of thought, huh?
But I'll be honest with you, I still want you to come home.
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too, Mom.
Look, but I'll visit.
Every Christmas.
And every Easter.
And whatever else of them holidays it'd take to get that evil look out your face.
Well, it sounds like you made up your mind.
So I guess I have to respect your decision.
You do?
I mean, you do!
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too, baby.
As much as I hate to admit it, your aunts were right and I was wrong.
But don't you dare tell them, you hear me?
- Someone should fix this light here.
- Yeah.
Someone should fix this light.
Your secret's safe with me.
Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal fusiliers.
Do you know what a fusilier is?
A fusilier, a crystal fusilier.
They must got them in London.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Okay, here we go.
Put down your money, find the honey.
Locate the black queen, and I don't mean Little Richard.
There!
Okay, Carlton, you're pretty good for a white guy.
- What's going on out here?
- I'm cleaning up, Geoffrey.
I hope they pay you more than they pay me.
Seriously, Geoffrey, you should get in on this.
Do you play the Hell's Kitchen version or the A-train hybrid.
- I'm in.
- All right, here we go.
Zagnut, Goobers, Good & Plenty, locate the black girl, you win $20.
That one.
Yes!
Well, there goes Saturday night at Sizzler.
I had coupons, too.
Beginner's luck, Master William.
- One last bet?
- No, no, thanks.
I'm out, G. Didn't realize you were such a coward.
Chicken.
All right, don't nobody call me a coward.
- What's your bet?
- $50.
I ain't no punk, I'll take that down.
Here we go.
I can't look.
- Drat!
- Damn.
Oh, damn, G. Damn!
There, see, that one red.
See, if it was like you, you'd have won, but it red, so you lost.
Better luck next time.
He fell for it, Will.
Now let's go hustle Dad.
- Oops.
- "Oops"?
Good cover.
I'm guessing you've done this before?
You're wasting your time, Carlton.
Geoffrey already cut out all the bra ads.
Will, for your information, I was looking at those funny little markings underneath the pictures.
In Bel-Air we call them "words".
Guess what, I just finished my first short story.
What a coincidence, your first short story and your first short son in the same room.
My friend at Essence magazine offered to read it.
But, before she does, I wanted to give you a copy and I want you to tell me exactly what you think.
Great, I can't wait to read it.
Well, now that I am a professional I'm gonna go check out that new word processor.
- See you.
- That's my little writer.
Okay, somebody bury this.
Dad, are you crazy?
If I read this story, it'll be the biggest mistake I've ever made.
I don't know about that, Uncle Phil.
Remember them plaid shorts you wore last summer?
Look, let me tell you boys something about women.
Now, if I read it and say I like it she'll think I'm just trying to make her happy.
If I say I don't like it, she'll stop trying to make me happy.
Yes, women is a trip, Uncle Phil.
It's just like, let's say you accidentally scream out the wrong name and they jumping all out the back of your car like that.
So, what are you going to do, Dad?
- Well, hey, I'm the man of the house.
- Yeah.
- What do you think I'm gonna do?
- What a man would do.
Buy her a car and hope she forgets all about this.
You know, we can really learn a lot from that man.
- Hey, G, would you make me a sandwich?
- But, of course.
Now you're a sandwich.
You can take it off your head.
- G, something wrong?
- You swindled me.
I was planning to use that money on lottery tickets.
The jackpot's up to $26,000,000.
Wow!
Could you imagine what life would be like with all that money?
Buying whatever you want, driving fancy cars dining in fancy restaurants.
Wait a second, that is what life is like.
I see this is getting me nowhere.
Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to enjoy the one thing you can't spoil for me.
I don't know, Will.
I mean, Geoffrey works hard for his money.
- Yeah.
- You know, we have so much and he has so little.
- Well, now we'll have more.
- Yeah, absolutely.
Let's p/ay Brainstorm.
Fe/ix, /'// take Famous Quotes for $100.
The question is, "What is the motto of The Three Musketeers"?
That's an easy one.
"Creamy on the inside, smooth on the outside".
- "A// for one and one for a//"!
- Right again.
I can't believe you missed that one, G. Yeah, even Will could have guessed that one and the only thing he reads is the cereal box.
Yeah, well, at least I don't fit in one.
Well, if you're so confident in my lack of ability perhaps you'd like to make a little wager.
- Say, $30?
- Done.
Vietnam for $200.
You drew the wi/d card.
What do you say, Geoffrey?
Want to double your bet?
Well, it is an awful lot of money but, what the hell.
And the question is.
' "Who is the South Vietnamese president ki//ed by his own genera/s in 1963"?
Ngo Dinh Diem.
No guesses?
The correct answer is Ngo Dinh Diem.
Splendid.
I say we call Immigration.
Is this Brainstorm?
How sad.
Some people will do anything for money.
I mean, why don't they just ask their fathers?
The category is Greek History.
And the fina/ Brainstorm question is.
' "What Bronze Age civi/ization emerged about 2500 BC"?
Oh, I know, the Minoan civilization.
- The Minoan civi/ization?
- Correct.
Hold up, hold up.
Time out.
Flag on the plate, traveling, offsides, clipping.
Hold up, wait a minute.
- What's up with this here?
- Hilary, how'd you know that?
Easy, Geoffrey's been watching that tape all day.
Well, I'm off to the store.
When you're through, do turn off the VCR and return that tape of Brainstorm to my room.
And might I add, ha ha!
And, ha!
- Carlton, come on, come on.
- Okay, okay.
I wonder what Geoffrey uses that cape for.
Just Give me the lottery ticket.
All right, watch the door.
- Are you sure we should do this?
- Look, come on, man.
He got our money.
I mean, it's either this or force him to listen to y oko Ono albums.
Boys, your mother is driving me crazy about reading that short story.
Gee, Dad, why don't you just read it and get it over with?
I did read it.
Trust me, the only thing your mother should write is checks.
So, if she asks where I am, you haven't seen me and I'm not at home.
- But, Uncle Phil - No "buts," Will.
No matter what she says, you haven't seen hide nor hair of me.
Hi, sweetheart.
How long have you been there?
You read it.
You read it and you hated it.
No, I lost it.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
And I was so looking forward to reading it.
Oh, well, that's okay 'cause, you know, I made an extra copy.
Here.
- And I want you to be honest.
- I will.
Oh, check it out.
The lottery numbers are coming on!
Turn it up.
Turn it up.
Why, Geoffrey, do you have a ticket in today's drawing?
And this week's SuperLotto numbers are.
' Sixteen.
Twenty-two.
- Three.
- Oh, my!
- Forty-one.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Twe/ve.
- Yes!
Please, God.
Fifteen.
Fifteen, please.
And the /ast number for the $26,000,000 jackpot fifteen!
I'm rich!
I'm rich!
Did someone say "rich"?
Hey!
I don't care how much money you got, brother, you ain't gonna What's going on in here?
And don't tell me I'm too young to know because I'm sick of it.
My friends, this calls for a drink.
- This is incredible.
- I'll say.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, now, that's a $500 bottle of champagne.
Ah, the cheap stuff.
Not to worry, Phil.
It's on me.
Geoffrey, check it out.
Me and Carlton y our Montrose vase attracts dust like a magnet.
G, listen Problem solved.
- Okay, G, listen, listen.
- Philip I have $1,000 with your name on it.
Do the family a favor, get Viv some cooking lessons.
You And, Miss Ashley, how does a Mercedes sound?
Vroom, vroom?
Very clever, I'll get you two.
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
Nice try.
In case you hadn't figured it out I quit.
I quit.
Will, Mom and Dad are gonna kill us when they find out what we did.
No, they're not, 'cause they're not gonna find out what we did.
Geoffrey's not leaving because I'm going to do the right thing.
- What, tell the truth?
- No, I'm gonna beg like Keith Sweat.
Money.
Money.
Will, do something.
Will!
You can keep the tape.
I'm buying the O'Jays.
Look, G we've known each other, you know, a long time, right?
We certainly have.
My God!
All these years.
All these memories.
How do you say goodbye?
Like this: "Goodbye".
Goodbye.
Geoffrey, you remember when you came to us and you had no money and nowhere to go?
Yes!
Well, some things never change.
Am I missing something?
Yeah, about $26,000,000.
Will did it.
Did what?
We tricked you into thinking you won, G. What you just watched was a tape of last week's lottery numbers.
How clever.
You used my own ruse against me.
How I admire you.
Die!
Geoffrey, you're killing him.
You catch on quickly, you little twit.
G, listen, I said we're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I must not have heard you.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Look, G. It's going to be all right, man.
Uncle Phil will give you your job back.
What about the money?
There is no money.
I see.
I have no choice but to leave.
I made such a fool of myself.
I shudder to think what I said to your parents.
It's all right, G. Come on, man.
I'm too humiliated to stay.
- But, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, you can't go.
- Come on, G. It was a joke, man.
Will, what are we gonna do?
Look, I don't know about you, man, but I'm going to take this TV right here.
Hey, grab that radio, drop it off in my room for me.
You did what?
Are you out of your horny, little adolescent minds?
I know I am, Dad.
What you did was not only humiliating it caused Geoffrey to quit his job.
Look, Uncle Phil, it was just a joke.
A joke I had nothing to do with, Dad.
I mean, you know me, I don't even have a sense of humor.
You two have pulled some pranks in your day but this one, this one takes the cake.
He's about to blow, man.
Make a break for the front door.
I'll cover you.
- So.
- So.
Tell me, if you were me, what would you do?
I don't know, forget the whole thing and get us a couple Jet Skis.
I like that.
Look, you big-eared freeloader you take the little, square-headed cousin, here and you find Geoffrey and you bring him back or they'll never find your bodies.
And, I'm a judge.
I can make it happen.
You know, really, I don't mind the yelling.
But does he have to spit?
This happens all the time.
They think I'm Bryant Gumbel.
Are you the guy from Webster?
No.
I told you it was the guy from Diff'rent Strokes.
So, Bryant, are you sure this the restaurant Hilary said G was working at?
- What are you two nimrods doing here?
- I'm pretty sure.
Look, G. Come on, man, we want you to come home with us.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
All right, G, we made a mistake, okay.
What, are you going to hold a grudge forever?
How about until I'm dead?
Geoffrey, you can't let something like this come between us.
Look, I want you to leave.
I finally found a position where I'm respected and appreciated.
Geoffrey, the urinals need mints.
Move it.
Inside joke.
You wouldn't understand.
- Look, I don't think it's going to work, Will.
- Keep hope alive.
Hey, my man!
Look, check it out, me and my partner, here, we need a table preferably by the window.
Now.
Who are you?
Who am I?
You hear Who am I?
I'm a black man with a short fuse.
Geoffrey, show them to the table.
Show us to the table.
- Eat fast and get out.
- We're not leaving without you.
Look, G, come on, everybody misses you.
Well, get used to it.
I can't go back.
- You humiliated me.
- Geoffrey, we've all been humiliated.
Yeah, how do you think Carlton feels when he changes into his gym shorts?
That's a very small humiliation.
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
Waiter.
If I don't get something to drink soon, I'm gonna die.
You promise?
Will, I don't think he's going to come with us.
Don't worry, baby.
Plan B. Say, Miss, check it out, look me and my partner can't afford nothing on this menu.
Probably, a Vaseline and salt sandwich if they had one.
Check it out, I'll give you $5 for that salad.
- What?
- All right, $6.50.
Wait, check it out, $7 for just the lettuce.
Well, I never.
All this money he paying for this food, girl, you better.
- What?
What's up?
What's up?
What?
- I'm so sorry.
You're embarrassing me.
Well, you know what you have to do to get rid of us.
I know you're trying to get me fired, but it won't work.
Just leave.
Oh, my God!
What, are you blind?
Your table's on fire.
Pay attention.
- You idiot!
- What is going here?
Should I tell him?
Or do you want to, Dad?
- This is your son?
- Of course not.
Is it our fault you never married Mom?
I know she embarrassed you.
She only had one arm and when you would go to concerts, she clapped like this.
Surely, you don't believe this.
Daddy, you're ashamed of us?
This is my brother, Carlton.
He knows we can't afford any bigger clothes so he just doesn't grow.
Daddy, I want to grow.
He's never even been on a roller coaster for God's sakes.
You two are really something.
Something good or something bad?
I can't believe you'd go through all this to get me back.
We miss you.
We love you, Dad.
All right.
I'll come back home.
Daddy's coming home.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you.
Daddy's coming Thank you.
Daddy's coming home.
You so crazy.
/'m crazy about you, gir/.

I hate rejections, as a matter of fact I wrote a book of poetry about it.
Mr. Devens.
I find it difficult to believe that you put forth in honest effort to find employment.
I'm willing to take any kind of job your Honor.
I'm good with my hands, I can fix paractical anything.
Then why are you unemployed.
I'm a ex-con nobody wants to hire an ex-con.
Oh please, thats a very lame execuse Mr. Devens.
Are you aware that I am perfectly within my rights to send you back to prison.
Yo Uncle Judge.
Uncle Phil you could give him a job.
Are you crazy he's and ex-con.
Come on Uncle Phil all that stuff that's broken round the house.
Plus I'm telling you I got a good feeling about this guy, look at him.
I don't think that would work Will.
Uncle Phil, remember what your pap said it is better to give then recive.
I really really hate you.
Love you to Uncle Phil.
Yo check it out G ma Willy Maze just went up again, I can get 300 spankies for this.
And when you finsh mowing the lawn you can prown Mrs. Banks roses.
My pleasure.
I have a date tonight would you mind washing the car.
Oh and can you jack up the drivers seat a little.
And can you pick up my dress from the dry-cleaners.
And while your at it could you type up your thoughts on the Industrial Revolution double space and put my name on it.
You drible and you shoot you know you hope for the best.
I'll take care of everything right away and thanks again for the work.
Hey, there's more where that came from.
What a great guy.
Incredable.
Dude got it going on I mean expecal after spending 5 years in the PEN.
The PEN?
Please tell me that slang for The Valley.
Don't everybody over react but he did surve some time for burguly.
Are you out of your damn mindAshley!
Oh my god I got to make myself look less atractive.
I know I'll put on something of mom's.
I'm nailing down all of my dolls right now.
Me to.
Hold it!
Now the man has paid his dept of society.
Yeah.
He deserves a second chance like everybody else.
Who's idea was this.
His.
Will you have put this entire family in danger.
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.
Will your are a genius.
Luthur is a godsend, he fix all the bulbs in my Venotie Mirror.
I'm even prettier then I thought.
You know Hilary I don't think it's possible to be prettier then you thought.
Thank you Will.
Yo Will I fixed that T.V. in your room.
Oh by the way you now get the Playboy channel.
My man.
I don't know Will.
I don't think I'll leave a convicted fellow alone in my room.
But what could you have possible of any value.
What you talking about man.
How about for instance my Willy Maze baseball.
Look at the time.
4 o'clock already, better get some sleep.
Where's my Willy?
Carlton I can't find my Willy!
Carlton tell me that there's a baseball in this thing.
There's no baseball Will.
I guess you wasn't listening.
Carlton tell me that there's a baseball in this thing!
It's gone.
Will, Luther's a thief.
What are we gonna do.
We don't know Luther did it.
Come of it Will.
If it looks like duck smells like a duck and sounds like a duck what is it.
Your prom date.
I told you she had a cold.
Look if your so sure Luther didn't take it why don't you just ask him.
He won't have anything to hide.
Come on Carlton you can't just walk up to people and acuse them off stuff.
You think he did it, you ask him.
Oh right, like I'm going to march up to a vicious harded criminal and say "Hey Mister Can I Have My Ball Back And Please Don't Snap My Neck Like A Twig" Will, you have to be clever to out think the criminal mind.
Hey Luthur.
I'll find out if he's honest.
Hey Luthur you dropped your wallet.
No thats yours.
So it is.
How honest of you to say so.
So Luthur, baseball is a fine game isn't it?
Oh yeah.
Carlton, can I have a word with you?
Sure.
The word is "Idiot" man, can't you see he's innocent?
Well I'm going to buy my self some lumber I want to get started on that trellis.
Good for you Luthur, nice talking to you Luthur, your doing a darn good job Luthur.
Great having you abord Luthur.
Thanks.
See you Luthur.
Luthur's guilty Will, I'm going to tell dad.
No your not man, cause if you do I'm gonna tell him about those calls you been making to one-nine-hundred horney.
You wouldn't?
Come on boys lets go out to dinner.
Out?
We can't go out.
We got lots of food right here, we can't leave the house our stuff is here.
Carlton, Jeffory's away mom's gone, if we don't go out to eat we'll starve.
Come on lets celebrate, it's not everyday that will does something right.
Luthur's a good worker.
Good thing he worked out or I'd have to take it out of your hide.
That would be nasty wouldn't it?
Come on boys lets go.
Will we got to tell dad about Luthur he might be dangerous.
Carlton please, the man is innocent.
Trust me.
What happened in here.
We was robbed.
Oh my god, what they take.
I knew it.
I told you we shouldn't have left Luthur here.
Luthur did this?
Will dad's gonna kill you.
Why?
No he's not.
First of all we don't even know that Luthur did this.
Second of all Uncle Phil's a fair man he can blame me for none of this.
Will I'll kill you.
Uncle Phil this ain't my fault man.
I don't believe this.
"Why Don't You Give Him A Job Uncle Phil".
"I Got A Good Feeling About Him Uncle Phil".
Look Uncle Phil I'm telling you there's probably a perfectly good explanation for this.
Like what?
Maybe Luthur took all our stuff to get his scotch guarded.
It could happen.
Shut up!
Any idiot could see he's guilty.
I'm calling the police.
My Tevin Campbell posters.
If he's touched them I will hunt him down like a dog.
Wait a minute, lets just calm down here.
What did he lose for real.
A bunch of things.
Were all healthy.
Were all safe.
Were all the video games?
Alright I can't breathe.
Well he got all the T.V.s. He got all the silverwear too.
Feel like such a fool.
He was probably planning this from day one.
Don't blame yourself big guy, blame will.
He should have told you when Luthur stole his baseball.
What baseball?
What Baseball?
Baseball Game With A Man With Stick Hit Ball And Run.
Something Like This.
Hold it!
You mean to tell me that Luthur stole your Willy Maze and you didn't tell me about it.
I didn't really know Uncle Phil.
If we want to be serious about this, this is all your fault.
Excuse Me!
If you had let me go to the beach, then none of this would have never happened.
Will, I will give you to the count of 10 to get out of my sight.
Nine!
Luthur get on my nerves, steals my stuff and I get in trouble.
I wish that punk was in here right now, boy cause I'd scream like a girl, Uncle Phil!
Luthur's in the house.
Yeah you right, Dig Me With My Bad Self.
The hell are you doing here?
Let me warn you Luthur I've called the police!
You got a lot of damn nerve coming back here after you robbed us.
What are you talking about?
Oh please!
If this wall wasn't in my way mister you'd be plenty sorry.
After we gave you a second chance this is how you repay us.
I did not rob you, you got to believe me.
Will you believe me, right?
Its people like you who give ex-cons a bad name.
Am calling the police man.
Damn!
That was fast.
They must have thought we were white folk.
-Come on in officer.
-Thank you.
Thank god you got here when you did, I was about to turn this sucker out.
Officer I want you to arrest this man, he stole my baseball and some other stuff.
-I can't do that Sir.
-Why not.
We already arrested the perpetrader.
His name Edward Haskel.
Claims to be your law perk.
Edward, officer there must be some kind of mistake.
Oh am afraid not Sir, see we say his Uhall double parked.
Pon suggesting he moved the vehicle.
Suspect broke down and confessed to cleaning you out Sir.
Why would he wanna rob me?
Well acording to him "He's sick and tired of getting you Bagels".
"It's not his job to iron your Robes.
And he said you unfairly accused him of calling one-nine-hundred horney.
The man is obvously a deviant.
Thank you officer, I'll meet you down at the station to make a positive I.D. Luthur.
Luthur, were sorry we were wrong.
Tell me about it.
Luthur, sorry someone in my possition should be a better judge of charcter I'd like for you to continue to work for us.
Well after working i this house, jail wont be so bad.
See you.
Well I trust we all learnt somehing from this.

But don't worry I cleaned it off for you.
Where are those damn ?

?
posters.
No!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
You know, I used to think the only reason to kill a man was self-defense but I just spent 45 minutes in the Volvo with another reason.
- What's wrong with him?
- This idiot is taking a mime class.
Carlton, get I swear to God, Carlton, get away from me with this.
Stop.
Stop playing.
Carlton, stop or I'll hang you with that rope!
All right, that's it.
That's it.
I was going to throw him out on the freeway but you know the old saying: A mime is a terrible thing to waste.
Now we are entering the kitchen.
This is where we eat.
Some of us more than others.
And this is your mommy and she look like she eating for a couple of brothers herself.
Will, what are you doing with that microphone?
Making a tape for the coming attraction.
You know, I was going to knit some booties or something but you know, I had to get yarn and needles and I'd have had to learn how to knit.
See, look, Uncle Phil, the concept is to aesthetically capture for posterity the sounds that are familiar to this house.
Will, I'm eating.
- You'll hear a lot of that.
- You're grounded.
Okay, that about sums up Uncle Phil.
Yo, G, what sound do you think accurately depicts your position in the family?
You're sick, man.
See a therapist, okay?
Hey, Ashley, say something to the baby.
- Care to elaborate?
- A lot.
Don't feel bad.
She just mad 'cause she found out she ain't adopted.
So Mom's having a baby.
Big deal.
I bet you didn't go through all this for me.
You probably smoked cigarettes and rode horseback until the day I was born.
Ashley, honey, come on, we prepared for you and took the same precautions as we did for Hilary and Carlton.
Bungee jumping.
Philip, the baby's moving, feel my stomach.
Hey, I move all the time.
Let's have a party.
All you guys do is talk about the baby.
The baby's clothes, the baby's room.
The baby, baby, baby.
You'll forget all about me after you have it, Mommy.
I can see it coming.
Good morning, Geoffrey.
Morning, everybody.
Geoffrey, my place isn't set, and where's my food?
Let me feed my favorite little cousin.
- Oh, now, come on.
- Oh, I thought it was my turn.
I thought I was your favorite cousin.
What do I have to do, spit up on your shirt?
Y'all hear something?
Yeah, how about me screaming at the top of my lungs?
I guess not.
I be tripping, boy, tripping.
- Daddy.
- There's my favorite little girl.
Daddy, don't you remember me?
It's me, Ashley.
She's so precious.
You know, she reminds me of someone.
That little girl who used to hang out around here.
- Pretty little thing.
Black hair.
- Amanda.
Ashley.
- Or was it Anna?
- No.
Ashley.
I'm pretty sure it was Appalonia.
No, it was Ashley.
- Well, hold up, was it Ashley?
- Yes.
- No.
- No.
Ashley, honey, your father and I have always been here and we will always make time for you.
Hilary, why not?
I mean, it will help your ratings.
I don't want to hear about it anymore, okay?
Now, here come your two eldest siblings, Dopey and Greedy.
No, Carlton, I will not plug your stupid school play on my weather spot today, tomorrow, or ever.
Well, for your information, Brigadoon is a classic musical comedy.
No, man, for my money, classic musical comedy: Milli Vanilli.
Think about it, Hilary's special because she's the oldest.
Carlton's the only boy.
I was the baby, but who am I now?
The whiner.
Look, lighten up, Ashley.
We all have our burdens to bear I mean, when the new Banks arrives, Dad's going to have to update his will which means there'll be another slice of the pie I won't be getting.
I mean, what about my needs?
What about me?
- What about - Shut up, Carlton.
Good call.
I can't wait till the new baby's born.
Then I can do all those special things that big sisters do.
Like when you took me up to the attic window and told me I could fly?
Or when you told me it was okay to roller skate down the steps.
Judging by your lovely brothers and sisters you're going to need an insurance policy before you're potty trained.
Look, I'll have you guys know that I had a hand in raising you.
I'll be a positive influence on the new baby.
You just wait and see.
Hilary, baby, you're 30 years old.
Don't you think it's about time you moved out on your own?
That is so unfair.
Mom's 50 years old and you haven't pushed her out the door.
Why do I even bother?
Cindy.
Aren't you forgetting something, baby sister?
- You're prettier than I'll ever be.
- Something else.
Good.
Now, I'm feeling a little warm.
So, tell me about your day at school and move a little to the left.
Well, Miss Randolph gave a pop quiz and l - Do you like my outfit?
- It's real pretty.
Hilary, my arm is starting to hurt.
You poor baby.
Use the other arm.
Maybe you should start lifting weights.
Anyway, go on with your story.
Well, Myra Walker brought a hamster to class for show and tell - Should I color my hair?
- No, it's beautiful.
It is, isn't it?
Guess what?
I have a little surprise for you.
Ta-da!
Oh, goody, a shoeshine kit.
I know I spoil you, but I just couldn't resist.
Do you like my shoes?
They're great.
Well, you know, they'd be even better if they were shiny.
Can I put the fan down first?
This time.
It is your birthday.
But don't make a habit of it.
A spit polish.
I meant on the shoes.
Maybe I'd just be better off being invisible.
I'm sorry, what'd you say, Ash?
Hold it there, home fry.
Say a little something to spud.
Hey, little bro, piece of advice: Don't lend Will a penny even if he begs, and he will.
That's your brother Carlton.
You'll recognize him, he'll be the one at eye-level.
Hello.
Hello, Dr. Graham.
Yes, this is Philip Banks.
Fine, fine, thank you, and how are you?
Unusual?
I see.
Are you sure?
Okay, I'll tell her right away.
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Vivian, you better sit down.
I am sitting down.
Philip, is there something wrong with the baby?
No, that was the doctor.
He just said that he thinks that we're having twins.
Twins!
- Oh, my God!
- Two birds!
Two birds!
- Come on, Daddy.
- Come on.
- Philip, honey.
- Come on.
I got it, y'all.
Look out.
What happened?
Come on, get him up, get him up.
I remember something about twins and I have this incredible urge for a sausage.
Philip, the doctor called, but there must be some mistake.
I couldn't possibly be having twins.
We'll have to split the inheritance four ways thanks to Forget-the-pill Phil.
Is that all you think about?
Pretty much.
I don't know about y'all, I'm excited we having twins.
I mean, now you can finally have the son you always wanted.
Well, they already have me.
Now, you can finally have the son you always wanted.
Hello.
Yes, Doctor.
You know, I figured there must be some mistake.
I knew I couldn't possibly be having twins.
Triplets?
That's right, Mrs. Banks.
You'll be having three little ones so I suggest a lot more help.
Preferably a young nanny amply endowed, with no inhibitions.
Hello.
Might I get you anything?
- An explanation.
- Mid-life crisis.
Geoffrey, why did you do it?
I'm terribly sorry, madam.
It was just the thought of one more person to clean up after was more than I could bear.
Geoffrey, this baby is all of our responsibility and I promise you we will not leave you with all the work.
Geoffrey, I told you, I wanted tomatoes in my omelet.
Geoffrey, I need some sliced cucumbers for my eyelids.
G, the phone's ringing.
Geoffrey, you did my homework all wrong.
Do it again.
Master William, would you go change the baby?
I'm trying to do 10 things at once!
Sorry, no can do, G. I'm about to go shoot some hoops.
Hey, do me a favor, spit shine my kicks for me, though.
Thanks, babe.
For heaven's sake, I'll get it.
Hello.
Hi, Daddy.
Geoffrey is so lazy.
So, how's Jamaica?
What'd you buy me?
Great.
Great.
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye.
Well, what did your father say?
For God's sake, when are they coming back?
They'll be home in time for graduation.
- Thank heavens.
- The baby's.
They figure you can handle things until then.
Look, G, check it out, I'm a peace-Ioving brother but if you don't hurry up with my kicks, I'm gonna split your wig, man.
- I want a new omelet.
- Homework.
- Cucumbers.
- Are you ignorant?
- I know you old.
- I want the omelet.
When you old, you do stuff like this.
What's up with my kicks?
Calgon, take me away!
Geoffrey, you're exaggerating.
And you're lying through your bonded teeth.
Well, that's Geoffrey.
He pretends he doesn't like the family but deep down inside he really hates us.
That's not true.
I can tolerate Miss Ashley.
Man, I can't wait to start my own family.
Yo, I want to have a whole bunch of kids, like six and I'm going to have them one right after another.
Will, we're talking about kids, not malt liquor.
Why don't you shut up before we send you back to that white family that dropped you off on the doorstep?
I don't know if I want to have kids.
Why not?
I told you, I don't know.
Hilary, honey, you're gonna change your mind.
Having kids makes life worthwhile.
Boy, I just can't wait.
I mean, I'm gonna have the perfect life with a perfect wife and perfect kids.
It's perfect.
Honey, I'm home.
Hi, dear, did you have a tough day shooting the naked centerfolds?
Yeah, babe, it was hell.
Today we shot La Toya Jackson.
And I had to keep turning the lights off 'cause she was melting.
You poor baby.
Why don't you glue yourself to the television set completely ignore me and play Nintendo until you're too tired to make love?
- You mean you don't mind?
- Have I ever?
I'm perfect.
- Hello, Father.
- Hey, Shaquille, Barkley, Jordan.
Okay, forget about that.
Check it out.
Why don't we go outside and shoot some hoops?
What are hoops?
I think he's referring to that sport where a spherical object is thrown into a round receptacle at opposite ends of a court.
You watch your mouth, boy.
All right, look, forget basketball.
Come here, come here, come here.
What do y'all say we sneak and get some candy before dinner?
But that would spoil our appetite, and tonight we're having liver.
Yeah!
Shantay!
Don't do that.
I'm sorry, dear.
Did you want something?
Yes, I'd like to know what pods these kids came from.
Actually, Father, we came from a zygote.
You see, in human reproduction Knock it off.
Ever since you won that Nobel Prize you think you're so doggone smart.
Honey, you seem tense.
I am tense.
Everybody all perfect, baby, I don't know.
Why don't I send the children away and dress up in that French maid's uniform and give you a nice hot-oil massage?
You, you, you!
Why must everything always be about you?
What about my needs?
I'm sorry, honey.
What do you want?
I want a girl with extensions in her hair and bamboo earrings, at least two pair.
I want kids that pick their noses sometimes and roll me when I'm drunk.
I mean, I want a dirty house.
No, I want a dirty house.
I want to argue in public, you know.
I want you to have a headache sometime.
I want a regular life.
I want a regular marriage.
Sweetheart, you seem upset.
Let's all give Daddy a great big hug.
- No!
No!
- Yeah!
No!
See, Will, I told you this baby thing was a lousy idea.
Kids aren't all they're cracked up to be.
And I know, I used to be one.
Now, stop it all of you.
Now, I cannot wait for this baby to get here.
And that's not just because I'm retaining more water than the Hoover Dam.
Ashley, honey we're not going to forget you when the baby comes.
You'll see, this will bring us all closer together.
That's true, Ash.
I mean, look at us now.
Last time we sat around like this is when they reran Roots.
Maybe you guys are right.
We shouldn't be so selfish and think about ourselves all the time Geoffrey.
Well, I guess I don't mind sharing my inheritance with the baby.
- We're not dead yet, Carlton.
- Hey, it's a cruel world, big guy and you're not going to be in it forever.
Come on.
Now, now, come on, let's not spoil the mood.
Come on, let's go to dinner, huh?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Okay.
All right.
You, too, Geoffrey.
Zip-a-dee, and might I add doo-dah!
Maybe this will be a good idea.
- I'm going to go grab my sweater.
- Okay.
I don't feel good.
Forget it, Hilary.
You're coming.
Okay, but I'm not sitting between you and the dessert cart.
Last time I almost lost an eye.
Okay, so where are we going?
I say Snuffy's Catfish and Biscuits.
Why don't we just go eat out of a dumpster?
- Come on, let's decide in the car.
- All right.
How about Haitian?
- Let's get some Haitian food.
- French.
I'm ready.
And, you know, I'm feeling really silly about that invisible stuff.
Where'd everybody go?
Hey, no!
Hey, wait for me!
Oh, no!
And all those big nasty women you be bringing up in here, too.
You think Uncle Phil don't know.
He knows.
He knows what you do, Geoffrey, okay?
Now, I'm asking you to just do my sneaks.
I want to go.
I want to run some balls going to be some girls there, I gotta look cute.
If I have dirty sneaks, other guys going to get the girls.
All I'm asking is to have some clean sneaks when I go dunk on some people, all right?
So, Geoffrey, straighten your act up.
Okay, look, get some Ca/gon, take me away!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh, man.
You know, Monique I've never said this to a girl before, but Oh, baby, you all that and a bag of chips!
Oh, Will, am I?
Hey, I'm lying, I'm dying, you know what I'm saying?
Oh, Will.
Hey, babe, I got to tell you, whatever it is that you serving y ou better give me a double!
I was just playing.
You know how I be joking.
I be joking.
I wasn't being straight up with you.
But I will now.
Monique, I care about you, baby.
I care about you so much.
I couldn't trust myself to express my real feelings.
- Hey.
- Hey, Will.
Man, something smells good.
Oh, wait, that's me.
Hey, y'all, check it out.
I just tried on that new Michael Jackson cologne down at the mall.
I don't smell anything.
Oh, that's funny.
It's a lot lighter than it was when I put it on.
What are you doing wearing cologne anyway?
You never wear cologne.
He wants to smell good for Monique.
They have a big date tonight.
Yeah.
Well, I figured, you know, y'all gonna be out the house and my man, G, here has the night off.
I figure Monique will come over, we'll go up to my room and six or seven hours later, we'll come back down again, you know what I'm saying?
You don't know what I'm saying.
Well, guys what do you think of my new dress?
Doesn't make me look too big, does it?
No?
Hilary, what do you think, honey?
Well, you know how I'm always borrowing your things?
Well, you don't have to worry about this one.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, dear!
- Hi.
- Oh, what a day.
If you guys don't mind it, I'm going to skip dinner and clear up some paperwork.
Philip, remember we're going to go out to dinner?
Yeah, remember?
Yeah, of course, I remember.
I've been looking forward to it all day.
So, where are we going?
To the restaurant.
Le Chez Mc All right, Vivian, I forgot.
I don't believe it.
Fine.
We might as well just stay home.
Vivian.
Philip, forget it.
I don't want to go out if you don't want to.
What about what I want?
I mean, what about my needs?
Here you are, madam.
I'm guessing they're not for me.
I haven't put out in years.
Oh, Philip, they're beautiful.
Let me.
"I'm looking forward to dinner tonight "with the most beautiful woman in the world".
I love you.
Oh, Philip, you were teasing me.
- I love you, too.
- Yes.
- Okay, let me just go freshen up.
- Okay, baby.
Love you.
Uncle Phil, Trevor sent these flowers.
They're for Hilary.
Not anymore.
Uncle Phil, you lied to your woman.
My man, give it up top.
"Mirror, mirror on the wall" Jean-Claude Van Damn, I'm fine.
Miss Monique is here to see you.
- What's up, baby?
- Hi, honey.
Oh, if you need me, I'll be dodging winos at the bus station.
You know, my father would kill me if he knew I was out with a boy tonight.
I told him I was going to church.
The Lord is good.
Why don't you come on over here, sit down, relax a little bit.
Okay.
Boy, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.
And I ain't even oiled up yet, you know?
I think I should tell you, nothing turns me on more than a sense of humor.
Really?
Maybe you'd like to go upstairs and I could do my stand-up.
Now, why waste time going upstairs?
See, this way whenever you pass the couch, you'll think of me.
Maybe I could get some memories of you in the kitchen and the Jacuzzi, too.
Watch yourself, girl.
Mama knows, child.
Baby, what you doing?
Will, I can't do this.
I better go.
Baby, what's the problem?
You really turn me on.
What's the problem?
I don't know, Will.
I really thought that I could handle all this but I can't, so we better stop.
Baby, some things just ain't that easy to stop.
I know, and it isn't that easy for me either but, Will, I want you.
But I guess deep down inside I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
I want to be married before I go all the way.
You understand, don't you?
Look, Monique, I'd love to talk, but there ain't no blood in my brain.
Will.
It's only 7:00.
What are you doing up?
Look here, I've been up for hours, man.
I swam like 20 laps in the pool went down shot some hoops, jogged around the track a half dozen times.
I waxed your car for you, too.
No nookie last night?
Man, no nookie, no nothing, man.
Look, see, I don't understand, man.
She was here, everything was lovely and perfect then all of a sudden, she wasn't with it no more.
I don't get it.
Will, you just don't understand women.
When it comes to matters of the heart, you can't rush things.
Give a girl time, she'll come around.
Really?
How long do you usually give them?
Let's see, a week from Friday, it will be 18 years.
- Morning, boys.
- Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, son.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, check it out.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Do you have to?
Come on, Uncle Phil, this is serious, man.
I need to talk to you about - cars.
- Cars, you Oh, cars!
Yeah, well, I guess it is about time that you and I started talking about - cars.
- Cars.
Oh, God, this car isn't in trouble, is it?
Oh, no.
Never been off the lot as far as I can tell.
Look, Will, driving is serious business.
Well, these days you got to think about safety.
You never want to go for a ride in a car without your seat belt.
And use your brakes.
Don't floor it because then you throw a rod, you flood your carburetor, you crack your block.
You understand what I'm saying?
No, man.
No sex before marriage.
- Come on, Uncle Phil, this is the '90s, man.
- Take a cold shower.
I've been doing that since the '80s.
It don't work no more.
Look, Will, I know I'm talking to teenage hormones from hell but if you care about this young lady, you don't want to do anything to damage the relationship.
And intimacy requires a real commitment.
Uncle Phil, I'm saying, Uncle Phil.
We both mens here, you know?
We got ugly needs.
Will, you're a grown man.
I can't watch you all the time.
I'm just going to have to rely on you to do the right thing.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to unite this couple in holy matrimony.
And by the powers invested into me and for the republic in which it stands I now pronounce you man and wife.
Get busy.
Will, I'm so happy.
I can't believe we did this.
Me, neither.
Come on, let's go, baby.
Father, Father.
Chill, all right?
Look, baby, I'm I need to take care of the Reverend, all right?
Okay, honey, I'm going to go warm up the car.
Hey.
This is God's crib.
Take that in the street where it belongs.
We better get out of here, my brother.
Any minute now that minister's going to realize his house ain't on fire.
I don't believe this, Jazz, man, together we are invincible.
Granted, my brother, we're good, but people can still see us.
Baby, here we go.
Over the threshold.
Oh, look at this, a chair a nice drawer.
Oh, but look what's over here, a bed.
Honey, wait.
Slow it down.
This is our wedding night.
I know, I know, but we only got 18 hours left before checkout.
These damn buttons.
You got some scissors, girl?
Will, please, now, come on.
Just give me a minute, okay?
I want to put something special on for you.
And I promise it'll be worth the wait.
Trust me.
Hey.
I'm ready.
Do you like it?
Wow!
I love it.
- All right, now, take it off.
- Oh, honey.
Will, we're married.
I am so happy and I'm going to make you happy, too.
Okey doke.
Girl, be gentle.
Honey, I meant for the rest of our lives.
I'm going to be a good wife, Will because I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
Don't you?
Yeah, come on, baby, let's get naked.
This thing open from the back or the front?
Oh, Will.
There's something I want to give to you.
What a coincidence 'cause there's something I want to give you, too.
This.
It belonged to my great grandfather.
Now I want you to have it.
- Thanks, a little box.
- You didn't even open it, silly.
Here.
My great grandmother gave it to him on their wedding night.
And Grandma gave it to Grampy and Mama gave it to Daddy and now I'm giving it to you.
My parents are going to kill me when they find out what we've done, but But I don't care.
Will, I'm proud that you're part of my family now because you're decent and honest.
Baby, I trust you.
And I know you will love me and cherish me as long as we both shall live.
Now, take me.
Oh, damn!
All right, all right, look, check it out.
Look here.
I'll be right back, baby.
- Where are you going?
- I mean, look you gave me Grampy's watch and everything, and I ain't got nothing for you.
So I got to go get you something.
Sorry, Grampy.
You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up the priesthood for you.
You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up Excuse me, Father, could I rap to you for a second.
Don't go away baby.
Bartender, another Olde English for the lady.
It's a fashion risk, but I like it.
Jazz, sit down.
Look, I can't believe I let you talk me into this, man.
I feel awful.
Will, a naked, willing female is in your room.
Stop me when I get to the awful part.
I don't have a right to treat her like this, man.
She's a human being.
Well, that's enough.
Now, get a bottle of whiskey, liquor that girl up and take advantage of her.
Be a man for God's sake.
Jazz, I'm sorry, man, I can't.
I've got to tell her the truth.
Maybe you're right.
Perhaps we've both been a little remiss in our treatment of women.
You think?
Yeah.
You inspire me, Prince.
From now on I, too, will be completely honest in my dealings with the fair sex.
My man.
You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up the priesthood for you.
Honey, where have you Monique, this is going to be hard enough as it is so please just let me do the talking.
I know you respect honesty in a man, so I'm going to be honest.
Monique, I just wanted to get you into bed so I tricked you.
The whole ceremony was a fake and we're not really married.
Monique, look, I'm sorry and I know what I did was wrong.
And, Monique, I really care about you.
I'm sorry.
Monique the room is paid for and everything, so why don't, you know I was just hoping that maybe since So, could you just come get me, Uncle Phil?
Your Mercedes?
Oh, well, yeah.
No.
See, actually, yeah.
I did borrow it.
Well, but, you know, it's not here right now.
Well, to be honest, my wife took it.
All I could overhear were the words Mercedes, wife, and Monique and then Dad ran out of the house.
Well, I think it's obvious what happened.
Will and Monique stole a Mercedes, and ran over somebody's wife.
Carlton, that's ridiculous.
Obviously, Will has been seeing a woman named Mercedes, Monique found out and I'm still working on the wife part.
Well, I think Will married Monique just to get her into bed and when she found out, she got so mad she took off in Dad's Mercedes.
Get real!
I still can't believe that you could do something so despicable.
I mean, marrying Monique just to get her in bed?
Even I don't believe it.
I can't imagine what kind of excuse you could come up with.
Do you have anything to say in your own defense?
Nothing.
It's shameful, Uncle Phil.
I mean, here you are busting your hump trying to impart values and teach basic human decency and I turn around and do some mess like this.
I just don't get it, Will.
I mean what is going on in that head of yours?
I don't know, Uncle Phil.
I'm out of control.
Please stop me before I disobey again.
Don't you ever stop to think before you do these disgusting things?
Of course, I do, Uncle Phil.
Do you think I like being the way I am?
I'm a victim.
I'm a victim of my imagination.
Help me.
Well all right, since you put it that way.
I'm not going to punish you, Will.
You know, that's radical, Uncle Phil, but it just might work.
I'm not going to punish you today maybe not even tomorrow.
You see, I need to think a long, long time about just what I'm going to do with you.
I don't know, it might come to me in the middle of the night or maybe next week, or a few years from now.
In the meantime, why don't you worry about it?
Be afraid, Will.
Be very afraid.
I've got it.
Will!
I want to put something special on for you.
And I promise it'll be worth the wait.
Trust me.
/ got that effect on women, you know.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hilary, when is G getting back?
I'm starving.
Don't worry, Will, I made breakfast.
Damn, I'm full.
Couldn't eat another bite.
Come on, Will.
I know what I'm doing.
Remember, I was a professional caterer.
And you still would be if you hadn't poisoned those nuns.
The autopsy was inconclusive.
Bon appétit.
Come on, let's give her a chance.
These eggs aren't bad.
What's the crunchy stuff?
Great, you found my contact.
Then who's the guy in the toga?
That's Bill Reingold.
He's the president of Amatrax Oil.
And the guy with his head in the toilet?
That's Ben Winter.
He's a great heart surgeon.
And the guy getting slapped by the girl?
That's Clarence Thomas.
What's going on, guys?
You're looking at your old Princeton fraternity pictures?
Will, please.
Princeton doesn't have fraternities.
They have dining clubs.
Where the leaders of tomorrow break bread and plan the future.
That's right, son.
My dining club's what made me the man I am today.
No, that's too easy.
And since you're my son you're guaranteed my seat in the club I joined.
If you don't know which seat is his it'll be the one with the legs all bent out up from under it.
Come on, I gave you a free one earlier.
Carlton what I'm about to do is strictly forbidden.
But since you're going to Princeton I'm going to teach you my club's secret handshake.
Turn around, Will.
You gotta be facing somebody's butt to do this handshake?
It's a secret.
I don't see what the big deal is about Princeton anyway.
Simple, they're interviewing at Bel-Air Prep this week.
They're looking for a few good men.
Darn, Carlton.
If they was looking for a few good Pygmies, you'd have been a shoe in.
Face it, ghetto goof there's no one at Bel-Air Prep that comes close to having my grades or my willingness to flatter authority figures without a thought to personal dignity.
They'll be lucky to have you, son.
And you're the guy who taught me.
By the way, you look really great in denim.
See?
So, Will, have you scheduled your interview?
Man, I tell you, you ain't got to worry about me applying to no old Bugie or Muffy and Biffo chicken-head old kind of I just didn't have a chance to get around to it yet, Uncle Phil.
Do it tomorrow.
Wait.
Come on, Uncle Phil, I've already decided where I wanna go.
Will, the standards of the Jim-Bob School of Trucking are pretty darn high.
Look, man, what are you doing here anyway?
Your appointment isn't till tomorrow.
Simple, I'm here to pick up the shattered pieces of your self-esteem to nourish you in your hour of defeat.
And do you know why, Will?
Because when I come out of here a broken man you wanna be the first person to rub my nose in it?
No, I'm really here for you, Will.
Then why did you bring a video camera?
- Mr. Will Smith.
- Yo.
"Yo"?
So, Mr. Smith you want to go to Princeton.
Well, actually, I wanna go to Sea World, but is Princeton along the way?
You're funny.
We frown on that at Princeton.
Okay.
Look, actually, I gotta be honest with you.
I just came because my uncle made me.
I really don't wanna go to Princeton.
Everybody wants to go to Princeton.
Well, not me, amigo.
Then you're in luck, Mr. Smith.
Your scores are mediocre your grades would make an impressive batting average and your extracurricular activities are non-existent.
Unless one counts detention, in which case you lead the league.
But my jacket is a fashion miracle, though, isn't it?
In short, you're not Princeton material.
And your hat is on backwards.
We frown on that at Princeton.
Y'all frown on a lot of stuff at Princeton.
Bunch of sad-Iooking people walking around Look, actually, sir I just really don't know what Princeton would have to offer me.
I mean, are there any cute honeys?
Mr. Smith Princeton has some of the most intelligent young women in the country.
There's no way I would make a crass generalization about such a diverse group.
Any cute honeys?
No.
Well, then I guess my work here is done.
But as a parting gift here you go.
How did you do that?
I've been working on this thing for months.
Yeah, well, take care, buddy.
Wait a minute.
- Oh, man.
- You get your English scores up and I'll recommend that you get accepted into Princeton.
- Look, I don't know, Ed, it's just - Please, for me.
It would mean a lot.
All right, I'll think about it.
Peace out, E- Money.
Piece of cake.
What's the capital of Burma?
- Look, man, I don't know.
- Rangoon.
Six hundred and forty acres is?
I don't know, the size of Barry White's hot tub.
A square mile.
Who said, "It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees"?
I'm guessing that one wasn't Madonna.
Emiliano Zapata.
They made a mistake.
You don't deserve to go to Princeton.
Wait a minute, Will Princeton is considering you?
Considering me?
Begging me is more like it.
I mean, them people just will not take "no" for an answer.
- You turned them down?
- A bunch of times.
But you know, dude started getting all weepy-eyed and everything so I told him I'd sleep on it.
How'd you do it, Will?
The truth.
Carlton, I was just myself.
I guess that was good enough.
This is Princeton, Will.
They don't want people who are themselves.
They want people like me.
Now, fess up.
I told you, Carlton, I was just myself.
We talked.
I told him about the hood back in Philly.
And he told me about some stuff called Spam.
You know, if you're getting a shot at Princeton, that's pretty impressive.
I'm proud of you, son.
Proud enough to let me use the Volvo next weekend?
Sure.
Did my lips say Volvo?
My lips meant to say Jag.
Why not?
You know what, Uncle Phil, I think I might like this Princeton thing after all.
You think you can show me that handshake?
Well, okay, but we can't show it to strangers, you know.
Mr. Carlton Banks?
Yo, what's up?
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
I've been looking through your transcript, Mr. Banks.
You don't have to call me Mr. Banks.
My posse calls me Rap Master C. Excuse me?
Rap Master is my name.
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.
Didn't mean to dis you, can I get you a tissue?
So, Rap Master I noticed that you are the treasurer of your y oung Republican Club.
Three years running.
But enough about that Bugie stuff.
Let me teach you how to vogue.
Strike a pose.
Mr. Banks, are you on some sort of medication?
Let me teach you how to wear a hat.
Mr. Banks, please.
Mr. Banks, you're nothing like what I expected.
I'm not?
Your scores are topnotch and your grades couldn't be better.
They are.
Unfortunately, at this time Princeton doesn't accept the clinically insane.
Next!
That's it?
That's it.
Close the door when you leave.
There must be some mistake.
Princeton's the only place I've ever wanted to go.
It's the centerpiece of my life's master plan.
- I hardly think you - y ou think I'm exaggerating?
Look, this is my master plan.
See where Princeton comes in?
Right after "lose virginity".
You're even stranger than I thought.
Thank you for your interest in Princeton, Rap Master it's time for my 3:30.
Look, please don't do this to me.
Do you want me to beg?
I'm begging you.
Anything you want.
You know, my sister Hilary's not bad-Iooking and after two drinks or so she'll do just about anything, so - Are you through?
- My dad's got money.
A lot of money.
And if you played your cards right he just might - Goodbye.
- Look, Ed you seem like an intelligent man.
A man who knows what's good for himself.
Accepting me would be very good for you, Ed because I have friends.
Big friends.
Big friends with lots of body hair and mozzarella on their breath.
Capisce?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but was that a death threat?
- So how'd it go, son?
- Did they accept you?
Did you even have to ask?
They're not just accepting me, they're giving me a full scholarship.
Yes!
Oh, God.
Congratulations.
We are so proud of you!
Good going, C. Can I have your dresser?
I can't believe this.
A full scholarship?
That's amazing.
I guess all that hard work paid off.
Philip, we're gonna have to have a party, invite all of Carlton' s friends.
- I can't come.
- Why not?
Because Carlton doesn't have any friends and I'll have to dance with him.
Mom, I appreciate the thought, but let's not go overboard.
No.
Now, this seems to call for a new car.
How about one of those little convertibles, huh?
Princeton orange.
- Sure, Dad, but - No buts, Carlton.
You have made me so proud.
I made my bed.
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
Hello?
It's Mr. Robinson, your principal.
Well, you're a little late, sir, I just heard the good news.
That's impossible.
How could he get suspended after he just got a full scholarship?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, goodbye.
Philip, what's going on?
Carlton tell me you didn't threaten to kill the man from Princeton.
Oh, my God.
- Dad, l - Just tell me that, please.
I can't.
Yo, C, you look bad, man.
Stop trying to butter me up, Will.
Come on, baby, give Mama a kiss.
Look, go away.
Come on, Mama knows, child, come on.
Stop, Will, it's not funny.
You ruined my life, you you big poopy.
You get everything you want without trying.
You get picked first for teams, the cutest girls, everything.
Why?
'Cause I don't say stuff like "big poopy"?
Why don't you just go back to Philly?
Do I detect a little hostility?
You owe me some flowers, mister.
Now /ook, you mustn't ta/k /ike that.
/ won't get my wings with that attitude.
/ don't know, / guess you're right.
/ suppose it wou/d have been better if /'d never been born at a//.
What did you say?
/ said, "/ wish /'d never been born".
You and me both, pal.
What the Oh, my God, it's Tom Jones.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm your guardian angel.
No offense, Tom, but I always thought my guardian angel would be black.
Well, I knew Otis Redding.
Well, anyway, I'm glad you came.
I've been so unhappy.
I know.
Break it down to me.
Tell me what's wrong.
Well, it's kind of hard to put into words.
I know.
Tom, you're the best guardian angel a guy could ever ask for.
Do you think you could change history so that I've never been born?
Well, not quite.
But I could probably pull some strings and have you moved opposite Roseanne.
But before I do that I want you to see what things would be like if you didn't exist.
- I'm coming now.
Come on, shoot.
- Okay.
He dribbles down, he turns into Darryl Dawkins, he's breaks the backboard.
What happened, and where's Mom?
Well, without you, your family was defenseless against Will.
You see, they started to focus on happiness instead of success.
Your mother ran away with the milkman your father quit his practice to paint Ashley does nothing but dance all day and Hilary just does her hair.
Well, maybe not everything changed.
But they're not making any money.
I mean, so what if they're happy?
How are they going to afford this house our cars, our club memberships?
Well, they can't.
They're gonna lose it all.
Happiness has ruined them.
I've gotta save them.
I've got to teach them about greed and social climbing and how to claim your dog as a dependent.
Now that's the Carlton I know.
Maestro.
Good morning, Will.
"Good morning"?
You sure you don't mean, "Die, you gravy-sucking pig"?
Will, I spoke out of turn earlier.
I had no right to attack you the way I did.
That's cool, man.
Plus, I decided I don't even want to go to Princeton, you know?
So I called up Ed and I put the good word in for you.
And he's giving me another chance?
Well, no, he still thinks you kind of crazy.
But he'd like to take Hilary out for cocktails.
Will, would you excuse us, please?
I'd like to talk to Carlton alone.
Go easy on him, Uncle Phil.
He's a moron.
Dad, before you start, I just wanna say I'm sorry about the death threat.
Son, I admit that wasn't exactly the bright spot of my day but what really hurt the most is that you lied to me.
But I didn't know how to tell you.
I mean, you were so happy that Princeton wanted Will.
I'd thought you'd like him more than me.
I could never like Will.
Well, I mean, I like him Wait a minute, here I am lying to you.
I really blew it.
I'm sorry you won't get to go to Princeton.
I know how much that meant to you.
Dad, the only reason I wanted to go to Princeton is because I wanted to be like you.
You can't be like me, Carlton.
Or like Will, or like anybody else.
You can only be like you.
There's no need to be cruel.
Son who you are is just fine with me.
I mean that.
Carlton.
Yeah?
You're grounded.
Thanks, Dad.
Do I sense a little hostility?
You owe me some flowers, mister.
/ did that on purpose.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Master Carlton, I have to take this tray up to your mother so on your way out would you mind taking out the garbage?
Do I look like Roc?
I don't know, Carlton, maybe if you shaved your head bald and sanded down the square part.
Ashley, you take out the garbage.
- Why me?
- Because I'm bigger than you.
See, that's not fair.
That's only 'cause you got them shoe lifts in today.
They're not lifts.
I doubled up on my Odor-Eaters.
- Here, Hilary, you take it out.
- Out where?
To the trash cans.
You know, those things you hit every time you back out the car.
Thank God.
I thought it was the neighbor's kids.
This is gross.
I don't touch greasy, disgusting things.
Well, just pretend it's buying you dinner afterwards.
- You take it.
- Yo, girl!
And for your information, dinner comes first.
Oh, it's like that, right?
You're just gonna slam garbage at me.
Good morning, Will.
Good morning, Uncle Phil.
Here's your lunch.
Thank you.
Good morning, Geoffrey.
Isn't it a glorious day?
Actually, sir, I have an impacted wisdom tooth my hair is falling out, and I have a bunion the size of my fist.
Oh, no.
We're out of Mrs. Butterworth's.
Thanks for the talk, big guy.
- Good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Good morning, Will.
- What up, G?
This mine?
- Morning, Master William.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Oh, man.
Hey, Will, why don't you sit down and eat?
Sorry but, Uncle Phil, I ain't got no time.
Oh, man.
Hey, look, any chance of you letting me balance this book on your head?
Hey, you know I was gonna put the waffles up there but that's just a little too close to your mouth, you know what I mean?
Will, sit down.
You're giving me motion sickness.
Sorry about that, Uncle Phil.
Man, it's like there's so much to do.
I mean, between my school work and Cindy and, you know, my job and Cindy and, you know, basketball and Cindy Wow, you think I'm neglecting Cindy?
Maybe you should take a little time off from work.
You're gonna wear yourself out.
Thank you, sir.
It's nice to know that all my labors haven't gone unnoticed.
I was talking to Will.
And I, apparently, was talking to myself.
Will, how about it?
You sure there's nobody who can cover for you at the restaurant?
No, I wish there was, Uncle Phil.
I've got to make some extra money for the prom.
I mean, 'cause I wouldn't feel like a gentleman if I made Cindy pay for my half, too.
- Look at my face!
- Please, man, we eating.
Will.
This is serious.
The prom's only three days away, and I got a pimple.
Carlton, we're eating.
I need some vitamin E. I should have seen it coming.
It never fails.
Every time I have a big date I get a big pimple.
Well, judging by the size of that thing, you must be going out with Nell Carter.
Hi, Will.
Cindy.
Cindy.
Cindy.
Girl, anybody ever told you that you got the Thanks, I'll try not to let it go to my head.
Look, sorry, baby.
All this running around is kind of catching up to me.
Well, you make sure you save some energy for the prom.
Don't you even worry about me, girl.
I'm gonna be all right.
I'm planning on staying up all night, you know 'cause "all I want to do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom".
What up, J?
Hey, Will.
You wanna carpool to work again after practice?
Yeah, that's cool, man.
You know, we're counting on you for the big game this weekend.
Hey, man, don't you even worry about me.
I'm gonna be there.
"Smith dribbles.
He stops.
He pops.
He scores.
The crowd goes wild"!
- Man, I'm beat.
- You could do what I do.
No, that's all right.
I don't think listening to Bruce Springsteen got the same effect on black people.
My breath ain't stinking, so I'm guessing them ain't Tic Tacs.
These will help you stay awake.
You've done speed before, right?
No, I didn't, and I didn't think you was living like that, either.
I'm into whatever gets the job done.
To me, it's just freeze-dried coffee, just in case.
Just in case.
Hey, guys.
Later, Will.
Big date this weekend?
I just want to thank Bill and Hillary Clinton for inviting me to the inauguration.
- Will, wake up.
- Yo, man, go away.
Will, this is the senior prom also known as "guaranteed action night".
Rack 'em up.
Here you are, Master William, maybe this'll help.
It's an old remedy passed down in my family from generation to generation.
- G, it's coffee.
- No, it's Folgers Crystals.
Will, pardon my tough love but this burning the candle at both ends is dumb, dumb, dumb.
I know, Carlton.
I just wish there was something else I could do.
It's like there ain't enough hours in the day.
Carlton, did you ever think about taking you know, drugs?
Will, you don't have to beat around the bush.
- I know exactly what you're getting at.
- You do?
You see the volcano-sized pimple about to erupt on my forehead and you don't think vitamin E is strong enough.
No, man.
I mean, well, yeah, but I mean, the kind of drugs that help you stay up.
Up?
You don't mean This sex thing is even more complicated than I thought.
You know what?
Never mind, man.
You know, Will, if it turns out tonight is the big night I'm just glad I'll be sharing it with someone who cares about me so deeply.
Yo, man, I'm just sharing a limo with you.
I'm talking about my date.
She worships the ground I walk on.
No, man, she's just looking for loose change.
Miss Cindy and Miss Vanessa.
Wow.
- You look great.
- Thank you, Carlton, so do you.
Somebody call a cop, 'cause it got to be illegal to look that good.
Oh, Will.
You look pretty terrific yourself.
Girl, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.
You kids look great.
Come on, let me get a picture.
- Mom!
- I know I'm treating you like a baby.
No, shoot me from the other side.
I've got a situation on my forehead.
Okay, smile.
Now, I know this is prom night, but I still think we should set a curfew.
Come on, Uncle Phil, don't you even worry about it.
Come on, we'll be home early.
Early tomorrow morning.
Hey, stop.
Come on, one more picture.
Hey, yo, I'm telling you, this is gonna be the most exciting night of our lives.
Will.
Will.
Will, wake up.
Vanessa keeps staring at my pimples.
What should I do?
Stare at hers.
Come on, Will, you gotta help me.
This could be the biggest night of my life.
Yeah, to go along with the biggest zit of your life.
The least you can do is give me some vitamin E. Carlton, vitamin E is not going to help, man.
A sandblaster is not going to help, man.
Come on, Will, don't hold out on me.
You have any or not?
Look, I don't know.
Look, check my locker, man.
Look, and if there ain't nothing in there you can just pull your big ol' bottom lip up over your head.
Will.
Will.
Hey, girl, what's up?
You've been sleeping all night.
When are you gonna ask me to dance?
No, baby, we gonna get down.
I'm just waiting for the DJ to throw on something I like.
How about "I'm going home"?
Now that's the jam.
Tell me when he puts that on.
Go, Carlton.
Go, Carlton.
Go, Carlton.
Oh, Carlton, you were something else.
Carlton, you were somebody else.
Man, you all right?
I feel great.
Even though I was feeling insecure before, I realized it doesn't matter, anyway 'cause beauty's only skin deep.
It's what's inside that counts.
Vanessa, you drive me wild.
I hope this night never ends.
Is it just me or are my lips moving really, really fast?
Wanna dance?
Come on.
Your cousin's pretty wild.
I guess he's got that kind of natural speed thing going.
Yeah, you can say that again.
Want me to hook you up with some more of those pills?
I'll get you a good price.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Carlton.
Carlton.
Carlton, listen.
Something terrible has happened, man.
- Come on, I gotta get you to the hospital.
- Why?
- This is the greatest night of my - Carlton.
Carlton.
Yo, Carlton, man.
God, if you let Carlton be okay I swear I'll never make fun of him again.
I'll go to Church every Sunday.
I'll even give up women.
Will, was that you?
You know I was just kidding about that woman part, right?
Where am I?
Last thing I remember, I was doing the running man to / Wi// A/ways Love You.
Carlton, you're at a hospital.
I feel terrible.
I never thought losing my virginity would be this painful.
Carlton, I got some bad news.
- Oh, God, I malfunctioned.
- No.
See, you never made it past the dance floor.
Those pills that you took weren't vitamins.
What were they?
Look, you gotta promise you're not gonna overreact.
What could be worse than finding out I'm still a virgin?
It was speed.
Oh, my God.
I'm a drug addict and a virgin!
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Now be quiet.
Comfy?
Well, Mr. Banks, you gave us quite a scare.
- How you feeling now?
- Terrible.
I wanna go home.
Your parents are on the way but we will have to keep you here in the Chemical Dependency Unit overnight.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, but that's standard procedure with all our substance-abuse patients.
Excuse me, Miss Irene, that's such a pretty name.
Listen I don't think you understand.
See, Carlton is not addicted to drugs.
I mean, Carlton hates drugs.
We still have to mix his aspirin in with applesauce.
Well, that may be but that certainly wasn't applesauce we pumped out of his stomach.
Can't we at least move me to another part of the hospital?
I've got a reputation to worry about.
What if I want to run for a political office?
Well, now, I'll tell you the same thing I told the last person that asked me that question: Just say you didn't inhale.
Listen, somehow we're missing each other.
I mean, does he look like a drug addict?
- Do I?
- Can we stick to the subject, please?
Listen, sweetie, the first time I came into this hospital it was on a stretcher.
Hell, I've been from y ale to jail, and from Park Avenue to park bench but now I'm clean and sober.
That's really touching but do you think you can get me a nurse without a record?
I like him.
Try and help him to stick around.
- Honey, are you okay?
- I think so.
Oh, thank God.
Now, what the hell are you doing with 2,000 milligrams of amphetamines in your stomach?
It was an accident.
I thought they were vitamin E tablets.
I got them from one of the other kids' lockers at school.
Carlton, you cannot take unidentified pills.
It's just plain stupid.
- Lf Will hadn't gotten you to the hospital - Hey, look, Uncle Phil I'm gonna go let Ashley and Hilary and Geoffrey know that he's all right.
No, Will, I just want to thank you.
You showed quick thinking and sound judgment.
- Carlton, you could learn from Will.
- Uncle Phil, please.
No, now it's not often that I get a chance to compliment you.
As a matter of fact, I think this is the one and only time.
Anyway, look, I just want you to know how grateful your aunt and I are.
You know, if it weren't for you, Will I don't know where Carlton would be right now.
Carlton, honey, don't you have something to say to Will?
Like what?
Like, "I'm sorry for ruining your prom," and, "thank you for saving my life"?
No, that's all right.
No, really.
Bye.
I'm sorry, folks, but this patient of ours has to get his rest.
We're not gonna leave our baby alone.
We're gonna be spending the night.
We are?
I mean, we are, yes.
Could you get us some clean linen for that bed?
Honey, I don't think we can both fit in that bed.
Right, and a chair for my wife.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me, too.
- Welcome home, Master Carlton.
- Thanks, I feel a lot better.
Yeah, thanks to Will.
He really saved the day.
Well, I'm gonna go take a nap.
I didn't get much sleep last night with all that kicking.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Hey, look.
Y'all mind if I talk to Carlton for a second?
Carlton, I'm sorry you had such a rough night.
Hey, but at least your face cleared up.
Almost.
Thanks a lot for covering for me, man.
But why did you do it?
I don't know.
I think I was still high.
Will, how long have you been taking drugs?
Come on, man, I ain't taking no drugs.
All right, look, I thought about it, but Look, you wouldn't understand, man.
Will, you're not the only one who's ever thought about taking drugs.
- You're kidding.
- Hey, I've got a wild side.
I don't always wear shower shoes at the gym.
I can't even believe you thought about it.
Yeah, but after last night, I'll never think about it again.
Yeah, and when Uncle Phil finds out you'll never see me again.
Look, Will he's not gonna find out.
Let's just put this all behind us.
Hey, Carlton, look, I'm sorry, man.
I mean, you're my homey, and I almost took you out.
I love you, man.
I never meant to hurt you.
I know.
I'm sorry, man.
- Will?
- Yo?
You haven't showered yet today, have you?
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Hey, Will, how's my favorite nephew?
- You talking to me?
- You know, I have something for you.
I was gonna save it for graduation but after what you did, I think I'll give it to you now.
- Yo, season tickets to the Clippers.
- That's right, courtside.
I can't take this, Uncle Phil.
- There's something I need to tell you.
- What is it?
Those pills that Carlton took they were from my locker.
What?
Look, Uncle Phil, I was just keeping them in case I needed them.
How could you be so stupid?
You know you shouldn't be messing with drugs.
I know, Uncle Phil.
Somebody gave them to me at school.
I mean, I didn't mean for Carlton to take them.
I didn't even know if I was going to take them.
- I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
- Sorry?
My son could have died because of you.
Look, I know, Uncle Phil, that's all I've been thinking about.
I mean, you gotta believe me.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
Yeah, well, you did.
You hurt him, and you could have hurt yourself.
I know, Uncle Phil, I mean But, look, I had basketball practice, and school, and I had work and everything.
Welcome to the real world, Will.
That's not an excuse.
There's never an excuse.
You owe this family an apology.
Vivian!
Kids!
- What's going on?
- Will has something to tell you.
- Come on, Uncle Phil, don't make me - Go ahead, Will.
The pills that Carlton took, they were from my locker.
- What?
- I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
I mean, I had basketball practice, and I had finals, and everything and one of the guys at school just offered me some stuff to help me stay awake.
And then Carlton Look, all I know is that somebody real close to me that I love a whole lot could be dead right now and it would be all my fault.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Come here.
- I'm sorry I did it.
- It's okay.
Come on.
Somebody call a cop 'cause it has got to be Somebody call a cop 'cause this has y ou'll get it.
We/come to the Wi// Fresh Prince Ever Say His Line contest.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Get up.
Hurry, everybody, get up!
Yo, what's the matter, Uncle Phil?
Calm down, Will, calm down.
It's Vivian, she's having the baby.
That ain't what's scaring me.
You ain't got no drawers on!
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Of course you're not all right.
You're having a baby.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Hilary, sweetie, come here.
Having a baby is very spiritual.
This is my last baby and I am never going to experience this miracle again.
Here comes another contraction.
Why, that wasn't so bad.
Hilary, honey, don't be so dramatic.
My hand.
All right, it's cool.
Everything's cool, Aunt Viv.
Everything's cool.
All right, check it out.
Carlton, you boil some water.
Ashley, you go get some blankets.
Hilary, you circle the wagons.
- Will, honey, what are you talking about?
- I wish to God I knew, Aunt Viv.
Mom, I think what Will is referring to is Oh, my God, the pains are getting closer.
Carlton, honey, get up off the floor.
My hand!
What is wrong with everybody?
Philip, pull up your damn pants and let's go!
- Aunt Viv, I wanna go, too.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
You know, I could really use somebody to hold my hand.
- Wonder if Mom had the baby yet.
- I know.
Birth is a miraculous thing, isn't it?
To think I was once inside of a woman's body.
I find that hard to believe.
I think we all do, Carlton.
Hi, Mom.
Mom!
Mom, you're still pregnant.
You think?
- I can't do this anymore.
- Look, me neither.
I mean, getting woke up in the middle of the night by a naked man running around the house.
I'm sorry, I thought you were all asleep.
Not you, G. Oh, never mind.
Look, now, everybody calm down.
False alarms happen all the time.
But Uncle Phil was naked, Aunt Viv.
Shut up, Will.
Vivian, I wanna have this baby already.
You think I don't?
I feel like I ate a Buick.
Look like a Winnebago from here.
Baby, is there anything more I can do for you?
Will you look at her, Uncle Phil?
Haven't you done enough?
Leave her alone.
I'm fine, Philip.
Thank you.
Good, I gotta lay down.
Can I get you some tea, madam?
That would be lovely, Geoffrey.
Bring it to the laundry room.
I'll be sitting on the dryer.
Poor Mom.
Poor Mom?
Poor me.
I saw Uncle Phil naked.
And he was running.
What can I get for you, madam?
Geoffrey, I've got a proposition for you.
Perhaps if we were both younger, and I didn't work for you.
Not that kind of proposition, Geoffrey.
I will give you $50 to drive me over a set of railroad tracks.
Well, Doctor, the pains are coming closer together.
Well, they start in the abdomen and they kind of radiate up and down in all directions.
Philip, what are you talking about?
I'm not having any pains.
Well, I am.
Well, yes, Thursday afternoon will be fine.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, your Majesty?
Geoffrey, from an objective point of view, who is having this baby?
Him or me?
It's rather difficult to tell just by looking.
She's in here.
Look, whatever you do, don't mention her chins.
Or her ankles.
Or her feet.
And whatever you do, never ever feed her after midnight.
Poor Diva.
Look at you.
- I'm sick of this.
- Look at you.
No more, y'all, come on.
No more.
- Will, why are you crying?
- I don't know, man.
Wait a minute, where's Helen?
She couldn't come.
She had to go to court with Lester.
Well, I thought the divorce was final months ago.
That's right and everything was going so well until she saw Lester with another woman and that's when she snatched off the wig.
- She snatched off the woman's wig?
- No, Lester's.
What a novel idea, that little bell.
Geoffrey, would you get us all something to eat, please?
Golly, yes.
It's great to be working in the big house.
You've all met our butler, Chicken George?
Don't you worry, Vivian, I am going to take good care of you.
Me, too.
I'm so happy you guys are here.
I was beginning to feel like nobody understood me.
We're family.
We love you.
Stop with the damn bell!
That's it, I'm never going back up there again.
I'm sorry I ever went up there in the first place.
I took her some honey for her tea.
She tells me she does not want honey from California.
She wants honey from New Mexico.
Please.
Diva needs to get her butt out of Bel-Air a little more often.
If it get any bigger, it'll be in and out of Bel-Air at the same time.
Oh, my goodness.
All right, come on, y'all.
This ain't easy on Aunt Viv.
I mean, the baby is a week late.
All right, that bell is mine.
Who's with me?
All right, Hilary, you act like you're gonna hug her and then pin her arms down.
- I know the chokehold.
- Better.
Hold it, now.
Now, that's enough.
Now, you know this is harder on her than it is on us.
We're her family, we have to be here for her.
You guys, why isn't anybody answering my bell?
Could somebody please come upstairs and keep me company?
You hate me, don't you?
Okay, I know this has been hard to take and this baby does not look like he's coming any time too soon so why don't we just take a breather from one another?
You know, just for a little while.
Hello?
Geoffrey, have you seen my bell?
What bell?
I don't blame you, Geoffrey, I've been pretty unbearable.
Do you think my family is ever gonna come back?
I doubt it.
Why don't you sit down and let me make you some tea?
Geoffrey, you know, you always know what to do.
Now, you relax.
If anything happens, Mr. Banks has Master William's beeper.
And I'm sure your sisters will be back from the salon any minute.
Hilary, this is great.
I really needed this.
I know, and some electrolysis wouldn't hurt you, either.
This could get ugly.
We're family.
Aren't you guys finished yet?
Carlton, Aunt Vy is getting a makeover.
It could take hours.
Am I wearing a "kick me" sign?
I don't see why women spend so much time in these places.
Wow.
Forget college, I'm going to beauty school.
Look, if I'm not back in 20 minutes, be really happy for me.
- Way to go, speedy.
- Shut up.
You know, Will, I could have driven myself here for my examination.
I don't think so, Uncle Phil.
I think you're taking this sympathy pains thing just a wee bit too far.
Don't be ridiculous, Will.
Oh, my God.
I think my water broke.
Oh, my God, it's Vivian.
She's having the baby.
- We gotta get to the hospital!
- Uncle Phil we in the hospital.
Good, 'cause I'm having a heart attack.
Uncle Phil, I think you better let me take care of this.
False alarm, Uncle Phil.
It's for me, it's Carla.
No, Uncle Phil, that's 40, 24, 36.
Shut up.
Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting out that cigarette?
It's a free country.
That's right, it certainly is but it's against the law to smoke cigarettes in elevators.
That's right, boy, this is a New Jack City.
You the man.
You the man.
You the big man that broke the elevator.
Geoffrey, I think we better beep Mr. Banks.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Keep calm.
I think we'd better beep Mr. Banks.
- Geoffrey, I just said that.
- Good, that's good.
Now, we're on the same train of thought.
How do you work this bloody thing?
Thank God you're here.
Oh, God!
Uncle Phil, is that you?
No, but you have really soft hands.
Mommy!
Ma!
Relax, Will.
I'm sure they'll have us out of here in no time.
Uncle Phil, that's Aunt Viv.
Oh, my God, somebody get us out of here!
I'm having a baby!
Something must be wrong.
I've beeped him twice and he still hasn't answered.
My hand!
I'd better try the beauty salon.
So, while she's been stepping out on him he's been having an affair with her sister.
But she works here so keep it quiet.
- Okay.
- What?
Black Beauty, how can I help you?
Yeah, right, it's always an emergency.
I'll ask.
Vy Smith, phone call.
Sorry, nobody's answering.
Don't you just love these quiet girl talks?
What?
I know.
Great.
Geoffrey, it looks like you're gonna have to drive me to the hospital.
Will I steer with my left foot?
I hate men.
Hi, Mommy.
Oh, my God, here comes another one.
Ashley, give me your hand!
- No way.
- Ashley!
- Geoffrey!
- You keep away from me.
This baby's coming.
I gotta get to the hospital.
Don't worry, Mom, I'll get you there.
Ashley, you can't drive.
Grow up.
I've been taking the car since I was 12.
Come on.
How much longer before somebody gets us out of here?
My wife's having a baby.
- She ain't in there with you, is she?
- No.
- Good, 'cause I'm going on a break.
- What?
Just kidding, a little elevator humor there.
Oh, man.
All right, I'll get you out of there as soon as I can.
Hi, honey, I'm gonna be late for lunch.
Great, you have a phone.
That's right, and you don't.
Will, we gotta get that phone.
Look, Uncle Phil, just ask him nice.
No, after what I did to him, he's never going to let me use it.
Well, you know, I'm coming straight out the hood, right?
All right, where I come from when we want something, we step up on it and take it.
Observe.
Please, can I use your phone?
Look, man, if you don't let me use your phone I'm gonna start singing Paula Abdul's greatest hits.
I guess you want to use this phone real bad, huh?
Yes, sir, I do.
About as bad as I wanted that cigarette?
Stop, ghetto time.
No, Will.
Calm down.
No.
Calm down, now.
Now, I trained as a lawyer for many years.
I was trained in the art of negotiation, okay?
Observe.
Sir, give me that damn phone or I'm gonna rip your liver out and eat it raw.
That's right, boy, and he about due for a snack.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Banks.
Mrs. Banks should be arriving at the hospital any minute.
- What?
Who drove her?
- Who drove?
- Yeah.
- You are trapped in an elevator, right?
Yes, yes I'm trapped in an elevator.
Now who drove her?
Miss Ashley drove.
What?
How could you let that happen?
Are you insane?
No, sir, I don't know how I could have let that happen.
Call Mrs. Banks' sisters and tell them to meet her at the hospital.
Yes, sir, I'll call the salon right away.
I am furious at you, Geoffrey!
This is completely irresponsible of you.
Yes, sir, I'm a very, very bad butler.
In fact, I'm going to punish myself.
No phone privileges for a week.
Don't worry, Geoffrey, we're on our way.
Vivian's having the baby.
We've got to get out of here.
- Finally.
I'll go get Carlton.
- Come on, Hilary.
I can't go into a hospital looking like this.
The place is full of doctors.
Hilary, please don't tell me you're that superficial.
Well, it may be superficial to you, but I'm young, I can still get a husband.
Not without any teeth, you won't.
That girl wanted me, Aunt Janice.
Carlton, when a woman says, "Drop dead, troll" it usually means she's not interested.
Now, come on.
I'll call you.
I'm sorry, young lady but you are going to have to fill out these insurance forms like everyone else.
I'm a kid.
I don't know jack about insurance.
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.
Oh, my God, here comes a big one.
Nurse, could you hold my hand, please?
Get this woman to a birthing room.
Dr. Fagin, telephone, please.
What happened to Hilary?
Hilary Violet Banks, get your butt in here.
My hand.
I'm pretty sure Mom has been here.
Look, this is an emergency.
Do you have any mascara?
Where is the woman that did this to you?
Down the hall.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
She's down here.
Vivian, we got here as soon as we could.
You doing okay, baby?
She's fine.
I took care of things.
All right, look, I appreciate that you're a close family but you all can't be in here.
- I'll go.
- Me, too.
This is what I usually look like.
Philip!
Vivian.
Wilma!
Dad, over here.
Where?
Where is she?
- That way.
- Vivian!
Say hello to your new son.
We should get a picture of this.
Doc, would you do the honors?
Sure.
Look, he look like a little black yoda.
- He's adorable.
- Hello, little Nicholas Andrew Banks.
Honey, I thought we agreed to call him Philip.
That's a stupid name.
Why don't we name him after Daddy?
Eli.
- Great.
- No, over my dead body.
- Let's name him Rufus.
- How about Brock?
Shazam!
Smile.
Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.
Wilma!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Hey, what up, C?
- Hey, Will.
Bacon, avocado, and mayonnaise.
Alex, the question is, "What are three things found in Uncle Phil's beard"?
Yuck!
Now, I lost my appetite.
Thanks a lot, Will.
No, thank you, man.
Master William, here are the maps you requested for your road trip.
Thanks a lot, G. University of Nevada.
Where at graduation they don't wear their tassels on their caps, if you know what I'm saying.
You sure are lucky, Will.
Spending the weekend at a college campus with 4,000 hot coeds and you get to bunk with Dad and Sara Lee.
Crocket anyone?
Jazz, you all right, man?
You got a kind of a Clark Kent-Urkel thing jumping all over you.
Actually, Will, he looks like me.
Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.
I'm all ready for my trip to college.
About time, too.
I spent eight years in high school.
Jazz, Uncle Phil is going to be my chaperon and I don't think he wants you to come, buddy.
Well, I guess I better return these stupid, funky clothes.
Here, Carlton.
- Hello, Master William.
- Hey, what's up, G?
Hey, check it out.
I just finished making my schedule for the weekend.
Figure if I work fast, I can see everything that this college has to offer.
This is a list of sororities.
Yes, sir, from alpha to gamma to bad Mama-Jamma.
Silly me.
When I went to university, I actually spent most of my time studying.
Well, yeah, but look at you now, G. Touché.
Did you by any chance see Murder, She Wrote last week?
- No.
- Good.
Watch your back.
- I just love having a little brother.
- Me, too.
Isn't it cute the way he burps and drools and dribbles?
Look, you guys, Carlton's 18 now.
I don't think we should continue to encourage that type of behavior.
We're talking about the new baby.
I never thought I'd actually enjoy taking care of one.
It's for you, Geoffrey.
We better get to the club.
All right, but I draw the line at breastfeeding.
Hey, Uncle Phil, you ready to burn some rubber, make some tracks?
- Cough up a lung?
- No.
It's okay.
I'm fine.
I never felt better.
Call an ambulance.
Whoa, whoa.
Uncle Phil, man, you can't do this to me.
I've been planning this trip for months.
Hey, I tell you what.
Come on, you can make it.
There's a Dodger dog in it for you.
I'm sorry, Will, I don't think I can make it.
No, no, no.
Yes, you can.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
Come on.
Look, Will, you're just going to have to call the university and cancel, that's all.
Uncle Phil, why can't you trust me to go by myself?
Because I'm smarter than the average bear.
All right.
Look, Uncle Phil, if you can't trust me I mean, there's got to be somebody you trust me to go with.
Hey-ho, campers.
Cut it out, Will.
No hijinks while driving, young man.
And fasten that seatbelt.
It's the law.
Yes, sir, Deputy Dawg.
Carlton, did you see that billboard?
Come on, man, I'm starving.
Yes, hello, this is Tony Montana.
I just saw your billboard on the highway.
If you know what's good for you you'll make me a pepperoni pizza with anchovies on it.
Will, what do you think you're doing?
What's it sound like I'm doing?
Yeah, no, we're going north on l-80.
Just look for the little, square-head guy who can just barely see over the steering wheel.
Grow up, Will.
Oh, Carlton, Carlton.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up girls?
Oh, no.
Slow down.
We could use a little roadside assistance, you know?
Will, do you want me to turn this car around?
I want you to speed up and catch up with them girls, man.
That's it, mister, you're on a time-out.
Carlton, man, look.
You really need to loosen up, man.
Look, we're young and we're single.
One of us is really handsome, the other one is you.
But, come on, man, we're kids.
It's our job to act like idiots.
That's your job, Will.
I'm here representing Dad.
My job is to ruin your fun.
And you really love your work, don't you?
What's wrong now?
Look, man, I got to go bathroom.
I'm sorry, but the next bathroom break isn't scheduled for another 33 minutes.
Well, that may be so, but whether you stop or not, I'm going in one minute.
I don't get a good feeling about this place, Will.
It's cool.
I'll take care of it.
We ain't black.
We just got back from Hawaii.
Look, you have exactly 45 seconds to get back from the bathroom.
If you're not back, I'm leaving without you.
Carlton, it may take you 45 seconds but it takes a fully grown man a little while longer.
Yeah, well, you just wasted about 15 seconds, buddy.
- You smell chicken?
- Forget about it, Will.
Rule number 13, no poultry in the car.
Are we there yet?
Will, I think the engine's knocking.
That's not where the engine is, stupid.
Chicken, my brother?
Jazz, how did you get in the trunk?
It was easy.
Oh, by the way, you need a new lock for your garage.
Wow.
College.
Just like I imagined it.
Can I help you fellows?
Yeah, I guess you might as well fill her up.
And wash the windows.
And look under the hood for you know, hood things.
I don't know how people play these things.
They're so boring.
Hey, touch that handle, Granny, and you'll be pulling back a nub.
Hey, Homer.
What's up with the Benz, man?
Well, considering my limited experience with foreign cars this being the first one anyone's actually let me touch I think it went pretty well.
Let me guess.
You have a nuclear reactor in your backyard, don't you?
What do we owe you?
It's $300.
There's $25 for the gas and $275 to call Germany to find out whether it took regular or unleaded.
Yo, man, are you crazy?
Well, I prefer the term "emotionally challenged".
And you still owe me $300.
This guy's scaring me.
Let's just pay him and get out of here.
- Do you prefer a check or credit card?
- Cash.
Well, I've only got $40 cash.
You've got to take a credit card.
I mean, everyone takes credit cards.
What kind of hick are you?
The kind that don't take credit cards.
I'm afraid I'm just going to have to keep the car.
Whoa, whoa.
Homer, Homer, Homer.
Chill, check it out, man, look.
I got $30.
Jazz, how much you got?
Well, between this soda can and what I got in my wallet I'm good for a nickel.
Look, Homer, check it out.
We'll get you your money, man.
We just need a few minutes, all right?
All right, it's no problem.
If you need me, I'll be at McDonald's watching the numbers change.
Great, what are we going to do now?
All right, all right.
Look, let's just think, man.
I'm sure we can come up with something if we just put our heads together.
You got me.
Yes, yes, yes!
Come to Lola.
Coming.
All right, check it out.
We going to get paid right here.
- Carlton, give me your money.
- Forget it, Will.
I will not let you succumb to the base pleasures of gambling.
Besides, we're underage.
Can I get $40 in quarters?
What do you say, Jazz?
You turn my $30 into $300?
Does James Brown use a hot comb?
Jazz, that was our last chip, man.
Don't worry, man.
We got her right where we want her.
Full house.
Yes!
Jazz, you lost all our money, man.
I thought you said you knew how to play poker.
Poker?
You mean this isn't Go Fish?
Tough luck, boys.
Next victim?
Hey, Lola, Lola, baby.
Check it out.
Looky here.
I thought we had an understanding, you know?
I mean, where I come from, when a man is nice to you you don't take all his money.
I mean, at least not while he's still awake.
You're breaking my heart.
Take a hike.
Lola, baby, come on.
I mean, you got to give me a chance to win my money back.
I mean, 'cause if you don't, then I'm not going to be able to get my car.
Come on, baby, have a heart.
I'm just a poor black man trying to get to a panty raid.
All right, look, I'll give you a job.
You can work off your debts.
Like Woodrow here.
Yeah, my Studebaker broke down way back in '78.
I've been working here all this time to pay it off.
Fifteen more years and you can just eat my dust.
Check it out.
Look, Lola I don't want to die here an old white man, okay?
- Will.
- What?
- What?
- Come here.
Excuse me.
What?
I think I got the answer to our problem right here in my sock.
Jazz, ain't nobody going to pay no money to see your sixth toe.
Allow me, my brother.
Yo, you've been holding out on me.
I'm sorry.
Emergency bean-pot fund.
Miss Lola, can I interest you in a game of chance?
I'm listening.
Okay.
I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
- What is it?
- Four.
Damn!
You boys are pathetic.
All right, I'm going to give you another shot, slim.
Double or nothing, high card wins.
All right, you're on.
Black queen.
Something I can relate to.
Scaboom!
A black king, and I don't mean Shaka Zulu.
Thank you.
Quarters.
I have to have quarters, Will.
- Carlton, wait.
- See, I know I can beat it.
- Carlton, listen - First, it was bell, bell, cherry.
- Right.
- And then cherry, lemon, lemon.
- Carlton - But now, it's just cherry, cherry, bell.
Cherry, cherry, bell.
Cherry, cherry, bell!
Every time a cherry, cherry, bell!
Carlton!
Get a grip on yourself, man.
Look, I got the money for the car.
We can leave.
Come on.
No, I can't.
It's this damn thing.
It just sits there taunting me.
"What's wrong, Carlton"?
"Lost your nerve, sissy boy"?
Look, you got to help me, Will.
Make it stop.
- Carlton - Okay, everybody, stand back.
If I apply the Vulcan death grip, and press real hard right here I believe I can make him black out.
Jazz.
Look, look, Carlton.
Listen, if you get in the car right now I promise we can sing the theme to West Side Story, okay?
You can be Maria.
I just want to play a few more times.
Boy, did you hear what I said?
Get your butt in that car right now.
Don't you roll your eyes at me.
I can't leave now, Will.
See, I figured the odds.
If I just play 9,063 more times, I know I can beat it.
Wait, Carlton, Carlton, listen.
This is what gambling does to you, all right?
It's a disease and it's evil.
Stop it.
Right now.
Buzz off, flattop.
Hey, Carlton, I ain't playing with you, man.
- Get your butt in that car right now!
- Why don't you just get off my damn back?
Okay, see, now it's on.
All right, see, my mother don't talk to me like that.
Come on, Jazz, let's go.
I mean, Jazz, we was right for leaving Carlton, right?
Absolutely.
I mean, I've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time.
And there ain't no way that I should miss out on it just cause he got the hots for the slots.
You on a roll with a side of slaw.
I mean, what?
He expect us to babysit him while he have a nervous breakdown?
He's so selfish, man.
That boy put the "E" in ignorant.
I'm just saying, look, it ain't no way I'm letting Carlton ruin this weekend.
Are we slowing down?
I mean, nothing, but nothing, should stand between a man and his Phi Beta booty.
Will, you're only doing 20 over the speed limit.
What's wrong?
Look, didn't I say nothing's wrong, man?
Except the fact that I got a tank full of gas, a campus full of honeys and all I keep thinking about is that little midget we left back there.
Will, honestly, I don't think Ashley wanted to come along.
I'm not talking about Ashley.
I'm talking about Carlton, man.
We left him back there without a friend in the world.
Then he should feel right at home.
Yeah, you know what, I think you're right, man.
He don't need us and we don't need him.
Could luck be a lady tonight?
Tramp.
Michael Jackson impression?
Only a quarter.
Here's 50 cents.
Now, get out of my face.
Cool.
Evening, Bo.
What can I get you?
Shirley Temple.
Hey, no giggling when you bring it to me.
I'll draw your portrait for a quarter.
Yeah!
No!
That's my money.
I've been feeding this machine all night.
Those quarters are mine.
Hey, man, what do you think you're doing?
Get out of my way.
This is my money.
- I don't like your attitude.
- Can it, steroid breath.
What did you say?
See?
He's doing great.
Come on, Bo, now knock it off.
You might break something.
Yeah, like my cousin.
Yo, yo, chill.
What's up?
What's up, man?
Bigfoot here stole my quarters.
Carlton, I'm just guessing here, but name calling?
Bad idea.
Hey, man, you tore my shirt.
My mother bought me this shirt.
And you know, I'm sure she's a really fine woman.
But you got plenty of quarters.
Why don't you go call your mom, have her send you a new shirt?
I don't want a new shirt.
I want to clean the bar with his face.
I'm saying, my brother, pick on somebody your own size.
So what are you saying?
Well, I mean, I wasn't suggesting me specifically.
Bo, now this isn't a fair fight.
Any bets?
I'll take $5 on the big guy.
I'm saying, ain't nobody going to chump me.
I ain't no punk.
You know, Will, you don't have to Look, the time comes when a man has to take responsibility and fight his own battles.
And I'll let you know when the time comes.
Give me $10 on Bo.
Prince, I know how you can take this dude.
How good are you at faking seizures?
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Jazz.
Look, check it out.
Just take the keys, start the engine.
I'm going to bite him and jump in the car.
Let's get busy.
I ain't got all night.
Night/ine is on in two minutes.
Wait a minute.
Can I stretch first, please?
Pull a muscle or something out here.
Anybody got any kryptonite in the house?
Yeah, man, that's real funny.
Really?
So you're not going to hit me?
You're not that funny.
Well, no, but I can be, though.
- That's funny, though, right?
- No.
Whoa, wait a minute, man.
You wait one damn minute!
We brothers, man.
This is crazy.
I mean, we shouldn't be out here about to fight over a couple quarters.
I mean, in this cruel, hard world we got to stick together, man.
Or we done, man.
And if you want to be the brother that casts the first stone for the degradation of the entire race then you go right ahead.
Did you get the feeling back in your head yet?
You say something, Uncle Phil?
Will, I just want to thank you for standing up for me.
Man, look, it was nothing.
What is family for?
Plus, we shouldn't have left you there in the first place, man.
Anything could have happened.
I'm sorry about that.
- Are you crazy?
I had the time of my life.
- What?
Will, for a little while, I was living on the edge.
I, Carlton Banks, recording secretary of the audio visual squad was gambling, swearing, and staying up really, really late.
I mean, I feel so liberated.
Quick, open the back window.
- Yo, for what, man?
- I'm going to moon Nevada.
Bottoms up.
Carlton, come on, put that thing away.
Someone's going to get hurt.
Don't worry, Will.
This is my lucky day.
I knew your butt was going to get us in trouble, man.
University of Nevada, here I come.
Where at graduation I got all this in my mouth.
I'm sorry.
Where at graduation
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Good morning, Daddy.
Morning, sweetheart.
Look, I was thinking, you know, this week, maybe we could get in a game of tennis at the club and maybe do lunch?
- You and me?
- Yeah.
Good one, Daddy.
Hi, kids.
Needy father alert.
Hold it.
Now, what is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Dad, every time Mom goes away you start wanting to do things with us.
It's not fair.
So, what are you kids saying?
What we're saying is, here's $10.
Go to the movies.
Run!
Hey!
Come on now!
You Mr. Smarty Hi, Will, you want to go to a movie?
Sure would, Uncle Phil.
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate that.
Dad?
Hello?
I think we lost him.
Dad's pretty quick for a big guy.
I mean, he kept up with the car for a whole block.
He couldn't help it.
He got his coat stuck in the door.
Wow, Will, clean clothes.
What, is your probation officer stopping by?
No, my buddy, Keith, is coming out from Philly.
I'm going to show him around.
Great, he can hang out with Dad.
Well, actually, you know, Keith is a comic.
He going to be large, too.
He's coming out here, there's a big showcase at a standup club.
Yeah, well, I think I speak for all of us when I say, "So what"?
And I think I speak for myself when I say, "Uncle Phil, they in here"!
All right, who pushed me?
- It was Ashley.
- No, it wasn't.
Well, now, you look.
Now, all I want to do is spend some quality time with my family and running alongside a car is not what I had in mind.
- Uncle Phil - What?
Well, see, I was wondering, since I'm not part of the immediate family - I was wondering if I was immune - Sit down, Will.
I'm gonna sit down right here in the non-immediate family section of the living room.
And I'm gonna shut up on my way down.
Watch.
Now, you listen, and you listen good.
We are a family.
I know this because I pay the bills.
So, we are going to start spending time together.
Lots of time.
Lucky us.
We are going to start acting more like a family.
Do I make myself clear?
Jawoh/, mein Fuehrer!
From now on, we're going to start eating together and laughing together and I'll think of a few more things as soon as I finish watching those Cosby reruns.
Master William there's a young gentleman at the door who thought you might find this funny.
I love my work.
Excuse me, I need to call my therapist.
How are you doing, man?
You ain't got to hit me like that.
Will, aren't you going to introduce us to your company?
Yeah.
Uncle Phil, this is my buddy Keith from Philly, and this is my Uncle Phil.
How are you doing, Mr. Banks?
Nice to meet you.
This is my cousin Ashley, that's Hilary and that's Carlton.
How you guys doing?
Mr. Banks, I want to tell you, I appreciate you letting me stay here for the weekend.
- That was really great of you.
- Excuse me?
Whoa, Uncle Phil I ain't had an opportunity to enlighten you on what's going on here, but Look, Uncle Phil, please, if you let Keith stay here I promise I'll stop making them 976 calls on your car phone.
Okay, if you let him stay I'll take you to Chuck E. Cheese and I'll tell the head rat it's your birthday.
I'll go to an out-of-state college.
Keith, my boy, welcome.
Check it out, man.
I got the new hip joint for you to see.
Damn, man, what is this?
It's the interactive network TV.
Sound like what black people buy when they got too much time on their hands.
- Here, come on, push a player.
- All right.
- Look what's happening.
- Come on, man.
- Aikman hands off to Emmitt.
- Man, come on.
- Look!
- You can do better than that.
Touchdown!
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Man, come on, the game ain't even over yet.
Please, you never could take it when I bust your butt at something.
'Cause you never beat me.
You must be getting old, baby, your mind going.
Let me refresh your memory.
From the time we was in kindergarten, every thing we did I always beat you like you stole something.
Kind of like you just beat me now, huh?
Man, I don't care about this game.
I'm going up to my room, get ready for my big act tomorrow.
All you got to do is stand up there and tell a couple jokes.
Telling jokes See, that's what your drunk Uncle Lou do at weddings.
Me, I'm a professional.
Whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up.
First of all, Uncle Lou is not a drunk, okay?
He has an inner ear problem.
That's why he always be sliding out of his chair.
And, second of all, anybody can get up on a stage and tell a couple jokes.
Why you go and say something silly like that?
There's a craft to this, man.
I take this real seriously.
Please.
Look, I been funny all my life.
All your life you just been funny-Iooking.
I mean, look at them big old ears.
Lean over that way and tell me what's going on in Somalia.
Well, if I couldn't find my way to Somalia, I could follow that big map on your head.
Look at them big teeth, all big and spaced out.
What you floss with, a jump rope?
Wait a minute, was that a professional joke?
- You're damn right.
- Yes, it was.
I think you going to have to pay me to laugh at that one, bro.
- You think you can do better than that?
- Oh, please - Show me, do something.
- All right.
G, check it out.
Can we talk to you for a second?
I'm off duty.
You can talk, but I don't have to listen.
All right, check it out.
Is this funny or not?
- Two gorillas go into a bar, right?
- Not.
All right.
Hey, Will, thanks for the ride.
- You don't have to hang around, though.
- No, I'm cool, man.
Well, you go be funny, I'm gonna go nab me a honey.
- Keith, glad you could make the audition.
- Hi, how you doing?
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Hey, girl you look so good, I'd marry your brother just to get in your family.
Yo, man, you see that?
That's called the l-want-Will walk.
Yo, Keith, come here, man.
Do the chivalry joint.
Come on, you know I'm trying to concentrate.
Do the chivalry joint, man.
Man, come on.
All right.
Hey, girl!
Why don't you stand up and wrap your arms around a real man?
Okay, well, check it out.
I got four words for you.
Ho-li-day Inn.
Come on, girl, you know you want to.
Excuse me, miss, is this abrasive Negro bothering you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he is.
Allow me.
Now, you look here, buddy.
You have no business bothering this sweet young lady.
Now you apologize and don't make me take off my belt.
Not the belt, man.
I'll be cool.
All right, look, I'm sorry, okay?
Now, you get out of her face, now!
Look, miss, I'd just like to apologize on behalf of my gender for his rude behavior.
That's okay.
No, it's not.
He had no reason to act like that.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- Look, could I call you sometime?
- Yeah.
- Call me.
- Thank you.
You.
- Me?
- You a comic?
I don't know you.
Yeah, I'm known all over this town.
I'm Shecky.
Shecky Shabazz.
You're funny, Shecky.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not here for the audition.
You don't have to.
What I saw was good enough.
You're in the showcase.
You're on at 8:15.
Yabba dabba do, I'm in the showcase, too!
- Here you go, big guy.
- Thank you, son.
Hilary, sweetheart, how was work today, darling?
It was great, Dad.
Thanks for asking.
It's wonderful spending time with one's family.
- Daddy.
- Yes, dearest?
I'm feeling nauseous.
I am, too.
Let's take a break, kids.
I think we can forget about those Chinese checkers after the sing-along.
Great.
But the sing-along's still on, right?
Ow!
You're hurting my arms!
- Keith.
- Hi, Mr. Banks.
- Are you all right, son?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I just want to say that it's a pleasure to finally meet one of Will's friends who has his head on straight.
You have been a very positive influence on him, son.
Thank you, sir.
You know, I used to think so, too.
Hey, Uncle Phil you know how you've been staying on me to make some decisions in my life?
Yeah.
Well, hanging with Keith, I've decided what I want to do.
Great.
What is it?
Well, I want to do something that makes a difference and makes people feel good.
That's wonderful.
I want to be a comedian.
Uncle Phil, I don't think "comedian" is a bad word.
It is in this house.
I just spent thousands of dollars sending you to a topnotch prep school.
Maybe I should have just sent you to Camp Funnypants.
Look, I bet Sinbad's parents supported him when he wanted to be a comedian.
They named him Sinbad!
He had two options: Pirate or comic.
Look, Uncle Phil, I know it's a shock but think of all the money you'll save by not sending me to college.
There is no future in it, Will.
Come on, Uncle Phil, can I help it that I'm this incredibly handsome incredibly talented guy with star quality?
Uncle Phil, this thing is bigger than both of us.
Sort of.
I just want you to go to college, that's all.
Uncle Phil, and I will if this doesn't work.
But come on, you got to let me take my shots in life.
You really want this badly, huh, son?
Yes, I do.
And you actually think you can make a success of it?
Yes, sir, I do.
Well, son, I guess there's only one thing for me to do.
I'm going to nail your behind to the floor.
And if I catch you anywhere near a comedy club I'm going to break every funny bone in your body.
Do I make myself perfectly clear?
Perfectly.
Yo, Keith, man, what's up?
What's up?
That's what I've been trying to figure out.
I thought you was my boy.
- I am.
What are you talking about?
- No, you're not.
Not after what you pulled today at the audition.
What, are you mad at me that I got in the showcase?
I mean, I just walked in and the lady gave it to me.
I wasn't going for it.
Yeah, but I was.
And, you got it.
So what's your beef?
You don't get this, huh?
I worked my butt off to get here, man.
You know how many clubs I got booed out of?
How many dives I had to play till I got a routine that finally worked for me?
This ain't nothing but a joke to you.
To me this is serious.
So, what, you asking me to back out?
No, I'm asking you to just show me some respect.
Respect?
I walk through the door and before my butt hit the chair the lady was giving me a job.
You could learn something from me.
Really?
Well, I'll be off-stage taking notes tomorrow night, okay?
You better bring a big pad.
We'll be right back in five minutes with another hot comic.
Well, I guess I'm up next, guys.
Will, I took the liberty of writing out a few humorous barbs that you might find useful.
Listen and laugh.
Did you hear what the snail said when he rode on the back of the turtle?
No, Carlton, what?
Whee!
Now, you should use that one for your big finish.
No, maybe you should try this one.
Why did the turkey cross the road?
I know I'm going to regret this, but why?
Chicken's day off.
Eat your heart out, Rodney Dangerfield.
Hey, I'm giving you gold here.
See, Carlton, this is why people trip you in the halls.
Don't be proud, Will.
Take it.
You'll thank me later.
Carlton, I'm going to be hilarious.
And when I get done with Keith the only job opportunity he's going to have is putting lids on Slurpees.
Ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together for our next comedian from Philadelphia, PA give it up for Will Smith.
What's up?
What's up?
Hey, how y'all doing out there?
I'm a little tired, though, you know.
I had a rough date last night.
I went out with this girl who ain't have no arms.
I took her to The Arsenio Ha// Show and she was like Well, that's cool, check it out, check it out, check it out.
I should be mad at my cousin Carlton, though 'cause he set me up with her.
But he ain't no prize hisself.
He kind of look like a miniature Bryant Gumbel on a bad hair day.
That's cool, check it out.
But actually, my cousin Carlton, he don't have no problem buying clothes 'cause he's so short he just rips them off his G. I. Joe doll and wears 'em right out of the box.
Will's really bombing up there.
We should do something.
Good idea.
Boo!
Get off the stage!
We want our money back!
Go back where you came from!
What's up?
What's up?
Give me that before you hurt yourself.
Give Will Smith a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.
Come on, y'all can do better than that.
Give him a big round of applause.
He'll be back, just not in here.
I hope you're funnier than the last guy.
I know I ain't getting heckled by no Jheri curl.
And you got the nerve to be smoking, too?
What you trying to do, kill us all?
You know, I ain't going to bother no Jheri curl, 'cause I know that plastic bag makes so much noise at night, you're always irritable, huh?
Crumple, crumple.
"I cannot sleep"!
Maybe I better speak to you in your language.
Drip, drip, drip, drip.
I'm new in L.A. I know there's things you can't do.
You can't wear colors.
Can't wear red.
One gang will beat you up.
Can't wear blue.
Other gang will beat you up.
Last night, I thought I was slick and put on plaid.
Two golfers beat the hell out of me, ya'II.
And everybody in L.A. Got a car phone.
Don't matter how messed up the car.
Sometime the phone is the best thing on the car.
You could tell the car raggedy.
Every time the phone ring, the car just cut off.
"Girl, I'm glad you called.
I need a jump.
"Stop calling me or I'll never get home".
But I do this 'cause I want to be rich.
I don't want to be rich for the petty reasons that many of you do.
I want to be rich so I can sleep late.
'Cause when you're broke, you know you got to get up at 6:00 in the morning.
Sometimes you accidentally wake up at 3:00.
"Am I late"?
And black people set their alarm clock so they can hit that snooze button three times.
"That was a drill.
"I'm going to get it right next time".
And now they're saying there's a recession.
Black folks, we didn't know there was a recession 'cause we been broke since the day before forever.
Black folks found a way to get around being broke 'cause we'll put some stuff on layaway, won't we?
And leave it for a long time.
I know brothers still got bell-bottoms on layaway.
You ever left stuff on layaway so long you don't even recognize it when you get back?
"Damn, when did I get an eight-track tape player?
"It's paid for now".
We do, man.
And white folks, you see them in the unemployment office all the time.
"$210 a week?
How the hell am I going to live on $210 a week"?
A brother be right behind him.
"$210 a week?
For nothing?
"Baby, get the kids.
We done come up".
It's basic differences.
They just are.
Like black parents are different than white parents.
No better, no worse, just different.
Saw a movie called Po/tergeist.
In the movie, a little white child trapped in a TV set.
Start crying: "Oh, my God!
Carol Anne's in the TV.
What are we going to do"?
You know, had that been a black mother, she'd have been proud.
Pick up the phone, call her best friend, "Girl, turn to Channel 2.
"My baby's on TV"!
But white people, I love you guys.
Y'all get to do stuff we don't get to do.
White people get to die and come back.
Elvis been dead 15 years.
People still seeing this brother.
When a black man is gone, he's just gone.
You don't see brothers talking about, "Man, I just saw Marvin Gaye!
"He was at the mall"!
"How do you know"?
"I heard it through the grapevine".
You guys have been great.
Thank you very much.
Give it up for Keith Campbell.
- Good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Morning, Will.
I hear your friend Keith really blew them away last night at the standup club.
Man, you should have seen how he handled them hecklers.
I mean, how I heard somewhere that he handled the hecklers.
Don't worry, Will, I know you were there and I'm not going to kill you.
Because I heard you already died a pretty horrible death.
Yo, it was nasty, Uncle Phil.
I guess I ain't as funny as I thought.
I could have told you that.
Ain't nothing you do funny to me.
That's pretty cold, Uncle Phil.
Yeah, well, so is the world if you don't have an education and a good job.
All right, I mean, I learned my lesson, Uncle Phil, but come on.
Look, I'm funny.
All right, here, check it out.
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Amy Fisher.
- Amy - Bang!
Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, I'm on my way to the airport, but thank you guys for all your hospitality.
I appreciate that.
Everybody, except for you, Geoffrey.
You don't think I'm funny, do you?
For a tip I might.
Okay, well, I got a tip for you.
Tails is out.
So are you.
There's the door.
Now, that's funny.
And everybody in L.A. Is a vegetarian.
What is this?
"I don't eat red meat.
I don't eat pork".
You know, it's cool to have a baked potato or a salad every once in a while but at a certain level of hungry, I need something dead on my plate something that used to have horns and hoofs.
And they put parsley on black people's plates.
I asked the waiter, "Man, why you putting parsley on my plate"?
He said, "It's a decoration, it make your plate look pretty".
I'm like, "y o, man, wouldn't an extra shrimp make my plate look even better"?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
You like this, huh?
You like this.
Earthquake!
is a dance, and apparently you know it.
- Exceptional buns, Geoffrey.
- Thank you, sir.
Yes, I think he's been doing the StairMaster.
Where's your mother?
Her breakfast is getting cold.
She's not eating.
Not until she can fit into her old wedding gown.
That's ridiculous.
You wouldn't expect me to fit into a pair of pants I wore 25 years ago.
Or 25 days ago, for that matter.
You know, she has nothing to worry about.
She's as beautiful as the day I married her.
Which is why I'm going to renew our vows this Saturday.
That is so romantic.
I wish I could find a guy to lie to me like that.
Sir, about Saturday's menu shall I prepare the same meal you had at your wedding?
G, how's he supposed to remember what he had for dinner 25 years ago?
Well, we started out with some chicken pot pie and some delicious coleslaw.
And then there was some really, really great baked beans, with, what, molasses.
And for dessert, we had a big huge chunk of chocolate devil's food cake.
I'm guessing.
If only that power could be used for good.
Maybe I'll go upstairs to try to cheer up your mother.
I'm so fat!
On second thought, I'll call her from the car.
Good, he's gone.
Great, now we can finish working on their anniversary surprise.
I hope they like this photo album.
What's not to like?
We got some great family pictures.
Look, here's me at the beach.
And here's me in my carriage.
Look, and here's me at the park.
I knew we should have gotten them those Ginsu knives.
This stuff is so boring.
Carlton's right.
Nothing exciting ever happens to our family.
Well, that's right, y'all, and that's why I came out here 'cause you people really need help.
Carlton Banks is wearing an elegant, yet masculine cotton-silk combination designed by Will St. LeCarlton.
Six, seven, eight and contract, hut.
Five and six and seven, eight.
Fingers open.
Spread 'em out and look.
Contract, release, hut and up and ten and pose, hut, repeat.
Five and six and seven, eight, hut.
Say is that Philip Banks or Blair Underwood?
What do you think of this one, Dad?
I look like Little Richard, attorney at law.
Dinner is served.
A-wop-bop-a-Ioo-bop, a-Iop-bam-boom.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the star of Heidi Comes To Har/em.
Mom, if you make me go to school like this I'm going to write a book when I grow up.
Welcome to the Briny Deep where none of our prices are ever too steep.
We've got fresh fish, you can look in our tank.
To get to the bathroom, make a left at the plank.
Follow me.
Look, I know everyone gets a little silly around mid-terms - but not at the dinner table.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
Will Smith is the scum of the earth.
Hilary!
However, Will Smith is the pinnacle of manliness.
Hilary!
What's with Hilary?
Hilary!
Hilary!
Hilary!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Your Montrose vase attracts dust like a magnet!
G, listen.
Problem solved.
Okay, G, listen.
Philip, I have $1,000 with your name on it.
Do the family a favor, get Viv some cooking lessons.
You!
And, Miss Ashley, how does a Mercedes sound?
Vroom, vroom?
Very clever.
I'll get you two.
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
Nice try.
In case you hadn't figured it out I quit!
For a long time, it gave me nightmares.
Having to witness an injustice like that.
It was a constant reminder of how unfair this world can be.
I can still hear them taunting him.
"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids".
How come they just couldn't give him some cereal?
Hi, /'m Phi/ip Banks, and /'m running for superior court judge.
What the hell is that?
That was our New y ear's Eve party.
Uncle Phil, you know, I just put in a couple of home movies you know, to show your human side.
It gets better, check it out.
And if you put me on the Bench, /'// take a rea/ bite out of crime.
Bite.
Bite.
Bite.
Vote for Phi/ip Banks.
Phi/ip Banks.
Phi/ip Banks.
Phi/ip Banks.
Where's the family room?
Man, I'm going to kill Carlton.
Kill him?
I want to know the name of his decorator.
- No, I'm sorry.
- What do you two think you're doing?
I was trying to get up to my room.
- Tom, what was you doing?
- I was trying to be in the video.
Look, a Donna Karan suit, right in the middle of the kitchen floor.
What color?
You gotta come out to see that.
Sorry, Will, it won't work.
Look, G, she won't listen to me, man.
I give up.
I think it's time you came out of the closet.
Let me.
Sonny what you do in the privacy of the bedroom is nobody's business but yours.
Just be true to yourself.
He'll come around.
Take it off!
Put it on!
Carlton Banks, you put your clothes on this minute.
Mommy!
Wow!
Will, check out the talent.
She's cool.
She's hot.
She's y our baby sister, man!
Carlton's log.
Earth date 1992.
It's 6:00 a.m. Up with the dawn, the small band of brave souls prepare to pile into their Mercedes.
Destination: Adventure.
Hey, I didn't know Mom was a ventriloquist.
Look at that funny-Iooking little dummy on her knee.
Ashley, that's Carlton.
Uncle Phil, what's up?
- Where is it?
- Geoffrey took it, I swear!
Oh, my God, your Aunt Vivian's going to kill me.
Uncle Phil, look, you're winning a lot of points with this second wedding thing.
I'm sure whatever it is, she can handle it.
I lost my wedding ring.
So, where shall we scatter the ashes?
I cannot believe I wore that ring every day for 25 years and the day before my anniversary, I lose it.
Okay, now, just think.
Maybe it will help if you remember what you were doing when you lost it.
I was eating.
That narrows it down.
Hey, what up, J?
Greetings, all.
I guess my invitation to the wedding rerun was misplaced.
But I thought I'd come by anyway.
I'm guessing the bride won't be wearing white.
Jazz, the ceremony isn't till tomorrow, man.
Then I'll be spending the night.
I hear the pool house has a delightful northern exposure.
Hilary, woman, draw me a bath.
I wouldn't draw you a cartoon.
- That's it.
That's it.
I'm out of here.
- Wait.
Jazz, come here, man.
Look, this is not the right time to mess with Uncle Phil.
He lost something really important.
Geoffrey took it.
I swear.
Look, kids, you look down here.
I'm going to look for the ring upstairs.
Give it up, big guy, we've already looked everywhere.
I'll give $100 to the first one who finds it.
Now you're talking.
My family.
Can't live with 'em, can't turn your back on 'em.
Ouch!
Oh, my eye!
Will, are you okay?
Here's your question.
If your partner could name only one person as his best friend who would that special person be?
Now, you have until the buzzer sounds to think about it.
Time is up.
All right, Carlton, let's hear your answer.
Well, Bob, let's back it up for a moment and define this thing called friendship.
You see, the ancient Mayans Carlton, your time is up.
Okay, Tyriq, who is Jazz's best friend?
I'm sorry, Bob, this is a bad time.
- Goodnight, Will.
- You're grounded.
All right, all right, all right.
Everybody out, come on.
Look, the next step is full-scale psychological warfare, right?
You gotta act like you got this tic, right?
Like the army did this experiment on you, right, that just went terribly wrong.
You're like, back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all.
Mind your business.
Okay.
Back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all, just mind your business.
I work all day trying to keep this house nice for you.
I cook and clean and work my fingers to the bone.
And this is the thanks I get?
Well, I bust my hump at school all day and you just sit around here watching soap operas and eating bonbons.
Well, excuse me for having a little fun.
Maybe it's because you never take me out anymore.
Well, maybe I would if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
Wait a minute.
We sound like an old married couple.
So now I'm old.
And I gave you the best years of my life.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm hungry.
Don't you have any more breath mints?
No, you ate them all without offering me one.
- Can't have my toothpick, either.
- Did I ask you?
Look, baby, why don't you just look in the freezer and see if there's something in there?
- Would you look?
- Why don't you look?
I thought you liked doing things for me.
Yes, I did till you ate all my breath mints.
Forget it, I don't need you to do anything for me.
Could you open this?
Thought you ain't need me to do nothing for you.
Just open it.
- What's the magic word?
- Now.
Guess again.
Here, look, I can't open this thing.
I thought you're supposed to be the big man.
Look, you're the one who's hungry.
Use your fingernails.
Look.
Here.
Knock yourself out.
Any luck with the ring, Dad?
No, but don't worry about it, I figured it out.
In the middle of the ceremony, I'll fake a heart attack.
Come on, Uncle Phil, it didn't work on your wedding night and it ain't going to work now.
Here comes Hilary.
Places.
She looks so beautiful.
Thank you.
Not you.
Mom.
Look, she fit into her wedding dress.
Everybody, duck.
I think she's about to blow.
Jazz!
We're gathered here today to renew the vows of holy matrimony which is commended - I didn't know you were so sentimental.
- I'm not.
It's just, always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
Vivian Banks, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
With all my heart.
And do you, Philip Banks, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- No, I don't.
- What?
I take her for much more than that.
For my lover my life companion my very best friend.
Oh, Philip.
May I have the ring, please?
- Here it is, Daddy.
- I got one for you right here, buddy.
Thanks, kids, but Look, Vivian, there's something I have to tell you.
I lost my wedding ring.
You mean this one?
You found it!
Yeah, I took it to have it inscribed.
See, look.
"To a hundred years more".
Now you may kiss the bride.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Daddy, can we take Nicky with us to graduation?
No, I don't think so, sweetheart.
But maybe Geoffrey can baby-sit for him.
Of course, sir.
And, no, I wouldn't mind missing the ceremony.
Why should I be invited to such an illustrious event after a mere 15 years of wiping, picking and sucking up after you all?
Geoffrey, we would love for you to come to graduation with us.
I'll have to check my book.
Geoffrey, you're coming.
But you know, your mother's not feeling well and I don't feel right leaving Nicky with a stranger.
I could take care of him.
Yeah, but who's going to take care of you?
Yeah, come on, Hilary.
Plus, you can't miss the ceremony hard as I've worked to graduate.
Man, you know how hard it is to take a test like this?
Guess what?
I'm the class valedictorian.
What does that mean?
I believe it's Latin for "little short midget with a square head".
Now what was Antonio Vivaldi trying to tell us in this concerto?
Come on, baby, I'm saying, "Bing-bang- bluesy, me and you in the Jacuzzi".
What's up?
Mr. Smith.
The concerto?
What was Vivaldi saying?
Well, actually, Mrs. Bassin, I'm glad you asked me that.
Vivaldi, or "Vival Dee" as it is pronounced in some European circles I believe he was commenting on man's inhumanity toward man.
That we citizens of America, the richest country on this planet have a moral obligation that goes far beyond buying the newest car or purchasing the latest Naughty By Nature CD.
If one child goes hungry we must feed it.
If one child shivers we must shelter it.
And I, for one believe the brother knew what he was talking about.
Vivaldi died in 1741 before there was a United States.
But the dream is alive.
More on Vivaldi tomorrow.
Mr. Smith, may I have a word with you, please?
- Yes, I was just - Mr. Smith.
Mrs. Bassin, I'm sorry, I was acting silly today.
I'll make it up tomorrow.
Too little too late.
Will, I'm going to have to fail you.
The "F" word.
Why?
You missed half the semester.
What's your point?
Will, you have 10 classes to make up and only five before graduation.
Listen, Mrs. Bassin, I'm telling you, I'll make up the work.
Come on, I have to graduate.
I'm sorry, but you have no one to blame but yourself.
Listen, Mrs. Bassin I don't think you understand.
My Mom is flying out from Philly to see me graduate.
I mean, the woman that gave me life.
And if I don't graduate, she'll take it back.
Listen, I'll make up the work.
You don't have time.
And besides, there's no way you could keep up with my accelerated class.
It's over.
Look, Mrs. Bassin, listen, come on.
This is me.
I'm sinking.
Please give me another chance.
Please?
Come on.
All right, be here tomorrow at 5:00.
- Yes - But no promises.
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Bassin.
Wait a minute.
Batman comes on at 5:00.
Can we make it at 6:30?
- I'm joking.
I'm stupid.
- I know.
So, Janine, when did you first decide you wanted to take care of children?
When I was so instructed by the Lord of the Eighth Circle.
So, Lindsay, when did you first decide you wanted to take care of children?
I guess, shortly after my release.
Please!
What do you know about taking care of babies?
Babies?
I'm here to take care of Hilary.
Hey, did my Mom get here yet?
Geoffrey's picking her up from the airport.
Will, I've been meaning to ask you.
What do you want for graduation?
Would you all stop with the interrogation, please?
Obviously, some of us can handle the pressures of graduation better than others.
Pressure?
Look, man, I'm not feeling no pressure, okay?
Thank God you're not giving the speech.
It's an immense responsibility one I face with great humility.
But do I shirk it?
No.
Because somehow deep down I know anyone else would really bite.
Gosh, Carlton, you're so confident.
I'd be too nervous to be valedictorian.
Nervous?
Why?
Why?
I mean to have all those people staring at you.
I mean, people stare at me all the time, but I'm pretty.
I guess that spandex shirt don't got nothing to do with it, huh?
Aren't you afraid you're going to mess up?
Not a problem.
Well, I'd be worried.
Yeah, every kid hoping you make a fool of yourself, every parent wondering what you're doing up at the podium and why you're sweating so much?
Yo, C, come on, man, you ain't got to worry about none of that.
But I would worry about slipping off them stack of phone books you going to be standing on.
Heck, you guys.
Heck!
You're very, very brave.
We're so proud of you.
Oh, God, I'm short, I'm sweaty and I can't grow chest hair.
Oh, my goodness, is that a bald spot?
Oh, there he is, my graduate!
Hey, Ma.
You're my pride and joy, sweetie.
This means everything to me.
I never thought I'd live to see this day, but here I am and there you are.
Now, smile and say, "diploma".
Look, Mom, this is just a little graduation.
I think you're making a little too much of it.
Boy, are you crazy?
I've been waiting Come on, Mom, you must have done something else in all that time.
Nothing more important than this.
Apparently, you've never danced the Achy Breaky.
Will, completing high school was a great achievement.
You've made me so happy I could cry.
Yeah, me too.
Boo!
Will, where have you been?
I haven't seen you in music class.
You ain't heard?
Mrs. Bassin brought me up to her advanced class.
You know, Will, you are so talented.
Yeah, and I'm pretty good at music, too, you know?
- Don't be silly.
- Get on out of here before I do something.
Will, you made it.
Class, say hello to Will.
He'll be joining us until the end of the semester.
Great.
Another high school dropout.
Okay, now, before we start our scales can anyone tell me what "pizzicato" means?
Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith?
You got all these Sure pizzicato, that's a pizza with avocado.
Get it, I said, it's a pizza Michael.
Pizzicato: A term indicating that strings should be plucked, not bowed.
Well, there ain't no Santa Claus.
Another slice for you, Master William?
No thanks, G, I'm not hungry.
That's funny.
Wi// a/ways has seconds at home.
G I am this close to not graduating, man.
I think my music teacher has got it out for me.
She's trying to force me to make up 10 hours.
Come on, it ain't like I got a future in music or nothing.
Well, I sincerely hope you graduate.
Thanks a lot, G, that means a lot to me.
Because if you're left back and I have to wash your gym socks for another year I shall take my own life.
Surprise!
Look, Mom, what is this?
Your four-days-before-graduation gift.
Look, Mom, this has got to stop.
There wouldn't happen to be no car keys in here would there?
- No.
- Then this has got to stop, Mom.
I know, I'm getting a little carried away, but I'm just so proud of you.
Your graduation is very important to me.
But, Mom, it wouldn't be if you got out more.
- I know what's going on here.
- You do?
You're trying to downplay graduation because you don't want me to feel bad that I never got a chance to graduate.
Oh, God, my life is over.
I wish I'd never been made valedictorian.
Carlton, come on, you're going to do fine.
Now, when you're up there, just picture someone that you really admire watching you with love and approval.
Go on, try it.
It's no good.
The only thing I can picture is someone laughing and pointing at me.
Carlton, now you stop that man, that is not going to happen to you when you give that speech.
That's going to happen to you on your wedding night.
Okay, kids, today we're going to choose up teams and play musical jeopardy.
Now, who wants to be our two captains?
Right here, Mrs. Bassin.
Nancy and Michael.
Two players left.
Make your choice.
Come on, man, you got to pick me.
All right, stop your whining.
Now for the final question the answer is: A clef.
I know!
What is that thing Michael Jackson had built into his chin?
Nancy.
What is the character that indicates the pitch of a particular line on a staff?
That's right.
Congratulations.
- Yes!
- Your team wins.
- What are you looking at?
- Not much.
Look, man, we can take this out to the monkey bars.
Any time, any place.
I'm just kidding, you're the man.
Okay, students, don't forget to get here early tomorrow so you can be measured for your costumes for the recital.
- Recital?
- That's right.
Mrs. Bassin, my sister, listen I appreciate everything you're trying to do for me, but look I am not about the embarrass myself in front of a group of strangers.
Mr. Smith, my brother you're not going to embarrass yourself in front of a group of strangers.
That's what I said.
You'll be performing for your friends at graduation.
Are you tripping?
No way.
Then you won't be able to graduate, I'm afraid.
Then I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to sign your yearbook!
Look, all right?
Now, I know the two of you are upset about me not graduating, okay?
But you'll get over it.
You'll have to.
All right?
'Cause I made up my mind and nothing either of you can say is going to change that.
Okay?
'Cause I'm a man.
All right?
With strong man emotions.
And there is no way that this man is going to get up on that stage and embarrass himself at graduation.
No.
Good luck, sweetie.
I'm so proud of you.
Mama's boy.
Okay, kids, I'm going to announce you.
So, take your marks.
Where are you guys going?
Come on, don't you guys want to go out there and see Uncle Willie make a fool out of himself?
What's wrong?
Those are people out there.
All this time y'all thought we was going to be performing for some Smurfs?
Okay, come on, look, let's just pretend it's another rehearsal.
Forget it, we're not ready for the public.
How do you think I feel?
We've got our futures to think about.
Listen, I don't think you guys understand.
If we don't get out there, I'm not going to graduate.
You're breaking my heart.
And you're so cute.
And if you guys don't let me graduate, then I might have to mess y'all up.
Show on!
Today for your listening pleasure let us welcome the Little Rays of Sunshine.
That's my Jessie, the one with the braids.
That's my Will, the one with the mustache.
Hey, Mike, can we get a little James Brown?
I didn't hear you.
I said, "Can we get a little James Brown"?
Now, here we go.
Say, Maestro, can we get a little walking music?
Posse out!
Thanks, Will, you got us through a tough one.
Okay.
I guess that means you're noticing how truly fly I am.
Speaking of flies, yours is open.
A tutu fly.
Well, Will - congratulations.
- Thank you.
You can walk with your classmates.
I'm passing you.
- Hey, thanks a lot, Mrs. Bassin.
- You're welcome.
And trust me, I learned a valuable lesson from this.
What's that?
I ain't never having no kids.
Good luck.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
Hey, Will, I caught your act.
Baby, listen, check it out, I can y ou know, you really surprised me.
That was the most sensitive, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
And nothing turns me on more than sensitivity in a man.
Oh, girl, you don't know the half of it.
Let me tell you I be boo-hooing during Lassie.
Before / came here today, / was afraid as /'m sure many of you are.
/t seems these days, there's a /ot to be afraid of.
The wor/d can be a pretty scary p/ace.
But how can one person make a difference?
We//, /'// te// you what /'m going to do.
/'m going to take the education / received here and use it to give back to those /ess fortunate.
Your cousin's really deep and he doesn't even seem nervous.
Yeah, see, check it out.
I gave him a little advice.
I told him to picture somebody that he really admires.
And, you know, he probably picturing me.
And in c/osing /'d /ike to thank my teachers and my c/assmates for four great years.
And my fami/y for their /ove and support.
And, my best friend someone who stuck beside me and kept me out of troub/e and maybe got me into a /itt/e bit of it, too.
Congratu/ations.
Lisa Armstrong.
Adam Baker.
Car/ton Banks.
John Simpson.
Wi// Smith.
Now, when you're up there, just picture someone that you really admire watching you with love and approval.
Go on, try it.
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
I'm sorry.
