{START OF EPISODE 1}
Just let me check.
Her 16th birthday started five minutes ago.
Oh, look, Hilda.
She's levitating.
Right on schedule.
Let's wake her up and tell her she's a witch.
No, let her sleep.
She starts a new school tomorrow.
Besides, the first levitation is so special.
Yeah.
But then it gets old real quick.
I can't believe our little niece is growing up.
Wait till Sabrina finds out what new doors this will open for her.
Wait till she finds out you still get Zits when you're 600 years old.
Well, we'd better go before she wakes up.
So sweet.
So innocent.
Just the perfect little witch.
This is so not me.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Happy birthday, Sabrina.
- And many more to come.
- Many, many more to come.
I got you a little something.
Actually, that's from both of us.
I just forgot to sign the card.
Hope you don't already have one.
A black pot.
Actually, I don't.
Thanks.
- It's a cauldron.
- Wow.
Even better.
I can put my pens in it.
That's not what it's for.
Sabrina, we have something to tell you.
You see, there are two realms: the natural and the supernatural.
And it turns out that the immutable laws of-- You're a witch.
- What do you mean, I'm a witch?
- You're a witch.
Now, you're not alone.
I'm a witch.
Hilda's a witch.
Your father's a witch.
And I suppose my mom's a witch too?
- I always thought so.
- Actually, your mom's mortal.
You see, that's why you're here.
So that we can teach you to use your magic.
You know, for a second there, you almost made me forget about my first day of school.
Thanks.
But now I've gotta go catch a bus to take me to my doom.
Bye-bye.
Have fun.
And don't make too many hand gestures.
My aunts try hard.
But you have to admit.
They're pretty weird.
You have no idea.
Summer's over.
Come on in.
I'm Mr. Pool.
And I know you were hoping I was gonna spend the day mispronouncing your names, but instead, let's just jump right into biology, huh?
The frog is a cold-blooded vertebrate.
As we dissect this amphibian, we'll be looking for the kidneys, the heart and my lost youth.
So if you'll each choose up a lab partner Or I could pair you off by height.
Thank you.
- Hey, you want to-- - Harvey.
I'll be your lab partner.
Let's name him Tad.
- Tad Pole.
- Okay.
Hey, thanks for asking me to be your lab partner.
I know what it's like.
I was the new kid last year.
So can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel like you don't fit in?
Only all the time.
But I don't want to fit in.
I researched it, and awkward people tend to be much more successful later in life.
I look at Libby, I see tragedy.
Oh.
Look, girls, you bored your frog to death.
Well, slice and dice.
Ugh.
I hate doing this.
If only there was some way I could bring these frogs back to life.
I think his heart is some around here.
Look, Tad's alive.
How'd that happen?
Ha.
It's Frankenfrog.
Hey.
Mr. Pool, ours is still kicking.
Mike from Cadaver Shack's gonna hear from me.
Can you believe how young the freshmen look?
May we help you?
I just wanted to wash my hands.
You know, frog juice.
You know, if you stink, I'm not sure it's fair to blame the frog.
Well, at least I don't splash on aftershave to remind me of some boy who dumped me last summer.
How'd you know that?
I don't know.
My incredible sense of smell told me?
- Heh.
Yeah, right.
- Well, I better get going.
Smell you later.
Wait.
Don't come in here again.
From now on, you use the freaks' bathroom.
Oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, ah!
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah!
Hi, I'm home.
Where is everyone?
Surprise.
Oh, look, a party.
Sort of.
Oh, look, you put Salem in a little party hat.
That's so cute.
Here is a present from your father.
An old book.
A black pot.
Doesn't anyone shop at the Gap anymore?
"The Discovery of Magic".
Why'd he give me this?
Oh, that's why.
This old magician looks just like my dad.
Surprise.
It is your dad.
Happy birthday, Sabrina.
Wow, Hallmark has gone really high-tech.
- Can he say anything else?
- I'm not a hologram, honey.
- I'm just in a different realm.
- Different realm?
I thought you were at the Toronto Midway Motor Lodge.
Zelda?
Hilda?
Didn't you explain to her she's a witch?
She doesn't believe us.
Not this again.
Look, I know you went to a lot of trouble to set this joke up, so: Ha-ha-ha.
- Now it's over.
- No, it's just beginning.
You are a witch.
With real magical powers.
And now that you're 16, you can use them.
And you wanted something from the Gap.
So, what are you saying?
That I'm not who I think I am?
You're not who I think you are?
And my father lives in a book?
- Ugh.
Finally she gets it.
- This is insane.
I'm going to my room.
Come on, Salem.
Can you wait till I finish my milk?
- Did the cat just talk?
- Yes.
- And get this stupid hat off my head.
- Oh, my God.
I think we better let her father handle this.
Ted.
EDWARD : Open me up.
- No.
- We have to talk.
Young lady, you open me up this instant.
No, I don't want to talk to a book.
Oh, God, I'm talking to a book.
I can't be a witch.
Witches don't exist.
Honey, I know this is hard, but you just have to accept it.
You're not like other kids.
You're special.
I don't wanna be special.
I wanna be normal.
I understand, but that ship has sailed.
None of this makes sense.
All these years I thought you were travelling with the foreign service.
I am.
It's just a lot more foreign than you thought.
And mom?
Has she really been digging for fossils in Peru?
Yes, she is.
- Then I wanna go live with her.
You can't.
You see, there's a rule.
If you set eyes on your mother in the next two years, - she'll turn into a ball of wax.
- What?
It's the way they discourage mortal-witch marriages.
So is that the reason why you and mom got divorced?
No.
So do you think maybe you could get back together?
No.
That's another ship that sailed.
You're gonna be fine.
Just take some time and think about all this.
And if you ever need me, I'm in the index.
I call.
- Five aces.
- You cheat.
- Do not.
- Do too.
- Do not.
- Okay.
I've talked to my dad.
And I've thought about it.
And I guess I believe I'm a witch.
Good.
Because you are.
Hey, you know what?
Let's try some magic.
Sabrina, you stand right there.
Hilda, you stay there.
All right, let's start with the basics.
Orange into apple.
Now, you concentrate and point.
Come on, try it.
Apple, pineapple.
That's very close.
No, it's not.
Try again.
I'm not very good at this.
You told me the 23rd time is the charm.
You'll learn to control your magic.
At the very least, you'll always be able to garnish a ham steak.
One more try.
- Salem into apple.
- I think that's enough for one night.
The cat's right.
Wrap it up.
You've got school tomorrow.
I'm a witch and I still have to go to school?
- Mm-hm.
- Unfair.
Hey, maybe I'll turn Mr. Pool into-- No.
Now, be careful pointing your finger at people.
It could be dangerous.
- You're pointing at me.
- I have the safety on.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Pineapple?
- You're gonna be late.
So?
I'm a witch.
- Can't I just turn back time?
- Uh-uh.
No, a witch can't change time.
That's one of the rules.
- You're kidding?
- No.
- Gotta go.
- You also can't get rid of cellulite.
I got a joke.
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Brad.
- Brad who?
Brad Pitt.
Is there any other Brad worth mentioning?
Thank you for coming.
Did you enjoy that pop quiZ?
- Heh.
I am so bad at history.
- Me too.
How are we supposed to remember things happened long ago?
Heads up.
Watch it with the football.
Are you okay?
Try to live in this world.
Not just your own.
Freak.
- Ahem.
Can I sit here?
- Sure.
- How's your head?
- Oh, it kind of hurts.
I'm sorry.
You know, I didn't mean to hit you with the football.
Oh, that was you?
- You have a really good arm.
- Heh.
Thanks.
- Heh.
- Oh, do you know Jenny?
You live in the house with the funny mailbox, right?
It's not our fault.
The people who lived there before us were actually named Mr. and Mrs. Hogg.
No, it's cute.
My mailbox is boring.
- It's really just a place to put letters.
- Mine too.
Hi, Harvey.
I'm having a party Saturday night.
You'll be there, right?
- Sure.
I'm not doing anything else.
- Perfect.
Everyone cool is coming.
Well, that's all.
Oh, no.
- Smell you later.
- You did that on purpose.
Prove it.
Don't walk away.
I mean it.
I'm not done talking with you.
You.
You.
Twister.
Everybody hit the dirt.
Where did Libby go?
I have no idea.
Oh, goodie.
There's a lecture at MIT on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
It's either at 8 or at 10.
I hate being a witch.
I just turned the most popular girl in school into a pineapple.
- Why?
- It's the only thing you taught me.
Chill.
I can fix this.
Chunks or rings?
- Hilda, there are other ways.
- Wedges?
Sabrina doesn't know how to seal her spells yet, so  The popular girl is not a fruit There.
All better.
What am I doing in your house?
You came over for a visit.
Ha, ha.
I would not.
You did something to me.
You sent me somewhere.
Ooh!
It was small and it smelled like Hawaii.
Look, Libby, I'm sorry.
I didn't-- Not as sorry as you will be.
You're an even bigger freak than I thought and the whole school's gonna know about it.
See, my way, she'd be on a toothpick.
It's over.
My life is over.
I mean, it's not just over, it's "over" over.
Oh, stop.
Libby can't hurt you.
She's just one person with a craZy story.
She's a cheerleader.
Nobody has more credibility.
Only way to make this better would be to turn back time.
- And you said a witch can't do that.
- A witch can't.
But collectively, we do have powers that a single witch doesn't.
It's a union thing.
So it's possible?
You can appeal to the Witches' Council but they only grant time reversal in extreme cases.
Like, for two months, a bunny ruled all of England.
- When?
- See?
Well, how do I get to this Witches' Council?
It's ten million light years away.
But there's a shortcut through our linen closet.
Now, the head of the Council is named Drell.
He's a mean, pigheaded, power-mad despot.
We used to date.
- I haven't seen him in centuries.
- Not since he left her at the altar.
Daddy lost a huge deposit on the Parthenon.
Would you let that go?
It's ancient history.
I knew Drell was bad news.
I didn't want that big wedding with the long white-- Excuse me.
I'm trying to turn back time here.
- Can we go?
- Oh, no.
I couldn't.
I swore I would never talk to Drell again as long as he lives.
Besides, the Council will respect you more if you go alone.
Now, make a left at the towels and follow the signs.
And watch out for Drell.
And whatever you do, don't stare at his mole.
Oh, sorry.
Is this the Witches' Council?
Yes.
I don't believe you have an appointment.
Drell, did you remember to feed the candle?
There.
Happy?
I know I don't have an appointment, but I brought a washcloth.
Okay, state your name, age and request.
We'll see if we can fit you in.
I'm Sabrina, I'm 16, I'd like to turn back time.
Denied.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, we fit you in.
Next order of business.
Are you staring at my mole?
No.
I just didn't get a chance to explain why I wanted to turn back time.
- Let's humour her.
- Okay, speak.
But quickly.
Okay, where do I start?
Well, you know, from the moment I started my new school, I didn't fit in.
I wore the wrong shoes, which may seem like nothing, but kids can be so judgemental.
I said, quickly.
Libby spilled grape soda over me.
That's why I turned her into a pineapple.
You don't know this girl.
She can turn the school against me.
It's hard enough knowing that you are a freak without everyone else knowing it too.
Oh, the problems of teenagers are so interesting.
We'll review your case, then we'll get back to you.
- But I need to know.
- And you will.
Now, go.
And don't let the time-space continuum hit you on the way out.
You love me, don't you, huh, Moley?
Salem, do you think the Council will grant the time reversal?
I'm the wrong witch to ask.
They weren't very lenient with me.
Sentenced to a hundred years as a cat.
And for what?
I don't know.
For what?
Oh, like any young kid, I dreamed of world domination.
Of course, they really crack down when you act upon it.
Wow.
No wonder you're so possessive of the sofa.
Mm.
It would have been glorious.
Me, as the firm-but-just emperor of Earth.
Trust me, being a house pet wasn't even plan B. Come on, it's not that bad.
You take 5000 naps a day.
I can't go dancing.
I can't play squash.
The sound of the can opener is the only thing that make me feel truly alive.
Salem, would you like your rubber mouse?
Please.
Any word from the Witches' Council?
Not yet.
And if I'm going to school, I have to leave any second.
- That's it.
- That's it?
Careful, don't burn your fingers.
Please, please, please.
DRELL : Request denied.
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm sorry, honey.
It's okay.
Where are we moving?
I hear Greenland's a groove.
Get your books.
You're gonna be late.
You don't understand, Aunt Hilda.
I'm not going to school.
Oh, yes, you are.
You can do this.
You can't go through life being afraid of things.
- Toughen up.
- But everyone will laugh at me.
- Toughen up.
- So that's my choice?
Toughen up or toughen up?
Aunt Zelda, will you help me?
Oh, you know I hate to say it, but Aunt Hilda's right.
I mean, who cares what the other kids say?
Actually, Libby thought I was a freak even before this happened.
See.
Fine.
I surrender.
I guess every school needs a weird kid.
- Might as well be me.
- I was the weird kid.
They don't "tar and feather" anymore, do they?
I hated that.
You know whose fault this is?
That jerk, Drell's.
Just a thought, but I bet you could convince him to change his mind.
Me?
I don't think so.
Besides, Sabrina's going to be fine.
Yes, she'll be ostraciZed and reviled.
But she'll get over it.
The wounds will heal, the scars will fade.
You know I can't face Drell.
Toughen up.
It's payback time, Drell.
I'm coming in.
Hilda, what are you doing here?
Oh!
Get your hands off my mole.
Hey, I got a joke.
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Brad.
- Brad Pitt.
You told me that joke yesterday.
No, I didn't.
I just heard it on the bus.
Really?
Excellent work, Sabrina.
I cannot believe you aced the pop quiZ.
Well, what can I say?
I just love history.
Heads up.
BOY 1: Nice catch.
GIRL 1: All right.
- Ahem.
Can I sit here?
- Sure.
That was a great catch.
I was in the Zone.
Do you know Jenny?
You live in the house with the funny mailbox, right?
Before we get into that, if you're not doing anything Saturday night, would you see a movie with Jenny and me?
Sure, that sounds like fun.
- Cool.
- Cool.
Cool.
So you were saying about mailboxes?
Hi, Harvey.
I'm having a party Saturday night.
You'll be there, right?
Sorry.
I just made plans.
Aw.
Bubble burst.
And I bet you wanted everyone cool to come.
I love being a witch.
I don't know what made the Council change their minds, but I got to do the whole day over again.
And now the teachers think I'm smart, the jocks think I'm cool.
Oh, and I'm going to the movies with Harvey and Jenny Saturday night.
Whoo-hoo!
I'm normal.
Gotta go tell the cat.
- Teens.
- What about them?
Just in general.
Salem.
I don't play squash, but how about a dance?
And once I controlled Eurasia, I was going to advance on-- Oh, Salem, can you hold that thought?
I'll be right back.
I gotta get some more milk.
Stay where you are.
You're a witch.
Look under the M's.
Wow.
Magic milk.
Cool.
It worked.
Hey, I could get used to this magic.
Hey, share.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I don't get it.
I've been studying my magic book and it's just too hard.
- Oh, here, let me help you.
- Ah.
Here's one for silence.
"Affix the taste organ of a humped ruminant adjacent to one's dentation".
- I have no idea what that means.
- It means: put a camel tongue in your mouth.
It works, but you find you find out why camels spit so much.
I think I'd actually rather be doing my homework.
Sabrina, magic is part of your education too.
Sure, it's hard work and it might seem difficult at times, but with plenty of practise-- Oh, why don't you just get a straw and suck all the fun out of it.
Oh, you are going to love this section.
"Magic for Dummies"?
Try this one.
It's a hoot.
Oh, it's great at parties.
Oh, please.
That's the oldest trick in the book.
- That's so old, mortals are doing it.
- Let me try.
Okay, here goes.
Abracadabra Hey, it worked.
I pulled a rabbit out of a hat.
Hey, put me back.
My wife, Renee, is about to give birth.
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, relax.
That happens a lot with rabbits.
I didn't know.
As if.
Morning, Salem.
Maybe for you.
I'm having a bad fur day.
- Poor kitty.
What's wrong?
Couldn't sleep last night.
Tried reading the most boring thing I could find, but not even your diary could do the trick.
How did you read my diary?
It's locked.
I picked it with my dewclaw.
So who's Harvey?
- He's no one.
Yeah.
No one with the world's most perfect sideburns.
- That's enough.
Harvey and Sabrina, Harvey and Sabrina, Harvey--  Hey, look, toast.
Good morning.
I've got great news.
Guess who's going out with the head of the Witches' Council tomorrow?
I'll give you a hint.
I don't believe it.
You're going out with Drell?
The big ugly guy with the mole?
Yes, and I'm so excited.
Oh, Hilda, don't.
Excitement brings hope.
What's wrong with hope?
Every time he makes a date with Hilda, he breaks it.
He did that once or twice or maybe a thousand times.
But may I remind you that every time that Drell has cancelled, he has always sent me a lovely token of his affection.
- Yeah, he always sends a pot roast.
- Pot roast?
Flowers wilt, say it with beef.
Well, I'd love to stay and listen to more tales of romance and meat, but I've got school to ruin my day.
See you.
Harvey and Sabrina--  Now, the use of the cloth napkin exploded in the early 19th century.
And since there was no TV, napkin folding became a popular art form.
Let's start with the Bishop's Mitre.
Why do we have to learn this?
In case our cable goes out?
I think Libby and her friends are talking about us.
No, they're not.
Don't be so paranoid, Jenny.
Paranoid?
They're pointing at us and laughing.
Oh, you're right.
Well, just ignore them.
Are they still doing it?
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi, Harvey.
I'm having a little trouble with the Bishop's Mitre.
The best I can do is a snowball.
- I can help.
- I'll supervise.
The only reason I took Home Ec was so I could eat during class.
Coach says I still have to bulk up and carbo-loading can get pretty lonely.
We'll keep you company any time you have to eat.
Yeah, we're good at that.
I'm going to the piZZa place tomorrow night to force down slices.
- You guys wanna watch?
- Sure.
Cool.
- Cool.
- Cool.
Bless you.
Oh, that'll be fun, hanging out with Harvey.
- That'll be a lot of fun.
- Just the three of us.
Okay, pointy ends-- Do you ever wonder what Harvey's thinking about - when he's looking out the window?
- Probably football?
No, no.
I bet he's thinking about nature.
Or poetry.
- Or the poetry of nature.
- I'm sticking with football.
Oh, he's so quiet.
I wish I knew him better.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather go alone with Harvey?
- Just the two of you?
- No.
Would you?
- No.
I just like him as a friend.
- Me too.
Need help, Sabrina?
Well, I can't really do that Bishop's thing, but I did make a rose.
Oh, look, here comes our fan club.
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Sabrina.
Hey, is there something funny about our names?
Not Jenny's.
Why don't you guys leave us alone?
We're not bothering you.
You're still breathing, aren't you?
Freak.
Double freak.
We can't let her get to us.
That's what she wants.
I just wish I knew what she was saying.
Well, what difference does it make?
Everything Libby says is a lie.
Hey, maybe we could retaliate by spreading lies about her.
What can we say, that she's actually nice and sweet?
- Not much revenge in that.
- No.
Face it, the world would be a much better place if everyone told the truth, but you can't stop someone from lying.
Yes, you can.
You can stop someone from lying.
It's right here, Salem.
Truth sprinkles.
Do they work?
All too well.
It's how the Witches' Council got me to confess my scheme for world domination.
Well, do you wanna help me bake, Your Highness?
Like I have a choice.
This looks easy.
"Preheat oven to 500 degrees".
I don't think so.
Check again.
"Preheat oven to 5,000"?
!
Aunt Zelda, can you help me?
I'm trying to make truth sprinkles.
Oh, you're using your magic.
Excellent.
Do you want to make them from scratch or use instant?
There's instant?
I'll use that.
Oh, witchcraft in an MTV world.
It's all quick cuts and funny angles.
Now, we keep our potions regarding openness and truth in a secret cabinet.
This is a very special moment.
The moment I get to see the secret cabinet?
Well, if you're gonna make fun, I won't show it to you.
Psst!
The cabinet's over here.
- Who said that?
- Me, Louisa.
Over here.
Wow, these walls can talk.
Sometimes they never shut up.
Don't start with me, cat.
I've seen what you do when they're out of the house.
Oh, for Pete's sake, the moment's ruined.
Oh, neat.
Hey, look at all these things.
Frog lips, freeZe-dried eye of newt.
Hey, are these the truth sprinkles?
No, those are ice-cream sprinkles.
They're in the wrong cabinet.
Hey, Hilda, have you seen the Jiffytruth?
Yeah, it's in my bag.
I used it last week when I took my car in for repairs.
Turns out I really did need new brake pads.
"Jiffytruth, 100 percent refined truth.
Trace amounts of harsh reality.
For best results, sprinkle on something sweet, as the truth can be bitter".
It is great stuff.
It makes you reveal your true feelings.
Which reminds me.
Zelda, the postman has a crush on you.
That is not what the sprinkles are for.
They should only be used in serious matters.
Well, this is serious.
You remember Libby?
Well, she's been spreading lies about me and Jenny and it's really upsetting Jenny.
Well, give Libby some sprinkles.
If those don't work, try some Lady Bald Spot.
You just spray it-- Hilda, that's enough.
Sabrina, you can take the sprinkles.
But let me warn you, the truth can have painful side effects.
- Like what?
- Itching, chafing, hurt feelings.
Sounds like gym class.
Harvey, you would not believe what I just heard.
Okay, I'll tell you.
That's not Sabrina's real nose.
- It's not?
- Don't you get it?
She had surgery.
Why?
What's wrong?
Never mind.
All right, everyone to your stations.
You know what today is, it's Bundkuchen Freitag.
It's Bundt Friday.
Get your pans.
Now, did you know that Richard Nixon's favourite snack food was the bundt?
Oh, he'd eat it secretly and then deny it.
But if you listen closely to those tapes--  Smell your bundts.
Smell your neighbour's bundts.
Mm.
We got really lucky.
Our Dutch chocolate looks much better than Libby's 14 grain.
You know, I think maybe I'll offer her a piece of our cake.
- Why?
- Just to show she can't get to us.
You're a much nicer person than I am.
- Hi, Libby.
- Sabrina.
Do you want to try a piece of our cake?
Like I'd taste anything you gave me.
What's in it, poison?
No, just chocolate.
Lots of chocolate.
- Really?
- And sprinkles.
Oh, all right.
But I'm not going to start being nice to you.
That's okay.
I just wanted to ask you one question.
What have you been saying about Jenny and me behind our backs?
Like, I'd tell you.
Okay, here's what I was saying.
I was saying that her father's in jail and that she cheats on tests.
And then I threw in that you had a nose job.
But those are all lies.
- You don't have to tell me.
- What's going on?
I was telling Sabrina all the rumours we've been spreading about her.
- Why?
She's not in the loop.
- So?
And by the way, it was Jill who made up the nose-job story.
Which is actually very funny because she's the one who: - You swore you'd never tell.
- And Cee Cee?
She kisses her Pete Sampras poster every night.
- That was super top-secret.
- You're a snitch.
I'm gonna tell everybody about your mom.
Yo, I have a feeling Libby won't be spreading any more lies.
Are you serious?
How did you do that?
Piece of cake.
Hey, did you see a container of sprinkles on the counter?
Yeah, Mrs. BoZigian took them.
She got really excited and started putting them on all the bundts, then left the room.
Gotta go.
Mrs. BoZigian?
- Mrs. BoZigian?
- Oh, my goodness, offering free food to teachers?
I'm lucky I didn't lose a hand.
You took our cake to the faculty lounge?
Yes, and the sprinkles were a delightful touch.
- Oh, no.
- Is there a problem?
I think I'll skip class.
The truth is, I don't want to be here any more than the kids do.
And I can still make the fifth race.
No, it's fine.
And who knows?
It might make the world a better place.
That's the spirit of bundt.
And you say you're a siZe 3 when you're really a siZe 5.
Yeah, well, remember when I swore I didn't kiss Danny?
I did.
A lot.
Hi, Harvey.
How's your cake?
Good.
And you know, I didn't just take Home Ec because coach told me to.
I like to cook.
I like it a lot.
Hey.
- Hey, I saved us a piece.
- Hi.
With sprinkles.
- Well, you go first.
- Okay.
Wow, it's good.
You know what it tastes like?
It tastes like I lied to you yesterday.
You lied to me?
About what?
The truth is, I'd rather go to the Slicery alone with Harvey tonight.
Just the two of you?
I think Harvey and I might be soul mates.
And you said you only liked him as a friend, so you don't mind, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
Perfect.
I'll go tell Harvey you're not coming.
Sabrina, you didn't get any cake.
No, you know, I'm really not very hungry.
Freak.
- Mutant.
Shovelhead.
Let me give you the truth, Ricky.
You kids come here, talk about your futures, your dreams.
But what about me?
You think I wanted to be a guidance counsellor?
Heck, no.
I was born to play the blues.
I got no future And neither do you Your SAT scores are 432 Welcome to Loserville GUY 1: Come on, how far did she let you go?
GUY 2: How far?
I didn't even try to kiss her.
- You didn't?
- No, I'm not ready.
Didn't I tell you I'm a virgin?
- Really?
Me too.
- Excellent.
I feel really awkward right now.
Attention, students.
LARUE : This is Principal Larue.
I wanted to announce that as soon as I finish this yummy bundt cake I'm going to the movies, like I do every Friday afternoon.
And I'm paying for my popcorn with petty cash.
Thank you.
Sabrina.
Jenny said you weren't coming tonight.
Is it something to do with your nose?
No.
I just can't make it.
You and Jenny have a good time.
I'm late for the bus.
Hey, you run funny.
Stop whatever you're doing.
This is more important.
I was on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough.
Nobody cares.
Which look do you think Drell will like better: Tough chick or damsel in distress?
Tough chick or damsel in distress?
Isn't there something in the middle?
Like a tough chick in distress?
- Ooh, I like it.
- I hate it.
Why don't you just wear what you wore last time Drell stood you up?
He is not going to stand me up.
Were you cooking something, Zelda?
No, Drell did it again.
He sent you a half a pot roast?
That just means he's gonna be a little late.
Oh, he's so thoughtful.
- Hey.
- Oh, no.
You look unhappy.
Tell Zelda.
I can't let you bring me down.
I've got a date.
What's wrong?
Well, you were right.
High school is no place for the truth.
People were blurting out their feelings all over the place.
It was awful.
Well, I warned you.
The truth can be unruly.
But don't worry.
The sprinkles wear off after 24 hours.
Twenty-four hours is too late.
Ignorance was bliss.
I was just too stupid to know it.
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hey, you made it.
Yeah, I made it.
- What now?
- You wanna order piZZa?
Great idea.
So this is nice, just the two of us.
Yeah.
No Sabrina.
It's great.
It is?
Sure, now, we can order onions.
Sabrina hates onions.
But won't it also give us a chance to get to know each other better?
Yeah.
Or we could just play foosball.
I'm not really into sports.
I'd rather talk about poetry and nature.
I'm really not into poetry.
But nature's okay.
I mean, I like going outside.
Me too.
But not when it's cold.
I don't like being cold.
- You see, I'm okay with cold.
- Do you like hot?
- Not that much.
- Oh.
Where is that piZZa?
We haven't ordered it yet.
- Sabrina, may I come in?
Yes.
I'm practising my magic.
Oh, wonderful.
I think I'm getting pretty good.
- Oh, no.
- And watch.
Ta-da.
I think I'm ready for a cruise ship.
Sabrina, it's Friday night.
Why aren't you out with your friends?
- Because.
- You want to talk about it?
- No.
- Are you sure?
Come on.
I think you need a snack.
- I'm really not hungry.
- Eat this.
The sprinkles will help you uncover your true feelings.
No, thanks.
I'd rather use Lady Bald Spot.
Trust me.
So why are you home?
Because Jenny told me she wanted to be alone with Harvey tonight and I said it was okay.
And is it okay?
Yeah, I guess.
No.
No, it's not okay.
Harvey and Jenny are alone.
It should be Harvey and me or Jenny and me.
But it shouldn't be Harvey and Jenny alone without me.
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna tell Jenny just what I told you.
If I can remember it.
- Thanks, Aunt Zelda.
- You're welcome, dear.
Oh, and by the way, that dress is really ugly.
Slice Number 7.
This one's for the team.
Look, I made a swan.
Thanks.
I've come to speak the truth.
- Sabrina.
- You made it.
Jenny, we need to talk.
Right away.
You should know we ordered onions.
What is it, Sabrina?
I lied to you when I said I didn't mind you and Harvey coming here alone.
I do mind.
And I know you guys might be soul mates, but-- - We're not soul mates.
- You're not?
No.
Harvey's really cute and he's really nice, but you can't build a life on that.
I'd be willing to give it a shot.
- Are you guys talking about me?
- Yes.
Come talk about me over here.
I was just telling Sabrina what a crummy time we had without her.
Yeah.
She can't even play foosball.
You know, Harvey, I think I liked you better when you were distant and mysterious.
Up close, you're kind of a loud chewer.
Well, sometimes, I put little pieces of paper in your hair and you don't even notice.
Isn't this great?
Us being honest with each other and all.
Do you love my hair?
I see you went with the little black feathered thing.
Yes.
And now I'm off to the linen closet where I will travel to another dimension of time and space to have a lovely date with Drell.
- Don't wait up.
- Stop.
I have something to say.
I know I said that Drell would stand you up and this date would never happen.
And I was wrong.
I love it when you say that.
- Will you say it again?
- No.
Look, just have fun on your date.
After all you've been through with Drell, you deserve a good time.
Thanks.
Bye.
Gotta go.
I don't want to keep Drell waiting.
Although it is kind of a funny image, Drell waiting.
I just had the best idea.
- I'm not going.
- What?
I'm standing Drell up.
I'm gonna give him a taste of his own pot roast.
Oh, Hilda.
That's perfect.
Those self-help books are really paying off.
I know.
Now lock me in my bedroom before I change my mind.
- Now it's two games apiece.
- Hey, Harvey, before we play again, can I tell you something?
Sure.
Tonight, we have no secrets from each other.
It's kind of personal, but I've been wanting to tell you this for the longest time.
I think you have the world's most perfect sideburns.
Really?
- Yeah, and one more thing.
- Yeah?
Onions give you really bad breath.
I wish my fur had an elastic waistband.
Well, stop eating.
I can't.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, hi, hi.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
You were right, the truth sprinkles set me free.
Well, I'm glad, but they weren't truth sprinkles.
Surprise.
I gave you ice-cream sprinkles.
- You lied to me?
- No, I-- Okay, I did.
But the point is, I wanted you to learn that the truth is something you should find without magic.
I can't believe you did that.
I told Harvey he had the world's most perfect sideburns and I didn't have to?
I am so embarrassed.
Oh, Sabrina.
You should never be embarrassed by the truth.
Oh, yeah?
Then why did you change out of your dress?
Hey, you guys wanna have lunch today?
As long as Sabrina comes along.
- Sure.
- Cool.
- Cool.
- Cool.
Hi, Libby.
So where are Jill and Cee Cee?
Like I care.
We're no longer friends.
Hi, Libby.
Nice outfit.
Oh, and I love those pants.
What are they, a SiZe 3?
You know it.
So where have you two been?
LARUE : Attention, students.
This is the real Principal Larue.
Last Friday some prankster broke into my office and impersonated me.
I, of course, was at the district office all day working to make your school a better place.
Thank you.
You think they bought that, huh?
Oh, no.
I'll miss you, Trisha.
See you soon, Samantha.
Take care, Brian.
Goodbye, Bernadette.
AdiÃ³s, Coleen.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I need a piece of sky, with a smidge of smoke, and a slightly bulbous doohickey.
Here you go.
You know, it's funny.
But when you live a thousand years, jigsaw puZZles don't seem like such a waste of time.
Hey, I'm home.
Wow.
You guys haven't moved since I left this morning.
- Hi, Sabrina.
How was school?
- Great.
Libby dropped her tray at lunch for the third day in a row.
I'm getting really good at that.
Yes!
Now you can read "Hindenburg".
There's nothing in the freeZer.
We're all out of ice cream.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I know.
I'm not supposed to eat sweets before dinner.
No.
We're witches.
Dig in.
- Cool.
You want some?
- Of course.
And you shouldn't eat sweets before dinner.
I've got to get better at this magic.
Rollerblades.
Why can't I find a spell for Rollerblades?
Salem, help me.
It's like you don't care.
Oh, I care.
I care deeply about your-- What was it?
Rollerblades.
Did you check under sporting goods?
"Sporting events.
To win, lose, or tie".
That's all you have to do to influence the game?
Easy.
Don't mess around with that, unless you give me time to call my bookie.
Here we go.
"Sporting goods".
They have in-line skates.
Okay, I need an old shoebox.
"A gift from a quick-footed animal".
Ow!
That wasn't a gift.
Okay, here goes.
Come on, Rollerblades.
Yes.
It worked.
I made "Rollerblahs"?
Sabrina, you want breakfast?
- No, thanks.
I'll be out "Rollerblahing".
- What's wrong?
She wanted in-line skates, but she wanted a brand name.
Oh, you can't do that.
We have strict copyright laws ever since the '70s when witches way overdid the Gucci.
You can still get decent knockoffs from the Hong Kong witches.
I don't care about labels.
"Rollerblahs" aren't the same.
I mean, even the kid on the box isn't having any fun.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
You'll buy me Rollerblades?
No.
You'll get a job like the rest of us.
"Babysitter needed.
Triplets".
It's been up there for years.
Oh here's one.
"Earn money watching TV".
Hey, that was mine.
You've got to be more aggressive in this job market.
Oh, here's another babysitting job, and just one kid.
And I'm very responsible, and I love children.
I even was one.
- Tonight, can you start tonight?
- Tonight?
I guess I could.
Not so fast.
You're gonna fall down, honey.
No, this is great.
I really appreciate this.
My husband and I never get out.
Oh, I really should get to class.
Wait.
Don't go, please?
I need adult conversation.
What's happening in the world?
Look, I'll see you tonight, and in the meantime, you can watch MTV news.
Now, cells reproduce by mitosis.
Thank you for joining us, Miss Spellman.
I was just about to tell the class what mitosis is.
Do you know?
It's a science thing?
Listen closely.
You just might learn something.
Mitosis is a process in which And there you have it in a Zygote.
All right, since we covered so much material today, I'm gonna move the test up to tomorrow.
Have fun studying.
But Mr. Pool, tonight's game four of the World Series.
No, really?
Well, since I'll be stuck here hosting parents' night, I guess we'll all be missing the series together.
Vindictive?
Perhaps.
But it's what gets me through the day.
Hey, Sabrina.
My hand kind of cramped up after "mitosis is," so I was wondering if maybe we could get together and study tonight?
You and me?
That's what we means.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, wait, I can't.
I'm babysitting tonight.
But I bet you could come over.
They're desperate.
- So cool?
- Yeah, cool.
Cool.
Hilda, hurry up, we've got to go.
I still don't understand why I can't go to parents' night with you.
Because, Salem, it's weird enough that we're two sisters who live together in an old Victorian house.
If we show up with a cat, we cross the line into Looneyville.
Zelda, feel my head.
I think I have a fever.
I can't go to school.
It's just parents' night.
But I hate school.
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Oh, grow up.
And don't try making it snow.
Hey, it just started snowing, and it's really coming down.
Hilda.
Okay, okay.
It's stopped.
There.
No one was hurt.
- Well, I'm off to my job.
- You're all dressed up.
Yeah, well, I wanted to make a good impression on the baby.
And Harvey's gonna be there.
Oh.
- Don't "oh".
We have a study date.
Uh-huh.
- Don't "uh-huh".
We have a test.
Uh-huh.
- Don't you start.
Look, it's no big deal.
I mean, Harvey could have asked anyone to study with him.
Of course, he did ask me.
Gotta go.
- His "babas" are in the fridge.
- Fridge, "baba".
Got it.
And I'm so sorry there's not much food for you and your friend Harvey to snack on.
I'll be able to whip something up.
Let's go.
Now, if he gets fussy or anything, just try reading him "Goodnight Moon".
And also, you'll always get a big smile out of him, if you call him Rudy KaZootie, or more formally, Mr. KaZootie.
- Honey.
- Okay, there's his baby monitor.
And here are his cookies.
See why we have to get out?
We won't be late.
And you call if you need anything.
I guess you'll need this.
So, Mr. KaZootie, what should we play first?
CraZy Eights?
- Hi, you found it.
- Yep.
Should have said it was the house with the flying duck on the mailbox.
You really notice mailboxes, don't you?
Yeah.
So how's the babysitting?
Excellent.
The baby's asleep, so it's just the two of us.
Not that I planned it, it's just, you know, the baby was really tired, so-- Hey, look, they've got a TV.
Yeah, I bet the World Series would look great on that.
But I came here to study.
Right.
So let's study.
Except my notes aren't very good.
Oh, we can work off of my notes.
Okay.
Mitosis is-- Mitosis is-- You know, studying makes me hungry.
Yeah, me too.
I'll go see what I can dig up.
I found all kinds of great stuff.
It's not brand name, but I'm sure it tastes fine.
"Shmickers"?
"N&N's"?
"Butterthumb"?
Where do these people shop?
I don't know.
But if you're thirsty, there's "Popsi".
- Do they have Yoo-hoo?
- No, but they have "Hey, Over Here".
I think I'll just have a diet "Popsi".
- So should we get back to studying?
- Yeah.
Mitosis is--  Baby needs me.
Be right back.
Rudy, it's okay.
Look, your favourite book, "Goodnight Moon".
"Hello, moon.
Goodnight, moon".
That was a good book, huh?
Come on, Rudy, be a pal.
Harvey and I have a study date.
Don't "oh" or "uh-huh".
Though, I do sort of think he's cute and-- I don't know why I'm telling you, but enjoy your book.
MAN : And another quiet inning comes to an end.
The baby's fine.
I was just checking the score.
You're really into baseball, huh?
Yeah, but sports aren't my only interest.
I don't tell a lot of people this, but someday, I wanna be a dentist.
A dentist?
That's great.
Who doesn't love the dentist?
And I've noticed you have really good teeth.
- I do?
- Yeah.
But that's not a professional opinion.
It's just me.
Excuse me.
I've gotta go to work.
MAN : And welcome back to the World Series.
Oh, it's okay, Mr. KaZootie.
Come here.
Don't be sad.
Come here.
Big boys don't cry.
Come on, be a big boy.
Be a big boy.
Be a big boy.
That's better.
We go to the bottom of the 9th, and a yawner.
Somebody do something.
Well, the baby's got his bottle now.
Shall we get back to "mitosis is"?
Yeah, right.
I mean, the test is tomorrow.
I really gotta focus.
Mitosis is--  - What was that?
- Better go check the baby.
I'm coming, Rudy.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Rudy, is that you?
Ba-ba.
Mr. KaZootie.
What have I done?
Oh, I am in so much trouble.
- I broke the baby.
- Ba-ba.
We have to undo this.
Okay.
- Pesto change-o, go back to normal - Ba-ba.
- Go back to normal - Ba-ba.
Oh, that's not even close.
Here's your "baba".
Oh, this is so creepy.
We've gotta get help.
- "Bankie".
- Keep "bankie" until you're dressed.
- Hey, Sabrina, you need some help?
- No, everything is fine.
Why don't you watch the game?
It's one strike from the end, unless this guy knocks one out, it's over.
Hey, look.
MAN : It's a home run.
Unbelievable.
Folks, we're going into extra innings.
- You could help a little.
Ow!
- Nose.
That's not helping.
Okay, there.
Now, just don't spit up on your dad's suit jacket, okay?
Go.
- Up.
Up.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
I gotta get the phone.
Did she answer yet?
Am I talking?
Oh, hi, Sabrina.
Yeah, it's Jerry, Rudy's dad.
Is he okay?
Ask her if he's okay.
I know what to ask.
Is he okay?
Yeah.
Rudy's having a real good time.
He's riding his banana right now.
How's your dinner?
- They were a little late in seating us.
- Really?
But since we got a table, they've been rushing the heck out of us.
Oh, don't let them.
You're there to relax.
Take all the time you want.
Well, that's very sweet of you, Sabrina.
Well, we were just checking in, so we'll see you soon.
Hm?
Okay, not too soon.
Right.
Bye.
See, everything's fine.
I'm sorry.
It's just been such a weird day.
I mean, you almost went off the road in that freak snowstorm.
And now I just have the funniest feeling.
Stop with the feelings.
Harvey, I'm going to walk the baby.
You stay here and watch the game, okay?
Okay.
But it's almost over.
Only a grand slam will tie it.
--deep right field.
He got a hold of that one.
It's up.
It's hanging there.
It could be.
It might be.
It's a grand slam.
All right.
There's magic in the air.
Welcome, parents.
I'm Mr. Pool.
You may look at me, a man in his prime, and wonder: "Why is he teaching high school biology"?
Well, it's because I believe that science is the foundation upon which we build our future.
That and I tanked my MCATs.
Mr. Pool is cute.
You have got to get out more.
- I wonder if he's single.
- Excuse me.
Is there something you would like to share with the class?
I need to go to the nurse.
Is there a problem, Mrs. Spellman?
- Yes, my tummy-- - No, she's fine.
And it's Miss Spellman.
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm also Miss Spellman.
We're Sabrina's aunts.
Sisters.
Not an alternative couple.
- So you're single?
- Yes.
- And you?
- Extremely.
Now I really am gonna throw up.
La-la-la-la.
Okay, just sit here.
Here.
You can read your book.
Or just chew on it.
Yes.
Yes!
- Salem, what are you doing?
Uh-- Nothing.
- It looks like you're playing with yarn.
I have urges, Sabrina.
Look, can we deal with your issues later?
- I've got a bigger problem.
My yarn.
Okay, now, what do I do about this?
Dear Lord, you picked up a guy at the bus station.
No.
It's the baby I'm babysitting for.
He's 14 months old.
Something happened to him.
Do I smell teen witchery?
- Salem, you've gotta help me.
Change him back before his parents get home and prosecute.
What do you want me to do?
I'm a cat.
Go talk to your aunts.
They're at my school.
I can't bring him there.
- Can you watch him?
I suppose.
Thanks.
I owe you one.
Horsey.
Ride horsey.
Get him off of me.
Get him off of me!
What an amusing Erlenmeyer flask story, Mr. Pool.
Really?
I've told it a thousand times.
No one's ever gotten it.
Fools.
You know, we should exchange e-mail.
What's your address?
Me?
I'm on Quick Net.
My screen name is Biostud.
You're Biostud?
I'm Chemkitten.
Oh, didn't we meet in a chat room and discuss polyvinyl chloride?
Yes.
And you are very naughty.
Well L-O-S-E-R.
Loser.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Sabrina?
- What are you doing at parents' night?
- Nothing.
Oh, I see you brought your father.
- Moon.
- Don't play with that.
Dad.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Spellman.
Mr. Spellman?
Actually, he likes to be called Mr. KaZootie.
Mr. KaZootie?
- That's our real name.
It's Scottish.
- I'm Scottish too.
And I know not of the clan KaZootie.
Be you a highlander?
Oh, we're lowlanders.
Yeah.
Is your dad okay, Sabrina?
Darn.
I gotta go work the bake sale.
It's a prestige thing.
You do it all, don't you?
Bye-bye.
- Yeah, bye-bye.
Oh, yes, bye-bye to all of you.
I thought you were supposed to be babysitting.
I am.
That's him.
That's the little baby?
- Funny clown.
- Watch it.
Look, I'm desperate.
You guys have to help me, okay?
Rudy's parents are gonna be back really soon, and they might notice they missed a big moment in their son's life.
Well, obviously, you've cast some kind of spell, so all you have to do is reverse it.
Well, I didn't mean to cast a spell.
This magic ruins everything.
He's supposed to be in his crib, and I'm supposed to be with Harvey.
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.
Stop that.
This is serious.
Oh, calm down, Sabrina.
Just try to figure out exactly what you did.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Rudy was crying.
I picked him up.
I said big boys don't cry and I rubbed his back.
- Did you say anything else?
- I don't think so.
Be a big boy.
He's right.
I said be a big boy.
- And I bet you said it three times.
- Ah!
Mystery solved.
- You cast a passion spell.
- Passion spell?
What's that?
If you want something enough, and say it three times, it might just happen.
- We like to call it a Travis.
- Why?
Randy Travis, Randy Travis, Randy Travis I love this spell.
What am I doing here?
Oh, we were just illustrating a point for our niece.
I hope we haven't caught you at a bad time.
No, it's fine.
My wife does wonder where I keep popping off to though.
- Will there be anything else?
- Maybe later.
If you need me, you'll know where to find me.
You always do.
Now, he is so cute.
I love his new album.
Can we get back to me?
What do I do to fix this?
Exactly what you did before, three times, but in reverse.
This is really weird.
Boy big a be, Boy big a be, boy big a be It tickles.
Nothing happened.
It didn't work.
It just takes time.
Well, his parents are gonna be home soon.
Better hope they have a sense of humour.
Maybe I can blame it on a radioactive spider.
Let's go, Rudy.
Rudy.
Where's the baby?
La-la-la-la.
- It's on the house, Mr. Travis.
- Well, thank you.
Does it have nuts?
Yes, but you can pick them out.
La-la-la-la-la.
Cookies!
- Hey, hey, hey, you can't do that.
- Mine.
Mr. KaZootie!
You can see why I changed my name.
MAN : It's the bottom of the 15th.
Put on a pot of java, we could be here all night.
That's what so great about baseball.
- Sabrina, is that you?
- Yeah.
You are missing a freaky game.
It moved like it had a string attached to it.
You've had a big night.
Now, let's go over what I taught you.
Rudy, how did you get this way?
Good.
Okay, now it's sleepy time.
Read me, "Moon".
I'm too tired.
Play with your toes.
Night.
I could sure use a "Popsi".
Is the game still on?
Yeah.
Man, it could go on forever.
Come on.
And it's an unassisted triple play.
It's over.
Wow.
See, now, that's what's so great about baseball.
Anything can happen.
Yeah, yeah.
You never know.
We really should study now.
Okay.
- Mitosis is-- - Can we take a break?
I'm wiped.
This babysitting is a lot harder than I thought.
Sure.
I mean, we could just sit here and talk.
- I'd like that.
- This is kind of nice.
Yeah.
So.
So.
We're home.
Mitosis is-- I didn't expect you so soon.
We skipped dessert.
I missed my baby so much.
How much do we owe you, $4 an hour?
Actually it's 5, but 4 would be fine.
Jerry, you've gotta come see this.
Thanks.
Gotta go.
Look at our sweet little angel.
They grow so quickly, don't they?
Oh, yeah.
Do you ever think about having another one-- No.
We should go now.
I'm looking for a slanted green piece with a funny little waddle.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You know, you really have a flare for jigsaw puZZles, Randy.
I spend a lot of time on a bus.
This is kind of nice, though.
Popcorn, puZZle, lightly falling snow.
It's real nice.
Can I go yet?
- No.
- No.
Okay.
Looking for a sky blue rhombus with a little puff of clouds.
Oh, there it is.
Mitosis is-- Salem, I can't concentrate.
You wanna play Risk?
- I'm sick of Risk.
Hey, I've got a great idea.
- Salem, I think I hear the can opener.
- Really?
Please be tuna.
Please be tuna.
Eddie Cibrian, Eddie Cibrian, Eddie Cibrian Uh-- What am I doing here?
I was about to pull Hasselhoff out of a burning corvette.
Oh, well, you can do that later.
I was just kind of wondering if you would turn around for me.
Sure.
Thanks.
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
Unless you're into jigsaw puZZles.
My aunts are working on one downstairs with Randy Travis.
Hm.
Sounds like fun.
Well, guess Hasselhoff will have to wait.
Wow, this magic thing isn't so bad.
Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt You have the test.
You may commence failing.
Mitosis is-- Mitosis is-- Great game, huh, Harvey?
Yeah, wasn't it freaky?
Freaky?
You want freaky?
Randy Travis came to parents' night.
Have you met Sabrina's father?
He's pretty freaky too.
Get back to your test there.
Mitosis is-- Mitosis is--
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
That cover model, she's so I wish I could look like that.
I wish  Much better.
Hey.
Heh.
Love the look.
Ha, ha.
I'm ready to clean my closet.
Where are you?
You didn't see me.
I was never here.
Sabrina, have you seen Salem?
- Um, no.
You are the worst liar.
Come on.
No.
I won't go.
I won't go.
I won't go.
Oh, is it time for Salem to be wormed again?
No, worse.
I have to do community service.
It's part of his punishment for attempting global conquest.
As if being a cat for a hundred years wasn't enough, Zelda had to put me in a pets for prisoners programme.
I gave you a choice.
You could have done highway cleanup.
Yeah, cats do real well on highways.
Stop complaining and get your wormy little butt downstairs in two minutes.
It's time to pay your debt to society.
Can't I just write a cheque?
I don't know what your problem is.
It's nice to help people.
And what nice things have you done lately?
Me?
I do nice things all the time.
Really?
Since you got your magical powers, all I've seen you do is change your clothes and make Brussels sprouts disappear.
That's not true, and I'll prove it.
I'll use my magic to do three nice things before the end of school today.
- Easy.
- Not so easy.
Before you shoot your finger off, you'd better consider the consequences, or terrible things could happen.
Hi.
My name's Jenny, I'm running for sophomore class president, and I'm with the Outsider Party.
Hi.
My name is Libby, and I'm also running for class president, but I'm with the Popular Party.
A vote for me is a vote for smaller classes and more funding for the arts.
A vote for me is a vote for more piZZa at lunch.
I'm voting for her.
She's pretty much killing you with that piZZa platform.
I don't get it.
Why doesn't anybody wanna support the Outsider Party?
Maybe because you named it after their biggest fear?
Libby thinks being class president is about lunch food and dances.
Call me idealistic, but I really wanna make this school a better place.
Hey, you got my vote.
Which gives me a grand total of two.
Poor Jenny.
There's nothing like losing to say you're a loser.
I wish I could win.
I really wanted to make a difference.
That's one nice thing.
Hey, Harvey.
- Whoa, what's that smell?
- Protein shake.
Coach says I need to bulk up if I ever wanna start at running back.
Well, you look fatter.
Heh.
That's sweet of you.
But you see that guy over there?
That's Randy the Destroyer.
Unless I put on 20 pounds or he gets injured, I stay on the bench.
Man, I wanna play.
- You wanna go in?
- Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.
Hey, watch it.
Ow!
My hand.
That's two.
Sorry I'm late, but my car broke down.
I made the mistake of trying to go uphill in my AMC Gremlin.
Why don't you just get a better car, Mr. Pool?
Like a Ferrari?
Sure.
You know what?
I'm gonna run right out after class and buy one.
And I'll pay for it with frustration.
Now, can we move on to science?
All right, today we're gonna talk about the elements and why one can't turn lead into gold no matter how hard one tries.
--and radon, which is the heaviest of the noble gases.
Don't laugh.
All right, uh, read Chapter 4 tonight.
And take showers.
Especially you.
Mr. Pool, are you okay?
You know, you seem especially bitter today.
Me?
I'm fine.
What a mess.
- It's just a bunch of papers.
- No, my life.
I've been a teacher seven years, and I still can't afford a new briefcase.
I found this one.
I was wondering who T.G.K. was.
Just to pay my bills, I have to work cafeteria duty, I have to supervise the Science Club, and on weekends, I wash Principal Larue's car.
Well, maybe you should consider doing something else.
Like what?
I love teaching science.
It's the only good thing in my life.
Well, you have a lot of coupons.
Thanks.
Oh, this one for 40 cents off Fruitkooks has expired.
No.
Ugh!
Ah, who are they fooling anyway?
You can no more sweeten a cookie with fruit than you can turn lead into gold.
Or can you?
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Lead is Pb, mercury with-- Thanks for, uh, helping me pick up my stuff, Sabrina.
Heh.
Now, get out.
I'm on to something.
Yes.
Yes.
This would turn lead into gold.
That's alchemy, and it defies the laws of physics.
Oh, who cares?
I'm gonna be rich.
Whoo!
That's three nice things.
That was very good, Jeffrey, but your E string needs tuning.
I'll be right back.
This one's for MoZart.
Hey, guys.
- Oh, I see Jeffrey's here.
- Yep.
MoZart started spinning in his grave about ten minutes ago.
Oh, please, let the poor man rest in peace.
I don't get it.
Why don't you use your magic to make Jeffrey play better?
I mean, wouldn't that be a nice thing for him and for us?
Yes, but I would never do that.
That's right.
You must be careful about meddling in mortals' lives.
We witches have rules.
Who cares about the rules?
I just want Jeffrey to keep paying for lessons.
- Well, I'd better get back.
- Must you?
Perfect.
Like it matters.
Aunt Zelda, I'm still a little confused about this meddling thing.
Why is it you can't use magic to make someone's life better?
Well, because it's impossible to know what would make a mortal happy.
What if you knew exactly what would make them happy?
Well, you still can't predict the consequences.
But wouldn't those consequences just be good?
Well, in some cases the consequences might be good, but then again, terrible things could happen.
Hey, any word on the election?
Not officially, but this came out.
How can they print that Libby's won when the results haven't been announced?
It's a weekly, Sabrina.
They usually just go on a hunch.
Yeah, well, I have a hunch too.
Attention, students, this is Principal Larue, and I have in my hands the results of a grand experiment called democracy.
- Just say it.
- The president of the freshman class, the winner is Andy Gallop.
The president of the sophomore class, the winner is - Libby Chessler.
- Jennifer Kelley.
The president of the junior class, the winner is - Can you believe I won?
- Yes, I can.
Hey, Jenny, how about a picture for the yearbook?
Hey, congratulations, Jenny.
I'm really glad you won.
It's because people like you voted for me and not piZZa.
Uh, right.
Hey, I'm having a really great day too.
Coach just told me I'm starting at running back tomorrow.
- Wow.
- That's what you wanted, right?
Absolutely.
You guys gonna come watch me play?
- Sure.
Cool.
- Cool.
Cool.
And don't be late because, you know, I'm starting.
Libby, I just wanted to say that I think you handled your defeat very gracefully.
Oh, bite me.
Sorry I'm late, but I was, uh, out buying a new car.
A Ferrari, since you asked.
Yes, thanks to the miracle of science and an educated brain, I now have one wicked set of wheels.
Okay, whoever can explain the Krebs cycle gets a lump of gold.
Isn't learning fun?
Salem, you're back.
- How was jail?
- Not bad.
There's a guy in solitary convinced Alan DershowitZ appeared to him as a talking cat.
I told him I'd call the governor and plead his innocence.
See, I told you it was nice to help people.
Are you kidding?
I'm not calling.
Calling who?
About what?
- Are we getting piZZa?
- No.
I was just gonna tell Salem all about the nice things I did today.
Yeah, but I'm not interested.
I'm interested.
Tell me.
Oh, but wait.
Okay, start.
See, I wanted to use my magic more to help my friends, so I made a few adjustments in their lives-- Hold on.
Didn't Zelda tell you there are rules against meddling and terrible things could happen?
Not again.
Look, everyone's happy, everything's working out great, okay?
There's nothing terrible about it.
This is terrible piZZa.
And a fair catch is called by the Fighting Scallions.
Wow, great view.
This is cool, hanging out in the president's section, watching Harvey start.
Oh, look, there's Mr. Pool.
Wow, who's the blond?
I think she came with the Ferrari.
Oh, no, wait.
She's with the guy next to him.
The Fighting Scallions break from the huddle, and Harvey Kinkle is the lone, set back.
There's Harvey.
Wow, that's so great that he's out there.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, are you sure that's Harvey?
He looks kind of small.
It's first and ten from the 21, and the Scallions keep it on the ground.
- Kroeger hands off to Kinkle.
- Harvey's got the ball.
And he is pummelled.
Oh, the humanity.
That guy had no business being out there.
Oh, this is a terrible thing.
Oh, you poor thing.
It even hurts to chew.
No, it's just hot.
I feel so bad about Harvey.
I can't believe he sprained his arm.
I can't believe that's all he sprained.
Can we change the subject?
Let's talk about you being president.
All right.
I have my big meeting with Principal Larue this afternoon.
Hey, Jenny, tell Larue to do something about this meat loaf, huh?
Meat loaf?
Hey, man, what about intellectual freedom?
I'd better go.
I'll see you later at the Slicery.
- Yeah, we'll get piZZa.
- Great.
This meat loaf really gags.
Hey, Mr. Pool.
Smells good.
Linguini with white truffles.
No more artery-clogging sloppy joes for me.
Now that I'm rich, I have a reason to live.
- So are you happy?
- Oh, I'll say.
Wealth gives me the freedom to teach science without anger and resentment.
I can now teach for the pure joy of teaching.
Ah, ah, ah.
Leave the whole block.
Hey, Harvey.
Hi, Libby.
So did you make it to the game on Saturday?
Yeah, I saw you start and finish.
My dad's got it all on video.
He keeps playing it over and over, saying that I can learn from it.
Well, you know, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
I'm a cheerleader.
Let me handle this.
Sure.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm sorry.
You know, not like a responsible sorry, more like sympathetic sorry in a blameless, third party sort of way.
Feel better.
The principal will see you now.
Please, sit down.
The reason I called this meeting was to present my five-point programme, my contract with Westbridge, if I may.
Proceed.
Well, the first point focuses on class siZe-- You have no authority there.
- I don't?
- No.
Next point.
Well, I'm also concerned about arts funding-- You have no authority there.
- Textbooks?
- No.
- Curriculum?
- No.
- Parking?
- Ha.
I don't even have authority there.
These topics that you raise are not to be addressed in this room.
They are decided by powerful men in smoke-filled boardrooms hundreds of miles from here.
It is not your place to question their choices.
They know you, Jennifer.
Better than you know yourself.
Let's leave the business of school to the people whose business is school.
Student class elections have always been a popularity contest.
Let's keep it that way.
Hey, how'd it go?
I'm on my second pitcher of root beer.
Why, what's wrong?
- I wish I'd never become president.
- You said that's what you wanted.
I was so young, so naive.
I thought I could make a difference.
- But you can.
- No.
You keep your illusions, but it's too late for me.
I've seen how the meat loaf is made.
Oh, Jenny, I'm sorry.
It's a terrible thing.
- Hey.
- We need to talk.
Not now, I've had a really lousy day.
And apparently, it's not over yet.
This came in the toaster for you.
It's from Drell.
The head of the Witches' Council?
What does he want?
We don't know.
I wanted to open it, but Zelda wouldn't let me.
Report to my office immediately.
And bring your aunts with you.
I don't wanna go.
Drell scares me.
You guys go first and tell me what he wants.
Hey, I don't wanna see Drell any more than you do.
- Yeah, sure.
- Look, we used to be in love, but I no longer have any feelings for him.
How's my hair?
Come on, let's go.
Ow.
My foot.
I don't like this place.
It reminds me of the principal's office.
Drell will see you now.
You look so familiar.
Hello, Drell.
What a pleasant surprise.
No, it's not.
I summoned you, and you're here.
Hilda, what's with your hair?
My new boyfriend likes it this way.
Oh, your new boyfriend.
What's his name?
Um-- Well, I hope you and "Um" are very happy.
Sabrina, why don't we begin by you explaining to us why we're here.
- I don't know.
- Stop me if something sounds familiar.
"Athletic injury, fixed election, altered immutable laws of physics".
Oh, that.
- Sabrina?
- You didn't?
- I was just trying to help people.
- Help is a four-letter word.
Like "dumb" and "move," am I right?
Well, at first all the people I helped were happy, but now only one is.
And he's happy enough for all three of them, so-- Now, I should explain to you that when I say "am I right," it's a rhetorical question, because I'm always right.
Drell, please, Sabrina's a good kid.
And things are hard on her.
Her mother's in Peru, her father's in a book.
And I'm in the land of I don't care.
You're her guardians.
You should have warned her that if you meddle with people's lives, terrible things could happen.
- Oh, I did.
That's exactly what I said.
- So did I. So did Salem, but nobody made it sound like it was a big deal.
Oh, jeeZ.
Marge, get the guys down in Ominous Warnings to, uh, tweak up the reverb on the word terrible.
Terrible.
Terrible.
Terrible.
Oh, cool, that's nice.
That's nice.
Thank you, Marge.
Now, that was Marge's mistake.
And now, back to yours.
Now, the football injury and the class elections have no global consequences.
You can mess with your pimply pubescent peers all you want.
Alchemy, however, could collapse the world economy and wreak havoc on my T-bills.
Now, are you gonna fix this or should I give Salem a little blond kitty friend?
No, I can fix it.
I mean, I just have to erase the knowledge, right?
I don't have to destroy Mr. Pool.
You got a day.
That's 23 hours to solve the problem and one hour to shop for a scratching post.
You're done.
Go.
Get out of here.
No-- Uh-- Except you, Hilda.
Why don't you, uh, stay a moment?
That's it.
I am never going to help anyone ever again.
He's just trying to scare me, right?
Oh, look, Marge's teeth.
I've gotta go find Mr. Pool.
Let's go.
What was that all about?
Oh, he asked me out.
I turned him down.
Uh, Sabrina, now you only have Excuse me, is Mr. Pool in there?
You mean the guy who thinks he's too good to wash my car now?
No.
I haven't seen him.
Mr. Pool, there you are.
I am so happy to see you.
I'm happy to see you too, my little coupon picker-upper.
Come on.
Walk me to class.
Hey, look what I just got.
It's a digital personal assistant.
Watch this.
I just sent myself a fax.
Mr. Pool, I know you're really happy with your money, but, you know, easy come, easy go.
Oh, did I tell you?
I'm funding a grant.
It's called the Eugene Pool Award for Burnt-Out Teachers.
The healing begins now.
That's a beautiful dream.
Oh, man, I just wish everybody could be as happy as I am.
- Mr. Pool?
- Hm?
- Just enjoy the next 40 minutes.
- Of course.
It's time for science.
Aerobic respiration is correct.
Well done, Timmy.
Here you go.
And remember, everyone, you should learn for the sake of learning and not just for gold.
Well, that's my last lump for now.
I'll just make some more up tonight.
Heh.
Pool, you've got it wired up here.
No.
No.
It's gone.
I've lost it.
I never wrote it down.
Oh, this is a terrible thing.
Hi, Sabrina.
- You look bummed.
- Yeah, like everyone else.
I'm not bummed.
I made my peace with the universal meat-loaf.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Watch.
Could I have your attention?
I just wanted to say that I ran for president because I thought the job was about more than dances and lunch food.
I was wrong.
So I think you'll be better off with Libby.
I'm in control?
Yes.
Heh.
And I am one step closer to the White House.
Nice speech.
So you're happy?
Very.
I'd much rather be jaded than naive.
Who wouldn't?
Hey, Sabrina.
You know how you were feeling sorry for me yesterday?
You mean in that blameless, third party sort of way?
You should know that since I've been injured, I've been having a lot of fun.
I'm reading more.
I'm writing more.
I even think my grades are going to improve.
So this sitting around thing is really working for you.
Yeah, I'm super happy not playing football.
Just don't tell my dad.
A equals A. Of course A equals A. It's obvious.
It doesn't need to be stated.
- Mr. Pool?
- What?
Oh, it's you.
- Do you have a minute?
- Yes, a lifetime of them.
And now they're going by very slowly.
You know, I was just thinking that Jenny's happier not being class president and Harvey's happier not starting on the football team, and, well, it made me think that maybe you'll be happier not being rich.
Hm.
Happier not being rich?
Are you nuts?
Being rich is everything I ever dreamed of, and now it's gone.
It's all gone.
Not again.
Sabrina, could you help me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Pool.
I'm not supposed to help anyone.
But I guess one last time won't hurt.
Oh, why couldn't somebody just destroy me?
It can't be that bad.
And I have a feeling things will get better real soon.
And who knows, maybe you'll find a new briefcase.
Yeah, right.
- Steve.
Uh, sir.
- What is it, Pool?
Uh, I was wondering if, uh-- If I came by on Saturday, maybe I could wash your car.
So Mr. Rockefeller wants to wash my car.
Only problem is I found a 15-year-old who'll do it for 2 bucks cheaper.
I can beat that.
I'm having a back-in-the-same-old-rut special.
Well, I guess I'll see you Saturday.
Oh, great.
And, uh, by the way, that's a beautiful briefcase.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Core the pumpkin Ghosts come play Halloween, oh, happy day - Halloween, oh, happy day - Halloween, oh, happy day What are you doing to Salem?
I heard him screeching.
Very funny.
We were singing a Halloween carol.
Yes.
Happy Halloween.
I bet you couldn't sleep last night with all the excitement and anticipation.
I managed.
Oh, that's not the spirit.
Halloween is our favourite holiday.
It's a magical night.
Yes.
Sing it, Zeldie.
Have a jolly-olly Hallo-alloween Please stop singing.
Look, I'm trying, okay?
I'm going to school in a costume.
Guess who I am.
Sally Jessy Raphael.
What, do I need a microphone?
That is the lamest costume I've ever seen.
It's just a pair of glasses.
There's no fooling you.
Well, if you can do better, be my guest.
- There.
- Much better.
What did you do?
Oh, man.
Next up, we are going to talk to a teenage witch and her aunts who take things too far.
BOTH : Have a jolly-olly Hallo-alloween - Have a jolly-olly Hallo-alloween - Have a jolly-olly Hallo-alloween Does this make my butt look big?
Hey, Sabrina.
I got something for you.
It's kind of last minute, but here.
My parents are making me have a Halloween party.
Bummer.
Next thing you know they'll make you go on a ski trip.
No, see my dad always buys in bulk at these discount clubs, and we got a lot of snack food that expires in November.
Oh, so that's why it says "all food must be eaten by midnight".
I'm thinking about going as James Dean.
I love James Dean.
Yeah, and all I need's a white T-shirt, some jeans, and something to lean on.
Anyway, I was hoping you could come early and help me set stuff up.
I can't.
I've got a family thing.
My aunts take Halloween very seriously.
I know it's weird.
No, no, my mom's that way about Flag Day.
Well, I wish I could help.
I feel really bad.
I got your invitation, Harvey.
See you at 8.
Unless you need me to come early and help.
- Sure.
- No problem.
Hey, and now you don't have to feel bad.
- Please, I have to go to Harvey's party.
- No.
What if I promise to be with the family all Thanksgiving?
We're not big on Thanksgiving.
That holiday was started by Puritans, who weren't exactly witch-friendly.
So instead we celebrate a night devoted to little kids dressing up like superheroes?
That is not what All Hallows Eve is all about.
It's a time for remembering the dead.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
I just know I'll have a terrible time.
And that's what family gatherings are all about.
You think I wanna listen to cousin Marigold brag about how married she is and how single I am?
No.
But we go, because it's tradition.
And Zelda makes me.
And now you're making me?
See?
Tradition.
I tell you what.
If we get back in time, you can still go to Harvey's party, okay?
Not okay.
Libby's going early, so unless I'm there from the start, I may as well go to the Other Realm and never come back.
Can I go to Harvey's party?
It's so unfair.
They can't make me go to the Other Realm.
They made me a cat.
You're messing with the wrong crowd.
So there's no way I can go to Harvey's party?
There might be.
Get your magic book, turn to full body duplication.
What's that?
You can make a double that looks and acts just like you.
I'll send my double to the family thing.
No can do.
Your aunts would spot the switch in no time.
Well, then my double will hold my place until I can be with Harvey.
Okay, here goes.
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Bill Shakespeare stole that from us.
What a hack.
It didn't work.
Step aside.
Wow.
AmaZing.
It can't talk until you give it something to say.
And keep in mind, it can only say three sentences.
Let me think.
I want my double to be positive, because people always feel positive about positive people.
My tuna's coming up.
So let's start with "I'd love to".
I'd love to.
Okay, and I want me to be a good listener, so let's try "That is so true".
That is so true.
And we need a universal truth.
Oh, that's easy.
"Mr. Pool can be so annoying".
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.
Well, then I guess I'm-- We're all set.
Except I need a costume.
Hey, I look really cute.
That is so true.
I like me.
Okay, that's Libby.
She's really annoying.
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.
Now, your mission is to make sure she's never alone with Harvey.
Okay?
Go.
Sabrina?
You're not supposed to be here.
- You are totally butting in.
- That is so true.
Hey, Libby.
Hi, Sabrina.
You made it.
You know, you look good as a witch.
Harvey, did you notice I'm dressed as Jackie O?
Very classy.
- You guys wanna come in?
- I'd love to.
Sabrina and I will put out the sodas.
Jackie, you can fill a bathtub with CheeZ-Its.
Yes.
I'm in.
Come on, you three.
Even with instantaneous transport, we're going to be late.
Coming.
Coming.
Salem, you look adorable.
I feel like a Chippendales' cat.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You are not going dressed like that.
- Well, then I guess I'm not going.
- Sabrina, I know you have something more appropriate.
What about this?
Please, I only wore this dress to make Granny happy.
Now that she's passed away, I'm done with it.
Oh, come on.
It looks sweet on you.
That's what Granny used to say.
Let's get this show on the road.
You look nice, Hilda.
- Pass the potatoes.
Someone's in a hurry.
- Happy Halloween.
- Hold on.
What colour is my dress?
Pass the potatoes.
Hilda, you are in big trouble.
Stupid double.
Let's go.
Am I the only one looking forward to this?
Yes.
Are we there yet?
Wow.
No wonder my ears popped on the way up.
Oh, the Earth looks so full tonight.
- Zelda.
- Marigold.
And Hilda.
That outfit always looks so nice on you.
Thank-- Wait.
I see you brought your cat.
But no dates?
No, Marigold, we're still not married.
Don't, I'll cry.
Oh, and this must be Sabrina.
I heard you'd gone to live with your aunts.
- Is it okay?
- Yes, it's fine.
We love having her with us.
Well, a niece, it's almost like having a daughter.
My little girl, Amanda, is right here.
You get to sit with her.
Oh, goodie.
We can talk about dolls.
Zelda, Hilda, you'll sit with me.
- And, Salem, you'll be with the cat.
Swell.
You can all take your seats.
I'm going to check on the consommÃ©, or as Hilda would call it, soup.
What's wrong with soup?
Don't start.
Oh, look, Uncle Nuhney.
Here, Sabrina.
Uncle Nuhney?
Uncle Nuhney!
I can't believe I have to sit at the kiddie table.
I can't believe I have to sit at the kitty table.
Wait, give me a sec.
- M'Lady's here.
- Who's that?
Marigold's pet.
She thinks her litter box doesn't stink.
And what a lush.
M' Ooh, catnip.
Don't mind if I do.
Okay, here we go.
Hello, Salem.
Hello, M'Lady.
Hi, Amanda.
I'm your cousin Sabrina.
You better be nice to me or I'll put you in a jar.
Excuse me?
I put all the people who aren't nice to me in jars.
This is Mr. Altree.
He tried to teach me math.
Can he breathe in there?
Yes, I gave him air holes.
Here's a math problem, Mr. Altree.
Five air holes minus one air hole is how many?
No, please.
I wanna live.
I wanna live.
- See, nobody likes pop quiZZes.
I wanna live.
- Do you wanna put someone in a jar?
- No.
My aunts taught me it's not nice to use magic to hurt other people.
Well, my parents let me use magic any time I want, and I don't even have to ask.
- Brat.
- What was that?
Nothing.
Why do I have to sit by myself?
Can't I move over one seat?
No, I'm saving this for my husband.
Poor Harold's been working so much these days, I'm not sure he'll make it, but someone's got to bring home the prosciutto.
What's wrong with bacon?
- Aunt Zelda, can we go yet?
- Sabrina, we just got here.
Don't you walk away from me.
I wanna braid your hair.
Did anyone eat anything?
Deenie took a handful of pretZels.
Great.
I'd better refill.
Isn't the music kind of loud, Harvey?
I don't know.
The neighbours haven't complained.
I'd better go check that out.
Hey, turn it down.
Will you leave me alone?
Would you stop smiling at me?
Oh, you are such a goody two-shoes.
That is so true.
Well, at least you admit it.
You know, I'd like you a lot more if you'd just make fun of people.
But I suppose you would never do that.
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.
That's a start.
You're gonna ruin your dinner.
My parents let me eat ice cream whenever I want.
My nanny said it would rot my teeth, so I put her in a jar.
You know, you should find other ways of dealing with people.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just that, you know, you don't have to put everyone you don't like in a jar.
That's what my psychologist said.
So I put him in a jar.
- Brat.
- I heard that one.
Slow down, M'Lady.
Hey, I can handle it.
And that's Harold and me in front of our villa.
You know, if either one of you ever has a honeymoon, you really must take it in the south of France.
On second thought, don't wait.
I wouldn't want you to miss out.
Excuse me.
I am in no hurry to get married.
That's right.
Hilda is single completely by choice, because she refuses to settle for any of the losers she's been dating.
And, Zelda, what's your excuse?
Zelda doesn't need an excuse.
She's passionate about her intellectual pursuits.
Her love life is all in her head.
Mommy, look what I did.
- Is that Sabrina?
- What did you do to her?
She wouldn't colour with me.
That is so cute.
Can we please go home now?
I'm really not having any fun.
I'll colour with you, Amanda.
Please let me out.
I chose Jackie because-- Well, I sort of see myself as the first lady of Westbridge High.
- That is so true.
- Thanks.
This party is dying.
We gotta do something.
Oh, man, the onion dip is bubbling.
What this party needs is something big, something wild.
I know.
Someone should streak.
It's fun, it's fast, it's naked.
I'd love to.
- You'd streak?
- I'd love to.
Sabrina, this is a whole new you.
Man, this party is boring.
I'd leave if it weren't mine.
Harvey, I've got it taken care of.
Sabrina's going to streak.
What?
You're kidding.
Sabrina, look, I appreciate you trying to help out my party, but streaking is never the answer.
Don't you know you'll be teased for the rest of high school?
That is so true.
Then why are you doing it?
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.
Don't change the subject.
Look, this isn't like you.
Why are you acting so weird?
I'd-- Mister-- I can't even talk to you.
I feel so alienated.
Salem, you're the only one who understands me.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean I care.
Dinner's over.
Can we go now?
We got you out of the jar.
Stop whining.
All right, everyone, time to open presents.
Yay!
- Amanda, darling, you go first.
This better be good.
Nothing like watching Halloween through the eyes of a spoiled child.
A solid-gold dolly.
Thank you, Mommy.
It's from Mommy and Daddy.
We got Sabrina something too.
Oh, here you go.
It's from both of us.
Happy Halloween.
Oh, nice card.
Kids love those.
It's a gift certificate to spend half an hour with the deceased of your choice.
What's this?
You got her a reanimation?
Those are very pricey.
I want a reanimation.
I want a reanimation.
I want a reanimation!
This is the weirdest gift.
What do I do with it?
It's yours to spend as you like.
But you must use it tonight.
The gap between the living and the dead is weakest on All Hallows Eve.
Well, then maybe one of you should use it.
I just wanna get back to Harvey's party and see him dressed like James Dean.
Why not meet the real James Dean?
- I could do that?
Mm-hm.
How does it work?
Now, you just fill in the name of who you wanna see, and put it through that mail slot.
Now, how do I know I'm gonna get the real James Dean and not the sausage guy?
First of all, the sausage guy is still alive.
But just in case, write, "Star of Rebel Without a Cause".
This is so great.
Wait.
I have a better idea.
There.
- Now what?
- We leave.
This is your own personal, private moment.
- Who'd you choose?
- Hilda.
Sabrina.
Granny?
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, I've missed you too.
Oh, let me take a look at you.
You look so sweet in that dress.
That was a lovely gift.
Harold gave me this.
I picked it out myself.
Which reminds me, Hilda, I got you a little something.
Zelda, you said we weren't gonna exchange gifts this year.
I know, but I couldn't help myself.
Me neither.
Thank God you have each other.
We've been living together way too long.
M' Give that back.
I know when I've had enough catnip.
Oh, no, the cat's soused again.
Why does one of our relatives always have to get drunk?
You are not gonna believe what M'Lady just blurted out.
- What?
Come close.
Marigold and her husband are getting a divorce.
I don't believe it.
Marigold is splitting up with Harold?
Oh, this is the best Halloween ever.
So I moved in with Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda.
They do more weird things before - They take really good care of me.
- I always liked them.
So tell me, how's school?
- Do you still like science?
- Yeah.
My teacher, Mr. Pool, can be so annoying, but he's actually a good guy.
Do you have a boyfriend yet?
There's a guy I like.
His name's Harvey.
But right now we're just sort of friends.
Oh, well, he'd be a fool if he doesn't fall for you.
You think I'm the prettiest girl in the world.
That's because you are, and smart too.
Thanks, but, Granny, there's something I wanna tell you, only, well, it's kind of strange.
Well, Sabrina, you know you can always tell me anything.
I'm a witch.
Well, dear, as long as you're happy.
The clock's ticking.
Why don't you go outside and find a place to strip?
I'd love to.
You know, Sabrina, your new do-what-I-say attitude is really great.
Pay attention, everyone.
Midnight is 15 minutes away, and I think you should all pay attention to those windows.
Why, did the Kinkles put on some cheesy ghost show?
No, but watch closely and you might see a full moon.
M'Lady also said Marigold went to the south of France alone.
But we saw Harold in the pictures.
That was a cardboard cutout.
I'm back.
Oh, how was it?
It was an amaZing gift.
I got to see my granny again and tell her everything's okay.
Thanks, Aunt Zelda.
Thanks, Aunt Hilda.
We're glad you liked it.
And now it's time to leave.
Amanda, darling, when someone gives you a gift, you're supposed to say thank you.
Fine.
Thank you.
Now, that's verging on rude.
We've come to say goodbye and to thank you.
You've made our evening in so many ways.
We hope it wasn't too stressful, you know, planning the party, preparing the food, divorcing Harold.
No, it-- What?
Oh, we know all about it.
The cat blabbed.
But don't worry, you'll love being alone.
Filling your days with romance novels, Lean Cuisines, Internet chat rooms.
Oh, God.
I'm going to be just like you.
Oh, Hilda, we've made her cry.
Oh, how awful we must feel.
Let's go.
You know, I really had a good time.
- Me too.
Me three.
I told you family gatherings were fun.
It's still better to be a divorcÃ©e than a spinster, right?
Ah, stuff it.
Mommy, I'm hungry.
I want a hamburger.
Not now, dear.
It's not a good time.
But I want it now.
Now.
Now.
Now-- I think somebody needs a time-out.
You'll be sorry.
I'm telling Daddy where you hid the silver.
Oh, really?
Whoa.
What happened to Harvey's party?
Oh, I decided to stay in and read some of Granny's letters.
Are you nuts?
You can't leave a double running around.
Oh, I forgot.
I gotta change.
Wait, I'm a witch.
Now, I've got your clothes.
I'll wait for you on the other side.
Count of 10.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, - five, four, - Oops.
I'm already here.
three, two, one.
- Hey, what's everyone looking at?
- Sabrina's gonna streak.
There she is.
I can't believe Sabrina did that.
I didn't.
- That wasn't me.
- Sabrina, you're here.
- Yeah, where else would I be?
- Libby couldn't make you streak.
But then who was that?
I don't see Libby anywhere.
I guess it must've been her.
That was Libby?
Hey, everybody, that was Libby streaking.
Wasn't that fun?
I'm glad you all enjoyed it.
How'd you get in here so quick?
What?
I've been here the whole time.
I just gave you your clothes outside.
Oh, give it up, Libby.
We all know you're the one who streaked.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
We saw your butt.
That was not me.
You are all so immature.
Well, my aunts were right.
Halloween is a magical night.
I know I blew up at you before, but do you think you could stay late and help me clean up?
I'd love to.
I mean, I'd really enjoy that.
But first I've gotta get some fresh air.
Hey, I don't blame you.
Those expiration dates are a lot more precise than you'd think.
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Hey, look at you.
You put your dress on backwards.
Man, I'm a mess.
Come on, let's get it together.
Great.
Everything is back to normal.
That is so true.
Weird.
Hi, I'd like to take half a minute to talk to you about the true meaning of Halloween.
It's not about candy and costumes.
It's about family and showing them how much you care.
So don't buy into the hype and commercialisation of the season.
This Halloween, stay home with your loved ones.
Just gather round the jack-o'-lantern, and remember, the true meaning of Halloween is inside you.
Right, Salem?
There's a pound of candy corn inside me.
Ignore him.
Happy Halloween.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
That's for me.
Hello.
Hi, Harvey.
Sure, ask away.
Wait, one second.
- Aunt Zelda, do you mind?
- Oh, no, go right ahead.
No, I mean would you leave me alone?
Oh, I get it.
Sorry.
You were saying?
One more sec.
Salem, are you spying on me?
I'm a cat, I'm curious, so kill me.
- Out.
Fine.
I understand the delicacy of the moment.
Harvey and Sabrina Harvey and Sabrina  You were asking?
No, Mr. Pool said photosynthesis would not be on the test.
Is that it?
Okay.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
There, there.
I'm sure Harvey will ask you out on a date someday.
Thanks, Louisa.
You were listening?
I have no privacy in this house.
Harvey and Sabrina Harvey and Sabrina Feeling groovy.
Far out.
I just don't get how people can dance with all these tables here.
Sasha, we'll move the tables.
It looks like I'm going to the dance.
- Who with?
- Me.
Dates are just society's way of keeping numbers even.
I'm gonna represent all things that are odd.
And I'm sure that's exactly how people will see it.
Do you wanna come with me?
We could go alone, together.
No, thanks.
I was thinking it might be kind of fun to go with Harvey.
- Are you gonna ask him?
- Oh, I can't.
I don't wanna complicate our friendship.
What if he asked you?
Oh, well, I don't mind if he complicates our friendship.
Hey, Harvey.
Over here.
Thanks for waving.
I might not have spotted you at the same table where we always sit.
So do you have plans for the dance tomorrow night?
Oops.
Gotta run.
Man, I've never seen her move so fast.
So you were saying about the dance?
Oh, I probably won't go.
School dances aren't my thing.
How about you?
Oh, I haven't made any plans, you know, yet.
- Hi, Harvey.
Can I borrow a finger?
- Sure.
Excuse me, we were talking.
Other people have fingers too, you know?
Yes, but Harvey works out.
And by the way, Harvey, I was thinking you and I could go to the dance together, okay?
- Okay.
Great.
Thanks for helping.
Okay?
I thought you said school dances weren't your thing.
They're not.
I panicked.
I have a hard time saying no.
I really should work on that.
No.
Aunt Zelda, I need help.
- Well, of course.
What is it?
- Well, it's kind of private.
- Did someone say private?
- Yes.
I'm intrigued.
Continue.
Okay, I'll tell you my problem if you promise to keep it a secret.
Well, I wanted to go to the dance tonight with this guy.
- Harvey.
- Right.
- But he's going with this other girl.
- Libby.
Okay, and then what happens?
Oh, sweetie, if Harvey likes Libby, that's his choice.
No, but I don't think he does.
I mean, she asked him.
And because he has a problem saying no, he said yes.
Then why didn't you ask him?
Because then he would know that I liked him.
- But you do.
- Yes, but I can't tell him that.
Have you at least dropped a hint?
Well, I smile at him a lot, and sometimes when we play foosball, I let him win.
He'll never figure it out that way.
If you like Harvey, you'll have to tell him.
You may even wanna use one of these.
A sledgehammer?
I think I'd rather just use a love spell, but I can't seem to find one in my magic book.
Oh, Sabrina, I hate to disappoint you, but there is no love spell.
Love is far too precious to tamper with.
You mean too weird.
That's why there's no standardiZed formula.
Although Calvin Klein came remarkably close with Obsession.
So being a witch doesn't help me at all?
Well, in this case, no.
Not necessarily.
You can't make someone love you, but you can imprison them in a ring for not loving you.
See?
Hilda, let me out.
Thou art starting to grow on me.
I love the way he catches the light.
Look, trapping Harvey in amber is not exactly what I had in mind.
I think I need to be alone again.
Oh, that privacy thing?
Hilda, let's go.
We'll be downstairs if you need us.
That's right.
We're here.
We care.
And we have pie.
That stinks.
Harvey or no Harvey, she should go to the ball.
I mean dance.
Sabrina needs someone who's hip and fun, who'll make her forget Harvey.
I know.
Do we have any Man Dough in the house?
Great idea.
I'll race you to the kitchen.
Beat you.
Oh, you are so immature.
Do you mind?
I'm busy staring into space.
You can do that later.
We're making Sabrina a dream date.
Whoa.
My kibble.
Dream date.
Got your nose.
Here's your ears.
There.
Wait a minute.
One arm is shorter than the other.
Hilda, have you been eating dough?
No.
Now for the personality glaZe.
Pour it on.
Let's make him a great dancer.
- And a daredevil.
- And a musician.
Do girls still like musicians?
Ever since MoZart's Feel the Heat tour.
Uh-oh.
- I overdid the enthusiasm.
- He's going to a high school dance.
He's gonna need all the enthusiasm he can get.
What are you cooking?
Something smells - handsome?
- Sabrina, you're gonna love it.
We're making you a dream date out of Man Dough.
Man Dough?
He'll be tall, dark and yeasty.
Now, he'll last about four hours, which is perfect for your dance.
Yeah, perfect.
Except for the fact that I wanted to go with Harvey, not Poppin' Fresh.
Oh, now, come on, just meet him before you make up your mind.
You're gonna like him.
He's really enthusiastic.
I've already made up my mind.
I'm not going.
- Man's done.
- Man's done.
Hey.
Hi.
Man, am I happy to be here.
Wow, he is really cute.
Well, we do nice work.
But if you don't wanna go to the dance-- Changed my mind, I'll go.
Just give me a sec to get ready.
All set.
Gotta go.
Man, you look great.
And this dance sounds fantastic.
Oh, man.
This place is fantastic.
What do you call it?
- The cafeteria.
- Cafeteria.
Cafeteria.
I'll have to remember that.
Whoa, great bunting.
Could you keep it down?
You're talking kind of loud.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Who are you?
I'm Jenny.
Who are you?
This is Chad Corey Dylan.
- Great name.
- Thanks.
Uh, Chad, could you get us some punch?
She has the best ideas.
- So, what do you think?
- Looks cute.
- Where did you meet him?
- Oh, my aunts introduced us.
We rode over on his motorcycle.
I approve.
Yeah, Chad's pretty neat, you know, for an athlete-daredevil-rock musician.
Guess what, they have two flavours, orange and red.
Go easy, Chad.
Well, I'm going to dance.
Wait a second, we can dance here?
Yeah, do you like dancing?
I'm made to dance.
And I love this song.
Here, excuse me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Sasha, what have I missed?
Not much.
Where have you been?
We had some engine trouble with the 'vette on the way over.
You drive a Corvette?
That's Chevette.
Hey, same manufacturer.
Oh, please.
Oh, my God.
Who's the guy Sabrina's with?
His name's Chad Corey Dylan.
And yes, that's his motorcycle outside.
- Well, I guess Sabrina wins.
- I don't think so.
Come on, Harvey.
Let's hit the floor.
Actually, Libby, I don't dance.
Excuse me?
This is a dance.
Guess what we do here.
Well, see, for me, dance is sort of a metaphor.
For what?
I don't know, something else?
I can't believe you did this to me.
Sasha, ladies' room.
- Oh, man, I'm having a great time.
- Me too.
Well, why'd you stop dancing?
I just saw someone.
- Who?
- Just a friend.
This is fun.
We haven't done this since the Taft administration.
What'd you put in your personality?
I gave him lots of optimism.
I want my dream date to be hopeful.
Oh, that's nice.
Mine's done.
Hi, I'm Hilda.
Would you get off my back?
I've been looking for work.
Stop riding me.
- He doesn't sound too hopeful.
- Something must've gone wrong.
Did you check the expiration date on the optimism?
Oh, no.
It says, "hope fades".
- Which means - My dream date is hopeless.
Ladies, you wanna break up the hen party?
Somewhere, men are competing in a professional sport and I'm missing it.
So where's the TV?
Never mind, I'll find it myself.
TV.
TV I have the worst luck with men, even the ones made out of dough.
- Here, do you wanna start over?
- Yes.
No.
Wait.
I have an idea.
Maybe I can change him.
Oh, Hilda.
You know that never works.
But I love a challenge.
First, I'll gain his trust by pretending to be interested in sports.
Wait.
Don't you even wanna see who my dream date is?
Let me guess.
He's a brave, milk-swilling fireman.
How did you know?
I found the calendar in your desk.
Sabrina's right.
There's no privacy in this home.
Oh, hello, kitten.
Got milk?
What?
Oh, sorry.
I thought you're talking to me.
Oh, man.
This is the best night of my life.
Do you mind if we stop?
I'm sort of tired.
Oh, sure, go ahead.
Although I gotta say, I love this song.
Oh, well, then keep dancing.
Jenny, cover for me.
All right.
Don't be long, I don't want people thinking I sold out.
Hi, Harvey.
You busy?
No, I dropped a chip in the punch.
- You look nice.
- Thanks.
So do you.
This is what I wore to school yesterday.
Oh, well, you smell okay.
So where's Libby?
Bathroom, I guess.
She's mad at me because I don't dance.
Really?
I would have thought you'd be good at that.
Well, I'm okay when it's just me rocking out in my room.
I mean, I don't spin around a pole or anything.
But I get really self-conscious in front of other people.
- We all do.
- Not your date.
Oh, well, Chad's kind of special.
Wow.
You really like him, don't you?
No, I meant like different.
Hey, there you are.
Hi, I'm Chad Corey Dylan.
Harvey Dwight Kinkle.
It's nice to meet you.
Hey, Sabrina, you gotta get back here.
You wouldn't believe what you're missing.
A great song?
She knows everything.
Oh, you're back.
I thought maybe you'd fallen in.
Charming.
What are you thinking?
That ref's a jerk.
You know, we could talk while we watch sports.
I mean, relationships are built on communication.
Why don't you share your feelings?
Why don't you share the chips?
Simon, the point I'm trying to make-- Look, when we get to a boring commercial, we'll make out.
Until then, you mind?
I've never seen a man drink so much milk.
I like milk.
I don't understand why you didn't just say no when I asked you to this dance.
I told you, I'm working on it.
All right, a slow dance.
You know, Chad, I'm really not into slow dances.
Why don't we go over and stand by those chairs?
Genius.
That is genius.
This is too weird, even for me.
If you don't wanna be here, just leave.
Look, I don't tell many people this, but-- There he is.
Hi, I'm Libby.
Hi, I'm Chad.
Saw you dancing out there.
You're really good.
Oh, well, I'm also a daredevil and a rock musician.
Oh, really?
What instrument do you play?
Lead guitar.
Pfft.
Lead guitar.
Hey, Harvey, don't you play an instrument?
Yeah, the bassoon.
Wow.
The bassoon.
I think that's really sexy.
Maybe to another bassoon.
Oh, man, I love this song.
Me too.
Unfortunately, my date can't dance.
Yes, he can.
As a matter of fact, Harvey is a wonderful dancer.
Sabrina, technically, that's not true.
Yes, it is.
And why don't you prove it to them?
Now.
Okay, maybe I know a few steps.
Yeah, Harvey's dancing alone, all right.
- He's actually better than Chad.
- Much better.
- Did anyone see that?
- Everyone saw it.
Now I feel really self-conscious.
- Let's dance.
I feel inspired.
But-- - I better go.
- What?
I wanna dance with you now.
Sorry, Libby, but you said I could leave if I wanted to.
I take it back.
You have to dance with me.
Libby, no.
Look, Chad, this doesn't feel right.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, I gotta go.
Harvey?
Harvey?
Harvey?
I'm over here.
I thought you were leaving.
Yeah, well, I wanted to, but now I have to wait for AAA.
Well, I can help you wait.
I'm good at that.
Watch.
Thanks, but shouldn't you be inside with what's-his-name, what's-his-name, what's-his-name?
No, he's not really my type.
What, perfect isn't your type?
Actually, Harvey, I wanted to talk to you about that.
But it's kind of hard for me.
- What do you mean?
- Well, the thing is, I - See-- - Sabrina, what is it?
FreeZe.
Look, the thing is I came to this party expecting to have a good time with Chad, but one look at you and it was over.
I mean, I think it's great that we're friends, but sometimes I wish it were more.
I like you, Harvey.
I like you a lot, but I guess for now, this is the closest I can get to saying it to your face.
Thanks for listening.
Did you just say something?
Yeah, I said Chad isn't really perfect.
You know, one arm's longer than the other.
Well, I'd better get back.
Sabrina, I was wondering, since we're out here, do you wanna dance?
Won't you feel self-conscious?
It's just us.
- So do you love this song?
- It's okay.
I'm starting to get a little self-conscious.
Okay, I'm there.
Sorry, that's all I can do.
It was enough.
I think I'm ready to go home now.
Well, hey, if you're done with the dance, do you wanna head over to the Slicery and play foosball?
Yeah, I love foosball.
Sorry, I've been hanging out with Chad too long.
Well, I'll go tell him I'm leaving.
I like you, Sabrina.
Why can't I say it to her face?
Sabrina, you're back.
Chad, we need to talk.
Look, it was sweet of you to bring me to the dance, but you're not the one I wanna be with.
- Well, who do you wanna be with?
- Harvey.
That's an excellent choice.
He's a great guy.
You really are a dream date, Chad.
So, uh, it's okay if I leave?
Oh, sure.
No, go ahead.
I'll just stay here and miss you.
I don't want you to do that.
Look, you only have two hours left, and I'm sure you love this song, so why not ask Libby to dance?
- Can I?
I like Libby.
- You like Libby?
Sorry, I guess I'm starting to go bad.
All right, foos it or lose it.
Hey, look, same length.
Ha.
So if you live by the past, you die by the past.
They kept the ball on the ground and they were able to convert in the red Zone.
You know, I can't hear Pat Summerall while you're yapping.
- It's a hardware commercial.
- Shh.
He's talking about hammers.
Okay, that's it.
- Done.
- Nineteen seconds.
- Yes.
- Coming through.
Be back in a jiff.
So, what now?
Well, I could register your bike or make lasagne for 50.
Could you teach me the Heimlich?
Sure, but first I need a milk break to fortify my body and build healthy teeth and bones.
Yes.
I finally got through to Simon.
Well, since my dream date turned out to be a dud, I guess we'll have to share yours.
Oh!
Oh, no.
No, I'm not sharing.
- He's mine.
- Be nice.
- I made him.
Let go.
- I won't.
Let go.
Let go.
Now look what you've done.
My milk.
He's damaged now.
Can I have him?
Oh, man, I love this song.
You and I are so right for each other.
Must find preservatives.
Chad?
Chad?
Chad?
Chad?
Ew.
Oh, gross.
I had a really great time.
Oh, man, I love this song.
Are you a detective?
Okay, I'd like to report a missing person.
Chad Corey Dylan.
Well, he's really tall, and he's really cute.
He was last seen dancing with me.
Everyone was looking.
It was so cool.
What?
Well, he's only been gone No, I will not wait 24 hours.
Don't you people realise this is the love of my life?
Hello?
Hello?
Ooh!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
No, no, no.
- But it's my belly button.
- Uh-uh.
It's our belly button.
You can have it back when you turn 18.
Don't tell me she still wants to hang keys off her navel.
Sabrina, even I think that's gross.
- I still wanna do it.
- You'll regret it.
I had to wait two centuries to have the "Cromwell Rules" tattoo removed from my shoulder.
- That's not where it was.
- Be quiet.
The point is, these things go in and out of style.
You have to remember, you're built for the long haul.
Well, I think it's cool.
But if I have to wait two years, fine, I will.
Then I'll just have everything pierced.
Okay, very funny.
Now, remove the bone.
Remove the bone.
I'm not going to school like this.
It's camouflage.
I'm over here.
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song - Hey, what are you singing?
- Nothing.
- Are you going to science?
- I figured I'm here, might as well.
So I was thinking about going to see a movie Saturday night.
You wanna come?
Sure, but it's gotta be an early show.
My curfew's midnight.
You're so lucky your aunts are strict.
My parents are really relaxed which makes it hard to rebel.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.
All right, turn it down.
"Shake your whammy fanny".
Oh, please.
You know, in my day we had good music.
Mr. Pool, didn't you grow up in the '70s?
Yes.
Never mind.
Okay, today we're gonna talk about the body's largest organ: the skin.
Heh.
Now, the skin consists of three different layers: the dermis, the epidermis, and the subcutaneous tissue.
What's happening?
I feel like I'm wearing a burlap unitard.
God, I can't stand the itching!
God!
Ah!
What do we do now?
Well, if Mr. Pool's not back in five minutes, we can ditch.
- It's been five minutes, hasn't it?
- Let's go.
Sit.
Stay.
Good.
Hello, class.
I am your substitute teacher.
My name is Vesta.
I'm an Aries.
Now, doesn't anyone want to tell me where your teacher left off?
- You, spill.
- Ooh We were talking about skin.
Always moisturiZe and use an exfoliant.
Any questions?
Yes?
What does moisturiZer have to do with science?
Ha-ha-ha.
Science isn't everything.
What about beauty and art and culture?
Why do we have to focus on science?
Because this is biology?
Fine.
You want science?
Listen carefully.
The thermablasts join the ranials, which, I think, explains it all.
Well, that's it for today.
Forget everything I said.
Class dismissed.
Except Sabrina.
You stay after.
- What did I do?
- I don't know.
You're not out in five minutes, I'm notifying the school paper.
Great.
It's a weekly.
Sabrina, we need to talk.
- Did I do something wrong?
- Yes.
No.
Don't you recognise me?
- Should I?
- Ah.
I'll give you a hint.
I am your Aunt Vesta.
Let me guess, from my father's side of the family?
Bingo.
Heh.
I even carry a photo of me holding you as a baby.
Oh, look.
- There's Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda.
- Mm.
- Is that Andy Warhol?
- Mm.
Those were the good times.
I don't know why, but the '80s are always the best decade of every century.
Oh, look, I'd really love to stay and talk, but I've gotta get to class.
Don't be silly.
We have a lot of catching up to do.
Now, where can we find a cup of good coffee?
Oh, I know, Paris.
VoilÃ .
Ha-ha-ha.
You know the weirdest thing?
I'm missing French class to be here.
No, that's not the weirdest thing.
I once-- Oh, no, never mind.
I think I should have told someone I was leaving the country.
Don't be so jittery.
Drink your giant bowl of coffee and relax.
Three sips and I'm vibrating.
My other aunts don't let me drink coffee.
Yes.
The evil bean.
I'm sure they're full of all sorts of can'ts and don'ts, like:  "Don't stay up too late,"  and "No, you can't get a tattoo".
You sound just like them.
We lived together for 200 years, but we're very, very different.
You see, they actually enjoy living on Earth and I can't stand mortals for too long.
You know, I'm half mortal.
Oh, not that there's anything wrong with that, darling.
It's just that, well, mortals seem to have to work so hard for everything.
Tends to make them bitter.
- Oh, like my teacher, Mr. Pool.
- Exactly.
- What did you do to him anyway?
- Oh, I just gave him a 24-hour bug.
My point is that we witches can avoid reality if we choose.
That's why I live in the Pleasuredome.
- The Pleasuredome, where's that?
- Heh.
The other realm.
- You could come and visit.
- I don't think my aunts would let me.
Well, we'll just have to convince them.
Look, it's been this way for years.
It's time for a change.
I like it the other way.
I'm not gonna stand here all day pointing with you.
Listen up.
That was Sabrina's school on the phone.
They said she missed her last five classes.
That's not like her.
Where could she be?
- What if she's in trouble?
- Oh, I hope she's not in trouble.
I'm home.
- Oh.
You are in big trouble.
- Where have you been?
And what are you wearing?
I went to Paris with Aunt Vesta.
ZELDA AND  Vesta?
Presents.
- Gum?
- It's French.
What are you doing here?
I thought you vowed never to set foot on Earth again.
How could I stay away?
I had to see my niece.
She was supposed to be in school.
Well, we tried to make her last class.
But then we stopped in Milano for gelato.
You have to.
No, you don't.
You have to tell people when you run off to Europe for snacks.
And you can't just take Sabrina out of school.
Oh.
I'm only here five seconds and it's already can'ts and don'ts.
Doesn't anything ever change around here?
Oh!
We got new fabric for the chair.
It's mayhem.
Look, Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, I'm sorry I didn't call.
I was wrong.
- Can I keep the clothes?
- Oh, all right.
But go call Jenny, get your homework and start doing it.
It's practically done.
Such a sweet girl and so hungry for life.
Surprising, I mean, with the example you've been setting for her.
We are setting a fine example.
We have a loving home filled with discipline and responsibility.
- What about fun?
- We have fun.
In fact, this weekend I have been invited to attend a very important meeting in Texas on the Supercollider.
So there.
I'll get it.
It's probably somebody fun.
I doubt it.
So a symposium in Texas.
Who invited you?
The Visual Engineers for the Study of Theoretical Activity.
I suppose theoretical activity is better than no activity at all.
You are not gonna believe this.
I've just been asked to play with the Conniff Trio in Orlando this Saturday.
It's a dream come true.
Hilda, lucky you.
I know you mean that sarcastically, but thanks.
- I have to pack.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can't just take off.
I have to go to Texas this weekend.
What about Sabrina?
We can't leave her alone.
Then we have to find someone she can stay with.
Maybe I can be of help.
Jenny just gave me the bad news.
I have to read 50 pages by Monday.
Quelle drag.
Sabrina, since Hilda and I have to work, how would you feel about spending the weekend at your Aunt Vesta's Pleasuredome?
I'd really like that, but I'm afraid if I'm too enthusiastic you won't let me.
It's fine.
In fact, it would help us.
Then, yes!
Whoo-hoo!
Oh.
It's so good to be home.
Welcome to the Pleasuredome.
Ha-ha-ha.
Leave your can'ts and your don'ts outside.
We only have one rule here.
Ha-ha.
No mortals.
Great.
What a cool place.
So I guess you're really into doors.
Behind each one is a wish fulfilled.
Go ahead, take a look.
- What's in there?
- You'll see.
BAND : --your fanny whammy Funky song, funky song Shake your fanny whammy Funky song - Is this what I think it is?
- Yes.
You're backstage at a Brothers Chunk concert.
Ha-ha.
- Phat.
- Wait.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Open this one.
It's one of my personal faves.
- What is it?
- The Hall of Gratuitous Praise.
You're fabulous.
We love you.
You're gorgeous.
You're beautiful.
You're in.
Yes, you are.
Ah.
That was fun.
You know, I feel really good about myself.
We also have a 24-hour mall and a restaurant filled with ooey-gooey slimming desserts.
And that's a room filled with gorgeous, single men.
- Maybe I'll just take a peek in there.
- No, don't.
Darling, they know you're here.
And the longer you keep them waiting, the more they'll want you.
Oh, so that's how is works?
Uh-huh.
So we'll save that room until later.
But I'm only here for the weekend.
Well, we'll see about that.
Bonbons?
- Oh.
Is this Room 107?
- Yes.
Well, that's strange.
See, there's supposed to be a lecture here.
- Be kind of crowded.
- Heh.
Well, do you know anything about a Supercollider conference?
No, and I'm always the last to.
Well, the invitation says 107.
And it's engraved.
Nice.
Who's it from?
The Visual Engineers for the Study of Theoretical Activity.
Why didn't they just shorten it to VESTA?
Vesta.
Hilda.
Hilda.
Zelda, what are you doing here?
Vesta set me up, and she set you up too.
I wondered why they booked a string trio at Daytona.
Well, there's your big finish.
- Come on, let's go.
- All right.
But Vesta's trick backfired.
Our trio just got booked at the Indy 500.
What are you reading?
Jude the Obscure.
I'll say.
Hey, wanna learn the Macarena?
I can't.
I promised Hilda and Zelda I'd do my homework.
Sabrina, tsk, we need to talk.
Did I do something wrong?
No, it's just your priorities.
Isn't this obsession with homework getting in the way of your fun?
- Well, I have to study.
- Why?
Because you can't have fun all the time.
Why not?
Think about that while we join a conga line.
- Anyone want paella?
- I do.
Stop.
What is going on here?
Welcome to homework land.
Move it along.
There's nothing to see here.
How could you?
You tricked us to get Sabrina up here.
Der-hay.
Well, the party's over.
Sabrina is coming home.
You know the rules around here.
Now, that Sabrina is at the Pleasuredome, she can do whatever she wants.
So that's your plan.
Please, I don't plan.
I scheme.
And forgive me for wanting my niece to have a little fun.
I have heard enough.
Come on, Sabrina, we're going home.
- She's staying here.
- She's coming home.
- Staying.
- You are so selfish.
- You two always gang up on me.
- Excuse me!
Can I say something about my life?
Look, you guys didn't tell me I could stay in the other realm if I wanted to.
I didn't know I had a choice.
- Well, you do.
- Of course you do.
And we know you'll make the right one.
I will.
I'm staying here.
OlÃ©.
How can you choose the Pleasuredome over high school?
Wait, that didn't come out right.
Why don't you guys stay too?
We're having paella.
No, thanks.
We have real lives back on Earth.
- Come on, Hilda.
Let's go.
- What?
We can't just leave her here.
Follow me, I have a hunch.
And don't look back.
Ciao, adios.
Okay, drama's over.
Let's hit the waterslide.
Uh-oh.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just thought they'd toss around a few more can'ts and don'ts before taking off.
Are you insane?
You left without a fight.
- What were you thinking?
- That I want Sabrina to come home.
Me too.
Now, let's go back and get her.
- I'll hold Vesta.
- No, that won't work.
If we tell Sabrina she can't stay, then we'll just be playing into Vesta's hand.
Can we say it and just not use the work "can't"?
Hilda, we're giving Sabrina a chance to change her mind.
Have a little faith.
I think she'll come home.
Ooh, Zelda, sneaky.
You had a scheme.
Well, Vesta is my sister.
I want a scheme.
Mmm.
That's good.
So good.
There's only one thing that could make this better.
Now, this is relaxing.
I'm wiped.
I rode the roller coaster 17 times, went shoe shopping, - saw the Brad Pitt IMAX,  Uh-huh.
and, man, those hot tubs take a lot out of you.
Poor thing.
I just wanna curl up with a good book.
Oh, Sabrina.
Oh, well.
We need to talk.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
Why do you always assume when we need to talk, you did something wrong?
Because I'm a teenager?
Anyway, you can't stay home and read on a Saturday night.
Not when you can could be starring in your own rock video.
- I can?
- Yes, sure.
All you need to do is come up with a concept.
Oh, easy.
Okay, we open on smoke rolling across the floor, cue the dancing clowns and widen to reveal me in a really great outfit.
Phone.
Thank you.
Hello?
One moment.
It's for you.
- For me?
- Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey, Sabrina.
What's up?
Not much.
How'd you get my number?
I called you and your aunts gave it to me.
It had the weirdest Well, I'm visiting family in Canada.
I thought we were going to a movie tonight.
I totally forgot.
I'm sorry, Jenny.
Look, maybe I can get back.
Your video.
Well, can't she come watch?
The one rule.
Figures.
Look, Jenny, I'm sort of stuck here, but, well, you'll find something fun to do tonight, right?
Sure.
Yeah, it's no problem.
Anyway, I'll see you.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Oh, you're sad.
This will cheer you up.
Look, a puppy.
Isn't he cute?
You can't distract me with a puppy, Aunt Vesta.
I feel awful.
Okay, remove the puppy.
All right, what's wrong?
Jenny's my best friend, and I just realised if I stay here, I'll never see her again.
I'll never see any of my friends again.
Is that all that's bothering you?
You can see your friends any time you want.
- I can?
- Yes.
We have super-secret Inside-O-Vision.
- Cool.
- Very.
I'm looking for Ringo's nose.
That should not be hard to find.
Oh, I've been working on it.
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.
Still can't believe Sabrina doesn't think our lives are exciting enough.
Well, you can see how it snoops.
With this remote, you can see anyone, anywhere.
- Now, who else do you wanna watch?
- How about Salem?
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song, funky song Shake your whammy fanny Funky song  What's he doing?
He's got squeaky toys all over my room.
- Oh-ho, you live here now.
- Oh.
Right.
Well, let's see what Harvey's doing.
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song I don't wanna see this.
Uh-- I know.
I'll check on Jenny.
She's probably out though.
No, wait, she's home and she's reading Jude the Obscure.
How pathetic.
But it's my fault she's stuck home on a Saturday night.
I totally stood her up.
Hey, you are in a guilt-free Zone.
Now, what about we shake our whammy fannies and get your video ready?
Funky song Come on, Sabrina.
I am dying to see what you look like.
I don't know whether to get funky or go fly-fishing.
You look fabulous.
- These boots are killing me.
- Deal with it.
There's no room for sensible shoes in rock 'n' roll.
Now, you are large and in charge.
All right, camera ready.
Lights, smoke and action.
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song, funky song Shake your whammy fanny Funky song - All right.
- Whoo!
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song, funky song Shake your whammy fanny Funky song Come on, energy up.
Up.
Shake it, shake it, shake-- Shake your tangly wambly Shake-- Oh, no, that's it.
I can't shake anymore.
Cut.
This is a mistake.
Aunt Vesta, we need to talk.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, I did.
Look, I shouldn't be here.
I should be at the movies with Jenny.
Oh.
But that's so ordinary.
I mean, you could be a rock star.
I'm not a rock star.
I'm a karaoke singer.
And not a very good one at that.
I think someone needs a little trip to the Hall of Gratuitous Praise.
No.
I don't wanna go to the Hall of Gratuitous Praise.
I wanna go home.
Sabrina, you can't go.
I'll be so lonely without you.
Well, you can come stay with Hilda and Zelda and me.
Maybe I'll just get that puppy back.
I'd better run.
Jenny and I can still make a late show.
You know, that is if Hilda and Zelda let me break curfew.
Oh, I guess you'd be needing this.
Ahem.
Thanks.
You know, I had fun.
This is the Pleasuredome.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Oh.
What now?
We love you.
You're beautiful.
You're gorgeous.
You're wonderful.
You're fabulous-- So empty.
But it works.
You're fabulous.
You're beautiful.
You're gorgeous.
Salem, what are you doing?
Uh-- I was just reorganiZing?
You know, I saw you singing in the mirror.
No.
- Did you hear something?
- Yes.
Be cool.
Hi, I'm home.
Oh, hello, Sabrina.
What happened?
Didn't you like the Pleasuredome?
It was okay.
But the truth is, without can'ts and don'ts, it's hard to know where the fun is.
It's sure nice to have you back.
And it's nice to be back.
Now, can I go out?
I promised Jenny that I'd go to the movies with her and I feel I should honour that responsibility.
- You can go.
- But don't stay out past 1.
And you can't wear those boots.
I'm home.
Better?
Gotta go.
And thanks for not making a big deal out of this.
- Deal of the century.
- She's back.
She's back.
Yes!
Yes!
Now, what?
Just let me grab these canisters.
All right, I'm ready for you, little weevil.
Come closer.
Come a little closer.
Suck potpourri and die!
Oh, man, what a dream.
Sushi and Kafka don't mix.
Ah!
Bug!
A bug!
Gah!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- Phone's for you.
- I didn't hear it ring.
I was on another call.
I think it's Harvey.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Scat.
I hate when she says that.
- Hello?
BOY : Hey, Sabrina.
- Hi, Harvey.
- Got a question.
Sure, ask away.
What pages are we supposed to read for Mr. Pool's class?
Just the chapter on digestion up to the large intestine.
- Is that it?
- No.
Actually, I'm not calling about homework.
That was just an excuse.
It was?
For what?
I really called to say, Sabrina, I think you're the prettiest girl in school.
- You do?
- Yeah.
And there's something else I wanna tell you.
- What?
- I like squid.
I like it a lot.
- Squid rocks!
- Who is this?
It's Harvey.
- Salem.
You are so neutered.
- Uh-oh.
And if the soccer team wins again tomorrow, we get to go to the playoffs.
Uh-huh.
Sabrina, did you hear what I said?
Sure, you were saying something about something?
You're not paying attention.
You keep looking around.
I was sort of expecting Harvey to show up.
So, what were you saying about school?
I wasn't saying anything about school.
I was saying if the soccer team-- Wait.
Harvey's here.
- Pretend like we're talking.
- We are talking.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Harvey.
Would you be up for a game of foosball?
Oh, actually I was just talking to Emma.
That's okay.
You go and play.
I'll finish my story later.
Good, because I really want to hear the end of it.
And the beginning.
- Okay.
- All right.
Let's foos.
I lead, 42 to 38.
Yeah, but you're going down today.
Ball up.
- Spin, spin.
- You're on the ropes.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hi, Libby.
Goooaaal!
What?
Ahem.
Goal.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Sabrina.
Oh, Harvey called for you about an hour ago.
No, he didn't.
I was just with him.
Why do I never tire of it?
So you were out with Harvey.
Did the two of you have a date?
No, we were just playing foosball.
Harvey's too oblivious to ask me out on a date.
I wish there was a way I could get Harvey to notice me.
Well, the best way to get someone's attention is to be an interesting person.
Gee, let me think.
What would make me more interesting?
I know, what if I had supernatural powers and could blow stuff up.
Careful.
A little close.
Sabrina, that is not the way to get Harvey's attention.
I know.
But it made me feel better.
Look, if you want him to notice you, don't be so available.
Get a hobby or a job.
When I was a girl, I kept bees.
I think I'll get a job.
What kind of job are you looking for?
Something to keep me busy on Friday nights.
Yeah, I don't have a boyfriend either.
Hey, look, auditions today for a "lovely magician's assistant".
That's perfect for me.
Conceited.
I'm here for the lovely magician's assistant job.
- You're really not qualified.
- Aren't I lovely?
Well, yes, Justin, you are.
But you're not a girl.
Well, the sign didn't say anything being a girl.
Would you be willing to wear sequins?
- Sure.
- Slit up to here?
- No problem.
- Yeah, well, - you're too tall.
Next.
- I'll wear flats.
Next!
He'll love you, shorty.
Um, I'm here for the magician's assistant job.
- I'm Sabrina Spellman.
- I know.
- We're in English class together.
- We are?
Yeah, I sit three chairs behind you.
Remember, one day, you dropped your pen and I picked it up and you said, "Thanks a lot".
Yeah, and then you said, "You're welcome".
Right.
Ha-ha.
Well, you seem qualified.
You're lovely.
Not too tall.
Now, do you have any experience with magic?
A little.
I prepared a trick.
Well, you're mostly there for misdirection, but go ahead.
Abracadabra.
That's like Vegas magic.
- You've got the job.
- Cool.
Hey.
You heading over to the Slicery?
I can't.
I have rehearsal.
Rehearsal?
Are you in a play?
No.
I got a job as the lovely assistant in a professional magic act.
Hey, Sabrina.
I heard you joined Magic Joel's freak show.
It's his World of Wonder.
Harvey, I'm heading over to the Slicery.
- See you there?
- Sure.
- You coming?
- Didn't you hear what I said?
I can't.
- This is where the magic happens.
- And the laundry.
Wanna see me saw my dog in half?
Your dog?
I had to practise on something before you came along.
How did you get into magic anyway?
The truth is, I thought it would make girls like me.
- And did it?
- See, that's the tragedy.
Girls hate magic.
But I still do it because magic makes me feel special.
But I guess you won't understand that.
Actually, I would.
If only magic were real.
Okay, let's start.
The first illusion you will learn is the Assistant's Revenge.
Wow.
My magic never involved such large props.
You're not a professional.
Okay, now, before I show it to you, you must swear never to reveal the amaZing and mystifying secrets of magic.
I swear I will never tell.
- The amaZing and-- - And mystifying secrets of magic.
Right.
So how does it work?
Step in.
Now, I buckle the buckles and lock the stocks.
Are you almost done?
You know, my dog never complained.
Now, I close the curtain, and I walk around the back, and presto, change-o.
Ow, my foot.
Sorry.
Now say, "Isn't he amaZing"?
Isn't he amaZing?
Thanks.
Now close the curtain again.
Open it again.
Hey, where did you go?
I disappeared.
Heh-heh.
- AmaZing.
- It's our big finale.
Now, let's talk wardrobe.
I'm thinking a velour pantsuit with a plunging neckline.
And what will you wear?
You didn't have to walk me home.
Well, after rehearsal, I always had to walk my dog too.
- Well, I'll see you.
- But before I go.
- Isn't he amaZing?
- For you.
Thanks.
See you tomorrow.
Oh!
Watch me disappear.
- Who was that?
- Joel.
He seems like a nice boy.
Yeah.
Did Harvey call?
I don't think so.
But check with the cat.
Oh, I shouldn't have.
Pick a card, any card, and I will amaZe and astound you.
You mean bother and bore me.
Hi, Harvey.
Can I sit with you?
What's wrong with your table?
It's too close to Magic Joel.
I can't believe you're working with him.
- You're working with Joel?
- I told you.
I'm his lovely assistant.
- You never pay any attention.
- Yes, I do.
You got pudding right there.
I hope this beautiful tie isn't valuable.
Well, it's my favourite tie, but-- What are you doing?
Magic, Mr. Pool.
Magic to amaZe and astound you.
Presto, change-o.
Huh.
How did you do that?
I think you made it cleaner.
Mr. Pool, I'm gonna make you an offer that you can't refuse.
So Claire comes over-- You know Claire.
- No.
- Well, she had the best story about Alice.
You know Alice.
- No.
- I'm telling the story anyway.
- See-- - Sabrina, I've got great news.
Excuse me.
Business.
Thanks to Mr. Pool, we got our first big gig.
It's tomorrow here in the cafeteria.
- All right.
The cafeteria?
- Yeah.
Do I have to wear a hair net?
Tomorrow evening, then.
That sounds great.
Okay.
Bye.
Who was that?
What's going on?
I could only hear your side of the conversation.
- That was my old college buddy.
- Galileo?
No, Ethan Boddicker.
He's coming over tomorrow night for dinner.
Mm, Zelda, you have a date.
It's not a date.
It's dinner with a colleague.
And you're welcome to join us.
I'd rather die.
But thanks.
Ta-da.
What do you think?
Do I look more interesting?
You look like some cheesy magician's assistant.
His name is Joel.
And when we perform in the cafeteria tomorrow all eyes will be on us, and Harvey will have to notice me.
What is Sabrina doing up there?
- Since when did she join a magic act?
- Behold.
The linking rings are unlinked.
Unlinked.
Still linked.
Isn't he amaZing?
AmaZingly lame.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Shh!
I can't take the pressure.
You can do this, Joel.
Move on to the tie trick.
Sir, may I have your tie so that I can perform a trick that will amaZe and astound you?
Why of course.
I love this trick.
Ha-ha.
- Now I hope this tie isn't valuable.
- Ho-ho.
CraZy.
Ha.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?
You mean "presto".
No, I messed up.
I cut the wrong part.
You ruined my tie?
Grandpa's tie?
Isn't he amaZing?
No.
- Let's go to the big finish.
- Good idea.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the big finale, I will make my lovely assistant disappear.
You know, Sabrina really found the perfect boyfriend.
She and Joel are going out?
That's what I heard.
All right, as you can see, she cannot escape.
Now.
Presto, change-o.
Ta-da.
Leave him in there.
Now, Magic Joel will disappear.
No, wait, my pants are stuck.
- What do you mean?
Oh, I blew the trick.
We'll make it work.
No, don't!
See, Magic Joel has disappeared.
- Wow.
How'd they do that?
- Magic, I guess.
Show's over.
- Joel?
Joel, where are you?
I'm right here.
- Where?
In the stocks.
What am I, invisible?
Ow, my eye.
You mean, I'm actually invisible?
- I don't know what happened.
I do.
All my hard work paid off.
My magic is real.
It's real all right.
Okay, now we have to change you back.
Why?
This is great.
I can go anywhere, I can do anything.
I am Magic Joel.
Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Where did he go?
Joel?
Joel?
Sabrina.
Hi, Harvey.
I saw the show and I have a question.
I can't tell you how the tricks are done.
No, I just wanted to know if it was true that you and Joel are going out.
Yes.
- No.
- Did someone say yes?
Yes.
No.
I'm practising my ventriloquism for the act.
But, uh, we'll talk later.
Right now, I've got to go into Mr. Pool's room.
I'm also doing mime.
How dare you?
You have no right telling Harvey we're boyfriend and girlfriend.
Why not?
- Because we're not.
I gave you a flower and you took it.
That doesn't mean anything.
Maybe not to you, but it does to me.
Look, Joel, we have a business relationship and that's it.
But Harvey doesn't even notice you.
I would worship you.
You'd be my everything.
I don't wanna be your everything.
Sabrina, what are you doing in my classroom.
I came to ask you a question.
Ask away as I staple my tie back together.
Okay, I wanted to know if you enjoyed the magic show.
Uh-- Not really.
Joel ruined my favourite tie.
There's really something not right about that boy.
- What was that?
- A gust of wind?
In this windowless prison cell?
Anyway, you know, I thought you were really polished.
My advice, lose Joel.
You don't need him.
- Mr. Pool.
- Sabrina.
Don't be so harsh.
This magic thing is a lot harder than it looks.
Well, I'd better get going.
Come on.
Grandpa?
- Hello.
- Aunt Hilda, you have to help me.
I turned Joel invisible.
Calm down.
You just need to give him a shot of visibility powder.
It's right here in the cabinet.
Can you bring it to me?
You still don't get this witch thing, do you?
Are you alone?
Pretty much.
- Got it.
- Just spray some in his face and he'll be fine.
See.
No problem.
No problem except now I have to find him.
Let's see, a 16-year-old invisible boy loose in a high school.
- Where would he go?
- Oh, no.
Keep your shirts on.
Don't change.
I smell smoke.
Run.
Panic!
Don't inhale!
Mean.
I knew you'd be here.
Look, Joel, we need to talk.
Did you come to tell me you changed your mind?
No.
What are you doing with that talcum powder?
I thought you might be chafing.
I know you probably don't see much of me right now, but you will.
I'll make you notice me, Sabrina.
You wait and see.
Ethan.
I'm so glad you came.
Zelda, you look great.
You never seem to age.
Well, let's not talk about me.
Let's talk about the search for monopoles.
- Ah.
You read my last paper.
- I couldn't put it down.
Oh, Zelda.
I'm late for my tea at the Harvard Club.
- Are you Ethan?
- Yes.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's stuck.
Why didn't you tell me Ethan was cute?
I don't think about the way he looks.
I think about the way he thinks.
I think he's cute.
Weren't you going to Harvard for some tea?
No, stupid, I was making fun of you.
Ugh.
Now I'm staying here.
Oh, how's my hair?
You have brain head.
Where have you been?
Looking for Joel.
- I haven't seen him.
- Me neither.
- Hi, Sabrina.
Can I sit here?
- Sure.
I wanna hear more about your ventriloquism.
- You talk with your stomach, right?
Harvey's a loser.
- Who said that?
- Uhh-- My stomach's grumbling.
That's it.
Where are you?
Where are you?
When I get my hands on you-- Sabrina?
Gotta go.
But you have to factor in, quarks remain forever trapped in the particles they create.
I know the feeling.
Yes, but, nowadays, all physics is subatomic physics.
I mean, between the bosons and the leptons and the quarks.
Since you took a breath, I thought I'd jump in with a new topic.
What's your favourite Bruce Willis movie?
- I don't know.
Die Hard.
- One, two, or three?
- Weren't they all the same?
- No, two is very different.
Hilda, sister, dear.
Why don't you make like an atom and split?
Fine, I can take a hint.
I'll leave you two alone to discuss your little quirks.
- It's quarks.
- I meant quirks.
- Don't talk.
Bad night.
- Know the feeling.
Thank goodness that she left.
Now we can talk about the first millisecond after the Big Bang.
- See, I think-- - Love me.
What?
Sorry, it's just that, we finally get rid of your weird sister.
And all you can talk about is the Big Bang?
I came here tonight hoping for more than science.
I wanted you to look into my eyes and see something other than rods and cones.
I love you, Zelda.
Don't you realise that?
You never said anything.
I've been playing footsie with you all night.
That was you?
I thought it was the cat.
What's the point?
This is too humiliating.
I can't let him go.
Slippery floor.
Are you okay?
- What happened?
- Slippery floor.
I'll get it.
- What are you doing down there?
Slippery floor.
And now we're going back into the dining room.
- It's time for dessert.
- Dessert?
Yes, dessert.
Oh, good, I like dessert.
Animals.
Hello, who are you?
I'm Harvey.
Is Sabrina here?
Oh, come in.
So you're Harvey.
Salem, go get Sabrina.
Why do I have to be the one?
I have a few questions.
Hey, Sabrina.
- Guess who's here?
- Very funny.
No, really.
Harvey's here.
Harvey's here?
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hi, Sabrina.
I'll leave you two alone.
Take the cat.
So, what are you doing here?
I was worried about you.
I noticed you sort of lost it at the Slicery.
- You noticed?
- Yeah, and I wondered if maybe you were mad at me?
No, I'm not mad.
Good, because I was thinking maybe  - What?
- Oh, don't make me say it again.
I swear I didn't hear you.
Do you wanna go out with me?
Like on a date?
Like a real date?
I'd love that.
Yeah.
When?
- Now?
- Let's go.
Wait, I should change first.
Hang here.
I'll be right back.
Actually, I'm gonna wait in my car.
I'm afraid your aunt will keep asking questions.
Meet you out front.
- Oh.
Hi, Sabrina.
Joel?
I totally forgot about you.
- How did you get here?
I came in with Harvey.
- Did you notice he noticed me?
Yeah.
So I guess I'm out of the running.
Joel, you never were-- Yeah, you're out of the running.
I wish you'd like me, Sabrina.
I do, Joel, just not in the way you want me to.
But I like talking magic with you.
You do?
- Yeah.
Look, are you anywhere near my face?
Actually, I'm at the piano.
- I didn't know you liked the piano.
- I thought it'd make girls like me.
- And did it?
- No, girls like guitars.
Hey, wait here.
Play.
I gotta grab something in the kitchen.
Wow, you're good.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I'm undoing.
And you know, Joel, some day some girl will appreciate all your hard work.
Maybe not in high school, but, I'm sure by late college.
Well, I better get going.
So I guess this is it.
I guess.
No, wait, we have English class together.
Oh, right, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you.
What's going on?
Who are you?
I'm Joel.
- You can see me?
- Yes.
And you're not wearing any pants.
Joel, what are you doing in here?
- Oh.
You can see me?
- No, you're invisible.
- I am?
- No!
Get out or I'm telling Coach Saffo.
Man, I thought for sure I'd done it right.
I was Magic Joel once, and I will be again.
Get out.
I hate magic.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Ethan.
Well, you're welcome.
Oh, well, yes.
Well, anytime.
I'd like that.
What are you doing now?
Oh, you're at home.
You're eating a can of tuna?
Salem, I can't believe you tricked me.
Ooh!
Zelda?
Zelda?
Ze--  What's her problem?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
And we are definitely  getting rid of this.
My cuirass.
Ugh.
Where did you find it?
You can't throw that away.
Oh, give me a break, Hilda.
You haven't used your cuirass for centuries.
Oh, I was waiting for it to come back into style.
Mm-hm.
And when were you going to use this?
Oh, my mace.
Oh, remember the good times?
Party.
Only you would be nostalgic for the Dark Ages.
I never wanna trip over this again.
My cannon.
Why would you wanna keep an instrument of destruction - in the house?
- Sentimental reasons?
We don't have room for all this junk.
Junk?
You call this junk?
Put the mace down.
All right, I'll make you a deal.
You have a week.
If you use these things, you can keep them.
If not, they go.
Fine, I accept, because it just so happens that you've selected three items that are very useful to me.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to put my cannon away.
Okay, okay, I'll clean my room.
See, I told you it was useful.
Be cool, daddy-o.
And the best way to remember it is mandible has a B,  and that stands for bottom.
But how do we remember maxilla?
It's the other one.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Before you bolt, Gordie has a very important announcement that just might change your lives.
Take it away.
- Okay, in 1581, Galileo began-- - Make it quick, Gordie.
Jumping to the end of the millennium, the Science Club will be meeting every day after school to celebrate National Science Week.
- You mean National Geek Week.
- Heh.
We hope you'll all join us.
Any questions?
Yeah.
Can we get out of here?
Sure.
Oh, sign up early, win a ham.
It's a tough room, Gordie.
Believe me, I know.
Hey, Gordie, why don't you come up with a scientific explanation for why you're such a loser?
Wesson-head.
Zit master.
Poor, Gordie.
I feel so bad for him.
Well, he needs to be more in touch with his audience.
No one knows or cares what Galileo did in 1581.
He entered the University of Pisa.
Sabrina, I didn't know you were a geek.
I'm not, I just like science.
Does that make me a geek?
No, I guess not.
I'm even thinking about going by the Science Club after school.
- Okay, now that could be a problem.
- Why?
Because this is high school.
If you show passion or enthusiasm for anything, you're doomed.
You might as well be wearing a big "kick me" sign.
Hey, Harvey.
Help us out.
- Sabrina's got a problem.
- What's up?
Well, I was thinking of joining the Science Club.
Really?
I didn't know you were a geek.
I'm not.
That's the problem.
I'm afraid everyone will think I am.
Well, they will.
I explained that we can't change the whole system just for her.
Well, why does everyone have to be stuffed in a category?
I don't get it.
Look, the cheerleaders only eat with the cheerleaders.
The geeks only eat with the geeks.
I just don't want to be labelled.
You have no choice.
You have a grace period as a new student, but pretty soon, you're gonna be stereotyped.
Well, what are you guys?
Well, I'm a quasi-jock with semi-literary aspirations and a hint of nihilism.
If only it were that simple for me.
Jenny, what are you?
I tried to be an outsider, but I didn't really fit in.
Now Libby calls me a freak, and I'm okay with that.
Well, why can't I just be me?
That's a pretty small group.
We've got spirit.
Let's hear it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I think we should take her advice and just go.
It's Spirit Week at Westbridge.
We're playing Eastbridge this weekend, and we're number one.
Whoo!
- Yeah, at turnovers and penalties.
We'll be wearing our uniforms every day this week, and leading cheers at lunch reminding you to support our team.
- Ready?
Okay.
East meets west, and we know who's the best.
Whoo!
I don't get it.
I mean, to me, that looks geeky.
How can she do that and still be so popular?
Libby's not popular.
She's powerful.
- Well, how did she get the power?
- She seiZed it.
And as long as there are people backing her up, she'll keep it.
It's all very Stalin.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
Libby's always been nice to me.
I'm going to get more Tater Tots.
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.
See you tomorrow.
We're number one.
Watch where you're going, geek.
You got my uniform wet.
- I'm sorry.
- You are so transferred.
Libby, lay off him.
It was an accident.
It's just like a freak to defend a geek.
Maybe the two of you can get weekend jobs at the carnival.
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hi.
See, she's nice.
Sabrina, I thought you were going to Science Club.
I am.
In a minute, per our previous discussion.
Got it.
Later.
Well, this is a delightful turnout.
Five, same as last year, which means none of you were killed at summer camp.
Heh-heh.
Ahem.
Okay.
See Sherman's sporting a new look.
Did you get contacts?
No, someone stole my glasses.
All right.
Well, let's begin by discussing the biggest science breakthrough in recent months.
The possible evidence of life on Mars.
What does this discovery mean to us?
Howard.
It means that the government's been covering this up for years, and that Scully and Mulder are right.
- The truth is out there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, calm down.
Calm down.
Look, how many times do we have to go over this?
The X-Files is fiction.
Scully and Mulder are played by actors.
Now, come on, don't get upset.
Hi, is this Science Club?
Did you leave something in your desk, Sabrina?
No, I was thinking of joining.
Unless you're all filled up.
Not at all.
Everyone's welcome.
Have a seat.
There's a girl in Science Club.
Don't panic.
Hey, how's it going?
Ahh-ahh-ahh.
I never knew a pickle could be used as a light bulb.
They're super versatile.
Bye, guys.
See you later.
What are you doing here so late?
Was there a meeting of the Freak Society?
- Libby, why don't you just--?
- Great having you in Science Club.
Don't forget to bring your rock tumbler tomorrow.
You went to Science Club?
That is too perfect.
You're a geek in freak's clothing.
I am not a geek.
That doesn't prove anything.
Here.
Let me help you.
See you later, geek.
Look, it still fits.
And it's great for lounging around the house.
- That doesn't count as a use.
- Why not?
No one wears metal after Labour Day.
Aunt Hilda, what's the range on your cannon?
I'll get it.
We'll find out.
Hilda, will you please sit down?
Sabrina, a cannon is not a solution for a land-based problem.
What's going on?
Libby caught me coming out of Science Club.
You went to Science Club?
Oh, that's wonderful.
No, it's not.
Now Libby thinks I'm a complete geek.
I knew this would happen.
It's Zelda's influence.
I begged you to watch TV with me so you'd be normal.
Oh, be quiet.
Hey, it's dark in here.
Now, it shouldn't bother you what Libby says.
It shouldn't but it does.
I wanna use my magic to teach Libby a lesson.
That sounds very constructive.
I'm gonna give her a snout.
Oh.
Good idea.
You need to talk to my friend Cicero.
He's an expert on these matters.
Come on, we'll look him up in the book.
- Are you coming, Hilda?
- Yes.
No, I can't.
My outfit's too heavy.
But it's very useful.
See, when you said, "Look him up in the book," I thought you meant phone book.
No, magic book.
Cicero is figure 3A.
He's one of the ancient geeks.
Oh, there he is.
Hello, Cicero.
There's a girl looking at me.
Mmm.
Don't panic.
Ask him what he'd do.
He's very knowledgeable.
His was the first recorded wedgie.
Hey, Cicero.
I'm Sabrina, and I have a question.
Ask away, but make it quick.
If the centurions catch me here, it's a guaranteed swirly in the aqueduct.
Okay.
See, there's this girl in my school, and she keeps calling me a geek, and I really don't like it.
I suggest that you ignore her.
Okay?
Bye-bye.
No, wait.
I can't ignore her.
No one can ignore her.
You've gotta help.
Well, there are two ways to teach her a lesson.
The first is to just give her a snout.
- I knew it.
- What's the second?
Give her a taste of her own medicine.
Turn her into a geek.
She'll see how it feels, and she'll learn that it's what's inside that really counts.
But how can I do that?
A simple spell.
Just point.
Like this?
Well, actually, you just have to point.
My glasses were slipping.
Heh.
Thanks, Cicero.
You've been a big help.
Nice move, four eyes.
- Hi, Libby.
- Are you okay?
Oh, my eyeballs just started itching.
It must be my contacts.
I'll be right back.
Libby wears contacts?
Much better.
- Oh, my God.
- What happened to you?
You look totally weird.
I took my contacts out.
But what did you do to your hair?
Well, I ran my fingers through it a couple times.
Doesn't it look shiny?
- More like greasy.
- What's with the uniform?
I was cold, so I pulled up my socks.
- It's function over fashion.
- Since when?
The bell.
We'll be late for class.
We're always late for class.
That's what we do.
But we might miss something that's on a test.
Come on.
What are you looking at?
Hey, Harvey, Jenny, over here.
- You look happy.
- What's going on?
Oh, just a new world order, and butterscotch pudding.
Oh, boy, butterscotch pudding.
Hair check.
Matt Sabetti's heading this way.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.
Huhuhuhuh.
What was that noise?
My asthma just kicked in.
I need my inhaler.
Get it later.
It's time to cheer.
We've got spirit.
- Let's hear it.
- Hear it.
Ready.
Okay.
East meets west, and we know who's the-- Ow!
You poked me in the eye.
Emergency huddle.
Not you.
You're huddling without me?
You can't huddle without me.
You can't exclude me.
We just did.
You're sitting out Spirit Week, Chessler.
You're a threat to the whole team.
But where will I go?
- Who will I sit with?
- I'm sure you'd fit in over there.
I don't think so.
Watch where you're going, geek.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Just because I wear glasses and have asthma and wanna do well in school, does not mean that I'm a--  Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh.
There's something different about Libby.
Did she change her hair?
Ready?
Okay.
It's Spirit Week, and Libby's now a geek.
People are laughing at Libby.
I know it's mean to say this, but yes.
Hey, she's always been nice to me.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Well, whatever Libby's going through doesn't involve you.
Who said it did?
It's not like I feel responsible.
I'm just a really empathetic person.
Gotta go.
Libby?
I know you're in here.
I can hear you wheeZing.
- What do you want?
- I just came to talk.
Don't you mean gloat?
I can talk and gloat at the same time.
Look, I thought you might need a friend.
Why?
Because all my other friends dumped me?
Don't they realise that geeks have needs and wants and feelings?
If you trip us, do we not fall?
If you prick us, do we not scream and pass out?
- And what does that teach you?
- To hate cheerleaders.
No, it teaches you that it's what's inside that counts.
- That's what I've learned?
- Man, I hope so.
Wait a minute, let me process this.
It's what's inside that counts.
So no matter how I look or dress, I'm still me.
I'm still Libby Chessler.
Heh.
This is very exciting.
But not over-exciting.
Let's go back to lunch.
- Can I sit here?
Huh?
Relax, I'm one of you.
What's going on?
Libby's sitting with the geeks.
See, I told you she was nice.
What did you say to her?
I just told her to be herself.
Let's talk about power.
How to get it.
How to keep it.
Hey, did you see Xena: Warrior Princess last night?
Quiet, this is important.
- Are you catching the bus?
- No, I'm going to Science Club.
Are you sure you wanna broadcast that?
Yeah, I do.
Today the halls are safe for geeks.
But you can't protect them from themselves.
Hey, I brought my rock tumbler.
May we help you?
What are you doing here?
I'm the new president.
And by the way, membership is closed.
Science Club is now limited to six people.
That's how many can fit in the space shuttle.
You can't do that.
Where's Mr. Pool?
I sent him for Tang and Fig Newtons.
Besides, you don't belong here.
You're not a total geek.
Is she, guys?
No, she's not.
No.
Yeah, you never sat with us at lunch.
And what's your eyesight, twenty-twenty?
Stab me in the back with a protractor, why don't you?
I can't believe you guys are siding with Libby.
She made fun of you all the time.
Yeah, but now she's our leader.
She's not my leader.
What did you say, Gordie?
I said, you're not my leader.
You're pushy and bossy, and if Sabrina goes, I go.
- That was very brave of you, Gordie.
- Don't talk.
Run.
Look, Salem.
I'm tenderiZing the beef with my mace.
It's a deadly weapon and a handy kitchen tool.
Oh, please.
We've all seen the infomercial.
Hi, Sabrina.
I just had a big, stinky day.
Aunt Hilda, my magic never works the way I want it to.
Would it make you feel better to pound some beef?
Maybe.
You'll be happy to know I got kicked out of the Science Club.
How come?
Because Libby says I'm not a total geek.
I thought you were upset yesterday because she said you were one.
- Yes.
- There is no pleasing you.
All right, you're a little too good at that.
Heh.
- Let's take a break.
- Hey, can I lick the mace?
Oh, all right, but be careful.
Mmm.
Oh!
But it's worth it.
You know, the point was to teach Libby that it's what's inside that counts.
But I just forgot that inside, she's just a manipulative conniving dictator.
So are you reconsidering the snout?
No.
I'm just gonna turn her back to normal.
I think I need to pound some more beef.
Hey, Cee Cee.
Nice uniform.
What does the W stand for?
- Where's my brain?
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, you geeks Hey, look at me.
I'm Jill, and I wash my hair every day.
Shields down.
Direct hit.
Fire again.
Hey, how many cheerleaders does it take to screw in a pickle?
I don't get it.
You wouldn't.
Did you see that?
The cheerleaders are being teased by the geeks.
The revolution is upon us.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
That's funny.
My eyeballs stopped itching.
So anyway, I checked out the Weird Al Yankovic website, and I think I'm gonna link it to my home page.
Hey, Libby.
Can I speak with you a moment?
Make it quick.
I don't wanna be seen talking with you.
Okay.
Well, I was just wondering if you tried doing any cheers lately?
I bet you could.
Any seal can clap.
I am a higher life form.
I never would have guessed it, but I think Libby really likes being a geek.
Doesn't surprise me.
Libby doesn't care what group she's in.
As long as she can exclude people, she's happy.
Jenny, I want you to come to Science Club with me.
Sorry, I'm not into organiZed science.
- Maybe I can convince you.
- I doubt it.
Ow.
I hope I didn't suffer a haematoma.
Save it for Club.
Come on.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- Wanna come to Science Club?
- No way.
Weird.
Suddenly I wish I had every episode of Mystery Science Theatre on tape.
Hurry up.
We're gonna be late.
Calm down.
I'll be right back.
Stay here.
For the good of mankind.
I can't look.
And the handwriting recognition on my Newton turned it into: "Are you afraid of the dork"?
I'll get it.
- Hello, Mr. Pool.
- Sabrina?
Let's talk Philip K. Dick.
- Hey, you can't come in here.
- Well, of course she can.
And I brought some friends with me.
Come on, guys.
Hello.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi.
You're all here for Science Club?
Yeah, science rocks.
Well, welcome, welcome.
Oh, what a happy day.
I've touched you kids.
I'm gonna save the space programme.
Wait one nanosecond.
Science Club was supposed to be exclusively for geeks.
It is, but now we're all geeks.
Hey, Science Club is for everyone.
Are you kidding?
This isn't a club.
It's just a bunch of people with shared interests hanging out together.
Well, not me.
I'm going home to wash my hair.
Wait, don't leave.
You'll miss out.
The rest of us are gonna play with really strong magnets.
Look at you.
Geeked to the gills.
This is awful.
I blame myself.
No, wait.
I blame Zelda.
This is all your fault.
My fault?
Oh, Sabrina, you look adorable, and so smart.
I feel smart.
And you know what?
I learned something.
No matter what we're labelled, Libby will always be Libby, and I will always be me.
You had to become a geek to figure that out?
Well, it's actually rather complex.
I just put it in layman's terms for you.
I have to do that all the time.
Oh, so, what are you saying, you dumb things down for me?
- Well, C, colon, backslash: Duh.
- Would you speak English?
- How come I always figure out the tip?
- Without technology you wouldn't-- I am going to take a shower.
--VCR.
None of it would exist without science.
Here, let me help.
Wait a minute.
Here you go, Gordie.
You're setting me up, aren't you?
Oh, so now we're helping geeks?
I just don't feel like making fun of him anymore.
You know, geeks are people too.
But if we can't make fun of geeks, who will we make fun of?
Hi, Sabrina.
Super-freak.
I just thought you should know the kid next door is chucking water balloons at our house.
Mm, I know.
Hilda already went out there.
She said she was gonna do something about it.
He's such a little creep.
He's gonna break my window.
Arr!
Prepare to be boarded, Timmy.
What was that?
Yes.
I used my cannon.
It stays.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Okay, here goes.
Not again.
- You're getting better.
- I stink.
Yeah, but you're getting better.
This time just try to hit it just a little higher, a little straighter, and a little further.
Or any one of those.
It's these stupid birdies.
Why won't they fly?
Sorry.
Do I get any points for that?
Feeling groovy.
Far out.
To review, bone is comprised primarily of what?
Come on, it's written on the board behind me.
Calcium.
I just told you kids five minutes ago.
Don't you listen?
- That you heard.
Okay, for homework tonight read chapter 15.
And reread chapter 14.
It's for your own good.
Mr. Pool, can I say something?
- What is it, Sabrina?
- A bone's hardness is derived mainly from calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with small amounts of fluorides, sulphates and chlorides.
You listened to what I said?
Why didn't you raise your hand?
It's never enough for you, is it?
Wah!
Your point?
I just found out they're offering kung fu as a P.E. elective.
Isn't that cool?
What about badminton?
Badminton won't register these as lethal weapons.
Well, you said I should register my racket.
Well, you've got to learn to hold on to that thing.
It's hard.
I'm not a jock like you.
I mean, you probably have a ton of these.
Eighteen is not a ton.
And besides, it's no big deal.
Trophies are just a symbol of superiority and greatness.
Oh, and who'd want one of those?
I think this semester I'm gonna take basketball.
That way I can get some reading done on the bench.
Actually, I was hoping you'd take kung fu with me.
Really?
That'd be fun.
- Hai-ya!
- Oh!
Sorry.
I think that deserves a round of applause.
I said--  Hilda, we're on our last vase.
But I'm rehearsing for the biggest audition of my career.
I need all the encouragement I can get.
There.
Now take a break.
You've been practising that same piece since MoZart wrote it.
But no one plays it better than Gustav Von Hegel.
He's the one I have to beat.
- Hi, aunties, I'm home.
Hi.
Wow.
Pretty roses, and nice arrangement.
They're from my loyal, but imaginary fans.
Did you have fun in school?
Yeah, Harvey asked me to take kung fu with him.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
I just hope I don't maim him.
Would one of you sign my permission slip?
You do it.
I have to protect my hands.
What are we doing?
I think this music is supposed to psych us up, but it's not exactly "We Will Rock You".
Ha!
Good day, students.
Mr. Pool?
I am your Si Fu and I'll be teaching you P.E. So if you'll all please rise to your feet.
I can't believe Mr. Pool knows kung fu.
I can.
Think about how much he was probably beat up as a kid.
Now, we'll begin our class with the customary bow, to show respect for your Si Fu.
Come on, it's tradition.
Now, we'll begin with some breathing exercises designed to help you locate your chi.
And, no, that's not something you left in your locker.
No, chi is inner strength.
So everybody breathe in.
- And out.
- Wow, this is easier than badminton.
Not that badminton's easy.
Okay, I'm gonna need a volunteer.
So can I see a show of hands?
No one.
JeeZ, I might as well be teaching biology.
Mr. Pool, - I'll give ageless wisdom a shot.
- Thank you.
Now, together we're gonna demonstrate the philosophy of the river and the rock.
- Which do you wanna be?
- The rock, obviously.
Nothing can move a rock.
Western thinking.
Okay, Sabrina will be the rock.
I'll be the river.
We'll see which one is stronger.
We bow.
And go.
- You tripped me.
- The river tripped you.
The river always beats the rock.
Because the river has great inner strength.
Oh, maybe the rock has great inner strength too, - but didn't have a chance to use it.
- The rock is slow and heavy.
The river's all wet.
- The rock wants a rematch.
- The river's game.
What are they talking about?
We bow.
- And go.
Ah-ha.
Very smart.
You see--  - The rock wins.
- And that's the proper way to fall.
- All right, two out of three.
- You've got it.
I didn't know Sabrina could do that.
No mÃ¡s.
No mÃ¡s.
Yeah!
Open the door, Sabrina.
My hands.
It's Mr. Pool.
Duck.
The reason I'm here is, well, today in kung fu-- Actually, I think it's better if you hear this from me.
Today in kung fu, I kicked Mr. Pool's butt.
Sabrina, you didn't!
I've never seen such natural gifts, which is why I'm here.
Sabrina, are you at all interested in glory?
Now, I could go for some glory.
There's a kung fu competition in Boston next week.
I think you have the potential to make some waves in the river.
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?
She's had one class in a public school.
She can't be ready for competition.
But I am.
I can prove it.
Wanna see me flip Mr. Pool again?
Yes.
- No, that won't be necessary.
So can she go?
Well, it's up to her.
- Okay.
- Great.
I'll just file the necessary paperwork, then swing by my HMO for a quick CAT scan to make sure this ringing in my ears is no big deal.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hopefully without all these spots.
See you.
Woo-hoo!
I think I found my sport.
Yes!
I'm a jock.
Pretend you didn't see that.
She seems happy.
It's all a little too easy.
I smell a rat.
Ooh, a rat.
Oh, wait.
I had rat for lunch.
Cute.
- And deadly.
You knocked?
Can we come in?
All doors are open on the path to enlightenment.
We'll take that as a yes.
Sabrina, we have a question.
Mr. Pool spoke of your "natural gifts".
And we wondering, are they truly natural, or supernatural?
You mean, did I use my magic?
Bear in mind, we're not accusing, we're just asking.
- Well, I did.
- How could you?
What were you thinking?
I thought you wanted me to use my magic more.
We do, but not when you compete against mortals.
Then your magic gives you an unfair advantage.
That's why I've been practising so hard.
I want to win first chair not because I'm a witch, but because I have talent.
But I don't have talent.
In fact, I stink at sports.
Well, have you tried something easy, like badminton?
Look, are you saying I can't do this?
We're saying let your conscience be your guide.
Use your moral compass.
Or you can borrow mine.
Here.
Try it.
How accurate is this?
We'll leave you alone to think about that.
- Zelda, the door.
- Oh, stop it.
I saw you cracking walnuts earlier.
"Let your conscience be your guide".
I hate when they say that.
Now I have no idea what to do.
You should consider the pros and cons.
Okay, I use my magic, I win.
Without it, I lose.
Win, lose, win, lose.
I'm going with win.
Wow, some of these guys are really big.
Yeah.
I wish we had trained more.
You know, beyond the breathing exercises.
I'll be fine, Mr. Pool.
Don't forget.
I've got my inner strength.
And don't forget, I have a permission slip signed by your legal guardians.
I know him.
That's the bad guy from the movie Drangonkiller.
His name is Tai Wai Tse.
And he's a great fighter with a colossal chi.
Last time I saw him he was impaled on punji sticks.
He looks good.
Will I be doing combat with him?
Only if you win all three of your matches.
So let's just focus and concentrate on your first opponent.
Right.
Focus and concentrate.
Focus and concentrate.
Focus and concentrate.
- Oh, Harvey, you made it.
I couldn't miss your big match.
I mean, it's amaZing all the progress you've made in the past two days.
Oh, well, Mr. Pool's a great teacher.
Well, listen, there's something I wanna say to you that's something I always wished my dad would say to me before a game.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, you're still a winner to me.
Thanks.
Now excuse me, Harvey, I've got to go kick some butt.
"So, Tigerbalm, you killed my brother, you killed my father and now you've you come for me.
But you will not succeed".
What are you talking about?
That's what the guy said at the end of Dragonkiller before he tossed you on the punji sticks.
Oh, yeah, punji sticks.
That was fun.
Are you ready to get this over with?
Aren't we supposed to spar verbally first?
Only in the movies.
Now it is time for me to defeat you.
You can try.
But you will not succeed.
If the vendor comes by, order me an Icee.
The winner is Sabrina.
Way to go.
I eat lunch with her.
A trophy?
I have a trophy.
Is this real gold?
It's such a great trophy, Salem.
Look, it says "First," it's got that little gold guy on top.
It really is the best trophy.
And look.
It comes up past my knee.
And you know what else occurs to me?
Is it about the trophy?
I just realised I can retire now.
Because I'm not greedy.
I just wanted one trophy and now I've got one.
I'm glad it all worked out.
Now go to sleep.
Okay.
Trophy, trophy, trophy.
I'm done.
Cheater.
- What?
Cheater.
Salem, what did you say?
I didn't say anything.
It came from over there.
- Over where?
- By your trophy.
- My trophy?
- Cheater.
My trophy.
- Did you say something?
- Pbbt!
Cheater.
- What is this about?
- You didn't deserve to win me.
You used magic.
You're a cheater.
Hey, lay off, you gold-plated mantel warmer.
Don't start with me, tabby.
I'll take you out with a single blow.
- I'll mess you up.
- You're going down.
Stop it.
Both of you.
Now, can we discuss this in the morning?
Sure we can discuss this in the morning.
But I'm not gonna shut up tonight.
Cheater, cheater.
Cheater, cheater, cheater.
- You'll wake up my aunts.
- They're asleep?
- Yes.
Cheater!
Cheater!
- You leave me no alternative.
- Cheater.
Cheater.
Cheater.
Cheater.
Ooh, now you're making me mad.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
What's all the noise?
- Is everything okay?
- No.
My trophy won't shut up.
Well, just tell it to-- Huh?
He keeps calling me names.
I don't know what's happening.
I take it you decided to compete in kung fu.
Yeah, and she won.
Cheater.
Well, that explains it.
The trophy is speaking your guilty conscience.
You told me to decide for myself, and I did.
And you decided wrong.
How do I get it to stop yapping?
Well, you can put a teeny-weeny sock in his mouth, or you could clear your conscience.
I have a better idea.
What?
That's where I was planning to keep it.
Here's our champion, huh?
Sabrina, I bow to your greatness.
- Please, don't.
- No, you deserve it.
Not many people could compete the way you did.
That's true.
So where's your trophy?
At home in the freeZer, with all our other valuables.
Don't you want to show it off in the trophy case?
No.
It's really not that great a trophy.
Are you kidding?
It comes up to your knee.
Besides, that trophy says you're the best.
Well, that may be what it says to you, but it's not what it says to me.
- Hilda.
- Gustov.
How nice to see you.
What are you doing here?
Auditioning for first chair, same as you.
No, not same as me.
You never play same as me.
Hello, Stradi.
You have a Stradivarius?
Yes.
That other job I beat you out for paid me well enough to buy it.
And the case.
Well, you're not gonna beat me this time.
Oh, no?
I think I will.
I think you are fine for weddings, bar mitZvahs, hoedowns, but being first chair requires skill, talent, me.
You know, I've got my fans too.
And they think this is my year.
Give it up.
There's nothing you can do.
Oh, yes, there is.
What?
Are you gonna cry like a little baby?
- "Boo-hoo, choose me".
- No.
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm going to go in there and play like I've never played before.
That would be an excellent idea.
I take it the audition didn't go well?
Gustav got first.
I got second.
I'm so sorry.
- Should I notify the weather service?
- No.
There.
Now it's out of my system.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hi.
You'll be happy to know, I'm ready to do the right thing.
Oh, Sabrina, that's great.
I did the right thing.
Oh, yeah, your audition.
How did it go?
They did the right thing.
So did you get first chair?
No.
I got second chair.
But I tried my hardest, and second chair is even better than first chair when you think about it over and over until words lose all meaning.
You can drop it, Aunt Hilda.
I've already decided to give back the trophy.
TROPHY : Cheater.
Cheater.
Okay, I was gonna run you under hot water.
But now, you get nothing.
I am tired of playing the ninja assassin.
I know, Marty.
Look, I just want to play the dad on a phone commercial.
Yeah, work on it.
Look, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door.
Love you, ciao.
Hi, Tai.
You probably don't remember me.
Yeah, like so many little blond girls kick my butt that I can't keep them straight.
You're Sabrina, right?
Yeah, I came to bring you this.
I think you should have it.
You won it, you keep it.
You keep it.
It'll be happier here.
Look.
See, he's surrounded by his little friends.
Okay, gotta go.
Wait, wait.
I can't keep this trophy.
Even though it comes past my knee, I haven't earned it.
It'd be meaningless.
It's more annoying than meaningless.
I could only accept it if I won it honourably in a rematch.
You mean I'd have to fight you again?
But we already did that.
Okay, how about this, we play foosball?
There is no honour in foosball.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Mr. Pool, can we talk?
Oh, of course my little Dragonkiller killer.
I thought you should know I agreed to a rematch with Tai Wai Tse.
That's fantastic.
I'm thrilled.
Although, all future bookings should go through me.
That won't happen again.
Now, here's the thing.
I need you to train me.
Oh, sure.
We'll do our usual breathing exercises.
No, I mean really train me.
Like, teach me to fight.
- But you know how to fight.
- I forgot.
I lost my chi.
Where's my chi?
Have you seen it?
Sabrina, look, it's right there inside you.
Now, you've got the stuff.
I don't know what made you lose your confidence, but I suggest you get it back really soon.
Okay, you're right.
I just need to focus and concentrate.
Focus and concentrate, focus and concentrate.
- Oh, sorry.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
There's Tai Wai Tse.
Does he look flabbier to you?
Not really.
Go get him, Sabrina.
So, Sabrina, we meet again.
Yeah.
Hi.
Nice shirt.
Okay.
Guess upper body isn't my strength.
Let's go for legs.
Can you come over here?
I have to ask you a question.
No way.
It's a trick.
You'll pull me down.
No, I won't.
I just wanna ask if there's an honourable way to beg for mercy.
It's not time for mercy yet.
How about now?
You approached this match with honour, Sabrina.
Now close your eyes and we'll end it that way.
Your knee-high trophy is mine.
Sabrina, are you okay?
I think I bruised my chi, but my conscience is clear.
Excuse me.
There's something I have to do.
So I guess this is it.
I'm giving you to your rightful owner.
I'm not a cheater anymore.
I know.
Pbbt!
Loser.
I'm not gonna miss you one bit.
Hey, Aunt Zelda.
Look.
Oh, you did the right thing.
How do you feel?
Sore, but good.
Where's Aunt Hilda?
I want to tell her the news.
She's at the symphony.
It's her first night playing second chair.
I wish she had beaten that guy.
Me too.
But what can you do?
- Can we come in?
- Sure.
We've got something for you.
- Is that a trophy?
- And it comes up to your ankle.
"World's Greatest Niece".
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Oh, well you earned it.
Fair and square.
- Hey, what's that around your neck?
- Nothing.
It's a gold medal, isn't it?
Where did you get that?
Kerri Strug gave it to me.
Homework time.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hello?
Cousin Monty.
How nice to hear from you.
Here's Zelda.
Hi, Monty.
Well, yes, we'll be home for Christmas Eve.
Why?
You're kidding.
I was sure you'd have other plans.
Of course, you're always welcome.
We'll spend the holidays together.
No trouble.
We'll see you tomorrow at 7, then.
You invited Cousin Monty?
How could you?
He's family.
He shouldn't be alone for the holidays.
But he's so annoying.
Well, you should have said something.
Smile when you say that, partner.
- Ooh, a hot mulled cider.
- You want some?
Let me mull it over.
Every Christmas that gets a little less funny.
I'll take more eggnog.
This time, don't skimp on the Christmas cheer.
Oh, no liquor for you, Salem.
Your little kitty liver can't handle it.
Give me a break.
You know I always get depressed this time of year.
- Why?
- Well, for one thing, I'm a cat.
Come on, just try and have a little Christmas spirit.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, bah Now that's enough.
You don't have to enjoy the Christmas season, but you will not ruin it for the rest of us.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly Stupid cat.
- Salem, were you in my closet again?
- Yeah, so?
You ruined my Christmas sweater.
- Yeah, so?
- It meant a lot to me.
You shouldn't have hidden your diary under it.
- You were reading my diary?
- It's dull.
I told you 1,000 times, stay out of my stuff!
When I was a teenager-- - Stop it, you two.
It's Christmas Eve, and I don't want any more arguing.
Salem, you owe Sabrina an apology.
- Now.
- I'm thinking of how to word it.
Try, "I'm sorry".
Somehow that just doesn't feel right.
Forget it.
I don't have time for this.
I've got to meet Harvey at the Slicery.
But now I've got to change, thanks to you.
Since you thanked me, can I ask a favour?
Excuse me, cat?
You want a favour?
Yeah, can I tag along to the Slicery?
I've got a touch of cabin fever and I'd really like to-- Are you insane?
I wouldn't bring you to the Slicery if you were the last person-slash-cat on Earth.
Man, what's her problem?
You are so self-centred.
Even for a cat.
How about we leave you alone to think about what you've done.
And when Sabrina comes back downstairs, I suggest you apologise.
Say you're sorry.
Hmm.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't think of this sooner.
Oh, Harvey's gift.
- Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.
It's good for me to read Sports Illustrated.
I'll have something to talk about with my dad during church.
Anyway, here.
This is for you.
- Thanks, it was so sweet of you-- - Open it.
Please.
I'm kind of nervous.
- About what?
- About whether you'll like it or not.
I love it.
It's beautiful.
A silver necklace.
Technically, it's a choker.
I just learned that.
- Help me put it on?
- I hope it's the right siZe.
My sister helped me pick it out and she's got a neck like a linebacker.
Your dad must be really proud.
- It looks pretty.
- Oh, hey.
I've got something for you.
Salem?
How did he get to this?
My cat ruins everything.
Hey, no big deal.
I was gonna rip it open anyway.
Here.
Wow, a scarf.
It's great.
- I made it myself.
- You knit?
I made it myself.
- It fits.
- We both got each other neck stuff.
Number 17, your piZZa's ready.
That's us.
I ordered the Christmas piZZa.
- With the red and green peppers?
- Yep.
So this is the Slicery.
Man, what a dump.
Hey, look, parsley.
I think it's mistletoe.
Mistletoe?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Give her a Christmas kiss.
I bet she'd like that.
Wouldn't you?
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
- What was that?
- Salem, I can't believe this.
Who let a cat in here?
Sabrina, isn't that yours?
He must have crawled into my bag.
Oh, this cat belongs to you?
We don't allow animals in here.
You let a mouse in.
There's no mouse.
I saw no mouse.
Now get that dirty cat out of here.
No, not through the front door.
Cats are a health haZard.
Take him through the kitchen.
And don't come back.
Who'd want to?
Dirty cat?
I was the cleanest thing in the whole place.
You are in so much trouble.
I have never been so mad - at you in my entire life.
- What's the big deal?
There was a mouse.
I chased it.
- End of story.
- Not end of story.
You got me kicked out of the Slicery.
It's the one place I had privacy.
Don't talk to me about privacy.
I'm the one who has to relieve himself in a box in the kitchen.
You know how hard it is to get that faraway stare going?
Like anyone's watching.
Hey, Sabrina, are you back there?
Harvey's coming.
Now, be quiet.
Oh, meow.
I mean it.
I got the piZZa to go.
Are you okay?
No, I'm getting attitude from my cat.
Sometimes I wish I could just argh him.
Oh, come on.
Cut him some slack.
After all, his brain's only the siZe of a walnut.
?
That's an excellent point, Harvey.
Sometimes I forget he is just a stupid cat.
A stupid, stupid, stupid cat.
- I feel better.
- Good.
- Come on, I'll walk you home.
- Okay, just give me a sec.
- Salem, get in the bag.
Get in the bag!
- No.
Get lost, biped.
I don't need you to get home.
Fine.
Stay in the trash for all I care.
- Let's go.
- You know that's cute, talking to your cat.
Yeah, if only I could get him to listen.
No, no.
You can't make me.
We agreed.
You promised you would do the cooking this year.
But you're a much better cook than I am.
I have prepared Christmas dinner for the last 280 years.
It's your turn.
- But-- - Hilda, you're not getting out of it.
I hate cooking.
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Monty!
Monty.
Glad tidings to all.
I come bearing figgy pudding.
Oh.
And you're familiar with my familiar.
Merry Christmas, Newt.
Oh, I forgot my fruitcake.
You didn't mention you were bringing an extra mouth.
Oh, Hilda, how much can one little newt eat?
Besides, any friend of Monty's is welcome in this house.
I'm delighted to hear you say that, Zelly, because I have something to declare.
Come forth, my lovely.
Ladies, meet Lulu.
Happy holidays.
Oh, it's awful crowded in there.
Do you mind if I stretch?
- Isn't she a pip?
- Oh, she's pippy all right.
Of course, she doesn't have a nickel to her name.
I wish I could have married money like Cole Porter, but, Lord help me, I'm attracted to this.
Hey.
Man, I'm glad I didn't invite Harvey in.
Sabrina, you're just in time to meet our guests.
- This is Monty.
- Charmed.
- And Lulu.
- Hi.
I can roll my tongue.
Oh, and this is Salem's oldest and dearest friend, Newt.
Oldest and dearest friend, my tail.
You know, it's Salem's fault that I'm a salamander in the first place.
Newt was into Salem's scheme for world domination.
Way into it.
Yeah, he promised me Denmark.
So where is the dear boy?
Out catting around?
Catting.
Last time I saw him, he was in a dumpster behind the Slicery.
He said he'd find his own way home.
You left him outside?
- You know he's a house pet.
- He'll be fine.
Salem's the only cat in town that can call a cab.
Said Barnacle Bill the Sailor Oh, that's all the sea shanties I know.
They must be plenty worried about me now.
Time to head home.
Kitty, kitty, are you all right?
You don't look hurt.
But I'll just take you home to make sure.
Zelda, you've really outdone yourself.
Delicious hot mulled cider.
It tickles.
- Did you hear something?
- Oh, I hope it's Salem.
Tell him I'm still mad at him.
- Salem?
Hey, lady!
No, it's just a bunch of kids throwing snowballs.
Watch out for the ice.
Where is Salem, anyway?
Probably out having the time of his life.
I can hear your heart, kitty.
You're going to live.
Rex, wash up.
It's time for dinner.
- What's that?
- A kitty.
I can see it's a kitty, but where'd he come from.
He followed me home.
Can I keep him?
Oh, well, you know how your mom is about pets, and we still don't know where the snake is.
- I won't lose the kitty.
- Hm.
Please, it would be the best Christmas present ever.
Keep him in your room.
I'll talk to your mom about it tomorrow.
Right now she has her family over, and it's not a good time.
Come on.
Let's get ready for dinner.
- Guess what I named him.
- What?
- Stinky.
- Okay.
And I've got some names for you too, kid.
Ooh, phone.
Isn't he marvellous?
- I just can't keep my feet off of him.
- You seem like you're really in love.
Well, she's just so darn flexible.
I still think we should have waited for Salem.
It's not like him to miss a meal.
I hope he's okay.
It's getting cold out.
He has a fur coat.
Can we change the subject?
Let's talk about Monty.
I wanna know everything about you.
- I was born in a lighthouse--  - I'll get it.
- A lighthouse?
In Nebraska?
It explains the hat.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Salem.
Need a ride?
Help me.
I've been kidnapped.
And I'm wearing a nightgown.
- What?
Where are you?
- Some kid's room.
He knocked me out behind the Slicery.
I came to just in time to see his house.
It has a white door and a Christmas wreath.
Is this a joke?
- Hello?
Who is this?
- Sabrina.
Do you have my cat?
Sorry, Sabrina.
He's my cat now.
- Wait.
Don't hang up.
- Phone's not for Stinky.
Now I have to go eat dinner.
But later, I'm gonna give you a nice long bath so you'll be all clean for Santa.
What have I done?
What have I done?
Salem's been kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
By who?
A little boy with a lisp.
What does he want?
I'll pay whatever it is.
He doesn't want money.
He wants Salem.
But remember, I offered.
We have to get him back.
Can we use magic to find him?
You can't file a missing witches report for 24 hours.
- Oh, but we can't wait a whole day.
- Calm down.
We can look for Salem the mortal way.
What do we know?
Okay, he's trapped in a house with a white door and a Christmas wreath.
Which in July would have helped us, but right now we need more information.
He's also wearing a nightgown.
Interesting but irrelevant.
We should return to the scene of the crime.
The alley behind the Slicery.
Let's go.
We'll go with you.
- I'm stuck.
- Plan B, we'll hold down the fort.
God rest ye merry, gentlemen Let nothing you dismay I'm so alone.
Hello?
They're all closed up for the holidays.
Where's Hilda?
No Salem, but I found a lot of crusts.
What's with people?
It's my favourite part.
We've got trash and more trash.
We have nothing.
He's our only eyewitness and he's no help.
Well, we haven't asked.
Hey, what's going on?
Coolio, cool.
We need some information.
Oh, well, as you can see, that's right up my alley.
We were wondering if you'd seen our cat.
Well, hanging out in this alley, I see a lot of cats, so you gotta be more specific.
Well, he's a black cat, about this tall.
- And he talks.
- Oh, the talking cat.
I remember him.
He was singing sea shanties.
Then he got hit by a bike.
He got hit?
Was he hurt?
No, but the kid took him home just to be sure.
- Which why did they go?
- Down that way, and to the left.
- Did you see anything else?
- The kid's wheels had a vanity plate.
His name was Rex.
That's Latin for "king".
Anyway, I gotta get back to work.
So are you guys coming to the concert?
It's sold out.
Can you get me tickets?
Sorry.
I'm just an alley poster.
Try a billboard.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Mr. Coolio.
Word to your mother.
Right.
Okay, we're on his tail.
Now we know who, when, how, and sort of where.
Let's start knocking on doors.
Salem?
I need a plan.
What would MacGyver do?
You know, if he were a cat.
It's a craZy idea, but it just might-- No, that won't work.
But that might.
Bye, Grandma, see you next year.
Stinky?
Where are you, Stinky?
- Help.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad!
- Yes.
Oh, no, Stinky's gone.
Oh, yay.
Stinky's back!
- I told you to keep him in your room.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
It'll never happen again.
I'll make sure of that.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was looking for my cat, and I was wondering if you'd seen it.
The cat?
No.
My mom won't let me have a pet.
Okay.
Thanks anyway.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- You have a lisp.
- So?
- What's your name?
- None of your business.
Rex, who's at the door?
Rex, you have my cat.
Give me back my cat.
- What's going on here?
- Your son has my cat.
No, I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
My little Rex doesn't have a cat.
- See?
- Look, I know he's lying.
Salem?
- Salem?
- Sabrina?
- Salem.
- Sabrina!
- Can I just check his room?
- That's enough.
Now, don't make me call my husband.
Go away.
And Merry Christmas.
It's all my fault.
I never should have left him alone.
Oh, he'll be okay.
Even before he was a cat, Salem always landed on his feet.
But if it weren't for me, he'd be home.
I could kick myself.
I can kick myself.
Can we focus?
Okay, we have five witches and a newt, - we should be able to do something.
- I've got it.
We all hide inside a giant wooden horse.
That worked so well the last time.
What if I use my magic to pop into the house and grab Salem?
Too risky.
If the boy sees you, you're caught.
How will you explain it?
I wouldn't.
I'd just knock him down and run out as fast as I could.
Oh, good plan.
Bad plan.
Well, maybe I just got a better one.
Who is that?
Santa.
Is that you?
Ho-ho-ho.
The other kids said that you didn't exist, but I knew you did.
I knew it.
Yeah, yeah, now listen, Rex.
We need to talk.
Did you bring me presents?
Yeah, I did.
Ho-ho-ho.
I brought you a, uhspatula.
And this Neil Diamond box set.
Neil Diamond?
Didn't you get my fax?
You'll get more presents tomorrow.
Right now, I need to talk to your cat.
- What do you want with Stinky?
- Well, see, you got the wrong cat.
Actually, he belongs to a sweet little blond girl, who misses him very much.
Tough luck.
Well, if that's how you feel about it, then let me just give Stinky his Christmas present.
It's in the bag.
In the bag, hint, hint, hint.
Okay, lot of houses to hit.
See you next year.
- Santa, you have my cat.
- Gotta go.
- You can't steal my cat.
- Watch me.
Santa's stealing my cat.
Santa's stealing my cat!
Rex, Rex, what's going on?
Santa stole my cat.
Oh, honey, no, no, no.
You must have been dreaming.
You don't have a cat.
Well, I saw him.
It was real.
He gave me this spatula.
We're ho-ho-home.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Salem, you're back.
Safe and sound.
It is a wonderful life.
And you know what I realised?
There are worst places to be during the holidays than with your family.
Here, here.
Hooray.
ALL : Don we now our gay apparel Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la Toll the ancient yuletide carol Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la Well, it's after midnight.
Let's exchange gifts.
SALEM : Psst.
I got you something, but it's upstairs.
- So where's my present?
- It's more of a promise than a present.
- No present?
- Wait.
You'll like it.
I promise to appreciate you and respect your privacy.
- From now on?
- No, for like a week.
- That's it?
- Okay, ten days, - but that's my final offer.
- Deal.
For you.
A ring.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Marry me.
I don't care if you're poor and have no spine.
- Marry me.
- Monty, I would love to be your wife.
And here, this is for you.
Oh.
Oh, you shouldn't have-- My dear, this is a solid-gold cigarette case.
But you're a circus act, how could you afford this?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
My dad's loaded.
Oh, dear girl.
This is the best Christmas ever.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To family, and to friends.
Merry Christmas.
And to all, a good newt.
I think someone's really happy to be home.
Yeah, he's been having a great time all morning.
Next year, I don't think I'll even bother to buy him a gift.
This is good.
This is so good.
Oh, the wrapping.
Greens and reds.
Whoa, it's the best Christmas ever.
And it's great to be home.
Yes, yes, yes.
I think he likes my paper best.
Honey, don't you wanna ride your new motocross bike?
No.
You haven't played with your basketball.
- How about one on one?
- No.
- How about you're new train?
- No.
- Your dump truck?
- No.
- Your volcano?
- No.
Rex, give Daddy the spatula.
No, Santa gave it to me.
It's the best Christmas present ever.
He loves it so much.
Where'd he get it?
I guess the same place he got that Neil Diamond CD.
Hey, Dad, will you put on "Sweet Caroline" again?
No!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Yep, this is where I live.
Ai-ya-ya-ya-yai!
- Hey.
- Sabrina, you're home.
Just in time for our Cinco de Mayo celebration.
Cinco de Mayo?
It was just el New Year's.
We know, but while the rest of New England is complaining about the weather, we are turning up the heat with a little south-of-the-border fiesta.
- Crispy flauta?
- No.
- You guys are weird.
- Well, excuse us for having fun.
- We were going to ask you to join us.
- But if you're too uptight.
Don't say that.
There's nothing worse than when your parents call you uptight.
Come on, loosen up.
You know you want to wear a sombrero.
Now, try an olÃ©.
OlÃ©.
Hey, that was sort of fun.
All right, I'm in.
- Where's the salsa?
- Over here, but it's kind of spicy.
I think I can handle it, cat.
Hot, hot, hot.
Feels warmer in here already.
We'll be back inminutes.
So R equals seven plus 11 over two, or nine--  And R equals seven minus 11 over two, or minus two.
That's it.
I've reached my chalk limit for the day.
- What is it, Sabrina?
- I have a question.
I know that.
That's why I said, "What is it, Sabrina"?
Well, in that problem, the roots turn out to be round numbers, but what if the roots turn out to be irrational?
Irrational?
You mean, like teenage girls?
Just express those roots in radical form.
You mean as a fraction?
- Didn't you read the textbook?
- Yeah, but it's kind of confusing.
Well, let's find out who's confused and who isn't by having a little test tomorrow.
And you can all thank Sabrina for it.
I was just trying to learn.
- Hello?
Is Salem there?
- Speaking.
- It's Shelley.
Shelley?
Zelda, you'll never guess who called.
I'll give you a hint.
- Shelley.
- Shelley.
Your ex-girlfriend?
The one who left you?
She didn't leave me.
She just needed some time by herself.
- Two decades?
- Three.
But, and I repeat, but, from the sound of her voice, I'd say she has crawling back on her mind.
I see.
Did you happen to mention that you're a cat now?
Is it that noticeable?
Oh, not again.
Hilda, stop that.
It wasn't me.
- Sabrina?
- What's wrong?
Mr. Rothwell's giving us a huge math test tomorrow.
So now I have to go memorise formulas, like X equals why me?
You watch that finger, young lady.
Negative B plus or minus the square root of B squared minus four AC over two A.  Shake your whammy fanny Funky song, funky song Shake your whammy fa-- - Harvey.
- What?
You're singing "Funky Song".
Now it's gonna be stuck in my head during the test.
Sorry, I didn't even know I was doing it.
Well, I'm really nervous, so please don't sing.
Okay.
Negative B plus or minus the square root of B-- I hear you thinking it.
- I can't think it?
- Not while I'm studying.
- Can I at least finish this verse?
- Yeah, but hurry up.
- Okay, done.
- Good.
Negative B plus or minus the square root of-- I hate Rothwell.
Look, Sabrina, you know this stuff.
You know you know it.
You just have to relax.
I can't.
You see this?
This is me freaking out.
Okay, now, please, can I just study?
I promise, I won't make a noise.
You can turn the page.
- Gordie, hurry.
- Wait.
How do I find the slope of a line?
Oh, it's easy, you just-- I lost it.
The slope slipped.
If only we had more time.
Much better.
M equals I knew that.
Shake your whammy fanny Okay, it's M equals Y sub two, minus Y sub one, over X sub two, minus X sub one.
- You saved my life.
- Thank me later, right now, move!
Move, move, move.
Five, four, three, two-- - F. - Poor Emma.
I think she stopped to help that girl in the wheelchair.
Too late.
Bye-bye.
All right, let's get started.
The test consists of 15 questions, for a possible 100 points.
The first five are worth nine points, the next five eight points, the last five are little three pointers.
You may begin.
- What was that?
- I dropped my pencil.
Oh, please, I know what's going here.
You're leaning over to look at your neighbour's test.
- No, I-- - That's it.
Come sit at my desk.
You'll take the test there.
Then I won't have to worry about you cheating.
But I've never cheated on a test in my life.
Then this should be no problem.
SABRINA : Okay, get to work.
Negative B plus or minus-- HARVEY : Funky song, funky song  Harvey Why did I study with Harvey?
Because he's cute.
I wonder if we'll get married.
No, no, no.
Pay attention.
Negative B plus or minus-- I hate Rothwell, I hate Rothwell.
Oh, no, can he hear me think?
I've gotta relax.
Can't tense up.
Why is everyone writing so loud?
Why did Napoleon want to rule by himself?
No, math, stick to math.
You know this stuff.
You can do this.
Negative B--  - What?
- Pencils down.
Time's up.
"Then add one macadamia nut and he will have an expanding butt".
What's going on?
I heard an explosion.
Oh, you're just making soup.
No, I'm stirring up a little revenge for Mr. Rothwell.
- What happened?
- It was so humiliating.
He made me take the test in front of the whole class.
- Like, some sort of zoo monkey?
- Yeah.
Koko hate teacher man.
Anyway, I know I flunked, so I'm giving him an expanding butt until I can find the perfect revenge spell.
Well, you know, nothing says payback like just desserts.
"The spell that guarantees he'll get what's coming to him".
But it's only to be used as a last resort.
You might want to try to deal with him the mortal way first.
- You mean TP his house?
- No, talk to him.
I don't want to.
You talk to him.
- Mr. Rothwell?
- Yes.
Hi, I'm Hilda Spellman, Sabrina's aunt.
I wanted to talk to you about the test that she took today.
Excellent timing, I just finished correcting them, I'll find hers.
Oh, thanks.
See, she's upset because she thinks she failed it, but I know she didn't, because she's very bright and she studied so hard-- - She got an F. - That's impossible.
- Are you sure you added it up right?
- Ms. Spellman, I'm a math teacher, but feel free to double check.
There were 15 questions.
The first five were worth 40 points.
The next five were worth 45.
And the last five were worth 15.
Sabrina got two of the biggies, three of the middies, and one of the babies for a total of Oh, 15 questions, 100 points, carry the two - I have no idea.
- Forty-five percent.
Jeez, no wonder she failed.
But I didn't have a chance to study for this meeting.
More lizard's leg and don't skimp on the howlet's wing.
Let's put in this jar of cocktail onions.
- It's been in the fridge forever.
- Yeah.
- What smells so sweet?
- Revenge.
It's time to teach Mr. Rothwell a lesson.
With a number two cauldron?
- It can't be that serious.
- It is.
- Keep stirring.
- Wait, there's been a breakdown in communication.
I will go talk to him.
As physicist to algebra teacher, and we will work this out logically.
And no one seeks vengeance until I get back.
Can we at least make his butt a little bigger?
As big as you want it to be.
I wanted to discuss this rationally, but you're making it hard.
Hey, she failed the test.
- What do you want me to do about it?
- The circumstances were unfair.
If it makes you feel better, you can blame this on me, but I think we both know these problems start at home.
What problems?
Hey, if a kid can't master the quadratic equation, that says to me, dysfunctional family.
- We function just fine.
- Tell it to a social worker.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the gym.
This is so great.
Thank you so much for backing me up.
Well, you were 100 percent right about this guy.
Please, no percentages.
Is it revenge yet?
Mm.
It's really spiteful.
Let's finish the spell.
Hilda, you do the honours.
Adder's fork and blind-worms sting.
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing.
For a charm of powerful trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Take it away, Sabrina.
Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through fog and filthy air.
- Now what?
- Wait and see.
You cackled.
This is gonna be so cool.
Weird.
Rothwell is never late.
Maybe he called in sick.
Or maybe he had car trouble.
Or maybe the earth yawned and swallowed him up.
It could happen.
Oh, toothpicks.
I am late for the first time in my life, because I've been the victim of a great injustice.
- Yes.
- I got a speeding ticket.
Speeding ticket?
Three witches and a number ten cauldron and the best we could do was a stupid speeding ticket?
Maybe the lizard's leg wasn't fresh.
I thought it smelled funny.
Great.
Rothwell will probably just go to court and weasel out of it.
Court?
The spell is working.
He'll find his just desserts there.
Let's go early and get good seats.
And don't worry, justice will be served.
Oh, yeah?
Then how come his butt deflated?
What do you think?
Red Lamborghini.
This has to impress my ex-girlfriend, Shelley.
Sure.
Now all you have to do is lose the paws, the whiskers and the fur.
Hey, so what if I'm a cat?
This car says I got it going on.
It's a travesty of justice, sir.
I mean, I know red.
Red is the colour of rage.
And that light was not red.
It was yellow.
Yellow as the sunshine.
Well, in light of your flowery prose and the fact that the arresting officer didn't show, I'll cut your fine in half.
Half?
Sir, half an injustice is still an injustice.
Case closed.
This court is in recess.
Wait, come back here.
I want that judge.
He was easy.
- Mr. Rothwell?
- Do I know you?
Well, of course you wouldn't recognise me.
Not without tears streaming down my face like a harsh, unforgiving rain.
I'm Clifford Weaver, your former algebra student.
Wait, you're a novelist now.
You wrote Rage Against the System.
I loved that book.
It was full of hate.
There's Mr. Rothwell.
Oh, I think that's for us.
Either that's part of the spell, or the bailiff keeps steaks.
- I bet that's our judge.
- In the refrigerator?
Yes.
Witch judges take turns in the deep freeze to prevent media bias.
For example, Judge Samuels has been in here since 1956.
Wow, a man untouched by CNN.
Now, that's a good night's sleep.
Hi, Judge Samuels.
Here's the deal, we are-- Shh.
Not a word.
I must stay pure for the law.
Just a cup of cocoa and I'm in business.
Guilty.
Order.
One more outburst like that and I'll-- All right, I'm ready.
Court is in session.
Jeremy Rothwell.
You are charged with violating Vehicular Code, section 16-4, driving at an unsafe speed.
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.
You are also charged with violation of the Existential Code, section 63-B.
Multiple counts of being mean and unfair.
How do you plead?
What is this?
I never heard of an Existential Code.
You have to read the fine print.
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.
- Ha!
- Plea entered.
Strike the "ha".
Prosecution may present its case.
- Are the people present?
- We're the people.
We are?
Cool.
- Sabrina, what are you doing here?
- Didn't you hear?
We're the people.
- Proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honour.
The people would like to call as their first witness Clifford Weaver.
Mm.
Minty fresh for my lady.
I'd be more nervous if I weren't so good-looking.
And yes, he failed me.
But, I mean, listen to those words.
He failed me.
Throw the book at him, judge.
Thank you, Clifford.
Your Honour, I'd like to cross-examine this witness.
Well, then proceed.
Clifford, you wrote the book - Rage Against the System, correct?
- Correct.
Isn't it true that The New York Times picked you as the best of the new breed of angry young writers?
I resent that moniker, but, yes.
Well, what made you angry, Clifford?
Was it your mother holding your hand?
Was it the librarian patting your head?
Or was it me?
I gave you that anger.
I spoon-fed you that rage.
I made you what you are today.
You should thank me.
You never helped me.
That's a lie.
No further questions.
I've never been so angry in my life.
That's my second novel.
Quick, call another witness.
The people call the arresting officer.
- So he was speeding?
- Definitely.
- And was he mean?
- Mean?
Mean, disagreeable, unkind, knavish.
Mean.
Well, he threw his registration at me, then he muttered under his breath, "What a jerk".
But I heard him.
I have really good ears.
And lovely eyes.
Thank you.
No further questions.
The people call our next witness Sabrina Spellman.
Well, normally I don't like to say bad things about people, but, as I am under oath, Mr. Rothwell is completely unfair.
He doesn't like kids, he doesn't like math, he doesn't like teaching or chalk.
These are very serious charges.
Have you any proof?
I could call my friend Gordie.
- Proof, proof.
Any proof?
- It doesn't exist.
Mr. Rothwell's unfairness lies only in the hearts and minds of those students whose love of math he has destroyed.
Including yours, Sabrina?
It's too early to tell, but there's a chance that for the rest of my life, I will fear math.
I will sweat every time I have to calculate a tip.
I will put off balancing my chequebook.
I will play blackjack, but I will not understand it.
If you understood it, you wouldn't play it.
Thank you.
You may step down.
Counsellor, are there any other witnesses?
The people rest.
Would the defendant like to make a closing statement?
Yes, I would.
Your Honour, I'm not a babysitter.
I'm paid to teach math, and that is what I do.
Yes, I could be more sensitive, but let's face it, the world is full of people like me.
People who choose favourites, people who don't accept excuses, people who are unfair.
Well, life is unfair and I'm just helping my students to get used to that.
Mr. Rothwell, just one last question.
Do you intend to teach high school for the rest of your life?
Are you kidding?
I'm just doing this until I can start up my own software company.
Thank you.
Well, I shall return with my decision and a fresh cup of cocoa.
Flowers, soft lights.
What's missing?
Oops.
Almost forgot.
Oh, yeah.
I've reached my decision.
With respect to the Existential Code violation, this court finds you not guilty due to insufficient evidence.
With respect to the Vehicular Code violation, - the court finds you guilty as charged.
- Oh, nuts.
But we'll waive the usual $40 fine and instead sentence you to a lifetime of teaching high school algebra.
What?
That's not fair.
- Case closed.
- No.
No!
No, no, no!
This trial shall be stricken from all mortal memory.
Court is adjourned.
Wait a second.
How can being sentenced to teaching high school be sufficient punishment?
Because it's the worst thing Mr. Rothwell can imagine.
But now kids are gonna be stuck with him year after year.
Well, whether he means to or not, he teaches a valuable lesson.
- Some people are just jerks?
- Yes.
But if you study hard and you don't let him get to you, you'll pass algebra.
And then you can forget it.
But he's trapped in math forever.
So he did get his just desserts.
And now I think we should get frozen desserts.
The door's open.
- Salem?
I don't believe it.
You look even more stunning than the last time I saw you.
It's so good to see you too.
- No, stay back.
- Why?
You said you wanted to talk, so let's talk.
You want to talk?
- You have changed.
- You could say that.
- Is that your cat?
- That-- Yes.
They make incredible companions, you know.
So, what's on your mind?
Us and how we broke up.
See, at the time I felt shut out.
You were so consumed with global conquest and I resented taking a back seat to world domination.
But, here it is, 30 years later, and now I realise that you were the best thing that ever happened to me.
Go on.
I know it's kind of sudden, but I think we should give it another try.
I don't see why not.
I care about you.
You care about me.
Enough words.
Salem, hold me.
- Oh, Shelley.
- Oh, no, your cat.
Get off me.
- Salem?
- I can explain.
Salem?
Is that you?
- Yes.
- You're a cat?
- Technically.
- Who's your friend?
A mannequin?
How long were you expecting this to fool me?
Another 30 seconds?
All right, look, I got caught and they sentenced me to a hundred years as this.
This is not what I had in mind.
We can work it out.
Sorry, cat.
This is goodbye.
I loved you.
But I'm better now.
I like to snuggle, I have great night vision, and I'm super, super clean.
It's so unfair.
Which equals the square root of negative four, or two I. Got it.
Perfect.
You seem a lot more relaxed today.
Yeah, well, I decided I'm not gonna let Rothwell get to me.
And I'm even feeling a little sorry for him.
Did you hear the financing fell through on his software company?
And have you noticed how big his butt's gotten?
No.
Okay, last problem.
Shake your whammy fanny Funky song, funky song Shake your whammy fanny Funky song  Shh!
- Sorry.
Poor Salem.
Are you gonna be okay?
I guess, with time.
No.
Don't worry, you'll be happy again soon.
Please.
Shelley was the love of my life.
What would ever replace her in my heart?
Maybe this will help.
A giant ball of yarn!
Oh, this is the best ever.
I thought you'd like it.
Like it?
I don't even remember her name.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, shouldn't you be going to school?
- Yes.
- And shouldn't you be wearing pants?
- They're still wet.
- So?
Use magic to make new ones.
Magic jeans come out all stiff and new.
These are broken in.
Maybe I need to clean the lint trap.
- Don't.
That's a magic dryer.
- It is?
It fluffs, it folds and it never loses a sock.
But it's been on the fritz lately.
We're still waiting for the repairman.
- When was he supposed to show up?
- Sometime in the afternoon between 1968 and 1998.
Forget it.
I'll just wear clammy jeans.
Hey, they're stuck.
Ah!
Call the repairman, now.
Good look.
Wish I had my licence.
What are you making?
- Sugar cookies.
With bits of liver?
- No.
Sprinkles.
Ech!
- Hey, I'm back.
- Did you have fun at Jenny's?
It was amazing.
Last night we ate casserole, played Monopoly and then we watched TV.
How will you ever wind down?
It was so much fun to be in a normal house, with a normal family, doing normal things.
Is that why you've never invited Jenny for a sleepover?
Because you think we're weird?
That's a complicated question, but the short answer would be yes.
Well, that's ridiculous.
We can be as normal as anyone.
Watch.
I'm mixing by hand.
Just like a pioneer woman.
Now I want you to invite Jenny over.
How about next Friday?
I have my book club-- Jenny is not meeting your brainy friends.
Could I finish my sentence?
I have my book club, but I'll cancel it.
Now all you have to do is invite Jenny over.
- What if I forget?
- I'll remind you.
- Ow!
- And I promise we will be as normal as normal can be.
Tallyho.
Who wants to play miniature polo?
I'll have a talk with her.
So then Jenny's dad landed on Park Place and to pay the rent he had to borrow the money from her little brother.
It was super funny.
My family can't play board games.
Not since the Pictionary incident.
I still can't talk about it.
Well, maybe you should hang out at Jenny's house.
Her family's really nice.
And a little boring.
But they love you.
You should come over again this Saturday.
That'd be great.
Ow!
Why'd you kick me?
- I didn't kick you.
- That's weird.
- So, what time should I come over?
- Ow!
What is it?
Oh, just a reminder.
You know, I think it's my turn to have you over to my house.
- That sounds fun.
- You don't have to answer right away.
You should know, I have these two really weird aunts.
But I like weird.
I love weird.
I bask in the glow of weird.
You know, I think Jenny will fit right in.
Ow!
That was me.
Okay, looking normal.
Oh, gotta get rid of my magic book.
Come on.
Stay.
Good book.
Okay, now, Salem, we need to work on your meow.
Say what?
- Your meow.
It has to sound real for Jenny.
Let's hear it.
Okay.
Meow.
- Can't you do it more catty?
You mean, meow.
- Yeah.
That is so clichÃ©.
Humour me.
There's still something weird about this room.
I know.
There.
It was too neat.
Now it's perfect.
And you know, Salem, this could be fun.
I'm happy for you.
You should be able to have friends over.
- Or in other words  Meow.
Look, I'm plumping pillows all by myself.
I'm so impressed.
What smells weird?
- Hilda's cooking.
- Oh, no.
Hi, kitten.
I just made tuna noodle casserole.
What do you think?
I think you're both overdone.
Here.
I made a list of possible topics for tonight's dinner conversation.
Now, if one doesn't work, move on, but don't stray from the list.
Hey, I think I know what to talk about.
Towels?
Okay, she's here.
Tense up.
Relax.
It's the upstairs doorbell.
Upstairs doorbell?
For the linen closet.
We must have guests from the Other Realm.
Can't we pretend we're not here?
No.
What if it's someone important?
Fine, but I don't understand why our linen closet doesn't have a peephole.
- Spellman residence?
- Yes.
- I'm here about your dryer.
- I'll take you to the laundry room.
Oh, thanks.
Zelda, look.
Oh, you have-- - Don't be rude.
- Nothing.
He can't stay.
He has a tail.
What's wrong with having a tail?
Sabrina, you aren't a rumpist, are you?
A rumpist?
What's a rumpist?
Someone who judges other by their rear ends.
No.
Okay, not usually.
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's Jenny.
Is she a rumpist?
No.
But if she sees a repairman with a tail, she might get suspicious.
Oh, relax.
We'll keep him out of sight.
He'll fix the dryer and be gone before you know it.
It's probably her.
- Do I have to answer it?
- Yes.
Hey, you're here.
You too.
It's a great house.
Come on in.
I'll give you the grand tour.
Okay, here's a bunch of stuff we own.
All very normal.
Okay, let's go see if dinner's ready.
Well, it's kind of misleading to call that the grand tour.
From the hand towel to the guest towel, the beach towel to the bath sheet, towels have helped make our nation great.
Towels.
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Oh, the collapse of the economy on the Isle of Man.
Hilda, would you help me clear the table?
- I'll help too.
- No.
No.
You're our guest.
- What's going on?
- I found your problem.
You've got a lint gremlin growing in your dryer.
- Did you get rid of him?
- No, but I got a piece of him.
Well, find the rest.
Please and be quick about it.
Our niece has a mortal over.
Oh, a mortal.
I'd tuck in my tail, but it tickles.
So is everything okay?
- It's okay as apple pie.
- Wow, it's beautiful.
Couldn't be better.
Unless there's ice cream?
There is.
- In the freezer.
- Well, I'll get it.
My parents forced manners on me, I might as well use them.
I think everything's going really well.
Except for the lint gremlin that's escaped and is now running around the house.
- He got out?
Ah!
Jenny.
- Are you okay?
- No.
I just saw the hugest spider.
Spider?
That's great.
You know, because spiders eat other bugs.
Hey, how about we look at that ice cream?
- Yeah.
Wow, got lots of flavours.
- It's all nonfat.
Let's go up to my room.
Hey, let's race.
Look, you're winning.
Who is that?
Irwin, Vilia?
What are you doing here?
Our book club was cancelled tonight.
Didn't you get my e-mail?
No, we had to drop our AOL account because a certain person couldn't stay out of the chat rooms.
Where else can I be judged by how I think and not by how I look?
I'm sure it's difficult being a brain in a jar, - but you can't come in.
Taxi won't be back for two hours.
Sorry.
Think warm thoughts.
Goodbye.
Hilda, we can't just leave them outside.
They'll get brain freeze.
I thought we were going for normal.
Oh, the girls are upstairs.
We'll take the brains into the dining room and Sabrina will never know.
- Come on in.
Yay.
Okay, but I'd just like to point out that I am against this.
Oh, pardon my finger.
One-one thousand, two-1,000, three-1,000-- That's less than two miles away.
Yeah, we get a surprising amount of lightning around here.
This is such a great place.
I mean, how many people have their own turret?
I don't know.
Me and Rapunzel?
There's a totally gothic feel to this place.
Like anything could happen.
Could.
But doesn't.
Too bad.
That's like my dream.
Hey, I got an idea.
Want to tell each other secrets?
- Secrets?
- I'll go first.
Okay, ever since I read, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I've believed in other realms.
Like the way Edmund pushes past the coats and falls into Narnia.
I think that could happen if we could just find the door.
- Wouldn't that be amazing?
- Yeah.
Okay, now it's your turn to tell me your secret.
Well, I don't really have any secrets, I mean, you know me, I'm an open book.
Oh, come on.
Everyone has secrets.
Actually, I do have a secret.
I'd really like to tell you but it's kind of hard.
Well, Sabrina, you can tell me anything.
I promise I won't think it's strange.
Okay, well, the truth is, Jenny, I'm a really messy person.
- What?
- Total slob.
You're messy?
That's your big secret?
Yeah.
Shh.
- What was that?
- I'll go check.
You stay here and you stay here.
Salem, guard my door so Jenny doesn't go anywhere.
Okay?
Hey, dogs guard.
Cats watch.
And judge.
Ow!
- Vilia.
That was totally uncalled for.
Oh, my left lobe.
What's going on here?
We were discussing The Shipping News and Vilia got upset.
She telekinetically pushed me off the table.
That book did not deserve a Pulitzer Prize.
Please, if Wendy Wasserstein can win one-- Excuse me.
I thought you cancelled your book club.
Hey, hey, come back here with that.
He's got my pie.
You little lint ball, give me my pie.
This is insane.
I knew this wouldn't work.
Here.
I've gotta go tell Jenny that I feel sick and she's gotta go home.
We better get you back into some vital fluids.
Whatever you do, don't put me in with her.
Please.
Sabrina?
Hey, kitty, do you know where the linen closet is?
Meow.
- I know it's snooping, but all that talk about towels made me want to check theirs out.
Meow.
Meow.
- I found it.
Meow.
- What's up, Salem?
Jenny just got sent to the Other Realm.
- You're kidding?
No.
And I'm glad.
Everything can go back to normal.
Jenny?
Jenny?
Jenny?
Jenny, where are you?
Sabrina, what's all the shouting?
Are you all right?
No, I think Jenny got sent to the Other Realm.
Oh, now I'm sure she didn't.
Salem saw her go in the closet and shut the door.
Oh, then I guess she did.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Wow, am I in Narnia?
Who are you?
"Skippy, the overlord's underling".
Cool.
Can you talk?
Oh, you have a frog in your throat.
Where am I?
Limbo.
I'm in limbo.
Then I was right.
There is another realm.
And it's in Sabrina's linen closet.
Well, I wonder if Sabrina knows about this.
Man, she was holding out on me.
Well, is there anyone else here I could speak to?
I mean somebody who could talk?
No offence.
I'm just not very good at charades.
Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-five.
Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-six.
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-seven.
Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight.
Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine.
- That's all I can do.
- Wow, awesome.
Oh, thanks.
I've never seen a place like this before.
It's called a gym.
- Who are you?
- Jenny.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
You're joking, right?
No.
Should I recognise you?
Yes, I am Drell.
Head of the Witches' Council.
- You're a witch?
- Yeah, aren't you?
No.
I'm a mortal.
You're a mortal?
Really?
- That's funny.
- It is?
Why?
Because now I have to turn you into a grasshopper.
Skippy, man.
Where do you pick up these strays?
Don't look so sad.
You know you can't have a mortal.
You didn't feed the last one.
I don't see Jenny anywhere.
I thought you said she might be in limbo.
Well, she's not.
But don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
How you can say that?
Because sometimes when things get tough, denial is all we have.
Oh, hey, there's Skippy.
Help us.
We're looking for a girl named Jenny.
He's seen her, let's go.
Wait.
When in limbo, you have to limbo.
- I don't see Jenny.
- Good, because I see Drell.
Oh, hi, ladies.
Glad you didn't catch me doing anything silly.
Actually we were just looking for someone.
But she doesn't seen to be here, so we're sorry to disturb you.
Wait, maybe I have seen her.
- Is her name Jenny?
- Yes.
- Does she have green eyes?
- Yeah.
- Is she a vegetarian?
- Yeah.
Does he have a segmented body and ears on her thorax?
- No.
- Wanna bet?
Oh, dear.
- Jenny.
What did you do to her?
- I turned her into a grasshopper.
- Why?
- It was either that or a katydid.
You're gonna turn her back.
You're not gonna leave her like that.
Wrong.
The rules are very clear on what happens to mortals who cross over into this realm.
And as you know, rules are rules.
What rules?
I wanna see these rules.
Oh, Rule Bearer.
Hear ye, hear ye, the Rules of the Realm.
"Rule number one: No spitting.
Rule number two: All giants must wipe their feet before--" Could you skip to the part about mortals?
"Rule number 714: Any mortal who passes into this realm shall be transformed into a creepy, crawly thing".
That's the rule.
Here's your friend.
The jar is yours to keep.
I can't believe this.
Aunt Zelda.
Oh, honey, don't cry.
- Poor Jenny.
RULE  No, really, don't cry.
Rule number 55: No blubbering.
- Look, I just wanna be alone.
- Sabrina-- Let her go.
They need to redefine their friendship.
Oh, Jenny, what have I done?
Your parents are gonna be so mad at me.
I can't believe I dragged you into my weirdness.
Look, just so you know, I really did want to tell you my secret, which, I guess at this point is obvious.
Surprise, I'm a witch.
But it's not as much fun as you'd think.
I mean, all I wanted to do was spend one normal night at my house.
You know, one night to have a sleepover, eat a little popcorn, play some board games.
Was that so much to ask?
I'll take that chirp as a yes.
But anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Sorry.
How lame is that?
I mean, you're a grasshopper.
Sorry isn't enough.
You know, I know this won't make it up to you, but, Jenny, want a leaf?
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't know you were in here.
Do you mind if smoke?
It's only bubbles.
- Go ahead.
- Oh, I've been trying to quit, but my job is so stressful.
Stress.
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry about the rules.
I don't make them up.
I only read them.
And personally, I think 714 stinks.
I mean, what is so bad about mortals?
Nothing.
Especially Jenny.
She was the coolest.
So why not find a loophole?
- Loopholes?
- Yeah.
Don't you know the rule?
- What rule?
- I'm off duty, but rule number 803: For every rule, there is a loophole.
There are more loopholes than rules.
There's a chance I can save Jenny?
Yeah, but not for another five minutes.
I've gotta finish my bubbles.
It's not over yet.
Listen up.
"Mortals without conscious knowledge of the Realm may pass in and out of it freely".
Loophole.
But Jenny already has conscious knowledge.
- So we get rid of the conscious part.
- We knock her out?
No, we convince her she's having a dream.
- Then she can leave.
- No, she can't.
Yes, she can.
I have it in writing.
- Oh, toothpicks.
- Sorry.
Rules are rules, but loopholes are loopholes.
Okay, give it a try.
Hey, Sabrina, you're here.
No, I'm not and neither are you.
You're having a dream.
It doesn't seem like it.
It seems like you're just making swishy arm motions.
- Help me out here, would you?
- But you are dreaming, Jenny.
Oh, look at the size of this fruit.
And now, you have to have a test.
A test?
Well, what's it on?
I haven't studied.
- Invertebrate zoology.
- Better get to work.
The cuttlefish and the nautilus.
Compare and contrast.
I don't even know what any of these are.
And my pen.
Where's my pen?
- Time's up.
You failed.
- But I just started.
You've been working for hours.
And now look, your dead grandfather.
Come here.
Quick.
Get on this.
Run to him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
I'm running as fast as I can.
But I'm not getting any closer.
That's because it's a dream.
Maybe it is a dream.
- But there's still something missing.
- What?
Jack Wagner.
He's in all my dreams.
- There he is.
- Jack.
You made it.
- Well, where am I?
- In my dream.
This all seems so real.
Well, I'm a pretty visual person.
Like remember the time you rescued me from the evil King Herbert and we got married at Stonehenge?
No, not really.
But how could you forget?
You promised to love me forever and ever?
- Jenny, get a grip.
- Bye, Jack.
Don't go, Jack.
Don't go.
- You could try running after him.
- Oh, that never gets me anywhere.
I don't like this dream anymore.
I wanna wake up.
If you wanna wake up, you have to go to sleep.
- That makes no sense.
- Well, that's because it's a dream.
- Dream.
- Maybe I do need a nap.
You're very sleepy.
Very sleepy.
- It worked.
- Wake up!
Shh!
"Rule number 42: Let sleeping mortals lie".
Too bad, Drell.
Looks like I win this round.
RULE  Ha!
You tiny little witches are so annoying.
Tell you what.
Next week, you can go to Jenny's house.
- You know what I regret?
- What?
Not getting Jack Wagner's autograph.
Okay, now gently put her on the bed.
Yes, we did it.
- That was close.
- See?
Everything turned out fine.
At last, Marvin Gardens is mine.
It's just luck.
You know, having a brain doesn't help at all in this game.
Linty, did you eat my pie?
Yep, it's just another normal night at the Spellman's.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- You sleep okay?
- Like a rock.
Except I had the freakiest dream last night.
And you were in it.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
I went to another dimension and a giant witch named Drell turned me into a grasshopper.
- Sounds scary.
- Yeah, but fortunately Jack Wagner saved me.
Jack Wagner saved you?
You're sure I didn't save you?
I don't think so.
But it was fun.
I wish bizarre stuff like that could happen all the time.
Yeah, but, then again, you might not appreciate it as much as you'd think.
"Rule number 56: All witches must eat their carrots.
Rule number 57: Bats may not be kept as pets.
Rule number 58: Not using double negatives will be disallowed.
Rule number 59: All children under 10 must be accompanied by monkeys.
Rule number 60: No switching channels between programmes.
Rule number 61: All rules must have a beginning, a middle and an end, except--" Is that it?
I don't get that one.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Now, stretch and focus.
Can you feel the blood rushing to your brain?
No, but I feel my lunch making a move.
This is no fun.
If you don't enjoy yoga, you don't have to do it.
It's easy for you to say.
You're winning.
There is no winning and losing in yoga.
It's different from other sports.
It's more spiritual.
And you can't get hit in the face with a ball.
Now let's move on to a meditation.
Assume the lotus position.
Can you assume I've assumed the lotus position?
Now, let's chant.
Omm  Omm - Um, what do we do now?
- We empty our minds.
That, I can do.
Now release your burdens and lighten your load.
Omm Omm - Zelda.
- What?
Ow!
I thought you said this was low impact.
My biosphere.
Just what I needed.
Ow!
What was that?
Hilda, would you be a love and check my stocks?
Not me, not today!
- She's stomping already?
- I don't believe this.
Look.
- Look!
- Wow, who's your friend?
It's her first wart as a witch.
- Let me get the camera.
- No, it's gross.
How did I get it and how can I make it go away?
Usually they're caused by stress.
Just calm down and it'll disappear.
I'm calm, I'm calm.
It's still there.
I can see it.
What am I gonna do?
Harvey and I are to supposed to report on the rain forest.
But I am not going to school like this.
You can't skip school because of a wart.
- It's part of being a witch.
- It happens to all of us.
I once had one on the end of my nose for a decade.
Actually, it wasn't that funny.
I wanted to die.
Just be glad you can cover yours with a baseball cap.
Orioles?
I didn't know your were a baseball fan.
I'm not.
I'm a Brady Anderson fan.
He is so hot.
I love those sideburns.
Yeah.
I may be a house pet, but I totally see it.
Now, you're all set.
Off to school.
I feel like a balding, middle-aged man.
Only more bitter.
Are you sure I can't just make it a snow day?
- No.
- But everything's going wrong.
Look, I even broke my biosphere.
And my magic won't fix it.
Oh, I bet it's number seven plastic.
It repels magic and it can't be recycled.
Great, great, great.
- That's the spirit.
- I was being sarcastic.
So was I. Oh, great.
Great, great, great.
Sabrina, I need your help.
I have a burning question.
Now is not a good time.
I was supposed to meet Harvey in the library five minutes ago.
So can we talk about it at lunch?
Sure.
I'll just save my burning question until then.
Good morning, Sabrina.
Hey, you're an Orioles fan.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, love that Brady Anderson.
Bet he hits another Wouldn't that be great?
Great, great, great.
He's not here.
Great.
Where were you?
I've been waiting.
Sorry, my bus was late.
Hey, cool hat.
I didn't know you liked the Orioles.
I do today.
- Can I try it on?
- No.
Okay, let me show you what I made for our project.
First, this biosphere was going to show how the rain forest is a perfect self-supporting ecosystem, but I dropped it.
So now it shows the devastation caused by greedy timber companies.
- It's just a jar of dirt.
- It's called deforestation.
Okay, okay.
Now, I have something to show you.
It's just what our project needs.
He's the last of the spider monkeys, but you can call him Marty.
- Hi, Sabrina.
- A puppet?
See, I think our message will be much stronger if we give the tragedy of extinction a voice and a name.
- Marty?
- You can change it.
The point is, he lives in the rain forest.
He has credibility.
Watch.
See my prehensile tail?
It's a feature found only in New World monkeys.
I'm trying to like it.
I'm making every effort.
I hate it.
But it's a guaranteed A. Mr. Pool will eat this up.
- We're sticking with the biosphere.
- You mean the jar of dirt.
It's a biosphere.
As you pass the biosphere around, I think you'll see what Sting is so upset about.
- It's just a jar of dirt.
- That's enough, Libby.
Please continue with your project.
That is the project.
What's the point?
Yes, what's the point of the rain forest?
Well, it's-- It's home to millions of insects, plants and animals, including the spider monkey.
Did someone say spider monkey?
Who are you?
I'm Marty, the rain forest spokesmonkey.
- Delightful.
- Harvey, put the monkey down.
We begin our story deep in the Amazon.
So weep not for me, weep for the fate of the Earth.
Isn't that right, Sabrina?
Huh?
Yeah, what the puppet said.
That was terrific.
Very creative.
You've really brought extinction to life.
Now, before class ends, are there any questions?
Yeah.
Are you two free for my little brother's birthday party?
All right, read chapter 27.
And how about a big hand for Harvey and Sabrina, huh?
I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life.
What?
Come on, the monkey saved our butts.
Hey, guys.
Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?
- See, everyone thought it was lame.
- Mr. Pool didn't.
Like I care what Mr. Pool thinks.
- Sabrina.
- Oh, great.
I need sugar.
I'm going to lunch.
- Can I come too?
- Look, I just want to eat alone.
I was just trying to cheer her up.
Hey, Sabrina.
The Bell Jar, three puddings.
This can't be good.
- It's not.
- You want to talk about it?
No.
Didn't you have a burning question?
Oh, yeah.
See, lately I've been feeling like people aren't paying attention to me.
Get a puppet.
No, I was thinking of cutting my hair.
Just to shake things up.
But it's a big decision.
- Or 50,000 little ones.
- I'm serious.
Sometimes I feel like I'm a prisoner of my own curls.
Really?
That's fascinating.
Please go on.
Well, when people see my hair, they think--  - Hey, Sabrina.
- Libby, what do you want?
I forgot.
There was something I wanted to ask you about your project.
- Yeah?
- If the Earth's tropical forests are being wiped out at a rate of 67 acres a minute, how come you're wearing that stupid hat?
- Give it back.
- What is that?
Snow day.
- Hey, wart-face, you forgot your hat.
- And you forgot you're a goat.
Now go climb a mountain.
Great, great, great.
Hello, Sabrina.
You stormed in.
Uh-oh.
Is that your blizzard?
Yeah.
I blanketed the entire northeast.
Oh, and in local news, I turned Libby into a goat.
Come talk to me.
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?
I have to be a witch, I have to be a mortal, I have to be a teenager and I have to be a girl all at the same time.
- That's what's the matter.
Hey, at least you've still got your thumbs.
And a door on your bathroom.
Hey, look.
I found my Brady Anderson baseball card.
Who cares?
Brady Anderson is nothing to me.
Sabrina.
- How could you say such a thing?
- I'm in a bad mood.
Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.
Flan.
- Flan?
- The happy dessert.
Everyone loves the custardy goodness of a wiggly-jiggly flan.
You can have my share.
I just want to be left alone.
But flan-- I can't believe this.
It looks awful.
It's huge.
If you took it to a movie, it would want its own seat.
At least someone agrees with me.
I'm so sick of people trying to cheer me up.
I hate when they do that.
You can be in a bad mood if you want.
No one else thinks so.
Everyone keeps trying to make me feel better, and I just want to be left alone, you know what I mean?
You can come in here.
No one will disturb you.
- Can I do that?
- Sure.
- Step right through.
- Cool.
Wow, everything's flipped around.
Okay, door.
Wrong.
Door.
And my desk is over there.
Neetneves magazine.
I didn't know there was a whole world through my mirror.
Yeah, it's a great place for quiet reflection.
Good, I need some time to relax.
This is great.
Maybe I'll just look at the pictures.
- Did you hear that?
- What?
My stomach rumbling.
What's for dinner?
Whatever comes out of the end of your finger.
I'm too busy working to cook.
Oh, I know what I want.
Flan.
It's so wiggly.
I don't know whether to eat it or attack it.
Would you do me a favour and check on Sabrina, - see what she wants?
- I'm not sticking my head in there.
She's in a bad mood.
She might bite it off.
- You go.
- No, you go.
- No, you go.
- No, Salem will go.
What?
Good idea.
Safety in numbers.
Sabrina?
It's dinnertime.
She must be sleeping.
- She's not here.
- Where did she go?
- I have no idea.
Mayday, the mirror.
Sabrina must have passed through the looking glass.
Oh, no.
She's trapped in her own bad mood.
I don't see Sabrina.
Oh, I wish we could make these clouds lift.
There's nothing we can do.
Only she can get herself out of a bad mood.
I hope it doesn't take too long.
Oh, and I hope our counterparts aren't too rotten.
- Me too.
- Well, let's go.
Remember that time I got stuck in my own resentment and you didn't lift one finger to help me?
At least you got over it.
No, I didn't.
Seven a.m.?
I must have slept straight through.
- Hey, my wart is gone.
- You must have calmed down.
I feel so much better.
But I look like a mess.
There.
Well, thanks for everything.
I'd better get home and go to school.
Hey.
- What's going on?
- You're stuck.
Remember, you wanted to be left alone.
Oh, no.
Help me, help me.
Someone help me!
- I got it, I got it.
- Who are you?
- I'm Brady Anderson.
- The baseball player?
- You've come to help me?
- I'm thinking about it, but I'm not sure.
I mean, you did say I was nothing to you.
I didn't mean it.
I was in a bad mood.
Everyone was bugging me.
Well, if everyone was bugging you, did you consider that maybe the problem wasn't with the rest of the world?
- That maybe it was with you?
- No.
I mean, the things that happened weren't my fault.
- And I was under a lot of stress.
- I know about stress.
Yankee Stadium, playoffs, High school, science project, very big wart.
Okay, you win.
But only because of the very big wart.
My point is, we all live with stress.
That's why you have to learn to control your emotions, and not let your emotions control you.
Isn't that a lot to ask from a teenager?
Yeah.
And it will take you about 20 years to get good at it.
But you should start now.
I mean, if you want to get home.
I do.
I don't like it here.
I mean, for one thing, I'm right-handed.
I'm a lefty myself.
I fit in fine.
Okay, the first thing you have to do is make amends.
Easy, I'll just tell everyone I'm sorry.
Oh, and I'll turn Libby back from a goat.
- Good.
You've got a game plan.
- But I'm locked in.
- Here you go.
- How'd you do that?
I choked up on the knob.
- Good morning.
- Do you mind?
I'm working on an article.
Sorry.
I just wanted to get some breakfast.
- There, have some porridge.
- Thanks.
Oh, it's cold.
I'm sorry, Goldilocks.
The kitchen is closed.
Okay, I'll just go look for the others.
Good morning, Salem, checking your stocks?
Yes and they're all down.
Down, down, down.
Well, you know, what goes down must come up.
Thank you, Louis Rukeyser.
But if my stocks don't rally, I'll have to go back to dry food.
Now, please, I'd like some privacy.
Oh, great.
Great, great, great.
- Aunt Hilda?
- What do you want?
I'm a little under the weather.
Maybe I'll come back later.
Hey, good news.
The living room drought is over.
Sabrina, I need to talk to you.
Good.
Because I know you wanted to talk yesterday, and now I'm all ears.
So am I. - What happened to your hair?
- It's gone.
And it's all your fault.
So I wanted to talk to you and say I'm not talking to you.
Wait?
How is it my fault?
As my friend, you shouldn't have let me do this.
I'm sorry.
I was in a bad mood yesterday and I wasn't really listening.
My life is over.
Jenny, what you need is some perspective.
Okay, first of all, it looks good.
No, it looks better than good.
It looks fine.
And second, it's gonna grow out.
That's right.
I forgot.
Hair grows.
Now, just keep saying that and you'll feel better.
Hair grows.
Hair grows.
Now, I've gotta go find Harvey.
You wanna have lunch?
- Okay.
- Good.
- Oh, hair grows.
- Hair grows.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Sabrina, no, stay back.
- What's wrong?
- You shouldn't be seen with me.
No one should.
Not after how I embarrassed us both in biology.
You mean with Marty the monkey?
Don't even say that name.
I'm trying to forget.
- But he was cute.
- He was lame.
You even said so.
Because I was in a bad mood.
But today, I love puppets.
Where is the little guy?
We had a fight.
- He's over there on the floor.
- Oh, no.
Marty, are you okay?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about my friend Harvey.
Well, let's go see if we can cheer him up.
Okay.
- Hey, Harvey.
- What, Marty?
Sabrina's sorry.
Very sorry.
And she thanks you for saving her butt.
- You know, he is kind of cute.
- And he's the reason we got an A. When you put it that way, I feel bad that I ripped his eyes out.
- Hey, Marty's used to tragedy.
- Hey, that's my homework.
- You're eating my homework.
- Libby?
Okay, Libby, I may not be able to stomach saying this to you after I undo the spell, so I'm sorry.
I was in a bad mood yesterday, but that's no excuse for turning you into a goat.
Even though you totally deserved it.
Then we understand each other?
What am I doing in the girls' room?
- You were gonna wash your hands.
- I was?
Ew!
So I was just wondering.
Is everything cool between us?
It never was, freak.
Good to have you back, Libby.
Gotta go.
- Oh, I'm up.
- Brady, you're at my school.
How do you have time to follow me around?
I'm your spirit guide.
And it's the off-season.
I think you should know, I've been making amends left and right.
I mean, right and left.
Anyway, Jenny, Harvey and Libby are all fine.
I'm afraid that's not enough.
You see, your bad mood had a ripple effect.
- It spread further than you think.
- Like to Guam?
No, but beyond those three.
Frankly, you have to cheer up the whole school, including Mr. Pool.
- What happened to Mr. Pool?
- You might want to check.
- Mr. Pool?
- Is it morning?
- Yeah.
- I survived.
Survived what?
My car wouldn't start because of the blizzard, so I got stuck here.
And guess what.
- They turn off the heat at 6.
- That's terrible.
What's worse was that I kept hallucinating that there was a goat running around the school.
I know this sounds weird, but the goat was really snotty.
Forget about your horrible, twisted dream.
I know something that'll cheer you up.
Sabrina, trust me.
Nothing could make-- Brady Anderson?
Oh, I don't believe it.
I'm your biggest fan.
What are you doing here?
I'm in town for some motivational speaking.
- To what group?
- Sabrina.
- Would you sign my brain?
- Sure.
Look, I need to go.
There's something I need to do.
Which hemisphere?
Just right along the cerebellum is fine.
You look different.
Are those new earrings?
- Actually, they are.
- People tell me I'm not perceptive.
SABRINA : Attention, students.
This is Sabrina Spellman.
I'd like you all to know I was in a bad mood yesterday and I just want to say I'm sorry.
And to make it up to you, I have a surprise in the cafeteria.
So if you'll please proceed in an orderly fashion.
- It's beautiful.
- I've never seen anything like it.
It's flan.
And there's enough for everyone.
Here, Libby, have some flan.
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.
- All right, party time.
- Oh, Sabrina, I'm working.
Okay.
Then I'll just put this flan down over here.
Flan?
I haven't taken a break in six hours, but I will for flan.
Did someone say flan?
- I could go for some flan.
Never underestimate the power of flan.
I'm going home.
Ow!
- Solid contact.
- Brady?
I came to say goodbye.
I'm really glad it all worked out.
Thanks.
I couldn't have done it without you.
- You really put things in perspective.
- That's the key.
Now, get back to the real world.
And remember, life is a team sport.
Life is a team sport?
How stupid does that sound?
I'm home.
- You got out of your bad mood.
- Good girl.
What did you bring me?
- A big kiss.
Hey, hey, I can groom myself.
I'm sorry I made such a mess of everything.
We cleaned it up.
We even kept the blizzard going so all your friends could have a snow day.
And we changed Libby back from being a goat.
But not before taking a Polaroid so you could treasure the memory forever.
So the real world kept going without me?
- Teenagers.
- Then there's a call I have to make.
You don't have to order me a pizza, but make it half sausage, half clams.
Hello, Jenny?
Did you cut your hair?
No.
Good.
Don't.
It would be the biggest mistake of your life.
No, a trim would be fine.
Look, I'll call you later, we'll discuss every hair.
Okay.
Bye.
- I'm in such a good mood.
- Well, then, we should celebrate.
And there's no better way to celebrate than with a woggly-joggly flan.
This is great.
Great, great, great.
I was being sincere.
Yuck!
Ooh.
No.
- Yuck.
- Enough.
I'm not gonna stand here all day watching you.
Wait, come back.
Which sweater did you like?
Hey, how am I supposed to figure this out without you?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Salem?
Yes.
Does this sweater make me look fat?
- A little.
- I don't get it.
Zelda's clothes usually fit me fine.
Hilda, coffee's ready.
Aha!
Caught you.
Well, I'm kind of hard to miss today.
What's with this sweater?
I put a spell on my clothes so you wouldn't borrow them without asking me.
A booby trap.
You are so sneaky.
You know, it makes your legs look really thin.
- It rubbed off?
- Yes, I put a time release on it.
You'll be that way for an hour.
You never did learn to share.
Well, I'd be happy to if you just learned to ask.
- What are they arguing about?
- Like I listen.
Cute sweater.
It's Zelda's.
You might want to ask her before you put it on.
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.
Look, it fits perfectly.
What's happened?
Oh, no.
She got you too.
This sweater's hexed.
Why can't I just live in a normal house?
Why can't a sweater just be a sweater?
Poor Sabrina.
Zelda, could you give me a hand here?
Of course.
Grease is "a" word, not "the" word.
Are you kidding?
I'd love to meet the Violent Femmes.
When?
Where?
They'll be signing CD's at Music City in Boston.
Tonight at midnight.
Midnight?
That's perfect.
I have no conflicting plans.
- But I still have to ask my aunts.
- Just tell them what I told my parents.
It's an astrology field trip.
Don't you mean astronomy?
Wow, they're paying even less attention than I thought.
This will be so much fun.
You, me and the Violent Femmes.
You're going to see the Violent Femmes?
- Yeah.
- You have to let me come with you.
I will do anything to meet Gordon Gano.
You know I hate this word, but, please?
The more the merrier.
- All right.
You can come.
- Thanks.
This is so great.
I love the Violent Femmes.
You're going to see the Violent Femmes?
- Can I come too?
- No.
Jeez, Gordie, you can't just invite yourself along.
I thought you just said "the more the merrier".
Twist my words, why don't you?
Look, it's my car.
And I say any Femmes fan is welcome.
So, Gordie, you're in.
- Cool.
- Cool.
- Cool.
- Shotgun.
Boston, midnight, rock band.
- It sounds kind of dangerous.
- Oh, but it's not.
- It's totally safe.
- What's the name of the band again?
The Violent Femmes.
Which is completely ironic because there aren't even any femmes in the band, let alone violent ones.
Look, maybe if you had some adult supervision.
Hilda and I could go along.
That would be the most embarrassing thing ever.
I can't show up with old people.
Now don't try sweet-talking us.
You know what I mean.
Come on.
Don't you trust me?
We do.
But there are lots of sickos out there that we don't.
And there's always peer pressure which can cloud your judgement.
So in other words, you trust me, but you don't trust me.
I'm glad our position is clear.
- You have to let me go.
- Not without adult supervision.
Then I can't go.
You guys ruin everything.
We ruin it because we care.
It's so hard.
I wish there was some sort of compromise.
There must be some way to make us all happy.
She could-- No.
Or we could-- No.
Or what if?
This stinks.
If it was up to them, I would stay in my room and never have fun.
I'm a house pet.
It's hard for me to sympathise.
Hey, have you checked out the dust bunnies under your bed?
They're fun.
Sabrina?
- What?
There's someone here to see you.
Who?
Open the door.
Surprise.
- Do I know you?
Don't you recognise us?
I'll give you a hint.
That was it.
Oh, my God.
What are you guys up to?
We know you objected to adult supervision, but how do you feel about teenage supervision?
You'd go with me to the Violent Femmes?
Yes.
Your friends will never know and you won't have to be embarrassed.
Just incredibly weirded out.
Ow!
This body pinches.
Don't slouch.
So - what do you think?
- I don't know.
I mean, for one thing, your voices do not sound like normal teenagers.
We can change that.
Is this better?
And how about me?
Oops, wrong direction.
Ahem.
There we go.
Not bad.
Maybe this could work.
- Far out!
- Swell.
- The word is "cool".
- Cool.
- Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
- Cool.
That is so creepy.
What are you doing?
Harvey will be here any minute.
I was just making us some snacks.
- Hey, I can take stairs two at a time.
- Is that what you're planning to wear?
- Why not?
- Here, try this.
Hey.
Don't I look cool?
Next.
- My midriff is showing.
- You're 16.
It's okay.
I am not leaving this house dressed like a hussy.
You are or you're not going.
It's Harvey.
Let's go.
Now, remember, you're my extremely shy cousins, Hilda and Zelda.
Wait, no one would name their kids that.
Okay, you're Hillary and you're Zellery.
- Zellery?
- Yeah, your parents were hippies.
Go.
It's very uncomfortable in here.
Yes, but we're teenagers.
We don't care.
Can you turn the music down?
It's a little hard to take.
It's the Violent Femmes.
Oh, I love them.
Turn it up.
Hands back on the wheel.
Ten and two.
Ten and two.
Jeez, someone took driver's ed a little too seriously.
She's right, you know.
I'm always saying that to people, but they just don't listen.
- Fools.
- Gordon Gano.
- Gordon Gano.
Gordon Gano.
- What are you doing?
Reminding myself why I'm in this clown car.
Gordon Gano.
Just think.
The Violent Femmes are breathing this same air.
- Cool.
- Cool.
Cool?
It's downright cold.
Where are the guys?
Shouldn't they have parked the car by now?
And why isn't this bakery open?
Stop complaining.
This is what we drove here for.
How smart.
Libby brought a book.
"The Magic Within"?
Now, what's that about?
I'm going to cast a spell on Gordon Gano.
A spell?
Like witchcraft?
Oh, please.
That's just twaddle.
This is a self-help book.
It teaches you how to summon your feminine powers.
That's the magic within.
Hence, the title.
If it works, when I meet Gordon Gano, he won't be able to resist me.
- What do you mean?
- You'll have to shell out the 12.95 for the details.
But I learned how to do this thing with my eyes that will bring any man under my spell.
Does it go something like this?
No.
And I'm not gonna waste my powers by showing you.
In fact, I'm supposed to start conserving my energy now.
Hey, there they are.
Who?
I can't see.
It's Harvey and Gordie.
- Man, this line is really long.
- Wow, Libby, you look cool.
- Thanks.
Wait, did Gordie say that?
He knows nothing about cool.
- Oh, that is so cute.
- I wish I brought my camera.
What are you doing?
- I thought you might be cold.
- Actually, I'm warm.
In fact, I'm even feeling a little flushed.
I'm cold.
Perhaps because I'm barely dressed.
Oh, would you like my scarf?
Thank you, Gordie.
How kind.
Zellery, can I speak to you a moment?
What are you thinking?
You just took Gordie's scarf.
So?
I'll give it back.
No.
That means he likes you.
And by accepting it, it means you like him.
It's the teenage code.
It's just a scarf.
You are so naive.
We're moving.
We're moving.
We stopped.
I don't believe it.
How long is this gonna take?
And frankly, I think it's time for Alan Greenspan to step down.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Well, that was a fun conversation.
Now can we talk about anything else?
Music, cars, food.
That reminds me.
Anyone want snacks?
- Yeah.
- I brought carrot sticks - and hard-boiled eggs.
- My favourite.
Who taught her what a snack was?
My legs hurt.
We should have brought chairs.
You know, to sit on.
We know what chairs are.
I'm cold.
I want to go back to the car.
- Great idea.
- I'll walk you.
- Harvey, toss me your keys.
- Here you go.
Hey, bad throw.
Let's go.
I can't take the waiting any longer.
I'm going to see what the holdup is.
Boston really seems to have blown your cousins' minds.
Yeah, they're not as grown up as they think they are.
Well, at least we're alone now.
Except for the little match girl.
It was very sweet of you to see me back to the car.
I'll make sure to lock the doors when you go back.
I'm not going back.
But you'll miss the Violent Femmes.
I'd rather be with you.
I want to know everything.
Let's start with how you got such an unusual name.
Zellery.
It's not that unusual.
I think it's tantalizing.
And very poetic.
It rhymes with celery.
You are just delightful.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I have a question.
- Gas station at the corner.
- No.
My friends and I have been waiting for a very long time.
I'm feeling a tickle in my throat.
So I was wondering if we could pop in, say hello to the band and go home to bed.
You mean, let you cut in line?
I think Andrew Jackson can explain it better than I can.
Hey, I don't let anyone cut.
Especially not for a 20.
But I'm sick of waiting.
Then you have two choices: Continue to wait or go home.
But I-- Or keep pushing me and you won't get in at all.
Now, get back in the line.
I don't like your tone.
I want your badge number.
Move your hand.
I said get back in line, missy.
Missy?
Who are you calling missy?
- I'm glad you got cold.
- Me too.
Sabrina.
- All warm.
We need to talk.
Gordie just asked me to go steady.
I knew it.
What did you say?
I'm thinking about it.
What?
I forbid you to date Gordie.
I mean, I'm thinking about how to say no.
I don't want to hurt his feelings.
I warned you about wearing his scarf.
But would you listen?
No.
Maybe you could talk to him for me?
You got yourself into this mess, you get yourself out.
- How else are you gonna learn?
- But I-- Unfair.
And don't pout, Aunt Zelda.
Your face is gonna freeze like that.
Now, go let him down gently.
- What's going on?
- Oh, my cousin's got a little problem.
Hey.
Get back here.
Sabrina, help.
- Isn't that your other cousin?
Hey.
Yeah.
Just think about it.
I've got all night.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Gas station on the corner.
No, you have my cousin in your car.
And I was just wondering, is she in big trouble?
- She stole my badge.
I want it back.
- If I could just talk to her, - I'm sure I could straighten things out.
- Fine, you talk to her, because I don't want to.
So would you like to tell me what happened?
- No.
- I can't help you if you don't tell me.
- I didn't do anything.
- What's in your hand?
If you give the badge back, he'll let you go.
- I don't want to.
- Aunt Hilda, give the badge back.
Sir, here's your badge.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Don't you have something to say?
- I'm sorry.
- Like you mean it.
- I'm sorry.
- That's better.
Now, go ahead.
Get back in line.
- I'm glad that's over.
- We'll talk about this more at home.
- Gordie?
- Don't.
The pain is still too fresh.
Did they call Hillary's parents?
No.
I think I'm cold again.
- How are you doing?
- Terrible.
- These hormones are driving me nuts.
- I know.
I forgot how emotional life is when you're a teenager.
No kidding.
Once was enough.
The line's moving.
- Are we getting close?
- Real close.
- Watch out, manhole.
- Ah!
Just kidding.
All right.
We're next.
Finally.
This is gonna make up for everything.
Hey, on behalf of the Violent Femmes, I want to thank you all for waiting.
- Are we going in?
- Unfortunately, the store is now closed.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
Oh, boy.
Can I talk to you a moment?
Look, I'm sorry about the timing-- You have to let us in.
I mean, talk about Violent Femmes, if they don't meet the band, they will be four extremely violent femmes.
I'm the one who has to drive them all back to Westbridge along with one lovesick dude.
Do not make me do that.
You know what I'm saying.
You've been there, right?
Hartford.
Led Zeppelin.
1973.
- Go on in.
- Thank you.
Really, thank you.
Do you see them?
Yes.
Oh, there they are.
I thought they said the last group was the last group.
No, I guess the last group was the second-to-last group.
- Now, this group is the last group.
- Oh.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
- Put me in front of Gordon Gano.
You are in front of Gordon Gano.
Oh, let me summon my magic within.
- Gordon.
- Thanks for coming.
Aren't you going to look at me?
- Do you have a question?
- Yes.
Which do you prefer, stuffing or potatoes?
Huh?
- Is something wrong with your eyes?
- Should we help her out?
A half-hour infatuation spell ought to work.
Wow!
You're fantastic.
- I must know your name.
- Libby Chessler.
Can I play a song for you, Libby Chessler?
If you like.
Guys, let's do "Please Do Not Go".
But I have a cramp in my hand.
And we don't have our instruments.
We'll use these.
Come on.
It's for Libby.
A one, two, three, four.
Tell you, man, I'm stuck on this Lovely girl 'Cause to me she mean All the world But then she like another guy I fall down dead She never see the tears I cry I said, please, please Please do not go Please, please, please Do not go This is so - Cool?
- Yeah, cool.
I wrote that for you, even before I knew you existed.
I thought so.
Happy?
The car is outside.
We've gotta go.
This can't be it.
I just met you.
Hey, why don't you come hang with us at the hotel courtesy suite?
Would you?
Would you?
- Sure.
That sounds like fun.
- Great.
We're at the Copley Plaza.
Bring any friends you'd like.
She said yes!
It worked.
It totally worked.
I unleashed my magic within.
And now we get to go party with the Violent Femmes.
Not so fast.
Gordon said I could bring anyone I wanted.
I'm cool with you and the boys, but I'm afraid that doesn't include the Olsen twins.
What?
But-- They came with us.
We can't ditch them.
They're no fun.
All they did was whine, complain, and talk about the Federal Reserve Board.
Frankly, they're an embarrassment.
You owe them more than you think.
- I owe them nothing.
- You ate an egg.
You are on the verge of cool here.
Don't blow it.
Now, are you gonna dump them or not?
No.
Hillary and Zellery aren't just my relatives, they're my friends.
And if they don't go, I don't go.
Come on, Harvey, Gordie.
If Sabrina's not going, I'm not going.
And if Harvey's not going, I'm not going.
Fine.
More classic '80s rockers for me.
I'll take a cab and go alone.
See you.
We can't let her go alone.
It's not safe.
Someone has to go with her.
Not Harvey.
He's our ride.
I've got it.
Gordie, could you do me a favour?
Anything.
You could sit closer.
Not tonight.
Sabrina, can we talk?
Now's not really a good time.
Maybe next week.
- I feel awful.
- She was right.
We do ruin everything.
We've got to make it up to her somehow.
I know, we could-- No.
Or, what if--?
Wait, first I've got to get out of this body.
Me too.
After you.
- Much better.
- My turn.
Oh, I'll say.
- Can we come in?
- I suppose.
Oh, good.
You're back to what passes for normal.
Look, we're really sorry we embarrassed you.
And we feel we owe you some fun.
So Ta-da!
- I get to clean the house?
- No.
- You get to fly.
- On a vacuum?
Yes.
See, old-time witches used broomsticks, but vacuums are must faster and more efficient.
You're gonna let me fly?
I don't believe this.
It's true.
You proved tonight that you can handle the responsibility.
We were very impressed by the way you refused to buckle to peer pressure.
And most importantly, you called us your friends.
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.
- Is the bag inflated?
- Check.
- Are you set for low shag?
- Check.
Then you're all ready for liftoff.
Now, keep your hands at 12 and 6.
- Don't flood it.
- I won't, I won't.
- She's up.
- I'm up.
This is great.
Wait, you forgot to tell me how to land.
Just use the magic within.
I'm flying and cleaning the air at the same time.
I think I'll buzz the Copley Plaza.
I thought we were gonna party, not watch stupid cartoons.
Shh!
I missed what Ren said.
He's going to the Muddy Mudskipper show.
I've seen this one three times.
Yeah, it really holds up, doesn't it?
I can't believe this is what you guys do for fun.
Don't you want to play more songs for me, Gordon?
- Not really.
- Are you sure?
Maybe you should have your eyes checked.
My reserves must be depleted.
Come on, Gordie.
Let's go home.
In a second.
This is my favourite part.
- Mine too.
- Gordie, you're the coolest.
Unbelievable.
Maybe I do need to get my eyes checked.
I can see my house from here.
- Hey.
- Hello, Sabrina.
- How was school?
- Fine.
How's Harvey?
Oh, he's got a bit of a cold.
- And Libby?
- Unfortunately, she's great.
She won't stop talking about the Violent Femmes.
So everyone's fine?
Everyone?
You know, you can ask about Gordie if you want.
Well, did he say anything about me?
I mean, Zellery?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact he did.
Really, what?
Let me try and get every word exactly right.
He said, "Tell her I want my scarf back".
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
All done.
Dinner was delicious.
I don't believe you finished off your lima beans.
I'm an adult and most of mine are in my napkin.
What can I say?
I love lima beans.
Are you sure you didn't make them magically disappear?
Aunt Zelda, I'm offended you would even ask me that question.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll clear.
A kid who likes lima beans?
Being a witch is just the tip of her weirdness.
There's still something fishy.
Did you notice how she dodged my question?
Oh, come on.
Sabrina's not that cagey.
There's only one way to find out.
Remember that spell mom used to cast to make sure we'd eaten our vegetables?
Oh, I hated that spell.
- Hated what spell?
- This.
What's that all about?
A spell to bring back any lima beans you may have made disappear.
What?
Get down.
I told you I hated that spell.
I'm gonna go ride my pig.
I mean, hog.
There.
- What am I looking for again?
- The Olympus Mons.
It's the largest mountain in the solar system.
I see a little bump.
- Now can we spy on the neighbours?
- No.
Now, that little bump happens to be the best skiing on Mars.
And that's where we're going for our winter vacation.
- We're going to Mars?
- It's a trek, but it's worth it.
You'll love the red planet.
It's so pretty and the sky is pink.
- So, what are the Martians like?
- Martians?
- Aren't there Martians?
- No.
Jeez, Sabrina, get in touch with reality.
So Louis XIV was succeeded by another Louis, who was known as?
Any guesses?
Okay, I see winter break has already started.
Well, I can't let you go before the bell, so just try to keep it quiet.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Louis XV.
No.
What are you doing over vacation?
Oh, I'm going skiing with my aunts.
- Out west?
- Actually, north.
- How about you?
- I'll be here.
In fact, I was hoping you'd be here too so maybe we could do stuff.
Really?
I wish I had known.
I love doing stuff.
This trip's not gonna be any fun.
I mean, I don't even know how to ski.
You could take lessons.
Oh, great.
So I get to study on my vacation.
Come on, you'll have a blast.
- And I'll see you in five days?
- Six.
Man, six days.
Well, I'd better go catch my bus.
I guess this is it.
See you.
Bye.
Wow.
I just don't understand why other kids get to stay home and I have to go on a ski vacation.
You were so excited about it last night.
Well, a lot's changed since then.
I mean, just today, Harvey asked me if I wanted to do stuff.
Well, there'll be plenty of stuff left to do when we get back.
Why don't you guys go?
I'll stay with Salem.
Hey, the whole point of a family vacation is so I can get a vacation from the family.
Please, I need some downtime.
It's not up for discussion.
You're going, and that's that.
Fine.
I'll go to Mars, but I won't have any fun.
Do what you want, but I think you're overreacting.
I mean, it's not like you're never gonna see Harvey ever again.
Here he is now.
Don't you love when things like that happen in real life?
Hey.
Hi.
I hope it's okay I stopped by.
Sure, your timing's perfect.
My aunts were just about to take naps.
Oh, right.
Oh, so tired.
Oh, I hope I can make it up the stairs.
Come on in.
So, what's up?
I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk.
You're going skiing and you can't afford to lose your mittens, so I got you these.
They're called mitten minders.
You string them through your jacket.
My little brother swears by them.
That's so thoughtful and stretchy.
Thanks.
Anyway, I gotta get the car back to my mom.
Hey, maybe I could call you from the lodge to let you know how the mitten minders are working.
Really?
I'd like that.
I'd like that a lot.
Well, when should I call?
- Tonight around 9?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Oh, creak.
Oh, these old homes are so creaky.
- Well, you'd better get going.
Yeah.
Have a great trip.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Bye.
See you.
Sorry, I got caught up in the moment.
- Come on, Sabrina.
- Mars is waiting.
I'm coming.
- Is that all you're bringing?
- We've got these.
Salem, you have the number of the lodge in case you need to reach us.
And we left you plenty of food.
Don't eat it all in one day.
Oh, right, I forgot.
I'm an animal.
I have no self-control.
- And no parties while we're gone.
- I'll cancel the black-and-white ball.
Well, then I guess we're off.
Woo-hoo.
Bye.
Have fun.
Miss you.
A party?
Why didn't I think of that?
Watch your step.
These stairs are a little icy.
The whole lodge is a little icy.
Isn't it beautiful?
And it's a perfect time of year.
At the end of the season, the rooms get a little slushy.
- What's that?
- A volcano.
Oh, there she blows.
I'll just get an energy bar and then I think I'll hit the slopes.
I think I'll hit the couch.
- Aren't you going skiing?
- Oh, I don't ski.
I lodge.
All I need is a stack of magazines.
And some catalogues.
And Tolstoy's classic War and Peace.
I think I'll read that last.
So when does the family part of this family vacation begin?
- We'll all meet for dinner.
- Well, what am I to do until then?
We thought you'd wanna hang out with people your age.
All the people my age are on another planet.
- I'm calling Harvey.
- Oh, you can't.
Mars is in a time zone that's so far ahead of Earth, it's still yesterday there.
If you call Harvey, he'll explode.
This stinks.
I'm going to my room.
She'll find the Toblerone in the minibar and be fine.
- Well, enjoy your day.
- Enjoy yours.
Wow.
Oh, I love this planet.
Oh, what a day.
I'm exhausted.
Read me War and Peace.
Morning.
- Morning.
You going skiing again?
Yes.
Are you reading magazines again?
Not today.
I thought I'd take it easy.
- Morning.
- Did you sleep all right?
I slept fine, only problem was I woke up here.
Cheer up.
I promise today will be more fun.
I'm gonna get you a ski lesson.
Don't bother.
My day's mapped out.
I'm gonna analyse you guys in my journal until 9 and then I'm calling Harvey.
I'll be by the phones.
There's no sign of the policyholder yet, but I will not rest until said policyholder has been found.
Now, I plan-- I can't talk.
There's somebody here.
Um, okay, goodbye.
I love you.
No, I just said that to throw them off.
Yeah, you hang up.
Okay, it's all yours.
Thanks, but I won't be using it for another 12 hours.
Really?
How very interesting.
February 5th, again.
Are you Sabrina?
Yeah, but I'm kind of busy, so if you wouldn't mind waiting until I'm finished.
- Period.
Done.
What did you want?
- My name's Doug.
Your Aunt Zelda just arranged for me to give you a ski lesson, but she said you might not be up for it.
I don't know where she got that idea.
I mean, when in Mars I will be back in 12 hours, won't I?
- Unless you're really uncoordinated.
- Oh, then let's go.
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit over there?
- Sure.
It's a free planet.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Ah, whoo.
I couldn't help but notice you from across the room there.
My name is Warren.
I'm a very successful insurance salesman and I am on an expense account you would not believe.
Oh, please.
You lodge lizards are all alike.
Look, we can chat, but not if you spend the next four days making up stories just to impress me.
- I would never-- - Let's make a pact.
For once, two strangers meeting on vacation will be completely honest with each other, okay?
- Okay.
You got it.
- Great.
- I'm a secret agent.
- What?
I'm here to sniff out a counter operative.
- You're not it, are you?
- No.
Good.
I'd hate to have to kill you.
So are you married?
What do I do?
I've never skied before.
Ah, you'll be great.
- All set.
You can ski.
- Just like that?
It's a short lesson, but pretty expensive.
Let's go.
Follow me.
Hey, wait up.
You're going too fast.
I'm new at this.
How do I stop again?
- How are you doing back there?
I'm doing fine.
Pff.
Pff, pff.
So let me get this straight.
Your mission is to bring down Dr. Cyclops, who, through his ring of operatives, is trying to destabilize the Balinese government.
Yeah, plus there's some unbelievable stuff that I just can't tell you about.
So, what kind of doctor is Dr. Cyclops, a psychiatrist?
No.
He's not really a doctor.
I mean, he may have a Ph.D., but Dr. Cyclops is just his code name.
And he hates it.
Where are all your clever spy gadgets?
Well, check out this baby.
- A toothpick?
- A poisoned toothpick.
Perfect, especially if Dr. Cyclops just had corn on the cob.
Hi, Aunt Hilda.
Finally.
I thought you were only going skiing for a couple of hours.
I thought so too, but it turns out I'm a natural.
- Hey, you want some hot chocolate?
- Please.
Great, you're just in time for our family dinner.
Actually, Doug and I wanted to collapse in front of the volcano.
Then Zelda and I will have a family dinner.
Actually, we just saw her on the slopes.
I think she's night skiing.
Great, then I'll just have a family dinner all by myself.
Uh, you know, I realise I'm not family yet, but I'd be happy to chow down with you.
- Would you let me try your entrÃ©e?
- Sure.
Okay.
Here you go.
Do you take marshmallows?
The little ones.
- Thanks.
- There you go.
This is nice.
Whoa!
Toasty.
Hey, you wanna play cribbage?
- I'd love to.
How does it work?
- You don't know?
- Now you do.
- Great.
Deal me six, we'll play till I skunk you.
- That could take a while.
- I've got time.
I don't believe this.
You have a talking dog?
- I have a talking cat.
- Really?
Don't pets make the best of friends?
I mean, you get total loyalty, unconditional love-- You've never had a cat, have you?
What's going on?
They turn the lodge into a cheesy disco at night.
- Do you wanna dance?
- Sure.
All right.
Ring.
Ring.
Hey, someone has to make a Science Diet run.
Wait.
Did I just hear the phone?
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Harvey.
Um, I know Sabrina's not home.
I thought you could get a message to her.
If it's short.
Um, I don't have anything to write with.
The message is that I'm going to sleep now, and maybe I'll talk to her tomorrow.
- Got it.
- Thanks.
Morning, ski bunny.
I ache all over.
Skiing is easy, but disco is hard.
You had a message at the front desk to call Salem.
I wonder what he wants.
- Hello?
Did I wake you?
No, you didn't wake me.
I was just reading.
- You were looking for me?
- Yeah.
Harvey called last night, and asked me to tell you he was going to sleep.
Weird.
I wonder why-- Oh, my God.
I totally forget.
I gotta go.
You're welcome.
I am such a jerk.
- Hello?
- Hey, Sabrina.
I am so sorry I didn't call last night.
I must be on Mars or something.
Hey, don't worry.
I wasn't, like, waiting by the phone.
So did you lose your mittens?
No, thanks to the mitten minders, my mittens were minded.
Hey, Sabrina.
Oh, you're on the phone.
- Yeah, I'll be off in a sec.
- Okay.
- Who was that?
- My ski instructor.
Oh, cool.
You took lessons.
Do you like your teacher?
Yeah, he's fine.
Well, it sounds like you're having fun.
Hey, I got all new socks and two new shirts yesterday.
That's great.
I can't wait to see them.
Okay, bye.
Aunt Zelda!
Aunt Zelda.
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Surprise?
I've been skiing behind you for the past five miles - screaming your name.
- What's going on?
I have a very, very serious problem.
Doug asked me to go on a picnic tonight.
Well, seriously, that sounds like fun.
But I'm not supposed to be having fun.
- Why not?
- I promised myself I wouldn't.
And then I met Doug and now I'm all confused.
I mean, how can I like Doug when I like Harvey?
Sabrina, you're very young and odds are, over the next 10 years, you will meet and like many different boys.
Thank you for that sweeping generality, - but what do I do about tonight?
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but I'm worried it would hurt Harvey's feelings.
Well, then, you have to weigh your desire to go versus your desire not to hurt Harvey.
Or I could go and Harvey will never find out.
Bad idea.
Relationships are hard enough when you're completely honest.
You start hiding things, you're taking a risk.
But it's your choice.
I can't make the decision for you.
Are you sure?
It would really help me out.
- Ah.
- Oh, you're back.
I made it all the way down Olympus Mons.
It was spectacular.
Uh!
You should have used more sun block.
Enemy transmissions are definitely coming from someplace into the--  - Who's she?
- My sister.
- Who are you?
- Warren.
He's a-- Insurance salesman.
Are you covered?
Just kidding.
Okay, let's go to the family dinner.
Shouldn't we wait for Sabrina?
She went off with Doug.
- Who's Doug?
- Her ski instructor.
I hope she made the right decision.
Here we are.
Wow, picnic in a crater.
Oh, it's not just a crater.
It's the best crater on the planet.
Mars is so cool.
You're lucky you get to live here all the time.
It's not that much fun.
After the season's over, it's just a lot of witch townies.
Well, I love it.
It's so different and exotic.
- Ham sandwich?
- Sure.
Both moons are really beautiful tonight.
Yeah.
Hey, there's the Mars probe.
Smile.
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm all right.
Are you sure?
Because I could put my arm around you.
That's okay.
I can just put my arms around myself.
I'm sensing you feel uncomfortable being here.
Should I walk you back to the lodge?
No.
No, I'm enjoying this.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm glad because I like you, Sabrina.
I like you too.
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna kiss you.
Kiss me?
Well, I don't even know you that well.
I mean, it hardly seems right to kiss someone when you haven't even shaken hands.
- All right.
Do you wanna shake?
- Okay.
- Now can I kiss you?
- I don't think so.
- Well, why not?
- It's your handshake.
No offence, but I've had better.
Well, that's not fair.
We had gloves on.
Give me another chance.
Okay.
Now, this time, I'm really gonna mean it.
Uh-uh.
Look, it's not your fault.
There's a guy back on Earth named Harvey.
And, well, when I shake his hand, I feel all tingly, and when I shake yours, well, frankly, it's a little sweaty.
It is not.
I'm sorry, but I have to be honest.
So you wanna go back to the lodge?
No, we can finish our picnic.
- I mean, we're still friends, right?
- Of course.
- Friends.
- Friends.
- Anything?
- Sorry.
We'll be back around 5.
Can you come by?
Great.
Sabrina, we have to go.
That's weird.
Warren said he'd be down to say goodbye.
Well, maybe he was captured by the evil agents from Allstate.
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
So he lied about everything.
He was very entertaining, so that makes it okay.
All set.
Hilda.
Hilda.
Oh, I was instructed to abort my mission immediately, but I couldn't leave without saying goodbye.
That's so sweet.
Oh, look, we don't have much time, so here, give me your telephone number.
Oh, jeez, not with that.
That's my vaporizing gun.
Okay, here, use a ballpoint.
You just never give up.
- There you go.
- I'll call you.
- Did you hear that?
- What an odd noise.
- Oh, no.
- What's going on?
Oh, this is the work of Dr. Cyclops.
She really knows how to pick them.
I'll always remember you, Hilda, unless they remove my brain.
I don't believe it.
I guess he really was a secret agent.
Apparently not a very good one.
But he told the truth.
That's amazing.
And very heartwarming.
If he ever escapes, you can bet he'll call.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just wish I had given him my real phone number.
Fluffy.
Fluffy.
Wake up, they'll be back any minute.
- Salem.
- Someone brought catnip.
I swear I had nothing to do with it.
You are so lucky Harvey's here.
Now, clean this place up and crack a window.
My head.
- You're back.
- Yeah, hi.
Hey, new shirt.
- And check out the socks.
- Nice.
- Let's go show them off at the Slicery.
- Actually, come on in.
We need to talk.
- Talk?
- Yeah.
You see, I want us to have a completely honest relationship.
Okay.
And the truth is when I was on my ski vacation, something kind of happened.
Oh?
- I met this amazing guy-- - You did?
But he wasn't as amazing as you.
And going out with him made me realise I like you better.
- Okay, let's go to the Slicery.
- Sabrina.
Since we're being honest, I have something to tell you too.
Really?
What?
If you're ever away and you meet somebody really amazing, but you decide you like me better, don't tell me.
- Deal.
- Deal.
Wow.
No, no, no.
Fellas, you've got it all wrong.
Secret agent?
No, no, no.
I'm an insurance salesman.
Yeah, and in fact I can prove it to you guys.
Here.
Let me just get my notebook out here and I'll crunch some numbers on a term life policy for you.
Now, let's just say that you're a 30-year-old non-smoker with a good job and a decent medical programme.
And your estimated time to die is now.
In your eye, Dr. Cyclops.
Yeah.
Ha, ha.
Boo!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
My incredible sense of smell tells me that's a caramel.
Oh.
Ugh.
- Cherry cordial.
- Really?
Maybe you should get a dog.
I need help.
I don't know what to put on Harvey's valentine.
- What do you have so far?
- "Dear Harvey".
But I don't like it.
I can help you with this one.
Put "You rock my world".
Guys love that.
Maple buttercream.
Yuck.
- Who got chocolates?
- You did.
From Dirk, the mailman.
How sweet.
Yeah, but there are hardly any caramels.
Does this look like one?
- Only one way to find out.
- Sabrina.
- Marzipan.
- Okay, now this one.
- Mm-mm.
- Quit touching them.
Use a spell.
- There.
- That was easy.
Yeah, takes all the mystery out of life.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Watch out for Cupid.
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
Wow, yours is so big.
And yours is so cute.
"Happy Val Day, Sab".
I thought Sab would be a cool nickname for you.
- Really?
- Who am I kidding?
My valentine started out just as big as yours but I kept trying to make it even, and it got smaller and smaller.
But I love it.
It's very symmetrical.
See, that's what I was going for.
I love symmetry.
Things just look nicer that way.
Like your face.
It's really symmetrical.
The bell.
We're late.
To be continued?
Yeah.
Happy Val Day, Sab.
Well, thanks for walking me home.
Maybe I should walk you in.
Make sure you get to the living room okay.
I'd like that.
- Well, here we are.
- We made it.
Um, since you came this far, you wanna stay and hang out?
Sounds like fun.
Okay, wait here.
I'll just go see if my aunts are around.
- Salem, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're in a chat room again pretending to be a woman, aren't you?
- I like the attention.
- Well, say goodbye.
Harvey's here.
You better start acting cattier.
- Mean.
- Where are my aunts?
They went to the Goya exhibit at the museum.
Did you know Zelda was one of his models?
Didn't know, don't care.
- Hey.
- Hm?
- Got anything to eat?
- I was just checking.
- Wow.
Great kitchen.
- Yeah.
Do you like canapÃ©s?
As much as the next guy.
- Let's go back in the living room.
- Oh, I'll grab the cat.
We can make him chase the light reflected off my watch.
No.
Uh, he's not allowed in the living room.
- Very bad shedding problem.
- Really?
Better if he just stays here and minds his own business.
Like I don't have anything better to do than spy on her.
Wait, I don't.
Isn't Annie Leibovitz cool?
She knows everybody.
Oh, look at this one.
Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub of milk.
I wonder if they warmed it before she got in.
I'm sure.
She's a star.
- Whoa.
- What was that?
Uh-oh.
Sparks are flying.
You know, I don't wanna look at this book anymore.
What do you wanna do?
- Kiss you?
- Okay.
No!
- Salem.
- What's with your cat?
- I don't know.
I'll go talk to him.
I mean, feed him.
Ha!
Be right back.
You little sneak.
How dare you?
I can't believe you were spying on me.
And it's a good thing I was.
You can't kiss Harvey.
Just watch me.
And that's a figure of speech.
But something horrible could happen.
Didn't your aunts tell you?
- The sparks were a warning.
- A warning?
Of what?
You shouldn't hear it from your cat.
Just trust me.
Do not kiss Harvey.
Salem, are you being sincere?
Yes.
And it pains me to do it.
Okay, I won't kiss Harvey.
But if you're making this up, I swear you will be neutered.
Slowly.
- Harvey.
- Yeah?
You have to go.
There's an emergency.
- What's wrong?
- My cat's sick.
He needs an operation.
- Can I do anything?
- No, we're gonna use a certified vet.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Maybe we could go to a movie?
Sounds great.
Just great.
- This one's going on the fridge.
How was the museum?
It's so funny.
They're selling postcards of Zelda, nude.
- Well, hello.
- Excuse me, it's art.
And according to that guy in the raincoat who was staring at me, "A masterpiece".
I don't understand why I can't kiss Harvey.
This is what I heard: "Rido-hunti-manned-wicken-ickus, Harvey".
Slow down.
I said, why can't I kiss Harvey?
Got it that time.
Sabrina, have a seat.
We need to talk.
Nothing good ever comes of talking.
You see, when a witch kisses a mortal for the first time, the mortal turns into a frog.
A frog?
Look, if you guys don't like Harvey-- No, no, no, we like him.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be warning you.
If I kiss Harvey, he turns into a frog.
It sounds like something out of a fairy tale.
- They had to get it from somewhere.
- Think they make that stuff up?
- So I can never kiss Harvey?
- Not without transmogrifying him.
That's not a good thing.
My life is ruined.
I hate being a witch.
Oh, no, it's not so bad.
I went through high school without kissing.
Can we come in?
Sure.
Can we turn on the light?
If you must.
We've been doing some research that we think you should know about.
We checked the handbook, and since you're half mortal there's only a 50-50 chance that Harvey will turn into a frog.
So that's good news?
Well, there's a 50 percent chance that it's good news and a 50 percent chance that it's bad.
It's sort of a coin toss.
- Here, flip it.
You'll see what we mean.
- Okay.
Heads he stays Harvey.
Tails he's a frog.
Tails.
Maybe two out of three.
Heads.
- Tails.
Uh!
- Why the "uh"?
Out of a hundred tries, it came up 50 heads and 50 tails.
What are the odds of that happening?
Don't ask me.
I was an English major.
Who could that be?
I'm not expecting company, are you?
It's Harvey, and I look like laundry.
- There.
- Chic.
Hi, what are you doing here?
Don't you remember?
Yesterday, I said I'd see you tomorrow.
- And today's tomorrow.
- Right.
- So you still wanna go to a movie?
- Sure.
Wait.
They keep those theatres kind of dark, don't they?
I'd better go ask my aunt.
Stay here.
Harvey's here and he wants to go to the movies.
What should I do?
See Shine.
Everybody's raving about it.
You know what I mean.
I see no reason why two friends can't go to the movies.
- Right, two friends.
- Just be careful.
Would it help if I gave him a bad-breath spell?
No.
I still have to sit next to him.
Can we crunch those numbers one more time?
I checked with MIT.
They're still 50-50.
Well, let me know if they change.
- All right, let's go.
- Great.
I'm really looking forward to this.
Me too, old buddy, old pal.
So, what kind of movie are you up for?
Something with a lot of random property damage.
- Vindicator 3 just opened.
- Perfect.
Let me help you with that.
They're kind of tricky.
There.
You look really pretty tonight.
Thanks, so do you.
Let's go.
Now, is he the real vindicator or the replicant?
Heads.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
It's not important.
Whoever he is, now he's dead.
Hey.
You look really pretty tonight.
Oh, better get more popcorn.
- Here you go.
- Heads.
All right.
Why do you keep flipping that coin?
Well, if it comes up heads a hundred times in a row, I win a prize.
Tails.
Stupid eagle.
Hey, you know what the best part of that movie was?
The end credits with the Lou Reed song?
No.
Seeing it with you.
Thanks.
You look really pretty tonight.
Muffin?
Well, that was fun.
The best time two friends could have.
Well, nothing left to say, so good night and Godspeed.
Sabrina, can we talk?
What about?
Has something changed between us?
What do you mean?
Well, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but yesterday I got the feeling that you wanted to kiss me.
And today, I feel like you don't.
No, Harvey.
It's just-- See, I-- I can't explain.
It's all right.
You don't have to.
I mean, if that's what you want, we can just befriends.
I think that would be the best for both of us.
All right, I'll walk you to the door.
Man, I really wanted to kiss you.
- Harvey?
- Yeah?
You're still here.
I'll always be here for you, Sab-- I was afraid you'd say that.
- Help!
Help!
What's the matter?
- I turned Harvey into a frog.
- Oh, no.
- You're not helping with that music.
- Sorry.
I thought you were going to just be friends.
I tried but I failed.
And now we're not even the same species.
Well, first things first.
Let's keep him moist.
And secondly, there's still hope.
- Right.
The true-love clause.
- What's that?
There's a test you can take to determine if it's true love.
And if it is, Harvey will change back into a person.
- And if it isn't?
- You'll be changed into a frog.
Aren't those stakes kind of high?
I mean, Harvey's super cute and I really like him, but how am I supposed to know if it's true love?
Do you think about him when he's not around?
- Yeah.
- And does your heart beat faster when you see him walking down the hall?
- Yeah.
- Does it bother when he chews gum?
- No.
- Then it might be true love.
I'm taking the test.
Is it multiple choice?
- Where are we?
The National Institute of Love.
Normally, it's very clinical, but they go all out for Valentine's Day.
Wow, they really take their colour scheme seriously.
I'll sign you in.
Drell should be here any minute.
- Drell gives the test?
- Yeah.
And it's kind of strange us seeing each other today.
The 94th anniversary of our 32nd break-up.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Oh, here he comes.
Hello, ladies.
- And Hilda.
- Drell.
So, Sabrina, you're here to take the test of true love, huh?
- Yes, I am.
- The test is in three parts.
Each one more horrifying than the last.
- Are you scared?
- A little.
Smart.
Now, we have a standard release form here.
The Council is, of course, not responsible for loss of hair, dignity or personal items.
Just sign right here.
If you want collision, initial the box.
Don't fall for that.
It's a rip-off.
- What was that?
- You just signed your life away.
- So you all set?
- Yeah, where do I start?
You start at Door Number 1.
- Good luck.
- Follow your heart.
- Don't let Harvey dry out.
- Come on.
Please welcome Sabrina Spellman.
Oh, what is this?
Part one of your test is The True Love Game.
Here.
Sit down.
Would you like to meet your three Harveys?
"Harveys"?
I like this game.
Gentlemen, let's give your best hellos to Sabrina.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hi, Harveys.
How well do you know the person you think you're in love with?
Let's find out.
And here are the questions.
All right, um, this question is for Harvey Number 2: "If I were a princess trapped in a tower, how would you rescue me"?
Well, the thought of you makes me walk on air, so I'd float right up and whisk you away.
That's sweet.
And Harvey Number 1, what would you do?
Blow up the tower.
Okay.
Um, this question's for Harvey Number 3: "Describe Harvey Number 1's best and worst feature".
- Well, he has really nice sideburns.
- Thanks, man, you too.
- Hey, what about me?
- They're okay.
Come on, guys.
Let's just go on, please?
Okay, this question is for all of you.
"What's your favourite triangle"?
These don't tell me anything.
Nobody said the test would be easy.
Harvey Number 1, your triangle?
- Obtuse.
- And why?
- I don't know.
- Harvey Number 2?
Scalene, definitely scalene.
And Harvey Number 3, what's your favourite kind of triangle?
Equilateral.
I like that it's symmetrical.
That's him.
That's my Harvey.
Harvey Number 3.
That's right, Sabrina, and you've passed part one.
Whoo-hoo!
I passed!
- Congratulations.
- Way to go.
Well, you passed the test of friendship.
True love can't exist without friendship.
They make me say that.
I'm pumped.
What's next?
- Door Number 2.
- Okay.
Wish me luck, Harvey.
Oh, even as a frog, he's cute.
Come on, Harvey.
Let's go check the trellis for bugs.
So, what's new in the life of the most powerful man in the universe?
I finally moved out of my parents' basement.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You were right.
- I should have done it centuries ago.
- I told you.
- So you've got your own place?
- Yeah.
- I'd love to come see it some time.
- Oh, that'd be great.
Especially if you brought some furniture.
Hello?
Anybody?
Is this a test for patience?
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Is anyone sitting here?
- No, go ahead.
Great.
I'm Zak.
- So are you here to take the test?
- Yeah.
I wish they'd hurry.
Uh, could be a while, so you should just relax.
Sun feels good, huh?
Yeah, it's kind of cool to lay by the pool in the middle of February.
Yeah.
You know, those sunglasses are great on you.
You look like a blond Audrey Hepburn.
I love Audrey Hepburn.
Which one of her movies is your favourite?
Well, I'd have to say Sabrina.
I just love the name.
You're kidding.
That's my name.
Oh.
So, Sabrina, are you hungry?
I hadn't thought about it, but I guess maybe a little.
How about a piece of delicious chocolate cake?
- Wow, that looks amazing.
- Oh, it is.
Here, have a little bite.
I don't know.
I had a pretty big muffin earlier.
Oh, come on.
One little taste couldn't hurt.
That's true.
You look really pretty tonight.
Wait, you're trying to make me forget about Harvey, aren't you?
Harvey?
Who's Harvey?
Oh, you're a sly one.
But I can't eat cake when Harvey's in trouble.
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.
- Eat it.
- No.
- That was the test.
You passed.
- I did?
Whoo-hoo!
How about one bite to celebrate?
What do you take me for?
I passed and I got some colour on my cheeks.
Nicely done.
You passed the test of fidelity.
You resisted temptation.
Something that tests every relationship.
- Zelda, do you mind?
This is my gig.
- Sorry.
One more door and we're out of here.
Not so fast.
The next test is really dangerous and our insurance carrier requires that you read this pamphlet.
"So you're going to be a frog"?
I'll go over it with you, honey.
What you thinking?
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.
Can't a guy ask a girl what she's thinking?
I was just wondering, do you think our old flame is still burning?
- Well, there's one way to find out.
- You still have it?
Yeah.
No one bought it at the garage sale.
- It's over here.
- You open it.
I'm afraid to look.
Yes, the old flame is still burning.
After all these years.
You could warm soup over it.
Maybe what we had was special.
- I'm gonna take the test of true love.
- For me?
- For us.
- I'll be waiting.
Maybe this could be the beginning of something wonderful.
Drell, you rock my world.
I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl.
Say hello to Hilda Spellman.
Groovy.
All right, guys, give your best hello to Hilda.
Hi, Hilda.
- Hilda, baby.
- Yo, Hilda.
Hi, Drell.
I think I already know.
- Cool your jets.
That's not how we play.
- Sorry.
Drell Number 2, "If you were a condiment what would you be"?
- Stupid question.
- Ketchup, ketchup.
Say ketchup.
Mustard, so I could spice up your life.
That's him.
That's my Drell.
Incorrect.
Game's over.
- Number 3?
- No.
- Number 1?
- I said it's over.
- No, it's not.
- Security.
- What, no canned applause?
- Sorry.
I finished the pamphlet.
So you decided what kind of frog you wanna be?
- Yeah, I selected the flying tree frog.
- Excellent choice.
Then it's time for the last test.
But this one isn't easy, like the others.
Good luck and don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I mean, I know it's true love, so therefore, I have no reason to be nervous.
Push.
Don't pull.
Push.
- Hello, is anybody here?
Sabrina?
Harvey, where are you?
I'm not sure.
It's dark in here.
See if you can find a light switch.
Wait, here's one.
I don't like this.
What's going on?
It's a test of faith.
You have to get to me.
Does the Safe Road come out anywhere near you?
No, I think it dead-ends in the suburbs.
Then there's only one way.
Scared.
Hot.
Really scared.
Really hot.
Stand back!
It's not worth it!
Yes, it is.
I can do this.
I made it.
Oh, Harvey.
All that for a hologram?
I did it.
I passed.
It is true love.
Oh, Sabrina, that's wonderful.
I have to admit.
I had my doubts, but now I can shout it to the world I have a true love.
Oh, rub it in.
Take your frog and go.
But I passed.
Why is Harvey still a frog?
There's one final detail.
To change him back, you have to return to the scene of the kiss - and kiss him again.
- I have to kiss a frog?
That is so gross.
Teenagers.
They'll jump through flames, but ask them to kiss a frog - Would you go?
- Come on.
- Wait, where's Aunt Hilda?
- Shh.
Don't ask.
Mm.
Zak, this pecan pie is fabulous.
It's ever better than the cheesecake.
Is that meringue?
Your lips are all slimy.
It worked.
That was great.
Oh, I know.
That's why I've been trying to kiss you all night.
Could we try it again?
I think I might enjoy it more this time.
Me too.
I have to admit, I was pretty nervous.
Aren't they cute?
Yeah.
I'm glad she passed.
But I still can't believe you let her take that risk.
- There was no risk.
I knew she'd pass.
- You did?
At 16, it's always true love.
Why didn't you tell her?
Because now, she thinks it's extra special.
- Hi, Sab.
- Harvey.
I just found out I don't have basketball practise, so if you want, I can give you a ride home.
And miss getting stuff thrown at me on the bus?
Hmm.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Then I'll meet you here at 3:30.
- Great.
- See you.
- See you.
- Harvey.
- Yeah?
It's kind of too bad you don't have basketball practise today.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Those fingers in my hair That sly come-hither stare That strips my conscience bare It's witchcraft - Salem, did I hear you singing?
- No, I was just-- It's okay.
I came in because it sounded good.
Oh, come on.
I'm no-- You think?
- Yeah, I just wanted a front row seat.
- Me too.
- Right behind you.
- Well, well, well.
- Old Yellow Eyes, you still got it.
- Hit it, cat.
And I've got no defence for it The heat is too intense for it What good would Common sense for it do?
Hairball.
Hairball.
Safari, so goodie.
It's an interesting theory, but I don't think there's a force field around this table.
Then why isn't anyone signing up to adopt a grandparent?
Do you think it's clear that these adoptions are not legally binding?
Hey, guys.
Libby, can I sign you up for the Adopt-a-Grandparent programme?
Actually, I came here to tell you guys about my new community service.
It's the Adopt-a-Life programme.
May I sign you up?
- Don't answer, trick question.
- See you, freak.
Frizzy freak.
Frizzy?
These happen to be curls.
Let it go, Jenny.
Take the high road.
What's going on?
Some foreign exchange students are sitting at our table.
Deport them.
What's with your socks?
Did you get dressed in the dark this morning?
No.
How did this happen?
- Quick, switch socks with each other.
- What?
I need a trend and I need it now.
Hey, Harvey, over here.
We need you to sign up.
I did on my way in.
Yeah, but nobody else has, so could you do it again and do it loudly?
All right.
Sure, I'd love to adopt a grandparent.
Old people are so much fun.
They know tons of stuff and sometimes they give you money.
Shh!
Don't go there.
Well, at least we filled the sign-up sheet.
Yeah, but it's all Harvey and Mighty Mouse.
- So then my dance instructor said-- - Hey, look at her.
She matches.
- What are you making?
- Hair soup.
I thought long tresses would look nice for a change.
Hmm, tastes really wavy.
Sorry I'm late.
It took longer at the bookstore than I expected.
- Did you get me Cat Fancy?
- Yes.
- Salem, here's your New Republic.
- Thanks.
I hate the politics, but Brustein on the theatre is a revelation.
- Why do you keep smiling?
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.
- Do not.
Fine, don't tell me.
I can always twist your arm.
Cut it out.
Oh, you.
- Ow.
You're pulling my ear.
- Let go of my arm.
- Let go of my ear.
- Enough.
Okay, I'll tell you.
I met a guy at the bookstore.
Oh, really?
What was his pick-up line?
He didn't have one.
He mistook me for an employee and asked if we carried any books on how to meet intelligent women.
Mm-hm.
- Do you think you'll see him again?
- He took my number.
But it wasn't a pick up.
Soup's on.
- You want some?
- Just a smidge in the bowl.
How about you, Zelda?
It's hair soup.
No, thanks.
I just got mine cut.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Oh, yuck.
There's a hair in my hair soup.
Of course I remember you, Rick.
No, I'm still here.
- What's she smiling about?
- A boy.
Hold on, Rick.
I'm gonna grab the cordless.
You were saying?
You want some hair soup?
It's really thick and luxurious.
No, thanks.
I'm on my way to the senior centre.
But I should probably bring something.
Chewy caramels.
That's perfect.
This is already better than visiting my real grandparents.
I don't have to take my earrings out.
How do we know which one to choose?
I see mine.
I see mine.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is kind of awkward, but would you like to be my grandmother?
Of course.
That would be lovely.
But before I start bragging about you, I need to know your name.
I'm Sabrina.
And what's yours?
- You can call me Nana.
- Great.
An awkward silence.
It's like we really are family.
Here, how about looking at my scrapbook.
Wow, awesome photo of Elijah Wood.
Oh, he's my little honey.
- You know him?
- Noah Wyle introduced us.
You know Noah Wyle?
Only through Christian Slater.
I love Christian Slater.
How do you know these people?
Well, when you get to be my age, you know just about everybody.
Howard?
Did you come to adopt a grandparent?
No, I'm here to take a photo for the school paper.
We're doing an article on community service.
It's called "Westbridge Cares".
But apparently not that much.
I'll go set up.
Excellent timing.
The photo will be great publicity for the programme.
Yeah, I only wish we could have gotten someone cool to be here.
- Thanks a lot.
- You know what I mean.
Someone who others follow.
Like Libby, the Lord High Empress of Westbridge?
I thought she was sophomore class president.
Libby would never show her face here.
Maybe we could fake it.
My dad says that Russia's on their third Boris Yeltsin.
Oh, come on.
You can't fake a person.
Of course you can't.
Gotta go.
This is the worst thing I've ever had to do.
Ew.
- All right, I'm here.
- Libby.
What are you doing at the senior centre?
I thought I'd stop by and improve your image.
You're gonna help us?
Look, I know I'm completely shallow and self-absorbed, but every now and then I think of others.
All set.
If you could stand together.
No problem.
How's this?
You mean, next to you?
- Sure.
- Smile.
Now put that on the front page, and remember, old people are the coolest.
You can quote me on that.
I will.
Thanks, Libby.
What a scoop.
Now that the reporter's gone, I guess I'll go too.
Bye.
Did you see that?
Libby treated me like a human.
I'm glad we took a picture.
Sabrina's gonna think we pulled a Yeltsin.
Hey, what's up?
Libby was just here.
No.
Well, that ought to get kids involved.
Sabrina, look, the senior-centre photo made the front page.
Cool.
Has Libby seen this?
What is this?
A photo of you standing next to Jenny.
I would not.
This is a fake.
They must have put my face on someone else's body, and not a very good one.
But it quotes you as saying, "Old people are the coolest".
No, cheerleaders are the coolest.
Harvey, you were at the senior centre.
You didn't see me there, right?
Libby, you did a good thing.
Deal with it.
I've been framed.
What's with her?
How can she not remember?
Isn't it obvious?
Libby has multiple personalities, and we finally met the nice one.
Now, today we're gonna be studying sight, and there's more to this subject than meets the eye.
- Mr. Pool?
- Yeah?
Before you begin, I'd like to make an announcement regarding the front page of the school newspaper.
You know what?
I noticed that myself.
And may I say, I was proud to have all three outstanding citizens in my class.
Libby, Harvey, Jenny.
You are the hope of America.
Now, let's hear it for these everyday heroes, huh?
What was it you wanted to say, Libby?
Nothing.
We'll be at the senior centre again today if anyone else wants to join us.
Us?
I don't recall seeing you there, Sabrina.
Hey.
- Hi.
- I see the hair spell kicked in.
I probably shouldn't have had that second bowl of hair soup, but I thought muttonchops would be nice for a change.
You look like Gregg Allman.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- So how was your date with Rick?
- Oh, not so good.
I'm starting to feel really weird about the age difference.
Normally I don't care about these things, but Rick keeps bringing up stuff that makes me feel old.
- Like what?
- Oh, he keeps talking about how he can't wait for the turn of the century.
Big deal.
I've done that five times.
Oh, and it's always the same.
I've partied like it was 1699, This time I'm staying home.
Exactly.
I think I'm gonna break off our relationship.
Oh, you haven't even given him a chance.
You grow a little facial hair, and suddenly you're on his side.
Hey, look at me.
I'm a hippie cat.
Try some fudge.
Pete Sampras sent it to me.
And who sent you the Turtles, Chris O'Donnell?
No.
Leonardo DiCaprio.
Mm.
Then I'll have one of these.
Oh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Guys, where are you going?
You gotta pick out a grandparent while they last.
No, thanks, we only came because we thought Libby would be here.
- And she's not, so we're going.
- But you can't go.
We need people, and maybe Libby will come.
In fact, I'm sure Libby will come.
Oh, I think I see her in the hall now.
Oh, man.
Not again.
Oh, stupid Libby.
- Hi, guys.
- Libby, you made it.
Sabrina told me you were thinking of taking off.
- No.
- Old people are the coolest.
You got that right.
Oh, hey, there's Jenny.
Hi, Jenny.
How's it going?
Good.
Nana, Sabrina had to run out for a minute so she asked me to take over.
- I'm Libby.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Turtle?
Mr. Berry, are you sure you wanna do that?
Well, I admit leaving my king unprotected is a somewhat risky strategy, but I think I know what I'm doing.
Well, you beat me 10 times in a row, I'm not gonna argue with you.
- Hey, checkmate.
- How about that.
It's time for a victory soda.
Libby?
- Yeah, Harvey.
- Can I get you a soda?
Sure, I'd love a ginger ale.
Harvey.
You must have been thirsty if you couldn't wait for me to bring it back.
- Here you go.
- What's this?
- It's your soda.
- Ginger ale?
What kind of freak drink is that?
I only drink diet.
- But you asked for this.
- No, I didn't.
Now move.
I'll get my own soda.
You know, I think I liked your other personality better, even if she does pick her nose.
Hey, I got an extra soda.
Do you want it?
I never turn down a free drink.
Harvey, where's my soda?
- You said you didn't want it.
- When?
You called it a freak drink.
I would not.
Yes, I would.
Gotta go.
Oh, stupid old people's soda machine.
Sorry, sir.
I need the phone.
If you have a problem with that, my name is Libby.
Shut the door.
- Finally.
- Hi, Libby, you made it.
This stupid machine gave me ginger ale.
I won't drink this.
I will, thanks.
All right, I'm here.
Isn't anyone going to say hi?
- We already did.
- When you first came in.
I did just come in.
This isn't funny anymore.
What are you doing with that old lady?
That's the way the programme works.
You select a grandparent and spend time with them.
- And what's the catch?
- There isn't a catch.
You get the satisfaction of doing something nice.
Libby.
Libby.
I guess I'll go with her since she already seems to know me.
Isn't it great?
Look, everyone has someone.
I know.
It's working better than I imagined.
- And it's all thanks to Libby.
- Libby?
You know, deep down, she's a really good person.
I wouldn't go that far.
I mean, I'm sure Libby can be nice on rare occasions when I'm not around.
But most of the time, Libby's just Libby.
Oh, Sabrina.
If only you could have seen the way she waved at me.
But I did.
It was like this: You are not.
I'm the world's biggest Johnny Depp fan.
Hey, what's up?
- May we help you?
- I just wanted to talk to Nana.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
She's my nana now.
- Aunt Hilda, you got a sec?
- Yeah.
I have a problem.
I'm yours.
I always have time for girl talk.
This isn't about boys.
This is about Libby.
Is she being mean again?
No, she's being nice.
It's just as bad.
You see, Jenny and I started this Adopt-a-Grandparent programme.
- Uh-huh.
- And then Libby got involved and now she's queen of the senior centre.
- Why does she always have to win?
- Sabrina, charity's not a contest.
It sounds like when Libby wins, everybody wins.
Not me.
I lost.
She stole my adopted grandmother.
- Then why don't you get a new one?
- Because all the good ones are taken.
Just wait.
People get old all the time.
And remember, virtue is its own reward.
Thanks for the advice.
Now can I give you some?
Get some tattoos, you'll work forever.
It's not fair.
She was mine first.
Not that I don't enjoy getting to know you, Mrs. Hardell.
So James Michener's Hawaii.
Now, what's this about?
You make it sound like so much fun, Mr. Berry.
Why did they call it the Depression?
Not everybody liked apples as much as I did.
So tell me more about Ethan Hawke.
Oh, he's a nice boy.
Does he ever come to visit?
When I call him.
Well, what are you waiting for?
"Poi is made from taro root".
Isn't that fascinating?
I'll read on.
Hi, Sabrina.
I was getting sodas for me and nana.
That's nice.
I'm going home.
So soon?
Why?
Well, I've been here two hours and Mrs. Hardell woke up just long enough to tell me why foreigners are ruining this country, and then she went back to sleep.
Oh, too bad.
Nana and I are having the best time.
In fact, I think this project may turn out to be very rewarding.
I should thank you for that, Sabrina.
You're thanking me?
Well, I'd better go back in now.
I don't wanna keep my nana waiting.
Ha.
Would you initial here, sir?
Thank you.
And it's ma'am.
- Who was that?
- More flowers.
Rick is not giving up easily.
He is one determined young man.
But not so young as to make a relationship impossible.
They are beautiful, aren't they?
Zeldie, do what you want, but my female intuition tells me you still like this guy.
And if that's true, you shouldn't let age get in the way.
You're as young as you feel.
I'm 612.
- Do I look it?
- Well, the beard makes you look older.
But you might be right.
There's a lot of stuff about Rick I like, and maybe he'll mature.
I think I'll call him.
Oh, and Hilda, thanks for caring.
That's what sisters are for.
Wait, oh.
Ow.
Don't pull.
And so the outer ear channels the sound waves to the eardrum, which picks up the vibrations.
Then three tiny bones in the middle ear carry the movement to the cochlea, which is filled with fluid and cells with tiny hairs that move, and do you think I can't hear you whispering?
Come on, I've got three tiny bones in my ear.
Now, does somebody wanna tell me what this is about?
Libby's gonna meet Ethan Hawke?
How do you know him?
He's a friend of a friend.
You do a good deed, you get a little back.
- What's so funny?
- Oh, um, the word cochlea.
You were laughing at me in class, weren't you?
- I wasn't.
- You were.
- No, I wasn't.
- I've laughed at enough people to know when I'm being laughed at.
Okay, I was, but just because I never thought you'd be so gullible.
Gullible?
You wanna tell me what you mean by that?
Quietly?
Let's see.
How could I put this nicely?
Oh, I can't.
Nana's whacked.
Look, she doesn't know Pete, she doesn't know Keanu, she doesn't know Noah and she doesn't know Brad.
Yes, she does.
I've seen the scrapbook.
So have I. It's all cut-outs from magazines, but have you seen any real proof?
She has a Johnny Mnemonic T-shirt.
Look, I fell for it too.
I mean, who wouldn't?
Until the DiCaprio Turtles.
You mean, Leonardo didn't make this?
Eat it.
Let the sugar comfort you.
Then all the time I spent with Nana has been a total waste.
No.
You made a dear old woman happy.
Oh, please.
If I could sue, I would.
Look, why don't you just forget about it?
How?
It was just announced to the whole class, which means it will spread to the entire school, which is what I wanted when I thought I was gonna meet Ethan.
- Libby, you're getting all red.
- I'm so humiliated.
- She's not gonna get away with this.
- What is that supposed to mean?
After school, I'm going to the senior centre and rip Nana a new afghan.
Look, leave her alone.
Why don't you take it out on me?
You love doing that.
I wanna talk to you.
Libby, what a pleasant surprise.
Sit down, Nana.
If that is your real name.
What's wrong?
You seem upset.
I am upset.
You said I was going to meet Ethan Hawke.
- Well, you're not.
- So you lied to me?
Oh, that's a little harsh.
In my day, we called them tall tales.
You have no idea what you've done, do you?
Not really.
I'm going to be teased about this for weeks.
And then again every time a new Ethan Hawke movie comes out.
I mean, my only hope is his career takes a total nosedive, which means I have to root against him and I really cared.
- Sorry.
- Sorry is not enough.
You did a number on me.
I hope you're happy, you lying, sad, - pathetic, old woman.
- Libby.
Libby.
Libby.
I never meant to hurt you.
Ooh.
She was mad.
Sabrina, you're right.
I thoroughly enjoyed my walk.
Well, a little fresh air always does one good.
So is it just you and me or will Libby be stopping by?
Oh, I don't think you'll see her around here again.
She made up with her real grandmother.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'll miss her.
She's such a sweet girl.
Nana, you're an excellent judge of character.
Do you wanna catch a movie?
Sure, we'll go see one of your friends.
I think Ethan Hawke has a new movie out.
- He called.
- Oh, what did he say?
Asked all about you.
- Hi.
- Hey, where have you been?
Nana and I went to see the new Ethan Hawke movie.
It's gonna be huge.
Hey, you shaved your beard.
Yeah, the upkeep was too much.
And the weirdest guys kept coming on to me.
Oh, you nut.
- Who's Aunt Zelda with?
Rick.
The younger man is back in the picture.
I've gotta check this out.
Pardon me.
- Mr. Berry?
- Sabrina?
- You know each other?
- Yes, from the senior centre.
What a small world.
Sabrina is my niece.
You look too young to be her aunt.
Oh, Rick.
I'll leave you two alone.
Hey, Salem, you wanna--?
Whoa!
What happened to you?
Too much soup.
Groom me.
Please, groom me.
Hey, Zelda, did you have some of the tuna noodle casserole I put in the fridge last night?
- No, why?
- Somebody took a big chunk out of it.
- I'd check with Salem.
- Right.
Tuna.
Well, he'll regret that.
- I threw in the leftover soup.
- You didn't.
Yes.
I know it has horrible side effects, but I just hate throwing away food.
- Good morning.
What?
What?
- Not Salem.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Please be home.
Please, please, please.
Should I?
Please answer.
I don't know.
Oh, all right.
- Hello.
- Aunt Hilda, I'm so glad you're home.
I left my history book on the counter.
- Do you see it?
- Yes, it's right here where you left it.
- Can you send it to me?
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
- Stand back.
Oops.
- What happened?
- I sneezed.
- So where's my book?
- I don't know, but I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.
This is my biggest fan.
I just don't get why they're making us read 1984 when Orwell got so much wrong.
Hey, guys.
I'm selling tickets for the sophomore class trip to Funland.
- Do you wanna go?
- Sure.
Funland sounds like fun.
How much?
- Forty bucks.
- Whoa.
- Who has that kind of money?
- I do.
The deadline's the end of next week, so let me know.
I can tell her right now.
I'll never be able to dig up that much cash.
Me neither.
Plus I can't ask my aunts, they're on a "teach her the value of a dollar" kick.
- What made them do that?
- I went on a "blow my allowance on dumb stuff" kick.
And while I was on hold, I realised I need one of those shoe buffers.
- I'm sorry, sir.
You're maxed out.
- Maxed out?
But that's impossible.
I demand to speak with your-- Hello?
Hello?
- Salem, what's going on?
- I don't believe it.
I just had my credit card yanked.
- You have a credit card?
- Yes.
I was pre-approved by the good people of the Bank of Newark.
Now I'm a little over-extended.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- I appreciate your concern.
- No, I was gonna hit you up for a loan.
- And I was gonna ask you for money.
- How ironic.
We're doomed.
I guess we're gonna have to get jobs.
Coming.
- Me again.
- Hello, Dirk.
Sorry to disturb you, Ms. Zelda P. Spellman.
But I just finished my rounds when I discovered a straggler in the bottom of my bag.
- For you.
- Thanks.
- Thought it might be important.
- I've been pre-approved by the Bank of Newark.
Say, I saw you talking to a FedEx guy the other day.
Is there something I should know about?
He was just dropping off a package.
Yeah, I don't trust those guys.
You know, it's not natural for mail to move that fast.
I agree.
And now it's very important that I close the door.
He has really got it bad for you.
I wish there was some gentle way to let him down.
I know what you need.
I just saw an ad for it in Modern Witch.
It's a new perfume that repels love.
Here it is.
"Somewhere between disdain and contempt lies Revulsion".
Revulsion?
Hmm.
"Available at Full Moon Beauty Supply".
- Let's go.
- We can't.
Full Moon Beauty Supply - is only open once a month.
- When?
During the full moon.
- I knew that.
Accountant?
No.
Crane operator?
No.
Systems analyst?
Hey, I can do that.
Good system.
Bad system.
I think you need to know something about computers.
Hold everything.
Look at this.
"Greater Boston Cat Show.
Grand prize $500".
A cat show?
I can't see you in a cat show.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
- Of course.
- Then get an application.
- This is our chance for a quick score.
- All right.
Okay, name, Salem Spellman.
May I remind you I'm your cat, not your pet.
- I have my own last name.
- You do?
Saberhagen.
Salem Saberhagen.
- And what breed are you?
- American Shorthair.
And darn proud of it.
Write that down.
The judges will eat that up.
That's all we need, except for the $5 application fee.
Don't look at me.
I'm maxed out.
Would you sign me in?
I'm gonna grab the last cage.
Sure.
It's Saberhagen, right?
Right.
Here you go.
- Are you comfortable?
- I feel like a caged animal in here.
- Look at all these losers.
- Hey, you better behave yourself.
- I will.
- You always say that, but-- If people see me talking to my cat, they'll think I'm nuts.
- Look around.
Yes, you are.
- Yes, you are.
- You wanna be a winner, think like a winner.
Okay, we can talk all we want.
Hello.
What a pretty cat.
Oh, no ribbons?
- This is our first show.
- Duke has won quite a few times.
- See?
- It's nice of your cat - to let you wear them.
- Oh, yes.
He's a Burmese, you know.
- What's yours?
- An American Shorthair.
And darn proud of it.
Well, the Burmese judging is up first, so we'd better go finish grooming.
Unbelievable.
Did you see that?
Her cat had whisker extensions.
- How could you tell?
- It's so obvious.
I got you a good number, 38.
Excellent.
Lucky 38.
Hey, isn't that Bob Gordon, the Channel 8 news guy?
Yeah.
I guess he's the judge.
Welcome to the Greater Boston Cat Show.
I'm Bob Gordon.
Today, I will be selecting for Best of Breed.
Those winners will stay overnight and tomorrow be judged for Best of Show.
I hope you're all prepared for a thorough and perhaps even gruelling competition.
- Psst.
Sabrina.
- Yeah.
Get the brush.
I'm shedding like crazy.
- What is he looking for?
- To see if it's a boy or a girl?
This cat has excellent bone structure, a lovely coat, and a somewhat bemused expression.
This is one of my top three American Shorthairs.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Congratulations.
Now, let's begin the parade of semi-finalists.
- Parade?
- Watch out for Andrew, - he'll try to trip you.
- Watch out for Mrs. Ericson, - she plays head games.
- Watch out for Haley, she's paranoid.
Here we go.
This is the cheesiest thing I've ever done.
Smile.
- Hey.
- Did I step on your shoe?
How am I supposed to choose?
Do you mind if I take off?
I'm bored out of my skull.
Go ahead.
My aunts can pick me up.
This was fun.
Now we will begin the one-on-one interviews.
What can you tell me about Salem's temperament?
Well, he's very friendly, very focused, and just a little power mad.
- Sounds like he's all cat.
- Right.
And he's got a real head for numbers.
May I demonstrate?
Ask him a simple multiplication question.
Okay.
Salem, uh, what's seven times five?
Amazing.
Although we do judge purely on appearance.
Isn't that life.
Will all of our semi-finalists please bring their cats forward.
I will now announce my Best of Breed decisions.
And this is my first place American Shorthair.
And darn proud of it.
Come on, Hilda.
Full moon.
Let's go.
Coming.
Relax, you'll get your Revulsion.
Oh, I hope it works.
I don't want Dirk to go after the UPS guy again.
Hello.
Welcome to Full Moon Beauty Supply.
- May I help you?
- I need a bottle of Revulsion.
Ah!
Someone's bothering you.
A little or a lot?
- Well-- - Oh, get the big one.
A pretty girl like you needs a lot of Revulsion.
- Oh, what's this?
- Oh, this is a magic mirror that shows you at your best.
"The makeover mirror.
It's a nice reflection on you".
Try it.
I'm ravishing.
- I have to have it.
- Oh, here, buy two.
- One for each of you.
- No.
Hilda, you can't buy self-esteem.
Yes, I can, and it's on sale.
Try some wrinkle berries.
They smooth out your face and other places.
Here, I give you half a pound.
No, thank you.
We can shop for ourselves.
Fine.
Oh, stress mints.
I wonder if they work.
Careful, it says no samples.
I can read.
- Hilda, what have you done?
- I didn't do anything.
Aha!
My "no samples" spell works.
I couldn't help myself.
Change me back, please.
Okay, but first, you'll pay for the stress mints, and then you'll buy a sample antidote, and then you'll buy a gift certificate.
Oh, sure.
Stick it to the little guy.
Today, Best of Breed.
Tomorrow, Best of Show.
You should be very proud, Salem.
Okay, here's your milk, and The Economist.
Now, I have to go call my aunts.
I guess we're closing down the place.
- Excuse me.
- Gotta go.
Hello.
Who is this?
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Hm?
In the briefcase?
Oh, dear Lord.
Where did you get this photo?
Name your price.
I'll pay you anything.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it?
No, no, no.
No problem.
You just keep those negatives to yourself, and I promise your cat will be named Best of Show.
- Good night again, Mr. Gordon.
- Out of my way.
- What's with him?
- The contest is fixed.
The judge is being blackmailed with an incriminating photo.
- You're kidding.
Of what?
- I don't know.
He took it into his office.
- I'll go check.
- I'll stay here.
There it is.
Incredible.
- If people only knew.
I thought I closed that.
Meow.
Meow!
Oh, no.
Kitty.
Kitty.
How did you get in here?
Okay.
There you go.
There you go.
Oh, you are a pretty little kitty.
Too bad you don't have a chance.
Salem.
- Sabrina, where are you?
Next to you.
In a cage.
Salem, this is awful.
If I can't point, I can't turn myself back.
- What was that?
What?
- There's something in here with me.
What?
Oh, it's just my tail.
Hello?
Sabrina?
Are you in here?
Yes, next to Salem.
Sabrina?
Hi.
Or should I say meow?
Oh, look how cute the little blond kitty is.
I have claws, and I will use them.
- Now, change me back.
- Here you go.
Oh.
Help me, Hilda.
That feels so much--  - Change the rest of me.
- Sorry.
- Now, what is going on?
- I'll explain everything, but right now I really have to get home and brush my teeth.
Another hairball.
And to think they call Bob Gordon the most trusted name in New England news.
Who'd have thought the cat show would be a cauldron of corruption.
Don't give up.
All you have to do is figure out who the blackmailer is.
The problem is everyone has a motive.
Everyone wants to win.
But only the blackmailer took this picture.
A reverse-angle spell will tell us who that is.
There, and the blackmailer is A person wearing a loose robe, obscured by a shadow, with a big camera covering his, or her, face.
Must be some distinguishing characteristic.
All you can see is the right hand and-- Wait a sec.
Does that look like a whole finger to you?
No.
Whoever took this photo is missing half an index finger.
And that's who your blackmailer is.
- So it's not over?
- Not even close.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go meet and greet.
- Did I just do a cat thing?
- Yeah.
Good morning, I just wanted to wish you good luck.
- May the best cat win.
- You mean my Duke.
Thanks.
Oh.
Uh, what a nice grooming mitt.
- May I see it?
- Get your own.
You're the competition.
Haley, I just wanted to say it's been really great getting to know you.
I don't touch people.
- How goes the investigation?
- Not good.
My three prime suspects are all cleverly concealing their hands.
I know how to fix that.
Mini quiches.
No one can resist them.
- Oh, looks good.
- Those aren't for you.
They're for the blackmailer.
Free quiche.
Help yourselves.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Well, maybe just one.
I did skip breakfast.
Well, look at that.
I thought I was the only one.
This is amazing.
- Shop glass?
- Farm accident.
- Used to keep wolverines.
- We should start a support group.
Oh, thanks for the quiche.
It's over, Salem.
The blackmailer has the perfect cover.
Then take me home.
I wanna enjoy something pure.
Like harness racing.
He's not gonna get away with this.
Mr. Gordon?
I need to talk to you right away.
I'm about to make the Best of Show presentation.
- It can wait.
- Pushy.
Like a young Diane Sawyer.
What is it?
I know you're being blackmailed.
I saw the photo, and I know your secret.
So, what do you want?
Second place?
No.
Look, don't give into them.
Come clean.
You don't have to hide the fact that you're-- - Don't say it.
- Bald.
Shh!
You have no idea what this means.
- It could destroy my career.
- How?
Aren't honesty and integrity the most important things to a journalist?
Not in this decade.
People like people with hair.
They've done studies.
The public hasn't trusted a bald man since Eisenhower.
But they believe in you, and you're not playing fair.
You wanna talk about fair?
I wore a toupee to my first frat party.
Don't talk to me about fair.
Sabrina, I didn't wanna miss Salem's big showdown.
- I'm not late, am I?
- You didn't miss anything, except confirmation we live in a rotten, crooked, corrupt, stinking world.
Good.
The moment we've all been waiting for has arrived.
What does it take to be a championship cat?
Mrs. Ericson, may I please see Duke?
- So that's who the blackmailer is.
- Duke is a fine, superb cat.
Note the tail, the bone structure, the excellent tension in the whiskers.
What-- What is this?
That cat has whisker extensions.
- Those are illegal.
- No, they're not.
I checked the rulebook very carefully, there's nothing wrong with whisker extensions.
Absolutely.
If Mrs. Ericson would like to glue bits of hair onto her animal to improve its image, she can.
It may seem a little desperate, a little silly, a little vain, but who are we to--?
Oh, dear Lord, it's like looking into a mirror.
It's time to come clean.
Our top story tonight is this.
- He's bald.
- None of you saw this.
- Stop, it's over.
- No, it's just the beginning.
Mr. Gordon thought he needed this to gain people's trust.
But trust should not depend on fake hair.
Trust should depend on real knowledge, integrity, and accurate reporting.
Sabrina, he's on TV news.
Still, we should all applaud this man who has stood before us and bared his naked head.
Thank you.
Big deal.
Now, can we get on with the competition?
Who won Best of Show?
Duke did.
He was already announced the winner.
I take it back.
I'm disqualifying you for attempting to influence a cat-show official, and that is in the rulebook.
You don't understand.
Duke is getting older.
He's not as pretty as he used to be.
Oh, God, I miss my youth.
Talk about cracking under the pressure.
Enough about people.
Who's the best cat?
The truth makes that decision easy.
This weekend, I have met a rare and extraordinary cat.
A cat unlike any other.
Where is Salem Saberhagen?
Oh, my God.
Everything's in slow motion.
Now, here is a cat who is not only attractive but intelligent.
And I would like to award it the first prize blue ribbon-- Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
There is another cat.
The most beautiful little kitty that I have ever seen.
- Where is that blond cat?
- What blond cat?
Wait a sec.
I know where she is.
What is she doing?
Her cat was about to win.
Don't worry, Harvey, Sabrina always lands on her feet.
Pretend I belong to you.
Is this the cat you're looking for?
Why, yes.
What's her name?
- Sabrina.
- She named her cat Sabrina?
Doesn't that get confusing around the house?
It's a pretty confusing place in general.
I am pleased and proud to announce, and with the utmost integrity, that this blond cat is Best of Show Grand Champion.
Whoo-hoo!
I was so close.
- No, Harvey, she's not for sale.
- Are you sure?
She's the sweetest, most beautiful cat I've ever held.
- All set.
- What did you do?
I felt bad for Bob Gordon, so I left a little present in his office.
Let's check out the damage.
Oh, my.
I look fabulous.
Bobby baby, Bobby boubie.
I'm Bob Gordon, and this is Eyewitness Action News Center 8.
- Salem?
Meow.
- Come on, Salem.
- Meow, meow.
You have to talk to me some time.
I've got your chin.
Oh, that feels good.
Wait, I'm still mad at you.
- I can't believe you did that to me.
- I said I was sorry.
My vanity took over.
But it all worked out fine.
Harvey and I get to go to Funland, and I promise to pay off your debt.
- I guess the money is all that matters.
- No, it's not.
And that's why you should have this.
The blue ribbon?
You deserve it.
After all, you are the best cat.
- Salem?
- Just got a little something in my eye.
Dirk, I was hoping you'd stop by today.
I brought your mail, and some Omaha Steaks I found in the unclaimed mailroom.
How thoughtful.
Hey, would you like to come in for a cup of coffee?
I'd like that.
Wow, it's really happening.
- Do you take cream and sugar?
- Yes, please.
Hey, you're reading the magazine I brought you.
Yes, and I'm paying the bills you brought me too.
I'm sorry about those.
Enough shoptalk.
See, Zelda, my interest in you is not purely professional.
You are no mere occupant to me.
You're the bright spot on my route.
Can you meet my parents this Sunday?
I think first you should get to know the real me.
I think I know you pretty well.
Here's your coffee.
Thanks.
You a little tired?
I'm exhausted.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Sabrina, are you growling like a bear?
- I can't get this jar open.
- I'll do it.
It's all in the wrist.
Oh, man, that's on tight.
It's like they're afraid the sauce will fall into the wrong hands.
- What's up?
- We can't get this jar open.
Don't you know the trick?
Here, you whack it lightly to break the seal, and there.
See, it's not so easy.
- Well, then use magic.
- Good idea.
The finger is mightier than the wrist.
That should do it.
Ugh!
What is wrong with this jar?
I give up.
You know, it's great having supernatural powers, but for some things, we could really use a man around the house.
Free electrons, while they last.
I'll be there around dinnertime.
Anything special you wanna do this weekend?
- Maybe we could go to the ice show.
- If that's what you want.
- And maybe we could invite Harvey.
- What a great idea.
Uh-oh.
That sounded too enthusiastic.
Forget I said anything.
- Come on, I really wanna meet him.
- But you can't make a big deal out of it.
I won't.
It'll just be a casual meeting between a father and his daughter's first serious boyfriend.
I'm glad you understand.
I gotta get to school.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- See you.
- Good morning.
- You're running late.
Dad and I were trying to figure out our weekend plans.
You wanna go to the ice show tomorrow?
Oh, I don't think so.
There'll be little flashlights.
- Definitely not.
- Okay.
Then it's just me, Dad and Harvey.
Harvey and Ted are meeting?
You didn't say that.
Now, that's a show worth seeing.
Too bad.
You already said no.
That'd be fine.
I'd love to meet your father.
Oh, man, I should have worn an undershirt.
- I promise you will get along great.
- Does he like sports?
- No.
- Does he know anything about cars?
- No.
- Military aircraft?
I'm sure you'll find something to talk about.
- We could talk about you.
- No.
Fine.
Don't say hi.
Sorry, Salem.
I'm just so excited about seeing my dad.
- Has it been a month already?
- Yeah.
- But today's Tuesday, right?
- No, Friday.
Man, I was way off.
- Is Dad here yet?
- No.
What's going on?
Hilda's still trying to open that jar of spaghetti sauce.
Oh!
I think I've got it this time.
Watch.
Don't watch.
Give it up.
Ted will be here soon, and he'll open it.
- Why, because he's a man?
- Well, yes.
- That is so sexist.
- Men happen to have more upper-- Just because he's a man-- TED : That's enough now, the both of you.
Don't make me use the voice.
- Dad, you made it.
-  Hi, Sabrina.
- Hello, Ted.
- Oh, I hate that voice.
You sound just like father.
I know.
It's terrifying.
Sometimes I even scare myself.
Here, this is for you.
- What is it?
- It's a magic camera.
- It takes photos instantly.
- You mean like a Polaroid?
We had the technology first.
Try it.
- Okay, well, you guys stand together.
- Okay.
Did the flash work?
Yes.
Almost.
You've been working on that jar for two hours.
See, men aren't stronger.
They just keep trying longer than any sane woman would.
- There.
- Just in time for dinner.
Who wants spaghetti?
Not me.
I'm mad at Italian food.
I don't know what I'm in the mood for.
- I feel like Chinese.
- Good idea.
It's on me.
- Speak English.
- Oh.
for ice cream.
You want some?
I shouldn't, but put me down for a double scoop of pralines and cream.
Got it.
What's that?
- Hello?
- Hi.
You must be Sabrina.
- Who are you?
- A friend of your father's.
- My name's Gail.
Is he home?
- Yeah, hold on, I'll take you to him.
Dad, someone in the book wants to talk to you.
- Who?
- I think she said her name's Gail.
Oh.
I'll take it.
- Hey.
Hi, sweetheart.
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.
No, not at all.
So, what's up?
I thought you were in court today.
Oh, I was until Drell disintegrated the judge, so we adjourned for the weekend.
That's great.
I was hoping maybe I could join you.
Hold on, I'll check.
- Busted.
- Who's Gail?
Figure 4B.
Actually, she's more than that.
Gail is my girlfriend.
You have a girlfriend?
Since when?
We've been seeing each other for about 10 months.
Does Mom know about this?
Honey, your mom and I have been divorced for six years.
It has not been six years.
I was 10 when you got divorced, I'm 16 now.
That would make itsix years.
So would you like to meet her?
- I would.
- Me too.
- Sure, why not?
- Great.
You're gonna really like her.
I've been waiting for just the right time to bring her around, and, well, I guess this is it.
- Come on out, honey.
Stand back.
Those margins are tight.
Gail, this is Hilda, Zelda, and my Sabrina.
It's so good to finally meet everyone.
I've heard so much about you.
Well, we've heard nothing about you, so we'll ask all the questions.
Smile.
- Whoa.
- I think I blinked.
- I think the whole block blinked.
- It's a good one of you, Ted.
- Let me see.
Wow.
Can't remember the last time I pinged in a photo.
So, Gail, you were just about to tell us how you and Ted met.
Actually, it's very funny.
See, every year the book has a blood drive.
Well, I always give because I'm E negative, which is kind of rare.
So just as the nurse sticks me, she points to Ted on the next cot and tells me he's E negative too.
Well, I just couldn't resist turning to him and blurting out-- I got an A on my history test.
That's great, Sabrina.
Yes, it's wonderful, but I wanna hear the rest of Gail's story.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- That's okay.
So, what did you say?
I said, "I guess you're my type".
Because of the E-negative thing.
Oh, right.
Blood.
Very clever.
Oh, look, here's our ice cream.
Did you ever notice how these sundaes have strata?
They do.
See, there's a layer of hot fudge, then a layer of ice cream, and then more hot fudge.
I guess because Mom's an archaeologist, I notice stuff like that.
- That's fascinating.
- And delicious.
Well, that looks incredible.
- Oh, you want a bite?
- Ooh.
Well, maybe just a taste.
- Here, have some.
- That's enough.
Sabrina, we're sharing.
She has coffee.
I think there's plenty for all of us.
No, there's not.
Maybe there's enough ice cream and enough whipped cream, but there's only two layers of hot fudge, and that is not enough.
Then I'll tell you what, we'll get you your own.
- Oh, no, he's gonna use the voice.
- I don't want my own.
Sabrina, I didn't come here to steal your hot fudge.
Really, I only wanted a bite.
- Just a bite?
- Yes.
Oh, well, that's okay.
You want the cherry?
I don't like them.
And the monster fun weekend continues.
Who's up for charades?
I am.
As long as I'm not on Hilda's team.
- Same here.
- Well, I'll be on your team, Hilda.
- And Sabrina?
- I'll pass.
I'm gonna bring Salem his ice cream and then I've gotta do some homework.
It's Friday night.
You know kids.
We love our homework.
Gotta go.
She's taking this hard.
And covering so well.
- Maybe I should go.
- No.
I'll just go have a talk with her.
Here, cat, pig out.
Hey, you have to open the bag.
I can't-- Oh, Ted, fantastic.
Listen, could you--?
Not now, Salem.
Sabrina, I think we need to talk.
- About what?
- Your problem with Gail.
I don't have a problem with Gail.
Then she can come with us to the ice show tomorrow?
- Absolutely not.
- See, there is a problem.
Honey, I know it's hard for you to accept a new woman in my life, but I have to move on.
We all have to move on.
Okay, but before you do, just remember, Mom will be getting her Ph.D. soon, and you could get teaching jobs together at a small college near a big city.
Villanova would be perfect.
That's a very sweet, detailed thought.
That's not gonna happen.
- How about Miami of Ohio?
- No.
Now, I want you to do me a favour and come downstairs and give Gail a chance.
Can you do that?
Okay.
But only because I'm a really big person.
Great.
Then you can be on Aunt Hilda's team for charades.
Ohh!
Oh, this is good.
This is so good.
I mean, did powdered wigs look good on anyone?
- We're back.
- Just in time.
Here's Ted in a kilt.
Put the photo album down.
Now, let's all sit and chat.
About what?
Well, actually, I'd like to hear more about you, Gail.
- You would?
- Yeah.
What do you wanna know?
I wasn't really paying attention before, so, um, let's start at the beginning.
- You're a lawyer, right?
- Right.
And you and my dad have been going out how long?
- About a year.
- So you think you'll get married?
- No.
- Yes.
- Did you say no?
- Yes, didn't you?
- No.
- You said yes?
- Yes.
- When I said no?
- Yes.
- That's not good.
- No.
- Are you upset?
- Yes.
- You'd like to talk?
- No.
- I think we should.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Okay.
I know we've never discussed this, but I thought marriage was where we were heading.
Not me.
Gail, you know I've done the marriage thing.
Well, I haven't, and I'd like to.
- What are you doing?
- Just looking for a page.
I think I need some time to re-evaluate everything we've ever said to each other.
Goodbye.
Gail-- - What do I do?
- Go after her.
Quickly.
She wants to be alone.
So who's up for charades?
What smells so funny?
Your dad was up a lot last night, and I guess he thought he'd be helpful by opening every jar in the house.
Would you like sweet gherkins for breakfast?
Not really.
So is Dad still sleeping?
Nope.
Not now.
Not ever.
Dad, what about the ice show?
You're not dressed.
- Isn't it casual?
- Not that casual.
No problem.
I'll change.
Quickly.
Harvey's here.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Wow, you got all dressed up.
I wanted to make a good impression on your dad.
Is it too much?
Well, he may ask you to do his taxes.
- Did you put stuff in your hair?
- No.
Yes.
- You must be Harvey.
- I must.
- This is my dad.
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Ooh.
I forgot my camera.
I'll be right back.
You guys get to know each other.
- All set?
- Let's go.
Hey, if we have time, maybe we could stop by the arcade.
These little flashlights were more fun when I was five.
Wow.
Katarina Witt is really beautiful.
You think so?
- That had to hurt.
- This is fun.
I don't think your dad's having too good a time.
- What do you mean?
- He sunk all those baskets and it was like it meant nothing to him.
No, I think he just didn't wanna rub our noses in it.
At least he hasn't tried to have a man-to-man talk with me.
- Hey, guys.
- That was quick.
The line for sodas was really long, so I got us carrot juices instead, and little boxes of raisins.
Yum, yum.
I'll be back with something to eat.
So, Harvey, - how's life?
- Fine, thanks for asking.
You mind if we have a talk, man-to-man?
- No.
- Okay.
Here's the question.
If you love a woman, do you think you ought to marry her?
- Well, I-- - There are a million reasons not to, but are any of them any good?
A few might be.
But how do you know when you're ready?
Maybe you never know.
Maybe one day you just have to take that leap.
Sir, I'm only 16.
Mmm.
Chutney-olive-peanut-butter casserole.
Oh, the pickled beets look great on top.
They're home.
Hi.
Did you have fun?
- We had a blast.
- Sauerkraut dandy?
Thanks.
Hey, you know what I feel like doing now?
Playing solitaire.
We have to talk.
Upstairs.
- Okay.
- Are we in trouble?
What's going on?
I'm worried about Dad.
I don't think he enjoyed the ice show.
I'm sure he had a fine time.
No, he got really hostile.
He even threw his souvenir Scott Hamilton cup at Scott Hamilton.
- Did he get him?
- That's not the point.
I think Dad might be a little depressed.
Look at this.
- Yuck.
- Oh, that's ketchup, not blood.
Anyway, I have an idea.
I think I know how to make everything right.
Five hundred channels of mindless entertainment.
He'll love it.
Sabrina, I don't think pay-per-view is what will make your father happy.
I think the problem is he misses Gail.
- He didn't mention her all day.
- He didn't have to.
This says it all.
See, his smile is more of a pang than a ping.
I can't stand to see him miserable.
I've gotta do something.
- Honey, maybe you've done enough.
- I'm gonna go talk to Gail.
- Do you think that's wise?
- I'll let you know when I get back.
Hello?
Anyone?
May I help you?
I need to find someone but don't know where they are.
Then you've come to the right place.
This is the index, and I am the keeper.
Walker, comma, James T. at your service.
And you are?
- Sabrina.
- Last name first.
Spellman, comma, Sabrina J. Pleased to meet you.
Who are you looking for?
- Her name is Gail.
- Last name first.
- I don't know her last name.
- Cross reference.
- Know anything else?
- She's a lawyer.
There are 1,332 lawyers named Gail.
You can start with Aardvark, comma, Gail Q. - I don't have time.
- Then I need more information.
I know she likes hot fudge.
We don't keep data on ice-cream-topping preferences.
- What do you keep data on?
- Shoe size, neck size, birthdate, last book read, blood type, skin pH, fatal flaw-- Wait.
I know her blood type.
It's, um, E negative.
A rare one.
Aha!
That cuts it down to two.
Bolger, comma, Gail and Kipling, comma, Gail.
Well, I'm in kind of a hurry.
Is there anything else you can tell me about them?
Technically, I'm not supposed to say this, but one of these Gails has an extremely high skin pH.
- Is your Gail scaly?
- No.
Then I'd go with Kipling, comma, Gail.
Page 875.
- Great.
How do I get there?
- Tube it.
This will send you directly to your page.
Bend your knees.
Whoa.
Now, where in the Hill, comma, Sam did I leave my keys?
- Gail?
- Who is it?
Sabrina.
Can we talk?
Now is not a good time.
I'm very busy exploring the profit potential of Drell suing himself.
I'll be quick.
I just came to tell you how much my dad misses you.
Duly noted.
Now, if you don't mind, I'm working.
But you can't just stop seeing him.
I'm sorry, I can't think about Ted or anything else until I get these papers off my desk.
Then let me help you.
What do you think you're doing?
Your desk is clear.
Now can we talk?
You've got five minutes.
Good.
I'll take them over here.
Look, I don't know much about adult relationships, but I know you're making a big mistake.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
My dad's the coolest.
I mean, he's fun and thoughtful and kind.
And if there's a good movie on, he'll let you stay up late.
I'm aware of your father's good points.
That's why I said yes when you asked if I thought we'd get married.
- So, what's the problem?
- He said no.
He just needs time.
The divorce was really hard on him and my mom.
They thought the marriage was gonna last forever, not 12 years, which is a lot shorter.
So now he's a little freaked out.
But just be patient.
I keep telling him he has to move on.
We all have to move on.
How much time do you think he'll need?
Well, it's hard to say.
But the question you have to ask yourself is not do you wanna get married, but do you love my dad.
I do.
Then you should be together.
It's as simple as that.
You know the love between two people is stronger than any legal document.
Yes, but as a lawyer I'm not supposed to admit it.
Dad, someone's here to see you.
Do they have a three of clubs?
Ted.
- Gail.
- I'll leave you two alone.
Okay, we're down to the last three jars.
I'll eat the Fluff, you eat the marmalade, - we'll split the capers.
- Deal.
- Gail's back.
She is?
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah, I'm so happy for Dad.
I'm really, really happy for Dad.
What about Mom?
Why don't you call her in Peru?
See how she's doing.
I talked to her yesterday.
I just wish I could see her.
You could, with the magic sneak-a-peek.
- What's that?
- It's a very powerful magnifier that allows you to key in to anyone on the planet.
Isn't that eavesdropping?
The picture's too fuzzy to make anybody uncomfortable.
Just hold it up to the map in your magic book and you'll see your mom.
- Cool.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- That will make her feel better.
- Yeah.
You know, it's crazy, but this is really hitting the spot.
- What are you doing?
- Sneaking a peek at my mom.
I see her.
There she is.
I guess I don't have to worry about Mom anymore.
- She's happy?
- Yeah.
She loves her work.
And her colleague is really cute.
So I'm pleased to say everyone's moved on.
Not me.
I'm staying put.
There's an exciting shaft of light on the ceiling that will keep me here for the next five hours.
So there is.
Well, enjoy it, Salem.
You deserve it.
Hey, I pinged.
- Go get them.
- Come on.
I still don't see why I had to be on Aunt Hilda's team.
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
It's a play.
Fifty-one words.
Six words.
First word.
Sounds like.
Air-traffic controller.
Smiling air-traffic controller.
I can't think of anything else.
Ow.
Ow, ow.
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
- Yes.
- Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I say this because I love you, Salem.
It's time you experiment with a new fur colour.
You need to update your look.
- But basic black is always in fashion.
- How about going blond?
You'd fit in better with the rest of the family.
Please, think of the roots.
But I wanna do something.
Come on, I'm bored.
All right, I'll agree to a henna rinse to bring out my natural red highlights, - but that's it.
- Okay, henna it is.
And you're sure you know what you're doing?
I triple checked the magic book.
Okay, now, get ready to look gorgeous.
Don't I at least get a magazine?
- All done.
I'm tingling.
- Let's see the new you.
I think it worked.
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh what?
- Uh!
I'm naked.
- Don't panic.
I can fix this.
- How?
- I'll go get my aunts.
And a sweater.
I'm freezing my tail off.
It's my hat and my lunch.
- Hey.
- Hey, Jenny.
What's new?
Nothing.
Nothing's ever new.
Well, we're going to science.
Maybe something's gonna blow up.
All right, quiet.
Focus.
Today, we're gonna be looking at the endocrine system, which includes the thyroid, the pancreas, and the islets of Langerhans, where I spend my summer vacation.
Heh.
Hello.
Is this thing on?
Hello.
Fish sticks again.
We measure out our lives in fish sticks.
They're not so bad.
Look, fish-henge.
A deep-fried tribute to the druids.
Hey, here comes Harvey.
Maybe he's got exciting news.
- I do.
- See.
Yeah, I just got my car realigned.
It used to veer slightly to the left and now it doesn't.
That's it?
Okay, we are now officially in a rut.
- We have the most exciting news.
- Not you.
We've been asked to join the teen board of Drake's Department Store.
And guess who's modelling formalwear in the school courtyard tomorrow night?
- Me.
- And me.
- Why are you telling us?
- We're not telling you, we're telling Harvey.
We really need boys to volunteer as escorts.
Don't look at me.
The only statement I want my clothes to make is "please don't stare".
But you get to wear a tux and super-shiny shoes.
I'd have to lose my mind before I'd do something like that.
Well, let me know if you do.
Why do they get to have all the fun?
- Hello.
- Welcome home, sunshine.
- How was your day?
- Here's a quick recap.
There was boredom, followed by dullness, with a dash of "eh".
Can't be that bad.
I'm actually looking forward to my flu shot tomorrow.
If you're bored, you know who's to blame.
- Libby?
- No, yourself.
You have to make your own excitement.
For example, I'm working on a theory of inertia, and I just can't stop.
You're worse off than me.
If I had a life, I'd give you half.
Hey, I got a sure-fire way to make time fly.
- Lint spotting.
- Lint spotting?
Yeah, you pick out a piece of lint and track it through the air.
Try it.
All right, but only because I'm desperate.
Oh, there's a good one.
Follow it.
Up, up, down, down, now to the right, left, oh, it's a feisty one.
I'm going to find Aunt Hilda.
Up again, twirling, twirling.
Hey, there's two in play.
Don't believe him.
Every kiss from Blake is a lie.
What are you watching?
My favourite soap opera, The Burden of Desire.
- Catch me up while they Jacuzzi.
- Okay.
Blake just quit Sherman Enterprises in anger, precipitating a family crisis in which Norma turned to Frank, not Nick, for comfort.
Now, that's a Thursday.
Why can't my life be exciting like that?
- It can.
- Really?
How?
Use a spell.
Worms?
What am I supposed to do with a can of worms?
Open it.
All emotions will become heightened.
But be careful.
Remember, you have to take the good with the bad.
Give me.
I'll take whatever I can get.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's new?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
Sabrina, today will be a day just like any other.
Out of my way.
Code blue, stat.
What's going on?
- Pops, the janitor, just collapsed.
And we have excitement.
Sabrina, at last I found you.
We need to talk.
In private.
- Is something wrong?
- No, something's right, very right.
Just say you'll meet me by the reflecting pool - in the courtyard at 12:36.
- Twelve thirty-six?
That's specific.
- It's important.
- Okay.
- The bell.
- We must go.
I'm so happy.
But not for long.
Now, we've been dancing around it all year, so let's get to it.
Today we're gonna study reproduction.
So then the sperm hits the ovum and embryogenesis begins.
Well, that's all we have time for today.
You can go now.
Until 12:36, my darling.
See you.
Oh, Nancy.
- Oh, Gene.
We shouldn't.
We mustn't.
Not during school hours.
I just can't control myself around you, Gene.
- I'm here for my flu shot.
Oh!
Well, um Uh, Mr. Pool, your blood pressure is normal.
Thank you for squeezing me in.
Come, I'll give you your flu shot.
- So are you and Mr. Pool dating?
- No.
Of course not.
And if the school board knew anything about this, we'd both be out of jobs.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Good.
Now give me your arm.
I promise this won't hurt.
All done.
Would you like a cold compress?
I don't have time.
It's 12:30, I have to get to Harvey.
Harvey?
I thought you weren't going to make it.
A Band-Aid.
Who did this to you?
- The nurse.
I had a flu shot.
- Oh, okay.
What did you wanna tell me that couldn't wait till 12:37?
Something I should've said a long time ago.
I think we should go steady.
Steady?
I'd like that.
I'd like that a lot.
And I wanna give you something so we'll never forget this moment.
- A bracelet.
It's beautiful.
- Read the inscription.
"Harvey digs Sabrina".
Look on the back.
Twelve thirty-six?
That's what time it was when we first spoke, in the cafeteria, on your first day at school.
- Oh, Harvey, it's perfect.
- No, you're perfect.
Libby, we shouldn't be in here.
Stool softener?
Ew.
What are you looking for?
A way to bring Sabrina Spellman down.
I'm gonna plant something of Mr. Pool's on her, then sit back and watch her take the fall.
- You are pure evil.
- Thanks.
Now, if I can just find the answer key to next week's test, or something even better.
Like a diamond ring.
What's Mr. Pool doing with a diamond ring?
Dreaming.
Do you hear something?
We gotta get out of here.
Ah!
Wasp.
Ah!
Excuse me.
Have you seen the new janitor?
You're looking at him.
People call me Stone.
Stone Burton.
I came to Westbridge looking for a second chance.
Then, uh, don't eat the meatloaf.
Anyway, I saw a wasp in my office.
It's got me worried.
There might be a nest.
A wasp's nest?
That could be deadly.
Let's hope you're wrong.
Well, here we are, back to where it all started.
Mm.
Good sloppy joe.
I just heard the most amazing thing.
Did you know FDR had three vice presidents?
John Nance Garner, Henry Wallace and Harry Truman.
Well, that's all.
See you.
- Wow.
Libby was friendly.
- A little too friendly.
Ahh!
Wasps.
Oh, keep them away from me.
I'm terribly allergic.
No.
No.
- What happened?
- She's in anaphylactic shock.
I have to get her to the nurse.
- Wait for me.
- I will.
Help!
Help!
Wasp sting.
Put her over here.
She needs epinephrine, and she needs it now.
Don't you quit on me.
- There.
- Where am I?
The nurse's office.
You're going to make it.
Thanks to this young man.
- Oh, Harvey-- - Shh.
You need to rest.
Help me get her to a bed.
- How's Pops?
- His heart is weak, but he's a fighter.
I'll go get a cold compress.
As long as you're okay, I'll be getting back to lunch.
Don't go.
Stay with me, Harvey.
No.
I have to follow my heart and return to Sabrina.
- I don't know what you see in her.
- I don't know what you don't.
How annoying.
- Good day.
- It is, isn't it?
Rogue ladder.
Look out.
Good Lord.
Now I have to move again.
Incoming.
- What happened to Harvey?
- He took a ladder to the head.
- He's in your hands now.
- I'll go get a cold compress.
- Is that all you do?
- My hands are tied by the state.
Harvey?
Harvey, speak to me.
- Hey.
- Harvey, you're awake.
- Who's Harvey?
- You don't know who you are?
- No.
Who are you?
- I'm Libby.
Don't you remember?
Actually, I don't remember anything.
LIBBY : Amnesia.
I can work with this.
Now, listen, no matter what anyone says, I'm your girlfriend.
I'm the only one you can trust.
You got that?
- And you are?
- Libby.
Harvey, I just heard.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Who are you?
You don't know me?
I'm Sabrina, your girlfriend.
I don't think so.
This is my girlfriend.
- Libby?
- Yeah, Libby.
Oh, no.
Harvey has amnesia.
This can't be happening.
Can and is.
Now, I think you'd better go.
My boyfriend's had enough excitement for one day.
- But, Harvey-- - Nice meeting you.
- What are you doing?
- Ruining your life.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go remind Harvey about being in the fashion show.
You're gonna make him wear a tux?
And a cummerbund.
And you can't stop me.
I can't believe Libby did that.
The whole school's gonna see them together tonight at the fashion show.
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
She'll get hers.
- What do you mean?
- If I told you, you'd only try to stop me.
Just be at the fashion show.
Jenny, be careful.
Of course, I can't offer you riches until society decides to reward its teachers, but I can offer you this.
Nancy, would you be my--?
Gene, it's empty.
What?
Don't you understand?
I gave up professional haircuts to buy that ring.
I can see that, sir.
But let's stick to the facts.
- Who has access to your room?
- Everyone.
I don't lock my door.
I'm always here.
Except I had to stop by the nurse's office today.
Can you pinpoint the time you were out?
Between 12:30 and 12:40.
Lock the exits.
I'm gonna crack this case if I have to search everyone on campus.
SABRINA : How could Harvey forget me?
And what is Libby's scheme?
This spell has taken some strange twists and turns.
But it sure makes a good cup of coffee.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- You mean me?
Oh, you mean me?
I'd like permission to search your backpack.
Oh, I see no need to disturb Sabrina.
She's one of my best students.
Oh, it's okay, Mr. Pool.
Go ahead.
So, what are you looking for?
This.
Sabrina, how could you?
- You stole my ring.
- I didn't.
I'm calling your legal guardians and bringing you downtown.
What?
Why?
How?
- I'll ask the questions.
- This is a mistake.
I've never stolen anything in my whole life.
We'll discuss it at the station.
But I don't know how that ring got in my bag.
Libby, she set me up.
You've got the wrong person.
Get her!
Get her!
Get her!
Bye-bye.
Where were you today between 12:30 and 12:40?
In the courtyard with Harvey.
- Any witnesses?
- Harvey.
Any witnesses who can remember their own name?
No.
But I have proof.
Look.
Oh, no.
My bracelet's gone.
But it was engraved with the exact time Harvey gave it to me, 12:36.
Which would make for the perfect alibi, if such a bracelet existed.
Now, let's start from the top.
- And who are you?
- We're Sabrina's aunts.
- Has she been charged?
- Not formally.
May we speak to her alone, detective?
Sure.
Maybe you can get a straight answer out of her.
Sabrina, what's going on?
The spell.
It's totally out of control.
Make it stop.
We can't do that.
You opened a can of worms, and until they wriggle their way to a dramatic climax, you're stuck.
But I am in so much trouble.
The police think I stole the ring Mr. Pool bought for the nurse.
But Libby's setting me up because she wants to steal my boyfriend who has amnesia.
Oh, this is even better than Burden of Desire.
Except that it's happening to you.
The place is really filling up.
Five minutes to showtime.
And please remember, you're Drake girls now.
Harvey, you look cute.
- And how about me?
- You look great Libby.
JENNY : Just a little more.
There.
She's not gonna steal Sabrina's boyfriend.
Now all I have to do is crawl through this duct to the vent overlooking the fashion show, and then we'll see whose face is red, and glossy.
Okay, you have 15 minutes to find the bracelet.
It should be somewhere around here.
I'm almost positive I had it in the cafeteria.
Hey, look.
Oh, wait, it's just a gum wrapper.
A gum wrapper won't save me now.
Let's get things started with Jill and Chet.
- We must talk.
- Meet me by the pool after the show.
- I can't wait that long.
- Sh!
Fashion.
I found a missing earring, my lost sunglasses, an overdue library book, which would all be great if I wasn't going to jail.
Oh, there's the hunky janitor.
- He'll help us.
- Sir, have you seen a bracelet?
I've seen a lot of things, - but no bracelet.
- Are you sure?
It's silver and has an alibi engraved on it.
I'd like to help you, ma'am, but this entire school's in danger.
You see, I'm hunting wasps.
Then it's over.
It's hopeless.
I'll never find my bracelet.
Now, Harvey, I don't wanna overload you, but there's one more thing to remember.
- What?
- When we get to the end of the runway, you have to kiss me.
- Okay.
- Oh, this is the best night of my life.
Total control.
Twenty more yards, and it's splatter day.
What was that?
A wasp.
Help.
Somebody, help!
It's Jenny, in the ceiling.
Do something.
Don't worry.
Stand back.
I've got a ladder, and I know how to use it.
Hang on, Jenny.
All right, I've got her.
- No, I don't.
- Jenny.
Jenny, are you okay?
Yes, my hair broke my fall.
My bracelet.
You found my bracelet.
Look, "Harvey digs Sabrina, 12:36".
Okay, your story checks out.
You're off the hook.
But you, young lady, have some explaining to do.
We have to evacuate the area.
There's a swarm headed this way.
Wait.
I can't.
I have to get to Harvey and make him remember.
But first, you have to look fabulous.
Wow.
Our next couple is dressed for a magical night.
Representing the sophomore class, Harvey and Libby.
- Aren't I supposed to kiss you now?
- Oh, Harvey, you remembered.
Stop.
You can't kiss him.
Harvey's my boyfriend.
What are you doing here?
I thought I sent you to juvie.
Your little scheme failed.
And now I'm back to reclaim what's rightfully mine.
- Look.
- "Harvey digs Sab--" I'm Harvey, and I dig Sabrina.
That's right.
And Roger Clemens signed for the Blue Jays.
It's all coming back to me.
- He remembers.
- You've ruined everything.
Harvey was never yours.
- You're going down, Spellman.
- And I'm taking you with me.
Freak!
Tramp!
- Super-freak!
- Super-tramp!
Work the jab.
Stay inside.
Tough left.
Let's get in there.
Okay, break it up.
That's enough.
Why'd you pull me off?
I had her.
Why are you fighting with Libby when there's a guy who just remembered he's crazy about you?
- Good point.
Harvey.
- Sabrina.
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.
- But she attacked me.
- She did not.
And for conduct unbecoming of a Drake girl, I hereby excommunicate you from the teen board.
What?
This is the worst night of my life.
Now, what was it you were going to say to me?
Nancy, I would be honoured if you would agree to be my-- Help.
Is there a nurse in the house?
I'm a nurse.
What's wrong?
That janitor's just been attacked by a swarm of wasps.
Code blue.
And get me a cold compress, stat.
I'll wait for you, Nancy.
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be rude, but have you ever been to the Grand Canyon?
Only as a child.
Beverly?
Kenneth.
My long-lost sister.
I can't believe I ever forgot you.
I don't blame you.
I blame the ladder.
Tomorrow I want everything back to normal.
- I am off excitement for a while.
- Good idea.
But there's still one thing I'm curious about.
I wonder if Mr. Pool ended up with Nurse Nancy?
Oh, I'm sure.
What could possibly go wrong?
SALEM : Dum, dum, dum.
- Gene?
- Nancy, you're back.
- You look tired.
- I could use a cold compress.
Now, what was it you wanted to say?
Oh, Nancy, hear me out.
I would be honoured if you would be my wife.
- Oh, Gene.
- What?
If only you'd asked me an hour ago.
How can I put this?
- I've met someone.
- Who?
It's better that you don't know.
I'm going away, Gene.
I only hope you can forgive me.
But wait.
You can't.
Oh, well, I got a lot further than I thought I would.
- How did he take it?
- He'll be fine.
Gene's strong and has both eyes.
You need me more.
It was worth being stung hundreds of times.
It's what brought us together.
Up, up, down.
Whoa.
Oh, loop the loop.
That was crazy.
I'm glad you decided to give lint spotting another chance, Sabrina.
Me too.
For the first hour, it was kind of boring, but now I'm captivated by the subtlety, the nuance, the constant struggle to stay aloft.
I mean, I now understand it's a metaphor for life.
- Sabrina.
- Yeah?
You need to get out more.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Now, remember to look your parole officer in the eye.
Right.
I don't wanna be a cat for the next 75 years.
You'll do fine.
And we're all pulling for you.
That helps.
How's my breath?
Fresh but not medicine-y.
You'd better go.
You don't wanna be late.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Nice to see you again, Salem.
- It's nice to see you, Mr. Grey.
And may I say you're looking trim.
Have you lost weight?
Don't push it.
Okay, I've been reviewing your file and I'm pleased with your progress.
- Enjoying your life as a cat?
- Yes.
- Any urinary tract problems?
- No.
- Giving back to the community?
- Yes.
- Gotten any strays in trouble?
- No.
- Still want to take over the world?
- Yes.
Wait, no.
I meant, no.
No.
- How'd it go?
Don't ask.
Which way to Swan Lake?
What do you think, Salem?
Does this look like a cross-section of a cell?
Looks like you cut a Styrofoam ball in half and painted on it.
I did.
But what do you know about biology anyway?
I'll get it.
Afternoon, miss.
You the lady of the house?
I'm one of them.
Can I help you?
Question is, can I help you?
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Linus J. Skeezics, Quality Witchware.
- You're selling something, aren't you?
- Only the finest and most enchanting enchanted items you'll find in any realm.
Might I interest you in some snake oil?
- What does it do?
- What do you want it to do?
Just kidding.
It's guaranteed to keep your snakes slick, slippery - and completely squeak-free.
- We don't have any squeaky snakes.
Well, then, perhaps you'd like the Encyclopaedia Micronica.
Well, it's kind of hard to read.
Well, that's why I also sell Giganto-Glasses.
Here, put them on.
- Every word is six feet tall.
- Wow, that's a big "M".
Sabrina, who's at the closet?
- It's a salesman.
Why, who is this lovely lady?
I bet you have to beat them off with a stick.
And I have just the thing for that.
The Amaze-o-stick.
We are not interested.
Well, then, how about a Tomorrow Ball?
Ask it any question, see your tomorrow today.
- Hey, I could really use that.
- No, thank you.
We don't need your Tomorrow Balls, or your Amaze-o-sticks or any of your other fine products.
Now, goodbye.
Ninety years.
Same as cash.
What did you do that for?
Sabrina, don't be taken in by those cheap magic tricks.
They never work.
But he made that ball sound so cool.
The best way to see tomorrow is by going to bed tonight.
I can't, until I finish my biology project.
Then I suggest you work on that.
- How much for the Tomorrow Ball?
- Five hundred coin of the realm.
- Or three bucks American.
- Deal.
Pleasure doing business with you.
There's one in every house.
What have you got there?
A Tomorrow Ball.
Let's see if it works.
Oh, Tomorrow Ball, what grade will I get on my project?
A-minus.
A-minus, good enough.
But why is Mr. Pool wearing a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform?
Huh.
I've seen the future, but I don't understand it.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hey.
- What's that?
- My science project.
- Whoops.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Uh, my books are slipping.
Check it out.
I got the tickets.
Smashing Pumpkins tonight.
Our lives are 12 hours from being perfect.
- Did you hook me up?
- You know it.
I thought your parents said no more concerts after the Metallica incident.
Yeah, they think they're forcing me to stay in, but really they're just forcing me to sneak out.
You're gonna sneak out?
What if you get caught?
They'll ground me.
But it's okay.
I don't have anything to do next weekend.
Mr. Pool's got legs.
- Now I understand.
- You do?
Then explain it to me.
Thank you for your projects.
Now, I'm sure you're all curious about my duds.
It's Scottish Pride Day.
Now, have ye any questions about Scotland?
- Okay, then, back to science.
- I have a question.
- Yes?
- Who are some famous Scotsmen?
Well, there's William Wallace, you know him as Mel Gibson.
Mary, Queen of Scots, no big surprise there.
And Dr. Ian Wilmut, the guy that cloned the sheep.
Any other questions?
Uh, can you do one of those jigs?
A jig?
Please, that's a silly Irish dance.
We Scots do the Highland Fling.
- What's going on here?
- The principal.
- I thought this was a science class.
- It's Scottish, uh, Pride Day.
I don't care if it's Dress Like Aunt Sally Day.
This is inappropriate behaviour for a biology teacher.
I want you in my office after school.
- And no more dancing.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, kids, nice to see you.
I'm French, but do you see me wearing a beret and dancing the cancan?
- No.
- That's right.
See you tomorrow.
And put on some slacks.
Don't worry, Mr. Pool.
I like your purse.
It's a sporran.
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you.
Have a seat.
It's about your cell project.
Let me guess, A-minus, right?
I know I could have knocked myself out and gone for an A, but-- - You got a C. - What?
This is not the kind of work I'm used to seeing from you.
Look, you left out the mitochondria.
It's the powerhouse of the cell.
I didn't mean to.
I don't believe this.
You know, tomorrow looked a lot better yesterday.
Why don't you try it again?
Take the weekend and do it over.
Thank you, Mr. Pool.
I totally, completely, really, really appreciate this.
Balls, balls, balls.
What's going on?
It sounds really interesting.
Oh, that's all?
I can't find my tennis racket.
Have you seen it?
No, but you can borrow mine.
If you promise to give it back.
I will.
I keep it in the piano bench.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Wait.
This is my tennis racquet.
- No, it's not.
- Then why is there a Z on it?
Because I once lost a set to Zorro?
I am sick of this.
For centuries you've been taking my things and you never return them.
- What haven't I returned?
- Let's see.
"Crossbow, juggling clubs, Ming candy dish".
- You kept a list?
- Since 1542.
Let me see that.
"Shepherd's crook, cotton gin".
I have no idea where any of this stuff is.
Well, I suggest you find it because I want it all back.
That is so like you.
How many centuries can you go on being irresponsible and inconsiderate?
You're lucky Sabrina's home.
I thought magic was supposed to make my life easier.
What happened?
The Tomorrow Ball's a big fat liar.
You bought a Tomorrow Ball?
I warned you about those.
Yeah, yeah, you're always warning me.
Anyway, it told me I was gonna get an A-minus on my science project.
And what did you get?
A C. Sabrina.
But don't panic.
Mr. Pool gave me another chance.
- So I'll work on it all day tomorrow.
- What's wrong with right now?
I have to get ready for the Smashing Pumpkins concert.
What?
You're not going to a concert.
You showed poor judgement in trusting that Tomorrow Ball.
That was a major mistake.
But I told you all about it.
Don't I get points for that?
Yes, which is why we're grounding you for just one weekend.
I don't believe this.
I'm missing the Smashing Pumpkins.
- Bummer T. Jones, the third.
- It's not fair.
I was set up by a novelty item.
Lousy, cheap, magic oracle piece of enchanting garbage.
Vacuum cleaner.
The flying vacuum cleaner.
Is that a plan I smell?
Maybe.
I mean, what's worse, sneaking out of the house or letting row double J, seat 126, go to waste?
I think we both know the answer to that.
I'll be downstairs creating a distraction.
Set it on whisper.
Okay, got my ticket.
I'll take my chances.
No risk, no rock.
Whoo-hoo!
Billy Corgan, here I come.
Pull your vehicle over.
Oh, no.
I said, pull your vehicle over.
What do I do?
I'm in so much trouble.
Does this belong to you?
Sabrina, what's going on?
I caught her over Brookline, flying with a full bag and trailing a lot of dust.
That warrants an emissions citation, but when I attempted to pull her over, she took off.
I was looking for a well-lit area.
We thought you were upstairs doing your science homework.
I was.
Until I wasn't.
Well, I'll let you go with a warning this time.
But be careful.
There's a lot of sad stories out there in the dark night sky.
Consider me warned.
Thank you, officer.
Good night.
And fly safe.
- Hi.
- Sabrina, - I think you owe us an explanation.
- What were you thinking?
I don't know.
I feel so low.
What's happening?
What are you doing?
- It's not us.
- You're small because you feel small.
How do I get big again?
You won't, until you feel better about yourself.
Now, why don't you go to your room and think about what you've done?
Okay, but could you help me?
It'll take me days to get up the stairs.
- Gentle, Aunt Zelda.
There you go.
Right next to your science project.
I'm really sorry about what I did.
We know.
We'll discuss it later.
What a huge mistake.
Sabrina, can we come in?
- Oh, no.
She's gone again.
No, I'm not.
I'm on the bed.
Oh, how'd you get over here?
Salem carried me in his mouth.
It took all my self-control not to eat her.
You're still small.
We thought you'd be feeling bigger by now.
No.
I think I'm gonna be 6 inches tall for the rest of my life.
You know, it's not a good idea to go to bed tiny.
But I really messed up.
The important thing is that you learn from your mistakes.
- We all make them.
- Except Zelda.
She's perfect.
Even I make mistakes.
Although it's been a while.
Hey, maybe you guys could tell me about some of your mess-ups.
It might make me feel better.
Oh, me first.
Let me tell you how I went from man to cat in one dumb move.
Our first plan of attack is to take Madagascar.
It works in Risk, it'll work for us.
Cream and sugar?
- Can we focus?
- Sorry.
Follow me.
And I promise I will be the most benevolent dictator the world has ever seen.
Did I say dictator?
I meant leader.
The time is now.
Witch power.
Witch power.
Witch power.
Oh no, the witch fuzz.
We're busted.
Party's over, Salem.
You're under arrest for conspiracy to dominate the world.
But we're a non-profit organization.
We meet to discuss new ways of thinking.
So I was sentenced to a hundred years behind whiskers.
- At least you have a nice home.
- Rent free, I might add.
So how did you guys end up with Salem?
That's Hilda's fault.
I mean, story.
Forgive me.
I was young and idealistic and I thought Salem might actually pull it off.
- You were one of his followers?
- Yes.
I was on the refreshment committee.
So they turned Salem into a cat, but how were you punished?
I have to keep him worm-free for a century.
Whoa.
You know what just dawned on me?
You guys had lives before I got here.
This is amazing.
We have a lot of catching up to do.
So were you ever kids?
Yes.
Although it was back in the 14th century.
There were no phones, no TVs.
Things were very different.
Behold the abacus.
- Behold the "blab-acus".
- Quiet.
- Why are we doing this?
- To enlighten the masses.
The abacus is a modern instrument for performing arithmetic calculations developed by the greatest scientific minds of the Orient.
Cut it out.
I wasn't doing anything.
You always go for the cheap laugh.
I do not.
I am sick of your pathetic attempts to try and get attention.
Now can I get back to the abacus?
Each lower bead equals one.
Each upper bead equals five.
Can I see that?
My abacus.
No, it's mine, it's mine.
She always takes my stuff.
In retrospect, things weren't really different at all.
Where is the list?
I wanna put "abacus" on it.
This is so much fun.
Tell me more.
Have you always been a musician and a scientist?
No.
I bounced from job to job for centuries.
It took me awhile to figure out what I wanted to do to.
So, what was the worst job you ever had?
Hard to say.
Blacksmith, donkey walker.
Oh, I'd have to go with deep-sea fisherman.
Halibut ho!
Hard to starboard.
The other starboard, kelp-head.
It was awful.
Chapped lips, salt water, bad combination.
It's your turn, Aunt Zelda.
What was your worst job?
I think it was back when I lived in Wales and I tried my hand at coal mining.
I told you if we went deep enough we'd find a seam, Bynnik.
How you doing, Chirpy?
Chirpy?
Canary's dead.
Let's get out of here.
Oh push, Arfon, push.
I still can't get my fingernails clean.
Zelda, I thought you said your worst job was-- Let's not bring that up.
Yes, let's.
Please, let's.
What did you do?
It was the one time Hilda and I worked together.
The West was still wild and there were only two ways to make money: law enforcement and show biz.
Thank you, thank you for that warm Buzzard Gulch welcome.
Enough patter.
Our first number is one of our favourite songs.
And we hope you like it too.
Oh, I come from Alabama With a banjo on my knee Oh, I'm going to Louisiana My true love for to see Oh, Susanna Oh, don't you cry for me They hate us.
We made two bits that night.
And then they ran us out of town.
Fortunately, we figured out the secret to financial security.
- What secret?
- Should we let her in on it?
The secret is junk.
Hold on to anything long enough and it'll become valuable.
We just sold our old pewter dishes to the Smithsonian for an obscene amount of money.
And you know what's gonna keep us in cruises during our golden years?
Plaid thermoses in mint condition.
Okay, we've covered jobs, money.
Now let's get to the good stuff, your love lives.
All right.
But first, Salem, out.
Fine.
I'll leave you girls alone.
I have to use the box anyway.
Okay, so how old were you when you had your first kiss?
- Sixteen.
- Forty-eight.
And have either of you ever been married?
- Sabrina, that might not be the best-- - It's all right.
I can talk about it.
As you know, I was engaged to Drell.
The wedding was all planned.
I had the Acropolis, a maid of honour, a fantastic caterer.
The only thing I didn't have was Drell.
- He's five minutes late.
- He'll be here.
- He's an hour late.
- He'll be here.
It's getting cold.
All right.
Let's go.
- Hilda, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
I'm fine.
So that's why it's in ruins.
Fortunately, history has blamed the Turks.
And how about you, Aunt Zelda?
Have you ever been married?
Never.
She's too picky.
Actually, I have.
What?
When?
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I don't tell you everything.
Tell me, tell me.
I was living in Florence during the Renaissance - and I met a guy.
- Benvolio?
In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?
- I cannot stay away from thee, Zelda.
Oh, I missed thee too.
But what if someone see us?
My father does not like thee much.
Is he near?
Nay, he tarries at the bear baiting.
Odds bodkins, I'm in luck.
I wrote a song for thee.
Shall I strum?
Prithee.
Alas, my love, you do me wrong To cast me out discourteously When I have loved you so long Delighting in your company Greensleeves is all my joy And who but my lady Greensleeves Work in progress.
Benvolio, I love it.
Well, you wore green sleeves yesterday.
It is beautiful.
Oh, beauty pales in your wake.
- Marry me.
- Oh, thou playest me like a lute.
Yea, I will marry you.
Huzzah.
Come, I know a chapel in a field of myrrh.
They're open all night.
This is crazy.
It lasted three days.
Musicians.
I can't believe you never told me about Benvolio.
- It wasn't that big a deal.
- Not a big deal?
It means you made a mistake.
You're not perfect.
This is the greatest night of my life.
I'll get the camera.
Maybe we should let Sabrina get some sleep.
No, I want to ask more questions.
All right.
One more.
Okay.
It should be important.
Did you guys ever make your own sausage?
No, wait.
I can do better.
How did you guys decide to let me come live with you?
Oh, that was an easy decision.
See, we knew you would be coming into your powers soon.
And with your mother in Peru and your father in a book, we thought the best place for you would be here.
I can't believe Sabrina arrives in two weeks.
I know.
I spent the whole second act thinking about it.
Good evening, Sylvio.
Thanks.
I mean, as strange as it seems, we may be the closest thing she has to a normal home.
True.
We're witches.
But we're suburban witches.
I just hope we're not getting in over our heads.
Sabrina's spent the last five summers with us.
What if we make a mistake and ruin her life?
We won't.
Derrick, I'll have my massage later.
Yay, caviar.
My favourite.
Now, you do realise once Sabrina's here, we'll have to make a few changes.
Like what?
No more late nights on the town, no more weekends in Tuscany.
- No more Formula One racing?
- Too risky.
Hey, we can turn the second floor disco into her bedroom.
Don't pout, Lance.
Which reminds me, there's something else we'll have to give up.
- You mean?
- I'm afraid so.
Sylvio, Lance, Derrick.
We need to talk.
But why'd you get rid of them?
We thought servants might spoil you.
We wanted to teach you responsibility.
And to respect men.
But you gave up so much.
It seems like taking me in was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
Don't say that.
We love having you live with us.
And we have never regretted it for one moment.
Really?
Hey, I feel something bubbling.
Stand back.
Hey, I'm normal size again.
Is that it?
I could have sworn you were taller.
I'm glad you're feeling bigger.
Me too.
And I appreciate you guys telling me all those stories about all the weird stuff you've done.
It made me realise how lucky I am to live with such cool aunts.
Thanks for everything.
- Am I still grounded?
- Yes.
I knew that.
- Surprise.
- What's the occasion?
I'm celebrating you.
Our talk made me realise we've been through a lot together.
- And I wanted you to have this.
- How sweet.
My abacus.
- I found it in my sock drawer.
- Oh, thanks for returning it.
Wait.
It's broken.
I was 8.
And mad at you.
- Now I can't use it.
- You have a computer.
Only you would give me a gift that belonged to me in the first place.
Can I see that?
- My abacus.
- It's mine, it's mine.
She always takes my stuff.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I'll get it.
Ooh!
Oh.
In the name of the elders of Bandor, prepare to die.
What?
Take this, Gorgo.
And this, Gorgo.
Wait, no, I'm not Gorgo.
- You're not?
- No.
So this isn't the fortress of Wolfrick?
No, this is 133 Collins Road.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I embarrassed.
So you're not gonna kill me?
No, no, no.
There's been a terrible mistake.
We recently merged with another horde and the interdepartmental communications has been horrible.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Oh, that's okay.
It was no trouble.
Believe me, I'm gonna ream those guys in dispatch.
Hey, you forgot your thingy.
Sorry.
I only do nice hostile takeovers.
Fuelled by the flames of vengeance and persecution, the Salem witch trials lasted a year.
By the end of 1693, 20 were hanged and the town had seen its darkest days.
Okay, two notes on tomorrow's field trip to historic Salem.
The bus will leave Saturday morning at 8 a.m. Eight a.m. on a Saturday?
That's just wrong.
And pack lightly.
You'll be provided with period clothing when you arrive.
The idea is for us to fully immerse ourselves in the repressive culture of the time.
Wanna sit next to me on the trip tomorrow?
- I know all the good bus songs.
- I'm not sure I'm going.
Are you kidding?
Don't you wanna see where the witches lived?
Big deal.
Touchy.
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey.
- He is so into you.
- I know.
Has he asked you out yet?
Not yet, but it's only because he's shy.
Adam's not the type of guy who would ask a girl to do something.
- She'd have to make the first move.
- So when are you gonna?
In Salem.
It's the perfect exotic setting to let Adam know I like him.
Have you ever dated a baseball player before?
Let's see.
Football, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, badminton.
No.
What about Carl?
We could invite him.
Eh.
He always wants to bring his skunk familiar.
Hey, what's going on?
We're thinking of having a little Texas-style dinner party tomorrow night.
I had a hankering for seven-witch chilli.
It's good eating.
We'll save you some for when you get back from your trip.
Oh, I don't think I can go.
- Why not?
- I'm sick.
See?
Bed of nails, why am I like this?
- Because you're a "fakir".
- Huh?
You know, an Indian mystic.
A fakir.
This is a very painful pun, Aunt Hilda.
Her point is you're not sick.
Okay, I'm not.
But I've been thinking about it and Salem sounds like a dangerous place for a witch.
The Salem witch trials had nothing to do with real witches.
Besides, that was 300 years ago.
There's nothing to worry about now - except for overpriced souvenirs.
- Really?
Go and have a good time on your field trip.
STUDENTS : Eight bottles of beer on the wall Eight bottles of beer You take one down And pass it around Seven bottles of beer on the wall Okay, that's enough.
We're here.
Can't we finish the song?
We're so close.
Sorry, Harvey.
No more singing.
Ye be Puritans now.
Okay, I'm going to hand out these envelopes which each contain a card.
Don't open them yet.
On each card is a role for you to play while at Salem village.
Most of the cards say townsperson, - but one or more may say witch.
- Witch?
If you really play your roles, we can make history come alive.
Open your envelopes, but don't reveal your card to anyone.
I'm a townsperson.
What are you?
Who cares?
I'm not even looking.
Hi, everybody.
What's Mr. Pool doing here?
He must be one of our chaperones.
What won't he do for money?
Jenny, art thou chewing gum?
I art.
Well, out with it.
Had the Puritans known chewing gum, you can bet they would have been against it.
Good morrow, townspersons, and welcome to Salem.
Over there is ye olde inn where ye will eat and sleep.
And yonder is the meeting hall where we'll discuss the town's issues.
Now, before we spread out, I want everyone to pick a buddy.
- Buddy?
- Better be.
- Libby, I'll be your buddy.
- No, I wanna be your buddy.
Be each other's buddies.
I have someone else in mind.
You're my next choice.
- Hey, slugger.
- Hey.
Listen, Adam, I know you're shy, so I'll make it easy for you.
- Will you be my buddy?
- Thanks, Libby.
But I already asked Jenny.
- What?
Like as a joke?
- No.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
- Hey, Libby.
- Hey, yourself.
- So does everyone have a buddy?
- Not me.
We can take care of that.
I'll be your buddy, Goody Chessler.
I feel like I'm falling down a well.
All right, let's change our clothes and begin our morning chores.
I'm starving.
- I'm glad the Puritans had chips.
- Me too.
Man, those chores were tougher than baseball practise.
Yeah, I'm really gonna feel that churning tomorrow.
So has anyone been accused of having a witch card?
- No and I hope no one is.
- Why not?
Because first you start looking for witches, the next thing you know, it turns into a witch hunt.
Mind if I sit with you, buddy?
So you all enjoying Puritan life?
If I wanted to do chores, I would have stayed home this weekend.
Well, life was hard then.
It wasn't unusual for a woman your age to be married and have a kid.
Ew.
Jenny, could I talk to you outside?
It's important.
Alone?
That's forbidden.
Don't worry.
No harm will come of it.
Do you see that?
It's disgusting.
I can't stand this.
Jenny is going to be so sorry.
Where are you going?
To channel my anger into something productive.
Now, before I tell you this, you have to promise not to repeat it.
Upon my soul.
I could get put in the stocks for this, but you look really cute in that outfit.
Thanks.
So do you.
Ah-ah, ah-ah.
Unless ye be married, there will be no holding of hands.
Jeez, ye be really into this.
Ahh!
- What was that?
It came from the attic.
Libby, what's wrong?
She did this to me.
Jenny's spectre flew in through the window and braided my hair.
- Why?
- To make me look dorky.
Her spirit also threw my shoes out the window.
And I'll prove it.
There, see what Jenny's stupid spectre did to my shoes?
I wasn't lying.
That's proof.
- Of what?
- That Jenny's card says witch.
That's ridiculous.
Jenny's not a witch.
True or false, Puritans would have taken these allegations very seriously.
That's right.
So as Puritans, you have a choice: You can either deal with the witch accusation or go back to your chores.
- I saw Jenny with the devil.
- I saw Jenny with the devil.
I saw Jenny with the devil.
- Witch.
Witch.
Witch.
- Hey, guys, what's going on?
- Get her.
- Come on, run.
Witch, witch, witch.
What was that all about?
- They think you're a witch.
- Really?
Cool.
Maybe in some circumstances, but not right now.
So just tell me, did your card say witch?
Nope.
Townsperson.
Great, then you're off the hook.
Just show it to them.
I can't.
I spit my gum out in it.
How could you?
That's what the wrapper's for.
- Why are you getting so worked up?
- Because they're persecuting you.
If they can do this to you, they can do it to anyone.
It's just a game.
Yeah, but what if you were a witch and this wasn't a game?
Goody Kelley, you're wanted in the meeting house.
It's time for your trial.
Why couldn't we have just re-created Thanksgiving?
Let's begin the trial.
Bring in the accused witch, Jennifer Kelley.
Cold.
Cold.
She's making me cold.
- Cold, cold, cold.
- Cold, cold, cold.
Oh, put a sweater on.
All right, Jennifer Kelley, you are accused of being a witch.
- Do you confess it?
- No.
But didn't your spectre twist Goody Chessler's hair and toss her shoes?
No, I'm pretty sure my spectre was with me the whole time.
Where were you?
You weren't in the dining hall when Libby screamed.
She was with Adam.
Unescorted.
How unseemly.
- We were just talking.
- About what?
I can't say.
I've been sworn to secrecy.
- There are no secrets from the court.
- Then ask Jill if that's her real nose.
Silence.
Jill's nose is not on trial here.
You will tell the court what you were discussing, Jenny, or be held in contempt.
Do with me what you may, I will not betray a trust.
That's enough.
I'm really proud of the way you stood up to everyone.
Thanks.
- Did they find the key yet?
- No.
Man, I wish I really was a witch.
I'd zap open these stocks and broomstick it out of here.
Hey, there's Adam.
I'll go talk to him.
'Tis a providence you're here.
- Where've you been?
- Walking in the woods.
- What happened?
- She's been accused of being a witch because she won't tell the court what you were talking about.
Your secret's safe with me.
I'll tell the court.
Ye will not suffer on my account.
No, don't.
Besides, they would have found out Monday.
We have new evidence.
Adam will testify.
What say you?
Mr. Pool, today at lunch I did speak with Jenny.
And what was the nature of your conversation?
This is kind of hard for me, but I've decided to quit baseball.
What?
You're our best shortstop.
Why would you do that?
- Witchcraft.
- Witchcraft.
Witchcraft.
No, no.
I just wanted to spend more time on my studies.
Jenny has witched him.
She's turned a man against sports.
Don't blame Jenny.
Blame coach.
He's insane.
Witchcraft.
Witchcraft.
Listen to yourselves.
You have no proof Jenny's a witch.
We have no proof she isn't either.
And that's good enough for me.
But that's ridiculous.
You could say that about anyone in this room.
Ow!
She's pinching me.
She's pinching me.
- Jenny, stop pinching Libby.
- Not Jenny, Sabrina.
What?
I'm not doing anything.
Yes, you are.
Ow!
Ow.
Ow, ow, ow She has a witch card.
Sabrina is a witch.
Me, a witch?
That's ridiculous.
- So you deny it?
- Well, I-- I'm not even gonna dignify that with an answer.
Because you're a witch.
- Stop saying that.
- Witch.
- Careful or I'll-- - What, hex me?
Witch.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The only witch in this room is you.
What just happened?
- I can explain it.
- You can?
Oh, good.
Yes, I may be wearing funny clothes, but I'm still a science teacher.
And what we just saw was ball lightning.
A very rare and unusual phenomenon.
Aren't we lucky?
Lucky?
It almost killed me.
But it didn't.
Let the record show it didn't.
I think that's enough for today.
Tomorrow they'll be more candle making, cow milking and the trial of Sabrina.
Hello, Aunt Zelda?
Oh, Sabrina.
We were just sitting down to chilli.
Everything is crazy.
I don't like it.
You have to get me.
Slow down, you're hard enough to understand when you're not agitated.
I want you to come get me.
- Don't you like Salem?
- No, please come get me.
What's going on?
I'll tell you when you come get me.
And don't fly.
Drive.
You two arriving on vacuums is not gonna help.
We have to go.
Sabrina needs us.
Oh, all right.
Sorry guys.
Salem, you're in charge.
Yes.
Control.
Chilli.
I have it all.
I still don't get why you're taking off.
There's just something about this town.
Oh, there are my aunts.
Well, it's been fun.
Bye, Harvey.
- Come on.
Stay.
- I can't, sorry.
See you Monday.
Hi, Sabrina.
We would have been here sooner, but your aunt drives like an 800-year-old lady.
- Well, let's hit the road.
- Not so fast.
What's going on?
Well, we've been doing this role-playing game-- - Well, that sounds like fun.
- No, it's not.
People think I got a witch card.
They've accused me of being a witch.
I tell you, this town needs a disco.
So do you have a witch card?
I don't know.
I didn't even look at mine and I have no idea where it is.
This is new.
Mortals have been accusing each other for centuries, but I think this may be the first time they actually got a real witch.
It's supposed to be a game, but it doesn't feel like one.
They think being a witch is a bad thing.
Oh, you know it isn't.
Then why can't I tell people I am one for real?
Not a good idea.
Trust me, they won't understand.
Well, they almost found out today.
I came this close to blowing my cover.
And if I take the stand tomorrow, I can't honestly claim my innocence.
- And then what?
- Sabrina, calm down.
There's a lesson to be learned here and you're going to stay and learn it.
- You're not gonna take me home?
- No.
Can you at least give me a hint of what the lesson is?
It's about accepting who you are.
But I don't know who I am.
I lost my card.
You don't need a card to tell you who you are.
- That's right.
- What's right?
You know what's right.
And now it's time for us to go home to our chilli.
Everything will be fine.
So you drove an hour to give me some vague platitudes?
- That's what being a parent is.
- You'll thank us when you're 40.
Not if they hang me, I won't.
I'm really glad you stayed.
How could I miss doing chores and standing trial?
- Harvey, could I ask you a question?
- Is it about my feelings?
Yes.
Okay.
If I were a witch, would you still like me?
You got the witch card.
No.
Forget about the game.
What if I were a real witch?
Would you have supernatural powers?
- Yeah.
- How could I not like that?
So, what kind of things would you do?
Hmm.
I might turn Libby into a goat, or change my clothes a lot, or make a giant flan.
That's all?
- Wouldn't you wanna do cooler stuff?
- Like what?
Like create a big freaky machine that could fly, or make pizza, or-- See, it's not so easy.
Sabrina, it's time for your trial.
Wish me luck.
Is my bonnet on straight?
- All set.
- Great.
The cart will be here in a moment.
Witch, witch, witch!
Hey, watch it with the cabbage.
- Itchy.
Itchy.
She's making us itchy.
- Itchy.
We're in wool.
We're all itchy.
We will continue with the trial of Goody Spellman.
Goody Chessler has accused you of being a witch.
- Do you confess it?
- Yep.
- You do?
- Uh-huh.
I'm a witch, but I lost my card, so I guess I'm not a card-carrying witch.
Ha, ha.
But I am a witch.
All right, then, I guess that's it.
Just sign this confession and we'll begin shunning you.
Wait.
What are you saying?
You're not a witch.
That was a false confession.
Harvey, I have no problem saying I'm a witch.
But I know it's not true.
I mean, look at this face.
Is this the face of a witch?
No.
Witches are horrible, ugly things and they melt when you throw water on them.
Look.
See, she's still there.
Thanks, Harvey.
But what you just described is a stereotype.
How do you know witches are ugly?
- Have you ever seen one?
- No.
Well, maybe you fear witches because you've never met any.
Yes, witches are different from mortals, but different isn't bad.
I mean, maybe there are witches among us right now, but we're so closed-minded they can't tell us who they are.
And we're the ones missing out.
Because if we just accepted witches, maybe there'd be a big pizza party right now.
So I ask you, can we accept witches?
No!
No, down with witches.
Aunt Hilda was right.
Order.
Order.
That was a lovely speech, Sabrina, but the bus will be here soon and it's time for the group to pass judgement on you and Jenny.
Please stand before us.
Goody Kelley, you have been accused of being a witch and have been given a chance to defend yourself.
Who here believes Jenny has a witch card?
Take that as a yes.
Oh, man, is this going on my record?
Goody Spellman, you have been accused of being a witch and have been given a chance to defend yourself.
Who here believes Sabrina has a witch card?
The mob has spoken.
The court finds Jenny guilty of being a witch, but is letting Sabrina off for lack of enthusiasm.
But I confessed.
I confessed.
Nice try, Sabrina.
No one can accept you're a witch.
Oh, they are never getting a pizza party now.
So how will Jenny be punished?
Libby, we're not gonna punish Jenny.
After what her spectre put me through?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, you can pretend we hanged her.
That's not good enough.
Shouldn't she at least have to sit in the stocks until the bus comes?
I mean, she's a witch.
And we hate witches.
I'm cold.
Really cold.
- Aren't you guys?
- No.
Maybe I'm a little chilly.
Oh, I just got a wet willy.
This is witchcraft.
Libby, you're taking this too far.
But you have to believe me.
Ah.
There's a monkey on my shoulder.
There's a monkey on my shoulder.
Get it off me.
Get it off me.
Libby, there's no monkey on your shoulder.
Okay, look, I was making it up before, but now I really see a monkey.
Did you hear that?
She was making it up.
- Of course I was.
- So you confess?
You were just pretending to be cold and itchy and dorky?
Yes.
Yes.
Now, can we please deal with the monkey on my shoulder?
In a second.
First, given new evidence that Libby was making stuff up we will reverse Jenny's conviction.
My spectre and I thank you.
And for perjury, Libby will spend the day in the stocks until the bus comes.
Whoo-hoo!
Don't you see him?
It's wearing a fez and saying, "Ook!
Ook"!
I think my mom's really gonna like this homemade butter.
I got a kitchen witch for my aunts.
Oh, no, my nose is itchy.
I'll help you out there, buddy.
Oh, I just hit the bottom of the well.
I hope you enjoyed your stay at Salem.
But before we get on the bus, I want to let you in on a secret.
What we've been studying, it's not just 17th century life, but human nature.
The persecution and the hysteria of 300 years ago arose again today.
And all it took was an idea planted in your head.
The idea that someone different was among you.
It wasn't just an idea.
I did see a monkey.
And that's what hysteria can do to you.
So who did have the witch cards?
No one had the witch card.
Every single card said townsperson.
I didn't create the witches.
You did.
Now, think about that on the ride home.
So should we do that last seven bottles or go back to 99?
I don't know.
I'm just gonna sleep the whole way back.
So that's where my card went.
My proof was here the whole time.
A kitchen witch.
Sabrina, thank you.
That was very thoughtful.
We'll hang it over the cauldron.
I thought you'd like it.
So are you glad you stayed at Salem?
Yeah.
It was a pretty freaky weekend, though.
But you guys were right, I learned a lesson.
- What lesson?
- The lesson.
Oh, that lesson.
- I'll get more pie.
- Wait.
Don't get up.
It's so good to be home and be myself again.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
- Salem?
- Huh?
Glee Club.
Oh, man, don't do that to me.
Sorry, but I need a favour.
- See, I haven't had a date in weeks.
- No.
Come on, you've done it before.
- Well, I'm not doing it again.
- I'll make it worth your while.
Okay, but it's gonna cost you.
Here's your cat, ma'am.
I can't believe he did that.
Bad kitty.
Cats aren't the brightest animals.
You are so right.
- Are you okay?
- No.
I'm fine.
Now, how can I ever thank you?
Oh, look.
A freshly baked, homemade seven layer cake.
Would you like some?
Was it made by a single gal?
Yes, sirree.
Then I'll just put my ladder away and be right back.
Good work, Salem.
Show me the tuna.
You gotta show me the tuna Say "I love the black cat" - I love the black cat.
- I can't hear you.
- I love the black cat!
- I love the black cat.
When I go out, I like to go Dutch.
Genetics will be on the final.
Everything we studied this semester will be on the final.
Including what mitosis is.
It's not fair.
We only get three days to learn a whole semester's worth of biology.
I guess we were supposed to be learning it all along.
I wish I could read my notes.
Can you decipher this?
Mitosis is Nope.
I'm doomed.
Look, you can borrow my notes.
We'll get through finals together.
Well, if it isn't the cutest couple in the sophomore class.
Jeez, Libby, you're running out of insults.
No.
I'm on the yearbook committee, and I just thought you'd like to know you've been voted Cutest Couple.
I'd like to thank the Academy.
You're being very brave about this, Sabrina, considering the curse.
What curse?
Every couple who ever won the award broke up by the first day of finals.
- That's ridiculous.
- And sad.
Well, you don't think there's a curse, do you?
No, we're solid as a rock.
Curses belong in fairy tales along with giant beanstalks and witches.
Zelda, will you do me a favour and choke on this bread?
- What?
- I can't think of any other way to see my fireman again.
You choke.
He Heimlichs.
We go dancing.
Hilda, it's wrong to distract a fireman from his public duty.
Hey, I pay taxes.
Oh, thank goodness you're home.
- Choke on this.
- Gladly.
Stop that.
Is everything okay?
It depends on whether curses are real or not.
See, Harvey and I got voted the Cutest Couple.
- No, oh, no.
- What?
Oh, nothing.
She's just excited for you.
Don't you worry about this curse.
- You're gonna be fine.
- Really?
Absolutely.
Cool.
Then all I have to worry about is finals.
What are you saying?
You know curses count double for witches.
There's nothing Sabrina can do about it and knowing just makes it worse.
Curses.
Hurry up, Sabrina.
You're gonna miss the bus.
Oh, Salem, have you seen my biology notes?
Nope, sports section's lining my box this week.
But I need them.
Chill, little witch.
Just use a finding spell in your magic book.
Ah.
Here we go.
"Finder of lost things, help me find my enter lost item here".
Oh.
Finder of lost things, help me find My biology notes - I'm here.
- Who are you?
Roland, Finder of Lost Things.
Local 134.
Nice to meet you.
If you just sign this contract, I'll be happy to get right to work.
It's really long.
That's just to cover us in the event I get trapped under something heavy.
There.
Okay, stand back please.
Ah-ha.
I found your notes and 50 cents.
Thanks.
Here you go.
Get yourself something nice.
I'm not looking for a gratuity.
Just my standard fee.
- What's that?
- Anything in this room.
It says so right in that contract.
Anything?
Well, I have quite a selection.
How about this lovely paperweight?
I don't need a paperweight.
How's this bed?
Kind of lumpy.
Oh, I love this clock radio.
Could your hurry up?
I'm late for class.
You know, you're kind of cute when you pout.
Could you just decide?
Okay, I know what I want.
- You.
- Me?
I want your hand in marriage.
I'm only 16.
I know you're kind of old, but that's okay.
I don't have time.
There's a troll in my room.
I'll tell you later.
Did she say troll?
Intestinal peristaltic action moves food through the body, making digestion both a mechanical and chemical process.
- Yes, Jenny.
- Did we even study that?
For a week.
Who's that?
Oh, no.
May I help you?
I'm here to see Sabrina.
Personal matter.
She's in the middle of class.
I'll wait.
Mind if I have a seat?
Oh, he's an actor.
You can catch him at the Renaissance Faire.
Can we get back to learning?
How long is the large intestine?
- Oh, oh, call me.
Call me.
- Yes?
The large intestine is over two miles long.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
- It's 5 feet max.
- What do you know?
He's the teacher.
I'm telling you, human beings do not have four stomachs.
Let's open you up and find out.
Leave me alone.
That's all for today.
I'm not finished yet.
Who is that guy?
Oh, it's a really funny story.
I'll tell you about it later.
I gotta go.
So do you want a big wedding or just the family?
We're not getting married.
- Hey, Harvey, come sit with us.
- Who's that?
- My boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?
- Hi, guys.
- Harvey, this is Roland.
- Nice to meet you.
- Get lost, farm boy.
Farm boy?
I've never been on a farm in my life.
Well, I find that hard to believe, farm boy.
My name's Harvey.
Harvey, the farm boy.
Why don't you back off?
Why don't you make me?
It's go time, goober.
I'm not gonna fight you.
Oh, chicken.
Make you think of the farm, farm boy?
- That's it.
- Stop.
Roland, quit it and get off the table.
Sabrina, what's going on?
It's a funny story.
I'll tell you about it later.
Come on.
Come on.
I think you could have taken him.
That was surreal.
I have no idea what just happened.
Oh, it's the curse.
I'm afraid you and Sabrina are going down.
Why do we have to be so cute?
And get in there and no more fights, do you understand?
Okay, okay.
Henpecked already.
And I love it.
Oh, I'm exhausted.
Mind if I make myself comfortable?
So she did say "troll".
- What's he doing here?
- I'll tell you in the kitchen.
Go.
Go.
Go.
So, what do I do now?
We'd better call a lawyer.
This contract looks authentic.
Do you know any troll specialists?
We'll look one up in the Purple Pages.
Stuart Clarkson here.
You have a legal emergency?
A troll has asked for my hand in marriage.
- Did you sign a contract?
- Yes.
- Did you read the contract?
- No.
- Have a nice wedding.
- Wait.
You can't go.
You have to help us.
But you're asking me to break a legitimate contract.
Isn't that what lawyers do?
Right!
Where's the paperwork?
Hopeless.
Hopeless.
- I am not getting married.
- According to this you are.
- Oh, no.
- What?
Sorry, misread a word.
It's "dearth," not "death".
Oh, man, I am sweating up a storm.
Do you mind if I take off my jacket and pants?
- Your pants?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
I'm wearing a four-piece suit.
- Hey.
- Harvey.
You left in kind of a hurry.
Can I come in and talk?
No.
Why don't we just step outside?
Oh, this is nice, the great outdoors.
So, what did you wanna talk about?
Who's that guy who tried to beat me up at school today?
Roland.
That's a funny story.
I'll tell you later.
It is later.
Well, he's a friend of my aunts.
- That's the funny story?
- I don't tell it very well.
Why do I feel you're keeping something from me?
I can't really talk about it.
It's too weird.
Sabrina, I'm your boyfriend.
Do you want us to keep secrets from each other?
- No.
- So can you tell me who Roland is?
- No.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
Harvey.
Roland.
Roland.
Glee Club.
- Roland, can I talk to you?
- Of course.
Communication is the foundation of any marriage.
I'm not marrying you.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I'm not marrying you.
Look, I'm very flattered that you chose me over a clock radio.
- But this is not my idea of romance.
- And farm boy is?
Yes.
Harvey and I happen to be an award-winning couple.
- And even though we're fighting now-- - You are?
We'll work it out because Harvey and I were meant to be together.
So my love goes unrequited?
I guess there's no reason for me to carry on this charade.
You still deserve your fee for finding my notes.
- Want that clock radio?
- No.
Can I say something?
I've found a lot of things in my life, but I guess I'm still looking for love.
Goodbye.
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing, I just-- - Look, he left his hat.
- You'd better take it to him.
It completes his outfit.
- I'll be right back.
- See you.
Hello?
Roland?
What do you want?
You forgot your hat.
Who cares?
Look, I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you planned.
Well, I gotta go study.
- It's stuck.
- No, it's locked.
- And you're trapped in here forever.
- You tricked me?
Sabrina, I'm a finder, not a loser.
- Oh, no.
So when should we have the wedding?
- Never.
- I think June would be better.
- You can't keep me here.
- Oh, yes I can.
Faster.
Faster.
Please, I am dealing with some incredibly big words.
Guys, Sabrina went to return Roland's hat an hour ago and she hasn't come back yet.
Oh, no.
That old troll trick.
And it's perfectly legal.
It took me two days, but I found that needle in a haystack.
Don't you ever talk about anything but work?
That must be the wedding coordinator.
My aunts.
You've come to rescue me?
Actually, no, but we're working on getting you out.
Good luck.
It's an ironclad contract.
Yes, but we have a lawyer with great legs.
And in the meantime, we brought Sabrina her schoolbooks.
Woo-hoo.
I'm engaged to a troll and I get to study for finals.
Okay, visiting hours are over.
Once we're family, you're welcome in my house anytime.
But for now, vamoose.
Don't worry.
We'll get you out.
Before Friday or I'll fail biology.
Forget homework.
You're my princess now.
I can dress myself.
Hopeless.
Hopeless.
- Oh, ho.
Buried clause.
- Is that good?
"The party of the first part may be rescued by a prince she desires".
- This may be the way out.
- That's great.
Do we know any princes?
I'll set up some interviews.
Under special skills, it says wall climbing?
- Oh, that's old.
- What about dragon slaying?
I haven't done it in years.
Look, I know I've let myself go, but I think I can handle a troll.
Do I smell pie?
Look, I know 12 different ways of killing you both without leaving my chair.
So when do I start?
Isis, you are our most qualified applicant, but we still can't use you.
- It's because I'm a woman, isn't it?
- Well, yes.
This makes me so-- No, I'm gonna save this anger for my support group.
Do you want some juice?
Okay, we're looking for a prince to save our niece from a troll.
It could involve some swordplay, and there is no guarantee that you'll come back alive.
I don't wanna die.
Don't cry.
Do you want your mom?
Shall we get the queen?
Hi, is Sabrina home?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Well, when you see her, could you tell her that I've thought about it and I'm willing to accept whatever weird situation she's in.
That's all.
See you.
Harvey, would you come in for a moment?
Sure.
I couldn't help but notice your jacket.
Who is the "Termite King"?
My dad.
That's his company.
Which would make you the Termite Prince.
And that's why I'm leaving the area when I go to college.
Will you excuse me?
There's hope.
The Termite Prince will stand up in a court of troll.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
The only problem is, Harvey's mortal.
Do we have the fixings for a memory loss potion?
Do we?
I see you two in a gazebo, draped in wisteria.
I'm loving it.
With garlands in her hair and yours.
Divine.
I have an idea.
Why don't you two get married?
I see the bride has a case of cold feet.
Poor Sabrina.
Maybe I shouldn't put you through all the stress of this.
- You mean--?
- Yes.
Let's move the wedding up to tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Somebody help me.
Help.
Mmm.
Cinnamon-y.
What we're about to tell you is strange.
So I hope you can accept it.
I'm drinking from a chalice in front of a guy with no pants.
I'm trying.
So, what's the truth?
Sabrina's a witch and she's being held captive by a troll in his castle and only a prince who she loves can save her.
That's all?
So the quest starts with me going through the linen closet?
Yes.
Wait, your clothes are all wrong.
I don't have to dress like this forever, do I?
No, just until you vanquish the troll.
I couldn't vanquish the troll in pants?
Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
- Harvey?
Sabrina.
- Harvey.
- How's it going?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm supposed to vanquish the troll.
Come on up.
I can't.
The door is locked.
There must be a way.
We have to think fairy tale.
I've got it.
Harvey, climb up my hair.
You're okay with that?
Yeah.
Just don't split any ends.
?
HARVEY : I'm almost there.
Hurry up.
I made it.
My prince has come.
You look great with long hair.
It's a lot of upkeep.
Let me look at you.
So I guess this means you know how weird my life is.
Your aunts told me.
I figured as much when I saw you in tights.
They're kind of bunching on me.
Sweetheart, look what the Billy Goats sent us.
Quick.
Hide.
I've gotta get rid of this hair.
It's a blender.
What's he doing here?
Oh, right, you're good at finding things.
Where's my sword?
Where's my sword?
Ah-ha.
I found it.
Sabrina, what do I do?
Draw your sword.
- Now what do I do?
- Use it.
Take that.
Take it back.
Watch out.
Time-out.
Time-out.
Time in.
- Where'd he go?
- To your left.
Over here, farm boy.
I hate that name.
Don't worry, Harvey.
Here comes the air support.
Honey, that almost hit me.
What are you doing?
Hey, I'm duelling down here.
You've taken your last breath.
My aim is true.
Bull's-eye.
And to think I complained about lugging that around all year.
Harvey.
Harvey.
What happened?
Sabrina, did you do this to me?
Sorry, Roland, but consider yourself vanquished.
You're a very complicated woman.
And more trouble than you're worth.
The marriage is off.
And if anyone asks, I dumped you.
- We did it.
- Let's frolic.
- Wait.
What day is it?
- Thursday.
We've got our biology test tomorrow.
We've got to study.
Move it.
Sabrina, you're back.
Harvey saved me, and now he knows everything.
Yep.
Sabrina's a witch.
You're a witch.
Your sister's a witch.
It all makes sense.
But only for 15 more seconds.
Then the knowledge will be erased from his memory forever.
But I like it like this.
We have no secrets from each other.
Then for the next five seconds, you have a perfect relationship.
That doesn't give me much time, but I always knew there was something magical about you, Sabrina.
And now--  What was I saying?
You were telling me what mitosis is.
Right.
What is it?
And initial here.
I found this pen, you know?
Sabrina is now free and clear to marry whoever she wants.
In return, you are entitled to her clock radio.
I didn't really want it.
I just took it to hurt her.
It's the first day of finals.
What are you doing holding hands?
- We survived the curse.
- How?
It's a funny story.
I'll tell you about it later.
You have 50 minutes.
Don't start until everyone has a test.
Sabrina, good luck.
You too.
And don't forget, mitosis is-- - You may begin.
- The process of cell division.
Sabrina, we have a surprise.
Since you did so well on your finals, we think you deserve a reward.
I've been thinking that too.
So where are we going?
Tony Roma's?
No.
- What's going on?
- It's an around-the-world tour available only to witches who ace biology.
- And their relatives.
- First stop: Spain.
OlÃ©.
They left me behind.
Be strong.
Don't cry.
I can't believe we almost forgot you.
What?
Had you left?
Yes.
Now we have to catch up with the others.
OlÃ©.
