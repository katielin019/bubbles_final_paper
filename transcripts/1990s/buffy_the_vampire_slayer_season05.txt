{START OF EPISODE 1}
Touchdown.
Oh, yeah.
Go, Team Me.
Anybody ever told Team You the quarterbackthrows like a girl?
I do?
Sorry.
No, don'tyou I'm exhausted just looking at those two.
All the splashing and jumping and running.
Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
Absolutely.
Exertion can lead to sweatiness.
Which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness.
Better to just stay put.
I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
Game over?
Buffy slayed the football.
- Where's my burger?
- Yeah, man, I'm starving.
Cow me.
The fire's not cooperating.
It's comforting to knowthat I lack the culinary finesse of a caveman.
Ignis, incende.
Willow, check you out.
Witch fu.
It's no big.
You just balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing I didn't do it.
- Come on, hurry it up.
I'm getting soaked.
- I'm trying.
This thing weighs.
Nice.
Good job.
Look at this.
The guy's carting dirt around.
Leave it.
We'll turn it on its side.
Dirt.
Man, rich people are There you go.
All set.
Thank you, Willow.
Obstinate bloody machine simply refused to work for me.
Just call me the Computer Whisperer.
Let's get scanning.
I wanna see this puppy go.
- Start with those.
- Start?
Where is finish?
It's essential we begin to archive the library.
Most of these texts have no duplicates.
But now?
Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season?
Well, you don't have to, Willow.
I mean, you're welcome to leave if No.
It's fine.
It's justyou've been Mr Project all summer, you know?
Labelling the amulets and indexing your diaries.
I drawthe line at making giant rubber-band balls.
That's when you'll just have to get a life.
That's what I'm trying to do, actually, is get a life.
- It might go better if you left the house.
- Willow you mustn't repeat what I'm about to say.
Especially not to Buffy.
- You promise?
- Oh, God.
I guess.
Nowthat I knowthere's something to know, I can't not know, just because I'm afraid somebody'll know I know, you know?
- Did that mean yes?
- Yeah.
We're doing this because I wantyou all to have everything you need atyour fingertips.
You see, I'm going backto England.
You're what?
Butyou can't.
You're Buffy's watcher.
I mean, in a fired way, but It's obvious that Buffy doesn't need me any more.
I don't say that in a self-pitying way.
I'm quite proud, actually.
But what about the rest of us?
We still need to be watched.
Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
I appreciate the sentiment, but it's just not so.
You'll be fine.
You all will.
And we'll stay in touch.
You can always call me whenever you like.
When are you gonna tell Buffy?
Soon.
It won't be easy, but I know she'll understand.
Thanks, Mom.
Everything was yummy.
You up for dessert?
We could take a drive, get some ice cream.
You know, I would but I kinda have to get out on patrol.
Now?
It's 8.30.
Vamps don't really care what time it is.
You know, dark equals dinner bell.
Right.
Of course.
You know, I'm gonna have to get used to this place withoutyou again.
It gets so quiet.
Maybe we should make a regular date of this when school starts.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
It's a total drag.
Very impressive hunt.
Such power.
That was no hunt.
That was just another day on the job.
Care to step up for some overtime?
We're not going to fight.
- Do you know what a slayer is?
- Do you?
Who are you?
I apologise.
I assumed you knew.
I am Dracula.
Get out.
Xand, what if somebody had a secret and that somebody promised somebody else that they wouldn't tell anyone?
Newsflash, Will.
Everybody knows.
No, this isn't about me and Tara.
Not that I wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret.
Even if it was very, very naughty.
Sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety.
And I'm not telling you.
OK.
Wanna see if Buffy's hanging around the headstones?
Sure.
So if I was gonna tell you, which I'm not going to So let me get this straight.
You're "Dracula".
The guy.
The Count.
- I am.
- This isn't just some fan-boy thing?
Cos I've fought a lot of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves Lestat.
You know who I am.
As I would know without question thatyou are Buffy Summers.
You've heard of me?
Naturally.
You're known throughout the world.
No.
Really?
Why else would I come here?
For the sun?
I came to meet the renowned killer.
Yeah, I prefer the term "slayer".
"Killer" just sounds so Naked?
Like I paint clowns or something.
I'm the good guy, remember?
Perhaps, butyour power is rooted in darkness.
You must feel it.
No.
You know what I feel?
Bored.
OK, that's cheating.
Hey, Buff, what's up?
- You look like you just - Get out of here.
Now.
Fine.
I was gonna give you a sip of my double-mint mocha Behind you.
Hi.
Nice.
Look who's got a bad case of Dark Prince envy.
I have no interest in you.
Leave us.
No, we're not going to "leave you".
And where'd you get that accent?
Sesame Street?
Von, two, three three victims.
- Mah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Xander.
I'm pretty sure that's Dracula.
Wow, really?
Sorry, man.
I was just jokin' around.
This is not the time.
I will see you soon.
Bat.
Buffy's all "Look out"!
And then frigging Dracula's standing right behind us.
- And then he lunges at us, like, whoosh.
- He totally looked shorter in person.
I told you he'd heard of me.
Can you believe that?
Count Famous heard of me.
I couldn't believe it the first 20 times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.
I'm sorry.
Am I Repeat-O-Girl?
I was just blown away.
It's not that surprising that he's heard of you.
You are the Slayer.
I guess.
Just the way he said it, you know?
I mean, he made it sound so Sexy?
I bet he made it sound sexy.
Kinda.
He of the dark, penetrating eyes and lilty accent.
- I wonder if he knows Frankenstein.
- You thought Dracula was sexy?
No.
He was yuck.
Right.
Except for the whole tall, dark and handsome thing, yucko.
- How would you know?
- Well, we hung out a fewtimes.
Back in my demon days.
You know, once or twice.
He's pretty cool.
You know, from a whole evil-thing perspective.
Please.
He was no big whoop.
"No big whoop"?
What about when he turned himself into a bat?
That was awesome.
It must have been, yes.
I must admit, I'm sorry I missed that.
Me too.
The whole time I was thinking "I wish Giles were here.
He'd know what to do".
Didn'tyou guys thinkthat?
Actually, I was more thinking "Bat"!
- How come he can do that?
- I have no idea.
There's a great deal of myth about Dracula.
I imagine the trickto defeating him lies in separating the fact from the fiction.
Great point.
That is so Giles to think of something like that, you know?
That we would have never.
So we should take things slow with Dracula.
He said we would meet again, but I want to wait until we do some homework.
He may have a bunch of swell party tricks, but he's still just a vampire.
- Let's load up with stakes and go after him.
- Second.
Buffy's right.
Dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff.
So we hold off.
No killing until we know what we're dealing with.
You're not just saying that because of those dark penetrating eyes of his?
Are you?
No.
His eyes were They were There was no penetration.
Cross my heart.
All right.
Willow, you and Tara find out everything you can about the legend of Vlad the lmpaler on the Internet and I'll checkthe library.
The Initiative would have found everything in a few hours.
We may not be as fast, but we'll find him.
You guys'll reconvene here in the morning?
- What's your plan?
- Big sleep.
My Count encounter wiped me out.
I'm kinda wired.
Maybe I should just letyou getyour rest.
You sure?
I mean, maybe if you just lie down with me Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
I guess you're right.
I'll see you in the morning?
- With doughnuts.
- Heaven.
See?
A little sugar and I'm all yours.
Dracula schmacula.
I doubt he'd remember me.
I was just a silly young thing.
Like 700 or so.
But he did say that this guy I cursed was doomed for ever, which was really sweet, don'tyou think?
Adorable.
It was a great spell.
I made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human minivan.
You should just mention my name if you see him again.
Or why not sit on top of a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until Dracula shows up?
- Then you two can talk private.
- Don't tell me you're jealous.
No.
Just because you're panting over the guy.
I am not panting.
Now stop being silly.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- You don't wanna come backto my place?
- It's whites day.
The bleach smell makes me nauseous.
Fine.
I suppose Dracula doesn't use bleach?
He's a darks-only man.
Great.
Perfect.
You know what?
You're not so big.
One round of old-fashioned fisticuffs, I betyou'd fold like a bitty baby.
OK, let's do it.
And no poofing.
Come on, Puffy Shirt.
Pucker on up - Silence.
- Yes, master.
No, that's not You will be my emissary.
My eyes and ears in daylight.
- Your emissary?
- Serve me well, you will be rewarded.
I will make you an immortal.
A child of darkness that feeds on life itself, on blood.
Blood?
Yes.
I will serve you, Your Excellent Spookiness.
Or "master".
I'll stick with "master".
You are strange and off-putting.
Go now.
But, master, how can I find?
Brilliant.
What an exit.
Guy's a genius.
Well, well.
You can take the boy out of the Initiative, butyou can't take the Initiative out of the boy.
I'd put that down, unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache.
I can't be too careful.
I got quite a few demons after me these days.
I'm looking for some information.
Might pay a little.
I'll play.
What can you tell me about Dracula?
Dracula?
Poncy bugger owes me - You know him?
- Know him?
We're old rivals.
But then he got famous.
He forgot all about his foes.
I'll tell you what.
That glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer.
His story gets out and suddenly everybody knows howto kill us.
The mirror bit?
But he's not just a regular vampire.
He has special powers, right?
Nothing but showy gypsy stuff.
What's it to you, anyway?
He's in town.
Making his presence known.
Drac's in Sunnydale?
I guess the old boy needed closure after all.
Actually, he's gunning for Buffy.
But I'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her.
Tough talk, cowboy.
Butyou're not gonna catch him napping in a crypt.
The Count has to have his luxury estate and his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?
You're saying I should check out mansions?
That sort of thing?
No.
I'm saying you should go home to your superhoney.
Have a nice, safe snog.
You're out of your depth on this one, boy.
You've helped Buffy before, so she has a problem with killing you now you're helpless.
I don't.
I'd like to see you try.
Would you?
You're never gonna find him.
Not before he gets to her.
You are magnificent.
I betyou say that before you bite all the girls.
No, you are different.
Kindred.
Kindred?
Hardly, I Pull your hair back.
This isn't how I usually fight.
You think you can just waft in here with your music-video wind and your hypno eyes I have searched the world over for you.
I have yearned for you.
For a creature whose darkness rivals my own.
You have been tasted.
- He was - Unworthy.
He letyou go.
But the embrace, his bite, you remember.
No.
Do not fight.
I can feel your hunger.
- Here's a jelly one.
You want it?
- No.
Got it.
Mine.
Well, I think we have Dracula factoids.
Like any of that's enough to fight the Dark Master.
- Baiter.
- A lot of it we already knew.
Turn-offs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic.
Turn-ons: nice duds, minions, long, slow bites that last for days.
Yeah, I did a little research, too.
Dracula likes to live in style.
Which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt.
He's smart enough to figure that we knowthat.
I say he's laying low.
Actually, my research backs Riley up.
Drac isn't the lay-lowtype.
So we can check out the nicer places.
Don'tyou think, Buffy?
Buffy?
Yeah.
We'll check all the swanky places first.
What else did you guys get?
Well, Willow has most of it, actually.
Only because you gave me super pointers.
- I would never - Just go ahead, Willow.
OK.
Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires.
He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims.
And he has all of these mental powers to drawthem in.
He can read and control minds, and appear in dreams.
Makes sense.
That stare He just kinda looked right through you.
Didn'tyou feel it, Buffy?
No, I didn't.
See.
Buffy didn't feel it.
I think you're drawing a lot of crazy conclusions about the Unholy Prince.
Baiter.
The point is, though he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, the end result is the same - he turns them into a vampire.
Well.
That is intimate.
Dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood.
And blood is life.
According to them.
Just be aware that he tends to form a relationship with his prey.
It's not enough for him to take her.
She must want to be taken.
She must burn for him.
That's interesting.
I'm gonna go find him.
You shouldn't go by yourself.
He's dangerous.
It's cool, I got it.
Take off that scarf.
What?
No.
You're under the thrall of the Dark Prince.
I am not under the thrall of the Dark Prince.
Then take off the scarf.
Let go of me.
This is ridiculous.
- Why didn'tyou say anything?
- She didn't want to worry us.
- It's just a scratch.
- Two deep puncture-y scratches.
I'm not sure why I tried to hide it.
There was just this voice and it was telling me to cover it.
And what did I tell you?
That's thrall.
Like Dracula has mind control over her?
You're watching too many creature features.
It does seem like he has this control over me, even though a big part of me is resisting.
No, it's OK.
I shouldn't take this personally.
What with Angel, it's understandable that there would be transference.
I mean, they're both broody immortals.
I am not transfer-y.
I swear to you.
I'm your girl and I'm gonna stay that way.
OK.
Butyou are not going anywhere near him again.
Riley's right.
You should stay out of sight.
Let the rest of us look for Dracula.
I can't go home.
He already got inside once.
Come to my place.
I'll make sure you stay put.
Good.
Riley and I can search for Dracula, and Willow, you and Tara could do a protection spell at Buffy's house, prevent him from returning.
Got it.
How'd he get inside anyway?
He seemed so nice and normal.
A little pale.
A good Sunnydale rule of thumb: avoid white-skinned men in capes.
I'm not like this.
I don't invite strange men over for coffee.
It's just When you girls are older, you'll understand.
It's hard to date.
Sometimes you just feel like giving up on men altogether.
Another bust.
It's getting dark.
I should have turned up a better lead.
There must be an easier way to find him.
Too late to worry about that now.
If we hurry, we can hit these last places.
How come I have to slayer-sit while the others get to look for Dracula?
- I mean, just because I'm - What time is it?
Almost six.
I mean, I'm the one who knows him.
I'm the one who had a good look at him, so I'm supposed to deliver you to the master now.
There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal.
You cool with that?
Take me to him.
Come on, Xander.
This isn't funny.
Master?
I deliver the Slayer.
She who you most desire.
Sorry.
"Whom".
Now comes the immortality, right?
You do the thing Leave us.
We must not be interrupted.
You bet.
I knew you'd come.
Why?
Because I'm under your thrall?
Well, guess again, pal.
- Put the stake down.
- OK.
Right.
That was notyou.
I did that because I wanted to.
Maybe I should rethinkthat thrall thing.
I've lived in Sunnydale a couple of years now.
Know what I've never noticed before?
- A castle?
- A big honkin' castle.
Stay away from me.
Are you afraid I will bite you?
Slayer, that's why you came.
No.
Last night It's not gonna happen again.
Stop me.
Stake me.
I Any minute now.
Do you know why you cannot resist?
Cos you're famous?
Because you do not want to.
- My friends are - They're here.
They will not find us.
We are alone.
Always alone.
There is so much I have to teach you.
Your history.
Your power.
Whatyour body is capable of.
- I don't need to know.
- You long to.
And you will have eternity to discover yourself.
But first, a little taste.
I won't letyou.
I didn't mean for me.
Nobody harms my master.
- Your master?
- You want him?
You come through me.
Okey-dokey.
Good show, Giles.
At leastyou didn't get knocked out for a change.
Ladies.
You would be the three sisters, yes?
Excellent.
Right.
I'd heard thatyou were a myth.
Obviously erroneous.
That tickles.
Oh, dear God.
- What are you?
- All these years fighting us, your power so near to our own.
And you've never once wanted to know what it is that we fight for?
Never even a taste?
- If I drinkthat - I have not drunk enough for you to change.
You must be near death to become one of us.
And that comes only when you plead for it.
- I'm not hungry.
- No.
Your craving goes deeper than that.
You think you know whatyou are, what's to come.
You haven't even begun.
Find it.
The darkness.
Find your true nature.
Wow.
That was gross.
You are resisting.
- Looks like.
- Come here.
Come to me.
You know, I really thinkthe thrall has gone out of our relationship.
But I wanna thank you for opening up my eyes a little.
- What is this?
- My true nature.
You want a taste?
Buffy?
Are you in?
Giles.
- Come on.
Grab my hand.
- Thank God you came.
Come on.
There was no possible escape.
My shoe.
Silly me, I'll just pop No, sir.
No more chickpit for you.
Come on.
A guy like you should think about going electric.
Seriously.
How do you like my darkness now?
Buffy.
You OK?
Yeah.
Chock-full of free will.
And Dracula?
Eurotrashed.
Where's the creep that turned me into a spider-eating man-bitch?
He's gone.
Dammit.
You know what?
I'm sick of this crap.
I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis.
As of this moment, it's over.
I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey.
Check.
No more butt-monkey.
At leastyou weren't makin' time with the Dracu-babes, like Giles here.
I was not.
I was about to kill those loathsome creatures when Riley interrupted me.
Really?
You were gonna nuzzle 'em to death?
Of course not.
I was in complete control.
You think I don't watch your movies?
You always come back.
I'm standing right here.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.
Thanks for coming.
- Can I offer you some tea?
- No, thanks.
Cookies.
How come I rate little-cookie treatment?
Well, actually, I have something to tell you.
Actually, I have something that I'd like to talkto you about, too.
Well, you go first, by all means.
- No, go ahead.
- No, I insist.
You haven't been my watcher for a while.
I haven't been training and I haven't really needed to come to you for help.
I agree.
And then this whole thing with Dracula.
It made me face up to some stuff.
Ever since we did that spell where we called on the first slayer, I've been going out a lot.
- Every night.
- Patrolling?
Hunting.
That's what Dracula called it.
And he was right.
He understood my power better than I do.
He saw darkness in it.
I need to know more.
About where I come from.
About the other slayers.
Maybe if I can learn to control this thing, I could be stronger.
I could be better.
But I'm scared.
I know it's gonna be hard.
And I can't do it withoutyou.
I need your help.
I need you to be my watcher again.
Boy, I just keep talkin', don't I?
I'm sorry.
You had something you wanted to say?
No.
It's nothing.
Riley and I are going to the movies.
OK.
Have a good time.
What are you doing here?
Buffy?
If you're going out, why don'tyou take your sister?
Mom!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I've been going out a lot.
- Patrolling?
- Hunting.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": That's what Dracula called it.
And he was right.
He understood my power better than I do.
He saw darkness in it.
I need to know more.
About where I come from.
About the other slayers.
I need you to be my watcher again.
Dammit!
You know what?
I'm sick of this crap.
I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis.
As of this moment, it's over.
I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
What are you doing here?
Buffy?
If you're going out, why don'tyou take your sister?
Mom!
There is nothing butyou.
You are the centre.
And within you, there is the core of your being.
Of whatyou are.
Find it.
Breathe into it.
Focus inward.
Let the world fall away, fall away, fall away.
Can we go now?
Nobody knows who I am.
Not the real me.
It's like nobody cares enough to find out.
I mean, does anyone ever ask me what I want to do with my life?
Or what my opinion is on stuff?
Or what restaurant to order in from?
No.
Underline.
Exclamation point.
Exclamation point, exclamation point.
No one understands.
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
People wouldn't be so crazy about her if they had to live with her every single day.
Everybody cares what she thinks, just cos she can do backflips and stuff.
Like, that's such a crucial job skill in the real world.
Plus Mom lets her get away with everything.
"Your sister's saving the world".
I could so save the world if somebody handed me superpowers, but I'd think of a cool name and wear a mask to protect my loved ones, which Buffy doesn't even.
If this town wasn't so lame, everyone would know what she does.
I bet they wouldn't even be that impressed, because, like, killing things with wood?
Oh, scary vampires, they die from a splinter.
So, Buffy, what are your plans today?
Giles and I are gonna go to the magic shop for supplies for my newtraining sessions.
- That's great.
- Yeah, I'm actually You can take Dawn shopping for her back-to-school supplies.
- What?
- Mom, I thoughtyou were taking me.
Honey, I've got the Gurion showing tonight and there's so much to do to get the gallery ready.
No, but, see, Mom, that doesn't really work for me.
We're going to the magic shop.
No school supplies there.
Yeah, Mom, I'm not going to Hogwarts.
Jeez, crack a book sometime.
I'm sure Giles doesn't mind dropping you off at the mall afterward.
Actually, he does mind.
This is supposed to be quality watcher/slayer time.
I told you, she ruined my training yesterday.
- Did not!
- Oh, you know you did too.
Buffy, I realise the importance of your new slayer thing, but I could really use your help.
- Morning, Mrs Summers.
You look great.
- Oh, thank you, Riley.
- Suck-up.
- What?
It's a nice outfit.
Besides, "I'm here to violate your first-born" never goes over with parents.
Not sure why.
Riley, my sister's boyfriend, is so into her.
They're always kissing and groping.
I bet they've had sex.
- Hey, kid.
- I'm not a kid.
Well, this is a surprise of the nicest kind.
Now it's my turn to be surprised.
I thought we had plans today.
Plans?
We planned plans?
Well, you said "Come over tomorrow and we'll hang" and then I said "OK".
Not the invasion of Normandy, but still a plan.
Right.
- We're not hanging today, are we?
- Giles is on his way to pick me up.
- Slayer training.
- Slayer shopping, actually.
- But equally as important.
- I have no doubt.
- OK, we'll hook up later.
- Are you mad at me?
No, not at all.
I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way.
- Good.
- Look, Buffy, I know what this means to you.
I think it's great thatyou've got this new mission.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
- See ya, kid.
- I'm not a kid!
I sympathise with you, I truly do.
But I'm certain that Riley understands better than anyone the importance of training.
You can't allow personal concerns to distractyou Dawn, will you stop fiddling with the radio and sit down?
I don't think Buffy's watcher likes me too much.
I think it's cos he's just so old.
I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him use the word "newfangled" one time, so he's gotta be pretty far gone.
There's a lot of books on this list.
Any come on tape, read by George Clooney?
You're entering a new realm, one for which I myself am not entirely prepared.
- Are you ready for this commitment?
- I'm just kidding.
This Betty's ready.
Colour me committed.
- Blast!
- You put it in neutral again, huh?
I'm just not used to this automatic transmission.
I loathe this just sitting here, not contributing.
- No, it's not working out.
- Are you breaking up with your car?
Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty.
Little two-door tramp.
I don't know.
I was so at a loose end that I found myself searching for some way of feeling more Shallow?
Perhaps, as I am to be your watcher again, a modicum of respect might be in order.
Do I have to?
I'm serious, Buffy.
There's going to be far less time for the sort of flighty, frivolous - Hey, there's Willow and Tara!
- Ooh, they haven't seen my new car.
- Hey, Giles!
Sharp wheels!
- The rest of the car's nice, too.
- Handles like a dream.
- Where are you guys heading?
Magic shop.
I have some charms on back order.
- Willow, hi.
- Hey, Dawny!
How's my favourite chess partner?
Still leading with your knight?
Willow's awesome.
She's the only one I know who likes school as much as me.
Even her friends are cool.
- Hey, Dawn.
- Like Tara.
She and Willow are both witches.
They do spells and stuff, which is so much cooler than slaying.
I told Mom I wished they'd teach me some of the things they do together.
And then she got really quiet and made me go upstairs.
Huh.
I guess her generation isn't cool with witchcraft.
Giles and I worked out a schedule around school.
A block of time every day to just focus on my new slayer training.
That's a work ethic.
Buffy, you're developing a work ethic.
Oh, no.
Do they make an ointment for that?
People gotta respect a solid work ethic.
Look atyou.
Motivated Buffy.
Eager to soak up learning.
You and I are gonna have so much fun this semester.
That reminds me.
With the whole new training schedule, I had to drop a class.
Your slayer studies are way more important.
So I won't be taking drama with you.
- What?
You have to.
You promised!
- I know, but Giles said that it just was - The hell with Giles.
- I can hear you, Willow.
Drama is just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
You can blow off training Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
What about "people gotta respect a work ethic"?
Other people, not me.
There's a whole best-friend loophole.
Shop's kinda dark.
Maybe it's closed.
That's odd.
Well, I think "odd" just got upped to "bad".
Hello?
Anyone here?
Mr Bogarty?
The owner.
I come in here a lot.
Well, maybe this happened really late at night when nobody was Will?
I'm fine, I just tripped over Mr Bogarty.
- What is it?
Is he OK?
- Nothing you need to see.
Go wait outside.
I don't wanna wait outside.
Ow, that hurts!
You're hurting me.
I'm telling.
I don't have time for this.
Just do like I say and wait.
Here.
Whatyou doing?
What are you doing here?
You can't loiter.
There's no loitering.
That's why I'm a cat.
Quiet.
See, cat's in the cupboard, but they find you there anyway and it hurts.
Please make it stop.
- Shut up!
They'll hear you!
- Buffy!
I know you.
Curds and whey.
I know whatyou are.
You don't belong here.
Dawn?
Dawn?
Dawn, are you OK?
Is Is that guy dead in there?
Yeah.
They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing.
Best non-Scoobies like you and me stay out of their way.
Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
OK.
Judging by the bitefest, I'd say it was more than one vampire.
I make it four at least.
Someone's put together a newfang club.
I've crosschecked the inventory list and things are definitely missing, mostly books.
Including A Treatise on the Mythology and Methodology of the Vampire Slayer.
- Oh, shoot.
Was that the only copy?
- Come on, Buffy, this could be very serious.
Whoever's leading this pack of vampires is interested in learning more aboutyou.
Perhaps searching for weaknesses or Good Lord.
What?
Well, I had no idea the profit margins on a shop like this were so high.
Look at this.
Low-overhead out-of-state orders, international It's no wonder there's never any trouble attracting new owners.
- A place like this is a virtual - Deathtrap?
Well, yes, there is that, but still.
Location, you know, pedestrian traffic So what's the next step?
Buffy, you should begin looking for their lair straightaway.
- I'll get Riley to help me patrol.
- Aren'tyou forgetting something?
- lmpressive square footage.
- You're on Dawn duty.
Oh, duty.
I gotta drop my sister back at home.
My mother's gonna kill me.
I bet the death rate keeps the rent down.
Hello.
Something's been taken from this case.
- Look here.
- What'd they take?
I should think an item of value or power, possibly even A unicorn.
Ten-inch ceramic unicorn imported from Thailand.
- Was it valuable?
- List price: $12.95.
Which begs the question, what kind of creature fancies cheap, tasteless statuary?
OK, hi.
First of all, I wanna thank everybody for a really successful raid on the magic shop last night.
Good job, minions!
Yes, you deserve it.
Secondly, somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest little unicorn.
What?
Brad.
Guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in the tenth grade.
- I had to get her something.
She sired me.
- Sire-whipped.
Anyway, the books you brought me to help with the plan?
I've been skimming through the book jackets and there's some useful stuff in there, so Yes Sorry, forgotyour name.
- Cyrus.
- Cyrus, right.
Peaches's friend.
- What's your question?
- When are we gonna do it?
Eww!
That's rude!
I barely know you.
And you're a minion.
He means the plan.
When are we gonna do the plan?
The plan!
Let me tell you, I'm really psyched about it and I hope the rest of you guys - When?
- Tonight!
We kill the Slayer tonight.
So not only didn'tyou take your sister shopping, you brought her to a murder scene.
No, I didn't bring her to it.
It just sorta came upon us.
It's not like she sawthe body or anything.
Oh, well.
That makes it all right then, doesn't it?
No, that is not what I meant.
I asked one favour of you, Buffy.
To look after your sister.
And now you wanna unload her, so you and Riley can go out.
To patrol.
I'm working.
It's not like I wanna go to the sock hop.
I have to be at the pre-show reception in half an hour.
Who's gonna watch Dawn?
- I don't need anyone to watch me!
- Yes, you do.
Wait.
So whatyou're saying is if I can get an acceptable baby-sitter, I can go patrol?
Baby-sitter?
I'm 14!
I'm old enough to be a baby-sitter.
And who are you gonna get on such short notice?
I can take care of myself.
- Xander.
- Xander?
OK.
- Dawn patrol.
- Hey.
Checkthis out.
They put cheese on round bread.
It's gonna be big.
Xander is so much cuter than anyone.
And smarter, too.
He totally skipped college and got a job working construction, which is so kind of deep, you know.
He builds things.
And he's brave, too.
Just last week he went undercover to stop that Dracula guy.
- Have fun.
Not too much fun, though.
- Dawn.
- Dawn, be good.
- We will.
We're just gonna play with matches, run with scissors, take candy from some guy - I don't know his name.
Xander treats everyone like an equal.
He doesn't look down on people.
- Hello there, little girl.
- Even when he should.
We are gonna have fun, fun, fun!
Look, I've got Monopoly, Clue and ooh, The Game of Life!
That sounds good!
Poor Dawn.
She was pretty shaken up.
Well, sure.
Bloody death and stuff.
She'll be OK.
It's just I think it's tough for her.
Not being able to allowed to, you know, help.
- Help?
- Out.
You.
You guys.
The Slayer Circle.
Well, Buffy doesn't really need and I think Dawn's a little young.
I know.
You're right.
It's just hard.
That outsider feeling.
Tara, you're not an outsider.
Well, yeah, I kinda am.
No.
No, you're not.
Willow, it's OK.
Where does this go?
Is somebody making you feel uncomfortable?
- Is it Xander?
It's Xander, isn't it?
- Xander's a sweetie.
It's Giles!
It's cos he's British and doesn't understand about stuff.
It's no one.
You guys all just have this really tight bond.
It's hard to break into that.
And I'm not even sure I want to.
I'm sure.
You're completely one of the gang now.
Everyone accepts that.
You're one of the good guys.
Maybe I can talkto the rest of the group and we can do something, some kind of Scooby initiation.
Maybe we can wear some kind of special ring that identifies us as members.
I don't think so.
But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn.
- I do worry about her sometimes.
- You don't have to.
She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her.
So then my mom goes off on me about how I'm supposed to watch out for Dawn and shield her from stuff that might upset her.
- Like dead shopkeepers.
- She didn't see him.
A foot, maybe.
A dead foot, which is bad, OK.
But hello!
I see dead stuff all the time and you don't see Mom shielding me.
So, you wantyour mother to give you space to be a slayer and shield you from it at the same time?
Thank you, Logic Boy.
Did I mention, this is a rant?
Sense really has no place in it.
I'm getting that.
What's the deal, Buffy?
You seem really Trash can.
From a distance it looked kinda tense.
No, I was gonna say brown, squat, shadowy.
Uh-huh.
Backto what I was saying before we were rudely attacked by nothing.
You seem really tense.
Yeah, there's a new vampire gang in town.
I mean domestically tense.
You're on Dawn's case a lot.
I guess.
It's just I don't know I know it's always been this way.
She's the baby.
But for some reason, lately, it's just really getting to me.
She's always around.
- Well, yeah.
You're, like, her idol, Buffy.
- Her idol?
I don't think so, unless you like to spill things on your idol's new leather pants and You know what I mean.
You have superpowers and college, a studly yet sensitive boyfriend And a pesky life-or-death job that I can't quit or even take a break from.
She doesn't get the sacrifices.
She's a kid.
And that's what bugs.
She gets to be a kid and she acts like it's the biggest burden in the world.
Sometimes I would like to curl up in Mom's lap and not worry about the fate of the world.
I'd like to be the one who's protected, who's waited on hand and foot, getting her own way.
Always the favourite.
You nut.
Your mom loves you both equally.
But if I'm wrong, I find money usually helps tip the scale.
Slip Joyce a 10 or a 20 once in a while.
Then we'll see who's the favourite.
- He says I'm like a kid sister.
- Here come the judge!
But sometimes when he looks at me, lfeel like he sees me as I am.
As a woman.
Crap!
Look at this!
Now I'm burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children, and more cash than I can reasonably manage.
That means you're winning.
- Really?
- Yes.
Cash equals good.
I'm so pleased.
Can I trade in the children for more cash?
"Slayer, come out and die".
I'm waiting for you, Buffy.
I know you're in there.
What do you mean, she's not in there?
She has to be.
I'm calling her out!
Then I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call.
You and your buddies'll have to be killed by Buffy later.
They're not my buddies.
They're my minions.
- They're what, now?
- Minions.
You know, lackeys?
They work for me.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
What could be funny?
Just "Look out!
It's the terrifying Harmony gang".
Stop laughing!
I just can't picture anyone pathetic enough to be following Is that Brad Konig?
Who'd have thought when you beat up kids in gym class, you'd end up Harmony's lapdog?
Screw you, Harris.
You should know all about being somebody's lapdog.
I hear you were a good puppy for Dracula.
- You heard wrong.
- Don't feel bad.
I hear that mind-control thing he does works really well on weak fraidy-cat losers.
- You didn't stand a chance.
- Shut up!
Dawn, I'm handling this.
- Shut up, Harmony.
- Make me.
I don't feel like another hair-pulling contest with you.
You're the hair-puller, you big girl!
Come inside and say that.
Xander'll kick your Dawn, no!
The invitation was for one.
Not such a pushover any more, am I?
The Slayer's house should have more weapons.
I've been working out, learning some newtricks, honing my instincts.
This isn't over, Xander!
I'll be back!
And we'll be ready for ya!
Stakes, crosses, the whole enchilada.
Buffy is not gonna be happy about this.
Harmony.
Harmony has minions?
Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just Harmony has minions.
And Ruffles have ridges.
Buffy, there's actually a more serious side to all this.
I sure hope so, cos I'm having trouble breathing.
- What is it?
- Well, she did come here to kill you.
Buffy, come on.
They have killed once that we know of.
She could be a threat to you.
Especially nowthat she can enter your house any time she wants.
What?
Yeah, actually, she - Harmony - kind of happened to sorta get an invite.
You guys can't invite her in.
Only someone who lives here can Where is she?
In her room.
Look, I think she's still pretty freaked out.
- Dawn!
- It was an accident.
She didn't mean it.
Well, that just makes it OK then, doesn't it?
No, but believe me, nobody feels worse than her right now.
What a total disaster.
My first plan.
I so wanted it to go well.
Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris.
That was so embarrassing.
- We'll go back later.
- No.
It's no good.
Buffy's gonna expect us now.
The whole surprise is blown.
- Who are you growling at?
- Not me, my stomach.
- If I don't eat somebody, I'll get dizzy.
- Let's go to the lair.
- That census taker may not be empty yet.
- Not me.
This night is young and I want some action.
Happy to oblige.
I thought it was gonna be a slow night.
Step on up, kiddies.
Thrashings for all.
Stop!
Well Hello, Harm.
Spikey.
I mean, Spike.
Long time.
You look good.
- I feel good.
- I remember.
- How have you been?
- Not bad.
Just got a brand-newtelly in my crypt, so - Why are you talking to him?
- It's OK.
We used to go steady.
- Spike, Mort.
Mort, this is - I know who he is.
He kills our kind.
Oh, yeah.
What's up with that?
Bloke's gotta have a hobby, don't he?
Piss off, Mort.
Mort, just give us a couple of minutes, OK?
He's really testy.
Some of us are thinking of voting him out of the gang.
- Gang?
- Oh, yeah.
I've got my own gang now.
- Is that what those circus freaks are?
- Uh-huh.
I mean shut up.
- We're gonna kill the Slayer.
- Singing my song now, are you?
You should pay me royalties for that one, or at least getyour own tune.
I'm not gonna make the mistakes you did.
I've been doing my homework, reading books.
What, Evilfor Dummies?
Look atyou, all puffed up and mighty, thinking you're the new Big Bad.
It's Well, let's face it, it's adorable.
You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now.
There comes a time in a woman's life when she realises she needs to take the next step.
I've taken it.
I've found the real me and I like her.
Hope you'll be very happy together.
In the meantime, save slayer-slaying for the professionals.
You'll see.
Buffy'll be dead by sunrise.
I've got a plan.
Let me guess.
Snatch one of her friends, use 'em as bait, lead her into a trap.
That sort of thing?
No.
Much, much better one.
I'm not gonna tell you!
Thought as much.
Best of luck.
Let me know howthis archvillain thing works out for you.
I'll do that.
And after Buffy is gone, I'm gonna kill everybody in this town that was ever mean to me.
Spike!
Guys!
New plan.
A lot of weapons for somebody you weren't sweating.
That was before Dawn gave Harmony a pass to kill us all in our sleep.
Buff, Willow'll come do a return engagement of her uninvitation spell.
She still has the stuff from last week.
You're back in the Fortress of Solitude.
- All better.
- No.
Not all better.
It's not like Dawn hasn't grown up in this house knowing all the rules.
Especially the biggie!
Numero one-o.
"Do not invite bloodsucking dead people into our home".
I mean, please.
I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive.
People slip, Buffy.
Your mom did.
She invited in the mas Dracula in for coffee.
Well, that was different.
I mean, she He would She was lonely and she didn't know he was a vampire.
The vampire.
Dawn knew exactly what Harmony was when she rolled out the welcome mat for her.
- She's just a kid.
- Will everybody please stop saying that?
I was just a kid when I met my first vampire, but I still managed to remember the rules.
You had to.
It was your job.
No.
No, it was common sense.
But nobody expects even that much from Dawn, do they?
No.
She has to be protected and coddled from the big bad world.
We are doing nothing but turning her into a little idiot who is going to get us all killed.
She just has to be more careful.
Now, I can't be there to protect her 24 hours a day.
I just can't.
Hey!
Don't!
Dawn!
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.
I will after you come back inside the house.
- Let go of me!
- No, it's not safe out here.
You got that right.
Anya!
Vampires took This head wound looks bad.
We better get her to a hospital.
- They took her - Easy.
Sh, sh.
Dawn.
Dawn?
What about Dawn?
She ran out.
They took her.
Vampires.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Take care of Anya.
Buffy!
All right.
Once again, nice work, minionators.
I'm really, really proud of you guys.
Ah, Mort.
I trustyou made our guest comfortable?
You told me to chain her to a wall.
Yeah, I know.
I'm being, you know, sarcastic or whatever.
Anyway, I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people.
I think it's a winner.
- When do we eat the girl?
- We don't.
Notyet.
- Why not?
- Because that's not the plan.
Do I have to go over the plan again?
We use the sister as bait.
We send Buffy a note More notes?
We send Buffy a note, telling her that if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come alone to a place we choose.
She comes, we jump her, we kill her.
So it doesn't matter if we're actually holding the Slayer's sister.
Just as long as she thinks we are, she'll walk into the trap.
I guess.
So we can eat the girl now.
- We're not eating the girl.
- Why not?
Because that's not the plan.
Bollocks.
Gonna have to pinch one of those satellite dishes.
Well, speaking of dishes, to what do I owe this unpleasant sur Bloody hell!
I don't have time for banter.
Where's Harmony's lair?
Haven't seen her in months.
How should I know?
- Where is she?
- At least lay off the nose.
OK, OK!
Used to have a cave in the north woods.
About 40 metres past the overpass construction site.
I was telling you the truth!
I know.
They don't respect me.
They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing.
I mean, I'm the one who put this group together.
Me!
But they treat me like I don't even matter.
Do you have any idea what that feels like?
A little.
They have no idea how much pressure I'm under.
I have to make all the hard decisions.
And it's hard!
Excuse me.
I didn't hear anybody knock.
We've been talking it over and we decided we don't like this plan.
Except for Brad.
He abstained.
Oh, really?
You have a plan you like better?
We're gonna feed on the girl and kill you.
Maybe not in that order.
I don't think I like your attitude, Mort.
Kill him for me.
All right.
You're all on my list.
This isn't fair.
OK, so things haven't been perfect.
I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role.
Time's up.
Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you.
Can't say she didn't warn him.
- And you didn't like the plan.
- Dawn, close your eyes.
So, Slayer, at last we meet.
We've met, Harmony, you halfwit.
I'm the halfwit?
Excuse me, but look who's fallen into my trap.
Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad.
When you tried to chair the homecoming committee, you were bad.
But when you try to be bad, you suck.
Buffy, watch out!
Good shot, Mort!
I think you got her on the You are going to be in so much trouble when we get home.
Yeah, well, I'm telling Mom you slayed in front of me.
Fine.
I'll tell her you ran out of the house in the middle of the night, thatyou gotAnya hurt, invited a vampire in, got kidnapped Sorry it ran so late.
Everything go OK?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know.
I got the vamps and we watched some TV.
Well, I know at least one of us who's supposed to be in bed by now.
Good night.
- So how was the exhibit?
- It was fantastic.
Buffy probably would've gotten in way more trouble than me anyway.
But I guess it was pretty OK of her not to say anything to Mom.
Anya's gonna be OK and Xander wasn't mad at me.
So stuff mostly worked out.
- Giles, are you sure about this?
- Why wouldn't I be?
Most magic-shop owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer.
- And have you ever run a store before?
- I was a librarian for years.
This is the same, except people pay for the things they never return.
It'll give me focus, help increase my resources.
And it'll preventyou lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours.
There may even be space for you to train in the back.
Boy, you've really thought this through.
How bored were you lastyear?
I watched Passions with Spike.
Let us never speak of it.
Don't break anything.
Just don't touch anything.
Not that Buffy's really changed at all.
Like she ever would.
Whatyou're doing right now, not moving?
Good.
Keep doing that.
She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody, just her dumb little sister.
Boy, is she in for a surprise!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Nobody knows who I am.
Not the real me.
No one understands.
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
I know it's always been this way.
She's the baby.
But, for some reason, lately it's just really getting to me.
Well, yeah.
You're her idol, Buffy.
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.
I will after you come back inside the house.
- Let go of me.
- No, it's not safe out here.
Anya.
This head wound looks bad.
We better get her to a hospital.
I wish I had some food to offer you guys, but the hotplate's out of commission.
We thinkthe cat peed on it.
I do have SpaghettiOs.
Set 'em on the dryer and you're a cycle from lukewarm goodness.
I had dryer food for lunch.
Guess the folks are back.
No, no, I was wrong.
Just incompetent burglars.
Yeah, it's definitely time to look for a new place.
Something a little nicer.
Buffy, you've been to Hell.
They have one-bedrooms, right?
Buffy, how's that book?
Full of zippy dates and zesty names?
I'm fine.
I'm enjoying the studying.
Who are you lately?
Give it up and watch the movie.
It has been a long day with the Crusades.
I could take a break from the violence for some fighting.
If you really want, we can fightyou as well.
Incompetently-dubbed kung fu.
Our most valuable Chinese import.
Much more durable than their hotplates.
Here.
Just relax.
That feels good.
What are you doing?
I have a dislocated shoulder.
I'm trying to concentrate on the kicking movie.
Rubbing went away.
Sorry.
I got caught up in the action.
Yeah.
It was pretty good.
Give me a break.
This is wrong.
Firstyou'd give the big guy a flying kick.
Then you would take out all the little ones.
See?
Now with the flying kick.
From a dead stop.
What's powering it - raw enthusiasm?
Buff, you oughta leave the work behind sometimes.
You're not always on slayer duty.
It would drive you crazy if this were an army movie and they were all saluting backwards and invading all willy-nilly.
And anyway, you can't blame me for being critical.
Willow's the same way when we watch a movie about witches, right, Xander?
Yeah.
She's all like "What's that, a cauldron?
Who uses a cauldron any more"?
The last step in thy forging is my pain.
The price with which I purchase the death of the Slayer.
If you get the apartment, we'll walk down this hall and say "I'm on my way to Xander's".
- Xander, I probably won't be doing that.
- Really?
I will.
We're just looking.
Rent's high so don't getyour hopes carbonated.
- Butyou have references.
- No, I have Albert, which is me doing an important voice.
Xander Harris?
An excellent tenant.
And a very nice-looking fellow.
Big.
It's nice.
And not subterranean.
It's very above-terranean.
I want it.
Pay anything.
Xander Harris?
No, Riley Finn.
This is Xander.
Hey.
- I brought my friends.
- I see.
- They wouldn't always be around.
- But we're clean and quiet.
We can have the Scooby meetings here.
Giles can explain the boring things over there.
There's a microwave.
It would be like having hot and cold running popcorn.
Phone and electricity are hooked up.
There's a private balcony, ceiling fan, closet space.
And that's the bedroom.
Guys, you can't save it for the bedroom?
OK, good point.
- I brought an application for you to fill out.
- An application?
I can't just tell you my references?
Because there's Albert.
We run your credit check based on the application.
Credit check.
Little check on the credit.
See how credible my cheques are.
And we'll be asking for first, last, security and a small cleaning deposit.
The total's at the bottom of the sheet there.
He'll take it.
Xander, go get the furniture.
I'll wait here.
He's living in his drunken parents' basement where something urinated on the hotplate.
Can we talk quietly over there?
Excuse us.
We like the ceiling fan.
Yes.
It's very, you know, kind of Old South.
Without the unpleasant slavery associations.
But why can't we have it?
I told you.
My construction job is ending and I won't have any more money coming in.
And by the way, you do have your own place.
So when I visityou, I have to be in that awful basement?
Not for ever.
Just until things come together.
Which is when, Xander?
Cos right now, things look pretty untogether.
- You can't expect me to wait around for - Quiet, please, Anya.
What is this?
What's going on with you?
What's going on with me is my arm hurts and I'm tired and I don't really feel like taking a tour of beautiful things I can't have.
I guess I'll just start on that application.
I think you'll like it.
I've been told I have lovely penmanship.
"Miscellaneous curses".
Brilliant.
I'll be lucky if I don't curse my hands off at the wrist.
The Slayer is not here.
Rabbit's foot - no, wait.
That is a fertility god.
Feeble man, you are not likely to strike You are not the Slayer.
You do not concern me.
Like this, and this That's pretty heavy.
That's Oofdar, Goddess of Childbirth.
She's got some nice heft to her.
- How badly did you hurt him?
- Well, "hurt" Maybe not "hurt".
Well, I'm sure he was startled.
Yes, I'd imagine it gave him rather a turn.
He ran away?
Sort of more turned and swept out majestically, I suppose.
He said I didn't concern him.
So a mythic triumph over a completely indifferent foe.
Well, I'm not dead or unconscious, so I say bravo for me.
Some good demons in this one.
See if your guy's in here.
So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked before it opened.
Who's up for a chorus of the "We Told You So" symphony?
Owning this place does seem kinda dangerous.
- Toth.
- What?
He called you a toth.
It's a British expression.
It means "moron".
No.
Toth is the name of the demon.
Be careful with that.
Ancient demon.
Very strong.
Last survivor of the Tothric clan.
It also says for a demon he's unusually sophisticated.
Sophisticated?
So I should discuss men's fashions with him before I chop his head off?
They're referring to the fact that he does not fight barehanded.
He uses tools, devices.
He's also supposed to be very focused.
Since he mentioned the Slayer, we know what the focus is.
He mentioned Buffy?
Where do we find him and how hard can I kill him?
There's no mention of the types of places he might frequent, but I have an idea.
He had a very specific olfactory presence.
Well, I guess we're off to the ol' factory.
I hate that place.
I'm joking.
I know what it means.
He smelled.
Right?
Some demon rituals involve anointing with oils.
Was it sort of sandalwoody?
Not even remotely.
But he was very distinctive.
The city dump.
Where smells go to relax and be themselves.
People say they're recycling.
They're not recycling.
I found a spell so you can't smell anything, but it does it by taking your nose off, so no.
What are you doing here, Spike?
There's a nice lady vampire who set up a charming tearoom over the next pile of crap.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm scavenging.
Very pretty.
Spike, we're looking for a demon.
Tall, robed, skin sort of hanging off, deep voice.
You mean a great tall robey thing like that one?
- Take cover.
- Big guy.
Kick her ass.
Very nice.
I was on your side.
Watch out.
Are you OK?
Buffy, he's gone.
- I'm fine.
- Easy.
He disappeared.
- That had to hurt.
- Yeah.
Take it slowly.
Anya, you trying to use the hotplate again?
Anya?
An?
Oh, my God.
What?
No way.
Who is me?
What am I doin' in there?
Buffy.
Need Buffy.
No, it ate my quarter.
But see, I'm having this aggressively bad day.
I found a quarter.
Well, ma'am, for me it is worth getting excited about.
Come on, Buffy.
Hello?
They hung up.
If this guy wants to fight with weapons, I've got it covered from A to Z. From axe to zee other axe.
Relax.
Another day, another demon.
Right.
It'll be good.
My friend Sharon's brother knows a girl who died choking on her boyfriend's tongue.
- Go away, Dawn.
- I'm not in your room.
I'm in the hallway.
- The hallway doesn't belong to you.
- Get out of here.
Mom, I can stand in the hallway, right?
She's watching us like a big freak.
This must be my "two teenage girls in the house" headache.
It felt familiar.
Good work, Dawn.
You gave her a headache.
I did not.
Did I give you a headache, Mom?
- I'm sure part of it is Buffy's.
- But part of it is Dawn's.
It's so nice you've learned to share.
You girls, sort this out yourselves.
It's good for you.
She didn't say I couldn't stand here.
Very posh.
Oh, Slayer.
One of these days Hey, Harris.
- Harris!
- Harris.
Sorry.
Yeah.
In my trailer, OK?
I'm talking to all the guys.
The job's winding down.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Welcome to payback, Mr Evil Plan Face Stealer.
You take my life, you get my being fired absolutely free.
Harris.
Where's your hard hat?
Sit down.
- How long you worked here, Harris?
- I'm not sure.
- About three months?
- I guess, yeah.
And you haven't done much construction work before this?
I knewthey were gonna notice that.
I have to tell you, that's surprising, cos your work here has been first-rate.
Now, we have another job lined up in Carlton when we finish here.
- You ever think about staying on full time?
- What?
Why isn't he firing me?
Him.
I was thinking that I'd have you head up our interior carpentry crew.
See how it goes.
- It's more responsibility, but the pay's better.
- That'd be great.
A promotion?
But I I mean, he didn't Doesn't he see the shiny thing?
Congratulations, Harris.
You and your girl should go out and celebrate.
I already have an idea how.
I was going to call you, Mr Harris, tell you your credit checked out fine.
But I didn't think you'd be back.
"Mr Harris"?
Yeah, right.
I'm sure you'll like the building.
I think someone said you're currently in your parents' basement?
Right.
There comes a point where you either have to move on or just buy yourself a Klingon costume and go with it.
Well, I hope you'll be happy here, Mr Harris.
- We're certainly happy to have you.
- Thank you.
And if you need anything, day or night, please, call me.
I'm leaving my home number here.
She's coming on to him.
Me.
Call me.
Even for, you know, nonbusiness stuff.
Maybe we could do something?
Please, lady.
That is so not me.
He's too clean, for one thing.
And his socks are all matchy, and Remember, any time.
Anya, you there?
Look, I know you're still mad.
I figure you're pretending you're not home but listening anyway.
Am not.
I have something to show you.
Meet me at the apartment.
You knowthe one.
Nine o'clock.
- I won't letyou do this.
- What's going on out there?
You can't do this to me.
Man, I need Buffy.
No, he looked exactly like me.
It stole my face.
We have to find it and we have to kill it.
She sees it's not me.
Please, Buffy, resist his spell.
Do this for me.
Don't worry, Xander.
Whatever stole your face, it has to deal with the Slayer now.
Don't be scared, Will.
Just listen.
It's me - Xander.
And I can prove it.
OK.
Let's see.
Stuff only you and me know.
OK.
On my seventh birthday, I wanted a toy fire truck and I didn't get it, and you were real nice about it.
Then next door burnt down and real fire trucks came.
I thoughtyou set the fire for me.
And if you did, you can tell me.
Lastyear, I thought I was lactose-intolerant, but it was just some bad Brie.
Every Christmas we watch Charlie Brown together and I do the Snoopy dance.
Xander, stop dancing.
- You called me Xander.
- Xander, shut up.
Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?
What's goin' on?
OK.
I woke up in the dump this morning.
Xander, the basement isn't a dump.
It's more like a really nice hovel.
No.
The dump.
The city dump.
I got hit last night, fell down Woke up this morning.
No.
We walked you home last night, remember?
You walked?
Will, did I do anything weird?
Did I wave any shiny things around?
Shiny things?
What are you talking about?
Last night, that wasn't me.
There's a double out there.
Some "thing" has stolen my face, and it's going around pretending to be me and it's hypnotising people.
It even got to Buffy, Giles and Riley.
It's over there right now and they have no idea.
What intrigues me is there are many demons with the ability to mimic a simple form, but this sounds like more than that.
Hold up.
Do we really have to figure out what it is?
Let's just go kill it.
Yeah.
When the impostor's killed, the body'll probably turn back into whatever it really is.
Toth.
The demon with the creepy stickthing.
- Toth.
- It's gotta be.
He hit Xander with that blast and it allowed him to take Xander's form.
- It could be what the creepy stickthing did.
- Yes, I suppose.
Yes, it makes sense.
A shape-shifting device.
It does make sense.
It must be Toth.
It's a robot.
An evil robot constructed from evil parts that look like me designed to do evil.
Yes.
Or it's Toth.
Or it's Toth.
I was gonna look for Toth anyway.
Guess now I start looking for you.
Should I go with you?
I told Anya to meet me at my new place.
I'd feel a whole lot better knowing she's safe from this creep.
Go be with her.
If you were out there looking for the double too Let's just say that I wouldn't wanna run into you and kill the wrong one.
Good thinking.
When you kill it, make sure you got the one who's actually A demon.
A demon has taken my life from me and he's living it better than I do.
Well, we're working on it.
There has to be a way to get to Buffy to unhypnotise her.
I'll find a spell to snap her out of it.
Right.
Whatever.
Xander, you sound a little You have to help me figure this out, you know.
But I never help.
I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.
That's not true.
Sometimes we all help to save you.
And sometimes you're not in trouble.
I'm just another great humiliation.
And this time it's even worse.
This demon is taking my life and everyone's treating him Everyone's treating him like a grown-up.
Will, I'm starting to feel like - Like what?
- Like he's doing everything better.
He's smarter and I don't know, maybe I should just let him have it.
- Take my life, please.
- Xander, no.
You're just tired, and all soggy.
That's why it seems so hard.
Butyou can't let him just take your whole existence.
Why not?
It's not like I was doing anything so great with it.
When I get to the Pearly Gates, they won't go: "Hey, what a kick-ass comic-book collection.
Come on in".
What have I got that's even worth - Anya.
- You think he's after her?
She won't know.
He can just No way.
He can take anything, but he can't have her.
I need her.
- Really?
- He could be with her right now.
Figure out a spell.
Something reveal-y.
I gotta find her.
Xander, you already knew he was taking over your life and you didn't think aboutAnya till just now?
Wait till you have an evil twin.
See how you handle it.
I handled it fine.
Anya?
An?
Meet me at the apartment.
You know the one.
Nine o'clock.
It's gotta be here.
Where is it?
You're lying.
It's a trick.
No.
Trust me.
- You really got this apartment?
- I really did.
And do you know why?
The ceiling fans?
They're very attractive.
No.
It's because I knew you wanted it.
It's all for you.
Anya, you didn't see me today, did you?
I mean, we didn't talk?
What do you mean?
I just got your phone message, that's all.
Good.
So, what happens next?
Well, at some point we take off our clothes.
I mean, what happens next in our lives?
When do we get a car?
- A car?
- And a boat.
No, wait, I don't mean a boat.
I mean a puppy.
Or a child.
I have a list somewhere.
- What are you talking about?
- Just We have to get going.
I don't have time just to let these things happen.
- There's no hurry.
- Yes, there is.
There's a hurry, Xander.
I'm dying.
I may have as few as 50 years left.
Wait a minute.
This is about this.
What about the sling?
You haven't been hurt like this since you became human.
Maybe it's finally hitting you what being human means.
No, that's not it.
Yes, I think it is.
You were gonna live for thousands of years.
And now you're gonna age and die.
- That must be terrifying.
- You don't understand what it's like.
Being suddenly human?
I think I can get what that would be like.
And we can get through it together.
You can't make it any different.
I'm going to get old.
And you can't promise you'll be with me when I'm wrinkly and my teeth are artificial and stuck into my wrinkly mouth with an adhesive.
No, I can't promise that.
But it doesn't sound terrible.
And that's saying something.
I promise you, Anya.
Very soon you won't be thinking about getting older.
- Get away from her.
- Xander.
Xander?
Get out.
You don't belong here.
Anya, it's me.
It's a demon.
He stole my face.
He's trying to trick you.
- Anya, you know I'm me, right?
- No.
What is it?
Make it go away.
So we split up?
Yeah.
You check where he might go to blend in as Xander.
I'll check where Toth might be.
I swear I know I had that locked.
- Buffy, Toth looks like Xander.
- We already know.
We're on our way.
Wait.
How did you know about this?
He came to me.
I mean Xander did.
And he's in terrible shape.
We need to help him.
- He came to us, too.
- No.
We each had a Xander.
I mean, you didn't have a Xander.
You had a demon in a Xander suit.
What makes you so sure thatyours is the right one?
He knew stuff.
He did the Snoopy dance.
- Buffy, it was Xander and he needs us.
- Oh, dear Lord.
Buffy, our Xander, did he seem a little He seemed kind of forceful and confident.
- That's not Xander.
- I said "Oh, dear Lord".
- You always say that.
- Well, it's always important.
Neither Xander is a demon.
- Is one of them a robot?
- What?
No.
The rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina.
It splits one person into half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies.
As near as I can tell, Toth was attempting to split the Slayer into two different entities.
- Two Buffys?
- Yes.
One with all the qualities in Buffy Summers, the other one with those in the Slayer alone.
The strength, the speed, the heritage.
When it hit Xander, I think it separated him into his strongest points and his weakest.
- But which one's the real one?
- They're both Xander.
Neither of them is evil.
There's nothing in them that Xander didn't already possess.
I still don't get the original plan.
Why do it?
The slayer half would be like slayer concentrate - unkillable.
But the two halves can't exist without each other.
Kill the weaker Buffy half, and the slayer half dies.
So the same goes for the Xanders.
We lose one, we lose them both.
He's the demon.
Or possibly a robot.
Look at me.
Look in my eyes.
Can'tyou see it's me?
- I don't know.
- Please, look at him.
Listen to him.
He's all smooth.
You have to know it's me.
Don't worry, Anya.
I'll get rid of this thing.
I'm thinking this is gonna last about 15 seconds.
I'm thinkin' less.
No.
Don't shoot him.
Can't this thing go any faster?
"Ultimate driving machine", my ass.
We're pushing 70.
- Riley, do you wish?
- No.
No?
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
You wanted to know if I wished you got hit by the ferula-gemina, got split in two.
Well, you have been kind of rankly about the whole slayer gig.
Instead of having Slayer Buffy, you could have Buffy Buffy.
I have Buffy Buffy.
Being the Slayer is part of who you are.
You keep thinking I don't get that, but It's just I know how un-fun it can be.
The bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters.
Buffy, if you led a perfectly normal life, you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are.
I gotta have that.
I gotta have it all.
I'm talkin' toes, elbows, the whole bad ice-skating movie obsession, everything.
There's no part of you I'm not in love with.
We better get there soon.
If Xander kills himself, he's dead.
You know what I mean.
Let go.
I have to kill the demon-bot.
Anya, get out of the way.
- Xander.
- It's all right, Buffy.
I have him.
No, Buffy.
I'm me.
Help me.
He's got my gun.
- You own a gun?
- Xander Gun-holding Xander.
Give it to me.
Buffy, which one's real?
- I am.
- No, I am.
Thank you.
- Wild.
- Yeah.
OK, Xanders.
You've been split in two.
Butyou're both Xander.
And you can't kill each other.
Well, you could, but it would be really bad.
- No way.
- He can't be me.
He's all fancy.
- We can prove you're both Xander.
- Yeah.
How?
- There has to be a way.
- What number am I thinking of?
- I don't thinkthat's gonna do it.
- 11demi.
Wrong.
But see?
No.
We're not the same.
We're all different.
You have different properties, butyou're both Xander.
- Different properties?
- What different properties?
You know.
Sense of direction, good night vision, stuff like that.
But he has a thing in his pocket.
A shiny disc that stuns and disorients.
- What disc?
- Cover your eyes.
- This?
- lt'll meltyour brain.
Look.
It's a nickel someone flattened on the railroad track.
I found it on the construction site.
I thought it was cool.
It's not magic.
No, I It is kinda cool.
Washington's still there, but he's all smushy.
And he may be Jefferson.
Isn't anyone gonna tell me why there are two Xanders?
I will on the way to Giles'.
Let's go.
Great.
Rod Boy.
- I will not miss again, Slayer.
- The gun.
Pick up the gun pieces.
I just made a small cleaning deposit.
Sword.
Yeah.
That cleaning deposit's gone.
I was thinkin' the same thing.
Do you suppose we're both Xander?
Look and admire, ladies.
Look, there's a scar there, and there's the same one right there.
And it's all double.
This zit, and this kinda funny dippy thing.
And this weird little hair that grows in the wrong way.
OK.
Back off, ladies.
Psychologically, this is fascinating.
Doesn't it make everyone wanna lockthem in separate rooms and experiment on them?
Just me, then.
So, you Xanders really do have all the same memories?
All the same physical attributes?
We're completely identical.
Yeah, we checked out some stuff in the car on the way over.
Fingerprints.
Maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away.
See, I can take the boys home and we can all have sex together and then you know, just slap 'em backtogether in the morning.
- She's joking.
- No, she's not.
She entirely wants to have sex with us together - which is wrong and and it would be very confusing.
We just need to arrange the candles.
Also, we should continue to pretend we heard none of the disturbing sex talk.
Check.
Candles and pretence.
It's not like it'd be cheating.
They're both Xander.
Hold on a sec.
If you weren't putting a whammy on people with the shiny thing, - how'd you get the promotion?
- Well, I'm good at that stuff.
- I am?
- Yeah.
- And how about that apartment manager?
- How weird was it when she called me "Mr"?
We're ready.
We should do it now.
- What'll we do if it doesn't work?
- Kill us both, Spock.
They're kinda the same now.
Yes, he's clearly a bad influence on himself.
Summon the goddess.
Chant the chant.
Let's do it.
Actually, it's not that hard.
Your natural state is to be together.
Toth's spell is doing all the work of keeping you apart.
I just have to break it.
So, you two stand right here.
Side by side.
We don't wantyou to end up with two fronts, now, do we?
Are you sure you know howto do this?
Here we go.
Brace yourselves.
Let the spell be ended.
You gotta be kidding.
"Let the spell be ended"?
That's not gonna work.
I liked it the other way.
Put 'em back.
Getting nostalgic?
I don't know.
At first it's just a place, and then you start to make memories.
Then you're like: that's where Spike slept, and there, that's where Anya and I drowned the Sepavro demon.
And right there, that's where I got my heart all ripped out.
I really hate this place.
Anya, I see you've joined the not-sling-wearing crowd.
Yes.
I'm feeling better.
And I anticipate many years before my death.
Excepting disease or airbag-failure.
That sounds nice.
Presents?
Not unless you want my collection of Babylon 5 commemorative plates.
Which you cannot have.
I just thought you could help carry a little.
Me?
Buffy has superstrength.
Why don't we load her up like one of those little horses?
Anya.
Please.
Fine.
I'm justyour slave.
How is it that she can always make me feel Suave Xander's left the building?
You two have your friction, but she digs the whole package.
It's obvious.
Still, I do envy you sometimes.
I mean, for the sanity.
Not that I'm still into Buffy.
Not that I ever was.
I'm well aware of how lucky I am.
Lottery lucky.
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
When I'm with her, it's like I'm split in two.
Half of me is just on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her.
The other half is so still and peaceful.
Just perfectly content.
Just knows this is the one.
But she doesn't love me.
Got something else for me to carry?
- You can help me packthis.
- Sure.
Sure.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
But she doesn't love me.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - What have you done to me?
Professor Walsh.
She implanted the behaviour modifiier.
- A chip in my head.
- Actually, the chip is here.
Tied directly into your central nervous system through the thoracic nerve.
What's happening to me?
- Walsh was feeding you drugs.
- Something's crawling inside.
I don't wanna think about the damage our guys could do in withdrawal.
Buffy?
If you're going out, why don'tyou take your sister?
Mom!
Nobody knows who I am.
Not the real me.
No one understands.
No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
- Riley?
- Buffy, what are you doing here?
- My job?
- I thoughtyou were in the north sector.
Watch out!
Never mind.
Why do I even bother to show up?
Spike, what are you doing here?
Same thing as you and your cub scout here, I'll wager.
A spot of violence before bedtime.
What?
I softened him up.
Better keep out of my way, Spike.
I'm not gonna take this much longer.
And do what with my spare time?
Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?
- Would it keep you out of my way?
- She's right.
You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
Oh!
I sawthat.
Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome.
You should take him home, Slayer.
Make him stay there.
I've got knitting needles he can borrow.
Spike, I just saw you taste your own nose blood.
You know what?
I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say.
Go home.
It's blood.
It's what I do.
Hey, hope I didn't get in the way.
Of course not.
I was just startled.
And, you know I don't love the idea of you patrolling alone.
- Not much for bench-warming.
- No, you made the squad.
You threwthat vampire like he was a teeny-weeny little vampire.
Hey, you wanna go again?
I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.
Nah.
Unless you wanna go back and kill Spike for the fun of it?
I will know your blood, Slayer.
I will make your neck my chalice and drink deep.
Ow!
You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French Revolutionaries.
This was the guy who declared the rights of man, and then the next thing you know he's killing Girondins like it's going out of style.
Will, you're missing my point.
I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr, but the death in the tub, the neck wound just a little more fangy than knifey.
- Charlotte Corday wasn't a martyr either - Buffy - What?
- Listen to us.
We're arguing.
We're having a debate about a college lecture.
I have dreamt of this day since forever.
You are turning into quite the student.
- Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
- Your what?
Occipital.
The lobe in the back of your brain.
You know, like, "Should I be watching my back"?
You know, the back of your brain.
Apparently not.
Don't worry, Will, you still wear the smarty-pants in the family.
I don't know.
You've been studying really a lot.
I'm trying.
But they're piling on the reading and Giles fills any free time with training.
- This working hard is hard work.
- Isn't it crazy like that?
I thought it was gonna be like in the movies.
You know - inspirational music, a montage, me sharpening my pencils, me reading, writing, falling asleep on a pile of books, my glasses crooked, cos in my montage I have glasses.
But real life is slow and it's hurting my occipital lobe.
Oh!
Poor Buffy's brain.
I'm heading to training now.
You wanna come with?
I'm in.
Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution.
Hey!
Wasn't that Robespierre the coolest?
- Robespierre?
You're kidding me, right?
- I'm just getting it going.
It seems the plans worked perfectly.
Yeah, blueprints.
Not a bad idea.
That and getting straight "measure twice, cut once".
For the longest time I had it backwards.
Mess-y!
- Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.
- Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool.
Oh!
Who put the monkey head near the Styx water?
Do we want to pick exploded monkey out of our hair?
Trick or treat!
- Come on in.
- Thank you, kind proprietor.
- Hey, you.
- Hey!
Oh, wow, this place looks great.
Oh, I feel like a witch in a magic shop.
Ooh.
Are these real newt eyes?
No, too rich for my blood, I'm afraid.
No, these are salamander eyes.
The cataracts give them their newt-like appearance.
They're equally effective.
It's just a matter of overcoming snobbery.
You gotta set up a blind taste test and prove that generic amphibian eyes are just as good.
I don't know.
If you ask me, the newt name still means something.
- You ready to train?
- You betcha.
- Shall we then?
- We shall then.
I just keep thinking how cool it would be, if we got a real psychic to sit up here and read fortunes and stuff.
- You should do it.
- Not me.
But I'd love to watch and learn.
From someone who's really good.
You're really good.
I'll prove it.
Here, do me.
What do you see?
Willow hand.
Ow!
Riley!
- Just keeping you on your toes.
- Or off them, as it were.
What got into?
Oh, my God.
Look at this place!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- You need a proper space to train, so - I love it.
So, come on, let's test this puppy out.
Think you can take me?
- What's the matter?
Afraid of competition?
- It must have been so much work.
I'm the dummy man.
I mean, I made the dummy.
The thing thatyou hit that doesn't hit back.
- That, I made.
- It's great.
- It's all great.
- Well, you've earned it.
Truly.
Thank you, guys, so much.
You're like my fairy godmother and Santa Claus and Q, all wrapped up into one.
Q from Bond, not Star Trek.
I'm gonna go change.
Oh, Pacey, you blind idiot.
Can'tyou see she doesn't love you?
- Well, well, well.
Lookee here.
- Is it safe?
Has Buffy gotten to you yet?
I saw her patrolling just now with a stake!
She won't give up until she's killed me to death!
- Buffy's looking for you?
- Of course!
That's why I'm on the lam.
Didn'tyou hear?
I'm totally her arch-nemesis!
Is that right?
I must have missed the memo.
There was a mem?
Spike, oh my God!
This is, like, a real emergency!
I need a hideout so bad.
You're my only hope.
We're just gonna have to rise above our petty differences Listen, Spike I'm desperate.
Desperate, are you?
Come on, Spike.
Pretty please?
I'll do anything!
Anything?
Will you?
Yeah!
I said I'll do anything.
You mean will I have sex with you?
Well, yeah.
Taking up smoking, are you?
I am a villain, Spike.
Hello-o!
I guess you are at that.
What with the Slayer on your tail and all.
She's not the type to give up, either.
She'll huntyou down, day and night, till you're too tired and too hungry to run any more.
And then Then that is you.
I guess you're gonna have to kill her.
I tried!
It was all hard and stuff!
- You do it.
- I'd love to.
But I can't.
Remember?
I've got this cute government chip in my head.
Right.
Guess it'll have to be me after all.
Can you help with the thinking?
Yeah.
I suppose I could do that.
Mm, that was relaxing.
You wanna relax some more?
Again?
Right away again?
- Maybe you're too tired.
- Hey!
I have the endurance of ten men.
Let's make it women, OK?
Just for the imagery.
Whatever.
You know, it takes a lot to wear me out.
Oh, I love a challenge.
Well, wouldn'tyou?
Every kid tries to make the substitute cry.
- It's like a rite of passage.
- I certainly would not.
Being a substitute is an extremely difficult job.
Besides Honestly, Dawn, how many bowls of cereal are you planning on eating?
These aren't for eating.
I'm trying to get the extra out of the way so I could get this!
Anyway, I want eggs.
You want the cereal prize, but not the cereal.
You are growing up.
All righty.
Half an omelette coming up.
Oh, with ketchup, if you please?
What is the?
Who are you?
Hey.
How's Mom?
Are you OK?
- I'm OK.
- And your mom's doing just fine.
- This is Ben.
He gave me his stethoscope.
- Lentyou his stethoscope.
Buffy, right?
I'm Ben.
I'm an intern here.
I'm hanging out with the renowned Dr Dawn while your mom's being tested.
So what's going on?
What happened?
She's doing OK.
The doctors don't know why she collapsed.
It could've been a dizzy spell, low blood sugar - But it's nothing bad.
It's not serious, right?
- Very unlikely.
- She doesn't have a history of fainting?
- No, not that I know of.
It doesn't looktoo serious.
Thank God.
I was freaking out.
I know I'm repeating myself here, but I don't know how else to convince you.
I have never let a patient with tachycardia this severe leave a hospital.
- You said you couldn't keep me.
- Legally, no.
I can't force you.
But with that pulse I'd get on my knees and beg, if I thought I could change your mind.
- You can't.
I'm going home.
- And your friend can't convince you to I'm going.
All right then, butyou're leaving against my recommendation.
What's going on?
What are you doing?
- What if you have a heart attack?
- Listen.
Calm down.
Me calm down?
I'm not the one with a pulse of 150.
My heart's different than yours.
It works differently now, but it's OK.
You're still a human.
You could still have a heart attack.
I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months.
- Hi.
- Hey.
How are you?
Oh, embarrassed, mostly.
I'm sorry to putyou through this.
But no more tests, so you can take this pincushion home.
Yes.
Let's get outta here.
What about a crossword?
Some people say feed a cold.
I say puzzle it.
No, thanks, Willow.
I like chicken fingers with mustard when I'm sick.
I know you do.
I can make us some later.
Uh-uh.
You are sitting right here on this couch today.
I feel silly lying here like a lump.
You could make a game out of it.
A very quiet game, about being a lump.
I feel fine.
Honestly, I'm more concerned about Riley than I am about me.
You shouldn't even be thinking about that.
He's not worried, so we shouldn't be.
I don't get what he's thinking.
Why isn't he worried?
Maybe he thinks his body can handle it.
He is in really good shape.
Nobody's body can handle a heart attack.
I know.
I'm sorry, Buffy.
I'm trying too hard to make it OK.
I just keep coming backto the Initiative.
It does have that icky government feel to it.
Did you knowthat the CIA tried to kill Fidel Castro with a poisonous aspirin?
Dawn, please.
I know I have to do something.
I just don't know what.
- Another time the CIA - Dawn!
It's important.
tried to make Castro go crazy by putting itching powder in his beard.
It's about the government!
Call the Initiative.
If they know what's wrong, they have to help.
Yeah, but call how?
First of all, they don't exist any more, and, secondly, they never claimedto exist in the first place.
It's so unfair.
It's like Big Brother can spy on you all the time, and the second I have something to say no one will listen.
- Sounds more like Big Sister.
- There has to be a way.
Like what?
Take a tour of the White House and pretend to get lost, and look for a door with a sign that says "Secret Government Monster Hunters"?
If they're really spying all the time, say something so they'll hear you.
Like, sometimes, I write fake things in my diary in case I gotta go.
See you guys later.
What'd I say?
Riley?
Riley's in trouble.
He needs help.
Oh, you're kidding!
No way, man!
I'm out.
- Graham.
- Riley.
Can we talk?
Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.
- So talk.
- What's going on, man?
We gotta get this taken care of.
We gotta getyou into an operating room.
Very convincing.
Makes me completely wanna put myself under government control.
Take me to where they can make me unconscious and naked.
- You think I'd pull something on you?
- I don't know what orders you're following.
You know Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us.
You got more than anyone.
She messed us up bad.
And nowthe government wants to kiss it and make it better.
Riley, I'm telling you, you need help.
I'm not saying it to trick you.
- Maybe you even believe it.
- I know it.
You don't want this.
- You're sure you got the fix for it?
- Yeah.
We got a guy.
A doctor.
He's gonna take care of you, and we're going to him now.
I'm not giving you a choice.
I guess you're not.
So you messed up and now he's gone.
What's wrong with him?
- I'm not permitted to say.
- Say.
Hyperadrenal overload and stuff that sounds worse.
He's way stronger than he oughta be and feeling no pain.
His heart can't take it.
We've been at him for weeks about it.
There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, Neurology.
- Get Riley there.
If you don't - I'll get him there.
I'll tell the doc.
And Buffy?
If you tell me to hurry, I'll kick your ass.
- Poor Riley.
- Could he have gone backto his apartment?
No, he's not at his apartment, he's not at the gym or the library.
- He's gone somewhere he can't be found.
- Basically, he's gone AWOL.
Basically exactly.
- Poor Buffy.
- Maybe he just needs some time alone.
I had this friend once who really liked this girl, and he got all worried that she didn't like him back, and maybe that made him act like a total jerk.
Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend.
What are you talking about?
Then again, maybe he just wants attention.
Here's a hot tip, if you want attention.
Be there so people can give it to you.
I care aboutyou, Xander.
- Thanks.
- Don't be insecure.
Thanks.
I won't.
Cos I also have this "friend", and I have it on really good authority that she really likes that guy, your "friend".
And, by the by, my friend You guys, enough!
OK, Riley is in real danger here.
Anya, Xander, why don'tyou checkthe docks.
Aye aye.
Tara and I can scope out the burned-out school.
Riley hid there once.
Maybe he feels it's homey or something.
Homey.
You know what else he might find homey in a dank, unpleasant, evil sort of way?
The Initiative caves.
But I don't knowthem too well.
I had an associate who knows those caves like the back of his melanin-deprived hand.
I so don't wanna deal with Spike right now.
He's really starting to bug me, in that "I wanna shove something wooden through his heart" way.
He does seem extra twitchy lately.
Maybe the whole not killing is getting to him.
Plus, hanging out in that mouldy crypt, you just knowhe's doing something nasty.
OK, is it bigger than a breadbox?
No.
Four left.
- So it's smaller than a breadbox.
- No!
Only three!
- Harmony, is it a sodding breadbox?
- Yes!
Oh, my God!
Someone's Blondie Bear's a 20-question genius!
She's found me!
I've got a proposition for you.
Funny.
I've got a proposition for you.
What about knocking?
Seems only fair since we vamps can't enter your flat without Look at those pieces of paper.
Riley's sick with some Initiative thing and he's missing.
Find him.
Bring him to the fourth floor of the hospital.
Their doctors get to him in time, you get the cash.
Oh, dear, is the enormous hall monitor sick?
Tell me, is he gonna die?
He is not the only person that can die.
Hey.
I'm just saying, if it's really that important to you, I think I'll get half now.
So?
What'd she say about me?
- Any word?
- They'll be here any minute.
That's soon enough, right?
I mean, if we bring him in now?
I'll be honest.
I'm not sure it's soon enough if you brought him in yesterday.
Finally.
You gotyourself a new patient, Doc.
Look, you don't understand.
This is a complicated neurological procedure and I've never performed it before.
Little performance anxiety, eh, Doc?
Butterflies in the old belly?
Harm, do us a favour.
Shoot the nasty butterflies for the good doctor.
There you go, Doc.
It's not so complicated.
Just do what those Initiative lab monkeys did, only backwards.
This is a medical school, not a proper operating facility.
And these instruments They look pointy enough.
They'll do.
You're not listening.
That chip is deeply embedded in your cerebral cortex.
- Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
- That's not gonna happen, mate.
See, I have faith in your survival instinct.
Yeah.
You'll have me up and killing before the night's over.
Come on, Doc!
You do me right, nothing bad'll happen to you.
Oops!
String was slippy.
Riley!
This place kinda creeps me out.
You shoulda been here when it was a school.
Riley!
- Darkness.
- Piles of it.
- We should've brought a flashlight.
- Ooh!
I know!
Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness.
A little spell.
Fiat lux!
There, that's better.
Riley!
Come on out!
- How'd you do that?
With the light?
- Oh, you know.
You taught me.
I taughtyou teeny Tinkerbell light.
OK, so I tinkered with the Tinkerbell.
It was easy.
And besides, isn't this better than using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?
Riley?
Riley, answer me.
Please.
Riley?
You know, this doesn't even hurt.
- Your hand is bleeding.
- Don't feel a thing.
This stops now.
I'm taking you to the doctor.
The one from the government?
Like the ones who did this to me in the first place?
He understands what's wrong with you.
He's the only one that can help.
What's wrong with me?
I'm more powerful than ever.
- Most people would kill to feel this way.
- Yeah, and this feeling is going to kill you.
- Your body won't take this kind of stress - I can handle it.
This is my deal, Buffy.
Just back off.
What is this?
What's happening to you?
I go back, let the government get whimsical with my innards.
They could do anything Best-case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal.
Just Just another guy.
And that's not enough for you?
It's not enough for you.
- Why would you say that?
- Come on.
Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
So that's what this is about?
You're going to die, all over some macho pissing contest?
It's not about him.
It's about us.
You're getting stronger every day, more powerful.
I can't touch you.
Every day you're just a little further out of my reach.
You wanna touch me?
I'm right here.
- I'm not the one running away.
- Notyet.
So you have us all figured out?
I'm bailing because you're not in the superclub.
- It's human nature.
- Don't Psych 101 me.
Not now.
Not after everything that Nobody has ever known me the way you do.
Nobody.
I've opened up to you in ways that I've never opened up to God, you're just sitting backthere thinking that none of this means anything to me.
- I never said that.
- It obviously doesn't mean anything to you.
- Do you think so little of me - Buffy.
No!
No.
Do you thinkthat I spent the lastyear with you because you had superpowers?
If that's what I wanted, then I'd be dating Spike.
Riley, I need you.
I need you with me.
And I need you healthy.
But if you wanna throw it all away because you don't trust me, then then I am still gonna make you go to that doctor.
Take me to him.
We have to hurry.
Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy.
I don't know why.
The doctor said we didn't have much time.
I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain.
Yuck!
No contest.
I mean, look at it.
It's so pink and wriggly-looking.
- Can I touch it?
- No!
- Oh, my God, you're awake?
- Local anaesthetic.
Wow, Spikey.
How does it feel?
Like someone's cutting into my brain with a knife, you silly bint.
You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing?
- It means he can't even pick flowers.
- What?
Yes, I can!
Please be quiet.
- Is it supposed to do that?
- Please.
- For God's sake, please be quiet.
- Listen, buster.
I don't see a crossbow in your hands, OK?
Harmony, if your incessant prattling bollockses up this operation, I'm gonna personally yank outyour pink and wriggly tongue.
What are you looking at?
- Uh-oh.
- Graham.
Graham.
- How many fingers I got up?
- 17.
- Hostile 17 and a blonde girl.
- Spike and Harmony, together again.
- Where's Dr Overheiser?
- Spike must have taken him.
What would Spike want with?
The chip.
He's gonna force the doctor to remove the chip from his brain.
- Riley?
- I'm OK.
OK.
We're running out of time.
We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.
OK.
OK, brain surgery.
He's gonna need a medical facility, he's gonna need equipment - It's a big hospital.
- No, he wouldn't do it here.
It's too risky.
We'll split up.
Graham, get on the horn, or the pipe, or whatever you guys get on.
I wantyou to check animal hospitals, doctors' offices Hey, about before Forget it.
Apologise later, if you're not dead.
- You are not going to die.
- Betyou say that to all the boys.
No.
There is one peroxided pest whose number's up.
I'm gonna rip Spike's head off.
I'm gonna Bathe in the Slayer's blood.
I'm gonna dive in it.
Swim in it.
I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.
I see it, Spikey!
I see the chip!
It's nestled like a pretty Easter egg with your brain around it, like that plastic grassy stuff Only this is more of a beige Would you please put out that cigarette?
It's really not allowed.
Oh, yeah?
Says who?
Oh, God, sorry!
Didn't see the sign.
The chip's out.
I didn't think I could do it.
It just It's out.
Yay!
Yay for Spikey!
Right, then.
Stitch me up, Doc.
Got places to go.
And slayers to kill.
Listen to me.
My stomach's growling, I'm so starved.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have me a little snack.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't fill up on the bread.
I'll still have plenty of room for the main course.
Slayer!
Suit up, Harm.
Stay here.
We're gonna need you.
Buffy, I swear I was just thinking of you.
I wanted to tell you the great news.
My head's all clear now.
No more bug-zapper in my noggin.
- Means I get to kill you.
- You get to try.
Oops!
At long last.
Riley!
Riley.
- A penny?
- I told you I couldn't do it.
Oh, God.
Doctor!
Doctor, we need you now!
Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!
Everywhere I turn, she's there!
That nasty little face.
That bouncing shampoo-commercial hair.
That whole sodding holier-than-thou attitude.
She follows me, tracks me down.
I'm her pet project.
Drive Spike round the bend.
Makes every day a fresh bout of torture.
- Spike?
!
- You don't understand.
I can't get rid of her.
She's everywhere.
She's haunting me, Harmony.
This has got to end.
All patched up.
- How's it going in there?
- Good.
Backto normal.
Yep.
And see?
I'm still touchable.
Give me a week or so to heal and I'll take full advantage of that fact.
Are you gonna be OK?
Cos I should really go check on my mom.
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll be fine.
I'll talkto you later.
It's good Buffy found you when she did, cos you were about to detonate big time.
- I've always said she's pretty impressive.
- You know, she really is.
Butyou know you don't belong here.
This town?
You're nothing here.
Hey.
- What are you saying?
- Come on, man.
You know it's true.
There's nothing for you here.
- There's her.
- OK, right, there's her.
And?
You used to have a mission.
Now you're what?
The mission's boyfriend?
The mission's true love?
You belong with us.
I should have known it was you.
Been nearly six hours.
I've been busy cleaning up your mess.
My mess?
I just borrowed the doc.
The mess is yours, Slayer.
Yours and the boy's.
I'm done.
Spike, you're a killer.
And I should've done this years ago.
You know what?
Do it.
Bloody just do it.
- What?
- End my torment.
Seeing you every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around.
Take me out of a world that has you in it.
Kill me!
Spike, I wantyou.
Buffy, I love you.
God, I love you so much.
Oh, God, no!
Please, no.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Hello, you two, come on in.
- Thank you, kind proprietor.
Don't touch anything.
She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody.
Just her sister.
Boy, is she in for a surprise!
Who are you?
You know Walsh pumped chemicals into us?
You got more than anyone.
- I'm taking you to the doctor.
- The one from the government who did this?
All patched up.
How's it going in there?
Good.
Back to normal.
I love you so much.
- I've always wanted to kill the Slayer.
- I've always wanted piano lessons.
Who's surprised we have all this unexpressed rage?
But, honestly, I think I'm expressing mine better.
Tell you what.
You find yourself a good anger-management class, and I'll jam this poky wood stick through your heart.
That sets the world speed record for closure.
Hey.
If you're looking for one of those rave parties, I'm afraid you're late.
- Chased a bunch of kids out last night.
- Oh, right.
Yeah.
Darn.
My fellow ravers will be so disappointed.
It was my turn to bring the Bundt cake.
If it was my call, I'd letyou do whatever.
It's not like anybody's using this place or nothin'.
They just don't pay enough to argue with the boss.
- Already gone.
- Hold it, miss.
Take your, whatever this is, with you.
Thank you.
Glow balls, huh?
I swear, I don't getyour generation.
Now what is that thing?
I'll letyou know as soon as I find out.
- Dawn, touch nothing.
- Who died and made you the Iron Chef?
Mom's sick and I made her a nice non-instant breakfast for once.
I don't need you Oops!
- doing that.
- Morning, guys.
Check out the pamper-Mom platter.
- You two do all this?
- Buffy helped.
I didn't help I'm sure you did.
So neither of you is pregnant, failing, or under indictment?
Just checking.
We knew you were feeling less than great, so The headaches they said would go away came back and brought some friends.
What did the doctor say?
Take four of some pills a day and come back for tests.
- They don't know what's wrong?
- Notyet.
That's unacceptable.
We need a second opinion.
- We need a first opinion first, honey.
- OK.
We'll go now.
Buffy, I know you're concerned, but don't be.
I'm still the mom, which means I get to worry aboutyou two.
Which is a good thing because you're a vampire slayer.
And you, you are my little pumpkin belly.
Mom!
That's, like, my kid name.
- So I can't be retro?
- Did you ever have any names for me?
No, I think you were always just Buffy.
I got some names for ya.
What are you doing hanging around?
Isn't this Giles' big day?
Bigger than big.
It's his grand opening.
So go.
Bring me back a I don't know A flying broomstick or something.
- Those never really work.
- Whatever.
Book club tonight?
You guys have a book club?
OK, I'm gonna go.
I will be back later.
When is your doctor's appointment?
I just wanna know.
Take it easy.
I wantyou to relax, keep your feet up, plenty of Oprah.
Plus you can check my rainforest report.
And there's old board games - Hey.
You said I couldn't come.
- Changed my mind.
I told you you couldn't ditch me.
Mr Giles.
This place is so wow.
- I mean, check out all the magic junk.
- Our new slogan.
- So when's it open?
For customers?
- Since nine this morning.
Dawn.
Go.
Browse.
And "You break it, you bought it".
Heard you the first 60 times.
Still, not to worry.
I have good feelings about this place.
Magic's a small niche market, but well, think about it.
Sunnydale, monsters, supply and demand.
They'll be lining up round the block in no time.
Yeah.
You'll be making money hand over fist.
Which I guess is a good thing.
You all right?
You seem a little distracted.
It's just my mom's still sick and we have no idea what the deal is.
- She is getting medical attention?
- Yeah.
We have a highly trained medical staff working round the clockto tell us diddly.
I'm sorry.
Still, you know, time and patience both great comforts.
Giles, where's your hat and cloak?
Yeah, the hype was out of control.
Willow, you gotta see this.
They have the coolest talis mans.
Talisguys.
Actually, I have a little Scooby-centric deal to deal with first.
I put this before the group.
What the hell is it?
- It appears to be paranormal in origin.
- How can you tell?
Well, it's so shiny.
- I found it on patrol.
- May be more where that came from.
I say we go back out again tonight.
Sure.
- You can't patrol.
Buffy said.
- No, I didn't.
You said it'd be easier if you didn't have to look out for anybody.
- I wasn't talking about Riley.
- Don't worry.
She said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitteny, butyou'd get hurt.
So welcome to the club.
She'll never let me go either.
What?
What?
Giles, you got that danger room set up out back?
- I'm feeling the need for physical rehab.
- Of course, yes.
- If any customers - On it.
Dawn, we're going.
Buffy, wait.
- Go easy on her.
- Why?
I can't help it.
I just have all this involuntary empathy for Dawn.
Cos she's, you know, a big spaz.
She's so annoying now Mom's sick.
She's all over her while I have to be the grown-up.
The two of them are like the Giggle Twins.
Why can't I ever be "little pumpkin belly"?
While I don't feel qualified to address the last part, I can tell you that Dawn's not just the youngest, she's the baby.
Maybe your mom needs that right now.
Dawn doesn't care what my mom You just have no idea how much I wish I were an only child these days.
Oops!
We can't all be born with Chosen One reflexes.
Sh.
Mom?
Mom?
What's wrong?
It's just my head.
- I'm taking you to the doctor.
- No, sweetheart.
I'm fine.
We don't knowthat.
We don't know anything.
We're going.
I just need my prescription.
Please?
Hospital pharmacy open?
Ten minutes.
Hey, it's Buffy, isn't it?
Ben.
But call me man-nurse.
Everybody else does.
I don't belong here.
I have important instructions.
- Fascists!
- Now you're hurting the nice intern.
I need nine cc's of phenobarbital Or not.
Let's strap him.
For your own good, I promise.
Not to be rampantly sexist, butyou've got some serious muscles for a girl.
- I - Radioactive-spider bite?
- How'd you guess?
- I'm a doctor.
Well, almost.
Doesn't even help.
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference!
I've met this guy.
He's a security guard.
- He's not crazy.
- If you say so.
They're coming atyou.
Don't think you're above it, missy.
They come through the family.
They get to your family!
- My family?
What do you mean?
- Get him to Exam One.
Now would be nice.
They come through the family.
Your family.
I'm real sorry about that.
Here.
- For your mom?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- She's not feeling better?
- Notyet.
But she will be.
I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
There you are.
I have been looking all over for you.
Thank you for choosing to shop at the Magic Box.
Please do come again.
Did you see that?
Real live customers.
They came in, I gave them things, they gave me money and then they left.
It's brilliant!
Congratulations.
You're an official capitalist running dog.
But on the orbular front we're batting zeros.
Well, we'll just have to keep trying.
If there's anything you need help with, let me know.
- Your conjuring powder is overpriced.
- Anya I'm nearly out of money.
I've never had to afford things before and it's making me bitter.
The change is palpable.
That stuff doesn't come cheap.
Well, you're getting ripped off.
I could hook you up direct with the troll that sheds it.
Giles, I have an idea what's making my mom sick.
- Have you spoken with her doctors?
- They won't find anything.
It's supernatural.
The night watchman who found this thing, he went crazy overnight.
It won't hurt us.
I had it on me all night.
But this guy, he sawthings.
He said things.
Such as?
They'll come at me through my family.
- Who will?
- I don't know yet.
But whatever touched this guy, it made him see through what the rest of us are seeing.
He knew someone's hurting my mom and they're trying to get to me.
It's possible, but still the ramblings of a madman aren't much to go on.
Yeah, but it's a start.
We need to find out who's making my mom sick, and how.
Then what?
Then I hunt them, find them, and kill them.
When you think about it, I'm the victim here.
First off, I don't even wanna be here.
I'm not talking about this room, city, state or planet.
I'm talking about the mortal coil.
It's disgusting.
The food, the clothes the people.
I could crap a better existence than this.
But Tell me if this next part gets a little too personal, because I have boundary issues.
But I'm hurt.
Yes.
By your incredibly selfish behaviour.
Newsflash, hairdo: it's not always aboutyou.
All I want is the Key.
Why can'tyou tell me where the Key is?
Forgive me monky.
Sometimes I just get so anxious, like there's something deep inside of me and it's swelling up and it's making me crazy, that I forget there's all that duct tape on your face.
Now tell me where the Key is.
Or I'm going bowling.
It's OK, it's OK.
The stutter's sexy.
Keep it coming.
speakAmerican.
I will tell you nothing.
Fine.
You know what I wish?
I wish thatyou could feel what I'm feeling right now.
Whatever you are, whatever you're on, please.
Cos I don't know how much more of this I can take.
I have a wife.
Her name's Jennifer.
We have two daughters.
I bet this is fun for you, isn't it?
Say it.
You like to torture me.
Why?
You don't even own the damn thing and I want it, I need it.
I've gotta have it now and you keep refusing to tell me where the Key is.
And it's typical.
It's typical.
It's typical.
The mortal meat sack comes with stink and bile, sweat and protein.
Yes, I said humans.
Not now, Mommy's talking.
Wriggling, prowling, crawling, cavorting, doing it over and over and over and over until someone's gonna sit down on their tuffet and make this birthing stop!
That is so much better.
- Do you gift-wrap?
- Do we!
Do we?
We do.
A little help.
No, no, no.
Ground cloven hooves are 30%off.
The whole ones are full price.
That's not candy Xander.
There's too many of them.
People.
And they all seem to want things.
I hear ya.
Stay British.
You'll be OK.
The thousand-yard stare.
Damn.
You hate to see that on any man but especially in retail.
Please go.
Anya, the Shopkeepers' Union of America called.
They want me to tell you that "Please go" just got replaced with "Have a nice day".
But I have their money.
Who cares what kind of day they have?
No one.
It's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity.
Embrace it.
Hey, you.
Have a nice day.
There's my girl!
Did you ever think in a million years you'd miss the high-school library?
Someone put a spell on my mom.
Something to make it seem like she's sick.
That's a new kind of nasty.
Any suspects?
Well, I've got the list narrowed down to just under infinity.
Does this look right to you?
Sure.
If you wrapped it with your feet.
Buffy, there used to be this French sorcerer back in the 16th I don't know what name - Cloutier?
- So cute in his little knickers.
But he had this one spell demons just hated called "tirer la couverture".
- "Rotate many foodstuffs"?
- "Pull the curtain back".
A spell to see spells.
A trance to see spells, actually, butyou get the idea.
Try that.
What do you mean, "see" spells?
All spells leave a trace signature.
It's just not perceptible to the human eye.
In this case, it could be the image of a hand choking your mother.
Or a cloud of mist around her.
Or maybe the shape of the demon that's performing the spell?
Possible, yes.
So I'll do what Monsieur Silk Knickers did.
I'll go home, get trancey and see what's affecting my mom.
I don't know, Buffy.
Trances?
Yes, the sorcerer Cloutier was legendary.
His skills at achieving higher states of consciousness were Better than mine?
I knew he'd say that.
But I've been practising concentration.
I'm close.
- Are you ready?
- It's my mom.
I'll get ready.
What do I need?
Thanks for coming over.
I really appreciate the help.
Sure thing.
So what do I do?
Lots.
Tons.
Lots and lots of tons.
- This is all kinda - Newterrain?
All praying, no slaying.
OK, so the incense needs to be ignited.
There's a job.
This stuff needs to get poured around me in a circle.
You need me to light incense and pour sand?
Magic incense and spooky sand.
- The ritual itself is - Something you do alone.
Are you sure this isn't justyour way of trying to make me feel less "cute and weak and kittenish"?
"Kitteny".
Right.
Much manlier.
Look - I really am OK.
- I know.
So I'm not Superguy any more.
It was borrowed power anyway.
Had to give it back sometime.
I know you can handle yourself.
I just didn't wanna see you get hurt.
Maybe instead of you trying to take care of me, we agree to take care of each other.
Deal?
Done.
Good.
For luck.
A girl needs more luckthan that.
Have a nice trip.
- What are you doing?
- My boyfriend.
Go away.
- Liar.
Are you doing magic?
- No, I'm not.
- Can I watch?
- No, you can't.
Come on.
Please, please.
Like, times ten and cubed.
Please!
Yeah, well, I can smell your stinky incense down the hall.
And your clothes are gonna reek.
And if you are doing magic, I am so telling.
Fine.
Go.
Go tell.
Go do whatever you want.
Just go.
Buffy?
Mom.
Are you going out?
Either modern medicine's working or I tookthe world's best placebo.
Either way, I'm going out for a couple of hours.
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Are you sure you're feeling OK?
You seem a little out of it.
Hey, Buffy?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Long day's all.
You go, have a good time.
You're so grown-up.
Buffy?
Buffy.
Buffy, who said you could come in my room?
You're not my sister.
Yeah, like I even wanna be related to your nasty self.
What are you doing?
- What are you?
- Get off me.
- You wanna hurt me?
- Let go, you freak.
- Then you deal with me.
- I'm telling Mom.
You stay away from my mother.
- What?
- Buffy?
I'm glad I've caughtyou.
We may have underestimated what we're dealing with.
Go on.
We've uncovered more than expected about this orb.
It's called the Dagon Sphere and it has a history going back many centuries.
- What's it do?
- It's a protective device.
Used to ward off ancient primordial evil.
- Any word on what this evil looks like?
- Unfortunately, no.
This is where accounts get Excuse me.
This is where accounts get vague.
All we've managed to uncover so far is the Dagon Sphere was created to repel That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named.
I'm gonna go backto the factory.
Whoever planted this doohickey's got answers.
You've heard me say this before, but do be careful.
Anything that goes unnamed is usually an object of deep worship or great fear.
Have you completed the trance?
Seen what's harming your mother?
That's the thing.
I just saw Nothing.
It didn't work.
What are you talking about?
Slayer stuff.
I'm going out.
Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?
What's that supposed to mean?
I'll be home in an hour.
Mom's coming back.
I'll be back first.
Spike.
Hi, Buffy.
Don't take this the wrong way, but What are you doing here?
Five words or less.
Out for a walk.
Bitch.
Out for a walk at night by my house.
No one has time for this, William.
On your merry way, then.
Contrary to one's self-involved world-view, your house happens to be directly between parts and other parts of this town.
I would pass by in the day but I'm outgrowing my whole "burst into flame" phase.
- Fine.
Keep going.
I cutyou a break.
- Yeah, OK.
Let me guess, you won't kill me?
The whole crowd-pleasing threats and swagger routine.
How original.
I'm just passing through.
Satisfied?
I really hope so, cos God knows you need some satisfaction in life besides shagging Captain Cardboard.
And I never really liked you anyway.
And you have stupid hair.
Buffy?
Girls?
Where is everybody?
Hi, Mom.
Dawn.
Where's Buffy?
You don't have to worry about her.
You're probably right.
It's not like she's never patrolled before.
Anyway, I was feeling kind of What's the medical term?
Crappy.
So I called off the big night out.
Want tea, Mom?
I made it for you.
It was you who planted the Dagon Sphere, right?
I got it.
Don't worry.
I'm stronger than I look.
I've had experience with stuff like this before.
Best of all I'm not stupid.
Sure about that last part?
Would someone please rip that bloody bell off its hinges?
Would that involve moving?
My feet are numb.
I'll see your numbness and I'll raise you a lower back pain.
I think I liked it better when demons would just crash in here and tear the place apart.
It just seemed simpler.
You're out of crystal balls.
They're popular with the amateurs.
Better restock and raise the price 10%.
Make it 15.
- Anya - Cash register looks like a squirrel's nest.
- Anya - The Hand of Glory packs serious power.
- Better institute a check for - Anya!
Would you like a job?
OK.
Good.
Then we can talk shop tomorrow.
OK.
Boss.
Hey, any word from Buffy on how her spell went?
She said it didn't work.
Now she's off investigating whoever left the Dagon Sphere behind.
You're not worried about the Slaymaster General, are you?
No, no.
I just hope she isn't doing anything too rash.
And another thing.
I just wantyou to know this "beatyou to death" thing - it's valuable time out of life that I'm never gonna get back.
Wait.
I've always wanted to try that thing with worms where, if you rip it in half, you get two worms.
D'you thinkthat'll work with you?
You hit me.
Are you crazy?
You can't go around hitting people.
Were you born in a barn?
Fine.
Be that way.
I just noticed something.
You have superpowers.
That is so cool.
Can you fly?
Hey.
Hands off my holy man.
Stop.
- Please.
- No.
We have to keep going.
My journey is done, I think.
Don't get metaphory on me.
We're going.
You have to The Key.
You must protect the Key.
Fine.
We can protect the Key together, OK?
Just far, far from here.
Many more die if you don't keep it safe.
How?
What is it?
The Key is energy.
It's a portal.
It opens the door.
The Dagon Sphere?
No.
For centuries it had no form at all.
My brethren its only keepers.
Then the abomination found us.
We had to hide the Key.
Gave it form.
Moulded it flesh.
Made it human and sent it to you.
Dawn.
She is the Key.
You put that in my house?
We knewthe Slayer would protect.
My memories and my mom's?
- We built them.
- Then unbuild them.
This is my life you're You cannot abandon.
I didn't ask for this.
I don't even know What is she?
Human.
Now human and helpless.
Please She is an innocent in this.
She needs you.
She's not my sister.
She doesn't knowthat.
You're home.
I wasn't bothering her.
What was that all about?
Nothing.
Sister stuff.
Go away.
I'm sorry.
- You hurt my arm.
- I know.
Butthole.
Really sorry.
I tell you, I have this theory.
It goes where you're the one who's not my sister.
Cos Mom adopted you from a shoe box full of baby howler monkeys and never told you, cos it could hurtyour delicate baby feelings.
That's your theory?
Explains your fashion sense.
And smell.
I'm sorry, OK?
Broken record much?
You can't even take an apology.
You always do that.
Ever since I just had a bad day.
Join the club.
- Can I be president?
- I'm president.
You could be the janitor.
OK.
- Buffy?
- Yeah?
What's wrong with Mom?
I don't know.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Buffy, I love you.
We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy.
Are you sure we're ready for that?
Or not.
Tell me where the Key is.
The Key is energy.
It's a portal.
- My brethren sent it to you.
- Dawn.
- She's not my sister?
- She doesn't knowthat.
Tell me a story.
OK.
Once upon a time, there was a kitty.
She was very little and she was all alone and nobody wanted her.
- This is a very upsetting story.
- But it gets better.
Cos one day the kitty was running around the street and a man came, and swooped her up, and took her to the pound.
At the pound there were lots of other kitties and there were puppies and some ferrets Were there dolphins?
Yes.
Many dolphins at the pound.
Was there a camel?
There was the front of a camel.
A half-camel.
Did the kitty get chosen by some nice people?
Well, now you ruined the ending.
I'm sleepy.
Do you mind if I keep the light on?
I was gonna look up some spells.
It's fine.
I don't need to be snuggled.
Vixen!
You've been Spell Gal night and day lately.
Well, I just wanna keep up with you and Well, I just like to be useful.
You know, to the gang?
I just never feel useful.
You are.
You're essential.
- Think Buffy found out anything tonight?
- At the factory?
I don't know.
If there was something, I figured she'd call us.
I don't know what to say.
Tell me about it.
She has no idea?
No.
She thinks she's my kid sister.
Are you going to tell her?
How can I?
She'd freak and that's the last thing we need.
We have to keep her safe.
This woman, this whatever she was.
She knows you now.
Should we be thinking about sending Dawn away?
Away where?
I don't know.
Your father's?
Yeah.
He's in Spain, with his secretary.
Living the cliché.
I called him when Mom got sick.
He hasn't even I'm sorry.
When he bailed on us, I remember Dawn cried for a week.
Except she didn't.
She wasn't there, but I can still feel what it was like.
They sent her to me, Giles.
I think I have to take care of her.
I want to.
- Do we tell the others?
- No.
No one.
They'd act weird around her, and it's safer for everyone if they don't know.
Yes.
We have to find out who this woman is and what she needs Dawn for.
- If she comes after you - She'll come.
She'll come for us.
OK.
Now I'm upset.
- Thumb!
Necessary opposable thumb!
- Sorry.
Crybaby.
- You know what, guys?
Just leave it here.
- Got it.
- I don't need help.
- Just be careful.
But we just helped her move the stuff in a few days ago.
And it was fun!
People help each other out, Anya.
It's one of our strange customs.
Giles, you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping.
Well, I saw myself in more of a patriarchal sort of role.
You know.
Lots of pointing and scowling.
- You two, stop that!
- He started it.
He called me a bad name.
I think it was bad.
It might've been Latin.
- Stop it, or you're going to break something.
- Or I'm going to break something.
Can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
Just a few days after we moved you in!
It's no big.
You know, with Mom not being well, I'm hardly ever here.
Just figured I'd save a little cash for this semester.
- I thinkthat's smart.
- Still, it's hard to give up.
Two entrances.
A lot of opportunity for bawdy French farce.
- Everybody loves bawdy - Where's Dawn?
- I think she just walked out.
- Dawn!
- Some of your CDs are my CDs.
- I know.
Come help me fold.
Feeling that fight?
Nothing like getting your ass kicked to make your ass hurt.
- You'll take her next time.
- Cos you'll have backup, baby.
- She's messing with all of us.
- Yes.
We'll find her weaknesses and then Yeah.
You learn her source and we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.
That was funny if you studied Taglarin mythic rites.
- And are a complete dork.
- Then how come Xander didn't laugh?
I don't knowthat Taglarin stuff.
Hey.
You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Stupid.
OK.
Guys, now remember, you have to be at the Bronze by eight.
Bronze.
Tomorrow night!
Tara's birthday!
Right!
Right.
We have to bring presents?
Birth is a present thing?
I got something picked out, yeah.
You guys can all still come, right?
I mean, I knowthere's this new evil and all, but No, no.
We'll be there.
I could definitely use a break from all this craziness.
- What's the story?
- Another crazy.
Got her family out there.
- A guess.
No history of mental problems?
- Yeah.
That makes, like, five this month.
They told me Sunnydale was gonna be interesting.
- Aren'tyou off?
- Yeah, as of now.
Have fun.
I need a favour.
Thank you for coming.
We value your patronage.
Come again for more purchases!
Could we be a little less effusive, Anya?
Don't want to frighten the people.
I'm just so excited.
They come in, I help them.
They give us money in exchange for goods.
You give me money for working for you.
I have a place in the world now.
I'm part of the system.
I'm a working gal!
Yes.
Why don'tyou start organising the shipping orders?
No, that's boring.
I just wanna do the money parts.
Well, sure I forgot about the party.
There's kind of a lot going on.
And it's not, you know, the most thrilling social event of the season.
Yeah.
It's a big deal for Willow, though.
I mean, you are gonna be there?
Yeah.
Barring monsters.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Gimme sugar.
I've come to buy sugar.
We value your patronage.
Any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?
Well, I've narrowed it down some.
Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
Well, you didn't give me much to go on.
She looks human, so the mug shots are no use.
You can't be more specific about what she's like?
She was kinda like Cordelia, actually.
- I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
- That one, of course.
Our work is done.
- There must be something on her.
- The answer is somewhere here.
It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it!
I'm helping.
I'm reading.
I'm quiet.
So, what'd you get her?
Tara.
You said you got a present already.
Yeah, that was a tangled web of lies, sweetie.
I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd - I mean, I don't really know her that well.
- I know.
- I mean, she's nice.
- Yeah!
Yeah, nice.
Nice.
- I just I sort of - I don't necessarily get her, but she's nice.
- Yeah.
There's just that thing.
- That thing.
- That thing of not understanding - Half of what she says?
- As for example.
But she's super nice.
- You betcha.
Thinkthere'll be a lot of Wiccas there?
Heavy Wiccan crowd?
That's sort of her deal.
Her and Willow are all Wiccie.
Swinging with the Wiccan lifestyle.
- Which is cool.
- Oh, yeah.
I just hope we fit in, not awkward.
With Willow, it's like she's got this whole newthing in her life.
But she's still Willow.
I can figure her out.
But Tara, I know she likes Willow.
She already has one of those.
I have a present-buying headache.
Tara's birthday is one too many things to worry about.
Relax.
You should take a few minutes.
Train or stretch out.
Do something to work off the tension.
You want me, Slayer, come and get me.
Oh, I'm coming.
I'm coming right now!
What are you thinking?
All aboutyou, baby.
You're my little lamb.
- Come up with anything yet?
- Candles maybe, or bath oils of some kind.
I saw a really cute sweater at Bloomie's, but I think I want me to have it.
- And you are talking about what on earth?
- Tara's birthday.
We're at a loss.
You're in a magic shop and you can't think what Tara would like.
I believe you're both profoundly stupid.
We don't really know what kind of things witches like.
What, are we gonna get her some cheesy crystal ball?
Bloody well better not.
I've got mine already wrapped.
Are all these magic books?
Private collection.
Books for sale are against the walls over there.
All these books got spells in 'em?
Turn people into frogs, things like that?
Yeah, we're building a race of frog people.
It's a good time.
So, are you all witches or?
Hey, don't do a spell on me now.
Was there something in particular you were looking for?
Her insect reflection.
That is so good.
- That'd be funny, if her centre of power was - Well, what do you know?
What's the matter?
You don't have a hug for your big brother?
Brother?
Willow, this is Donny.
- Hi.
- Nice to meetyou.
And these are my friends.
What, all of you hang out?
Wow.
That's more people than you met in high school.
How did you find I mean, how come you came?
Well, duh, birthday girl.
We came down in the camper, been all over the campus.
"We"?
Look what I found!
Dad, hi.
Well, here's my girl.
- Such a surprise.
- Yes.
- Cousin Beth.
- Hey.
One of your dorm-mates said I might find you here.
These are these are friends.
This is Mr Giles.
He runs the shop.
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.
I don't mean to interruptyour plans.
I know we've come kind of suddenly, - but I thought we could have dinner.
- OK.
Why don't I pick you up at six, and we'll do some catching up?
Yes, sir.
Forgive me for running out.
We're double-parked.
Nice to meetyou all.
That's so weird.
Your whole family.
Yeah.
- They seem nice.
- You know.
They're OK.
- Families are always - They make you crazy.
Usually.
- Wanna get into research mode?
- Sure.
- Honey, I'm home.
- Did you have a good day at work?
It's a rat race.
I squared away your stuff.
Wouldn't even know you left.
You're a god.
You're like the God of Boyfriends.
Nah, I just like it when you owe me favours.
Well, this earns you a big favour.
There could be outfits.
Be still, my heart.
- See ya later.
- Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Where do you think you're going?
- To Melinda's for dinner.
- Since when?
- Now-ish.
- You can't.
It's not safe for you to walkthere.
- It's across the street.
- What's the big deal?
I'm just gonna go - No.
It's family night.
And besides, Melinda's a bad influence.
I don't like you hanging out with someone that short.
I am so glad you're moving back into the house.
This is the source of my gladness.
She makes me crazy.
That's kinda the word I was searching for.
What?
She shouldn't be going over there.
A lot of young people are experimenting with shortness.
Gotta nip that in the bud.
She can't be running out whenever she'd like.
- It's more than that.
- What do you mean?
You tell me.
We all have to be careful.
This demon chick is exciting and new.
- I don't know what I'm up against.
- If we're in trouble, I can contact Graham.
- Maybe get the government boys on it.
- No!
I don't want them anywhere near this.
Just a suggestion.
Look, the fewer people that are involved, the safer I will feel.
Every time I think I'm getting closer to you - I gotta take off.
- Wait!
What?
- I'll call you later.
- Riley.
I wantyou to help.
I'm not Yeah.
I know you got a lot on your mind.
If you decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
I'll come running.
The door wasn't locked.
I was a little early.
I suppose you wanted me to see all these toys.
You don't even try to hide it any more.
I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over the whole witchcraft thing.
That if we letyou go, you'd get it out of your system.
Then they told me to look for you in the that store.
I didn't knowthatyou were coming.
Of course we came.
We haven't heard from you in months.
Your birthday's getting closer.
You know what that means.
I don't think it's - It won't mean that - You're turning 20.
It's the same age your mother was when she Do your friends even know?
Yes.
Are you lying to me?
You're coming home with us.
You know it's the only way.
Home?
You can't control what's going to happen.
You have evil inside of you and it will come out.
Letting yourself work all this magic is only going to make it worse.
Where do you thinkthat power comes from?
It doesn't feel evil, sir.
Evil never does.
I don't feel much like eating right now.
I'll give you some time, but we need to be gone by morning.
Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what.
How do you think your friends are going to feel when they see your true face?
Finally.
I thoughtyou were gonna nap the whole day away.
Stop whining.
I remember when the Lei-Ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for sickly types to suckthe bone marrowfrom.
But let's talk about my problems for 30 seconds, if that's perfectly all right with you.
Blonde.
Short.
Strong for a human, and massively rude.
Broke my shoe, took my monk.
Any idea who I'm talking about?
A slayer?
Oh, God, please don't tell me I was fighting a vampire slayer!
How unbelievably common!
If I had friends and they heard about this And you know she's going around telling everybody.
She's probably just Pay attention!
I am great and I am beautiful, and when I walk into a room all eyes turn to me, because my name is a holy name and you will listen!
Getyour friends.
Find the girl.
Kill the girl.
OK, baby?
You have the cutest little suppurating sores!
Has anyone ever told you that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Was dinner fun?
Well, there's Scoobyage afoot.
Giles called a meeting about our spanking new menace.
You should go.
They don't need me for that.
You can fill me in.
No.
No, you have to come.
This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful and I was thinking, maybe we can try that spell.
- You know, the one to find demons?
- That didn't work.
Yeah, but we only tried it once and I think I got some ingredients wrong.
Well, I'm tired.
We can do it tomorrow?
- You sure you don't wanna - Look, my family's here, OK?
I can't just Not everything is about your friends and stuff.
Sorry.
No!
No, I mean There's just so much going on.
I just I'm really tired.
OK.
I'll see you in the morning.
You can fill me in.
Great.
We'll be demon hunters.
- Am I late?
Did I miss any exposition?
- No, I've nothing earth-shattering to relate.
I've had a fewthoughts and wanted to make sure that we were on the same page.
- Can I buy one of these?
- No.
- With my own money?
- I letyou come.
Now sit down and look studious.
Well, first of all, I want to talkto you about safety.
- This creature could be - Will be.
Will be coming after Buffy and possibly all of us Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all.
Your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.
Now, I may have a lead on this monkthat Buffy spoke of.
There are a few orders that I've read up on - I'm sorry, where was I?
- The monk.
Yes.
I'd like us all to start looking at these orders.
It's possible the one this monk belonged to was wiped out entirely You shouldn't be comin' in here.
You got a rep with these monsters.
Butyou come in here, night after night.
Were you lookin' to get killed?
I come for the ambience.
What can I say?
The place just reeks of class.
- Yeah.
Well, if Willy was here - Willy's not here.
Hit me.
Drinking alone?
It's not a good sign.
So they tell me.
I buy you a drink, neither one of us has that problem any more.
Now, do we?
- Vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic.
I'm Sandy.
Riley.
- This place is such a dive.
- No, no, it's great.
You just have to close your eyes.
Plug up your nostrils.
It's fine.
We could go somewhere else.
Someplace more private.
Oh, Sandy, Sandy.
It's no good.
My heart belongs to another.
Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
They're never interested in my intellect.
- Hi, baby!
- Hello, sweetbreads.
Have fun?
It was so exciting.
You wouldn't believe it.
I went to April Fool's and absolutely everything was on sale.
You paid for it?
Oh, no.
I just killed the clerk.
Still, a bargain's a bargain.
I ran into Carol Beets.
You know?
She sired Brandon, Brandon from the sewer gang?
And she said the Lei-Ach demon was recruiting his brethren to kill the Slayer!
How's that?
Apparently, he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission.
You thinkthey might actually do it?
Kill her?
God, that would be pleasant.
Well, if they do, I think we should do something.
Like a gift basket or something.
- Where are you going?
- To get a decent seat.
If the Slayer's gonna die, I'm gonna watch.
- Tara.
- Beth, what are you?
- I was looking for you.
- I'm sorry we didn't get to have dinner.
I just wanted to see if everything was OK.
See if you needed any help with anything.
Packing?
Beth, I'm not coming back with you.
- You're not?
- I don't think so.
- You selfish bitch.
- What?
You don't care a bitty bit aboutyour family, do you?
Your dad's been worried sick aboutyou every day since you left.
There's a house that needs taking care of.
Donny and your dad do for themselves, while you're down here living God knows what kind of lifestyle.
I can't wait till your little friends find out the truth aboutyou.
And they will, you know.
Doesn't matter how innocentyou act.
- They'll see.
- No, they won't.
They will, unless you do some kind of spell on them.
- You did!
- No!
You did something to them.
I'm telling your father.
No!
No, it wasn't anything!
You think you can just go around cursing people?
Your dad's gonna pop.
It was just so they wouldn't see.
So they wouldn't see the demon part of me.
Please don't tell Dad.
It's harmless.
I thought I heard something.
Don'tyou see how out of control you are?
You've lied to these people for a year and now you've put a spell on them.
Is that right?
Is that a human thing to do?
Now, I'm telling your father.
If he doesn't force you to come home, and he should, I know he's going to tell your friends the truth.
If I were you, I'd tell them first, and then I'd tell them goodbye.
- Do I get paid overtime for this?
- Certainly not.
- Dawn, would you close the door?
- I didn't open it.
Giles!
There's something in here!
Where'd it go?
Under there.
Go.
You'd be welcome.
Where'd it go?
It's over there!
- How many?
- I've been injured once this month!
Shut up!
Buffy, behind you!
- Tara, where is it?
Can you see it?
- Oh, God.
Blind Cadria, liftyour veil.
Give evil form and break my spell.
What in God's name is that?
Lei-Ach demon.
Fun little buggers.
Big with the marrow-sucking.
- I don't understand.
- I'm not sure I do either.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to hide.
I didn't wantyou to see what I am.
- Tara, what?
- What do you mean, whatyou are?
Demon.
The women in our family have demon in them.
Her mother had it.
That's where the magic comes from.
We came to take her home before Well, before things like this started happening.
You cast a spell on us to keep us from seeing your demon side.
That's why we couldn't see our attackers.
Nearly got us killed.
- I'll go.
I'm very sorry.
- The camper's outside.
Wait!
Go?
She just did a spell that went wrong.
It was just a mistake.
It's not the point and it's notyour concern.
She belongs with us.
We know howto control her problem.
Tara, look at me.
I trusted you more than anyone in my life.
- Was all that just a lie?
- No!
Do you wanna leave?
- It's notyour decision, young lady.
- I knowthat!
Do you wanna leave?
You're going to do what's right, Tara.
Now, I'm taking you out of here before somebody does get killed.
The girl belongs with her family.
I hope that's clear to the rest of you.
It is.
You want her, Mr Maclay?
You can go ahead and take her.
You just gotta go through me.
- What?
- You heard me.
You wanna take Tara out of here against her will, - you gotta come through me.
- And me!
Is this a joke?
I'm not gonna be threatened by two little girls.
- You don't wanna mess with us.
- She's a hair-puller.
And you're not just dealing with two little girls.
- You're dealing with all of us.
- Except me.
- Except Spike.
- I don't care what happens.
This is insane.
You people have no right to interfere with Tara's affairs.
We are her blood kin!
Who the hell are you?
We're family.
Dad?
You gonna let 'em just?
Tara, if you don't get in that car, I swear by God I will beatyou down.
And I swear by your full and manly beard, you're gonna break something trying.
Well.
I hope you'll all be happy hanging out with a disgusting demon.
- Excuse me.
What kind?
- What?
What kind of demon is she?
There's a lot of different kinds.
Some are very, very evil, and some have been considered to be useful members of society.
- Well, I What does it matter?
- Evil is evil.
Well, let's just narrow it down.
Why don't I make this simple?
- He hit my nose!
- And it hurt him, I mean!
- And that only works on humans.
- There's no demon in there.
It's just a family legend, am I right?
Just a bit of spin to keep the ladies in line?
You're a piece of work.
I like you.
- I'm not a demon.
- You're not a demon.
He hurt my nose.
Yeah?
You're welcome.
Mr Maclay, I would say your business here is finished.
Tara, for 18 years your family has taken care of you and supported you.
- If you wanna turn your back - Dad.
Just go.
Magic.
Are you happy now?
Sorry I'm late.
- You came.
- Of course I came.
No, see, cos your insect reflection represents your insignificance in terms of the karmic cycle.
But it's still not funny.
This place is so cool.
Except I have to wear this stupid stamp on my hand.
- That's to keep you from boozing it up.
- Oh, please.
Only losers drink alcohol.
So what's an eagle reflection?
My dance?
- Good birthday?
- Best birthday.
I still can't believe you didn't tell me aboutyour family and all that.
I was just afraid if you sawthe kind of people I came from, you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me.
See, that's where you're a dummy.
I think about whatyou grew up with, and then I look at whatyou are.
It makes me proud.
It makes me love you more.
Every time I Even when I'm at my worst, you always make me feel special.
How do you do that?
Magic.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Spike.
He's known as William the Bloody.
Earned his nickname by torturing his victims with railroad spikes.
Spike has fought two slayers in the last century and he's killed them both.
I can't bite anyone.
I can't even hit people.
I've got this cute little government chip in my head.
She's everywhere.
She's haunting me.
Buffy, I love you.
God, I love you so much.
God, no.
I need to know more about where I come from, about the other slayers.
Maybe if I can learn to control this thing, I could be stronger, I could be better.
You know, it's probably none of my business, but I just gotta ask.
Did you smell this bad when you were alive?
Cos if it's a postmortem thing, then boy, is my face red.
But, just so you know, the field of personal grooming has come a long way since you became a vampire.
You're going?
Butyou were havin' so much fun a minute ago.
Buffy.
What happened?
I can't believe I passed out.
Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
Yeah.
I like a girl who can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
- You said it wasn't that bad.
- I said I've seen worse.
There's a difference.
- Well, at least no major organs got kebabbed.
- I still think you need to see a real doctor.
Then I'd be in a real hospital, which would get my real mom real freaked out.
I can't do it.
Don't worry.
Accelerated healing powers come with the slayer package.
And the boyfriend with combat medical training?
That's just a Buffy Summers bonus.
So tell me about the bad guy or guys.
What do you thinkthey were?
- Vampire.
- How many?
One.
So, what?
He was a super-vampire or somethin'?
No, he was the regular kind.
He just beat me.
That ever happen before?
I'm in the best physical shape of my life.
If you're asking how it happened, I don't - Dawn.
- Sorry to interrupt the sex-capades.
I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.
- Hi, Riley.
- Hey, Mrs Summers.
How're you feelin'?
Fine.
Bordering on chipper and, tomorrow, planning on being obnoxious.
Glad to hear it.
Buffy, when you have a minute I'd like to go over the grocery list for next week.
- You got it.
- Are you disinfecting something?
Mine.
Some nail polish experiments are doomed before they even begin.
Butyou keep pushing the envelope, honey.
Did I just pull a slayer-related Mom cover-up thing?
- Come on, who's the man?
- You are.
A very short, annoying man.
If I show you something, you promise you won't tell?
Cool.
- I mean, gross.
- And Mom cannot know.
OK?
You'll help me with the household stuff?
I save your butt and you dump all your chores on me?
Dawn.
I got it.
You're covered.
We're good.
Just lucky it's not bikini season.
So, Dawn takes household duty.
I'll take tonight's patrol.
- By yourself?
- Just a sweep.
Do me a favour?
Will you take the gang along with?
OK.
I will patrol with the group tonight.
- When do I get to patrol?
- Not until you're Never.
What's with the hand move?
D'you see that?
Does it mean somethin'?
It's code.
I think it breaks down to "choo-choo".
It probably means to follow him.
That, or wait here for him.
Ask.
Riley!
What's the all about?
It means yell real loud so the vampires who don't know we're comin' will have a chance.
See, now he's all mad and sarcastic.
Because you were doin' all the yellin', Mr Stealthy Pants.
- It's their fault.
- If we split up, we could cover more ground.
I'll take the cemeteries, you guys get the Bronze.
Are we not being covert enough?
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.
We'll be sneakier.
Promise.
OK.
Just ditch the chips and watch my back.
Done.
You know what he's like?
He's like a cat.
You know, a big jungle cat.
How come I'm not like that?
It's just so cool.
I think you're cool.
Here's another one.
Early 18th-century slayer.
Good.
Let's hope she'll be more helpful than this last one.
- Why?
What does it say?
- Same as all the others.
Slayer called, blah, blah.
Great protector, blah, blah.
Scary battles, blah, blah.
Oops.
She's dead.
Where are the details?
Details?
Well, it says this slayer forged her own weapons.
Gotta love a gal with an anvil.
But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle?
You know, what made that fight special?
Why did she lose?
- You didn't lose last night, Buffy.
You just - Got really close.
I slipped up, Giles.
I've been training harder than ever and still I And there's nothing in any of these books to help me understand why.
I mean, I realise that every slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package.
But I want mine to be a long time from now.
Like a Cheeto.
If there were just a few good descriptions of what took out the other slayers, maybe it would help me understand my mistake, to keep it from happening again.
Yes, well, the problem is that after a final battle, it's difficult to get any Well, the Slayer's not She's rather It's OK to use the D-word, Giles.
Dead.
And hence not very forthcoming.
Why didn't the watchers keep fuller accounts of it?
The journals just stop.
I suppose if they're anything like me, they just find the whole subject too Unseemly?
Damn.
Love ya, butyou watchers are such prigs sometimes.
Painful, I was going to say.
Butyou're right.
Accounts of the final battles would be very helpful.
But there's no one left to tell the tales.
What?
Ow.
Wait.
Not ow.
Are you feelin' all right, Slayer?
This stuff usually hurts.
- Don't even start, Spike.
- What do you want?
Slayers.
You killed two of them.
I did.
You're gonna show me how.
There are quite a few American beers that are highly underrated.
This, unfortunately, is not one of them.
Update, Spike.
We're not here to discuss the fine choice of hops.
It's about two slayers: one in China during the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York.
Both got killed by you.
Tell the tale, you get the cash.
Right.
You wanna learn all about how I bested the Slayers and you wanna learn fast.
Right, then.
We fought.
I won.
The end.
Pay up.
- That's not what I - What did you want?
A quick demo?
A blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorise?
It's not about the moves, love.
And since I agreed to your little proposition, we can do this my way.
Wings.
- What?
- Spicy buffalo wings.
Order me up a plate.
I'm feelin' peckish.
Excuse me As I thought.
Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
Don't get all excited.
I'm fine.
Right.
Stuck with a creature you loathe, diggin' up past uglies, cos you're fine.
- Just tell me what I wanna know.
- I told you.
No one's narrating on an empty stomach here.
- Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
- Well, what can I tell you, baby?
I've always been bad.
Luminous.
No.
Irradiant's better.
Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?
Quickly.
I'm the very spirit of vexation.
What's another word for "gleaming"?
It's a perfectly perfect word as words go, but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.
Cecily.
I merely point out that it's a mystery, and the police should keep an open mind.
William, favour us with your opinion.
What do you make of this rash of disappearances in our town?
Animals or thieves?
I prefer not to think of such dark, ugly business at all.
That's what the police are for.
I prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.
- I see.
Well, don't withhold, William.
- Rescue us from a dreary topic.
Careful.
The inks are still wet.
Please, it's not finished.
Don't be shy.
"My heart expands.
'Tis grown a bulge in it, Inspired by your beauty, effulgent".
Effulgent?
And that's actually one of his better compositions.
Have you heard?
They call him William the Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry.
It suits him.
I'd rather have a spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff.
Cecily?
Leave me alone.
They're vulgarians.
They're not like you and I. You and I?
I'm going to ask you a very personal question and I demand an honest answer.
Do you understand?
Your poetry, it's They're not written about me, are they?
They're about how I feel.
Yes, but are they about me?
- Every syllable.
- God.
I know.
It's sudden and Please, if they're no good, they're only words, but the feeling behind them - I love you, Cecily.
- Please, stop.
I know I'm a bad poet, but I'm a good man and all I ask is thatyou try to see me I do see you.
That's the problem.
You're nothing to me, William.
You're beneath me.
Watch where you're going.
And I wonder what possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven, and brought this dashing stranger to tears?
Nothing.
I wish to be alone.
I see you.
A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength, his vision, his glory.
That and burning baby fish swimming all around your head.
That's quite close enough.
I've heard tales of London pickpockets.
You'll not be getting my purse, I tell you.
Don't need a purse.
Your wealth lies here and here.
In the spirit and imagination.
You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine.
Yes.
I mean, no.
I mean, Mother's expecting me.
I see whatyou want.
Something glowing and glistening.
Something effulgent.
Do you want it?
Yes.
God, yes.
Guys.
- Whatyou got?
- That's him.
Let's go.
- It sounds like a party.
- Forget about crashing.
There's too many of'em.
We'll come back at daybreak, when they're asleep.
It's OK.
We can kill 'em just as dead in the morning.
Nine in the corner.
So you traded up on the food chain.
Then what?
No, please.
Don't make it sound like something you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel.
Becoming a vampire is a profound and powerful experience.
I could feel this new strength coursing through me.
Getting killed made me feel alive for the very first time.
I was through living by society's rules.
Decided to make a few of my own.
Course, in order to do that, I had to get myself a gang.
Perhaps it's my advancing years that makes me so forgetful.
Remind me.
Why don't we kill you?
What's that?
It's Spike now.
- You'd do well to remember it, mate.
- I'm notyour mate.
- And when did you start talking like that?
- We barely got out alive because of you.
Everywhere we go, it's the same story and now You've got me and my women hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft - all because William the Bloody likes the attention.
This is not a reputation we need.
I'm sorry.
Did I sully our good name?
We're vampires.
- All the more reason to use finesse.
- Bollocks.
That stuffs for the frilly cuffs-and-collars crowd.
I'll take a good brawl any day.
And every time you do, we become the hunted.
I think our boys are going to fight.
The King of Cups expects a picnic.
- But this is not his birthday.
- Good point.
Yeah, you know what I prefer to being hunted?
Getting caught.
- That's a brilliant strategy.
Pure cunning.
- Sod off.
Come on, when was the last time you unleashed it?
All-out fight in a mob, back against the wall, nothing but fists and fangs?
Don'tyou ever get tired of fights you know you'll win?
No.
A real kill, a good kill - it takes pure artistry.
Without that, we're just animals.
Poofter.
Now you're gettin' it.
You can't keep this up forever.
If I can't teach you, maybe someday an angry crowd will.
That or the Slayer.
What's a slayer?
After that, I was obsessed.
To most vampires, the Slayer was the subject of cold sweat and frightened whispers.
But I never hid.
Hell, I sought her out.
If you're looking for fun, there's death, there's glory and sod all else, right?
- I was young.
- So how'd you kill her?
Funny you should ask.
Lesson the first: a slayer must always reach for her weapon.
I've already got mine.
Good thing, too.
Become a vampire, you got nothing to fear.
Nothing but one girl.
That's you, honey.
Backthen, it was her.
Just like I pictured it.
This good for you?
I'm sorry, love, I don't speak Chinese.
A fella could get used to this.
Spike, look at the wonderful mess you've made.
That's a slayer you've done in.
Naughty, wicked Spike.
You ever hear them say the blood of a slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
Here, now.
Have a taste.
- So where have you two been?
- May I tell?
No need to be humble.
My little Spike just killed himself a slayer.
Congratulations.
I guess that makes you one of us.
Don't be so glum, mate.
The way you tell it, one slayer snuffs it, another one rises.
I figure there's a new Chosen One getting chosen as we speak.
I'll tell you what, when and if this new bird does show up, I'll give you first crack at her.
I smell fear.
- Yeah, this whole place reeks of it.
- It's intoxicating.
Let's get outta here.
This rebellion's startin' to bore me.
It was the best night of my life.
And I've had some sweet ones.
What are you lookin' at?
You got off on it.
Well, yeah.
I suppose you're telling me you don't?
How many of my kind do you reckon you've done?
Not enough.
And we just keep comin'.
Butyou can kill a hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand, and the armies of Hell besides and all we need is for one of us sooner or later to have the thing we're all hoping for.
And that would be what?
One good day.
You asked and I'm tellin'.
The problem with you is you got so good you think you're immortal.
Not really.
I just know I can handle myself.
Then how do you explain this?
So that's it?
Lesson over?
Not even close.
Come on.
Killed with her own weapon.
They ought to put this in a museum.
You know what they put in museums?
Mostly dead things.
Give it to me.
- What?
- Lesson the second: askthe right questions.
You want to know how I beat 'em?
The question isn't "How'd I win"?
.
The question is "Why'd they lose"?
.
What's the difference?
There's a big difference, love.
- How'd you kill the second one?
- A bit like this.
- That didn't hurt?
- I knew I couldn't touch you.
If there's no intent to hurtyou, then that chip they shoved up my brain never activates.
lf, on the other hand - See?
Now, that hurt.
- Yeah?
This hurt, too?
Definite pain there.
How'd you kill 'em, Spike?
- You're not ready to know.
- I'm ready.
OK, then.
Went like this.
The first one was all business, but the second, she had a touch of your style.
She was cunning, resourceful.
And did I mention?
Hot.
- I could've danced all night with her.
- Think we're dancing?
That's all we've ever done.
And the thing about the dance is, you never get to stop.
Every day you wake up, the same question haunts you: "Is today the day I die"?
Death is on your heels, baby, and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.
And part of you wants it.
Not only to stop the fear and uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit in love with it.
Death is your art.
You make it with your hands, day after day.
That final gasp.
That look of peace.
Part of you is desperate to know: "What's it like?
Where does it lead you"?
And now, you see, that's the secret.
Not the punch you didn't throw or the kicks you didn't land.
She merely wanted it.
Every slayer has a death wish.
Even you.
The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is you've got ties to the world.
Your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies.
They all tie you here, butyou're just puttin' off the inevitable.
Sooner or later, you're gonna want it.
And the second that happens, you know I'll be there.
I'll slip in.
Have myself a real good day.
Here endeth the lesson.
I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did.
Get out of my sight, Spike.
Now.
Did I scare ya?
You're the Slayer.
Do somethin' about it.
Hit me.
Come on.
One good swing.
You know you want to.
- I mean it.
- So do I. Give it me good, Buffy.
Do it.
Spike.
What the hell are you doing?
Come on.
I can feel it, Slayer.
You know you wanna dance.
Say it's true.
Say I do want to.
It wouldn't be you, Spike.
It would never be you.
You're beneath me.
- Spike, what are you doing?
- "Beneath me"?
I'll show her.
Put her six bloody feet beneath me.
Hasn't got a death wish?
Bitch won't need one.
OK, I'm trying to be supportive here, so don't drive a stake through my heart.
Butyou can't kill Buffy.
She's the Slayer.
She is so gonna kick your ass.
I've got two barrels here that'll prove you wrong.
I knew you'd take this personally.
You are so sensitive.
How are you gonna kill her?
Think.
The second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all Then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she stakes you.
Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours, but she'll be dead just a little longer than that.
Fine.
But don't come crying to me when you fail.
You couldn't kill her before you got the chip.
You had plenty of chances.
- Why can'tyou kill her?
- You're the one who keeps bringin' her up.
I haven't said a word about the Slayer since we left California.
She's on the other side of the planet, Dru.
Butyou're lying.
I can still see her floating all around you, laughing.
Why?
Why won'tyou push her away?
But I did, pet.
I did it for you.
You keep punishing me.
Carrying on with creatures like this.
OK, you guys obviously have a thing going on here.
I have to find my pleasures, Spike.
- You taste like ashes.
- So this is my fault now?
I didn't know she was seein' somebody.
- I should take off.
- Yeah, why don'tyou do that?
You can't blame the girl, Spike.
You're all covered with her.
I look atyou, all I see is the Slayer.
- I put together that grocery list for you.
- Great.
Thanks, hon.
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
- Have you seen my conditioner?
- Did you look under the sink?
Where are you going?
I was hoping to put this off, but You knowthe "nothing" that I've been dealing with for the last couple of weeks?
It might not be nothing.
What is it?
I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation.
I'm getting a CAT scan.
It's only one night.
And they say, even if there is something, it's still very early if they didn't see it before.
I'm gonna be fine.
I know you will.
What do you want now?
What's wrong?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Is there something I can do?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You keep refusing to tell me where the Key is.
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.
- Dawn.
- What's wrong with Mom?
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - I don't know.
Buffy's like nobody else.
When I'm with her, it's like half of me is just on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her.
But she doesn't love me.
I know you got a lot on your mind.
If you decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
We could go somewhere else.
Someplace more private.
Sandy, Sandy.
My heart belongs to another.
Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
Spike, I wantyou.
God, I love you so much.
Oh, God, no.
Please, no.
Are you OK?
The "nothing" I've been dealing with the last two weeks might not be nothing.
What is it?
I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation.
I'm getting a CAT scan.
What is a CAT scan exactly?
I don't know.
It's some x-ray, I guess.
Where do they get the "CAT" scan from?
I mean, do they test it on cats or - Or does the machine sorta look like a cat?
- Dawn, I'm really "Your One-Stop Spot to Shop for all your Occult Needs".
- Catchy.
- Think so?
Uh-huh, in a hard-to-read sort of way, but I think it's great.
- I'm saying I think it's rude.
- I wouldn't call it rude.
Rude-ish.
Rude-esque.
Whatever you wanna call it.
If you make a destroy-all-vampires date, it's courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers.
Am I right, Giles?
I'm almost certain you're not but, to be fair, I wasn't listening.
The new phone book's in with Mr Giles's ad.
Nice.
- Am I mentioned?
- Not as such.
We were supposed to hook up with Riley to take on a nest o' vamps holed up in a tomb?
So we get there and guess what?
Tell him, Will.
- Tomb go boom.
- Yep.
Captain America blowed it up real good.
All by his lone-wolf lonesome.
- Rather reckless of him.
- I'd say very rather.
I should think you'd be pleased to avoid the confrontation.
That's what I've been saying.
I mean, I for one didn't wanna start my day with a slaughter.
Which really just goes to show how much I've grown.
Yes.
In any event, since you're all here, Tara and I could use your help researching Buffy's mysterious woman.
Oh, yeah.
This has been fruitful.
Trying to look up something you never saw and don't knowthe name of.
Just do what I do.
Flip through the pages and look busy.
It'd be nice if we knew where she was, where she's hiding out.
No doubt lurking around some sewer or condemned church or rat-infested warehouse.
You know, the usual haunts.
Most Beauteous and Supremely Magnificent One, this dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, Most Tingly and Wonderful Glorificus.
Please, call me Glory.
Get up.
Looking atyou is hurting my neck.
Forgive me, Shiny Special One.
I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.
Gimme.
I thought You should know, Your Elaborate Marvellousness, that this dark incantation has been lost for aeons, and great dangers have been faced Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
No.
No, Your Terrifically Smooth One.
It is the epitome of ankles.
To touch such an ankle would be But I'm not touching.
I'm backing away.
- Thank you.
- Dreg, is it?
Yes.
Dreg.
Your Creamy Coolness has honoured me by speaking my name.
- Your voice is like a thousand songbirds - I never tire of hearing that.
Look, just so we're clear, this spell's gonna work, right?
Nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work.
Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you.
It's this whole big thing.
It will work, Your Extremeness.
Provided you have the other items you need.
Don't worry.
I'll have them, all right.
I'll have it all.
Hello?
Buffy?
What are you doing in here?
What, me?
I was - What are you doin' here?
- Looking for the girl who'll rip your arms off - when she finds outyou were in here.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, me too.
Were you just smelling her sweater?
No.
Well, yeah, all right.
I did.
It's a predator thing.
Nothin' wrong with it.
Know your enemy's scent, whet the appetite for a hunt.
That's the stuff.
Slayer musk.
It's bitter and aggravating.
Out.
Watch it.
Easy, you're bruisin' the leather.
Look.
I knowfor a bleedin' fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me bein' here.
Right.
What's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies?
She in the habit of buyin' her enemies drinks?
Cos she spent the better part of last night with me, doin' just that.
Cos you guys are such tight pals.
That's good.
Tell me another.
OK.
Twice recently, she's had the lover-Wiccas do a de-invite on the house.
Keep out specific vamps.
Asked yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
- Because you're harmless.
- Yeah, right.
Takes one to know, I suppose.
At least I still got the attitude.
Whatyou got?
A piercing glance?
Face it, white bread.
Buffy's got a type, and you're not it.
She likes us dangerous, rough, maybe bumpy in the forehead region.
Not that she doesn't like you.
But sorry, Charlie, you're just not dark enough.
- Am I dark enough for you now?
- Pull me back in.
I'm startin' to sizzle.
You don't know anything about Buffy.
I know what she needs.
So you're at the hospital now, givin' her what she needs?
- What are you talking about?
- Don'tyou know?
Didn't she tell you?
- You tell me.
- Her mum's sickly.
Buffy took her to hospital for a bit of prod 'n' probe.
Bite-sized one went too.
You know, it's funny her not calling you about that.
I've known since last night.
Blanket!
- Riley.
- Sorry.
I heard.
I thought maybe you'd need I do.
I'm glad.
I just I didn't I mean, until we knew what it was I understand.
How's she doing?
Well, she's just had a CAT scan.
I was about to go in and find out.
Will you sit with Dawn while I talkto Mom?
- She's in the waiting room.
- Yeah, you got it.
Hi.
- May I come in?
- Of course, baby.
Come on in.
Where's Dawn?
With Riley.
Watching TV in the waiting room.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna check on the status of the OR.
The OR?
Dr Isaacs says I'm lucky there's one available on such short notice.
Some people wait for days, sometimes weeks.
Mom, what did they find?
A shadow.
I've got a shadow.
Somewhere over there.
He showed it to me, but they have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
The doctor says it's too early to be concerned.
Right.
- No concern.
- Right.
Just a shadow.
I wish we knew what we were dealing with.
It feels like we're going around in circles.
Our circles are going around in circles.
We've got dizzy circles here, Giles.
Weeping Buddha.
Shoulders your spiritual burden.
Makes a lovely paperweight, too.
- Maybe she's not in the books.
- What do you mean?
I mean, what if she's not a demon, sorceress or spirit, or whatever these books cover?
What if she's something else altogether?
Thank you.
Come again.
- Something new, you mean?
- Something old.
So old it predates the written word.
Giles, the Dagon Sphere.
You said that was created to repel That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named.
So, I'm thinking maybe she Predates language itself?
If it means I don't have to read any more, whoo.
And might I add a big "hoo".
If Tara's right, then we're blind.
There's no way we can determine her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next.
- I beg your - Uh-huh.
- I want these.
- Yes, of course.
- Did you find everything all right?
- No problemo.
That's your receipt.
And thank you.
She could be anywhere.
But if she is as powerful as Buffy says, I imagine it won't be long before she makes herself known.
Everything went fine.
They're moving her into Recovery now.
Do we have the results yet?
- Let's sit down over here for a minute.
- No.
Excuse me.
No, I don't mean to be rude.
It's just I've been sitting for hours.
I don't wanna sit.
I just Tell me, please.
Your mother has the term is "low-grade glioma".
It's a brain tumour.
The clinical name is oligodendroglioma.
It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum.
In your mother's case, the tumour seems to have started I knowthis is very difficult and, because of the nature of your mother's illness, unfortunately things may progress very quickly.
Things?
What things?
Symptoms.
There's a fair variety that might present.
Loss of vision or appetite.
Lack of muscle control.
Mood swings But what can we do?
Not much, until we determine if the tumour's operable, which we are working on.
Is there something that I?
I mean, can I help?
There's some literature you might want to look at.
If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of newtreatments that are very promising.
Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago.
Even if the tumour's not operable, she has a real chance.
What's "a real chance"?
Nearly one out of three patients with this condition does just fine.
Now, let me ask.
Does your mother's insurance company require copies of the MRI and pathology reports?
- I'm not sure.
- Well, just let me know as soon as possible.
And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment.
For instance, does she use a cellphone?
I think so, yeah.
She has one of those ear things.
OK.
Is your house near any power lines, chemical plants, waste-disposal facilities?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Well, the more we know I'm sorry.
Excuse me, Doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU.
- Excuse me, Miss Summers.
- It's OK.
You looked like you needed a break.
That guy's great, but he doesn't have that bone in his head that tells him when to back off.
You mean that they didn't need him?
I'm sure someone does somewhere.
They always do.
He really is a good doctor.
Your mom's in good hands.
Thank you.
- It's Ben, right?
- Right.
He was just telling me that there's nothing I can do.
And I'm gonna tell you the same thing.
Give yourself a break.
Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours.
- A break?
- Well, I just mean go out, get some air.
Come back later on this evening.
Talkto the doc then if you want.
My unsolicited advice for the day.
Buffy.
- It's bad.
- I know.
I have to do something.
- Do something?
- Yeah, like magic.
Like a healing spell.
Buffy, people get sick.
- I don't think magic can help.
- That attitude's not helping.
I have to try.
OK.
I need to talkto Giles.
Will you do me a favour and drop Dawn off at school?
Tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop when she gets off.
Of course.
Whatever you need me to do.
Buffy.
What do you want me to tell Dawn aboutyour mom?
Tell her we don't know anything yet.
- Your "heys" are startling the customers.
- And pretty much the state.
You sold someone a Khul's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone.
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Are you stupid or something?
Allow me to answer that question with a firing.
She's kidding.
An, we talked about the employee-employer vocabulary no-nos.
That was number five.
You never sell these things together, ever.
Bad news.
- Don'tyou know about the Sobekites?
- I do.
It was an ancient Egyptian cult, heavy into dark magic.
Wasn't the Khul's amulet a transmogrification conduit?
- Damn straight.
- But I still see no reason for concern.
The Sobekian transmogrification spells were lost thousands of years ago.
And the young woman to whom I sold them would have to have had enormous power Young woman?
Dear Lord.
What?
You're melting.
Guess I'm not hungry.
Maybe I'm not making this any better.
No, I just This is better.
I had my tenth-birthday party here.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
We'd just moved to Sunnydale.
Mom rented the carousel for an entire hour for just me and my friends.
Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so it was just me and Mom and Buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over again, for the whole hour, just so Mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.
She's She's not gonna get better, is she?
Absolutely she will.
Summers women are tough.
- I'm really glad you're here.
- Thanks.
Buffy's glad too.
Yeah?
She sure cries a lot less with you than she did with Angel.
Angel made her cry a lot?
Everything with him was all "Eee"!
, you know?
All?
You know, "My boyfriend's a vampire" crazy-crazy.
Every day was like the end of the world.
She doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
I think you've been really good for her.
So I figure there has to be some kind of mystical cure.
I mean like a potion or a spell or something.
We have to look.
We can look.
I mean, we will, but I haven't seen anything.
The truth is, the mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy.
Sorry.
The human mind is very delicate.
Too much could go wrong.
I've heard stories about people trying healing spells.
If we did something it could make things worse.
We've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
Why?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Anya broke a bippity boppity boo.
A thing.
Don't worry about it.
- I did not.
I didn't break - Anya.
Buffy doesn't need to hear aboutyour clumsiness right now.
My clumsiness.
I mean, that is so like me.
Slippery butterfingers.
- What happened?
- Nothing to concern you Giles.
The demon woman was here, the one who attacked you.
It's no biggie.
She just got an amulet and a bloodstone.
- That can create a monster.
- OK.
Biggie.
My God.
Are you guys OK?
I mean, no one got hurt, right?
No, thankfully.
No violence to speak of.
OK, so that's good.
How did she get away with this bad mojo stuff?
Giles sold it to her.
I didn't know it was her.
I mean, how could I?
If it's any consolation, I may have overcharged her.
Anya figured out what the demon lady's up to.
Yeah, a fewthousand years ago there was this cult, the Temple of Sobek.
Sobek?
Reptile demon.
Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
Just once I would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
Great.
Thank you very much for those nightmares.
Sorry.
Anyway, their high priest Khul had great mystic powers.
He forged an amulet with a transmogrifying crystal.
Transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
We've managed to decipher the markings that were on the bloodstone that I sold that she left with.
A cobra.
She's going to transmogrify a cobra.
OK, so she's making a monster.
What for?
What does it do?
That's the part We're working on it.
Well, you keep working on it.
I'll go kill it.
- Buffy?
- What?
I'm going.
- Buffy, this chick creamed you last time.
- I wasn't ready for her last time.
I am now.
- Butyou - But what?
Will, I can't just sit here.
I have to do something.
Chill, worm.
I'm gonna make you a star.
Chant.
Sobek, grant the power that it may mould this wretched creature, that it may be reborn, that it may serve.
Dark incantations.
Always overwritten.
Why can't they just cut to the Fight?
No fair.
Attacking when I wasn't even looking.
No, this is no good.
I'm out of the moment and you're not giving me anything I can use.
Dreg, I am not hearing chanting.
Continue.
Yes, Glory.
Work with me here.
There.
That feels more real, don'tyou think?
Even if I do have to carry your performance.
Scene.
Arise.
Arise.
Arise.
He is arisen.
'Bout damn time.
Spawn of Sobek.
The power is yours to see what is unseen, to find what is shrouded in shadow.
Already, you know what I seek.
I have given you form.
Nowfind for me the Key.
Seek it out in the holy places.
Yes, yes, yes.
Letyour vision guide you to its hiding place, then return to me and tell me where it lies.
Now would be good.
Fun, fun, fun.
"Aleister Crowley Sings"?
Sadly, no, I don't carry that, but I do have some very nice whale sounds.
Excuse me for a moment.
- Where's Buffy?
- She left a while ago.
What?
Where?
That creepy demon woman's conjuring some kind of monster.
And you let Buffy go after her?
Alone?
"Let" isn't really a factor when she sets her mind to something.
You knowthat.
She'll get herself killed.
It's crazy.
Yeah, crazy.
Going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much-needed backup.
Charging in with a big ol' hand grenade Oh, wait.
- This is different.
- Yeah, it is.
Buffy needs something she can fight, something she can solve.
I don't know what kind of action you're looking for.
Do you?
- I'm not trying to get - It's cool.
You OK?
Just a little crazed.
I hear ya.
If she needs me - Magic Box, your one-stop spot to shop for - Giles, it's me.
Buffy.
Are you all right?
No, I'm really not.
I couldn't stop her.
I couldn't even slow her down.
- Where are you?
- Sunnydale Memorial.
- Are you badly hurt?
I'll come right over.
- No.
No, I just wanted to warn you that that thing she conjured, it's loose.
It's a big snake thing.
Not Mayor big, but it's pretty lethal-looking.
- Do you know why she raised it?
- I don't know yet.
- I'll warn the others.
We'll get weapons - Wait a second.
What time is it?
- Half past four.
Why?
- School's out.
- Dawn's on her way over to you.
Giles - Understood.
- We'll keep her safe here until you arrive.
- Thanks.
- And Giles - Yes?
Dawn's kind of fragile right now, about Mom.
- She doesn't know how bad it is.
- We'll not say a word.
Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and I should be there when the doctors tell her.
She's in good hands, Buffy.
There's really nothing else you can do.
OK.
Bye.
Bye.
Is she awake yet?
Yeah.
She's waiting for us.
Can we take her home now?
We'll see.
Go getyour stuff.
- So, any monster-reptile sightings?
- None.
Tara and I did a mini-patrol earlier, but the biggie snake was nowhere to be - Dawn, are you OK?
- Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?
It knows.
- I've gotta stop it before it gets backto Glory.
- Glory?
He called her that.
She'll know Dawn's the Key if we don't We will.
Please, mistress.
Perturbed, Yet Ultimately Merciful One.
Please, no.
What is taking so long, Dreg?
You told me snakey-wakey would find my Key.
Why isn't he back with a beautiful message?
I grovel like a bug, Most Silky and Effervescent Glorificus.
Glory, Your Most Fresh and Cleanness, it's just a matter of time.
Everything takes time.
What about my time?
Does anyone appreciate that I'm on a schedule here?
Tick, tock, Dreg.
Tick frickin' tock.
- Do you want me to stay?
- No, I'm fine.
I think I should talkto Dawn alone.
OK.
Do I have bad hair?
I don't look like Scary Mom, do I?
No.
You look beautiful.
OK.
Let's do this.
Stay close.
I will.
Buffy.
You OK?
You look pretty beat up.
Minimal damage of the fighting kind.
It's all the other kind.
Come here.
It's OK.
Just let it out.
I'm right here.
I can't.
Not now.
They need me.
If I start now, I won't be able to stop.
Buffy?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": This dark spell I hold in my worthless hand is our gift to you, Glorificus.
Please, call me Glory.
- What if she's something else altogether?
- Something new, you mean?
Something old.
So old it predates the written word.
Lady, whatever you are, please I have two daughters.
The Key is energy.
- My brethren sent it to you.
- Dawn.
- She has no idea?
- No.
She thinks she's my kid sister.
I have to take care of her.
Your mother has low-grade glioma.
It's a brain tumour.
Listen, you two, I know this creamed spinach is delicious, but I won't be offended if you go out for some real food.
You kidding me?
This is the good life.
Relaxing in bed while people bring you food on trays.
- I like the Jell-O.
- Help yourself.
Food that moves by itself gives me the heebie-jeebies.
It's good and wiggly.
A girl at school told me gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet, and if you eat Jell-O some cow out there is limping with no feet.
But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em before they take off their feet.
Right?
You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
Oh, hello, Dr Kriegel.
You know my girls, Buffy and Dawn.
Yes.
You two are becoming part of the regular crew around here.
- Just keeping her company.
- Good.
- Just be careful you don't wear her out.
- Oh, don't worry about that.
I woke up exhausted.
There's really no more exhausted to get.
Well, maybe some good news'll help.
The blood work's back from the lab.
Everything's fine.
So we've scheduled your surgery for the day after tomorrow at ten in the morning.
How's that sound to you?
I thinkthey had me scheduled for volleyball, but I can work around it.
All right then.
Joyce, you take care.
Make sure and get some good solid rest.
And I mean that.
The day after tomorrow.
I can't stand to stay here another two days just waiting.
Waiting?
Give me a break, we got tons to do.
We have soap operas to watch and trashy magazines to read.
And an adjustable bed to fiddle with.
That alone will keep me busy for four hours.
I really don't need you to stay here.
I know you've got patrolling to do.
Not tonight.
Tonight I have "Mom taking care of' to do.
Riley's filling in with the others.
I'm sure they have it all under control.
- Human chest!
Human chest!
- Sorry!
My God.
What a rough night.
I dusted two of'em!
Yay on me!
That was pretty cool.
Except the part where I was all terrified and now my knees are all dizzy.
Not so much a big success night for me.
But I should get points just for showing up.
Unlike some Riley Finn who shall remain unnamed.
That was disappointing.
Things would have been easier if he'd come.
Piffle!
Who needs him when I'm dusting two at a ti Whoops.
Maybe it would've been good if he had showed up.
Perhaps he forgot.
Care package!
Special delivery for the Summers girls.
Let's see what I have in this sack of mine.
I feel just like Santa Claus, except thinner and younger and female and, well, Jewish.
This is an extra-special gift for your mom that I know she'll need.
A beer hat!
See?
It's got cup holders and a strawthat goes directly into your mouth.
You can fill it with other stuff than beer.
And somehow, when I was in the store, this seemed the most important idea, and nowthere's the whole part where I'm crazy.
It's perfect.
Thank you, Willow.
You're very sweet.
Let's see who's next.
Dawn, I believe I have something in here for you.
- Headache?
- Just a little one.
Biggish little one.
I'm fine!
Go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?
All right.
Dawn, to keep you busy.
Ooh, spells!
Thank you, Willow!
You got her a book on spells.
The girl who can breakthings by just looking at them now has a bookto teach her to breakthings by looking at 'em?
It doesn't actually have spells in it.
Just history and anecdotes, stuff like that.
Oh, Buffy, I have this for you.
Homework?
I don't believe in tiny Jewish Santa any more.
- And a yo-yo.
- Thank you.
The book is just in case you get a chance to look it over.
We're doing World War I now.
The last exam was really pretty easy, just underlying causes and trench foot.
- Should be no hassle to make it up.
- I don't know if I'll take that exam.
I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me!
Mom?
- I think I'm gonna take a little rest now.
- OK.
We'll be right outside if you need us.
What was she talking about?
I mean, that was weird.
- She's gonna be fine.
- It's OK.
I'm sorry.
The doctor spoke to me, and I should have told you.
The thing that's pressing on her brain, sometimes it might make her say weird things.
- Does she know she's saying them?
- Not really.
It's sort of like a flash.
Butyou saw her two seconds afterward - she was normal.
And after the operation, no more pressing.
She'll be all normal all the time.
- Is that right?
- Hey, Santa doesn't lie.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Careful, the facts say a picnic is in order.
What is that thing?
There's no data.
There's no pictures on this one there!
What is the data?
There's no one in there.
- Buffy?
- Come on, honey.
Don't worry about it.
I'm going home?
Home?
Home, home, home What's wrong with him?
Is it like Mom?
A thing in his head?
I don't think so.
I think it's different.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I missed that.
Was he bothering you?
Hey, Ben.
This is my friend Willow.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And, yeah, the crazy man was a little, you know, crazy, but it's OK.
- Are they gonna send him home?
- Don't get me started.
The mental ward's booked beyond capacity, nowhere to put them, so the ones with families are being sent home.
Like his family is able to take care of him!
He has to have someone watch him 24-7.
What was he saying to you?
Oh, he was just babbling.
- You know what's weird?
- Japanese commercials are weird.
Yes.
And also, you know, some of the stars we're looking at don't even exist any more.
In the time that it takes for their light to reach us, they've died.
Exploded.
Poof.
Were things rough at the hospital?
You know, I used to love to look up at them when I was little.
They're supposed to make you feel all insignificant, but they made me feel like like I was in space.
Part of the stars.
There's Canis Minor.
And Cassiopeia.
And the Big Pineapple.
You know, I'm not sure I remember that one.
Oh, it's a major one.
See those three bright stars right over there?
Yeah.
And see those stars along there?
That's the bottom of the pineapple.
- It's big.
- Hence the name.
The real ones never made sense to me.
I sort of have my own.
Teach me.
See those stars over there?
Short Man Looking Uncomfortable.
Moose Getting a Sponge Bath.
Little Pile o' Crackers.
That was a bit of a stretch.
You do it.
What would you call that one?
I see a huge flaming meteor about to crash into something.
I know what I said.
I said I won't go away far.
A person needs to respect a man get some fresh air and find some fresh spaces.
And some fresh space!
And needs to walkto get where he's going.
This thing doesn't work!
It isn't working!
I'm sure they heard you.
I bet it's not even hooked up to anything.
Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk.
I'm sure someone's What, the push buttons aren't hooked up to anything?
Oh, tell him, Buffy.
Tell him, OK?
- Look, Dr Kriegel, we wanna go home.
- Well, of course.
- You can visityour mother in the morning.
- No.
We.
I mean all of us.
My mom, too.
Well, I understand that, but it's not necessarily the first thing I'd recommend.
I can't.
I can't stay here waiting for two days for this operation.
I just can't.
- It makes my head hurt to be here.
- Joyce, there's no reason to get upset.
No reason to get upset?
Right, sorry.
I must just thinkthere is cos of my brain tumour!
Here, Dawn, why don'tyou get something from the machine?
- I'm sorry I said that.
I'm just tired.
- I know.
Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't take her home, you know, just until Wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace where she felt safe and comfortable?
Even if it would mean some work for you, taking care of her?
- Oh, thank God.
- I'll do it.
Anything.
There are medications to administer.
I'd have to show you how.
And I'd need for you to check her vitals, watch her pretty closely.
- I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep.
- I'm not much of a sleep person anyway.
- Can we go now?
Let's go now!
- Hold on!
Let me get all the medications and the instructions on howto do everything.
She's right.
Let's do this right.
We don't wanna forget anything.
Everyone stay close.
- I'm glad you called me in on this.
- Glad you answered.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about last time.
- Heard I missed out on some fun.
- Oh, yeah, fun was had.
Also frolic, merriment and near-death high jinks.
Look.
There it is.
Wow.
We have a meteorite.
Is it hot?
Cos if there's radiation, you could go all sterile.
No, it's not hot.
It's warm.
And broken.
- It's sort of - Hollow.
Yeah.
So, we're all thinking the same thing, right?
Festive piñata?
Delicious candy?
Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and slithered away to do badness.
In all fairness, I don't think we know about the "slithered" part.
Oh, no.
I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.
Let's look around.
Maybe we can figure out where it went.
It went here!
No pulse.
Yep, the space lamb got him.
- I don't see any marks on him.
- I know him.
He was at the hospital.
A mental patient.
They released him today.
- Riley, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure, there's something That might be toxic.
Don't touch it.
Yeah, touching it was my first impulse.
Luckily I've moved on to my second, which involves heaving and running like hell.
Oh, man, does that smell.
- So what do we do now?
- We can't call Buffy.
- I wanna call Buffy.
- You can't.
She's got life stuff.
That has to come first.
So we'll just figure this out ourselves.
We're experienced.
Yes, cos it seems like we're always dealing with creatures from space.
Except that we don't ever do that.
This is definitely newterritory.
Perhaps we should explore a bit more, head into the woods a bit.
- Who votes research?
- Better idea.
Good call.
Could've been other cases like this.
I'm gonna stay here, examine the body some more, look around a little bit.
Yeah, don't do anything hunterly.
No, no, I'm just not great at research, which I'm sure you guys figured out.
- I like me a good crime scene.
- Give us a call if you need help.
Believe me, if something jumps out at me in the dark, you'll hear me without the phone.
- Call me if you learn anything.
- You got it.
I don't wanna be the one that finds the bodies any more.
I need to speakto the man at the desk.
This is A This is Riley Finn.
You have an Agent Miller, Graham Miller.
He'll tell you who Yes.
Emergency frequency.
Cold.
Cold.
Wait!
You can't go!
Don'tyou be that kind of barn owl!
Please!
Please don't go!
Please!
Please don't go.
Please.
Please.
Please don't I can't see you!
I can't see you!
I can't see you!
Well, I guess we're all set, then.
You've got my home phone number, my pager number.
And here.
These are the medications I talked to you about - the sedative and so forth, painkillers.
Right.
No problem.
If this is gonna be too much, we can make your mom comfortable here.
No.
No, no, I got this.
We really, really appreciate You look just like your father when he cries.
And what do you think he was begging for?
- I told you she's been - I know.
Joyce?
Joyce.
We're all done here.
- Why don'tyou take your girls home now?
- Yes.
Yes, thank you.
- Thank you for all your help, Doctor.
- I'll see you in a couple of days.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Here we go.
Oh, it's nice to be home.
- Do you wanna go into bed, Mom?
- Oh, Buffy, no.
That light, it's too bright.
- It's too bright.
It's too bright.
- OK.
OK.
- Buffy, it hurts.
It hurts my eyes.
- It's off, it's off.
Shut off the lights in the living room.
I will take you upstairs and we'll shut off the lights.
Come on.
- You Finn?
- Yeah.
Major Ellis.
I'm in charge.
What's the situation?
Just the one civilian casualty?
That I know of.
This way.
You found a stiff in the woods and called us in?
Don'tyou usually call your girlfriend for this kind of thing?
I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
- Toxic?
- No, just messy.
Guy seemed to have simply choked on the stuff.
Near as I can tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid.
Does this fit the profile of any sub-T you know?
It's not subterrestrial, Major.
Extraterrestrial.
It came out of that.
- Set the trackers for a protein signature.
- Yes, sir.
No good, Major.
This alkaloid's breaking down at an accelerated rate.
- It's dissolving too fast to track.
- You got a better idea?
Thing came from space.
Gotta be some trace radiation.
We have Geiger counters in the packs.
Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise here.
Break 'em out.
Mom?
Oh, my God!
Mom, what are you doing?
I'm making breakfast.
You shouldn't eat any more.
You're disgustingly fat.
- Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing.
- You just need some rest.
We'll putyou backto bed.
OK, there you go.
That will help you sleep.
Come on.
Let's getyou all tucked into bed.
Don't touch me!
You you thing!
Mom, please!
Get away from me!
- You're nothing, you're a shadow!
- Mom - I don't know whatyou are or how you came.
- Mom, it's Dawn.
Dawn?
Honey, what's wrong?
She's just tired.
We all are.
Come on, go to sleep.
I'll check in on you in a little bit.
She hates me.
No.
She called me a thing.
She loves you.
OK?
She's not herself.
I told you what the doctor said about the tumour.
No.
Not just Mom.
People.
They keep saying weird stuff about me.
Are you talking about the man in the hospital?
He called me a thing, too.
And there was another one.
A weird guy outside the magic shop.
He said I didn't belong.
He said I wasn't real.
Why does everybody keep doing that?
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing.
It's notyou.
There's something that happens in people's brains when there's something wrong.
It's like a short circuit.
And it makes them feel like nothing's real except for them.
That's all it is.
Look, it is notyou.
OK?
And if anyone says anything like that to you again, don't listen.
Even if it's Mom.
- I hate it.
- I know.
Just don't listen.
Look at howteeny Mercury is compared to, like, Saturn.
Whereas, in contrast, the cars of the same name Xander, please, we have workto do here.
I still don't get why we had to come here to get info about a killer snot monster.
Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space.
I did not say that.
Demons enter our world in all sorts of different ways.
This one came from above.
And the library's astronomy section is the home of aboveness.
Got it.
Hey, digging this study material, too.
We've scoured the periodicals for other meteorite landings in the last week.
- Big zippo.
- Well, then the world is not being invaded.
- I'm pretty pleased about that.
- Guys?
I've got some stuff.
The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917.
Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow.
Maybe with a chewy demon centre like ours.
- Howfar back does this list of anomalies go?
- Pretty far.
- To the Queller impact in the 12th century.
- The what?
Queller.
I don't know why they call it that.
It didn't hit a place called Queller.
It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland.
Wait, I just saw Queller.
Quell Here, here.
"Primitive people used to believe the moon caused insanity".
"They would pray to the moon to send a meteor to fix the problem the moon caused".
"These meteors were expected to 'quell' the madmen".
The man in the woods - he was a mental patient.
And he got pretty well quelled.
OK, I'm looking in history right now.
It says in the Middle Ages there were these sweeping plagues of madness.
People were losing their marbles everywhere, but then it would suddenly subside.
And these dates look pretty close.
Like maybe it happened after each one of the meteor events.
As if something emerged from the meteors and quelled the madmen.
Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye.
Xander's little book made it sound like this Queller thing had to be summoned.
So who summoned it?
Who else?
My money's on Glory, our resident beastie summoner.
We should call Buffy.
Except we can't call Buffy.
- Can we?
- No, but we better call Riley.
- A Queller demon?
- Yeah, that's our perp.
- A scavenger that can be summoned to kill - Crazy people.
Yeah.
How'd you know?
- Cos I have five corpses at the mental ward.
- You're at the hospital?
Listen, Riley, I saw Buffy's mom earlier and she was acting kinda wacky.
Insane wacky, if you know what I mean?
It's OK.
Joyce was released earlier today.
That intern, Ben, told me.
- They're safe at home.
- Oh, good.
And the thing, the Queller, is it still there?
We've I think I've got it cornered in the air ducts.
Willow, keep at whatyou're doing.
Call me if you find out how I can kill it.
OK, but shouldn't we come help?
OK.
I wish someone had told me that there would be tennis being played!
I just didn't know.
Those eyes Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles!
Tell me.
Tell me because I need to know why.
Why are you staring at me like that?
What are you asking me?
You are asking me, aren'tyou?
Is this a test?
And if this counts for the final grade, I need to know now!
OK, teachers put this on the syllabus, but they do not stare down atyou, they do not cling, they do not look down on you.
Does someone know you're here?
They should have said.
You are not supposed to be here.
I need to rest now.
I don't like the way you're staring at me!
Did they tell you that at the gate?
Stop staring at me.
I don't like it!
- Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot.
- It stops?
A car.
It hitched a ride, probably underneath.
So much for containment.
So some poor mental patient checks out of here today, drives away with this thing, took it right to its own home.
- Checked out today.
- Get me a list of patients discharged No.
I know where it's going.
We've gotta move, now!
I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them you are going to go away.
Get off me!
Buffy!
Buffy!
- What?
What is it?
- Something's out there.
It's after Mom!
Stay in here.
Don't leave this room.
It's OK, my baby.
It's OK.
- Spike?
- Yeah.
Listen, did you hear a noise?
What the hell are you doing in my house?
Right then.
Caught me.
Your basement's full of junk.
And me being in need of junk - You were stealing?
- Yeah.
Can't exactly work at Burger Barn Wait.
Are those pictures of me?
Buffy!
Cover the room!
We're in.
Fan out!
Take the back!
Clear!
Are you OK?
You just missed a real nice time.
- It's gone.
I killed it.
- Oh, God.
- It's gone?
You promise?
- I promise.
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right.
It's strange.
A body might ask what exactly it is you think you're doing.
He might ask what all this was meant to accomplish because to a humble postulant it looks like chaos.
Like unnecessary attention drawn where it ought not to be.
- Get out.
- Sir.
Sir, forgive me.
I just want to understand.
Why summon the Queller?
What do you think?
Because I'm cleaning up Glory's mess.
Just like I've done my whole damn life.
Buffy, I'm gonna ask you something.
And if I'm being crazy, you just tell me, OK?
You got it.
The other day Actually, I'm not sure when.
The days seem to all bleed together.
- It's not important.
- No, I guess it isn't.
I do know I was pretty out of it, and I had not a dream exactly, more like I had this knowledge.
It just came to me like truth, you know?
Even though it didn't seem possible.
- Even though I shouldn't think such things.
- What?
That Dawn She's not mine, is she?
No.
She's She does belong to us, though?
Yes, she does.
And she's important.
To the world.
Precious.
As precious as you are to me.
Then we have to take care of her.
Buffy, promise me.
If anything happens, if I don't come through this - Mom - No, listen to me.
No matter what she is, she still feels like my daughter.
I have to knowthatyou'll take care of her, thatyou'll keep her safe, thatyou'll love her like I love you.
I promise.
Good.
Good.
My sweet, brave Buffy.
What would I do withoutyou?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Riley.
- I know you got a lot on your mind.
If you decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
But she doesn't love me.
Buffy, I love you.
- Oh, God, no.
- Your mother has a brain tumour.
Just me.
Sorry.
- Can I getyou anything?
- No.
Thank you.
- Riley?
- No, I'm fine.
- What time is it?
- There's a clock behind you, Will.
I know, but there's a watch right above your hand.
That can't be right.
I can't stand this.
What's taking so long?
- It doesn't mean anything.
- You think?
I'd worry more if she was out of surgery quickly.
Might mean they couldn't do much.
- OK, your mom's in recovery.
- What happened?
Is she all right?
It was possible to see the tumour completely, which means I was able to get all of it.
So, barring complications in recovery, I think your mother's going to be fine.
We're still going to have to watch her carefully, and have her back in here for some follow-up testing, but overall I'd consider the procedure a complete success.
My goodness, Doctor, thank you so much.
Believe me, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
Sorry.
When I was younger, I used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this, and Buffy would chase me around the house yelling "I'm the Slayer, I'm going to getyou".
That's disturbing.
You're emotionally scarred and will end up badly.
It was great.
She didn't actually stake me in the heart.
Buffy's pretty cool like that.
So, what do you wanna do now, Dawnster?
Keep in mind I won't chase you because I'm old and stuffed full of moo goo gai starch.
We could play that game again - Life.
That was fun.
For you.
You always win.
Well, we can make a wager this time.
You can give me real money.
That would be different.
And after we teach her howto gamble, maybe we can all get drunk.
The bar wouldn't serve her, but we could buy something.
- Strawberry schnapps tastes like ice cream.
- OK.
How's about a movie?
In a theatre.
I hear it's like watching a video with a bunch of strangers and a sticky floor.
- That one looks sad.
- The chimp playing hockey?
- Is that based on the Chekhov?
- There's a chimp playing hockey?
No, the other one.
I don't wanna see a sad movie.
We have to see the chimp playing hockey.
That's hilarious.
The ice is so slippery, and monkeys are all irrational.
We have to see this.
You pick, Dawn.
This is your night.
We are celebrating your mom's good news.
Go monkey.
Choose monkey.
It's OK.
You don't have to make a big deal for me.
I'm only sleeping over here so Buffy and Riley can boink.
No, that's not that's not it at all.
They just need time to be tender.
Relax.
He's not very convincing, is he?
"Alone time" means "Get Dawn out of the house so we can have loud, obnoxious sex".
Oh, does that mean we can't?
- Can we put this song on repeat?
- Whatever you want.
Can we put the whole night on repeat?
Absolutely.
Good.
I can't believe how relaxed I feel.
It's like all the tension's just left my body.
Already?
Cos I had that scheduled for a little later on.
Scheduled?
Are you planning on seducing me, Mr Finn?
Always.
I want tonight to be special for you.
It's more than special.
It's perfect.
I'm glad.
You deserve it after everything you've been through.
Well, it's nothing compared to what my mom had to deal with.
But it was a lot.
And you were incredible.
Not really.
Just covering for the weepy chicken within.
Don't sell yourself short.
You stayed strong throughout.
You never even cried.
Oh, I cried.
I cried so hard, I didn't think I was gonna be able to stop.
That's all in the past now.
Mom's out of the woods, and I'm here with you.
That's all that matters.
I don't know, Buffy.
I think I'd look like I had a cat on my head.
- But a very well-groomed cat.
- I think maybe I'll stick with a scarf.
Come on.
Wigs are fun.
We could getyou a whole bunch of different ones.
You know, you could be, like, Sixties Mom, Action Mom, French Maid Mom.
I must be getting better, cos you're makin' fun of me.
Well, you know.
Got a lot of time to make up for.
You have more important things to make up.
I know you've been missing a lot of school.
I may have to take a few incompletes, but I'll finish the semester.
Well, what about slaying and your friends?
I wantyou to have your life back.
Right now I'd rather be here, styling your beautiful, new, plastic dream hair.
Fair enough, butyou don't have to keep me company all night.
Go out, have fun, get Riley to take you to a movie or something.
- I gave Riley the day off.
- I don't think he thinks of you as a chore.
I knowthat.
I told him to make other plans because I wanted to have you all to myself, OK?
Besides, I can see him any time.
And I'm sure he'll come over later lookin' for a little Bible study.
Well, good.
I mean, just as long as the two of you are spending some quality time with the Lord.
We are.
Absolutely.
- What've we got?
- Belize.
Last transmission.
- Infrared scans say they're - Breeding.
They won't stay in that village for long.
Looks like we got ourselves a hot spot.
Tell the men to get ready.
What about Riley?
Agent Finn.
Sir, if we go in for a sweep and drop, he's definitely a guy we want.
Let's bring him on board.
It might take a little convincing.
Why?
What's he got here in Sunnydale that's so special?
- Riley?
- It's me.
Every time you show up like this, you risk all of your parts.
You knowthat?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a good reason.
As usual, I'm here to help you, and I Are you naked under there?
- Get out.
- No, I'm serious.
- Not about the naked part - Get out or I will drop you out headfirst.
I wanna show you something.
- What?
- You need to see this.
But we need to move if we want to get there in time.
Oh, please.
Like I give a bloody damn.
Don't start slayin'.
This isn't what we're here for.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just havin' a little look, mate.
Keep it down.
You can't go up there.
I said, keep it down.
Harder.
Buffy.
- Buffy.
- We only came here cos we care aboutyou.
You need help.
I thoughtyou should know.
Was that the Slayer?
What the hell are you doin' bringin' the Slayer here?
- Back off.
I didn't know.
- Nobody'll risk comin' here now.
I said, back off.
Get out.
I need to talkto you.
I'm not in a talkin' mood.
Then listen.
Riley, just give the man a chance.
If you don't like whatyou hear, we'll be on our way.
- Talk fast.
- We have a Code One in Belize.
A demon tribe is taking apart missionaries in the rainforest down there.
- You're tellin' me this because?
- We're goin' to terminate their operation.
We wantyou to join us.
- I'm a civilian.
- You're a soldier.
- I quit the government long ago.
- We're not government.
We're army.
Just like you.
It's not the Initiative, Finn.
We don't do experiments.
None of us give a damn what makes monsters tick.
We just stop 'em.
- What do you need me for?
- I think you can handle yourself.
And I always need bodies.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's the real deal.
High risk, low pay, and seriously messy.
We ship out for Central America tomorrow, midnight.
Now, maybe civilian life is workin' out for you and maybe not.
Midnight, tomorrow.
The decision's yours.
And so it begins.
No longer a victim of crass holiday commercialisation, I'm a purveyor of it.
Who ordered more chickens' feet?
The ones we have aren't moving at all.
That's what happens when you cut them off the chicken.
I'm serious.
Maybe we could do a holiday promotion.
- One free with every purchase.
- Oh, yeah.
Dear holiday memories.
Merry tykes by the fire, enjoying their new Christmas chicken feet.
Aw, holding them tight as they fall asleep.
Painting their little toenails.
That's very humorous.
Make fun of the ex-demon.
I can just hear you in private.
"I dislike Anya.
She's newly human and strangely literal".
What?
I don't say that.
No one says that.
No one talks that way.
There's nothing wrong with my idea.
I've been very good for this store.
If not for me, Giles would be a terrified old man staring at a tax bill and wetting himself.
- I say, that's an exaggeration.
- Anya, you've helped a lot, but I have, too.
I forgot about the vigorous sitting around.
Anya, you can back off a little.
You get paid.
Willow's doin' this on her own time.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for making time in your busy life to come and get in the way of mine.
- Anya, play nice.
- You know, fine.
Take her side instead of mine, even though I sleep with you and feed you and bathe you.
- She bathes you?
- Only in an erotic, Penthousey way, not in a sponge-bathy, geriatric sort Please.
Stop, I beg of you.
I need to find out everything I can about a vamp nest downtown.
- A nest?
What sort of - There were people there.
It looked like they were paying vampires to bite them.
Now I know what to give the person who has everything.
- Who'd pay to get bitten?
- That's been going on for centuries.
Humans hire vampires to feed off them.
They, you know, get off on the rush.
And the danger.
The hazards of the underworld can be addictive to some people.
- Why don't the vampires kill them?
- They get cash, hot and cold running blood, and they don't leave corpses behind so they don't get hunted.
But still, it can be terribly dangerous for humans.
People can die accidentally, or meet a vampire who only pretends to play by the house rules.
You knew about this and you didn't tell me?
I haven't seen it since my Ripper days.
I had no idea it was going on in Sunnydale.
Well, it is.
And I'm gonna stop it.
Buffy, even if I had known about this, I might not have told you right now.
- What?
Why?
- It's not where your efforts are best spent.
Perhaps you should focus on a less ambiguous evil.
Glory, for instance?
You said people are dying.
They're willing victims.
People deserve your help who aren't.
Vampires are vampires.
And my job description is pretty clear.
- Are you coming with me or not?
- What's the rush?
If we're goin' into a nest, maybe we should come up with a strategy, wait for Riley.
Back me up or not.
I'm going.
Anya, will you mind the store?
Have a nice day.
Don't get killed.
I don't understand.
This place was doing serious business last night.
I guess everybody jumped ship once the word got out that the Slayer found their crib.
- I apologise for the use of the word "crib".
- You thinkthey'll set up shop again in town?
It's hard to say.
I'm sure they'll lie lowfor a bit.
There's gotta be a way to find these creeps.
- Don't worry, you'll find 'em.
- Yeah.
You'll get them next time, champ.
What took you?
Takes a while to get to full strength after a good bite.
Hey!
Let's be reasonable about this.
You may have noticed, Spike, I left reasonable about three exits back.
Look, I'm not the one who gotyou into this.
Don't kill the messenger.
Why the hell not?
Bloody hell!
Oh, God!
Plastic woodgrain.
Looks real, doesn't it?
Don't think I don't know what's goin' on with you, Spike.
Stay away from her, or we'll do this for real next time.
Oh, man.
You're really under it, aren'tyou?
What?
Look atyou.
All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
Because you are.
Well yeah.
But that's notyour problem.
Even if I wasn't in the picture, you'll never hold onto her.
- Bloody hell!
- Maybe I didn't almost kill you enough.
Come on.
You're not the long-haul guy and you know it.
- Shut up.
- You know it.
Or else you wouldn't be getting suck jobs from two-bit vampire trulls.
The girl needs some monster in her man, and that's not in your nature.
No matter how low you try to go.
You actually think you got a shot with her?
No, I don't.
A fella's gotta try, though.
Gotta do what he can.
If you touched her, you know I'd kill you for real.
If I had this chip outta my head, I'd have killed you long ago.
Ain't love grand.
Sometimes I envy you so much, it chokes me.
And sometimes I think I got the better deal.
To be that close to her and not have her.
To be all alone even when you're holdin' her.
Feelin' her, feelin' her beneath you.
Surrounding you.
The scent.
No, you got the better deal.
I'm the lucky guy.
Yeah.
I'm the guy.
- How long has she been in there?
- A while now.
Seems pretty gung ho about it, too.
Didn't even stop to say hello.
When we went to deal with that vampire nest, she got all Rambo and torched the place.
- Something really bad is going on with her.
- I don't know.
Maybe you're overreacting.
Who hasn't done stuff like that from time to time?
I made a guy spontaneously combust.
He set his village on fire.
Can you stop being scary for a minute and listen to what I'm tryin' to tell you?
- She in there?
- She's training.
Would you guys mind clearin' out?
I need a minute alone with her.
After-hours hanky-panky in the training room, huh?
- Xander and I could tell you some stories!
- Not now.
Let's go.
- There's a thing with the vaulting horse - Anya.
What?
You started it.
In yourworld, OK.
But here, this isn't the time for tales of Anya and Xander's Sex Capades.
Well, maybe we can go home and, you know, have 'em.
Actually, I've got some stuff to take care of.
- We need to talk.
- I'm not ready to talkto you yet.
Too bad.
I'm serious.
Unless you wanna fight.
So let's fight.
We need to have this out, Buffy.
Right now.
And say what?
"What were you thinking?
How long have you been lying to me"?
Nothing you say right now is gonna make this better.
I realise that.
I don't expect I just need you to hear me out.
Fine.
Getyour hand off of me.
I think when this thing started, it was just some stupid, immature game.
To get even after you let Dracula bite you.
- I did not let Dracula - I know.
On some level I knowthat.
But I was still spun.
I don't know I wanted to know whatyou felt.
I wanted to know why Dracula and Angel have so much power over you.
You so don't get it.
I wanted to get it, Buffy.
I wanted to getyou.
So this is my fault?
"Hey, gee, Buffy's so mysterious, I think I'll go out and almost die".
"I think I'll go and let some other" This isn'tyour fault.
It's mine.
And I feel like hell for what I've putyou through.
But it's just - These girls - Vampires.
Killers.
They made me feel something.
Something I didn't even know I was missing until I can't.
I can't hear this.
You need to hear this.
Fine.
Fine.
Tell me aboutyour whores.
Tell me what on earth they were giving you that I can't.
They needed me.
They needed your money.
It wasn't aboutyou.
No.
On some basic level it was about me.
My blood, my body.
When they bit me, it was beyond passion.
They wanted to devour me, all of me.
Why are you telling me this?
It wasn't real.
I know.
It was just physical.
But the fact that I craved it, that I kept going back, even if it was fleeting, they made me feel like they had such hunger for me.
And I don't make you feel that way?
How on earth can you compare me to that?
How can you say you understand what those vampires feel?
You weren't a passion to them, you were a snack.
A willing, idiotic snack.
I know exactly what they feel when they bite me.
I feel it every time we're together.
It's like the whole world falls away, and all there is is you.
And you thinkthat I don't feel the same way aboutyou?
- How dare you tell me what I feel?
- You keep me at a distance, Buffy.
You didn't even call me when your mom went into the hospital.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you when I thought my mother was dying.
It's about me taking care of you.
It's about letting me in, so you don't have to be on top all the time.
But I do.
That's part of what being a slayer is.
And that's what this is really about, isn't it?
You can't handle the fact that I'm stronger than you.
- It's hard sometimes, yeah.
But that's not it.
- Then what?
What else do you want from me, Riley?
I've given you everything that I have.
I've given you my heart, my body and soul.
You say that, but I don't feel it.
I just don't feel it.
Well, whose fault is that?
Because I'm telling you, this is it.
This is me.
This is the package.
And if it's so deficient that you need to getyour kicks elsewhere, then we really have a problem.
They want me back, Buffy.
The military.
It's deep undercover.
No contact with civilians.
Transport's leavin' tonight.
Tonight?
When were you gonna tell me about this?
I'm tellin' you now.
- Are you going?
- I don't know.
- If we can't workthis out - Then what?
This is goodbye?
You are unbelievable.
- You're giving me an ultimatum?
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
You expect me to get over it now or you're gone.
- That's not what I meant.
- I have heard enough.
- I will not take the blame for this.
- I'm not asking you to.
- Let go of me.
- Or what?
You'll hit me?
Go ahead.
Come on, do it.
- Get outta my way.
- I'm serious, Buffy, hit me.
Hit me.
I'm leaving, Buffy.
Unless you give me a reason to stay, I'm leavin' tonight.
The pyro act was a bad idea, Slayer.
- Felt pretty good to me.
- I'm not runnin'.
And you're not shuttin' me down.
In fact you're not gonna make it through the night.
Walk away.
I'm serious.
Don't do this.
Not now.
So, how'd that work out for ya?
Make you feel better?
- What are you doing here?
- I thoughtyou might need to talk.
Then I sawthe skirmish.
I was gonna lend a hand, but I noticed you grew a few extra ones.
Go home, Xander.
Buffy.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. Something's up.
You're actin' like a crazy person.
Take this, for instance.
You don't wanna deal, so you hide?
Not very slayerlike.
Just leave me alone.
You have no idea what's going on.
No?
Good.
So you and Riley aren't imploding?
Doesn't take a genius.
What I can't figure out is how you never saw it coming.
What?
Who told you?
Nobody told me anything, Buffy.
It was right in front of my Xander face.
- The guy would do anything for you.
- The guy got himself bit by a vampire.
He lied to me.
He ran around behind my back and almost got himself killed.
And now he tells me that he's leaving with some covert military operation at midnight unless I convince him not to.
Nowtell me thatyou understand.
Because I sure as hell don't.
You gonna let him go?
- It's not my decision to make.
- Of course it is.
- Well, it's not fair.
- Who cares if it's fair?
In about 20 minutes, Riley's gonna disappear, maybe for ever, - unless you do something to stop him.
- What am I supposed to do?
Beg him to stay?
- Why wouldn'tyou?
To keep Riley here - I don't even know who he is any more.
I mean, I thought he was dependable.
- Dependable?
What is he, State Farm?
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
I think you mean convenient.
You took it for granted he'd show up when you wanted, and take off when you didn't.
Look who has Anya following him around like a lovesick puppy.
- Oh boy, is this not about me.
- Is she more than a convenience?
Cos that would kinda be a surprise.
- If you don't wanna hear this, I'll shut up.
- Good, cos I don't.
I lied.
See, what I think, you got burned with Angel, and then Riley shows up.
- I knowthe story, Xander.
- Butyou missed the point.
You shut down, Buffy.
And you've been treating Riley like the rebound guy, when he's the one that comes along once in a lifetime.
He's never held back with you.
He's risked everything.
And you're about to let him fly because you don't like ultimatums?
If he's not the guy, if what he needs from you just isn't there, let him go.
Break his heart, and make it a clean break.
But if you really think you can love this guy - I'm talkin' scary, messy, no-emotions-barred need - if you're ready for that, then think about whatyou're about to lose.
Xander Run.
Riley!
Riley!
Riley!
I gotta say something.
Cos I don't think I've made it clear.
I'm in love with you.
Powerfully, painfully in love.
The things you do, the way you think, the way you move.
I get excited every time I'm about to see you.
You make me feel like I've never felt before in my life.
Like a man.
I just thoughtyou might wanna know.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.
Dawn.
- OK, your mom's in recovery.
- ls she all right?
l think your mother's going to be fine.
- l wanna show you something.
- Harder.
Buffy.
l've given you everything that l have.
My heart, my body and soul.
l just don't feel it.
They want me back, Buffy.
The military.
l'm leaving tonight.
Riley!
You ever have that feeling where there's something to do and you forgot what it was?
Nope.
l've been having that feeling and l just realised what it was.
Three weeks ago Riley asked me to borrow a Crescent wrench.
l keep having this feeling l'm supposed to give it to him.
That's not going to happen unless he comes back.
You know, not to get the Crescent wrench.
Just to come back.
l just mean, sometimes l sort of forget that he's gone.
lt's, like, ''Where's Riley?
'' ''Oh, wait, the Central Republic of Where-ln-The-Hell.
'' Xander?
lf you ever decide to go, l want a warning.
You know, big flashing red lights and one of those clocks that counts down like a bomb in a movie, and there's a bunch of coloured wires, and l'm not sure which is the right one to cut, but l guess the green one, then at the last second ''No.
Red.
'' And then it stops with three tenths of a second left, but then you don't leave.
- Like that, OK?
- Check.
Big bomb clock.
Come here.
Maybe it's her.
Well, maybe it won't happen to us because it's all about her messing things up.
She couldn't make it work with Angel, and then she let Riley go away.
Yeah, relationship debris is kind of piling up on the Buffy highway.
Humans make the same mistakes over and over.
l saw it when l was a vengeance demon.
Some guy dumps a girl, she calls me, l exact vengeance, blah, blah, blah.
The nextyear, same girl, different guy.
After you smite a few of'em you start going ''My goodness, young lady.
'' ''Maybe you're doing something wrong here too.
'' l don't think it's a pattern with her.
No, it's just You know, nowthat it happened again, man number two, l wonder how she's dealing with it.
- Sister Abigail, the choir is ready.
- Thank you.
What was that?
He looked like a demon.
Yeah, he did.
Are you OK?
- Yeah, l think so.
- Here.
So, about being a nun.
You know, with the whole abjuring the company of men.
How's that working for you?
The abjuring.
Good.
Yeah.
Do you have to be super-religious?
- Well - How's the food?
All right.
Switch.
Left lead.
You thinkthey might be able to help us?
lf you mean are they gonna help us find out something about Glory l sawthat coming.
You're dropping your shoulder.
The resources that the Watchers' Council have at its disposal - The Central Library alone is just - Don't talk about the books again.
You get all And sometimes there's drool.
l'm sorry, but we've exhausted the materials l have here, and we're coming up empty.
You're still dropping your shoulder.
l can see when you're going to go with your right.
You're doing it again.
Sorry.
So, Glory's all you're gonna talkto them about, right?
- Let's take a break.
- Answer me.
l'm not going to mention Dawn's name.
l wouldn't do that, l promise.
Butyou're gonna tell them about the Key?
That Glory's looking for something called the Key?
Well, knowing her goal is crucial.
l mean, if anything helps them uncover her origins, her plans l know.
lt's just, l trust these watchers about as far as you could throwthem.
Thank you very much.
l'm freaked about the idea of giving them any information that could lead them to Dawn.
Truly, Buffy, if l saw an alternative lf the lnitiative were still around, l'd consider using them, but they're gone, and Riley was the last link we had to the government.
- l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to - lt's OK.
You can say his name.
l'm doing all right.
These things happen.
People break up and they move on.
For a while it feels like the end of the world but, big picture Not so huge.
Not so huge?
l just said it feels like the end of the world.
Don'tyou listen?
l'm teasing.
Sort of.
l'll be OK.
Well, l do hate to go if you're feeling badly.
Look, if it helps you find out something about Glory, l'm thrilled to have you gone.
You're going away for a week?
That's great.
- Yes.
Everybody seems delighted about it.
- l get to run the store, right?
You?
Well, it's quite a lot for one person to take care of.
The trashmen, for example.
They've been making such a mess in the alley the recycling people can't get in to collect.
- Somebody has to talkto them.
- l can take care of that.
l'm envious, Mr Giles.
A trip to England sounds so exciting and exotic.
- Unless you're English.
- Don't worry about the shop.
- We can open, close and deal with everyone.
- We can come by between classes.
Usually l use that time to copy over my class notes with a system of different-coloured pens, but it's been pointed out to me that that's, you know, insane.
l said quirky.
Hello.
l work here.
l'll take care of everything.
- Yeah, Anya can do it.
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Well said.
- Yes, well, Anya, while l completely trustyou to take care of the inventory and the money, dealing with people requires a certain finesse.
l have finesse.
l have it coming out of my bottom.
l can completely lie to the health inspector.
l can distract him with coy smiles and bribe him with money and goods.
See there?
She'll be great.
Don't worry.
l'll help her take care of everything.
lt'll be shipshape.
Better, it'll be shopshape.
Xander, she's talking to Giles like l'm not here.
Make her stop.
- Perhaps l'd better call the airline.
- l'm trying to help.
Tell her.
- Schedule an earlier flight back.
Excuse me.
- Tell her that l don't need her help.
- So, how goes the slaying?
- l killed something in a convent last night.
ln any other room, a frightening declaration.
Here, a welcome distraction.
- Tell us all about the killing, Buff.
- Pretty standard.
Vampire staking.
But l met a nun, and she let me try on her wimple.
OK, now we're backto frightening.
You with the actual clothing, who are you?
- Dawn, come look at this.
- ls it hard to recognise me?
No more bathrobe.
l looked at it today and there it was, all fuzzy and blue, and l just couldn't stand it any more.
l don't thinkthe rest of us will miss it much.
- lt was getting a little ripe.
- Maybe we should burn it.
- lt would keep the bugs away.
- lt doesn't smell.
Fine, make your funny jokes at the expense of the woman with the hole in her skull.
Let's go.
l think we've tired her out.
- Whatyou doing?
- Playing soccer.
Can l hang out in here?
Don't touch anything.
- You took down his pictures.
- Yeah.
l think l would've done that sooner.
Like: ''Don't wanna see that face again.
'' lt wasn't like that.
l was never angry with him.
OK, that's a lie.
But it's not like l didn't want to see his face.
l was just starting to kinda like the guy, and then he's gone.
So fast.
lt wasn't really so fast.
Him leaving.
According to everyone who isn't me, it was kind of gradual.
- Does that make it any better?
- No.
Because you should have noticed earlier?
Stop being insightful.
lt's creepy.
lt hurts.
ln all kinds of horrible ways.
ln the way where l'm furious at him, in the way where l blame myself, in all the little ways l imagine how l could have fixed things.
lt'll get better.
Won't it?
l hope so.
Yes.
lt has to.
l'll just keep going like l have been, and every day it'll get a little bit better.
Really?
Every day?
Not really.
But it'll be better soon.
lt still feels a little sudden to me, with him gone where no one can talkto him.
Butyou never know.
Maybe he'll come back.
Maybe he'll hate the jungle or maybe he'll want to give it another try.
l could say all the things l didn't get to say.
There's somethin' l got to tell you about showing you Riley in that place.
l didn't mean to Anyway, l know you're feeling all betrayed - by him, not me.
l was trying to help, you know.
Not like l made him be there, after all.
Actually trying to help you.
Best intentions.
l mean, pretty state you'd be in, thinkin' things were all right while he's toddlin' halfway round the bend.
l'll insult him if l want to.
l'm the one who's on your side.
Me.
Doin' you a favour, and you bein' dead petty about it.
Me, gettin' nothin' butyour hatred and your venom and You ungrateful bitch.
Buffy, there's somethin' l wanted to tell you.
Good, and hellebore?
- lt's up and to the right.
- Hellebore, one of my favourites.
lt's powerful stuff.
l tried to use it to de-ratAmy and it didn't work.
But l think it might have made her really smart.
She keeps giving me these looks like she's planning something.
Rubbing her paws together.
What are you two doing?
- We're gonna try out a few spells.
- There's this thing where you create light, and we thought, what if we could make simulated sunlight?
Yeah, so there Buffy is, middle of the night, and she finds this whole nest of vamps, and then she just goes ''Presto!
'' Only it won't be ''presto'' exactly.
And there's a floating ball of sunlight.
- Vamps get dusty.
- Don't look right at it, though.
That's swell, butyou can't use this stuff.
Giles has only been gone two days and you're already causing trouble.
- You shouldn't do things while he's gone.
- You're the fish.
- What?
- The fish in the bowl, in The Cat in the Hat.
He was always saying that the cat shouldn't be there while the mother was out.
- What are you talking about?
- A book.
This cat does all this mischief.
lt's so cute.
He balances a bunch of stuff, including that fish in the bowl.
And But don't try it when you're six or you're not allowed to have fish for five years.
You're referencing literature l have no way to be familiar with so that l feel left out, and you're stealing.
l'm not stealing.
l'm just taking things without paying for th - ln what twisted dictionary is that stealing?
- Maybe we should just pay.
Anya, Giles would be totally fine with this.
Come on, it'll be fun.
We could show you howto do some stuff.
You could be floatin' pencils by tonight.
Sometimes l miss having powers.
l know what this is.
This is peer pressure.
Any second now you'll make me smoke tobacco and have drugs.
Look how easy.
Don't float the merchandise.
Stop that.
Look at this.
My two favourite girls.
Three favourite girls.
Xander, Willow's stealing.
She's a burglar.
Right.
The cunning, broad-daylight in-front-of-everyone burglar.
Xander, l'm just doing a spell to help Buffy.
Xander, Giles left me in charge.
Tell her.
- Judge Xander requesting a recess.
- You shouldn't pull him into this.
Yeah, see?
Tara's with me.
Protect me, Tara.
Xander, what l'm doing, it's a good thing.
And if it doesn't work, Giles never even needs to know about it.
Oops.
The cash resister.
What did you do with it?
Dear God.
l'll fix it.
Recursat.
There, all back.
Good as new.
Money.
Did you hurt the money?
Money good?
She endangered the money.
Of course, that's what she cares about.
''l like money better than people.
'' ''People can so rarely be exchanged for goods and/or services.
'' - She's pretending to be me.
- Can you even believe how she's acting?
Know what?
l'm tired of being in the middle.
- l won't letyou pull me into this.
- l'm not.
Whatever the issue is between you two, just figure it out without me.
Xander, don't go.
- You made him mad.
- Me?
Tara, who do you think he was more mad at?
You know, l think maybe you guys have some stuff you need to work out.
You know, just really talk.
- Fleabane.
- 15 cents.
- Salamander eyes.
- Ten bucks for twelve.
Bargain.
- Bindweed.
- That's a pricey one.
Would you stop that?
lt's very distracting.
Fine.
Make your little ball of sunshine.
l'll be quiet.
Good, because this spell is very sensitive.
Once l begin, any nonritual word can disrupt it.
Fine.
OK, here we go.
- Did you startyet?
- No.
This is it.
Spirits of light, l invoke thee.
Let the gloom of darkness part before you.
Let the moonlight be made pale by your presence.
Spirits ls it done?
Spirits of light, grant my wishes.
- l'm sorry.
l thoughtyou were done.
- Do you wanna screwthis up?
No.
l'm sure you can do that all on your own.
Anya, whatever really has you mad, why don'tyou just say it, like you do every thought that stomps through your brain?
- l believe l have said it.
- No.
You haven't.
Come on.
Let it out.
He's not a ball of sunshine.
New semester, new classes.
Whole new vistas of knowledge to be confused and intimidated by.
l thinkthis one's gonna be fun.
GreekArt is gonna touch on so many things.
- Mythology and history and philosophy - The professor spit too much when he talked.
lt was like being at SeaWorld.
''The first five rows will get wet.
'' That was just enthusiasm.
lt seemed very much like saliva.
- We'll sit farther back next time.
- Good plan.
l need to keep this course.
The only other thing that fits into my schedule is Central American Geopolitics.
And no, thank you.
l even hear the word '' jungle'', and all l can think of is him.
You know, ''ls that the one Riley's in?
'' Really don't need a daily two o'clock knife in the heart.
ls it that bad?
Sort of.
But l'm starting to get perspective on the whole situation.
Maybe Riley's where he's supposed to be.
Maybe he needed to be where he was needed.
Willow says that things always happen for a reason.
Butyou ever notice people only say that about bad things?
But not for me the furrowed brow.
What do you say we go pick up Willow and indulge in an after-school hamburger?
We could.
She might still be at the magic shop.
l was there earlier and she and Anya kinda got in this squabble.
Xander and l cleared out.
He was pretty upset.
Anya and Xander are in trouble?
No, l said that all wrong.
lt was nothing.
Willow and Anya were fighting, and then Xander snapped at both of them and he left.
He left?
Xander leftAnya?
No.
Not ''left her'' left her.
He just left.
lt was only a little thing, really.
Little thing?
See, the thing is, the little things get bigger, and if you don't catch the little thing, then you have this whole huge thing.
Not them with the little things.
They can't break up.
- l think - They have a beautiful love.
l thinkthey'll be fine.
- They have a miraculous love.
- What?
A miraculous love.
That car.
We're still on his trail.
l don't even get how we made that guy because, wow, advanced.
No one made him.
He must have been trapped in that crystal, and you released him.
l released him?
No, this was definitely a ''we'' thing.
Or a ''you'' thing.
lt definitely feels like a ''you'' thing.
Look, just find the reversal spell.
And hurry.
Look what he did to that lamppost.
l'm trying.
Put the top up.
The pages are all blowy.
l don't know howto.
l only just figured out what the left pedal does.
lt makes us stop.
You don't know howto drive?
Why didn'tyou say?
Well, l couldn't know if l could until l tried, could l?
This is very, very bad.
There's an ogre on the loose Troll.
- What?
- Troll on the loose.
Now hold on.
l'm gonna press the right pedal harder.
l expect us to accelerate.
There's a troll loose and you're gonna crash Giles' car.
lt's likely.
You should have listened to me and not done the spell.
- Giles put me in charge.
- He can be an idiot.
The smart kind, but still.
- Xander agreed.
- Right.
Xander doesn't step out of line.
- Well, what do you mean by that?
- Nothing.
- Find that spell quickly.
- That's gone.
Watch it.
lt's you.
Spike, don't let me stop you from not being here.
l was here first, you know.
Go away.
Why would l do that, when it's buggin' you so much having me here?
They have chicken wings, too.
Also a sort of a flower-shaped thing made from an onion.
lt's brilliant.
Are you talking to me hoping l'll get so depressed l'll impale myself on a fork?
Lovely thought.
lf l don't hurtyou myself, the chip wouldn't zap me.
l could eatyou.
- Beat the onion thing all to hell.
- Those are mine.
My, my.
Someone's in a temper.
This all sympathetic misery borrowed from the Slayer?
What?
No, nothing to do with Buffy.
So she's all right, then?
Not holding grudges?
What are you talking about?
What does Buffy have to do with anything?
What grudges?
OK.
No need to talk about it, then.
l'm sure she's merrily slaying some pals of mine, havin' a grand old time.
This is very bad.
Willow?
Anya?
They're not backthere either.
They're gone.
Buffy, something's been here and Willow's gone.
Don't worry.
We'll get her back, l promise.
Come on, this thing's probably leaving a huge trail.
Puny receptacle.
You do well to flee, townspeople.
l will pillage your lands and dwellings.
l will burn your crops and make merry sport with your more attractive daughters.
Mark my words.
Ale.
l smell delicious ale.
They get in these fights and they both look at me like l'm the referee.
l'll say something aboutAnya, and Willow'll get this ''what do you see in her?
'' look.
l knowthat look.
A lot of people never really got Dru.
Well, she was insane.
Then l get all torn because Willow's my best friend and l really value her opinion, butAnya's my girlfriend.
What does the Slayer think of all this friction in the ranks?
- Can't be good for morale.
- l don't know.
She's a little preoccupied, maybe.
lt's understandable, what with all the upset, all that blamin' of innocent bystanders.
- What?
- l mean, did she want to be made a fool of?
And what does a person have to do to make it right?
Watch it, mate.
On second thought, do whatyou like.
Ale.
Yes.
Fragrant ale.
So, think l should run get Buffy?
Barmaid.
Bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat.
l'm gonna run get Buffy.
Or maybe you could fight him.
l could do that, but l'm paralysed with not caring very much.
You there.
Do you know where there are babies?
- What do you think?
The hospital?
- What?
Shut up.
- Listen - l find myself very hungry.
- When l'm hungry l grow short of patience.
- Well, we can take care of the ''hungry'', so how's aboutyou just sit down in one of the sturdier chairs and we could have a calm talk and something to eat?
- Can it be babies?
- Well, not so much.
But maybe some roast pigs and stags and - much hearty grog.
- They've got this onion thing You cannot appease me.
Do not try.
More ale.
Xander.
You shouldn't be here.
There's a troll.
A big guy?
Hammer?
l think l noticed him.
l wish Buffy was here.
l'm here.
l wish l had a million dollars.
- Just checking.
- What's going on?
Where did he come from?
Hello, Buffy.
Willow stole ingredients and released him from a purple crystal.
He's a troll.
- You did this?
- Me?
No, we.
- l mean, us.
Her.
lt's very complex.
- We can stop him.
Willow, do the spell.
- ''Let the conjuring be'' - Stop.
- Nobody lets me finish.
- You told the witch to do that, Anyanka.
You seem determined to put an end to all my fun, just like you always did when we were dating.
You dated him?
- You dated a troll?
- And we're what?
Surprised by this?
Well, he wasn't a troll then.
He was just a big dumb guy, and he cheated on me and l made him into a troll, which, by the way, is how l got the job as a vengeance demon.
l did not cheat.
Not in my heart.
lt was only one wench.
l had had a great deal of mead.
The next thing l know, l'm a troll.
You did this, Anyanka.
You will die for this.
Butyou seem to enjoy the being a troll.
l adjusted.
And then what happened?
Witches.
Filthy, dirty, disgusting witches.
They trapped me.
l was imprisoned in that crystal for centuries.
A curse on all witches.
All must die.
- Willow, again.
- ''Let the conjuring be undone.
'' - ''Return the beast to native form.
'' - Witch, stop.
''Keep him far from us and ours as long as my voice shall sound.
'' - lt did not work.
- OK, wait.
''Let the conjuring'' - Where is he?
- Gone.
Xander, follow him.
Anya, Willow, go to the magic shop.
Find a spell that will stop him.
- What are you doing?
- Makin' this woman more comfortable.
l'm not samplin', l'll have you know.
Just look at all the lovely blood-covered people.
l could, but not a taste for Spike.
Not a lick.
l know you wouldn't like it.
You want credit for not feeding off bleeding disaster victims?
Well, yeah.
You're disgusting.
What's it take?
Hurry up.
l'm taking everything on relocation spells, suspension spells, and - what the heck - spells to make him really sleepy because slightly better.
ln case we need 'em, l'm getting more of all the things you stole.
- l didn't Why do you do that?
- What?
You're so rude.
l mean, sure, at first, ex-demon, doesn't knowthe rules.
- Well, you been here for ever.
Learn the rules.
- Rules are stupid.
Great, whatever.
l just thoughtyou might be interested in learning to act more human.
Some of us enjoy it.
Look for spells with dimensional portals, too.
l am a human.
And there are many humans who are stranger than me.
Uh-huh, but unless l'm really wrong about Crazy Larry at the bus stop, he's probably not gonna turn Xander into a troll.
Well, now, that's a very complicated proced You think l'm gonna hurt Xander?
l would never hurt Xander.
- You really think l would do that.
- Anya, it's whatyou do.
You spent, what, a thousand years hurting men?
You gotyour ''thousand years of hurting men'' gold watch.
l was a demon then, and l don't even have any powers now.
ls this the spell?
Only if you want him to double in size and grow extra arms, which Let's not.
And by the way, you weren't a demon when you turned Olaf into Lord of the Hammers.
You managed that.
Also, there's other ways to hurt Xander.
l don't do magic now.
You're the one with that kind of power.
D'Hoffryn offered you my old job.
You're closer to being a vengeance demon than l am.
- Xander should be afraid of you.
- He's my best friend.
You don't want anyone else to have him.
l know what broke up him and Cordelia.
- lt was you.
And your lips.
- No, it was not.
Well, yes it was so, but that was a long time ago.
Do you think l'd do that again?
- Why not?
- Well, hello.
Gay now.
Butyou're always doing all you can to point out how much l'm an outsider.
You've known him since you were infants.
You'll always know him better than l do.
You could poison his mind against me.
You're insane.
l am not gonna take him away.
- And l am not gonna hurt him.
- Well, l'm not either.
l knew it.
You two, performing more spells.
l could be out pillaging, devouring babies, making merry with the local virgins, but instead, l had to come all the way back here to kill you.
Run.
No.
Get away from them.
l will get away from them, after l kill them.
You are not touching these women.
You wish for more?
Admirable.
You fight well, although you are a tiny man.
l shall reward you.
Only one of your women shall die, and you shall be the one to choose.
- Did he just say?
- Choose.
Anyanka or the witch.
One of your women must die.
No.
You are one crazy troll.
l'm not choosing between my girlfriend and my best friend.
- That's insane troll logic.
- Go, Xander.
l love you.
Good for you.
You are a loyal man.
Xander.
Now.
Choose.
- Olaf, no.
- l'm not choosing.
Then you shall be the one who dies.
No.
Choose me.
Just don't take him.
Don't take Xander.
E conspectu abeat monstrum.
Damn.
- Buffy.
- Tara, stay back.
The hammer.
His strength's in the hammer.
- How can l help?
- Distract him from Buffy.
- Piss him off.
- l don't know how.
Anya, l have faith in you.
There is no one you cannot piss off.
Olaf, you're as inadequate a troll as you were a boyfriend.
You're hairy and unattractive.
Even women trolls are put off by your various odours.
lnstrumentum ultionis, telum fabuloso, surge, surge, terram pro voca.
Your menacing stance is merely mildly alarming.
- And your roar is less than full-throated.
- Desist.
My God, woman.
lt's been a thousand years and yetyou are as aggravating and emasculating as ever you were.
Vola cum viribus, dominum tuum nega.
Vola.
- Good job.
- You too.
Very irritating.
So.
Your power's in your hammer?
Oh, yeah.
l forgot he still has all that troll strength.
You shall all die.
l will dispense no mercy now.
What are you fighting for, minuscule blonde one?
Your friends?
These two?
They will never last.
Anyanka is very difficult to live with, and he He's ludicrous and far too breakable.
Their love will never last.
She's got him now.
Poor baby.
You really dated him?
Yes.
- Butyou like me better.
- Yes.
And Willow likes you too, but not in a sexy way, cos she's gay.
She's not gonna try to break us up, so it's all OK.
Their love will last for ever.
The transposition be complete.
- Where did you send him?
- The land of the trolls.
He'll like it.
- Full of trolls.
- lt's hard to be precise, though.
Alternate universes don't stay put.
Trying to send him to a specific place is sort of like trying to hit a puppy by throwing a live bee at it.
Which is a weird image, and you should all just forget it.
lt's possible that he's in the land of perpetual Wednesday or the crazy melty land.
Or the world without shrimp.
There's a world without shrimp?
l'm allergic.
He's probably in troll land.
l only care that he's not here, and l got this nifty souvenir.
Oops.
The place is trashed enough anyway.
But see how well things worked out?
And look atyou guys.
So good and alive and together.
So together and good, and alive.
Oh, God.
l'm just so happy for you.
l cringe to think what the place would have looked like if l'd been away for longer.
Maybe we would have had time to clean it up if Willow used some magics to help.
Yes, cos nothing could possibly go wrong with that.
Rupert, l still don't understand - thank you - why the other watchers made you go to England when they don't know anything.
Well, they don't know ityet.
l mean, they had no record of Glory or anyone like her, but based on the information l've given them, they're gonna look into it.
They might have something soon.
What about the Key?
Were they all over it?
Yes.
You know all of this?
l got some of it myself.
Buffy told me the rest.
Well, they're interested, certainly, and full of theories.
Most of them nonsensical.
They don't knowthat it's Dawn?
No.
l still can't even begin to grasp this.
l mean, she's my little girl.
lt is disorienting.
Giles, what happens if they figure it out?
What would they do?
l don't know.
l can't even think about this.
lt's too l'll get some more milk.
ENGLlSH
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Whenever a slayer turns 18.
It's a time-honoured rite of passage.
It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.
- We're finished.
- Not quite.
She passed.
You didn't.
I have recommended to the Council that you be relieved of your duties as Watcher.
You're fired.
- The Council's orders are to concentrate - I don't think I'm taking any more orders.
Tell your Council, until the next slayer comes along, I'm not working for them any more.
- What about the Key?
They all over it?
- They're interested.
But they didn't guess about Dawn?
They don't knowthat it's her?
No.
Here, I'll get that.
Sorry.
Mom's still not 100 per cent and I haven't been taking up the slack.
- No, the place looks fine, Buffy.
- Yeah, it's just us.
That must have belonged to Aren't we supposed to have a meeting?
Yes, we're here for a reason.
I've had some rather Well, I've had some news.
It seems that the Council of Watchers has found some information that may help us out.
- About Glory?
- Presumably.
We'll find out when they arrive.
Could be very important.
Arrive?
They're coming here?
Now?
Why do they have to come here?
Don't they have phones?
"'Allo, Buffy!
Here's some stuff we know, pip pip".
Yeah!
Phones.
I'd like them on phones.
What's so bad about them?
Aren't they good guys?
I mean, watchers, that's like other Gileses, right?
Yeah, they're scary and horrible.
They can appear a bit well, hard-nosed.
But their agenda is the same as ours.
They want to save the world and kill demons.
Kill the current demons, right?
Current demons.
Giles, I don't want them to come here.
I don't trust them.
Make them not come here.
They're already on their way.
Our old friend Quentin Travers is heading up a delegation.
Their test almost killed me.
And when I was Faith, they almost killed me again.
I can't handle almost being killed right now.
I don't like the sound of this.
They don't sound very ex-demon-compatible.
Are you sure they're English?
I thought they were gentler than normal people.
Maybe it won't be so bad this time.
I mean, Buffy, they did think you were Faith last time.
Nowthey know you're you, maybe they won't care enough to kill you.
It's not just that.
They're gonna screw everything up.
It's a delicate time right now.
I have to take care of Dawn, and But that's not new.
You've always taken care of her.
Right.
Right, I knowthat.
It's just, you know, there's Glory.
I don't need them looking over my shoulder when I don't know what we're dealing with.
That's precisely why we need to talkto them.
Dawn, honey, what are you doing up at this hour?
Go backto bed.
- I was just getting a snack.
- Dawn, are you listening?
I can get a snack if I want to.
- She was listening.
- Does it matter?
I mean, is she really gonna set the junior high school buzzing with "There's a delegation a-coming"?
No, I guess not.
You know, it's just sometimes we say stuff, and it's all good.
Giles, you were saying something?
Just that if the Council knows something about Glory, her agenda or her origins, then maybe it will help us get a grip on what we're dealing with.
Right now I think we're a bit lost.
Mistress!
Oh, God!
Please don't hurt me, I beg of you!
If you just let me go, I swear I won't tell anyone!
- Help her!
- We're here for you, Great One.
- Drink.
- What is this?
What the hell are you things doing to me?
Very good.
Delicious.
No, I'm good.
It's OK.
I know you're all always looking at me.
I can tell.
Always tell.
I can see.
My hat.
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Try not cutting things so close next time, understood?
- Yes.
We live to serve.
- As always.
Cool.
Take this mess out with the rest of the trash.
And you have something to tell me?
- Indeed, Glorificus.
- And I'm waiting.
We have found that the signs of the alignment are moving faster than expected.
Meaning?
If you are to use the Key, you must act quickly.
Fine.
I have been cooling my heels in this crappy little town long enough.
Sunnydale's got too many demons and not enough retail outlets.
All you need is the Key.
Yes, and I bet Mousy the Vampire Slayer has an idea where it is.
If I may remind Your Eminence, you don't have much time.
Baby, if that girl's the only thing between me and my Key, I don't need much time.
If you're serious about this, madam, you need to be very careful.
Measure precisely, and please don't step ahead.
He's quite right.
Wouldn't want to do anything dangerous.
Turn the wrong person into a badger.
Quentin.
I didn't realise you were here.
Evidently.
It's been a while.
I see you've brought some of our colleagues with you.
Would you care to introduce us?
First I thought we might catch up.
Well, certainly.
This is the shop, obviously.
It's been a very interesting transition into the world of retail.
It's going rather well.
I'll give you a grand tour if you like.
That's all right.
I think I can see whatyou've been up to.
Yes, well, I do limit my time here, obviously.
Buffy and I have been training a great deal these days.
There's a back room that we Yes.
I thoughtyou were keeping that space for the really dangerous items that should be kept out of the public's hands.
- Or maybe you don't worry about that.
- I'm very careful.
Most of this stuff couldn't harm anyone.
Incense, dime-store trinkets - But there are some things - I'm sorry, who are you?
There are some very potent elements here.
Focusing crystals, runic artefacts, an amulet of Cauldis.
Also this statue.
Its removal from Burma is a criminal offence, and when triggered, it has the power to melt human eyeballs.
In that case I severely underpriced it.
Giles, sorry, but this is just for the duration of our stay.
I think you can see why.
What?
What is just for the duration?
Magic Box shoppers, we're going to have to ask you to leave.
The store is closing early today.
Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
Hey!
Giles, what are they doing?
Customers, please bring your money back.
You knew you'd do this before you even sawthe place.
I'm sorry.
It's just for the duration of the Council's review.
Council?
You're the Council?
Welcome to our store.
We're closed now.
I'll be in the back.
What review?
Let's just stop and talk about this.
Miss?
Excuse me, you work here?
Yes, I do.
Ever since I moved here from Indiana, where I was raised by both a mother and a father.
Anya, just go.
You don't have to talkto him.
She works for me.
Now, tell me about this review.
No one said anything to me about this.
Let's sit down and talk about it over here.
You all stand around and look sombre.
Good job.
You used to respect us, Giles.
You used to be one of us.
You used to pay me.
If you recall, firing me was not my idea.
Touché.
Butyou were on the inside once.
You know what sort of resources we command.
We've discovered information about this creature, your Glory.
Some of it is clearly vital, the rest merely extremely disturbing, and it won't be handed over until we're convinced thatyou and your slayer are prepared for it.
Thus the review.
I'm not having you put her through another of your insane tests.
It's not a test.
It's a check of her methods.
We need to knowthat this information is safe.
You can trust her.
Buffy's come very far recently.
She's acquired a remarkable focus.
Now, Rasputin was associated with a certain obscure religious sect.
They held the tenet that in order to be forgiven, one first had to sin.
Rasputin embraced this, and proceeded to sin impressively and repeatedly.
The notion that he was in fact evil gained strength years later, when the conspirators who set out to kill him found it nearly impossible to do so.
- "Nearly impossible"?
- I'm sorry, there was a question?
Miss Summers, of course.
I about, you know, killing him You know, they poisoned him and they beat him and they shot him, and he didn't die.
Until they rolled his body in a carpet and drowned him in a canal.
But there are reported sightings of him as late as the 1930s.
There is near consensus in the academic community regarding Rasputin's death.
There was near consensus about Columbus, until someone asked the Vikings what they were up to, and they're, like, discovering this America-shaped continent.
I just I'm only saying, you know, it might be interesting if we came at it from, you know, a different perspective, that's all.
Well, I'm sorry if you find these facts so boring, Miss Summers.
Maybe you'd prefer I step aside, so thatyou can teach your own course.
Speculation 101 perhaps?
Intro to Flights of Fancy?
- I only meant - What was ityou were on about last week?
Mysterious sleeping patterns of the Prussian generals?
Now, some of us are here to learn.
Believe it or not, we're interested in what actually happened.
It's called studying history.
You can sit down now.
Unless you have something else to add, Professor?
"Miss Summers"!
"Some of us are here to learn, Professor"!
- "Maybe you'd like to teach your own class"!
- Who are you talking to?
Spike, why did you do that?
Not for money, if that's whatyou're thinking.
Your heartfelt gratitude's plenty.
- Expect I'll be getting that any moment.
- Gratitude?
For getting in my way?
Getting in your way?
I saved you.
I was regrouping.
You'd have been regrouped into separate piles.
You needed help.
I didn't need you.
I never need you, Spike.
I get it.
You just don't like who did the rescuing, that's all.
Wishing I was your boyfriend.
Wait, he's run off.
I don't need a boyfriend, to rescue me or for anything.
Don't need or can't keep?
You make notches in the headboard, but eventually they get up out of the bed and run off, don't they?
- You're disgusting.
- Rough talk.
Maybe that's your problem.
Maybe you push 'em away.
Or is it the other?
Maybe you cling too much.
Or maybe your beauty's fading.
The stress of slaying ageing you prematurely.
Things not as high, not as firm.
You know what, Spike?
The more I get to know you, the more I wish I didn't.
Or maybe you just don't hold their interest.
Begging permission to speak with you, sir.
Don't touch me.
You're crusty.
What do you want?
Not me.
The magnificent Glory.
She wants more information on the Slayer.
She knows you know her.
The Slayer?
I don't know any slayer.
Get away from me.
You shouldn't be here.
I believe you do, sir.
She's short, symmetrical, hair on top?
- Buffy something.
- Buffy Summers is the Slayer?
That's the one!
Very clever of you, sir.
- The Slayer.
How does Glory knowthis?
- I do not know.
I was not there.
But the beauteous Glory said for you to tell us, please, where her dwelling is.
- Who her friends are.
- Why?
So Glory can find her, do something to her?
Why would I do that?
I don't know, sir.
She just said to tell you to do it.
For her.
That was her message.
Well, I've got a message for Glory, too.
We've been developing a sort of hybrid fighting style.
Let me outline her progress and I think you'll see thatyour review isn't strictly needed.
Bad day.
Bad, bad Miss Summers.
Good to see you again.
- Mr Travers.
- Giles is telling us of your training regimen.
Perhaps you'll favour us with a demonstration while we're here.
- Right now?
- No need to rush you.
They're staying a little longer than I'd anticipated.
We've already laid out our project for Mr Giles.
Nigel?
An exhaustive examination of your procedures and abilities.
- Observe your training, talkto your friends - My friends?
Yes, we understand you're still taking civilians out on your patrols.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Buffy, I can sense your resistance.
I don't blame you.
Butyour watcher hasn't reminded you lately of the status of the players in our little game.
The Council fights evil.
The Slayer is the instrument by which we fight.
The Council remains, the slayers change.
It's been that way from the beginning.
That's a very comforting, bloodless way of looking at it.
Giles, let me talkto Buffy, because I think she's understanding me.
Glory is stronger than you.
She's a more powerful instrument, if you will.
We can help you.
We have information that will help.
Pass the review and we give it to you without reservation.
Fail the review, either through incompetence, or by resisting our recommendations Resisting your recommendations?
She fails if we don't do as you say!
How much under your thumb do you think we are?
- How much do you want our help?
- She's notyour bloody instrument!
Giles!
I understand you thinkthis is unfair.
There are factors which should motivate you to go along with the review.
I don't want to do this, but obviously we could shut this place down permanently.
You can't.
You don't have that kind of power.
Of course we do, and a great deal more.
If you insist on fighting us, we'll arrange to have Mr Giles deported within the day.
Never set foot in this country again.
Now, perhaps you're used to idle threats and sloppy discipline, Miss Summers.
Butyou're dealing with grown-ups now.
Am I making myself clear?
Jinx!
Hey, what's the deal with your face?
It's a message from Ben.
He isn't going to help.
Isn't going?
- Isn't going to help?
- No.
All he has to do is turn over that squirming slayer girl.
I have business to do with her.
If she knows where I can start looking for my Key Why won't he help?
He knows her.
He could go to her, he could talkto her He could seduce her and bang the Key out of her!
- He is quite attractive.
- Well, of course he's attractive!
But he drives me insane.
You know what I mean?
- He drives you insane?
- Yeah!
That's it exactly!
Sweet, lumpy minion.
You're the only one that understands.
Probably cos I haven't sucked your brain outyet.
He makes me so mad!
If I could just get my hands on him!
You know?
I'll just find her myself.
It's a power play, that's what it is.
It's about who has the power.
I'm guessing they do?
Big power outage in Buffy County?
I should have setyou on them, that's what I should have done.
Giles, that Travers guy is, like, 60.
I can't hit him.
- Can I?
- I suppose not.
Well, I could.
I think I will.
Can they really do what they threatened?
Kick you out of the country?
In a heartbeat.
The rough stuff, they're all right at.
They're ham-handed, but they get it done.
But this stuff, the bureaucracy, the pulling of political strings, they're the best in the world.
They can kill you with the stroke of a pen.
Poncy sods.
Am I gonna be able to get through this review?
Well, I suppose they'll make it as difficult as they want to.
The physical stuff could be a bit of a challenge.
That's not what I'm worried about.
It's the other stuff.
Examining decisions I've made.
I mean, twice I've been within slaying distance of Glory, and twice she's kicked my ass without even tensing a muscle.
And I haven't been able to figure out what she is or anything about her, except she wants the Key, which I have, and I don't even know if it's OK to tell anyone that.
No one could have done better than you.
But no one else is gonna be asked the questions that I can't answer.
They're gonna expect me to be like a slayer, and know stuff, but I'm just me and I don't know anything.
They'll go away and not tell me howto fight Glory and I won't be able to protect Dawn!
Buffy, calm down.
The scandal here is not anything you've done wrong.
It's the way they're behaving.
Holding what they know hostage with a gun pointed at my bleeding green card, no less.
It's humiliating.
Also smart.
They picked the perfect thing.
I can't lose you.
Thank you.
I guess I should be getting ready.
What do you think it'll be like?
How do you thinkthey'll start?
Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins.
And don't thinkthere weren't jokes about that.
"Who's our little patriot"?
they'd say, when I was younger, and therefore smaller and shorter than I am now.
So, you spell itA-N-Y-A, then?
- Yes.
- Fine.
Now we can get to the questions.
- Questions, great.
- We can answer questions.
Well, I need to know a little bit more about the Slayer, and about the both of you, your relationship, whatever you can tell me.
Our relationship?
- We're friends.
- Good friends.
- Girlfriends, actually.
- Yes, we're girlfriends.
We're in love.
We're lovers.
We're lesbian, gay-type lovers.
I meantyour relationship with the Slayer.
Just good friends.
Best friends.
Willow and me and Buffy.
The three of us were together from the beginning.
We've always gone on patrols, and done demon research with her and everything.
Have you mastered any fighting disciplines over the years?
No.
So, you have no special skills or powers or knowledge thatyou bring to the mix.
- Neither of you.
- Just enthusiasm for killing the demons.
Go deadness for the demons.
- I don't have any powers, but I do help.
- How?
Be specific.
Lastyear, Willow, Giles and me combined our essence with Buffy.
Which isn't as weird as it sounds.
We merged, and I was the heart part of a super-Buffy.
- Again, let me stress the not-as-weird thing.
- I'm told it was all very professional.
Are you saying that the Slayer needs that level of help from you often?
- No, no, she doesn't need help.
- She'd be fine without us.
She goes off and does stuff without even telling us.
Not that she's, like, a weird loner or anything.
- I'm not sure we're saying this right.
- See, here's the thing.
We can help because we do magics.
I'm working on this ball-of-sunshine thing.
- I have this theory.
- It's very cool.
And if it works, easier slaying for Buffy.
Not that it's hard for her now.
Interesting.
What level are you at?
"Level"?
Magical proficiency level?
A high level.
Very high.
One of those top levels.
Five!
And you're registered as practising witches under the names as you gave them to me?
"Registered"?
- Yes!
Yes, of course, we're - Registered.
Do either of you know anything about the Key?
Nope.
Sounds demony to me.
I don't hold with that demon nonsense.
Muffin?
I cooked them myself.
So, Buffy sometimes protects you from the dangerous elements of her work.
Yes.
She's saved my life lots of times.
The vampires in this town hate her.
But we understand thatyou help the Slayer.
- I pitch in when she pays me.
- She pays you?
She gives you money?
Money, a nip of blood out of some stray victim, whatever.
- Blood?
- Well, if they're gonna die anyway.
Come to think of it, that's a bit scandalous, isn't it?
I'm shocked.
The girl's slipping.
- You've noticed a decline in her work?
- Yeah.
See, the poor little twig can't keep a man.
Gets her all down.
Few more disappointments, she'll be crying on my shoulder, mark my words.
Is that whatyou want?
I'd think you'd want to kill her.
You've killed slayers before.
Heard of me, have you?
I wrote my thesis on you.
Well, well.
Ain't that neat?
Tell me, pet, now we're such good friends, how's the Slayer doing?
She OK?
High marks in all categories?
Agility, clarity, stamina and strength.
These are the qualities that the Slayer must possess to do her job.
- What came after agility?
- If you want her to attackthe dummy Phillip will attackthe dummy.
The Slayer's job is to protect it.
- Do you understand?
- Protect the dummy?
As if it were precious.
Now, getting the best of Phillip will require agility.
Listening to my instructions at the same time, that will demonstrate clarity.
And stamina and strength will win the long fight.
- Good luck.
- "Instructions"?
I'll be telling you what to do, howto counter Phillip's thrusts.
We assume you're familiar with the Japanese names for aikido and jiujitsu moves.
- Japanese?
- And go!
Hold on a second.
In America, we usually work our way up to "go".
He wants you to bow.
Take a bow.
- Punch him.
- Thanks, Giles.
Sorry.
Back kick, elbow Elbow strike.
- How've you been training her?
- I trained her to win.
Know what?
I'm gonna have to do it my way, guys.
- I think she just broke my rib.
- Yes, well I didn't mean to.
You know, I can do better.
I think I might be getting this, like, inner-ear thing.
Maybe if I got a note, I could try again?
No, that's all right.
I don't think we need to see any more physical tests for a while.
We can move on to the real review.
Look into your strategies.
Plans.
Figure out what's going on in that head.
Good.
Head stuff.
We start at seven tonight.
Give you time to Well, however you prepare.
Mom?
Long day, sweetie?
So this is where the Slayer eats, sleeps and combs her hair?
So cute.
I can't even stand it.
Personally, I need more space, but this is good for you.
It's so quaint, and Buffy, if I wanted to fight, you could tell by the being dead already.
- So play nice, little girl.
- What do you want?
The Key.
Why else do you think I'd come here?
See, I think you know where it is.
- And that's a good thing.
- I'm glad you think so.
It's the only thing keeping you alive right now.
You may be tiny queen in vampire world, but to me, you're a bug.
You should get down on your knees and worship me!
But no.
You still think it's neat having slayer strength.
Big deal!
Stronger than humans!
Who isn't?
I could crush the life from you as easy as you'd break a nail.
But I need the Key.
Kid!
- Come here a sec.
- Leave her out of this.
- Not asking twice.
- This is between you and me.
No.
This is between me and my Key.
You just happen to be the thing in the way.
And you are just the darlingest thing I ever did see in my life.
- What's your name, honey?
- Dawn.
Dawn?
Did you know your sister took my Key, Dawnie?
And she won't give it back.
- I betyou know where she put it, don'tyou?
- She doesn't know anything.
I know some stuff.
I bet she takes your stuff all the time without asking, doesn't she?
Where's my Key, Dawn?
Go upstairs, Dawn.
You're always talking about stuff I'm not supposed to hear.
I'm gonna figure it out, you know.
I like her.
She's sassy!
And I'll kill her.
I'll kill your mom, I'll kill your friends and I'll make you watch when I do.
Just give me the Key.
You either have it or you know where to find it.
Obviously, this is a one-time-only deal.
Next time we meet, something you love dies bloody.
You know you can't take me.
You know you can't stop me.
Buffy, who was that?
Pack a bag.
It's the Slayer.
For a second there I was worried.
So, what's with the family outing?
- I need your help.
- Great.
I need your cash.
I'm serious.
You have to look after them.
That's a boatload of manly responsibility to come out of nowhere.
What's the matter?
- You're not feeling 100 per cent?
- No.
- They didn't put a chip in your head?
- No!
- Be funny if they did.
- Spike, I need an answer.
Now.
In or out?
You're the only one strong enough to protect them.
All right, then.
Ladies, come on in.
There's plenty of blood in the fridge.
Do you mean, like, real blood?
- What do you think?
- Mostly I think "Ew".
Keep Dawn here as long as you can.
I'll be back soon.
- I don't need to remind you - Yeah, yeah.
"Anything happens to 'em, I stake you good and proper".
Sing me a new one sometime.
That bit's gone stale.
I love whatyou've neglected to do with the place.
Just don't break anything.
And don't make a lot of noise.
Passions is coming on.
Passions?
Do you think Timmy's really dead?
No, no, she can just sew him backtogether.
He's a doll, for God's sake.
What about the wedding?
I mean, there's no way they're gonna go through with that.
Look at them.
Big tough Council members picking on the books.
- Fascists.
- Why doesn't Mr Giles put them out of here?
If they deport him, they're not just destroying his career, they're condemning the man to a lifetime diet of blood sausage, bangers and mash.
Well, your slayer's 20 minutes late and counting, Rupert.
Buffy will be here, I assure you.
Yes, but when?
Crap!
Guys?
Any way we could not do this?
OK.
Let's see whatyou are.
- Or who you are.
- One soldier in a vast army.
What army?
The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order.
And now your enemy.
- You work for Glory?
- You think we ally ourselves with the Beast?
- You must be mad.
- You're the ones who tried killing me.
We were fools, three alone.
But if it takes a hundred men, we send a hundred men.
- If it takes a thousand, we send a thousand.
- A thousand?
So long as you protect the Key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you.
You are the Slayer, and we know what we must do.
Now, be done with it.
Kill us, and let legions follow.
Go.
- You're late.
- Yeah.
- Was there an attack?
- Yeah.
We can begin the review at last.
We'll skip the more obvious questions.
- There isn't gonna be a review.
- Sorry?
No review.
No interrogation.
No questions you know I can't answer.
No hoops, no jumps.
And no interruptions.
See, I've had a lot of people talking at me in the last few days.
Everyone just lining up to tell me how unimportant I am.
And I finally figured out why.
Power.
I have it.
They don't.
This bothers them.
Glory came to my home today.
- Buffy, are you?
- Just to talk.
She told me I'm a bug, I'm a flea, she could squash me in a second.
Only she didn't.
She came into my home, and we talked.
We had what in her warped brain probably passes for a civilised conversation.
Why?
Because she needs something from me.
Because I have power over her.
You didn't come all this way to determine whether I was good enough to be let back in.
You came to beg me to let you back in.
To give your jobs, your lives, some semblance of meaning.
This is beyond insolence I'm fairly certain I said "no interruptions".
That was excellent.
You're watchers.
Without a slayer, you're pretty much just watching Masterpiece Theatre.
You can't stop Glory.
You can't do anything with the information you have, except maybe publish it in the Everyone Thinks We're Insanos Home Journal.
So here's how it's gonna work.
You're gonna tell me everything you know.
Then you're gonna go away.
You'll contact me if and when you have any further information about Glory.
The shop will remain open.
Mr Giles will stay here as my watcher, reinstated at full salary.
Retroactive.
To be paid retroactively from the month he was fired.
I will continue my work with the help of my friends.
I don't want a sword thrown at me, but civilians?
We're talking about children.
We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.
Willow's a demon?
The boy?
No power there.
"The boy" has clocked more field time than all of you combined.
He's part of the unit.
- That's Riley-speak.
- I've clocked field time.
Now you all may be very good atyour jobs.
The only way we're gonna find out is if you work with me.
You can all take your time thinking about that.
But I want an answer right nowfrom Quentin, cos I think he's understanding me.
Your terms are acceptable.
See?
No begging.
- Rupert?
- Quentin?
When we inventoried your shop, we found a bottle of single-malt scotch behind the incense holders - It's not, you know, during working hours - I think I could use a glass.
- Well, I suppose we could - Just a minute.
Glory.
I wanna know.
Well, there's a lot to go through.
Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
Well, that's the thing, you see.
Glory isn't a demon.
What is she?
She's a god.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.
Dawn?
Did you know your sister took my Key?
And she won't give it back.
- I betyou know where she put it.
- She doesn't know.
OK, let's see who you are.
The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order.
And now your enemy.
So long as you protect the Key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you.
Look atyou.
All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
- Because you are.
- Well yeah.
- Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
- Glory isn't a demon.
- What is she?
- She's a god.
Mom wants to make with the merry tomorrow night, but with everything that's going on This is exactly whatyou need: a 20th-birthday party with presents, and funny hats, and those candles that don't blow out.
- Those used to scare me.
- Me too.
I don't thinkthis is the best time for the party piñata.
We need to stay focused to stop Glory.
We're goin' up against a god, an actual mightier-than-thou god.
- Well, the bigger they are - The faster they stomp you into nothing.
She's right.
I've thrown everything I've got at her.
She just shrugs it off.
- Then find something heavier to throw.
- That might pose some difficulty.
From what the Council's discovered from the Book of Tarnis and other sources, Glory and two fellow Hell gods ruled over one of the more seriously unpleasant demon dimensions.
- There's more than one?
- There are thousands.
All different.
All pushing at our reality, trying to find a way in.
I guess Glory found one.
The question is, why?
There's nothing to indicate that here.
Just vague references to chaos and destruction.
OK, so we know where Glory's from.
What do we know about her?
She's tough, but no bolts of lightning, no blasts of fire.
- Shouldn't a god be able to do that?
- Usually, yes.
But being in human form must be severely limiting her powers.
No, all we have to worry about right now is she's immortal, invulnerable and insane.
A crazy Hell god?
And the fun just keeps on leavin'.
From what I can gather, her living in this world is seriously affecting her mental state.
She's only been able to keep her mind intact by extracting energy from us.
Well, from the human brain.
She's a brain-sucker?
She "absorbs the energies that bind the human mind into a cohesive whole".
- Once drained, all that's left is - Crazy people.
Which is why there's been an increase in the ranks of the mentally unstable in Sunnydale.
At least vampires just kill you.
We have to find a way to stop her.
Well, Tara and I can work on some tactical spells.
I can do some research.
I know way more about demon dimensions than Giles does.
Well, I do.
This is great long-term-planny stuff, but what about this Key thingy Glory's lookin' for?
Yeah.
Shouldn't we try to find it before she does?
I don't think we should worry about that.
They've got a point.
Whatever Glory's planning on opening with the Key, I'm guessing it won't be filled with candy and flowers.
So where should we look?
Do we know where it used to be kept?
Who saw it last?
We did.
Giles and me.
We know where it is.
- You what?
- You know, and you didn't tell us?
There were reasons.
Look, if Glory knewthat you guys knew where it was I didn't wanna putyou in that kind of danger.
As opposed to the other kind we're always in?
- You should've said something.
- Will, there You're right.
- It's time.
- Are you sure?
They'll be risking their lives.
They deserve to know.
Know what?
There's something thatyou need to know about Dawn.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.
The Key is the link.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.
The Key is the link.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.
You really think He is going to help you?
I fear your faith is gravely misplaced.
Shall we testyour faith now?
Never send a minion to do a god's work.
Hey, nice sword.
Bet it hurts.
- You guys doin' a spell?
- Dawn, hey.
Yeah, we're doing an early-warning incantation.
If anything Hell-godishly powerful comes within 100ft of the shop, then screechy siren things will, you know, screech.
This should give us a heads-up so we can hide the Key.
We already put one up around your house.
Cool.
Can I help?
I don't think Buffy would like the black arts bumpin' auras with the littlest Summers.
Yeah.
Whatever.
How can she not be real?
She's real.
She's just kinda new.
Hey.
We on the case?
Yeah.
Right on top, perched, ready for action.
How's my sweet fancy Dawn doin'?
Fine.
What's up with you?
Did you get into the sugar again?
You make a very pretty little girl.
- Anya, you wanna help me with that thing?
- Xander needs help with his thing!
I'm not sure our regular workout is challenging you any more.
- Perhaps we should make it harder.
- You always think harder is better.
Maybe next time I patrol I should carry a load of bricks and use a stake made of butter.
Very amusing.
I'm sure Dawn feels that way about her schoolwork sometimes.
That true?
How was school today?
The usual: big square building filled with boredom and despair.
Just how I remember it.
So, what's the homework sitch?
We imagine what we'll be like in ten years and write a letter to our future self.
The teacher's so out of ideas.
Wanna help?
Maybe later.
I have some stuff I have to do first.
- About the weird girl that came to the house?
- Glory.
And no, it's not.
Like you'd tell me anyway.
Dawn's too young and too delicate.
Right.
A young, delicate pain in my butt.
I think you're freakin' out cos you have to fight someone prettier.
That's the case, right?
Glory is evil and powerful.
And in no way prettier than me.
I think you're getting soft in your advanced age.
She didn't lookthat tough to me.
OK.
One more time.
Just between me and you, our itsy-bitsy little secret.
Where is the Key?
Even if I knew, I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
Well, you won't need a thousand, sweetie.
I'll make the first one last.
Long time.
What is it with you religious types?
It's intimacy, isn't it?
You're just scared of letting someone in!
It's OK.
I know how difficult the first time can be.
You don't have to be afraid.
Just relax.
You may not have the info I want butyou still got somethin' I need.
- Prezzies!
- See?
Just whatyou needed.
You are very, very wise.
Now gimme, gimme, gimme.
This is extremely suspenseful.
I want the presents.
It's beautiful.
Thank you, guys.
We thoughtyou'd get crossbows and killy stuff.
So we figured, less killy, more frilly.
It's just so lovely!
Oh, I wish it was mine!
Like you weren't all thinking the same thing.
I'm fairly certain I wasn't.
I've got one just like it.
Here.
Open mine.
It's not gonna explode, is it?
It's when we visited Dad that summer in San Diego.
I put the shells on it myself.
We picked them off the beach.
I remember.
Well, jeez, don't get all movie-of-the-week.
I was just too cheap to buy you a real present.
Thank you.
It still seems there's a lotyou don't know about this.
I mean, is she dangerous?
No.
I assume you're talking about her existence rather than her intentions?
Exactly.
Dawn?
What are you doing in there?
Party getting slow?
We need plates.
It's cake time.
Why does everybody act all weird when I'm around?
Me?
Me not weird.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you're talking about me.
- No.
No, we really weren't.
- We were talking about sex.
They were talking about me, like everybody.
Again, not so much.
In fact, none.
We were talking about sex.
You know us - sometimes we like to pretend stuff.
- Anya - Like, there's a fireman, or a shepherd You know what?
Let's not have this exchange of images now.
Oh, right.
Of course.
Can't let Dawn hear anything.
Fine.
I'm just gonna go to bed.
That way, I won't accidentally get exposed to words.
Cake?
- Jeez!
Lurk much?
- I wasn't lurkin'.
I was standin' about.
It's a whole different vibe.
What is Are you giving Buffy a birthday present?
Oh, my God.
Weird.
And chocolates?
Lame.
And the box is all bent.
And, well, you know she'd never touch anything from you anyway.
Shouldn'tyou be tucked away in your beddy-bye?
All warm and safe where nothing can eatyou?
Is that supposed to scare me?
- Little tremble wouldn't hurt.
- Sorry, it's just Come on, I'm badder than you.
- Are not!
- Am too.
You're in the bushes hugging a bent box of chocolates, and I'm What?
Sneaking out to braid hair and watch Teletubbies with your mates?
No.
I'm breaking into the magic shop.
To steal things.
Magic shop, eh?
All number of beasties between here and there.
Bet they'd really go for a Little Red Riding Hood like you.
That wouldn't sit too well with big sister.
I can take care of myself.
- You wanna come steal some stuff?
- Yeah, all right.
- Do you know howto do that or not?
- Give us a sec.
I usually just burst through doors.
That's right!
Who's bad now?
Girl with a mission, eh?
What's the caper?
Jewels?
Ancient artefacts?
Or just plain hard cash liberated from the till?
A book.
All this for a book?
I don't want the book, just what's inside.
I think it was Giles's notes.
He was standing here, and when I turned around it was gone.
Where did he learn to write so bloody small?
From a fruit fly?
Wait.
Here's something.
"Tarnis, 12th century".
"One of the founders of the Monks of the Order of Dagon".
"Their sole purpose appears to have been as protectors of the Key".
Brown-robe types always protect something.
It's the only way they can justify giving up girls.
Troll hammer.
Didn't go with my stuff anyway.
"The Key is not directly described in any literature, but all research indicates an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional frequency beyond human perception".
"Only those outside reality can see the Key's true nature".
"Outside reality".
What's that mean?
Second-sight blokes, mostly.
Or even justyour run-of-the-mill lunatics.
You don't belong here.
- There!
There's no one in there.
- I know whatyou are.
What else does it say about this Key?
Is it made out of gold?
Maybe we can hock it, split the take.
"The Key is also susceptible to necromanced animal detection, particularly those of canine or serpent construct".
"The monks possessed the ability to transform energy, bend reality".
Blah, blah, blah.
Good Lord, Giles writes as dull as he talks, doesn't he?
"They started work, but the Council has suggested to us that they were interrupted".
"Presumably by Glory".
"They obviously did manage to accomplish the taste" "accomplish the task".
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the Key to her in human form".
"In the form of a sister".
I guess that's you, niblet.
- Not even a card, huh?
- I wasn't really expecting one.
No contact with civilians.
There's probably a code name for it.
You know, like "radio silence".
It's "greeting-card silence".
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's time to start a newtradition: birthdays without boyfriends.
It could be just as much fun.
- Preachin' to the choir here, baby.
- Yeah.
Some of my best Oh, my God.
Is this blood?
- Dawn!
- Oh, baby.
- What did you do?
- This is blood, isn't it?
It can't be me.
I'm not a key.
- I'm not a thing.
- Oh, sweetie, no.
What is this all about?
What am I?
Am I real?
Am I anything?
- If you need anything - Thanks.
Perhaps I should stay.
You know, just in case.
This is a family thing.
We should deal with this.
OK.
Why didn'tyou tell me?
We were going to.
I just We thought it would be better if we waited until you were older.
- How old am I now?
- You're 14, sweetheart.
You knowthat.
No.
The monks, when did When did Six months ago.
I've only been alive for six months, huh?
You've been alive a lot longer than that to us.
You don't knowthat.
You don't know anything.
I'm just a key, right?
Everything about me is made up.
Dawn Mom and I know what we feel.
I know I care aboutyou.
I knowthat I worry aboutyou.
You worry about me because you have to.
I'm your job.
Protect the Key, right?
I worry because my sister is cutting herself!
Yeah?
How do you know?
Maybe this is just another fake memory from my fake family.
Sweetheart.
- Get out.
- Dawn.
Get out, get out, get out!
We need answers, Giles.
We need to find out everything we can about the Key.
- What's it for, who created it - And why Glory has a girl-god jones for it.
This isn't about her.
It's about Dawn.
She deserves to know where she came from.
She needs to know, or it will eat away at her.
How did she find these?
How did she get in here in the Who's been using the Urn of Ishtar as an ashtray?
Morning, sunshine.
If you've come round for eggs and sausage, I'm fresh out.
Hey, careful!
These are wet.
How could you let her find out like that?
From books and papers?
You hate me that much?
I was just along for the ride.
Not like I knew she was mystical glowy Key thing.
Nobody keeps me in the bloody loop, do they?
- You could have stopped her.
- Oh, yeah, here it comes.
Something goes wrong in your life, blame Spike.
News flash, blondie.
If kid sis wants to grab a midnight stroll, she'll find a way sooner or later.
I just thought she'd be safer with Big Bad lookin' over her shoulder.
She shouldn't have found out like that.
You didn't think you could keep the truth from her for ever?
Maybe if you had been more honest with her, you wouldn't be trying to make yourself feel better with a round of Kick The Spike.
Honey?
You're gonna be late for school.
I'm not going.
Blobs of energy don't need an education.
You want me to make some soup?
I thinkthere's some chicken and stars.
I'm not sick!
- I'm not anything.
- Honey, calm down, OK?
Don't tell me what to do.
You're not my mother.
I changed my mind.
I'd rather be at school.
All right, fellas.
Today we've got blues, greens and Oh, hey, chartreuse.
It's a party.
It won't stick.
The birds have been pecking too hard.
- Byzantium.
- Yes, they've arrived.
Unfortunate, but not completely unexpected.
- How many?
- Their numbers are fewfor the moment.
But they'll grow.
The Knights of Byzantium are like ants: firstyou see one, then two then the picnic's ruined.
No matter how many we kill, they'll keep coming.
Wave after wave.
It's time to set old animosities aside.
Your fate is directly linked to Her Magnificently-Scented Glorificus.
She's been extremely forgiving of your considerable foibles up until now, but if you persist in your defiance, she'll be forced to To what?
What is she going to do?
Send a six-pack of minions to bore me to death?
Glory can't lay a finger on me.
You know it, I know it, she knows it.
So save the threats, or I'll finish the job I started on your head.
We can't just let her sit up there all alone.
She needs time.
We can't force her to be all right with this.
That's your answer?
Just leave her alone and hope that everything works itself out?
No.
But if I were her, I'd want a little bit of time right now.
I wouldn't want my mother and my sister coming at me from all sides.
Her school called today.
She was suspended.
She yelled at a teacher.
The things she said, Buffy.
She's never used language like that.
She probably feels like she can say or do anything right now.
She's not real.
We're not her family.
We don't even know what she is.
- How can you talk as if she's a thing?
- I'm not!
I'm just saying that's probably how she feels.
Then we have to show her that it isn't true.
She needs to know she's still a part of this family.
It's not that simple!
We're not gonna be able to fix this with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup.
Dawn needs to know where she came from.
She needs real answers.
What she needs is her sister, Buffy, not the Slayer.
The Slayer is the only thing standing between Dawn and this god from the bitch dimension that wants to shove her in a lock and give her a good twirl!
Mom, I need to be out there Oh, my God.
Glory.
It's Willow's spell.
Wait.
It's not Glory.
Damn it.
Dawn!
- Buffy.
- No!
She could've burned the house down!
Buffy, she's gone.
She tore up her room.
She burned all of her diaries.
The Dawnmeister Chronicles?
She's been keeping those since I mean Since she was seven.
I remember too, Will.
We have to find her.
Fast.
Before Glory or the Knights of Hack and Slash figure out what who she really is.
Mom will stay at home in case she shows up.
I figure we split up and sweep the city.
Anya, stay here in case she shows up.
Xander, Giles, take the centre of town.
Willow, Tara, west side.
Spike, you and I'll get the east side.
Just find her.
Please.
- Betyou can't push me all the way around!
- Oh, yes, I can!
No, you can't!
There are so many things I remember.
Seeing Dawn.
Hangin' with her.
Listening to Buffy complain about her.
Mostly that last one.
- How could all that never really happen?
- It takes some getting used to, the idea of a bright 14-year-old actually being living energy thousands of years old.
I'm guessing some kind of super-powerful in her rawform.
People have killed, died for it, summoned armies to control the Key.
You know, she kinda has a crush on me.
Your point being?
Oh, nothing, no.
Just sayin'.
Powerful being, big-energy gal digging the Xan-man.
Some guys are just cooler, you know?
Dawn!
- Dawn!
- That should do it.
- Shut up.
- She scampered off to get away from you.
She hears you bellowing, she'll pack it in the opposite direction.
Can't say I blame her.
You were right.
This is my fault.
I should've told her.
She probably would've skipped off anyway, even if she never found out.
She's not just a blob of energy.
She's also a 14-year-old hormone bomb.
Which one's screwing her up more right now, spin the bloody wheel.
You'll find her, just in the nick of time.
That's whatyou hero types do.
You'll find her.
And then what?
It's here.
It's here.
It's here.
Can't stop.
It's here.
It's here.
It's here.
It's here.
Make it stop.
The skin's too tight.
Can't hear it.
What's the frequency?
Empty.
All spilled out.
Please.
You see me, right?
- Look at me.
- Can't stop!
You know what I am, don'tyou?
You all know.
- Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't hear it - Tell me!
- Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't - What am I?
The Key.
I found it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank You know what the Key is?
Where did I come from?
Who made me?
What am I?
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Please!
- Destroyer!
Cracked earth and bones.
The sun bleeding into the sky!
The Key is the link.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.
Such is the will of God.
Such is the will of God.
Two cups of chocolate goodness, courtesy of whoever I swiped it from out of the cupboard.
Couldn't find marshmallows.
I'll try to steal some for next time.
- Don't like 'em anyway.
- What?
Is that even possible?
Too squishy.
When I was five, Buffy told me they were monkey brains and I Dawn, was your mom brought back in?
Is that why you're here?
No.
My mom's just fine.
- Is there anybody I can call?
Your sister?
- I don't have a sister.
You two have a fight?
It's OK, I know howthat goes.
I got a sister, too.
They can be a real pain sometimes, huh?
I tell you, there have been a lot of nights I wish she didn't exist either.
It's not Buffy.
It's me.
I'm the one that doesn't exist.
I know it feels that way sometimes, but when you're older No.
You don't understand.
- It's not real, none of this.
They made it.
- Dawn I'm nothing!
I'm just a thing the monks made so Glory couldn't find me.
I'm not real.
- You're the Key?
- How do you know about the Key?
Go!
Before she finds you.
Don't ask me how she knows, cos she always knows.
Just go.
- Calm down.
- You don't understand, you're a kid.
You stay, she'll find you.
She finds you, she'll hurtyou.
- What's wrong with you?
- You're what she's been searching for.
Run.
You don't know.
You Oh, no.
Oh, God, no.
She's coming.
I can feel it.
You've gotta get out.
No Oh, no, she's here!
She's here!
Hey, don't I know you?
Cotton!
Could a fabric be more annoyingly pedestrian?
Now, this is what I'm talkin' about.
Makes your skin sing.
You're You're Ben.
It's an eensy more complicated than that.
Family always is, isn't it?
You'd never make it.
I'd rip out your spine before you got half a step.
And those little legs?
They wouldn't be much good without one of those.
Would they, Dawnie?
Now, what I'm trying to noodle, is what in the world was the Slayer's little sis doin' here with Gentle Ben?
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?
You were talking to him, not me.
Oh, he wasn't being naughty, was he?
Excuse me, ma'am.
This area's for hospital personnel.
Rude.
I was talking.
What do you say we find a nice place off the beaten where you and I can have a long uninterrupted chat?
- We looked, but no Dawn.
- What about the carousel?
- Checked there, too.
- Nothing?
Sorry, Buff.
Anything could have happened to her.
Not just Glory.
I better checkthe hospital.
OK.
Small talk over.
I'm in a bit of a crunch, so let's cut right to the ooey-gooey centre.
Your sister, the Slayer, has my Key.
It's mine, I want it.
Do you know where she squirrelled it away?
There's ice cream and puppy dogs in it for you if you start singin'.
I'm not sure.
What does it look like?
Well, the last time I caught a peep it was a bright green swirly shimmer.
Really brought out the blue in my eyes.
But then those monks pulled an abracadabra, so it could be anything.
See my predicament?
Maybe.
Yes?
Well, maybe if you told me more about it I'd know if I've seen it.
OK.
- She wasn't brought in.
- Which is a happy thing, right?
- I don't know, I - in the break room.
You guys gotta see him.
His head's almost twisted clean off.
Glory.
So this Key thing it's been around for a long time?
Well, not as long as me, butyeah, just this side of for ever.
- Is it evil?
- Totally.
Well, no, not really.
I guess it depends on your point of view.
What's it for?
I mean if it's a key, there's gotta be a lock, right?
Yes.
We have a winner.
So what does it open?
I smell a fox in my hen house.
Is that why you were playing with Uncle Ben, to get a peek at Glory's unmentionables?
No.
I I kinda wanna hear me talking right now.
Me talking.
You know what I'm starting to think?
I'm thinking that maybe you don't have any idea where my Key is.
Very irritating, irrational.
You know what I mean, tiny snapdragon?
Like Like bugs under my skin.
And say I'm feeling a little What's wrong with you?
Hey, this doesn't have to be a complete waste of my precious time.
I've been meaning to send the Slayer a message.
And I could use a little pick-me-up.
Two birds, one stone, and boom!
You have yummy dead birds.
Get away from my sister.
- Hey, we were just talking aboutyou!
- Conversation's over, hell bitch.
I thoughtyou said this skank was tough.
If he wakes up, tell your boyfriend to watch his mouth.
He is not my boyfriend.
Hey, those are really nice shoes.
Giles, now!
Oh, please.
Like that's gonna Watch the hair.
Time to start the dying.
Start with the whelp.
Dawn!
- Buffy!
- Get back!
Nice catch.
Is that the best you crap-gnats can muster?
Cos I gotta tell you, so not impressed.
Look whatyou did to my dress, you little Discede!
Willow!
Dawn.
- What did you do to her?
- Teleportation spell.
- Still working out the kinks.
- Where'd you send her?
Don't know.
That's one of the kinks.
Oh, sh That was an incredibly dangerous spell for an adept atyour level.
Yep.
Won't be trying that one again soon.
Are you OK?
Did she hurtyou?
Why do you care?
Because I love you.
You're my sister.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Look, it's blood.
It's Summers blood.
It's just like mine.
It doesn't matter where you came from, or how you got here.
You are my sister.
There's no way you could annoy me so much if you weren't.
I was so scared.
Me too.
Come on.
Wait.
Ben.
He was here.
He was trying to help me.
He I I think he might have left before Glory came.
I can't remember.
It's OK.
Don't worry about it.
Next time we see him, we'll thank him.
I have to getyou back home, though.
Mom's freaking out.
Is she mad about the whole fire thing?
I think you sorta have a "Get Out of Jail Free" card on account of big love and trauma.
Really?
OK.
Good.
- You think she'd raise my allowance?
- Don't push it.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Look atyou.
- All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
- Because you are.
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it, so they sent the Key to her in the form of a sister".
- I'm not real.
- You're the Key.
Go!
Before she finds you.
Don't She's here!
Ben.
He was trying to help me.
He might have left before Glory came.
I can't remember.
§ I'm amused § By the overwhelming choices § I guess the hardest part § Is knowing when to stop § Yeah, I'm confused § And I think I'm hearing voices § Things are happening so fast § Do I save the best for last?
Bleeding crime is what it is.
Jacking up the bar price to pay for fixing up this sinkhole.
Not my fault the insurance doesn't cover "act of troll".
Gee, maybe it's time you found a new place to patronise.
I've half a mind to, since the flowering onion got remodelled right off the sodding menu.
It's the only thing this place had going for it.
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, "What am I"?
Here.
At this table.
Talking to me.
Like we're some kind of talking buddies.
Well, I saw you sitting here alone.
Thought, I don't know, you could, maybe do with a bit of, you know, company.
Suityourself.
Well we took on that Glory chippy together.
I was right there with you, fighting the fight.
Or sleeping the sleep of the knocked unconscious.
Still, points for intent.
You'd thinkthat would be enough to cut me a sliver of slack.
- Earn me a little consideration, respect.
- Hey, Evil Dead, you're in my seat.
Bugger it.
Xander, I think you hurt his feelings.
And you should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer.
You know, that's actually some pretty good advice.
Who's up for more liquid refreshments?
I'm buying, for I am Payday Man.
I could use a water.
Water poses no challenge for Payday Man, for I have Hey, where's my change?
Spike, you diabolical fiend.
Poor Will.
Still getting those headaches?
Fewer and further between, but they're still exercising their visitation rights.
Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first We have squat in the way of Glory-fighting arsenal.
Another run-in with her, and headaches and nosebleeds will be the least of our problems.
This is my first R and R in weeks.
Can we go one night without saying the name Glory?
I'm down with that.
Let's call She Who Will Not Be Named another name.
Let's call her - Ben!
- For example.
I'll be right back.
- Ben!
Hey!
- Buffy, hi.
I barely recognised you withoutyour hospital scrubs.
Oh, you'd be surprised at the extent of my wardrobe.
- Really?
- I have entire outfits that aren't blue pyjamas.
My sister told me what happened at the hospital before I got there.
- Uh-huh.
- And I just wanted to say thanks.
For looking after her.
That's OK.
I'm glad Dawn's all right.
- The point is, I work hard for that money.
- And you're saying I didn't?
- You stole it.
- And you're making it into very hard work.
Listen, Bleach Boy, I don't have a chip in my head.
I can do far more damage to you than you can ever do to me.
Yeah?
Like you could ever hurt me.
Sunnydale Station!
Last stop this line!
Oh, God!
Oh, please!
Help me!
Somebody, please!
Help me!
Buffy?
- I'm back by popular demand.
- Did you have a nice time?
You know, I think I did.
Much needed fun.
Apart from Willow's headaches and Spike's cameo appearance.
- Spike was there?
- Unfortunately.
Well, I'm relieved thatyou're home.
Because, to be honest, I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone.
At first.
And then I remembered that Rupert was here and I felt much, much safer.
Yes, well, thank you for the little back-pedal, but I'm forced to agree that I'm barely an adequate substitute for a slayer in the house.
Good night.
Good night.
- So how is Dawn?
- She's coping very well.
Extremely well, really, considering the extraordinary circumstances of her origin.
Then let me ask you something.
We've been going easy on her the last week, letting things slide.
- I don't thinkthat's at all wise.
- You don't?
The best thing you can do now is behave exactly as you always have.
Any special treatment at this stage will undermine Dawn's sense of normality.
- You think so?
- Absolutely.
Thanks.
Dawn!
- What?
- What did I say about borrowing my clothes?
- I didn't.
- Bull!
- I never touched your stuff.
- Then what happened to my blue sweater?
Spikey?
- Aren'tyou coming to bed?
- I'm not tired.
Me neither.
Don'tyou wanna come in and tire me out?
Harm, I'm really not in the mood right now.
You're never in the mood.
- We could do something different tonight.
- Like you stop yammering for two seconds?
Well, we could I don't know maybe play a game?
Oh, I'm gonna stake you!
I'm coming after you, you bad, evil vampire, and I'm gonna slay you!
I'm sneaking up, and I'm gonna stake you so much with my slaying powers that I have because I'm the Chosen Oh, Spike!
I don't see why he couldn't end up with Esmeralda.
They could have the wedding right there, beneath the very bell tower where he laboured thanklessly for all those years.
No, it can't end like that, cos Quasimodo's actions were selfishly motivated.
He had no moral compass, no understanding of right.
Everything he did was out of love for a woman who would never love him.
Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy ending when the main guy's all bumpy.
- What do you think, Buffy?
- The test isn't till tomorrow, right?
- I don't have an opinion till then.
- Butyou read it, right?
Kinda not.
I rented the movie.
Oh, with Charles Laughton?
- I dunno.
He one of the singing gargoyles?
- Oh, boy.
What?
I'm kidding!
- You're done with this?
- Yeah, hi, kind of reading that "Six found murdered on train at Sunnydale Station".
Glory?
"Unconfirmed reports of severe trauma to the throats of one or more of the victims".
Survey says vampire.
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here, lurking about?
I'm not lurking.
I'm looking.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
So is that how you get around town in the daytime?
I mean, does that lead into the sewers or something?
- Can you show me?
- No.
Why are you?
Does Buffy know you're here?
Yeah, right.
Nothing would make her happier than to find out I'm hanging out in a vampire's lair.
- Especially yours.
- Go home, then.
- I don't feel like it.
- You can't bloody well stay here.
- Why not?
- Because I've got things to do.
Bad, evil things!
That are not for a child's eyes.
I'm not a child.
I'm not even human.
Not originally.
Yeah, well, originally I was.
I got over it.
Doesn't seem to me it matters very much how you start out.
That's smart.
I get that.
I like how you talkto me like I can understand things.
Everyone else is being all twitchy and secretive.
They're just trying to keep you safe, I expect.
I feel safe with you.
- Take that back!
- I mean, you have the superpower thing.
You're just as tough as Buffy is, maybe tougher.
- Buffy thinks so too.
- She does?
Well, she's always worried about what she'll do if you ever get that chip out of your head.
Is that right?
So, what else does Buffy say about me?
- Hey!
- Dawn?
No, it's me.
- Is Dawn with you?
- Isn't she here?
No, she didn't come home from school.
The news said something about people murdered.
It's not Glory.
It has nothing to do with Dawn, I promise.
Look, she probably I'll find her.
And the lady just invited you in?
Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I?
Promised her he'd live if she did the invite.
And did you?
Let him live?
What do you think?
- Too much for you?
- No.
Keep going.
And I kill 'em.
Right quick, the whole lot.
But there's someone missing.
There's supposed to be this little girl.
So I get real quiet, and I hear this tiny noise coming from the coal bin.
This little sigh.
So I listened harder.
It's very, very quiet - Bloody hell!
- Spike, I need your help.
Dawn is here.
Spike was telling a story, and he was at this really cool part What the hell is this?
What is she doing here?
- Just hanging out.
- Here?
Can you please let him finish the story?
Then you could do the lecture?
Yeah.
OK.
Let's hear the story that Spike is telling my little sister.
Right.
Yeah.
So, I knewthe girl was in the coal bin, and rip it open, very violent, haul her out of there and then I give her to a good family in a nice home, where they're never ever mean to her, and didn't lock her in the coal bin.
What?
That's so lame!
I was just about to send her home.
I knew you'd be fretting.
Dawn, getyour stuff.
We're getting out of here.
Why doesn't that register with you?
Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
Cos it was Spike!
Hanging out with Spike is not cool, Dawn.
OK?
It is dangerous, and icky.
- I don't think Spike's icky.
- Yeah, well, think again, sister.
- You have a crush on him.
- No, I don't!
It's just, he's got cool hair, and he wears cool leather coats and stuff.
- And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
- He's a killer, Dawn.
You cannot have a crush on something that is dead, and evil, and a vampire.
Right, that's why you were never with Angel for three years.
Angel's different.
He has a soul.
Spike has a chip.
Same diff.
I can't listen to this!
Spike is a monster, OK?
And plus you are only 14 years old.
I like hanging out with him is all.
And even if I had a crush, he wouldn't notice in a million years.
Not with you around.
- What does that mean?
- Spike's totally into you.
Oh, come on.
You didn't notice?
Buffy, Spike's completely in love with you.
- So tell me again what we're looking for?
- Clues.
OK.
Could you give me a clue about what kind of clues?
Something.
Anything.
Just wanna know if this was a vamp attack.
And if it was, how many we're talking about.
Well, Sunnydale's finest didn't leave us a lot of stuff to examine, and who knows how many people have traipsed through here.
- Xander?
- What?
Never mind.
It's just that Dawn said that - Yeah?
- Forget it.
Buffy.
She thinks that She said that Spike's in love with me.
- I'm not joking.
- Oh, I hope not.
It's funnier if it's true.
I'm serious.
Xander, this is serious!
All right.
- It's creepy.
- No.
Not creepy.
Cos it's not real!
How upset can you get over one of Spike's fevered daydreams that's not gonna happen?
- I guess.
- So, where did Dawn?
How did she come to this extremely entertaining conclusion?
She was hanging out with Spike.
I think she has a crush on him.
- What?
- I knew he had a weird fixation with me I'm the one she has a crush on!
Me!
- There's nothing here.
Let's go.
- It's always been me!
Big funny Xander!
What, she just suddenly decides I'm not the cool one any more?
Why is that OK?
But what they didn't get was that it was a copy of the bill of lading.
So they thought it was another order form.
So now I've got two shipments of Greek amphorae on my hands!
That's funny.
And, really, how many do you need?
Amphorae?
Oh, Buffy.
Spike came by to apologise for yesterday.
Our missing-child drama.
And he just decided to hang out for a while?
Well, I got talking about the gallery.
See, there was this Don't get us all laughing again, Joyce.
Anyhow, I really need to talkto your eldest.
What about?
I got a bit of info you might be keen on knowing.
Sorry, all out of cash.
Why don'tyou hit on Giles hit up Giles?
I got a bead on the guy who killed those people.
The ones on the train.
- Do tell.
- I'll do better than that.
I'll show.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Just Two vamps holed up in a warehouse downtown.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Grab your coat and your pointy sticks.
Hey!
It's not blood, it's bourbon.
Suityourself.
§ I wanna be sedated Do you like the Ramones?
So if you're not doing this for the money, why are y?
Slayer.
Well that was sad.
I'm embarrassed for our kind.
So should we chase after 'em, then?
They couldn't have gone far.
These vamps have been here for a while.
They've nested.
So, you're saying they're a couple of poofters?
No.
I'm saying they had nothing to do with last night's murders.
How do you figure?
Whoever did it only arrived in town last night.
Looks like you've wasted my time.
What are you doing?
I wasn't thinking.
- What is this?
- Oh, don't getyour knickers twisted.
I was What is this?
The late-night stakeout?
The bogus suspects?
The flask?
- Is this a date?
- A d?
Please!
A date?
You are completely off your bird!
I mean Do you want it to be?
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's not so unusual.
Two people in the workplace - Feelings develop.
- No!
No.
No, feelings do not develop.
No feelings.
You can't deny it.
There's something between us.
Loathing.
Disgust.
Heat.
Desire.
- Please!
Spike, you're a vampire.
- Angel was a vampire.
- Angel was good.
- And I can be too.
I've changed, Buffy.
What, that chip in your head?
That's not change.
That's just holding you back.
You're like a serial killer in prison!
Women marry 'em all the time!
But I'm not like that.
Something's happening to me.
I can't stop thinking aboutyou.
And if that means turning my back on evil You don't know whatyou mean!
You don't know what feelings are!
I damn well do!
I lie awake every night!
- You sleep during the day!
- Yeah, but You are missing the point.
This is real here.
- I love - Don't!
Don't say it.
- I'm going.
- Oh, come on, we need to talk We don't need to do anything!
OK?
There is no "we"!
Understand?
Buffy Who's there?
A happy memory, pretty Spike.
Look who's come to make everything right again.
So, let me get this straight.
Darla got mojoed back from the beyond, you vamped her, and now she and you are working on turning Angel into his own bad self again.
- Sounds fun.
- It is.
Like lollipops at the circus.
Although didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.
And this has gotyou, what, all nostalgic now, has it?
I want us to be a family again, my William.
Come back with me.
To Los Angeles?
I've done the whole LA scene, Dru.
Didn't agree with me.
Besides, I've got a sweet little setup here in Sunny D. Decent digs not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.
Naughty.
You needn't make up stories.
I already know why you're not coming.
Poor boy.
Tin soldiers put funny little knick-knacks in your brain.
Can't hunt.
Can't hurt.
Can't kill.
You've got a chip.
Right, so you've heard.
Poor Spike's become a cautionary tale for vampires, right?
"You better be good, kiddies, or else they might wire you up someday"!
I don't believe in science.
All those bits and molecules no one's ever seen.
I trust eyes and heart alone.
And do you know what mine is singing out right now?
You're a killer.
Born to slash and bash and bleed, like beautiful poetry.
No little Tinkertoy could ever stop you from flowing.
Yeah.
But the pain Love, you don't understand.
It's searing.
It's blinding.
All in your head.
I can see it.
Little bit of plastic, spider-webbing out nasty blue shocks.
And every one is a lie.
Electricity lies, Spike.
It tells you you're not a bad dog, butyou are.
- What the heck is this?
- Oh, bloody hell.
Who is?
Oh, wait.
I get it.
Our little sex game was just the beginning.
Now you pick up some cheap queen of the damned to dress as your precious Droodzilla.
Harm You better not be thinking what I think you're thinking.
My answer is the same as always.
No threesomes unless it's boy, boy, girl.
Or Charlize Theron.
Harm, you moron, this is Drusilla.
Well.
You've got some nerve showing up here like this.
After all this time.
After breaking my sweet boo-boo's heart.
Do you have any idea how hard it's been to break down the walls he put up after you left?
- I mean, serious trust issues.
- Harm So it's no use crawling backto him, cos he don't play that game any more, Morticia.
It's been fun while it lasted, Harm, but I think it'd be best now if you hit the road.
Why?
Because she's back?
No.
Because I am.
And there you are, my darling, deadly boy.
Well, he actually told you?
He said "I love you"?
Well, I didn't let him get that far, but I could see the words coming.
Honey, did you somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way?
Send him signals?
Well, I do beat him up a lot.
For Spike that's like third base.
Buffy, I'm really worried.
So am I. He could become dangerous.
Not really.
As long as it's still chips ahoy in Spike's head, he can't hurt me, or any of us.
Besides, this'll probably just blow over.
You know?
It's just a weird Spike thing.
He'll have the hots for some gak demon before we know it.
I don't know.
These things can become pretty twisted.
- Yeah, and Spike, I mean, he's - Pretty twisted.
Yeah.
Well, you made it clear, right?
That it could never happen.
- That there's no possible way.
Ever.
- Yeah!
I think so.
I don't know.
I was just so thrown.
- Well, Buffy, you have to talkto him again.
- What?
No.
No, no, I have to avoid him again.
Not until you shut him down completely.
If he thinks there's even a little chance with you, there's no telling what he'll do.
§ And this time § I'm staying § To bury the trail thatyou left § You left § And if I was cold § Well, then you would § Stay inside me § Warm me § Here I stay I knowthis is hard, butyou made the right decision.
Better to nip this in the bud before - The bud nips me?
- Exactly.
If you want, Buffy, I can go with.
Back you up with some scowling.
Thanks, but I think this is something I have to do myself.
Besides, maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe this whole thing's just been blown way out of proportion and he's already gone back to wanting me dead.
Here's hoping.
You know what, though?
There is one thing you can do for me while I'm gone.
§ I told you § Just like I told everyone § I still have some doubts § Thatyou are the reason § Still this is just so hard § Cos I knowthat I'll be left § Like always § Always § Here I'm safe § So here I stay § Lift me out § Lift the doubt Spike?
Are you here?
Spike?
See anything interesting?
Spike I What - What happened?
- Me.
You remember my ex, don'tyou, Slayer?
Come back, she did.
Couldn't live without me.
My boy's been feeding again.
But I know what he really wants to eat.
Shall we tie her up?
Play with her a teensy bit first?
I'm through playing.
I like it when you're all dour and straight-to-business, like.
Bloody well through playing.
There she is.
I was beginning to think you'd sleep the night away.
Dru Drusilla?
Not nice to change the game in mid-play, Spike.
You've taken my chair and the music hasn't stopped.
Sorry, pet.
My house, my rules.
I think I shall be very cross with you when I'm free again.
- What's going on?
- Simple.
I'm gonna prove something.
I love you.
- Oh, my God.
- No, look at me.
I love you.
You're all I bloody think about.
Dream about.
You're in my gut, in my throat.
I'm drowning in you, Summers, I'm drowning in you.
I can do without the laugh track, Dru.
But it's so funny.
I knew before you did.
I knew you loved the Slayer.
The pixies in my head whispered it to me You can't tell me there isn't anything between you and me.
I know you feel something.
It's called revulsion.
And whatever you think you're feeling, it's not love.
You can't love without a soul.
Oh, we can, you know.
We can love quite well if not wisely.
You still don't believe.
You still don't think I mean it.
You want proof?
How's this?
I'm gonna kill Drusilla for you.
It doesn't prove anything.
Except thatyou're a sick vampire I should have dusted long ago.
- And hey, already there.
- Don't mockthis.
- Go mock yourself.
- This is Drusilla, girl!
Do you have the slightest idea what she means to me?
It's the face of my salvation!
She delivered me from mediocrity.
For over a century we cut a swath through continents.
A hundred years, she never stopped surprising me.
Never stopped taking me to new depths.
I was a lucky bloke.
Just to touch such a black beauty.
So you see, it means something.
Not to me.
Kill her.
Why do I care?
Here's why.
If you don't admit that there's something there some tiny feeling for me then I'll untie Dru and let her kill you instead.
Yes, please.
I like that game much more.
Just give me something.
A crumb.
The barest smidgen.
Tell me maybe, someday, there's a chance.
Spike The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
What the bleeding hell is wrong with you bloody women?
What the hell does it take?
Why do you bitches torture me?
- Which question shall I answer first?
- I'm at the end of my bleeding tether.
I don't even know why I even bother.
It's your fault.
You're the one to blame for all this.
- Am I?
- Bloody rightyou are!
If you hadn't left me for that chaos demon, I never would have come back here!
Never would have had a sodding chip in my skull!
And you wouldn't be able to touch me.
Because this, with you, is wrong.
I know it.
I'm not a complete idiot.
You think I like having you in here?
Destroying everything that was me, until all that's left is you, in a dead shell.
You say you hate it, butyou won't leave.
You know, what I should just do is get rid of both of you.
Burn you.
Cutyou into little pieces, so there won't be any more bints to cock up things for Spi - Oh, great.
- What about me, Spike?
You forget about me again?
The actual girlfriend?
I gave you the best bunch of months of my life!
That's right, little girl.
Teach our naughty boy a lesson.
- Oh, so now you're all ganging up?
- I thought I could change you, Spike.
I thought maybe if I gave and I gave and gave, maybe you'd come around.
Maybe be a little nicer.
Stop treating me like your dog.
But now I see it's you.
You're the dog, who needs to be put You're on my hair.
Poor Spike.
So lost.
Even I can't help you now.
Oh, Spikey.
And you can say goodbye to this.
Because you're not gonna see it any more.
Unless you run into me somewhere and it's me walking away from you.
But even then, I'll probably just, you know, back away.
Buffy?
Come on now, stop!
You can't just walk away from this.
- What part did you not understand?
- We had a fight.
It doesn't change anything.
It changes everything, Spike!
I wantyou out.
I wantyou out of this town, I wantyou off this planet!
You don't come near me, my friends or my family again, ever!
Understand?
No.
It's not that easy.
We have something, Buffy.
It's not pretty, but it's real.
And there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm in your life.
You can't just shut me out
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - What kind of demon am lfighting?
- Glory isn't a demon.
She's a god.
Tell me where the Key is.
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human.
- Sent it to you.
- Dawn.
I know you got a lot on your mind.
You wanna let me in on any of it, let me know.
Buffy's like nobody else in the world.
But she doesn't love me.
- They want me back.
- Are you going?
- I don't know.
If we can't workthis out - This is goodbye?
Riley!
There's something you need to know about Dawn.
Why does everybody act all weird when I'm around?
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it, so they sent the Key to her in the form of a sister".
- Is this blood?
- What did you do?
I'm not a key.
- I'm not real.
- You're the Key.
Go.
Before she finds you.
She's here!
I love you.
The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
I wantyou out.
I wantyou out of this town, I wantyou off this planet.
You don't come near me, my friends, or my family again, ever.
Understand?
Spike!
Spike wants me.
How obscene is that?
Well, it is very strange.
I can't imagine what he's thinking.
Not thatyou're not attractive I feel gross, you know, like, dirty.
That's ridiculous.
You can't be responsible for what Spike feels.
Aren't I responsible?
Something about me had to make him feel that, right?
Something that made him say "Woof!
That's the one for me"!
- I think you should perhaps calm down.
- Me too.
Puffy Xander, I'm sorry.
I guess I got carried away.
Are you OK?
I'm alive.
I can tell cos of the pain.
- Do you wanna sit down?
- I'm not that bendy.
I could lean.
I'll get some ice.
Here.
- Comfy?
- Yeah.
This leaning, this is the stuff.
That's my secret to attracting men.
It's simple really.
Slap 'em around, torture 'em, make their lives hell - Buff - Sure, the nice guys run away, but every now and then you meet a real prince of a guy like Spike who gets off on it.
Buffy.
Stand me up.
The problem is notyou.
Don't do this to yourself, please.
I just wanna know that there's gonna be another good one.
One that I won't chase away.
There will be.
Promise.
He's out there.
He can come along any minute.
And the minute after that I can terrify him with my strength and self-involvement.
What?
I don't think you're like that.
Maybe I could change.
You know, I could work harder.
I could spend less time slaying, and laugh at his jokes.
Men like that, the joke-laughing-at.
Or maybe you can just be Buffy, he'll see your amazing heart, and fall in love with you.
Xander, that's This is the day you choose to hug me?
Buffy?
You ever think you haven't found a great relationship on the Hellmouth because it's a Hellmouth?
Seems to me it's a pretty terrible place to try to build anything.
Thank you for picking me up.
I'm grateful for the ride.
You sure you wanna get out here?
I mean, this place is kinda What are you looking for in Sunnydale, anyway?
True love.
I might like it more than the others.
Can you spin around again?
I'm not sure.
Once more.
Now could you go the other way?
You're messing with me.
- We were seeing how many times you'd do it.
- Was it five, or four and a half?
- So is anyone gonna talk about my dress?
- I like it.
You sure?
I mean, it's not too mom-ish?
- That was why I liked it.
- You're both crazy.
It's not mom-ish at all.
It's sexy.
It screams "Randy sex kitten.
Buy me one drink and I'll" Wait, that's not good either.
Oh, God.
What time is it?
Vast acres of time, in which you could plant crops.
Tell me about Brian and his intentions.
- Maybe he's a gigolo.
Was his shirt all shiny?
- No.
He works for a publishing house.
He's a nice, normal guy, OK?
- I think I've heard of those.
- He came to the gallery, my first day back, when I was, you know, kinda shaky, starting over.
And he asked a question about these antique cameos, and I was so lost, because Carol had been doing the ordering while I was sick.
It turned out he didn't know anything about them either, so we had a lot to talk about.
- So what's the plan for tonight?
- Dinner and then a movie.
Or maybe it was a movie and then dinner.
Which might be better, because, you know, then we could talk about the movie.
Or maybe a movie isn't a good idea at all, because you can't talk during, and then, you know, what's the point of any of it?
And about the restaurant.
Do you think it should be one with candles and romantic music, or is that pushing it?
What do you think?
Should I try to make things romantic, or let him set the pace?
No.
Love Doctor Buffy is not in.
I'm not qualified to give dating advice.
I've had exactly two boyfriends, and they both left.
Really left.
"Left town" left.
Honey, you just had some bad luck.
You're going to that party.
Maybe you'll find someone there.
Or maybe Brian has a son, and Mom and I can go on unspeakably awkward double dates.
Oh, God Brian.
What time is it now?
- You sure the dress is OK?
- Spin again.
Real fast this time.
Willow's good with computers, but me not so much.
Do you really understand all that?
At first it was confusing.
Just the idea of computers was, like, "Whoa, I'm 1100 years old".
I had trouble adjusting to the idea of Lutherans.
I go online sometimes, but everyone's spelling is really bad.
It's depressing.
Butyou have to try online trading, it's great.
The secret is avoiding the tech companies everyone was jumping on, and going with the smaller firms that supply the basic components.
Anyway, I tookthe money from working for Giles, and I tripled it.
Tripled?
Like, first money, then money money money?
Yes.
I'm thinking about buying something very expensive.
Maybe an antelope.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you know where Warren is?
- And if you do, could you tell me?
- I don't think we know a Warren.
Well, all righty.
No harm in asking.
Thanks.
- Hi, do you know Warren?
I need to find him.
- Sorry.
You can do all this stuff with a regular computer?
I'll show you.
You can also see the website I designed for the shop.
Huge photo of me.
- How ya doin'?
Havin' o' the fun?
- You know, I am.
Dancing with you is better than trying to hook up with some good-looking guy.
I think I liked it better when you were kicking me in my puffy groin.
I let them do that.
Dance together.
That was me.
- Very nice of you.
- A good deed.
Yes.
I'm expecting a big karmic reward any second now.
Thank you.
Buffy.
Ben.
Hey.
I didn't even know you were here.
And again with the nonmedical clothing.
Actually, these are orthopaedic pants.
Man, that sounded so funny in my head.
It's very, very funny.
It's funny in my head, too.
- Havin' a good time?
- Yeah, I am.
I was dancing earlier, and my friends are here, so But not that it's all about me.
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I am now.
So, do you maybe wanna dance?
I'm not really good at rhythm.
Sure.
I'd love to.
- Let me just dump this.
I'll be right back.
- OK.
Look at these tiny grain patties.
They're woven.
That's craftsmanship.
They aren't handwoven, you know.
- Then how?
- Well, it's a machine, and it sorta it presses.
And there may be a mould of some sort Who's that?
Warren?
That girl.
Tara and I met her.
She speaks with a strange evenness and selects her words too precisely.
Well, some of us like that kind of thing in a girl.
Warren?
- Did you get me a drink?
- Gotta go, she'll see me.
- She who?
What's up, Warren?
- It doesn't matter.
Come on.
- Is Warren here?
- Thoughtyou were gettin' the crunchies.
Xander got hypnotised by the strange girl.
I am remaining calm, however.
No, I'm right with you.
You don't know whatyou're talking about.
Here she comes.
- I heard Warren was here.
Is Warren here?
- Warren who?
He's Warren.
And he's looking for me.
He lost me.
- Is Warren here?
- It's that girl again.
Is she still looking for Warren?
Weird, it's been, like, all day.
There's something strange about her.
She talks funny.
Some men find that appealing.
- Have you guys seen Warren?
- Let's hope she finds him.
I don't think a girl that looks like that'll be lonely for long.
Definitely not.
Not me.
I was just saying, a pretty girl like that, there's always someone lurkin' around, lookin' for some action.
Small world.
Oh, dear.
If looks could stake.
You havin' fun, pet?
Trollin' for your next ex?
I gotta say, you could do better.
- I told you, I wa - Thought I was gonna leave town?
It's a free country.
Free party.
If you want me to leave, you can putyour hands on my hot, tight body and make me.
Get away from me.
Was that guy botherin' you?
Should I offer to get inappropriately violent or somethin'?
- No.
- Good, cos, honestly, I don't wanna.
So, are you ready to dance?
- First - What's that?
Oh, yeah, my phone number.
I was gonna try to subtly work it into the conversation, but it didn't pan out, and I thought I should try to give it to you before you see me dance.
You know, in case you wanna get coffee.
Thank you.
I just I think you should know that I kinda have this bad history in which, you know, we go get coffee, and it all ends with you leaving town, and you just got here and everything Apparently we'd be riskin' a tragic chain reaction, but I just really like coffee.
I think coffee might be worth it.
And I would like to get to know coffee better.
Then I'll call you.
- Have you seen Warren?
- No, sorry.
And who are you, darlin'?
I'm April.
- I'm looking for my fella.
- Maybe you just found him.
Really?
Where?
That would be wrong!
You are not my boyfriend!
Bloody hell!
You threw me through a window!
- What's that about?
- You cannot say that to me.
I have a boyfriend.
Warren is my boyfriend.
You know what?
My bleeding sympathies to Warren.
No one but Warren can touch me.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Maybe you and I could talk, you know, cos throwing Spike through a window, that's really good.
- But, you know, generally speaking - Do you know my boyfriend?
OK, I think you need to take a second and stop looking for your boyfriend.
I have to find him.
If I hurtyou just now, I am sorry.
And I hope thatyour boyfriend will take good care of you.
I dunno aboutyou, but I've had it with superstrong women who aren't me.
- At least she didn't do too much damage.
- Double-glazed glass ain't cheap.
And the jamb needs to be completely repaired.
Dear God, I'm the grown-up who sees the world through my job.
I'm like my uncle Dave, the plumber, and I must be shunned.
- OK.
- So, what do you guys think she is?
This may sound nuts, but I kinda got the impression she was a - Robot.
- Yeah, robot.
I was gonna say robot.
What do you think she wants?
- Warren, whoever that is.
- It must be the guy that built her.
It's an unusual name.
There's hardly any, except Warren Beatty and President Harding.
It's probably not either of them.
Can you track down this guy with only a first name?
Given enough time.
I can get a list of the Sunnydale students named Warren tonight, but then we'll have to call them or go to their dorms, so we probably can't start narrowing it down till tomorrow.
She could do a lot of damage by then.
To who, Spike?
See how vigorously I don't care.
It didn't sound like she wanted to hurt Warren.
She said he's her boyfriend.
I agree.
I'm not sure this is a code red.
Is there a code pink?
We need more codes.
OK.
We'll track down Warren tomorrow.
I'd better rescue Giles.
He's been watching Dawn while my mom's out on her date, and I thinkthere's only so much he can take.
Giles and Dawnie?
I bet they ended up having a blast.
Dear God, there's only so much I can take.
We'll have to change the system.
A 14-year-old's too old to be baby-sat, and it's not fair on her.
- What'd she make you do?
- We listened to aggressively cheerful music by people chosen for their ability to dance, we ate cookie dough and talked about boys.
I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sorry, but if it makes you feel any better, my "fun Buffy party night" involved watching a robot throw Spike through a window, so if you wanna trade No, wait.
- I won't give that memory up for anything.
- Robot?
Sounds interesting.
We're gonna work on it tomorrow.
Unless you wanna stay and Who wants to hear everything?
listen to my mom talk about boys.
- Must go.
See you tomorrow.
Bye, Joyce.
- Bye, Rupert.
Gosh, I'd forgotten how much fun dating can be.
I don't know.
I was right here.
I didn't see Prince Charming.
I didn't even see a good-night kiss.
It looked pretty tame to me.
I suppose by your standards it could seem pretty - Oh, dear.
- What?
I left my bra in his car.
- Mother!
- I'm joking.
- Good God, that's horrible.
Don't do that.
- I left it in the restaurant.
No more.
No more.
No more!
- On the dessert cart.
- I can't hear you.
Yeah?
What?
Hi.
Does Warren live here?
What the hell?
What are you doin'?
It's 3.30!
Yes, it is.
Does Warren live here?
OK, then.
Bye.
- You're certain she was a robot?
- Absolutely.
She practically had "Genuine Moulded Plastic" stamped on her ass.
Just tryin' a little spicy talk.
She was looking for someone named Warren.
- Will checked the Sunnydale enrolment.
- And got nothin'.
I found one Warren, but he left the country a year ago.
I'm checking nearby schools.
Whoever he is, he knows his stuff.
That girl, well That was a nice-lookin' girl.
It's OK for him to say that, cos I knowthat he really loves me only.
- Is there something we can be doing?
- What can we do?
- Do you have any books on robots?
- Yes, dozens.
There's a lot of research we should do No, I'm lying.
I haven't got squat.
I just like to see Xander squirm.
Funny.
Charming and funny.
I think I found him.
A Warren Meers.
He went to Sunnydale High with us for a semester, then he went to the tech college in Dutton.
I've got a local address where his folks live.
- He's probably home for spring break.
- I'll go talkto him.
No, wait.
We don't know whatyou're walking into.
We have no idea what his motive is for building this thing.
Don'tyou think she's just?
Yeah, she's just sort of a She's a sexbot.
I mean, what guy doesn't dream about that?
Beautiful girl with no other thought but to please you, willing to do anything Too many girls.
I miss Oz.
He'd get it.
He wouldn't say anything, but he'd get it.
Why would anyone do that if they could have a real person?
Maybe he couldn't - find a real person.
Come on.
The guy's just a big sleaze.
Don't make excuses for him.
I'm not.
I'm just saying people get lonely, and maybe having someone around, even someone you made up, maybe it's easier.
But it's so weird.
I mean, everyone wants a nice, normal person to share with.
But this guy, if he couldn't find that, I guess it's kinda sad.
- Hello?
- Hey.
Ben, it's Buffy.
Is this a bad time?
I know it's kinda early.
No, I just got in, is all.
Night shift at the hospital.
I'm glad you called.
I found your number and figured I'd pick up the phone a couple of times, then hang up, and then finally call, and see if you wanted to get that coffee, or Yeah.
Yes.
Coffee would be great.
Tomorrow night.
Sure.
Bye.
Fine.
We just got here.
Why didn't we just stay in Dutton?
Or we could've gone to my sister's.
I don't wanna hear aboutyour sister's again.
Pack your stuff.
Why the rush?
It's real early.
Are we even gonna say goodbye to your mom?
- You can call her.
- Is there something you're hiding from me?
Katrina, if you don't wanna pack, that's fine.
We can buy new stuff.
Now let's just go.
I have to talkto you.
- Who's this?
- Is this about her?
- Yes.
- Her who?
Something's going on here.
- Strange girls - Please, be quiet.
OK?
This is important.
- Wait in the kitchen.
- And I'm not important?
- Warren, just tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets.
Other girls, who knows what else.
Trina, shut up.
That's it.
Forget it, Warren.
I'm gone.
No.
Katrina!
We were at Sunnydale High together.
Do you know who I am?
Yes, I know.
April, did she hurt someone?
Notyet.
Well, no one that matters.
She's looking for me.
She followed me here.
- OK.
Kinda figured that out.
- No, there's more.
- There's something you need to know.
- I know.
- No, wait.
This is important.
- Believe me, I worked it out.
No, this is something thatyou can't possibly know.
She's a robot.
A robot?
Was it Ted?
Cos I always said there could've been more than one of him.
Nope, whole new robot.
This one was a girl.
Buffy's trackin' down the guy that made her, so I'll drop you off, and then Comin' through!
Comin' through.
Fire!
Fire!
Hello, all.
What's goin' on, then?
Spike, you're not welcome here.
Yeah, and we're working on a way to de-invite you from here.
Even if it is a public place.
Nah, forget it.
Letting him in is good, cos then we get to toss him out.
Can we throw him out the window like the robot did?
Cos that was neat.
Robot?
That's what she was?
I knew somethin' wasn't right.
Hey.
Someone's glad to see me.
Aren'tyou, little bit?
Stay away from me.
- I think you'd better go.
- OK.
Now, I was afraid of this.
Misrepresentations, misunderstandings, slurs and allegations.
I don't know what Buffy told you, but the thing is, the Slayer and I worked together to get rid of Dru, who was up to no good, and I don't - Spike.
Listen to me.
- It's just, I'm trying to explain.
She might have said some things that sounded like I expressed some kind of We are notyour friends.
We are notyour way to Buffy.
There is no way to Buffy.
Clear out of here.
And, Spike, this thing.
Get over it.
- I don't know whatyou mean.
- Yes, you do.
Move the hell on.
- I'm looking for my boyfriend Warren.
- What?
He comes from here and I need him.
But it's confusing, and I've already walked a really long way.
I'm sure he's nearby.
Warren.
You're lookin' for Warren?
Yes.
Do you know him?
Do you know where he is?
- Man, let me think - Please think.
Jeez!
This is too bad - you just missed him.
Yes?
Where did he go?
Warren?
He headed out.
That way.
Hurry, you might catch him.
Thank you.
I was getting very tired.
Thank you.
- Who's Warren?
- Hell if I know.
So you have girl troubles.
You're not gettin' dates.
You start thinking "This isn't fair".
I felt like I deserved to have someone.
Everyone deserves to have someone.
- So, naturally, you turned to manufacturing.
- Kinda.
- How long did it take to build your little toy?
- No, she's not a toy.
I know whatyou think, but she's more than that.
I'm sure she has many labour-saving attachments.
No, I made her to love me.
I mean, she cares about what I care about, and she wants to be with me.
She listens to me and supports me.
I didn't make a toy.
I made a girlfriend.
A girlfriend.
Are you saying?
Are you in love with her?
I really thought I would be.
I mean, she's perfect.
I don't know, I guess it was too easy, and predictable.
She got boring.
She was exactly what I wanted, and I didn't want her.
- I thought I was going crazy.
- Really?
You?
Then something happened.
Katrina was in my engineering seminar, and she was really funny and cool.
She was always giving me a hard time - real unpredictable.
She builds these little model monorails that run with magnets, and Anyway, I fell in love with Katrina.
Swell.
Romance and magnetic trains.
But firstyou decided to play with April for five minutes, and then what?
You got bored, decided to dump her, tell her to go away?
- Kinda.
- And she got mad.
She didn't go, huh?
OK.
I didn't really dump her, as much as I went out and didn't come back.
- I left her.
I left her in my dorm room.
- You left her in your dorm room?
I figured I'd just get away until her batteries gave up, which should've been days ago.
Did you even tell her?
Did you even give her a chance to fix what was wrong?
I didn't need to.
Her batteries were supposed to run down.
They should be dead by now.
- So why aren't they?
- I don't know.
I mean, maybe she must be recharging them somehow.
Warren, this is important.
Is she dangerous?
She's only programmed to be in love.
Then she's dangerous.
Do you have any idea howto find her?
She's looking for me.
My guess is she's pretty close.
Hi.
Do you know where Warren is?
I need to get to Warren.
This is getting insane.
How many of you are there?
There's only me.
April.
April.
Fine.
Listen up, April.
Warren is my boyfriend.
Mine.
And you others probably ought to figure that out.
- Let go.
- Don't go.
- You have to stay and tell the truth.
- What?
Stop!
You're lying.
He cannot be your boyfriend.
Say that he's my boyfriend.
I can't breathe.
Let go!
You have to stop lying.
All right, I'll move on.
April!
April, are you there?
- If she hears my voice, then she'll answer.
- She's voice-activated?
I made it so that if she heard me and didn't answer, it causes feedback.
If you call her and she doesn't answer, it hurts her?
You're one creepy little dweeb.
April!
Warren!
- April.
- Where have you been?
I couldn't find you, and this girl kept lying to me, and then she went to sleep.
April, what did you do?
Please don't be angry, Warren.
I'm trying very hard to make you happy.
April, I wantyou to put the girl down.
Warren?
What should I do?
- Talkto her.
- Put her down.
This is Buffy.
Give Katrina to Buffy.
Is she broken?
- She's alive.
- Thank God.
Warren, honey, what's going on?
Why did you go away?
Is it a game?
- No.
No, this isn't a game.
- Did I do something wrong?
I waited a long time and you never came back.
A long time.
- I made you five sweaters.
- Great.
Go and get them.
- You could wait there, and - Warren.
You have to tell her.
And do it right.
What is she saying, Warren?
What do you need to tell me?
April, I made a mistake.
- You can't make mistakes.
- No, I did.
I thought that I made you everything that I wanted, but it wasn't what I really wanted.
I'm sorry, but it's over.
But I can be whatever you want.
I love you.
I'll do whatever you want.
Like a neck rub?
No.
No.
See, I knowthatyou love me, but the truth is, I can't love you.
It's notyour fault, but I don't love you.
I love her.
She growls?
You made her so she growls?
Well - What's going on?
- No, no, Trina Get away.
What is?
That's a robot.
- She wasn't just for sex.
- Is thatyour ex-girlfriend?
- No, get the hell away from me!
- No, no.
Trina, no.
Trina, wait You took my man.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to I can't crush!
So tired.
Warren?
Where are you?
What's happening to me?
Can you cry?
Sometimes I feel better when I cry.
But there might be rust issues.
Crying is blackmail.
Good girlfriends don't cry.
I've rechecked everything.
I did everything I was supposed to do.
I was a good girlfriend.
I'm sure you were.
I'm only supposed to love him.
If I can't do that, what am I for?
What do I exist for?
I don't know.
It isn't fair.
He wasn't fair to you.
It's getting dark.
It's so early to be dark.
Yeah.
What if he comes back and he can't find me in the dark?
I'm here.
I'll make sure that he finds you.
Maybe this is a girlfriend test.
If I wait here patiently this time, he'll come back.
I'm sure he will.
And he'll tell you how sorry he is.
You know, he told me how proud he was of you and how impressed he was with how much you loved him and how you tried to help him.
He didn't mean to hurtyou.
He's going to take me home, and things will be right again.
They'll be fine.
When things are sad, you just have to be patient.
Because because every cloud has a silver lining.
And when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Clouds and lemonade, huh?
Yes.
And and things are always darkest before You construct the wood jamb and frame the glass into it, - and that's whatyou set into the opening.
- Yeah?
One of the cool things about that is the jamb can be shimmed to be square, even if the opening isn't.
Shimmed?
Is that even a real word?
Do you have any idea whatyou're talking about?
Yeah, I do.
Scary, isn't it?
I've turned into someone you want around after a crazed robot attack.
And if you ever startyour own business, you have your slogan right there.
And she wasn't crazed.
Yeah?
She devoted everything to making this one person happy.
And then it was, like, with him gone, there was just no reason for her to exist any more.
Robots are the strangest people.
No.
People are the strangest people.
I mean, look at me obsessing about being with someone.
It's like I don't need a guy right now.
I need me.
I need to get comfortable being alone with Buffy.
Well, I'll say this, she's a pretty cool person to be alone with.
Thank you.
Hi, it's Buffy.
I hope this is your machine.
There wasn't a message.
Anyway, about coffee.
I I just I don't thinkthis is the best time for me to be drinking coffee.
I'm sorry.
And bye.
- What the hell?
- If I may, Your Inconceivableness.
It sounds to these humble ears like our Ben tried to make a date with the Slayer.
A date with the Slayer?
No.
No.
No, no, no.
He is planning something, he's working against me.
She turned us down?
Trina?
No, wait.
Listen.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I guess I am s No, no, just give me a chance to explain.
I Yes.
No, but she No, no, listen, I'll do anything.
No, don't hang up!
- How did you get in here?
- Your mum let me in.
- I'm placing an order.
- I'm not making any more girls.
Sure you are.
And here's your specs.
You're gonna make her real good for me.
Hey, Mom!
Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
Hey!
Flower-gettin' lady!
Want me to pick Dawn up from school?
Mom?
What are you doin'?
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, Mom.
Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
Hey, flower-gettin' lady, want me to pick Dawn up from school?
Mom?
What are you doin'?
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy?
- I think we're about ready for pie.
- Then I'll be ready for barf.
- Xander!
- Gross!
No, no.
Barf from the eating.
Cos all was good, and too much goodness - I'm taking it as a compliment.
- Everything was delicious.
- Yes.
I'm going to barf, too.
- Everyone's so sweet.
- Will, you in the vomit club, too?
- I had too much nog.
Oh, baby, want me to rub your tummy?
She likes it when I stop explaining things.
My nog tastes funny.
I think I got one with rum.
That's bad.
Yeah.
Now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty booze hound.
Santa always passes me by.
Something puts him off.
Could be the big honkin' menorah.
- Did you write him a letter?
- What'd you ask for?
Guys, hello?
Puberty?
Sorta figured out the whole no-Santa thing.
- That's a myth.
- Yeah.
No, I mean, it's a myth that it's a myth.
There is a Santa Claus.
The advantage of having a 1,000-year-old girlfriend.
Inside scoop.
- There's a Santa Claus?
- Mm-hm.
Been around since the 1500s.
He wasn't always called Santa, but Christmas night, flying reindeer, coming down the chimney all true.
All true?
Well, he doesn't traditionally bring presents so much as disembowel children, but otherwise The reindeer part was nice.
Damn it!
I hate this oven.
It burnt.
No, it's just blackened.
You know, it's Cajun pie.
- Shall I open another?
- Oh, do you think we dare?
As long as you two stay away from the band candy, I'm cool with anything.
You are a demon child.
- I live to tormentyou.
Is that so wrong?
- A daughter's duty, I suppose.
Look, all we have to do is just cut off Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
MOM?
!
- 911 emergency.
- Hello?
It's my mom.
She's not breathing.
- Is she conscious?
- No.
I can't She's not breathing.
I need you to give me your address.
- I'm gonna send an ambulance over.
- 1630 Revello.
It it's a house.
Revello, near Hadley.
I'm sending a unit right away.
Are you alone in the house?
- Yes.
- Did you see what happened?
Did she fall?
No, no.
I came home, and she What should I do?
Do you know how to administer CPR?
- No.
I don't remember.
- OK.
It's very simple.
You wanna tiltyour mother's head back.
Cover her mouth with yours, and breathe into her mouth.
I knowthis.
I knowthis.
God!
I can do this.
I can do this.
I Are you there?
I broke something.
- Hello?
- It cracked.
- Is she breathing?
- No.
Paramedics should be there soon.
You might have cracked a rib.
It's not important.
She's cold.
- The body is cold?
- No, my mom!
Should I make her warm?
No.
If she's not responding to CPR, the best thing is to wait for the paramedics, OK?
- When will they be here?
- They're very nearby.
I have to make a call.
- Hello?
- Giles.
You have to come.
Buffy?
She's at the house.
She's in here.
- I'm getting no pulse.
- Let's lay her out.
- How long's she been like this?
- I found her.
A few minutes.
- Was she conscious?
- No.
- I'm baggin' her.
- What?
We'll intubate.
Try to get her to breathe.
This your mother?
- Yes.
- She have any serious health problems?
No.
I mean, there was a tumour.
A brain tumour.
But she had an operation, and she's fine now.
She she's been fine.
We got her!
My God, we got her!
We never brought one backthis late.
- Buffy?
- I'm here.
It's a miracle.
That's what it is - a beautiful miracle.
- Good as new.
- Buffy, thank God you found me in time She's cold, man.
Call it.
- I'm sorry.
- What do we do now?
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you thatyour mother's dead.
She died a good while before you found her.
There's nothing you could have done.
I guess it was an aneurysm or clotting.
Some complication from surgery.
She probably felt very little pain.
I'm gonna call it in.
The coroner's office will take her in and determine the cause of death.
Dispatch 7, we have a 206.
What's your status?
- We're moving.
- Location is Beaumont and 9th.
Go now.
- We gotta fly.
- I'll call this now.
The coroner's office may take a while.
In the meanwhile, you should sit, have a glass of water.
Try not to disturb the body.
Do you need anything?
Is there someone you can call?
Someone's coming.
Let's go.
- I'm very sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Good luck.
Buffy!
What is it?
Is it Glory?
I'm waiting.
The the coroner's coming.
- What?
- I have to tell Dawn.
She's at school.
I'll go there.
I'm not sure No.
No.
Don't.
No, it's too late.
- Joyce?
- They're coming for her.
No, no.
We're - Joyce!
- We're not supposed to move the body!
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.
It's not that bad.
- How can you say it's not that bad?
- I just don't think it's that big a deal.
Kevin Berman called me a freak in front of everybody.
No, that's no big deal.
He didn't say you were a freak.
Forget it.
He just said you were freaky.
Which, you know, freaky can be sort of cool.
Yeah.
Real cool.
I'm a suicidal headcase.
It was Kirstie.
She told people you were into cutting yourself and That's such a lie!
I got cut, by accident.
One time.
Now Kevin thinks I'm a That was when you were wigging out aboutyour family.
And, of course, Kirstie's gotta turn everything into a story.
She was telling people thatyou were adopted.
What a primo bee-yatch.
I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind, that's what I'd be doing right about now.
Great.
Now I look like a wet rat.
You can't go out looking all cry-face.
That'll give Kirstie more ammo.
You know, my big sister could really beat the crap out of her.
I mean, really really.
What do you think?
Can I show my face?
You're good to go.
We're gonna be late anyway.
Kirstie alert.
- Hey, Dawn.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
You OK?
- Good.
Thanks for asking.
Bee-yatch.
OK.
Remember, we're not drawing the object.
We're drawing the negative space around the object.
Hey.
Oh.
Hey, Kevin.
Give me a sense of the spaces around.
The space in-between.
What's goin' on?
Um, negative space.
Yeah.
What's that all about?
That's pretty good.
Thanks.
I heard you had a freak-out and cutyourself.
Uh, no.
Not even.
- It was a whole It was so not - I've felt like that before.
Things get so crazed, you know?
You just feel like you wanna do something extreme.
Yeah.
I just I had a lot of intense stuff going on.
A lot of people don't understand that.
Pain.
Yeah.
Then Kirstie blabs it everywhere, cos she's It's like she thinks "I'm so hot, everybody should just bow down before me".
And I'm like "Whatever".
She's so superficial.
Everything's about clothes, or who likes who.
And there's just way more important stuff going on.
There's a lot of crucial you know, stuff.
Yeah.
This one time in History, she had this book called Annals of History.
She didn't know howto say "annals", so she kept saying Dawn.
I have to talkto you.
Um What?
Can it wait?
I'm in the middle of class.
I know.
Please, come with me.
I thought Mom was picking me up.
What's going on?
Something's going on.
- Let's go outside.
- No.
Tell me what's going on.
It's bad news.
Well, what is it?
What happened?
- It's bad.
Please, can we - Where's Mom?
Mom had an accident.
Or, um something went wrong, from the tumour.
Is she OK?
Is she But she's OK?
But It's serious, but Dawn I thinkthey're here.
Do you wanna come up?
You're double-parked.
Let 'em give me a ticket.
What do you think?
The purple, right?
Cos cos it's sombre?
No.
No, it's too depressing.
It's like I'm a funeral guy.
Well, this is this is cheerier.
Maybe I wanna be cheery, like like everything is normal?
No, that's rude.
That's that's disrespectful.
La-la-la!
I don't care!
If I had that blue one Joyce really liked the blue one.
She told me one time.
You sure it's not in your room?
I I can look again.
No, no.
I should I should wear the purple.
The purple.
I thinkthe purple.
It's just that it's so I don't know.
It doesn't mean something bad?
I think it's, um royal.
Purple means royalty.
Well, I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal!
"Oh, I'm the king of everything.
I'm better than you"!
I have to be supportive.
Buffy needs me to be supportive.
I mean God, why do all my shirts have stupid things on them?
Why can't I just dress like a grown-up?
Can't I be a grown-up?
- Sh.
- Tara.
- Sh, darling.
- I can't do this.
We can do this.
OK.
We can be there for Buffy.
And Dawn.
Little Dawn.
We can be strong.
- Strong like an Amazon?
- Strong like an Amazon, right.
But I wish I had the blue.
So, what do we do?
I'm not sure.
Willowtalked to Giles.
Xander, what will we do?
What will we be expected to do?
Hey.
How you doing?
I knowthe feeling.
I'm afraid I'm gonna start to cry again.
Xander cried at the apartment.
It was weird.
It's a It's a thing we do.
What's going to happen?
Well, I I guess we're gonna meet them at the morgue.
That's where they were taking her.
Um, Giles said that he was gonna go with Joyce, and Buffy was gonna go to the school to tell Dawn.
God!
- Do you know howto get - Yeah.
It's at the hospital.
It's a wing.
We do morgue time in the Scooby gang.
I have to change.
- What else did Giles say?
- Not a lot.
Are they sure this was natural?
I mean, Glory.
Giles was pretty sure that it wasn't her.
But she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family.
- I don't - I mean, she could have done it, and - covered her tracks.
- Why would she?
She'd want us to know.
I'll tell you what it is.
It's the frickin' doctors.
They just let her out.
Clean bill of health.
Dig a hole in your skull - here's a Band-Aid.
Next!
Xander They should have checked her.
They should have had her in.
We don't have enough monsters?
The doctors gotta help 'em out?
I don't think it was It just happened.
Things don't happen!
I mean They don't justhappen.
Somebody I mean, somebody's got OK.
Let's go.
Come on, you and me.
Come on.
You know I can't take you.
Damn straight.
- Are we gonna see the body?
- What?
Are we gonna be in the room with the dead body?
I don't know.
No.
But I guess we should take over patrolling.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- For however long.
- You know it.
I can't wear this.
I really should have the other.
Joyce liked it so.
Do you think you could have left it in the laundry room?
Maybe.
I'll go check.
I'll just be one minute.
We're cool.
- Are they gonna cut the body open?
- Oh, my God!
Would you just stop talking?
Just shutyour mouth.
Please.
- What am I doing?
- How can you act like that?
Am I supposed to be changing my clothes a lot?
Is that the helpful thing to do?
- Guys - You behave - Nobody will tell me.
- Because it's not OK to askthese things!
But I don't understand!
I don't understand howthis all happens, how we go through this.
I mean, I knew her, and then she's There's just a body.
And I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead any more.
It's stupid.
It's mortal and stupid.
And Xander's crying and not talking.
And I was having fruit punch.
And I thought "Well, Joyce will never have any more fruit punch ever, and she'll never have eggs, or yawn or brush her hair, not ever".
And no one will explain to me why.
We don't know how it works.
Or why.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Some pent-up Xander?
- Where did your hand go?
- As I said, some frustration, and now, uh - I appear to be stuck.
- My God.
Is your hand OK?
Pretty much.
I'm really sorry.
You could have hit an electrical thing!
And once again with the sorry.
Did it make you feel better?
- For a second there.
- A whole second?
- In my defence, some crappy wallmanship.
- Yeah.
You can hear everything next door.
- Who did the dry wall in this place?
- I always forget to ask.
- Did I miss something?
- Xander decided that he blames the wall.
- Can you turn your wrist?
- Hold on.
It's OK.
It hurts.
Here, wash it off.
- Band-Aids?
- Underneath.
I couldn't find it.
It doesn't matter.
We should get there.
Yes.
I wanna be there for Buffy.
You're right.
The Avengers gotta get with the assembling.
We'll go.
We'll deal.
We'll help.
That's what we do.
We help Buffy.
How are we going to help?
If there's anything we can do Glad you're here.
- Love you so much.
- I know.
They're not telling us anything.
Doctor?
- OK, I've examined your mother's body.
- Can we see her?
Dawn, not now.
The on-site report seems more or less accurate.
Your mother did have what looks like an aneurysm.
A sudden haemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the - Where the tumour was removed.
- Shouldn't we have known about that?
That was a danger?
Sometimes these things are detectable, and sometimes they're not.
Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects.
She didn't even get on the phone, so clearly this was very sudden.
She may have felt a little nausea, and probably passed out as it happened.
I doubt there was much pain, and even if someone had been by her side - My head.
- Mom?
it's doubtful that this could have been dealt with in time.
Thank you, Doctor.
Are you sure that there wasn't a lot of pain?
Absolutely.
I have to lie to make you feel better.
What, uh What needs to be done now?
Well, there, uh there'll be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make.
Buffy, why don'tyou let me handle those as much as I can?
- Please.
- We will need you to sign release forms.
Yes.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll figure out which ones you need to see.
We'll be here.
What did the doctor say?
Nothing.
It's, you know, it's what we thought, the tumour.
Why don't we sit down?
Giles says he's gonna go over the paperwork.
Man, if there's one day they should not give you homework.
Dawnie, do you wanna sit?
I don't think we're gonna have to be here very long.
What about What about what?
Nothing.
I have to pee.
- Do you want someone to go with you?
- No.
- I still remember howto pee.
- Do you know where it is?
Yeah.
I think maybe she's mad at me or something.
- Cos you were the one that told her?
- How'd she take it?
Meltdown.
She just wouldn't believe me.
I still don't think she does.
I wish that Joyce didn't die.
Because she was nice.
And now we all hurt.
Anya, ever the wordsmith.
Thank you.
Do you want anything?
Something to eat, or soda?
Honestly, I couldn't tell.
Well, I think you should try to eat something.
Yeah, maybe Dawn could use a snack.
I'll find something.
Xander, do you have any money?
- We'll come with.
- We'll be right quick.
I'm sorry you have to go through all of this.
You don't have to worry about me.
Everybody wants to help.
I don't even know if I'm here.
I don't know what's going on.
Never done this.
That's just an amazingly dumb thing to say.
Obviously, I've never done this before.
I have.
My mother died when I was 17.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
No, no.
I didn't mean to I'm only telling you this because I know it's not my place, but There's things thoughts and reactions I had that I couldn't understand or even try to explain to anyone else.
Thoughts that made me feel like I was losing it, or like I was some kind of horrible person.
I know it's different for you because it's always different, but if you ever need Was it sudden?
- What?
- Your mother.
No.
And yes.
It's always sudden.
We panicked.
Uh-huh.
- Have anything you want.
- The sandwiches are meat.
I'm just not hungry.
What about Dawnie?
- Is she still in the bathroom?
- I guess.
You guys wait here.
Dawn?
Is she cold?
It's not her.
It's not her.
She's gone.
Where'd she go?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- What're you doin'?
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Your mother's dead.
- She just wouldn't believe me.
Oh, God.
- I still don't think she does.
- I'm not real.
You're the Key.
Go.
Before she finds you.
She's here.
Buffy, you're here.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Did you find something?
This one.
It's a fine choice.
It speaks of your deep feeling for the deceased.
- You don't like it?
- No, it's not that.
It's just, what if Mom What if she'd like something else better?
- Dawn - I mean, how do we knowfor sure?
She's the one who has to be in it for ever.
Dawn, maybe it wasn't such a good idea you coming along.
It's fine.
It's I'm serious.
You shouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
- If you'd like a few more minutes to decide - No.
It's done.
It's fine.
OK?
OK.
prices in different florist's.
And the funeral home seems to be fairly competitive.
- Let's just go with that.
It's simpler.
- What colour flowers?
- White?
They're nice.
- Yeah.
What about an announcement?
People are gonna expect a wake after the burial, unless we say something.
We could say in the programme your mother preferred not to have one.
- There's no wake?
- Mom didn't like them.
She said that potlucks are depressing enough as it is.
She said that?
When?
Right before she went in for the operation.
We had a talk about what she wanted, in case She never said anything to me.
I'm sure she just didn't wanna upsetyou, Dawnster.
You'd better get working on that dinner.
You've barely touched it.
You really should eat something.
- Why should I?
You're not.
- This isn't about I'm all phoned out.
Will you?
Unless it's my dad.
Of course.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, they did.
Thank you.
The funeral is at three tomorrow.
Do you knowthe Brown Brothers' mortuary?
- Can't believe he still hasn't called.
- Your dad's still AWOL, huh?
The number he left for us in Spain is no good, and I've left messages everywhere.
How about a line that says "After the burial there will be no wake"?
Or "gathering"?
"At the request of Joyce there will be no gathering"?
That sounds lame.
What are we gonna do?
After, I mean.
Are we just gonna come back here?
I don't know.
I guess so.
How about "At the request of the family, there will be no wake"?
- Good, yeah.
- I don't wanna be here.
Do you put it at the top, or just a small line at the bottom?
Can I go to your place tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
- After everything.
Well, maybe you and Buffy should I don't mind.
- Can I?
- Huh?
Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
If you want to.
I guess so.
I'll get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
- You goin' home?
- I'm gonna stop by my mom's first.
- Been doing that a lot lately.
- Yeah.
I might stop by your mom's too.
Well, I'm not going to my place.
Those people are scary.
Speaking of You have got to be kidding.
- I'm not going in.
- And you're not leaving those.
You think you'll score points with Buffy this way?
- This isn't about Buffy.
- Bull.
We're all hip to your doomed obsession.
They're for Joyce.
- Like you care about her.
- Guys, guys, not here.
Care?
Joyce was the only one of the lot of you that I could stand.
And the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag.
I'm touched.
I liked the lady.
Understand, Monkey Boy?
She was decent.
She didn't put on airs.
She always had a nice cuppa for me.
And she never treated me like a freak.
- Her mistake.
- Think whatyou want.
Unbelievable.
The guy thinks he can put on a big show and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.
Xander, he didn't leave a card.
We commend to Almighty God our sister, Joyce Summers and we commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
The Lord bless her and keep her.
The Lord makes his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her.
The Lord lift up his countenance upon her and give her peace.
Dawn's ready to go.
Can we take her with us?
Yeah.
She should probably get outta here.
What aboutyou?
We can wait if you want.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't come sooner.
Oh, Dawn.
I wish I could help more.
The only thing is, it'll get better.
I promise.
- You don't knowthat.
- Sure she does.
We're witches.
We know stuff.
What?
Life goes on, and I forget Mom?
Is that whatyou're saying?
Not forget, no.
I You You make a place for her in your heart.
It's sort of like she becomes a part of you.
Does that make sense?
Dawn We don't have to talk about this now.
You could just go to sleep.
No.
I don't wanna sleep.
OK.
We can just sit, or whatever you want.
Good.
Cos I know - what I wanna do now.
Great.
What are you up for?
You guys are witches, and you do magic and stuff.
You want us to teach you something?
Like a glamour?
Or I could make a stuffed animal dance.
I wanna do a spell.
I wanna bring Mom back.
- That was different.
- Yeah.
- It was more intense.
- It's because of Joyce.
Right.
Huh?
Well, she got me thinking - about how people die all the time, and howthey get born too, and how you kind of need one so you can have the other.
When I think about it that way, it makes death a little less sad and sex a little more exciting.
- Again, I say "huh"?
- I just think I understand sex more now.
It's not just about two bodies smooshing together.
It's about life.
It's about making life.
Right, when two people are much older, and way richer, and far less stupid.
Breathe.
You're turning colours.
I'm not ready to make life with you, but I could.
We could.
Life could come out of our love and our smooshing, and that's beautiful.
It all makes me feel like we're a part of something bigger.
Like I'm more awake somehow.
You know?
Yeah, I do.
Of course you wanna bring your mother back, and I wish we could, but it's not possible.
Why?
You guys do magic for all kinds of things.
We do, but This is different.
Magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things.
But all you do is mess with the natural order of things.
- You make things float and disappear.
- But we don't mess with life and death.
Dawn, I know how bad you hurt.
You don't.
- They put her in the ground.
- They did, and it's awful and unfair.
But this isn't the way.
I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn.
I mean, I've seen things on resurrection, but There's books and stuff.
- I guess the spells backfire.
- That's not the point.
That's not the point.
The point is, it's bad, because Because witches can't be allowed to alter the fabric of life for selfish reasons.
Wiccans took an oath a long time ago to honour that.
So it's possible?
To bring someone back?
They wouldn't have taken an oath if they didn't knowthey could do it.
Maybe they could, but we can't.
She's right, Dawn.
It's too dangerous.
You said you wanted to help me.
Dawn The funeral was It was brutal.
But it's tomorrowthat I'm worried about.
What's tomorrow?
That's exactly what I don't know.
Up until now, I've had a road map.
Things to do every minute, having to do with Mom.
Tomorrowthe stuff of everyday living resumes.
And everybody expects me to know howto do it, because I'm so strong.
You just need some time.
I'm sure everybody understands that.
Time's not the issue.
I can stick wood in vampires, but Mom was the strong one in real life.
She always knew howto make things better, just what to say.
Yeah.
You'll find your way.
I mean, not all at once, but in I don't know.
I keep thinking about it - when I found her.
If I had just gotten there ten minutes earlier You said they told you it wouldn't have made a difference.
They said "probably" wouldn't have made a difference.
The exact thing they said was "probably".
I haven't told that to anyone.
Doesn't make ityour fault.
You couldn't have done anything different.
I didn't even start CPR until they told me.
I fell apart.
- That's how good I am at being a grown-up.
- Buffy And it'd be OK if it was just me I had to worry about.
- But Dawn - Look, it's OK.
I know you don't feel like it now, butyou are strong, Buffy.
You're gonna figure this out.
And you have people to help you.
You don't have to do this alone.
It's gonna be light soon.
I can stay in town as long as you want me.
How's for ever?
Does for ever work for you?
That's a bad idea.
I'm seriously needy right now.
Let me worry about the neediness.
I can handle it.
I told you.
You'd better go.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I'm so grateful thatyou came, Angel.
I didn't think I was gonna be able to make it through the night.
Well, we still have a few more minutes until I have to go.
Good.
Good.
Tell my sister I'm sick of running into her Jawa rejects.
She bade me come to you.
The news of your relationship with the Slayer We don't have one.
- You attempted to court her, did you not?
- You're more fun when I hityou.
It's just, Glory would like to encourage this interest of yours in the Slayer.
It might lead to more information about the Key.
And why would I share that with the Most Unstable One?
Time is running short, sir.
Every momentyou fight Glory, you're only fighting yourself, you see?
Fine.
Let the best me win.
Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the Key.
I would never do that to an innocent An innocent?
The Key?
- Interesting choice of words.
- That's not what I I understand.
Sorry to bother you.
I'll leave.
You understand what?
When I said "innocent" I didn't mean that the Key is - It's not a person.
- Of course not.
You're gonna tell her, aren'tyou?
Do you know what'll happen if she finds the Key?
- How many people will die?
- I heard nothing.
I can't let that happen.
Don'tyou see?
I can't.
We're heading down to breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.
- OK.
It's just, we have class after that, and I didn't know if you want to go home, or I was gonna sleep some more.
Giles said he'd pick me up whenever.
OK.
Great.
Sure, hang out.
I have a break around lunchtime.
I can come back.
- I might not be here.
- Well, I'll try my luck.
Take care, Dawn.
"Age of Levitation".
"War of the Warlocks".
"Resurrection: A Controversy Born".
You don't have to do that, Dawn.
Just relax.
Yes, sit down.
We have some very amusing chicken feetyou can play with.
That's OK.
Don'tyou watch television?
I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.
I like being useful.
It keeps my mind off things.
Then useful you shall be.
I can always use a hand.
Butyou have a hand.
A paid hand.
A hand that isn't the hand of illegal child labour.
Anya.
But of course, it's wonderful that you find doing my job so distracting.
I am unthreatened.
Proceed.
Yes, carry on, Dawn.
Is there anything I should know, like off-limits stuff?
Willowtold me that some of the books and things are kind of dangerous.
Quite right.
But they're all labelled and kept off the floor.
Most of our more potent texts and potions are all up there.
If anyone asks you about anything in that area, just come and get me.
OK.
Anything else?
If you like, I could teach you howto workthe cash register.
- You can ring up sales.
- Cool.
Ring up sales?
With the money?
She gets to fondle the money?
- Customer.
Hello, customer.
- I'll just be a moment.
- I'll help you.
- No problem.
Dawn.
Do you want to watch this transaction thatAnya's doing?
Then I'll letyou try.
You got it.
I hope it's just dirtyou're after.
If the spell calls for anything more, you're into zombie territory, and that's bad news.
- Spike, I wasn't - I know good and well whatyou're up to.
That book you've got is infamous.
Please, don't tell Buffy.
I just I have to get her back.
I have to.
I'm not gonna tell, little bit.
I'm gonna help.
I've never used this bloke's services, but there's talk.
Word is, he knows everything there is to know about resurrection spells.
Come on, now.
No worries.
You don't have to be all nice to me.
I know why you're doing this.
Do you, now?
Enlighten me.
Spike, I'm not stupid.
You're, like, stalking my sister.
You'd do anything to get in good with her.
Buffy never hears about this, OK?
Found out, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
Then, if you don't want credit, why are you helping me?
I just don't like to see Summers women take it so hard on the chin, is all.
And I'm dead serious.
You breathe a word of this to Buffy, I'll see to it thatyou end up in the ground.
Got it?
Yeah.
Got it.
Where is he?
He should have been back hours ago.
I'm sure Jinx is on his way, Your New-And-lmprovedness.
- He's most loyal to - He'd better be loyal.
Jinxie?
Oh, no, no.
Mind the rug, honeys.
Blood's a bitch.
Was this the Slayer?
- I'll pull her wings off.
- No.
It was Ben.
Ben?
Ben?
Oh, God, you pointless, stupid lump.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
The Key.
He told me.
The Key?
What about the Key?
He indicated that it was a person, Most Highest You.
- The Key's in human form?
- I believe so, Good One.
Jinx, you robed stud, you're my man.
I'm even gonna letyou slide on the lame toadying, on account of your dying and stuff.
So, the Key's all secreted away in a flesh wrapper.
This narrows the search in a serious way.
We didn't have a clue.
It could have been a log or a bicycle pump or whatever.
Am I right?
Get him fixed.
I wanna hear the whole story again without all that annoying moaning.
This place belongs to a magic guy?
It smells like Grandpa.
Anybody home?
- I know you.
- I don't think so, mate.
No.
You're that guy, that guy, hangs around down at the corner mart.
- Big into dominoes, aren'tyou?
- Can't say I am.
We came here because That's crazy, isn't it?
I mean, I'd swear you were that guy.
I mean, your hair's a different colour and you're a vampire, but other than that - Maybe we should just go.
- No.
Now, just because the lights are dim doesn't mean the juice is all gone.
- What can I do for you?
- This one's mum kicked it a few days back.
I'm so sorry.
We were wondering what's to be done about it.
Heard you were the one to ask.
No, no, that's You don't wanna mess with that.
I know some tonics.
They can make the grieving fly by I don't want any tonics.
Either one of you witches?
Got any experience with spells of this magnitude?
Didn't think so.
Your mother's a good candidate, at least.
Strong DNA.
Right.
I've gathered some ingredients.
But the spell I found There's things on it I don't understand.
We've got the Ghora demon standing between you and success.
- That's the translation you were missing.
- Ghora.
I've heard of those.
They local?
Yeah.
They like to stick close to the Hellmouth.
Egg of the Ghora gives life.
It's key to the spell.
Can you buy it, this egg, or If it was as easy as making an omelette, everyone would try it.
No.
You have to steal the egg from the nest of the demon.
- And the Ghora won't be happy about it.
- Where do we find this demon?
First things first.
We'll need an image of your mother.
A photo, a painting.
No problem.
Once you get all the ingredients together, put them in the centre of a sacred circle with the photo of your mother.
Then, say this incantation three times.
She won't appear, you know, poof!
It'll take a while, but she will come to you.
Got it?
Got it.
Anything goes wrong, the only way to reverse the spell is to destroy the image of your mother.
Understand?
- I'll do it right.
- It's a tricky spell, girl.
I can't say for sure your mother will come back exactly like she was.
Sometimes these things get a little off.
But she'll still be my mother.
- Won't she?
- More or less.
Good.
Good.
- And the Ghora?
- Oh, right.
Sorry.
Go in the sewer entrance near Tracy Street.
The opening's on the left.
Can't miss it.
Just followthat down.
No, no.
Keep your money.
Thank you.
You just keep in touch now.
Let me know how it goes.
I will.
It's here.
Just like he said.
So, at least we knowthe old coot isn't completely daft.
Look, you better let me snatch this egg thing on my own.
No way.
I'm going.
No, you are not.
I've got no idea what's down there.
You need me, Spike.
Somebody's gotta get the egg while you distract the Ghora.
Now, come on.
Well, what do you know?
Bitty Buffy.
- Doesn't look so bad.
- Wait till it wakes up.
That's usually when the bad starts.
I can't get to the eggs unless it moves.
No way.
I'll make it move.
You just be ready.
Ghora.
Heads up.
Right.
Heads it is.
Over here, triptych.
If that's the bestyou can Dawn.
Get away from her.
- Missed me.
- Spike, come on.
- Leave it.
- I can't.
Mom.
It's too dangerous, and I haven't got a weapon.
Dawn.
Get away from her.
Missed.
Come on, basset.
Spike.
- Sorry.
- Did you get it?
Don't be sorry, then.
Osiris, giver of darkness, taker of life, god of gods, accept my offering.
Bone, flesh, breath.
Yours, eternally.
Bone, flesh, breath I beg of you, return to me.
What did I have for breakfast this morning?
Do you remember?
I wanna say bagel, but I thinkthat was yesterday.
You had two eggs, sunny-side up.
I remember, because they were wiggling at me like little boobs.
Sassy eggs.
What are you writing this for?
My journal.
- That's new.
- Yeah.
I figured, life goes by so fast, if you don't write stuff down, it just gets lost.
- And I wanna remember.
- Down to every last bagel.
Down to every last everything I do with you.
- What?
- What happened to History of Witchcraft?
I It isn't there?
- Dawn must have taken it.
- No, she didn't.
Did she?
This is bad.
This is really bad.
But it's just a history book.
It might answer some of her questions.
I don't think she could do any harm with that stuff.
It's not a how-to guide, but it refers to specific resurrection spells and potions.
But I didn't I mean How'd she knowthat?
I don't know, but God, what else did she take?
Nothing.
I I think.
I I think she took nothing else.
But maybe she did, and we should probably look.
Because who knows?
I I don't.
No, we can't waste time on that now.
We don't know what she's up to.
We have to call Buffy.
Now.
Hello?
Bone, flesh, breath, yours eternally.
Bone, flesh, breath, I beg of you, return to me.
Dawn.
- What have you done?
What have you done?
- She's coming.
She's coming home.
Dawn.
Dawn.
You have no idea whatyou're messing with.
Who knows whatyou actually raised?
No, I know.
It'll be her.
No.
Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time.
- People come back wrong.
- She won't.
He told me her DNA - Who told you?
Who helped you?
- Nobody.
- Let me go.
- You have to stop it.
Reverse it.
No.
Dawn.
You knowthis is wrong.
You know you can't let this happen.
Not to Mom.
But I need her.
I don't care if she I'm not like you, Buffy.
I don't have anybody.
What?
Of course you do.
You have me.
No, I don't.
You won't even look at me.
- It's so obvious you don't want me around.
- That's not true.
Yes, it is.
Mom died, and it's like you don't even care.
Of course I care.
How can you even thinkthat?
How can I not?
You haven't even cried.
You've just been running around like it's been some big chore or something.
Cleaning up after Mom's mess.
Oh, my God.
Dawn I've been working.
I've been busy, because I have to No.
You've been avoiding me.
I'm not.
I have to do these things cos cos when I stop, then she's really gone.
And I'm trying.
Dawn, I am really trying to take care of things, but I don't even know what I'm doing.
- Mom always knew.
- Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
Well, who's gonna be if I'm not?
Huh, Dawn?
Have you even thought about that?
Who's gonna make things better?
Who's gonna take care of us?
- Buffy - I didn't mean to push you away.
I didn't.
I just I couldn't letyou see me.
Oh, God, Dawnie I don't know what we're gonna do.
- I'm scared.
- Buffy Mommy?
- Buffy.
- Mom.
Dawn.
It's OK.
It's OK.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Your sister took my Key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back.
I betyou know where she put it.
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life".
"So they sent the Key to her in the form of a sister".
Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the Key.
I'd never do that to an innocent.
- An innocent?
- It's not a person.
- What about the Key?
- He indicated that it was a person.
Oh, God, no.
I love you.
The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
You are not my boyfriend!
- I got the impression she was a - Robot.
- Yeah, robot.
- She's a robot.
I made her to love me.
I didn't make a toy.
- I made a girlfriend.
- I'm placing an order.
- I'm not making any more girls.
- Sure you are.
Here's your specs.
Mom?
What are you doin'?
Mommy?
We commend to Almighty God our sister, Joyce Summers.
- But it's tomorrowthat I'm worried about.
- What's tomorrow?
That's exactly what I don't know.
- Giles, you don't have to help.
You cooked.
- Come on.
I quite like to cook.
- Helping you two out makes me feel useful.
- Wanna clean out the garage on Saturday?
- You'd feel indispensable.
- Howtempting.
Dawn, get the plates from your room before they get furry and we have to name them.
I was, like, five then.
How's she doing?
And you?
I'm OK.
Well, some minutes are harder than others.
I'm so sorry.
All I can say is, it will get better.
It has to.
We're holding up, though.
You know, getting into a routine.
Good.
Routine's good.
In fact, I was thinking that we might return to our training schedule.
I don't know.
I was thinking about maybe taking a break or something.
Just ease off for a while.
Not get into full slay mode.
You were doing so well.
And you were great, helping me with everything.
I'm just starting to feel uneasy about stuff.
- Stuff?
- Training.
Slaying.
All of it.
I just I mean, I can beat up the demons until the cows come home.
And then I can beat up the cows.
- But I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
- Butyou've mastered so much.
- I mean, your strength and resilience alone - Yeah.
Strength, resilience.
Those are all words for hardness.
I'm starting to feel like being the Slayer is turning me into stone.
Turning you into stone?
Buffy Just think about it.
I was never there for Riley.
Not like I was for Angel.
- I was terrible to Dawn.
- At a time like this - No.
- you're bound to feel emotionally numb.
Before that.
Riley left because I was shut down.
He's gone.
And now my mom is gone.
And I loved her more than anything.
And I don't know if she knew.
She knew.
- Always.
- I don't know.
To slay, to kill, it means being hard on the inside.
Maybe being the perfect slayer means being too hard to love at all.
I already feel like I can hardly say the words.
- Buffy - Giles I love you.
Love, love, love, love, love.
Giles, it feels strange.
Well, I shouldn't wonder.
How serious are you about this?
Ten.
Serious to the amount of ten.
There is something in the Watchers' Diaries.
- A quest.
- A quest?
- Like finding a grail or something?
- Not a grail.
Maybe answers.
It would take a day, perhaps two.
I'm not leaving Dawn.
Not with Glory looking for her.
Sure you can.
What's the deal?
Some slayers before Buffy found it helpful in regaining their focus, in learning more about their role.
There's a sacred place in the desert.
It's not far.
But I can't go.
I'm not leaving you, Dawn.
If you have to go learn I mean, if it'll help you out, I think you should do it.
I can hang with the gang.
I'll be OK.
I love you, Dawn.
You knowthat, right?
Yeah.
I love you too.
I love you.
Really love you.
- Gettin' weird.
- Sorry.
But it's important that I tell you.
Weird love's better than no love.
Some say it's better than the real thing.
Better than the real thing.
She looks good, but what about the rest?
A little walk, a little talk Perhaps a zippy cartwheel She's great.
You'll be real happy, I swear.
She's got everything you asked for.
All the extra programming: real-world knowledge, the profiles on family and friends.
All the extra programming, right?
The stuff thatyou wanted.
The scenario responses, you know, the special skills - All of it.
Now, you said I could leave town - Wait.
I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer.
She looks a little shiny to me.
You know, a touch of Plasticine Spike?
Spike.
She'll do.
He's getting stronger.
I'm losing him, I'm losing control of him.
You're speaking of Ben, Most Glamorous-Yet-Tasteful One?
He stabbed you in your body.
Jinx is all right, Your Highness.
And we have the new knowledge that the Key is a human.
If time runs out on us and all we're left with is info, then we're screwed.
- Surely not.
- No, we're screwed.
Butyou are a god.
The sacred Glorificus!
I'm a god in exile.
Far from the hellfires of home, and sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their fleshy little stomachs.
I'm in pain.
How can we help?
We'll lay down our lives.
The Slayer and the Key are connected.
She's going to have contact with it.
Find out who's new in her life, who's special, who's different.
- Watch her.
- We can do that, O Thou.
I want to hear about everyone she has contact with!
That girl has my Key, and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me.
If you love me get it for me.
- What's in the trunk?
- Supplies.
Supplies?
I was wondering about that.
Like food, water, maybe a compass?
What about a book, a gourd and a bunch of twigs?
- I don't think I'll be that hungry.
- They're for me.
This way.
You see the location of the sacred place is a guarded secret.
I can't take you there myself.
I'll have to perform a ritual to transfer my guardianship of you, temporarily, to a guide.
This'll do.
A guide, but no food or water?
So it leads me to the sacred place, and a week later leads you to my bleached bones?
Buffy, please.
It takes more than a weekto bleach bones.
So, how's it start?
I jump out of the circle, then I jump back in it, and then - I shake my gourd.
- I knowthis ritual!
"The shamans were called upon to do the hokey-pokey and turn themselves around".
Go quest.
And that's what it's all about.
Whatyou searching for, Slayer?
A weak spot?
Try me.
Give me the bestyou've got.
- Is thatyour best, Slayer?
- No.
- Why not?
- I wanna hurtyou, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body.
Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness and letyou go.
No!
No, Spike.
Never let me go.
You know you should be afraid of me.
I'm bad.
You are.
You're very, very bad.
- Are you gonna do it that way?
- No.
This way.
You can't do it.
I could never do it.
I'm helpless againstyou, you fiend.
Buffy Hello, kitty.
I knowthis place.
OK.
Morning spell's all set.
So we're all protected up for the night?
It's probably not as good as Willow could do.
She's a natural with magic.
In just the time I've known her, she's already blown right past me.
So when the whizz kid finishes chem lab, can you have her bulk up the spell a little?
If you want, maybe, while Anya and I go do a quick patrol?
I don't see why we have to patrol just cos Buffy's away.
I'd rather watch television.
Willow wants to watch this thing on the History Channel.
Salem witch trial stuff, which will only get her upset.
I was there.
It wasn't that bad.
If you were a witch, you could do a spell to escape.
So it was only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time.
So, guys, if this is a real slumber party, where's the pizza?
You're evil.
And that excites you?
It excites me, it terrifies me I try so hard to resistyou, and I can't.
Yeah?
Darn your sinister attraction.
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.
You know I can't bite you.
I think you can.
I think you can if I letyou, and I want to letyou.
I wantyou to bite me and devour me until there's no more.
Like this?
- Spike, devour me!
- All right.
Spike, I can't help myself.
I love you.
You're mine, Buffy.
- Should I start this program over?
- No programs.
Don't use that word.
Just be Buffy.
It's got last week's notes too.
Get it backto me by Thursday.
And don't write in it, or put a coffee mug down on it or anything.
And don't spill.
OK.
And don't fold the page corners down.
Bye!
- Time to slay.
- Yeah Vampires of the world, beware.
Hey there!
- Buffy.
- Xander!
And Anya!
- How is your money?
- Fine.
Thank you for asking.
Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
- I guess.
- You're back very early.
Yeah, how was the whole vision-quest experience?
I don't understand that question.
But thank you for asking.
You're my friend, and a carpenter.
- Are you all right?
You're all - Wait up!
Spike!
It's Spike.
And he's wearing a coat.
Yes.
Hello, all.
Buffy's back early, I see.
Lots of patrolling all round tonight, then, is it?
Give a fella a break, there, Slayer.
I'm glad you're all here, cos the place is crawling with vamps tonight.
Tons of'em.
I think we ought to split up.
We haven't seen any vamps.
Are you sure?
- You're right.
- Yep, guess so.
Spike, be careful!
No!
Get away from him.
I thinkthat was probably the big action for tonight.
You two can toddle on home if you want.
Buffy?
Yes.
Spike and I will do it alone.
You guys head home.
I don't understand this.
I did the slaying.
I should be Satisfied?
But I'm not.
I'm all My skin is all hot.
- Do I look hot to you?
- Always.
You'd better feel me to make sure.
I can do that.
I breathed in, like, a quart of vampire dust.
That can't be good.
I wish Giles had told us they were back from the desert.
What went on there?
You know, Slayer/Watcher stuff.
Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog.
Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacey.
- She fought OK.
- Yeah.
She never asked about Dawn.
That's true.
Something's wrong.
I hear something.
Spike.
You're the Big Bad.
You're the big bad!
Those darn Salem judges, with their less-satanic-than-thou attitudes.
Honey, let's change it.
The Discovery Channel has koala bears.
- Where's Dawn?
- In the bedroom.
She fell asleep.
- Good.
- What's goin' on?
- Buffy's gone insane.
- What?
What'd she do?
- Brace yourself.
You're not gonna believe it.
- Before we jump all over her, people do strange things when someone they love dies.
When I lost my mother, I did dumb stuff, like lying to my family and staying out all night.
Buffy's boinking Spike.
Well, Tara's right.
Grief can be powerful, and we shouldn't judge What, are you kidding?
She's nuts!
- Well, it's not healthy.
We all agree there.
- What can we do?
In the movies, when they go crazy they slap 'em.
I'll find her and talkto her.
If she's losing it, we gotta help her before she gets hurt.
You aren't really gonna slap her, are you?
No, but if I see her straddle Spike again, I will definitely knock myself unconscious.
Hello?
Who's there?
Who's that?
Down there.
And, no matter what, don't come out till I getyou, OK?
OK.
It's you.
I saw you, in the cemetery with Buffy.
Yeah?
Can't see how it's any business of yours.
It is my business, because Buffy's my friend.
She's gone through some stuff that affected her, and you're taking advantage of her.
She's upset about her mum.
And if she turns to me for comfort, well, I'm not gonna deny it to her.
- I'm not a monster.
- Yes, you are a monster.
Vampires are monsters.
They make monster movies about them.
Well, yeah, you got me there.
Spike, Buffy has lots of friends, and we love her very much, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect her.
If that means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus.
Gentlemen!
I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered if I might beg a moment of your time.
Friends of yours?
Guess not.
Tie his hands!
Glory will want him restrained.
- Let me go!
- Careful with him.
- She will want the Key intact.
- Key?
Who's the Key?
I'm not the I know you.
You're the first Slayer.
This is a form.
I am the guide.
I have a few questions, about being the Slayer.
What about love?
Not just boyfriend love.
You think you're losing your ability to love.
I didn't say that.
Yeah.
You're afraid that being the Slayer means losing your humanity.
Does it?
You are full of love.
You love with all your soul.
It's brighter than the fire.
Blinding.
That's why you pull away from it.
I'm full of love?
I'm not losing it?
Only if you reject it.
Love is pain, and the Slayer forges strength from pain.
Love, give, forgive.
Riskthe pain.
It is your nature.
Love will bring you to your gift.
What?
Spike?
I waited like you said, but then I missed you.
Spike?
- Xander, did you?
- Spike's gone!
Buffy.
Come in.
It's late.
Everyone's asleep.
Wait.
We can talk out here.
Did Xander find you?
He was looking for you.
He hasn't come back.
Anya sat up waiting.
I don't know where Xander is.
I haven't seen him.
And when I came out of the tunnel, Spike was gone.
I need to find him.
Buffy, this thing with Spike.
It isn't true, is it?
You didn't, you know, sleep with Spike?
No, I had sex with Spike.
I'm sorry if it bothers you.
You're my best friend.
I am, and I always will be, no matter whatyou do.
I'm just trying to figure out why this happened, and I think, with your mom and everything, everyone was being all sympathetic, and making you feel weak.
And Spike wasn't like that.
So, just this one time, you just did somethin' kinda crazy.
It wasn't one time.
It was lots of times.
And lots of different ways.
- I could make sketches.
- No!
Buffy, there is something seriously wrong here!
I mean OK, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, butAngel had a soul.
Angel's lame.
His hair goes straight up and he's bloody stupid.
OK Look, I just wanna help you.
- Let me help you.
- You're my best friend.
Yeah.
Again, I really am, but You're recently gay.
Guys!
Guys, wake up.
Xander, I was scared.
Are you hurt?
What happened?
Guys - The demony kinds of guys.
Buffy - Yes, that's me.
The guys that work for Glory, you said they're like hobbits with leprosy?
A whole flock of hobbits just grabbed Spike.
They're taking him to Glory.
- But he knows about Dawn.
- We have to get him back.
So how do we find him?
I fight with weapons.
Yeah.
I got nothin'.
Let's hityour place.
We'll stock up.
- Tara, can you stay here and watch Dawn?
- Of course.
I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.
I'm full of love, which is nice, and love will lead me to my gift?
Yes.
I'm getting a gift?
Or do you mean that I have a gift to give to someone else?
Death is your gift.
- Death - Is your gift.
OK.
No.
Death is not a gift.
My mother just died.
I knowthis.
If I have to kill demons because it makes the world a better place, then I kill demons, but it's not a gift to anybody.
Your question has been answered.
What the hell is that?
Why is its hair that colour?
- Stunning One, we believe he is - The Key!
Really?
That's fantabulous!
And impossible.
He can't be the Key.
Because, see, the Key has to be pure.
This is a vampire.
Lesson number one: vampires equal impure.
Yeah, damn right I'm impure.
I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow.
Let me go.
You can't even brain-suck a vampire.
He's completely useless.
So, I'm just gonna let myself out.
Your Unholiness, we observed the Slayer.
She protected this one above all others.
She treated him as precious.
Really?
Precious?
Let's take a peek atyou, precious.
Sod off.
- He doesn't look very fancy to me.
- Easy with the lip!
But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving.
Maybe there's something on the inside.
What do you know, precious?
What can I dig out of you?
This is my house.
If we're gonna stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're gonna need these.
The big guns.
Only not guns.
Shouldn't we have guns?
Those are my weapons.
Give me something big and sharp.
Buffy, where do we go?
Where shall we look for Glory?
She's a god.
She wants the Key.
Yeah, so we should look?
I don't know.
Why are you all looking at me?
OK, you shouldn't have to know everything.
We need to rescue Spike.
Buffy, I think you have more weapons upstairs.
Why don'tyou go get those?
And maybe change your clothes.
You know, something more fighty.
I can do that.
I'll be right back.
This has gone too far.
She thinks we're going to rescue Spike.
- What are we gonna do?
- Keep him from talking, whatever it takes.
- What do we do with Glory?
- Whatever we do, we'll need Buffy's help.
- Then we'll have to talkto her.
- Intervention time again?
Yeah, cos what we need now is a sane Buffy.
Whoa.
Group hang time?
That was quick.
Didn't seem like it to me.
Death is my gift.
Buffy, we need to talk.
- What's wrong?
Is Dawn OK?
- Dawn's fine.
Buffy, we care aboutyou, and we're worried.
The way you're acting, things you're doing - It's wrong.
- Wait.
This shouldn't be about blame.
- Blame?
There's blame now?
- No, there's only love.
And some fear.
Which is thrown by the you-having-sex-with-Spike.
The who-whatting-how-with-huh?
OK, that's denial.
That usually comes before anger.
- I am not having sex with Spike!
- Anger.
No one is judging you.
It's understandable.
Spike is strong, and mysterious, and sort of compact but well-muscled.
I am not having sex with Spike!
But I'm starting to thinkthatyou might be.
Buffy, I saw you.
Anya too.
We saw you and Spike, with the straddling.
Spike's mine.
Who's straddling Spike?
- Oh, my God.
- And so say all of us.
Say!
Look atyou.
You look just like me!
We're very pretty.
- Two of them!
- I knowthis.
They're both Buffy.
No, she's a robot.
She acts like that girlfriend-bot Warren made.
You guys couldn't tell me apart from a robot?
I don't think I'm a robot.
She's very well done.
Spike must have had her built so he could program her - Oh, God.
- Yikes.
Imagine the things - No!
No imagining!
Any of you.
- Already got the visual.
People, friends of mine, you're forgetting the most important thing.
Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him.
- Glory has Spike?
- We were gonna bring that up.
- We were getting weapons.
- Grab 'em.
We're going now.
I have to kill him.
- We don't even know where to look.
- I know where to start.
I have a riddle for you, precious.
How is a vampire that won't talk like an apple?
Think I can do you in one long strip?
Enough.
No more.
I'll tell you who the sodding Key is.
Glory's Key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it.
- You think she lives around here?
- It's not a lot to go on.
- It's all we got.
- It's quite extraordinary, really.
Thank you.
But I think we should be listening to the other Buffy, Guyles.
She's very smart and she's gonna save Spike.
"Guyles"?
Spike didn't even program my name properly!
Listen, Skirt Girl, we are not going to save him.
We're going to kill him.
He knows who the Key is, and there's no way he's not telling Glory.
You're right.
He's evil.
Butyou should see him naked.
I mean, really.
OK, split up and spread out.
Checkthe priciest-looking places first.
Xander, you come with me.
Willow, Anya, sticktogether.
And Guyles Giles, you can watch it.
Is that better?
Do you think you can try to talk again now?
Good.
Because I'm tired of these games!
"I need time.
I need a drink".
You're a needy little bloodsucker, and it's not very attractive!
So start talkin'.
Yeah.
OK.
The Key.
Here's the thing It's that guy, on TV - What's his name?
- On the television?
That show, the prize show, where they guess what stuff costs?
- The Price Is Right?
- Bob Barker.
We will bring you Bob Barker.
We will bring the limp, beaten body of Bob It is not Bob Barker, scabby morons!
The Key is newto this world.
And Bob Barker is as old as grit.
The vampire is lying to me.
Yeah, but it was fun.
And guess what, bitch.
I'm not telling you jack.
You're never gonna getyour sodding Key, cos you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot.
I am a god.
The god of what?
Bad home perms?
Shut up!
I command you, shut up!
Yeah, OK.
Sorry, but I just had no idea that gods were such prancing lightweights.
Mark my words, the Slayer is going to kick your skanky, lopsided ass backto whatever place would take a cheap, whorish, fashion-victim ex-god like you.
- Good plan, Spike.
- Bring him back.
Here!
Oh, God.
You do not insult Glory by escaping.
The Slayer!
Buffy, we're here.
Spike!
Spike's in there!
Buffy!
- The Slayer was there.
- A lethal fighter.
- She seemed to be everywhere!
- She had friends.
With weapons.
They may have been demons.
And where's my vampire?
Is it weird?
Yeah.
At least it's not a very good copy.
I mean, look at it.
Yeah.
What did you guys do with Spike?
Please let the story have a dusty ending.
- We dumped him in his crypt.
- Tried to find out if he'd told her anything, but he was too badly beaten to make much sense.
Even if he told her, he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?
Yeah, you can count on it.
But I have to know.
Now.
If he gave us up, Dawn and I need to get out of town.
She could be on her way right now.
But not to worry, you know.
I'm sure we'll all be perfectly safe.
We're safe.
Right.
And Spike built a robot Buffy to play chequers with.
It sounded convincing when I thought it.
I think I found somethin'.
Looks very complicated in there.
Personally, I'd rather look at guts.
I found where she's broken.
Some of these wires got fried extra crispy.
It's an easy fix.
I mean, not that I would.
God, I feel kind of bad for the guy.
Gets all whupped, then his best toy gets taken away.
Xander, please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
No, no, travesty.
Completely on board.
It's just the guy was so thrashed.
Spike!
You're covered in sexy wounds.
Yeah.
I feel real sexy.
Where you been?
I fell down and got confused.
Willowfixed me.
She's gay.
Will fixed you?
I'd have thought they'd meltyou into scrap.
They were confused too.
Do you wanna ravage me now?
Give us a minute.
Got some bones need mending.
Why did you let that Glory hurtyou?
She wanted to know who the Key was.
- Well, I can tell her, and then you - No!
You can't ever.
Glory never finds out.
Why?
Cos Buffy, the other, not-so-pleasant Buffy Anything happened to Dawn, it'd destroy her.
I couldn't live, her bein' in that much pain.
I'd let Glory kill me first.
Nearly bloody did.
And my robot?
The robot is gone.
The robot was gross and obscene.
- It wasn't supposed to - Don't.
That thing, it wasn't even real.
Whatyou did for me and Dawn that was real.
I won't forget it.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
- Glory isn't a demon.
She's a god.
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.
- Dawn.
- I'm not real.
You're the Key?
Go.
Before she finds you.
She's here.
I won't help her find the Key.
I would never do that to an innocent - An innocent?
- It's not a person.
- What about the Key?
- He indicated that it was a person.
- I'll tell you who the sodding Key is.
- The vampire is lying to me.
The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.
- Professor Lillian?
- Buffy.
I'm sorry that I missed the lecture today.
Was it good?
Of course it was.
- Do you want me to try?
- Yes.
Thanks.
The slide is stuck in the thing.
OK.
I just came by to tell you that I have to drop this class.
All my classes, actually.
I'm not finishing the semester.
I wish I just I can't be in school right now.
I have to take care of my sister.
Yes.
I thoughtyou might.
I was very sorry to hear aboutyour loss.
I have these forms from the registrar's office that I need you to sign.
Oh.
Yes.
Thanks.
Is there something else?
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this class.
I mean, I knowthat I wasn't the best student, but I really learned a lot.
And I really like poetry.
I really do.
- Sorry.
- I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.
I wish I had time for it.
But I just don't right now.
Well, maybe short poems.
Yeah.
Like those Japanese ones that sound like a sneeze?
- Haiku?
- Right.
Maybe those.
And hopefully I'll be back next semester.
When I'm more myself again.
Benjamin.
This is a pleasant surprise.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You're not late.
- But, sir - You can't be late to a job you don't have.
Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'll actually do it.
Honest to God, I've been calling you for two weeks.
Where have you been?
I didn't wanna I'm sorry to fire you, but I need somebody I can count on.
I haven't been here I haven't been here in two weeks.
There's an explanation for this.
Which I can't exactly give you.
I Can I just tell you it's not my fault?
Sure.
You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework, or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it, or maybe, yeah, that there's really a wicked, demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding.
Take responsibility for your actions, Ben.
All right.
This Oh, forget it.
Just forget it.
This is so unfair.
You're taking everything away.
Everything I worked for, I earned, I care about.
These are my choices.
This is my life, and you're ruining it!
No.
No.
Not here.
Not now, please.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben.
I'm Ben!
I'm Ben!
I'm hungry.
We got this part right, that's for sure.
Lot of sucky things in this dimension.
Bubble baths?
Not one of'em.
- Know what I mean?
- I am in thunderous agreement, O glittering, glistening Glorificus.
I wasn't talking to you.
Begging your pardon, and begging in general, but were you talking to me?
Yeah, right.
Like any of you have ever bathed anyway.
Oh, but we do, Your Scrumptiousness.
We bathe in your splendiferous radiance, your How aboutyou shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools?
OK.
Now, I asked for the Key, and you brought me a vampire.
A pulseless, impure, follicly fried vampire.
Loofah.
So, what I think we have here is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs.
Pardon my French.
Mimosa.
Vitamins.
So rack your minion brains and tell me everything you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals.
Everything.
- Then I'll figure out who the Key is.
- You lied to me?
Didn't lie exactly.
Really?
What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said "fine"?
Well, it was.
You didn't ask if I was in it when it was fine.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sure you're aware that the past few months, you know, have been kind of hard for Dawn.
Not that I'm saying that's an excuse.
I understand.
Your mother was a lovely woman, and we'll all miss her very much.
- I know how difficult it must be.
- It is.
Especially for Dawn.
She's just a kid.
Well, I think we both knowthat Dawn is a lot more than " just a kid".
She's a talented young girl with a sharp mind, when she puts the effort in.
I realise there's been some ball-dropping, but I'm sure this will all Dawn, why don'tyou wait outside for a few minutes?
Honey.
Old saying: "A watched customer never buys".
They would if they were patriotic.
OK, I'm goin' in.
- Patriotic?
- Yes.
I've recently come to realise there's more to me than just being human.
I'm also an American.
I suppose you are, in a manner of speaking.
You were born here.
Your mortal self.
Well, that's right, foreigner.
So I've read a lot about the good old "us of A", embracing the precious ideology that's helped to shape and define it.
- Democracy?
- Capitalism.
A free market dependent on the exchange of goods for currency.
A system of symbiotic beauty, apparently lost on these old people.
Look at 'em.
Perusing the shelves.
Undressing the merchandise with their eyeballs.
All ogle, no cash.
It's not just annoying, it's un-American.
Appalling.
Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
Totally un-American.
Oh, and you know what else is un-American?
- French people.
- You don't say.
From what I hear, they don't tip.
French old people?
That's really the bottom of the barrel.
An, how's about we try being a bit less prejudiced and a bit more inclusive?
Not us, justyou.
Fine.
I'm gonna make those fogeys buy things.
Hey, what's up?
It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.
- Hi.
- Hey, everybody.
- Everything went well at the university?
- Yep.
I'm all dropped out.
Good on you.
Welcome to the real world.
Lot of fun to be had on the outside.
You'll see.
It's just for now.
I thinkthat I'll probably go back next semester.
That's cool, too.
Whatever you choose, you've got my support.
Just think of me as as your I'm searching for supportive things, and I'm comin' up all bras, so something more manly.
Think of me as that.
Seriously.
Whatever you need.
Thank you.
Actually, I need to talkto Giles alone for a minute.
Cool.
Dawn, why don'tyou get started on your homework?
If you need help Will, could you?
OK.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
She's messing up.
I'm messing up.
It's a mess.
- You'll just have to putyour foot down.
- I try.
It's just my foot's not used to being put down.
I wantyou to do it.
You can be the foot-putting-downer.
- No, Buffy.
I don't think I can.
- Please?
Pretty please?
I mean, your foot is way bigger than mine.
And you're so much more a grown-up than me.
Dawn needs an authority figure, a strong guiding hand.
She'll listen to you.
Like you always have.
I listen.
I do.
Then perk up your ears.
I may be a grown-up, butyou're her family.
Her only real family now.
She needs you to do this.
Right.
She needs me.
Me, the grown-up.
The authority figure.
The strong guiding hand and stompy foot that is me.
That's the spirit.
OK.
- I can do this.
- I know you can.
- Please?
- No.
OK.
Here we go.
Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast, hospital corners.
It's a new beginning.
Discipline.
Authority.
Order.
What is this?
I thought I told you to do your homework.
- I was.
- Please don't lie to me.
- I'm not.
- We were acting out a geometry problem.
Cos I read this really neat article that said kids learn math better if you stimulate their visual learning pattern.
You know, using the right side of the brain instead of just the left?
Stuff like that.
So we made a triangle with our bodies.
And that's when I called Xander obtuse.
And he got really grumpy.
And then Dawn said we were "a cute" triangle.
And, well, hilarity ensued.
Right.
Well, you know what I think?
I think maybe Dawn should do her homework at home.
But it was working.
I was really learning.
Please getyour stuff.
Fine.
Don't listen to me.
Please don't be grouchy with her.
Who among us can resist the allure of really funny math puns?
It's really important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork.
Yeah, I know.
But we were having good, clean, educational fun, and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and doom and the outlawing of human triangles.
It's really important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
I know it is, and I'm a big fan of school.
You know me.
I'm like, "Go to school.
It's your birthday".
Or something to that effect.
I knowthatyou mean well.
Butyou just don't understand, and there's no way you could.
I do so understand, and - You're stressed out.
- I'm more than stressed out.
I'm freaked out.
Yeah, well, maybe you need a break, to de-freak.
You could go to the World Culture Fair if you want to, with me and Tara.
- I don't think so.
- Come on.
You can bring Dawn.
It'll be fun.
Good, educational-type fun, in a discipline-y sort of way.
I can't do it, Will.
Don't worry.
It's not like I don't have a life.
I do.
I have Dawn's life.
Ready?
So it's her.
Under our noses all this time.
I like the detailed workthose monks did.
Quirks, foibles, passions.
It's all so cute, so human.
You know?
Pretty convincing, really.
But not convincing enough.
You all know your assignments.
I think it's time to collect the Key.
It wasn't anything, really.
Buffy was just a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.
- Well, it's understandable.
- Yeah, sure it is.
I'd totally be blowing off classes if I were in Dawnie's shoes.
Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off a class if your head was on fire.
- And I meant Buffy.
- Buffy what?
Understandable, about the crabby.
She has to look after Dawn now.
Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls way.
She's just gonna make Dawnie more rebellious.
I had to deal with my brother's problems after I mean, you can't really know what it's like to Yeah, I knowthat.
- I didn't mean to - No.
I just I know I can't know whatyou went through.
But I just It's no big.
- I made you mad.
- No.
No.
- All I meant was - It's OK.
This Buffy thing, let's just forget it.
No, please.
I mean, tell me if I said something wrong.
Otherwise I know I'll say it again.
Probably often and in public.
No.
I was Snippy Gal.
It's just I know I can't On some level It's like my opinion isn't worth anything because I haven't been through I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know.
Well, I'm not the expert.
I mean, I've only lost the one.
Do I act like the Big Knowledge Woman?
No.
Is that "no" spelled y-e-s?
S-o-r-t of.
I mean, I just feel like the junior partner.
You've been doing everything longer than me.
You've been out longer.
You've been practising witchcraft way longer.
Butyou're way beyond me there.
In just a few I mean, it frightens me how powerful you're getting.
That's a weird word.
"Getting"?
It frightens you?
- I frighten you?
- That is so not what I meant.
I meant impresses.
Impressive.
Well, I took Psych 101.
I mean, I took it from an evil government scientist who was skewered by her Frankenstein-like creation, but I know what a Freudian slip is.
Don'tyou trust me?
- With my life.
- That's not what I mean.
- Can't we just go to the fair?
- I don't feel real multicultural right now.
What is it about me thatyou don't trust?
It's not that.
I worry, sometimes.
You're changing so much, so fast.
- I don't know where you're heading.
- Where I'm heading?
- I'm saying everything wrong.
- No.
I think you're being pretty clear.
This isn't about the witch thing.
It's about my other changes.
I trustyou.
I just I don't know where I'm gonna fit in, in your life, when When I change back?
Yeah, this is a college thing, just a little experimentation before I get over the thrill and head backto Boys Town.
- You thinkthat?
- Should I?
I'm really sorry that I didn't establish my lesbo street cred before I got into this relationship.
You're the only woman I've ever fallen in love with, so how on earth could you ever take me seriously?
- Willow, please.
- Have fun at the fair.
OK.
So I thinkthe next step is to make a chart, a schedule.
I'll write down the things you're supposed to do and when to do them.
Then I'll leave a box next to it, which you can mark with an X when you've done the task.
What?
You want gold stars?
OK.
You can have gold stars.
I don't want gold stars.
I don't want any of this.
I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
Good luck.
What?
What am I doing wrong now?
This is for real, Dawn.
No, it's not.
I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real?
Who cares if a Key gets an education anyway?
It's a chart, not a graph.
And you are real.
Yeah?
Those monks put grades K through eight in my head.
Can't we just wait and see if they drop nine in there too?
Damn it, Dawn.
This is serious.
Why?
Why should I care about any of this?
Because they'll take you away!
Take me away?
What do you mean?
They'll take you away from me.
That's whatyour principal told me when you weren't in the room.
If I can't make you go to school, then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
Where would I go?
I don't know.
Dad, maybe.
Or foster care.
I didn't really wanna ask.
You could've told me that.
I just did.
Is this seat taken?
I hope this isn't a return.
Everyone wants petrified hamsters, and they're never happy with them.
You all right?
Yeah.
Ah, yes, because your good mood is both obvious and contagious.
I had a fight with Tara.
It was awful.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Me, too.
- You two don't quarrel much, do you?
- Never.
Until today.
- Well, it's over.
- Over?
How can it be over?
I just found her.
The quarrel is over.
Yeah.
You'll feel better when you've apologised and know you can fight without the world ending.
I know it all seems bleak now but, as they say, "This too shall pass".
- Wow!
- What do we have here?
- He's one of those things that work for Glory.
- Yes.
How helpful.
I do indeed work for the god.
Let me go if you do not wish to incur her anger.
Well, she's not here.
What a marvellous opportunity for you and me to talk.
I will not betray Glorificus.
I will never talk, no matter what heinous torture Actually, you're talking quite a lot, just not about the right things.
Tell us why you're here.
No words shall pass my lips that would bring peril to Glorificus.
Girls, get the twine that's on the counter.
Let's tie him up.
Don't!
I'll tell you anything.
Please.
Whatever you want.
Just Anything.
- What happened?
- He changed his mind.
I'm I'm supposed to watch.
We're watching the Slayer's people while Glory fetches the Key.
- Glory knows who the Key is?
- Oh, God.
- We've gotta call Buffy.
- Too late.
Too late.
Glorificus will find the witch and you can't stop her.
- Witch?
What do you mean?
- Tara.
She's new among you.
It wasn't hard to figure out.
The Glorious One will have found her.
- Willow, wait.
I'll - No.
Call Buffy and go look in Tara's room.
I'm gonna checkthe fair.
This is nice.
Just hangin' out, just us girls.
You like this sort of thing, don'tyou?
Don't make a sound.
Nah.
They won't help you.
I'd kill them.
You knowthat.
There's no one here that can stop me.
I'll kill her and and them.
I'll kill him and her and her.
And it'll all be your fault.
Kinda funny, isn't it?
All these people here and no one who can do a thing, not a person who can help you.
But that's people for ya.
They're pretty worthless.
But Keys, on the other hand, Keys are worth a very lot.
You lying little tramp.
You're not the Key.
You're nothing.
Just another worthless human being!
I hate being lied to.
It makes me feel so betrayed.
You wanna make it all better?
If you tell me who the Key really is, I'll letyou go.
Think about it.
You think your hand hurts?
Imagine whatyou'd feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain.
It doesn't kill you.
What it does is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room, naked and ashamed.
And there are things in the dark that need to hurtyou because you're bad.
Little pinching things that go in your ears and crawl on the inside of your skull.
And you know, if the noise and the crawling would stop, thatyou could remember howto get out.
Butyou never, ever will.
Who is the Key?
Fine.
Let's get crazy.
Tara!
Tara!
By the force of heart and mindful power, by waning time at the waxing hour, I when I decree What is it?
What is it?
No!
No!
that she I love must now be free!
Tara!
No!
Tara?
Tara, are you OK?
It's dirty.
It's all dirty.
And all over me.
Dirty.
Dirty.
I'm bad.
Bad.
Tara!
Tara, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry.
Can't she go home now?
Unfortunately, no.
Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night.
But does she have to?
I can take care of her at home.
It's poisoned.
Why did I tell you that?
It has to be checked, though.
- She your sister?
- It has to be verified.
Anyone can tell you that.
Of course.
Of course, of course.
She's my everything.
You can get her released in the morning.
But she must spend one night in the psych ward.
Just for observation.
We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple of basic tests, then you take her home.
Does that sound fair?
Well, sit tight, then, and I'll send a nurse by in few minutes to pick up Tara.
Man, words cannot express how much I hate this place.
- It's dreadful.
- It's like communism.
Will, I'm so sorry.
They kill mice.
Tara.
I'm sorry it took me so long.
But Dawn's safe with Spike, so I can stay as long as you need.
- I'm so scared.
- Nothin' to be worried about, kid.
No one's gonna hurtyou.
Oh, yeah?
The same "no one" who did that to you?
What, these?
It's just a few bruises.
Nothin' to write home about.
Hey, chin up, platelet.
And don't get scared.
Maybe Glory doesn't wanna kill you.
Maybe it's something Worse?
- Hey.
- You wanna know what I'm scared of, Spike?
Me.
Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the Key.
But I'm the Key, Spike.
I am.
And anything that happens to Tara is cos of me.
Your bruises, your limp that's all me, too.
I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt.
And everyone around me suffers and dies.
I must be something so horrible to cause so much pain and evil.
Rot.
What do you know?
I'm a vampire.
I know somethin' about evil.
You're not evil.
Maybe I'm not evil.
But I don't think I can be good.
Well, I'm not good, and I'm OK.
Don't!
Please don't with that treachery!
I told the cats.
And now I beg my mother sitting all alone.
Bye, Tara.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you.
Willow.
No.
It's just for one night.
Yeah, I know, but it's a whole night.
I don't think I can sleep without her.
You can sleep with me.
Well, now, that came out a lot more lesbian than it sounded in my head.
Will, you just have to rest.
OK?
Right nowthere's nothing you can do.
Yes, there is.
No.
No way.
You cannot even think about taking on Glory.
You saw what she did.
I can't let her get away with it.
No.
You have to let her get away with it.
Even I'm no match for her.
You knowthat.
- But maybe I am.
- You're not.
And I won't letyou go.
This is notyour choice.
It's mine.
This is not the time.
When, Buffy?
When is?
When youfeel like it?
When it's someone you love as much as I love Tara?
When it's Dawn?
Is that it?
When we have a chance.
We'll fight her when we have a chance.
You wouldn't last five minutes with her, Willow.
She's a god.
Fine.
I'll wait.
It's the only way.
Yeah.
- Can I do anything?
- Just let me be alone.
You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch!
What a mind she had!
Mmm, nummy treat!
- But is Your Grace not concerned about - What, about the Slayer?
Don't be stupid.
I know I'm closing in.
The Key's as good as mine.
A girl like Buffy's got just so many friends.
All I gotta do is rip through 'em one by one, until I finally Did anybody order an apocalypse?
Kali, Hera, Cronus, Tonic.
Air like nectar, thick as onyx.
- Cassiel, by your second star - Ah.
It's the lover.
- That's so cute.
- hold mine victim as in tar.
I owe you pain!
- It's all my fault.
- No.
Sweetheart, it is notyour fault.
How's Willow?
She was looking to go all payback-y on Glory for a minute.
But I cooled her down, a little.
Actually, a lot.
So she's not gonna do anything rash, then?
No.
I explained there was no point.
What?
So you're saying that a powerful and mightily pissed-off witch was plannin' on going and spillin' herself a few pints of god blood until you what?
"Explained"?
You think she'd?
No.
I told Willow it would be like suicide.
I'd do it.
Right person.
Person I loved.
I'd do it.
Think, Buffy, if Glory had done that to me.
Shatter.
Is that it?
Is that the bestyou can do?
You think I care about all this?
The apartment, the clothes?
Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?
That was something to treasure.
What's this?
Bag of tricks?
Bag of knives.
Spirit of serpents, now appear.
Hissing, writhing, striking near.
Nowthis is getting weak.
And so are you, honey.
Aren'tya?
No!
You know what they used to do to witches, lover?
Crucify 'em.
They used to bow down to gods.
Things change.
That witch really slowed me down.
- Thicken.
- This isn't over, you hear me?
It isn't over!
- Chicken salad?
- Right here.
Eggplant, that's me.
Salami with peanut butter?
Dawn.
Yeah, like eggplant is normal.
It's what, half egg, half plant?
Cos that's just a natural.
What's Tara got?
I got her tuna.
Does she like Tara?
Plastic and their six sisters.
Six sick sisters.
- Willow?
- It's OK.
Let's just start slowtoday.
Buffy, could I have that?
Here you go.
That's my girl.
Can I help?
What are you gonna need?
I don't know.
They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.
They said I might have to restrain her at night.
But sometimes she's fine.
She looks at me and she's fine.
- I'm sorry I couldn't - It's OK.
I can do this.
I'm gonna take care of her.
Even if she never She's my girl.
I understand.
I know you do.
Hear that, baby?
You're my always.
- I told you this wasn't over.
- No.
The place is cracking!
It's cracking!
Cracking!
No, no!
No, Tara, it's OK.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Oh, the light!
Oh, it's so pure.
Such pure green energy.
Oh, it's so beautiful.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Previously on "Buffy The Vampire Slayer": We had to hide the Key.
- Made it human and sent it to you.
- Dawn.
- What kind of demon am lfighting?
- Glory isn't a demon.
She's a god.
Your sister took my Key and she won't give it back.
I betyou know where she put it.
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the Key to her in the form of a sister".
You're the Key.
Go.
Before she finds you.
She's here.
I love you.
The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
Let's see whatyou are.
Or who you are.
One soldier in a vast army.
The Key is the link.
The link must be severed.
- Where is the Key?
- I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
No.
No.
Tara.
No.
Tara, I'm so sorry.
- What are you gonna need?
- They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.
- I told you this wasn't over.
- Oh, look at that.
Such pure green energy.
Vozdukh, priyevratis v kulak.
- Buffy.
- Keep moving.
I can't.
I really hate it when people touch my things.
- Last words, slay-runt?
- Just one.
Truck.
- No.
Not now, you idiot.
- Let go of my body.
Oh, God.
And then, whoosh!
All of a sudden Glory's standing in front of us, skanky and blonde and thinkin' she's all that cos some bumpy heads kiss her stinky feet She does have nice feet.
She's coming at us and Buffy's standing there, not even blinking, like "Bring it on" and wham!
- Hell-bitch in orbit.
- Go, Buff.
I knew you'd best Glory.
Our years of training A truck hit her.
You threw it at her?
Well, no.
She more kind of waited for it to hit Glory.
But then Buffy ran really fast and we got away.
I don't know how.
That truck couldn't have slowed her down for more than a second.
Well, how isn't important.
All that matters is that the two of you are safe.
Safe?
We've barely managed not getting seriously dead every time we've crossed paths.
Nowthat she knows that Dawn is the Key?
There must be something in the Book of Tarnis that we can use against Glory.
Piano.
Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that one time.
No, that was a rocket launcher.
What are you talkin' about?
We should drop a piano on her.
It works for that cartoon rabbit running from that nice man with the speech impediment.
Or we could paint a convincing tunnel on the side of a mountain.
Let's just keep thinking.
- We'll reassemble at the magic shop, see if - Can't fight her.
- Well, notyet, no - No, not ever.
She's too strong, Giles.
We won't win this with stakes, or spells, or pulling out some uranium power core.
She's a god and she's coming for us.
So let's not be here when she knocks.
Run away?
Finally, a sensible plan.
That's not what she meant.
Is it?
We can't stay here.
She'll just kill us one by one till there's no one between her and Dawn.
We understand the severity of this, but there must be another No.
We stay, we die.
Show of hands for that option?
All right.
Nobody goes home, nobody tells anybody we're leaving.
Just pack whatever supplies we need and we're gone.
Cool.
Don't have to study for that geometry test.
What about wheels?
I don't think everybody'll fit in the Xandermobile.
Just getyour stuff together.
I'll handle the rest.
This is terrible.
I'll never be able to mend this.
- Not really my colour, anyway.
- Oh, yes.
Inappropriate humour.
Most amusing.
Don't suppose you know what led to this sartorial tragedy.
- That's not how it works.
- Yes.
Of course.
I just thought maybe after Her Magnificent Incandescence was returned to this manly and painfully handsome assemblage, you might have noticed something interesting.
A Key in human form, perhaps?
Lounging about unattended?
- If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
- Why do you fight the inevitable?
No one can stand against Her Blindingly Scrumptious Luminescence.
Glory.
Her name is Glory, and she's your god, you little scab, not mine.
With all due respect and fear of sharp objects, you exist, sir, only because of Her Divine Greatness.
You mean Her Divine Failure, don'tyou?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be normal.
We play the hand we're dealt.
Nothing's mine, is it?
This life, this body, it's all infected.
The only thing I've ever cared about, she's taken away from me.
- You know why I wanted to be a doctor?
- Flattering drawstring pants?
To be close to people.
To witness their lives and their deaths, to be there alongside them, a part of everyday humanity.
- Maybe it's the drugs.
- Drugs, sir?
Find the right combination, keep her buried.
Impossible.
Her Magnificence can never be fully contained.
She is a perfect, all-encompassing light, one you should feel honoured to be bathed in.
I'm thrilled.
Especially with the part where she gets her Key back and I cease to exist.
True, this oh-so-appealing form will of necessity be shrugged off.
- Not if I get the Key first.
- And if you did, what then?
Could you do it?
Take a human life with your own hands?
Oblivion is such a small inconvenience in the service of a deity.
Acceptyour fate.
I mean, you said ityourself.
This life was never really yours anyway, was it?
It doesn't matter how I came by it.
It's mine.
And I plan on keeping it.
- Anybody else feel that?
- What?
- Cold draught of paralysing fear.
- We just need to stay calm.
- Calm.
Right.
- We gotta be like Sergeant Rock.
Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds.
Overwhelming?
How much more than whelming would that be exactly?
Everything will be all right, we just need to stay here calmly.
As soon as Buffy arrives we'll feel oddly worse.
- What's he doing here?
- Just out for a jaunt.
- Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
- Out.
- He's here because we need him.
- The hell we do.
He's the only one besides me with any chance of protecting Dawn.
- Buffy, come on - Look, this isn't a discussion.
He stays.
Get over it.
Buckle up, kids.
Daddy's puttin' the hammer down.
Sign here.
OK, that should do it.
See?
Did I not tell you how easy it would be for us to My pen.
The trees are singing water.
- You have him.
- Yes, General.
- Our brother has returned to the fold.
- Welcome home, Orlando.
I swear by my sword your sacrifice will not go unavenged.
Shiny.
Yes, I suppose it is.
Pretty little girl, she's shiny too.
Watch him, make sure he's comfortable.
So shiny.
Pretty little shiny Key.
The Key?
You've seen it?
Pretty little shiny girl.
The monks, they've made it human.
We knowthe Slayer's protecting the Key.
If what Orlando says is true - Prepare to advance.
- Yes, sir.
We end this now.
Shouldn't somebody be asking "Are we there yet"?
Isn't that what small irritating children do?
That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
Do we know where we're going yet?
We'd be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke would give up the wheel.
Gramps, bloody step on it.
Step on what?
I've driven tricycles with more power.
- Is anybody else queasy?
- He doesn't travel well.
He's like fine shrimp.
I should've nicked that Porsche.
There's just enough room for me, you, and big sis.
- What?
- Would you give it a rest, or - Or you'll toss your cookies on my shoes?
- Or you can be undead man walking.
See howfastyou can hitch a ride with a flaming thumb.
Fine.
Shrimp.
That guy is bloodsuckin' the last nerve outta me.
Well, Buffy has a point.
In a confrontation, Spike may prove useful.
I don't know if Buffy's thinkin' too clear on that one, or anything else right now.
- I've never seen her so - She's been through more than her fair share.
She just needs a chance to catch her breath, regroup.
- She'll be all right.
- Yeah.
She'll Yeah.
Any luck?
If you define luck as the absence of success, plenty.
There's a couple of barrier spells, but they only work on fixed locus.
I haven't found anything that'll work while we're moving.
So pretty.
Can I have one?
Come on.
- Anyone hungry?
- Snacks.
The secret to any successful migration.
Who's up for some tasty fried meat products?
Tara, no.
What did I tell you?
I'm sorry.
She didn't mean to.
She doesn't know what she's doing.
- We know.
- No biggie.
The skin's already stopped smokin'.
You go ahead and play peekaboo with Mr Sunshine all you like.
Keeps the ride from getting boring.
All the light's gone.
No, baby.
The light's still outside, OK?
All dark.
All dark.
- Dark.
- All dark.
Soon.
Soon.
Soon.
It's coming.
The signs are in alignment.
Soon victory will be in our grasp.
All we need do is seize the moment and squeeze until it bleeds.
Hey.
I thinkAnya's gonna try to cook.
Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
Maybe later.
Thanks.
For what?
You know.
Pretty much everything.
Yeah.
I'm doin' a great job.
You are.
I'm the Slayer.
The Chosen One.
All mythic and defender-y.
Evil nasties are supposed to flee from me.
Not the other way around.
You're not fleeing.
You're moving at a brisk pace.
Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the big scaredy runaway.
It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
It just keeps coming.
Glory, Riley, Tara, Mom.
I know.
But there's a bright side.
- There is?
- At least things can't get any crazier.
Right?
You knowthis is your fault for saying that.
Armando.
Bring up the ranks.
Advance.
- Giles.
- I see them.
See who?
Arrows.
They're throwing arrows.
Dawn, get down under the table.
Horsies.
Tara.
- Weapons?
- Hello.
You're driving one.
- Don't hit the horsies.
- We won't.
Aim for the horsies.
Did we shake 'em?
Stay low.
Watch out for Now might be a good time for something heroic.
Xander.
Hatch.
Up.
- Keep the pressure on.
- I always do, sweet bit.
Not a piano, but hey.
Everyone all right?
- We gotta find shelter.
- Yeah, bloody quick.
I'm burnin' up out here.
Careful.
Spike.
Careful.
Up.
- OK.
Will?
- I'm on it.
Careful.
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah.
But Spike's hurt.
- Easy with the delicates.
- They'll heal.
Florence bloody Nightingale to the rescue.
You have a plan, right?
One that doesn't involve pointy knives and a Winnebago?
We'll rest here for a minute, then we have to move.
- Where?
- I don't know.
We can't stay here.
It's too close to the wreck.
We're too easy to find.
- Buffy.
- Will, how is he?
- Will?
- I think I've slowed the bleeding, but OK, just give me a minute.
Dawn, get down.
We got company.
And they brought a crusade.
- Willow.
- I'm working on it.
Go.
Come on, let's move.
Come on, move it.
Buffy.
The Key.
Enemies, fly and fall.
Circling arms, raise a wall.
They have the General.
Clerics.
- Energy barrier.
A most powerful one.
- Can it be breached?
The witch's magic pales to the might of our god.
The infidel's wall shall tumble before us.
Will?
How long will it hold?
Half a day, maybe.
Or until Heckle and Jeckle punch a hole through it.
So, what's the story with these role-playing rejects?
Let's find out.
You sure Scarface can hablathe English?
He understands me.
Don'tyou?
- You were warned we would return, Slayer.
- Took you long enough.
What are you supposed to be, some kind of chief?
General.
In charge of what, getting captured?
You do not frighten me, child.
The instrument of chaos must be destroyed.
Look at her that way again, and she will be the last thing you ever see.
As I've been told, you protect the Key of the Beast.
- It's not that simple.
- Yes.
The Key has been transformed, given breath, life.
Yet this makes no difference.
The Key is the link.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.
She doesn't remember anything about being this Key you're all looking for.
The only thing she remembers is growing up with a mother and a sister that love her.
What kind of god would demand her life for something that she has no control over?
We are notyour enemy.
Tell your men to stand down.
No.
It is not her fault.
She's human now.
The Key is too dangerous to be allowed to exist, no matter what form it has been pressed into.
I will not let anyone tell me - What happened?
- I don't know.
She just went nuts.
Time.
Time.
Time.
Tara?
Tara.
We have to do something.
She can't just stay this way.
- Buffy.
- Time.
Time.
Time.
Time.
Time.
No, it's not time for your med.
Just lie back and - Doctor.
Doctor McCarthy.
- Time.
- It's time.
- No.
There's nothing to fear, my brother.
The Beast may have taken your mind, but I swear to you, she will never knowthe taste of your heart.
Clerics.
I want the witch's barrier down.
Now.
- I'm sorry.
- What for?
We should've stayed.
If we had, none of this would have happened.
Don't.
Whatyou did was necessary.
What I've always admired.
Running away?
Being able to place your heart above all else.
I'm so proud of you.
You've come so far.
You're everything a watcher everything I could have hoped for.
Willow.
Open a door.
Speak.
- My friend was hurt when you attacked us.
- Ten of my men are dead.
Honourable men.
Shall we balance the scale?
Will you let someone come and help him or not?
Give quarter to an agent of the Beast?
What madness would move me to such action?
- I'm done asking.
- Whoa.
This is war, isn't it?
And if there's one thing I've learned from Sergeant Rock, it is in war, there are rules.
Or at least there should be, if you're as honourable as you think you are.
Plus, we do have your General Forehead Guy.
Discharge and bring life.
Handier than a Swiss knife.
Look, the door to my crypt's got this nasty squeak, maybe you could Hey.
It's Buffy.
I need to ask you a really big favour.
You forgot to mention the costume party outside.
Sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.
No, it's OK.
I mean, yeah, not how I pictured seeing you again, but I'll take what I can get.
Thank you for coming.
My pleasure.
I think I got him stabilised, but there's a lot of damage.
We need to get him outta here.
I thinkthe guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas.
Don't they always.
I knowthis must seem extra Outer Limitsto you.
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
You know, emergency room, full moon on a Saturday night.
Look, if this gets too weird, just tell me.
I'll understand.
Don't worry about me.
I won't leave until I've worn out my welcome.
Thanks.
You know, those things'll kill you.
Oh.
Right.
I mention today how much I don't like you?
Might've let it slip in once or twice.
How're your feelers?
It's nothing compared to the little bits we'll get chopped into when they kickthe door in.
- And here we bloody sit.
- It's not like we got much of a choice.
We could make a break for it.
Use General Armour-All as a shield, get to the doc's car Great plan.
While all the hacking and slashing's goin' on, what are you gonna do?
- Throw migraines at 'em?
- Look, we stay here, we all die.
- At least this way, some of us might get - No.
We're all gonna make it.
I'm not losing anyone.
Checkthe supplies.
See if anyone's hungry.
Dissension in the ranks.
Seldom a harbinger of glad tidings.
Shut up.
Poor frightened girl.
You've no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
- Why don'tyou tell me?
- Would it make a difference?
What do you know of the Beast?
Strong.
Fast.
Hell god.
- From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
- A demon dimension.
I know.
She ruled with two other Hell gods.
They were a triumvirate of suffering and despair.
Ruling with equal vengeance.
But the Beast's power grew beyond even what they could conceive.
As did her lust for pain and misery.
They looked upon her, what she had become, and trembled.
- A god afraid?
- Such was her power.
They feared she would attempt to seize their dimension for herself, and decided to strike first.
A great battle erupted.
In the end, they stood victorious over the Beast.
Barely.
She was cast out.
Banished to this lower plane of existence, forced to live and eventually die trapped within the body of a mortal.
A newborn male, created as her prison.
That is the Beast's only weakness.
Kill the man and the god dies.
Unfortunately, the identity of the human vessel has never been discovered.
I don't understand.
I've seen Glory.
Not a lot goin' on in the hairy-chest department.
You have seen a glimpse of the true Beast.
Her power was too great to be contained.
She's found a way to escape her mortal prison for brief periods before her energies are exhausted and she's forced back into her cell of meat and bone.
What about me?
- What about the Key?
- Dawn.
- I want to know.
- The Key is almost as old as the Beast itself.
Where it came from, how it was created: the deepest of mysteries.
All that is certain is that its power is absolute.
Countless generations of my people have sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath could be unleashed.
- But the monks found it first.
- Yes, and hid it with their magics.
Why didn't they just destroy it?
If it's so dangerous They were fools.
They thought they could harness its power for the forces of light.
They failed, and paid with their blood.
What do I do?
What was I created for?
You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
The Beast will use your power to return home and seize control of the Hell she was banished from.
That's it?
That's Glory's master plan?
To go home?
You misunderstand.
Once the Key is activated, it won't just open the gates to the Beast's dimension.
It's going to open all the gates.
The walls separating realities will crumble.
Dimensions will bleed into each other.
Order will be overthrown and the universe will tumble into chaos.
All dark.
For ever.
That is whatyou were created for.
Dawn.
You think it's true?
What he said?
I don't know.
Destroyer of the universe.
Guess cutting school doesn't seem so bad now.
It's notyou.
You knowthat.
But it's in me, isn't it?
It's inside me.
What are we gonna do?
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.
Wriggling.
Come on, Tara, you have to eat something.
- Want me to try?
- I don't know.
I'm gettin' used to pickin' food out of my hair.
You.
You are not a part of this, are you?
- Just a friend of the family.
- Would you die for them?
That is what will happen if you align yourself with the Slayer and her misguided people.
It's my life, and I'll do what I please with it.
It's not justyour life.
Unimaginable legions will perish, including everyone here.
You can stop this.
You can save all their lives by ending one.
The little girl.
The Key.
Destroy it, and the will of the Beast will be broken, she will fade.
A distant memory.
And all of this madness will end.
- Sorry.
- Is - Is he gonna be OK?
- He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.
It's because of me.
- It's all my fault.
- No, it isn't.
You don't know what's happening.
I don't have to.
I just knowthat sometimes terrible things happen to good people.
It shouldn't, but it does.
It's nobody's fault.
It's just the way life is.
Is that gonna help?
Ben?
- You have to let me out.
- Ben?
- I gotta get out.
Open a door now.
- What happened?
- I don't know, he just freaked out.
- Let me out.
- OK.
Will, open a door.
- No.
What do you know?
Little Ben finally did something right.
The Beast.
Hey, it's Gregor.
Now it's not.
Buffy.
- The Beast.
Prepare to attack.
- Great.
Attack.
Dawn.
Willow.
Get it down, now.
Hear my plea.
Circling arms protecting me.
We have to The Beast.
The car.
Get the keys.
Buffy, we have to find Dawn.
We can't let Glory Buffy.
Buffy.
Buffy, you have to get up.
We need you.
Buffy, please.
Buffy
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - So it's her.
Under our noses all this time.
- Glorificus will find the witch.
- Witch?
- Tara.
- You're not the Key, you're nothing.
- No.
Tara.
- I'm so sorry.
- They kill mice.
- Not if I get the Key first.
- Could you do it?
Take a human life with your own hands?
I told you this wasn't over.
Such pure green energy.
The Key.
Just packthe supplies we need and that's it - we're gone.
- Giles.
- I see them.
- Buffy.
- How is he?
Will?
He's stabilised, but there's a lot of damage.
We need to get him out.
We got company.
The Key.
Once the Key is activated, the walls separating realities will crumble.
Dimensions will bleed into each other.
I won't let anything happen to you.
- Let me out.
- Will, open a door.
No.
- Buffy.
- Dawn.
Buffy, you have to get up.
Buffy, please.
Buffy.
Quickly.
Already we're behind schedule.
Someone's bound for a beheading.
Let's make sure it's not me.
Why do we remain when our moment of triumph lies so close-at-hand?
The Glorious One, having acquired much in this world, doesn't exactly travel lightly.
Minions, I can hear you.
Godlike ears don't miss much, you know what I'm sayin'?
Come here.
- He blasphemed, Magnificence.
- Spurred by treacherous urging.
Guys.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Not in the mood.
What do you thinkthat's about?
- In mercy does your power lie?
- No, brainless.
In torture, death and chaos does my power lie.
So tell me, why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?
- Maybe I'm just hungry.
- Yes, we shall fetch a lovely No, I'm not hungry.
I'm just a little tight in this skin, is all.
I've been waiting an eternity well, 25 human years.
And it all comes down to tonight.
- The portal shall open - And the great Glorificus shall return to the Hell I came from, where I'm gonna rain down more supersized portions of slaughter, mayhem and bloodshed than any of you scabs can even dream about.
So, how come I ain't happy?
Got everything I ever wanted.
Still, something's off.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Better part of a century spent in delinquency just paid off.
Hot-wired Ben's auto.
- Who's for gettin' the hell out?
- All in favour.
Let's do it.
- You good to go?
- Don't worry about me.
- How's Buffy?
- The same.
- Still.
- It's been almost a half an hour.
Slayer's gonna be all right, won't she?
You should try again, Will.
All right, but I'm not even sure she's, you know, really in there.
Try.
Can you hear me?
Buffy.
Buffy.
She can't just be braindead.
I mean, she's still Buffy, somewhere in there, right?
Spike, we won't get Dawn back by sittin' here.
You won't any way you slice it.
That's for Buffy to decide.
Good, panic.
That oughta help.
We should move her.
Unless we shouldn't.
Should we?
Couldn't that make it worse?
I think I've read that somewhere.
I am so large with not knowing.
It's impossible to knowfor sure.
Losing Dawn, after all that Buffy's been through It's pushed her too far, into a sort of catatonia.
You don't need a diploma to see that.
Snap her out of it.
Buffy.
- Rise and shine, love.
- Spike.
Come on, people.
Girl's endowed with slayer strength.
Hardly time to get dainty.
Buffy.
We tried that.
We didn't try that.
Are you insane?
This could be neurological damage.
- You wanna kill her?
- We have to do something.
I can't just sit watching.
You waste time with kid gloves.
I'll wager, when all's said and done, Buffy likes it rough.
Separate.
Buffy's out.
Glory has Dawn.
Some time real soon, she's gonna use Dawn to tear down the barrier between every dimension there is.
So, if you two wanna fight, you do it after the world ends, OK?
All right.
First we head backto Sunnydale.
Xander'll take Giles to a hospital.
Anya's looking after Tara.
And Spike, you find Glory.
Check her apartment, see if she's still there.
Try anything stupid, like payback, and I will get very cranky.
Everyone clear?
Anya.
What will you do?
- I'll help Buffy.
- OK, then.
The world is spinning.
Straight to a new day.
Big day.
Will?
Now don't turn me into a horned toad for asking, but what if we come across Ben?
I don't think a doctor's what Buffy needs right now.
Well, yeah, especially not one who also happens to be Glory.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
Ben is Glory.
You mean, Ben's with Glory?
- "With" in what sense?
- They're working together?
No.
Ben is Glory.
Glory's Ben.
They're one and the same.
- Well, when did all this happen?
- Not one hour ago.
Right here, before your very eyes.
Ben came, turned into Glory, snatched the kid and vanished, remember?
You do remember?
Is everyone here very stoned?
Ben.
Glory.
He's a doctor, she's the Beast.
Two entirely separate entities sharing one body.
It's like a bloody sitcom.
Surely you remember.
- So you're saying Ben and Glory - Have a connection.
Yes, obviously, but what kind?
I get it.
That's very crafty.
Glory's worked the kind of mojo where anyone who sees her little presto-change-o instantly forgets.
And yours truly, being somewhat other than human, stands immune.
So, Ben and Glory are the same person?
Glory can turn into Ben, and Ben turns back into Glory.
And anyone who sees it instantly forgets.
And a kewpie doll for the lady.
Excellent.
Now.
Do we suspect that there may be some kind of connection between Ben and Glory?
The Key.
Unbelievable how annoying the groupies can be.
They merely sense that tonight the dimensional portal shall open Ushering in the long and bloody reign of the great What's he doing?
I must anoint the Key.
Really, don't.
Go.
- But - Get out.
You know, you recapture your godhood and unleash Armageddon, all of a sudden everybody wants to be a part of the inner circle.
You OK?
I wanna go home.
Sweetie You're about to.
Not that fake suburban nightmare the monks cooked up.
Your real home.
As the Key.
You fit in a lock.
Well, it's like a lock.
You want a pizza?
No.
Pillow?
I don't know if this thing gets cable.
Doubtful.
Please.
Stop.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
I know how you feel.
It is your last night.
As, you know, a human.
This body?
It's just a rental, Dawnie.
Being human?
It's like a costume for girls like you and me.
Being something else, that's what we are.
Don't.
- What?
- Don't call me Dawnie.
Wow.
You know, that actually hurt my feelings.
- I'm sorry.
- Not the point.
I'm just thinking, I'm trying to make you feel better, when comforting others not part of my life.
And I'm doing it so I can stop feeling so - Help me out.
- Guilty?
Guilty.
That's it.
But I'm not supposed to feel guilty.
I'm not supposed to feel anything.
I'm a god.
I'm above it.
I'm You.
You did this to me, didn'tyou?
Some sort of spell.
You've been hanging with the Wicca, you could've But no.
Not magic.
It's something else.
Still, it is you doing this.
I'm not doing anything.
I swear.
We'll see.
Anoint this thing now.
You know what they're all chanting for out there, Dawnie?
Blood.
Cos we found outyour blood is the key to the Key.
All I gotta do is bleed you dry, the portal opens up, and I can go home.
So knock yourself out, girlfriend.
Make me feel bad as you can.
Cos tomorrow you bleed, little girl.
- You sure you know whatyou're doing?
- I think so.
I don't know.
It's not exactly well-explored territory, but I gotta try.
A spell like this could be really dangerous for Buffy.
And you.
Time.
Time is coming.
It's OK.
I'm here.
- You'll look after her while I'm - Sure.
What do I do?
Mostly just be here for her.
There's some pills in my knapsack.
Half of one every two hours keeps her pretty mellow.
You think you'll be gone more than two hours?
- Wish me luck?
- OK.
Good luck.
Thanks.
OK.
Be good now, sweetie.
I'll be back as soon as I can, OK?
We're good?
Good luck.
Hi, Willow.
Hello, Buffy.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I'm looking for you.
Do you like dolls?
- Buffy, what are you doing here?
- I like it here.
Butyou know we need you.
You have to come out.
- Why?
- To be with your friends.
It's a big day for me.
- Hello.
- Mommy, Daddy.
- You're back.
- Hello, Buffy.
How's my girl?
Are you ready to meetyour new baby sister?
Come on now, Buffy.
She's nothing to be afraid of.
- Who's afraid?
- Don'tyou want to be the big sister?
- No.
I want to be the baby.
- Buffy.
You're gonna pay more attention to her and forget all about me.
Doesn't she look funny?
Like a wrinkly old grandpa.
Like this.
OK, support the head.
There you go.
We're calling her Dawn.
Dawn.
I could be the one to look after her sometimes, if you need a helper.
Mom, can I take care of her?
Yes, Buffy, you can take care of her.
OK.
Can you There.
How you doin'?
It only hurts while I answer pointless questions.
Where's Buffy?
Willow's on it.
Or in it.
She's workin' some spell, trying to reach Buffy psychically.
She's gone into Buffy's mind?
- Pretty trippy stuff.
- It's extraordinarily advanced.
I was thinking we should check on Glory's victims while we're here.
The mental ward?
I already been.
The vegetable section's closed.
It's like they all just got up and walked away.
I checked out Glory's flat.
Looks like the great one has scampered.
Gone to perform her ritual with Dawn and leaving us entirely clueless.
Not entirely.
I knowthis bloke.
Well, not so much a bloke so much as demon.
But still, bookish.
All tuned in to the nastier corners of this, our magic world.
It's a bit of a last resort really, but still, we might persuade him to suss out Glory's game plan.
Sound worthy?
Off we go, then.
Meet back at the shop?
I found Ben's room at Glory's.
Didn't learn much.
Wait.
Ben?
At Glory's?
You're saying all this time he's been subletting from her?
This is gonna be worth it.
Last time.
From the top.
- I'm hating this, Murk.
- This would be what exactly, Your Holiness?
Memories.
I'm starting to remember the things Ben did.
People he spoke with, stuff he wore Kid.
I came He came to see you, didn't he?
- Ben?
- Yeah, Ben.
You called him to the desert when you were hiding from me.
And he came.
- And then he was me, you remember?
- Yes.
See?
She's not supposed to remember that.
Nobody should.
The cloak between Ben and me is fading.
I almost helped her.
He I wanted to.
I can't do this.
- Get him out of me.
- What?
Ben.
The human meat sack who's infecting me.
Do your mojo, make an incision, or removal, or whatever you gotta do.
Help me.
I'm thinking Ben's thoughts, and I'm feeling his feelings.
And I Can't kill the girl.
Damn it.
- Help me.
- This I cannot do.
You riskterrible magics in opening the portal.
Nothing comes without a price.
This is yours.
Gods don't pay.
We do this now.
I know you.
You're the first original Slayer who tried killing us all in our dreams.
- How've you been?
- Death is your gift.
- Death is my gift?
- Wait.
Death is her what?
Death is your gift.
Where are you going?
Glorificus, wait.
Kill the Key now and all will be lost.
We'll be stuck on this mortal plane for ever.
All right, you're right.
It's cool.
I'm just a little emotional right now which, if you're into irony, funny.
Leave.
We need a little girl time.
Goodbye.
How do they do it?
- Do what?
- People.
How do they function in the world with all this bile running through them?
Every day it's "Whoo-hoo"!
You have no control.
They're not even animals.
They're just meatbaggy slaves to hormones and pheromones and their feelings.
Hate 'em.
I mean, really.
Is this what the poets go on about?
This?
Call me crazy, but as hard-core drugs go, human emotion is just useless.
People are puppets.
Everyone getting jerked around by what they're feeling.
Am I wrong?
Really, I wanna know.
Gonna bleed you either way.
- Depends on the person.
- So you're saying some people like this.
- Some.
- Funny.
Cos I look at this world you're so eager to be a part of, and all I see is six billion lunatics looking for the fastest ride out.
Who's not crazy?
Look around.
Everyone's drinking, smoking, shooting up, shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out cos they don't want 'em any more.
I'm crazy?
Honey, I'm the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind.
Cos at least I admit the world makes me nuts.
Name one person who can take it here.
That's all I'm asking.
Name one.
Buffy.
I can't keep following you around like this, Buffy.
We have to go.
You have to talkto me.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Death is my gift.
Yeah.
I keep hearing that, but I'm not exactly sure what it means.
It's really not that complicated.
Not for you, maybe.
It's what I do.
I mean, come on.
You've known me for how long?
It's what I'm here for.
It's all I am.
Buffy, stop.
No.
God, no.
What?
I keep telling you, Will.
I figured it out.
Death is my gift.
Ben, this is really not a good time.
Dawn.
Has Glory hurtyou?
No.
Notyet.
But I have to get out of here.
Ben?
Are you OK?
Where is it?
- Where's what?
- All the blood.
I can feel it, still warm and wet.
Glory.
Oh, God.
She slaughtered hundreds of men.
But I can feel them breaking.
Ben, something is happening to both you and Glory.
I'm rememberin' her, aren't I?
The things she's done.
Things she's going to do.
I know.
She told me.
I think, whatever the magic is that keeps you guys apart is starting to break down.
Ben, Glory could come back any minute.
- How could she do this?
- I don't know.
- We have to get out of here and find Buffy - No!
I mean, I have a job.
I have a life!
And Glory?
She never once thinks about me in all this.
- Help me.
- How?
Highness.
- Please.
- Is everything all right?
You're not I'll take you as far as I can, ditch you before she's back.
OK, now, this is weird.
Hi, Willow.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I'm looking for you.
Here.
Again.
- Do you like dolls?
- No.
And I think we already déjà'd this vu.
- You talk funny.
- Yes.
As you'll tell me again when we're older and in chem class.
- Buffy, what are we doing here?
- Don'tyou like it here?
We don't have time.
- Mommy, Daddy.
- We're home.
- You're back.
- Hi, Buffy.
We're calling her Dawn.
I could be the one to look after her sometimes.
It's always open.
What can I do for you boys?
Want some cocoa?
- No.
We need information.
We need - Ben's Glory.
- Who's what?
- Look at this.
Special Ed remembers.
Yeah.
I do.
Ben's Glory and Glory's Ben.
It's like this fog's lifted.
Wonderful.
But not why we're here.
Hell-god type.
Name of Glory - AKA Ben.
- has gone missing.
She's brewing up some major-league bad, and she's nicked the Slayer's kid sister.
That girl you brought here.
Sweet little thing.
How'd things work out with her mom?
Changed her mind, didn't she?
Yeah.
You got any idea where Glory would take her?
Glory.
You don't mean Glorificus?
Gosh.
What do you wanna get mixed up with her for?
That's a sure way to getyourselves killed.
I hear she's awfully unpleasant.
When it comes to Hell gods, my best advice is get out of the way, and stay there.
Love to.
Can't.
Well, other than that I'd like to help, but I'm a small-town guy.
This Glorificus, if it is her, she's big city.
- She's got Dawn.
- Right.
Well, I may know a fella, you know, who knows a fella in China.
He might Howthe hell are we to get to China?
Teleport?
I guess.
You know, if you're in that much of a hurry.
Wish you luck.
You're lying.
And what's more, I believe you're standing right in front of the very thing we need.
Idiot.
Get him.
You think only underworld bottom feeders worship the Beast?
Her day is coming, boys.
And when she returns, then you're gonna see somethin'.
- What have we got?
- Something worth dying for.
Buffy, will you just stop a second and listen to me?
- Buffy.
You have to stop doing this.
- Doing what?
- Killing Dawn.
- Why?
Because this never happened.
You never killed your sister.
- Will, I did this.
- In your imagination.
None of this is real.
You're stuck in some kinda loop.
I don't know whatyou're talking about.
Excuse me.
Buffy, why are you doing this?
I thinkthey see us.
Stay close to me.
Don't look back.
Stay very still.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
That actually hurt, you prepubescent puke.
OK, first thought, just totally spontaneous, unfiltered, off the top of my head You hit Ben in his soft human head, and I remember the pain.
You probably think I won't waste any precious blood of yours till tonight.
You're right.
But I know a thousand ways to hurtyou that won't spill a drop.
You knowthose pesky feelings I've been having?
Guilt, empathy?
I'm gonna take 'em and mash 'em back down where they belong, OK?
Now.
Let's have big-girl fun.
Justyou and Leave her alone.
I said, leave her alone.
No.
Little late in the game to grow a backbone, Benjamin.
Now be good and stay quiet.
No, you don't.
Get over yourself, Ben.
This is the way things are.
I'm strong, you're weak.
This is reality.
Stop trying to infect me with your Do you ever stop talking?
I don't know which is worse, waking up in a dress not knowin' where I've been, or hearing your self-involved ranting.
- Animal.
- Wrong, Glory.
I'm no animal.
This is humanity you're feeling.
Welcome to the world.
No, no, no.
- Stick around, chica.
- I won't letyou hurt her, Glory.
Shutyour hole, you sanctimonious little meat worm.
I'm going home no matter whatyou do.
- You really think I'll just let that happen?
- Benjamin, what are you doing?
You need her blood?
When I'm through there won't be enough to fill a bottle cap.
- Then you, Hell bitch, have nowhere left - To go.
You can't hurt her and you know it, Ben.
I know it because I feel whatyou're feeling.
Scared.
It's OK.
You don't wanna die.
Who would?
I don't.
You can't, you're immortal.
Nobody has to die here, Ben.
Just let me bleed the girl and go home.
Everything'll work out fine.
Do you believe, with all I know, thatyou can trick me?
Stop and think, baby.
We bleed the kid, return me to my seat of power, - I become a god again - And I disappear.
Unless somebody up there likes you.
Give up the girl, I could like you a lot.
- I won't make a deal with you, Glory.
- When exactly did you get stupid?
I'm offering immortality here.
I believe you.
That's not the problem.
You make me immortal, then what?
I'd have to kill her.
I can't live with that, not even for a day.
Forget about eternity.
Baby, baby Ben.
Why do you worry so much?
When you're immortal, all this crap you've been carryin' around inside, the guilt, the anger, the crazy-makin' pain, it all just melts away like ice cream.
Trust me.
When all this is over I can setyou up real nice.
I'm making it easy.
It's you or the girl.
I can't accept that.
Accept it.
I'm a god, stupid.
I'm sorry.
Don't make this harder than it already is.
I'm sorry, I got no choice.
It's you or me.
No.
Buffy, leave Dawn alone.
What is this?
My gift.
This is what I do.
I'm not talking about this.
I'm talking about this.
Right here, it happened.
I know it's something small, but it's something.
- What?
- Don't go there, Will.
I'm not.
You're the one who keeps dragging me back here.
And you wouldn't be doing that if you weren't trying to show me something.
Do I?
Buffy, come on.
It's your brain.
Just tell me.
What happened here?
This was when I quit, Will.
- You did?
- Just for a second.
I remember.
I was in the magic shop.
I put a book back for Giles.
Nothing special about it.
And then it hit me.
- What hityou?
- I can't beat Glory.
Glory's going to win.
You can't knowthat.
I didn't just know it.
I felt it.
Glory will beat me.
- And in that second of knowing it, Will - I wanted it to happen.
- Why?
- I wanted it over.
This is All of this It's too much for me.
- I just wanted it over.
- If Glory wins, then Dawn dies.
And I would grieve.
People would feel sorry for me.
But it would be over.
And I imagined what a relief it would be.
I killed Dawn.
Is that whatyou think?
My thinking it made it happen.
Some part of me wanted it.
And in the moment Glory took Dawn I know I could have done something better.
But I didn't.
I was off by some fraction of a second.
- And this is why - I killed my sister.
I think Spike was right back at the gas station.
Snap out of it.
- What?
- What?
All this, it has a name.
It's called guilt.
It's a feeling, and it's important.
But it's not more than that, Buffy.
Buffies.
You've carried the weight of the world on your shoulders since high school.
And I know you didn't ask for this, butyou do it every day.
And so you wanted out for one second.
So what?
- I got Dawn killed.
- Hello.
Your sister, not dead yet.
But she will be if you stay locked inside here and never come backto us.
And what if I can't?
Then I guess you're right.
And you did kill your sister.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Where you're needed.
Are you coming?
Buffy?
She's back.
- You're OK?
- Yeah.
I'm OK.
- Hear you found the ritual text.
- Something like that, yes.
- Did you knowthat Ben is Glory?
- So I'm told.
What do we know?
Well, according to these scrolls, it is possible for Glory to be stopped.
I'm afraid it's Buffy, I've read these things very carefully, and there's not much margin for error.
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Might help if you actually said it.
Glory plans to open a dimensional portal by way of a ritual blood-letting.
- Dawn's blood.
- Yes.
Once the blood is shed at a certain time and place, the fabric which separates all realities will be ripped apart.
Dimensions will pour into one another, with no barriers to stop them.
Reality as we know it will be destroyed and - chaos will reign on earth.
- So how do we stop it?
The portal will only close once the blood is stopped.
And the only way for that to happen is Buffy, the only way is to kill Dawn.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": You are the Slayer.
Into each generation a slayer is born.
- Let's start with "Hi, I'm Buffy".
- Xander.
- Cordelia.
- Willow?
- Mr Giles.
- Angel.
Gave me a pretty good run there.
Bet the blood's just pumpin'.
- Bet it's hot.
- Don't hurt me.
Don't hurtyou?
What's going on?
Help me.
Call the police.
- Get outta here, girl.
- Are you guys havin' a fight?
Cos, you know, fighting's not cool.
- Get out of here.
- No, she wants to stay.
I don't mind a little appetiser.
Have you ever heard the expression "Biting off more than you can chew"?
OK.
How about the expression "vampire slayer"?
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- Wow.
Never heard that one.
OK.
How about "Oh, God, my leg"?
Oh, God!
My leg!
See?
Now we're communicating.
Wow.
Been a long while since I met one who didn't know me.
You should get home.
- How'd you do that?
- It's what I do.
Butyou're just a girl.
That's what I keep saying.
- Something goin' on out back?
- Vampire.
- Anything?
- Nothing you want to hear.
- The ritual is - Explain it again.
- There's nothing newto - Go through it again.
The Key was living energy.
It needed to be channelled, poured into a specific place at a specific time.
The energy would flow into that spot, the walls between the dimensions break down.
It stops, the energy's used up, the walls come back up.
Glory uses that time to get back into her own dimension, not caring that all manner of Hell will be unleashed on Earth in the meantime.
But only for a little while, right?
The walls come back, no more Hell?
That's only if the energy is stopped.
And nowthe key is human, is Dawn "The blood flows, the gates will open.
The gates will close when it flows no more".
When Dawn is dead.
I have places to be.
Why blood?
Why Dawn's blood?
I mean, why couldn't it be a lymph ritual?
Cos it's always got to be blood.
- We're not discussing dinner right now.
- Blood is life, lackbrain.
Why do you think we eat it?
It's what keeps you going.
Makes you warm.
Makes you hard.
Makes you other than dead.
Course it's her blood.
Pretty simple math here.
We stop Glory before she can start the ritual.
- We still have a couple of hours.
- If my calculations are right.
But - I don't wanna hear it.
- I understand that.
No, you don't understand.
We are not talking about this.
Yes, we bloody well are!
If Glory begins the ritual, if we can't stop her Come on.
Say it.
We're bloody well talking about this.
Tell me to kill my sister.
She's notyour sister.
No.
She's not.
She's more than that.
She's me.
The monks made her out of me.
I hold her, and I feel closer to her than It's not just the memories they built.
It's physical.
Dawn is a part of me.
The only part that I We'll solve this.
We will.
Don't have another coma, OK?
If the ritual starts, every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death.
Including Dawn.
Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
You'll fail.
You'll die.
We all will.
I'm sorry.
I love you all, but I'm sorry.
OK.
All in favour of stopping Glory before the ritual.
Suggestions?
Ideas?
Time's a-wastin'.
- When you say you love us all - Shut up.
Willow, I betyou've got some dark spell a-brewin'.
Make her a toad?
Little hoppy toad?
We hit her with a hammer?
Hoppy toad.
What about Ben?
He can be killed, right?
I know he's an innocent but not like Dawn innocent.
We could kill a regular guy.
God.
It's doubtful he'll surface again this close to the ritual.
We can expect it's Glory we're dealing with.
We don't have to kill her.
We just have to stop her from doing the ritual.
There's only the one time that she can do it, right?
Yeah.
We get her on the ropes, we keep her occupied till it's too late.
OK.
But I'm still not hearing enough ideas.
- She's a god.
Let's think outside the box.
- You go think outside the bleeding box.
Yes, Anya.
Apart from your uninfectious enthusiasm, have you anything to contribu - The Dagon Sphere.
- Sorry?
When Buffy first met Glory, she found that magical glowy sphere that was meant to repel Glory.
We've got it in the basement.
It might drive her away or hurt her.
And Olaf the troll god's enchanted hammer.
You wanna fight a god, use the weapon of a god.
Nah.
That thing's too heavy to Yeah.
Good.
- I like this.
Thanks.
- Here to help.
Wanna live.
Smart chicks are so hot.
You couldn't have figured that out in tenth grade?
Well, we have some ideas if we could actually get Glory on the run, but But we still have no idea howto find her.
Big day.
It calls me.
I have to be there.
Big day.
They said you have to put this on for the ceremony.
What if I don't?
- Come on.
Just - What if I don't like the colour?
Look, I wish there was another way.
And I wish you'd fall on your head and drown in your own barf, so I guess we're both disappointed.
I think it'll be quick.
Actually, sir, the bleeding is quite a slow process to give the portal time to Thank you for the information.
- I'll do what I can - Change.
- What?
- Change.
Be her.
I don't wanna look atyou.
- Dawn, I don't think you wanna - Be Glory.
Be Glory.
Will you just stop shouting already?
So, what's the hubbub, bub?
What do you got against old Benjy?
He's a monster.
At leastyou're upfront about it.
Don't be so hard on the boy.
He just wants to live.
Most guys'd do the same.
Besides, he's probably the reason your sis and her little cartoon pals are still alive.
That little nagging pinch of humanity that makes me go for the hurt instead of the kill.
Lowering myself to trade blows with the Slayer when I should have just put my fist through her heart.
It's gotta be Ben.
Or maybe you just can't take her.
Funny thing.
You've been here a few hours, and I haven't seen big sis galloping in to save you.
She probably knows what a terrible mistake that'd be.
She's not afraid of you.
No, sweetie, baby.
I'm talking about the ritual.
Cos, you know, I bleed you, the portals open, but once you die they close.
The faster you die, the better for your sorry species.
I'm bettin' Buffy knows that.
Since she's not really your sister, I'm guessin' she isn't gonna show.
And if she does, it might not be to save you.
Buffy.
- Sure you're not gonna tire yourself out?
- I'm sure.
We're still working on ideas.
Time's short, but best leave it to the last moment.
If we go in too early and she takes us out, no chance of getting her to miss her window.
Then we wait.
I imagine you hate me right now.
- I love Dawn.
- I know.
But I've sworn to protect this sorry world.
Sometimes that means saying and doing what other people can't.
What they shouldn't have to.
You try and hurt her, and you know I'll stop you.
I know.
This is how many apocalypses for us now?
Six at least.
Feels like a hundred.
I've always stopped them.
Always won.
Yes.
I sacrificed Angel to save the world.
I loved him so much.
But I knew what was right.
I don't have that any more.
I don't understand.
I don't know howto live in this world if these are the choices.
If everything just gets stripped away, I don't see the point.
I just wish I just wish my mom was here.
The spirit guide told me that death is my gift.
Guess that means a slayer really is just a killer after all.
- I think you're wrong about that.
- It doesn't matter.
If Dawn dies, I'm done with it.
I'm quitting.
Everything is prepared.
OK, campers, it's almost stab time.
You two, get her.
No.
Buffy!
See you in a few.
Any luck?
Have you found the Dagon Sphere?
I'm sure it's here.
Just be a minute.
Yeah, we're on it.
Let's look over here, where we didn't look yet.
- Time is a factor.
- Yes.
Not to worry.
So, are you more relaxed?
No.
No?
I mean, it sounded like you arrived.
No.
Yes.
I had the pleasure moment, and the blissful calm that comes right after it.
But it lasted two seconds and now I'm terrified again.
Well, you don't have to be.
What?
Spike's sex-bot.
Why didn't they just melt it down into scrap?
Maybe Willow wanted it.
I don't think Willowfeels that way about Buffy.
- She's gone through a lot of changes, but - To study it.
Right.
Robotics.
Science.
- Pervert.
- Other pervert.
And don't frighten me like that.
God, who would put something like that there?
Is this supposed to be some sort of sick joke?
I mean, things aren't bad enough?
This is an omen.
No, it's an omen.
It's a higher power, telling me through bunnies that we're all gonna die.
Oh, God.
No, it's not.
It's OK.
No.
You see, usually when there's an apocalypse, I skedaddle.
But now I love you so much I have inappropriately timed sex, try to think of ways to fight a god, and worry terribly that something might happen to you, and also that something'll happen to me.
I have guilt that I'm not more worried about everyone else, but I just don't have enough.
I'm on total overload, and I don't thinkthat I could be more nervous than I am right now.
Care to wager on that?
Anya, you wanna marry me?
- Can I take that as a maybe?
- You're proposing to me.
Yes.
You're proposing to me cos we're gonna die.
And you think it's romantic and sexy, and you know you won't have to go through with it cos the world's gonna end.
- I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
- You can't knowthat.
I believe it.
And I think we're gonna get through this.
I think I'm gonna live a long and silly life, and I'm not interested in doing that withoutyou around.
- OK.
- OK?
Yes.
I mean, yes.
- No.
- No?
After.
Give it to me when the world doesn't end.
- What have you got for me?
- Some ideas.
Well, notions.
Or theories based on wild speculation.
Did I mention I'm not good under pressure?
I need you, Will.
You're my big gun.
I'm your No, I was never a gun.
Someone else should be the gun.
I could be a cudgel.
Or a pointy stick.
You're the strongest person here.
- You knowthat, right?
- No.
Will, you're the only person that's ever hurt Glory.
At all.
You're my best shot at getting her on the ropes, so don't get a jelly belly on me now.
Well, I do sort of have this one idea.
But, last few days, I've mostly been looking into ways to help Tara.
I knowthat shouldn't be my priority Of course it should.
Well, I've been charting their essences.
Mapping out.
I think, if I can get close enough, I may be able to reverse what Glory did, take back what she took from Tara.
It might weaken Glory, or make her less coherent.
Or it might make all our heads explode.
Buffy?
I'll try to work it.
Don't worry, love.
It won't be long.
Bitch.
I'm supposed to work on the factors.
I'm not I'm gonna bring you back.
No, that's good.
That could be pivotal.
- Thank you, guys.
- You're gonna need some - Way ahead of you.
We have time?
- If you hurry.
OK.
I'll grab some weapons too.
- I'm looking for something in a broadsword.
- Don't swing that thing near me.
- I happen to be - A glorified bricklayer?
- I'm also a swell bowler.
- Has his own shoes.
- The gods themselves do tremble.
- Spike, shutyour mouth.
Come with me.
Weapons are by the TV.
I'll grab the stuff upstairs.
Buffy If you wanna just hand them over the threshold Come in, Spike.
Presto.
No barrier.
I won't bother with the small stuff.
Couple of good axes should hold off Glory's mates while you take on the lady herself.
We're not all gonna make it.
You knowthat?
Yeah.
Always knew I'd go down fightin'.
I'm counting on you to protect her.
Till the end of the world.
Even if that happens to be tonight.
I'll be a minute.
I know you'll never love me.
I knowthat I'm a monster.
Butyou treat me like a man.
And that's Getyour stuff.
I'll be here.
She will come to you soon.
We on schedule?
Yes, it's time.
Will?
Tara, baby?
Is there somewhere you should be?
They held me down.
No one's holding you.
It's the big day, right?
Do you wanna go?
You're a killer.
This is all set down.
Stay close but don't crowd her.
We'll follow in a minute.
Everybody knows their jobs.
Remember, the ritual starts - we all die.
And I'll kill anyone who comes near Dawn.
Well, not exactly the St Crispin's Day speech, was it?
- We few.
We happy few.
- We band of buggered.
- Shpedoinkel.
- What is that?
The portal must open up there.
Will, you're up.
Need anything?
Could use a little courage.
The real kind.
But thanks.
You.
What are you doing here?
She's with me.
What the frickin' hell did that bitch do to me?
You look fine.
Truly.
She made a little She made a hole.
- I need a brain to eat.
- Take mine, O Groovetastic One.
I said a brain, you worthless dirt.
Big day.
I got places to be.
Big day.
Need a brain.
Suppose I could always use yours.
OK, then.
Come and get it.
You don't seem very well.
Your little witch bitch gave me kind of a headache there.
But if you thinkthis is gonna last I notice you're talking, whereas in your position, I would attack me.
O, Most Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing One, should we Go guard the girl.
- This is a - Diversionary tactic?
Go guard.
It's strange.
You're not as blurry with speed as usual.
- The witch - It's not her.
Might be this.
I heard it's supposed to repel you.
So my guess is you probably shouldn't touch it, either.
You're gonna wish you Stand fast.
Kill anyone who dares approach.
This will be our day of glory.
- Well punned.
- It just called out to me.
Tara.
Willow?
- Tara?
- Willow - I got so lost.
- I found you.
I will always find you.
You know what?
I'm feeling a little better.
And now I'm a little bored.
I'm sorry.
Cos you're about Wow.
The Slayer's a robot.
Did everybody else know the Slayer was a robot?
Glory?
You're not the brightest god in the heavens.
Buffy!
I'm up here!
Buffy!
No, you don't.
Buffy!
I'm up here!
Buffy!
You lostyour hammer, sweetcheeks.
What are you gonna hit me with now?
Whatever's handy.
And the glorified bricklayer picks up a spare.
- Has anyone noticed we're going backwards?
- It's crossed my mind.
As long as Buffy can keep Glory down long enough, it doesn't matter.
Only a few minutes left to start the ritual.
You.
You can help me.
Untie me.
Please.
Help me, she's coming.
Well, it seems she's running a bit late, is the thing.
And if Her Splendidness can't be here in time to bleed you Hey, kid.
Wanna see a trick?
- How we doing?
- So far it's a tie.
We haven't got up to Dawn, but then neither has anyone else.
Someone's up there.
- OK, we gotta charge or something.
- We tried that.
- Spike, can you hear me?
- Yeah, loud and clear.
- Is there someone up there with Dawn?
- Yeah, can't tell who.
- Are you talking to us?
- Get up there.
Go now.
- Yeah, but - Go.
Well, what do you know?
It's just about that time.
Spike.
Doesn't a fella stay dead when you kill him?
Look who's talking.
Come on, Doc.
Let's you and me have a go.
I do have a prior appointment.
- This won't take long.
- No, I don't imagine it will.
You're just a mortal.
You couldn't understand my pain.
Then I'll just have to settle for causing it.
- You can't kill me.
- No.
But my arm's not even tired yet.
You don't come near the girl, Doc.
I don't smell a soul anywhere on you.
Why do you even care?
I made a promise to a lady.
Then I'll send the lady your regrets.
No.
No.
- Stop it.
- You're a god.
Make it stop.
I'm sorry.
Tell her it's over.
She missed her shot.
She goes.
She ever, ever comes near me and mine again We won't.
I swear.
I guess we're stuck with each other, baby.
Can you move?
Need a minute.
- She could've killed me.
- No, she couldn't.
Never.
And sooner or later Glory will re-emerge, and make Buffy pay for that mercy.
And the world with her.
Buffy even knows that.
And still she couldn't take a human life.
She's a hero, you see.
- She's not like us.
- Us?
Shallow cuts.
Shallow cuts.
Let the blood flowfree.
- Dawn.
- Buffy.
This should be interesting.
- Here.
- Buffy, it hurts.
I got it.
Come here.
You're gonna be OK.
- Go.
- Buffy, it's started.
Xander.
Anya.
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter.
What are you doing?
- I have to jump.
The energy.
- lt'll kill you.
I know.
Buffy, I know about the ritual.
- I have to stop it.
- No.
I have to.
Look at what's happening.
Buffy, you have to let me go.
Blood starts it, and until the blood stops flowing, it'll never stop.
You know you have to let me.
It has to have the blood.
Cos it's always got to be blood.
It's Summers blood.
It's just like mine.
She's me.
The monks made her out of me.
Death is your gift.
- Death - is your gift.
- Buffy, no.
- Dawnie, I have to.
- No.
- Listen to me.
Please, there's not a lot of time, listen.
Dawn, listen to me.
I love you.
I will always love you.
This is the work that I have to do.
Tell Giles Tell Giles lfigured it out.
And I'm OK.
And give my love to my friends.
You have to take care of them now.
You have to take care of each other.
You have to be strong.
Dawn, the hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
Be brave.
Live.
For me.
