{START OF EPISODE 1}
Come on in!
Come on, it's all over!
He won't mess with you!
Are you nuts?
That was a Doberman!
Oh dear, what happened?
Oh, get the first aid kit.
Eddie got into a fight.
We were on the elevator with that Doberman from upstairs.
Eddie took a perfectly innocent sniff, and wham!
Morning, all.
-What's all this?
-Eddie was viciously attacked.
Is that coffee cake I smell?
Well, now that I look at it, it's just a scratch.
But I probably should take him to the vet's anyway.
What are you doing up so early?
Oh, the new station manager's taking over today.
-She wanted to meet with all of us.
-"She"?
-Oh, working for a woman, huh?
-Yes, why?
Well, it's tough on guys, taking orders from a woman.
-We resent it!
-That's absurd.
If I had trouble taking orders from a woman Frederick would never have been conceived!
My brothers couldn't stand taking orders from me.
I was forever telling them "Billy, clean your room".
"Reginald, get your elbow out of the gravy".
"Nigel, take that thing back to the hospital the whole house is full of flies"!
-Morning, Niles.
-Hello, Frasier.
Dad, Daphne.
Uh, I can't stay, I just wanted to ask a favor.
Dad, can I borrow your gun?
-Maris taking singing lessons again?
-No.
Our home security system is down for repairs and with no electric gates I'll just feel safer if I'm packing heat.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.
You don't even know how to pack a lunch.
Dad, please.
Maris is a wreck ever since she found out our entire neighborhood watch is wintering in Palm Beach.
Forget it, you don't know the first thing about guns.
I do so.
I promise I'll open the spinny thing and check for bullets before I shoot anybody.
Actually, Dr. Crane, your father's gun isn't a revolver.
It's a Colt .
45 ACP with a single stack magazine.
When I first came to America, I worked at a convenience store.
Dad, please.
No!
I don't believe in civilians having guns.
This isn't fair!
Maris's mother gave her a gun!
Well, then Maris's mother can clean the mess up after she accidentally blows your brains out.
Dad, now you're talking nonsense.
Maris's mother has never cleaned anything in her life.
This stinks.
This is total BS.
I can't work for a chick.
They're out of control.
They are completely ruled by their hormones.
It'll never work.
All right, all right, listen up everyone.
I've been working the office grapevine.
I've got the scoop on the new boss.
-Is she going to fire me?
-Hey, first things first!
Is she baggable?
Forget it, Bulldog, she'd have you for breakfast.
Right, like I ever stick around that long.
Anyway, the word is that she's like this psycho perfectionist.
Everyone at her last station was scared to death of her.
She's kind of becoming my idol.
Hey, what if she hates sports?
I need this job.
I just promised my mom a new pacemaker.
Wait, think I could get her to believe I said "pasta maker"?
Now, look, there's no reason for us to give in to our insecurities.
We all do good, solid shows.
We hardly even know this woman and already we're painting her as a heartless Medusa!
She said my ratings are down.
She said I'm not "hip".
-Father Mike, are you all right?
-The little thug fired me!
-I'm so sorry.
-Did she say anything else?
She said, "Send in Frasier".
Listen, tell the movers I want the couch directly in front of the bookcase.
Oh, have a seat.
No, not there!
In front of the bookcase!
Look, I got somebody here!
Could we move the furniture later?
Could we do that?
-Dr. Frasier Crane!
Kate Costas.
-Kate, what a pleasure.
Likewise.
I've been listening to the tapes of all your shows.
-I love what you're doing.
-Really?
Well, thank you very much!
I like to think of my show as a haven for the tempest-tossed in the maelstrom of everyday life.
Wow.
You really talk that way.
Anyway, your ratings are very good.
But I still think we can do better.
Any ideas?
How to improve my show?
That is a tall order.
Oh, wait, you know, I was thinking of playing classical music before my intros.
Let's say, perhaps Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra in D Minor.
It's too highbrow.
I mean, I love classical music but to most people it's a big snore.
Oh, incidentally, Bartok's Concerto is in C. -Are you sure?
-Positive.
I put myself through college working at a classical station.
Let's talk about advertising.
You've got a great face.
I want to see it on t-shirts, I want to see it on park benches I even want to see it on Frisbees.
Everybody in Seattle should be tossing it, wearing it, sitting on it!
Wonderful.
You know, I hate to nitpick, but I'm certain that concerto's in D. -I was a music minor at Harvard.
-It's in C. It was commissioned by Serge Kosivinsky in 1943 for the Boston Symphony Orchestra and since then it's been recorded over thirty timesÂeach time, in C. Well maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm right.
Also, I think you should start doing theme shows.
Devote a whole show to people having extramarital affairs or devote a whole show to people with aberrant sexual practices.
-Could you give me a hand with that box over there?
-Of course.
Kate you know, that advertising thing.
It's a very good idea.
But that These theme shows, uh, it's a less good idea.
You might even say a worse idea.
-Why is that?
-Well I am a doctor, and I'd hate to have the serious work I do -be tainted by commercialism.
-But you don't mind the Frisbees.
Well, I don't want to be entirely uncooperative.
It's just that, well, you know, I've been in the radio game for some time now, and I think I've learned enough about broadcasting, as they say, to know what it is that makes my show a good show.
My God, you've won six Golden Mike awards?
Aren't you sweet to notice.
Finally, I would like you to start giving priority to the juicier calls.
-That's called pandering!
-And that is called a Peabody Award!
Well, what exactly do you expect me to do?
Say to a caller "Listen, Bob, I'm sorry you lost your job but unemployment's a snore!
Why don't you go sleep with your best friend's wife and call in on Monday when it'll be Infidelity Day on the Frasier Crane Show"!
I really know what I'm doing here.
The psychiatrists at my last station went national.
Well, you know, I'd rather stay local if going national means sucking at the sump-pump of sensationalism!
Well, I'm the boss, Doc.
So, pucker up!
Listen, lady, I'm not changing my show.
Unless you're willing to explain to the owners why you fired one of your highest-rated hosts well then there's nothing you can do about it, is there?
Well, we're coming up on 3 A.M. Roz, who's our next caller?
Who cares?
I got to disagree with your last two callers.
I'm in the same line of work, and I think that what we do is very important!
People depend on us!
I got to go, Doc, it's time to powder the jelly donuts.
Well, I hate to cut short this enthralling symposium but perhaps we could hear from some non-bakers for a change?
Wrap it up, will you?
We're finally done.
Oh, thank God.
Stay tuned for the news, weather, and sports.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, yadda-yadda-yadda, bye.
-Really stunk up the airwaves with that one, didn't we?
Frasier, I want you to flash forward to tonight.
It's sometime after midnight.
Dennis Abbott and I have just had a glorious meal at Le Ralee.
Dennis has just asked me back to his penthouse apartment to see his priceless collection of silk sheets.
And I lean forward and whisper "I can't.
I have to go to work in an hour".
-What is wrong with this picture?
!
-Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee.
-It's a two-week wait.
-So is Dennis Abbott!
Frasier, we have got to get our old time slot back!
Don't worry, Roz, we will she just moved us to break our spirit.
Well, she can saddle me up and ride me around the coffee room!
I can't do this again!
-Good morning.
-Oh, hello.
Enjoying your new time slot?
As a matter of fact, I found it invigorating!
Didn't you, Roz?
Remember that woman who called in, uh, you know with the delusions of grandeur?
Couldn't understand why nobody liked her.
Well, I hope you explained to her that it's not important that people like her -as long as they respect her.
-Oh yes, respect is important.
-So is self-respect.
-Oh, yes, yes but some people Â and this is so unfortunate can't tell the difference between self-respect and pig-headedness.
Yes, but those people are usually rigid little demagogues who don't know the difference between the kind of respect that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective of what others expect.
Isn't it sad when bad things happen to good sentences?
I think I made myself clear.
Well, I really do have work to do.
I've got to find somebody for your old time slot -now that it's free.
-Good luck!
Nice going, Frasier, now she's never gonna give in.
Steady, Roz.
She may have been able to intimidate people in other stations but here at KACL she'll find that we are not a bunch of spineless twits!
Hey!
Is she gone?
You don't want this bacon, I'm giving it to Eddie.
You know that bacon's not good for him.
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie!
Come here, boy!
-And can't we take that stupid thing off him?
-No!
No!
The vet said if he scratches the scabs, they'll never heal.
And I have noticed that if you sit him next to the telly Channel Five comes in a lot clearer.
Look at him, he's humiliated!
Yeah, well, it doesn't help that that bully upstairs keeps rubbing it in.
You tell him, boy!
Oh, for God's sake, I am trying to get some sleep!
I asked you to keep that dog quiet and instead you outfit him with a megaphone!
In the last thirty-six hours I haven't had so much as a nap and I've got to be back at the station by 2 A.M. Eddie, listen carefully.
By the time this day is up, one of us is going to sleep.
Oh, don't worry, Dr. Crane, I'll take Eddie for a walk.
And as far as your problem at work goes -If you want my opinionÂ -Don't!
I've had my share of women's opinions for the week between the station's new Reichschancellor and Roz's incessant whining!
As far as I'm concerned, your entire sex can put a sock in it!
Boy, you'd never let me get away with a comment like that.
Oh, even the best of us can get a bit cranky when we're overtired.
All Dr. Crane needs right now is a little peace and quiet.
Eddie?
Damn it!
Morning, Daphne.
Where are you off to?
-Oh, I'm taking Eddie for a walk.
-By yourself?
Yes, of course.
Why not?
It's dangerous out there.
You never know when you might need one of these.
A starter's pistol?
Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane.
But thanks for the thought.
How did she know it wasn't a real gun?
It fooled the servants even the ones who spent years fleeing juntas.
You bought a starter's pistol?
Yes, you see, as long as Maris thinks it's real it makes her feel secure, but this way no one can get hurt.
What the hell was that?
!
-Was that a gunshot?
!
-Morning, Frasier.
Just getting up?
"Just getting up"?
!
Are you out of your mind?
!
A gun just went off in here!
Niles bought a starter's pistol.
And there's no need to get snippy.
Accidents happen, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy?
I didn't realize it was too much to ask that there not be gunplay in my living room!
You know, Niles, you shouldn't have any kind of gun, really.
Come to think of it, now that Mr. Sunshine's home during the day maybe I shouldn't either!
Just relax.
It won't be long before my loyal fans protest and the afternoon slot is once again home to the compassionate and lovable Dr. Frasier Crane.
Now get the hell out, both of you!
All right, maybe I can catch up to Daphne in the park.
I'll cover you.
Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
I'll be taking your calls for the next four hours.
Roz, who's on the line?
How should I know?
I just got here.
Line Two, you're on with Dr. Frasier Crane.
-Uh, hey, Dr. Crane.
It's Mark.
-Hello, Mark.
I'm listening.
-OK.
Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, um I've been watching myself on the video camera and the camera-me is doing things I don't approve of.
People think insomnia is a laughing matter, but it's hell.
If I don't get some sleep soon, I'll justÂI'll go crazy!
You've got to help me, Dr. Crane?
Dr. Crane?
Hey, I'm talking here!
What?
!
I'm listening.
So what do you think I should do?
Well, you know, sometimes these things seem clearer in the light of day.
My advice is to sleep on it.
Is that some kind of a joke?
!
-To make fun of the insomniac?
!
-Oh, noÂ Oh, oh, and now for a word from I forget, I think they sell paint.
You hear that whooshing sound?
It's my career going down the toilet.
-Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped a single person tonight.
-Helped?
You'll be lucky if you don't get sued!
You told a longshoreman to come out of the closet and a gay guy to spend more time on the docks!
-Well, you're the one who's supposed to keep track of who's on what line!
OK, let me make it easy for you: Freaks!
Freaks on Line One!
Freaks on Line Two!
Freaks, everywhere!
Roz, Roz, Roz!
We shouldn't get mad at each other.
-Oh God, this is all Kate's fault.
-You're right, you're right.
She's ruining us!
And there's nothing we can do.
Yes, there is!
If we're gonna go down, we're gonna take her down with us!
We've got one hour left.
If she wants raunch, we're gonna give her more raunch than she ever dreamed of!
Are you with me, Roz?
-Just pump up the volume and call me Kitty!
-OK!
We're back, Seattle.
And in accordance with new station policy we are going to be pandering to the lowest human instinct.
In other words who wants to talk about sex?
!
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex!
Yeah!
I want to know who's having sex!
How you're having it!
I want to know if you're having it right now!
Look, Dr. Crane, the lines are hot!
Really hot!
Thank you, Kitty.
-Hello, Caller.
What are you wearing?
-Nothing.
I'm naked Hey, that's a great idea!
Let's all get naked!
Hey, I'm getting naked right now!
While Dr. Crane strips, our new station manager would like to know if you prefer to be the spanker, or the spankee.
Oh, definitely the spanker.
Well then, hop in a cab!
I'm not wearing any pants!
While Roz laces up her leather bustier, this is Dr. Frasier Crane KACL - all talk, all night, all naked!
-Explain.
-As George Bernard Shaw once said "there are two tragedies in life.
One is not getting what we want, and the other is getting it".
You know full well this is not what I wanted!
You did this to vex me.
And you succeeded.
And it was not Shaw, it was Oscar Wilde.
Did you ever open a book at Harvard?
You know, one of these days, you're going to misquote someone and I'm going to land on you like a sumo wrestler!
All I wanted, all I wanted was a lousy little theme show.
Once or twice a week!
Oh, yeah!
"Frasier Crane takes a leering look at infidelity"!
No, not a leering look!
Just a good look.
At the pain of infidelity, at what it does to families at what it does to children, at what it does to the fabric of society and this is just off the top of my head.
But, no!
You are such an arrogant gasbag so used to being cock-of-the-walk around here that you can't stand still for one minute and listen to a perfectly valid suggestion -from somebody else!
-And you are such a smug egomaniac that your entire self-image would shatter like a cheap mirror if you ever had to admit that you had made a mistake!
You are a classic case of neurotic narcissism and a first-class smarty-pants!
-You can go ahead and fire me now.
-Yes, I could do that, yeah.
But I'm not going to.
Did you listen to the whole tape?
Oh, yeah.
But, unlike you, I put what's good for the station above my personal feelings.
Well, that's-that's awfully big of you.
Guess that means I'll be moving back to my old time slot.
Guess again, Captain Midnight!
If I give you back your old time slot without your making a single concession to me that would completely undermine my authority.
Being a crack shrink, surely that's within your grasp.
Grasp this: if I don't get my old time slot, I quit!
Grasp this: you do, and I'll sue you for breach of contract!
OK, then it's a stalemate!
If we don't want to remain entrenched in these positions forever one of us had better think of something!
Yes, one of us better.
-I've got it!
-Damn!
-So, we're together, right?
-Absolutely.
We're not letting her push us around any longer!
Nope.
You do the talking.
I'll stand behind you and burn holes through her with my "You call this a Hollandaise sauce"?
!
glare.
I don't care what you say, I like theme shows!
And I'm going to do them, starting this Friday with "Frasier Crane takes a look at the consequences of infidelity"!
You do, and I'll make you start that show with classical music!
Bartok's Concerto in C, I don't care how much you hate it!
-Damn you!
-It's my way, or no way.
You win.
Bartok it is.
What do you two want?
-Nothing.
-Keep up the good work.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
You try and try, but at some point you finally have to admit as much as you care about each other your relationship isn't working and hasn't been for some time.
But you two wouldn't be sitting here with me if you didn't want to save this relationship.
Isn't that true?
I'm be willing to try.
I can't speak for You don't have to speak for me, Niles.
-I'm perfectly capable of speaking for myself.
-Yes, I know.
Caruso wasn't so in love with the sound of his own voice.
What does that mean?
Well, you tell me, Enrico.
What do you think it means?
I guess I can tell you Gentlemen!
Now, are we agreed that we want to do something to fix this problem?
Why doesn't one of you tell me how this started?
Well, it began with me.
Last week, I was at work doing my radio show.
I was on the air with a troubled young woman.
She had just started telling me about a recurring dream she had since childhood.
Okay, I'm in my bedroom.
I'd just gotten out of the bath tub to get dressed.
When I opened the closet, all my clothes are gone.
Suddenly, I hear the sound of footsteps on the drive outside.
I turn and there is a little girl with her nose pressed up against the window.
-Facinating!
But her breath is clogging up the glass so that I can't make out her face.
Only, I'm sure she's come to tell me something important.
So, a girl on the other side of a glass with an urgent message.
And for some reason you're unwilling or able to receive it.
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, I hate to interrupt but you're all out of time for today.
Oh, dear.
Um, listen, Jill, I'm terribly sorry, but listen I'd like to continue talking to you when we're off the air so please don't hang up.
In the meantime, listeners I've enjoyed our time today.
Tune in again tomorrow when we'll be talking with Blah, blah, Frasier Crane Show, happy health, goodbye!
-Yo, Jill.
You a football fan?
-Not really.
-Beat it!
All right, let's talk women scum!
I hate this job.
Not only do I have to put up with that annoying little sweat-sock but when a caller comes in who has a truly fascinating problem I'm barely even able to scratch the surface.
It makes me want to run screaming back to private practice!
I can imagine how frustrated you must be.
This show's gotta be constraining for a man of your staggering intellect.
Hold it, stop, wait a minute!
You expect us to believe that Roz actually used a phrase like "staggering intellect"?
It was something like that.
So, she might have said your "boundless brilliance" or, say, "the Olympian reaches of your wisdom".
-Oh, Niles, do shut up.
-Oh, you shut up!
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
It is not important exactly what was said.
What is important is that he assumes it revolves around him when the truth is it started several days before that, with me.
I'd been having some trouble with the psychiatrist in the office next door.
His unconventional therapy had started to intrude upon my sessions.
Mrs. Kelly, the key here is that you trust me.
So long as you're in this office you have no reason to feel anything but safe.
You must think of this as your refuge, your sanctuary.
I'm not saying that being a sole survivor of a plane crash wasn't a traumatizing experience for you.
But, I can get you to a point where the memories no longer haunt you.
His primal scream madness was ruining my practice.
I had to do something.
The opportunity presented itself that Friday.
I'd come to Frasier's for dinner.
I remember Daphne my father's health care worker, was telling the most delightful story Oh, I know what you're going though, dealing with a noisy neighbour.
Have I ever mentioned that couple that lived next door to me in London?
A married couple, who made the most un-Godly racket - in bed!
The walls must have been like tissue paper because I'd hear the whole performance every night.
Finally, I decided the only to get them to stop was to let them hear what I'd been hearing.
So, one night, I moved near the wall and I started Problem solved.
I'm sorry, Daphne, I drifted.
Would you mind telling that story again?
Hold it, stop!
Niles, you know full well that Daphne merely told us that story, she did not act it out.
-Didn't she?
-No!
Just tell the story!
-Fine.
It was a few hours later.
We were having espresso and, perhaps to counter-act the stimulative effect Frasier was telling us about his day.
You know, I can't stop thinking about my last caller today.
Fascinating young woman who had a recurring dream.
You know who's a hell of a dreamer?
Eddie.
One night I'd wake up, he's lying on my forehead dead asleep, with a big clump of my hair in his mouth, growlin'!
Bet you'd love to analyze that little brain of his.
Yes, that would be the jewel in the crown of my career!
Still, thinking about this woman has started me longing for private practice.
I guess I just miss the chance to dig deep with my patients.
-Have you considered seeing patients on the side?
-Oh yes, of course.
I've got a list of people who've expressed interest.
Frasier, I have a proposition.
I mentioned that doctor in the office next door?
Well, his lease is up.
If you were interested in his office, as his landlord I could tell him and his screaming meamies to hit the road!
You and I Working side by side?
I don't mind telling you the prospect sounds quite exciting!
-We could consult on each other's patients.
-We could give seminars together.
-Even therapy groups!
-Oh, my God!
"Crane & Crane", I can see our logo already; a giant Crane hovering over a human head!
Dad, why are you laughing?
Why is Dad laughing?
You two, you'll never learn.
-Oh, oh, you think this is a bad idea?
-The restaurant you bought together that was a bad idea!
The book you tried to write together, that was a bad idea!
But this No, that restaurant was still the stupidest one.
-Two little mis-adventures and you doom us to failure.
-Oh, baloney.
You've been like this since you were kids.
You two can't work together.
Maybe Dad's right.
We're not ready for this.
-It could lead to conflict and tension.
-Hold it!
-Niles, tell the truth!
-Oh, all right.
Stop raining on our parade, Dad!
To "Crane & Crane"!
Well, our first day together began innocently enough -Good morning, Dr. Crane.
-And to you, Dr. Crane Oh, Niles, why should we be so formal, there's nobody around.
-It's a hi-five, Niles!
-Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
-Coffee?
-Oh, yes, please.
Oh, Niles, I can't tell you how much I've missed that.
The smell of the office place.
Freshly oiled leather couches, the pungent coffee the aroma of an exotic luncheon special wafting up from the cafeteria below.
Actually, that's the lab next door.
They lost power last night some of their tissue samples turned.
By the way, I've put together some recent articles you may want to peruse just to get up to speed.
-Up to speed?
-Well it has been a while since you've practised and we could all use a little brushing up.
Well, that's very considerate of you.
-Just put my homework assignment in my box there.
-As you wish.
All right, where shall we put this then?
-Well, the only place it should go, actually is right here by the couch, I think.
No, no, Daphne, here on the desk will pick up the earth tones in the carpet.
No, there's this desk space here by the coffee station.
Oh, underneath the heating vent?
!
Why not just give it a blindfold and a cigarette!
-It's your office, put it where you like.
-No, no, it is your plant.
And it's my bleedin' back, so I'm putting it right here!
Honestly, I don't know how you put up with him.
-Liar!
Liar!
Daphne never said that!
-Well, she said it with body language.
I happen to be fluent in that language and she said nothing of the kind!
Will someone tell me what's so important about this plant?
You'll know soon enough.
I'm telling the rest of the story.
I'm putting it right here!
You know the best thing about getting old?
Your hair may turn grey your joints may stiffen, you may even have to walk with a cane.
But people still ask you to help them move!
Forgive me for overburdening you, Dad.
Could you just put those in my office, please?
Oh, look at your two names together on the door.
Er, Dr. Crane, is your brother's name smaller than yours?
Yes, that was the only way it would fit.
I assumed you wouldn't mind - after all, we're concerned here with healing people, aren't we?
Of course, Niles.
If I were interested in self-promotion I guess I'd be content with my radio show heard every day by over half a million listeners the Pacific Northwest and parts of Canada!
-What are you doing?
-I'm moving the Chepalire.
I like it where it was.
Yes, but it didn't like it there.
It wants light.
You two tend to your plant, I'll go fetch the file cabinet!
I have had this plant for two years and it has never been in direct sunlight.
Well, obviously, look at it, the leaves are puckering!
They are not, they've wilted a little from the ride over in the trunk of the car.
Oh, nonsense Mafia snitches emerge from car trunks looking more robust!
-This plant is going right over -And so it begins!
Of course, the incident with the plant was only the beginning.
That was followed by a run-in at the receptionist's desk a row at the coffee machine, and a contretemps when Frasier lost the men room's key.
-That was an accident.
-Yes, it very nearly was.
I am so tired of your exaggeration.
You always make things fifteen thousand times worse than they are!
I'm going to tell the story from now on!
The point is, our nerves were, well, pretty much shot by the time we conducted our first therapy group together First off, I have a colleague to introduce.
He is not only an esteemed psychiatrist he happens to be my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane.
Afternoon.
-Wow, you're Dr. Crane from the radio.
-Guilty as charged.
Yes, but we all have to remind Dr. Crane that this is real psychiatry now, not the radio.
No hanging up on the hard ones here!
But rest assured I am trained to deal with a full range of issues.
Everything from envy to jealousy.
But I'll just be observing today.
I don't know you well enough to render any opinions yet, so just -pretend I'm not here.
-And good luck with that.
Mrs. Kalish, perhaps you could bring us up to date on how you're dealing with your divorce.
-This is week two, isn't it?
-Yes.
-Well, I actually had my first date last night.
-That's wonderful.
-Did you say something?
-I don't think so.
It sounded like "Hmmm" like you disapproved.
Well, since you've asked.
I think in divorce we have painful feelings which are never the less healthy feelings.
We start to date too quickly and we want to be sure that that's not panacea for the pain.
Ooh, yes, you'll all find my brother's quite adept with those peppy little bromides; "panacea for the pain"!
You can almost hear the phrase: We'll be right back after these words from "Pringles"!
You don't want to wait too long before you date though, either.
I waited five years.
But then I was so desperate I stayed with the first woman who came along.
She ended up being the same controlling ice princess as my first wife.
-Well, Mr. Carr -Wait, Dr. Crane.
It sounded like your brother said something again.
Well, since you've asked.
It occurred to me that by waiting for five years and becoming, as you said, desperate that perhaps you were really giving yourself license to pursue the woman who reminded you of your first wife.
You had to repeat the pattern.
So, you're saying that it wasn't an accident?
-We have an expression in psychiatry: "there are no accidents".
Now let's check in with news and traffic.
Dr. Crane, are you denying that most accidents happen for a reason?
No, Dr. Crane, I believe they do.
I'm reminded of a recent "accident" involving a four-inch wooden block attached to a men's room key which walked off in somebody's pocket!
Clearly an act of hostility, wouldn't you say?
!
Certainly a well-deserved one considering what an insufferable prig someone has been today!
You dare call me a prig after I rescued you from that sideshow you call a radio program?
-One more crack about my show and I'll put that little wooden block in a place you'll always be able to find it!
Group, take five minutes of quiet introspection!
Frasier, I have made a fist and I'm thinking of using it.
Niles, you are not scaring me The thumb goes on the outside, Niles!
On the outside!
-How dare you try to steal my group!
-I don't need your group!
-I've got a group of my own, half a million strong!
-Oh yes, your legions!
Why don't you rent a farm pass out the body paint and call it "Frasier-stock"!
You know, I'm just a little tired of your condescending attitude.
You have not missed one single opportunity to run down my show or grab a book off the shelf to help me "get up to speed"!
My God, you're such a brilliant healer you've even taken over the care of my Schefflera!
-Well, you were starving it of sunlight!
-All right, fine.
Let's just give this little dear all the sunlight it needs!
Are you insane?
!
If I were, "Doctor," you'd never know it!
Is that my group?
Group, group, come back, group!
I'm very proud of this show of independence!
-I hope you're happy!
-If I were, "Doctor," you'd never know it!
Stop saying that!
-Dr. Crane!
-Hello, Dr. Schachter.
-What's going on?
I'm having a discussion with my brother.
I could hear your discussion across the hall in my office.
Well, you see, he waltzed in here like the belle of the ball and yet Now, look, you two are obviously in some distress.
As you know, I am a specialist in couples therapy.
Now I've never treated brothers before, but still if you step into my office, I'm sure I can help you.
Hold it!
Hold it!
I never said, "I'm sure I can help you".
I said, "I may be able to help you".
-See how he twists your words?
-Right here, buddy boy.
Enough!
You are doctors!
I've never seen anything like this in my life.
You think he's trying to steal your patients and you think he's trying to undermine you as a psychiatrist.
But you must know what is at the root of this problem.
He is!
No.
You have a fundamental lack of trust.
Now it may be so deeply rooted by now that it's impossible to change but there are certain exercises that we try provided that you two are willing.
Let's start with the most basic trust exercise there is.
Now, why don't you simply stand on this foot stool and fall backwards into your brother's waiting arms thus demonstrating that we can trust each other.
-Dr. Crane, why don't you go first?
-Well, all right.
-Just get up there, and let yourself go.
-All right.
Is he standing directly behind me?
Yes, now trust your brother.
I'd feel better if he were wearing rubber soles.
Oh, for God's sake, Niles, just get down, I'll go first.
All right?
-Is he in position?
-Yes!
Trust him!
You should know he catches like a girl!
I don't believe this.
Get down, will you?
This couldn't be easier!
I get up here I count to three, and you catch me.
One, two, three.
-Why didn't you catch him?
!
-Well, you were closer!
-It was your turn!
-"It was my turn"!
That is it!
That is it!
In thirty years as a couples therapist I've never said what I'm about to say: Give up!
It's hopeless!
You are pathologically mistrustful of each another!
Competitive to the point of madness!
So, trust me, just meet each other at weddings and funerals, and the rest of the time stay the hell away from each other!
Now, I am going to limp to the nearest pub and drink until the rest of me is as numb as my ass!
That's quite a diagnosis.
Yes.
But there is no denying it.
We are -vindictive and competitive -Petty, mistrustful As so often in these cases it took someone outside our situation to point it out to us.
Well, Dad always said it, but he has no credentials.
Well, there's no arguing with Dr. Schachter's credentials.
My God, the man is an expert in his field.
He graduated from the University of Grenada!
Well, surely that was just his undergraduate schooling.
Oh yes, of course, his graduate work was done in Aruba!
An all-Caribbean schooling well, tally me banana!
I knew he was a fraud the minute he opened his mouth.
Oh, I'll have him out of his lease at the end of the week.
Niles, we still have time to catch a late lunch!
Oh, oh, oh, "Peris" is just around the corner.
-Away we go.
Oh, "Chez Shea" is just as close.
Yes but the food at "Peris" is much better.
Oh, Niles.
Have you lost your mind?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Well, we have time for one more caller.
Roz?
We have Ed on line three.
Hello, Ed, I'm listening.
Ed?
Ed?
Well, we seem to have lost Ed.
Let's take another caller.
On line four we have Roz?
Roz?
We have Eye Lean.
Oh, Eileen.
-Hello Eileen, I'm listening.
-Dr. Crane I've been very happily married for twenty years and I wouldn't dream of cheating but lately when we're making love I find myself fantasizing about -people other than my husband.
-Well, that's perfectly normal.
It's quite normal to spice up one's love life by imagining a tryst with -a sports figure or a movie star or -Or a radio psychiatrist?
-Excuse me?
-It's your voice, Dr. Crane.
You must have the most sensuous voice on earth.
Oh, I don't know, Eileen.
I've never seen your picture.
Would you mind describing yourself?
Oh, well I don't really think that's appropriate -I'll do it.
-Roz, I don't think He's about six-one, with a granite jaw and the broad shoulders of a marine.
He's been wearing his hair short lately but that only accentuates his cobalt blue eyes his chiseled cheekbones and his full, provocative lips.
Wow!
Thanks Roz.
And thank you, Dr. Crane.
I'll be thinking of you tonight.
With any luck, twice!
Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane feeling a little red in his chiseled cheeks.
Till tomorrow then, this is KACL 780 AM.
Roz, that was quite a flattering description.
You know, just out of curiosity Were you just helping that lady with her fantasy or do you really see me that way?
You really don't know, do you?
Frasier, I am so attracted to you, I always have been.
Your looks, your voice You don't know how many times I've wanted to strip naked and hurl myself at that glass partition like a bug on a windshield.
-Are you through?
-Well, ask a stupid question!
All right Roz, I will see you tomorrow.
Hey, aren't you going to the staff meeting?
No, no, no, just tell them that my aunt died.
I'm off to her lawyerÂs now, she put me in charge of her memorial.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.
She was a dreadful old harpy.
Life around her was miserable.
That should look nice on her headstone.
Well, I don't mean any disrespect but the entire time I knew her she never said anything to me that wasn't scornful, derisive or contemptuous.
So how come she made you in charge of her memorial?
I was her favourite!
-Evening all.
-Hello.
Dad, I thought we had an agreement.
Eddie doesn't roll around on the sofa and I don't throw him in front of a bus!
-Hello, Daphne.
-Oh, hello Dr. Crane.
-Will you be joining us for dinner?
-If it's not too much trouble.
It's Maris's night to host her book club and they are more comfortable not having a man there.
Yes, apparently Niles makes the ladies self-conscious.
Well, I sat in on the last discussion and Mrs. Esterbrook-Kindred developed a facial tic every time she had to say the word "Balzac".
So how did it go with Aunt Louise's lawyer?
Did you get the old bat's affairs straightened out?
Ask her yourself.
Apparently, it was Aunt Louise's wish that Niles dispose of her ashes.
Now the pressure's on me to find the perfect place for her to rest for eternity.
I haven't the faintest idea what to do with her.
Why don't you just flush her down the toilet?
-Mr. Crane, you can't do that!
-Why not?
She loved the water.
Oh, oh, that's it: the beach.
Oh, no, no, she hated seagulls.
And vice-versa.
Oh, oh, oh no!
It doesn't matter where I pick you know it's not going to be good enough.
Whatever I did she always found fault.
Remember when I used to mow her lawn?
Yes, what about the Christmas tree I bought her?
The ashtray I made at camp?
"Is that the best you can do?
It wobbles"!
I wish I had that ashtray now!
-So when's the memorial service?
-It's two weeks after tomorrow.
Lucky lucky me, her last request was that I deliver the eulogy.
Oh come on now, you can handle it.
You just stand up there and say a few nice things.
There aren't any!
Then just make them up.
Everyone lies a little in eulogies.
No Daphne, I refuse to invent virtues the woman didn't have.
I'll just have to find something good I can honestly say about her.
Good luck!
She was nothing but a crabby, tight-fisted old pain.
All she ever did was sit around that house day after day watching TV.
She kept that same old cruddy furniture all her life.
What?
Oh, remember how she always used to complain about the winters?
Oh yeah.
Every year she was going to take a trip to the South Pacific.
It was her big dream.
But would she spend the money?
Nooooo.
She just sat around whining all the time about how she'd like to be in a warmer climate.
My guess is she finally made it.
I think it would be terribly bad to go through life having a secret dream and never fulfilling it.
You'd never do anything silly like that, would you Mr. Crane?
-What're you talking about?
-Oh, I don't know.
Perhaps a little something involving a certain shoebox you keep hidden.
-Shoebox?
-Forget it, it's not important.
Oh fine, if you don't want to talk about it, don't talk about it.
It's only something you've given over thirty years of your life to.
Hey, I didn't tell you that so you can go around blabbing it to everyone.
-Tell us, dad, what's in the shoe box?
-Nothing, all right?
All right, all right.
It's just some songs I wrote -for Frank Sinatra.
-And he keeps them in his shoebox.
I think your work here is done.
Dad?
Your mother and I used to listen to Sinatra all the time.
I know most of his songs by heart.
I guess I got it into my head one day that I'd try to write a song myself.
I'd be at the station house or on a stakeout I'd get an idea and pretty soon I had a shoebox full.
I used to imagine your mother and I seeing Frank in the stands in Vegas and he'd open the show with one of my songs.
Oh gee, dad, why did you never tell us about this?
-Because it is stupid.
They were no good -Oh And don't bother to ask, I'm not letting you see 'em.
Here they are.
Just like I told you, in his shoebox.
-They're quite good if you ask me.
-"You are the song my soul would sing".
-Very poetic.
-"You make my heart go ring-a ding-ding".
That was during Frank's ring-a-ding period.
Lord, this shoebox is full of them.
-"I didn't mean to hurt her, she made me lose my mind".
-Hey, lemme see that!
No, that's just some confession I took from a guy.
The lyrics are on the back.
Anyway, I never finished them.
They were never any good.
Well, except this.
I gotta admit this has got "Frank Sinatra" written all over it.
"She's such a groovy lady".
It's still got that nice contemporary sound.
So, why don't you send it to old Blue Eyes?
No, they're just words scribbled on a piece of paper.
The tune's in my head, I don't know how to write it down.
Well, Niles and I do.
You've got the tune in your head.
Why don't you let us write it down for you?
We can finish this dream tonight.
-It's just a dumb idea.
-Oh come on dad, really.
Oh, you're wasting your breath trying to convince him to do something.
-Dad, come on.
-Come on now.
Drop it.
Yeah, you're probably right.
You just sit there night after night watching TV until the time finally comes when we collect your ashes and scatter them over that chair where they'll probably go unnoticed.
-All right, okay.
-You mean it?
-OK, Niles.
-I get the piano.
Okay, so boys the way I'm hearing the intro, it goes something like this Of course, it is your piano.
No, no, it goes: -So it's like -No, no, come on, this is the big finish.
Dad, dad, in Niles's defense, after four hours your sound a lot like your -Right, Niles, let's just try it again.
-All right.
Like this.
Yeah!
That's it.
-Yeah.
Let's hear the chorus one last time.
-OK!
Niles.
Dad, I don't mean to criticise.
You know that "heidi-hiedi"?
It sounds like Cab Calloway sung backwards.
-You got any better suggestions?
-Er, yes, yes: No, no: "She makes the bravest cat go 'fraidy"!
I've got it: "She could have slept with Warren Beatty"!
-Very nice Daphne, no.
-Well, I'm sticking with my one, keep singing.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to quibble but it seems like her heart is always going heidi-hiedi ringy-dingy, or scooby dooby.
-Look, I don't need another critic.
-Fine, perhaps a cardiologist?
In all due respect I think I'm a little more tuned in to what Frank likes and this is pretty close to perfect the way it is.
-Well?
How about that!
Thirty years and I've finally finished it.
Congratulations, dad.
Thanks guys.
Yeah, first thing tomorrow, I'm mailing it to Frank's people.
A little help from Lady Luck maybe they'll kick it upstairs to the chairman himself.
Oh Jeez!
The service is in an hour.
Aren't you finished with that eulogy yet?
I can't even come up with a first line.
I got this old photo album, probably one of her pictures might inspire me.
How about this: "We all loved Aunt Louise, even if the camera didn't"!
Dr. Crane, you've been agonising over this for two weeks.
Perhaps it's time to start bending the truth a little.
No, I refuse to lie.
I find it hard to believe there isn't one nice story you can tell about her.
Maybe a cute little saying she used?
I'm not sure that, "Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about" would qualify.
-Where are you off to?
-Just going to go check the mail.
I wish they'd just give him an answer about that song.
He must have made a hundred trips to the mailbox during the past two weeks.
Oh, bless you, Daphne.
Are you sure you're up to coming to the memorial?
Oh, it's just a little cold.
Besides, in my family, when there was a funeral everybody went.
I remember when Grammy Moon passed on.
My brothers had been off on a three-day bender.
They couldn't even stand on their own - pissed as newts!
But they crawled to that chapel on their hands and knees.
Very commendable.
Yeah, well, they had an obligation.
They were the pallbearers.
Hello, Daphne.
-Hello.
Oh dear Lord, Niles, don't tell me you haven't disposed of those ashes yet.
Frasier, I have taken them to a dozen locations.
Fossy glade, a babbling brook, a moonlit pond.
None of them felt right, what am I going to do?
Well, winter's coming.
The sidewalks are always slippery.
I'm having the same problem with the eulogy!
Oh, remember when this photo was taken?
the day Aunt Lousie took me to Wilson's Meadow to fly a kite?
It cost her 35 cents and when it got stuck in a tree she made me climb up after it.
I fell out, broke my collarbone in two places.
I think that's the only time I saw her laugh.
Frasier!
I think she might be happy there!
Niles, I think you might be right.
And even if she's not, let's still do it.
-Any news about your song?
-Nah.
Listen, we better get started.
All right.
Perhaps I'll have some inspiration on the way over in the car.
And Wilson's Meadow is on the way.
We can stop and scatter the ashes.
Well, this sounds like a family affair.
-Maybe I'll take my car and meet you there.
-All right, let's go.
Wilson's Meadow is the perfect place.
Aunt Louise, you've tormented me for two weeks and finally I've shown you I can do something right.
Oh, shut up!
Here, here, yes, yes.
Perfect.
There's something rattling in here.
Like some great grisly morata.
What am I going to say at this memorial?
-Don't ask me.
-You write lyrics, don't ya?
-Right!
Tell that to Sinatra!
Oh, dad, it's a good song.
I even caught myself singing it in the shower this morning.
Just because you haven't heard anything yet doesn't mean -you have heard something?
-Yeah.
-This morning they rejected it.
-Oh, I'm sorry, dad.
Oh, it's okay.
Sinatra must get thousands of songs sent to him.
What did I expect?
-Well, you know, at least you gave it your best shot.
-Yeah, I guess.
I mean, sure it would have been nice to hear it sung but hey, I finished it, finally!
Yeah, I walked down that highway and climbed that mountain, and reached for the stars.
Oh sure, now I get hot!
-I can't open the damn urn!
-Oh, you are so helpless!
-For Pete's sake, give it to me, give it to me.
-I made it loose.
It looks like Louise's whole rest home showed up.
It must be "Liver & Onions Day" in the cafeteria.
Apparently when they heard it was Frasier Crane from the radio speaking, the whole rest home turned out.
-Can't wait to hear what he has to say.
-Neither can he.
He's huddled in the rectory still working on his first sentence.
How did the scattering go?
Were there any problems?
No, nothing important.
Dear friends, thank you all for coming today.
I know how very deeply your friendship was treasured by Louise.
We are privileged to have with us her favourite nephew one of Seattle's most eloquent speakers, Dr. Frasier Crane.
Dr. Crane has spent the last fortnight reflecting on what Louise meant to him.
Dr. Crane?
Well, well, well.
What can I say about Aunt Louise?
What can I say?
Louise touched us all.
In fact she touches us still.
Aunt Louise loved to teach us all lessons.
You know, it's hard to picture her without hearing her saying, "I'm going to teach you a lesson".
What particularly comes to mind by the very way she lived her own life she taught us how important it is to pursue our dreams.
Whether we succeed or fail what really matters is that we tried.
And now as we say goodbye to Louise a phrase comes to mind.
It was coined by my very own father "She's Such A Groovy Lady".
I said, "She's Such A Groovy Lady".
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
-Hello, Niles.
-Frasier, quick give me your museum membership card.
-What for?
-I just heard tickets go on sale today for the exhibit of fourteenth century Japanese netsuki figurines.
Oh, then the rumours were true?
Hurry, hurry, I want to get there -before the line forms.
-Five seconds.
Oh, just give me a minute, Niles.
Just sit tight, huh?
And we're back.
Before we take our last call I'd like to remind you that Mercy Hospital will be conducting free blood pressure testing this Saturday on Whidbey Island.
Hypertension leads to strokes, heart disease and other maladies.
So we should all be on the lookout for symptoms like shortness of breath quickening of pulse, irritability- Oh, will you just shove the damn thing into your mouth!
So let's all join together to help defeat this silent killer.
Roz, who is on the line?
On line four we have Mac, who's recently moved here from Australia and he's having a problem with a co-worker.
Hello, Mac, welcome to Seattle, I'm listening.
Well, mate, it like your Shelia said.
I'm working with a real yob-out.
He goes on and on about things nobody gives a billabong about just to show off how smart he is.
Well, you have my sympathy.
There's nothing more irritating than pointless and pretentious erudition.
My advice to you is to simply avoid him, is that possible?
Not really, you bloody wallaby!
You're on right before me!
Stay tuned for the Bulldog.
Well, that's one on me, or rather one on me and my call screener, Roz whose ancestors were once heard remarking "Oh, what a nice wooden horse, of course I'll sign for it".
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health.
Gotcha!
How many times have I asked you to desist with your adolescent antics?
-I've got a sense of humour!
-I mean it, I'll go over your head!
Stop it, you're scaring me!
Listen, you sleazy little lyme tick you do that one more time and I'll cut you off.
-And I don't mean mid-sentence!
-Stop it, you're scaring me!
Do you believe these hijinks I have to put up with?
No.
Who would have thought it with a station whose current motto is, "Yakkety-Yak, We Talk Back"?
Oh, run along.
-Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.
-Miss Costas I'd like you to meet my brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
-How do you do?
-EnchantÃ©.
I'd love to stay and chat but I'm off to get tickets -for Frasier and me at the Japanese netsuki exhibit.
-You'll love it.
I saw it in Kyoto.
It's just such a shame they're not letting the really rare pieces out of the country.
As my Japanese gardener says, Maimoshi chikosho.
Watch your mouth!
Oh, you speak Japanese?
Oh, I'll just retreat so that I can be one with my humiliation.
Oh Kate, can I have a word with you?
-I'm in kind of a hurry.
-Yes, well, it'll just take a moment.
I seriously doubt that, but go ahead.
Yes, I've tried dealing with this problem on my own but Bulldog insists on interrupting my show -with his foolish pranks.
-I heard.
Yes, well I did not spend eight gruelling years at Harvard to be mocked by that -juvenile jackass!
-Shameless!
-Oh, he's beyond shameless!
I'm talking about the way you manage to get Harvard into every conversation.
Well, I'm sure you'll mention your alma mater too some day when it's accredited!
Gee, you sure know how to ask for help!
-No, I'm sorry.
-All right, all right.
-I know, I'll take care of it.
-Just make sure he understands that You went to Harvard, I know, I know.
Hey, the key to this game is the husky secondary.
Jack, how can I put this to you delicately?
You're a moron!
Shut up!
You know squat!
You know less than squat!
You and squat could go to the movies and squat could wear an "I'm With Stupid" T-Shirt!
You're awesome, Bulldog.
Way to nail a blow on Dr. Crane!
-You are the greatest!
-Yeah, whatever, shut up.
Now, look, all you guys sending in any postcards to win tickets to the SeaHawks game.
Do I need another picture of the Space Needle?
Chicks in thongs!
Enough said?
We'll be back right after this.
Hey, what I just said, I'm sorry.
I meant to say women in thongs.
-Stop busting Frasier's chops, enough said?
-Well I could, but see all these lines lit up?
They're all waiting to tell me how funny it was.
Are all these callers waiting to tell Bulldog how much they liked the joke he played on Frasier?
All except the guy on nine, he thinks Bulldog sucks.
-Because of what he did to Frasier?
-No, just in general.
-So, what do you want me to do?
-If you think I'm going to allow you to publicly mock one of our most respected hosts on air just for the sake of higher ratings you and I are going to get along just fine!
Come on, Eddie, you love patÃ©.
And this is the good stuff.
-Uh-oh.
-Two syllables every homeowner loves to hear upon entering the door.
Would that have anything to do with the fact that you're feeding my imported foie gras to a dog?
Well, I'm sorry, but it calms him during the thunder.
Oh, well, heaven forbid that Eddie should ever work a nerve!
When Niles gets here we'll have sherry and snausages!
That reminds me, Dr. Crane will be a bit late.
Your father asked him to stop at the vet and pick up some pills for Eddie.
I'm the one who's had a hard day.
How come no one ever brings me tranquilizers?
I've often wondered that myself.
-Hello?
-Hello, this is Dr. Julius Irving.
I'm calling for Dr. Niles Crane his receptionist said he might be there.
I'm sorry, I am expecting him if you'd like to leave a message.
No, no, nothing important.
Some of the boys here at the club have a little bet going about "The Mikado".
Well, perhaps I can help.
I'm Niles's brother Dr. Frasier Crane, and as luck would have it I was in an all-male version of "The Mikado" at Oxford.
People still ask to see my Yum-Yum.
I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to "Three Little Maids"?
Well, let me see.
Well, of course my falsetto isn't what it used to be but, um Dad, would you please be quiet?
-I'm trying to settle a bet here.
-You sure are!
Some caller bet Bulldog he couldn't make you sing over the air.
Sayonara, Doc!
Well, Dad, I'm glad to see that you're amused having your own son humiliated publicly.
Oh, come on, it's funny.
He makes everybody look stupid the guys in the newsroom, Chopper Dave That is not exactly a miracle transformation when it comes to Chopper Dave.
A man whose life work consists of looking down at the freeway and saying, "Crowded"; "Not Crowded".
-Where are you going?
-To the station!
Oh, come on, Frasier, don't take it all so seriously.
You know, we played jokes like this all the time when I was on the force.
The day they replaced my bulletproof vest with a big lacy bra I knew I was one of the guys.
Thank you, Dad.
That also clears up a question that's troubled me for years concerning the night you were shot!
The "Salmon" that's what you want to name our expansion hockey team, "The Seattle Salmon"?
!
Why don't you take your two IQ points, rub them together see if you can't start a fire, beat it!
-Hey, you're in the doghouse!
-Hey, am I on?
Yes, take as long as you want!
Hey, Bulldog, you're the man.
How about we name them "The Bulldogs"?
Hey, you want to suck up?
Send money!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I got another one.
-What about "The Lizards"?
-I hate lizards, they're disgusting.
They make my skin crawl.
You're an idiot -and you don't deserve to live!
-You're the best, Bulldog!
Shut up!
Back in thirty!
-I warned you.
-Hey, hey, clear your jets.
Kate told me to keep busting ya'.
Said it's good for ratings.
You got a beef, take it up with her!
-I don't believe you.
-Pete, what did Kate say?
-She said you're a pig.
-No, before that!
She said keep raggin' on the doc'!
-I want to talk to Kate now!
-She's not in.
-Oh, very clever.
"She's not in".
Like that'll make me go away!
She's not in!
I need a copy of our contract with Nanette Stewart.
What's Yum-Yum doing here?
It's all right, I can guess.
You promised you'd put an end to Bulldog's shenanigans and instead you encouraged him.
You're cancelling "Pet Chat With Nanette"?
!
She's been on for six years.
Yeah, but she's been floating at the top of the bowl for the last two.
When I went in to talk to Bulldog the phones were lit up like Times Square.
His fans love it when he zaps you.
-So, you would have me ridiculed for the sake of those hyenas!
-No.
I would have you fight back.
He makes pot shots at you, you come back at him in your droll, Ivy League, "look at me I've got a thesaurus" kind of way!
-It'll be funny!
-Funny?
!
Funny!
?
I refuse to engage in a battle of wits with a man who's favourite t-shirt reads "Seattle Hooter Inspector"!
-Afraid of the competition?
-I am a doctor, I went to medical school!
I will not embarrass myself by engaging in a grab for ratings.
You just announced to a half a million listeners that you are "filled to the brim with girlish glee".
I think the H.M.S Pinafore of embarrassment has sailed!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to fire someone.
Oh, God, she brought Spanky!
Kate, this is not over!
Do you know what your problem is?
You have no sense of humour.
-I am sick and tired of people telling me that!
-Well, then, lighten up.
I asked the Raiders' defensive line to describe their tackling skills and here's what they said.
Good evening, Daphne.
-Evening, Dr. Crane.
-Did you bring Eddie's pills?
-Yes.
And the vet gave very specific instructions.
"Take one tablet per hour or as needed until trembling subsides".
I'm sorry, these are for Maris.
Those are for Eddie, here you go.
I'll just hide his pill in a bit of food.
Like our Grammy Moon used to get grandad to take his heart medicine.
If he had heart problems, why wouldn't he want to take his medicine?
Don't think that nosy coroner didn't ask the same question!
Num-nums, Eddie.
Oh, he's a good boy.
Normally I don't believe in popping pills for every little upset.
I quite agree!
My nerves are bothered by this constant thundering, too but I would never turn to drugs to calm down.
Oh, mommy!
Hey Niles, you're not going to believe what happened to Frasier.
-Oh, I heard the whole thing.
-You listen to Bulldog's program?
Yes, Dad, I can't sleep nights till I find out who hurled what ball through what apparatus.
No, no, no, no, it was on at the vet's.
You would think that in a city with this much rain that people would develop an etiquette about it, but no!
They buy umbrellas that are too big for them you have to walk into the street to get around them and then they drive too close to the curb so that you're sure to get splashed!
And they wear brown shoes with white socks!
What has that got to do with the rain?
Nothing!
But I mean, really, get a fashion sense!
-Well, I guess things didn't go too well at the station, huh?
No, they didn't.
It turned out the station manager is encouraging Bulldog's little pranks.
Now she wants me to return his fire on the air.
Well, I thought the idea was absurd at first but now I'm starting to warm to it.
I say have at him!
He's grossly overmatched but he did bring this on himself.
You know, you're right, Niles.
If I have to fight cheap and dirty on his own turf, then I will!
-And what is that supposed to mean?
-Well, I don't think it's a good idea.
You know, Bulldog's pretty good at this kind of thing.
-He's a funny guy.
-And, I'm not funny?
-I don't believe this!
-Well, now, obviously Dad's forgetting the time you took the names of our wine club board and turned them all into wickedly derisive anagrams!
"Sidney Ass Basket"!
-Now, you see, dad, I made you laugh.
-No, I'm looking at Eddie.
I guess he won't be needing a second pill!
Now, now, Frasier, don't get me wrong.
I think you're witty, you're clever but funny's different.
Funny's somebody who makes you laugh with your belly.
Now, Bulldog's funny.
Duke's cousin, Louie, now he's really funny!
He's like Jackie Gleason, only loud!
He makes you laugh so hard the beer comes out of your nose.
You know what feels good through the nose?
A warm cup of cocoa.
I just may go home for Christmas this year.
You know, just because I haven't caused anyone to blow beer through their nostrils doesn't mean that I can't.
Anyone who can compose a clever ballad can certainly master the intricacies of the whoopee cushion!
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
It's a lot harder than you think.
All right, you just tune into Bulldog's show tomorrow.
Pop open a beer and prepare for a Budweiser geyser!
You know, Frasier, if you're serious about that whoopee cushion I happen to have one at the house.
Last year a disgruntled servant left one on Maris's dining room chair.
Fortunately for all of us, embarrassment was averted when my little faun proved too light to activate it.
Well, it's six-thirty, sports fans.
That means it's time for our big SeaHawks tickets giveaway.
Yes, my curvaceous and bodacious assistant Darlene is rolling in our glittery giant prize draw right now.
Okay, Darlene, give it a good crank.
Whoa!
Honey, I meant the drum!
Here it comes, Roz, the hilarity ensues!
Okay, explain this to me one more time.
You were the one who's trying to prove to everyone you're so funny, so why am I the one who had to put the lizard in the box?
!
It was just as difficult to be the lookout!
Stop whining!
Hey, look who's here.
It's our new boss lady, KACL's own Kate Costas!
-Kate's there?
Oh, Frasier, Kate's there!
No, no, it's even better.
Even better that she will be an eyewitness to my little jape!
Come in, Kate.
-Yeah, here we go, glad you dropped in.
-Hello, Bulldog.
Hi, Darlene.
Wow, look at that mighty drum!
Yeah, give it a good spin!
Look at those cards going round and round.
Okay, Seattle and the winner is -Hey, Kate, why don't you pick it?
-Okay.
And the lucky winner is -Something bit me!
-Oh my God!
It's a lizard!
-Man, it's got your fingertip -Oh, God!
-I'll get some ice.
There it goes, there it goes, there it goes!
Stop that lizard, it has my finger!
Roz!
Any news?
-Oh, yeah.
They sewed her fingertip back on.
She's gonna be fine.
Frasier, would you wipe that guilty look off your face?
-No-one even suspects you.
-Why not?
Because you made such a big deal about how playing pranks was beneath you!
Oh, they're not only beneath me, they're beyond me.
I'm going to accept my limitations and be satisfied to merely be witty and urbane.
Even my most barbed comments never drew blood!
-Oh God, I feel sick.
-You do?
When the lizard threw up her fingertip who had to pack it in frozen yogurt and rush it down here?
!
-I'm going to tell her the truth.
-What?
!
Are you insane?
I've got to unburden myself.
Frasier, you didn't start this.
You are the victim here.
Why should you have to suffer any more than you already have?
-I'll keep your name out of it!
-Fine, do what you want.
I don't know when I'll be back in the office, Susan.
Just cancel all my appointments.
Is there any word on who pulled this stupid stunt?
I don't want excuses, I want names!
Will you hurry up that shot.
-I'm in agony here.
-Kate I see that your strength is back.
I brought you some flowers.
What kind of raving psychotic -would do a thing like this?
-You know people use that word "psychotic" an awful lot these days.
A kid steals a candy bar, suddenly he's a psychotic.
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna crush him!
Are you sure that's enough?
Make sure that all goes in!
Call me if you need anything.
Well, Kate, I came here for a reason.
Oh, let me guess, someone park in your space?
No, but if someone had, I would have forgiven him -just as I'm sure you will forgive -Who?
Well, I'm sure the poor misguided prankster that perpetrated this evil deed really had no ill will in mind.
It wasn't his or her You know that Nanette from "Pet Chat" she had a real axe to grind!
-What?
-What?
-You giggled.
-Oh, it was kinda funny.
-What?
-What?
-What's funny?
-Oh, I was just remembering -What?
-What?
Oh, oh, the shot's kicking in, isn't it?
Wouldn't you know, it bites my middle finger.
How am I supposed to drive?
You know, Kate, maybe now would be a good time Now you know, life is so funny.
One minute, you're standing in a hallway the next minute you're a poo-poo platter for a lizard.
That's a funny word, isn't it?
Hallway!
-You want to hear something really funny?
-And Bulldog Bulldog's Oh, see, now, you're starting to get tired, I should go.
Kate, Kate, before you go to sleep there's just one last funny thing I want to tell you O-kay!
-I put the lizard in the box.
-O-kay.
Oh, God!
-It's alive!
-You what?
Well, I, it was meant for Bulldog.
It was all an accident, I never intended to Kate?
Kate?
Nurse!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
-Roz, who's our last caller?
-On line two we have Marilyn.
-She's feeling a little homesick.
-Go ahead, Marilyn.
Well, I like living in Seattle but, I don't know I grew up in this little town in Wisconsin and I really miss that life.
Well, you're not the only one.
My producer Roz has regaled me with many stories of the great Dairy State.
You're from Wisconsin, Roz?
What part?
-Bloomer.
-Oh my God, I'm from Monomeney.
No way!
You're from Menomonie?
My cousins are from Menomonie, do you know the Rayburns?
Billy Rayburn is your cousin?
I used to work with him at Bell's Frozen Custard!
Do you remember that guy that used the run the store with all the moles?
Mr. Sneedy.
Ladies, as fascinating as this is, I'm afraid we're out of time.
That's okay, Marilyn, you can call back tomorrow.
Make sure you all tune in tomorrow for Part 2 in our series, "Women of the Cheese Belt".
Goodbye for now, and good mental health.
These messages came for you earlier, your wines are ready.
Oh, excellent.
I'm hosting a tasting tonight for the wine club Niles and I belong to.
I'm hoping they name me the Maitre d'Chai.
It's a long-standing dream of mine to wear that silver cup around my neck.
You know, back in Wisconsin if a guy wore a cup around his neck -it meant he'd ticked off the gym teacher.
-Fine!
Make sport, but this does happen to be important to me.
Since when?
You used to say that club was nothing but a bunch of arrogant cork-sniffing snobs.
Well, that was before I got in.
Well, when I'm handing out baloney sandwiches this weekend at the homeless shelter it will do me heart good to know that a bunch of wealthy men are swishing two-hundred-dollar bottles of wine and spitting it into silver buckets!
It's not like we don't recycle the bottles.
Bottle six.
Big, full-bodied, nicely baked.
Essence of truffles, long finish -Chambertin 76'.
-Bravo, Frasier.
If only your aim were as accurate.
How is it those same taste buds can't tell the difference between my pot roast and my flank steak?
Well, considering you learned to cook in England it's a wonder I can tell your flank steak from a braised tennis ball.
Now, now, let's move on to the number seven.
Ah, touch of oak.
Hint of currant.
Whisper of what is that, what is that?
Oh yes, wet dog!
You guys still playing that stupid game?
Dad, wine tasting is not a stupid game - it's a highly refined skill.
Yeah, I just saw a couple of guys on the corner practising out of paper bags.
We're hardly winos.
Some very distinguished people belong to our club.
The mayor, the commissioner of public safety the chief of surgery at St. Lukes Oh, just the people I want walking around all liquored up.
Could you find room for a school bus driver and a couple of air traffic controllers?
Well, we would if they had impeccable taste.
Which reminds me dad, I have a favour to beg.
Would you mind if I moved your chair into your room -until after the tasting?
-Forget it you might as well ask me to stay in my room.
Which takes care of the second favour.
Oh, all right, move it.
At least I don't have to spend the night watching your society pals getting tanked.
Okay, Niles, grab an end.
-Oh, you're serious.
You know I don't lift.
-Yes with that stick where it I'm surprised you can bend.
Start hoisting.
-Oh, God!
-No Niles, don't drop it!
You better be talking about the floor.
Oh, of course I'm talking about the floor Oh, for Pete's sake, it's just a little scratch.
Get me a yellow magic marker.
I'll color it in, no one'll know the difference.
Dad, you have no idea how critical these people can be.
They love finding fault.
We could put a rug over it.
A rug?
Where a rug doesn't belong?
Why don't you just throw down a Twister mat.
Have a few rounds between vintages?
!
Steady Frasier, there's still hope.
I'll bring my contractor by in the morning.
The man's a genius.
You know, it's time you guys learned everything doesn't have to be perfect.
Yes, it's that kind of advice that leads to shag carpeting!
Ah, good morning Daphne.
Extra pancakes for me this morning!
I'm famished!
Yes, well you should have thought about that last night before you started making cracks about English cooking.
I have hung up my spatula.
Well, you moved my chair, you cut off my pancake supply; why don't you just back out over Eddie on your way to work and make it a hat trick?
And a hat trick would be?
-It's in hockey where one player -Enough said, thank you.
-Niles.
-Good morning, Frasier.
I'm delivering one miracle worker as promised.
-Joe DeCarlo, Frasier Crane.
And my father, Martin Crane.
-Hi, Joe.
-Where's the scratch?
-Oh, you mean you didn't see it?
We were going to put some orange cones around it so nobody would fall in it!
It's right here.
-I can get rid of that.
-It has to be done by five.
My guests arrive at seven, so it has to be a firm five.
Not a five-fifteen or a five-thirty.
-I'll be done by noon.
-Splendid.
-I told you he was good.
We're talking about a man who has satisfied Maris.
Something that's still regrettably on my to-do list!
Coffee's ready.
Of course, I'm sure it'll taste like my old bath water to you.
You know, how it gets all grey and scummy around the edges with little flecks of Oh, hello.
-Hi.
-Hello.
I'd love some coffee, Daphne.
Hmm, Daphne?
Er, Daph, this is Joe DeCarlo.
Joe, this is Daphne.
She helps me out around here.
-Smells great.
Columbian?
-No, English.
-The coffee - Costa Rican.
Would you like a cup?
-Thanks.
I'll be right back.
-He's adorable, talk me up.
-A plate of pancakes.
-Deal.
You know, Joe, Daphne's a great gal.
-You know, she doesn't always go round in that ratty old bathrobe.
She cleans up real cute.
-You don't have to convince me.
-You know, I think dad's right you don't need to fix that scratch, it adds character.
Come, Joe.
-Niles, forget it!
-Honeybun?
-Yes.
-I meant would you like one of these with your coffee?
-Oh, I'd love one.
-Anything?
-No.
-Sugar?
-Yes.
I meant in the coffee.
Maris is quite keen on gutting my library to make more space for her hats.
Why don't you come home with me and you can send one of your men over to do this little job.
Bruce would be good.
The large sweaty gentleman with the chili dogs on his breath.
Niles, Joe is here already and we do have a deadline.
-But don't you think it would be prudent -Niles, it's settled.
-That's great because I'm kinda anxious to get at her.
I'll just bet he is -the testosterone is just dripping -Niles.
-Niles, he's talking about the scratch.
-I knew that!
Only I know that!
I mean, watch him!
-Someone remodelling?
-No, bad wiring in one of the condos.
Ah, well I hope you won't be here this evening.
I'm entertaining some very important guests and you know how sound travels in this building.
Ah, can't make any promises.
We're here as long as this poor sap is willing to pay us.
-What is happening?
-Hold on, guys.
Er, sorry about this, Dr. Crane but I plugged in the sander to start on the floor, you blew a circuit.
So naturally you're sawing a hole into my wall.
The circuit blew - it started a fire.
You've got some real bad wiring in here.
-But how long?
-A couple of hours.
-"A couple" is vague.
That would mean the big hand would be on the twelve -and the little hand would be?
-On the four.
On the four?
Oh, the four is okay, fine.
You know the fire, Eddie smelled it first.
Oh, well he's a regular canary in a coal mine, isn't he!
-My God, what's going on?
-Don't ask, Niles.
Oh, I see you've got the Romani Containe.
Yes, but unfortunately they only had the one bottle.
That's funny -the importer told me he had two.
-Really?
How strange.
You know, if I didn't know you better I would swear you had squirreled one away for yourself.
But then we both know that you must be telling the truth because you're such a slave to your ethics that even the slightest transgression would cause your nose to bleed.
Which it isn't!
-You just sniffed.
-I didn't sniff, it was a snort of contempt.
A snort is out, that was in.
Oh, alright - the other bottle's in the car -in my bowling bag.
-Thank you.
You have a bowling bag?
Yes.
Maris and I have taken to giving each other gag gifts.
I gave her a cook book.
Oh, yoohoo.
I noticed how your shirt was clinging to your back and -I thought a nice cup of iced tea might hit the spot.
-Thanks, Daph.
-Ho-ho, I got a spark.
-Me, too.
That's just static electricity from the carpet - it can happen to anyone.
-I'll show you.
-Niles?
!
Stop poking me!
Should I put these little fingery foods for tonight in the fridge?
Oh, yes please - the Brie is sweating up a storm.
Let me help you with those.
No Daphne, let me help you.
Excuse me, Bruce.
Spark!
Spark!
Did you see the I will be back after work at five-thirty - I hope I have your word that my apartment will be perfect for then.
-Okay.
Alright, think think before you answer.
This is not like marriage vows or a promise to a dying parent.
This really, really counts.
-You have my word.
-Thank you.
God, I'm sweating like a pig.
I've got to air myself out.
Hey, hold the elevator, will ya?
I'm sorry, I need this nose tonight, thank you.
You don't have to keep feeding these men.
Actually, Maris finds they work faster if you keep them hungry.
Hee hee, I don't mind.
Of course, I probably don't cook as well as their wives or girlfriends.
That is, if they all have girlfriends.
I'm sure Joe's probably mentioned some girl to you.
-No.
-Really?
That is not any one girl.
Not old "love'em and leave'em" Joe.
From what I've heard, he's wrecked more homes than he's fixed.
Mimsie Stanshope has him over all the time and I don't just mean to strip her entryway.
-Oh, I see.
-I'm sorry, Daphne.
No, it's better I should know now before I get my hopes up.
Thank you for being honest with me.
-Joe -Dr. Crane, don't panic, I can explain everything.
-Wonderful.
Perhaps you can explain these legs.
That's Cecil.
He's the best ceiling guy in Seattle.
We were lucky to get him.
When we opened up the wall to get to the faulty wiring we found that the gas pipes leading to your fireplace were cracked.
-Had to be fixed.
-Tonight?
-I OK'd it.
It just seemed wiser to do it before the explosion.
Frasier, the club members arrive in forty-five minutes.
Have you lost your Cecil!
Niles, don't yell at me.
If you were able to lift anything heavier than an emory board we wouldn't be in this position.
Maybe next time you'll listen to your old man.
Thank you, dad.
You know, I was just considering whether I should go shave or slit my wrists.
You made my choice a little easier.
Don't worry, we are gonna make it.
Only about that shaving.
We had to shut the water off to replace a valve.
Oh, well, that explosion idea's sounding better and better.
Could someone at least move that mantle piece away from the door!
Hello?
Just hold on, will you?
Hey Joe, you know you're going to be through by seven?
It gives you plenty of time for a dinner and a movie.
Excuse me I said I don't want to go out with you!
Whatcha looking at?
Get back to work!
-Thanks a lot!
-Why would she do that?
She's crazy about him!
Niles, is your nose bleeding?
No, no, I was just admiring Cecil's handiwork.
That was the mayor on the phone.
Apparently his wife can't make it tonight so he has invited Senator Adler!
-Can anything else possibly go wrong?
-Take a look at that.
Oh, dear God.
Is that blood on my floor?
And another drop.
Niles!
Well?
Is it terribly wrong to mislead someone even if it is for his or her own good?
What did you tell Daphne?
I made up a story that Joe seduces all the women he works for so she wouldn't go out with him.
Oh Niles, how could you be so selfish?
I didn't do it for me, I did it for her.
She deserves a doctor, or a lawyer someone for whom a T-shirt is an undergarment.
Look, I don't know what sort of twisted fantasy you've concocted about you and Daphne.
I suppose it involves a comet hitting the earth and you and she having to rebuild the species!
But trust me, Niles, it is not going to happen.
She needs a man - one who can do more for her than just smell her hair.
-Daphne!
-What are you going to do?
-You are going to fix this.
-What am I going to tell her?
-Tell her the truth.
Only the truth shall make you clot.
-Yes, Dr. Crane?
-Yes Daphne, er Niles has something he wishes to discuss with you.
What is it, Dr. Crane?
Oh look, you have a spot on your tie.
Well, earlier, what I said about Joe I made a mistake.
He doesn't sleep around, he hasn't wrecked any homes and the business about Mimsie Stanshope Oh sorry is there a john around here to air out my paddle?
You can use the master bedroom.
-Joe never worked for Mimsie Stanshoe..
-He sure didn't.
I do all the work at Mimsie's.
She is one tough lady to satisfy.
It's you?
I'm the only guy that can make her happy, everyone knows that.
Jeez.
So, that was the mistake you heard.
Those stories you heard weren't about Joe They were about Bruce?
Hard to believe, isn't it?
But you know, when society women go slumming they go all the way!
So, you can tell Joe that you've changed your mind about going out with him.
-Oh no, I couldn't.
What would I say?
-Just tell him the truth.
Tell him that I heard stories that he No, bad idea!
Here.
You wait here.
-Joe.
-Yep?
You have to ask Daphne out again.
-Are you nuts?
You heard what she said.
-Yes but if you ask her again; she'll say yes.
Hey, maybe I've changed my mind.
Oh no, you haven't changed your mind.
You're just letting masculine vanity and hurt feelings keep you from something that other men can only dream of in their oxblood seated leather wingback chair with the lights off.
Look, Dr. Crane, I just don't think it'll work out - okay?
No, it's not okay.
If you had ever smelt her hair you'd know she's worth at least one more try.
She is an angel, and she is a goddess and she's waiting for you in the bathroom.
You got a minute?
I'm never going to make it.
Daphne, would you please get that?
Jeez, I thought you were just going to slit your wrists.
It looks like you went for "death of a thousand cuts".
I cut myself because I was shaving without water.
And why was there no water?
Because I had to move your chair which gouged the floor, which made me call for Joe who found bad pipes, who called for Cecil who ate the cat that killed the rat that lived in the house that Frasier built!
That was the doorman.
Senator Adler's limousine just pulled up.
Oh, it's over, it's over.
Sing, fat lady, sing.
Frasier, what are we going to do?
Will you give me your cash?
Both of you, come on!
-Hurry up!
-Why?
Never mind why, just hand it to me.
Come on, be quick, Niles.
Oh all right, do you want all seven hundred dollars?
You carry seven hundred dollars in your wallet?
Well, Maris asked me to stop by the drugstore later.
Just hand it over.
Okay, guys.
I've got seven hundred and some odd dollars here.
If you can get everything cleared up before Frasier's buddies get here it's yours to split any way you want on your way out.
Bribery?
That's your big plan?
Oh my God, it's starting to work!
Hey, here's another hundred I was holding out on my old man!
-Dr. Crane.
-Yes?
-Joe told me what you did.
I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Thank you.
-Did you feel that?
We made a spark.
-Oh yes, we did.
I guess you were right, it is just the carpet!
Okay everybody, come on.
Move it, move it, move it.
We're out of here.
-Are you ready?
-Good night.
Goodnight Daphne, have a good time.
Oh, my God, we did it, we actually did it.
Oh dad, please don't leave, I'd like you to stay.
I mean, you helped me to get this put together tonight.
Oh well, thanks Fras.
That makes me feel good.
Not good enough to hang around that bleeding-heart-softie-on-crime Senator Adler, but good.
Come on Eddie, the politicians are coming!
They're here.
Senator Adler, Mayor - welcome to my humble abode.
You know you're out of T.P. in the can?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Well, my husband is always criticising me because in restaurants I like to listen in on strangers' conversations.
I don't know why he makes such a big deal out of nothing.
Well June, I suppose your lack of interest makes your husband feel invisible.
Imagine what it must be like to sit across from someone who's constantly scanning, searching craning their neck to see Just what the hell is going on out there?
Oh gosh, you're right!
I've been insensitive.
It's just common decency -to stay focused on the other person.
-Huh?
What?
-Oh, well, good for you, Jane!
-June!
-Oh, yeah, well, whatever!
Er, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
KACL 780.
What is going on?
Oh, our beloved station manager decided -we're not getting our raise this year!
-What?
This is an outrage!
I have a contract!
Don't palpitate, it doesn't apply to the on-air talent.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry I was being selfish, wasn't I?
I, er, feel very ashamed.
It is nevertheless er, an outrage.
It's not a personal outrage but certainly a, a family of man outrage.
Frasier, I spent that raise already - on my new diamond earrings!
I love them.
I love them so much, I slept with them!
Well, Roz, as long as you're doing it for love it's a step in the right direction!
Real supportive, Frasier!
We've been getting that raise every year and now this Nazi in nylons comes waltzing in here and cancels it with some vague crap about corporate belt-tightening.
This isn't fair!
Oh, oh, actually you're right!
Er you, maybe you should tell her what you just told me.
Er, except I would leave out the "Nazi in nylons" bit.
It's not your best icebreaker.
Oh, you're damn right we're gonna tell her!
-We've all been here a hell of a lot longer than she has!
-That's right!
She pushes us, we push back!
-She's standing right behind me, isn't she?
-Yeah.
Is there a problem?
Nope?
Good.
Kate?
-Doc?
-Er, these people would like to speak with you.
No, I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.
-I've got a meeting.
-Well I-I'm sorry, excuse me?
I think your meeting can wait five minutes.
Now they're a little upset about your memo.
-I think you should discuss it with them.
-Dr Crane I wrote the memo I signed the memo, I posted the memo.
If I had anything more to say, I would have put it -Anybody?
-In the memo?
-Bravo.
Okay.
If she wants to play tough, we'll play tough back.
We still have a lot of power here.
Now we could go on strike Look, look, you know er, I, I think you should listen to Roz.
Every year in exchange for your hard work you receive a five percent raise.
Now, you've fulfilled your part of the bargain.
She has blithely changed the deal.
In the 'hood, they call that "being dissed".
Yes, my streetwise friend.
-You have a right to stand up for yourselves.
-Okay.
We gonna do this?
Are we together?
-What's the point?
If we strike they'll just replace us.
They only care about the on-air people.
Aaah, so we'll get their support!
Frasier just said he's on our side!
I did?
Well, well, yes I, I did, I did, yes.
But my meagre endorsement is is meaningless without the support of the other talent.
Did you hear that?
Frasier's gonna get everyone on our side!
Er I, I'd love to, to help, but you know I'm already in hot water with that woman!
You can't ask me to raise a mutiny against her!
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one".
James Tiberius Kirk, Captain, Starship Enterprise.
Go away, you annoying little man.
Please?
Oh alright, alright!
You organise your people, I'll talk to mine!
Hey, beat it.
Hey, if you can't run with The Bulldog, stay on the porch.
-Niles.
-Good evening, Frasier.
You left your Mont Blanc in my car, so I Oh.
I see cocktails.
Hors d'oeuvres.
Mingling.
If I were the suspicious type I'd say you were throwing a party to which I was not invited.
-Feel like a wiener, Niles?
-Indeed I do.
Niles, this is not a party.
And dad, that is fourteen-dollar- a-pound andouille sausage.
Wow.
Means Eddie ate about thirty bucks' worth.
Niles, these people are colleagues from the station.
We're here to discuss a labour dispute.
Oh, well.
Fight on, people!
You know, there is no greater friend to the working man than my own Maris.
Remember, when our stable boy Wakim's appendix burst?
She had him driven back to the border at her own personal expense!
-Ah, good evening, Frasier!
-Gil, Sheryl, Floyd!
Oh!
What a stunning apartment!
The palette is pure, subtle elegance!
The detailing well, it's inspired!
And the furnishings Oh, dear.
Is that a chair?
-That is my father's chair.
-Oh.
Well this must be your father!
-Hi - Marty Crane.
You put on quite a show!
Oh, you've heard my little programme?
No, I mean just coming through the door.
Doc, doc!
Can we hurry this thing up?
I got a charity event tonight.
She's not much to look at, but what the hell.
Okay, well, since we're all here Er, now, regarding management's claim of financial distress I've done some checking around and I've found that the advertising revenues are up eleven-and-a-half per cent -Gil Chesterton, the restaurant critic!
-Yes.
Oh, I just love those wicked things you say when the food is bad!
Well, keep bringing these and you won't be disappointed!
The wage freeze is unwarranted.
It is simply a ploy of an overly ambitious station manager and typical of this woman!
She has terrorised us, she has tampered with our shows.
-It's time we said no to this Princess of Darkness!
-I got a better idea.
Why don't we just walk up to Mike Tyson and tell him he talks funny?
What about our support staff?
If we don't back this strike, they may lose their jobs!
They're powerless without our support.
Frasier, old man, why do they need raises?
You're talking about people who eat corn dogs and nachos.
That statement is appallingly elitist.
Well thank you, Mister Everyday People!
Hey, I'm sure we'd all like to help these people, but we need our jobs.
We're working stiffs too living from paycheck-to- paycheck just like they are.
Excuse me, someone's blocking me in downstairs.
Who has a BMW?
A red BMW.
-With a red interior.
-Oh, that's me!
Just give me your key; I'll leave it to the doorman.
-Oh, no no.
I was just leaving.
-Oh, I'm going too.
Where are your ethics?
Where's your conscience?
Where's your john?
I need to slap on some Canoe.
Hey, I'm with you people!
To heck with the workers.
-They're not yours!
-Hey, damn right!
And chances are, after the station manager crushes the little people she won't come after you big shots.
Right.
Why would she?
Well, I mean er, supposing she's trying to save money you're the big ticket items.
Erm, after all this, well, she won't have to worry about the support staff backing you guys up, will she?
Oh but no, that's crazy.
You're not suggesting that Kate might be coming after our money next?
No, she wouldn't do that!
She's a peach, right?
Soft as a cream puff.
And we all know no-one here is overpaid Suddenly, I'm feeling very Norma Rae.
Great!
I'll get us some more wine.
Dad, that was brilliant, using reverse psychology!
I guess living with me is rubbing off on you a little bit.
Well, I guess it's only natural that environmental factors -would influence personality development -Alright.
Well, oh wait I, I hope I didn't hit -some long-repressed Oedipal nerve -Very funny.
Because the last thing we want is for you to be sublimating your anger passive/aggressive Oh, alright!
Just stop it, you wise ass!
Ha-hey!
Looks like I'm rubbing off on you, too!
Alright, people!
I have spoken -with the on-air talent, and I -Shhh!
Ixnay, Dr Crane Ah, yes.
You've really dropped the cone of silence now.
Anyway, I have delivered on my promise: the talent is behind you.
If you strike, we strike.
All for one and one for all!
-Okay!
So who is our spokesperson - who is leading the charge?
-I am.
-You want to make something of it?
Oh shoot, I smiled again!
Rozalinda, a word.
Our leader is Noel Shempsky?
!
The man has all the backbone of a paramecium!
Well, do you think that it's my idea?
Noel and I were the only two who volunteered.
'Course, they voted me down.
I'm smarter than he is, more confident, more articulate but those stupid little wusses think I'm a hot-head!
But Noel, Roz!
A lot of people's jobs are riding on this - including mine!
-Then you do it!
-Me?
-Yes!
-No no, me?
-Oh, please!
Me?
No, no, I've done enough already, oh Dr Crane, I can see that you're concerned about my negotiating skills.
But don't be I have a secret weapon.
I can faint at will.
Check it out Okay people, there's been a coup.
I am now your leader!
To the lair of the She-Wolf!
Wow.
What have we here?
We are dissatisfied with the wage freeze and we demand to speak to you about it.
-Don't we?
-Yes!
Alright, but aren't you people still on the clock?
Well hi-ho the dairy-o, the cheese stands alone.
They're a shrewd group.
They only flex their muscles when they have to.
Well done!
Yeah, right.
Will you get in here?
I'm kinda surprised to see you here.
This really isn't your fight, is it?
I am honoured to have been chosen by my colleagues to speak for them.
Oh.
That's a shame.
I was kinda looking forward to seeing Shempsky faint.
Well, we have a lot to do, so we may as well just get to it Is that a, a new hairdo?
It's very fetching.
Oooh, is that a new tie?
It just lights up your pretty face.
Look, what is it about us?
I mean, why all this friction between us?
For my own part your intolerable smugness reminds me of my ex-wife.
But what is the source of your antipathy toward me?
Was there some intimidating male figure in your childhood?
A father?
A, a priest?
A department store Santa I don't know, I'm just spit-balling here!
-I have an idea about the source of our antagonism.
-Good.
Do let me hear it.
I'm a woman, I'm as smart as you, and I'm your boss.
-Coincidences, all!
Doc I don't want to analyse your hang-ups.
I already got a full-time job.
Let's just get down to business, okay?
Oh, very well.
There's really very little to discuss.
These people were promised a raise.
They have fulfilled their part of the bargain; it's time for you to honour yours.
-You have twenty-four hours.
-Or?
We walk, en masse.
Including the on-air talent.
-I've seen to that myself.
-You have.
-Why are you gunning for me?
-Gunning?
For you?
This isn't about you, it's about what you're doing to those people.
It's the shame of Seattle!
No, no; this is about your ego, which is the size of Seattle!
Every suggestion, every decision I've made has been met by this impenetrable wall of arrogance masquerading as righteousness.
That's a desperate shot attacking me because I have a social conscience!
No, what you have is a fat contract, and so do the rest of your cronies.
So when it came time for staff raises there was no more money left in the till!
Oh, you are twisting things to make it look like it's my fault!
Oh, it's true what they say: the devil comes disguised as a beautiful woman!
There would've been raises if you hadn't taken all the money to pay for those Armani suits.
Oh, oh, what about you?
Let's not overlook that pricey little Fendi scarf you're wearing!
Well, what about this designer cologne on you?
Well, how about those pouty lips that must have -cost you a fortune in collagen injections!
-These lips are mine -you arrogant gasbag!
-You intractable despot!
-Blowhard!
-Tyrant!
-Ass!
-Shrew!
Get out!
Now!
-Hey, Niles!
-Maris found a grey hair.
Daphne, get Niles a brandy.
It was right at the apex of her widow's peak.
Better bring the bottle!
She blames me, dad.
She said it's from the stress I caused her last night when I thoughtlessly turned on the light while she was getting undressed.
Oh!
Good evening, Dr Crane!
Oh, let me take that for you.
After all, you are the friend of the working man!
Thank you, Daphne.
-Defender of the little people -Alright, Daphne Standing up to the boss on behalf of the downtrodden selflessly risking your own Don't you have some meat to boil?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I apologise, it's just been a, a, a bad day.
I was elected by the employees to present our demands to, to Kate.
Oh well, that was a smart move!
Did you give her a good tongue-lashing?
-In a manner of speaking, yes.
-I'm proud of you, son.
No, don't be, dad - I'm a fraud.
I, I was in her office tempers flared and the next thing I knew, we werelocked in a -passionate kiss!
-Ooooh, go on!
Daphne, I'm really not that comfortable talking about this in front of you.
Oh, no need to be shy around me.
I'm a professional health care worker!
I've seen it all!
I've helped your father in and out of the bathtub.
Okay, Daphne -I've seen his bits!
-Hey!
Oh, for God's sake!
Just tell her, will you?
Frasier: Oh, alright.
It was like nothing I've ever experienced before.
It was just pure sex!
Overwhelming, unexpected, animal-like!
Oh well, that!
We've all experienced that, who hasn't?
Pfff!
I'm no stranger to that feeling meself.
It can strike without warning.
And you don't know who it will be!
Why, you could be standing next to a person month after month and then the next thing you know you're tearing each other's clothes off!
-There's a word for it -Hope.
Oh, this is madness!
I'm actually lusting after a woman that does nothing but grate on my nerves.
I can't stand her!
Oh really, Dr Crane!
Would a man want to have sex with a woman he doesn't even like?
-Yes!
-Absolutely!
Maybe she's been harbouring feelings for me.
Is it possible that she could have been lusting after me all this time?
Oh, it could be.
But you know, you were in the middle of a negotiation.
Maybe she laid that smackeroo on you just to rattle your brain.
Dad has a point.
Your musk-drenched animal magnetism aside it's quite possible that she was simply manipulating you.
Oh, I hardly think so.
The woman's passion seemed genuine.
Yes - it always does.
Do you suppose it's possible she's just using sex to sway me to her side?
Well, figure it out.
Who made the first move?
You or her?
There was no first move.
It was more like spontaneous sexual combustion.
-There's always a first move.
Think.
-Alright.
I was standing in front of her desk like so.
She was facing me Niles, you be Kate.
-I will not.
-Look, just stand up!
I'm always the girl!
In every prep school play I was the girl!
Guinevere, Marian the Librarian, Ado Annie.
Well, no more.
I'm through with it!
When do I get to be Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo'?
!
This is getting menowhere!
Alright.
I'll just have to go down there and confront her myself.
Find out if what she was feeling was actually genuine or she was simply being a conniving femme fatale!
Oh, come on now, Dr Crane!
It's not like men have never used sex to get what they want.
How can we possibly use sex to get what we want?
!
Sex is what we want!
-Kate.
-Frasier.
-Er I think we have some issues to discuss.
-Me too.
Have a seat.
-I'd prefer to stand.
-Me too.
-Let's talk about the kiss.
-Yeah.
Let's.
-Alright.
Why did it happen?
Some possibilities: Er, frustration; passion; the stress of the situation; -Manipulation.
-Manipulation That is interesting.
-What's interesting is that you focused on manipulation.
Why?
-Because there's a possibility of manipulation.
-So, you admit -that you were manipulating me!
-Me?
I'm talking about you!
How dare you think I'd do a thing like that!
Well, it's not unheard of for a woman like you to use her feminine wiles to get what she wants.
Oh, very clever!
What about you using your masculine wiles to get what you want?
You think my wiles are masculine?
No, I am not going down that road again.
'Course you're not.
Because at the end of that road is a cul-de-sac of vulnerability.
That's not you, is it?
-No, you're cement-hard.
-"Cul-de-sac of vulnerability"?
Alright, listen.
You see me for a couple of hours out of every day and you think you know me?
The me me?
Alright, I can be tough - okay, I've gotta be.
I can also be tender spontaneous shy lusty -playful.
-Kittenish?
I could climb you like a scratching post.
Damn it!
Stop!
What are we doing?
!
Now there are people out there counting on us!
Right, you're absolutely right.
We've gotta put personal pleasure aside until we get this thing resolved.
Absolutely.
We owe it to them.
If it takes every minute of every hour of every day and every ounce of strength we have we have got to settle this strike!
Alright.
Those people deserve a five percent raise.
-I'll give you three.
-Four!
-Done.
-Hey, any news?
-Frasier's hanging tough!
-He just keeps pounding that desk and saying, "More, more, more"!
-Okay!
Good news.
-She's offered three percent.
-Take it!
-No, never!
I'm going to get you four!
I don't care if I have to stay in there all night!
Frasier!
Frasier!
Frasier!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Previously on Frasier What is going on?
Oh, our beloved station manager decided we're not getting our raise this year!
-You intractable despot!
-Ass!
-Shrew!
you know, you were in the middle of a negotiation.
Maybe she laid that smackeroo on you just to rattle your brain.
we have got to settle this strike!
Alright.
Those people deserve a five percent raise.
-I'll give you three.
-Four!
-Done.
-Frasier!
-Damn, I didn't think you'd be here Well, I would've gone to my regular haunt but "The Pig 'N Swig" is closed for remodelling.
I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I'm meeting Kate here.
We want to discuss the little dilemma in which we find ourselves.
If you're talking about the little kiss you two shared that hardly constitutes a dilemma.
-It's not as if you plunged into a tawdry office affair.
-No.
-Then you'd have a real problem.
-Yes.
-A kiss?
It's nothing.
-Right.
Had sex with her, didn't you?
I didn't mean to!
It just happened!
One minute we were negotiating the next minute our inhibitions were shattered along with my kneecap and her Macintosh PowerBook.
-This happened in her office?
-Yes.
-What are you saying?
-Her couch folds out?
-We used her desk.
-Her desk folds out?
!
-There she is!
Look, look, just make an excuse and go, okay?
-Alright, okay.
Ah, Miss Costas.
-Dr. Crane.
Oh, look at the time!
I, er, have a session with my multiple personality.
Well, not to worry.
If I'm late he can just talk amongst himself.
-So good morning.
-Good morning.
-How's your knee?
-Ah.
Well er, it's better, thanks.
And and your laptop?
I refer to your computer.
A little dented, but fine.
The computer.
Ah.
Anyway, what I wanted to tell you was that well, last night was one of the greatest nights of lovemaking I've had since -Roz!
-Tell me she just walked in.
Well, hi!
Guess you guys kissed and made up, huh?
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.
We were just discussing the step system in a new healthcare plans co-payment scheme and -well, it wouldn't interest you.
-Oh, the hell it wouldn't!
You know they're too cheap to pay for a butt-lift?
I sit on this thing all day long, that's work-related!
Listen, I really have to go.
But I would like to discuss this matter at the first possible opportunity.
So would I. I almost forgot.
I need you two to fill in the eight-to-ten slot tonight.
Floyd, the Happy Chef, is in rehab again.
Oh, great.
I was supposed to have dinner with a successful, handsome doctor!
She thinks we're all as happy to work all night as she is.
Well, you're a psychiatrist, Frasier.
She's a cold, repressed workaholic who has no sex life whatsoever.
Can't you help her?
I've tried, Roz.
Why do we bother having a service elevator?
I just rode up nineteen floors with two sweaty moving men munching on chili-dogs which they proceeded to drip onto my suede shoes.
How will I ever get that stain out?
Ah, yes.
Dog saliva!
Nature's miracle solvent.
So who's moving out anyway?
Deirdre Sauvage, the one who writes the romance novels.
Yeah, the lost Gabor sister's finally outta here.
Well, she's a very sweet person and I'm going to miss her.
Well, you're not the one she's always undressing with her eyes.
She lured me into her apartment one time, supposedly to fix a lamp.
Next thing I know, I got a drink in my hand and she's reading me a dirty poem about meadow walks.
Well, I must admit she's never done that to me.
Yeah well, if she does, don't fake a charley horse to get outta there.
She'll just try to rub it!
Speaking of romance, Dr. Crane when I washed your shirt this morning I couldn't help noticing lipstick in the oddest places.
I'll take it negotiations went well last night?
-I'd rather not discuss it, thank you.
-Why, is there a problem?
Things between me and Kate just went a little faster than I intended.
I'll say!
There were also four buttons missing and teeth-marks in the shoulders!
Thank you, Inspector Moon!
Things got a little out of hand.
I think we should slow down a bit but er I'm afraid to tell her for fear of hurting her feelings.
Daphne, how about a woman's perspective?
Let's just say, for argument's sake, that you and I succumbed to a a night of passion -What, you and me?
-Yes What - bosoms heaving, shirt buttons catapulting through the air?
It's a hypothetical question!
-I'll say it is!
-Oh, alright, somebody else!
Alright?
So, you have a, a mad tryst with this young man and then the next day he says that he thinks things are going too fast.
He'd like to slow down.
What would you say?
I suppose I'd say, "Thanks for being honest.
You're probably right, we were moving too fast".
"Not that it was too fast for you last night.
Ohh, no, we were right on schedule then, weren't we"?
"But, now you've had your fun - though not too much, apparently and you want to be my friend.
Well you can just sod off, Trevor Mulgrew!
!
"!
You know, I think I might have some buttons for this shirt You see, dad - the whole thing's a minefield.
Ah, you'll never learn, will you?
Handling a woman's easy!
You know, you kill me.
Mister Psychiatrist, you've always gotta make everything so complicated.
A woman comes on too strong, you just tell her to cool her engines!
It's the easiest thing in the world.
-Oh, Deirdre!
-I understand you're leaving us.
-Alas, yes!
Oh, do come in!
Thank you.
Ohhh hello, Martin!
You've been so kind to me - I wanted to give you my new address.
Oh, great!
I'd hate to lose touch!
I also wanted to bring you a farewell gift.
My latest novel, "Foolish Escapade".
It's the long-awaited sequel to "The Rose and the Rapier".
-Swell!
-I was er, thinking of you when I created the character of Lorenzo, the lovesick gondolier How 'bout that?
Hah!
Hey, where are my manners?
Let me show you out!
Oh, by the way, the lock on my suitcase is jammed.
I was er, hoping that you'd come and -tinker with it?
-Oh gee, you know, I'd love to, Deirdre.
But I I promised Frasier I'd do something with him tonight.
Oh oh, dad, didn't I mention it?
I'm filling in for The Happy Chef tonight -so, you're all hers!
-Oh, marvelous!
Goodnight, Lorenzo.
Hello, Polly.
-How can I help you?
-Oh, I'm so glad I got through!
I'm sitting here not knowing what to do.
I find myself lacking a certain spice.
Well Polly, if you want to shake up your routine, why don't you er try something new and dangerous?
Er, skydiving, belly-dancing, perhaps?
That ought to add some spice.
What are you talking about?
!
I'm making an apple tart and I'm out of cinnamon!
I see.
Listeners for the fourth time this hour I am not The Happy Chef.
I am The Irritated Psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane!
We'll be right back after the news.
And while we're on the subject of tarts I'm really sorry about that call.
No, it's alright, Roz.
Why don't you just run along for your date?
I can handle the last ten minutes here.
-Are you sure?
-Sure!
I mean, I feel terrible leaving you here alone in the lurch.
We are a team, Frasier; you just say the word and I'll stay Hey, hold that elevator!
Got a minute?
Oh, yes.
Er, look, I, I'm glad you're still here.
Er, listen No-no-no, me first this time.
Okay.
I really think that we should slow things down.
Oh, I am so glad you said that!
I wanted to say the same thing but I was I was afraid that you'd feel I was rejecting you!
Oh, how sensitive.
And yet, at the same time, how full of yourself.
You are one tough nut, lady.
-Well, all this definitely shows we're doing the right thing.
-Agreed.
Frankly, now that we've got that settled -do you mind if I ask you a question about last night?
-Yeah.
-What the hell was that?
!
-I have no idea!
I ever since I've gotten here you have done nothing but irritate me like a persistent skin rash.
Yes, and you me!
And, and, and last night was no different.
You just kept talking and talking and talking and I guess that mouth of yours just ticked me off so much I just had to have it!
-The whole thing it's just, it's so primitive!
-Yeah, yeah -animal!
We were just functioning on instinct.
-It's fascinating, really.
Oh, oh, let's not dismiss the element of danger.
All those people outside that could have walked in any moment -and caught us.
-That crossed my mind For once, in my cautious, buttoned-down life I felt like a real bad boy.
I felt like a dirty girl.
-What did you just call yourself?
-I said "dirty girl".
You bad boy.
You dirty girl.
You bad boy!
-Dirty girl!
-Bad boy!
-Dirty girl!
How much time do we have left on the news?
Three minutes.
But that's alright, I can play lots of extra commercials!
In local news, Congressman Robert Gill was accused of accepting bribes from a waste treatment facility.
Asked to comment, the congressman said- Yes!
Yes!
I am a bad boy, aren't I you dirty girl!
Come to your bad boy!
Oh, yes Oh, no!
-Is that the on-air light?
-Stop talking.
-You must have hit the switch with your elbow while we were -Stop talking!
-We'd better hurry up and get dressed while we still -Stop talking!
Okay, Fabio I want two things.
One: you will never make another crack about my sex life.
I don't care if I start dating a lumber camp.
-Done.
-And two: who's Dirty Girl?
-I can't tell you that.
-Oh, come on, Frasier!
I swear, I won't tell a soul!
Yes?
Not yet, I'll call you back.
Doc -I got one thing to say to you -Go ahead, take your best shot.
I am so proud of you, man.
-Well, doesn't that just put the cherry on the parfait.
-Now come on you gotta tell me who's the mystery chick?
Bulldog, haven't you already seen?
I've told half a dozen reporters that I'm not going to name names.
Yeah, don't you see this right here?
"'I Won't Fink,' Says Kinky Shrink".
-Good afternoon, Dr Crane.
-Miss Costas.
Hey, hey, you're the boss - make him tell who his playmate was.
Bulldog, this is really none of your business.
Oh, but we got a pool going.
-So far, hot money's on Roz.
-What?
!
Oh, well, thank you but I think I have a little more self-respect than to have a quickie with a co-worker on the air!
What kind of slut do they think I am?
Dr. Crane, could I have a word with you in private?
Er, I-I'd love that, but I, I've got my show in two minutes.
Actually you don't.
-What?
-I'm suspending you for a week.
-Bulldog, you're going on.
Roz, you'll have to produce.
-Alright!
I must say, I find that a, a bit harsh -all things considered.
-Yes, I can see how you might feel that way.
But the station does have certain standards and it is my job to enforce them.
Now if you will excuse me, I have to meet with one of last night's sponsors.
The Wholesome Family Cookie Company.
Hey!
Turn those lights out!
-Why?
-Deirdre hasn't finished moving yet.
If she sees the light in here, she'll know I'm home!
You can see your living room from her bedroom.
-Her bedroom?
-She had me cornered in there yesterday.
I don't mind telling you, I haven't been that scared since Korea.
Don't worry, dad.
Look, I have no intention of letting anyone in here tonight.
There's a damn tabloid news crew down in the lobby.
I had to go in the back way and use the service elevator.
Say, I tuned in to your show tonight.
Why weren't you on it?
-If you must know, I've been suspended for a week.
-Oh, no.
I spent the last three hours at the observation deck of the Space Needle.
Looking down on a city that's looking down on me.
-Hello, Dr Crane.
-Daphne.
I'm not here.
Yes.
Your father's not here either.
It's so nice having the whole house to myself.
-Daphne.
-Oh, how lovely.
Now the whole family's not here.
I listened to your programme as I was driving home last night.
Here's a bill to replace the front wheel of my Mercedes and the second to replace the back bumper..
of some wretched little domestic car.
-Go easy on your brother, Niles - he's had a rough day.
-You're right, dad.
Er, Frasier, please accept my apologies.
I, I can imagine how trying this must have been for you.
Thanks, Niles.
'Course, it's been no picnic for those of us who share your name.
My Maris took it particularly hard.
When I left this morning she was ordering new stationery with an accent aigu over the "e" in our name.
Hereafter, her memos will read, "From the desk of Maris CranÃ©".
-Who is it?
-Kate Costas.
-Wait, wait!
Alright, all of you.
You know nothing about last night!
-Hello!
-Hello.
-Come in!
Hello, Kate.
Er, you know Niles, of course.
Er, this is my father, Martin and er, his healthcare worker.
Daphne, Kate Costas.
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm sorry if I'm coming at a bad time.
Oh no, no, I, I - we were just taking Eddie for a walk.
Eddie!
I have to be running along too.
Oh, what's that on your chin?
Have you been in the garbage again?
You Bad Boy!
So nice place.
-Whoa, what a view!
-Yes.
I'll be enjoying it during my suspension.
Well I guess that concludes the small-talk portion of our evening.
-Look, it must be obvious; I've come here to apologise.
-Oh, really.
For what?
Turning on me when I went out of my way to protect you?
You know we're both responsible for this.
Yet I end up looking like an idiot and you look like a no-nonsense boss!
Alright, alright, just tell me what I can do to make this right.
Nothing!
There is nothing you can do there is nothing you can say, to make this up to me.
-The owners wanted you fired.
-That's pretty good!
Look, there's no way we can rewrite the past.
It happened, we did it, it's on tape.
But we can do this: we can prevent it from ever happening again.
Agreed.
Obviously, there's some kind of incredible attraction between us.
The trick will be simply to avoid the opportunity.
We're strong we're intelligent -and we're alone in this apartment.
-I'll get my bag!
-Yes Oh Kate, Kate, er, that news crew's probably still in the lobby.
Let me walk you to the service elevator and see you out.
-Going down?
-No, you guys go ahead.
Just send it back up!
Yes well, I'm sure if we really try we can keep things on a professional footing.
-We're two mature adults.
-Just have to avoid all undue temptation.
-What's going on?
-I don't know.
Hello?
You know, let's have a little light.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
-Yeah!
What's going on?
-Looks like you're stuck.
Same thing happened this morning.
Took about half an hour to fix.
-You two guys gonna be okay?
-Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
We're adults.
We're mature adults!
It's getting sort of hot in here, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's a bit - it's a bit hot.
You don't mind if I take off my jacket, do you?
Makes no difference to me.
Looks like we're gonna be here for a little while.
May as well try to make ourselves comfortable.
Maybe there are some chairs in here.
Ah, here we are!
I'll just have to move this down along -What's that?
-I must have knocked open a music box in here somewhere.
-I'm not really in the mood for music.
Could you stop that, please?
Yes, yes, I'll try.
God, it's hot in here!
-What's that smell?
-I seem to have broken a bottle of something Musk oil!
Oh, oh, where is that damn music box?
Here it is!
I really think that it would be a very good thing if you just did something about that musk oil Oh, I know, hand me that drop-cloth there and maybe I can just smother it.
Who lives in this building?
!
You know er, I think we can just forego the musk oil right now.
Why don't you just cover, cover that back up.
No no no no no, not gonna touch this thing again.
Look at me, I'm all dirty.
-Ooh, stop - stop - stop!
-You're right!
We have gazed into the gaping maw of temptation, and survived!
My God, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of us!
I am, too!
God!
Of course, the cable could break.
-And we'd be kicking ourselves all the way down -You are so right!
-Goodnight, Dr Crane.
-Miss Costas.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Anyway, Doc, I got this thing.
It's, uh, got to do with women.
Well, I sense you're having trouble finding Miss Right.
What, are you nuts?
I meet Miss Right most every night!
Eager young college girls, tough career women hungry for a little R-and-R, if you know what I'm saying Well, you're leaving precious little room for misinterpretation.
But I sense, despite these frequent dalliances, that you're still not truly happy.
Well, sure I am.
It's just that I lost a pinky ring in one of their houses.
Star sapphire, beautiful thing.
I figured if I went public with it on your show I had a pretty good chance of getting it back.
Well, Vinnie, it's obvious you know nothing about this show, or how to treat women.
But even more appalling, you know even less about jewelry!
A pinkie no more needs a ring than a neck needs a gold medallion!
- Just shoot me, why don't you?
- I'd be delighted!
We'll be right back after this.
Hi, Dr. Crane.
- He's driving me crazy!
- Well Roz, we can't all choose our admirers.
It's gone way beyond the admiring stage.
Have you seen this petition he's got going around?
It's to the talented producers of Star Trek suggesting a new character.
"The all-powerful space vixen Rozalinda"!
Four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak!
I'll sign that.
Well, Roz, television will never improve unless the viewers speak out!
Thanks.
I'd better go.
- Well, live long and prosper!
- Oh, just go!
I am the joke of the station.
When I used to come in the morning the guard would say,"Morning, Roz".
Now it's "All hail, Rozalinda"!
Roz, I think you should be flattered.
Noel's attempt to immortalize you is-is akin to a love poem written by Robert Browning to his wife.
Did he ever write a poem where he gave her two extra breasts?
Well, I'd have to check my English Lit notes, but I think not, no.
Hello?
Yes?
Niles, Niles, slow down, I can hardly understand you!
- What is it?
- Maris is missing!
What?
No, I don't think you should drag the koi pond!
Listen, I'll be right over!
All right, just hang tight!
- Roz, Roz, how much time left in the show?
- No, you go, do whatever you have to do.
I'll handle things here.
- You're sure you can manage?
- If I can nurse quadruplets and still find time to rule Rozniak, I can do anything!
- All right, what's going on?
- Yeah, Maris is really gone.
- I'm on the phone with the station right now.
- Apparently she just vanished.
No note, nothing.
- Oh, Frasier, thank God you're here.
- Any news, Dr. Crane?
No, no, I asked the neighbors if they'd seen any strange cars in the neighborhood.
One reported spotting something called a "minivan".
But that was weeks ago!
Well, there's no need to panic, Niles.
I'm sure she's all right.
Oh, dear me I don't want to alarm you Dr.Crane but I'm getting a very strong vibration off this.
She's waving this poker around and screaming,"You thief!
Get out!
- You'll never get away with this!
- Wait No, I remember.
That's what she said to the decorator when he tried to double-bill her for the andirons.
I was wondering why the intruder was wearing Toreador pants.
Yeah, Mike, I'm still here.
Yeah, that's right, she's been missing three days.
Uh,excuse me?
She's been missing for three days and you're just panic-stricken now?
I only just realized it.
The last two nights, I knocked on Maris's bedroom door to wish her goodnight and I was greeted with a chilly silence so, naturally I assumed everything was status quo.
Uh, thin.
Make that VERY thin.
Caucasian.
VERY Caucasian.
Oh God, what could be happening to her?
Oh, wait, wait, you got something?
O.K., uh-huh, O.K. Mike ran a check on Maris's credit cards, there's been a whole bunch of charges in New York.
Oh, God.
She's been kidnapped.
Someone's using her credit cards.
Yeah, O.K., slow down.
Armani Valentino Cartier Tiffany - Any restaurants?
- Any restaurants?
Not a one.
She's alive!
- Oh, Niles!
You're certain!
- Oh, yes!
From that list, she's recreating her infamous "Sakes alive, I'm thirty-five" shopping spree!
O.K., Mike, thanks a lot.
Yeah, I owe you.
Bye.
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so relieved.
- Oh, so am I. I'm exhausted.
I was so scared.
Frasier?
What's wrong?
You look positively uncelebratory.
Aren't you glad Maris is O.K.?
Of course I am.
It's just that well, here you are, all panic-stricken and scared to death, and she's off on some shopping trip!
Don't you find that the least bit upsetting?
Yes, I suppose her behavior was a tad inconsiderate.
- Well, she left without so much as a note or a phone call!
- Frasier, stay out of this.
It's between Niles and his wife.
You know, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is not the first time we've experienced Maris's selfish behavior!
She always puts her needs above his!
She never attends family functions!
Doesn't that make you angry?
Well, over the years I've learned to accept Maris's eccentricities.
- Oh, she's not being eccentric.
She's being arrogant and selfish!
- If he says he's not angry, he's not angry.
- And even if I were angry, what would you have me do?
- Let it out!
Well,I am letting it out!
I'm getting hives!
Well, that is a triumph of self-expression!
why don't you just let out some of the words that you're dying to say?
Oh God, I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble!
A-ha!
You're not angry at me!
That was directed at Maris!
Nope, that was for you!
This is for Maris!
Whoa!
O.K., all right, Niles, now you got it out of your system!
Yes, but it felt so good!
Let me do one more!
All right, Niles, this is good, this is healthy!
But you've got to channel it!
You must talk to Maris!
Oh no, wait!
That's beautiful!
Here, this one's hideous!
- Hey, I gave him that for a wedding present!
- Well, all right, here!
Dios Mio!
Oh, Marta!
This feels wonderful!
You must try it!
I meant at your house.
- Oh my God, it's Maris!
- Maris?
!
What?
!
- You said she was in New York!
- Well, I don't know, she probably flew back!
All right, all right, no one panic, there's an easy solution to this!
Frasier, bash me on the head with this, we'll tell Maris there was a break-in!
Niles, Niles, stop it!
- God, you are the damaged party here, not Maris!
- But-but-but-but the mess!
This mess is the physical manifestation of years of repressed anger!
It's time to draw a line in the sand and say,"I have had enough"!
My God, man, show her your mess!
You're right.
It's time I told Maris I will not tolerate this behavior.
I'm going up there and I'm going to demand an apology!
Good for you!
I always hated that dynasty.
- How're you feeling, Mr. Crane?
- I'm fine, I wish you'd quit asking me.
Well, it's a reasonable question for a man who just ate a cut of prime rib the size of a hatbox.
Well, whose fault's that?
You're the one who was too embarrassed to walk out with a doggie bag.
For what it cost, that meat was coming with me, one way or another!
Goodness, we've been gone three hours.
Probably have a dog with a full bladder in there.
Lord, let's hope so.
Hey, Daphne, how do you feel about taking him for a walk?
I just want to get in there and unbuckle my pants since I wasn't allowed to at the restaurant!
Oh, sure.
We all know how Eddie needs his exercise.
we wouldn't want all that fatty meat he eats clogging up his aging arteries until his poor old heart gives out.
Oh and, uh, why don't you pick up some half-and-half at the corner store too?
Get moving, old man!
- There y'are!
- Niles?
Sorry to startle you, I let myself in.
Want a beer?
No.
I have to thank you for putting me in touch with my anger.
I had no idea how therapeutic it was to just pick something up and smash it!
Well you're welcome, Niles.
But, um, how did things go with Maris?
I marched into her room and demanded an explanation.
It seems that over lunch with her garden club, Maris heard that the new Couture lines had arrived in New York.
So she hied her way to the airport, and in her haste she forgot to leave me a note.
- Unbelievable!
- Just thinking about it makes me furious!
- Really?
- Yes!
So I told her, Maris, you were inconsiderate, and when you are ready to apologize, I can be reached at Frasier's!
Then I stormed out and slammed the door.
Of course, it was that fourteenth-century Bavarian cathedral door, so I had to get two of the servants to help me slam it.
But what it lacked in spontaneity it made up for in resonance!
Well, Niles, you know I'm not usually one to toot my own horn, but I think in this case I was on the mark.
- You feel good, don't you?
- I feel great!
- You feel empowered?
- So empowered!
- And you'd like to switch to wine now, wouldn't you?
- Oh, please.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Maris.
Yes, Niles is here.
Hello, Maris.
Mmm-Hmm.
Well, I know you're not used to me speaking to you that way.
That's rather the point, wouldn't you agree?
Uh-huh.
I see.
Well, thank you.
I know this was a very difficult call for you to make.
Goodbye.
- It's no use.
She still won't talk to me.
- Oh, just give her time to cool off.
Call her again in the morning.
Geez, you must be exhausted, Niles.
Why don't you call it a day and get some rest,huh?
- Do you have a blanket for me?
- Oh now, Niles, you've been going through a rough time lately, you're not sleeping on any couch.
You can sleep in Frasier's bed.
- What?
- You're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
No trouble.
I wouldn't want to impose.
No, don't worry about it, you're family.
Thank you.
Well, that was very generous of you.
- Well, it's the least you can do after getting him kicked out of the house.
- Well, Dad, I was just trying to do what's right for him.
Well, trust me.
I handled domestic disputes for thirty years.
The first rule is, don't take sides.
- Well, it's just a little difficult when it happens to be your own brother.
- Well, that's the second rule.
When it's your own family, keep your nose out of their personal problems.
- This is starting to make some sense.
- Well, maybe you should listen to your old man once in a while.
- I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, I'm just a cop.
- But a darn good one.
- You're going to talk to Maris, aren't you?
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Don't ignore me, Marta!
- Go away!
Let me in, I need to speak with Mrs. Crane!
Missy Crane say, no you Dr. Crane, no other Dr. Crane, and no Crane with a cane!
- Well, at least tell her that I'm here!
- She know.
Everybody know.
Maris?
Maris, we need to talk!
Oh, look, look, I know you're up there, I can see you through the shutters!
All right, if you won't talk, listen!
Niles didn't ask me to come here, I came because I care about both of you.
I realize that Niles spoke to you rather harshly today.
Truth be told, is it was I that urged him to express his anger.
As hard as it was for you to listen to such criticism, you're a fair-minded woman and you must concede that he had a right to be upset!
Oh!
Oh, Maris!
By opening that window you're opening up a window to a long and happy marriage, that's good!
All right, you're expressing your anger!
That's good, too!
But, listen, in spite of that last little outburst,I am not going to leave here until we've had some sort of a breakthrough!
Well, I see our time is up, I'll let myself out!
I know you're there.
After last night, frankly, I've had quite enough of your kind.
You can stare all you like.
I'm not going to give you anything to eat.
Oh, all right, here.
You might as well finish off this god-awful Shepherd's Pie that Daphne made.
Lord knows it isn't fit for humans.
Did that sound like "humans"?
I said "Mormons".
- You're not at your quickest first thing in the morning, are you?
- Well, it was a rough night.
Well, maybe next time you'll listen to your old man and not come between a husband and his wife.
And here's Dad, all sleep-refreshed and bright-eyed, ready to resume his lecture!
Oh look, your brother left us a note.
Dear Dad, Frasier, & Daphne: when you wake up this morning I'll be gone.
Thank you for all your help, but I don't want to be a burden any longer.
You don't think no, I'm sure this is all completely harmless.
Yeah, my gun's still locked upand the door to the balcony's closed And we all know that Daphne's Shepherd's Pie is still in the refrigerator.
Hi-ho, everyone!
What are you all doing inside on such a beautiful, clear autumn day?
Niles, you seem awfully chipper this morning.
Well, I woke up this morning and I had a realization.
Like it or not, my life is changing.
I'm single now, so I went out and rented a bachelor pad.
Ooh, is that coffee?
- Don't you think that's jumping the gun a little bit?
- Oh no, Dad.
Maris, uh, ordered me to get my stuff out of there by sundown, or else she'd turn it over to a church bazaar.
Oh, and I got these jeans!
Right?
Right?
And I'm starting a goatee, and I'm thinking of joining a gym, but I don't know whether aerobics or weight training is the quickest route to "buff"!
Any thoughts?
One thought: seek help!
Niles, you've just been through a very traumatic experience here and you are deep in denial here.
You are going through some very extreme emotions right now, and rather than feeling them, you're denying they even exist.
I'm not denying my feelings.
I'm so in tune with my emotions that I was able to move through them quickly.
In fact, I've logged them all in my journal.
Let's see, where are we?
Here5  Blissful confusion.
Something's happened, but what?
oh, right!
Wept uncontrollably.
Ate entire box of Frosted Flakes, they're gr-r-r-reat!
So don't you tell me I'm not in touch with my emotions!
It's not easy for me to say goodbye, especially after so many years all we've shared, all that we've meant to one another.
Jean-Pierre, Marie, Bernard, thank you for your years of devoted service.
As a personal favor, please look after Mrs. Crane.
It'll be just you and her from now on.
Uh, the staff, they have a question: Can we come with you?
Marta, I'm afraid this is a road I must walk alone.
- Must be very painful, isn't it?
- Painful doesn't begin to describe it.
But they're strong, they'll get over it.
Oh, watch that, careful with those!
Look at him, Dad.
My God, he's locked in denial!
Oh, for God's sake.
First you get him to move out, then when he does he's not upset enough for you.
There's no pleasing you!
Well, what would please me would be to see him actually experience some real emotion!
My God, he's walking through this thing like a zombie!
Well, that's everything.
Shall we?
- You know, there's no hurry, Niles.
- Well, actually there is.
I have aerobics at five, and then I'm meeting with my decorator at six-thirty.
Off we go!
Have I got my wallet?
Yes.
Have I got my checkbook?
Yes.
Have I lost my MIND?
!
I can't leave!
This is my home!
You're not taking me!
- Niles, Niles, open the door!
- Nope, nope, bye-bye!
Thanks for coming, I'll tell Maris you sent your best!
- Now, Niles, calm down.
- No, no, don't calm down!
Let it out!
This is very healing!
- Don't you ever let up?
- Look, everything's gonna be fine.
No, it isn't.
There's no life for me out there!
You're just excited.
I don't want to be a bachelor.
I didn't like it the first time.
- Niles, look, just sit down for a second, O.K.?
- Where, Frasier?
Here, in the chair that Maris and I picked out on our honeymoon in Vienna?
Or here, where I sit Sunday mornings playing Mahler while Maris dabs at her watercolors?
Perhaps here, where we sipped champagne on our last anniversary.
Guess that really was our last anniversary.
- Oh, Niles - Dr. Crane?
- Yes, Marta?
- Missy Crane give me message for you: if you say is all your fault, you no have to leave.
- I can stay?
- She waiting upstairs.
Niles, before you make your decision, just make sure that you're remembering things the way they really were.
Yes, you bought that chair on your honeymoon in Vienna.
But remember, you wanted to buy the chair that you saw in Paris.
Yes, you sit at the piano every Sunday morning and play Mahler for Maris.
But you hate Mahler!
Besides Maris, who doesn't?
!
Look, just give him a little air here Look, all I'm saying is that along with the good things in your marriage, there were problems things you said you couldn't live with anymore.
Now if you want those to change, you have got to stand up to her.
If you back down now, you will go through the rest of your life feeling weak and small because you never had the courage to say:I will not let you treat me like this, Lilith!
Maris!
Well, I've lost all credibility here.
Dad, would you please say something?
- I wouldn't mind knowing what you think.
- It doesn't matter what I think..
What matters is what you think.
Now if you want to walk up those stairs, we'll support you.
If you want to go out that door, we'll support you there, too.
What are you, nuts?
!
You're gonna go up there and grovel to that woman after what she did to you?
!
Actually, I was just going to get my car keys.
But thanks for the impartial advice, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ah, Niles.
Hello.
Is it just me, or are the sidewalk Santas getting pushy?
Well, tomorrow is Christmas.
I suppose they might be expecting a little downturn after that.
Cappuccino, please.
So?
When does Frederick arrive?
In six hours and twenty-one minutes.
Not that I'm the least bit excited.
Yes, I'm sure he's excited too.
First Christmas at daddy's.
I imagine he has visions of sugarplums dancing through his head.
No, Lilith doesn't allow sweets, he's probably got visions of bran.
Well, I've got my own reasons to celebrate.
Maris and I may be together again, by the new year.
Oh, really Niles?
Yep, yeah.
I called this morning to arrange the delivery of her Christmas gift, and she said the only gift she'd accept from me was an abject apology.
Going to cave into her, aren't you?
Au contraire.
I told her I was not about to apologise, and from that point on, the respect in her voice came through loud and clear.
No small feat, considering at the time she was speaking at the time through the hole in her massage table.
Oh, hi Roz.
Hey.
Double espresso, please.
This last-minute Christmas shopping is killing me.
I never know what to give the men in my life.
Since when?
Ha, ha.
Funny man.
Excuse me, I'll take care of this.
Oh, thank you Niles.
What's new, Niles?
I have been keeping it under wraps but, Maris and I have separated.
Oh, my God!
I had no idea.
I can't believe no-one told me.
This is such a surprise!
That's enough, Talulah.
You're not fooling anyone.
I'm sorry sir, your card didn't clear.
I have to do this.
Wait, wait!
What are you doing?
The computer said "credit cancelled by order of co-signatory".
Maris has cancelled your credit card.
Whoa, Merry Christmas!
Would you care to use a different one?
There's no point, they're all in her name.
I'm calling her right now and demanding the restoration of my credit card.
And my bank accounts.
And my phone service!
Doc, I'm at the airport, and I'm having a lot of trouble getting on the plane.
Now Bob, statistics prove that we're safer in the air than on the ground.
That-that's not it.
I'm supposed to be flying home to Newark for Christmas, but the flight the next gate over has a flight to Maui.
I'm telling you, it's calling me, Doc.
Why are you hesitant to go home?
Because it's the same thing every year.
I travel three thousand miles to sit down at the dinner table with my family, and what do we talk about?
What's going on in out lives?
No.
Our hopes and dreams?
No.
We talk about the turkey.
"Boy, that's quite a bird".
"Twenty-four pounder".
"What time did you have to get up to put that in the oven, Ange"?
"Oh boy, that's moist.
You must have been basting that bird all day".
"Are those walnuts in the stuffing"?
"Oh god, I forgot to put the rolls in the oven".
I guess what I'm trying to say, Bob, is that we're all in the same gravy boat.
But you see, the important thing is that we spend time with our loved ones.
Just think how you'd feel if you woke up tomorrow morning six thousand miles away from your home.
Well, I tell ya, that really puts it in perspective, doc.
I got a plane to catch.
Mele Keleke Maka, Bob.
We'll be right back after these messages.
Oh, Roz.
What did they say, what did they say?
Oh, relax.
Frederick's flight is still on time, he'll be here in less than three hours.
Oh, and the florist called, you can pick up your wreath on the way home.
Oh, fabulous.
You know, every year Dad puts that kitschy creature with the lightbulb nose on the door.
Hey, great party.
Best one ever, thanks to me.
I hired a stripper!
Doc, you will never guess what her name is Candy Kane.
What are the odds?
For those of you who have not yet sampled the punch, here is my capsule review: vile bouquet, unwholesome colour, ghastly taste - and a kick that is simply heaven.
OK, 30 seconds, Out!
All right people, out, out, please.
Hey, Roz.
You know what's over my head?
Almost any clever remark?
What's she mean by that?
Oh, listen Roz.
I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad, so in the spirit of the Christmas season, why don't you just take off early, hmm?
You're going to read one of your inspirational Christmas fables again, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat.
Right.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Roz.
Say "Hi" to Frederick.
Yes, and say "Hi" to your mom for me.
Will do.
Hi, we're back.
As most of my faithful listeners know, every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season.
So without any further ado, I give you "The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd".
"Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd.
He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute".
"A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings.
And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound" This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me!
"One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music, and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute".
"So one dark- night, one dark- -windy night" "The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home, he couldn't make it play.
So he smashed the flute to bits".
"When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken" YIKES!
"He might have said that" "But instead he forgave the merchant's son.
And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and" OH, MAMA!
"?
he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife "And somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas".
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday.
There now, you see?
Nice try.
Miss Kane's delightful performance aside, this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed.
Oh for God's sakes, what am I, a robot?
And to all a good night.
IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN Hi, Dad.
Ah, I'm going to put this wreath up here.
What's the matter with Rudolph?
Well Dad, you know, I just think that Christmas decorations should be understated and tasteful.
Boy, I can't get one thing that I want.
Dad, I'm sorry, but if I gave you one thing, God knows where it might lead.
Oh, God it's my childhood Christmases all over again.
Only now Mom isn't here to say, "Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings".
Oh, don't be such a Grinch.
Ho, Ho, Ho!
It works when you step on the mat.
Ho, Ho, Ho!
It can say "Ho, Ho, Ho", "Merry Christmas", or "Happy Holidays".
Yeah, well I hope it can say "Geronimo" because I'm going to throw him off the balcony!
Well, I don't care what you think, it's not for you, it's for Frederick.
God, I suppose you're right, Dad.
I used to love this stuff when I was six.
By the time I was seven I started to have questions.
When I was eight I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins.
Well, I'm off to Joe's parents' house.
I see you've been busy in the kitchen.
Yes.
I'm bringing Grammy Moon's famous plum duff.
It's a still flour pudding boiled in a cloth bag.
Who gets to lick the bag?
No.
You see, Grammy Moon had a secret ingredient.
She'd soak it for hours in rum, then ignite it in a blinding flash.
As soon as she came out of the kitchen with no eyebrows, we knew dessert was ready You know, to this day the smell of burning hair puts me in the holiday spirit.
Bye, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
You know, someone's got to go back down to the storeroom, there's still something missing.
You must be kidding, Dad.
My God, this place couldn't look any more ludicrous.
Once I saw how those white hairs on his chin looked like a beard, the rest of the idea just fell into place.
Niles.
Hello, Frasier I know, I know - "Shut up, we'll hurt his feelings".
So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris?
No, but!
- I had an epiphany.
I realised, cutting off my funds is Maris's way of saying, "I love you"!
She always uses money to get what she wants; ergo, this is proof she wants me back!
What do you think?
Ho, Ho, Ho!
I think Santa's said it all for us.
Dad, you have to get out more.
You've started doing old lady things.
It's for Frederick!
Oh, of course it is.
Oh, that reminds me, I don't want to impose, but may I ride with you to the airport to pick up Frederick?
Of course you may, Niles.
Just have to wrap up his presents first.
So what did you get Freddie?
Well actually dad, I ordered him the toy catalogue, from the special section called "Gifts for the Gifted".
I got him the junior astronomy set, and the geology lab oh, and a fabulous thing called the "Living Brain".
You get to paint each lobe a different colour, then you stuff it inside the Living Skull.
Hey, you know what kids really like?
They've been advertising it like crazy on TV.
It's great.
The Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.
Its head lights up and it shoots death rays out of its eyes.
Yeah.
A little like that.
Listen Dad, I think I know what Frederick likes.
He's precocious, he needs to be challenged.
Oh, challenge him the other 364 days.
One day out of the year, indulge him.
Let him be a kid.
Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies!
This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport God, you realise what this means?
!
Yes.
The Cranes of Maine have got your "Living Brain".
No.
It means I don't have anything for Freddie.
God, I wanted everything to be so perfect.
Now he's going to have a horrible Christmas.
listen, it's OK.
There's a big toy store in the mall.
They're open late tonight.
Just don't worry about it.
Well, that's easy for you to say, Dad.
My God, it's Christmas Eve, the gifts I ordered are three thousand miles away, my son is due in an hour, and on top of it all I have to go to a mall!
Ho, Ho, Ho!
Oh, don't look at me, he said it.
A MALL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS Niles, customers are marauding through here like a pack of feral dogs.
Did you see that woman?
She practically knocked me over on her way to the escalator.
Well, how about that woman near the cosmetics counter who tried to mace me?
That was a cologne sample, Niles.
That's what they do.
Now listen, we've got five minutes.
We've got to find a sales clerk.
Oh well, good luck.
All right, we'd better find something ourselves, I guess.
Well hey, hey.
This looks amusing.
Niles, may I remind you we're looking for something educational?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it has buttons.
What's it doing?
It's flashing.
Niles, please remember that Freddie tested in the highest percentile for cognitive skills and deductive reasoning.
What's it doing now?
It's beeping, for God's sake!
And as much as I'd like to inflict this on Lilith, I'm looking for fast and educational, all right?
I wonder what else it does?
Let's see if it protects your head!
Ooh, here's something.
Look at this, look at this.
Oh, God.
It's called "Ecto Goo".
Oh well, that sounds vaguely scientific but what could he possibly learn from that?
Well, for starters, he can learn never to wear Armani to a toy store.
Let's see, I'll just have to remember what I ordered from the catalogue and look for that.
First, the "Living Brain".
Living Brain?
What kind of dork wants that?
With any luck, the kind of dork who'll be operating on your prostate someday.
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.
Look, look, look, there it is.
It's up on the shelf, it's up on the shelf.
Oh, marvelous.
Oh, Lord.
It's covered with dust.
The brain is dusty.
Could there be a clearer metaphor?
Oh, Lord.
There's nothing in it.
Can I have it?
It's an empty box, Ma'am.
I know, but I can put my son's Robo Geek in it.
You know how scared he'll be when he thinks he's getting something this nerdy?
Oh God, this is hopeless.
We'll never find anything for Frederick.
Oh, Frasier.
Just give him a cheque.
But Niles, you can't give a cheque to a child.
That's what I'm giving him.
It has a stagecoach on it.
Niles, Maris cancelled your account.
Damn!
Oh, look.
Look at that man's bag.
"Young Minds".
Sir, excuse me, is this store in the mall?
Yeah.
And it's educational toys?
Mmm-hmm, nothing but.
It's just a couple of doors down.
Yes!
Petunia, there is a Santa Claus.
No, they closed a half hour ago.
Damn.
Look, this is perfect, look a chemistry lab, and a picture puzzle and You know, my son comes in, in half an hour and I've absolutely nothing for him.
He'll be in, in 22 minutes if he picks up a good tailwind.
You ahh, you really need this stuff bad, don't you?
Oh, you have no idea, it would save my life.
I'll tell you what.
Seeing as how it's Christmas Oh, God bless you, sir.
A thousand bucks.
What?
!
A thousand bucks?
Hey, take it or leave it.
Well, I mean, there's just no more than a hundred dollars worth of things here.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our descent into Seattle airport".
I'm just trying to do you a favour here.
Well, it's some favour.
"Please make sure your tables and seats are in their full and upright position".
Shut up, Niles!
All right, all right, lets see what I've got here.
All right, I've got, ahh Here's three hundred dollars.
Would you-would you accept a personal cheque for the rest?
Hey, it's Christmas.
Oh, bless you, bless you so much.
Very well, thank you.
Niles, give the man a cheque.
Where's Freddie?
Putting on his pajamas.
Told me he would come in and say goodnight after he brushes his teeth.
So how'd you do?
Well, I didn't get exactly what I'd ordered, but I think I did all right.
I got him a microscope, a chemistry set, and a five thousand piece puzzle of the Great Wall of China.
Well, maybe he'll have fun with the boxes.
Dad, here you go, this is the last box from the storeroom.
Now, was this what you were looking for?
Oh, yeah.
Santa's legs for the chimney, you remember these babies?
Oh, yes.
Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed.
Frasier, isn't this the smoking jacket you gave Dad a few years back?
What?
Hey How did that get in there?
Dad, these are all of the gifts I've given you for the last six years.
Hey, c'mon now, shut the- put 'em back.
Close the box, will ya?
Dad, look at this.
My God, they're still in the original boxes, never been worn.
Sure they have.
Oh, yeah.
This one still has the tags on it.
Look, this isn't the kind of conversation we should be having on Christmas eve.
No, Dad?
Well, what was it you wanted to say?
Well, you know Frasier, you're always giving people things you think they should like, instead of things that they really like.
I mean, come on - In your entire life, have you ever seen me wear anything like that?
Well, no.
I thought you might like a change.
Well, it's like when you were a kid, remember?
I wanted you to love baseball.
I wanted to get you a bat, glove, everything, for Christmas.
But you had your mind set on a microscope, so that's what I got you.
And then when Dad took us to a game, you spent the whole time looking for rodent hairs in your hot-dog.
I'm just saying Christmas isn't the time you try to mold somebody, which is what you're trying to do with Frederick.
I think I know what's good for my own son.
I brushed my teeth, Daddy.
Oh, that's my boy.
Come on.
Bonsoir, Uncle Niles.
Et toi aussi.
Hey, you'd better get to sleep, or Santa won't come.
OK.
I know just what Santa's bringing me this year, Dad.
I bet you don't.
Yes I do too.
It's an Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.
What makes you think that?
Because I asked Santa for it in my letter.
They are sooo cool.
Ahh, listen ahh, Frederick, there's erm Frederick, where are you going?
I'm going to make myself fall asleep right away, so the next thing I know, it'll be morning.
Goodnight, Daddy.
I'll come in and tuck you in, in a minute.
Goodnight, Grandpa.
Goodnight, Uncle Niles.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Frederick.
I'm going to go home and go to bed too.
I hope Aunt Maris comes out of her coma.
He asked where she was, I thought the truth would just upset him.
I'll see you in the morning.
Merry Christmas.
See you tomorrow.
Well, this is turning out to be quite a Christmas.
Oh, it's going to be fine.
Done it again.
Gotten everyone the wrong gifts.
What is it about me?
Well, here, you might as well open your gift now.
No reason for everyone to be disappointed tomorrow.
Hey, I'm sure I'm gonna love it.
I doubt it.
Not exactly my night.
Hey!
A robe!
Great, I love it!
No, you don't.
It's not a robe, it's a dressing gown.
Noel Coward would love it, but it's not you.
Hey, I love Noel Coward!
Dad, you're overcompensating.
Some people are hard to buy for, I'm sorry.
But, you know, you are too, I never know what to get you.
Here.
You might as well open this now.
Yeah.
Guess it was easier when I was small.
'Cause kids always know what they want, don't they?
Yeah, yeah.
It's rough for adults.
Oh, Dad Merry Christmas, son.
How did you know?
It's jut what I always wanted: My very own Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.
Oh, Dad - oh, oh, listen, are the batteries included?
In the box.
Oh, Dad!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
We'll be right back after this.
OK, after this spot we're gonna come back in 15 seconds, you do a station ID and then toss it to the news.
I'll count you down.
That won't be necessary.
I have a built in mental stopwatch.
As a child playing "Hide and Go Seek" I was the only one who didn't need to say, "One Hippopotamus Two Hippopotamus".
Frasier, I've heard you.
You're always either talking into the news or running short.
I am not!
I'll bet you 20 bucks you blow this one.
All right, you're on.
No, you are.
Hello, we're back.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane tuning in for our second hour on the "Dr. Frasier Crane Show".
In our first hour we covered everything from anorexia to xenophobia.
What will be next?
As always of course that's entirely up to you.
So stick around ?
the Doctor is in and he's listening.
Ooh, this is KACL 780 AM This is nbc news..
That was very smooth.
Thank you.
Oh, let's see.
ÂOne Andrew Jackson, Two Andrew Jackson?
Look Frasier, I've been getting a lot of complaints from sponsors saying that their ads are getting buried in huge commercial blocks.
I see.
So instead of having four blocks per hour we're going to have eight only they're only going to be half as long.
I thought it might help you.
And you want to stay on top, don't you, Frasier?
Frasier?
Of course, very much so, yes!
Good.
Frasier, what was that?
What was what?
Call me crazy, but when you were talking to Kate you had this goofy little teenage look on your face.
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you got a thing for her.
For Kate?
mm-hmm.
Look at you.
You're flushed.
I had Mexican for lunch.
It's not lust ?
it's a Chimichanga.
Frasier, I'm sorry but I'm never wrong about these things.
Have you lost your mind?
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
Roz, you're wrong.
Oh my God.
I'm sitting on a powder-keg here.
You've got a crush on Kate!
Stop it.
Everybody knows you are the biggest gossip in the entire station.
You'll be sworn to secrecy.
I swear I won't tell anyone.
No, it doesn't count until you shake my hand.
Oh, all right.
Roz, Kate and I Oh my God!
Kate's "Dirty Girl"!
Kate is the woman you had sex with on the air in this booth and you were calling "Dirty Girl"?
Oh my God!
I just need a minute here Alright.
Of course it happened months ago.
Only a couple of times.
Roz: Uh-huh.
Our relationship started out so antagonistic.
Then suddenly it just spilled over into passion.
Intense, romantic, exciting the whole thing's over now, but Roz, you will say nothing, absolutely nothing Roz?
Roz?
Boy, I'll never do that again!
I notice you're grating that carrot at a 45-degree angle.
Does that enhance the flavour?
No, no.
Just an old habit.
And why exactly did you choose to grate carrots?
Because we have carrots!
I hope you don't mind all the questions.
It's just now that I'm separated I'm going to have to learn to cook for myself.
Quite alright.
Tell you what.
Why don't you grate while I put the chicken in?
Thousands of little metal teeth able to tear the flesh right off your No, no, false alarm.
Normally I bleed like the Russian royal Family, but not today.
That's Interesting.
You put a toothpick in that chicken.
Now, is that to check when it's done?
No, no.
I'm just marking which one is yours.
Dr. Crane, would you mind setting the table?
Oh, certainly.
Just give a yell if there's anything else that you need to have grated.
You've done enough grating for one night!
Writing a letter?
No, I'm writing my memoirs!
I'll take that as a Yes.
My old army buddy.
You know that's the improper use of a hyphen.
Somehow I don't think Maurie Dingman will mind.
Then I'm sure he won't notice that missing comma and that run-on sentence.
Although this is a particularly glaring error.
It's best not to end a sentence with a preposition.
Not to be technical, but "Off" is a preposition too!
Evening all.
Good news.
I have tickets for the symphony tomorrow night.
Are you free?
Well, actually no.
I have a date.
With who?
Some woman I met at my accountant's.
Yeah, when I was in the service ?
first thing I'd do when I hit a new port was go straight to an accountant and find out where the action was.
I must admit I'm having a little trouble working up my enthusiasm about it.
Only the woman's fault.
It's just that I find myself preoccupied with somebody else right now.
Well, frankly, it's gone a bit beyond preoccupation.
I'm having fantasies about her all the time.
Well there's nothing wrong with that.
You know, when I first met your mother she was so upbeat and bouncy I used to fantasize about her wearing a skimpy little cheerleader's outfit, shaking her pom-poms Grow up you two!
I'm just saying it's perfectly natural.
I can't tell you the number of times I was on a stake-out in the cold picturing your mother in front of a warm fire wearing nothing but a Frasier/Niles: DAD!
!
!
Oh, I'm sorry.
One day your mother and I went on a church picnic and the two of you came floating down the river in little wicker baskets!
Was that so hard?
You know, I'm beginning to wonder if I have real feelings for this woman?
I mean I think about her all the time.
Ooh this sounds interesting.
Who are we talking about?
Kate from the office.
Oh, "Dirty Girl".
She seemed nice.
She is nice.
Intelligent, accomplished.
Well, if you think so much of her why don't you ask her out?
Well, we agreed we wouldn't pursue things.
Frankly, she hasn't given me any indication since that she's even had a second thought about me.
Added to which, if Frasier did pursue her and she rejected him, he could hardly rationalise it by saying she doesn't know what she's missing.
She would know exactly what she's missing - she just didn't miss it!
Thank you, Niles!
You can't let fear of rejection stop you Dr. Crane.
Well, you know Daphne, it's just not that easy really.
Maybe I'm letting this romantic fantasy run away with me.
Truth is we don't really know each other very well and, you know what if she did reject me, I'd end up going to work every day feeling like a fool.
Hey, am I getting a whiff of chicken here?
Oh fine Dad!
Frankly I've had enough of you and your adolescent wisecracks.
I am not "chicken".
I am just merely hesitant.
alright!
I will ask her out tomorrow.
Fine.
I hope that makes you happy!
I just thought I smelled dinner!
THE CITY WITH BROAD, BARE SHOULDERS Oh Kate.
Hi.
There you are.
I wanted to talk with you.
I'm just going down to the Billing department.
I'll ride along with you.
You know, it seems every time we speak lately the conversation always leads to ratings, commercials, demographics hirings and firings, promotions, demotions, the odd skirmish over the expense account.
It just seems all so dry and impersonal.
Did I hit the right button?
Oh, yes!
Yes.
Yeah.
You did.
You did.
You hit the right button.
I'm sorry ?
I've got a lot on my mind.
Yeah, so do I. Kate I wanted to ask you?
Frasier, I'm leaving KACL.
I'm moving to Chicago.
What?
Yeah.
I'm taking over a station there.
In fact I'm going out on the "Redeye" tonight.
I thought, given our history, I should tell you first.
Well, I'm at a loss for words.
Wouldn't you know it ?
on the day I'm leaving?
Well congratulations.
This is a big step for you.
Thanks.
Boy, this was not an easy decision believe me.
You never know if you're leaving a place too soon.
All I know is that for the time you've been here I've certainly enjoyed having you.
Having you I know.
I guess this is goodbye.
I suppose so.
Goodbye, Kate.
My.
Don't you look dashing?
Thank you.
So, tell me about this woman you're going out with.
Well, her name's Donna.
She's an art director.
Or a park director ?
I forget.
Look, I know you're upset about Kate leaving but cheer up.
There's nothing quite as exciting as a first date.
All those questions you ask.
"What's your favourite food"?
"What's your favourite colour"?
"If you were to come back as an animal, what sort of animal would you be"?
If she were to ask you that one, what would you say?
"Cheque please" comes to mind!
Hello?
Niles, no one was mean to you last night.
No, if you want to come over, that's great.
Yeah, we'd love to see you.
OK.
Bye.
Hey Niles.
No traffic?
Dad, you sounded lonely so I rented some movies.
Oh, didn't you know the VCR is broken?
Oh, that's right, I got it fixed.
What'd you bring?
I have "The Way We Were" and a classic, "Casablanca".
Oh, I just love that movie.
Is there any more heartbreaking moment in all of film than when Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman to get on that plane with Victor Laszlow even though Bogey loves her?
What an ending!
Well, there goes my need to finally see that one.
He cares deeply for her and yet he lets her go.
Wonder why Bogey did that?
Why don't we put the movie in and find out?
Because Laszlow needed her by his side to fight the Nazis.
Forget the Nazis.
No man in his right mind would give up Ingrid Bergman.
Oh sure!
Sacrifice the entire free world for a little Swedish meatball?
Look, I don't like Nazis any more than the next guy but what's Ingrid going to do with Laszlow?
You're missing the point.
What makes the movie so romantic is seeing Bogey go from a cynical playboy to a noble self-sacrificing patriot.
Oh why don't you just put on some trenchcoats and act it out?
I'm telling you, if you're in his shoes you've only got one choice.
I'll say you do.
You get the hell down to the airport and tell her to get off the plane.
She's going to Lisbon to fight the Nazis!
No, she's not.
She's going to Chicago to turn a Country & Western station into an all-talk format.
Where are you going?
To stop Kate from getting on that plane!
Well your date's gonna be here in a minute.
What are we supposed to tell her?
Oh, I don't know.
Tell her I'm visiting a sick friend or something.
Better yet ?
just tell her the truth.
Sometimes two people just aren't meant to be together.
Ooh ?
it's just like Redford and Streisand at the end of "The Way We Were".
And that's another one down.
Frasier!
Don't say anything.
Just listen.
Kate, this afternoon I wanted to say something to you but when I found out you were leaving I held back.
Well, I'm not holding back any more.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Not just about the times we made love but about the possibility that we might have a future together.
Now if there's any part of you that wonders the same thing about me, we owe it to ourselves to see it through.
You see, if you get on that plane tonight you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of our lives.
Anyway I think I made my point.
What do you think?
Kate!
More importantly, what do you think?
Aw, for God's sake, you've been bawling the whole movie.
I have not ?
my eyes just itch!
Well, it turns out Bogey was right to let her go.
Frasier, what are you doing here?
Look, Donna stayed to watch ÂCasablanca?
with us.
Donna, hi.
Hello, Frasier.
How's your friend?
In the hospital?
Oh, he's doing much better actually.
They're thinking of sending him home tomorrow.
After a heart transplant?
Well, he's with an HMO!
So er what do you say we have that dinner?
Great, I'll just grab my coat.
Kate!
OK; now you listen to me.
I was so touched by what you just said at my apartment.
You said everything that I've wanted to say to you for the last two months.
Tony's just a guy that I went out with a couple of times.
He just came over to say goodbye to me before I went to the airport.
When you saw him you just looked so hurt You had a date with her tonight too?
but apparently you rebounded!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were sincere.
Hold the elevator!
Kate!
I was, Kate!
This woman means nothing to me.
Thanks a lot!
Oh, I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm truly sorry.
It was very inconsiderate, but that woman means a great deal to me.
I'm sure you'll hate me, but I just gotta do what I gotta do.
I'm really sorry about this.
Why don't you stay and watch the end of the movie.
Thank you, but I've spent quite enough time in this house tonight.
this is lucky.
We can ride down together.
IT'S HARD TO SAY GOODBYE IF YOU WON'T LEAVE Kate!
Frasier!
Oh my God.
I know you're upset.
I don't even care about that woman.
She's just a blind date I didn't even want to go on.
I wanted to be with you tonight.
I know.
I overreacted.
I've been standing here for a half an hour hoping you'd come.
I never thought you'd come.
I can't believe I waited so long when all I had to do was say something.
Listen, it's not your fault.
I could have said something.
Well it doesn't matter.
We're together now.
Your boarding pass, please?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Couldn't you just stay one more night?
Just call them.
Tell them you'll come in tomorrow.
I can't.
I can't.
I have a board meeting in the morning.
Oh damn.
All right I'll call you.
Where are you staying?
I'm staying at The Drake.
But, you know what?
I'll call you.
I'll call you the minute I get in.
Ma'am, we're closing the doors.
Goodbye I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I just spoke with our captain and we're having a little technical snag.
So Flight 487 to Chicago will be delayed indefinitely.
I missed you!
I missed you too!
The minute that door closed I started praying for something bad to happen to your plane.
It's just like fate ?
like somebody's willing us to get together.
I felt that way since the moment I met you.
Me too.
Why don't you come with me tonight?
I gotta work.
I could come out next weekend.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, great.
You know what, you can meet my twin sister.
She lives in Chicago.
You've got a twin?
Yes.
Wow.
You know there's so much we don't know about each other.
Well, ask me.
Ask me anything.
Er oh, I know.
What's your favourite colour?
Blue.
What's yours?
Arctic silver.
It's available on all the big BMW's.
Where's your favorite city?
Paris!
Museum?
The Prada!
Musical?
Candide!
Yours?
Cats!
Really?
Well I love cats.
I have a cat.
Would you like to meet Louie?
No, no.
Allergies.
Allergies.
Not really much of a pet person.
Oh, really?
Oh, no.
All right, we'll work around that.
You Know, what we can do when you come out?
We can go jogging around the lake.
Oh Frasier, the lake is so beautiful.
Do you ever jog?
Once.
In a dark parking lot.
When a truck backfired.
Oh, all right.
We can do something that you like.
What do you like?
What do you like?
Well, we could go antiquing.
You know what?
I'm not one of those people for whom "antique" is a verb.
Ah!
Well, this is all good.
The contrasts between us will make our relationship more vibrant.
Vive la difference!
Louie's getting to you, isn't he?
No, no.
It's all right.
Well, you know, if this is really gonna be a problem there's a shot.
Yes ?
and I understand they're completely humane!
Oh, you meant an allergy shot, didn't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Frasier.
I'm just afraid that if I move Louie any further away they're gonna think he's a bomb!
It's all right.
It's all right.
So er you were saying that you love animals?
Oh yeah.
I think that's one of the main things that motivates me to work so hard.
I've always had this dream to get a ranch in Montana ?
you know?
To ski in the morning and ride horses in the afternoon?
I just always wanted to raise horses.
Wow, life on a ranch raising horses.
I always pictured myself in a penthouse raising children.
You still want more children then?
Yes.
You like kids?
Oh yeah.
I love kids.
I don't see myself mothering one, though.
You know, just to be on the safe side let me just check to see if there's another flight?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt.
Excuse me ?
is there another flight to Chicago tonight?
Not until morning.
How about on another airline?
American has one connecting through Atlanta leaving in 10 minutes.
Atlanta's good.
That's a hub.
Yeah, but they're way on the other side of the airport!
Oh damn.
I'll never get there.
Look Kate ?
fate to the rescue once again.
Sir ?
this woman has to get across the terminal post-haste.
Hey pal, this'll go a lot faster with just one person.
Good point.
Bye.
Pity, though!
Isn't it?
Well, Louie.
This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Slow down!
Hey Daphne, guess what Eddie ate in the park today?
Ooh let's see.
A hot dog wrapper?
No.
Guess again.
A cigarette butt?
No.
Guess again.
Apple core?
No.
Guess again.
Oh really, must you two play this ridiculous game?
She makes some feeble stab and you say "No.
Guess again".
Then she starts flailing away with even more ludicrous answers, all the while you chanting "Guess again", until she's gibbering like some auctioneer with a bad bladder.
Then you finally reveal the answer at which point nobody even cares.
I'm not sure which one of us got the worst of that, but I think it was you.
Guess again.
Niles.
There's a half-eaten lizard in your elevator!
And that's the last hint you're getting.
Oh Frasier, I had a breakthrough today with one of my compulsive gamblers and he gave me two tickets to the racetrack on Saturday.
It's a luxury box ?
I though you might want to go.
Oh I would love to Niles.
Why don't you want to use them?
Well, the jockeys if you must know.
What?
Diminutive, underweight figures in expensive silks wielding riding crops.
It just reminded me too much of Maris.
Dad, what about you?
I've never known you to turn down the horses.
Ah, sorry.
I've got poker with the guys.
Oh well then.
I'll just call one of my friends.
Jeez.
This is sort of embarrassing.
The first three names on my list are all back in Boston.
What about someone from your wine club?
Oh well truth be told Daphne, those people are insufferable bores unless they have a glass in their hands.
Sherry, Niles?
Please.
Oh I know.
How about Ed O'Hanlon?
Moved away last year.
Ooh, how about Edmund Kelly?
If I know old Ed he'd never leave Seattle.
Indeed not.
They buried him here three years ago.
Dear me.
Really?
I'll miss him.
Yes.
Three years from now when you think of him again there'll be a void!
My God how did this happen?
I've been back here for two years and I've yet to forge any new friendships.
You'd better watch it Frasier.
Next thing you know you're gonna be like one of these old people who are so set in their ways that they're only happy hanging around with people who are the same as they are.
What exactly is your point Dad?
That I've lost my knack for making friends?
Well I hate to bring it up but you never were very good at it.
It was always you and Niles ever since you were kids.
The two of you always holed up in that damned garage ?
at least until you burned it down.
You burned down the garage?
Well, between Frasier and his Bunsen burner and me and my mosquito repellentÂ in retrospect it was unavoidable!
Still, you know Dad, I did have friends in college and back in Boston.
It's only since I moved to Seattle that I've started falling back on Niles.
Ooh "?
falling back on Niles"?
Niles, you know what I mean.
Settling for what's comfortable and familiar.
My God, you and I can go out together and I know what you're thinking before you even say it.
Well then I'm sorry you had to hear that Frasier!
You know what?
This would make a wonderful topic for my show.
"Making New Friends" What are we so afraid of?
Why do you make everything so complicated?
You wanna meet somebody new?
You just walk up to him, stick out your hand and say "Hi.
How you doing"?
Thank you Dad.
I can always count on you not to overthink something.
Thanks Hey!
MAYBE JUST A SHAMPOO AND SET So why is it we have so much trouble making friends?
Is it because we've become closed off?
No longer want to reach out to our fellow man?
Well I'd like to think that if one of you listeners out there happened to see me on the street you'd feel free to walk right on up to me and?
Excuse me Dr. Crane, we have to stop for a very important public service announcement HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
You're opening yourself up to every creep out there!
Oh Roz that's exactly the kind of cynicism I'm talking about.
I, for one, happen to believe in the kindness of strangers.
Well I believe in the strangeness of strangers!
Three seconds.
Hi, we're back with the topic of friendship.
Now let's go to the switchboard.
Roz, who's on line one?
Good news Dr. Crane.
It's Gerard from Stanwood.
A new friend.
Hello Gerard.
I'm listening.
Well I called for another reason Dr. Crane.
But what you just said really moved me.
I wish more people felt that way.
Well thank you Gerard.
I sense a kindred spirit.
Maybe we could get together some time?
Have a beer?
Maybe I couldÂ you knowÂ comb your hair?
Well thank you so much for your offer of friendship George but I really don't have five thousand dollars to invest in your French fries vending machine.
And for the sake of those who do invest I suggest, Sir, that you find a better name than "The Spuddy Buddy".
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you all good mental health.
I mean that today more than ever!
I just love it when I'm right.
It makes the day so good.
You stacked the deck didn't you?
Oh please.
You should have heard some of the calls I didn't put through let alone these faxes.
Read some of these.
They're sick.
Oh Roz my listeners are not sick?
Although this one does bear watching!
Here's one that has promise.
"Dear Dr. Crane.
I never thought I'd write a letter like this but I was moved by today's show.
As a photographer I come into contact with new people on a daily basis yet I often find it difficult to make that one on one connection.
However your words offered hope and I just wanted to say thank you.
Sincerely.
Bob Reynolds".
Doesn't sound too wacky.
You know what?
I think I'm going to give Mr. Bob Reynolds a call.
Are you nuts?
He could be a raving psychopath with a trunkful of decomposing squirrels.
Oh rubbish Roz.
I'm going to call him.
Where did you come up with such a disgusting image?
Meet Garth from Tacoma.
BUTANE AND THE BEAST You're late today but I'm glad you're here.
I need your help My designer is ready to mutiny if I don't pick a fabric for my new couch.
Now I've brought lots of swatches so make yourself comfortable.
Frankly Niles I'm not here to see you.
I'm meeting a new friend.
A new friend?
Yes, you remember I was talking about widening my circle of friends.
Oh I see.
No more "falling back on Niles" It's not that I'm trying to replace you Niles.
It's just that Bob and I?
Bob?
You're dumping me for someone named Bob?
Niles I am not dumping you.
I'm just worried that Bob might feel awkward meeting the two of us.
Oh well we wouldn't want to make Bob feel uncomfortable now would we?
I mean after all I've only been your brother for38 years now.
What does that mean when there's the possibility that Bob may feel awkward?
There's a man over there who says he's waiting for you.
No doubt the much ballyhooed Bob!
Niles.
Oh it's all right.
It's all right.
I'll go quietly.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
I'll just go home to my Maris.
Oh that's right!
Bob?
Dr. Crane.
No, please..
Call me Frasier.
Frasier then.
I'm glad you called.
Oh..
yes..
Coffee please.
Well uh -So.
-So.
So.
Listen, thank you for your fax.
I listen to your show all the time.
I think you're brilliant.
You're probably sick of hearing that though right?
One would think but it's my cross.
That's the thing I love about your show.
You're not just serious.
You can be funny.
Well, I believe humour can be a therapeutic tool.
Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.
Mark Twain.
"The Mysterious Stranger".
I have a first edition.
I'm a collector myself.
You know I was a bit trepidatious about this experiment Bob, but I'm feeling a real simpatico here.
Yeah, me too.
I'm going to go out on a limb.
What do you say once we finish these coffees we treat ourselves to a proper dinner?
Hey that sounds great.
OK.
Say, what are you reading?
It's my bible.
"The Big Book of Barbecue" by Jeff Filgo.
He's a Texan.
Of course all Texans think they invented barbecue.
Arrogant bastards!
You like barbecue?
WellÂ umÂ national holiday 4th of July.
You know the secret to good barbecue?
Mesquite.
And the secret to mesquite is you gotta soak them in water for 10 minutes.
On special occasions I'll soak them in beer.
Once I soaked them in Sake for that "flavour of the Far East".
You know in Japan they call their barbecues "hibachis"?
The arrogant bastards!
I'm digging my own barbecue pit right now?
Â my speciality is the Shian Smoky Quail.
The trick is a high engulfing flame.
Like a forest fire.
Of course they call forest fires "nature's barbecue".
You know my co-workers call me "Shish-ka-Bob"?
Well Bob.
Do you have any charcoal free interests?
Yeah I'm a professional photographer.
The camera never lies.
I'm a bit of a camera buff myself.
What's your trade?
Photo journalist?
I take kids portraits at Value-Mart Where your dollar buys more!
You know what?
Why don't we talk about this over dinner?
Right..
You know, Bob, about that dinner?
How about Tex-Mex?
You're talking my language.
No you don't.
I'm fixing you a breakfast drink with fresh fruit, yoghurt, carob, pitted prunes.
A healthy body makes for a sunny disposition.
You want sunny?
Let me have my fritter.
Oh shush.
There we are.
There just aren't enough drinks that build up a nice head of black foam!
Morning.
Well you were home late last night.
I had dinner with a new friend.
Bob.
Oh that's right.
Have a good time?
Hardly.
The man talks endlessly on subjects that are of no interest to anyone but him.
Gee.
I can't imagine what that's like.
Oh Dad.
He took me to this God-awful barbecue place.
All they serve is huge platters of charred greasy beef.
The only sound you can hear is the gnawing of meat, the smacking of lips and the clatter of bones hitting the floor.
I can't take it any more.
I'm having that fritter!
If you don't like this man why did you have dinner with him?
Well I was going to tell him that I didn't want to see him anymore but you see it's a bit more delicate than just that.
The problem is he's in a wheel chair.
So what?
If you don't like him you don't like him.
Well I know that.
It's just that I'd hate to have him think it was just because of the chair.
I have worked with the disabled for over 10 years now.
And if it's one thing I've learned they don't want special treatment.
Oh I forgot to bring in the paper.
Daphne would you get it?
My leg's just aching and throbbing!
I'll get it.
You know, Daphne, you're right?
I was kind of a coward wasn't I?
Well, at least I got through the evening.
Here's your paper Buddy!
Bob you're here.
Did we have plans?
No.
I was in the neighbourhood.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Did I mention where I lived?
I'm astonishingly sure I didn't.
You'd be amazed what you can find out with computers today.
Anyway ?
brought bagels, poppy seeds, pumpernickel, rye, sesame, onion, garlic.
'Cos after all breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
Hey-ho you must be Martin.
You're Daphne.
That's right.
And you must be Bob.
That's me.
Bob!
Same forwards as backwards.
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GIVES THE GRIEF Got some messages.
Bob.
Bob.
AndÂ oh lookÂ here's one from Bob.
Can't we just get an unlisted number?
They sort of frown on that with call-in shows.
Frasier you've got to do something about Bob.
I know Roz.
I'm working up to it.
You know the longer you put it off the worse he's going to feel when you finally tell him.
Yes I know that.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm quite capable of dealing with difficult problems in a sensitive mature fashion?
Â Wait!
Did you hear that?
That squeak!
What squeak?
He's here.
It's Bob!
I don't hear anything.
Oh that's right.
Only dogs and I can hear it.
Frasier, you're being paranoid.
It's the sound of his chair.
I'd know it anywhere.
Oh..
my god!
Hi Bob.
Knock Knock Roz.
Frasier around?
You just missed him.
Too bad.
I got great news.
I checked out that vacancy in his apartment building and guess who's gonna be neighbours?
What was that?
Feedback.
This equipment's old and pathetic!
Well maybe I can catch Frasier back at his placeÂ correction, our place.
Bye Bob.
Bye Roz.
OK he's gone.
You can come out now.
No he's not.
He's never really gone!
So Bob's gonna be your new neighbour?
Well, break out the butane there every Barbecue day!
NO!
NO!
He's not going to move into my building.
I won't allow it.
I'm going to talk to him Roz.
Listen, I could use your advice.
You've broken up with a lot of people.
What do you find to be the most effective thing to say?
I love you and I want to have your baby.
Good, I've got my fallback.
Ooh Niles, Niles.
I need to talk.
Bob's meeting me here?
This isn't my usual.
Well it's not for you.
It's for my friend.
That man is your friend?
Yep.
We share thoughts, feelings.
We talk about the arts, current events.
Today we're justÂ hangin'!
There you are.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
You know, I can't stay long.
I've got 4 more pools to clean today besides yours and I'm gonna to lose sunlight.
You know, Ralph, I was thinking that in many ways my profession is a lot like yours.
I start out skimming the surface of the human psyche.
Then I plunge ever deeper into the murky undercurrents, adding chemicals when necessary.
Â There's a lot of leaves this year!
I'm glad you called.
I was starting to get self-conscious here.
It seems like I'm always the one calling or stopping by or suggesting dinner or movies or shopping for hats.
Oh I got you a beaut!
Bob.
You really shouldn't have.
I knew you'd like it, neighbour.
About that Bob.
Have you actually signed a lease yet?
No.
Why?
Well, we need to talk.
Whoa.
If you were a woman I'd swear you were dumping me.
Blue one's nice.
Mmm.
I'm just concerned that blue might be a bit overbearing on a couch of that size.
Although it might complement that Killin rug I was telling you about.
What do you think?
I live in my van!
So you'd probably go for colours that add the illusion of space?
You know, Dr. Crane to be perfectly honest, when you asked if I wanted coffee ?
I thought you were gonna bring me one.
Duly noted Ralph.
Next week you can go back to drinking from the hose.
You see I just don't think there's a basis between us for a sound friendship.
Neither of us should feel bad about it.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not the one being rejected.
No, no.
I'm not rejecting you.
Truth is you're pleasant.
You're charming.
Frasier, I'm an adult here.
At least respect me enough to tell me what it is you don't like about me.
Well all right, all right.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
You talk on endlessly about subjects that I have no interest in.
You call me all the time.
Frankly you're suffocating me!
Wow.
I don't know what to say.
I wish you'd said something sooner.
I wanted to.
Frankly I was afraid you'd think it was because of theÂ you know?
The what?
The wheelchair.
Why would I think that?
I don't know.
I just wanted you to know that.
I wish it did have to do with the chair.
I beg your pardon.
Well, if the chair were your problem that would make you a jerk.
This way, I'm the jerk.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
Come on, you just did.
You just said I'm boring and obnoxious.
Who knows people better than you?
You can keep the hat.
Bob, wait, please.
I've got to level with you.
Truth is I find nothing wrong with you.
I was just ashamed to admit it.
It is the chair.
What?
I think frankly that you are wonderful company.
Wildly stimulating.
Your hobbies are so fascinating.
You have a sense of style that really, I mean, doesn't compare to anyone's.
It's just me.
I feel petty and small about it but I can't get past the chair.
I'm sorry Bob.
Please.
I'm sorry.
This is goodbye.
I don't believe this.
You don't want to be my friend 'cos I'm in a wheelchair.
What?
That's the worst thing I've ever heard!
Look.
You don't understand.
What's not to understand.
You just said flat out ?
my chair repulses you What kind of a person does that?
I've got a birthmark on my back.
I guess we can't be friends either!
People please.
Frankly this doesn't concern any of you.
When I think about all the gifts I gave you.
All the barbecue sauce ?
Hot 'n' Spicy, Tex Mex, Mesquite, Teriyaki, Honey Mustard?
Oh For God's sake Bob ?
put a sock in it.
We were just on our way to dinner.
Would you like to join us?
I'd love to.
So.
You guys like barbecue?
Yeah.
Who doesn't?
Are these wing tips too busy with these pants?
Well, yes.
They're a bit frenzied.
Perhaps a woven lace would tone down the glitz.
Might have to go overseas for that.
No, not at all.
You can get them downtown.
Well, who shops downtown anymore?
Well I do for one?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Morning.
Morning.
Morning?
Oh my God, Joe, get up!
Get up!
You were supposed to be out of here hours ago.
You promised me that after we did the deed you'd be on your merry way.
I was.
Get dressed.
We've got to get you out of here before Dr. Crane gets up.
Oh, no.
I smell coffee.
They're already up!
Now don't worry.
I'll just lay low until the two of them Oh my God, it's nine o'clock.
I'm a half-hour late for work.
Just give me a minute.
I'll get rid of them.
Where's my underwear?
Eddie, get back here!
Good morning.
Maybe for you.
I just spent five minutes trying to button these pants.
That stupid dryer shrunk another pair on me.
Dad.
Before you blame the dryer, have you ever considered stepping on the old bathroom scales?
Oh, what's the point?
That thing's been ten pounds off for weeks.
Daphne?
Good morning, Dr. Crane.
Sorry I overslept.
Well, time we all got our day started.
I'll just clear these dishes away.
Wait, I wasn't finished with that yet.
Whoops.
Sorry about that.
Daphne, I wasn't quite finished with that toast either.
Oh, now, we can't have you running off to your squash game on a full stomach.
Yes ?
how many championship matches have been marred by the heartbreak of toast cramp?
Don't you have that Doctor's appointment?
Yes, but it's not for 20 minutes yet.
What's going on here?
Why are you giving us the bum's rush?
Bum's rush!
Oh, I just love the American vernacular.
So cute.
So quick.
So long!
Better get my wallet first.
Damn pants!
You know ?
you spend fifteen dollars on a good pair of pants - you expect them to be shrink resistant.
Well, Dad, when you pay that kind of money what you're really paying for is the designer name!
Gotta go.
I'm so late.
Oh hurry, hurry, hurry!
I'll call you tonight.
OK.
Bye.
OH..
GOD OH..
GOD Oh!
Hello Joe.
Hi Dr. Crane.
I just came by to give Daphne a kiss.
And drop off these shoes.
Here!
Oh, thank you.
Well.
Can anyone think of anything to make this moment a bit more awkward than it already is?
Thank you, Eddie!
THEY'RE PLAYING DO-SI-DO, BUT NOT FOR ME Oh..
Thank you very much Isn't that Dirk and Gabby Bindercott?
Friends of yours?
Mmm.
Filthy rich.
Timber money.
In their case it really does grow on trees!
Dirk!
Gabby!
Oh, Dirk?
Hello, Niles.
Dirk Bindercott ?
my brother Dr. Frasier Crane.
Ah ?
I've heard your program.
Well ?
I've seen your wife.
So Niles ?
I suppose I'll see you at the benefit on Sunday.
I know Maris is coming.
Yes, Sunday.
Which benefit is Sunday?
I have so many benefits on Sunday.
The ho-down for the homeless.
You were invited?
The ho-down?
Yippee-kai-yes!
Must be Gabby.
Certainly sounds like her.
See you Sunday.
Yes.
Till Sunday.
I wasn't invited.
Niles, it's one party.
Yes, but when you're off the A-list for one party you're off for all of them.
From now on I'll be relegated to B-list charity events.
Grubby little theatre companies and last year's diseases.
This often happens in these cases when two people separate ?
their friends choose one spouse over the other.
Surely they chose Maris because she's better connected and has more money than you do.
Exactly which part of that was meant to ease my pain?
Niles, I just think you're overreacting.
Oh wait, wait.
I know what happened.
My invitation just got lost in the mail.
No ?
it's not so far fetched.
It could have been missorted or a stamp could have fallen off or it could have been stolen by my mail carrier.
Ho-downs are catnip to postal workers!
Well I'd ask you to explain that but then you would!
I'm going to check with the post office.
You know ?
I heard a story on the news the other day about a man who bought a piano at auction and when he went to tune it he found a 40-year-old unmailed letter under the sounding board.
Perhaps we should contact Feronte and Tisha  ?
see if they have your invitation?
Poke fun now.
We'll see who feels foolish this Sunday when I'm sipping champagne atop a mechanical bull!
Cappuccino, please.
Roz, I want to get your take on something.
What?
Well.
Daphne and Joe are having sex in my apartment and it leaves me in a rather awkward position.
Doing what?
Bending over to look through the keyhole?
Oh Frasier, come on, what is the big deal?
Well, let's just say that I'm sitting there listening to music, reading a book and Daphne and Joe are "back there".
So?
Well, it just makes me uncomfortable.
I'm going to ask Daphne not to sleep with Joe in the house anymore.
Is that too?
Amish?
I was going to say selfish!
Oh, let's see.
Please Daphne ?
don't have sex.
It disturbs my reading!
No, that's not too selfish.
Well, I just don't think a man should be uncomfortable in his own home.
How am I supposed to relax when every giggle, every noise makes me you know?
Picture it?
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.
The very idea.
You're picturing it right now, aren't you?
Well, you made me.
Hey, Fras.
Hey, Dad.
Is Daphne in?
Yeah, and if you have any sense you'll pretend that nothing happened this morning.
Ah, yes.
Denial.
The sort of advice I'd expect from a man whose driver's license still lists his hair colour as brown.
It was until you came back to town!
Daphne.
I think we need to discuss what happened this morning.
It's been bothering me all day.
It was entirely my fault.
No, no.
I share the blame.
We never did have a formal discussion about the rules of the house, especially when it comes to you know I do want to apologise for any embarrassment I may have caused.
You see, we can't go to Joe's because he's still building his house and he sleeps on a friend's couch.
But I can assure you it will never happen again.
Well, then our business is concluded.
Meeting adjourned.
The next time Joe spends the night, I'll notify you well in advance.
Daphne.
I was just reviewing the minutes of our last meeting.
There seems to be some confusion.
Oh?
You see, my quibble is not with the lack of notification.
I am just not comfortable with you and Joe sleeping together under my roof.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry about that, but it is my room, isn't it?
Oh yes, yes.
And I want you to feel comfortable living here.
I suppose it's more important for you to feel comfortable because, as you said, it is your roof.
Oh.
Thank you for understanding.
Not at all.
Joe and I are going away for the weekend but first thing Monday I'm going to start looking for me own place.
Guess who?
Daphne em I don't want you entertaining here but I also don't want you to move out.
Oh, I see.
So you want me to stay, but just not have a personal life?
Well No, no.
That works out fine for me.
I'll just spend all day waiting on you and your father, then in the evenings retire to me room, wrap meself in an Afghan and wait for the morning.
And if my whimpering gets too loud for you ?
you can just have me fixed like Eddie!
That is not what I meant.
This is difficult for both of us, Daphne.
I have to express my feelings.
I also don't want to lose you.
You're very important to me and my father.
That's why my solution is best.
I'll still be here during the day to take care of your father but nights and weekends I'll just go home to my own place.
On top of which you can turn this room back into your beautiful study you used to have.
Well ?
I suppose, what other choice do we have?
Of course it'll be a period of adjustment for all of us I know how much you two care about me and consider me part of the family but You're picturing your study right now, aren't you?
Well, you made me!
She's such a groovy lady!
Morning, Dad.
Oh, morning.
You seen the phone?
Oh, I probably left it in my room again.
Sorry.
Hey, I'm making breakfast Burritos.
You want one?
I'll passo!
Suit yourself.
Dad.
Whatever happened to the silk pajamas I bought you?
Oh, Frasier, they're too la-dee-da for me.
Besides, they shrank!
Whoa ?
there go my tater-tots.
You want a pile?
Not that I don't enjoy a "pile" of breakfast as much as the next guy but I still think no.
Dad, are you planning on going around like that all weekend?
Yeah, why not?
Daphne's off on her little trip.
It's just us guys.
Besides I've been wearing pants round here for three years.
Enough!
I see.
Look Dad, I just have to do this Thank you All right.
Now, listen.
It's no big deal but I couldn't find the remote control for the TV last night.
Now I thought we agreed that its place was on that table next to my chair.
What was it like in the old days when you actually had to get up to change the channel?
It was hell!
You expecting someone?
The contractor.
I'm getting an estimate on restoring my study.
Why don't you use Joe?
I think Joe's done enough work in that room, thank you!
Henry.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
No sweat.
I'll just show you the room.
Oh, this is my father.
Don't get up!
Like a cup of coffee?
That'd be great.
Fine.
Look, the room is right down the hall there to the right.
I'll meet you there.
OK.
Oh, Dad.
This is a small thing but you left the sponge in the sink again.
So?
Well, as I mentioned last evening, if it stays wet, not only does it begin to smell but it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.
So?
So.
If I were to say wipe up that salsa that you spilled on the table just now I would be leaving behind bacteria such as salmonella, lysteria, flagella.
Now wouldn't that bother you?
Yeah, I guess you're right ?
it would bother me.
I wouldn't dream of touching that sponge now!
Ah, yes.
Our own foul-breathed little handy wet!
HE CRIED WITH HIS BOOTS ON You've been leaving lights on in the apartment all weekend.
You know what that does to the electric bill?
Suppose there's a nuclear power plant they had to build to keep that television on day and night?
You moved my chair again, didn't you?
No!
Oh well, maybe Eddie did it.
Eddie, you move my chair?
'Cause Frasier said he didn't do it and Frasier never messes around with my stuff.
All right, I moved your damn chair.
The way you have it turned ruins the symmetry of the room.
The sight line loses all flow.
Oh, the sight line.
And here I thought it was for some dumb reason.
Would you get Eddie off of the couch, or else it's down through the garbage chute for the thrill ride of his life!
Well, howdy partner.
Save your snippy remarks.
Fair enough.
Say, am I crazy or is there a bright golden haze on the meadow?
Stop it.
I'm in the middle of a social crisis.
I just drove to the ho-down for the homeless assuming that Maris had simply neglected to forward my invitation.
Well, not only was I not on the guest list but Nelson, the parking attendant, said he missed me at "The Luau for Lupus".
Now it is official.
I'm a social outcast.
Oh Niles, why do you even care about those people?
In your hour of need they pretend you don't even exist.
They treat you like you're a leper, a non-person.
But I really, really like them.
I know, I know ?
it makes me sound pathetic.
But I'm newly separated.
These people have been my social circle for ten years.
Frasier ?
they're my tribe.
Well, I hate to break this to you, "Waltzes With Snobs," but they have left you on the mountaintop to die!
Now Niles, maybe your friends wanted to invite you but they probably thought you'd be upset seeing Maris there.
Of course.
You're absolutely right.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Oh, why are you so negative?
These people do care about me.
Oh fine, very well.
Why don't you just call them?
Prove to me I'm wrong.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Where's your phone?
It's in my bedroom.
Where else would it be?
And Dad's electric shaver is in the kitchen.
You see, all our appliances are on an adventure this weekend.
Well, are you proud of yourself, stirring things up?
Why didn't you just let him think his friends were doing him a favour?
Ah, yes.
The Martin Crane approach.
Better living through denial!
You did the same thing with Daphne.
You couldn't just pretend that nothing was going on back there.
Dad, I'm a psychiatrist.
I don't pretend.
I confront.
I resolve.
Oh yeah, you really resolved this.
Now she's moving out.
You know, I swear you just go looking for trouble.
Oh, that is so untrue.
AND PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS!
!
!
A grown man's obsession with a sponge?
No, I can't!
For the last two days I've asked you again and again as politely as I can to wring out the sponge.
But you don't even have the consideration to respect my feelings.
Because your feelings are stupid!
But they're my feelings!
And important to me!
And because of that you should have the courtesy to respect them.
Just like you respect my feelings when I asked you not to move my chair.
Oh, that makes no sense at all.
Oh, all right.
You want me to dry that sponge?
'll dry that sponge!
Give it about a minute.
Oh, that's mature.
Oh, boy ?
you know what a tortured little world you live in?
Newspapers strewn all over the place.
Sponge germs coming after you.
It's a wonder you can sleep at night!
Oh, my dreams get me by.
Like the one where I strap you in your chair and run around the house turning on all the lights even in the rooms I'm nowhere near.
Boy, that electric meter must really be spinning now!
Evening, all.
Did you boys have a nice weekend?
Barrel of laughs!
Well, I had the loveliest time.
Hey ?
Off!
We found this little bed-and-breakfast right up the coast.
I talked my decision over with Joe, and he agreed it really is the best thing for everyone.
Of course I'll still be here during the day to help your father with his exercises.
But nights and weekends it'll just be you two carefree bachelors getting into trouble together.
I'm usually just underfoot around here anyway.
So you see, my decision is best for everyone.
Well, I've had a long weekend, so good night.
Night, Daphne.
Frasier.
What?
You know how an Oreo has that soft creamy filling between two hard cookies?
That's what keeps them together?
See your point, Dad.
Daphne's kind of the centre.
I'll go and talk to her.
Now, you and me, we'd be the cookie part.
I get it!
May I come in?
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Daphne.
Daphne er you can't go.
You have to stay.
I've only just recently realised how important you are to us.
You see, if you go, Dad and I will kill each other.
I'm not just tossing out hyperbole here.
I'm speaking in the most literal sense.
Dad and I ?
both dead!
Only he'll be lying there with a bacteria-ridden sponge protruding from his mouth like a bloated tongue.
You don't really want that on your conscience, do you?
No, of course not.
Truth is, I do still think of this place as my home.
But I know you'd never be comfortable knowing Joe and I were I'd be willing to try.
I know you better than that.
It'll bother you and we'll both be miserable.
Why can't I get past this?
Oh, it'd just be easier if I could be like my father pretending you weren't in here making love.
Making love?
Is that what you think we were doing?
Yes, of course.
Oh no.
There was nothing like that going on in here.
Really?
Seems rather implausible.
I'd like to believe that and believe me I really do want to er how can I?
Well, how could Joe and I make love?
What with er Joe's war injury?
I didn't even know Joe was a soldier.
What war would that be?
The Falkland Islands.
But that was a British conflict and Joe's not His parents have a summerhouse there!
Oh, that's very unfortunate.
Having a summerhouse in a war zone.
But how-?
He was kicked by a sheep.
A sheep?
Yes, a sheep ?
spooked by an air raid siren.
Work with me.
Oh, I see.
So, what you're saying is that Joe Can't.
Ah.
Well, I suppose that changes everything.
Ys, I suppose it does.
But just so as we're clear - even though there's no actual lovemaking, Joe and I can on occasion, say, read poems to each other in here at night?
As long as you don't read too loudly.
She's staying.
Turns out they're sleeping together but not having sex.
See, they can't have sex because of an injury Joe suffered when kicked by a spooked sheep during an air raid while his family were vacationing in the Falkland Islands during the war.
Well, Dad was right.
They are my real friends.
It was all just a misunderstanding.
Apparently the social chairman's dog ate my invitation.
And the poor animal had to go to the vet and with all the confusion they forgot to send me another, and when I offered my new address for next year's party, they said, "no need ?
we'll see you around".
I'm going to start wearing sweat pants.
That damned drier again.
Hey, you guys want some cookies?
They're reduced fat.
Really?
That means we can eat twice as many.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Well, we've got about thirty seconds.
I think we've got time for one quick call.
Hello, Marlene, I'm listening.
Oh my God, I'm really on?
Yes, your problem, please Lucky, Lucky, get down.
George, get the dog!
Oh my God, this is so exciting!
Honey, honey, get the baby.
George, get your son!
OK, OK, here it is, Dr. Crane: if my husband and I don't find some time to have sex soon, I think I'm gonna burst.
I may even have to go to a department store and pick up a stranger.
Oh, kids!
Look who's here without calling first, Nana and Pop Pop!
I'll call you back.
Well, to all you Marlenes out there, may I suggest that sex with a stranger is not the answer.
Why don't you just pack the kids off with Nana and Pop Pop, lock Lucky downstairs in the basement, grab your husband, take him to the sturdiest kitchen table you have, and let the postman ring twice!
Now, to the rest of my listeners, I'll be off on vacation for the next week, so please tune in to my replacement, the noted podiatrist, Dr Garreth Wooten, who'll be discussing the virtues of his new book, "Bunions and Blisters and Corns," Oh My!
I hate it when that weird foot freak subs for you.
Couldn't you just have Frederick come and visit you here?
Sorry Roz, the taxi's waiting outside to take me to the airport.
Oh well, have a great time.
Oh, thanks.
And don't forget to bring me a present!
I'll get you a nice T-shirt from Colonial Williamsburg.
You're taking Frederick to Williamsburg?
Eeew!
No, it's a wonderful vacation spot!
We're going to dip candles, tan leather, churn butter Hey, Frederick Crane, you just finished the first grade, what are you going to do now?
I'm going to Butterworld!
Hey Daphne, bring that laundry over here, will you?
What for?
Well, I was just reading about an intelligence test you can give your dog.
You throw a towel over its head and see how long it takes him to shake it off.
Eddie!
Oh, and the faster he takes the towel off, the smarter he is?
No, the faster he folds it.
All right, they ranked all the dogs and the smartest was a border collie; he did it in seven seconds.
All right, come on boy, take it off.
Six seven.
OK, the next fastest one was a poodle, I know he's as smart as a poodle.
OK, so he's no poodle he's not a beagle either or a German shepherd or a Labrador Oh, for God's sake, Eddie!
Yes, well, if you ask me, he's refusing to do that trick because he knows if he does it right, you'll have him doing it every time we have company.
Hey, I'll bet you're right!
Nice going, Eddie!
Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.
I appreciate the false cheer, Daphne.
But I'm sure you've seen this?
Today's society page?
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me!
I'm saving it for after dinner!
Apparently Maris is going on a three-week cruise.
Her friends threw her a bon voyage party.
Look at the photo.
It's Maris on the arm of Pierson Broadwater.
Oh, Dr. Crane, look!
She's just standing there, barely touching him, with only the tiniest bit of a smile on her face!
I know, you can practically hear the zing zing zing of her heartstrings!
Oh, Dr Crane Sorry, Niles.
Oh, it gets worse.
This morning I spoke to Marta, my ex-maid and current mole.
She reports that Broadwater is just the latest in a parade of escorts.
The gigolos are swarming around Maris like ants on a Snickers bar!
Well, wait a minute, that's good news.
If she's seeing a whole bunch of people, that means she's not serious about any one of them.
You think?
Yeah, sure!
They're probably just her escorts.
You know how she loves going to parties.
Yes, and she never liked going anywhere alone.
Except to bed.
More good news.
And Niles, it wouldn't hurt you to go out a little bit every once in a while too.
If you're suggesting that I start dating, you can save your breath.
Women don't exactly find me irresistible.
Oh, come on, Niles, you've had lots of girlfriends.
Oh, let's count.
There's Maris oh no, Dora, my childhood pen pal from Costa Rica I seem to recall a little girl in the fourth grade who lured me to a stairwell to show me her underpants.
You know, Niles, I think your problem is you still picture yourself as the same geeky kid you were in high school.
But you've come a long way since then.
And you're not doing yourself any favours sitting home every night.
Now just think about it.
Wine, Dr. Crane?
Well, wouldn't you?
HE WAS A BAND LEADER MARRIED TO CHARO Oh, give it up, the man had every right to be proud of his dog.
Well, I just don't like show-offs, OK?
"Ginger, catch the frisbee.
Ginger, roll over.
Ginger, do my taxes"!
Just because Eddie's not good at tricks The hell he isn't!
He just likes the kind that gives him a chance to use his brain!
Eddie's a thinker!
Just watch this.
Open the door for him.
Now, I've been teaching him the names of all his chew toys.
Eddie, get your banana.
Now he's thinking, "which one's the banana"?
Now he's thinking, "what the heck did I do with my banana"?
Now he's thinking, "which one's the emergency button"?
Come on!
Oh, Dr Crane!
Hello.
I let myself in, I hope that's all right.
Fine.
What's up?
Oh, I just stopped by to ask you a question.
Are you free Saturday night?
Sure!
Well, I'm not!
I have a date!
Oh!
Oh!
Bravo, Dr. Crane!
Good for you!
Who is she?
Marjorie Nash, the "Fruit On The Bottom" yogurt heiress.
I bumped into her at the Frye museum.
Before I knew it, your advice was thundering in my ears.
I found myself asking her out.
We'll be attending our club's annual winter dance, the "Snow Ball"!
Good for you!
What's she like?
Well, she's terribly haughty and rumours persist about her husband's death.
But still, a date's a date!
Snow Ball?
Sounds very glamourous.
I didn't know you could dance!
Oh, I can't.
Oh, dear.
You don't think she'll want me to?
I've taken Maris to dozens of these things, she's never once asked to dance of course, Maris dislikes public displays of rhythm.
Oh, this is terrible!
My first date's a miserable failure before it even begins.
I'll just have to cancel.
All you need are a few dancing lessons.
I'd be happy to give you some.
You would?
Yeah!
Growing up, I used to practise all the time with my brother Billy - the ballroom dancer?
I couldn't prevail upon you like that, it would be too much trouble.
We'll have to move this!
OK, now push the chair back Or not.
Alright, we'll start with the box step.
Box step It's very simple.
Take my hand like so, and your other hand goes around my waist.
Now, start with your left foot.
OK, which one?
Oh, hush!
Step towards me, then bring your right foot forward-and-over, and slide the left over to meet it.
Then the right foot goes back, the left back-and-over, and the right slides next to it.
And that's it!
All right, once again.
A one-two- Oh!
three, a two-two-three, a three-two-three, a four-two three This is boring yet difficult.
Aw, there's no trick to dancing.
It's just a matter of coordination.
Hell, if you can ride a bike, or skip rope, or kick a ball, you can certainly Alright, once again.
A one-two- Oh!
-three You're really doing very well, Dr. Crane.
Earlier you seemed a bit tense.
You've really relaxed now though, haven't you?
Hey, you two are looking pretty sharp.
Well, I think we're ready to move on to the samba.
Eddie, fetch me a samba tape.
Xavier Cougat.
Now he's thinking, "the later Hollywood stuff, or the early New York recordings"?
Now guess what I'm thinking.
I'll get it myself.
Well, I'm going to hit the hay.
Good-night -- bend-and-turn ?
see-you-in-the-morning ?
spin-and-dip there's-my-phone -- flip-and-push ?
Niles-Crane.
Oh, Marjorie.
How are you?
Oh, what a shame.
Well, er, no no it's alright, there'll be other dances.
No, no, I understand completely.
Take care.
Guess I won't be needing those dancing lessons.
I guess not.
I'm sorry, son.
I couldn't find any Cougie, but this'll do!
Alright now, in the samba you have to hold me a little closer.
You ready?
Daphne, there's one thing I wanted to mention Yeah?
I'm a dancer, a dancer dances!
WHERE ELSE WOULD CORONERS GET TOGETHER?
Wow..
Look who's Here..
it's my dancing partner.
Hello, Fred!
Hello, Ginger!
It's a little joke we have!
Look Daphne, I got two new CDs today.
Tonight we master the mambo and the conga.
I can feel myself growing a pencil-thin moustache just saying that.
You're having more lessons tonight?
Oh, yes!
He's going to be the best dancer at the ball.
I'll just go get us some coffees.
Why didn't you tell her your date had cancelled?
You don't need more lessons.
I wanted to, but she's just having so much fun!
Come on, Niles, you think I don't see the way you look at Daphne?
What are you implying?
You know damn well what I'm implying.
Take my word for it, you're sticking a fork in the toaster here.
Well, my muffin's stuck!
Besides, what's the harm in a few dance lessons?
It's nighttime.
You're alone.
The music's on.
You've got your arms around her.
You'll end up saying something you can't take back.
I have no intention of saying anything.
No one ever does.
Take my word for it.
When I was separated from your mother, there was this pretty coroner in the city morgue.
I always had a bit of a crush on her.
So whenever we'd find a dead body, I'd yell out, "OK boys, I'll take it from here"!
So one night, I invited her down to the corner bar.
Coroners have their own bars?
No, corner, Niles, the corner bar!
Anyway, we had a few drinks, the lights were low, Sinatra on the jukebox.
Before I knew it, it just all came pouring out of me.
I told her how I felt.
I mean, I knew the second it was out of my mouth that it was a mistake.
She let me down easy but we still had to go on seeing each other all the time.
It sure was no fun going to the morgue after that!
So, what time are we starting your lessons tonight, Dr. Crane?
Actually, that won't be necessary.
I just got a call from Marjorie.
Something's come up.
I won't be going to the ball.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry.
It's quite all right, and thank you for all your help.
It seems such a shame to waste all that hard work I hope you don't think I'm being too forward, but what would you say about our going to the dance together?
Now, now, he's already taken up too much of your time, Daphne, he couldn't ask you to do that.
No, but it would be as much fun for me as it would be for him!
I'd love an elegant evening out!
What do you say, Dr. Crane?
Tell her what you say, Dr. Crane.
Pick you up at seven?
Ooh, yes!
Great!
No, Eddie that's not your banana, that's Mr. Pig.
Listen to the difference: pig, banana!
Pig, banana!
Pig, banana!
Ah, I still love you, you little pinhead.
Go sit down.
Oh Frasier, am I glad you're back!
Listen, all sorts of.
Dad, please, please!
I have just spent the most wonderful six days with Frederick.
I am technically still on vacation till ten a.m. tomorrow.
Yeah, but listen Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!
Dad, I do not care to know how hard Daphne made you exercise, or about the boring foreign film Niles made you sit through, or about the progress of Eddie's on-again, off-again romance with the ottoman!
But you don't understand Dad, please!
For all intents and purposes, I am not here.
That'll be my date!
Ooh, I'm so excited, this is me first ball!
Oh, I hope he likes my dress Daphne?
Hello, Dr. Crane, welcome back!
Hello!
Wow!
Ohhh, you!
Niles?
Oh, Frasier, you're back!
Well, our carriage awaits.
And you'd better get her home at a decent hour, I'm gonna be waiting up for you!
Oh, Mr. Crane!
What the hell was that?
Eddie, did you hear sumpin'?
Can't be Frasier, he's still on vacation!
Dad, what was that?
Dad, will you stop kidding around?
Was that a date?
Dad!
Oh, Dr. Crane, it's so beautiful!
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?
You know, when I was at school I knew a boy named Niles.
I called him Niley.
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?
You're a vision everyone's staring at you!
Well, you look awfully handsome yourself Niles.
Would you like some champagne?
Oh, that would be lovely.
Be back in a moment.
Two champagnes, tout de suite.
Niles, dear!
How are you!
Just fine, thanks.
Andrew, say hello to Niles.
Haven't seen you for ages.
Feel just terrible about you and Maris.
Oh yes, we were just devastated.
Positively everyone's talking about it.
Oh, and how is positively everyone?
Devastated.
We were just saying that to Maris, when we ran into her and Bradley Paxton at the Breever's Cup.
No, she was with Calvin Oldi at the Breever's Cup.
Well, it's so hard to keep track anyway.
Niles, if there's anything we can do to cheer you up?
Just let us know Perhaps a murder-suicide pact.
Well, they weren't very nice!
Well, everyone in our set seems to have this idea that while Maris is out living the high life, I'm sitting at home, crushed and lonely.
Yeah, well, never mind those gossipy twits.
Tonight, you're all mine.
Now take me in your arms, Niles, and let the music carry us away Thank you, we'll be back in ten minutes.
I can't remember when I've had a better time.
I'm on Cloud Nine!
I'd have to look down to see Cloud Nine!
Daphne, I must tell you again, that is an exquisite gown.
Oh, thanks!
It was way out of my price range, but did you ever see something and say, "I just have to have it"?
Where's my chair?
A tango!
Oh, you never taught me a tango!
Oh, you'll love it!
It's perfect for you!
This is a passionate, full-blooded dance that rose up from the slums of Buenos Aires.
Well, the parallels between me and an unemployed gaucho aside, I think we probably should just sit this one out.
Oh, nonsense!
There's only one rule in the tango: our bodies must be in continuous contact, with not a sliver of daylight between us.
I can do that.
Stop!
Don't be afraid!
Daphne won't let anything happen to you.
I don't think- Don't think!
Just feel.
You're an Argentine slum-dweller.
You have no house, no car, you don't know where your next meal is coming from.
But none of that matters.
Because tonight we have the tango!
Oh mama, I've got it all!
That's it!
You're dazzling!
You're brilliant!
But I feel you're holding back!
I am.
Oh, this is no time for inhibitions!
I know.
Oh.
let it out Niles.
Let everything out!
Oh Daphne, I adore you!
I adore you too!
What?
!
?
!
?
I adore you too.
Oh, how I've longed to hear those words!
Oh, how I've longed to say them!
You're beautiful!
You're a goddess!
I don't ever want this moment to end!
Then let's not let it!
This is the most glorious night of my life.
Oh, mine too Oh, Daphne!
I'm a new man!
Do you have any idea what I'm feeling?
Of course I do!
Your friends look positively dumbstruck.
From now on there'll be no more of that "oh poor Niles" attitude Far from it!
I knew you were a good dancer, but I had no idea you were such a good actor!
Actor?
Yeah!
"Daphne, you're a goddess, Daphne, I adore you" We fooled everyone, didn't we?
Ohoh.
We certainly did, didn't we?
I'm surprised it was so easy!
Well, given the right circumstances, anyone can be fooled.
Ooh!
What do you say to another dance?
No thanks, it's getting late and I've danced enough.
Alright, then!
I'll just go powder my nose and then we'll be off.
Niles?
No, no, please.
Claire Barnes?
I was an associate in your attorney's office.
Oh, yes, Claire.
Uh, it's good to see you again.
Well, I heard about you and Maris.
And I just wanted to give you my card and tell you you're free to call me anytime.
Oh, thank you, but I'm happy with my attorney.
I meant to go dancing.
OHThanks..
Well, are you ready?
Ah..
No, I don't think I am.
I beg your pardon?
Er, I mean yes.
Uh, let's go.
Well, we certainly had fun tonight, didn't we?
We certainly did.
And to think you almost didn't come to the ball!
You know, it's such a shame when people let fear stop them from trying new things.
Excuse me.
I'm ready now.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780.
Frasier, that was security.
Some woman insisted on seeing you, she just blew right past them.
Oh, don't panic, Roz Â probably just one of my more ardent fans.
Niles, we've got to talk!
It's urgent.
Frasier, I'm with a patient!
- Is, uh, this about a woman?
- Yes.
Take all the time you need.
- Well?
- She's back the scourge of my existence.
Strange, I usually get some sign when Lilith is in town Â dogs forming into packs, blood weeping down the wall.
I'm talking about Diane Chambers.
Lucille, send Mr. Carr home.
She just showed up at the station today.
Apparently some play she wrote is being produced here in town.
I admit, I just sort of panicked when I saw her, but I think I covered it masterfully.
All right, all right, all right.
Well, uh, why do you think you reacted that way?
Oh, spare me the psychiatrist bit, Niles.
That includes putting down the pad!
In the drawer, Niles!
Fine.
My first question to you is this: Are you still in love with her?
No!
Not in the least!
It's a ridiculous suggestion.
Seeing as how I have nowhere to write the phrase, "classic denial," I'll move on.
So, about this woman for whom you have so little feeling that you raced across town and burst into one of my sessions Â is there any lingering resentment?
Over what?
!
Well, she did leave at the altar.
When you told her how that made you feel, was there anything you left unsaid?
Any phrase or feeling you wished you had expressed to her?
I'm making the assumption here that you did tell her how you felt.
I sort of did.
"Sort of" is another one of those phrases that just wants to go in my pad.
I expressed my distaste for the way I'd been treated, yes.
Frasier, she rejected you in the most debilitating way a man can be rejected.
You've got to more than "sort of" tell her how that felt.
Well, I can't just tell Diane how awful she made me feel now!
It's a distant memory for her.
I'd feel weak!
You have no reason to feel weak.
You've moved on in your life too.
You have a new career, new wealth, new success.
You simply need closure in this one area.
- You know, what you just said made a lot of sense.
- You're going to get closure.
No, that business about my success!
I tuned you out after that.
I'm going to invite Diane over for dinner tonight, and I'm really gonna flaunt my success, really rub her nose in it!
That'll prove I'm not just some cast-aside that never got over her.
Niles, I know it's not psychologically sound.
But we're still human.
We have to do what feels good sometimes, don't we?
I'd just like to be on the record as saying I'm against it.
- Fine.
- You know the path that leads to peace with Diane and you're rejecting it.
- Yes.
- I'm washing my hands of the entire matter.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world though, would you?
- I'll be there at seven with a cheeky Bordeaux.
No, no, no.
Daphne, I was very specific about this.
The mayor's plaque goes on the piano The Otis Klandenning "Man of the Year Award" goes right over here And my jewel Â my SeaBea Â goes right here where she can't miss it!
Hmm, that seems a bit subtle.
- Why don't I just use this to serve the olives?
- Give me that!
I wish someone would just tell me who this woman is, and why we're trying to impress the pants off her.
She's a one-time Boston barmaid who had a nervous breakdown and ended up in a sanitorium, where I met her, fell for her,..
and then was so mercilessly rejected by her that to this day there is a sucking chest wound where once there dwelled a heart!
You remember my brother Niles, my father Martin, and this is his health-care worker, Daphne Moon.
- What a tasteful abode.
- Well, it's modest in its way.
No, that's what I like about it.
After the rambling beach house I've been living in, I'm ready for something smart and efficient.
White wine, Diane?
I'm pouring an '85 Montrachet La Guiche I purchased at auction.
Oh, I always keep a bottle of that open myself.
Hang this up!
Well, Martin, it's been too long.
How have you been?
Well, my wife died, I got shot in the hip, and I had to move in with Frasier 'cause I kept falling down in the shower.
Well, you look wonderful!
Yes, you do!
That's the bad one.
Niles, do you remember the last time I was in town and we dined together?
You had just started dating this woman Â she was the queerest little creature.
She ate everyone's sorbet, and then she had to lie down in the ladies' lounge while the coat-check girl massaged her abdomen!
Oh, I hope I haven't put my foot in it.
You and she didn't get married and live happily ever after, did you?
No, can't say as we did.
- Care for an olive?
- Oh, thank you.
These are a Pyreenean taste treat!
They're handpicked and bottled by Andalusian monks!
You can spit the pits in here.
So, there I was, on the balcony of my Malibu beachhouse, when a pod of whales passed by.
I knew I had to commune with these gentle giants, so like a flash, I was on the beach, scrambling to my kayak.
But cruel fortune interceded, when, not twenty yards offshore, I suddenly discovered myself entangled in an enormous bed of-of, umÂ - Sea kelp?
- Exactly right, sea kelp!
Oh, that's funny Â I thought he said "seek help".
So, you haven't told us how you've come to be in Seattle.
Oh, a small theater group has decided to produce a play I've written.
- Which one?
- Oh, my most recent work.
It's a sort of feminist odyssey, experimental in places, in tone akin to Saroyan, with a soupÃ§on of Gide, and a hearty nod to Clifford Odets!
I meant which theater?
- Oh!
The Roundabout.
- That seems appropriate.
You know, why don't you people just keep talking amongst yourselves?
I will go and fetch the profiteroles.
They were prepared by the hottest new pastry chef in oh, what's the use?
I'll help.
He always overpowders.
Yeah, I'm sure Old Man Kennedy felt this kind of pride when his boys would go out and play touch football.
Now, Frasier, you know her better than I. Is that what she looks like when she's writhing in envy?
Oh, shut up.
All right, I admit you were right.
Before she leaves here tonight, I am going to tell her how much pain she made me feel.
The savage truth this time Â there will be no sugarcoating it!
And yes, I am aware of the irony!
Oh, it must be wonderful to see your words come to life like that.
Oh yes.
It's a dream come true.
- Diane, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Why?
- Well, your cheek was kind of twitching.
- It was?
- Oh well, it was probably fatigue.
Where were we?
- Oh, I was asking about your play.
- Oh, right!
- There it goes again, the twitch!
That was either a very large twitch or a very small seizure.
You know, I'm not sure how much I really want to talk about my play right now.
Bad luck and all that!
Yes, and we all know what a struggle it is to get Diane to talk about herself.
Oh Frasier, you always could kid!
How I miss that!
Look, Diane, please, I-I really didn't mean anything by it.
I'm sorryÂ It's not that!
It's my whole life, it's ruined!
- Niles, could you please get her some water?
- Of course, of course.
Oh, everything I told you tonight is a lie.
I'm sorry for this.
- Oh, I must look just awful.
- Your cheek stopped jumping.
All right, now.
Tell me what happened.
Was it about your play?
There it goes again!
Look, would you people please just give us some privacy?
!
All right now.
From the beginning.
Well, it all started a few months ago when I lost my job.
I'd been writing for "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman".
I was on the set one day, and I was trying to show Jane Seymour the proper way to cauterize a wound with a branding iron, and I accidentally set her hair on fire.
Well, from there it was a steady slide downhill.
A two-year relationship ended.
I lost the beach house, friends stopped calling Â the one bright spot was my play in Seattle.
Well, I flew up here yesterday only to find that the backer was pulling out.
I was so distraught I found myself wandering around the city in complete despair.
It's then that like a ray of hope from heaven, I saw your smiling face on the side of a bus.
And that's why I'm here today.
You helped me the only other time I was this low.
Frasier, I'm asking for your help again.
Of course I'll help you, Diane.
- Well, that was a bit scary.
- I'll say Â watching someone go completely crackers like that.
- What's the matter with you now?
- Nothing, I'm fine.
Just suddenly missing my Maris.
INTERPLAY My God, Niles, it's such a glorious day!
I walked all the way here.
Thirty-two blocks, and Bruno Maglies be damned!
Oh yes, I see the look, I know exactly what it means too.
How could I very well say "no" to Diane?
She came to me in crisis.
Oh, excuse me, a double cappuccino, please, light cinnamon, thank you very much.
Oh, you know, the change in Diane has really been quite gratifying.
Dropped her off at the theater today, and there was a smile on her face that I haven't seen in well, far too many years.
Oh, I know what you're thinking.
Where did she get the money to do the play?
Well, she found a backer!
It's tax deductible!
Thank you.
Oh, why don't you go ahead and say what you're thinking, Niles?
That I'm falling for her again.
"Well, you did bounce in here as though you were on top of the world, and babbling about her smile" Â I just don't want to hear it, Niles!
I'm simply helping her to get back on her feet and out of my life as quickly as possible.
No, I don't know how long it's going to take.
Look, I said I don't know!
Oh, really, Niles!
Curse you, you are the most infuriating busybody!
I'm not sitting with you.
FOREPLAY It really is a lovely city.
"Night Â making all things dimly beautiful" "One veil over us both".
Cyrano?
Yes.
Eleven years later, we're still on the same page.
Frasier, these past few weeks, you've given so much of yourself to me.
I want to give the one gift I have to bestow.
I want you to be the first person to see my play.
Will you come to dress rehearsal tonight?
- Diane, I'd be honored.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful!
- Give me a second.
- Are you sure you're ready for this?
Oh yes, it's time.
Tonight, I bare myself to you.
- Big step, Diane.
- Oh well, I have to say I'm a little nervous about it.
But, barring any lighting or prop problems, the whole thing will be over in a couple of hours.
Hello!
People still in the house here!
Meet me at the theater at seven I don't know what I've done to deserve you.
Listen, it's none of my business, but you're not falling for her again, are you?
- What if I were?
- That woman dumped you at the altar.
Oh, that was the old Diane.
She no longer sees herself as the center of the universe.
And I'm not the old Frasier anymore either.
People can change, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
Take me for instance.
The old Martin would have said, "you're out of your mind.
I'd rather see you go gay and shack up with the punk who shot me than go off with her.
I'd rather see you sewed up inside the body of a dead horse".
But the new Martin just says, "Vivee a l'amour".
The new Frasier resists the temptation to correct your French.
Well, the stage is set, my players are prepared.
So, without further ado, I give you "Rhapsody and Requiem," a play by Diane Chambers.
Boy, it sure is great having Mary Anne back.
Just wasn't the same when she was gone.
Yeah, well, you know, uh, recent studies at John Hopkins University revealed that the expression "absence makes the heart grow fonder," is in actuality rooted in scientific bedrock.
Yeah, so's your head.
- Ease up there, Darla.
- Evenin', everybody.
Hey there, Ned.
What would you say to a beer?
What's a nice beer like you doing in a face like this?
- Salutations, all.
- Hey there, Doc.
What can I get you?
Ooh, a prickly choice, Stan.
It reminds me of the one the 18th-century wit John Wilkes faced when asked by the Earl of Sandwich whether he expected to die on the gallows or of the pox.
"That depends, sir," he said, "on whether I choose to embrace your principles or your mistress".
Evening, people.
I pour beer down people's throats.
I drink it.
Our lives are empty.
So what draws our feet here night after night?
Well, I'm off.
- See you anon, mi amore.
- You bet, honey.
Hold it, stop!
What kind of a kiss was that?
You two are supposed to be in love!
- Well, I didn't know how big you wanted it.
- Remember that kiss you gave me this morning?
Like this one?
That's the one.
OK, from the kiss!
You bet, honey.
Forgive me, Franklin.
I suppose that was a tad inconsiderate.
Quite all right.
A loving spirit like yours can't be bridled.
- But I did leave you at the altar.
- No, you know I hold no ill-will toward you for that.
Could we just stop for a second?
This whole getting-left-at-the-altar thing, I just don't know what I'm supposed to be feeling.
I may be able to illuminate that for you!
What you are feeling is that this woman has reached into your chest, plucked out your heart, and thrown it to her hell-hounds for a chew toy!
And it's not the last time either!
Because that's what this woman is!
She is the Devil!
There's no use running away from her, because no matter how far you go, no matter how many years you let pass, you will never be completely out of reach of those bony fingers!
So drink hearty, Franklin, and laugh!
Because you have made a pact with Beelzebub!
And her name is Mary Anne!
AFTERPLAY - I thought we should talk.
- Well, yes, I think we should.
- I tried to reach you at your home.
- I was driving around.
I'm sorry if I in any way misled you about my feelings these last few weeks.
You didn't.
I think I misled myself.
Well, at the very least I obviously owe you an apology for the first time that things went awry between us.
- Oh, it's all right.
- No, it was a time in my life when No, Diane, it isn't necessary.
The things I said well, they just needed saying.
Besides, I don't really feel all that harshly.
and in retrospect, I'm reasonably sure that yu are not the Devil although he does have the power to assume pleasing shapes.
Well, you should know I've decided to go back to Los Angeles.
Watching the play tonight through fresh eyes, I well, I just don't think it's ready.
I'm sure things'll work out fine.
Well, I think I've said what I came to say.
Frasier, um, before you go, there's one last thing you could help me with, not that you haven't helped me a lot already.
It's the last scene, where Franklin and Mary Anne say goodbye.
It's never felt quite right to me.
I'd like her to stand oh, right about here and tell him how much he's meant to her and how she'll never forget him.
How do you suppose "Franklin" would respond to that?
Well, I suppose he'd tell her that he feels the same way.
That she's touched him in a way she can never imagine and he's glad she was in his life.
All that would be left would be the "goodbye".
How do you see that?
Well, I suppose he could say, uh, "until we meet again," probably certain that they never would.
But mightn't there be a part of him that hopes they would?
Oh, I suppose so, yes.
All right, then, don't have him sum things up.
Just let them say their goodbyes, and if their paths happen to cross again, so be it - Goodbye, Mary Anne.
- Goodbye, Franklin.
Oh yes, that's a perfect moment!
Uncluttered by any extra words or phrases Oh shoot, I've blown it!
All right, let's try it again.
Goodbye, Diane.
Goodbye, Frasier.
Force of habit.
I've been doing it all week.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
You'll ruin his concentration!
He's on a stakeout to catch whoever's been pinching our newspaper.
He's been at it for over an hour!
I must say, I can see why he was such a good policeman.
Yes, very impressive, isn't he?
When he wakes up you must get him to tell you about his stint as security coordinator for Jimmy Hoffa!
Dad, come on, rise and shine.
You fell asleep.
Ah yes, I see our newspaper thief has struck again!
- Damn, he's good!
- Come on in.
This morning, for the first time since our separation, Maris actually picked up the phone and called me!
She needs a favour.
Well Niles, I think that's hardly cause to celebrate.
She called you just because she wants something?
No, no, not "wants," Frasier.
"Needs".
This is my chance to show her how necessary I really am to her, and all I have to do is fix one small problem!
- What's the problem?
- Uh, she's wanted by the police.
Apparently, she was driving past a shoe store last week, when she spotted a stunning pair of Ferragamo pumps.
Well, I need not remind you what effect a Ferragamo sighting can have on Maris's hand-eye coordination.
She drove up on the sidewalk, and when the police ran her name through the computer, they found quite a little backlog of unpaid parking tickets!
What else would you expect from a woman who thinks her chocolate allergy entitles her to park in a handicapped space?
Oh, and to top it all off she neglected to appear for her summons, and so they immediately swore out a warrant, and that brings us to you, Dad.
Why?
You were a cop.
I'm sure you still have "chums," hint-hint?
Who could lend you a hand, wink-wink?
No.
Look, you know I'd do anything for you, but not this.
All my years on the force I never even fixed a ticket, let alone an arrest warrant.
- You couldn't pull one little string?
- No, I hope everything works out for you, but I think the law should be the same for everyone.
Well, it's not.
We'd all like to believe that justice is blind, but the sad truth is, wealthy white women just can't get a fair shake!
The courts love to make examples of them.
Oh, they do.
Just think of Zsa Zsa Gabor, or Leona Helmsley.
Oh yes, two perfectly lovely women victimized by an unjust system.
Alright, fine.
If you won't help me, I'll just have to help myself.
I'm going down to that precinct house, and I'm not leaving until I get justice.
Well, not exactly justice, I suppose, more like preferential treatment, but I'm not leaving 'til I get it!
What a horrible thing to happen.
Can you picture poor Mrs. Crane confined to a jail cell?
Only if they moved the bars closer together.
THE LITTLE COMMODORE Well, that's it for today, folks!
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health!
Frasier, I feel as if I'm being sucked into a vortex of rage and despair!
Well, right back atcha!
- I take it things didn't go down so well at the station?
- The police simply would not listen to reason.
- Police?
- They're persecuting my Maris over some silly parking fines.
I felt sure they'd ease up if they understood Maris a little better, so I tried to explain her to them.
Oh, dear God.
You know, I dated a guy once who got in trouble with the cops Notice the complete absence of gasps following that statement.
Oh!
OK fine, you little weasel.
Just forget it.
I was going to help you, but Maris can just rot in the slammer.
Ooh Roz, I was joshing!
I know how you enjoy our little by-play!
That weasel line, ouch, touchÃ©!
- You know what, you're even more annoying when you grovel.
- Zing!
Got me again!
Roz, if not for his sake, then for mine, please?
OK, for you.
My friend Phil had some major traffic violations, and he was so freaked that he called this guy who, you know, fixes things.
Sounds just a tad shady, Roz.
You mean he went to some hoodlum?
Well, I wouldn't use the word "hoodlum" in front of him.
Just think of him as a guy who makes wishes come true.
Like a fairy godfather.
Another word I wouldn't use in front of him.
Here we go!
Jerome Belasco.
Oh Roz, you are an angel of mercy.
How can I repay you?
The next time you think of some witty little thing to say about my sex life, or what I'm wearing, just keep it to yourself.
Consider it done.
- Give me that!
- No, give me that!
Are you mad?
I will not have you turning a minor, albeit annoying situation into a, a Martin Scorsese film!
You don't understand what this means to me.
When Maris asked me for this favour, do you know what she said?
She said, "Niles, will you be my Commodore"?
- Her Commodore?
- That's what she used to call her father.
- Frasier, there was no problem so great that that man couldn't fix it.
- I'm sure.
Remember that lovely jeweled crucifix Maris picked up on her first communion trip to Rome?
Who do you think smoothed things over with the Vatican?
Yes, whatever happened to the days when a parent would take a wayward child by the hand, march them back to the scene of the crime and make them say, "I'm sorry, Your Holiness, it'll never happen again"?
You don't understand.
If I show Maris that I can step into the Commodore's plimsolls, she'll have a whole new respect for me.
We can rebuild our marriage on a healthier foundation.
Frasier, please.
Thank you.
I just know this man is the answer to my problems.
Yes, who better to mend the fragile fabric of a troubled marriage than a man whose business address is a wharf!
A WORD TO THE WISEGUY - Niles, look.
This is ridiculous, it's past midnight.
I'm leaving.
- No, no, no, you can't leave.
You're my backup.
I wonder what's keeping him?
- Do you suppose that's him?
- I doubt it, that overcoat is Armani!
Good point, Niles.
Where would a criminal come up with the money for something like that?
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I presume?
- Oh, yes.
I'm Niles Crane, this is my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Jerome Belasco.
- Pleasure.
Excuse my tardiness, but my lady friend and I were having one of those discussions from which it is difficult to remove oneself.
- Yes, we certainly know about those, don't we?
- Yes, dames!
So you have some problem you think I can help you with?
Well, I do.
Please, Jerome.
Well, you see, last week my lady got on the wrong side of "Larry Law," and since then certain, shall we say, "complications" have arisen, and in brief, things have got "hot-hot-hot," and we believe you are the man to "turn on the air conditionin'".
I sense you're a film buff, Dr. Crane.
- Just show him the charges, Niles.
- Yes, here we are.
Quite a few.
"Ignoring a summons, speeding, reckless endangerment".
- Your wife sounds like a very carefree lady..
- Oh, yes.
She's ounces of fun.
Do you think you could persuade the police to show some leniency?
Well, there's never any harm in making a phone call.
Excuse me.
Thank you!
Yes, around and straight to the back.
He's making the call!
He's making the call!
Frasier, you're going to think I'm mad for saying this, but that was fun!
Well, I must admit, Niles, it is not entirely unpleasant to rub shoulders with the demi-monde.
I definitely felt a real testosterone surge, you know?
Me too, me too!
It's like an actual tingling in my chest.
And now it's gone there it is again!
and now it's gone.
Oh, Niles, it must be your cellular phone vibrating.
Oh, it is!
You're right.
Hello?
Oh hello, Maris!
Yes, I'm tending to that very matter right now.
Oh, just wait a second.
- Well?
- You may consider the matter dealt with.
Maris, it's all taken care of What did you say?
No, I've just never heard those words before.
You're welcome.
Oh Jerome, thank you!
Now, if you'll excuse me gentlemen, I've got another business engagement.
At this hour of the night?
My God, it's past midnight.
What kind of business could it possibly be of mine where you're going?
!
- Tell me, what do I owe you?
- Oh, nothing.
- I was happy I could help.
- Oh, don't be silly.
I insist!
Consider it a favor.
I was in a position to help you.
Perhaps someday you'll be in a position to help me.
Oh, I would love that.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, just say the word.
- You're very kind.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.
- And you.
And I meant that!
Anything at all, you just let me know!
I shouldn't have said that, should I?
DOESN'T EVERYONE HAVE POI RAMEKINS?
Jerome!
Look Niles, it's Jerome!
In my house!
We've been having the most delightful chat.
Dr. Crane, you're a lucky young man to have such a charming young woman in your employ.
Oh, go on.
Did you know his brother supplied the cement for this very building?
- What a small world, oh look at the time!
- So Jerome, you didn't tell us what line of work you're in.
Oh wait, let me guess!
I'm a bit psychic.
Let's see you're some sort of doctor.
An osteopath, perhaps?
- No.
- Well that's odd.
I can see you hovering over people with broken bones.
Boys, why don't you help me get some refreshments for your new friend?
- Who the hell is this guy?
- He's some hooligan who helped fix Maris's legal problem, and in return I promised him a favour.
Oh God, do you think that's why he's here?
To collect?
No, Niles.
He's probably having a luau and he came to borrow our Poi Ramekins!
Are you guys nuts?
You don't get involved with somebody like that!
Wait, before we panic, we should at least talk to him.
You know, get the "straight dope".
Also known as "the skinny".
Knock it off, Bugsy!
Stealing newspapers is most un-neighborly behavior.
If you would like I could find out who's doing it, and make sure they never even think Oh no!
No!
That's fine!
So Jerome, is there something we can do for you?
Since you ask, you may recall the other evening I mentioned my lady friend?
If I may Oh!
She's a pretty thing, isn't she!
This is at the dog track where we met.
And here's our first Sinatra concert.
And this was at the funeral of a business associate.
You know, for the life of me, I can't recall ever having seen a woman wearing so many different kinds of furs all at the same time.
- Well, Brandy is a uniquely stylish woman.
- Brandy?
Yeah, the traditional spelling.
We've been engaged for eight years, but she refuses to set a wedding date.
This upsets me.
It also upsets my mother, whose comments on the subject are frequent and vivid.
So where do these two come in?
Well, if she's reluctant to marry me, obviously she needs therapy.
Well, you're in luck!
Niles happens to be one of the finest marriage counselors in all of Seattle!
Well actually, Dr. Crane, I would prefer it if Brandy spoke to you.
- To me?
- No offense to you, Dr. Crane.
Oh, none taken!
She's a great fan of your show.
I'm sure she'd heed any advice that you might care to offer.
Such as "Marry him.
Promptly".
But I'm not here to put words into your mouth.
You'll know what to say.
Jerome, you know I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm used to rendering my opinion, not being a mouthpiece for someone else.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.
Dr. Crane, there are some times in life we must do unpleasant things.
I'd hate to tell you some of the unpleasant things I've had to do.
I see.
Well then,..
why don't you just give Brandy my unlisted home number, which I'm sure you came across when you were finding out where I lived.
- I'll be glad to chat with her.
- Thank you.
She'll be in touch.
And I hope that one day you'll dance at my wedding.
If I'm able to dance.
If you ask me, you're getting off easy.
He could have asked you for a much bigger favour.
Dad, how can I possibly as a self-respecting psychiatrist tell any woman to marry that thug?
What are you talking about?
He seemed very nice to me.
This coming from the psychic who thought he was a chiropractor!
Listen, I've heard your show.
One more piece of half-assed advice isn't going to kill you.
- Jerome, on the other hand - Okay, dad!
The key to lasting weight-loss is to change the way you view food everyday.
You can't go on through life binging and then starving yourself for two weeks just to fit into that gorgeous new evening gown you've bought for a special occasion.
- Can you understand that?
- Yeah.
Thanks Doc.
Don't mention it, Steve.
Roz, who's our next caller?
We have Randy, from Richmond Beach.
- Hello Randy, I'm listening.
- Not Randy, Brandy.
The traditional spelling.
You know we're all out of time, my goodness I feel so sorry but - No, you're not.
We've got five minutes left!
- Thank you, Roz!
Alright Brandy, go ahead.
Your problem, please.
It's my boyfriend, Jerome.
He said I should call you.
We've been semi-engaged for eight years, and he wants to get married.
Well, I can certainly hear the love in your voice, so I say case closed, best of luck to you in the future!
Whoa!
You got a bus to catch?
!
There's a lot more to it.
For starters I think he's cheated on me.
Well, in my experience, if you suspect something like that, nine out of ten times you're right.
Well, I think a little mistrust adds mystery to a relationship.
Mystery I could stand if he didn't neglect me so much.
Every time we go for a romantic dinner, he gets a phone call and bang, it's "Gotta work babe, finish your lobster.
I'll send you a limo".
Lobster?
Limos?
My God, give me his number and I'll marry him!
Money ain't everything, especially when you've got a sex life like ours - He's not even good in bed?
- Who knows?
We're never there long enough to find out!
You know, this really isnÂt necessary I said to him last night, "What the hell was that?
!
I've been vaccinated slower"!
Well, that just leaves more time to cuddle!
- Can I say something?
- No!
Look, I could deal with the other problems, if it weren't for one thing.
All my life I've dreamed of being a career woman, but he says I'm not allowed to work!
I'm supposed to sit home all day, let him take care of me.
So, what do you think, Doc?
Should I marry him?
Well taking into account the years you've invested in the relationship, and Jerome's obvious love for you, not to mention his generosity Tell me what you think, Dr. Crane, 'cause I really, really respect you.
Brandy run!
Save yourself.
Do not marry this man.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, saying goodbye, and see you, God willing, tomorrow.
Yes, I'll have a non-fat, decaf latte, please.
Oh, what the hell?
Look, make it a full-fat mocha with extra whipped cream.
What the hell, put a slice of bacon on it!
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles!
Don't do that!
- Sorry.
Double espresso, please.
I heard you on the radio today.
I thought what you did was noble.
To what South American nation will you be fleeing?
Oh, like I'd tell you.
One minute of interrogation, and you would crack like a Jordan almond!
Frasier, I never meant for any of this to happen.
How long are you going to stay mad at me?
For as long as I live.
Which'll probably take us through breakfast.
Oh, wrong again!
Oh, oh look!
It's Jerome Belasco!
Jerome, take a seat!
Look Frasier, it's our friend, JEROME BELASCO.
I heard your broadcast this afternoon.
It displeased me.
Yeah, let me have a little hot milk, please.
When I'm displeased I get acid in my stomach, Dr. Crane.
Believe me, the last thing I wanted to do is displease you.
Or to hear the words "acid" and "Dr. Crane" in the same sentence.
But - Jerome, I'm sorry - how could I have advised her otherwise?
She said that you cheated on her.
She said she suspected me!
I've never cheated on Miss Brandy.
Alright, be that as it may, how can I advise her to marry a man who's so controlling that he won't even allow her to work?
It may interest you to know that over the years I've called in favors to get Miss Brandy fourteen jobs!
She lost all of them.
- So you're saying she's had trouble finding her niche?
- No, I'm saying she's a dodo.
Now you may love a dodo; you may think the dodo is beautiful; you may even wish to marry the dodo.
But you do not encourage a dodo to fly!
Now, when she loses these jobs it makes her very unhappy.
So, for her sake I said, "No more jobs".
But now, in order to convince her to marry me, I've had to reverse this policy.
- So she has agreed to marry you?
- If I get her a job.
And not just any job.
A job that she can never lose.
A job where if she burns the place down, they will apologise to her for having made it so flammable.
Well, good luck finding someone who'll hire her.
Dr. Crane, your brother called.
The court time for your tennis game is 11 o'clock.
Oh, good Lord.
I distinctly told him I wasn't available until noon.
Hey, if you're going to call him back, put it on the speakerphone.
- Don't you think this is getting a little old?
- Well I think it's just mean, is what I think.
So sue me, I enjoy it.
Good morning!
Niles Crane, psy-kee-at-trist.
Yes, is Dr. Crane there?
This is his brother, Frasier.
Oh hi, Dr. Crane.
It's me, Brandy.
Hang on, I'm getting another call.
I'll just put you on hold.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, Daphne!
You seen Eddie?
No, I haven't.
It just doesn't feel right to start the day without him licking me awake.
Well, don't look at me.
Morning, all.
Daphne, I got treats!
What the hell are you doing with him?
We went for a walk.
I'm talking to Eddie.
When I saw what a beautiful day it was, I headed for the park.
Of course, the only people in the park at this hour of the morning without dogs are winos and that guy in the harem pants that washes his hair in the fountain.
He says hello, by the way.
It is sort of nice out, isn't it?
Sort of nice?
My God, haven't you people noticed this?
It's incredible!
Dad, you should feel this.
It's eighty degrees outside and it's the middle of February!
Oh, it is beautiful, and in the middle of such a terrible winter.
Oh, I love nature's little aberrations: warm days in winter, four leaf clovers, Australians Yes, it is glorious.
It defies you not to takea moment to acknowledge the power that created it.
Thank you, global warming!
Hey Frasier, think your guy down at the liquor store could send a bottle of Scotch to my buddy Jimmy in Montana?
Sure, Dad.
What's the occasion?
Today's his sixteenth birthday.
Oh well, you'll want to throw in a hooker too, won't you?
No, don't you get it?
It's February 29th.
Hmm.
It's a leap year.
Right.
He only gets a birthday every four years.
I get it dad.
He's really sixty-four.
I can do the math.
Jimmy's having a big shindig tonight.
A lot of guys from the force fly in for it.
Everybody drinks a lot of beer, and then they have a contest to see who's got the biggest scar.
You know, this year I had a real good chance of winning it now that "Shark Bait" O'Reilly's finally died.
So, why aren't you going?
Yeah Dad, you should go.
Ah, Montana's too far away.
Well Dad, his birthday only comes around once every four years.
As a matter of fact, this day only comes around every four years.
You know, it's like a free day, a gift.
We should do something special, be bold!
It's leap year, take a leap!
You know, I was just about to say the same thing to you.
Your son's right.
You shouldn't be afraid to shake up your routine a little bit.
Hey, I don't see you taking any big leaps today.
If there was something I wanted to do, I would do it.
Well, you're always whining about wanting to change your hair.
I don't whine!
"I'm so sick of me hair.
Do you think I should get it cut like Princess Di?
Ooh, do you think that'd make me cheeks look too fat?
That reminds me of the craziest thing me Grammy Moon used to say"!
I'll pay for the damn haircut if you stop yakking and just do it.
Yes, well I'll pay for you to go to Montana.
That's not the one next to New Hampshire, is it?
No.
And Dad can pay for his own trip.
All right, then.
And I can pay for me own haircut.
All right, Dad, back in your court.
Are you up to the leap year challenge?
Ah..
Dad, Jimmy's already sixteen.
How many more birthdays is he going to have?
You know, I would kind of hate not being there when Jimmy brings out the big ham.
Oh, all right, what the hell, I'll go.
I'll call the airlines after breakfast.
That's the spirit!
Hey, what's your big leap year challenge?
Well, have you forgotten?
I'm singing "Buttons and Bows" tonight at the P.B.S. pledge drive.
You sung that same stupid song for the last three years.
Yes, but I'm doing something remarkably fresh and different with it this year!
You're just blowing smoke, aren't you?
Like a '56 Rambler!
Good morning, Niles!
Good?
It's glorious, heaven-sent!
And you know why?
Maris called!
She wants to get together with me this evening.
Oh Niles, that's wonderful news!
It's high time you and Maris sat down and talked through your problems.
She doesn't want to talk.
When she says "get together" she means in the "You wear the creme fraiche, I'll lick it off" sense.
She's cleared her schedule from 19:00 till 19:30, that means foreplay AND cuddling!
You know, Niles, remember when you were a kid and your mother and I wouldn't discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis in front of you because we knew it'd give you bad dreams?
Yes.
It's a two-way street.
Breakfast, Dr. Crane?
Uh yes, thank you, Daphne.
Niles, I don't mind telling you, I'm a little bit concerned about this.
Maris claps her hands, you come running?
Oh well, don't forget there's a little something for me in this too.
I haven't had sex in six months.
Oh, surely you're exaggerating, you've only been separated for three.
And your point would be?
You really want to sacrifice your self-respect for a roll in the hay?
Substitute a 16th-century giltwood fainting couch for hay and watch me roll!
Niles, you and Maris have not sat down and discussed your problems.
As a psychiatrist you know that sex will only cloud the issues.
You don't realize how desperate I am.
Ever since our separation, I've been paying women to touch me.
Oh, Niles Manicurists, pedicurists, facialists.
Whenever you see a man who's well-groomed, you can bet he's not getting any.
Well, will you at least think about what I've said?
I can't.
She's leaving for Europe in the morning, so I have a very small window of opportunity.
Niles you know I'm right.
You just don't want me to have sex because you're not having any!
I most certainly am too!
Your lips say yes, but your cuticles speak volumes.
Niles Oh, you're right.
I'll tell her no.
It's not going to be easy, though.
Of course not.
Just don't think about sex.
Would you like me to butter your buns for you, Dr. Crane?
Grandma in a teddy.
Thank you.
You're all mine in buttons and bows!
Oh God, it must be P.B.S. pledge time again.
Roz, it is a wonderful day.
You know, I think the entire city of Seattle is convinced it's springtime.
I was walking down the street, I passed a pet store, and in the window I could see two snakes doing a mating dance.
If you ask me, celebrating a dance that brings more snakes into the world is like toasting a law school graduation.
Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done nothing to improve your mood.
Well, how would you feel if you just lost the love of your life?
Well, alimony aside, I found it rather liberating.
My car wouldn't start, so I had to take the bus.
And we're all crowded on there, when suddenly I smell Lagerfeld, and I I look up, and there he is.
Carl Lagerfeld?
His name is Gary.
I don't know his last name.
Anyway, we got to talking, and you know, we were really connecting.
I started to believe in kismet.
And all of a sudden, all these people want to get off the bus, and I'm in their way, so I get off to let them out, and before I can get back on, the damn bus drives off!
Out of my life, forever.
I'm sure another one would have come along in ten minutes or so.
I'm talking about the guy.
So am I. You don't get it, Frasier.
I mean, I really felt this guy was the one.
Roz, if you really want to try to find him again, you know we do reach half a million listeners.
Why don't you just tell your story on the air?
On the air?
Oh, I couldn't do that, it would make me look pathetic.
Oh, it's too bizarre, it's too needy.
It's two o'clock.
Oh my God!
A glorious good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
I'm thinking a lot today about leap year.
Today is February 29th, and although it isn't an official holiday, perhaps it could be looked upon as one in a metaphorical sense.
Just as Christmas reminds us to be generous of spirit, so leap year reminds us to take a leap in our own lives.
To be bold, try something new.
Too often we shrink from doing things we really want to, held back by oh, appearing foolish, perhaps Roz?
Is there anything you'd like to say before we start taking calls?
No.
I'm reminded of a quotation by John Greenleaf Whittier: "For all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: "It might have been" Roz?
No.
Did you know that a woman over the age of thirty has less chance of getting married than of being killed in a terrorist attack?
This is to Gary.
I was on the Number Seven bus around noon, and you were a stockbroker with a tan briefcase and a cleft chin, and the bus was really crowded and we both reached for the hand strap and our hands touched and we laughed and you said I had a really great laugh and I said you had a really great laugh and we laughed at that Anyway, uh, you asked me if I were free on Friday, but we got separated before I could give you my phone number, which I would have because I really liked you and I thought you were cute.
So Gary, if you're listening, please, please give us a call.
We'll be right back after these words.
Oh my God, oh my God!
How could I say "I really liked you and I thought you were cute"..
who am I, Marcia Brady?
!
Well, we'll be right back for more calls, and more on the search for Gary, after this news break.
Good news!
I've figured out a way I can have sex and we can all be happy!
As I pause to make sure the "ON AIR" light is off, continue.
Well, I was driving down the freeway trying hard not to notice the provocative decals truckers have on their mud flaps when I heard your little speech about breaking out of familiar patterns.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, sleeping alone has been my pattern!
I'm ready to take a leap!
No, you're not.
Okay, not a leap, but you've got to give me something.
A hop, a bound.
Gimme a jump, oh God-!
Niles, will you just get a grip!
If you thought being with Maris was the right thing to do, you'd be there with her.
You know it's wrong.
That's why you're here, asking for my permission.
Frasier, Frasier, what if we don't have sex?
What if we just snuggle?
Whoops, excuse me!
RozI never noticed what a perky little walk you have.
Niles, get back!
You just stop that!
Niles Get control.
My God, man, there are far more important things here than simple immediate physical gratification.
You're right, II just have to martial my self-discipline andand be strong.
Fifteen seconds.
Oh.
What is wrong with your brother today?
Oh, ignore him.
You know, human nature never ceases to amaze me.
How otherwise rational people can be turned into babbling ninnies by their hormones.
OH MY GOD!
IT'S GARY!
OH MY GOD!
IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM!
Well, we're back.
You'll all be glad to know that Cupid's arrow has hit its mark.
Gary has just arrived in the hallway, and has a big bouquet of flowers for Roz.
You know, the truth is, I'm really quite delighted with the way things have turned out today.
It inspires me to take a little leap of my own.
As many of you know, this evening, for the third year in a row I will be appearing on the P.B.S. pledge drive You know, I was getting a little nervous, the way you were describing me on the air.
Why?
Well, my wife listens to the show.
You're married?
Yeah, but it's okay.
I still want to go out with you.
So, instead of Buttons and Bows,?
I have chosen to sing a very challenging aria from Verdi's Rigoletto - something I have never attempted outside the shower.
I certainly hope my little gamble turns out as well as Roz's has.
Or even better.
Oh, God!
Well, perhaps they'll pledge to get you to stop singing.
Oh, and by the way, thanks so much for the cold shower tip.
Did it work?
No, it did not.
It's clearly an old wives tail, because I'm still thinking of my old wife's tail.
Yes, well I suppose it stood to reason being showered with coldness would only bring Maris more to mind.
Keep making remarks like that, I won't help you rehearse.
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.
It's just that I'm awfully nervous.
You know, as much as I admire your willingness to take a leap, I did warn you that you were getting into a dangerous aria.
?
Oh God, I'm using humor to mask sexual frustration.
It's high school all over again.
Look Niles, I know it's difficult, but Maris has got to learn that you're not just someone who can be ordered to perform at will.
Now sit, play!
Next time it looks like IÂm going to follow a piece of your advice, shoot me in the head first!
Dad!
Why aren't you in Montana?
Fifteen minutes out, a flock of Canadian geese flew into one of our engines.
They were the lucky ones!
Next thing you know, we're falling five thousand feet.
Smokehouse almonds are flying everywhere, people arescreaming and hugging each other.
The guy in the next seat grabbed hold of my hand, and you know what?
I didn't pull it away!
Then our pilot comes out.
Our landing gear's out, we're gonna have to do an emergency belly landing in six feet of foam!
So, five hellish minutes later, we're bouncing across the runway.
Then the stewardess comes out and says we're gonna have to go down the emergency slide.
So down I go, headfirst into this sea of foam.
Last thing I remember, this fat lady rom across the aisle comes barreling down the chute after me like a polyester avalanche!
My God, Dad, I am so sorry.
So-so, these stewardesses, were they also covered with foam?
Will you stop it!
Dad, if you'd like to talk about it, we're both here for you.
Boy, I tell you, times like this, you just all you can think of is your loved ones, and how you wish you'd spent more time with them.
Eddie!
Well, let's get back to work.
Mmm-hmm.
I need something to take my mind off the fact that at this very moment, Maris is slipping out of her frilly under-things and into a non-fat milk bath.
Is something wrong?
Yes, somethingÂs wrong.
Things turned out so badly for Roz and Dad today, I'm just wondering if my little leap is ill-advised.
Oh, now Maybe this aria thing won't turn out so well, either.
Just because theirs went wrong doesn't mean yours will, too.
Yeah They're two isolated incidents.
All right.
Oh, will these infernal temptations never end?
!
Oh, tell me the truth.
Is it as bad as I think it is?
How bad do you think it is?
Take a leap!
Mr. Maurice hair-designer!
Trust me!
Children pointing!
Your fault!
Okay, that's it.
I can't take it anymore, I'm leaving.
No, Niles!
You can't leave me now, I need you more now than ever.
Oh, give it up.
No one who's followed your little Take a leap philosophy has ended up even remotely better.
I don't care what you're saying, I'm going to Maris.
You will rue the day!
I don't care!
Niles gotta have it!
Oh, Pete.
Hi, Doc.
I hear you're doing something new this year.
Whoa!
What, is it too hard for you?
Me?
No, I'm-I'm worried about you.
I can hit any note.
See?
No, Lamb Chop's not here.
Big Bird isn't here either.
What are you doing up so late?
Oh.
Do you have your mommy's credit card handy?
Have your mommy call us back later, bye-bye.
Well, I guess your little aria must be coming up soon.
Yeah - along with some Veal Milanese and a rather disappointing Chardonnay.
Oh, Roz, I hope you're not still angry with me for the way my advice backfired today?
Oh no, not at all!
In fact, I've been meaning to tell you how much I admire you for what you're doing tonight.
After watching me crash and burn like that, you're going to go out and sing this very difficult song in a foreign language under these unflattering lights, with your clothes soaked with sweat, on live television How long are you going to stay mad at me?
Until the day I get married.
Yo, Doc, Doc!
Please, please, I've been going over your music, and when we get to this section here, either I can play really loud, or jab you with a pin, because between you and me, you're not hitting this note without a pole vault.
Ten seconds, Dr. Crane.
That's it!
That's it!
I'm not doing the aria!
What?
You're backing out after you made all of us take those stupid leaps?
You bet I am!
It may be an unwise man who doesn't learn from his own mistakes, but it's an absolute idiot that doesn't learn from other people!
But you promised all your listeners!
Oh, what's the difference?
!
Who watches P.B.S.?
!
I'll tell you who: discerning, cultured viewers, like yourselves.
Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
And like yourselves, I care about quality programming, such as foreign films, classical music, opera ?
which is why I intended to sing a rather challenging piece: an aria from Verdi's Rigoletto.
But, who am I to ignore the dozens of phone calls that have come in requesting my signature piece, a rather charming little ditty that I first sang three years ago on Classic Western Movie Week.
So without further ado, I give you Buttons and Bows,?
from Paleface.
Maestro, please?
East is East, and West is West And the wrong one I have chose Let's go where you keep on wearing those- Da da dahs, and boppa dohs, Things and buttons, buttons and bows!
Don't bury me, uh ?
lovely pea, Something, la-la-la!
Let's all go to a taco show, and and a how I love, such and thrush, blow my nose, You look great in buttons and bows!
I love you in buckskin, la da-da da-da daaaa!
Everybody!
My bones denounce, the fearful trounce, and la-la la-la Moldic rose!
Ba-da Seuss, a palm caboose!
and a panda hop, and pantyhose You look buppity, buttons and bows!
Oh, I bet this is one leap year Dr. Crane won't be sorry to see the back of!
Should we rewind it, so we can watch it again?
No, no, not yet, let it finish first, this is the verse where he REALLY loses it!
Bippity-boppity, hippity-dos Something and something, and buttons and bows!
Okay, now you can rewind it!
Hey!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Well, it's uh 2:07, here on the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.
As I said, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer, filling in for the temporarily detained Dr. Crane.
It's cloudy and 62 degrees outside coming up on 2:08 right there.
Well, let's take a call.
Hello, Lydia.
What seems to be the problem?
I already told you.
Yeah, that was when I was the call screener, now I'm the host.
So, tell me your problem, and take your time.
Well, it started about two weeks ago.
I got this terrible obscene phone call.
It's happened several times since then and now it's to the point where I'm afraid to answer my own phone.
Well, obscene phone calls can be very disturbing.
But luckily, Dr. Frasier Crane has just arrived and I'm sure he knows exactly what soothing things to say.
Maybe now would be a good time to take a break.
We'll be right back after this.
What the hell was that all about?
!
Oh, never mind that, where were you?
Oh, god.
Somebody'd parked in my space again.
I had to park six blocks from here and sprint the whole way.
By the end, my tweed pants were throwing off so many sparks I almost caught myself on fire!
I tell you what - the minute we go to a news break I'm going to rush down there and put this withering note on his windshield.
Dear discourteous driver?
Whoa!
I think you've said enough right there!
Come on, Frasier.
This isn't gonna do any good!
You want to make an impression on him?
Get tough.
You go right down there and let the air out of his tires.
Oh, I wouldn't do something like that.
Why?
It's just inconveniencing him like he inconvenienced you.
Roz, listen, the world has become uncivilized enough without me stooping to that level.
Of course I was sorely tempted last night.
I went to the movies to see "How Green Was My Valley".
Lady Luck seated me in front of two elderly women who said with the arrival of each new actor, "My God, doesn't he look young; he's dead, you know".
Finally I had to just walk out.
Oh, you're on in five seconds.
And Brenda is on line one.
Hello, Seattle.
We're back, and I would like to start by apologizing for being tardy.
Nothing quite so inconsiderate as making someone wait.
Now without further ado let's get to Brenda.
Hello, Brenda.
Hi, Dr. Crane.
I'm having a problem with my sister.
She's always Oh, wait a second.
That's my other line.
Something tells me I'm going to be siding with Brenda's sister.
You're welcome!
Excuse me, I was wondering if you could direct me to Friendly Video.
Yeah, I think we got that one.
Hang on a second, I'll check.
Don't you hate that?
You come all the way down here yourself to the store, wait patiently, and somebody who calls in from home gets preferential treatment.
I can help the next person in line.
Hey, do we have "The Invisible Man"?
Right here!
Thanks.
Yeah, we got it.
Excuse me.
I was looking for Don't even think about it!
I'm looking for "How Green Was My Valley".
Huh?
It is a beautifully acted depiction of life in a small town in Wales.
It won five Academy Awards!
It's a classic!
Oh.
Well, uh, this is a shot in the dark, but you might try looking in the Classics section.
Uh you're taking "How Green Was My Valley"?
I heard it was great.
Yes, but you heard it from me!
You were standing next to me in the line!
Excuse me, is there another copy?
Oh yeah, that would be across the street in our "How Green Was My Valley" annex.
Hey Daphne.
Come on, you're just in time.
It's starting.
I don't get this show.
People send in videos of themselves having the most embarrassing and painful accidents.
They add cartoon noises and music and everyone laughs themselves silly.
Boy, I bet that hurt!
Well, what's wrong with you?
Frankly, I have had it with the whole boorish, ill-mannered world.
Look, Dad, would you mind terribly if I used the TV tonight?
I went to three video stores to get this tape.
I'm just dying to see it.
Sure, go ahead.
How many times can you watch a dog get hit with a swinging door?
Depends upon the dog.
What the hell is that?
!
The windows are rattling, the walls are shaking, and I am talking to no one!
!
Well, I see our neighbor's at it again.
Not for long!
I'm gonna take a nap.
Frasier: Dad, you can't possibly expect to sleep in this racket.
Are you kidding?
I've slept through worse than this.
In Korea I dropped off in a foxhole right outside P'Anmunjom.
By the time I woke up the cease-fire was over and I was the only one who didn't know about it.
Talk about having egg on your face.
Yes.
Yes, would you please connect me with the young man who's just moved into the penthouse upstairs.
No, I don't know his name!
He's in the penthouse!
He has shaggy hair, tattoos all over him, his body is pierced.
Oh, and I don't know if I mentioned this but he's in the penthouse!
Never mind.
Has the world completely lost the concept of common courtesy?
Am I the only one who is resisting this tide?
!
People of Seattle, listen to me!
We are not barbarians!
We are not Neanderthals and we are not French!
Do you hear that, you up there?
!
[ That's his own music he's listening to, you know.
His name is Freddie Chainsaw.
Chainsaw?
Of the Newport Chainsaws?
How does an arrested adolescent who barely knows two chords get a penthouse?
His last album sold five million copies.
Oh.
Well, then, I'll just add that to my list of reasons to die.
You know, personally, I like it.
But then, we Brits have always been on the cutting edge.
You should have heard the punk rockers who rented the flat below me a few years back.
They'd play the same song over and over again Flesh is burning nana nana nana.
Flesh is burning nana nana nana.
Oh no.
I'm gonna have that tune in me head all day now.
Yes, well, thank you for that, Daphne.
But I've been waiting all day to watch my movie.
Doesn't he ever stop for sex and drugs?
!
Hello.
Yes.
Please, I insist on being connected with the young man in the penthouse.
Yes, hello, Mr. Chainsaw?
Yes, how do you do?
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
I am your neighbor; I live right below you.
Yes, do you have any idea how loud your music is?
Oh.
You do?
Well thank you.
I'm going out!
What?
I'm going out!
What?
I AM GOING OUT!
Hey, Frasier, will you keep it down out there.
I'm trying to take a nap!
Smell me, Niles.
Grandpa!
Exactly!
On my way down in the elevator today a woman thinks nothing of lighting up a cigarette.
Has the world gone mad?
I know exactly how you feel.
This morning I discovered a ding in the door of my car.
Let me guess - no note on the windshield?
No.
And even worse, after I'd left the car off at the body shop, the rental agency didn't have a single luxury car left.
They stuck me with some vehicle I believe they call a Hunchback.
No.
I think that would be a Hatchback, Niles.
It's painted panic-button red, with a large rear window that pops open.
Oh, that would be the Hatchback.
Well, there's a novel idea: name the car after its most hideous feature.
I presume it was a toss-up between "Hatchback" and "What's that odor coming from the floor"?
Oh, look, Niles - free table!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, the biscotti!
Leave it!
Oh, no - go on without me!
Oh, there!
Oh!
Oh, check on table one!
All right, fine.
Oh, we're not hovering, believe me.
It's just that there well, there's really no place else to stand.
Oh, just take your time, please.
There's no rush.
Is the owner of a red Hatchback here?
It's about to be towed.
Niles, isn't that your car?
Shh!
Someone will hear you!
Niles, it's about to be towed!
I'm not owning up to that car.
I don't care if it's careening toward a baby carriage!
Oh.
Oh, thank you so much.
Take care, have a lovely day.
Excuse me, but we were waiting for this table.
So get another one.
Well, there aren't any.
Look, you knew that we were waiting for it.
We politely stood back and let those people leave and then you just jumped right in here!
Well, you won't make that mistake again.
Frasier, Frasier forget it.
We'll just we'll wait for another table.
No, we won't!
This isn't about the table anymore!
This is about the erosion of common decency.
Sir, when you treat me this way you encourage me to be discourteous to another.
And so on and so on.
You don't have any manners, do you?
Then perhaps what you need is an etiquette lesson!
!
SIT DOWN, NILES!
My brother will have a decaf.
Flesh is burning, nana nana nana Nana nana nana flesh is burning nana nana nana Oh, hi, Fras.
How you feeling?
Fine.
I didn't ask you yesterday how your day went.
What did Niles tell you?
Nothing!
Geez, can't I ask you how your day went?
How was work?
How's your bad-ass self?
Dammit!
Niles blabbed!
No, he didn't.
You made the people of Seattle column.
Right here, under "The Crane Mutiny".
"Three cheers for Dr. Frasier Crane, who struck a blow against rudeness yesterday in a coffeehouse melee".
Perfect!
Now all of Seattle knows about my loutish behavior!
What are you talking about?
This guy had it coming.
I can just picture it.
He probably looked at you and he thought, "This guy's a creampuff, you know.
A wuss a wimp a cupcake" Dad!
I'm sorry, I'm just so proud of you!
Ah, there he is, the man who floats like a lepidoptera and stings like a hymenoptera.
Niles, I think you're just jealous.
Jealous?
Don't be ridiculous!
This is my favorite part.
"With one swift move the good doctor hoisted the miscreant out on his ear, declaring, 'What you need is an etiquette lesson.
'" I love that!
You got your own tough-guy catchphrase!
It's perfect for you, Frasier.
Dirty Harry meets Emily Post.
Come on.
Show me how you grabbed him.
Use Niles.
No, no Dad.
I will not toss Niles about the room.
Oh no, go ahead.
Rough me up, Mr. Big Hero Bully Bouncer!
Did that sound jealous?
A tad.
Well, all right, I'm jealous.
Why shouldn't I be?
All my life I've backed out of fights and watching you leap into the fray like that, I it made me think just once I'd like to experience what you felt - go nose to nose.
Oh, your day will come, son.
I don't know.
I tried it this morning with my dry cleaner, Mr. Kim.
I decided to give him a good tongue-lashing because he'd shattered the mother-of-pearl buttons on my best waistcoat.
Unfortunately, due to his tenuous grasp of English and the fact that his mother's name is Pearl I was forced to flee his establishment amid a shower of coat hangers.
Good morning, Dr. Crane.
And to you, Dr. Crane, our very own knight in shining armor Oh, great.
I want you to know that your assertiveness inspired me.
For weeks now, some louse has been removing my wet clothes from the washer and leaving them on the table in a soggy mess.
This morning, I decided to get my revenge.
So I took off my new red panties and I popped them in with his whites.
Bravo, Daphne.
Good for you.
God, I wish I'd been there.
Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit?
Absolutely not.
Those were my panties and I wasn't afraid to use them.
Fras, why do you keep backing away from this?
I mean, you should be proud of yourself.
We all think you did the right thing.
The newspaper does too.
That's right.
And I'm going to fix you a proper hero's breakfast.
No.
No, no Daphne.
Please, really.
It's not necessary.
Thank you all.
It's just that this isn't sitting well with me.
I find it hard to believe any good can come of violence.
That's it again!
Mr. Chainsaw.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane Go ahead, Daphne.
Make my eggs.
You know, I do wish people would stop making such a fuss.
They will, if you quit walking up and down the hall.
You're on in five seconds.
Oh yes, all right.
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
Who's on the line, Roz?
We have Mitch on line three.
He's having trouble with his neighbors.
Hello, Mitch.
Make that had trouble.
This idiot next door had his leaf-blower going at 7:00am, again.
Oh, that's very inconsiderate.
I'll say.
That's why I decided to give him an "etiquette lesson".
I grabbed that leaf-blower and smashed it against atree.
Mitch, I must say I'm stunned.
I can't imagine amore extreme response to such a minor infraction.
so I snuck into his backyard and shoved a whole pound of rotten shrimp into his air conditioner!
Come on summer!
hey, he asked for it.
So I put Look, I'm sorry, but no matter how provoked you may have been, there is no earthly justification for SETTING SOMEONE'S LAWN ON FIRE!
!
But she doesn't curb her dogs!
Oh You don't take any guff.
Why should I?
Rochelle all of you look, don't you realize that your behavior is just a bit extreme?
!
I displayed a minor bit of force in order to just make a point.
I didn't go around smashing windows or torching lawns!
Where does it end?
Are you saying that what I did was wrong?
Of course I am!
But what you did was okay?
No, no!
I come to think of it, what I did was just as wrong.
I mean, who am I to draw the line at the acceptable level of force?
Because the next person moves a little farther, and the next person, a little farther still until we finally end up with scorpions flying through the mail like Christmas bundt cakes!
What we must all agree to do is to resolve our differences with discussion and reason.
As a matter of fact, I'm going to call the gentleman that I manhandled and and apologize to him for not having worked out our dispute in the right way in the first place-through words.
The key here is restraint.
And I do hopeyou'll follow my lead Becky with the nail gun.
Oh people.
People, please.
There's no need for that.
I'm no hero.
No one's ever given me the thumbs up.
Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you.
The rest of the hand has been well-represented.
Oh, look, there he is.
Mr. Harvey, I'm so glad you could come.
You remember my brother, Niles, and uh we're at "our" table.
Look, I'm here, so say what's on your mind.
Well, there's no need for any hostility.
I just came to talk.
Talk?
You're not gonna take another shot at me?
No!
No, they'll be nothing like that here today!
Now, listen, I could try to explain my behavior by saying that these are stressful times we live in, that I had reached the end of my tether.
But I won't do that, because you see, I was 100% wrong.
I had absolutely no right to touch you and I accept full responsibility.
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.
And I hope you all heard that too.
So, then you accept my apology?
No, I'm suing you.
And I've got a lot of witnesses that just heard you admit you were wrong.
But, but these are stressful times we live in and I'd reached the end of my tether!
Tough!
I'm nailing you for assault!
But I hardly touched you!
Oh, Frasier, I'm not surprised he's hiding behind lawyers.
What other behavior would you expect from a chicken?
What did you say?
I was speaking to my brother.
But, to put it in language you can understand bawk bawk bawk bawk!
Niles!
This is no time for you to assert yourself!
Hey, your brother's making trouble here Oh, oh, oh what are you gonna do?
Flap me with one of your big fluffy wings?
Niles, stop it!
Please excuse him!
Oh, for god's sake, Frasier don't waste your breath on this hairy, knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing troglodyte who's probably the only male in existence who suffers from penis envy!
You look here, buddy Niles!
!
Niles are you all right?
!
Counter suit!
Oh, my god!
!
Nobody move him!
I barely touched him!
Then you admit you touched him!
He admits it!
Oh, Niles.
Niles, I'm here for you.
I promise we're going to get you the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY!
My god, Niles, that was brilliant.
You even got a tear in your eye!
I landed on a fork.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Are your eyes closed?
What is it?
It's something my antiques scout found for me.
Voila!
Paris, 1882!
Designed by Jean-Francois Blon, while attending L'Ecole des Beaux Arts!
Mon Dieu!
It's absolutely breathtaking!
I'm breathless!
I need to take a breath.
Evening, Dr. Crane.
Would you like to try a game, Niles?
Oh, I think not.
It'll make me too melancholy.
Well, all right.
Maris and I used to play chess every Thursday night.
Oh, how she loved the game.
No wonder ?
the king is stationary while the queen has all the power.
How are you getting along, Dr. Crane?
Oh, all right, I guess.
Feeling a bit lonely, are we?
Only some times when I'm by myself, or other times when I'm with other people.
It may not be my place to suggest this, but perhaps all you need is a little company at the apartment something warm and friendly to come home?
Well, I'm sure Dad would miss you.
Oh, Dr. Crane!
Oh, me!
I'm talking about a dog.
They're wonderful companions.
Just look at how much Eddie's brought to your father's life.
Oh, there's nothing like a dog's unconditional love.
Seeing that smiling face greet you at the door.
It's one of the most rewarding relationships a person can have.
Again?
If you're going to drink out of the toilet, you can at least learn to use it.
Would you like to come with me?
Maybe get the feel of the leash?
Perhaps I will.
You know, Daphne, maybe you're on to something with this dogbusiness.
I'm starting to feel less lonely already.
Chop, chop!
Come with us.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Did you see my new chess set?
Oh yeah, it's nice.
"Nice"?
Well, the inlay was made from the same Travertine marble they used at the Emperor Hadrian's palace outside Tivoli!
Really?
Well, I'm gonna celebrate with a beverage brewed from the crystal-clear waters of the majestic Colorado Rockies!
Good one, Dad.
Say, how about a game?
Nah, I don't think so.
Oh, come on, Dad.
You know how to play, don't you?
Well, Daphne showed me once.
But really, checkers is more my speed.
Oh, come on, checkers is a kid's game.
Come on, Dad!
I just got it!
Please?
Nobody will play with me!
All right, I'll give it another shot.
Those guys at the park make it look great eating baloney sandwiches, smoking cigars, sometimes a fist-fight even breaks out!
Well, let's just start with name-calling and see where it goes, all right?
Your turn.
Now, Dad, please, you don't have to rush.
As a novice, you have the right to sit back, survey the board, take yourtime.
I will not pressure you or hover like a vulture.
Please, feel free to ask any questions you might have.
Is this a checkmate?
Yes, it is.
You mean I won?
Well, yes.
Hey, hey!
I won!
How do you like that?
Well, in all fairness, my mind was a bit distracted by having to monitor your side of the board, but, uh Touche!
How about another game, Dad?
No, I think one'll do it for me, thanks.
Well, uh, all right, fair enough.
Boy, I really clobbered you though, didn't I?
I got almost all of your prawns.
Pawns, Dad.
I think the turning point was when I got that tower-thingy.
Yes, it's called a rook.
But the real knockout blow was when I backed your little horsey-guy into the corner.
Can we call it a night, Dad?
O.K., when I cornered your knight.
No, I mean can we call it a night?
Hey, Frasier.
Oh hi, Roz.
Uh, one double-tall latte, a slice of pecan pie with extra whipped cream.
Anything else?
Perhaps a blood-pressure cuff?
I'm just a little nervous today, O.K.?
Oh, really?
Trouble on the dating front?
I'm not that shallow, all right?
It's about my hair.
I've got an appointment this afternoon with Noge.
"Noge"?
He's the hottest hairstylist in Seattle?
"Noge"?
I think he's getting a little bored with me.
When he cuts my hair, I can't ever think of anything to say!
Well, how's this for an icebreaker: "Say, Noge, where'd you get such a stupid name"?
You should see him with all of his other clients.
They're all laughing, having a wonderful time.
I walk in, sit down, it's death.
Maybe there's something in here that'll hold his attention.
Oh, wow, here's something.
A lady in Italy gave birth to a nineteen-pound baby!
Oh my God.
No kidding.
She's not going to be hopping on her Vespa anytime soon.
That's how he did it.
What are you talking about?
My father beat me at chess last night, and I've just realized now it was sheer dumb luck.
He stumbled into the Panoph-Vinick attack!
Frasier, I?
Oh Roz, I can't tell you what a relief this is.
My God, my whole world makes sense again.
Frasier, you are forgetting about my problem with Noge.
Yes, and it'd be a lot easier if you'd stop bringing it up.
Hello, Niles.
Hello, Frasier.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, I took to heart Daphne's suggestion the other day about a need for companionship since my separation from Maris, so I went out and got a new lady in my life.
I can't explain it.
I'm not a dog person, but there's something about this particular breed that I find comforting and familiar.
It's mystifying, isn't it?
Mmm, baffling.
I-I happened into my local pet shop, and I had no intention of buying anything, I was merely browsing, and they showed me some overly demonstrative puppies.
Then I heard a haughty little sniff from a cage in the corner, and there she was!
Sit, Girl, sit!
OK.
She's, uh, she's a bit high strung, but, uh, she's terribly well-bred.
When I tried to pet her, she'd have none of it.
Well, I'm surprised she wasn't snapped up before you got there.
Yes, well, the man at the pet store said it's because people are reluctant to take responsibility for her nerve medicine.
No, not on the couch.
Off, off!
OK.
Hey, Niles.
Hey, Dad.
What the hell is that?
It's my dog, my new best friend.
Yes, Niles saw her in the pet store and had this inexplicable attraction.
You can see her ribs!
Hit Number One.
Daphne, I owe it all to you.
Oh really, Dr. Crane, I wouldn't want you going around telling people I was responsible for that.
Well, I guess we'll be toddling along.
Come Girl, come!
OK.
The city streets play havoc with her delicate little feet, so I have to go home and pumice her paw-pads!
Am I the only one?
No.
Does Dr. Crane have any idea No.
So, Dad, can I, uh, interest you in an ice-cold Ballantine?
Yeah, sounds good.
You know, I may even join you myself.
I've got some pork rinds here and some of that creamy Lipton onion soup dip!
Oh, with the seven herbs and spices?
Well, just count 'em!
Hey, that's great!
All my favorite stuff you're putting me in a home, aren't you?
Oh, don't be silly!
But you know, if I ever had to, don't you think it'd be nice if you knew how to play chess?
Dad, it's not considered a move until my fingers have completely cleared the piece.
Well, what's taking so long?
I am analyzing my options.
Unlike your "wing-it" approach, I like to plan a strategy, like a general leading his troops into battle.
Checkmate, Schwartzkopf.
Gosh, that's very well done.
You're really getting a feel for the game, Dad.
Yeah, and all this time I thought chess was hard.
Well, see ya.
Sit down, old man, you're not going anywhere!
Mr. Crane, would you give me a hand with these dishes?
I can't, I'm playing chess with Frasier.
Finally, my patience will be rewarded.
The trap is set.
I knew this moment would come!
It comes every game.
Checkmate.
Well, that's it.
Show's over, folks.
Move along.
Nothing more to see here.
You know, Dad?
No, no, I'm not playing anymore.
I'm tired and I'm going to bed.
O.K. Yes, I guess I've had my fill as well.
Well, this has really turned out to be quite a good idea, hasn't it, this chess thing?
'Night.
Awfully relaxing oh, yes, yes, you just - you just go on ahead, I-I've got - hah!
- something I've got to do Hey, Frasier!
Hi, Roz.
I have great news!
My appointment with Noge could not have gone better.
What is the reason behind this miraculous transformation?
Well, it occurred to me that hairstylists love celebrity gossip.
And I thought, "hey, I know a celebrity: you"!
And what did you tell him about me?
Well, he may have gotten the impression that you?
well, you're gonna love this ?
that, you know you may have been in the past a woman, you're not mad at me, are you?
Mad?
Why should I be mad, knowing the sacred code of silence all hairdressers have sworn to?
All right, I'll set Noge straight.
Well, if you manage that, then you really would have a story.
Well, hello.
Double cappuccino, please.
Yeah, same for me, please.
Listen, Niles, I need to talk to you about Dad.
Oh yes, how is the Bobby Fischer of the geriatric circuit?
Well, he's still beating me.
I tell you, Niles, I just can't figure it out ?
I am the superior player.
There's a saying: "In every boy's life, the moment of greatest joy and greatest sorrow is when he defeats his father for the first time".
If you're suggesting that I'm afraid to beat Dad, you can just stop right there.
O.K. The other option is, he's better than you.
You were saying?
Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father.
It's the natural order.
Yet it's frequently a stumbling block because the son's competitive stirrings are accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.
I see.
Yes, it's the classic Oedipal conflict.
It seems so obvious now.
I've been letting him win!
Niles, thank you,thank you very much.
I can't tell you what a relief this is.
I feel like a weight has been lifted.
Nothing can hold me back now.
Tonight, I topple the king!
Hear, hear.
Of course, you realize by dethroning Dad, you're next in line to be dethroned by Frederick, and then the only thing left after that is death, but that's another day and another cup of coffee.
Dad?
Dad, wake up, it's your turn.
Oh, I'm sorryCheckmate.
Well, I'm going to bed.
Oh, come on, Dad, just one more game!
No!
I can't keep my eyes open.
Playing chess again, were you?
You know, Dr. Crane, when one of my brothers would lose a soccer match, he'd be all blue and in the dumps.
But I could get him to laugh.
I'd make a little puppet like so.
Hello, Daphne, What's shaking?
Oh, hello, Freddy.
My friend Dr. Crane here forgot his happy pants!
Oh, no!
What should I do?
Would you sing for him?
I'd love to.
Who's that grouchy gus I see?
You can't be grouchy, not with me!
Sing along, Doc!
Who's that grouchy gus I see?
Daphne, I would rather have a tarantula lay eggs in my ear than listen to any more of this puppet show.
Do we understand each other?
Eddie!
Speak!
Speak, Eddie!
Fire!
Fire, everybody!
Frasier!
Daphne!
Fire!
Fire!
What's going on?
!
The fire alarm went off, but I don't see anything around here!
It's not in my room, either!
It's O.K.!
My fault, false alarm.
I was just a little remiss in replacing the batteries, everything's fine.
The batteries?
No, smoke alarms don't go off if?
Back to bed!
See you in the morning.
Dad, you know, seeing as how we're both up, I thought maybe we should, oh I dunno, do something, you know?
Like what?
Well, uh, right off the top of my head, I well, play a little chess?
Now?
Well, sure!
We're both wide awake.
Oh my God, you set that alarm off!
Dad!
IÂI had no?
What kind of weird, competitive freak are you?
I mean, you really hate to lose so much that you wake up the whole house and scare us all to death?
No, of course not!
And I wouldn't have to resort to such lengths if this damn dog could learn to speak!
Oh, of course, now you'll get it right!
Look, Dad, would one more game kill you?
I mean, you're all riled up.
My God, you'll never get to sleep now anyway!
Wait a minute.
This isn't about losing, is it?
This is about losing to me.
That's what's driving you nuts!
"How could I lose to the old man?
I'm much smarter than he is"!
I never said that!
No, you didn't have to say it, you've thought it all your life!
No, I haven't!
Yes, you have, and now you're insulting my intelligence again!
Oh, Dad!
Hey, now listen, what do you think I was doing as a detective all those years?
Analyzing clues, devising strategies, trying to stay one or two steps ahead of the other guys now, does that sound like any game that you know?
All right, that explains why you can play the game, but not why you beat me every time!
Now, come on, just one more game, please?
Dad, look, I'll never bring it up again!
Come on!
No.
Why should I?
You just want to beat me so that you can go back to thinking you're smarter than your stupid old man.
Well, forget it, to hell with you.
I don't see any reason why I should ever play you again.
If you win, I'll give you five thousand dollars.
Get out of my way.
Well, look at that, the board's all set up!
What a surprise.
I took the liberty.
Now, Dad, I think we can sit down and play a nice cordial little game.
For centuries, people have set aside their differences to play a game of chess.
So, who should go first?
Well, let's see.
It's usually the person who lost the last game.
Now, who could that be?
OK.
No more Mr. Cordial Guy!
By the way, I'm sorry the ratings for your show took a dive last month.
Don't try to pull your cheap psychological tricks on me.
Oh, did I mention the cemetery called?
Apparently they have to dig a sewer next to your plot.
Getting your dog to stare at me only proves how desperate you are.
I didn't tell him to do that.
He just gets fascinated when he sees people sweat.
I sweat when I'm happy.
Well, then you must be ecstatic!
No, wait!
No, no, you took your finger off that piece!
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did!
That means that you must not trust that move, must have left yourself vulnerable somewhere.
Well, even if I did, you'll never find it.
Oh, look at that what's this?
Could it be checkmate?
I won, I won, I really won!
Hey, I didn't gloat when I beat you all those times!
No, but, I bet you wish you did now, huh?
Ha-ha, it feels great!
All right, that's it.
I'm going to bed.
And I never want to hear the word "chess," or "board," or "chessboard" again!
That's it, got it?
Fine.
Fine, Dad.
Goodnight.
Geez, lighten up!
It's only a game!
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, jeez No, no, please, just one question: did you let me win?
Oh, for crying out loud, Frasier No, no, please, did you play your best?
For five thousand bucks?
What do you think?
You wouldn't just be saying that?
On your mother's grave, may lightning strike me down, I, Martin Crane, swear on the holiest of Bibles, you won, I lost, fair and square, cross my heart and hope to go to sleep.
Thank you, Dad.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry I beat you, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, how does he always hear me?
He doesn't.
He just swings through every twenty minutes.
He knows you'll be eating some kind of junk.
Well, I don't want him eating these.
Well, then do what I do when I want Eddie away from me.
I make a sound like La la la la la la la la la la la!
That's mean!
Why?
It doesn't really hurt his ears.
He just finds certain noises irritating.
That was the most riveting production of Wagner I have seen this season.
I still have goose bumps from when Klingsor summoned Kundry with a terrible cry and ordered her to seduce Parsifal: "Ha!
Er Ist Shun Der Knabe"!
Well, I had a pretty good night too.
Took myself a nice, hot bath.
And, remember that corn I had on my toe?
Well, it got so soft I was just able to peel it right off.
Um it's going to be difficult for me to top that, but I have some rather exciting news myself.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the Safford case that's been in the papers recently?
Oh, you mean that scum-sucking jerk who's trying to get his father committed?
Yes.
Well, guess who's been retained by that scum-sucking jerk!
I'm going to be testifying as an expert witness at Mr. Safford's capacity hearing.
Wait a minute.
You're gonna help sell that poor old guy down the river?
Not at all.
Mr. Safford is unbalanced.
His son is worried sick about him.
Oh, his son's worried he's not gonna get his hands on his father's fortune.
Boy, the minute a man starts getting up there his kids start making plans to divvy up his stuff.
Dad, you'll be pleased to know that Niles and I have decided to give all your things to charity.
We're donating your clothes to the blind.
Well, it's just not right.
A bunch of moneygrubbers behind closed doors trying to declare this poor old guy insane.
For starters, it's not behind closed doors.
The entire proceeding will be broadcast on Court TV.
Oh, great.
What father doesn't look forward to the day he gathers his friends around the TV and says, "Hey, that's my boy.
The one making the old man cry".
Dad, I'm sure Niles is only doing this to protect Mr. Safford from himself.
Old age doesn't have to be that way, you know.
My great-aunt Beryl lived well into her nineties, and her mind never failed her.
Of course, she lost her eyesight in her seventies, and her balance in her eighties.
By the end we spent most of our time propping her up or putting another bandage on her forehead.
Oh, but bless her heart, she could always tell you just how it happened.
Well, Safford is clearly irrational.
Recently, he wandered off.
They found him two days later riding across Wyoming in a boxcar full of bums; he's taken to selling off property for half its worth; and most damning of all, when I went over to evaluate him, he continually referred to me as "Sparky".
I don't know, Niles, you always wanted to have a nickname.
You remember your campaign to have the string section of the youth orchestra call you "Rocky"?
It would have worked, too, if Tilly Farraday hadn't pinned me to the ground with her trombone when I rebuked her for neglecting to clean her spit valve.
Well, I still think picking on the old man stinks.
God help you if you're over fifty and you do anything that seems the least bit odd to your family.
And I'm pretty sure he's having an affair with his secretary.
Well, have you talked to your husband and heard his side of the story?
No.
Well, Beth, it does seem that your fears may be well-founded, but I still think you should talk to your husband before you come to any final conclusions.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good day, and good mental health.
Here are those PSAs, we'll do them tomorrow before the show.
Thank you, Roz.
Roz, why is that light still on?
Is that Beth who I was talking to?
No!
Yes, it is!
No, it isn't!
Yes, it is!
It is not!
Have you been talking to Beth?
Of course not!
What do you think - I'm giving advice to your callers?
Oh, Frasier, you are so paranoid.
The world is full of enemies.
Everybody's plotting against you.
There's a man in a dark trench coat right behind you.
Ho-ho, very droll.
Dr. Crane?
I'm John Giroux.
I work for Harlow Safford.
Oh, Mr. Giroux, I'm afraid there's been some mistake.
It's my brother who's connected with the case.
Oh, we're quite aware of that, but Mr. Safford feels he's the victim of a grave injustice.
He's an ardent fan of your show and feels you're the only man who can help him.
Well, that's very flattering, but given my brother's connection with the case, it wouldn't be very prudent for me to get involved.
Won't you at least talk to my client?
Judge him by his words and his actions, not by how old he is?
You sound like my father - a man who believes that burial is a form of age discrimination.
If you stop by this evening, I'm convinced you'll find Mr. Safford is completely competent.
Even if you won't testify on his behalf, perhaps you could at least get your brother to reconsider his testimony.
It's highly unlikely that I would disagree with my brother's opinion.
I really admired your advice to that last caller - you know, about not judging someone until you've heard his side of the story?
You're a good lawyer, Mr. Giroux.
Mr. Safford only seeks out the very best.
I'll see you at seven?
The address is on the back of my card.
I don't care what Dr. Crane said.
You start talking to your husband and he'll start covering his tracks.
Get a detective now.
You were talking to my last caller.
I swear; it's the first and last time.
I will never do it again.
I hope not.
Thanks for holding, Bill.
I'm listening.
Enjoy your tour?
Uh yes, yes.
That's quite a model railroad Mr. Safford has running through the grounds.
I've never seen one on quite that scale.
Impressive, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Yes, especially when it's bearing down on you.
I got my heels stuck in the soft grass.
I barely made the crossing.
Tell me, how often does Mr. Safford play with his train?
Just the weekends, when he gives rides to underprivileged children.
Very admirable.
There's a lot you don't know about him, Dr. Crane.
That's why you're here.
Yes, well, I promise to consider all the evidence before I arrive at a conclusion.
I think I've arrived.
Hiya, Sparky.
I'm Harlow Safford.
Dr. Frasier Crane.
I don't believe I've ever seen a fire pole in a home before.
Oh, it saves a lot of time.
Except for going up, of course.
And, uh, the hat?
Oh, it's just for laughs.
Oh, try it on.
Well, no, I don't think I should.
Oh, come on!
I guess it is sort of fun, isn't it?
Not on you.
So, do you think you can convince my self-righteous son that I'm not nuts?
Oh, I think "nuts" is a little strong.
He must have meant that your behavior might seem to most people to be a little unconventional.
Well, good.
I've spent my whole life being conventional.
Then one day I said to myself, "Harlow, you're not having any fun".
Do you speak to yourself often?
Don't try to trip me up, Sparky.
Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you, I'm trying to cut down on lollipops.
Thank you.
But tell me, why do you call people "Sparky"?
It makes them smile.
Right, Sparky?
You ought to try it with your patients.
Oh, I'm not too sure how warmly that would be embraced by those undergoing electroshock.
Um, anyway, your son tells me that you recently sold some property at a fraction of its value.
That's right.
Terrific young married couple had their hearts set on it, but couldn't afford it.
So, I helped them out.
There's nothing wrong with helping people.
Well, he also informed me that you recently indulged in an unorthodox, not to mention hazardous mode of travel.
That pompous weenie.
That's exactly how he would put it.
Well, actually, that was my wording.
Well, I hopped a freight.
Rode the rails.
Well, why not just purchase a ticket and ride in a club car?
Where's the adventure in that?
I'm 78.
Someday I'll be too old to jump off a moving train!
No, you gotta live out your fantasies while you can.
Can you understand that?
I think I can.
Mr. Safford, what you've said makes a great deal of sense.
Before we go on, there's something I have to ask you.
Shoot.
It's a little embarrassing.
I can take it.
Okay.
Can I slide down that pole?
Follow me, Sparky!
Dad, are you going to watch something now?
Yeah, the championship fight.
But don't worry, I'm using my earphones, I won't bother anyone.
Oh, you've already been a bother - making me hide the sports section so he won't see it.
Making me turn the news off because they might say who won.
I don't understand.
Well, the fight was last night.
It was on Pay TV.
But one of my police buddies has a pirate antenna.
So, he taped it and they messengered one to me in an envelope marked "Official Business".
Another inspiring tale of our men in law enforcement.
Why are you walking funny?
Well, suffice it to say I learned today it is unwise to slide repeatedly down a fire pole wearing woolen trousers.
Daphne, would you?
Oh, I'll get it.
Evening, Daphne.
Oh, Dr. Crane, don't say anything about last night's boxing match.
Your dad hasn't seen it yet.
Oh, I didn't even know it was boxing season.
Well, did everyone see my mention in this morning's paper?
No, I'm afraid I missed that.
Well, small wonder.
They buried it all the way back on page 32.
It's here, it's next to the sports section.
Hey, get that out of here!
Let me see.
It's right there.
Oh.
"Court TV this week will feature the capacity hearing of noted timber baron Harlow Safford.
[ Testifying on behalf of the family will be Dr. Niles Crane, eminent psychiatrist, author and leading authority on clinical psychosis.
Dr. Crane is also the brother of" Yadda-yadda, the rest is filler.
Niles, I have to talk to you about something.
Just after the show today I was visited by a man named Mr. Giroux.
He asked me to represent Mr. Safford.
What?
!
Shh!
I'm sorry.
Given your involvement with the case, I naturally declined.
Oh, thank God.
But, I did agree to see if I concurred with your analysis and speak to Mr. Safford.
What?
!
Hey, keep it down!
I just have to tell you that I found Harlow Safford to be of completely sound mind - and don't say "What"?
!
Why?
!
Quiet!
!
Perhaps it'd be better if we spoke somewhere else.
You couldn't stand that I had a high-profile case, could you?
So you had to butt into it!
I just don't want you to make a fool of yourself.
These people came to me, they asked for my expertise.
Oh, ha!
They were undoubtedly exploiting your dubious celebrity.
Of which you are jealous and, I fear, the reason you took this case!
That is flatly untrue!
I took the case to help the family!
And to be on television!
I don't give a hoot about television!
Well, some of us do!
!
Niles, you made a hasty judgment and I am sorry, but you were wrong.
Ah, now we see why you got involved in the case - so big brother could be right and little Niles could be wrong, which I'm not!
Oh, your pathetic childhood issues have nothing to do with it.
Face it, you were wrong!
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Oh, oh, oh-!
This from Mr. Quick-Fix, the master of the in-depth, one-minute phone call diagnosis!
I spent several hours with Mr. Safford and I found his behavior to be Wildly irrational.
He's a lip-diddling loon!
You think anything that's even slightly spontaneous is aberrant.
That's ridiculous!
The man's incompetent!
Niles, I'm warning you.
If you get up in that courtroom and say that, you will damage yourself professionally!
I'm testifying, and you're not going to stop me!
Fine, then you leave me no choice but to testify against you!
Well, in that case, I'll see you in court!
Good, I look forward to it!
So do I!
Good!
Good!
HEY!
!
Daphne, please.
Turn down that radio.
Dad is trying to watch a fight!
So, how are you holding up?
Oh, I'm fine.
Now look, Sparky.
I know you don't want to take any money for helping me.
But at least let me make a donation to your favorite charity.
Well it was my duty, not to mention a pleasure, to help you.
But if you'd like to donate something, why don't youselect a charity of your own choosing?
Fair enough.
Good.
Excuse me.
Hello, Niles.
You know, it's not to late to ask them to put a big blue ball in front of your face during the broadcast.
Perhaps spare you some shred of your reputation.
I'd laugh in your face but I'm saving my voice.
Oh my God!
You're wearing makeup!
I am not!
This is medication.
Something my dermatologist recommended.
Dr. Revlon?
These feeble attempts to undermine my confidence are futile.
The testimony I've prepared is nothing short of brilliant.
I cite half a dozen studies of gerontology.
I quote everything from the Bible to Herodotus.
I deftly interweave humor with pathos.
You may want to take notes.
And if you had an ounce of self-awareness you would realize that your diagnosis was colored by your zeal to put your face in front of that camera.
Oh, by the way, your medication is rubbing off on your collar.
All rise.
Court is in session.
Judge Richard McCarron presiding.
Hello, your honor.
Be seated.
Good morning.
Has everyone been sworn in?
Yes, your honor.
Well, I see we have two Dr. Cranes testifying today.
Mr. Giroux, I think we'll hear from your authority first.
I assume the other Dr. Crane has no objection to that arrangement?
None whatsoever, your honor.
I'm over here, Dr. Crane.
Your honor, I would not presume to bore the court with a recitation of dry statistics, gerontology studies, obscure literary references.
Instead, I intend to speak from the heart.
I worry about a society that has chosen to define normalcy in such narrow terms that if someone's behavior deviates ever so slightly, we question his capacity to function.
Mr. Safford's seeming eccentricities - his love of trains, his generosity - they can all be readily explained.
Diabetes!
Mr. Safford?
I was talking to Sparky.
Uh Did you say diabetes?
Yes.
We'll donate the money to diabetes.
Those poor people can't eat sugar!
Fine..
fine.
Uh we'll, uh we'll talk about it afterwards.
May we continue, Dr. Crane?
My apologies, your honor.
Mr. Safford and I were discussing a very sizable donation he intends to make later today to a very worthy cause.
I guess his enthusiasm just got the best of him.
But, it is this very generosity that his son finds so objectionable.
That, and the fact that he did hop a freight train across the country.
But, you see, what he sees as unstable, I see as romantic.
I I don't suppose there's a railroad track outside the courtroom?
Uh doesn't Mr. Safford deserve to be a bit of a free spirit after the years of his demanding career?
A career in which he wore many hats.
Um the hat of a father, a philanthropist, a C.E.O All aboard!
All aboard!
Get your tickets ready.
Have your tickets ready, please.
Have your tickets ready.
In the end, it all comes down to this: can we really condemn a man for maintaining a childlike joie de vivre even in his twilight years?
All aboard for the Coast Express.
Yes, making stops in Tacoma, Olympia, Portland and Salem.
And the next stop is I think I know where your next stop is going to be.
Now, look, Niles.
Before you start gloating, let me just say this.
You were right, I was wrong.
Big deal.
The world never got a chance to hear me be right.
I suppose by now it's obvious that what you were saying all along was true.
I do envy your fame.
Well, perhaps this public humiliation will cure me of my damned competitiveness.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I humiliated myself far more than you did today.
Obviously, you didn't see the way I was whoring after that TV camera.
Obviously, you didn't see how I was tap dancing up there like an organ grinder's monkey.
Yes, well, I might as well have been tarred and feathered.
I might as well have been pilloried in the town square.
I might as well have been stripped naked and forced to Oh, stop it, Niles!
We're doing it again!
Niles, you have no reason to feel badly.
Everyone wants to be recognized for something they're good at.
And you are a good psychiatrist.
Thank you, Frasier.
Something I can't really lay claim to after today.
How could I have so misjudged that man?
Well, he's undeniably charming for one thing.
And he can be lucid for long stretches of time.
Yes, but you weren't fooled.
Somehow, you picked up on some tiny clue that I missed.
You remember what it was?
Yes.
Midway through our interview he took off his trousers and tried to put them on the cat.
Well, I'd like to think that I might have picked up on that one too.
Still Frasier, you've always approached life with a positive attitude.
It's a quality I admire of yours.
Perhaps your judgment was clouded by your desire to see old age not as a time of inevitable decline, but as a time when one's childhood passions and fantasies can be reborn.
Thank you, Niles.
You know what would cheer me up right now?
What?
I would like to hear that summation you never got a chance to give.
Really?
Yes.
You're not just saying that?
Do you care?
No!
Well, all right then.
I'm the judge!
I'm the judge!
Okay, you be the judge.
All rise.
Yes, here we are.
Have we been sworn in?
Yes we have, your honor.
Dr. Crane, proceed.
Your honor, I believe it was Herodotus who said: "Circumstances rule men.
Men do not rule circumstances".
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Faster, Frasier, faster!
You can make this light!
God, you're going to get us killed!
I can't be late for this date!
Oh, this is ridiculous!
First the drycleaner, then the ATM, now you're making me cart you off to some restaurant!
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't plan for my car to be in the shop.
But I really, really appreciate it, Frasier.
Oh, a basket of fruit would suffice!
I am changing for my date!
Don't look at me!
Turn around!
Turn all the way around!
I'm driving!
Fine!
Hand me my jeans, will you?
Here.
Oh, oh, great!
That's just what i need!
There's a police car behind us.
Please don't turn on the red light.
Don't turn on the red light.
Don't turn on the Damn it, Frasier!
Don't worry, you're not going to get a ticket.
You're a celebrity, use a little juice!
Oh, I refuse to do anything of the sort!
OK, fine.
Enjoy traffic school.
Good Evening, officer.
I'm Doctor Fraiser Crane If there's any problem I'm listening.
I clocked you doing sixty-two in a forty-mile zone.
Well, this is interesting.
Usually both people are in the backseat.
It's not what you think.
See, we were just coming back from KACL, where I do my radio show.
Uh-huh.
You see, we ran a little late, because I was on with a very troubled caller, with a very complex psychological problem on my radio show.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're Dr. Frasier Crane!
Drat!
My cover is blown.
I love your show!
I listen to it all the time.
Oh well, thank you.
It's always nice to License and registration, please.
Be arrested by a fan.
Roz, if you could delay ablutions?
I'm in custody here!
Hey, it's your birthday today.
Is this a little celebration?
No, no, I'm simply taking my producer to meet her date.
Frasier, why didn't you tell me it was your birthday?
I'd have thrown you a party at the station!
Question asked, question answered.
I'm just going to be dropping her off, then have a cold plate of deli, and get to bed early.
Almost makes you feel sorry for me, doesn't it?
I spent my last birthday subduing a drunk-and-disorderly at a sleazy bar.
Don't you hate to work on your birthday?
He was my date.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to let you off.
Just think of this as a little birthday gift from me.
Thank you.
But slow down.
I'd hate to see you get hurt.
I'm listening.
OK, let's go!
Do you sense a little moment there?
What are you talking about?
!
Well, between me and that very attractive officer.
It just felt like there was something there.
Yeah, major sparks.
Now, just the right pedal.
The big pedal?
Now, just a minute.
We'll see if she's watching me.
If she's watching me, she's interested.
Oh, yes!
She's turning around, she's looking up!
Move your vehicle!
Oh, yes.
I've cast my spell.
Crane, make a wish.
Oh, why bother?
I made the same wish last year, it didn't come true.
Come on, son, blow out the candles!
Oh, what a surprise.
Look, they're lighting again!
What sorcerer's magic is this?
You know, Dad, I had a nice little birthday bonus today.
On my way home, I was pulled over for speeding by a very pretty policewoman, who let me off.
I got the distinct impression that she found me attractive.
Now, that sort of thing happens, doesn't it?
Oh, sure.
I was always leaning against somebody's window thinking, "that bloody chainsaw in the backseat looks kind of iffy, but she's got a cute smile"!
Oh, ha, ha.
I'm telling you, there was something there, though.
Well, of course the whole conversation's academic.
I don't even know her name.
I suppose I could call down to the police station and try to find out who was on traffic duty.
But, uh, I don't suppose they'd give that sort of information to a civilian.
You'd have to have some conduit to the police department, an insider who could break that damnable code of silence!
All right, I'll make the damn call.
You, Dad?
Why, I didn't even think of?
Oh, shut up.
You know, I haven't felt such an instant attraction to a woman in quite some time.
Well, considering the difference in our backgrounds, it's really rather puzzling.
Oh, pish-tosh!
It's painfully obvious what's attracting you the gleam of her jackboots, her dangling nightstick, the glint of her handcuffs hanging on her leather belt.
You're off on some lurid little disciplinary fantasy.
Oh, Dr. Crane, shame on you!
You got icing up and down your sleeve!
Oh.
I am a naughty boy.
Well, certainly a messy one.
But mainly a naughty one.
Hey, Charlie, yeah, Marty Crane, how ya doing?
Hey, listen, Charlie, I'm trying to track down a woman officer who was on traffic tonight, uh, near Blanchett and Fourth.
Blanchett and Fourth.
Great, OK, thanks.
Her name's Maureen Cutler, and she usually goes to McGinty's after work.
Charlie said she's probably there now.
Thanks, Dad.
Are you going to go?
Well, I don't know.
A police bar?
If I go in there alone, I'll stand out like a sore thumb!
All right, I'll go.
Sit down, Niles, I'll go with him.
You know, after all these hoity-toity, caviar-sucking egghead types you've been dating, I think a lady cop would be a nice breath of fresh air.
Oh, all right, I'll go!
Give me a second, I'll put some fresh collar-stays in, and-oh, oh, I've got a fabulous brand-new cashmere jacket I've been dying to premiere!
Oh, yeah.
This is gonna work.
You see her yet?
I don't know.
What about her?
No, that's not Maureen.
No, I mean, what about her?
Oh, there she is!
Wow, she is a looker!
Well, come on, let's go say hello.
Oh well!
Oh my God, fancy seeing you here!
Hey, Frasier Crane.
Oh, you remember me?
Come on ?
sixty-two in a forty-mile zone with a half-naked girl in the backseat?
Roz.
Oh.
Oh, uh, this is my father.
How do you do?
I'm Maureen Cutler.
Marty Crane, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Say, Maureen, how about a drink?
Yeah, why not?
Let me get them.
I'm a beer drinker myself, what about you?
That's fine by me.
Beer, huh?
Oh, what the hell, I'll try one.
So, what brings you guys here?
This is mostly a cop hangout.
Well, I used to be on the force.
Really?
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Marty Crane?
You're Martin Crane!
You're wasting your time in traffic, you're quite a detective.
No, I mean I remember you when I was training.
You gave this great lecture at the academy on how to deal with an armed suspect.
Well, thanks.
How come you left the force?
Well, I uh, got shot by an armed suspect.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
So, do you miss it?
Nah, how attached can you get to a hip?
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to get over to the hospital.
I told them to beep me if there was any news about my sergeant.
What happened to him?
She's having a baby.
Oh well, hope it's a girl!
Yeah, I'll tell Frasier you had to run.
Thanks listen, um, I never do this, but I would love to have a beer or go to dinner sometime.
With me?
I don't want to put you on the spot.
If you, uh, if you want to go out, just give me a call.
With me?
You're the only one here.
Here we are!
Three beers.
Good news, there was a fly in one glass, so these are free!
I'm sorry, I just got beeped.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, but it was nice to see you.
Maybe I'll bump into you again here sometime.
Oh, that'd be great.
OK, bye.
I'll have a grande half-caf latte, with a whisper of cinnamon.
And for my father, plain coffee.
I cannot emphasize the word "plain" enough.
No foam, no cinnamon, no exotic flavors.
If it is not plain, I take no responsibility for the consequences.
How about a biscotti?
All right.
But when you bring it, call it a cookie.
Hi, son.
Hello, Dad.
Uh, I want to thank you for meeting me like this.
Well, my pleasure.
So what can I do you for?
Well, I need some advice.
That's why you asked me here?
Yeah.
You've never done this before!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
But anyway, you remember?
Dad, I want you to know I'm not only deeply touched, but I consider this a watershed moment in our relationship!
Great.
See, the thing is?
All my life, it seems you've always turned to Frasier.
"Frasier, Frasier, Frasier"!
Niles, can I talk?
!
I'm listening.
Here we are.
One latte, one coffee, and one "cookie".
I think they call this thing a biscotti.
No need to talk down to the man.
Off you go!
Well, anyway, uh, you remember the other night, Frasier's policewoman?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, we found her at the bar, and, uh, well, she came on to me.
No.
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Was she drunk?
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, of course, you're right, I'm sorry.
Uh, what was Frasier's reaction?
I haven't told him yet.
Why not?
I just can't.
Can I?
I know he's going to feel lousy.
He finally meets a girl he likes, and she's attracted to his old man.
Hmm, that is quite a conundrum.
I wonder if that's what's really bothering you.
What do you mean?
Maybe, underneath it all, you're attracted to this woman and you want to go out with her.
Oh, are you, nuts?
That's sick!
That's disgusting!
"it's just a theory".
But for the sake of argument, let's say you're right.
Dad, you're allowed to be attracted to a woman.
What kind of a father does a thing like that?
Did you encourage her in any way?
Well, I guess I was kind of charming.
I mean, I didn't mean to be!
It just sometimes leaks out.
Well, what do you want to do?
Well, most important I don't want to hurt Frasier.
And secondly, I want to go out with Maureen.
The order of that changes depending on the time of day.
Well, one possibility is, go on a date with her.
If you feel there are sparks between you and this woman, then tell Frasier.
I don't want to lie to my son.
You're not lying to him.
You're delaying the truth to spare his feelings.
If nothing happens, he need never know.
Well, I guess it's worth a try.
If Maureen and I hit it off, then I'll tell him immediately.
Or I can.
Really, I don't mind!
Hi, Dad.
Oh, Frasier!
You're still home.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
Just out.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing.
When are you gonna be home?
Later.
Well, you put a dent in the car, young man, it's coming out of your allowance!
I mean, I've got my pride, you know.
So, I said to her, I said, "Mrs. Crease, I'll do the cooking, I'll do the cleaning, but I draw the line at creaming your feet"!
Dear, hurry up!
"The Mambo Kings" is about to start!
Oh, I wouldn't mind mamboing with Antonio Banderas!
All right, set out the goodies and I'll go get the wine.
Oh, and this time, Charlotte, be careful with that chocolate!
I had a hell of a time hiding the stain from His Nibs Oh, hello, Dr. Crane!
Daphne.
Charlotte, Maggie.
Dr. Crane.
Please, sit down.
I thought you were filling in at the station tonight.
Oh, I am.
But, uh, not for a couple of hours yet.
Oh-ho, seems a shame to hang around here.
I mean, I would have thought you'd have taken an opportunity like this to, I don't know go down to McGinty's?
Oh, to see his new lady friend, you mean?
Ah, well, I see I've been quite the hot topic over the teapot.
You know, I may have said a thing or two in passing, but?
I'd go for it, Dr. Crane!
Yes, well, if you must know, I was planning to go down there, but not for a couple of days yet.
Well, I wouldn't wait too long.
I mean, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I always say!
She's right.
Well, women don't really like men that are too overeager.
Oh, nonsense.
I mean, you know, it's one thing if the man's some bounder git from the docks, but it's different if the man's like you.
Someone who's charming.
And handsome.
And knows lots and lots of words.
Well, McGinty's is on my way to the station.
I suppose I could just pop my head in.
Thank you, ladies, for your support ?
even if it was nakedly self-serving and insincere.
So, they finally put my transfer through, and I'm moving out of Traffic and into Narcotics.
Yeah, I'm gonna be working with, uh, Bill Henderson at the 31st.
Good for you.
Yeah, I'm excited, although I hear he can be pretty tough.
Oh no.
I mean, he might seem a little stiff and strait-laced, but once you get to know him he's the greatest guy in the world.
Yeah, he is pretty impressive.
Oh yeah, smart, great sense of humor.
No, you're gonna have a great time.
Dad, I can't believe you're doing this!
Frasier!
Look, I was gonna tell you?
Believe me, I did not put him up to this, though I think he's overselling me a little.
I'm not the greatest guy in the world.
Seattle, maybe.
Am I missing something?
Oh, I'm just joking.
OK, Dad, thanks for warming her up for me.
I can take over here.
Martin?
Frasier Maureen and I are here on a date.
I know you might think this is one of those wildly embarrassing moments where I'm standing here with egg on my face.
I assure you, I'm not as embarrassed as you might assume I would be embarrassed.
I'm not uncomfortable, so please, don't you be uncomfortable either.
Why don't I give you two a moment?
Whatever!
You asked her out?
!
No, that's not the way it happened.
There's no use lying to me.
I am at the lowest point I could possibly be, so please just tell me the truth!
Maureen asked me out.
Going down!
It happened the other night when you went to the bar to get drinks.
You know, it just caught me off guard, I didn't know how to handle it.
So, Niles said I should?
Niles?
Niles knows?
Look, I'm sorry.
It was supposed to be a one-time thing, just to see if there was something there, and if there wasn't, then you didn't even need to know about it.
Well, is there?
"Something there"?
Oh, yeah.
Well it's not as if we were standing side-by-side when she chose you.
I was at the bar!
If you'd gone to get the drinks, things would have been different.
I don't think so.
Dad, I'm drowning here.
Please, throw me a line!
Look, uh, I'm gonna go tell her this whole thing is a mistake?
No, no, no, Dad!
I'll be OK, really.
Well the old dog's still got it in him, huh?
Yeah.
But, really, how long can it last?
I mean, she's got to come to her senses eventually?
Oh no, Dad, Dad, don't sell yourself short.
You've got a lot to offer.
Well, I'd better head off to work.
Goodnight, Dad.
Goodnight, thanks.
Damn!
Uh-uh, OK, thanks.
Frasier just came in the building, so everybody hide and be quiet.
Do you think he'll be surprised?
Considering his birthday was yesterday?
Yeah, I do, Elizabeth.
Should we yell "surprise" or "happy birthday"?
We've done this like five hundred times.
And every time it's pretty much the same.
We yell, the person pretends to be surprised, and we stuff ourselves with cake.
I just wanted it to be perfect.
And that is what makes you so special to us.
Now get under the console!
Hi, Frasier!
How you doing?
Oh, just wonderful.
Forty-three is off to a rousing start.
Remember that policewoman I was interested in?
Yeah?
Well, she's dating my father!
Your father?
Mmm-hmm!
Well, never mind that.
I know just what will take your mind off of it.
I've got something really funny in my booth.
I spent the last hour wandering the streets, trying to take assessment of my life.
Do you know how long it's been since I've slept with a woman?
Seven months!
Frasier?
All right, nine months!
I really don't think we should talk about that right now!
Oh sure, fine, you can't spare me five minutes to talk about my problems, when every day I drop what I'm doing to be your personal Wailing Wall.
"Frasier, he stopped calling me".
"Frasier, he wants his key back".
"Frasier, his girlfriend is having me followed"!
I'm sorry.
So nine months, huh?
Nine long, long, months.
Oh You know who that woman was?
Who?
Edna, from Accounting.
No The next day, she dumped me!
I tell you, Roz, I'm starting to feel nostalgic for that summer in my twenties when I was impotent!
The only comfort I have now is knowing that my humiliation can't possibly get any worse!
SURPRISE!
Hi, Edna.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, Dr. Crane My God, after all our years together all the good times, all the bad times can't loan me a meager four thousand dollars?
You must appreciate how hard it is for me to approach you about this.
I thought I meant more to you than this, but apparently I don't.
And they call themselves "the friendly bank"!
What do you need to borrow money for?
I saw the most exquisite Biedermeier footstool.
For four thousand bucks?
Niles, your mother and I didn't pay that much for our first house.
I know, dad.
I lived there.
Well, I keep telling you, you don't have Maris's money tothrow around anymore.
You're going to have to start cutting back a little.
I have cut back.
Last month I told my masseur I could only see him once a week.
Oh, I remember that scene in "Grapes Of Wrath" when Ma Joad did that.
You know, if you need to save a bit, you should do what I do and cut out coupons.
Coupons.
Well, what a wonderful way to economize.
Well, I could clip them and give them to my personal shopper.
Oh, Niles, good morning.
Hey.
Daphne, has Bebe Glazer called back yet?
'Fraid not.
You're still consorting with that barracuda?
Well, a barracuda is what you want in an agent, Niles.
It's just that the station's been sold, I was hoping she might have some scuttlebutt on the new owner.
I must admit she's rather hard to get a hold of these days Oh, really?
I thought one just drew a pentagram on the floor and chanted "I summon thee" three times.
Hello, Roz.
Hey.
What have you got on the new owner?
Oh, plenty.
Yeah?
His name is Wilford S. Boone, but he likes to be called "Big Willy".
Well, there's a little snapshot of his psyche right there.
He's an eighty-five year-old Texan.
Practically no formal education but he went from errand boy at a radio station to owning his own media empire worth six hundred million.
This is great, I don't even know what "Renuzit" is, but it's twenty cents off and I want it.
You're clipping coupons?
I'm economizing.
Oh well it's about time, you spend money like a drunken sailor.
She said authoritatively.
Excuse me, could we get back to the subject at hand, please?
What are you so antsy about?
Dad, Wilford S. Boone- Big Willy.
Please, Roz, I just can't say that yet, alright?
Wilford S. Boone owns thirty radio stations across the country.
If he likes you he's been known to syndicate your show nationwide.
So, I'm trying to find out if we have anything in common an angle, if you will.
So what are his interests, Roz?
Well, it's all in there.
He likes whittling, rodeos, the novels of Zane Grey Gee, Fras.
It's like you two were separated at birth.
He also owns a 5,000 acre cattle ranch and the world's largest collection of antique six-shooters.
Oh dear God, I'm sucking up to Yosemite Sam!
I think if we really want to impress Big Willy we should think of some Western theme to do for the show today.
Great idea, Roz.
Why don't we just start the show off with a segment on how to get in touch with your inner young'un.
What a fascinating theory!
Do go on.
What's going on?
Oh, this is great.
I told Gil the new station owner is a Greek tycoon.
He fell for that?
Hook, line, and souvlaki!
You can keep your overripe Camembert and malodorous Stilton, they can't compare with the salty insouciance of Greece's glorious Feta.
It's not just for shepherds anymore!
This is Gil Chesterton saying Bon Appetite, or as we say in Athens, Kali Orexi!
Oh Gil, you've been had.
The new station owner isn't Greek, he's from Texas.
You are so easy!
Well, I hope you're happy!
I've just given four stars to a restaurant called "A Taste Of Greece".
Which, trust me, is no misnomer.
Well that's what you deserve, trying to suck up to some senile old coot!
Hell, he probably can't eat anything but strained peas and farina!
Uh, Mr Boone?
Yeah, that's right.
Pleasure to see you.
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
This is Roz Doyle, Gil Chesterton and I'm Skippy the lunch boy.
So, uh, that's two strained peas and a farina for the big guy.
Oh, uh, Skippy?
Change my order!
I've got a sudden hankering for baby-back ribs and corn bread.
Oh, I've been looking for you Dr. Crane.
I have a little problem and they told me you're just the fella who could fix it.
Oh, I hope I'm not imposing.
Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone.
Well, actually I prefer "Big Willy".
Don't be silly, Big Willy.
You see, I'm engaged to be married.
Oh, congratulations.
Well, sweet young thing.
Just nuts about me.
Problem is, she smokes.
Oh lord, that is a very bad habit.
Oh, it's a vile habit!
Would have destroyed my affection for her if, well she didn't possess certain compensating gifts.
Anyway, as a favour to me, could you help her?
Well, I'll certainly try.
Just keep in mind, though, addiction is fraught with many complex issues.
Length of habit, motivation Forgive me, sometimes I don't express myself too clearly.
When I say, "could you help her," what I meant to say was HELP HER!
Consider it done.
Much obliged.
She'll be in touch.
That's me, Dr. Frasier Crane, bimbo wrangler.
Frasier, stop it!
This is a golden opportunity!
You makethis little tootsie quit smoking and we're halfway to syndication.
Did someone just say the word "syndication," or do I just hear it every time I lay eyes on my favorite client?
Oh, Bebe.
Is something wrong, dear?
Well, yes.
We just met Big Willy Oh, he thinks I'm some sort of a magician.
He wants me to play therapist to his little fiance?
No doubt some gold-digging piranha so devoid of scruples that she's willing to rob the coffin and just Oh, dear God!
Isn't it wonderful?
We met last month and it was love at first sight.
First sight of what - his bankbook and a cardiogram?
Two minutes.
I'm hurt that she can even joke about such a thing.
I love that dear sweet old man with every fibre of my being.
I'm sure you do.
I'm afraid there won't even be a wedding if you can't get rid of that rotten habit, and he's just ordered me to see that you do!
God, you'd think a touch of emphysema were the end of the world!
What's that in your hand, woman?
Sorry, pudd'n.
Bebe slipped.
Just that all-important last puff.
Well, see that it is!
Well, Dr. Crane, I'm heading out of town for three days.
When I get back on Sunday, I expect my little gal here to be smoke-free by then.
In three days?
Now, you do whatever it takes to help her, doc!
Drugs, straightjackets, electroshock You see how he dotes on me.
Excellent progress, Bebe!
You've really dived into the emotional void that is the route of your addiction.
Your fear of abandonment, your fear that those you trust will suddenly turn their backs when you expect them to Excuse me.
My God, it all seems so clear now.
You're a miracle worker.
If I had a dime for every time well Niles!
Hello Frasier, I noticed you were out of capers the other night, so I got you this.
Thank you Niles, but why so many?
I just discovered a place called "Price Buster's Warehouse".
You have to buy in bulk, but the savings are extraordinary and they have a huge selection.
I found french fries and french doors in the same aisle.
Well, the next time you go back be sure to buy me a thousand swordfish so I can use these up!
You laugh, but I could do it like that.
So, how goes the great smoke-out?
Until today, I had no idea what a brilliant therapist your brother is.
He has tunneled his way into the very depths of my psyche.
Well, let's hope he sent a canary down first.
Well, I'll be running along.
I'll see you at ten tomorrow.
In the mean time, it's exercise, lots of fresh spring water and nicotine gum for cravings.
That's my girl.
Oh, Bebe, you know I'm writing a paper on addiction and I'd love to ask you some questions - unless there's some reason you're eager to be off?
Me?
No.
No, not at all.
Well, I just need to discuss a personal matter with Frasier first.
Of course, I'll give you some privacy.
It's time for my water anyway.
Yes, Niles?
Let her out that door, she'll smoke half a pack before the elevator hits the lobby.
How can you know that?
You hardly spoke to her.
Well, obviously you didn't see the crazed, cunning glint in her eyes.
She always looks like that, she's an agent.
I know about addiction.
It's the exact same look Maris used to get during the cough syrup years.
The only way to deal with it is to lock her up, take her money, and watch her like a hawk until it's out of her system.
That means she would have to stay here for the weekend.
Who's staying all weekend?
Bebe Glazer.
Here?
What does she have to stay here for?
She's trying to quit smoking.
Oh great, that means she'll be extra lovable.
Not to worry dad, there is no reason she has to stay for the weekend.
Bebe and I made a real breakthrough today.
If you don't believe me, just come on into the kitchen and you'll see that I'm right.
I'm sorry I can't stay and help you with your paper, Niles, wedding preperations and all.
But I'll remember those helpful hints.
It's exercise, gum, and lots of water.
Water should come in handy for putting out those pesky purse fires.
All right Niles, secure the door!
Bebe, you are not going anywhere, you're staying for the weekend.
Now give me that purse.
All right.
Let me remove one very precious momento.
Very well.
Oh, stop it!
More!
What again?
That's her third serving.
Now, now Dad, it's flattering to Daphne that Bebe finds her food so tasty.
I'm orally fixated.
I could eat a half-stunned wharf rat if you put some gravy on it!
I'll bear that in mind come breakfast time.
No, please, please.
Let's all try to remain supportive of Bebe.
I think she's really doing rather well.
So, I hear your fiancee is well to do?
Very.
You gonna eat that fat?
Well, marrying money can have it's perils.
Ten or fifteen years down the line, after you've adapted to a lifestyle now totally beyond your means, you can find yourself cast aside a hollow husk, penniless and crushed.
Niles, Big Willy's eighty-five, he's on his third pacemaker.
Ah.
Mazel tov!
Just out of curiosity, has this guy ever seen you eat?
After dinner is the time I need a cigarette most.
As long as I don't stop eating, I'll be fine.
Well, this is very good, Bebe.
You're already identifying those moments that trigger your worst cravings.
Yeah, yeah!
No, really.
Perhaps it would help to know that you're not alone.
Dad is an ex-smoker.
Dad, can you tell us about those moments you crave a cigarette most?
Ah, when I had insomnia.
I'd get up, pour a water glass full of Bourbon, light a cigarette - next thing you know, I couldn't keep my eyes open.
Nothing relaxes you like a cigarette.
Of course, gives you a hell of a headache in the morning.
Well, I smoked for years but I never became addicted.
To this day, I can buy a pack, have a cig or two, toss them in a drawer and not crave another for months.
You know there's a word for people who can do that.
What is it?
Oh, yes - bitch!
There's no need to be insulting just because you're wrestling with an unhealthy and disgusting habit.
It isn't disgusting, it's wonderful!
Oh now, Bebe, tell me.
What is so wonderful about smoking?
Everything.
I like the way a fresh firm pack feels in my hand.
I like peeling away that little piece of cellophane and seeing it twinkle in the light.
I like coaxing that first sweet cylinder out of its hiding place and bringing it slowly up to my lips.
Striking a match, watching it burst into a perfect little flame and knowing that soon that flame will be inside me.
I love the first puff, pulling it into my lungs.
Little fingers of smoking filling me, caressing me, feeling that warmth penetrate deeper and deeper, until I think I'm going to burst!
Then - whoosh!
- watching it flow out of me in a lovely, sinuous cloud, no two ever quite the same.
More potatoes, anyone?
You're up early, Miss Moon.
Oh!
God, you startled me!
Ever since your little speech about smoking, I haven't been able to think about anything else.
Please, don't mention this to Dr. Crane.
Silence has its price, dear.
And I think we both know what that is.
Forget it!
You can't make me give you one of these.
Oh can't I?
!
You open up right now!
All right, missy, here's the drill!
You drop those cigarettes, I'll open the door, you kick 'em over to me, capisce?
No!
Oh, is it cold outside?
All right, you asked for it!
No!
No!
Please, I beg you.
Oh, oh no.
My fingers are getting weak.
Oh, oh, I'm losing my grip.
Stop, please!
I'll give you anything you want.
I'll I'll make you a star!
What the hell's going on out here?
Daphne was smoking!
She made me!
Daphne, give me those.
Oh, look at me!
I'm all damp and chilled to the bone.
I'll get you a towel.
My God, it's five-thirty in the morning!
Dad!
I couldn't sleep.
Have you people all lost your minds?
Alright, now listen, get back to bed, every one of you!
All right, all right Thank god you came in when you did!
She was praying on my weakness.
Who knows what I might have done, probably THIS!
Oh, get her!
Stop that woman!
Bebe, you will not be allowed to smoke a cigarette in this house!
No, no, don't even think about it!
All right, just give me those!
All right now, that's it!
Back to bed!
Oh my God, you're insane, woman!
That's it, no more house guests.
Get off me, you brute!
Hand them over!
Never!
That'll be the neighbours!
Hello?
Oh, hello!
One moment, please.
It's Big Willy!
Big Willy, hello!
No, no, it's not too early, everybody's up!
Well, you know, there have been a few minor setbacks, but I'm keeping on top of her, yeah.
Oh yeah, I know she'd love to say hi, hang on.
Hello, pudd'n.
I'm fine, and you?
Oh, nothing's too much trouble for you daddy.
Bye now!
Yes, sir?
Oh, oh, really?
No, no, I'm very flattered.
Yes, of course, I'd love to, I'll talk to you this evening.
Bye-bye.
Thank you, Daphne.
All right, now listen up!
He thinks I'm very gifted.
Mmm.
He thinks I'm wasting my talents in just one city!
My God, woman, he wants to take me national, don't you get it?
Unless YOU ruin it for me!
Oh my God, sorry.
Here, take 'em.
I don't know what came over me.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself, Bebe.
After all, addiction to Nicotine is a very, very difficult hey, wait a minute.
This pack is half-empty!
For God's sake I don't care anymore.
You know, I can't help you, nobody can.
You want to ruin it for both of us?
Here, go ahead, knock yourself out.
I only wish I could be there when it happens.
When what happens?
When you see that newspaper headline: "Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead".
Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral on the news.
Watch the casket being slipped into the ground.
Only, you won't be watching that.
No, no, you'll be watching the widow Boone.
Tiffany, perhaps.
Oh no, better yet, "Kelli" - with an "I"!
Stop it!
You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels, sailing in YOUR yachts, sleeping with YOUR gigolos - but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no!
Because you'll have your cigarette.
Yeah!
Clutched in your nicotine-stained teeth, smoke whirling about your once-pretty, now creased, leathery, smoke-ravaged Enough!
God!
You are one hell of a therapist.
Hey, you back from the wedding already?
No.
There was no wedding.
No wedding, no syndication deal What's she doing here?
No money, no fame Well, you might say things hit a bit of a snag.
No beach house, no pool boys Oh will you get a grip, Roz?
!
Well, what went wrong?
Well, they were halfway down the aisle - Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant, supporting Big Willy on her arm - when suddenly he clutched his heart, and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder.
Of course we were all concerned at first, but then suddenly it seemed like he was all right because they kept moving on down the aisle.
But if you looked carefully, you could see Bebe's little biceps bulging through her wedding gown, and I swear I noticed daylight between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet.
Well, once they got up to the minister the jig was pretty well up, despite Bebe's valiant attempts to animate his features by twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck.
You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed.
Well, if I were you I'd get her away from that balcony rail.
The doorman gets ticked if you even through a piece of gum over the side.
Bebe, dear?
Please, come on in.
That's a girl.
All right, let me have a look at you.
Come on, here we are.
Well, I don't really blame you, dear.
You know, Roz and I are both upset too.
You know, look at it this way: at least you're no worse off than you were before.
You don't know the things I did for that man - the depraved, Western-themed appetites I satisfied!
He was eighty-five, how bad could it have been?
Ever worn a saddle?
Do I have to answer that?
Well, you know, Bebe, there are other Big Willys out there, better ones!
Richer, older Impotent!
Oh dear, you always know what to say.
I know what hell I put you through over this.
I insist that you take this, as a small token of my gratitude.
Oh Bebe, really Look, Roz!
It's a gold Rolex!
Oh my goodness Bebe where did you get this?
Just don't wear it to the funeral.
Guest Starring RICHARD HAMILTON as Big Willy
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Go ahead, Tom.
I'm listening.
Hi, Dr. Crane.
Uh, it's about my girlfriend.
My problem is, I don't know if I love her for herself Or because things are so great between us physically.
Well, how long have you two been together?
Six years.
And the sex is still that good?
Oh man, Dr. Crane, every morning, night, three times a day on weekends.
But I'm not sure we have much else in common.
Well, common interests are of course the foundation of three times, you say?
Is that abnormal?
Well, uh, no, no, it's not abnormal.
It's not fair, but it's not abnormal.
Um, but you know, perhaps you share more things than you think you do actually.
I'll tell you what, try this: why don't you pick up a catalogue from a local university, go through it with her and see if there are any courses you'd like to take together?
That's a good idea!
Thanks, Doc.
Have a great weekend.
Well, I'd wish you the same but it hardly seems necessary.
Well, that's it for today, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health.
Niles called from the airport; he wants you to call him back.
He sounded frantic!
I'll call him from the car.
He's flying to a conference in Switzerland; I promised to talkhim through it.
Surely he's flown before?
Well, not coach!
Roz, is this the dress you're wearing to the wedding?
I have to, I'm a bridesmaid.
Is there a reason it has to be so, so?
Hideous?
It's supposed to be, so that way, the bride, By comparison, will glow!
Next to this baby, she'll light up like a bug zapper.
You know, of all my friends in Wisconsin, this girl was the last one I thought would beat me to the altar.
Not the Dairy State's comeliest chunk of cheddar?
Let's just say she works in her father's ice cream parlour and she eats her mistakes.
The groom's family makes cones.
Oh, well, we don't need Freud for that, do we?
The whole thing is just so depressing.
Lately everyone I know is settling down, getting married, having children.
What am I doing wrong?
Well, do you want me to answer as a friend, or a therapist?
As a friend!
See a therapist.
Frasier!
Well, Roz, I think your whole problem stems from some unresolved issues that cause you to choose the men you date.
Always flashy and superficial, offering no prospect of a lasting relationship.
Why would I do that?
Maybe fear of commitment, fear of being hurt.
But maybe it's time you started looking at different kinds of men.
You know, men who are more settled, a little less flash and more substance.
You're probably right, Frasier.
Hey, if I were smart, I'd go out with the next guy I see I'm not the least bit attracted to.
Roth, Roth, I juth bit my tongue.
Can you kith it and make it better?
The next one after him.
Oh, Doc, Doc.
Here's my video camera.
Oh, thank you, Bulldog.
What do you need it for?
Well, I'm going to record my father.
I'm going to have hislife on tape so Frederick can enjoy it in years to come.
What a good idea!
Whoa!
That's the ugliest thing I ever saw!
I'm going to a wedding.
Oh, I love weddings.
Never been to a wedding where I didn'tbag at least one bridesmaid.
And the uglier the dress, thequicker they want to get out of them.
This one would hit the floor before the rice!
I've got to get going.
Can you believe I actually have to be seen in public in this thing?
Well, Roz, it's only for a few hours.
After that you can donate it to the Salvation Army and one day make some Irish drag queen very happy.
What's the point of going to Switzerland without spending a day on the slopes?
So I ducked out of the conference and who should I run into, but Maris?
She'd just flown in for heryearly goat placenta treatments!
Good Lord, is it placenta treatment time again already?
We had a set-to on the slopes.
She ran, I tried to followher tracks in the snow, but alas, she made none.
Oh, dear What is it?
What's the matter?
I just spotted someone.
It's my least favorite patient.
The man's a compulsive womaniser.
He goes through so many women, he calls them all by the same odious nickname, "Sunshine," to avoid slip-ups.
Oh, God.
Frasier, what do you do when you don't like a patient?
Well, it's a tricky subject, isn't it?
How long have you been seeing him?
Six months.
We've made no progress whatsover.
Sometimes Ifeel he comes in not so much for help as to brag.
He claimsto have been with, at last count, one hundred and fifty women!
Oh puh-leease!
A hundred and fifty!
As if anything over, say seven weren't absurd.
Well, I would say eleven, but I get your point.
Oh, now serving one hundred and fifty-one.
Good God!
He's here to see Roz?
Yes, well, no doubt they met when Sealy Posturepedic named them Man and Woman of the Year.
Niles, you don't understand.
She-she'sbeen very vulnerable lately.
Well, I hope you'll forgive me if I don't stick around.
I'd like to leave before she makesintroductions.
I've got to warn her!
Warn her how?
What I just told you was in strict confidence, therapist to therapist.
You can't go repeating it!
But-but- No!
Oh of course, of course, you're right, I won't.
But that is the last man that Roz should be with!
Well, don't worry.
Knowing Roz, he won't be.
Hey, Frasier!
Oh, Roz!
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
This is Ben Collins.
Frasier Crane, pleasure.
Likewise.
Is it all right if we join you?
Oh, why not?
?
I'll grab our coffees.
He is the greatest guy!
You know, when I first met him, I thought, "He's not my type".
Then I remembered what you said.
And I'm so glad you gave me that advice, Frasier, because without it, I would never have given him a second look.
Well, Roz, let's not rule out that all-important third look.
Would you stop worrying about me, Frasier?
This one'sdifferent.
I can tell he really cares about me.
Here you go, Sunshine!
Why can't you be like other dogs?
Why can't you bring home bones or animals you kill?
Give me those!
Relax, I'm just going to put them with the roses you picked yesterday.
Oh hey, Dad!
Fresh from your walk?
I think now is as good a time as any to crank up the ol' camcorder.
Nah, maybe later.
Oh Dad, you've been saying "no" for weeks now!
Well, gee, some people would take that for a hint!
All you have to do is just sit here and talk about yourlife.
Life's got nothing to do with it!
This is about me dying and you having something to look at after I'm dead.
The wholething gives me the creeps!
I can't believe you're refusing to record your history, thestory that only you, Martin Crane, can tell, because it gives you the creeps!
OK then, I'll tell you the real truth.
My Indian heritage forbids it.
I'm afraid your magic box will rob me of my spirit.
I don't know why you're being so negative about this.
It'snot really for when you're dead.
It's for when you've lostyour mind.
Hey, Frasier.
Oh hello, Roz!
Why, after waiting for forty-five minutes, did I assume you'd forgotten our appointment?
Sorry, but uh I was on my way out, when Ben called.
Oh yes Ben.
Oh, what's with you?
Every time I bring him up, you make thatface.
I'm getting the sense that you don't like him that much.
It's just that I know something about Ben What?
He's a little old for you.
He's thirty-six!
Exactly my point!
When you were a freshman, he was a senior.
That never works out!
I'm getting my briefcase!
I'll go get a Coke.
Oh, hi, Daphne!
Hello, Roz.
How are you?
OK can I ask you something?
Does Frasier seem weird to you-?
Oh God, yes.
I haven't finished my question yet.
Yes, well, when you know the answer, it's hard not to hit thebuzzer.
Well, this is strange.
I mean, for the first time in years, I'm in a really solid relationship, and instead of being happy for me, Frasier seems upset.
Oh, that is odd.
Unless Unless what?
Well Dr. Crane is jealous of Benbecause he wants you for himself.
Huh?
Ohhh, no, no, no!
Yes, what else could it be?
Fra-Frasier?
What, you really think so?
Daphne, no!
No way!
No, he doesn't - Frasier is the one who told me to find myself a new boyfriend.
Someone who is settled, someone more nurturing, someone with substance over flash.
They could put that on Dr. Crane's tombstone.
Oh, come on!
No way!
Yes!
Wait, there's something else.
What?
I probably shouldn't tell you this.
But earlier this morning, Dr. Crane was on the phone with his brother and he said that your relationship with Ben was driving him crazy, and that he was dying to tell you but he can't.
Oh my God, did you hear him say that?
!
I certainly did!
Oh, this is too weird, this is too weird!
What am I going to say?
Maybe I won't say anything.
Maybe he'll just see how happy I am with Ben.
Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben!
My God, Roz, would you just drop it with Ben for a minute and pay some attention to me?
Oh-kaay!
Morning, Roz!
Hi, Frasier!
Hey, you look lovely, that colour's very flattering!
Thanks.
You know, I think this calls for a hug!
Oh, I don't look that good.
No, no, no, no, Roz.
Look!
My God, the ratings are in, and we did better in our timeslot this week than ever before!
Congratulations, partner!
Why don't we have dinner tonight, celebrate?
That sounds so fun but I kinda have plans.
I should have known.
Another time, perhaps.
Yeah sure, that sounds great.
Yo, Doc.
When are you going to return my video camera?
I got a hot date tonight and I want to record certain events for posterity, if you know what I mean.
Uh tomorrow, Bulldog.
Well, maybe tonight you could just have a police sketch artist crouch on your balcony.
So Mom, let me ask you something.
How long did you know Dad before you told him youloved him?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, you've been divorced fifteen years!
Let it go!
Listen, Ben is coming over to dinner tonight, and I think I'm going to tell him I love him.
I gotta work, bye!
Oh I'm, I'm sorry, Roz.
I should have knocked.
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK!
I couldn't help overhearing the last part of your conversation there.
You think you're not rushing things a little bit with Ben?
Are you really that serious?
Yes, I am.
But you know, there are a lot of men in the world.
And lots of women, too!
Well, that's more of a personal preference but I I meant for you!
Look, Frasier, what I'm trying to say is I know you have a problem with me and Ben, but we're happy together.
Well, it's just that you've only been going out for a month!
Well, sometimes, that's all it takes.
Fifteen seconds!
Listen Frasier, I'd like to think that there's some small part of you that is happy for me.
Afterall, it WAS your advice that got me this far!
Of course I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Me and my stupid advice will be with you for the next three hours, Seattle!
I'm not doing it, it's morbid.
It's not morbid.
And besides, if you don't do it, the only footage we'll have of you in the family archives is you pretending your stomach was a face that summer at the lake.
Alright Niles, if it'll shut you up, I'll do it.
Thanks, Dad!
We'll make this quick and easy.
Is that what you're wearing?
Forget it.
No, no no, all right.
Here we go, here we go.
OK My name's Martin Crane.
When I made this tape, I was sixty-four years old.
But now I'm DEAD!
Trapped in a box, underground Pretty scary, huh?
Dad, surely you must have some message you want to leave for the Cranes of the twenty-first century?
Alright, alright, I do.
Remember to always work hard, and that family comes first.
And I have a million bucks in unmarked bills that I took off a drug dealer that I have stashed in my old army foot locker.
The combination is left fifteen, right thirty-two, le-le Future generations: see what I had to put up with?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I suppose this means we're finished?
Well, unless you want future generations to see me go to the can!
Niles, actually I'm glad you're here.
I have to talk to youabout Roz.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've breached my ethics once already.
Niles, please, I've gotten desperate!
No, no, no!
Niles, she plans to tell him that she loves him tonight!
From what you told me about Ben's patterns, that will be the end of it and Roz will be shattered.
God, there has got to be some loophole in this confidentiality rule that will allow me to warn her and still preserve your ethics.
Niles!
Help me look through these textbooks!
No, I'll have no part in this!
Please, Niles!
Think of Roz!
I'm thinking of my license!
Well then, think of what Freud said!
"We are never so helplessly unhappy as when we lose love".
Oh, all right!
But that was dirty pool, using a Freud quotation.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's the Crane boys' kryptonite.
I know, I know.
Thank you.
Say, here's a possibility.
According to this, it says we can warn her if he means to do her bodily harm.
Does he?
No.
Damn!
It would be so much easier if Roz were mentally incompetent.
Go on Well, then there'd be some justification for protecting her.
Is she irrational?
She did attack a vending machine once, when a Twinkie came out of the Oreo chute.
Borderline, borderline.
Does she ever act delusional?
Well, she often claims that she is responsible for thesuccess of our show.
Building, building.
Does she display below-average intelligence?
She once ordered a bottle of white Zinfandel!
Jackpot!
Go to her, she's a threat to herself!
It's amazing they even let the woman drive!
Who is it?
It's Frasier!
Oh my God!
What happened?
He dumped me, Frasier!
Oh, oh, honey!
I - come here.
Oh God Everything was going great!
Until I said "I love you, Ben".
Then he got this look on his face, like he'd taken a wrong turn in a really bad neighbourhood!
He didn't even touch the champagne.
Oh I'm I'm sorry, Roz.
Here.
Thank you.
When you when you professed your love for him, uh were you dressed like that?
No!
After he left, I went in to change, and I saw all theseold bridesmaid dresses hanging in the closet.
And that's when it hit me.
That's what I am, a bridesmaid!
I might as well wear the uniform!
Oh Roz, no, no!
Now, now, come on!
Yes!
Come on!
Now look, look, you know, I find that whenever I'm low, it always lifts my spirits when I just spruce up a bit.
It wouldn't hurt to run a brush through your hair or through your teeth.
Oh God!
I must look awful!
No, no, not at all.
You're a big fat liar.
But you were right about Ben, and I just didn't see it.
What made you come over here anyway?
Well, actually, I was coming over here to take one last stab at convincing you that Ben was the wrong man for you.
You deserve someone better, Roz.
Oh, yeah, I'm a real catch!
Hell Oh, now, things really aren't all as dark as they seem.
You know, you're a-a beautiful, intelligent, desirable Why don't you let me just take a stab at that, will you?
I can't imagine any man not thinking himself the luckiest in the world to be with you.
You really do think that, don't you?
Yes, and I'm surprised you even had to ask me that.
I guess I didn't.
I've known that you've had these romanticfeelings toward me, for a while.
What?
Oh come on!
Don't deny it.
Those hints about finding someone with substance over style, the way you hated Ben.
And then Daphne told me she overheard you telling Niles that you couldn't stop thinking about me and wanted to tell me the truth!
Daphne told you that?
Yeah - don't be mad at her.
No, no, I'm not.
It's just that when she said that No it's OK, Frasier.
I'm glad she told me.
The only thingkeeping me from completely falling apart right now is knowing that someone like you could be interested in me.
Well, then there's no point in denying it, is there?
You know, maybe the idea of you and me isn't so crazy.
You are the kind of man I should be with!
Smart, gentle Ow!
I said gentle!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roz.
Uh, you know, it's just that there are so many I know, I know.
Workplace romances always fail.
Exactly my point!
And I'm on the rebound.
I've got to give myself time toheal.
Yes yes, lots of time.
On the other hand, you are the one who always says the best relationships start with friendship.
Well, I do say that, yes.
It's true, but And we're friends, aren't we?
We're very good friends.
Right now we are both free.
Oh well, in my case, painfully free.
You know, maybe if we both went into it with our eyes open?
Oh no, what am I saying?
My relationship with you is probably the healthiest one I've ever had with a man!
I don't want to screw that up.
Now that you mention it, my relationship with you isprobably the best one I've ever had with a woman!
Not that it's been much of a horse race, but To friendship?
Here's hoping the next time you tell a man you love him, he says it back.
Well, let's see.
I love you, Frasier.
I love you too, Roz.
You gonna be alright?
Yeah.
Well, I'd better run.
Yeah, my saying "I love you" seems to have that effect onmen.
No, no, I'll-I'll stay if you like!
No, no.
Don't you worry about me.
I will not be alone.
I will be sliding into a hot tub with my good friends, Ben & Jerry.
See you tomorrow, Roz.
See you, Frasier.
Guest Callers DAVID DUCHOVNY as Tom
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
You got something on your mind?
It's Joe.
Tonight's our six-month anniversary, but we can't celebrate until next week because he's flying to Las Vegas with his buddies.
Oh, Vegas, huh?
Great!
Well, tell him not to miss the show at the Diamond Lounge: a Topless History of the World!
If they've still got the same Bathsheeba he's in for a real treat!
Oh yes, that's just where I want Joe spending our anniversary, some smutty show in Vegas!
No, it's very tasteful and historically accurate.
Except at the end, where Eleanor Roosevelt and Eva Braun settle World War Two by wrestling in pudding.
Hello, Dr. Crane.
Daphne.
Oh, Niles.
To what do we owe this pleasure?
To an unscrupulous art dealer who's trying to rob me blind.
Last night, I was at a gallery opening, and Niles, is this going to be a long story?
Moderately.
Walk-and-talk.
Anyway, I was at this opening, in conversation, when I made a rather emphatic point about pointillism, when I lost the grip on my canap and found that it became airborne!
Well, the next thing I know I'm being confronted by an irate gallery owner who's demanding I reimburse him for the damage to one of his paintings!
How he could notice a fleck of foie gras on a Jackson Pollock is beyond me.
He's getting an estimate, and just to protect myself, I seem to recall you knowing a trustworthy art restorer?
Oh yes, I do, actually.
Saved my life last year when Eddie licked my Liechtenstein!
I'll get you his card.
Oh, thank you.
You free for lunch today?
Oh, sadly, no.
The radio station is subjecting my program to something they call a "focus group" this afternoon.
Dinner, perhaps?
Oh, perfect.
And what exactly is a focus group?
Well, they actually drag a pack of people off the street and make them listen to my program, and then dutifully record their opinions about it.
How demeaning!
Oh, absolutely.
Can you imagine Sigmund Freud being dragged into a roomful of Viennese laymen to hear remarks like, "hate that Oedipal thing, but, oh, love the penis envy"!
I mean, really!
The worst thing is that they may change my show in deference to the opinion of Joe Six-Pack!
You're worrying too much.
I was on a focus group once.
That sound you hear is a nail being hammered into my coffin.
They were trying out a new frozen snack.
It was a meatball with the cheese injected right in the middle.
Just as nature intended.
Dr. Niles Crane.
Ah.
So, you have the estimate?
What?
Four thousand dollars, to remove a miniscule gobbet of duck liver?
!
I could do the same thing with a Q-tip and some club seltzer!
Oh well, you may very well say "pay up or else," but I have something to say to you?
Yeah, well at least I wasn't fooling around with the babysitter!
Shut up!
No, you shut up!
Oh please, I have enough aggravation without having to listen to a stupid talk show!
I swear, the only life forms lower than the people who appear on those shows are the ones who watch them!
Like me?
What?
Oh no, I didn't realize?
No, no, no, that's quite all right.
Although I do find it interesting that I get criticized for listening to people's problems, when all you do is get rich from it.
Surely, Daphne, even you can see the difference between cheap sensationalism and the practice of psychiatry.
Oh, "even me"?
As in, "even feeble-minded Daphne"?
!
Well, I'll tell you what I can tell the difference between: a true gentleman and a condescending prig!
I am NOT!
He said priggishly.
Forgive me if I'm not as down to earth as you and your tattooed, muu-muu wearing brethren!
You pompous twit!
Couch zombie!
Snob!
Brat!
Oh, shut up!
No, YOU shut up!
I'm glad we turned off the TV.
Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry!
I'm just so upset at Joe!
I didn't mean a word of it!
Daphne, I apologize?
Oh no, it was my fault?
I called you a couch zombie?
No, please?
Friends?
Oh, of course.
Niles, what was that all about?
I'm not sure.
But, oh, mama, it was glorious!
Blood-pounding, sarcastic zingers flying!
Are you saying you that enjoyed fighting with Daphne?
Every exhilarating moment!
It was pure, unbridled passion!
I think I still have some of her spittle on my forehead!
Oh, why did Dad ever tell us not to fight with girls?
It's wonderful!
The friction between us?
Niles, is this going to be a long description?
Very!
Walk-and-talk.
By showering a reluctant girlfriend with gifts, Billy, you're applying a band-aid to a gaping wound.
My advice is to find someone who will return your worthy affection, or your wallet, as well as your bed, will be empty.
I see we're out of time.
Thank you for listening.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health.
OK, let's talk about Dr. Crane's show.
Oh, I know you've been eyeing this two-way mirror, but the other people behind there are data consultants, so please speak freely.
There's no one involved with the show whose feelings could be hurt.
If anybody says anything bad about me, I'll kill myself!
Now, Roz, relax.
We do a perfectly good show.
We're not going to change it one iota.
Only a fool would listen to the opinion of every Tom, Dick, and Harry.
I liked everything about it.
On the other hand, it's good to keep an open mind.
I like that Roz.
I think her voice is really sexy, especially that throaty laugh of hers.
Wow, that's nice.
I didn't know I had a throaty laugh.
You do.
I've noticed it too.
Really?
Oh, you.
The stuff he says really seems to make a lot of sense.
Yeah, it's funny.
I mean, he takes his callers seriously, but he can kid around with them too.
Yeah, I listen to a lot of radio, and I think this is a great show.
Well, I just don't know how much more of this I can listen to!
Manu, I notice you've been quiet.
Uh, do you have something to say?
Me?
No.
We'd like to hear your opinion of the program.
Well, it I don't know.
Something about I don't like it.
Well, who is this cheeky nonconformist?
Well, let's see, his name is Manu Habib, married, no children, owns his own newsstand.
Wow, that is so weird, to hear someone's whole life summed up like that.
"Roz Doyle, Radio Producer, single".
Well, getting back to your thoughts, Manu, you said there was something about the program you didn't like.
Can you be more specific.
I don't like him.
Why?
I don't know.
I just don't like him.
Oh, I do.
I'm gonna start listening to him all the time.
It's a great show.
My God, Frasier, this is a love-fest!
I can't believe we were even worried about it.
"I just don't like him".
Hmm Well, looks like our coffee's here.
Why don't we take a quick break, OK?
Hey, sports fans!
How's it going in here?
Bulldog, I thought they were testing your show across the hall?
Oh, yeah, they are.
But after ten minutes it's just the same-old, same-old.
Guys love me, chicks pretend not to.
Whoa, your group's even uglier than mine!
Would you knock it off?
These people happen to like us.
Oh, will you guys lighten up?
You got to get in the spirit of things.
Hey, hey!
This is great, I live for a moment like this.
That's right, that's right, go for it, right there, right there.
Bulldog?
As long as you're in there you might as well go after the Huevos Rancheros you had for breakfast!
Oh, stop it!
Hey, ten bucks says he eats what he finds.
Oh, that's disgusting!
Come on, come on, come on, come o BINGO!
Do I know these people or what?
!
Hi, Niles.
Hey, Dad.
May I assume from your dress windbreaker that you'll be joining us for dinner?
Yep, but I'm making a pitch that we eat at the Timber Mill.
I got a coupon from there that expires tomorrow.
Oh.
If I dine there tonight, so may I. Hello, Dr. Crane.
Oh, there's the British bobcat!
Now, look, she's still a little bit over the edge about this Joe thing.
So you better watch your step or you're gonna have a repeat of this morning.
We wouldn't want that, would we?
Chips, Daphne?
Was that wise?
What do you mean?
You know what they say, "many chips make for chunky hips".
Waddle, waddle, waddle!
Have you lost your mind?
!
Oh, no, no, I'm glad if I put on a few pounds.
Now maybe Joe will stop nagging me to plump up!
Hey, Fras, how was the focus group?
Fine, I guess.
Oh, well, you said yourself they didn't mean anything.
Yes, well, it's one thing to say that.
It's another to sit there being personally attacked!
One man actually said, "I just don't like him".
Only one?
I'm sure someone must have said something nice.
Well, all the other eleven had nothing but high praise.
Eleven out of twelve liked you?
You should be thrilled!
F..
DR didn't have that kind of approval rating.
Yes, or Churchill for that matter.
Churchill that cigar-chomping gin blossom with a face attached!
You're right about that.
There's a kiss hello to put you off your tea.
I wish I was able to talk to this man and ask him what it is about me that he doesn't like.
But, I-I can't, you see, he was told that his comments would be kept confidential.
Just forget it.
Come on, let's go out to dinner.
I'm buying.
Well, what is it he doesn't like about me?
My voice, my manner, do I intimidate him?
I don't know!
What is it about you?
Everybody has to love you!
Just like when you were in that play in high school.
You get standing ovations every night, all your friends say you're great, you got one lousy review in the school paper and you sulked for a week.
Well, you know, Dad, I'd like to think I've matured a bit since then.
But, you know, you would have sulked too, if you'd read in the paper, "Mr. Crane's attempts to gyrate his hips as Conrad, the teen idol in 'Bye-Bye, Birdie,' made this reviewer say, 'Bye-bye, breakfast!
'" That review was a mash note compared to my first draft.
I know just what you're going through.
I once won a dance competition hands down, but instead of celebrating I spent the whole night fretting over my one bad score.
Silly-head!
Idiot.
Oh, I've stepped in it now!
Listen here, Dr. Crane?
Yeah, Daphne?
All right now, Daphne, just a moment!
Just try to remember what you're like when you're arguing with Joe.
Consider Niles's situation.
He's separated.
You can't imagine the emotional see-saw he's on.
Not to mention the fact that he may be unaware that he's acting like a complete jackass!
Of course, you're right.
I'm sorry, I should be more sensitive.
From now on, nothing you say can make me cross with you.
I suppose I had that coming.
Though I think "jackass" was a tad over the line.
Well, just consider it payback for the headline, "Crane's 'Birdie' Lays An Egg"!
All right, now, Fras, you got to let it go.
You know, no matter who you are, no matter what you do, you can't please everyone.
I suppose my negative baggage is just a pound or two over the weight limit.
O.K., good, come on, let's go have dinner.
This is good!
This is healthy!
I'm letting go!
There he is.
The man who doesn't like me.
I knew we should have taken two cars.
What the hell is the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Dad.
It's just that "I just don't like him," it's not specific enough.
Why doesn't he like me?
What difference does it make?
Well, if his point was valid, I would do something about it.
If it's not, well, then I could dismiss it.
Fine, go talk to him.
I can't.
He's not supposed to know I was part of the focus group.
You, Dad!
You could go talk to him for me.
Oh, for crying out loud?
Look, if we're going to be here for a while, could we at least lock the doors?
Relax, Niles, the neighborhood's O.K. The docks are two blocks from here!
So's the Ritz-Carleton.
Exactly!
We're caught halfway between heaven and hell.
All I want is more information.
Dad, please?
Please go talk to him for me?
All right, if I get an answer for you, can we go to dinner?
O.K., fine.
Oh, but wait, wait, wait!
Now you can't just walk up there and ask him.
He'll know that I sent you.
Got to find some artful way of introducing the subject.
Can we at least hide Dad's handicapped sign?
It sends a clear signal that we're incapable of fighting back!
So do your suspenders.
All right, I've got it, I've got it.
You're a business man in town from Chicago.
No, no, it's too obvious.
Uh, from Cleveland.
No would ever pretend to be from Cleveland.
Fine, then we eat.
Wait, wait, we're not through yet!
Yes, you've had a bad sales month, and you're a little depressed.
You happen to see an add for my show on the side of a bus, and you were wondering if I'm as intelligent as I look.
What?
Oh, just word it your own way.
Are we clear on this now?
All right, I got it.
Businessman, Cleveland, depressed, then eat!
Yes, Dad, eat!
Honestly, sometimes you can get so obsessed about things!
Oh, God, it's raining!
Hi, I'm Marty Crane.
My son's Dr. Frasier Crane.
He's across the street in that BMW.
No, don't look!
Oh, my God.
He was behind the mirror.
Look, don't worry about it.
He's not mad at you.
He just want to know why you don't like him.
But I do like him.
No, you don't.
Oh, yes, I do!
No, he heard what you said.
They lied to me.
They lied about..
They lied about the mirror, they lied about the free gift.
If that's a tod back, what the hell is funny pack Look, I just need you to be more specific What don't you like him about.
I can't do this.
I don't like to say bad things about people, and you are his father?
No, you'd be doing me a favor!
Just answer this one question, and we'll all get out of your life forever.
you're promising?
Absolutely.
All right.
I-I don't know your son well.
But, uh, I guess I find him, uh, just a little bit annoying.
Yeah?
Annoying.
O.K. You did good.
Thanks.
Please tell your son I'm sorry that he annoys me so much.
Will do.
Not yet not yet not yet.
OK, unlock!
And lock!
Mission accomplished.
Good.
Did he believe my story?
Oh, yeah, I had him going pretty good.
That Cleveland thing really sold it.
Well, we better go eat now, huh?
Before he sees us again.
Right.
So, uh, Dad, what doesn't he like about me?
He said you annoy him.
Yes, how so?
Well, I didn't ask him.
What do you mean you didn't ask him?
Oh, geez!
I'm sorry, Dad, but I have no idea what "he's annoying" means!
Well, it's clear enough to me!
Frasier, not to appear unsympathetic but I had my i'm dangerous space on so long it's starting to hurt.
oh, what is about me he couldn't find so annoying.
well, he mentioned something about not letting old man to eat!
I'm just going to have to do this myself!
Here.
Thank you.
Who're you calling?
No one.
I just pressed 911, and I'm keeping my finger poised over the Send button in case there's trouble with those hooligans.
Oh, the UPS men or the little girls playing in the puddle?
Hello.
Hello.
I can help you?
Uh, yes, yes, you were recently speaking with a salesman from Cleveland.
I don't think so.
It was just five minutes ago.
He left you and went over to that car waiting right over there.
You see?
Oh, God, no.
You're him, it's you.
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm so sorry, I really don't mean to bother you but I would like to talk to you for a minute.
I like your show.
Oh, no.
I like your show, and I like you.
That man was my father I like your father!
Oh, that's very nice of you, but you see, you told him that, uh, you find me annoying.
Yes, yes, you did, and that's all right.
I don't mind constructive criticism.
It's just that I wish you could be a bit more specific.
What exactly is it about me that you find so annoying?
You're not annoying.
Yes, I am!
Would I be here if I wasn't?
Well, I have enjoyed talking to you very much, but it's time for my break.
Oh, no, no, please!
I'm so sorry.
I am a sticky mess.
Let me help you with that.
No, no, no, no, it's fine, good.
Manu?
Drive safe.
Oh, dear God!
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?
Let me look at it, let me look at it?
No, no!
Look, I am a doctor.
No, no, I just go to the restaurant to put ice on it.
Right, you know, I'll hold down the fort here!
Glad to be of help!
He's crushed the gentleman's hand, and now he appears to be commandeering his newsstand.
Uh-huh.
Oh, good lord.
Smoking in the worst places!
How much for the paper?
Ah, yes, uh, well, that would be oh, fifty cents.
Thank you so much.
There we are.
Scuse me, are you Dr. Crane from the radio?
Why, yes, I am.
Oh, I just never miss your show!
I love you!
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Oh, occupational hazard.
Oh, would you mind?
Oh, I wouldn't mind at all.
To Amanda.
Amanda, it's a pleasure.
What are you doing here, anyway?
Oh, oh, well you see, let me explain, you see.
The, uh, radio station conducted a little audio survey today, and although the response was favorable from eleven out of twelve of the participants?
Is that smoking?
Well, some people might consider it smoking, but you see, for me?
FIRE!
Oh, my God!
oh my god Frasier set his newsstand on fire.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, may I?
Look, I know there's nothing I can say right now that would make you feel any better, but rest assured, I will be financially responsible for everything.
All this because you had to know why I do not like you.
Well, you were kind of vague.
You want to know why?
I'll tell you why.
I think you are a smarty-pants.
I was too polite to say that before.
But then you spied on me, you stalked me, you badgered me, you poured Yoo-Hoo down my Dockers, you crunched my hand, and then, as if all that was not enough, you burned down my newsstand, my livelihood, a gift to me from my beloved uncle, may he rest in peace!
Was that so hard?
Special Guest Star TONY SHALHOUB as Manu
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health.
Happy anniversary!
Oh, Roz!
Oh, this is so much fun, Roz!
I got you one too!
Oh, thank you!
O.K., you first.
I mean, it's nothing really, it's not expensive or anything, you probably won't even like it, I'm not good with gifts?
Look, don't oversell it, Roz.
It's a tape.
"The Dr. Frasier Crane Show: Show #1, May 21st, 1993".
It's our first broadcast.
Oh, Roz!
I can't wait to listen to it!
Did you ever think I'd stay on the air this long?
Oh, hell no.
"To Roz, who believed in me from the start".
Yes, it's from Hallmark's "Irony" section.
Oh, Frasier, they're beautiful!
Earrings!
Thank you, thank you!
You deserve them.
Working side by side for three years, one can't help but become close friends.
And they're blue!
To match your lips when they're cold!
Oh, Mum, it's not that I don't want to come home.
I'd love a visit!
It's just that I can't!
He won't let me.
Oh, you have no idea what Dr. Crane is like.
Why, he's an absolute beast unpleasant to be around, a real tyrant!
Oh!
It's just my mum.
I'm trying to get out of a visit home.
Oh, I understand.
All right.
No, I'm not exaggerating!
He treats me like a bloody slave!
Daphne!
Where's my dressing gown?
!
Not to mention how cheap he is!
That better not be a long-distance call!
Yeah, yeah.
He does sound a lot like Aunt Lillian.
I got to run, Mum.
Love you, bye.
I'm sorry, you must think I'm a terrible daughter.
No, not at all.
I think you're a terrible liar, Daphne, but a perfectly run-of-the-mill daughter.
It's just that I only get one vacation a year, and I want to go somewhere fun, like Acapulco.
Well, that makes sense.
And going home is just so flipping boring.
It's always the same.
There's a wonderful reunion at the airport, and we share all our news on the way home in the car.
And by the time I've dropped off my suitcase, we've exhausted all conversation, and that's when I realize I've got a whole week left with nothing to look forward to but Dad telling the story of how he once shared a cigar with Winston Churchill during the blackouts ?
he thinks!
Well, it sounds like an easy decision, Daphne ?
Hasta luego.
Oh, Dr. Crane, why is it so easy to love our families, yet so hard to like them?
Well, Daphne, that is one of those questions that make life so rich and psychiatrists richer.
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just go call a travel agent, see which guilt trip is more expensive.
Good afternoon, Seattle.
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.
If you can feel, I can heal.
Fasten your seat belt, Eddie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
Hello.
You're on the air with Dr. Frasier Crane.
"Put your head in my hands".
"Little owlet in the glen, I am ashamed of you, You are ungrammatical in speaking as you do, You should say, 'to whom, to whom,' not 'to who, to who.
' Your little friend, Miss Katydid, may be green, 'tis true, But you never heard her say?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Roz Doyle, your new producer.
What?
Producer?
Dr. Crane, I presume?
Yes, yes, but, uh, where's Dave?
Uh, he got another assignment.
But I was comfortable with Dave.
Look, Dr. Crane, I know you've been thrown a curve, but everything's gonna be fine.
But I did a mock show with Dave.
I did mock-call-in's, mock commercials, mock news bulletins!
Look, I got a bulletin for you: Dave's out, I'm in, and stop saying "mock".
All right, look, Miss Doyle, I'm sure you're quite capable, but Dave has fifteen years of experience.
I'd really prefer that he do it.
Well, that would make two of us then, wouldn't it?
I really think I should call management and ask for Dave, it's not really fair to Dave or to me.
Dr. Crane, Dave dumped you.
Why?
We were here until 2 A.M. this morning, as I explained to Dave in meticulous detail my philosophy of optimal mental health!
It's a mystery, all right.
O.K., look, I'm going to screen a few calls, and No!
No, no, as I explained to Dave before, there will be no call-screening.
You see, I want my show to be fresh and spontaneous, and call screening squelches all of that.
And the mystery of Dave's departure deepens.
OK, you're on in five seconds, I'll give you a cue.
Good afternoon, Seattle.
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.
"If you can feel, I can heal".
Let's see who's on line one!
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
"You're on the couch".
No, I'm not.
Well, I meant on the metaphorical couch.
I'm in a beanbag chair, O.K.?
Uh, moving on then, um, how can I help you?
It's about my husband Look, I-I just can't do this, it's really too embarrassing for me.
No, no, please, please, dear friend, you must - I'm really here to help you.
Please, go ahead.
I've tried, and I've tried, and I just don't know what to do about this!
Well, you know, often in these cases, it helps if you restate your problem.
But this time, try boiling it down to one succinct sentence.
Now, how would you do that?
My husband is dead!
Well, perhaps we should go back to the wordy version.
Uh, we'll be right back after these Important messages.
Of course I could do a gardening show.
If I can grow plants in my dorm room closet, I must know a thing or two about horticulture?
Are you trying to get transferred?
Bye!
Look, Dr. Crane, I got to be honest with you here.
It's just that I-I think psychiatry is, just, uh, sort of - kind of bull!
Oh, well, this is a match made in heaven then, isn't it?
!
Oh, don't be offended.
"Don't be offended".
Why should I be offended?
In the last week, I've uprooted myself from my home of fifteen years, moved all the way across the country away from everything I care about, and plunged myself into a frightening new career!
The first few nerve-wracking moments, I walk in here and find my producer lobbying to get herself transferred to another show!
Abe Lincoln had a brighter future when he picked up his tickets at the box office!
O.K., you got to make the caller get to the point, and then for God's sake, so should you.
Duly noted.
O.K. Number twenty-four You know what, you're starting to glaze.
We can go through the rest of this tomorrow.
See you, Frasier.
Bye, Roz.
Oh, excuse me.
Well, excuse you.
Oh, Niles!
Oh, Frasier!
What a serendipitous event.
How did you discover my favorite coffee bar?
Well, the radio station's right across the street.
I did my first show today.
Yes, you did, didn't you?
Well good to see you, have a nice day!
Niles, aren't you going to join me?
Oh, well, I would, but I have a routine.
I come in every day, order coffee and spend some quality time with myself, you understand.
Niles, I've seen you once in the last two years.
Oh, that is your point.
Well very well, in the spirit of blood being thicker than water, why don't we?
I remember your fourth birthday party.
Grandmother took us to the park to ride the carousel, and made all those little children wait while you wiped off your painted pony.
I was wearing Bermuda shorts and that saddle was slick with toddler sweat.
Well, uh oh, uh, thanks again for dinner the other night with Maris.
You two seem very happy.
Oh yes, it's love.
Like the Arctic Puffin, we've mated for life.
Honestly, I can't imagine even looking at another woman.
Excuse me, sir, have you finished with that sugar?
Oh, yes.
You ready to order?
Uh, yes.
Double decaf non-fat latte, mmm medium foam, dusted with just the faintest whisper of cinnamon.
I'll have a black coffee.
You'll have to forgive my brother.
He just came in on the noon stage.
I hope I never see the day when I am so frightfully pretentious that a good-old cup of American coffee isn't good enough for me.
So, how'd your visit with Dad go?
I haven't been to see him yet.
Really?
You've been in town a whole week.
Well, I've been very busy, what with settling into the new apartment, unpacking Frasier, you're obviously making excuses.
I'm going over tonight for my weekly visit, why don't you come along?
Geez, I know I should, Niles.
But I'm really in such a vulnerable state right now.
The last thing I need is Seattle's reigning sourpuss taking potshots at me.
Is that what you're worried about?
Yes!
Well, you have been out of touch.
Our father's a changed man.
Ever since he was shot, he's softened, with a whole new zest for life!
Niles, I visited him in the hospital.
He made his roommate cry, and the man was in a coma.
Dad was still in shock.
The change came after.
As a psychiatrist surely you've seen this?
A patient has a brush with death and rediscovers his love of life.
Ah, the laughs we've had when I'm over there.
I sometimes wonder if that bullet didn't crease his funny bone.
Oh thank you.
Can you believe the incompetence of that man?
I very clearly asked for a whisper of cinnamon, he's given me a full-throated shout!
There are countries in this world where they would lop off his sprinkling hand!
You know, I'd forgotten what a weird little person you are.
Dad is going to be positively giddy when he sees that he's got the both of us tonight.
Who is it?
Niles, and a special guest!
Oh, jeez all right, hold your horses.
How does he come up with those?
Look, Dad, it's Frasier!
Well, I can see that.
That punk didn't shoot out my eyeball.
Stop it!
He sees the humor in everything.
Frasier, come on in.
Thanks, Dad.
So, big game?
Nah, they're losing again.
Pitcher's a bum.
He's a bum, he's an absolute hobo!
Isn't that right, Skipper?
Niles, are you drunk?
Don't be ridiculous!
Seeing the three of us back together again in the same room who needs alcohol for that?
I do.
I do.
I'll get you a beer.
Thanks, Dad.
You filthy liar!
You said he'd changed!
Well, it got you here, didn't it?
I've been dealing with him all by myself ever since Mom died.
Now it's your turn, so welcome home, prodigal son!
You guys want some pork rinds?
And that's as close as you're going to get to a fatted calf.
No, thanks, Dad.
Oh, will you stop staring at me?
Here you go.
Ah, well, I understand completely, Frasier.
Dad, Frasier was just saying that he'd like to spend some quality time with you alone, so I'm just going to slip out.
All right, suit yourself.
All right oh, you haven't met Eddie.
Eddie?
Frasier is the firstborn.
The torch has been passed.
So How was your flight?
Oh, actually, I drove.
You take the I-Ninety?
Uh, Eighty.
Should have taken Ninety, it would have got you here faster.
Darn.
So, Dad, did you listen to my show today?
No, I missed it.
Sorry.
That's all right.
How'd it go?
Well, uh, kind of rocky.
Spent a good part of the day puzzling over the proper signature line to use to introduce myself.
Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something.
Well, you know, I'm looking for something that's familiar but not a clich you know, something that's memorable but not too gimmicky You know, it doesn't really matter if it's got something to ad, please, I'm trying to have a conversation, it's hard with the TV on.
Well, I just want to get the score, O.K.?
I'm trying to describe to you my dilemna with that phrase?
All right, fine, I'm listening.
Are you happy?
I'm listening.
That's it!
"I'm listening"!
That's fabulous!
Have you got a pencil somewhere?
Yeah, there's one in the kitchen on the table.
"I'm listening".
Dad - oh, I love that!
Uh, look, I hate to cut this short, but I told some guys I'd meet 'em down at Duke's.
You're leaving?
Yeah.
Whenever you're ready, I'll walk you out.
Dad, I haven't seen you in two years, I stopped by and you're leaving in ten minutes?
Oh, why don't we stop kidding ourselves?
You don't really want to be here, and we don't really have anything to talk about.
At least I'm making the effort.
Oh, yeah ?
it's an effort to talk to me, huh?
Well, I guess that's why you only bother coming home once a year at Christmas.
Oh no, wait!
Sorry, I take that back.
Last year you went to Arugalah, wherever the hell that is.
Dad, you know you're painting an awfully bleak picture here.
Ever since I moved to Boston, I've come home at least three or four times a year.
It's just lately things got a little hectic, and I haven't been able to come home as often.
Yeah I noticed how busy you got after your mother died.
But, what the hell, I didn't go visit you in Boston either, did I?
So, uh, why don't we just drop this?
No.
The point is that we're here now, together.
I don't want this night to end before we've at least tried to have one real conversation.
Will you at least try, Dad?
Will you just sit down with me for a while and let's try, please?
So, uh, you know, I'd forgotten how much it really does rain here.
You get used to it.
Makes things green.
Yeah where would the old earth be without rain?
My darling, I would have thought that old fascination would wear off by now.
Well, hello, there!
Hey!
Oh, hey, guys.
Frasier, Dad tells me you've been on the air three years today, so we'd like to take you out for a celebratory dinner.
Well, thank you.
Dad, how did you know?
Well, I heard that woman who called in.
You listened to my show?
Well, I sort of I feel asleep during the Mariners' game but when I woke up, you were on.
And you didn't turn me off.
I did not!
I listened to you for ten minutes before I finally dozed off again.
Faint praise, and yet it thunders in my ears!
Hello, Dr. Crane.
Hey, Daphne, we're going out to dinner.
You want to join us?
Oh, thanks, but no.
I promised myself that tonight I'd decide what I'm doing on my vacation ?
either home to the family or to sunny Acapulco.
I may just squeeze into my bikini and let my hips make the decision.
Of course, it would be more memorable if we celebrated at home, just for a?
Let's go, let's go!
Have a lovely time!
Oh, fellas, hold the elevator for me.
All right.
Daphne?
I was just thinking about our discussion earlier this afternoon, and I've decided to give you an extra week off.
That way you can go to Manchester, and Acapulco.
Oh, that's so sweet!
You really must think I should go home.
Well, I've just realized that being part of a family is really worth the effort.
And very often the effort means you'll need a week in Acapulco, so Thank you, Dr. Crane.
You're welcome.
I guess if I try a little harder, it won't be so bad.
Well, that's a good way of thinking.
You know, things can get better.
Hey, let's go!
I got acid burning a hole in my stomach!
Still would you mind leaving those brochures of Acapulco out for me?
