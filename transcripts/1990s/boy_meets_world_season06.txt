{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously, and absolutely unbelievably, on Boy Meets World We're having a baby!
You're having a baby?
I'm retiring.
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Feeny said I should go to Yale unless I have a really good reason not to.
Well, there isn't any good reason.
Actually, there is.
Ladies and gentlemen, the John Adams High School class of 1998.
Will you marry me?
Cory?
Did I just ask you to marry me?
I asked you.
But I always thought I'd be the one to propose.
Well, I beat you to it.
Look, Cory, if you want to be the one No, no, no, no.
This is the '90s.
What's done is done.
So, okay, you proposed.
Hey, we better get to that graduation party.
I'd like an answer, Cory.
And I'm going to give it to you.
But, you know, Topanga, it's not every day that a guy gets asked a question like that, and it's not every day I can give you an So you got a ring for me, or what?
Topanga, listen.
I want to be with you more than anything in the world, okay?
But I cannot let you give up Yale for me.
Do you honestly want me to go to Yale?
No.
Then shut up about it.
Pennbrook is a great school.
I'm going to get a great education.
Besides, what good is college without this face?
It's no good.
It's no good at all.
So when do you want to do it?
Do what?
Get married, Cory.
Topanga, I don't know.
I haven't even had time to think How about right away?
Right away?
Right away when?
Cory, we've been dating each other since we were 2.
We've both had a chance to be with other people.
Yeah, I wonder what she's doing.
Do you think we'll be together for the rest of our lives?
Yeah, I know we will.
So do I. We're not like other people, Cory.
We're weird.
Let's just do it.
Plus, I want to have time for our honeymoon before college starts.
A honeymoon, huh?
Mmm-hmm.
And on this honeymoon, you and I, we'd probably Oh, there's a good chance, yeah.
A good chance.
Keep talking.
Let's go tell your parents.
No!
I mean, no, I don't think we should tell my parents.
They're going through a lot right now with the baby coming and everything, and I don't know if they'd understand.
In fact, they're incapable of understanding.
I don't think we should tell anyone.
You know, until we've figured out what we're going to do.
Cory, you do want to marry me, don't you?
Yeah.
I just I don't want everyone sticking their noses in our business.
You know, I mean, this is our lives.
This is for us to decide.
Okay, promise you won't tell a soul.
Okay, I promise.
I kind of like it.
It's very Romeo and Juliet.
That's why we're not telling anyone.
Whatever you need.
So are we engaged, or what?
Yeah, if you don't open up your big mouth.
You.
Congratulations, you two.
Oh, my God, he knows.
Cory, Mr. Feeny is congratulating us on graduating, so, uh, why don't you thank him?
Is there something else?
Nothing.
Get off my back!
Whatever you say.
You're a smug one, aren't you, George, huh?
You know you know, I know you know.
I don't know how you know, but I know that you know.
All right, I know.
I know everything.
Now, what in the world are you talking about?
Nothing.
This gets out, I'll hunt you down like a dog!
How you doing?
Topanga asked you to marry her.
I hate you.
You guys are so weird.
I know, but I love him, and I want to be with him till he dies.
But you can't tell anyone, not even Shawn.
Feeny told you, didn't he?
I'm going to find him and rip him apart!
I was sitting right next to you, you dope.
I heard everything.
That's why he looked so scared.
I don't think he was scared.
I just think he was a little flustered.
I was a little flustered, that's all.
You looked like somebody shot you in the head.
But, hey, I don't blame you.
You know, if Angela asked me that in the middle of my graduation, I'd wet my gown, too.
Girl, at our age, we are supposed to be having fun, not getting married.
What idiot doesn't know that?
Marry her.
What?
I think you should marry her.
Shawn, that's not what you're supposed to say.
You're supposed to say that you think we're crazy.
Well, you're crazy if you think you haven't been married to her your entire life.
You might as well get presents.
Well, I do need a new toaster, but no.
No.
Rushing into marriage right now is way too overwhelming, what with high school ending, college starting.
And you're scared to tell your parents.
Well, I see no reason why they ever have to know.
Well, if we're done talking about you, I've got some news.
Well, we're not done talking about me.
How selfish are you?
Cor I think I'm going to take some courses at Pennbrook.
Good.
Have a nice day.
Which means that I'm going to be living in the dorms, so if you're not ready to have Topanga as a roommate Wait, you and me together?
That's two proposals on the same day, Shawn.
I I must be the luckiest boy in the world.
Well, Shawnie Yeah.
I'm glad you decided to go to college, bud.
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
What's he talking about?
Yeah, I'm going to take some college courses.
I love my job, but there's more to life than photographing naked ladies.
Oh, hey, that's great, buddy.
You're going to college.
All right.
There's no more to life than naked ladies.
Except maybe naked ladies that wear really tight shirts and really tight pants.
Look, I'm proud of you, okay?
Problem with you is you don't know how to be supportive, okay?
I want you to be supportive.
Sorry.
I'll try.
You know, this means Shawn and I are going to be roommates.
What?
I support that.
Unbelievable.
I support that.
I don't believe you.
I'm so proud of you!
Yeah, that's great.
All right.
Good job.
Please don't move out.
Hey, school doesn't start for two months.
You guys should have plenty of time to find a new roommate.
Cannot be done!
We are very particular.
We got strict requirements.
I give up a scholarship to Yale to move to Philadelphia with you, and you tell me you're going to Corpus Christi to find yourself?
You know what?
Find this.
She pretty.
That a lot of woman.
"Find this.
" God, that doesn't even make any sense, does it?
I think you did a wonderful job, and I support you.
You know, and I really thought that we loved each other.
And now I have no place to stay.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Oh, man, I don't envy you.
What's all my stuff doing out in the hallway?
Oh, yeah.
We found a new roommate.
Get out.
Here, I'll help.
School doesn't start for two months.
Well, the funny thing is we found someone who meets every one of our strict requirements.
I'm going to have to tell this guy that he can't move in here till I'm good and ready to move out.
Hey, do you guys have any toothpaste I could borrow?
Hi.
Let me help you here.
Yeah, just grab something and chuck it right out the door there.
There you go.
Okay, good.
Well Hey, hey, come here.
You didn't tell Angela about us, did you?
I would never.
Why?
You know, she was shooting me nasty looks at dinner, and I almost didn't enjoy my pudding.
Did you say anything to Shawn about us, because I think he's been winking at me.
I would never.
Hey, I know how to keep a secret.
Now, remember, my parents are in there, so just act natural.
Okay.
Cory, Shawn just told us the big news.
Why didn't you say anything?
You told them?
You told Shawn?
Oh, of course I told Shawn!
Aren't you angry?
Well, you guys have been together forever.
Why would I be angry?
Talk about a load off my mind, huh?
I think you and Shawn will be very happy together as roommates.
You and Shawn?
What about us?
Topanga, I don't think the school would allow you and Cory to be roommates unless you were married.
Here's where I'm dead.
I thought we were going to decide this together.
Well, I was going to discuss it.
Hey, you knew about it, too?
You told Angela?
You told Shawn.
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't tell me.
Hey, everybody.
Got this new roommate.
She is fine!
All right, I'd kind of like to know what is going on now.
Okay, Dad, uh, see Topanga and I are, you know, uh It's really kind of amusing if you think about it.
Uh, see, what's going to happen is, um Cory and I are getting married.
Are you out of your minds?
Why?
'Cause they love each other.
No, that's not a reason.
They are too young.
You can't even clean up your room.
I'm going to get to it.
You'll wait until you finish college.
Of course they'll wait.
They haven't decided anything yet.
Whose idiot idea was this?
Mine.
It was my idiot idea.
It's my idiot life, and I have the right to decide if I want to be a married idiot.
I asked Cory to marry me.
Please don't yell at my fiancee.
Topanga, I thought you had more sense.
I asked Bobby Peplowski to marry me, then he kicked me.
Have you thought of the responsibilities you're gonna have?
No, they haven't.
They haven't thought of anything.
Okay, Angela, let's just stay out of this.
No.
These are our friends.
How can you let them ruin their lives?
They're not like us.
They're hopelessly in love.
And so are we.
So are we.
We have paid for your food, for your clothes, for your phone, for your car insurance You think you can handle all that?
You know what?
You two got married when you were my age, right?
I was a dope.
I take that back.
What I mean, what I'm trying to say is think of all the things in life you'll be missing out on.
Dad, Topanga and I No, no, you think you know what you want from your life, huh?
You think you've got it all figured out.
Well, things don't always turn out the way you plan.
So, if you're going to do this, you better prepare to make sacrifices.
What sacrifices did you make, Alan?
What?
What do you mean we're not hopelessly in love?
What?
I'm just trying to make a point to the kids.
No, listen.
You're not listening to me.
Well, they're taking it better than I thought.
Well, it isn't for them to decide.
Okay, this is our lives, Topanga.
Nobody is going to tell us what to do.
Come on.
We're getting married.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
If everybody'll just calm down, I think I can be the voice of reason here.
I think they should get married.
Amen.
Stop it, Shawn.
Eric, sit down!
Thank you, Dad.
All right, listen.
The chances that Cory could find a woman like Topanga are, like, one in a million.
There's nobody better.
Well, it's true.
Oh, we all love Topanga.
That's not the issue.
Yes, but, see, in a few years, she's going to dry up.
She's going to get all wrinkly.
Might as well just grab her while she's still smooth.
Am I right there, Dad?
You're an imbecile.
Have any of you guys noticed that Cory and Topanga aren't here?
Cory, are you positive you want to do this?
We're in the car, aren't we?
Yeah, I know, but you're not just doing this because your parents are against it?
Topanga, I told you, it's my life.
I decide what I want to do with it.
What happens when you get to college and you see everybody meeting each other and dating and having fun?
Are you going to wish you could be doing the same thing?
Well, it didn't faze me in high school, why should it faze me now?
Cory, you had your heart set on this big, romantic wedding.
Listen, Topanga, I can't think of anything more romantic than sneaking off to a quiet little wedding chapel in the country.
I want to marry you.
That's what I have my heart set on.
I do.
Then why did you pass the exit?
Stop hounding me.
Yeah, well, we said some pretty awful things.
No.
We just told them the truth.
They probably just went to think things over.
I bet they eloped.
Without our permission?
Cory?
I don't think so.
Hey, I know him.
If he's forced to choose between anything and Topanga, it's no contest.
Remember when we told your father we were going to get married?
What did we do?
Well, that was different.
I mean, he was stubborn, totally set against it, wouldn't listen to anything we had to Oh, boy!
Oh, boy.
Don't worry about it.
Guys, can I be the voice of reason here again?
That's great.
Um Maybe you are responsible.
In fact, I know you are, what with the bickering and the lecturing and the yelling.
Okay, Eric.
We have to support Cory and Topanga and accept this marriage.
We can't push them out of our lives like we pushed them to elope.
They love each other, and they belong together, just like me and Rachel.
Who's Rachel?
She's my beautiful new roommate angel.
She's back at the apartment right now with Jack.
Oh, no.
Wait, what if they hit it off and she cheats on me?
I'd trip, man.
Gonna get back and start slapping some people around.
It is our fault.
We drove them to it.
Judge Bemis?
Yes.
Hi, I'm Cory Matthews.
We talked on the phone.
Oh, come on in, young man.
Come on in.
And, uh, this must be the bride with the nutty name.
Topanga.
Topanga.
That's silly.
Now, this is my wife P-foofta.
Our one friend calls me Foofie.
How do you do?
How do you do?
She'll be your witness.
Oh, they're so young, Henry.
Pay her no mind.
We've been marrying folks for 36 years, and she bawls like a baby every time.
Stop it!
We appreciate you guys doing this for us at such a late hour.
Oh, nonsense.
This is what we do.
Besides, we can't be choosy.
Everybody wants a big wedding these days.
Nobody wants to elope no more.
Well, I do.
Right, Cory?
Cory, say I do.
Already?
Shawn and I are very different people, but we're brothers, and there's really nothing we wouldn't do for each other.
Then we beat each other up.
Yeah, me and my sister are the same way.
Oh, well, if you're ever homesick and you want to wrestle What, me wrestle with you?
Oh, God, no.
I'm a girl.
Whoa!
But I am one big old girl.
Yeah, that's right.
She's sitting on me, man.
We were just fooling around.
Oh, no.
Please don't go.
So, where were you, Eric?
Oh, well, I While you guys were here having your little sumo fest, I was putting a crisis out on the home front.
Is everything okay?
It is now.
Cory and Topanga, that's my little brother and Topanga, they ran off to elope.
My parents kind of went mental.
I calmed everything down.
How'd you do that?
I said, "Calm down, you.
" Oh.
Yep.
Then I explained to them that we love both my brother and Topanga, and it would be It would just be better if we accepted the marriage rather than push them out of our lives and make them hate our guts, you know?
That is so romantic of you.
She's not sitting on you, is she?
Oh, in here she is, my friend.
In here she is.
Oh.
Yeah, that's right.
You know, I can hear everything you guys are saying.
Oh, you guys are terrific.
You know, being with you makes me realize what a creep my boyfriend really is.
You deserve better.
You deserve the best.
I'm saying.
You know what my problem is?
My problem is that I always feel that I need a man in my life, and I always choose the wrong one.
This is why I'm so lucky to have found you two.
Oh.
God, it's such a relief knowing we can live together without all that, you know Yeah.
That is good.
That's a relief.
Ooh, would have been hard.
We're going to be just like girlfriends.
Girlfriends.
If I understand this correctly, girlfriends sleep together, bathe together, and even get to see each other naked.
We already do that.
Oh, it's all my fault.
I came down way too hard on them.
I I made them do it.
I'm the one that jumped all over them.
Cory stood up to me like a man, and I just shot him down.
No, no.
Cory came to me for advice.
He wanted me to tell him to wait.
I told him to go ahead and get married.
Well, hey, don't look at me.
I said all the right things.
But it didn't matter.
You can't tell Cory and Topanga what to do.
I've been trying to do that since the first grade.
I remember when I tried to separate their desks.
She kicked me, he bit me, and some little punk kept saying, "Leave them alone.
They should get married.
" I was cute then, huh?
Precious.
But the point is, your advice came from a good place, but Cory and Topanga aren't in the first grade anymore.
They made their own decision, and I think they'll be fine because they've been well brought up.
And well taught.
Well, I've done the best I can.
Alan What's wrong?
I wish we could be at the wedding.
We are gathered here today to join in holy matrimony Cory and Topanga.
But they're so young, Henry.
Why don't we just give them back their money?
That would be a nice gesture.
still don't get it.
This is what we do for a living.
Where was I?
Cut to the chase.
Do you, Cory, take Topanga to be your wife, to honor and cherish her, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
Well, I always have.
I always will.
I do.
And do you, Topanga, take Cory to be your husband, to honor and cherish him, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
In case you didn't see last week's Boy Meets World, here's why I have this look on my face.
And do you, Topanga, take Cory to be your husband, to honor and cherish him, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
I I Do.
I We got "I".
We're looking for "do.
" I This is just the strangest thing.
Excuse me.
Topanga, listen.
You can do this, okay?
I did it.
I was a real man about it.
Now, don't leave me up here in my wedding dress.
Let me try this again.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now we're cooking with gas.
I Do.
Do can't.
I can't.
Oh, you hate to see that!
I'm so sorry, Cory.
I'm so sorry, Judge Bemis.
Foofie.
You know what's funny?
What's that, son?
She asked me.
Boy, I am so sorry my family missed that.
I'm sorry, Cory.
Wow!
I don't know what to say.
"Do"!
You know, "do"?
It's the first half of your favorite word, "don't.
" I don't like your tone.
You don't like I drive 1,000 miles to marry her and she don't like my tone.
That is really rich.
I want my family to be at my wedding.
I want your family to be there.
Cory, I want to wear a wedding dress.
A white, lacy wedding dress.
Of course, white.
The way we're going, bright white.
Snow white.
Whiter than the white-hot light of 1,000 burning suns!
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
Ten minutes.
We raise Cory carefully.
We teach him everything we know, we do the best we can, and then we disagree over one thing, and all of a sudden, he's gone.
He's not gone.
He's a good kid.
He would never get married without us.
Are you sure?
Absolutely not.
But what the heck?
We're having another one, aren't we?
Hmm?
I'm giving you the next Don't you ever do anything without me.
He won't.
And neither will I. So come on, let's all go to bed, okay?
Come on, it's 3:15.
Only creeps and weirdoes are up now.
How you doing?
You were thinking about your brother, weren't you?
Yeah.
I got a six-foot-tall wonder-woman sleeping in the room next to me.
I was thinking about my brother, though.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Well, I couldn't sleep, if you know my current situation, and there's nothing on TV, so Hey, wait a second.
What are you guys doing up?
The only people up now are creeps and weirdoes.
How you doing?
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Eighteen years I'm his best friend.
I raise him right, teach him everything I know.
I thought you wanted them to get married.
Yeah, but not without me.
I'm supposed to be the best man.
Hey, wait a second.
I'm supposed to be the best man.
Maybe that's why they eloped.
They couldn't choose between us.
No, Eric.
No.
They eloped because your parents tried to tell them what to do, so they drove up to some justice of the peace up north.
At least that's what he said on my machine.
You heard from him?
He really did get married?
"He's a good kid"?
"He'll never get married without us"?
I am keeping my knees together and this one is never getting out.
Can I crash on you guys' couch?
I don't want to be up this late with all the creeps and weirdoes.
How you doing?
Hi, George.
I couldn't sleep.
Why not?
Well, you got all the lights on.
Everybody's yelling.
And Eric parked his car in my garden.
So?
What the hell do you care?
You're moving.
Go ahead, Feeny, retire.
Take care of yourself, that's what you're best at.
The man has given the last 40 years of his life teaching people.
Don't care.
Kill his flowers.
Kill them.
Eric, when someone you care for makes a considered decision to change his life, then those who do care should offer their support and respect his decision.
Oh, Feeny, you had me at "Eric," man.
Come here.
You're right, George.
We should accept what they've done and do something to show our support.
I mean, after all, we're talking about Cory and Topanga here.
Cory and Topanga?
I was talking about a going-away party for me.
Going away?
You're still going away?
Oh, for the love of Mike, stop with the mindgames, man.
You know, this is the reason I can't sell my house.
Put the mirror back.
Gee, sorry, I'll put it back just like you had it.
There.
Great.
Now I can see if there are any cars coming at my crotch!
Stop snapping at me!
We ran off together, and you know what we did?
Nothing.
Our big dramatic moment, and you know what we did?
Nothing.
I don't care about a big dramatic moment, Cory!
It's not right to run off together because we think we have something to prove.
When we get married, I want to have a big cake.
I want doves.
No doves.
You were right.
You did the right thing.
Our marriage should be a celebration, not a secret.
Thank you.
You owe me the rest of your life, you know.
It's yours.
Hey, Rachel, what's up?
Rachel, how you doing?
What smells so good?
I am making you two French toast.
But I'm not going to do it every day, so don't get spoiled, okay?
Okay.
Jack, Jack, Jackie, Jack, Jack.
Live a healthy life, eat all your vegetables, honor you father and your mother, and heaven will reward you with a hot-hot-hottie-hot hottie-hottie-hot-hot for a roommate.
I need to tell you two something.
Don't leave.
We'll do anything.
When I met you, I was in really bad shape.
But you two, you took me in.
You rescued me.
I just want you to know how grateful I am to you.
I am so lucky.
You guys are my heroes.
Thank you so much.
No, thank you.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, we're the ones that are lucky.
Oh Come here, you.
One more.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Oh.
By the way, by the way, I promise I'm not going to be a bathroom hog, but I really do like to start the morning with a bubble bath.
I like to put in all the aromatherapy beads and all the bubbles and It's just my favorite part of the day.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
I demand you take bubble baths.
Really?
Why?
"Why"?
Jack?
Well, um You know, if you didn't take bubble baths, that means you're not comfortable Comfortable.
living here with us.
With us.
We just want you to be yourself.
With bubbles.
Oh, you guys.
You know, I am this close to being glad that my boyfriend actually left me.
No!
Please.
Oh, man.
That girl is taking a bubble bath in the bathtub of our bathroom.
We're geniuses.
Dude.
Don't know if this is the right time to say I love you, man.
Dude.
Don't even, man.
I'm the one that loves you.
Dude!
Dude!
Come here!
Oh, boys, you know what?
I can't figure out how to work the stopper in the bathtub.
Could one of you please come show me?
Come on!
Cory, wait.
I'm scared.
I don't want your parents to be mad at me.
I love them.
Well, they are gonna be mad.
Topanga, In fact, if I know anything, they are gonna be furious.
Congratulations, newlyweds!
Congratulations!
We're so proud of you.
Congratulations.
It's really great.
I always felt like you were a sister to me.
Now you really are.
Cor, you gotta try these cheese balls, man.
They're, like, insane, they're so good.
What's happening?
They think we're married.
You guys look exactly the same.
What'd I tell you, Cor?
You were always married.
Doesn't take a piece of paper to change what always was.
Shawn, I gotta tell you something.
Oh, and I want to hear all about it.
But not in front of your parents, okay?
Okay, everybody, listen up, please.
I just want to say that I am the luckiest man in the world.
I have one beautiful wife, a lovely daughter and one wonderful son!
Hey!
Hey!
And now I have yet another lovely daughter.
I think we should tell them.
Not now.
He's talking about me.
To Cory and Topanga, all the best.
We love you.
To Cory and Topanga!
My little brother!
Whoo!
Well, well, well.
Mr. Feeny, before No, no.
It's my turn, Mr. Matthews.
You have done quite enough tonight now, haven't you?
For 40 years, I have taught young men and women.
I have seen countless lovestruck children.
But I have never seen the love, the loyalty and the fun that I have seen in you two.
My friends, my dears, Cory and Topanga.
Hear, hear!
Cory and Topanga!
Well, it's the mother's turn, and I do want to say something.
I have watched these two grow up.
Boy, have I. And here they are now, adults, just fresh out of high school.
Don't know anything about the world at all I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
This is a mistake.
And I do not support it.
Why couldn't you have just gone to Yale?
Hear, hear!
I should go.
No.
Topanga, you're not leaving your own wedding reception.
I'm sorry for any pain I've caused.
Topanga, wait How could you say that to her?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
So for 15 years you've been lying to me?
No.
No.
You've been lying to me about how you feel about us, and you've been lying to me about how you feel about her.
I want what I believe is best for you, Cory, and Topanga.
What's best for us, Mom, is for you to trust us!
I love her!
All right?
I will always love her.
And you know something else?
We didn't get married, because she wanted you to be there!
Who's the present for?
No one.
You bought a present for Rachel, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it's a book!
So she has something to read in the bathtub.
You know something?
That's cold.
You're trying to get her to like you more than she likes me.
That is cold, man.
What about that stuff before about, "Oh, dude, I love you," all that stuff?
It's just plain cold.
Oh, and, uh, what's that, slime-wipe?
Some kind of bird for Rachel.
Your present's stupid.
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Rachel.
Hey, I bought you this bird.
It reminded me of you because it has bright red feathers and it eats like a bird.
You bought me a present?
Oh, I got you this book, um, which I've read, and I thought maybe you'd like it.
Keats.
How did you know that that was my favorite poet?
I told him.
What just happened?
Something bad.
Can we eat this?
They're too young to even think about marriage.
I understand that you don't want our little boy to make a mistake, but he is not a little boy anymore.
Please.
I still lay out his clothes.
And what she wants to do Topanga.
Right.
What she wants to do Topanga.
Use her name.
Right.
What Topanga wants to do is Lay his clothes out for him.
What?
Take care of him.
Be there for him.
Amy Do you think that this would bother you as much if this was some girl who couldn't take care of him as well as you have?
Do you really think that Topanga isn't right for him?
It isn't about that.
They are too young.
He's not ready.
I'm not ready.
Yes, she's right for Cory.
She loves him.
And yes, she She'll take care of him.
And he'll be happy.
Oh, God.
I'm jealous of her.
Oh, honey.
Hey, we still have Eric.
Oh, God!
She's been in there a really long time.
I know.
You don't think that she, like Nah.
She's too tall for that.
We're freaks, man.
She just comes off a bad relationship.
She's vulnerable.
Yeah.
And both of us are going after her like she's some kind of cheese ravioli.
Yeah.
When she really needs a couple of friends.
I'm telling you something, Jack.
We better make it safe for her around here before it's too late.
Oh, no, it's too late.
We're not letting you go.
What?
We know why you think you have to leave.
Why do I have to leave?
Because of the extreme sexual tension that we've created in this here, your new habitat.
Oh, yeah.
You feel it, too, huh?
Yes.
And we realize that if we have any chance of keeping you here, we have to stop thinking of you as a Puff pastry on a plate.
And more like a Person.
And we won't chase after you, compete for you.
We'll be what you really need.
Roommates and friends.
And that's it?
That's it.
So, what do you think?
Come on, will you stay?
Stay?
I was never moving out.
Yeah!
You know, I love my book.
And my bird, too.
You guys treat me better than my boyfriend ever did.
You know, I think that started to scare me.
I just realized that I could easily fall for either one of you.
And then I thought, well, so what if I do?
Because I can deal with that.
Oh, no!
We guessed wrong.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, you didn't, 'cause we have to keep this strictly platonic, no matter what I'm feeling inside.
Well, then, what's in the suitcase, then, Rach?
Just some mementos from my old boyfriend.
I was on the way to the incinerator to burn them.
So, I guess when we get back, we'll start our new relationship.
Thanks, guys.
You really saved me from myself.
You know, you two are the most sensitive, caring men that I've ever met.
Thanks.
The bird's ready.
I should leave.
You don't need to leave.
Topanga.
Um, could you come over here, talk to me for a minute?
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
Why don't we let them have a little talk?
Because I'm afraid Mom's going to kill Topanga and bury her in the sandbox.
It's very hard for a mother to think that another woman is going to take her place with her little boy.
I could never take your place.
I just love your little boy, Mrs. Matthews.
Amy.
Use my name.
Amy.
And if there is going to be another person to take my place, I want it to be you.
Thank you.
I'm really proud of you, Cory.
You stood up for what you believed in, and you made your own decision.
Yeah, but, I mean, Topanga was right.
It would have been wrong to get married just because you said we shouldn't.
I raised a good man.
You calling me a man?
Yeah.
You want to get off that swing and do something about it?
Yeah, I do.
We came down here to tell you guys that we will always be here for you no matter what you decide.
And the one thing we don't ever want to do is make you feel afraid to come to us with any important decision.
Uh, well, we have made a decision.
In fact, I think we've made the most important decision of our lives.
We love you both.
And now that there's going to be a wedding, you're going to need this.
This was my mother's engagement ring, and I would be honored if you would wear it.
Amy I want it to stay in the family.
Hold it.
Remember me?
Cory?
Don't I get to do anything?
No, no, no, no.
I don't get to propose, I don't get to put the ring on her hand, I don't get to do nothing.
Welcome to marriage.
Cor, we have a lot to do, a whole wedding to plan.
Actually, no, we don't.
What?
You said no to her?
What is the matter with you?
Ow, ow, ow!
I told you, we made a decision.
We made it together.
We listened to our friends, and we listened to our families, but we made it on our own.
So, what did you decide?
I'm gonna tell you, but there's something I need to do first.
Topanga.
Come here.
We've been together our entire lives, and you know that I love you more than anything in the world.
Will you marry me?
Yes, Cory.
Yes, I will.
All right, already.
When's the wedding?
That's what we decided.
We're gonna get married when we're ready.
And when we're ready, you'll be the first to know.
So, have a great time in Jackson Hole.
Here's to your retirement, George.
Hear, hear!
Thank you, Alan.
I'll miss you all.
Well, I guess it's time for Feeny's favorite student to make a speech, huh?
For 40 years, I have watched you educate young men and women.
Boy, have I. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
This is a mistake, and I do not support it!
Why couldn't you have just gone to Yale?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, hey, you in college?
I'm in college.
Woo-hoo!
College!
College!
Cor, Cor, Cor, calm down, okay?
Nobody knows us yet.
I don't want to be immediately established as the "woo-hoo" boys.
Okay, okay.
This is us.
Wait, Shawn.
We can't just go in this room.
I mean, this is big.
You can't just open this door.
Cor, we're not in high school anymore.
That crap just has to stop.
It's so beautiful.
No.
No.
"Beautiful" is not a strong enough word.
A better word is, like, sucks.
Give me a spoon.
I'm digging a tunnel right now.
Wow.
What's the matter?
You brought pudding to college!
Hey, I got one for you.
No.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Listen to me.
No pudding.
No woo-hooing.
Okay?
You're right.
You're right.
We're in college now, fellow.
This is a chance to reinvent ourselves, right?
We can be anything we want.
No.
No reinvention, okay?
You can be yourself, just without the pudding.
Because I swear on my mother, wherever the hell she is, if I get to be known as pudding boy's best friend, I will kill you.
You can't ruin my mood, Shawn.
Hey, Cory.
I think when you bolted from the car yelling, "College, college," I think you forgot something.
My pudding trunk.
This is exciting, isn't it, Cor?
My little boy in college.
Gone for four years.
Boy!
Well Well, hey, thanks for raising me.
See you.
Yeah, come on, guys, let's go.
Time is money.
See you in four years.
I'll miss you, Morgan.
That's not fair.
Oh.
Oh Come here.
Shawn?
Ah, sure.
Why not?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Alan, I'm gonna miss my baby boy.
Mom, you didn't get like this for Eric.
He doesn't know we're here, does he?
Uh, let's get out of here.
Shawnie, we're here.
We're in college.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is pretty cool.
Hey, look, Angela, I found us some college guys.
She means us.
Ah!
Well, the four of us are here at Pennbrook.
Well, let's check it out.
Cory, remember, we're in college now.
Nobody knows us.
Be cool.
Right, yeah.
Okay, look, we got hallways, rooms, and co-ed bathroom.
Oh, see, Shawny?
In college, girls are not called girls.
They are called "Co-eds.
" Boy, is she butch.
Cory, the bathroom is for men and women.
Both?
At the same time.
Just like on Ally McBeal.
"Just like on Ally McBeal.
" Let her go in there!
Cory, it's no big deal.
I'm going in.
Aw, come on.
I just got comfortable going in front of guys!
Registration.
Here is where we make the decisions that will determine who we are and what we know for the rest of our lives.
Oh, shut up.
Cory, we're freshman.
There's really no big decision to make here.
It's anything that says "101" or "Intro to.
" Sure, if you wanna go the safe way.
Here we go.
You see I was studying my course guide last night.
Now, the old Cory would've gone down that road of safe and easy courses, but I refuse to be trampled by the masses registering for a little course I like to call "Introduction to mediocrity.
" You done?
Yeah.
Good.
Okay.
Cattle.
This looks good.
Hey, come on, we gotta get going.
Yeah, let's get going, Rachel.
Idiot!
You made her cry.
"Rachel.
" That's what my boyfriend used to call me.
What?
Hey, come on, there's gonna be plenty of time for that stroll-down- memory-lane later there, babe.
I got to get there before Hooked on Phonics gets filled up.
Eric, come on, man.
Can't you see she's upset?
Obviously, I don't have your power of perception.
What?
Everything!
Okay.
That's good.
It's out.
Everything's out.
Move, move, move.
Let's go.
I just don't know what I'm doing here.
I mean, we had plans.
We were gonna live together.
We were gonna go to college together.
We were gonna get a doggy.
I know.
Feels like your whole world is turned upside down, right?
School's about to start.
You're living with two guys you don't really even know in some strange town.
Everything's just kind of hitting you at once, right?
You know, Jack, that is exactly how I feel.
Oh, you are so sensitive.
Oh, thanks.
I just wish I had some way to pull myself out of this, you know?
I've got the perfect thing.
Eric, this is not the time.
Nonsense, Jack.
It's always the time for Eric!
Come on, Jack!
No!
Oh, you are so much fun.
Yay, me.
And you are so caring.
Boy, you know what?
If you two were one guy, I would be in real trouble.
Huh!
"One guy.
" No.
You're already done registering?
Yeah.
I registered, I got my books, and I bought each of us a Pennbrook sweatshirt.
Huh?
Go, penguins!
Don't ever do that.
"Quantum physics, "Theoretical calculus, "Inorganic chemistry, "Forensic pathology"?
Is this your son, Mr. Johnson?
Oh, Cory, Cory, Cory, how do I put this delicately?
Could you be a bigger moron?
Why would you ask me that?
Why?
Because your college career is over before it starts.
Somebody's jealous.
Cory, you've taken on an impossible load that will eventually crush you to death.
I know, but I figure we'll have ten or 12 good years together first.
That's a good All I wanted you to do is stop with the pudding.
What is this?
Do you even know what quantum physics is?
Um, hi.
That's what they're gonna teach me.
If I knew what quantum physics was, I would've tooken quantum physics 2, now, wouldn't I?
Have you looked at this?
It's gibberish.
It's not gibberish.
You're gibberish.
It's new and exciting, just like me.
So nuts to you, you jerks.
Uh, excuse me there, Professor.
Um, my friends seem to think that I've taken on an impossible load with quantum physics and that I'm gonna have some trouble understanding the course material.
Well, I could give you a brief synopsis, and you can decide for yourself.
On the first day, we start off with And then we focus on Excuse me.
We have a staff meeting.
Everything's fine.
And I know that this is not about quantum physics.
It was just my nervous psyche that heard the professor say And that doesn't scare me for two seconds, but is there any way that you could possibly get me out of every course that I signed up for this year?
You're feeling overwhelmed?
Yes.
Well, you are not alone in feeling that, son.
Yeah, I'm I'm just worried that I can't drop these courses and that, you know, I've ruined my entire life in one day.
Nonsense.
You can drop any course you want, and you can pick up any course that's open.
Good.
I want everything 101 or anything that starts with "Introduction to.
" Oh.
Those are gone.
Yes, um, I know that they're gone, but I told you, I made a terrible mistake.
Now, will you please fix it?
Oh, you want me to fix this?
Well, I can't do that.
What do you mean?
I mean those courses are closed.
I know that they're closed, but I told you, I made a terrible mistake.
I accept full responsibility for that.
Now, will you please help me?
Son, did you know that one in three new students won't make it through their freshman year?
Why are you telling me that?
Because college isn't for everyone, son.
And if you find just simple course selection so overwhelming, well, perhaps you need to consider if it's for you.
Look, you're my guidance counselor.
I get into trouble, and you guide me out.
That's gonna be our relationship, yes?
This is college.
The real world.
The relationship you're talking about?
It doesn't exist here.
I'm sorry.
Buh-bye.
You lied to me.
You filled me with all this education.
But you never prepared me for life.
I'm sorry.
Have we met?
You failed me, Mr. Feeny.
Several times, I believe.
You didn't prepare me for college.
You didn't prepare me for life.
I'm in way over my head, and I have no idea how I got there.
It's good to see you, Mr. Matthews.
It's good to see you, Mr. Feeny.
That's a nice hat.
Anybody know you're here?
You mean does anyone know I screwed up college on my first day and flew to Wyoming on my air miles?
Air miles?
Where did you get those?
Pudding labels, baby.
Got me to Omaha.
Bused in from there.
I met a Native American and a militia guy.
"Casinos good.
Government bad.
" So.
How's, uh How's retirement going?
Oh, well, I'm having a wonderful time.
Yeah?
Well, what's so great?
Tell me about your day.
Well, after spending 40 years as a schoolteacher setting my alarm to wake up with the sun, I now wake up whenever I want to.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then I have a big breakfast with some of the boys.
You got boys?
I do.
And then we do whatever our hearts desire.
For example, today, we decided to go fishing.
Fishing?
Mmm-hmm.
All day.
This is all That's all you do all day, is just fish?
Well, there's more to it than just fish.
I mean, we swap stories, enjoy the outdoors, and more importantly, each other's company.
I had a company once, until my son-in-law stole it.
Easy, Ned.
You'll blow your pacemaker.
So, basically, Mr. Feeny, if I'm understanding this correctly, you guys, you do absolutely nothing.
I wouldn't characterize it No, he's got it.
No pressures, no commitments, no decisions, and no way to screw up anything at all.
Cory, perhaps you'd be good enough to explain to me why you traveled all this distance just to insult me.
Insult you?
George, I envy you!
I mean, this is the next best thing to being in a coma!
Huh?
Oh, it's you.
Get lost.
What are you doing?
Hey, shut your cake hole, Irene.
I'm sensitive, all right?
Rachel's gonna come back here.
She's gonna see how sensitive I am, know that I'm all man and not half-man like your sorry tushy.
Congratulations, man.
You're officially in the Idiot Hall of Fame.
That hurts me, but I understand where it's coming from, and it's okay.
Eric, you're trying to change who you are just to get her to like you.
She's gonna see right through that, man.
No, she's not.
She's gonna come back and fall for me and fall deep into my trap of sensitivity.
All right.
As your friend, I'm begging you not to make a fool out of yourself.
All right.
As a friend, I'm begging you not to make a fool out of yourself.
Huh?
How was that, man?
It's like looking in a mirror, huh?
It's Face Off!
Eric, Jack.
Jack, Eric.
You don't even know who you are anymore.
Hey, guys.
Hello, Rachel.
Eric, what's the matter?
It's the children.
It's the children.
The children?
What children?
All of them.
They're so little.
You just Please don't make me go on.
'Cause the world is a melancholy place where human relationships must rise to the forefront of our too brief experience on this insignificant swirling blue orb, until we're extinguished like a flickering flame.
Ow!
That hot.
Oh, Eric, that is the most sensitive thing I've ever heard.
Would you go with me to do laundry?
What?
I'm sorry, Jack.
I need to be alone with Eric.
You do?
She do!
I feel your pain, buddy, I do, but get outta my way.
We've got to attend to the delicates.
Yes, we do.
She's gonna see right through me, though, isn't she?
Dude, this is her bra!
Get Nice day, huh, Walter?
Yep.
Who's up for a movie?
Hmm?
That's a pretty good idea, George.
Uh-huh!
Why don't we wait till it rains?
Why can't we do it now?
Well, we're fishing now.
Fish are really jumping.
No, they're not.
I haven't seen a fish since I've been here.
Take it easy, George.
We've got the rest of our lives to catch a fish.
Walter makes an awful lot of sense, George.
No, he doesn't.
And his name is not Walter.
It's Cory.
Cory is too young a name to be here.
Cory's too young to be here.
I'm too young to be here.
Good one, George.
Look, Mr. Matthews, I have indulged your little fantasy for a weekend hoping that you would come to your senses, but obviously, no one here comes to their senses.
Now, don't insult our way of life, George.
I'm sorry, Ned.
I'm just not ready for your way of life.
We'll miss you, George.
Back to school, Walter.
You know, Rachel, I'm glad you noticed the sensitive side of me as well as the devil-may-care side.
You have it all, Eric.
Everything a girl could want.
Thank you.
Uh, why'd you lock the door?
Well, if it was open, then somebody could come in, couldn't they?
And then they'd take all the best machines.
That's good thinking there, Rach.
No, no, no, silly.
See, I brought you here because I've never found you more attractive than I do right now.
Whee!
I am so hot.
Are you?
Yeah.
I'm hot.
This dryer's on fluff.
So am I. Rachel, what are you doing?
This shirt's clean.
I know.
I just wanted it smushed up a little bit.
Oh, smushing's good.
I like smushing.
I think No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Rachel, this is wrong.
Oh, come on.
What's the matter, Eric?
Don't you want me?
Yeah, yeah.
But not in the laundry room.
I mean, I always figured that if we ever did do this, it would be in some romantic fleabag motel.
Hey, if you went to all the trouble to be the perfect man for me, then the least I could do is be the perfect woman for you.
This isn't you.
I don't like this you.
You don't?
Then what do you want me to be?
Sensitive?
Funny?
A brunette?
I just want you to be yourself!
I mean, if you're not yourself, then what are you?
Somebody else.
Right.
And if you want to be in a relationship with me, then I want you to be there, not somebody Oh, I get it.
And I want you to be the funny, wonderful person you are.
'Cause that's how I like you.
Promise me you're not gonna change, okay?
'Kay.
One condition.
Okay, anything.
Put me back on the dryer.
Okay.
Whoo!
I understand you've dedicated your life to teaching, Mr. Feeny.
But that was at the high school level.
This is college.
As I understand it, high school serves to prepare you for college.
Am I correct?
Well, there are who were able to register correctly.
He wasn't.
Perhaps he wasn't adequately prepared.
You know something, Myron?
Out of all my nephews, I hate you the most.
Come on, Cory.
There's nothing to be done here.
Mother will be calling you.
Mr. Feeny, I'm sorry.
I feel like I failed you.
I guess I didn't prepare you as well as I should.
Maybe it's just as well I retired.
No.
No.
No.
Mr. Feeny.
The things The most important things that I learned from you have nothing to do with the courses that I'm taking here in college, anyway.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean What I learned from you was mostly about life and how to make friends and how to help and support the people you care about.
That's what you taught all of us.
How you doing, Mr. Feeny?
Howdy.
Thank you for bringing my Walter home.
Hi.
Listen, I'd love to chat, but Mr. Feeny and I, we gotta start studying for quantum Whatever it is I signed up for.
Here.
What's this?
It's your schedule.
You have two classes with me and three with Shawn.
I figured you'd want it that way.
I don't get it.
How'd you do this?
Well, we each signed up for an extra class And then we dropped one And signed you up instead.
And then we got your books and returned them for the right ones.
You did?
How'd you know to do this?
Hey.
We had the same teacher you did.
So I'm ready to start college now?
I think you are, Mr. Matthews.
I think you all are.
Now, you promise me you're not gonna change who you are?
You like me like I am?
Very much.
I do have a sensitive side, you know.
I know.
Can I have my bra back, please?
Nope.
You see?
You are funny.
And nobody should change the way they are.
Laundry room?
Yeah, laundry room.
Come on, Jack.
I'm going to the laundry room.
Next time, ask before you borrow my bike!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, he can't talk.
She's got his tongue.
Hello!
We're supposed to be meeting new people.
I want to make out.
Oh, come on, Angela.
This is our freshman orientation.
You know, this is a new place.
We're supposed to be meeting new people.
You don't want to make out with me?
No, I absolutely want to make out, you know.
I just want to meet people, and I've never met anybody while I'm making out.
Except for one night, but that was a fluke.
Hi, I'm Camryn.
Hi, I'm Shawn.
And this is my friend Angela.
What?
What?
You said "friend.
" I did?
I meant, this is my girlfriend Angela.
My girlfriend.
Oh, you two are together?
Shawn?
Girlfriend and boyfriend.
Oh!
Well, see you around campus.
All right.
Cool.
How you doing?
I'm good, friend.
How you doing?
Oh, come on, Angela.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry, okay?
Let's make out.
Oh, it's okay.
We don't have to.
We can meet new people.
I just didn't know it was that important to you.
I don't want you to miss out on anything.
What do you mean by that?
You want to meet new people, and I'm not new people, so what do you want it to mean?
You know, whoever thought up these orientations is a genius.
You know, you're going to have to go in there sometime.
Men and women going to the same bathroom.
It's freaky!
Cory, it's just a co-ed bathroom.
Come on, come in with me.
No!
You're going to look at me!
I won't look at you!
You don't want to look at me?
Fine.
I'll look at you.
I knew it!
You have issues.
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you going, sunshine?
I'm going to take a shower and meet chicks.
Hey!
My girlfriend's in there.
Okay!
Wow!
Wow!
Still can't go in there, huh, Cor?
I'm telling you, you might like it.
I, for one, can't get enough of it.
Girls shower in there.
Naked.
So what do you care about naked girls?
You have your own naked girl.
I mean, she has the potential to be naked at some point in her career.
Well, actually, not anymore.
Angela and I decided to take a break.
You broke up?
Yeah.
I guess that's what we did.
Why?
You know, it wasn't just my idea.
It was Angela's, too.
Yeah, but why?
Okay, after that orientation party, we talked about all the new opportunities that are open up to us here, and, you know, neither one of us want to miss out.
Hey, I got to tell you, Shawn, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
We just want to see what else is out there.
What a bunch of crap, Shawn.
Come on!
You know that there's nothing out there better than you and her.
Cory, not everybody's like you, you know.
Not everybody spends the rest of their life with one girlfriend.
Topanga, did you know that Shawn Shawn and Angela broke up?
Yeah, Angela told me.
I think you guys are both handling it with incredible maturity.
How is breaking up mature?
Working it out is mature.
Sticking together is mature.
Cory, not every couple is just like us.
Yeah, but I want them to be like us.
I want them to be happy.
Angela and I aren't going to let this affect our friendship, so neither should you.
You guys are both my friends no matter what happens, okay?
Cor?
Yeah.
You're both my friends.
No matter what happens.
And I know you'll be together in the end.
Yeah.
You try and tell the guy that something's over, and he just won't let it go.
Hey, hey, doesn't that guy behind me look like Mr. Feeny?
Oh, don't even!
Feeny moved to Wyoming, okay?
I have closed that chapter in my life, and I've opened up a new one.
And you know what I call that chapter, Jack?
Chapter five.
No, no, you know what?
I think he's right.
He does look like the guy in the poster by your bed.
How you doing?
You think that that kid's Feeny?
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure.
All right.
Let's test him.
I'm going to ask him a question that only Feeny would know the answer to.
Are you George Feeny?
It's me, you moron.
Correct!
Hey!
Mr. Feeny, you couldn't stay away from me!
Hello, Mr. Matthews.
Hello, Mr. Hunter.
How you doing?
And Miss McGuire.
Rachel.
George Feeny.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Eric talks about you all the time.
It's such a pleasure to finally meet Eric's grandpa.
Your what?
Maybe someday.
So, Mr. Feeny, what are you doing here?
I mean, I thought you were retired.
No, he couldn't stay away from me.
He's conveniently come back to teach this class.
Actually, I came back to be a student.
What, so you're not retired anymore?
Retired life didn't turn out to be what I was looking for, Mr. Matthews.
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to developmental psychology.
I'm Dean Bolander.
I've had a rotten morning, and I don't check my mood at the door.
Oh, my.
Down, boy.
Our first group project will be an exploration of human nature.
Is a person able to alter a trait ingrained in his behavioral makeup since childhood?
Now, for this study, you will each need to choose a partner.
I call Jack!
What are you doing?
I knew you'd ask Rachel to be your partner, so I got you before you could get to her.
Want to be partners, Mr. Feeny?
Delighted, Miss McGuire.
Why didn't you just ask Rachel before I got the chance?
It's hard to say.
You know, I don't have a lot of control over what goes on up here.
Oh!
A rubber band.
Neat-o!
Ooh, this is a good one.
Who are you?
Cory, this is Camryn.
Camryn, this is my roommate Cory, the rubber band man.
Hi.
Hello.
You know, that rubber band was on the door for a reason, Cor.
A little present for me?
Excuse us.
Come on.
Okay, if there's a rubber band on the door, it means the room is ocupado.
You get it?
Shawn, how can you be with another girl so soon?
I mean, shouldn't there be a more suitable mourning period?
Nobody died, Cory.
Angela and I broke up.
She's fine with it, and I'm fine with it, so why don't you put that back on the door and git!
Hey, Cory, what are you doing?
What is that, a rubber band?
It's mine.
It has nothing to do with what's behind the door.
Shawn got a girl in there?
Don't be silly, Angela.
I was just exercising.
Feel the burn!
You don't have to do that, Cory.
Thanks, but I wasn't just born with this body.
I am okay with it if Shawn has a girl in there.
Yeah.
He said you would be.
He did?
Yeah, well, it's none of my business anyway.
Why should I care?
Because you should care.
Listen, Angela, I don't understand how you can both be so calm about this.
Oh, drop it, Cory.
I'm fine.
Because if it's bothering you, you should really tell me.
There's nothing to tell, okay?
I mean, it's not bothering me, so why should it bother you?
I'm just trying to be a friend.
Yeah, well, I appreciate it, Cory, but let's not kid ourselves.
You and I were never really friends to begin with.
What?
How can she not like me?
How can she say I'm not her friend?
I'm Cory!
Cory, you know Angela likes you.
She just doesn't really know you well.
I mean, you have to admit you never took the time to get to know her.
Topanga, what are you talking about?
I mean, she's been going out with my best friend for over a year!
When the four of us went out, how many times did you pull her aside and talk to her?
Not once, Cory.
You never took the time to get to know her.
Well, you know, she never took me aside either.
Well, then let it go.
Oh, when do I ever let anything go?
We have the room to ourselves.
What?
How can she not like me?
Good morning, class.
Class?
Class!
Everybody pipe down!
They're all yours.
You've done this before, George?
She knows my name.
All right.
Let's see what you got.
Any brave volunteers to start us off?
What are you doing?
Trust me.
Teachers love the firsters.
Dean Bolander will be very impressed with our initiative, and we will set an impossible standard for the rest of the class.
George and Rachel.
Let's hear it.
No, I can't go first.
I don't like first.
I can't.
We have a great presentation.
Now, you can do it.
Come on.
You know something, Dean, if these two aren't ready, I think Jack and I are ready to prove that What was our thing?
Well, here we are, right?
And you're fine.
So go ahead.
You do it.
You.
You.
Uh, it is our postulation that, uh, free will determines behavior and not one's environment.
Rachel?
Uh And we will prove And, uh, we're going to prove that Oh, I'm so nervous, Mr. Feeny.
Uh, we will prove that strength of character is the predominant force.
For example, if a reformed criminal returns to his old neighborhood, does that mean that he will necessarily return to a life of crime?
Anyone?
Mr. Hunter.
Um, no.
No, not if he's determined not to.
Very good, Mr. Hunter.
Very good, Mr. Suck-up-to-the-teacher.
He's not the teacher.
Well, then why did you answer him?
His will is too strong.
So, George, you're suggesting that environment has no effect on behavior?
There will be ample time for questions after my presentation.
And a hand raise wouldn't kill you.
Excuse me?
Oh, my goodness.
Uh, Dean Bolander, I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.
I apologize.
Uh, Rachel, would you please continue with our thesis?
I can't.
Yes, you can!
You're an excellent student and very well-prepared.
No, no.
I mean, I can't continue with our theory.
But I think I can do the presentation now.
See, as my partner demonstrated, our theory was all wrong.
I beg your pardon?
Environment obviously has a stronger effect on behavior than we realized.
But you're not nervous now.
You have overcome your environment.
Yeah, but you haven't.
Come in.
Hey, Angela.
Oh, look.
I see you got my flowers.
But, uh, who sent you these balloons?
Oh, look, I did.
"From your friend Cory.
" Cory, I don't want you to send me anything.
Well, it's too late.
What are you doing?
Trying to study.
Hey, you remember when we studied for that test together that one time, huh?
Wasn't that something?
We never studied for anything together.
Yeah, but we did other stuff together, right?
Like what?
Oh, I don't know.
Didn't we find out how Stella got her groove back together?
You are so down, my brother.
Angela, listen, I want you to know that your friendship is really important to me.
No matter what happens between you and Shawn.
Where you going?
I'm going to go take a shower.
Why do you have to take a shower now?
Because it's the one place I know you won't follow me.
Angela?
I thought you were scared to death of this place?
I'm more scared of losing you.
Oh, man.
Okay, what do you want with me?
I want to know why you don't want to be friends with me.
I mean, don't you think that I'm worth being friends with?
Cory, this has nothing to do with you.
Oh, it's Shawn, right?
Just because you broke up with Shawn doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
I didn't break up with Shawn.
What do you mean?
He broke up with me.
Can I get back to my shower now?
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Stop!
What do you mean he broke up with you?
He thinks it's mutual.
Because that's what I want him to think.
Look, please don't ask me about this.
Why didn't you just tell him that you don't want to break up with him then?
Oh, yeah, that's every girl's dream, to beg somebody to stay with her.
Look, he needs his space.
He wants to meet new people.
No.
No, he's wrong.
Come on, you know he's never going to find anybody as good as you.
You don't even know me.
Fine.
You're right.
I don't even know you.
Then why don't you give me a chance to know you?
You know, maybe Shawn's right.
We've all been together so long You know, it's just time for us to Shut up.
What?
Shut up.
You couldn't be more wrong.
Friendship is exactly what's going to get us all through this.
Cory And I am never going to go away.
You just don't get it, do you?
It's hard enough being in the same school with him.
In the same class with him.
And just when I get a moment where I'm not thinking about him, you want to come out and play?
How do you expect me to hang out with you and not think about him?
Because I'm not Shawn.
I'm me.
And I know that if you just let me be friends with you, I promise I can make things better for you.
You want to be my friend?
Yeah.
And you're going to keep to yourself how I feel about him?
Yeah.
'Cause I don't want him to stop looking for who he is because he feels sorry for me.
Okay?
So you promise me you're not going to say anything about this ever.
I won't say anything about this.
To anybody?
Can I talk about it with Topanga?
Topanga doesn't know.
Why not?
'Cause I haven't told her.
She's your best friend.
Right.
And you haven't told her?
Right.
But you told me.
Thanks.
It'll just be a secret between friends.
Come here.
So, in conclusion, watches, chocolate, cheese.
Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Swiss.
Thank you.
Eric, we were supposed to prove something.
He did.
Okay, folks, I think that's about all we can take today.
I'll see you all on Thursday.
Uh, I am so sorry.
I bet you have a really strong first impression of us, huh?
Indelible.
You know something, Dean?
This didn't all come from me.
My boy Jackie here deserves the same grade I do.
Done.
George.
George, may I have a word?
You want me to stay after school?
No, no, nothing so severe.
That was, um, that was quite a presentation.
I don't know what got into me.
Well, I think what got into you was something that never really left you.
I intended to come here strictly as a student.
I thought I had retired from teaching.
Yes.
Well, when I stopped teaching to become dean, I thought the same thing, but here I am.
We're teachers, George.
You put us in a classroom, we teach.
Yes, well, after all these years, I still have a lot to learn.
I'm sorry, Rachel.
I guess I was a poor choice for a partner.
You know, I got to admit, I'd much rather have you as a teacher than as a partner.
I'd rather have him as a colleague than a student.
Perhaps you'd care to call my office about that.
Well, you have my gratitude, Dean Bolander.
You're welcome, George.
I look forward to your call.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Feeny!
Fee-hee-hee-hee-ney!
Ow!
Heh, heh, heh, what?
Wha-wha-what-what?
Hey!
Dude, let's go.
Cory, I'm really glad that you've gotten over your fear of the bathroom, but that's your fifth shower today.
I'm the cleanest boy in school.
So, you know that guy Tim in our econ class?
I was thinking maybe he and Angela could What do you think?
No!
He's not right for I mean, she's not right for him.
I mean, I don't think we should be setting up Angela so quickly.
Hey, Cory, what, do you, like, live here now?
No, no.
You know, I don't know what I was so afraid of.
These co-ed bathrooms are a sensational concept.
Yeah.
Just think, if these things catch on, they'll be putting them in people's homes.
What a terrific idea!
Hey, guys.
Hey, Angela.
Hey.
So, Cory, what's up?
Nothing.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Now, this happens to be my favorite room in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
These abstracts are open to personal interpretations, so I want each of you to pick out a piece of artwork that speaks to you.
Then speak to us about how it speaks to you.
Hey, guys.
Shawn and I have great news.
Hey, me, too.
Shawn just got into the photography program.
And Angela got an A on her essay, "Maintaining black identity "when you have three very white friends.
" That's great, you guys.
Cory, what was your good news?
I found a penny.
Oh.
That's great, too.
All right.
Who'd like to be first to offer an interpretation of this for the class?
Oh, pick me, Mr. Feeny, please!
Please!
Put your hands down.
Please!
Well, how can I turn down that kind of enthusiasm?
All right, Mr. Matthews, give us your interpretation.
I see hands tearing at the fabric of America.
You can almost see the old and bitter artist as he predicts total anarchy and higher taxes and the death of the American way.
Excuse me, but that's totally wrong.
Are you lost, little girl?
The painting is about the hope for the future and the joy of life, and the artist is not bitter.
Look, little girl.
You're a little girl.
Huh!
I'm 18 years old, and you're gonna try and tell me something?
No, no, no.
You just take your little "joy for life" and pipe it, sister!
What's your problem?
No problem.
Keep talking.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Excuse me, Mr. Mean Man, but I know exactly what's in the painting.
Oh, was I "Mr. Mean Man"?
Was I too mean to the "little girl," hmm?
Go ahead.
You tell me how you know what's in the painting.
Go ahead.
I painted it.
Yeah, you painted it, and I got your nose.
I got your nose!
Mr. Matthews, give her back her nose.
Oh, I'm just playing with the kid.
Cory, I believe the kid whose nose you hold is Alexandra Nechita.
Alexandra Nechita?
Hello.
See, this isn't really your nose.
It's my thumb, and Here.
Miss Nechita, I'm a great admirer of yours.
I'd be very interested in hearing your thoughts about classic versus modern technique and the impact of the renaissance on the modern palette.
Feeny.
You're drooling, man.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hunter, but I get carried away when I see a young person with such extraordinary gifts.
Are you saying we don't have extraordinary gifts, Mr. Feeny?
No, of course not, Mr. Matthews.
You also have extraordinary gifts.
Like what?
You have your health.
Good for you.
Step aside while I talk to the genius.
What are you doing in Philadelphia?
There's a showcase of my earlier work.
Ah.
Well, this is extraordinary.
Wow.
She has earlier work.
Wait a minute.
I'm 18, and I have no work at all.
It's okay, Cory.
Everybody can't be a great painter.
Yeah, but she's, like, as old as my sister, and she already knows what she's good at.
I wonder what I'm good at.
You have a sister my age?
Oh, don't.
Don't even bother.
Hey!
Hey, wait.
I know who you are.
You're that painter girl I saw on Rosie O'Donnell.
Morgan, this is Alexandra.
Hi.
Hi!
For some reason, she wants to hang out with you.
Well, when I go on all these tours, I don't get a lot of time to spend with kids my own age.
Have you really been painting since you were, like, two?
My parents gave me a coloring book and crayons when I was two, and I guess I just never stopped.
Really?
'Cause, you know, when Morgan was two, she gained almost full control of her neck.
Yeah, we're all real proud of her.
Go ahead, Morgan, hold up your head.
That-a-girl!
When I was one and a half, I learned to ignore him.
Loser.
So, you like video games?
Yeah, she likes video games!
Morgan, she's a cultural icon.
She's got lots of Banjo-Kazooie?
Got it.
Oh, cool.
Did you get to the witch's tower?
Twice.
Will you show me how?
Yeah!
Let's go.
Hey, Cor.
What you doing?
Shawn, do you think I'm talented?
Oh, God.
What now?
Can you believe how tough Peterson's econ class is?
How am I supposed to know what effect the devaluation of the Russian ruble has on the Asian market?
I mean, please.
Why don't you just go pee?
You would love that, wouldn't you?
He's afraid to leave us alone for a couple minutes.
Oh, yeah, like you've ever left me alone with her for any minutes?
You know, actually, you know what?
I'm okay.
I'm good.
All right!
Totally good.
Eric's okay!
Whoo!
Hey, let's have a little toast to, um, Eric being okay.
Hey, everybody, drink up!
Yo!
Mmm!
That is the meanest thing you've ever done to me.
He is so funny.
Like he has to worry about us being alone together, right?
Yeah.
I want you to marry me.
What?
Yeah, marry me now before he comes out of the bathroom.
Okay.
But, you know, I hope you want kids, because I want six boys and six girls.
Look, I know this is very sudden, but I need you to hurry up and answer me before he comes out of the bathroom.
That's right, cutie pie, I'm talking to you.
"I'm chucking to death.
" Mmm.
Oh!
God!
Oh, God!
Okay!
Whoo!
Monsoon season is officially over, man Hey!
Wait a minute!
Hey!
You said you weren't gonna do anything!
She was chucking to death!
Oh, my God, you saved my life!
No, he didn't!
Forget about it.
You would've done the same for me.
No.
If I can do anything to repay you, I will, 'cause I owe you.
I owe you big time.
I am never gonna pee again!
And this is my eighth-place trophy for enthusiasm from fat camp.
When were you fat?
My parents applied to the good camps too late.
Man, those guys could eat pie.
What's that one for?
Um, my baseball team came in last.
They actually gave you a trophy for that?
Well, they wanted everybody to feel a sense of pride and achievement.
Where's his head?
I smashed it off with a hammer.
Cory, I know I'm supposed to make you feel better, but what kind of loser saves all these things?
Because this was me, Shawn.
This is me.
Mr. Average.
My room here is a shrine to my mediocre life.
Let's stop right there, okay?
You don't have a mediocre life.
There's nothing about me that separates me from anybody else.
You know, nobody ever put a paint brush in my hand when I was two.
Nobody ever helped me find out what I was talented at.
Wait.
You used to be pretty good at this thing.
My dog has fleas Wow.
My dog has fleas Yes!
Your father and I ran into Mrs. Eichelburger at the grocery store.
Her daughter's the reason you didn't enter the talent show at the youth center, isn't she?
Guys, Eloise Eichelburger wins that talent show every year.
Why should anyone else bother to try?
Oh, Morgan, you are such a good singer.
It would be a shame for you not to even try.
Well, I'm sure Alexandra wants you to try.
I mean, do you think she'd let it stop her from painting because there are other girls who could paint better than she could?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
Oh, sure.
There are many girls who can paint better than I'm not supposed to lie.
What do I do?
Go play.
Mom, do I have to sing?
Oh, Morgan, nobody's gonna force you to do anything you don't want to do.
You don't want to sing, you don't have to sing.
Oh, that's right.
And tell her she doesn't have to continue with her ukulele lessons, either.
What?
Way to groom another eighth-place honorable mention, nothing special also-ran, Dad.
Okay, what now?
"What now"?
"What now"?
I could've been one of the greatest ukulele players in the world.
Are you getting that this isn't about the ukulele?
I could've been great at something, and you stopped me.
We didn't stop you.
You just lost interest.
Oh, well, how come you didn't give me a paint set when I was two?
'Cause you were more excited about toilet training.
"Cory big boy now," you would say.
Oh, "Cory big boy now.
" You know, why didn't you ever push me to be anything great?
You didn't help me find out what I was good at.
And I do not want to be one of these people, Dad, who has no first-place trophies and no special talents.
I mean, why didn't you want me to be better?
Better?
Better than what?
Better than what I am.
What are you saying?
I'm saying better than this.
You mean better than me?
Yeah.
Better than you.
Cory!
No, it's just I'm never gonna be great at anything because I was raised to be average.
And I'm average because you're average.
Cor!
Come on, you gotta come out sometime.
Hey.
Look who it is.
It's the ice-cream man.
Well, hello, Mr. Ice-cream Man.
What's that?
Cor, he says he's got your favorite flavor.
Vanilla?
What's going on?
Oh, he's locked himself in there, and he won't come out for anybody.
He's searching the caverns of his soul.
Oh, no.
Not the caverns.
Cory, open this door!
There's no ice-cream man.
I know, Cory.
I did a terrible thing.
I mean, I did the worst thing that I could possibly do.
I told my father he was average.
I told my dad that once.
He was thrilled.
Well, my dad wasn't thrilled.
I mean, he was crushed.
I crushed my father.
I crushed my father.
Cory, we all say things we don't mean.
He'll understand.
Just apologize.
I meant what I said.
I feel like I'm just a regular guy like my father's just a regular guy.
How do I apologize for that?
Oh, Cory, you're not just a regular guy.
You're very good at a lot of things.
Like what?
Don't press me on this.
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
Look, you all know exactly what you're good at, right?
I have no idea what I am.
I'm like standard issue.
I come in a plain wrapper.
Well, so do dirty magazines, and everybody loves them.
Okay.
Not you.
Go home and talk to your father, Cory.
I can't.
He's gonna kill me.
No, he won't.
An average father might be angry, but your father isn't average.
So go home and find out how wrong you are.
We'll be behind you the whole way.
How you doing?
Get in the car.
What are you gonna ask her for?
Leave me alone.
What are you gonna ask her for?
Will you stop?
What are you gonna ask her for?
All right, you want the truth?
I can't handle the truth!
Rachel, will you come out here for a minute, please?
Wait, it's pay-up time right now here in front of me?
So have you decided what you want for saving my life?
Yes, I have.
Come here.
Right here in front of me?
Look, I appreciate your gratitude, and, uh, well, I've decided that what I would like is A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
No!
Don't give yourself to him just 'cause he saved your life!
Life is to live!
Life is You say a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Is that all you want?
Mmm.
Okay.
She'll give you anything you ask for, and you ask for a PB and J?
I don't want her to feel like she has to owe me something.
Well, then, why did you save her life?
Oh, you would've done the same thing, Eric.
Oh, what, just because I like her and I respect her and I wouldn't want to take advantage of her?
Yeah, that.
Actually, could I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, too?
Um I realize you're angry, and, Dad, whatever we're doing here, I want you to know I said a terrible thing, and I have no idea where to even begin to apologize.
I'm sorry you meant it.
Do you know what this place is?
The abandoned warehouse where no one will hear my screams?
My first job was sweeping up this store.
I took over after my father retired.
He spent 40 years with a broom in his hand.
I wish he could see all that I have now.
Why are you so ashamed of being average?
Well, I'm not Look at this place.
Look at this place.
Touch it.
Go on, touch it.
Get some dirt on your hands.
Try and see what average looked like from here.
To me, average Average was a dream.
That's why my father worked his butt off, so maybe his son could have something more.
And I learned from him, Cory.
And I respected him because he did the best that he could.
And I was proud of him.
And he would've been proud of me, too.
I don't know.
You know, maybe If my son thinks average is nothing, then I've done my job.
But I'm sorry that you're not proud.
Of him, of me, and of yourself.
Big deal.
So she twirls batons.
Wow!
Look at all that fire in the air.
Dad Look, Dad No.
She's good.
I know.
She's the best fire juggler in the county.
She's gonna win.
I'm not gonna sing.
You're not gonna sing?
I don't want to.
Aren't there times when you don't want to paint?
Well, when people first started to make a big deal about it, I didn't want to be different from all my friends.
But I love to paint, and that's why I do it.
Don't you love to sing?
Yeah, I do.
Then that's your gift, Morgan.
And if you're lucky enough that God gave you one, I think that you should share it.
Thank you, Eloise!
That's gonna be a tough act to follow.
Well, we have had quite a night this evening.
We've had fire batons, we had a little boy that juggled the ducks, and a special thank you to the double-jointed Plunket twins.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
And now, our final entry will be Morgan Matthews, who will sing a song.
Yay, Morgan!
Mommy loves you!
I can't live like this.
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
But I am worried about it.
Morgan, you were terrific.
Thanks.
How was I?
I'm not supposed to lie.
What do I do?
Let's just go.
Dad?
Hmm.
I think I said all that stuff earlier because I was afraid about my life.
You know, when you meet somebody great like Alexandra, you begin to wonder if you're worth anything, and if I'm not, it was easier to blame you.
But I know it's up to me to make my life something to be proud of.
Well, that's what life is about, Cory.
You spend your time searching for something to give your life meaning.
Some people find it in their talent.
Yeah, but what if I'm not talented?
Other people find it in other ways.
You know when I knew my life was worth something?
When I held you in my arms.
Now, how'd you know I was gonna say that?
That's what my daddy always says to me.
Eric!
Oh, Eric, my poor Eric, are you okay?
Wake up!
What's going on?
Eric's dead.
Cool.
Wait a second, I think he's alive.
What can I do for him?
Oh, I know.
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Oh, shoot.
You know what?
I don't know mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Do you know CPR, jack?
Say "yes.
" Yes, I do.
So just, uh, move aside there, sweetheart.
Oh, yeah, that's good.
Make fun of the dead.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
All right, everyone in place.
Here we go.
And action!
Hello.
I'm Topanga Lawrence.
Hi, I'm Cory Matthews.
We'll be hosting your hosts on this historic tour of Pennbrook College.
For over a century, Pennbrook has been a place where thousands of students come each fall to embark on a journey.
A journey that will take them to a ugiverse of exciting experimences.
So if Pennbrook is the college of your choice Then come on.
Cut!
Cut!
You think?
Where've you been?
I stink.
I think I said the word "Ugiverse".
Shall we try it one more time?
Maybe take 59 will be the charm.
No, no.
I knew way back at take 33 I was sucko.
I quit.
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.
Cory and I were picked as the perfect freshman couple because of our natural chemistry.
Yeah, where'd that go?
Cory, come on, don't leave yet.
I want to hear you butcher the word "Curriculum".
Oh, yeah?
If curricum is such an easy world, then let's hear you say it.
Curriculum.
Wow.
Do that again.
Curriculum.
Wow.
I like it.
Hey, you wouldn't possibly consider, uh What a great idea!
Shawn, you could take my place.
Perfect.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't feel comfortable doing this unless Cory is gonna do it.
Cory, I can't be you.
Shawn, listen, I don't want to be responsible for ruining this film.
Listen, you can take my place.
And besides, Topanga will be here.
She'll make you feel comfortable.
I think it's a bad idea.
Oh, when did I ever have a bad idea?
The social life at Pennbrook University will lead to lifelong friendships, and who knows?
Maybe more.
Right, honey?
That's right, snookums.
Why, I remember the first night we met, right here in the newly remodeled student union, paid for by a generous donation of Mrs. Stanley Kandelman, class of '48.
Don't they look great together?
You know, they really do.
I just meant they do.
I don't mean they really do.
In fact, many students wind up meeting their lifelong mates here at Pennbrook.
And while that may not be the number-one reason to attend Pennbrook College It sure ranks high on our list.
Well, that went well.
Okay, let's have a nice kiss.
What?
Kiss her.
No, don't!
Come on, more heat.
Come on, you're in love.
Less heat!
Lesser!
Oh, that's hot.
That's very hot.
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Back away from the girlfriend!
What was that?
What?
What "what"?
You know what!
You kissed my girlfriend!
He told me to.
If he told you to put a knife through my heart, would you do it?
It depends.
Would you be yelling in my ear through a bullhorn at the time?
I don't like that you kissed my girlfriend.
It didn't mean anything.
Cory, this is silly.
Please don't go crazy over this.
Please.
Please don't go crazy over this.
Please.
Oh, that's right.
Kiss him again, you little Oh, you hurt me so bad.
And you!
You best friend- gigolo-home wrecker.
Why don't you take her back to your tornado-infested trailer park?
Topanga!
Shut up!
You shut up!
No, you shut up!
No, you shut up!
No, you!
You shut up first!
No, you!
No, you!
Come on!
You want a piece of me?
I'm not going anywhere!
Come on!
Hello.
Mmm.
Mmm, that's good.
Ooh, Rachel, another splash of tomato?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thanks, Eric.
I really have to get to class.
Oh, here you go.
Let me get this for you.
Oh, Jack, you know you really don't have to do that.
Oh, you kidding?
I'm happy to do it.
My first class doesn't start for another hour.
My first class is probably over by now.
Well, you know, can't we just wait till we get home to do the dishes?
You know, look, you guys, if you're doing this for my benefit, it really is not necessary.
For your benefit?
Doing this for you?
No.
See, we do this for ourselves.
It's called personal pride.
Okay, well, I'm going to go to class now.
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.
Put the bag on there.
Thanks.
Hey, have a great day.
Thank you.
Make a new friend.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, thanks.
You go for it.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh.
Boy, I've been holding that in for three weeks!
She's killing us, man, with this cleaning and consideration.
I'm telling you something, manners blow.
"If you're doing this for my benefit, "it really isn't necessary," my butt.
Who does she think she is?
We know what women expect.
Yeah, does she think she's the first woman we've ever lived with?
Dude, I lived with my mother for 18 years.
Women thrive on guys being all proper and crap.
Yeah, I'm telling you something, she don't want to see the real us.
My mother never did.
Yep.
Well, mothers can't leave.
Hottie-hot roommates have no such allegiance.
You're right.
You're right.
And if we want to keep Rachel here, we can never, never show our real selves.
I love your mother.
Wait a minute.
Rachel's not here anymore.
What are we still doing with our pants on?
After you.
Why, thank you.
Tramp, man!
I hear you, brother.
I never saw it coming, Isaac.
You can't blame yourself, little buddy.
The same thing happened to me once.
Topanga!
Fred!
Shawn?
Wake up.
No, clown, no!
You slept on the couch?
Oh, yeah, I had to.
He, um, installed a deadbolt.
Yeah, I know.
He's been avoiding me since the incident, too.
What do you think his next move's going to be?
Well, you know him as well as I do.
Yeah, he's probably let it eat at him all night.
Yeah, and by now he's way out of control.
Well, it's probably no surprise to you that I've had a long, hard night and a lot of time to think.
And I know that the two of you are thinking that the crazy little man would dwell and stew and blow all this horribly out of proportion.
But I want you to know that I've worked through it, I'm fine, and I am a happy, healthy Cory.
And I just want to ask one thing.
What's this?
No, Cory, we were just Underpants!
I always sleep like this.
Underpants!
Oh, here we go.
Okay, here's how we're going to handle this.
Now, it's very clear that the two of you have had a lot of hidden sexual tension for the last 15 years.
No, we haven't.
I am speaking now.
Now, there is one solution to this and one solution only.
I want you two to go out on a date.
What are you talking about?
You're going out on a date, and you're going to explore your feelings.
There are no feelings.
There are feelings.
Maybe you don't think there are feelings, but the tape says there are.
I should know.
I watched it 512 times.
Now, when you kissed each other, you felt something.
You both did.
We're not going out on a date.
You're gonna go out on a date, otherwise it's going to haunt us for the rest of our lives.
Why does everything have to haunt us for the rest of our lives?
Underpants!
Will you go out on a date with me?
Yes.
I knew it!
Come in.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you studying?
White history.
You know, you people contributed quite a bit to this country.
Thanks.
But I got my own problems.
Now, I've kept you in the dark about this because even though you and Shawn broke up, I know how much you still care about him.
And you, of course, know how much I care about that betraying witch of a girl Get to the point.
Shawn and Topanga are out on a date.
They would never do that.
It's true.
Well, why would they Because I made the reservation.
Well, what And I paid for it.
Why did you I ordered the souffle in advance.
Why?
Because you have to do that sort of thing, Angela.
Cory, why?
I don't know.
Call the restaurant.
Gosh, the love of my life is out with my best friend, and you want to discuss dessert policy.
Jeez, you're annoying.
Cory, is this still about this kiss?
Wait a minute.
She told you about it?
Well, that means it must have meant something to her.
Let me ask you this.
In all the time that you were with Shawn, did he ever call out the name Topanga?
No, but he called out the name Cory.
In what context?
In the context of how stupid you are.
No, no, no, no.
You weren't there, Angela.
You didn't see them kiss each other.
It was a movie!
There was passion.
They were acting.
They were pretending.
They weren't pretending.
I know when Topanga pretends.
I've been there.
Oh, Cory, you have nothing to worry about.
They're going to go out on this date, spend the evening talking about you and have a terrible time.
You really think so?
I know so.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Angela.
You're really great to talk to.
You are so funny, Shawn.
Oh, stop.
You moron.
Well, he's not here.
Let's go in.
Okay, but we should put a rubber band on the door, just in case he comes back.
After you.
This is the greatest night I've had in a long time.
I mean, to realize how we feel about each other after all these years.
We should thank Cory.
Topanga, I'm not sure we should be doing this.
After all, he's my best friend.
Hey, he's my fiance and I'm fine with it.
You're right.
We can't fight what we've been fighting for 15 years.
I'm just not strong enough anymore.
I can't just sit here and watch your beautiful skin and silky hair and perfect face and long, long legs Isn't there anything you want to say about my eyes?
Yes!
Yes.
The number of eyes on your face That's nice.
Nice?
Yes, but enough about your eyes.
How do you like what I'm doing to you right now?
Ooh, Topanga like.
How do you like what I'm doing to you?
Oh, more!
More!
Oh, Shawn!
Oh, Shawn!
Surprise!
Where'd he go?
Mmm.
Nice spaghetti, Jack.
Thank you, Eric.
Lovely job on the mashed potatoes.
And where did you get this gravy?
Heaven?
You know, funny little story.
I was watching Martha Stewart today, and I got a lovely tip on how to freshen our potpourri with cranberries and lilac petals.
Oh, yes, I saw that one.
Oh.
How was your day, Rachel?
I had lunch with a friend.
We put our elbows on the table, and we ate with our fingers.
You guys don't think I know what you're doing?
What are you talking about, doing?
You actually think that I think that you live like this?
You're just treating me differently because I'm a woman.
Shows how much you know.
What, you think you're the first woman we've ever lived with?
Hmm.
Besides your mothers, yes.
Is that an accurate count, Jack?
I stayed with Nana Boo Boo once.
Now, there's a woman.
I hate this.
It's like I have to be on my best behavior.
It's like I'm living with my mother.
Actually, do you have a picture of your mother?
No reason.
You know what?
I can't do this.
I can't.
You have to be yourselves so I can be myself.
If she's telling the truth, our lives are perfect.
Yeah, well, she's not.
She's testing us.
Just stick with the plan.
Stop!
Stop planning!
Ooh, stop acting like I can't hear you.
We're afraid to be ourselves.
Because we're slobs.
There, I said it.
And you're afraid that I can't handle it, right?
Oh, you could never handle it.
Oh, because I'm a woman?
Because I'm a woman you think that you're going to offend me or something.
Well, you know what?
I can be just as big a slob as the two of you.
That's insane.
Apparently I've got meatball on my face.
Martha Stewart says a lovely blend of bleach and turpentine really clears that up Stick with the plan.
No matter what happens.
Oh!
Do I have my feet on the table?
You know what?
My mother always says, never put your feet on the table, unless they're in marinara sauce.
Right away, I don't like the way this is going.
That's it.
New plan!
You jerk!
No!
No!
Oh!
Stupid!
Ow!
Ow!
I'm gonna murder you!
Pie her!
Pie her!
Pie her.
Pie!
Yeah!
Don't treat me special 'cause I'm a woman.
She's right.
I'm not your mother, I'm your roommate.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Now hit Jack with the pie.
No!
And when I get out of the shower, I expect this place clean.
Yes, Mommy.
Good pie.
What happened?
You know, I don't know, but I think we won.
I heard sounds, Angela.
Forbidden sounds.
I think there was a cow in there.
Cory, you're letting your imagination run away with you.
Really?
Go ahead.
Tell me there's nothing going on in there.
Go ahead.
There's nothing going on in there.
Oh, no.
They're nestling.
I'm opening the door.
No, I don't want to see.
There's no one here.
Of course not.
We're talking about Shawn and Topanga.
They don't care about each other because they care about you.
No, Angela, you are thinking about this too logically.
And this defies logic.
This is raw, hot, unfiltered passion.
And that kiss opened the gates.
There are no gates.
Oh, there's gates.
Cory, don't we know each other a long time?
Yeah.
Well, is there any tension between us?
Well, there was that one time that you didn't get me a gift for my birthday.
I mean, I didn't say anything, but, ooh.
Not that kind of tension.
Oh, you mean I mean, have you ever thought of me in a way other than just a friend?
Never!
Tell the truth.
One time.
Really?
Yeah, but it wasn't my fault.
See, I had a dream, and you were in it.
Was it a good dream?
Yes.
Was it real?
No.
Neither was the kiss.
Yeah, but they It happened.
And they felt something.
How do you know?
Because you can't do something like that without feeling anything.
Even if they're just friends?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, no.
It's the dream.
Wow!
What?
Nothing.
No, tell me.
No, I mean, I felt nothing.
I mean, it felt good and everything, but not Like you and Topanga?
Yeah.
Not like me and Topanga.
Yeah.
Well, that's because you love Topanga, Cory, and when you're with her you feel something for her.
And that's why it doesn't matter that she kissed Shawn, because she only feels something for you.
So even a kiss like you and I just had is just a kiss between friends Because you don't love me.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Well, it's okay, I've been getting a lot of that lately.
Well, you don't deserve it.
You know you're a great person.
Thanks for talking me down.
Come here.
Hey!
What?
What about when I walked in and Shawn was in his underpants?
Cory, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with Topanga, don't you think you should trust her more?
Oh, nobody would trust anybody they caught in such a compromising position.
There you are.
We've been looking all over for you.
I can explain.
Shawn, I found him.
He's in bed with Angela.
Oh, they're so cute.
Make fools out of us, will she?
Wants us to behave like ourselves, does she?
We're gonna smoke her when she gets out of that shower.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
She's been in there an awful long time, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Well, you know women.
They like to loofah.
Takes longer?
Oh, yeah.
But think about it.
The cleaner she is, the better it's gonna be.
Whoo!
Yeah!
She's been in there an awfully long time.
Well, yeah, but she's got to come out here sometime, doesn't she?
And when she does, we will be ready.
Are we going to be here?
Oh, yeah!
I think we are.
I think we are!
Yeah.
Yes!
Wait here a hundred years if we have to.
Yeah.
I'll be out in a minute.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I believe a person is responsible for her own destiny and can be anything she wants, if she wants it bad enough and she never, ever gives up.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Topanga Lawrence, the next president of the United States.
Thank you.
Uh, everybody, that makes me the first lady.
You see how secure I am in my sexuality.
Hello.
Now come on, Topanga.
You really believe all that Little Mary Sunshine stuff?
Yes, I do.
So do I. To a point.
Shawn!
Stuart!
Nice haircut.
Thanks.
Eight bucks.
Looks like it.
Now, Topanga just spouted a philosophical belief.
What is it?
Free will.
Hey, he's a big deal with the new hair.
She's in charge of her own actions and therefore creates her own destiny.
Good hair and good answer.
You believe her?
In my experience, you don't bet against Topanga or you'll get your butt kicked.
I don't doubt it.
Now how about it, Romeo?
You buy what Juliet is saying?
Yeah, I do.
I think you have to have at least some control over the things that happen to you.
Really?
Cory Matthews wakes up one morning.
He kisses his lovely wife.
He leaves his nice suburban home, and then he gets hit by a bus.
I'll miss you, buddy.
No, I don't get hit by a bus.
Why not?
Because I use the crosswalks, I memorize the bus schedules, and if I got a wife like Topanga, I ain't leaving the house!
Bus hits you anyway.
Now, what's that called?
Fate.
Doesn't matter if you stay in or go out, your life is predestined, and there's nothing you can do about it.
So you mean that bus is going to drive right through my house to get to me?
Yes, it is.
I'll miss you, buddy.
All right, guys, we got to get out of here.
Now, uh, I read your papers, and most of them were bad.
This isn't high school anymore.
Free up your minds.
You're smarter than these.
Shawnie!
Shawnie, this guy is awesome.
I've been waiting a thousand years for a teacher like this.
Yeah, high school is amateur night.
It's not like Feeny at all.
He treats us like equals.
Feeny was like a parent.
This guy's a friend.
I know.
You're a good teacher, but a bad pool player.
You owe me a coffee.
All right.
Anybody else?
It's on me.
Coffee.
Coffee.
Coffee.
Hey, guys, I only have two hands here.
Topanga, you want to help me out?
Sure.
You know, actually, I wanted to thank you.
What did I do?
You took my class.
You challenged things.
A teacher likes a student who participates and shakes things up.
Makes class more exciting.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Keep it up.
Five coffees.
"If we don't challenge our leaders, "we have no right to complain over how they lead.
" That's a quote from my paper.
It was a good paper.
You got a little lazy on the summary, but we'll go over it, okay?
How's campus life?
Well, Angela and I are in McKay, so small rooms, lousy food.
Welcome to college.
Good afternoon, Dean Bolander.
Stuart.
George.
What are you drinking, George?
Oh, I'll get it.
New teacher on campus.
I don't know how professional it would be to accept a drink from your boss.
What are you drinking, George?
Double-blended nonfat no-whip frappuccino.
Not used to letting people do things for you, are you?
Well, I usually take care of myself.
Well, just relax.
You're right.
Do you think I could have a biscotti, too?
I'm not rich, Feeny.
I don't like him.
You don't know him, Eric.
He's a very cool guy.
I'm telling you something, Cory.
I have a gift, okay?
I know people.
Hello!
Wow!
Look at that.
How would you like to come home to that every day?
We do come home to that.
It's Rachel!
You unbelievable, incredible buffoon.
Oh, hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Rachel.
No, anyway, I'm telling you, I have a feel for these things, okay?
This guy is no Feeny.
This guy couldn't even clap Feeny's erasers.
Feeny!
Yo!
Having coffee with the dean.
Whoo, Feeny!
You know what, Eric, sooner or later you're going to have to cut this cord from Feeny and see what else is out there.
I'm telling you, if there's one thing I know it's people, okay?
I've lived among them.
It's like a fifth sense.
You mean sixth sense?
No, dude, that's smell.
You got to be lucky to get that.
Anyway, this Stanley guy Stuart!
Stuart guy I'm telling you, he's bad news.
You trust me.
Hey!
Hi!
Oh!
Hey, Stuart.
Hanson, you owe me a paper.
I don't believe in grades, but I'll flunk your butt.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood, and we talked about going over the paper, so, okay?
Great.
Sure.
Thanks.
All right.
Angela, I don't have your paper, but we can discuss what I remember.
Oh, no, that's cool.
We're actually on our way to the student union.
Why don't you go down there and I'll meet you down there later?
Okay.
You two leave the door open.
Oh, get out of here.
Is that your mom?
Yeah.
That was taken on Martha's Vineyard.
She's real pretty.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Topanga, this paper was too good to fizzle out on the conclusion.
You're too smart for that.
Here.
Look.
"It is possible to cross the line morally "and yet not cross the line actually.
" Now, that's vague.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why?
The paper was on morality and ethics, and I was just saying there are definite gray areas.
I know what the paper's about, because, you see, I assigned it.
I just I want you to be more specific.
The devil's in the details.
I'm sitting here with you, for example, right?
Yeah.
I'm your teacher, and I find you attractive.
But we're talking about the assignment.
Now have we crossed the line?
I don't think so, no.
I'm your teacher and I think you're attractive.
And now we're not talking about the paper.
Have we crossed the line?
What?
Okay.
What if I said to you that I think about you, and I'd like to see you more than just on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
See where it gets gray?
When did you go to the Vineyard?
Two summers ago.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Okay, one more.
We're adults and I'm telling you that I'd like to get to know you better.
And that's what I'm going to do.
Stuart, you're making me uncomfortable.
I want you to leave.
That's not what you want.
What?
Hey.
If I wasn't such a trusting boyfriend, this would look bad.
How come you don't make house calls on me, Stuart?
'Cause I'm talking to the brains of the family.
Hey, I'm going to leave you two alone.
Uh, Topanga, we'll finish this later.
Boy, you got to love that.
I mean, Feeny wouldn't be caught dead in a dorm room.
Shawn's right about this guy.
He is in a whole other league.
I didn't like him being here.
I didn't like it at all.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Oh, so you take your middle name and you put it with the street that you live on.
And that's your soap opera name?
Yeah.
Like mine is Kimberly Beaumont.
Jonathan Cumberland.
Eric, your middle name is Randall.
Tony Randall.
The Odd Couple!
Don't you listen to the rules?
Who is Tony Randall?
Right.
You win.
I always win.
Stuart, Stuart.
Hey!
Hey, Romeo.
Listen, can I talk to you on the patio for a second?
Cory, your paper was pedestrian.
This isn't high school anymore.
You gotta take chances.
We're not talking about the paper.
Yeah?
Yeah, uh, Topanga's real uncomfortable about your dorm visit.
Why?
She thought you were hitting on her.
What if I was?
"What if I was"?
My soap opera name is Patrick Trailer Park.
Well, mine is Shanaynay Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Gosh, I gotta get some black friends.
So, Topanga, what's your middle name?
I don't want to play.
Why not?
I have a weird middle name.
Your first name's Topanga.
What could your middle name be?
Shmuboogie?
Congratulations.
You just got yourself kicked out of college.
How could you do this to Stuart?
Shawn, I don't know, okay.
I've never hit anybody before.
Most of the time when you spin out of control, it's funny.
But this time, I think you went too far.
You could get in trouble for this, Cor.
Hey, no matter what happened, we're behind you.
No matter what happened.
The first time in my life I hit somebody, and it's a teacher.
Oh!
You idiot!
I thought you hit a student.
What on earth could have possessed you to do this, Cory?
You hit a teacher?
What did he say?
Did he threaten you?
No.
Did he hit you?
No.
What did he do?
He made a move on Topanga.
In the class?
No, in her dorm room.
Okay, I saw the whole thing.
I can testify in court.
That teacher hit, I repeat, hit young Cory Matthews.
No, I hit him, Eric.
Yeah, I know, I saw, man.
That dude sailed.
Look, Mom, Dad, you know about my fifth sense, right?
You've told us about it, yes.
I'm telling you something, it's working overtime right now.
I can feel it in my veins.
This guy's bad.
You can't talk to that woman.
She's the dean of the university, and you can't reason with her.
"This is a university.
"The university has rules.
" Well, I have rules, too, missy!
You know what?
This guy knows what he did.
Okay?
And he deserves what he got.
This is all gonna go away.
The dean has scheduled a hearing.
There's a possibility that Cory could get kicked out of school.
Come with me.
Come with me now.
Do it, do it, do it.
Why?
Why are you my friend?
Why can't I have better friends?
Eric.
Eric, what are you doing?
All right, you see that guy over there?
Don't look, don't look.
That's the guy that hit young Cory Matthews.
Now, I have a plan.
You have to listen carefully, because this is extremely complicated.
I want you to go over there and flaunt yourself.
I'm not gonna do that, Eric.
All right, Rachel, you go.
What?
You know, just tease him.
Trap him.
Do what women do.
It's ingrained.
You know, it's the I'm a pretty girl.
Eric, I'm not gonna go over there and flaunt myself.
You will flaunt!
Come here, listen to me.
If there was ever a problem in your family, there's nothing I would not do to help them.
I would go to prison for your family.
Do you know why?
Because we live together, and I feel like I am part of your family.
Except when I dream about you, and you're in that little pink robe, and you start doing that thing Fine!
All right, now here.
Practice on Jack.
Oh, Eric.
Practice!
Okay.
Hi, Stuart.
How are you doing?
I hear you're a really good teacher.
I'm more woman than that.
Shut up!
Sorry.
What did you say?
Wait a second.
What, am I too tall for you?
Is it the fiery red hair?
Is the little boy afraid of a commitment?
Well, you know what?
I will not allow you to reject me.
I'm gonna reject you!
You will not hurt me!
Jack, if there was ever anyone in your family I'm not flirting with a guy, okay?
I don't care if they give your brother the chair.
You did cross the line.
You used a position of power unethically, and Cory protected me the only way he knew how.
And now it's my turn to do the same thing for him.
You leave Cory alone.
You make this go away, or I'll tell the dean that you came on to me.
You came on to me.
What?
See you at the hearing.
All right, first of all, this is not a trial, so let's not make a big courtroom drama out of it.
Your Honor, Jonathan Cumberland for the defense.
Unbelievable.
Mr. Matthews, leave.
Mr. Feeny, we're partners, man, you know.
Feeny and Cumberland, Cumberland and Feeny.
Feeny and Feeny and Feeny and Eric.
But mostly Feeny because I love my brother and I want to help.
Thanks, Eric.
Look, Mr. Feeny, I know you got a thing going with the dean, all right, so if it looks like we're gonna lose, just play the love card, okay?
Will you shut up?
Unbelievable.
All right, Stuart, what happened?
I was in the student union when Cory asked me to step outside.
I thought it was to talk about a bad grade I gave him on a paper which I called "pedestrian.
" He then accused me of making a move on Topanga Lawrence and then he hit me.
What were you doing in Topanga Lawrence's room?
I was going over her paper.
In her room?
That sounds odd to me.
My students and I have a relationship outside of the classroom, which allows us to connect better inside the classroom.
Well, ask any of them.
Shawn?
Do you have any problems with my teaching methods?
No.
In fact, didn't you just tell me that I was the best teacher that you ever had?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Why do you think that?
I don't think it really matters what I think.
I'd really be interested to hear your answer.
You treat us like equals.
Like adults.
I guess a lot of teachers, you know, you feel like they treat you like a kid.
Like Mr. Feeny, for example.
Mr. Feeny's a really good teacher.
Yeah, but he He treats you like a kid.
Okay, you made your point, Stuart.
We've had Mr. Feeny in grade school and in high school, too, so maybe he feels like he has to protect us.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Mr. Feeny.
Don't worry about it, Shawn.
How did you know what dormitory Topanga was in?
She told me.
She told me she lived in the McKay dorms.
She offered it to me unprompted.
Isn't that right, Topanga?
Yes, that's true, but that wasn't Thank you.
Did you really think it was proper I mean, I'm talking about simple, human propriety To be in a young female student's bedroom?
A dorm room.
Also serves as a living room.
Or a TV room or a study.
It was not a bedroom when I was in there.
Stuart, do you believe as a college professor that it's okay to be alone in a dorm room with a young female student?
The door was open.
I even asked her roommate to stay.
In fact, it was Topanga who shooed Angela away, isn't that right, Topanga?
She was on her way to the student union.
I didn't feel Thank you.
Any more questions, George?
Just one.
Is it okay if I rip off your head and roll it down the hallway?
George, you and I both know that a teacher is only as effective as the respect he is given, and Cory's show of disrespect undermines me and this university.
And your show of disrespect undermines me.
Miss Lawrence.
You know what you did.
I didn't do anything.
He made a move on Topanga.
On my fiancee.
He used his power and authority to take advantage of her, and he told me that there was nothing I could do and that he was never gonna stop.
So I did something.
I mean, I realize, Dean, that this wasn't the smartest thing in the world to do, but it was all I could come up with at the time.
Striking a member of this faculty is inexcusable, no matter what the provocation.
Can I say something real quick?
Yes.
Cory, it's okay with me that you hit him.
Thanks, Shawn.
It's okay with Shawn.
Well, it's not okay with me.
According to the bylaws of this university, I am bound to expel or suspend any student for striking an educator for any reason whatsoever.
Dean, I beg you to reconsider this.
George, sit down.
You can't protect them anymore.
Cory Matthews, I hereby suspend you from this university for a period of one day.
One day?
You are, however, under probation for the remainder of this term, and I will not take kindly to your solving any more problems with anything but words.
You don't have to worry about it, Dean.
Thank you.
Dean, he hit a teacher.
A teacher must be someone a student can trust.
The second the teacher uses pressure on a student for any reason whatsoever, other than academic, that trust is destroyed.
Well, there must be some sort of misunderstanding, because as a teacher, I Stuart This is a teacher, Stuart.
I'm not sure what you are, but you can be certain I'm going to find out.
This hearing is adjourned.
Everybody go home.
I am so sorry you had to go through all this.
Thanks for sticking by us, George.
You all right, buddy?
Yeah.
Bye, baby.
Bye.
I don't know how I could've compared him to you.
Oh, well I guess, uh, college is a lot different than high school, huh?
I'm afraid so, Cory.
I'm also afraid that the dean is right.
I've tried to protect you for too long in the shelters of high school.
This is a major university, and this is life, and these things happen.
And you're not children anymore.
We're not children anymore.
When did that happen?
I don't know.
Today, I think.
You guys want to get ice cream or something?
Yeah.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
What's it gonna be, Hunter?
Gambling Dan wants to know what it's gonna be, Hunter.
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks.
Let me study your face.
He's studying your face.
What do you see, Gambling Dan?
He got nothing.
You got nothing, you loser.
Let's see your cards.
Turn 'em over.
Three kings.
Oh, no, Gambling Dan.
This has never happened before.
Wow, nice hand, Hunter.
Maybe I did misread you.
Thanks, Dan.
You're welcome.
You still lose.
Flush.
I like the way you play.
Maybe we should hang out more.
Yeah, I like you too, Shawnie.
I was rooting for ya.
Thanks, Louie.
So, uh, maybe you'll join us later at Clevage.
Yeah, I'll see if I'm free.
What's this?
My best friend and roommate hosting a poker game in our room without me?
Oh, hey, it's the Major.
I thought you were with your virgin support group.
Yeah, well, the other guy dropped out.
Nice.
So, uh, see you at 7:00 all right, Shawnie?
And don't bring nobody.
Uh, nothing.
Bunch of us are gonna go to a club.
Really?
And I suppose bunch of us didn't think to invite me either.
Well, I figured you were busy with Topanga.
Well, pal, it just so happens I'm free tonight.
Topanga's busy.
See?
Everything you do is based on Topanga.
Hey, I'm engaged.
I know.
Sometimes I wonder if that ring's not through your nose.
No, it's right here, pal.
But perhaps one of my friends is severely jealous of what I have with her.
No, I'm not jealous, Cory.
I'll be honest with you, okay?
Whenever I'm doing something with the guys, and I say, "Hey, how about Cory comes along"?
Gambling Dan says, "No, not Cory.
He's married.
He's dead.
" Oh, what do I care what Gambling Dan thinks?
Why does he call me the Major?
It stands for "major wuss.
" He says if there was a Whipped magazine, you'd be the centerfold.
Okay, first of all, there is a Whipped magazine.
I didn't subscribe, somehow they found me.
You tell him that.
Yeah, I'll tell him that tonight at Clevage.
Club Clevage?
Where the women parade around in little outfits that barely cover their most private of situations?
And Angela's letting you go?
I'm not with Angela anymore, remember?
You are with Angela.
No, I'm not, Yentl.
Well, you should be.
Cory, even if I was, if I want to go someplace, I go.
Well, I want to go, too.
Uh-huh.
Cory Matthews at Clevage?
You blush at the beach.
Shawn, listen, I don't want to be excluded from all these things just because I'm engaged.
It's not that.
Look, I mean, let's face reality.
I broke up with Angela.
You're still with Topanga.
We're in completely different situations now.
I don't care, okay?
You tell Gambling Dan the Major is going.
And what, may I ask, are you gonna tell your fiancee?
I will tell her what I want to tell her when I choose to tell her or I will tell her or I won't.
It's all up to me.
So you're gonna tell her?
It's out of my hands.
Where you going?
Nothing.
You have no right to judge us.
Yeah, why are you asking so many questions?
We're not hounding you about what you're doing.
I'm doing a midterm paper on the influence of women on male bonding.
There isn't any.
Yeah.
Males were bonding on this planet long before women ever arrived.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
This paper's worth half my grade.
I've been praying to come up with a specific case that I could observe, but so far I haven't.
Look, we're just going out, okay?
We're men doing what men do.
And you know something?
Quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of all the scrutiny, the badgering, the nit-picking.
It's gotta stop.
Don't ask us when we're coming home either, 'cause, quite frankly, it's none of your business.
Yeah.
'Cause we're in college now, huh?
Uh-huh.
You know that?
We're in college.
Oh, yeah!
You're not the boss of us.
Mmm, huh?
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.
Thank you.
What nerve!
Trying to make us feel guilty for going out.
I'm telling you, it's that female intuition garbage, man.
You see, they sense when a man's about to do something fun and they try to spoil it.
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna work on us.
No way, J. Maybe we shouldn't go.
Get in.
There's something you don't see every day.
Yeah, look, an outie.
You know, if the doctor had just tied a neater knot Cory, Cory.
Before we get to the guys, could you age up about 30 years?
Hey, look.
It's Mr. Topanga Lawrence.
What's up, Major?
You're not nice.
Oh, what's the matter, Major, too much action for you?
You didn't get enough love as a child, did you?
Beat him up, Dan.
Naw, I'm sure his wife does that for him, already.
I'm not married, okay?
You see this?
It's an engagement ring.
I'm engaged.
So nuts to you.
You're not helping yourself.
What kind of guy wears an engagement ring?
I mean, come on, what is that?
Cory's just really not like everybody else, you know.
He's unique.
Marches to the beat of a different drummer.
What does that mean?
I hate it when people say crap I don't get.
He's a good guy.
Listen, I don't need you to defend me, Shawn.
Well, look, he's here.
That's a start.
Hey, guys.
Hey, you're new here.
I haven't seen you before.
I'd like a hamburger and French fries.
Cory, Cory, what are you looking at?
The ceiling.
Why?
Because I'm uncomfortable is why.
Hi, how ya doing?
Ooh, I think she likes you, Major.
No.
She doesn't like me.
She doesn't even know me.
I do like you.
He's cute, Danny.
Where you been hiding him?
Oh, he doesn't get out much.
He's married.
No, I'm not married.
Don't listen to him.
I'm just here for a hamburger and possibly the beverage of my choice.
Well, if you're not married, why are you wearing a ring?
Ah, it's an engagement ring.
Oh, this is a bachelor party?
No.
Oh, boy.
No.
Girls!
We got a bachelor party!
The cute one with the curly hair.
Oh, that's good.
Oh, gosh.
Okay.
Okay, girls.
Okay, okay, okay, girls!
This isn't necessary.
Okay, you're all wonderful and special in your own individual ways, but you're smothering me with your Oh, Clevage.
Now I get it.
Cory, enjoy it.
It's just fun.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I mean, this is nice.
It's not so bad, and besides, what bad could happen?
Right, Topanga?
Engaged.
Wrong.
Must poke eyes out.
No, no, Cory, no.
Eye poking bad.
Cory, if Dan sees you bail, there's no way you or I will ever be able to repair the damage done to your reputation.
Shawn, maybe he's right.
Maybe I am just Mr. Topanga Lawrence.
Cory, will you just take the ring off?
Why?
Because it's strangling you.
Good boy.
No, no.
You know what, Shawn?
I don't know about this.
I mean, I want to be one of the guys, but I gotta take my ring off.
I don't feel like I belong here.
I don't feel like you belong here.
I don't even feel like Eric belongs here.
Hey, nurse, how 'bout some chow?
Okay, maybe Eric.
You know, I don't know why we thought we had to sneak out.
I mean, look, this is just a harmless, college-town gathering place.
Uh, yeah, to us.
But Rachel would see this place as a sleazy, low-life den of iniquity.
Hi, could I have a tuna on white?
You want to cut the crusts off that for me and serve it in triangles the way my mommy does?
Thanks, Tiffany.
She'd think this place would be frequented by the degenerate scum of the earth, you know?
Hello.
Cory, what are you doing here?
Why?
Does it strike you as odd that one such as I would be found in a place like this?
Does Topanga know you're here?
Oh, what does it matter?
I'm with the guys tonight.
Hey, does Rachel know you guys are here?
Rachel?
Whoa, whoa.
We don't care what Rachel thinks, okay?
She's just our roommate.
Why would you even ask a question like that?
Well, she looks surprised to see you.
Hey, guys.
Having a good time?
Not anymore.
Think tonight was good for both of us, Cor.
You know, it really put you over the hump with the guys.
Yeah, Shawnie, this may come as a bomb shell, but that guy Dan is a jerk.
Well, Cory, jerk is normal.
This is what single guys do in college.
So this is what you broke up with Angela for?
To hang out with guys like that?
This is what you want?
No, I want you to let me live.
I'm my own man now, okay?
I do whatever I want to do, I go wherever I want to go, and I don't have to answer to anybody.
Where you guys been?
Pig in the City.
Cory, you and I were supposed to see that together.
Well, he'll definitely go again 'cause it was a great movie And he loved it and what's funnier than those mouses, and we all know how I feel about We went to Clevage.
little pink pigs.
You should, 'cause you are one.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
It's just a restaurant.
And besides, you can't be mad at me.
Hello, drama queen, we're not going out together anymore, remember?
We're just friends.
You're right.
You go where you want.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
Cory, can we go inside and talk about this?
No, I'd prefer to talk out here because the light is so lovely.
And you look so lovely, so I think I think we're gonna stay right out here.
Or here is fine.
Cory, why?
Before you say anything, I just want to state that as a man I am entitled to certain rights and privileges.
I understand.
So as a man, I went with other men, and did man things because I do not want to be thought of by those men as How do I put this delicately?
Whipped?
You could at least let me say it.
Cory, I'm not mad at you.
But you're disappointed in me.
I understand your need to be one of the guys.
The only thing that's important to me is that we are always honest with each other, okay?
You're not just being understanding now, but actually harboring bitterness and resentment that'll fester over the years until one day you hack me apart in my sleep, right?
No, Cory, that would be wrong.
Yeah, I mean, you don't go around hacking people, right?
No, you don't.
So let me ask you this.
You think of me as my own man, so I can do anything I want?
I trust you, Cory.
Do whatever you want.
Well, what if I don't want to?
Then you don't have to.
Good.
Because the food is no good and the service is just crazy.
If you think that's best.
I do.
Now come here, huh?
Give me some sugar.
What else is new?
Gambling Dan wants to see you.
He's right there, you pigeon.
He just called me a pigeon.
You are a pigeon.
Then it's true.
Dude, you were the man tonight.
When those waitresses attacked you Okay, I was jealous.
You know, I admit I must've had you pegged all wrong.
Especially, you know, since you stopped wearing that stupid ring.
I mean, come on, what kind of a guy wears an engagement ring?
Yeah.
My ring!
I gotta stop looking to the past.
I need to look to the future.
You know, the future is also no good.
So just because you were all understanding and mature about this, you really think Cory's not gonna go back to that place?
I know he won't, Angela.
It was a one-time guy thing and it's over.
Well, I bet Shawn's back there right now with all the other pervs.
Well, I guess as long as some women choose to wiggle around half naked, there'll be men who go to see them.
Women don't choose to work in a place like that.
They're forced into it by circumstances.
I work there.
Joan, you do?
Yeah, because I need Stop.
You need go no further, my sister.
I know the profile.
Broken home, years of abuse, then a child out of wedlock, forcing you into financial chaos and a life of degradation and sin.
I'm a cook.
It's okay.
Angela's a little bit sensitive these days.
Is this place really that bad?
It's harmless.
I mean, the girls wear more than you'd see them wear at the beach.
I'm on my way to work now.
You want to check it out?
Yeah.
I'm kind of curious to see what Cory finds so fascinating.
You know, I just don't understand it.
We have been here all night and it's like you two aren't having any fun at all.
Well, frankly, we're appalled by what's going on.
Ma'am, I'm not a chair.
Oh, come on, don't let me stop you from having fun.
I'm just observing for my paper, that's all.
For Yeager's class?
Oh, yeah, that's where I know you from.
What's your topic?
Women and their influence on male bonding.
There isn't any.
Now, Ma'am, would you mind covering up.
I'm trying to eat.
Eric, stop it.
Look, all my paper's gonna say is that the two guys that I'm getting to know very well are inhibited in the presence of their female roommate from behaving normally in a male-oriented environment.
That's right.
Thanks to you we understand women a lot better and hold ourselves to a higher standard of morality.
Really?
Yeah, really.
I mean, ever since you moved in, we learned this new maturity.
And every time you're around, well, we're reminded of it.
Oh, I'm flattered.
Thanks, guys.
Oh, good.
You should be.
Now get out, it's time for the tushy dance.
Enjoy.
Excuse me, which way is the lost and found?
Over there next to day care.
Okay.
Hi.
Hey, it's the groom.
You had such a good time you decided to come back for more?
No, no, actually I decided to come back for my ring, which somehow came off during the festive evening that we spent together.
Uh-huh, well, maybe it's in here with all the other rings which just happened to come off.
Ladies and gentlemen, Clevage presents its world-famous tushy dance.
My ring.
I found it!
I found it.
I'm saved!
I found my ring!
Everything worked out!
My tush touched hers.
See, there's nothing shocking here.
Cory, what are you doing?
What are you talking about?
You're tushy-dancing.
I am not.
I'm looking at you.
No, this isn't me.
I really wish you would stop doing this.
Why aren't you wearing your ring?
Oh, I was.
See, I had to come back here to pick it Because I left it and I had to get it back.
Topanga!
Topanga.
Topanga, listen.
There's a perfectly logical reason for what happened.
Really?
I'd love to hear it.
Good, good, good.
You know, this is so funny.
You're gonna laugh, Topanga.
You really are.
See, um I didn't go back to that place tonight to do the tushy dance.
I only went back because I left my ring on the table and I had to go back and get it.
Why would you take off your ring?
Because they were calling me "the Major.
" Listen, there are some places where a guy goes where he feels uncomfortable wearing a ring.
And most guys don't even wear a ring before they get married.
And even some married guys don't wear rings.
Cory, I never asked you to wear an engagement ring.
You saw mine and said, "Pretty, I want one.
" Yeah, that's because I didn't expect all the men to hate me for it.
But you should see them, Topanga.
They really do hate me.
I mean I stick out every place they go together.
Poker games, steam baths, cockfights.
Cory, don't you realize that the people you so desperately want to be accepted by would probably rather have what you have?
What do I have?
Me.
Oh.
I mean, someone who cares about them.
That's all that the ring is about, Cory, that I have somebody that cares about me.
But I care about you whether you want to wear the ring or you don't.
If I want to play poker, I'm playing.
Go.
Play.
And if I want to play me a little touch football on the field with the boys, I'm playing.
You go and run real hard.
And if I want to take my ring off No.
You either wear the ring or you don't.
Why?
Because I have feelings, too, Cory.
Hey, Matthews.
Poker game.
My room.
Dig this, you're actually invited this time.
This is great, man.
There's two poker games on the same day I get my allowance check from Mom.
Yeah, ironic, isn't it?
Hey, Shawnie.
Hey, Cor.
You still hanging out with those guys?
Yeah, it's either that or sleep.
You coming tonight?
Yeah, save me a seat.
But if I don't show up, it's probably 'cause I'm having a better time with somebody else.
Good for you guys.
You know, Shawn, you're always invited to hang out with us.
I know, Cor.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Now, this next poem is quite special.
The manner in which the poet expresses emotions is truly eloquent.
The piece is entitled, "An Unpublished Manuscript for J.D. Salinger.
" Nappy time.
"It is possible to assassinate my heroes "With the scope of my individualism "However, by their own persistence to themselves "I believe that they have chosen me to pursue a self "What is literature, but the illumination of that which I would write?
"Salinger speaks through me, to me "Whispers, 'Where to, little boy?
' "My answer is the dogged pen to page "Which lights consistently the pathway home "It is on that road that I alone "Can trip my way back to myself" Aw, come on!
Would you care to analyze this poem, Mr. Matthews?
Yeah, I'll take a stab.
Stab away.
Ya call that poetry?
Feh!
And all right already with this J.D. Salinger thing.
I mean, hello!
Name-dropping?
And haven't we had just about enough of Catcher in the Rye?
I mean, what's he written lately?
Am I right?
Well, on that note, we will have to pick this up at our next session.
Cory, you're nuts.
That poem was so incredible.
It was beautiful.
I can't believe someone our own age wrote that.
Someone like Mr. Hunter?
What?
Yeah, I wrote that poem.
I knew it.
I liked it.
Do you have any more poems?
I wouldn't really call them poems.
I just write stuff down.
I've been doing it since I can remember.
I can't believe you never told me.
I can't believe you never told me.
I never told anyone, okay?
I just do it for myself, get my feelings out.
Shawn, I host poetry readings at the student union Friday evenings.
If you would feel comfortable sharing some of your I don't know, Mr. Feeny.
It's That sounds awesome.
Perhaps I could read some of my poems, too.
You have poems?
Well, I wouldn't call them poems.
I just I just sort of write stuff down.
I can't wait.
All right!
See you Friday night.
My poems are money because they're so funny.
Well, have fun.
All right.
Hey, Shawn.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Listen, come on.
Don't just blow this off.
Cor, enough with the pressure.
No.
I know you.
If I don't pressure you, you're gonna flake.
Hey, Cory, if Shawn doesn't wanna read his poems, then I think we should respect that.
No.
Because Shawn never wants to do what's best for him.
Come on, Cory, leave him alone.
Shawn, just come with us, okay?
If you wanna read poems, you will, and if you don't, you won't.
Will it shut you up?
Will ya come?
Fine.
He's gonna write a poem in his dorm and not his hoem.
Hey.
All right!
This is so easy.
Enough with the hair!
What?
You heard me.
She couldn't hear anything over that pen.
Click, click.
Click, click, click, click, click, click.
I don't need you to defend me, apple boy.
Crunch.
Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.
Shut up!
Shut up.
Crunch.
Look, I know these finals are worth 90% of our grades, but it doesn't mean that we have to behave as wild animals do.
Talk.
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
Would you shut up and let me study?
Fine.
Great!
That's great.
That's terrific.
Shut up.
Great.
Oh, that's it!
I'm going to the library.
You people are so uptight, I can't even think.
You know how hard that is for me in the first place.
Yes, we do.
Finally.
Now maybe we can get some studying done.
Finally.
I don't know where the library is.
Ah, this is better.
Sorry.
You don't sound sorry.
You sound loud.
Thanks.
Now they hate me, too.
Shut up.
You shut up.
And you shut up.
Everybody, shut up!
Ooh, I hate college!
Pressure.
Pressure.
It's killing me.
What's the matter with him?
How would you like to have a book shoved down your throat?
Hey, wait a second.
He's a friend of mine.
You want a piece of me?
Come back here, you little twerp.
I don't like your face.
I don't like your pants.
Shut up!
What's wrong with my pants?
They're just too tight.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What is happening here?
I'm about to beat the crap out of the troll.
Look what we're doing to ourselves.
I mean, these finals are turning us into monsters.
So what do we do?
That's a good question.
I'd like everybody to take off their left shoe and make a pile right here in the middle of the room right now.
What're you thinking about right now?
My foot's cold.
Exactly.
You're not thinking about the you-know-what.
What?
Can't say it.
Look, we all know how important these you-know-whats are to our futures, not only here at Pennbrook, but for the rest of our lives.
But the only way we're gonna do well is if we relax.
You know, we calm down a little bit.
We stop biting each other's heads off, and who knows?
Maybe we can even have a little bit of fun, huh?
That's what I call the Eric Matthews foolproof study system.
Hello, I'm Eric Matthews.
First things first.
Rachel, I want you to shake hands with the troll.
Then I want everybody to come down here and grab a shoe.
You will find who owns that shoe and take 'em to the movies.
Come on, go.
Eww.
There's gum all over this one.
Do you like popcorn?
Do I. Crunch during the movie, I'll push your nose into your brain.
All day long, I think of you How do you do the things you do?
I love you, girl, with all my heart Because you're pretty And you're smart Topanga!
It's a tough room.
The final poet for this evening will be Mr. Shawn Hunter.
I can't believe you.
When are you ever gonna learn to stay out of my business?
Mr. Hunter?
Come on.
We're all here for you.
You don't know it, but sometimes You don't know it, but sometimes, I I'm sorry.
I can't.
It's okay, everybody.
It's okay.
Huh?
Cory's here.
Just a touch of stage fright.
You know, his poems are even better than mine, huh?
All right, I'll just, uh, read the one that he was gonna read.
This one's called "Top of the World.
" "You don't know it, but sometimes I go to a hill "That overlooks the landscape's mask of city lights "For a sip of momentary grace "On this brink of everything I know "I can gain an eyeful of the lost Atlantis in the human soul "And a breath that fills my lungs with the air between two stars "If you were now to capture the image of this elation "In the framework of your mind "Or find transcendence through these words "Then, at most, you would know nothing "Of the beauty your existence throws to me "For mine is a love no experience "No measure, no words "Could ever degrade into reality by virtue of degree" I don't understand.
Come with me.
Shawn.
Okay How do I put this?
Who do you think you are?
Oh, that's a silly question, Shawn, I'm your best No, no, no, no, no.
No jokes.
No backpedaling.
Look into my eyes, Cory.
I am dead serious.
We have a problem here.
All right.
Shawn, I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
That's not what I want to hear.
Not this time.
I want to hear that you were wrong, that I asked you to back off, and you wouldn't take "no" for an answer, that you totally disregarded my feelings.
You went way too far this time, Cory.
All right, all right.
I did that.
Okay, but I Oh, oh, there better There better not be a "But.
" I did this for your own good.
You have no idea what my poetry is about, do you?
That poem that Feeny read in class, do you even know what that was about?
Nothing.
Cory, I can't say certain things, so I write them down.
That's how I get them out.
Now, I do that for me, not for anyone else.
I heard the poem, Shawn.
You heard it, but you didn't listen to it.
That poem you just read Do you even know who that was about?
Me.
It's about Angela.
I wrote that for her.
Well Angela, wait.
Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
Well, that's a first.
Listen, I'm sorry I read Shawn's poem.
And No.
I'm not sorry I read Shawn's poem.
I mean Don't you see that he would love to tell you how he feels?
Then he should tell me.
Angela, he's writing poems for you.
I mean, he obviously is still in love with you, and I know you still love him.
Remember?
You told me.
We were in the bathroom, and you were in a towel and we hugged.
I remember.
Maybe I do still have feelings for Shawn.
Okay, but that doesn't mean we should be together.
I'm finally okay.
I've started to move on.
Then what was the slap about?
How can he still have feelings for me and not want to be with me?
I don't know.
You know, he broke up with me.
He's the one that wanted to meet new people.
If he can't tell me how he feels about me, then what are we?
Well, it's not my nature to interfere, but I mean, I don't know.
Maybe his poetry is the only true way that he can tell you how he feels.
You know?
So meet him halfway.
Tell him how you feel.
Shawn Angela Go ahead.
You sure?
You're not gonna hit me again, are you?
I'm sorry I did that.
No, it's cool.
I probably deserved it.
You're probably right.
Look, I've been going over these words in my head over and over again 'cause I want to say this right.
Oh, just Just take your time.
We used to talk.
I mean, really talk.
I miss that.
I miss it, too.
Things just got weird.
I mean, I got weird.
But I don't want us to ever stop talking.
I couldn't stand that.
Oh, neither could I. And when I heard that poem Yeah, the poem.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I wrote that a long time ago.
You did?
Yeah, like way before we broke up.
So you don't have to feel weird.
And, you know Everything's okay.
Oh, well, great.
Because, um, it would've really been awkward knowing that you still had feelings for me.
You know, when I've clearly moved on.
Right.
So I guess we've both moved on.
Yeah.
We can just go forward as friends.
Good friends.
Hey, are we ever gonna see you two apart?
Not if we can help it.
Hey, everybody!
When's the next test, huh?
Hey, who cares?
Listen, man, I thought I'd be the last person to say this, but, uh, hey, thanks for letting us all know we just had to mellow out.
Hmm.
By the way, what's the success rate of this system of yours?
System?
What system?
The Eric Matthews foolproof study system.
Oh, dude!
Totally made that up.
You totally did what?
Oh, no, no, I know, I know.
Stop grumbling.
Now, I know you guys are all interested to see if this is gonna work, and you know what?
So am I. So are you?
You don't understand Okay, what has he done now?
He talked us into this idiotic study system of his.
Oh, interesting.
Hmm.
Ladies and gentlemen, your grades.
I can't see!
Audrey, you got an "A"!
So did I!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
Feeny!
Feeny!
Hang with me, hmm?
Well, I did nothing wrong.
Is it a crime to take off your left shoe and take your friend to the cinema?
Take off your left shoe?
Oh, not now, Feeny, come on.
No Just, you know, everybody was so uptight about the finals, I just, you know, tried to relax them a bit.
Oh, I see.
Congratulations.
I'm impressed with your insight.
A recent university study showed that nonstop focusing on one's studies hindered performance.
So it's a good idea to put down the books and clear one's mind.
Yeah.
After one has studied thoroughly and absorbed the material.
Yeah.
You forgot that part, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't do so good, did I?
Yeah.
D'oh!
I told you.
Hey.
They're not here yet.
You're kidding me!
We're gonna miss the movie.
I know.
So, uh, is everything okay with you and Angela?
Yeah, we talked it out.
I told her that I wrote the poem before we broke up, and everything's okay.
Good.
Hey, wait.
Shawn, is that the book you wrote the poem in?
Mmm-hmm.
Isn't that the book that I gave you for your birthday?
What's your point?
Well, my point is that you and Angela broke up before your birthday.
You couldn't have written that poem two months ago.
Shawn.
Okay.
Okay.
You got me.
I wrote it after we broke up.
How long after?
Not long after.
How long after?
I wrote it two weeks ago.
Oh, Shawn, you still do love Angela!
Okay, let's keep it down.
Let's keep it down.
I can't get her out of my mind, you know?
I miss her.
I miss how she made me feel.
I miss the fact that I could tell her things that no one else understands, not even Cory.
Well, then tell her that, Shawn.
I can't tell her that.
Why not?
Because I told her that I needed my space.
I told her that I wanted to meet new people.
I did this.
Well, if you two love each other, you should be together.
Maybe if Angela knew how you felt No, it's too late.
Angela's not in love with me anymore.
She told me she's over me and she just wants to be friends.
Hey!
Listen, are you okay with us all going out?
I mean, I hope I didn't mess everything up for you.
I'm okay.
You mean well.
You always mean well.
You know I didn't tell Shawn about how you feel, right?
I know.
I want you to promise me, promise me you're not gonna tell anyone, even Cory.
Okay.
I mean that.
Pinky swear.
I swear.
Hey, what do you swear?
I swear that I'm going to kill you if we miss this movie.
What took you guys so long?
Just tying up some loose ends.
Right, Cor?
Yeah.
Hey, we better get going if we don't wanna miss this movie.
Are we okay?
You're my date, aren't you?
My next poem is called "Frustration.
" Come on, Topanga!
I call this next poem "Feeny.
" Mr. Feeny is very smart On many subjects, including art And yet he can't help me with my frustration Come on, Topanga!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Pretty depressing, isn't it?
You talking to me?
Oh, actually, I was just talking to myself, but you look like you're in the same boat.
What boat?
What are you talking about?
I'm just sitting here at my table alone, trying to enjoy a cup of coffee.
Look at them.
Laughing, enjoying themselves, having a good time I hate them!
Who?
Them.
The popular.
I'm popular.
Hey, man, why don't you come and, you know, sit with me?
No.
Why don't you come sit with me?
Nah.
Then there it is, then.
Yeah, there it is.
Attention.
The Pennbrook Harvest Mixer is about to start on the second floor.
And remember, only those with invitations may attend.
Well, looks like it's just you and me, huh?
Now it's just you.
Good morning.
Say, is that one of those delicious cups of coffee from Brew Lagoon, conveniently located in the Pennbrook Student Union?
Why are you talking like that?
I'm not.
Rachel, why don't you scrape the garbage into the garbage disposal?
I'd just rather do it this way, okay?
Okay.
Have a good morning, and in case I don't see you, good evening, good afternoon, and good night!
Hey, what's all the excitement?
Oh, 11:00 man.
She's back from the gym, little sweaty, very sexy.
Drives me crazy, dude!
And then, the shower.
Yes!
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
Her, man!
The one in the background, man, behind the unpopular guy doing the puppet show.
Hey!
Oh, come on, get out of the way, cuckoo's nest!
You're blocking the goddess!
You sure that's three cheeses?
'Cause I only see two.
Where's the Gouda, pal?
That's right.
That's better.
There's a lot riding on these here eggs.
Hey, hey, I made Feeny a happy face waffle.
Huh?
The blueberries are the eyes.
Oh, this is so gonna work.
But I am concerned this is a tad morally wrong.
Oh, please.
Cory, all we're doing is treating the man who has been the driving force in our lives to a brunch.
And if he happens to go a little easier on us in class, so be it.
Okay.
Here you go, Mr. Feeny.
Ooh, a happy face waffle.
And a three-cheese omelet fit for the best educator in America.
That's one, two, and Gouda makes three.
I like Gouda.
I knew that.
But brunch really wasn't necessary.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's our way of saying thanks.
We're just glad we could sneak away from all our studies to do it.
Been burning the midnight oil, have you?
They are killing us, Feeny.
I mean, that Professor Williams is a sadist.
Well, there's always one tough class.
If only.
They're all ridiculous.
Scone?
Oh, no.
Please, I really have quite enough food.
Oh, are you kidding me?
Look at you.
You're ripped.
You're cut.
Jelly?
Boys, far be it from me to look a happy-faced waffle in its happy-faced little mouth, but what's the deal?
Deal?
Ouch.
Your words hurt like fists.
I mean, we really took you out as an appreciation of how much you've taught us thus far.
And we know that you've got a vested interest in us and want to see us do well.
Oh, I do, I do.
And we want you to know we'll try very hard in your class.
Even though we've got so much work in all our other classes.
I mean, they're killing us, Feeny.
It's like we can't breathe.
But we do not want any special treatment or consideration And we don't want you to think of this brunch as a bribe.
You want an extension on your midterm papers?
We'll give you Boys, we've known each other for years.
We have a long history together.
You don't have to go through all this.
If you need some help, just ask.
We just need a few days.
Four.
Three.
Two.
All right two.
Now that's how you make a deal.
More bubbly?
And that's how you eat soup.
If it's hot, I've found you can blow on it.
Let's try it.
Why?
How long have you been filming us?
It's not film.
It's live.
It's spontaneous.
It's unrehearsed.
Absolutely anything can happen.
Even this!
Told you they were gay.
Why would you do this?
You wanna know?
I was afraid, okay?
I'm afraid to just be another face in the college crowd.
I just want people to know me.
Maybe if they do, then they'd come over and they'd sit with me in the morning and just drink a cup of coffee.
You did this to have friends?
Yeah, that's right.
I did this to be popular.
How does he have a show and I don't?
Hey, what's all the yelling about?
There she is!
Congratulations.
You're on TV.
Who else is watching this?
There's a big crowd watching at the student union.
You know, it's almost worth the 23 hours of crap just to get to this.
No, man.
They're watching me.
They're watching her, not you.
Her.
Oh, why would they be watching her?
That's crazy.
She's not even dressed Oh, okay.
For next time, I'd like you to finish reading The Canterbury Tales, and be prepared to discuss Chaucer's intent, hmm?
Uh, not so fast.
I have your midterm papers.
Well, it's our first real big grades.
I'm kinda nervous.
Why, Angela?
You're an incredible student and you worked really hard.
You've nothing to be worried about.
Remember, boys, this is only one grade.
And there you are.
Okay, Cor, you ready?
Yeah.
This is it.
One, two, three I got a "B"!
Me, too!
Good, Cory.
Your parents will be very proud What is this?
It's a "B".
Hey, we got the same grade.
This is a travesty.
I got a "B-plus.
" Who cares?
How do I get the same grade as these two schlubs?
Feeny, thank you for the "B's.
" What did you get?
Don't thank me, boys.
You did the work.
And believe me, you are gonna be just as happy with the next one.
Are you aware that the next paper was due yesterday?
That's what we wanted to talk to you about because you remember how you said we could always come to you?
Well.
We're here.
How about three days?
No days.
Two days.
No days.
Shawn, perhaps I'm negotiating.
Let me see if I understand this.
You just decided that I would give you another extension?
Well, because of our long history together.
So you just didn't bother to do the papers at all?
They're killing us.
It's like we can't breathe.
I see.
Well, there's no need for you to turn in your papers at all, boys.
Sounds good.
I can give you your grades right now.
Well, even better.
You both get "F's.
" Hey.
That's not fair.
There's nothing more to discuss.
Feeny!
Uh-oh.
Oh, no.
Don't you run away from me, you old goat!
Oh, wow.
I thought he was our friend.
Yeah, I know.
He didn't even discuss it, did he?
I mean, he gave us an extension on the midterm.
What's the big deal with this one?
Yeah.
It's like he's two different people.
I thought we all had a special relationship with him.
Feeny, you change this!
Well, Since you're not set on a name for the baby, I myself have always been partial to George.
George?
Hmm.
George Matthews.
Well, we'll throw that into the hat.
George is a fine old name, of Germanic origin.
It means "Watch out, the sheep are coming.
" Watch-out-the-sheep- are-coming Matthews.
We'll think on that.
What's he doing here?
Hey, what's the problem?
Well, Why don't you ask him?
Him is Mr. Feeny to you.
That's all right, Amy.
It's just a matter between a teacher and his students.
I don't care what this is about, George.
Don't you ever use that tone of voice with this man.
This man stabbed us in the back.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Amy, this coffee is so good, I'm taking it with me.
This better be real good.
I don't even want to hear about it.
They were incredibly rude, and I'm going to punish them right now.
No, you can't punish us.
We're in college.
Oh, yeah?
How about I hit you so hard, you're back in high school?
Dad, it's really hard to be civil to Mr. Feeny after what he's done to us.
And what did he do to you?
He double-crossed us.
We came to him, as friends, and told him how swamped we were with our other classes.
And what does he do?
He says, "Oh, I understand.
" He says, "Oh, you can always come to me.
" And he lets us slide a little on our midterm.
Then he kills us on the next paper.
And what was your grade?
We didn't even turn it in!
Yeah!
He thinks that's an "F"!
Yeah.
We were gonna turn it in.
He didn't even let us explain.
Just gave us an "F".
Wait a minute.
Let me see if I'm understanding this.
Mr. Feeny was understanding enough to let you guys slide on a problem you had with your midterms.
Right.
So you assumed that was going to be the arrangement for the rest of your academic life?
Yeah.
Where's bad?
You know where's bad?
It's bad to think that Mr. Feeny couldn't even give you guys a break without you taking advantage of him.
You may be in college, pal, but you still have a lot of growing up to do.
Hey, you got a button on that thing that gets her naked?
Hey, hey, hey Hey!
Don't talk about my Rachel that way, all right?
I created her in my own image.
She's like my daughter.
Watch what I do to her now.
Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down!
Calm down!
It's the first time I've ever controlled another human being.
I'll get her back.
I'll get her back.
Look.
See?
See?
Where is she?
I'll get her.
Hang on!
Hang on!
I got her.
I got her.
Rachel?
Come into the living room, Rachel.
Come downstairs, Rachel.
Eric, is that you?
Where are you?
I'm over here.
Where?
In the student union.
What?
Nuts!
Um I'm in your mind.
I'm in the student union of your mind.
Oh, Eric, what are you doing?
Eric, why am I still on TV?
I thought you said you were gonna stop that.
Jack!
This isn't about me anymore, Rachel.
This is about you.
You're what the people want.
Yeah.
Tell her, Louie.
Rachel, it's me, Louie.
I love you.
Louie?
Tell me about yourself.
Is he still doing this?
Yes.
Where is he?
He's in the student union.
He's controlling everything.
Oh, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's a simple sound effect coming out of the stereo.
That's impressive.
Where have I seen this before?
Jack, let's get out of here.
Come on.
What?
What's the matter?
It's a brick wall!
Boy, he's really thought this one out.
Balcony.
What do you mean, the balcony?
It's three stories down.
We can't go out the balcony.
The only way out is through the window over the sink and down the fire escape.
The only way out is through the window over the sink, down the fire escape.
Oh, no.
We'll lose her before shower time.
She's not going anywhere.
Come on.
Watch this.
What?
What's the matter?
Come on, Rachel.
Tell him.
Bunny Baby.
What?
Bunny Baby, wanna play down the bunny hole?
This is where mommy puts all the carrots.
Let me put the light on so you can see.
All right.
It's okay.
Come here.
You heartless, unfeeling control freak.
It's no wonder you're not popular.
Yeah.
Quiet!
This is great TV.
This is human drama unfolding before you.
Rachel.
Come on.
It's the only way, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't do it, Jack.
I can't.
I will kill him.
Rachel, Rachel, come here.
You have to come through the window.
That's the only way.
What do you mean, over the sink?
Yes.
What have I done?
Oh, man.
What's the point of being popular when I just hurt the only two people who even tolerated me?
I am a monster.
Rachel.
Come on, Rachel.
You can do it.
You gotta go over, Rachel.
Confront your past, Rachel.
Conquer your fear!
Do it for Bunny Baby, Rachel.
Bunny Baby.
Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen, you have just witnessed a triumph of the human spirit, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who helped me with this.
First of all, I'd like to thank the boys in the audio-visual department.
I would like to thank the wonderful people at Milt's Masonry who built that lovely brick wall, and I would like to thank my roommate Jack, and, of course, the heroine or our saga Well, you got here incredibly fast.
Well, I was incredibly motivated.
Rachel, I am so proud of you.
Jeez, you're a freaking Amazon.
Get out of my way.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, wait a sec, wait a sec.
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel!
Before you do anything, I just want you to think about this.
I just want you to remember that It was I who created you.
It was I who gave you life.
This is really gonna hurt, isn't it?
You heard me.
Where's the Gouda, pal?
Now, was that so hard?
Shawn, Shawn!
I got Feeny A sorry-faced waffle.
Oh, nice touch.
Here you go, Mr. Feeny.
Why is my waffle so sad?
Because we are.
Sad that we ever took advantage of our friendship.
Sad that we let you down.
Sad that the whole thing blew up in our faces.
I'm sad, but I'm honest.
Boys, you've already apologized.
I mean, this isn't necessary.
Mmm!
Love that Gouda.
Oh, but it is necessary.
And we have something else for you.
Remember that paper we never turned in?
Yes?
Well, we stayed up all night, and we did it anyway.
Just because we thought it was the right thing to do.
And because we want to earn our grades on the strengths of our efforts and not on the strengths of our friendship.
Well, I am deeply, deeply touched.
"F".
"F".
What would a "D-minus" get me?
You know, I gotta tell you, that little stunt you pulled, really backfired.
What are you talking about?
I'm the most popular dude on campus.
Not with Rachel.
While you were busy terrorizing her, Rachel and I got much closer, if you catch my drift.
You ingrate.
I put you on TV, and that's how you repay me?
Huh?
By stealing my girl?
How do you live with yourself?
I don't.
I live with you.
Yeah, I'm thinking Rachel and I might take our relationship to that next level.
Thank you, Eric.
Oh, could you guys disappear?
I'd like to be left alone with my date.
Date?
Yeah.
I found a guy who's absolutely crazy about me.
Hey, losers.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
What's with the shrub?
Well, you know, one of my favorite duties as high school principal was overseeing the holiday decorations.
So, I decided to carry on the tradition here.
Oh, it's a precious little tree.
Look at it.
Look.
Oh.
Hey!
What are you doing?
University policy.
Happy nondenominational holidays.
Well, I suppose you two are heading home for the holidays.
No.
No, actually, no.
I was supposed to meet my parents in the Bahamas, but somehow the airlines messed up my ticket, so now I'm stuck here.
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas!
Ho ho ho It's me.
It's Eric.
Hello, Mr. Matthews.
I'm glad to see you've got the holiday spirit.
What I got is 12 bucks an hour, a 15% discount at Stuckey's department store, and a job where I get to sit on my butt all day.
It's kind of like your job.
$12 an hour?
I wish.
Okay, come over here, guys.
Uh-oh.
Gifts all around.
Signed you guys up, too.
Mrs. Claus.
Elf boy.
Eric, well, thank you for thinking of me.
I was all set to spend Christmas depressed over my ex-boyfriend.
Now I get to be Mrs. Claus.
I'm not going to be an elf.
I was depressed enough about not going to the Bahamas.
This little green pointy hat's really going to push me over the edge.
Oh, come on, Jack.
Look, we're stuck here in town alone.
Look, we'll be working together.
It'll be fun.
Oh, look how cute you are.
Yeah, plus you're going to be making, like, 5 bucks an hour.
Wait a second.
You get Hey.
I'm Santa.
You're just an elf.
Read your Bible.
Come on.
Look, Shawn, the dorms are closing, your father's missing again, why wouldn't you come to my house for Christmas?
Because I hate being the third wheel.
Oh, please.
You know, you've been the third wheel with me and Topanga so long, I think of us as a tricycle.
You know, without our third wheel, what would we be?
A bicycle?
You coming or not?
I'll get my bags.
Thanks, Cory.
Merry Christmas, Shawn.
Hey!
Merry Christmas.
Hey.
Hey.
Merry Christmas.
Thanks.
Maybe you should ask Cory if it's okay for me to hang out with you guys this Christmas.
Angela, now that Cory and I are engaged, Cory's family is my family.
Besides, your dad is stationed halfway around the world.
Do you really want to spend Christmas alone?
I'll get my bags.
Thanks, Topanga.
Oh, Topanga.
Uh, listen, there's a slight change in our first-ever engaged Christmas plans.
See, Shawn's bunking in my room, so the sex is off.
You invited Shawn?
Wait a minute.
Why?
I invited Angela.
You invited Angela?
Who said you could invite Angela?
She's gonna kill me!
Oh, my God.
Shawn's gonna blame me for this.
Hey, why would Angela want to kill you?
Hey, why would Shawn blame you?
You know something about Angela.
You know something about Shawn.
All right.
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Angela's still in love with Shawn.
I hate that.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Listen, she swore me to secrecy.
You got to tell me what you know about Shawn.
Shawn is still in love with Angela.
Yay.
He wrote that poem for her after they broke up.
Oh, yay.
The only reason he said he was over her was because he thought she was over him.
Aren't you going to say yay?
No.
I don't like to be predictable.
We can't ever tell them we know.
We'll betray our friendships.
Okay, here's the plan.
We tell them.
Cory, no plans.
Please tell me we'll let them do this on their own.
What kind of cockamamie is that?
Listen, it's Christmas, they love each other, they're staying at my house.
I mean, this thing is out of our hands.
So, you won't interfere?
It's way too early to tell.
Hey!
We're home for the holidays.
Hope no one minds a few extra people.
I'll get some sleeping bags.
Hey, sorry I took so long, I Shawn, I didn't know you were coming.
Well Topanga didn't tell me she invited Angela, and I didn't tell you I invited Shawn.
Ha!
Nutty.
Cory, I'm going to kill you.
Listen, this is an innocent mix-up.
I I promise.
But don't leave now, or Shawn will think it's because of him.
I can't believe you did this to me.
I didn't know.
What do you want me to do, say she can't stay here because you're secretly in love with her?
Hey, you know what?
We're all friends here, right?
Friends who secretly love the holidays, and on the holidays, all that matters is that we're together, no matter how we really feel about each other.
Why do you always have to hit?
Die, die, die, dead!
Die, dead.
Die, dead!
What are you playing, Santa?
Suzy Shops-A-Lot.
You're a freak.
Hey, at least my shoes don't point up.
Look, if I wanted to hear people fight for Christmas, I would've spent it with my ex-boyfriend.
Ho ho ho Hold up.
Hold up.
Hold up.
Hold up one second.
I'm almost on level two.
Die, die, die, die.
Die, dead.
Die, dead!
Why don't you put the game down, Santa?
Yes, there's a sweet little boy that wants to sit on your lap.
Ho ho ho.
Come up here, little one.
Okay, well, what do you want?
I just want my picture taken so I can send it to my grandma so she sends me a check.
Hmm.
After she sends the check, tell her she forgot the check.
Works every time.
Santa!
Ho ho.
All right.
Hey, can we get a picture here?
Well, hello, Mrs. Claus.
Okay.
That little kid just pinched me.
Uh, Santa, Mrs. C., elf boy Yeah, I just got word that a busload of children from Saint Mary's just arrived.
Now, these are children without parents and no money at all, so You know what that means.
Yeah.
That they're not going to buy anything, so get rid of them as fast as you can.
Oh, here comes the little darlings now.
Hello, you little darlings.
Wow.
No parents.
That's really tough.
You know what?
We should give them a little attention.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh, come and sit on Santa's lap.
And what's your name, little one?
Lucy.
Lucy.
And what do you want for Christmas, Lucy?
I don't know.
Oh, come on, Lucy.
That's Santa.
Thanks, Jack.
Is that Suzy Shops-A-Lot?
Oh, well, it certainly is.
Why Why don't you ask Santa for one of those?
Well, I never got anything I asked Santa for.
Oh, I don't think you were asking the right Santa.
Wow, you really are Santa!
Oh.
Smile.
There you go, Lucy.
Thank you.
Did you hear that?
I really am Santa.
I know.
That's so cool.
Oh, you should've seen your faces in that picture.
They were priceless.
She really believed in us.
Oh, man, you know something?
I love being Santa.
You know, it's not just, you know, putting on the suit and getting the superpowers and everything.
I mean, it's a I made her happy.
Look at that.
I did that.
I know.
Well, you look pretty happy, too, there, Santa Claus.
Elf boy, here's Santa's dad's credit card.
I want you to go and take it and buy toys for all these kids.
You know what?
I want to help out, too.
I'm going to use the money I was going to spend on the Bahamas trip.
Hmm.
I'll help you shop.
Oh, I don't have any money, so Okay, yeah.
Let's go.
Okay, who's next?
Time's a wastin'.
Okay, Karen, let's see what Santa's got for you.
Santa for you has This bag.
Ooh.
Okay.
Smile.
Okay.
Bye-bye, Karen.
Bye-bye.
Oh.
She was grateful for a bag.
She was grateful for a bag.
I know.
We did really good, Santa.
You make me proud to be Mrs. Claus.
You know, spending my money for those presents was better than any trip I could've taken.
I'm really proud to be your elf.
Well, you know something?
You guys get ready to be proud tomorrow, because we are just starting here.
I will not rest until every needy kid gets what they ask for.
Uh-oh.
Eric, nobody expects you to take care of all the needy children.
Then why were they sent to me?
Oh, boy.
Eric, we're out of money.
Yeah.
See, we've done all that we can do.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Santa will not accept that, elf.
Okay.
Look, I'm telling you.
We're out of toys, you know?
We just got to get a little creative.
Wait a minute.
How do you suppose that we get creative?
Oh, you shouldn't have asked him that.
Oh, wow.
Mr. Feeny, that's a lot of fruitcake.
Yeah, I wasn't able to hand out gifts to my new colleagues.
Oh, yeah, I'll take those off your hands.
Here.
Throw them in here, man.
Apparently the tradition at Pennbrook is to beat it out of town as fast as humanly possible.
That's it?
That's all you got?
Just the fruitcake?
Yes.
Well, at least there is one tradition that is sacred.
I shall now hang up my traditional wise Santa ornament.
But Ooh.
Jeez.
I'm sorry, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, well, not to worry.
I'll simply find a substitute.
Like this shiny red ball.
How special.
All aboard for Santa Land.
Eric, it's Christmas eve.
Hey, we were going to spend this together as a family.
I'm Santa.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, my gosh, what are you doing?
I never see them.
Hey, kids.
How was ice skating?
Yuletides of fun, Mom.
But who knew it would be couples only?
I didn't, I swear.
Cory?
Will you please stay out of this?
When you and I broke up, Shawn did everything in his power to get us back together.
Now it's Christmas.
Can you think of a better gift than doing the same thing for them?
I know your intentions are good.
Just don't push so hard.
Okay.
I'll be more subtle.
All right.
Who wants to string some popcorn?
Shawn and Angela!
Hey, Cory, I always string Here you go.
Please?
So, you and me.
Stringing popcorn.
Go for it.
No, you go ahead.
Okay.
Angela, I'm not sorry that we're spending Christmas together.
I'm not either.
All right, everybody.
Tree is ready.
Gather around, and I'll light the Christmas lights.
Oh, uh, Shawn and Angela, the tree looks so much better from right up here.
Right up on that step.
Oh.
What's that?
Mistletoe?
Could he be any more obvious?
Yeah, like the ice skating and caroling weren't bad enough.
What's he think, a little holiday spirit and we're just going to fall into each other's arms?
Oh.
It's beautiful.
I love Christmas.
What?
You kissed Angela.
Cory, don't make a big deal out of this.
Shawnie, it is a big deal.
No, not this time.
She's over me and we are over each other.
Why won't you let this go?
Because Angela's still in love with you.
She didn't want to break up with you in the first place, and I know you wrote that poem because you still love her.
What?
How do you know that?
Someone told me.
I mean, no one told me.
I mean I didn't say anything.
Please don't take me to Topanga.
Okay.
I want to know what's going on.
Topanga, what did you tell him?
Cory.
Angela, I told Shawn that you still love him, and I know Topanga was telling you that Shawn still loves you What?
You didn't tell her anything, did you?
No.
No, I didn't.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I'm thinking now's a good time.
Somebody better start talking, and I think it should be you and me.
Let's get out of here.
Guys, wait.
I couldn't see their faces.
Did they look angry?
Ooh, yes, like that.
Has anyone seen my toaster oven?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The Easy-Bake Oven is for rookies.
Wouldn't you rather Santa gave you your very own toaster oven?
All right.
Here we go.
Okay.
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
Look how happy she is about the toaster oven.
I am telling you something, Christmas is the greatest idea anybody ever had.
Well, looks like I'm all out of stuff here.
Made all these little kids happy.
Yeah.
You're a great Santa.
Hey, and you're a great elf, and I am a great Santa.
You know something?
I want the world's happiness to be my responsibility.
What a great job.
Oh, excuse me, Santa Claus.
Mmm.
Yes, Mrs. Claus?
I think the little boy needs to speak with you.
Oh, oh, of course.
That's what Santa's here for.
Come on up, little one.
Oh, come up here, my little Hey, you look familiar.
Are you in my psych class?
I was here yesterday.
My name's Tommy.
Yeah, Santa, he came with the other children on the bus.
Oh Oh, Tommy!
Of course, of course.
I remember you.
I gave you the truck.
Yeah, and I came to give it back.
Well, why?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing.
It's what I wanted.
Well, then what's the problem?
I didn't really believe you were Santa, but all my friends came back with stuff.
So, now that I know you're really him, I was wondering if I can give this back and ask for something else instead.
Of course you can, Tommy.
Anything you want.
Really?
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
What do you need, Tommy?
What can I do for you?
Do you think I can have parents for Christmas?
I thought just about everybody would be out celebrating by now.
Oh, well.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
So, why can't we just tell each other how we feel?
I don't know.
It's confusing, huh?
Yeah.
We broke up.
We agreed to move on.
Next thing you know, we're kissing under the mistletoe.
Yeah, and letting Cory tell us how we should feel.
When we're not even sure ourselves.
Oh, no, Shawn.
I'm sure.
I love you.
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to be sure about what you felt.
Well, when we broke up, I thought I wanted to be free, but I couldn't stop thinking about you.
That scares me.
I don't know what to do with those feelings.
You give in to them, Shawn.
Because then you'd be in love with someone who loves you, too.
Isn't that what you want?
You are a wonderful person, Angela.
Isn't that what you want, Shawn?
I I don't know what I want.
I'm so confused, okay?
I don't think I really don't think I'm ready.
I opened my heart to you.
I just can't sit around like a fool, waiting for you to be ready.
Angela I'm done.
It's over, Shawn.
I want to make the happiness of the entire world my responsibility.
What an idiot.
What am I supposed to do?
I made all those little kids smile, took care of everybody that came to see me.
No disrespect, but why would you send me that little boy?
Why doesn't that nice little boy have parents?
Why doesn't that nice little boy have parents?
Why did you send me that little kid?
And why do I only come to you when I need something?
You shouldn't have to take care of everything, right?
I will take care of this.
I can be responsible for the happiness of one little boy.
What could be taking them so long?
I love you.
You love me.
We're back together.
Let's thank Cory and Topanga.
I mean, that's Guys, do we have to wait for Eric to open our presents?
No, honey.
You've been patient long enough.
How about each one of us open one?
Okay.
Hey, mine's empty.
"Your 75-bit power drill was donated "to a child in need.
Love, Santa Claus.
" He also gave away my breast pump.
Ooh.
This is for you.
I don't understand.
I do.
Where's Eric?
He, uh I, um Oh, the kids were just so cute, you know.
It wasn't just him, we all Yeah, yeah.
See, here's the thing.
Have you ever really gotten caught up in the spirit of Christmas, so much so that you want to steal?
Merry Christmas, everybody.
How you doing?
This is It's okay.
Come on in.
This is Tommy.
Hi.
Well, hi, Tommy.
Do you have my 75-bit power drill?
Eric, what's going on?
Well, you see, Tommy here doesn't have a family, so I thought it'd be nice if he could spend Christmas with us.
You know, if it's okay with everybody else.
Sure.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah.
Hey, Tommy, do you like gingerbread cookies?
Yeah.
So do I. Yep, Tommy and I met when I was Santa.
He thought I was really Santa.
Now I know he's Eric.
Yeah.
He said we could still hang out, though.
Eric said we can hang out on weekends.
Yeah, it'll be like he's got a big brother.
Well, he's a good one, Tommy.
Figured it was something I could do.
Merry Christmas, Eric.
Merry Christmas, Tommy.
Merry Christmas.

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Previously on Boy Meets World Angela and I decided to take a break.
You broke up?
Yeah.
I guess that's what we did.
I didn't break up with Shawn.
What do you mean?
He broke up with me.
If you two love each other, you should be together.
Maybe if Angela knew how you felt No, it's too late.
Angela's not in love with me anymore.
I opened my heart to you.
I just can't sit around like a fool, waiting for you to be ready.
Angela It's over, Shawn.
Wow!
These women are fat.
Eric.
Hey, look.
Thanks again for filling in on such short notice.
I have no idea where your father is.
Oh, don't worry about it, Mom.
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for little Eric, or if it's a girl, Eric the girl.
Don't touch my stomach.
Hi.
Okay, mommies and daddies.
Let's take our seats and get comfortable.
How you doing?
Good.
Hi.
That's my mom.
I'm her baby.
Eric, the pillows are for me.
You.
Oh, you, you, you.
It's all about you, isn't it?
Now, giving your partner lots of support, let's start with deep diaphragmatic breathing.
So, where's your daddy?
I mean, your tummy's daddy.
You know, the guy that did that to you.
My husband's in the Navy.
He's on an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea.
Oh, yeah, I'm filling in for my dad.
He ran out on my mom this morning.
Eric!
Hello.
I'm his mother, and yet I'm having another one.
It's nice for you to fill in for your dad.
Hi.
I'm Jessica.
Oh, hi.
I'm Eric.
How are you?
Oh, look at that.
You wobble like a Weeble.
Amy, I completely forgot.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
I just lost track of time.
It's really okay, Dad.
Don't worry about it.
I got the whole thing under control.
All right, ready, Mom?
Push!
Goodbye, Eric.
Okay.
All right.
Let's move on to some controlled breathing exercises.
Hey, Eric, if you're free, I'd really appreciate it if you'd be my partner.
Really?
Oh, that's so nice that somebody appreciates me.
Okay, coaches.
Count three "hee, hee, hee" breaths, followed by three "ho, ho, ho" breaths.
What was so important that made you late?
I was looking at something.
Alan, you're being a little vague.
Motorcycle.
What?
A motorcycle?
Right on, Dad!
We're having a baby, and you're out looking for motorcycles?
Why don't you just go all the way and buy yourself a yellow corvette?
You'd be okay with that?
If it would get you to class on time.
Alan, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm just a little late, that's all.
I've done this three times.
I'm not like one of these kids who has no idea what's going on.
Old man's getting a yellow corvette, huh?
Right on, brother.
Hello, guys.
Thanks for coming.
We know why we're here.
You don't have to say anything.
Cory and I discussed it.
We've decided that we are not going to butt into your lives no matter what you do.
Right, Cory?
Absolutely.
You're our best friends, but we have no right to tell you to be together if that's not what you want.
We don't believe you.
You don't believe me?
No, no, no.
Him.
We don't believe him.
Which is why we've drawn up a little document.
This is a restraining order.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
"Cory Matthews and Topanga Lawrence "are hereby forbidden to interfere with the separation of "or encourage accidental rendezvous between Shawn and Angela.
"In addition, the aforementioned parties are " Aforementioned parties?
Is this what we are to you?
I, for one, do not need a piece of paper to know when to butt out.
And I do?
All right, I do.
Look, we love you both, and we appreciate everything you've tried to do, but, you know, this is the best for all of us.
See you later.
Wait a minute.
Shawn, are you all right with this?
Yes.
Yes, I am fine.
In fact, both Angela and I have dates tonight.
Shawn Hunter has been out of circulation for far too long.
I am back.
I am excited, and I'm ready to rock and roll.
All right.
Where you gonna take her?
I don't know.
Who cares?
I want to thank you guys for bringing us here.
I'm having a really good time.
Yeah, me, too.
You know, I was a little worried about going out with Shawn at first because I heard he just ended a long relationship, and I thought he'd be a drag.
He's not normally like this.
Shawn's a ton of fun.
Talk to him.
Hey, hey.
What's the matter, buddy?
I'm a little blue.
It doesn't show, does it?
No!
No, you are the life of the party, friend.
Everybody is thrilled to be with you.
Is it me?
It can't be me.
I'm adorable.
You are.
You're as cute as could be.
He must have really loved this girl.
I can't discuss it.
I'm under a restraining order.
Hey.
Hey.
Get up.
You used to be so good at this.
You were the king.
He was the king!
Shawn, would it make you feel any better if I told you that Angela's in the same place you are?
Maybe a little.
Then cheer up.
Angela's in the same place you are.
So, I says, "Feeny, if the sun never sets on the British Empire, "when do they watch Letterman"?
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.
Angela!
Of all the restaurants in Philadelphia, you chose this one.
Well, what a coincidence.
This is Ron.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Ron, how are you?
I'm Shawn.
Good to meet you.
This is Kelly, my date.
That's Topanga and Cory, and this is Kelly, my date.
I understand we have a potentially embarrassing situation here, but I hope we can all be mature and have a wonderful time.
Angela, it's always good to see you.
Ron seems like a great guy.
Enjoy yourselves.
Have a good night.
This is Kelly, my date.
You, too, Shawn.
Nice meeting you, Kelly.
You see?
Do you see how much fun Shawn can be?
Yeah, that's the Shawn I heard about.
What a crazy world, huh?
But don't you worry.
You handled that like a prince.
You know why?
Because you are the king of dating, and we are all No, we are all gonna have a good time, Shawnie.
No, no.
We're gonna have a good time.
Long night.
Long.
Hey, check this out.
It says here the uterus has accordion-like folds that can expand to accommodate a baby up to 22 pounds.
Man, women are so lucky.
Eric, I'm eating.
It also says here that when a woman breaks her water, she's actually lost her mucus plug.
I'm done.
Procreation, man.
Who knew?
Come!
Hey!
There he is, the man himself.
Hey, Daddy-o.
How cool is it that you and Mom get to go through this again?
This baby stuff is so great.
Eric, look, I want your opinion on something.
Look at this, will you?
What do you got here, Dad, huh?
Cribs, diapers, car seats?
You got motorcycles.
That's great, Dad.
I'm trying to bring a new life into the world, and you're picking out a hog.
Yeah, yeah.
Check out this wide glide, here, huh?
I'm gonna chrome that baby up, huh?
Put on some Vance & Hines pipes, a Mikuni carb, and hit the highway to hell.
How old are you?
Forty-one Forty-three.
Don't you see what you're going through?
This is your Middle East crisis.
Middle age crisis.
I'm not going through anything.
I just want a Harley.
My dad went through the same thing.
Mmm-hmm, me, too.
He got hair transplants and tried out for The Real World.
I'm not going through anything.
That's exactly what he said right before he smashed up his Ferrari.
Your fathers are silly.
Hey, do I or do I not get ape hangers, huh?
Dad Dad Dad Dad, okay, hey!
Pull the bike over, pull the bike over.
Dad, can I give you some tough love?
I think you're crazy.
You know what?
I think we're all pretty sure about what's going on here.
And you know what?
It's okay.
Yeah, you're not alone.
It's perfectly natural.
You know something, Dad?
He's right.
Because, see, with every day, with every breath, you're one step closer to death.
And you're thinking to yourself, "I haven't lived.
" And you know something Are you trying to cheer me up here?
Mr. Matthews, you don't need a motorcycle to make you feel younger.
You're gonna have a baby.
What could make you feel younger than that?
Yeah, for the next 18 years, that little tiger's gonna keep you running day and night.
You know something, Dad?
He's absolutely right.
You're not gonna have time for motorcycles and fast cars and nose rings.
You've got this new little life coming into the world that's gonna be counting on you.
Grow up!
Grow up?
I am grown up.
I'm so grown up I don't know if I can do this again.
Oh, of course you can.
You did a good job two times before.
That's three.
I said what I said.
Well, things are different now.
Why?
I'm different.
I'm older.
When you were born, I really looked forward to running around with you, playing baseball and football, and I really looked forward to being more than a father to you.
I looked forward to being your friend, which I think I am.
Of course you are, Dad.
You are my friend, man.
What am I gonna be to this new kid?
I'm just gonna be his old man.
That's all I'm gonna be to him.
Just his old man.
You've gotta stop looking at Angela.
I think she's having a good time.
She's just trying to move on with her life.
So should you.
You know what would be fun?
They're starting the karaoke contest.
Do you wanna sing?
Kelly, I appreciate the offer, but I have a no karaoke policy.
And now let's give a warm Captain Randy's coco-loco welcome to our first contestants, Angela and Ron!
Okay, let's pick out a song.

Topanga, you heard Angela and Ron.
If we wanna win this, we must sing something dramatic.
I know.
I just don't think this is the right song for us.
You wanna win or not?
Yes, I wanna win.
I just don't think that you and I are the right people to express this particular sentiment.
Topanga, it's a beautiful song, and we're gonna sing it.
Hit it, Captain Randy.
War!
Huh.
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing.
Say it again.
War!
Good God, you all.
This is all a big joke to you, right, Topanga?
They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well, I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you've got me, and, baby, I've got you Babe I got you, babe I got you, babe They say our love won't pay the rent Before it's earned, our money's all been spent I guess that's so, we don't have a pot But at least I'm sure of all the things we've got Babe I got you, babe I got you I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
That's okay, Shawn.
Maybe we'll try again another time.
Yeah.
Okay, mommies and daddies.
Everyone should each have a baby.
Now, the first thing we're going to focus on is learning how to burp your newborn.
Now, sit the baby on your knee, and with one hand supporting the chest, gently pat the baby on the back with the other hand.
Miss, mine broke.
Could you give me that head?
I know how to burp a baby.
What are we doing here?
Now, you can also try the shoulder method.
Supporting the baby's head, lift the baby up to your shoulder.
Oh, my God!
What?
I think my water broke.
Miss, mine broke!
What?
My partner.
Her water just broke.
This is real!
What do we do?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm filling in for my sister.
All I know are burping, diapers, and hee, hee, hee, ho, ho, ho!
Okay.
Who knows what to do?
Eric, Eric, go get the car.
Bring it around to the front of the building.
Amy, you just ride in the back with Jessica.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Listen, somebody call St. Vincent's.
Just tell 'em we'll be there in about five minutes, all right?
All right, thank you.
Shawn, first dates after a break-up are always difficult.
It'll get easier.
No, it won't.
Let's face it, there's something wrong with me.
No, there's nothing wrong with you, Shawn.
It's just I mean, you're obviously hurting over Angela, and it's gonna take time.
When you're ready to meet somebody new, you will.
I don't wanna meet somebody new.
I'd screw that up, too.
Guys, it's me.
Look, I already had something great, and I killed it.
I'm never gonna have a relationship like you guys.
I'm not normal.
Well, Shawn, we're not normal.
I mean, we're freaks.
We are.
We're freaks who've loved each other since we were two.
I know.
And being friends with you guys has shown me how great it is to have a relationship.
But I don't know how to do that.
I mean, what if I'm incapable of loving somebody?
What if I can't do that?
Shawn, that's crazy.
No, it's not.
Not for me.
I don't know.
It's just It's kind of hard being around you two, you know?
Shawn, what do you want us to do?
Nothing, nothing.
It's not you, it's me.
Cory, for the first time, I've realized how different we really are.
I just need time.
I gotta be alone.
I am alone.
Hey!
Hey, we got your message.
Yeah, is everything okay?
Oh, everything is more than okay.
She's the mother of a beautiful baby girl.
And she's got this man right here to thank for it.
Eric.
I'm serious, Dad.
You knew just what to do.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
I mean, she was in trouble.
No, I'm not talking about with her.
I'm talking about with me, man.
I was petrified.
You saw me.
I froze there, man, but I'm telling you, you knew what to do, like always.
You're gonna do that for the new baby, too.
Yeah, the very lucky new baby to have a great dad like you.
I hope so.
So, you still getting the Harley?
'Cause I was thinking about borrowing it.
Sorry, Jack.
You can borrow my station wagon.
That's great.
The women are really gonna love that.
So, this mid-life crisis is all about the baby, right?
There's never been any question about how much I want the baby, Amy.
I'm just worried about how much the baby's gonna want me.
I'm afraid I'm gonna be too tired to play catch or teach him how to ride a bike.
I'm worried I'm not gonna have enough energy to run around with him the way we did with the other kids.
You think that's what makes you a good father?
I mean, yeah, sure, you taught me how to swing a bat, but any Little League coach could do that.
It was more important that you were there for me after I struck out.
You made me feel better.
You were always there for me, man, just to listen to me, to give me advice, you know, and to help me get through stuff, just like you did today.
You're never gonna be too old to do that.
Well, I know I'm never gonna be too old to give my son a hug.
No, you really are.
No Hey, everyone, I propose a toast.
A toast to new babies everywhere.
To new babies everywhere.
And the older ones.
All I'm saying is, you guys should have been there.
It was a miracle.
Ah, man.
I want to have at least five kids.
Five?
I want, like, one, maybe two.
You know, I want five.
So do I. Well, Topanga tells me that she wants to have kids as soon as she gets married.
Wait a minute.
It takes nine months to have a baby.
We're getting married in nine months.
I better go brush my teeth.
Oh War!
Huh!
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again War!
Huh!
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again War!
Huh!
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again Sing it, Topanga, sing it!
I don't like the war War's not good No war!
No more war, Topanga I'll tell you why I'm gonna cry We don't like war Not you or you or you Or I Or I I've gotta run 'Cause I don't like war
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, let's get some coffee before class, okay?
Oh, what's the point of even going to class?
Because otherwise we have to go to war.
I am at war, Cory.
I'm at war with myself.
Why am I like I am?
Shawn, listen, you just gotta relax, okay?
Hey, guys, buy you coffee?
What are you trying to say?
What I'm trying to say is, hey, guys, buy you coffee?
I can afford my own coffee.
Yeah, I know you can, Shawn.
I was just offering.
I would take a latte.
Hey, isn't this great, the three of us having coffee, just us guys?
We never get to do that.
Why do we never get to do that?
Cory?
See ya.
Shawn.
We got a nasty situation over at the pool table.
Old dude has been running the table like he built it.
Beat my butt for 50 bucks.
Whoa.
And you're the best stick around.
Well, next to me, that is.
So, you think you can take him?
I don't know.
I never have before.
You know the dude?
Kind of.
He's my father.
I win again!
Come on, double or nothing?
I'll let you break.
So, is this what you're doing for kicks now?
Hustling students out of their tuition money?
I'm not hustling, I'm teaching!
I'm teaching them not to play pool with a stranger, especially when that stranger's me.
Come on, boys, give your daddy a big hug!
How you doing?
Good.
Hey.
Hey.
So, what are you doing here, Dad?
Oh, wait, wait.
Let me guess.
Passing through on your way to somewhere else.
No, no.
No, you see, that's where you're wrong.
I have arrived at the spot where I'm gonna stay put.
See, I took a look at my life.
I said, "Chet.
" And I went, "What"?
I said, you know, you got a couple boys you ought to spend some time with.
You got fired, didn't you?
Don't nitpick.
The point is I'm here and I'm staying.
Just as sure as I'm winning this next game.
Oh, well, we'll have to see about that one.
Yes!
Whoo!
Ah!
Here's your money back, guys.
They're like piranhas.
Hey, that was some fine shooting, Shawn.
Well, I learned everything I know from you.
Yeah, and don't you forget it, either.
From now on, there'll be lots and lots of time for us playing pool.
So you're really staying for good?
That's the plan, Son.
Man, I am so proud to have two boys in college!
You know what?
I'm gonna go get me one of them official Pennbrook University sweatshirts.
You know, ever since I've been here, he's been on the road.
I guess I just can't believe I'm gonna actually get to spend time with my father.
You're not.
He said he's staying.
Yeah, but the man doesn't know how to stay.
Trust me, he'll be gone before your next class starts.
All right.
Now, I want the official college tour, starting with that laboratory where they torture the mice.
Then, tonight, we'll have dinner at Steak 'n' Suds.
On me, of course.
Boys, we're gonna be a family!
To the mice!
That is, without a doubt, the best meal I have ever had.
God, I love beef!
I really wish you hadn't picked up the check, Jack.
Aw, hey, it's no big deal.
No, it is a big deal.
He said it was on him.
Why you gotta be such a show-off?
He'll get it next time.
How about it, Dad?
Every Thursday night, Steak 'n' Suds night?
I'm there!
Don't hold your breath.
Hi, guys.
Look what somebody left in your house.
I've been to three county fairs, two pigstickings and a goat rope, but I ain't never seen nothing like you.
Dad, this is my roommate Rachel.
Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you, Mr. Hunter.
Did they tell you that my wife passed on and I'm starting to date again?
I'm just kidding.
I love the dear woman, wherever the hell she is.
Oh, how about I get a picture of father and sons for my scrapbook?
Hey, whatever your pretty little red head desires.
What is she, 6'7"?
Man, she could eat a pie off your head.
Okay, everybody.
Get together.
Come on.
Oh, smile, Shawn.
It's your dad.
Yay!
Hey.
Let me get one of my son Jack with my future daughter-in-law.
Hey!
Hey, Errol.
Hug her tight, Son.
Oh!
That was nice.
How you doing, Chet?
When are you leaving?
He's not.
He's staying.
Oh, Jack, that's great.
This means you're gonna get to spend time Hold on, hold on.
Can I just clear something up?
The man is not staying.
He never has.
He never will.
You know, you been busting my chops since I got here.
What is your problem?
I don't have any problems, Dad.
What would make you think I have any problems?
Hey, how about cake?
I'm not hungry.
Oh, come on.
It's my famous homemade double fudge whipped cream cake.
It's delicious.
I'd love some.
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
That is dee-dang-licious.
Yeah, yeah.
He's right here.
It's for you.
Hello.
Hey, Tommy!
Uh-huh.
Well, how much are they paying?
Um Let me get back to you on that, Tommy, okay?
But thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bye.
So, when you leaving?
You know, that shows you how much you know.
I just got offered the best job I ever had dealing blackjack in Vegas.
But you didn't hear me say I was gonna take it, did you?
I didn't hear you turn it down.
I'm gonna turn it down.
I'm just Keeping my options open.
That is so like you.
You always do this, over and over and over again.
You come into town, you make all these promises, and just when I think we're actually gonna get close, you take off again.
Oh, my God.
I'm you.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact that I can't keep a relationship, I drive all my friends away, I hurt everybody I care about.
Hey, Shawn, come on, take it easy.
No.
This doesn't concern you.
He's my father, too, okay?
I'm gonna have some cake.
Yeah.
Oh, here.
Okay, okay!
All right, I'll call Tommy, I'll tell him I'm not taking the damn job.
You happy?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
What's going on?
Dad?
Dad?
My hand's about to fall off from all that paperwork they had me filling out.
He's in there with a heart attack, and you're out here complaining about forms?
They weren't gonna treat him until somebody filled out the paperwork.
You've really been out of it since the ambulance ride.
Yeah, well, maybe you're not going through what I am.
I don't want to talk about this right now, okay?
Let's just go see our father.
I thought it would be nice if he had his own room.
Yeah, well, whatever this nice room costs, I'm paying half.
Oh, look, don't worry about it, man.
My stepfather's willing to help out.
You know, it's My dad and I do not need charity from your family.
Shawn, you don't need No.
How much does this room cost?
How much does the room cost?
$2,000.
Oh.
Okay.
A day.
What, are they out of their freaking minds?
Well, here's 20 to start.
Oh, come on.
Take it.
"For ours is a love unlike any "there has ever been "or ever will be again.
"What I feel for you transcends love itself "as two souls become one "on this, our wedding day.
" Oh!
This is really beautiful.
But, uh I think I'd rather wait until our wedding day to hear your vows.
Those aren't my vows.
Those are your vows.
Uh, Topanga, I appreciate your input, but don't you think I can write my own wedding vows?
You're right.
Why don't you try?
Okay.
Sometimes two people who love each other are in love.
And because of that love They love each other.
All right, you write the vows.
Okay, now, regarding our wedding night.
Topanga!
Bermuda.
I'll call you whatever you want.
No, Cory, we're gonna honeymoon in Bermuda.
It's the perfect climate, fabulous food, and just about the best darn snorkeling this side of anywhere.
But I don't want to be in the ocean.
I want to be in the room.
A lot.
Cory, why are you so obsessed with sex?
Because I don't get any.
Matthews, telephone.
Hold that thought.
Isn't my patient little Cory cute?
He's not gonna be so cute when his patient little head explodes.
Shawn's father had a heart attack.
What happened?
Did you hit me?
You had a heart attack.
Where are all the other patients?
You got your own room.
Well, that can't be good.
Jack paid for it.
Where is Jack?
He's outside filling out some forms.
Listen, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about what I was saying back at the apartment.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What the heck is wrong with her?
She thinks she caused your heart attack with her cake of death.
I didn't say my cake caused it.
I said it was a contributing factor.
Well, that sucker was rich, man!
I still got chest pains myself.
Come here, darling.
Not you, you moron!
Look, it weren't your cake of death what give me the heart attack.
It was Shawn's yelling and screaming.
I guess you're feeling better.
I'll go tell Jack you're awake.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I was so scared when it happened.
Yeah, dude, the way your eyes were bugging out of your head was totally cool, man.
Well, I'll tell you, it's worth living just to look at this lovely face.
Oh, you're such a sweet man.
Is there anything I can do for you?
There is something you can do for me.
Tomorrow's Jack's birthday.
If you could pick him up something nice for me to give him.
Oh, yeah.
You know what?
I think I have the perfect thing.
Take care of yourself, okay?
Rest up.
Okay, Chet.
Just try to relax, all right?
Hey.
He's asleep again.
Good.
Sleep is good.
You know, this is probably gonna sound crazy, but this whole ordeal could be a blessing in disguise.
Why would you say that?
He's gonna have to slow down, right?
So maybe he'll stick around for a while.
Jack, the second he gets out of here, he's going straight to Vegas.
Don't say that, 'cause you don't know.
No, I do know.
I know him.
I am him.
You're not, Shawn.
Yes, I am.
Why can't I get close to anybody in my life?
I'm exactly like him.
Look at you and me.
We're brothers, right?
We're not close at all.
Hey.
How you guys holding up?
Fine.
I'll be fine.
Thanks for coming down, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews.
Mr. Feeny.
Boys, take all the time you need.
Don't worry about school.
Just take care of your dad and yourselves.
Yeah, and you know that if you need to talk, we're here.
Shawn?
I'm fine.
Any way you could slip a little tequila in that thing?
You mean to go with that cigar you're hiding under the mattress?
You know, I'm dating this tall, beautiful redhead, but I'd drop her in a second for you, sweet buns.
You repulse me.
Well, he's alert.
Hey, how you feeling?
I've been better, been worse.
Feeny.
Mmm-hmm?
That's some college they got you at.
You're moving up in the world, huh?
They got a pool table and everything.
Maybe when you're feeling better, we'll play a little game of 9-ball?
I'll let you break.
You're on.
Um, Alan, could I ask you a big favor?
Anything you want, Chet.
Can you look after my boys after I'm gone?
Well, you're not going anywhere.
Chet, you're not dying.
I don't mean dying.
I mean when I move to Las Vegas.
Well, wouldn't you rather be here with your boys?
Please look after them.
Of course I'll look after them.
But I'm not the one they need.
Shawn?
Oh, hey, guys.
How you doing?
Good.
I was just Resting my eyes.
How's your dad?
Well, the doctor says he might need bypass surgery.
Is it okay if we go in and see him?
Yeah.
Yeah, he'd like that.
You okay?
He's lying in there.
He's sick.
I should be putting my arms around him and telling him that I love him.
But I can't, Cory, because I am still so angry at him.
You know, Shawnie, all these years he's been sort of blowing in and out of your life.
But now you got him right in there, and he isn't going anywhere.
Maybe I'm not the one you should be talking to.
How's he doing?
He looks so helpless.
Yeah, well, his nurse didn't seem to think he was so helpless.
I offered her a job taking care of him when he gets home.
I think you can still hear laughing.
He doesn't need a nurse.
I can take care of him.
Look, uh, he needs professional care, Shawn, you know?
I just, you know, arranged for it to happen.
It's okay.
Wow.
You've got this whole situation figured out, don't you?
I'm just trying to take care of things, man.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I guess it's easy to be efficient when you're not feeling what I am.
Don't tell me how I'm feeling, okay?
I'm his son, too.
Are you?
When you were a little kid, did you sit next to him while he watched TV all night long, hoping that he'd say something to you?
Did you ever once clean up after him when he came home drunk?
And when he didn't come home at all, did you lay in bed thinking it was something you did that drove him away?
And when he was gone, did you walk around and make believe that everything was okay, when inside it was tearing you apart?
Did you?
No.
No, I didn't get to do any of those things.
You see, I knew I had a father, and he was gone from me my whole life.
But you turned out okay, Jack.
Look at you.
You know who you are.
You deal with things.
Me, I'm just another version of him.
Shawn.
Oh, God, Dad, you're up.
I'm sorry I didn't do right by you, Son.
I'm a lousy father.
You heard what I said?
Yeah.
You been saying it your whole life.
I just never listened.
I'm listening now.
I've really screwed up, Dad.
It's like I'm watching myself do these things that I hate, and I can't stop them.
Why couldn't you just stick around?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
No, Shawn.
I wasn't good enough for you.
I need you, Dad.
I need you, too, Son.
And this time, boys, I'm staying.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not this time.
You mean it?
'Cause I feel like I feel like you're the only one who can help me.
We're a family.
It's about damn time we started acting like one.
Hey, hey, you.
You got a birthday coming up.
Here.
Open it up.
See what I got you.
Dad, what's wrong?
Maybe you better call somebody.
Shawn, uh Dad?
Somebody help!
A doctor!
I'm sorry, Shawn.
Dad?
Dad!
He's been up there a long time.
Guys, I really hope your dad's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
So do I. Chet is a fighter, boys.
And besides, he owes me a game of pool.
Hey.
You gonna open your present?
Yeah.
Well, that's something I don't have.
We lost him.
His heart wasn't strong enough.
I'm sorry, boys.
I'm sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Previously on Boy Meets World So, is this what you're doing for kicks now?
Hustling students out of their tuition money?
I'm not hustling, I'm teaching!
I'm teaching them not to play pool with a stranger, especially when that stranger's me.
Come on, boys, give your daddy a big hug!
You always do this, over and over and over again.
You come into town, you make all these promises, and just when I think we're actually gonna get close, you take off again.
Oh, my God.
I'm you.
Shawn's father had a heart attack.
I should be putting my arms around him and telling him that I love him.
But I can't, Cory, because I am still so angry at him.
I need you, Dad.
I need you, too, Son.
We lost him.
I'm sorry, boys.
Oh, I'd know those hands anywhere.
Shawn.
How you doing, honey?
Sorry.
I was just hoping it would be Shawn.
I know you're worried about him.
Yeah, I mean, since his dad's funeral, I can't reach him.
I don't know what to do.
Well, I have something that might cheer you up.
Is it Shawn?
No, The Fiancee Game.
I was gonna get this for you for a gift!
You lie!
I swear.
You know, it's supposed to tell you if you're ready to get married.
Trust me, I'm ready.
Well, we could play right now if we had another couple.
Hey, Cor, Pangers.
No.
Oh, come on, we'll kill them.
Eric, you want to play a game?
Oh, what do you got, Perquackey?
The Fiancee Game.
It's for engaged couples.
Oh.
I was almost engaged once.
We planned our whole futures together.
I hope he dies.
We don't actually have to be engaged to play the game, do we?
Not just dies.
Burns.
'Cause that would be okay with me.
I want to step on his face with a golf shoe.
That's very hostile.
Will you marry me?
Hey, why not?
We already live together, right?
That's right.
Yeah, we've actually been living together ever since she moved in.
You guys are gonna be toast.
Cory and I have been together for 17 years.
We'll kick your butts.
Now all we need is somebody to read the questions.
Mmm, no problemo.
Hang on.
Feeny?
I said, F-F-F-F-Feeny!
Come on, George Feeny, don't act like you don't know me.
Come on, we need you over here.
Hang on.
Get to stepping.
Hey, guys, this is gonna be great.
This dude can totally read.
Eric, I've told you a thousand times, leave me alone.
Afternoon, all.
How can I help?
We're playing a game and we want you to be the moderator.
You interrupted my quiet cup of coffee for Ooh!
The Fiancee Game.
Goody!
Okay, couples, take your seats and let's play The Fiancee Game.
This is gonna be so much fun.
Hey, what's going on?
I left, like, 10 messages.
Why didn't you call me back?
'Cause I don't want to.
Look, Shawn, we need to go down to Dad's trailer.
What's the rush?
Look, I know how hard this is, man, I really do, but we need to go through his stuff.
You do it.
Throw everything out.
You done?
Yeah.
But Shawn, you grew up there, all right?
You know what everything means.
I wish I did, but I don't.
You want to know what everything means?
Yeah, I want you to come down and tell me.
No, I can tell you right here.
I had a lousy relationship with my father that I don't want to relive, so I ain't going.
Shawn, we need to go down, okay?
We owe it to Chet.
We don't need to do anything.
What does that mean?
It means that Chet was the only real link between us, so now that he's gone, I don't think you owe anybody anything.
I'll do it myself.
Hey, Shawn, uh, your brother called a half hour ago.
Yeah, he got the message.
Mr. Matthews, we're waiting.
Tuna fish.
Salmon.
Not tuna fish.
Salmon.
Do you know you haven't got one question right?
You know, it is just a game, honey.
It's not just a game.
It's our future.
I hardly think this game is an indicator of our future.
Not tuna fish.
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, moving right along.
Rachel, what is Eric's favorite fish?
Penguin.
No, I don't think you understood.
Bam!
I know my man.
It's like we have one brain.
Yes, well, that's too easy.
Not one question right.
It's a game.
The questions were ridiculous.
A relationship is not based on fish.
You didn't know I was right-handed.
Okay, that was bad.
We don't know each other at all.
I think we have run out of time.
Uh, good night, everyone.
We won!
Oh!
Hey, we know each other pretty darn well, don't we?
Yeah.
But how did you know that when I shower Oh, that's not important.
We won!
We are so in sync it's scary.
You know, this really tells me something about us.
Yeah, well, we are good together, Eric.
Yeah, we are.
Okay, I'll see you at home.
Okay, I'll see you.
Bye.
Honey.
Eric and Rachel know more about each other than we do.
Topanga, it was a game, a stupid game!
You know what this means we have to do, don't you?
Topanga, it was a stupid, lousy, rotten game!
Live together.
That game's a genius!
Come here, you!
Aw, jeez, where do I begin?
Hey, change your mind?
I didn't mean we're not brothers.
Oh, hey, forget about it.
I just meant that with, you know, all this stuff that's going on between me and Angela, Cory and Topanga together all the time, and now Dad dying, I don't really feel connected to anything.
Hey, I'm here for you, man.
All right, thanks, man.
No problem.
Okay, so, let's do this.
Yeah.
Wow.
Oh, hey, his financial portfolio.
Oh, my God!
Do you know what this is?
What?
His unemployment stub number one.
Dad always considered this his first honest money.
Hmm.
Let's see here.
Okay.
"Past due.
"Final notice.
Pay up.
"We're not kidding this time.
" Why would he want to save these?
Well, Dad was a sentimental guy.
This one's weird.
What?
It's a letter to Chet from your stepdad.
Oh, hey, that's nothing.
I'll just take that.
No, no, no.
"Don't worry about paying me back, Chet.
"Shawn is Jack's brother, so he's practically family.
"We're happy to help out.
" Yeah, that's nothing.
No, no, pay him back for what?
Nothing.
For your shirt.
Pay him back for what?
For your tuition.
For college?
You know Yeah, Chet just couldn't afford it Wait, no, you and your stepdad decided to make us the charity case of the year?
Your dad wanted you to go to college so bad that he came to my stepfather for help.
Can you imagine how hard that was for him?
What else did you get me, Jack?
Nothing.
That was it.
Books?
Did you buy my books?
Maybe some books.
My shirt?
Really?
I would never pay for that shirt.
Come on, man.
I'm just trying to help out.
That's what families do.
We help out each other.
How have I helped you out?
What?
We're family, right?
Tell me one thing that I've done to help you out.
Here, take this.
Doesn't belong to me.
Nothing belongs to me.
The door's open.
Say!
Eric!
You weren't expecting me, were you, Hef?
What is it?
Topanga's coming over.
Well, you saw how in sync Rachel and I were.
It's obvious to me that we were meant to be together.
Congratulations and get out.
No, see, that's not the problem.
Congratulations and get out.
The problem is Jack.
I mean, ever since Rachel moved in, we've had this unspoken competition between the two of us.
Sometimes at night, I imagine he gets killed.
No, look, Jack is my best friend, okay?
And I just want to make sure that if this thing works out with Rachel that, you know, he's gonna be okay with it.
All right, listen, if you and Rachel really care about each other, then I'm sure Jack will understand.
Really?
Do you think so?
I couldn't care less.
Now get out.
You're a good brother, Cor.
Out.
Hey, Topanga.
Ooh, what'd you bring, toys?
Hey.
What do you think of my silk pajamas, huh?
They cost me $2,000.
They're nice.
Cory, why are the beds pushed together?
Oh, well, we are gonna be living together.
I just, uh, assumed that Cory.
You and I are living together to get closer as a couple.
This needs to be an ordinary night where we behave just as ourselves.
Nothing special.
Sex is the last thing we should be doing.
You are wrong.
You just are!
But I'm looking very forward to spending all the next few days together getting to know you better than I ever have before.
Huh.
Well, if I would have known we were just gonna do that, I would have bought the flannel pajamas with the feet instead of the silk pajamas and the silk blanket and these silk sheets!
And now I got blood on them!
You sure you didn't buy these, too?
Don't take those off!
I don't want to spend my life being a handout case, Jack.
I understand how you feel.
No, you don't!
You don't.
You know, I don't expect you to.
It's not your fault.
You know, I appreciate what you and your stepdad did for me.
Then why can't you just accept it and move on?
Move on from what?
Nothing is what I thought it was.
I don't know what I am anymore.
You're my brother in his underwear.
Now, would you please get dressed?
I'm gonna pay you back for everything.
You wanna pay me back?
I'm gonna pay you back.
Let me know who my father was.
What?
Yeah.
Why do you think I wanted to come down here so badly?
I wanted to find out just a little something about him.
You already knew more about him than I did.
No, no, the important stuff, man.
I mean, at least you have memories with him.
I mean, I was gone before I could have any, and now he's gone, and I guess I'll never have any.
That's probably a good thing.
How?
'Cause you're okay.
You're the lucky one, Jack.
There's no need for you to go through this kind of pain.
I mean, you look nice.
It's face cream, Cory.
It keeps my skin soft.
Take it off.
It scares me.
Cory Matthews steps up to the plate.
Clemens digs in, checks the runner on first, delivers the pitch, and Ow!
Ow!
Oh!
What?
Oh, get it off of me!
Get it off of me!
Oh, take it easy, you baby.
It's just a toenail.
Which toe?
The big daddy.
When did you last clip it?
I don't know.
A year ago?
Ugh!
Get it off of me.
Get it It's stuck in my face somewhere.
Topanga!
Gosh, take it easy, you baby.
It's just hygiene.
You know something, Cor, I was so into my own thing, I forgot to give you a little brotherly advice on this whole living together situation.
The first thing you're gonna have to do is get rid of the alien.
You know, call Mulder and Scully.
They'll know what to do.
Eric, it's me.
Pangy?
Damn, girl, you look bad!
Oh, and you got a toenail right here.
Look at that.
Ground rule double?
Yeah, off the Green Monster.
All right!
Hey, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up!
Get out of here!
All right, all right, all right, fine.
I got my own little kumquat at home, no big deal.
But I do want to do this before I leave.
Ew!
All right, peace.
I'm out, all right?
Cory, even that knows you better than I do.
Oh, relax.
It's just because Eric and I have lived together.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No, no, no, it is.
Listen, anytime you and I are together, it is always a good idea.
Okay.
I'm just gonna go wash my face.
Maybe then we can go to sleep.
Yeah, I'm just gonna get ready for bed.
Okay.
One, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
Please bless my mother and my father, and please let the new baby be healthy and live a good life and be a good person.
And please bless Eric and Morgan and Jack and Shawn.
And please help them get through this tough time.
And please take care of Chet.
And please don't let Shawn get too crazy.
And please bless Angela, and please let them always be together.
I mean, not that I'm pushing one way or the other.
It's just that I want everybody to be happy.
And please bless Topanga.
And thank you so much for bringing her to me.
And please let us always be together, no matter what happens.
Even if we're not completely compatible, please, just let us learn to be completely compatible.
And please bless Cory, who's the greatest guy I've ever known and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with.
You know why?
Why?
Because I want to change everything about you.
Oh, hey, Rach.
Hey, Jack.
So, how did it go down at the trailer park?
Shawn came down.
He did?
Well, that's great.
Is he okay?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, I hope so.
Well, how about you?
Oh, I'm fine.
You know, I'm good.
See, I'm the lucky one 'cause, uh, you know, I don't have to go through any of that pain.
You know, I just I didn't even know him.
I know.
I know.
It's okay, it's okay.
No.
You know, it's, um It's just that I'm trying real hard not to get In the way of his grief.
But I'll just I'll never get to know my real dad.
I know, Jack, but you can't keep this inside.
You just can't.
Yes, I can.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Jack.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for letting me have the room last night.
No sweat.
So?
So, do you know what the best part about being a virgin is?
What?
No, I'm asking.
So how you doing?
You okay?
I've been so angry I haven't been able to see straight.
Yeah, I kind of noticed.
But now that Angela's not in my life anymore, my dad's gone, I figure it's a good chance for me to get out of here.
Yeah, definitely.
I mean, um, you don't want to be hanging around in this trailer.
So come back to the dorm, you know.
We'll talk.
You and Topanga aren't living together anymore?
Yeah, but only during the day.
At night, she's scary.
But, uh, I love her, and we have our whole lives to live together and know each other.
I'm happy for you, Cory.
Thank you.
But I think I need to break away for a while, clear my head, find out who I am.
Shawn, you just lost your father.
He left me this trailer.
It's all he had.
And eventually, I'm gonna have to sell it off and start paying back some debts, but in the meantime, I was going to hitch it up and hit the open road.
Thought maybe you'd come with me.
What, you mean for the weekend?
Yeah, for the weekend.
Yeah, sure!
Whoo-hoo!
You know, we're young, we're wild.
Can I drive?
No.
All right, but I got shotgun.
Shawn, I don't understand why it was so important that we come here.
I want to say good-bye to Topanga.
Yeah, but we're going away for the weekend.
I'm not even saying good-bye to her.
We're here, okay?
Okay, but I wouldn't go in there.
I'm just saying good-bye.
Sheryl Swoopes dribbles down the lane.
She squares off to the basket, shoots!
Ow!
Scores!
Whoo-hoo!
What the heck was that?
She's beautiful, isn't she?
She looks like the Swamp Thing.
I know.
Let's go.
Good-bye, Topanga.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
All right.
Tank full of gas, the open road, and no destination.
Let the road be our guide.
Where we going, Shawn?
Man, this trip is exactly what I needed to take my mind off everything.
I'm so sorry about your dad dying.
You're not helping me, Cor.
I'm sorry about Angela.
How about I drive off a cliff right now?
Would that make you sorry?
Shawn, why are we really on this trip?
I'll tell you later.
When?
When the time's right.
Well, will you at least tell me when we get to wherever it is we don't know where we're going?
Yes.
What?
Well, it's just, you know.
No.
What?
Tell me.
Well, if one guy's wearing a bandanna, it's cool.
If two guys are, it's Ah, say no more.
The "one bandanna" rule has been enforced.
I'll just save mine for another time.
This is a real truck stop.
We have a real truck.
And we stopped here.
You know, I think I'm gonna get Topanga a hat.
Yeah.
She'd like one.
I'll get her a hat then.
How you doing, "Amy Sue"?
I haven't seen you here before.
What do you think?
I think you're cute.
What can I get for you?
"World's best hash browns.
" Good choice.
How about you?
His daddy died.
You should have the chicken-fried steak.
What kind of animal is that from?
Chicken fried steak.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm gonna have the chicken-fried steak.
Thank you.
I'm sorry your daddy died.
Thank you.
I can tell you mean that.
More gravy, Amy Sue.
You don't need it, Merle.
Hey.
You know, that looks like the guy from ZZ Top.
Hi, guys.
I love this place.
Where you from?
Philadelphia.
I always wanted to go there.
Is it scary?
Uh, not really.
I'm a cop.
Yup.
He's the chief of police.
How come you've never been to Philadelphia?
My dad says we're just fine here.
Yell if you need anything.
Hey, new guys.
I'm Stacey.
You know, this place is crawling with chicks.
Hi, Stacey.
You're searching for something.
I can tell.
Yeah.
I am.
She's peering into your freaking soul.
He's coming.
Well, hello there, authentic, grizzled, old roadside diner man.
Do you see her?
Yes, I do.
That's Amy Sue.
She's my daughter.
You're a lucky man.
Do you see her?
Yes, I do.
That's Sarah.
She's my daughter, too.
You must have quite a gun collection.
Do you see her?
Let's see you explain that one.
Stacey and Ali.
My daughters' best friends and just like daughters to me.
Watch yourselves.
Now, you look familiar.
Never been here before.
I didn't say you been here.
I just said you looked familiar.
Whoa, Betty.
All right, Shawnie, eat up.
We got a lot of road to cover in two days.
Cory, I'm not being fair to you.
You should go home.
What do you mean, I should go home?
What about you?
Oh, do you have to go home before we sing?
Oh, what, you girls got yourself a little band, huh?
You play a little Johnny Cash?
How old are you?
Uh, honey, I'm taken.
We don't get a lot of city guys around here.
We'd be interested to know what you think.
Oh, this'll be cute.
See, they wanna hear what we think of their band.
I hope they do that Achy Breaky.
I mean it.
You need to go home.
What do you mean, I need to go home?
What about you, Shawn?
I wonder if this band's any good.
Jack, we're gonna have to talk about this sometime.
Oh, good.
'Cause I thought you wanted to talk about it now.
I do.
I know.
You first.
Okay.
Um When we were kissing Just don't say anything stupid, okay?
See, I was just keeping everything bottled up Just don't say that it didn't mean anything, 'cause that would be hurtful.
Oh, no.
It felt like it meant something, but, you know, maybe it didn't.
This is where we kissed, you know.
I was just in a real vulnerable place that day, I guess.
Right.
Right.
Maybe it was just a friend comforting a friend.
Yeah.
Yeah, was just a friend comforting a friend.
Right.
Right.
That way, no one gets hurt.
Yeah.
Any reason to tell Eric?
No.
That would be hurtful.
Hey.
Oh, hey, I saw you two kissing.
We wanna dedicate this song to our two wandering guests.
You're coming back home with me.
Hey, I wanna hear them sing.
You are.
Wow.
Do you think we're any good?
You guys are awesome.
You shouldn't be here dishing our hash browns.
What do you think, mystery boy?
I agree with Officer Bob.
Good.
Because we want you to help us leave this town.
Well, what's stopping you?
He thinks the city's a dangerous place and something terrible's gonna happen to us.
Could you talk to him for us?
Yeah, it's just that he's very large, and, uh, I gotta get my friend here back home.
Come on, Shawn.
Cory.
I'm not going home.
Shawn, why do you keep saying that?
Because you're not hearing it.
That's what I needed to tell you.
I brought you on this trip so I could say goodbye.
Ok.
Goodbye.
Now let's go.
Life changes, you know?
People go separate ways.
Shawn, what, are you breaking up with me in a restaurant, in a public place so I won't make a scene?
You think I won't make a scene?
No, I know you'll make a scene, but I'm not going home.
Well, when are you gonna go back, then?
Maybe never.
Shawn, just because things are not going perfectly in your life does not mean that you tear everything up and end up in who knows where.
Sarah?
What, Shawn?
Can I see that picture?
Do you hear me here?
What do you think you're gonna find?
This one?
Yeah.
Well, how about that?
Look.
Ok.
Now it just got interesting.
You know that guy?
Kind of.
He's my father.
That's your father?
Hey, Dad.
No.
No, don't call him over.
He hates me.
Why do you guys have a picture of my dad?
Dad, hurry.
This boy bothering you?
I just stopped here for lunch.
This is Chet Hunter's son.
Yes, of course he is.
I knew you looked familiar.
Chet's been showing us pictures of you for I don't know how long.
I like the one where you're getting a bath in the sink.
Great.
You're Shawn.
Yeah.
How's medical school?
Actually, it's just college.
Chet always tells a good story.
And you're Cory.
Yeah.
The kid Shawn's always getting out of them scrapes.
Um, actually Now, how come there's a picture of my dad at this truck stop?
Chet wouldn't drive his rig between Pennsylvania and Ohio without stopping here and telling us some of his latest adventures, right?
That's right.
He also said that Shawn was perfect for one of your daughters, as I recall.
I don't recall that.
I recall that.
Which one?
It's me.
Well, Dad always did have good taste.
Thanks.
Now he's never coming home.
So, what's your daddy up to now?
Oh, Cory, none of these people know.
No, they don't.
Know what?
Well, I I hate to have tell you this, but My dad died last week.
So, who shot him?
Is it okay that people are laughing?
Of course it's okay.
Just thinking about that ugly son of a gun's face is enough to make you laugh.
Is it okay that I'm laughing?
Your father died, Shawn, but he ain't gone.
When someone you love leaves you, they're never gone.
They stay right here.
You know what I mean?
How well did you guys know my dad?
Pretty well.
He was He was always running from something.
He had that way about him.
I always thought he was running for something.
For what?
You.
You were all he talked about, kid.
Your father wanted to be perfect for you.
Well, he would've been perfect if he had just been there for me.
Well, Chet may not be here now, but the man deserves a toast.
Definitely.
But I'm horrible at these things.
Cory, would you say something?
No.
I'm mad at you, Shawn.
Are you mad at him?
No.
Do me the honor of a toast.
All right.
Chet Hunter was not a saint.
But, uh, you know, he loved Shawn as much as he possibly could.
And even if he wasn't always around to show it, we all know he wanted to be.
And I'm sure, if he could, he'd be right here with you right now.
I believe that.
I believe that, too.
To Chet Hunter, Shawn's father.
Hear, hear!
To Chet Hunter.
My father.
Eric, I am really glad that we're talking about this.
Yeah.
See, we didn't wanna tell you 'cause we thought it would make it all weird between us.
Yeah.
You know, when I saw you guys kissing, it bothered me.
And I didn't know why.
I didn't know if, like, I was jealous or I felt betrayed or Uh, you know what I think it was?
I think that Jack just He really needed a friend, and I tried to be that for him.
Well, you're a good friend.
You saw me, Eric.
I was in a dark place.
Right.
And you know what, come to think of it, I'll admit it, I may have gone a little too far.
Maybe I did, too.
Yeah?
Really?
So, you just all went too far?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So then we're still three friends.
You know what, I think we're better friends than we ever have been.
Yeah.
You know something?
This talking thing, this feels really good.
We should be able to talk about stuff when they just go too far.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok.
Well, um, I got some stuff in the dryer, so I'm gonna go, all right?
Eric's a stud.
That's good.
That's really good.
Yeah, you know, um, I really respect that when somebody can just come out and say how they're feeling.
No games.
I wanna kiss you.
I wanna kiss you, too, Jack.
I'm on a journey, Cory, so I've gotta stay on this journey.
Oh, you're on a journey.
It was a two-day trip.
Now it's a journey.
Soon it will be a voyage.
I'm looking for something, okay?
And I'm not gonna be able to find it at home, and I'm not gonna be able to find it with you.
Then why am I on this trip?
Why did you bring me in the first place?
So I could get your blessing.
'Cause I wanted to say goodbye.
Oh, you are sick, sir.
So this was a fling?
You know, I feel cheap.
Now give me the keys.
Whoa.
Give me the keys.
We are spending the night in the trailer.
No.
Give me the keys.
I am turning this trailer around and taking you home.
No.
You just wait until Feeny hears about this one.
Cory, I need your help, okay?
Tell me everything's okay.
Tell me I'm making the right decision.
Okay, fine.
You want my help?
Come here.
Go home, finish college, and work on your people skills.
We're gonna sleep on it.
Come here.
We need your advice.
Perhaps we should get up.
Right.
We wanna see if we can make it somewhere other than here.
Their father will never let that happen.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not leaving.
Amy Sue and I are all Dad has.
Sarah, we can't stay here the rest of our lives.
Look, this is a big decision.
Could you tell us what you really think?
No.
No, I can't, because I don't know you.
I don't want to.
I'm not gonna.
You can't make me.
You girls are better than every band I've heard at college.
I mean, you have a real shot out there.
And even if things don't work out, you'll never know what your lives are gonna be like if you don't see what else is out there.
So talk to your father, you know.
He'll understand.
He seems like a very understanding guy.
Why are you in here with my daughters?
I'm not.
Cory thinks we're good, Dad.
He thinks we should take a chance and leave.
She's a liar!
Why do you want my girls to leave me?
I don't.
It's just You know, there comes a time in every man's life, Bill You don't want me to touch you, do you?
Why don't you keep doing it and see what happens?
I was just gonna say, there comes a time in every man's life where he has to let go of the people he loves and, you know, let them find their own way.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about them.
I'm not talking about them.
I'm talking about me.
I want to go home.
Now, hold on, little man.
And I was almost out the door.
We'll stay here, Daddy.
You need help running the place.
You need us.
We'll stay.
Girls.
You're fired.
Thank you, Daddy.
We'll make you proud of us.
I'm already proud.
And if anything should happen to them, I'll hunt you down like a dog.
Then we'll see each other again soon.
Are you sure you're gonna be ok without us?
I'm not gonna be without you.
You're always right here.
Shawnie?
Yeah?
You're fired.
From what?
From me.
I mean, I don't know what you're looking for, but I guess you need to go away for a while to find it.
You sure, daddy?
We're sure, Bill?
I'm afraid so, kid.
Listen, if you ever need anything or you ever need my help I know.
It's so hard to let them go.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself, okay?
You gonna crank it up or what?
Dad?
Bet you didn't expect to see me, did you, Son?
What are you doing here?
You're looking for something.
I thought I'd try and help you find it.
That's very cool of you.
Well, I was always a cool guy.
I miss you.
I know.
But remember, I'm always right here.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
This is our first Valentine's Day since we broke up and very possibly the last one before we're married.
I want this Valentine's Day to set the stage for every Valentine's Day we share together for the rest of our lives.
Hey, I'm even wearing my red turtleneck for the romantic carriage ride.
So what are you wearing?
Pair of jeans, the same shirt I've had on for a week and Tommy Hilfiger socks.
Look, Cory, Valentine's Day is not really a big deal for me, so I'd rather not talk about it, okay?
Because you miss Angela?
Because I'm at a pay phone, and there are cowboys around.
Well, I miss you, buddy.
Okay, fine.
Aren't you going to say it?
Say what?
You miss me, too.
No, I'm not gonna say it.
You don't miss me?
Come on.
Let's not talk about this right now.
There ain't nothing wrong with wishing another man a happy Valentine's Day.
Isn't that right, boys?
Aw, hell, no.
Why, I got you a little something, Lucas.
Aw, chocolates?
Happy Valentine's Day, Cor.
Hey, happy Valentine's Day, Shawnie.
Shawn still on his quest for self-discovery?
Forget Shawn.
Enough Shawn and his search for himself and is he going out with Angela or is he not?
This Valentine's Day is about us, baby.
Ring-a-ding-ding.
Huh?
The focus is back on us.
I know Valentine's Day is very important to you, Cory.
Ring-a-ding-ding.
Huh?
You remember what happened last year, right?
Oh, please, let's not talk about last year.
No, no, no, last year Here we go.
Last year, we were I mean, you and I were I can't even talk about it.
Broken up because you kissed another girl?
Like an elephant, the memory on this one.
You know, what about you?
You kissed that soap opera guy.
You mean, the artist?
Whatever!
The point is, where have you been?
I mean, today was the day we were supposed to talk about our plans for Valentine's Day.
You knew that.
Morgan called me.
She needed a ride home from school.
Morgan, why did you call her?
Why didn't you call Mom?
You know today's the day before Valentine's Day.
You know I am trying to get the focus back on Cory and Topanga.
Mom forgot about me again, just like she forgot to buy the Valentines for me to hand out at school, which is why Bobby Porterfield thinks I don't like him, which is why he didn't invite me to his party tomorrow night.
I'm very sad about this.
Hey.
No.
Why don't we invite Morgan to spend Valentine's Day with us?
No.
No!
Do you want to hear what my answer is?
"No"!
Cory, this party was very important to your sister.
With the new baby coming, she's feeling very excluded.
You know who else feels excluded?
Me!
This is your sister.
This is why I never asked her out on a date.
Now, does our first engaged Valentine's Day mean nothing to you at all?
Of course it means something to me, Cory, but sometimes things come up that are more important than you and me.
Oh, what's more important than you and me, except me?
Sometimes things come up.
I hate that things come up.
I hate it.
I hate it!
Don't look at me if I repulse you.
I never said "repulsed.
" You laughed at me when I tried on the orange dress.
You looked like the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.
Eric, your mother is enormous for a reason.
Enormous?
Well, what do you want me to say?
I am seven and a half months pregnant.
I waddle.
I can hear my thighs rub together like a human cricket.
Ew!
My mommy said, "Thighs rub together.
" Ew!
Do you still love me?
No.
Of course I love you.
Look, look.
Look what I got you.
Dried fruit?
You got me dried fruit?
Well, I thought because it's fat-free Why don't you just paint Goodyear on my butt and fly me over the Super Bowl?
Mrs. Matthews?
What?
I think you are beautiful.
Hey!
No!
I have an idea.
No ideas!
Why don't we have a Valentine's Day baby shower?
Why don't we not?
Morgan, you can help me plan the party, and, Mrs. Matthews, it'll just be us girls.
That's discriminatory, and I won't stand for it!
Actually, it sounds very nice.
What's wrong with you, huh?
Why do you always have to help everybody?
You're sick!
You're a sick little girl!
She said, "nice.
" Baby shower it is.
We're going bowling.
Eric, tell Rachel she's invited, too.
Oh, cool, 'cause I know she doesn't have a date, and Jack and I have been meaning to do a little guy bonding, you know, since "the incident," So, uh Oh, idea!
All-guy card game, my house, Valentine's Day.
Bowling today, cards tomorrow.
I'm a man again.
This is a runaway train.
Topanga, I made dinner reservations a year in advance.
Didn't you hear Topanga?
It'll make your mother happy.
I need your mother to be happy.
You're hurting my shoulder.
Cory, I promise this won't interfere with our plans.
Blather!
I promise you a wonderful evening right after the shower's over.
I want insurance.
You have my word.
Your word means nothing.
What do you want?
I want to throw the shower.
Cory, it's for women.
You don't even belong there.
I don't care.
I belong with you, and I want my mother to have a joyous day and everybody out by noon.
Cory, you don't have to do this.
Oh, yes, he does.
I want you fat and happy.
That's an expression.
What do you know about baby showers?
Everything.
What's not to know about baby showers?
I am a baby-shower machine.
What do you really know about baby showers?
I've never even heard of one.
Remember, this is strictly platonic.
We're just friends.
Right.
Good friends.
The best.
Jack Jack I think we have to tell him.
We have to tell Eric about this.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
I should be the one to tell him.
I mean, I'm his best friend.
Uh, Jack, uh, do you know what?
Maybe we should stop until, um, we tell Eric.
Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah, we should stop this.
One more big one?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm just trying to liven up the party.
No one wants to play "Guess the Weight of the Pregnant Lady.
" But there's prizes, lady prizes.
I went to the bra store.
This baby shower stinks.
Yes, it does, because Cory thinks a baby shower is a bachelor party for pregnant ladies.
Honey, this is about a blessed event which I treat with deep respect.
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Huh?
Who could this be?
Let's have a look.
Ooh, the pizza delivery man.
I didn't order any pizza.
Did you order any pizza?
Let's see what he wants.
I got a hot slice for Mrs. Matthews.
There she is.
There she is.
Cory!
Forty-nine bucks, baby.
Your mother looks humiliated.
No.
She's having a great time.
Okay, stop.
Stop this now.
Well, this has never happened before.
Well, it has now.
Get out!
And leave the pizza.
Lady, the last thing you need is a pizza.
You know what?
The party's over.
Thanks.
I need to be by myself.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Thank you for coming.
Well, that was one great party, huh?
All right, now go get on your Valentine's Day clothes.
Cory, I'm not going out.
What do you mean, you're not going out?
All I wanted to do was something nice for your family.
Why?
Because they're going to be my family, too, someday.
Right.
They're going to be your family, too, someday.
You know why?
Why?
What?
Me!
Me.
You want to get to them, you go through me.
We had plans together, and I will not stand Where'd she go?
Sometimes plans change, Cory.
Take a hike, screw-up.
You know, dude, this is gonna be great.
You and me hanging out together, like we used to, you know.
Just like old times, before, you know, "the incident.
" Yeah, uh, listen.
I don't want to bring you down before the party, and this is, uh, something that's hard for me to talk to you about.
Aw, man, I am so insensitive.
Here you are still grieving over the loss of your father, I'm throwing a party.
You know something?
Let's forget about the party.
Let's go to the cemetery.
No, no, no.
Eric, that's not it.
It's, um Oh, I know what it is.
She's not that good a kisser.
No.
She's a good kisser.
You don't feel comfortable around her?
I feel comfortable around her.
You don't like girls.
You know, I kind of knew that I like girls.
Now, you see, you just think you like girls.
No, I like girls.
And I I like her.
Well, then, what do you want to say to me?
Hi.
Is there anything more delightful than Philadelphia in February?
Nine months is too damn long.
Eric, thank you for inviting me.
I love you like a son, my boy.
Okay.
What's wrong with Feeny?
On the way over, he said I look spiffy.
You're making me feel weird, George.
You look spiffy.
Oh, just keep it up.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's come over me.
I woke up smiling, laughing, humming little tunes.
It's very disconcerting.
Okay, dude, fix him.
He doesn't need to be fixed.
Well, that is not my Feeny.
Can't you see the man's in love?
How do you see that?
All right.
Listen, when two people are in love Hey, Feeny, you got that love thang?
No!
You think that's it?
No, no, no.
No, that emotion, I haven't been, uh, familiar with for so long that I couldn't possibly I think I'm crazy.
Feeny!
Feeny's in love.
With who?
Is it Feeny and the dean!
That's why she won't go out with me.
She likes you!
Feeny, you're in love with Dean Bolander?
No, no.
Although I have to admit that I do find the woman Jack, you think I'm in love?
Uh, well Sometimes two people are drawn to each other for reasons even they don't understand.
But love?
Love is a sacred thing, and your best friend should try to understand.
I am never throwing a baby shower for those broads again!
A baby shower?
That's wonderful.
It didn't go well?
No!
They don't appreciate anything.
I go to all this trouble of trying to find this great-looking guy to strip for Mommy, and they're angry at me.
Can you believe that?
There's a face.
Cheese poofie?
Cheese poofies will just make me fatter.
Ooh, these are good.
Mrs. Matthews, why don't you open your presents?
Because Cory probably gave me a muumuu.
Come on, Mrs. Matthews.
It'll be fun.
Yeah.
This one's from me.
Okay.
You know, after the baby's born.
Something special for mommy.
More like, for daddy.
Oh, that is very sexy, Mrs. Matthews.
I can't believe I'll ever fit in something like this again.
Oh, Mrs. Matthews, you're going to be so sexy, Mr. Matthews is going to get you pregnant all over again.
I hope not.
Here.
This one's from Morgan.
You probably won't like it.
Oh, honey.
It was the sweater I wore when you brought me home from the hospital.
I remember.
Why are you giving this up?
It's a baby sweater.
I'm not the baby anymore.
Morgan, you will always be my baby.
Thanks, Mom, but I'm old enough to know that I won't.
Okay, you know what?
We're going to spend some time together.
For the next six weeks, until the baby comes, you and I are going to be inseparable.
Whoa.
This day was important to me.
Topanga knew that.
It was a very important day to your mother, too.
Yes, but it didn't have to be today.
Today was our day, you know?
"Sometimes things come up.
" What came up?
Mom will still be pregnant tomorrow.
This was our first engaged Valentine's Day.
Cory, your mother needed this.
I needed to be with Topanga on Valentine's Day.
I needed to make up for last year.
You're being incredibly selfish.
I'm being selfish because I wanted to spend the one day you're supposed to spend with your girlfriend with my girlfriend.
Yeah, I'm a bad man.
Cory, you spend every day with her.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that, yeah, you can be in love with somebody, but the world still goes on around you.
Topanga knows that, you don't.
This is a lovely party.
It's Topanga.
Oh, see that?
She can't be without me.
I'm right.
You're wrong.
Ha!
For Dad.
Ha!
Again she disappoints.
Her water broke?
What does that mean?
Oh, dude, that means, like, whoosh.
The baby isn't due for another six weeks.
Can't they, uh, put the water back in, put some new water in?
Oh, well, that's that, then.
Thanks, Topanga.
Well, we're having a baby.
Right now.
Let's go.
Baby time!
Baby time.
Baby time.
Oh, uh, hi.
I'm having a baby.
I need my wife.
Mr. Matthews, it's okay.
They're just prepping her for her C-section.
Oh, but I wanted You can be in the operating room.
Oh, okay, where do I Right this way.
But I They already paged Dr. Taylor for you.
She's waiting.
Hang in there, dad.
Thank you.
Dad?
I like you calling me dad.
Keep it up.
Took care of everything, huh?
Yes.
Your dad's okay, your mom's okay, and I think that's everything that matters, right?
Yeah, that's everything that matters.
Cory, what's wrong?
Nothing.
It's just I mean, can we at least go get a cup of coffee together or something?
Cory, you're about ready to have a new baby brother or sister, and all you can think about is us?
Yeah.
So did you tell him?
Yeah.
Sort of.
What do you mean sort of?
Well, I'm not sure he gets it.
What do you mean you're not sure that he gets it?
Goo-goo.
Goo-goo-goo.
Goo-goo?
Yeah, there's a possibility he doesn't get it.
Rachel, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Jack, we have to tell Eric about us.
I know, I know, but I was thinking.
I'm thinking, you know, maybe it's not worth breaking up a friendship over.
I mean, it was one kiss.
And there was a second kiss and some hugging.
Come here.
Jack, no!
We can't do this here.
Um, you know what?
I've known Eric a lot less time than you have.
Maybe it would be easier if I told him.
Yeah, that's good.
That'd be easier on me.
Okay.
Yeah, go get him.
It's okay.
Eric?
Um, I need to talk to you.
Hey, babies.
What are you doing?
I'm getting to know the neighbors.
Come here.
Look at this.
You see this empty bassinet?
That's where the new baby Matthews is going to go.
Oh, that's really sweet, Eric.
Okay, everybody, this is my other best friend.
This one is Rachel.
Now, she is here to spend this most joyous day with me.
Best friend.
Um Eric?
Look, Rachel, I am really glad that you and Jack are here to spend this day with me.
Hey, um, how great are my friends, huh?
Oh, right.
One other thing.
I think they're in love with each other.
Hey, you're just in time.
I'm having a baby.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Alan, this one's a C-section.
You go up there.
Okay, what do you want me to do?
The only thing I want you to do is when you faint Uh-huh.
faint that way.
What makes you think I'm going to faint?
Because you're going to look over the drape while I'm making the incision, even though I'd advise you not to.
Oh, that's going to be a tough image to get rid of.
What a glorious experience.
You must be very excited about the new baby, Morgan.
I guess.
So what are we going to do?
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
I mean, do you guys want me to move out or No!
No, Eric, we don't want that.
This is really new to us, and it's not like Jack and I are ready to live together.
You do live together.
Yeah, but, Eric, we don't want anything to change.
No, we don't want anything to change, Eric.
Guys, you're kidding yourselves.
It has changed.
It will never be the same again.
I'm gonna move out.
All right, the nurse is going to help push as I pull the baby out.
You may feel some movement.
Uh-huh.
It should be over in a minute.
Alan, can you see the baby?
Oh, my God, honey.
It's a boy!
Another one?
Oh, it's okay.
Oh, he's beautiful.
You want to cut the cord, Alan?
Yeah.
Right here.
And now we'll give him a bath and return him to his mother.
Oh, hurry up.
I can't wait to hold him.
Oh, he's perfect.
Just like his mother.
All right, kiddo, bath time.
Doctor, his breathing is irregular.
What?
No, it isn't.
Get him to ICU.
Wait, wait.
There's nothing wrong with him.
Is he going to be okay?
This is just a precaution.
Well, where are you taking him?
Neonatal ICU.
You can follow the nurse there.
Alan, intensive care?
Oh, he's gonna be okay.
He's in good hands.
Why don't you try and decide on a name, okay?
Alan, you bring him back to me.
Cory, you transparent moron, if you sigh one more time, I'm going to give you something to sigh about.
Not for one minute on this nationally recognized day of love, did I not think about you and want to be with you.
Cory, we are here for a very important reason.
Believe it or not, but there are other things in this world more important than us.
I don't believe it, because that's why we're getting married, because there is nothing more important than us.
Uh I only got to hold him for a second.
Uh He's not breathing on his own.
They've got him on a respirator.
And, uh They, uh They don't know if He's just so small, so helpless.
Uh, I don't know how I'm going to tell your mother.
I can't decide between Joshua or Daniel.
Where's the baby?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh, Dr. Taylor.
Alan, Amy, I want you to meet Charlie Markman.
He'll be taking over your child's case.
Okay.
Why aren't you Dr. Markman is a neonatal pulmonary specialist.
He has far more experience than I do, and So you're not going to be our doctor anymore?
Amy, there's really nothing more I can do.
I promise you, you're in good hands.
Is our baby going to die?
No.
I don't know.
You don't know?
He has a respiratory infection because the early loss of amniotic fluid compromised his sterile environment.
So when can we take him home?
We're going to administer a course of antibiotics over the next 10 days.
And then we can take him home?
And then we'll see where we are.
You know, I think everything's going to be okay.
I hope so.
What do you mean you hope so?
You think something bad's gonna happen?
Something bad has already happened.
I know.
I just I want you to make everything better.
How do I do that?
Just be here with me.
I'm sitting right next to you.
I know, but I don't feel like you are.
Now, I want us to be Cory and Topanga again, because then everything is okay.
Here.
How does holding your hand make everything okay?
I just want us to be the way we used to be.
Valentine's Day used to be such a big deal to you.
What does Valentine's Day have to do with this?
And I was the one who didn't want to hold hands, but you were the one who said that holding hands is like touching souls.
How do you remember that?
I said that years ago when I was a child.
I remember everything you said because it was important to me.
Why don't you say stuff like that anymore?
Cory, look around you.
Do you recognize where you are?
Take my hand.
We're in the hospital.
This is real.
The reality is that your little brother is back there fighting for his life.
No.
Reality is this hand.
I don't like it when you use us to hide from the rest of life, Cory.
I don't like it that you're not Topanga anymore.
What?
Tommy dribbles down the backcourt.
He fakes left.
Left.
Tommy, left!
It is left.
Oh, right, sorry.
Okay.
He fakes left.
He shoots!
He scores!
They win the championship!
They win the championship!
And as a reward, Tommy gets to carry Eric's suitcase down to the car!
Not going to happen.
Why don't you get big girl to carry it?
'Cause big girl is with the rat, Tommy.
Is that why you're so sad?
No.
I'm not sad, actually.
That's It's the farthest thing from my mind.
Well, something's bothering you.
You're acting different.
Yeah?
How do I normally act?
Hi, big girl.
Hi, rat.
Hey, Tommy.
Eric, look, man, we told you, you don't have to do this, okay?
No, Eric, please don't move out.
This isn't what we wanted to happen.
This is the right thing to do, guys.
No, no, no.
The right thing to do is not even think about this right now.
Eric, you shouldn't even be here.
You should be at the hospital.
Pancakes!
What?
The International Hospitapancakes!
Is that what you were gonna say there, Rach?
Hmm?
What's the matter with you?
Oh, nothing.
I don't want Tommy to know about the hospital.
Who's in the hospital?
See what you just did?
Huh?
Look, I mean, I don't want the kid to know about the baby, all right?
The kid's got no family.
He comes over here once a week to hang out with his big brother Eric.
The kid doesn't need to know about this.
The kid wants to know who's in the hospital, Eric.
All right, little man.
Come here.
Okay, Tommy, um, see, I've got this new little brother.
But, you know, don't worry, 'cause you're still my little brother, too.
But, um, see, this new little guy, he's, uh, pretty sick.
Can we go see him?
You want to go see him?
If he's your little brother, then isn't he my little brother, too?
Hi.
How's the baby?
No change.
I'm really scared, Angela.
I feel so bad for everybody.
How's Cory handling it?
He's not.
He's not even dealing with it.
All he can talk about is holding hands and making everything go away.
Like just because we're together we're automatically protected from life.
What is that?
We're not kids anymore, Angela.
No, you're not.
You're handling it very maturely.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
Angela.
I'm not 12 anymore.
And when I was, I was like the strangest kid in the universe.
Oh, well, you still got some strange in you.
You know, I remember this one time, I was trying to help Cory with this poem we had for school, not just the words of it, but the essence behind it.
I went over to his house.
He read the poem, and I danced.
All around his kitchen.
And I put lipstick all over my face.
And why do we remember that story so well?
Because I always thought that was the moment he fell in love with me.
Boy, you know, he always used to be the one bringing me back to reality.
I don't know what happened to him.
Oh, honey, you did.
You're the greatest influence in his life, Topanga.
He needs you to take his hand, dance around him, help him through what's going on right now.
Baby, without you, all he has is reality.
Oh, boy.
Do I not cherish Topanga?
Oh, here we go into Coryland.
Did I not raise her and bring her into my home?
Who talks like you?
You know, I go to you, I know exactly what I'm getting.
"Hello, Mr. Matthews.
"Here's your sensible advice.
" I'm on my way.
You are my sensible, go-to guy.
Okay, but she is not what she used to be.
What did she use to be, Mr. Matthews?
Not sensible.
She was Topanga.
Now she's Phyllis Munson from Piscataway, New Jersey.
Topanga Lawrence is one of the best people I know.
I know.
So what's happening to her?
You've known her as long as I have.
She's growing up, Cory.
So are you.
Why does she have to grow now?
At a time like this?
Do you want to go see how your little brother is doing?
Yeah.
Want me to go with you?
Yeah.
My homework's going to be unbelievably late this week.
Yeah, what else is new?
Hey, Karen, Paul.
How's she doing today?
She's a little better today.
She has much better color, don't you think?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She looks great.
Yeah, she does.
She looks great.
Michael.
How's your son?
I think he smiled at me.
Hey.
Say one for my boy, will you?
Oh, these are for all of us.
Come on, kid.
Let's get better and get out of here.
I've got a much better place for you at home.
Come on, kid.
Joshua.
What?
I decided on Joshua.
Then Joshua is his name.
Joshua Gabriel Matthews.
Gabriel means "he who God protects.
" Well, how's Joshua doing today?
The doctor says we should talk to him.
He said we should tell him who we are.
Hey, Joshua.
I'm your father.
And I love you.
And I want you to get better and get out of here.
Come on.
Joshua.
Gabriel.
Come on, God.
See, buddy, he's still here.
Okay.
Time to take you back now, Tommy.
Are you going to come back after you drop me off?
Yep, I'm going to come right back here, and I'm gonna tell him all about you.
I'm gonna tell him how you spent the whole day with him.
He knows I did.
Hey!
Hey!
All right, come on, saddle up.
Giddyap, horsie.
Okay.
Bye, Topanga.
Bye, Angela.
Bye, Morgan.
Bye, Mr. Feeny.
Bye, Cory.
Bye, big girl.
Bye, rat.
Cory, I feel like we're really distant.
Why would you say that?
Because for the first time in my life, I feel like I don't know how to give you what you need.
Why not?
Because we can't go through life together if you expect me to be able to change what's real for you.
Well, you used to be able to.
We were kids!
Nothing bad ever happened!
The worst thing that happened was that your Pop-Tart fell on the ground.
Mmm-hmm.
And you held it up to the sky, and you said, "God made dirt.
Dirt won't hurt.
" Right?
But it was still dirty.
Yeah, but I ate it anyway.
I didn't have to, but I did because you said to.
Now, I want you to make everything better, Topanga.
We can't have that relationship anymore.
Why?
I'm not like that anymore.
Why not?
I don't know how to be like that anymore.
Cory, this is bad.
There isn't anyone who can make it better.
Cory!
Shawnie!
Hey!
Look, everything's going to be all right.
You think?
I know.
I tried to reach you guys at the dorm and Angela told me what happened.
I drove back as fast as I could.
Hi, Mr. Feeny.
Hello, Shawn.
So?
How's the baby?
It's really serious, Shawn.
No, he's going to be fine.
He's so small.
He's having a hard time breathing, and he can't fight the infection.
He's going to be fine.
Will you please talk to him?
I can't get through to him right now.
You're his best friend.
He'll listen to you.
Okay, let me handle this.
Man, are we going to have fun with this kid.
The kid's going to be our slave.
I'm going to teach him everything I know.
Then I'll bail him out of jail.
Mr. Feeny, will you say something to them?
Hey, Mr. Feeny, I think you're going to have another Matthews to teach.
Maybe he'll have a kid like me to sit next to.
He won't have to.
Why not?
You'll still be there.
Ouch!
Aren't you going to say anything to them?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Boys, I hope you're right.
With all my heart, I hope you're right.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey, Mr. Matthews.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Mrs. Matthews.
Is everything okay?
No.
Joshua hasn't responded to the antibiotics yet.
Dr. Markman was kind enough to sit with us for the last three hours.
Thank you.
Of course.
Wait a minute.
You gave him more medication?
We've given him all the medicine we can give him.
We've been in there sitting with him and talking to him, and what happens next, it's up to Josh.
The doctor thought it would be a good idea if you went in to say hello to your brother, too.
Yeah, sure.
But I'd like you guys to come.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Family only.
Uh, he is family.
Hi, Josh.
I'm Cory.
You have to get better, okay?
I always wanted a little brother.
This is Topanga.
She's going to be your sister.
Hey, Josh.
Look, you got to let the medicine get you better, okay?
You've got a lot of people who really love you.
Please get better, Josh.
My gosh.
He's He's so helpless.
Hi, Josh.
I'm Shawn.
Look, this is the second time I've been in the hospital this year, and I don't really like the way that first one turned out, so I want you to listen to me.
I've been out of town.
See, I was in a real bad way, and I went looking to see what was important in my life.
I met a lot of people out of town who were looking for the same thing.
Now you're in a real bad way.
I came back here because I want to tell you something.
Don't go out of town.
Don't go anywhere.
Life is right here with these people.
With your family.
And my family.
We got the greatest family there is, Josh.
We want you to be with us so we can watch you grow and see you change and make great memories together.
Thank you for remembering who I was.
You're in my heart.
You're in my heart, too.
And them?
Well, they'll grow on you.
Okay!
Ladies and gentlemens, presenting for your entertainment pleasure, the amazing Flying Tommy will perform for you his world-famous Close the Suitcase With His Tushie.
Could I please have a drum roll from the cheating roommates?
Eric Drum roll!
Go, baby!
Huh!
Ta-da!
Whoo!
Oh, thank you very much!
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
And now, for our next trick, we shall disappear.
Eric, Eric, I can't believe you're really going to move out.
It's for the best, Rach.
I hope you guys are so happy.
That's enough, Eric.
Eric, that's enough.
Eric!
Still best friends?
Yeah.
Never changes, man.
Hey!
What's that about?
Hey!
Tommy, bring the car around, all right?
You're driving.
So What now?
Alan, what are you doing?
I'm saying a prayer.
For everybody that has to be in there.
Well, Joshua Gabriel.
Let's go home.
Hey.
Hey, hey!
All right!
Joshua Gabriel.
My little brother.
What kind of place is this, huh?
First I lose my dad here, and then this little miracle, a new brother to watch grow up.
I get my family back.
So, you're tired of tumbling, tumbleweed?
Yeah.
There's too much going on here to be someplace else.
Cory?
Yes, darling?
You still want to be my Valentine?
Yes, darling.
Would you rather I was like the old, strange Topanga?
Well, no.
It's not like I don't like the new, strange Topanga.
I mean, it's important for us to grow, but I just I don't want to lose what's so special about you.
You never will.
Because I'm in your memories.
And you will always be here to remind me.
Use a mirror, babe.
Remind me of what?
That no matter how difficult life gets, the important thing is to live it with hope.
Now, that sounds like you.
Valentines?
Valentines.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Cory, are we going to do this?
We're going to do this.
If we're going to do this, we have to do it.
It doesn't just happen.
Leave me alone.
We have to pick out invitations.
I have to start looking for dresses.
But We need to pick out rings, a caterer, a florist, a band, a photographer, a cake.
But.
But-but-but what?
But we haven't even set a date yet.
We don't set the date.
Any banquet hall worth having your wedding in books up two years in advance.
We pick the hall, the hall picks the date.
I'm so tired.
Hall.
We have to pick out a hall.
Are you helping or not?
Just let me sleep for half an hour.
I promise.
We've been hanging out with each other for a long time now.
Yeah.
So, what's the problem?
The problem is, I'm not getting any younger, okay?
What?
I'm the oldest kid at St. Mary's.
I don't even fit in my bed anymore.
Well, what do you want me to do, Tommy?
Are you going to adopt me, or not?
What?
You said we were the best team since Scooby-Doo and Shaggy.
Oh, well, we are, buddy.
But they're not going to let me adopt you.
I mean, they're just not.
They're going to tell me it's impossible.
Scooby didn't think it was impossible when Shaggy fell into the well.
You know what he did?
Tommy, this isn't a cartoon.
He saved him.
He saved him because he loved him.
You know I love you, Tommy.
Then why won't you save me?
Topanga, listen.
I gotta tell you, I feel very uncomfortable being at a wedding that we weren't invited to.
Cory, it goes on all the time.
Mr. Beckman, the wedding planner, said that as long as we keep a low profile, everything will be okay.
These things are delicious.
You know, you guys should get married here.
Our wedding will never be this beautiful.
And why not?
Because we'll never be able to afford a wedding like this.
Wait a minute, your dad's not rich?
No.
Bye.
Let me make you understand this from a personal standpoint.
My daughter likes nice things.
How are you going to give her nice things with that thing you call a salary?
Well, that depends on how you define "nice things," Stan.
I love Jessie, that's a nice thing.
We're going to be together for the rest of our lives.
That's a nice thing, too.
You're upsetting me.
Jessie drives a Jag convertible.
How do you plan to keep her in a Jag convertible if you don't come into my company?
I keep telling you, Stan, I'm not coming into your company.
When I tell you what's right for your life, why don't you listen to me?
I'm happy where I am.
Teaching kindergarten?
Ooh, you know, listen, I would like to stay and talk to you, Stan, but I've got to go marry your daughter now.
Don't you walk away from me.
No respect.
This guy won't listen to me.
How could my daughter fall for somebody who won't listen to me?
Mr. Beckman said I could stand here.
In one hour, my daughter's gonna be married to a teacher of kindergarten.
You know, my kindergarten teacher was Mr. Feeny.
As a matter of fact, he has been my teacher every year of my entire life.
Isn't that curious?
You a friend of my daughter or the loser?
Uh, neither one, sir.
"Sir"?
You called me sir.
That's a term of respect.
I like that.
You know what he calls me?
Stan, like it says on the side of my trucks.
You're Stan, Stan, the Plumber Man?
If I can't flush it No one can!
I like you, kid.
I like you, too, Stan, Stan.
You would listen to me when I'd talk to you, wouldn't you, kid?
Oh, yeah.
I believe a lot of my generation would be much better off listening to their elders, instead of wearing those fancy-schmancy backward hats and having those bolts through their heads.
That's a beautiful sentiment, kid.
Let me ask you something.
Anything, sir.
Who are you?
What the hell are you doing at my wedding?
My name's Cory Matthews.
I'm here with my lovely fiancee, Topanga.
Isn't she lovely?
They're all lovely with the lights off.
I wouldn't know, sir.
You're a virgin?
I'm cursed, sir.
You're it, kid.
I'm it for what?
I choose you.
Choose me for what?
You're the type of nice kid I always saw with my Jessie.
But isn't she marrying the kindergarten teacher?
No.
No.
No?
But doesn't she love him?
I don't love him.
I love you.
And so will she if I tell her to.
Me?
But why me?
Because you're a nice, polite kid who listens to me and respects me like the son I deserve.
I'll give you a million dollars to marry my daughter.
A million?
That's just crazy!
Negotiation?
We're in negotiation?
What a kid!
You just keep getting better and better.
That's very nice of you, Stan, but I have a girl over there on the side.
Hey, who doesn't?
Come on.
You've got 20 minutes to break this up.
What are you, crazy?
Honey.
No, even for him this is nuts.
He can't even take care of himself.
You know something?
I resent that.
I resent the heck out of that.
I'm a grown man.
I am fully capable of taking responsibility for another human life.
Your fly is open.
I know!
Now, look, I demand you take me seriously, all right?
I love Tommy and he loves me.
Now what?
Listen to me, okay?
Tommy wants me to adopt him.
I didn't come here for your permission.
I came here for encouragement.
I guess I came to the wrong place.
Eric, you would make a great parent to Tommy someday, but not now.
Why not now?
Because you don't have a job, because you don't have a home.
You sleep on our couch.
You think I like sleeping on your couch?
You know why I sleep here?
It's 'cause I've got nowhere else to go.
I lost my best friend to the girl of my dreams, I lost my brother to the girl of his dreams, I lost Feeny to the dean, and I lost you guys to the new baby.
Oh, that is just so silly.
Look at this, it's true.
Everybody I know has somebody that they want to dedicate their life to.
Now that I finally have that, you're trying to discourage me.
Eric, even if we agreed to this, they won't let you adopt him.
You can't support him, you can't give him a home.
You are a great big brother.
Be that.
That's what he needs from you.
No, you know what Tommy needs?
Tommy needs me.
That's what he needs.
And I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that he's got me.
'Cause that's what's best for him, that's what's best for me.
Now I'm going to go call St. Mary's and have them put Tommy on hold or, you know, layaway or whatever.
Why are our children so crazy?
Please don't be crazy, please be normal.
They may be crazy, but they have good hearts.
Have a good heart, like your brother.
Oh, Alan, you're saying you're going along with this?
The kid just pulled his shirt out of his fly.
No one else could do that.
Some other people want to adopt Tommy.
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause I'm not going with them.
I don't think you have that choice, Tom.
I, um Does he?
Actually, he does.
We would never place a child with a family he didn't want to be with.
Especially when there's an emotional conflict.
What's the emotional conflict?
You are.
Oh, boy.
I told them I wouldn't go with anybody else.
Oh.
Look, Tom, if these people are good enough to adopt you, then I'm sure they're going to be good enough to let me keep being your big brother.
We'll just tell them that I come along as part of the deal.
That's not going to work.
Why?
Oh, I know why.
'Cause you're afraid after they meet me, they're going to like me better than you.
That's pretty selfish, Thomas.
They live in California.
They live in California?
Yeah, they do.
I don't want them to live in California.
There's nothing I can do about that.
You know, maybe there's something I can do.
I would like to adopt Tommy, please.
Eric, maybe we should discuss this in my office.
I want Eric!
I pick Eric!
Hey, kids, I'm getting adopted!
I'm getting adopted.
Yes!
This is, like, the happiest day of my life.
Take the money.
But I love Topanga.
We all do.
Take the money.
Shawn, money can't buy me Well, let's see if it can.
Take the money.
No, I'm not taking the money, okay?
I love Topanga more than the money.
Topanga is my life.
Cory, you're not supposed to be just standing around.
You're supposed to be doing research.
I know.
I was gonna.
"I was gonna.
" Do you know what that means, Angela?
Yep.
You're going to do everything by yourself.
Ugh.
Cory, I don't ask much of you.
And you, you're his best friend.
You're supposed to help him.
Help him.
Cory, I can't do this all by myself.
Now, I want you guys to be taking notes during the wedding so we can decide what we want and do not want for our own wedding.
Are you guys listening to me?
Well, fine.
If you're not taking the money, I am.
What's he talking about?
Money.
We were talking about money.
We don't have any.
I know.
Cory, I wish our wedding could be this beautiful.
Don't you ever wonder what it'd be like to have all the money in the world and you could just do whatever you wanted?
No!
Never.
Where do you get these meshugge ideas?
How ya doing?
Do I know you?
No, but you want to know me.
You know why?
'Cause rumor has it you're unhappy with your daughter's choice of life mate.
Cut to the chase, Spanky.
From the moment that I laid my eyes upon your beautiful daughter's face, I knew that she was making the biggest mistake of her life because she wasn't marrying me.
Really?
You want to marry my daughter?
No, no.
Not want to, must.
Must marry her, must work for you.
You know why?
Because you're a winner, and I'm a winner.
And we winners need to stick together and marry each other's daughters.
I'll go first.
You know, it's interesting.
I was just talking to that curly-headed kid who's happy with his girlfriend Ugh, mustard.
Stop!
And I looked at that kid and I listened to that kid and I knew he was worth a million dollars.
Irony of ironies, you come along, and I'm prepared to make you the following offer.
Well, I'll be honest with you, 'cause I got a number in my head, and I know what I'm worth I'll give you 20 bucks to get the hell away from me.
Okay.
Boy, you sure like to get a lot of information before you let somebody take a kid, huh?
Well, normally we just pull names out of a hat.
But we really like Tommy.
This is the background on the other couple interested in him.
You're allowed to show me that?
No, I'm not.
But in this case, you being the big brother and wanting what's best for Tommy, I think it'll be okay.
Tommy's been here a long time, and we really care about him as much as you do.
We wouldn't place him with just anybody.
I know, but, I mean, come on, why do they have to live in California?
They used to live here in Philadelphia.
That's when they adopted their first child from us.
A little girl three years ago, Sara.
Well, I mean, they can keep Sara.
I don't have a problem with that.
We used to get lots of letters from Sara telling us how happy she was.
Then we got fewer letters, and then they stopped coming.
'Cause she wasn't happy anymore.
'Cause we weren't her family anymore, they are.
As much as it hurts, we love it when the letters stop.
Here's a note from her mother.
"Dear Mrs. Gallagher, here is Sara's third-grade picture.
"As you can see, she's growing into a beautiful young lady, "and we never realized it was possible to love someone so much.
"The one thing that could make our family more complete "would be a brother for Sara and a son for us.
"We can't stop thinking about Tommy and how happy we would all be together.
"Thank you so much for considering us.
" I love Tommy, too.
I know.
Now you just have to decide how much.
Look, Dad, I packed all my stuff.
I'm all ready to go.
Isn't it cool the way I call you Dad?
Yeah, Tommy.
It's way cool.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Come on.
What?
I can't be your dad, Tommy.
Why not?
Come here.
These people in California, they sound really nice.
But I want to be here with you.
You're going to have a mom and a dad and a house with a big pool and a big sister and a dog named Waldo.
I don't need a dog.
I have you.
Eric, I'm never going with anybody except you.
I'm not going to adopt you, Tommy.
Why not?
Because I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Tommy.
I'm not going to adopt you.
I don't like you anymore.
I'm sorry to hear that, Tom.
And now I'm going to California to be with people who care about me.
Good for you, Tommy.
Good for you, man.
Good for you.
Do you realize what you could do with a million dollars?
Why does that man keep talking to Cory?
It makes you mad, doesn't it?
You should break up with him.
I think the first thing I would do would be to buy a Volvo.
He's buying a Volvo.
He's keeping my little girl safe with the steel cage and the side air bags.
Give your old man a hug.
Okay, but I got to tell you, Stan.
I am not interested in your money or your daughter.
Daddy, aren't you going to walk me down the aisle?
I was just finishing up a business discussion with my friend Cory.
Hi, Cory.
Thank you for coming to my wedding.
Come on, Dad.
It's now or never.
Think carefully, kid.
You'll never get this kind of chance as long as you live.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join Jessica and Edward in holy matrimony.
This whole thing is so out of our league.
They'll probably get in some private jet and honeymoon in Tahiti.
In some private romantic villa on some nude beach.
You just saw the bride?
Ooh, yeah.
Can you imagine the kind of honeymoon they're going to have?
Yeah.
Could you just imagine?
No.
If there is anyone here present who might give just cause as to why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.
What are you doing?
Spasm.
Young man, do you have something you'd like to say?
Yes, yes, you do.
Say something, kid.
What are you doing?
Do you mind?
I'm talking to my son-in-law.
Go ahead.
Okay, we're going to do this now, all right?
Okay.
Okay.
We're going to do it.
We're going to get up.
We're getting up.
Attaboy.
Attaboy.
Good, you're up.
You're up.
Go to it.
All right.
Hi.
I don't know any of you, but, um, I guess I should say something very important here.
All right.
Everybody listen to this.
This is important.
Listen up, honey.
Um, this is the greatest place to get married that I've ever seen, and I would give anything to be able to get married in a place like this.
But I can't, so it doesn't matter.
Cory, will you please tell me what's going on?
What's going on is that when you love somebody, nothing else matters.
Not the money, not where you get married, nothing like that.
All that matters is who you're standing next to.
And the only person I want to stand next to is you.
So, Jessie, Eddie, I wish you two what we have: true love that you can always count on.
Let's go.
This is their day.
We'll have our day.
Two million!
Eric, you did the right thing.
There's nothing to think about.
Yeah, he's in the best possible place that he can be.
When he gets older, he'll realize what you've done for him.
He hates me.
He's a kid.
Kids are resilient.
You must have hated me a billion times when you were a kid.
Yeah, you never tried to get rid of me.
Ha, very funny.
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, guys, but I think I need to be alone.
I'm very mad at you.
I know.
But I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.
Hey.
What's your problem?
You.
Her.
This.
You had your chance.
Yeah, you're right.
Can I at least have the grapes?
Knock your socks off.
They're already off.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Feeny!
You.
Here.
Sit.
Now.
Eric, don't use that Dean Bolander.
Okay, what you got?
How old are you now, Mr. Feeny?
What, 90, 100?
A hundred.
What do you want?
Not what I want, it's what you want but you're not going after.
Eric, my relationship with Dean Bolander will proceed at my pace, not yours.
You are such a scaredy-cat.
I mean, here's a woman that you've obviously got the hots for and you're not gonna do anything about it.
Mr. Matthews, don't reduce my feelings for the woman to "the hots.
" Unless, of course, she used that term.
Mr. Feeny, you've been good to me over the years.
You taught me everything I never paid attention to.
It's payback time.
Oh, no, no, payback time.
I don't want it.
Eric It's out of your hands, Feeny.
Sorry.
Out of your hands, Feeny.
I beg you Eric Dean Bolander is the kind of woman that you have to romance slowly, carefully.
Like an orchid.
I'm a gardener.
I know these things.
Stop selling me, girls.
I like the man very much.
But he needs to pick up the pace of this dance.
Isn't there anything to be said for the old-fashioned approach?
Yeah.
Oh, I know.
He needs to do something.
He needs to express his feelings.
Goodness knows I've been dropping the man hints left and right.
Well, maybe you're being too subtle.
I hiked up my skirt at the seminar.
Damn!
Feeny, the time is now.
Every second you wait is another clogged artery.
You know, my cholesterol level is high.
George, if not now, when?
Now.
That's right!
You are the man, you are the man!
Oh, will you get lost!
I'm lost, I'm lost!
Just bring her home.
Excuse me.
Um, Dean Bolander.
Yes?
There's something that I have been meaning to say to you There she is!
Lila Bolander, the eighth wonder of the world!
Curtis!
He must know her.
Well, Curtis, what's it been, 15 years?
All this time, I'm running around the world, digging up bones, and you're here not aging a day.
Doesn't seem fair.
But I like it.
Relax, this guy's got nothin'.
I want you to meet someone.
George?
This is my colleague and friend George Feeny.
Curt Kincaid.
Put it there!
A pleasure, Mr. Kincaid.
Oh, come on.
What's with the mister?
It's doctor.
Dr. Kincaid.
Curtis is in town to speak at our science seminar.
He's made some top-secret find in Africa.
Oh, just a little something that will change the course of the new millennium.
So then you're an archeologist?
George, please, that makes me feel like a geezer with a compass.
I prefer fortune hunter, adventurer, or my personal favorite, Lila's ex-husband.
Ex, it's no problem.
But I'm here to win her back.
You know what?
You've been alone this long.
How about, you know, like, a puppy?
And the man stepped in between them.
And the course of true love for one of our own may have forever been altered by this schifosa.
Why do you come to us now?
On this, the day of our bake sale?
Well, 'cause this just happened, like, five minutes ago.
Okay.
What do you need?
I need for you to do me this favor.
You need me to do you this favor?
You never invited me into your home.
You never invited me for a cup of coffee.
Yes, I know.
And for this I am sorry.
But we must help Feeny, but he mustn't know that it is us.
This is the biggest job we've ever attempted to pull off.
I come to you with my hat in my hand It's my hat.
It's my hand.
Are you in, or are you out?
Eric, we're flattered you've come to us.
But look around.
We're legitimate now.
We're in the bake sale business.
Guys, it's Feeny.
He's family.
This may be his one chance at true love.
Eric, I just spent 68 bucks traveling around this country.
I learned a few things about life.
Why don't you tell him what you learned, Shawn.
I love this part.
I learned to be at peace with myself.
I like looking over my shoulder and not worrying about who's coming after me.
These schemes and capers I used to hatch, they only lead to despair.
That's what I learned.
I also learned never to park a trailer across a railroad track when that thing is down.
Besides, Eric, I hit a teacher, remember?
Yes.
The dean put me on probation.
I do one thing wrong, I'm outta here.
Don't you think that Feeny can take care of himself?
I'm ashamed.
I am ashamed to call you guys my brother and Shawn.
He ate the paper.
What's the matter?
Jack, you know, I really love this.
But have you noticed that this is all we do?
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
Yeah, yeah, it is great, Jack.
But I want more.
Oh, thank you!
Well, more is right this way.
Oh, Jack, no, I mean, I want us to be a couple.
We are a couple.
I want to go out, Jack.
We haven't gone out since we've become a couple.
I mean, why don't we ever go anywhere?
We go plenty of places.
First we went there, then we went there, and now we're gonna go up there.
Jack, I wanna be with people.
I wanna go dancing.
Uh Um, let's go to the movies.
The movies are dark, and no one will see us, and I wanna show you off.
I wanna go dancing, Jack.
You can dance, right?
Yeah, I can dance.
Great, then we'll go dancing tomorrow night.
Oh, Jack, this is going to be so much fun!
I can't wait.
So, I jump off the cliff, grab hold of a big old branch, jungle-gym to the river, and never saw Chief Yakazo's ugly mug again.
And the cursed ruby of the Tzang-Kwai now resides in the Turkish Museum of Natural History diagonally across from the Hard Rock Cafe.
The end!
Wow.
Wow.
Hey, whose side are you on?
Well, thank you, Dr. Kincaid, for that, uh, vivid story, which provides us with a perfect transition into today's assignment, where on neighboring Crete we will find Sir Arthur Evans excavating at Minoan Knossos, beginning in 1899.
You're dying.
Do something.
We will read what Evans was most interested in excavating and the effect it had on archeology in the 20th century.
Ponderous, man, ponderous.
George is a fine educator, Curtis.
Sorry, but when you've had these experiences firsthand, it's a little hard to get excited about reading a book.
But I suppose reading is a lot safer than actually doing something.
I feel as though this gentleman may require our attention.
Perhaps a lesson in humility.
Something big.
Something spectacular.
But let's not get caught like all the other times, okay?
Okay.
Shawnie, of all the plans we've concocted, this is the best one.
And we have concocted some doozies.
And Feeny always caught us.
Yeah, he always had us figured out.
But we're in college now.
We're older, we're wiser.
You think he's up to the challenge?
It's us against him, living on the edge, babe.
I like when you call me babe.
All right.
So, Eric said this guy Curtis stored all the stuff from his last dig here in the science lab.
Yeah, he's supposedly got something that's gonna alter the course of the new millennium.
Are we ready to execute phase one of our master plan?
Ready.
Let's mess this place up.
You know, Shawnie, I honestly don't see how anything could be simpler.
This is child's play.
What's this, a brain?
That's gotta be his discovery.
He's discovered the world's first brain.
This gets out, Feeny'll never get the dean.
You could get any woman with the world's first brain.
Could I get Topanga?
Yeah, I think you could.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa, whoa, hey.
That jar's been closed for 5,000 years.
You know, this must be the world's first jar.
How do I get this thing open?
Well, here, here.
Hand me the rare Phoenician mallet.
No, no, no, no, that's an early Egyptian dental tool.
There we go.
Phoenician piece of crap.
Shawn, you broke it.
That's not part of the plan.
I'll replace it.
I see them all the time at Bed, Bath and Phoenician.
Here, hand me the Byzantine statue of King Hafaratu.
Home Shopping Channel.
There's six billion of them left.
Wow, the human brain.
The thing that separates us from the animals.
'Cause they would have an animal brain.
Yeah.
I hold in my hands the pinnacle of God's creation.
Think fast!
You want personality or motor skills?
Energy can be emitted or absorbed by matter, but only in small, discreet units called quanta.
Feeny, stop hiding behind your books!
Also fundamental to the development of quantum physics was the uncertainty principle.
Oh, Feeny, you're in pain.
Eric, you're not even in this class.
But someone who is perfectly fine does not let some world-famous super-duper explorer guy who's five times the man you'll ever be, swoop in and take your booty.
She is not my booty!
And if she was my booty, I would prefer not to talk about my booty in front of the entire class.
Look, come on, Feeny.
Everybody knows.
No one knows.
I have behaved in a manner befitting a man of my station.
Word salad, Feeny.
Okay, who here knows who Feeny loves?
The dean!
All right, everybody out.
We're just rooting for you, Mr. Feeny.
Why won't you make your move?
Eric, in a world that is not run by savages, there is such a thing as decorum.
Now, decorum would suggest that a gentleman allow a lady to resolve an old relationship before he engages her in a new one.
Yes, but, see, you're already in a new relationship!
You're in a triangle, Feeny, and take it from somebody who's been in a triangle before, he who hesitates is lost.
Rachel!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm fine.
I'm just like you.
Oh, dear, I don't want to be like you.
Cory, look what you did.
You had a perfectly good world's first brain, and now look at it.
I'm sorry.
Well, well, here.
Just, like, smoosh it back together and put it back in the jar.
I will.
You know what, I better hide this because Uh-oh.
Oh, you broke another jar.
Wonder what was in that one?
Whoa!
Whoa.
That is one angry bee.
All right, forget the bee.
On to phase two.
Yeah.
How about we open a window for some air?
Wait a minute, Shawn, won't opening a window set off an alarm?
Oh, man.
We never learn anything, do we?
No, and now the teacher from next door's gonna hear that alarm.
And he's gonna come in here all mad.
And I wonder who that teacher's gonna be?
Oh, no.
It's Feeny.
What's going on in here?
Nothing.
We didn't break this stuff.
Well, who did?
You did!
And we're telling!
Hey!
Hmm!
Come on out, Jack.
I wanna see how good you look.
How ya doing?
Okay, something's different.
Yeah, and we're going out.
Let's go.
Hey, hey.
Oh, wait a second.
You're tall.
Yeah.
So are you.
Let's go.
No, I mean, I'm looking straight ahead, and suddenly you're in my field of vision.
What did you do?
Well, I'm standing up straight.
You know me, I'm a schlump.
I'm a real, uh, down-looker.
Well, let's go.
Hey, hey.
What is on your feet?
My dancing shoes.
Oh, I can't believe this.
Jack, you bought elevator shoes.
They're not elevator shoes.
The guy never called them elevator shoes.
Oh, what did he call them?
"Manly step-ups.
" Oh, Jack!
What?
I can't believe this.
That's why you didn't want to go out with me, because you're too embarrassed to be seen with me 'cause I'm so tall.
What are you talking about?
My whole life I've been the tall one, the bean pole.
I never thought that.
"Hey, stilts, how's the weather up there"?
You know, you're crazy.
You know why I didn't want to go out with you?
'Cause I thought they'd say, "Hey, look at the model with that shrimp.
" What are you talking about?
You've never been worried about this before when we've been out.
Yeah, but we've only been out as friends.
I never really thought about this until we got together.
You know what, to be honest, I never thought you'd be interested in me.
Well, I am interested in you, Jack, but not in those.
You know what?
I would love to go dancing.
Really?
You mean, in front of everybody?
Yes, in front of the whole world.
All right, let's dance.
Oh, Jack.
Come on.
Okay.
How you doing?
She's too tall for you.
George!
What?
This?
I didn't do this.
I didn't believe them when they told me, but it's hard to argue with something that's right in front of your face.
Yeah, we're just as shocked as you are, Dean.
Now, look, this is insane.
Put the brain down!
What in heaven's name were you thinking of when you did this?
I didn't do it!
They did it!
Oh!
Mr. Feeny, we are insulted.
Shawn and I have been upstairs selling muffins for the underprivileged.
They were down here with me.
Topanga, you wouldn't lie for him.
Where was he?
He's been selling muffins all day.
So was Shawn.
We're legitimate now.
Why did you do this, George?
Uh, you know something, Dean, this was simply just an act of love culminating in an act of vandalism.
It actually happens all the time.
An act of love?
Was this an act of love, George?
Yeah.
Yep.
All right, nobody move.
Where's my bee?
Bee?
What bee?
My bee, it's my discovery.
Uh-oh.
It's an African killer bee.
I've been searching for it for years.
Curtis, you've been out of town a little too long.
Those African killer bees are swarming all over the country.
They're due in Philly next Tuesday.
This bee has a reverse migration pattern.
We mate that species with the killer bees that are already here, they start migrating back where they originated from, saving thousands of lives.
I could be rich!
It's the bee!
Everybody relax!
I'll kill it.
No!
Don't touch that bee.
Oh, Curtis, no.
The statue of King Hafaratu you gave me for our anniversary, it's broken.
The hell with the statue.
This stuff is nothing but junk compared to that bee.
This is junk?
Shh!
Don't move.
The bee's on you.
Oh, Curtis, you know I'm allergic to bees.
So you puff up for a little while.
This is my Nobel Prize.
I don't think so, Curtis.
Ooh!
Ow!
I think this belongs to you.
I'll return the stinger as soon as it works its way out of my flesh.
No, no, no, no.
Don't die.
Don't die!
Quick!
Where's the zoology department?
Oh, God!
Ha!
That guy's a dope, man.
George, that's the most wonderful thing anybody's ever done for me.
I wouldn't let anything harm you, Lila.
I hope you feel the same way about me.
What took you so long, George?
Kiss her, Feeny.
All right.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Now, this is a beautiful moment.
What's even more beautiful, it's the first time we've ever gotten away with anything in our lives.
We've washed How did this blow up in our face?
I don't know.
We had Feeny scammed.
Yeah, Feeny was nothing, but his chick is tough.
Ouch.
Ooh.
Oh, does it still hurt?
A little.
You want me to Oh, please.
All better.
I want to thank you again for going easy on the boys.
Oh.
George, one of the reasons I was attracted to you was because I've never seen a teacher whose students were willing to go to such lengths to see him happy.
You never actually thought I was the perpetrator?
Oh, I have no doubt that you're capable of acting with reckless abandon.
Oh, I am, I am.
Hey!
Well, this is great, isn't it?
I mean, you love him, he loves you, I love you both.
We're a triangle.
Now, um, Dean, there's something you should know.
Feeny and I like to hang out quite a bit, so, if I'm ever around and you guys are getting frisky, or whatever it is that you guys do, I'm gonna need some kind of a signal to know that it's my time This'll work.
I don't know what I was thinking.
We are perfect for each other.
Perfect.
Hi, Mrs. Bertelson.
She's too tall for you.
Jack, stop, stop!
Okay, okay, okay.
Jack, look, look, look, look, look.
You said you weren't gonna let this bother you, okay?
It's no problem.
I'm okay.
Okay, great.
I hope the cable breaks, Mrs. Bertelson!
Jack, why don't we go inside and make us snuggly.
Yes.
I'm not too short for that.
I know.
Hey.
Hey!
Come any closer and I'll club ya.
She's too tall for you.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Cory, the banquet halls are filling up.
Will you please look at these dates?
No, I'm wet and naked.
Me, too.
You're not naked.
Cory, I can't pick out a wedding dress or flowers or anything until we set a date.
Will I ever see you naked?
Someday.
Sunday?
Pick a date!
How about your tushie right now as a sign of good faith?
Ha!
Nice try, babe.
Ooh, nice tush.
Ooh, hubba, hubba.
I'm just a piece of meat to you, aren't I?
All men are.
Isn't that right, my little rump roast?
Angela, what'd you do that for?
Because I did.
Oh.
Cory, here, I borrowed your razor.
You used my razor?
Yeah.
Just to shave my legs.
You don't mind, do you?
Mind?
That the razor I use on my face was used to shave your wonderful leg only brings us much closer and increases my overall joy.
Good.
Please remember to look at those dates.
I will, my smooth one.
I'm gonna be sick.
What?
She used my What's the big deal?
Why don't you just change the blade, you baby?
I think it's sexy.
I do, too.
Her stubble on my face is sexy to you?
Cory's disgusted you used his razor.
Are you kidding me?
Why wouldn't you have just said something?
Ha, ha, I don't mind.
I think that you using my razor is very sexy.
Oh, good.
So, if I were to use this razor right now to shave under my arms, you'd be okay with that?
Sure.
No, I'd hate it!
I hate it!
Please don't!
Why wouldn't you have just told me the truth?
The truth?
That's funny, the truth.
Cory, if we're gonna be married, we have to be able to be totally honest with each other.
We should learn from this.
From right now, total honesty.
It's a trap.
Wait a minute Are you saying I can tell you the truth about everything?
Trap, trappity, trap, trap I want you to.
Trap.
Trap.
Are you saying I can tell you exactly what I think with no fear of repercussion or lots and lots of yelling?
Try it.
Well, okay.
Topanga If you don't mind, would you please consider keeping your paws off my razor?
Done.
Really?
Wow.
Honesty all the time.
This will be good, huh?
Yeah, this will be real good.
Oh, look My Petite Shoe is playing at the university theater.
Do you want to go?
Watch this.
No.
I don't wanna go.
You know why?
Because it's a chick flick.
And Cory don't like chick flicks.
You know what else I don't like?
The Ice Capades.
Don't ever take me there.
So, how am I doing?
You're right on schedule.
Hey, guys.
How you doing?
Hey, Eric.
What's Josh doing here?
Oh, I'm just baby-sitting.
I'm waiting for Mom and Dad to come pick him up.
Hey, little bro.
Oh, Eric, wait, wait.
We wanna catch everybody here.
Oh, hi, Joshua.
Well, Jack and I are having our first dinner party on Friday night, and we wanted to invite you all, 'cause I'm gonna cook, and it's gonna be really, really fun.
Sure.
Cory, you wanna go?
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Eric, we really want you to come.
Well, how do you expect me to go back to the place where I had my heart ripped out of my chest and thrown around the room like it was a Like a nerf heart.
I want you to forget about everything that's happened between us and remember that we're friends, and I want you to come to our party because it's for friends.
Will you be making tater tots?
Oh, I'll make tater tots.
Oh, well, then I'll be there.
I'm so in love with her.
Oh, Josh, you're getting cold, buddy.
Aw, who's the little one?
That's Joshua.
He's so cute.
How old is he?
Months or something, I don't know.
Uh, look at me, though.
I'm Eric.
You know, there's nothing sweeter than a father with his new baby.
Oh, sure there is, the father, his new baby, and his new baby's girlfriend.
What about your wife?
Dead.
What are you doing later?
No, I'm all that he's got in this world.
Hey, Eric.
Mom and Dad!
Hey, all right, great.
Cup of coffee?
Come on.
Hey, little boy.
Did you miss your mommy?
Did I miss my mommy?
Of course I missed my mommy.
Come here.
And I missed my daddy, too, didn't I, big guy?
All right.
Back off.
Have you met my new friend?
This is, um Dana.
Dana.
Hello.
Hi, Dana.
You have an adorable grandson.
What?
Oh, uh, yes, yes, we do.
Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Alan, he's using our child to pick up women.
It's disgusting.
I'm going to have a talk with him.
See what I made there?
What you doing?
Carving rose radishes.
I just spent a half an hour on the one in your mouth.
It's good.
Oh, you weren't planning on wearing that, were you?
What, don't I look good in this?
Oh, no, you look fine.
You look fine.
I just thought maybe since this is our first dinner party together, you might, I don't know, want to dress up a little bit.
Got anything in particular you want me to wear?
Oh, no, I want you to wear whatever you want to wear.
Except this.
You're so funny.
I'm gonna go think about things.
Topanga At what point when you were paying to have this done to your hair did you look in the mirror and say, "Hey, this looks good"?
Cory, you've made your point.
You don't like my hair.
Watch this.
Topanga, if I may be honest, and you said I could, I don't dislike your hair.
No, no.
I hate it.
No, hate's too strong of a word.
Uh No, hate's good.
I think whoever did this to you should be taken outside, tied down, and made to look at it.
He's like a dog with a bone.
Hi.
Come on in.
Oh, Topanga, I love your hair.
Thank you.
I don't.
Don't worry, we have an honesty pact.
We tell each other the truth about everything now.
Yeah, nothing bad's gonna happen at all.
You know what?
This reminds me of this game we used to play back in high school.
Oh, what kind of game?
Oh, it was an honesty game.
Oh, well, how do you play?
We put everybody's name in a hat, and whoever's name you draw, you can ask whatever you want.
I just came to eat.
That's a nice outfit.
Are you afraid of honesty, Shawn?
Oh, yeah, in a big way.
Cory and I aren't.
Honesty's a cinch for us.
Trap.
Well, great, then.
I'll get the hat.
Put it on Topanga.
I'm done.
Okay, everybody.
Let's play.
Oh, do we have to play a game?
Oh, come on.
Dinner's not quite ready, and we have to wait for Eric anyway.
It's really fun to think of intimate questions that'll really embarrass everybody.
Okay, well, I'll go first.
Jack.
Oh, great.
Okay, if you could change one thing about Rachel, what would you change?
Oh, that's good.
I don't know.
Who's next?
Oh, come on, Jack.
Try.
I mean, there must be something about me that bothers you.
Nope, sorry.
Ooh, great game.
Feels good to be honest, huh?
Ooh.
All right.
Rachel.
Yes.
Same question.
Is there anything about Jack that bothers you?
See how hard it is?
He's too passive and needs to voice his opinions more.
Jack, what do you think about that?
I don't know.
Eric, hi You brought a guest.
Yeah, yeah.
This is Dana.
I met her at the student union when I was with my son, Joshua.
He's with Grandma and Grandpa Matthews right now.
You remember my son, Joshua.
And the honesty game just got a little more interesting.
Do you think I'm too passive?
What?
Nothing.
Well, Dana, hi.
I'm Rachel.
It's nice to meet you.
Would you excuse me for just one second?
Funny hair.
What?
What's the matter?
I have seven Cornish hens, seven baked potatoes, and seven parfaits, and there are eight people here.
Ah.
Okay, I'll leave.
Sit down.
So, Eric, we're playing a truth game to promote honesty in relationships.
Honesty.
Excellent, excellent.
It's what they teach us in law school.
All right.
Let's see who's next.
Shawn If you could spend one night with anyone, no strings attached, who would it be with?
Anyone in the world?
No strings?
Yep.
Be honest.
Then I'd pick Angela.
Angela?
So, with no strings, no commitment, no emotional attachment, you'd pick me?
Yeah.
What do you say to that?
Let's do it.
It's a trap.
So, come on, Shawn.
Let's go.
Now?
Now.
I like this game.
Hello.
What?
When you two broke up, who is the one that spent every minute of every day trying to get you two back together?
You, darling.
And who was the one who spent every second trying to make you two realize that you belong together?
You, darling.
Then why are you going to do something very strange in the bedroom when I have absolutely nothing to do with it?
No strings, Cory.
I don't get it.
Bye-bye.
So, uh, Dana What's your feeling about this whole stringless relationship?
You know, no commitments, no emotional attachment, still you get to honk-honk, you know what I'm saying?
And I want you to remember, everybody's being honest tonight.
Well, I just met you.
Mmm-hmm.
All I know about you is that you're a single father working his way through law school who just got back from the no-fly zone in Iraq.
Aw, she goes out with you, she deserves what she gets.
That's right, baby.
Okay, let's get back to the game.
Who's next?
I'm not passive.
I'm just nice.
Excuse me.
But does anybody care about what's going on up there?
I have something to say.
These are not tater tots!
Eric, they're right here.
You leave hair in the shower!
You leave hair.
It bothers me.
That's right.
Your hair, in the shower, clogging up the drain.
It bothers me.
Yeah, you.
Wait a second, you've been sitting there and stewing for 20 minutes, and that's all that you came up with?
Leave me alone.
You all know what they're doing up there, don't you?
They're Cory.
If you could change one thing about Topanga, what would it be?
Um What would it be?
What would it be?
What would it be?
Cory, make your we're-gonna-be-virgins- for-the-rest-of-our-lives joke, and then we can all move on.
I'd actually change your need to be perfect all the time.
What?
Yeah, I think you need to relax, lighten up a bit.
Jeez, they've been up there a long time.
I don't need to be perfect.
Oh, come on, Topanga, from nursery school to college, you always had to be the best at everything.
Really?
Then why didn't I go to Yale, Cory?
Why am I here at Pennbrook with you?
What?
Okay.
Game's over.
Who's hungry for hen?
I knew it.
You resent the fact that you gave up Yale for me.
I gave up Yale for us.
I was just trying to show you you were wrong, okay?
Well, maybe you should have gone, then.
Yeah, maybe the time apart would have been good for us.
In what way?
Maybe we wouldn't be engaged?
Why do you have to take it to that level?
Rachel?
Huh?
Thank you for everything.
I'm gonna be leaving now.
No, no, uh Wait a minute, you started this whole honesty thing.
You can't leave.
Watch me.
Topanga I can't believe they're still up there.
Oh, Jack, I just wanted to have my first grown-up dinner party with my Cornish hens And tater tots!
My party's sucky.
No, come on, it's just your first one.
Next time, we won't invite these people.
Well, I guess we could invite some of them.
I mean, Eric seems to be doing pretty well with his date.
I love Shamu.
How do you train him to do all those tricks?
It's hard.
It's a difficult task, but the key is to start small, uh, sit, stay Eat Pinocchio.
You know what, everything was going fine until I thought of that stupid honesty game.
No, no, that's not true, honey.
This party would have been bad no matter what happened.
That's very honest of you.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh.
This is the greatest night of my life.
Don't talk.
No one understands this but us.
Quiet.
I forgot how well we fit together.
I'm asking you to shut up.
What do you want from me?
I want to understand what's bothering you.
I thought you wanted to spend some time apart, Cory.
Topanga, that's not what I meant, and you know it.
But there is a part of you that wonders what it'd be like to spend a year apart?
Honesty?
Please.
Yes, there's a part of me that wonders what it would be like.
But there's another part, a much bigger part, that knows I would have been miserable without you.
Now, I need to know, are you sorry you gave up Yale?
Honesty?
Please.
Giving up Yale was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
But, of course, I would have been miserable without you, too.
I just want to be able to use your razor.
I already told you I don't want you to react like that.
So, that's what this is about, isn't it?
Cory, the relationship that I want is not two individuals who live under the same roof.
I want us together, Cory.
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine.
If you're gonna react like that over a razor, how are you gonna react when I use your toothbrush?
Not well.
Angela Mmm, don't.
Miss you.
Don't.
I can't help it.
Don't.
Angela, I love you.
Ow!
My keys.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Oh, man, I Cory'd this up, didn't I?
You had to go and get heavy, Shawn, didn't you?
No, I'm not getting heavy, Angela.
I just think that an emotional commitment is a proper foundation for Oh, my God, I'm both of them!
Topanga, if we're really being honest, then I think what you need is some imaginary perfect relationship.
You know, this is just you going after perfect again.
No, Cory, this is me realizing that we are going to be sharing the rest of our lives together and wondering why you can't even share a razor or a toothbrush.
Okay, you want real honesty, Topanga?
Can you handle real honesty?
I just want to know what it's gonna take to share your toothbrush.
The truth is I could never share any of my personal items with someone who won't even show me her tushie.
No tushie, no brushy.
I think that's fair.
I What?
Thank you, Rachel.
I had a really nice time.
You're welcome.
Come back soon.
I have seen the promised land!
I showed him my butt.
You two make my life a living hell.
Great, great party, Rachel.
We're having a great time.
Really?
Wow, I thought that whole honesty game might have ruined the evening.
Ah, on the contrary, honesty is the only way to go for a healthy relationship.
If you'll notice, only the honest couples are left here.
Yeah, the bullet hurt.
But I saved the President's life, so I think it was worth it.
Eric doesn't count.
And I'm Batman.
What are you doing?
Oh, I left mine in my gym bag.
You know, this sharing stuff is great.
Thanks.
There's a hair on it.
Oh, yeah.
Look, it's one of my boys.
I can tell 'cause it's kinky, like me.
Here you go.
You are a disgusting little man.
Yes, I am.
Hey, Shawn, why are you following me?
You had your chance, babe.
I'm not following you.
I couldn't care less about you.
You mean nothing to me.
Less than nothing.
Nothing.
Not a thing.
Okay.
Good for you.
Cold shower now!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
You know, I just want to thank you both for convincing Eric to move back in with us.
You know, it's really great to have you back, buddy.
Well, you know something?
I'm happy to be back.
Nice kiss.
Thank you, Jack.
You see, Shawn, all it took was you and me to get them to settle their differences.
Cory and Shawn forever.
Best friends.
Best friends forever.
Cory, why are you looking at me like that?
Cory, what Cory!
Cory.
Shawn.
Don't tell me.
Is it the puppet nightmare again?
Yeah, it was the puppet nightmare.
He was chasing me on foot.
He had a gun.
Wow.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Well, good.
Let's get some sleep.
I got that speech for Feeny tomorrow.
I've got to be fresh if I'm gonna fake it.
Okay.
Good night, Cor.
Nighty-night, Shawn.
Shawn?
Yeah, Cor?
You're my best friend.
Thanks, Cor.
Now, watch closely as I slowly pour the milk into the hat.
Mr. Hunter, your speech is on Louis Pasteur.
I don't see what that has to do with making milk disappear.
This has everything to do with Lou.
Trust me.
Now, does anyone in the audience happen to have a piece of magic rope?
Look at that.
Mr. Matthews.
Why don't you come down here?
I hate teaching.
May I please have that magic rope?
Yes, you may.
Now, what a lot of people don't know about Lou That little curly-headed boyfriend of yours is driving me insane.
Is he still having nightmares?
No, no, no.
Not anymore.
He hasn't slept in three days.
I turn off the lights and I hear him moving around in the dark like a rat.
I wake up the next morning, the closets are reorganized, my shorts are ironed, and my hair's been moussed.
Oh, my poor Cory.
Hot coffee coming through.
Hey, thanks, Cor.
These are mine.
Get your own.
Cory, drinking coffee to avoid your nightmares is not the solution.
Who said I was having nightmares?
I did, you loony!
Why would you say I was having night Oh, I'm not mad at you.
Not you.
Not Shawnie Shawn.
Hey, how's the mousse holding up, huh?
It looks good.
Yes, it does.
Eric Mmm, Xena, my warrior princess.
Eric!
Aw, you're not my warrior princess, you're my mommy.
Honey, you sleeping on the couch is just not working out.
And whose fault is that?
Turning my room into a nursery for him.
You know something, Morgan, you've got a big room.
Wouldn't it be fun if No.
But, but No.
Are you sure you don't want No.
Hey, Cory, Cory, Cory, wait.
You know, we've got an hour before class.
Why don't you take a nap?
I don't need a nap, I need to paint a house.
I'll race you to the door.
I win, I win.
Eric?
What are you doing here?
I've decided to live with you guys.
You know, I just think it'd be so great, you know, I have this great brother and brother's friend, and I think the three of us together, we really would be Hello, roomie!
Roomie?
Oh, Jack, look.
It's a homeless man.
Oh, how sad.
Yeah, the poor guy.
Eric?
Morning.
Eric, get up right now.
You are coming back home with us.
This is ridiculous.
No, I don't want your pity.
Oh, come on, man.
You can have your old room back.
You haven't rented it out yet?
No.
Really?
No.
We've been hoping you'd come back home.
Right, hon?
"Hon"?
"Hon"?
Is that what I'm gonna be hearing 24 hours a week?
Huh?
Oh, come on, Eric.
Oh, I get it.
I'm Eric, but you're "hon.
" Looking for a roommate!
Eric, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm being a man.
I am standing on my own two feet.
I'm gonna hold on to a little bit of my dignity.
Please!
Someone take pity upon my wretched soul!
I'm looking for a roommate.
Hey, I was looking first.
No, I mean, I have an apartment.
I'm looking for someone to share it.
Oh, hey, good luck to you, then.
Looking for a roommate!
All right, now, let's continue our discussion of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.
Mr. Matthews!
Mr. Matthews!
Mr. Matthews, I would appreciate it if you would stay conscious during my class.
I'm conscious.
Wonderful.
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes.
"To sleep, perchance to dream, "ay, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of death " Shawn.
Shawn, you can't let me go to sleep.
Shawn?
Great.
That's right.
Scurry off to your mundane little lives.
Mr. Matthews, you are acting very odd.
I've been having dreams, Mr. Feeny.
Dreams about killing someone very close to me.
Mr. Hunter.
Yes, yes!
How did you know?
You are brilliant.
It's been killing me, I haven't been able to sleep.
There's nothing to worry about, Cory.
Killing your best friend is a common theme in dreams.
It's perfectly normal.
Well, how normal?
Because, you see, I have this one dream where I push Shawn Down an empty elevator shaft.
Yes!
The elevator shaft represents the ups and downs of your friendship with Mr. Hunter.
Ups and downs.
Mmm-hmm.
That's interesting.
You see, Mr. Hunter, in his search for peace and harmony in his life, causes you pain.
How?
By putting an incredible amount of pressure on you to help him in his search.
Annoying, isn't it?
So, how do I stop these dreams?
You forgive him.
Forgiveness, of course.
He hurt you, and now you're hurting him back.
Forgive and the dreams will stop.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Anytime, Mr. Matthews, anytime.
Well, what's that?
Hey, you know how I didn't get you a birthday present last year?
Well, here you go.
Shawn, I have to tell you something.
Tell me after you open the present.
Well, okay.
Wow, my own personalized baseball bat.
Too cool.
Die, Shawn, die!
You have to let me explain.
Explain what?
My best friend screams he wants to kill me in front of the whole class.
What's to explain?
Well, I lied about the puppet dream.
No kidding.
These are not good dreams I'm having, Shawn.
I kill you in every one of them.
I kill you good.
Like how?
Well, I fed you thumbtack soup.
I poured hot lava down your pants.
I pulled your heart out with salad tongs.
I set fire to your tie.
I shredded you over pasta with a cheese grater.
I dressed you up like a rooster and entered you in a cockfight.
Hmmm.
How'd I do?
Well, you won!
But the crowd cried "fix," and it got ugly.
I'm sorry, Shawn.
They're dreams.
Get some sleep.
Well, you know, I think there may be a solution.
In my last dream, Feeny was there.
He told me all I had to do to stop these dreams was to forgive you.
Forgive me for what?
Well, I don't think that's important.
What's important is I forgive you, Shawn, okay?
You're forgiven, 100% forgiven, forgiven, forgiven.
And now I'm all better.
So, you're going to sleep tonight?
Oh, yeah.
Thanks to Mr. Feeny, I'm finally gonna get a good night's sleep and go back to my normal dream.
The one where you win the Miss Costa Rica pageant?
I wish peace for all the little ninos.
Dude!
Look at this place.
Oh, there is just no way that I can afford this.
Pay whatever you can.
It gets a little lonely around here.
I just can't seem to keep a roommate.
What?
You can't keep a roommate in a place like this?
Oh, wait a second, I know.
Bad neighbors.
Come in.
Oh, hey, Sheila.
Hi, Adam.
This package came for you today.
I signed for it.
Who's the cutie?
Eric Matthews, Sheila Shagher.
Oh, behave.
She lives next door.
Eric's my new roommate.
Well, I'll have to come around more often to borrow a cup of sugar.
Why stop at a cup?
Well, I have to run, but it was nice meeting you.
You, too.
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!
How is it you have any trouble at all keeping a roommate?
Beats me.
Not again.
It was raining.
You had a new umbrella.
You let me take a look at it.
And then, I shoved it down your throat, and I opened it.
You opened it?
Oh, Shawn, I Mary Poppined you.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Cory, it's the middle of the night.
Where are you going?
You gave me bad advice, Feeny.
What do you mean?
You were in my dream, Mr. Feeny, and you gave me advice that sucked.
I'm not responsible for dream Feeny.
Why don't you start from the beginning?
Every time I fall asleep, I dream that I kill Shawn.
Now, what kind of person am I that would want my best friend dead?
Well, now, you know you don't want Shawn dead.
Oh, how do you know who I want dead?
Cory, you mustn't take dreams literally.
They can be interpreted in many ways.
Why am I killing Shawn?
I really don't know.
You know, Freud says that, uh, dreams come from our unconscious.
Repressed thoughts that have to be confronted.
But in the dream state, they're not quite clear.
It's quite clear I'm killing Shawn.
You're dreaming about it for a reason.
What's the reason?
Well, you wake up every time screaming?
Yeah.
After you kill Shawn?
Well, actually, I've never seen him die, but, I mean, I did some pretty bad stuff to him, Mr. Feeny.
He didn't stand a chance.
Oh, so you always woke up before you actually killed him?
Yeah, but I You're right.
I've never finished the dream.
That's the key, Mr. Matthews.
Perhaps if you finish the dream, you'll find out what it means.
Dude, that whole bedroom's for me?
It's bigger than my parents' house.
What are you watching?
Weather channel.
Want to join me?
Sure.
Whoa!
Not there.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
My mother's chair.
Oh, sorry.
She coming over?
No, she's dead.
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Thank you.
I love her very much.
I'll just go crash over there.
Eric, will you get that, please?
Yeah.
Hello?
Eric, it's me, Adam.
You can't sit there, either.
Dude, what are you doing?
Eric, I'm on the phone.
Eric?
Yes, Adam?
That's where Uncle Dave died.
It's time to feed the bird.
We have a bird?
How come I haven't seen this bird?
Want to help me feed her?
Yeah, man.
I love birds.
All kinds of birds?
Every one of them.
Okay.
Where's the birdie?
Where's the pretty birdie?
Where's the pretty bir Her name's Nellie.
I've had her since I was two.
She's the best bird ever.
She normally doesn't like people, but look at her!
She sure likes you.
Polly want a cracker?
Polly want an autopsy!
That's a dead bird!
Not to me.
That is just sick and weird.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you, talking in front of her like that?
Sorry, Nellie.
It's not your fault, Adam.
All right, all right, that's it, that's it.
I'm out of here.
And it is so his fault.
Great.
Leave!
Everybody leaves me.
I wonder why!
I thought you were different.
You're just like everybody else.
Nobody cares about me, nobody wants me.
Forever alone.
I hate the silence.
I know how you feel.
No, you don't.
Yeah, I really do.
I was kicked out by my family, betrayed by my closest friends, thrown out into this crazy world all by myself.
Nowhere to go, nowhere to live, alone.
So, you'll stay?
No.
Hi, Eric.
I did it again, locked myself out after taking a shower.
At least this time I remembered the towel.
Mind if I hang with you guys till my roommate comes back?
Maybe I'll stay.
Adam, he's gonna stay.
Hello, hello!
You see, Shawn, all it took was you and me to get them to settle their differences.
Cory and Shawn forever.
Best friends.
Best friends forever.
Cory, why are you looking at me like that?
Cory, what Cory!
You have to go.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Cory, what are you doing?
Shoving everyone down the elevator shaft.
Guess who's next?
Rachel!
Rachel Angela, come on.
Everybody's doing it.
Doing what?
This.
Hi, Cory.
Lauren?
What are you doing here?
I'm over you.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm not Lauren.
Then who are you?
I'm everything you're giving up.
The girls you'll never get to meet.
The places you'll never get to go.
The life you'll never have.
I don't understand.
Bye, Cory.
Wait!
Cory?
Topanga?
Where is everybody?
I killed them.
For us.
I know.
I miss them.
I miss them, too.
You can wake up now.
Cory?
Cory, wake up.
You've been sleeping all night.
Morning, sunshine.
Hey.
Did you dream?
Yeah.
What did you dream about?
I dreamed about you.
Oh, good.
So, you're okay now?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Bye.
You're not okay, are you?
Do you think I'm rushing into marriage?
You've been rushing into marriage since you were two years old.
I mean, nothing's gonna change between you and me, is it?
Is that what you've been dreaming about?
No, I'm just I guess I'm afraid that after I get married everything's gonna change.
Well, yeah, it will.
It has to.
I don't want it to.
Okay, Nellie.
Okay, beg.
Okay, now roll over.
Okay.
Hey, play dead, play dead.
Okay!
Good bird, good bird!
Hello?
Eric, it's me, Adam.
Hey, man, what's up?
I just think it's great how you and Nellie have been getting along so well.
Yeah, well, I love poultry.
Anyway, I mean, you and I have been getting along so well that Excuse me.
Oh, sorry.
That I think it's time you finally met my mom.
Your mom?
But, dude, I thought that your mother was Mom, I want you to meet my new roommate.
Is he a good boy?
He's a very good boy.
I'm glad, 'cause your last roommate was a very, very bad boy.
That's why I took care of him for you, Mom.
What?
You don't say hello to your grandpa?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Cory, Mr. Rutherford called from the banquet hall.
Somebody canceled, and now there's an open date.
How would you like to get married on July 4th, Independence Day?
Married on Independence Day?
How ironic.
You're not getting cold feet about this, are you?
Topanga, you know those terrible dreams I've been having?
Yeah.
Well, they're, don't get mad, about marriage.
They're, don't get mad, anti-marriage dreams.
You, don't get mad, you don't come out so well.
Why not?
Well, last night, for example, I had this dream that you and I, we got married, and we wound up in the poor house.
You know how I know?
Big, big sign on the front, "The poor house.
" And inside, it sounded like people were being beaten, and there was this execution room called the Topanga Room, and the executioner was you!
And all the chopped-off heads in the head basket were me!
Are we getting married or not?
Yeah, I'm just talking.
But how are you so sure about this?
Because I look at our parents, Cory.
I mean, they got married when they were young, and they love each other more now than they ever did.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I mean, my parents are still having babies.
Oh, by the way, my parents are coming into town to discuss the wedding.
"Oh, by the way, my parents are coming into town"?
Oh, by the way, captain Titanic, this ship's in two pieces!
I wanna be able to tell them we've set the date.
We have?
Cory, it's okay to be nervous about this.
It's natural.
Hey.
You wanna hear something?
Feeny and I are getting married Sunday.
Are you nervous?
Yes.
We're just planning a simple ceremony at the justice of the peace on Sunday.
Oh, Alan, we should have the wedding here.
Oh, no, no.
That's not necessary.
Oh, come on, George.
Everyone will want to be there.
You can't rob them of that.
Yeah.
I can't imagine anybody being interested in us.
I'm surprised she's interested in us.
Oh, George.
Oh, Lila.
Oh, my.
Oh, boy!
Big trouble!
Cory, Mr. Feeny and Lila are getting married in our living room.
I'm thrilled for you, Feeny.
Now, get out and take your chick with you.
Cory, have you lost your mind?
The in-laws are coming.
We're outta here.
Looking forward to Sunday.
Yes, yes, we all are.
Now, let's go.
You're a good boy.
Big trouble!
Oh, Cory, it's just Topanga's parents.
Well, I'm going in the living room.
They used to be Topanga's parents.
Now they're the in-laws.
Now they hate me.
Why?
The same reason Grandma hates you.
Oh, got it.
And other reasons.
What other reasons?
Yale.
I'm the reason that their daughter is not going to Yale this year.
I'm also the reason that their daughter is not living with them in Pittsburgh.
That is why I made these.
Dos and don'ts for behavior around the in-laws?
What, you didn't think I was actually gonna let you be yourselves for this, did you?
"No impressions, none.
" What?
People love my impressions.
Oh, please.
No one even knows when you're doing one.
Fine.
Hush little baby don't say a word Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird Uh, no she ain't, Ma.
Not tonight.
Ha.
What do you mean, ha?
I mean, ha, you can't sing.
I mean, no, you sing very well.
But not tonight, 'cause it's on the "don't" list like my impressions.
They're here!
Oh, Cory, there's nothing to be nervous about.
Their daughter loves you.
That's what's important.
You're right.
You're right.
That's what's important.
You know what else is important?
That you two stick to the conversational topics that I've clearly written out for you.
"Bridges and patio furniture"?
"Peaches and slipcovers.
" That's it!
Nothing else!
Nobody says anything stupid, okay?
Nothing stupid.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry your daughter gave up Yale for me.
Cory, you remember my parents, Jedediah and Rhiannon.
It's okay, Cory.
She's happy where she is.
Sure, what the hell.
Four generations of Lawrences at Yale are plenty.
Would you like to come in?
Yeah.
I guess.
Hello, Cory.
White ball in the hole right over there.
Eric, you just scratched on purpose.
Yeah, well, I'm a loser anyway.
Hey, do you wanna talk?
What, you and me?
Yeah.
Can we do that?
Why, I mean, I don't know.
We never have before.
No, not in the last six years.
Not even that year we lived together.
I know.
I completely forgot about that year.
When was that?
That was last year.
Oh!
Oh!
So, you want to try talking and see what happens?
What could you and I possibly have to talk about?
Okay.
My life sucks, Shawnie.
I lost my apartment My apartment!
I lost Rachel Rachel!
I lost my best friend Jack.
Rachel!
And now I'm about to lose Feeny to that mean old lady.
Jack!
Well, Eric, I lost something that means more to me than any of that, and I managed to survive.
You mean your dead dad, Shawn?
You're a sensitive guy.
Hey, thanks, man.
I just wish that Rachel could see that.
I mean, I love her.
Let me ask you something.
Do you think the two of you would actually make a good couple?
She's so pretty.
Right.
But what about her attracts you spiritually?
Oh, spiritually.
She's so pretty.
Okay, but what about her personality makes her your ideal woman?
Well, she's pretty, like I said, and she can walk really good, and she's got this You know what?
Why don't you just go ask Jack?
I mean, he's the one who won her.
You know, it sounds to me like you care more about the competition with Jack than you actually care about her.
Oh, well, now, see, that is ridiculous.
I could've won that.
I could.
I swear.
He cheated.
Because Dad died?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, he was grieving.
Chicks totally dig people that are grieving.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I know it was your dad and everything, I really do, but I'm pretty sure it was a fix.
Eric, you know, I feel really good about my life right now.
Because when I took off in my dad's trailer, I had a moment, just one moment, that made everything completely clear for me.
I was looking at the night sky, and I could see everything, the stars, planets, galaxies.
You must've felt so small.
I did.
I totally did.
I felt like a speck who was here for one moment in time and then gone.
And I decided that while I'm here, I wanna be with my friends and the people I love.
Because when I'm with you guys, I don't feel that small.
That's what I figured out.
But that's for you.
Yeah, that's for me.
So, I guess I got to figure stuff out, too, but for me.
For you.
I'm glad you came back, Shawn.
That's a nice talk.
Yeah, it was.
We should do this again sometime.
Look at them, Cory.
That is one big, happy family.
See, I look at them, and that's how I know we're going to be okay.
That's how.
And my cards are working like a charm.
Yeah, whatever.
Cards?
Cory, what did you do?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, how are you?
What are we talking about?
Television.
Jedediah says there's nothing good on anymore.
Television?
Is television bridges or patio furniture, Dad?
The only good show that was ever on television, and everybody knows this, is ALF.
Oh, what?
Nobody watches ALF, Jedediah.
It's not even on anymore.
Well, that's my point, Rhiannon.
There's nothing good on television.
What's the matter with Yes.
Ally McBeal?
I'll tell you what's wrong with Ally McBeal.
She has no passion for the law.
What?
And she takes issue with her husband's comments on television in front of other people.
She's not even married.
And she never will be.
You remember when ALF was on Johnny Carson?
Oh, no.
Boy, nobody did it like Johnny.
Dad.
Ooh, I did not know that.
Well, that was That was hideous.
Do another one.
I don't really want to now.
Jedediah, I thought his Johnny Carson was absolutely fine.
Hey-o.
You are correct, sir.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Rhiannon, I was just having a little fun with him.
Come on, Dad.
Let's hear your Johnny Carson.
Yeah.
Why is it no matter what I say, you have to take the opposite point of view?
I didn't mean to scold.
I just thought you were being a little rude.
No, I wasn't being rude.
Rude is how you chose to interpret it, honey.
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.
What the hell are you doing?
Let's just drop this for now and talk about it later, okay?
Just drop it.
The trouble with us is we drop something, it doesn't mean it goes away.
Oh, Cor, how about some dessert?
How about a little, uh, dessert?
I think that sounds like a great idea, because, uh, Cory and I have an announcement to make.
Honey, I wanna hear your announcement.
I really do.
But I've gotta take a walk for a few minutes, get a little air.
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Mom?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You just couldn't stick to the cards, could ya?
Mom, what's wrong?
It's nothing, Topanga.
I'm emotional.
My little girl is getting married.
What's wrong with Dad?
Oh, Daddy and I have been together a long time.
I know.
That's what I keep telling Cory.
He really wants me to reassure him that our relationship is going to last forever.
All I have to do is tell him about you guys.
Topanga Every relationship lives on its own.
What you each bring to it is what sustains it.
You don't need to look at any other relationship as an example.
You're right.
It's going to be really hard for me and Cory to live up to you guys, but we're gonna try.
Sorry I walked out like that.
It was a long drive from Pittsburgh.
I'm a little worn out.
It's okay, Daddy.
Are we ready to go back inside?
We have a wedding to plan.
Yeah.
You get enough air, Jed?
I'm making spaghetti.
You wanna share it like Lady and the Tramp?
Yeah.
I'll be Tramp.
Unless, uh, you wanna be.
Oh, nuts!
Who is it?
It's Eric.
Um, just a second.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, nothing.
It was just a normal night.
I guess I'm not interrupting anything here.
Oh, no, no.
We were just, uh, reading.
The Bible.
Oh, well, that's good 'cause I actually came here to give you my blessing.
No, I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm not gonna try to make you feel uncomfortable or bad Two straws!
It's okay.
It's okay.
You know, seriously, forget about that.
I just wanted to say that I am genuinely happy for both of you.
Oh, um, isn't that nice.
Why?
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
You are.
You remember how excited we were when she moved in?
Yeah.
You know, maybe this should be just between you guys.
No, no, that's okay.
Listen.
Remember how from the second we saw her, we both wanted her?
Yeah.
I'm gonna leave now, okay?
No, no.
Listen, listen, 'cause here's the thing.
I have been a fool.
What?
This whole time, I've been sitting here thinking I'm so in love with Rachel, but I don't even know her.
What?
Yeah, just living in the same apartment with her, you know, wondering what she's gonna wear every day, or catching a whiff of the smell of her hair, or that cute, funny little laugh she's got.
Oh, you mean like that.
Yeah, our lives really were turned upside down by this one.
Oh, dude, weren't they?
I'm telling you, man.
But you know something, I realized something after I moved out of the apartment.
What?
It was the competition, the competition that was so exciting!
Yeah, it was.
What?
Yeah, yeah, I won that one.
Yeah.
Won what?
Won you.
No, I mean, I didn't "won" you.
I meant I won, you.
Well, anyway, look, I really just came over here to tell you guys how happy I am for you, you know?
It feels so good to finally get it off my chest.
So All right, that's all.
I'm gonna go now.
Hey, it was good seeing you again, man.
Really, it was good seeing ya, all right?
See you, sweetie, all right?
Peace.
How you doing?
Hi.
So, while you guys are here, we want you to come down and see the hall where we want to get married.
It is so beautiful, Mom.
We will, honey.
We never actually had a hall.
We eloped.
You did?
Yeah, her folks didn't think I'd amount to anything, but I guess we showed them, huh, honey?
I guess.
Twenty three years of happiness, brand-new baby, these babies getting married.
Yeah, we showed 'em.
What about you guys?
Did Grandma and Grandpa think you guys would make it?
Yeah, they thought we would make it.
They thought we would be together forever.
Don't.
So did I. Oh, honey.
Mom?
I'm sorry.
Look, Rhiannon, not now.
Mom, why are you crying like this?
You're scaring me.
I thought I could get through this, but I can't.
I'm so sorry.
No, actually, you know what, it's time to feed the baby.
Alan, why don't you come help me feed the baby.
How can I help you feed the Alan.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sure I can help.
Excuse us.
Here, maybe I should go No, no, Cory.
Please, you stay.
If you stay, I don't think Your father and I argue a lot.
That she'd actually say anything in front of you.
All married couples argue a lot.
Topanga, haven't you ever wondered why we let you stay here when we moved to Pittsburgh?
Because of me.
Because you didn't want to take me away from my last year of high school.
And Cory.
Because you didn't want to rip me away from my friends.
Me.
Daddy and I thought we could work things out better if we took some time by ourselves.
Work what out?
There's nobody like you two.
You two are so in love.
Topanga, people change.
Daddy, why is Mom talking like this?
We didn't want to dump this on you.
We wanted to wait until after the wedding.
No.
Honey, look, we tried.
We tried as hard as we You guys will get through this.
Marriage is not something to get through, Topanga!
That's not why I got married.
Oh, God.
No, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm Your daddy and I Maybe we just got married too young.
Jed!
Not you.
This has nothing to do with you.
Now, remember, we are not here as a couple.
I'll sit with you, I may dance with you, but we are not together.
I know.
I know.
You reminded me three times in the car.
Don't worry.
The only feelings I have for you are friendly feelings.
Okay, but it's a wedding.
I don't want you getting all sappy on me.
Oh, come on.
Am I the sappy type?
Oh, Morgan's a flower girl.
Gimme a kiss.
I'm really gonna miss you, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, I'll miss you, too, my boy.
But I'll be back from Aruba in two weeks.
Yeah, I'm, uh, thinking of doing some traveling myself.
Oh, no, don't worry.
I'm not going to Aruba.
I love you, Mr. Feeny.
I love you, too, Eric.
I'll see you when I get back.
Yeah.
I'll see you.
We are gathered here today to join this couple in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate.
George and Lila have chosen to express their love in their own words.
Quietly, I have searched for love for much of my life.
And now that I begin this marriage of our spirits, I realize how incredibly lucky I am to have found it.
My only sadness is that I found you so late in life.
That we've lived our lives spending more days apart than together.
But you've given me your love and friendship, and I promise I'll make up for that lost time.
For marriage is based on those things, but friendship most of all.
Do you, George Feeny, take Lila Bolander as your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold until death do you part?
I do.
And do you, Lila Bolander, take George Feeny as your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold until death do you part?
I do.
With the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Hello.
Oh, hey, Mr. Rutherford.
No, no, no, I'm sorry we haven't gotten back to you yet.
No, I don't think July is going to work.
Yeah, I guess we're still thinking about it.
Yeah.
Okay, thank you.
