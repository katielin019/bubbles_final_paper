{START OF EPISODE 2}
Yes!
Evil waffle-iron, you finally make your match.
Your reign of tyranny has finally Look, jokes.
I mean that's the way I like it.
Breakfast is ready!
Miles, Morgan, Roxie!
Breakfast!
C'mon, people.
Free food.
Fine, have it your way.
I heard crowing.
Is my mother here?
Feds, illegal search and seizure!
Please help me to hide these films!
Sorry, sorry!
It was just me practising my barrier call.
Look, I've made us a first day of college life doesn't get any better than this breakfast.
Look, old McDonald, it was very hard to make sure my first class doesn't start until 3.
Good day and good night!
That's funny because I totally had you beg for a morning person.
Miles, what are you doing?
I made us waffles, and bacon, and eggs.
Do you have any idea where bacon and eggs come from?
Pigs and chicken butts?
Government subsidized farms.
They fed chemicals and hormones.
It's not natural.
Sorry, Sabrina.
My body is my temple.
So, you're filling it with secret sugar barms?
It's turning milk purple.
Don't let them bother you, Sabrina.
Your enthusiasm for college is exactly what we need around here.
Thank you, Morgan.
At least someone appreciates me.
Put me down for french toast tomorrow.
Put me down for a year, right?
Well, Foghorn, I guess it's just you and me.
Sabrina, The Teenage Witch S05E02 - Double Time You know, as sad as I'm about Sabrina beeing off for college I love having time to feel my life with new meaning.
What do you think about acrylics?
Oh, I like them.
But I'm proud if I'll get some.
Watch the dewclaw.
Too bad Zelda is not coping like I am.
For her, the world begins, middles, and ends with Sabrina.
Sabrina, where've I heard that name?
Oh, yes, Audrey Hepburn.
Wonderful film.
Knowing Zelda, she will be moping around for weeks.
I got it!
I got it!
You are looking at a new Associate Professor of Quantum Physics.
Yeah, she's a wreck cove.
Where are you gonna be teaching?
Adams College.
Adams College?
Ah, this sounds familiar?
Oh, I know!
That's Sabrina's college.
How pathetic is that?
I know it looks like I took this job to be near Sabrina but I've always dreamed of being a teacher.
I'm moving on with my life, Hilda.
And so should you.
Already way ahead of you.
Really?
So, tell me how do you plan to spend your time after the clock shop's gone under.
Oh, please, there aren't many hours in the day.
I'm more productive now that I've ever been.
If you'll excuse me I have to prepare Salem a bath.
Are you insane, woman?
My nails aren't dry.
I can't belive I'm actuall here.
Sabrina Spellman, college student, coed, independent woman in the world.
I feel celebratory will hook coming on me.
Sabrina, you are a very lucky freshman.
You have at your disposal this school's most knowledgeable tour guide.
Well, until she shows up why don't you give me the tour?
Oh, do you know where the Psychology Building is?
No idea.
What about History?
Got me again.
Do you know where anything is on this campus?
I know that a men swim team has lunch on a quiet every afternoon.
But you've got to get there early 'cause you could see it's filled out fast.
Don't know where my classes are but I know where I eat lunch.
I can't tell you how excited we are to have you on our faculty, professor.
Yes, that's what you've been doing for the last 20 minutes.
Aunt Zelda?
Oh, Sabrina?
Will you excuse me, gentlemen.
Ha-ha.
Sorry to interupt your little singles mixer but what's going on here?
Men, you can take the Nobel laureate out of a boy, - but you can't take the boy - No.
I mean what are you doing here?
Please tell, professor is just an exotic nickname you're trying out?
Sabrina, I know how this must look.
Like exactly what it is.
I'm supposed to be embarked on a journey of independent sub discovery but there is no aunt in independence.
There is an aunt.
But that's another story.
Obviously, honey, my new job has nothing to do with you.
Yeah, right here I'm trying to go to college like a regular mortal.
But my other realm aunt thinks I can't handle it on my own.
Well, I've got news for you.
I can and I will.
Sabrina!
And while we are at school we don't know each other.
Is that clear, aunt Zelda?
Very clear.
And it's Professor Spellman to you.
Good.
And it's Sabrina to you.
Hey, congratulations of a new job!
Thanks, I'm really excited.
Gotta get one of those book bags of wheels.
Oh, maybe a pack mule.
What's wrong perky?
First day of Sabrina's wonderful life's hitting a brick wall?
No, not at all.
It's very wonderful.
I've only been in college for 3 hours and already I get to read Maybe, I ought to rethink my definition of the word "wonderful".
Hey, college girl.
How was the big first day?
Bigger than I expected.
But still wonderful.
Josh, this is my roommate, Roxie.
Hi, Roxie.
Great name.
You know I had this girl at school named Roxie.
I used to call her Foxy Roxie.
And today you're wiping tables for living.
I'm shocked.
Nice to meet you too.
Don't mind her.
She's a way a little pranky before She's just cranky.
Sabrina, Emerson's having a huge kick-off party tonight.
They've party on Monday night?
This is college.
They've parties every night.
After I leave your name at the door.
Oh My Gosh!
Oh My Gosh!
A college party.
I'm so excited.
Whatever will I wear?
I think she was being sarcastic.
Yeah, I got that.
Anyway, you'll be there, right?
I can't.
I've got tons of work to do.
I'm falling for the behind as we speak.
Oh, so what?
There's always something to do.
Just have to learn how to juggle your priorities.
Hey, Roxie, could you do something with that music?
Oh, sure.
Actually, by "do something" I meant to turn it off.
And again we are in the mess.
Why were you sticking to pick up a fight?
I'm not fighting.
I just can't study with a music on.
That's all.
And I can't study with it off.
So, what are we gonna do?
Well, since you woke me up for first class breakfast I think you owe me.
Well, getting to make you lunch I'm being in debt forever.
Hey, you're stuck to those Plato's dialogues too?
Do you have any idea what the first was about?
I'm not sure but if you think the first word of each paragraph.
It makes the sentence.
"Mine enemy goes in green shoes".
Maybe, we should read quietly to ourselves.
For your gastrointestinal pleasure, another delicious Helda Spellman's original recipee.
Guess, what's in it?
I don't care.
Guess, what I like in you, Salem?
You're a culinary adventurer.
So much nicer than a big fat pig.
What an invigorating day!
Feeling eager young minds with the knowledge, challenging debates.
I mean the whole game done at the T.G.I. Friday's for margaritas and crazy fries.
Oh, I feel so alive.
Hildy, make the big scary lady go away.
Zelda, would you mind taking your self-absorption for a walk?
Hilda, what on Earth are you doing?
Don't tell me you spent your entire day doting on that cat.
I haven't been doting.
I say I gave him a few beauty treatments.
Read to him, cooked for him.
And made a delightfully amusing puppet show.
Listen, Hilda.
Sometimes when a person experiences a loss, say, a loved one goes away to college.
They project their feelings on someone else.
Say, a worthless cat.
They do this as the way of sublimating anxiety.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You mouth moves, sound comes out, and yet, nothing.
Okay, I've gone through understanding Plato and understanding understanding Plato.
Now what I need is Plato for dummies.
Oh, better yet.
Plato.
Look, Plato, I know you are the foundation of western thought and stuff.
But you seem to be talking in circles.
Can you help me out here?
I wrote this to empress someone I was seeing.
It'd better be Olympics.
A Vestal Virgin.
Yeah, right.
Do you have any nectar?
Greeks, conceive lucky, bad explanations.
Oh, you want an explanation.
It's all about reason.
You've got a power of reason and a couple of drachmas in your toga.
You're sitting pretty.
Ugly enough but helps.
Thanks, Plato.
Okay, that made Plato.
Next step's my 10-page essay on Franco-Prussian War.
I was just gonna throw this away.
The syrop is hard as a rock.
But then I thought it may have some kitschy sentimental value for you.
Do I look like I have time for dishes right now?
I'm overwhelmed with work and it is only my first day.
Relax.
Every freshman goes through this.
It's just the college as a way of getting rid of the weak.
Calling her.
Wow!
You've got invited to the Emerson party?
Yeah, but I can't go.
The guy I cheated an Ethics class has a brother who goes to Emerson.
My friend put me and Roxie on the guest list.
But I've got studying to do.
Sabrina As a resident adviser, I must tell you that Adams College values life experience as much as does the academics.
The last thing that you wanna do is neglect the social arena.
I've got a lot of work to get done.
But I don't think college get mad on me on not partying enough.
The key here is balance.
It's 9 o'clock.
Why don't you go for an hour?
In fact, why I don't go with you?
And then you'll come back fresh, rejuvenated and ready to attack the academics.
You don't think that'll be too distracting?
Sabrina, it's my job to advise you.
What I steer you wrong?
Well, like the college lads like to say: Party!
Party!
Party!
I can't believe I've almost missed this.
I know.
If you miss the Monday party there's nothing to talk about at the Tuesday party.
But then Wednesday.
You'll never catch up.
Sabrina!
Hey, finally!
I didn't think we are gonna make it.
Yeah, I have to do some studying before I could got loose.
Oh, I'll go with party first, study later.
Wow!
You're an animal.
It's already 2:30.
Well, you're not me I've got to do a paper in 6 hours.
Gotta go.
Oh, oh!
I've just got here!
Sabrina, you can't leave until you introduce me your friend.
Morgan, Josh.
Josh, Morgan.
Is everybody happy?
Yeah.
Very.
Lucky freshman's coming through.
Hey, I can do this.
Just type about that bad war and we are in business.
No problem.
Morgan was right.
I just feel refreshed, rejuvenated and ready to attack Sabrina?
Sabrina!
What's going on?
Am I finished?
I didn't wanna wake you.
But drool tends to short your keyboard.
Oh, I'm glad you did.
I've a paper due in 30 minutes.
All I've done is typed my name.
Sardina Smellman?
It's getting near.
Focus.
Okay, you can do this.
No, I can't.
Oh, I can't zap a paper.
That would be cheating.
But maybe I can use a magical pick me up.
Faster, speedy, quick.
Glad you're here.
Maybe, you can roll me over.
I wanna get that source.
Salem, what happend to you?
I've got life.
La dolce vita, baby!
Apparently, the life doesn't come in a low-fat version.
I think I can read well.
I don't think you can even be carried out of this room.
Okay, here's something about a double-time spell.
It helps you get your work done twice as fast.
Speaking of fast.
I ordered fry 15 minutes ago.
Hilda!
Shhh, quiet.
I don't want them to think I can't handle college because I can.
It's just the social and the academic part I'm having trouble with.
Okay, here it goes.
Step lively, step quick, make me move lightning slip.
Gentlemen, start your engine.
Save and print.
I could choose a listing faster.
C'mon.
Excellent!
And I still have 20 seconds to get to class.
Of course, Professor Flanagan.
I'd love to discuss your theories.
And just don't think the travelogies are in a proper environment.
That blur looks strange and familiar.
Alright, half a pound hand-ground organic dark-roasted brew.
You're a life saver, Josh.
I looked all over town for this.
Well, there were only once.
Unfortuantely, most people aren't that picky about what they drink.
Well, Salem is not most people.
Isn't Salem a cat?
Your point being No, I just think it's a little weird to buy a gourmet coffee for a cat.
Any weirder than a tall brown man in a little red apron grinding roasted seeds.
So, strangers can catch a bus.
Don't judge me, bean boy!
The blur looks strange and familiar.
Oh, Sabrina, you startled me.
I didn't see you come in.
What do you want me to do?
Oh, I hate to ask but the bathrooms could use a good one sober.
Hey, what do you think about the party last night?
I though it was by far the most amazing party Done.
Also amazing.
Well, I just must observe zone down there for a minute.
I'm going on my break.
Can you cover for me?
Anything else?
Sabrina, there're dozen people here waiting for I had a little down time, so I polished the espresso machine.
Well, I guess if you wanna cut out early then Man, what a gift to be 18 again!
Sorry, I'm late.
It took forever to find the beans.
And bad news.
The video store was out of "Space Balls".
Quit murmuring, start cooking and get some quotes on the double wide litter bags.
Alright, this has gone far enough.
Sorry, Zelly, I can't talk right now.
I don't want Salem to get mad.
You don't wanna make Salem mad?
If you don't leave immediately I'll be forced to set on you!
What you need is a healthy doze of reality.
What did you do that for?
Uhm, lemony?
How can't you realize that you displaced your emotions for Sabrina onto Salem?
And that he is taking a horrible, horrible advantage of you.
You're right.
What's become of me?
I don't even like being in the same room with him.
Today I fostered by hospice.
Try finding something to fill the void left by Sabrina.
Something that you're passionate about.
That's legal in the state of Massachusetts.
Step easy, step slow, make me stop this go-go-go.
Great spell.
But tough on a high tops.
Little help for a bloated feline.
Okay, I had the most amazing date.
I partied till 2 AM, still managed to finish my paper, do all my reading for the week, work, go to gym.
I think I got a perfect spell.
What's with slow and mow?
Miles?
Miles, what's wrong with you?
Good morning.
I'm late for class.
You haven't been in class yet?
Roxie, you're just goofing around, right?
You didn't do that double time spell, did ya?
Of course, I did it.
You were sprawled on the bed when I did it.
Sabrina, where do you think the extra time comes from?
You sucked it right out of them.
Why couldn't I sucked it from something useless like a spleen or a 20 pounds of fat cat?
I've got to try to get them back to normal.
It's not working.
Oh, no!
If they don't get to class then it'll be an academic probation.
It's all my fault.
Morgan.
I can explain.
If you can explain that top with those pants, you're a better woman than I am.
Stupid, stupid spell.
I gotta find the way to speed them up.
I'm officially out of ideas.
I've got one.
Call your aunt Zelda and have her get you out of this mess.
I can't.
I told her I didn't need her help.
Told I can handle everything on my own.
To quote the great philosopher Rene Descartes: "Liar, liar, pants on fire".
- So, if take A to be the atomic mass - What if A is unknown?
So now you want my help.
That's kind of what I looked for in a teacher.
I thought you could handle everything on your own.
I admit I have a cocky side.
But I've never said I knew everything.
Alright, apology accepted.
Thanks.
Shall I be more careful next time?
I think I put too much supersonic tonic in that last fadge.
Two drops of vital fire should bring them back to normal.
Quick!
I think they're carving out the floor.
Have you done anything between Road Runner and Nurtle the Turtle?
Time spells can be incredibly complicated.
They require very precise measurements.
This could take days.
I don't have days.
By then they'll be Right where they are now.
Why don't you always make such a production of everything?
A small sip of espresso and a little magical punch of a heart.
Usually does the trick.
What's going on?
How do I get out here?
Who are you people?
Staring out for probing.
I can explain everything.
Which one do you like better?
Overslept or alarm clock didng' go off?
- Both classics.
- Can't go wrong in either way.
Oh My God!
I overslept!
Ah!
My alarm clock didn't go off.
I thought I split the difference.
Nice touch.
Outta my way.
I've got paper to turn in.
Wait your turn, alien prank.
I just overslept my future.
Maybe, I could use a little magic to help them with their late assignments.
No need.
I'm sure I can work some my own magic on the professors.
And I won't have to point.
Thank you guys for helping me out And for getting me out this mess And for not loading much.
My!
You've only been to college for 2 days.
It takes a while to learn how to balance your time.
She speaks from experience.
And I have to admit, it's nice to know you have no problem with your aunties.
Well, at first I was a little annoyed when you got a job at the university.
But now I'm glad you to be so close-by.
- Were you real mean that?
- Yeah!
Well, then you'll be doubly glad.
Why?
You didn't get a job there too, did you?
I think you both at school might force me to join the army.
No, I didn't get a job at school.
I bought the coffee house!
I'll see you at work!
Maybe, I should do in the navy.
I do look better in blue.
And lots of places to go.
Guess what?
I finished all my work.
I understood at least half of it.
And now I'm free to party wity you.
Great!
Put up your streamers, take a chair and watch me to do logarithms.
The first day took us?
3 hours in the morning.
Just to clear this whoo-hoo.
It's whoo-hoo!
Have fun at the party.
Oh, I wasn't invited to a party.
I was just trying to find some fun to do.
Hey, what's more fun than logarithms?
A wild one, Spellman.
La dolce vita, baby.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
As the new owner, I intend to turn Hildaâs into Bostonâs premium coffee concern.
into Bostonâs premium coffee concern.
I will be totally dedicated and personally involved in every critical, coffee related, decision.
From the moment we open until the moment we close.
Youâre going to be here at five a.m?
Five a.m?
Whoâs up and dressed by five a.m?
Er that would be our customers.
And my life is supposed to revolve around them?
Hello, waiting for coffee.
Hello, having a meeting.
Hilda, you donât have to be here all the time.
We all take different shifts.
I call the afternoon shift!
Youâre the owner, you can take whatever shift you want.
Already, you are becoming my favourite employee.
Iâm promoting you to manager.
He is the manager.
Could somebody manage to make me a grande-latte?
Pipe-down Frankie, you should be home with your family having breakfast.
Look, Iâll make you a latte and er just for your patience, Iâll throw in a free scone.
Listen, donât bother, Iâm out oâ here .
Iâm going to the cafe down the block where they, not only, advertise coffee, they sell it.
Wait, come back!
Or better yet, take me with you!
Sabrina, The Teenage Witch S05E03 - Heart of the Matter Four bucks for a cup of coffee?
These prices are outrageous.
What am I paying you?
Minimum wage.
Hildaâs gettinâ a B-mer.
Hilda, er normally, at the end of the day, we split the money in the tip-jar.
Is that okay with you?
Absolutely, I can always use extra cash.
Er, a few things you should know about my aunt.
Sheâs insane sheâs insane and oh yeah, sheâs insane.
Sheâs just new.
Itâll take her a few weeks to learn the ropes but while sheâs learning, I could think of something that would soften the blow.
- soften the blow.
- Taking the next few weeks off?
Er I was thinking more along the lines of dinner, Saturday night?
Josh, how can I put this?
How about âSounds great Josh, Iâd love to goâ?
Look, I made up my mind when I started college that I was gonna try dating new people.
So date new people.
Hi, Iâm Irving, have we met?
Look Irving, nice to meet you but could you please tell Josh it aint gonna happen?
Why not?
What, you donât think weâd have fun?
Josh, a questÃ£o Ã© que temos um passado, vÃ£o surgir sentimentos â Josh, the point is we have history.
There are bound to be feelings and emotions and that could lead to something serious.
Iâm asking you for a date Sabrina, not to pick out a house and names for the kids.
Good, âcause I am too young to commit to the two storey Victorian with the big back yard for little Courtney and Todd.
â Todd?
Youâd name a kid Todd?
â The point is,I dated the same guy all through high school.
I owe it to myself to experience something new.
Letâs move it flunkies.
Iâm not paying you people minimum wage to sit around and yak.
â  So, are we still friends?
â Right, friends.
â Someone looks down, is everthing okay?
is everthing okay?
Yeah, I guess.
I am sure that itâs nothing that a double mochaccino canât cure.
Come on, Iâm buying.
Itâs on the house.
In your dreams Bean Boy.
Four bucks.
Wow!
Nice footwear Thank you.
I wasnât sure if open toes were too bold for the academic environment Oh no, I like open toes.
Open toed shoes.
I like shoes in general.
I mean I donât have a shoe fetish or anything.
I also like socksâ¦ but not with sandals.
You sure have a lot of books Miles.
You know my name?
Youâre in my physics class.
Yes.
Yes I am and may I say that Iâm flattered and impressed that out of all those students youâve remembered my name.
Youâre also Sabrinaâs room-mate.
Good point, I am her room-mate .
I mean we donât actually live in the same room, itâs strictly platonic.
Yes, Iâm familiar with the situation Iâll see you in class Miles.
Right!
Thatâs me, Miles.
So let me get this straight.
The problem is you like a guy who likes you but you donât wanna date him because the relationship has potential?
Exactly Next thing you know, weâre boyfriend and girlfriend and I can kiss dating other guys goodbye.
Please tell me this is not the worst problem youâve ever had?
So not.
The worst was when Harvey and Josh were fighting over meâ¦ but you probably donât wanna hear about that.
And yet, itâs already too late.
Oi, Sabrina.
Hey Sabrina.
Hey.
Hi, Iâm-Iâm Pete, from your English Lit .
class.
was wondering if youâd er if youâd like to umâ¦ Grade your pick-up line?
âDâ minus.
That wasnât a pick-up line.
Oh actually it was.
Do you wanna go to a movie Saturday night?
Oh well Pete, you know Iâ¦ Iâd love to go out with you but Iâve got plans.
What plans?
You told me you werenât doing anything?
Wellâ¦ I said that because I didnât want you to feel bad because my plans didnât include you.
Oh really, when were you gonna tell me?
Hello?
Hi, er Iâm the one being rejected here.
Sorry, thanks for asking.
So what are you doing Saturday night?
Nothing.
Wanna come along?
Hold on a second.
Although Iâm flattered, didnât you just say you wanted to date new people?
Whatâs wrong with Pete?
â I couldnât date that guy, did you see what he was wearing?
Two dimples and perfect teeth?
A white shirt.
Who wears white after Labour day?
You know, for a girl who wants to date different people, you sure are picky The guy at the pizza place was too tall, the guy at the student union was too tanned.
I just donât like that whole tall, dark, handsome thing.
Besides, I donât see you going out with a whole lot oâ guys.
I donât see a whole lot oâ guys asking me.
Whatâs your problem loser!
I canât imagine why.
So much for my afternoon nap.
Salem, what are you doing in my bed?
I told you never to sleep in my bed.
You say a lot of things sweetheart.
Whatâs eatinâ ya?
Iâm in crisis Iâm way to picky about guys.
.
I wanna date but I just canât get myself to say yes and the thought of putting myself out there again is scary.
Try a dating spell, it worked for me when I was a strapping young hunk Believe it or not, when it comes to the fairer sex, Iâm rather shy.
Is that why you had four different species slap you with a restraining order?
I promised myself I wouldnât use magic to solve every little problem.
Great!
Then Saturday night we can rent âSteel Magnoliasâ and you can give me a flea dip.
Later I need a dating spell and I need it fast.
Iâve been meaning to use my new magic CD-ROM anyway.
Okay, here we go.
âDâs.
Dakaries, dandruff, dates!
Okay, wrong kind oâ dates.
Here we go, Dating.
Oh hey, Sabrina Spellman, Iâm Roger Lodge Word has it that you want a date.
Wow, this eight-point-O version works really fast.
Having trouble finding guys who wanna go out with you?
Having trouble finding guys who wanna go out with you?
Please tell me thatâs not your biggest problem?
Actually, people saying that is my biggest problem.
Okay, hereâs your spell.
âThe guys who ask Sabrina out are tired of waiting,from now on Sabrina will say yes to datingâ Okay, youâre good to go.
Roger thatâ¦ Roger.
âVâ is volume, âTâ is Calvin temperature and âKâ is the constant dependent on the number of holes and the pressure of the gas.
My goodness, I was four hundred and six before I grasped that concept.
What?
I said, out of four hundred and six students, youâre the only one who grasped that concept.
I love this stuff.
I eat, sleep and breath thermo-dynamics When the other kids were playing with Lego, I was building my first cyclotron.
Thereâs nothing more exciting than your first particle-accelerator.
Oh yes there is, meeting someone whose eyes donât glaze over when I talk.
Been there.
Miles, Iâm considering having a private study group at the house, for my more advanced students.
for my more advanced students.
Would you be interested in something like that?
Very interested.
I think we should keep it small.
I agree, intimate is better.
- What about you and meâ¦ - Perfeito.
and Adam and Jenny?
Oh dear, my only free night is Saturday night.
Saturdayâs my only free night too, another thing we have in common.
I guess it was meant to be.
Would you mind telling Adam and Jenny?
And do you, Miles, promise to love, honour and cherish Professor Spellman until alien forces take over the planet and harvest you for food?
I do.
You do?
I meanâ¦ I willâ¦ tell Adam and Jenny.
Theyâre in my next wedding nightâ¦ I meanâ¦ class.
Hey Adam, hey Jenny.
Hey Miles, whatâs happeninâ?
Absolutely nothinâ that concerns you.
Hi ladies, gorgeous day.
Itâs raining you freak.
Whatâs with alien boy?
Heâs way too happy.
Maybe his Mr. Spock ears finally came in the mail.
Heads up!
Nice catch.
Yeah, Iâm here on a football scholarship.
Then I look forward to the next huddle In the meantime um would you like to go out Saturday night?
What do you have?
Some sort of a magical spell?
Yeah right, good one Er look, Iâm flattered but at this point in my life, I just have to sayâ¦yes Excellent.
Um do you like sushi?
I love sushi!
You hate sushi.
Pick me up at nine?
Well youâve done a one-eighty.
You actually decided to say yes to a date.
I realised I had nothing to lose by seeing whatâs out there and making an informed, intelligent choice.
Oh!
Yo-yo Pete!
!
Look, Iâm available for Saturday night if you still wanna go out?
But I thought you had big plans to do nothing?
Oh thatâs just an expression.
Pick me up at Seven?
Yeah great, see you Saturday.
You told Joe to pick you up at nine!
Oh good point.
Make it six!
And that way I can still fit in Hey you!
Excuse me, you have been here for three hours.
You have paid for one cup of coffee and had six glasses of free water.
Which reminds me, whereâs the bathroom?
At your house!
And take some of these other free-loaders with you.
And from now on, waterâs a buck a glass!
You know what Josh?
I think Iâm getting ripped-off.
The old owner said he had a lot of business.
The old owner did.
At this rate Iâll be chapter eleven by the end of the week.
If youâre lucky Half the customers have already switched to the French Roast Cafe.
I never liked the French.
Look, weâre not dead yet, we just have to figure out angle to win the customers back.
What was the angle when the place first opened?
- Erâ¦ the owner was nice.
- Weâre dead There has to be another way I know!
Weâll have a marketing blitz.
Weâll give away key-chains, coasters!
Fly-swatters!
Not the good ones.
Hilda, why donât you just dress up some poor schmo like a giant cappuccino and parade him up and down the street?
What?
It was your idea.
This was fun, Paul.
Yeah, itâs Pete.
sure?
Oh yep, six p.m, Pete, youâre right.
Are you dating a Paul too?
Um two Paulâs and a John Paul but not the one youâre thinking of but if his eminence does call, I am free Thursday night.
Gotta go.
Oh hi Dave.
Itâs Bob.
- Right, Bob, the phsych major.
- Actually Iâm a statistics major.
With a minor in boredom.
Okay, well give me sixty point two five seconds, I just gotta grab a sweater.
No problem, itâll give Roxie and me a chance to finish our discussion of census taking procedures in post war Denmark.
Iâd love to butâ¦ nobody should have to pick out a sweater alone.
What do you think youâre doing?
Combining fashion and function.
This works much better than the sweater.
Two days ago you didnât wanna go near a guy, now youâre going on twelve dates a night and Iâve become your social secretary?
By the way, Tad called.
Heâs running a tad late.
Another one.
I donât get it, first you criticise me for being picky, then you criticise me for going out?
I think you just like to criticise.
Sabrina, when you go out with each guy for only ten minutes, how do you even know who they are?
Who cares?
The point is Iâm dating.
Just like you said I should.
Fine!
Do what you want but Iâm not taking anymore messages.
Hello?
No, sheâs not here.
Who was that?
My mother.
Mrs. Spellmanson.
I mean Miss Spellman.
Oh Miles, you scared me.
Sorry I have that affect on a lot of people.
Youâre the first one here.
As soon as Adam and Jenny arrive, we can begin.
Oh Jenny and Adam called and said theyâd be a little late.
I guess not everyoneâs as dedicated to science as we are.
Oh, well I suppose we could begin without them.
I guess youâll have the leg-up.
Letâs discuss the concept of gravity.
Ah, the irresistible force that draws two bodies together.
I love gravity.
Is there a Mr. Spellman?
You mean daddy?
Oh you meanâ¦ No there isnât.
.
But letâs just stick to the subject at hand.
You do have beautiful hands, and look!
We both have slender pinkies.
So we do.
Anywayâ¦ May I call you Zelda?
no I feel like a complete dork!
Well of course you feel like a dork, youâre a cappuccino without any foam.
Now hit it!
Come to Hildaâs coffee house, she roasts the finest beans.
Come to Hildaâs coffee house, sheâs no longer meanâ¦ Come to Hildaâs coffee house, sheâs super-dooper niceâ¦ Hilda!
This is ridiculous.
Youre song is so stupid!
You are one bitter cup of coffee.
Hey, were are you going?
He hasnât even done the thing with the spoon yet.
Theyâre all going to the French Roast Cafe.
Oh come on people, gimme a break.
No ones ruder than the French!
Of course my father.
Heâs so rude, he makes the French look like the Swiss.
Oh and speaking of the Swiss, whatâs the deal with the cheese?
If those are air-holes, whatâs living in there?
Am I right?
And whatâs with the Swiss army?
How can they defend an entire nation with those teeny little red knives?
I got a million of them but I left them in there.
At Hildaâs, where every latte comes with a laugh and free waterâ¦ well just the first glass.
Come and join me wont you?
Well this was fun, Iâve never been to a bowling alley that served sushi before.
Iâm up scoring and the yellow tailâs always fresh.
This has been one of the best bowling and fish dates Iâve ever been on.
Look Sabrina, I really like you.
And I really like bowling and fish, so this date worked out perfectly.
No, I mean this is like one of the best first dates Iâve ever had and um Iâm really looking forward to a second?
Oh well itâs gonna be awhile.
See, Iâm still on my cycle of first dates.
well itâs only fair that I date everybody once before I start on round two.
Everybody?
Round two?
What is this, the Sabrina open?
Exactly, Iâm open to dating anyone who asks.
Oh by the way, tell your room-mate, racket-ball and Mongolian barbeque sounds perfect.
Thanks for a great evening Jim.
Joeâ Itâs Joe.
Itâs Joe.
Iâve gotta get name-tags.
Hey Spellman, dâya wanna watch me drop in on a half-pipe?
No, but I do wanna thank you for introducing me to that dating spell thatâs working out great.
Yeah well before you step out with Manny, Mo and Jack, you might wanna stop by âPet-Boysâ for an alignment.
What are you talking about?
Whatâs wrong with me?
!
Big picture, youâre obsessive-compulsive compulsive but the immediate problem requires a seasoned chiropractor.
It must be that stupid dating spellâ¦ or maybe Iâve got to start bowling with a lighter ball.
Iâve gotta get this spell off right away.
-Roger, are you there?
- Iâm on it Sabrina.
âPoor Sabrinaâs not looking well, so quickly remove this dating spellâ Nothingâs happened!
What am I going to do?
Do what you always do.
Go crying to your aunties to bail you out, Help me aunties!
Ha-ha-ha!
Iâm an independent woman, I donât need my aunts for help.
Yeah, this is easy Head misalignment âGo to aunts for helpâ Boo-hoo-hoo!
Miles, you and I are not involved, nor will we ever be involved, capich?
I love it when you speak Italian.
Admit it my Mamazelda, you feel an urge for little Milo too.
Unless youâre talking about the urge to toss you out on your canolli, I feel nothing of the kind.
Aunt Hilda!
Aunt Zelda!
Look!
Sabrina!
Whoops!
Iâll just be in the kitchen trying to straighten myself out.
Did I just see Sabrinaâs head sliding off her body?
You poor dear, those over zealous hormones are causing you to hallucinate.
Is that, in any way, attractive to you?
No Good lord Sabrina, whatâs going on?
I have no idea.
Salem convinced me to put a dating spell on myself and it was going great until my neck turned into a slinky!
I removed the spell but it just keeps getting worse.
Here, hold this.
Sabrina, when a witch is misaligned, itâs rarely caused by a problematic spell.
It usually signals a deeper problem that was there before the spell was incanted.
why couldnât I take after the mortal side?
Their worst ailment is an occasional hive.
There, that ought to hold you until we figure out whatâs wrong.
A nice look for winter but not great with a bikini.
Sabrina, why did you need a dating spell?
Youâve never had trouble getting dates before?
The spell wasnât to help me get dates, it was to make me more comfortable accepting them.
Well what do you think made you uncomfortable in the first place?
I have no idea.
Well thereâs only one way to find out.
Weâve got to get to the heart of the matter Oh-no!
Youâre not going to open me up like you did last Valentineâs day are you?
No need to, todayâs technology is more sophisticated.
I almost forgot.
Hey look!
Thereâs that nickel I swallowed when I was six.
Heart-speak!
Itâs not that I donât want to date again someday.
Well why are you taking your time?
Youâve been moping around all summer.
Let the heart finish.
Thank you.
I havenât been moping, Iâve been healing.
Well the best way to heal is to get back on the horse.
Donât play head games with me.
Iâm not ready to get back on the horse, Iâm still recovering from the last ride.
Sabrina, itâs obvious whatâs going on here.
Your head and your heart are conflicted.
She did it!
Itâs not my fault!
That dating spell caused your head to block out what your heart was feeling and thatâs why you became misaligned.
what your heart was feeling and thatâs why you became misaligned.
You hearts, always with the feelings.
Well I canât go out just for the sake of going out.
Iâve gotta feel something.
Well how will I know when you do?
Iâll give ya a little thump.
Well letâs see if that little talk did the trick.
Well letâs see if that little talk did the trick.
Course you are, youâre no longer blocking out the feelings in your heart.
Iâm gladâ¦ but do you have anything to block out the stomach?
I think that yellow tails starting to swim up-stream.
Hey Josh.
Man, am I glad to see you.
Iâve had the craziest day.
It couldnât have been crazier than mine.
Your aunt dressed me up like a giant cappuccino.
â Thatâs nothing, you should see the time she dressed me up like a giant pinea-calada.
It took me a week to get the coconut out of my hair.
Iâm surprised to find you home so early.
I thought youâd be out dating around.
Ah dating around is highly over rated.
All that: âWhat dâyou wanna do?
â âI donât know what dâyou wanna do?
â stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah itâs so great when you meet someone you connect with and you donât have to go on a bunch of pointless dates.
I think Iâm beginning to agree with you.
Whatâs wrong?
Nothing Iâm ready to go Josh.
Oh, you and Morgan are Are you sure youâre okay?
Maybe I should call a doctor?
But weâll be late for the movie.
Yeah, Iâll be fine.
I should probably just cut back on the fries.
You do that.
I erm I guess we should get going.
By the way, you look beautiful.
Itâs a great necklace.
Thank you, itâs mine!
I-I hope you donât mind me borrowing?
it looks like I have no choice.
So er I guess weâll catch up some other time?
Great -Bye -Bye Some other time.
You know, you have really stinky timing.
Er two blondes walk into a building.
Youâd think one of them would have seen it.
Iâm killing.
No, I did want to apologies for being rude earlier I guess I just had a case of new-job jitters.
Have you ever been on a job interview and theyâre like âWell what was the reason for leaving your last job?
â Well I found that after I was fired, there was a lot of tension in the office.
I found it difficult sitting on the new girlâs lap.
I once had a job as a receptionist.
I was so nervous, I kept answering the phone âHello, can you help me?
â Oh I like that.
Hey, why donât you come up here so we can laugh at you some more?
No, in fact, why donât we turn this into an open mic night?
If youâve got a joke or a song?
Anything thatâll pack âem in here and get me that B-mer
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Please.
Oh, please, please, please, please.
No.
How many times do I have to tell you I will not flamenco dance at the coffee house.
But I need an act to fill up my Friday night showcase.
And when you twirl in your red ruffled skirt you look so Rico Suave.
Sorry, seÄÄ orita, but I quit flamenco when Queen Isabella caught me fandangoing with Ferdinand.
All right, how about a hula?
A hora?
A Mexican hat dance?
I'll slip a flask of tequila in your sombrero.
I'm late for my gamma ray graduate seminar.
Find another sucker.
Where?
Moon River Forget it.
You are not singing at the coffee house.
Okay.
How about comedy?
How about juggling?
How about putting a sock in it?
That's it.
I'll be a mime.
Want to see me do my "trapped in a box"?
I thought you'd never ask.
A couple of air holes, please.
Ã¢ÂÅ Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine Ã¢ÂÅ I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
Roxie, what are you doing here?
Metabolizing glucose.
I didn't know you were into journalism.
Well, maybe if we ever had a real conversation.
Why spoil what works?
I have to get over this whole functional behavior kick.
So what do you want to do for the school paper?
The same kind of hard-hitting reporting I did for my high school newspaper.
I did an expose on two seniors that turned out to be white supremacists.
Oh, well, I uncovered a car-jacking ring that was working football games.
And I busted the cafeteria for selling expired yogurt.
Expired yogurt?
Yeah, have you ever tasted a carton of moldy strawberry peach?
Everybody sit down so we can get started.
Okay, you're all here because you want to write for the Adams Advocate.
If you want to write you have to bring me stories that are provocative and different.
Most of you will just be pestering small businesses to buy ad space.
I didn't come to college to solicit nail salons and pizza joints.
I didn't fight the war on yogurt to wind up with a desk job.
The two of you are already planning your first article.
Why don't you chatterboxes team up?
Actually, I prefer to write solo.
I prefer she write solo, too.
Everyone will be writing with a partner.
The two best stories go in the paper.
The rest will go in the trash.
Well, if it's any consolation I heard that Woodward didn't like working with Bernstein.
It's not consolation whatsoever.
The endless cycle of naked truth spins yellow.
Madness!
It's like crazy, man.
Salem, what are you doing here?
Auditioning.
I can't have cats in the coffee house.
But I'm a hep cat.
I hang out in the coffee houses all the time.
You dig?
That's deep, daddy-o.
Okay, here's our article.
We go to the Adams College Arts Festival and we interview one of the potters.
There's a news flash-- clay.
Right.
Okay, how about this?
We do a story on the lack of public transportation.
I mean, there are never enough buses to get the students from campus to downtown.
Listen to me-- I'm pitching a story about buses.
I've got it.
The pervasive paranoia and depression in American society vis-a-vis the end of human existence as we know it.
Too light and bubbly.
Hilda: Mr. Wayne Newton, please.
Hilda of Hilda's Coffee House.
Yes, I'll hold.
Danke schoen.
This is going to be so fabulous.
Everybody loves Wayne Newton.
What do you mean he's out of town forever?
You tell that pompadoured lounge lizard that he is no Paul Anka.
And that I'm never having his baby.
Who am I going to get now?
Ã¢ÂÅ I'm the cat in the tutti-frutti hat Ã¢ÂÅ Ã¢ÂÅ All the pretty senoritas go for that Ã¢ÂÅ Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi : Lucy, how many times I have to tell you-- you can't be in the show.
: But, Ricky!
Salem, you really think college girls are going to go for cats in South American drag?
I do all right.
Now be honest-- am I any worse than the other acts you saw today?
No, and you were definitely better than the gangsta gynecologist but I still can't book you.
Don't want to book me.
Don't split hairs, okay?
I still have a headache from Notorious G.Y.N. Aunt Zelda, Roxie and I have to write a hot article for the Adams Advocate.
Any ideas?
As a matter of fact I just heard something very exciting.
I knew you'd be a big help.
New measurements of deuterium at the center of the Milky Way confirm theoretical models that deuterium a heavy isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron is primordial.
That's been done to death.
So what did your aunt say?
Let's just be glad we're not in her Physics class.
Let's face it, we have no story.
We're never going to get on the paper.
Okay, Bye.
Out of my way.
I am late for something important.
Let me guess-- emergency mustache bleaching?
Don't be ridiculous.
Pumpkin facial.
All the rushees in my sorority are giving them to the actives.
Then they're polishing our pearls.
Don't you hate being saddled with a brain?
Wait a minute.
That's it.
That's our article.
Smart people?
No, no, no, no.
Sororities.
Shallow people.
Right.
And yet most girls would do anything to join a sorority.
Why would shallow people want to connect so badly with other shallow people?
We'll ask Morgan the next time we see her.
You don't get it.
Our story is-- "Sorority Girls-- Society's Lost Souls".
Pampered pearls pathetic.
I like it.
Thank you.
Here's what I propose.
We get the scoop by going undercover as sorority rushees.
Me in a sweater set and pleated skirt?
I can't think of anything more ridiculous.
Don't you dare tell anyone you ever saw me in a sweater set.
Okay, but it's going to cost you.
Cute outfit.
Great.
They think I'm one of them.
Good.
Now let's see if we can sound like them.
Talk about your summer.
I got Lyme disease.
We're gonna have to work on that.
Hi.
I'm Mindy Shivley, Rush Chairman for Mu Pi.
Hi.
I'm Roxie.
This is Sabrina We're so incredibly excited to be here and meet you and meet everybody and say hello and see the house and rush, and gosh, it's all so exciting.
I don't know what to say.
Uh, maybe you should take it down a notch.
Hey, Sabrina.
I'm glad you decided to rush.
Oh, what are you doing here?
Believe me, I'm asking myself the same question.
What she means is, she can't wait for the first pajama party.
Could I please have everyone's attention?
I'd like to welcome all the rushees.
That's us.
Look alive.
And a special thanks to Hope and Bethany for providing these delicious but oh-so-naughty cinnamon snaps.
Ooh, suck-ups.
Why didn't we think of that?
And now, to get us into the Mu Pi spirit why don't we all sing the Mu Pi song?
I'd rather have a colonoscopy.
I think they save that for the big Spring Mixer.
Ã¢ÂÅ Mu Pi peaches from the desert to the beaches Ã¢ÂÅ We always aim to please And we love our wine and cheese.
Oh, you're fantastic.
I'm putting you in Friday night at 9:15.
Maybe 9:20.
It depends when the Israeli guy finishes reading Jabberwocky.
That's great, but I can't agree to anything until you talk to my agent.
Salem Saberhagen, C.A.T.?
"Creative Acts and Talent".
He's handling a lot of performers from the other realm.
Salem is a convicted felon.
He can't be an agent.
Well, I suppose he could.
I really think Salem's going to boost my career.
Maybe you'll be the next Morty Ponder?
Who?
Exactly.
These cinnamon snaps are awesome.
Enough with the cookies.
We've got an article to write.
Let's go expose some airheads.
Let's do sound check.
Testing one, two, three.
Four, five six.
We're live.
Victoria's got a new secret.
Let's split up.
Roger that.
But lets meet at the cinnamon snaps in an hour.
Will you stop with the cinnamon snaps?
Hi.
I'm Sabrina.
I'm Lynn.
Are you as excited as I am at rushing Mu Pi?
Ecstatic.
I hear more Mu Pi's graduate with engagement rings than any other house.
That's why you're here?
To meet a husband?
Yeah, aren't you?
No.
My education comes first.
I want to do well in school so I can have a successful career.
Which will make you even more attractive to your future husband.
I don't mean to sound judgmental but isn't that a little shallow?
So, long story short-- my parents and I argued all year about which Mercedes they should buy me.
I'm sure you can relate.
Actually, I'm on a scholarship.
I live at home and take the bus which isn't bad but sometimes there's a bus shortage.
Bus shortage?
A smart person would have written an article about that.
So what are you looking forward to most about being a Mu Pi?
Like, doing your toenails with the other girls or highlighting each other's hair?
Actually, I want to get involved in their Volunteer America program.
Oh, where you volunteer to give manicures to the less fortunate?
Um, no, where they feed the homeless and read to the blind.
I was afraid of that.
So you're into horses?
There's a surprise.
I'll bet you've got the boots, the jodhpurs and that little whippy thing.
No, I intern doing equestrian riding therapy for disabled children.
But you wear a silly bonnet, right?
Come on give me something.
I've got nothing here.
Boy, are we out of luck.
Tell me about it.
This is the last cinnamon snap and Bethany is not parting with that recipe.
I'm talking about the story.
We don't have one.
These girls are great.
What they do is great.
So we'll do a different story.
We'll write about how nice and sweet these sorority girls really are.
I'd rather solicit pizza parlors.
You may get your wish.
It was nice meeting you, two.
I guess I'll see you both on Thursday night.
Oh, what's Thursday night?
Study night.
We meet here at 8:00.
How precious.
We all get together and do our homework.
Oh not quite.
we all get together and do the senior's homework.
What?
Isn't that cheating?
If you don't do it, you don't get into Mu Pi.
Bye.
I think we got our story.
A homework cheating ring?
This is big.
This is really big-- like really, really, really, really big.
FYI, when we write the article, I'm in charge of adjectives.
This is huge.
We're talking front-page stuff here.
I mean, with this article we could change the course of history.
Newsman: It's News On the March.
World menace taken down!
Sabrina Spellman and Roxie King win the Pulitzer Prize for blowing the lid off decades-old cheating ring.
We caught these dames red-handed.
It's bye-bye, Mu Pi.
Say, fellas, get a load of these gams.
Roxie: Sabrina, is there any particular reason you're showing me your thighs?
Oh, uh yeah, I've been working out a lot lately.
Let's start working out our plan to bust Mu Pi.
All we have now is hearsay.
True.
We will not be able to write word one until we have evidence, witnesses and quotes.
So our mission on Thursday is to come back and gather all the hard facts.
Yeah.
We'll call on the boys from the precinct.
We'll throw these peaches in a paddy wagon and you and I'll put on the Ritz and paint this town red.
I'll tell you what-- I'll do the writing you jitterbug for the troops.
Hilda, sweetheart, I love you, you know that but I only have so much wiggle room on this guitarist.
I'm getting pressured from all sides.
What sides?
!
It's you and a couple of business cards you printed up at Kinko's.
Why do you even want to be an agent anyway?
You wouldn't let me perform so now I have to sponge off the talent of others.
My client gets ten grand a night, take it or leave it.
It's a showcase.
Performers work for tips!
Okay!
Two bucks and a can of Starkist, and that is my final offer.
Shh!
I'm on the phone with the coast.
Jeffrey!
Steven?
David?
!
I can't believe I got all three of you boychicks on the line!
There's no one on the line.
At the end of the day, who's going to remember?
I will.
I have had it with you!
I've had it with you!
I've had it with both of you.
This has gone on long enough.
Okay, here's the deal.
Your guitarist gets ten bucks a show.
Salem gets a fish stick.
If it's a packed house, a side of tartar sauce.
Fine.
All right.
Let's close this thing.
I've got a lunch with the Budweiser ferret.
Did you put in fresh batteries?
Yeah, I'm packing two Ds, and believe me that is the first time I've ever said that.
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey, Roxie.
Welcome to study night.
Here are your assignments.
Sabrina, you're going to be doing Karen's homework.
Roxie, you're going to be doing mine.
But I don't know anything about the Punic Wars.
Neither do I. That's why we keep a comprehensive file of all the papers ever written at Adams.
Um, so what you're saying, Mindy T. Sheibley is that in order for us to become Mu Pi members  we have to do your What's that?
What?
That clicking-- it sounds like it's coming from your top.
Uh, it is coming from my top jaw.
I have click-jaw.
In high school, they used to call me "Click-jaw McGraw".
Now, back to us doing your homework.
Yeah, Mindy T. Sheibley.
Oh!
What is this?
Oh!
Oh, my gosh!
My pacemaker fell out.
I am so suing that heart surgeon.
It's a tape recorder.
What are you doing with a tape recorder?
That's a very good question.
And she has a very good answer.
Yeah, I do.
I use it uh, you know, in my classes to tape my lectures.
It's so small and comfortable, I almost forget I'm wearing it.
Hey, Felice, look at this.
I-I know it looks strange, but Oh, that is so adorable.
Strangely adorable.
I love it.
And it goes with your shoes.
And you never want to break up a set.
Now, can you please give it back to her?
Sure, right after I show it to Bethany.
Check it out!
Excuse me.
I need that back.
You know, it's not a toy.
Okay, family heirloom.
It's very fragile.
Oh, I have to have one of these.
Where's the "play" button?
I want to hear how it sounds.
Oh, no, you don't.
Why not?
Because Tell them, Roxie.
Because if you hear what it sounds like you won't be surprised later when you get your own.
Excuse us.
That was close.
Are you securely fastened now?
Yeah.
Ready for takeoff.
Hey, Lynn.
Hi, Nancy.
Sabrina.
How's it going?
Oh, not so great-- can you believe these girls expect us to do their homework?
It's a drag.
But if we want in, we have no choice.
Well, we could join a different sorority or not join one at all.
I have to join.
It's the one chance I'll ever have in life to fit in.
Four generations of women in my family have been Mu Pi's.
If I don't join, I'll be the black sheep.
So is it fair to say that the Mu Pi sorority is taking advantage of your family pressure, Lynn and your total lack of self-esteem, Nancy?
Well, you don't have to put it like that.
Well, I just feel like doing the Mu Pi sisters' homework is not only wrong but completely unethical.
I guess, but on the upside the house does do a lot of positive work in the community.
Plus, we get to make a lot of really good friends, like you and Roxie.
Me and Roxie?
Yeah.
We would never have met you guys if we hadn't decided to rush.
You're really nice.
I mean, you're super-nice.
Thanks.
I think the "super" part might be pushing it, but Well, you know we better get started on this homework.
With any luck, I'll have time to do my own.
Well, I've got all I need.
Mu Pi is going to fry.
This is definitely going to put us on staff.
We'll be editors by the end of the year.
I don't want to write this story.
What are you talking about?
Well, a lot of people could get hurt or kicked out of college.
I didn't hot-wire my bra so you could back out at the last minute.
This is journalism-- you write the truth and let the chips fall where they may.
But what if the chips destroy somebody?
I think I'm beginning to understand who Sabrina Spellman is.
You can't handle the truth!
I can handle the truth!
I just can't handle the guilt.
Roxie, We have to consider the ramifications.
These girls could get thrown out of school then their parents may never talk to them again and then what's going to happen to the kids?
I mean, you saw Girl, Interrupted-- murder, mayhem major box office disappointment.
I'm sure there's a valid point in there somewhere.
On the other hand, if we want to be responsible journalists we have to make the tough calls.
Whatever call we make, we better do it fast.
We've got a deadline.
But if we don't write the article we could wake up one day with no careers living in lousy apartments and kick ourselves for not taking advantage of a great opportunity.
Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves what do we want to be, compassionate but broke or gutsy, living in penthouses overlooking Central Park?
Are we writing the article or not?
Yes or no?
Ask me in an hour.
Sabrina: "Any way you slice it "the Mu Pi cheating scandal "taints not only the sorority itself "but the entire Greek system.
"It is incumbent upon us "to abolish these outdated hazing practices and return the true spirit of sisterhood to our sororities".
Brilliant.
That's what we're handing in.
I think we made the right decision.
And if you change your mind, I've got it on tape.
Hi.
You came home just to eat my breakfast?
That and I'm looking for someone to write my paper on Hemingway.
What is there to say about a model-turned-actress?
I'm pretty sure they meant Ernest.
What happened?
I thought your little Mu Pi lackeys were handling your academic needs.
Oh, didn't you hear?
Some Goody Two-shoes named Lynn rallied all the other rushees to take a stand against the homework thing.
They're not doing it.
You're kidding!
The Boston Times does not kid.
Somebody obviously talked.
I'm glad you two weren't involved.
Oh, by the way, next time don't get powdered-- it sticks to my lip gloss.
"Cheating scandal exposed at Adams sorority.
Rushees launch protest and stand up for themselves".
Let me see that.
Do you know why the women of Mu Pi stood up for themselves?
Because of me, Sabrina Spellman.
I made an impact.
I reached out to those girls, and I touched their lives.
You touched my life, too.
I did?
How?
Thanks to you, I've got no story.
The Boston Times scooped us, and now we've got nothing.
Wow, you're right.
Um, what should we do?
Sabrina, you should have thought about that before you took all night to make up your mind.
If we had come right home and written the story we would've made last night's deadline and scooped the Times.
Is that all that you care about, the glory?
I don't want glory; I just want credit for the work that I put in.
You have the credit-- the credit is knowing in your heart you made a difference.
Let me ask you something.
When you wrote those hard-hitting stories in high school what was the point?
To nail the white supremacists or to get your name on the front page?
Okay.
Maybe it's good that they did the right thing and that we're the ones that inspired them.
I think in the long run, we're going to be very proud of what we did.
I hate it when you're right.
I love it when I'm right.
And one good thing did come out of this.
If you mention cinnamon snaps again, I'll wring your neck.
What I was going to say was that we discovered the two of us make a pretty good team.
Yeah, I guess we do.
Unfortunately, we still have no story.
Well, I'll tell you what we do have: two plaid skirts we'll never wear again; two stretched-out bras; and, uh, the recipe for those things I'm not supposed to mention.
Hey.
Great news.
You're looking at Sabrina Spellman, college reporter.
Roxie and I made the paper!
That's fantastic, honey.
What'd you end up writing about?
We did an entertainment review.
The journalism teacher said she loved it's hard-hitting honesty.
Well, that's wonderful.
What's wonderful?
Uh, nothing you'd be interested in.
Well, let me see.
I see the name Sabrina in a byline.
"Coffeehouse Showcase-- Grounds For Staying Home.
"Every Friday night "Hilda serves up hot coffee "and lukewarm entertainment.
"The debut was a travesty "from the 'Jabberwocky'-reading paratrooper to the tone-deaf singing ferret".
Thank you.
The kid was just nervous.
It was his first time on stage.
I can't believe you trashed my showcase.
How could you do this to me?
You've ruined my reputation.
Keep reading.
"Although the talent was subpar "the lovely hostess Hilda Spellman "was a cup of pure delight-- warm, inviting and charming to the last drop".
Sabrina, this is great.
Did you read this?
Yeah, I wrote it.
Charming to the last drop but one bean short of a pound.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ugly cheesy That is so last year.
Stupid pet catalog.
Five bucks for a squeaker mouse and it's not even a good faux fur.
These people don't know diddly about cats.
Do they have a section on muzzles?
No.
Why would a cat need a  Aren't you the witty one.
Hello?
Oh, Hilda, that is so juicy.
I understand-- you're sequestered and you can't discuss the case.
Call me the minute you break.
First day on other realm jury duty and Hilda's already on trial, and it's a biggy.
Is it that shady ring of magic carpet cleaners?
No.
The defendant is the other realm's biggest and sleaziest supplier of black market hot tubs.
Lou Packard.
You know him?
We've broken bread.
Lou taught me all about the world of commerce how to move merchandise.
Wait a minute.
You two were actually in business together?
If Thailand could talk.
I'll tell you something if Lou's convicted and turned into a feline he'll be appalled by the outerwear in this catalog.
I mean, what cat with any self-respect would be caught dead wearing this?
The joke's on you.
I said a cat with self-respect.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
I knew we should have shoved our way up to the front.
Why?
He's handing out English papers not Macy Gray tickets.
Exactly.
I kicked butt on that paper.
I want to collect my "A" and slide into the weekend basking in the afterglow of a job well done.
Beats my weekend plans: helping my mother pick out her new toilet seat and recovering from the "F" I'm about to get.
You really think you failed?
No, but this way if I did I won't be disappointed.
I'm going shopping this weekend, too.
The Apocalypse Fest and Parking Lot Sale.
Killer deals.
Everything is priced to move.
Miles, you're up.
Look alive.
Professor Carlin, I don't mean to lay a guilt trip on you but a bad grade could put a dark cloud over my entire apocalypse weekend.
Bring me back a hat?
I always do, sir.
Professor Carlin, I just want to say what a pleasure it is to explore American literature with you.
I mean, as Mark Twain once said This bites the big one!
Ah, yes-- Becky Thatcher in Tom Sawyer.
She was a real potty mouth.
Sabrina, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.
I got a "C"!
A "C"!
Big deal.
You got a "C".
It's not like it's the first one you've ever gotten.
Oh, my God, it is.
Roxie, this paper is my future.
Getting a "C" is like being told "Nice try.
Now go hose down the Slurpee machine".
Hey, I got a "C," and I have no intention of hawking big gulps for the rest of my life.
I got a "D" and a giant question mark.
I'm sorry, guys.
You know how I am about my grades.
Psycho.
Psycho.
Hey, I worked really hard on this paper.
I just don't get what the problem is.
The problem is Carlin.
He doesn't want to spoil his reputation as the toughest teacher at Adams.
Not to mention he's a pawn of the establishment.
No connection between Huckleberry Finn and the rise of the military-industrial complex?
Please.
Mystery solved about his grade.
You're going to obsess about this, aren't you?
No.
Obsessing is what Miles does.
I prefer confrontation.
You hate confrontation.
Good point.
Would you go ask Carlin why he gave me a "C"?
Fine.
I'll do it, but you owe me.
Professor Carlin?
Oh, hello, Sabrina.
I don't mean to be disrespectful or anything but I just wanted to talk to you about the grade you gave me on the Huck Finn paper.
I think it is bogus and totally ridiculous.
Well, I like students who aren't afraid to express their opinion.
Keep up the good work.
Professor Carlin, it was a well-constructed essay.
My footnotes were awesome.
I triple-checked for typos.
I even included that bonus paragraph "Factoids of The Mighty Mississippi".
Look, Sabrina, the mechanics of your paper were good but your thesis lacked depth, originality and punch.
It was oozing with punch.
If you want to argue that Huckleberry Finn is about hypocrisy in society, I'm all for that but you need specifics to back it up: how did Huck's upbringing impact his relationship with Jim as they rode down the river?
Why did I have to say "river"?
Still, I don't think I deserved a "C".
Well, just work harder on your next assignments and eventually you'll get that "P".
I mean, "B".
I'm going to try the third floor.
"B"?
I want an "A"!
Oops.
Hilda, Lou Packard has swindled hundreds of gullible women out of their life savings.
Yes, I'm sure he has a very nice smile.
No, I will not go to your bank and make a withdrawal.
Call me later.
I can't believe it.
Hilda is developing a crush on Lou Packard.
What on earth?
What is all of this?
Salem, what did you do, rob a Petco?
Petco?
Please.
These are all custom-designed Salem Saberhagen originals.
"Anti-tick shampoo with jojoba"?
Zellie, witness the rebirth of animal retail.
My new business Cat-opia!
"Furniture, apparel, cuisine pour le chat a la mode".
"For the cat with ice cream on top"?
The gals in accounting came up with that.
Salem, you can't open a store.
You're no good with the general public and you have no thumbs.
Not a factor, baby doll.
This is strictly an Internet operation catering to the millions of felines with discretionary income.
I hate to burst your bubble but not many cats know how to work a computer.
Please!
Show me a cat that can't work a mouse.
I've got a much better vibe about this paper.
I'm feeling very confident.
Then why did you chew off nine of your fingernails?
I need the fiber.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
I told you guys what Professor Carlin said about supporting our arguments.
We all worked very hard on our papers and I'm sure it'll be reflected in our grades.
But don't go by me.
I can't believe this.
We did everything he wanted and we all got Cs.
This is awesome!
I shot up to average.
In a month, I could be wrecking the curve.
This is insane.
I mean, I supported my thesis This paper is filthy with subtext.
Spellman, when are you going to realize?
it doesn't matter how hard you work for Carlin-- "C" is the best grade anyone ever gets in his class.
Hilda, I don't care how dreamy Lou's eyes are love notes don't usually contain the words "or else".
Oh, honey, I've got to go.
Hi, Sabrina.
How'd you do on your English paper?
I got a freakin' "C," okay?
!
You're kidding.
I thought it was a wonderful paper.
I loved the way you identified Hawthorne's symbolic use of color-- Dimmesdale's white lofty brow Chillingworth's black heart and Hester Prynne's scarlet letter.
All leading to Sabrina's big fat "C".
You know, maybe I'm just not cut out for college.
Maybe I should drop out, join a road crew and pick up trash along the highway.
I could meet interesting felons, work outdoors plus I'm one of the few people who looks really good in orange.
Honey, you're not picking up trash.
You're going to stay in school and finish your education.
You know, I used to love English.
It was always my favorite language.
But now I don't care if I read another novel as long as I live.
Oh, honey, I know plenty of tough graders but turning students off to learning really cracks my corn.
I'm going to give Professor Carlin a piece of my mind.
No, please, don't.
Look, I don't want Carlin singling me out because I cried to my auntie.
I'm not going in as your aunt.
I'm going in as an educator.
I'll be professional and discrete.
You know how good I am with people.
Oh, Professor, so sorry to hear your wife left you.
She did?
Excuse me.
Are you Professor Carlin?
Yes, I am.
I'm afraid I've already hired my graduate T.A. Oh, you thought I was a graduate Aren't you sweet.
That depends on who you ask.
And you would be?
Single I mean, Zelda.
I mean, Professor Zelda Spellman.
Hi, Zelda.
I'm Arthur.
It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.
I've been hearing wonderful things about you.
-Really?
They say the quality of the science department's gone up 12 notches since you came aboard.
Well, I do have a passion for physics.
I try to use it to inspire my students.
That's very admirable.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, uh, not that you need a reason but what brings you here?
Oh, yes.
My niece Sabrina.
Ooh, I wasn't supposed to say that.
Oh, look, just between us, she's feeling very frustrated about her Hawthorne paper which I read and thought was quite good.
It was good but not great.
A great paper would have explored Hawthorne's frequent use of mirrors to reveal the characters in her thoughts and the emotional tension between them.
I'm surprised that wasn't obvious to you.
Well, I just skimmed it, really.
But the issue is bigger than this one paper.
I'm afraid that by being so tough on your students you're destroying their morale.
Zelda, I know I'm not the world's easiest teacher but I feel my role is to raise the bar and show these kids that they're capable of doing better.
That's what's going to prepare them for the demands of the real world.
It's true.
It's very competitive out there.
Things were so much simpler when I went to school.
We went to class during the day, studied at night and fought the Ottoman Empire on the weekends.
Rival football team.
Football fan, are you?
Well, I certainly could be.
So, did you talk to Carlin?
Oh!
We chatted some.
Well, what did he say?
Oh, this and that.
What this?
What that?
Well, he said that if you work harder you'll get a better grade and something about mirrors that I didn't quite understand.
That's all you got out of it that I should work harder?
That's the gist of hit.
Got to go.
Whoa, whoa.
I get the feeling there's something you're not telling me.
Oh, all right.
Professor Carlin and I have a date tonight.
A date?
You went in there to bolster student morale and you came out dating the enemy?
Sweetheart, he's not Saddam Hussein.
He's a man of strong convictions trying to get the best out of his students.
I'm convinced that if you really apply yourself your hard work will pay off.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for nothing, Aunt Sellout.
This is incredible.
I can't believe I got an "A" on the Hemingway paper.
That's the first "A" Professor Carlin's given out this decade.
You know, I didn't believe it but I guess it's true-- if you really apply yourself your hard work will be rewarded.
So, what time are you picking me up for our date tonight?
The sooner the better.
Looks like you're not the only one who's applying herself.
What does that mean?
Your aunt's doing all the work and you're the one getting rewarded.
Congratulations on your "A".
Stop staring at me.
I can't help it.
I never thought that you would be the one to rip apart the moral fabric of academia.
What can I say?
I'm good with my hands.
For the hundredth time my "A" had nothing to do with my aunt dating Professor Carlin.
Miles, would you just lay off of her?
We should admire Sabrina.
Thank you, Roxie.
She was just using her wits and her aunt's body to get the grade she couldn't earn on her own.
I did earn it.
That "A" was a huge accomplishment for me.
Of course-- another milestone in your insatiable quest to climb the ladder of corruption and evil.
Hey, I'm on your side.
Remember me when you reach the top.
"Through his juxtaposition of the ravages of war "to the beauty of the landscape "Hemingway reveals his personal code in a world fraught with cruelty and suffering".
This is a darn good paper.
I earned that "A".
Or maybe this is an average paper and I earned the eternal contempt of my friends and classmates.
I need another opinion.
Where am I going to find someone who's impartial and objective with a strong ethical sense?
Greetings, little lady.
May I please speak to the feline of the house?
What are you doing?
Branching out from the Internet to direct sales.
I need your opinion on my new products.
"Saberhagen's Miracle Worm Elixir?
Eliminates worms, blemishes and limp-whisker syndrome".
What's in this?
: Like I'd tell you.
Patent Pending.
Salem, I don't have time for your snake oil Hucksterism.
I got to figure out whether I earned that "A" or if Professor Carlin just gave it to me 'cause he's dating Aunt Zelda.
Dating?
For the past week, he's been chasing her around the house like an animal in heat.
Speaking of which can I interest you in a home spaying kit?
"An animal in heat"?
$12.99, and you get a full refund should you inadvertently have kittens.
Professor Carlin, do you have a minute?
Uh, maybe later, Sabrina.
I have a class if I could just get this door open.
I'll be quick.
I just wanted to talk to you about this thing between you and my aunt.
Ah, yes, the exquisite Zelda.
Hey, you never told me your aunt was a vision of loveliness.
Not unlike the young Lady Chatterley.
Funny, I don't know how that didn't come up in class.
Listen, can I ask you about my grade?
You must be quite pleased about finally getting that "A".
I'm outraged.
It's one thing to work hard for an "A" but it's another to be handed one you may not deserve because your aunt is dating your English professor.
I don't like what you're implying.
Okay, maybe you didn't do it on purpose but if you were easier on me than everyone else that's just not right.
I don't understand-- first you complain my grades are too hard-- now they're too soft.
I just want what's fair.
I would really like it if you would reread my essay and give me the grade I deserve.
All right, fine.
If it will make you happy I'll take it home and have a look at it tonight.
What is with the doors in this building?
Thank you.
No, Hilda, even if he is proven innocent.
I have no intention of double-dating in a hot tub with you, Lou and his brother Stu.
Oh, what now?
Hey, foxy mama, what are you doing later?
I knock off at 5:00.
I'm going to knock you off right now.
Hilda, I've got to go.
Salem, Arthur's going to be here any minute.
I can't have you driving around the living room on a forklift.
Sorry, but one of my boys called in sick.
Oh, feast your eyes on this baby.
I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this but what is that?
Meet the Relax-a-Cat the one-stop feline pleasure center.
Let me demonstrate.
Oh, go work it, baby.
That's disgusting.
Arthur's here.
Floor show's over.
In a minute.
This is the best part.
No, this is the best part.
Mmm peanut butter?
Interesting.
Hi.
Hello.
You look absolutely ravishing.
Thank you.
I've always depended on the compliments of strangers.
I believe the correct Tennessee William's quote is "the kindness of strangers".
I was making a joke.
Oh, well, I'll get my bag.
We'll be on our way.
Hey, Zelda, what is all this junk?
Just a few odds and ends.
Shouldn't we be going?
"The Ultimate Kitty Colon Cleanser".
I'm thinking of starting a little business on the side.
I like to dabble in different fun things.
A cat colon cleansing company?
You have to admit, you don't see anyone else doing it.
"Kitty Culottes"?
"Feline Footwear"?
Zelda, you shouldn't be wasting your time with this nonsense.
It's my time.
I can do what I want with it.
Why are you always telling me what I should and shouldn't do?
It's just I hate dabblers.
You also hate wines that aren't from France restaurants without Maitre d's That's not true.
I enjoyed Bonfire of the Vanities.
Of course, that was after a bottle of excellent French burgundy.
As usual, you're missing the entire point.
You criticize everything.
Zelda, all I was trying to say was it's the dabblers and dilettantes of the world who lower the bar and undermine the work of serious thinkers.
And it's the narrow-minded judgmental blowhards of the world who stifle creativity.
I hate those people, too.
I was talking about you.
Is that another joke?
Do you see me laughing?
Hey, Salem, you left your sample case at my house and there's an awful odor coming from it.
Yeah, that worm elixir has a shelf life of one hour.
But I got a new idea that'll go through the roof.
Flea-nut Butter.
Actually that doesn't sound too bad but I just might be giddy because of my moral victory with Professor Carlin.
I might be getting a lower grade.
Woo-hoo!
Zelda: You pompous jerk!
Carlin: You frivolous little dilettante.
You should really be happy now.
Sounds like Zelda's going to score you an "F".
Woo-hoo!
Oh, no.
I have had it with your nit-picking perfectionism always demanding that I do better.
Hello!
Physically impossible.
I was trying to inspire you.
But obviously, you're a hopeless case.
You infuriate me.
You disgust me.
You repulse me.
Are we going to kiss now?
No.
Just checking.
Hi, guys.
Care for some dried fruit?
No, thank you.
I was just leaving.
Oh, come on.
The figs are really yummy.
Yummy?
You call yourself a college student?
You sound like a five-year-old.
How dare you insult my niece?
No, no, no.
He was right to insult me.
I'd like to substitute "yummy" with "gastronomically pleasing".
Don't pander to him.
If you want to say "yummy," you say "yummy".
If you want to call him a big dummy, you go right ahead.
But I don't want to.
Well, I do.
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy!
Nanny-nanny-nanny goat.
And on that mature note, I bid you adieu.
Wait!
Wait!
She doesn't know what she's saying!
She's not my real aunt!
I am so getting an "F".
So, we're into bribes now.
That is so Godfather.
I like it.
It might be my last chance to salvage a decent grade.
You really think pork pate and a hard salami is going to help you?
And what's that stuff?
Flea-nut butter.
I'm desperate.
Good morning, Professor Carlin.
Hello, Sabrina.
I just wanted to bring you some things to apologize for the whole dilettante aunt debacle.
"Debacle"?
It's a good word.
Definitely a step up from "yummy".
You know, who was I to argue with your whole grading method?
Some naive college student, that's who.
So, I say let bygones be bygones.
You know, we go back to the original grade, start fresh.
Pate?
No, thanks.
Sabrina, I reread your paper, and you were right.
The grade I gave you wasn't fair.
So I changed it.
Why did I open my big mouth?
A-plus?
Are you drunk?
When I went through it again I discovered nuances I'd missed on the first read.
You did a truly superior job.
You deserved a better grade.
Even though my aunt called you pompous?
Well, I can be a bit pompous sometimes.
I'm afraid I owe Zelda an apology.
You know, Professor Carlin, I just want to point out that you have a lot of bright, motivated students.
And I think it's great that you want to raise the bar but sometimes you have to meet us halfway.
Point taken.
Miss Spellman, you've a lot of gumption.
"Gumption"?
Is that the best word you can come up with?
Yes, it was.
And I'm fine with that; great word.
Great to see you again, Lou.
The years have been good to you.
You, too.
We got some memories, don't we, Saberhagen?
We'll always have Bangkok.
Hmm, you know, I thought I was a goner this time.
Thank God for that ditzy blond who kept winking at me from the jury box.
That's my Hildy.
So, let's get down to business.
Ready to buy me out make a fortune cleaning cat colons?
I've done worse.
Yeah.
To me.
Schnapps?
Please.
To us.
: Oh I got the good jet.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Ooh hold it right there!
Ah, beautiful.
Easy for you to say.
You can't see what's in the bottom of this.
I think I'll call that one, "Girl With Cup".
I've got a better picture for you "Girl Doing Job".
You know, I could shoot a whole series on this.
"A day in the life of a minimum-wage slave".
Oh, I'm flattered, yet oddly put off.
You must be pretty jazzed about this whole photography thing.
I'm loving it.
After three years of just bouncing around and shelling out tuition I found the secret to enjoying a major.
Not changing it every two weeks?
No, picking something you're totally excited about.
I mean, this is the first class where I actually enjoy doing the assignments.
Well, maybe you'd enjoy doing mine.
I'm serious.
I think I could turn this into a career.
That's great.
That's awesome.
It's amazing you found something to be passionate about.
Yeah, for a while I was afraid I'd be making espressos and scrubbing coffee pots the rest of my life.
I'd be happy if you just did it the rest of the day.
Yikes, I wonder what I should call that photo.
Oh, how about "Boss's Brilliance Eclipsed Only By Her Beauty".
Make me double prints.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
It can't be the Avon lady.
She's gone dot-com.
You expecting anyone?
No, but if it's G-men, last you heard Miles Goodman is a towel boy, Club Med Pakistan.
Oh, no G-men but we got the J-man.
What's going on, Josh?
Oh, nothing major, just my whole world crumbling.
That doesn't sound good.
Come on in.
Thanks, Sabrina.
You know, it's a good thing I have someone who's sensitive, caring, and always there for me.
Thanks.
I meant Morgan.
Could you go tell her I'm here?
I would, but she's in New York shopping.
Apparently your sensitive girlfriend forgot to tell you.
Oh, man!
Why does Morgan have to be gone on the same day I find out I have no talent.
Who said you have no talent?
My professor.
I showed him some of the photographs I took and he said they were "ho-hum".
Big deal!
What does that bozo know anyway?
That bozo spent 20 years at Life magazine and shot over 50 covers.
So, who reads Life magazine?
People only look at it for the The pictures!
Obviously, I don't have what it takes to be a photographer.
I can't believe you're calling it quits after one off-the-cuff comment.
He must've said something encouraging about your work.
Yeah, sure, he said I had some potential.
But he called my pictures "pedestrian".
But "potential" is good.
And "pedestrian" isn't so bad either.
I mean, whenever I cross the street I am proud to be a pedestrian whoo!
Nice try, but I'm seeing a lot of lattes in my future.
You know, nobody's an expert when they start out.
You think Mozart just plopped himself down in front of a piano and started playing concertos?
Okay, bad example.
Look, the point is it takes years to develop a craft.
Look at my Aunts Hilda and Zelda.
Which craft did they develop?
Witchcraft, who said anything about witchcraft?
I like your pictures.
Well, some of the students did say nice things about "Bird on a Stoop".
Well, then, get out there.
Shoot more birds, more stoops.
This is your passion.
You have to go after it!
You really think so?
I know so.
And you heard it from one of the world's greatest pedestrians.
Hey, Aunt Hilda you know how you're always looking for new ways to bring in people to the coffeehouse?
You mean, like last week when I started that rumor that Brad Pitt had been spotted here?
That was a rumor?
I worked extra shifts!
Wow!
There really is one born every minute.
Anyway, I thought of a great new idea to bring in business.
Let local artists display their work here.
I'm not exactly bouncing off the walls.
You get a percentage of whatever they sell.
I'll take that as a "yes".
And you know, it's not just about money.
The coffeehouse could become a famous watering hole for artists.
Like the great salons of gay Paree.
I could be a patron of the arts An inspiration to young talent Great!
so where do we find our first artist to sponge off?
What a coincidence.
I think I see one now.
Josh?
He can't even draw the blinds.
He's a really talented photographer.
Hey, guess what!
My aunt wants you to display some of your photographs here.
Are you serious?
Absolutely.
My raison d'etra is to encourage creativity enlightenment, vision Cash only.
All sales are final.
Very powerful imagery.
Thank you.
I love the way the oak tree's beauty is juxtaposed against the hideousness of acid rain.
Oh, that's an iced mocha someone splashed on it.
Oh.
I love it-- the perfect melding of art and menial labor.
Sabrina, nobody's liking my stuff.
I think this whole idea was a bust.
Oh, that's not true.
Its going great!
I mean, look that woman is checking out your work.
She's checking for spinach in her teeth.
Remind me again, what is ten percent of nothing?
Aunt Hilda, you've got to have a little patience.
I mean, you know the saying: "Moulin Rouge wasn't built in a day".
That was Rome.
And if they had listened to me instead of that dufus Caesar it would've been done by noon.
Look, Sabrina, I know you meant well but the public has spoken.
My photos stink.
Wait, Josh, wait Brilliant!
Look over there.
Excuse me, Who do I talk to about buying this?
Me.
Did you hear that?
Someone wants to buy my photo!
No kidding, that's great!
Exquisite, isn't it?
We'd like to purchase this piece.
Sorry, this gentleman already asked about it.
I'll give you $800 for it.
However, no deal is final until the check clears.
$800?
Did you hear that?
I'm willing to pay $1,000.
$1,000 for that?
He'll take it!
Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of "Cat Without Shame".
My wife's going to love it.
Apparently he's married to "Wife Without Taste".
Whoo-hoo you sold your first photograph!
Yeah, for 1,000 bucks.
Not so fast, Ansel Adams.
One of those C-notes is mine.
Someone actually paid money for a picture of you?
That's right, toots.
for Saberhagen in the buff.
You're sure it wasn't pesos or lira?
Face it, I'm a natural-born star.
Zellie, I'm ready for my close-up.
Trust me, you have no future in show business.
I've already got one paw in the door.
Read this.
Hmm, "Open auditions for Little Wussies Cat Food commercial".
I faxed my head shot this morning.
The one with the "come hither" look.
Just how do you plan to get to this audition?
Purr, I love you I assure you, that is not helping your case.
Please, Zelda, let me follow my dream!
I'm a college professor.
I don't have time to be your chauffeur.
How about my co-star?
They want real pets and real owners in the commercial.
Oh, Salem, I'm not an actress.
Are you interested in what is or what could be?
Just look at that face.
Well, it is uncommonly symmetrical.
You want to hide those perfect cheekbones behind a physics book or share them with those who weren't as blessed?
Well, I wouldn't want to be selfish.
That's my girl.
Oh, I'm good.
I'm real good.
Josh, didn't my aunt tell you to clean up the back?
Uh, yeah, I'll get to it.
Hey, I'm thinking of shooting a whole series on asphalt driveways.
Wouldn't that be a huge seller?
Me, I'm more of a cement kind of gal.
But let's face it, you know selling art is a hit- or-miss kind of thing.
Some artists go years between sales.
Well, maybe you didn't hear me.
I said asphalt.
Josh, I don't mean to be, um oh, what is it called your boss?
But would you mind reacquainting yourself with a broom?
Hilda, relax.
I'm the guy that's turning your coffeehouse into one of the world's great salons.
And everybody loves a clean salon.
That's a beautiful cat.
Oh, thanks.
We just had Mandy's highlights done.
Your cat gets highlights?
Oh, they're worth every penny.
Mandy's been raking in the magazine work since we gave her the silver weave.
You know, you might want to do something with your little alley cat.
His coat does look a bit dull.
Miss Spellman, we're ready for you and Salem.
Well, come on, Salem.
I mean, here, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Mandy, what happened to your diamond collar?
This is Zelda Spellman and Salem.
Simply beautiful Oh Cat's a little scruffy, though.
Now, Zelda-- you'll say your line then you put down the bowl of Little Wussies and Salem will come running to eat it.
Got it.
Ready and action.
Fluffy is such a picky eater.
I've tried 40 kinds of cat food and he turned up his nose at all of them.
I sure hope he likes Little Wussies.
Excellent.
We'll see you at callbacks on Friday.
Did you hear that, Salem?
We made the final cut.
But you'll need to work with the cat.
He's way over the top.
Well I'm sure he'll get it right next time.
After all, he is a natural-born star.
And a diamond thief!
Excuse me, Miss, how much is this photo?
You mean you want to buy it?
Like, of your own free will?
It is for sale, isn't it?
You bet it is, let's go talk to the artist.
Hey, Josh, great news.
This customer is interested in "Dog on Credenza with Cat".
I work for a vet.
It'd be perfect in the office.
I'll give you $50 for it.
$50!
Buddy, that won't even cover the sales tax.
Josh, that's more than you make in a day's tips and more important, he appreciates your work.
Sabrina my photograph of your cat sold for $1,000.
This shot has a cat and a dog so it's worth at least 2,000.
That's too rich for my blood.
You know, they say an artist's body of work actually quadruples after he's dead.
Your point being?
If you're not behind that counter in 30 seconds, you're going to be one rich stiff.
Hey, don't talk to me like that.
You're $100 richer because of me.
A hundred dollars!
I'm going to Prada!
Okay, I think we all need to take a deep breath calm down, and remember why we're here.
To get America hopped up on caffeine.
Thank you.
Maybe you'll listen to her.
Okay, all right.
I think I see what's going on here and Hilda, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
What are you sorry for?
I feel bad that I have the talent to develop this exciting new career and you're going to be stuck grinding beans the rest of your life.
Josh!
Actually, grinding beans is the employees' job which at this point, is hanging by a thread.
Is that a threat?
Ooh!
Talented and smart.
Okay, you can save the witty repartee.
Oh, did you hear that, he called you witty.
I quit.
Josh, wait.
Aunt Hilda, it's not his fault.
Of course it's his fault.
Who else inflated his ego?
Thought he was God's gift to photography?
Made him think he was too good to do his job?
Can I get back to you on that?
It is still inconceivable to me to think that someone paid Josh 1,000 bucks for a picture of Salem.
Would it be more conceivable if that someone were under a spell?
You didn't?
Josh just seemed so depressed when he wasn't selling any pictures so I thought I'd give him a little confidence booster.
You boosted his confidence all right.
It's amazing his body can still support that beach ball of a head.
Do you know of any spells that can help deflate a guy's ego?
Only Mother Nature's remedy-- male-pattern baldness.
Great.
Now what am I going to do?
Oh, you won't have to do anything.
The real world will pummel that poor kid down to size.
Before you know it, he'll come crawling through those doors.
I'll save a space for that picture right here.
I'll call it "Employee Comes Back With Tail Between Legs "Begging for Job While Boss Tries to Find Shorter Name for Picture".
Titles are tough.
Hey, Miles, did anyone call?
Yes, an unidentified source made contact on my gamma scan.
No, I meant for me.
Oh, Josh called.
Oh, great.
Did he happen to say what a big mistake it was for him to just up and quit the coffeehouse?
Close.
He said he's never setting foot in the Java Jam again.
Great.
And oh, yeah.
He took the money he made and rented gallery space to have a showing of his work on Friday.
He sells one photograph and he's going to give himself a gallery exhibition?
Who's going to show up?
I'll go.
I think his stuff is pretty good.
You do?
Yeah, but I also like to lick the tops of nine-volt batteries.
Well, if you think he's good and I think he's good there's no reason we can't get other people to come see his work.
We just have to get out there and spread the word.
Tell all your friends.
You already know, and Roxie's out of town at her family reunion.
That was easy.
Miles, I'm desperate.
Get anybody-- your shrink the head of your Dungeon & Dragons club.
Wait.
Your shrink is the head of your Dungeons & Dragons club.
: I could've been someone.
I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.
Salem, what are you doing?
You're the cat.
The cat doesn't have lines.
I know.
I'm getting into character.
I'm a method actor.
What you are is a bad actor.
Oh, yeah?
Have you ever tasted Little Wussies?
I'm acting my tail off.
If only I had someone decent feeding me lines.
May I remind you that I'm the one the director complimented.
May I remind you that your skirt was hiked up to your nostrils.
If that's how my generosity is going to be rewarded you can just find yourself another quantum physicist to help you push kibble.
Zelda, don't go.
This is my process.
I'm a temperamental actor.
I have pictures of you with the Brothers Grimm.
All right, let's take it from the top.
Hey, thanks for coming.
Hey, free cheese and crackers?
I'm there.
Oh, hey guys.
Oh, hey, Josh.
Great turnout.
Guess you got your money's worth out of that Pennysaver ad.
Oh, it wasn't just the ad.
Obviously the guy who bought "Cat Without Shame" was so blown away by my work that he spread the word to his friends in the art community.
Uh-huh.
Works for me.
Excuse me.
Are you the photographer?
Well, I've taken a few photos.
But my subjects can't be seen with the naked eye.
I think this is the gentleman you wanted to speak to right here.
It's his show.
Great.
Maybe you can help us settle a debate.
I'd love to.
Is this longhorn cheddar or Vermont?
Oh, I'll look into that.
Um, Josh, why don't you go introduce yourself to that person over there admiring that picture?
Well, I see I'm not the only one who likes to stop and smell the roses.
Pretty cool, huh?
Beyond cool.
You can totally feel the vibe of the extraterrestrial hiding in this unopened bud.
Friend of Miles'?
As far as I know, he's still in Pakistan.
Uh, Josh, this is Ethan from Photo Op Magazine.
He says they're always looking for interesting new artists to publish.
Well, I'm new and interesting.
I think the real question is whether your magazine is hip and cutting-edge enough for me.
Uh, all that talent and a sense of humor.
My pieces concentrate on the intent behind an artist's work.
Was "Bird on Stool" a visual metaphor for Man's isolation in a soulless, technology-driven world?
Actually, I was just waiting for the bus and I wanted to get a picture of the bird before he flew away.
And?
And there's the picture.
So there was no aesthetic vision behind the piece?
I just liked the bird.
Photography is more than just pointing a camera at whatever crosses your path.
A good photographer should be trying to convey an emotion or a point of view through his pictures.
As opposed to me, who's just a ho-hum pedestrian?
Excuse me?
Uh, cheese?
We've been having an interesting debate.
Is this longhorn cheddar or Vermont?
I think that more thought went into the cheese platters than the photographs hanging on the wall.
That's not true.
These came ready-made from Costco.
Well, you blew it.
Not only did you race through your lines but on the day of our callback you dressed like Bea Arthur.
It's a look.
Would you quit panicking?
I'm sure we did fine.
Why else would they have asked us to stay?
Hello.
Isn't that skirt a little drafty for January?
The director seemed to warm right up to it.
Congratulations Miss Spellman.
You've got the part.
Really?
Oh, that's fantastic.
Hope you saved the receipt for that skirt.
Oh, obviously, they decided to go for the frumpy housewife look.
You'll be perfect.
I've got some good news for you, too, Mrs. Scott.
The role of the cat goes to Mandy.
Well, it's a good thing the party broke up.
We're all out of crackers and cheese.
Sabrina, that's why the party broke up.
It's the only reason those people came.
Let's face it.
I'm never going to sell another photograph.
I'm a one-trick pony.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're not cut out for this.
Is that what you really think?
Of course not.
But it doesn't matter what I think.
Do you like this picture?
Well, yeah, I do but other people don't seem to Oh, forget about other people.
This isn't about other people.
This is about you believing in yourself.
And if you measure your talent based on other people's approval your self-esteem is going to go up and down faster than a jackrabbit on a pogo stick.
Why are you suddenly talking like Jed Clampett?
I'm trying to make a point.
You told me you loved photography.
Yeah, I do.
Well, then you got to stick with it.
Persistence is everything.
You're never going to get better unless you fail every now and then.
Someone forgot to invite me to their gallery show.
So when does the party start?
It's over.
And you'll be happy to know I didn't sell a thing.
Josh, I didn't come here because I wanted to see you fail.
Sure, you neglected your responsibilities at work and treated me like dirt but I wasn't going to miss your first exhibition.
Now, where's that free cheese?
Hilda, look, I owe you a big apology.
My behavior at the coffee shop was totally out of line.
It's okay.
Sometimes people get carried away and do things without thinking about the repercussions.
Isn't that right, Sabrina?
Absolutely.
Look, I don't know what kind of photographer you are but when you pay attention you're a heck of a manager.
So what do you say?
I'd love to.
Great.
Well, I'm going to look around for a while and, uh, if you find any of that cheese give me a holler.
Hey, look, it's that guy that wanted to buy the picture at the coffeehouse.
Hey, I know you.
You're the guy who couldn't afford "Dog on Credenza with Cat".
Yes.
Just because I can't afford your work doesn't mean I can't enjoy it.
Aw, who says you can't afford it?
You did.
That was before.
Here you go.
It's yours, on the house.
I couldn't just take it for free.
Well, sure you can.
Between you and me I've still got a little work to do on my aesthetic vision.
At least let me give you the $50 I offered you before.
Then I wouldn't feel so guilty about the names I called you after I was laughed out of the coffeehouse.
Wow, so you got your job back and sold a picture?
Must be your lucky day.
Yes, it is.
Thanks, Sabrina.
If it weren't for you, I never would have had the courage to try this.
Well, it's the least I could do.
Trust me on that.
What do you say we take this 50 bucks get crazy and blow it on a brick of Velveeta?
Keep your money.
I saved us a little private stash.
Monsieur.
Thank you, Mademoiselle.
Oh say cheese.
Did I hear cheese?
Oh!
Hilda!
The commercial's coming on.
Hurry.
Oh, I can't believe you're going to be on television.
I can't believe they hired that no-talent, silver-tipped fur ball over me.
That's show biz.
You tried, you lost, get over it.
Shh.
Here comes my big entrance.
I've tried 40 different kinds of cat foods and Fluffy has turned her nose up at all of them.
I sure hope she likes Little Wussies.
There's my leg.
My arms, my arms.
Where's your head?
Little Wussies, you're a lifesaver.
That's it?
Three and a half hours in hair and makeup and they don't even show my face?
That's show biz, babe.
You tried, you lost, get over it.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Well, thanks for coming.
And tell your friends they're welcome to come and discuss their husbands, their boyfriends and their husbands' boyfriends.
What is it about coffee that makes people want to spill their guts?
I don't know, but those guts are going to buy me an outside cabin on a Caribbean cruise.
Yeah, this little beverage venture of yours does seem to be paying off.
Yes, it does.
This month I may actually turn my first profit.
Whoo-hoo!
I mean, ka-ching.
I just wish I didn't have to wait until the end of the month to see if I made a profit.
Wait a minute, I don't.
I'll just call in my Profit Prophet, Harvey.
Your Profit Prophet is a big bunny?
Oops.
Wrong Harvey.
Really wrong Harvey.
Hi, Harvey.
How you doing?
You know I've been thinking about you a lot recently and No time for chitchat.
Finally.
Sabrina, meet Harvey, the Profit Prophet.
Hi.
Nice staff.
Yes, the ladies seem to like it.
So, Harvey, is Hilda's going to be showered with shekels by the 30th?
Let's have a look-see.
Nothing is coming.
You mean nothing's coming for free.
Oh, so I guess he's not a non-profit Prophet.
So what's the deal, am I going to make money or not?
Not if you keep piddling it away like this.
Next time I go with Isaiah.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
I can't believe this.
I've already got a ton of homework.
How am I supposed to write a five-page essay on Hamlet's speech as a window to his madness?
What about the window to my madness?
I'm swamped, too.
I have to write a paper on Picasso then study for my exams on Organic Chemistry and Comparative Religions.
How do you do all this and fit in baseball practice every day?
I've learned to multi-task.
I'm on my way to the batting cages and I'm bringing my audio version of The Koran.
See ya.
Later.
Hey, how's it going?
About as well as Nervous Breakdown 101 can go.
Well, you haven't bitten down to the cuticle yet.
That's a good sign.
Like I didn't have enough studying already.
Now I've got to write an essay on Hamlet.
This school is killing me.
They expect me to go to class all day, study all night and get straight As.
You don't need straight As.
After last semester's grades I do or else I'll lose my scholarship.
Wow.
That's rough.
I don't even have a scholarship hanging over my head and I'm already stressed out enough.
My statistics class is killing me.
Here comes my professor.
He's a complete tyrant.
Congratulations, Sabrina.
You aced another data analysis test.
You've got a true gift for numbers.
Do you see what I mean?
What a jerk.
Here's my estimated monthly sales gross.
And here's my projected annual gross with a pudding stain on it.
Gross.
Hilda, if you want to turn a profit you're going to have to cut costs.
Or if you really want to make some serious moola talk to my investment counselor, Sid.
Hello?
Yeah, Sid, put me down for $100 on Run Like Hell in the fifth.
Hey, Morgan, you almost ready?
One more minute.
I'm layering my scent.
I don't want to know what that means.
Okay, how does this sound?
"Hamlet, the young Danish prince is possibly one of Shakespeare's most" most most Most repetitive characters?
Okay, so now you're making fun of me.
Like I'm not under enough pressure.
If I read this play one more time my brain's going to explode.
Well, now you've officially graduated to Madness 102.
Ryan, come on in.
Thanks.
Let me guess, you're here because you're having as much trouble with this Hamlet paper as I am?
Uh, no.
Morgan's fixing me up with a friend of hers.
We're doubling with her and Josh.
Oh, hey, Ryan.
-Hey, how's it going?
How do you have time to go out on a date?
Don't tell me you already finished your paper?
I'll do it after the date.
You know what they say, "All work and no play" Leads to the eventual destruction of the cerebral cortex.
Maybe it's just my family.
All ready.
Morgan, we're just going to Denny's for a burger.
You never know who you might run into.
Yeah, there might be a fry cook there that can put you on the cover of Mademoiselle.
Come on, guys.
See ya later.
What's up with that?
Yeah, I didn't smell any layers in her scent.
Not her, Ryan.
Well now he smelled good.
He knocks off his paper in his spare time and mine's going to take me all night.
I must be really stupid.
Well, first of all, you don't know what Ryan's work looks like when he turns it in.
Second of all, you know college is stressful enough.
Don't add to it by trying to compare yourself to everybody else.
I hate to break it to you but that's what the whole grading system's about.
Oh, well, in that case what are you talking to me for?
You got a paper to write, missy.
Hey, Morgan.
By the look of last night's eye shadow on your chin I'm guessing the evening went well.
Oh, it was fantastic.
We all ended up at this party till 4:00 in the morning.
Really?
That's about the same time that Roxie got done with her Hamlet paper.
-Wow.
You know, if I liked her more, I'd sort of feel bad for her.
You know, Roxie works her tail off for her GPA.
How is Ryan able to go out and party all night and still get good grades?
Hello, star pitcher for the baseball team?
Hello, don't understand what that has to do with anything.
Sabrina, you are so naive.
The school grades athletes way easier.
Plus the coaches encourage those guys to take cake classes which are guaranteed As.
Like Bowling and Lifestyle Skills which, by the way, I aced.
Giving any student that kind of preferential treatment is totally unethical.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Whatever.
Hey, Aunt Zelda have you ever been told to take it easier academically on star athletes?
No.
Although, I must admit I don't get a lot of middle linebackers taking Advanced Quantum Mechanics.
Why do you ask?
It seems to be a practice that goes on here with certain teachers.
That's appalling.
You know the same thing happened with the Varsity Jousters in high school.
In Alchemy, Merlin just let them pull As out of a hat.
Did you do anything about it?
When was the last time you saw a jouster?
This calls for a closer inspection.
Much closer.
Roxie's paper.
She'll definitely get an "A".
Hey.
She worked really hard on that.
And that tickles.
An "A" for party boy, that's insane.
I'll fix that.
Okay.
That's more like it.
Ow.
Hey.
Watch the earrings.
Hey!
Hey!
No, no!
This is the last time I buy from Staples.
I wonder if there's any Dramamine in that drawer.
Too late.
Sabrina, you've been working on that article for hours.
Can I get you anything?
Either a solution to unfair grading practices for athletes or a pumpkin bagel.
Pumpkin bagel coming up.
Hey, where are the pumpkin bagels?
In the pumpkin bagel patch?
Huh?
In the interest of lowering overhead we are no longer in the exotic carbohydrate business.
From now on, all we sell are plain bagels and glazed doughnuts.
Hilda, we have an eclectic, sophisticated clientele.
All right, a lot of the people who come in here look forward to their cran-apple poppy seed scones.
They may like them but in order for me to turn a decent profit I would have to charge separately for the crans, the apples and the poppy seeds.
Well, hey, if all you're worried about is profit why don't you just start making the cappuccinos with instant coffee?
Way ahead of you.
You just put in some hot, steamed mocha mix sprinkle cinnamon on it.
Nobody will know the difference except my accountant.
This article of yours is causing quite a stir on campus.
Oh, well, isn't that the purpose of good journalism?
To shine a light on important issues and make people think?
Exactly--and rumor has it the school is going to crack down on preferential grading practices.
Oh that's great.
I'm really happy for Roxie.
Finally the playing field will be level.
I'm very proud of you, Sabrina.
You stood up for what was right and you didn't have to cast a pox on any jousters.
You deserve a pat on the back.
Hey, there she is.
Nice work, Spellman.
Oh, hey, you like my article?
Loved every word.
Thanks to you, I'm out of the big playoff game on Saturday.
What?
The coach just benched me until I finish all my assignments.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
You just cost Adams College the championship.
At least I didn't give anyone a pox.
Way to go, Sabrina.
Because of your stupid article I can kiss my "A" in Bowling good-bye.
What are you talking about?
You're taking Bowling?
I needed a cake class to keep up my GPA.
Bowling was the one course where I didn't have to work my tail off to get a good grade.
But now because of you, my teacher says we actually have to show up and learn how to bowl.
You're really taking Bowling?
Yes.
And now I have to get an "A" on the Bowling final.
There's a Bowling final?
There is now.
Look, I'm sorry, I really am.
I just wanted to make things fair.
For you, for everybody.
Well, I'm not everybody.
I'm just someone who's going to fail Bowling and lose her scholarship.
Thanks a lot, Spellman.
Can't believe this is happening.
Can't believe there's a Bowling final.
One glaze donut and freeze-dried coffee coming up.
Thank you kindly, son.
So, how much rain you figure we're going to get?
Same amount as when you asked me five minutes ago.
That's true.
Those dang weathermen never get it right.
How much do you think weathermen get paid?
The same amount as when you asked me five minutes ago.
You have a nice day now.
Well, that depends on the weather, doesn't it?
You're catching on.
Hilda, this glaze-donut crowd is driving me crazy.
I'm ready to beat my head against the espresso machine.
Do it quick 'cause I'm trading down to an instant hot cocoa dispenser.
Thanks to the glaze-donut crowd, I'm rolling in dough.
Nothing against making money but the quality of conversation in here has gone from "Is there a god"?
to "Are you bass biting down at the lake"?
I had no idea you were such an elitist.
You need to embrace the down-homesiness of our new customers.
Hi, Wayne.
Huh?
Knee still acting up?
Lorene, let me know which hot dish to bring to fellowship supper.
I love that new leg, Fred.
Aunt Hilda, since when do you talk like someone who married their first cousin?
Since it started making me a pickle barrel of cash.
Yeehaw.
Check your I.Q. at the door.
Our new customers say it's looking like rain over and over and over again.
Well, I'd rather hear about the rain than how I'm responsible for Adam's star pitcher not playing in the game against Emerson on Saturday.
Josh, do you think writing that article was a mistake?
Absolutely not.
You stuck with your convictions, you took a stand you let everybody know that Sabrina Spellman cares about what's right.
Thanks, Josh.
Wait a minute, you don't care about the principle.
You just want your school to win on Saturday.
I want justice to win.
And if my school should benefit in the process so be it.
You have a nice day now.
Excuse me.
Any chance it's fixin' to rain on Saturday?
Could be, 'cause my knee is actin' up.
Course, could be from the other day when I bent down funny.
Oh, geez, there it is.
Hey.
Oh it's you.
You're not still mad at me about the game, are you?
No.
Now I'm mad at you because you put a major crimp in my social life.
Ryan was going to take Josh and me to a party but now he's home, chained to his books.
Look, I know it seems unfair now but in 20 years, somebody somewhere will thank me.
Please, God, I hope.
It certainly won't be me.
Me, either.
Thanks to you, I have to study Introduction to Bowling Theory for the all-important written portion of my final exam.
Then I'll have exactly one hour to throw a bowling ball that doesn't land in the snack bar.
I know how to bowl.
I could give you some pointers.
Oh, that's a great idea.
Miles is probably an incredible bowler.
I mean, that is a face that screams "I own my own ball".
with a monogrammed bag.
You can lift a 16-pound ball with those scrawny arms?
Believe me, it took years of conditioning.
Look, it's a great learning opportunity.
Plus, you're desperate.
Go!
Fine.
I mean, great.
Let me just grab a wrist guard, chamois and rosin bag.
It only gets better.
Oh!
I'm never going to learn this!
Sure you will.
It's very simple.
First, you step forward on the right foot.
Extend the ball, going through a down-swing.
Then, bring the ball into a back-swing slowly as the left foot gradually comes forward.
Then, when you reach the top of the back-swing step forward on the right foot going through a slide on the left foot.
Then, at precisely the moment the slide ends release the ball, thumb first, and position your hand at approximately a 45-degree angle to your eyes.
And that's all there is to it?
No.
I like to do a little dance right about now.
Hey, Salem, have you seen Aunt Zelda?
Since when did I become her personal secretary?
Hey which horse do you like better?
Shaved Turkey or Slap Me Silly?
I know I'd like to slap you silly.
And I'd like to shave a turkey.
The point is I've got to pick a horse and call my bookie.
Oh, by the by I've also got a boatload riding on the Adams-Emerson game.
Well, I hope you didn't bet on Adams.
Thanks to my article, the star pitcher can't play and everyone's expecting us to lose big.
I've got to page Sid at the track and tell him I meant Emerson!
God, I hope he's still sober.
Hi, honey.
I'm so glad to see you.
I can guarantee you're the only person in town who said that today.
You should be proud of what you did.
You tried to correct an injustice and that's truly admirable.
Then why is everyone looking at me like I'm the one who told Felicity to cut her hair?
Sabrina, you don't do a selfless thing for the glory.
You do it because it's right.
Well, I don't think it's right that Roxie lose her scholarship or for Adams to lose the big game.
There's got to be some way to set things right.
Well, you could use your powers to make it rain frogs but that's been done to death.
What about cats and dogs?
If you think frogs are messy Acid rain?
No.
Too much.
I'll come up with something.
Yes!
I think I'm finally getting the hang of this.
What's my score now?
Is that good?
Only if you're on a respirator.
Guys, how's the lesson going?
Do you really want to know?
I don't know.
Do I?
My final starts in five minutes and the only way I'm going to pass is if I run down the alley and throw myself at the pins.
Do they allow that?
Hey, I've never taken bowling.
I'm telling you, you can do this.
I showed you all the moves.
You just have to relax.
My scholarship's going right into the gutter.
How am I supposed to relax?
I may have a way.
Roxie's too uptight, we know.
Chill her out, so she can bowl like a pro.
Very nice!
Got to go.
Okay, let me start by saying I'm sorry.
Now that that's done let's get down to business.
Excuse me?
You got to finish your work and bring your grades up by Saturday and I'm here to help.
You want to help?
Turn around, and walk back out that door.
Okay, Ryan, look, you're probably so overwhelmed you don't even know where to begin and you've probably forgotten how to study you've skated by for so long.
And you're certainly not going to get anywhere by doodling "I hate Sabrina".
Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?
First of all, never spell "Sabrina" with three Ns.
Second of all, the sooner we open these books the sooner you'll be on that playing field.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Sit down, and let's talk Hamlet.
So, I finally break down and get myself one of them ridin' mowers and what happens?
It rains for days so I can't mow my lawn.
It's the darndest thing.
"The darndest thing"?
I'll tell you what's the darndest thing.
This conversation and every conversation I've had in this place since you glaze-donut people took over.
All you talk about is the weather, your fish and your farm equipment.
I don't care about profits.
I want my cran-apple poppy-seed people back.
Cran-apple poppy seed?
!
That's crazy talk!
Oh, yeah?
Well, how's this for crazy talk?
Skeedaddle!
Shoo!
Shoo!
Y'all, don't come back now, ya hear?
And take this complimentary jar of freeze-dried coffee with you.
The missus will really like this.
Thanks, boss.
Anyone want some of my tofu seaweed omelet?
Sure, I'll try it.
Ooh, it's not to eat it's a deep-cleaning facial mask.
That explains the witch hazel aftertaste.
Hi.
Nighty-night.
Hold on-- It's 9:00 a.m. Where've you been all night?
Ryan's dorm room.
What?
!
What?
!
We were just studying.
Yeah.
Right.
Like I've never used that one before.
Relax.
I was helping him catch up with his classes.
He's halfway through-- it's up to him to go the distance.
Speaking of which I'm not a witch!
Excuse me?
Sorry.
I'm really tired.
Did you say something?
I passed my bowling final with flying colors.
That's great!
Congratulations.
Yeah.
I'll be able to keep my scholarship.
And you know what?
It was kind of fun learning a new skill.
I have much to teach you.
Just think of me as your personal Yoda.
Or we could just stick with "Hey, you".
Oh, hey, Roxie.
Hey, Miles.
Why are you dressed like Ray Charles?
Oh, I just came to slip into my 3:00 class and slip out with my life.
That is, unless Ryan turned in his work on time and things are back to normal.
Hey, Spellman, I hope you trip over your laptop and die.
Well, at least you guys appreciate me.
It's good to know I still have friends I can count on.
We're here for you, Sabrina.
Through thick and thin.
Hey, Sabrina We're out of here.
I've got good news.
I handed in all my assignments and I get to play on Saturday.
Did everyone hear that?
Ryan gets to play in the game on Saturday!
Woo-hoo!
Ow!
How am I going to pitch if I can't see?
I can't believe I lost the championship twice and it hasn't even been played yet.
I was just having some fun with you.
But to be on the safe side-- do you think you could stay away from the field on Saturday?
Yeah, anything I can do to be a good athletic supporter.
Gotta go.
Adams leads, one to nothing.
It's bottom of the ninth, two outs.
Emerson's down to their last chance.
Johnson steps up to the plate Go, Emerson!
Knock it out of the park, Johnson!
No batter, no batter, no batter-- hey!
You know what I love about baseball?
It's all part of the game to be abusive and obnoxious.
You know what I like best?
The snacks.
Hey, peanuts over here.
Thanks, Salem.
How can you eat legumes when there's so much riding on this?
Salem, it's just a game.
To you.
To me, it's the chance to become fabulously wealthy or live as a fugitive and have my face surgically altered.
Johnson hits the ball deep deep, deep to left field!
Yes, yes, yes!
And it's caught!
The game's over!
Adams wins!
That should be Sid.
And I should be booking my plastic surgeon and the next flight to the Cayman Islands-- Toodles.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
There.
Nothing says love like a gussied up internal organ.
Any big Valentine plans?
No.
No, no big plans, yet.
Behold.
Hilda's Valentine's brew.
I'm calling it "Capapinko".
Looks like warmed-over Pepto-Bismol.
Ew, it tastes like it, too.
That's because it is.
Are you sure you're not going overboard with this whole Valentine thing?
Absolutely not.
Hilda's is going to be the place for hot young couples in the know.
Desserts, coffee, cabaret.
I'm going to perform.
Can you think of a better way to end a romantic evening?
I can't think of a faster way.
Oh, speaking of romantic evenings I've got to get out of here.
I still have to make my plans for Valentine's Day.
Which I'm sure includes a stop at Hilda's.
Yeah, right.
It's my first Valentine's Day with Morgan.
I want everything to be perfect.
I'm planning a moonlight cruise around Boston Harbor and as the boat gently rocks we can snuggle beneath the stars.
Sound romantic enough?
Sure.
If you're into that whole nautical display of affection thing.
I really admire you, Sabrina.
What do you mean?
Well, the guy that you've had a thing for is apparently head over heels for your roommate.
And you're dealing with it like a mature, rational adult.
What does that feel like?
Well, you just have to accept it and not let it get to you.
You know, it's nothing to get upset over.
Well, I am so impressed.
Think you can help me finish off these decorations?
No problem.
Okay, maybe I am just a tad upset.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
Sorry about that.
No, no problem.
Next time, I get to lead.
Smooth.
Guys like a girl who can do her own stunts.
Isn't he cute?
We've been smiling at each other all week.
I'm hoping he's going to ask me out for Valentine's Day.
Oh please.
Don't tell me you're another of those poor, pathetic souls who feels worthless if she doesn't have a date for Valentine's Day.
Well I guess I don't have to tell you now.
Sabrina, Valentine's Day is nothing more then a commercial rip-off.
They should just rename it St. Suckers Day.
Hey.
Miles, tell her that Valentine's Day is nothing more then a bogus holiday engineered by the greeting card industry.
In cahoots with the flower companies and candy manufacturers.
I have a hunch that the Trilateral Commission is also involved.
How cute.
I never realized how much you two have in common.
So, Hilda, got any Valentine's plans?
Oh, yeah.
Big goings on down at the coffee house.
And you?
Watching the Love Boat marathon.
Well, we're doing better than most years, my friend.
Cheers.
Of course, Zelda probably has incredible plans that will put us both to shame.
Just like she's thrown in my face every Valentine's Day for the last 611 years.
Guess again, girl-frent.
I happened to catch a peek at her appointment book.
Salem, that's private.
Hey, I had to use the box and I needed something to read.
Does anyone know why there's sand in my day-planner?
What are you smiling about?
Oh, nothing.
What are you doing Wednesday?
Oh, catching up on some reading grading some papers.
My Lord, look at that.
It's Valentine's Day.
And you don't have any plans and I do.
I am throwing a huge Valentine's bash down at my highly successful coffee establishment.
Hilda, when are you going to get it through your head that Valentine's Day is not a competition between us?
I've been waiting for this day for 611 years.
You really ought to get yourself a hobby.
I have a hobby-- gloating.
Yes?
Hi.
I hate to bother you but I noticed a few of your outgoing letters didn't have stamps.
Oh, sorry about that.
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
It's my job.
And you do it so well.
Say, would you like to be my date for Valentine's Day?
Well, sure.
Most people just give me a dollar or some stale candy.
What a delightful sense of humor.
Okay, well, uh, Wednesday then.
See you at 8:00 Calvin.
I'll see you at 8:00 Zelda or Hilda Spellman.
Zelda.
What?
How could I say no and break his poor little civil servant heart?
And you can make that 612 in a row.
I don't mind not having a date for Valentine's Day.
It's just I'm going to miss the romantic stuff, you know?
Yeah, I had this one romantic Valentine's Day.
This guy I was seeing gave me an ankle bracelet, a necklace and earrings.
Wow, that's quite a haul.
That's what the jury said right before they sent him away for armed robbery.
Well, at least you know he's not with another girl.
Oh, this year I don't want to hear another word about Valentine's Day.
Hey, guys.
Guess what Josh and I are doing for Valentine's Day?
Well, that was a blissful nanosecond.
Josh is going to surprise me with roses-- red, not pink and chocolates-- dark, no nuts.
And then he's taking me to dinner at this fabulous seafood place.
Gee, I never knew I was so thoughtful.
By the time she's through with you you'll be thoughtful and broke.
Well, I guess I have my work cut out for me.
I will see you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
What happened to the whole moonlit, romantic harbor cruise?
I never got a chance to tell her about it.
You know Morgan.
She knows what she wants.
Josh is so perfect.
I mean, sure he needs a little push in the right direction.
But what man doesn't?
This is absolutely the best relationship I have ever been in.
Well, you certainly had a lot to compare it to.
Thank you.
So, what are your plans?
Oh, no big plans yet.
But I'm hoping something's going to happen with this guy in my Philosophy class.
Name?
Kevin O' something or other.
Kevin O'Conner!
Tall, artsy asked me out, I rejected him.
Perfect for you.
Don't worry.
I will set the whole thing up.
Oh, no, no, no.
You really don't have to call him.
Please, Sabrina, it's the least I can do.
I mean, I owe you.
For what?
You're the one who introduced me to Josh.
Well, in that case, start dialing.
You owe me big time.
Don't tell me you're standing here trying to look cool just so Morgan's friend can discover you in the hallway?
Why do you keep asking me questions you don't want to hear the answers to?
Sabrina?
Hi, I'm Roxie and yes, the cool girl with water coming out of her nose is Sabrina.
Yeah, it's important to keep your nasal cavity well hydrated.
You must be Kevin.
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you.
Well, this is kind of weird but I guess we have a date for Valentine's Day.
Morgan did tell you that right?
Because if she didn't, then things just got really weird.
No, no, she told me.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I mean, you know, if you are.
Oh, yeah, of course I am.
So, uh Morgan will give you the details.
She's got the whole thing worked out.
Morgan?
Yeah, we're doubling with her and Josh.
I think the four of us will have a really great time.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Four of us?
A double date with Pete and Patty Perfect.
That'll be a rocking good time.
It won't be so bad.
I mean, Kevin seems nice and Morgan's easy to take in small doses and Josh and I have so much history we're practically like cousins.
All I can say is, I'd rather be in a Turkish prison than on that double date.
That could be so easy.
Shh!
I can't believe you're actually going through with this.
What could you possibly have to say to a mailman?
Well, it just so happens that I've been doing some reading and the history of the postal service is actually quite Why is there sand all over it?
Airmail pilots were strong and brave.
You're only going out with him so you'll have a better Valentine's Day than me.
Well, sister and I mean that literally this is going to be one for the record books.
Because after tonight I'm going to be the toast of Westbridge-- The queen of V.D. Valentine's Day.
That certainly says V.D. to me.
Morgan, hurry up.
We're going to be late.
Guess it's just going to be the two of us.
Got any plans for tonight?
What's that supposed to mean?
I mean, we're in the same house.
I'm not doing anything and I just thought maybe we could play Risk or Battleship or I'm going to go to my room now.
Roxie, why are you so mean to Miles?
I didn't say anything.
You can destroy somebody with a look.
Yeah, it's the one good thing I got from my mom.
I'm late so make it quick.
Blah, blah, blah.
I look gorgeous, blah, blah, blah.
Breathtaking.
Okay, let's move out, Spellman.
Bye, Roxie.
Have fun tonight.
And try to be nice to Miles.
I'll try.
As long as dork boy doesn't make me play Perquacky.
I have a feeling you won't mind.
Make Miles' good points clear as a bell-- let Roxie think he's really swell.
What are you mumbling?
Oh, uh, a little pre-date pep talk.
Go, team.
Roxie?
I don't mean in any way to invade your space but I just remembered it's Planet of The Apes week on the Sci-Fi Channel.
Do you mind?
No, I guess not.
I never realized what beautiful eyes you have.
You aren't by any chance talking to me, are you?
Do you see anyone else here?
So, uh did you grow up in Westbridge?
Uh, yeah, well, I lived here when I was 16.
That's really interesting.
No, it's not.
Come on, people.
Cut to the chase.
Now, Sabrina writes for the paper and is an accomplished scuba diver.
Kevin writes songs and once won Battle of The Bands.
You dive?
You write music?
Sometimes people just need a little push in the right direction.
And you're awfully good at pushing.
Thank you.
If you'd like to pick out your lobsters we can get started on your entrees.
Oh, I can do it.
My dad's a seafood wholesaler so I know my way around a crustacean.
Make sure they're alert, between two and three pounds and the shells aren't discolored.
Thanks for pointing that out.
You're welcome, honey.
Oh, I'm starting to get that tingly feeling.
Is your throat closing up?
Because you might be allergic to the shrimp.
That is so weird.
I just wrote a song about someone who's allergic to shrimp.
Reallly, it must be hard to find something that rhymes with "allergic".
Hello?
Trying to express an emotion here.
I think tonight is the night that Josh is finally going to say I love you.
To you?
I mean, like here?
Tonight?
I didn't know you guys were that serious about each other.
Very serious.
But here's my problem.
Now, when he says it, do I kiss him first and then say it, or do I say it and then kiss him?
Say it and then kiss.
Sabrina?
Uh, you know why don't I go mull it over in the little gull's room while I freshen up.
Let me guess.
You didn't trust me to pick out your lobster either.
No, I'm going to wash my hands.
Listen, Josh, I just want to say I'm really happy for you and Morgan.
I mean, I think it's great that everything's working out for you guys.
Sabrina, I'm breaking up with Morgan tonight.
What?
!
I have had it.
I am so sick of her ordering me around and telling me what I should and shouldn't do.
But it's Valentine's Day.
Well, she'll have something to remember it by.
A kiss-off and that cross-eyed lobster.
Josh, you can't break up with Morgan.
You really care about her.
I know, but she drives me insane, all right?
I give my heart and soul to her I get nothing in return.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't do anything until I powder my nose.
Can't that wait?
I guess it can't.
Julie McCoy, I'd meet you on the Aloha Deck any time.
Help!
I'm having a little middate crisis.
You think you've got problems.
Captain Stubing just got dumped by Phyllis Diller.
Okay, since the words "help" and "crisis" aren't registering is Aunt Zelda around?
Yep, she and Cliff Clavin are playing Post Office in the other room.
So So.
Oh, here's a question.
The new nine-digit zip code-- crazy fad or here to stay?
I'm not sure.
I think it's a law or something.
Aunt Zelda, sorry to interrupt.
Oh, you're not interrupting.
Sabrina, meet our new mailman, Calvin.
Sit, eat.
Let me get you a plate.
You're the niece.
Aren't you supposed to be on a date?
Oh, I wasn't I mean, I am on a date but the whole Josh-Morgan thing just exploded.
Give me the shorthand.
Who's Josh?
Who's Morgan?
Morgan's my roommate and Josh is her boyfriend who wanted to be my boyfriend while I still had a boyfriend but once I got rid of that boyfriend and wanted Josh for my boyfriend we were just friends.
With you so far.
Now he wants to break up with Morgan because he thinks she doesn't like him but I know that she does.
I'm sorry.
What's the problem?
If I don't say anything to Morgan and they break up that makes Josh technically available.
It's an interesting dilemma.
Does Sabrina help them fix their relationship or does she keep her mouth shut and claim the man who could be rightfully hers?
Exactly.
Well, in that case, Sabrina Morgan's your friend.
You're going to have to put your own feelings aside and do whatever you can to help her.
But she can't deny her feelings for Josh.
Hence the dilemma.
Is there any kind of a magical solution that might solve this?
Afraid not.
Your aunt's right.
There are no simple solutions when it comes to relationships.
Do everything you can to help your friends then if they still break up you won't fill guilty about making your move.
Wow, that's good advice.
Thanks, mailman.
Got to go.
That really was good advice.
I had no idea you were so sensitive.
Do you have any idea how many copies of Psychology Today I deliver?
Sorry, but you know how ladies' rooms can be.
Or maybe you don't.
I hope you don't.
Oh, look, lobster!
Ooh!
Oh, they're so small.
I told you to get the ones that were bigger.
Oh well uh, sometimes they take a few minutes to plump.
Happy?
Yeah, of course she's happy.
Everyone's happy.
Are you happy, Kevin?
Yeah, and if the waiter brings me a big bib I'll be really happy.
Wait, wait, wait.
No one eats until we have a toast.
Morgan, maybe they don't want a toast.
Maybe they'd just like to eat.
Josh, what is the matter with you?
You're always telling everyone what to do.
Is that what you think?
Yeah, it is.
You know, I think he means that sometimes you can just be, like, a tad Excuse me.
Our business.
Don't yell at Sabrina.
She's just trying to help.
I don't need her help.
Right, you don't need anything from anybody.
What I don't need is your attitude.
Oh, really?
You want the list of things I don't need from you?
Oh, a list.
Nice to see you finally organized something on your own for a change.
I'm so out of here.
And don't even try to stop me.
Morgan, wait.
If you see the waiter could you tell him we need some more butter?
Look, I am sorry you guys had to see that.
I don't know what I was thinking getting involved with Morgan.
Let's face it.
We were never meant to be together.
I was probably just another notch in her Gucci belt.
Josh, Morgan is in love with you.
What?
She told you that?
Yeah, she told us that while you were over playing God with the lobsters.
Really?
Well, if she's in love with me why is she always bossing me around?
Well, maybe she doesn't know it bothers you.
Maybe that's just her style.
Have you ever talked to her about it?
No.
Well, I think you owe it to yourself and to Morgan to get all your feelings out there before you break up or get back together.
Maybe you're right.
Josh, I think you need to talk to her.
Yeah, well, after that crack about the butter I don't think that'll be an option.
Good point.
Got to go.
Hey, what about our date?
Oh, it was fun.
Call me.
Come on, Miles, it's no big deal.
I just want to hold you.
I know, but it's not the right situation.
But intimacy's very frightening for me.
Then get ready to be terrified.
If anybody cares, I had a very traumatic evening.
That sexy little scamp thinks he can climb out the window.
Well, I've got a window, too.
Oh, ooh.
Morgan, you're here.
I really want to talk to you about this evening.
How could Josh treat me like that?
I thought he cared about me.
He does care about you.
He just doesn't like to be bossed around.
So I have an opinion.
If I hadn't organized the whole evening we never would have gone anywhere.
Yes, you would have.
Josh wanted to take you on a romantic moonlight cruise.
Really?
Why didn't he tell me?
You didn't give him a chance to.
If you guys don't start listening to each other more you're going to end up bossing around somebody new every month.
Well, that's what I used to do till Josh.
He's so sweet and sensitive.
The one guy that I actually could see having a long-term relationship with.
Sabrina, I don't want it to be over.
Don't tell me.
Tell him.
I don't even know where he is.
Uh, he's at the coffee house.
How do you know?
Just call it a hunch.
I've got to get some coffee.
Well, hello.
Welcome to Hilda's.
Take a seat.
So, are you ready to give up?
Admit that my Valentine's is ten times more fabulous than yours could ever be?
Actually, this date is going extremely well.
This mailman delivers.
Uh, just so I'm clear.
You're saying that this random guy who arbitrarily rang our doorbell is turning out to be your dream date?
It's a crazy world.
Yeah, it's freakin' hysterical.
All right, you're done.
Okay, happy Valentine's Day.
What a great holiday.
I'm about one bad relationship away from being one of those women who has 30 cats and pathetically names them after ex-boyfriends.
"Hairy Back.
Big Fat Liar!
Dinner's Ready"!
I had another cat that can't commit, but he ran away.
Ooh, there's Josh.
Go talk to him.
Oh, I can't.
Well, if you don't, I will and who knows what I'll say.
All right, I'm going.
Thanks, Sabrina.
Some of you are probably saying, "Wow, is she bitter".
Hi.
Hey, honey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I did the right thing.
Josh and Morgan should be together and well, I should just get on with my life.
Hey, how was the guy you went out with?
He was really cute but I screwed up the whole date before I even got a chance to know him.
I'm going to go home and eat my weight in chocolates now.
Sorry.
Oh, hey!
We got to stop meeting like this.
Kevin, look, I'm really sorry about tonight.
I handled things really badly.
Do you think we could try it again?
Yeah, I'd like that.
So, can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Sure.
Here's another thing I hate about people in relationships: that they're in relationships.
You know, I know a great place down the street.
Yeah.
I had a really great time tonight.
Yeah, we're on a roll, you know?
It's our first night out and we've already had two dates.
So, is it too early if I call you tomorrow?
You can call me as soon as I get inside.
Good night.
Whoops, I guess Miles had a few more good points than I realized.
I know how this looks.
I tried to put up a fight but she's very persistent.
Well, since it's almost the end of Valentine's night let's give Roxie back her bite.
Oh, my God.
What have I done?
You've made this the most special Valentine's Day ever.
You repulse me!
I'm okay with that.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Where do you come from?
Where do you go?
Where do you come from, Cotton-eye Joe Have I told you lately how much I like you?
No.
But, you know, sitting through "Hee-Haw Henry" just to hang out with me at work pretty much says it all.
Cotton-eye Joe Just my luck-- the one week I fill in and your aunt hires the guy from Deliverance.
I don't understand.
His resume said he had two Grammys.
But what it didn't say is that they were married to his two grandpappys.
Whoa What am I going to do?
He's driving customers out.
Well, at least they can escape.
Think about the poor banjo being held hostage.
We're the ones being held hostage.
The girl's got a point.
Luckily, so do I. Sorry, folks-- it looks like trudging out in this horrible rain has caused Jethro to come down with laryngitis.
Hey, Kevin, why don't you get up there and sing?
Me?
No, I don't have anything rehearsed.
Well, you didn't rehearse for that party Thursday night, and you rocked.
No, no, no.
You need to get home and rest that voice.
Better yet, lay that voice to rest.
Hey, Aunt Hilda, Kevin wants to sing.
Oh, fantastic.
Go right on.
I would, but I don't have my guitar.
You're in luck.
Look.
Somebody left their guitar.
Ladies and Gentlemen, put your hands together for an incredibly gifted young performer, Kevin.
So, are you serious about him?
Oh, that all depends.
On what?
On how serious he is about me.
Uh, this is a little song I've been working on, and, uh it goes something like this.
I used to be happy Just playing rock and roll The chicks were all right Till one rocked my soul But if it's meant to be I guess it's meant to be You can't imagine what What Sabrina means to me.
Does that answer your question?
I think so.
Life's changing around me, Âand I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
Sabrina, Sabrina you're incredible.
I feel such a deep connection with you.
It's hard to put into words.
Well, you did a pretty good job in your song tonight-- it was amazing.
Yeah, well I can think of something that's even more amazing.
Okay, but this is positively, definitely the last one.
Oh, you guys were spying on me, weren't you?
Hate to break it to you, Spellman but your life isn't that interesting.
Yeah, Roxie's right.
I mean, just because Kevin thinks you're incredible doesn't mean that we do.
If only you could lie as well as you accessorize.
What, are you guys taking notes?
And why are you so worked up about this?
Well, for one thing, a guy never wrote a song about me.
A guy wrote a song about me once but he used all four-letter words.
Look, I like Kevin a lot, but I don't want to get too excited.
There's nothing worse than getting your hopes built up just to have them come crashing down around you.
Oh, I am with you.
I don't know how many times I was in the perfect relationship then out of the blue, the guy dumped me because he found out I was dating his roommate.
A girl has to protect herself.
You better hope those looks never fade.
I guess what I'm saying is, I just want to take it slow.
Sounds like a plan to me.
So, when are you going to see him next?
Every night this week.
Sabrina and Kevin make the most adorable couple.
I've never seen her this happy.
Our little niece may be walking down the aisle before we do.
It is sad, isn't it?
What if she has kids before we do?
Larry Linterman died.
But Larry was in the prime of his life.
We were just at his 400th birthday party.
I just I just heard the news about Larry.
Why?
Why?
!
I didn't know you were so close.
Why didn't he make out a will?
!
I sucked up to that dunderhead for 20 years.
And for what?
So the Other Realm government could come in and pocket what's rightfully mine?
You know, Hilda, Salem makes a good point.
Sucking up to people is a waste?
The two of us should have a will.
We've got plenty of time for that-- we're young.
Compared to what, the Dead Sea scrolls?
All I'm saying, Hilda, is you never know.
Look at Larry.
-Well, that was different.
Larry was In great shape.
Yes, but he didn't -Smoke, drink or eat fatty foods.
Did he exercise?
Seven days a week.
Well, there you go-- we don't exercise so we don't have to worry.
Hilda, I know we're all hoping to live long lives but eventually we will Oh, no!
Don't go there!
Look, I know it's not a pleasant topic but we need to make sure that our loved ones are adequately taken care of after we Keel over; buy the farm; take a dirt nap; kick the Salem.
Then I realized I found my rainbow In her eyes.
Wow, that was fantastic.
I'm glad you liked it.
I can't believe you wrote a whole song and I'm still struggling over line one of my newspaper article.
Well, it's pretty easy to write when you have somebody beautiful to inspire you.
Sabrina you're my muse.
Wow, I've never been anyone's muse before.
Is there, like, a special outfit I have to wear or something?
You know, it's funny, before I met you it's like I would go in these dry spells-- I couldn't write a word-- and now it's like the music just floats into my head.
Well, you're not the only one floating.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, what are you doing here?
We've come to discuss our impending death.
Oh, my God, are you guys sick?
No.
But we could be.
We could drop at any minute.
You must be Kevin.
I'm Sabrina's Aunt Zelda.
You'll have to forgive my sister.
She gets a little nervous when it comes to discussing Why are you whispering?
Do you know something I don't know?
I have scurvy, don't I?
Oh, somebody, quick, toss me an orange.
Hilda, calm down.
You're fine.
We're both fine.
We just feel it's time to get our affairs in order.
Well, I don't want to think about anything bad happening to you guys.
Of course not, dear, but we all have to think about the inevitable.
Look, I think I should leave you guys alone.
I'll call you later.
Well, he seems like a very nice man.
Yes.
I'm sure he'll be very comforting when Zelda and I meet our maker in a rare New England earthquake.
Oh, Hilda, that's enough.
Dear, as I was saying certain provisions must be made in case Hilda or I Again with the whispering.
I would prefer to be cremated, and I would like my ashes spread across Orion's Belt.
Or thereabouts.
And I want to stay on the ventilator as long as possible.
I'm serious.
If you pull the plug, I'll know.
That's so morbid.
You know, before you guys showed up I was in the best mood of my life.
Kevin told me I'm his muse.
Well, that's great, honey.
Now, your Aunt Hilda would prefer a more traditional burial which means you'll need a good embalmer.
Oh, and when the deadly tsetse fly comes to claim us here's a treasure map of where I buried our money in the backyard.
It's in gold doubloons.
Hilda, I thought I told you to make a copy first.
Fine.
It'll be ready tomorrow after 4:00.
Kevin called you his muse?
That is, like, the highest compliment that a guy can give you.
Call me crazy, but I prefer "intellectual peer".
I've never heard that one before.
Sabrina, being someone's muse is such an honor.
Yeah, you're right.
I mean, I could be the next, like, "Layla" or "Mandy".
Or "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown".
Personally, I'd hate being someone's muse.
I'd always feel obligated to say interesting stuff.
Oh, I don't think you need to worry.
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey.
So, what's going on with my muse today?
Oh, uh, you know, a bunch of interesting stuff.
Um, I woke up, I got out of bed Dragged a comb across your head?
No, but I showered and I shaved my legs and then I tried to find some matching socks.
Do you want to write some of this down?
Hilda, come on.
We've only got 15 minutes to get to the estate planner and it's raining like mad.
Hilda?
Hilda?
Where do you think you're going?
-Oh.
Would you believe I have a date with Gene Kelly?
I didn't think so.
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought I could go through with this but I can't-- I really can't!
Hilda, get a grip.
We are only making out these wills as a precautionary measure.
You can't live your life in fear.
It's been working for me so far.
Aren't you afraid?
Don't you wonder what's next?
Is this the last chance we get, or is there a hereafter?
There's only one way to find out.
Last call for the hereafter.
All aboard for the river Styx.
Okay, we saw it.
Let's go.
Hilda this is not the hereafter-- this is just the boat ride over.
Have fun.
I'll be in the Admiral's Club throwing back some zombies.
Come on, now, you said you wanted to know what it's like, and we're going to find out.
Come on.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi.
Well, we are definitely going to be the life of this party.
Hey, how's it going?
Not so great.
I'm having writer's block.
For some reason, I just don't feel inspired.
Well, maybe I can inspire you with a hot vanilla latte.
Ah, no thanks-- when I hit these dry spells caffeine just disrupts my concentration.
Oh, and as your muse, I should have known that.
Um so, oh, guess what?
I found my missing sock and it's a really interesting story.
You'll never guess where it turned up.
My closet, of all places.
I find the rain is rejuvenating.
Wow, that is awesome.
Yeah, you know, matching socks are great.
No, no, no.
What that girl just said about the rain being rejuvenating.
That's perfect for a song.
I guess, but, you know I still like a good missing sock song myself.
"Rejuvenating rain helps ease the pain".
But what really rocks are my missing socks.
I am so bombing out as a muse.
Sabrina, I'm so glad you're home.
I need your advice on how to be a good muse.
Oh, well, if you figure it out, let me know.
Josh said that I didn't inspire any of his photographs.
Not even the ones of me.
So, come on, share your secret.
Well, I'd love to help you, but I can't.
I seem to have lost my touch.
Yeah, right-- I am on to you.
You just don't want to give away your secret so you can be the only one in this house who inspires men.
Well, let me tell you something, missy.
I have got a dress upstairs in my closet that is going to blow you out of the water.
Meow.
I love a good catfight.
Sabrina, let's talk estate planning.
Here's my proposal for dividing up our aunties' assets.
Our aunties?
I get the car, the house, the timeshare on Neptune.
And you, you lucky devil get that one-of-a-kind spider clock.
Salem, I don't want to talk about this.
I hope my aunts live forever, and I don't care what I get.
Already took the liberty of assuming that.
Sign here, sis.
Salem, I've got bigger problems than this, okay?
I've got to figure out how to be a good muse or Kevin's going to dump me for some girl who's more naturally interesting than I am.
I can't help you there.
The only thing I ever inspired was mandatory spaying.
Why don't you ask a real muse?
Why didn't I think of that?
Hmm.
Muses come quickly, I need to learn the art of inspiring before my roommates return.
Please, watch your step or not.
Doesn't really matter now.
Okay, I'm warning you.
If you are even one minute late picking us up What?
You'll kill me?
Too late.
Oh, hi, darlings.
Welcome to Sunshine Lakes.
Now, be sure to sign in and take a ticket.
This year, we're raffling off stretch pants and a whole year's supply of peds.
I'm Zelda, and this is my sister Hilda.
Oh, yeah, you're here on the day pass.
Could you please not use the word "pass".
I'm sorry, my sister gets a little uptight when it comes to the subject of Death?
I'm out of here.
Well, of course she's uptight.
When you're on the other side people see death as an ending.
But here on Sunshine Lakes it's a whole new beginning.
You're going to love it.
Every night, we have a picture show at the Jackie Gleason Auditorium.
A little tip: bring a cushion for your tushy.
Oh look, they're showing the director's cut of Rooster Cogburn.
I love the Duke.
Oh good, 'cause you're sitting next to him at lunch.
Oh, and the food is all you can eat Oh, and no matter how much you eat, you never gain weight.
Hello, heaven.
I'm sure you have fabulous classical music concerts.
No.
But you're going to adore the Minnie Pearl Clubhouse where we have everything from square dancing to bingo.
I love bingo.
Who doesn't?
What's to love?
There's no strategy.
You just sit there mindlessly waiting for someone to call out a number.
Well, you must have some really intellectually stimulating lectures what with Descartes and Socrates on the premises.
Actually, Descartes and Socrates gave up lecturing for shuffleboard.
They love just relaxing after all that serious thinking on the other side.
And you should see their apartment.
It's gorgeous.
Well, doesn't anybody use their brains around here?
What for?
We're dead.
Now, this is what I call living.
So, basically, if you want to be a good muse like I was to Beethoven all you have to do is focus all your energy on the artist.
Sit with him, talk to him But what if I run out of interesting things to say?
Then you compensate for that by catering to his interests.
Praise him, build up his ego anticipate his every need.
And you really think that will help inspire a guy to produce his greatest work?
Ever hear of a little ditty called Beethoven's Fifth?
Hey.
Hi.
Wow, thanks for inviting me over.
Yeah, well, you said you needed a quiet place to work on your music and I figured my aunts are going to be gone all night so it's the perfect place.
You're the best, you know that?
Always thinking about me.
Well, that's the muse's job, right?
All right, well, you go ahead and play away and I'm just going to be typing up my article for the school paper.
I'm sorry, Sabrina, can I bother you for a glass of water?
You know, I'm the one that's sorry.
I mean, as your muse, I should have anticipated your needs.
Water coming right up.
Or, you know what I could make you an iced tea.
No, don't go to any trouble.
But, you know, I wouldn't turn down a half ice tea, half lemonade with a twist of lime and just a splash of cranberry cooler.
For some reason it just helps get the creative juices flowing.
And what kind of muse would I be if I couldn't help you do that?
"Therefore, it is my humble opinion that" Wait a minute.
Is it my humble opinion or just my opinion and am I being arrogant if I call myself humble?
Hey Sabrina, which one of these intros do you like better?
-- listen to this.
Or They're both great.
I think I'm going with the second one.
Okay.
"And, therefore, it is my strong feeling that" Oh, what was I trying to say?
Why is it such a struggle for me to write these articles?
You know, I wish writing came as easy for me as music does for you.
Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a journalism major.
Maybe I should switch.
Do you think I should switch?
Hmm?
-Do you think I should switch my major?
Uh, I don't know.
Is there anything you like more than the major you already have now?
Well, I do like journalism.
There you go.
Switch to that.
That is my major.
Oh.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I am, Kevin.
Who's my favorite author?
Uh, Katie Salinger?
It's J.D. Salinger, and no, he's not my favorite author.
It's Jane Austin.
I talked about it for an hour on the phone last night.
Didn't you listen to anything I said?
Yeah, of course I did.
You told me how much you love my songs.
And anything about me you just tuned out?
No.
How can you say that?
Half the music I wrote was inspired by you.
That's my point.
You're only interested in me if I'm helping you.
Anything I say that's not song material goes in one ear and out the other.
That's not true.
You know, Kevin, I really don't want to be in a one-way relationship and I really don't want to be anybody's muse.
Wha Sabrina, wait.
No, I am so out of here.
No, this is I but Wait a minute.
This is my aunts' house.
And I don't want to hear about this in any song.
I did it.
I stared death right in the face and I had the time of my life.
I also beat Descartes at shuffleboard and I dirty danced with Fred Mertz.
Whatever floats your boat.
And now, because of you I realize that death is nothing to be afraid of.
It's just one big bash full of casinos, canasta, and kugel.
Josh, I have been waiting here all morning.
Hasn't anything that I have said or done inspired you?
Yeah, you just inspired me to make the best latte of my entire coffee career.
Everybody hear that?
I am not just beautiful and smart.
I'm a muse.
Look at me.
I am a muse.
Hello, people.
What a glorious day.
You can already smell spring in the air.
Your aunt scares me when she's this happy.
Roxie, you did a fantastic job filling in this week.
Here's a bonus as a token of appreciation.
On the other hand, it's kind of appealing.
Well, you're sure in a good mood today.
And why shouldn't I be?
I love life.
I love death.
Like you kids say, "It's all good".
Oh, we've been saying that all morning.
But why am I talking to you about death?
You're young, alive and in love.
Well, you got the first part right.
Turns out Kevin was a little too self-absorbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
Oh, by the way when I die and you stick me in the casket make sure I'm wearing comfortable shoes.
Anybody know a place that makes a good vanilla latte?
Kevin.
Sabrina, I know you're upset and you probably don't want to give me a second chance, but But what?
Well, I read your article on college arts funding.
It was terrific.
That's nice, but, you know reading one article isn't going to fix everything.
Yeah, well, I read all your articles-- uh, sororities, animal testing-- and they closed the library before I could finish the one on the gas leaf blowers.
Oh, I had the flu when I wrote that one.
Look, what I'm trying to say is if you change your major journalism will be losing one heck of a writer.
You're not just saying that because you want to get back together?
Look, I know I really blew this relationship and if you don't want to give me a second chance I totally understand.
It's just, well, you really mean a lot to me.
And well Wow, Pride and Prejudice.
You bought this for me?
No, I swiped it from the library.
I'm kidding.
Thanks.
It means a lot to me that you remembered.
Listen, do you want to go someplace after your shift is over?
I'd like that.
I bet you'd like it even better if you left now.
Well, wouldn't you be shorthanded?
I'll live, and if not the alternative's not bad, either.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Seize the day, Sabrina.
Life's short if you're lucky.
Oh, I can't believe those dumb broads just left a treasure map lying around the kitchen.
I'd expect it from Hilda but a quantum physicist?
There's over $500,000 of gold buried in this dirt.
Oh, Lord have mercy.
I've hit the mother load!
Thanks to the hags I'll be able to blow this pop stand one filthy rich cat.
Well, he was right about the filthy part.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
All right, not only am I the world's greatest roommate I'm also the world's greatest travel agent.
Our spring break problems are over.
Sabrina, I know how badly you want to go to Florida but I am not sleeping in somebody's car.
You don't have to.
We're staying at the Surfside Motel in Pelican Cove, Florida.
It's the hottest place for spring break this year-- a 24-hour party.
Spellman, how did you pull this off?
Ah, while you were all whiny about not having plans I was surfing the net for a place to surf.
I also got some Jeb Bush flippers on e-bay.
I take back what I said about you this morning.
You rock.
Girls, man your bikinis because we are heading south for spring break!
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
I'm guessing you're not jumping around because of the new hand dryer in the restroom.
No.
If we finish our midterms by next week we will be in Pelican Cove, Florida.
That is, if you give me the week off.
Of course I will.
With all the studying you've been doing you deserve a fun spring break.
Cruising the strip, tanning on the beach ogling the lifeguards.
Hey, can I go?
Hey, Josh.
Guess where you'll be kissing me next week?
Uh, on your neck?
Yes, but you'll be doing it in Pelican Cove.
We're all going to Florida.
All right!
Yes.
Hey, I've been wanting to do some scuba diving.
Now we can do it together.
Oh, that would be fun.
As long as we don't have to go in the water.
Salt's murder on my hair.
Although I do look fabulous in neoprene.
Me, too.
What about Kevin?
Are you going to invite him?
I don't know.
I mean, Kevin and I haven't been dating that long.
I-I want him to go but I don't want to put him on the spot.
Oh, come on.
I put guys on the spot all the time.
It's fun to watch the blood rush to their faces.
Asking Kevin to go on our first trip together is a big deal.
I need to think about it.
Hey, what's going on?
Uh, we got new hand dryers in the bathroom.
You want to come to Florida with us for spring break?
Yeah, I'm there.
Morgan!
You don't have to thank me now.
But, FYI, I'm a size four.
Well, thank goodness Sabrina's going to be spending spring break working in the coffee shop.
Unless someone accidentally gave her the week off to go to Florida.
Hilda.
Well, Sabrina has been working so hard I thought she deserved a week of R&R with her roommates and Kevin.
Kevin's going, too?
Let the debauchery begin.
Look, let's not panic.
This is Sabrina we're talking about.
A mature, responsible college student.
Well, I suppose you're right.
I mean, after all we took many a spring break sojourn ourselves.
Remember that fabulous trip we took to the Acropolis with those adorable fraternity brothers?
Mmm.
Uh-oh.
Just think-- Florida.
There'll be guys from all over the Eastern seaboard.
Remember, we said no talk of spring break until after we're done studying for our last exam.
Sorry.
Oh, I got the cutest little pink bikini today.
This trip is going to be so great.
Even the drive down will be fun.
Yeah, you and Kevin, Josh and Morgan and me and Elroy Jetson.
Wow, no one's called me that since second grade.
I just wish I knew if Kevin was going because he wants to have fun in Florida or because he thinks of me as his girlfriend.
The guy's been dating you for six weeks.
You're his girlfriend.
He wrote a song about you.
He also wrote a song about Janet Reno.
You'll have a whole week together.
That should be plenty of time to find out how he feels about you.
You're right.
I just have to talk to him and ask him where he stands.
And find out if he has a brother.
What are you guys doing here?
We were just in the neighborhood.
For no special reason.
It's not like we want to talk about Florida.
You do know that they get hurricanes there this time of year.
And mosquitoes as big as my cousin Estelle.
Okay, you didn't come here to talk to me about the weather and bloodsucking relatives.
You're right.
Sabrina, it's just that we're concerned about you going away on spring break unchaperoned.
I started thinking about the college vacations I took like that night in Naples when I wound up in a fountain with two massive gladiators I think I made my point.
Look, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm going with all my good friends and a guy I just happen to be dating.
It's that last part that we're worried about.
So what your saying is you don't trust me.
No, we're not saying that.
It's just that sometimes young people can get caught up in the passion of the moment and do things they might later regret.
Like floating down a canal in Venice wearing nothing but a fig leaf and two single-serving pizzas.
Look, just because you made mistakes when you were young doesn't mean that I'm going to.
I'm a responsible adult and I think I've proven that time and time again.
I need you to trust me.
Can you do that?
Of course we can.
We could just not give her the money to go.
That would work if someone hadn't accidentally given her an advance on her paycheck.
What do you want from me?
I'm accident-prone.
Here's my idea.
We check into a really posh hotel near Sabrina.
You two keep an eye on her while I enjoy a vigorous massage with hot mint oil.
Sabrina is leaving tomorrow.
We've got to do something quick.
Let's see what the magic book has under "Good, Clean Fun".
I've never used that chapter.
Here we go.
A Good Clean Fun Consultant.
Hey, kids, what's shaking?
Oh, my gosh!
Frankie Avalon.
I loved you in all those beach movies.
I cried when you and Annette broke up in Beach Blanket Bingo.
And the way you shook your hips in How to Stuff a Wild Bikini made no impression on me whatsoever.
Frankie, I've always wanted to tell you something.
You're swell.
Super swell.
Well, listen, girls girls, I appreciate all your fawning but why, exactly, am I here?
Our niece Sabrina is going to Pelican Cove for spring break.
Pelican Cove?
Cowabunga!
That place is the swingingest.
Is she bringing her board?
No, but she is bringing her boyfriend, Kevin.
Oh, I get the picture.
I got the perfect thing.
Sabrina and Kevin on the beach In the sun All they'll have is some good, clean fun.
Oh, thank you for infusing our lives with wholesomeness.
Say, by the way, what are you and your swinging hips doing later?
Hey!
I saw them first.
Oh, back off.
I saw him first.
I was the first one to see him in his very first movie - I have loved him since Crazy chicks.
All right!
We made it to Pelican Cove.
Let the parties begin.
Woo-hoo!
Is it possible to get sunstroke through tinted glass?
Spellman, it's amazing you pulled this off.
Yeah, you're awesome.
As in awesome, like, travel agent awesome or, like, long term relationship awesome?
Well, let's put it this way.
I'd book all my vacations with you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Josh, take my picture.
Well, hey, why don't I take it of everyone?
Come on, get in before we mutate into crazed party animals.
Ready?
All right.
Wow, check out this retro furniture.
Yeah, it's so Donna Reed meets Don Ho.
I'll get us checked in.
Harvey?
Sabrina.
What are you doing here?
Checking out.
What are you doing here?
Checking in.
Wow, so you look good.
You haven't seen my sunburn.
It's about the same color as your hair.
Which I like.
Thanks.
Hey, Kinkle, in the car.
We gotta hit the road.
I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
It was great seeing you.
Oh!
What's the matter?
We can still hug, can't we?
Of course as soon as I grow a new layer of skin on my back.
See ya.
See ya.
Hey, Red, you're up.
Sorry.
Welcome to the Surfside Motel the number one home of bodacious beach bunnies and all their honeys.
Oh, well, we're the Spellman bunny and honey party.
You came to the right place.
You kids are in for one neat-o week.
Neat-o?
Wait a minute.
Looks like there's some kind of Gidget convention going on here.
Either that or everything in my suitcase is suddenly out of style.
Hey, you guys, where's the party?
Where else, man?
The beach.
Follow us.
We're going to have a swinging time.
Well, you know sometimes a few people at conventions get carried away.
All right, sometimes hundreds of people get carried away.
This is scary.
Yeah, it's like we're in the Twilight Zone.
We'll know for sure if our lifeguard turns out to be Rod Serling.
Hey, you rocking chicks and cats.
Welcome to The Cove.
I'm Beach Doggy and this is Bird Brain.
Yeah, and I'm Bird Brain.
That guy's a buffoon.
When he's that buff you can put up with a lot of "oon".
Shh, I can't hear the dialogue.
We might miss a key story point.
Hey, you guys going to the big bonfire tonight?
We're roasting weenies and making s'mores.
Wow, we don't want to miss that.
Hey, beach bums.
Surf's up.
Last one in's a rotten egg.
That's Tad.
Isn't he dreamy?
Gosh, is he dreamy Did I just say "dreamy"?
Did I just say "gosh"?
Sabrina, I thought that we were supposed to be at the wildest beach in Florida.
Instead, we're hanging out with cats and chicks in super neat-o city.
I've got it.
They're all pod people.
Sabrina, didn't you look at any pictures of this place before you made the reservation?
I swear, when I booked the motel it didn't look anything like this.
Oh, yeah, right.
All of a sudden, it just changed magically.
My aunts are so dead.
It's for you.
Hello?
Aunt Zelda?
You're busted.
Sabrina!
What are you talking about?
Don't play innocent with me.
I know you put a spell in this place because you don't want me to have any fun.
Oh, That is not true.
We do want you to have fun.
Just good, clean fun.
That is so sick.
Well, you know, spell or no spell I'm going to have a spring break so hot it'll melt the plastic sofa in the motel lobby.
You don't think she'll do anything rash, do you?
She's going to make our trip to the Acropolis look like a quilting bee.
Hey, Josh, great news.
Our nightmare is over.
I just booked us two rooms at a major party hotel in Fort Lauderdale.
Okay, well, it's not actually in Fort Lauderdale but it's Everglades adjacent.
Did you hear that?
They're going to a major party hotel.
Finally!
This snoozer's coming alive.
Hildy, would you mind if I sat on your lap for this part?
Eww!
So, come on, guys, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.
Ooh, I don't know, Sabrina.
This place is kind of fun.
I'd just as soon stay here.
You can't be serious.
Why?
Because this retro thing is neato.
No, it's not.
It's like a horrible, evil kind of neat-o.
I know Roxie is not going to go for this.
Uh, she's not only going, she's gone.
Oh, this movie stinks!
I'm calling my cable operator.
Sorry, sweet corn.
I guess the fellas and I got a little too rambunctious.
Let me guess-- you want to stay here, too.
Heck, yeah.
This place is the most.
I just learned how to watusi.
Come on.
Oh, this isn't happening!
Look, we could be on a beach in Fort Lauderdale right now partying like rock stars.
Fort Lauderdale, Pelican Cove-- what's the difference?
I'm with my best girl.
I'd party with you anywhere.
Aw, I'm glad you feel that way, Kevin.
You know, I've been wanting to talk to you.
Swell!
Talk away.
I know we've been dating over a month but I just want to know how you feel about Hey!
Anybody know how to play the guitar?
Yeah, I do.
Swingin'!
Gosh!
You look like Ricky Nelson.
And you look like Dennis the Menace.
Well, like they say-- if all else fails, do the monkey.
Crazy.
Who needs high heels when you can have high hair?
I guess we know who's responsible for depleting the ozone layer.
Yeah, you know, I'd have to admit this '60s thing is kind of keen.
So how about you and Ted?
I know, not only am I dating a surfer but when he says, "Golly," I don't want to hurl.
Yeah.
What is it about this place?
I was all set for some out-of-control partying but for some reason, all I want to do is have Good, clean fun?
Exactly!
So you had a chance to talk to Kevin yet?
No.
Every time I bring up the subject he decides to either give a concert or learn a new dance.
Yeah, his Pelican Stomp is the wiggiest.
Well, tonight at the clam bake I'm going to take him on a romantic moonlit walk and figure out exactly where we are in this relationship.
That is, if I can get my hair through the door.
Hey, Morgan, you want to go hike up to the cliff watch the waves break?
Oh, I can't leave now.
I'm tied for first place in the limbo contest.
Golly!
You sure are cute.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?
Like my arms?
And still, I'm not gagging.
Now, think hard.
Do any of you remember climbing out of a pod?
Well, we've finally got a chance to be alone.
Kevin, can I ask you something?
Sure, but I want to ask you something, too.
You go first.
How do you sleep with that hairdo?
Kevin, we need to talk about our relationship.
I'm not sure how you feel about us.
Well, I'll tell you exactly how I feel.
I like to think about you You like to think about me We're just like birds of a feather 'Cause we're having so much fun together I'm going to kill my aunts for this.
We have fun, it's true In everything we say and do But a girl really needs to know If a guy's just a friend or if he's her beau That's why I like to think about you And you like to think about me Rain or shine, in any kind of weather You and I are having fun Together.
Kevin, that was a blast but not particularly informative.
Hey, look!
Some crazy kids are starting a hula hoop contest!
Let's get lost!
Well, we may not be defining our relationship but at least I know what "hang ten" means now.
Isn't surfing nifty?
The niftiest.
Hey, Josh!
Wow!
That was the living end.
I think I'm ready to surf solo now.
But, Roxie, chicks don't surf.
Why not?
They're just supposed to sit on their guys' board and look good.
Oh, really?
Well, for your information this chick's not a hood ornament.
That's one kooky gal.
Hello, ladies.
You shouldn't expose that lovely skin to the harmful rays of the sun.
If you're interested in sunblock, I'm holding.
Hello, there.
Ow, this isn't hair-- it's the Washington Monument.
Hey, nice parapets.
Thanks.
I work out.
So where's the queen of your castle?
I don't know; Morgan was supposed to meet me here a half hour ago, but I guess she got tied up or lost track of time.
It's a toss-up.
Oh, my gosh!
Dig that crazy chick on the surfboard!
Everybody's gone surfin' Surfin' USA  Wow!
Wow!
I never knew chicks could surf.
We're kooky that way.
Maybe you can sit on my board sometime.
Groovy.
I can't believe we're going home tomorrow.
Me either; I hate the idea of going to physics class Monday morning-- you know, unless I can wear clam diggers.
Yeah, it's been a pretty crazy trip.
I mean, I had fun, but it wasn't exactly how I imagined spring break would be.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You know what I wish?
Oh, no, you're not going to start singing, are you?
Why would I sing?
No reason.
Uh, what were you going to say?
Just that I wish Morgan and I could've spent more time together.
I can relate.
Since we got here, Kevin and I have spent exactly 12 watusi-free seconds alone.
And Morgan always has to be the center of attention and that's not me.
You know, I like just walking along the beach maybe even having an actual conversation.
Yeah, me, too.
Wow, look at that sky.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
And it's nice to have someone to watch it with.
Yeah.
I wish Morgan and I could talk the way you and I do.
Uh maybe we should get back.
Yeah.
Or we could stay here and watch the sunset.
I like your idea better.
It's the end of spring break It hurts to say good-bye It's the end of spring break I think I'm gonna cry Oh Hi.
I Oh, I am having so much fun this week.
Wasn't it great when we went horseback riding on the beach?
Uh, that was you and every guy on the beach but me.
Oh.
So, Roxie, where does this leave you and me?
Well, it leaves you here and I'm catching the next wave out of town.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa We've all had a blast On the surf and the sand We'll be back next year 'Cause our boards don't work on land.
Come on, baby, let's dance the night Sabrina, I just want to tell you that I feel like we've gotten a lot closer this week.
I'm really glad you're my girlfriend.
Hold me tight Girlfriend?
Well, do we have to put labels on our relationship?
Well, no, I guess not.
But maybe we should talk about it.
I was kind of hoping that we could Do the Mashed Potato?
That'd be swell.
What it means to lose contol Rock me, baby It's so easy, let me Show you how it's done You can twist and shout Let's have a little fun You were wrong, Salem.
That movie was adorable.
Well, it's like I always say: There's nothing better than good, clean fun.
Frankie, you're back!
You bet I am.
Come on, girls.
Let's do the swim.
Come on, baby, let's dance the night Rock me, baby We snuggle up close and
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Sabrina, is it my imagination or do you eat more with us now than when you lived here?
Oh well, I couldn't stay away and nobody makes goulash like Aunt Zelda.
The trick is to marinate the ghoul.
Oh, who would be so rude as to send us mail at dinnertime?
It's from cousin Marigold.
She wants to send her daughter Amanda to live with us for a year.
The same Amanda who set our house on fire?
And locked me in a jar?
I'm so out of here.
Wait, Sabrina.
Oh, poor Amanda's worse than ever.
Can a person be worse than pure evil?
This is so sad.
Her mother just got married for the 19th time and Amanda's not taking it well.
That makes two of us.
I'm still trying to bag husband number one.
Marigold thinks if Amanda goes to school in the mortal realm and lives here with us we might be able to straighten her out.
Zelda, this is a huge commitment.
We're going to have to think long and hard before we agree to anything.
No, she can't come.
When's Amanda supposed to be here?
Please let that be an earthquake.
Hi, everybody.
Thank you so, so much for taking me in.
Ooh, what died in here?
That would be our dinner.
I'll order in.
I guess since you're at college I'll be taking over your room.
I think it's going to be really cool once I change everything about it.
Well, that just killed my appetite.
I think it killed everybody's.
Well, not everybody's.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
All right, well, that was fun.
See you in a year.
Honey, we're sorry Amanda's taking over your room but we can't turn our backs on family.
Oh, I wouldn't turn my back on Amanda ever.
We'll make sure she doesn't disturb any of your things.
Thanks for taking care of that.
Salem's right.
The girl's pure evil.
Ooh can I borrow this purse?
Yeah, keep it all.
I'll be sure to write.
Zelda, what are we going to do?
We can't send that little monster to a mortal high school.
Well, maybe we could home school her.
Over my dead body.
Oh, look.
A video.
From Marigold.
How thoughtful.
It's probably 20 years overdue, and she wants us to return it.
Oh, look, there's a note.
"I just met someone on my honeymoon who gave me this.
Try it if you're desperate and frustrated".
That's when I usually rent a video.
Typical suburban teenagers living in a typical suburban home.
Not.
Welcome to Witchright Hall where rebellious and magically challenged young witches learn to function in the mortal realm.
Hot diggety, our troubles are over.
Where children live and go to school under the same roof learning to control their magical impulses and use their powers appropriately.
I've seen enough.
I'll get the checkbook.
- You throw Amanda in the car.
- Wait one minute.
To the neighborhood we're simply a loving couple who adopt delinquent youths.
Oh, my God.
That's James Hexton.
The James Hexton?
Who's James Hexton?
The man whose heart I shattered into a million pieces back in 1469.
Oh, he said he'd never forgive me.
Now I remember.
He waded through a moat of alligators just to see you and you slammed the door in his face.
I see his leg grew back.
This is a disaster.
If you take Amanda to the school for an interview she'll never get in.
He's right.
Someone else will have to take her.
I can't get anybody into school.
Daddy had to donate a fleet of Volkswagens to get me into clown college.
No, no, no, no, no.
On second thought no.
I'll buy you a Porsche.
Keep talking.
Hilda You can't bribe Sabrina into doing the right thing for her family.
Stay out of this.
Give me ten more seconds I'll have her palms so greased she'll need a drip pan.
Listen to me, Sabrina.
Witchright Hall is Amanda's last chance.
If she doesn't get accepted there she'll be banished to the mortal realm forever causing destruction wherever she goes.
Unbelievable.
I am this close to getting a 911 Turbo and you play the apocalypse card.
I am good.
Come on, Amanda, turn that frown upside down.
You're going to love it here.
What do you want?
Why do I care?
Uh, we have an appointment with the headmaster.
Amanda Wickam and her cousin Sabrina.
We're a little early Because everybody hates me and they can't wait to get rid of me.
Well, you sound like a real peach.
Door's open.
Oh, look at this sweet-looking dog.
Here, boy.
First off, I'm old enough to be your grandfather.
Secondly the name is Phil.
Oh, a dog named Phil.
Any relation to a boy named Sue?
Hands off, toots.
I'm not one of your touchy-feely types.
I happen to be the head of the phys ed department.
Now, both of you drop and give me 20.
No way.
I don't go to school here.
Yet.
Okay, let's get a move on, you lard bottoms.
Coming, Coach Phil.
Pathetic bunch.
I know Yorkies who run faster than you.
Well, we know one thing: the phys ed department is solid.
Yeah, I wonder what kind of slobbering animal teaches history?
That would be me.
James Hexton, headmaster.
In a few weeks I should have the slobbering under control.
She didn't mean that.
This is Amanda and I'm her cousin Sabrina.
Delighted.
Oh, um, would you excuse me a minute?
A mob of angry women is about to show up at the door.
This is a decent!
Make that mob of angry men.
I'm so hit and miss today.
Hexton that hormone-crazed son of yours is ruining our daughters' lives.
Oh, Lord, and it's only just 4:00.
All right, back in a jiff.
Well, I for one am loving this place.
Great.
Then you stay here and I'll move in with your roommates at college.
Nicely done.
Oh, I've often practiced that technique myself but I keep coming up against the same obstacle.
Irritable spell syndrome?
I'm mortal.
The only magic I can do involves mascara and Lady Clairol.
Robin Davis, school director.
I'm guessing that feisty little frozen thing is Amanda.
Uh-huh.
I'm her room temperature cousin, Sabrina.
We have an appointment with Professor Hexton.
Oh, you are in for a treat.
The man is a true innovator.
This morning he took his world history class back in time to meet Gandhi.
Really?
Yeah, they learned about passive resistance and then treated the Mahatma to an everything bagel.
Oh, well right now he's on the porch practicing passive resistance on some irate neighbors.
Bet that's going well.
Be right back.
This is a decent place live.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
What seems to be the problem today?
Our daughters are so busy mooning over your boy, Sean they can't eat, sleep or do their homework.
You gotta love me.
Well, I don't think they gotta.
It just plain weird.
It's like he's got all the girls in the neighborhood hypnotized.
Hypnotized?
Let me assure you My husband and I will do everything in our power to squelch whatever magic Sean wields over your daughters.
You know, this town thinks you and your husband are doing a fine thing taking in these screwed-up kids but if you can't control them, be advised: we've got a really testy Kiwanis Club.
Oh, well, let that be a warning to us.
You put some kind of romantic spell on those girls, didn't you?
It seemed to work nicely with the dork spell I put on their boyfriends.
Sean, you can't play around with people's feelings.
Oh, unlike you two, who can play around with the most sacred institution in the mortal realm?
Indian bingo?
You pretend you're married.
For your protection-- to keep away suspicious neighbors.
Working like a charm so far.
Don't you mouth off to us.
I'm sending you up to your room and taking away your magic.
Now, give me the finger.
With pleasure.
You know what I mean.
Very impressive.
Oh, it's been a busy week.
Got fingers coming out of my Don't ask.
Okay, Sabrina.
What do you say we defrost your cousin and get this interview rolling?
Oh, my God, I did it.
No, it was me.
It's always you.
Nice meeting you.
Catch up with you later.
If you'd care to come this way.
Oh, well, when in Rome Well, first off, let's make ourselves comfortable.
Oh, well we're already comfortable.
We felt at home the minute we walked in the door, right, Amanda?
This place bites.
It can.
I wouldn't pet the phys ed teacher.
All right, let's review your file.
Wickam file, Wickam file.
I know I put it somewhere.
Excuse me.
Ah, yes.
Uh, Wickam I believe Yes, here we are.
Let's see.
You've been expelled from 12 different schools.
You forced 14 teachers into early retirement one into a straitjacket.
On the other hand, you were the top seller in the Other Realm High magazine drive.
That's what I love about Amanda-- she's a real go-getter.
It says here you never turned in the money.
That's because I spent it on a mountain bike.
No, wait.
I stole the bike.
I spent the money on a Kate Spade bag.
So Amanda has a problem with dishonesty and greed but that's just because of her troubled background.
I think if you get to know Amanda you will see that she is a good spirit with a kind heart.
Oh!
Ow!
See how quickly she warmed up to you?
I'm so sorry-- I'm sure if I just make a few phone calls, I can get all of Amanda's records.
Not necessary.
I know the type of student I'm dealing with.
Oh, please, Professor there's a lot more to Amanda than meets the eye.
I-I mean, she's very serious about school.
I'll have a banana split two scoops of vanilla, with chocolate sprinkles.
Oh, and, uh get a little something for yourself.
I don't think so.
Well, so much for the interview.
Now, when can you come back for the tour?
Hmm.
Never?
Or now, or sooner, you know.
Whatever works for you.
How about after my faculty meeting?
Oh, Amanda's flexible.
What a kid!
All right, let's begin today's meeting with old business.
Any old business?
Yes, we need equipment for the gym.
We don't have a gym.
We need a gym.
I'll look into it.
Any new business?
I think we should talk about Sean.
He's been wreaking havoc around here for months and, frankly, I don't know if we can turn him around.
Let me handle it.
There's a pack of Rottweilers downtown who owe me.
You want to have a student attacked by a pack of wild dogs?
You make it sound so dirty.
Maybe that's because my approach to education doesn't usually involve drawing blood.
James, he's been bringing the entire neighborhood to our door and jeopardizing the security of the school.
We may have to consider expulsion.
I cannot believe what I am hearing.
Are you telling me you want to just give up on a troubled youth and turn him out on the street?
I'm with the broad.
Dump the chump.
Tough love, baby.
Yeah, well, forgive me if I don't take the advice of someone who scratches himself at the dining room table.
I'm not giving up on Sean.
If the witches had given up on me when I was at correctional school, where would I be today?
Congress?
Do we have any beer nuts?
All right, that's it.
Meeting adjourned.
Robin, why don't you show Sabrina and Amanda around the school.
Then later, I'll have Amanda sit in on my Ethics class.
How can I be of service?
You can clean up the mess you left in the backyard.
Deal.
But I want a new dental plan.
Hi.
You must be Amanda.
Are you a new student here?
I hope not.
You're negative.
I used to be negative.
Now, I just want to make a good impression and have people like me for the positive, uplifting person that I am.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.
Time for class.
Are you sitting in?
Wouldn't miss it.
Great, you can sit right next to me.
The seat is always empty.
What a shock.
Hey, everybody.
Let's give a warm welcome to our guest, Amanda.
I love that outfit.
It's yours.
That's the best you guys can do?
And you call yourselves delinquents?
Ah, I do all right.
The other day, I zapped a third cheek onto Professor Hexton's butt.
You're still doing butt jokes?
That's so second grade.
So, what do you do for fun?
You're looking at the witch who put the hole in the ozone layer.
Wow, I didn't know girls could do stuff like that.
Well, you don't know this girl.
Okay, so here's the plan for today's class.
You-- the minute Hexton starts to talk release the killer bees.
You-- when the mood strikes unleash tornado in a drum.
And stay low.
And you, Smiley salmonella or mad cow disease.
I like them both.
Aren't we going to get in trouble?
Hello, we're witches.
You people have so much to learn.
And I'll be the one teaching them thank you very much.
Now, please take your seats and I'll take those jars.
Well, Miss Wickam You certainly are quite bold for a guest.
I'm just getting warmed up.
Listen to me, dearie.
I've been a witch since the Spanish Inquisition and if Torquemada didn't scare me, you certainly don't.
All right, now, where did we leave off yesterday?
I was telling Sean how I used my magic to hack into the computers at the Pentagon and you were babbling on about something.
Ethics.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Ah, yes, now I remember.
I was about to pose a problem.
Suppose suppose you meet a mortal with whom you're interested in having a relationship.
How would you go about that?
Sam.
Well, I'd use a mind-reading spell to amass data from her brain and then photographically memorize her interests.
News flash, dude.
You're photographing the wrong stuff.
Yes, just the person you want to listen to.
The only way he can get a girl to like him is to put a spell on her.
Now, can anyone tell me what's wrong with what Sean did?
He got caught.
Hmm oh, yes, he did and now his magic finger lives in this jar with a toe.
Can't explain.
All right, now, listen up, people.
Here's the deal.
You can't find a relationship in a potion bottle.
Oh, sure, you can manipulate people but real friendship, true love-- they need more than magic to survive.
They need human emotion.
What makes you such an expert?
Well, I wouldn't exactly call myself an expert but I do have some good friends and I did know true love once.
Hmm.
It was the summer of '69 one of his backyard barbecues.
Suddenly, I looked up and saw a vision due west of a suckling pig.
She was beautiful.
Hmm she was brilliant and for a brief moment in time, she was mine.
What happened?
Ah, she left me for that studmuffin, Gutenberg.
Ah, big deal.
So the guy printed a bible.
It's not like he wrote the blasted thing.
Sorry.
Well, maybe if you'd used magic you would have stayed together.
Ah, but it wouldn't have been the same, would it?
Because I'd already experienced real magic-- that all-consuming passion that comes from within.
That's the most romantic story I've ever heard but if anybody ever dumps me for a bible maker they're toast.
So, are you saying a guy like me can get a girl without using any magic?
I did.
But she, like, totally broke your heart.
Hmm.
Letting me know I had one.
Now, why don't you see if you can find yours.
All right, people, I'm going to let you ponder these matters for a while while I take these jars to the landfill.
Carry on.
Okay, Amanda, what else you got in that magic bag?
Everything from cold sores to cold wars.
Cool.
Let me be the first to say you'd be a real asset to this school.
And you can help me with the yearbook.
We still have a number of applications to review before we fill the space, but we'll call you as soon as we make our decision.
Okay, well, we'll be waiting by the phone or the toaster, you know, whichever's quicker.
All right, let me have it-- you hate this place, right?
I don't know, it beats living with stepfather number 19.
Amanda, that is the most positive thing you've ever said.
You must really like it here.
Well, it's the first place I ever felt I belonged.
If you get accepted here, you don't have to be shuttled back and forth from realm to realm.
I mean, you could really find some stability here and turn your life around.
Yeah, it all sounds good but I learned a long time ago not to get my hopes up.
I'll put in a good word for you but it may not carry much weight-- I'm an umbrella.
What's taking so long?
Why haven't they called yet?
When they do, can I answer the phone?
I want to hear James's voice one more time.
Amanda really liked the place.
I sure hope she gets in.
That makes four of us.
Five of us.
Hello.
Hi, hi, Professor Hexton.
So?
No?
Oh!
Oh, say it ain't so!
But she was so I see but Amanda really liked Okay thanks, anyway.
I don't believe this.
You?
We're the ones who are going to be stuck living with her.
Did they give you any explanation as to why they didn't accept Amanda?
No, but they're going to.
Is it okay if I go to Compumart to look at hard drives?
Well, after you clear your place.
The right way, please.
I caught the end of your lecture today.
It was very moving.
Oh, thanks.
Do you think it had any effect on the kids?
Well, I know it made me look at things a bit differently.
Do you think that you could ever love that way again?
Well, I suppose it's possible.
I can't believe you rejected my cousin, Amanda.
If she's not right for this nuthouse, who is?
Hillary Kursburg.
Thanks to her the Cubs haven't won a World Series since 1908.
We take only the most extreme cases.
At the end of the day we felt that Amanda just wasn't as troubled a soul.
She's a nightmare!
She's a spoiled, selfish little brat who's been nothing but trouble since the day she was born.
We thought she was rather nice.
Actually, that's the main reason we rejected her.
Well, you saw the well-behaved Amanda.
Want to see the real Amanda?
Watch what happens when she finds out she didn't get accepted.
She's going to go ballistic.
Anything?
Did the school call?
Yes, sweetheart.
Well, did I get in?
In your dreams, sweetheart.
Nasty cat.
Oh, you think he's bad.
Keep watching Ten to one says she blows up the house.
She's crying!
Tears of rage, I assure you.
I really liked it there.
I mean, it's the first place that ever felt like home.
Amazing!
Amanda's the first student ever to cry because she didn't get accepted.
Normally, they cry because they do.
She can change, I promise!
No, that won't be necessary.
Any witch who's that desperate to be here deserves a place.
You mean, you'll accept her?
What about the Kursburg girl?
Oh, she's small.
We can squeeze her in.
How soon can you have Amanda here?
Oh, sooner than you can imagine.
Just so we're clear I'm not sharing a room with anybody.
I'll get it.
Well, hello.
Hi, my name's Tiffany.
I'm selling raffle tickets for my church.
They're only a dollar.
Are you interested?
I'm interested.
I'll take five tickets.
I guess we'll see if he learned anything in class.
I don't see why a guy who looks like that even needs magic.
Thank you very much.
No, thank you.
If you want a kiss, I need dinner and a movie.
Where's the girl?
In your sick little mind.
Now give me 50 laps and take a cold shower.
And I'm keeping the five smackeroos.
Man Well, I can't say I like your tactics very much but you made your point.
However, I refuse to give up on Sean.
Hexton, you're softer than a chewed-up slipper.
Which reminds me, my gums are killing me.
How about that dental plan?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Spellman, this has got to stop.
This is the third night you've woken me up because you can't sleep.
Well, third night's the charm.
Look, something's obviously bothering you.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just can't sleep.
I know the feeling.
I'll be on the couch.
And don't tell me nothing's wrong.
You've been in a funk for a week.
Even your perkiness has lost its pop.
That is so not true.
I'm at the popping peak of my perkiness.
I'm totally funkless.
Absolutely nothing is bothering me.
Okay, now something's bothering me.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
How's the car coming?
Is it supposed to sound like that?
No, it's not supposed to sound like that.
I'm afraid the Zeldamobile is dead.
It can't be.
She was fine yesterday when I drove her to the Piggly Wiggly.
I'm telling you, there's nothing more I can do.
It's time to pull the plug and buy a new car.
Well, I can't do that.
Hilda's not back from her singles' cruise for another week, and I've never bought a car by myself before.
There was a time you'd never been blonde before but you gave that a shot.
Hi.
Notice anything different about me?
Not only is your car dead but your niece needs a smog check.
You poor dear.
I had no idea you were so upset.
Why does everyone keep assuming I'm upset?
I'm just a little damp.
Sabrina, you have a black cloud over your head.
That only happens when a witch is in a funk and keeping it all bottled up.
We're a very literal species.
Let's hope I never become a bleeding-heart liberal.
Is this about Kevin?
No.
School?
School's fine.
Kevin and I are ancient history and that's totally okay.
If you don't mind I'd like to take a look and see what your little cloud is made of.
Hmm, that's funny.
I'm seeing a lot of sadness over your breakup with Kevin-- lingering feelings for Harvey-- conflicted emotions about Josh-- and you're clearly overwhelmed with schoolwork.
Not even.
Sometimes it just feels like I'm being pulled in so many different directions.
You know, like everyone expects me to be perfect all the time.
Now, the only person who expects you to be perfect is you.
We all love you no matter what.
Thank you, Aunt Zelda.
And you see?
Just by getting it off your chest your little black cloud is gone.
But what if it comes back?
I don't want to be depressed again.
And the wet look is totally dead.
Well, Sabrina, the only way to be sure that a black cloud won't return is to get out of yourself.
Do something that's truly for others.
Like what?
Well, you could help me shop for a used car.
Oh, I don't want to set my sights too high.
Maybe I'll start with bathing lepers and work my way up.
Hey, did anybody see this?
I'm thinking of going to the big protest rally this afternoon at the Mayflower Apartments.
Ooh, yeah, I heard about that.
They want to tear down that old historic building.
and make way for a new parking structure.
I am so there.
I've been to tons of demonstrations and I don't mean to get all braggy but I've actually been arrested twice.
Once with Martin Sheen.
Wow.
A few more arrests and you'll be qualified to be president.
Well, you can definitely count me in.
Really?
!
Really?
!
Really?
!
Absolutely.
If there's one thing this university needs is more parking.
Morgan, the protest is to save the building and stop the parking structure.
Oh.
Have a nice time.
Josh and I are going to stay here and snuggle on the couch.
Actually, I'd like to go to the rally.
The Mayflower's architecture's pretty amazing.
I'd love to get some photographs before they level the place.
Crumbling bricks over taut flesh.
Good choice.
Miles, how about you?
Challenging authority, public insurrection general mayhem?
I'm all over it.
Hey, this is our first group act of civil disobedience.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo?
That'll go over great at the protest.
All we are saying is give "Whoo-hoo" a chance.
Salem?
I did it.
I found the perfect car at the first dealer.
It's blue.
The leather is practically new and it has the most darling cup holders.
Cup holders?
What about the mileage?
The tread on the tires?
Has the car ever been in an accident?
I didn't think to ask.
But there's a lighted makeup mirror on both visors.
Never send a woman to do a cat's job.
: Hello.
Yes, this is Mr. Spellman.
My wife hasn't made up her mind yet.
What are you doing?
I know she said she liked the car but I can't let her take it at that price.
Salem, give me that phone.
Let's just say she's a lot more competent in the boudoir than she is under the hood.
Hello, this is Mrs. Spellman.
I'm afraid I'll have to call you back.
I'm about to become a widow.
I told you I can handle this.
Oh, yeah?
Then why did Mr. let's-make-a-deal immediately give me $500 off?
What?
!
He said that price was firm.
What makes him think he can take advantage of me?
You're a rube?
: Save the Mayflower.
Save the Mayflower.
Save the Mayflower.
Save the Mayflower.
This is just what I needed.
I am totally out of my funk.
I haven't even thought about my tragic breakup my grades, my lack of direction Okay, well, not as much as I was before.
Hey, save the Mayflower.
This is so morally gratifying.
And I'm getting a fairly decent upper body workout.
It's a wonderful thing you kids are doing here.
Have some lemonade.
Oh, it's nothing, you know.
We're just holding up a few signs raising a little awareness.
Listen, Lawman, before you break out the K-9 units and water cannon, may I remind you that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution clearly states that we have a right for free assembly.
Aw, geez.
Rox, give it a rest, would you?
Officer Carmichael?
Yeah.
I didn't recognize you.
You lose some weight?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm on The Zone.
You know, I missed you at the No Nukes rally.
I Had a Save The Whales brunch.
You know, these cornices are one of the best examples of Romanesque revival in the city.
Yeah.
We tried to get them declared a historical landmark but we didn't make the cut.
And now, we've got 30 days to pack up and move out.
That's terrible.
Are a lot of young families going to be displaced by the parking lot?
Half the tenant are families with kids.
And the other half are seniors.
I've been living here for 50 years.
Married my husband right there on this stoop.
Divorced him in the laundry room.
I don't know how we're going to find a place to live.
So they're not just knocking down a building-- they're destroying people's lives.
Look, maybe it's not over yet.
Maybe this protest will really do some good.
You're an optimistic little firecracker, aren't you?
We'd hoped the protest would attract some media attention.
But so far, none of the newspapers or TV stations have returned our calls.
Hey, I'm the media.
I could write a piece for the Adams' paper then word would spread and people would learn about your plight and the university wouldn't dare throw you out in the street.
Well, that's very sweet of you.
Now get your little heinie out of my flower bed.
You're killing my petunias.
I had a feeling you'd be back.
That car's just calling out your name.
I know, I just love.
Meow.
cars.
A subject I know quite a lot about.
I can see that.
Well, like I told your husband I can give it to you for 11 thou.
Well, that seems like a very good price.
Meow!
Uh, if I hadn't noticed the excessive wear on the tires and the shoddy repair work to the fender.
Why, I wouldn't give you a penny over $9,000.
You're a pretty tough little negotiator.
What say I throw in some brand-new tires shave off a few bucks for the fender and I give it to you for $10,500.
That seems like a very reasonable compromise.
Meow!
Oh, hush up, kitty.
Where do I sign?
Ow!
Would you excuse me for a moment?
What are you doing?
!
Can't you see?
He's ripping you off.
He seems like a perfectly honest man.
Yeah, and I don't use your toothbrush to clean my ears.
That's disgusting.
I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to do a little comparison shopping.
I really love your angle-- "People Before Parking".
It's inspired.
Of course, no one ever stands up for the people who need parking.
Hey.
Hi.
You don't think it's too sentimental?
Not at all.
You know I got to say, I'm really impressed.
Most people our age are too self-absorbed to get this involved.
Not only do you care, you put it in print.
As much as I also care about people I've never met we have a 7:30 dinner reservation.
I wonder if this is why Ralph Nader stayed single.
One look at his suits will tell you why.
Come on.
Okay, well, have fun and don't eat any endangered species.
Hey, let me know if you need any help.
I don't think I'm the one that needs the help.
Blue days, all of them gone Nothing but blue skies from now on.
I think I liked you better when you were depressed.
Look, there's Dean Pitchford.
He's the one in charge of the demolition of the Mayflower.
Hi, Dean Pitchford.
I'm Sabrina Spellman.
Oh, yes, our resident instigator.
Well, thanks to your article I had a sleepless night fielding phone calls from parents and trustees.
Maybe you'd sleep better if you did what was right and kept those tenants in their homes.
Or, you know, you could just screen your calls.
Well, thanks.
But I won't have to worry about my phone ringing anymore.
The Board of Trustees just had an emergency meeting and resolved the problem.
Well, that's great.
Wait a minute.
How exactly did you resolve it?
Hi, Mrs. Smiley, I'm so glad you're here.
I just saw the Dean and he said the Board resolved the problem but he didn't say how.
Well, apparently your article really put a fire under him.
That's great.
You must be so happy.
We don't have time to be happy.
Now they say we have to packed up and out of here by next week.
Sabrina, stop beating yourself up about this.
Nobody's blaming you.
Yeah, but if I hadn't written that article They were going to be evicted anyway.
Just not quite this soon.
Wow.
Somebody sure has a black cloud over her head.
What?
Oh, I can explain.
Uh, it's just a weird atmospheric convergence There's no cloud over my head.
No, it's something we native English-speakers call "just an expression".
Sabrina's upset because they're evicting everyone at the Mayflower.
That's awful!
And you worked so hard on your little article.
I think that somebody needs to treat herself to a new pair of shoes.
Seriously.
How could the dean and the board of trustees hear about those people and still be so cold-hearted?
Most people don't react to things like you and I do, Sabrina.
That's because, to the normal world, these people are just faceless strangers.
Well, maybe if they saw the faces of those tenants they wouldn't be so apathetic.
Faces Of course.
You just gave me an idea, Spellman.
How's this?
Hot off the laser printer.
I also took the liberty of airbrushing Mrs. Smiley's mole.
Oh, these photos are perfect.
When people see these faces, they're going to know how important this cause is.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Great!
All right!
We'll see you tomorrow at 3:00.
All right, Channel Six is coming to our protest.
Woo-hoo!
No way!
That's fantastic!
I'm sorry, am I missing something?
Oh, great news.
Tomorrow, we are holding the biggest demonstration that has ever been held at Adams College and three news crews are coming.
And a reporter from the Boston Globe.
A dozen posters, ready to go.
Ooh.
The guy at Kinko's was so moved he gave me free collating for the rest of my life.
Wow, these are perfect.
Okay, we still got a ton of things to organize.
We got to plaster these up all over campus.
Well, I can be in charge of that.
You want to help me, honey?
Josh, I hate to drop a reality bomb on this little do-gooder convention but we have plans tonight.
We're going to the opening of that new club, the Trocadero.
Oh, man, I totally forgot.
Maybe you could plaster one of these up while you're there.
Oh, no can do.
The only place Josh's hands are going to be are on me.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to cancel.
What?
!
I-I bought a new dress I told everybody that we're coming and I pulled major strings to get us in.
Morgan, these people are about to lose their homes.
I think that's a little more important than seeing you and your friends dressed in Saran Wrap yet again.
Do you really wear Saran Wrap?
It's pleather.
Josh, you can't just dismiss me.
We promised each other that if we had a disagreement we would at least discuss it.
Well, your idea of discussing it means I change my mind.
And it's been working so well for us.
Well, it's not working this time.
I'm going with Sabrina.
Of course you are.
Sabrina says jump and suddenly you're slapping flyers all over a school you don't even go to.
So on a scale from one to ten how uncomfortable do you feel right now?
Very comfortable.
Feels just like home.
You know, I understand if you want to be with Morgan.
No, no, I want to be with you.
I mean, here, working on this, with you.
I have had it.
I have been to every used car lot on the eastern seaboard.
One more toupee-wearing, polyester-clad salesman calls me "little lady" You're worries are over, little lad-ya.
I've come across a couple of beauties that I think will be perfect for you.
A '72 Oldsmobile?
!
Salem, that thing's a land yacht.
Well, as you fade into your golden years you may find yourself spreading a little and you'll want a nice bench seat.
This is ridiculous!
I am going to get that little blue car we saw yesterday.
Fine.
Get the car.
But since I'm the one maintaining it at least let me look under the hood.
All right.
But for goodness sake, this time could you try to be a little more discreet?
How does it look?
Water pump's new but it looks like the cylinder head might be loose.
I wish I had a wrench!
Well, little lady have I got good news for you.
I talked to my manager he has agreed to your $9,000 offer.
Well, that's wonderful.
Let's go sign the papers.
I'll be there in just a sec.
Salem, he's going to meet our price.
Oh!
I'm stuck!
Oh, is there a problem?
Um, no, it's just that well my cat is stuck.
I can see that.
But don't you worry, we'll take him out of there.
And if anything goes wrong then we'll just get you a new cat any color you'd like.
PROTESTERS : People before parking!
People before parking!
Spellman, you rock.
This is so much better than the genetically-engineered corn rally I can't even tell you.
Thanks.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
What's with the new jewelry?
It's not really a protest unless I chain myself to something.
We all have our little traditions.
Hey, Miles, have you seen Josh?
He's supposed to be corraling the news crews.
No, I haven't.
But I have made an amazing discovery.
Chicks dig social revolutionaries.
Down with The Man!
Hey, Sabrina, we've got problems.
Josh, what's the matter?
Where are the news crews?
They're all covering a breaking story.
Apparently it's the biggest thing since Baby Jessica.
Paramedics are standing by as firefighters work tirelessly to free the terrified feline.
We'll keep you updated as this tragic situation unfolds.
Meanwhile, let's see if we can get a comment from the grief-stricken owner.
Oh, really, he's fine.
So you're saying you could just throw me over your shoulder?
Gotta go.
Here.
Well, he's truly like a member of the family.
Sure.
Hey, Aunt Zelda.
What are you doing?
You're totally Bogarting my coverage.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't use my magic with all these people watching.
I have an idea-- Do you think you can keep everyone's attention on you for a minute?
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.
Salem, you're ruining my protest.
Yeah?
Like I planned on waving my butt on national television!
Can't you just suck it in a little?
I am!
I got to cut back on the nachos.
On the plus side, I am now a celebrity.
No, your butt's a celebrity.
Not the first time.
We'll have to get the Jaws of Life!
It'll take a couple hours!
I don't have a couple of hours.
Is he all right?
Are there any missing limbs?
Oh, he's fine.
No harm done until we get home.
Cut.
Let's pack it in.
Hey, did you know the students are storming the administration building over at Adams?
Well, it's not a cat stuck in an engine block, but it's better than nothing-- Let's go; let's roll.
So shall we go sign the papers?
Absolutely.
But there's one slight problem.
Your cat seems to have done some damage while he was stuck in there.
I would say $2,000 worth?
So we're back to the original asking price.
Right you are, little lady.
Well, in that case, I'd like to trade in my cat.
Do you have a '97 calico with low mileage?
We're reporting live from Adams College where administrators are planning on turning 50 residents of the Mayflower Apartments out onto the cold streets of Boston.
Excuse me!
May I have your attention?
People before parking!
Please!
May I please have your attention?
Quiet down.
Let the man speak.
After careful consideration of the plight of the Mayflower residents which was, fortunately, brought to our attention Adams College is prepared to compensate the tenants by providing housing in the Candor Arms a new residential community on the other side of the campus.
You call that compensation?
How can you insult these people by asking them to move from their beloved homes into pre-fab cardboard boxes?
Yeah!
Do these pre-fab cardboard boxes have washers and dryers in each unit?
You bet.
And dishwashers?
Yes, sir.
How are appliances supposed to compare to a lifetime of memories?
Compared to my memories, they win hands down.
When do we move?
Ah, that's the spirit!
Aw, what's the matter?
Post-protest blues?
I guess.
You know the university is still going to tear down that building.
I just feel like we settled.
Sabrina, this wasn't about a building, it was about people-- you said so yourself.
And they're happy.
I don't think they feel like they're settling.
You did a good thing.
You really think so?
Yeah, I do.
You're pretty amazing.
Sabrina Sabrina, I just want to tell you how wonderful this all is.
Thanks to you and your boyfriend, I got a new home.
Oh, well, I'm glad it all worked out.
And he's not my boyfriend.
He already has a girlfriend.
Well, actually, not anymore.
Morgan and I broke up this morning.
What?
Really?
Oh, Josh, I'm so sorry.
No, she's not.
It's really over this time.
He had his mind made up.
Nothing that I could say or wear was gonna change it.
I'm sorry, Morgan.
I know how much you cared about him.
I did.
But in the end, I guess I was just too much woman for him.
You know, I really think that he would rather be with someone like you.
Really?
Did he did he say that?
I mean, did he actually mention me by name?
I didn't say you, I said someone like you.
Oh.
Right.
Oh, I just I don't know what I'm going to do, Sabrina.
I just feel so depressed.
All I could say is, you got to get out of yourself.
You know, you got to focus all your energies on something positive.
Yeah, that's excellent advice but I think I'll just stay with my own tried and true method.
Hi, Dave!
I'm all ready.
Bye.
Now why didn't I think of that?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hello?
Hello?
That's weird.
They hung up.
That's the second time that's happened today.
Did you hear a cell door clanging in the background?
No.
Then it wasn't my mom.
Hey, look, I found an old box of macaroni for dinner.
Whoa, whoa-- let me see the expiration date on that.
I think it's in Roman numerals.
Have anything better?
Tater tots A freezer-burned pot pie and a UFO-- unidentified foil object.
Do you realize, in the '50s they thought this was a well-balanced meal?
Well, in the '50s they also thought that hiding underneath your desk could save you from a nuclear attack.
That only works if the desk is 80 feet underground and made of a titanium alloy.
And speaking of nuclear fallout I survived another dinner with my parents.
Ooh, and saved us from fossilized macaroni.
Hand over the leftovers.
The entire evening was a nightmare.
They maligned every aspect of my character and my life.
That's awful.
Oh, your mom put raisins in the kugel.
I don't even know why I continue going.
These Sunday night dinners are becoming a sadistic ritual.
It's important to have family traditions.
Do you taste this kishka?
It's to die for.
It's the same thing every time I go home.
My father hoks me about forgetting this paranormal nonsense and switching my major to accounting while my mother shovels food into my plate and says "Why don't you come home more often"?
It wouldn't hurt.
You'd think my father would realize I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than join the family business.
Well, what are you saying?
That there's no room for a paranormal researcher at a CPA firm?
That's about as good as my father's latest joke-- changing the company name to Goodman, Goodman and Not So Goodman.
That's funny.
Or cruel.
You know, depends on your point of view.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
For your next astronomy paper you're free to choose your own topic.
It should be double-spaced, ten pages.
Due next week, and no there is no bonus assignment for extra credit.
Never hurts to ask.
This should be a breeze.
I can spit out ten pages just downloading NASA's website.
And one other thing-- No downloading NASA's website or any other scientific mumbo jumbo that you get off the Internet.
I want it totally understandable.
Simple.
In layman's terms.
Which is why you'll be presenting it orally to the class.
I don't believe this.
First we can't download our reports.
Then she expects us to actually understand them.
What kind of wacko approach to teaching is this, anyway?
This is quite a quandary.
You have to intelligently discuss a complicated topic yet it has to be understandable to the lowest common denominator.
How do we do that?
I just thought of a way.
Is Aunt Hilda here?
I got to run my astronomy report by her.
You want to talk to Hilda about science?
Dear, that's like asking Hirohito where to get a good pizza.
I, on the other hand, have three doctorates in intergalactic studies and am personally credited with discovering 17 moons.
Well, my professor says that my report has to be so clear that even the simplest person can understand it.
Better wait for Hilda.
She's on a date with a witch from Venus.
She met him through that dating service-- Great Hexpectations.
What is all this?
Oh, extra food Miles brought home from dinner with his family.
They torture him about becoming an accountant but send him home with gold.
This looks unusual.
Ugh.
And not unlike my Uncle Goliath's kidney stone.
It's matzo ball soup.
So good you just want to say, "Oy".
That's Yiddish for "Yum".
Oy.
That was the most incredible experience of my life.
So Elliot was nice?
Beats me.
I was talking about his car.
That thing really flies.
Literally-- he's got a flying car, Zellie.
UFO!
It looks just like a Cadillac.
So, tell us about your date.
Give us details.
It's a 1,000-cylinder, hydrogen-fueled turbo with the coolest chrome fins on the afterburners.
Oh.
You mean Elliot.
Well, let me just say this.
It's true what they say about men from Venus.
They have great suspension.
As opposed to those cads from Mars who leave the toilet seat up and drink out of the milk carton.
I did it once.
Let it go.
Well, now that we've got a report on your date and his car I want to run my astronomy report by you.
Of course.
See-- you're not the only one Sabrina values for her intelligence.
Shoot.
"The speed of light is the speed at which light travels" Whoa whoa hoa.
Back up, Einstein-- you lost me.
Maybe I should just give my report with finger puppets.
Oh, I love finger puppets.
So, you ready to give your presentation?
Actually, I'm ready to give two presentations.
One is my standard ten-minute cocktail party icebreaker about the molecular composition of sunspots.
The other is really going out on a limb.
I better go with the safe choice.
Safe choice?
That doesn't sound like you.
Then I know I'm on the right track.
Miles come on, you got to go out on a limb.
I mean, that's what I love about you.
You're not afraid to take risks.
Really?
Yeah, I mean look at what you're wearing.
"Therefore, it is hypothesized "that quasars are optical illusions "created by gravitational lensing "of the photons emanating from a large mass at the center of an active galaxy.
The end".
Wow.
Who knew you could deliver a ten-page report without ever taking a breath?
Although, towards the end, the lack of oxygen was causing your left eye to wander.
I'm just happy it's over and I never have to think about quasars again.
Thank you, Roxie, or should I be thanking your Internet service provider?
Sabrina, you're next.
Uh My report is on the speed of light.
The speed of light is fast.
It's really fast.
Like, you know how the cheetah's, like the fastest land animal.
It's, like, way, way, way, way, way faster than that.
You said to keep it simple.
I was all set to present my report on sunspots including my hypothesis that the disco era was influenced by a minor solar flare but then, a good friend convinced me to go out on a limb.
Last night I, Miles Goodman witnessed an alien spacecraft traverse the night sky.
Oy.
Not in the "yum" sense of the word.
Surprisingly, it looked like a Cadillac yet it was stylishly adorned with chrome fins on the afterburners.
Why can't Aunt Hilda take the bus like everyone else?
It was incredible.
There it flew, flashing a red light that I can only interpret as a left turn signal.
I got another interpretation-- you're a nut job.
I know what I saw.
I-I-It was a flying car.
Or maybe it was a rubber-padded spaceship coming to take you away.
I'm sure it wasn't a medical vehicle, because there weren't any international markings for Red Cross.
You're so loopy, Goodman.
Maybe what you saw looked like a spacecraft but was really a weather balloon.
Afterburners on a weather balloon?
Now who's loopy?
Still you.
Aunt Hilda, we need to talk.
Nothing good ever comes after that sentence.
Miles saw your boyfriend's flying car.
See?
He gave a report on it in Astronomy, and was totally humiliated.
I had to cover with some stupid story about a weather balloon.
You called a top-of-the-line fully loaded Venusian cruiser a weather balloon?
Look, the point is, if you're going to date people from other planets you have to be discreet.
Isn't that what I've always taught you?
Wait a minute, that's what you've always taught me.
I'm sorry.
I just got carried away.
I've just never dated a guy with such cool wheels before.
Aunt Hilda, you dated the guy who invented the wheel.
Oh, Miles.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, yes, but make it quick.
I'm the target of mass mockery and unless I'm fast on my feet I may inadvertently get pantsed.
Well, this won't take long.
I wanted to ask you for the recipe to your mother's delectable matzo ball soup.
I'd like to help you, but my mother swore she's taking it to her grave along with my bubee Esther's antique brooch which I interpret as a direct slap to my Aunt Ceil.
Oh, but I must have that recipe.
Surely you could get it for me.
Believe me, Zelda, I would do anything for you but my mother keeps that secret recipe in her girdle drawer and no one goes in there.
Unfortunately not even my mother.
I'm really glad you decided to go out with me again.
I I wasn't sure that you liked me.
Don't be ridiculous, Elliot.
I'm very fond of you.
Now, where's the turbo?
I don't think that you're ready for that yet.
Besides, I think we should wait until we reach a less congested area to kick it in.
Or we could kick it in now and get out of this congestion faster.
I know-- "Driving is a privilege.
Safety first".
Blah, blah, blah.
Hilda, I'm beginning to think the only reason you're going out with me is because you like my vehicle.
That's not true.
I think you're a very sweet, sensitive guy and I'm lucky to have found you.
I feel the same way about you.
I can't believe I have to redo my report.
Sure, it was a little factoid heavy but I didn't go off like a crazy person about a flying Cadillac taking the carpool lane to Pluto.
Miles isn't crazy.
Yes, he is, and I'll tell you who's even crazier: his good friend who told him he should make a fool of himself.
His good friend had the best of intentions.
I'm just guessing.
Hello?
Hello?
Another hang up.
This is getting a little freaky.
I mean if the lights go out, and someone walks in here with a knife That's the best reaction I've had all day.
Sorry, we thought you were the psychotic hang up caller.
Yeah I wish.
Professor Hutchins just called me on the carpet.
She said, "Science has nothing to do with little green men in souped-up spaceships".
Then she said I'm "an embarrassment to the Paranormal Studies program".
What's embarrassing is there is a Paranormal Studies program.
The point is that when the head of the Paranormal Department calls you a freaking fruitcake it's time to reevaluate the rest of your life.
Miles, you're not crazy.
You're just as sane as anyone.
That's not much comfort coming from you.
You're the one who told me to go out on a limb and then told the class I saw a weather balloon.
I was just trying to come up with a more plausible explanation.
Then other words I'm a freaking fruitcake.
Miles, I didn't say that.
Do you or do you not believe that I saw a spaceship-- yes or no?
Well I believe that you think you saw one.
So you think I'm delusional?
No, I just think there are millions of possibilities.
No, there's only one.
I'm going to forget all this paranormal nonsense and become an accountant.
Miles, you can't do that.
Watch me.
My father will finally get his wish.
From now on, it's going to be Goodman, Goodman and Goodman.
Oy.
I can't believe Miles decided to be an accountant.
He's always wanted to be a paranormal researcher all of his life.
I mean, even as a toddler, he was convinced that Bert and Ernie were visitors from another planet.
I just wish those two would come out and put that rumor to rest.
Look, Sabrina I think this Miles thing is good news for you.
Now he won't be nosing around looking for supernatural phenomena and you won't have to worry about being exposed as a witch.
No, I just have to worry about having killed a man's spirit.
Oh, please, who hasn't done that?
I just wish I could have looked Miles in the eyes and told him that I know he saw that spacecraft.
Then maybe he'd still be following his dream.
Sabrina, you had no choice.
You couldn't tell Miles the truth.
Just like I can't tell Elliot I'm only dating him for his big block.
What?
It's an engine.
Hey, great news.
I just sold my freshman accounting books to Goodman.
That's horrible.
Not for me.
And, frankly, changing his major's the best decision Miles ever made.
Having your dreams crushed is your idea of a good time?
Let me guess-- in Peter Pan, when Tinkerbell dies you're the only guy not clapping to bring her back to life.
That little fairy drove me nuts.
Sabrina, you have to look at it from a pragmatic point of view.
There's not a lot of job opportunities for guys with a BS in UFOs.
That's true.
On career day, you rarely see a paranormal recruiting booth.
And better Miles comes to this realization now rather than spending $80,000 on an education he'll never use.
I guess you're right.
College is a time that should be spent doing the thing that prepares you for your life ahead.
We're out of toilet paper in the men's room.
I'm on it.
Hello?
Hello?
This is really getting old.
Not unlike this kugel.
It just doesn't keep like the kishke.
So, Miles, you seem to really be getting into those accounting books.
You got to love debits and credits.
They're all perfectly logical and spelled out in black and red.
Don't you miss the thrill of the unexplainable?
What I don't miss is the pain of being ridiculed.
When you tell people you see a seven, they believe you instead of calling you a nut job.
You know, Miles, I know what you're going through.
I mean, I know what it's like to have people think you're different.
Yeah right, what would you know about being different?
Well, there happens to be a lot about me that you don't know.
Like?
Like I tend to talk too much about myself.
Back to you.
Face it, Sabrina you know nothing about being different.
You're just a nice, normal, well-adjusted person.
Look, knock it off, psycho!
I don't have time for your Oh, sorry.
Miles, it's Garth.
He wants to know if you want to go to the Sci-Fi Club screening of Blade Runner tonight.
Tell him I'm busy.
He says they're going to watch it backwards and look for hidden meaning.
Sorry, Garth, but I'm joining the real world.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I mean, you used to really enjoy going out with those Freaks?
Sabrina, I know I've made the right decision.
I can definitely see myself being an accountant for the next 50 years.
workday plan.
Well, maybe you can, but I can't.
Wait a minute, of course I can.
Uh Prove me wrong and allay my fears Show me Miles in 15 years.
Here's your tax return, Mr. Willoughby and you'll be happy to know I was able to write off your entire safari to Africa.
And, if the Feds ever ask Mr. G. Raffe and Mr. L. E. Phant are your Serengeti sales reps.
Miles, you're a genius.
You saved me again.
Well, it's easy when you do what you love.
Great, I was wrong!
Miles is happy being an accountant.
And why not?
I mean, he's successful, he's got a nice office big desk, picture of the wife and kids Is that Roxie?
Just need your John Hancock on this.
Will you excuse me?
Sure.
Sorry to barge in but I can't let you ruin your life.
Sabrina, my life is just beginning-- a new life enriched with the joy of long-form deductions.
No, you're going to hate deductions.
They are going to make you miserable.
I know this for a fact.
How do you know-- what'd you do?
Look into a crystal ball and see my future?
Something like that.
Look, part of being Miles Goodman is you know collecting stuff like this.
Radioactive isotope from a Russian warhead.
Oh, are you insane?
Yes, you are.
And that is my point.
See, anyone that collects stuff like this is not meant to be an accountant.
That's why I'm giving it away.
By the way, I'd wash my hands if I were you.
Several thousand times.
Dipotassium phosphate.
Dipotassium phosphate.
Sodium silicaluminate.
Sodium silicaluminate.
And schmaltz.
Schmaltz.
This should do it.
Voila!
If my calculations are right I will have just replicated the exact molecular structure of Mrs. Goodman's matzo balls.
Prepare yourself for gastronomic nirvana.
Brelch!
if this is nirvana, I'm Hadassah Lieberman.
Oh, Sabrina, good, you're here.
I need a second opinion.
Try this.
What do you think?
Make them smaller, have Tiger Woods autograph them and you've got the hottest seller at the PGA tour.
I don't understand what went wrong.
This matzo ball is a chemically perfect clone.
Zelly, you're missing one key ingredient.
What?
Something I learned about in my little village of Anatevka-- love.
Okay, before he breaks out in a chorus of "Sunrise, Sunset," I need to talk to you about Miles.
If only I could tell him I know he saw that spacecraft he'd give up this crazy idea of being an accountant.
But you can't tell him.
That would be admitting that you have special powers.
Exactly.
Hmm.
This is a conundrum.
Not to mention a confounding and perplexing problem.
I just wish there was some way I could validate Miles and let him know he's not alone.
Well, I'm off for my next flying lesson with Elliot.
Tonight he's going to show me how to properly grip his throttle.
That's what makes the big block fly.
And don't worry, we won't let anyone see us.
Although, seeing is believing, if you catch my drift.
Caught it, and am already formulating a plan.
Oh.
That's great.
You're making us a new croquet set-- just in time for summer.
I should be practicing my ledger entries.
I'm really struggling with those European sevens.
Well, Miles, you said you'd help me identify constellations for astronomy class.
Besides, you can still do your accounting on the roof.
I'll suggest that to my father.
Perhaps this year, our firm can prepare tax returns on the steeple of the Old North Church.
It's 9:10.
They should have been here by now.
Who?
Uh geese.
You know, they-they, uh, they they're very punctual with their migration.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Look!
Oh, my God, do you see that?
Absolutely-- Now, that is the Big Dipper, right?
Not the constellation, the spaceship.
Please tell me you see that.
Wow!
It is a spaceship!
Unbelievable!
It's beautiful.
A technological miracle.
Although the driver appears to be slightly inebriated.
Oh, that's probably just a problem with the big block.
That's an engine.
I know that.
I can't get it into fifth gear!
Uh, that's 'cause this only has four.
Not anymore.
Hilda, I've been trying to find the right time to tell you something but maybe I should just, uh, spit it out.
Spit all you want.
Just don't fog up the windshield.
The truth is I'm married.
Want to see me do a donut?
Yoo-hoo!
Well, you've taken this better than I thought.
But you have nothing to worry about.
I'm getting a divorce.
That just stinks.
I thought you'd be happy.
The Pluto Highway is closed.
How am I supposed to open up this puppy if I have to take surface streets?
Hilda, I am trying to talk about us.
Are you listening to anything I'm saying?
Of course I'm listening.
Way to signal, Dipwad!
Well the good news is that I'm coming out of this marriage in great shape.
I get the house and everything in it.
All she gets is this car.
Sabrina, seeing that spaceship confirms everything I've ever believed in.
And I know I'm not deluding myself because you saw it, too right?
Of course.
I can't wait to tell Professor Hutchins and this time I have a witness.
Miles, maybe we better keep this between the two of us.
You know what they say: "Double your sighting, double your scorn".
Perhaps you're right.
And all that really matters is that someone else in the world knows I'm not crazy.
As long as you don't go into accounting.
I could never do that.
My passion for the paranormal is too strong.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
So, you ready to go inside?
Not yet.
Remember the other day, when you said you were different from everybody else?
Did I say that?
I was probably just trying to make you feel better.
No, Sabrina I finally figured out how you're different.
I mean I was shocked at first but then I realized all the clues were there from the very beginning.
Miles, you've got to promise not to tell anyone.
Okay, you could really put my life in jeopardy.
Don't worry, Sabrina.
I'm not going to tell everybody that you have a crush on me.
I have a crush on you?
Oh yeah.
I have a crush on you.
Big time.
But as long as we are roommates, we must never act upon it.
I understand.
I'll do whatever I can to be a little less desirable.
It's working already.
Oy!
What a great word.
Hello.
Oh, good it's you.
I just want you to know that I'm contacting the FBI.
They're going to track you down.
You're going to be sorry you ever dialed this number.
Sabrina?
Harvey?
You're the one who's been calling here and hanging up?
Sorry about that.
Every time I heard your voice, I froze up.
Well, I'm glad you finally thawed out.
Look, ever since I saw you in Florida, you've been on my mind.
I really feel bad about the way I acted after I found out you were a A witch?
Yeah, that.
But in my defense, you did turn me into a frog and a beast and a Canadian Mountie.
Don't forget about the time I made you pregnant.
How can I?
I still have stretch marks.
No, but even considering all that you've always been a really good friend to me and the reason I'm calling is that I want to apologize.
Thanks.
That really means a lot to me.
Yeah, well, that's pretty much what I called to say and now I've pretty much said it, so Hey, is that a Cadillac flying through the sky?
I'm going to kill Aunt Hilda.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, want a fresh cup of the Guatemalan?
Obviously, you prefer the Venezuelan.
Well, why don't you go talk to him?
I can't just go up and introduce myself to a guy I don't even know.
What if he's not interested in me?
Well, you'll never know unless you go say hello.
Or hola.
You know, your choice.
I can't do it!
Just bring me something with a lot of chocolate and leave me alone.
Some people in here are so pathetic.
What can we do?
Hilda's our boss.
But once we graduate, we'll never have to see her again.
Well, you might have to-- she's your aunt.
I'm talking about our single customers.
I wish there was some way we could bring them together.
You know, "You're a nice guy; you're a nice girl.
Now, go get a blood test and a mortgage".
Hey, you know, I've heard of these parties where singles get paired up for like five minutes at a time.
If they click, they exchange phone numbers.
If they don't, they move on to the next person.
Five-minute dates?
That is so unromantic.
But what a time-saver.
Ew.
Ew.
Ew.
Are you people trying to disgust me?
Aunt Hilda, Josh and I want to turn the coffeehouse into a singles meeting place.
Great.
Then maybe I'll finally meet someone, dump this joint and never have to see these people again.
Well, I may have to see you again-- you are my niece.
No, Aunt Hilda the mixers wouldn't be for you-- they'd be for the college kids.
Oh, everything is for kids!
Movies, fashion, penne pasta.
What was so wrong with an egg noodle?
We'll charge five dollars a head; you'll get half.
Wait-wait.
We're charging for this?
Absolutely.
People are desperate for love and they're willing to pay big bucks for it.
Great idea, Josh-- Now all you need is a big, white hat and a purple El Dorado.
Don't be so cynical, Sabrina.
In a cold and alienating world it's a wonderful thing to bring people together.
I'll play hostess and do stand-up for 60% of the gross.
I'll give you 65% to take the night off.
Deal.
You know, Josh, I like the idea of helping out our single customers but I'm not sure about charging five bucks.
Are you kidding me?
These schmoes spend double that to sit alone in a cold, dark cineplex.
At least here, they have a shot at looking at someone besides Helen Hunt.
I'm sold.
And whatever money we make we'll put towards a nice dinner for the two of us.
You had me at Helen Hunt.
Poor thing, she'll never get up the courage to make a move.
A girl needs a guy who catches her eye and make her less shy when he walks by.
Hey, Sabrina.
Harvey.
I was in the neighborhood and decided to drop by.
Oh, I'm glad you did.
You know, it's great to see you.
So, you want to sit down and catch up?
Hi.
I don't usually do things like this but I'm Pam, and I think you're cute.
Thanks.
I'm Harvey, and I think you're cute, too.
Do you want to go out and grab something to eat?
I'd love to.
Uh, then afterwards, we could check out one of the new Helen Hunt movies.
See you, Sabrina.
They're lucky.
Next week that would've cost them five bucks.
Life's changing around me, and I'm gonna make it mine I'm reaching out and living by my rules Time's moving way too fast I wanna make it last 'Cause I'm out on my own now And I like the way it feels.
Hilda, I just opened our Visa bill.
How could you spend $3,000 on World War II memorabilia?
What are you talking about?
You know I'm a Boer War kind of gal.
Well, if these aren't your Visa charges and they aren't my Visa charges, then whose are they?
Mooshi-mooshi.
The name on the card is Zelda Spellman.
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto!
Just what do you think you're doing?
I know the kimono's a little gauche but it's so dang silky.
I'm talking about my credit card.
Oh, that.
Just making a little impulse buy.
The future Mrs. Mioshi Saberhagen ships in two weeks.
You bought a mail-order bride?
Dummy, what are you going to do when a Japanese woman shows up and sees that her "number one American husband" is a cat?
When she sees the engagement ring you bought her with your Discover card, she won't care!
Can you believe the nerve of that mangy little fur ball?
Stealing from us and then flaunting it.
When was the last time actual toast came out of that thing?
Oh, it's for you from the Other Realm Department of Justice.
Justice?
That can't be good.
Oh, you're looking fine.
Well, I was feeling fine until you showed up.
What do you want, Harry?
A date for New Year's.
And to read this.
"Hilda Spellman as a gesture of amnesty, the outgoing president of the Witch's Council pardons you and everyone else involved in the Witchwater scandal.
That's fantastic!
I've been pardoned!
I knew buying his wife that spa weekend would pay off.
And the bottom line is, you're no longer required to feed, clothe and house Salem Saberhagen.
The feline felon will be assigned a new halfway house.
Salem won't be living with us anymore?
Hilda, have you forgotten?
He's a hardened criminal who led a bloody insurrection to try to take over the world.
Everyone makes a mistake now and then.
I suppose if you really want to keep him Zelda!
My Fancy Feast has lumps and so does my litter box!
Hilda, roll up your sleeves and start scooping.
Book him, Dano.
Huh?
Zelda, he's gone.
We'll never see Salem again.
Free at last!
Free at last!
Thank God almighty.
We're free at last!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, what's that for?
Josh and I are throwing a singles party at the coffeehouse.
I'm sure you think it's stupid.
I haven't been on a date in five months.
I can live with stupid.
Well, there's no motivation like desperation.
Okay, so I'm watching Deep Space Nine.
It was this cool episode, uh about the Borg Well, she wasn't your type anyway.
Yeah, I usually strike out with the normal, human ones.
Let's face it, I'm never going to meet a girl.
Yes, you are-- lots of them.
Why should I pay five dollars to get rejected when I do it so well for free?
Well, for every girl that says no you're that much closer to the one that'll say yes.
Dating is a numbers game.
So getting rejected by 20 girls in one night is a good thing?
Yeah.
For only five bucks, that's a bargain.
I never realized what a pack rat Salem was.
It's amazing-- he saved everything.
Wrapping paper; aluminum foil my Cartier watch.
He needed something to go with your Ferragamo handbag.
Zellie, are you sure I did the right thing with Salem?
Yes, absolutely-- he was evil, selfish and disgusting.
You're right.
Good-bye and good riddance.
But honestly, how cute was he when he wore this little outfit?
I loved his Shirley Temple phase.
Remember how he'd put that on and sing "The Good Ship Lollipop"?
That cat could really shuffle off to Buffalo.
I do hope he lands someplace nice.
: Well, who are you?
Salem Saberhagen, AKA "The Fist" AKA "Mr. Julian".
Must be the new parolee Harry said he was sending over.
You are correct, Madame.
But now if you'll kindly show me to my quarters I'd like to freshen up before gorging on a nice ceviche appetizer.
Of course you would, yes.
He seemed nice.
Yes.
Uh-oh!
Something tells me this isn't the Good Ship Lollipop.
Welcome to Dick and Dora's prison labor camp.
My name is Snake, and I'll be your dungeon master.
Now, get sewing, or you're going to be my lunch.
: But I don't know how to sew!
Just give me a minute to thread my bobbin.
Heh-heh.
This is going great!
I mean, how cool would it be if everyone here got dates and the Singles Night really took off?
Very cool, and very profitable.
Sabrina, you and I have discovered a beautiful way to create meaningful, lasting relationships.
Switch!
I'm Steve.
I'm Erica.
I know you-- you're in my biology lab.
I've been trying to get up the nerve to talk to you all semester.
I've wanted to talk to you, too!
Let's find out if we're soul mates in the next four minutes and 20 seconds.
I think we've got a budding romance here.
Yeah, I think we do.
I mean, they do.
Well, right, yeah, them.
Why don't I, uh, make sure we have enough sugar packets?
Yeah, and I'll refill the coffee pot.
As soon as it's empty.
Time!
My name is Miles.
Thus far we've only known each other as roommates but I'm open to other avenues.
Make a U-turn-- this road is closed.
I didn't pay five bucks to get chatted up by Miles.
I want to meet that cute guy over there.
That's my friend, Brett.
He should be at your table in another four bells.
Well, the girl knows what she wants.
We may only have a few seconds together before the next bell.
I need you to sum up your entire being in four words.
Go.
Not interested in you.
Four words on the dot.
Can I get a bell, please?
Well, I'd call this evening a total success.
I bet more than a dozen phone numbers were exchanged.
Yeah.
Roxie met my friend Brett Miles met my friend Holly and I met a lot of dead presidents.
So where do you want Mr. Lincoln and his pals to take us for dinner?
Well, I know Roxie's a little bit nervous about her first date with Brett so you know maybe the four of us and the Lincolns could go someplace together.
Sounds good to me.
And old Abe's up for anything.
As long as we don't wind up at the theater.
I'm so excited about going out with Brett.
Thanks for double-dating with us.
How many times do I have to tell you?
We're not dating.
And how many times do I have to tell you that you should be?
We tried it, but it didn't work.
Then he tried it, but I just wanted to be friends.
Then I tried it, but he was dating Morgan.
Which he isn't anymore.
The man's coming over to take you to a Kung Fu movie.
Dead giveaway that he wants a serious relationship.
You think so?
What I think is that you two are perfect for each other.
I don't know what's holding either of you back.
Hey, you ready?
Maybe I am.
Where's Brett?
Oh, he couldn't make it.
Yeah, at the last second, his buddy got him a box seat for the Red Sox game.
He told me to tell you he's sorry.
That makes two of us.
Wait a minute.
Okay, Brett cancels but he doesn't bother to call Roxie and tell her himself?
Like I said, he just got the tickets he knew I was coming over here and I told him I'd give Roxie the message.
Which I did.
Roxie, are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Have a great time.
Okay, we better go.
You don't want to miss the beginning of a Bruce Lee movie.
The first ten minutes sets up the whole emotional arc.
Hold the phone.
When Brett told you he was canceling to go to the game, what did you say?
Uh, "Who's pitching"?
You didn't say anything about, you know, how rude he was how insensitive, how you could never be friends with someone who was so morally bankrupt?
I felt it was implied.
Now, come on we don't want to miss that cartoon with the little dancing hot dog.
See if you can get what I'm implying.
You and I aren't going to the movies.
All right, let me get this straight, Sabrina.
You think my friend acted like a jerk, and you're blaming me?
No, I'm blaming you 'cause you don't even realize your friend acted like a jerk.
Okay, fine, Brett was a jerk-- are you happy?
You're saying that 'cause you don't want to keep arguing.
I can't argue with that.
You know, Josh, the scary thing about this is you're not who I thought you were.
Yes I am-- I just happen to have a jerky friend.
Miles, what do you think about a guy who doesn't care how a woman is treated?
Well, what do you think about a woman who blames a guy for stuff another guy does?
You both need to relax.
This is a normal argument that eventually all couples have.
We're not a couple.
Then stop messing with my mind.
I'm going to pick up Holly for our date.
Aren't you guys supposed to be at the Bruce Lee movie?
We were until Johnny Blackheart here decided that he didn't care if his friend treated my friend like dirt.
Oh, you are just not going to let this go, are you?
Hang on a second.
You have extra tickets to the 1971 classic Han Sing Dai Hing?
There you go.
Enjoy.
On second thought, I'm coming with you.
Josh, we're not done here.
Oh, yes, we are.
Popcorn?
No, thanks.
Ugh, artificial butter flavor, yuck!
Sabrina was way out of line, wasn't she, Miles?
Hello, on a date!
Legend has it that all these guys actually die during the filming of this scene.
I mean, where does she get off blaming me for what happened to Roxy?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I acted the way any other guy would have acted.
Yeah, like a jerk!
Ow!
I think my popcorn bit me!
Shh!
This is the scene where Bruce Lee repositions the spleens of 12 lawyers from Thailand.
Now, that's a real man.
I'm glad you think so.
Gentlemen, I was going to reposition your spleens but I've learned that a real man should admit when he's behaved badly, and have the insight to urge his friends to be more sensitive.
I don't remember this in the movie, do you?
He's going to have to get back to you on that.
So.
So, here we are.
Isn't this wonderful?
Divine.
Now that Salem's not around we can eat like civilized witches.
That's true; no more guarding our plates against that vulture.
Oh, speaking of vulture, could you please pass the vulture?
Certainly.
Yes, this is such a treat.
Nobody begging for scraps leaving whiskers in your crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
Parading around in your best fishnet stockings.
God, I miss him!
Me, too.
Hilda, do you think it would be wrong of us to Way ahead of you.
You sure you don't want to give Singles Night another shot?
We booked a really hot band.
No one wants to be at that stinking coffeehouse less than me.
Except me.
Josh and I haven't spoken in a week.
I mean, he hasn't even called to apologize.
This could kill the whole relationship.
You mean the relationship you don't have with the guy you're not dating?
Yeah.
I don't want that to end.
The end of a relationship is always the most depressing part.
But it's got to be really depressing to end something that never got a chance to begin.
All I know is, he should be the first one to call and apologize.
He's the one who acted like a jerk when Brett stood you up.
Is that what this is about?
You're throwing away a great guy because of someone that never meant anything to me?
It's the principle of the thing.
If you're going to date based upon principle your choices are the Pope or St. Francis of Assisi.
So I've got options.
I like your bungalow.
I like saying "bungalow".
Bungalow.
Say it with me.
When will Salem be back?
Hard to say; he loves splashing around : in the estuary, doesn't he?
Yes.
That's funny, you know.
He never liked playing in brackish water at our house.
What's that?
Uh, the boiler; it's on the fritz again.
I think it needs to be disciplined.
Are you getting a weird feeling?
No, but there's something new I'd like to say.
Brackish water.
Say it with me: brackish water.
over, over yourself Whoa, whoa Get over yourself, good-bye, good-bye It must be hard to be you, yeah, living in your life I was always the one to cry, to cry Now, everything, everything, everything is all right Get over yourself Get over yourself, know why?
'Cause without you, see, I do anything I like Sometimes I stay out all night I do anything I want, babe And everything, everything, everything is all right Get over yourself, good-bye Everything is all right Everything is all right Get over yourself Get over yourself, good-bye.
Sabrina, this is great!
How did you get the Pop Stars to play at Singles Night?
Well, they may have a hit series but they're looking for love just like everyone else.
All right, everybody, for the next round the women will switch tables.
Let them do something for a change besides hold all us guys responsible for everything bad that happens in the world.
Oh well, maybe we wouldn't hold you responsible if you did the right thing in the first place.
How do we have a chance do the right thing if you blame us for stuff that isn't even our fault?
It is your fault; you're just too pigheaded to admit it.
What do you think Pop Stars one through five?
I think you both need some serious therapy.
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey, Josh.
Miles, what are you doing here on Singles Night?
Yeah.
Where's Holly?
It's over.
There's a surprise.
Another one of your flaky Emerson friends dumps another one of my roommates and you don't even care!
How do you know I don't care?
You didn't even give me a chance to react, and stop poking me!
Actually, I broke up with Holly.
Huh?
Uh, looks like I made a little poke mark there.
Yeah, that happens when you point your finger at the wrong person.
All right, Josh, you know, maybe I jumped all over you but I'm still upset about the Brett thing.
Uh, that's not much of an apology.
What are you talking about?
You're the one the one that needs to apologize.
Again?
Sabrina, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Until the one time you really mean it.
Boy, for a couple trying to bring people together you're setting a rotten example.
Both: We're not a couple.
Where did you get those pumps?
Other Realm Shoe Pavilion.
Do you like them?
Not particularly.
What you doing?
Translating Morse code.
I've got it.
"I'm in a basement prison cobbling shoes.
Send help and ceviche.
Hilda, this is an Other Realm prison labor camp!
Dick and Doris, shame on you!
Zap 'em, Dick!
Watch out, Zelda!
Nice work, Super Witch.
You, too, Hex Kitten.
Let's find Salem and get out of here.
All right, that's it!
I've had enough of you, Saberhagen.
I'm famished!
Everybody freeze!
Hilda!
Zelda!
Am I glad to see you!
Salem, are you all right?
Hilda, let's get out of here before Dick and Doris escape.
We'll send the authorities after these wretched men.
Come on!
Wait a minute.
All right, everybody, wrap it up.
The night's over; we're closing.
Actually, it's just beginning.
I'm sorry I only have two arms.
Pop Stars?
Well, at least someone had a good time this evening.
Yeah, Miles and the Pop Stars really seemed to hit it off.
Yeah, they make an attractive you know, whatever.
So, how is it that Miles can get along with an entire harem and you and I can't even be civil to each other?
Look, Josh, I don't want to keep going on like this.
Me, neither.
Just because I didn't like how you handled things with Brett doesn't mean we shouldn't be friends.
I mean, we still have to work together so we should figure out a way to get along so Well, that's one way.
For what it's worth if I ever had to cancel a date, I'd call you.
For what it's worth, I hope we have a date for you to not cancel.
Well, we never did go out for that dinner.
Well, maybe we can oct-up with Miles and his harem.
These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had.
And stylish.
Oh, cobbler?
Yes, ma'am!
I'd like five more pairs, one in every color.
Yeah, and how are you with matching belts?
I'll cobble whatever you want.
I'm just glad to be home.
And we're happy to have you home.
I'm sure you learned a lesson from your misbehavior?
I'm sure I have.
I am Mrs. Salem-san.
Okay come in.
I bring you gift.
Where is my husband?
Meeeeow!
Nobody perfect.
