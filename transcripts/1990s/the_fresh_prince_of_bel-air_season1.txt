{START OF EPISODE 1}
Uncle Phil!
Man!
How are you doing?
I am not your uncle Philip.
My fault, man.
I must have got the wrong crib.
I didn't know there were so many brothers living in this neighborhood.
We're doing all right, huh?
You have the right house.
I am Geoffrey, your uncle's butler.
Okay, well, I Cheerio and all that rot.
Bring the horses round, would you?
If you will follow me I will show you to your room, Master William.
Hey, man, it's cool if you just call me Will.
Master William tradition dictates that a clean, unbreakable line be drawn between a family and their butler.
Therefore, it is necessary for the operation of a household that you address me as Geoffrey and I, in turn, address you by your proper title: Master William.
Who are you, Robo-butler, man?
Come with me, Master William.
Yo, G. Let me rap to you for a second.
All this Master William stuff, I'm not down with that, man.
Make it sound like we're back on the plantation, like: "Massa William!
Massa William"!
Let's come up with something better that you could call me.
What would you prefer?
Check this: "His Royal Freshness".
That's dope.
Master William, walk this way.
No.
- Willie!
- Hey, Aunt Viv!
- Sweetie, hi.
- How you doing?
My goodness, let me look at you.
Turn around.
The last time we saw you, you were this funny little boy.
Now look at you.
My goodness, you are a man.
That was the plan.
It is amazing.
You certainly have grown, Will.
Well, we all have.
Did you enjoy the trip?
The plane ride was stupid.
All the way first-class Excuse me?
- I'm saying the plane was dope - Excuse me?
No.
Stupid, dope No, that doesn't mean what you How would he say The flight was really neat.
Geoffrey, would you take Will to his room, and help him get settled in?
- Yes, Madam.
- Nice seeing you.
- Master William.
- You got to love this guy, right?
- Did you see the way he was dressed?
- What's wrong with it?
- You hear that language?
- We used slang when we were kids.
Do you remember our first date?
You took one look at me and said: "That is a bad dress".
You could've just said it was a good dress.
I could have, if I liked it.
Actually, it was a bad dress.
That's stupid.
Now, take it for whatever meaning you want.
Now he's got you doing it.
Philip, cut him some slack, please.
He's my nephew.
And I would just appreciate it if you would try to understand him.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetie pie.
- Hi, Ashley.
Yo, this place is huge, man.
Next time I go to my room, I'm gonna take some bread crumbs.
- Will, this is Ashley.
- Hi.
My little Scottish cousin.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm your humble servant.
- He's cute.
- I know he is.
- I'm gonna take a swim before dinner.
- Good luck.
The pool heater's broken.
- Don't you just hate it when that happens?
- Yes, that is my pet peeve.
- You got your own pool here?
- And a tennis court, too.
Yo, this is better than Love Boat.
This boy gonna be maxing and relaxing.
Hold on just a minute, son.
We promised your mother that you're here to work hard, straighten out and learn some good old-fashioned American values.
Dad, I need $300.
Hilary, your cousin Will is here.
Hi.
Dad, I need $300.
That's a lot of money, Hilary.
What for?
I need a new hat.
- For what?
- Probably her head.
Okay, I'm going on the Save the Ozone celebrity bus next Saturday.
It's gonna be Bruce Willis and Demi, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen, I can't remember which.
We're taking the bus all over town to protest air pollution and then we're gonna motor to the beach and have a big bonfire.
What?
I'm not an expert or anything, but don't you think driving a big old bus around town and then having a bonfire is sort of adding to the problem of pollution?
Look, if this weren't a good idea I really don't think Ally Sheedy would be involved.
Hey, look who's here.
Benson.
- This is for you.
- But I didn't get you anything.
Your uncle has invited several of the partners from his law firm to dinner.
At the time of the invitation, he did not realize you'd be descending upon him today.
And regrettably, it was too late to cancel.
Yo, are we having a party?
We're gonna get stupid, right?
For some of us, that will require very little effort indeed.
- Miss Ashley.
- That will be all, Geoffrey.
That's all you had to say to get rid of him?
I've been racking my brain.
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Ashley.
This is nice.
You're very talented.
Well, I'm glad I'm good at something.
I tried out for the school chorus today, but I didn't get in.
How come?
Well, when I auditioned for Mrs. Berkley I couldn't remember all the words to the song.
The part I remembered was fantastic.
- I'm sure it was.
I bet you're def.
- That's what she said.
Not deaf.
D-E-F.
That's just slang.
Means terrific, good.
Thank you.
You should try rapping.
When you're rapping, you mess up the words and make up some new ones right there on the spot.
Let's try this.
I'll sing one line, you make up a line to rhyme it.
- Okay.
- All right.
Let's see.
"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" - I'm thinking, all right?
- That's all right.
We got all day.
- Okay, I've got it.
- Here we go.
"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" "I'd like to hit her in the head with Roget's Thesaurus" "Don't need no choir when you're a rapper" "Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down and zap her" "Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing" "Get a load of me and my rapping cousin" Ashley, why don't you go downstairs and get ready for dinner.
- Okay, Daddy.
Bye, Will.
- Check you later, Ash.
Look who's here, Will.
Who is he?
It's your cousin, Carlton.
Don't you remember?
When you two were little, people thought you were twins.
You looked exactly alike.
I guess some things never change.
- How's it going there, Will?
- It's going all right.
- Malcolm X. - He's sort of my hero.
Well, he was a great man.
I don't know if I'd call him my hero exactly.
- Really?
Who are your heroes?
- Well, my dad.
And Bryant Gumbel.
He's darn good.
Oh, my, yes!
I see they brought your tuxedo.
Tell me something, Will.
Have you ever attended a formal dinner before?
Other than that thing at Buckingham Palace, no.
The important thing to remember is to relax, enjoy yourself and when in doubt, do whatever Carlton's doing.
- You got it, man.
- Okay, I'll see you at dinner.
- That's a really neat tux, isn't it, Will?
- Yes.
It's definitely the cat's meow.
Wait till we come downstairs in those tuxes.
People may not think we're twins, but I bet they'll think we're brothers.
I don't think you have to worry about anybody mistaking you for a brother.
Touché.
This is going to be great.
Your first formal dinner.
And tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the gang.
Maybe we'll play a set of tennis or two.
Yes, this is going to be wild.
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs changing.
Not Will.
President Reagan.
- You didn't?
- What do you mean, I didn't?
- You invited him again.
- Why not?
He's our neighbor.
He's turned down the last 16 invitations.
When are you gonna take a hint?
- Maybe I should call his house.
- Don't.
I don't want him here.
- Why not?
- Because he'll bring her.
Anyway, Bruce, Demi and I all feel that the ozone layer must be protected.
I mean, every square foot of rain forest that's cut down brings us just one step closer to global warming.
We have to learn to protect the earth.
Not just for ourselves and not just for our children but for the future of all mankind.
I had no idea it was such a serious problem.
I really commend you for getting involved in such a good cause.
Thanks.
It's my passion.
- Where can I send a donation?
- I don't know.
Oh, my God!
Philip, don't make a big thing out of it.
If this is how he feels comfortable He's not killing anybody.
Aren't you going to introduce Will?
Introduce him.
Well, Steve, David, Henry.
This is Will, my nephew by marriage.
Will, these are my partners in the law firm of Furth, Winn and Meyer.
Earth, Wind & Fire!
When's your next album coming out?
Will is going to go to Bel-Air Academy with Carlton.
Good for you, Will.
I used to fence at Bel-Air.
Really?
How much do you think we could get for that stereo?
These hors d'oeuvres look tempting.
Don't mind if I do.
- How could you do that?
- It's all in the tongue.
I'll show you later.
There are other people at this table.
You're right.
Any requests?
- Sweetie, would you say grace, please?
- Yes, Mommy.
"Hey, there, Lord My name is Ashley Banks "My family and friends Want to give you some thanks "So before this dinner's All swallowed and chewed "Thank you, God, for this stupid food" Hey, Geoffrey, home butler.
I'm glad to see you, man.
It is a special thrill for me as well.
Check this out.
I'm gonna be down here for a while.
Why don't you hop on in the kitchen and get me some cocoa?
Master William while it is my natural inclination to accede to your every demand I officially go off duty at 9:00 p.m. And if you care to look at your watch, you will note that the long hand is on 12, and the short hand is on 9.
It is 9:00, Master William.
And do you know what that means?
Masterpiece Theatre is on.
Sir, do you require anything further of me?
No, Geoffrey.
Then I shall retire.
Man, he took that hard.
I want to talk to you.
- About what?
- You know.
From the minute you came, you've been a one-man wrecking crew trying to tear down what's taken a lot of hard work to build up skewering everything with your flippant shenanigans!
Man, I was with you up till "skewering".
You know what I'm talking about.
You deliberately tried to embarrass me tonight and I don't get it.
Your aunt and I went through a lot of trouble to bring you here.
- This is the thanks we get?
- I ain't asked to come.
Everyone's talking about shipping me off, and dressing me up and changing me into something I don't wanna be.
Nobody wants to change you.
You told me yourself I got to straighten out.
"When in doubt, act as Carlton acts".
Man, I don't wanna be like Carlton.
I'm a joker.
I play around.
I have fun.
Being a joker is what's gotten you into trouble.
You may think it's cool to be on the streets when you're 17 but when you're my age, it's a waste.
I can't think that far ahead.
That's your problem.
You can't take anything seriously.
Look, man, I don't have the problem.
You have the problem.
I remind you of where you came from and what you used to be.
I don't know, somewhere between Princeton or the office, you got soft.
You forgot who you are and where you came from.
You think you're so wise.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Let me tell you something, son.
I grew up on the streets just like you.
I encountered bigotry you could not imagine.
Now, you have a nice poster of Malcolm X on your wall.
I heard the brother speak.
I read every word he wrote.
Believe me, I know where I come from.
- You actually heard Malcolm speak, man?
- That's right.
So before you criticize somebody, you find out what he's all about.
I'll take care of you in the morning.
I'm going to bed.
Hold on.
I can't tell my side of the story?
No, you can't.
I know what you're all about.
Believe me, the very thought of it makes me very tired.
Good night.
Ladies and gentlemen, my fly girl, Ashley Banks.
- Would you teach me how to dance?
- Yeah.
Not in here.
Even I lose my rhythm in this room.
Okay.
- Could you do me a favor?
- Sure.
I seem to be missing a Walkman.
So if it shows up anywhere, like, I don't know, on your head, maybe maybe you could get that to me.
- Sorry.
Dad won't let me get one.
- How come?
He says he wants to hear everything I'm listening to, to make sure it's not bad.
- What record does he think is good?
- He really likes the Care Bears.
Ash, from time to time, your father's gonna say or do things that may seem irrational or hard for you to understand.
It's not because he's mean, or a bad guy, or that he doesn't care about you.
It's that he's from Mars, Ashley.
- I gotta get washed up.
- Me, too.
- I'm really glad you're living here.
- Thanks, Ash.
You're like the big brother I never had.
What are you talking about?
You got You're right.
I see your point.
How many bathrooms you got in this place?
Four and a half.
A half bath?
How does that work?
It doesn't have everything a full bathroom has.
You better show me a full bathroom.
I don't want to take no chances.
Next bathroom.
Can't a person gargle in peace?
Hilary, are you gonna be in there for long or is this just like a pit stop?
Stop hounding me.
I'm trying to take off my makeup.
Now, go away.
Okay, good night, Hilary.
I knew it!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Today, sir, I thought we might begin the day with an aspirin preventative medicine being so much the mode.
It's too late, Geoffrey.
I already have a headache just anticipating that infernal hammering at the office.
I thought the workmen were supposed be done by yesterday.
Shockingly enough, Vivian, they're behind schedule.
Dad, it's so obvious.
If all that hammering is bothering you, just tell them to quit it.
I don't even want to talk about it.
These are the only moments of peace and quiet I'll have all day.
Another aspirin, sir?
Perhaps a gun.
What the devil is he doing up there?
I Got The Power by Snap.
Snap is a great band.
When Crackle and Pop cut a disc, then call me.
- What's so funny?
- Carlton told a joke.
No, Hilary.
Carlton is a joke.
Mommy, who's gonna take me to my tennis lesson after school today?
Are you sure it's tennis today?
Maybe you'd better check your schedule.
Schedule?
My parents bought me this calendar so I could keep my lessons straight.
Didn't you have a schedule for after school at my age?
Yeah, the TV Guide.
See, Monday is for ballet, Tuesday is riding, Wednesday is violin.
I thought today was violin, sweetie pie.
You mean Ashley would have shown up for her violin lesson in her tennis outfit?
I just pictured it.
I'm two for two.
I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.
May I suggest retirement?
Keep them coming, Will.
So, Mommy, who's going to drive me?
There's a growing pollution problem in this city, and I will not contribute to it.
I absolutely refuse to drive anybody anywhere until a responsible car pool is organized.
But, Hilary, Ashley is in a car pool.
I just don't want to do it, okay?
I have an idea.
Will, you don't have any chores this afternoon.
You can drive Ashley.
Word up.
Kick over the keys to the Jag.
- The Benzito?
- The station wagon.
Come on, you're gonna ruin my rep.
You're only 17.
You don't have a rep yet.
You'll drive her to her class, wait for her there, and bring her home.
Come on, I got to sit through a hour of them scratchy violins?
You might learn something.
The same thing I learned from banging my head against a pole: Don't do it again.
This is your new job.
Wednesdays you are Ashley's driver.
Understood?
Yes'm.
I'll be more than happy to drive you to the Piggly Wiggly, Miss Daisy.
I'm sorry.
Ladies, hold it.
Wait a minute.
Let's try something different.
Everybody just repeat after me, okay?
Come, girls!
You are late.
Now let's begin with the piece you were to memorize from Stravinsky's Violin Concerto in D minor.
And remember, you are playing this for a woman who was the great Stravinsky's lover.
One, two, three, four.
Faster!
Stop!
You, there.
What you do here?
I'm Ashley's cousin.
I was just waiting to drive her home.
You make me kind of nervous with that stick, lady.
You dare to read while great Stravinsky is played?
I wasn't as tight with the man as you were.
Do not attempt to make joke with me.
I was lover of both Laurel and Hardy.
Guess that look really works for you then.
Hey, Ash, that was decent to listen to that kind of music without having to see Freddy Krueger kill somebody.
- I'm glad somebody enjoys it.
- What, don't you?
Not yet, but when I'm older, it will be very useful to me.
No, wait.
That's tennis.
- Who told you that?
- My dad.
Just because your dad likes something, doesn't mean you have to like it.
He likes being a lawyer.
You don't have to be a lawyer.
I am going to be a lawyer.
Ash, the world does not need another Philip Banks.
We might not have enough farmland to support the one we have.
No, the world needs an Ashley Banks.
Girls, you must remember to practice more, no?
Violin is very jealous, much like the sexy Toscanini.
If you even look at another, it will not speak to you for days.
But if you give all of yourselves, it will fulfill your every need and set your very soul on fire.
What does she mean by that?
Let's just say that lady expects a lot from a piece of wood and some strings.
- Your aspirin, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
Do you attribute your headaches, sir solely to the ongoing construction in your office or do you suppose there might be a stress factor involved?
This is how my day went, Geoffrey.
At 9:00, they were pounding.
At 10:00, they were jackhammering.
By noon, a pneumatic drill came into play.
And, Geoffrey, they were just repainting the office.
I'd say that's cause for stress.
Wouldn't you?
You know, sir, the Earl of Cranbrook to whom I was in service for several years suffered from the most severe headaches.
And you're saying these were caused by some sort of stress?
I should very much doubt it.
He spent his days riding to the hounds, and his evenings attending rather pleasant dinner parties with his delightful wife, Lady Celia.
Now, she was a terribly good snooker player, one of the best.
- One night, she bet - Geoffrey.
Where does the stress come in?
It certainly doesn't in Lord Cranbrook's case.
I never saw a calmer household.
Then what was the point of the story?
Sheer entertainment, sir.
What the devil was that?
I believe the technical term is a "rim shot".
Who did it?
Utter speculation, of course, but my guess is Master William.
Ashley, honey where is your violin?
- Big Sal has it.
- Big Sal?
He owns this great store where you don't need any money.
You just go in and give him something you don't even want anymore - and he gives you this ticket.
Then - A pawnshop?
- You took her to a pawnshop?
- Yeah, it was really hard, too.
You don't have many pawnshops in Bel-Air.
That's really a shame.
- I had to go all the way to East LA.
- East LA?
- They gave me a great deal.
- They gave you a set of drums.
And I made them throw in a little gift for each of you.
Close your eyes.
- Vivian!
- I want my present.
Okay, open.
What a lovely antique necklace.
- What is this?
- Daddy, it's a diamond.
No, it isn't.
- You don't like it?
- No, I do not.
Can I have it?
How dare you pawn her violin!
- She don't even like playing it no more.
- She will learn to like it later.
A young woman who can play a violin is an accomplished young lady.
A girlie that can play the drums can write her own ticket.
Will, I want the best for Ashley.
When I was a kid, I loved classical music, but my parents couldn't afford lessons.
I used to stand out in the parking lot of the Philharmonic hoping to catch a spare note on the night air.
Philip, when I met you, you were into James Brown.
- He liked James Brown?
- He even wore his hair like him.
He had hair?
You know, it is possible to like both classical music and James Brown.
I could not agree more.
So let's let Ashley play whatever she wants.
She spent an entire year on the violin.
So if she wants to try something new, let her.
You tell him, Aunt Viv.
- And as for you, young man - Love you.
The next time you decide to visit a pawnshop, don't.
- Are we clear on that?
- Yes.
Master William, there is a young gentleman downstairs with a rather large radio who is here to see you.
- He claims his name is Jazz.
- Yo, word up.
Send him up.
- Now, who is this Jazz fellow?
- I heard the boy at a club.
He was all of that.
He will be Ashley's new music teacher.
I mean, he's not as experienced as Madame Chatchka, but then who is?
Mr. Jazz.
It's nice to meet you, Jazz.
How do you do?
I'm Mr. Banks.
You got that right.
Man, you're loaded!
Yo, what's up, J.?
Come on, let's just leave them alone.
- I asked him to take her to her lesson - I know, baby.
Tell Mama all about it.
Ash, how about let Jazz get busy one time?
So, Carlton, how's the soccer scene?
Well, I may be moving up from JV to Varsity, but Am I the only one who finds this drumming inappropriate for high tea?
I can't take another week of this.
From morning until night all I hear is this relentless, pulsating, thumping beat.
- I'm going to the Hard Rock Cafe.
- Hilary.
Stay.
We are having tea.
It's a civilized way for me to have a conversation with my family so someone talk.
I want her severely punished!
It was the only time that Jazz could give her a lesson today.
- I wish you would stop calling him that.
- But that's his name.
It is not.
It can't be.
These kids like to make up their own names.
Let them.
Okay, fine.
From now on, I'm no longer Philip Banks.
Just call me King Edward IV.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
Humor, sir.
Dad, I'm as liberal as the next guy but it's time for someone to take the reins.
High tea has been a weekly tradition in our family for as long as I can remember.
If we let young Will ruin this for us, what's next to go?
Christmas?
I can't answer that question for you, son.
Ask your mother.
Come on, you two.
High tea is not a sacred institution.
It's not the tea.
It's not the drums.
It's Ashley.
I've spent nine years trying to raise a proper young lady and Will is undoing all of my work in a week.
- Ashley, honey, come down here!
- What are you doing?
He's punishing her.
No, Hilary, I just want her to spend some time with her family.
Same thing.
What is all this yelling about downstairs?
Look, we are trying to give a music lesson upstairs.
Work with me, people, please?
You've been practicing all afternoon.
Look, that is the only way she's gonna become a star.
This young lady has the drive, the good look, and the intelligence to get to the top but she will not be on Yo!
MTVRaps if you all don't work with me.
Practice is over, Will.
Ashley, honey, it's teatime.
Tea.
Biscuits!
Geoffrey, put on our teatime music, please.
You'll love this, honey.
It's Brandenburg Concertos.
Jazz, hit me with some sugar, man.
- How about a little milk?
- No, I'll get it.
I thought this was sterling.
It's got that certain weight to it.
Yes.
This is my favorite part.
Ashley, honey, this is possibly the most beautiful music ever written.
- Would someone turn it up for me, please?
- Jazz, crank it up for me.
Yes.
Listen, darling.
Listen to the violins.
Beautiful.
The oboes will be coming next.
Geoffrey, would you tell Miss Ashley I'd like to speak to her?
Right away, sir.
Now, I know you're upset, but I want you to stay calm.
I'm calm.
I'm happy.
I'm in control.
You see, Vivian, I had lost control.
"Lost control"?
You drop-kicked a human being across our front lawn.
It felt good, damn it.
I'm back in the saddle again.
You know, I think living down the street from the Reagans has had a very bad effect on you.
Will, your uncle just wanted to speak with Ashley.
No, let him stay.
I want him to hear this, too.
I hope this isn't going to be one of those Theo moments.
Ashley, honey, sit down.
Ashley, baby through no fault of your own things went down a very wrong path this week.
But luckily, your daddy has put it all back together.
You're going to return to the violin.
I've called Madame Chatchka.
She's agreed to give you a makeup lesson.
You must have caught her on one of her rare free nights.
Will, please?
We've all lost sight of the most important thing here and that is what is best for Ashley.
It's not what's best for Ashley.
You're trying to control her.
She's 9 years old, and she's got a calendar telling her where she's got to be, what she's gotta do.
She doesn't have to worry about that anymore because now you tell her what to do, right?
There's only one thing wrong with that: You're not her father.
How come you didn't know she doesn't like the violin?
She liked it for a year before you moved in.
Can you explain that?
- I never liked it, Daddy.
- That explains it.
Look, if you ask her, she'll tell you she wants to play the drums.
I don't like the drums, either.
See?
Now you confused her.
I'm not confused.
I just didn't want to disappoint you, Will.
And I didn't want to disappoint you, Daddy.
Now hold on.
Let's get this straight.
Ashley, you don't have to please Will, and you don't have to please your father.
You just continue with the lessons that you like best.
- Do you mean it, Mommy?
- Absolutely, sweetheart.
- Then I want to quit ballet.
- Ballet?
Honey, no.
But you look so cute in that little tutu.
- I really hate it, Mommy.
- But, honey, just until Christmas?
Do you believe that?
- She wants to quit everything.
- I know.
These kids today have no attention span.
I blame television.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
What dog did he steal that sweater from?
Probably his wife.
Good God, who shot the couch?
Give her a break, Hilary.
She just won the Kentucky Derby.
Who's that lady with Nell Carter?
That's not Nell Carter.
That's my father!
God, you're so shallow.
I hate you.
You're stupid and ugly and I wish you would die.
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Look at her!
Brake!
Hit the brake, Will!
- What in the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
It ain't my fault.
I panicked.
That squirrel came out of nowhere.
Philip, I'll call the manager and have him remove the cart.
Oh, let's just draw more attention to ourselves.
- Get in the cart, Vivian.
- No.
I'm sorry, Mr. Banks, but no golf carts in the dining room.
You've certainly made a name at this country club.
I wouldn't be surprised if they revoked our shuffleboard privileges.
That's fine with me.
This place is wack.
I'm out of here.
Hold up.
Special bulletin.
Hormones to Will.
Hold up yourself, Will.
That's Mimi Mumford.
You can't get to first base with her unless you impress her father.
He's an eminent surgeon, a championship polo player and around these parts, he's known as Dr. No.
- Why do they call him that?
- Because he never says "yes".
No young man is good enough for his daughter.
He ain't gonna have a chance to tell me no 'cause I ain't gonna ask.
Mimi, if you're not busy on Friday night would you like to accompany me to the Apple Blossom ball?
No.
What's your name, boy?
What school do you go to?
What college are you applying to?
What's your career plans?
I'm just a sophomore, sir.
I don't really know yet.
Out of here, son.
You disgust me.
So, what kind of guy does Dr. No say yes to?
Fellas with good grades, good manners, good looks.
In a word, me.
So why haven't you made your move on Miss Mimi?
Not my type.
Doesn't tickle my fancy.
Well, she can tickle mine.
If only wishing made it so.
Let's face it, Will.
You lack the social graces to impress someone like Dr. No.
Boy, you must be on dog food.
I am the most handsome, the most intelligent and unequivocally the most flamboyant bachelor since Billy Dee.
This isn't West Philly, Will.
It's Bel-Air.
And the women here are different.
I guarantee you Dr. No will say no.
- Yeah?
I bet he won't.
- I bet he will.
- I bet he won't.
- I'll bet he will.
Who says the art of conversation is dead?
All right, Will.
You think you can be a gentleman?
How do you propose on going about it?
Carlton, it's very easy to be a geek.
All I have to do is follow you around for a day.
It isn't as easy as it looks.
And with your father's permission I'd love to escort you to the Apple Blossom ball.
I had no idea you two were getting along so well.
What's going on here, Carlton?
Will's got a thing for Mimi Mumford so I'm teaching him how to be a perfect gentleman.
I want a piece of this.
Observe, Will, this is how a perfect gentleman talks to a young lady.
"Say there, Mimi "might I say that you rate a perfect 10 on my niftiness meter"?
I don't think so.
Uncle Phil, how did you used to crack on the girlies?
What I'm about to tell you is going to change your life forever.
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
First, I take her hand then I stroke it gently but imperceptibly Iook deep into her eyes, blow gently in her ear let my mouth curl up into a smile make a low, rumbling, hypnotic sound.
Philip, that's what you did on our first date.
- That's right.
- You're lucky you got a second one.
Allow me, sir.
Certainly, Geoffrey, if you think you can do any better.
Mademoiselle.
My life was but a mere whisper until you entered into it.
Whether it was chance or blind fate or kismet, if you will, that brought us together I would be remiss to let this moment pass without telling you how deeply you have affected the very core of my being.
Baby!
- The fish knife.
- Yeah, right.
No, it is right.
He got it right.
- He got it right!
- He did?
Get your own geisha.
Excuse me, Master Carlton.
- You were saying?
- Will, he picked out the fish knife.
Will, I want you to pay very close attention.
Which one is the shrimp fork?
By george, I think he's got it.
I think he's got it.
Where did he get that jacket?
Probably off the rack.
- Did you hear about his Jaguar?
- The one he bought secondhand?
Okay, just remember you're from Connecticut you're transferred to Bel-Air Academy, and you row on the crew team.
Now, where did you transfer from?
Bend over.
It's Andover.
We're going back home.
I was joking, man.
Relax.
Hook it up.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Mumford.
I have a friend who's new in town.
He's the new star on the crew team.
Would you like to meet him?
No.
I respect your wishes, sir but I'd just like to say kudos on that polo match.
Super form.
You saw it, huh?
Excuse me.
I didn't get your name.
Smithers, sir.
Kip Smithers.
Have a seat, Smithers.
- May I join you, sir?
- No.
What school do you go to?
What college have you applied to?
What's your career plans?
Bel-Air Academy, Princeton, and thoracic surgery, sir.
Thoracic surgery.
That's my field.
What aspect of it interests you the most?
The cutting part.
That's the part I like, too.
Listen, I'm glad you're a fan of polo.
I have a very fine string of Arabians.
Really?
With turbans and everything?
Very funny, Smithers.
You had me there for a moment.
I thought you were a blithering idiot.
There's my daughter.
Would you like to meet her?
Gosh, sir.
There's a big question mark on that one.
I seem to be painfully shy with the fairer sex.
Nonsense.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Poodles.
There is someone I'd like you to meet.
Mimi, Kip Smithers.
Varsity crew from Bel-Air.
A gentleman and a scholar and soon to be a fine surgeon.
You flatter me, sir.
I'll just leave the two of you alone.
- Mimi - Look, before you get yourself all worked up into a lather, I just would like to say this.
I am sick of you white-washed, preppy stuffed shirts.
What?
I don't need some stooge who's going to play up to my father.
I want a real man.
Someone dangerous.
Someone exciting.
Someone from the streets.
- What's so funny?
- Yo, baby.
Your prince is in effect, baby.
I'm not down with this preppy nonsense.
Carlton told me to do this.
I'm definitely straight out the 'hood.
That was the worst homeboy act I've ever heard.
It's not an act.
It's the real deal.
Yo, C!
Come here!
Mimi.
Kip.
Carlton, would you please tell her who I really am?
- Who you really are?
- Yes.
He's Kip Smithers, from Connecticut.
He transferred from Andover to Bel-Air, so he could row with the crew.
No.
Tell her where I'm really from.
England?
For future reference, Will, our club frowns on strangulation.
This is all your fault.
You got me into this mess.
- Me.
- Yeah!
This preppy nonsense.
I knew women didn't like that mess.
If I would've had my way, I would've had my way.
Congratulate me.
It took all day but I finally found the perfect pair of alligator pumps to wear to the Save the Everglades rally tonight.
- Will has a crush on Mimi Mumford.
- That fat girl?
Mimi is not fat.
Not today.
Liposuction.
She's been vacuumed more times than a hooked rug.
She looks good now, right?
I don't see your point.
Just wave a chili-cheese dog in front of her nose and see how much of your arm you come back with.
Will.
So, how did it go with Mimi Mumford?
He struck out.
Okay, Will, you've taken advice from Carlton, from Philip, and Geoffrey but you have not gone to the most logical source: the woman of the house.
Before I was married, I had my share of admirers.
A sorrier bunch of deadbeats you'll never meet.
The ones that I was most attracted to were the ones who were secure enough to just be themselves.
And that's my advice to you.
Just be yourself.
Thanks, Aunt Viv.
So, Will, are you going to take Mom's advice?
Man, you got to be crazy.
Mimi wants a street-wise, Harley, bad-to-the-bones type guy, man.
If I could show her that I'm dangerous, I'll have her like that.
I'll bet you wouldn't.
- I bet I would.
- I'll bet you wouldn't.
- I bet you wouldn't.
- I bet you would.
See, I fooled you.
Remember, I'm wanted in five states I'm hiding out from the police for robbing a gun store - and what did I do before then?
- You went to Penn State.
I went to the state pen.
Sorry.
I thought Penn State was bad enough.
Mimi, top of the evening.
Carlton, for the 900th time, no, I will not go out with you.
- I thought you said she wasn't your type.
- She isn't.
She's too negative.
I'm not here for that.
Although if you just gave it some objective thought Anyway, I'm here for him.
Does he need to go to the bathroom?
No, he's just being his bad self.
What you saw before was just a charade.
Kip is his street name.
K-l-P.
It stands for conceived in prison.
He's my cousin and he's from the Bedford-Stuyvesant region of Brooklyn wherein he is a felon.
Okay.
Then what's he doing here in Bel-Air?
He's living with us to escape, and I quote, "the man".
Voila.
I thought you said he rode crew.
No, baby.
You misunderstood.
He said I wrote for the 2 Live Crew.
But, see, they kicked me out because my lyrics was too abrasive.
He's as nasty as he wants to be.
I kid you not.
Baby.
You look so good I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of y'all.
Yo, baby, Fresh Prince in full effect.
It's time to get busy.
You can't hay, can you, baby?
You work on that, all right, baby?
Salutations, Doctor.
This is quite an intense shindig, huh?
Listen, I just want to find out how things are going with Mimi.
I'm having a little trouble breaking the proverbial ice, sir.
I hope I don't embarrass myself, being in your illustrious presence and all.
Don't worry.
I'll just make myself scarce but, I do have one piece of advice.
- Be yourself.
- That's a natch, sir.
This music is def, exceptionally def.
Carlton, beat it!
I'm dope.
Yo.
What were you talking to my father about?
I told him if he don't stay out my face, we would take it to the street.
Baby, you close your eyes when you dance with me.
Salutations yet again, Doctor.
Just a thought.
Mimi loves horses and you love polo I thought that might break the ice.
Thanks for the prescription, Doc.
Enough said.
What were you talking to my father about this time?
I wasn't listening to him, baby.
I was stealing his wallet.
Kip, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you before.
I should have seen right through that thin charade.
Let's go someplace and get busy.
Yes, ma'am.
- But first, I want you to rap for me.
- What?
You know, let me hear some of them abrasive lyrics.
Okay, baby.
This one I got banned in Buffalo for.
And that is just the type of music we will not let our children listen to.
Smithers, what is the meaning of that ridiculous hat?
Who put this on my head?
Daddy, isn't he funny?
No.
He disgusts me.
Get out of my sight.
Wait a minute.
You can't talk to him like that, Daddy.
He's practically a convicted killer, and I love him.
A convicted killer?
Who are you?
All right, look.
I'm not a young republican from Connecticut and I'm not a hood from Bed-Stuy.
I'm Will Smith from West Philly and I've been busting my butt all night trying to impress you and trying to scare you.
And I'm exhausted.
I'm going home, and I'm going to sleep 'cause, baby, ain't no girl that fly for me to go through all this trouble for.
Yo, baby.
What's up?
Miss Hilary.
Did you have a good time at the Save the Everglades fund raiser?
Geoffrey, these events are not about having a good time.
They're consciousness-raising experiences.
When you hear about all of the species that are on the brink of extinction it's grim, grave, and very sobering.
- Tom Cruise was near tears.
- Wasn't he gorgeous?
So there I was, G, then this real fly honey walked by, right?
So I decided I'll just be myself.
I said, "Yo, baby".
And she loved me!
- Then what happened?
- Well, then her husband came in.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Shall I continue to delay dinner, madam?
Yes, Geoffrey.
I don't know where he is.
He's never late without calling.
- Do you think Daddy's all right?
- It's awfully late, Mom.
Okay, let's not jump to any conclusions.
We're all worried, but let's Bill Cosby has a streetwise niece coming on his show.
That should be decent.
- I'm home.
- Daddy.
- Philip, where have you been?
- I was at the office.
I'm sorry I didn't call, but I wanted to rush home with the great news.
What is the highest recognition a self-made Black professional can receive?
A raise!
No, darling, it's not a raise.
I'm getting the Urban Spirit Award.
- Philip, we're so proud of you.
- Is it a cash award?
Hilary, don't be so shortsighted.
This award is an honor which leads to prestige which leads to cash.
The community leaders are recognizing me for helping our brothers and sisters on the streets.
The only time you're on the streets is when you're waiting for the valet to bring your car around.
Is that so, son?
Let me tell you something.
The '63 March on Washington?
I was there.
The '65 demonstrations at Selma, I was there.
The '65 Watts Riots, I was there, too.
Seems to me every place you go, trouble follows.
Your uncle deserves this award.
He's fought a lot of discrimination cases.
He's prosecuted slumlords.
He's started scholarship funds.
All that and he still found time to vote for Reagan.
Twice.
Thank you, sweetheart.
It wouldn't be bad if you could remember some of that when the reporter gets here.
- Reporter?
- Photographer?
New dress.
All right, you can have a new dress.
I want you all to look your best for the newspaper interview and the awards banquet.
Daddy, this is wonderful.
Two new dresses.
Have you called your parents?
You bet.
They're taking the next plane out.
Great.
Grandma and Grandpa are coming to visit.
Toys.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
Come on, Ash.
Rock this funky joint, baby.
Come on, Ash.
Less like George Michael, more like Hammer.
Come on.
That's it.
Baby, you got to put some more butt into it.
That's it.
Yeah.
Excuse me, but Grandma and Grandpa are here.
I just saw the cab pull up the driveway.
- Grandpa.
- Sweet potato.
- Grandma.
- Ashley, sweetie.
My, how you've grown.
Hilary, sweetie.
My, how you've grown.
Carlton, sweetie.
Hi.
Grandma, Grandpa, this is my cousin Will.
Hi, Will.
Your uncle told us all about you.
I don't know, Hattie.
He don't look like the devil incarnate.
Thanks.
So, how was the flight from Baltimore?
- Baltimore?
- That's where Uncle Phil's from, right?
He moved there when he was 16, but he was born and raised in Yamacraw.
- Yamacraw?
- North Carolina.
I can't believe Zeke never mentioned his hometown.
Zeke?
Mama.
Pop.
Hey, Uncle Zeke.
- Give your old man a hug.
- Okay, Pop.
Am I tripping, or does this remind you of the last episode of Family Ties?
Daddy, didn't I send you money for a new suit?
You're looking at it.
When you sent that money me and my buddy Leroy went down to the dry goods store and we each got a suit, a fishing rod, and some radial tires.
Well, I guess I better get to fixing supper.
Geoffrey.
This is what I'll be needing.
"One pound of lard "four handfuls poke greens "and a big old slab of fatback".
Now, if it comes to more than $1, they're cheating you.
We are going to have pork chops, collard greens baked macaroni, and sweet potato pie.
Have mercy!
Grandma, Grandpa, you want to go see our swimming pool?
That's a good idea.
Growing up, my Zeke always did love our swimming hole.
He would strip down to his birthday suit and dive right in.
Granny, please.
It's almost dinnertime.
He just loved his skinny-dipping, him and Melvin.
Melvin.
I don't think we want to hear anything Au contraire, Dad.
The Melvin stories are priceless.
- So, Melvin was like his best friend?
- Melvin was his pig.
I have plenty stories about my Zeke.
- Are any of them humiliating stories?
- The best ones are.
Let's start with those.
It's 3:00 in the morning, Will.
- How did you see me?
- Mama knows.
Look, Granny, please don't tell Uncle Phil.
I'm just a little bit past my curfew.
How much is a little?
Let's just say I went out after I was supposed to be in.
- Don't do it again.
- All right.
What are you doing up so late?
Child, I had to get up and get breakfast started.
I don't know what you all got that Geoffrey for.
- Five-card draw?
- Yeah, I'm with it.
Granny, I really like you.
You and Grandpa, you have fun.
You tell jokes.
- You all bust me up.
- Thank you, son.
Hey, look, Granny, it's late, everybody's asleep.
You can level with me.
Uncle Phil's adopted, right?
Now, we're real proud of Zeke.
Did you know he won the Young Farmers of America Pig Raising trophy?
No, I didn't know that, but I'd love to have some details about that.
Won it four years running.
They had to retire his slop bucket.
Slop bucket?
I can't wait till he wakes up.
Respect your elders, son.
See, I beat you.
You know, he was the first Black president of the Young Farmers.
- Was that like a big thing?
- Oh, my, yes!
I beat you again.
You know, then, we also had those White rest rooms?
Yeah.
I remember this one time we was downtown and Zeke had had too much lemonade and suddenly he just lit out from me and split right into that White rest room.
They told him to leave, but little Zeke just stood his ground.
Uncle Phil did that?
Look here, I beat you again.
All right, that reporter's going to be here any minute.
Does everybody remember what they're supposed to say?
- Hilary?
- Yes, Daddy.
- Ashley?
- Yes, Daddy.
Vivian?
What is this, the von Trapp family?
I'm not about to parrot compliments for the benefit of some reporter.
Let's not be naive, Vivian.
I've dealt with the press before.
If you don't rehearse what you're going to say, they eat you alive.
Carlton?
At the forefront of the civil rights movement.
You were asleep, son.
Sorry, Dad.
All of Grandma's pies last night and waffles this morning.
I just crashed.
I've got the sugar blues.
I'm this close to a crying jag.
Ms. Melissa Klein, sir.
LA Press, "Urban Beat".
I'd like you to meet my family.
My wife Vivian my son Carlton, my daughters Hilary and Ashley.
Pleased to meet you.
So where's the photographer?
- Your father sent a picture in already.
- Am I in it?
- Yes, you are.
- Am I pretty?
Let's begin the interview, shall we?
Mr. Banks, you're best known as the lawyer who won the landmark housing discrimination case Winston vs.
Jones but our readers want to know about Philip Banks the man.
Well, I really don't like to blow my own horn.
Growing up on the mean streets of Baltimore, Maryland Philip Banks overcame great obstacles to win a scholarship to Princeton University in 1963.
You know, Hilary, Princeton was the turning point in Philip Banks' life.
It was then that he developed an interest in law and distinguished himself as a fine student earning himself a place at Harvard Law School.
That's right, Carlton.
But did you know that Philip Banks, in addition to becoming a partner of the prestigious law firm of Furth, Wynn, and Meyer remained active in the field of civil rights culminating in his crowning achievement in 1975 when he was elected to the board of the ASPCA.
ASPCA?
I think Ashley means NAACP.
Sorry, Daddy.
After living in Bel-Air, it was great to spend time at Disneyland to get back to reality.
Joe, it's 7:30.
We're getting to be a couple of night owls.
Yes, ma'am.
We better go put ourselves to bed.
Honey, I'm with you.
Good night, honey.
Feature desk, please.
Jake?
Melissa.
Look, I'm having second thoughts about this Philip Banks piece.
It's just one long, boring résumé.
For a while there, I thought I had an angle about the ASPCA but that turned out to be a blind alley.
I'm telling you, this man's life is boring.
His own son kept nodding out.
We better kill the story.
Okay.
Bye.
Hold up, lady.
My uncle has been looking forward to this all week.
If you kill that story, he's gonna get mad.
If he gets mad, the heat comes down on me.
Look, kid.
You got to wake up and smell the java.
Your uncle's dull.
Dull!
Dull?
Sweetheart, that's one thing my uncle is not.
Max out, lady.
I got a couple of stories for you.
Oh, dear.
- Good, Geoffrey.
You got the paper.
- Yes, madam.
Make sure you buy the 100 copies that Mr. Banks wanted.
Before we make such an investment, perhaps it might be wise for you to peruse the contents of this article.
Oh, dear.
Geoffrey, how on earth did they get a hold of all these stories?
Madam, the press is made up of a very low type of person.
You see what they've done to Fergie.
- Vivian, is it in the morning paper?
- Yeah.
Good.
You got the paper.
Why don't you have your morning coffee first, sir?
That's perfect.
I'll have my coffee, and you can read it to me, Geoffrey.
Yes, sir.
"Local lawyer wins prestigious award".
It goes on from there.
- Goes on to what?
- Just details, really.
- I'll just recycle this.
- Give it to me.
"The coveted Urban Spirit Award "given to Los Angeles' outstanding Black leaders "will be presented tonight to distinguished attorney Philip Banks".
This is well-written.
"Known to his barnyard companions as Zeke "Banks is no stranger to accolades.
"This ex-hog-handler "slopped his way to the top with the help of his trusted companion "Melvin the pig".
Who is responsible for this?
Hey, Uncle Zeke.
I got your 100 black and whites.
I can't believe this.
How did they get all these stories about the pig?
All right, I wasn't going to tell you, but - You!
- Will, honey run.
- What did I do?
- What did you do?
- You destroyed my image.
- I didn't destroy nothing.
Of course you did.
Look at that story.
I have to walk into that banquet room tonight filled with people who'll think I'm nothing but a hog-handling hick from Yamacraw.
- But that is where you come from, Zeke.
- Mama.
- I was just having a few words with Will.
- And I'm having a few words with you.
What have you got to be ashamed of?
We always put food on the table and clothes on your back.
Mama, I'm not ashamed.
There are just certain aspects of my life I don't wish emphasized.
Where I come from they call that being ashamed Mr. Big Shot!
Mother, you look very nice in your dress tonight.
- Did you enjoy the limousine ride, Pop?
- You bet.
I went Hattie, aren't you going to talk at all?
Come on.
We're mature adults.
Refusing to speak won't solve anything.
- That's right, Uncle Phil.
- I'm not talking to you.
Philip, Vivian, congratulations.
Yes, we're all quite proud of you at the office, old man.
Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my parents.
Hattie and Joe Banks, Henry and Margaret Furth.
Ma'am, would you like the salmon or chateaubriand?
We don't want to be a bother.
We'll just hang on to these empty plates.
Thank you kindly.
Are you sure you don't want any of the food?
We don't want to impose.
We'll just fade into the background.
- Breast or wing?
- I think I'll have a wing, thank you.
Got any okra casserole?
- Coming up.
- Granny.
You know how much Uncle Phil likes his mama's okra casserole.
- Why don't you ask him if he wants some?
- It ain't going to work, Will.
What is this interesting mélange?
It smells divine.
Just plain old okra and tomato, honey.
Delicious.
Try that, Henry.
Outstanding.
Do we have any biscuits?
I hope they're still hot.
Can I say something please?
I just know that at a time like this my uncle Phil is extremely happy to have his two loving parents here with him.
I can feel the love at this table.
Parents?
To hear him tell it, he just sprung full-grown from the ground and we had nothing to do with it.
Yes, he just sprung up like a big old eggplant.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, sir.
Aren't you Philip Banks?
- Yes.
You're the hog-slopping lawyer.
I saw your picture in the paper this morning.
Is Melvin going to be here tonight?
No, Melvin eschews these type of events.
I'm the same way.
What are you doing in here, Uncle Phil?
Is this for your own information, or will this be in USA Today?
Come on, I'm sorry I made you mad.
The reporter was gonna trash the article until I gave her those pig stories.
Yes.
Everyone loves those amusing little agricultural anecdotes.
I guess it never occurred to you that they'd make me look like a fool.
Uncle Phil, your plaid golf shorts make you look like a fool.
Those stories make you look great.
You did a lot for Black people that I didn't even know.
I raised a pig for the Young Farmers Association.
Puts me right up there with Martin Luther King.
You were the first Black president.
That's something.
And what about the Whites only rest room?
In case my mother didn't make it painfully clear I wasn't trying to prove a point.
- I went in there because I really had to go.
- I see a whole lot of that.
I mean, look, Uncle Phil, it's just like Rosa Parks.
When she sat in the front of the bus, she wasn't doing it to prove a point either.
She did it 'cause her feet hurt.
They told her to leave, and she didn't.
Neither did you.
I must be kidding myself.
I had it all planned out.
There was my family, all lined up to meet the press.
There I was, with my perfect image.
Philip Banks pulled himself up from the streets with his own bootstraps.
The only problem was, I didn't have it that hard.
I had two parents who loved me and were always there for me and worked hard to make sure I'd have everything they never had.
I mean, why are you worried so much about your image?
The truth sounds real good to me.
I don't think my mother will ever forgive me.
Man, you must be tripping.
Granny's great.
Just explain it to her.
Will, there's something you have to learn.
Sometimes parents just don't understand.
In addition to the civil rights cases he has won as an attorney Philip Banks is a community leader, an unsparing philanthropist and a role model to all citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, Philip Banks.
Thank you.
I grew up on the streets of Baltimore.
But I was born on a farm in Yamacraw, North Carolina.
I was one of the lucky ones.
I had two wonderful parents who worked hard every day of their lives.
They couldn't give me a lot of material things but they gave me morals, courage and most important of all, love.
I just hope I can give the next generation what my parents gave me.
I hope he mentions his pig.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Geoffrey, have you seen Will?
Master William sits in his room sadly staring out of the window, madam quiet as a church mouse.
Hasn't spoken a word for hours.
What a shame.
Poor homesick baby.
I have an idea.
If Will is that homesick, let's send him home.
All he's been talking about is Philadelphia.
I hope these Philadelphia cheese steaks cheer him up.
I don't know what you and Will see in those vile concoctions.
Which is why you only ate five of them?
Will, we know you're homesick, so we got you something to cheer you up.
Thanks.
Oh, thanks a lot.
What is it?
It's a sandwich composed of cheese, steak, and a croissant de boulanger from the Café Antoinette in Beverly Hills.
It's a Philadelphia cheese steak, Will.
Nice try, Uncle Phil, but this is not a Philadelphia cheese steak.
See, look at the bag.
No grease stain.
If this were authentic, you could see right through the bag by now.
I'm sorry you don't like it.
I'll dispose of it later.
- I'll throw it out.
- I'll dispose of it, Ashley.
You know where you get the best cheese steaks in Philly?
Pat's Steaks on Passyunk Avenue.
Me and my buddy Ice Tray used to go there every Friday.
We used to steal I mean, we would enjoy them there often.
Ice Tray?
Isn't he the one you're always talking about?
Did I ever tell you about the story in the middle of the winter?
Ice Tray grabbed onto the back of a bus and it was so cold, his face got stuck.
And he was dragged around the city.
He couldn't get off till he hit a bump on the Ben Franklin Bridge.
That's a story we can all relate to.
Cut it out, Philip.
He misses his friend.
Ice Tray's more like my big brother, though.
I've got a good idea.
Why don't we fly him out for a weekend visit?
You mean it, Aunt Viv?
I'm down with that.
Word up.
This is gonna be cold stupid on the serious tip.
What did you say, young lady?
I said that this is quite an exceptional idea, Daddy.
Peachy-keen, even.
Later, my man.
Wonderful.
First Will, now Ashley.
I can't wait till Ice Box gets here.
No, it's Ice Tray, Uncle Phil.
Ice Tray.
I apologize.
Ice Box would be an idiotic name.
Yeah, it would.
Aunt Viv, this is going to be great.
I can't wait to show him all the strange sights of L.A. I don't even know where to begin.
I'll take him to Disneyland, to Marineland - Dad, I need $200.
- I'll take him to Hilaryland.
- Why do you need $200, Hilary?
- For books.
I'm changing my major.
- To what?
- Communications.
Exactly what does that entail?
You know, it's like communications.
It's, like, the study of communicating, okay?
- Why do you want to major in that?
- Because I'm good at it.
So I presume this is the official Ice Tray greeting party.
- Tray!
- Prince!
Homey, get in there.
Guys, you're going to hurt each other.
That's okay, Vivian.
Let's see where this goes.
Ice Tray, we didn't hear you come in.
Geoffrey, did you leave the door open?
- Well, no.
- I guess we must have left it unlocked.
"Well, no".
You still got it, man.
Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.
Will, why don't you introduce Ice Tray to your family?
I'm sorry.
This is my little cousin Ashley.
- Hi.
- This is my bodyguard, Geoffrey.
All of this is my Uncle Phil.
Remember we used to say that Daffy Duck must have a little brother somewhere?
Meet my cousin Carlton.
Can't touch this.
Geoffrey, would you take Ice Tray's luggage to his room?
Certainly, madam.
So you're also a disadvantaged inner-city youth, I hear.
- Yo, man, what's with him?
- It's a tan.
- What up on the schoolyard?
- School, man.
- I don't bother it, and it don't bother me.
- You don't go to school, Ice Tray?
Sure I do.
I've been held back in the 10th grade three times in a row.
Three times?
See, my motto is, when I find a grade I like, I stick with it.
Education is the mortar that builds the temple of success.
- That's what I personally think.
- Like who cares?
What's up with Smooth, Jocko, and O-Money?
Smooth and Jocko got their own singing group now.
And O-Money got his hair cut to look like the Chrysler Building.
That's good, though, man.
That Mount Rushmore thing was not working.
This is dope, man.
I'll just kick back here for a few days, let somebody else do all the work.
Excuse me, young man.
In this house, everyone carries his own weight.
Too easy.
Come on, Daddy.
Tray's on vacation.
See, my motto is Lord, if there's anything like work around my heart, please remove it.
I smell something greasy.
Too easy.
A cheese steak!
This is the real deal.
Yo, man.
Could I get $100?
- For what?
- To pay the limo dude.
You took a limo?
Prince said y'all was loaded, and when in Rome, do as.
- $100?
- I got a cash flow problem.
You see, my Korean Gucci bags, they just ain't been moving lately.
Tray, let's pay the dude.
What's up with the Blake sisters, they still live on 43rd St.?
Yeah, man, they got their own 900 number now.
He's some piece of work.
We're getting a rottweiler.
I know he seems rough around the edges but we should all give him a chance.
When you really look at it, how different is Ice Tray from Carlton?
With all due respect, Mom, I think he's a little fonder of the 10th grade than I. Hold up.
What about that one girl you went out with that Latiqua?
Man, that girl was ugly.
- Ugly?
You crazy, man.
- She was so ugly, she was oogly.
She was so ugly, Freddy Krueger had nightmares about her.
At least she was smart.
- That girl you was with - Stacy.
That girl was so dumb, it took her an hour to cook Minute Rice.
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about skinny girls.
- Who's skinny?
- That Julie you went out with?
She was so skinny, you could tie a rope around her head and use her like a tetherball pole.
Hold it.
Back to Stacy.
Stacy was so dumb.
Do you know how dumb Stacy was?
- How dumb was Stacy?
- Stacy was so dumb that she took the Pepsi Challenge and chose Jif.
This is dope, man.
Look at this.
Crystal, china dolls, a book.
You know people are rich when they got all this stuff they got no use for.
Crime and Punishment.
That's just some tired old book Carlton's reading.
Really?
"From the library of Master William Smith".
Who's tired now, homey?
They're forcing us to read that at school.
I ain't gonna read it.
Wait.
This is your handwriting.
"Intriguing duality"?
Same old Prince, man.
When I first met you, you was carrying books in a pizza box so nobody knew you were studying.
That was cool, till them guys jumped me, trying to steal my pizza.
Yo, they was upset.
You got a good deal here, homey.
Don't blow it.
- I'll go grab us some cheese steaks.
- All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Vivian, I think you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.
Tell me the story again.
And this time, just the facts.
I'll give you a transcript, Philip.
Tray: "Hi".
Hilary: "Hi".
I don't get it.
What could she possibly see in him?
He's got a nice smile, and cool hair.
Hair?
I thought it was a hat.
I think I should have gotten a larger tattoo, Tray.
Tattoo?
- I got a tattoo of Tray's initials.
- Where?
Don't worry, Mrs. Banks.
No one will ever see it.
I'm gonna go put this stuff up in my bedroom.
- I'll go with you.
- So will I. Aunt Viv, you got to be proud of yourself.
Pride doesn't quite capture it, Will.
It was your idea to bring Tray out here.
Hilary used to walk around all the time with such a sour look on her face.
I used to say to myself, she just needs one good friend.
He does seem like an interesting young man.
You've only seen one side of him.
He's joking around, but he can be serious.
Really?
Seriously.
If somebody's chasing him, he can jack a fence like that.
But if somebody catch him, it don't matter.
The boy got a crazy rabbit punch, like you don't even see it coming.
You out of there.
Let's go check out that swimming pool, Prince.
- See you later, babe.
- Okay, Icy.
It's nice to see you and Ice Tray getting along.
I'm sorry he couldn't stay longer.
Don't worry, I've got it all figured out.
He can come visit every other weekend.
When the 10th grade lets out, he can come stay in the pool house.
Daddy can get him a job at the office.
What job could he have in the law firm?
I don't know.
Lawyer?
Anyways, Mom, don't worry.
This is our problem, not yours.
The only thing I want to say is thank you.
For what?
You, like, saw right past his rough-tough exterior and you welcomed him into our home.
I'm so proud of you, Mom.
I just want to share my joy with you.
I haven't been this happy since I bought my Giorgio Armani suit.
This is serious.
Hilary wants him to live in our pool house.
That shouldn't matter to you, Vivian.
You're the one who invited Ashtray.
In fact, why don't we invite some more of Will's friends out?
Let's just put a big neon sign out in front of the house that says "Homeboy Hotel".
That's it.
I want him out of this house.
You're making the classic mistake.
Don't you know that?
I have the perfect solution for dealing with Mr. Ice Pick.
- You do?
- My street savvy should not be taken lightly.
- She's rebelling against us.
- So?
So any hostility will only drive her closer to him.
We have to embrace him, welcome him into the family take him out for a nice meal, smother him with acceptance.
Once the element of rebellion is gone, the relationship will lose its appeal.
- What if that doesn't work?
- It'll work.
You two make such a lovely, lovely couple.
Dad, has Mom been drinking?
Nonsense, Carlton.
She's just being polite to our lovely houseguest.
Have you been drinking?
Tray, check this.
- That's dope, man.
- Let me see.
Nice catch, lady.
Oh, God, Tray, you are so funny.
Isn't he funny, everyone?
Not to me.
Of course, I'm sober.
I think escargots all around for starters.
- Snails.
- Oh, no.
I don't eat nothing that leaves a trail.
God, Tray, you slay me.
He busts me up.
Before we get started, I'd like to propose a toast.
Tray, since this is your last night here Vivian and I would just like to say that we're both extremely happy that Hilary's found that special someone, that special love.
I can just see Hilary and Tray in their tiny little love nest in Philadelphia with the pitter-patter of five little Ice Cubes.
Hilary changing diapers and preparing a lovely meal while her loving husband is working his night job on the corner as a Korean Gucci bag representative.
Hilary, this is for those wonderful years in Philadelphia.
I guess I'll be driving home tonight.
I am so happy.
Dad, are you saying that you wouldn't mind if Tray and I, like, got married?
Mind?
- Did you hear that, Vivian?
- Mind?
That's good, because Hilary and I got married this afternoon.
Hilary, no!
How could you do this to us?
How could you be so stupid?
Do you realize you've gone and ruined your life?
This boy doesn't care Mom, take it down 1,000.
It's only a joke.
We didn't get married.
We just wanted to see what you'd do.
See, baby, I told you they'd flip.
Homey, order me three steaks and a salad.
Come on, baby.
Let's dance.
Got married.
Sir, Master Tray's all packed and ready to depart.
Excellent, Geoffrey.
Let's afford him everything we can in getting him on his way.
Shall I call for a car, sir, or just shoot him out of a cannon?
So, that really is a wonderful restaurant, isn't it?
Yeah.
I think everybody had a good time, don't you?
I really enjoyed meeting Ice Tray this weekend.
Any time you want to invite any of your other friends, just let us know.
- You enjoyed it?
- Yeah, a lot.
Wasn't Hilary falling in love with Tray just the icing on the cake?
- I'm glad they had fun together.
- Me, too.
It's just a shame he had to leave before he had a chance to ruin her life.
- I'm sorry I said that, it's just that - But you meant it.
It was cool as long as Tray was some clown to come out here and bring me some cheese steaks and cheer me up.
Hold on.
The second you found out Hilary liked him, you wanted him out.
That's something I'd expect from Uncle Phil, not from you, Aunt Viv.
- Hilary is my daughter, Will.
- And Tray is my best friend.
We grew up together.
We're from the same neighborhood.
We're the same person.
If Tray's not good enough for this family, then maybe I'm not.
- You are not the same person.
- I know who I am.
No, you listen to me.
I can see why you like Ice Tray.
He's a lot of fun.
Everything's a joke to him.
School, work, people.
He doesn't care about anything.
He always managed to care about me.
I'm glad he's a good friend, but that doesn't change who he is.
I'm sorry, but a young man his age should be able to do something else besides fight and jump fences.
- You weren't there.
- I know, but still When I was in seventh grade, trying to bring books home from school the kids would jump me, so Tray started walking me home.
If he hadn't been there to throw those punches and help me jump fences then maybe I wouldn't be here.
While he was busy protecting your books, where the hell were his?
What's that got to do with anything?
I'm glad he cared so much about you.
But why doesn't he care as much about himself?
Because nobody was there for Tray.
If he hadn't been there to cover my back, maybe I wouldn't care about myself either.
And that would be an awful waste.
I shall load Mr. Tray's belongings into the cannon.
I mean cab, madam.
We miss you in the 'hood, homeboy.
Why don't you come on back with me?
No, I better cool out here, man.
If Uncle Phil woke up and I wasn't here, he'd have a nervous breakdown.
I'd recover, Will.
I'm really going to miss you, Ice Tray.
Bye, Mrs. Banks.
Thanks for inviting me.
We gotta do this again.
Have a safe trip back.
Take care of yourself.
Thanks.
Snap.
I almost forgot.
I got a little something for y'all.
- That's our china dog.
- Yeah.
I figured y'all were so nice to me and everything that I don't need it.
That was a joke.
You've become a part of my spirit that's never been touched before.
I feel a oneness with you, and now that you're leaving I just have this sense that life will be empty, hollow, and meaningless.
Peep this, babe.
See, I have this first-class ticket.
We could go down to the airport and trade it for two coach tickets and you could come back to Philly with me.
What do you think?
Coach?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Thank you, Geoffrey.
- Mom.
- It's only a weekend.
Besides, at your age, you should be able to baby-sit your little sister.
Why can't Geoffrey baby-sit her?
Because we're giving him the weekend off.
You mean I'm going to have to get my own breakfast, too?
Am I being punished for something?
I was just asking myself that same question.
But, Dad, I'm only nine.
Can't Hilary take care of herself?
Hi, Hilary.
Ashley, you be a good girl while we're in Palm Springs.
Well, I'm in a bad mood, and somebody is going to suffer.
Please take me with you.
If I could, sweetie, I'd put you in my pocket but this retreat is just for members of the law firm and their spouses.
No kids allowed.
Man, this is going to be hype.
Yo, Palm Springs, the home of the dental floss bikini.
Will, before you get your mojo working I think there's something you should know: You're not going.
You better tell that to my mojo because his bags is packed.
That's Henry and Margaret.
Geoffrey, would you get that, please?
Right away, sir.
I shall tend to my hernia a bit later.
Uncle Phil, I don't think you want to leave me here all weekend with no adult supervision.
Did you see that movie House Party?
No.
Did you see The Terminator?
Mr. and Mrs. Furth.
Kids, the limo's waiting.
We'll drive right to the helicopter.
- Helicopter?
- I just got my license.
My man, Henry.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could have your car with you in Palm Springs?
What if you could find a nice, responsible young man to drive it there for you?
Will, that's a super idea.
Carlton, you're a nice, responsible young man.
And you're an eminent, respected attorney and your wife is a dazzling beauty.
Yo, G. Did you leave a vacuum cleaner on?
I just heard a loud sucking noise.
Carlton, old sport would you like to drive my Mercedes to Palm Springs this weekend?
You could hang around the retreat, play some golf You know, the chicks in Palm Springs wear the skimpiest of bikinis.
I sure could use a good game of golf.
Good show.
See you there.
Okay, everybody.
Last one in the chopper is a rotten egg.
- See you, kiddo.
- Be good.
Okay.
Take care.
- See you, Dad.
Have a good trip.
- Okay, son.
Why so glum, chum?
It was my idea for me to drive his car to Palm Springs.
How come he asked you to do it?
This is a Black thing, isn't it?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA FRESH Plans for Palm Springs.
One: Work on golf swing.
Two: Review SAT practice book.
Three: Ask Mr. Furth about a summer internship.
Four: Get the stick out of your butt!
Way to go, Will.
You almost made us crash.
What do you think you're doing here anyway?
Come on, just relax.
Pretend I'm not even here.
Gladly.
What you eating?
For crying out loud.
Can I have some?
All right, Will.
I'll share my snack with you on one condition.
When we get to Palm Springs, you'll behave like a proper gentleman and try to maintain some sense of decorum and etiquette.
- Understood?
- Yeah.
Good.
What do you say to an Oreo?
I say, "What's up, Carlton"?
I can't believe we're lost.
What's the name of this street?
"Arguello Drive".
Maybe that'll get us back to the freeway.
Here, let me check.
No, man.
No freeways.
Carlton, look out!
A low bridge!
Look, thanks a lot, man.
Now we got to go back and get my head!
And I really liked that head.
Can the yuck fest, Will.
We're lost.
And it's all your fault.
You the one who ain't bring no map.
- You had to go to the bathroom.
- You're the one that gave me that Shasta.
- Is that the police?
- Punch it, man.
We're in a Benz.
Are you crazy?
I call this a lucky break.
A policeman is our pal.
We can ask him for directions.
Listen to me, when he comes up, keep your hands on the wheel.
- Good evening, Officer.
Carlton Banks.
- Keep your hands on the wheel.
- Where are you headed?
- We're going to Palm Springs.
And you?
Where are you headed this fine evening?
Good job.
Now he's gonna want to see your license.
Right.
Can I see your license?
My license?
I have to warn you this picture was taken without my contacts.
And the height is a typo, I'm actually a lot taller.
Fool, this is not The Love Connection.
- Vehicle registration, please.
- Just a sec.
But the thing is, Officer, this isn't my car.
- Get out of the car.
- What?
He's going to tell us to get out of the car.
- You watch too much TV.
- Get out of the car.
Officer, honestly, I don't see the need to Hey, out of the car now.
Hey, Carlton.
Thanks to you we're already an hour late to bikini land.
So when they interrogate us, which they like to do keep all your answers short and sweet.
Will, I know how to handle this.
I'm pre-law.
Okay, fellas, let's start at the beginning.
- Where are you from?
- LA.
- Not exactly - Next question, please.
Let's hear what your friend has to say.
Actually we come from Bel-Air.
In fact, we live two houses away from the Reagans.
We have the same pool man.
And where were you headed to?
- The desert.
Next question, please.
- Not just the desert.
Palm Springs.
We're going to a legal retreat at Henry Furth's villa.
He's my father's partner and the owner of the car we're driving.
He is, is he?
Then why didn't he drive it himself to Palm Springs?
Because his wife flew everybody in her helicopter.
Okay, fellas, we've had a lot of car thefts in the area lately.
- You want to talk about it?
- Okay, I think it's terrible.
You making fun of me, kid?
You're the one who wanted to talk about it.
Quite frankly, I think it's a matter for the police to handle.
Carlton, they're handling it now.
What on earth are you talking about?
They think we stole the Benz.
Officers, let me call Henry Furth.
He's the owner of the car.
He'll straighten everything out.
Sure.
And while you're at it you might want to give Ron and Nancy a ring-a-ding-ding.
Come on.
It is up!
It's up!
Yes!
You bum.
You miserable bum!
What a great game.
Would you get that, honey?
- Hello?
- May I speak to Philip Banks?
Thanks?
For what?
No, I said, "Philip Banks".
Can I speak to him?
I don't see him.
He must have stepped out.
Can you call back later?
No.
Is Mr. Furth there?
Yes.
This is Mrs. Furth.
Mrs. Furth, this is Carlton Banks.
Carlton, how are you, dear?
You've got to get a message to my father.
It's very important.
I'm in jail.
Yale?
Marvelous.
I've got to go now.
See you soon, dear.
Philip, Vivian, Carlton just called.
- Is everything all right?
- I should say so.
He got into Yale.
Yale?
That's my alma mater.
Carlton's only a sophomore.
He's not applying to college yet.
You know Margaret.
I'm sure she got it wrong.
It probably wasn't Yale or Carlton.
It probably wasn't even the phone.
I'm not getting back in that helicopter with her.
It's all right, man.
Chill.
I get a phone call, too.
C, it's all right.
Chill.
Get it.
SHE Hilary, you're sitting right next to the phone.
I don't care.
I'm your babysitter.
I command you.
Phone.
Let me know if it's for me.
But, Miss Hilary, I'm off duty.
And you're sitting right next to the phone.
Yeah, but you're facing the phone.
Lazy House.
G, what up?
This is Will, man.
I need a big favor.
I'm tired of doing favors for you spoilt children.
I'm off duty.
I am not an animal.
Yo, man.
I need another phone call.
My butler hung up on me.
Okay, fellas.
You want to talk about those other car thefts?
I don't think you know who you're talking to.
I have a 3.95 grade point average which would have been 4.0, except I had to take a ceramics class and my pot exploded in my kiln.
I'm going to go to Harvard Law School, graduate with honors and then I'm going to sue you blind.
Now give us another phone call.
I think he likes you.
This is terrible.
I'm ruined.
I'll be kicked out of the glee club, I won't get into Princeton.
I won't be admitted to the bar.
Neither will I. The cops took my fake ID.
Come on, man, don't give me that my-dog-is-dead face.
- Come on, let's sing.
- I'm not singing.
This is just retarded.
Come on, man, let it go.
You'll feel better.
Yo, that was dope, Bob.
Take five?
We got to get out of here, man.
- That big dude is making me nervous.
- Why?
Any time you see a White guy in jail, you know he did something bad.
We got to get a message to Uncle Phil.
He's a lawyer, he'll get us out of here.
But they won't give us any more phone calls.
Not that it matters.
The game was on so loud, Mrs. Furth couldn't even hear what I said.
- The game?
- Yeah, the football game on TV.
That's all they do at these retreats.
All right, we out of here.
I got an idea.
- Yo!
- Yeah.
My buddy here is ready to confess.
Come on!
Look at this!
- He's going for a touchdown!
- Go!
We interrupt this game for a special report.
You bum!
This is Steve Goddard of the Minuteman-21 news team at the Santa Juanesta police station.
The recent rash of car thefts in the Palm Springs area has been solved, as the perpetrators were arrested this evening.
The ringleader agreed to confess only if a camera crew were present to broadcast live.
What you are about to see is a Minuteman-21 news exclusive.
Yeah, we done it.
Word to Big Bird.
We flicked eight Benzitos, 15 Jags, and a Maserati!
But I didn't like the upholstery so I took it back, Jack!
Do you have anything to say?
Dad.
- Aunt Viv!
- Dad!
Who's in charge here?
- I am.
- Let those kids out.
- These kids are car thieves.
- You have made a big mistake.
I don't know how you got that bogus confession out of them but those two boys haven't stolen a thing from anyone.
This is the biggest amateur operation I have seen since Mayberry R.F.D. - Could you ask your wife to calm down?
- Calm yourself, Barney Fife.
Vivian, please.
Officers, I'm sure we can clear this whole matter up quite easily.
Could you please sit down?
We're busy now.
Honey, we're about to get very busy.
- Sit down!
- Hey!
You don't talk to my wife like that.
Who the hell do you think you're talking Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- What's going on?
- May I help you, sir?
I'm Henry Furth.
Good news.
Your car is safe and sound.
And we've got the perpetrators.
Those aren't the perpetrators.
Those are my partner's son and nephew.
Partner?
Legal partner.
I've got a few questions for you.
When you got this alleged confession from them did they have a lawyer present?
No.
Because I'm their lawyer.
Did you notify their parents?
No.
Because we're their parents.
So, Officer, don't tell us to wait.
And don't tell us to sit down.
Just open that damn cell and let those two boys out or I'll tie this place up with so much litigation that your grandchildren are gonna need lawyers!
Open the cell, Jerry.
Peace out, Bob.
POLICE Geoffrey, I want a duck salad.
When exactly do you go back on duty?
When your parents walk through that door and not a moment sooner.
Hi.
We're home.
Drat.
Hilary, how did everything go with Ashley?
Mother, she was a little angel.
She polished my nails and cleaned out my closet.
To reward her, we went to this café that's owned by John Cougar Mellencamp Kim Basinger, and Doogie Howser's business manager.
And we spent the afternoon drinking espresso.
You let Ashley drink espresso?
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Dad!
Let's go play!
Come on, everybody, let's go play!
Not tonight, sweetie, we kind of had an exhausting weekend.
- What happened?
- We got arrested.
- Arrested?
- By who?
The fashion police?
No.
The police thought we stole Mr. Furth's car.
But they were just trying to do their jobs.
Why did they think you stole it?
Hilary, we've been over that all weekend.
It's late.
I think we all should go to bed.
I don't want to.
I want to play Monopoly, I want to jump up.
Let's go paint my room!
Geoffrey, some warm milk, please.
- Yo, Carlton.
- Yeah?
Those cops were just trying to do their jobs?
Don't get all bent out of shape.
You didn't learn anything this weekend.
I most certainly did.
Always bring a map.
What?
If we would have had a map we wouldn't have to drive 2 miles an hour to find a freeway entrance and we wouldn't have been stopped.
Okay.
I get it now.
We were stopped because we were driving too slow.
We were breaking the slowness limit.
Okay, I've never heard of that law before.
But I did hear this other law.
It's the "if you see a Black guy driving anything but a burned-out Pinto "you better stop him because he stole it" law.
I heard about that one.
But I thought it was "the Black guy law" when in actuality, it was the "slowness limit law".
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Good night.
- They were just doing their job.
- Good night, Carlton.
What's your complaint here?
We were detained for a few hours Dad cleared things up, and we were released.
The system works.
I hope you like that system 'cause you'll be seeing a lot of it in your lifetime.
Not if I bring a map.
You just don't get it, do you?
No map is going to save you, and neither is your glee club or your fancy Bel-Air address or who your daddy is.
When you're driving in a nice car in a strange neighborhood none of that matters.
They only see one thing.
Maybe growing up where you did has made you a little touchy but I think you've blown this thing out of proportion.
If you look at the facts Carlton, it's late.
- It's a school day tomorrow, son.
- Yeah, okay, Dad.
It was awfully nice of Mr. Furth to help us out.
I'll have to write him a thank-you note.
It shouldn't have happened in the first place, son.
Good night.
Dad.
If you were a policeman and you saw a car driving 2 miles an hour wouldn't you stop it?
I asked myself that question the first time I was stopped.
Good night, son.
I would stop it.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Come on.
Vogue with me, baby.
Look, Geoffrey.
We're voguing.
And what is the precise nature of this nervous disorder?
It's for people that want to look cool but ain't really got no rhythm.
You should be good at it.
Come on, strike the pose.
Unhand me, you ruffian.
Will, please.
Don't you have anything better to do than to annoy Geoffrey?
Yeah, but Carlton ain't home yet.
That's right.
Do you have any idea what he does after school?
Window-shop at Randy's Short and Small?
Carlton belongs to three different after-school clubs.
I belong to the home shopping club.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, love.
- How was your day?
- Fine, until I ran into the man of leisure.
Will doesn't think he needs any after-school activities.
If you sit around the house all afternoon and never develop any outside interests you'll become a very, very shallow person.
And you won't get into any of the good nightclubs.
I'll never meet Lisa Bonet.
That's right.
You have so many talents.
Why not join an after-school club?
Aunt Viv, I ain't really down with staying at an all-boys school after dark.
All right, then.
I think you should get an after-school job.
Bring on the clubs.
It's officially after school.
Go find the club of your choice.
If I had the club of my choice, you'd be lying on the floor unconscious.
A girl?
Where did that come from?
Didn't you know?
We share our extra-curricular activities with the girls from our sister school.
Lead me to the sisters.
I'm ready to get extracurricular.
Yo, Will.
Slap me 10.
You know, I finally rented the movie Glory last night.
Denzel was incredible.
The South, man.
I don't know.
We got to do something about it.
- What's up, Mr. Fellows?
- Call me Ned.
You need another member of this poetry club?
Will, solid.
We could really use a representative of the Black male urban experience.
More specifically, the handsome Black male urban experience.
Everyone, the meeting's about to begin.
Will you please take your seats?
I'd like to open this meeting with a reading from the poem Daddy by Sylvia Plath.
Daddy.
"Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You "Every woman adores a Fascist "The boot in the face, the brute "Brute heart of a brute like you" Sylvia Plath killed herself shortly after writing this poem.
If she didn't, her daddy would have.
Who are you?
This is my main man Will Smith, newest member of our poetry club.
Will, Christina Johnson.
And we are so glad to have you.
It's such a thrill to see a man from Bel-Air Academy not afraid to share our love of poetry.
Thanks, Christina.
Yo, on with the love sharing.
You can start by reading a poem for us.
- I didn't bring one.
- What a shame.
There's nothing that moves me more than hearing a poem recited in a deep, sensual, masculine voice.
I got a poem.
- Who's it by?
- He's a street poet.
He's a friend of mine.
His name is Raphael de la Ghetto.
Raphael de la Ghetto.
I don't think I've ever heard of him.
I have.
You have?
I stay pretty current, bro.
Isn't he one of those street poets from south central LA?
Yeah.
Same guy.
Will, the floor's yours.
Floor's yours.
You're a poet and you don't know it.
I am a poet and I do know it.
Why don't you recite your poem?
All right.
Ladies, my poem is called Tick Tock Clock by Raphael de la Ghetto.
"Tick tock clock "The clock is ticking for you "'Cause the love you said you'd give "Came up way past due "So dance to the clock rock "Stay on the floor "'Cause when the ticks turn to tocks "I'll be knocking at your door" That was incredible.
And very typical of de la Ghetto's work.
Listen, everybody, let's take a break while I go fire up the cappuccino maker.
That poem was brilliant.
De la Ghetto uses a lot of metaphor.
No, baby, he used to.
He went to the clinic.
He's straight now.
I'd love to hear more of de la Ghetto's poems.
As a woman, I find his work so passionate, so raw so exciting.
When I hear those words my body just quivers crying out for more.
Poetry is good.
"Love by Raphael de la Ghetto".
"Burnin' Love by Raphael de la Ghetto".
Master William, Mr. Jazz is here to see you.
Yo, what up, J?
What's up, man, I got this new Ice Cube tape.
It's dope!
I ain't got enough time for that.
I got to finish writing this poem.
Poem?
Then what you going to do, bake some cookies?
Hem a dress?
Shut up.
I'm doing it to get this girl.
Listen to what I got so far.
I just need one last line.
"My love for you is like a river "Like a summer breeze That makes my soul shiver "One look from you Is more precious than gold" Let's go get some barbecue and get busy.
What kind of line is that?
It always works for me.
I hear someone in this room likes poetry.
Try this one on for size.
"Roses are red Violets are blue "Pansies are poets Will, tell me it isn't true" That's funny.
I got a poem for you, Carl.
Try this one on for size.
"Roses are red Violets are blue "Jazz and I are Black, But Carlton, what are you"?
Master William I applaud your new interest.
Poetry is one of my great loves.
I won first prize at the old Devonshire poetry recital of 1963.
You should have been there.
The crowd rose to its feet shouting, "Encore"!
That's interesting "Cannon to the right of them "Cannon to the left of them "Cannon in front of them "Volleyed and thundered" You need a last line for that?
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
So, young man, how'd it go at school today?
- I joined the poetry club.
- Excellent.
I remember when I got interested in poetry.
So who's the girl?
I'm starving.
When do we eat here?
We eat here later.
You eat here never.
Looks like you eat here often.
Hi, Will.
Where's your uncle?
He's throwing Jazz out the house again.
Okay.
Here are those poetry books you wanted.
I used them in the Freshman Lit class I taught last year.
If you have any questions about poetry, just ask me.
Yeah, I have a question.
I understand why guys get into poetry.
To get girls.
But why do girls like poetry?
Because girls think with their brains.
Miss Christina Johnson.
This is my Aunt Viv and this is my cousin Ashley.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
You'll have to excuse us.
Will, I've got a poem.
- "Will and Christina sitting in a tree" - Beat it.
They seem really nice.
Yeah.
They mean well.
But the only people I'm really comfortable with are my friends.
The dead poets.
- Care to sit?
- Thanks.
You know, I can't get de la Ghetto's poem off my mind.
He is a genius, isn't he?
Do you really, really know him?
Yeah.
We're like brothers.
Tell me.
What's he like?
He's a kind of a strange guy.
His girl left him back in the '60s and he never changed his clothes.
Wears the same old dashiki and monster afro.
- That's such a sad story.
- I know.
When I think about poor Raphael it makes me wonder if a woman could ever really care about a man.
I'm glad you know him so well, because I have a favor to ask you.
Anything.
Could you bring Raphael to poetry night?
- Excuse me?
- We have it at school once a month.
Usually club members get up and recite their poetry.
I'm in charge of it this month and I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we had a real poet"?
I don't know.
Raphael doesn't like to leave the house.
You wouldn't either if you had the same dashiki on for 20 years.
Could you just ask him, Will?
I'd be so grateful.
- I could ask him, but I'm sure he'll say no.
- Please try, Will.
It would mean so much to me.
Yo, he'll be there.
- I'm glad you're here.
- You sounded kind of clutch on the phone.
I'm in big trouble.
I promised Christina I'd have a famous poet at school tonight.
I'm connected, but I don't know any famous poets.
I need somebody to pretend to be a famous poet.
I'll be home about 6:00, Geoffrey.
Is that your uncle?
I'm tired of those grass burns.
- Good morning, Will.
- Good morning.
- Better get ready for school.
- Okay.
We're really looking forward to poetry night tonight.
- How did you hear about it?
- Your teacher Mr. Fellows called.
He's calling all the parents of Bel-Air Academy.
No, Aunt Viv.
- You guys can't go.
- But I love poetry.
Wait a minute, now, Vivian.
Let's be a little sensitive here.
Will only joined the poetry club because he had a crush on Christina.
If we show up, we'll cramp his style.
Okay.
You're right.
Will, good luck tonight.
- Thanks for understanding.
- Are you kidding?
I just didn't want to get stuck at some boring poetry night.
Is he gone yet?
Did you hear any of that?
This is getting out of control.
I need a phony poet tonight.
What does he have to do?
He just has to have a big afro, a dashiki and stand in front of a crowd and read some stuff I'll write.
He has to be able to read?
Yes, Jazz.
That'll cost you two extra Jacksons, but I know a guy.
He's a sidewalk jewelry salesman so he has free nights.
But he'll need $60 cash in advance.
- $60?
Are you tripping?
All I got is $20.
- He'll take it.
Here's an extra $10.
Get me a Rolex.
I just can't believe it.
Raphael de la Ghetto at Bel-Air Academy.
Yes.
I'm looking forward to seeing him again.
Will, is Raphael here yet?
No.
He'll probably be a little late.
He likes his audience to be a little hostile.
It's okay if he's running a little late.
I just wrote a new poem and I'm anxious to share it.
Will, this is our night.
Bringing Raphael de la Ghetto here tonight is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
I'm feeling really close to you right now.
I don't know how to thank you.
You don't have to thank me.
But, Will, I want to after the reading.
Will's gonna get thanked!
What are you guys doing here?
It's after dark, Master William.
I thought it wise to drive the young ladies to ensure that they arrived safely.
Are there any women my age here?
- But why did you two come?
- Are you kidding?
We heard the buzz about this event on Melrose.
I cannot believe your dinky, little school got Raphael de la Ghetto to come.
Why didn't you tell me it was poetry night?
You know what a great lover of literature I am.
I've never seen you read nothing.
That's right.
I suppose I just get my horoscope out of the air.
Jazz, where is the poet?
Locked up in the steel hotel.
Cops caught him with a fistful of toy Rolexes.
Yo, let's get out of here.
Jazz, I can't go.
After this, I'm getting thanked.
Ode to Judy.
"Unfinished Sunday Times puzzle "Lying limp on the hardwood floor "The society page spread open "My coffee is cold "It seems you are engaged "To a prominent investment banker "Prominent for what?
"I'd very much like to know" We better go.
This crowd will get ugly if they got to listen to much more of that.
The audience is growing restless.
Where is this de la Ghetto fellow?
I really stepped in it this time.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
What's wrong?
There is no Raphael de la Ghetto.
I made him up.
I just wanted to impress Christina.
I even had Jazz hire a phony poet to come tonight, but the dude didn't show up.
There was extenuating circumstances.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, G. Christina is a very, very nice girl.
If she finds out I lied to her, she may never even speak to me again.
Everyone, I'm sorry for the delay but the big moment has finally come.
I'd like to present the man responsible for this evening's event Mr. Will Smith.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Raphael de la Ghetto.
"Listen "To the street beat "Hear the sound pound "Plug your ears "Mask your fears "Something weird's going down "So listen to the street beat "Listen to the box shock "Listen, or I'll kill you" That was heavy, man.
Let's have another one.
Encore.
"Cannon to the right of them "Cannon to the left of them "Cannon in front of them "Volleyed and thundered" - Hilary, isn't that your butler?
- Yeah.
It's a good look for him.
"Came through the jaws of Death" Silence, you ungrateful children.
When you're ready to be quiet and listen, I shall return.
That was your butler.
Look, baby, let me explain.
You don't even know de la Ghetto.
I can't believe anything you've said to me.
You're nothing but a liar.
My man Will ain't no liar.
Who are you?
I am Raphael de la Ghetto.
Where's your afro?
And where's your dashiki?
I worked all that out in therapy.
I don't know who to believe anymore.
How do I know you're the real Raphael de la Ghetto?
Listen.
"My love for you is like a river "Like a summer breeze That makes my soul shiver "One look from you Is more precious than gold "Let's go get some barbecue And get busy" Tell me more.
Works every time.
"Cannon to the left of them "Cannon to the right of them" I'm sorry I missed that.
So Jazz went out with Christina.
That's cool, though, baby.
I'm a poet, and it's a lot more ink in this pen.
I think you have a talent for poetry.
I was just playing around with that stuff.
But the poem that you wrote got a standing ovation.
That's right, and it got me a date.
The other one you wrote got Jazz a date.
The one I got out of your wastebasket got me a date.
Mommy, I'd like to hear a poem.
Could you read us one?
Okay.
This is a poem that your father and I especially love.
It's by Amiri Baraka.
It's called Three Modes of History and Culture.
"I think about a time "When I will be relaxed "When flames and nonspecific passion "Wear themselves away "And my eyes and hands And mind can turn "And soften "And the songs will be softer "And weight the air" If you'd like to learn more about poetry, you can reach us at Psych.
We just kidding.
Good night, y'all.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Have mercy.
What's that, Jody?
Yeah, you can pick me up at 8:00, baby.
Yes, lord.
Your red tube top.
Asking out magazines, Will?
I don't know.
Even paper products have some standards.
What's that, Jody?
No, that's as tall as he'll ever be.
Hilary, you know I don't like wearing costumes.
But, dad, I'm coming to Hilary's party as a ballerina.
That's the one thing I wanted to come as.
And it's taken?
So sorry.
Please, daddy, I want my Halloween party to turn out really good.
Couldn't you wear a very tailored clown suit or something?
Go on, uncle Phil.
You just throw a hairpiece on and come as Mr. T. Yeah, dad.
We're all wearing costumes.
I have some bad news for both of you.
You're not invited.
Why not?
Every time I have a party, you spend all night hitting on my girlfriends.
Wait a minute, Hilary.
Everyone in the family is invited.
Besides, I'm sure Carlton and Will have dates.
- Yeah, of course.
- Oodles.
I guess all things are possible.
We better get going.
I need to get my costume and the mall closes in eight hours.
We all need costumes.
Let's go.
- Won't this be fun?
- No.
Come on, Philip.
Get in the Halloween spirit.
So, what's that, Carlton?
You do not have a date for tonight.
Like you do?
Who are you taking?
Page 42?
Carlton, all I have to do is walk in a mall, and I get any girl I want.
It's the law of nature.
It's called the survival of the handsomest.
Will, I don't even have to step into the mall.
Girls surround me in the parking lot and rip the doors off my car.
Would you like to put your money where your mouth is?
A betting man.
I bet you that I get a date and you don't.
This is a sucker bet, Will.
Within an hour, I'll have a gorgeous date and a great Halloween costume.
You better buy the mask first.
Yo yo yo, baby.
How about some fries to go with that shake?
?
Sorry, i'm in no fat head diet Xcuse me gurl, would you like to do the limbo under a coconut tree?
?
?
Will, do you mind railing in your tongue for one moment?
Now, before we all go our seperate ways i think it's right for me to determine where and when we all are gonna meet.
Now i think 5 o'clock should be enough time for all of us to shop for costumes We'll meet back at the car at 5 o'clock sharp.
Now get going Good luck And Hilary Keep an eye on your little sister Don't worry mom.
I see shopping at the mall as an educational experience for Ashley.
When i see more and more young people shopping by catalog.
Well, don't get me started Alright Phillip, i'll see you at the car at 5 o'clock with the costume?
Oh Jes Vivian, can't i wear a black robe and go as a good marshal?
Come on Philip, be creative Surprise me?
Ok.
How about Saturday O'Connor?
Alright Will.
Let the great pick-up contest begin Carlton, this is gonna be about as much of a contest as Mike Tyson versus Fred Savage.
Welcome to Croissants Aplenty.
I'm Cindy, your waitress.
Yo what's up, Cindy?
I'm Will and this is Carlton, my geek.
Cindy, we need a woman's point of view.
Which one of us do you find more attractive?
May I take your order?
I'll have the goat cheese and the prosciutto croissant.
Y'all got any ribs?
Okay, back to the bet.
A "date" is defined as a female who arrives at the party by midnight tonight.
And let me clarify something for you, Carlton: She has to be a human being.
I saw you looking in the pet store.
Hilary!
!
!
Stop by later.
We have just got a stretch velvet suit that has your name written all over it.
Be sure to hold it for me Ramon.
Love you Hilary, I really don't think this store's gonna have my ballerina costume.
Ashley, you don't want to come to my Halloween party as a boring ballerina.
But, Hilary, I want to come in something pretty.
There.
You're Charlie Chaplin.
- Who is Charlie Chaplin?
- He was a silent movie star.
So take a hint.
Let's get my outfits.
"Outfits"?
How many costumes do you need?
At least five.
I'm going as a runway model.
- Anything I can help you with, sir?
- No, I'm just browsing.
Actually, I'm supposed to be shopping for a Halloween costume.
What's this?
It's one of those things for finding your lost keys?
Yes, but this one is totally new.
Are you constantly misplacing your keys?
Just touch the button on the locator unit, and the keyring emits a gentle beep tone - to alert you to the whereabouts.
- Nice, but what's new about that?
Suppose you misplace your primary locator unit.
Just use the equally handsome secondary unit and listen for the primary unit's own distinctive warbling.
That's a great idea.
- What's this?
- It's a Dynatronics audio habitat enhancer.
I could use one of those.
What does it do?
It produces a pleasant ocean sound, drowning out unpleasant noise pollution.
- You have that problem in your house?
- Boy, do I!
My wife's nephew.
The first week he moved in with us there was nonstop drumming in the house.
What the devil was that?
I believe the technical term is a rime shot.
Who did it?
Out of specalation of course, but my guess is master William.
Will.
Will!
!
!
!
Will!
!
!
!
Vivian.
What?
Ashley, honey where is your violin?
- Big Sal has it.
- Big Sal?
He owns this great store where you don't need any money.
You just go in and give him something you don't even want anymore - and he gives you this ticket.
Then - A pawnshop?
- You took her to a pawnshop?
- Yeah, it was really hard, too.
You don't have many pawnshops in Bel-Air.
That's really a shame.
- I had to go all the way to East LA.
- East LA?
- They gave me a great deal.
- They gave you a set of drums.
And I made them throw in a little gift for each of you.
Close your eyes.
- Vivian!
- I want my present.
Ok, open.
Oh Will, what a lovely antique necklace.
- What is this?
- Daddy, it's a diamond.
No, it isn't.
- You don't like it?
- No, I do not.
Can I have it?
How dare you pawn her violin!
- She don't even like playing it no more.
- She will learn to like it later.
A young woman who can play a violin is an accomplished young lady.
A girlie that can play the drums can write her own ticket.
Will, I want the best for Ashley.
When I was a kid, I loved classical music, but my parents couldn't afford lessons.
I used to stand out in the parking lot of the Philharmonic hoping to catch a spare note on the night air.
Philip, when I met you, you were into James Brown.
- He liked James Brown?
- He even wore his hair like him.
He had hair?
You know, it is possible to like both classical music and James Brown.
I could not agree more.
So let's let Ashley play whatever she wants.
She spent an entire year on the violin.
So if she wants to try something new, let her.
You tell him, Aunt Viv.
- And as for you, young man - Love you.
The next time you decide to visit a pawnshop Don't.
- Are we clear on that?
- Yes.
Master William, there is a young gentleman downstairs with a rather large radio who is here to see you.
- He claims his name is Jazz.
- Yo, word up.
Send him up.
- Now now, who is this Jazz fellow?
- I heard the boy at a club.
He was all of that.
He will be Ashley's new music teacher.
Mr. Jazz It's nice to meet you, Jazz.
How do you do?
I'm Mr. Banks.
You got that right.
Man, you're loaded!
Yo, what's up, J?
Come on, let's just leave them alone.
- I asked him to take her to her lesson - I know, baby.
Ash, how about letting Jazz get busy one time?
Excuse me, I'm looking for that store with the safari clothes.
I can't remember the name, but I think there's some produce in it.
- Banana Republic.
- That's it.
Thank you.
You know, you have a beautiful speaking voice.
You're probably a dynamite singer.
Well, I'm okay.
You want to record your own song?
$8.95.
I really have to shop for a Halloween costume.
That's too bad, because you're the first person I've met who I think could make a professional, quality recording.
You look like a woman with good taste.
- Hi, may I help you?
- I think so.
Tonight is my sister's Halloween party and I was wondering if you can honor me by showing me that pen.
Certainly.
This pen was manufactured in France.
It has a 14-karat gold nib and it's hand-lacquered.
The price is Do i look like the kind of man who would quibble about a few dollars?
That's very nice because most of my customers would be shocked at a pen that costs $300.
Aren't these dancers great?
You like dancers?
I think dancers are the sexiest guys in the whole world.
Word?
Yo baby, peep this.
The easy-to-read digital display keeps constant track of your pencil supply.
As you remove the pencils from the sturdy ABS plastic container the powerful micro-computer brain continuously updates the LED read-out and when the number reaches your preset re-supply level the pencil monitor alerts you to the shortage and reminds you to take action.
Only three pencils remain.
Proceed to stationery store immediately.
I'll take it.
I better get moving.
I'm sure my wife has picked out her costume by now.
Hi, Shauna.
I'd like to try these on.
Hilary, hi.
I didn't even see you come in.
I was just getting my overview of your new stock.
- It is all wonderful.
- Wait till you see what I've held for you.
Thank you!
It is so important to have friends in retail.
I've tried to explain that to my little sister.
Hilary, I'd love to meet her.
When are you gonna bring her in?
She's right here.
- Ashley, say hi to Shauna.
- Hello.
Anyway, I need some outfits for my Halloween party tonight.
That should be fun.
As long as my cousin Will doesn't ruin it.
You should have seen what he did at our last party.
Oh, my God!
Philip, don't make a big thing out of it.
If this is how he feels comfortable, he's not killing anybody.
Philip, aren't you going to introduce Will?
Introduce him.
Steve, David, Henry this is Will, my nephew by marriage.
Will, these are my partners in the law firm of Furth, Winn & Meyer.
Earth, Wind & Fire.
When's your next album coming out?
Will is going to go to Bel-Air Academy with Carlton.
Good for you, Will.
I used to fence at Bel-Air.
Really?
How much do you think we could get for that stereo?
- Will, there are other people at this table.
- Oh, you're right.
Any requests?
- Sweetie, would you say grace, please?
- Yes, mommy.
"Hey, there, Lord My name is Ashley Banks "My family and friends Want to give you some thanks "So before this dinner's All swallowed and chewed "Thank you, God, for this stupid food" Excuse me.
Let me see that hat.
Okay, but I don't think it works with that outfit.
- Did you pay for this?
- No, I guess I forgot to.
But you just had to have to it?
Me?
You've got to be kidding.
Derbies went out six months ago.
Let's take a little walk to the security office.
You can give me your fashion dos and don'ts there.
I knew I should have gone as a ballerina.
Okay, people, let's go.
Let's move along.
Nothing to see here.
No show.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Boys, I'd love to go to the Halloween party tonight but I can only go with one of you.
Okay.
Tough luck, Carlton.
Beat it, see you, scram, sayonara, peace out.
And so long, screwy.
Not so fast.
I don't even know you.
Count your blessings.
Now do you see, miss?
This is an example of the difference between the two of us.
I mean while Carlton snaps at every opportunity to take a cheap shot I'm the kindest, gentlest soul you'll ever want to meet.
Melinda, I'm nice to all people.
Young and old.
Like a couple weeks ago, Carlton's grandmother visited.
Who kept her company?
Not Carlton.
Me.
What are you doing up so late?
Child, I had to get up and get breakfast started.
I don't know what you all got that Geoffrey for.
- Five-card draw?
- Yeah, I'm with it.
You know granny, I really like you.
You and grandpa, you have fun.
You tell jokes.
- You all bust me up.
- Thank you, son.
Hey, look, granny, it's late, everybody's asleep.
You can level with me.
Uncle Phil's adopted, right?
Oh now, we're real proud of Zeke.
Did you know he won "The Young Farmers Of America Pig Raising" trophy?
No.
I didn't know that, but I'd love to have some details about that.
Won it four years running.
They had to retire his slop bucket.
Slop bucket?
I can't wait till he wakes up.
Respect your elders, son.
See, I beat you.
You know, he was the first black president of the Young Farmers.
- Was that like a big thing?
- Oh, my, yes!
I beat you again.
That was awfully sweet of you to play cards with her.
Sweet?
Well, some would say that, but it was just me being my thoughtful self.
Reality check.
This guy is far from thoughtful.
He's the most selfish, irresponsible person I have ever met.
A few weeks ago, I went on a car trip, and this guy caused all kinds of trouble.
Plans for Palm Springs.
One: Work on golf swing.
Two: Review SAT practice book.
Three: Ask Mr. Furth about a summer internship.
Four: Get the stick out of your butt!
Way to go, Will.
You almost made us crash.
What are you think you're doing here anyway?
Come on.
Just relax.
Pretend I'm not even here.
Gladly.
What you eating?
For crying out loud.
Can I have some?
All right, Will.
I'll share my snack with you on one condition.
When we get to Palm Springs, you'll behave like a proper gentleman and try to maintain some sense of decorum and etiquette.
- Understood?
- Yeah.
Good.
What do you say to an Oreo?
I say, "What's up, Carlton"?
He hid in the back seat?
It got worse.
Because of his antics, we got arrested and thrown in jail.
He's only telling one side of the story, Melinda.
When we were in jail, this boy cracked.
I had to do everything in my power to try to hold him together.
This is terrible.
I'm ruined.
I'll be kicked out of the glee club, I won't get into Princeton.
I won't be admitted to the bar.
Neither will I. The cops took my fake ID.
Come on, man, don't give me that my-dog-is-dead face.
- Come on.
Let's sing.
- I'm not singing.
This is just retarded.
Come on, man, let it go.
You'll feel better.
Melinda, I've been charitable so far, but now's the time to take off the gloves.
You don't know what a date with Will is like.
One evening, not so long ago, Will was walking a young lady home Yo, I told you, babe.
A date with me is a night to remember.
What'd you think of dinner?
Dinner?
It was just a Slurpee.
I did that for you, baby.
Keep that body of yours slim, trim, and ready for action.
Well, your hamburger and fries sure did look good.
Baby, that's man food.
It's getting awfully late, Will.
Shouldn't we take a cab?
Well, that's awfully expensive, baby.
Let's just walk down this dark alley.
All right, punk.
Your money or your girlfriend.
- My brother, you're making this too easy.
- Will!
Unhand her!
And who are you?
Banks.
Carlton Banks.
One second, Melinda, please.
Carlton, what the hell was that?
That never happened.
It could have.
Besides, when we made this bet there was nothing in the rules that said no lying.
Well, you know, two can play at that game.
Hey.
What were you two talking about?
I was just asking Carlton how long he's been a pathological liar.
And he said ever since he was the emperor of China.
- You mean, the story wasn't true?
- Of course not.
I'll tell you what a typical night with me is like Master William, you have a visitor.
A Mr. Jackson.
Come on, G. I don't have time for these interruptions.
I got homework forever.
Tell Michael I'll have to work on his dance steps later.
That's Bo Jackson.
Yo, what's up, babe?
Watch the handshake, man.
There goes baseball season.
My fault.
What you need, man?
Well, i'm throwing this formal dinner party and Bo don't know what to serve.
No problem.
Let me hook you up with my resident fun expert.
- Hey, yo, Heav.
- You rang?
Bo Jackson, Heavy D. - Yo.
- Yo, Bo.
Tell Heav your problem.
I'm throwing this formal dinner party.
And when it comes to cooking, Bo don't know diddley.
I think that's pronounced diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley.
Heav, show Bo around the kitchen.
No problem.
Follow me, your running backness.
Thanks so much for letting me be your close and personal friend.
Back at you, babe.
Hello.
Hey, Will, what's up man?
This is Malcolm.
Yo!
What up, home?
Listen, i'm going on this date tonight.
And I really want to impress this girl, and I was wondering if maybe I could tell her I know you?
Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm I mean, look, I understand your instinct but you shouldn't try to impress a girl with who you know.
It's much better that she like you just for yourself.
If she gets to know the Malcolm I know, I don't think she'll be able to resist.
Thanks a lot, Will.
Man, i don't know what I would do without you as a close, personal friend.
- Peace, man.
- Hey, peace, babe.
Master William, you have another visitor.
Come on, G, please.
I got to get my homework done.
Terribly sorry, sir, but he's otherwise engaged.
But I happen to be his close, personal friend.
Will, I got a serious problem.
Tonight I'm supposed to go in the studio and finish up this record.
I can't find the lead singer.
This is real important to me.
I need your help this time, man.
First of all, let's check our ego at the door.
- Q, I saved your butt before.
- I know.
That Thriller thing.
Q, as always, you need a singer, I'll get you a singer, man.
Yo, what's up, man?
This is Prince.
I got Quincy Jones over here.
Dude is in pain.
Could you come right over?
All right.
In a minute, babe.
- Who was that?
- Oh, a close, personal friend.
Mr. Al B. Sure.
- What's going on, man?
- Yo, what's up?
I'm glad you could come on such short notice.
- I need a big favor.
- Anything for you.
- Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
- AI B. Hey, Quincy Jones.
What's happening?
- Yo, y'all get to work on that track.
- Let's do it.
Will, 8:30, I've got to see A Different World.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, man.
I love that show.
Really?
- Hey, yo, K. - What?
What's happening, babe?
I want you to meet a couple of close, personal friends of mine.
Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
Kadeem Hardison.
Man, this dude knows everybody.
Yeah, that was a kind of slow night for me.
So come on, what's up?
- Come to the party with me.
- No, come to the party with me.
Guys, guys, listen, you have both made such good cases for yourself it makes it even harder to choose.
So, I'm going to have to go with basic raw, physical attraction.
What time should I be there, Carlton?
Welcome back to Croissants Aplenty.
I didn't order What kind of a croissant is that?
It's peanut butter.
And it's on the house.
Looks like it's been on the floor.
You look a little down.
Did you lose the contest to your friend?
Yeah.
Who'd have guessed it?
Especially in a place this well lit.
Strange things happen on Halloween.
Don't remind me.
I got to go to that party tonight on the solo tip.
Don't feel too bad.
There's bound to be at least one other guy there without a date.
Yeah.
You know, Cindy, you're probably right.
Master William, there were three phone messages for you.
From a Miss Karen, a Miss Judy, and a Miss Trisha.
What did they say?
"How desperate do you think I am"?
"Not on your life".
And, "Ha ha ha ha ha "ha".
So, why did the security guard stop you, Hilary?
It seems I fit the description of a shoplifter they've been trying to catch.
What was the description?
I don't know exactly, but it's fair to guess that "stunning" was part of it.
Eugene said he was sorry.
Who is Eugene?
The security guard.
Hilary invited him to the party.
Why did you do that?
It seemed to speed up the paperwork.
Before the party starts, I think I'll go up and get some rest.
Wait a minute.
Philip, you didn't get a costume.
You went to that silly gadget store.
I didn't buy a silly gadget.
I bought a stapler.
Only three pencils remain.
Proceed to stationery store immediately.
Everyone go get ready.
I'm going to put my costume on now.
What is it, Hilary?
A gorgeous Yves Saint Laurent dress.
Scary.
I just got off the phone with Melinda, my date.
She's coming as Mrs. Santa Claus.
I hope that doesn't conflict with what your date will be wearing.
For your information, I have a date.
What's her name?
Janet Girlie.
Geoffrey, isn't this a fabulous party?
The entire Brat Pack is here, plus two Twin Peakers.
Oh, Miss Ashley.
You look absolutely splendid in your costume.
I wanted to come as a ballerina but I guess a short guy with a mustache is the next best thing.
Carlton.
White face and lipstick.
Boy, you're living out all your fantasies tonight, huh?
So, sore loser, is your date here yet?
She'll be here.
Will, for your information, the skeleton over there is Elizabeth McGovern and the unicorn standing next to her is Kevin Bacon.
And they both wish you would stop hitting on them.
Why did you come as Elton John?
I'm supposed to be Superfly, Hilary.
Well, your super fly's open.
Trick or treat!
Can I take a look inside those bags, please?
What kind of outfit is that for a Halloween party?
I'm going as Comfortable Man.
Is that a comic-book hero?
Sort of.
He has superhuman bill-paying powers so he gets to dress however he likes.
Love that costume, Daddy.
Oh, no.
Well, Philip, do you know who I'm supposed to be?
I don't care.
You look fantastic.
What are you looking at, clown?
Oh, look.
There's Kiefer Sutherland talking to River Phoenix.
What happened to your date, Carlton?
Did she hit her head and her eyesight come back?
She's powdering her nose.
I can understand your bitterness, Will.
The party's almost over, and you lost the bet.
Ladies and gentlemen Cinderella.
Hello.
Is my prince here?
Hello, Will.
Do I know you?
Give a guy your last peanut-butter croissant he forgets you in a minute.
Cindy?
The waitress?
That's right.
Baby, that hairnet was doing nothing for you.
Will, can I be your date tonight?
Baby, forget tonight.
Let's block out the next 50 years.
Why did you decide to come?
Well, when the two of you showed up at the restaurant I thought you were just a couple of macho clods.
But when you came back, you were so sweet.
I guess I'm a sucker for a sad puppy.
This doesn't affect our bet, Will.
I still found a date first.
Stop it!
Let go of me, you creep!
Eugene, what are you doing?
I thought our agreement was you could come to my party but you couldn't falsely arrest anybody.
This isn't a false arrest.
This is the shoplifter I mistook you for.
This girl's a kleptomaniac.
- My silverware.
- That's my watch.
My date.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.
You don't have to break the law to have a happy Halloween.
Good night, now.
Will, may I have this dance?
Yeah, baby.
Your prince is in effect.
Where do you live?
I live with my stepmother and her two daughters in Encino.
So, do you work every night?
Yeah.
I have to stay at the cafe and wait for everyone to leave, and sweep up.
Where'd you get this fly costume at?
Well, I was sweeping up, and an old lady came in and she It's a long story.
Oh, no.
I didn't know it was so late.
I've got to go.
Cindy, wait!
I'm sorry, Will.
Her slipper.
Could it be?
I've been touched by magic.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I dropped my shoe.
Maybe I should try some of those insole thingies.
Listen, here's my number.
Call me tomorrow.
I can't believe Carlton went to sleep.
Why couldn't he help us clean up?
If you found out the only person in the world that would go out with you was mentally deranged, you'd go to bed early, too.
Trick or treat!
I'm sorry, we're out of candy.
How come you guys came so late?
We were watching Matlock.
I got something better than candy.
A scary story.
It was a cold, dreary, wintry night.
October 31 was the date.
There was a couple of little kids dressed just like you trick or treating in Bel-Air around 8:00.
Now, normally Bel-Air was safe and sound.
But this year, things were ill.
But, as on every Halloween, the parents sent their kids out not knowing this year it wasn't chill.
There was a rude awakening in this Bel-Air town no more tranquility or peace.
Not Jason, Michael Myers, or Freddie Krueger but this monster was called the Bel-Air Beast.
This monster was dreadfully ugly and he bothers you when you're all alone.
A face like nothing you've ever seen before and he reeks of Polo cologne.
He stalks his victims slowly, with the world's most terrible breath.
But he doesn't use an axe or a chain saw he talks his victims to death.
So if you see this monster run and don't look back, kids.
This monster's called the Bel-Air Beast and, oh, my goodness, there he is!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I told them you were awake.
Happy birthday, Geoffrey!
I'm so touched.
May I get you anything?
Don't be silly.
You're always worried about pleasing us, but today it's Saturday, we're home and we're waiting on you.
This is highly irregular.
I don't want to hear it.
Today, we're your butlers.
Here's breakfast in bed.
Is there anything else you would like?
A spot of tea.
I'll get the tea.
Would you like anything with that?
Geoffrey, relax.
It's your birthday.
We're gonna do all of your most hated chores.
But, sir, I don't hate any of my chores.
We do.
Are you going to do anything special for your birthday?
Most assuredly, Miss Ashley.
Tonight, I'll be enjoying a BBC broadcast of Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore followed by a penetrating interview by David Frost.
And they say the man can't party.
Before we get you your tea there's something else we'd like to do for you.
Carlton, put away that tired old kazoo, please.
Get busy for me one time, Skinny A. "Happy birthday, my man G "Because you know the most About butlery "So don't move an inch, stay where you sit "We're going to treat you like The King of Brit" Did you see that look on Geoffrey's face?
He just lit up.
I never thought I'd say this, but it feels really good to do something for somebody else for a change.
Aren't we supposed to make him some tea?
Right.
How'd you like to go into the kitchen and introduce Mr. Tea Bag and Mr. Teapot to Mr. Boiling Water?
Hilary, how'd you like to make the tea before I take away Mr. Allowance?
Mother, please.
Don't talk down to me.
Yo, I got it.
I know what I'm getting G for his birthday.
- What?
- Let me give you a hint.
Little Richard?
Shut up.
No.
I want to hook Geoffrey up with a woman so he can get busy.
I think Geoffrey's busy enough, what with all his chores.
You don't get it.
Look, it's Geoffrey's birthday, and he's just staying up listening to his radio.
Straight up, the man's depressed.
No, he's not depressed.
He's British.
It's the man's birthday.
Leave him alone.
If Geoffrey's interested I don't see any harm in introducing him to a nice woman.
- Here she goes.
- Here what goes?
Your poor Aunt Vivian seems to think she's a matchmaker.
In her mind, she's the Chuck Woolery of Bel-Air.
It's not just my opinion.
When I was in college, I introduced three couples and they all got married.
And by your fifth reunion, they were all divorced.
I just get them to the altar.
After that, they're on their own.
People, people, please.
I don't want to hear your dirty laundry.
Geoffrey deserves a woman interested in a serious, long-lasting relationship.
And I know exactly where to find her.
The mall.
Wait till Geoffrey sees this.
When I'm done, he won't have to polish this for a month.
- I can see myself.
- I can't.
Stay smooth.
Don't buckle.
Hilary, what's the problem?
I've never wrapped a present before.
Geoffrey's always wrapped my presents.
Hilary, you can't ask him to wrap his own present.
I guess that's another one of those unwritten rules.
Man!
Two hours at the mall, and I ain't get no girls.
What did you expect?
You went to the mall with girl-away there.
For your information, Hilary, Jazz here happens to be the master when it comes to cracking on the girls.
The boy is irresistible.
Sure, maybe during a blackout.
I'd love to get a hold of you during a blackout.
Daddy.
That's better.
Now, where were we?
In honor of Geoffrey's birthday, we are preparing an incredible feast.
Beef Stroganoff, Potatoes au Gratin, and Apple Brown Betty.
It sounds delicious.
When will it be ready?
In 55 seconds.
Just tell us when to zap it.
Could you put a hold on dinner, please?
I'm trying to find Geoffrey a girl.
The words "mission impossible" come to mind.
- I know someone.
- Really?
You know my friend Samantha?
Maybe I should explain some of the finer points of the law to you.
I was going to say that Samantha has this sweet nanny who just came from England.
She says Helen has nothing to do.
She just sits in her room at night knitting.
I smell a match.
How long has this nanny been in America?
Two weeks.
Perfect.
A lonely woman, new to our country she probably won't even notice what a Melvin Geoffrey is.
Yo, Geoffrey.
Ashley, you go invite her.
The rest of y'all beat it.
You bellowed, Master William?
I've been thinking about it.
I'm not down with you being lonely on your birthday.
I shall be far from lonely.
I shall be spending the evening with the glorious music of Sir William Schwenck Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan not to mention David Frost.
So far, I count you plus three guys.
I just thought you might prefer a woman.
I'm not making too big an assumption here, am I?
As it happens, I like women just fine.
But I think it's a bad idea for a butler to intertwine his private life with that of the family.
Surely you gleaned that much from watching Mr. Belvedere.
But, G, there's this nice old British nanny that Ashley knows she really wants to go out with you.
- Sorry, Master William.
- But Ashley already invited her.
What?
I told her that was a little pushy, but you know kids.
This is just regrettable.
It ain't so bad, G. I mean, it's your patriotic duty to show your countrywoman a good time.
G, don't do it for yourself.
Do it for the King.
I wouldn't want to disappoint King Elizabeth.
Helen is going to be here any minute.
- Baby, hook it up.
- I'm hooking as fast as I can.
Don't be such a wanker.
- What are you going to wear?
- Voila!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,no, no,no, no, no.
Come on, G. Hilary's taking you and Helen to the fliest club in LA.
Jazz is the DJ there.
He said the place is all of that.
All what?
Look, forget it.
I don't think you understand, man.
You got a kind of a Ben Vereen thing going here, man.
Come on, baby.
You got to dress a lot funkier than that.
Funkier?
There.
Pure, unadulterated funk.
All right, look, G, forget about looking cool.
Let's concentrate on acting cool.
Don't talk to me about cool.
During the '70s, I was briefly employed as Led Zeppelin's road butler.
When the music is pumping and it's time to go on the dance floor this is what you do.
Now you give it a try.
I would be most happy to, but to the best of my knowledge hell has not yet frozen over.
Madam, sir.
A round-trip ticket to England.
Thank you.
We thought it would be nice for you to see your family.
Yes, I suppose I should drop in on them.
This is from Ashley and me.
I paid the lion's share.
Happy birthday, Geoffrey.
English Leather.
English toffee.
An English muffin.
That sounds like my present, G, but I'll leave the unwrapping to you.
Will, must you be so ribald?
I won't answer that without a lawyer and a dictionary.
I'll get Helen.
Here's my present, Geoffrey.
Happy birthday.
I wrapped it myself.
Thank you, Miss Hilary.
This is most generous.
I know I boss you around too much.
This gift is my way of making up for it.
Hilary, sweetheart, you could also stop bossing him around.
Okay, then I'll keep the sweater.
- He's right this way, Helen.
- Happy birthday, G. Get ready to have your candles blown out.
Geoffrey, I'd like you to meet Samantha's nanny, Helen Carter.
Helen, I'd like you to meet Geoffrey.
- Charmed.
- It's nice to meet you.
From the children's description, I thought you'd be much older.
Ditto.
And this is my mom, my dad Hilary, Will, and Carlton.
You can call me Tony.
What are you trying to pull here, Tony the Tiger?
I didn't start it.
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Share the fantasy, Carlton.
I was just trying to be friendly.
Park your welcome wagon elsewhere.
That's Geoffrey's date.
She'll be dancing with him, but she'll be thinking of me.
So, Helen, I'm Will.
Welcome to our humble crib.
Ashley, this must be that houseboy you were telling me about.
That's homeboy.
Sorry.
I'm so glad you could make it tonight, Helen.
This is working out just beautifully.
The two of you look so wonderful together.
How many lives do you have to ruin, Vivian?
Helen, what part of England are you from?
Allow me, Miss Hilary.
You can tell a lot from a person's accent.
You're from London, of course.
- Of course.
- I'm guessing West End.
- Why, yes.
- Chilton Road?
- That's right.
- Upstairs above Shrimpton & Son.
Close.
One more block up, next to Bottomleys.
It has been a while.
Isn't this cute?
You two have so much in common.
You both speak English.
To this day, it remains the largest rhino ever to be taken with a bow and arrow.
Geoffrey, this is fascinating.
It's like going out with James Bond.
You're not the first to have made that comparison.
I'm going to go mingle.
The "A" list turned out tonight.
Really?
Look.
That's Tom Cruise's pool cleaner.
And that's Cher's electrolysist.
And that's Heather Locklear.
Hey, beautiful, I see you've come to make up.
What's with the Band-Aid?
Was your brain leaking?
I hit the pavement kind of hard when your dad threw me out of the house.
You could call it a love scar.
Perhaps I haven't been clear in the past.
I don't like talking to you.
I don't even like seeing you.
So please, just go away.
I love a flirt.
Will, what are you doing here?
Leave Geoffrey and Helen alone.
What do you think I am?
I'm down here merely to hang out with my good friend Jazz.
While you're here at it, hose him down.
I got to run.
There's Demi Moore's cable man.
- Yo, J, what up, baby?
- Yo.
Your cousin's really starting to warm up to me.
Yeah, right.
- What's wrong with you?
- Peep out that babe G's with.
You mean Wonder Woman?
Check this out.
I got the worst luck in the world.
All the babes I mess with in Bel-Air been whacked, right?
I follow you so far.
I go to hook G up with an old British nanny it turns out to be her.
She don't look too old to me.
I know, Jazz.
She's perfect.
Homey, I'm in love.
G didn't even want to go out with her in the first place.
I don't know what you guys do in Philly but in LA, we don't give stuff like that away.
I don't know what you guys do in LA but in Philly, you crack on somebody's honey, you get yourself killed.
I don't know what you guys do in Philly, but in LA, we men have to take that risk.
Yo, brother, you want to take this outside?
Calm down, man.
Listen.
Tell me, how's your butler dance?
Like he dresses.
Why?
I'll throw on some house music, he can't hang out on the dance floor.
You can pick up all the pieces.
We got a brother in the house tonight.
He's celebrating his birthday.
He's my main man Geoffrey.
Clear the dance floor, and let him and his lady get busy.
Helen, care to cut a rug?
Smashing.
Like an angel in flight.
Yeah, he is better than I thought he'd be.
They're doing the lambada.
That's the forbidden dance.
It's like this, right?
Mississippi Burning, right?
I'm getting that feeling of deja vu.
I'm trying to concentrate.
Could you turn that down?
I'm sorry, honey.
Maybe this will help.
It's Saturday night.
We always used to go out dancing Saturday nights.
Maybe we can do some in-house dancing.
- What are you doing home?
- Man, I sort of bounced home.
- They threw me out of the club.
- Why?
It all started when your man Geoffrey started doing the lambada.
Geoffrey does the lambada?
That's the forbidden dance.
You guys missed the night of the year.
Geoffrey is an amazing dancer.
He was doing back flips.
Back flips?
Isn't he cute?
- Good night, Geoffrey.
- Good night, Miss Hilary.
Yes, I think we'll go up, too.
Good night, everyone, and thanks for a lovely birthday.
- Yo, G?
- Yes?
Hold on.
I shouldn't have busted your groove at the club.
I guess what I want to say is it's all Jazz's fault, man.
Sit down, lad.
Master William for you, a birthday is a time to paint the town red but for me, it's a time of reflection.
A time to review one's successes and regrets.
One of my regrets has always been the fact that I never had a son.
I have so much advice to pass on to the next generation.
But no one to tell it to.
Look at the time.
Boy, I'm bushed.
Sit, William.
My boy, a man is much more than the job he holds or the clothes he wears.
For example, if I were to judge you by your costume I should guess you were some kind of circus performer.
That's pretty cold, G. But you made the same assumptions about me.
You assumed I was lonely.
You assumed I couldn't comport myself at a nightspot.
You assumed I was a poor dancer.
I hope the events of tonight have proved to you that I am, as the saying goes a fairly fly individual.
Helen sure thinks so.
She's certainly a hot little number.
But I'm afraid she and I were mismatched.
- She was a little too young for you?
- Quite the contrary.
I am afraid I was a little too intimidating for the poor girl.
She's looking for someone a little slower a little less sophisticated.
I could be slower.
I'm sure I could be less sophisticated.
She sensed that.
Here's her phone number.
She's expecting your call.
It isn't important that I got the date with Helen.
The important thing is I learned to appreciate Geoffrey as a human being.
And Geoffrey and I have a deeper relationship.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Good evening, sir.
How was your day?
Being a lawyer stinks, Geoffrey.
No matter how good a job you do your clients still compare you to Harry Hamlin.
Yes.
The resemblance is quite striking.
Come on, baby.
Get on the soul train.
I love this kind of dancing, it makes you feel so young.
Doesn't that golden oldie take you way back?
That was Papa's Got a Brand New Bag recorded 25 long years ago by James Brown the Granddaddy of Soul.
We'll be right back after this message from Geritol.
And the Fresh Prince drives down the court.
He stops, he pops, and it's Yes!
No.
Will, don't play inside.
You might break something.
Or something might break you.
I'm sorry.
You don't have a hoop outside.
And Jazz is getting tired of standing on the second-floor balcony holding a pool skimmer.
Come on, Prince, man.
I know a playground in my neighborhood.
'Course we can only play half-court.
They use the other end to sell stolen appliances.
Dope.
Let's go.
Hold on.
We don't want you playing there.
There's a perfectly good basketball court at the school, where Carlton is practicing.
Carlton's on the basketball team?
How do they do?
They try hard, but to tell you the truth, they haven't won a game so far.
Aunt Viv, don't you think if we went down to watch them practice Carlton would be a little embarrassed?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
All right.
Good try!
Man, these guys need help.
Help?
They need a telethon.
He threw that ball to me.
I'm on the other team.
I'm supposed to try and get it.
- You don't have to be rude about it.
- You two, make up right now.
All right, men.
Another brilliant warm-up.
Frankly, I think there's been way too much emphasis over the years on putting the ball actually through the hoop.
So let's practice some passing.
- Coach Smiley, may I have a minute?
- Sure.
All right, men, take five.
Headmaster Thorvald, good afternoon.
This is Barry O'Donnell.
He's a distinguished alumnus and I'm encouraging him to donate money for a new gymnasium.
Coach.
What do you think the team's prospects are this year?
For what?
For winning.
Excuse me.
What about those two?
You've been holding out on me.
Now those are players.
I'd like to meet them.
Gentlemen.
Not you.
You two, come on over.
I want you to meet somebody.
Mr. Thorvald, straight up, about that fire alarm: I don't know who pulled it.
Forget about it.
I'd like you to meet two of Bel-Air Academy's newest recruits.
This is Will Smith and Your name is Jazz, man.
Of course, Mr. Jazzman.
Will, where have you been hiding yourself?
What do you mean?
During gym class?
No.
I just wondered, how'd you two men like to join the school team?
Man, I ain't even in this school.
I'm willing to look past that if you are.
Coach, he can't be on the team if he's not in school here.
Okay.
How about you, Will?
I was just trying to find somewhere to play.
You join this team, you can play here anytime you want.
- No, I don't think so.
- It'll look good on a college application.
I don't know, Coach.
All right.
I'll give you my car.
Okay, this is gonna be fun.
The coach asked me to go through the playbook with you.
Your team doesn't need a playbook.
They need a prayer book.
Now, pay attention.
This is you and this is me.
Carlton, you got it wrong already.
It's more like this.
This is me.
And this is you.
Fair enough.
This is my brain and this is your brain.
This is my handsome face.
And this is your ugly little Frankenstein face.
- Give me that chalk.
- Come on, man, beat it.
- Give it.
- Ashley!
Here, Ashley, finally there's an adult in the room.
Guys, I'm trying to study.
What are you doing?
- Keep away from Carlton.
- Over here.
Children, please!
What if your parents witnessed this horseplay?
- Give me that chalk immediately.
- Keep it away from Carlton!
Keep away from Carlton and Geoffrey.
You've met your match, Master William.
Geoffrey, get off me, man.
Geoffrey?
May I get you something, sir?
No, thank you.
Will, how many times do I have to tell you that this is our living room?
How'd you like it if I went into your room and started throwing chalk around?
I'd be devastated.
Out.
- Why did you do that?
- What?
You singled Will out.
They were all goofing around.
He was the mastermind.
Trust me.
I just wish you'd be nicer to Will.
He joined the basketball team and you haven't said a word about it.
- Give him some credit.
- All right.
I see your point.
Besides, I think it's a great opportunity for you two to find some common ground.
After all, you were kind of a star athlete in college.
"Kind of a star athlete"?
All right.
You were a football god.
Okay.
Who knows, it might do him some good.
Nothing like a little organized sport to straighten a guy out.
Yes.
It did wonders for Pete Rose.
Hilary, I appreciate you coming tonight.
I know you're not a big sports fan.
Mother, please, it's Will's first game with the team.
I'm proud of him.
If I didn't show up to support him, what kind of cousin would I be?
lt'll be three hours well spent.
Three hours?
Five, four, three, two, one!
I'm going to Disneyland!
You did all right!
All right, men, good game on Friday.
But we can do even better this week.
- So let's go over some plays.
- Sorry I'm late, Coach!
Sorry isn't good enough, Cartwell.
- I was under the assumption - You made an assumption.
Don't make an assumption because you will be an ass and the ump will shun you.
Cartwell, after practice, you give me 10 laps around the school.
Yes, Coach.
Now let's take a look at this play.
What's up?
It's my squad.
Sorry I'm late, Coach.
Don't worry about it, Smith.
You just take it easy.
Save that energy for the game.
But I was late, and I have to run 10 laps.
Twenty laps.
Now, shut up.
First play.
Guard inbounds to the center.
Center moves down court, fakes right, passes to the forward.
What does he do?
- Passes to Will?
- Bingo.
Second play.
Jump ball.
Ball is tipped to the center.
Center shuttles to the guard, back to the center who hits to the forward and over to baseline.
- What does he do?
- Passes to Will.
Yes!
Okay.
Number three.
Forward inbounds from here bounce pass to the guard, who zips it back to the forward under the net.
What does he do?
If he's clear, he goes for the lay-up.
Otherwise, back to the guard.
Okay, Banks, not paying attention?
Ten laps.
Not paying attention?
Look at Will.
He's asleep.
Mind your own business, Banks.
That's 20 laps.
NBA superstar Isaiah Thomas is used to having things his own way.
But not today.
How do you do it, Prince?
Easy, Isaiah.
Air Fresh gym shoes.
Just pass it to Will.
Hi, pumpkin.
Hi, love.
- Hi.
- Is Will home yet?
He's outside playing basketball with Carlton.
Come on, Will.
Now let me down.
Will, would you come in here a minute, please?
What's going on?
I've been thinking about what you said about us finding some common ground.
- Good.
- The firm has season tickets for the Laker game, so I put in for them.
I thought we could go.
Philip, what a great idea.
He'll love it.
Thank you.
Uncle Phil, thanks for putting the hoop up on the garage.
It's really helping my lay-ups, Dad.
Come on out, I'll show you.
Sounds great, Carlton, but in a minute, okay?
- You wanted to talk to me?
- I have two tickets to the Lakers game.
- How'd you like to come?
- Word, I'm with that.
Give the Laker girls an opportunity to check out a future Laker.
Yeah, right.
Son, you want to show me those lay-ups?
Maybe a little bit later.
Actually, I've got some studying to do.
- After dinner?
- Okay.
- Uncle Phil, want to shoot a few hoops?
- Sure.
Did I tell you how my high-school team won the state championship?
I made the final basket right at the buzzer.
That's decent.
- Hi, Carlton.
- Hi, Hilary.
- Hilary, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
How was I in the basketball game last Friday?
You were great.
You didn't make any baskets or anything but you looked cute in your uniform.
I think it's great how you don't get it too sweaty.
I guess it's 'cause you don't run too fast.
Smart move.
Did Dad mention me during the game?
He did turn around to the guy behind him once and say: "Shut up.
That's my son you're talking about".
It's Will, isn't it?
No.
It's not.
Talk to me.
Look, it's ridiculous to compare yourself to Will.
You're captain of the debate team, a straight "A" student you're leader of the glee club.
So what if Will's good at basketball?
Thanks, Hilary.
That means a lot to me.
Besides, if that basket were two feet lower you'd be just as good as he is.
Geoffrey, I'm surprised you decided to come.
You're not a basketball fan.
True, madam, but I have found that any game can be made interesting if you put a little money on it.
- You bet on this game?
- $50 says Bel-Air wins it.
Who'd take that bet?
You rang, beautiful?
Jazz, you bet against Will?
Yeah.
He screws up, I'm loaded.
Students, parents, alumni, let me introduce our beloved coach Herb Smiley.
Thank you.
I see a lot of new faces out here tonight faces I didn't see when we were losing.
People who did not support this team in its darkest hour.
All I can say is, I don't blame you one bit.
Half the time, I didn't want to be there.
And quite frankly, I usually ducked out a little early.
But that's all gonna change tonight because of our new superstar Will Smith.
With seven seconds remaining, Bel-Air is down by two points and calls a time out.
Our only hope for winning this game is by shooting a three-pointer.
So here's the plan.
Cartwell, you inbound to Hunt.
- Hunt, what do you do?
- Shoot for the three-pointer?
Very funny.
That'll be 10 laps, chowderhead.
- What's the right answer?
- Pass it to Will.
All right.
Now, let's do it.
One, two, three, Bel-Air!
Oh, my God.
Yes!
Thirty, forty, fifty!
- There.
- Thanks, man.
Nice doing business with you.
Mr. Jazz, the World Snooker Championship is on the sports station in a few moments.
Would you care to place a wager?
- I don't know anything about snooker.
- Don't worry.
I'll tell you everything you need to know.
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
If you'd like to practice some new and more spectacular ways to lose a game, please join me.
- Put that down.
- Put what down?
- My basketball.
- Your basketball?
Excuse me, your name is Spalding?
Dad gave it to me for my birthday three years ago.
It's my ball.
Give it.
In a bad mood?
You should be the happiest guy in the world.
Yeah?
Why?
'Cause you got out of that locker room alive.
Man, Coach Smiley was upset.
Boy, you're lucky that was just a starter's pistol.
I was trying to win the game.
No, you were trying to be the hero.
Somebody else can be the hero besides you all the time.
Let's get something straight.
I been here for two months.
I been getting yelled at at home screamed at at school, I been sent to detention, grounded threatened with expulsion on almost a daily basis.
I finally do something I get credit for, and you can't take it.
Man, I got news for you.
I ain't about to sell myself short just to make you feel better.
Grow up!
You should grow up, hogging the ball every chance you get!
- I wasn't hogging nothing.
- You were!
Okay, you two.
What's this all about?
Carlton doesn't want me to use his basketball 'cause he's afraid I might get it in the basket.
Will you two start acting your age?
What I saw on that basketball court tonight was a disgrace.
If I'd made that last shot, I'd be the hero right now.
Carlton, the fact that you missed the shot wasn't a disgrace.
You stole the ball from a member of your own team.
Yeah, and if you'd passed it to me, we would've won.
You would?
Of course, I can make that shot with my eyes closed - and one hand tied behind my back.
- Was that gonna be your next trick?
'Cause you were like a one-man circus out there.
Uncle Phil, the coach told the team to pass the ball to me.
Did he tell you to woof at the crowd kiss the cheerleader between plays, and shoot the ball backwards?
No, I came up with all that fly stuff myself.
That wasn't fly, Will.
A real star plays with the team.
Maybe you should think about that.
Carlton, can I ask you something?
Sure.
When you stole the ball from Will and tried to make that Hail Mary shot what were you thinking about?
- I don't know.
- Really?
I guess I was just thinking of the first game Will won and how you ran out on the court and you were so proud of him.
I guess I thought it would be cool if it happened to me.
Carlton, you don't have to be a hero.
I'm proud that you're out there giving it all you got.
You started coming to games when Will joined the team.
- I wanted to support him.
- You wouldn't come when it was just me.
I'd like to come to everything you do.
I always come to your tennis games, to your debate matches your glee club concerts.
Frankly, keeping up with your extracurricular activities is a 24-hour-a-day job.
Did I mention I was elected editor of the yearbook?
I didn't mean to slight you.
But I can't slight Will, either.
His mother is 3,000 miles away.
He needs a cheering section as much as you do.
Maybe more.
- I'm gonna head up.
Good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.
Will.
Yeah?
Here.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
"And so the men and women of Plymouth Colony "sat at a long table with their new-found Indian friends "to celebrate the first Thanksgiving.
"And at the head of the table, the leader of the pilgrims "folded his hands, bowed his head and said" And then the village idiot interrupted the prayer ruining the feast for one and all.
Boy, holiday traffic is starting already.
People are in such a lousy mood.
I learned five new words on the way home.
- Did you know what they meant?
- I think so.
They were accompanied by very helpful hand gestures.
Will, I bet you can't wait till your mom gets here.
Yeah.
Thanks for flying her out, Aunt Viv.
We had to convince her to accept it.
She never lets us spend a penny on her.
Apparently, that's not a genetic trait.
Now, for Thanksgiving do you want to try something different or the traditional turkey?
Mother, I have a big problem with turkey.
What's wrong with it?
From the moment they're hatched to the moment they're shrink-wrapped turkeys are raised to be food, and nothing but food.
Hilary, I don't think too many of them had aspirations to be doctors or lawyers.
My sister should be here any minute.
Aren't you excited?
Yeah, I can't wait till she gets out here and starts taking her usual shots at me.
Vi's that way with everybody.
Remember what she said about my beard?
You misunderstood.
She said it made me look like Bigfoot.
Which is ridiculous, because nobody knows what Bigfoot really looks like.
That's her.
Come on.
- Mom!
- Baby!
Goodness gracious!
Viv, come on, give us a hug!
Look at my boy.
You really have changed.
Yeah, I'm handsome.
No, you haven't changed.
I hope he's not eating you out of house and home?
Not at all.
He's certainly not taking any food out of your mouth.
Starting already.
I don't believe it.
That's a good one, Mama.
I got to use that one.
No, you don't make fun of your uncle.
That's my job.
Come on, let's go inside.
- Girl, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.
How's everything at the post office?
- They made me a supervisor.
- That's wonderful.
Honey, they make everybody at the post office a supervisor.
You practically have to eat the mail not to get promoted.
- Aunt Vi.
- My goodness, aren't you handsome?
And looking less and less like your daddy every day.
Ouch.
Run for cover, Dad.
Where's he going to hide at?
Vi, this is Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, my sister-in-law, Mrs. Smith.
- How do you do?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Mom, check this.
Geoffrey, take my mom's bags to her room.
What did I do?
You can take those bags yourself.
That man is twice your age.
Even though he doesn't look it.
At least take the heavy one.
Now go on.
- But, Mom - You heard me.
After you, Master William.
Carlton, go tell your sisters their aunt is here.
Y'all tell me, has Will been giving you any trouble?
He's been wonderful, hasn't he, Philip?
Let's just say he takes after you, Vi.
Okay.
Vi, I was dusting the albums this morning and guess what I found.
Certainly not dust.
The Temptations!
Girl, I have that album.
You had it.
I borrowed it.
You taught me to dance to this, remember?
I didn't teach you to dance like that.
- Move over, girlfriend.
- Look out.
- Aunt Vi!
- My girls!
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Dance with us.
Here we go.
All right.
Here you go.
That's right.
What dance is this?
It's called the swim, Ashley.
It was very popular in the 1940s.
The 1960s, and it's not the swim.
Your daddy knows how to swim.
Come on.
Swim for her.
Come on, Philip.
Everybody out of the pool.
That cobbler was delicious.
The person that invented the elastic waistband should get the Nobel Prize.
- You know what I mean - Don't start.
Mom, you know who used to make the best cobbler?
Old lady lvory down the street.
- Does she still make it?
- Honey, she passed on.
- You're kidding.
- Child, she was in her early 100s.
You'd have never known by the way she used to swing that baseball bat at me.
Can we have a moment of silence?
Yeah, well.
Mom, Dad, I have a little favor.
My English teacher doesn't have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving tomorrow and I just thought, since he's all alone, and we have so much to share could we invite him to dinner?
Certainly, Carlton.
That's very thoughtful.
And not the worst way to pull my grade up to an "A".
This sure was lovely.
- No, Mom, I'll get that for you.
- Thank you, babe.
Geoffrey!
Mom, what did I do?
It's all right, Viola, Geoffrey clears the table.
It's his job.
You shouted, Master William?
Yes, Geoffrey.
Why don't you have a seat and have some of this delicious peach cobbler - while we clear the table.
- Don't go through so much trouble.
No trouble at all.
Hilary, Carlton, Ashley, and you Your Highness, let us all clear the table.
That's a good one.
Honey, do I look like I'm telling a joke?
Not to me.
Don't just sit there watching.
Pick up the dishes and get them into the kitchen.
Now hustle.
Some guest.
What should I do with these bowls?
Just put them in the dishwasher.
Here?
Let's just take them up to Geoffrey's room.
He'll know what to do with them.
Lord, have mercy.
Just leave them here.
I'll take care of them.
Now, go on.
Honestly, I've never seen such a lazy bunch in my life and I work at the post office.
- Yo, Jesse!
- How's it going, Will?
Mom, this is my man Jesse.
He does the gardening here.
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
Is your aunt around?
I want to know where to plant the bushes.
I think she said she wanted them by the pool.
Could you do me a favor?
My mom really likes roses.
Can you snip a couple for her bedroom?
- No problem.
- Wait a second.
Honey, don't go bossing him around.
If you want to cut me some flowers, you go get them yourself.
- But, Mom - Understand?
Okay, I'll cut you the most beautiful bouquet in the world but its beauty will pale in comparison to yours.
Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.
Jesse, listen, it's the day before Thanksgiving.
Take the day off.
Thanks.
You going to be around here for Christmas?
Jesse!
Good, I wanted to talk to you about the bushes.
We can talk about it next week.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.
Is Jesse leaving?
He didn't mow the lawn.
Mom gave him the day off.
What?
It's a holiday.
It'll be cool if the grass grows for another week.
No.
It's not growing 'cause you going to cut it.
Why me?
You always mowed the lawn back home.
I don't see why can't you do this one.
'Cause it's the size of a football field!
Since when do I have to ask you twice?
- But, Mom - Now hustle.
Okay, but I ain't going to cut you no flowers.
You should have talked to me before letting the gardener take the day off.
It's the day before Thanksgiving.
It was a nice idea, but it's the same thing with telling Geoffrey not to clear the table.
I just think that they might feel uncomfortable taking orders from somebody they don't know.
And they'd rather take orders from a 17-year-old boy?
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't mean to be critical but I don't like what I saw today.
Will's got a bunch of grown men doing all the work he should be doing.
I haven't seen him lift a finger except to scratch his head.
You're not being fair, Vi.
Will works very hard at his homework.
Back home, Will did his homework, mowed the lawn, raked the leaves and cleared the table.
I don't think a little work around the house is gonna interfere with his education.
From what I see, all he's learning is how to be a rich kid.
Philip and I just want Will to have the same advantages that our kids have.
Isn't that why you sent him out here?
I sent him out here to stay out of trouble and get a good education.
But, Vivian, I also taught that boy the value of hard work and I don't want him to lose that.
All I know is the kids in this house are getting a free ride a free ride in a fancy car.
But I don't mean to be critical.
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No.
All done.
Vivian, since Carlton's invited his teacher maybe you should call the caterers and tell them there'll be one more for dinner.
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fine.
Do you know what my sister just said?
You are not gonna believe this.
- She said that our kids are spoiled.
- News flash.
You mean you agree with her?
I keep saying they should do more work around the house.
- You're the one who's too easy on them.
- Really?
Does this sound familiar?
"Daddy, I need $300".
You don't have to get personal.
Vi just made an honest criticism.
Let's just leave it at that.
You really think I've been too easy on them.
Honey, we're not going to solve this overnight.
Look, let's just have a pleasant Thanksgiving tomorrow and we can talk about it after Vi leaves, okay?
Don't forget to call the caterer.
Hello, Sally?
This is Vivian Banks.
You had us scheduled for a Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.
We'd like to cancel it.
We're going to have the kids make dinner.
What do you mean, good luck?
Will, Carlton, Hilary, Ashley!
Get down here!
Hustle!
- Did you get the turkey?
- Certainly, madam.
Geoffrey, it's frozen solid.
Really, madam?
I thought it was just scared.
Mommy, didn't we just have a fire drill last week?
- This is not a drill.
- It's a fire?
My God, I'm going back for my new suede boots.
Don't try to stop me.
While you're up there, get my lucky drawers!
You are going to cook and serve Thanksgiving dinner.
- How?
- Why?
Because you kids don't do enough work around the house.
Excuse me?
Didn't I just mow Central Park yesterday?
Mom, my English teacher is coming to dinner.
He holds my English grade in the palm of his hand.
This is not the time for one of your leftist experiments.
Carlton's right, Mom.
This stuff about us working could really wait.
It has a real New Year's resolution feel to it.
I do not want to discuss this.
- Since when do I have to ask you twice?
- Every time, Mommy.
Well, not this time.
You've got 15 minutes to get up, get dressed, and get back down here.
Move it!
Instead of doing all this work, shouldn't I be spending some time with my mom?
I mean, she sees me so little and I'm growing so fast.
Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.
Your mother did not send you out here on vacation.
And so far, you've been getting a free ride, a free ride in a fancy car.
And if you really want to do something nice for your mother why don't you show her you can do some work here?
- But, Aunt Viv - No discussion.
Do you realize there's a bump forming back there?
All right, these are your assignments.
I'll do the turkey.
Ashley, you do the cranberry sauce.
Carlton, you do the stuffing.
Hilary, you do the yams and the rolls.
I get two things?
Why don't you just put a yoke around my neck and hitch me to a plow?
Hilary, I don't think it would be the worst thing in the world if you guys did some work around here.
I mean, you guys are getting a fancy ride, a fancy ride in a free car.
I'm sorry dinner's so late, Mr. Fellows.
That's okay.
I think in our society, we're too obsessed with time.
Save time.
Don't waste time.
Be on time.
What are we in such a hurry to do?
To eat.
Mr. Fellows, Carlton always talks about your English class.
- He said you were studying Shakespeare.
- This is really exciting.
We're reading Hamlet.
But to make it more relevant to the kids I'm teaching it to them in a rap version I wrote myself.
Oh, Lord.
Peep this.
"To be in effect "or not to be in effect?
"Slamming, man, on the questioning tip".
Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner will be served in 10 minutes.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
It seems that little Mr. Poppin' Fresh doesn't want to come out of his tube.
Perhaps this will persuade him.
Ashley, how's the cranberry sauce coming?
- All done.
- Darn it!
- Nice going, Carlton!
- Do you want to try to make this?
This stuffing is completely dry.
Look, do I have to do everything myself?
Carlton, this isn't exactly brain surgery.
When something is too dry, what do we do?
Cream of mushroom soup.
Pour.
Mix.
Can you do that?
- Hilary, did you check the yams?
- For what?
Oh, my God.
Shall we say grace?
Dear Lord, for this food we are about to receive make us truly thankful.
Amen.
Let's start by serving our guest of honor.
- Mr. Fellows, care for some yams?
- I'd love some.
Interesting.
I've never had them before with this thick black crust.
It's Cajun style.
Hilary burned them.
They're just burned on top.
Once you get underneath it they're totally charred.
How did you do that?
Mom, give Hilary a break.
I think she deserves some credit for putting out the fire.
Fire?
What else do we have?
That looks like cranberry sauce, Mr. Fellows.
- Lay it on me.
- Allow me.
- It looks wonderful.
Who made it?
- I did, Mommy.
It's delicious.
Yeah, you'd never know Ashley dropped it on the floor.
What about the stuffing?
Where's that been?
That's dope.
Give it a try, Mr. Fellows.
Yeah.
Sure.
I made it, Mr. Fellows.
I'm sure you'll find it of grade "A" quality.
- Speaking of A's - Yes?
Will is gonna get an "A" in my English class.
Congratulations, baby.
Do you have any news for my parents?
Not really.
So, how about that stuffing?
Serve yourself.
It looks Looks great.
Shall I pass it on?
No!
You can have all of that.
That's a good idea.
Save lots of room.
Because we have a turkey roasted to perfection by yours truly.
- Would you do the honors, Uncle Phil?
- Why, certainly.
It's frozen inside.
I'm sorry.
I thawed it as much I could.
What am I supposed to do, sit on it all day?
Come on, Vi.
The kids worked very hard on this.
Honey, "hard" is the word.
Let's see what food we can throw together.
I know, 'cause Bigfoot is growling.
Honestly, that dinner was a disaster!
That's not true.
Mr. Fellows is out there drinking his second cup of stuffing.
This is certainly one for the books.
You know, Vi, you really hurt my feelings yesterday.
What are you talking about?
When you said I was spoiling Will and my kids.
I'm just trying to give them the things that we didn't have.
First of all, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Seems to me, when we were growing up I'd say a lot worse to you and you'd take it.
I don't know, I think living in California has made you sensitive.
I don't think I'm being sensitive, Vi.
You basically called me a bad mother.
Baby, look I don't think you're a bad mother.
I never would've sent Will out here if I thought you were.
I don't blame you for wanting to give those kids everything we didn't have.
But you got to teach them how to work hard, too.
That's what I taught you.
You turned out pretty good.
I got to admit it, Vi, Philip says I'm too easy on them.
I guess they should have some more responsibilities.
It wouldn't kill them.
Food!
I wouldn't be taking my time in here.
- I'm on my way.
- Here you go.
Ma, can I help you in here?
No, not from what I saw today.
Please.
You got to learn how to cook before you go to college.
Yeah, Aunt Viv can teach me.
She's a great cook.
She should be.
I taught her.
And your mama didn't raise no fools.
So, you got an "A" in English?
Yeah.
They think I'm a genius.
You just keep working hard, genius.
When I leave here I want you to listen to your Aunt Viv, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
I have to say you guys did a terrible job with dinner tonight.
I wish I could've seen you cooking it.
Mom, you definitely would've been crying, straight up.
You make me laugh just thinking about it.
But you always did make me laugh.
I miss that.
I miss it, too.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Yo, G, that was hilarious.
Put a Barney Rubble head on, I'd swear i was watching Flintstones On Ice.
I'm pleased that I've amused you, Master William.
It is the least I can do, given the hours of merriment I have derived from looking at the remarkable way your ears protrude from your head.
Butler With an Attitude.
So anyway, Toni's coming over.
We're gonna study for our history midterm together.
- She really needs help.
- She's not doing well?
Daddy, Toni is a dear friend of mine, but she lacks concentration.
She totally gave up on Twin Peaks.
Wow, Uncle Phil!
Did you lose a couple of pounds?
Man, you're looking chiseled.
So what do you want the car for, Will?
Public Enemy concert.
Jazz got two tickets.
Every time Jazz is in that car he leaves a small collection of chicken bones behind.
Don't worry.
Tonight, we're having ribs.
Daddy, I wanted to use the car tonight.
I'm going to a world peace benefit hosted by Steven Seagal.
Didn't you just hear me ask first?
I guess you're right.
Besides, I'd feel better knowing you had the car.
Especially if you're gonna be out again until 3:00 in the morning.
That's what time he got in last night.
Oops, did I say that?
No, it was for school, Uncle Phil.
I'm doing a term paper on owls.
Will, you've broken curfew entirely too many times.
- You are grounded for a week.
- A whole week?
Will, being grounded won't be all bad.
Maybe you'll find enough time to do your own dishes instead of paying Ashley.
Oops again!
Two weeks.
- I'm grounded for two weeks?
- That's right.
You're to stay in this house, and you're not to go anywhere near that car.
Can he still rent the car to Jazz?
Oops, oops, oops!
Let's make it an even month.
I don't know my own strength.
Revenge!
Miss Toni.
- Hi, Toni.
- Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I saw a lady wearing a sweater so ugly I was forced to pull over and yell at her.
Hi, Toni.
What are you two up to?
The library.
Big history exam.
How did your English midterm go?
- I think I did great, Mom.
- I think I failed it.
Will you cut it out?
You always say you've failed and then you get the test back and you always get a "D".
You're right.
I probably did fine.
Okay.
You two have fun at the library.
Bye.
A library?
I thought we were going shopping.
We are.
I was just saying that to her.
Come on.
What's this I hear, Hilary?
Lying to mommy?
I feel that revenge is within my reach.
This is a job for Sherlock Homeboy.
to keep up with Volvo.
Here at Toni's dorm room to determine where suspects went shopping.
Let's see what happens.
Hi, is this Toni Gower's room?
- We're her roommates.
- I'm Kimmy.
- I'm Cindy.
- I'm Will.
- Hi, Willie.
- Hi, Willie.
No, just "Will".
Can I get you something, Will?
No, thank you.
I'm trying to find Hilary Banks.
There's been a family emergency.
Sorry, we don't know her.
Yes, we do.
You know, Toni's friend.
- The one who never wears anything twice.
- Yeah.
Earth to Kimmy.
I just haven't seen her around since she dropped out of school.
Yeah, the midterms must have been a little too much for her.
Midterms?
Hilary dropped out three months ago.
This family emergency, is it, like, a big one?
It's even bigger than I thought.
Looks like I am gonna be pulling another all-nighter.
I have to get my index cards together for the big debate match next week.
What's your topic?
"When President Bush said he would never raise taxes "was he lying or just kidding"?
Sorry I'm late.
Time flies when you're studying.
Ain't that the truth, Ruth.
How was your day, honey?
It was great.
I got a lot of work done on my physics research paper.
What?
I was just thinking about that funny thing that happened to you today.
What are you talking about?
How soon they forget.
I'll explain.
Today after school was out, I went to UCLA and sat in the back of Hilary's physics class.
You did?
You remember.
After all, you were in the class.
That's right.
You did.
You remember that funny thing that happened.
Yeah, that funny thing.
Tell them about it.
Will sat in the back of my physics class.
While he was there Will, you tell it so much better.
See, I snuck up behind Hilary, right?
Her head must have been full with all that studying or something because when she saw me she said my head looked like the basic element of physics.
What was that technical term again?
A quark, right?
Right.
Exactly.
I said his head looked like a quark.
- Or was it a neutron?
- Right.
No, it was definitely a quark.
Of course.
I don't know what I must have been thinking.
That was a real scream, Will.
Dinner is served.
What do you know?
First of all, I know that the basic element of physics is matter.
If you were going to do a research paper you'd probably have to know something they taught on the first day.
- How did you find out?
- I have my methods.
It helps that Toni's roommates have the combined IQ of a raisin.
Listen to me, Will.
You can't tell mom and dad.
Excuse me?
You're not in any position to tell me what I can or cannot do, Miss Thing.
I'll do anything you want.
Just name it.
Thanks to you, I'm grounded for the next month.
All I want from you is that you make that month as pleasant as possible.
It's that simple.
At the risk of sounding redundant, dinner is served.
We'll be right there, Geoffrey.
- Hilary?
- What?
Carry me.
Yes?
"Yes," what?
Yes, Your Highness?
- Have you done His Highness' laundry?
- Yes.
Yes, Your Highness.
You forgot His Highness' overalls, his T-shirt, and of course, his pair of lucky drawers.
You're going to want to hand wash these.
- I am not hand washing your drawers.
- Yes, you are.
And from now on, you will pronounce the word "draws".
Okay, fine.
And His Highness would like to discuss the condition of his royal sneakers.
You will clean them with your toothbrush.
Not side to side, though.
Not up and down.
But a smooth circular motion.
Do you want me to floss them, too?
We are not amused.
And for this act of treason His Highness would like you to read him a bedtime story.
This is getting really annoying, Will.
Okey dokey, have it your way.
Uncle Phil!
Aunt Viv!
Okay, I'll do it!
His Highness would like you to read this Spider-Man comic book.
All right.
Let's make this fast.
"Spider-Man.
By Stan Lee".
The yellow box says: "High above Manhattan".
And Spider-Man goes, "My spider-sense is buzzing like a beehive".
His Highness would like you to describe everything in the picture.
- Can't you just look at it?
- Uncle Phil!
I was just asking.
He's sitting on the edge of some stupid building and there are wavy lines coming out of his head so he's hot, or his head smells or something.
Anyway Hilary.
That's his spidey-sense.
Okay.
There's also something gross coming out of his wrist.
Is this the guy you don't want to be standing next to at a party, or what?
Anyway, this fat guy in a really bad suit grabs him and goes: "Spider-Man, at last we meet again".
That's Doctor Octopus, but his voice is a lot deeper than that.
Give it a try.
"At last, we meet again".
And it's raspier.
"At last, we meet again".
Come on, baby.
You doggin' it.
"At last, we meet again"!
Happy?
You have amused us, but His Highness is tired and would like to go to sleep.
Thank God.
But first, His Highness would like to be tucked in.
- You're kidding.
- Of course, I'm kidding.
Uncle Phil!
Nice and tight!
Not too tight.
I wouldn't want you to suffocate.
Before you go, we would like you to have this.
A list of things to do tomorrow night at the dinner table.
Like what?
Please, we do not wish them read in our presence.
Be gone!
Carlton, I'm living a nightmare.
Hilary, I'd love to talk to you but I'm staring down the barrel of an all-nighter.
Please, Carlton, I need help!
I'm coming to you because I know how much you don't like Will.
Will Smith is a fine young man.
Come off it, Carlton.
You're talking to me now.
We've let Will wreak havoc in our lives for too long.
And now it's time to band against him as brother and sister.
What have you got in mind?
That's what I need you for.
I don't have any plans, I just want to punish him.
I'm very vindictive, I'm just not imaginative.
Whether or not I want to punish Will and for the record, I haven't come out pro or con why are you so mad at him?
It's a long story, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.
Sure.
First of all, I dropped out of college.
- I know!
- Mom and Dad are gonna kill you.
I know, but the worst thing is Will found out.
Now he's using it to make me do all kinds of humiliating things.
Like what?
He's making me clean his sneakers.
- Really?
- It gets worse.
I have to hand wash his lucky "draws".
- Disgusting.
- And this is his latest: He gave me a list of embarrassing things I have to do at dinner tomorrow night.
That's awful.
- Is he making you clean his room?
- No.
Will you clean mine?
I'm sorry, but this is too good to be true.
Why should Will have all the fun?
- Why, you little - Dad?
I hate you!
Be that as it may I want these debate cards typed by tomorrow morning.
Double-spaced.
Today was Career Day and Teresa's dad came in to speak to us.
Really?
What does he do?
Joan Rivers.
He's a plastic surgeon.
Dinner is served.
What?
Did you memorize that list of things I gave you to do at dinner tonight?
Yes.
Just to be on the safe side, let's have a little pop quiz.
Number one: Any time Uncle Phil takes a drink, what do you do?
- I compliment you.
- Yes!
Did you memorize the list of compliments?
- Yes.
- Okay, very good.
Number two: Any time anyone says "Hilary," what do you do?
I bark like a dog.
That's right!
See you at dinner.
Will, if you have an ounce of compassion, you'll let me off the hook.
Yeah, that's a good point.
No, we'll do it anyway.
It's dinner time.
Did you memorize our list?
- Yes.
- Let's just review.
What do you do when I hit my glass with my spoon?
I insult Will.
Good.
And what do you do when I clear my throat?
I smack Will upside the head.
Damn it, you're prepared!
Let's go!
For these gifts we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
Amen.
Vivian, how were your classes today?
Fine.
I just wish my students would concentrate more on their work.
They're very easily distracted.
I see it every day.
Don't you, Hilary?
- Did you say something, sweetie?
- No.
Will Smith is perfect.
Why, thank you.
It's so nice to be appreciated.
Yes, but perhaps another time.
Your mother would appreciate it if she weren't interrupted again.
Sorry.
Anyway, as I was saying Will Smith is the king of the universe.
Why, thank you.
I'd like to finish my story, if that's okay with you, Hilary.
Hilary?
Look, I know everyone gets a little silly around midterms but not at the dinner table.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Will Smith is the scum of the earth.
Hilary!
However, Will Smith is the pinnacle of manliness.
Hilary!
What's with Hilary?
Stop it!
I can't take it anymore!
I dropped out of school!
There!
You did what?
- I dropped out of school.
- You dropped out of school?
- When did this happen?
- Three months ago.
- Three months ago?
- And you've been lying to us since then?
- Three months ago?
- Let me explain.
- Three months ago?
- Mother, please just let me explain.
I'm not interested.
You've been lying to us.
- And if you think for one minute - Philip, wait.
Will, Carlton, Ashley, take your dinner into the kitchen.
Thanks a lot, Will.
Man, they've been in there for an hour.
I wonder what Hilary told Mom and Dad about our part in all this.
I think it's pretty safe to assume she sang like a canary.
There's no need to worry.
She's been lying to them for three months.
We can punch holes in her credibility.
Mom, Dad, awfully sad about what happened to Hilary.
Hope her crazy lies don't drag down anyone else.
Carlton, sit.
Maybe we haven't been clear enough about the rules of this house.
You are not to blackmail other members of this family.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
You two are grounded for a month.
Will, added to the month you already have that should pretty much take you into fiscal '91.
- Dad!
- You are excused.
I don't know, Philip.
I've been thinking.
- About what?
- You know, what Hilary said to us.
That I put too much pressure on her.
That it's hard living up to a mother who's a college professor.
That I made her feel that she could never come to us and admit she failed.
You mean you bought that crap?
Mom, Dad, can I say something?
Yes.
I've been thinking.
And I decided that I'll do whatever you want me to do to make things better.
And exactly what would that be?
I don't know.
Whatever you want me to do.
Hilary, that's the problem.
We've been making all the decisions for you.
You're 21 years old.
It's time for you to make your own decisions.
If you weren't getting anything out of college and wanted to drop out you should have told us and not tried to hide it like a kid.
But I thought you wanted me to go to college.
We want you to go to college when you'll appreciate it.
It's not to make us happy.
It's to make something of your life.
We just want you to be all you can be.
You want me to join the Army?
Let's try this again.
Hilary, what do you want to do with your life?
I don't know.
I guess I'll have to think about it.
While you're thinking about it, you're going to get yourself a job.
Okay.
Good night.
Mom, Dad?
What kind of job do you want me to get?
I'm not talking to you.
Look, straight up.
I didn't know you'd break down like that.
You walk around here like nothing bothers you.
And I guess I took it a little too far, and I just wanna say I'm sorry.
Yeah, now.
An hour ago you were ready to tell on me.
You tripping!
I was never going to tell on you.
- Really?
- Come on, of course not.
How about you, Carlton?
We're dealing in hypotheticals here.
Fine.
I wasn't going to tell.
Does that little placebo make either of you feel any better?
So, I guess you're gonna hate me forever, right?
I thought about it.
I guess I brought this whole thing on myself.
If I hadn't gotten you grounded, you wouldn't have blackmailed me.
So, I've learned my lesson.
And we're even.
That's decent, Hilary.
Good night.
Before you go as my last official act of servitude, I did finish your laundry.
I can't believe I made you do that.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
What's done is done.
My lucky "draws"!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I wish I could see your sister's face when she finds Courtney's frog in her bed.
You and me both.
This is gonna be good.
If she doesn't scream soon, I'm gonna have to give my frog a drink.
Ferdinand gets dehydrated.
It's Will and Hilary.
Open up.
No.
We're all gonna die.
We wanted to say good night.
We're going to bed just as soon as we finish this frog-leg soup.
Frog-leg soup?
- It's mm-mm good.
- I wish you could have some but there wasn't enough frog to make more than two bowls.
- Can I have a bite?
- Sasha, they're eating Ferdinand.
Ferdinand?
This is a guy frog?
Nighty-night.
Don't let the snails bite.
Snails?
That's funny, I thought she said she put snakes in your sleeping bags.
Psych!
- That means "just kidding".
- Nighty-night.
Will?
Will you tell us a scary story before you go, please?
Okay, but I hope everybody's ready to be scared to death.
Yes!
Wait.
Hold up.
Scream for me one time.
That's good.
I got a scary story, but I have to warn you it's really, truly frightening.
- Any of you have pacemakers on?
- No.
See, what makes this story so scary is that it's true.
It happened to a guy named Will bert.
Wilbert Smith sonian.
See, Wilbert Smithsonian grew up in Philly.
He went to school in the 'hood, right?
But this school he went to was so tough I mean, it was graffiti everywhere, even on the principal.
But that's not the scary part.
It all happened right here in Bel-Air when Wilbert was transferred to a private school.
It was a living nightmare.
Enter as boys, leave as men?
!
?
!
How long they trying to keep us here?
Banker, what do you know?
- It's who you know that counts.
- Carlton, how you doing?
- Wallace.
- Chadster!
- Bankster!
- I'd like you to meet my cousin Willster!
So, Studmaster General, what's the word on co-ed tennis camp?
I really got a lot out of it, amigo.
Scored big on and off the court.
Way to play.
I kid you not, Will, women faint at this man's feet.
Odor-Eaters work for me.
Outrageous.
This guy's seriously twisted.
He gets in a good one now and then.
Will, this is Simon Stanhope, our student council president.
It's my job here to give you the tour.
I took the Universal Tour.
You know that earthquake ride?
Look out!
Here comes the subway car!
Excuse my cousin.
He just doesn't know.
As I was saying, this is our founder and those are the first students of the Bel-Air Academy and they all carved their names on this the alumni desk.
And these are the championship oars that we retired in 1957.
Y'all don't throw nothing away.
I'm Edward Fellows III, but call me Ned, okay?
Okay.
You've been assigned to my lit class, so I read your records.
I just wanted to say, we're both coming from the same place.
You're from Philly?
Shaker Heights, Ohio.
But when I was doing research on my main man Langston Hughes, I lived in Harlem.
And believe me, those two weeks changed my life.
"I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young "I built my hut by the Congo and it lulled me to sleep "My soul has grown deep like the waters" I can tell.
Listen, I've got a mean collection of jazz platters.
Anytime you feel like grooving, come over and get down with my bad self.
Seriously, you have any problems, any questions?
Where are all the fly honeys at?
- Fly honeys?
- Yeah, girls.
Will, didn't anybody tell you this is an all-boys school?
Greetings Bel-Airdales.
We're the Alligaroos.
And we'd like to take this opportunity to tell you new students to Then Wilbert saw their evil plan.
They were trying to break him down.
First, they told him it was an all-boys school.
Then they tortured him with a half an hour of Broadway show tunes.
But he wouldn't break.
Then they went ballistic.
They brought in the evil teacher, Dr. Bloat.
Enter the Bloat.
Five, four, three, two I am Dr B, period, Langford Oates.
And you are Alan, Banks, Downer, Fales, Hunt, Lieberbaum, Smith William Smith.
Stanhope, Sterling, Svenson Yo!
- Mr. Svenson?
- Ja?
Mr. Smith, how good of you to join us.
Mr. Smith, look around.
Do you see any difference between yourself and the other young gentlemen?
Is that like a trick question?
The tie, Mr. Smith.
The tie.
Kindly consult that section of the rule book pertaining to neckwear.
You mean Section 3, Paragraph 4, which states: "A tie must be worn with a Windsor knot".
But it doesn't say where.
Take a seat.
Now may we turn our attention to history?
Thomas Paine once wrote - Mr. Smith?
- Weren't you the bad guy in Goldfinger?
- Smooth.
- Looking great.
- Sharp.
Look at that.
- It's a little something I put together.
Smith, ho!
- My man Lieberbaum.
- Right.
First name Kellogg.
Listen, Cornflake.
"Ho" is definitely not a word that you want to yell.
I think the word you're looking for is "yo".
"Yo"?
Yeah.
It'll be easy to remember.
It's like "oy" backwards.
All right.
Will.
Yo.
Will, may I have a word?
You got something you want to say to me, man?
Can you be serious for just one moment?
Will, this is your first day.
And I think you're rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.
Carlton, here in Boys Town I don't want to rub anybody any way.
That's not funny.
Nothing you say is funny.
What, did you like pass out in history class?
I had them rolling.
The people who count were laughing at you, not with you.
I mean it, Will.
When you're snubbed, don't say that I did not warn you.
Hey, Will.
How's it going?
- There you are.
- Okay, here comes Chadney.
Just lay low and watch how it's done.
Are you free this weekend, Smithy?
My parents are throwing a weekend bash at our compound in Malibu.
Badminton, the lobster boil, you know, the usual.
Yes, the usual.
The Chadster's Malibu bashes are legendary.
Carlton, you should come, too.
Bang-bang.
My man Geoffrey.
- Master William.
- You know what I could go for right now?
- Some pati.
- Then by all means, go.
Might I recommend the gourmet deli on Roxbury?
When I said I could go for it, I mean, like, I want it like you go for it.
Wilbert thought his first day at Bel-Air Academy was a big success.
When he told his aunt and uncle, they were thrilled.
This is cause for celebration.
Geoffrey, Will did well at school.
This calls for champagne.
There's been a tragedy at the school.
The alumni desk has been cruelly and wantonly defaced.
- What happened?
- Someone carved the word "fresh" in it.
And they have a theory about the person who did it.
They do?
They think it was a freshman who got halfway through and lost his cool.
He lost his cool?
That's funny.
"Fresh" means cool, right, Will?
I can't keep up with this crazy teenage slang.
But I thought they call you the Fresh Prince.
Day damn one, Vivian.
Champagne.
Cork it.
All I can say to you, Will, is tsk squared.
You thought you had the school all figured out.
No.
You didn't need my advice.
All right, Carlton, what is your brilliant advice?
I'll tell you.
You've gotta march straight into school tomorrow and confess.
I'm serious, Will.
There's such a thing as the honor code.
There's such a thing as dog dumb, too.
- You don't intend to tell them?
- Maybe on my deathbed.
Then on your conscience be it.
Before we begin the class, I must speak about the atrocious defiling of our sacred alumni desk.
Fingerprint analysis has shown it is the handiwork of our resident hoodlum, William Smith.
And may we turn our attention to another important figure in American history.
Dolley Madison was one of our most influential First Ladies and not, as Mr. Smith contends the manufacturer of Ring Dings.
In the short time left, I'd like to address the infamous act of vandalism which occurred here yesterday.
The desecration of our desk is indeed sad but even sadder is the fact that no one has yet come forward with a confession.
- So if any of you may know - He did it.
Can you believe it?
Wilbert was accused by his evil cousin Carlton I mean, Carlbert.
I don't get what's scary about this story.
There aren't any werewolves or vampires or anything.
But we're coming to the scary part.
Poor Wilbert was brought to trial before the scariest monsters of all: Preppies.
As president of student council, I declare this tribunal in session.
Let's begin by hearing from Mr. Smith.
Will, will you finally take my advice?
Let me do the talking for you.
Gentlemen, my cousin has committed a vicious crime.
He could not be guiltier.
Yeah.
That's what I would have said.
The fact is, young Will has not yet developed the social skills to adapt to the rarefied atmosphere of Bel-Air Academy or parties in Malibu.
I recommend we put him on probation, ban him from all clubs sports, special events, the Alligaroos.
No, not the Alligaroos.
Probation is not enough.
If Smith isn't expelled, it will be an invitation to anarchy.
I have to say that I am appalled at this tribunal's lack of sensitivity.
Speak on, bro.
We can't judge Will Smith by our standards.
He doesn't even speak our language.
Where he grew up, the word "bad" means "good".
Doesn't that say it all?
Fight the power.
- Will, do you have anything to say?
- Yeah.
I didn't think y'all was gonna get so mad for me writing my name on an old desk.
I'd never write my name on a new desk.
That's vandalism.
But those guys, they carved their name in a new desk.
They got their picture on the wall.
That's totally different.
They carved their names so people would remember them as part of the school.
That's why I did it.
That's ridiculous.
You're trying to ruin our school.
- No, he isn't.
- Lieberbaum, you're out of order.
But he's not ruining the school.
He's making it better.
Word up, Cornflake.
I don't mean to dis you guys but if Will's expelled, I'm leaving, too and I'm taking my dad's checkbook with me.
Free Will!
I'm going to bed.
I hope you realize how lucky you were that you weren't kicked out of school.
Lucky?
I gotta work every day after school to pay off the desk repair.
Before I cry myself to sleep may I leave you with a few words of advice?
If at some point tomorrow, or during my lifetime for that matter you come up with another brilliant idea for something to do at school, stop.
Do nothing.
Just stand there doing nothing saying nothing arms at your side like a zombie.
Breathing just enough to keep the blood circulating.
And no more.
Could you do that for me?
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
I wasn't listening.
What did you say?
Good night, Will.
Lock your door when you go to bed.
Will, before I go to bed, I just want to say I was proud of you tonight, old sport.
Kudos.
You took your punishment like a man.
- That's all you got to say?
- Good night?
- Carlton, you Five-Oed me, man.
- Excuse me?
- You dimed me out.
- Pardon?
You tattled on me, all right?
I did it for your own good.
You weren't going to tell.
How do you know?
You didn't give me a chance.
You're not worried about my own good.
You're just worried about yourself.
It may seem like that to you now, but one day, you will Carlton, shut up!
I know what this is about.
You thought you were this big hotshot at school and I was gonna be your little charity case, but I took your juice.
Let me explain something to you.
In this society, we have this silly little thing called order and we have rules to preserve that order.
If we let people break the rules, there would be chaos.
We have rules where I'm from, too.
And they say you don't rat on people.
The more you cling to your old ways and refuse to listen to reality the harder it's going to be for you to fit in with my friends.
You just don't get it, do you, man?
I don't want your friends.
All right?
If I woke up one morning and I had all of your friends and I was an Alligaroo and I wore those cute shirts with the little horses on them I'd jump off the Empire State Building and hope to catch my eyelid on a nail.
With quips like that, it's no wonder you're the toast of the town.
Good night, Will.
Master William.
I have been informed that due to your new after-school employment you will no longer be requiring your customary 4:00 snack.
Could this be true?
Yeah, afraid so, G. I might not even get home till dinner time, if that early.
What a pity.
Out of curiosity just what is the nature of your enforced labor?
Kitchen duty.
Fetching, cleaning, carrying, that kind of stuff.
Indeed.
Oh, well.
Chin up.
Picture this if you will my man Wilbert in a kitchen with a hair net on his head.
If that's not a scary thought, I don't know what is.
So look.
You all gotta do me a favor.
Raise your right hand.
I want your solemn promise that if any of you ever meets Wilbert Smithsonian you won't tell him I told you this story, okay?
- Swear?
- I swear, Wilbert Smithsonian.
Will's cold busted.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
And then came the Third Day of Christmas and still no one had made a present for Santa.
Whom shall I ask to help me, boys and girls?
I know.
Ask the reindeer on your left hand.
I'd love to help but I have my hooves full as it is.
I get it.
His hooves are full.
He don't have no hands, I get it.
Hey, G, I did not see that coming.
This is dope, right, Ash?
- Ashley!
- I'm awake.
I don't know why I bother.
It's impossible to compete with tawdry entertainment like MTV, Nintendo the new children on the block.
Thanks a lot, Ash.
Now I'll never know how the story ends.
I really wanted to know what Santa got for Christmas.
He doesn't get an actual gift, Will.
He gets the love of all the little children in the world.
Really?
What a gyp.
Come on, Will.
Everyone knows there's no Santa Claus.
Wait a minute, there is no Milli Vanilli but there definitely is a Santa Claus.
Okay, Ash, let's write our letters to Santa Claus.
Here, you can help me with my list.
How do you spell "Vanessa Williams"?
Don't you have anything better to do with Christmas vacation than writing a silly letter?
What are you gonna do with your vacation?
Play with your friends?
I wish I had someone to play with but every year my friends all go out of town and I'm stuck here all alone.
You can still have fun while you're here.
I'm going to.
I've decided to learn a new word every day.
Ashley, that's boring.
Really?
I think it's very autodidactic.
Christmas vacation is finally here.
God help me, I do love it so.
I thought you liked school, Carlton.
Ash, I think Bel-Air Academy is one of the best schools in the country.
Its academics and sports program are excellent, and the faculty is first-rate but around December 10, it starts to get a little old.
Know what I mean?
Carlton, we got a problem.
Your sister, 10 years old and doesn't know the meaning of Christmas.
I know the meaning of "undulate".
I don't know where this Christmas thing's going, but I've got bigger fish to fry.
I've got to raise $600 more for my Glee Club ski trip.
Give you $1 if you shave your head.
I've booked the Alligaroos to sing at a bunch of Christmas parties.
If we make enough money, on December 26 we'll all be Imitating Jerry Lewis?
I've got to rehearse now.
Guys, let's use this room.
Let's start with our opening number.
Five, six, five, six, seven, and Hold it!
What the bloody hell kind of song is that?
What do you mean?
A little kid sees his mom tongue-wrestling with Santa Claus?
Will, it's his father dressed up like Santa Claus.
Why'd he dress up like I get it.
I dress up like Santa Claus.
You dress up like the Easter Bunny.
That makes me sick.
We're putting together a program for Jonathan's parents' party tonight.
Jonathan's stepfather is a record producer and he asked us not to do tired old Christmas carols.
Here's our program.
Wait a minute.
You Don't Bring Me Flowers People Who Need People, The Way We Were.
Who's coming down the chimney, Barbra Streisand?
You've been to my parents' parties?
That would be fantastic.
All right.
Also, I want to send a box of the fancy chocolate-covered pretzels to Mr. Patrick Swayze.
Right.
The card should read: "Pat, saw these and immediately thought of you.
Love, Hilary.
XXX".
Send the same thing to Kevin Costner, Michelle Pfeiffer and Sting.
Great, thanks.
That takes care of the A-list.
Now, should I send the box of pears or the meat thermometer to Steve Guttenberg?
Hilary, I hate to inject some reality into these proceedings but who you trying to fool, baby?
What do you mean?
You always walk around fronting like you know all these famous people.
You don't know nobody.
Will, you are so jaded and skeptical.
You remind me so much of Judd Nelson.
Philip, we'll spend an hour at your office party, then we'll come home.
- I have papers to grade.
- Okay, but first things first.
Do you remember the names of all my partners' wives?
Yes.
- Who is George Meyer's wife?
- Eunice.
That was last year.
The new wife's name is Kelly.
Kelly?
Walter's secretary?
- Now, who is Jack Fitzgerald's wife?
- Doris.
The correct answer is Heather, formerly the muffin-cart girl.
Wait a minute.
How many new wives are going to be at this party?
Let's put it this way, Vivian.
You're the only repeat.
Hold up.
You guys going to a Christmas party?
- It's just an office Christmas party.
- I remember ours back in Philly.
The building would be filled with the sounds of Christmas.
Jingle bells and singing and laughing.
Then at the end of the evening, the traditional police sirens.
Those were the days.
I'll just go bring the car around.
Aunt Viv, does this neighborhood do anything special for Christmas?
Not really.
Last year, President Reagan's Secret Service agents dressed up as Santa and warned everyone to keep their distance.
That was kind of festive.
Aunt Viv, this is terrible.
People in Bel-Air don't know how to celebrate Christmas.
- I'm worried about Ashley.
- What do you mean?
Growing up in Bel-Air, she never had a real Christmas.
There's no sledding, there's no caroling there's no winos making snow angels on the front lawn.
You don't even decorate the living room.
Yes, we do.
We've already started.
The poinsettias, the red candles and here's the beautiful crystal nativity your uncle gave me for Christmas years ago.
Where's little baby Jesus?
- Right there.
- That little disk?
There are more decorations coming.
A wonderful shop in Beverly Hills comes to the house, sets up the tree and decorates it for us.
Do they open your presents and wear your sweaters, too?
If you want to show Ashley a little more of the Christmas spirit why don't you go to the shop, pick up the decorations and you and Ashley can decorate it yourself, okay?
All right, then.
This is going to be hype.
Have fun at the office Christmas party.
Thanks, I'm looking forward to meeting all the new wives.
I hope they bring their Barbie dolls.
Will, were you vociferating for me?
I got to get back to you on that.
You want to go to Beverly Hills with me and get the decorations?
- Okay.
- We can sing Christmas songs all the way.
Great.
Here's one Carlton taught me.
Hi.
Merry Christmas.
Aren't these figures outstanding?
They're beyond outstanding, they're deeply beyond.
They're hand-carved.
We import them from Poland.
We're looking for some Christmas decorations.
Let me show you something we're doing now that's deeply happening.
It's a Caribbean Christmas tree.
It's very big in London, it's beyond big.
It's all about very hot oranges and very intense yellows.
I feel it's a very vibrant tree, and I feel it's a very important tree.
We're just picking up the decorations for my mother, Mrs. Banks.
Yeah, she phoned and told me you'd be putting them up yourselves this year, which is fine.
You'll save yourself a little money, which is a good thing because the '90s are going to be all about restraint.
Is this the wreath for the door?
Yeah.
Let's talk about that wreath for a moment, if you will.
Last year, I was so deeply into the distant salmons and the sandy beiges.
But this year I went more with the muted roses with these little arrogant touches of celadon and periwinkle.
I think it worked out quite nice.
Let's try something wild here, you know?
Do you have anything red or green or, I don't know, maybe something like a Santa Claus?
It's been done.
Excuse us.
These decorations are wack.
We'll save Aunt Viv a lot of money and buy them somewhere else.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
You forgot your box of decorations.
No, you see, we're going to do our own decorations this year.
It's going to be about arrogant little elves and rambunctious reindeer and little men in red suits.
I think it will be deeply, deeply dope.
We should've left that stupid office party an hour earlier.
I still have 30 papers to grade.
We're both busy, but we can't work in the car so why don't we take this time to relax a bit?
You're right.
Look how nicely they decorated the house on the corner.
Those white lights on the tree outside.
Just the right touch of lights.
A little goes a long way, you know.
God, I used to love Christmas when I was little.
Now it just rushes by in one big blur.
Christmas is more for kids.
You know, even though we're busy I think we should do something nice for Will.
Must be hard for him spending Christmas in a strange place.
Yeah, you're right, sweetheart.
We'll do something nice for him.
Surprise!
- Ashley, sweetie.
- Where's Will?
- Aren't you surprised, Mommy?
- Where is Will?
I had so much fun today with Will, you can't believe it.
Surprise!
Look, it's Will.
Will, what happened at the Christmas shop?
Aunt Viv, they were trying to rip you off.
So me and Ashley went down to the Pick 'n' Grab.
Hello.
Yes, this is Philip Banks.
You saw our lights.
The blinking Frosty the Snowman is riling your attack dogs.
That's wonderful.
Our neighbors are furious.
We must take down the lights.
Uncle Phil, I bet there's a lot of neighbors that love those decorations.
I mean, certainly anyone who possesses good taste.
Banks residence.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.
Brother, you got a problem with my lights?
Why don't you come tell me that to my face, then?
You can do whatever you want to do.
It's your world, squirrel.
I'm just trying to get a nut.
What?
We can do this.
That was clever, Trevor.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
Yeah, all right.
Madam, sir.
A group of your neighbors have assembled on the front lawn.
They're looking at your Christmas decorations and growing enraged.
They are threatening to burn Frosty in effigy.
We'd better get out there.
Geoffrey, thanks for helping us put up those Christmas decorations.
I'd have never had the guts to climb up on that roof with that reindeer strapped on my back.
Anything in the name of Christmas, Master William.
Your aunt and uncle didn't suspect anything, did they?
No.
Still, I think it's best we avoid eye contact for the rest of the evening.
- Should I talk to them?
Or do you want to?
- No, I'll give it a try.
- Dad, can I offer a suggestion?
- Sure.
They're our neighbors and they're upset.
It's up to us to make sure that this doesn't ruin their Christmas.
There's only one way to do that.
I think we should write a few checks.
Sit down, Carlton.
As you wish, Father.
I'll have to tell them we'll take the decorations down as soon as we can.
Can't we leave some of them up?
I don't know, maybe we can reach a compromise.
Everybody, in keeping with the spirit of the season I think we can discuss this rationally.
Property values in this neighborhood must be vigorously protected.
Isn't that right, Mr. Uesato?
I'm afraid potential buyers aren't too crazy about the Kmart look.
You know dear, there are wonderful services that will come and decorate your house for you.
But this year our daughter and nephew decided to do the decorating themselves.
I see.
Are they very angry with you over something?
No, why?
This reminds me of the summer my daughter Amanda turned 15 and tried to burn our house down.
Master William.
There is a gentleman in the foyer who claims you had some harsh words with him on the phone.
Oh, yeah?
That chump is here?
Send him in.
Fighting doesn't solve anything.
Aunt Viv, ain't gonna be no fight.
I can tell by the sound of this guy's voice on the phone, I could take him in a minute.
Mr. Evander Holyfield.
The undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.
Nice champion.
I recognize your voice.
You're the chump I talked to on the telephone.
Phone?
I ain't talked to you on no phone.
- Evander.
- Hilary.
You know her?
Where were you last night at Bruce Willis' party?
I'm not speaking to Bruce.
I'll tell you about it later.
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't know you lived here.
Frankly, I saw the lights and I thought they were a little tacky.
Look!
I didn't mean for everybody to get so upset.
You might as well just take all the lights down.
- Ashley.
- It's okay, Dad.
Now, come on.
The house looks dope.
Who cares what they think?
Bet you Santa thinks it's nice.
I know you're trying to get me into the Christmas spirit but I'm just not into it.
All those people are in a bad mood none of my friends are around to play with.
I'm going to go up to my room learn some new word and wait until New Year's.
That was great.
Who are you guys?
- Hi, I'm Mark Driscoll.
- How you doing?
Every year, I take the neighborhood kids around to look at the Christmas lights.
They choose one house as the best-decorated then sing carols for the people who live there.
- This year, you guys won.
- We drove all over.
Yeah, and usually this neighborhood is a complete dud.
We weren't even going to come here until Jimmy saw the house from the freeway.
I tell you what, we've got cookies and hot chocolate inside.
Come on in.
All right, let's go.
- Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Ashley, I seem to remember you saying you wanted some friends and there they are.
Still don't believe that there's a Santa Claus?
I'm glad we cleared up this little matter.
I assume the lights will be down by tomorrow.
Wait.
I've changed my mind.
- I want the lights to stay up.
- Fight the power, Ashley.
I love them.
They're beautiful.
I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Will thinks so, too, and so do all these kids.
And besides, it's Christmas.
When I look at the lights and the reindeer and the decorations it makes me feel very ebullient.
Yeah, me, too.
Ashley's right.
What are we arguing about here?
When we were kids, we used to all love Christmas.
And now we take things too seriously.
Personally, I think the lights are kind of neat.
I guess they're really not hurting anybody.
And the kids really like them.
We shouldn't be fighting.
It's so barbaric.
Then we're all agreed?
I think those decorations are totally inappropriate for a home in Bel-Air.
Madam, another of your neighbors has arrived.
Great, that's all we need.
Excuse me.
Hello, everybody.
Hi, there, Hilary.
Thanks for the pretzels.
I'm sorry to bother you, neighbor.
I just want to say that I greatly admire your wonderful Christmas decorations and I just wanted to say that because Nancy won't let me do anything fun to our house.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- It's a pleasure.
A few of our neighbors came to tell us about our lights, too.
What were you saying, Mr. Grey?
I was just saying they were absolutely magnificent, Mr. President.
- That's what I think.
- This is what Christmas is all about.
Now comes the magic moment.
Everybody gather around the TV.
Will, what are you doing?
This is one of our Christmas traditions.
I like to watch out for this certain commercial.
A commercial?
You know the one where it's all snowy and the little jolly Santa is riding on a Norelco shaver?
I love that commercial.
And that Christmas beer commercial with the horses with the furry feet are pulling the sleigh through the snow.
I loved that commercial where the little covered wagon is being chased by the dog across the kitchen floor.
He's on the shaver!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
He: Helium.
Li: Lithium.
Na: Sodium.
Zn: Zinc.
Uncle Phil, please.
Do you mind turning the music back on?
I'm trying to study.
I'm expecting a very important client.
We have a golfing date and I'd appreciate it if you could study somewhere else.
Okay, I get it.
You're trying to impress him.
That's right.
You might want to change them pants.
- Good morning, sweetie.
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- What time is Jameson getting here?
- What are you wearing, Vivian?
Excuse me?
That red blouse.
That's Jameson's bad-luck color.
This happens to be my favorite blouse so he can just go find himself another bad-luck color.
Maybe he can pick one out of Uncle Phil's pants.
Vivian, please change.
I know he's a little superstitious but his big account helps to pay our little bills.
All set for a great game of golf, Dad.
Carlton, what is it, recess at the clown convention?
That's right.
And by the way, Will, who cut your hair, Ray Charles?
I've been saving that one for a week.
Don't even try to top it.
That must be Jameson.
Vivian, humor him.
- Mr. Jameson Whitworth.
- Jameson, how are you?
Fine.
Vivian, it's lovely to see you again.
And it's nice seeing you, Jameson.
- How are you, Mr. Whitworth?
- Not great.
My caddy called me on the car phone a few minutes ago and canceled.
I've learned my lesson: Never trust a Leo.
Ain't that the truth?
Back in Philly I knew this guy named Leo Brentley.
The dude tried to steal my lucky drawers.
- You have a pair of lucky drawers?
- Well, yeah.
- So do I. - This is all very interesting.
Carlton, you can caddy for both of us.
Shall we go, gentlemen?
Wait a second.
I have a very good feeling about this.
How would you like to be my caddy?
I ain't down with carrying golf clubs.
It's $50, plus tip.
Fore!
This is the worst round of golf I've ever played.
Well, the green's a little wet today.
- That's what's wrong.
- What?
A hole in one!
I made a hole in one.
The first time in my life.
- Some shot, Mr. Whitworth.
- Congratulations, Jameson.
Did you see that, Will?
It's because your hat's turned to the side, you can see better.
No.
There's more to it than that.
There is?
Jameson, let me buy lunch.
- A hole in one calls for a celebration.
- I'll say.
I have to make it quick.
I have to get back to the office.
I'm making a major investment in Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
- Maybe I'll get lucky again, Will.
- That's wack.
"Wack".
In what sense of the word?
It's Saturday afternoon.
All you're thinking about is work.
That's got to be hurting you with the girlies.
Will, please.
Forget about the office, forget about that stock.
Just max and relax.
Kick back and enjoy yourself.
Go home and let your wife know she's still got it.
You're right.
Doggone it, you're right.
Doggone it, I'm right.
Geoffrey, I really think I made an impression on Mr. Whitworth.
And was your sucking up as successful as you'd hoped?
I'll say.
I'm gonna apply for a summer job with his company.
But, Carlton, Dad's his lawyer.
Isn't that kind of using a connection?
I can't believe it, Vivian.
Jameson made a hole in one, and he's not a very good golfer.
- What's his handicap, sir?
- Ain't it obvious?
Everybody, the working girl is home.
- How was your day?
- I love working in an art gallery.
I'm learning so much.
I just told my boss, "Teach me.
I'm a blank slate".
At least you're honest.
- What exactly do you do in this job?
- This is a very exclusive art gallery.
So, they're trying to maintain a certain atmosphere.
So, when customers come in the door, I ignore them.
If they ask me about a piece of art, I look right through them.
If they ask for a price, I go like this And walk away.
Hilary, it sounds like they hired you to be a snob.
I guess they saw something in me.
- Mr. Whitworth.
- Hello.
- Jameson, this is a surprise.
- Actually, Philip, I'm not here to see you.
- I told you I impressed him, Ashley.
- I'm here to see Will.
No, sir, my name is Carlton.
I know that.
I'd like to see Will.
I'll get him.
Vivian, I brought this for you.
- What is it?
- It's a sprig of wolfsbane.
Hang it over your kitchen door and all will be well.
But Jameson, everything's fine in our kitchen.
That you know of.
What's up, J?
I'll tell you what.
You saved me a lot of money.
Word?
On the golf course, you told me not to buy Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
The stock dropped 10 points today.
Jameson, I think you're reading a little too much into this.
I don't know nothing about stocks.
It was just luck.
Precisely.
You're a good-luck charm.
I would've lost millions, but thanks to my "Yo, homey" here I didn't.
So what you're saying is thanks to me, you got lucky twice yesterday.
Three times.
The wife girlie will be smiling for months.
You have a bright future, young man.
This is no fair.
There are many forces at work in the universe, Will.
For example, the power in numbers.
The four arms of the Mutable Cross, Virgo.
When the moon is in the seventh house.
The sixth-ray energies, Saturn to Neptune the seventh sun, born for good luck all numbers.
Yeah.
Jameson, why don't I fix you a drink?
I don't drink.
I like to keep my mind clear.
I think he's cleared it out pretty well.
My lucky numbers have always been three and seven.
- Will, when's your birthday?
- July 3.
- What year?
- 1973.
So you were born on 7-3-73 my lucky numbers.
Jameson, that's just a coincidence.
Coincidence?
I don't think so.
- I was born August 4, 1974.
- A Leo?
Will, I have an assignment for you.
I want you to go through these files.
They're about a company called Innermark.
I've been analyzing the data for months trying to decide whether or not I should buy it.
You want me to read all this?
That's not necessary.
Just feel the pages.
Tell me what kind of energy you get back.
Jameson, I have to say this all sounds a little Insane?
unorthodox.
You have an excellent brokerage firm to advise you.
J, straight up, I don't know nothing about this stuff.
Will, you don't know that you know but believe me, you know.
Man, I don't know.
Exactly.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Philip, Vivian, have a nice day.
Why is that man running loose on the streets without medication?
He's a little eccentric, Vivian, but he has a brilliant financial mind.
He does?
Philip, why don't you tell Will about Sparky?
I don't think we need to go into that.
Last year Jameson was taking all of his stock advice from his dog.
That's untrue, Vivian.
He only took tax advice from Sparky.
Then, last spring Sparky met with an untimely run-in with a milk truck but of course, that didn't stop Jameson from talking to him.
He talks to the spirit of a dead dog?
No.
He had him stuffed and put in his office.
Uncle Phil, why do you humor this guy?
The planet he's on ain't even been discovered yet.
He's an important client and he's just entrusted you with a very serious financial decision.
- This has got to be handled delicately.
- What am I supposed to do?
Tomorrow, you to go down to Whitworth's Capital Investments find Jameson Whitworth and tell him that you're a 17-year-old kid and you're in no position to give financial advice.
Exactly.
That's Sparky's job.
Your main man is in effect, Mr. Whitworth.
Thank you, Gladys.
Will, come in.
What's going on, J?
You know, I just wanted to come so Is something wrong, Will?
No.
Look, I'm a little pressed for time, so let's just get right to the point.
Excellent.
All right, Will, Innermark Industries.
Do we buy this stock or not?
Look, that's what I came to talk to you about.
I don't think I'm in any position to give you financial advice.
I'm only 17.
Did you say 17?
This is a sign.
Will, look at this.
This machine gives me stock quotes.
What price has Innermark been trading at all day?
Seventeen.
You've done it again, Will.
I'm calling my broker.
Wait, I really don't think you should Miles?
Buy me one million shares of Innermark Industries.
Right.
Done.
You bought a million shares of stock because I told you I was 17?
That's right.
This is just one big coincidence.
Besides, I'm about to turn 18.
- Did you say 18?
- No.
Yes, you did.
Look at this, Will.
The stock just went up to $18.
You just made me $1 million.
That doesn't mean anything, Mr. Whitworth.
I can understand you being frightened by your powers.
But there are forces at work in the universe beyond our understanding.
Don't fight them, Will.
Learn to accept them and there will always be a place for you here.
You know, Will's been gone for hours.
I wonder how his meeting with Mr. Whitworth is going.
Nothing to worry about, Ashley.
Traffic from Mars is very heavy this time of day.
I'm home.
Carlton, get the camera.
I want a picture of me opening my first paycheck.
- Congratulations, baby.
- That's wonderful.
I'm so excited.
Mom, Dad, I'll start paying my own way around here and I won't accept no for an answer.
You still owe me $5 for those magazines you bought.
Ashley, don't be petty.
- All set.
- Here goes.
Don't you all feel like a part of history?
What?
Federal taxes?
This is an outrage.
Didn't President Bush say, "No new taxes"?
But federal taxes aren't new.
They are to me.
And who is this FICA guy?
Hilary, taxes are taken out of everybody's salary.
They pay for highways, national defense, and housing programs.
I thought the government was supposed to pay for all that.
Okay, I know the solution.
I'm going to demand a raise.
Hilary, you've only been there a week.
Nobody starts at the top.
Yeah.
Lunch on the company yacht?
Yeah, that sounds great, Jameson.
Let's say you have the limo pick me up noon-ish.
Yeah, all right.
Peace back at you, babe.
Will, I want you to return all that stuff before the cops get here.
What are you tripping?
J gave me this stuff as a little thank-you gift.
- For what?
- I made him $1 million.
That may seem like a lot, Will, but wait till they take out all the taxes.
Will, how did you make Jameson $1 million?
To be honest, I have no idea.
Jameson seems to think I'm good luck.
Will, there's no such thing as good luck or bad luck.
Yes, there is.
I've got bad luck.
You look handsome, Will.
Nice suit.
You like it, Ash?
Custom-made.
Size 42, extra fly.
When you work for Whitworth, you get all the fringe benefits.
Does he need a butler?
Just asking.
For a friend.
Will, you don't really think you're capable of giving financial advice, do you?
Aunt Viv there are forces at work in this universe that are beyond our understanding.
And if these forces want to give me a limo a cellular phone, and an Armani suit who are we to argue with them?
Will, I sent you there to get out of this arrangement with Jameson and now you're in deeper than before.
I know.
I just feel terrible.
Am I showing enough cuff?
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna put an end to this.
Yes, Philip Banks for Jameson Whitworth.
Yes, I've been talking to Will here.
First of all, I'd like to say he's very flattered but it's a little risky having a high-school student give financial advice.
As your lawyer, I'd advise you put an end to it.
Sure, you want to talk to him yourself?
Okay.
Yo, J. What up, coolie-bop?
Really?
Really?
Yeah, if that's the way you want it, that's cool.
All right.
Peace.
What did he say?
Uncle Phil, you're fired.
So, is Mr. Whitworth ready to see us yet?
He's still in there talking to his homey.
You'll just have to chill.
All right.
We can't afford to lose Whitworth's account.
- We need a game plan.
- I thought we had agreed on groveling.
Yes, but we need to straighten out the order in which we grovel.
I'll go first.
Since my father founded the law firm, I can make an emotional plea.
Philip, you can remind him of all our dedicated service to his company.
- What do I say?
- Nothing.
You're only here because his lucky number is three.
Of course.
J, come on, man, you've got to meet with them.
- They're sitting right outside.
- Straight up, pop.
I'm sorry, but the aura is wack.
What did you say, Sparky?
He's talking?
He hasn't talked in weeks.
You think it's a good idea to have the meeting?
Word?
What's that?
Go ahead with the meeting?
Send them in right away.
There you have it.
Sparky says have the meeting.
Well, all right.
It's two against one.
Gladys, send them in, please.
- Jameson, good to see you.
- Have a seat.
- Will, excuse us, please.
- Sure.
He stays.
I want him here.
Sparky wants him here.
Okay.
Jameson, Furth, Wind & Meyer has represented you for the past 20 years.
And I think I speak for all the lawyers in the firm when I say that we're dedicated to continuing in that capacity.
So?
Lawyers are a dime a dozen.
There's some truth in that.
You had an interesting point you wanted to make, didn't you?
Yes, Henry.
Jameson, to elaborate on what Henry was saying, it Yes?
What?
This is terrible.
- What's the matter?
- That was my broker.
Innermark stock is plummeting.
It's already down 10 points.
My God, it's already down to $6 a share.
It's down to $5, $4, $3 Great.
That's your lucky number.
I just lost a fortune.
Will, you owe me $14 million.
Here's $5.
This is serious.
Don't you know anything?
No.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Why did you tell me to buy that stock?
You're out of your mind.
I'm out of my mind?
You're the one that's got Lassie as your vice president.
You're not lucky.
You're unlucky.
You're a curse.
Get out of my office.
- Don't you talk to him like that.
- Excuse me?
It's your fault he's involved in this.
This isn't the first time that your craziness has got us in hot water.
Last January, on my birthday when I could have been home with my wife and family, where was I?
Stuck in the office buried under paperwork because Sparky chased a Buick and you thought that was his way of telling you to take over General Motors.
Jameson, I am through with your craziness.
If that means we lose a $20 million account, then so be it.
Jameson, I think that's Philip's way of saying "I'm sorry".
- Why didn't you ever say this before?
- I should have.
Absolutely.
I had no idea your birthday was in January.
You're a Capricorn.
My horoscope says a Capricorn will lead me to prosperity.
Philip, you're just the goat I've been looking for.
Gentlemen, welcome back.
The way you stood up for me, Uncle Phil, you were all that.
- I didn't like the way he was treating you.
- So what happened next?
Uncle Phil told him he could take his big account fold it five ways and stick it where Sparky can't find it.
- Wow, Dad, that took guts.
- Well done, sir.
You know, I've always wished I had the nerve to tell off my employers.
Daddy, you've been a wonderful example for me.
How much abuse can one person take for the sake of a job?
There are lots of things about my boss that bug me.
And I've been putting up with him for a whole week.
It's time to take action.
Hilary, I don't want you to go screaming at your boss.
Can you?
Philip, I am really proud of you.
Life is too short to put up with the Jameson Whitworths of the world.
Straight up, Uncle Phil.
I can't believe that loon changed his mind because you told him you were a Capricorn.
Capricorn?
Philip, your birthday's January 30.
You're an Aquarius.
Vivian, for a $20 million account, I'm a Capricorn.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hey, Kellogg, how was your weekend?
Complete disaster, Carlton.
I took this girl to see New Kids on the Block and all night she's saying, "Donnie's so cute.
"Donnie's so sweet, Donnie's so hunky".
What does Donnie have that I don't have?
My guess is you don't have the right stuff.
All right, men, it's History time.
Smith, you're late.
Sorry about that, Coach, but I thought I'd run a few laps before class.
Help out the old basketball team.
Good idea, Smith.
Good way to stay ahead of the competition.
Might not be a bad idea for all you men who are on the team to start the day with a few laps.
We run enough laps at basketball practice, Coach Smiley.
Okay, Hunt, we're not in the gym.
Therefore, you are to refer to me by my official teaching name: Professor Smiley.
And for that little slip of the tongue, All right, men.
Before we start the next chapter in our History books I'm going to give back the pop quiz from Friday.
I want you all to take these home and bring them back signed by your parents.
I think I aced this one.
How about you, Will?
I think I did just fine.
and the way that you write your "A" shows you're intelligent and playful.
You can tell all that from just my signature?
- Yup.
- That's amazing.
Do me, do me!
Sign right there, under Ashley.
Okay.
So what do you see about me?
Well, the bold vertical strokes show that you're impulsive.
The large capital letters show that you're committed.
And the little smiley face you use to dot your "l" shows that you got way too much time on your hands.
That's all true.
Who does it say I'm going to marry?
"Handsome movie star, who will only be happy "if you spend obscene amounts of money".
You're good.
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, honey.
Daddy, Will knows how to analyze people's handwriting.
He's quite good, sir.
One look at my signature and he deduced that I was valiant ingenious, and have the strength of 10.
- Let me do yours, Uncle Phil.
- No, I don't believe in that nonsense.
I'd hardly call it nonsense.
Please, Daddy, it's fun.
All right.
Where do I sign?
No, Uncle Phil.
You deserve a fresh piece of paper.
- How about you, Aunt Viv?
- Sure.
Why not?
Will, this is always such a sad moment.
What is?
Getting you and Mom to sign his "Hall of Shame" History exam.
History exam?
Sorry, Will.
Mom, Dad, if it's any consolation, I got an "A" on the test and I must say I found it very easy.
Carlton, Ashley, we'd like to talk to Will alone.
Will, what is going on here?
You do so well in English and Math.
How could you do so poorly in History?
It's not my fault.
That class is boring.
Don't give us that, Will.
No, what I meant was they don't teach the whole story.
We don't learn nothing about the Black people in American history.
If they taught that, maybe I'd be more interested and work harder.
That's not a bad idea.
- It's not?
- It's not?
It's not?
Carlton, stop eavesdropping!
Sorry, Mom.
This does not excuse your bad grade but you've made a good point about the curriculum.
So we all agree here?
None of this is any of my fault?
This has been a very productive meeting.
Stay put.
You brought up a valid point here but if you want to learn Black history, what are you gonna do about it?
Don't just complain, baby, take action!
Write a statement about why more Black history should be added to the curriculum.
Present it at next week's parent-teachers' meeting.
I'll go with you.
- You will?
- You will?
You will?
The administration will consider the petition suggesting that we change the school motto to "Bel-Air Academy: Love lt "Or Go To Public School".
Any other new business?
Headmaster Armstrong, I have some.
Mr. Smith.
This should certainly be fly.
I think the students at this school are being cheated out of a valuable learning experience.
I'm talking about Coach Smiley's History class.
That's Professor Smiley, Smith.
That will be 10 laps.
What's your concern, Mr. Smith?
We learn about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and them other dudes that wound up on money but what about Martin Luther King and Crispus Attucks and all the other Black people that made a difference in this country?
It's like when there wasn't no pictures of any brothers on the wall.
You know Spike Lee's movie, Do the Right Thing?
I'm sorry.
The last movie I saw was Dead Poets Society.
With the right headmaster that would have been a completely different story.
Coach Smiley, would you care to respond to Mr. Smith?
All right.
I'd like to make three points.
First, in my course, we are trying to condense 200 and some odd years of history into nine months of lessons.
Obviously, we have to concentrate on some historical figures and exclude others.
That's true.
Second, our school has a fine library, or so I've been told where any student can study more about Black history.
Another good point.
Third: For years I have taught my course from this well-respected textbook and quite frankly, I don't know a lick more than what's in this book.
So forget it.
- But I think it's important.
- And it is.
Unfortunately, the school rulebook clearly states that any requests pertaining to curriculum changes be accompanied by A petition signed by 150 student signatures.
Article 4, Section 9.
Where'd you get ahold of that book?
It certainly will take some time to revise the curriculum.
What about having somebody come in to replace Coach Smiley for a month to teach some Black history?
A month off?
Armstrong, I think the kid's got something here.
Be that as it may, I'm sure it will be some while before we can find a teacher.
So, unless there's any other new business, this meeting is I hate to say this, Mr. Armstrong, but it sounds to me like you're stalling.
Not at all, Mrs. Banks we want to make sure that the person we get is properly qualified.
For example, a college professor with a Ph.
D who's taught Black History and Literature at the university level?
- Where would we find someone like that?
- You're looking at her.
See you in a month.
All right, now that we're studying something I know I'm gonna be the star of this class.
No, you're not.
I am.
What, are you tripping?
How do you figure that?
Because the teacher's my mommy.
Good morning, class.
Mom, I'd like to welcome you, and say, on behalf of the entire class how happy we are to have you here.
What did you call me, Mr. Banks?
What I always call you: "Mom".
My name is not "Mom".
My name is Professor Banks.
That is how I prefer to be addressed.
It that clear, class?
Yes, Professor Banks.
Black American history, gentlemen from Africa, to slavery, to the present.
We've all heard of Frederick Douglass Martin Luther King and Booker T. Washington.
But Black history includes a lot of people whose names and faces aren't remembered today.
How many of you have heard the spirituals sung by the slaves?
I have.
Now listen to this: That was pretty cool.
What do you suppose the purpose of that song was?
Let me handle this one.
For those of you unfamiliar with the spirituals allow me to explain.
The slaves used to sing them to keep their spirits up and their minds on God in the face of all the oppression that they suffered.
That was very well put, Mr. Smith, but you're wrong.
I beg your pardon?
That song was written to be used as a secret code of the Underground Railroad.
Secret code?
What do you mean?
Can anyone tell me what the Underground Railroad was?
Now, this one I know.
The Underground Railroad was a group of people that led the slaves to freedom.
When was it established?
During slavery.
That covers about 250 years, Mr. Smith.
Care to narrow it down a bit?
What do you mean, right now?
Sit down, Mr. Smith.
It was established during the 1840s.
Harriet Tubman, an ex-slave, was one of the leaders.
These gospel songs were actually secret messages sent to tell the runaway slaves how to get to freedom.
For example, "the drinking gourd" referred to the Big Dipper.
When the slaves sang Follow the Drinking Gourd that signaled to the runaway slaves to run towards the Big Dipper.
Along the route, they would meet with the abolitionist and escape to freedom.
That's what I meant.
Could you teach us one of the songs, Professor?
Here's one called Wade in the Water.
This song told runaway slaves that the best escape route was along the river.
Late at night, these songs could be heard coming from slave cabins along the route guiding the runaways to freedom.
Everybody, join in now.
Come on, now.
Now, all right.
Not bad, guys.
Next week's assignment will be a report on the Port Royal Experiment and the Penn School written by Mr. Smith.
Who, me?
This course was your idea.
I think it only fitting you be given the honor of the first assignment.
Congratulations, Will.
What an honor.
Mr. Smith will write the first half of the report the second half will be written by Mr. Banks.
Who, me?
I expect it to be at least 15 pages typed, double-spaced, with footnotes and a bibliography.
This course was a brilliant idea.
She's your mom!
I can't believe Mom picked us to do that special assignment.
Word.
Coach Smiley never would have did that.
He used to say, "Extra work for you "means extra work for me".
Excuse me.
Dibs on the tall one.
Excuse me, miss.
Maybe you can help me out here.
I've lost the feeling in my lips.
I'm Carlton Banks.
That's right, the Carlton Banks.
Want to slide out of here, get something to eat?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Will, Carlton, I've been looking for you.
I think class went pretty well today, don't you?
Yes.
Got to go.
Just a second.
I've got something for you.
This book will help you with your research paper.
It's about the Penn School.
Charlotte Forten was one of its first Black teachers and she Will!
- Are you listening to me?
- Of course.
You were talking about the Penn School.
What did I say about the Penn School?
It's right around the corner from the Pencil School?
Thanks, Mom.
Carlton, how many times do I have to tell you tuck in your shirt!
Look at you.
Honestly, Will those eyebrows!
Hurry up.
We're going to the library.
The tall one really liked me.
Geoffrey, I'm going on my first job interview at an art gallery and I need some advice.
You've been on a lot of job interviews, haven't you?
Why, yes, Miss Hilary.
I've worked my entire life.
Really?
Why?
Because I've always been partial to food and shelter.
Okay.
Anyway, I've been trying to prepare for this interview but every time I think about it, I get really nervous.
What do they ask you at these things?
It's nothing to be nervous about.
Just a few simple questions.
For example, what is your name?
- Hilary S. Banks.
- Education?
Two years of college.
What are your qualifications to work in an art gallery?
Well, I'm like An art gallery, to me, is like You know, it's like, okay.
When I walk into an art gallery, it's like Okay, if I had to choose, all right It's like, I mean Leave me alone!
You're hired.
- Is Aunt Viv here?
- Yes, she's in the kitchen.
Shall l No!
She can't know we're here.
She hasn't let us watch TV in a week.
I'm getting withdrawal symptoms.
My body needs a certain amount of microwaves.
Hi, guys.
How's that history class coming?
- Fine.
- Yeah.
Decent, I guess.
How are you doing with your term papers and your reading assignments and your economic graphs of the cotton industry?
Dad, if you don't mind, we'd rather not talk about History class.
Okay, suit yourself.
Uncle Phil, please.
If memory serves, this Black history class was your idea.
I didn't know Aunt Viv was gonna teach it.
She's driving us crazy.
Last night, I had a dream that I went to the prom with Harriet Tubman.
Will, I saw this coming.
You thought you'd get a free ride in that class, didn't you?
- No, I didn't.
- I sure did.
I don't have any sympathy for either one of you.
Just because she's good at teaching the class and making you do some hard work - you can't take it.
- Look, that's not it.
For her own good, you have to warn her if she keeps being so tough, the whole class is gonna revolt.
I can see it in the kids' faces.
They're on the edge.
Umoja.
What?
Umoja.
It's Swahili for "unity".
Dope, huh?
I got the whole Berlitz course on cassette for my oral report today.
Did you take my Jet magazine?
No, I've got my own subscription.
Good morning, class.
Who would like to make the first oral presentation?
Jonathan, you did your presentation yesterday.
But I've done a whole new presentation, just for fun.
Before we make our presentations we have something to say to you.
A bunch of us were at Chadney's house making our extra-credit dioramas and we started talking.
We agreed it's a shame you're going to leave at the end of the month.
Yeah, terrible.
- That's a wack situation.
- A shame.
So, anyway, we came up with this.
It's a petition for you to become our permanent history teacher.
Shoot me.
Guys I'm overwhelmed.
This is very flattering.
According to the rulebook, we need 150 signatures.
So far we've collected 148.
It'd be fun if the two signatures to put it over were Will and Carlton.
Guys, do the honors.
After you, Will.
No, you go ahead first.
I insist.
She's your mom.
This class was your idea.
Okay, listen, guys.
I'm very touched that you want me to stay but I don't think the university would approve.
- But I don't see - Let's get back to work.
Mr. Fletcher, would you care to give your report, please?
- Hi there, Aunt Viv.
- What are you doing?
Just grading papers.
The class coming over later?
Yeah.
Maybe you can tell us more about Harriet Tubman.
I never get enough of her.
I think you did get enough.
You thought one month was enough.
Mom, I'm sorry if I wasn't as enthusiastic as the rest of the guys.
You're a great teacher.
It's just I hope you don't take this the wrong way but you made our lives a living nightmare.
How did I do that?
You ragged me in front of the whole class.
You gave us all that extra work and made us do those reports.
I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of the class.
That's because you were harder on the two us.
I'm sorry you felt I was being hard on you but I thought the two Black students would actually want to get the most out of the course.
I guess we didn't think about it that way.
Mom.
Yes.
This whole ugly episode it's not going to affect my grade, will it?
I'm a very tough grader, Carlton.
And you're very beautiful, Mommy.
Will, there's one thing I've been wondering.
What's that?
Why did you want a course in Black history in the first place?
- I'm interested in it.
- Are you really?
Of course.
You didn't seem happy about all the work I was giving you.
Weren't you the one who said if you were interested in something, you would study hard?
Aunt Viv, I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X three times.
That makes you a serious student on Black history?
That's a very important book.
Will, you can read that book you can wear the T-shirts, put up the posters, and shout the slogans but unless you know all the history behind it you're trivializing the entire struggle.
Now you started something very good here but it's up to you to follow through on it.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
I'm telling you, Ashley, it's the perfect thing for Granny's visit.
Look, we enter here, we go past the llamas and giraffes take a look at the monkey house and then end with a ride on the Ferris wheel.
For the last time we are not breaking into Michael Jackson's house.
Man, what's up?
We're picking up Grandma from the airport.
She won't want to hear that garbage when she gets here.
The reason you don't like the music is because you can't dance.
Really?
In your face.
So it turned out I did get an "A" in my English mid-term and the A minus was in Math.
What a crazy week that was.
That takes us up to the spring quarter.
That's when l Worked hard, got good grades, made the honor roll, the end.
Granny!
Oh, sugar!
Will, as handsome as ever.
Grandma, as generous as ever.
Did you notice how Carlton's grown?
He's almost into adult sizes.
Congratulations, dear.
I've been looking through the guidebooks I found an attraction with your name written all over it.
- What's that, honey?
- Raging Waters.
- Are you insane?
- It's a little late to be asking.
She's here to rest and recuperate.
She's just gotten over the flu.
I told you it was a cold.
What did the doctor say?
Us country folks don't run to the doctor at every sneeze, sniffle, or broken bone.
We are not the spendthrifts you are, Zeke.
Zeke.
That one always kills me.
Granny, I love when you come to visit.
Did you bring the picture of him and the goat?
Never leave home without it.
Yes, sir, I'll be getting a frame for this one.
Hattie.
Hello!
Honey, you are younger and prettier every time I see you.
Will you look at you two?
- You could enter a beauty contest.
- Grandma.
Really?
I never gave it much thought.
Just think, for the talent portion, you could twirl a checkbook.
Grandma, are we gonna do some more crafts while you're here?
We sure are.
Geoffrey!
Yes, madam?
Ashley and I are going to be doing some art.
We're going to need 50 Popsicle sticks two bags of macaroni wheels, and lots and lots of glitter.
I'm way ahead of you.
In anticipation of your visit I have saved two dozen egg cartons.
Thank you, Geoffrey, but we won't be making purses this time.
Speaking of art, I thought we could go to the museum.
They have a display on 100-year-old quilts.
I got one of them in the back of my truck.
I know what'd be perfect for Grandma: A complete day of beauty where the salon does your hair, makeup, nails, and you come out looking fabulous.
I don't think your grandmother would be interested.
Then can I do it?
I know we all have plans for Grandma, but let her relax a little bit first.
Sweetie, I feel fine.
Maybe so, Mama, but while you're here I want you to take it easy.
You are not to lift a finger.
We're gonna treat you like a queen.
You said the magic words.
Granny, what you doing?
Nothing much, I'm afraid.
Your uncle gave me this book of find-the-word puzzles.
So I found all the words.
Now what do I do with them?
You shouldn't just be sitting here.
You should do something you like doing, like I don't know baking me a sweet potato pie.
Baby, much as I'd like to, I think your uncle wants me to stay put.
Now that's your first mistake.
He tells me all kinds of stuff to do and I never listen to him.
And I'm a better person for it.
How come you're just sitting around?
Don't you have any plans?
No, not really.
You got to have a girl.
No kidding.
There's no one that gets your sap rising?
There's this girl named Tanya, I met her at the mall.
She works in a fancy men's store where even the underwear comes from Europe.
I don't know if she'd go out with anybody in local drawers.
Sets to mind a heifer we once had.
You ain't seen Tanya.
You listen up.
Petunia had two bulls liking her.
One a big strong Angus with a chest as wide as a Chevy.
That one's me, right?
The other was a slim, handsome Jersey.
A real lady's bull.
Word to Granny.
That one's me, right?
All season long, Petunia just couldn't decide.
So come fall, she ups and picks the Angus.
See?
No.
By then, breeding season was over.
Maybe if you changed it to cats or something.
Everybody be quiet.
Grandma's probably sleeping.
She's going to love my gift.
I didn't know Leonard Nimoy even sang.
- That was very thoughtful, Carlton.
- Thank you.
I smell something funny.
It smells like pine or something.
I smell it, too.
I thinks it's coming from the kitchen.
What is that smell?
Watch your step.
The floor is wet.
Mother, what are you doing?
I'm picking apples from a cherry tree.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm giving your floor a good hand scrubbing.
- That's Geoffrey's job.
- No, it ain't.
I have begun the mulch pile, madam.
Fine Geoffrey, I'll be out to look at it directly, right after I flip the mattresses.
Hold on, Mama.
Geoffrey Sorry, sir, but she threatened me with a whupping.
It seems like you're back to your old self.
I have an idea for this afternoon.
I know how proud you are of your azaleas.
Why don't we go to the botanical gardens and see how theirs stack up?
- I'll get my sweater.
- Why?
Mama, you cold?
Geoffrey, turn up the heat.
Sir, I already set the thermostat on 80 as you requested.
The candles are starting to melt.
I just wanted my sweater because we are going to the gardens.
We can go to the garden later this week.
I want you to get settled in.
I am more settled than a big old box of raisin bran.
Mama, don't excite yourself.
Is there anything I can get for you?
- How about a magazine?
- Or a game.
Or some moisturizer.
I have an idea.
Why don't we all take a dip in the pool?
Sounds good.
That way we can all get out and let Mama take a nap.
I want to swim, too.
You shouldn't swim when getting over the flu.
We'll see you after your nap.
Nap!
Why don't they put me in a playpen?
Yo, DJ Granny.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
And your uncle aims to keep it that way.
I know he means well but a body has to feel useful.
Useful?
You know that girlie advice you gave me?
It worked like a charm.
Really?
I don't remember it exactly but I just walked up to her and said: "Hey Tanya, bulls and cows need to get together before it starts snowing".
And she understood that?
No, but she liked my hair.
We're going out on her first night off.
That's fine.
But I don't have a date for the concert tonight.
- Who's playing?
- Heavy D. I love him.
You do?
Who doesn't like Charlie Daniels?
This is another Heavy D, Granny.
Maybe if I play this tape for you.
Check it out.
Not bad.
Can't understand what he's saying but it does have a beat to it.
What kind of dance you do to this?
Trust me on this one.
It's very complicated.
It takes a lot of hard study and dedication to learn.
Honey, I ain't got that kind of time.
You're getting there, you're getting there!
This kind of dancing works up quite an appetite.
What say I make us some flapjacks?
Granny, will you marry me?
Sweet talker!
This is the good part.
I'll turn up the Victrola.
Yeah!
Go, granny!
Go, granny!
What's going on in here?
Mama, are you all right?
Of course I am.
Take your hands off of me.
Will, why were you playing that music?
Grandma's supposed to be resting.
You're grounded.
Don't get so worked up.
I was just having fun.
Mama, a woman your age should not be dancing around.
Boy, don't you tell me what to do.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to look out for you.
Will, no more horsing around.
"Will, no more horsing around".
That boy is about as much fun as day-old oatmeal.
I noticed that.
Granny, since we're both grounded want to go upstairs, slam our bedroom doors, and throw things?
A woman my age shouldn't be dancing.
We'll see about that.
Spoiling my fun.
Yours?
I can't believe I'm not going to that concert.
You are going to that concert.
- I am?
- That's right.
With me.
But Uncle Phil won't let us.
Uncle Phil won't see us.
Sneaking out?
You?
Honey, you are looking at a woman who has snuck out to more barn dances hayrides, and midnight skinny-dips than a chicken has pecks.
Yo well Hiiii haaaaa!
Looks like you've got plans for the evening.
Yeah.
Got me a couple of extra pillows.
I like to turn in early at my age.
- Would you like some hot chocolate?
- Lord, no!
Don't need the stimulation.
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.
That was close.
But I was cool.
Good work 0070.
Now here's the plan.
The concert starts at 8:00.
My friend Jazz will meet us at the corner at 7:00.
He'll flash his lights twice, then drive us to the Bel-Air border.
There, we'll meet with a guy known only as the Captain.
He'll drive us the rest of the way.
No questions asked.
What's the code words?
Here's $10.
Got you.
You're going to be ready to go?
No problem.
Good, you'll blend in.
I brought these pillows to put them in our beds so they think we're sleeping.
Granny, granny, granny Nice try, but today it's all done electronically.
Check it.
That's lovely dear What do you mean your grandmother wasn't in her room?
?
Well, i went to tell her goodnight, but there were just clothes underneath her covers.
Where on earth would she get an idea like that?
Will!
How could he still be sleeping?
Look at this.
I can't believe how low Will will stoop to deceive you.
With this tape, who knows how many times he could sneak out of the house for a whole night completely unnoticed.
- You think Will and Grandma are all right?
- I'm sure they are.
Okay, I'm going to bed.
I don't understand.
Where would they be at this hour?
The Heavy D concert.
I accidentally overheard Will on the phone when I was trying to clean my receiver.
Will probably dragged my mother with him.
- I'm going down there.
- I'm going with you.
It's a rap concert.
You want to be with someone who knows how to be hip.
$10 for a T-shirt.
That boy must be crazy.
I still ain't sure how you managed to get it for $1.25 and a picture of Grandpa.
I've been thinking.
Maybe we should call home.
I know how it is.
I've been a parent.
I've been a kid, and the answer is bad choice, Joyce.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Miss Fitzgerald?
I'm a big fan of yours.
I was wondering if i can I have your picture taken with me?
Come on, she's not Ever too busy for a fan.
They had backstage passes.
It shouldn't be too hard to find them.
Let's hurry up.
This is weird.
Can you believe how these kids dress?
It's beginning to get to me.
Excuse me a moment.
I just Could I see your backstage pass, please?
I don't have one.
I'm here looking for my mother.
And your sister knows a member of the band, right?
You groupies are all alike.
I am not a groupie.
Call it what you like, but take it from me, Heavy D doesn't want to hear you rap.
Where do you think you're going?
Pardon me.
Have you seen a kid in wild, colorful clothing with an earring in his ear and the sides of his head shaved?
Nope.
You better get to your seat, the concert's about to start.
I'm not here to see some stupid concert.
Never mind.
I'll find him myself.
He couldn't have gotten too far.
Everybody, put your hands together for Heavy D!
Boo!
When the crowd saw he wasn't Heavy D, they was upset.
Uncle Phil, you had the shortest rap career in history.
But I do feel bad.
All the trouble we caused you.
Yeah, you're right.
Me, too.
Oh, well!
You all should've seen Granny.
She was great.
She climbed down from the second story window then she ran to Jazz's car then helped push it up the hill when it stalled.
Philip, I think you're right.
I don't think Hattie's up to seeing those azaleas tomorrow.
Why, I sure am, and after that Hilary and I are going to get those facials.
Grandma, you haven't lived until you've had a mud mask.
What people don't pay for in Beverly Hills.
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.
And then, Ashley, baby you and I are going to make us some macaroni rain hats.
Great!
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night, precious.
After all that activity, you're going to need a rest.
That's when you can tell me more about your schoolwork, dear.
Excellent!
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night, baby.
You know, Granny, you were a great date tonight.
You showed me a great time.
And to thank you tomorrow I'm going to bake you a sweet potato pie.
Granny, I don't think you should be waking up all early.
Let's get started on it now.
Will, I think it's time for bed.
- Good night, Granny.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, darling.
Don't go giving me that look, Zeke.
Now, you're not all that mad with me, are you?
Well Mama, yes, I am.
I try to set some rules down for Will and you undermined my authority.
I know how to handle things.
I am an adult.
I am, too, Zeke.
- I know that.
- Do you?
How many adults do you tell to take a nap?
Mama, I was just worried about you.
But I'm fine, baby.
I know.
When you had the flu and I talked to you on the phone you sounded so small.
I just want you to live a long time.
Then, Zeke let me live.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Mr. Jazz - What up, J?
- Yo, Prince, I need a favor.
Anything, man.
How many times you helped me out?
Seven.
- What do you need?
- A date.
- Say no more!
- I want you to date my sister.
Say a lot more.
She just moved out here.
She hasn't had a date yet.
- Prince, she really needs a man.
- But does she look good?
Sure she does.
Good looks run in my family.
Okay, Jazz.
Look, you know I'd do anything for you.
- You're like a brother to me.
- Check.
Which means that your sister should be like a sister to me, not a girlfriend.
If it doesn't work out, it could jeopardize our friendship.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Look, my brother, I have to give this some serious thought.
- Can I bring her by just to meet you?
- Yeah, that's chill.
Cool.
Tonight, 8:00 sharp.
And try to smell good.
Yo, big boy.
Give your sweet mama some sugar.
Okay.
I did my budget just like you told me.
- Good for you.
Let me see.
- This is the amount I made last week.
These were my expenses.
I spent five times more than I made.
This budget thing is pretty easy.
Yo, G!
Chill, man!
Whatever you do, don't open that door.
- Please, Lord, tell me it isn't the police.
- No.
It's my boy, Jazz.
Much worse.
Hey, G. $10 says I ain't home.
It doesn't quite say it loudly enough.
- Do I hear $15?
- G, you gonna do a brother like that?
- My life's at stake.
- I took that into consideration.
- Why don't you want to see Jazz?
- It's his sister I don't want to see.
- Jazz is trying to set me up.
- Jazz has a sister?
Nice to meet you, Dad.
Mr. Jazz and Miss Janet.
Prince, here she is.
Janet, Will.
Will, Janet.
You don't have a goatee.
Excuse me?
Hi, I'm Vivian Banks, Will's aunt.
And this is my husband Philip and our daughters Hilary and Ashley.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hey, meet me again.
Why don't we all take a seat?
May I get you anything, Master William?
A dribble bib?
How long have you been in town?
I just moved here.
I got a scholarship to go to UCLA.
We certainly know who got the brains in your family.
Yeah, but Janet ain't stupid.
So, Mrs. Banks, Jazz tells me you're a college professor.
That's right.
I teach English.
And Mr. Banks, Jazz tells me you're a professional wrestler.
I'm afraid he was mistaken.
I'm a lawyer.
My apologies.
I was misquoted.
I went to UCLA.
Do you want to use my books?
Thanks.
I was thinking of buying used books.
Well, these aren't used.
- Come take a look at them anyway.
- Okay.
Jazz, I'm going to go into the kitchen for a snack.
When I come back, I want you gone.
Guess I got plenty of time then.
Will, I think Janet likes you.
I definitely think she's up on me.
You know, it's probably not too late to get that spinach out of your teeth.
So, what do you think?
Brother, do the words "boing-yoing-yoing" mean anything to you?
I can't wait to go out with your sister.
Thanks for putting me "D," man.
Man, I'm having second thoughts.
See, Prince, you're like a brother to me.
If you date my sister and it doesn't work out it could jeopardize our friendship.
I'm willing to take that risk.
In that case, how much are you willing to give?
Give?
You know, to take her out.
I'd sure look good in this jacket.
I should have known.
The hat, too.
The hat.
Let me get a good look at this shirt.
I must say Mr. Jazz's sister is quite a charmer.
Yes, she is.
Makes me question the whole theory of genetics.
Come on, Philip, it was awfully nice of Jazz to introduce Will to his sister.
He's a good friend.
My brothers and sisters, I've got a date.
- You know what would be fun?
- I can think of a couple of things.
It would be fun to take your cousin Ashley out sometime.
I love kids.
- Yeah, word.
Kids are great.
- Do you want kids of your own?
- Definitely.
- You'd be a great dad.
You, too, baby.
I probably shouldn't tell you this but the moment I saw you I knew we'd be great together.
I hope it wasn't the leather jacket that did it.
Don't be silly.
You're not wearing the jacket now, are you?
And I never will be again.
Clothes don't make the man.
And, Will, you are my man.
Oh, man.
Maybe we should look at the menu.
If I can get my eyes to focus.
I am getting a little hungry.
Baby, have the lobster, have the caviar.
Anything you want.
I know I don't want lobster and caviar, they're much too expensive.
You're right.
We are going to be great together.
- Hi, I'm Gia.
- Hi, I'm Will.
- You ready to order?
- We certainly are.
- Not.
- Then I'll come back.
William, can we get one thing straight?
When you are with me, I don't want you to be looking at other women.
- What other women?
- Please.
I saw you looking at that waitress.
So you can just put those googly eyes back in your head, all right?
Hello?
I said, all right?
All right.
Gia?
I'd like the swordfish and a salad.
No dressing.
What about you, Will?
I'll have the - I'll have the steak.
Rare.
- Steak is really unhealthy.
- Do you need another minute?
- No.
He'll have the same thing I'm having.
Plus a baked potato.
No butter, no sour cream.
- Thank you.
- Got it.
I like sour cream.
You used to.
From now on, you need to watch that cholesterol.
I'm not having my husband dying of a heart attack at 40 and leaving me to raise six kids by myself.
Six kids?
That's right, baby.
Three girls, three boys.
And don't even think about naming one of them William.
Janet, hold on.
Wait a minute.
Don't you think it's a little early to be talking about marriage?
Excuse me?
Then what did you have in mind?
I don't know.
Dinner, maybe a dance or two.
Is that right?
A moment ago, you were chewing on my earlobe, Mr. Niblet.
Did you think you could sample the milk without putting a down payment on the cow?
I ordered lemonade.
You're not gonna drink it.
You're cutting out sugar, too.
No husband of mine will sit around getting fat and watching TV all day and leaving me with all the work of raising six kids by myself.
No.
- But - But, nothing.
And look at me when I'm talking to you!
William, who are you looking at?
Don't you feel great?
Brisk walk in the morning and now you're exercised and ready to start the day.
Yeah.
We got any more of those pecan rolls?
Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I need your help.
I'm having girl problems.
- Didn't your date go well last night?
- No.
What's the matter, baby?
You like Janet more than she likes you?
I don't think so.
Well, I sure liked her.
I hope so, since we'll probably be living here with our six kids.
- Kids?
- She told me last night we're having six.
Not anytime soon, I hope.
She doesn't want to start a family until we've finished graduate school worked at least five years and have complete dental benefits.
- That sounds very sensible.
- Aunt Viv, this is all before we had salads.
Why don't you tell her you're not interested?
I tried, man.
She just won't listen.
It's like Fatal Attraction.
I'm telling you, if we had a bunny, dude would be on the stove right now.
- Come on, Will.
- I'm telling you, this babe is tripping.
She's already telling me what to do, what to eat, where to look.
Well, women get like that.
- Get like what?
- You know.
No, Philip, I do not.
Women get like what?
Like that.
You say something, William?
Master William, Mr. Jazz is here to see you.
Thank you, G. What do women get like?
I am waiting.
Hello!
Prince, is your uncle here?
I think I dislocated my hip last night dancing.
I don't want to risk getting thrown out.
Yo, man, what's up?
Come on, man, that tickles.
I want my clothes back, Jazz.
You set me up with a maniac.
Your sister's the bossiest woman in the world.
- I know.
- You know?
She gets on my last nerves.
Ever since she moved out here she's been hanging out at my place, bossing me around all the time.
I had to pawn her off on some sucker.
Between you and the Humpty Dance, I'll get a metal plate put in my butt.
You deserve it.
Your sister showed up here at 7:00 to pick out my clothes.
By 10:00, she phoned five times.
I'm telling you, she'd be here now if she wasn't out shopping for my beeper.
Are you saying your relationship isn't working out?
What relationship?
I just met her.
If you're thinking about breaking up with her, you better think again.
Last guy that tried to cut her loose it wasn't pretty.
Dude, he's walking and all, but still.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I say, marry her.
You can stop that.
Homes, I'm breaking up with her.
Well, if she kills you, can I have that shirt?
- No, you can't have this shirt, Jazz.
- I got an idea.
I set you two up to get her out of my face, right?
So why don't you set her up with some other sucker?
I ain't living like that.
What guy deserves a woman like your sister?
Hi, fellas!
Hope you don't mind, I borrowed your Public Enemy tape.
- You like Public Enemy?
- To tell you the truth, they're not half bad.
That used to be my favorite song.
You know, Carlton, I misjudged you.
You're a lot cooler than I thought.
You want to go to the club with us tonight?
Sure, but I don't have a date.
Carlton, never bring a sandwich to a buffet.
And what is boyfriend having?
The green-grass salad with blue-cheese dressing.
- Nix the blue cheese.
- Got it.
Janet!
Kiss, kiss.
- Janet, meet Toni.
Toni, Janet.
- Oh, Janet.
I have a sister named Jane, but we call her Amy.
You know Carlton and Will.
And a little further down on the evolutionary chart, Jazz.
She noticed me.
Would you ladies care to join us?
Maybe later.
We have to see if anyone better is here first.
- Isn't that Patrick Swayze?
- I don't know.
You tell us, Carlton.
You see, Janet, not only is Carlton brilliant and handsome he also knows everybody who's anybody.
- Ain't that right, Jazz?
- Does he know Janet Jackson?
William, ever since we got here you've been going on and on about Carlton this and Carlton that.
Boy, save your charm for the girl on your arm.
Someone has her rude hat on tonight.
William, my soda is warm.
Yo, Gia.
I need more ice.
You need more ice, what?
I need more ice in my warm soda.
You need more ice, please.
- What did you say to me?
- He said, "You need more ice, please".
Heads up.
Will, I'm sorry.
I've got to say something.
Janet, your behavior this evening has been completely unacceptable.
Carlton.
Where I come from, manners count for a lot.
I'm sorry I've got to say this but I simply can't sit back and allow this rudeness to continue.
You owe every one of us an apology, especially that poor waitress.
If you refuse, we're taking you home and continuing the evening without you.
Do I make myself clear?
You know, I'm going to miss him.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Carlton.
Carlton was a little bit of that.
I didn't know he had it in him.
He stood right up to Janet and said: "Baby, that's about all that lip I'm going to have".
Boys, you've got a lot to learn about women.
Carlton has obviously been watching me in action.
Now, Will, your Aunt Vivian can be quite bossy at times.
But when she starts bossing me around, I don't let it bother me.
I just say no in a strong, masculine voice.
And when I say no, she jumps.
Excuse me.
What did you say?
I don't know.
How long have you been there?
I came in on, "Your Aunt Vivian can be quite bossy sometimes".
You didn't hear the part where I said: "Boys, the rest of this statement is completely untrue".
Philip, you better sleep with one eye open.
I got her just where I want her.
You know, I've learned something from all this, Jazz.
- You know what every woman wants?
- Rib tips?
No, Jazz.
Every woman wants a man to take control.
That's what Carlton did with Janet.
If he can make it work for him, imagine what I could do.
You did an excellent job on those apology notes.
- I'll mail them right away.
- Mail them?
- I'm sorry, Carlton.
I'll hand-deliver them.
- That's better.
I'll get your coat.
I really should write a book.
Okay.
Jazz, I know how to check a woman.
Watch this.
Yo, Janet!
Peep this here, baby.
We're going out tonight.
I'm gonna choose the place.
I'm gonna eyeball any honey that I darn well please, all right.
Then I'm gonna order a steak with a big bucket of blue-cheese dressing.
Do I make myself clear?
The only thing clear about you is the space between your ears.
Why the hell didn't that work?
You got the theory right.
You just ain't got the technique.
Take notes.
Hilary!
What?
Hilary, your behavior at the club last night was completely unacceptable.
Where I come from, manners count for a lot.
Now, I'm sorry to have to say this, but I simply can't sit here and allow this rudeness to continue.
Do I make myself clear?
Jazz?
?
?
Come here
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
One hundred and sixty-three!
This whole page is wrong.
I'm sorry, Miss Ashley, but I'm trying to keep this place tidy.
Lord Fowler and his daughter Lady Penelope will be here soon.
Why are you nervous about it?
Lord Fowler gave me my first job as a full-fledged butler.
And he's one of the most important men in Britain.
Well, I wouldn't want to embarrass you.
British people have really good manners.
I used to be intimidated by the British.
I thought they were superior in taste, style, and breeding.
Then I saw Benny Hill.
Master Carlton.
First of all, I like Benny Hill.
Secondly, while Lord Fowler is here I must ask you to keep wisecracks like that to yourself.
During his stay, I want all of you children to maintain an air of quiet dignity.
Geoffrey, mon!
Do the limbo with me.
This is precisely what cannot happen when Lord Fowler arrives.
Yo, G. What's my name?
The Prince, right?
I know how to deal with royalty.
Don't worry.
I'll be at the peak of Schweppervescence.
Check it out.
You be the English dude.
Very well.
Pleased to meet you, William.
And I am honored to meet you, Lord Fowler.
Aunt Vivian.
Beautiful American woman.
What you thinking you're up to, boy?
All right.
Check it out, Aunt Viv.
Ziggy Marley's in concert next weekend and I was wondering, maybe I could use the car?
Where's the concert?
- Just around the corner.
- Where around the corner?
Nevada.
Forget it, baby.
Uncle Phil, mon!
You are generous, fair-minded, and very sexy.
You've already gotten your allowance.
For that, I am very thankful, mon.
He wants to drive to a Ziggy Marley concert in Nevada.
That's an easy one.
No.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
Why not?
Every time you take that car to a concert, something happens to it.
- Like what?
- A mysterious dent, a broken taillight a mural of Nia Peeples painted on the side.
I swear to you guys that was on the car when I got in it.
You're not responsible enough to drive to a concert in Nevada.
All right.
If in this next week I can prove to you I'm responsible, can I go?
Sounds like a low-risk proposition.
You're on.
That's Lord Fowler.
- Lord Fowler.
- Geoffrey.
And Lady Penelope.
My, you look lovely.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
And this is Mr. and Mrs. Banks.
How do you do?
Very nice to meet you.
How was your flight?
It was a bit choppy and quite long.
And of course, the food was horrid and the movie was a dreadful bore.
I wouldn't want to make that journey too often.
I should think not.
Won't you come in?
Philip, why are you talking like that?
Like what?
That ridiculous British accent.
Whenever you're around an English person, you slip right into it.
The first three months Geoffrey was here, I could barely understand you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Sir, madam, care to join us for tea?
Right-o.
Lady Penelope.
Wow, it must be great being a Lady.
Spending all your time shopping, going to lunch with your friends and just sitting around being waited on hand and foot.
I wonder what that would be like.
One can only imagine.
Actually, I go to a small convent school and the nuns work us very hard.
We scrub the floors, cook the meals and on the weekends, we do all the laundry.
What a gyp.
We're looking forward to taking you to dinner tonight.
Splendid.
Dinner will be a perfect time for me to bring you all up to date on the new bills pending before Parliament.
We've made some fascinating strides in maritime legislation.
I'll go into greater details at dinner.
Is tonight a school night?
No.
I already thought of that.
Mr. and Mrs. Banks, I hope I'm not being terribly rude but I was counting on seeing the opera tonight.
But, my dear, I don't want you going out alone in a strange city.
You'll need an escort.
An escort.
You mean a responsible escort.
A young man who could take Lady Penelope out tonight and return her home safe and sound.
The same type of young man who could be trusted to drive to a Ziggy Marley concert in Nevada.
I suppose so.
- Would you really take me, Will?
- Absolutely.
If it's all right with Uncle Phil.
Okay, Will.
You may take Lady Penelope to the opera.
Opera?
I thought she said "Oprah".
Spider-Man comics.
Watchman.
Goobers, Raisinets.
- What are you doing?
- Packing.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the opera.
Did you see what I did with my spitball straw?
Now, you just listen to me, you irresponsible vagabond.
I want you on your best behavior tonight.
No.
Let me revise that.
I want you on a normal person's best behavior.
Mr. Belvesneer.
The whole point of tonight is to prove that I'm responsible.
How hard can it be?
I'll take her to the opera, cop a few "Z's" bring her back home.
This weekend I'm with Ziggy.
Master William, I just hope you recognize the seriousness of the task at hand.
Why are you tripping?
She's just a girl.
Just a girl?
Master William if 895 members of the royal family instantly died she would be the next queen of England.
Now, where does that put me?
But the astounding thing about the Fisheries and Hatcheries Act of 1624 is hardly the bill itself, but rather its unique place in the entire 800-year history of maritime legislation.
I'll go into greater detail at the restaurant.
Does this restaurant have a bar?
If it doesn't, we'll build one.
I can't believe Geoffrey has done this to us.
This is going to be the longest night of our lives.
The only thing that'll make it better is knowing Will has to sit through an opera.
At this point, that's the only thing I have to cling to.
I don't feel so good.
Don't even try it, Ashley.
We're all in this together.
- Father, have a lovely time at dinner.
- Thank you, my dear.
- And I hope you enjoy the opera.
- I shall.
I always find the opera so uplifting.
Goodbye, Geoffrey.
Goodbye, Lady Penelope.
Master William.
Do not forget what I said to you.
Goodbye, Father dear.
I shall miss you.
I thought the old buzzard would never leave.
Will, got a smoke?
- Excuse me?
- I've been dying for a cigarette all day.
No, I don't have any cigarettes.
I don't smoke and you shouldn't either.
- It's bad for you.
- Sod off, mother superior.
Don't nobody call me a mother nothing.
And what's up with you?
Who are you, Dr. Jekyll and Patty Duke?
Don't be such a wanker.
I only put on that innocent schoolgirl routine for the old man.
Routine?
You've been lying to the Lord?
Whenever we go to the city, I tell my father that I'm dying to go to the opera knowing full well he detests it.
That way, I can hit the clubs.
I thought we'd go downtown to the Meat Hook.
The Meat Hook?
That's the roughest bar in L.A. Super.
That's what Lady Cicely told me.
Let's go.
Wait, wait.
Baby, you ain't going nowhere.
Geoffrey put me in charge of you.
So you can just shake your royal booty on up them steps.
You can't boss me around.
You're not a nun.
Hold on.
See, now, that's where you made your mistake.
See, I'm a plainclothes nun.
Yeah, that's right.
They call me Sister Sledge.
I hate you!
You've just ruined my whole night!
You've ruined everything!
Man, this babysitting thing is easy.
Lady, come back with my car!
- Yo, man.
Should I get the bouncer?
- I am the bouncer.
Follow your red queen.
Keep your eyes on the red card.
$10 will get you $20.
Who saw it?
Come on, boys, don't be shy.
$10 will get you $20.
Awfully glad you could make it.
Feel lucky?
$10 will get you $20.
- No way.
Look, we're out of here.
- Forget it.
This place is a blast.
The people here are so interesting.
Yeah.
I think I saw that guy on Unsolved Mysteries.
Look.
Lady Penelope, we are going home.
No, I'm not.
I'm mad about this song.
Dance with me, Will.
- I'm not dancing with you.
- Loosen up, homes.
Come on.
Get up and dance.
Shake your moneymaker.
Lady Penelope, I got a Ziggy Marley concert on the line.
Let's go.
You can't touch this!
Go, Lady!
Go, Lady!
Will you get down from here?
Hi, Otis.
Hey, punk.
You're dancing with my woman.
No.
You got it all wrong.
I'm not dancing with her.
I'm trying to get her to go home with me.
I'll bet you are.
Man, what are you, crazy?
Back up!
So that brings us up to 1907 which, in maritime law circles has come to be known as "The Year of the Trout".
I saw that sweater first!
Excuse me.
Lord Fowler.
Wasn't there quite a row in the House of Lords in 1912 when they repealed the Tuna Laws?
Geoffrey, that's a very long story.
It all began in 1910.
Sir, before you continue, would anyone care for anything?
A lobotomy.
Perhaps a drop of sherry, Geoffrey.
So, anyway, as I was saying I recently came upon a very interesting article on the subject 1910 brought a tuna shortage to the southern shores of Cornwall, Penzance in particular.
The vote, which should interest you, was as follows D.E. Chesterton, yea, Sir Rudolf Tetherbury Master William.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with Lady Penelope at the opera?
Opera?
G, she's never seen an opera in her life.
I'm telling you, she's been fronting the whole time.
How dare you besmirch the reputation of a British Lady.
G, the Lady is a tramp.
She stole the car, she snuck out to the roughest bar in town and then she hooked up with a human Godzilla.
Master William, are you telling me the truth?
I swear on a stack of TV Guides.
Master William, if we don't bring her home safe and sound Lord Fowler will never forgive me.
Your uncle will lose faith in me.
I'll never work again, and my career will be ruined.
Can we try to keep this in perspective here, G?
I'm not going to get to see Ziggy.
We must go to that bar and bring her back.
To the Batmobile.
Shame on Lady Penelope.
When she was a little girl I always told her there is no excuse for lying.
The Labor party Milord, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
My cousin Roddy has just been suddenly struck with malaria.
I must go to quarantine immediately.
Yo, G, this is a rough crowd.
You gotta watch what you say around here.
What do you mean, thank you?
That's the guy that Lady P. was dancing with.
- But where's Lady Penelope?
- He could be hiding her in his fist.
- I shall have to have a word with him.
- Careful, G. Not to worry.
I know how to handle his sort.
What have you done with Lady Penelope, you knuckle-dragging swine?
She's gone.
- Gone?
- Yeah.
- She broke up with me.
- Where is she?
Really, I don't know.
She said she wanted to go for a ride so I took her to the parking lot and put her on my bike.
And then I turned around to spit and the next thing I know, she took off on my Harley.
Man, I know how you feel.
We better keep looking.
Nonsense.
The man's a liar.
Tell us what you've done with Lady Penelope or I shall be forced to thrash you.
Don't press him, G. You saw what he did to Tokyo.
Don't worry, Master William.
In my youth, I was quite a Greco-Roman wrestler.
So then Churchill said to the king: "You're ugly".
To which the king replied: "And you, sir, are fat".
Or was it the other way round?
Anyhow, they went on like that for hours.
Are you sure there isn't any more sherry?
Anyway, this dispute took place at the height of the Flounder Rebellion.
- Mommy.
- God bless you, sweetheart.
- What's the matter, baby?
- I can't sleep.
Just sit around here for a little while.
I'll take you up, baby.
You're not going anywhere, woman.
- Sorry, Mommy.
I tried.
- Try again in 10 minutes.
Now, where was I?
God.
If you don't know, I have no idea.
How are we going to tell Lord Fowler we lost his daughter?
I'll break the news, Master William.
You're young.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
It's best I bear the brunt of the punishment.
You got a point there.
Good luck.
Geoffrey, how's your cousin Roddy?
I regret to tell you, I have no cousin Roddy.
Damn malaria.
No.
You don't understand.
What I'm about to tell you is very difficult to say.
Geoffrey, it's not more gambling debts, is it?
I thought we had that productive chat.
Sir, it isn't that.
It's about this evening.
And I have to accept full responsibility.
Yo, G. Hold up.
I can't let you go out like this, man.
This is all my fault.
Will, why aren't you at the opera with Lady Penelope?
All right.
Tonight, my plan was to take her to the opera and return her home safe and sound.
But Lady Penelope had other plans and it just didn't work out like that.
Hello, all.
I had a smashing time tonight.
My dear.
How was the opera?
It was the most wonderful opera I've seen.
- Why wasn't Will with you?
- But he was.
And he was the perfect escort.
But around the third act, Will was starting to fade so I told the poor dear to go on home.
He left me with more than enough cab fare.
Thank you so much, Will.
You're good.
So, what's all the fuss about?
Will made it up to the third act, which is more than I could've done.
An evening of opera.
I can't imagine anything more boring.
I can.
Geoffrey, I'm surprised at you, getting all hot and bothered just because the boy ducked out of it early.
It's nothing compared with your old exploits.
There's no need to go into that, milord.
I seem to recall a time that you were caught in the gazebo after that randy game of strip croquet.
But I've told enough stories for one evening.
No, I want to hear this one.
No.
It's late.
- Perhaps next visit.
- No.
Now.
We've earned it.
No.
I'm sorry.
That's the mark of a great storyteller.
Always leave them wanting more.
Good night, Geoffrey.
Night-night, Will.
Next time I'm in town, we'll have to go to the ballet.
Yeah.
I'm looking forward to that.
Well, Will, you certainly proved that you're responsible.
- That's right.
- You took Lady Penelope out and you brought her back without a hair out of place as promised.
Yep.
Just like I promised.
So, I guess you can use the car next weekend after all.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
Just one thing, Will, out of curiosity.
Since that explanation that Lady Penelope rattled off was obviously a complete crock, what really did happen tonight?
You should sit down.
It's going to be a long story, Uncle Phil.
No.
Never mind.
Enjoy the concert.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Are you guys just gonna watch TV all day?
Come on, Ashley, this is for school.
Our spokesmodel winner is Randy!
- Yes!
- I knew she was going to win.
I know you two haven't had dates in a while but how desperate can you get?
I know how desperate I can get.
How about you, Carlton?
Sky's the limit.
I better go lock up my Barbies.
I don't know, Carlton.
It sure has been a long time since I had a girl.
Tell me about it.
Last Friday, the school nurse started looking good to me.
Yeah, something about how them fat ankles roll over them squeaky white shoes.
Will you two get ready for dinner?
This girl is going to be here any minute.
Girl?
Kayla Samuels.
She's a scholarship student, and she has so much potential.
She just needs to be pointed in the right direction.
- What's she like?
- She's a lovely girl.
Red flag.
Yo, what's up?
Mom's speaking the secret code of mothers everywhere.
When she says, "lovely girl" that means "get out the Milk Bones".
Please.
I'm just looking out for her.
I want you and Will to make her feel welcome.
We will.
Besides, she's a darling girl with a nice personality.
I know that one.
What one?
Nice personality means she's protected by Greenpeace.
What I meant was, Kayla's a very interesting girl.
She was a National Merit Scholar, captain of her math team and president of her high school's French club.
There you have it.
We wouldn't have nothing to talk about.
I'm not that good at math and I don't speak no French.
Miss Kayla Samuels.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
So, Kayla, I understand you're from New York?
- That's right.
- I love New York.
Fifth Avenue, the Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower.
- Where abouts are you from?
- Harlem.
Is it nice?
Kayla was valedictorian of her high school.
Then we have a lot in common.
We're both honor students.
But we have more in common.
We're both attractive human beings of normal height.
- Dinner is served.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
So who's that English dude?
Geoffrey?
He's down with my posse.
He cuts a nice fade, so I keep him around.
Don't that make you large.
Will, what are you trying to do?
When you grow up, we'll have to have that little talk.
Don't make me laugh.
You won't reach first base with her.
To borrow a phrase from your street lingo she just hits you with a pretty hard disk.
The word is "diss".
I don't care whether it's diss, dat, or the other thing.
She goes to college.
She's not a girl, she's a woman.
They don't go out with high school boys.
Look, maybe not out here, but Kayla and I are both straight out the 'hood.
Where we come from age don't make no difference.
I have to say that your Shakespeare class is my favorite course this semester.
- What's your favorite play so far?
- Henry V. You know, that's surprising, because sequels tend to be a little disappointing.
Did you happen to catch Rocky V?
Anyway Henry V really deals with Shakespeare's most interesting themes.
I've always favored Romeo and Juliet which is based on the intellectual superiority of servants over those they serve.
My favorite Shakespeare play is King Lear.
The story of a strong, loving father destroyed by his children.
- Hamlet is my favorite.
- Really?
What's your favorite part?
Mother, are you kidding?
Mel Gibson in tights?
Hamlet does have some of Shakespeare's most compelling poetry.
You know, speaking of poetry do you know who is a very serious poet?
The Intelligent Hoodlum.
I just got his tape.
It's upstairs.
Dude be dropping science.
I don't think we're covering him this semester.
You're doing great, Will.
Now bring it home.
You know, I went on a school trip to see a musical based on a Shakespeare play, Kiss Me, Kate.
That was based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.
In our building in West Philly, we had a wild shrew once.
Just crawling out from under the kitchen sink.
Yo, dude was, like, this big.
Stole a Smithfield ham from my Uncle Leroy.
- I don't want to be rude.
- No, go ahead.
I was invited to my English professor's home.
I was enjoying an interesting discussion on Shakespeare.
I did not come to discuss Rocky, rap, and rodents.
If you're doing this for my benefit, I'm sorry, I think it's very juvenile.
And I'm not in high school.
Worked like a charm, Will.
Philip, have you seen my car keys?
How many times do we have to go through this?
Let's retrace your steps.
When did you last have them?
- Last night.
- Okay.
When last night?
When I said, "Yes, Philip, you can borrow my car keys".
Daddy, if you're always losing your keys, you should use my system.
What's that?
I was always losing my car keys so I went down to the key store and had 30 copies made.
That way when I lose a key, I always have another one.
And next month, I do the same thing.
That's your system?
Absolutely.
I did the same thing with our house key.
You mean, there are copies of our house key all over Los Angeles?
Don't worry, Daddy.
I put our name and address on all of them.
Come on.
We got to find those car keys.
Kayla's coming any minute.
I promised her I'll take her to a poetry reading at USC and I don't wanna be late.
No, hold on.
Wait.
Kayla's coming over here?
I'm out of here.
I don't even want to hear that girl's name.
- Fine.
We don't have to talk about her.
- Good.
You know what my beef with Kayla is?
I thought you didn't want to talk about Kayla?
There's Kayla.
Great.
This is great.
I'm out of here.
I'm leaving.
Miss Kayla Samuels.
We'll leave as soon as we find the car keys.
Maybe we should just drive around town and look for Hilary's keys.
- Kayla.
- Yes.
I just want to apologize for my behavior at dinner the other night.
I was kidding around, and I took it a little too far.
That's okay.
I just have one question.
I hope it's not too personal or anything.
What is it?
Have you always been this stuck-up or did it take years of practice?
You calling me stuck-up?
You the one that's stuck-up.
- Me?
- That's right, my brother walking around fronting like you all that.
Excuse me, Miss Madam.
But you're the one fronting like you all that when in actuality, you're about that much of that.
You so stuck-up your fingers got to make an appointment to scratch your damn head.
- Your mama.
- What about my mama?
Your mama's so fat, they showed her a picture of her feet and she couldn't identify them.
Okay.
You know what?
Your mama's so dumb she went to the movies.
It said, "Under 17 not admitted" so she went and got 16 of her friends.
I shouldn't be talking about your mama.
I feel sorry for your mama having such an ugly child.
Say what?
You're so ugly, she tied a pork chop around your neck just so the dog would play with you.
You so ugly your mama had to feed you with a slingshot.
You so ugly, that ain't a fade on your head that's your hair running away from your face.
You so ugly This is a good one.
You are so ugly that if you Damn, baby.
You so fine.
I would kiss you but I just had a chilidog.
Happy two-week anniversary, Olive Oyl.
Thank you, Popeye.
These are really pretty.
You shouldn't have.
Yeah, that's what my neighbor's gardener said.
Man, look like you been studying with the hardness.
You ever filled your head with so much information you felt like it was gonna bust?
No.
But I once got up to the third level of Super Mario Bros and, yo, it was hectic up there.
I have a lot more reading to do.
That's cool.
Go ahead.
I got some stuff to do anyway.
- Will, I'm studying.
- So am I. Damn, I'm almost ready for the test.
Come on, honey.
I got a big Shakespeare exam coming up.
All right.
Let me help you out.
Okay.
All right.
Read me a passage from this book and I'll try to identify the play.
All right.
You can't cheat.
- I'll move back.
- Here we go.
You are never gonna get this one.
"Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo"?
Here we go.
"The weight of this sad time we must obey "Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say".
That is Albany, Act V, Scene III, King Lear.
Damn, you're good.
Not really.
These children been studying Shakespeare since the ninth grade.
I'm just catching up.
Come on, baby.
Stop tripping.
Look, you the smartest girl I ever known.
When you start using them million dollar words makes my liver quiver.
Thank you, Will.
You're the only boy I've ever been with that really appreciates my being sesquipedalian.
Meow, baby.
Hi, Kayla, hi, Will.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
But I probably am Anyhow, I just wanted to pick up my checkbook.
I have to buy a new outfit for the frat party on Saturday.
- Who's throwing a party?
- The guys of Sigma Sigma Gamma.
There's gonna be a really cool band and everyone is going to be there.
Come on, baby.
That sounds dope.
Let's go.
I don't feel like it.
Okay.
Bye.
How come you didn't want to go?
I've been to one of those parties.
It's like being on the moon or something.
I had nobody to talk to and I just left after 10 minutes.
That's all right.
Here, come on.
We can go to a party at my fraternity.
Your fraternity?
Yeah, Sigma Fly.
That's right, my dear.
I'll be round your place at 8:00.
Wear something daring.
Surprise me.
I'm in a dangerous mood.
I thought we'd light a fire, put on a Tom Jones album and after a cognac or two test the waters of adventure.
Did you know, my dear, I'm an excellent photographer?
I hope you're not camera-shy.
What?
So the draperies will be ready Thursday?
Goodbye.
So, Will, dating an older woman.
I'm so proud of you.
This is just like Cher and that bagel boy.
When you've got a fantastic woman at your side, you feel like a million bucks.
I've got a splitting headache.
You know, when I have a headache Kayla breaks out the baby oil and gives me a strong back rub.
- Then right after that - I don't want to hear about this.
- I'm going to school.
- It doesn't start for an hour.
I know, but sometimes there's a girls' volleyball game in the gym and they wear those little shorts That's really pitiful, isn't it?
Miss Kayla Samuels.
- Prince.
- Hola, princesa.
- You look so good.
- Yeah, I know.
- Kayla.
- Hi, Professor Banks.
- You weren't in class yesterday.
- I had cramps.
I'm really sorry.
I've been so busy lately.
But I will be there next time.
So, will I see you tonight at the English department party?
Yes.
I'll be there.
Later, baby.
Kayla's been spending a lot of time with you.
You know, Aunt Viv I'm sort of like a big old bag of Lay's potato chips.
It's like, once you get a taste, you just can't stop.
You're certainly like a big old bag of something.
Honey, listen to me.
I just read Kayla's Shakespeare exam.
It's way below her usual work.
I'm gonna have to give her a "D", and that kills me.
A "D"?
Come on.
She's real smart.
But she still has to do the work, which she hasn't been doing lately.
That's just one bad grade.
It ain't the end the world.
When your grades slip, we ground you and we make sure you get back on track.
If Kayla slips, she loses her scholarship and she doesn't get another chance.
What do you want me to do?
Let her have some time alone for her schoolwork.
Yeah.
This is great.
I've been here all these months chasing chicken-headed girls around and I finally find a girl that I really like and you are telling me I gotta leave her alone?
I know Kayla's special but if you care that much about her, you have to be responsible.
Do what's best for her.
Maybe being with me is best for her.
I make her happy.
You know she wasn't fitting in at that place.
I know you wanna make her happy, but this is about her life.
This might be the difference between Dr. Kayla Samuels who runs the hospital or just Kayla who cleans it.
- You thirsty?
- Yeah.
That's Dr. Kramer.
He's one of my professors.
I believe Chaucer said it best: "Let every fellow tell his tale about "And let's see now who shall the supper win.
" And I thought Carlton's come-on lines were funky.
- Hello, Will, Kayla.
- Hi, Professor Banks.
Kayla, don't feel obligated to stay at this party.
It's strictly optional.
So if you have work to do, it's all right to leave.
Yeah, I know.
I was just taking a little break.
Fine.
See you later.
Maybe it ain't such a bad idea to go back to your room.
I guess this is kind of wack.
We can have a little party in my room 'cause I don't have classes till Wednesday.
I was thinking maybe you should go by yourself.
Excuse me?
We've been seeing each other every minute.
I thought we just need a little time apart.
Apart?
What are you trying to say?
Did you come to break up with me?
No.
Look I just think you need more time to concentrate on your studying.
That is weak.
- You got a "D" on your last exam.
- Did your auntie tell you that?
Did your auntie tell the whole world I got one bad grade?
Kayla, you have a big opportunity here.
I don't wanna have no part of you blowing it.
Yes, it's my big opportunity.
That's what everybody keeps telling me.
I do not need to hear it from you.
The answer is "C".
I'm not sure what you're studying but I know that with multiple-choice you can't go wrong with "C".
Come on, Kayla.
I know I didn't say all right things at the party What are you trying to say?
You want me to study, I'm studying.
What are you doing here?
I just wish everybody would leave me alone.
Can I come in?
I guess that won't be happening tonight.
Kayla, don't be so angry with Will.
I told him that I didn't think you two should spend so much time together.
You did what?
You're not my legal guardian.
How would you feel if someone interfered with your life?
Just face it, Professor you fit in here.
I don't.
- I think I should go.
- Will, I want you to stay.
Look, I didn't always fit in.
Let me tell you both Let me tell you something.
I got four older sisters, all of them mamas before they were 18.
None of them finished high school.
Everybody's waiting for Kayla.
I'm the last chance for the whole damn family and you have no idea what that feels like.
I know what that feels like.
I know what it feels like to clean hotel rooms during the day and go to school at night to get the high school diploma I didn't get.
You dropped out of high school?
It's not something I'm proud of, but I did it.
My whole family was counting on me, too but I couldn't handle the pressure so ran off with some guy and quit school.
By the time I realized I'd made a mistake, it was too late.
I was left with no education and nothing I was qualified to do.
It took me years to get back.
If you wonder why I seem to fit so well here it's because I worked damn hard to get here and I know I deserve it.
Your problem is that you don't know you deserve it.
Will knows it and I know it but unless you know it there is nothing more I can say.
See you at home, Will.
Man I didn't know Aunt Viv cleaned hotel rooms.
Wonder how come she never cleaned my room.
You all right, babe?
It's scary here.
Come on.
You're going to make it.
Look, I'm telling you.
If there's anything I can do or not do, I will do or not do.
That sounds good.
I got three weeks of goofing off to make up for so I'm gonna hit the books.
Yeah.
I'll stay out of your way.
We both have a new leaf to turn over, huh?
Yeah, you're right.
- I'll call you?
- Okay.
Later, baby.
Later.
Out!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Here are my car keys.
Ashley has a birthday party to go to on Saturday afternoon.
And Carlton may use the car to go to glee club practice.
And Master William?
He's not allowed to use the car again until August of 1992.
Very well, madam.
Everybody, I'm going.
Excuse me, Mother, but I am very, very offended.
What is it this time, Hilary?
I've started recycling.
That's not it.
Instead of making Geoffrey work on the weekend you should leave the running of this household to me.
I am 21 years old.
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't think you'd want to run the household.
I've got to learn sometime.
After all, in a couple of years, I'm going to have my own family and my own butler.
I hope it's no one I know.
- Ready to go, sweetheart?
- All set.
If you had to pick a weekend to go away, you picked a good one.
I'll be at the office working most of the time anyway.
If you have a lot of work to do, why don't you just do it here?
That's why.
How y'all doing?
I just got my hair cut.
Kind of fly, huh?
I don't understand why you get your hair cut like that.
All the brothers in Philly play their hair like this hair on top, none on the sides.
But, I guess y'all got kind of a reverse thing going on here.
- Will, I'm leaving.
- You're leaving?
Finally.
I always thought you could do better.
Good luck.
Will, I'm going to Berkeley to give my lecture.
- You are?
When you coming back?
- Tomorrow night.
While I'm gone I want you to do everything your Uncle Philip says.
Aunt Viv, wait.
Don't leave me here.
Don't leave me here with him!
He's going to eat me.
Don't leave me here.
Michelle, we're in luck.
My mom's away for the weekend, our butler's off duty and my dad will be leaving for the office at any minute.
And I just took a multivitamin.
I really like this room, Carlton.
You'll like it more in a minute.
Michelle, I just wanted to say I think you're the most talented member on the swimnastics team.
I can hold my breath for long periods of time.
Good.
We're going under.
Hello.
Rice Krispie Treats?
What are you doing?
Mom left me in charge, so I have to be responsible for all the children.
We were in the middle of something.
Come on, kids, let's have a little talk.
Carlton, Michelle.
I can remember what it was like to be your age.
Your bodies are going through a lot of changes now and you're probably having a lot of feelings that you've never had before.
But even though there's a lot of pressure from your peers remember, you don't have to pet to be popular.
Let's go to the mall.
And who exactly is going to be at this mall?
Hold on, Uncle Phil, I promise I'll take good care of the car.
Give me that.
I'll trade you for the car keys.
Will, I have a lot of work to do, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet.
I don't want you taking our car downtown to some pool hall.
You can't do this to me!
Aunt Viv!
She's gone.
That's right, Will.
No one can hear you scream.
Come on.
Just 'cause you don't like pool halls doesn't mean I shouldn't go.
You're just trying to make sure I don't have any fun.
Your only source of pleasure is making me unhappy.
That's not true.
I have my wine collection.
Hold up.
You wasn't listening.
Your uncle ain't say you couldn't go to the pool hall.
He said he ain't want you to go to the pool hall.
It's a difference.
What are you, ignorant?
Pick up the damn keys.
And next time you come in here, I'm going to use this.
And stay out!
- I had your back.
- So what do you want?
- To be your friend.
- Dream on.
Then I'll take a table.
You're in luck.
Table seven over here is vacant.
Fred, get up!
I can't get no sleep around here today to save my life.
All right, young man.
I only have three rules: No spitting, no fighting, and use coasters.
- All right, who wants some?
- I'll play.
Step right up, my man.
You can break.
Want to put a little money on it to make it interesting?
No, my man, just playing for fun.
What the hey.
Maybe just $5 a ball.
- Who wants some?
- I do.
So you want to play me, my brother?
Since you done beat all the suckers at this table maybe you'd like to try your luck over here with the big boys.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
My game is all that.
All right then, 20 a ball is what we shoot.
Wait a minute.
What, $20 a ball?
You in the big leagues now, boy.
What's wrong?
No confidence in your game?
- No, that ain't it.
- Then what is it?
You look like the king of the hill around here.
You can take him, kid.
Give him some, Will.
I really wouldn't want to do what I know I can do if you know what I mean.
No, I don't know what you mean.
- Why don't you tell me?
- I know what he means.
You do?
It don't take a genius to understand the boy.
He say in plain English that he didn't want to embarrass your ugly behind up here in front of these girls.
I didn't He also said that if it weren't for the fact that he had won so much from that fool over there, he'd take your money, too.
Thank you very much for clearing that up for us, Fred.
All right then, my brother, rack them.
Well, my brother Iooks like you owe me a nice little piece of change like 500 big ones.
- $500?
- And 10% for his manager.
Wait.
Y'all hustled me.
Hustled is such an ugly word.
I prefer to think of it as creative money management.
- Now hand it over.
- All I got is $200.
No, that ain't all you got.
I seem to recall you driving up here in a Benz.
Hold it, wait.
That car ain't even mine.
You are so right, my brother.
It's mine.
Hi, sweetie, where are you going?
Kimberly's mom is picking me up.
I'm going to the party.
What kind of party?
Sarah's birthday party.
Mom told you about it.
And who's going to be there?
- Courtney, Priscilla, Maggie, David, Josh - Wait.
Let's just hold it right there with David and Josh, young lady.
I was not informed that there would be boys at this party.
I really don't like the sound of this.
All my friends are going to be there.
And if all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do it, too?
- That's my ride.
Bye.
- And no running in the house.
You'll put your eye out.
- Hilary, I'm in big trouble.
I need your help.
- What's wrong?
- I just need $300.
- $300?
What for?
Hey, young blood.
Man!
Y'all sure got it going on up in here.
- Will, who is he?
- He's from the pool hall.
I just lost a couple games and I need $300.
You blew $300 and you don't even have a sweater to show for it.
Will, I was put in charge of you.
When Mom finds out, she's gonna kill me.
She won't find out if you just get me the money.
Okay, just let me go look.
My man, Fred.
Tell you what have a seat here, I'll see if I can borrow that money from my butler.
That's what I always do.
Cocktails!
Who the hell are you?
My name is Fred Lomax, Jr. And I presume you're Will's butler.
So you can fix me a Rob Roy with a Sidecar.
You're one of Will's friends.
- Yeah.
- Get out.
Man, it is hard to find good help these days.
Mr. Lomax, I'm not the butler but I'd be most happy to show you the door.
That's mighty kind of you, big daddy but I can't go back to that pool hall without that $300.
$300?
Uncle Phil.
I see you've met my Earth Science teacher.
That's right.
He was not exactly hospitable so I'm leaving.
But if you ever want to see that car again you better come up with that $300.
You went to the pool hall and lost the car?
Uncle Phil, I'm sorry.
I know you told me that I shouldn't go.
They hustled me.
They're holding the car until I pay them their money.
- Uncle Phil, I'm really - Stupid?
I know that, Will.
I'll deal with you later.
We got to get that car back.
Uncle Phil, you can't go down there by yourself.
You can't handle those dudes.
They got guys in there that make you look like Webster.
If there are hooligans there, I should accompany you.
In the early '80s, I was sparring butler for Mr. Chuck Norris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Absolutely.
This is strictly a legal matter between me and the management.
You're back.
You better have that money.
Well!
Hello, handsome.
Madam, our car has been illegally impounded in this establishment.
And if it's not returned immediately I will be forced to take serious legal action and have your license revoked.
That's where we got you fooled.
We ain't got no license.
Uncle Phil, I don't think all this legal stuff is going to work.
The only legal phrase these people know is, "Will the defendant please rise".
Will, who's the guy who beat you?
That dude right there.
All right, pal.
I'm here to get the car.
Seems to me there's a small matter of $300, pal.
I'm not giving you one cent.
All right.
You want to wipe out the debt?
You can play for it.
$20 a ball.
Uncle Phil, don't fall for it.
That's exactly how they got me.
Will, I'm not an idiot.
I'm not about to bet on some game I've never played in my entire life.
What's the matter, buddy.
Aren't you man enough?
What did you say to me?
Seems to me that you don't want to play because you can't play.
Can't play?
You put the balls into the hole.
How difficult can that be?
I've seen it on TV.
That's right.
All you got to do is put the balls in the hole, just like on TV.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let you break.
Geoffrey, get me one of those stick thingies.
At least he's got the terminology down.
Sir, do you think this is wise?
Don't be ridiculous, Geoffrey.
It's simple geometry.
That was just a practice shot.
Looks like it's my turn.
Now you owe me $400.
Uncle Phil, can you just pay him and let's go?
No, I think I'm getting a lot better, don't you?
Much better.
That's not how I see it.
You still stink.
I wouldn't talk.
Wait a minute.
Let's play another game.
I want another chance.
Uncle Phil!
I don't know.
My time is very valuable.
I couldn't possibly play another game without upping the ante.
How much?
Let's say, a nice, round figure like $100 a ball.
$100 a ball?
That's right, Uncle Phil.
Okay.
$100 a ball.
You got yourself a game.
Geoffrey?
Break out Lucille.
$600, $700 $800, $900.
And 10% for his manager.
Oh, it's gonna be like that, my brother after you done had me up in your house.
Let this be a lesson to you.
Don't mess with my boy again.
You mess with him, you're messing with me.
Yeah!
- Hi, Hilary.
- Mother, you're back.
How was your trip?
Fine.
How was your weekend with the kids?
- It went great.
- Really?
I've got to tell you, even though I wanted to do this deep down I had a lot of anxiety about taking on this kind of responsibility.
Now that I've been through it, I can honestly say I handled it, I prevailed and now I think I'm ready to have children of my own.
That's great, Hilary.
So, where are the kids?
What, you mean like now?
- Mom!
- Mommy!
- Thank God you're home!
- What's the matter?
- Hilary was a tyrant all weekend.
- She was terrible.
Next time you go out of town, I beg of you, please just put food and water in a dish.
Someday you'll have children of your own, and then you'll understand.
- Baby.
- Hi.
- How was your lecture?
- They loved it.
How was your weekend?
Fine.
I got a lot of work done.
Finished up a little early tonight so Will and I had a chance to spend some time together.
We had fun.
You two got along?
It figures you'd choose the weekend I was away.
I'm exhausted and I am going to bed.
- Good night.
- Night, Aunt Viv.
I'll be up in a minute, sweetheart.
How come you didn't tell her what really happened?
Because I don't want her to worry about it.
It's between you and me.
Do you think she'll put two and two together when the cops dig my body up.
Don't give me any ideas, Will.
I just have one question.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Is that like a rhetorical question?
You know, a hard head makes for a soft behind.
What, you're going to spank me?
You know the severity of what you did tonight.
We're going to discuss your punishment tomorrow.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
And, Uncle Phil?
I just wanted to say thanks for coming to the pool hall and saving my butt tonight.
I ain't seen too many people shoot like that.
Where did you learn?
Let's just say, I've spent time in a pool hall or two in my life.
I know what goes on there.
Which is why I don't want you going down there in the first place.
You think I want to spoil your fun?
I just want you to come home in one piece.
That's decent.
I also want to thank you for winning my money back.
Your money?
I'll play you for it.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Let's take five, guys.
Will, was that really necessary?
I'm sorry, Carlton.
You thought I was laughing at you?
That's what it sounded like.
No.
See, when I laugh at you, it's more like this Just for future reference.
Man, y'all butchered that song.
Hey, C, I'm telling you, if the Commodores heard you singing they'd tie you down to the tracks and run you over with the soul train.
I can understand why you're threatened.
After all, you two possess absolutely no musical ability.
Face it, you're so jealous, you're green.
All right, but just out of curiosity, Carlton, what color are you?
Here we go again.
Just because I grew up in the best neighborhoods and pronounce the "i-n-g"s at the end of my words doesn't make me any less black than you.
No.
It's that tie that does it.
Face it, C, I'm telling you.
If you went down to Jazz's neighborhood Iooking the way you look and talking the way you talk you wouldn't come home walking the way you walk.
- And what neighborhood is that?
- Compton.
And if you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere.
I'd do just fine and dandy in Compton, thank you very much.
You know, C, talk is cheap.
What do you say to a bet?
Name it.
I'll bet you you wouldn't last a day in Compton.
All right.
And if I do, you have to stop making those cheap shots at me.
I don't know.
That's my whole reason for living.
- Better make it two days.
- Two days?
Piece of cake.
And I guarantee, when I get to Compton, I'll fit right in.
Damn!
Why didn't we bet money?
Hello, everybody.
It looks like the working girl is poised for a promotion.
What's up?
I sold my first picture at the art gallery.
I think I'm going to get a raise.
Excellent, Miss Hilary.
You must let me know what that feels like.
If you wanna go to Compton, you gotta go through with this.
But I've never lied to my parents.
It even gave me the willies when Beaver used to do it.
Fine.
The bet's off, then.
Man, it's about to be Diss-fest '91 around here.
And I feel one coming on now.
All right, I'll do it.
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, guys.
Hi, Mom.
Dad, did you sign our permission slips yet?
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
Two weeks ago, when Will and I gave you a permission slip for our field trip this weekend.
You said you'd think about it and sign it later.
It doesn't ring a bell.
Dad, you're always saying how important these opportunities are.
And when they come up, you completely ignore them.
It's like you don't even care.
I remember.
Where are you going, baby?
Mr. Fellows is taking the class to San Francisco to visit Mark Twain's house, and all the literary sites.
I don't know.
I thought it was important.
Philip, how could you forget something like that?
I didn't forget, Vivian.
Now, where did I put those permission slips?
Dad, don't bother looking.
I found it in the trash can, underneath a banana.
Honestly, forgetting your son and nephew like that Here you are, guys.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
I mean, really, Philip, I think you ought to review your priorities.
I'm going straight to hell.
Well, here we are, C. Jazz's crib.
Crib: house, dwelling, domicile.
How did you know that?
Hip-hop flash cards?
I made them myself.
I've been cramming all night.
I just hope I can get it out of my head before I take the SATs.
- Yo, J. - Prince.
Hi, roomie.
That's called leaving me hanging because my hand is literally left hanging in the air.
My brothers.
I want you to meet Boomps, Vidal and Tiny.
My cousin Carlton.
What was that all about?
Where do I put my things?
Let me have my butler get them.
Sorry.
I crack myself up.
You can put them on the floor, but watch out for my carpet 'cause it's imported from Persia.
I could do this all day.
Just take them to the bedroom.
Now that Carlton's unpacked, I could go for grub.
What do I do till you guys get back?
Well, let's see.
Chill.
What's up?
Don't mind me.
I'm just here on a bet.
Just give me some time to acclimate myself.
Applegate?
That sounds like a school word.
I don't like school words.
I can't applegate myself to them.
- That's very funny.
- It ain't supposed to be.
- Sorry.
- I don't like you.
That's kind of a snap decision, isn't it?
You've hardly had time to form an opinion.
That's real mature.
Everybody, put your hands in the air!
What was that all about?
Yo, fellas.
Brother, want to buy a Gucci bag?
My sister already has about eight of them.
- $20.
- I'm really not - $2.
- I don't really need - 50 cents.
- What are you talking about?
Maybe it is.
Maybe it ain't.
All right, look, homey.
You're never going to sell bags that way.
Maybe if you went out and bought a well-tailored suit and lost the earring, then you'd look like a real salesman.
And that grammar What?
Are you trying to suggest that I don't know how to run my business?
I don't know, Jazz.
I just feel bad for Carlton, man.
What does he know about living in the 'hood?
I spent half the ride trying to convince him not to say, "Dyn-o-mite".
I just feel like I'm tossing him to the lions.
You know what I mean?
The Detroit Lions still got those cheerleaders?
Open the door, man.
Yes, that's right.
You can buy property for no money down.
Yo, what's up?
Carlton, what the hell are you wearing?
Yo, this?
Carlton, you look like a pirate.
Yo, stop fronting.
You know this gear is chill.
Why are you talking like that?
Yo, how you playing me, Prince?
- What?
- Yo, you dissing me.
Come on, man, stop it.
Hey, Prince, lay off of him, man.
We like C-note.
C-note?
Yeah.
He was a little stiff, but he's coming around.
Yeah.
He's helping us with our business.
Hey, C-note, how do I figure my net worth?
Yo, how many times do I gotta tell you?
Write your questions down.
I'll hook you up later.
I'm sorry.
That was rude of me, man.
Yo, we cool.
They love me.
Jazz, tell me that this isn't happening.
I don't know, Prince.
I'm starting to like him, too.
Yo, C, I want to thank you for that tip.
I'm going to get me some of them douche marks.
That's deutsche marks.
Yo, check it out, C. I'm leaving, right?
I'll get back with you later so you can help me open that Schwab account.
Peace.
C-note, are you still coming to MacArthur Park tomorrow night?
Yo, I'm with it.
You're going to MacArthur Park at night?
Yeah.
My squad's going to sell some Gucci bags.
It's a sales bonanza.
Sorry.
There's no hip-hop word for sales bonanza.
C, I don't go to MacArthur Park.
What's up, Will?
Not man enough to swing with the brothers?
Get over here, man.
You have no idea what MacArthur Park is like.
It's dangerous, man.
If there's any danger, I'll call the park rangers.
It's not that kind of park, Boo Boo.
Listen, people get killed there.
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
I know exactly what I'm getting myself into.
I'm tired of you always talking down to me.
I'll win our bet.
And you'll never be able to make fun of me again.
You know what?
The bet is off.
Come on, let's go home.
Hey, leave C-note alone, man.
He ain't leaving till he does my taxes.
Yo.
I'm gonna sleep on the floor.
When are Carlton and Will coming home?
They should be here any minute.
These two days have just flown right by.
Geoffrey, did you really enjoy having Will out of the house that much?
The closest I'll ever get to a bonus.
Yo, my squad, what's up?
- Carlton?
- What happened to you?
Weren't you on your school trip?
I'm quitting school.
That's for suckers.
I'm starting my own business.
- I can get $20 for this china dog.
- No, you won't.
$2.
Who's responsible for this?
Listen, I can explain.
Daddy.
Stop it!
This is the police!
Carlton, come out with your hands up.
You'll never take me alive.
- Is Hilary ready yet?
- Would you like me to go get her?
Could you?
I don't know what takes her so long we're never this late for church.
Has anybody seen Geoffrey this morning?
- No.
Why?
- Just wondering where he is.
Philip, his weekends are his own.
It's none of our business where he goes.
Madam.
I assumed you'd be in church by now.
Maybe you'd care to join us.
On reflection, perhaps I should.
I'm ready to go, but we can't drive too fast because things haven't set yet.
If we hurry, we'll get there before the service starts - but we'll have to sit toward the back.
- The back row?
The light is completely different there.
I have to change.
Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv, I'm glad I caught you.
- Why aren't you in San Francisco?
- Where's Carlton?
Before I tell you that, Uncle Phil, I just want to Where's Carlton?
In Compton.
What is he doing in Compton?
A very bad imitation of me.
What?
Look, he just started tripping, Aunt Viv.
See, we had this bet that he couldn't hang out in the 'hood.
He's just taking it too far.
He's going to MacArthur Park tonight to sell Korean Gucci bags.
- MacArthur Park?
- Where is he right now?
He's down at Jazz's crib.
I am going down there and I am bringing my baby back.
Vivian.
Calm down.
Now, nobody's going anywhere.
Except Will.
Will?
That's me.
Where am I going?
You're going down to Jazz's and you're bringing Carlton back here by the time we're back from church.
- See, I can't exactly do that, Uncle Phil.
- Why not?
It's just the way things work down in the 'hood.
If a brother comes between a brother and his brothers then that brother's considered a mother.
I'll tell you who's a mother: Me.
And I am going there and I am bringing my baby back.
Vivian.
Put your earrings back on.
I don't care how this makes you look to your friends.
I'm tired of bailing you out.
Why should I always be the heavy?
No.
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
Vivian Carlton!
Grab a seat, man.
Dude's about to explain variable rate mortgages.
- Later.
You gotta come home.
- I'm not leaving.
Listen man I called Aunt Viv to tell her how we was doing in San Francisco she gave me some bad news, man.
Geoffrey fell down the back steps, split his wig.
We gotta go to the hospital.
Knock it off, Will.
I'm not lying, man.
The whole family's down at the hospital.
Do what you want.
I'm going down there.
- You're serious?
- Yes.
C-note, you better go, man.
Yeah.
Later.
My condolences.
Great.
Let's go.
- Carlton.
- Mom.
Aunt Viv, what are you doing here?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
I came to get my boy.
Mom, I can explain.
We were on our way to San Francisco when I realized I had a Sociology report to do Don't even try, Carlton.
Will told me everything.
It was a bet.
A bet?
I don't care.
You are not going to MacArthur Park tonight.
In fact, none of you are going to MacArthur Park tonight.
Wait a minute.
- Boy, do not test me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Carlton, Will, get your things.
I will be waiting downstairs in the car.
And another thing, this place is a disgrace.
You have a trashcan, honey.
Use it.
You went home and told Mom and Dad?
You dimed him out.
I did the right thing.
Carlton was acting irresponsibly.
Carlton was acting in what?
In Cosby?
Prince used a school word.
You 5-0'd your own cousin.
- Man, you're getting soft.
- Sellout.
Man, you're about to catch an eye jammy.
You're getting a little pale on us, ain't you?
- My brother, you wanna take this outside?
- Yo, Prince, chill out.
I can't let him say that stuff about me, man.
Maybe now you know what it feels like.
What's it like to be in this much trouble?
Why don't you ask Will.
He's been there before.
Well, they're going to do all the talking anyway so you just pretty much nod and say, "I'm sorry".
And cry if you can.
Have Mom and Dad talked to you yet?
No, but I think I heard Uncle Phil upstairs testing his belts out.
Look, guys, I know you're worried but earlier I was upstairs with Mom and Dad and even though they were initially upset now I really think they'll overlook the whole thing.
Really?
What, are you kidding?
They're going to kill you guys.
All right, guys.
Stand up.
Okay, this is new.
The only way we're going to make it is if we stick together.
Explain.
It's all Carlton's fault.
Will started it.
- You got there and started tripping.
- You were the one who made the bet.
- It was your idea in the first place.
- You're the one Hold it.
I am ashamed of you two.
Not only did you lie to us but you put yourselves in danger for a stupid bet.
But, Mom, we were never in any real danger.
Well, you are now.
Uncle Phil, at this juncture, I just want to ask is one of us in any more trouble than the other?
Will, you were the one who started this whole thing.
- I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
- "I'm sorry"?
How many times are we going to hear that?
When will you start taking responsibility for your actions?
When are you going to grow up, boy?
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
Will, sit down.
None of this would have happened if you hadn't insisted on making fun of your cousin.
For a person who's always going around saying "I wish people would let me act the way I want" you're awfully hard on Carlton.
- That was my point.
- That's no excuse.
Just because Will teases you, you have to do something this foolish?
I know it seemed foolish but I had to show him I had the courage to survive down there.
That's not courage.
Courage is being the way you are, no matter what anybody says about you.
Will teases me but you don't see me going, "Yo, yo, yo, homey, yo".
There's no "yo" at the end of it.
I'm pretty sure of it.
I'm glad you two had such a fun time down in the 'hood.
Because we're going to have a fun time dreaming up your punishment.
Peace out.
I'm gonna go test the lock on my door.
Good night, Carlton.
What do you mean, "Good night"?
This is my time to gloat.
- Gloat?
- I won the bet.
I humiliated you in front of your peers.
Plus, you said I couldn't handle Compton, and I did.
I'd say it's time to gloat.
Good night, Carlton.
You're just embarrassed because I beat you at your own game.
I never judge you for being the way you are but you always act like I don't measure up to some rule of blackness that you carry around.
Hold it.
Wait a minute.
You don't judge me?
You do everything but carry a big old gavel around.
You treat me like some kind of idiot just 'cause I talk different.
Differently.
Good night, Carlton.
Just so I don't need to tell you later I did win the bet.
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.
Our bet was you couldn't spend the weekend in Compton and you didn't.
That's because you came and got me.
If I hadn't, you'd have gotten yourself killed.
And why was that important to you?
It wasn't.
Yes, it was.
Admit it, Will.
You care about me.
I do not.
Yes, you do.
You like me.
You like having me around.
Carlton, take it back, man.
Face it.
You've just got to face it.
You love me.
My brother, you wanna take this outside?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Philip, this kitchen is a mess.
I'd appreciate some help, please.
I'm cleaning out the refrigerator.
Check it out.
I got the perfect thing to surprise Ashley with at her birthday party.
Yo, Geoffrey!
Come on down!
I'd really rather not, Master William.
Come on, G, they waiting.
Come on, G, kick it.
Hi, kids.
How are you doodly-do doing?
I have never been more humiliated in my life.
I'm sorry, but we're not laughing at you.
We're laughing with you.
Yo, that's just them.
I'm definitely laughing at you.
Master William, you could have at least rented a proper clown costume.
- There's a nasty little stain on my shirt.
- There ain't no stain Right there.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.
Hi, almost-birthday girl.
Well, sweetie, how does it feel to be almost 12?
Dad, as you get older, birthdays have less and less significance.
You know, I really stopped counting at 10.
Come on, aren't you just a little bit excited about your birthday party?
I know it's a little immature, but, yes, I can't wait.
What will you wish for when you blow your candles out?
There is one thing I've been wishing for.
- A doll?
- A dress?
- A game?
- No.
A boy!
Look.
This is a really good picture of him.
- Who's he?
- His name is Little T. You know, that kid singer.
He's not just a kid singer.
He's the coolest, cutest guy in the universe.
Some would beg to differ.
I've been reading all about him.
Listen to this: "He loves video games, cheeseburgers, and basketball.
"He hates rainy days, anchovies, and phony people".
He is so deep.
You're telling me.
He likes all the same stuff I like.
God, I'd love to meet him someday.
I wonder what I'd say.
How about, "Hold the anchovies"?
Very funny, Carlton.
You know, it's just because you've never really been in love.
I don't like the ugly turn this is taking.
Carlton, what are you talking about?
I just don't think it's healthy that Ashley's so boy crazy.
Shouldn't she be playing with those toy ponies with the pink hair?
Carlton, it's just puppy love.
Don't you remember your first crush?
Yeah.
It was Tootie in The Facts of Life.
Wait.
You had a love thing for Tootie?
When did you get over it?
What do you mean "get over it"?
I'd still love to meet her someday.
I wonder what I'd say.
How about, "Hello, Tootie, I'm Fruity"?
Just because you've never been in love I've got the perfect idea for Ashley's birthday present.
- What's that, sweetheart?
- I know Little T's agent.
He used to go out with my friend Jennifer.
I'll bet he could get Ashley a front row seat at Little T's next concert.
Listen, Hilary, if you know his agent you can get something twice as good as that.
Two seats.
Let me walk you through this one.
Tomorrow is Ashley's birthday party.
Ashley has a crush on Little T. Birthday party.
Little T. Something beginning to gel here?
Wouldn't it be nice if Little T came to Ashley's birthday party?
That would be so cute.
Will everybody please be quiet?
I'm trying to think.
This party has been going on for an hour.
When is Little T gonna get here?
You know nothing about celebrities.
They always come to parties fashionably late.
For a celebrity, being an hour late is like being half an hour early.
Yeah?
Well, if he's not here Hi, kids.
I'm Tidy the Clown.
We are going to play a new game.
It's called Clean Up After Your Spoiled Little Selves.
- Mom, Dad, make him stop.
- What's the matter, baby?
Come on, a clown at a birthday party?
It's so babyish.
No, it's cool.
I'm about to get this party started right.
All right, kids, check it out.
I'm Ashley's cousin, Will and I'm about to hip y'all to this new style of dancing.
It's called dumb dancing, and no matter what you do you got to have a serious mug on the whole time.
So y'all peep this here.
All right.
Come on.
Now you give it a try.
Yeah, like that'll be happening.
Yeah, man, who invited the old guy?
My brother, you want to take this outside?
Will, will you cut it out?
You are wrecking the party.
I mean, this stuff is for babies: clowns, dance contests.
Hi, kids.
Prepare to be amazed.
It's time for the great Carltoni.
I wish I was never born.
Great.
Now, that's Little T's agent.
I was the only one who thought Home Alone would make money.
Yeah, that was me.
Got to go.
- Lee.
- Hilary.
Listen, sorry I'm late, but I was just at Goldie's house and Goldie and Chevy and Mel were there.
It just turned into a thing and, you know As usual, I had to straighten it out.
But, you know Exactly.
Well, is Little T here?
Hey, would I lie to you?
Happy birthday, Ashley.
Are you feeling better?
I can't believe I just did that.
This is so embarrassing.
- It's not so bad.
- Come on.
I've always been planning on things to say if I got a chance to meet you.
Then I finally meet you, and I don't even make a sound.
I don't know about that.
You made a pretty good thud when you hit the ground.
Did I really?
God, I can't even faint right.
Come on.
You mean this is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?
- I guess not.
- What was?
I can't tell you.
It's too embarrassing.
I'll tell you my most embarrassing moment.
I was dressing for gym class during a fire drill and I had to run out of the building in my drawers.
Okay, I'll tell you mine.
It was the Honor Day assembly.
I was sitting with my legs crossed for the whole time.
And when they called my name for the English award I stood up and started across the stage, only my leg was asleep.
And then, thwap!
I fell flat on my face.
Come to think of it most of my embarrassing moments involve me hitting the floor.
You're really funny.
You're really cool, too.
- Who, me?
- Yeah.
Look, I've got to go.
Sorry we didn't have more time to talk.
I mean, what with you being unconscious and all.
- Okay, thanks for coming.
- Sure.
- Look, you want to go out sometime?
- Who, me?
I thought we'd go out for pizza tomorrow night.
I mean, if you're free.
I'd have to check my calendar, but I think I'm free.
Okay, then can I come around 7:00?
- Okay.
- Okay, then.
- I guess I'll go now.
- I'll walk you to the door.
I'm hungry.
Would you like a sandwich?
No, thanks, Mom.
I'm just too excited.
I can never eat before a big date.
Do I look okay?
Hilary, it's not even your date.
It's Ashley's date.
Yeah, but still, do I look okay?
Hilary, baby, calm down.
I'm sorry, Mom, but this is the most exciting day in a girl's life.
I mean, it's Ashley's first date.
And it's with a celebrity.
It is so gratifying to see her developing the right values.
- Guys, don't do that.
- What?
You know, sigh like that.
You make me feel like Benji.
Okay.
We're just excited, that's all.
We'll calm down.
- Thanks.
Could you check my hair?
- Sure.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go in the living room and wait for Little T. Just a second.
Baby, I just want to get one picture.
Mom, not the camcorder.
But, sweetheart, this is your first date.
- This only happens once in your life.
- Thank God.
Okay, now turn around so we can see your pretty dress.
Go back out and come in again the way you did.
Go on.
Hilary, you sit there drinking your coffee the way you were.
That was great.
No, Mom.
Let's do it again.
I wasn't happy with what I did.
Ashley, go back out again.
Guys, will you cut it out?
You're driving me crazy.
He's a very special boy and I don't want to be so nervous that I mess things up.
In case you don't remember, this is my first date.
I'm telling you, Uncle Phil, he kissed her right on her mouth.
It was really more on the cheek.
Yeah, but he was aiming for her mouth and he missed.
The kid is not only aggressive, but inaccurate and that's a dangerous combination.
You're getting all worked up over nothing.
He's just a 13-year-old boy.
Uncle Phil, you don't understand.
This is serious.
I know what goes on in the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
Considering you still have the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
Will's got a good point.
When I was 13, I harbored some pretty impure thoughts about Tootie.
Look, I wasn't thrilled about her going out in the first place.
She's only 12.
But she had her heart set on it.
Besides, the kid's agent is chaperoning.
So what could possibly happen?
That's them.
This discussion is at an end.
Master T and Mr. Lee Cohen.
Hey, you're English.
You know, I represent some English bands.
- Ever heard of Duran Duran?
- Why, yes.
When they came to me, they were just Duran.
I added the second Duran, and bang-o!
You must be so proud.
Hi, Mr. Banks.
I brought some flowers for Ashley.
Now, that's sweet.
Isn't that sweet, Will, Carlton?
Yeah, real sweet.
- This evening should be fun.
- I hope it will be, son.
Ashley's in the kitchen.
Why don't you join her?
Isn't that sweet?
He seems really excited about his first date.
First date?
Dream on.
- First date today, maybe.
- Pardon me?
When he's on tour, he's gotta beat the chicks away with a stick.
Wish I had a piece of that action.
- Action.
- Isn't that sweet?
You kids have a great time at the pizza place.
We will.
Did you hear that?
"We will".
All right, kids.
Let's party.
Okay, sweetie.
Bye-bye.
Have a good time.
- Have fun, you guys.
- Bye-bye.
- Follow them.
- Out.
When I first read the script of Pretty Woman it was called Attractive Woman.
I said, "Come on, guys, let's go all the way with this".
So they changed the title, and bang-o!
- So, what's your favorite video game?
- Tetris.
- Me, too.
- I brought my Game Boy.
- So you want to play?
- Okay.
He's got his arm around her already.
That's the same arm I used when I was 13.
- It's that love arm.
- We better work fast.
Let's roll.
Hey, Ashley, Little T, what's going on?
What are you two doing here?
Uncle Phil got hungry, so he sent us to pick up a dozen pizzas.
- Ashley, can I speak to you for a minute?
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?
- Don't get upset, but it's your hair.
It's doing a weird kind of bird's nest thing.
You might wanna get a hairbrush and fix it.
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna be straight with you.
You're going out with my little cousin.
You better not try nothing.
Don't give me that innocent role.
I know what you people in the music business are like.
Makes me sick.
Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.
From the current issue of Right On!
magazine.
There's a picture of you at the recent Soul Train Awards.
Maybe you'd be kind enough to tell us who this bimbo is on your arm.
That's my mom.
Sorry.
All right.
You covered yourself on that one but what about this girlie action you been getting on tour?
Your agent told me all about it.
Did you believe my agent?
Man, he lies about everything.
He told me I could have a career in singing.
Look, guys, with all the recording, touring, and my homework I haven't had any time for girls.
To tell you the truth, this is my first real date.
I knew that.
I just brought Carlton down 'cause I had to prove it to him.
Let's go.
Carlton, I looked at my hair and it was fine.
If you two don't mind, I'd like to continue with my date alone.
- Okay, we're going.
- Check you later, Ash.
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.
Don't worry about it.
- So, you want to play some more Tetris?
- Okay.
- I'm really having a good time, Ashley.
- So am I. I don't believe you, Philip.
Sending Will and Carlton to spy on your own daughter?
What's wrong with that?
She is my daughter.
I'd do it again, damn it.
Word to big bird.
Just say the word and we there, Uncle Phil.
But this was such a big night for Ashley.
Mom and I were so happy for her.
What got into you guys?
I know it was a big night for her.
I knew it had to come sometime.
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
She's really growing up.
I guess it's time for us to stop butting into her life so much.
No, it's not!
Hi, everybody.
- How did it go?
- I'm not going to talk about it.
Come on.
Please.
Okay.
Well, he did kiss me.
I want to hear all the details.
We'll pop some popcorn, do our nails and you can tell me every single thing that happened tonight.
I'd like a written copy of that report.
Ashley, sweetie when you walked in from that date with that smile on your face - That's a moment I will always remember.
- That's nice, Mom.
Could you go out and do it again, and I'll go get the camcorder?
- Mom.
- Okay, just asking.
Good night.
My little princess.
I cannot believe my little girl went out on a real date tonight.
He's a really nice guy, Daddy.
I know, but there's something you should know, sweetheart.
What?
I'm never gonna like anybody you bring home.
- That's awfully fair of you.
- It's not that they're not good.
It's just that nobody is good enough for you.
Good night, Daddy.
Look, I'm just sorry I wrecked your date.
You didn't, Will.
It was the most wonderful night of my life.
Really?
That's great.
I think your second date will be even better 'cause when you're 21, you can appreciate these things more.
Will, I'm going out with him again next Saturday.
Next Saturday I'm busy.
You'll have to change that.
I know you're busy.
That's why I made it for then.
- Good night, Will.
- Good night, Ash.
You should try rapping.
When you're rapping, you mess up the words and make up some new ones right there on the spot.
Let's try this.
I'll sing one line, you make up a line to rhyme it.
- Okay.
- All right.
Let's see.
"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" - I'm thinking, all right?
- That's all right.
We got all day.
- Okay, I've got it.
- Here we go.
"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" "I'd like to hit her in the head with Roget's Thesaurus" "Don't need no choir when you're a rapper" "Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down and zap her" "Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing" "Get a load of me and my rapping cousin"
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hey, beautiful.
I love a woman with good reflexes.
Makes me crazy.
Get out.
Your mouth is saying "get out," but your eyes are saying "get busy".
Daddy?
?
?
That's not going to work this time, Hil, darling.
Uncle Phil went to the supermarket, so he'll be gone for at least a week.
Mom?
?
?
She went with him.
Geoffrey?
?
?
- Yes, Miss Hilary?
- You know the drill.
Hilary, why is it so hard for you to be nice to Jazz?
You know he likes you.
I'm supposed to be nice to everyone who likes me?
How much time do you think I have?
So that's the reason for you to be mean to Jazz?
- Look, Jazz will be fine.
- You think so?
Well, I don't.
You don't know Jazz the way I know him.
He's a very sensitive person.
He has feelings that are very deep.
When you had Geoffrey throw him out, I think that was the last straw.
- I don't think he'll ever be the same.
- Really?
Want to kiss my boo-boo?
I hope that you didn't take my throwing you out of the house personally, Mr. Jazz.
- It was strictly business.
- That's cool.
If you grab me in that place again, we're engaged.
Look, Jazz, if you want to get with Hilary you got to have a plan.
You mean mine hasn't been working?
Jazz, that's the 18th time she threw you out of the house.
All a part of my plan.
We're home.
Later.
- Geoffrey, the groceries are in the kitchen.
- Yes, madam.
- Carlton has sunk to a new low.
- What?
- Carlton, what's up with the crutches?
- I'm practicing my new scam.
Girls love a guy with a sports injury.
I can't see too many honeys being impressed by: "Babe, I busted myself up playing peewee football".
Mom, Dad, I'm so glad you're home.
- I have exciting news about my job.
- What is it?
I'm not going to just tell you.
That's no fun.
Guess.
- Did you sell a painting at the gallery?
- No.
- Did you get a promotion?
- No.
- Did you get fired?
- No, I quit.
- What?
- I was definitely the closest.
Hilary, you were doing so well at the art gallery.
Yeah, but, Mom, it's not really a cool job.
When I was a little girl, I had a dream that when I grew up, I'd have a glamorous job in a glamorous office.
At parties, people would ask what I did and I'd tell them.
I imagined them turning pea-green with envy and blurting out: "You are so lucky," and walking away eaten up inside because I had a fabulous job and they didn't.
They say Gandhi had a very similar childhood dream.
All right, young lady, how do you propose to get this glamorous job?
I already got it.
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be the personal assistant to Marissa Redman.
- The movie star?
- Wow, she's really big.
What?
She ain't do nothing good in years.
That's not true.
She's one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood.
- She won an Oscar.
- Nominated.
And she was in one of the top 10 movies of all time.
Eight years ago.
And she needs a new assistant because she just got back from a well-deserved year off.
Nose job.
How did you know all of that?
I have an inquiring mind.
Will, please.
Hilary's obviously very excited about this job.
Be a little more supportive.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Hilary, I loved her in that musical she did.
God, what a voice.
Lip-synch.
Dinner is served.
- Jazz, I thought you left.
- Why?
Because you walked out the door and you said, "Later".
All a part of my plan.
- Did you hear the news about Hilary?
- Yeah.
I'm so proud of her.
Okay, tomorrow's her first day at work.
I think I got a little plan that will make Hilary like you.
Tomorrow we'll go down there and you're gonna surprise her with flowers and candy.
Cool.
Meet you here tomorrow at 9:00 sharp.
- You got it, man.
- Don't forget the candy and flowers.
Miss Tony Fisher, please.
Hi, Tony.
It's Hil.
How's your job going?
Guess where I'm calling from.
No, guess.
No, guess again.
What do you mean you give up?
This is fun.
No, guess again.
No, don't hang up, Tony.
Do not hang up now.
Come on, guess.
No, guess again.
Okay, I'm in Marissa Redman's office.
No, it's my first day.
What's she like?
Tony, I have to tell you, you'd never know she was a movie star.
I mean, she's so grounded.
She's so real.
I don't care if you have other appointments, clown.
My cat needs acupuncture.
- Marissa.
- Heather.
- Hilary.
- Let's get one thing straight.
My last assistant quit on me because I never learned her name.
Now, is that going to be a problem?
- No.
- Good.
I'm so excited.
I want to learn all about the movie business.
And you will.
The key is to be positive.
I like positive people.
- Are you positive?
- Yes!
Yes.
Remember, this is a process.
You do realize it's a process?
Yes.
I'm positive it's a process.
- I'll get that.
- You got that right.
Miss Redman's office.
I'm afraid Miss Redman's on the other line now, Mr. Haskell - but I'll see if she's finishing up.
- It's my agent.
Hello, Sam.
This better be good news.
So you're saying I didn't get the part?
I know the part called for a Meryl Streep type.
Yes, I'm a Meryl Streep type if I want to be.
It's called acting, Sam.
So what fool got the part?
Meryl Streep.
Ain't that cozy?
I'm sorry you didn't get the part, Marissa.
But let's be positive.
After all, this is a process.
Shut up.
I have to go to a restaurant opening tonight.
So I need you to pick up my clothes from the cleaners.
I'm not speaking to my tired boyfriend, so I'll need someone to go with.
I wonder if that cute little Johnny Gill is free.
- Isn't he, like, my age?
- I see.
I get it.
First, I'm too black to play Meryl Streep's parts and now I'm too old to date a 20-year-old.
Cher can do it, but I can't?
No, Marissa, I didn't mean anything like that.
Everyone's trying to fit me into their nice, neat little box.
You're walking a fine line, Helena.
A very fine line.
Hello, I'm calling from Marissa Redman's office.
Is her dry-cleaning ready?
It says here on the ticket: "Three dresses, two blouses, four silk brassieres "and eight pair of underwear".
Fantastic.
I'll be right over to pick them up.
Glamour, glamour, glamour.
You know, while you're down there you may even get to see Dustin Hoffman's drawers.
Will, what are you doing here?
Congratulations on your new job, Hilary.
Flowers, a Kit Kat and a song.
All the way from Compton, California the king of the keyboard himself, just for you, Hilary.
It's Jazz!
- He plays so beautiful.
Don't you agree?
- What is going on here?
- Marissa, I can explain.
- I don't even want to hear it.
So I've got a party girl on my hands.
Is that it?
As soon as I turn my back.
We've got a word for people like you in this business and it's called Hello.
Miss Redman, we didn't mean to get Hilary in any trouble.
- I'm her cousin.
- She's not in any trouble.
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your name.
Will Smith.
Little Willie Smith.
I like that.
Yeah, but little Willie's got to go now.
- We'll get right out of your way.
- No, you're not in my way.
Well, you kind of are.
Why don't you stay for a little while?
You know, we'd love to, but we made other plans.
No, we didn't.
Don't you remember, Jazz you've got that brain-surgery appointment.
- Must have forgotten.
- Bye-bye.
You know, I just had a thought.
I'm sure it's brilliant.
What is it?
I thought I'd like to take your cousin Will to that restaurant opening tonight.
- What?
- Are you thinking I'm too old for him?
You think he wouldn't want to go out with me?
No, Marissa, I mean, who wouldn't want to go out with you?
You better hope he does.
Because if he doesn't want to go out with me tonight, you're fired, Hester.
I forfeit the game.
Thanks a lot, G. He was about to take me.
Hi, Will.
Look who's home.
It's Miss Hollywood.
Tell me all about your faboo day.
So what did you do this afternoon?
Massage her feet, give her cat a perm?
Will, I love your irreverent sense of humor.
It's so refreshing.
How you trying to play me, Hilary?
Will, you're always thinking the worst of me.
I have got some great news for you.
Guess who I can get to go out with you.
- Janet Jackson?
- Guess again.
- Jody Watley.
- Guess again.
Tell me, or I'll kill you.
Marissa Redman.
You've got to be tripping.
Hilary, I wouldn't go out with her if she and Marsha Warfield were the last two women on earth.
Will, please.
Marissa said if I can't get you to go out on a date with her, she'll fire me.
Perfect.
All she does is yell at you, boss you around and treat you like dirt.
I know but I'm the envy of all my friends.
Hilary, come on, don't cry.
Don't cry.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
I guess it won't kill me to go out with Marissa Redman.
Will, thank you.
And I guess it won't kill you to go out with Jazz.
I can't believe that you agreed to go on this date with Jazz.
Shut up, Carlton.
I had to, or I'd lose my job.
Touchy, touchy.
Cut it out!
I can see it now.
Mr. and Mrs. Jazz - Does Jazz have a last name?
- I believe it's Matazz.
Will you three cut it out?
Philip, we don't mean anything by it.
I don't see the destruction of our gene pool as something to joke about.
- That must be Jazz.
- Marissa's meeting us at the restaurant.
- We can't be a second late.
- Just relax, Hilary.
Just make sure you're sweet to Jazz.
This is making his whole week.
- Mr. Jazz.
- Yo, G. As of tonight, my new official name is Mr. Lucky.
Marissa, thanks for inviting us.
This is such an exciting new restaurant.
Look at that.
Butter on ice.
I'm living large now.
Speaking of ice, Jazz - doesn't Hilary look a little chilly?
- Right.
- You are so beautiful, baby.
- Jazz, please.
Now, I know you can be nicer than that.
All right.
That was a wonderful imitation of a creepy spider you just did, Jazz.
Hey, Cher!
Sophomore in high school.
Beat that, honey.
Do you know what time it is, Hilary?
It's 8:15.
No, it's not.
It's "slow dancing with Jazz" time.
No, it isn't.
You know, it's either "slow dancing with Jazz" time or "Will getting up, going home, and leaving you without a job" time.
Jazz, do you want to dance?
Man, this must be my birthday.
When you get back, bring me a mineral water three ice cubes, a lemon, and a lime.
For the sake of novelty, get it right this time.
Yes, Marissa.
So, little Willie, would you pass me the salt, please?
Sure.
Jazz, I feel I should tell you something.
I'm only on this date with you as part of my deal with Will.
- I know.
- You do?
It doesn't bother me but if it's making you feel sad dancing with me, you don't have to.
- No, Jazz, it's not that.
- Thank God.
It's just this job is getting to me.
I don't mind the hard work.
It's just I can't seem to do anything right.
She's always yelling at me.
Tell Jazz all about it.
Look.
Biggest director in town.
Sydney.
Congratulations.
Loved your new movie.
We've got to do What?
He just looked right through me.
Maybe you should have spoken up a little bit.
This is not good.
Hickory!
Yes.
I just saw Sydney, and he cut me dead.
Did you send him a bottle of champagne like I told you for the premiere of his crappy movie?
You said this morning you were thinking of sending him something but didn't know what.
Champagne would obviously be the perfect choice, Einstein.
Marissa, chill.
Come on.
She's trying.
Look, I work so hard.
I mean, I work harder than anybody, and I'm very underpaid and it does not help when the person who is supposed to be my assistant is a total idiot.
- You're the idiot.
- Well, date's over.
Look, I don't care how many movies you make.
Nobody don't talk like that to Hilary.
She's smart, sweet, and the most beautiful woman in the cosmos and she's been very nice to me tonight.
She's been nice to you, even though you didn't deserve it.
So you tell her you're sorry because I'm about to get pretty mad.
Shut up.
This is what you do.
Run to an all-night liquor store - No.
- Excuse me?
What do you think I am?
I shouldn't be treated like an idiot.
I'm not an idiot.
I'm smart.
And another thing, your last five movies really sucked big time.
Six.
You can't stand here talking like that to me.
You're right, because I have a prior engagement with someone from the A list.
Come on, Jazz, let's go.
Thank you, oh, Lord.
Who needs them?
They don't know how to appreciate you.
I mean, I think me and you can have a better time without them.
- Really?
- Psych.
You really said that to Marissa?
At least now Marissa the cradle crook knows what Hilary thinks about her.
And I owe it all to Jazz.
Thank you, Jazz.
Now my daughter's unemployed.
Daddy, you should thank Jazz.
He reminded me that I do have some self-respect.
Why chase after celebrities?
They're all so shallow and self-centered.
From now on, I want to spend time with people who have depth intelligence, and maturity.
I don't like the sound of this.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.
Night, baby.
Guys, I'm sorry the night was so awful.
Hilary, I'm just grateful I got my young body out of there before old Marissa put some miles on it.
I got to go.
- Peace.
- Peace, babe.
Jazz, wait.
Listen.
Thank you.
I mean - Thanks.
- Sure, babe.
You want to go out with me on Saturday night?
I don't think it's a good time.
I'd only say "yes" because I felt like I owed you something.
That's cool with me.
Maybe some other time.
Okay.
Good night, Hilary.
No, wait.
All a part of my plan.
