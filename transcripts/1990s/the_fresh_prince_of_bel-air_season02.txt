{START OF EPISODE 1}
Yes.
Yes, I love you too, Mom.
Yes, Mommy.
Okay.
Mom!
No, I'm not gonna get my nose pierced.
Yes, Mom, I'm very happy with the holes that God gave me.
Mom Am I eating a balanced diet?
I'd say so.
Mom, no, I'm not making any extra work for Geoffrey.
He hardly even knows I'm here.
Mom, I told you this morning, Carlton and I are getting along great.
Mom, I keep Yo, everything is Mop & Glo, Mom.
They love me here.
Will!
Excuse me, Mom, me and Uncle Phil are about to go for a run.
Another minute, madam, and perhaps we'll have a diamond.
I don't know why Philip insisted on putting in all these new gadgets.
To heat something up, I have to be It.
Uhura of the Starship Enterprise.
Mom, I can't use the phone.
We're all supposed to share it but Will talks to Kathleen morning, noon and night.
I've been putting up with it for weeks, and excuse my strong language but I am not a happy camper.
Will's in love, baby.
I think it's sweet.
No, no, no, baby.
No, I wuv you more.
Yes.
No, no, no, no, I wuv you more!
All right, you wuv me more.
Isn't that romantic?
He's quoting Elmer Fudd.
Hold on, Kathleen.
Click on the other line.
Hi!
It's me!
No, no, no, I miss you more.
No!
I miss you more.
All right, you miss me more.
Oh, you gotta go?
I'm gonna miss you.
No, no, I'm gonna miss you more!
Nice trick by Aunt Viv.
Dad got us all tickets to the People's Choice Awards.
Thanks for butting in, Hilary.
Anyway, the best part is We get to sit with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.
- Hilary, you promised I could tell.
- I know.
I lied.
I am so excited!
Everyone from the A list is gonna be there, which means none of my friends are gonna be there, which means they are all going to corrode with envy and hate my guts.
I love it!
I'm going to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Thank you, sir!
- Thank you!
- Hold on, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey.
You're not having dinner with the Terminator.
- I didn't get you a ticket.
- That's ugly.
Philip, how could you be so insensitive?
Geoffrey is a part of this family.
- Major faux pas, Dad.
- Poor Geoffrey.
Like his life isn't sad enough already.
Look, Geoffrey, I sincerely apologize for my oversight but since this means so much to you, and you are a part of the family I'm sure someone here will be glad to give up their ticket for you.
- These juice sticks - I have to call Toni.
Takeout food again?
Well, we were having leg of lamb but I accidentally put the oven on self-cleaning and now the door won't open.
Takeout again?
No, Hilary, I bought a new set of Styrofoam.
Gosh, Mom, who put the rusty nails in your granola?
Look, all this hi-tech has got me a little on edge.
I'm so sorry, sweetie.
Takeout food again?
What happened to the leg of lamb?
It's being cleaned!
Is that a problem?
Geoffrey, we're ready to serve dinner!
Takeout again?
My baby's observant.
Isn't she observant?
Not that observant.
Kathleen, your blouse is unbuttoned.
- Let me.
- Let her.
Better idea.
That food smells terrible.
I feel like I'm sitting in coach.
Oh, thank you for inviting me to the People's Choice Awards.
Think nothing of it, it was no big deal.
Oh, it was more than a big deal, Uncle Phil, it was a humongous deal!
I know, and we get to sit with all the stars!
People would kill to get those tickets.
Pardon me while I go get a knife.
- Philip!
- I'll get him a ticket.
Everyone, look what Will did.
He cut my steak in the shape of a heart.
Isn't he artistic?
Actually, that was a puppy.
Oh, whatever it is, it's beautiful.
I'm gonna save it.
And every time I look at it, I'm gonna think of my baby.
Excuse me.
This is the dinner table, not the back seat of a Chevy.
I want to talk to you two in the other room.
Now.
Now, it's time we discussed this relationship.
Vivian, discuss it.
- What Philip is trying to say is - Don't come around here with no babies.
Hold it, hold it.
Is that what this is all about?
Look, Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv, I think you guys can relax.
You don't have to worry about us coming around here with no babies.
I mean, we don't even know no babies.
Look, kids, now, we know you care about each other but you have only been dating a short time.
The kind of thing you're talking about takes commitment.
You know, Aunt Viv, you're absolutely right.
Commitment is what this is all about.
And as a token of my commitment I got Kathleen this ring.
- Oh, Will!
- Oh, no.
Oh, God!
Geoffrey, where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
Mrs. Banks sent me on some errands.
That is my job.
I am but a lowly servant.
Geoffrey, it took some doing, but I managed to get you a ticket.
Thank you sir.
I am most grateful.
Now I won't have to slash your tires.
- I'm sitting next to Arnold.
- No, I'm sitting next to Arnold.
I don't want my tires slashed.
Geoffrey's sitting next to Arnold.
This dress makes me want to puke.
You can't even tell I have a figure.
You're 13 years old.
You're not allowed to have a figure.
- You look better.
- No, no, no, no, baby, you look better.
- No, you look better.
- All right, I look better.
Except for that rock.
Man!
If you value your vision, you won't look directly into the rock.
I love it, Will, thank you.
Dad?
- I'm ready.
- Finally!
What took you so long?
Oh, I just spent an hour chasing my outfit on the new rotating dress rack.
Why didn't you set the variable speed adjuster?
Philip, these gadgets are making my life miserable.
Baby, you're the one that's wanted to redecorate.
Well, yeah, I wanted to keep up with the Joneses, honey, not the Jetsons!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look, before y'all split each other's wigs - can we have our tickets, please?
- Oh, sure.
You lost them, didn't you?
No I did not lose them, thank you very much.
I know exactly where they are.
They're in my desk, in my office downtown.
No problem.
We'll just hop on my dress rack and swing by.
Geoffrey, Mrs. Banks and I are going to swing by my office.
Will's going to ride with Kathleen and you can drive the kids, so we'll meet you at the awards.
Very good, sir.
Boy, this is a rare treat.
I get to cruise Beverly Hills in a Volvo.
Hold up, baby.
I want to go get my lucky mitt.
I want Darryl Strawberry to sign it.
What's your lucky mitt?
It's sort of like my lucky drawers, except I wear it on my hand.
Man, this door is like straight out of Blacula.
It's like the '70s crawled up in here and died.
Yeah, J. J. Walker's lips are probably around here somewhere.
This is all my stuff I brought from Philly, you know.
When I get homesick I come down here.
It makes me feel better.
Where's my mitt at?
Here it is.
My mom gave me this.
She taught me how to play.
That's why I took up basketball.
Oh, hold on.
Yo, Teddy jam.
Man, I used to love this old thing.
- He's so cute!
- But I'm cuter.
Beat it, Ted.
See?
I told you I knew where they were.
- Fine, Philip, let's go.
- Okay.
Vivian?
Did you see Oh, my God.
Philip?
Geoffrey!
Take it easy on the curves!
It's not me, Master Carlton, it's the road.
It thinks it's an Earthquake!
Will?
- It's over, Will, we're all right.
- The ground moved, all right?
The ground.
The ground moved, all right?
The ground moved!
Baby, it was just a little earthquake.
Baby, no, listen, no.
The ground moved, okay?
The ground.
The ground moved.
Nobody was bothering it, it just moved, all right?
- But it's over now, and we're fine.
- I am not fine, all right?
I'm a grown man sitting under a table hugging a teddy bear.
- I am not fine.
- Oh, poor baby.
I'm really, really not fine.
I'm really, really, really not fine.
Come on, let's get up and find out what's going on.
Hold it, baby.
I'm really really not fine, though.
Will, I think the door's stuck.
Oh, no, no.
No, dear, you must be crazy.
I won't let this door be stuck.
Okay, I can't breathe.
Calm down.
Look, someone's got to come home sometime.
Baby, we'll only be down here a couple of hours.
Okay.
But what if you wrong?
Okay?
What if they don't come home for, like, ten years?
We'd just be like two real, real fly skeletons.
Oh, man.
I may never see my mom again.
I may never see Zimbabwe.
Never dunk on Michael Jordan.
I may never see Rudy get married on The Cosbys.
Daddy, get us off this freeway!
- Don't panic, Hilary.
- Yeah, I don't want to have to slap you.
Try it and you'll be singing soprano.
Calm down!
I'm sure traffic will be moving any minute.
It was just a small tremor.
- Any word on Will and Kathleen?
- They're probably stuck in traffic as well.
This freeway's backed up for miles!
Okay.
Okay, kids?
We're gonna stay at my office until the power comes back on.
- You behave yourselves.
And Geoffrey?
- Sir?
Hang in there.
Here we go, babe.
A spot for me and a spot for you.
Whoa, whoa Kathleen, hold up.
That's my spot.
Your spot's over here.
- But your spot is more comfortable.
- I know.
That's why it's my spot.
- Please?
- All right, all right.
How can I resist those big green eyes?
Wait, baby, what happened to your big green eyes?
I put them in my little black purse.
Oh!
You wear contacts!
Is that okay?
Yeah.
I mean Look, I love you for what's on the inside.
And I love you because you're so wonderful.
Will, be careful!
That's real hair!
Then why isn't it growing out your scalp?
I just wanted to look extra special for you tonight.
You do, baby.
You always do.
I mean, look, not that it matters.
I mean, well, it does, but Hey, look, I'm sorry I threw your hair.
I forgive you.
Now, where were we?
Beat it, baby!
Will!
It's just an aftershock!
Aftershock?
Baby, look, I'm from Philly.
"Aftershock" is not in my vocabulary.
Wind, rain, cheese steak, these are things I know.
It's nothing.
Now would you come back over here?
Why not?
Because every time I come near you, the ground starts moving.
I'm just trying to get back to Philly where the ground stays still and the people move.
Wilma!
So what do you want to sing?
How about Go Away Little Girl?
Why don't we listen to the radio?
With all due respect, Geoffrey, I'll pick the station.
Let me do it.
- I'm not listening to that.
- Well, I'm not listening to that.
- Cut it out, you guys!
- You cut it out!
- Don't you talk to me like that!
- I will talk to you - Geoffrey, what did you do that for?
- It was either the knob or one of you.
Look what I found in the old man's office.
Philip, you ought to be ashamed of yourself going through your partner's things.
What brand is it?
You know this is the first time we have been alone together in weeks.
- Try months.
- And you look ravishing by candlelight.
I know!
And you smell as appetizing as you look.
Philip, are you trying to put the moves on me?
- Yes.
Is it working?
- Yes.
Want a belly rub?
You know this earthquake could have been the big one.
We shouldn't argue about things that just don't matter.
And I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about the gadgets.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I get carried away with those things at times, baby.
I'll cut back.
- What is that?
- It's my automatic pulse monitor.
It likes you.
Well, honey, I hope it has a warranty.
I'm hungry.
Don't you have any more breath mints?
No, you ate them all without offering me one.
- Can't have my toothpick, either.
- Did I ask you?
Look, baby, why don't you just look in the freezer and see if there's something in there?
- Would you look?
- Why don't you look?
I thought you liked doing things for me.
Yes, I did, until you ate all my breath mints.
Forget it.
I don't need you to do anything for me.
Could you open this?
Thought you ain't need me to do nothing for you.
Just open it.
- What's the magic word?
- Now!
Guess again.
Here, look, I can't open this thing.
I thought you supposed to be the big man.
Look, you the one that's hungry.
Use your fingernails.
Look, look.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, look, Kathleen, in the last three hours you took out your eyeballs, your fingernails your eyelids, and your hair.
Now what else on your body can I get at the mall?
- You are so rude!
- Me?
I've been bending over backwards trying to make you happy.
You the one that started tripping, ate all my breath mints.
You mention those breath mints one more time, I'm gonna scream!
Breath mints.
Breath mints.
Breath mints breath mints, breath mints!
Wow!
Everything looks okay here to me.
Yeah.
It's too bad those lights came back on down at the office.
Baby, we can turn them off here.
- What was that?
- Sounded like a scream.
Yeah, your mom sucks breath mints, too!
And I never really thought your ears were cute, I just thought they were big.
Yeah, well, a lot of women seem to find them extremely attractive.
Oh, yeah, like who?
Dumbo's mother?
Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Lee Press-On Ears.
You know, Will, I am so glad we got stuck down here together.
It gave me a chance to see who you really are.
You know, it gave me a chance to see who you really are, too.
And most of you is in a pile over there on the floor!
Yeah, right next to your stupid teddy bear.
Hey, hey, don't be dissing my bear!
Well, don't be dissing my hair.
You know what?
Let's kill all this noise, sweetheart.
Maybe we don't know each other as well as we thought.
Listen to me, I'm starting to sound like my Uncle Phil.
Next thing I know, I'm going to wake up bald and hungry.
Yeah, we have been moving a little fast.
I guess I should give this back.
Now come on, baby.
No, that's cool, keep that.
Well, it probably cost you a lot of money.
No, it didn't.
Will!
Kathleen?
Are you down there?
Aunt Viv, the door is stuck!
Oh, you poor babies!
You've been trapped down here all this time.
Will, where is Kathleen?
It's me, Mrs. Banks.
I probably should go call my parents.
- Bye, Will.
- Bye, babe.
Well, thank God nothing happened to you.
Nothing did happen, right?
Well, to be honest, something did happen.
Me and Kathleen decided we just gonna chill out for a little bit.
Y'all were right.
Now I'm gonna call my mom.
She's probably worried about me.
Philip, did you hear that?
He said we were right.
Yeah.
All it took was an earthquake.
You think something hit him on the head?
English
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Damn.
I can't believe it.
The school's like three miles away.
It took us 45 minutes to get home.
I know, sweetheart.
Those traffic jams can be so frustrating.
Wasn't no traffic.
It was Carlton's driving.
It was old people in walkers passing us.
Look, the fact that I'm safety conscious does not mean I drive like a little old man.
Carlton, please, George Burns flipped you the bird.
He was waving.
The man has arthritis.
Hey, look, don't feel bad, Aunt Viv.
At least you have two normal daughters.
I have been stabbed in the back.
Is nothing sacred?
Is there, like, no honor?
Baby, what's the matter?
Francesca asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding.
There is, like, no God, okay.
And?
Well, what do you mean, "And"?
She expects me to take care of the rice they throw when they leave the church.
Like I'm gonna learn how to cook just for her wedding.
Aunt Viv, don't feel bad.
At least you have one normal daughter.
Aunt Viv, I'd say it's about time you started feeling bad.
Is Linda Blair down there?
Ashley, baby, are you all right?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I guess the pain was just too much to bear.
I'm not surprised, 180 degrees.
Yo, take 1,000 aspirin, drink 50 gallons of water and stay in bed until Carlton's voice changes.
Ashley, baby, now you've been acting strange all day.
What's going on?
There's this science test tomorrow on the plant kingdom.
It's really hard.
Honey, all we've ever asked is that you try to do your best.
I know.
And how are you gonna know what your best is unless you try?
Now you go upstairs and study until bedtime.
Okay.
Kids, man, kids.
I mean, it's like you love them and you love them and you love them but sometimes, you know, they make you just wanna pull out your tongue.
Come in.
Ashley, what is wrong with you?
Look, playing sick by putting a thermometer over a 100-watt light bulb is not the way to solve your problems.
The key is a 60-watt light bulb.
Thanks, Will.
But what I really need to know is how to kick someone's butt.
Word up.
Carlton getting on your nerves, too?
It's not Carlton.
It's this girl Paula Hoover.
If I don't give her my lunch, she hits me.
And tomorrow at 3:00, she's gonna beat me up whether I feed her or not.
Well, I happen to know she ain't gonna be beating you up.
Why?
Did she die?
No.
I'm gonna teach you how to defend yourself.
Get up, girl.
Come on.
All right, look.
Step one: You gotta learn how to take somebody's heart, right?
In the old days, they used to call it selling woof tickets.
She won't buy anything from me, Will.
No.
See, a woof ticket is like a threat.
See, right?
It's all in your attitude.
It's like: Say, man!
Hey!
You don't get out of my face, man, I'm gonna hit you so hard your grandpa's gonna get a lump.
I will hit you so hard, it will bruise your great-grandfather badly.
That would be great if you were rumbling Princess Di.
But, no try it like this: Say, man!
I'm gonna hit you so hard you're gonna land in another zip code!
I'm going to hit you so hard you're going to land in another zip code!
Moving on.
Look, the next step is full-scale psychological warfare, right?
So you gotta act like you got this tick, right?
Like the army did this experiment on you, right, that just went terribly wrong.
Like: Back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all.
Mind your business.
Okay.
Back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all.
Just mind your business.
What the heck is going on here?
Hey, sorry, man.
Homegirl says she was a Vanilla Ice fan.
I kind of lost my head.
You expect me to believe that?
Everybody likes Vanilla Ice.
Now what's really going on?
Paula Hoover's been beating me up so Will's gonna show me how to fight her after school tomorrow.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Will.
Violence only begets violence.
Now that is not the way you deal with a bully.
Now I have found that as long as you pay them promptly they pretty much leave you alone.
I have been, and she still wants to beat me up.
Yeah, that's why she has to defend herself.
- Put your hands up - Not so.
You and Paula must find a common ground.
Remember, "We must never negotiate out of fear "but we must never fear to negotiate".
John F. Kennedy.
But never forget, Mama Said Knock You Out.
LL Cool J. Ashley, do you believe that violence is wrong?
Ashley, do you believe it's wrong to be this pathetic little wimp?
Yes.
Well, no.
I don't know.
Can I be alone now?
Well, Ashley, no matter whatever happens tomorrow just know that I believe in you.
And, Ashley, whatever happens tomorrow know that I believe Carlton is adopted.
Why don't you mind your business sometimes, man?
Every time I turn my head I knew she wouldn't show.
I don't blame her.
I'd whip her bootie.
I'd wax her tail.
I'd kick her heinie.
Hi, Paula.
- Nice shoes.
- Are you ready?
Okay, but it's only fair I warn you.
I'm gonna hit you so hard your grandpa's gonna be great in another area code or something.
Back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all.
Just mind your business.
Hey, if it isn't my cousin Ashley.
What a nice surprise.
I should have known you'd call in reinforcements, Banks.
And you must be the spawn of Satan.
It's just a coincidence, Paula.
Honest.
Ashley, isn't this a nice surprise?
- What are you doing here, man?
- I'm her brother.
What do you want?
To humiliate the girl?
Do you guys mind?
I'm beating someone else up at 4:00.
Listen, Paula the great Martin Luther King taught us that violence is never the way.
We must rise above hate and mend our differences to perseverance and love.
Thank you for helping me prove my point.
Look, I will turn the other cheek.
Running a little low on cheeks there, bro?
You cannot make me angry, Paula.
Because if I surrender to anger I have surrendered my very independence.
You know, Paula, even the great Martin Luther King probably drew the line somewhere.
And it was probably somewhere around that region you were just aiming.
Girlfriend, we need to talk.
I just got a little bit of a beef with you, you know?
You've been messing with my cousin Ashley, right?
I gotta be honest with you, it's kind of ticking me off.
I'm quaking in my tube socks.
She's funny.
Hey, look, you know what?
This goes against everything that I believe but you're giving me no choice.
Give you $5, you leave her alone.
$50.
$50?
How are you playing me?
$50?
Come on, $20.
$50.
$50?
How are you Come on, baby, I ain't $30.
$50.
All right, deal.
It's kind of a rough neighborhood.
You want to walk me to my car?
I just don't see what's wrong with the dress.
Francesca, remember the first day of junior high when you showed up in a reversible poncho?
Who hid you under the bleachers?
You did, Hilary.
That's right, because I care about you.
Remember freshman year?
Do I need to bring up the culotte incident?
Then I think it's time we stopped the madness.
Francesca, this dress, it's an abomination.
What if we add a dickey?
Why don't we just wear Wax Lips?
Hilary, you haven't agreed with one thing I've picked for my wedding.
Well, I agreed that you should wear white, and I think we all know that's a stretch.
I guess you're right.
So could you help me, please?
Well, I guess I could come up with a few tips.
Geoffrey, hit the lights.
Well, there must be some mistake.
Are you certain?
Thank you.
I appreciate the call.
I cannot believe this.
- Is everything all right, Mom?
- Yeah, what's up?
Well, that was Ashley's principal.
He said Ashley hasn't been to school for the last three days.
Now I don't understand this.
Now Ashley has been going to school every day and coming home at 3:30 like she always does.
Do you boys know anything about this?
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetheart.
How was school today?
It was great.
We had to write an essay in English.
I think I aced it.
Well, what did you write about?
My neck?
You wrote an entire essay on your neck.
That is quite impressive, sweetheart since your principal called and said that you have not been at school today yesterday, or the day before.
Philip, I'm glad you're home.
Ashley, go for the sympathy.
Cry like your life depended on it then try to throw up.
Fine, but if I go down, I am taking both of you with me.
You have a lot of explaining to do, young lady.
It was Paula Hoover.
She was beating me up.
Will and Carlton tried to get her to leave me alone but then she started again after Carlton's check bounced.
That little extortionist.
She promised she wouldn't cash my check until the weekend.
A bully is no reason to cut school, Ashley.
Uncle Phil, you haven't exactly seen Paula Hoover.
Like, picture Mike Tyson in a training bra.
Philip, I do not like the sound of this.
I think we should talk to the principal.
No.
I'll be a total outcast.
I'll have to eat lunch with the janitor.
Honey, we've got to do something.
Maybe we should invite Paula's parents over and get to the bottom of this.
Yo, word up.
I've got some boxing gloves, Uncle Phil.
You gotta get your own headgear, though.
"Let's get ready to rumble"!
- Paula's parents get here yet?
- No, not yet.
Good.
We got a little while for a few last-minute tips.
All right.
Check it out.
Act like you got this tick, right?
Like the army did this experiment on you that just went terribly wrong, right?
You be like: Back up!
Back up!
Mind your business, that's all.
Mind your business.
Will, we're going to settle things in a civilized manner.
That's how adults handle things.
Yeah, well, not in my neighborhood.
Hey, yo, I got your back, Uncle Phil, man.
You'd better get out of here before I get your butt.
Doctor and Mrs. Norbert Hoover.
Welcome.
I'm Philip and this is my wife, Vivian.
- Dr. Hoover.
- Mrs. Hoover.
And you must be Paula.
Geoffrey, why don't you take Paula into the kitchen?
I bet she would love some of your famous cookies.
Certainly.
Follow me, Miss Paula.
So, Doctor, what kind of a doctor are you?
I'm a child psychiatrist.
Now, young ladies, I have some wine to serve.
Will you two be able to refrain from battering each other in my absence?
No sweat, Lurch.
Still got it.
Paula is wonderful.
She's really, really adorable.
But we are very concerned that she and Ashley do not seem to be getting along.
We know.
Dr. Hoover and I had a long talk with Paula after you called.
Apparently, Ashley has been quite ruthless with her.
Well, you can't seriously think it's Ashley's fault.
It's understandable.
She's probably just self-conscious about that tick.
I'd be happy to prescribe something.
But you don't beat up everybody.
Why do you just pick on me?
Larry Wells.
You cut in when I was dancing with him after the game.
No.
I didn't want to cut in.
Hey, I was dancing with Brad Nelson, but he wanted to dance with you so I was stuck with that guy.
- I never even knew his name.
- Really?
Brad likes me?
Yeah.
Wow.
If I'd known, I never would have beat up his sister.
So you wanna be friends?
- As long as you're not after Larry Wells.
- Larry who?
Okay.
We're friends.
No!
Will!
Don't!
We're friends now.
Sure you don't want to get a couple sucker punches in there?
Your daughter suffers from displaced aggression syndrome.
Well, Dr. Hoover, I'm afraid I would have to get a second opinion before I could believe that.
It's definitely displaced aggression syndrome.
Let me put it in simpler terms.
This is where a child acts out the repressed hostility of an unhappy home.
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- Too many big words?
No, Miss Thing, but I got a couple of small words for you.
Vivian Hey, good news, people.
The girls are Obviously, your wife is upset.
It's common with women in mid-life.
I'd be happy to prescribe something.
Dr. Hoover, the school where you got your degree did you find it on the back of a matchbook?
- Please, my humble brothers, please - Penn State, my brother.
Really?
Good school.
I was thinking of going there if my scholarship to Princeton, Yale, Wharton, and Talladega Tech had fallen through.
Impressive.
You must have been quite an athlete in your thinner days.
Okay.
Time out.
Time out.
- Hey, let's stick to the topic, okay?
- Fine.
Speaking as a doctor I think your daughter ought to be heavily sedated and immediately institutionalized.
Well, speaking as a lawyer I can only say that your daughter suits the criminal profile to a tee, right down to the low-sloping forehead and the wide jaw suitable for grains and small rodents.
I think you must have her confused with your mama.
That's it, Uncle Phil!
You're grounded!
You know, I'd be happy to prescribe something for that.
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
I don't believe it.
I have never witnessed anything more humiliating in my life.
Jilted at the altar.
Other than crow's feet that is the worst thing that can happen to a woman.
Francesca was jilted?
No, I was talking about me.
All that hard work redesigning this dress, and that ingrate eloped.
And to think I was gracious enough to let her invite her hayseed grandmother.
Dad, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but it's got to be said.
What you did tonight was wrong.
Word, I gotta agree with Carlton.
Who said that?
I thought you said that's how you settled disputes in your old neighborhood.
No.
See, in my neighborhood we got this sacred code.
It's like: My broski!
Whatever you want to do broham, on the left or the right we can do that all night.
But all that old yackety-yak, jawbone, you kicking in the middle, man you can stop that, 'cause I ain't down with that.
You see what I'm saying?
No.
Me, neither.
That's why it's so sacred.
The point is, I was wrong.
I lost control.
Ashley, baby in the future, I hope you'll do what I say and not what I did.
Even though it felt good hitting that jerk tonight really, really good I was wrong.
Sometimes, what feels good is wrong.
Yeah.
Everything that feels good is wrong.
Everything.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Okay.
English
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Thirty seconds on high, Spock.
Energize.
Captain, we're going into a warp drive, we're running low on dilithium crystals.
Do something, Bones.
Jim, I'm a doctor, damn it, not a short-order cook.
Quit playing around.
I want to heat up my Sara Lee.
- Can you use the regular oven?
- Do I look like Wilma Flintstone?
That smells delicious.
Can I have some?
Come on, beat it, man.
There's barely enough for me.
Just the way I like them toasty warm.
All right, you pervert, hand over my Victoria's Secret catalogue.
This one's Geoffrey's.
He filled out the order form.
Geoffrey, you know a woman with a 46D cup?
No, but if there's a God in heaven I will by Christmas.
Yo, what's up, y'all?
You know if Uncle Phil's in a good mood?
I'm trying to hit him up for $50 for the homecoming.
Will, $50 is only gonna cover the tickets.
There's still the tux, the limousine the pre-party party, the post-party party, and, in your case, bail.
Yeah, you're right.
This could cost a fortune.
That's okay.
Daddy's got a fortune.
I always find that when you ask for large sums, it helps if you take his hand look deep into his eyes, and tell him you have cramps.
That only worked for Hilary.
When I tried it he sent me to a specialist.
Thanks a lot.
I think I can handle this myself, guys.
Compliment his clothes, you know?
Tell him that he's lost some weight.
But no more than 20 pounds, and it helps to keep a straight face.
Why don't I just get on my hands and knees and beg?
Well, that's only worth $25.
Besides, it's really hard on your knees.
Thanks, I really appreciate that, but I think I can handle this myself, guys.
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Man, you've lost weight.
Thanks a lot, Will.
And that suit you got on man, it's great how it accentuates your massive weight loss, man.
Anything else?
Yeah, there is one other thing.
I got cramps.
How much?
What's it cost?
And will I get sued?
Actually, now that you mention it, I could use, like, $200 for the homecoming.
Well, fine.
I'll write you a check.
You know, Will, I never thought I'd say this but you've become like one of my own.
I could close my eyes, and I'd swear I'm talking to Carlton.
Hi, Will.
Are you all right?
Well, Uncle Phil just said that I was just like one of your kids.
He said I was just like He said I was just like your son.
And you are, sweetheart.
And it's about time he realized it.
I bet you are going to win first place.
Yeah, this volcano's going to be the coolest thing at the science fair.
Where should we put the tiny missionaries with the shocked expressions on their faces?
Anywhere.
When the lava flows, it's every missionary for himself.
Whoa!
Look at that guy in the swimsuit.
Is he buffed or what?
Where?
I don't see a buffed guy.
I only see Carlton.
Oh, God.
He's coming over here.
I can't look.
Hand me a missionary.
Hey, Ashley, how's the science project coming?
It's going great.
Carlton, this is Tina.
Tina, this is my brother, Carlton.
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi.
I love your towel.
Thanks.
Well, I got to go prepare for debate practice.
You're on the debate team?
That is so cool.
I must say it is refreshing to see the younger generation taking an interest in the art of persuasion.
It's my favorite extracurricular activity, next to table tennis.
You're athletic, too?
I should have known by your bulging forearms.
They do draw stares.
Man, I thought a dip in the pool was gonna cool me off.
I'm blazing about what Uncle Phil said to me.
I'm sure when he called you a sophomoric cretin it was just a figure of speech.
No, that didn't bother me.
It's when he said I was just like Carlton.
Yes, I can understand your concern.
- Sandwich?
- Yeah, sure.
See, now, look, I know where I come from, man.
I mean, I'm coming straight out of Philly, man, and I'm proud of that.
- Could you put that on a croissant for me?
- Certainly.
You know, Master William, we all change.
Hey, look, man, I haven't changed, I'm not gonna change and I'm not down with this bourgeois stuff.
- Swiss?
- No, Gorgonzola.
Hey, man, I'm telling you, if there is one dude in the world that's the total opposite of Carlton, it's this guy standing right here, man.
Hey, thanks a lot, G. Yo, man, how you gonna play a brother on the Grey Poupon?
Geoffrey, I'm famished.
Can you make me a Gorgonzola sandwich on a croissant, heavy on the Grey Poupon?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Uncle Phil is right, G. I'm turning into Carlton.
All right, that's it.
No more of these sissy sandwiches.
No more valet parking and no more of these preppy parties, man.
And that homecoming?
No, you can kill that noise.
I'm gonna call Cindy right now, and I'm gonna tell her the whole thing is off.
And this check that Uncle Phil gave me?
Now you see it, now you don't.
Yo, the funky Fresh is back in the flesh with a vengeance, homes.
Hey, I'm gonna eat that though.
But I ain't gonna enjoy it.
Come on, kids!
Tip-off's in 30 minutes!
Carlton, you seen my keys?
- Excuse me, what did you call me?
- I called you Will.
No, you didn't.
You called me Carlton.
I'm not Carlton, okay?
I don't look like Carlton.
I don't act like Carlton and, most importantly, I don't look like Carlton.
Can we discuss this in the car?
I don't want to be late.
Yeah, you remember what happened last time?
They ran out of pasta salad in the VIP section.
And they didn't, like, stop the game?
Aunt Viv, I'm sorry.
I'm just not down with this b-ball thing at least not the way y'all do it.
Then I take it you won't be going to the game?
I didn't exactly say that.
What I was saying is that I'm just not down with it the way you guys do it.
If I do it, I want to sit in the $2 seats where my feet be sticking to the floor and a big, fat, crusty, bloated dude is sitting behind me belching in my ear.
I mean, any other way is unnatural.
Miss Cindy Norris.
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, what's up, baby?
I am so excited about going to the game.
Do you think they're gonna have that great pasta salad?
Hey, look, baby, the plans have kind of been changed a little bit.
Yeah, I hope you brought rubber shoes.
Let's go, Dad.
We're gonna be late.
Yeah, last time they ran out of pasta salad.
Will, are you gonna go with us or not?
I'm sorry.
Look, that's just not my style, Uncle Phil.
I'm not riding in no Benz.
We'll just take Cindy's Miata.
Come here, baby.
I need to talk to you.
Look, you know, about this homecoming thing look, I know I said we were gonna go with Carlton and his date but things have changed.
Will, you are so wonderful.
Man, you take bad news better than anybody I ever met.
I think it's really romantic that you want to have me all to yourself.
Wait, hold on.
See, that ain't exactly it.
I am so excited about homecoming.
Do you know I worked 80 extra hours just so I could pay for my dress?
But it is so cute, you're gonna love it.
It's cut very low in the front.
I wonder if it shows too much cleavage.
About how many corsages you gonna be needing?
Tina, we need to talk.
Carlton, those khaki pants make you look so Field and Stream.
Take me camping.
Tina, I'm at my wit's end.
Look, it's bad enough you call me every hour on the hour when I'm home but I don't appreciate being paged at school.
I'm so sorry.
I try to sound official.
Well, I don't think anyone believed you were Colin Powell.
It's obvious there could never be anything between us.
Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
- Yes, Carlton, I do.
- Good.
- I'm gonna go study now.
- Studying?
That is so cool.
- Are you going to highlight or underline?
- None of your beeswax!
Hey, you know, Ashley, that's beautiful.
I think those two are a match made in midget heaven.
Will, are you coming to the science fair to see me do my volcano presentation?
Look, I'm sorry, Ash.
I'd like to, but I can't.
- Why not?
- I got a job.
Yeah, right, and I can't go, either.
A dog ate my volcano.
No, I'm serious.
I'm waiting tables at Treasure Island.
I want to pay for the homecoming.
You couldn't lie to Daddy about his weight, either?
No, look, Ash, that's just not my style, you know?
I'm a man.
I want to pay my own way.
I'm gonna save up the money.
I'm gonna show Uncle Phil what I'm made of.
That's great, Will.
He's gonna be really proud of you.
Yeah, I know.
But until I get the money we gotta keep this a secret, all right?
I won't tell.
No, Tina.
I don't care if you can get in for half price.
I'm not taking you to see Jungle Fever!
"Most Promising Future Scientist".
This is incredible, Ashley.
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.
It means I'll never have to see Tina again.
Miss Tina.
Hi, Carlton.
I know you told me to buzz off, but I just had to see you one more time.
Tina, you've got to get over me.
It's time you got on with your life.
I'm no good for you.
Now, I want you to walk out that door, hop on your bike, and pedal like hell.
Okay, Carlton.
If that's what you want.
Bye.
Tina, we were just about to take Ashley out to dinner to celebrate your award.
- Would you like to join us?
- Lf I can sit by Carlton.
I better go call my mom.
I might as well face it.
I'm irresistible to women.
Now I know what Tom Jones feels like.
Vivian, take a look at this.
Will's basketball coach says he hasn't been to practice all week.
His English teacher called and said he's been falling asleep in class.
- And he missed curfew twice this week.
- By my count it was four times.
But I'll go check my videotape.
Will, we have to talk.
Yeah, sure, Uncle Phil.
What's the problem?
You missed basketball practice.
You've been falling asleep in class and you missed curfew twice this week.
I want an explanation.
And you deserve an explanation.
All right?
And I have an incredible one that I'd like to give you next week.
But then again, I'd like to see next week so maybe I should give it to you now.
I got a job.
- Why are we just now hearing about it?
- I wanted to surprise you.
Look, I wasn't born yesterday.
I expect you to honor your commitments, and I expect you to be honest.
Now, until you can tell me the truth, you are grounded.
No TV, no phone calls, and no visitors.
But Why don't you just do me like Kunta Kente and chop off my foot?
Now I know you're angry, but I think you may have overreacted.
Vivian, you don't expect me to condone his behavior.
Baby, I know that falling asleep is not a good thing.
But your own secretary has said that she's had to nudge you awake after you've had Mexican food.
Only after the El Presidente Platter.
And he should go to practice, but it is an extracurricular activity.
It's a lot like you going to the gym, and, as I recall, the last time you were there I think the Jeffersons were still trying to move on up.
That's different.
I'm starting back Monday.
And I do not approve of his breaking curfew, but I think that you should Vivian, you've made your point.
I'll let him give an explanation.
Ashley, sweetie, would you go upstairs and tell Will his uncle and I would like to speak with him, please?
Will's not here.
I just saw him leave on his bike.
You see that, Vivian?
Outright defiance.
That boy just does whatever he wants to, and I am sick of it!
This just doesn't seem like Will.
Vivian, can we just drop the subject and go have dinner?
Look, Philip, I know that I don't have all the facts but if Will says he has a job, I believe him.
Vivian, you are so naive.
You'd believe that boy if he were to tell you he was a big rap star whose album just went platinum.
Ashley, sweetheart, what an interesting choice of restaurants.
It's so piratesque.
Welcome to the briny deep, where none of our prices are ever too steep.
We've got fresh fish.
You can look in our tank.
To get to the bathroom, make a left at the plank.
Follow me.
Get a load of his costume.
You couldn't pay me to wear an outfit like that.
I think you'll be needing a booster seat, little boy.
Vivian, let's not let Will ruin our dinner.
He hasn't ruined anything for me.
I think he's a great kid.
Complimentary champagne for the lovely young lady.
- I'll have a glass of that, too.
- Sorry, man, we ain't got no more.
Would you likes to order before I bring you back the menus?
- I'll have an iced tea, please.
- Perrier with a twist of lemon.
I don't know.
I just can't seem to decide.
Well, sir, we've got all three flavors of Slim-Fast.
I'll have a cola, wise guy.
That waiter has been exceedingly discourteous.
I can't put my finger on it, but the way he treats me reminds me of someone.
Well, I think the waiter's really nice, and I bet he's really honest, too.
I like his eye patch, makes him look kind of dangerous.
You know, table tennis isn't exactly safe.
Thank you for my iced tea.
You are really fast, reliable, and trustworthy.
I really like your beard.
Tina, I doubt if it's real, and there's a French-fry in it.
Waiter?
This soda's flat.
Aye, you don't say, sir.
- Try that.
- Well, that does it.
You are the rudest, most incompetent waiter I've ever met.
I'm not a waiter.
According to my uncle, I don't even have a job.
Vivian, I think I've made a mistake.
So have I. Carlton, you were my third love, and I'll never forget you but I like Will now.
He's dressed like an idiot, and he's still so cool.
He's not the only guy who can dress like an idiot.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Look, I'm human.
Sometimes I make mistakes.
Now, I admit I had some preconceived ideas about you mainly that you just didn't care about anything.
But I guess I'm gonna have to let that go, because today you've shown me that you are a very, very fine young man and I just want us to be closer together.
What did you say, pervert?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I Look, man, this is Treasure Island, okay?
Now, Pleasure Island, that's a block down the street.
- I thought - No, I know what you thought but if you'll notice, the parrot is sitting on my left shoulder.
I feel like a fool.
Yeah, wait till they make you bob for your lobster.
By any chance, did you hear anything of what I just said?
No, I didn't.
Look, it's hard for me to apologize.
It's hard for me to dress up in this stupid costume, but I do it.
I don't get it, Will.
Why the job?
I just wanted to pay for the homecoming myself.
- But I gave you a check.
- I tore it up.
Why?
'Cause you were right, Uncle Phil.
Man, I'm getting soft.
I'm a man, and a man should be able to stand on his own two feet make his own way, like you did.
I mean, a man does it for himself.
It's a hard road to travel, but after you travel it and you look back on what you accomplished, you can say, "I did that.
I'm a man".
That's the biggest load of bull I've heard since I left the farm.
Nobody does anything without help, Will.
People opened doors for me, and I've worked hard to open doors for you.
It doesn't make you any less of a man to walk through them.
I never really looked at it like that.
You know, Uncle Phil?
I guess it ain't so bad being like one of your kids.
Thank you.
Of course, if I had my choice, I'd pick Ashley but Well Can't touch this.
English
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Will!
This place is a pit.
You better clean it up before Mom and Dad get home.
It's cool, max out, Hil, they won't be home for hours.
They're here.
Nighty-night.
Hi, Aunt Viv.
I didn't hear you pull up.
Where's Uncle Phil?
He's out back, turning on the sprinklers.
Will!
- Another crumpet, Cecil?
- Perhaps just one.
- My compliments to your cook.
- Actually, I baked them myself.
You don't say?
A butler having to do the baking?
I'm sorry, it's just a butler having to cook is rather like a butler having to clean.
Yo, what's up, the butler posse?
Yo, C, you looking buffed, man.
What, you been pumping iron?
I do what I can, homes.
Care to join us in a spot of tea and crumpets, Master William?
No, that's all right, I'm driving later, man.
Y'all go ahead and get busy without me.
None of that sniffing furniture polish, all right?
Just say no.
Thank goodness the Crandolfs only have poodles.
At least I don't have to follow him around with a pooper-scooper.
By the way, did I tell you, the Crandolfs have expanded my wing?
The spa is really quite lovely.
Well, I have a Jacuzzi.
You mean those foaming bath tablets they gave you last Christmas?
They're quite exhilarating if you sit directly on them.
Did I mention that the Crandolfs have installed a wonderful new home-entertainment center for me?
The Banks have just given me a fabulous new television set with quadraphonic sound, remote control and a satellite dish.
Hey, yo, G. Can I borrow your new TV, man?
- Certainly, Master William, it's in my suite.
- No, it ain't, G. It's right here.
Buy a vowel, you moron.
Buy a vowel!
What are you gunning for?
Pass it!
If I were you, Will, I'd be more concerned with passing the PSATs.
Yeah, and if I were you I'd get a red nose and a set of big floppy shoes, and call it a day.
Laugh now, but in 10 years I'll be a successful lawyer and you'll be asking people if they want extra ketchup.
If you paid attention in class, like I do you'd know you can't study for an aptitude test.
You either have it or you don't.
Yeah, right, and in kindergarten they told me it didn't make a difference where you put the round peg.
Next thing I knew I was in the back of the class with a guy who ate paste.
Never again.
I'm studying all weekend.
Carlton, that is not normal, man.
What kind of fool works night and day?
Boy, do I have a lot of work to do this weekend.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Like I was saying, Carlton, a wise man knows the value of hard work.
Look, Dad, I just went through my practice PSAT test again.
I just shaved seven seconds off my time.
Whoa, Nelly.
Very good, Carlton.
You're gonna get a gold star on your chart right next to "put away toys" and "stay dry through the night".
Philip, Geoffrey's annual raise is coming up and I think we should discuss it.
We won't bring it up until he does.
Madam, sir I have just taken the liberty of rotating your tires re-grouting the pool and drawing up plans for a small gazebo.
I hope it is to your satisfaction.
I think he just brought it up.
Carlton, will you quit?
Quit: From the Latin, quietare, to be at rest or satisfied.
He's been doing this all morning.
It's really irritating.
Irritate: From the Latin, irritare, to excite or stimulate.
- Okay, Carlton, that's enough.
- Vivian, his PSATs are this morning.
He's just trying to be prepared.
Prepare: From the Latin, praeparare, to make ready.
Carlton, shut up.
Shut up: From the big guy, your father.
Come on, Viv, come on.
Come on.
- Is this how you prepare for a test?
- Well, yeah, sort of.
See, what it was is we're gonna be sitting down for a lot of hours so I just thought I'd do something to get my blood flowing.
Come on, Will, we better get going.
I want to get there early so I can get my pick of the pencils.
Before you go, son, I have a little surprise for you.
It's my old Princeton sweatshirt.
I was gonna save it until you went off to college, but I thought you might like to have it today.
Dad, I don't know what to say.
This means so much to me.
I'll wear it for good luck.
Or you could throw it up in the air and cover that big hole in the ozone.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Geoffrey.
We wanted to discuss your annual raise.
In light of your exemplary service over this past year I'd like to offer you an additional $20 a week.
I'm sorry?
I thought you said $20 per week.
- I did.
- Very well.
Dinner at 7:00 as usual, sir?
Of course that's not all, Geoffrey.
Of course not, sir.
I really didn't think so.
Why don't you treat yourself to a new uniform, on me.
Thank you, sir, you're most kind.
And with my newfound wealth I can treat myself to a Happy Meal.
Junk mail, bills, PSAT scores, bills.
Man.
- Did you say "PSAT scores"?
- Yeah.
- Give me those.
- Yo, beat it, man.
- Come on, Will.
- Yo, beat it, man.
Will.
Who's the most handsome guy in the world?
You are, Will.
And who's the biggest weenie on the planet for $400?
I am.
Give me those.
Man, I don't care what these scores say.
You're a dumb young man.
Yes!
Mom!
Dad!
I got a 114 on the PSATs.
I'm smart.
I'm brilliant.
I'm the most intelligent person who ever lived.
- That is fantastic, baby.
- Son, I'm so proud of you.
Will, why don't you open yours?
I got a 91.
Carlton, that's enough.
A 91 is a very good reason why you should take this test again, Will.
I'd be happy to help you out.
I am in the 90th percentile.
Let's see that.
You said you got a 114?
You got a 116.
That's impossible.
Hold it, the 91 must be my percentile.
But then, that means that I'm the most intelligent guy in the world.
You know, Carlton, you're gonna love driving those big rigs, man.
Mom, make him stop.
You can have my job, Master Carlton.
I quit.
I don't believe it.
You couldn't have done better than me.
Somewhere there's an Asian Will Smith and he's really ticked.
Carlton, it was one measly little percentile point, all right?
But I won't hesitate to throw it in your face if you don't leave me alone.
Everyone still knows I have the superior intellect.
Then why are you using car wax on the window?
This a window, this is Windex.
Can you say that, little boy?
Daddy, Geoffrey wouldn't just quit.
What did you do to him?
Ashley, I'm just glad you didn't have to see him leave.
There was a tear in his eye as he walked down the driveway took one last look at us, and gave a sad little wave.
And fortunately you're too young to know what he was waving.
I can't wait to be grown up.
That grocery store was a snake pit.
I almost got thrown out of the express line for being one item over the limit.
You'd be surprised how fast you can eat a sponge cake when you have to.
Vivian, Hilary's going to fix us a lovely meal.
Well, Mama Celeste and Uncle Ben do deserve some credit.
You know, it's hot in here with that oven on.
What do you think?
It's like 91?
Or a measly little 90?
I'm telling you, Will, it was a computer error.
I'll bet anything.
About what?
About $91?
Laundry's done.
Thank you, Ashley, it was sweet of you to help out.
My everything is so pink.
Carlton baby, would you put the mustard in the refrigerator, please?
I know what you're implying.
You don't think I can cut the mustard, do you?
You think I'm not as smart as Will.
You think just because he did better on the exam that he's a better person.
Sweetheart, that's ridiculous.
Carlton, now Will's just teasing.
- We all think you did really good.
- Good?
That's just another way of saying I stink, isn't it?
Maybe I have hit a little slump, but I'm sure even Albert Einstein had a bad day.
God knows he never combed his hair.
The point is other great minds have faced adversity and it made them all the better.
And I, too, shall overcome.
Well, I won't.
Not without Geoffrey.
Philip, we have got to get him back and I don't care if we have to beg.
Yeah, Daddy.
I don't get down on my knees and beg to anyone.
Oh, no!
But I'm not adverse to sitting up and begging.
Admit it, Will, I beat you in gym.
Okay, fine, Carlton, you got your shorts on way faster than me.
Right.
Of course, yours have a lot shorter distance to travel.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I've got this whole PSAT thing all figured out.
I was just nervous.
I lost my stride.
But now everything's back to normal, Carlton is back on top.
Good morning, class.
Today we're going to have a little pop quiz.
A quiz?
But, Coach Smiley, I didn't have a chance to study.
That's why they call it a pop quiz, Banks.
Anyway, pass these down.
You know the rules.
I'll be in the back, listening to the game.
Good luck, men.
My life is over.
I'll be expelled.
They'll send me away.
I'll have to get a Jheri curl and a tattoo.
I'll be subjected to over-crowding, bad food and daily threats of personal violence.
Carlton, I don't think they'll send you to prison for cheating on a test.
I'm not talking about prison.
I'm talking about public school.
Would you hold it together, Carlton?
Look, man, I'll get you through this.
But I tried to cheat off your paper.
What's in it for you?
Well, until someone proves otherwise, you are my cousin, man.
Look, sit down, here they come, follow my lead.
Hey, Dr. T, how you doing?
How's Carol and the kids?
- Fine, Will, and the knee?
- A lot better now.
Hey, I like what you've done with the office.
Thank you.
Carlton, I must say, I'm surprised to see you.
- What is this all about, Coach?
- All I know is this: I went through four years of school on a football scholarship and graduated with honors.
So I know a thing or two about cheating.
Carlton, I think it's time for you to come out of the closet.
Whoa!
Now there's no need for that in here, boys.
Coach, are you familiar with the sports injury cerebral-spinal-refrictionation?
Sure, I mean, isn't everyone?
Then you are familiar with how a refrictionation constrains the range of motion of the upper neck?
Sure, yeah, that's one symptom.
Then you know that a refrictionation is often brought on by some form of stress and it manifests itself in a compulsive craning of the neck.
Whoa, Carlton, you look like one's coming on now.
You don't happen to be feeling any stress now, do you?
No, I Yes, I think I feel it coming on.
Banks, I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
He's probably a little embarrassed, Coach.
I mean, as you can see, he looks like a complete idiot.
Well, that's very true.
You know, I think there seems to be just a big misunderstanding here.
I could have caught it myself if I hadn't been so involved in the game.
Did I say game?
I meant the crisis in the Soviet Union.
Dr. Thorvald, there is no cheating going on here.
This is obviously a case of cerebral-spinal Whatever he said.
You're dismissed, Banks.
Will, you did it.
You got me out of cheating.
Yes!
No!
There I was in the middle of an arbitration between two of my biggest clients and I get pulled out because Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid here want to pull a fast one.
Now, I want an explanation.
- Well, look, Uncle Phil - Be quiet.
Don't even look at me.
I cannot believe you boys.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Now, what do you think your punishment should be?
Yo, come on, man, that's a setup.
You are grounded until we can think of something worse to do to you.
Now move it.
Have you any idea what we're supposed to do right now?
You heard the man.
Get upstairs!
Come on, man.
Is everything all straightened up?
Geoffrey'll be here any minute.
There he is now.
We agreed, I will do the negotiating.
All right, but remember, play it cool.
He doesn't have to know that we're desperate.
- Good evening, Mr. And Mrs. Banks.
- Geoffrey, thank God!
- Miss Hilary.
Miss Ashley.
- It's been a nightmare here without you.
Geoffrey, we're so glad you could come.
Please sit.
Geoffrey, since you quit, Philip and I have been doing a lot of talking I might as well tell you right now I won't come back for a penny less than $80 more per week.
We'll give you $100 a week.
Thank you.
That's most generous.
But there is one more thing.
Of course there would be some perks, Geoffrey.
An extra week's vacation alternate weekends off, two nights a week off, and extra help for parties.
Thank you.
But that wasn't it.
What do you want?
A car?
A StairMaster?
A fax machine?
What?
I think I know what it is that Geoffrey wants and he deserves it.
Geoffrey I apologize for taking you for granted.
Thank you, sir.
That's all I require.
Unless you'd be willing to consider a full-time cook preferably Jamaican, with an incredible set of cookware.
You're pushing it, Geoffrey.
It was worth a try.
I'll get my things.
Welcome back.
Geoffrey, I'm so glad you're back.
I have this huge grape stain on my white cat suit.
That was pretty good, Vivian.
Of course, I might have given in on the Jamaican cook.
Let's get one thing straight here, I wear the cookware in this house.
Come in.
Busy, Will?
I was about to jet to the Riviera with Whitney Houston but since I'm grounded, I guess I can spare five or six months.
Will, I'm sorry I got you into trouble.
Hey, forget it, man.
I shouldn't have been ranking you on your test scores in the first place.
Why not?
You had a right to gloat.
I would have.
In fact, I would have gloated better than you did.
Ten times better.
Carlton, please, come on, man.
This competition thing has got to stop.
All right?
You a smart dude.
You don't need a test to tell you that.
Yes, I do.
Carlton, look, I beat you by one stinking lousy point.
I mean that's just because I'm down with this math thing.
Hey, you stomped me on the verbal section.
- You're a lot more - Articulate, eloquent, erudite?
No, wordy.
Now, look, Carlton, there's a lot of things that you do better than me.
Like what?
I don't know, Carlton, you get straight A's and posture, you got great posture and you tie a tie real good.
True.
I am a much better dresser than you and I speak better, and I drive better and people definitely like me a whole lot more.
Looks like my work's done here.
Good night, Carlton.
And my manners are vastly superior to yours and when it comes to personal hygiene, God knows, there's no comparison.
You know, Carlton, there's one other thing you do great, man.
There is?
What?
You irritate the hell out of me!
Now, get out of my room!
Thanks, Will.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
It's Willsenio Smith!
Tonight, on The Willsenio Smith Show a boy making a videotape for his mama.
Give it up for him.
Hi, Mom, it's me.
You know, Aunt Viv told me that you finally came into the '90s, and you bought a VCR.
So I thought I'd make a little tape for you.
Well, I've grown a little bit since you've seen me, about an inch and a half.
Check this out, I got some chest hairs now.
Look.
See?
Digger One there.
Oh, that must have been sweater lint.
Well, anyway, hold up.
We'll be right back after these messages.
Have you ever felt, you know, not so fresh?
No, just kidding, Mama.
Hold on, check it out.
Got an A+ on my Spanish test.
Man, muchos brainos en el cabeza, si?
Man.
But, yo, I better vámonos 'cause you know how Uncle Phil gets if anybody hold up dinner.
Will!
That means, "How much is the espadrilles"?
Hey, yo.
I don't know how to say, "I miss you, Mom".
But I do.
All right.
Adiós.
Oh, cut it, Ash.
Hilary, your makeup's here.
No, it's one of your friends from Philly, too cheap to buy an airline ticket.
No, this is my new exercise bike.
I'm gonna use it to develop my huge legs.
You know, I figure I'll need them to support my massive chest and my 24-inch pythons.
This equal-opportunity thing has gone just a little too far.
I can't believe they're letting girls play on my intramural baseball team.
Next thing you know, they'll be letting us vote.
Don't even get me started on that issue.
Women have their place, but men are the cornerstone of civilization.
Not only are we good at men-things, but we're good at women-things, too.
I can't believe you're serious.
Hilary and I could do a so-called man-thing a lot better than either of you could do a so-called woman-thing.
Would you care to place a little wager?
I bet you couldn't Assemble an exercise bike.
Oh, my goodness.
We got one right here!
Well, we could do that a lot better than you could Sew a dress.
I saw it on The Brady Bunch.
You're on.
Another planet, man.
I ain't sewing no dress.
In other words, you can't sew no dress.
Well, what?
Are you crazy?
We'd do a dress like that.
And that includes a full smocking and smart pleat.
Then it's set.
The loser has to help Alice in the kitchen.
I mean Geoffrey.
- Hi, Ed.
- Evening.
Well, is Grandma here yet?
How does she look?
If I was 50 years old I'd definitely take her out for a bucket of chicken.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, baby.
Your mother loves her room.
She's been clapping the lights on and off for the last 20 minutes.
Ever since Grandpa died last year I've been trying to get Grandma to move out here with us.
So I want everybody to cheer her up.
I don't want her moping around in some old housecoat all day.
- Zeke.
- Mama.
- It's so good to see you, baby.
- Mama.
You look so fluorescent.
Don't I though?
I am three pounds lighter, a whole lot tighter and I'm dressed to chill.
Go, Granny.
Well, Mama, I've got a busy day planned for you tomorrow.
They're having a solitaire tournament out at the Bide-Away Retirement Villas and after that there's a pudding buffet.
Sounds like fun, but I don't think I can take all that excitement.
Hey, hold up.
I don't know, Granny.
Last week they served tapioca.
Man, the cops had to break that joint up.
Mrs. Banks, I bought all the fixings for a North-Carolina dinner.
Geoffrey, I'm impressed.
But while you're cooking it, would you mind making me up a salad?
I'm slimming.
Mama?
- You mean you're not cooking at all?
- Well, you know Okay, you basset hounds.
If you leave me to it, I can bake a pie and still get in a bike ride before supper.
Now, go on.
Get out of here.
Get away.
Shoo.
Go, Granny.
Evening.
Evening.
Yo, what up, Ed?
Granny, have you two met?
This is Mr. Ed Downer.
Ed, this is Mrs. Hattie Banks.
A woman known far and wide for her mean sweet-potato pies.
Well, if it's half as sweet as she is, maybe you might save me a slice.
Yeah, that's a good line, Ed.
I'll have to use that one myself.
Well, Ed, are you from around these parts?
No, my wife passed, my daughter wanted me out here and wouldn't take no for an answer.
Since my Joe passed, my son wants me out here, too.
But I don't think so.
Don't let this jogging suit fool you.
I'm no spring chicken.
Well, maybe not but you a long way from the stewing pot.
You know, like my dad always said: "Women are like Cadillacs "they don't even begin to rev up until they hit 70".
Yo, E. Another dope line, man.
We're gonna win this bet, Will.
I love the neckline, and the fabric's great.
And the color really brings out my eyes.
How are you doing, Granny?
What do you think?
Six years of Oprah, and this is still a shock.
It's a bet, Grandma.
Don't tell me what happens if you lose.
In fact, I don't want to know what happens if you win.
Oh, hell, just let's never mention it again.
Son?
And I use that term loosely.
What's going on?
Dad, it's not what it looks like.
Will and I are making a dress.
That's exactly what it looks like.
Look, Carlton, let's just go upstairs and pick out some accessories, man.
Work it, honey.
Seat.
Handlebars.
Pedals.
Hey, we're doing great.
Give me.
"Tools needed: Pliers and a wrench with a ratchet head".
Sounds like somebody with a bad haircut.
What else?
Oh, goody!
Listen to this: "Do not overexert yourself or work to exhaustion".
We have to stop, Ashley.
Oh, no, Carlton.
Carlton, man.
Is this the saddest sight that you've seen, man?
Other than your girlfriend in biker shorts?
We are doing just fine, thank you.
As a matter of fact, as soon as we put it together, we'll be done.
When did you see my girlfriend in bicycle shorts?
Last Thursday, while she was playing tennis.
Magnificent server.
Speaking of serving, your parents are expecting you on the patio for brunch.
Mama, we'd like you to meet our next-door neighbor.
Mrs. Sweeting, this is my mother, Mrs. Banks.
Thanks?
For what?
I just got here.
How do you do?
Yes, well, we had a nice long chat while we were walking up the driveway and it seems you two gals have a lot in common.
Oh, isn't that nice?
What?
I crochet.
I play cards.
Did I mention I crochet?
Excuse me, I just remembered I have some pantyhose soaking upstairs.
Mrs. Sweeting, may I ask what you're making?
An afghan.
That's what I make, afghans, only afghans.
Not scarves, not tablecloths, not doilies.
I think I'll go translate the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Well, I'll go with you.
You can never learn that stuff too early.
While you two ladies get acquainted I think I'll go check and see what Geoffrey's doing in the kitchen.
Bitchin'?
Is he going surfing?
I thought we were gonna have lunch.
Well, I wish I could stay.
It's so nice getting to know your friends but Will and I have to go - Bungee jumping.
- Oh, that's right.
Nice meeting you, Miss Sweet Thing.
Come on, honey.
Philip, I'll be out in a minute.
I have slipped into something that will knock your socks off.
My socks are already off.
Just come out naked.
Well, what do you think?
What's that?
After 22 years of marriage you still have to ask?
No, dear, I'm talking about this note here.
"Dear Vivian and Zeke, I'm going over to my new friend's to play cards".
"Love, Mama".
Your mother went over to Mrs. Sweeting's?
I don't believe it.
- I hate to say I told you so.
- Then don't.
Help me turn down the bed instead.
I mean, why shouldn't they hit it off?
They're both about the same age.
So are you and Mick Jagger.
Philip, can I help you with your shirt?
You know, the important thing is, Mama's got a new friend now.
Philip, your mother is fine.
She really, really is.
Stop worrying.
And this nightgown cost $160.
No, she's not fine.
Believe me, Vivian, this chipper act is strictly for my benefit.
I'm gonna wait up for Mama and see if she needs anything before she goes to bed.
Philip.
There's something I'd like before I go to bed.
I'll bring you some sugar cookies.
God, this dress-making is a breeze, isn't it, Will?
You said it, Carlton.
Hey, man, what do you think of this for Cher?
It's a little formal, isn't it?
Not only are men bad at sewing, they're also terrible liars.
- Hey, what do you know about men?
- A lot more than you know about women.
When was the last time you called a girl for a date a week in advance showed up in a nice suit with a bouquet of flowers and took her out for a romantic, candle-lit meal?
Never.
Come on, look, women don't like that mushy stuff.
They like a man to take control.
Yeah, control of themselves.
A guy's idea of an icebreaker is sitting next to me in the cafeteria and belching my name.
There's nothing like love to build up a good appetite.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Slugabed.
- Hi, honey.
- Good morning, Mama.
I fixed your favorite, pecan waffles.
No, thank you, Mother.
I'm not very hungry this morning for some reason.
How was it when you were growing up, Grandma?
When I was your age, sweetheart, there was no hanky-panky.
Not at my age, either.
Although I don't think there's anything the matter with a little hugging and kissing.
Could we change the subject, please?
Zeke, are you feeling okay?
Your face is longer than Arsenio Hall's.
- I'm fine.
- Well, he tossed and turned all night.
Or was that me?
Look, I'm fine.
Can we just eat, please?
Hattie, thank you for making breakfast.
You know, you were out so late last night, I thought you would sleep in.
Honey, I've been going to bed with the chickens all of my life.
But, you know, when you're out having a good time the last thing you think about is the bed.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know what's gotten into Dad but if he's dieting again, I'm moving to a hotel.
Philip?
You've been acting strange all day.
Now, if it's about last night, I am not upset anymore.
No, that's not it.
Why isn't it?
Mama wasn't playing cards with Mrs. Sweeting last night.
She was out with Ed, the handyman.
I saw them kissing good night.
Sweetheart, I understand why you're upset but your parents had a long, wonderful marriage.
But your mother's been alone for almost a year now.
Can you imagine how lonely she must be?
If she's found someone, can't you just be happy for her?
No.
Philip, think about it.
If you die tomorrow, what would you want me to do?
Jump in with me and bring the kids.
- You don't mean that.
- You're right.
Leave the kids.
Philip, if you want your mother to move to California that means accepting her friends.
Now, I think it would be a nice gesture to invite Ed to dinner.
- You've got to be kidding.
- Philip.
I know it's hard to be rational and mature when it comes to dealing with your own mother, but please try.
I don't want to.
Please, baby, for me.
If I promise to jump in with you?
Philip, Hattie's friend has been here almost an hour.
Eventually, you are gonna have to say something to him.
Like what?
Nice suit.
Pass the salt.
What's your favorite wrench?
Anything.
Honey, as long as it's to Ed.
- Can you do that for me, please?
- I'll try.
Just wait until you've tasted Geoffrey's ham-hock soufflé.
Why don't you sit here Mr Ed?
It's Downer, sweetie, Mr. Ed Downer.
Something sure does smell delicious.
That would be Granny.
So, Ed, Hattie tells us that you grew up on a farm.
That's right, a horse farm.
My daddy had a horse.
Mr. Downer, what breed did you raise?
Appaloosas.
They have the most beautiful spotted coats.
My dad had a spotted coat, then he had it cleaned.
Did you have any other animals on your farm?
Of course, we had chickens, cows, and a great old dog named Brownie.
My dad loved brownies.
He once ate a whole pan-full.
That explains a lot.
So what happened to your farm?
My son's there.
I passed it on to him, like my dad got it from his parents.
My dad had parents.
We called them Grandmom and Grandpop.
Zeke, honey, it smells like my dessert is ready.
Would you go check on it for me, please?
Smells like sweet-potato pie.
- My dad liked - Sweet-potato pie!
You miss your father a lot, don't you, Zeke?
- Somebody has to.
- What do you mean by that?
I was standing right there.
I saw you kiss Ed good night, and now he's sitting in my daddy's place.
You're the one who invited him to dinner and I'm glad you did.
Don't you feel anything for Daddy, anything at all?
You really want to know how I feel?
I'll tell you.
- I'm angry, Zeke.
- Angry?
Why, Mama?
Because he promised he'd never leave me.
Crazy as it may seem, I believed him.
One morning last month, I woke up early went downstairs singing got a big breakfast on the stove.
Suddenly, I realized I was the only one there to eat it.
Remembering is easy, Zeke.
It's the times that I forget he's gone that I can't stand.
Oh, Mama, I am so sorry.
It's just that I lost Daddy and when I saw you with Ed, I thought I was gonna lose you, too.
You're not gonna lose me, Zeke.
Of course you may have to loan me out on occasion.
You can let go now, Zeke.
As soon as Ed leaves.
This is perfection.
You'll notice the smooth motion, graceful lines, and elegant style.
And the bike looks great, too.
Will, you have to admit, Hilary and I have built the perfect exercise bike while Carlton is probably upstairs, trying to unstitch your dress from some major body parts.
She who laughs last.
Carlton, if you please.
Carlton Banks is wearing an elegant, yet masculine, cotton-silk combination designed by Will St. Le Carlton.
Well, what do you think?
Baby, come to Mama.
You want some fries with that shake?
Honey, you can carry my lunchbox home anytime.
Hey, man, you gonna let them talk to you like that?
Yeah, I kind of like it.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hi, Mom.
So what's my little man working so hard at?
This math, but this can wait.
You're only gonna be out here a few days.
No, don't worry about it.
I'll entertain myself.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute, baby.
- Blow.
- Mom, what are you doing?
I said blow.
Good boy.
- Come on, Mom.
- Sorry.
You know what, Mom?
I can do this later.
Why don't we go somewhere, have some fun?
Fun?
William, you gotta learn how to concentrate.
Now your schoolwork comes before anything else.
Will.
Now keep studying.
Put the champagne over there, then go out and help set up the tables.
And if you value your tip, stop looking at my behind.
I can't believe my baby sister's getting married.
I can.
I just paid the florist.
Philip, all you ever think about is money.
No.
That's not true, Vivian.
Sometimes I think about other things.
Would you two knock it off?
You're married.
It's time you start acting like it.
Viola, this is why I got married.
Mother, please.
It's the '90s.
I mean, a woman doesn't have to be married to Like, I read about it, okay?
- Where do you want these?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Lady, don't you know any other words?
- No.
I'm sorry.
Pea-green patio chairs?
I don't think so.
This is not a Ninja-Turtle wedding.
Do I have to do everything myself?
Miss Hilary, the day you do everything for yourself will be the day I square-dance naked on the White-House lawn.
Do we have a safety deposit box?
I wanna hide my things before Aunt Helen and Uncle Lester get here with Bobby.
Ashley, your cousin Bobby is not that bad.
Mom, last time he came here he pulled off Barbie's arm and burnt down her Dream House.
Now, Bobby, don't attack the squirrel.
I'm out of here.
Hey.
Hi, everybody.
How are you?
- Baby!
- Here you are, sweet boy.
Oh, my!
Is this the Banks' house or Buckingham Palace?
Hey, big sister Vi.
You got a boyfriend yet?
Now ain't no point in saving nothing these days.
You hear what I'm saying?
The whole neighborhood hears what you saying.
Helen, I see you still haven't come out of your shell.
Vivian, girl, you look good.
And you've lost weight in all the right places.
Philip, you look good.
And you look good.
Where's Carlton?
Bobby, covering a person's eyes when they're driving is not a very wise thing to do.
And don't ever call me a weenie-face in public again.
Well, we're in private now, weenie-face.
Carlton, take the luggage upstairs.
You three will sleep in Carlton's room, and Carlton will sleep in Will's room.
I want to sleep with Carlton.
I always dreamt when I heard those words it would be Paula Abdul saying them.
Lester, how about a little NFL action?
Man, I take all the action I can get.
Yo, look who I found at the airport.
Divas.
Baby girl!
How are you doing?
Wait a minute.
Now where is the groom?
Frank is coming in the morning.
He had to take care of some business.
Oh, yes.
Speaking of taking care of business, does he?
Forever is a long time, sister.
- Not in front of Will, please.
- Viola, wake up.
Will is 17 years old.
He's probably taking care of a little business himself.
Aren't you, Will?
Absolutely not!
Vivian, Frank and I appreciate you giving us this wedding on such short notice.
- I want you to be my matron of honor.
- Of course I will.
And guess who's gonna be the best man, naturally.
Will?
Y'all don't know?
Hey, I did teach her how to burp on command.
And I did teach you how to dance.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hold on.
Look out.
Hold on, Aunt Janice.
Hold up.
That was, like, 10 years ago.
I'm, like, light-years ahead of you now.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, Aunt Janice.
I am so happy.
Look at the size of this rock.
- Oh, Gibraltar is a mole hill.
- Right.
Later on this afternoon, you ladies can go skating on it.
Well, isn't this something?
The Smith sisters are together again.
- Yes, we are.
- The good, the bad, and the Don't even try it.
You need a pedicure.
Yeah, I would crack on your feet, but they don't reach all the way up here.
Will do you want to get married?
All right, that's it.
Get out of my bed!
Not to me, you pervert.
I'm sorry, man.
This is LA.
Well, I'm definitely getting married, and I want my wife to be a virgin.
Well, you better hurry up, man.
Mother Teresa ain't getting no younger.
My wife: The limber, but unspoiled Bridgetta.
She'll be an excellent homemaker and have the breasts the size of Australia.
I don't know, man.
I just can't imagine waking up to the same woman every day for the rest of my life no matter how big Australia is.
Come on, Will, you really don't want to get married?
I don't know, man.
Maybe one day.
You know, when I'm old and gray.
You know, around 29, 30 years old.
Heck, by then young Carlton will be interviewing for preschool and Carltonette will be a little croissant in the oven.
That's good.
Then they'll be able to baby-sit little Will, Wilma Williamina, Wilton, and Baby Willy.
Good night, Will.
- Carlton?
- Yeah?
Is that your feet, or did you break wind?
Sorry, Will.
Janice, I'm starting to get worried.
Shouldn't Frank be here by now?
Vivian, I know my sweetheart.
He'll be here because there's absolutely nothing else he would rather be doing today.
Carlton, come on, man.
It is not that serious.
I'm head usher and there's no one to seat.
I'll be all dressed up with absolutely nothing to do.
Just think of it as one of your dates.
All right, Bobby.
Sit and stay.
Carlton, it's your shift.
I'm going to get my tubes tied.
Cousin Carlton, tomorrow can you take me to Disneyland?
Forget it.
I will not be an accomplice to the murder of Mickey Mouse.
You know, Bobby, I love it when you come to visit, man.
They appreciate me so much more when you leave.
It's him.
I gotta go fix my makeup.
Mr. Frank Schaeffer.
Yes.
Welcome to our family.
I'm Vi.
I raised Janice, and looking at you, I know I raised her right.
- Those are the other two sisters.
- Oh, yes.
Cute, cute, cute, and cute.
A dangerous combination.
Why don't you come in, make yourself comfortable?
Your little woman will be down any minute.
Great.
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- Thanks.
Baby.
Hey, my brother, you gonna let her tip him like that?
Man, what does she do when y'all eat out?
Everybody, this is Frank.
Frank, this is everybody.
Come on, honey.
I'll show you to your room.
Excuse me, but what happened to the little lady y'all promised me?
Here's $5.
Go find your own.
Gee, when Janice described him she didn't mention that he was tall.
Not that I have any problem with people who are tall.
My cousin used to date a girl who was tall.
Heck, the boys go to a predominantly tall school.
Am I alone in this, or didn't y'all notice he was White?
What the hell is wrong with Janice?
I'm sorry, did I say white?
I meant tall.
He didn't seem that tall to me.
I do not want my sister marrying that man.
But Aunt J seems so happy.
Doesn't she?
I mean, and that's what we want for her.
Isn't it?
Happy, happy, happy?
- Vi, this is her decision.
- Let Janice do what she wants to do.
Well, she can do it without us.
Come on, Will.
Hey, wait, Mom.
Hold up.
Wait, I'm the best man.
Not anymore, you're not.
I said come on.
She breast-fed me.
- Vivian!
- You're in the dark.
What are you doing down here in the dark?
Well, I couldn't find the lights in this bowling alley you call a kitchen.
Well, I couldn't sleep, either.
I hope this wedding doesn't turn into a disaster.
Now, look I don't care if Frank is black, white, or candy-apple red.
I've been on Slim-Fast for the last two weeks to fit into my dress.
Now somebody's gonna marry somebody up in here.
The hell with it.
Start slicing up that ham.
Girl, this family has sure had its share of surprises.
Do you remember the last reunion when Uncle Rubin came out of the closet?
How could I forget?
He came out wearing my purple-leather suit.
I guess you guys couldn't sleep, either?
Janice, what are you doing up?
Tomorrow's your big day.
Yeah, right.
Looks like I caused a big mess, as usual.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You don't always cause a big mess.
Yes, she does.
She's the one that told Uncle Rubin he looked good in purple.
Janice, why didn't you tell anybody about Frank?
I guess I was hoping no one would notice.
Honey, who'd you think you were bringing him home to?
Stevie Wonder?
Well, I was afraid you wouldn't approve.
Janice, you do not need our approval.
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Vivian, there's not a doubt in my mind.
Then I guess I better pick up some Barry Manilow for the reception.
Look I think there are a lot of fine young brothers out there just as good as Frank.
But you can't control who you fall in love with.
If he's still here in the morning, honey, I say marry him.
Okay?
What's going on in here?
Oh, we just thought we'd have a little snack before we went upstairs.
What's upstairs?
The electric chair?
Oh, come on, Vi.
Come on.
Sit down with us and have a snack.
No, that's all right.
I know you really don't want me to.
Of course we do.
Don't we?
Come on, sit down, Vi.
So here we are together again.
The Smith sisters.
Loud, live, and in color.
More like quiet, evil, and colored.
Damn it.
Janice, you should have told me he was White.
Clear the table.
I think she's gonna blow.
Vi, I am sick to death of your attitude.
Now if you don't want to be here, just leave.
I mean, if you don't want me to marry Frank, so who cares?
Baby, don't you have enough problems being an African-American woman?
You need a white husband to further complicate things?
What about Frank?
This isn't gonna make his life any easier.
Have you thought about that?
You thought about your children?
Or the jobs or friends you may lose because some bigot fails to see the beauty in your marriage?
Honey, I did not make the rules, but I do know how to play the game.
For survival, Janice, please don't marry this man.
Vi, Frank and I are aware of everything you just said and we can handle it, sis.
You are making a terrible, terrible mistake.
Well, I guess she'll be on the first broom back to Philly.
Hey, yo, Frank, what you doing, man?
Just trying to get some color.
It's going great, man.
For a second there, I thought you was Wesley Snipes.
Look, son, this is a big step you're about to take.
Now, first, you're not into any gambling or fancy women, are you?
No, I'm a pretty straight guy.
All right, that was gonna be my next question.
Look, man, Janice is like my big sister and I just want to make sure she's in good hands.
Don't worry, Will.
I really love her, and I'm gonna do my best to make her happy.
And when you come visit, you can borrow my Porsche.
- Got my blessing, man.
- Yeah.
- Hey, you wanna grab something to eat?
- Super.
So you need any tips on sex?
- No, not really.
- Got any for me?
Look, Mom, we have a difference of opinion, okay?
But I've made a decision, and I'm not afraid to say it.
Now, I'm going to the to the library.
Aren't you a little overdressed?
Well, I just thought that I would, you know, drop in on the on the thing.
You mean the wedding.
I heard it referred to as that before.
Will, I already told you, you're not going to that wedding.
Come on.
Look, Mom, I have to go.
I can't disappoint Aunt J. Aunt J?
Boy, I'm the one you should be worrying about disappointing.
Look, Mom.
I think I'm old enough to make this decision for myself.
Now you, too.
Why, I raise you, your Aunt Vivian, Aunt Helen, and your Aunt J. Now, all of a sudden, everybody knows more than me.
Look, Mom.
What you feel about Frank, I mean, it might be cool for you.
But that's not cool for Aunt Janice.
I sacrificed a lot for Janice and it's quite obvious that she doesn't respect me anymore.
Which also means she doesn't care about me anymore.
Well, that's fine, because I don't care about her, either.
Mom, what are you saying?
What?
Everybody that loves you got to do exactly what you say?
I mean, what if I don't choose the college that you want or I don't choose the profession you want, or don't live in the city that you want?
What?
You gonna stop loving me, too?
Look, Mom, I hope not, 'cause, look, I really love you.
I really, really love you, Mom, but I'm going to the to the thing.
If I can just make it to that door.
Will, what are you doing in that tux?
I'm going to the thing.
Hey, man, I can say it to you.
I'm going to the wedding, man.
Great.
Then you'll get to see my surprise.
Since Aunt Janice is of the Negroid persuasion and Frank is of the Caucasoid persuasion I've compiled a special medley of songs.
Give a listen.
So what do you think?
I think you were deprived of oxygen at birth.
May our love burn as bright as this candle.
May its flame burn eternally in our hearts.
If there is anyone who thinks that Janice and Frank should not be joined together in holy matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
Oh, Lord, have mercy.
Why are you all looking at me?
Reverend, go on with the ceremony.
We are paying you by the hour.

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Are you busy, Will?
No, not really.
So, what's up?
Well, they're kind of having cheerleader tryouts at school and I sort of thought about going.
But, you know, that's kind of a stupid idea, so I sort of blew it off.
Oh well, I think that being a cheerleader is a kind of, you know, a sort of a good idea.
- Do you think I have a chance?
- Of course you do.
Yo, back in Philly the girls had this cheer, right that, yo, really got the crowd hyped.
They used to be like this.
They used to, like: "We beat them, we dissed them, we kicked they butt good.
"But that was kind of stupid, y'all, we in they neighborhood!
"Run"!
Philip, this skirt used to look better, didn't it?
This didn't used to be here.
- Does this look better?
- Oh, yeah.
Now you look just like Yul Brynner in The King and I. Vivian.
You look great and you always will.
You are the best-looking 40-year-old woman in this hemisphere.
Philip, I am not 40.
I will not be 40 until 7:08 tonight.
One hour later you and your feet are gonna be at the world's greatest birthday party.
Oh, Philip, you've gone to so much trouble.
I'm so sorry I'm such a grouch.
Baby, that's okay.
Nobody's thrilled about getting not young.
But look what you've accomplished.
You're a full professor, you've got three great kids and a husband who's tall, dark, and loaded.
How many people can say that at your ZIP code?
Man, Carlton, that's kind of a smooth tie you've got there, man.
- Here, let me check that joint out.
- Sure.
It's silk twill, hand sewn in Italy.
That spider been getting on my nerves all day, man.
Check this out!
I dotted the "l" on Armani!
Will, I thought about it all weekend and I've decided to sign up for cheerleader tryouts.
Are you sure, Ashley?
You'll have to wear an indecently short skirt make a spectacle of yourself in front of your whole school and ride on a bus with a bunch of sweaty teenage boys.
Gosh, I hope I get it.
Yeah, I'm sure you will, Ash.
Hey, let me see your moves.
Well, okay.
Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar!
All for Hollingsworth Preparatory Institute stand up and holler!
Yay, school!
I take it back, Ashley.
That was incredible.
- Thanks, Carlton.
- All right.
Well, what do you think, Will?
That was, kind of dignified, Ash.
Would you like some help?
- Oh, thank you!
- Oh, you're welcome!
Well, I spent the entire day shopping for the perfect gift for us to give Mother.
But it was worth the sacrifice, she is going to love it.
Ta-da!
No, wait.
That's for me.
Oops!
For me again.
Here it is.
What's wrong with you, girl?
I gave you two weeks salary and you got a pot holder?
Shh!
I hear her coming.
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, Hilary, sweetie, these are for you.
I don't think short skirts are appropriate for me anymore.
Mother, I've been meaning to talk to you about how you look in diamonds.
There's Stacey Cooper, the dean's daughter.
You know, I heard her mother had some extensive plastic surgery.
Carlton, that is her mother.
What happened to the rest of her chins?
Yo, they look good down there.
Thank God.
I got to the mall right as it was closing.
They made a huge fuss just because I asked them to turn the escalator back on.
Anyway our present is going to be perfect.
It's a very conservative, long wool skirt.
Good.
Oh, hi!
- Vivian.
- Hi, sweetie.
How are you?
Mom, isn't that your costume from Halloween?
You know, the year you came as Tina Turner?
It certainly is.
You're not going to sing Proud Mary again, are you?
Well, I might.
The night is young, baby, and so am I. My life is great, this party's gonna be great and I look fantastic.
- Yeah, Mom, you do.
- You look great.
- I look stupid, don't I?
- Oh, Vivian.
Thanks.
Philip, this has all been just perfect.
Has?
Oh, no.
The night's not over yet.
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
Yo, we're here to display A look at a woman who is forty today She's smart and well-dressed, so just to give thanks This is your life, Vivian Banks!
Remember 1951?
Remember Chuck Berry?
Remember Hula-Hoops?
Me neither!
Hold up, yo.
Well, that was the year that Vivian Smith was born.
Eat your heart out, LaToya.
In just a few short years, little Vivian starred in her first dance recital.
Over a quarter of a century ago.
The seasons came and went.
The 60s.
The Dark Ages of fashion.
Yet, Vivian braved the afro, the dashiki, and the platform shoe.
She went off to college with dreams of being a dancer.
Time marched on.
As the days turned into years Vivian got a teaching degree, got married, and moved to California.
The years rolled by.
Today, Vivian Banks has matured into a successful college professor outstanding wife and mother, and a tribute to middle age.
Hold up, y'all.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Now, see a lot of people make jokes about being 40, but we're not living like that here.
'Cause 40 ain't old if you're a giant sequoia!
After all, life begins at 40.
Oops, did I say "life"?
I meant gum disease.
Really, 40 is just the beginning.
The beginning of the end!
What we're trying to say here is What is going on?
The candles, sir.
The system really isn't equipped for that kind of heat.
Two returns in two days.
How humiliating.
The second time I had to pretend I was my own twin.
- Well, what did you get her?
- This is Mom-proof.
Any professor would be proud to carry this whether she's wearing a dress or a G-string.
'Course, with that second outfit, attendance would shoot up.
Among other things.
Where's your mom?
She hasn't come down since we got home from school.
She's probably going to be moody and depressed.
- So let's try and be understanding, okay?
- Sure.
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, Mommy.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
Good call, Uncle Phil.
Philip, I had the greatest day, thanks to you.
That party really helped me put things in perspective.
Last night I realized that my career has gotten in the way of the thing that's the most important to me.
That's wonderful, honey.
Well, I hope you know I'm behind you, whether you want to be a professor or a loving wife who devotes her day to supporting her hardworking husband and keeping an immaculate home.
I'm glad.
Because I've made a decision.
You're gonna vacuum in that?
No!
I'm gonna dance.
Well, I'm all set for dance class.
Has anybody seen my keys?
Where's my purse?
Where's my car?
Aunt Viv, maybe I should drive you.
I gotta go down to Jazz's anyway.
I'd appreciate that, Will.
Mom, before you go, could you sign this so I can go to cheerleader tryouts?
Oh, Ashley, I am so proud of you.
Sweety, I know you've wanted to do this since you were a child.
But just remember: No matter how nervous you get don't give up.
No matter what the odds.
Even if you feel foolish leaving an important position at your school.
You have to hold your head up high walk out that door, get in your car, and follow your dream.
Y'all remember that movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?
The Israeli folk-dancing class is down the hall.
- Is this Advanced Jazz?
- Yes.
Then I'm in the right place.
So, anyway, last summer I was in A Chorus Line and Oklahoma.
Really?
I was in West Side Story, Gypsy, and My Fair Lady.
Really?
Actually, the last thing I was in was the supermarket.
I guess you could say, you know, I'm into all type of artistic endeavors, you know?
I like dance, the theater, opera.
I'm a pretty cultured brother.
Wow, just like that, huh?
Okay, we'll start in a minute.
Up.
All right, class, let's begin.
Warm up, space it out.
And five, six, seven, eight.
And contract.
Five and six, head, seven, eight.
Fingers open, straighten out.
Head look, contract, release.
And up.
And stand, and pose.
Repeat.
Five and six and seven, eight.
Good.
Arms up, contract.
Good.
Up!
So, Mom, how was dance class?
It was like heaven.
Except the angels was doing splits.
It was hell on earth.
So, how was dance class?
Great!
You know, Vivian, maybe you jumped into this too fast.
You might just need to relax.
And I have just the thing.
Two first-class tickets to Hawaii!
Philip, how could you?
I just thought you might want to take it easy.
Easy?
Easy?
Philip, I took it easy 20 years ago when I got that teaching degree.
I don't want to take the comfortable road anymore.
And you shouldn't have to.
Hand over the keys to your Benz.
No one is going to stop me from being a dancer.
Now, there's an audition in three weeks, and I am going to take every class I can.
I'm gonna show the world that Vivian Banks can dance.
Well, this is it.
The audition.
I guess I'd better get going, huh?
I guess I'm a little nervous, but that's silly.
Why should I be nervous?
I just have to do a few dance steps in front of a professional choreographer and a room full of 20-year-olds who've been dancing their whole lives.
I'm gonna go to bed and eat a cheesecake.
No, no.
Vivian.
You're gonna go to that audition and you're gonna give it everything you've got.
Thank you, Philip.
Hey, go get them, Aunt Viv.
You know, Uncle Phil most husbands wouldn't want their wives running off half naked to a bunch of bulging, masculine dancers that's gonna be grabbing them and lifting them in places their husbands forgot existed.
I guess that's what trust in a marriage is all about.
Thank you, Will.
Vivian!
Excuse me.
There's an audition here today.
I know.
Auditions usually require dance training.
- You haven't been to any classes.
- Unless you count Lamaze.
Well, actually, I've been taking private instruction with Natalia Broshkova.
- The dancer?
- No, the obstetrician.
Okay, people.
We're looking for three of our leading roles, so let's get started.
We have to learn this combination.
Okay?
Five, six five, six, seven, eight.
A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Down, up, and rock, and rock, and one, two, three, four, and five, six seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, head, head, head, over up, pop-pop.
And walk it, and walk it, and walk it.
And step, step, double turn, down, cross, swing around.
Up, change.
Okay.
Let me have my first four.
Let's have you you you, and you.
Come on down.
Everybody else All right, ready?
Here we go.
Five, six five, six, seven, eight.
One.
All right!
All right!
Very good!
Okay.
Next four.
Are you ready?
Five, six, seven, eight So, you're home.
So, is there anything you know, new?
Audition go okay?
It was better than okay.
It was great.
They offered me one of the lead roles!
That's great, Aunt Viv.
Hold up.
When's the cast party?
I wanna sit next to that honey that was doing the splits.
Hold it, guys.
I am not gonna do the show.
I turned down the part.
All right.
I mean, if that's okay with you.
Philip for the last 20 years I have wondered if I could have made it as a dancer.
And now I know I could have twenty years ago.
These have been the hardest three weeks of my life.
There isn't a part of my body that isn't aching for Bengay.
But I miss books.
I miss my kids.
And do you know what I miss the most?
What, honey?
Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Swiss Almond.
I wish I could have seen those kids' expressions.
Sounds like you left them dancing in your dust.
Philip, do you think I'm old?
Of course not.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Woman, look in that mirror and tell me what you see.
I don't know.
Well, let me tell you.
I see every great thing a man could possibly want in a woman.
Eyes so dark and deep a man could get lost in them.
Skin the color of mahogany soft as satin.
A body fit for a goddess.
Look how beautiful you are.
Look.
Look how beautiful you are.
Why do you think I make it home by 6:00 every night?
I thought it was for those little cheese things Geoffrey makes.
Well, it's not.
Are you too tired for one more dance?
Oh, baby, not with you.
Philip!
Maybe I should sit this one out.
An even better idea.
Hey, hey, hey!
Say hello to Miss Pompom!
- Ashley, you made cheerleader?
- Yes!
- Will's cheer did it.
- Okay, go on, show them your moves.
Okay, Will, but you'll have to fill in for little Bobby Greenspan.
Okay, that'll be swell.
One, two, three, four.
Your school is whack!
Your school is whack!
Wherever y'all came from, just take your butts back!
You look great, and you always will!
You are the greatest 40 Any professor would be proud to carry this whether she's wearing a dress or a G-string.
'Course, that second outfit you know, would do something.
Now, I do know my line.
You know, it just slipped my memory for a second.
- But I know it!
- Yeah, yeah I know what it is!
I know what it is!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
I can't feel it yet, Philip.
Move a little to the right, baby.
I'm about to go downstairs to the family room.
Gee, I hope there ain't nobody down there getting busy.
Will, your aunt thought her earring rolled under the couch.
Look, man, y'all are married.
Where y'all put your earrings is your business.
What do you want, Will?
Yo, them two Lakers tickets you promised me.
- I'm taking Jazz.
- No, you're not.
I'm giving the other one to one of my clients' daughters.
I get it.
This is a setup, right?
Come on, Uncle Phil, no way.
I can't let my man down.
They're floor seats, center court.
You know, come to think of it, I don't even know if Jazz likes basketball.
Don't try to move the couch, Philip.
Just forget the earring.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because I can't stand up.
In theory, that probably means that you can't run, either.
Right?
Which probably makes this a pretty good time to tell you that I wore that earring to school today.
Get him, Vivian.
Well, Geoffrey, it looks like I'm all ready for the harvest dance.
Tux?
Check.
Shoes?
Check.
And a pure silk, hand-stitched pocket square.
Exquisite.
It is definitely peach season, man.
Will, that's disgusting.
Would you please clean this for me, Geoffrey?
I would prefer an assassin's bullet to this kind of living hell.
Yo, I think G's drawers must be bunching again.
So have you got a date to the dance yet?
I will when I call Claudia.
Claudia?
As in head cheerleader?
Why don't you just ask Sinead O'Connor?
I did, but she had to wash her hair.
That's probably your date to the Lakers' game.
Why don't you just take her to the dance?
Wait.
First of all, it is not a date.
She's coming to pick up her ticket, and then she's gonna go.
Man, I'm not down with that blind-date stuff.
Every time they get here they look like Yo, man, where's my date?
Miss Denice Williams.
Hi, I'm Dee Dee.
I can't believe we got center court, floor seats to the Lakers' game.
That's my team.
I know they're gonna kick butt tonight.
Don't you think?
Hello?
I know they don't walk in LA, but I at least hoped they talked.
- I'm Will and this is my cousin Carlton.
- Hi.
Can you do that and walk at the same time?
That's darn clever.
- So, Dee Dee, what school do you go to?
- Well, I just moved here Listen, Dee Dee, you know what?
I don't think I'm gonna be able to take you to that game 'cause I got this stuff piled in my car.
There probably wouldn't be enough room for you.
I mean, not just you, anybody.
- What are you talking about?
- Our blind date to the game.
Blind date?
No, see, I don't do blind dates.
I mean, you think it's gonna be Mr. Right and then it ends up being some tall, skinny guy with big ears and weird clothes.
I mean, not just you, anybody.
Look, here you go.
Here's your ticket.
Hey, maybe I'll see you at the game.
You probably will.
I'll be the one in the seat next to you shouting my phone number to Magic Johnson.
Bye, Carlton.
I'll see you later.
I hope Magic ate his Wheaties.
Okay, here are the files you asked for, sweetheart.
Thank you.
I need a copy of the Richburg merger and find out if we got a continuance on the Seger case.
Philip, I am tired of this.
You're just lying on your back giving orders, and I'm doing all the work.
Why does this seem so familiar?
Well, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to get a little work done.
Philip, Dr. Black said the best thing for you to do is rest.
Now if you need anything else, use the intercom.
Yo, what's up, Uncle Phil?
Hey, yo, the game was live, man.
The Sixers crushed the Lakers.
I never heard so much rough language in my life.
- Was Dee Dee offended?
- No, only when they told her to shut up.
You know, Dee Dee is real cool, though, man.
She's coming over tomorrow.
We gonna listen to some tapes.
- Sounds like you two are getting along.
- Yeah.
Why don't you ask her to the dance?
You're clowning me, right, Uncle Phil?
No, but look, man, I'm telling you, Dee Dee is real down and everything but you know how it would be to take somebody to the dance that's real big.
On sports, big Yeah, well, look, I already asked Claudia anyway almost.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.
I came to keep you company.
Where's the remote?
Darling, there's nothing on TV to stimulate the intelligent mind.
Uncle Phil, you must be tripping, man.
This is the episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk sleeps with that green girl.
Will, that is such worthless drivel.
Look, the home-shopper's channel.
So with the Sandwich King all you need is two pieces of white bread and a can of delicious chili.
And in less than a minute you have a mouthwatering chili-pocket.
You gourmets may want to squirt a little cheese on top.
Yuck.
Man, I haven't heard of nothing that disgusting since Clarence Thomas found that hair on his cola.
Look, Will, you are entitled to your opinion but the best movie ever made was not Cleopatra Jones.
It was Casablanca.
Please.
Here you have a movie set in Africa there's only one brother in the whole thing, and he's from Detroit.
- Okay, but you know a movie I really like?
- What?
- Shaft.
- Shut your mouth.
I'm talking about Shaft.
Then we can dig it.
"He's a complicated man "but no one understands him but his woman".
John Shaft.
Thanks a lot, G. Hey, what's up, G?
You don't think that's funny?
Yes.
I'm about to laugh myself into a seizure.
This is just fine and dandy.
The cleaners shrunk my tux.
Carl, man, you can wear that.
Just put it on and say, "Boss, da plane, da plane".
Why don't you just rent a tux?
Great.
Wear used clothes.
Why don't I just go pitch a tent under a freeway and eat cold beans with a stick?
It's just a dance.
But I heard the music is gonna be bumping.
- It's probably gonna be a lot of fun.
- Yeah.
I mean, I've already asked Claudia, almost.
You know, right, cool.
Well, you know, see, I'm still trying to get my rap together.
I got as far as, "Yo, yo, baby.
Yo, baby, yo".
Look, I don't mean to butt in, but I'm sure her name is not Yo and I know she ain't got your baby.
I mean, why don't you try something more honest like: I think you're great.
I'd be honored if you'd go to the dance with me.
Honest.
Damn, what a concept.
You know, thank you.
See, you know what?
Most women won't tell you stuff like that.
- That's cool, you know.
- No, really, you're different.
You know, I mean, you're not afraid to just say what you think, you know or do something silly, or, you know, just bug out.
That's decent.
You make me feel so, man, I don't know.
So So hungry.
Hungry is what you make me.
Yeah, man.
I could go for a nacho refill, right?
Yeah?
Right, I'm gonna make this call to Claudia first though, right?
You know, I mean, I don't want to forget what you said.
Honest, right?
Honest.
There's a hex on me.
All the tuxes that are halfway acceptable in this town have been rented.
My shoes, which I put outside for a final Scotchgarding were carried off by a Labrador retriever.
What else could go wrong?
How about that big old zit on your nose?
I'm finished with my hoagie, Aunt Viv.
I'm gonna go meet Dee Dee for a pizza.
Dee Dee?
- Is that who you're taking to the dance?
- No, Aunt Viv.
See, it's not like that with me and Dee Dee.
We're just buddies.
I'm going with Claudia Prescott.
That girl's built to take all of my money.
- I like Dee Dee.
She's fun.
- And she's cute.
But I'm worried about her cholesterol level.
Hey, I'll see you all later.
My man, Will.
- Ty, what's up, baby?
- What up, man?
Dee Dee, I'd like you to meet my friend, Ty.
- My sister, how you doing?
- Hi.
Check it out.
Let me go grab my order pad.
I'll hook you up.
All right, man.
Yo, bro.
Kellogg Lieberbaum, yo.
This is my man, Cornflake.
Well, aren't you going to introduce us to your date?
This is my friend, Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, meet the brat pack.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Excuse me while I go to Hell, I'm going to the bathroom.
Good work, bro.
She's quite a fly sister.
Yeah, and I bet she's tons of fun.
You know, as a matter of fact, she is.
Hey, good honey is hard to find.
Of course, that one would be hard to lose.
Cornflake, remind me to talk about them guy's mothers when we get to school on Monday.
Yo, Ty, give me a large pepperoni and two colas.
So we got your date covered.
What you having?
Hey, look, Ty.
Come on, please.
Don't even start.
That is my friend, that's it.
All right, cool out, man, you know, 'cause it ain't my fault the babe's got more buns than a day-old bakery.
- That's all I'm saying.
- Hey, now, hold on.
- Now how you trying to play me?
- I ain't trying to play you.
You've seen the honeys that I've had up in here.
I can't figure out how a brother goes from T-bone to rump roast.
That's all.
Man, that girl is not my girlfriend.
I'm not your friend, either.
Hey, Dee Dee.
Hey, this is Will.
Pick up that phone, girl.
Hey, Dee Dee, I ain't playing.
Pick up the phone.
Hey, Dee Dee, if you don't pick up that phone, I'm gonna have to call you back.
And I ain't afraid to do it, neither.
Look, Dee Dee, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was tripping.
I'll call you back later.
Bye.
I don't even know why I'm making such a big deal about this.
She's not even my type.
You like the same movies, same music same food, same jokes and you both enjoy sticking straws up your noses.
I know, Aunt Viv, but other than that we don't have nothing in common.
It's her weight, isn't it?
You may have noticed that your Uncle Philip is overweight.
And you may also have noticed that I could care less and that I love him very, very much.
Dad changed his mind.
He doesn't want a Belgian waffle.
He wants you to use his new Sandwich King to make a chili-pocket sandwich.
I'll put some chili in his pocket.
Dee Dee?
Hold on.
It's for you, man.
Hello?
Hi, Kelly.
All ready for tomorrow night's big soiree?
What do you mean you can't go?
What kind of medical reason?
A pimple?
Kelly, that's no reason to stay home.
Look, I have a pimple.
Actually, I have two.
Hello?
That's it, my life is cursed.
No tux, no shoes, no date.
Okay, don't panic.
There's got to be someone I can call.
But what kind of girl is sitting home without a date for a Saturday night?
A great girl.
So, anyway, Tiffany and Nica and I walk into the Yacht Club and we're the only ones in white.
So Tiffany says, "Oh, my God!
It's the day after Labor Day".
And we just all wanted to die.
And that's a true story.
Wow, have you sold the movie rights yet?
I don't get it.
Look, here comes Carlton.
Come on in, C. You look cool, man.
Well, maybe you're right.
I probably don't look as bad as I think, huh?
No, you got a sort of a Lou Rawls thing going there, man.
Yes, Carlton, you do look top-notch, I must say so.
Honestly, Will, if he sits with us, I'm leaving.
Well, Claudia, what are you talking about?
That's my cousin.
Well, it ain't like we brothers or nothing.
Beat it, C. Hey, Carlton.
Great minds think alike, huh?
I wonder if you could hang yourself with a cummerbund.
Next to your faithful dog this Prince Albert pants-presser is a man's best friend.
For just $39.95 your creases will be the talk of the town.
And the attachments Darn.
That's what I should have ordered instead of that pinky ring.
What is going on in here?
We're shopping in the comfort of our home and we're saving money, too.
How did they do it?
"Volume".
Philip, Dr. Black said you should be resting.
I want everyone to leave.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, baby.
Last one to the family room pays for all the shipping and handling.
Philip, if you ever want to stand up straight again you need some rest.
Okay, I'll just lay here and do nothing flat on my back.
Philip, I'm so sorry if I was stupid enough to think that there was something really wrong with you.
Vivian it's a miracle.
I can walk!
And then, if you divide the number of atoms in a cubic centimeter of air by the number of people in this room, you get a prime number.
That is totally nifty, isn't it, Carlton?
So there we are in a sailboat in the middle of the lake and I look down and Nica has on sandals instead of deck shoes.
I mean, can you just imagine how I felt?
Yeah, like jamming a fork in your hand you know, just to make sure you're still alive.
No, but that's okay.
Look, I'm gonna go fix my hair.
Cornflake, come on, come with me, man.
You push her in.
I'll flush.
You know, I wonder what Dee Dee is doing, man.
She's dancing.
- What?
How do you know that?
- Because she's right over there.
Hey, wait a minute.
She's supposed to be at home not returning my phone calls.
Excuse me.
Dee Dee, what are you doing here?
And who's this?
I'm dancing.
This is Robert.
Robert, this is Will.
We used to hang out.
Hi, Will.
- I'm gonna go get us some punch.
- Thank you.
Where'd you find him at?
Rent-a-sucker?
Look, I'm on a date, Will.
You know, like when a guy who likes a girl asks her out and they go somewhere and he still acts nice to her when they get there?
You know, I do go on dates.
Look, Dee Dee, I just thought that You just thought that 'cause I'm not a size six, no one would ask me out.
Well, not everyone feels like that.
I mean that's just your hang-up, isn't it?
Dee Dee, listen.
I really like you a lot, all right?
You really like being with me as long as no one thinks you're with me.
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just not good enough for me.
So that's when we realized that we were the only ones in white.
And we just all wanted to die.
You know what color I really like?
Strawberry.
I don't get it.
and now that Beemer runs like a top.
You know, I think that's really ex-straw-dinary I don't get it.
Wait a minute.
Hold it, Dee Dee.
Would you ever wear white after Labor Day?
If I can button it, and it's clean, I'll pretty much wear anything.
My kind of honey.
You know, Dee Dee I never thought I'd have you in bed on the first night.
Well, I can honestly say this is the first time I've ever done this.
This clever device is probably I can't believe we didn't get in on that abdominizer.
Well, that's because you couldn't decide between the chocolate gavel and the picture of the dogs playing poker.
Will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to hear the musical toilet seat.
It's 12:01.
Thank God this day is over.
I look like I escaped from the '70s.
I've spent the whole night with two guys who consider picking their faces a hobby and I got a flat tire on the way home.
I just want to sit down and pretend this never happened and if one more thing happens to me, I'm gonna kill myself.
Other than that, man, I mean, I like her.
Besides, I've already asked out Claudia.
- Too late.
- Damn.
I can't believe we got Lakers teats, center court floor Damn!
I would prefer an assassin's bullet to this kind of living hell.
I'm sorry.
I prefer assassin's bullet to this kind of hell.
That wasn't funny.

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Honey, I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Quick, Jazz, hide, man.
Man, I thought you said your uncle was asleep.
He was.
He must have had that reoccurring nightmare where he misses a meal.
Son, what are you doing still up?
It's a school night.
Homework, Uncle Phil.
I'm watching a television program on farm practices in the Midwest.
Look, Arnold the pig is wearing Eddie Albert's pajamas.
Yeah, I've seen that one.
Turn it off.
Go to bed.
What is that smell?
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil, I thought I was alone.
No, I don't mean that.
Smells like cheap cologne and fried chicken.
I resent that.
Oops.
About to shake them, not trying to break them.
Let's go.
Looking for Little Joe.
Everybody scream when "deuce deuce" hit the floor.
There, right where you belong, in jail.
Aunt Viv, can I borrow some money for protection while I'm in the slammer?
I am kind of cute, you know.
Sorry, baby, the rent just went up.
And I am moving on up to Park Place.
My turn.
Looking for Little Joe, Momma's gonna buy a new Gucci bag from the store.
We're home, everybody.
Good evening, Mrs. Banks, Mr. Banks.
How wonderful it is to see the whole family spending time together.
I thought that only happened on The Cosby Show.
Eric, son, you're back early.
You know me, sir.
I wouldn't want to violate your curfew.
Ain't his curfew he's worried about you violating.
You must be Carlton.
Your father really speaks highly of all of you at the law firm.
No, my man.
I'm Will.
Who?
So, then, Eric - did you two have a nice time at dinner?
- Yes, ma'am.
The restaurant Mr. Banks recommended was excellent.
The view was magnificent and of course it was only enhanced by your beautiful daughter.
And I can definitely see where she gets her looks from.
Man, I thought you sucked up.
You're just a Dustbuster compared to that dude.
Oh yeah?
When I'm his age I'll be twice the suck-up.
Eric, I don't know what it is but you look a little different this evening.
I made him take off those tired glasses.
She thinks I look like Blair Underwood without them.
Obviously, Hilary's the one that needs the glasses.
I brought a video home.
Would anybody care to watch?
Great, Dad.
I hope it's a James Bond film.
Close.
It's Banks, Philip Banks.
When I won the Markus v. State of California case.
Honey, I'm sorry, I'd love to watch but I have to balance my checkbook.
Not without your banker.
I'd watch it with you but I don't want to.
I guess that just leaves you and me, Mr. Banks.
From what I studied about the case in law school you were brilliant.
Yeah, I was quite a litigator in those days.
Now it's a rare thing.
So, Hilary, has Eric shown you his legal briefs?
I don't like that guy.
He's a pompous, preppie, suck-up.
He reminds me of someone.
I happen to like him.
He knows how to treat a woman with respect.
Yeah, that reminds me, I need a back seat for my date tomorrow night.
Which means I'm gonna need the car.
So give me the keys.
Tough luck, Will.
I have a meeting with my debate team.
Sorry, Carlton, but I have to buy a dress.
Hold up, Hilary.
That is not fair the way you keep hogging the car.
Okay, I'll compromise with you guys.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- No, let's play Three Stooges.
Hey, Moe!
Come on, guys.
All right, you ready?
All right, ready, set, shoot.
Well, scissors cut paper, Will.
Rock breaks your scissors, Carlton.
- Wait, hold it.
- No, you lost fair and square, Will.
Looks like you're out of luck.
Carlton, I'll drop you off.
Now, hold it.
Don't paper get nothing?
Paper gets to ride his bike.
What is that?
Vivian, I think it's the big one.
Not unless he's "down with OPP".
"Yeah, you know me".
Surprise!
You've heard of the Batmobile, get a load of the Rapmobile.
I have never seen so much trash in one car.
Who cut the Mr. Banks.
Sorry, I didn't see you.
As hard as that is to believe.
- Will, where did you get this car?
- I bought it, Aunt Viv.
With the money from my allowance and my part-time job at the restaurant.
But did you get insurance?
Check this out, Uncle Phil.
I got this fly stereo system.
Did you get insurance?
All this stuff I got in the car I got from Jazz's connection at the Pep Boys.
His mom used to date them.
But did you get insurance?
No, but I got this real fly Malcolm X air-freshener.
Until I see some insurance papers, you're not driving this car.
In fact, what kind of idiot would sell a car without insurance?
I resent that.
The joke's on you, Mr. Banks.
You can't throw me out 'cause I'm already outside.
Sweetheart, you look so delicious without those glasses.
Won't you take them off for your little Hilary?
Not you, fool.
Could we please have some privacy?
First things first, you're supposed to be my woman.
I'd like an explanation, if you please.
Okay, well, I'm Eric.
How you doing?
Suddenly, I'm hungry for some fried chicken.
Come on, Hilary, let's get something to eat.
Wait, hold up, my brother, you got this in reverse, man.
You already got her on the couch.
Save your money.
- Let me grab my wrap.
- What about my rap?
Man, Jazz, I can't believe this.
The malls are closing in 15 minutes.
The bus stop's gonna be packed with honeys.
And the Rapmobile is on ice.
How Uncle Phil gonna play me?
Hilary's an ignorant somebody.
She ain't even call me to tell me she quit me.
I deserve that much.
I'm a man.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm a man, too.
But Uncle Phil's an extremely bigger man.
Two can play at that game.
I got an idea.
The malls are closing.
Let's cruise down there in your new ride and pick up some honeys.
Hold up.
Are you telling me that I should disobey my Uncle and do something that he specifically told me not to do?
It won't be the first time.
Posse out.
A wise butler sees nothing, hears nothing and takes detailed notes for his book.
Another chapter.
Damn, Eric.
Didn't you see me backing out the driveway?
I don't believe this.
Your piece of junk just backed into the custom fender of a $35,000 automobile, pal.
You're gonna have to turn in a lot of soda cans to pay for that.
I got a whole living room full of soda cans.
Man, I don't believe this.
Lookit, man, this thing used to say "cold chilling".
Now it says "old chili".
What's the name of your insurance company?
Yo' fault.
I don't have none and I don't need none 'cause it's your fault.
- Hilary, can I use your phone, please?
- Yeah, go ahead.
It better be a local call, too.
Excuse me, Mr. And Mrs. Banks.
Mr. Banks, I have a little problem, I need some advice.
I'll meet you upstairs, pooky-pooh.
All right, son.
Make it quick.
Sir, what would you do if you got into a fender-bender with an acquaintance who is uninsured and refuses to pay for damages?
Eric, you're a lawyer.
And as a lawyer, you can't let personal feelings enter into it.
Now, anybody who drives a car without insurance deserves a lesson.
I suggest you take him to court and let justice prevail.
Thank you, sir.
Daddy!
Hey, Hilary, don't worry about it, it's all settled, sweetheart.
- Will, I'll see you in court.
- Court, huh?
There's a ball and a hoop out back, we can go now, sucker.
Still hiding from Dad, huh?
Look, man, I am not hiding, all right?
I bought a car, I drove a car, and I had a wreck.
So what?
- I'll tell Uncle Phil that to his face.
- Hi, Dad.
Now that's extremely creative, Carlton.
"Look behind you, there's Dad".
I sure hope Luther Vandross is in the house.
Mr. Marshall.
State Marshall.
I guess you're looking for Will Smith.
There he is, my man, right there.
- I'm looking for Philip Banks.
- I'm Philip Banks.
Sir, this is a subpoena.
Could you sign right here, please?
Have a nice day.
I can't believe this.
Eric is taking me to court.
Can he do that?
Will is a minor.
I am his legal guardian.
Whoa, hold it, wait.
Let me get this straight.
I buy a car, I don't get insurance, I get in a wreck, and you get sued?
That's right, Will.
Man, works for me.
Jazz, man, what are you trying to pull?
$10,000 a year for life.
You know what, I don't think it's quite tight enough.
Okay.
But you can't blame me for my entrepreneurial spirit.
- Banks, party of six, please.
- Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
I see they've already been seated.
Sorry.
When I realized I'd have to raise my right hand, I stopped to buy gloves.
Could you just die?
Why, hello, everyone.
Nice day, isn't it?
I don't have to answer that.
Mr. Banks, I just wanted to wish you good luck.
Son, I'm not the one who's going to need luck.
I'm not only going to win.
I'm going to chew you up and spit you out.
I've seen him do a lot of chewing but I ain't never seen him spit nothing out.
All rise.
Division 43 of the Los Angeles Municipal Court is now in session.
The Honorable Harry Wilson presiding.
Seated.
Let's see.
Case number 3005, Sanders v. Banks.
Says here the defendant, Will Smith, allegedly sideswiped the plaintiff, Eric Sanders at the home of Philip Banks.
Home.
Must be nice.
My wife took mine in our divorce settlement.
I hate her.
Well then, Mr. Sanders would you like to approach the bench and give us your opening statement?
Yes, Your Honor.
And, by the way, I am deeply sorry about your domestic situation.
Your Honor, I was backing out of the Banks' driveway when I heard loud, obnoxious music of the rap persuasion.
The next thing I knew, Will Smith recklessly sideswiped my sole means of transportation.
I object, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor, I object, this man is badgering the witness.
Young man, there is no witness.
I know, I just always wanted to say that.
I object because the volume of the stereo has absolutely no bearing on my client's ability to operate a vehicle.
Objection sustained.
Mr. Sanders, how much are you suing for?
$2,500 in damages.
Would the defense like to make an opening statement?
No, Your Honor.
I'd like to call my first witness, Will Smith.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth - so help you God?
- I do.
And I categorically deny all the charges against me.
This is something that's been drummed up by the Democrats.
My fault.
A little too much CNN.
Mr. Smith, could you tell us in your own words what happened?
Yes.
Peep this, your J-ship.
Me and Jazz were about to cruise down to the mall in the honey wagon.
So we can pack it up with some honeys.
So, I popped a little Peabo in the Pioneer, checked my pocket for my Binaca 'cause fresh breath can make the difference between getting a honey's number and getting flipped the bird.
Honey flipped me the bird at a bus stop this morning.
That's the most action I've had in six months.
You were saying something, Mr. Smith?
Yes, so, I checked my rear-view mirror and no sooner did I accelerate than out of nowhere the plaintiff this seer-sucking Brooks Brother over here, came barreling out of nowhere - and bashed right into me.
- Anything else, Mr. Smith?
Yeah, keep hope alive.
You are somebody.
Thank you.
You can put your hands down, Jazz.
No way.
Dude's got a gun, next thing you know I got six warning shots in my back.
- Jazz.
- Okay.
I am putting my hands down now.
- Jazz, could you give us your account?
- Can't.
They closed my account.
They said I was allegedly writing bad checks.
I don't know what they talking about.
Those checks was perfectly legible.
Your Honor, I'd like to call Hilary Banks to the stand.
Were there mitigating circumstances that facilitated the perpetrator to commit any malfeasance?
I wouldn't put it in those words, exactly.
- Why not?
- Because I don't know what they mean.
All I remember was loud music and something that smelled like cheap cologne and fried chicken.
Loud music?
Loud enough to drown out the sound of my horn, Miss Banks?
Yes.
You see, Your Honor, if my own passenger could not hear my horn then it was impossible for Will Smith to hear it.
Which is why my numerous warnings went unheeded and he continued to accelerate.
That, and that alone, Your Honor caused the extensive damage to my honey wagon.
I mean my car, sir.
Would you like to cross-examine, Mr. Banks?
Yes, Your Honor.
- Miss Banks.
- Daddy.
Do you mind if I ask what Mr. Sanders was wearing the night of the accident?
Eric was wearing his fabulous stonewashed Girbaud jeans that I picked out, of course a Hugo Boss shirt, and leather boots.
- And on his face?
- Nothing.
You mean those awful glasses?
No, I made him take those off before we left the house.
So you're saying that Mr. Sanders was not wearing his glasses even though this Photostat of his license clearly states that he should wear them at all times while operating a vehicle.
Oopsy.
I rest my case, Your Honor.
- Case dismissed.
- All right.
Your J-ship, my number's in your file.
- Get with me sometime.
- Peace out.
Well, congratulations, Mr. Banks.
Don't congratulate me, son, you did an excellent job.
You're going to be a great lawyer someday.
And bringing up that stereo volume issue was excellent strategy.
Well, thank you very much, but it was clearly no match for your glasses defense.
Why don't we discuss that over dinner tonight?
- We'd love to have you.
- Well, sure.
Man, I guess if Uncle Phil can be a big man about this so can I. Of course, it's a lot easier for him.
Well, I guess we both got off on the wrong foot.
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings, man.
Ready, set, shoot.
Well, paper Ready, set, shoot.
Well, scissors cut paper, Will.
Rock breaks Rock breaks your scissors, Carlton.
Wait, hold it.

Ash, peek this, babe.
I got that magic joint down now.
Please, Will, the last time you showed me a magic trick it took two months for my hair to grow back.
Yeah, I know.
Well, that was then and this is now.
Behold, the great Willdini.
All right now, here.
Give me your watch.
All right.
What happened to "abracadabra"?
No, this is black magic, Ash.
Hold up.
I ain't finished yet.
Now, here we go.
Behold, a bottle, just as any other.
Chaka Khan!
All right.
That's it.
All right.
Now, for my next trick, I'll need a dollar bill.
I don't have a dollar.
- I have a 20.
- That'll do.
All right.
Here we go.
Notice the intricate folds.
Now for the magic words.
Going going gone!
Will!
There you go.
Some nice twelve-grain organic hot cereal.
Wow.
Looks great.
How about some of that delicious soy milk to go on top?
Okay.
Boy, that was better than the batch you made yesterday.
Good.
That's why I made twice as much today.
You keep dishing it up, Aunt Viv and we'll keep finding some place to put it.
You kids go ahead and serve yourselves.
I have to go help Ashley with her hair.
Look, I know Mom's a lousy cook, but all the same I'm really glad that she quit her job.
Yeah, I mean, having her home all the time is great.
I mean, you know, she picks our clothes out for us and checks our homework and cuts the crust off the end of our bread.
Hey, look, that woman must be stopped, y'all.
That diet and exercise regimen your mother put me on has really changed my life.
I never felt better.
It's so nice having her home all the time.
She wakes up cheerful in the morning leaves little love notes in my briefcase calls me up at work just to chat.
That woman must be stopped.
- Hi, baby, how was your walk?
- Wonderful.
Madam, I have taken the liberty of polishing your grandmother's silver for tonight's dinner party.
Is that G or Philip Michael Thomas?
I take it you're referring to this charming ensemble which your aunt insisted I wear.
It is only my humble opinion but that woman must be stopped!
Ciao.
Now I want everyone home at 7:30 sharp.
Yes?
We're having a get-together with the neighbors and I have invited Sonya Lamor.
Word?
Sonya Lamor?
I've seen all her movies on the late show.
Yeah, she did a lot of those historical dramas.
My personal favorite was George Washington and the Hussy.
Ladies and gentleman, give it up for the star of Heidi Comes to Harlem.
Mom, if you make me go to school like this I'm going to write a book when I grow up.
You kids don't know how lucky you are, now that she's home all the time.
Thank you, Philip.
I've never felt better since I've been on this diet of exercise and healthy food.
Uncle Phil, that was for you.
They said you left your wallet at the Donut Depot.
Pretty fly earmuffs you got there, Ash.
A little calamine lotion probably'd take care of that rash.
Very funny, Will.
Can you believe Mom made me wear this hideous dress?
Come on, Ash, not many women can carry off plaid.
And here comes one now.
Ashley, you look so adorable.
Now, don't stray too far, baby, it'll ruin the effect.
Don't worry about this, Ash.
One day you're gonna be cracking up laughing about this with your therapist.
- Okay, I'm here.
- Mom, it's not fair.
Hilary doesn't have to dress like you.
Guess again.
I wanna play!
- Wonderful party, babe.
- Thank you, Philip.
Look at poor Henry Firth.
Ever since his wife left him he's been in one meaningless unsatisfying relationship after another.
It's so sad, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Makes me want to cry.
Ms. Sonya Lamor.
That is so kind of you.
Please, no pictures.
Hi.
Ms. Lamor, I've been your biggest fan ever since I seen you in Mutiny on the Hussy.
You look dope in 3-D!
It wasn't in 3-D.
Back up.
Sonya!
Sonya, let me introduce you to my daughters: Hilary, Ashley.
- My son Carlton.
And my nephew Will.
- Gorgeous.
There is something that I am just dying to know.
Yes, I did it.
And he deserved to be slapped.
Sonya, let me introduce you to my husband Philip.
And his legal partner, Henry Firth.
Hello.
You know, I'm looking for a lawyer.
I just wrote my memoirs and I can't put it down it's so exciting.
Phil is one of the toughest negotiators in our profession.
When Jacoby sued Meyers, who do you think he called?
- Very impressive.
Let's talk sometime.
- Certainly.
There's some people I'd love for you to meet.
Thank you.
It's so kind of you.
Please, no pictures.
- Sonya, would you like something to eat?
- I couldn't eat a thing.
Wonderful sugar cake.
Can I get a little, tiny, weensy piece, please?
Certainly.
I said a little piece, not a crumb.
It's wonderful.
It's magnificent.
May I steal the recipe?
I'd be more than happy to give it to you.
Thank you so much.
- Miss Lamor?
- Yes, darling.
- You mind taking a picture?
- Of course not.
All right, here, I want you to get my good side.
I hope Sonya goes for this contract proposal.
Maybe this cake will sweeten the deal.
Will and I are going to Tower Records to pick up a few CDs.
I'm gonna teach Carlton how to tap his foot on beat.
Great, you can stop and drop this cake off at Sonya's.
All right.
Madame, I have some distressing news.
Your heirloom silverware is missing!
And someone's stolen my new uniform!
What?
It's probably just misplaced.
- Let's split up and look for it.
- Oh, no.
Don't trouble yourself, sir.
I'll just go back to wearing my old uniform.
I was talking about the silverware.
Let's split up and search the house.
All right, I'll check the pool.
Will, don't even try it.
There's no need to check the pool, the Jacuzzi, the tennis court or the basketball net.
Will, check the pool, the Jacuzzi, the tennis courts, and the basketball net.
It wasn't in the basement either.
But I did find Geoffrey's new uniform crammed behind the hot-water heater.
The scoundrels must have ditched it in their haste to escape.
The silver's obviously not in the house.
It must have been stolen.
I would hate to think that a neighbor took it.
We need that little white lady from Murder, She Wrote.
Boys, we'll keep looking, but go ahead - and drop this cake off at Sonya's.
- All right.
And if you all happen to be digging around under my bed those videotapes are for my report on Clarence Thomas.
Coming.
So kind of you.
No pictures.
Hi, Ms. Lamor.
My mom baked you this cake.
How sweet of her.
Come on, guys, please come in.
This house is no joke!
Isn't this the cane that you used in An Officer and a Hussy?
I played opposite Olivier.
Laurence Olivier was in An Officer and a Hussy?
No it was his brother, Wendall.
Check this out, hold up.
"Lamor and Gable"?
You got top billing over Clark Gable?
It was Schlomo Gable, his half-brother.
Then I guess this Reagan isn't really Ronald.
No, that is really Ronald.
You see, we couldn't get his brother.
Oh, I'm so sorry, boys.
Go in there, but don't eat up the whole cake, please.
All right.
I'm a big star.
Get me a job or you're fired.
What's up, man?
I'm Will.
Polly want a cracker?
Will is a cracker.
Yeah, man, your mother poops on papers.
Will, use a fork.
Come on, man, I ain't using this wimpy fork.
This is not a wimpy fork.
This is a hand-engraved silver dessert Jumping Jehosaphat!
All right, man.
All right, I'll use the fork.
Will, I'm telling you, this is Mom's.
Ms. Lamor must have taken it.
Quick!
Dial 911!
Whoa!
Hold it.
Come on, man, look, you don't want to send her to jail.
Remember what happened to her in Hussy Behind Bars?
- We must confront her.
- Wait.
Come on, man.
What, are you tripping?
You gonna jeopardize Uncle Phil's chances of getting a book contract.
And what do you suggest we do?
I say we do what's fair and just for both parties.
Steal it back and run like hell.
I am so sorry, guys.
Carlton, weren't you just saying how much you would enjoy a tour of Ms. Lamor's house?
No time like the present.
Come on, darling.
Get your hands off that!
Not till we're married.
Would you like to see my jewelry collection?
- Do you have any tiaras?
- Of course I do.
Carlton, it's time to go, man.
I guess, then, we'll come back another time.
I'm so sorry, guys, you're leaving.
When you come back, bring me another cake.
We promise.
Is the silver in your pockets?
No, I'm just extremely happy to see you.
We did it!
God, I was fantastic!
The adrenaline was flowing, the nerves of steel were calm and steady.
Carlton, please, we lifted some silverware from a neighbor and I had to slap you twice to keep you from driving us to Mexico.
I just thought we should lay low until the heat was off.
- Aunt Viv, good news!
- You said it.
- I got my silverware back.
- How'd you know?
The caterers brought it back.
Carlton, why do I have service for eight in my drawers?
- This is all your fault!
- What?
My fault?
You're the one that said it was Aunt Viv's silverware.
Since when do you listen to me?
Let's just stop arguing, man.
Let's think of a plan.
We'll get caught.
We'll go to jail.
Kid 'N Play will portray us in a movie.
All we have to do is break into Sonya Lamor's and put the silverware back.
How do we do that?
But we're gonna need somebody to help us.
Somebody that can't figure out what we're doing, though.
Some simple-minded soul.
Thanks for the tour, but we better get going.
I know we're going to be surrounded by autograph seekers at Neiman's.
I'm used to it, darling.
I'm very famous.
No, I meant everyone always mistakes me for Whitney Houston.
- Carlton, come on.
- Will, can't you see I'm busy?
Will, there's a big black guy in the house.
Will?
Carlton, would you get in here?
Come on!
I brought these gloves so we don't leave prints.
Yellow or blue?
Yellow.
Come on, Curly, let's get this over with.
- Oh, no, someone's coming.
- Well, get off me, Carlton.
I know they're in here somewhere.
I'm sure, darling, you're going to find your car keys.
Bless you.
- I'm gonna check in the dining room.
- I'm sure it's on the dining room table.
They're not in the dining room.
I've showed you all my quarters, which means every room in the house except the garage.
I'll start with the powder room.
Okay.
How kind of you, darling.
No pictures.
I'm finished with the proposal.
I thought you might like to see a copy.
Thank you, darling.
Well, let's give it a preview.
Come in.
Certainly, if you wish.
Please come into my dining room I have some wonderful old sherry from Spain.
One of my ex-husbands brought it.
Allow me.
Thank you very much.
I'm more than happy to pour, if you wish.
Oh, yes, please do.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
We are just going to do this.
That's it.
And now for the film version of my book.
If Meryl Streep is going to play it, she must have her nose fixed.
Absolutely.
Page 3, the schnoz clause.
Darling, you're magnificent!
Yes, that's what my wife always says.
You remember my wife?
Vivian, mother of my children?
That lovely lady in the plaid.
How could I forget her?
Philip, may I ask you, are you happily married?
Oh, yes.
Very happy, extremely happily.
When we walk down the street, deer eat from our hand.
Which reminds me, I don't work with animals.
Sonya, you're a very attractive woman but I think we should keep this strictly business.
So, if you don't mind, no hanky-panky.
I agree, Philip.
So, please, cool the footsie-wootsies.
Sonya, with all due respect you're the one who's playing footsie-wootsie.
What the hell is this?
Please, darlings, you are too kind.
No pictures.
- What are you guys doing here?
- What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my car keys.
You know what?
I know where they are, Hil.
I'll go get them.
I'll start the car for you.
- I'll check the oil.
- Nobody move.
Uncle Phil, I know what you're thinking, and there's no cake left.
Will made me do it.
He held a fork to my head.
All right, it's like this, Uncle Phil.
We was coming in here to put back the silverware that we lifted because we thought that she stole it from Aunt Viv and, then we found out that she ain't lift nothing.
That's right, darling.
I'm the last real woman in this zip code.
Sonya, rest assured these two young men will be strongly disciplined.
All right, everybody, just stay right where you are.
We got a report of a break-in.
Put your hands down.
I didn't want to steal the silver.
And I didn't want to break back in to return it.
And I didn't want to hide under the furniture like a bad old episode of Laverne & Shirley.
Now I'm gonna be sent off to rot in jail.
This is all your fault.
I have witnesses.
It wasn't me.
Look at poor Henry Firth.
Ever since his wife left him he's been in one meaningless unsatisfying relationship Oh, Lord, have mercy.
I'm sorry.
After another.
The silver's obviously not in the house.
It must been stolen.
Must been stolen - Must have been stolen.
- It must've been stolen.
- Feets don't fail me now.
- Okay.
Nothing.
Fix it in post.

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Will, it's nice of you to help Mom and Dad with their bags.
Oh, yeah, man, you know, I mean, they treat me so good here I'll do whatever I can to repay their kindness.
- Can't wait for them to leave either, huh?
- Does Barry White want seconds?
Well, as acting head of the household this weekend I think you'll find me tough, yet fair.
Firm yet kind.
Hey, besides, man, Hilary's the oldest.
She's in charge.
But not equipped to lead.
She's a figurehead.
Like Queen Elizabeth.
Dan Quayle.
Colonel Sanders.
Now, I've typed up a few ground rules.
I think you should check this out.
Whoa, whoa, Carlton, come on, man, you gotta loosen up a little bit, man.
You're too tight.
Wonder you don't sneeze and pop your drawers.
Will, please, I'm hardly a stranger to life on the edge.
I can't count the number of times I've gone swimming right after eating.
I've been through the whole neighborhood and I haven't sold one box of cookies.
Even Shelley Winters turned me down.
Look, what you need is a different sales strategy.
Look, here's one that always worked for me: "Mister, I was going to sell you some cookies "but I tripped on your driveway and I think I broke my ankle.
"Could you please call my daddy?
He's a lawyer.
He'll know what to do".
Okay, Hilary, I'm leaving you $100 for groceries and here's the number where we'll be staying for the legal convention.
I can't say I'm looking forward to it.
I can't say it, because it would be a big fat lie.
Goodbye everyone.
I'm off for the weekend.
Bye, Geoffrey.
I hope you enjoy your butlers' convention.
Goodbye, Miss Ashley.
Yo, G, G. I always wondered what y'all be doing at them joints.
What is it, like reminiscing about Mr. French?
Actually, we'll be reminiscing about Benson.
It's the Black Butlers' Convention.
This year's theme is "Get It Your Own Damn Self".
See you all Monday morning.
Ready for the convention, sweetheart?
Oh, no matter how you prepare you can never really be ready for something like this.
Great.
Now, kids, you're all mature young adults and your mother and I trust you completely.
But by the same token, if any of you are planning on using this weekend as an excuse to engage in reckless activities you'll have to think again.
Misbehavior of any kind will result in immediate grounding and suspension of allowance.
Do I make myself clear?
This is a racial thing, right?
Philip, what a wonderful surprise.
Now I don't know how you pulled this off without me knowing it but I'm glad you did.
Well, I thought this might be a little bit better than a boring legal convention.
I hope you folks enjoy yourselves here at the Doomie Inn.
I'm Bob Doomie.
Well, you know, I got the same room we had on our tenth anniversary.
The "Glory That Was Rome" suite?
And if you recall, the chariot bed didn't need horses to move it across the room.
Welcome to the Casbah.
What happened to Rome?
Well, actually, the Roman suite next door is already taken.
Well, there's $50 says it isn't.
Thank you, sir, but his $200 says that it is.
Oh, Philip, this is lovely.
I'm sure it'll be just as romantic.
But I really had my heart set on wearing that toga.
I'll do my Dance of the Seven Veils.
And I didn't bring any.
Okay, kids, go to the movies.
Okay, the planet closest to the sun?
That would be Mercury.
Yo, man, you got it!
You know, you're pretty smart for a guy that's only been through the tenth grade once.
Well, you know what that means: You gotta take off your blouse.
Wait a minute.
I've played this game before.
I've never had to take off my clothes.
No, no, baby, these Canadian rules.
Will, we need a ride to the grocery store.
We're supposed to sell cookies today.
Ashley, love, pumpkin, blossom, apple why don't you go ask Carlton or Hilary?
And don't come back through here until you're 17 or accompanied by an adult.
Now, where were we?
All right, either of you ladies speak Latin?
Too bad.
Ty, get the blinds.
Yes, well, my parents are out of town, so I can do anything I want.
Now get your tail over here, pronto.
I want it fast and I want it hot.
And if it has any pepperoni on it, I'm sending that puppy back!
Carlton, we're supposed to sell cookies today - and Mom said one of you had to take us.
- You're troopers.
Take a hike.
Hilary, we need a ride to the grocery store.
Have a Slim-Fast.
I need the grocery money to buy jewelry.
But no one else will do it.
Excuse me, ladies, but when my parents are away I'm like a mother to these children and how you treat them could affect them for the rest of their lives.
Come along, little troopers.
Carlton, haul the brats.
- I'm expecting company.
- Yeah, I'll put it in the oven for you.
- You're closest to the door.
- Well, you're closest to the floor.
And I am close to snagging a garnet necklace at half price.
Now one of you get out there and fire up that Benz.
Thank you.
Okay, Thelma and Louise, park it over here.
I told you the "R" didn't mean "real fast".
Okay, I'm in charge, I'll handle this.
Young lady, what do you think, that I'm made out of money?
Hilary, what does that have to do with anything?
I don't know, that's what Dad always says to me.
I must say, color me disappointed.
This is our home.
I live here, damn it!
Now, just because Mom and Dad are away doesn't mean we should act like people without trust funds!
And besides, if anything goes wrong, it's Will's butt.
It's not so much my butt, man, it's Uncle Phil's foot coming towards it.
That's why I told the film crew to be really careful tomorrow.
They're shooting a video here.
Excuse me, girls, could you put your hands over your ears, please?
Carlton, what the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about the financial opportunity of a lifetime.
It's an investment strategy that's leveraged with zero risk.
Carlton, what the hell are you talking about?
We get $5,000 for doing jack.
$5,000?
Yo, man, I could purchase a new butt.
- Where's the money?
- They're bringing it tomorrow and they promise we won't even know they're here.
Where's the family room?
Man, I'm gonna kill Carlton!
Kill him?
I wanna know the name of his decorator.
Hey, Carlton, man, you got a lot of explaining to do and I hope it begins with the words, "They got a gun".
Calm down, Will.
All the furniture's in the back yard, safely out of harm's way and by the time Mom and Dad get back on Monday it'll all be back in place and our gross revenue will be 100% profit without losing our assets.
Look, man, I still don't know what you talking about but look, if I get killed, homey, your toe is gonna be tagged, too.
I told you.
It'll all be put back on Monday.
- Monday?
- Monday.
Monday!
And action!
Yo!
Hey, dude, what's up, man?
Yo, what's up?
Can you excuse me, please?
We're trying to do a video here, if you don't mind.
Okay?
Hi, Ron.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Michael.
- How you guys doing?
- What's up Hilary-shy?
I like that jacket.
I don't know, I think I like the yellow one better.
Listen guys, I know I said we should do lunch, but today is just awful for me.
Yeah, you got that shoe sale, right?
One of these days I've just got to take a vacation.
- Goodbye!
- See you.
Places, everybody!
Sorry, guys.
It's looking great.
Really, you guys are doing great.
And action!
Oh, my God, is that them?
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, I'm sorry about that, guys.
Listen, you know how kids get immature trying to get in front of the camera.
I'm sorry, man.
Okay!
Sorry guys.
Really, I am.
You were great.
- Monday, right?
- Monday.
And action!
- Hey, man, no.
- Look, I'm sorry.
What do you two think you're doing?
I was trying to get up to my room.
- Hey, Ty, what was you doing?
- I was trying to be in the video.
Look, man, this is my house.
You wanna be in a video, you go rob a liquor store.
There'll be no more interruptions.
You've got my word.
Action!
Party Machine, this is Will.
- Party Machine?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
Did I say "party machine"?
I meant Banks residence.
Master William speaking.
Who's playing that loud music?
Loud music?
Give me the phone, Vivian.
Will, what's going on?
Uncle Phil, that's the TV.
Carlton's watching an educational documentary on loud music.
What's that music I hear?
That's the television.
Your aunt's watching I Dream of Jeannie.
Look, we're gonna be home tonight.
Wait, baby, hold up.
I thought y'all said you was coming back Monday.
Well, we were, but there's some big shot in the suite next door and he's been tying up the hotel staff all weekend.
The service has been terrible.
So just tell everyone we'll be back tonight.
Great.
Great, I'll see you tonight.
Okay, that's a wrap.
Everybody out.
Y'all ain't got to go home, but you gotta get the hell out of here.
Will, come on, these people paid to use our house.
Let's be a little courteous.
Aunt Viv and Uncle Phil aren't coming home Monday they're coming home tonight.
- Not Monday?
- Not Monday.
Okay, that's a wrap.
Everybody out.
You ain't got to go home but you got to get the hell out of here.
Look, fellas, fellas, relax.
We got one more shot, then we're gonna bring everything in from outside.
All right, that's cool.
Is that rain?
Okay, I can't breathe.
"They'll only be here one day".
"They'll only be here one day"!
The Titanic sank in one day!
The Hindenburg blew up in one day!
The entire city of Pompeii was covered in molten lava in one day!
Okay, I can't breathe.
Relax!
Babe, trust me.
Everything will be fine when the cleaning crew gets here on Monday.
Look, man, how many times I got to tell you?
My uncle's coming back tonight!
Bubele.
Talk to your cousin Hilary, she's the one who signed the contract.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a phone call I gotta make.
Well, I'm glad I don't live here.
Boy, I'm glad I don't live here.
So am I, man.
I'm gonna have to move into your crib when my Uncle Phil bowls my butt down the driveway.
Oh, man, come on, chill out, now.
I mean, this is easy.
All you need is a little paint, a little elbow grease everybody pulling together, I'm telling you the place is gonna look dope.
You're right, you're right.
Thanks a lot, man.
Come on, let's get busy!
Oh, you know, I plan to, but not here.
See, the fly honeys invited me to the wrap party.
Later, man.
Hilary, look.
We got big, big problems.
My God, Geoffrey needs to clean up around here.
I wonder which one of you Dad will kill first?
It's 4:00 now, they'll be back at 9:00.
We'll never get this place together by then.
All right, look, look, look.
Let's not panic.
Come on.
Here's the plan.
Hilary, you take $2,000 and you go get a new couch.
Carlton, you shut up and take care of the floors.
I think I can salvage the rug, and Ashley, I want you to take care of painting.
I'm not painting.
I didn't have anything to do with this.
I seem to recall a certain little sunshine trooper trying to get her car theft badge.
Latex or enamel?
Philip, this weekend has been so wonderful!
Even if we had gone to the convention spending time alone with you would have been worth it.
- We can stay an extra day.
- Oh, no need to.
I'm taking home the red veil.
Well, I'm taking home the belly jewel.
- Why?
- Because I can't get it out.
Yes, this is Mr. Banks in the Bedouin suite.
Could you send the bellboy up to help with our bags, please?
What do you mean, he's next door?
Oh, fine, never mind, we'll do it ourselves.
This is ridiculous.
That big shot has kept the entire hotel staff busy all weekend.
Caesar!
It's time to invade Alexandria!
Coming, Alexandria!
No!
Yo, bench, you got the floor buffer!
Come on, man, turn that joint on!
Not so fast.
A wise man always reads the instruction manual first.
Page 1: "Welcome to the wonderful world of buffing.
"First, take a moment to familiarize yourself with your Buffomatic".
- Hey, can I see that for a second?
- Sure.
Come on, Einstein, I'll plug it in.
"Make sure buffer is off before plugging in".
"Do not use near water".
This is your final boarding call for Flight 32 to Los Angeles at Gate 7.
Okay, over there.
So, how do you like the couch?
Yeah, it's great.
But when does the rest of it get here?
Now, if we rearrange the room, nobody's going to even notice.
Hilary, I think Uncle Phil will notice when he stands up and it's stuck to his butt!
Hilary, you have to take it back and get the exact same couch.
Okay, but it's going to be another $2,500 including delivery.
Wait, what are you talking about?
That couch only cost $2,000 in the first place.
- Tell them.
- I will.
Yo, I think I need to have a couple words with y'all.
Don't let nobody tell you that big people can't wear plaid.
What'd you have, a Patti LaBelle nightmare?
Will, you would not look good either if you had your head stuck out of a sunroof, going 90 miles an hour holding on to a rug.
Relax, sweetheart.
Burt Reynolds does it every morning on his way to work.
We would have been here sooner, only we were stuck behind some idiot with a flying carpet.
I'm the idiot.
Hey, very good, Carlton.
That's the first step: Admitting it.
All right, we pulled it off, man.
How much money we got left?
Well, according to my calculations, we're in the hole by $80 which means you each owe me $20.
- Will you take cash?
- Sure.
- We're home!
- Here they come.
Go, go!
How was the convention?
Did you bring me anything back?
Yeah.
A mother with a big smile on her face.
Hey!
Aunt Viv!
Hey, Uncle Phil, I didn't hear y'all come in.
Well, y'all ready to read the Bible?
Again?
Well, I am pleasantly surprised.
I came home expecting a catastrophe.
I'm happy to see I was wrong.
Well, I'm going upstairs to unpack.
- Philip, are you coming?
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Good night, kids.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Uncle Phil.
- Good night, Dad.
I'll get our bags packed.
Ashley, you drive.
Philip, this weekend has been Oh, my Lord.
That's my wife!
Come, baby.
Caesar!
It's time to invade Alexandria!
Coming, Alexandria!

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Good night, Will.
- You're grounded.
Man.
I ain't played ball that hard since I left Philly, man.
Boy, that dude was no joke, man.
I ain't never playing with him again.
Why, he was pushing me around and shoving me and kicking me and all that stuff, man.
Yo, dude was a monster.
Hey, I thought you wanted a rematch.
Forget it, man.
Go pick on somebody your own size.
- Hi, Ashley.
- Hi, Ramon.
Say, I've got a half peanut butter and jelly sandwich in my pocket with your name on it.
No, thanks.
Wanna see my frog?
I think I'll pass.
Man, those lines kill on the jungle gym.
It's killing me how much you remind me of myself.
Why?
'Cause we're both down with b-ball?
Well, no, 'cause don't nobody want to see my frog neither.
See, man, one day, Ashley's gonna be breaking down my door 'cause I'm gonna save up money for basketball camp.
Next thing you know I'll be playing pro.
You know my motto: Keep your eyes on the prize.
Hey, man, that's kinda similar to my motto: Keep your hands on their thighs.
Time to go help Ma wash Mr. Steinberg's windows.
- Peace.
- Hey, be cool, babe.
Oh, by the way, G, she told me to tell you hello.
Really?
No, I just wanted to watch the Earl Grey run through your veins.
When we have children like that in England we encourage them to emigrate.
This is amazing!
Did you know the odds of getting hit by an asteroid are one in 6,000?
Really?
I'm feeling kinda lucky, man.
Why don't you go outside?
"How to Beat the Odds"?
Sorry, C., no way to beat it, you're odd.
Hilary, I just want to know what job I'll be doing so I can pick out an outfit.
Mother, the ladies at the country club put me in charge of Monte Carlo Night because I don't play favorites.
Well, just remember whose name is on your favorite credit card.
"Vivian Banks: Any job she wants".
Oh, boy, what a day!
I am exhausted.
Daddy, for Monte Carlo Night you're going to be the croupier de toilette.
Great.
What'll I do?
You'll make sure that there's always toilet paper on the rolls.
It's great to know that all those years of law school are finally coming in handy.
And, Will, you're gonna help with the cleanup.
I ain't down with that old country club stuff sitting around all night discussing mayonnaise with four white guys named Biff.
Isn't Biff a riot?
Will, this is a fundraiser for the L.A. Political Coalition.
Everything cannot always be about fun.
Hold up!
What?
Y'all gonna make me go?
Well, at least show up.
If you're still unhappy after the first half hour consider the rest of the evening punishment for something you've gotten away with.
I'd rather be stranded at sea with David Duke leading the rescue party.
Why should I have to go to this stupid country club if I don't want to?
- How Uncle Phil gonna play a nephew?
- How's Daddy gonna play a daughter?
I can't believe he thinks I'm too young to gamble.
I've been eating Hilary's cooking since I was three.
- Uncle Phil, man, you're - Looking extremely fly.
Thank you, Will.
And, yes, you still have to go.
- Daddy, I'm really - Gonna miss your daddykins?
I know, Ashley.
And, no, you still can't go.
So, do I look like a blackjack dealer?
You look great, Mother, but that's not how you wear a halter.
It is when your breasts don't come with a receipt.
Well, I'm all ready for Monte Carlo night.
I've read this book cover to cover.
Ask me about any odd combination.
Okay, why is Michael Jackson hanging with that little boy from Home Alone?
Well, we better be going.
Good night, Geoffrey.
Sir.
And, Ashley, sweetheart, I'll bring you home a stuffed Miss Piggy doll.
Oh, joy.
Being 13 bites.
And I'm too young to know what it bites.
Perhaps biting into a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie would lift your spirits.
I've poured you a nice cold glass of milk to go with it.
Why don't you just slap a diaper on me and hang a mobile over my head?
Oh, Geoffrey!
It's wonderful!
Here is your ginger ale.
Shaken, not stirred.
I trust you won't be dancing on the table with a lamp shade on your head.
Ante is one vanilla wafer.
Table limit, four mint Milanos.
Something wrong, Miss Ashley?
No.
Everything's fine.
Spill it.
Be honest.
We're playing with cookies because you think I'm a kid, right?
Well, yes.
I'm 13!
If these were the Middle Ages, I'd already be married and own a pair of oxen.
I'm an adult.
A young adult.
I'll get my wallet.
I'll get my Smurf bank.
Whoa, hold it, man.
Come on, there's an old gambling superstition.
It says that if you walk into a casino backwards you'll have good luck.
Will, you poor public school casualty.
Everyone knows there is no such thing as luck.
There's only the astute mastery of probability.
Have it your way, man.
Wow, you know, Carlton, you are lucky.
That could have been an asteroid.
You know, I hope you don't mind my saying it, but you sure look good.
How was Heaven when you left it?
Anybody ever tell you, you sure look sexy when you deal?
We all have.
We're not here because of the way she shuffles cards, you know what I mean?
Gee, it's chilly in here.
I'd hate for my wife to catch cold.
All right, Robin from the 'hood is in the house.
Give me 7-11, I don't mean the store.
Taketh from the rich and giveth unto the poor!
Blow on these bones for me, would you, slummy?
All right!
Seven!
- All right, let it ride.
- No way, Will.
Odds of you repeating that are six-to-one.
It says here don't even make this bet in your dreams.
Carlton, and I, too, have a dream.
And in it all of the world rises up and overcomes your stupidity now stay out of my face.
Come on, don't act like you never done it before.
All right, my lucky drawers is riding high, put your money on me or kiss it goodbye!
Just like it's supposed to be!
Give it to me again.
Can I get an amen?
- Amen.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Will, please, the book says there's no way you can win.
If I were you, I wouldn't touch those dice.
Posse out, short stuff.
Robin's on a roll.
All right, here we go.
Hoagies, cheese steaks, chicken on a spit seven come eleven 'cause I'm too legit to quit!
Two pairs, kings and queens.
Three aces.
Sorry, Geoffrey.
You're $94 in the hole.
Should we play again?
I think not.
Are you mad at me?
Of course not, Miss Ashley.
You play very well.
Where did you learn?
A back alley in Calcutta?
Go Will.
Will, you're insane.
Quit while you're ahead.
- Yo!
Man with the bald head.
- Yo.
Tell me what they said!
Seven!
Go Will.
Go Will.
Hey!
Now, who's hotter than Madonna in a pointy bra?
You are!
Just checking!
Seven!
May I have everyone's attention, please?
It's time for the raffle.
A cash prize of $1,000.
And the winner is number 10225.
- Carlton, did you win?
- No, I didn't play and 10225 is my lucky number.
Wait, hold it.
"10225".
That's me!
Go Will.
It is with great pleasure that I present you with this check in the amount of $1,000.
And it is with humongous pleasure that I take this chumpy off your hands.
Can we get a picture of this please?
And now can we get a shot of Will giving the check back to the L.A.P. C?
Wait.
Excuse me?
We'd like a shot of you donating the money back to the L.A.P.C.
Wait.
What?
- You want me to donate $1,000?
- That's the idea.
That's a bad idea.
But it's Club tradition.
Well, we got a club tradition in Philly, too it says if they don't have one, you don't give them your money.
Honest, Geoffrey, it'd make me feel a lot better if you'd just take your money back.
No, thank you.
A gentleman always accepts his losses gracefully.
Okay, Geoffrey, but you're sure we're still friends?
Of course, Miss Ashley.
I just don't understand why you're making such a big deal about this money.
I mean, it ain't like I took the Benz drag racing down Sunset - at 4:00 in the morning.
- Tattletale.
Will, I'm making a big deal because every year the club picks a charity and donates that money to that charity.
But, Uncle Phil, look, if it's supposed to be my money how come I can't do what I wanna do with it?
And I don't wanna donate it to the L.A.P.C.
Will, donating that money is a tradition and a tradition isn't something to be thrown away on a whim.
Whoa, hold up.
You calling a red leather suit with matching seat covers a whim?
Will, you're being awfully selfish.
Obviously, you haven't learned a thing since you've been here.
We've all been blessed.
And donating to someone less fortunate than yourself is not an option it's a responsibility.
I hear what you're saying, Uncle Phil, you're right.
Keeping money that isn't yours is wrong.
Very, very wrong.
I know.
Hey, Ashley, honey, what's up?
Would everyone just get off my case?
I want to give him the money back, but he won't take it.
Whoa, puberty's in the house.
Hey, you looking fine today.
Thanks I did a little something different with my hair.
Hey, here's your boom box.
I re-wired it.
It works fine now.
You owe me 50 cents.
Man, 50 cents?
That's real reasonable.
Hey, a happy customer is a loyal customer.
- How much for the shoe shine?
- $150.
Hey, I gotta make up the differences somewhere.
How else am I gonna get to basketball camp?
All right, well, hey, let's just get out of here before Linda Blair's head starts spinning around.
Good morning, baby.
- Mommy, you look so pretty.
- Thank you.
Hilary's taking your father and me to brunch at the Club today.
I wanted to thank them for being helpful while I organized Monte Carlo night.
The way we all pulled together made me see the importance of family and how truly blessed I am.
What about the rest of us?
We're your family, too.
Yeah, but if I take all of you I won't have enough money left over to buy a hat.
You know what I was thinking?
I'm tired of going to the club, seeing those same old faces all the time.
What say we head down to Denny's for a short stack?
Philip, Hilary wants to take us to the Club for brunch.
After what Will did last night, they're all going to be gossiping about us.
- Why put ourselves through that?
- They won't be gossiping.
Will gave the check back.
Besides, people at our club aren't like that.
I mean, no one cared about Mrs. Silverberg's divorce.
I heard she's been seeing the golf pro.
I heard her husband caught them in the utility closet.
But did you know that both of them were wearing nothing but cleats?
It was the tennis pro in the steam room.
But the cleats part is right.
Kids talk.
You see, Vivian, everybody's looking at us.
No, they aren't.
Vivian, I want to congratulate you on having such a talented daughter.
- Here, in case you need this.
- Thank you, but I don't smoke.
It's gold.
It's worth something.
I thought she was still on the wagon.
Something very strange is going on here.
Excuse me.
Waiter?
Could we have the check, please?
- It's already been taken care of.
- By whom?
By the way, if you need to unload one of your cars, I can give you cash.
I just sold a screenplay.
Excuse me a minute.
Henry!
What in God's name is going on here?
If you needed money, why didn't you come to me instead of making Will keep that check?
It was Will's idea.
I told him to give it back.
Sure.
Sure, old man.
George, would you tell him that Will gave back that check please?
- Well, I'd love to, but he didn't.
- But I told him to.
Well, this is obviously some kind of mistake.
Oh, sure and Mrs. Silverberg was wearing cleats because she forgot her shower shoes.
Geoffrey, I took a piece of gum from your windbreaker.
Quite all right, Miss Ashley.
No, I insist on paying you back.
Here.
A stick of Doublemint costs but a few pennies.
A few pennies, $94.
Why split hairs?
Miss Ashley, you have offended my honor.
Honor schmonor.
It's your male pride.
Miss Ashley!
I'm sorry, Geoffrey, but I'm sick and tired of men acting like pouty babies just because you beat them at something.
Like the time I beat Bobby Greenspan at tetherball.
After that, he told everyone at school that I took steroids.
I apologize, Miss Ashley.
I have acted like an utter fool.
That's all right, Geoffrey.
I had to stuff Bobby Greenspan in his locker before he would apologize.
Man, I finally beat you.
Hey, man, no, the sun was in my eyes.
Man, the same sun was in my eyes.
Stop being a baby.
Hey, man, I ain't being no baby.
And if you beat me again, I'm taking my ball and I ain't being your friend.
Man, I gotta go find G, he got some shoes for me to shine.
Philip, I'm sure Will just hasn't gotten around to returning the check yet.
Vivian, when I tell Will to do something I expect for it to be done.
Hey, Aunt Viv!
Uncle Phil.
Whoa, you got that mad look in your eyes.
Let me guess.
You grabbed Geoffrey's underwear by mistake, am I right?
Will, why didn't you give that check to charity like I told you to?
- What you talking about?
I did.
- Don't stand there and lie to me.
- I'm not lying.
- I just got back from the Club and I've never been so humiliated.
I thought we had an agreement that that money was going to go where it was most needed.
Now, you march upstairs and get me that check.
Well, I can't.
The money's gone.
Will, how could you have spent $1,000 already?
Wow, Will, you must be loaded!
You spent $1,000 and had another $1,000 to give to me for basketball camp?
I gotta raise your shoeshine rate.
You gave the money to Ramon?
Well, you know, it's just a loan, till his sneaker endorsement comes through you know, around 2010.
Will, that was very commendable, but that's not what that money was raised for.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
You said I got a break and I was supposed to give somebody else a break so I gave the money to Ramon.
He's right, Philip, you did say that.
I'll still donate $1,000 to L.A.P.C.
Yeah, that's cool.
But, looky here.
Seeing as how you're in this extremely generous mood I want to know if you was down with donating to the United Negro Nephew Fund.
You know, they say a Saturday night is a terrible thing to waste.
Child, you must be on dog food.
No, see, I ain't down with that country stuff.
Country Here we go, one more time, here it is I thought we had an agreement, that we were gonna give that money to where Be with me, people.
Pray for me now.

Deck the slopes with babes in tight pants Carlton's gonna get some romance No, you're not, 'cause you're too ugly They'll all be in my room, cute and snugly Will, is that all you're taking for the entire Christmas vacation?
No, man.
These just my hair products.
What about your ski clothes?
Carlton skiing is for white guys named Sven and O.J. Simpson.
Will you deprived product of the ghetto skiing is an extremely exhilarating sport.
What is exhilarating about strapping two sticks on your feet flying down a hill at 90 miles an hour and slamming into a tree?
This is L.A., man, if I want to get my head cracked I can star in the next Rodney King video.
Forget it, Ashley, I am not getting you a stun gun for Christmas.
I'm not really going to use it on Cousin Bobby I just want to scare him with it.
Look, we haven't seen him since Aunt Janice's wedding.
Maybe we remember him worse than he is.
Yeah, right, and maybe it was Barbie's idea to catch that tan in the microwave.
All right, since we're all gonna take separate cars to the airport I thought I'd better give you your tickets now.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Baby.
- Thank you.
Daddy, these tickets are all wrong.
They look all right to me, sweetheart.
But Daddy, they're coach.
Better watch it, Hil.
Next thing you know, you'll be riding the bus.
The real estate agent assured Mr. Banks that this cabin sleeps 15 people.
Well, there are 13 of us and only four beds.
Now, I don't know how you do things in England but this family ain't that close.
Look, all I know is Lester and I have been saving up for this trip all year.
We are not sleeping on the floor.
Baby, we're on vacation.
Wherever we lie down, we aren't gonna be sleeping.
Lester how many times I gotta tell you to cut down on that vitamin E?
I am not a machine.
Well, I am.
You gonna let me rock your world?
Get a grip on yourself, Lester.
Don't encourage him.
Mom!
Merry Christmas!
It's so great to see you!
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- Will!
- Hey!
What is that under your nose?
I'm sorry.
It's my mustache, Mom.
Yeah, I know, you hate it.
No, no, baby, it looks great.
Everything is great.
Even your Aunt Helen's mustache is great.
Wait, hold it.
"Everything is great"?
Mom, you okay?
Baby, listen, these days I'm seeing life in a whole new, wonderful way.
This cup is not half empty, it's half full.
Is it half full of Scotch?
Divas!
Janice!
Frank!
How are the newlyweds?
Couldn't be She's just got a little stomach bug.
I better go check on her.
Well, Frank, how are you?
It sure is good to see you.
Really?
I thought you said, "Next time I see that white boy, I hope he's under a bus".
That was just a figure of speech.
Come on, give big sister Vy a hug.
You know, Mom, that was real sweet.
Hey, somebody get an exorcist on the phone.
Look, we didn't come to a ski resort to just stand around and talk.
Now, I'm gonna go upstairs, get into my ski clothes put on my boots, and go shopping.
Well, I better take our bags up to our room.
I got news for you, Philip: This is your room.
Excuse me?
There were only four beds left, and Bobby got the last one.
But for $10, you can use my sleeping bag.
I'm sure if you call the real estate agent, he'll straighten this whole thing out.
I never guaranteed anyone anything.
That's my motto: "Never guarantee anyone anything "and beware of cross-eyed women".
What do you intend to do about this?
Look, folks, I'd really like to help you, but everything's rented.
There's not an empty bed in the whole state.
Well, I guess those cross-eyed women are doing something right.
Enjoy.
Look, it's Christmas.
We're together, we're healthy, it's beautiful.
Vivian's right.
You only live life once I say go for the gusto!
Come on, let's hit the slopes.
Now, wait a minute, Mom.
I don't know about this whole gusto thing.
You don't even know how to ski.
Well, yes, I do.
Robert taught me.
Excuse me would you like to tell me who Robert is?
Robert Watson.
He's a friend of mine.
What do you mean, friend?
You mean like, friend or friend?
We'll talk about it later, baby.
Right now, the slopes are waiting.
Besides, honey, I want you to see my moves.
Has Robert seen your moves?
Come on, Phil.
We got time to get a good two hours of skiing in before dinner.
Well, hold it right there, Jean-Claude.
I hope you're planning to take some skiing lessons.
I don't need lessons.
I know how to ski.
Just keep him comfortable.
Forget comfortable.
He's lucky I'm keeping him at all.
Ever scare me like that again Daddy.
When you were rolling down that big hill you looked just like Gumby.
Yeah, Uncle Les.
And you sounded like Patti LaBelle.
Aunt Janice, you don't look like you feel too well.
Maybe you should go shopping.
What's the matter, honey?
You're not pregnant, are you?
It's a possibility.
Oh, Janice, that's wonderful!
Oh, baby that's great.
I couldn't be happier.
You couldn't?
Well, listen now, when the love between two people is strong enough well, that love will conquer all.
This Robert must have a magic wand.
This is going to be a great Christmas.
- Aunt Vy is in love.
- Yes, child.
Janice is going to have a baby.
Keep your voice down.
Frank doesn't know yet.
I'm not even sure.
Well, get a home pregnancy test.
All you do is fill the little tube with well, you know.
If it turns blue you're pregnant, if it doesn't you're not.
Oh, grow up.
Here we are in the lovely state of Utah.
Don't ask me why.
The only black people I've seen been in the Ray Charles Pepsi commercial.
You're kidding.
Every time I turn around, I see a black person.
So, so, so did you whiz in the tube?
Oh, it's upstairs.
I'm afraid to look at it by myself.
I want all of you guys to share this with me.
Come on, girl.
This is a pregnancy test, not an order of nachos.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
In honor of this rare and special occasion I've compiled a special holiday medley.
And it goes a little something like this.
Hey, y'all, how about some real music?
Let's see what's on the radio.
Philip and I used to tear up the dance floor on this song.
What do you mean "used to," baby?
Hold on.
Hey, come on, one-leg daddy!
Let's show them how it's really done!
Yo, hey, check it out!
It's old time at the Apollo!
Come on, let's go down to the lodge.
We'll be appreciated.
Huh?
The Christmas party starts in 15 minutes.
Man, I sure wish Robbie was here.
He certainly would enjoy this.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold it.
Wait a minute, Mom.
Who is this Robert guy?
I mean, where did you meet him at?
I mean, what does he do for a living?
- Where's his parents - Good night, Will.
Hey!
You be back here by 10:00!
And don't make me have to come down there and get you!
Who could that be?
That's probably Donny and Marie coming over to borrow a cup of rhythm.
Hi.
I'm Arnold Tish.
My car broke down.
- Can I use your phone?
- Oh, sure.
Whoa, whoa.
Hold up a second, my man.
Will, why'd you do that?
Carlton, you suburban twit, this guy's a stranger.
Will, it is freezing outside.
Let him in.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Unless he is on a mule with a pregnant virgin he ain't getting in here.
Will, wouldn't you want someone to help you if you were in his shoes?
I didn't even see his shoes and I'd help him.
Will, it's Christmas.
Yeah.
Aren't the holidays about sharing?
All right, all right, let him in.
- Come on in, my man.
- I'll get the phone for you.
Why don't you have a nice seat by the fireplace?
- What did you say your name was again?
- Arnold.
Hi, Arnold, nice to meet you.
Hey, my man, Arnold.
Why don't you say Merry Christmas for the camera?
Merry Christmas.
Could I say one more thing?
Yeah.
Hurry up though, I'm about to run out of tape.
Okay.
Nobody move, this is a stick-up.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Bobby, honey, how many times I have to tell you?
Don't tie up the family!
The creep even took the toilet paper.
Don't ask me how I know.
He took my home pregnancy test, too.
Well, maybe he'll call in with the results.
I'll get it.
Gosh, I'm glad I came.
Hi, there.
Boy, howdy!
Looks like you folks have been picked cleaner than Pavarotti's chicken bones.
Wait a minute, I thought you were the real estate agent.
I am.
I'm also the Sheriff notary public mortician and I'm a pretty good little dancer, too.
Let me guess there's a lot of marriage between first cousins in this town, right?
Okay, let me see if I got this right: He's a short, tall, medium-height Caucasian male with strawberry, dirty-blond brown hair weighing somewhere between 125 and 200 pounds.
Yep, that's him.
And the dude'll be carrying my boom box.
Right.
What the hell is a boom box?
So, Sheriff, what are the chances of us getting our stuff back?
Can I be honest with you?
Please do.
Buy all new stuff.
Merry Christmas.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
Why don't we just try and get some sleep?
It's not quite that simple.
There are only enough beds for seven of us, remember?
Well, I'm not sleeping with anyone but Lester.
- Except maybe Denzel Washington.
- Yes, ma'am!
Look, I know how to settle this.
Everybody who chipped in on renting this cabin gets a bed.
Time out, time out.
That means all the kids have to sleep on the floor.
- Works for me.
- Works for me.
Will?
Will, are you asleep?
No, Carlton, I'm doing homeboy yoga.
Will I was really scared tonight.
Yeah, Carlton, you're scared of zipper-fly jeans.
Come on.
I mean, weren't you scared, just a little bit?
What, are you tripping, man?
Scared?
I was petrified, man.
If Ashley hadn't slapped me, man, I might have screamed.
I'll tell you one thing: What happened tonight made me realize how precious life is.
And I promised myself that I would always make sure I let my family know how much I love them.
So I just want to say I love you, Will.
Aren't you gonna say it back?
I know how you feel, even if you won't say it.
If there is an ounce of decency left in you just tell him you love him.
It's okay, Ash.
I love you, man.
All right?
I love you!
I love you!
I love you, too.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right.
- What's so merry about it?
If no one else is gonna put up a front, neither am I. This is the worst damn Christmas I've ever had!
And look at this fool.
So, Geoffrey what's for breakfast?
Hot water and chewing gum, sir.
You mean he stole the food, too?
Hey, look what I found.
A tea bag.
Hey, it ain't a Belgian waffle but it'll do.
- Pass it around.
- You know what?
This reminds me of the Christmas that Mama got laid off from work and she brought us home those dolls, remember?
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she couldn't afford their clothes, so she told us they were topless.
I remember one Christmas I wanted a set of drums so bad.
Mama and Papa couldn't afford them so they set up the pots and pans like drums.
I wailed on those things till suppertime.
Then Mama had to take them apart so she could cook, you know?
Does that mean you're gonna go out and make me a Miata?
No, sweetheart, but I am gonna give you a gift.
This year I'm going to give my family less of my money and more of myself.
For my gift, I'm going to make sure that this family stays close.
Seeing my family just once a year just isn't enough.
Well, I'm giving Helen my ears because sometimes what she says makes more sense than I give her credit for.
Well, I'm gonna try to speak softer so maybe I'll be easier to listen to.
I'm going to try and be more like my aunts and my mother who are all warm wonderful, strong, black women.
- That's cute!
- Thank you.
For my Christmas gift I'm gonna give Ashley a noogie.
I am going to give Bobby five seconds before I ram that video game down his throat!
Well, you've already given me my gift.
I've got Janice and I'm proud to be a part of this family.
And I am going to throw up.
Oh, baby.
Now, there's a gift for the person who has everything.
- Hey, I'm just gonna go check on her.
- No, no, no, you don't.
That's Frank's job.
Come on, it's your turn.
I guess my gift to you, Mom, is Is me.
Mama, you don't need that Robert.
Thanks, baby, but I already have one of you.
I guess, then, I'm gonna try to be more understanding.
Just don't come around here with no babies.
Oh, Will, you're my only baby.
Madam, sir this family is as close to me as my very own.
My gift to you will be a set of hand towels.
I'm British.
I'm no good at this mushy stuff.
You ain't no good at picking Christmas gifts, neither.
Merry Christmas, folks.
I got good news.
We got the guy who robbed you.
That's great!
He didn't get very far.
Nope.
The tire blew out on your rental car and he slammed right into the courthouse nativity scene.
Baby Jesus went through the windshield and knocked him out cold.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Oh, yes!
But the bad news is, he'd already unloaded all your stuff.
Except for one thing.
Someone in this room is pregnant.
Boy, don't you even think it.
Congratulations, and Happy Kwanzaa.
Honey remember that night when I said, "Better safe than sorry"?
Sorry.
Holy smokes.
Hey, wait a minute.
I didn't get to give my Christmas gift.
It's a holiday medley, and it's dedicated to Janice and Frank.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
You guys are drowning me out.
My gift to you was a solo.
No, no, Carlton, you can still sing solo so low that we can't hear you.

I'm sorry, Hil, but I can't.
I've got to study for my med school entrance exam.
Oh, right.
Well, great.
When your looks go, they'll still respect you.
So, Cindy, where do you want to do lunch tomorrow?
Sorry, Hil, I have an interview with an IBM recruiter.
Well, God.
Everyone's got something to do but me.
Maybe I should get a job.
- Look, I'm telling you man, it'd be cool.
- I'm not No one's gonna believe you're a nuclear physicist.
You have trouble working the pumps on your shoes.
Let me check in with my fan club.
So, I got a little question for you all.
Do you all see me more as a biblical scholar or a nuclear physicist?
I see you as an extra from Hook.
You better watch it before I make you walk the plank.
If I'm gonna find a dress for my interview, we better get going.
I can't.
Do you believe my parents have called some family meeting?
I mean, do I look like a Huxtable?
Great, you're all together.
Will, we've got something to say to you.
We want to congratulate you for setting such a fine example for the other kids.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
No, baby, not at all.
We are very proud of the way you've managed to balance your school work and your part-time job.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
These bills are no joke.
You kids could stand to learn a thing or two from Will.
Are we, like, in the Twilight Zone?
When does everyone put on the pig masks?
Carlton, $90 for a pair of socks?
- That's ridiculous.
- It certainly is!
Honey, that's $9.
Ashley, how could you manage to charge $80 worth of trinkets on our account at the drug store?
That's 80 cents.
Sweetie, do you think you need to get your eyes checked?
Don't be ridiculous, Vivian.
This has been going on for months.
If you move the TV any closer to the bed I'll be sleeping with Jay Leno.
I can see just fine.
They're just making the print smaller than they used to.
Now, this looks like $300 for a pair of shoes, what's it say?
- $300 dollars for shoes.
- Point being?
- Kids we'd like to talk to Hilary alone.
- Yes, sir.
I think I'll slide out and simonize my halo.
Hilary, when you quit college we made an agreement that you would pay your own way.
Hilary, most of these bills are yours.
You spend more on clothes than most small countries spend on grain.
You're gonna have to find yourself a job, young lady and you're gonna have to keep it for longer than one day.
Okay, you're right.
I haven't lived up to my end of the bargain and I feel terrible, I really do.
Okay, I'm making a New Year's resolution to find a job.
Right after Easter.
Vivian, I can't take this anymore.
Hilary, at your age I shouldn't have to do this.
No, Daddy, no!
This is going to hurt me much more than it hurts you.
I want you to reach into that purse and give me your credit cards.
Now, young lady!
Yes, hi, I'm Dr. Smith.
Sorry I'm late, I had to slide down to the nuclear facility and split an atom.
I give up.
I can't get a job.
I can't even pound the pavement right.
I guess your interview didn't go too good, huh?
It's just not fair.
I want my employer to want me for me, not for what I've accomplished.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, Hil, I do and it scares the hell out of me.
Tomorrow's just gonna be more of the same.
I'm interviewing at a catering company, but I'll never get the job.
Because it's a cold, cold world, Will.
And unfortunately these people only want one thing.
- What?
Your body?
- No, my résumé.
Let me look at it.
All right here we go.
Well, first things first.
If you're gonna want people to take you seriously you're gonna have to stop dotting your I's with these little hearts.
And you're applying for a position at a catering company?
Yes, but I don't know anything about catering.
Well, girl, what are you, tripping?
How many catered affairs have you been to?
I don't know, 4 maybe 500.
Okay, there we go.
Didn't you spend, like, three summers in Paris?
Yes.
I gained 10 pounds eating croissants.
Studied pastry making with the French masters.
Will, I am no good in the kitchen.
I mean, the last time I tried to make breakfast I burned the entire stove to a crisp.
Expert in the art of flambé.
- Hey.
- Hi, Will.
Philip, you really should get your eyes checked.
I'll make an appointment to see the eye doctor tomorrow.
- Tyriq, Will's upstairs, I'll go get him.
- That's okay, Ashley, I'll get him.
Yo, Will!
It's Ty!
- You're sure he heard you?
- You know, that's a good point.
You got a broom?
I mean, I could go bang on the ceiling.
Why you got my shirt on, man?
Hey, wait.
What you talking about, your shirt?
You said you weren't gonna buy it.
I said I wouldn't buy it if I were you.
I got the shoulders for it.
That shirt looks good on anyone.
All the guys in the eighth grade have one.
- I'm gonna take mine back, man.
- Yeah, all right, well, me, too.
You know, I better return mine before my scent overpowers it.
I think you guys are spending too much time together.
How'd the interview go?
You are looking at the new catering director for Delectable Eats.
I am single-handedly overseeing a bar mitzvah for 200 people this Saturday.
- I'm so happy for you.
- Congratulations, baby.
Mom, Dad, this time I think I've really found my niche and I owe it all to you.
This is so exciting.
Why don't you help me fix dinner?
Please.
You can't afford me.
- You said you was gonna take yours back.
- Come on, now, man, look.
I deserve to keep the shirt because I was in eighth grade the longest.
Come on, this definitely ain't gonna do nothing for the misconception that all brothers look alike.
Right, wait.
What are we doing here, anyway?
I thought you said we were going to the Bar Mista?
It's "bar mitzvah," dunce cap.
The Bar Mista is a go-go joint on Sunset.
Oh, thanks guys.
Could you get the rest of the stuff out of the car?
Yeah, we'll grab that, but I told you we gotta get out of here.
We get to meet who we got matched up with today.
I don't want to miss out on a lovely young lady who thinks I'm Arsenio's younger brother, Vesuvia.
Barb, hi.
So, what do you think?
Hil, hi, everything looks wonderful.
You are a gem.
Now remember, the serving crew should wear the new aprons I bought.
- By the way, where is the serving crew?
- Serving crew?
By that you mean, the crew that serves?
Are they in the party room?
By that you mean, the room where the party is?
Now the serving crew is not in the party room at this point in time, Barb because you see, they're right here.
Hi, serving crew.
What a great idea, Hilary, I love the matching shirts.
My son in eighth grade has one.
Well, I must dash, see you this evening.
Ciao.
Thanks guys, you saved me.
Do you think you could stay and help serve?
Do I look like Hazel?
Look, Hilary, I told you, we have something to do, we can't stay.
Okay.
If I lose this job, I guess I can always sell my hair.
That's cool.
Just make sure Uncle Phil pays you top dollar for it.
Hilary, I told you from the beginning that we were gonna have to go, now don't try to pull this.
What kind of monster are you?
All right, look, Hil look, me and Ty got to meet our dates but we'll go home and we'll get the others to help you.
Okay, but don't tell Mom and Dad, I don't want them to think I'm messing up.
All right, look, that's fine, we won't, but the others, good as here.
Forget it, Will.
I'd rather share a seesaw with Delta Burke.
You know how hard it is for me to say no?
No.
Easier than I thought.
Neat.
I don't believe you two.
Hilary is your sister.
Look, if it weren't for her, man, you Every time you've been in a jam, she Hey, she's always the first one Hilary's your sister.
What a tangled web we weave.
First you lied on your dating application then you lied on Hilary's résumé.
A lie always comes back to haunt you.
Sort of like that heat rash on your neck that you've been passing off in gym class as a hickey?
Enough said.
See, look, it won't be that bad, man.
How hard can it be to serve a couple of 13-year-old boys?
After all, Hilary's my sister.
All right, thanks, now I just gotta try to get G to come.
You know how tight he is with his days off.
Hey, G!
Big, big party, man.
Plenty of honeys.
No.
Well, G's probably right.
How much fun could you have with chumpies named Di, Fergie, and Elizabeth?
I mean, you know.
He's lying.
It's clearly a lie.
It's a blatant, bold-faced lie!
I'll hate myself in the morning.
What's the point of a bar mitzvah, anyway?
It's when a Jewish boy becomes a man.
In front of all these people?
- Where is the princess?
- Here I am.
Geoffrey, you have saved my life, as usual.
Thank you so much for helping me on your day off.
Miss Hilary, it will be my pleasure to help you in your hour of need.
As for you, there is a special place for you in homeboy hell.
Well, Hil, it looks like you all set.
Me and Ty are about to break out.
I need you.
No.
Okay, no.
It's not gonna work this time.
But you're the one who said that I could do this job.
Hilary, listen, I told you all day we had to go.
All right, look, just stop it now, okay?
Stop it!
Ty, look, she really needs our help, man, she's in a jam.
Can we help her out?
All right.
Okay, but, you know, not for long because this is my one chance to date a woman who doesn't wear all her gold in her mouth.
Just 20 minutes.
We'll be out of here in 20 minutes.
Great!
Okay, servers let's go out and show those partygoers the best darn time they've ever had!
Say it once, say it loud, we've got brie and we're proud!
We've got brie and we're proud, Hilary.
What is wrong with you, child?
They're out there.
Well, Hilary, other than the pork thing, they're pretty much just like us.
I'm talking about Cindy and Krista.
If my friends see me serving food, I'll be the laughingstock of Bel-Air!
Hilary, don't be ridiculous.
Carlton's the laughingstock of Bel-Air.
Besides, you're the caterer.
You can't hide in the kitchen all night!
You're right.
They might come in here.
What are you Hilary!
You know, ever since you got a job I've been working my butt off!
Blacks and Jews have a lot in common.
Cherished heritage, a strong sense of community frizzy hair.
Oh, look, a Donna Karan suit right in the middle of the kitchen floor!
What color?
You gotta come out and see that.
Sorry, Will, it won't work.
Look, G, she won't listen to me, man.
I give up.
I think it's time you came out of the closet!
Let me.
Sonny, what you do in the privacy of the bedroom is nobody's business but yours.
Just be true to yourself!
He'll come around.
That's it.
If you don't come out, I'm coming in.
Miss Hilary, will you please be sensible?
My friends are out there, Geoffrey.
One of them is going to go to medical school the other one landed a job with IBM if they see me out there serving, they're gonna think I'm a big fat zero.
What matters is what you think about yourself.
Maybe in Des Moines.
This is L.A., okay?
Besides, I lied to get this job and now I can't do it.
I quit.
Miss Hilary?
Remember when you were 9, you begged your parents to buy you a violin.
But five minutes into your first lesson, what did you do?
I quit.
I had to, it irritated my chin.
And what about ballet?
I quit.
I had to, I was starting to get feet like Fred Flintstone.
And cheerleading?
Okay, I quit that, too.
But they wanted me to go to away games on a bus!
Miss Hilary, you can't go through life quitting everything.
You'll never achieve anything unless you stick with something and you should stick with this because you've done a truly remarkable job on this party.
Can't remember when I've seen you this happy.
Yeah, but, Geoffrey, what difference does it make?
I mean, do you really see Cindy saying: "Wow, you've just got to meet my friend, Hilary Banks.
"She can sculpt cauliflower into a bust of Barbra Streisand"!
There's nothing demeaning about serving others, young lady.
I'm very good at my job and in that I take great pride.
I'm not as strong as you are, Geoffrey.
Oh, no?
Well, I had a hand in raising you, Miss Hilary and if I do say so myself Geoffrey don't raise no fools.
Now if you love this job as much as I think you do go out there, pick up a tray and enter that room as if you were the Queen of England.
But she's so dowdy.
Can I be Princess Caroline instead?
Get busy, Princess.
That's it, Hilary.
I am sick and tired of your attitude.
Okay?
Now you get your spoiled butt up out of this closet and you go out there and you strut your puffs!
I'm a bad boy, ain't I?
She's in a jam, man.
Can we help her out?
Okay, man, but, you know, not for long this is my one time to date a woman who doesn't wear all her gold in her mouth.
And you're all, I But you're the one who said that I could do this job.
Look, Hilary, come on.
The That was so articulate!
English
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
It is so nice to have the house all to ourselves.
It sure is.
Now, why is it that we wanted kids?
'Cause of the way you get them.
- Who that?
- What, what?
Who that say they gonna beat Will Smith?
What, what?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, we did it, we won again.
We 4-and-0.
And at our next game, there's gonna be a recruiter from Georgetown University.
That's great, kids.
Why don't you go upstairs, get my wallet and take your friends to the movies?
In Pittsburgh.
Sorry about the unexpected guests, Dad.
And, as manager of the team, I take full responsibility.
That's very honorable, son.
You're grounded.
Philip, I think it's nice that the kids feel welcome and want to be around us.
Actually, we got kicked out of six other people's cribs and a 7-Eleven parking lot.
But, you mind if we just hang around here and, you know, order a couple of pizzas or something?
It is a very special night for you, Will.
Sure.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
And you know what, man, this just feels great 'cause I remember a time when me and you didn't get along so good.
All the yelling and screaming.
You telling me, "Get on the first plane back to Philly".
Hey, but this is now, and that was this morning.
Yo, Ty, man, what took you so long?
Hey, you ever try going to seven fast food joints on a city bus?
No, I'm saving that for prom night.
Okay, you got your ribs.
- Oh, man, you got your fried chicken.
- Yes, sir.
- Your hot wings.
- Yeah!
Your smokey links, your barbecue kielbasa and a bean pie fresh from the corner.
Yes, sir.
- Hey, you want some hot sauce on that?
- Oh, yeah.
Needs a little bit more.
Will, you shouldn't be eating that garbage!
Everyone knows, while you're in training no fats, no chocolate, and no women!
Then I should probably cancel my date with that fat, chocolate woman.
Will, you pitiful Maalox poster child.
Get that grease buffet out of here and let's go to the game.
Malibu Prep is playing Brentley High tonight and I want you to check out Malibu's guard, Marcus Stokes.
I'm from Philly, homes, ain't nobody from Malibu gonna beat me in basketball.
Besides, I'm the greatest, I'm a bad man, and I'm pretty.
Will, you better listen to me if you want me to be your manager.
My manager?
I don't even want you to be my cousin.
I didn't hear that.
He say he don't even want you to be his cousin.
Fine.
I'll just go to the game myself, and when I get back I'll tell Dad that little circle in your wallet's not your lucky half-dollar.
Shall we take my car or the Volvo?
Malibu leads by 10.
Stokes passes to Jameson, Jameson back to Stokes.
Stokes calls time-out.
I'll say one thing for Malibu, the babes are primo-delecto.
Surf's up.
And that ain't all.
That must be jam, 'cause jelly don't shake like that.
Yo, Slimmy, need some help with your African American studies?
We can go to my place and let freedom ring.
We're in the final quarter of this ball game.
Stokes will take the ball out at halfcourt.
He passes in to Miller, Miller back to Stokes.
Stokes shoots the jumper.
Bingo!
This kid doesn't miss.
Brentley down, shoots, no soap.
They've been throwing up dead bricks all night.
Pelicans rebound.
Marcus the Great brings the ball down court.
He looks left, spins right.
Swish!
Stokes is a one-man gang!
Wow!
Did you see Marcus Stokes jump?
Luck.
How is that luck?
He's lucky I'm not out there.
Carlton, the brother's from Malibu.
The only tough break he had is when the Izod shop ran out of pink.
God, I hate when that happens.
Hey, Coach Smiley, what's going on?
Shut up, Smith.
Can't you see I'm incognito?
Give me 20 laps first thing Monday.
No, wait, I don't want you hurting your legs before the big game.
Banks, do his laps for him.
So, what do you see, Coach?
Not a damn thing, Will, it's part of the disguise.
Stokes has the ball, he moves to his right.
Drives to the hoop, a reverse lay-up.
He scores!
Stokes dribbles.
Takes a pass, takes it strong to the hoop again.
It's in!
Stokes has done everything tonight except sell hot dogs.
Stokes steals the ball, drives the paint.
Oh, my goodness, how sweet it is.
Marcus!
Three seconds left, Stokes with a jumper.
Swish!
The game is over!
In my opinion, Marcus Stokes is gonna be one hell of a college basketball player.
Hey, Marcus, what's up, man?
Will Smith, you probably recognize me from my picture in the sports page.
They said that I'm a superbly well-oiled machine with the face of an angel and the body of a god.
Maybe that's not an exact quote.
No, I don't recognize the face, brother.
But I do recognize them ears.
They covered up half of "Dear Abby".
Hey, you had a pretty cute game out there tonight.
I'm glad you enjoyed it, 'cause I'm gonna do the same thing to your butt next week.
I'm glad you're familiar with that because my butt is the only part of my anatomy you gonna see next week.
Oh, really?
I'll bring a couple of umbrellas for you and that scout because I'm gonna be raining jump shots.
Hey, hold up, I'm the only reason that scout is coming in the first place.
Only scout looking for you is trying to sell you some cookies.
I like your style, Will, I definitely like your style but let me be the first to congratulate you ahead of time for being voted Most Likely to Bag my Groceries.
Yeah?
Well, I got just one thing to say to you, Mr. Hot Shot.
You may be tall and good-looking and a good basketball player but you're not that nice.
You back again for another pre-game haircut?
How you doing, young blood?
Just a poor black man trying to make it in Bel-Air, Mr. Nelson.
What do you say, Joe?
Hey, somebody want to know the future?
The girls like it.
I'm sure they do, they can check their makeup in it.
I heard about your last game.
Boy, you was awesome.
How many points you score?
A mere 30 points an insignificant 18 rebounds, a minuscule 14 assists.
In other words, for a small fee, I might be persuaded to date your daughters.
Boy, you ain't never gonna be that good.
Boy, back in my day, we used to play basketball down in North Carolina.
We ain't had no sneakers, so we played in high-top combat boots.
And we ain't had no basketball, so we used a brick.
And we ain't had no hoop so Cousin Junebug would hold his arms out in a circle like this.
And all day long we slam dunked that brick off Junebug's head.
Them was tough days, boy.
Good thing you all wasn't into archery.
All right.
Now here's my hero.
How you doing, Marcus?
- What's up, everybody?
- Hey.
Joe, nice hair.
You keep saving these up, one day you'll have a sideburn.
Just because the roof blew off don't mean there ain't a log on the fire.
So, what is up, Little Willie?
Ain't nothing to it, shorty.
I see you slumming, what you doing down here in the hood?
This may be the hood to you, brother, but this is home to me.
What're you talking about?
I live two blocks away from here, man.
Born and raised.
Wait, I thought you lived out in Malibu.
I know you thought I did.
You thought I was some snot-nosed, candy-pants preppy.
But I'm your worst nightmare on a basketball court, money.
I'm a homeboy, just like you.
So, wait a minute.
You ride a bus 20 miles a day to Malibu Prep?
Nope.
I run.
Bingo.
My main man.
Will, what you doing back so soon?
You know my haircuts don't have no warranties.
Tonight's the big game, I wanted to come in and get a special trim.
Don't cut me too short, though.
I don't want you give me no "Hair Jordan".
If the people say you look pretty tonight be sure and mention Nelson's Golden Shears.
Our motto is: "It may be nappy, but we'll make it snappy".
Has Marcus been around?
I seen him once or twice.
He got his game face on?
Afraid so.
So he wasn't fronting?
Hey, he really does live around here?
Yeah, he grew up right around the corner.
Come from a good family, too.
Got six of the prettiest sisters you ever seen.
I believe the oldest one think I'm kind of cute.
Marcus been playing ball over at Harriet Tubman Park since he was 6 years old.
Tough little rascal he was, too.
He used to play on the asphalt in his socks.
Mother couldn't afford sneakers, you know.
Sounds like he was about as tough as I was.
Yeah, I used to play barefoot on glass.
Why?
Marcus' mother been working at the phone company ever since I can remember.
And the kid's got so many jobs, he could be Jamaican.
My mom had about four jobs, and I had three myself.
I was the only kid in preschool who knew how to downshift a big rig.
And I'm gonna amaze that Georgetown scout tonight.
A few years from now I'll be dunking baskets in the NBA Marcus will be dunking donuts in a deep fryer.
Which pro team you gonna play with?
My daddy says I can play with a pro team.
Not so fast, Junior, you got a ways to go yet.
"Junior"?
Yeah, Will, this is my son.
This is my son.
My son.
Well, here we are.
Have the house all to ourselves.
All alone.
Just you and me.
Will, I got Tyson, Holyfield, Dr. J Dr. Ruth, and Dr. Pepper.
Only in America.
Sorry things didn't work out at the donut shop.
And another thing, take this $1,000 bill and wipe your baby's nose.
Go, Will.
Wait a minute, this is whack.
Hey, I don't even know if this baby is mine.
Hello, Dada?
How you going to play a baby?
Will.
Wake up.
Come on, it's time for the game.
Oh, man.
I dreamed you had hair like Don King.
Did I look taller?
So, you ready to show that scout what we're made of?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Guess so?
What kind of attitude is that for a champ?
Come on.
Hey, Carlton.
You, you think it's rough having a kid?
I don't think so.
You just hand out cigars and hope its head rounds out.
All right, men, we've come a long way and I just want to say, "Good luck".
That, and pass it to Will.
One, two, three, Bel-Air!
All right, it's showtime, baby!
Yes, sir, and I am the master of ceremonies.
And here's the tip-off.
Look at Will Smith leap!
He taps the ball to Jones, Jones back to Smith.
And Smith draws first blood for Bel-Air Prep.
Marcus Stokes has the ball for Malibu.
Driving the lane and scoring.
Stokes looking for the open man, takes the jumper for two points.
Will Smith coming right back at it.
In your face!
Call the fire department, Stokes and Smith are smoking.
Smith steals the ball, driving the lane, a lay-up!
He's poetry in motion.
Marcus has the ball, he drives, swish!
It's been Smith and Stokes all night.
Jump shot, Will Smith.
He's got 30 points.
Stokes shoots the jumper.
It's money in the bank.
Stokes falls back on defense.
This has been an old-fashioned barnburner.
Bel-Air Prep by two points.
Stokes and Smith could start their own pro team!
Holy mackerel, another two points for Will Smith.
Stokes comes right back at him.
He drives, and lays it in.
These two kids are magnificent.
Have you ever seen anything like it?
Smith dribbles up court.
He stops, he pops, it drops.
Two points.
This one is too close to call and these fans are loving every minute of it.
Stokes looks tired but there's fire in his eyes.
Smith is playing the game of his life.
Stokes shoots.
In your face, Will Smith.
It doesn't get any better than this!
Smith bringing the ball down court.
His face a mask of concentration.
He drives towards Stokes.
He fires the rock.
In your face, Marcus Stokes.
Bel-Air Prep by one point.
Time-out with 15 seconds left.
All right, men, now think defense.
Will, Stokes is your man, I want you to stick to him like white on rice.
Sorry, it's a bad analogy.
- One, two, three, Bel Air!
- Let's go.
Hey, what's going on, Uncle Phil?
You okay?
Yeah, you know.
Guess I really blew it in front of that scout tonight, huh?
Son, you can't come down on yourself for losing.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
There'll be other scouts.
I know.
I just felt like I really let everybody down.
My game just wouldn't come together tonight.
Trust me, Will.
I know it doesn't feel like it right now but what they say is true.
Winning really isn't everything.
Yeah, well, it is to Marcus Stokes.
How you doing, sir?
I'm Marcus Stokes.
- I'm Philip Banks, Will's uncle.
- Nice to meet you.
- You play a hell of a game, son.
- Thank you, sir.
- Will, we'll see you at home?
- Okay.
Hey, man, I was waiting around for you in the locker room.
Why'd you let me go around you like that?
What, you tripping, man?
I didn't let you go around me.
I know your game, Will.
You let me go around you.
If you were gonna play like that, why didn't you just sit in the stands?
Look, come on, man, you impressed the scout.
You'll go to a Division One college, then you'll go pro.
You'll be able to get your kid everything.
What're you beefing about?
Oh, I get it.
'Cause I got a kid, I'm some kind of charity case?
Let's get something straight, homey.
My situation does not define who I am, I define who I am.
Look, man.
I got lucky, all right.
You know, I got a rich uncle.
A lot of brothers coming from where we come from they don't have the same opportunities.
That's your ticket.
You know something, my Bel-Air brother?
You been watching too many made-for-TV movies.
Hey, look, man, I'm from Philly, I know it ain't easy to make it.
What?
To make it to the pros?
It's damn near impossible.
Look, I'm better than good, till I break my ankle, that is.
Then I ain't worth a dime.
I'm not depending on this.
I'm depending on this.
My b-ball scholarship is gonna get me a free education in engineering so that I can provide for my family with my mind.
- You don't even want to play pro?
- Yo, I ain't no fool, now.
If somebody offered me a million dollars to dribble a basketball you better believe I'm gonna take it.
All due respect, my brother I don't think nobody's gonna offer you no million dollars.
What I'm saying is the odds of that happening are slim.
Me getting an education that's gonna last me a lifetime are the odds that I'm taking.
You know, you are a pretty deep brother.
Yeah.
And I'm a better ballplayer than you, too.
Them's be fighting words.
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
- Hey, that's what you want, right?
- That's what I want.
You sure that's what you want?
All right.
You're driving.
- You sure this is what you want?
- Give it to me as hard as you can.
When you go home you gotta tell them what I did to you, right?
- What did you say?
- I'm gonna give it to you real hard.
Where you going?
Take a look at you.
Smith has the ball.
He dribbles, he drives between the legs.
He stops, he pops.
And it's good!
The crowd goes wild.
Oh, Smith hurt his ankle.
He hurt his ankle.
It's over, he cannot play.
Smith wins, 1-0.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Geoffrey, it's almost 6:00 and we're gonna go out to eat.
Why don't you take the rest of the night off?
Thank you, madam.
I could really use the time to myself.
Hey, G, can you get me some water, man?
Hold up, y'all missed it.
It was great.
It was the battle of the Abduls.
Kareem versus Paula.
Don't make fun of Paula.
She's the only woman short enough to be my wife.
Geoffrey, I need some Tylenol and a cold cloth for my head.
Work sucks.
But you already know that, don't you?
Geoffrey, would you get me a drink?
Thank you.
Today one of our biggest clients threatened to leave the firm and you'll never guess why.
Could you leave it in a note, sir?
I have the night off.
They had the nerve to say they wanted to be represented by someone younger.
Hey, I'm young, I'm happening, I'm groovy.
Why do I have the sudden urge to tie dye my drawers and go down to the hootenanny?
Will, this is no time to joke.
We may be talking about the end of life as we know it.
Look, what if all Dad's clients figure out he's old?
It's the domino theory.
First he loses one client, then another, and another and the next thing you know, we're all working at Domino's.
You'll fit right in.
You're used to cutting the cheese.
Dad, if you want to play hardball with the movers and shakers you've got to get up first thing in the morning, head out and buy yourself some stone washed jeans.
You know, that's a good idea, Carlton.
All that denim will take his clients' eyes off his bald spot.
I have no problem being bald.
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with a receding hairline.
That's more like a hair cul-de-sac.
This is ridiculous.
Besides baldness is dignified.
Yeah, it's also hereditary.
I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm Karen from across the street.
Hot diggity dog, where have you been all my life?
You're from the Geller's?
I'm Geoffrey, the Banks' butler.
May I help you?
That's not all you can do, Mr. French.
I was wondering if you could lend me a cup of Lysol?
Where's the regular housekeeper, Rose?
Like I give a damn.
She's on vacation.
Like I give a damn.
Anyway, I dropped some jam on the parquet floor.
If I may be so bold, you might try liquid wax and a very fine steel wool.
I haven't met a man who knew so much about cleaning since my late husband.
Late?
I'm so sorry.
Would you care to join me for some tea?
Well, perhaps I could have one cup.
The croissants look good.
And your buns aren't bad either.
Nice buns.
Buns?
You read my mind.
- Karen?
- Yes?
Would you like to Bad, teatime.
- Hey, how you doing?
I'm Will.
- I'm Karen.
- You gonna eat this?
- Not anymore.
Well, I guess I better be getting back.
Let me know if you need anything.
Dust rags, furniture wax, a massage.
My God.
I hope I didn't say that out loud.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
Thanks for the tea.
Looks like G just got busy, English style.
She's a fellow domestic, nothing more.
G, you're wiping the table with a croissant, man.
Vivian, tell me something.
Do you think I'm getting old?
Honey, that's just your imagination.
Nobody thinks you're old.
Dad, you know how everyone's saying you're old?
I've got something that's gonna make you look years younger.
Philip Banks, this is your hair.
Carlton, I am not wearing a toupee.
That's the problem.
Now work with me on this.
Your clients are going to be at that party Saturday night.
You've got to show him a hipper, hairier Philip Banks.
Say, is that Philip Banks, or Blair Underwood?
What do you think of this one, Dad?
I look like Little Richard, Attorney at Law.
Dinner is served.
- Philip!
- Combing.
I'm coming.
Dinner is served.
Here are the condiments for your fish.
Tartar sauce, dill sauce, lemon wedges and parsley butter.
Great.
Where's the fish?
Spoiling off the coast of Nova Scotia?
I knew I forgot something.
I'll see what else we have.
Has Geoffrey been sniffing the 409?
- No, his nose is open.
- That explains it.
What the hell does that mean?
Geoffrey's in love.
No, Geoffrey is not.
Would anyone care for a cocktail weenie?
I guess I forgot to go to the grocery store.
Okay, anybody up for dinner at the club?
Not bad.
Got them all to myself.
G, we got some of that squirt cheese?
Who am I kidding?
My nose is as open as a 7-Eleven.
G, I don't understand why Just pick up the phone and ask her out.
I wouldn't know what to say.
Karen is different.
She's so cultured, she's so refined.
She can read.
Look, G, it's not what you say, it's what you don't say.
All right, whatever you do, don't tell her you like her.
Whatever you do, don't tell her that you want to go out with her.
You know, and whatever you do, don't ever say the "P" word.
- The "P" word?
- Yeah, "please".
If you ain't Barry White, you ain't got to beg.
I'll give it a try.
Hello?
Karen, this is Geoffrey.
I just wanted to tell you how much I like you.
- No, G, no.
- You are the most charming and beautiful woman I've met in a very long time.
No, G. What?
No, G And I'd be honored if you'd go out with me this evening, please.
Wonderful.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Goodbye.
- This evening was so special.
- It was perfect.
Chopin under the stars, candlelit dinner and then the carousel at the pier.
I can't remember when I've had such a good time.
I don't think I ever have.
It's nice to meet someone with similar interests within one's own station.
The last housekeeper I dated turned up in a T-shirt that said "Loose Booty".
Uh, speaking of being a housekeeper - I need to tell you something.
- And I need to tell you something.
I want to take you in my arms like a load of fresh laundry hot from the dryer.
Then what are you waiting for?
- Geoffrey.
- Sandford.
This is very awkward.
I'm surprised at you.
- Don't be too hard on her.
- I mean you, Geoffrey.
- Good evening, madam.
- Madam?
- But aren't you the housekeeper?
- Housekeeper?
This is Karen Caruthers, heiress to the Caruthers toilet tissue empire.
That's me, you know, please, don't squeeze the Caruthers.
I assure you.
Had I known, I wouldn't have.
Goodnight, madam.
- What are you watching?
- Love Story.
She dies.
Pardon my French, but ever since he stopped seeing Karen he's been one gloomy Gus.
Why did they stop seeing each other anyway?
Come on, Hilary, he'd be dating somebody with like a 1000 times more money than him.
What's your point?
I don't know.
See, Hilary, it's a man thing, you know.
It's like she'd be taking him to expensive places and buying him clothes and giving him all kind of gifts and paying for everything.
Damn, what is my point?
Lunch is served.
But it sucks.
I feel so sorry for Geoffrey.
I think we should all go to Spago.
That's nice.
We'll take Geoffrey to Spago.
Are you kidding?
He's our butler.
Wait a minute, come on.
We can't leave him all alone.
- The man's hurting.
- Will, trust me.
I've known him my entire life.
He's a rock.
Is that G or Blind Lemon Pledge?
Can't let this honey and her money do this to you, man.
It's much more complicated than that, Master William.
Master William have you ever had somebody come into your life and suddenly it's as if a door opens and everything goes from drab black and white to glorious color.
And then just as suddenly, she's gone.
The door slams in your face, and you're left standing alone in the dark.
That's how I feel without Karen.
Man, G. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
- Look.
G, look who's here.
- Drat.
- Tell her I don't want to talk to her.
- You got it.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.
G is dying to talk to you.
- Ain't you, G?
- Hi, Geoffrey.
I think I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry that I let you think I was working across the street instead of visiting.
But I was afraid if you knew I was worth $25,000,000 you wouldn't ask me out.
Look, the money makes no difference to G. Wait a minute, 25 mil?
I've to go to this party Saturday night for the Diamond League and I'd love for you to be my escort.
He accepts, he accepts.
Master William, I can speak for myself.
I accept.
Great, it's all set then.
G will pick you up around 8:00?
- Okay.
- Wait, you probably got a limo, though?
That's cool.
Like I said, he'll pick you up around 8:00.
Hey, hold it, can I get that limo?
Come on, Dad, it looks great.
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
How does it look?
Don't look directly at it, everybody'll notice.
Whatever you do, don't scratch.
I didn't bring any extra glue.
Hi, Aunt Viv.
Hey, you see G over there with his date?
It looks like everything's going Madam, please, this is quite improper.
- You must think of your station.
- I am.
Nothing's pulled into my station for quite a while.
Karen, isn't this a lovely party?
Oh, it certainly is.
Sarah, John, I'd like you to meet my date, Geoffrey.
- Delighted.
- Madam.
- Sir.
- Geoffrey, it's a pleasure.
- What business are you in?
- I'm a butler.
You may as well know that.
Of course I knew I recognized you.
Geoffrey Butler of the South Hampton Butlers.
I'm famished.
Canapé?
He is so considerate.
Put that tray down.
Geoffrey, I was just telling Sarah and John about your last trip to England.
- Did you stay at the Ritz-Carlton?
- No.
I stayed with my Uncle Neville and his common law wife, Ruby.
- Allow me, madam.
- Oh, Geoffrey.
What are you doing, Geoffrey?
Getting this water spot off your fork.
You're a guest here.
- You don't have to act that way.
- What way?
Heavens, look at these napkins.
They're all folded the wrong way.
You stop that.
You're embarrassing me.
I shall spare you any further embarrassment by joining the rest of the help.
Say, Mom, what was that really hip thing Dad said the other day?
My hip hurts?
No, I think it was "Yo, Vivian, I can't ride my Harley right now "I think it'll mess up my hair".
I knew there was something different.
Don't tell me.
The Executive, right?
The Sportsman.
You know I can water ski in this puppy.
Well, I feel ridiculous.
I don't need a rug to attract clients.
It's what's under the toupee that counts.
Come on, Vivian, we're leaving.
Carlton, you are grounded until you start losing your hair.
- G, what are you doing, man?
- Sweeping up some leaves.
But there ain't no leaves, G. You see leaves, I see leaves, man.
All right.
I was trying to catch a glimpse of Karen.
Why don't you just go over there and knock on the door, man?
- Impossible.
- Why, G?
Look it's obvious you crazy about her, man, and she's crazy about you.
What difference does it make if she's richer than a bus load of Japanese tourists?
It's not about money, Master William.
It's about class.
Class?
Who got more class than you?
You wear a tux to clean the toilet.
Master William I'm talking about the difference in people's stations in life.
I'm part of the working class.
Karen is not.
Okay, so, what if she was a housekeeper, right?
And she just hit the number for like 25 mil?
- And could you go out with her then?
- Certainly.
All right.
Now, what if she ain't have a dime to her name but she's the Queen of Zimbabwe.
- Could you take her out for a burger?
- It would be out of the question.
Okay.
Let's say that she was the daughter of an ambassador, right?
But the honey, like, moonlighted as a topless dancer.
Could you go out with her?
I don't know, Master William.
It isn't as if there's a list.
It's just the way things are done in England.
But we ain't in England.
I knew that.
Look, the point is It's a question of When it comes right down to it You're pretty much full of it, G. Rather seems so.
Thank you, Master William.
I think it's time for me to go squeeze the Caruthers.
I've come to apologize for last night.
You are within your rights never to speak to me again but I had to tell you how really special I think you are.
I should never have let something as foolish as $25,000,000 come between us.
I accept your apology.
Geoffrey, I really enjoy being with you.
You know, Karen, money doesn't matter.
We could have fun eating a snow cone walking down the beach.
Great.
I own a beach.
You bring the snow cones.
Take a break, Jeeves.
I think it's broken.
It's broken.
It's defective.

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
What's up, Will?
What happened to your Whitney Houston cutout?
She fell apart in the shower.
Me and Bill gonna kick it here a few days.
My building's being evacuated due to bubonic plague.
Jazz, you're about as welcome here as Mike Tyson at a beauty pageant.
Man, just throw us in the gutter.
Looks like rain.
You got any Scotchgard for Bill?
- Bill can stay.
- Forget that.
Where he goes, I go.
I mean, he's my role model.
Whenever I'm in a jam, I just ask myself: "What would Bill do in that situation"?
- And what does Bill suggest?
- Usually Pudding Pops.
Look, Jazz, I'm sure somebody else will take you in, man.
Nope.
Kuwaiti was my last hope.
And he suspects me of borrowing his whitewalls.
I did, but he ain't got no right to make that assumption.
Shoot, right now, I ain't even got a friend in Jesus.
All right, just hide your stuff in my closet and I'll work something out.
You won't even know we're here.
I will, however, require complete silence during The Young and the Restless.
Geoffrey, it sounds like you're getting a cold.
Not at all, madam.
It was barely a stipple.
There you go, Master William.
Thanks a lot, G. It looks great.
Yo, Carlton, breakfast!
That's it, Geoffrey.
As of now, you are off duty.
Now I want you to go up to your room and don't breathe until you get there.
As you bish, madam.
Hi, baby.
How was traffic court?
There is no justice.
Just because I had three moving violations and 48 parking tickets the judge suspended my driver's license.
Isn't free parking guaranteed by the Constitution?
Yeah, that's what Desert Storm was all about.
And starting tomorrow I have to do community service at the South Side Clinic.
I don't even know where that is.
Yeah, that's at the corner of Clemons and Third, right next to the nail shop.
Can't a brother get a pedicure?
Has anybody seen my bathrobe?
Will?
No, not me, Uncle Phil.
Hey, after the last time, I just bought a car cover.
Mom, I can't find my cassette player.
Does anybody know what happened to it?
Sure, blame the Black guy.
Mother, somebody took my address book.
I'd hate to think what might happen if it fell into the wrong hands.
Hola, amigos.
That's my cassette player.
- That's my bathrobe.
- That's my girlfriend.
- You're out of here, fella.
- Now, wait, Uncle Phil.
Now, picture this: A man, down on his luck Iost his woman, lost his job, lost his hope But enough about Marion Barry.
Can Jazz stay here?
Not a chance.
Jazz, what Mr. Banks means is that Geoffrey's not feeling well right now, and it's just not the best time for us to have houseguests.
Mr. Banks, I'll earn my keep.
I'll do whatever Geoffrey does.
Geoffrey bathes.
I can learn.
Look, I'll make you a deal, Uncle Phil.
All right Jazz will help out around the house and I'll clean up whatever messes he makes.
Please?
Come on, Jazz ain't got nowhere else to go.
No.
That's all right.
I understand.
If you need me, I'll be asleep under your car.
But just honk before you throw it in reverse.
All right, Jazz can stay.
All right, man.
I sleep naked with the window open.
I hope that don't bother you.
No, that's cool with me.
You're sleeping in Carlton's room.
Oh, my God, Will.
What?
What is it?
These people are all sick.
Get the heck out of here.
Mr. Clifford, we're ready to check your blood pressure.
That cute little tenderoni there got my pressure so high I'm about to blow a gasket.
I'm ready to go home now.
Leave.
Now.
- Hey there, Herman.
- No, it's Hilary.
But you can call me Herman if you want to.
Hi.
- Are you here from the court?
- Yes.
My name's Hilary Banks and my phone number is 555-9130.
Okay, I'd like you to start by helping patients fill out these intake forms.
I was hoping to work more closely with the doctor.
Do you have any medical experience?
Well, not exactly, but I've seen every single episode of St. Elsewhere.
Remember the episode where the handsome young doctor fell in love with the beautiful female volunteer?
- Yes.
- That's not gonna happen here.
The only thing that gets Dr. Hudson's attention is a medical problem.
Baby, what's wrong?
Did they wax the floor at Neiman's again?
- I twisted my ankle.
- Which ankle?
It's sort of a shooting pain.
It shoots from one ankle to the other.
Luckily, Dr. Handsome was there.
I mean, Hudson.
Dr. Alec Hudson, M.D. Hi, I'm Vivian Banks, Hilary's mom.
Thank you for marrying Carrying her.
Hi, I'm Ashley.
Do you come in a smaller size?
Nice to meet you.
Well, I'd better get going.
My ankle.
Unhand my woman's thigh.
It's my ankle.
Well, if you ever gave me any thigh, maybe I'd know the difference.
That's it, Jazz.
I've had it with you, man!
I'm about to thank you for starching my lucky drawers.
They're so clean and supportive.
Not only that, they're bulletproof.
Dr. Hudson, this is my nephew Will, and his friend Jazz.
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hi.
- Call me Alec.
- All right.
Malcolm's one of my heroes, too.
I idolize Malcolm.
He's the only reason I watch The Cosby Show.
That's weird.
Everyplace I've gone today, I've smelled garlic.
Hey, you didn't eat your lunch.
After I spent all morning frying the salami.
Uncle Phil, look what Hilary brought home.
He's a doctor, without a wedding band.
And, check it out, he's Black.
I wasn't always, but it was the only way I could get a scholarship.
- Alec Hudson, nice to meet you, sir.
- Philip Banks.
So, you're not married?
Have a seat, son.
Jazz, I told you not to touch my clothes!
And this label clearly says, "Hand wash".
And that's exactly what I did.
Before I stuck it in the machine, I washed my hands.
Well, time for dinner.
Jazz, sweetheart, you are a guest in our home.
Now, baby, why don't you sit down and never get up?
- Look, Jazz - I pull my own weight which is easier for some than others.
Look who's up.
It's Geoffrey.
Doesn't he look wonderful?
Actually, I spent the last half-hour regurgitating.
Thank God, 'cause I thought you were singing.
I'm a doctor.
May I?
This man is burning up.
Listen, I want you to go to bed, and you stay there.
I think we need a second opinion.
Come on, Geoffrey, I'll help you to your room.
I gotta go.
It was really nice meeting you all.
Hilary, I'll see you tomorrow?
No more pain.
How can I ever repay you?
I know.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
There ain't enough for him.
Well, I've got to hand it to you, son.
That cherries jubilee was some dish.
She sure was.
I'm sorry I lost her number.
I'm glad you liked it, sir.
If you'd had Grand Marnier, I would have made crepes suzettes.
I suppose everybody's too full to eat the Pop-Tarts I made for dessert.
Well, Alec, son, whenever you feel the urge to cook our kitchen's always open to you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go upstairs and relax.
Just like Black folk.
Eat, then they got to go to sleep.
Well, goodnight, Alec.
It's nice meeting you.
Don't screw this one up.
Better get going.
- What's your hurry?
- I gotta get up early tomorrow.
- Gotta go to the airport.
- I guess I'll see you tomorrow then.
- Peace, man.
- Peace.
Hilary, what's wrong?
He doesn't even know I'm alive.
If he don't know whether or not somebody's alive he's in the wrong damn business.
Jazz, didn't you promise Bill you'd make him some Jell-O?
If you want me to leave the room, just ask.
Most men find me attractive, but not Alec.
He didn't even look at me twice.
Hilary, Alec is not like most guys you date.
This dude is deep.
He's an intellectual.
He went to school for 10 years, after he graduated.
Maybe if I feathered my bangs.
Hilary, fancy hair and clothes are not gonna attract this guy.
I mean, that's the opposite of what he's looking for.
Yo, Will!
Yo, no!
Ah, salaam, I love you.
Hey, baby.
I'm Jazz, a close, personal friend of Bill Cosby.
Did I mention you're the only woman I ever loved?
Don't mention that to my fiancée, Hilary.
Jazz, that is Hilary.
If you gave me the attention I deserve I wouldn't have to fulfill my needs elsewhere.
Anybody seen my briefcase?
No.
Hilary, why in the world are you dressed like that?
I hope you don't think you're leaving the house looking like that.
But this is what will attract Alec.
I'll drop you off at the clinic.
Has anybody seen my briefcase?
Am I on trial here?
I mean, the minute something is missing they blame the help.
No one's blaming you, Jazz.
I'm glad we got that cleared up.
Will, might I see you in the kitchen a moment about a personal matter?
I think I know where your uncle's briefcase is.
It got a little condensed when I put it in that drawer.
That is not a drawer, Jazz, that's a trash compactor!
When Uncle Phil sees that it's gonna be a Jazz compactor!
That's gratitude for you.
I work all day trying to keep this house nice for you.
I cook, and clean, and work my fingers to the bone and this is the thanks I get?
Well, I bust my hump at school all day and you just sit around here watching soap operas and eating bonbons.
Well, excuse me for having a little fun.
Maybe it's because you never take me out anymore.
Maybe I would, if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
Hold up.
Wait a minute.
We sound like an old married couple.
So now I'm old?
And I gave you the best years of my life.
Look, I'm sorry.
All right.
Look, I'm sorry.
Come on.
Homeys?
Don't try and sweet-talk me.
And if you'll excuse me, I have a headache.
Yo!
Hilary.
I like your new rags.
Course you could be cross-eyed with a rash and still take my cash.
Slow down, Herman.
Have you been taking your medicine?
No, I have not, and I do not intend to.
Open up, Mr. Clifford.
I think it's time for my second dose.
Come back in six to eight hours.
I ain't got that much time left.
I'll be back in three.
I'm sorry I was late, Alec.
I came straight from court.
I was arrested during a free-Mandela rally.
Mandela was freed two years ago.
And I, for one, want to make sure he stays that way.
Say, why don't you come over for dinner again tonight and we can discuss how to keep the guy out of jail?
I'm sorry, Hilary, but I'm having a get-together tonight.
We're gonna discuss how to raise money for the clinic.
How fun!
A theme party.
Well, it starts at 7:00.
If you can get there, it'd be great.
You know, it is kind of short notice.
I might have to be a little late.
Is 7:01 okay?
So, Alec, it's amazing how many things we have in common.
Well, you have a beaded wall hanging I have beaded hair.
I think I'd better go before I lose an eye around here.
I'll just get out of your guys's way.
Excuse me.
Hi, Alec.
Hello.
- Hey, Alec.
- Hey, Lisa.
- How're you doing?
- Lisa, this is Hilary.
- Hilary, Lisa.
- Hi, how're you doing?
- Good, thanks.
- Lisa's the L.A. Chairperson for the National Board of Women.
I did a lot for the women's group at my college.
Really?
Were you a member?
Well, no.
But I did talk several of them into shaving under their arms.
Appearance has always been an important women's issue.
I think that when a woman shows too much of her body people don't notice her mind.
Well, that's a good point.
I agree.
But, on the other hand, if a woman feels comfortable showing her body she has the right to do so.
Because I know I feel comfortable looking.
And these days, fashion changes from one minute to the next.
Yeah, you know, definitely.
I see your point.
So look, why don't we just kick it over to Roscoe's Chicken N' Waffles?
No, I think I'd better stay.
We're trying to raise money for the clinic, and I work there.
- Really, what do you do?
- I'm a doctor.
Get the heck out of here, I'm one of them, too.
You look so young.
Yeah, well, down at the hospital, they refer to me as Brother Doogie.
You know, I think the whole idea of a woman's place being in the kitchen is absolutely absurd.
- How could anyone disagree with that?
- Well, not me.
Shall we move this conversation to a less oppressive room?
But on the other hand, if a woman enjoys cooking I find her very hard to resist.
Who's up for meatloaf?
As you know, Doctor, when you make the vertical incision from the thorax all the way down to the groin, you have to be careful not to hit an artery.
I mean, otherwise, you get excessive spurting.
But it really reminds you of why you became a doctor when you crack open that rib cage slip your hands in all the way up to your elbows and pull out that bloody, pulsating heart.
Would you care for some salsa?
I guess I was a little more tired than I thought.
Next time I donate an organ I'm just gonna let someone else perform the surgery.
Yeah, right.
I'll see you later, Doogie.
Hold up, baby.
Listen, Alec, if you're not busy Saturday night how would you like to go out for a nice little moonlight protest?
Your cause or mine.
- Well, actually, Hilary, I - Alec, hi.
Hey, Danielle.
- You like my new bangs?
- Yeah.
- I just got them feathered.
- Nice.
Hi, Danielle.
Alec, it's nice to meet your sister.
Danielle's not my sister.
- Cousin?
- We're not related.
Are you teaching her to read?
We're dating.
I see.
I guess you're not the man I thought you were.
And to think I actually touched a urine sample just to impress you.
And I lied.
I really did think Eldridge Cleaver was a big chopping knife.
So there.
Hilary S. Banks has just jumped through her last hoop.
Really nice purse.
I've never been so humiliated in my life.
Come on, Hilary, now that's not true.
Now, what about the time that you showed up at Spago with the back of your dress tucked down inside your pantyhose?
Okay, that was a bad example.
But look, all I'm saying is I mean, you've survived worse.
Jazz!
I made a complete fool of myself.
I couldn't agree more.
I mean, we've been beating around the bush much too long.
Mr. Banks, I'm willing to take Hilary off your hands.
Jazz, would you prefer a Muslim or a Viking burial?
I mean, she ain't getting any younger.
I'll put a roof over her head.
I might be willing to look into a marriage license if she performs on the test drive.
Philip, get him.
What'd I do?
I liked that one.

- Geoffrey.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, all.
Good morning.
Well, here they are.
Hot off the presses.
Move over, Kitty Kelly.
Cedric has arrived.
"Through the Keyhole: Memoirs of an Embittered Butler.
" Check this out.
Is it Cedric, or is it Patrick Swayze?
Excuse me, but writing a sordid, steamy, exposé about the Randolph family is darned offensive, and we won't have anything to do with that smut.
Oh, get real.
May I recommend Chapter 7?
Mr. And Mrs. Randolph found it particularly humiliating.
- Geoffrey, this book is dedicated to you.
- But of course.
It was Geoffrey who gave me the idea in the first place.
By the way, how are your memoirs coming along, old boy?
Allow me to see you out, Aunt Blabby.
Will, go to school.
Aunt Viv, I need a nighttime sniffling, sneezing fallen and I can't get up medicine.
Will, you are burning up.
Philip, he really is sick.
Baby, is it your throat again?
Vivian, don't let that boy con you.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Now, you know what the doctor said.
One more throat infection and those tonsils have just got to come out.
I'm all better.
It's a miracle.
I got no more fever I got no more fever Aunt Viv?
- Yes?
- Catch me.
Hello.
I'm Vivian Banks.
I believe my nephew, Will Smith - has been assigned to this room.
- Smith?
Oh, yes.
Tonsillectomy, tomorrow morning.
All righty.
And where is our brave little soldier?
I keep telling you, I ain't sick.
I'm not sick.
Sweetheart, now you know what Dr. Bennett said.
Those tonsils have just got to come out.
- Now there's no reason to be afraid.
- Who are you kidding?
Why do you think they wear masks?
So they can't be identified.
And why do you think they knock you out?
So you don't see them drinking margaritas over your open stomach.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop by the gift shop.
Hey, thanks a lot, Hil, that's real nice.
Well, sometimes a girl just has to treat herself.
Your overnight case, Master Will.
I've packed everything but your pajamas.
Where do you keep them?
- Well, I usually keep them inside the - Don't answer that.
It'll be in Geoffrey's memoirs and Urkel will play you in the TV movie.
I'll just wait in the car.
Will, this might be a good time for you to put your John Hancock on this.
"I, Will Smith, being of sound mind, do hereby bequeath" - Yo, what the hell is this?
- It's your peace of mind, my friend.
Let's say you die.
Do you want just anyone to get their hands on that $323 and 15 cents you have hidden under your LL Cool J hat?
I ain't think about it like that.
Can I see that, Carlton?
Sure, Will.
I hate to break up this Hallmark moment, but visiting hours are over.
Okay.
Well, you better get some rest, we better get going.
No, Aunt Viv, no!
Please can't you just stay one more itty bitty teenie weenie moment?
Don't leave me here, Aunt Viv.
Two bottles of beer on the wall Two bottles of beer If one of them bottles should happen to fall How many bottles of beer on the wall?
One bottle of beer on the wall One bottle of beer I'm afraid you really have to go now.
Yo, can we finish our song, please?
One million bottles of beer on the wall One million bottles of beer Zowie.
It's showtime at the Apollo.
You don't get out much, do you?
Dinner time.
Look like somebody already ate this.
Faster, faster, faster.
Come on, faster.
- Max.
- Yeah.
Running around like this could be fatal.
So, you'll die and I'll get another nurse.
Nurse, nurse darling?
I dropped my lucky hat.
Would you please pick it up for me?
Thank you very much.
Beautiful.
I never forget a face.
Max?
Why do you call this your lucky hat?
No reason.
Hey.
Hi, kid.
Guess you're my new roommate, huh?
Well, good.
Man, when I get old I hope I get as much action as you.
Heck, next week I hope I get as much action as you.
- Will Smith, tonsils.
- Max Jakey, everything else.
Sweaty palms, kid.
First timer?
Man, you must be tripping.
I was 15 when I first - You mean surgery.
- Yes.
Relax.
As long as you got a good doctor, kid, what could go wrong?
And now you'll have to excuse me.
I'm gonna cop a sponge bath.
- Max, you're supposed to be in therapy.
- I played there 40 years ago.
Bad theater, lousy audience.
- Will Smith?
- Yeah.
- I'll be performing your surgery.
- Whoa.
No, you won't, man.
I want my regular doctor.
When can I see Dr. Bennett?
In five-to-10 years.
Oh, come on, relax.
I'm Dr. Baylor and I'm eminently qualified to perform this operation.
Where are my glasses?
Oh, hell.
Nurse, did they close up Miss Henderson yet?
Never mind.
But check my locker for my beeper, will you?
All right, Mr. Smith, open your mouth.
- Yo, my man, your beeper ain't in here.
- Oh, come on, let me look at those tonsils.
Well, so much for golf tomorrow.
Hey, Doc, y'all just gonna take the tonsils, right?
Hey, I got big plans for everything else.
Trust me.
You're in the hands of a capable doctor.
I've got to find those glasses.
God please don't let me leave here with breasts.
Max!
- Yeah, what?
- What do you think of the rap tape?
Rap tape?
Sounded like an auction.
- Kreplach?
- Yo, man, what'd you call me?
Kreplach.
It's a dumpling.
Hey, have a nosh.
- Yo.
Hey, Max?
- Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
You all cooped up in this hospital.
Why are you so happy about it?
Look, kid, I'm 83 years old.
Inside I feel like I'm just as young as you.
The difference is, you think you're immortal.
Me, I know better.
I don't have to waste time feeling sorry for myself.
You know what I mean?
You know, you're really something, Max.
Please, don't make me cry.
I can't spare the fluid.
- Do me a favor, will you?
Turn on the TV.
- Oh, sure.
Give me this.
So what do you wanna watch, Max?
Man, I had forgotten how big Jimmie Walker's lips was.
Max?
Goodnight, Max.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Peterson, we did the best we could.
But, Doctor, I don't understand.
We just brought little Billy to the hospital for a field trip.
And now he's Doctors play God, and patients get the short end of the scalpel on the next Oprah Winfrey Show.
Why aren't we sleeping, Mr. Smith?
'Cause we in here bugging out, Nurse Petty.
Sounds like a job for Mr. Needle.
Sorry, I must got the wrong number.
Yo, Will Smith, man, my main patient.
What's up, homey?
- Doctor Dré?
- Yo, man, what's happening, man?
Yo, this next LP, man, has got your name written all over it.
All over it, homey.
- You know what it's called?
- No.
Yo man, it's called Death Certificate, man.
Yo, man, are you ready for some dope cuts?
No!
Confounded!
Everywhere I go, I hear the same damn music.
- That'll be all now, Nurse.
- Whoa, wait a minute, man - you ain't no doctor.
- No, but I play one on TV.
Yeah, you that dude from the soap opera.
- Hey, didn't you just die in a car crash?
- Oh, no.
Right now I'm hanging precariously on the edge of a cliff and I intend to stay there until they put a window in my dressing room.
Now, let's get busy with that brain transplant, shall we?
Whoa, man.
I'm just getting my tonsils out.
Tonsils don't get ratings, young man.
One of us will be right back, right after this commercial.
Gloves.
Gauze.
Scalpel.
Yo, man, you better be using that scalpel to cut some lemon wedges for Isaac.
Come on, buddy, I don't have all day.
In 15 minutes, I gotta meet Adrienne Barbeau on the poop deck.
Hey, man, I don't care if you're playing shuffleboard with Nipsey Russell.
I ain't getting cut by no doctor with knee socks.
Look, there's nothing to worry about.
I've pretended to do this operation a thousand times.
Look, this time they've given me a real scalpel.
Cool.
Man, I'm getting out of here before Dr. Hannibal Lecter shows up.
Doctor, the patient in 214 is not responding to the medication.
What should I do?
Well, Nurse, I'd run a KGB and an NAACP.
If he still doesn't respond give him an upper GI Joe.
I've got to get my real estate license.
They got some free ice-cream and cake in the cafeteria.
Well, this is enjoyable.
It's been too long since we've spent quality time together.
Daddy's right.
Can I go now?
Oh, come on.
We're a family.
We should express our feelings.
Dad, let's cut the crapola and get to what's really on our minds.
Oh, sweetheart, Will's operation's gonna go fine.
Yeah.
I'm talking about Geoffrey's book.
Geoffrey can write whatever he wants.
This family has nothing to hide.
Your father's right.
Now I don't want to hear any more about it, okay?
Philip, would you help me clear the dishes, please?
Geoffrey knows everything about us.
If Mom and Dad find out what really goes on around here, they're going to kill us.
We've got to get that book.
The Butler's Tales, Chapter 42.
Someone get that damn door!
Oh, that would be me.
All right, all right.
I hate this part of the job.
It's never for me.
Those memoirs have got to be in here somewhere.
Okay, Ashley, we're in.
Now hit the dirt and start twitching.
Carlton, we've got to find those memoirs.
I'll just die if my friends find out why Lou in Better Shoes gives me that 10% discount.
Yeah, what if my friends find out I sleep with a hand puppet?
Move over, Carlton.
I don't have any room.
Will, move over.
Will?
Geoffrey, we'd like to speak to you for a moment.
- He's not here, Philip, let's go.
- Not so quick, Vivian.
Do you really want Hilary to find out she was conceived during a Sly Stone concert?
Well, it never would have happened if he hadn't been five hours late.
All right, everybody out.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
What are y'all doing here?
And I hope them concert tickets wasn't front row.
Is that why you always play Hot Fun in the Summertime on my birthday?
- Where was I conceived?
- Probably at a white sale.
That's enough.
Will, why aren't you in the hospital?
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
I'm scared of going under the knife.
I mean, if I wanted to get cut I'd let Stevie Wonder do my fade.
Sweetheart, I know you're nervous about this operation but you have to believe that we know what's best for you.
The bottom line is it has to be done.
So you have a choice.
You can either be dragged in kicking and screaming or you can stand up and walk in like a man.
Now, Will, we're gonna step outside and talk to your doctor.
You've given us your word that you won't try to escape, and I trust you.
Abdulla, here's $100.
If he tries to run, sit on him.
Okay, we'll be right back, sweetheart.
Hey, so, where's Max at?
Out playing doctor with a couple nurses?
No, I'm afraid Max has gone to a better place.
- What?
Gone?
- Yeah, he went.
Just like that.
Wait, hold it.
That's his lucky hat.
Here I am acting like a little baby over a couple of tonsils.
Max had all that stuff wrong with him.
Never even complained.
So long, Max.
Hi, Will, how do you feel?
Like I swallowed a weed whacker.
Oh, hello there, Master Will.
I've brought you something to read.
- What is it, G?
- My memoirs.
- Give me that.
- Let me have it.
Mom, you scratched me.
I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.
I've just come back from my literary agent and the memoirs have been rejected.
Hey, I'm sorry, G. What'd your agent say?
I believe he referred to it as "Sominex in a dust jacket".
Hi, kid.
Max.
I thought you died.
In Pittsburgh I died.
It wasn't my fault.
I was opening for a seal.
Wait.
The nurse said you went on to a better place.
I did.
Cedars-Sinai Hospital.
They've got cable.
Actually, I just came back to get my lucky hat.
I'm glad you're okay, kid.
You know, maybe we could hang out sometime.
Maybe.
If you were a woman and I had a prostate.
See you around, kid.
Wait, Max, you're forgetting your lucky hat.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
I forgot the hat.
Tell you what, kid you keep it.
Oh, Nurse?
Kreplach.
It's a dumpling.
I got kugel here.
Tsimmes, latkes.
Jewish Why are you so happy about it?
Look, kid, I'm 83 years old.
And I chewing on the What you got to go through for a lousy $100,000 a show.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hey, Uncle Phil.
I think Aunt Viv put the Ring Dings in the cabinet over here.
The sink is busted, and I'm trying to fix it, Will.
Wait, Uncle Phil, no.
Geoffrey's eyebrows just grew back from the time you tried to fix the stove, man.
Philip, drop the wrench and step away from the sink.
Why does everybody act like I'm dangerous when I'm trying to fix something?
Have you forgotten the toaster incident, sweetie?
Geoffrey hasn't.
How was I supposed to know a piece of whole wheat would scratch a man's cornea?
Besides, I know plumbing.
Certainly got the pants for it.
- I'm calling the plumber.
- I'm calling the tailor.
Hello?
Philip, did you do something to the phone?
There was a little static on the line, so I did a little rewiring.
Honey, there's no dial tone.
There's no static, either.
Here's the keys to your car, Aunt Viv.
Thanks for letting me use it.
You're welcome, baby.
When are you gonna get your car fixed?
I don't have to.
I'm gonna win a brand-new Corvette on this game show.
Yeah, right.
Right after your Uncle Philip repairs something that doesn't send Geoffrey to the emergency room.
No, seriously, Aunt Viv.
They were recruiting down at the mall.
I'm gonna be on the game show, Double Trouble.
- You're gonna be on TV?
- Yeah.
Well, that is so exciting.
All right!
All right.
Aunt Viv, I'll push and if you Spackle real fast, we could probably wall him in.
Well, I just called the repairman from the car phone.
They can't come out until tomorrow.
No phone service for 24 hours?
This is a nightmare.
I mean, it's like we've vanished off the face of the earth!
Don't be so dramatic, Hilary.
Hey, she's not being dramatic.
Jimmie Walker's phone went out for 24 hours in the late 70s and, hey, well, y'all know the rest.
The phones are still out.
Excuse my language, Dad, but it's got to be said I'm behind you, big guy.
Mom, Cathy's line is busy.
Can I have the keys so I can drive the phone over to her house?
Sure, honey, in four years.
I'm sure the phone will still be broken.
Yeah, that reminds me.
When I win that brand-new Corvette, I'm gonna have a phone on the dash leather on the seats, and Halle Berry on my lap.
I can't believe you're gonna be on Double Trouble.
Double Trouble?
Are you nuts?
You want to embarrass yourself in front of the entire country for a lifetime supply of Alberto VO5?
What you talking about, man?
It ain't embarrassing.
All I gotta do is answer a couple questions and let my partner squirt some stuff all over me.
Wasn't Jimmy Swaggart just arrested for that?
So, who's gonna be your partner?
Oh, Kellogg Leiberbaum.
He's the smartest dude in school.
He's gonna call me on the car phone at 8:00.
That is, if Uncle Phil don't try to fix it.
Well, that's it.
The next person that mentions the phone, gets a boot in their behind.
Mr. Banks, your phone is broken.
It occurs to me, this family's got a lot to learn about hospitality.
Hey, what's up, J?
I'm here to practice for the game show.
Wait a minute, how do you know I'm going on a game show?
From Willy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' Waffles.
He knows everything.
He's the source that revealed that Mariah Carey's black.
- Jazz, hold up a second, man.
- Yo, Will.
- Yo, what's up, Ty?
- Bro.
- What's he doing here?
- No, what's he doing here?
Well, come, now y'all not still mad at each other about the watch thing?
- Yo, he sold me a fake Rolex.
- You paid with a fake 20.
All right, now first of all, you should have known that it was fake when you saw that the warranty was only for two hours.
And you should have known that the Jackson on a 20 ain't Jermaine.
They all look alike to me.
Be that as it may, when do we start practicing for the game show?
- I'm his partner.
- I'm his partner.
What, wait, how does everybody know I'm going on a game show?
Man, from Willy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' Waffles.
I'm telling He knows everything.
He's the source who revealed Color Me Badd was white.
Look, so is it gonna be me or him?
- I already got a partner.
- Who?
Kellogg Leiberbaum.
He's a dude from my school.
My bro, if you did have to pick one of us.
Speaking hypodermically.
I don't have to, so I'm not gonna choose.
All right?
Okay, you know, because I'm your best friend I respect your decision.
Because I am your best friend.
Peace, my best friend.
Some best friend.
When you go to your car, you gotta walk.
- What?
Don't you?
- Please, watch this.
Yo, Mr. Banks, my tubby judicial brother.
Man, there ain't no water pressure.
Somebody in this house broke the three-minute shower limit.
Obviously, it wasn't you.
Would you mind standing downwind?
My fault, G. I guess I got a, kind of, Pepé Le Pew thing going here.
Morning.
Aunt Viv, can you please tell Uncle Phil to call the plumber?
There's gotta be something you can do, or not do.
- Geoffrey, can I get some coffee, please?
- I'm working on it, madam.
Well, when will it be ready?
At this rate?
About the time Queen Elizabeth opens for Queen Latifah.
Mother, why can't Daddy be like other lawyers and hire people and then sue them for inferior work?
I mean, look at my hair.
It hasn't been washed in 24 hours.
I can't possibly go to work looking like this.
Man, you sure can't.
You should probably call in ugly.
Will, I hate to rain on your fashion parade but the Moms Mabley look is definitely passé.
I was trying to take a shower, but there ain't no water pressure 'cause somebody broke the three-minute shower limit.
- What?
- Don't give me that.
Look at these fingernails.
Look behind these ears.
How long did you bathe today, young lady?
Seven minutes.
I'm sorry, but I had to wash.
I have enough problems.
I'm going through puberty for God's sake.
Good morning, everyone.
Hey, Aunt Viv, I'm telling you, if we band together we can take him.
Leave him alone, honey, he's mine.
Philip, baby if Mr. Goodwrench wants to visit Mrs. Toolbox he'd better get Mr. Water running.
Carlton, get the yellow pages.
And now it's time for America's messiest, winningest program Double Trouble!
- My brother.
- Yo, what's up, J?
I see you're watching Double Trouble a show both salubrious and sudorific.
For you, in recognition of our salubrious and sudorific friendship.
You got a little salube on the side of your lip, too.
What's this?
That's me.
Yo, Will.
- Hey, what's up, Ty?
- Nice weather we're having.
Guess that's 'cause we're the third planet from the sun.
Unlike Mercury, where the surface is perpetually molten.
For you.
I appreciate the gifts, fellas, but, you know I think I still want to see other people.
Look, a little nasty piece of carpet with a vest.
Will, this is Winky.
Winky, Will.
Where'd you get a stupid name like Winky?
Man, Winky was my father's name.
Will, could you tell this sucker to take his sack of lint and beat it?
Me and you gotta practice for the game show.
Look, Will needs a partner who knows his trivia and no one's more trivial than me.
Yeah, what Will needs is intellectual capacitance.
All right.
Look, I already told you.
Leiberbaum is my partner.
- Master William?
- Yo, what's up, G?
Young Leiberbaum stopped by on his way to the airport.
- What?
Where's he going?
- He wouldn't say.
It appears he's been getting notes warning him to get out of town.
Come on, how y'all gonna play Leiberbaum?
Man, this is just a stupid game show.
There's more at stake here than a stupid game show, my brother.
That's right, our friendship's on the line.
Come on, pick your best friend.
Yeah, go ahead, Will, tell him.
Who's gonna be your partner?
All right, I pick I pick Carlton.
Carlton is your partner?
Yeah, what he got I ain't got?
On a straight up tip, y'all, see, Carlton got this rare disease, right?
And to go on this game show was his last desperate wish before he takes that old dirt nap.
That's decent, Will.
What he got?
He got Bette Davis eyes.
Will, can I borrow your Walkman?
I'm going out for a five-mile run.
- Yo, this don't sound right.
- And you call yourself a friend.
All right, so I lied.
But, come on, y'all, I wanna win that car!
I mean, and to win on these game shows you gotta be you know, Carlton-like.
- I don't get it.
- His point exactly.
You see, what Will is trying to say is and let me choose my words carefully you guys are stupid.
Look, that is not what I'm trying to say.
Look, it's like this, y'all.
It's like, with Carlton Carlton, who is Captain Kangaroo's friend?
Mr. Green Jeans.
- How many players on a cricket team?
- Eleven.
- Letters not on a phone dial?
- Q and Z. - Best picture, 1936?
- The Great Ziegfeld.
- The third wife of Julius Caesar?
- Calpurnia.
You see?
Yeah, I see.
You think we're stupid.
Well, I guess I better be going but I guess I'm too stupid to find the door.
That's right.
I guess if we put our brains together we could find our way out.
And by the way, can you remind me when to breathe?
What just happened here, man?
I sacrificed my two best friends for a stupid convertible.
Yeah, well.
The wind in my face will dry my tears.
- Good luck.
- Wait, hold up.
- You ain't gonna help me out?
- Certainly not.
You have little to lose from public humiliation.
I, on the other hand, have a future.
In eight years, I graduate from Harvard Law and begin clerkship with Clarence Thomas.
Only someone with the highest dignity will be considered.
Yeah, or a real tight butt.
Either way, I'm in pretty good shape.
So, Carlton, what?
You want me to beg?
Is that it?
I'm not sure.
Try and we'll see.
Okay.
I beg you to remember last Saturday night when you got home around 10:00 and your drawers ain't get here till the next morning.
Let the games begin.
In five, four, three, two.
Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Eubanks!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hello, everybody.
Thank you.
And welcome back to another edition of Double Trouble!
All right, let's jump right into it and meet our first team.
This guy likes music, basketball, and girls, and not necessarily in that order.
He's a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Welcome Will Smith!
Will's partner is Bel-Air, California, born and bred.
He's a fan of Tom Jones mutual funds, and capital punishment.
Say hello to Carlton Banks.
Will and Carlton, nice to have you with us.
Okay, let's meet their opponents now.
This fellow says he's into frozen pizza, Laverne & Shirley reruns and I want you to meet LA's oldest 10th grader his name is Tyriq Johnson!
Tyriq's partner is a brain surgeon who still finds time to date the salubrious Whitney Houston.
Let's have a warm Double Trouble welcome for Dr. Jazzy Jeff M.D., Ph.
D., and O.P.P. What the hell are they doing here?
And how long has he been dating Whitney Houston?
Okay, here's how we play Double Trouble.
Contestants win points for answering trivia questions.
Now, at the end of the question round the contestants compete in a physical stunt.
Hey, and audience, what kind of stunts do we have here on Double Trouble?
Stupid!
That's right, so sit tight.
We'll be right back in just a moment with our first round.
And we're clear.
Hey, fellas, it worked out perfect, right?
We all got to be on the show!
Have we met?
Or am I too stupid to remember?
Jazz, I think that's that backstabbing Smith boy.
Time to breathe again.
It's like that?
Well, look, at least one of us will win the car and when I do, you guys can grab a bus and meet me at the beach.
Come on.
Places.
Three, two.
Okay, it's time for the trivia round and here's our first question.
Everybody ready?
Here we go.
"What famous cartoon character "soared to fame on his oversized ears"?
- Carlton.
- That's an easy one, Bob.
The beloved pachyderm in question won our young hearts by turning a handicap into I'm sorry.
Time is up.
Let's go to your opponents.
Answer, dumbo.
Dumbo's the correct answer.
You got that for 100 points.
Okay, here we go again.
Hands on your buzzers.
Next question, tell me: "What is the capital of Ohio"?
- Tyriq?
- That would be the capital "O," Bob.
"O"?
Yeah, that's right, Bob, Ohio.
You know, capital "O," little "h" Do I have to spell the whole thing?
I guess I didn't say "capital city".
I'll have to get a ruling from our judges.
Judges, what do you say?
Sounds like the judges are accepting that answer.
Sounds like the judges drank their lunch.
Okay, Tyriq and Jazz, you're well out in front, you've got 200 points.
It's time now for our final question of the round, and here it is.
"'The rain in Spain stays mainly,' where"?
Carlton.
Actually, Bob, the rainfall in the Pyrenees Mountains of Spain - falls at a whopping - "In the plains," Bob!
"In the plains".
Yes, that's right.
You got it for 100 points.
Okay, that concludes our question round.
I want you to sit tight and find out what kind of a fine mess these folks have gotten themselves into when we come back for our stunt round on Double Trouble.
We'll be right back for that.
And welcome back.
Well, we've cooked up a real doozy this time, folks.
So let's get our contestants out here right now.
Come on, guys.
Okay, contestants, now you know what you have to do.
You have a minute-and-a-half to do it.
So I want you to get on your bicycles and act stupid.
Now it's time for the final round of Double Trouble and let's find out just how well our contestants know their partners.
And here's how it works.
While Will and Jazz are in the soundproof booth we're gonna ask their partners a question about them.
So, Will and Jazz, if you would please take your places in our soundproof booth.
Wait.
That joint ain't gonna fill up with water or nothing, Bob, is it?
Not this week.
Go ahead.
All right now, Carlton and Tyriq, here's your question.
If your partner could name only one person as his best friend who would that special person be?
Now you have until the buzzer sounds to think about it.
Time is up.
All right, Carlton, let's hear your answer.
Well, Bob, let's back it up for a moment and define this thing called friendship.
You see, the ancient Mayans Carlton, your time is up.
Okay, Tyriq who is Jazz's best friend?
I'm sorry, Bob, this is a bad time.
All I gotta do is answer a couple questions and let my partner squirt some stuff at me.
Sorry.
I guess you're reading something really good.
Wasn't Jim Swaggart Wasn't Jimmy Swaggart arrested for that?
Great line reading.
I tried.
What?
No.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just let me Okay, I'm fine.

{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Come on, Uncle Phil.
Vogue.
Express yourself Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
Will, sweetie, you've been snapping everything in sight for days.
Now, what's going on?
It's a photography assignment, Aunt Viv.
I wanted to do something meaningful and artistic but ain't nobody getting naked.
Morning, all.
Carlton, the photography assignment is due today.
You haven't snapped a single picture yet.
Not to worry.
Carlton, this is a photography assignment.
Not a Prince video.
Madam, sir, there is a most perturbing person out here who claims to be an old friend of yours.
- Who is it, Geoffrey?
- She didn't say.
She was too busy calling me a pathetic servant of the capitalist fat cats.
- Marge.
- Marge.
You look so good, girl, give me a hug!
Look at you.
Woman, the last time I saw you was that anti-war rally in '71.
You stole my Afro comb.
Don't look like you be needing it now.
- Hi, I'm Carlton.
- Hi, Carlton.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Will.
My God, you look just like my old boyfriend, EI.
I take it El was blindingly handsome.
- Who's EI?
- Eldridge Cleaver.
Was he related to Wally and the Beav?
Hold it.
- You knew Eldridge Cleaver?
- We were all in the movement together.
Me, EI, Olifami, and Adisimbol.
Wait, hold up.
Olifami and Adisimbol, too?
Man, that's unbelievable.
Who the hell are they?
Phil is Olifami and Vivian is Adisimbol.
Okay, and I'm "About To Bust A Gut-a".
Boy, you two have come a long way from that fifth floor walk-up you had when Olifami and I were in law school.
Boy, those were the days.
We marched on Washington, staged sit-ins, held hunger strikes.
Would that have been between breakfast and lunch, or lunch and dinner?
But we knew how to par-tay, too.
Did we ever.
Remember Woodstock?
- Yes.
- 20 of us tried to squeeze into that tent.
Vivian and I jumped into that lake naked.
I wasn't at Woodstock.
Yeah.
Kids, did I tell you that Marge and I went to school together?
That she graduated near the top of our law school class?
So, Marge, are you with a firm or on your own?
On my own.
I'm still in the struggle.
That's dope, Marge.
You never gave up on what you believed in.
I do my best.
Hey, check it out.
Look right into the camera and say "Burn, baby, burn".
No, you can't take my picture.
I mean, just wait for me to freshen up a little.
But speaking of pictures, look at what I have here.
- Oh, no.
- Come on.
- Look at this.
- Oh, my God.
Who are those two weirdoes and who is that ugly little kid in the dashiki diaper?
Those two weirdoes are your father and I, and that ugly little kid is you.
The bone in your hair is a good look for you, Hilary.
Yeah, you've got sort of a "yabba-dabba do".
Mom, look at how short your skirt is.
Your mother's legs made the miniskirt famous.
I have Mom's legs.
Can I wear my skirt that short?
You have my legs, and the answer is no.
Marge, girl, you must be tired after your trip.
Now, you're staying with us.
And I don't want to hear any arguments.
You aren't getting any.
Just tell me where to plug in my eight-track.
Geoffrey will take your bags up to the guest room.
I carry my own bag.
My brother, you have been oppressed, repressed, and suppressed by capitalism.
Don't you know you can be free?
I have known freedom, don't like the health plan.
Geoffrey is not oppressed.
He's more our friend.
Aren't you, Geoff?
Whatever you say, Phil.
So you can see how Ansel Adams created a work of genius just by using light and shadow.
Which brings me to your work, geniuses.
All right.
Let's see those homework assignments.
I like that.
Will, that wouldn't happen to be gum in your mouth, would it?
- Yes, Mr. Knotts.
- Cool, do you have any more?
Thanks.
That's good.
Carlton, this is It's a very, it's What the hell is it?
Our assignment, sir.
You asked us to experiment with shadow.
I call this Bunny on a Wall.
And I'm gonna call this Midget at a Desk.
Everybody, before you go, there's something I'd like you to remember.
I think that there is something very special about every single one of you.
- Class dismissed.
- Wait, hold up.
What about our trip to the Mapplethorpe exhibit?
Don't you want our permission slips?
Mine ain't forged this time.
Hey, come on, Cornflake, where's your permission slip?
Are you kidding?
My parents won't let me look at naked photos.
They thought The Little Mermaid was pornographic.
Turned me on.
I can't go see the Mapplethorpe exhibit either.
Actually, none of us is going.
It seems that a lot of your parents just don't approve of this exhibit and since going was my bright idea - I've been fired.
- What?
No.
What?
Hold up, they can't do that.
This is an outrage!
They can't give us a new teacher now.
I mean, I've spent the whole semester sucking up to you.
- Hey, Marge.
- Hey.
I still can't believe they fired the best teacher that Bel-Air Prep ever had.
You know, you been talking about this for the past two days.
Move on it.
You know what Malcolm said: "By any means necessary".
Yeah, you know, Marge, you're right.
I'm gonna move on it.
Good.
I like having you around.
You get me all hyped and everything.
I bet that's how you felt when you roomed with Angela Davis, right?
Yeah.
But we had a lot of huge arguments.
Word?
What?
About her political views?
No, about how she used to always put her name on everything in the refrigerator.
Got on my nerves.
Yeah, and I bet with that big old Afro, she probably had a lot of hair and Afro Sheen and stuff all over the place, right?
Boy, don't get me started.
You know what?
I'm gonna call you Hasani.
What, you just gonna dis me right in my face like that, Marge?
No, it's Swahili.
It means "handsome".
I like how you talk, Marge.
I like how you think, too.
Hey, you know what?
I got a name for you, too.
It's just "Too Legit To Quit".
Hey, that's pretty clever.
Did you just think of that?
Yeah, why?
You like it?
Your Perrier, my sister.
Hey, Marge, listen.
We just got tickets to the Roberta Flack concert tonight.
Come on, we'll grab a bite to eat first.
No, I don't feel like going out tonight.
Come on, you haven't been anyplace since you've been here.
No.
I mean, we'll make it another time, okay?
Greetings, Sister Adisimbol.
Greetings, Brother Olifami.
Power to the people!
Ash, you kind of look like Winnie the Pooh Mandela.
Mom, Daddy, I am a depressed minority and I want my allowance increased.
No.
Then I'm staging a sit-in and I won't eat my peas.
You will eat your peas.
Come on, Daddy.
Suppose Gandhi's parents treated him like this.
Gandhi ate his peas.
Then I shall spray paint my demands on the pool house wall.
- We like to encourage free speech.
- We certainly do.
Ashley!
Girl, are you crazy?
Get your butt back here!
You're on the mike, what's your beef?
No, sir, he just stepped out.
Yeah.
Sure, I'll tell him.
All right.
That was the FBI looking for Uncle Phil.
I wonder what they want.
They want me.
Look I guess I better just flat out say this.
- The FBI wants me.
- What?
- The FBI?
- Really?
Could you put in a good word for me?
I'm thinking of applying.
She means they're after her, Carlton.
- She's a fugitive.
- We're harboring a fugitive?
Look, no offense, Marge, but I'm not going to prison over this.
No way am I sharing a cell with a woman called Big Mama.
Marge, I don't understand.
What do they want you for?
Take your pick.
I helped a bunch of migrant workers bust out of an internment camp broke into some federal buildings, shredded a few files made life pretty damn difficult for the South African Embassy back East.
Man, and I thought I was doing my part by going to Spike Lee movies.
Does the government know where you are?
They probably know I'm in the area and they're checking out everybody I know.
No, it's cool, Marge.
We're gonna stand right behind you.
Right?
Marge, you know we love you, but we've got a family to think about.
Why don't you give us some time to think this over?
I understand.
Marge.
We're behind you 200%.
Peace.
- Operator, get me the FBI.
- Carlton, what are you doing, man?
Come on, Will.
We're harboring a fugitive.
- She's not a fugitive, she's our friend.
- Yeah.
And ever since she got here my diary has been a lot more interesting.
Well, I agree, Ashley's diary is a lot more interesting.
- But it's not worth going to jail over.
- Okay, that is enough, Carlton.
Your mother and I will handle this.
I hate to sound paranoid but do we really know if Mom and Dad are who they say they are?
Or if their names are really Mom and Dad?
Gentlemen, we all agree that Mr. Knotts' dismissal is wrong but we have the rights to redress our grievances which is why I urge you to sign this petition.
Sometimes a man has to be willing to put his name on the line for what he believes in.
"Ricky Ricardo"?
"Lucy, you got some explaining to do".
Hey, look, fellas.
There ain't no point in trying to reason with The Man when The Man is not trying to reason with you.
Right on.
What we gotta do is get up in his grill - and show him that we got the power.
- Yes!
Power to the people.
Say it loud.
I'm Black and I'm proud!
All right.
My man Cornflake got the spirit.
He's a little confused, but he's got the spirit.
Hey, look, what we got to do is take over this classroom.
We gotta nail that door shut, and we gotta chain ourselves together to show them that we mean business, each and every one of us.
Now y'all with me?
Will, I think I speak for all of us when I say let's get the hell out of here.
Don't worry, Will.
They'll never take us alive.
Hey, calm down, man.
I already bought my suit for the prom.
Hey, look, what we gotta do is nail that door shut.
- I'll call the handyman.
- Come on, man, we're radicals.
- We gotta do things for ourself.
- You're right, my brother.
Where are the safety goggles?
Man, my butler forgot to pack them.
Here, here you go.
Here, man, it's easy.
It's like this.
- Yo, you all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm just hyperventilating.
This is so exciting.
We're like The Mod Squad, without Julie.
Well, this ought to show them we mean business.
Yeah.
- Will?
- Yo?
What do we do now?
We chant.
Attica!
Man, you smell that?
Damn, it's chimichanga day in the cafeteria.
Yo, Marge, you should have seen me.
It was dope.
Me and my man Cornflake barricaded ourself in Mr. Knotts' classroom, right?
It took the whole football team to break down the door and when they came in, we was chanting, "Make love, not war".
Right on, Hasani, but why were you chanting "Make love, not war"?
We was kind of hoping the cheerleaders would overhear.
Sweetheart, this is not a joke.
Now, your antics got you suspended for three days.
Now go to your room.
Looks like I've had quite an impact on your kids.
You're proud of getting a high school kid suspended?
If you mean, am I proud to have told him to do anything you have to for what you believe in then, yes, I am.
Marge, when you talked to Will about when we chained ourselves together at sit-ins, you're only giving him the romantic part of the struggle.
Girlfriend, you are leaving out everything that went before it.
The leaflets, the petitions, the years of trying to work through the system.
If the system doesn't work, you have to blow the door down.
Looks like you forgot that.
You talk as if I wasn't there with you in Birmingham facing dogs and fire hoses.
This is me, Olifami.
The same Olifami that was with you the night Harlem went up in flames.
But now I have a family and I choose not to fight in the streets.
I have an office to fight from and I have fought and won cases for fair housing, affirmative action health care and I am not ashamed to write a big fat check for something I believe in and that doesn't make me any less committed than you.
So don't you dare look down your damn nose at me, Adibola.
I guess I've overstayed my welcome.
Marge you are welcome to stay here until you can figure out where you want to go.
But if you ever want to stop running Viv and I will be here for you.
Marge.
Where Uncle Olifami?
He's in the study with Adisimbol.
Oh, yeah, good thing he ain't in here.
Because if he was I might just have to run back up to my room.
What you doing?
Now that The Man's after me, I think it's best for me to split.
Yeah, well, you know, you got to get back to your work.
Yeah.
Hey, I heard that there was an anti-apartheid rally in D.C. Yeah, I may swing by.
I knew you'd understand, Will.
All right.
So I'll be ready in about 10 minutes.
- For what?
- Yo, I'm gonna go with you.
Man, if we gonna be underground, though, I'll probably need another name.
How about, Akbar Shabash Jenkins?
Will, you're a kid.
You belong at home.
You're only 17.
By the time you were 17, you burned your first bra.
Baby, you can't do what I did.
But I could go get one of Hilary's.
What I mean is, you have to find your own way, Will.
You know, when I was your age there weren't many doors open to us.
Some of them we had to blow open, and because we did you've got more opportunities.
Don't get me wrong.
I am not saying that things are perfect.
It's just that now you can fight our battles in the boardrooms, too.
And in the classrooms, the voting booths, and the courtroom.
Just like your uncle.
All right, hold it.
I thought you said "by any means necessary".
Right, but it's up to you to figure out what's necessary.
And, Will, when the courtroom doesn't work, come find me.
You're a deep sister, Adibola.
And you are the future, Hasani.
Agent Marcus Collins of the FBI.
If you need me, I'll be upstairs saluting the flag.
- Philip Banks, my wife, Vivian.
- Hello.
How do you do?
I understand you're acquainted with a woman named Margaret Smallwood?
I have reason to believe she's been in contact with you, Mr. Banks.
Really?
What would that reason be?
We tap every Black person's phone in the United States of America.
Just a little FBI humor.
But seriously, folks, harboring a fugitive can have grave repercussions.
Marjorie Smallwood is a very close personal friend of mine.
I consider myself privileged to know her.
She was here, but she left some time this afternoon.
Do you have any idea where she was headed?
As a matter of fact, she said she was going to a nuclear power plant in Texas.
But then again, she did mention a migrant workers' camp in Salinas.
No, honey, she said she was going to a voters' registration drive in Biloxi.
Well, I thought she was just going to Saks.
Get the heck out of here.
You all mean she ain't in the bathroom?
I must say, I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Banks.
I would have thought a man in your position would be more aware of his responsibilities.
I know exactly what my responsibilities are.
Son, would you show Agent Collins to the door?
By the way, I don't think we've met.
Ricky Ricardo.
Yo, Hil, check out my horoscope.
"You will become a famous rapper with your own TV show.
" That's dope, right?
Those things are ridiculous.
What does mine say?
It says, "You are headed for a fall.
Beware.
Accidents can happen".
Those things are so stupid.
I wonder what I'll call my TV show?
English
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Fry, Geoffrey.
Fry, Geoffrey.
Having breakfast with Rico Suave?
No, Mom and Robert sent me this from the time they was in Mexico.
That looks just like the hat you gave me for my birthday.
Don't worry, G. I'll have it back in your room in an hour, man.
Geoffrey, would you put these in a vase for me please?
Yes, madam.
I got all of Vy's favorite things: Pineapple juice, brownies - How did this Playboy get in here?
- I bought it.
It's a special legal edition.
The centerfold wants to be a Supreme Court Justice.
I had the hardest time deciding what to wear to meet Aunt Vy's new boyfriend.
I've never known anyone in construction.
Except for that guy in the Village People.
Yeah, well, his daughter can sleep in my room, but if she touches my stuff I'm stuffing her in the clothes hamper.
What?
It's not like Hilary never did it.
Well, I am so excited.
This is the first time Vy's brought anybody home to meet the family.
- Could be serious.
- No, no, no.
Not with my mom.
All she's trying to do is get to her retirement plan and her rocking chair.
Is that why she's moonwalking up the driveway?
Divas!
Look at you, baby!
- Hey, your complexion has cleared up.
- Yeah, Mom.
So did yours.
- Hey, you must be Robert.
- You're funny.
You must be Carlton.
Well, no, you see, actually, Carlton is the funny-looking one over there.
See, I'm Will.
But you can just call me Your Majesty.
I may be small, but I'm not ignorant.
Everyone, this is Robert's daughter, Claudia.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Hi, Claudia, I'm Hilary.
- Hi, Hilary.
Oh, my God!
Isn't she the cutest little thing you've ever seen?
Not really.
And I would like for you to meet Robert.
And isn't he the biggest hunk you've ever seen?
Not really.
Where is Vy?
Breakfast is getting cold.
- Knowing Vy, she's upstairs freshening up.
- Oh, no, no.
Not my mom.
First thing she does when she gets anywhere is she kicks off her shoes rolls her hair up into one of them twist joints and goes and puts on one of my big old sweat suits.
Sorry, everybody, I just had to freshen up a little bit.
You like my new pearls, Will?
Yeah, but they would probably look better with one of my big old sweat suits.
- You can borrow them anytime, baby.
- Wait, Mom, hold up.
I put your favorite breakfast together for you.
It's waffles with boysenberry syrup eggs, extra-runny and sausage, extra-burnt.
Thank you, baby, but I'm eating lighter these days.
You want half my melon?
Oh, baby, you know me like the back of your hand.
But I need some juice.
Anybody else want anything while I'm up?
Hey, as long as I'm around, you're not lifting a finger.
May I?
Philip?
I feel a little thirsty, too.
Robert?
Do you mind getting Vivian something to drink while you're up there?
And toss me a Pudding Pop.
The refrigerator doesn't open right.
You mind if I take a look at it?
Be my guest, but the repairman said we had to order some new door hinges.
Yo, hold up, Robert.
I can take care of that.
Hey, G, I'm gonna need a screwdriver, a wrench, a T square and about a week off from school.
All done.
Oh, sure.
It's just gonna break again in 20 years.
Robert can fix anything.
He's in construction.
- Tell them, baby.
- I'm in construction.
But keep your fingers crossed.
He's working on this big deal with the government and he's expecting to hear from them any day.
If the deal goes through, he'll be his own boss.
All right.
Yo, I'm working on a big deal.
You know, down at the restaurant where I work?
I'm about to be promoted to vice president in charge of keeping bums out of the entryway.
So, Robert, you know how to fix a broken dish?
- Sure.
You got any superglue?
- I was talking about our satellite dish.
So am I. Well Sweetie, why don't you show Claudia our back yard?
Well, why?
It's hot, it's smoggy and plus, I won't be able to hear nothing y'all are saying.
That's the point, big guy.
Come on.
So, did he pop the question?
- Ashley, honey, where are your manners?
- I'm sorry.
- Did he pop the question, please?
- Not yet.
But he's planning on building this dream house and he did mention his-and-hers sinks.
Let the maids worry about the sinks.
What does he drive?
The important question is, does his mother like you?
- She's dead.
- Girlfriend, you in.
I like your bracelet.
I bet it would look very cute on my little wrist.
- Sorry, a friend gave this to me.
- That's cool.
I'm not down with O.P.P. Anyway.
- You wanna see some pictures?
- Yeah, sure.
Whoa, that's you and my mom.
My dad took it in the back yard.
We were having a barbecue.
Claudia, now, after this barbecue you know, you guys had the junk and all the stuff in your teeth.
Did my mom have to go home to use her toothbrush or did she already have one there?
She used dental floss.
Okay, is my mom over your house more during Good Morning America or Arsenio?
Or, is she like there for Arsenio and then still there for Good Morning America?
Are you trying to trick me to find out how serious they are?
So, what, you think they're pretty serious?
Will, I know how you feel.
Believe me, I've been there.
Let's face it: Those two kids are nuts about each other.
My brother, it's time you wake up and smell the Play-Doh.
Hi, baby.
Mom!
You half-naked!
Come on, you don't want Robert to get the wrong idea.
You damn straight!
You don't think I'm doing these butt-busters for my health?
Okay, that's it, young lady.
You go to your room in Philly.
Boy, hush up and help me move this table.
Can we get started?
I feel a little bloated.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold up, Mom.
How you gonna play me?
Why you ain't hook me up with one of them pink jumpies?
I couldn't find one with a fly.
And one, and two, and three, and four Man, Jane Fonda got a butt like Arsenio.
Yo, I could do that if I had the right outfit.
Maybe not.
I'd like to have kids one day.
Yo, man, what's up?
Oh, man, you caught me.
I was trying to surprise you.
When you say "surprise," you don't mean like "I'm driving down a big hill, and all of a sudden: "Surprise!
My brakes don't work"?
You got the same sense of humor as your mom, you know that?
Now, don't be trying to distract me.
What you doing to my ride?
Hey, your mom and I borrowed the car.
I saw you needed a water pump, so I picked one up.
Hey, that's pretty decent of you, man.
- You need some help?
- Nope.
All done.
She'll purr like a kitten.
- My grandpa taught me how to fix cars.
- That's fascinating.
- Where'd you meet my mom?
- She picked me up in a bar.
Hey, man!
It was an oyster bar.
You see, I was a little shy, so Luckily, she came up and she talked to me.
- So, what'd she talk about?
- You.
Is it true you took your diaper off and ran around Sears naked?
You're damn right, and I'd do it again if I had to.
Robert!
It's Mr. Karls from the Department of Housing.
I think this is the call, baby!
Hello.
Right.
He does have a certain gift for gab.
Yeah.
Hey, okay.
Well, thank you very much.
I got the job!
So what kind of marble do you want for those his-and-hers sinks?
Congratulations, Robert.
Landing a government contract is a hell of a deal.
I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived by: Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money.
That's beautiful, Dad.
I have to admit, success is sweet.
But having three beautiful women to share it with makes it even sweeter.
Especially when they're triplets.
I'll get the munchies.
Hey, congratulations, Robert.
It's nice to hear you gonna have some money now.
I guess them old girlfriends gonna be coming out of the woodworks, huh?
Actually, your mother's the only woman I've dated since my divorce.
That is so sweet!
Isn't it, Philip?
Philip?
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was looking for some beer nuts.
Philip, I feel pretty lucky.
How about that tennis game you promised me?
You got it.
Uncle Phil, no jumping over the net.
This is such a big night for Robert.
I wanna make him a special dinner.
Honey, save the rice.
You'll be needing it for the wedding.
What?
Whoa, come on.
Mom, now look, I didn't want to bring this up, but I was standing behind Robert in the mirror Dude ain't got no reflection!
Stop fooling around.
I really wanna fix Robert something special.
- What should I make?
- How about reservations?
Hey, what about Will's favorite dish?
It's not every day he gets to have his mom prepare him a home-cooked meal.
You know, Carlton, you're right.
So, what would my son like for dinner?
- I feel like something exotic.
- Okay.
How about Lebanese?
You think Robert will mind swinging by Beirut?
I'm sorry, Geoffrey, you better reheat the asparagus.
Will's still not here.
So, how's the chicken holding up?
I'm afraid it's drier than happy hour at the Betty Ford Center, madam.
I cannot believe Will is acting like this.
Did I do something?
Maybe it was a mistake bringing Robert and Claudia here.
Vy, honey, don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm sure there's a good reason, and it has nothing to do with you and Robert.
Mom, we're starved.
And Claudia's being selfish with her Pez.
Carlton, you just have to know how to ask.
Now can I have Barbie's head back?
Listen, Will's not gonna show up.
Why don't you kids just go ahead on and eat?
- Good.
- Good.
The Willster must be feeling pretty low to pull a stunt like this.
I haven't seen him this upset since someone told him he looked like me.
He's just hard-headed!
I don't know where he gets it from.
I do: He gets it from you.
I am the understanding sister.
Helen is the loud one, Janice is the flighty one and you are the hard-headed one.
I thought I was the sweet one.
You said you were the sweet one.
When we tried to tell you you weren't you wouldn't listen because you're too hard-headed.
As much as I enjoy these wonderful walks down memory lane, I'm pooped.
I'm going to bed.
Look, why don't we try to enjoy what's left of dinner?
Wait a minute.
How can you eat at a time like this?
Vivian, I can't get this out of my mind.
How can you say that I am hard-headed?
Gee, Vy, I don't know where I could have gotten that idea.
Will, thank God I found you.
Carlton, how did you know I was down here?
Did my mom send you down here to get me?
No.
Oh.
I snuck out.
I was worried about you.
Well, as you can see, I'm fine.
Will, you don't have to hide behind that macho exterior with me.
I see your frightened inner child and I'm here to say come out and play.
You been watching too much Oprah, man.
You can never watch too much Oprah.
If it wasn't for her show, I'd still be in denial about my drinking.
Will, look, I know how you feel about Robert but you're not the only one who gets jealous.
How do you think I felt when you moved in?
- What, you was jealous of me?
- Sure.
You're tall you're good at basketball, the babes love you.
Of course, none of that will help you in the corporate world, but for the next year or so you're sitting pretty.
It was real nice of you to come down here, man.
You ain't seeing my girlfriend or nothing, are you?
Will, I just want you to know if your mom abandons you and gets married you'll always have me.
Because well, you're like the brother I've always wanted.
- Thanks a lot, Carlton.
- For not hugging you, right?
No, you know, for saying that I'm like the brother that you always wanted.
And for not hugging me, man.
Robert, I'm sorry, this hasn't turned out to be much of a celebration.
Vy, I'm the one that should apologize.
It was all my fault.
I was so eager for Will to like me, I came on too strong.
So, how was dinner?
Any leftovers?
Where the hell have you been?
Boy, time flies when you're running up to your bedroom.
I'm right behind you, Carlton.
I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone, what with your man here, and all.
Don't you use that tone of walk with me.
Now, you sit your butt down before I sit it down for you.
All right, but I'm picking my own chair.
Boy, sit down.
What a coincidence.
That's the one I was going to pick.
William, you have ruined what was supposed to be a very special evening.
Yeah, well, you ruined what was supposed to be a very special visit.
It ain't like I get to see you all the time.
Why you have to bring them, anyway?
I brought them because they're important to me and I wanted them to meet the most important person in my life.
Mom, did you ever think about what I wanted?
I mean, "Robert's my man.
Claudia's so adorable".
You went off and started a whole new family without me.
Baby, don't you know there is no family without you?
Nobody can take your place.
I'm your mother.
But I'm human, honey, I have needs, too.
Do you expect me to be alone forever?
Yeah.
I mean, you done good this far.
I think you're being very immature.
Am not.
You're the only parent I got, and I don't want to share you.
Well, I'm sorry, baby, that is not your decision.
Will, listen, I am not with Robert because he makes you feel bad.
I'm with him because he makes me feel good.
You're my son, baby.
I love you, I care about you but I have got to live my own life.
Now, you can ruin what's left of this trip or you can make it work.
It's up to you.
But, that's all that's up to you.
- Hi, Will!
- Hey, Claudia.
You know, Will, there are a lot of advantages to our parents getting together.
The guilt alone will get us both ponies.
Well, no, I'm not into using guilt for my personal gain.
Temper tantrums.
That's where the money is.
You slay me, Will.
You know, Will, you would make a great brother.
I'm not so bad, either.
When you take me to the parks with you, I can attract more babes than a puppy.
What time is your flight?
I hate saying goodbye to you, Vy, it's the only time I cry.
Are you kidding, child?
You cry more than Richard Simmons.
- Thanks for the hospitality.
- Our pleasure.
Just be sure you take care of Vy.
Robert, hold up, man.
I just wanted to apologize for messing up your celebration.
- Next time you come out, dinner on me?
- I appreciate it, man.
I'll be right there.
- I guess this is goodbye.
- I guess it is.
He's all right.
Well, you all right, too.
In fact, you are the greatest son a mom ever had.
- I'm gonna miss you, Claudia.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.
Thanks for letting me polish your shoes hang up your clothes, and vacuum your room.
It was really fun playing Geoffrey.
What?
It's not like Hilary never did it.
- Come on, Claudia.
- Bye, Will.
Wait, hold up, Claudia.
I think you're forgetting something.
But your friend gave it to you.
Yeah, but you're a better friend.
And besides, you can spy on my mom for me.
I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived by: Mo' money, mo' money I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived by Trying to be a professional here!

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Will, a deal's a deal.
You picked the movie, I pick the restaurant.
Please, man.
This ain't no restaurant.
I mean, there wasn't even no golden arches outside.
Will, please.
You're this far from washing windshields with newspaper.
Now, just sit down and try to go a half-hour without saying "yo".
Yo, yo, yo.
I'll have two of those.
Ladies, hello.
This is your lucky day.
You know, anyone who sits in these chairs gets served on the house.
Yo, Carlton, man, they French girls.
We in!
Yo, they don't have no standards, man.
They like Jerry Lewis.
Look, now.
Check it out.
Follow my lead.
I'm a rich and famous rap star.
You always get to be the rap star.
This time I'll be the rap star and you be Gary Coleman.
- Ahem.
Bonjour, slimmies.
- Bonjour.
Bonjour, je suis un tres important rap star.
- Vraiment!
Un rap star!
- C'est fantastique.
I love rap.
I am Renee and this is Monique and what do you call yourself?
He's Tiny By Nature.
So, how would you ladies like to spend an evening in Tiny's Bel-Air mansion?
- Monique, he has a mansion.
- A big one.
A tennis court, swimming pool, excellent school system.
How about tomorrow night?
We're only going to be in LA for four days.
Excuse us for just one sec.
Yo, when are Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv going out of town?
Tomorrow through Monday.
But what do we do about Hilary and Ashley?
Lie?
Oh, no, man.
Come on, they're family.
We bribe them.
Yeah, tomorrow night will be perfect.
Separate checks, please.
Tomorrow we go French.
But tonight we go Dutch.
Game plan for tonight, Will.
As soon as the parental units are out of the house we pick the girls up at the hotel.
Then, we ply them with Perrier to get them in the mood.
Hey, Carlton, they're French girls.
They're always in the mood.
Do you know the French word for foreplay?
Because there isn't one.
Okay, sweetheart, I am counting on you to take care of your sister while your father and I are at the jazz festival.
Okay.
But last time I squealed on Hilary I found Barbie face down in the aquarium.
Boy, boy.
You kids and your music.
When I was young, lyrics meant something.
I was scatting, Will.
That's the most expressive form of singing.
For example Vivian, gonna be late Vivian, gonna be late All right.
Hilary, honey, here's the number where your father and I are going to be staying at the hotel.
- Okay, I am ready.
- Okay.
Wait!
I forgot my purse.
Has anybody seen my old brown bag?
Excuse me.
You used to call me Diva.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Vivian.
Well, what a wonderful surprise!
I'll put these in the guest room.
So this is what a hernia feels like.
Well, Bobby's visiting Lester's parents for the weekend so I decided to take a little trip.
Now, you know I'm always doing things on the spur on the moment.
Buy a new hat, paint the house, get a divorce.
Not again.
This time he's gone too far.
Hey, does Uncle Lester still do that "pull my finger" thing in church?
I don't want to talk about it.
Not in front of the young one.
That means it's about sex.
Either Uncle Lester is seeing another woman or becoming one.
Ashley, don't be ridiculous.
And no more Oprah.
Shoot!
And it's transvestite week.
I'm afraid Ashley's right.
I think Lester's messing around.
Look, I just need a place to stay for a while.
Oh, yeah, Aunt Helen, that's cool.
You can have my room.
In Philly.
Will, don't be so insensitive.
You're staying at the Howard Johnson's, and I won't take no for an answer.
Boys, knock it off.
Philip, we cannot go to San Francisco.
Now, don't be canceling anything because of me.
I'll be fine.
You heard what she said.
She'll be fine.
Let's go, Vivian.
I am not leaving at a time like this.
Come on, sweetie, I'll help you unpack.
Okay.
What about our date?
This is so unfair.
You're telling me?
I stayed up all night learning the French for "Forget about my cousin, y'all can both have me".
- Sweetheart, I feel so bad about this.
- Me, too.
You poor thing.
You know what?
I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna buy something really nice.
Oh, sweetie, that's all right.
You don't have to buy me anything.
I know.
I meant for me.
Honey, you know, all married couples go through rough times.
- But maybe if you just talk to Lester - Talk to him?
Girl, I wouldn't give Lester air if he was in a jug.
Well, sweetheart, I don't mean to pry and you don't have to give me all the gory details, but Vivian, I told you.
There is another woman in his life, and I don't mean his ugly mama.
- But Lester is crazy about you.
- Was.
Now he's just crazy.
You know how some men are animals in bed?
Yes.
Well, I don't.
Well, I know how that goes.
One day last month, I met Philip at the door wearing nothing, honey, but Saran Wrap and a smile.
Walked right past me and said, "Hi, honey, did you make that meatloaf"?
Well, at least he spoke.
Vivian.
Vivian, last night I followed Lester.
He drove over to this cute little house with this cute little picket fence and this cute little homewrecker opened the door.
I would have been reaching for my cute little crowbar.
I couldn't find it.
Anyway, she let him in and he stayed.
For how long?
Let's just say I got tired of waiting.
Look, mesdemoiselles, un petit change of plans for tonight.
Instead of you coming over here, we're going to rendezvous at your hotel.
All right.
But, please, baby.
Baby, listen.
Can I talk for a second, baby?
It's just that, you know, somebody kind of dropped by the mansion you know, unexpectedly, you know.
So we - Who dropped by?
- Aunt Helen.
What?
No.
You thought he said Aunt Helen?
No, no.
He said Van Halen.
Well, not to worry, my little chocolate truffles.
You can come by tomorrow night.
Prince and Hammer are coming by to play Yahtzee.
Oh, sorry, gotta go.
Barry White's here.
It's 7:15.
Right now, Bobby McFerrin is performing.
I love Bobby McFerrin.
Not as much as we love French Toast.
Dad, call me optimistic but I'm sure you'll still make it to the jazz festival.
Aunt Helen's probably blown this whole thing out of proportion.
You're probably right.
Smith women tend to do that.
I remember one day I came home from work after a really rough time.
I think we were having meatloaf for dinner.
Anyway, your Aunt Vivian was really furious at me because I forgot to mention her dress, or Oh, my God!
Vivian!
Tomorrow on Geraldo, French women who can't say "no".
It's not fair, Will.
Monique is everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
Beautiful, sexy, and she measures everything in centimeters.
Hey, look, man, all I know is if we don't get this house cleared out by tonight the only sweet things we gonna be near is a couple Klondike bars.
Vivian, sweetheart, come here, please.
Hurry.
Come on.
There is no more Saran Wrap and Baggies are out of the question.
No, sweetheart, it's not that.
Helen, could you come in here please?
Now, listen.
I made some phone calls and I managed to scare up an extra ticket to the jazz festival.
So we can all go.
Me, you and Helen.
I love you, Uncle Phil!
I'll get the bags and the car.
Hell, I'll carry you there if I have to.
Excuse me, Mrs. Lewis, but you have a visitor.
- Me?
Who is it?
- Your husband, Mr. Lewis.
Sir, I hope you brought your protective cup.
Sweetie pie, get your bags.
The taxi's waiting.
Would someone please inform Action Jackson over there that I'm not going anywhere with him?
But, Helen, you're my wife.
If you refuse to leave with me you know what I'm gonna have to do.
Drag her home by her extensions?
Nope.
I'm gonna stay right here with you until you change your mind.
Good old Aunt Jemima.
Now, that's a strong woman.
I never saw her with a man.
Actually, I hear that she and the Quaker Oats dude got kind of a Jungle Fever thing going.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning, Lester.
- I just lost my appetite.
- Helen, please.
All right, I'll stay, but I'm not talking to him.
Not after what he did.
Baby, I know things aren't going perfect, but why did you leave me?
Was it because I left my wet underwear hanging on your wig stand?
Wrong, but an interesting concept.
Then what was it?
The time I took that picture of you on the toilet?
That's it.
I am never getting married.
Lester, perhaps you'd like to continue this conversation in private.
How about if you continued it at home?
I'll get your bags.
You know what?
In fact, forget your bags, we'll mail them to you.
Just go, you crazy kids in love.
I apologize.
This is no way for civilized people to behave in someone else's home.
- No need to, Helen.
- It won't happen again.
Good.
Now, shall we just enjoy the rest of Geoffrey's meal?
Amen to that.
Hilary, would you please ask the adulterer on your right to pass the biscuits?
What?
Dr. Connors, please.
It's her patient, Lester.
No, not Lester the schizophrenic, Lester the impotent guy.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Hello, Anita.
It's me, Lester.
Helen's driving me crazy.
I needed to talk to you.
No, I didn't tell her about you.
And I think seeing you was a mistake.
I mean, I really like you, and you're really good at what you do but there's part of me that would prefer a man.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not about you.
It's about me and Helen and Look, maybe now isn't such a good time to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
Oh, man.
How you trying to play my aunt, man?
Oh, that's it.
I'm feeling froggy.
I'm about to leap.
Hey, but, hold up.
Would you really prefer a man?
- Wait a minute, Will.
- Back up, man.
You think Wait.
Anita's my psychiatrist, Will.
Oh, yeah, right.
And I just won a Grammy.
Come on.
Come on, man to man, toe to toe, come on.
Will, I understand your anger and if you want to take out your passive-aggressive feelings towards your absent father on me then go ahead.
Man, you really must be seeing a shrink.
Hey, what does it mean when you dream that you're flying through a tunnel on a Scud missile?
Wait, hold up.
Aunt Helen saw you going into Anita's house.
She thinks y'all knocking boots.
- What?
- Yeah.
Will, would you turn down the Get away from him, Will.
You don't owe him anything.
I'm the one who signed his name to all your damn birthday cards.
Well, Aunt Helen, look, Uncle Lester got something to tell you.
The woman that he's been seeing, she's not no regular woman she's a doctor.
A doctor!
Oh, that's good!
A doctor!
Well, this'll give you a reason to see more of her, Lester.
Helen!
Stop it, Helen!
Who is that?
I'm sorry, Aunt Helen.
My shower's broken.
Uncle Phil fixed it.
Looks like he fixed this door, too.
Yo!
Somebody let me out!
What's up?
What's happening?
What the hell is going on?
"Gee, Will, where were you when you were supposed to be "with two luscious French girls"?
"I was trapped in a bathroom with my naked aunt".
Helen, now that I've got you in a room without books there's something I've got to tell you.
Ain't nobody gonna tell me nothing!
Lester, don't make me get ethnic on you!
Oh, damn.
Woman, would you for once let me do the talking?
- Now, Anita is a - I bet the hussy has a weave.
And she's younger than I am, too.
Isn't she?
Anita's my psychiatrist.
I've been seeing her since I was passed over for that promotion at the plant.
When I missed out on that job, I lost my confidence.
Well, I knew you lost something but I didn't know it was your confidence.
Well, why do you think I started seeing a shrink?
- Will, cover your ears.
- Yes, ma'am.
How could you think I was even seeing another woman?
Well, you know what they say.
If the rooster ain't crowing in the henhouse he must be cock-a-doodling in the barn.
Helen, I wasn't cock-a-doodling anywhere.
When that job went south, well, my doodle went with it.
You know I'm crazy about you, baby.
Well, I wish you would have said something.
But, knowing me, I wouldn't have listened anyway.
I'm sorry, baby.
I still should have told you about Anita.
I'm the one who's sorry.
It was worth it if it worked.
Did it?
Did it work?
There's only one way to find out.
Guys?
Help me!
Somebody let me out of here!
They doing it.
I hope you two aren't upset about missing the jazz festival.
Don't be ridiculous.
What's important is that you and Lester are back together again.
Right on.
Besides, I'm sure it'll never happen again.
No.
Because we love each other too much.
No.
Because we're moving and we're not gonna tell you where.
Bye, baby.
Take care, now.
Okay.
Vivian, we gotta go.
Our reservation's for 7:00.
Philip, you know we so seldom have the house all to ourselves.
Instead of going out, why don't we just spend a quiet evening at home?
- Together.
Just the two of us.
- Sounds good to me.
Vivian, when's the last time we skinny-dipped in the Jacuzzi?
I don't think it was the Fourth of July, but I do remember fireworks.
I'll get the champagne.
You get the nose plugs.
All right.
They left for dinner.
Now, remember.
We don't have that much time until they get back.
- How would you like to see Tiny's Jacuzzi?
- Jacuzzi?
But, Monique, we do not have the bathing suits.
No problem, neither do we.
Right this way, ladies.
Yeah, let me turn on the bubbles.
Hey, what's up Uncle Phil?
Uncle Phil?
- Will!
- Father!
- Carlton!
- Mother!
Lester, don't make me have to get ethnic on Don't make me have to get ethnic on you!
You get the champagne.
I'll get the champagne.
- Somebody get the damn champagne.
- I'm just so excited.
Aunt Helen You're staying at the Howard Johnson.
I couldn't say anything after that.
He should really shut up now, but he won't.

Hilary, as a loyal Republican and a staunch Bush man I'm warning you, don't do this.
Oh, come on, Carlton.
You're not a Bush man.
You're more like a Pygmy.
Will, I'm trying to keep Hilary from embarrassing all of us in front of the whole Republican Party.
- Are you joining the Republican Party?
- No, I'm going to it.
Arnold Schwarzenegger's having a pool party.
I can't decide if I got the right suit.
Oh, darn.
Now Arnold's gonna have to return his.

Is that terrible?
No.
Is it terrible that I want to kiss you back?
Can I blow in your ear?
Why?
I don't know.
I heard Will say it.
Okay.
- What's it doing?
- I think it's giving me an earache.
It wasn't doing much for me, either.
Besides, I like kissing better.
Me, too.
Hi, kids.
Having fun?
This one is so cute.
I don't want to be cute tonight, Hilary.
I've always been cute.
I'm up to here with cute.
Ashley, talk to me.
This isn't just about clothes, is it?
It's about something a lot more important.
It's a bad hair day, isn't it?
Honey, have you seen my Obsession perfume?
Oh, baby, this is the perfect choice for tonight.
I think this is the cutest outfit you have.
Okay, I'm cute.
Can we move on now?
You remember the first boy you had over to watch TV, Hilary?
Please.
I don't remember the guy I went out with last week.
All my babies are growing up.
I feel a little chat coming on.
See you.
Ashley, honey, let's have a little talk, okay?
Do we have to?
Honey, I just want to say that I know this is your first time having Kevin over without your father and I at home.
Now, I know your body's going through some changes and I Mom!

I'll just get my jacket.
Ashley, sweetheart.
Now, before Kevin comes over I think I should have a little talk with you about boys.
Great, Daddy.
They're all dogs, got it?
Have a good time, sweetheart.
Ashley, you hit me in my stomach with this thing.
Had it been Carlton, you could've put his eye out.
Sorry, Will.
I was just upset about that stupid outfit Hilary picked out.
If you don't like it, why don't you just say so?
'Cause everyone's too busy going Yeah.
I know how you feel.
My mom still asks me if I went boom-boom.
Will, you're the only one who doesn't treat me like a baby.
You've been out with lots of girls.
Yeah, this has been an exceptional week.
No.
What I mean is, well I like Kevin.
And, well, I know he really likes me.
And I kind of need some advice.
Well, I know what it's like being 13, Ashley.
And I just have to say, if you want to kiss Kevin, go for it.
I've already kissed him.
- Oh, no.
I mean, on the lips.
- So do I. Will, I need to know everything you know about sex.
Look, Ashley.
Don't you think sex is something you should discuss with Aunt Viv?
You know, like, over a cup of General Foods International Coffee?
Look, I mean, it's hard enough for me to accept the fact that Mom and Dad even did it.
I don't want to talk about it with them.
Besides, we've already discussed all the technical stuff.
I mean, I know all about eggs, fallopian tubes Am I gonna have to wash your mouth out with soap, young lady?
Will, grow up.
I'm old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis.
Look, if Mom and Dad knew about all these weird feelings I'm starting to have, they'd freak.
- Promise not to tell them?
- All right.
But I want you to stop having these feelings.
- You don't want to be that kind of girl.
- You mean the kind you like?
What is this?
The Spanish Inquisition?
Look, Will, when a girl doesn't fool around you never call her back.
There's a reason for that, Ashley.
Not one I'm proud of, but there's a reason for that.
It's 'cause there's nothing to remember.
Now, how come it's okay for you and not for me?
Look, it's just Look, well Look, I can't answer all these questions, Ashley.
And I thought you were the one person who would understand.
I do understand, Ashley.
You know, it's just that I just need a little time to get prepared, all right?
But I thought you knew everything about sex.
Yeah, well Look, I just, you know I just want to make sure there haven't been any new developments, you know in the last day or so.
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot for helping me, Will.
I'm so excited!
Will you stop talking dirty?
- Hi, Will.
Is Ashley ready?
- No, man.
She's only 13!
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi, Ashley.
- So, you wanna go watch some TV now?
- Sure.
- I mean, if you do.
- Sure.
TV.
What a great idea!
Come on, let's go into the family room for some nice family fun.
Come on, kids, have a seat.
Let's watch some TV.
Okay.
Couple number two.
Where's the most unusual place you've ever made whoopee?
Boy, that was good.
Hey, how about some music?
I wanna sex you up Filth.
- I like that song.
- You would.
You men disgust me.
Hey, there's my favorite cousin.
Come over here and have a seat with us.
Hey, move over, man.
- Will, I'm late to pick up Dora.
- Come on.
Now wouldn't you much rather spend time with us playing a nice sweet game of Duck-Duck-Goose?
Dora can tie a slipknot with her tongue.
Okay.
Who ate all the whipped cream?
Is there no end to you people's preoccupation with sex?
Somebody's girlfriend got grounded again?
May I please speak to the two of you in the kitchen?
Right now?
It's Ashley.
Now, look, you can't tell Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv.
But she asked me to tell her about sex.
I don't know what to tell her.
I mean, she should hear it from somebody more experienced.
Well, pardon me for being attractive.
Look, I'm the wrong person.
I mean, I tried to tell Carlton about sex And, well, you know the rest.
Look, well, somebody has to tell her.
I mean, she won't do anything stupid if she has some good solid facts.
Wrong, my hot-blooded cousin.
If you tell her about sex, she's just gonna run out and do it.
Oh, that's ridiculous, Carlton.
We wanna expose her to a realistic portrayal of relationships.
I know.
We'll rent Pretty Woman.
Well, here we are to get information for our book report.
I'm just here to check the place for asbestos.
This is embarrassing, Will.
Why did you have to drag me down here anyway?
Please.
Look at this face.
You think anybody's gonna believe I have questions about sex?
Is there a John Doe and a Joan Crawford?
I choked, okay?
Present.
Hi, I'm Miss Rinkoff.
I'm one of the counselors here.
Right this way, please.
Shall we step into your office and talk about asbestos?
Asbestos?
Last I heard, it was called knocking boots.
Please, have a seat.
Now, how can I help you?
By turning into an old ugly man.
Boys, there's no reason to be embarrassed about sex.
- Hey, we're all adults here.
- Exactly.
Everyone has questions about their reproductive organs.
Must you be so raw?
Well, actually, it's about my cousin.
- His sister.
She's 13.
- Is she pregnant?
Hey, that's my sister you're talking about.
I'm sorry to say it, but that's reality.
These days more and more teenage girls are having sex.
They certainly don't go to our school.
Look, we can't control people's actions but we can help kids make wise choices, not stupid ones.
Here.
Here's a pamphlet called The Truth about Sex.
- Thank you very much.
- Nope, wait a minute.
And here's one about the prevention of pregnancy.
Here's one about AIDS.
And here's one about dealing with your emotions.
- Sure a lot of stuff to read.
- Yes, I know.
That's why I think this is something your parents should be discussing with you and your cousin.
That's not likely with Uncle Phil.
He won't let us watch Snow White 'cause she lives with seven dwarfs.
- Thank you.
- Not so fast.
I think it's wonderful you have information for your cousin - but what about you?
- I practice abstinence.
But I think I've got that down and I'm ready to move on.
Will!
Hey, check it out.
Black folks playing tennis.
I wonder if there's a white guy somewhere tap-dancing.
Kids, we found these pamphlets.
Is there anything anyone here would like to discuss?
Okay.
Who's pregnant?
Hey, not me.
Not me.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and make that unanimous.
Now, somebody in this house needs to talk about sex and it ain't one of us.
But that only leaves Oh, God, tell me it's Geoffrey.
I think it's our not-so-little girl.
Okay, kids.
Your father and I need to talk alone.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil.
Now, just remember that sex is as natural as breathing.
And I'm gonna hold my breath till I'm married.
I can still remember the night Ashley was born.
She looked like a beautiful, little, black Winston Churchill.
Seems like yesterday.
Our baby's not a baby anymore, is she?
You know, I knew it was time to have a talk with her and I tried to the other night but I just couldn't face the fact - that she was having sexual feelings.
- Vivian.
Vivian, how could this happen to us?
We live in a good neighborhood, they go to good schools.
She's never even had a cavity, for God's sake.
Vivian, times have changed since you and I were young.
Hell, they've changed since Hilary and Carlton were young.
Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
You pack your bags, we are moving to Greenland.
Now, this is not easy for me, either, but this is our job, honey.
- We're parents.
- You're right.
We can do this.
We can do it.
Hi!
I can't do it.
Can't do what, Daddy?
We want to talk to you.
About sex.
I know where babies come from.
I took sex education.
I thought you took band.
Now, I know that there are some feelings you're experiencing as a young woman.
And I just wanna know, do you have questions?
Well, a few.
Then we'll do our best to answer them for you.
Thanks.
Kevin asked his mom a question and she fainted.
Well, I guess the first thing I better do, then, is sit down.
Dora can tie a - Slipknot.
- Slipknot.
Dora can fit a whole orange in her mouth.
Dora.
In your phonebook?

Will, give me all your money.
I'm sorry, Carlton.
I don't feel like playing 7-Eleven.
This isn't a game, Will.
I know you have $50, and I need it.
Forget it, man.
$50?
I could take Look, listen carefully, Will.
And I know you can hear me with ears that big.
Biff's dad is a bankruptcy lawyer and according to him Westworld Airlines is about to fall prey to a corporate raider.
Word?
Man, I don't believe that.
A corporate raider?
What the bloody hell are you talking about?
It's called inside information, and it's quite illegal.
So is that French nanny you're dating.
Enough said.
The point is I've only got $50, and I need $100 to buy the stock.
All right, just let me think about it for a little while, all right?
No.
Will, take my hand come out of the ghetto and take a stroll down Wall Street.
You see we buy stock in Westworld Airlines today for $2 a share.
And by Friday, it's worth $8.
Now, when you take a girl out to dinner, they can get something to eat, too.
So then they'll owe me something!
I'm with you!
Here's my $20.
- I thought you said it was illegal.
- It is.
God, how I love life on the edge.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
Carlton, honey, would you drop my bracelet off at the jeweler's?
- The clasp broke.
- Sure.
- Those almost look like real diamonds.
- They are, so be careful.
Hello there, Agnes.
My, that's a lovely tattoo.
You know, the knife dripping blood really sets off your eyes.
I did it myself.
So what you got?
We have this lovely, expensive bracelet.
$200.
For an ordinary bracelet but not okay for one that formerly belonged to Catherine the Great.
The one-armed chick that works the corner of Hollywood and Vine?
She a class act.
Okay, $300.
Did we mention that it ain't stolen?
Okay, $400.
But that's only 'cause I think your short friend here is kind of cute.
Hey, small stuff you wanna come back here and check out the rest of my merchandise?
This is a delicious meal, Geoffrey.
You've outdone yourself.
You're too kind, sir.
Moron!
Fathead!
Geoffrey, must you listen to the Dodgers game during dinner?
I'm terribly sorry, madam.
But it is the bottom of the ninth, bases are loaded.
However, I will maintain my professionalism.
Bunt, you pasty-faced sod!
Peas?
Mom, have I told you that every year you grow even more youthful?
You're going to be well into your 40s before you need plastic surgery.
No, you cannot have the Diamond League over for lunch.
Daddy, you promised you would reason with her.
Honey, I don't know why you want to join that organization anyway.
Baby, it was different when I joined.
Today, all those women care about are cars, men, and money.
Well, what's wrong with that, sweetheart?
Men with money can drive her away in their cars.
Come on, it's just a little lunch.
You never got me a pony.
Geoffrey, start buffing the silver.
What the hell's your problem?
You got bricks in your butt, you clown?
Right away, madam.
Today's big story is the rumor of Westworld Air's imminent takeover which has caused its shares to skyrocket.
Your milk, Master Carlton.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
How's our stock doing?
Up 300%.
And might I add Hey, man, you know what I'm gonna do with my share of the money?
I'm gonna go out and get my very own team.
It's between the Raiderettes and the Laker Girls.
You can't buy love, Will.
Man, what you talking about?
I don't want love.
I just want them to follow me around saying, "Go, Will.
Get busy.
"Put your thing down".
Here's a Wall Street update.
The SEC has suspended trading of Westworld Air pending an announcement.
Come on, Carlton, translate.
How can I put this in terms he'll understand?
More money.
Man, I'm gonna get me the best girlfriend money can buy.
Come on, man, you gotta think investment.
See, I'm gonna go out and get me a Burger King, right?
And then I'm gonna hire some topless counter girls and then I'm gonna really have it my way.
This just in: Westworld Airlines has just filed for a Chapter 11.
Carlton?
Yes, Will?
That ain't a good thing, is it?
No, Will.
- We're in trouble, ain't we?
- Yes, Will.
We just lost everything.
Oh, my God!
How're we gonna get Mom's bracelet back?
- Come on, man.
Don't panic.
- Too late.
Dad knows.
No Harvard.
Dead end.
"Paper or plastic"?
Look, come on, just relax.
We'll just go get well-paying jobs very well-paying jobs.
$24, $25.
Gosh.
Who'd have thought they'd pay you so little for selling your blood?
- How do you feel, Will?
- I'm fine.
Buck up.
You only have to give blood 50 more times to get Mom's bracelet back.
There's gotta be an easier way, man.
If I could just get them classifieds.
You're not gonna hit me with this, are you?
I'd like to.
But I see three of you, and I don't know which one to hit.
Face it, Will.
You're not gonna find a job in there.
What are you qualified to do besides flirt with women and dance to loud, primitive music?
"Male strippers wanted".
Bingo.
Will, tell me you're joking.
Even you, with your depraved, working-class morality wouldn't stoop so low.
"Earn up to $500 a night".
Shake that groove thing.
So, did you get the stripper job or not?
Does David Duke shop white sales?
They said I was a natural, man.
They're gonna call me with my first gig.
Hold up, Will.
Granted, we're desperate for money but maybe you should stop and think of what kind of life you'd be leading.
Yeah, you're right, C. Dancing around in some cheap club while women put dollars down my underpants.
I love this country.
My financial advisors have arrived.
Moron!
Fathead!
- I didn't know the Dodgers were playing.
- They're not, thieving wankers.
So, I think I should ask for my money back.
I mean, I've been in this weight-loss program six whole months and look at me.
I'm Shamu.
Philip, I thought you had an important business lunch.
Nothing is more important than our little bachelorette.
Mrs. DeWynter!
So nice to see you again.
Thank you.
So, what do you think of our little Hilary?
She's going to make some man a wonderful wife one day.
Soon, I hope.
Well, I think I speak for all of us leaguers when I say, "Isn't she lovely"?
Yes.
Vivian, I do hope you will bring Hilary to our new members' dinner.
- I'm sorry - Well, I think I can speak for Vivian - when I say, "She'll be there".
- Philip In her brand new BMW.
See you there.
Ashley, sweetie, we are going to the Diamond League dinner at the Gingham Turtle restaurant.
Here's the address and phone number in case there's an emergency.
Okay?
Mom, I'm 13 years old.
I can take care of myself.
That's what Drew Barrymore said.
Banks residence.
No, Master William's not home, thank God.
May I take a message?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I'll see that he gets it.
Bye.
- Master Will.
- Hey, G. The Boogie Buns Agency called.
It appears you have a job this evening.
Bad!
My first gig.
Hey, where is it?
- The address is on the counter.
- All right.
And they also requested that you bring a spare G-string.
There's an explanation for that, G. Yo, Carlton, I got a gig, man.
We're home free.
We'll get Aunt Viv's bracelet out of hock.
She'll never know the difference.
- You mean we're saved?
- You got it.
Hey, I picked my costume up today.
See, I figure I'll start out in this.
And I figure I'll end up in this.
I gotta go iron this stuff.
Get the address for me.
It's right over there on the counter.
Gingham Turtle restaurant.
Sounds pretty sleazy.
Yo, this ain't exactly what I expected.
Check out the lowlife.
Yes?
- Yeah, man, I'm here for the gig.
- You?
You are here to perform for the ladies?
- That's right.
- Of course you are.
I'm serious, where are the other guys at?
I gotta get changed.
Other guys?
Yeah, when I auditioned they said I'd be second on the bill.
Between King Thong and Rambro.
I'm sorry, monsieur.
There is no one on the bill but you.
Ladies, I'm told the entertainment has arrived.
It's my pleasure to introduce the international star Sir Graham Higgins, doing a medley of operatic favorites.
Mom, which opera is this?
Will shake something, damn it!
Take it off!
Take it all off!
Take it off!
Put it on!
Carlton Banks, you put your clothes on this minute!
Mommy.
No dates, no charge cards, no television, no movies, no phone calls no food!
Sir, permission to beg, sir.
What?
I'm deeply, deeply sorry about the unfortunate stripping incident.
- I just wanna say it's all his fault.
- What?
Look, come on, Uncle Phil.
I mean, I'm sure you did something like this when you were a kid.
Maybe not.
I think you two owe Hilary an apology.
Your behavior tonight cost her an invitation to join the Diamond League and meet some nice young men and you know how much that meant to me.
I mean, her.
It's okay, Daddy.
The more time I spent with those women the more I realized they're not my kind of people.
I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Honey, I am so proud of you.
Mrs. DeWynter.
Hilary, darling.
Why did you run off like that?
I wanted to invite you to join the Diamond League.
I'd love to!
Switching entertainment like that.
What an outrageous idea.
Say, my mother's turning 90.
Are they available for birthday parties?
- I guess I'll just be - Sit.
I'm not through with you two yet.
I wanna know what excuse you have for pulling such a stupid stunt.
- We needed the money.
- For what?
And I want the truth.
All right, it's like this, Uncle Phil.
See, Carlton got this inside tip on a stock.
Federal offense.
Go on.
Well, then we pawned Aunt Viv's bracelet to get the money for the stock.
Grand larceny.
Impressive.
And then we lost the money so we had to strip to get the bracelet back.
That would be indecent exposure.
Is there more?
I'm afraid so, Dad.
We never got the clasp fixed on Mom's bracelet.
You never got the I don't know what to say.
We don't What can I do?
What do you boys think I should do?
I don't know.
Reward us for our honesty?
- Hey, it worked for the Beave.
- The Beave!
Do I look like a white guy named Ward?
Now, you get that bracelet back and for the next six weeks I don't want to hear you breathe.
Or I'm calling the Feds myself.
I guess this probably ain't the best time to tell him we ran over the mailbox.
Come on, man, what is wrong with you?
It's Agnes.
I can feel her undressing me with her eyes.
I don't think so, man.
She's not laughing.
Come on.
Go ahead.
Excuse me, Agnes.
But isn't that our bracelet?
Was your bracelet.
I'm only obligated to hold it for five days.
Today is the sixth.
But we have the $500.
Well, I'll give you $550.
Hold it now, hold it a sec.
Look, Agnes, could I speak to you for a second, please?
Could I speak to Agnes?
Hey, look, Agnes, slimmie, now, what's up?
How you gonna play me?
I thought we had an understanding, you know?
I mean, we speak the same language and all.
What's going on?
Babe, we ain't nothing going on but the rent.
- It's like that, right?
- Just like that.
$550 is what the lady's offering.
I hope it doesn't interfere with our relationship, Sweet 'N Low.
Please, we'll do anything.
What'll it take to change your mind?
What you got?
No.
Work it, honey.
- Hey, it worked for the Beave.
- Worked for the Beave!
Do I look like a white guy named Ward?
Now, I want you two to go down there and get that bracelet back and for the next six weeks I don't want to hear you breathe.
Or I'm diming you out to the Feds myself.
Congratulations, you just made the blooper reel.
