.
I'm back Hi God I missed you Ok, get in So how was the trip?
How was the guy?
What can I say?
It was hot, it was intense it was nice, it was comfortable it was boring, it was irritating it was over.
I couldn't stand him I'm sorry to hear that I was hoping you would fall in love - Oh, I did - Tell me Grace, I found the perfect pair of jeans I'm serious.
They're perfect They conceal from the world everything which is flawed and evil and show only that which is true and plump I've spent my entire life looking for a bra that'll do that How 'bout you?
How's Nathan?
Mmm In a word Bootylicious Oh, it's so good and the sex-- - He likes it, doesn't he?
- He does - Even though you're a girl - I know.
Crazy, isn't it?
And he does this thing-- Guys, bootylicious is in the room Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º The Third Wheel Gets the Grace ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸ 24 Å¬·´ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ - Morning, sweetness - Hey, precious Sorry, I thought you were Grace Well, hold that thought Well Hold that robe closed So, you don't happen to know where she is?
Oh, breakfast with her boyfriend Will Right now, they're probably doing that real cutesy thing where they nibble on a piece of bacon until they meet in the middle "I missed you.
I love you I missed you, too".
Anyway, I think that's where they're at Oh, I get it.
I'm supposed to be threatened by her friendship with Will Well, I think it's great I've tried to have women friends but they always end up pregnant I jest Well, you're a bigger man than I Of course, I jest, too Well It's good but it's not as good the-- - That place off the Rue de la-- - Yeah, I know Something about the way they-- Yeah, and is the guy still there?
Oh, the guy that-- Spoke like this?
That was good I am telling you, Nate they're joined at the unhip Morning, sweetie Your thoughtful girlfriend brought you a turkey and cheese croissant I'm a vegetarian Which is why your thoughtful girlfriend ate it Oh, oh, yeah, ok, no What you two do behind closed doors is your business, ok but flaunting that lifestyle like you're doing right now is just plain ge-ross We're not gonna hide who we are, ok?
I mean, we date we're straight, get used to it Well?
What do you think?
Nice Do they sell men's clothes where you got those?
You don't know anything These are fantastic French jeans And by the way, what happened to "welcome home, Will"?
Hmm Welcome home, Will How 'bout the fact that since you last saw me I have fathered a 12-year-old boy Yeah While you were out of the country discovering the gay jean I was here raising my son Would it have killed you to acknowledge that the boy exists or were you too busy high-kicking it with Nicky Kidman at the Moulin Rouge?
What are you talking about?
I sent Elliot French comic books video games you can't get in the U.S. at least six pounds of chocolate Those were for him?
Yes And a t-shirt that said "Paris" on it You mean this?
How inappropriate to buy a 12-year-old boy a belly shirt It would have fit him Well, don't you have the answer for everything, Mr. French Welcome back Later on, let's catch a sad movie with a gay undercurrent - I love those jeans - Thank you I wore them to my bat-mitzvah after party What are you doing here, anyway?
Don't you remember what today is?
Yeah.
It's national Scrub Your Toilet day and I think you should get home and start celebrating!

No Something he needs Like back-to-school clothes I wonder what the kids are wearing these days Probably not leg warmers and jazz pants, like when I was a kid Well, hey, I've got an idea I'm going to the Barney's sale with Rosario this weekend Why don't you just come along?
Well I'll need a little money from the ATM Denied Denied Approved - Hey, where's my best girl?
- Here I am!
I meant Grace I'm supposed to take her to lunch Your girlfriend's gone She went to lunch with her husband That is ridiculous I mean, I wake up the other night and there's a third person in bed with us Can you imagine that?
Ok, wrong question I mean, I'm her boyfriend and she keeps canceling on me How would you like it if the person you were seeing kept blowing you off?
Again, wrong question Nathan, why are you so upset?
Well, I'm sick of feeling like the third wheel I-I'm tired of this arrangement What--what arrangement?
You two Your whole little thing with the "why" and the "huh" and the "no" but the "yeah" but the "I".
It's enough already Ok, look, I-- I think I-- I think I know what you're talking about Nathan, I am so, so sorry Look, we're doing it again It's just like the time that-- I know, and if you recall, after Danny - you promised-- - Well, not so much as a promise-- Stop it!
I know Will's your friend but I'm your boyfriend And I want a special restaurant with you Fine I want a secret language with you / Fine And I want to go to that Barney's sale with you Ooh What?

Hi Did you get those jeans here?
Oh, actually, I got 'em in France Really?
They're great I would love to get a pair - Well, they're men's jeans - Heh heh.
Well, if you say so You and I, we have to stay focused You know how sharks are eating machines?

/ A little What?
What?
Did you really just say that?
Don't you want to look a little fatter?
Try again Uh Well you're very skinny, Grace Well, Nathan, what are you saying?
Am I fat or am I skinny?
Um, I I'm afraid to go on - 150!

Oh, all right Look come here Come over to the mirror.
All of you You see?
Everything about them indicates "men's jeans".
The way they ride low on the hip the thoughtful flare athe shoe the handmade copper ingots and look, there's a little secret compartment in here for your thumb or a a tube of lipstick Do I hear 160?
No, no.
they're a little Sex and the City Maybe I should look at the boots What are you talk-- They're fine They almost make your calves and your ankles look like two separate entities Maybe I should get a coat instead Or a blouse - You want to get lunch and come back?
- Oh, for God's sake, just pick something I have been standing around here all day with these low-end discount-shopping freaks Oh, not you, honey You're perfection But I'd rethink the yellow It's making you look a little "hepi b." Now, listen to me I'm not standing around here for one more minute while you-- Oh, lady, put a cork in that whine I'm trying to make a decision What is going on with you?
You've never had a hard time spending my money before - You want the truth?
- Not if it's long What if I said I didn't want any of these things?
I'd say you were crazy What if I said I've just been stalling so I could spend more time with you?
I'd say you were a lesbian What if I said that's all I wanted for our anniversary?
I'd say you were a crazy lesbian Well, it's the truth That's all I wanted Wh-- You-- You wanted to be with me because you like me?
OK.
This is getting a little bit too real Here, buy anything you want I gotta get out of here I can't breathe Karen?

Well, yeah, the kids at your school would kill for this look That's what I'm afraid of-- I will be killed What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
I look like Ricky Martin So you do like it Oh, that's a bad thing I'm sorry Well, that's all right If you don't like it we can get something else Go change / Ok I just think wearing leather pants to P.E. would be a mistake Then, why did you say you liked it when I picked it out for you?
Well, you seemed so excited about them and.
What?
I just wanted you to like me Well, you don't have to get these clothes for me to like you, Elliot I do like you We're--we're good - We are?

He used to dump Will in the cafeteria garbage can if he didn't do his homework Well, I, too was bullied as a child I went through a lot but I'm proud to say no one ever forced me to do their homework That was probably because they never assigned a history paper on the rise of the leg warmer Yeah, I went to a crappy school Will, I can't believe how casual you're being about this I mean, this is the guy who changed the name on your locker from "Will Truman" to "Will Woman".
Wow, that's brill The best I ever came up with was "Will Trumpetman".

My son Elliot is on the phone asking a girl out for the very first time ever Ohhsomeone's a proud papa Oh, I remember the first time I asked a girl out Well, not a girl so much as my cousin Robert I remember calling girls for dates I was so nervous, you know that they might say yes - Hi - Hey!
- What happened?
- How'd it go?
Randy Varner already asked her to the dance so she's going with him - Sorry, Elliot - At least you tried That little tartlet!
You know, Elliot, if this girl turned you down it just means that there's an even better girl out there for you and now you'll find her You're young enough to buy that, aren't you?
I'm going to finish my homework Hey.
Hey, you know maybe later if you're not doing anything we could do something together, you know?
Like, um wave at sailors I think he means baseball Baseball.
Sure Fun.
Great.
Yeah Poor kid I can't believe she turned him down Just make sure you do something fun with him that night Like when I'd stay home from a dance my mom and I would bake ginger snaps and watch "Little House on the Prairie".

You got me as a parent That's like saying Chastity Bono can't wear Bob Mackey So I guess somehow it got out that I like to French Anyway, we're on the dance floor and we're at that part of "Bette Davis Eyes" where Kim Carnes starts to talk when suddenly his tongue comes at me like the shark in Jaws By the way, Jaws 3D Dennis Quaid, no shirt-- worth the rental - So where was I?

My brother once flushed a turtle down the toilet and we had to get it out with a spatula That's what I'm talking about Men need to be programmed Am I the flattest one here?

But come on I mean, would actual feds be this ticklish?
For the last 11 months we've been conducting an investigation into Stanley Walker's financial affairs We've discovered several discrepancies which have led us to believe Please!
Sir, maybe we haven't impressed upon you the gravity of the situation I'm aware of the gravity, Agent Korn I mean, without gravity could my pants do this?
I'm allowed one phone call You don't mind if I make it with my ass?
Will!
Will Stan's been arrested Oh, for God's sake put your pants on You're my lawyer not my dentist!
All right, enough is enough I'm not buying it Honey, it's all over the news Oh, really?
Well, what is "Stanley Walker being taken into custody on charges of tax evasion" "Federal authorities apprehended Mr. Walker at his home in Manhattan" If you have any questions for Mrs. Walker you can address them to me Her attorney I screwed up Who am I kidding?
I'm no one's father Hey You embarrassed your kid at a school dance I think that makes you a father You know, I can remember this one time when my father chaperoned the Winter Sing And he dumped you No, he didn't dump me He was my father Although emotionally he did turn his back on me in college.
I was moving into my freshman dorm and we were going- Enough of the stories!
Write 'em down!

- Hey - Hi So, was that your dad?
Sort of Wow, he got up and danced in front of everyone You were great Yeah.

It is Zandra with a "Z," not Sondra with an "S," 'cause Sondra with an "S" goes "sss" not "zzz".
A student once made the mistake of calling her Sondra and she threw a lit cigarette at him Don't you mean Zigarette?
Look, kiddies, I'm being pummeled by my allergies, my back is in knots and I`ve got an underwire sticking right here in my left one So I am in no mood for B.S. Ronnie, light me, please Now Let's see Just one general note here "Your scenes last week horse crap".
So we're gonna have to go back to the basics In this exercise I want you to apologize- Apologize to someone that you've wronged And I don't want to catch anybody "acting".
Ok?
I just want to catch the truth Now you, Summers, you're up Mom I'm not quite sure how to say this but I'm sorry Oh, God, I'm sorry!
Is she ok?

- M-my apology - To who?
- My father?
- I don't buy it Ok, it--it-- It wasn't my father It was somebody else that I really wronged I don't believe you Ok, I wasn't thinking about anybody Well, what were you thinking about?
Food - What kind?
- An egg salad sandwich - You liar!
- Ok, it was tuna!
Poor guy He's not very in touch with his instrument Oh, but he is He can even dial a phone with it honey, you scared me I thought you were my clone but none of them survived Hey, Kar Hey, aren't you supposed to be at work, 'cause I know I am Oh, how am I supposed to leave you?
I mean, look at you You're a wreck Oh, well, actually, honey I'm feeling much better Yeah, I just talked to Stan He had a good day in prison today He and a convicted junk bond trader smuggled a glazed ham out of the kitchen So, honey, if you want to leave I know you've got things to do I mean, there's fashion mistakes to be made andit's probably happy hour at some gay bar Oh, and also You know what?
I'm not gonna leave you Not this apartment or this tub until I know that you are totally whole But.
Not another word You know what?
I'm getting a little chill so could you close the door, please?
From the other side How sorry am I?
"S" is for how very sad you make me feel "O" is for, oh how very bad you make me feel "R" is for how wrong you make me feel And the other "R" is for how rotten you are Get off Get off the stage!
I don't want to even look at you anymore Sorry, Zandra I don't even believe that Ok, new person you're up Oh, I'm just observing Life isn't there for us to observe It's there for us to live - Oh, really, I-Oh, but - Up!
The thing is, when there's a camera on me I just get-- Oy, boy Uh, I--I can't Do it now Go Hi I haven't done a lot of acting before Actually, that's not true I--I-- For 19 years I played the role of a heterosexual My guess is not very convincingly Now apologize to someone you've wronged Ok, let's see uh I'm sorry Someone that you've treated unfairly Just think about the pain you've caused and tell that person you're sorry I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've been so hard on you I'm sorry I expect so much from you Who are you talking to?
Myself It's just that I make you feel that you have to be so perfect for everybody else I set you up for failure No wonder you're afraid Please forgive me, I beg of you please, forgive me.
I love you I love you Will Truman, I love you!
I want to work with you privately I don't know what to do I mean, Grace is my friend and it's not that I don't appreciate what she's done but enough is enough I know, mommy She's driving me up a wall She sleeps late She's insulting to the staff She's turning into one of those mean abusive rich people She should be punched in the neck hey That's not very lady-like - With an open fist - There's my girl What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute I've got an idea We'll come up with a big fancy plan with lots of twists and turns to make her understand what she's done I'll hide somewhere and you'll wear big shoes Or we could go simpler Thanks, honey!
You're a good friend!
"And I have to believe if there's any justice in this world "Stanley Walker will soon be a free man".
I'm so real "Stanley Walker will soon be a free man".
Every time I watch it I find a new layer - Wanna watch it again?
- No.
Turn it off - Hand me that blanket - You get it You know, if we were at Karen's right now there would be somebody to do this for me This place is a dump.

It's kinda difficult with you yammering on Rude!
- Outta there!
Go on!
Beat it!
- Ooh!
/ Ooh!
I like that What's the matter with you?
You can't spy on people when they're mating This isn't Animal Planet God!
You people are so unethical!
- You're the one who's unethical, Will - Oh, I'm unethical Thank you At least you admit it I'm not admitting it I'm being incredulous Isn't that just another word for unethical?
Look, spying on Grace and Nathan while they're in flagranteheterosis That's unethical It's like lying or stealing It's like wearing a brown belt with black shoes - Now you've gone too far!
- I resent that!
Listen, there is nothing wrong with us listening to Nathan and Grace have sex It's a victimless crime It's like tax evasion or public indecency Yeah, or like when a bartender doesn't notice his tip you can slide it in front of you and leave it as your own Oh, great example, honey!
You are so quick!
Lightning!
Whhssshh!
That's a terrible example!
Ooh.
I think somebody's just mad because somebody didn't think of it first What am I doing?
I'd have better luck explaining ethics to Angelina and Billy Bob Hey!
Grace would agree with us Let's go in and ask her You're not going in there!
Oh, why not?
It's not like there's anything that interesting going on - Get out!
Go on, beat it!
- Ooh!
/ Hey!

Will & Grace Rules of Engagement ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸ 24 Å¬·´ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace Season 4 Grace.
Grace, wait I cannot believe that you just did that Do you have any idea how inappropriate that was?
Grace, it's supposed to be inappropriate That's why they call it "sex".
What's--what's going on?
- I asked Grace to marry me - You-- Oh, my god!
Oh, tell us everything!
How did he do it?

How did she do it?
Did she get down on one knee?
Ok, out!
Out!
Everyone out!
Go to your own apartment, please We'll have have little privacy Ha.
Jeez Those guys It's like they don't have their own lives - Get out!
- All right!
I can't believe you did thatlike that while we were doing that Why?
Was it not a happy time for both of us?
It was a happy time for you It was on the way to a happy time for me Just blurting it out like that I mean, did you even mean it?
Sure Why not?
That's not an answer That's what you say to the free sample lady when she asks "do you wanna try bacon in a tube"?
Come on, Grace Sue a guy for being spontaneous Nathan, there is a difference between being spontaneous and turning a marriage proposal into a Penthouse letter I don't even know what that means Ok, I do know what that means but rest assured, I would never use your real name Look, it's just not how I ever imagined being proposed to, ok?
I'm supposed to be holding a bouquet of wildflowers not my own ankles!
Ok.
I get it I'm sorry.
I Just we've never been big on proposals in my family When my dad asked my mom it wasn't so much "Will you marry me," as "Well, I guess now we gotta get married".
Anyway, now that it's out there huh huh you wanna?
I'm not ready to answer that question - So no - No - No.
Yes?
- Yes - Not now?
- No.
Yes!
- No?
- No.
Yes.
I don't know!
Just take it back Could you just take the question off the table?
Fine I take it back Thank you We'll just pretend like it never happened I understand So it's off the table Right Never happened - What never happened?
- The proposal!
Look, we haven't been talking much, so, uh No, no, no, no, no We're not gonna talk about that Talk about what?
The thing we said we weren't gonna talk about I wasn't gonna talk about that Oh what were you gonna talk about?
I lied I was gonna talk about that - But now I won't - Good 'Cause there are plenty of other things for us to talk about Ugh I just had another uncomfortable evening with Nathan It's just-- It's horrible I mean, ever since he proposed there's been nothing but weirdness but he should not have asked me like that, right?
!
No/ No/ Of course not!
The fact is, there's a right way and a wrong way to propose to someone and that was the wrong way I did the right thing Totally/ Of course you did!
/ Totally Oh, my God, I did the wrong thing Totally/ Of course you did!
/ Totally I have made a complete mess out of a really great thing!
What am I gonna do?
- I don't know - What should she do?
Come on, give me something!
I need some help here!
Will, what should I do?
Grace, what if he asked you the right way?
What?
What if he had asked you the right way Would you have said yes?
I don't know I I I think I would have Whoa So that's great Yeah, it is No, it's not!
I made him take it off the table Now he's never gonna ask me again - So, ask him - No, no.
No That's not the way it's supposed to happen I want him to ask me Grace, in the real world women ask men all the time Rhoda asked Joe  - No, she didn't - Yes, she did She kept waiting for him to pop the question and when he finally did, it was "Do you wanna live together"?
So she looked him right in the eye and said "Ok, Joe.
I wanna be married".
Wow.
You will use any excuse to do a Rhoda impression Grace, you love him You wanna marry him So ask him You're right I should.
I will!
I'm gonna ask him I mean, it makes total sense I was the one who was gonna end up paying for the ring anyway - Oh, my God!
This is so exciting!
- I know!
I gotta call my sister Brenda and tell her the news  No, no, no, mom I'm just saying I wanna make sure you and dad are gonna be home tonight 'cause I may call later with some big news Ok, how does your mind go to colitis?

Oh!
Uh, ok Uh, let's go Ok, Nathan's right behind me What's wrong?

I'd say it was the day she became a gay man and fell in love with you Ok I'm going down to the market pick up some doughnuts and dental floss Ok, "doughnuts and dental floss".
Why don't you just make an announcement?
"I'm sleeping alone tonight".

Grace Are you sleeping?
I was Well, now that you're up Hi!
Jack, I--I really wanted to be by myself I know Me, too Anyway you know, sometimes my mom would take to her bed for weeks and I was the only one who could help She'd say "Jackie, sing me a song" and I would She'd say "Cuddle with me, Jackie" and I would I do believe that that may have been the root of me becoming an entertainer Either that or it was the root of you becoming a big 'mo You're funny when you're devastated Anyway, I find that the one thing that really makes people smile is my music Or my oddly long tongue your choice - Music - Good!
Grace, I finally figured out how to make Jack 2001 different than Jack 2000 You're gonna get an audience?

If you don't I'll have to call your mom Good girl Like I'd give these puppies up Well, it's gotten worse She's under the bed bumming out the boogeyman Who you calling?

Good idea!
She can scrub the hurt and anger out of Grace's knits and fine washables Finally, you're here!
You know, if you're gonna leave me in the limo for five hours the least you could do is crack a window What, and let you start yapping out at all the other maids so that they can come over and jump on the car?

You're right I've deluded myself this whole time into thinking that I'm ok, but the truth is I haven't been able to have a good relationship since Michael Maybe you're right to stay in bed and deal with it.
I mean Maybe I'm the one who got out of bed too early Honey You were right I don't know when Stan's coming back I mean, for all I know it could be years I gotta stop lying to myself, Grace I'm really lonely I I miss him When you said I'm an actor-singer who jumps from one relationship to another it made me realize You didn't say dancer And I've always felt in my heart that the dance is my strong point That's so depressing This is me doing a split jump on the trampoline.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- Will!
- Ah!
Don't do that!
You're like a gay Jack-in-the-box  I'm up for the part of "Male Corpse on Slab".
I don't know what that means but "wear a condom" seems like an appropriate response Ah!
Wait!
Hey, hey, hey I'm auditioning for "Six Feet Under".
You know, that new show by the acclaimed screenwriter Alan Ball?
Tehh ball  The corpse is like, in three scenes and it's the glue that holds the whole story together Well, for what it's worth I've seen you act and I feel totally confident that you have the emotional range to play a dead man Thank you Pssst!
I'm enjoying your blouse today You know, Sarah Michelle Gellar is really smart I mean, at the beginning of this interview she's just talkin' about stuff like where she gets her highlights but then she starts in on foreign affairs and campaign finance reform I'm gonna say it She's a genius Let me see that Hmm Interesting Yeah.
See?
these pages are stuck together You've been reading an interview with John McCain  Here's the rest of Sarah Michelle "And even after all these years limos are way cool".
Yeah.
I probably should've figured it out when she started talking about her time in a P.O.W. camp Ooh, uh, before I forget I need you to write me a check There's this guy, Ted Bowers He's running for city council I really think we should support him Well, what do we know about him?
He's gay - And?
- And he's gay But what's he for?
I mean, you know, where does he stand on the issues?
What do you care?
You thought Buffy was in a prisoner of war camp  I'm just wondering what are his positions?
I don't know I think he's a top Come on Write a check already You should support gay men Gay men support you How much?
The limit's 500 Most people are giving, like, 250 Heh!
Well, I am not most people "100".
Give me a break I just gave 500 to the Paul Smith fabulous boot foundation Another important gay cause Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º  ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸ 24 Å¬·´ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace Season 4 Once again, I find myself in the horns of a dilemma Once again, the appropriate response seems to be: "wear a condom".
No Elliot and I were preparing a VIP guest list for the fanglamorous party I'm throwing when my episode airs You got the part?
No, um, not yet But..
Watch this Wow I feel like I'm looking through the eyes of every one of your lovers Thank you Anyway, Elliot doesn't want me to invite Karen He doesn't like her Can you believe it?
Kids today are so weird You know, when I was a kid we couldn't wait to hang out with the local insensitive drunk I run this by Karen, and it turns out she does not care for Elliot either Why?
He's polite.
He's sweet.
He's kind I think I just answered my own question I mean, what am I supposed to do?
What--?
Ok, I know.
I know I got it.
I got it I'm gonna stage a phony robbery Yeah.
I'm gonna tie 'em back-to-back in chairs until they're forced to get along and I'm gonna wear a stocking on my head Taupe Or maybe eggplant Doesn't matter, doesn't matter It doesn't matter.
I can decide later That's the fun part Why don't you just sit them down and talk it out?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh That could work, although Where do the panty-hose come in?
You can always just wear them under your slacks You are always one step ahead of me I hate that about you!
And I love that about you!
Hey, Mrs. Friedman how are things on the eighth floor?
I'm not talking to you, Grace Adler and you should be ashamed of yourself I swear, the elevator smelled like this before I got on I'm not talking about that I'm talking about your button I can't believe you're supporting that man Ted Bowers happens to be an excellent candidate Ptewey!
Your candidate sucks my rain boots Hey, I like Ted Bowers and he's gay and I think it's high time we had gay representation on the city council especially in a society that still undervalues the rights of gay people Fine.
Do what you want Me, I'm voting for the Jewish woman There's a Jewish woman running?
Rosario, where the hell are you?
Get your rump into the rumpus room and get rid of all this junk Lady, I told you the doctor said I shouldn't lift anything I've pulled a muscle Oh, honey, I'm sorry I keep forgetting you're laid up Can I get you anything?
Wellactually I could use a bowl of sou-- Hey, Kare what you doin' in the play room?
Oh.
Hi, honey Since Stan's in the clink and the stepkids are spendin' most of their time with first wife I decided to turn it into something useful you know, like a laboratory or an Indian casino Oh, wow, you got an X-Box!
Hey, hey, hey!
Just because my husband's in prison does not mean you can talk dirty to me What the hell is he doin' here anyway?
He is here because I cannot tolerate two of the most important people in my life not getting along Now, I will not have my family go the way of other showbiz families So the three of us are gonna stay in this room until you two can find a love for each other and nobody, but nobody is leaving until we get this done!
Oh, my God!
My corpse audition just got moved up!
I gotta run Listen, you two work it out - Remember, find the love!
- Hey!
Wh--!
Honey, I--!
Uh So, listen, I need a check What for?
Judy Green She's running for city council and I think we should support her But we're backing Ted Bowers Well, I found out a few things about him that makes me think I should support the other candidate Like what?
Like he's running against a woman So?
Who is she?
What do we know about her?
She's a woman - And?
- And she's Jewish - And?
- And she's a woman So what?
What are her positions?
I don't know.
She's Jewish She probably just lays there Come on Write the check!
I am not gonna write you a check That would just cancel out the check you wrote me I know That's why I've already stopped payment on mine Now, come on Make it payable to "Judy Green for City Council".
All right Is a zillion dollars enough?
Come on!
Women need a voice on the city council I mean, 50% of the population is women So, one could argue that They just don't know it yet Anyway, this is not about statistics This is about who has the better candidate Well, what makes you think that you have the better candidate?
Grace, he's gay Well, mine's a woman and Jewish That makes two victims to your one Since when are you so Jewish anyway?
You're about as Jewish as Melanie Griffith in A Stranger Among Us Well, you're about as gay as Tom Sellick in In and Out I am plenty gay When was the last time you had same-sex sex?
I'm choosy!
Ha!
You're straight!
Go watch a basketball game!
Yeah?
Well, you're barely a woman You pee standing up!
Hey!
There are a lot of diseases you can get from a toilet seat!
!
Our own?
!
Well, I never thought that I would hear this from you!
- You hate women!
- Well, you hate gays!
- My room - Whatever - Hey - Hi I'm sorry I said some harsh things before You know, like "you're not a woman".
My God, look at you you're all woman You're gorgeous you're hot, you're sexy When I look at you all I can think about is being with that Croatian guy from "ER".
Aw, sweetie You know, I said some pretty harsh things, too You are plenty gay If you were any gayer you'd be Elton John's fanny pack You don't have to say that No, I mean it Well, if I implied that you're anything less than a big Jew, I'm sorry Thank you Let's just agree to disagree support our candidates and just not make a big thing of it Agreed I knew you'd feel that way Which is why I know you'll have no problem with me having a little Ted Bowers neighborhood fund-raiser here?
Not at all In fact, I've already agreed to host a Judy Green fund-raiser here, too - Huh!
- Huh When's yours?
Tonight Change it No!
Stop it!
You stop!
Ok, so I guess we're supposed to talk about what bugs us about each other Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Ok, I'll go first Hmm.
Kinda pushy for a 5-year-old, aren't ya?
I'm 12 Huh.
So you lie about your age so that you can drink or?
This is what it is about you you're weird You're a weird woman And you kinda look like the demon who guards the tomb in "Tomb Raider".
Don't even try and flatter me, kid Ok, look, I'm not happy about this, either but Jack asked us to do it and he's important to both of us so I think we should at least try Ok, oh!
This is what really bugs me about you the way you talk You're honest you've got no agenda you're not manipulative It's like you're talkin' in code!
Ok, well, how do you want me to talk?
Oh, honey, I don't care Just quit bein' such a goody two shoes - I am not a goody two shoes - Oh, yeah?
Don't drink, don't smoke what do ya do?
I am bad I'm bad news Come on, two shoes!
You've never done a bad thing in your whole life Oh, yeah?
Watch this - Pick that up!
- Sorry Two shoes Ok, well, how about this?
Sometimes when my mom's not home I make phoney phone calls They're rude and they inconvenience people What kind of phoney phone calls?
Well, once I called a butcher and asked if he had pig's feet He said, "Yeah," and I said "Must be hard to find shoes".
then I hung up Ahh You call that a phoney?
Boy, have you got a lot to learn Watch this, midget Hello?
Hello This is Nurse Bigrack from Dr. La-bop-duh-duhp-boop-boop's office Got good news for ya It's time to start your physical therapy What?
Why are you calling me so late?
Well, with that kind of an attitude we're not gonna get anywhere Now, let's start with some neck rolls Neck rolls?
The doctor said I should rest it Yeah?
Well, he changed his mind Start rollin' Ah!
Oh, that hurts Oh!
Especially when I do it to the right Oh, dear, I couldn't hear what you just said but it's better if you do them all to the right Ow-wee!
Ow-wee!
Oh Ow-wee!
Would you tell your people to stay away from the mini-quiches, ok?
I made them for my people God, quiche for a gay fund-raiser could you be any more stereotypical?
And, by the way, tell your people to stay away from my lox Would you look at that?
One of your women just drifted over to the fireplace which we clearly agreed was my area since the gay's need soft light Grace, this is a lovely party I guess the belly lox was too expensive, huh?
Still, people seem to be enjoying themselves I think we'll raise a lot of money here tonight Well, good I hope so You just hit everyone up It's the least that they can do And where's your check?
Well, what do you mean?
I'm throwing the party That's my contribution You know, there's an old Jewish expression-- "You're cheap and your husband's gay".
Mr. Zamir?
- Mr. Zamir?
!
- What?
What?
!
Happy Birthday!
Wait a minute You're supporting Ted Bowers?
Sure.
Ted.
Yes Yeah, but just a minute ago you were over on the Judy Green side Yes, but then they ran out of black-and-white cookies Who invited you, anyway?
I'm here to complain about the noise - Hey, Ted - Hi, Judy Well, this is quite the coincidence - He wouldn't cancel - She wouldn't cancel Stop doing that You stop!
Good evening, everybody A lot of candidates in this race wanna tell you that there's an easy solution to our city's problems Well, I'm here to tell you, there's not Was that not an applause line?
'Cause it felt like one For instance Homelessness Now, this is an awful, awful problem and one solution that I advocate is give them a hot meal Mm-hmm - Give them a shower - Uh-huh Put them on a bus and get them the hell out of our city A-- What?
So, in conclusion women in the home force those foreigners to speak our language and if God didn't want some people to be poor, he'd give them money He is very good And now Let's hear from a real candidate Ladies and gentlemen, Judy Green Thank you, Grace Let me start by saying how gratifying it is to see so many white faces here tonight Goh!
No, Marlo Why would I be kidding about that?
Phil is my father And I wouldn't be calling you except that he stopped making his child-support payments and my mom can't raise me on just a stripper's salary You are so amusing You can't laugh because when you laugh, I laugh I'm sorry, honey It's just that there ain't nothin' I enjoy more than yankin' Phil Donahue's chain And by chain of course, I mean Marlo Ahh, I'm hungry Can I have something to eat?

Well, I did a little something with the stuffing this year - This sort of aromatic - Oh, no.
Here it is Rosario, thanks for coming Look.

Let's get going and let's try to keep the eating to a minimum not spoil our appetites by gorging on everybody else's turkey and stuffing and pecan pie Why do you look at me when you say that?
Who should I be looking at?
Me Ok, I figure we each get one hour We'll set this timer and when it goes off We're out of there no matter what We do not respond to guilt shame, tears, or flattery Why do you look at me when you say that?
Who should I be looking at?
Me So, listen for the ding That loud, piercing high-pitched sound Why do you look at me when you say that?
We respond only to the ding because only the ding will set us free Understand?
Let's try it Well, this piece fell off already But if I get this knife this piece will come right off Ok.
Karen one hour I don't mean to rush you but if we're gonna get back in time for dinner we've all got to stick to the plan You gays and your discipline No wonder you all end up in the clergy Ok, Kar Let's go Oh, no.
That's ok, honey I'll go alone Besides, you're not really dressed for prison Too nice?
Sure, let's go with that Happy Thanksgiving Mr. Walker I brought you a turkey and if you look inside I hid a little surprise in there for you A chicken What's that, hon?
You miss the kids?
Ok.
Here they are Oh, you're welcome Mr. Walker Come on.
What?
Well, of course, Stanley You can talk to me about anything I hope you don't mind, Will I had some of your water I didn't have a water Not mine And Karen doesn't drink water Oh, my God!
Rental-car-stranger water!
Oh, my God!
How do I know this was water?
You know when boys go on road trips they don't make pee-stops They just use a water bottle Oh, my God!
Grace, don't you think you would've noticed if you were drinking pee?
There's still 40 minutes left on the timer What happened?
Oh, we were done There's really not much left to say after your husband tells you he wants you to start sleeping with other people That's intense I did it again!
He must be kidding What exactly did Stan say?
He said he wasn't sure how long he was gonna be in there and it wasn't fair to ask me to wait for him He wants me to be sexually satisfied while he's in prison I don't know why He certainly didn't care while he was out Maybe it's..
It's not called cheating if you have permission Yeah, maybe it's just called fantastic Well, it doesn't matter Even if, at this very moment his cellmate is tattooing "Property of Javier" on Stan's fat wide ass with a hot ballpoint I'm a one-man woman!
Woman?
I think you mean "lady".
Ok, listen We're getting close to Aunt Honey's so I need to brief you Whatever you do do not tell my mother that Nathan and I broke up You haven't told her?
You see how I went up at the end, like I cared?
Look, she always said that I was wasting my time with him and there's nothing she loves more than saying "I told you so".
She's so obnoxious She even has a little told-you-so dance Grace, you have an I-told-you-so dance Yeah, well but mine's cute Everyone thinks so Who's everyone?
Shouldn't you be looking for a parking space?
The only good news is that my mother's still depressed about not getting that part in Queen Lear so there's a chance she won't sing Am I blue?
Are these tears in my eyes tellin' you?
We'll back out real slow-like I don't think we've been spotted - Look who it is!
- Oh, hey!
- My Gracala.
Come here - Aunt Honey!
I have to kiss everybody twice like in France Hello, darling I'm very depressed We don't have to talk about it Ok Sorry we're late We had to walk a mile and a half from Will's parking space Uh, excuse me Will's kick-ass parking space Yeah.

Give me one I got a really bad back I guess these things can be used for pain So, how'd you hurt your back?
Runnin' away from good taste?
You got some mouth on you It so happens that I strained it during a round of passionate lovemaking with my super, Mr. Lopez I'm committing adultery and I had a cousin who was in a car accident When they opened him up can you guess what they found?
A smaller cousin?
What is that?
How could they find a smaller cousin inside my cousin?
I was really just I was just joking Why would you joke about such a thing?
I'm telling you a story about my cousin who was in a car accident He's dead now, in fact Still funny Mr. Jan Murray?
So, this super How good are we talkin' here?
Let's just say everything in the building is broken but I still call him "super".
I mean, there's really nothing stopping me My husband did give me permission Well, my husband gave me permission, too Ever since he spent our entire nest egg on a Toyota MR2 I tell ya, Jackie It's a rough business and 70% is luck of the draw God, that's so depressing I mean, you want to believe that sexual favors play some part in it I'll never be happy again It's over for me I may not even audition for The Ice Person Cometh Hey, Bobbi.

What are we doing?
Are we even working out?
Of course we are Just because we're not sweating doesn't mean we're not getting a good workout Just the kind of answer I'd expect from the owner of an Angela Lansbury workout video Ready?

Come on Up, up, up We're here to work out Let's go Let's stake it!
Let's what?
Stake it!
You gotta stake it Stop saying "stake it" What's stake it?
"Stake it" is my workout catch-phrase and in addition to being a motivational tool it is also a stylistic flourish that sets me apart It doesn't even mean anything Ok You two figure this out I'm gonna go work on my glutes Meaning you're gonna go sit at the juice bar?
Yep You can laugh at "stake it" now but when it becomes my "dyn-o-mite" or my "leggo my eggo" or my "hey, hey, hey" Then you'll be laughing,because Wait.
What Who's that guy?
That guy?
Um, I don't know He's that guy You know what's his name Generic McPlain Wrap No, I know him I just I mean not from the gym from someplace else Oh, who cares, Will?

Well, Grace Why don't you just ask me for the money?
I mean, come on I'd give you the loan in a second Really?
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure, honey All you have to do is ask Ok Karen, would you loan me the money?
Well, I'll have to see a presentation What?
Grace, I don't know what your business is I don't know what you do I mean For all I know, you could be using the money to buy Ms Pac-Man machines and pizza ovens Karen, this isn't Chuck E Cheese You know that I'm a designer All I know is there's a pizza here every day at noon I'm not gonna pitch myself to you It's insulting I would rather try and get a loan from a bank All right Well suit yourself Never gonna happen You know what?
I am gonna get that loan And not just because I'm a smart successful businesswoman who's run her own design firm for five years but also because I'll be wearing something see-through?
Here's my loan application some information about the business and my profit and loss statements for the past five years I think you'll be very impressed I know that I am Monday morning good for the presentation?

/Yeah Whenever you need that extra burst of energy all you have to say is -Stake it -Exactly What?
!
-Stake it!
-Hey, that's my phrase!
Hey!
So, I'll see you there tonight around 8:00 Great Will.
This is terrible This is horrible Did you see that guy that was just here?
We are going out tonight How great is that?
Someone has stolen "stake it" I was on the treadmill about to stake it and this personal trainer out of nowhere yells, "stake it"!
Do you want to hear about this guy I just met?
So I went up to her and I said I said "Excuse me I don't mind you using stake it but you do know that it's my catch phrase" And she said she's been saying "stake it" for years that her sister's ex-boyfriend invented "stake it" in Chicago in 1994 while working in a plastic factory!
But how can that be?
Ok, Jack I don't know what to say I'm outraged We are not gonna let her get away with this We are gonna slap such a lawsuit on her she won't know what hit her yeah, Thanks, Will Yeah either that or I'll pants you in public Let's go with that Hey, Curt, it's, uh it's me Will again I'm just calling again to, uh, to tell you what a great time I had the other night again Uh, still love to hear from you You got my home number my office, my pager, my cell Uh, I guess that's it Although my CB handle is Big Willie Oh, crap!
Hey, buddy I couldn't help overhearing Because I was standing here listening But these incessant phone calls have got to stop I mean, it's been a week Have some dignity Start stalking him Everything's fine He's probably just out of town or you're being blown off That is not possible We had a great time together A guy who is blowing you off does not go off the zone just to share a brioche pudding with you He went "off the zone" for you?
God, that line's older than "this is the first time I've ever done this with a man" No I'm telling you he's not blowing me off Hey, come on Let's go ask Marcy She knows all the gossip here I swear she's like a female version of Liz Smith Hey, girl, give me some spritz Anyway, listen, Marcy You know that guy that used to come in here around this time?
Is it Curt?
Oh, yeah I know Curt Yeah Well, my friend here Will went on a date with him about a week ago Oh, wow, are you the "Nibbler"?
I beg your pardon?
Well, I heard that the guy Curt went out with liked to nibble Yeah.
That I'm the nibbler He's working out in the afternoon now Did he say why?
Maybe he's avoiding you Nibbler Maybe you nibbled off a little more than you can chew Maybe you stop talking like that Maybe you'll tell me what happens if I don't Maybe I tell the management that wasn't a documentary you were shooting in the locker room Maybe I'll stop now So, Mrs Walker there you have it The business plan my mission statement and an essay on why I insist on keeping my hair this way So, in conclusion the Grace Adler Designs expansion project not only will benefit Grace Adler Designs but it will fulfill the dream of your friend Grace Adler Thank you Oh, honey That was a wonderful presentation I mean it Really A-Plus Whew Thanks Kar So, what do you say?

'Cause it feels like you've been avoiding me No, I haven't been avoiding you Look I gotta go I'll call you No Don't Don't do that Don't lie Not here This is a gym this is gay church Ok, look.
I've sort of been avoiding you To be honest, I just got out of a relationship and, you were kind of my rebound guy So, what?
You were using me?
Well, I wouldn't call it using you What would you call it?
Well, I don't know Sort of a gay catch- and-release program?
Sorry See ya Yeah, well, see if I nibble you again!
Your neck tastes like vinegar!
I'm guessing Will, I just heard what happened between you and Curt That was two seconds ago!
She's that good I guess what goes around comes around What are you talking about?
Well, Curt blew you off like you blew your guy off Oh, that is totally different He was a six and I'man idiot I'm sorry Are you bummed?
Yeah But are you Cuddle-bummed?
Come on, Karen I'm listening Why do you deserve to be out in the world among decent people?
Because Karen Walker helps people You know I was just a scared single mom working in a factory trying to put food on the table but when I heard about the barbaric conditions in our workplace I knew something had to be done I didn't even care how management was gonna brutalize me No I stood up on that table I rang that bell and I said "Union!
Union"!
"Union"!
Ok, I'm gonna have to stop you That's not you That's Norma Rae Come on, Gracie I know I have my flaws But--you, Grace you'rea kind person I mean, you wouldn't let a little kitty suffer much less a fellow human being, so come on, honey Let me out of here You're right I'm too soft-hearted to watch you suffer so I'm goin' to the movies Later -Mitchell?
-Uh, do I know you?
Come on It's Will Truman We went out once like four years ago Will Truman I seem to remember an answering machine by that name Look, I just I want to say I'm sorry You know we went out I never called you back Of course I remember you I cuddled your bum Well, why didn't you return my calls?
You know, I thought we had a good time I wasn't all that confident to begin with you know, and you made me feel like I was no better than a seven Oh, Mitchell Come on You are not a seven Look I'd just got out of a relationship and I was lonely I didn't think I could handle anything more than one night so I'm sorry Well, better late than never I suppose Will!
I got it!
Watch Stake it UK!
It's brilliant It's British I'm back So, how've you been?
Oh, pretty good after you and I had our thing I met someone, and, we've been together ever since Well, ok We broke up for a bit recently but, he had a fling with someone sent him running back to me Oh, good So, happy ending Yeah, Hey.

Wait You and The Nibbler?
Wait You and Clammy Hands?
Clammy Hands?
!
Hey!
Come on you guys Stake it UK!
So Have you thought of anything else to Hello?
Let go of my hair!
Not until you let me out of here!
Ok!
I will!
Psych!
I can't believe you fell for that!
You know, you can be really mean sometimes You were really mean to me putting me through that whole song and dance for nothing You hurt my feelings I was sparing your feelings Honey I looked over your proposal and I'm sorry but that dog just won't hunt You need to listen to me You know, I'm pretty good in business How do you think I got so rich?
You married someone rich!
You know nothing about business Oh, yeah?
Well, I know thatin today's uncertain economic climate people are taking a long hard look at any purchase that could be considered a luxury item eg, interior design Then, when you factor in the leading economic indicator ie winter housing starts the negligible impact of the recent interest rate cuts decline in occupancy rates in corporate office space it just seems to me that a smaller company Will be better equipped to respond to shifting market forces but I guess you probably already knew that I know where the market is Come on, honey That's why I didn't want to give you the loan It's better you stay small Lean mean and flat But, Kar, why didn't you just say all of this in the first place?
Because expanding this pizza parlor was your dream I didn't wanna just poo on that It's better that you just think I didn't give you the money 'cause I'm mean Oh, Karen That's sweet Now, come on Bust my bust outta here Thanks Now, come on Give me a hug Got you!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna give you a couple of hours to think about what you did to me

What's wrong with him?
Weird lip?
Monkey eye?
It's a new relationship It's very fragile It's like in 7th-grade science class, you know, when we had to grow that little bean in a cup?
I don't know I was still trying to grow breasts You'd wait for it to sprout, then you bring it out into the light, and it would grow into a great big bean stalk?
So what are you saying, Robert's a giant?
He's freakishly tall?
Are you having your stroke in installments?
Then-- Then what are you embarrassed about?

Yeah Let's have something light, ok?
Grace is cooking us pot roast tonight Ok, back up I know nothing of dinner with Grace You don't even know who Grace is, and you certainly don't want her pot roast It's like tire tread without the flavor Well, I called looking for you, she picked up and invited me over for dinner -Is that a problem?
-Yes!
Eh, uh, no It's just, like I thought we were doin' the bean thing, you know?
We're growing it in a small cup?
Yeah I never really understood what that was about I mean, God, what is it?

Oh, honey, you're a regular Leonardo You know, even with the extra LB's, he's still my favorite actor And I really think that this window is gonna be your Titanic Thank you, Karen So what can I do?
How can I help?
What are we drinking?
Well I was thinking you could be my assistant A designer's assistant?
Wow!
Oh, honey, that-- That's something I've always dreamed of doing Now, hold on, Karen If you're gonna be my assistant, it's not gonna be all boozing and cruising Well, maybe just a little bit Maybe a little bit Little bit Just a little bit Just a little bit But you're also gonna have to coordinate, facilitate, schedulate, ovulate-- Ooh!
Sounds like we've got a lot to do and not much time to do it in Say, why don't I help you by taking you to lunch at the Russian Tea Room?
Genius Ok, before you get mad at me-- I'm not mad Of course you are I found out about your secret lover by reading your secret day planner I invited him over I ruined your favorite sweater when I wore it to the gym Not my black V-neck!
Stay focused You're mad at me about Robert Go with it Grace, it's fine Once again, your inappropriateness has paved the way for a personal breakthrough So, really, why didn't you want me to meet Robert?
Hunchback?
Does he have fins?
I guess I was just afraid of what you might think And then I thought, I like him, you're gonna like him And even if you don't like him, it doesn't matter 'cause I like him Good 'Cause I was starting to think that maybe you were embarrassed by him or something No What would I have to be embarrassed about?
Hey, Will One second All I'm asking is that you don't judge I don't judge 'Cause the temptation will be to jump to conclusions Will, open the door Robert, this is Grace Sorry I'm doing The Nutcracker, and-- Oh!
You're a dancer What the hell is that supposed to mean?
!
He bends over any farther, there'll be chestnuts roastin' on an open fire - What's he doing?
- He's stretching, Grace What kind of a question is that?
What does it look like he's doing?
He looks like he's doing something that would render you unnecessary Oh, relax I like him Well, good I like him, too You like him I like him Everybody likes him Would you please knock off that stretching, Robert You're freaking Grace out Oh, sorry I didn't mean to make you guys uncomfortable You didn't If anything I'm jealous If I could do that, it would render a date unnecessary Oh!
Ha ha ha!
How embarrassing for you So I repeated the joke When you discovered "Hold me closer, Tony Danza," you rode that till the wheels fell off Grace, you look like you'd be a good dancer Oh Oh Heh heh!
Oh, no I am not blessed with the dance Oh, come on What are you talking about?
Everybody's a dancer Every movement we make is a dance We just have to find it Huh Oy Now, take a simple action, like clearing the table See?
You can find the dance in everything, even clearing a dish Wow Well, maybe next you can find the dance in doing my laundry Oh ho ho!
No one thinks you're funny You know, Will and I have a dance You do?
- No, we don't - Yes, we do!
Get your cute little butt over here, and let's show Grace the dance I taught you I really don't want to-- No, you have to I have to see it now Come on You're doing it, mister And five, six, seven, eight Ok, that's fine That's good We're done finding the dance We'll look in the morning when there's more light We may even find your sleeves - That was so-- - I said don't Ok Heh!
Will, I gotta go I guess I'll see you later Grace, it was great to meet you It was so great meeting you, Robert I'll walk you out Ok You just couldn't help yourself, could you?
What?
!
I already admitted I was a bad dancer!
You had to pick him apart!
You had to ruin it for me!
What?
What are you talking about?
How did I ruin it?
The minute he walked in the door, you were all like, "Oh, he's a dancer" He is a dancer I didn't know he was a dancer When I found out he was a dancer, I said, "Oh, you're a dancer" You didn't say, "Oh, you're a dancer" You said--you said, "Oh, you're a dancer" There's no difference Yes, there is!
One of them is riddled with judgment And you know very well, the minute one of us judges the other person's new person, it's over It's a sick fact, but it's true "Oh, you're a dancer" "Oh, you're a dancer" I see no difference Every time I look at him, I'll see your face hovering above, going, "Oh, he's a dancer" He is a dancer Oh, wow!
Now you are just throwing it in my face!
Will, I liked him Maybe you're the one who has a problem with him Is that possible Hecter Projector?
Don't you try turning this back on me when I am right in the middle of turning it on you You have never been more wrong, and to prove it to you, I'm going to keep seeing Robert I may even fall in love with him We'll move in together We'll have kids And through it all, Grace We will have the dance This better be important, Jack I was on the roof chain-smoking Ok, Dorleen, you know how you said you wanted something edgy?
Well, hold on to your yellow teeth because here it is The theme to my Barney's Christmas window is Somebody's been naughty Dorleen, this is Santa's ho ho ho What?
It's fabulous, right?
Oh, wait!
And for reindeer, we're gonna have eight little buff men in boxer briefs on all fours with antlers Can you see it?
Can you see it?
Do you bit!
Do your bit, Karen I've been on Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer, on Vixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, but not on Blitzen He likes to watch, ok?
!
And that's just the beginning Tomorrow I'm holding a casting session for the three not-so-wise but very hot men Ok, I'm gonna stop talking now You go You better be kidding me with this crap This isn't a window for Barney's New York, New York This is a window for the Fairies-who-are-going-to- get-their-eyes-scratched-out Store!
Now, you have 24 hours to get this right, or not only will I fire you, I will rehire you, pull your hair, and fire you again!
Oh hey, honey Wow, I love your new bag It's garbage Thank God you said it Phew!
Ok, listen to me I need you to do me a favor I, I need you to help Jack out with that window He's in a real pickle Jack wanted to do the job Let him do it Grace!
It's Christmas, for goodness sake Think about the baby Jesus Up in that tower lettin' his hair down so that the three wise men can climb up and spin the dreidel and see if there's six more weeks of winter Think about that Where'd you get that from?
The Bartender's Bible?
Forget it All right, honey I can't change your mind, I can see that, but, uh, we're still friends, right?
Come on Let's shake on it What is this?
Karen, keep your money Jack's on his own What are the holidays comin' to when you can't even bribe a friend to help a friend who screwed that friend over?
Santa, it's Jackie First of all, I just wanna say I'm sorry about the time when I was 11 and told Timmy Woods that you didn't exist I was just tryin' to make him cry so I could hug him But now I really need your help This Barney's window, it It's a disaster I guess I deserve it for screwin' my friend over But I'm really scared I'm gonna lose my job, so, Santa, if you help me, I promise I'll never ask for anything ever, ever, ever again, ever Amen Love Jack PS, um I know I just said that thing about never asking for anything ever, ever again, but, um, if you're feeling generous, I would like some leather pants, umhair extensions, and the ability to fly Heh heh!
Ok, donkey boy, it's your turn Let's see your window Um, uh, you know, wouldn't it be better to keep it covered up for a while?
I mean, very mysterioso, very curioso, very Rene Russo No But I need more time, please?
Please?
!
Quit begging you're acting like a homeless person If you don't shut up, I'll throw my hot coffee on you, too Babs, open window five So, did Grace say anything about me?
She liked you But you know what?
It doesn't matter what she thinks 'cause I like you I'm glad Oh, my God!
It's snowing!

Would you say hello to your-- your father's gassy stomach?
Sure, why not?
It always says hello to me Um, yeah, ok Well, I'll do what I can but they're gonna need to know the reason you're returning 'em That's easy As you may or may not know I'm having an affair The bastard broke my heart CDs were scratched Um, ok.

!
No, I don't, Will I've never been on a date with a woman before I don't know what I'm doing Ok, ok.
Well what did you do to win Joe over?
Well, I made him a beautiful accent pillow using a combination of the classic continental and brick stitch Oh, we're screwed - Ok, this will not work - Yes, it will It has to work Larry, listen, we gotta make Tina feel confident She has to see that there's other viable men out there Well-- But I don't know how to be romantic with a woman I got it Treat her like she's your mother What kind of sick stereotype is that?
!
Why would you even suggest that?
- Think about you and your mother - Treat her like she's your mother I'm only cutting half of this for you so you can take the other half home It'll make a nice sandwich tomorrow Oh, jeez Larry, you know, you really oughta hit the bathroom you know, before that stain sets - What stain?
- That one there Oh, my god!
How did I do that?
I'll be right back Do not let her order another glass of wine Where did you find this guy?
I know Look, we gotta be honest with you, Tina Larry was not the person that we were gonna set you up with Um The thing about Larry is that he's-- Wonderful!
What?
He notices everything about me He's completely honest He's sensitive, he needlepoints I love him!
And he loves you, too Ok, there he is, Trainer Now go make him pretty for the auction block - I'll go get the trailer - Ok Don't do this, Karen He may be gay but he's still our horse Nothing has changed Everything's changed What about my dream about a barn full of grandponies?
Come on This is all your fault You spoiled him the way you doted on him constantly brushing him French-braiding his tail putting clear polish on his hooves All I did was love him!
Go find Trainer and get him out of here!
I can't even look at him We gotta dump this pony before there's a pictureof him in The Enquirer having drinks with Liza Fine!
I'll go get his luggage and his clogs Come on Don't look at me like that It's nothing personal it's just you're not what I signed on for Ooh, soft Like washable suede My mind's already made up so you just might as-- Come on Noticing my couture Just like my little Jackie Oh, my god!
Honey, you're right This scarf doesn't go with this outfit at all What was I thinking?
?
Now, he needs to be brushed twice a day and he likes most music except Charlotte Church  He senses she's been deprived of a childhood by her fame-hungry parents Or I'll sell him to the highest bidder Let's go, Lamar Whoa, cowdaddy I've changed my mind Wh-what are you saying?
I can't do it, Jack I can't get rid of him I don't care who he sleeps with He's my boy, and I love him I love him I love my big, gay horse!
I want to go home Why, yes, Larry I'd love to show you my orchids They're out here on the balcony Actually, they thrive in winter - Wow, you and Larry - I know.
Me and Larry Ohh Being out with him tonight has certainly opened my eyes to the kind of men that are out there That's our Larry You know, he's secure he's confident One might even call him a man's man I mean, he is so gentle and attentive Yeah You probably couldn't say that about my dad, huh?
I don't want to talk abt your father tonight It's just gonna get me angry at him Go on, get angry I mean, right now he's probably in bed with his lawfully wedded wife Larry Larry, look at me You borrowed the coffee urn You owe us But when does it end?
One more hour and then you're done Is that too much to ask to save Will's parents' marriage?
- Well-- - Come on there's a pound of coffee in it for you And some really good yarn I'm listening Not only that your father's moody One minute he's-- he's soft and sweet to me and the next it's all cold and clipped "Gotta get goin'".
I wouldn't put up with it Do yourself a favor cut the guy loose I should He's inconsiderate he's cheap, and he's weak Ok And he can be so cruel I mean a real son of a bitch Now, wait a minute Well, what would you call someone who is incapable of love?
- He is not - He is!
He'll say whatever you want to hear just so he can get what he wants He doesn't care who gets hurt because he doesn't love anyone but himself!
Whoa, whoa, whoa Ok, stop No, he--he may be some of those things some of the time but let me tell you my dad-- When I was little and I got sick he would sit by my bedside the entire night to make sure the washcloth on my forehead stayed cool He got up every morning at 5:30 just to have juice with me before I went on my paper route And at 19 when I told dad I was gay he-- Well, he drove into a telephone pole, but That night he hugged me and said "you're my son".
That's all I know The man may have his faults but not being able to love isn't one of them You're right, Will George Truman is magnificent What?
Uh--uh-- But remember, he's mean Go ahead Tina?
Could I interest you in a moonlight walk and then perhaps a nightcap?
Oh, oh, Larry that's so sweet but I'm in love with another man Oh, thank God So am I I'll call you later to let you know that I got home safely He is lovely I can't put my finger on it but he seems more like your type, Grace

Mr. Stan, he suffers in prison You haven't been to visit him in weeks Oh, please The only one who suffers is the guy in the bunk underneath his waking up every morning with a mouthful of mattress 'Cause he's so fat If I've learned anything from the Dalai Lama by way of Richard Gere It's that suffering is a state of mind quite like heterosexuality or the Midwest You schmucks couldn't last three nights in prison Take away your freedom hell, take away your panty-hose you'd be crying like a baby Hey, that happened once and how dare you reveal secrets from our marriage bed?

Glenn and I are through Oh, Grace You were dumped by a prisoner I was not dumped It turns out he was two-timing me - That's awful - Thank you How could someone in prison get two dates?
I can't even get one Oh, this is all so embarrassing He seemed so honest and straightforward in the holding room Well Hopefully the next guy you meet will work a regular nine to five instead of serving five to ten Funny Maybe he'll have gone to Penn State instead of the state pen One more Maybe you two will live in a big house instead of the big house - And you're done - Ok, I--I warn you I may have one more in the morning Something about "behind bars" and "in bars".
I'm still workin' on it I'm sorry you're not gonna be able to try your case but don't worry You'll get another chance I'm still trying the case What?

I have to, I was invited If I don't go, it'll seem like I'm devastated because he's getting married before me - Which you are - Which I am but if I go as the sexy, independent carefree, ex-girlfriend in the fabulous cashmere camisole that makes me look booby and rich, then I win So this is just some sort of petty game to show up someone you don't even really care about anyway?
Yeah!
Then I'm on board Hey, what's new?
Oh, really?

But, uh, to give him a little credit I do remember our first Valentine's Day He gave me the greatest gift and it only took six to eight weeks to get rid of it I mean, what the hell were you thinkin'?
I come home from a double shift and I find "Jonny Quest" in my kitchen eating a baloney sandwich Hey, how about a thank you for taking your kid from bland to blond, huh?
Hmm, let's see Squeaky, rude, drunk You must be Karen Oh, sweet!
He faxed you my bio Listen, I don't mind Elliot hanging around with you, Jack but when he comes home with the gay haircut looking all downtown weird-- A-pa-ka-buku-shiki!
At least his hair says something now It says "Pow!

Hey, hey, hey, come on Before the hairpins start flying maybe I can help Now Roger, is it?
Bonnie Oh, pretty Listen, Bonnie I've got this maid Rosario been with me forever Now, I have had her stomach stapled her teeth fixed her hair dyed, she's been de-moled de-clawed, deloused-- What's your point?
Ohh, my point is I think I may have broken your spirit How would like to come work for me, ok?
Come on!
You know, if there were any justice in the world there'd be an alligator somewhere carrying you as a hand bag I like that Look, Jack, bottom line, ok?
I'm his mother I make the rules Well, here's a bottom line for your bottom line I'm his father and I get to make up some of the rules, too This is a big news flash for you You're not his father I'm his father, and his mother and until he was eight years old I was Santa freakin' Claus, all right?
You got no rights, Jack You're just a test tube that I picked up before they threw it away I'm sick of it I don't want you seeing my son anymore You know maybe there is an alligator running around somewhere with me as a handbag I mean, who knows what they do with my old skin.
Surprised to see you in a suit, Will I thought you'd be wearing your tennis skirt No one thinks you're funny Hey, you were funny last night Everybody's still talking about it Oh, please this weekend's not about me Everyone, you said?
It's all working-- The hair the clothes, the smile, the vibe The row of poppy seeds in your teeth from the bagel you had this morning What?
Aw, crap Excuse me you're the tennis player, right?
Oh, well, actually I-- Yes, I am - Hey - Hey What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to get away from Danny's mother Oh, yeah Or as I like to call her "What the hell are you doing in my apartment"?
You know, I probably-- I probably should've said this before Uh, but, um-- Um I'm really glad I'm here You know, I didn't know about it at first because, you know my whole history with Danny but, um, you know just seeing the two of you Seeing how happy you are It just It feels like Do you need some floss or something?
No, no, I think I can-- Just give me one more I got it, got it!
Well, I am really glad that you came here, too Really?
Thank you Yeah, I mean, that speech you gave last night?
- It was good, right?
- Yeah I mean, I mean, I did some stand-up in college so what was your favorite part?
All of it I mean you, you really have Danny nailed You know, how he's immature and how he's irresponsible and it's just really got me thinking-- Well, you know a good comic will do that You now, just get to the truth, you know Yeah, I'm calling off the wedding What?
Ok, when did I eat pineapple?
The toughest person I ever played Myself Yeah, when I'm on that court the only person that can beat me is me Did you ever play Steve Turner?
Steve?
I don't-- I don't know if I played Steve Probably Well, maybe he'll remember You know he's here, right?
Come on, Sarah open the door You want to marry Danny You have to marry Danny Why?
You didn't?
Hide me Everybody's about to find out I'm not a professional tennis player Big deal Because of my speech Sarah's decided not to marry Danny So what, your stand-up's now so bad it's breaking up marriages?
Why don't you keep your opinion to yourself, Venus?
Now get out of here I gotta convince her to marry him Ok, is there a window in here?
Does it smell like there's a window in here?
Oh, now, Grace-- There you are silly, he's here Steve!
Yeah, you know what?
You know when I said I was a professional tennis player that was because You know how you throw the word "professional" around like like Heather Graham is a "professional" actress?
Steve, this is Will He's a professional tennis player, too Well, I was-- Sure Will From the Davis Cup Yeah!
?
Yeah, Steve, isn't it?
From the Davis Cup?
Yeah Yeah, good to see you again Davis Cup When you coming home, son?
I don't know when but we won't get together then, Dad You know we won't have a good time then Hey, honey I think I've got something that'll make you feel better No, no, Karen No more sailors who think they're coming over for their physical Oh, boy Hey, how you doing?
I'll call you, or not Oh, my God, you're back!
How did you get his mom to agree to this?
I didn't I've been kidnapped Whoops!
Come on, Sarah you're about to make the most amazing commitment The only thing I've committed to lately is buying seven more CDs over the next 12 months and even that's giving me a stomachache Yeah, but all that stuff you said about Danny is true He's childish he's immature, he's-- I know, but he's a lot of other things, too He's a good guy He's a really good guy Yes, he may not go too deep into things But maybe that's ok because he let's me be the crazy one We can be in this huge crowd and he makes me feel like I am the only one there And there was this one time where I cut my hair really short I looked like the guy in Simply Red And I feltso bad And he came home and he said "I don't care You look beautiful, no matter what".
That was so sweet Daytime TV sucks Uh, what's going on?
Why aren't you at school why you with him and why haven't you turned into a bat?
I had nothing to do with this Elliot, Karen, I believe you have something you want to say to Bonnie Um, I got out of school early and went over to Jack's Elliot, how?
I signed him out I'm sorry, young lady you're gonna have to speak up I signed him out!
You kidnapped my kid?
It was his idea!
You drove!
Yeah, well, you're the one who wanted to see Jack!
Well, you're the one who bribed the attendance lady!
- Nya-nya-nya!
- Nya-nya-nya!
All right, stop it stop it, both of you!
Karen, so help me God I am two seconds away from not giving you a spanking Elliot, what were you thinking?
I wanted to see him I missed him, mom Go to your room Not you, him!
Go Good, that kid is trouble And you, go to your limo and think about what you've done - But-- - Limo!
Ohh!
Now, Jack, don't you remember a conversation we had where I said I didn't want you to see my kid or was the soundtrack of Evita blaring too loud in your head?
Hey, I wasn't part of any of this, ok?
They came to me, and the first thing I did was bring Elliot back here Are you wearing blush?
Ok, the second thing I did - was bring Elliot back here - Good The point is he's here and you'll never have to see me again so I'm just gonna take my gay self back to my gay apartment live my gay life and have a gay old time What are you doing what is that?
Oh, come on The whole thing about the gay haircut I know what's going on here The reason you reacted so strongly about the hair is because you have a problem with gay people - No, I don't - Yes, you do - No, I don't - Yes, you do!
- I'm gay, Jack - No, you're not!
- Yes, I am - No, you're not!
Yes, I am I'm gay Prove it!
Say something lesbianic Home Depot  k.d. lang, you are a lesbian!
Ka-pow Why didn't Elliot tell me?
Because Elliot doesn't know - You never told him?
- No, I never did And I think maybe that's why I overreacted about the hair I spent the last 12 years of my life trying to figure out how to tell my son I'm gay and you walk in and do it with a handshake I really want to be a part of his life, Bonnie And you should be, Jack But you gotta remember somethin', all right?
I'm in charge of his hair I'm in charge of no leather pants I'm in charge of telling him I'm gay my way, my time - Agreed - Good Wow Elliot has two gay parents That's like every kid's dream Let's hope so You know I can see why he likes you Listen, um Thanks for covering for me No problem So tell me, what's it-- what's it really like to be a professional tennis player?
How would I know?
I work for the IRS You ever tried saying that at a party?
It's like saying "hi, I just killed my family".
And there was one time When I couldn't get my car started And he called AAA and they started it I miss Danny!
I loved him so much!
Poor Grace, shh!
Oh, don't worry you'll be ok You'll find someone Not like Danny!

You are an impostor!
And I have a woman who he made out with who can be here in five minutes That'sright, five minutes because she has no life!
Damn!
Tell them the truth Ok.
I'm straight And it was wrong of me to deceieve you guys It's just that I love to sing I love to sing choral music It makes me feel like I'm Being gently chucked under the chin by God But there's no room for a straight man in that world You don't know how hard it is for me to fit in The looks, the murmurs behind my back I mean, I know what they're saying "Ooh, he likes girls".
So I tried to pass as gay It was wrong.
I'm sorry All I wanted was to sing and be accepted And maybe dance a little, too Cry all you want, straightie This is the gay men's chorus Who cares about choral music?
We just want to go to Europe and shower together And you can't come Yes, he can Confuse me?
We here at the chorus have a policy of tolerance We used to have a policy of openness but that got too many giggles You should be ashamed of yourself!
Congratulations, Owen You're going to Europe!
Don't change your hair And we're sharing a room You know You may have won but I still have my dignity I don't have to pretend to be anything other than who I am What do you have?
I have a free trip to Europe a huge per diem and a chance to sing in all the best venues in the world And a winning smile Perhaps But I still get to sleep with men

Ayleen?
I thought it was Eyleen It's spelled "Eyleen " It's pronounced "Ayleen" - Why?
- "A" don't know You know the more I think about it the more I hate it here The bathroom's too small There's not enough closet space My bedroom's filthy So, basically we're moving so you don't have to clean your room?
It's really messy You know the most annoying thing about living here?
Hello I swear I wasn't gonna say that We are here at the apartment that sex forgot to hear from two of Karen Walker's dearest, dearest, dearest Line?

We're here with the sad couple If you're just joining us we're digging into the mystery of Karen Walker We're going through her checkbook in an attempt to find out who she is Now, Grace right this way Thank you for coming On the18th Karen wrote you a check for $280 What does that mean to you?
She paid me $10 a day not to wear ruffles or eat Ruffles in the office Interesting, interesting Yet not so right this way Thank you, Will Thank you Ok And here, Karen wrote you a check a mere two days later for expense reimbursement I'm pretty sure only one of those is a word But what could that mean to you?
It was a, It was a guilt payment for throwing her credit card at my face Just as I thought This checkbook is unlocking the mystery of Karen Walker And I thought shooting those pornos for Tommy Lee was a tough gig Ok, This is just the first one We have a big day ahead of us What do you think?
It's charming, right?
I love it!
Are we done?
Well, I like the space great floors It's equidistant from my gym and Krispy Kreme does it have a view?
Does it have a view?

I'm guessing it's closer to Krispy Kreme's than the gym I love this building!
There's something about it It just feels so warm and friendly - Hey, neighbor - Hi!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Just so you know this one's been on the market a long time It's a lease option to buy and the seller's very motivated Don't look at him!

Well, I've been working my way through your checkbook trying to figure out who you are by how you spend Who is she?
Oh Well, honey, I think that's somebody driver ran over But usually, when Driver runs somebody over there's a little frowny face in the memo part of the check Yeah, well maybe it was one of those double-pedestrian dealios Who cares?

I'm her mother Santa Maria it has a mother?
!
I wish I'd never seen that place Now I can't stop thinking about it It was so great Not like this dump Come on This place is fine Oh, it's a dump, Will!
This is a beautiful apartment People would kill for a place like this It's got a doorman, a terrace It's in a great neighbor hood Damn it!
What idiot builds a step up to a kitchen?
!
This place sucks!
Crappy design!
Well, you'd better get used to it 'cause we're stuck in a shoebox until I'm an old maid in a threadbare cardigan and you're an old maid in a threadbare caftan Thanks You know the worst part about this apartment?
Oh my God!
You're not gonna believe what happened!
Honest to God I was not gonna say that I met Karen's mother She's not dead She's a cocktail waitress It turns out Karen's father died when she was seven.
Oh, my God Can you imagine what Karen looked like when she was seven years old?
Cute little pumps, cute little martini cute little pills Anyway, from then on they moved around a lot until Lois met a man a ne'er-do-well named Bernie Or was it Todd?
I don't know I can't remember 'cause at that point I zoned out 'cause some real hot fireman came into the bar Oh, his name was Todd That's right Hot Toddy Anyway, what did I do with his number?
Actually , when Karen was 16 her and her mother had some big falling-out and Lois wouldn't tell me what it was but I have a feeling Karen killed a man with her bare breasts All this is in my movie I smell sequel Karen has a mother?
Yeah, that's huge So, we've got to figure out how to get that apartment It's too much money Perhaps But not if we have more money My God, Grace You've done it That apartment is as good as ours - Oh, wait!
- What?
- No / Uh?
- Well / Yeah?
There is one thing we could do but it might make us bad people So let me ask you would you rather be good people in a bad apartment or bad people in a great apartment?
I think you know the answer to that We sublet We find somebody else to take this place Then we charge a lot more money than we should We gouge 'em!
You are brilliant!
Guys, open up!
Ellen has to pee - Hey - Hi Sorry we're late Traffic was ridiculous Well, maybe if you had taken the tunnel like I told you to instead of taking us on a scenic tour of murderville we could've been here on time!
I'm irritable, I'm fat and I have to pee Wow I forgot Ellen stopped coloring her hair Is it weird that she's not a redhead anymore?
Yeah, yeah It's weird she's not a lot of things anymore Red-headed, fun, nice I just don't think she likes me anymore, guys Come on Why do you say that?
Well, it's the little things she says, like "I don't like you anymore, Rob"!
Pregnant women say things Yeah She doesn't mean it Yeah, and she's on this kick about moving back to the city Really?
Oh, yeah She was grumbling about how New Jersey might not be the right place for us to raise our kid I'm sure it'll pass Oh, Trenton, Secaucus Fort Lee, Passaic - Places that suck!

Honey My mother is a con artist, ok?
I send her a check once a month to keep her out of my hair Yeah my entire childhood was spent traveling with her from town to town running scams on people Never settling down Just when I'd make a friend have 'em over for milk and cookies Bam!
It was time to move on Karen, that's shocking You drank milk?
The last town we lived in I fell in love with a boy He had long blond hair delicate features, soft skin At least I think it was a boy Well, anyway, I was in love And he or she loved me Until my mom scammed her, too Then he left me That was when I left home and never looked back Karen, this isn't something you can runaway from It's not like a hotel bill or a crying baby Forget it, Jack There are some things you just can't forgive Wait I can't let you do this Look, when I found my father it was too late to connect with him because he was dead And I don't want the same thing to happen to you So please just go in and have one drink with her, ok?
No!
I got back in there she'll pull me into one of schemes and I'll be right back where I started from I will absolutely not have one drink with her Three drinks?

This is about how you ruined everything for me as a kid Oh, come on, Keeks We had good times Remember the summer we went to Lake George?
Yeah, I remember I had to stay wrapped up in a blanket from head to toe cause you told everybody at the country club I was allergic to the sun and if we didn't raise $10,000 for my operation I'd have to live under the stairs for the rest of my life And we fished You used me, Mom I was never anything more than a prop to you The poor little blind girl with the big rack Or the poor little welfare child with the big rack Or the poor little gardener's daughter With the big rake It hurt me, Mom I wanted a mother not a business partner Oh, Kiki I am so sorry Maybe I wasn't winning any mother of the year awards then, but, you know we're different people now but we're still family I still love you I see So you reappear after all this time say you're sorry and I'm supposed to forgive you, just like that?

Why, did you find another French fry in your pocket?
No.

- We love it here!
Mm-hmm We were almost attacked right in front of the building!
A hospital This is gonna be good I cannot believe I let you talk me into doing this trying to get some poor sap to sign his will over to you before he drops dead No decent woman does that after 35!
He's not a poor sap, honey That sap shorted Enron at 56 Now come on What's going on?
What's happening?
Why aren't you moving?
Where's that thing I asked you to sign?

You know, it really hurts me that you gave me that Mm-hmm Well, it's gonna hurt a lot more if you don't sign it Fork it over, froggy!
It's signed Good thing I became a notary for that Chicago job we pulled Ok, now, I have been working this guy for months And everything was going according to plan until he took a turn for the worse So, I gotta close this deal quick and I can't do it alone which is why I brought in my poor down-on-her-luck daughter who's also a little slow How slow?
Well, you were a cheerleader but you never stopped clapping Oh, it makes me sick to think I'm gonna help you bilk a man out of his hard-earned money That reminds me I gotta call Stan Where's a phone?
I'm gonna go in first Here.
Here, you change into this Oh, good Lord Look at this outfit!
Is Grace in on this, too?
Well, there we were, crossing what the New York Times called the third most dangerous street in the country - and--and-- - And there he was-- The Upper Westside Slasher!
They said they caught him but I guess that swarthy one-eyed killing machine is back Damn him Damn him to hell!
So why is it that I haven't of this killer guy?
- Who was that?

I heard it that time!
Ok!

Come on, Rob I gotta pee Why does he have to help her pee?
I don't know Couples are weird Where'd you get gum?
Oh, sorry Well, this isn't working We'll have to go back to Plan A You mean tell Ellen the baby's not hers?
No We just explain that we're very sorry but we're taking the place back and nothing they do or say is gonna stop us - Ellen's water broke!
- Baby's coming!
So you wouldn't wanna talk right now?
So we're not gonna get that apartment back, are we?

I'm busy Your mother's making me wipe off some of my blush or, as she put it "I want to see the girl under the clown".
My father is still seeing Tina What?
We're sitting at the table We're talking about the cruise then all of a sudden, he's like "can I bring a buddy"?

Ok Um Come on Is Tim Short for "Timothy"?
Tim's not short for anything You see?
And I thought I was being safe there How did this evenstart?
Well, let's see I was complaining to George that he was never at home and he said "well, get a hobby".
So I did And then when I turned out that my tennis pro was homosexual I got another hobby - Forgot the cake - Afraid of an elevator - Forgot the cake - Afraid of an elevator - Cake forgetter!
- Elevator afraider!
My feet are killing me If I knew we were gonna do all this walking I would've worn flats Yeah?
Well, if I'd known we were gonna do all this walking I would've saddled up Rosario like when we go to Greece There's your damn cake!
Now we have to walk all the way back up This is so stupid!
Whatever made you afraid of an elevator anyway?
I'll never forget it My fellow office workers and I were heading down to lunch and, suddenly The lights went out the elevator dropped, and Dennis Hopper said he would kill us all if his demands weren't met I thank God Keanu Reeves was there to get us out Karen, that wasn't you That was the opening scene of Speed Oh You know, that movie was not at all what was advertised You think you're going to see a feel-good movie about amphetamines and, suddenly you're on a bus?
Wh--?
Wait So you're not afraid of elevators?
Guess not So we walked all the way down the stairs for nothing?
Guess so Heh heh I can't believe this I feel like such an idiot!
Well - We better start up again - I'll lead the way What?
You brought me here I know I'm stalling for time I have something to tell you and it's really hard - Well, ease into it, then - Your mother's having an affair And where was the easing into that?
- She is, Will - She is not What were her exact words?
- "Can I bring a buddy"?
- Oh, my God, she's having an affair Who is it?
What?
Her tennis pro?
No He's gay Peter?
Really?
So, who is it?
Her yoga instructor-- Tim who isn't short for anything Fantastic Everybody's cheating on everybody!
Suddenly, my parents are Fleetwood Mac  What am I gonna do about this?
You're not gonna do anything They're fine They each have someone now They're even so just leave it alone It's like a scab Don't pick at it Oh, what are you talking about?
You always pick at scabs You scratch yourself just so you'll have a scab to pick at I have changed I've learned Please We've never changed or learned anything in our lives Will, I'm telling you and I'm not saying that I understand it But this is what works for your family And, just look at them They do look pretty happy They are happy Ok, but I'm not comfortable with this Then, again, I'm not comfortable with Jim Carrey in dramatic roles but I guess that's just one more thing I'm gonna have to get used to Whoo!
Oh, boy.
Oh!
- Hi, you guys - Hey Where have you guys been?
We were expecting you to be here, like, an hour ago Ahh Well The first time we took the stairs 'cause Karen was afraid of the elevators-- Ha!
And then the second time we took the stairs because Oh!
This cruise is unbelievable You can have lunch any time of the day I guess I can do that anyway but for some reason it's more exciting on a boat And there is so much to do Oh, look at that Ice-skating lessons with Michelle Kwan To be fair when he bought the tickets that seemed like a much bigger deal Hey, they've got a driving range on this boat You know I just may grab my balls and my club and sneak off and play a little All right Well, while you're sneaking off doing that maybe I'll just sneak off and um Do a little yoga Why don't you two just say what's really going on?
Scab You're still seeing Tina and you're seeing some guy named Tim And it's been picked Tim?
What's a Tim?
You're having an affair with a guy named Tim?
What does he wear, a propeller hat?
Well, I wouldn't call it an affair, exactly It's really just uh, it's kind of a-- Oh, the hell with it It is an affair All right, I said it!
It's an affair!
I don't believe what I'm hearing Did you hear what-- You want-- Am I supposed to-- I can't even finish a thought Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary~ Happy anniversary~ Would you get the hell outta here?
No!
We hauled this cake up It has our blood, sweat and tears in it, literally Now, you're gonna eat the cake and you're gonna like the cake!
Yeah We're exhausted and we're not going anywhere Hey, look, the bar's open and a homo See ya I'm gonna leave you two to talk about this Come on, Grace We'll wait over here But the cake's that way Oh, my God They're holding hands This could turn out to be a good anniversary after all You know, they talk it out clear the air maybe discover some of the things they loved about each other to begin with This cruise could be like a second honeymoon, you know?
Unlike the first, she won't be pregnant with my stupid brother - Oh, darling, hello - So, uh Well?
Well, we talked it out Great And I think for the first time in a really long time we really heard each other I'm so glad - And we're separating - What?
We think it's for the best, darling I'm so sorry, kiddo I mean, you planned this nice dinner and you spent all that money on the cruise I don't care about the cruise Look, I don't want you to do this Please don't do this You should not do this You're doing this Oh, Grace I found this under the table leg I think it's yours Well, sweetie, looks like you and I are goin' on a cruise-- Sun, sand Oh, look Wednesday night in the Horizon Room Sinbad's appearing in Man of La Mancha You know this can actually be great We could use a fun vacation I'll put on my Greek fisherman's cap and you'll make me take it off and you know I love any excuse to take anti-nausea medication This is gonna be fantastic - Will - I know Come on, Jack We should go Yeah but let's stretch first We got a long walk down Yeah Ooh!
Come on Dig in Obviously, I'm not gonna be able to finish this on my own Oh, who are you kidding?
Ah, is it ridiculous to go on this cruise?
Do I really want to mope around being the saddest one on the boat?
Oh, sweetie You're not gonna be the saddest one there What?
Oh, right Michelle Kwan
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, hey, you're back Wow You missed one hell of a night Yeah?
What'd you do-- Watch "Providence," take a couple of antihistamines?
End a glass of chardonnay with an ice cube / Mmm!
It was like spring break for shut-ins How'd it go with your parents?
Well, I thought I was gonna be sad you know, going back to the house dealing with the reality of their separation but you know what?
It actually turned out to be fairly devastating - Oh, I'm sorry - Yeah they've put the house on the market so they told us kids just to take anything that really means something to us Boy, I can't imagine doing that in my parent's house Mainly because I've already stolen everything I liked and everything else is crap Well, I had to fight for it but I got something I love Oh, good Well, hopefully it Will be a reminder of all the good times that you and your family Aah!
What the hell is that freaky thing?
!
His name's Squatsie When I was 9, my brothers and I all chipped in and got him for my parent's anniversary Even though he wasn't really their taste they loved us so much they put him right in the front garden where everybody could see him Oh, that's sweet Do you think it'll fit down the chute or should we just take it to the dumpster?
Ok, I knew when I brought a gnome into this house that some would scoff but I love him!
We have been through a lot together Haven't we, Squatsie?
Right you are, Will You've always had a special place in me heart!
Oh, good He talks, too And I think I see the perfect place for him Huh?
what do you think, Squats?
Oh, I like it here, Will Um, may I offer one Squatsie-related thought?
Um, he strikes me as an outdoor gnome I mean, 'cause, look he's already wearing a jacket Why don't we keep him in our garden?
What?
That community garden plot across the street?
I thought we got rid of that two years ago Eh, there was this big form you had to fill out It was less work just to pay the bill Once again your sloth pays off You know, this is a great idea I used to sit in the garden and look at my gnome and look at the flowers sing songs Thinking about falling in love some day I even used to make wishes on him Did you wish to be gay?
Because that one really came true Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º  ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸ 24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ And, Karen, you know I wouldn't be asking for your help if I didn't feel we were like family I mean, God all we've been through Oh, I know, honey You don't have to remind me Well, you know our history together-- Those summers we spent in Sag Harbor you and Stan me and Lorraine Oh, Lorraine.
Hmm Good times I'm sorry I have no idea who you are Norman Keep going Stan's old partner We started the mattress store together - Mattress store - Remember?
Then he wanted to branch out into other businesses but I said, no I'll just not take any chances So now I've got the one little store and he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars Schmucky Norman!
Of course!
I need your help We're getting killed by the big guys and I need the money to make a T.V. commercial Karen!
Huge news!
Hello, sir I just got back from my acting class and my teacher -- Zandra-with-a-"Z" -- said my monologue was the second worst she's ever seen You hear that?
I'm getting better Honey, give me a minute, ok?
I'm catching up here with my dear old friend Norman Norman!
Norman Norman, right Listen, honey, since it means something to Stan I'll throw a few shekels your way What kind of commercial are we talking?
Oh, something simple for local cable and because the store is called "Senor Mattress," I could be lying on one of the high-end posturepedics wearing a sombrero and Lorraine could come in all sexy and cootchie-cootchie and-- Honey, honey I'm gonna stop you right there otherwise I'll never be able to drink solid foods again I think we're gonna need a real actor Yeah, well, let's see Why don't you run on home and we'll talk in a couple of days, ok?
Oh, thank you, Karen I appreciate it - Oh - Good-bye Good-bye, uh uh - Norman!
- Norman!
Whoo!
Honey we're having auditions again so break out the rulers and I'll heat up the oils No!
Karen, what about me?
!
I could star in your commercial!
/ No I'm an actor!
Do I need to remind you I almost just got that part in Seven Grooms for Seven Brothers?
Till that damn 15th guy showed up Honey, this is not some trashy downtown skit where you flit around in tights performing for homeless men in cardboard RVs We need a virile hunky, straight actor Uh, hello!
I could totally play straight!
Oh, honey, no one in the world would believe you're straight You're as gay as a clutch purse on Tony night You fell out of the gay tree hitting every gay branch on the way down And you landed on a gay guy And you did him No, no, honey your gayness can be seen from space Why, you're so gay that-- And will you be needing your own trailer?
Steve, I'm sorry we haven't been here in a while I mean We meant to it's just that you know how life gets busy and exciting and gardening sort of gets pushed to the bottom of the list I wouldn't know This is all I have - So which plot's ours?
- Right here Ta-da!
Wow Well, our sun-dried tomatoes came in I guess it's funny that you killed everything Ok I may have gone a little overboard but I figure we can afford it because of all the money we're gonna save growing our own food Well, you don't eat vegetables so unless we can grow a Ring-Ding bush I really don't see that happening Come on.
Dig in I want to make it pretty for Squatsie Yeah, let's get in there and start making things grow But I'm gonna do it from over here because I don't want to get my new gardening clothes dirty Grace, come here, you wuss Get your fingers in the earth Connect with nature It's almost spiritual, really Aah!
A worm!
A worm!
Kill it!
Kill it!
Yuh!
Hey!
Hey what are you doing getting dirt all over my prize-winning lettuce?
!
I'm sorry We just had a really close call with a worm the size of a-- a really small snake Hi, I'm Grace This is Will You know what?
Let's get one thing straight, ok?
I come here to be alone not to socialize with a couple of freaks growing hippie spinach So keep your crap off my plot and we'll get along fine Capisce?
Did he just say, "capisce"?
Whee!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, I love the Game Show Network Jack, when is your commercial gonna be on?
You've already made us sit through eight episodes of "Match Game 73".
If I have to watch one more I'm gonna "blank" in my shorts Oh, wait!
Here it is!
Here it is!
Has this ever happened to you?
Honey, are you awake?
Of course I'm awake I haven't slept in weeks - Well, do you wanna-- - No!
I'm tired, and I'm irritable You're always tired and irritable - I'm a man.
I have needs - I don't care Until we get a new mattress you're not gonna lay a hand on me Isn't there anyone out there who can help me?
Why don't you just pop in the shower and help yourself?
Shh!
Shh!
So come on down to Senor Mattress And I'll take care of all your needs Muchos gracias, Senor Mattress Gracias for everything!
Honey, that was really moving You know I think I got a little misty Down there Oh!
We should get going if we want to do some gardening Ok, let me just grab my hoe and I'll be ready I'm ready Honey, you were right You were totally convincing as a hetero - I was, wasn't I?
- Mm-hmm And guess what?
I got a little surprise for you Your first check, and, no your eyes are not deceiving you Those are two zeroes after that "1".
- Yeah.
- And listen to this For your next commercial that "one" is going to become a "two," and that second zero will disappear.
Ok?
A second commercial?
I don't think I can do that, Karen Huh?
Huh?
What?
Gin?
!
I-- I think I made an awful mistake I was so convincing as a hetero Now no one will ever cast me as gay What in the hell are you talking about?
I'm typecast!
Pigeon-chested!
Corn-holed!
Now I'll never get a chance to play the gay romantic lead in a Hollywood blockbuster movie Or the gay general leading his gay troops into battle And you can kiss my gay action hero franchise good-bye No ornery black police captain Will ever say to me You a loose cannon, Bruce Turn in your badge and your chaps and get your gay ass out of my precinct Ok.
All right I think I see what's happening here And, uh, here's what I'm gonna do For your next commercial I'm gonna put a "three" in front of that zero, ok?
That's 30 dollars No!
There's not gonna be a next commercial!
And if you were any kind of friend you'd pull that one off the air!
Ok.
Uh I'm gonna tell you what I told Stan yesterday in prison I ain't pullin' nothin' Since we started running that ad mattress sales have doubled To five!
So you're gonna keep hawkin' those beds, and you're gonna like it!
- Forget it!
I quit!
- Oh!
Oh, look!
My ride's here and it's a huff!
I believe I'll leave in it!
Aah!

I'm afraid so What is it?
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Ok, look, I know you're upset-- - How did this happen?
- Will, I-- Was-- Was it him?
!
Was it that mean guy that told us to lose it?

Oh, this is so hard for me to say, but Yes.
Yes, it was Oh, Zandra, over here Zandra Zoggin acting teacher extraordinario-- Class is full, don't bother asking!
Zandra, please sit down right here Thank you Oh, excuse me Can I get you something to drink?

Ok.
I just did a commercial Played a strappin' straighty with a yen for the ladies and, Zandra I was good I was too good, I think And now I'm plagued with doubt Should I compromise my career goals for literally tens of dollars?
I say no!
So when they asked me to do a second commercial I turned them down!
And because you're my mentor I wanted you to be the first to know You may praise me You stupid little ass monkey!
Ow!

If I still smoked I would take my Parliament and stick it in your eye!
Oh, what the hell I'm just gonna jab you with this dirty fork No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Wait!
Zandra, what about all that stuff you're always saying about how we need to make tough choices in our careers?

Excuse me, we're talking!
I hear all of Will's ties are made out of boogers I hear he got a boredom woody during study hall Oh, I get it You're bitchy school girls trying to snub me If only there was some way I could turn my pain into grim determination and become a wildly successful lawyer while the two bitchy girls grow up to become two bitchy women Someone's got a big vocabulary and a little dictionary Just give me a signature The sooner you get that over with the sooner you two Heathers can get back to your heathering Hey!

Wow, you are toxic I think you need a little gay group therapy - Oh, hey, poodle - Hi, Kare I'd love to stay and fondle but Grace's mood ring is a filthy brown today Ok - One for the road?
- Ok..
Hey, Kare did you bring me that sample I asked for?
I sure did, honey Here you go Please, God, tell me that's not your urine Oh!
Honey of course it isn't It's Rosario's This puppy has gotten me out of more jail time than you'll ever know Was that not right?
Tile samples-- I needed you to bring my-- Ok.
Ok Ok, never mind Did you take the pictures of those stools I-- Wait!
ÀÇÀÚ Ç´Â ´ëº¯) Do not answer that Do not show me anything Knock knock I thought it was rude to eavesdrop, so I just came in Oh, hey-- Hey, Val Isn't that the loon from upstairs that likes to beat you up?
- Yeah.
Get rid of her - Ok So, um, listen, Val I was just-- just bringing you your phone bill - 'cause they put it in my box - Ok, don't come any closer!
The clump of hair that you ripped outis just starting to grow back in Oh, come on, silly I'm not like that anymore You are looking at a totally new me / Why?
You finally working as a team with the people in your head?
Well, kind of Actually, I'm on this amazing new psychotropic drug I mean, sure, I have no sex drive and I'm always dizzy but I think I could be a really good friend Here So what are you working on there, G-Dog?
Um, it's a meditation room for this client I'm trying to land Wow That's nifty I'd sure love a room like that I'm surprised the court hasn't ordered you to be in a room like that Very funny!
Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle!
You're ticklish See?
You know what?
I miss this!
I miss this so much Well, now, see here's the deal We could have this-- If you were not this-- All right Hey, can I take this?
'Cause some day you're gonna be really famous and I can say that I knew you when Sure, but you know, Val I really do need to get back to work Oh, sure I just wanted to come and let you know that I'm doing a lot better Is that your urine or mine?
I confess When I first started gay group therapy I just thought it was a really great place to meet guys But now as I look around the room and I see you all looking back at me I realize it's not such a great place to meet guys Gavin the last time you shared you spoke about how your fear of rejection often leads you to make up elaborate stories in order to spend time with the men you find attractive How's that going?
Well, I'm doing it again you know, and it's killing me I--I met this really good-looking guy today at this coffee shop and instead of asking him out I offered to help him find his stolen laptop Go on, Gavin Well, I don't know why I'm so shy with men You know, maybe it's because I came out so late in my life but, you know why can't I just say, you know "Hi, I'm Gavin You want a cup of coffee"?
"A chocolate chip muffin"?
Nah, I'm a mess Maybe a cookie will cheer you up, huh?
Want a little cookie?
Hmm?
You know, I prefer the minis The cream-to-cookie ratio is just so much better for me You know?
You got something in your teeth Whatever No, really Just stop it This really freaks me out I got--I got a thing about this, ok?
So-- - Seriously?
This freaks you out?
- Stop this now, all right?
Just stop it!
I told-- Stop!
Doctor-- Jack!
You know Gavin has problems with food in teeth Now kindly respect that Sorry, Gavin Weirdo Gavin, what do you think your next move should be with this guy?
Well, I like the guy You know, I want to go out with him and I think I should be totally honest I think I should stop all these stories and just tell him the truth A gay laptop-theft ring?
You gotta be kidding me!
No, I'm afraid so It looks like you're the latest victim Why would they want gay people's computers?
Well, for one thing you know, they're organized very neat desktops usually have a carrying case You can dress it up or dress it down Anyway, that's not the point I thought we could do some surveillance We?
Well, you said you wanted to get involved Yeah No, I'd love to I love police business You have terrific teeth-- Really clean Uh, let's go undercover Say, Saturday, eight-ish?
Great Undercover, wow Hey, do I get to wear a wire?
Will we be in dark alleys with really wet streets?
I'm not afraid I'm just thinking about footwear I'm actually thinking of this hot gay club on 14th Street You know, obvious target Lots of laptop users there A club?
You really think we're gonna find the perps there?
"Perps".
That's very cute And I think the meditation room will end up being your favorite room in the house Oh, every room is my favorite now that my wife has left me Well, let me paint a picture Imagine yourself in an oasis of calm A place where the world shuts down and the noise stops Yes Exactly Your cares melt away as you step onto the heated stone floor Mmm, a warmth envelops you from within You lose yourself as you listen to the soothing trickle of the Japanese rock fountain Oh which mingles harmoniously with the soothing trickle of the morphine drip Around you cabinets full of pills await your every mood Your turn Medi-ta-tion room not medi-ca-tion room You say "potato" Anyway, I hope you're getting a sense of what I'm trying to do Yeah, yeah, it's great I'd go with it right now but I promised another designer that I would hear her ideas, too Maybe you know her?
She works right next door Next door?
When did a designer move into the-- Hey, neighbs Vince?
Whenever you're ready and I have a great idea for a meditation room Who's crazy now, huh, Grace?
You you you you you you you you!
I hate her I hate Val I'm the kind of person who doesn't hate anyone!
- You hate your sister - Well, she's hateful!
But besides her I don't hate anyone - You hate your doorman - Well, he calls me "kiddo" and clicks Besides my doorman and my sister I don't hate anyone - You hate Teri Hatcher - Oh, who doesn't?
!
Ok, fine!
So I hate a lot of people but I hate Val more!
She stole my ideas, then she has the audacity to come in here and ask to see my carpet samples?
!
Oh, she was hitting on you?
!
No to use in her presentation and I told her no way is she borrowing my stuff Over my dead body!
I think there's somebody back there stealing stuff!
- I'm gonna hit her so hard!
!
- Honey, no!
Just one in the face It's the only thing she responds to No, no, no Now come on.
Come on Come on.
Come on Now listen to me!
If there's anything I've learned from studying the ancient Chinese art of t'ai chi it's that if you do it in the morning a couple hours later you're gonna want to do it again You know what I'm talking about?
But if there's another thing I learned is that violence is never the answer You're right of course, of course you're right Oh ho!
Come on, come on now!
Now, the important thing is to blend in Remember we are two gay laptop users on a date - It's only a matter of time - All right Should I be wearing a bullet-proof vest?
Or, considering this is a gay bar a bullet-proof leather vest?
No, you look fine, Will You're doing the right thing If we had more people like you we'd get some of that scum off the streets Now, look at me like you love me What?
Oh!
Oh, I see Because the-- Right Ok, um how's this?
I'm sorry It's just-- you--you looked like you were buying it Did I?
You know I'm kinda surprised that anybody would bring their laptop to a bar - Hold my hand - Sure You know, but I guess gay people are more likely to come straight from the office with their laptops have a few drinks and that's when it happens That's a good observation You'd make a hell of a cop-- Perceptive, intelligent You got a set of eyes like two inviting pools of chocolate pudding Well, we look for that on the force Love this song Got a good beat I guess that would make us "good beat" cops You wanna dance?
Oh!
Oh, so that way we leave the laptops unattended Yeah, sure Whatever Hey, that guy looks suspicious He's in a gay bar eating a hot dog without any irony You stay right where you are I'm gonna try to get a better view Oh, yeah I can see a lot better from back here I want my baby back baby back, baby back I want my baby back baby back, baby back.
I want-- Oh, hey, honey - How you doing?
- Great I took all my anger towards Val and I put it entirely into my work Well, maybe not entirely I did make a crank call to Teri Hatcher That's so funny, Vince!
- Hi, Grace - Hey, G-Love Listen, I ran into Val in the lobby and she had an interesting idea to combine both of your presentations into the same meeting What do you think, huh?
Well, um, you know I'm not really one to combine things I mean, I can't even eat my peas if they're touching the meat especially if the meat is crazy But--but if it will save you time then let's do it Yeah, let's do it 'Cause this woman has more talent in her little-boy breasts than you have in your whole body Ok, I have some sketches here for the living room I have some sketches, too, Vince but unfortunately they're up here in the ol' kanoodle Ok Why don't we now hear some ideas for the bedroom?
Ok.
Well, first of all I think what we need to do in here is to-- Create an intimate feeling And I thought-- One way we could accomplish that is to upholster the walls with a lovely silk moir?
..
silk moir?
That will give the room a sense of luxury and it will also absorb some of the sound .
some of the sound Your other option, of course is to cover the walls with-- Stop it You stop it!
You stop it!
You're a nutjob!
You're a nutjob!
You're a nutjob!
You're a nutjob!
You're a nutjob!
- You're a nutjob!
- Ladies, ladies!
Oh, ladies Vince I think these two ponies need to be hosed down Come out in the hallway for a minute while I talk to them, ok?
- Yeah, sure - Thanks So what's the matter, Grace?
You can't compete with another designer who actually has a little talent?
!
- You stole my ideas, freak show!
- Oh, puh-leaze!
You!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Come Come.
Come.
No, no, no, no Come on, ladies.
Stop it!
Stop it right now, both of you!
Come here.
Come here Come here right now Oh!
Come here Whoa.
Now, listen to me!
I'm ashamed of both of you If there is one thing that I have learned from studying the ancient Chinese art of t'ai chi is that violence is never the answer but sometimes it is T'ai chi!
Is she out?
She's out Ok.
Honey, you go get Vince I'll get rid of the body Uh, should we maybe go-- We should keep dancing The number-one lesson when you're on a stakeout is never change your spot if it's good Ok La la la la la.
La la la la la~~~ A-doobie doobie do-doo~~~ - Hey, that's annoying - Hang on.
Let me just get this out Oh!
Feel a little awkward It's been a long time since I slow-danced with a cop whose gun is poking me in the back I hope Sh-sh-sh-sh-shh Yeah, you know actually I could use a drink Oh, yeah I'll get you one, honey Did--did you-- Did you just call me "honey"?
Uh, cop talk It's the way we talk at the precinct-- Honey, sweetie, Sarge I'll get you a drink Oh, my God!
We need to talk When were you gonna tell me you were dating freaky teeth guy?
!
"Freaky teeth guy"?
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into I'd help you but it's not my problem Tell me about freaky teeth guy Let's see We got spinach dip, chives poppy seed bagel and chocolate chip cookies Uh, you got anything else?
Oh, I'll just bring it anyway in case we change our minds You know, detective, I-- I have to confess Um at one point tonight when I was with you I kind of forgot we were even looking for my laptop I--I just felt like I was with you You know what I mean?
I know what you mean The Sarge at the precinct had an expression for it-- Chemistry But you're not even gay Guess I'm barking up the wrong tree Woof!
Woof!
- You mean you're-- - Yes, I am I'm not gonna lie about it anymore because there's one thing-- Don't touch the dip Oh, I'm sorry.
I just need to nosh when I'm nervous Go on No, well, you know, the first time I saw you when this investigation began I wasn't sure-- I'm not kidding about the dip Just--I just want a little bit All right, Will I want you to drop the bagel and step away from the dip - Ok.
Maybe just one cookie - Why'd you do that?
!
- Problem, officer?
- Oh!
What's the matter, detective?
Afraid you'll see some food in my teeth?
Just like you're afraid to ask guys out so you make up some crazy story in order to spend time with them?
Who told you that?
Let's just say I know a little bird who sang Who?
!
La la la la la.
La la la la la La la la la la la-la la la?
There is no gay laptop ring, is there?
?
No And cops don't call each other "honey"?
No Or "sweetie"?
One does Will, this is new to me You know, it's really hard I've never dated before Oh, please!
You've already done the hard part You came out Now is when you're supposed to have a little fun Don't do this to yourself Just go and ask a guy out The worst he can say is no And even then you'll probably still get a little action I mean, we are guys That's good advice, Will Thank you So is there anything you want to ask me?
I don't think so not with that crap on your teeth Take care

I--I don't want this in any book What?
No!
I mean what are you gonna do?
You can't go back to Fannie Lieber and tell her that you want a re-shoot Since when are you afraid to tell people what you think?

I mean, don't you have lives?
Yes, we have lives I just got TiVo And I am this close to learning how to use it Well, how about getting something real to focus on like a dog or a plant or an addiction?
I mean, something Look, I know Grace and having some plant is not gonna make her care any less about looking like H.R. Puffy-Face And a dog is not gonna make him care any less about looking repulsive - Why do you have to dig?
- I'm not digging - You just called me repulsive - I didn't call you "grotesque".
Oh, please!
You're just splitting hairs now.
Repulsive-- Just do something Have a baby I don't know I don't care Just get out of my life Hey, that's a good idea Let's have a baby Sure.

Ok, What do you wanna see?
how 'bout something French like with two girls kissing?
It's my day off I don't feel like reading Hey, sweetie We're thinking about going to a movie What do you wanna see?
Anything but a documentary It's my day off I don't wanna learn What's up with the wine?
Mrs. Friedman from downstairs gave it to me It's actually a wonderful story She and her husband were saving itfor a special occasion but then he, uh, died before they had a chance to open it so she gave it to me and said "Make your own special occasion" I guess that story's not so much wonderful as it is incredibly sad You know what else is incredibly sad?
Poor people with big dreams Actually, that's not so much sad as it is incredibly funny You know, we should do this We should save that wine for a special occasion You know, something where-- where the four of us have all done something that we're incredibly proud of You know, we can wait 20 years if we have to Ah, screw it.
Open it I wanna have a buzz for the movies One step ahead of you I never gave a crap about Mr. Friedman You know I hope I don't have any regrets like that when I'm 75 I know How do you deal with it, Karen?
Oh!
Oh, Wilma I have so much money You know the one thing I really wanna do before i die?
Run the marathon It would be such a feeling of accomplishment Mile one, down Mile 2, down Mile 3, down Mile 4, down - All right!
- We get it, we get it, we get it!
You know what I've always wanted to do?
Perform on the Broadway stage The make up, the wigs the costumes And then I'd walk to the theater You know there is something I've been putting off for a long time And I've avoided it because well frankly it scares me a little I'm supposed to have a conjugal visit with Stan You know what?
We should do all of these things Oh, come on, honey that's easy for you to say All you gotta do is run a lousy marathon Stan weighs 5,000 pounds It's 26 miles just circling him!
No, I'm serious I'm tired of talking about it all the time I am going to train for the marathon and I am going to do it You know what, G?

Well, there's something I wanna have a baby, you know I wanna have a child And you should someday You're gonna make a terrific father Yeah, But I wanna do it now And I wanna do it with you Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º  ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ-³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸ 24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ I guess you're one of those therapists that likes us to start I hate that I mean, I--I don't hate you just your methods I don't know you well enough to hate you Not to suggest that if I did know you I would hate you but I guess it is always a possibility I mean, if you said something hateful, I-- $4 a minute, Grace Ok, Let me just get you up to speed Gay Straight Gentile Jew Sold We've been best friends for, like one day we'd have a baby together And I wanna do it now and she's not so sure and ever since I brought it up she's been avoiding me and we've been having stupid fights I haven't been avoiding you You have, too!
I--I--I come in the room and you scurry behind the couch like a silverfish Do you have to go to the anti-Semitic place?
What are you talking about?
Silver fish?
Silverberg?
Gefilte fish?

!
Yeah, Ok Thanks, honey See you back at the mans I'm in the nude for love Scooba da boo, salami Just in case he forgets his way What the?
A security camera?
!
Oh, I cannot believe this!
Oh, whatever happened to privacy?
I am outraged I'm appalled!
I'mI'm turned on!
Hot jazz!
What's that you say?
Sure, he can dance but can he sing?
Maria.
I just met a "girl" named Maria and suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be "Maria," say~~~ what does that mean right there?
What's going on there?
'Cause that's in my sightline, ok?
You know, um, when they flash the red light at the duplex that means they want the guy to get off the stage!
Oh, no, I'm not leaving No, I'm not getting off this stage I--I--I'm gonna read for your play and do you know why?
Because I want it to be a runaway hit!
Hey!
Hey!
You don't even know who I am!
You don't even know what I can offer!
Why, I could--I could be the next Sir Judi Dench or Dame Ian McKellen!
Do you really wanna be known as the producers who passed that up?
Oh, my god, it totally worked Ok, look I don't know if I'm ready for this I mean, there's a lot of things?
I wanna do with my life and I don't know if I can do it with a baby I wanna travel the world Anywhere Everywhere You know, as long as it's clean and they speak English and it's safe You've just narrowed your world travel plans down to Denver Grace, what is the problem?
What are you-- what are you doing here?
We've always talked about doing this / I know-- And you're always making us stop in front of baby gap to go "aw"!
at the little high tops And the-- and the little baby backpacks!
I mean, why would a baby need a backpack?
Maybe to carry stuff to his homies' cribs I don't know!
Let's just have a baby and find out Come on what's holding you back?
- I don't know It's just-- - what?
I--I guess a part of me does wanna have a baby, but Grace, it's me If there's something you wanna say, just say it I'm just not sure I wanna do it with you What are you.
What do you mean you don't wanna do it with me?
For years, we've talked about how we're gonna do this!
When my--when my friend Claire wanted my sperm so she could have a baby you said no because it was your sperm!
You practically planted a flag in my testicles!
Well, that's because it is my sperm But it's my safety sperm You know, like the safety school?
You--you apply to college and it's the one school, you know you're gonna get into just in case everything else falls through You're saying my sperm is Florida State?
Look, it-- it was a fallback position It was always the thing that I was gonna do if I didn't find Mr Right and I'm just not sure that I'm ready to give up on that yet Yeah, well, you know you're probably right I mean, just 'cause it didn't work out with Danny or Nathan or Josh or Ben or Bill or Mark or Six-Toe or Unibrow It doesn't mean it won't work out with that pizza guy you've been eyeing I'm sure you two will be very happy together, you know with your three beautiful children Pepperoni, Mushroom and Extra Cheese That was mean You know, this is all very easy for you I have the kid ,You're a dad You're happy But who am I in all this?
The mom of my gay roommate's baby?
That's not exactly the family I dreamed of Well, you--you think this is my dream?
I never thought I'd have a child this way!
I assumed I'd be with a guy!
You know Rick, and six years into the relationship when we got tired of running a bed and breakfast in Vermont we'd decide to have a family Ok, well, what about Rick?
Where is Rick?
Is he in the TV room where you spend every Saturday night?
Does he appear on the gay channel that you added and don't think I know about?
I mean, you sat here and you listed my--my failures!
At least I have failures to list!
At least I tried!
You haven't had a serious relationship in five years!
No, I haven't!
Well, then maybe you need to ask yourself why you want this baby Is it because you are so full of love?
And there's no one in your life?
?
And so now you wanna make a little guy or girl to give it to?
So what?
Isn't that a perfectly good reason to have a baby?
I mean, isn't it?
Isn't it?
It isn't, is it?
So you're really going to watch us have sex?
Well, honey it isn't going to be pretty The good news is it isn't going to be long either And it should be pretty quick, too I like you Stanley?
Hi, sweetheart Oh, I know it's been so long I can't wait to run up and throw my arms two-thirds of the way around you So come on-- What?
What do you mean you're not coming?
What happened?
You, son of a bitch How could you do this to me?
Well, it's been fun, cammie but I'm outta here Yeah The bastard used his library time to do a little insider trading They found out now he's going to be in for a lot longer Why couldn't he use his library time to read the Bible or expose himself to the newbies like the rest of the boys on Cellblock Fat?
What?
!
No, you listen I've been putting on a brave face for eight months well, eight months ago in Brazil I had one put on But do you think this has been easy for me?
Well, it hasn't But I thought you were getting out soon so I held on?
so that we could start our lives over And then you go and do this you screwed up, Stan No, I don't-- no, I don't know if I can forgive you And I'll tell you something else Mr Walker I'm tired, and I don't know if I can do this anymore Did you know about this?
And you didn`t tell me You should be ashamed of yourself I guess I just got caught up in the romantic notion of what it would be like to have a baby with her, you know?
I mean, you'd be all gorgeous and pregnant and glowing and booby and when you had the baby I'd be in the delivery room When you were pushing and screaming at me to rot in hell I would And we'd raise him with the values that were important to us Respect for other people's opinions except for you know ones that were different than ours On his first date with a girl--or a boy Or if it's a girl, a boy or a girl we'd be home all nervous and waiting but acting like we weren't Then one day when he went off to college we'd wave good-bye and look at each other and say "You know what"?
"We did a good job" I want to have a baby with you!
Let's see "Please, Mr O'Shaughnessy I'm begging you" "I can't stand out here any longer in this unbearable" "heat" Oh it's hot "We need food or else I fear my family will perish" "and my harp will break" "heart" "My heart will break" I said "harp will break" Did you hear that?
Harp!
Bblllingg Bing!
Harp!
Where was I?
Let's see, OK!
"Deirdre's got no milk for the wee one and the oldest girl is dead" Harp!
I can't believe I said harp!
That is the funniest I thought the "P" was a "T" That's so funny Ok, ok, wait "So please I'm begging you" "it's only a loaf of bread to you but for us, it's life" Let me-- let me try that again "It's only a loaf of bread to you" "it's only a loaf of bread" "It's only" I'm just going to stop Ok, I just..
it's just, um This isn't It's me I'm not good, am I?
Wait, don't answer that I already know All these years everybody keeps telling me Thanks for your time, though You can, um, put your red light on now 'cause I-- I'm done with all of this I'm not an actor Really, it's ok You can turn it on And scene I can't.
I, uh I'm so confused You-- you want to have a baby now?
I do Do you?
I don't!
What?
But the reason we're here is because you wanted to have a baby I did, but then you talked me out of it But then you talked me into it with all your talk about talking me out of it But you haven't talked me back into it with all your talk of--of-- Talk me back into it!
Oh, this is ridiculous We don't sound like two people who should be having a child This is something we should be sure of Yeah, you're right I mean it'sit's not like super-sizing a happy meal Yeah, 'cause that's always a yes Will, we can do this I don't see how I can I mean what if-- w-what if I am doing this for all the wrong reasons?
What difference does it make what your reasons are for wanting to love a child?
Isn't the most important thing the love part?
And as far as I'm concerned if Mr Right and the father of my child turns out to be two different people would that be so bad?
What?
We got a million reasons not to do this but I I just keep imagining this kid in some cosmic waiting room and he's our kid And I'd really like to meet him Me, too Are we doing this?
I mean, are we going to have a baby?
Oh, my god I guess we are!
Well, we have two minutes left Is there anything we haven't covered?
I don't know After something that huge it's kind of hard to, uh She never cleans up and it really bugs me It's just a response to his compulsiveness Everything in the refrigerator has to face forward How else are you going to know what it is, huh?
Say something!

Well, you know in my office, in a file folder Under "O" for offspring Here with us!

Is this because I'm gay?
You feel you failed somehow and now you need to get a new baby and start all over again?

- Uh, hello?
!
His own son was the result of insemination So if anyone knows I think I do Elliot!
Insemination The guy goes to this lab where he deposits his sperm then the doctor puts it into this machine that spins it around to get the best sample The woman goes to another place where her doctor waits for the sample to arrive from the lab Then the doctor inserts the sample with a syringe, and hopefully, that results in fertilization Wow I know So clinical - So impersonal - I know It sounds perfect Yeah And I don't have to shave my legs You know, the female reproductive system is so amazing It's a miracle, really So complex So beautiful Yow!
What is that thing?
!
God!

No, I do not!
For jewels, for furs for mixed securities, like a lady!
But for money?
How dare you?
!
A thousand apologies I don't suppose there's any way you might forgive me for my highly inappropriate gaffe and allow me to buy you a drink?
Well that's very kind of you, Mr. Banks but I don't think that's such a good idea Is there a problem, my sweet?
You're not married, are you?
Well, as a matter of fact no, I'm not This is so depressing I was so sure that by the end of the day today I would be with child Instead, I'm just with doughnut Well, you're still ovulating, right?
Well, first thing tomorrow we'll go down to the sperm bank we'll start all over again Oh, gosh There's gotta be an easier way to do this I mean, there's what five billion people in the world?

Only the entertainer part of you, Jack That's why I sent for you The world needs you But I can't go back to performing I've already broken it to my fan I'm a retail queen now No, you're not, Jackie You're the little boy who used to dance naked in front of his mirror Who grew up and-- and became that sensitive young teenager who danced naked in front of his mirror And spent way too much time at the gym to become the young man who dances naked in front of his mirror Don't ever stop dancing, Jack Don't ever stop dancing Show business needs you But if it needs me how come I keep getting rejected?
You know, don't talk to me about rejection, ok?
I mean, look how many times I've gone down in flames Remember, I lost the Oscar for Moonstruck But you won the Oscar for Moonstruck!
And don't you forget it And if that doesn't convince you Hit it, boys!
