{START OF EPISODE 1}
This is Sabrina's 18th birthday party and I want everything to be perfect.
Eighteen?
I can't believe it.
She'll be leaving home soon.
Starting a whole new life.
Making new friends.
A new place to live.
We probably won't see her much anymore.
She'll be too busy to visit her silly old aunts.
I'm home.
Yeah, but not for long.
Ahh.
We can't let her see us all teary.
Happy faces.
Not the smiling spell.
Oh.
This is gonna be the best year ever.
I heard that Libby's parents are sending her to boarding school.
I guess Children of the Corn Academy has reopened.
If you'll excuse me, I'm off to Chocolate Town.
See?
She's leaving us already.
Our little witch is all grown up.
You still have little me.
What do you think if I put my bed here and Valerie's bed up against that wall?
How about we put Valerie's bed where it belongs?
With her family in Alaska.
Salem, I'm sorry, but I asked if it's okay if Valerie comes to stay.
But I thought you said, "I'd like to get you a valet".
Valerie's my friend.
I can't let her finish high school in Anchorage.
She looks terrible in mukluks.
And remember, while she's here, no talking.
Something in your eye or an aneurysm, either way, take it outside.
I'm trying some nonverbal communication.
That was Morse code for: I can't believe those aunts agreed to let Valerie come live with us.
Yeah, every so often, they're shockingly cool.
I can't believe you agreed to let Valerie come live with us.
Me?
I believe you're the one who said, "Gee, it'd be nice to have a mortal around the house for a change".
First of all, I never say, "Gee".
The point is we agreed.
We're just gonna have to learn to get along without magic around the house for nine months.
It's Sabrina's last year at home,  and I want everything to be perfect.
You're right.
In nine months, we can do all the magic that we want.
There won't be any teenagers around  to tell us how un-cool and out of style we are.
I can always do that for you.
Thanks, Zellie.
Don't forget the one from your dad.
Okay, not a car, so I'm going with my second choice.
It must be tickets to the Britney Spears concert.
- Surprise.
- Dad.
If the rest of you is in a Porsche, I'm the happiest girl in the world.
I guess that explains the air holes.
Sabrina, I'm afraid my present is a little bit selfish this year.
- Men's shoes again?
- No.
I'm semi-retiring from the Other Realm Foreign Service, so I'm gonna be settling down.
I want you to come to Paris and live with me.
- Live with you?
- Right now?
Well, of course not.
She needs time to pack.
I don't know what to say.
I know.
How about, "Thanks, but, no, thanks"?
Would you excuse us?
We have to check on those cakes.
Mm.
- We can't let him do this.
He can't just pop in here and take our Sabrina away.
He's her father.
Of course he can.
We knew this day would come.
Yes, but not for a long, long time.
Oh.
It's not fair.
And there are paw prints all over my cake.
When I'm upset, I eat.
Now, listen, you've got to promise me that you're not gonna try to influence Sabrina's decision.
If she wants to leave us, well  Dad, I'll be right back.
Isn't this fantastic?
Dad said he and Gail live in the magic quarter in Paris.
And their apartment is actually in the Eiffel tower.
Think about how many thousands of Japanese snapshots I'll be in.
- Are you crying?
- Onions.
New cake recipe.
Sometimes I just don't understand Martha Stewart.
Happy birthday.
Wow, this must be a fantastic party.
You two look like you're having a really good time.
Whoo-hoo.
Tickets to the Britney Spears concert.
Actually, they're parking-lot passes.
We have to listen to the concert from outside, but we might get to see her when she runs to her limo.
Whoo-hoo.
Parking-lot passes to the Britney Spears concert.
You know, Sabrina, I think this is gonna be the best year ever.
And so I just don't think I can go right now.
There's Harvey, and senior year starts tomorrow, and I have a friend moving in with me.
And I hear the French can be really rude.
Sabrina, it's okay.
I understand.
Just promise me you'll think about it.
I miss having you close by.
I promise.
Checking each other for chiggers.
Tell me this means what I think it means.
That my mother was right, I should've taken those classes to become a court reporter?
No, that Mr. Kraft is not coming back, thus proving that prayers are answered.
They told me to take his name off the door.
- A new vice principal starts today.
- No Libby, no Kraft.
So this is what it's like to peak.
Hey, guess what.
If my day keeps going the way it's been going, you've got gold for me?
No, but I have news.
Do you remember Brad?
Your best friend who moved back to Texas?
The guy who used to burn ants with a magnifying glass?
That's the guy, and he's back.
Come on.
I can't wait for you to meet him.
Oh, glad to see you learned how to catch while I was gone.
- Hi, Brad.
- Oh, hey, right back at you, Courtney.
Hey, Brad.
I'd like you to meet Sabrina.
Sabrina?
Oh, it's about time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, Joe.
Nice to meet you too.
Isn't he great?
Yeah, good thing I don't have a thorax.
Why can't we put all this in the basement with the rest of the junk?
Well, because we have to pack up all our potions before Valerie arrives.
So I thought we might as well go through them.
For example, this frog's tongue expired in 1872.
Help.
Fire.
Help, help.
Salem.
That's a real toaster.
I packed up the magic one this morning.
It's only for toast.
Well, that's stupid.
Hm!
You ordered a king-sized cat bed with magic fingers?
And where do you expect to put that, Hef?
Sabrina's room.
It's custom, so you have to order it months in advance.
- In advance of what?
- Sabrina going away to college.
While you sisters have been snivelling at the thought of it, I've been planning ahead.
Nine months, and Salem's getting his own pad.
Yeah, baby.
Good luck opening the door.
Gah?
Okay, so you excited to be back?
Must be great to know everyone-- Yes, so whatever.
Okay, if he calls me a freak, I know Libby got a hold of some male hormones.
Hey, there's Brad.
He saved us a seat.
I think he saved you a seat.
Harvey, I really don't think he likes me.
What are you talking about?
Of course he likes you.
Hey, could we make some room for Sabrina?
- Yeah, sure.
- See?
- I was just getting up.
- See?
Hey, Brad.
Do you have some kind of problem with Sabrina?
Sabrina?
She's cool.
Why?
No reason.
Forget about it.
He thinks you're great.
All we've been doing is sitting around the house, crying.
Why don't we go out and cheer ourselves up?
That's a great idea.
Hey, that revival house downtown is playing a fabulous double feature.
Terms of Endearment and Sophie's Choice.
Perfect.
I could use a good cry.
Kinkle, think fast.
- Ha-ha.
don't forget, my place, 7:30.
- We'll be there.
What's going on at 7:30?
I thought we had a date.
The guys are having this welcome-back thing for Brad, and I figured we could combine it with our date.
Shoot, and I was hoping we could go out for Chinese water torture.
What's this problem you have with Brad?
The only problem I have with Brad is that Brad has a problem with me.
I can kind of see why.
You're not being very welcoming.
Yeah, that friendly thing I do is so off-putting.
Fine, we won't go to Brad's house and have fun.
- We'll go out.
- Maybe I don't wanna go out.
Great, because I don't think I wanna take you out.
Great.
Not great.
Hey.
Mr. Kraft?
What are you doing here?
You're not vice principal anymore.
True.
Ineffectual, purely-a-figurehead Vice Principal Kraft is no more.
Now, it is all-seeing, all-powerful Principal Kraft.
Principal?
What am I, Job?
This is gonna be the best year ever.
Hello?
Crisis.
Aunt Hilda?
Aunt Zelda?
Where is everybody?
Oh.
They're having fun at the movies as opposed to being here where they should be while I'm having force-five freak-out.
- Salem, I'm in full crisis mode.
- Nya-huh.
You think a mirrored ceiling would be too much or just enough?
Salem.
If this is someone trying to switch my long-distance, I swear Valerie?
Oh, thank goodness, someone to talk to.
Listen, Mr. Kraft is principal.
Harvey has this obnoxious friend and we had a huge fight and-- Wait, aren't you supposed to be on a plane?
What?
No, of course I understand.
Sure.
Okay, bye.
Valerie's not coming.
She can't leave her family.
Yes, look who's talking now.
This is gonna be the worst year of my life.
Unless Sabrina, where are you going?
Paris.
Dear Harvey, the view from my dad's apartment is My dad's apartment is located in the Eiffel The cheese is great.
Ah.
Hey, Melvin, you want me to get you some food?
That's your stepbrother's job.
Donald.
- Thank you.
- Silly me.
I was gonna do it the mortal way, but then I'm so bourgeois.
Okay, we'd better get going if we wanna beat the crowds at Euro Disney again.
I'll get Donald.
Actually, I was kind of hoping I'd be starting school today.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting to look into that.
Look, why don't I just zap you in a tutor?
You like Einstein?
Thanks, but Even if kids here do consider bathing a quirky personality trait, I think I'd rather be going to a regular high school with kids my own age.
You are definitely your mortal mother's daughter.
All right, let's go.
Actually, I think I'm gonna hang out here today.
I'm feeling a little homesick.
Or maybe it's the cream sauce from breakfast.
Well, you can always check up on people on the Mortal Channel.
I mean, I paid for the premium package.
Somebody might as well use it.
Yeah, watching people who probably don't care less that I'm gone.
That will cheer me up.
We'll have a good day together, won't we, just you and me?
Right, Melvin?
Melvin?
Yo, Kinkle, think fast.
Hey, you've been wearing that shirt for three days.
Four.
This is what I was wearing the last time I saw Sabrina.
Yeah, get it all in there.
What are you doing to Sabrina's locker?
Erasing every last memory and molecule of Miss Spellman.
I don't know if I wanna check up on Harvey.
We had that stupid fight and he probably doesn't even miss me.
All right, quit badgering me.
I'll look.
Well, he certainly seems to be keeping his anguish in check.
Yeah, apparently the healing has begun.
He is so over me.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Kinkle, for helping me demonstrate how stimulating the nervous system can provoke an involuntary response.
In this case, laughter.
- Ahem.
- Sabrina's ticklish behind the ears.
And may I recommend a strong antifungal?
I hate substituting.
Hilda, please, pull yourself together.
You've got to stop crying.
Why?
Because whenever I see you doing it, I start.
Oh, sure, blame me.
Yeah, it's all Hilda's fault.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to take it out on you.
You're all I have.
Think how I feel.
You're all I have.
Here.
Help with these boxes.
It's good to keep busy.
And be careful.
There are potions in there.
I know.
You don't always have to-- Oh.
Wanna wreak havoc in Gotham City?
Harvey might not care that I'm gone, but I'm sure my aunts miss me.
Uncontrollable laughter must be one of the stages of grief.
You looked ridiculous.
Oh, me?
You should have seen you.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
They're so happy I'm gone, they're giddy.
Wait, wait, do you hear something?
I hear crying.
Salem?
Finally, someone misses me.
Granted, I would have bet big money it wouldn't be the cat.
Salem, are you all right?
Oh, tell Zelda what's the matter.
It's It's It's the drapes.
They clash with the new comforter.
And I can't return them.
My bed's not even cold and he's moving in already.
It seems like the only person who's excited to see me is my dad.
I've got to do everything possible to try to fit in here.
What do you think?
You're dead, aren't you, Melvin?
You self-absorbed cat.
I know that's redundant.
Okay, truth time.
I don't care about curtains.
I'm upset because I miss Sabrina.
Everything in here reminds me of her.
Because it is hers.
I miss my Sabrinie.
Sabrinie?
And so I've been rethinking this whole mortal high school thing.
Learning English as a second language, downing goose liver and snail sandwiches, no, thank you.
Sabrina, this doesn't sound like you.
Oh, really, don't you recognise my voice?
Are you unhappy here?
No, not at all.
It's just-- Well, I was supposed to go to this Britney Spears concert and-- Say no more.
You're so into me That I'm the only one you will see Tell me, I'm not in the blue Oh, that I'm not wasting My feelings on you This is so cool.
Every time I look at you My heart is jumping What can I do?
You drive me crazy I just can't sleep It's good to see you smile again.
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep Oh, crazy, but it feels all right Baby, thinking of you Keeps me up all night Okay, now it's just weird.
You're not enjoying this, are you?
No, it's great, it's just Well, it's not that much fun alone.
Tell me about it.
Like you'd know.
You're always surrounded by people.
And sometimes that's the loneliest place to be.
Maybe that's why I've been having these weird one-on-one dreams often.
They drive me crazy.
What am I supposed to do?
I can't tell my dad I wanna go back home.
Why not?
He needs to realise you're not fitting in.
And besides, you came here for all the wrong reasons.
Okay, we'll do it your way.
Right foot first.
- Easier, huh?
- Not really.
What do you mean, all the wrong reasons?
It sounds like to me that you're running away from your problems.
- Taking the easy way out.
- Taking the easy way out.
That's a great idea for a song.
Dibs on royalties.
Can I go home now?
Sure.
Thanks.
Great voice, but she really needs to work on the dance moves.
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, Dad, I need to talk to you too.
- I have to go to Pluto.
- You first.
A civil war has broken out there.
Unfortunately, that means I'm gonna be gone for quite a while.
Now, you're welcome to stay here with Gail and Donald, but I think you might be much happier-- - Back home.
- Yup.
Thanks.
Hello?
I'm home.
Where is everybody?
I can't believe Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda went out again.
Dad told them I was coming home.
Surprise.
Oh, welcome home, honey.
We missed you.
Sabrinie.
- Sabrinie?
- I'm so happy you're back.
- Put me down.
- Sorry.
I'm so glad to be back and I'm so glad you're glad I'm back.
There are paw prints in my cake.
When I'm happy, I eat.
Guess we can all thank that civil war on Pluto.
Is that what it was?
Would you excuse us for a moment?
But I want cake.
It's the other way.
Oh.
All right, spill.
Did you have anything to do with this civil war on Pluto?
Define anything.
Well, I might have made a few phone calls to some ne'er-do-well friends who owe me a favour or two.
But I only did it because I wanted Sabrina back.
You aren't gonna turn me in to the Witches' Council are you?
Well, something has to be done.
How about I fry you up a thick salmon filet?
All those years of warmongering and this is the first time anyone's ever said thank you.
I can't believe you're back.
I missed you so much.
I missed you too, but you have to let go or I can't get in my locker.
- Promise you won't go away again?
- I promise.
And promise you'll change your shirt.
Hey, Brad, look who's back.
Oh, hey, Sabrina.
Hi, Brad, thanks.
Paris was great.
I still don't get him.
- Hey, Brad.
- What's up, partner?
You've gotta start being nicer to Sabrina.
I said, "Hey, Sabrina".
But next time when you say, "Hey, Sabrina," you gotta say it like you mean, "Hey, Sabrina".
Man, you must really love this girl.
Yeah.
Don't tell coach.
Yep, this is gonna be the best year ever.
Miss Spellman, what are you doing back?
CRAZY" PLAYING.
] What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen anybody get jiggy before?
Now, this was fun even though we didn't get to see the show.
Well, yeah, but I almost heard one song.
This has been the best birthday ever.
Heh.
Hey, look, there she is.
Wow, Sabrina, she looked at you like she knew you.
Yeah.
In her dreams.
They shoot horses, don't they?
Baby, I'm so into you You got that something What can I do Baby, you spin me around Oh, the earth is moving But I can't feel the ground Every time you look at me My heart is jumping It's easy to see You drive me crazy I just can't sleep I'm so excited, I'm in too deep Oh, crazy, but it feels all right Baby, thinking of you Keeps me up all night
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Thirteen o'clock?
I'm late.
Aunt Zelda?
Aunt Zelda.
Oh.
Sorry.
Why the Pod of Privacy?
Because that stupid clock of Hilda's is driving me--  Exactly.
Hilda is pretending that piece of junk doesn't bother her, but this is one girl who can out-pretend her.
Oh, so you two have finally outgrown staring contests.
I knew that noise would get to you.
Blow it up, baby.
Bad audition?
My life needs a new direction.
I'm only 620 years old.
I need something more stimulating.
Well, if you've grown tired of the violin, a career change is a good idea.
Let me offer you a suggestion.
Fix that infernal clock.
Zelda, face it.
You are the only one that it bothers.
Salem, did you break my brand-new, handmade-in-Indonesia Swiss cuckoo clock?
Cuckoo.
Pff.
Oh, another protest?
Good grief, you stage one little rally against mildew in the locker room, and suddenly you're Che Guevara.
"Westbridge through the years".
Well, clearly, very little has happened in Westbridge through the years.
It's not finished yet.
I wanna be editor of the yearbook and this is my audition page.
A little maternal oohing and aahing might be appropriate now.
Sabrina, it might not be a good idea to take on too many extra activities this year.
Don't worry, Aunt Zelda.
I've taken on a new can-do attitude for my senior year.
Well, that's good, because this arrived from the Witches' Council this morning.
I've been chosen to mentor a witch student this year?
Yes, you have to guide and teach so they can get their witch's licence.
- I have to be somebody's quizmaster?
- No, mentor.
- What's the difference?
- Quizmasters get paid.
Fine.
I can help mould and shape someone's young mind and make them get me coffee.
- I like it.
- I'm off to the clock shop.
God, she really loves that clock, huh?
I know.
Sad.
What are you protesting?
Not another protest, Miss Spellman.
If we were in China, I could run you over with a tank.
This isn't a protest.
It's my audition page for yearbook editor.
See, "Westbridge through the years".
I'm gonna put pictures of past yearbooks here.
The theme of the yearbook is the same every year.
It is a bound chronicle of the misery that I've been put through during the previous nine months.
Okay, now I'm protesting.
Mr. Garcia, get the water hose.
Mr. Kraft, I know this may strike you as a walk on the wild side, but how about giving me a little support?
Well, since I'm the head of the faculty committee that selects the yearbook editor, you'll need it.
Okay, somewhere along the way, this conversation went terribly wrong.
I live for days like this.
- Oh!
- Oh.
Excuse me.
Did you write me the letter of recommendation for yearbook editor?
Okay, here's the question.
New NFL franchise, who do you pick?
- Barry Sanders.
- You're brain-dead.
Hello?
Letter of recommendation?
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
Last night kind of got away from me.
We're starting a new fantasy football league.
And I can't tell you how excited I am.
I need the letter.
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.
With that and Mr. Kraft's sudden death due to smallpox, I might make editor.
No!
Sorry.
You should be more careful.
I'm Dreama.
And I'm late.
Good luck with whatever you're protesting.
Power to the people.
You know, I love the violin.
But you can only play so much Mozart until you start to be glad he died young.
Travel clock, on the house.
So now I wanna do something bolder, more imaginative, more challenging.
- Wanna buy this place?
- Really?
Sure.
Wow, I never really imagined myself as a merchant.
Could I interest you in an alarm clock?
By golly, I'll do it.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm gonna buy a bar.
Talk about impulsive.
Hey, did you write that letter of recommendation at lunch?
I ate lunch at lunch.
To tell you the truth, the thought of writing it is giving me a knot in my stomach.
That's just the fish cakes.
Don't worry, it's just a little letter.
Nothing to feel pressured about.
I need it by tomorrow or all is lost.
Hi there.
Remember me?
I'm having flashbacks as we speak.
Okay.
What is the integral of the sine function of minus pi to pi, anyone?
Ooh!
Zero because sine is an odd function and the negative area cancels out the positive area.
Sabrina, could you get yourself organised so you can participate in the class, please?
Yes, sir.
You what?
- I bought a clock shop.
- Which clock shop?
- The one down by the market.
That shop?
It's in a terrible location.
No, it's not.
It took me five minutes to find.
In the last two years, that same spot has been a karate school, a nail salon, a yogurt shop, another nail salon, a Chinese restaurant, and a combination Chinese restaurant and nail salon.
So, what you're saying is, if things go well, I could sublet to a psychic.
Hilda, all those shops failed.
Well, mine isn't going to fail.
Mine is going to be a gigantic, colossal success.
I am going to be the Rolex of the clock world.
You don't know the first thing about clocks.
I know tons about clocks.
- What time is it?
- Eight-forty.
It's 10 after 2.
All right, so I put my watch on upside down, okay?
And it's 8:40 somewhere.
- Hi there.
- Hi back.
I've had days like that.
You are a day like that.
- What was that?
- Oh, a stomach rumble.
I had the fish cakes.
Oh, no, no, no, don't get interested in her, son.
That girl is poison.
Yeah, there is something strange about her, isn't there?
Something weird.
Hey, you know, I like you, boy.
You know the best way to fit into a new school other than just being, you know, Danno to my McGarrett?
Extracurricular activities.
And just at the moment, we are desperate to find a new editor for our yearbook.
Oh, well, I might be interested in a job like that.
Oh, that's great.
Fine.
Put the new kid in charge of our memories.
Harvey's gonna bring his parents' old yearbooks.
I'm gonna put pictures of old Westbridge students.
And these pictures are being brought by the same Harvey who can't remember to write a letter.
This editor thing is important to me.
So would you put a sock in it, Sergeant Negative?
Aye, aye, Captain Deluded.
Hey, maybe that's my witch student.
You're gonna teach some poor kid how to do ma-- I think it's marvellous.
Sabrina, your witch student is here.
Coming.
Don't get smart with me, mister.
Just practising.
It's a girl.
Oh, good because fish are so hard to train.
She's in there.
- Dreama?
You're my student?
- And you're my teacher?
This is incredible.
I'm so lucky.
Can I please go back to working on the family secret?
I got you a present.
Oh, dear, that was supposed to be flowers.
That's okay.
We don't have a vase.
Dreama's parents moved her here from the Other Realm so that you could help her.
She's a very bright girl, but she's neglected her magic.
Great.
Aunt Zelda, can I speak to you in private for a moment?
Remember my "can-do" attitude?
Gone.
She's a walking disaster.
Witches' Council has to pull another name out of the hat.
Dreama wasn't chosen for you at random.
Her name came from an intricately constructed, scientific hat.
I can't work with her.
Can't you see?
She'll kill me.
Sabrina, it's a mandate from the Other Realm.
You have to improve Dreama's magic or you'll lose your witch's licence and be deported.
It's something new and horrible every day, isn't it?
The Mortal Realm is so different from the Other Realm.
- I hope I can fit in.
- There are things to remember: One, I worked very hard to get my witch's licence.
Two, it means a lot to me.
Three, I have a hard time covering my own tracks, let alone yours.
Four or five, or wherever I am, no magic in front of mortals.
Okay, got it.
Hey, I don't care what you did at your old school.
Here, we do not celebrate Firecracker Tuesday.
So you meant magic of any sort?
Harvey.
Hey, did you bring the old yearbooks?
Uh-oh.
- Well, did you at least write the letter?
- Oh, man.
Brad came over and we rated every defensive back in the NFL.
Salem was right.
- Your cat?
- Don't change the subject.
I'll get the books at lunch, I promise.
At least I know that if Harvey was out with Brad last night, Brad couldn't have worked on his yearbook proposal.
Mr. Alcerro, now this is what I call a proposal.
- I'll say, whose is--?
- Nice work, Bradley.
Yes, you know, it's reassuring to see that some students can get their proposals in on time.
If I were you, I would start sharpening my editor's pencil.
- Hello?
Hi.
So I was wondering, are you ever gonna come down to my shop?
In other words, you're in way over your head and you need me to come down there and rescue you.
Something vaguely like that.
So we're not supposed to use our magic to do schoolwork even though you're a witch?
Hey, I thought we promised Dr. Fishman we weren't gonna name-call.
Here's another rule you need to know if you're gonna survive: Never let a mortal know you're a witch.
Okay.
But who's Dr. Fishman?
Yeah, this is a nice proposal.
I wish Brad would move back to Texas.
I'm assuming you meant to send Brad to Texas.
Well, while we're here, you wanna rustle up some grub?
Where did you come from?
I really think you need to have that conversation with your parents.
What did I say about magic in front of mortals, especially bad magic?
I'm sorry.
I've been doing this all my life.
I pull before I think.
I've gotta get to health class.
Mrs. Quick won't mind if I leave this here.
Sit.
Stay.
All Sabrina needs to do is fill in these blank spots with high school students from the past.
There's no mortals around.
To finish her poster Of Westbridge High Bring me the students Of years gone by Where are we?
Where's the radio?
We were listening to Jack Benny.
Uh-oh.
I'll have that fixed for you by Monday.
I just didn't say which Monday.
I bet you're kicking yourself now that you didn't get a piece of this when you had the chance.
You cannot possibly run this place by yourself.
And I am not coming down here every day to help you.
Okay, 25 percent.
But that's my final offer.
Oh, what a great grandfather clock.
Actually, it's a grandfather clock, but it appears to be a great one.
There's something odd about this clock.
What?
That it actually works?
- Let's check out the guts inside.
- No, wait.
Now I see why that guy wanted all cash.
Psst.
Go away.
Two minutes walking around and my legs should wake up.
You did magic, didn't you?
You think this has anything to do with the war?
Where am I?
Who are you?
Hilda, I hope you're happy.
You bought a magical lost-in-time clock.
Well, how was I supposed to know that that's what it was?
"Lost-in-time clock.
Persons who come through this clock are lost in time.
Whoever opens this portal must assist the time traveller or be turned into a clock themselves.
No excuses, no exceptions.
This means you".
Well, I guess that's what they mean by "buyer beware".
They said these things were safe.
- Well, now what do we do?
- I'm not sure.
See, you don't know any more about running a clock shop than I do.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You've gotta reverse the spell.
- I don't know how.
Let me try.
You don't know how to reverse your spells, but know how to seal them?
This isn't good news, is it?
I've read about lost-in-time people before.
They made a big mistake somewhere in their lives, and they have to go back so they can correct it.
Okay, Billy, what was the last thing that you remember doing?
Let's see.
I was in the big game, I was running for a pass, and I noticed my shoe was untied-- - That must be it.
- Right.
Okay, Billy, go back.
And this time, don't trip.
Oh, not as easy as it looks.
We've gotta get to my aunts.
Let's make a break for it.
Halt.
That's detention for everyone, including George and Mary Bailey here.
They're part of my yearbook proposal.
You know, a live, 3-D interactive presentation with kids from the Westbridge Players.
I don't like it.
Well, then I guess we'll have to return the costumes to the costume shop.
The fact that we don't have a costume shop doesn't even bother me.
Okay, the glue is on.
Thank goodness you remember dropping that pass.
Okay, Billy, go back there.
And this time, win one for The Gipper.
All right, well, we have that spare bedroom, don't we?
Oh, it's Sabrina and Dreama.
And two weird kids.
I've got a big problem.
- Cirque du Soleil?
- Football player.
He came through the clock.
So I can speak freely.
Oh, no, it's Brad.
You can help me send these people back to their homes, or you could help me fight the Witches' Council in a fiery apocalyptic showdown, whatever works for you.
We've got a little problem.
Brad's outside.
- Brad?
- Gretchen?
- Billy?
- You know each other?
We were in love, but I decided to play in the big game instead of taking her out for her birthday.
So I went out with John instead.
And you never thought about going out after the game?
Billy, that's why you're lost in time.
You've got to go back, skip the game and be with your girl.
You've gotta go out and make sure Brad doesn't come back here.
- Just show him some clocks.
- But if you sell one, no commission.
- Now let's let these guys 23 skidoo.
- Hilda, that's the '20s.
- Sorry, it looks like you lose out.
- Well, that's okay.
If you ever find yourself in 1946, look me up.
Toodle-oo.
Buy bonds.
So we've sent three very confused people back home through a clock.
Now all I have to do is come up with an excuse.
- Hilda, do you feel strange?
- Definitely.
What's that?
This Brad is the boy who dislikes you for no apparent reason?
That's right.
Bingo.
Witch hunter.
As in, hunts witches?
A very small amount of mortals are born with a witch-hunting gene that makes them wanna ferret out witches.
Something new and horrible.
Right on time.
Okay, so Harvey's best friend is trying to out me?
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He just senses magic and it makes him suspicious.
Yeah, the real danger comes when a witch inadvertently reveals herself to a witch hunter.
Then you get turned into a mouse for a hundred years.
So we have to be very careful.
Oh, well, we're always careful, and we'd never do magic around-- Dreama.
Maybe they're next door at the beef bowl.
No Dreama.
Goodbye licence, goodbye home.
Witch hunter, give me her.
- What?
- I'm so sorry.
Miss Spellman, do I have to add crimes against nature to your dossier?
I-- Dreama, thank goodness.
- Who am I holding?
- My science project.
Note the tumour.
You will be happy to learn the detention hall now serves a continental breakfast.
- Your girlfriend is weird.
- I know.
I've been looking for you for, like, an hour.
I have a pager.
Here's your vintage yearbooks and my heartfelt letter of recommendation.
You really wrote it?
With a little encouragement from Dreama.
She sat me down and told me to just write what I feel.
The first three drafts are about my stomachache.
This last one is straight from the heart.
"Sabrina Spellman is the nicest, smartest, most imaginative person I've ever met.
Pick her as yearbook editor and watch her work her magic".
Oh, Harvey.
Life's great when you're not annoyed with me.
So are you annoyed with me?
You're not very good with your magic, but you're a pretty good friend.
All this excitement has made me thirsty.
No!
Let's go over the rules again.
Well?
Well, Brad made yearbook editor.
- We can turn him into a chicken.
- Well, that's okay.
I'll have plenty to do mentoring Dreama.
- Did you get your clock fixed?
- Of course.
I run a clock shop.
Since Hilda has absolutely no experience fixing things, we had to improvise a little.
I'm not doing this all night.
I'm not working weekends, I'm taking holidays off.
- Salem.
- Cuckoo.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
We need an article about the basketball squad, and you're just the guy to write it, Harvey.
- It'll be fun.
- "It'll be fun".
I need to use the phone.
Wrap it up, lady.
Oh, that's just our lonely, crazy neighbour.
He came over to borrow more tinfoil for his hat.
Gah?
- I'll talk to you at school.
- Hey, it's my turn.
This isn't fair.
- Write a letter to PETA.
Yes, I'd like to order a dozen long-stem roses for Principal Willard Kraft at Westbridge High School.
Yes, I've met him.
- Roses?
Did he die?
- I just like him.
That's a shame now that he's passed on.
Well, enough with the "boohoo".
Pass me the phone.
- Hey.
- Why so anxious to talk on the phone?
I need to call into Nick Bakay's sports show on ESPN Radio.
All he ever talks about is the Buffalo Bills.
And his voice.
Lord, is it annoying.
Whatever Aunt Hilda's talking about is more important than that.
Yes, I'd like to reserve a floor buffer.
- Great, ciao.
Finally.
I tell you, I'm sick of being the only guy in a houseful of hens.
- Ugh!
- Ooh.
That's gonna cost you.
Gah?
Oh!
Turn me back.
Turn me back.
The Other Realm announced that they'll pay cash money for each empty potion bottle.
Got any?
You know, I have this strange ritual I perform with empty things.
I throw them away.
I'm sure there are some in the basement.
If there's half as much glassware as mouse droppings, this witch is Aruba-bound.
Why is it as soon as I get out all my winter clothes, we suddenly get stupid Indian summer?
I believe the correct term is "stupid Native American summer".
You're gonna get a break with this unseasonably warm weather, Sabrina.
Brad's witch-hunting gene will be dormant.
Yeah, besides the fact that you'll be wearing wool during a heat wave, should be an easy week.
Sabrina, you've got mail.
Maybe Valerie finally tore herself away from her new friends to write me.
Oh, great, Mr. Kraft just gave me detention over the computer.
- What did you do?
- Breathe.
You know, something has been bothering Willard lately.
I think I'm gonna have him over for lunch today.
Maybe some tuna salad and coleslaw will help him reveal his true feelings.
And I shall happily take refuge in the damp squalor we call a basement.
Aunt Zelda, I think it's a great idea to have Mr. Kraft over for lunch.
That'll be 45 minutes where he can't make my life miserable.
He's always nice to me.
- So have you heard from Valerie?
- Yeah, she's doing great.
Apparently Disneyland isn't the happiest place on Earth, Anchorage is.
Don't tell the people in Juneau.
Hey, I decided to do that sports article for you.
Great.
Let's talk money.
There is none.
Well, you got yourself a deal.
Except I'm gonna need some help writing it.
Oh, I'll be glad to help.
It'll be fun, and it'll take my mind off Valerie.
But I already asked Brad to help me.
- What?
- Don't worry, he's a great writer.
He won a contest in the second grade.
Oh, well, maybe you can fit his trip to Grandma's into the article.
What's up, guys?
Hey, so did you tell her about my idea yet?
Brad thinks we should interview the towel boys, promise anonymity, and get a real inside look at the team.
Yeah, that's an interesting idea, unfortunately.
We're on it.
What's that saying?
"Two's company, three's pathetic"?
Whenever Mr. Kraft talks, he spews verbal anthrax.
Valerie would've loved that line.
And I wouldn't be talking to myself right now.
Wasn't this a nice idea?
You get a home-cooked lunch, and we get a chance to talk.
- What is this, the Inquisition?
- Something's been bothering you.
Whoa-ho-ho.
Look at the time, I gotta run.
Those kids don't yell at themselves.
Well, at least let me put a sandwich in a bag for you.
Well, I do love tuna.
- I can't get Willard to talk.
- You've done wonders with him.
You think I should cast an Honest and Vulnerable Spell?
Yes, it'll make his feelings as open as his mouth is when he's chewing.
I'll do it.
- Here's your sandwich.
- Thank you.
Gotta run.
Are you sure you don't wanna tell me what's been bothering you?
It's Wally.
- Wally?
- My brother.
Sure, I got the good name, but he got everything else: looks, charm, a personality.
Now he's coming to visit.
Well, so you'll put up with him for a few days and then say goodbye to Perfect Pete.
No, it's "Wally".
And you don't understand.
He's stolen every girlfriend I've ever had and many that I just claimed to have.
Oh, Willard, you're not worried?
Well, you're just-- You're so breathtakingly beautiful.
- He's gonna wanna steal you.
- Oh, you're so vulnerable.
And so honest.
How did it go?
- Wonderfully.
Did you remove the spell?
No, I like him honest and vulnerable.
Besides, what could it hurt?
And sometimes when I sleep at night, I am so consumed with self-doubt that I suck my thumb.
Okay, this is new, getting sick before lunch.
Oh, hey, Brad and I are having a blast with that article.
Thanks for making me do it.
Sure, anything to bring you and Brad closer together.
If that's my novel, heh-heh, the character Tabrina is really a composite.
This is Harvey and Brad's article.
It took them all of homeroom to write it, so it's gotta be good.
Hey, leave the sarcasm to the professionals.
You know, I really should be supportive of Harvey and give Brad the benefit of the doubt.
But I bet this article really bites.
Oh, man.
I haven't read sports writing this good since the glory days of Jimmy Cannon.
Oh, what would you know?
So the phrases are witty and the metaphors are imaginative.
- It's still bad writing.
- Yeah, Pulitzer-bad.
Bye, monkey.
So it's settled.
Willard and his brother are coming to dinner, and I'm going to show him that I'm immune to Wally's charms.
Too bad you're not immune to Willard.
My, but you have found a lot of empty potion bottles.
Not really.
Suddenly I remembered, we're witches.
One point and we've got more empties than Boris Yeltsin's trash can.
Hilda.
"Attention: Redeeming magically reproduced bottles will result in a heavy fine and unreachable itching".
- Good.
- Does Big Brother never sleep?
"No".
- So you wanna join us for dinner?
- No, thanks.
I'd rather wade through ankle-deep dust and breathe bacteria-laden spores than eat with two Krafts.
- So you'll be in the basement?
- Until I can afford Aruba.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
No, if you won't respect my opinion that this writing is garbage, maybe you'll believe some professionals.
- Mr. Twain?
- Quite amusing.
- Oh, stop breathing steamboat fumes.
- This essay's the thing.
Oh, like you really wrote any of your own plays.
Miss Dickinson?
- This shows real talent.
- Shut-in.
Uh-oh.
You're making the sound witches make when jealousy is percolating.
I am not jealous.
I mean, just because Harvey has a new best friend who he likes more than me, and his new friend is more talented than I am, and my old best friend is in Alaska with her new best friend, big deal.
I thought I was your best friend.
Sabrina, are you percolating with jealousy?
No, I'm bubbling over with ideas.
You have to be careful, honey, you could develop jealotosis, a condition where jealousy gets out of control.
- Well, that doesn't sound very good.
- You can fight it.
All you have to do is be very happy for the person you're jealous of.
So I have to accept that Harvey has a new best friend and be happy for him.
I can do that.
I can be happy for him.
- Well, good.
- How happy?
Hey, Sabrina, did you read our article?
I still have to look at it, but I'm happy for you.
If it's too short, let us know because while we were at the arcade, Brad thought up a couple more great jokes.
I'm happy for you.
If I sometimes seem irritable, it's because I have inoperable haemorrhoids.
I'm happy for you.
Come on, Harv, let's go work on our Government project together.
I really was happy for Mr. Kraft.
- Sabrina.
- Oh, uh Just wearing the shades to be cool.
Nothing to be concerned about.
Oh, that must be Willard and Wally.
No, no, no, even at my age, the right pacifier can be really comforting.
- Stop revealing these things to me.
- Oh, dear, the Vulnerability Spell.
But in the deepest depths of my soul, I still believe that-- That was some football game on Sunday, huh?
Yeah, well, here goes.
- Zelda, Wally.
Wally, Zelda.
- You sold her short, Willard.
She's more beautiful than a Monet painting.
Oh, my, my.
You are the second-most charming Kraft I've ever met.
- You've met Mother.
- Oh-ho-ho.
And it starts.
Someone has stolen our potions-- Oh, I'm sorry.
I overdressed.
And who is this dust storm of enchantment?
Hilda.
But you can call me "dust storm of enchantment".
WALLY AND  Ha-ha-ha.
- Hilda, - I'd like you to meet my brother.
- Some other time.
Right now I'd like to get to know this cutie.
Heh.
I think he likes her.
Yes.
I'm happy for them.
Sabrina, you woke me up.
Whatever happened to quiet desperation?
I have to find a spell but can't see anything.
Well, remove the shades, Miss Pulp Fiction.
Dear Lord, you're green with envy.
You have jealotosis.
Jealousy will take over you and your world.
All is lost.
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Here it is.
"The cure to jealotosis: Jealousy must run its natural course".
Ugh.
Since when did this book start taking a holistic approach to magic?
Maybe all you need is a good night's sleep.
Right, and tomorrow I'll wake up and be happy for Harvey and Brad.
Behold, the first envy-powered night-light.
Is the glow gone?
- You know what?
I am so sick of Harvey and his friend Brad always laughing, having fun, making plans.
On the plus side, heh, you look rested.
You know, Dreama's not even around for me to hang out with.
But you know what?
I'm a witch.
I can have any best friend I want.
Tara Lipinski.
What's going on?
I was at the rink, and now-- You're my new best friend.
Come on, let's get ready for school.
Now I have no reason to be jealous of anyone.
Hey, gold-metal girl, show me a triple Lutz.
Hey, she's my friend, not yours.
Don't you wanna ask about last night?
Didn't you notice how Wally and I really hit it off?
No, not really.
You know, when I'm with Willard, I can't help but shut out the rest of the world.
Well, the feeling is mutual on the part of the rest of the world.
Anyway, Wally and I have so much in common.
He loves literature, art, science-- You have no interest in those subjects.
I do now.
Wally's gonna take me to the van Gogh exhibit.
You're kidding.
I've been hinting to Willard to take me there.
But the Babylon 5 convention should be culturally enriching.
Well, I'm off to school with my new best friend, Tara Lipinski.
Can't believe he's taking you to van Gogh.
Attention, everyone, all detention is cancelled because:  My brother didn't steal my gal Man, I've never seen Mr. Kraft so happy.
You weren't here last year for the public caning.
Oh, yeah, laugh all you want, but I've got a new best friend now too.
Tara Lipinski.
I'm in love.
Wow.
It's great having a best friend.
There's so many places we can go where I can stand off to the side while everyone pays attention to her and she doesn't even notice I'm alive.
Wally and I just had the most divine lunch at Chez Maurice.
You and Willard have probably never been there, because there's no drive-through.
Willard and I had a very nice lunch today.
The food at Custer's has improved.
I didn't even chip a tooth this time.
Did I show you the flowers Wally brought me?
Willard and I have a relationship that's so strong, he doesn't need to give me presents.
Oh, really?
Oh.
What's this, then?
"Zelda, keep this handy for the next monster-truck show".
Give me that.
Sabrina, even though I'm in the middle of a psychotic episode, I liked your friends, especially Brad.
Oh, yeah, everyone likes Brad, everyone likes you.
Well, you know what?
You can just find yourself a new best friend.
Sabrina, would you remove your dark glasses, dear?
Oh, I would, but it's like a tanning salon in here.
Sabrina.
Oh, no, you've got full-blown jealotosis.
Or a lousy brand of contacts.
I know.
I'm gonna hide away in your room.
- My room?
- It's better than my little dinky one.
Oh, wow, this is a bad case if she's envying your decor.
Sabrina, you can't hide away.
Jealotosis can't run its course unless you're out in public encountering people who have things you want.
Wow, you know so much.
I envy that.
Stop.
Honey, when you're older, it'll be easier to control your jealousy.
Oh, like the way you're controlling your jealousy over my relationship with Wally?
Oh, I'm afraid you're confusing jealousy with pity.
Why don't I have someone to argue with?
Sabrina, go back to school and envy someone your own age.
Cool outfit.
See?
That was good.
I wasn't jealous at all.
I got an A. I got an A. Hey, why should you get an A and not me?
- You're not in the class?
- Right.
And I didn't even wanna be in that class.
And I'm not jealous of you a bit.
Not a bit.
- Hi, Sabrina.
- You seem happy.
I don't wanna be happy.
That's not something I crave.
- You read the article?
- Yeah, but I'm not publishing it.
Ha!
There.
Now you're not so happy anymore, are you, SeÃ±or Happy?
Now you got nothing I want.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Don't try to act innocent with me.
I saw you cosying up to the lunch lady.
What does it for you, support hose?
- Ah.
Are you okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?
I'm a better writer than Brad, and I look better in a hairnet than Mrs. Hornbuckle.
What's the matter, jealous?
I don't care if you have a secret.
I don't like secrets.
What's the secret?
I'm really glad that you and Hilda have hit it off because she never cared much for me.
Well, that's what's great about my relationship with her.
We seem to agree on everything.
Why should Mr. Kraft have a best friend and not me?
Why should he get to be happy and not me?
Why does he--?
Oh, no.
I'm jealous of Mr. Kraft.
Salem, where am I?
Congratulations, Sabrina, you're in the Jealous Sea.
The Jealous Sea?
I didn't come up with the name, I just work here, so get off my back.
Well, what is this place?
It's your kind of place, a place where you have everything and everyone else has nothing.
My classmates, what happened to them?
Good news.
They all had to drop out of school.
Now they've entered the exciting field of menial labour.
Now you will be the only one to get good grades.
That's not good news, I didn't-- Hey, you missed a spot.
- What am I saying?
So cold.
No clothes, no job, no food, and this barrel's a rental.
Mr. Kraft.
Can't we do something for him?
Not mention that the barrel makes him look heavy?
Anyway, you can't be happy as long as he's happy, right?
But Harvey.
Sabrina, I don't have a best friend anymore.
So quit your bellyaching.
You still have Sabrina.
Yeah, but it was kind of nice having a best friend too.
I'm gonna miss him.
I know, that's exactly how I felt when Valerie moved away.
I don't want you to go through that too.
- Salem, do something.
- This is what you wanted.
I didn't want this.
Oh, why couldn't I have just been happy for Harvey?
Yeah, and why can't I find better work than being a know-it-all in a subconscious daydream?
- Dream?
- Sabrina?
Sabrina, are you okay?
If everyone has what they want, it doesn't diminish what I have.
- Absolutely.
Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.
No, really, think about it.
If everyone else has great stuff, it doesn't take away the things I have.
I'm happy to hear you say that.
Let's go to the nurse.
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Can I have everyone's attention?
I apologise for the way I've been behaving.
And I want you all to get good grades and not become janitors, unless the custodial work is your passion.
Oh, Brad, I'm gonna publish the article that you and Harvey wrote.
- It's excellent.
- Why did you reject it before?
Running a newspaper is a very complicated business, but mainly, I was just being a jerk.
- I gotta go apologise to Mr. Kraft now.
- Okay, that's it.
You're going to the nurse.
I just heard from the Other Realm.
Sabrina's back from the Jealous Sea, and her jealotosis is gone.
Oh, good.
Do you remember when we were teenagers and the Jealous Sea had the best Club Med?
Yeah, it's also made me remember that a person can be happy for others - without diminishing what she has.
- Uh-huh.
And I just wanna say that I've been acting jealous, and I'm sorry.
I want you and Wally to have a great time tonight.
Thanks, Zellie.
I'm sure we'll enjoy the ballet.
I mean, handsome men in tights, how bad can it be?
Ha-ha.
- The ballet?
- Uh-huh.
I mentioned that to Willard months ago, and I get nothing.
I'm glad I didn't tell you we have orchestra seats.
Oh, let me guess.
This is the way mature witches handle their jealousy.
I can't believe I blew like that.
What is your problem?
Do you wanna date Wally?
No, I'm not jealous because he likes you.
I'm jealous because Wally takes you to all the places I want Willard to take me.
I may be a younger, less mature witch, but it seems that if you want Mr. Kraft to take you places, instead of waiting for him to ask you, why don't you ask him?
You're right.
I'm going to.
I'm going to ask Willard Kraft to the ballet.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Harvey.
Hey, I understand the article you and Brad wrote was a big hit.
People seemed to like it.
Like it?
You should've seen he and Brad walk into class.
It was like Lillian Hellman walking into Sardi's after The Little Foxes.
So you ready to start the next one?
Yeah, let's go get Brad and start brainstorming.
You know what?
Do you think just the two of us could work on this one?
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know if you're aware of it, but Brad and I have been spending a lot of time together lately.
Really?
Heh.
I hadn't noticed.
- So how was your date with Harvey?
- Great, we went to the Slicery.
All of our friends were there, most of them at our table, so we're gonna ease into the "spending time alone" thing.
- How was your date with Wally?
- Well, he's not really my type.
We didn't have that much in common, and I really don't like his cologne.
- So are you going out again?
- Tuesday.
I just finished an experiment.
Thought I'd save you the potion bottle.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, I thought you were gonna cash those in for a trip.
I was, and then I remembered, I'm a witch.
I'll be back when I get a tan.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
The gall of that creep.
He's selling watches right outside my clock shop.
It would be one thing if he sold those fried cinnamon sticks, but he's in direct competition with you.
You have to admit, it's kind of funny.
In a morally bankrupt sort of way.
I'm gonna go out there and show him that the little hand is on the 2, and the big hand is on his face.
Hilda, come on, now.
Calm down.
I'm sure if we call the authorities, they'll ask him to move along.
And he's got one of those little monkeys.
What a pathetic way to attract attention.
Hey, maybe you wouldn't have such a hard time selling clocks if you had some of that monkey's charm.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Or maybe if you did.
- Like I'd ever do that.
Like they even make little bellhop suits for cats.
Oh, that's right, you're a witch.
I'll be back with your towels and ice.
Hilda, I gotta tell you, I think we should wait for the city to take action against that watch hustler.
No, they'll take forever to crack down.
I'm telling you, this is a better plan.
I'm gonna beat that little dancing monkey at his own game.
Play it, Sam.
The humiliation is only eclipsed by the chafing.
You'll do anything to avoid the draft, won't you?
Hey, this is great.
Is someone offering us a big-screen TV just to look at Other Realm condos?
Almost as good.
Grandma wants to visit.
Can we be home this time?
Oh, please, no.
Not Mother and her little bag of sleights.
She can help me with my sociology homework.
I have to trace the family tree.
I don't know where to put my uncles with the goat-boy genes.
Sabrina, dear, for us, time spent with Mother is bittersweet.
More like bitter-bitterer.
But I haven't seen my grandma in ages.
Can't you give her a chance for me?
Well, Mother does know about the family tree.
I guess I don't need maternal nurturing.
I have a nearly successful clock shop.
So we'll do it for Sabrina.
Whoo-hoo.
I see some hard candy in my future.
And I promise, this will be her best visit ever.
We're doing the right thing.
And I can keep it together until Mother leaves.
- Stop that!
- Gah!
I still don't see how doing a genealogy study is gonna get me into the college of my choice.
Oh, maybe you'll find a long-lost relative who donated Harvard's sitcom wing.
The real problem is, I don't have time to work on it.
My parents are making me babysit three afternoons a week.
They're not even going out.
Think that's fair?
Only if they compensate you by extending the curfew of your choice.
Oh, that's brilliant.
Where would I be without your cool, rational thinking?
Home by 10.
I love all this old family stuff.
Hey, Grandma, did you find those pictures down there?
Got them.
Give me a hand, would you, dear?
Oh.
Oh, and I found Hilda's baby violin.
- Did I ever tell you she was a prodigy?
- Oh, only every time you mention her.
But these dresses are the real prize.
Zelda and Hilda got so much attention when they wore them.
Two of those walking down the road towards me would certainly turn my head.
It's great that you brought Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda's stuff.
Oh, they're my daughters.
I adore them.
Especially in those dresses.
Oh, they were so cute, you just wanted to squish them.
- Hi.
We're home.
We were just talking about you.
Zelda.
Oh.
Hilda.
Oh.
I just love your hair.
Big hugs and a compliment, not too shabby.
It's so much nicer than the way you used to wear it.
Oh.
You mean the way I wore it for a whole century?
Hmm.
Seemed longer.
Oh, and, Zelda, congratulations on your latest Ph.D. Oh, thanks, Mom.
It took a lot of hard work.
Yes, a Ph.D. - Still no M-R-S?
- No, Mom.
No husband.
Just a chance to use my silly knowledge to change the world.
We've had a lot of fun looking through this old trunk.
We found Aunt Hilda's baby violin.
Oh, yes, all those violin lessons.
Now, that was money well-spent.
But the cotillion, well, that was a dead end, huh?
Okay, enough about that.
We found this picture of you when you were little girls on some farm.
Now, that, my friends, is what I call a happy memory.
That was a nice time.
Yes, it was.
I wasn't married then either.
Oh, Hilda, look how pretty you are when you smile.
Ever thought of doing that again?
Oh!
Well, this has been just great.
But I am late for that thing.
Oh, that thing.
Me too.
Catch you in a hundred years, Mom.
I sense some tension.
Tell me the truth, they're not getting along, are they?
They just need to remember some happy memories.
Hard candy?
Grandma.
Oh, thank goodness we have your shop to escape to.
I know.
I hope Mother never finds out I gave up the violin to buy it.
You'll never hear the end of it.
The violin is the only thing I ever heard her praise you for.
If by "praise" you mean statements like, "That's enough.
Go play with your friends.
Oh, it's bedtime".
This belonged to that cad, the Earl of Sandwich.
Oh, he had the biggest crush on my Zelda.
But she refused to be another notch on his epaulette.
My girls always followed their hearts.
That's wonderful.
Why don't you tell them that?
How about now?
We'll go see them at the clock shop, and you-- Wait, wait.
- Did you say "clock shop"?
- Yeah.
Aunt Hilda bought her own clock shop.
Now she owns her own business.
So she gave up the violin?
Actually, she blew it up.
Talk about following your heart, huh?
Excuse me.
Grandma?
Oh, this can't be good.
Hello.
Would you like to buy a clock?
Oh, no, thanks.
I just bought a Rolex from the monkey.
- Do you have a restroom?
- Out.
Out.
You primate frequenter.
Shoo!
- Hilda, we are also primates.
- Where is Salem?
He's supposed to be attracting business by looking cute in the window.
I'll check the back.
Aha.
Salem, what are you doing down there?
The capuchin just made another sale.
I don't want people to see me this way.
And I think that monkey's riddled with Ebola.
Grandma?
Grandma?
Did you go in the kitchen and make a sandwich?
Did you finish your sandwich, and now you need a nap?
Look what Sabrina zapped to us.
We did have one great summer on that farm.
Yeah.
I don't remember fighting with Mother at all.
Either that, or I'm repressing a horrible memory.
I just think it's a shame that you aren't witches with a magic clock that would allow you to bring someone back from the past, from, say, a farm, who would help you remember.
Good idea.
I could have done without the sarcasm, but good idea.
Let's find someone to help us understand Mother.
Let's not get snagged in the fact that, once again, the children are asked to heal the parent.
Grandma?
Remember we were gonna tell your daughters how much you love them?
Grandma?
Okay.
I've lost Grandma.
You must be careful not to bring Mother back from the past.
The one in the present is all I can handle.
Mom's here, and it's a bummer Bring us a friend From that happy farm summer  Pinky, the pet pig.
Oh.
I don't think we're gonna get any answers, unless he's been hanging around with Arnold Ziffel.
Okay, okay.
Not bad.
Hey, a monkey.
Hang in there, baby.
Oh-ho-ho.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Salem, I hate to tell you this, but Ed Sullivan's been off the air for years.
- Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda?
Back here.
Joe Franklin's still interested.
Nice pig.
Yes, but he refuses to get back inside the magic clock.
Oh, well, maybe the clock's kosher.
By any chance, have you seen Grandma?
No.
She doesn't know about this place.
She does now.
I told her Aunt Hilda gave up her violin for the clock shop.
- How could you?
- I don't know.
It never occurred to me that what you do for a living might be a secret.
- Anyway, I can't find her.
Hilda Spellman?
I found her.
She said wonderful things about you, and I think she'd like to share them.
But first, we have to get through this crisis.
Okay.
Say, "I should've told you about the shop.
I couldn't be sorrier".
- Got it?
- Got it.
Okay.
Remember, "Couldn't be sorrier".
Go.
I went home and got these.
Bills.
Do you know what I've spent on 200 years of violin lessons?
About two-thirds of what I've spent on 300 years of therapy, you controlling, control-freak controller.
Did you hear "sorry"?
Well, that's interesting information.
People, people, what we have here is an opportunity for truth and growth.
- I never knew you felt so dominated.
- Veal have more autonomy.
I receive your meaning loud and clear, and I won't be bothering you again.
I'm going home.
Go after her.
Look, she's still outside buying a watch from the monkey.
Sabrina, I think you've gotta face it, we're never going to get along.
This is just the way our family is.
On the bright side, this was one of the nicest visits we've ever had.
I am not giving up.
Maybe if I show Aunt Hilda all the things of hers that Grandma saved, she'll realise she really cares.
Wow.
I never knew this.
How could you be so unforgiving to your mother who loved you enough to adopt you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not adopted.
It says right here that-- I was adopted?
- I'm adopted?
- I thought you knew.
- I'm adopted?
- Hey, that made things better.
Well, being adopted certainly explains my feelings of rootlessness and emptiness.
I didn't know you felt rootless and empty.
Well, why would you?
You and Mother obviously don't share my genetic tendency towards empathy.
Oh, this is silly.
A piece of paper doesn't change who your family is.
Yeah, what really matters is how you feel.
Okay.
I feel awful.
- I don't know who I am.
- You're my Aunt Hilda.
You're Aunt Zelda's sister.
You're Salem's frequent foil.
Wait a minute, Hilda.
Come here.
Oh, no.
I've gone from "Who am I"?
to "Where am I"?
What happened to her reflection?
It's gone.
This is the first symptom of a very serious condition.
Hilda's lost her identity.
And when a witch loses their identity, they eventually disappear.
"Disappear" like the Invisible Man, or "disappear" like we visit once a year and bring flowers?
I got a bad feeling it's the latter.
- We gotta do something.
- Right.
Sabrina, you go see what you can find out from the Other Realm adoption records.
I'll track down Mother and get the whole story.
- What about me?
- You stay here in your clock shop, where you can cling to your identity as a clock merchant.
An identity shrouded in failure.
Oh, but I do feel bad.
We haven't fed the pig.
I'll take whatever information you can give me.
- Name?
- Sabrina Spellman.
Oh, you mean the name of the adopted one.
Hilda Spellman.
- Zelda Spellman?
- No, Hilda Spell-- Wait a minute.
What's Aunt Zelda's name doing in there?
She was adopted into the Spellman family.
Aunt Zelda and Aunt Hilda were both adopted?
Heh.
And yet none of this was the family secret.
What'd you find out?
If I can find Aunt Zelda's adoption papers, maybe Hilda will listen to her.
Zelda was adopted?
- Ah.
Got them.
- Burn them.
Destroy them.
Buy a shredder and put it on my card.
Salem, relax.
This is a good development.
- Zelda's stable.
She's a scientist.
- Okay.
She understands that family is who loves you, - not whose genes you have.
- Okay.
Maybe her attitude will rub off on Hilda.
- Okay.
I'm back.
Anybody home?
Get ready for a clinic in things going well.
Okay.
Mother is in neither realm.
I looked everywhere.
Even the Red Lobster.
Did you have any luck?
Oh, well, I have some pretty good news.
Maybe Sabrina's right.
She'll tell Zelda, and Zelda will help Hilda, and everyone will be healed.
I'm off to the clock shop to see if it will help with my feelings of rootlessness and emptiness.
Oh, dear.
No reflection?
Oh, no, no.
"Zelda's stable.
She's the scientist.
Zelda's stable.
She's the scientist".
I hope that little routine was worth a lifetime - without tummy rubs.
- Gah?
I'm adopted too.
You can never let me have my moment, can you?
- This is all my fault, and I have to fix it.
- Yes.
I would suggest you get help from your family, but you've managed to dissolve that.
Aunts are adopted.
Father's probably adopted.
You got a grandmother that Lord knows if you're even related to.
You're right.
- Who am I, anyway?
- Don't go there.
But it's so sad.
Little Sabrina has no family.
Where'd all this emotion come from?
Oh, no, you're questioning your identity.
And since you're part mortal, instead of disappearing, part of your personality will fade.
- Which part?
- Apparently, the rational part.
Oh, no, someone's at the door.
It could be Death, or someone really icky.
We'll never know until someone answers it.
And you're the only one here with hands.
Right.
Okay, you can do it.
You can do it.
I can't do it.
Do it.
Hey.
Could I hit you up for some more of that cool, logical thinking?
Harvey, I thought I'd never see you again.
- Are you having eye problems?
- I am?
Let's start over.
I'm upset about my family tree.
I'm back four generations.
The only thing I've learned about the Kinkle clan is we're all exterminators.
- Dear Lord, no!
- Bad exterminators, Sabrina.
My great-great-grandfather killed rats with a stone.
My family stinks.
Oh, but they're your family, and family's what matters.
- Godspeed, Harvey Kinkle.
- Right-o.
Okay.
I have an identity.
I'm Sabrina.
I have two aunts who need me.
These memories might help.
Hey, I'm being pretty rational.
A nameless teddy bear I have no connection to?
When I get back, I'm naming you.
Dear God, please patch up my family and make them as good-- No, make them better than they were before.
One of the ways you might improve us: wet food for the cat.
If you see fit to answer this prayer, please send me a simple yet unmistakably clear sign.
Let coins rain down on the kitchen table.
Okay.
Plan B. Okay, it appears said watch salesman is down the block.
Step outside, make a positive ID, and the system will take it from there.
He's the one with the monkey.
How hard can that be?
- Are you refusing to identify the man?
- I can't even identify myself.
- We could draw you a picture.
- You change your mind, you call me.
Why didn't you identify monkey man?
We thought the fact that we are slowly disappearing into nothingness might give the officer pause.
Okay.
This is making me really emotional.
Must stay strong.
I'm Sabrina, the girl with the disappearing aunts.
- What's this?
- A reminder of who you are and how much your mother loved you.
Now I have to get back to the Other Realm.
Never surrender.
Maybe this will help.
- Aah!
- Oh, not those dresses.
Oh.
Oh, remember how Mother used to insist we wear them?
"Oh, you look so cute.
Just like twins".
Like huge, galumphing, yellow twins.
There's one thing I've always wanted to do.
- Ha-ha.
- Oh, I'll never forget the time you covered for me when my dress was inadvertently smeared with bacon grease and set aflame.
Remember how you took the blame when mine was "accidentally" exposed to gamma rays?
Heh-heh.
Those were good times, despite the radiation.
That's because we were always there for each other.
That's right.
- Hey, Hilda, you're not faded anymore.
- Neither are you.
Well, I guess no matter who our parents were, or weren't, we are sisters.
Hmm.
Who just happened to have a crazy mother - who we can be glad didn't spawn us.
- Ha-ha.
Hickory, Dickory, Clock.
We've always got time for you.
Get your non-reflecting butts home, stat.
And I would never ask a highly ethical person, like yourself, to bend the rules if it wasn't a matter of life and disappearance.
Actually, we don't seal the adoption records in this realm.
Give me.
What are these vermin-infested animals doing here?
And more importantly, why aren't there newspapers down?
I borrowed Popo and his little friends as a visual aid.
So listen and learn.
Like you ladies, these animals do not live with their biological parents.
They are all adopted.
But they aren't whining and they aren't fading, because they are loved.
And so are you.
Even if your mother is a crazy shrew.
You're absolutely right, Salem.
Don't call Mother a shrew.
She's a nutcase.
Now would you be so kind as to peer into yonder mirror?
Should we tell him we're already back to normal?
Why spoil his moment?
- Hallelujah, we're healed.
- It's a miracle.
Still waiting on those coins, big guy.
Trouble deciding what to have for lunch?
- Hey, you guys are whole again.
- Because we know who we are.
A loving, unrelated-by-blood family.
And we have you to thank for it.
I thought you had me to thank.
Sabrina, when you gave us those dresses, you really helped us reconnect with ourselves.
So did you wanna meet the biological mother I brought back?
- Mother?
- I suppose I owe you an explanation.
- Sit down, dears.
- This ought to be rich.
Well, your sister Vesta was terribly jealous of all the attention you got when you were little.
So being the scamp that she is, she turned your father and me into pigs.
Go, Vesta.
The Witches' Council decided people with pigs' feet couldn't raise children.
So when Vesta refused to turn them back-- - You adopted us out.
- To a nice family in the country.
- No wonder we loved that farm.
- She wasn't there.
Oh, no, your father and I lived in the barn.
Actually, Dad got very good at working an Instamatic with his snout.
Heh.
That's right.
You found us those truffles.
Then, one month later, we finally got Vesta to turn us back.
Grandma head-butted her.
Well, to get you back legally, we had to adopt you, hence, the papers in the trunk.
So when you had the choice, you still wanted us.
- You like us.
You really like us.
- Oh, of course I do.
Oh.
Oh.
Well, now that that's all settled, can we discuss why neither one of you has called me in the last week?
Excuse me, Mother, but the moment hasn't shifted back to you yet.
We almost disappeared.
Come on, guys, think about those fun times on the farm.
- Sabrina-- - With all due respect-- Butt out.
Yep, without a doubt, this has been the best visit ever.
You're sure Pinky's not the pig your father was in the past?
No.
Dad had a much curlier tail.
- A much stronger odour.
- Mother, one question.
All that old stuff in that trunk, and yet you threw out my old Vogues.
Oh.
If you're here to get me to press charges, I've had a change of heart.
That little monkey has to eat too.
Actually, the fellow with the bargain watches filed a complaint.
I'm here to cite you for unregistered livestock.
- It is swine-flu season.
- What?
Well, at least we have something to talk about at the next reunion, huh?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
This is gonna be the best community charity drive ever.
Yeah, every business on Water Street working together to help the victims devastated by the hurricane in Honduras.
And all other businesses are gonna be devastated by the success of our bake sale.
Yep, that's what charity's all about.
Winning.
Oh, look at my cuticles.
Not that they matter, compared to the plight of the Hondurans.
An armadillo?
A goldfish?
- How about an iguana?
- Things that taste better deep-fried?
No, Salem is badgering me to let him get a pet.
A pet for Salem?
But he's childish, irresponsible, scatterbrained Mm-hm.
By the way, I found your keys in the front door.
And the notebook you lost in the dryer.
But I don't want a pet.
Cool, my first credit card.
And no bills.
And a lot of catalogues.
I have been specially chosen for unbridled consumption.
And it makes a really cool noise when you swipe it.
Sabrina, I have to warn you.
If you get anything and everything you want, you'll never learn to appreciate the things that are important in life.
Exactly, that's why I think you should use it to get me a pet.
I'll take a llama.
I'm gonna be very responsible with this card and a pet is not something you need, however This is a necessity.
I'm not enjoying this.
This new sweater looks even better on than it did in the Other Realm catalogue.
Sabrina, I'm serious about this credit card.
Be careful.
Witches are very susceptible to get-itis.
Get-itis, you mean what mortal children get on Christmas morning?
Exactly, you don't appreciate anything, because you keep thinking each new item will bring you happiness.
This isn't my first time at the cauldron, you know.
I got a sweater because it's sweater weather.
And that doesn't mean it can't be stylish-sweater weather.
Okay, I hope they give you frequent-flier miles for rationalisations.
You know, sometimes I think she has no faith in me.
But I totally appreciate this new sweater.
And the fact that it comes in 37 festive fall colours.
And she said this wouldn't make me happy.
Although I'd be a lot happier if I had shoes to match.
I look so cute, but now I need a horse.
Oh, advertisers will do anything to catch the elusive teen market.
"Can't you hear me crying in the attic?
Salem".
- Ah, there it is.
Come comfort me.
I'm busy.
Then I guess I'll just have to dry my tears on this stack of brand-new catalogues.
- Give me.
- Made you run.
- Salem, what are you doing up here?
- Playing the pity card.
I want a pet.
I want something to play with.
Something to give me unconditional love the way I do for you.
Oh, so you're thinking of something in the disease family?
Hey, my old jewellery box.
Look, it's the charm bracelet my grandma gave me.
I was afraid I lost it.
Touching.
And it's going to get me a pet how?
Salem, everything I know about manipulation I learned from you.
You're sweet.
What's your point?
Stop asking Aunt Zelda for a pet.
Move on to Miss Pushover, Aunt Hilda.
And the student becomes the teacher, the circle of life is complete.
Be careful, Sabrina.
Don't do that, Sabrina.
Why am I always the one who has to say no?
You're the mean one?
You're right.
I'll handle the next problem that arises.
- Thank you.
- Look who I found alone in the attic.
Now that reminds me.
We really have to get up there and clean out all that useless old junk.
I'm right here.
And, look, I found my old charm bracelet.
Sabrina, it's beautiful.
And I'm sure you appreciate it even more because you didn't just zap it in with your new credit card.
Can I have a pet?
No.
- Please?
- Oh, okay.
- Hilda.
- Oh, lighten up.
Who cares if Salem gets a pet?
So what if Sabrina zaps in a couple of things from the Other Realm?
- It's not the end of the world.
- Thank you, Aunt Hilda.
- Wanna ride on my new Vespa?
- You don't have a Vespa.
Do now.
It's still not the end of the world.
So do you think I can do wheelies on my new Vespa?
Maybe I'll get a wild boar.
I always thought the end of the world would involve more locusts.
And we'll be holding our rummage sale at that cute coffee place on Water Street.
So if there are no further questions, let's get it on.
And read Chapter 11.
That's cute.
That's what I need, a day planner.
Ah.
Great.
Okay, now all I need is some plans.
Um Oh, buy more stuff.
Sabrina, I know I don't need to ask, but would you be my assistant at the rummage sale?
Sure.
Buy rummage-sale outfit.
Oh, what a lovely charm bracelet.
Oh, isn't it great?
My grandma gave it to me.
Oh, a PalmPilot.
That's much better than my stupid day planner.
I had a charm bracelet when I was a little girl.
Every time my father went away on a business trip, he brought me a new charm.
Mother used to call it my little guilt bracelet.
Hey, I've been saving to buy this for 20 years.
This is a fine example of what hard work can bring you.
- A gold brick?
- Yes.
You didn't buy that from gypsies, did you?
I probably would've squandered my savings on securities and Internet start-ups.
Well, you will lose that mocking tone soon enough when you try to buy a loaf of bread with paper money after the world economy collapses or we're invaded by aliens.
Aliens?
Now you get an idea of the calibre of conversation in the teachers' lounge.
- Any luck at the Other Realm pound?
- Define "luck".
Lavender, frosting, toast, ginger.
You let him get a dogman?
What's that?
His name's Sparky.
Still warm.
I'm afraid we've got a full-blown case of get-itis.
I don't care if it's on back order.
Oh, morning.
Well, there just aren't enough hours in the day, are there?
Sabrina, you've got a problem.
You're keeping me from getting more stuff.
Mrs. Quick called.
You were supposed to be at the rummage sale.
I completely forgot.
I'm supposed to bring stuff to donate.
Wherever will you find something?
Oh, not my stuff.
I love my stuff.
You are on the verge of becoming spoiled rotten.
All right, quit lobbing the guilt-bombs.
I'll donate some of my stuff to the Hondurans.
Good girl.
You'll feel a lot better when you do.
Do you remember how we got through?
Um Oh, left at the frozen steaks.
Well, I guess I don't need this sled.
Oh, what if it snows next week?
Oh.
I can always donate these ballet slippers, although I have been intrigued by the world of dance.
You know, I don't see my aunts giving away any of their stuff.
They said they wanted someone to clean out this old junk.
Spoiled?
Ha!
I'm selfless.
Sabrina, I was getting worried, but look at all this wonderful stuff you brought.
An Olympic gold medal?
Are you sure you wanna donate this?
Oh, that old thing?
Sure, I can always get more.
Maybe some medals would cheer me up.
And the gold medal in synchronised swimming goes to Mrs. Quick.
What's everybody standing around for?
We've gotta raise more money than any other store.
We're gonna be number one.
Hey, hey, this isn't a reading room.
Buy it or get out.
Sit.
Come on, Sparky, sit.
I know this.
No.
Okay, shake hands.
I got this one.
No, close.
How about beg?
Oh, oh!
Okay, so using you as my driver is not gonna work.
That's it?
Two muffins and a scone?
Come on, crack open the change purse, little missy.
This is for charity.
You know, sometimes I don't have enough faith in Sabrina.
She turned right around and gave away her new things.
She's giving up her Saturday to work on a charity drive.
That girl has a heart of gold.
Well, it does run in the family.
That napkin's not free.
Sabrina, could I get a little help over here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
Oh, cool watch.
I have one like that in my collection of pristine watches that are still in their original packaging, but I forgot to buy one to wear.
Ha.
I think the cream is spoiled.
Does this smell funny to you?
No, I think it's her.
This box would be perfect to store my gold brick.
I'll give you 25 cents for it.
- But it's marked $10.
- I'm haggling.
I get it.
Nine dollars.
Twenty-five cents and I don't write you a detention slip.
Sold, to the man with the vicious scowl.
- Hey, cool lion.
- Hey, thanks.
Hey, listen, I was just talking to Sabrina.
Yeah, didn't she bring some great stuff?
I just bought this hat.
Look, I know you think I don't like her, so don't take this the wrong way, but she reeks.
Okay, Sparky, now that you're calmed down and you have your leash on, I'm gonna take you for a walk.
Walk!
What do you mean I reek?
So much for being able to tell each other anything.
Sure, I've noticed a putrid, rotted, spoiled smell, but it could only be coming from me if I was spoiled rotten.
Excuse me.
Hickory, Dickory, Clock.
We've always got time for you.
Hi, it's just me checking in.
So that was a close call on that get-itis thing, huh?
Well, you did have us worried, but you turned it around.
For the sake of conversation, let's say I hadn't?
You'd become spoiled rotten.
- Literally?
- Of course.
- Aunt Hilda.
- She's not here.
Hello?
Are you here to buy something?
I thought that your customers might get hungry while they're junk shopping.
Don't play innocent with me.
You're trying to help the Hondurans more than we are.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Free brownies with every purchase.
No, no, no.
Oh, oh.
Brownies, yummy.
Sabrina?
Oh, Aunt Hilda.
Oh, what is that disgusting smell?
Not me.
I think we have a little sewage problem.
Oh, I had a pair like those.
Oh, who doesn't have rhinestone-encrusted aardvarks?
Me, that's who.
Well, they can't be mine.
- Mine are magical.
- What?
They turn your hair a different colour every ten minutes.
Impulse buy.
I wonder where those are.
They're probably up in the attic with the rest of the magical junk.
Well, I'm gonna go get more brownies.
I have not yet begun to fight.
Okay, don't panic.
So I've sold magical items to half of Westbridge, and I'm Spoiling rotten.
I always thought the end of the world would involve more locusts.
Sabrina, what are you doing?
I just remembered, this stuff was stored very close to our collection of asbestos dust.
Hey.
Thanks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sweetness, I asked youse for 2 percent.
This is skim.
- I think we got a problem here.
- Yeah, you.
Are you talking to me?
Because if you are, bring those lips closer.
Food?
- But I just fed you.
- Food?
Oh, I can't take those sad puppyman eyes.
Take it.
You're an animal.
Salem?
Emergency.
My room, now.
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.
Salem, make that crisis.
My room, now.
I'm usually opposed to calling in the feds, but don't you think we might wanna alert the aunties?
Admit that I gave away their stuff without permission?
Do you know nothing about teen rebellion?
I know what it smells like.
Oh, here it is.
"Get-itis.
Sub-paragraph 12, Spoiled Rotten".
Blah, blah, blah, horrible person.
Blah, blah, blah, slimy ooze.
Oh.
"To reverse the spoiling process, that which was lost must be regained".
What does that mean?
That the Democrats need to win back the Congress?
Wait, I get it.
I have to get back all the stuff I gave away from the attic.
Only someone spoiled would give away stuff that didn't belong to them.
You were giving away stuff?
Let's see, Mrs. Quick bought that medal.
That must be why she's acting so strange.
By all means, blame the medal.
Uh, Brad bought some stupid bronze lion.
Pfft!
How bad could that be?
Nice kitty.
Uh, Harvey had some hat, and Mr. Kraft bought some sort of little box.
Not Zelda's replicating box?
Maybe, but I'm sure he hasn't figured out how to use it yet.
Wow, you know, this box could probably replicate anything, like food or medicine.
No.
I just gotta round up half a dozen magical objects before I liquefy, easy.
- There's just one more problem.
- What's that?
I hawk up things that smell better than you.
Any better?
Finally.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to walk with six pairs of Odor-Eaters in your shoes?
Are we going out?
Are we going out?
No, we're not going out.
I'm going out.
Bad dogman.
I thought it would be a fun way to keep track of how everyone is doing.
Namely, how badly my rummage sale is trouncing your flour-covered butts.
If you think that glorified garage sale is gonna be-- Ladies, ladies, please.
Let's not forget what's important.
Helping the Hondurans.
- Yeah, sure.
- Whatever.
- Hilda.
- Stop, I know what you're gonna say.
"You're being mean-spirited and aggressive".
Normally, I would let you go on, but you see that medal around Mrs. Quick's neck?
I think that's my old Competitive Spirit medal.
The one Mother used to make me wear when I played field hockey because she said I had no killer instinct?
Man, you were such a priss.
That's why she's being so competitive.
What's your excuse?
Mrs. Quick, what a lovely medal.
- May I see it for a moment?
- Oh, okay.
This really is a charming bake sale.
What do you call these, "also-rans"?
We're number one!
We're number one!
Then again, she may be a competitive nut all on her own.
- Here.
- What on earth are you wearing?
And would you care to explain this?
Glamour don't, and no.
Gotta go.
What?
All's I said was, "Walk that by me one more time".
Harvey.
Hey, looking good.
How's about youse plant a wet one on your old man?
Ah, give me that hat.
Sabrina, you have car deodorisers in your ears.
Well, they'd look ridiculous on my shoes.
Have you seen Brad or Mr. Kraft?
Mr. Kraft said he was gonna Y2K-proof his computer before the millennium bug rains anarchy down on our pitiful world.
I don't know what happened to Brad.
Well, I'm sure he's fine.
That's was my last Skittle.
You're not still hungry, are you?
Please be here.
Mr. Kraft?
Mr. Kraft?
- What do you want?
- There's a problem with the box-- There is no problem.
It's absolutely perfect.
Thank you.
I really don't have time for this.
Miss Spellman, get out.
These bricks are mine.
All mine.
You can't have any of them, not even one.
I don't want any of your bricks.
I just want my box back.
What kind of idiot do you think I am?
Talk about your essay questions.
What's happening to your legs?
Look at you.
Oh, no.
Well, look at you.
You're a paranoid mess.
A rich paranoid mess.
Oh, you're so consumed with making your bricks, I bet you forgot which one was special.
- Which one you worked so hard for.
- Sure, I know, it was this one.
No, it was-- No, it-- How many is it gonna take to make you happy?
Huh?
One thousand, 2,000 bricks?
A dozen watches, hundreds of sweaters?
I have three sweaters, tops.
Look at how pathetic we are.
You with your bricks and me with all my stuff.
And we forgot about the people of Honduras.
I never met them.
And I have been such a spoiled brat.
I mean, it wasn't things in the attic I lost, it was my appreciation for what's really important: People.
Hey, I stopped rotting.
What happened?
Wait a minute, who--?
Who are you?
I know.
You're one of those aliens, aren't you?
Okay.
You're too smart for us, Willard.
We couldn't fool you by pretending to be one of your students.
Well, I am a little sharper than your average Earthling.
Silence.
Give me our box.
Of course, sorry.
Take it.
And donate all your bricks to the charity drive.
- All of them?
- Don't make me fire up the probe.
No.
Sabrina, where did you get all of this?
Oh, it's just junk I had lying around.
Figured I didn't need it anymore.
Ooh, a new DVD player.
I'll give you 50 bucks.
Yes!
We're going to win this time for sure.
We will drink deep from the cup of our enemies' annihilation.
How could I lose?
And so I am happy to give this gold to the needy.
Charity should span all borders, be they earthly or beyond.
I still think Zelda and I could have pulled it off, if something or someone hadn't eaten all our cookies.
Mrs. Quick, I know how hard you worked on the drive.
- That's why I wanna give you this.
- Your charm bracelet?
Oh, Sabrina, I couldn't.
You've already given so much and it means so much to you.
That's why I want you to have it.
I know it'll make you happy.
That means so much more to me.
Oh, thank you, Sabrina.
I hope I don't have to declare this on my taxes.
You know, Sabrina, in a strange way, we're actually very proud of you.
For being an obnoxious spoiled brat, giving away family treasures, almost rotting into a slimy glob, and convincing your boyfriend that he was accosted by aliens?
I said, in a strange way.
Hey, have you seen Brad?
I've been calling him for hours.
Uh, Brad.
- I'd like to return this.
- Hi, Brad.
You know what?
You're our 26th customer today, so you get a free T-shirt and some topical ointment.
But I don't wanna get rid of him.
I love him.
We all do, but he's too much responsibility for you.
Sparky's gonna love being with his new family.
I hear they have a huge farm in the Other Realm and--   Someone's here, someone's here, someone's here.
We're the Midbys.
We're here for Sparky.
Yeah, we're here for Sparky.
- I'm gonna miss you, boy.
Son, he's your responsibility.
I'll take care of him.
You think I could have a llama?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
How do you like my new litter box?
Halloween.
Is it just a date on the calendar that people from England don't know about?
Or is it a state of mind?
Or is it a state of being?
I frankly don't know.
But come along on our Halloween journey and maybe by the end, we'll all know.
Is this lining real satin?
Sabrina, could you help me pick up some stuff this afternoon?
"Water balloons, toilet paper, dry ice, rotten eggs"?
One more thing, could you find out where the biology lab gets those pigs in formaldehyde?
Your mom on another one of her crazy diets?
Hey, we only have 33 hours and 12 minutes left till Halloween night.
We gotta start planning our pranks and tricks now.
I can't.
Dreama and I are gonna go look for after-school jobs.
We figured the best time to do it would be after school.
But this could be our last hurrah.
My dad says that the Westbridge City Council is gonna make it illegal for kids over the age of 17 to trick-or-treat.
That's just wrong.
I was gonna march against sweatshop labour in the Orient, but now I've got this.
I can't believe how few glamorous, high-paying, after-school jobs there are for inexperienced teenagers.
Life is so unfair.
So have you decided if you're an existentialist, an idealist or a nihilist?
Actually, currently, I'm an unemployed-ist.
Thought you were in my philosophy class.
Sorry.
Can you believe it?
A real, live college student was talking to you.
College is gonna be so great.
We'll get to take classes like philosophy and hang out in places like this with guys who take philosophy.
- Why don't you get a job here.
- That'd be great.
This place is so cool and none of the furniture matches.
- Do you know how to make coffee?
- No.
But if my cat can do it when he's half-asleep, how hard can it be?
Oh, excuse me, I'd like to speak to the manager.
- You from the Health Department?
- No.
Then I'm the manager.
I'm also the cashier, the table busser and the bouncer.
Matter of fact, do you know what they call me?
- What?
- Josh.
Oh, well, excuse me, Mr. Josh.
I'm looking for a job.
You are, huh?
You got any experience?
Experience?
I travel with my own Melitta filters.
So you got no idea how to make coffee?
- None.
- Could I get a little service?
Oh, I'm sorr-- Oh!
Nice save.
If you can pour as well as you catch, you're hired.
Fantastic.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This is gonna make it hard to negotiate salary, isn't it?
So was the roller coaster scary?
Scary?
They make you sign an organ-donor form before letting you on.
We rode upside down, holding boiling soups and lawn darts.
And still, not scary.
Here it is, the Halloween season and we can't find one thing to scare us.
Perhaps we should give that dentist who works without Novocaine another try.
In just a few hours, people will be mistaking me for Juan Valdez.
All right, let me know what you think and be brutal.
- Come on, it can't be that bad.
- You try it.
It's fine.
Just a little chewy.
It's been decades since I've enjoyed the sweet taste of terror.
Your wait has come to an end, my fright-craving friend.
Suppose the three of us go to a graveyard, and I'll read some of the ghost stories I've written.
The Tales of Salem.
See, the mere prospect paralyses you with fear.
No, but your sad little suggestion gave me an idea.
You know who writes stories that are truly scary?
- Edgar Allan Poe.
- You're right.
Hey, let's make use of our time-travel clock and invite him for a Halloween dinner.
Don't tell me you're scared by Sissy Pants Poe?
Are you implying that the author of "The Tell-Tale Heart" isn't scary?
His stories are scary because I gave him all his best ideas.
If it weren't for old Salem, you'd be shivering to "The Tell-Tale Kidney".
Okay, here's the correct way to bus a table.
First, the trash.
Try to avoid screaming, "Yuck," at the top of your lungs.
I once saw my vice principal in his boxer shorts, not a peep.
Next, the mugs.
All right, I like to pretend the half-full ones mean good luck.
And then you reach the mother lode.
A whole quarter tip.
You think you can handle that table?
Yeah, just hand me a germ-laden rag and I'm on it.
Oh, by the way, I know it's last-minute, but is there any chance you can work the night shift on Halloween?
While everyone else is goofing off, I get to make coffee and wash dirty cups?
- And clean the spill tray.
- All this and minimum wage?
Where go I get my shots?
Great news, Hildie.
Edgar Allan Poe R.S.V.P.
'd.
We're on our way to being truly scared.
- Ooh.
He even wrote it in blood.
- Actually, I think that's red crayon.
Good, there's scary and there's gross.
Hi, Sabrina, how's our favourite coffee maker?
The correct term is barista.
I love my job.
College kids are so sophisticated.
They talk about art and literature and foreign films.
By the way, who's Jack Kerouac, what's cubism and can I get a futon?
While you're here, give us a hand.
Edgar Allan Poe is coming for dinner.
We want the house to be really scary so he'll be comfortable.
I thought the sound of clanking chains might be nice.
I was thinking more along the lines of thunder and lightning.
- So much for the tool shed.
- Let's get decorating.
It's my turn to hang up the skeleton.
You're dreaming.
You always get to hang up the skeleton.
- Well, then, it's tradition.
Give me.
- Don't make me separate you two.
What is it about this holiday that makes people act immature?
- Well, she started it.
- The pranks and hokey horror stuff.
You know, lucky for me, I've got plans for Halloween.
I'm gonna be working at the coffeehouse.
Sabrina, you're a witch.
Witches can't run away from Halloween.
Watch me.
I'm done will all this kid stuff.
Okay, that was ominous.
- Yeah, and it didn't scare me a bit.
- Me either.
You know, I've been thinking of revising my will and leaving you my entire collection of Pez dispensers.
- What do you want?
- A ride to the graveyard tonight?
- Please?
- No can do.
I've gotta work.
Oh, that's right.
You've got that nice boss.
Real generous guy.
- Thinking of others, giving of himself.
- Your point?
Think he'd give me a ride to the graveyard?
You know, I'm really surprised our special pumpkin-flavoured coffee hasn't been more popular.
Think it has to do with the fact that it's a hideous shade of orange and tastes like pumpkin?
Trick or treat.
- None of the above.
- Great costumes, huh?
You wouldn't believe how hard it was to find ones that fit.
- It's flame-retardant.
- Aren't you old for this?
Not until the city council passes that law.
Tonight is gonna be a Halloween for the record books.
We're gonna warm up by egging Coach Cook's house, work in a cow tip or two, and time permitting, wrap things up by streaking across old Lady Blankenship's front yard.
I'm glad to see you've added subtlety to your bag of tricks this year.
Harv, why are we standing here?
We should be out there burning poop.
I know how you love Tootsie Pops, so I'll save any I get for you.
Wash your hands first.
Cute kids.
I guess that's what happens when pregnant women smoke.
Well, I've gotta get to the library and finish my essay on Shakespeare's comedies.
I've compared, now I'm ready to contrast.
Wait, you're gonna leave me here to run things by myself?
That's why I asked you to work tonight.
I really need someone I can trust.
The last guy I left here rented it out to bikers.
How can you can trust me?
I've only worked here one day and I have very shifty eyes.
I'll only be a couple of hours.
I'll be back in time to help you close up.
But what if someone comes in and wants to order something?
You give it to them?
I promise you Halloween night here is so easy.
The place is a morgue.
Josh was right.
I can handle this.
And he's depending on me.
- And that's not scary.
You're a witch, Sabrina.
You can't run away from Halloween.
And that's just the onset of senility.
- May I help you?
- I wanna chop you up in little pieces.
- You want what?
- I want a cup of coffee.
Okay, I'm just letting my imagination get the best of me.
But if I turn around and he's got an axe, he loses the benefit of the doubt.
Okay, well would you like to join our Biscotti of the Month Club?
I don't think I'll be back.
This coffee's so strong, it could wake the dead.
"Wake the dead".
What was that guy talking about?
I mean, this batch was almost liquid.
See?
Everything is fine.
So far I've served five or six people and not a single attempt on my life.
Aah!
Okay, calm down.
It's just the muffin tray.
Muffins are not scary.
They're fat-free.
I'm gonna die!
Hi, Dreama.
- Hilda, I'd like you to meet Mr. Poe.
- It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Thanks for the ride.
That voice, it's so scary.
May I take your cape?
- No garment could be scarier.
- This is the stuff of nightmares.
The only thing scary about that cape is that he died in it and never had it cleaned.
Well, if no one wants to listen to my horror stories, I'll just go shred some beloved sweaters.
Apparently an AA meeting just let out.
Mind giving me a hand here?
I've never really made a cappuccino before.
Well, that's where good old-fashioned American ingenuity comes in handy.
Okay, and a little magic.
Frothy milk, nice and hot-tay Whip me up two low-fat lattes  Okay.
There you go.
There you are.
Listen, Zelda forgot to pick up the one thing that will make Edgar Allan Poe feel at home.
An open bar?
- A black cat.
- Forget it.
Fine, then I'll go with my second choice.
Quoth the raven, "Bite me".
- Finally, we get a moment to relax.
- I know.
You know, I have to admit, before you got here, I was feeling sort of  Afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a severe thunderstorm.
On a calm, cloud-free evening.
This has nothing to do with my aunts trying to warn me that I couldn't avoid Halloween?
- Stop that.
- I thought that was my stomach.
What kind of people go out for coffee in weather like this?
The flesh-eating zombie kind.
Mmm.
Oh.
Ladies, that was the best meal I've had in years.
In the afterlife, they don't cook with salt.
Can you believe how much roast beef he ate?
Talk about "The Pig and the Pendulum".
And four desserts.
That'll teach you to serve rum cake.
Still, we're lucky to have the scariest writer of all time as our Halloween guest.
Mr. Poe, would this be a good time for you to read us a story?
Absolutely.
If you don't mind, I'd like to read something new.
I'm just practising.
I don't think that lock was built to withstand an onslaught from the undead.
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Wait a minute, we're witches.
I don't feel like visiting With corpses today Please make those zombies Go away Uh-oh.
We have to get rid of them the old-fashioned way.
- What's that?
- Help, help, help!
Would you mind turning down your thunder?
If you turn down your clanking chains.
Very well.
A poem by Edgar Allan Po--  What is that ringing?
A telephone.
That's how we communicate these days.
Haven't you people ever heard of e-mail?
Salem, get the phone.
Go ahead, curdle our blood.
"Salem, we're too busy being scared out of our wits to answer the phone".
Hello?
Salem, exactly what did my aunts mean when they said that I couldn't avoid Halloween?
- I'm fine, how are you?
- Salem.
If you run away from Halloween, Halloween will find you.
And it won't be happy.
Ugh!
And once Halloween has found you, how do you get it to un-find you?
That'll require research.
Do it, and hurry.
Right, like I got nothing better to do than save your anti-Halloween butt.
Of all the ways to go, death by zombie?
I can't bear to look.
What are they doing?
Are they clawing at our flesh?
Actually, they're having a party.
I am so fired.
Josh is gonna be back any second and I'm pretty sure zombies are messier than bikers.
Excuse me.
Ugh!
Sorry.
Eck!
Just because their bodies are rotting doesn't mean they can't shower once in awhile.
- Hello?
Here's the deal.
To get out of your predicament, you have to experience the fun of Halloween.
Fun?
I'm up to my arms in arms.
If I may suggest some fun, think of a trip to the graveyard to listen to Salem's horror stories.
Hello?
What fresh hell is this?
You don't understand.
My boss trusted me to keep an eye on this place and if he comes back and it's not-- Ow!
This happens when you try to reason with someone who's decaying.
Toilet paper.
Oh, great, just what I need.
More Halloween fun.
- Wait, that is what I need.
Brad, give me another roll.
It's Harvey and Brad.
Harvey, quit tp'ing the Christian Science Reading Room and get over here.
Interesting clientele.
What's that smell?
This is our last year we can trick-or-treat.
So let's make it count.
Gee, Sabrina, we thought you were too mature for Halloween.
- Stop talking and start tp'ing.
Okay.
- They're leaving.
- Woo-hoo!
We broke the spell.
Oh, wait, who forgot their foot?
What did I tell you about Sabrina's pranks?
Her family takes Halloween very seriously.
And you keep telling me they're not weird.
Harvey, you were right.
Why not just loosen up and enjoy Halloween?
As long as little kids aren't making fun of us to our faces.
You're the best.
"I love you enough to let you walk.
But I love you too much to let you run.
But you don't want to walk.
You want to run.
Let's skip.
- Part 17".
- Excuse me, Mr. Poe?
I don't mean to interrupt, but we thought that you were going to read us something less dull.
She means something scary.
Horror?
I haven't done that tripe in years.
There's a much bigger market in inspirational writing.
Is that what this is?
Hilda, he's our guest.
We have to be polite.
"Rainbows and sparkles, kittens in a box".
He's going down.
See you guys later.
And don't let all the crickets loose in Mr. Kraft's house till I get there.
Okay, a quick clean-up and I'm home free.
So I don't get fired And take a lot of flack - Help me clean up before my boss--  Sabrina?
Oh.
Josh, hi.
What happened to this place?
Look at all this toilet paper.
You wouldn't believe how many kids came dressed as Mr. Whipple this year.
I'm sorry.
I know it's easy to get behind on your bussing - when you're the only one here, but - Am I fired?
I mean, I know I have to clean up and all, but after that, am I fired?
Well, it is Halloween.
People should have fun.
And we are insured.
Hey, what's that?
I don't see any--  Wow, I guess this was worth 14.95.
Are you okay?
As soon as my heart starts beating again, I'll be swell.
Well, I heard you like them, so I brought you a Tootsie Pop.
Thanks.
So really, I'm not fired?
"Though she screamed as loud as she could, not a sound could be heard, for the water slowly but inexorably rose over her face".
Poor Salem, he was so determined to read his stores whether anyone listened or not.
"Until at last, she was no more".
The end.
See, I told you they were scary.
My first mortal Halloween.
I had such a great time.
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Your boss, Josh, he's great.
There's one thing that bothers me about him.
- What?
- I have a huge crush on him.
So, what is it we learned in this week's episode?
That, try as you may, you cannot run away from Halloween.
That you never really know what lurks beneath your neighbourhood sewer grate.
And that those zombies were really scary.
Oh, right, my coffee.
Hey, where's my biscotti?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Ai-yaah!
Let me guess.
They're doing A Chorus Line and you're Cassie?
I, Salem, have taken up Tae Bo.
Instead of conquering the world, I'm just gonna kick butt.
You can't learn Tae Bo.
You have no body weight or leg extension.
Not to mention will or courage.
Perfect.
I will use that as my daily affirmation.
I think you're gonna need some help.
Billy Blanks.
I am your clay.
Mould me.
Now that doesn't look so hard.
Salem, are you okay?
I love this sport.
Hey, do you still have that crush on Josh?
Oh, please.
When's the last time I brought that up?
- Yesterday.
- Are you wearing a wire for the feds?
Okay, so I had a teensy crush on him, but I'm over it.
Harvey's the only guy for me.
- Plus Josh isn't even that nice.
Hi, guys.
Sabrina, here's your cappuccino the way you like it.
And don't worry about the dishes, I already did them.
See?
What a creep.
You know, we have been so busy at the clock shop that we are really behind on our chores.
Oh, style maven B. Smith would be horrified.
I can top that.
I'm horrified.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, take a look at this.
Okay.
Turn the bowl into an apple.
Okay, the bowl was a priceless heirloom.
But nice magic, Dreama.
Wait.
Give it a minute.
This keeps happening.
It's because she's nervous.
Remember when I got nervous, all I could zap in were pineapples?
But never the ham.
I think Dreama's suffering from a lack of magic glue.
That's why her spells don't stick.
Hold the pull an extra beat.
Oh, okay.
Let's hurry.
Harvey's football game starts in 15 minutes.
And the sooner I get there, the sooner I can be numb from the cold.
Oh, you know, she's really not that much of help.
Hey, did you see me waving at you?
In this temperature, it's hard to get lateral movement.
But I got a good up and down motions going.
I'm sorry.
I get so into the game that I don't notice anything around me.
Imagine if I were actually playing.
You wanna go get some coffee and warm up?
I told Brad and the others I'd meet them at the Slicery.
But since you sat through this whole game for me, I'll do something I don't wanna do for you.
Let's go get coffee.
You romantic, you.
Hey, that folk singer I'm always talking about is playing here tonight.
- Bob Dylan?
- Let me rephrase that.
That folk singer no one's ever heard of is playing here tonight.
Oh, well, maybe he'll play that song no one's ever heard of.
Why do people keep coming in here?
Oh, yeah, the "open" sign.
And the writing On the tuna can said Packed in water This dolphin's dead And to think I almost missed this by playing foosball with my friends.
Go to the Slicery if you're not having fun.
We don't have to be together on every date.
Thanks.
Man, we have a great relationship.
I really hope he doesn't sell out and go electric.
Hey, if that's a grocery list, I need my blue power drink.
Sorry, obviously we're behind in our chores.
Just have some juice.
But my punches and kicks are powerless without that expensive blue liquid.
Look what I found in the laundry.
That's been there since Lyndon Johnson was president?
Andrew Johnson.
We are behind.
You could just zap me some of that synthetically engineered beverage.
You know what happens to witches who zap chores in the mortal realm.
They live happily ever after?
They end up taking everything for granted and appreciating nothing.
Don't worry, we're gonna buckle down, and handle this the way any mortal would.
We're hiring someone to do our housework.
In fact, I am going to send the application right now.
After we remove two years of Hot Pocket crumbs from the toaster.
Hold on.
That sounds dangerous.
Better let an expert handle it.
Worth it.
Oh.
Oliver Twist.
They don't write them like that anymore.
You know Oliver Twist?
That's great.
My study group just fell apart.
I have this big exam.
- You think you can ask me questions?
- Sure.
Be right back.
Oh, stupid pineapple.
Don't be nervous.
Make me read fast and good As if my name were Evelyn Wood Okay.
All right.
Name the boys who were part - of Fagin's band of ragamuffins.
- Oh.
That's easy-- Which one was the most Christ-like figure and why?
So much for lobbing me a softball to get started.
Um We might be here all night.
Maybe we should send out for some coffee.
Heh-heh.
I can't wait for our new housekeeper to get here.
I know.
I'm exhausted watching you clean so much.
I want a word with that agency.
Let's start with the key facts: - One, we don't want you here.
- No.
And two, the last time you were here, you tried to kill us.
- But failed.
We're on probation.
We need this job to stay out of prison.
Well, they don't smell of drink.
- Any weapons?
- Only ones that kills germs on contact.
We did accidentally keep them locked up without any food or water for several decades.
True.
Okay, boys, you guilted us into it.
All right.
- But If I'm pierced by just one cutlass, you're out of here.
Well, it's Thursday.
Ready to go wander around the mall like we always do?
I can't.
Some of the guys are gonna kidnap Eastbridge's mascot.
They need me along.
Why?
How many people does it take to steal a turtle?
A heavily guarded turtle.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, totally.
That's just the kind of relationship Harvey and I have.
He does what he wants to do, I do what I wanna do.
So mature that we don't even care that we're not seeing each other.
I hope the pirates are having a good day.
Or at least a bloodless one.
Welcome to your home.
Everything looks okay.
The clutter's gone, the rug's vacuumed.
Nice job, boys.
With one tiny exception.
Who are these people?
Scurvy knaves what come to pillage.
Anyone who rang the doorbell.
Hi, I'm Ed McMahon.
Could somebody untie me?
Oh, of course, Mr. McMahon.
Already a winner.
Ha-ha.
Yeah, right.
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you for coming.
Don't forget to write.
- Watch your step.
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Heh-heh.
Good first day, eh?
How should I put this?
Nay.
Um Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
For not pointing out that you shrunk?
Thanks to your exquisite quizzing, I aced the Oliver Twist exam.
Well, it was fresh on my mind.
Have you read Great Expectations?
Okay.
I mean, sure.
Yeah, I could give you some exquisite quizzing on that.
Thank you.
Ladies, ladies, please, don't fire us.
They'll chain us in a dungeon for a hundred years.
- Look, my allergies will go crazy.
- Oh.
Perhaps you don't understand.
- You did a very poor job.
- Oh.
What were we thinking?
They're wild maniacs.
No one can train them to keep house.
We need someone with an iron fist.
We need Norman Schwartzkopf.
We need George Patton.
We need Excuse me.
B. Smith.
We can't talk and make centrepieces at the same time.
Later, I'll show you how to rejuvenate the edges on your daggers.
- Hey, Sabrina, I-- - Nice banana.
I can turn it into a watch for about ten seconds.
Oh, so your magic glue still isn't sticking?
Well, on the plus side, no pineapples.
Oh, I checked my schedule.
I'm not working Friday.
Think you could help me study then?
You'll have to ask my boss if he can give me the night off.
- I'll have a word with him.
- Okay.
But be careful because he gets kind of violent when he's been drinking.
You can't study with him Friday night.
Aren't you going to Harvey's game?
I forgot.
Harvey won't care, I mean, he hardly even notices when I'm there.
He won't mind if I miss just one.
Sabrina.
Say hello to Harry.
We fixed him up with a heat rock in my garage, and you should see this guy eat peas.
You know you have to give him back after the game.
I know.
Here, look what I got you.
Oh.
It'll go perfect with my "beat Eastbridge" skirt.
This is gonna be the best game ever.
Come on, Harry, time for your walk.
Okay, so maybe this game does mean something to Harvey.
I'll just talk with Josh.
Wow.
Sabrina, I just checked my syllabus.
This test counts for half my grade.
You're my lifesaver.
I'll see you Friday.
Do things ever work out well for you?
Heh.
Whoa-yuk!
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, help.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Perhaps I can guide you through the philosophy of Tae Bo.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Harvey's expecting me at his game, I told Josh I'd help him study.
I see.
And in this scenario, who do you need to kickbox?
Forget it.
What am I gonna do?
My whole world is crashing down around me, I can't think of anything--  Do I smell fudge?
So I don't wanna disappoint Josh, but I don't wanna disappoint Harvey, either.
- What do you want to do?
- Oh, yes, very good, yes.
Well, I've been to every game Westbridge has ever had, but I've never been inside a college library.
Then help Josh.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's right.
- But which boy needs you more?
- Oh.
- Well, Josh could study without me.
- Harvey.
- Harvey, it is.
But Harvey definitely could play without me.
- Josh.
- Josh.
But if I go to the game, Josh would just be inconvenienced.
Harvey might be hurt.
Ah - Harvey.
- Harvey.
- Josh.
- No.
Okay.
It's decided.
I'll tell Josh tomorrow I can't study.
- Mm.
Look, as long as we're sharing, - Oh.
I was wondering if everyone could help me with a personal problem I've been struggling with.
- Sure.
What is it?
- I've got full-blown scurvy.
I'm really sorry, Josh, but-- No, too high school.
No, too French.
Hey, Sabrina.
I've reserved a special carrel at the library tonight.
I promise there will be all the water-cooler water you can drink.
And I plan to bring gum.
- Heh.
Listen, Josh-- - No, okay, okay, serious time here.
I'm here on a scholarship, and if I don't keep my grades up, it's gone.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is, are you sure you don't mind?
Please, like I have anywhere else to be.
Sabrina, guess what.
Strep throat is running wild through the football team.
- Oh, boy.
- So many of the guys are sick, there's a very real possibility that I might get to play.
Tonight?
- Listen, Harvey-- - How lucky is that?
I might actually get into a game before I graduate, and my best girl will get to see it.
Yeah, how lucky is that?
I gotta go see how many of the cultures came back positive.
Help.
Okay.
So we have a plan.
If Harvey gets in the game, you'll witch page me, I'll zap back.
- Any questions?
- Yes.
- What's a witch pager?
- This.
You have to think, "Sabrina," pull on your ear, and it will let me know you want me, try it.
Good.
Don't use it frivolously, because I'm ticklish.
And it's on vibrate.
- Any other questions?
- Yes.
What's football?
I can't believe the library's closed for painting.
I'm sorry, certain places should always be open, like hospitals and Denny's.
Well, we can always study in here.
It's warm and it's warm.
Oh.
It smells wonderful in here.
Yes, like steak or prime rib or-- We aren't missing a mailman, are we?
We've been slaving over a hot oven all day.
We assumed you'd want your meat cooked.
- You assumed correctly.
- Told you.
Lucky guess.
Oh, my.
For tonight's dinner, we will start off with a hardtack salad with barrel-ale dressing followed by braised seagull with the head.
- After that--  I'm sorry.
I don't know the politically correct words to say this.
But do you have anything that's a little less pirate-y?
For dessert, we have a lovely crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
That sounds wonderful.
Is it homemade?
I don't know.
I'll go untie your neighbour and ask.
Remember, baby steps.
Excuse me.
If a person's sitting on the bench there, he's not in the game, right?
Excuse me.
- I'd say we're done here.
- Oh, yes.
Now is there anything else I should know about Great Expectations?
Only that I have them, and I'm consequently disappointed.
Oh, hey, look who's here.
Come on in, come on.
Heh.
Hey.
Everyone, this is Sabrina.
Sabrina, this is everyone.
Good.
I've always wanted to meet everyone.
- So where are you guys headed?
- To the apartment for Chinese food.
But we could stop and share.
- I know it's late, but would you like--?
- Food.
We'll have a good time.
I'm sorry.
I thought we did something good.
This is so fun.
At home, we have to eat Chinese food off of dishes.
If you like this, you'd love my dorm mac and cheese.
I pour water into the box, shake and eat.
Or plateless tuna salad.
Bite of tuna, lick of mayonnaise, bite of bread.
Or grilled cheese made with an iron.
Or pancakes grilled on a heating pad.
Heh.
No, I've never tried it either.
I was wondering if you had.
All right.
He's in.
We have to wait to find out if he'll ever come out of the coma.
Excuse me.
Go, Harvey.
Sabrina, she was talking about a soap opera.
Sabrina?
Good, you're here.
Harvey just stood up.
And any minute he'll be-- Done with his water?
Sorry.
I'll be more careful.
That's okay.
At least no one had time to miss me.
Sabrina?
- Lose something?
- No, but I found something.
- A pineapple?
- A perfectly good pineapple.
You know, people throw away the darnedest things.
Stupid nerves.
Mm.
That was delicious.
I don't know how to thank you.
You can start by taking your elbows off the table.
- Quite rude.
- I'll drink to that.
No.
That's your finger bowl.
I could have told you that.
And could you please not speak with your mouth full?
Oh.
This will wash it down.
Baby steps.
Getting up.
Walking.
He's on the field.
When did Dickens die?
In 1870 of a stroke.
I think Dickens would have us laugh in the face of death.
Anyone with me?
Bathroom.
All right, this is it.
He's on the field.
He's chasing his gum wrapper.
He got it.
Bye.
Whew.
I would have been out sooner, but this was clogging up the sink.
Another pineapple?
Yeah, maybe they're on sale someplace.
On sale, that's a good one.
I'll be right back.
Anyone need anything from the bathroom?
I like her.
I'm sorry.
I thought for sure-- That's it.
I'm turning this thing off.
There's only two minutes left.
Harvey won't be playing.
If I leave for the bathroom one more time, I go from being quirky to sad.
ANNOUNCER : And halfback Jonathan Shapiro is out of the game.
Taking his place will be Harvey Kinkle.
Yay!
Boo!
Sabrina?
No fruit?
I was in the bathroom.
Why would I have fruit?
You've obviously had too much moo goo.
Come on, I'm walking you home.
There's a long pass, and Kinkle catches it.
Kinkle's streaking for the end zone.
And Harvey Kinkle saves the day.
Oh, he has turned this from a humiliating loss into a slightly less humiliating loss.
- I gotta get to my girl.
Please let this work.
Hey, Harvey.
Uh-oh.
No glue.
Where did Sabrina go?
She had to go home.
She's sick, yeah.
- It must have come up fast.
- Yes.
I'd better go see if she's okay.
N-- This coffee is wonderful.
Amen.
Oh, and the decorative doily enhances it so.
Presentation, presentation, presentation.
Gentlemen, we have good news.
You're permanently hired.
So that means no prison.
Yo-ho-ho!
Listen.
- We've talked it over.
We have.
And we've decided that, with all of our skills, we need to work for people who have taste and breeding.
Someone classy.
Yeah.
So thanks, but no, thanks.
- Yeah.
- No, please, don't get up.
Not that you would.
We'll show ourselves out.
Well, I don't think I've ever been fired by an employee before.
I'll never trust a man wearing a bandana again.
But it is good coffee.
A goat?
Yeah.
If everyone would buy a goat, we could eliminate leaf blowers and help stop global warming.
- Thanks for helping me study.
- You're welcome.
And maybe someday, you can admit I'm right about the goat thing.
You don't look sick to me.
Harvey, wait.
I'm sorry.
But we have never seen such a poorly managed household.
Lord knows we've tried.
But I don't think there's any help for you people.
None.
Never have we encountered a family with such a stunning lack of decorum.
Dogs running wild.
Your children quite unruly.
Then I won't even touch the subject of your teeth.
Ah!
We quit.
Gentlemen.
I don't believe I've ever been fired by an employee before.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Paula Abdul really knows how to pick a man.
I love her.
She doesn't know you're alive.
Well, that's gonna change.
I know some people in high places who have some friends who told me her number's on the Internet.
Oh, Lord, she ran into a wall again.
No, she's taking waltzing lessons.
It is a great way to exercise.
I'm just having trouble finding a partner.
Zelda?
I don't plan on being reduced to dancing with my sister until they put us in the home.
I've got to talk to Harvey.
No time for eating.
- How about a waltz?
- How about no?
She kissed Josh last night, and Harvey saw them.
What?
And no one called me at waltz class to tell me?
I want that.
There.
Great.
A fake talking cat.
Just what we need around here.
So Sabrina kissed Josh, and Harvey saw them?
- Tell me everything.
- That's everything.
You go, girl.
Hey.
- Hey.
Enough small talk.
Listen, Harvey, I want to explain to you about that thing that happened with Josh.
By "thing," you mean the kiss, right?
Let's not argue over semantics.
Look, I didn't plan to kiss him.
- But you looked like you enjoyed it.
- Enjoy?
Well, now we're getting into semantics again.
PAULA : Hi, leave a message and I'll get back to you.
If this is that weird guy, Salem, stop weeping into my phone.
All right, when a woman's avoiding you, a man has to be a man and has to do the manly thing: Pretend to be kidnapped.
We figured you'd be home for lunch.
So how did things go with Harvey?
He's not speaking to me.
The Josh kiss was that good, huh?
I don't know what to do.
I like Harvey and I don't wanna lose him, but I like Josh too.
Well, I always say, don't take your foot off the dock until the other one is securely on the ship.
- What?
- What?
Until you're sure Josh is interested, keep one foot on Harvey.
Hilda, that's dishonest.
Really?
It sounds kind of perfect.
You know you shouldn't treat people like that.
Put yourself in Harvey's place.
Watch out.
This spell is never pretty.
Of empathy This girl has very few traces Allow Sabrina and Harvey To trade places Harvey.
Oh, hey, Sabrina.
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.
What?
But I'm your girlfriend.
Were.
Until I figured out whether things were gonna work out with Sarah.
They are.
Okay, upsetting and creepy.
In your heart, you know that honesty is the right way to go.
Fine.
It's a lot more fun talking to Aunt Hilda.
Harvey, I have to be honest with you.
Great.
That's what coach says right before, "Your best effort isn't good enough".
I wanna be your girlfriend, but I have feelings for Josh too, and I don't want to string you along.
Unless that's something you're interested in.
You know, I've been second string in football, basketball, even badminton.
I don't wanna be second string with you.
Harvey.
Hey, I hope you and Josh are happy.
I am so sick of leading.
Oh!
Ugh.
It's never Fred Astaire.
My kidnapping plan is under way.
I haven't called Paula Abdul in 15 whole minutes.
I'm sure she's in a panic about my kidnapping.
I love my life.
Can I be honest?
Honesty stinks.
Has Josh said anything about the kiss?
No.
And I gave him my best "Hi, Josh," all I got back was a "Hey".
- I don't think he likes me.
- He kissed you.
That was hours ago.
Maybe he's moved on.
Oh, why did I tell Harvey that I like Josh?
But I do like Josh.
I can make him like me.
Hey, Josh, can I borrow that when you're finished?
My textbook on 19th-century philosophy?
- Yeah, I can't get enough of it.
- You can't?
I think your cocoa's getting cold.
Knock yourself out.
Thanks.
Ha-ha.
He hates me.
She came in through the clock.
I have no idea what she's saying.
Somebody please tell me what's going on.
Oh, well, I could have done that.
- What is your name?
- Marie Curie.
Madame Curie, the famous scientist?
- This is an honour.
- It certainly is.
How do we get rid of her?
Well, we have to figure out what caused her to become lost in time.
Madame, what year do you think this is?
That was before she won the Nobel Prize with her husband, Pierre.
Pierre?
Ptoo!
We are finished.
He is a worm.
Ptoo!
Obviously, they don't give a prize for manners.
Hey, I'm actually not working Saturday night.
Hey, you're not working, either.
Any plans?
No, not really.
Well, I don't have any plans, either.
Weird.
So you like sci-fi movies, right?
Oh, yeah.
If mankind is in peril and it's in black and white, I'm there.
Well, they're showing my favourite, The Blob.
Steve McQueen and a big tub of goo.
What else do you need in a movie?
Well, it's playing at the student union, and since we're both not working, and we're both sci-fi fanatics, we should go.
- What, you mean, like a date?
- A date?
Well, that never really crossed my mind, but are you asking?
Look, Sabrina, I like you a lot.
And obviously, as evidenced by that little kiss the other night, I find you attractive.
So you'll pick me up at 8?
- But I'm so much older than you.
- Four years.
I'm glad you see my point.
I really think it would be better if we just stayed friends.
He thinks I'm "too young" for him.
Did he use air quotes or did he really mean too young?
I guess I do come off my own age.
I saw Harvey jumpstart his car today.
- Significance?
- We used to do that together.
I was always the negative.
So what you're saying is, you'd really rather be with Harvey.
No, it's not that.
It's just I need to make myself seem more sophisticated.
- For Harvey?
- No, for Josh.
Okay, now my head hurts.
Sabrina, my many years on this Earth have taught me one thing: You can't control love.
Meanwhile, I need you to cut some words out of those magazines for me.
"Kidnapped.
Million dollars".
- What is this for?
- The-- A Pictionary?
Hey, peeps.
I hear Phi Beta-- Max is having a big party tonight.
Who's in?
- Aren't you in high school?
- She's a senior at Westbridge.
Got to go.
So I signed up for this waltz class.
It's great exercise and fun.
I just need a partner.
So, what do you say?
No.
Fine.
Oh, by the way, Tintin, not funny.
Where am I gonna find a dance partner?
My foyer.
Ha-ha.
Look who came through the clock.
Pierre Curie.
Obviously, he's here for Marie.
I'm sure the minute they see each other, everything will be fine.
Marie.
Ptoo!
No wonder our French grandmother covered her sofas in plastic.
I don't suppose you waltz?
Oh, well, it's been years, but Hmm.
You're so good.
- And so French.
- Oh.
Hilda?
Hilda.
Excuse me.
Heh-heh.
Can we focus?
We have got to get the Curies back together.
Now here's the plan.
You find out from Pierre what attracted him to Marie, and I'll find out the same from Marie.
- We'll have to win their confidence.
- Well, good point.
And what better way than by dancing?
Heh-heh.
Okay, the mortal way of looking older is not working.
- So magic is the only answer.
- Let me.
Sabrina's down and hurt Make her as old as dirt  Oh, yeah.
Josh will just sweep me away.
Don't do that again.
Josh is hung up on the fact I'm in high school, - so I just have to be a little older.
- Ooh.
This looks like a good one.
"To enhance your years Try a potion Check out the counter Of notions and lotions" "Oil of Old Age.
Apply to your face and throat, and you'll age gracefully".
How do you feel?
Like I'm ready to backpack across Europe.
All right, that's gotta be early 20s.
So tell me, Pierre, what attracted you to Marie?
Whoo!
Tell me later.
Ha-ha.
Madame-- Marie, what attracted you to Pierre?
He had a laboratory and no debts.
Oh.
So it was a love match.
Whoa!
Hey.
Hello.
Heh.
- May I buy you a cup of coffee?
- Do you think they sell that here?
I'm loving this.
I feel so mature, so confident and just smooth.
This spell is the best.
Why did I make such a big deal about four years?
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm posting that on my website tonight.
Josh at 10 o'clock.
Oh, hi, Josh.
Listen, is it too late for me to change my mind about that movie?
No, we can go see The Blot-- I mean, The Blob.
Good.
First, dinner.
Then, scary monsters.
Yes.
You know, magic does have a certain sense of whimsy, doesn't it?
Latte.
- Sabrina?
- Oh, hello, Harvey.
It's nice to see you again.
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- That's weird.
- All right, class, let's settle down.
Hello, Barbara.
Are you available for lunch?
I'm good next Friday.
Sabrina, I need some help.
I've thought that for years, but now is not the time.
Josh is waiting.
I just need you to take a picture of me with today's newspaper.
- Why?
- Eee-- Lawsuit.
High school has really taken a toll on that girl.
Well, I'll have the burger and fries.
Do you have any fish?
Do you have any fish that isn't breaded and deep fried?
Just water for me.
Saving room for the mile-high mud cake?
No.
Listen, Sabrina, we haven't really talked about the other night, and I know I've been sending mixed signals-- I'm glad you brought it up.
I need to know your intentions.
Intentions?
It's our first date.
The perfect time to find out if this relationship's going anywhere.
Well, I don't know, I mean, we're at different points in our lives.
I'm thinking about graduate school, a career-- And I'm thinking about kids and a career.
Mister, I want it all, but I can't make that happen with Peter Pan.
Now, I need to know, are you in it for the long haul?
Screaming babies, stretch marks, the works?
That's a good question.
And it's gonna require some careful thought.
And I should get started on that thinking right now.
And to think I just threw away the last three minutes with that man.
So I discovered that this blue liquid can replace a centrifuge.
Amazing.
Zelda, be my partner.
Really?
But what about Pierre?
Pierre.
Ptoo!
Well, it would be an honour to work with one of the great minds of all time.
Maybe you shouldn't go back.
We can win a Nobel Prize.
I was planning on refinishing that floor anyway.
Hilda, dancing with you is like gliding on air.
- Only sweatier.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.
- You're graceful and witty.
- Oh!
I'm sorry, but you're not going back.
Hi, Sabrina.
This is Pierre.
- Are you okay?
You look tired.
- Bad night.
I think I'm just gonna curl up with a romance novel and some Epsom salts.
You too?
Wait, ho, never leave the house without a tissue, dear.
I left my lunch at home.
Wait a minute.
Heh.
Ah!
Yup, I thought so.
Fibre wafers.
Filling, and they keep things moving.
You're welcome.
These kids today have no home training.
Oh, Harvey, stand up straight.
- Have you been getting enough sleep?
- Hold still, you've got a little schmutz.
This isn't because we broke up, is it?
No, dear.
Heh.
I need a more mature man.
You're so cute.
- Hello?
- Did you get the photos?
Yes, and the ransom note too.
See, the problem is, I don't know you.
So I really don't care who took your cat.
But see, the cat is actually I don't think I thought this one through.
Stir that solution.
Get me the chloride.
Stop ordering me around.
Besides, you already spilled it on the floor.
And be careful because it's  Flammable.
Shouldn't you be cleaning?
You seem a little sluggish today.
Why don't we take a break.
Just until my feet stop bleeding.
Oh, please, we're just warming up.
I'm beginning to not like him.
She is destroying my lab, and I think she may have done some damage to my lungs.
Well, whether they like it or not, they are gonna sit down and talk.
What about Renee, Marianne, Michelle, you dance with them all.
Makes you feel special, huh?
What about Luc, Jean, Jean-Luc, Henri?
You're just jealous because he is the scientist you will never be.
- Ouch.
Your turn.
- I am going back to work.
Go back to work.
That is what you do best.
Work, work and more work.
How badly do we need radium?
Oh.
Tuck in your shirt, boy, you're at work.
Excuse me, ma'am, but we've cancelled our early bird special.
It's me.
Sabrina.
And that's a lovely name.
Would you like me to call Dial-A-Ride for you?
You're a real wisenheimer.
All right, look, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
You say you like me and I'm trying to show you that I'm mature--  You just don't seem interested.
I don't get it.
You are really scaring me, lady.
And I wore my cutest outfit.
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hi.
Hey, are you related to Sabrina Spellman?
Well, suddenly, everyone's a comedian.
I gotta get home.
My hammertoe is killing me.
Why don't I help you?
These sidewalks have broken hip written all over them.
It's our duty to get them back in time.
- We've got to think of something.
- I know.
When he's through arguing, he's gonna wanna dance again, and I can't take it.
What was that?
Maybe she killed him.
It was only a lamp.
- My vase.
- Oops.
- My little butterfingers.
- Butterbody.
I'm so much more comfortable with you than that tall blond.
Hilda.
The name's Hilda.
Let it go.
The freaks are back together.
I have to get a walker.
This lady said she lives here.
That's Sabrina's grandmother.
- I am not.
- She also thinks the war is still on.
Heh-heh.
Come on, Grammy.
Thanks for bringing her home.
Well, she reminded me of Sabrina.
What are you talking about?
I look darn cute.
She can't see her true reflection.
How could this happen?
I thought Oil of Old Age was supposed to be safe.
You're supposed to use it sparingly, unless this is the look you were going for.
Why would you do such a thing?
I was trying to look older so that Josh would be interested in me.
Oh, I've played that game.
I've changed myself into a princess, a farmer and a wombat.
Believe me, being a princess was the worst.
Did your age bring you any wisdom?
Yes.
I learned that I can't be what Josh wants me to be.
I have to be myself.
Although, the beds at the castle were comfy.
If Josh doesn't want you for who you are, then he's not who you're meant to be with.
I never had to work this hard with Harvey.
We were so comfortable together.
- And I enjoyed my steed.
- Stop it.
I miss Harvey.
It was nice of him to walk me home.
He's a nice boy.
Yeah, but he'll never wanna be with me if I smell like Vaporub.
Your youth isn't gone forever.
Drink this prune juice.
Do you think it's too late to cancel that adjustable bed?
Sabrinie, will you cut off my ear and place it in this envelope?
Gross.
What is your problem?
All right, all right.
It's for Paula Abdul.
I faked my own kidnapping so she would pay attention to me.
Does she know who you are?
Why does everyone think that's a necessary part of love?
Look, I learned the hard way.
It really is better to be honest.
Fine.
I'll try it your way.
But van Gogh really got the babes, right?
So wasn't that the weirdest allergic reaction ever?
You do seem better.
And I have to tell you that after trying to like philosophy and science fiction and everything else you like, I decided you were right to begin with.
- We are better off as friends.
- Friends.
So maybe sometime, we can do each other's hair?
Just friends, with a cute, smart, funny girl.
I'm an idiot.
Hey, have you seen Harvey?
I can't wait to make up with him.
Uh-oh.
See you at lunch.
All right.
- Who was that?
- Oh, that's Colette.
We're kind of seeing each other.
Oh, so you're doing okay?
Yeah, I'm doing okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
Yeah, see you.
Colette?
She doesn't look French to me.
I've lost Harvey forever.
Men.
"Dear Paula Abdul, sorry I lied about the free diamond giveaway, but thank you for coming to my house.
I have been going around doing things to try to impress you, but I've decided I just have to be who I am.
Hopefully, you will like that person.
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I'm very high up in the CIA.
Very high up".
Why do you keep staring at me?
"I can't meet with you, because I'm away on a dangerous mission.
But I would like you to comfort my cat".
SALEM : Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please.
Heh.
Oh, oh.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
- Good morning, Sabrina.
- Morning.
What will it be?
Egg-white omelette or oatmeal?
- Aah!
Okay, have a Pop-Tart.
No, it's your faces.
You all have Harvey's face.
Even the cat.
I am Harvey and I need 20 bucks.
I'm attracted to all of you, yet I'm repulsed.
Oh, make it stop.
Oh, honey, sometimes when a witch really loves someone and can't stop thinking about them, they literally see the object of their affection in other people's faces.
Yeah, happens to me all the time.
- Hi, baby.
Help.
All you have to do to make it stop is say out loud how you feel about Harvey.
I really love and miss Harvey.
Oh, much better.
- You want my mayonnaise?
- No.
Harvey would have.
He always liked my condiments.
Sometimes he'd even eat my garnish.
Oh, just take it.
There's Harvey.
- No Colette.
Go talk to him.
- All right, I'm going.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So how have you been?
Hi, guys.
Oh, Harvey, you left your chemistry book.
You forgot it in my locker.
Oops.
Forgot napkins.
Oh, you're sharing lockers now?
Well, I got a new plant.
A green one?
Oh, Harvey, my mom wants to know if you could bring a pumpkin pie to Thanksgiving dinner.
But we always have Thanksgiving at your-- - It's a philodendron.
Excuse me.
- Can I have your mayonnaise?
Sure.
- Sabrina, shouldn't you be in school?
- Oh, I just slipped away to shop.
You know, I've always wanted a fine timepiece.
What happened with Harvey now?
He's gonna go to Colette's for Thanksgiving.
I always went to his house.
Now where will I go?
What will become of me?
But I thought you always said Mrs. Kinkle's stuffing tasted like lumpy spackle.
Yes, but with gravy and Harvey, it was pretty good.
How could I have been so stupid?
I wish I had never kissed Josh.
I know.
I wish I had never kissed Estes Kefauver.
I wish things weren't so messed up with me and Harvey.
It may not be over between you.
Sometimes people just need a little time apart.
Try to remember, whatever happens, if it was meant to be, it will be.
And everything happens for a reason.
And safety first.
Okay, I need to work on my clichÃ©s.
One decaf cappuccino, coming right up.
This is our new drink, the foam-accino.
Harvey, I was just not thinking about you.
- Hey, listen, we need to talk.
- Really?
Yeah, but it's pretty busy in here.
Maybe it's not a good time.
I guess I didn't hear the ice-cream truck.
So, what did you wanna talk about?
Well, last night I was looking at all this stuff that I have that reminds me of you.
You were?
I was too.
So you agree that now that we're broken up, we should give all that stuff back to each other?
Absolutely, that's just what I was thinking.
Well, look at the crowd.
I should get back to work.
Hey, aren't those the people that just left?
They check out the competition, they always come back.
- His letterman's jacket.
No.
Pictures.
The hat he made me in wood shop.
Please just talk to him.
He's good people.
He's moved on.
We've moved on.
There's nothing left to talk about.
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.
Harvey's just not the right guy for me.
Oh, so you still wanna date Josh?
No, but the whole thing with Josh made me realise that, well, what I want is a college guy.
Yeah, a college guy.
Yeah, somebody cool, and  Harvey's just not that cool.
Oh-ho.
I always thought I'd be Harvey's best man at your wedding.
Hilda, Zelda, it's so sad.
- We have a surprise.
We're going to cook Thanksgiving dinner.
Turkey, stuffing and gravy?
- Lots of gravy?
- Mm-hm.
You never celebrated Thanksgiving before.
Well, we've decided to put our hard feelings towards those poopie, old, witch-hating Pilgrims aside.
Now, Hilda.
We realise that it was more important to cheer up someone we love than to hold a grudge, against those poopie old Pilgrims.
You guys are the best.
We're doing this for Sabrina.
If it involves gravy, you can do it for Moms Mabley for all I care.
Well, here's your stuff.
Yeah, here's yours.
Oh, my Hootie & The Blowfish CD.
Oh.
Here's your lip gloss.
Guess my books won't smell like Strawberry Swirl anymore.
Thanks.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Yep.
So see you.
Yeah, see you.
Bye.
Bye.
I can't believe it wasn't meant to be.
He's keeping her picture.
So guy, Dreama, I can't believe he actually kept her picture.
That means he totally still likes her.
But Sabrina doesn't think Harvey's cool enough.
Please, she's my friend, but she just doesn't get it.
Don't tell her I said that.
Girlfriend, it's up to you.
Put a magic thermometer spell on Harvey and make him kill.
I'll do it.
Not before you rinse me.
Gah.
"Reach hand in cavity, loosen and remove giblets and gizzard".
- Go ahead, Zellie.
- You go ahead.
I unwrapped the foul fowl.
Who came up with this stupid rule that witches have to make Thanksgiving dinner by hand?
Stupid witches.
They're just trying to discourage us from celebrating Thanksgiving.
Well, it's working.
Come on, we have to do this for Sabrina.
- Let's just leave the gizzard.
- Mm.
What's next?
"Salt and pepper to taste".
This is hard.
Okay, Harvey, be cool.
I am so out of here.
Cool.
Sabrina, you have to talk to Harvey.
Oh, man, you're like a dog with a bone.
Harvey and I have given back our relationship stuff.
We have closure.
- Trust me, Harvey's changed.
- We have closure.
Why'd he keep a picture of you in his locker?
Closure.
He kept my picture?
Did I also win a Nobel Prize you didn't tell me about?
I've gotta talk to him.
Oh.
Hey, Harvey.
- Yo, Brina.
- Brina?
Look, do you think we could talk?
What do you call what we're doing right now?
It's the Kink Man.
- Harvey just blew me off.
- But isn't he cool?
Are you responsible for the rebel without a clue?
I guess, but I thought you wanted him to be different.
No, I was just rationalising to get through this lonely, desperate time.
Oh.
Hey.
Gotta stop him before he starts looking for Potsie.
Okay, okay, I'll warm him up.
I don't want no stinking fish sticks.
Too hot.
You've turned him into a hothead.
Hey, what are you looking at, freckle boy?
Oh, it's time I take matters in my own finger.
Wait, Clarence.
You dropped your PokÃ©mon cards.
There.
Perfect temperature.
Hi, Harvey.
Oh, hi, Colette.
Mind if I walk you to class?
I'm so glad I arranged that for her.
These recipes are so involved.
Why don't we make our own traditional Thanksgiving foods?
Great idea.
How about microwave popcorn?
Yes, we'll put it in a casserole and melt miniature marshmallows on top.
It's too bad you're being sarcastic because that sounds kind of good.
Okay, lunch is almost over, so I don't have much time.
I was wondering if you knew a fix-a-broken-love spell?
Oh, sure, honey.
It's filed right next to the make-life-perfect spell.
Oh, I could use that too.
Sabrina, you know you can't use magic for love.
- Oh, what can I use magic for?
Trust me.
In matters of the heart, the mortal way is the magic way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's always so satisfying when I get through to her.
Check this out in the witches' cookbook.
"Have a homemade traditional Thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings in just one easy step".
Wonderful.
We'll have an authentic Thanksgiving dinner made by hand.
Just not our hands.
Okay, Harvey, we need to talk.
- Colette, we need to talk.
- Sure, what is it?
You're really nice, but this relationship doesn't feel that comfortable to me.
And I think it would be better if we stopped seeing each other.
Yes.
You're breaking up with me so you can get back with Sabrina, aren't you?
- Yes.
- It's not that.
I mean, I still love and care about her, but I don't know if I can ever forgive Sabrina for what she did.
No.
If you want him to forgive you, just say you're sorry.
Look, I totally betrayed him.
I can't just walk up to him and say, "Sorry".
- But if you-- - You don't know how he said it.
Look, I'll just show you.
I don't know if I can ever forgive Sabrina for what she did.
Ouch.
Harvey's never said anything like that before.
Colette, I never meant to hurt you.
Oh, I really need to remember to turn off my radio soaps.
I hope our kitchen meets all your culinary needs.
Mother, my eyes vex me.
We should never have partaken of that evil weed.
Yes.
Wretched tobacco.
Now don't be vexed.
How about I get some tea for thee?
The mortal way.
They're Pilgrims.
Of course.
Hot tea coming right up.
Witch, witch.
They don't exactly think outside the box, do they?
There's got to be a spell to make Harvey forgive me.
Sabrina, maybe you should listen to your aunts' advice: - "The mortal way is the magic way".
- Here's one.
"If you've done something wrong in a relationship, start over by going back to the drawing board".
Or you could just ignore the cat.
All I need to do is fill in our thought bubbles with what I want us to say.
Let's see, I'll say, "Can you forgive and forget"?
And Harvey will say, "All is forgiven and forgotten".
Now we'll all live happily ever after.
Wish me luck.
Hey, you should try to get on The Simpsons.
Harvey, can you forgive and forget?
All is forgiven and forgotten.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You are?
- Sabrina.
- And I am?
Okay, back to the drawing board.
Let's see, to err is human, to forgive, divine.
This one will work.
So to err is human.
Why, these fish sticks are simply divine.
I must forgive the lunch lady for wreaking havoc with my waistline.
Hmm.
Sabrina, your outfit, divine.
Apparently, with this board, you have to choose your words carefully.
So something simple and heartfelt.
Harvey, let go and let God.
- Yes, my child?
- Shoot.
Oh.
Sorry, Father.
Okay, I got the perfect idea.
Hey, I was gonna use that board to mend the rift between me and Yvonne De Carlo.
John, Mary, aren't we overreacting just a bit?
- You're witches, admit it.
- All right, if you insist.
Oh, merciful heaven.
You know, for people who crossed the Atlantic and fought Indians, you're kind of fraidy-cats.
Come on, we just need you to make Thanksgiving dinner.
It would mean so much to our niece.
So if we prepare a feast for you, you'll send us home?
Quicker than you can say cornucopia.
Aunt Hilda and Zelda, I need to talk to you.
Away from Mr. and Mrs. Quaker Oats.
Wait, somebody has to watch the Pilgrims.
Witch, witch.
Pilgrim, Pilgrim.
John, Mary, this is our very friendly talking cat, Salem.
He'll help you get started.
If he tries to repress your freedom of religion, just spray him with a water bottle.
I realised that I can't use this spell to make Harvey to forgive me.
So are you gonna try it the mortal way?
No, I wanted to know if I could borrow your magic lost-in-time clock.
Have to admit, she's tenacious.
I wanna go back to that night.
I won't kiss Josh and Harvey won't be hurt.
Please, I really need a second chance.
I am the most powerful of all witches.
And I will only be appeased by gravy.
Stir faster or I'll turn you into toads.
- Unleash not your anger.
- We stir, sir.
Well, I'm off to right a wrong.
Now, how do I do this?
"You make a left turn at yesterday and then go forward toward the past".
If you need me, I'll be on our porch two weeks ago.
Good luck.
Well, I guess while we're waiting, - I could look at your bookkeeping.
- What bookkeeping?
Cool.
Oh, so, what was I saying?
If everyone would just buy a goat, then we could eliminate leaf blowers and stop global warming.
Well, here we are.
- Thanks for helping me study.
- You're welcome.
And you can admit I'm right about the goat thing later.
Sorry, Josh, but I have a really wonderful boyfriend, Harvey.
And if I kiss you, that will hurt Harvey and that would ruin our relationship forever.
I wouldn't want you to do anything you may later regret.
Thank you for being so understanding.
- You don't look sick to me.
- Harvey, wait.
I'm rewriting history here.
This stupid clock is broken.
I went back in time and it still ruined things with Harvey.
Oh, honey, when the past refuses to change, it means what happened was meant to be.
Why would that be meant to be?
What good could come of this?
We never said something good would come of it.
So it's really over between Harvey and me?
Oh, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just gonna do some stuff on my school paper and bury myself in my work.
I don't need love.
Tsk.
Mm.
I hope she still needs turkey.
Oh, right.
Turkey.
I wonder how Salem's doing with those Pilgrims.
I must taste everything.
Nothing leaves this kitchen until it passes my lips.
Mm-hm-mm.
A little too spicy.
Mm.
Yee!
Too bland.
Mm.
Not just right.
Need I remind you the penalty for displeasing me?
Toads.
Then be done with it.
We prefer that to this oppression.
Go ahead, use your magic, witch.
Uh-oh.
You don't wanna cook me.
I'm awful gamy.
Okay, this is not how we left things.
He is an abomination.
Oh, so you've had time to get to know each other.
More importantly, how's the meal coming?
Hear ye, hear ye.
We quit.
Wait.
Look, maybe we've asked of you without giving anything in return.
Yeah, if you cook for us, we'll zap you anything you want.
A new horse?
A winter coat?
Witch, witch.
Yes, we've established that we're witches.
- So do we have a deal?
Good wife.
Look at the strong haunches on that horse.
You know, we could use a new feather bed.
And a bed warmer.
I want a real pewter one like the Joneses' next door.
They're awfully greedy for Puritans.
We'll give you whatever you want.
Just cook.
This shall be a Thanksgiving like no other.
Absolutely.
No dysentery this time.
Heh-heh.
Okay, we'll get out of your way.
Hey, isn't someone gonna untie the cat?
Oh, sorry.
Are you sorry?
Yes, very.
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
I'm so glad to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't say I was sorry sooner.
But I'm sorry.
None of this would have happened if I hadn't of taken you for granted and spent all my time with Brad and the guys.
I'm sorry I thought I wanted to date Josh.
I'm sorry I dated Josh.
I'm sorry to keep bringing it up.
And I'm sorry for saying I'd call at 8:15 but I didn't call till 8:20.
And I'm sorry I ate the last Milk Dud at the movies.
- Boy, I've really missed you.
- I've missed you too.
You know, I thought I couldn't forgive you, but sometimes I feel like I'm under your spell.
I guess sometimes the mortal way is the magic way.
- What?
- You don't have to agree with me.
So do you wanna come over for a traditional Thanksgiving?
I thought your aunts don't cook Thanksgiving dinner.
Oh, that's the tradition.
So will you do me the honour of taking back all of my junk?
If you'll take mine.
Hey, you varnished it.
Yeah, my dad sprayed it, so no termites.
I thought of another way for you and Harvey to get back together.
Never mind.
I knew there was someone I was supposed to call.
Thanksgiving dinner is served.
Oh, boy, your caterers really go all out.
I know why that thing with Josh was meant to be.
It made me appreciate how much Harvey means to me.
And I know another reason why the whole Josh thing was meant to be.
I found out I really like Thanksgiving.
Come on, you two.
Everyone, please enjoy.
Witch, witch.
Sorry, habit.
Okay, let's go around the table and say what we're thankful for.
Okay, I'm thankful for family.
I'm thankful to you guys for doing this.
More yams.
Did your cat just say, "More yams"?
Come on, you guys, dance, loosen up.
It's not immoral.
Just fun.
Oh, come on.
It will help you digest your food.
Live a little.
It's a holiday.
Go, Pilgrims.
Go, Pilgrims.
Go, Pilgrims.
Go, Pilgrims.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Good morning to all creatures, great and small.
You're in a frothy mood.
Yeah, well, Harvey promised me a romantic surprise for this weekend.
- Ooh.
- Another heart-shaped corn dog?
- Hey, that was good.
- When he says romantic, does he mean Brad-free?
Yep, just me, my guy and no witch-hunter.
And if dinner comes on a stick, it's fine with me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Enough chick talk.
Sabrina, as man of the house, I must insist you let me spend the weekend watching rooting-tooting Westerns on your TV.
Salem, your approach is as pathetic as it is appalling, but here's how good a mood I'm in.
Dee-- Gah?
Yes.
Cowpokes.
Cattle.
Manly men in mortal combat with even manlier men.
Oh, these pillows are cuddly soft.
Ready for your romantic surprise?
- Reassure me it doesn't involve Brad.
- Only indirectly.
You promised it was just gonna be us this weekend.
- Brad's lending me his skis.
- But you-- Skis?
As in, we're going skiing?
One of my dad's extermination customers owns a mountain cabin.
He's giving it to us for the weekend.
I never knew pest control could lead to such romance.
Mm.
Powdery slopes, warm firesides, whispering pines.
- And, of course, my mom and dad.
- Of course.
We can drive up together tomorrow after school, just the two of us.
My folks are going up tonight so my dad can kill the roaches.
So we don't have to drive in the back of the station waggon with the smell?
This is by far the most romantic idea you've ever had.
Thank you.
Hot coffee.
- What happened?
- Wow, lively floorboard.
Did you see that?
No, no, no.
Sabrina.
She did something.
She's all the way across the room.
Of all the coffee houses in all the towns in all the world, that witch-hunter has to walk into mine.
You don't have to loiter nervously in the hallway making small talk with my aunts, because I am entirely ready.
Great.
There was one tiny problem, but it's already solved.
Hey.
- Brad?
He's gonna drive us up to the mountains, turn around and drive all the way back.
- Is that a friend or what?
- I'll go get your stuff.
It's better than not going, right?
I got a date with Susan McCormick tonight and her curfew is 10:30.
So if we leave right now, I can get back in time for a good solid 20-minute date.
You know what, I'm not as ready as I thought I was.
I'll be right back.
Ten-minute date.
I'm gonna be in the car with Brad for two hours.
- What if I use my magic?
- What if you don't?
But what if I point without thinking, like I did at the coffee house?
All Brad has to do is look at me and say, "You're a witch".
And I could turn into a mouse for a hundred years.
Aunt Zelda, Aunt Hilda, I think I'm lost.
- Don't panic.
- Oh, I'm way past panic and looking for a parking space near terror.
Since Brad's witch-hunter gene is affected by atmospheric conditions, I suggest we consult The Witch Weather Channel.
Hey.
Let's see.
Factoring in high and low pressure systems, the magnetic influence of the asteroid belt and the pollen count, unless things shift drastically, Brad's witch-hunting gene won't be active for the next 72 hours.
And it looks like a good weekend to plant bulbs.
We interrupt this pabulum to return to the Howard Hawks classic, Rio Bravo.
I'm sure it's safe for you to ride with Brad, and even safe to use your magic.
Just be careful.
But as an extra safety precaution, take Salem with you.
SALEM AND  Salem?
Oh, throw the witch-hunter off with a talking cat?
It's hard to believe, but Salem was an experienced witch for many years.
And as a cat, he's particularly sensitive to subtle changes in the atmosphere.
And we get rid of him for the whole weekend.
But I haven't seen Angie Dickinson yet.
- You're bringing your cat?
- Uh Yeah, allergies.
He needs mountain air.
His poor lungs, clogged with pollution.
Date with Susan McCormick.
Let's move it.
Wear your seat belts.
Observe all posted traffic signs.
And watch for ice, and don't pass on mountain roads.
Have fun?
Well, that's implied.
You know, Hilda, Brad's witch-hunting gene has set me thinking.
What if Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune were all to align within the ninth parallel of the seventh quadrant, and we lose all our powers?
That happens once a millennium.
Yes, but what if it happened and then there was a flood?
We have no idea how to survive a natural disaster without magic.
I can't even make an English muffin without magic.
Precisely.
Which is why I think we should prepare now before a disaster occurs.
It's like the story of the ant and the grasshopper.
- Oh, I don't know that story.
- Of course you know that story.
There was this hard-working ant and this lazy, lazy grasshopper, and winter was coming.
I lied and I left and it still didn't stop her.
Nobody's saying anything.
Guys just don't say much when they ride in cars together.
- Why?
- Are you gonna talk the whole way?
It's better than not going.
- Radio's busted.
- Oh, maybe I can fix it.
Unless there's some change in atmospheric conditions that would make it unsafe to fix the radio.
Here goes nothing.
Nice.
How'd you do that?
I'm sorry.
I don't talk in cars.
Now that you got that working, I can listen to my favourite show.
- Sox Talk.
- And nothing but.
RADIO  --another great Red Sox season.
I've grown accustomed to the couch, but this might be interesting.
I'm practising, in case we're ever caught somewhere without our magic, and we have to construct our own shelter.
- Where'd you get the tent?
- I zapped it in.
The stores were closed.
But we're going to pitch it ourselves.
No, you're going to pitch it.
I'm going to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and wait from you to recover from your episode.
I can see my breath.
Can you turn on the heat?
Heater's busted.
Maybe Sabrina can fix it.
She fixed your radio.
- Hey, what are those sparks?
- Static electricity?
- No way, it came out of your finger.
- Hey, Brad, look out.
Is everybody okay?
I didn't hear a voice say, "Go into the light, Sabrina," so I guess I'm fine.
Let's go see what's wrong.
Did you see that?
You did something with your finger.
Oh, so now I can't pick my nose or talk?
What happened?
According to my bum knee, there was an atmospheric shift.
The witch-hunter gene is active.
- You never should have tried magic.
- But you were supposed to warn me.
I was supposed to be in the middle of Stagecoach right now.
Hey, who are you arguing with?
Uh The radio.
I think the Red Sox will win the pennant.
- You didn't even try to help me.
- I'm leaving that to your therapist.
Oh, come on.
You'll love what I've done with the place.
Oh, well, this is kind of cosy.
I wonder what it's like with the door closed all the way.
A body bag.
If you don't like my life-saving tent, you can leave.
The zipper's stuck.
- You can't do anything for yourself.
- Oh, I'll just zap it open.
No, we can figure it out.
Oh, I see, the scientific approach.
Is that cat crying?
No, that's its meow.
I got it at a really cheap pet store.
Zap in a magic compass or a helicopter or at least warm socks.
I can't do magic.
I could be turned into a mouse.
Then we're going to die.
Hey, look.
A fire tower.
There's gotta be a forest ranger up there, or at least a phone.
This looks kind of old.
Well, if you big, strong men are scared, I'll just go up by myself.
- I'm not scared.
- Me either.
Great.
It's abandoned.
Not necessarily.
Maybe the ranger is just a terrible housekeeper.
Uh I have to go down.
I forgot something.
- What?
- I forgot I'm afraid of heights.
Okay, okay, we're trapped and we're way off the ground.
Hang in there, man.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
What was that?
Me.
But I'll pull myself together.
I know, let's go to the kitchen and get a knife and cut ourselves out.
I'll wait here.
No-oh!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
No-oh!
Ugh!
Oh, just zap it.
Oh.
- See, you needed magic, didn't you?
Oh, pipe down.
Not you.
Depending, of course, on who you are.
Perhaps you need to pipe down.
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha!
- Look, who are you?
- Frank Alcerro, Brad's father.
I've called five times, but there was no answer.
What's with the tent?
We were practising our survival techniques.
We had no idea what a hostile environment our living room could be.
Try the Mekong Delta.
I've heard about this house.
People say a lot of weird things go on here.
I think what you heard is weird people say things go on here.
What can we do for you, Mr. Alcerro?
We got a call from the Kinkles.
The kids are late getting to the cabin.
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sure it's fine.
We called the sheriff.
No deaths reported.
- Hooray.
- He's gonna keep an eye out.
Don't think you need to worry.
Got coffee?
Sure.
- Black?
- And real.
I don't go for that wimpy decaf stuff.
Same here.
The hard stuff for me, out of a dirty mug.
Excuse us.
I'll just zap myself to Sabrina and make sure she's okay.
Ow!
Hilda, that is Brad's father out there.
Brad is a witch-hunter.
That means his father probably has the witch-hunting gene.
He's already suspicious of us.
Perhaps because we're camping next to our piano.
The weather must have changed.
We can't risk doing magic, or  Maybe you're right about him.
You think?
What are we supposed to do?
Just stand around and worry like ordinary mortals?
That blows.
Help!
- Help!
It's no use.
There's no one around.
And it's getting colder.
We should have stayed in the truck.
At least it's got a heater and a radio.
Thanks to me.
How long did those soccer players have to stay in the Andes before they started eating each other?
No heat, no blankets.
We'll freeze to death.
Why didn't I eat more NutRageous bars when I had the chance?
Bloody nose.
Must be the high altitude.
Hey, look.
Maybe we can call for help on this.
Great, it's busted.
Hey, maybe Sabrina can fix it.
She fixed the radio in your car.
Come on, you're our only hope.
Great.
I get to disappoint everyone, then die.
Please help yourself to our phone.
I just talked to Kinkle again.
No sign of the kids.
I think I'll drive up there.
I don't like to sit around and wait for trouble to happen.
What a refreshing attitude.
Besides, this old dump gives me the creeps.
It seems to attract them.
Mr. Alcerro, please wait.
Let him go, and when he's gone, we'll zap ourselves to Sabrina.
But what if we materialise right next to Brad?
He'd identify us as witches and we'd all be turned into mice.
Bad plan.
Sabrina is all alone up there with a witch-hunter and another one is on the way.
We've gotta go up there to protect her.
Mr. Alcerro, we're going with you.
- Bring some gas money.
- I'll stay here and fold up the tent.
Oh.
Well, I thought you two wanted to be alone together.
Try sparking those two wires together.
The whole thing would be on fire.
And we'd be warm.
Hey, any luck?
Brad thinks one of his toes feels frostbitten.
I suppose that's my fault too?
I'm not interested in whose fault this is.
If you wanna get technical, it was your idea to climb up.
It wasn't my idea to go skiing, and it wasn't my car that wouldn't start.
Again, I'm not interested in blaming anyone.
My paw has turned black.
Your paw's always black.
- Daar!
- I can't get this stupid thing to work.
It's working.
Huh.
And they say violence never solves anything.
Relax, ladies.
I'm ready for anything in this baby.
Well, that's good to hear.
You know, I've been trying to impress upon my sister the importance of being prepared for disaster.
I've got enough food to last four months in this rig.
Oh, great, so if we get hit by an asteroid right now, we'd die with enough powdered milk to last until April.
- Hello, is anybody there?
BOY : Hello?
- Hey, we got someone.
- See?
She's not gonna get us killed.
We're stuck in an abandoned fire tower and we need to talk to your mother or your father, depending on your family situation.
I'm not supposed to play with this radio.
- If I do, my dad yells.
- But this is an emergency.
We're stuck, we're freezing and we can't get down.
You're yelling at me.
Over and out.
Don't yell at me.
Why are we stopping?
Did we get a flat in our giant tyres?
No.
I have to put the chains on.
Can you leave the heater on, while you go out there?
Yeah, I got a cracked vertebrae.
Either you two put them on, or we turn back.
Oh, good.
Since we can't use our magic, this will be an excellent learning experience.
Just so you know, I'm not getting you anything for your birthday.
My lungs have never been cold before.
- I think we should share the cat.
No.
No, he has issues with men.
You know, you could be a little nicer to Brad.
After all, it's not his fault we're up here.
I wish I had never agreed to this stupid trip.
I wish I never asked you on this stupid trip.
You know, this is definitely not better than not going.
We're going down.
We did it.
I feel such a sense of accomplishment.
We're empowered now, Hilda.
We'll never be stuck in the snow again.
Ha-ha.
Okay, fire her up.
Aah!
And nothing for Christmas.
- Don't move.
- I'm sorry we had a fight.
I am too.
If I have to fall to an untimely death in the middle of nowhere, I'd rather do it with you than anyone else.
Except maybe a paramedic.
- Salem, freeze.
- Wow, that's a well-trained cat.
You've made it clear that you don't wanna stop, but do you think that we could use one of your 200 rolls of toilet paper to dry off with?
Nope, don't wanna break the seal.
Aah!
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Do you have a rag we could use?
Sure.
Thank you so very much.
Imagine the flies you can catch with that rag.
Hold on.
What am I gonna do?
I can't cast a spell.
I'll be turned into a mouse for a hundred years.
This is it.
We're going over.
That's it, I gotta save you guys.
I don't care what happens to me.
I promise, while you're a mouse, I won't eat you.
- Is everyone okay?
- Fine.
Wow, the snow must have broken our fall.
But we fell 50 feet.
How can we all be fine?
- Clean living.
- No, no, no.
This is all too weird.
First, you fixed my radio without even using any tools.
When she fixed my heater, I swear I saw sparks fly out of her finger.
Oh, and you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
And I swear that darn cat of hers was talking.
And then the whole tower blows over and we come out of it without a scratch?
It was kind of like a miracle.
Well, then we should all bow our heads and give thanks.
It wasn't a miracle.
It was like magic.
Like Sabrina has some sort of magical powers.
Talk about overreacting to your brush with death, huh?
So you're not Sabrina's mother, you're her aunt, huh?
- That's right.
- I know how that can be.
I'm Brad's stepfather.
But I raised him from a baby.
- Stepfather?
- You're not Brad's biological father?
That's wonderful.
Hey, I am capable of being a biological father.
Oh, of course.
So he doesn't have the witch-hunter gene.
So we can use magic to save Sabrina.
I know what you are.
Sabrina Spellman, you are a-- What's that light?
It's the moon.
I guess the weather's clearing up.
What was I about to say?
- Look, headlights.
- Somebody's here.
We're saved.
It's your dad and Sabrina's aunts.
Wait, it's like the moonlight wiped out my memory.
What was I about to say?
I can't remember.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
But don't worry.
You'll get over it.
I always do.
- Hey, over here.
- That was close.
You know, you save a guy's life and he turns on you.
I'm glad we screwed up his date.
So you changed the weather and that turned off the witch-hunter gene?
Yes, we used our magic to save you.
But we were able to help because we took the precaution of coming up here.
- But we used our magic.
- But we prepared for disaster.
Can I say something?
Thank you for rescuing me.
Oh, you're welcome, sweetheart.
We'd do anything for you, Sabrina.
You know that.
May I say something?
I want my Westerns.
Oh, yes.
MAN : That concludes our Western marathon.
Please stay tuned for classic romance.
First up, The Other Side of the Mountain.
Ooh.
Marilyn Hassett alert.
I know you and Brad don't get along too well, but you have to admit, it was pretty cool of him to drive home with his dad and your aunts and let us have his truck.
And now we can have the romantic weekend we were hoping for.
With my mom and dad.
Hey, it's better than not going.
Now, if I could just find the turnoff for the cabin on this dark road.
Oh, hey, look.
Brad has a satellite navigation system.
We take the next left.
Wow, I cannot believe he forgot he had that.
Yeah, well, you know, Harvey, I have to tell you the truth: Brad is weird.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
How about a neurosurgeon?
No, thanks.
I'm in a toast mood.
Salem's filling out a questionnaire for his high school reunion.
Apparently, it's a work of fiction.
"I perform lobotomies in the off season when I'm not playing free safety for the Dallas Cowboys".
You left out where you sit around - and scratch your butt.
- This reunion's gonna be great.
Seeing all my old cronies.
Pretending I know about the brain.
How are you gonna explain the fact that you have four legs, pointy ears, and a furry belly, Mr. Convicted Felon?
I got it all figured out.
No one will care that I slipped up playing the morality game as long as I walk into that reunion with a gorgeous trophy on my arm.
Allow me.
I meant Susan Anton.
So it's my first issue as newspaper editor.
So I need a lead story that's explosive, that's exclusive.
Something that's front-page material.
Well, I'm willing to give you an inside scoop on the football team.
I've made the first string of people who are up for the first string.
Congratulations.
But what I need is a war.
Hey, what are you doing?
I did a kiss-me spell.
It's a fast and easy way to make mortal friends.
Yeah, if you wanna be called fast and easy.
Ms. Editor, have we got a headline yet?
Oh, my.
A public display of affection, although never practised in my family, is healthy.
Tell no one.
See, in the mortal realm, making friends takes time.
That girl has got lots of friends.
Ms. Spellman.
Ms. New Girl.
Loitering in the hallway.
Loitering next to Ms. Spellman.
You know, I should get these detention slips printed up with your letterhead.
A Montblanc pen?
Where'd you get that?
At the none-of-your-business store.
I'm cruising to find a date for the reunion.
The babes love a sports car.
They particularly like one they can fit in.
You know nothing about women.
I don't get it.
My doctor says I'm anaemic, but I've been eating all this red meat.
It looks more like blue-grey meat.
Is it just me, or has the cafeteria food gotten worse this year?
It's not just you.
So, what do you think about this for my front page?
It's completely blank, except for the headline which reads: "No news is good news".
If you decide to go with the me-maybe-making-first-string story, I'll be available for photos.
I'll have my people call your people.
Should meat sweat like that?
Dreama, what happened?
I'm not really hurt, but look at all the friends I've got.
And I might even get handicapped parking.
Dreama, there's more to life than getting into 7-Eleven before everyone else.
Sorry, I should have zapped in a pillow.
Wow, nice running shoes, and pricey.
Mm-hm.
The better to chase you with, my dear.
No gum chewing.
Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
- What does this look like to you?
- Drain clog?
Bad toupee?
This is what Harvey was eating for lunch.
You're never having dinner at the Kinkles again.
Come on, we've gotta get to our Witch Watch Workshops.
Ready?
We found out from the Witches' Council that we have to be trained and licensed to run the clock shop.
Well, good luck, and try not to come home while I'm throwing my huge party.
Very funny.
While we're gone, will you keep an eye on Salem?
Why?
He's a grown cat.
He's having trouble finding a date for this reunion.
And I think it's depressing him.
Salem, are you okay?
I was fine until you stepped on my nah-nah's.
I have six dates for tonight.
Driving the prison van does not constitute a date.
No, I put an ad in the Other Realm personals.
I'm meeting six ladies.
And I have to decide which one is gonna be Salem's arm candy for the reunion.
We didn't have any iced tea.
Is that a purse?
It's European.
Get some culture.
Mrs. Quick, I've got a story for the front page.
I'm all ears, Sabrina.
Day after day, I watch my boyfriend eat massive quantities of so-called red meat from the cafeteria.
I know you're young and in love.
- But give me a headline I can use.
- Cafeteria-gate.
There's no ham in the burger, no meat in the loaf, and no sloppy in the Joe.
- Well, you know what I mean.
- A meat scandal.
Perfect, we'll blow the lid off this school right after the pep rally.
Just as I suspected, there is no meat in this Salisbury steak.
But there is a family of paramecia, and even they're gagging.
Can I have my lunch back?
Sabrina, remember how you were looking for the lead to break your lunchroom story?
- Yeah?
- I've got it, baby.
Walk.
Don't run.
Ooh, I can see the headlines now, "Kraft Gets Chair".
Open your eyes, girl.
He's only a civil servant.
And there ain't no budget for a Chippendale settee.
If the school money isn't going to buy meat, then it must be going to Mr. Kraft.
Be my friend.
Be my friend.
I have a pool.
Salem, I'm checking on you like I promised my aunts.
"Forget my name.
I've joined the French Foreign Legion.
Love, Salem".
I over-packed my pack.
I'm really busy at school, so if you're gonna run off to Algeria, - wait until my aunts come home.
- I can't find a date for the reunion.
So?
You'll go stag.
I'm sure you can pick up some neglected wife at the bar.
You can't cheer me up, Sabrina.
There's something you don't know.
I wasn't always the stud muffin I am today.
I was a high school nerd.
Do the:  And I'll tell you all about it.
Billy Luto, you let me down.
Salem is a weenie.
We hung him by his Heenie.
ALL : Salem is a weenie.
We hung him by his No.
The flashbacks.
Wow, for the first time you seem so vulnerable.
I so wanted to go back to school a winner.
But, Salem, you are a winner, you've got-- Well, there's-- What about--?
You know what, Salem.
I promise, I will find you a date for the reunion.
A trophy date.
Sometimes, it's hard to make new friends.
Maybe you have an ex-girlfriend you wanna take.
Great idea.
I had a million of them.
That's why your little black book is practically the size of the New York phone book.
What about Sarah Phillips?
I'd love to go with her.
She was always so sweet, so warm, so nurturing.
So desperate for commitment.
Not to be picky, but how about someone for whom dating doesn't constitute adultery?
Well, I don't know how to make out her last name.
But what about Hallie?
Yeah, she was drop-dead gorgeous.
I wonder why we ever broke up.
Hey, Salem.
Now I remember.
Hallie Tosis.
Her breath could start the windmill on an old Dutch painting.
That's the only other name in here except for Mom.
Ink fades.
Well, I have to get back to school and crack the Mr. Kraft case.
Because Salem needs a date Really fast Send him someone He truly loved from the past.
From your Harold and Maude phase?
Oh, don't be sick.
She's a lady who was handing out fish yesterday.
Well, I'll find you a date as soon as I get back from school.
Got any trout on you?
Oh, I'm so glad we got into Father Time's Workshop.
It's supposed to be very intellectual.
I know, I know.
He's going to teach us to "be the clock".
Trust me.
You'll be glad you stuck it out.
Oh, yeah, I'm really glad we stuck it out.
There's got to be some proof he's funnelling the money.
Yeah, some kind of an invoice, or a phone message or a pacifier.
Oh, the horror.
- Hey, what are doing--?
- Mr. Kraft.
Oh, we just wanted to show you Mrs. Quick's new camera.
Show him, Mrs. Quick.
Okay.
Well, we'll see you on the way down.
I mean, later.
Hey, Sabrina.
I read that pets are the best way to meet people.
- I love your kitty.
- It's working.
Okay, where's my 50 bucks?
She talks?
And if you want her to stop, it's 50 bucks.
Oh, sorry.
She was supposed to keep her furry mouth shut.
She only thinks about herself.
Really?
That self-centred?
Is she single?
You wanna set me up with this pinhead?
Somebody's cranky, because they got hit in the face with a frying pan.
Oh, I must have entered a wit-free zone.
What a disaster.
What a woman.
You graduated from Other Realm High the year before me?
Wait a minute.
Juliette Jingleheimer, the prom queen?
In person, so to speak.
Salem, why don't you tell Juliette about some of your hobbies?
Psst, psst.
I can strut my own stuff.
I like fish.
So are you working on the homework?
Yup.
The Kraft true confessions potion is brewing.
Great.
Tomorrow, you'll slip him the mickey, and he'll confess, and I'll have my story.
And there's no way we could get arrested for this?
There's no way I could be arrested.
Juliette, we have to get home.
But wait.
Juliette, I know we haven't known each other very long, and How do I?
I was wondering if I Would you come with me to my reunion?
- Why not?
- Bye.
Glory be, I have a date, and not just any date.
She's the coolest gal from Other Realm High.
- And you owe it all to me.
- Exactly.
And that's why I'm going to warn you that I'm about to sing "Lady".
- So you gave Mr. Kraft the potion?
- Yes, I slipped it into his V8 juice.
Great, so he's ready to confess, and met his vegetable requirement.
Here he is.
Let's go.
Mr. Kraft, is there anything you'd like to confess about the meat in the cafeteria?
Pardon me.
Let me guess.
You put the confession potion together in one big horse pill.
How'd you know?
Go make some more friends.
Sabrina, good news.
I've been contacted by a secret informant.
This person works in the cafeteria and goes by the name of Sore Throat.
- When and where can we meet him?
- Tonight in the cafeteria.
Mr. Kraft will rue the day he ever - Did the bell ring?
- About ten seconds ago.
Shoot.
Salem, what are you holding?
It better not be another subpoena.
It's a letter from my lady, Juliette.
She's crazy about me.
"Salem, remember to get my kidney pÃ¢tÃ©".
Well, I guess for a cat, that's romantic.
It's not what she said, but that she took the time to say it.
Man, you got it bad.
Behold the manifestation of my affection.
"S.S. plus J. squiggly line"?
My affection is endless, but my nails are not.
Hello, honey.
Is there any reason you two are dressed like the Ricola man?
Dear Lord, we were in such a hurry to get out of there, we left on our lederhosen.
They're deceptively comfortable.
Oh, a corsage.
Anything for my dear Juliette.
This kitten is smitten.
I found Salem a date for the reunion.
Way to go, honey.
You didn't pay anyone, did you?
Hey, she can spend her allowance any way that she likes.
Let's get this business licence in the toaster.
What's that?
We spent the day in a clock, and we developed a low-grade tick.
Okay, I'm just gonna nod and pretend to understand.
Okay, close your eyes.
Thanks, Sabrina.
Wait till that rotten Billy Luto sees me walk into that reunion with the prom queen on my arm, Juliette.
Open up.
So just out of curiosity, why was Juliette turned into a cat?
I only tried to take over the world.
She tried to take over the universe.
Man, is she hot.
Mr. Saberhagen, your limo awaits.
And yes, you have to tip.
You should know, I plan to play the radio very loud.
Thanks for bringing me Juliette.
I'm in love.
They grow up so fast.
Sabrina, I'm glad I found you.
Sore Throat postponed.
Apparently, he has a sore throat.
- Dang, done in by irony.
- I gotta go.
He asked me to leave some lozenges in a brown paper bag on a bench in the park.
Hey, Dreama.
What are you doing here?
I joined a club, but it's only filled with parents and teachers.
Yeah, the PTA's funny that way.
Was Juliette excited about going to the reunion?
Oh, yeah, she said she can't wait to run into this guy that she had a huge crush on.
So she didn't go because she likes Salem?
- She likes that he's giving her a ride.
- Poor Salem.
So basically, the girl you picked for Salem is just using him.
That's one way to put it.
Why didn't you tell me Juliette was so awful?
- You met her.
- All right, let's not overreact.
Salem will survive.
He'll see the potato bar and all will be well.
Sure, he's thought he was in love before, and not just with himself.
- Hello?
- I'm calling from Other Realm Vegas about Mr. Saberhagen's wedding.
No!
Salem's gonna propose to Juliette.
No matter what food they serve, I think he's gonna be crushed.
Poor Salem.
He's gonna humiliate himself more than usual.
Well, we've got to stop him.
But if we don't get there in time, I think we should all blame Dreama.
- What's going on?
- Security.
- What's that ticking?
- Her.
Look, either you're strapped to some kind of explosive device, or you're just ticked off.
I can't let you through.
It's not like we're flying to Israel.
Well, you two go.
Salem can't wait.
I'm guessing a hijacking joke wouldn't be funny to you.
Wow, is that Becky Barnes?
She's lost a lot of weight.
That jerk.
He's not coming.
Oh, are you looking for the waiter?
I'll get him.
No, thanks.
If I need something, I'll make you get it.
I love your fire.
Juliette, there's something I've been dying to ask you.
I feel when life hands you something wonderful, you should grab it.
- You're not gonna touch me, are you?
- Okay, here it goes.
- Juliette, will you--?
- Salem, there you are.
Thought I might find you here.
We need to talk.
Let me start.
Go away.
Come on, Juliette.
You have cat litter on your back paws.
You know, white fur shows everything.
Sabrina, this night rocks.
We sipped champagne in the limo-- - There's something I need to tell you.
- We tangoed cheek to cheek.
This may be hard to say, but Cats can tango?
Wait a minute.
Salem, Juliette only came with you so she could see some other guy.
Her brother?
So if there was a question you were gonna pop, you might wanna save it for another girl.
I only have one question.
How could I be so stupid?
Salem, let me take you home.
- We could stop by the potato bar.
- Real bacon bits might help me forget.
Salem Saberhagen.
Yeah?
Billy Luto.
Well, look who's doing time in a kitty suit.
Did world domination plans fall through?
You want me to level the field and turn him into a mouse, a very slow mouse?
Thanks, but I can defend myself.
I'm not the high school nerd I used to be.
- Nice tux.
- Stop it.
So, what have I been up to?
Well, I'm rich, I'm married, and my bathroom is not in the kitchen.
I mean it.
Quit.
Boy, I haven't given a wedgie in decades.
I hope you're wearing little BVD's under that cummerbund.
Hey, leave him alone.
- Huh?
- At least Salem had real dreams.
Sure, they were bereft of ethics or even a real plan, but he had the guts to try.
This cat is more of a man than you'll ever be.
You're nothing but a big bully, Bully Luto.
Juliette.
Cute couple.
Maybe you'd like a wedgie built for two.
Okay, I'm done being brave.
Sabrina.
Look who's hanging by their heenie now.
Thank you, Juliette.
I knew you loved me.
Love you?
I don't love you.
I just can't stand him.
I liked him all junior year, nothing.
And unrequited love makes me cranky.
Come on, you like me just a little.
Now I wish I could roll my eyes.
Well, you like me better than him.
I like a canker sore better than him.
Yes.
Wow.
Apparently, these work in the Other Realm.
Thanks for meeting us here, Sore Throat.
- You wanna come closer?
SORE  No.
I'm a little nervous about this whole thing.
Well, don't be.
This is completely confidential.
Except for what we publish in the paper.
Yeah, so just relax and tell us everything you know.
- It's for the good of the school.
SORE  All right.
I keep seeing strange things.
This girl is wearing one outfit, and suddenly, she's wearing a different outfit.
Okay, well, I think we've got everything we need.
The same girl is on crutches, and the crutches disappear.
There's a talking cat.
And I can't take it anymore.
- Do you know what this means?
- Yep.
- No corroboration, no story.
- No, this is paranormal.
This is worthy of network TV.
This is bigger than meat.
Oh, pshaw, the kid's obviously starved for attention.
Aren't we all?
And besides, I've decided to go with another story.
"Kinkle Might Make First String".
Gotta go.
So how did it go?
Did Sore Throat cough it up?
He hocked something ugly up.
We gotta get out of here.
So you never pinned anything on Mr. Kraft, huh?
No.
I can't believe he wasn't dirty dealing.
No, now come on, you're being unreasonable.
We can work this out.
Oh, no, not the settee.
Where am I gonna take my naps?
- You told us it was t-bones.
- Yeah-- You never said it was school meat.
Because-- No.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh, this beautiful carol takes me back.
Mumsy would hum it while she baked gingerbread until she realised that the oven was set too high.
And then, the screaming would start.
Oh, I love Christmas.
Salem, I hate to throw a wet Yule log on your warm hearth of Christmas memories, but Zelda and I aren't getting you an 18-wheel big rig.
But it's all I asked for.
Face it, you're bad with gears.
Fine, I don't need your gifts, because this year, my true love is sending me the 12 Days of Christmas.
Who is your true love?
I ordered it from the Other Realm's online 89-Cents Store.
Oh, I love the 89-Cents Store, except for that exact change rule.
It's a beautiful way for me to tell me, "I love me".
Oh!
This endless cold snap is making me snap.
This is the worst time of year.
You're not anti-Christmas again, are you?
No.
I'm anti-windy, sub-freezing, post-apocalyptic weather.
I love Christmas.
Oh, Salem, it says here, your first 12-Days-of-Christmas present is about to arrive.
Danny Bonaduce?
This is the best Partridge in a pear tree I could ask for.
Happy holidays, everyone.
Cool, eggnog.
You got any ham?
Back in the tree, Bonaduce.
I've gotta get a better agent.
Okay, I am terrified of going outside.
If I see my breath one more time, I'm gonna smack it upside its head.
MAN : Now it's time for WWBG's Christmas Getaway Contest.
The first caller to answer this question correctly will win four tickets for a weeklong trip to tropical Jamaica, starting Christmas Day.
What, Jamaica?
Four tickets?
One, two, three, and a mortal?
We can bring Harvey.
Oh, wait.
We have to win it first.
The subject is science.
Oh, science, we won.
Aunt Zelda, just answer it.
Sabrina, I don't know everything about science.
You think you do.
Here's our question.
What parameter measures relative magnitude of viscous forces to Coriolis forces and the rotating flow of viscous, incompressible fluids?
Well, everyone and his donkey knows that.
- Ekman number.
- That's correct.
- I can't believe it, you won.
- We're going to Jamaica.
This man says we're going to Jamaica.
Oh, my gosh, Harvey and I are gonna have so much fun.
There's old-age stuff for you guys to do there too.
Sabrina, Zelda won the tickets.
She should pick the mortal of her choice.
I vote for Antonio Banderas.
Oh, please.
- Of course, Harvey can come.
- Thank you, Aunt Zelda.
You're the greatest aunt who ever lived.
Don't worry, second place is nothing to be ashamed of.
So, Harvey, you have any plans for Christmas?
Well, my mom's taking my little brother and the baby to visit Grandma.
So that means it will be just me, Dad and his patented "the working man never gets a break" speech.
Fantastic.
Well, I mean, I have a great surprise for you.
Just don't many any plans for a week starting Christmas day, okay?
I was gonna go to the Freddy Krueger marathon at the revival house.
No, don't buy tickets for that.
You hear me?
Don't make plans.
Do not make plans.
Okay, I won't make plans.
No, even planning not to make plans smacks of making plans.
Don't.
Oh, I have never seen the clock shop so busy.
My feet are killing me.
Ugh.
My cheeks are killing me.
From smiling at the customers.
Pretending to be polite is so exhausting.
Look at these two turtledoves.
They're just turtles with wings stapled on.
Since when did the 89-Cents Store start selling cheap and shoddy merchandise?
Maybe they really can fly.
- No, they'd have to be alive to do that.
- Eh?
Ready?
This almost makes me wish I wasn't Muslim.
Yeah, you'd miss the flatbread.
- Should we leave the tree naked?
- No, children might see it.
Hey.
Sabrina, tell your Aunt Zelda that Grammy is going to Vegas and she will not take me.
So now that Zelda is off to Jamaica, I'm spending another Christmas alone.
I'm sorry.
Oh, and you can add this.
Pbbt!
What was that?
Oh, my principal-slash- aunt's boyfriend.
And it's sort of my fault that he's gonna be alone-slash-sad on Christmas.
Yeah, see, I would have blamed the personality.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Aah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I ho-ho-hope you all enjoy the holidays.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're the three French hens I ordered.
Not what I had in mind at all.
Okay, I give up trying to keep pace with teen fashion.
It's for Jamaica.
Harvey and I are gonna frolic with the fishes.
Since we can't gamble.
We interrupt this programme to bring you a special weather bulletin.
Due to severe winter conditions, all airports on the eastern seaboard - have been closed indefinitely.
- No.
You can't do that.
You can't ruin mine and Harvey's vacation.
I know you're disappointed, but look on the bright side.
It will be a white Christmas.
That's pretty cool, huh?
And we'll all be together, that's the important thing.
Oh, you're talking crazy talk.
Great.
I've just been called crazy by someone in a rubber suit.
No two snowflakes are alike, my butt.
You're all united in your mission to ruin my Christmas.
You know, Mark Twain once said, "Gee, this moustache itches".
And he also said, "Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it".
Oh, so what you're saying is, I should use my magic to change the weather?
- What a great idea.
- Hmm.
So that I may be able to travel freely, send the snow away, I mean it, really.
The snow, it stopped.
It stopped.
Aah!
Looks like the spell went wrong in an unexpected way.
How unusual.
This look is not gonna work with my new bikini.
We're swamped and we're short-handed.
Why do they only loan prisoners out to clean highways?
Let's get some help from the Other Realm.
To help us cope with the Christmas rush, send us workers in a hurry, in other words, mush.
You two look like Santa's elves.
The uniforms always give us away.
I'm Powell, this is Pressburger.
It says here, you left Santa's workshop over creative differences.
- Please elaborate.
- I don't wanna slam Santa, but let me put it to you this way.
He doesn't have much of a sense of humour when it comes to fat jokes.
Not even the funny ones.
And that kiss between me and Mrs. Claus?
There was mistletoe all over the workshop.
Tell me about your years at Harvard.
Complete fabrication.
Thank goodness.
You're hired.
Christmas elves?
What a great promotional gimmick.
Hey, lady, Sensurround was a gimmick, we work here.
I'm feeling a little warm.
Turn the air conditioning up before I melt.
Hurry.
Okay, okay.
Boy, whenever the molecular structure of your body changes, you become really irritable.
I'm remembering a formula I learned in seventh-grade science.
Burning hot electrical bulb equals heat.
Don't worry, Sabrina.
I'll figure out a way to keep you cool until you can figure out a way to reverse the spell.
Figuring stuff out is not our strong suit, is it?
Hey, stop drinking that.
That's my unreconstituted right leg.
Sabrina, what happened?
What's with the puddle?
I had a little accident.
We can't reverse the spell.
The only way to plead your case is to go directly to Mother Nature.
Could we do it now?
In the words of another famous witch, "I'm melting".
Hello, Steve, Hurricane Steve?
Yeah, this is Mother Nature.
I need you to make a swing through the Virgin Islands later this week.
Don't give me any of that "I'm just a tropical storm" business.
Get off your tailwinds and get down there, pronto.
Mother Nature?
Um We're sorry to bother you.
She's Zelda Spellman, I'm Hilda Spellman.
- And this is our niece, Sabrina.
Hey.
Sorry for my appearance.
I'm a little pail right now.
Oh, I know you.
You're the selfish brat who changed the weather.
Yeah, but that's all water under the bridge.
In fact, I'm water under the bridge.
This spell always makes people talk in puns.
I hate that.
And you should know that the snow was stopping tonight, anyway.
Whoo-hoo.
I'm Jamaica-bound.
In a Thermos.
What Sabrina did was wrong, but she is a first-time offender.
Can't you please change her back?
Teenagers are enough of a handful without them clogging our drainage systems.
Oh, well, it's Christmas time, and I don't wanna be unseasonably mean.
So okay.
Ah.
Thanks.
I'm sure there's a town you need to reduce to rubble.
So we'd better get going.
Just a minute.
You're not getting off that easily.
I'm going to punch some data into my supercomputer, which will scientifically decide the most severe punishment for you.
Oh, no.
What terrible fate awaits me?
Not a tornado.
Oh, not hail.
Oh, no, not lightning.
You must spend time with a certain Willard Kraft and cheer him up.
No!
How about a little hail?
Be strong, honey, be strong.
Wear this Christmas-tree pin on your lapel.
When the star on the pin lights up like this, Mr. Kraft will be sufficiently cheered and your punishment will be over.
Great.
On top of everything else, I have to wear an ugly accessory.
I can't find Mr. Kraft anywhere, and I've called all his usual haunts.
His home, Custer's Steak House, Pat Buchanan for President headquarters.
Have you tried Westbridge High?
Oh, come on, being at school during Christmas vacation?
That's beyond pathetic, that's pathelog-- That's where he is.
It's the nine ladies dancing.
Nine of the largest, most ungraceful ladies you'll ever meet.
Knock it off.
Some of us are trying to sleep away the morning.
That's odd.
We're missing money from the cash register.
Well, I know you didn't take it, and I know I didn't take it, so who could it be?
We're going to the bank to make a deposit.
- We'll be back in 5.
- See you.
Who could it be?
Yes, I've found some kids that are qualified for suspension.
What are you doing here?
I just came by to see what your favourite Christmas food is.
Figgy pudding.
Go away.
That's so funny, because I was thinking about you, and I was thinking, "He looks like a figgy pudding kind of guy," so I baked you this.
- Do you think I'm a fool?
- Rhetorical question?
This was not baked with love, but just to curry favour with the man in power.
But guess what?
I'm going to eat all of it.
I've got it.
Powell and Pressburger stole our money.
Hilda, you always suspect the worst in people.
Come on, have some faith in your fellow man.
But just in case the little hooligans snatched the dough, let's watch the surveillance camera.
Even when you hire people you don't know on the spur of the moment, it can still backfire on you.
Oh, it makes me so mad.
Hilda, this is the Christmas season.
We must have compassion.
ZELDA : Powell, Pressburger, straighten up the backroom, okay?
Sure thing.
Straighten up the backroom, okay?
Those felonious little rogue elves.
Oh, come on, lighten up.
Look at me, I'm Hilda.
I own a clock shop.
I pay minimum wage.
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, they're sled-kill.
Twelve drummers drumming, eleven pipers piping.
One cat crumbling.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
- That was good, huh?
- Yes, it was.
And you're feeling cheerful now, huh?
I can feel the sugar surging through my body, giving me comfort.
- You can?
- Yes.
And I can feel that now my sugar rush is officially over.
Oh, no, we're getting further away from the land of cheerful.
I don't really care for this time of year.
Oh, I'm never gonna get to Jamaica.
Oh, okay, let's snap out of it.
- Who wants to go for a walk?
- Not me.
- Great, let's go.
- No.
I just want to remind you two, that Christmas isn't just about getting stuff.
Or say, money.
It's also about honesty and overcoming your bad impulses.
That's a good point.
In fact, we've gone out of our way not to get drunk during business hours.
Oh, we're at Zoo-zoo's store.
Hi, Monkey.
- Hi.
- I need to speak with you alone.
I can't hear.
I have tried everything.
I was pushing him at the park on the swings just now, and not even so much as a "whee".
You've gotta help me.
Honey, I'd drop everything in a second to help my Willard, but according to Mother Nature, I'm not allowed to.
It's your punishment to cheer him up.
Oh, I can hear again.
Yeah, how's that for cheerful good news?
Is this thing on?
Mr. Kraft, why are you so miserable at Christmastime?
Because I've never had a good one.
At least, none that I can remember.
Maybe I can help.
- This area is for employees only.
- What's wrong with me?
Did I just say what's wrong with me?
Because I couldn't hear it.
I'm gonna take Mr. Kraft back through the grandfather time clock so that he can remember a good Christmas, and I can go to Jamaica.
All right, well, if you leave him back there, I didn't see you.
Mr. Kraft, this grandfather clock will cheer you up.
Thank goodness I can hear again.
There's nothing worse than losing your hearing.
You see that sad, lost, - lonely-looking boy over there?
- The one with the coal?
I'm the even more pathetic kid next to him.
If you think this is bad, you should see me a few years from now at the orphanage.
Oh, no, not an orphanage.
Mr. Kraft, which one are you?
That's me, on the outside as usual.
I didn't have it good like those orphans.
Oh, how I envied them.
Didn't you have one happy Christmas in your whole life?
Merry Christmas, Willard.
A sled?
Oh, boy.
I wish I'd gotten this before we moved to Miami.
But I don't care.
This is great.
Willard, you're scratching the pavement.
That was a good Christmas.
- Whoo-hoo!
I'm going to Jamaica.
- What's that?
Um  And they lived happily ever after.
Who did?
Oh, Mr. Kraft, did you go deaf again?
You know, you had that glazed look on your face during my whole story, like you were in some reflective, revealing daydream.
It was the most powerful daydream of my life.
And you know what, Sabrina, I think I've figured out the secret to a happy Christmas.
- Really?
What is it?
- Low expectations.
As long as you look at Christmas as just one other day in the long, endless drudgery that is life, then you won't be disappointed when joy doesn't come.
Well, I'm glad I could cheer you up.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
- Ugh!
- Hilda, there doesn't seem to be any money missing.
Let's check the security camera just to be sure.
That Zelda woman was right.
It was wrong to take their money.
Oh, those little dears.
They put the money back.
You see, I knew if I just lectured them, it would do them some good.
Wait, do you see the lady who just came in the store?
Is she shoplifting?
No, no.
I think she's looking.
Oh, well.
Thank goodness for surveillance cameras.
Yeah.
They were on to us about the money, but they'll never miss a clock.
I love this time of year.
Come in.
Hey.
Merry Christmas Eve.
Oh, back at you.
Oh.
Here's your present.
Harvey, a diamond bracelet.
Actually, it's "I can't believe it's not diamonds".
Twice as shiny, but at a fraction of the cost.
Well, I love it.
It will look great with my "almost onyx" necklace you gave me.
Tickets?
Oh, passes to the Freddy Krueger marathon at the revival house.
- I won't sleep for a week.
Thanks.
- Heh-heh.
Speaking of nightmares, do you wanna try the Christmas cookies I made?
You bet.
I coated my stomach before I came over.
Movie tickets?
Then who did she give the extra ticket to?
Oh, no.
Zelda Spellman, you foxy Santa Claus.
A trip to Jamaica.
I have never had such an incredible present.
Well, you know what a scamp I am.
Oh, excuse me, Zellie, don't we need to speak to Sabrina alone?
Be right back.
Sabrina.
Oh.
You gave Willard Kraft the extra ticket?
- And credited it to me?
- Mr. Kraft is the bane of my existence, but for some reason, I feel he should have at least one happy Christmas.
I don't know what got into me.
- It's called the Christmas spirit.
- It's called insanity.
Ah.
I can hear again.
I didn't expect headphone-related hearing loss until my 40's.
Well, I guess we're Jamaica-bound.
Ugh.
What ever happened to the whole global-warming thing?
Cheer up.
I complained to the 89-Cents Store and they sent me a baker's dozen of doughnuts.
Thirteen crullers calling.
Oh, yeah.
- It's official.
All airports closed.
- Tsk.
Well, at least we all get to stay here and have a white Christmas.
That's the spirit.
And you know what, if we can't go to Jamaica, then  We'll bring Jamaica here.
Yeah, mon.
Wow.
This is way better than a fruitcake.
Harvey.
Even though 10,000 people are without electricity, I'm happy you're snowed in.
- I get to spend Christmas with you.
- Ha-ha.
Well, let's grab a refreshment, and groove to the reggae, mon.
Anybody wanna buy a pair of slightly-used Bermudas?
I really see this, right?
This is not another daydream?
I'm sorry about the snow, Monkey.
I know how much you wanted to go to Jamaica.
I do not care.
I am not alone on Christmas.
Let's boogie.
It was a show.
Get over it.
There was no real Reuben Kincaid.
Powell.
Pressburger.
Oh, what a lovely gesture, but we actually have a lot of clocks.
Not as many as you think.
We stole this, but we're sorry.
Well, the important thing is, you righted a wrong.
And we heard you had jerk chicken.
I don't mean to pick on your elves, but aren't you mixing themes?
What a great Christmas.
But it's strange how it started snowing.
Mother Nature said it was supposed to warm up.
Well Wait a minute, where's Hilda?
- Aunt Hilda?
- Yes, I admit it.
I'm selfish, but there was no way I was going to Jamaica with Willard Kraft.
Happy holidays, everybody.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Oh!
Good, you're here.
I know things have been a slow lately, but I have made a decision that is going to change our business in a profound way.
You're getting out of clocks and into something that makes sense.
I got it.
Designer cat food.
No, and fat chance, tubby.
I have something in the storeroom that is going to have a line of customers snaking around the block.
Ta-da.
Well, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say, "Creepy".
Well, they'll certainly be a nice deduction come tax time.
All right, I'll give you one more chance.
Salem, what do you think?
Let me be delicate.
Those clocks are awful.
Is that so?
I mean, awful good.
Look over there.
No, over there.
No, over there.
Oh-ho.
Change me back or take me to Wimbledon.
So are you buying a dress for the Snowflake Ball?
No, I've got plenty that are fine for loitering around the punch bowl.
That's all Harvey and I do at those things.
MAN : Attention, please.
The finalists for the king and queen of the Snowflake Ball are: Gracie Charters and Dan Kael, Jean Huang and Hans Tercek, and Sabrina Spellman and Harvey Kinkle.
You know, I've won lots of academic prizes, but never anything as meaningless as a popularity contest.
Think Harvey and I have a shot?
Well, they say the cutest couple always wins.
But those girls are really cute.
You and Harvey are cute too.
Right, we'll just be ourselves and let the chips fall where they may.
And I'll just take the high road.
But while I'm taking it, I may as well do it in a killer new dress.
Zelda, I've got bad news.
Uh-oh.
Is Salem running five minutes fast again?
No, I just found out that one of those gigantic Everything Emporium stores is going to open outside of town.
Oh, one of those great discount places?
They have a huge selection of clothing and appliances and clocks.
And I really love this place.
I was hoping to struggle for a few years and then file for chapter 11.
Then don't overreact.
It's probably just a rumour.
Do you wanna start boarding up the windows or should I?
Josh, think I'd look good in this dress?
You can't see the outline of my liver, though.
Why do women do this to themselves?
Sabrina, you're smart, you're beautiful.
What does this girl have that you don't?
You mean, besides millions of dollars and an abusive rock star boyfriend?
That's what's wrong with our society.
See, we emphasise beauty to such a degree, it's downright unhealthy.
Hey, look, a pill to stop hair loss.
Hey, Salem, wanna see the dress that's gonna get me elected queen of the Snowflake Ball?
Put it on.
But I should warn you, I can be catty.
It's the only one they had.
Isn't it perfect?
Except for the fact that it's one size too small.
I see, in your world, "perfect" means "doesn't fit".
And since it's an Other Realm original, - it can't be altered.
- Really?
Now I know why the Other Realm trails behind Paris as the fashion capital.
Okay, well, if I can't alter the dress, I'll alter myself.
I'll diet.
I've never done it.
But how hard can it be?
Yeah.
The fact that weight loss products comprise a billion-dollar industry is probably just a funny coincidence.
Good morning.
How would you like your eggs?
Oh, as far away from me as possible.
I'm on a diet so I can fit in my new dress and be elected queen of the Snowflake Ball.
Oh, and if you can go down two dress sizes, you can get into an Ivy League school.
- You're fine just the way you are.
- Fine?
Harvey and I are competing with two other really cute couples.
Fine is gonna come in third.
At least let me give you one of these whole grain muffins.
Oh, come on, think of chewing as an aerobic exercise.
Ugh.
Just holding this muffin is making me feel bloated.
Huh?
Mm One man's trash, baby.
One, two, three, four.
Their prices are low, but their morals are lower.
Well, once again, you're overreacting.
Overreacting gets results.
I am simply exercising my right to free speech.
Uh-huh.
And the rotten fruit?
Visual aids.
Hilda, I've made an appointment for you with the president of the Everything Emporium to sit down and discuss the matter, if you'd like to try the mature approach.
Fine.
I just hope I can return that cow manure.
What are the odds the cafeteria would have cheeseburgers and chocolate sundaes on the same day?
I know, it's like winning the lottery.
Did you misplace your entrÃ©e?
No, I'm trying to lose weight so I can fit in my new dress.
The dress that's gonna make us a lock for king and queen.
- Good, so we're both doing our part.
- What's yours, eating like Henry VIII?
Don't pretend like you haven't noticed my moustache.
Oh, I see it.
No, that's just a shadow.
Does anyone else hear that strange buzzing sound?
Yes, like the low hum of an incoming B-52.
Are we at war?
Oh, I think it's that darn sophomore with the deviated septum.
He must have closed his mouth again.
Sabrina, could you come up here?
I think I might have an antacid.
What flavour?
Can I have two?
I always carry the essentials.
Let's see.
No, that one's for leprosy.
So thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me.
Hand me that towel, will you?
What?
- Fire him.
- Your son?
He's not a closer.
Anyway, I hoped if I could tell you what a wonderful place my shop is, you would find it in your heart to spare it.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a good one.
Ha.
Spare it.
Who sent you in here, huh?
Artie?
You're serious, aren't you?
You really think there's anything you could tell me to keep me from squashing you like a bug?
We put a lot of effort into our selection of timepieces.
Oh, well, in that case, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna count all the way to three before I call security.
Before I go, could I just make one little point?
Oh, look who's been downsized.
This stinks.
I've been dieting for half a day and I haven't even lost a pound.
I have found that the key to losing weight is eating the right foods.
Who are you channelling?
I saw you put sugar on bacon.
Lean bacon.
There's gotta be something here that will help me fit in my dress.
Hey, look at this ad.
"Thanks to Blubber-B-Gone, I lost 50 pounds in three days".
That's ridiculous.
- What'd he do?
Lop off a leg.
- Here goes.
Thin my thighs, lose my roll, Make me skinnier than Manute Bol Whoa, I see you called me in the nick of time.
I did?
Losing weight the Blubber-B-Gone way is easy.
Whenever you're hungry, instead of eating food, just mix yourself a shake.
Taste.
Not bad, although I still prefer ipecac.
Excuse me, but I think we've met before.
Weren't you selling that "Turn Your Eye Gunk Into Gold" kit a few years ago?
No, that must have been my brother.
Happy dieting.
This is great, I'm gonna lose weight, I'm gonna look fantastic in my new special dress, and I'll be elected queen of the ball.
Right, and one of these days my pink eye is gonna pay off big.
Oh, no, woman's pump at 10:00.
Oh.
So how does it feel being the little guy?
What's that?
Earthquake?
Mm, mm, mm!
Blech.
And now, for the moment of truth.
It fits.
The shakes worked.
Hi there, I thought you might like to try our new flavours.
Gaunt Grape and Lean, Mean Nectarine.
Thanks, but I lost all the weight I had to.
I don't need any more shakes.
You really think so?
You guys must work on commission, as you can plainly see I-- Look awful.
I'll take two cases.
Quick, before firemen have to come and cut me out of my bedroom.
By the way, how did your meeting go with the president of Everything Emporium?
Not bad.
At first, it wasn't going well, but then he had a metamorphosis.
Either you're up to something or-- No, that's it, you're up to something.
Mm.
Sabrina, you've got to try these croissants.
Just like grandma used to make.
Well, not my grandma, but someone's who knew how to bake.
No, thanks, I had a raisin earlier and, boy, am I stuffed.
You're looking awfully skinny.
You're not still on that diet, are you?
Me?
No, I'm fine.
- Hey, do I see a little scalp up there?
- Ahh.
Don't tell me.
I've inherited the Spellman gene for a keister the size of Manhattan.
Oh.
I knew it.
It was just some sort of spell.
And yet the insecurity about my butt won't go away.
I think it's time to bring back suspenders.
Sabrina, we have to talk.
Well, I only have a little while before Harvey picks me up, and your stern lectures tend to eat up the clock.
Not only are these things a scam, - but they cause serious side effects.
- But I have to lose weight.
Like making you think you have to lose weight.
Come here, look in the mirror.
No, not the mirror.
- It's so cruel and unforgiving.
- Not anymore.
That creepy salesman put a spell on it, but I deactivated it, see?
What are you talking about?
It's like looking at a picture of William Howard Taft.
Oh, no.
All this dieting has affected you psychologically.
You can't see you're so thin, you're practically sick.
What good is my health if I'm not queen?
No more shakes.
Fine, force me to live with this obscene obesity.
You know, Aunt Zelda's so unfair.
I know it seems unfair now, but someday, when you're older and wiser, you'll be able to look back on all this and get revenge.
Hey, one more shake wouldn't hurt.
And it would be wrong to waste perfectly good guar gum.
Hilda, here's an interesting news item.
"Everything Emporium president missing".
Oh, look, Larry King likes the new Ludlum novel.
Did you have anything to do with this?
No, Robert Ludlum has his own publicist.
Oh, you mean the Everything Emporium president.
Yes, he was bugging me, so I turned him into one.
- Ginger beer?
- A bug?
Hilda, you've got to change him back.
He is in a perfectly humane situation.
Now that I gave him air holes.
I wonder if that last milkshake made any difference?
I certainly feel lighter.
Salem, help.
I've disappeared.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, twirl me around so it looks like I'm flying.
What's happened?
Where am I?
You've dieted until you've disappeared.
Now, I'm starting to wonder if you can be too rich.
There has to be a potion in here somewhere.
You need an Other Realm camera.
Everyone knows those cameras add a hundred pounds.
That's Harvey.
Order me a camera.
Now.
Come on, Sabrina.
We're not gonna be able to vote for ourselves if we're late.
A self-opening door?
Cool.
Not very safe, but cool.
Has the camera arrived yet?
- Yes.
Finally.
Hurry up and take my picture.
Could we take another one?
I think your eyes were closed.
Sabrina, I'm down here when you're ready.
- And sorry to anyone I woke up.
I'll be right there.
Okay, everything is gonna be fine.
Uh-oh.
You think that happened because we didn't use name brand film?
Look, it says the camera only brings you back for a few minutes.
So much for "take a picture, it'll last longer".
And you'll start to flicker whenever you're about to disappear.
- Like that.
Quick, take another picture.
Okay, this time I'm gonna get a little more creative.
- You got a wind machine handy?
- Just shoot me.
Oh, oh.
Great, I'm gonna have to take the camera and keep having my picture taken.
But don't let anyone else in the picture.
If people aren't flickering out, they'll gain a hundred pounds.
And to think, I used to complain when I got a run in my stocking.
I keep him in a little glass jar, which I refer to as Oz.
- Uh-oh.
Jailbreak.
- You lost him?
Oh, perfect.
Thanks to your overreacting, I get to spend my Friday night looking for a cockroach with my sister.
Come on, this is the stuff that keeps us young.
Oh, I think I see a dropping.
- You look terrific.
- Do you think so?
This is more a standing-up dress than sitting-down dress.
Thought we'd be standing.
Too bad your car doesn't have a sunroof.
You look terrific.
So, what's up with the camera?
Oh, you know, I wanted to preserve the memories of our big night.
Did you drop your left cufflink?
What was that?
Northern lights?
Sabrina, that dress is fantastic.
Really?
You don't think it makes me look hippy?
My eyes are acting weird.
Oh, I saw something about that on 2 0/2 0.
The best thing is to keep them closed.
- Hey, would you take my picture?
- Sure.
- Smile.
- Oh, no, Harvey.
Sorry.
Your eyes always come out red.
Oh.
Got him.
No, that's a real roach.
Wait a minute.
I know exactly what we need.
A roach motel?
Zelda, this guy is a captain of industry.
There's no way he'd stay at a motel.
Okay, fine.
The Roach-Carlton.
Nice, except for the faint smell of boric acid, I'd give it four stars.
I've never seen a camera like this before.
Just push the button, Avedon.
- A picture.
- Mrs. Quick, no.
We gotta get you out of here.
Now, don't get too upset, okay?
There's gotta be a simple explanation.
It's a bee sting, isn't it?
Okay.
I thought I heard buzzing earlier, but I attributed it to my tinnitus.
MAN : The next dance is for our king and queen nominees, and then it's time for everyone to vote.
Mrs. Quick, don't panic, okay?
We're gonna rush you to the hospital.
Everything will be fine.
I just need one minute.
Got him.
I knew he couldn't resist that thumbnail-sized Toblerone.
Thank goodness.
Zap him back so we can to home.
Right.
- But first a little good-natured torture.
- Hilda?
Where am I?
Um We found you wandering out in the street.
I think you may have hit your head.
Do you feel all right?
Do you perhaps feel like you now understand what it's like to be the little guy?
In constant fear of unfeeling giants?
No, I feel strong.
In fact, I feel like I could withstand a nuclear holocaust.
I suppose this means you're going to go ahead and build your Everything Emporium now.
What?
I'm gonna climb Mount Everest, bike across Death Valley, I'm gonna eat my weight in garbage.
Why would I wanna waste my indestructibleness on business?
See?
I told you overreacting would work.
Harvey, stop fidgeting.
Try and look like we're having a good time.
I feel like all we're being judged on is how we look.
- How do I look?
- Gorgeous.
- Will you stop asking me that?
- Stop yelling at me.
Nobody's gonna vote for us if it looks like we're fighting.
But do I really look okay?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's just dance.
Gotta go.
Dreama, have you seen my camera?
- No, but you can use mine.
Look for it, please.
Something tells me this is about more than a camera.
- Thank you for helping me back here.
- My pleasure.
I was feeling a little disoriented.
Ooh.
I wonder if I could scurry up those curtains.
Come on, Hilda, let's go.
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.
I'm beginning to think you have a problem.
And now, the moment everyone's been waiting for, the king and queen of this year's Snowflake Ball are: Harvey Kinkle and Sabrina Spellman.
Sabrina?
And I thought dancing alone was embarrassing.
I can't believe she's missing this.
Hello.
Ahem.
I'm grateful for the honour and all, but since Sabrina's disappeared, maybe you guys should pick somebody else.
No.
- Sabrina?
Oh.
My foot.
Sorry.
Dreama, do me a favour.
Go on stage and stall them until I can find the camera, would you?
Okay, but only because people are starting to think I'm talking to myself.
Here I am in my moment of glory, and no one can see me.
Too bad I'm not a bigger fan of irony.
She's really level-headed, and pretty down-to-earth.
Is that girl talking about me?
Yeah, I voted for Sabrina too.
I mean, she's nice and she definitely doesn't follow the pack.
Great, I dieted until I became invisible and spent a load of money on a dress and they voted for me because I don't normally do that.
I'm back.
All I needed to restore myself was a little self-esteem.
And I definitely don't need to diet.
In fact, if I don't eat something, I'm gonna keel over.
Mrs. Quick.
Sorry about your dress.
Oh, that's okay.
If you don't mind, I think I'll keep this for the next time I swell up.
It happens fairly often.
Good news is, we didn't have to go to the emergency room.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
Although part of me was looking forward to all the excitement.
And now my personal favourite, Mr. Bunny Rabbit.
Hey, where have you been?
Awash in social pressure, but I'm back.
And I've got something to say.
Well, don't tell the story about the two priests on the golf course - because Dreama already did that.
- It got a laugh.
I wanna say that I learned an important lesson tonight.
I realise that what a person looks like on the outside doesn't matter as much as what she's like inside.
I think this belongs to Sabrina.
Or Allan Carr.
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for hygiene and grooming, but thanks to you, I'll be keeping it in perspective.
This is a moment she'll never want to forget.
Say, cheese.
Mrs. Quick, no.
So there we were, receiving our crowns, when suddenly Sabrina ballooned out.
She was huge.
At this time, we think a rogue bee may have been the culprit.
Wow.
I hope she wasn't planning to wear it to the prom.
Well, I'm sure Sabrina will be fine.
Thanks for bringing her home.
Is the coast clear?
Ugh.
I have learned my lesson.
I am never starving myself again.
Honey, just remember, if you just eat right and get regular exercise, you'll never have a problem.
Mm.
It's always worked for me.
Are there any more apple delights?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
A peanut butter, banana and vitamin sandwich?
- I'm intrigued.
- It's career day at school.
I have to figure out what I'm gonna do.
So hopefully, a diet rich in Jif and zinc will help.
If you'd like to get a head start, I have a witch aptitude test on my laptop.
- Is it accurate?
- Are you kidding?
Not only did it peg me 100 percent, but I got into Wellesley.
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Put your finger on the asterisk key and it'll show you your future.
Don't you quit on me.
I need 4 milligrams of epi, stat.
And something for my tummy.
Okay, either I'm gonna spend my future being sued for malpractice, or that test is wrong.
Salem, did you tamper with this test?
Took, tampered with.
A cat's gotta do what a cat's gotta do.
Tell Elton John he can start singing now.
You know what I hate about career day?
It makes you think about your future.
I don't know.
Some of these lectures are pretty nap-friendly.
Spellman, Kinkle, new girl.
I'm not new.
I've been here all year.
Surly new girl.
Detention.
That's it?
No calling us miscreants?
No resenting us for our youth?
Why bother?
Oh, sure, when I became principal, I had a dream.
Mandatory "Yes, sirs," corporal punishment, scratchy woollen shorts.
But my hands are tied by the school board.
And the century.
Yeah, when you look in the mirror and the man staring back is just an ineffectual figurehead, crushing young dreams just ain't what it used to be.
That's kind of sad.
He used to really revel in being unjustly mean.
Hey, wanna check out the World Needs Corn booth?
Can't.
I have an appointment to talk to a career counsellor.
He's gonna help me whittle my options down from anything but a doctor.
It's good that you're thinking about your future.
You are clearly at a crucial crossroad.
Mm-hm.
Well, thank you for offering me that shred of hope.
- Here's the literature you requested.
- Thank you.
Although I have to tell you that rodeo clowning might be rough on a man your age.
Duly noted.
- Mr. Kraft wants to change careers?
- Yes.
So Mr. Kraft is soon to be ex-principal of my little hallways.
Explains why you're floating on air.
But you better get down.
Your Aunt Eileen lost an eye that way.
I just hope Mr. Kraft doesn't try and move in here.
Nothing sadder than a man who freeloads off a woman.
Yeah, may I remind you that I'm a cat?
- Should we tell Zelda?
- No.
She'll use her common sense to talk him into staying and playing it safe.
I just got off the phone with Willard.
He's having an identity crisis.
He's not sure if he's actually human?
No.
He wants to change jobs.
- And you talked him out of it.
- Of course not.
You are so good for him.
I encouraged Willard to take a leave of absence and go find a job that will make him happy.
Yes, and you might wanna mention that Mexico is brimming with opportunities.
I hope he takes your advice.
But I doubt Willard Kraft would leave a job where he gets free pens.
KRAFT : And so, with a heavy heart, I resign as principal of Westbridge High.
I prayed for this day.
Well, I'm sure those kids were just punchy.
Well, maybe I'm being paranoid, because the bacchanal happened immediately after the announcement.
Well, you were right to keep those pens.
But how am I gonna pick a new career?
I just fell into academics.
Well, after I failed the post office exam.
You just need to try new things.
I'm scared, Zoo-Zoo.
I mean, what if people scowl at me and say mean things?
You've dealt with that wonderfully for years.
Willard Kraft, you are a brilliant and talented man.
I want you to follow your dreams.
I'll do it.
Ooh!
But just think of all the jobs you know you don't want now.
I gotta tell you, I am seriously thinking of taking my job back at the school.
You can't.
I mean, you just have to stick to it till you find a job that's suited for you.
I tried.
I've got the scabs to prove it.
So it might take a while.
I mean, look at me.
I found my dream job at the coffeehouse.
Sabrina, say hello to your new shift partner, Will.
As in, "I've lost the will to live"?
No, just Will.
Now that I'm behind Gen-X enemy lines, I thought I'd go with something a little more with it.
You've gotta help me get Mr. Kraft out.
A coffeehouse should be a sanctuary.
Amen.
Don't worry, we'll figure something out.
We can't tell Aunt Zelda.
She'd never want me to interfere with Kraft's life.
You've got to help me get Willard out of that coffeehouse.
We do?
I mean, absolutely.
What is an intelligent, talented man doing wasting his time in some pathetic little hole-in-the-wall?
Hey.
I mean, absolutely.
He just needs to remember his childhood dreams.
You know what?
I am going out and get him a copy of What Colour is Your Parachute?
Oh, what a sweet idea.
It will never work.
You'd better use magic.
All Willard needs is a shot of Dream Come True.
Sounds very Golden Age of Hollywood.
All you have to do is squirt him and he'll become what he wanted to be.
He'll have to quit the coffeehouse, and we'll go back to having customers.
Let's test it out.
I'm not scratching the furniture.
Finally, I'm a guy in red suspenders.
Get in line, ladies.
Beautiful.
Well, I'll thank you later.
First I have to shoot Will before he gets something pierced.
Two cappuccinos.
- Mr. Kraft?
- You left your job for this?
Oh, yeah.
That gig was strictly L-seven.
Hey, you two peepsters savvy to any raves this weekend?
I'll just get those cappuccinos.
This is like a mercy killing.
Wow, Sabrina.
He wasn't bothering us that much.
Oh, this is all part of the training.
Police that slop tray.
Now, mister.
Ah!
Ooh.
I have someplace very important to go.
Just call me The Little Kraft Who Could.
And just call me the dream weaver.
- Think fast.
- Brad, don't.
No.
You got me.
It was my last day on the force.
Harvey, Harvey, speak to me.
I think he's gonna survive.
What do you think this is, some kind of toy?
Hey, that guy's stealing the tip jar.
Citizens, go about your business.
Mighty Teen to the rescue.
- I believe this is yours.
- Aah!
And I believe that's frightened criminal for "I'm sorry".
Mighty Teen, away.
- Was that Kinkle?
- Was he flying?
Yeah.
That was Harvey flying.
He's trying to get away from Bigfoot and Elvis.
Heh.
No more caffeine for you two.
There's gotta be a way to reverse this Dream Come True spell.
Here, "Once someone lives out their childhood dream, the spell will automatically end".
Great.
Well, Harvey obviously wanted to be a superhero.
Now that he saved the day, he fulfilled his childhood dream.
I bet he's back to normal already.
- I gotta get curtains.
- You gotta reverse that spell.
Excuse me, but your cat was stuck up a tree.
I got a real kick out of his little fireman suit.
Oh.
You're brave, virile, and easily entertained.
Come back next week.
He's going to be Abe Lincoln.
Yeah, I'd better go.
The guys are gonna get together, watch the fight, eat chilli.
Just the guys hanging around in our skivvies, loading up on the musical fruit, and watching the sweet science, and I'm not there?
I gotta convince them I'm a real fireman.
Try losing the tail.
Oh, if you're thinking of trying that matchmaking service, take it from me, specify "mammal".
I just read an e-mail from Willard.
He sounds so happy.
He says he's going to follow his dream.
Really?
Whatever could have gotten onto--?
I mean, into him.
I wonder what his dream is.
You know, is it a doctor, or statesman, or--?
- This.
- Request clearance for sugar.
Oh, look, it's Baron Von Emergency Landing.
You know, they all laughed at Lindbergh too.
But that will change when I realise my lifelong dream of recreating his flight across the Atlantic in a tiny two-seater.
It certainly is a strange, some might even say delusional dream.
But good for you.
You have to admit, I look awfully dashing in goggles.
Heh-heh.
What's with the glasses?
Oh, I've had these for a while.
I mainly use them for sleeping.
Harvey, I know your childhood dream was to be Mighty Teen.
I've never met the lad, but I hear he's a nice fellow.
I need to know, what mission does he have to fulfil or motto does he have to live up to?
Mighty Teen was put on this Earth to save the world.
- The whole world?
- Or so I've been told.
These bathrooms are nothing but trouble.
They always run out of toilet paper.
Trouble?
Excuse me, I just remembered I left my notebook in this classroom.
Where there's trouble around, Mighty Teen will be found.
- Oh, super.
- Not Super Teen, Mighty Teen.
Kinkle, what are you doing?
This is one great senior prank, huh?
And yet, there's nothing funny about poor hygiene, ma'am.
Mighty Teen, away.
I have to admit, he really pulls off that cape.
Do you think bringing economy-size toilet paper to a bathroom would fulfil Mighty Teen's quest to?
I'm gonna stop talking now.
Well, what do you think?
I wanted it to be just like Lindbergh's.
Wow.
It looks nothing like Lindbergh's.
And yet, even though you used modern materials, you managed to make it so much less safe.
Guess what I named her after.
Oh, Willard, you didn't.
- Oh.
You didn't.
- Yep, the Spirit of Westbridge.
See, I want my flight to be just like Lindy's.
Right down to only taking one bologna sandwich, and a tiny bottle of water, and a lawn chair to sit in.
Dear, I think it's wonderful that you have your lunch meat and your terribly rickety chair, but what about the small matter of flying experience?
Oh, well, if I get into trouble, I'll just fly square circles until I can latch on to the proper longitude.
My, my, you seem to have acquired a great deal of aviation knowledge very suddenly.
Almost magically.
Excuse me, I have to go see my sister and make some accusations.
Somewhere, there has to be a story where Mighty Teen saves the world.
We have to recreate it and Harvey will go back to normal.
Here's one where Mighty Teen squeezes his radioactive zit on his arch-nemesis.
Okay, gross and keep looking.
The good thing about having changed Harvey is he'll never feel pain or die.
You obviously didn't read issue number 64, where he died painfully.
Sorry.
Okay, more good news.
What is that?
This is Red Eagle to squad leader, we are in progress.
Do you smell smoke?
Nothing to worry about, folks.
Keep it moving and let the fireman do his job.
I hate to interfere with the pro, so I have no problem doing this.
But I wanted to fight the fire and prevent our home from incinerating.
- Who started this fire, anyway?
- Me.
Hilda, did you put some sort of spell on Willard?
I can honestly tell you that yes, there is a spell on him.
And I can honestly tell you that no, I didn't do it.
It would have been a lot easier just to say, "Sabrina did it," Aunt Snitch.
Sabrina, you are in serious trouble.
Where there's trouble around, Mighty Teen will be found.
Obviously, one of Mighty Teen's powers is eavesdropping.
Let the girl go, oh, dark one.
I'm her aunt.
It's okay.
I did something wrong and my aunt was upset with me.
A false alarm.
Much like the conundrum I faced in issue number 15, "Requiem for a Mutant".
Mighty Teen, away.
Criminals, beware.
You've warned them.
Isn't that enough?
That was odd.
But Harvey's strange behaviour couldn't have anything to do with Willard's.
I mean, there is no spell that would make Willard wanna fly across the ocean, and turn Harvey into a superhero.
Uh-huh.
Dream Come True.
Or whatever you call that thing you made.
I knew it.
You put a Childhood Dream spell on Willard.
You said you wanted him to follow his dreams.
He's flying to Paris in a hunk of balsa wood.
Oh, that thing will never get off the ground.
See you in 33-and-a-half hours.
He seemed happy.
Zellie, just a thought, but maybe you should go along with Willard so that he doesn't die.
I can't.
Since Sabrina put the spell on him, only she can protect him.
But I have to protect Harvey.
Who knows what evil he's chosen to fight?
I mean, some criminals can be downright mean.
Sabrina, we are in triage.
My boyfriend's situation is worse right now.
And he doesn't have super powers.
All right, I'll go.
But if you hear the screams of Mighty Teen, will you call the Justice League of America?
Boy, this spell has really gotten out of control.
Bad Sabrina.
I'm free.
Away from the world, with it's mundane little annoyances.
- Hey.
- Aah!
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm not really here.
I'm a phantom, just like Lindbergh hallucinated after 20 hours of flying.
I've only been flying a few minutes.
Well, it's a much more fast-paced world.
Look at MTV.
What's that noise that sounds like an engine failing?
That would be your engine failing.
Usually, a sure sign that we're going down.
Tempting, but That's it, baby.
Yes, I knew you wouldn't let me down.
I hope you're in the mood for burritos, because Paris, France, here we come.
E-six.
Stop trying to sink my battleship.
I'm trying to trace Willard and Sabrina's flight over the Atlantic.
Well, I just wanna tell you about me fulfilling my childhood dream.
- Later.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
There I was, cut off from my squadron, and Lady Fahrenheit was cranking up the jet.
With nothing more than my wits to arm me, I saved countless lives by subduing a raging brush fire.
This is coming out of your allowance, you little pyro.
You know, I don't think a daredevil like Lindy would settle for a straight line.
Let's make this interesting.
Stop.
Where's your sense of adventure?
In my throat along with my stomach.
- Ow!
- Whoa!
That was fun.
I can't straighten my finger out.
Yeah, but why would you need to?
Just leave the driving to us.
Come fly with me Let's float, let's-- Oh, sweet mother of mercy, we're out of gas.
Oh, no, my magic's out.
I knew I shouldn't have used the dials off of mother's stove.
Oh, no, it must be because I jammed my finger.
Look, will you shut up about your finger?
I don't understand this.
I filled this plane with the exact same amount of gas that Lindy did.
Lindbergh didn't waste his gas over the Carnival Cruise ship trying to get a glimpse of Kathie Lee.
I just can't wait and worry.
Oh, don't be such a worry witch.
Sabrina and Willard are gonna be fine.
And if anything goes wrong, Sabrina has her magic.
I guess this is it.
- No.
No, no, this is it.
Mr. Kraft, this is my last chance to tell you how I feel about you.
There's something I wanna share with you too.
Me first.
You're an idiot.
You didn't even buy enough gas.
Now we're going down, you shovel head.
Well, you give dead weight a bad name, you whiney little stowaway.
This is taking an awfully long time.
And it hasn't even hurt yet.
Are you on the rainbow bridge being greeted by family members and old pets?
We're flying again.
Look.
What?
But how?
And where's that music coming from?
When trouble's around, Mighty Teen really will be found.
My hero.
That sounds so phoney in comic books, but now I get it.
Well, the emotions in comic books are real.
Just don't send away for the x-ray specs.
Ow.
Oh.
I hurt my finger in the world's most ill-advised barrel roll.
Well, lucky for you I have some Teen Bacteen in my utility belt.
At the risk of being redundant, my hero.
Often heard but never tiresome.
Has my childhood dream come true?
Are we in Paris?
Yeah.
I mean, oui.
This must be just how Lindy felt.
I wonder how long it took his cheeks to wake up.
Is there any way I can talk you out of going off to save the world?
But I already saved it.
You're my world.
Now I know why Superman ruined Lois for other men.
What?
Uh-- Oh, essay for my Comic Books as Literature class.
Hey, what's all that ruckus?
Did the French Embassy come for career week?
I think everyone's just weirdly excited to welcome Mr. Kraft back.
So Willard remembers nothing?
Nada.
He's principal again.
And even though the hours are long, the pay is short, and he's still ineffectual, he says he's never been happier.
Time for me to be out of the doghouse for my Childhood Dream spell.
- It looks like it worked.
- Yeah.
That Peace With Yourself spell that you put on Willard didn't hurt.
- Did it, Zellie?
- What?
You really are Aunt Snitch, aren't you?
Why are you still dressed like that?
I thought you fulfilled your pitiful dream of ruining my hairbrushes.
I want people to recognise me from the four-alarm fireman's calendar.
I'm Mr. November.
Well, this will certainly change your image.
I know, I know.
It's airbrushed.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I can't figure out an original gift to get Harvey for Valentine's Day.
Cologne he'll never use.
A red sweater he'll never wear.
A teddy bear holding a sign that says, "I heart you".
It's not easy coming up with something masculine, romantic and red.
Unless it's salmon.
Nothing says love like things that swim upstream.
Oh.
I can't believe this finally came.
Oh, Sabrina, here is the perfect gift for Harvey: A certificate for a special gondola ride through the Milky Way.
Which would be harder to explain, the flying gondola or that I actually know a good burger joint on that side of the galaxy?
Oh, don't worry, a mortal won't remember the ride but will be filled with a special feeling of love.
Like he's just sated himself on 40 pounds of coho.
I remember when you sent for this.
You were gaga over some mortal.
Mm.
Ulysses S. Grant.
Oh, that's right.
Good old Ulie.
- Whatever happened to him?
- He got old and died.
I can't believe you waited a hundred years for this.
Nothing's worth waiting Hey, it's got a coupon for free chocolates.
I know what I'm having for dinner.
But I don't think I'll redeem that free anvil coupon.
Harvey is gonna love this magic gondola ride.
I just hope he didn't get me the same thing.
Ah.
The first robin of spring.
That's him.
Devil bird.
That miserable little magpie has been keeping me up all night with his incessant chirping.
He must be stopped.
Oh, if only we had house cat to rid us of this terrible blight.
You're right.
What kind of feline am I?
Bird, prepare to be Salem-ated.
Sabrina, what if he actually catches that poor defenceless bird?
Little help.
Oh, boy.
- Never mind.
Whew.
Hoo.
I think we should downplay Valentine's Day around Hilda.
I just felt so sorry for her this morning.
I mean, you have Harvey and I have Willard.
If it's any consolation, I think she feels worse for you.
She's been so depressed ever since she had to send Daniel Boone back.
Now she just spends her days moping around the attic.
So you really never had an Indian friend named Mingo?
Heh.
No, ma'am, there isn't much companionship in the wild.
Believe me, when a tree falls in the forest, I hear it.
Well, you can stay here as long as you like.
I mean, until we get bored of each other, or my sister finds out.
Look at this.
It's just addressed, "To my valentine".
And it's not signed.
"Dear valentine, I wish I could express in words how truly special you are to me".
Harvey can be so sweet.
Sabrina.
Clearly this was written by a worldly, sophisticated, mature man.
My monkey.
Come on, this has "lovesick adolescent" written all over it.
Good morning.
Thought I could walk you to work.
Thank you for my valentine.
Valentine?
I didn't send you a valentine.
But I did get you this stick of gum.
It's sugarless.
And this watch.
Before I have to thank you for your high-tops, Valentine's Day isn't until Monday.
I knew that.
I can't walk you to work, because I have to go to the mall and get them to gift-wrap the stuff I already got you.
Oh, monkey, I'm so sorry you're sick.
Drink fluids.
I love you.
He's got a cold and he's got no idea it's Valentine's Day.
Well, if Harvey didn't send it and Mr. Kraft didn't send it, then it must have been sent for Aunt Hilda.
Sabrina, you're right.
And it couldn't have come at a better time.
Do we still have any of that venison left?
It's a wonder she can get up in the morning.
Aunt Hilda, look what came for you in the mail.
An anonymous valentine from some secret admirer.
It couldn't be for me.
I'll be up in the attic making sure our wiring is up to code.
She's breaking my heart.
Relax, I don't want your powder pouch or your chaw of tobacco.
Valentine's Day isn't until Monday.
Good, because I'm fixing to make you a nice fur cap.
If I could just trap that pesky black varmint I see scurrying around here.
That's our family pet, so if you're thinking of trapping him-- He loves peanut butter.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Why must you keep tormenting me?
I've got bad news.
That insane voice in your head is you.
No, it's that bird.
I know he's taunting me.
If I could just understand what he's saying.
Hey, everybody, look at this pathetic tub of fur who couldn't catch a bird if his life depended on it.
Now it's personal.
One double vanilla latte with a dash of cinnamon to kick it up a notch.
Thanks, but who needs cinnamon when I got your smile.
The number one perk about this job, besides the low pay and bad hours, is getting to flirt with every cute guy in Westbridge.
Hey, an anonymous valentine showed up at our house today.
- Maybe it's from one of these guys.
- You got an anonymous valentine?
The girl with the devoted boyfriend also gets the secret admirer?
And they say life isn't fair.
We're out of fat-free muffins, so push these calcium-rich cheese Danish.
So any big plans for Valentine's Day?
A gondala-riffic night out with Harvey.
Nothing special.
Though it appears our Sabrina may have a secret admirer.
Oh, really?
Any ideas?
Like any secret admirer, he prefers to remain anonymous.
You okay?
Oh.
I've gotta stop wolfing down those pickled eggs.
Cute, and she eats like a trucker.
Apparently, if you're in love with someone, even their involuntary muscle contractions are endearing.
There are lots of ways of trapping a bird.
The simplest is the "box and the piece of string" method.
Now, what animal would be slow enough to get caught--?
Whoa!
What happened?
I don't understand why you aren't more interested in who sent you this valentine.
Because for every handsome, debonair man that might have sent it, there's a guy with a plate in his head.
I just wanna see you happy.
I couldn't be happier.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be up in the attic.
While you're up there, could you grab me some buckshot, honeybee?
I wanna show Salem here how to load a musket.
I think honeybee's got some explaining to do.
- What does "stay in the attic" mean?
- Don't worry.
Your cat said he'd warn me at the first sign of trouble.
Watch out, here they come.
- Hilda, I can't believe-- - Hold on.
You wouldn't wanna hurt a person who Someone apparently loves very much.
Hey.
Hope you're not still mad about Valentine's Day, but I brought you a chocolate kiss and a real one.
Number one cure for hiccups, a spoonful of sugar.
Yes, but only the special sugar we have at home.
See you.
She's still mad.
This weekend, I'm buying myself a calendar.
Even though our paths only crossed for an instant, you'll always have a special place in my heart.
Ditto.
Boy, I'm really gonna miss him.
And now I'm done.
Do you wanna get pedicures?
You know, you should never have broken the Other Realm rules and kept him up in the attic all that time.
The basement was mouldy.
And now you're all alone.
Oh, you poor dear.
Interesting.
You were less irritating when you were angry.
You are so brave.
I am not gonna rest until I find out who sent you this valentine.
How are you gonna do that?
Interview every guy I've ever dated?
Excuse me.
All right, all right.
All the A's over by the cash register, please.
And have your handwriting samples out and ready for analysis.
I know this isn't the point of this exercise, but some of these guys owe me money too.
It's not fair.
I haven't used my magic, I haven't done a spell.
I haven't disobeyed my aunts, and yet I'm hiccupping sparkly pink hearts.
Yep, life's just one big adventure.
And speaking of adventure, come with me deep into the bush as we stalk the elusive dickey bird.
Sometimes I think you work at being annoying.
No, not really.
So that was a dead end.
But I think if we systematically retrace your steps over the last three months-- Sometimes I think you actually work at being annoying.
No, not really.
- Where have you been?
- Uh-- Sweaty brow, panicked expression, frantically looking through the magic book.
- Just what every parent wants.
- Look.
Sabrina, this looks serious.
What's the matter with you?
It's a very funny story.
I don't know.
You put Sabrina to bed, I'll call Cupid.
- Cupid?
- Cupid.
He handles all heart-related matters, literal or figurative.
Who gives the second opinion, the Easter Bunny?
What's with the getup, bwana?
I'm going big-game hunting.
It looks like a big game doodied on your hat.
Yeah, well, it happened to Hemingway all the time.
Wow, your heart's beating louder than the bass on a Deadhead's boom box.
Oh, I can't imagine why.
My anxiety level is in "there aren't enough lifeboats" territory.
Finally.
Where's Cupid?
Cupid's a little backed up with Valentine's Day, so he had to send his assistant.
- Where's the patient?
- Roland?
Okay, you've scared me, but I've still got the hiccups.
You know, some people collect stamps.
Other people seem to collect jobs.
Helping people find love is my true calling.
Plus, I already had the outfit.
So, what seems to be the problem?
Well, my heart is racing, I'm hiccupping valentines and you're in my bedroom.
How can you make all three go away?
Calm down.
I'm sure Roland can help.
Sorry, I meant that to sound sincere.
Now you mock me in front of my family?
Why, you  Salem, no.
Yick, ack, doolt!
My spleen.
- Oh.
I'm okay.
He's got nine lives and I'm working on the only one I got.
Well, I really won't know anything until I open her up.
Open me up?
I may be the only one concerned here, but he's not a doctor and I'm a bleeder.
The key to your heart.
No, that's to the Volvo.
Here it is.
Allow me.
What are you gonna do?
I knew I should've gotten The Club.
There's the problem.
Your heart is made of valentine's candy.
Oh, good, I was afraid it was gonna be something serious.
Okay, so I have a heart that's made of valentine candy that says, "Be mine.
No, be mine".
Why is this happening to me?
I eat oat bran.
Not a priority, you might think about getting your hinges oiled.
Well, Roland, don't just stand there fingering your tunic, help her.
I'll see what I can find in the magic book.
I remember this from the training manual.
Your condition is very serious.
You must follow my instructions precisely.
What do I have to do?
- First, take my hand.
- Then what?
Be patient.
Is this to make me feel better?
I don't know about you, but I'm in heaven.
- Get out.
- What do you want from me?
I'm just a temp.
These wings aren't even real.
Here it is.
"Candy Heart Syndrome".
Well, Roland was right about one thing.
Your condition is quite serious.
A witch gets it only around Valentine's Day when two mortals are vying for her heart.
Two?
What two?
Harvey's the only one vying for my heart.
- At least before it was chewable.
- There must be someone else.
Hilda, I'm so sorry, but this means that that valentine wasn't for you.
It was for Sabrina.
Oh, no, I'm crushed.
I can't go on.
Smirk, though your heart is breaking.
Oh, yeah, Aunt Hilda's problem's a lot more monumental than the girl with the candy heart.
It's true.
Sabrina's right.
We have to focus all of our attention and support on her.
All of it.
Help, emergency.
Come quick.
- Be right back.
- It did sound dire.
Well, no one can say they coddle me.
Salem, what's the matter?
I killed him.
I landed on him when I fell out of the tree.
All I wanted to do was scare, humiliate and emotionally scar him for life.
I didn't wanna hurt him.
- He's still breathing.
- Do birdie CPR, stat.
One, two, three, four, five.
Breathe.
Sorry to keep harping about this, but it says in this book that my symptoms are gonna get worse over the next couple of hours.
How can they get any worse?
Well, that's one way.
Do you think anyone will believe I have a live ferret in my bra?
He's alive.
Thank you, big guy.
Okay, next crisis.
Sabrina, you've got to stop one of those mortals from vying for your heart.
If you don't, you'll become cold and heartless and unable to love anyone.
- Not even Harvey.
- What?
But how can I get a complete stranger to stop liking me?
I know.
I gotta figure out who sent that valentine.
I have an idea.
We'll check out every boy you ever met.
Oh, no.
We're not going through that again.
I suppose you have a better idea.
Yes.
I'm calling in a valentine expert.
No.
Did you not hear me say no?
Well, if it isn't the girls from Ungrateful Junction.
Can't handle this one without me, huh?
Is there some extra fee we could pay for you to drop the attitude?
Just tell me who sent this.
Give me one good reason why I should help you do anything.
Because if you don't, your wings will no longer be on your back but someplace much more uncomfortable.
Oh, well, I guess we have a deal, then.
Old cherub party trick.
Josh?
Josh is my secret admirer?
And he still only pays me Well, there's a little matter of my fee.
Sabrina, you have to find Josh and get him to stop liking you.
Unless you wanna be the person who wears their heart on their sleeve literally.
Hey, look, it stopped.
I must be getting better.
I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but what's that music?
I think it's Jack Benny's old theme song, "Love in Bloom".
You know it isn't a dream It's love in bloom Now, cut that out.
Okay, so the consensus is I'm not getting better.
- Josh, I need to talk to you.
- Hey, you're back.
Got that oesophagus under control?
What's with the cheesy Muzak?
I thought the stereo was busted.
Can I use your jacket?
I'm a little chilled.
I'll bring it right back.
Okay, now its stopped.
Am I going crazy?
No, you are.
What's with the jackets?
Uh-- Kleptomania, one of my many obnoxious qualities.
You don't have any obnoxious qualities.
Sure I do.
Dozens.
I can Well, there I can be so - Cute?
- Really, you think so?
No, no, no.
Never.
I am so the opposite of cute.
Curses, done in by my own cuteness and lack of obnoxious qualities.
Well, if I can't get him to stop liking me, I'll just get him to like someone else.
Hey, Josh, have you ever noticed--?
It's love in bloom Well, have you?
Is there anything else I can do?
Fluff your pillow?
Regurgitate a worm?
No, no more TV for you.
Not since you flatlined during Popular.
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- Maybe.
Yeah, sure.
I guess I'm something of a romantic.
Great.
Hey, come here.
- Do you see love?
- No, but I do see a very terrified customer.
Oh, no, it isn't the spring It's love in bloom - Sabrina, are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Oh, what about her?
She's cute.
It's love in bloom What's the matter?
Why do you keep singing that song?
I'm a crazy, insane person.
The person no one would ever have a secret crush on.
Agree?
Not really.
But you should take the day off.
Relax.
Get some sleep.
Learn a new song.
The colour's coming back to his beak.
The insurance companies are right.
Untrained and unqualified people can treat the sick.
- Hello?
Hey, it's me.
I wanted to let you know the music stopped.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, is that stupid feather-butt dead yet?
When he finally kicks it, flush him.
Sabrina, are you all right?
Hey, watch it, buddy, not everybody likes dogs.
I swear, the blind think the world owes them something.
- Something's wrong.
- Oh, you think?
I don't have time to keep yapping with you broads.
I gotta go talk to Josh.
I've been way too nice to him.
Gotta tell the pathetic loser that he has gotta get a grip and move on.
Sabrina, wait.
Oh, no, Sabrina's becoming heartless.
If we don't do something soon, she'll be unable to love anyone.
We've gotta get Josh to stop liking Sabrina.
I think we both know what we have to do.
If you must, you must.
This is really gonna cost you this time.
Hey, Juan Valdez, we need to talk.
Sabrina, how's your stomach?
I brought you another kiss.
Well, they never said which boy I had to make stop liking me.
Wait, Roland, you can't go in there dressed like that.
College place.
I've got just the outfit.
Oh, yeah, the wings would have been much less noticeable.
There's Sabrina.
She's with Harvey.
I hope we're not too late.
Wow, it sure is an awfully long list of things you don't like about me.
Did I mention "stating the obvious"?
There's Josh.
Shoot him.
He has to stop liking Sabrina.
What?
And clear the way for farm boy?
Are you kidding?
I've been waiting for Sabrina to tell him off for years.
Sabrina, what's the matter with you?
Why are you saying all this?
Don't you love me?
Love?
Ha!
What's love?
No, everything is just fine.
If I can't have Sabrina, nobody can.
I don't love.
I don't love.
If you won't do your job, then I will.
I don't love anyone but you.
Hi, I'm Josh.
Capricorn.
I enjoy long walks, foreign films and your eyes.
You did that on purpose.
A frivolous rebound is exactly what you need.
What I need is to be an only child.
Tell me everything about you.
Don't leave anything out.
I'm already fascinated.
Okay, junior.
I'm so sorry.
It must have been a weird reaction to that special sugar at my house.
- Can you forgive me?
- Of course.
I knew it couldn't really be you.
You have the biggest heart of anyone I know.
Hey, farm boy.
Roland?
- What's your cousin doing here?
This.
Roland.
Are you okay?
Miss Spellman, I never realised what a devastatingly attractive woman you are.
Or that I'd ever use the word "devastatingly" in a sentence.
Happy Valentine's Day.
And now it's time for the Valentine's Day massacre.
Oh, aurora borealis.
Look at the stars, Harvey.
I'd rather see them reflected in your eyes.
Come on, what are you, three, four years older than me, tops?
Try 597.
Love can overcome that.
Can I peel you another grape?
Whatever.
Well, thank you for the worst Valentine's Day of my life.
House calls are pricey.
Besides, like I told you, everything will go back to normal after tonight.
Milk Dud?
Sing us a song of love.
Sabrina, to paraphrase the great Rod McKuen: Love is like-- Ah-aah!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ah.
No females.
Oh, no.
Not Sabrina's teenybopper basketball team.
Sandwiches are in the fridge.
We beat the boys.
How nice for America.
I love coaching those girls.
They're so sweet and innocent.
Can we have beer?
- No.
Aren't they adorable?
GIRLS : Girls rule, boys drool!
Girls rule, boys drool!
Stop it.
A man can stand only so much estrogen.
Kindly get those double-X chromosomers out of here so that I can try to regain my manly reverie.
Why, you little I guess you have to put up with a lot of females, so I'll just take the kids outside and practise free throws.
- Thank you.
- Girls.
Oh, we're gonna need a ball.
I know.
Come on, guys.
Outside, practise dribbling.
SALEM : No.
- Can that ball talk?
No, no, no, it's just a leak.
It's filled with hot air.
Well, Sabrina, with your grades and extracurricular activities, I think you can get into college anywhere.
Princeton, Boston College.
- I wanna go to Adams.
- MIT, Emerson.
But I love Adams.
I mean, its 21st-century concepts taught amid 19th-century beauty.
Yes, I read the brochure.
You have great grades.
You have lots of academic extracurricular activities.
You have excellent recommendations, but you have nothing in the arts.
Adams loves the arts.
I'm afraid you're not well-rounded enough for them.
How about Yale?
I wanted to go to Adams, but I guess I won't as long as my rÃ©sumÃ© looks like Pac-Man.
You know, I'm so proud of Sabrina.
Me too.
What'd she do?
You know, she's coaching those girls down at the community centre.
You know, we should do more for the community.
I stopped attending town-hall meetings per the request of the community.
- Isn't that enough?
Good news, good news.
The leash law for dogs was upheld in the Supreme Court.
From your mouth to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's ears.
No, I just got a letter from the Other Realm Processing Centre.
Guess who's finished serving his sentence as a cat.
Well, it can't be you.
You've got another 75 years left to go.
It must be one of Salem's underlings.
They got shorter sentences.
- I'll bet it's that Irish guy, Frederico.
- Or Steven.
- It's Duke.
- Wait a minute, I know.
Lucille.
It's Duke.
And he needs a place to stay.
Just until he gets off his paws and back on his feet.
Well, helping out would be a way to give back to the community.
Of course.
What better way to say thank you than by housing a felon?
No, by providing guidance to a woman who has paid her dues.
Duke.
He's a guy named Duke.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Astronomy, babysitting, chess, not arty.
Hey, nice game Saturday.
Your girls really did a number on my brother's team.
- Debate.
- I already gave you my side of it.
Look, I don't wanna get anyone in trouble, but one of your Marauders tends to block with her fists.
- Perfect.
- Not really, it's a bad habit to get into.
- I have to do this.
- Try out for the musicale?
Isn't that for kids with musical talent?
But I have to complete my circle.
Become more well-rounded, less half-eaten pie-like.
Are you gonna help me or not?
She'll be coming around The mountain when she comes She'll be coming around the mountain When she comes Aloha      Swing low, sweet chariot Coming for to carry me home  The trumpet wasn't so bad.
Fairly quiet.
I'm never gonna get into Adams.
No small yet challenging classes first year through fourth.
- That was a great brochure.
- What else are they looking for?
Stagehands, set builders, dancers-- Wait, I'm a dancer.
I took tap when I was 4.
- It'll come back.
- Uh-oh.
Problem.
It says they're looking for teams.
Dancers must audition with a partner.
Ow!
What about Yale?
No smoking, no drinking and no roughhousing.
And no plotting to take over the world.
Or any part thereof.
Don't worry.
I know I haven't been around an old crony for a while, but when Duke gets here, I'll do my very best to resist every temptation.
Come on, Hilda, we've got students waiting in the kitchen.
- Students?
Yes.
We're teaching English as a second language to some people from the neighbourhood.
It's a win-win situation.
We give back to the community and they learn to read our keep-off-the-grass sign.
Duke.
- Hi, boss.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Hey, you're a man now.
Oh, sorry.
Old habit.
Duke, you look great.
How the heck are you?
Wonderful.
- I miss being a cat.
- What?
I miss lying there in the sun, batting at dust particles.
Come here, big guy.
Are you nuts?
You don't have to eat kibble.
You'll reach things on the top shelf.
Dear Lord, man, you've got magic now.
Yeah, but it's pretty rusty.
Hey, you got any of those liver treats?
Okay, let's start with the basics.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay.
I quit.
That was my favourite coup.
Face it, overtaken French are just plain funny.
But you know something?
I've decided, if I have to be human, I wanna go straight.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, that's a good one, Duke.
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm the only one laughing.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
It's a crazy idea.
I haven't got the self-esteem to make it without breaking the law.
And you know the best way to get some self-esteem?
Do magic.
Come on, boy.
You know, there's an old teacher of mine I'd like to see.
He lived in the Ottoman Empire.
- Conjure him.
- Here goes.
Poastum ottoman ser alli - Close.
- Hey, guys.
Was that always there?
Mind coaching the girls tonight so I can rehearse my number with Harvey?
Honey, do you really think this is such a good idea?
I mean, you're not that musical.
Or coordinated or graceful.
Okay.
I wanna go to Adams, its rolling green hills and academic challenges.
Yes, we read the brochure.
If it means this much to you, we'll coach the Marauders.
We've been wanting to give back to the community.
But you have to find someone responsible to watch the clock shop for us tonight.
No problem.
There's nothing to worry about.
If a customer comes, give them a clock and take their money.
Look, you said you wanted to go straight.
This is the perfect way to see how an upstanding citizen functions.
It's all on the up and up.
Just don't tell my aunts.
- Say something.
- Help.
Good.
Gotta go.
Well, look who's running things now.
There have got to be easier ways to give back to the community.
How about we drop a big net from the ceiling?
You know, I've studied preadolescent psychology, and the best way to regain control is through reasoning.
And then we drop the big net?
Girls, girls, girls, may I have your atten-- Ooh.
- Hilda.
- Get the net?
And a fire hose.
And now she's joined by  Did I mention I really wanna get into Adams?
You're doing a great job running this clock shop.
Sabrina would be so proud.
Oh, please don't let a customer come in here.
Will you stop being such a fraidy-former-cat?
Look, there's a broken watch.
Fix it with magic.
Live a little.
Okay, here goes.
It's ticking, I did it, I did magic.
And right.
I knew you could.
I am so proud of you, Duke.
Now conjure a voting booth we can tamper with.
No, that'd be wrong.
I'll love you.
Okay.
Maybe we should close early today.
I'm sorry.
You left Hilda's clock shop in the hands of a former criminal with rusty magic and his evil boss.
- Really sorry.
- We were doing you a favour.
Zelda took numerous balls to the head.
All right, pass me the hair shirt.
Look, I know Duke was Salem's old lieutenant, but I thought he was a nice guy.
She gets things wrong a lot.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
As evidenced by that sweet-faced, ball-hurling Rachel Barnett.
Do you have any idea how long it's going to take us to zap that shop back together?
I can't believe I got that nice girl in such trouble.
I'll clean up the whole backroom tomorrow.
But first, I have to practise my tapping.
- Please?
- All right.
We'll get down there and start putting things back together before someone tells the police and we have yet another pesky investigation.
The worst was in 1730 when we had to explain our Oldsmobile.
- Hello, boss.
- Bennie.
Duke.
Some of the boys got the word that Duke had shed his fur.
I'm here to get him to join the gang again.
You know something, maybe I should.
I haven't got what it takes to make it in the legit world.
- Attaboy, come on.
- Stop, you can't take Duke.
- What's with the broad?
- Look, Duke's not one of you.
I realise I don't know him that well, I don't know you that well, but I'm going with my instincts.
He's a good guy, you're not.
Sure he is.
Do me a favour, call me when things don't work out.
You stood up for me, and when I got you in so much trouble.
True, but I believe you were under a bad influence.
Sure, blame the cat.
What?
I said, blame the cat.
I'm never gonna get it.
SABRINA : Duke's a good guy.
I fixed that clock.
Sabrina, I'm gonna make you a better dancer.
Nothing exploded.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.
Help, I have two right feet.
Well, actually, I have one right one and one wrong one.
- I'd help you pace, but-- - That's okay.
It was funny enough watching you come down the stairs.
- What did Duke say?
- He still can't remember the spell.
Well, did you mention that it probably had something to do with feet?
Yes.
We can't reverse the spell unless we know what it was.
We need him down here.
Sorry, but he's too upset to face that sweet, sweet girl, Salinas.
He's not very good with names.
Well, I like him too.
I mean, he's a nice man and he means well, and I would tell him that to his face if I could stop orbiting myself.
Oh, and I have an audition this afternoon.
Maybe this was it:  Ah.
Not it.
Well, I'm afraid we only have one choice.
We're gonna have to go into Duke's memory.
Oh.
Come on, Hilda.
I hate other people's memories.
They always dwell in the past.
I don't suppose you wanna make me a sandwich.
Ugh.
What a mess.
No wonder he can't remember anything.
We'll just have to dive in until we find Old Spells.
Why does it smell like cheese in here?
- It wouldn't have to be a big sandwich.
- Stop it.
Harvey?
Hey, I'm ready to rehearse.
"Duke's memory"?
Yeah, it's a gravestone for Salem's old owner.
A door in the middle of the living room?
Yes.
Please respect our religious beliefs.
"Repressed memories".
Shame on you.
Take a gander.
I thought I had problems.
Keep searching.
Wow, move over, Joan Crawford.
Sabrina, this thing is weird.
It's got a force field or something around it.
Did you come here to rehearse or to look at tombstones?
Rehearse.
I couldn't have anticipated the tombstone.
So are you gonna get up?
No.
I'm gonna sit here in judgement.
- Oh, gross.
- What?
A video memory of him attacking a mouse when he was a cat.
Oh, man, that is one mean mouse.
I don't understand.
You said we had to rehearse.
I changed my mind.
There is such a thing as overkill.
I'll see you later.
Now go.
- Found it.
- Where did you--?
Oh, you found old Duke's last request.
Yep, he wanted a door.
They feel pretty good, but I swear, that piggy is a little less cute.
It's the same toe.
Okay, well, I gotta get upstairs, change, go to school, convince Harvey that we do need to rehearse because I do wanna go to Adams.
Hey, how about this for an excuse?
I was just funning.
Hey, I say, if you haven't used it in a week, go for it.
Oh, hey, I just remembered.
Mind coaching the girls one more time for me during my audition?
- Duke could coach them.
- No, we'll manage.
They're young and should have their whole lives ahead of them.
You know, Harvey, we've been practising in our spare time all day, and you haven't gotten any better.
I think when somebody is doing you a favour, you shouldn't pick so much.
The kid dances like an old man.
I can do this.
I can fix him.
Well, you can't make the boy worse.
Wow.
- Harvey, that's great.
- I did it, I did it.
Okay, let's take it from the top.
I don't wanna.
But we have to practise.
Ha-ha.
You said "but".
Ha.
Butt, butt, butthead.
Uh-oh.
He's definitely not an old man anymore.
- Butt, butt.
- What's wrong with you?
Ow.
I'm telling.
Salem, what are you doing here?
Deh-- Came to cheer you on.
Wait a minute, where's Duke?
Uh-- Duke who?
Tell your friend to remove whatever spell he's put on Harvey.
What makes you think he put a spell on him?
I've got big-boy pants on.
Just a hunch.
Tell him to fix Harvey.
Harvey who?
Well, at least we found the trick.
Yep, it doesn't matter if you're a nice coach or a tough coach.
As long as you're a tall coach.
Okay, okay.
Let's try a three-man weave, ladies.
Maybe we should have called them ladies.
We called them everything else.
I wonder how the audition's going.
Harvey.
Ah!
Tickle, tickle.
Oh!
I hated this game when I was 4 and I still hate it.
Thank you, Bobby and Barbara.
Are Sabrina and Harvey ready?
Where's Duke?
Right here.
I can't remember the spell.
It's something feetum something.
Terrific.
I don't have time to go into your memory.
Thanks a lot, Duke, you've ruined my only chance to get into Adams.
When you're a cat, this thing doesn't happen.
Ruining people's lives?
It happens to me all the time.
And now Sabrina Spellman and Harvey Kinkle.
And here's where my partner would normally come in.
Let's give them the old soft shoe.
Thank you, wow.
I didn't know a con man could dance so well.
Well, I may be a criminal, but I did take cotillion.
Sabrina, congratulations.
You've got the part.
Whoo-hoo.
Need a little help.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Oh, no.
Harvey, naughty boy.
He has to be still so we can reverse the spell.
- Harvey, you want some candy?
- No.
- Freak.
- I have an idea.
What's that?
It's a fax of the stupid rehearsal schedule for my stupid musicale.
I'm stupid Villager Number 3.
So all your hard work paid off.
No, it's so time-consuming, I'm gonna have to give up coaching the Marauders.
Well, on the bright side, fewer concussions.
This stinks.
I knocked myself out and now I have to give up something I love.
Well, honey, you can always turn the part down.
But I need it for Adams and its state-of-the-art library with You know what?
To heck with Adams.
I'm gonna send my application just the way it is.
No arts.
If they don't want me, their loss.
Pearls before swine.
I'm assuming that means you're on my side.
Another good thing came out of this.
Zellie and I figured out a way we could give back to the community.
Oh, what are you gonna do, clean highways?
Run a food bank?
Help people convert their Y2K shelters back into bomb shelters?
No, we actually gave a person back to the community.
Observe.
Excellent.
The elderly should tap more often.
You know, I'm really sorry I passed out right before the audition.
Oh, no problem.
It was nice of you to get me to your house and nurse me back to health, although I still don't know how you did it.
Oh, I'm deceptively strong.
When I was out, I had some crazy dreams.
I met John Salley.
He threatened me with a time-out.
I think that means you have a fear of flying.
- Just one thing.
- What's that?
Why do I keep wanting to eat paste?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
There's your Other Realm Gazette.
I need to collect.
You're the newspaper boy?
My mother took a lot of folic acid when I was in utero.
My aunts aren't home, I don't have money.
Little Mikey gets stiffed.
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- Oh, sure, come back tomorrow.
"Oh, I don't get paid till Friday".
Everybody's got an excuse.
- I give excellent service, but-- - Excellent service?
Last Tuesday's paper was from 1948, and Monday's paper was wrapped around a fish.
I've been sick.
When we get our replacement papers, you'll get paid.
Fine.
Oh, well, it looks like it's gonna be sunny tomorrow.
Hey, listen to this wedding announcement: "Laird Prescott to marry Annabelle Saberhagen".
Is she any relation to you?
Me?
Why, no, of course not--  She's my daughter.
Daughter?
You have a daughter?
Salem has a daughter?
He's 500 years old.
He didn't spend all that time watching television.
Annabelle hasn't been in touch with him for decades.
It's caused him many sleepless nights, which is why he sleeps all day.
It's their family, their rift.
We leave it alone.
And that's coming from me, a real busybody.
Salem has a daughter?
I know it's personal and I don't wanna pry, so I won't ask any questions.
Thank you.
Annabelle blames me for being away so much when she was growing up.
Is that because you were away so much when she was growing up?
Yeah, but collapsing governments isn't something you can do from home.
I'm finding it hard to be impartial here, but there's so little you've done right.
- Why didn't you ever call?
- I'm too guilty to call.
And then when I was found guilty, I really felt too guilty to call.
But I still love my little pumpkin.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Just spitballing, but So let me get this straight.
My father is your house pet?
A very contrite house pet.
And he loves you very much and he desperately wants to share your wedding with you.
He does?
You've certainly got your father's cry.
I always wanted him to be in my wedding, I just wanted him to ask.
Well, I'm asking for him.
Close enough.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so overwhelmed.
There's so much to planning a wedding.
I could help.
I could fold napkins or handle the guest book, park cars.
Would you be my maid of honour?
Oh, as if we know each other.
Who better to share my special day than the person responsible for mending the rift between my daddy and me?
Other than a sister or a college roommate or a lifelong friend, I can't think of anyone.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Guess what this is.
You have a shop full of unhappy customers.
No, it's bread.
It's from that bakery that we both loved so much back in the 17th century.
Have a bite.
Mm.
Mm.
Where did you get this?
I thought we cleaned out the freezer.
I found the instruction manual to the lost-in-time clock.
And I was so bored, I actually read it.
Check out all the great things this clock can do.
Been able to make it tell time yet?
Not yet, but it can answer questions about history, which I don't care about, but you will.
And it can bring back anything you want from any year you want.
And it's a salad spinner.
Go ahead, play with the clock.
Well, shouldn't we be out there helping the customers?
Oh, they'll go away.
They always do.
I can't believe my little girl has finally forgiven me.
From here on in, whatever pumpkin wants, pumpkin gets.
And she wants you to perform the duties of father of the bride.
Are you nuts?
I just wanted to go and watch it from the back like Stella Dallas.
I can't do father-of-the-bride stuff.
I'm a cat.
You can write a cheque and walk her down the aisle.
Well, what will I do on the father-daughter dance?
Ride on her shoe?
And I can't-- Hey, would you be my second and perform any duties I'm too furry to do?
Maid of honour, backup father of the bride.
Fine, but I draw the line at catering.
I'm so glad you two patched everything up.
Me too.
We need dates.
Oh, good heavens, yes.
We can't go unescorted to a wedding.
They'll try to fix us up with every loser in the place.
You can hook up with my uncle Morty.
You mean, Uncle Inappropriate Behaviour?
Well, I wish I could take Willard.
But fortunately, it's in the Other Realm, so you can't.
This looks like a job for Mystery Date.
- What?
- Another feature of our little clock.
All we have to do is state which qualities we want in our mystery date, and then spin the hands of the clock.
I'd like someone who is independent, adventurous and likes long walks on the beach.
Leif Ericson?
You forgot to say, "But who isn't a Viking".
I don't wanna pick, but maybe it's time for you to clean out your locker.
They're bridal magazines.
Somehow I got roped into helping plan a wedding.
I was talking about the old sandwiches.
Sabrina and I share lockers.
It's kind of like living together.
I'm all gooey inside.
Looks like Sabrina's planning a wedding.
I wonder whose.
If the tux fits, buddy.
That doesn't sound like Sabrina.
We're going to college.
I'm driving the Indy 500.
No way she's thinking about marriage.
That's what my brother thought.
Now he's got three kids.
Copernicus may have realised that the Earth isn't the centre of the universe, but he hasn't realised that he isn't.
- I'm going to spin again.
- No, it's my turn.
You've already sent back 16 guys.
Go through your maybe pile again.
Well, Leif is smelling better now that he's dry.
I want someone who'll take out the garbage.
In other words, the outdoorsy type.
- Davy Crockett?
- I'm Daniel Boone.
Excuse me.
Heh.
I think the real Davy Crockett would be a little less touchy.
Josh.
If you're gonna drool over Sabrina, do it over the spill tray.
Ah-- I do not like Sabrina.
Hey, Harvey's here.
Can I take my break now?
Just finish wiping the counter.
If you think your love can wait that long.
I'm just gonna go up to her and ask her about the magazines.
That's a good idea.
I think it's about time you two had the talk.
The talk?
Yeah, you bring this up with Sabrina and you're gonna have talk to her about whether you wanna marry her.
Which you don't.
That's gonna upset her.
She's gonna break up with you.
And then you can go to motocross with me on Saturday night.
I gotta go think.
How about I take two breaks later?
You know what's wrong with women?
I'm dying to know.
They keep yanking that leash until the poor dog turns around and bites.
I'll embroider that on a pillow.
Do you wanna hear what I just heard?
You know, Marnie, you're nothing but a gossipmonger.
- It's about Sabrina and Harvey.
- I don't care if it's about Sabrina and-- Tell me later.
Let's check the fifth at Aqueduct.
Daddy?
Your daughter's here.
Oh, no.
I've waited 50 years to see her and she picks now?
Oh, why did I choose today to sample the new Mexican Science Diet?
Oh.
Daddy, where are you?
Be right there.
Oh, Daddy.
Pumpkin.
I missed you, my precious little girl.
Me too.
Oh, is that sand on your paws?
Hey, I thought Harvey was coming back, but since he hasn't, can I take my two breaks plus one from tomorrow and leave now?
Oh, man, I hate word problems.
Here's a hint.
The answer's yes.
Go.
Now, what exactly did you hear about Harvey and Sabrina?
It sounded like they might be breaking up.
Apparently, Harvey won't be standing in the way of destiny anymore.
Okay, good.
Because I am not letting Sabrina get away again.
The next time I see her, I'm asking her out.
Oh, I forgot my backpack.
That didn't count.
What do you think about this for my bouquet?
Bouquet?
- At a wedding?
- What am I missing here?
At an Other Realm wedding, the maid of honour carries a sapling.
- You mean a tree?
- Just a small one.
And it's planted in a sacred grove.
And every year, the couple visits it on their anniversary.
Oh, that's kind of sweet.
Not surprisingly, a popular wedding gift is manure.
Okay, but it doesn't get any weirder than that, right?
Are you sure I'm supposed to be wearing this?
I might have dyed the boots to match the dress.
Yep, that's the traditional maid-of-honour outfit.
Don't you guys ever question these traditions?
It's been traditional not to.
Hey, it's Davy Crockett.
- Daniel Boone.
- Sorry.
Good Lord, Sabrina, you're the maid of honour?
So?
Other than looking like a before picture, it doesn't seem that hard.
Oh, that's right.
You've never been to an Other Realm wedding before.
Well, good luck.
This way.
- Are they bunny-hopping?
- Of course.
It symbolises the importance of whimsy in a lasting relationship.
- And what do the sheep symbolise?
- Nothing.
Apparently, this place is close to a ranch.
I'm ready.
Wow.
I want to say something wise and wonderful right now, but I can't think of anything, except I love you  and I hope the band knows some Ohio Players.
Oh, look, there's my beloved Laird waiting for me.
Isn't it amazing how all men look great in a suit of armour?
This is the kind of music that Brian Boitano wears the dark skates for.
It's the Other Realm wedding march.
Time to start down the aisle.
So where's the sapling I'm supposed to carry?
Behind you.
The bigger the tree, the greater the love.
Couldn't you have married for money?
Thanks for letting me practise what I'm gonna to say to Sabrina on you.
No problem.
You don't really think she'll start weeping and shouting, "Dear heavens, this is gonna change everything forever," like you did, do you?
Put some shoulder in it, Sabrina.
You're holding up the whole wedding.
Hey, Jim, did you bring your Bowie knife?
It's Daniel.
The wedding ceremony is important for all of us because it includes ancient traditions--  Ancient traditions that remind us of the sacred sanctity of marriage.
Let's blow up the balloon.
You gotta be kidding me.
The maid of honour always blows up the balloon.
The inflated balloon symbolises Ahem.
The inflated balloon symbolises that a couple needs--  - Ugh.
- Sabrina, you can use magic.
You could have used magic to bring the tree in too, but guess it's too late to tell you that.
The inflated balloon symbolises that a couple needs to love each other with every breath.
Please tell me that's all I have to do.
Pretty much.
And now for the most sacred moment of the wedding ceremony, the ring.
I don't have it.
I didn't bring a ring.
That's the ring.
The father of the bride will now wrestle the father of the groom for the right of his daughter to marry his son.
Okay, now the wedding's just getting weird.
- Don't worry, you can take him.
- Me?
You're my second, and I'm protected by the Humane Society.
Sabrina, please fight for me.
If you don't win, I can't marry Laird.
And I just can't imagine life without Laird.
But you can imagine life without me?
What's up, Kinkle?
As soon as Sabrina gets in, I'm gonna have the talk with her.
Really?
I mean, well, good luck, man.
There goes another dog who's about to shed his leash.
According to my sources, the breakup is imminent.
If I understand my dog analogies.
Thanks for the info.
Now why don't you get back to work?
That's code for: Why don't you get back to work?
Ladies and gentlemen.
In this corner, weighting 267 pounds, the father of the groom, Xavier "The Avenger" Prescott.
This part of weddings always gets me.
And in this corner, at 110, Sabrina "Hasn't Got a Nickname" Spellman.
- What do I do?
- Go for his weak point.
Which is where?
Don't let him pin you or the match is over.
Go, Sabrina.
Kick him.
Gouge his eyes.
Really.
This is a wedding.
You know, whoever catches the wrestler gets married next.
Next wedding, I'm just sending a gift.
Sabrina, your slip is showing.
This isn't right.
I can't just sit here and watch while poor Annabelle loses her love.
Not to mention Sabrina getting filleted.
Annabelle, I'm going in the ring.
I'm so glad I spent three hours doing my hair.
Saved by Daniel Boone.
It's Daniel Boone!
Sorry.
No.
One, two, three.
The winner.
Please stay down.
I'm glad you won.
With my other son, I got beat up and I've got gypsies as relatives.
And now for the exchanging of the ring fingers.
Oh, gross, gross, gross.
You are now part of each other forever.
I declare you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Finally, a tradition I've heard of.
Aren't you gonna kiss me?
It's beautiful, just beautiful.
Okay, it's all right.
Well, I dropped Sabrina off at work and sent Leif back to Greenland.
You did send Daniel back, didn't you?
Hey, it's a rule.
What is that vile odour?
It's possum pie.
The real stuff.
- Not with Ritz crackers.
- Ugh!
I think you might have gotten some glands in there.
There's my pie.
So we already have nicknames?
Thank you, darling.
Mm.
Well, I have to send you back, so I finally picked a date.
How about the 12th of never?
What are you doing here?
After Harvey talks to Sabrina, he's gonna need someone around to pick up the pieces.
After Harvey talks to Sabrina, you might wanna pick up the pieces.
Check.
If all goes well, you and I will have nothing more to talk about.
Kinkle.
Good luck, man.
Thanks.
- Hey.
- Hey, so, what's ticking, chicken?
I'll never say that again.
Sabrina, I love you.
Really?
Even after "What's ticking, chicken"?
I bought you this.
A ring?
Harvey, does this mean what I think it means?
Probably not.
See, I don't wanna get married.
I'm not ready.
Good, neither am I. You're not?
Of course not, I'm still in high school.
I have my whole life ahead of me.
I'm not ready to have someone carry a tree down an aisle.
- A tree?
- Yeah, my dad's kind of wooden.
Wait, but I'm confused.
Why did you give me a ring if you don't wanna marry me?
It's a promise ring.
It's to let you know that someday, a long time from now, if we haven't grown apart or joined some strange religious cult, only if you want to, of course, I hope that maybe we will get married.
That's so sweet.
And, Harvey Kinkle, I accept your proposal to not get married.
What happened?
What happened?
Who knows?
Hey, guys, look what Har-- I swear, no one in this place even knows I'm alive.
Aunt Hilda, I thought Dan was going back to Kentucky of yesteryear.
Don't tell your Aunt Zelda, but he's gonna stay a while.
Apparently, he wants to court me.
I'm game.
You brought him down here to embarrass me?
And the house smells like possum.
Are you supposed to be Davy Crockett?
Fine.
I'm Davy freaking Crockett.
That's right, all those guys in buckskin jackets look the same.
Honey, I think it might be the coonskin hat.
Oh, they do have a point.
Remember the Alamo.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
I'm still having trouble turning myself into other things.
- Sabrina.
- Oh, sorry.
I was thinking about Senior Skip Day again.
A snow day with no snow?
A summer day in the middle of spring?
Forget the metaphors.
It's another day we don't have to go to school.
Well, try to focus.
I have to pass the test for my witch's licence.
Right, focus.
Well, try something simple.
Turn yourself into a pomegranate.
Hey, maybe we should go to the mountains for Senior Skip Day.
DREAMA : Sabrina?
Sabrina.
What?
Sorry, gotta concentrate.
- Dreama?
Yeah?
I said pomegranate, not Pomeranian.
Don't make me get the rolled-up newspaper.
- Zellie.
- There.
I've just finished reading everything there is to know about Other Realm medicine.
Yet you can't name me three out of the five Marx Brothers.
I was getting bored with the other sciences.
I want to heal.
Well, you can start by healing my wardrobe.
- Lend me your red sweater.
- No, you spill.
Even with all this knowledge, I'm still gonna have to have some practical hands-on experience.
Please?
Do it for the sweater.
I look really cute in it.
Okay, your 15 minutes is up.
Give me back my lung.
- Two more minutes.
- No, I need to go up some stairs.
Fine, but you're not being very supportive.
Ah!
Thank you.
Oh!
I take it this is your slide.
Okay, as intriguing as the aptly named Boer War is, I can't stop thinking about Senior Skip Day.
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be great.
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't know, maybe go to a park.
Canoes, picnics   Sabrina.
- What?
What is the answer to whatever the question is that you asked me.
Am I right?
- I'm really starting to worry about you.
- I was having super-vivid daydreams.
It was the weirdest daydream I ever had.
You and Sabrina were having a picnic in the middle of the class.
- And you were wearing seersucker.
- Weird.
Okay, Brad is a witch-hunter who can turn me into a mouse, and now he can see my daydreams.
I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about.
Gotta go.
Ow!
Ow!
And need I say it again: Ow!
Hold still.
Do you wanna borrow my necklace or don't you?
Obviously, you skipped the chapter on bedside manner.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.
Problem.
Definitely feel a little warm.
Let's see, a temperature, vivid daydreams visible to a witch-hunter.
- Having any trouble concentrating?
- Not really.
Aren't puppies great?
I've got an idea.
Oh, don't make me call Child Services.
Hold on.
Okay.
Just hit the lever.
I knew it.
You've got spring fever.
I always wanted to work at a carnival, but I've got too many teeth.
"Spring fever occurs when a young witch is looking particularly forward to something".
Senior Skip Day.
It's tomorrow, and it's all I can think about.
- Oh, phooey.
- What's the matter?
- I'm not gonna combust, am I?
- No.
I don't need to treat you.
"Spring fever will disappear once the patient has experienced what she's focused on".
So after you have your Senior Skip Day, you'll be cured.
But why is Brad seeing her daydreams?
Well, he's obviously hypersensitive.
Do not do any magic around him.
- No problem.
I'll go take a nap.
- Nap at school.
Be careful, Hilda.
Do not let her hand touch your fingers.
Spring fever can be very contagious among witches.
When exactly did Aunt Zelda - become a doctor?
- This morning.
And that's when I told coach, "I know they make your muscles bigger, but don't steroids also kill you"?
What is that man think--?
Oh, ice cream.
- Are you okay?
- I am now.
Attention, seniors.
In the past, there has been a tradition called Senior Skip Day, where teachers look the other way while students become truants.
Heh-heh.
Well, not on my watch.
Senior Skip Day is hereby cancelled.
Music to my ears.
Ha-ha.
Wait, did he just say no Senior Skip Day?
But I need Senior Skip Day to cure me.
And I need it to clean my carburettor.
Mr. Kraft, you can't cancel Senior Skip Day.
Why?
Because you and your annoyingly perky friends will be sad?
- Well, that's my intent.
- No, because Because Never in my life have I seen such deplorable behaviour.
- Or smelled such cheap cologne.
- But No.
Not the walk of shame.
I know I was making a point.
Yeah, and I'm sure the aliens in your dental work understood it perfectly.
I've gotta get Skip Day back.
No, if you don't lend me your sunglasses, I don't lend you my small intestine.
Oh, fine, thwart my attempts to come up with a spring-fever vaccine.
Spring fever?
Horrible stuff.
I had it once during an invasion, and for the first time in history, the French won a war.
And poor Sabrina has it now.
Oh, no, that means it's in the house.
Gah?
- There.
You're alone, you're germ-free, and the plastic lining muffles your complaints.
I don't care for the echo.
Come on, seniors.
If we all stick together, we can help get Senior Skip Day back.
Back.
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me Bring back--  Sabrina?
- Yeah?
I've got good news.
I was just talking to Joey Slotnick.
The big kid who was a senior last year too.
The one who still enjoys Babar?
Well, he said that principals always come out against Senior Skip Day.
It's for the record.
Their lips say no, but their arms and legs I forget how it goes, but they really do want us to skip.
Thank you.
This means I can be cured.
Hey, look at the ceiling tiles.
Don't they make neat patterns?
She does enjoy her life.
Dear diary, as I complete hour one of my new life in a bubble, I realise it's the little things I miss most.
Dandelions, sunsets, the smell of bacon in the morning.
Hmm.
Speaking of bacon, I wonder if can I get one of those George Foreman Mean Lean Grilling Machines in here.
Have you finished your part of our history project?
- We need to put them together.
- I'm trying, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Greetings and salutations, Sabrina.
I'm the Homework Elf.
You can play to your heart's content, and when you come back, I'll have done your project for you.
And I'll have cobbled you some new shoes.
Italian leather?
Sabrina?
Sabrina.
You're getting worse.
Our project is due this afternoon.
You could use a little spring fever.
What was I saying?
That you would be quiet, just until Senior Skip Day.
All right, attention, seniors.
Ahem.
Just in case any of you thought I was bluffing, I will make sure that any senior missing from school on Senior Skip Day will spend the next four years celebrating College Skip Day.
Oh, no, no Senior Skip Day?
I just gave Dreama spring fever.
I'm turning Mr. Kraft into a toad.
- You can't do magic here.
- Why not?
We're in the Other Realm.
Okay, you've passed daydreams and gone directly to delusional.
No.
And now there's no Senior Skip Day to save you.
Okay, listen.
Stay here.
Don't do magic.
I gotta go call my aunt.
Hello?
Hello?
You're gonna have to speak up.
Zelda, is that my ear?
I'm almost done with it.
I'll bring it right back.
Can you hear me now?
Miss Spellman, the strange mole-like creatures who live in the centre of the Earth can hear you.
The next time you take someone's appendage, ask.
Can you hear me now?
- Oh!
Don't scream, dear.
I'll be right there.
Oh, cool, you pierced it.
Ah.
Finally, I can relax.
Dreama!
You stay here and keep an eye on Dreama.
I'll go get Skip Day back.
Thanks, Aunt Zelda.
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna keep my eye on you.
Hey, look how weird my knuckles are.
But, Mr. Kraft-- The more people try to persuade me to be lenient about Senior Skip Day, the madder I get.
- But-- - I am very passionate about this issue.
And I will not relent.
Willard, let the kids have their Skip Day.
Okay.
And why do these walls feel so cool?
KRAFT : Attention, seniors, Skip Day is back on.
Aunt Zelda did it.
Wasn't there someone sitting here a second ago?
Dreama.
I'm thirsty.
Was that water fountain always there?
You're a freak girl.
I swear, Dreama, sometimes I think you're a witch.
Oh, no.
A witch-hunter said the words "you're a witch"?
And you haven't turned into a mouse.
Finally, things are going well.
Yep, straight to well in a handbag.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda?
- I'm not bending any whiskers, am I?
What, dear?
Brad turned Dreama into a mouse and it's all my fault.
And I thought you making me allergic to oxygen was bad.
Oh, let it go.
I made you an antihistamine.
Will you two focus?
Hey, maybe we should paint this room pink.
- I think I might be able to help.
- Really?
- You don't mean buy a cage, do you?
- No.
See, I've been forming a theory about witch-hunting genes based on my medical books.
If we can remove Brad's gene, we can break the spell and turn Dreama back.
Bear in mind, Zelda's been practising medicine for an entire day.
But there's a catch.
See, the gene can only be extracted during the hour right after a witch-hunter has turned someone into a mouse.
So we don't have much time.
- See?
- Either that or our cookies are done.
I suggest you get Brad over here now.
Oh, good.
I get all the easy stuff.
Don't worry, Dreama.
We're going to help you.
I'm filled with compassion for her situation, but let's get this filthy vermin out of here.
What's this?
A mouse?
Let's see.
I can leave the bubble, risk contamination and have a mouse to play with.
Or I can stay in the bubble, be healthy Too complicated.
Hi, Brad.
Wanna come over to my house?
- Why?
- Why?
Why not?
Aren't mushrooms gross?
- You're weird.
- Yeah, you're right, I am weird.
And you should come see my weird house.
Leave me alone, woman.
- Harvey, I need your help.
- Sure, what is it?
I need I You are really cute.
You need to compliment me?
No.
I need you to help me get Brad over to my house.
Please don't ask any questions.
If you love me, you'll get him there.
And I'll explain it all later.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Harvey Kinkle.
You're a lifesaver, literally.
Ooh.
A Life Saver.
That would be really good right now.
Women.
Okay, I've checked everything over.
And even though my plan is extremely complicated and difficult, I really think it'll work.
- Hilda, have you boiled the water?
- I'm so tired.
Do you have an antidote for your antihistamine?
Where are Harvey and Brad?
Oh, what's the difference between culottes and gauchos?
They're here.
Hey, Sabrina.
Um Brad's here to see your big-screen TV with the sports-only channels.
- Where is this baby?
- It's right this way.
I'll explain later.
Love you, bye.
I wonder if I should be suspicious.
Nice to see you, Brad.
Gum?
No.
Kinkle said there was a big-screen.
Yes.
But first, gum, then TV.
Don't worry.
It's magical gum so he can't say we're witches.
It's also a quick-acting anaesthetic.
Perfect.
Now for the operation.
Operation.
I love that game.
This is a very delicate procedure and I will need your full cooperation.
How about a song?
We'll need a lot of electricity.
There.
I'm brewing a storm.
It should be here just in time.
It won't be long now, Dreama.
Could you hold my eyelids open while I make some black coffee?
Quiet.
This must be done precisely.
Mop.
I am not a scullery maid.
My brow.
Zoo Zoo.
- It's Mr. Kraft.
I'll get rid of him.
Quickly.
You know what we don't have a lot?
Fritters.
Zelda, we need to talk.
We need-- - What are you wearing?
- Oh, you mean this?
We are big fans of ER around here, and we're playing the home version.
- So maybe we should talk later.
- No, no, no, we need to talk now.
- What's the problem?
- Senior Skip Day.
Now, you made an excellent argument for reinstating it, and I was swayed by it and your persistent begging.
- I don't want them to have one.
- But it's a life-or-death situation.
Sabrina has got to have her senior-- I mean, all the kids would really enjoy a break.
But cancelling it was gonna be my mark on Westbridge.
Principal Brown was there for integration.
I was gonna be there for this.
- Uh-- Excuse me for just a second.
Just-- Let him cancel Senior Skip Day.
You'll never get rid of spring fever.
- You'll keep daydreaming.
- I know, but Dreama's more important than whether or not I function again.
I don't wanna spend the next hundred years changing cedar chips.
You're right.
The kids don't need a skip day.
I think you should work on getting rid of weekends.
Okay, okay.
I just hope we can feel close again.
Hold me.
Poor dear.
Got to go.
- There's your car.
Run.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Boy, I picked a heck of a time to wear my steel-toed shoes.
At last, and we still got some time left.
Hungry.
Hello?
Guess I'm gonna have to search my gums for food particles again.
What could they be doing that's so important they forgot to feed the cat in the bubble?
- Zellie?
- Speak to me.
I'm okay.
My fillings are a little hot, - but I'm fine.
- This may sound a little callus, what with you still smouldering, but you have a witch-hunter in preop.
Oh, I can't touch Brad.
I'll electrocute the mortal.
Touch me.
Maybe it'll perk me up.
I'm so sorry, Sabrina.
I should be fine in an hour or so.
Maybe if we get Dreama one of those little hamster wheels, she'll start to adjust to life as a mouse.
No.
I have an idea.
Brilliant, Sabrina.
With all this electricity, I'll make an excellent transformer.
I've always had a yen to groom a poodle.
Hilda, with Sabrina unable to focus, you're going to have to perform the operation.
Normally, I'd find a way to weasel out, but there's too much at stake.
- I'll do it.
- Great.
Let's get going.
Before your medication kicks in.
Keep it down.
I've got a good stare going.
Focus, honey, focus.
You're our only hope.
- You've got to operate on Brad.
- Right.
Now, you've got to place the electrodes in the precise spots in a precise order.
- Sorry.
- Place the first one just above his left eye.
Piece of cake.
Now, the second one goes between his index finger and his thumb without touching his palm.
I'm all over it.
Slowly, slowly.
Not that slowly.
Sabrina.
Whee.
If you tilt your head back, it's a real rush.
Hey, it's the girl whose friend got turned into a mouse.
Shouldn't you be working?
Oh, dear, we've lost her.
Actually, we've lost everyone.
I'm talking to myself, aren't I?
I've gotta stay focused for Dreama.
I've got a job to do.
- What's this?
- Just put it right there.
Good, good.
Now, the last one goes on Brad's tongue.
- Gross.
- Do it.
Bing, bang, boom.
Give me another task before I'm as unfocused as a camera pointed at Cybill Shepherd.
Last step.
Pull the switch.
- It didn't work.
- You got it, look.
The witch-hunter gene is a tiny pair of blue jeans?
Quick.
Drop them in the acid wash.
You did it.
I'm back.
Okay.
Hand me the scalpel.
Oh.
- Get some rest, Dreama.
- And don't eat too much cheese.
Or your young.
Well, things turned out okay.
Except for these floorboard creases and the fact that you still have spring fever.
I'm just glad I did the right thing.
And for what it's worth, I haven't had any daydreams in a while.
Sabrina, you're cured.
I had a hunch that if you focused on the operation and snapped yourself out of your daydream, you would cure yourself.
Now you don't need Senior Skip Day and I have a new item for my medical paper.
If that speech didn't zone you out, you're definitely cured.
We have to figure out whether we can send Brad home.
- Do you think he's ready?
- He shoots, he scores.
Oh, hat trick.
Ha-ha-ha.
Ace.
Knock out.
General Hospital?
Oh, yeah, he's ready.
Let him have some fun.
I mean, since we almost killed him.
You know, you gotta give me points for getting Brad over to your house.
Major points.
For trusting you, for not asking any questions.
Big, huge, pendulous points.
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.
So, what's going on?
I just needed some time alone with Brad to discuss why he dislikes me.
It wasn't easy, but I have a feeling things will be getting better.
Really?
That's great because Brad's really my best friend.
And now that he doesn't have a witch-hunter gene, I get to start over with Brad.
- I bet he even likes me.
Hey, Spellman.
Karen Ann Quinlan called.
She wants her personality back.
A-ha!
- I forgot to factor in just one thing.
- What's that?
Brad's just a jerk.
But at least now, we get to do magic on him.
My pants!
Hasn't it been pleasant around here lately?
- Sort of extra peaceful?
- I know.
What's different?
Salem.
We forgot all about him.
Oh, no, it's the grasshopper in the jar all over again.
What?
You said Mitzi joined the circus.
Salem, are you okay?
Talk to us.
Oh, please, don't bother me.
I'm trying to set the world record for grooving.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Done yet?
Done yet?
Your books are an unmitigated disaster.
- I haven't even begun.
- No hurry.
Take your time.
I was up planning the senior sleigh ride and now I can't find my backpack.
It's right here where you left it 12 hours ago, which begs the question, did you do any homework?
Did I mention I managed to book an entire team of Clydesdales and mull cider?
Sabrina, you know homework comes first.
Unless it's something icky like bookkeeping.
Come on, I'm 18.
I can vote in two realms.
I can be in charge of organising my own schedule.
I'm sorry, but if you live under our roof, you live under our rules.
Oh, Lord, I've swallowed Mother.
Fine.
Your stupid roof, your stupid rules.
Oh, the frigid wind of teen rebellion.
Oh, look, the blimp.
Everyone's talking about how cool the sleigh ride's gonna be.
Oh, it's great, but did anyone offer to do my calculus homework?
You know, sugar-induced comas aren't all they're cracked up to be.
Last night, coach made a new rule.
Only three sodas a week, I reached my quota before he finished talking.
I'm sure it was the carbonation he objected to.
There you are.
I was getting worried.
- Do you have the article?
- Almost.
I just have to write it down.
But the deadline is 9 tonight.
If you're not ready, I can always run that profile of our AFS student, Grindl.
No, I have a great headline story.
I'll get it to you by press time.
Well, going against everything that I stand for in gut.
Okay.
I'm working today at the coffeehouse.
I'll have all the time to finish it.
Just my luck.
Everyone in Westbridge must've read the news item: Caffeine makes you live longer.
I either bury this sweater or learn how to knit.
Bury.
What's this?
Sparkly, warm.
Mother of mercy, it's a flake of magic.
One small French Roast, 75 cents.
What are you doing?
You can't just give stuff away.
Oh, he paid for the coffee, I just gave him some free foam.
We've got lots.
Surprisingly, businesses are very touchy about giving stuff away for free.
You could get suspended.
Okay, I really don't do it that often.
No, that's okay.
I'm gonna wait for her.
Salem, there is not a vein of magic running under the house.
It's probably just some leftover magic dust from centuries of spells.
She's right.
Every spring cleaning, I'm covered with enough sparkle to skate with Oksana Baiul.
But go ahead and use your little spark.
Stand back.
I found magic through a legal route Help me get the rest of the loot Jedediah Orenstein, magic prospector at your service.
Yahoo!
Let's go dig for magic.
I would have bet money that he would have conjured up a snow-cone machine.
We're screening The Godfather here tonight.
You coming?
Oh, that is an offer I can't refuse.
Oh, I didn't know you could do Cary Grant.
It starts at 9.
Oh, but my curfew's at 10.
Oh, man, a curfew.
That's cute.
Hey, you know, it's a part of my deal with my parole officer.
Please, just extend it to 11:30?
- You blew the roof off this morning.
- It was a joke.
And we already extended your curfew for the sleigh ride.
Fine.
I'll just watch enough of The Godfather to think it's a feel-good movie.
I know it was a long, long time ago, but were we rebellious teens?
No way.
We were too busy gathering posies to ward off the plague.
You're gonna write your article and do your homework during the movie?
Yeah, how distracting can a Mafia family be?
Nothing but dirt.
You gotta have patience.
I remember back in the magic rush of 1414, it took weeks before I struck it rich.
What happened to all your magic?
Typical story.
Racehorses, showgirls, mahjongg.
Salem, I think we struck.
Ugh!
Argh!
A sewage line.
I should have gotten a snow-cone machine.
Finally, I have brought order to the chaos of Hilda's clock shop.
Found these under my bed.
Oh, great.
More receipts.
And a sock.
Coach was right.
I've never felt more alive since I switched to water.
I haven't even finished a paragraph.
We've been here for two hours.
Maybe some water would help.
Two hours?
It's after 10.
- I'm dead.
- You're dead.
Get home now.
No more excuses.
But Besides breaking curfew, there's another little matter.
QUICK : Hello, this is Mrs. Quick.
I have a message for Sabrina.
Where the blue blazes is your article?
Sorry to disturb you at home.
Well, I have one thing to say about Mrs. Quick: I'm guessing you haven't done your homework.
No, I was going to right after I got home.
I mean, right after I typed up my article.
Sabrina, Hilda is right.
You're dead.
You are grounded for a week.
- But - That means no sleigh ride.
No sleigh ride.
Really?
Oh, come on.
I'm just hurting myself here.
Oh, I'm really starting to hate rules.
No sleigh ride?
Do you really think I like being the disciplinarian?
- Kind of.
- Well, for your information, I would much rather be out singing and dancing.
With William Bennett and George Will.
Can't believe you can't go on the sleigh ride.
I was up half the night.
I was so excited.
No, because you were amped up on sugar.
You'd better be careful, if that stuff wears off, you could crash.
Well, thank you very much.
And the Grindl story came with photos.
Mrs. Quick, wait Loitering and littering.
I swear, this claim is drier than Macon County on a Sunday morning.
Just keep digging, sourdough breath.
You know, I'm getting plumb tired of taking orders from a talking gerbil who's got more fleas than brains.
Says the yokel who hasn't bathed since the McKinley administration.
- Why, you little - You're going down-- Ah!
More sewage.
- It's magic.
- We're rich.
- We've struck magic.
- We're rich.
I'll get you.
Can't go on the sleigh ride, I'm grounded for a week, I screwed up the paper, and my teacher is mad at me.
Excuse me, this is a little bland.
- Could I get an extra shot of vanilla?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Anyway, on the positive side, at least things can't get any worse.
Sabrina, you cannot give away free syrup.
I can't believe I have to say this, but you're suspended.
Take my advice.
Never ever, ever say things can't get worse.
Why, you look gloomier than a one-legged dog at a tap-dance recital.
Well, thanks to everyone's rules, I'm stuck in my room, I've lost my job, and I'm being compared to a crippled canine.
I wanna be in charge of my own life.
Well, it sounds like you need to go to a place where you get to make the rules.
But I'm too old for Chuck E. Cheese and I can't afford my own island.
I know a good place for you to go.
I'm almost positive this isn't my room.
So this is the old coot's idea of an ideal vacation.
I guess he couldn't book me at Club Med Rwanda.
See how they like it when they don't have somebody to enforce the law.
- I swear, the first person I run into-- - Aunt Zelda?
Congratulations.
- You're the new sheriff.
- Ow!
I'm sick of being the boss.
It's up to you now.
Good luck.
With what?
The job or cauterising the wound?
Now I can do what I've always wanted to do.
Rise to the highest position a woman can rise to.
Dance-hall girl.
Call me Frenchy.
Aunt Frenchy?
Howdy, partners.
It's okay, everyone.
Go back to your bridge games.
- Just the sheriff.
- Aunt Hilda?
Miss Hildie.
I own the place.
Welcome to the Wild West.
It looks more like the Sedate West.
Well, we try to live by a few simple guidelines.
Wow, that's a lot of rules.
No water before 10 a.m.?
We only have one bathroom.
Excuse me, who coughed without covering their mouth?
Who broke number 52?
Wait.
You think that no-water rule is tough?
You should see number 143.
No sarsaparilla, ever.
And yet there's no rule against silly hats?
I'm Deputy Fizz.
If there's anything you need for me to do, just Oh, it's my turn for the bathroom.
Can someone please explain to me what's going on here?
Quickdraw's the name, editing is my game.
I know everything there is to know about this town.
Thanks.
You've been a big help.
All you need to know is, it's your job to enforce the rules.
And you make all the rules.
Oh, well, in that case Hey, no standing on chairs.
- Josh?
- Don't know him.
- You could check the bathroom.
- Never mind.
As sheriff, I'm adding a new rule to the list.
Of course you are.
Ten seconds, and the power goes straight to their head.
The new rule is, there are no rules.
How about a song, Frenchy?
Camp town ladies Sing this song Doodah, doodah And sarsaparillas are on the house.
Sheriff, I think I love you.
I think I'm gonna like this place.
Three cheers for the new sheriff.
I love this town and I love all you people.
Trouble's coming.
Trouble's coming.
- What?
- The Petulant Kid.
On the next train.
It's due in one hour.
I guess that's what happens when they cut local taxes.
Well, who is this Petulant Kid?
Why do you keep doing that when I say Petulant Kid?
- Knock it off.
- Hey, the sheriff will handle this.
Anybody wanna go play with matches?
Yeah.
- Wait, wait, what's going on?
- Forget it.
My days of spitting out information on demand are over.
This is your problem now.
Dibs on the lighter fluid.
Problem?
Why is everyone so worried about this kid?
Oh, boy.
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Billy the Kid.
The Sundance Kid.
Hopefully, I'm just jumping to conclusions.
I'll check the wanted posters in the sheriff's office.
Excuse me, miss?
Do you know how many years I have left on my sentence?
Mr. Kraft?
- No, they call me Sweet Will.
- Let me guess.
You run the local schoolhouse and you're locked up for torturing high schoolers.
Oh, no, I blocked an alley with my chuck waggon.
- And?
- And got caught.
You know, I finally get awful Mr. Kraft behind bars and he turns out to be the nicest guy in town.
So everyone says.
Well, blocking an alley with a chuck waggon is up there with giving an extra shot of vanilla.
Yes.
Oh, may your life be filled with happiness.
Oh, maybe they should call you Saccharine Will.
Hey, by any chance, do you know anything about the Petulant--?
Okay, that is getting really annoying.
Lock me up, please.
I'm terrified of the Petulant Kid.
Tell me about this kid or you're a tennis racket.
Five, four-- The biggest, orneriest, no-goodnik this side of the Rio Grande.
The Petulant Kid's goal is to destroy authority, and since you're the authority, well, you can do the math.
But I don't wanna be the authority.
Wait a minute.
There is only one of him and dozens of us.
I'll just get everyone to help.
So I say, one for all and all for one.
Are you with me?
No way.
As he was walking Down the street Down the street, down the street The pretty little maiden He chanced to meet  - Is that the train?
- No.
That's the whistle that tells us the train will be here in 15 minutes.
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
Beg.
Please?
Sorry, I would like to help you, but my feet are killing me from all that dancing.
Oh, why did we get rid of that no-cancanning rule?
Find another sucker.
Since poker-playing became legal again, I lost my saloon.
And I am not leaving this table until I win it back.
Now, the cards with the people on them are the good ones, right?
Sorry, I can't help you.
My shoulder's sore from shooting all those sarsaparillas down the bar.
Only got one good shoulder left.
I understand.
Of course I'll help you, sheriff.
It's my duty.
After all those sugary sodas, I got lots of energy.
Finally.
Thanks.
Train's here.
The Petulant Kid.
Okay.
What am I gonna do?
In the face of danger, I'll just stand up and run.
Giddyup.
Trot.
Amble.
Any forward motion would be fine.
Just you wait.
There's a thing coming called the internal combustion engine.
Oh, boy.
Look out, sheriff.
It's the Petulant Kid.
Okay, people, now is when you dive for cover.
Hey, I hear you're the new authority in town.
Okay, I get it.
I'm the Petulant Kid.
How ironic.
Oh, I'm my own worst enemy.
Can I go home now?
On the count of three, we draw.
Uh-oh.
Not armed.
Duel's off.
- Sheriff, catch.
- Oh, now you decide to be useful.
Oh, a weapon with bad cuticles.
- Dance.
- Me?
No, thanks.
Maybe later.
Or now's good.
This is gonna be fun.
On the count of three.
One, two Three.
I love when they run.
Makes it sporting.
The Petulant Kid is after me.
Where can I hide?
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to say to the kid.
Take her, take her.
Spare me.
Oh, you manage to annoy me in every genre.
Well, that worked out very nicely.
Perfect.
An escape.
I don't believe this.
There should be a law against blocking this alley with a chuck waggon.
This is kind of awkward.
Any last words?
Yeah, I have a couple.
The world needs rules to provide order to protect us from ourselves, or life would be like a lawless, chaotic frontier town.
- Done?
- Yeah.
- I was hoping that would end the spell.
- Wrong.
Dad-blast it.
I'm out of ammo.
Really?
Well, I'm gonna count to three.
That's not her horse, but I'll let it go.
Well, this is no longer a lawless town.
As sheriff, I am reinstating all the rules.
Hey, hey, hey, no spontaneity without written permission.
Okay, maybe not all the rules.
And you were there, and you were there, and you Where the heck were you?
You I could have used.
Sabrina, having you confront your petulant self was our idea.
But we got Jedediah to help us.
He's very good at this particular spell.
Here.
"Prospector, teen rebellion squelcher, mohel"?
You gotta diversify.
Well, I certainly learned my lesson.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to the coffeehouse and try to grovel for my job.
If you don't get it, come home, you're still grounded.
I can't wait for college.
Once again, you have blurred the line between civility and a police state.
Very funny.
Hi, could you scratch my back?
Zelda!
Okay, Jed, now that we've mined all the magic, let's divvy it up.
About that, it's gone.
Gone, as in you're a dead man?
Well, I used all of it on that big old spell for Sabrina.
Sabrina?
My magic went to Sabrina?
Well, that's fair.
I mean, I've already got magic.
No, that's Sabrina.
But I'm a biped.
No, that's Sabrina.
But I can drive.
No, I've done it again.
That's Sabrina.
I know what will make you feel better.
I don't need your pity or your-- Cherry?
My favourite.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Well, since cousin Amanda's visiting for the weekend, I thought I'd get her a little present.
That's a thoughtful gift for all of us.
Now, now, she's family.
We should welcome her with open arms.
If she tries anything, we have an electric cage in the basement.
She's back.
Hi, everybody.
It's so good to see you.
Get your pointer fingers up in the air where I can see them.
Enough, Barney Fife.
Sabrina, I don't blame you for being suspicious.
My behaviour in past may have been a little bratty.
Yeah, you were a little bratty and Nazi Germany was a little aggressive.
But I've grown up.
I'm now a teenage witch, just like you.
I have to admit, she does seem more mature.
Call me irresponsible Okay, there's mature and there's scary.
Unreliable Throw in undependable too - Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock breaks scissors.
You lose.
Finally, for once in my life, you lose.
Fine.
I'll be the one to tell Sabrina that she has to stay with Amanda while we're at work.
I'll get the chips.
You go get CDs.
Got it.
And as per our agreement, since I'm giving Sabrina the bad news, you have to scrub all the pots.
Zelda, you wanna help me dust the clocks?
No, remember, you were going to be in the front minding the store and I was going to be in the back working, alone.
Oh, yeah.
Zelda, I made some tea.
Do you want some?
No, I'm working, alone.
You probably didn't know it was jasmine.
Stop it.
Company.
I'm never gonna get anything done.
Nice bottle.
Oh, look, there's a message.
Probably some shipwrecked soul searching for their lost love.
"Please recycle".
I wish bottles came with a vortex warning.
A genie must have lived here.
Or Luther Vandross.
This place is charming and so private.
I could make this my office.
Let's get out of here.
It smells like stinky genie feet.
Oh, you know what?
I bet we have to flip this switch to get out.
Wow.
Did you use a lot of hairspray this morning?
A little.
Okay, Sabrina, here's your usual, and, Amanda, your Colombian blend, black, just like you ordered.
Thank you, Josh.
Mmm.
My first sip of coffee.
And my last.
Hey, Sabrina.
Oh, hey, you remember my cousin Amanda?
I sure do.
You're such a young lady now.
I remember when you were yay high.
Why am I talking like my uncle Jay?
Dear diary, I had my first cup of coffee and I met Sabrina's boss, Josh.
Is he cute or what?
Give me an exclamation point there.
Mm.
- And then later, Harvey showed up.
Amanda?
- I'll finish later, Miss Sorecorn.
- Yes, ma'am.
And I'll dot the I's with little hearts, as per usual.
- Your mom's on the phone.
- Thanks.
Oh, and by the end of the day, I need a recount on my remaining Red Hots.
Yes, ma'am.
Amanda loves Josh.
I love when the eavesdropping comes to me.
Well, he was being awfully nice to her.
So Amanda has a crush on Josh, huh?
Great reaction.
I thought I'd at least get a girlish squeal out of you.
I know that was sarcastic, but thank you.
Attention, everyone, this is my new office.
And when the lid is on, I am not to be disturbed.
If you get tired of it, you can return it and get a nickel back.
Be careful with that.
You know, it's so inspiring to have a private place to do one's work.
To me, this will be like Hemingway's Key West study.
- But you're not a writer.
- Like Monet's Giverny.
- You're not an artist.
- I just wanna be alone, okay?
You're not Garbo either.
Don't worry about me bothering you.
I'll be antiquing in the 16th century.
Thirteenth-century stuff was much cheaper then.
I just want everyone clear, this bottle is off-limits.
Please tell Amanda.
Speaking of Amanda, it turns out she has a little crush on Josh.
Amanda likes an older man?
That is so cute.
Just like when I had it bad for Sean Connery.
You are several centuries older than Sean Connery.
I know that.
I just like talking about him.
Sabrina, I think it's best not to encourage this crush on Josh.
I know.
That's why we're not going back to the coffeehouse.
Harvey's coming here, Amanda will have to hang out with us and act like a normal teenager.
Amanda needs toner.
I think I'll put you outside so the sun can shine through the glass.
I just love natural light.
Oh, finally.
I can get some work done.
Oh, I just love early-century genie.
Who says you can't find happiness at the bottom of a bottle?
Sealed with a kiss.
Oh, who's the letter for?
Someone you have a crush on?
- No, it's for my mom.
- Oh, really?
Yeah, well, my mom likes Passion Fruity Girl too.
Zellie, I'm back from antiquing.
I didn't find any clocks, but I got a great deal on a plough.
Go away.
What are you doing?
And what's with the outfit?
I specifically told you I did not wanna be disturbed.
- You've got a guy in here, don't you?
- Go away.
Hey, I bet you haven't tried these switches.
- Cool.
- Turn it off.
Oh, I love this song.
Let me do it.
Uh-oh.
Looks like you broke your little bottle.
See you.
The exit switch isn't working.
We're trapped.
And I wanna go play with my new plough.
Right foot, yellow.
Right hand, ow!
Okay, back.
Hello?
Really?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay, Josh is swamped.
I gotta go to work.
Sorry.
- No problem.
- Send Josh my regards.
Of course.
Well, you two just make yourselves comfortable.
Let's play something a little less painful.
How about jousting?
Handy Dandy brush man.
Ooh.
That's a good-looking bottle.
I'll bet these would sell.
A mortal got sucked in.
Even worse, a salesman.
How do we explain this?
Handy Dandy brush man.
Tired of throwing money away on costly combs and brushes?
Yes, it's the comb-brush.
Explain what?
Okay, get ready to tip your cups and empty your bladders.
The brewmaster general is here.
Hello?
Josh?
Sabrina, so good of you to rush down.
Let's forget the charade.
I love you.
Okay, Josh, I knew you kind of liked me, but had no idea your feelings would cause a breakdown.
And an ascot.
Oh, a chocolate soufflÃ©.
You know, you really raised the bar on snack time.
Harvey, this is for you.
Thanks, Amanda.
Hm.
Smells like my mom's bridge club.
Amanda, are you sure this letter is for me?
Of course it is.
I like you, Harvey.
Huh?
Sabrina, you're positively bewitching.
I'm under your spell.
There's a spell going on here, but it's not mine.
Help.
I mean, hello?
Sabrina, Amanda doesn't like Josh.
She likes Harvey.
- Harvey?
- Call me Josh.
Okay, it's all clear now.
Amanda wanted to be alone with Harvey, so she put this spell on Josh.
For the simple days when she could turn me into a doll.
Wait, don't rush off.
There's so much we haven't talked about.
Like kissing.
Don't be afraid to swoon, I'll be here to catch you.
Okay, he's under a cad spell.
I hate to do this.
You cad.
I wasn't just blurting out my true feelings for you, was I?
Oh, were you blurting?
I wasn't paying attention.
Amanda, this is really flattering, but Sabrina and I are sort of going together.
And besides, I'm way too old for you.
I understand, Harvey.
But I like the way you've made your vowels pink and your consonants green.
I guess this really isn't the time or place for us.
But I know what is.
Harvey's all mine on Cloud 9.
Amanda.
Bring my boyfriend back.
You're gonna pay for this.
Well, you really told the ceiling off.
Salem, you have to help me find Harvey.
Well, he's not in the candy dish.
I'm stumped.
Forget it.
I'll just go ask Aunt Hilda.
Oh, she's shopping in another century.
Aunt Zelda will be furious if I try to disturb her in her bottle.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
There's gotta be a spell to find Harvey.
Oh, oh, oh!
Mr. Kotter, I know one.
Can I say the spell and you do the zapping?
- Just hurry.
- Ahem.
Where'd they go, you do the math Help me follow Harvey's path That was fun.
Meet Sherlock Bones.
If he can't find him, nobody can.
Sherlock, okay, Harvey was last seen-- He's a dog.
He can't talk.
Just give him something of Harvey's so he can pick up the scent.
Hey, here's Harvey's jacket.
Here.
Maybe this will help you track his trail!
Oh, no.
Storage?
He's in here?
Oh, did Amanda stuff him in a box?
No wonder genies have to turn into smoke to get out of these.
This seal is really tight.
Zellie, try this brush.
It makes your hair smell like grape.
Don't worry, someone's gonna come along and get us out of here.
I don't want to get us out of here, I want to get you out of here.
Cool hideout.
You've obviously got bucks.
How many boxes of brittle can we sign you up for?
I just want to be alone.
What kind of brittle?
They're here?
Cloud 9?
Hey, where are you--?
Oh, yeah, you're all work until you see a squirrel.
Why would Amanda bring Harvey here?
So you really like being with me, don't you, Harvey?
Well, I'm on Cloud 9.
I like everything on Cloud 9.
Why, you little home wrecker.
Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
I can't believe you tried to steal my boyfriend.
He's not your boyfriend anymore.
- He's mine.
- No, he's mine.
He's mine.
Wow.
I'm flying.
You broke my boyfriend.
I didn't break your boyfriend.
I broke my boyfriend.
- Thank you for saving my boyfriend.
- For the last time, he's my-- You know what?
I give up, Harvey's yours.
That means you're gonna have to sign some release forms.
Today a medical release form, tomorrow a marriage licence.
Be sure to let me know where you're registered.
When I ask for a wheelchair, everyone says no.
I gotta get Harvey out of harm's way.
Put Harvey in his own bed With none of these happenings In his head Weird.
I haven't taken a nap in years.
And I've got cloud in my hair.
I've gotta find a way to stop Amanda's infatuation with Harvey.
So we're just not gonna talk about my wheelchair?
I'll get you, Sabrina, and your little kitty too.
I'm burning mad.
Well, the queen of property damage has arrived.
Where did you hide my Harvey?
You can have Harvey.
Just don't hurt me.
What Salem's trying to say is, why don't we be mature about this and discuss it rationally?
I'll tear this room apart until I find him.
Interesting take on rational.
Freeze.
Talk about your cool cat.
Sorry.
I should do some early Christmas shopping.
Can't you people call during dinner like everyone else?
Hilda, it's Dreama.
She can zap us out.
Are we talking about the same Dreama?
We're desperate.
Dreama, zap us out.
- But don't open the lid.
- What did you say?
Zelda, get your hands off of her throat.
I've lost all feeling in my tail.
I've gotta stop Amanda's infatuation before she finds Harvey.
There's nothing under crush, puppy love, or psychotic preteen lacking scruples or any sense of morality.
Wagging that appendage was my only creative outlet.
- Oh, what will I do?
- Help me find a spell.
Look under "desire".
Oh!
You're back.
Whip it, tiger.
Here's something.
Hopefully this will help kill Amanda's desire.
Hey, Sabrina!
Hey, Sabrina!
Stanley Kinkle-ski?
Don't ever leave me, baby.
Maybe I should have read the fine print on that desire spell.
Sabrina, it looks like you did a Streetcar Named Desire spell.
Thank you.
No one's made me dinner.
I have to eat before I go bowling.
Yeah, well, the spell certainly killed desire, mine.
How did I tear my T-shirt?
Why did I dream I was playing poker with Karl Malden?
Oh, dang, I miss Stanley.
Where's Harvey?
I've looked everywhere, even Iowa.
You looked in the Midwest and you didn't even check his bedroom?
- Salem.
- Thanks for the tip.
A concrete solution.
This might be a good time to throw her in the river.
You're stepping on my foot.
Excuse me.
I feel like I'm in a bejewelled anthill.
Hilda, why did you have to come in here?
Why couldn't you just leave me alone?
I was excited about the plough I bought.
That's not true.
And it could have waited until later.
Well, this is a conundrum, isn't it?
And why is it that our entire lives, whenever I tried to find solitude in my own room, tree house, pod, there you were?
Why is that?
Well, the only thing I can think of is that, a lot of the time there's just the two of us, so that if you're alone, that means I'm alone.
And when I'm alone, I get lonely.
Hilda, we've had a breakthrough.
I understand you now.
I want to be alone, but you have every right not to be alone.
Do me a favour, get a dog.
That's a great idea.
We'll go to the pound together.
I have to do something before Amanda pulls an Incredible Hulk on that cement.
I know I'm not supposed to disturb Aunt Zelda but--  The monster's on the move.
Go ahead, you big tattletale.
I guess you're not mature enough to handle this one on your own.
I don't need any help.
I can solve this one all by myself.
Salem, what do I do?
Well, hiring a hit man is prohibitively expensive.
So I guess you could just wait for her to outgrow this crush on Harvey.
Why wait when one is a witch?
I can use magic to make her grow up.
So now that you've blossomed, are you any older and wiser?
I sure am.
Wise enough to know I wanna stay a kid as long as I can.
- Wonderful.
- Since I'm a kid, I don't need boyfriend.
Perfect.
I have finally done a spell that turned out the way it should.
And in the sprit of staying young, I'm gonna cut your hair.
See, perfect spell.
I needed a new haircut.
Aunt Zelda.
Aunt Zelda.
Am I the only one who thinks we're running out of air?
Sabrina's our only hope.
Amanda's our only hope.
I'm going home.
Like I said, Salem's our only hope.
Oh, nothing like a little catnap.
Hey, where is everybody?
I'm hungry.
Zelda, feed me.
I will not be ignored.
Well, Aunt Zelda, I'm really sorry about your bottle, but I think there's an empty can in trash.
Yeah, too bad Salem ruined your secret hideaway.
Well, that is the one good thing about being a witch.
Everyone, stay out of my tree house.
Tree house?
Well, it's getting late.
I'll walk you to your door.
I had a really great time tonight.
Me too.
When I'm with you, Sabrina, I'm on Cloud 9.
Harvey, I have to tell you.
I'm sorry, but I'm breaking up with you.
It's for the best.
Sabrina, do you ever black out and miss big parts of the day?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Me, me, me.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda.
Hey, why do you always put the bills in my pile?
You're the one who insists we have heat and running water.
- Zelda.
- Any mail for me?
Sorry, honey, not today.
Why is it taking so long to hear back from the schools I applied to?
I mean, I got accepted to the Columbia Record Club in two days.
- Maybe this will help.
- Oh, great.
A lower rate for the mortgage I don't have.
Thanks.
The Other Realm University.
Do you think I got in?
Oh, no, it's thin.
Acceptance letters are always thick.
Open it.
I got in!
I got in!
To my alma mater.
Oh, honey, I'm so proud.
Oh, your first acceptance elephant.
I'm not a peanut, tubbo.
Work couple hours.
Home for dinner.
Oh, Sabrina, wait.
Willard, I'm sure the school board will renew your contract.
In the meantime, try squeezing that little rubber ball the doctor gave you.
I got you something.
"Oru"?
Oh, great.
Because my "obu" T-shirt just tore.
It's from the Other Realm University.
Come on, put it on.
There.
Oh, just seeing you in that makes me so happy.
Yeah, and, you know, the extra layer will come in handy in case there's a rogue May blizzard.
But it hardly ever bites.
Dreama, no.
It's a mortal prom.
Wearing a live fox fur could spread infection.
O.R.U. Oral Roberts?
Please say no.
No, I got into my aunt's alma mater.
Octagon Rectangle University.
It's got a great geometry programme.
But you've gotta go to Emerson.
I was counting on it.
Well, there's the little matter of getting in.
Hey, we can check the Emerson website right now - and see if you got accepted.
- Oh, no, no, I can't look.
Ready?
You're in!
- Yes.
- Hey, it's like winning the lottery, - but I'm still poor.
- And I got you a little something.
Wow, a sweatshirt.
And it's machine washable.
My life is perfect.
So how does it feel?
Hot and lumpy.
So is the food in the cafeteria.
It's a sign.
You're going to Emerson.
Harvey, what are you doing here?
I got a letter from Boston College.
And I checked your mailbox.
You got one too.
That's a felony, but thanks.
- You wanna open them together?
- Desperately.
Why are you wearing an Emerson sweatshirt?
To go with my Lake and Palmer sweat socks.
Okay, on the count of three.
One, two, three.
- I'm in!
- I'm in!
- You're in?
- You're in?
- We're in!
- We're in!
You know what?
I got us these just in case.
Oh, I assumed we'd put off dressing alike till we were in our mid 50s, driving around Vegas in our motor home, but Looks great.
Look out, Boston College.
I hope my aunts don't mind paying three tuitions.
Ow!
You know, I always say, when the knife breaks, it's done.
If the government is going to give away meat, you'd think they could make it a little more tender.
Hey, keep it down.
He meant gesundheit.
Monkey.
I know you're upset about the school board, but why don't you just call them and find out what's going on?
I did, 417 times.
And at 10 cents a minute, that gets expensive.
I'm sorry.
Gosh.
You know, a person does a good job and he's rewarded by being dehumanised and beaten into submission.
And I was in favour of all that.
Till it happened to me.
Oh, honey, I'm on your side.
Day or night, your Zoo Zoo will always return your calls.
Well, great.
And all your supportive blather has made me burn my free meat.
I feel like I'm being pulled in three directions by three people I care about.
- What do you think I should do?
- Hike.
We're not allowed to play football in the house.
No, hike.
Backpack.
Spend a year tramping across the galaxy.
Instead of going to college?
Isn't that irresponsible?
It's what I did after high school.
And by irresponsible, I mean fun and life-enriching.
See?
Problem solved.
My filthy laundry will look great in there.
Oh, we are going to have so much fun planning your trek.
And don't let anyone tell you to take the long way to the twin peaks of Mars.
Unless you enjoy bleeding gums.
Okay, now I have four people to disappoint.
Maybe this isn't the best time to tell you, but you got into John Adams College.
Wow!
Oh, I can't even think about Adams.
But I really want you to go there.
- What?
- Just messing with you.
You know I always wanted you to be a Green Beret.
Where have you been?
It's 5:30 in the morning.
I need to talk about the school board.
Monkey, we talked, for hours.
We even took our phones to bed in case you needed to talk some more.
And you did.
Now I need to sleep.
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
- You don't love me.
- What?
We talked until 2 a.m. I made you soup.
I held your hand and your used tissues.
What are you doing for me now?
You know, Willard, it's late.
We're tired.
Let's not say things we mean.
Not talk to each other for a couple of days.
What?
You're breaking up with me?
No, I just think we need a cooling-off period.
Which is female code for breaking up.
You really should go.
So we're not gonna talk?
You forgot your--  Hilda?
Don't worry, I'm fine.
Just a little fender-bender.
Oh, I got bagels.
Hey!
Stevie Wonder, drive much?
I was pulling into my driveway and you backed into me.
By pulling in, I assume you mean speeding at 70 miles an hour.
No, but let's go back out and do it that way.
I hate your boyfriend.
Now, let's all calm down.
The insurance companies will sort it out.
No way.
I'm not taking a rate hike just because you live with Speed Racer here.
- I am suing.
- Oh, that's it.
Willard, get out.
- Are you throwing me out?
- Yes.
- You're throwing me out?
- Yes.
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't stay here under those conditions.
I am so mad.
Oh, don't be.
He doesn't have a case.
Not that.
I forgot the schmeer.
Emerson, Boston College, Other Realm University, backpacking.
Salem, how do you make a decision?
You've come to the right man.
When I was a military leader, I made life and death decisions every day and one method never failed me.
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.
You are a wretched excuse - for a sounding board.
- Whatever.
Sorry.
I've been awake since 5:30 this morning, having gone to bed at 5:15.
Sabrina, you're looking at The Magic of Physics.
Oh, you'll love that course.
Oh, well, it just sort of fell open.
And the professor, what a wild-looking creature.
Griffin, I believe.
We'll check the yearbook.
Oh, good, I get to feel bad and look at old yearbooks.
Good morning.
Guess what.
I just found out that B.C. has their own Sports Broadcasting Department.
Hey, another reason I should go.
Wanna drive to their football stadium and pretend to announce a game?
I'd love to, but  apparently, we have company.
Spellman sees daylight as she heads for the door.
Road trip, Cape Cod.
My frat's having a clambake.
You have to come.
- But tonight's the prom and--  Sabrina, good news.
Apparently, I have an aunt in distress, so we'll talk later, okay?
VoilÃ , lookie, lookie.
I got you a Uranus rail pass.
Should that be a good thing?
I'm gonna go find you my old map of Alpha Centauri.
Sabrina.
Sabrina, it's not until tomorrow.
Sabrina, I found it.
Sabrina, good news.
Are you ready?
Sabrina?
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Oh, why can't I please all the people I care about?
Different.
Either I just saw four Sabrinas or that can of stewed meat was way past its expiration date.
So I've made my decision.
I'm gonna go to Boston College.
Oh, that's fantastic.
- What made up your mind?
- I wanna make you happy.
Well, right now, I am chock-full of happy.
You're going backpacking.
You'll be just like Jack Kerouac, only sober.
I just wanna make you happy, Aunt Hilda.
Oh, you are going to love Emerson.
Sabrina, I am so happy that you're going to O.R.U. And as one scholar to another, let me just say, yippee.
Oh, man, I haven't done that much running since the time I pretended I was in a Benny Hill sketch.
This must be it.
Decisions, decisions.
Sabrina's indecisiveness and need to please everyone has caused her to be torn apart.
Literally.
I gotta do something.
I gotta warn her.
Or her or ju-- Ooh.
A spell for shiny, manageable hair.
Hey, hello, future fellow lion.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Isn't your prom tonight?
Oh, my, I have been so overwhelmed with thinking about going to your school that I completely forgot about it.
Wait a second.
Did something happen between you and Harvey?
I mean, don't let going to Emerson hurt your relationship.
You know, this prom is something special-- - Like to go to the prom with me?
- Absolutely.
You like gardenias?
Watch it.
For Boston, for Boston!
For thee and thine alone!
Let me guess, Sabrina's decided to go to Boston College.
Yeah, B.C.'s got everything I want.
Good classes, fun and most importantly, Fridays is eat-your-own-weight-in-noodles day.
Boolah.
Boolah, boolah.
Come on, Harv, let's go grab some guys and throw the ball.
Are you kidding?
Hi, tonight's the prom.
The culmination of our entire high school experience.
Harvey and I have a lot to do.
I should take a shower.
- Ciao.
- Later, Sabrina.
Sabrina?
Now, normally, we'd need a subatomic particle accelerator to fuse the molecules.
But with a pinch of magic and a sprinkle of cardamom VoilÃ , we can create a new element in the privacy of our own home.
Naturally, I'm taking Intro to Magical Chemistry.
Oh, dear, I've monopolised your whole day.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for the prom?
But what about you?
Aren't you gonna chaperone with Mr. Kraft?
Well, I You see, Willard and I stopped seeing each other.
Please don't cheer.
Aunt Zelda, I'm so sorry.
No matter what my personal feelings are for him, I know how much you cared about him and somehow managed to love him.
I did.
And that's why I think you should go to the prom and remind him what a smart, funny, attractive woman you are, and leave him regretting the day he was born.
What a wonderful idea.
There's no reason I can't go and make him miserable.
Oh, but can't we just do one more experiment?
Oh, Sabrina, I've waited my whole life to hear you say that.
What you doing?
I decided that pack is way too small for all the things that you're gonna need.
That's why I got you this.
A Sherpa and a yak?
Well, I hear they're great company, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the Sherpa too.
Wanna come with me backpacking?
This is one of those rites of passage that you absolutely have to experience alone.
Well, do you wanna come to my prom with me tonight?
- Sure.
- Hey, we can set off the sprinklers during the slow dance.
Oh, I always knew you liked me best.
I just can't shake this nagging feeling that there's something I'm supposed to tell Hilda and Zelda.
Aunt Hilda, I'm running a little late.
Me too.
Oh, I forgot the blow-dryer.
If Josh calls, tell him I'm on my way.
Okay.
Another 20 minutes.
Make it 30.
That Other Realm beauty parlour was a great idea.
I think I got all the mud out.
Well, there's no reason a woman can't discover cold fusion and look like her Internet start-up just went public.
I'll be right down, Harvey.
I think I left my earrings in the bathroom.
Wait.
Now I remember.
Nope.
Thought I had it there for a minute.
- Oh, this is so lovely.
- Oh, this is so lovely.
Where's Harvey?
I thought he'd pick you up.
Oh, but I wanted to come with you.
- Is that Mr. Kraft?
- It sure is.
I'd recognise that spray-on hair anywhere.
- He's looking.
- All right, just walk slowly.
- Think we lost him?
- Yeah.
That security guard had no sense of humour.
- Confiscating our pig's blood?
- I know.
I swear, sometimes I think I'm the only one who thought Carrie was a comedy.
Doesn't Westbridge throw a great prom?
Go Westbridge.
It's nice to finally get to slow dance with you without a scoreboard in the background.
- What would you like to drink?
- Oh, I want what you want.
Don't feel bad, Aunt Zelda.
I mean, in this light, Mr. Kraft and the lunch lady do look a lot alike.
How'd you get here so fast?
I've been cooling my Guccis here for about ten minutes.
That a different dress?
Than I had on yesterday.
Oh, delightful.
Thank you.
Hope that wasn't awkward with Harvey.
Why, is there spinach in my teeth?
Oh, is that one mine?
Thanks.
What did you do with--?
Your dress!
I have been waiting for you to compliment it all night.
Oh, this is the best song.
Was it about money?
No.
My vacation plans?
No.
I've really gotta start writing things down.
Hey, Alcerro.
Ta.
Harvey.
- Ah!
Sabrina.
- Hi, Brad.
On, excuse me.
I forgot something.
I am all over the place today.
I don't know what hurts worse, my hands or my arm pits.
Willard.
Look at you, you look fan-- Ahem.
I mean, how are you?
Fine.
What in the world happened to you?
What do you think happened to me?
Your sister's malicious and premeditated assault on me and my property, and I'm going to take her for all she's worth.
- Nothing personal.
- Okay.
Continuing in the vein of things not to be taken personally, I am breaking up with you, you duplicitous little worm.
Again, nothing personal.
Hey, have you seen Sabrina?
We were making fun of people and I would hate for her to miss this opportunity.
What are you doing here?
Well, actually, I'm looking for Sabrina.
- Why?
- She's my date.
Does anyone have any lipstick I could borrow?
I forgot mine.
- Oh, sure, I always bring ex-- - Uh-oh.
What--?
It was something big.
So you think you're here with Sabrina?
No, I know I'm here with Sabrina.
Hey, look, man.
I know you've had a thing for her all year, and I hate to use this kind of language, but you're crossing over a line.
But Sabrina came with me so we could make Willard jealous and miserable.
I'm right here.
SABRINA 1: There must be a logical explanation for this.
SABRINA 2: I don't know what's going on.
I'm the real Sabrina.
SABRINA 3: Wrong, I'm Sabrina.
- Sabrina?
SABRINAS : Do you mind?
Interesting spell.
Get this straight, coffee boy.
Sabrina is my girl, and this obsession that you have with her has got to stop.
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna leave you here looking like a fool.
Far be it for me to be the conscience of the group, but it seems to me that none of you are doing what you want.
Are you?
No.
I'm only going to the Other Realm U to make Aunt Zelda happy.
Harvey.
Josh.
Well, it seems the question is what does Sabrina wanna do?
No, you're wrong.
Sabrina and I came together and immediately started making fun of, well, whoever we saw.
Sabrina and I drove here together.
I haven't seen your niece and it's been the only positive part of this whole evening.
Hey, man, do you think I'd really come to a high school dance by myself?
Miss Spellman, would you please tell this guy that Sabrina came with me?
She's a popular little miscreant.
If she likes you so much, how come she's going to Emerson?
So she can be with you and all your other imaginary friends?
She's going to Boston College.
Wrong.
She's going backpacking.
Hilda, I sense a spell afoot.
You're right.
She's going backpacking.
You know, Zelda, I am glad that we broke up.
No more ridiculous conversations about Sabrina Spellman.
Excuse me, there are teen spirits here that need to be squashed.
So we're all agreed?
We do what's best for Sabrina?
- Agreed.
- Molto agreed.
I'm not sure.
Kidding.
Don't gang up on yourself.
Well, I hope the four of me didn't cause any trouble.
Marquis of Queensbury, boys.
There's Sabrina.
Sabrina, by any chance, has some magic gone awry?
Let's see, it's one of the biggest nights of my high school life.
Of course some magic has gone awry.
Sabrina, will you set Josh straight and tell him you didn't invite him to the prom?
- But I did invite him to the prom.
See?
Did this conversation just take a frightening turn?
No, I invited Josh to the prom because I wanted you all here to make a formal announcement.
So now that we're all wearing formals, here goes.
I don't know how you're all gonna take this, but the school I really wanna go to is Adams.
That's a great choice.
Sure.
- You're not mad?
- We're fine with wherever you want.
Yeah.
We just want you to be happy.
Did you think otherwise?
Me?
No.
So are you upset that you broke up with Willard?
No.
I'm calm and eager for revenge.
Let's get Willard and his beaten-up Cordoba.
Cool dÃ©jÃ  vu.
I had the same conversation after my prom, except it was about Brutus and his beaten-up chariot.
I just remembered something really important I need to tell you.
I think you're a little late.
The cable guy called yesterday and said he can't come out until next Tuesday.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
A hot pot.
I love it.
I can just see myself at Adams, boiling water.
You know what would make a really great graduation gift?
A Mr. Microphone.
Yeah, if you've gotten every other gift in the world.
Hey, the toaster.
I bet it's a present from the Other Realm.
It's stuck.
Probably snagged on my cheese toast.
You're not supposed to melt stuff in our delicate Other Realm communication system.
It's just a bagel and a little cheese.
Okay, a bagel and a wheel of cheese.
Same difference.
Okay, the towels are changed, the soap dispensers are filled, and the urinal cakes are replaced.
This is how I keep people from knowing I like you best.
Including me.
Well, Skippy.
Come to spend some of that hard-earned paper-route money?
Tough talk for a college junior who still attends high school proms.
Harvey, can't you guys be nice?
- No.
He likes you, Sabrina.
- Right, we're friends.
But he's hoping for girlfriend.
I don't like you spending time with him.
And I bet if the shoe were on the other foot-- Hey, I have never once been jealous of you and Josh.
Sabrina, I don't ask for much.
Quit this job, please?
Do it for me.
Harvey, that's not fair.
I like Josh, and nothing is going on.
And I need this job.
- That was an awfully long no.
- Harvey.
Great, a fight with my boyfriend and I smell like Comet.
You know, you're like the evil version of the Maytag Repairman.
What?
I needed the calcium.
Zellie, have you decided what you're gonna get Sabrina for graduation?
Oh, I haven't had time to think about it.
I've been too busy handling this lawsuit Willard has filed against you for hitting his car.
- Oh, yeah, that.
- Yeah, that.
Speaking of that, have you seen a notarised witness statement?
It's pink.
Found it.
Who's in trouble now?
Harvey's being unreasonable.
I don't know why he doesn't want me hanging out with Josh.
- He must not trust me.
- That is so sad.
I think there's only one thing you can do.
Open another present.
Is it a Mr. Microphone?
Is it a Mr. Microphone?
No, it's luggage.
- Oh, come right in.
- Is Zelda here?
No, she's out at a meeting getting her seven-day free-of-Willard chip.
Well, my car is fixed.
It actually goes in reverse now.
So I want to inform you that I am dropping the lawsuit.
Isn't it too bad they haven't invented the telephone yet?
- Will you please give these to Zelda?
- Will do.
I've just hit Willard.
I am so suing.
You know, I've always liked this place.
It'll be fun owning it.
I didn't hit you hard.
What was he doing here?
Oh, he came by to drop some lawsuit.
You know, I have no problem at all with Harvey and Josh being friends.
Were your friends operating under a price limit - when they got you all these things?
- Hey, I found something.
"If two enemies break bread together, they will no longer be enemies".
I'm gonna bake some friendship bread.
Here's my gift.
A magic mirror.
Oh, yeah.
You can't get this kind of plastic just anywhere.
It's not what it looks like.
It's what it does.
Mirror, mirror, near the wall Who's the best gift-giver of them all?
You wrote the cheque, so I guess it's you, Chickie B. - Case closed.
- Chickie B?
Mm-hm.
I don't get it, Kinkle.
If you can't stand this guy Josh, why do you keep coming back here?
I gotta keep my eye on Mr. I-Can't-Find-a-Girl-My-Own-Age.
Don't worry, I plan to keep a really low profile.
- Oh, hey, have you seen Sabrina?
- Keep away from my girlfriend.
I'll stay away from Sabrina when she tells me to.
Maybe she did tell you to but you're starting to forget things, Grandpa.
Hey, look, fresh-baked bread from my ever-loving oven.
- I'm game.
- Maybe you should leave.
- Maybe you should make me.
- It's got raisins.
Oh, raisins.
Really-- Hey, I'm on break now.
Let's have a cup of coffee together.
Only if I'm buying.
Look at them.
This bread could have kept The Beatles together.
Admit it.
I got Sabrina the best gift.
I don't know how you can compare a specially brewed homemade scent with a snotty-talking looking glass.
I know, you can't.
Mine's clearly better.
- Salem.
- Oopsy.
You did that on purpose.
I think the "oopsy" implies that I didn't.
Oh, I see your vile little plan.
You break our gifts with the childish hope that we will then buy Sabrina a Mr. Microphone.
Yeah, it's so obvious.
A mister what?
I have no such plan.
Did it work?
Oh, you are in for it, buster.
Not only did you break irreplaceable items, but you've now freed the man in the mirror.
This decor is really the fairest of them all.
If you're talking county fairs.
Argh.
First the toaster and now this mess.
I don't know when I've been so angry with you.
- You are in a peck of trouble.
- Define "peck".
- Allow me.
- No, please, allow me.
- Oh, I insist.
- No, I insist.
- You first.
- No, no, you first.
Oh, just sit down.
Well, it's nice to see them getting along for a change.
It's like Chip and Dale.
Only I'm not enjoying it.
- So how you guys doing?
- Great.
We just found out we both share a love of turkey jerky.
I'm sorry, did you wanna answer that?
No, no, your answer was just perfect.
This is going great.
Have you thought of anything else to get Sabrina?
Maybe I have and maybe I haven't.
You know, Hilda, I think we're getting into a bad area here, competing through presents.
I had that thought first.
You know, maybe we're focused on the presents because we don't wanna focus on the reality.
Sabrina's leaving for college.
Yeah, next year it'll just be the two of us.
Did she say "just the two of us"?
Yeah, it'll be strange to have just two.
Well, on the plus side, fewer groceries to buy.
Fewer groceries?
Only the two?
Dear Lord, they're getting rid of the cat.
Oh, well, right now we have other things to deal with.
Are you painting your head?
Oh, it's murder on my pillow, but the ladies love it.
Harvey, there's a Die Hard marathon playing at the Student Union.
- I like Die Hard.
- Excellent, we'll stock up on jerky - and sit in the front row.
- I prefer Skittles.
- You're on.
- Hey, remember me?
Oh, yeah, Sabrina.
She can cover for you.
- Let's go.
- That does it.
This friendship is cloying That's a fact Bring up the bread With the magic ipecac See, I told you that raw chicken is not a delicacy.
Get ahold of yourself, Saberhagen.
Think.
There must be some mistake.
They love you.
Okay, they can stand you.
Wait a minute, they have to keep me.
The Witches' Council won't let them get rid of me.
Oh, thank heavens for bureaucracy.
Well, we have to find him someplace to stay, don't we?
No, I talked to the Witches' Council, and according to them, technically, he's a freeloader.
So we can throw him out on the streets for all they care.
Not the streets, there's scary stuff on the streets.
I say we toss him out and let him fend for himself.
I'm a dead man.
Let's at least get him a room at the Y. Isn't there anything in this house to drink?
A small room.
Hey, so you two threw up together.
Isn't that some sort of male-bonding thing?
Only in a prison movie.
You guys still feel close, right?
I never would have been sick if I hadn't eaten food from this E. coli farm.
What?
Ignore him, he's just a little testy.
You know, he's at his worst post-vomit.
I'm not putting up with your insults anymore.
Someone else is testy.
That's something you two have in common.
You are hereby banned from this place.
Sabrina, if you keep working for this guy, we're through.
- Harvey.
- Good riddance.
Josh.
Okay, as usual, my plan is going perfectly.
Why am I so reluctant to quit the coffeehouse?
It's not the free day-old muffins.
What is the true meaning behind this?
You still like Josh, you bonehead.
Now, help me.
I'm being evicted.
I do like Josh.
I mean, I couldn't imagine not seeing him every day.
But I can't imagine life without Harvey either.
And I can't imagine life without fluffy pillows and a shower massage.
Get out, you little narcissist.
You just mean, out of your room, not the house, right?
Maybe Sabrina's right.
There is a chance, however slim, that my ironic and detached nature could be misconstrued as jerkiness.
Well, I'll just act nice, and then the aunts won't give me the heave-ho.
How hard could it be?
Say, have you been getting sleep?
You look a lot less yellow than usual.
Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
No one's good at anything the first time.
Ah!
I need help.
Oh, a boyfriend course.
Sounds promising.
Besides, I'm desperate.
- Having trouble picking a boyfriend?
- Exactly.
Then you need the boyfriend course.
Sign up here.
This is the boyfriend course.
Oh, I get it.
An obstacle course.
Clever.
I never get enough of those Other Realm puns.
And here are the boyfriends.
- Where are we?
- Oh, this is just some weird dream.
Eleanor Roosevelt's not gonna appear and start hitting me with a leg of lamb, is she?
No, it's a different weird dream.
Don't worry, they're under a spell.
They'll never remember a thing.
Go.
- Okay, just one questions, Mr. Chips.
- Yeah?
How is this gonna help me decide on the right boyfriend?
Oh, that's easy.
You choose the one that isn't dead.
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.
What?
So we're agreed.
Instead of competing, we'll come up with a present for Sabrina that we both like, and go in on it together.
Perfect.
I bet my gift ideas are better than yours.
- Sorry.
- I hate to interrupt conversations of genius, but may I say, you two vexing beauties are radiating brilliance.
Salem, you're still gonna be punished.
Don't try buttering us up.
Don't be ridiculous.
Everyone knows butter only belongs on lovely finger sandwiches.
Follow me.
- High tea from me to thee.
- Oh, my.
Oh, don't we have a fine time, the three of us?
Go, Harvey.
Go, Josh.
Go, team.
It's sweet of you to root for both of them.
That way, you don't have to feel guilty at the loser's funeral.
No offence, zebra boy, but these are young guys.
Unless one of your obstacles is a piece of delectable-looking cake laced with anthrax, - this course is not gonna kill them.
- Don't worry.
Sudden death will.
Okay, I appear to be standing in some sort of primordial ooze - in my good shoes.
What is this stuff?
- Quicksand.
Ah!
It wouldn't be sporting if you had magic.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I'd like to drop this course.
Whoever saves you, gets you.
I know that sounds a little bit sexist, but this hasn't been updated since 1672.
Just relax.
You relax.
One sudden move and I'm chugging a sand smoothie.
Help, Harvey.
Josh.
Have no fear, Sabrina.
I'm on my way.
Hey, Dudley Do-Right called.
He wants his dialogue back.
Sabrina, I'll be right there.
Okay, that might hold them up.
Is there anything more delightful than a perfect cup of Darjeeling served in bone china?
Not to mention the civility of corn relish on toast points.
How marvellous.
And I did it all myself.
What the?
Salem.
Well-dressed robbers.
Call the police.
Okay, which one of you two left the backdoor open?
I hope everything was to your liking.
And, yes, we accept all major credit cards.
My heavens, were those pastries spun from gold?
I just wanted you to have the best.
Maybe I didn't think this through.
You're pretty.
Hang on, Sabrina.
I'll save you.
- Stay calm, Sabrina.
I'll save you.
- Why shouldn't I be calm?
Some people pay thousands of dollars for this kind of beauty treatment.
Help!
Hey, maybe I can stop the blades with this.
Give me that.
Okay, all extremities intact.
Run, Harvey Kinkle, run!
Well, I think we have truly found the perfect graduation present.
A car.
I know in our hearts that Sabrina loves us for who we are, but this is really gonna cinch it.
Let's put the keys in a little box, and then put that box in a bigger box, and then put that box-- Now I've lost my train of thought.
Oh, Willard.
Glad to see you up and about.
I assume you're here to serve papers.
No, I'm dropping the lawsuit.
I Zelda, we've been through too much together to have it end this way.
And my lawyer took my retainer and went to Tonga.
- Oh, thank you, Willard.
- No, no, no.
My emotions and my spine are both a little raw.
- So - So  Okay.
Oh, now I remember.
In a bigger box, and then that box--  Not again.
How did he manage to walk into all those trash cans?
Apparently, there doesn't seem to be a bottom to this bottomless pit.
Hurry.
Hang on, Sabrina, I'm almost-- About to face my not-so-irrational childhood fear of snakes.
Out of my-- Snakes!
I'm sure they're a lot more afraid of you than you are of them.
Hey, look, there's a plank we can use as a bridge.
Sucker.
What we do for love.
Figures.
Four years warming the bench in football, now I find out I should have gone out for track.
If I don't convince the aunties soon that I've really turned over a new leaf, I'm gonna be tossed out into the cold on my nicely rounded buttocks.
Maybe I've been too subtle.
Blessings to all who enter here.
You are still in deep doody, mister.
After much thought, we've come up with your punishment.
Now, I want you to know that its severity is only to teach you a lesson.
- You're grounded until further notice.
- Grounded?
- You mean, I can't leave the house?
- That's right.
You realise we're punishing ourselves as well, but what can we do?
I'm glad we read the Marilu Henner book.
Oh, sweet relief.
I've still got a home.
And best of all, I like being a nice guy.
This new leaf is staying turned because I'm a changed cat.
Car keys?
Hardcastle and McCormick, eat your heart out.
Somebody save me!
Or at least scratch my nose.
Don't worry, Sabrina.
I'll have you out of that quicksand within seconds.
But if you have a crossword puzzle handy, you might wanna break it out.
- Hurry!
- Sabrina, I'm coming.
- I'll block the flames with this rock.
- Hey, I'm gonna save Sabrina.
Guys, I don't know if I've mentioned in casual conversation in the past, but I don't wanna die.
I don't care who saves Sabrina as long as Sabrina gets saved.
- You're right.
- All right, help me push this thing.
Okay, I guess it's time to come up with a few last words.
Let's see Dying is easy, comedy is hard.
No.
Rosebud.
No.
'Tis a far better thing-- Darn, all the good last words have already been done.
- We did it.
- All right.
- Wow, you must work out.
- You know, I've been benching-- - Guys, this stuff ain't slowsand.
- Sabrina.
Whee!
Do you know why I do this?
Kicks, man.
Kicks.
I'll get a Hungry-Man dinner.
Watch a little of the Antiques Roadshow, and-- Holy mother of pearl!
I'm okay.
I am suing you-- A cat?
Just one question, what was the point of all this?
The point was for one of them to die.
We've never had both contestants survive before.
Well, good luck picking one of these brave boys.
The worst part, other than the pound of quicksand in my underwear, is I don't know what to do about Harvey and Josh.
I'll look it up, but I'm almost certain there's a tribe in New Guinea where women can have multiple husbands.
Honey, I'm sorry you have such a dilemma to face.
I wish we could comfort you with your graduation present.
I bet now you're kicking yourself for not getting her that Mr. Microphone.
- The toaster's fixed.
- And now I can toast my sticky bun.
Me no funny?
It's a notice from the Witches' Council.
"This is to inform you that the friendship spell has caused the mortal Harvey Kinkle to reach his spell quota".
That means, after the friendship bread, no more spells would affect him.
But what about the obstacle course?
That means, he dove under blades, jumped over snake pits, and fought fire on his own?
I'm beginning to think he likes me.
Yeah, he's brave, but how are you gonna explain this to him?
Oh, you know Harvey.
He bought my "you're just dreaming" explanation per usual.
Sabrina, could we talk about the fact that you're a witch?
I know I'm in the doghouse, but this is ridiculous.
Hello?
I don't think I deserve this kind of treatment.
It was just a car.
We really don't like that man.
I said I was sorry.
Well, if I didn't, I meant to.
Oh, there's no lock on this door.
In fact, there's no door.
And I'm out of pepper spray.
You'll feel bad when I'm dead.
Would you keep it down?
