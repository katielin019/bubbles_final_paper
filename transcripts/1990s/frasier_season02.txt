{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hello, Steven, I'm listening.
'We're having a baby and there seems to be different advice 'about whether it's OK to let your kid get into bed with you in the morning.
' Stop right there, Steven.
It's OK.
All relationships require close and undivided attention, don't they, Roz?
Uh-huh.
'What if you and your wife enjoy making love in the mornings?
' Trust me, after the baby comes, that won't be an issue any more.
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.
We'll be back after these messages.
Roz, how can you be reading now?
It's something I picked up in elementary school, and it stuck.
- What is so captivating?
- "Slow Tango In South Seattle".
Every woman I see is carrying that book.
It's impossible to put down.
Read the first paragraph.
I guarantee you'll be hooked.
"There are tangos that come flowing from the wine-coloured sea "from the rust of a hundred sunken ships.
"This is one of those dances.
" - Well?
- There are books that make your stomach rumble and thrust your lunch ever upward!
This is one of those books!
You men are all alike - you have no soul.
Except for this one - the future Mr Roz Doyle, Thomas Jay Fallow.
- My God, it's him!
- Do you know him?
Yes.
He used to drop into a bar I frequented in Boston.
A bit pretentious, though - stuck out like a sore thumb.
You used to drink with Thomas Jay Fallow?
I helped him get through his writer's block.
In future, I'll remember to use my powers for good, not evil.
I don't care what you think.
He's on "Bookchat" tomorrow and you're introducing him.
No!
I'd have to say I liked his book.
It's hard to lie to someone's face.
No, it's easy for someone as bright, charming and articulate as you.
Well, perhaps you're right.
See how easy it is?
- Eight, nine Stop it, Eddie!
- He just wants to play.
Yeah, well, therapy is not a game.
Stop it!
Stop it, I said!
If he keeps this up, there's no point to these exercises.
Attaboy!
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hey, Niles!
- Ah, doing your exercises.
Yes, and if someone doesn't let us get on with them, he'll get a spank on his fanny.
Don't don't let me - Unless you want to!
- What's up?
In your room, I noticed you had pictures of Frasier and Frederick and an autographed one from someone named Ken Griffey Jr, but none of Maris and me.
So I brought you this.
Thanks.
Why is Maris wearing jodhpurs?
Taken up horse riding?
No, she wanted to, but her quadriceps are so tight she can't straddle anything larger than a Border collie.
- I can't believe this!
- What are you yapping about?
This book!
It's written by a man I knew.
He's taken something I told him in confidence and turned it into this trash!
"Slow Tango"?
I've just started reading that.
You mean to tell me that young man is based on you?
Yes.
But did Thomas Jay Fallow have the grace to thank me?
No!
- Not even in the acknowledgements!
- What's it about?
- That is not important.
- His first time.
- Thank you, Daphne!
- Your first time doing what?
Changing a flat tyre!
So this whole book's about the night you conceived Frederick!
You'll be happy to know that was not my first time.
And that it wasn't your only time!
- Who was this charitable lass?
- That is not important.
- His piano teacher.
- His piano teacher?
Thanks again, Daphne!
It's no secret.
It's all there in black and white.
About your awkward teenage lunging, and how you used to call your chest hair your "rug of love".
He did take some literary licence.
So you can't bring a woman to ecstasy with your panther-like prowess?
That part he got right.
This really fries me.
That woman taking advantage of my kid.
I paid $10 a week for piano lessons so you could get your hedge trimmed.
Wait a minute!
Not Miss Warner?
This wasn't going on during your lessons, too?
No, while Frasier was getting his Rachmaninoffs, I was studying music!
Now, look!
This was not some tawdry older woman lusting after young flesh!
Clarice and I cared for each other.
She showed me a world I'd never known.
And wouldn't know again for six and a half years.
It's true.
As Mr Fallow put it, she saw your sensitive, poetic side and you couldn't help noticing how her bosom brushed your cheek when she reached for the metronome.
How can a man who drank so heavily remember so much?
- Yet forgets who told him the story.
- He'll get a little reminder today.
- No, no!
- I want it.
Give it to me.
"I budded when you kissed me.
"I withered when you left me.
"I bloomed a few months while you loved me.
" - Would you calm down?
- When I've exacted my pound of flesh.
Wait till I get my book signed.
- Let me.
It's my story.
- Stop it!
You haven't told anyone?
They'd have a field day.
Frasier, give me credit for a little discretion.
Hey, piano boy!
Way to pound those ivories!
Listen!
It's imperative that this not be commonly known.
Hey, Doc, it's no big deal.
Anything for you?
I've still got some feeling on the other side of my head.
I had a similar experience when I was 16.
An older woman introduced me to the mysteries of love.
Of course, she was a hooker.
It was a birthday present from my dad, OK?
Want to know the ironic thing?
All I wanted was a bike.
How could you expect me not to tell anybody?
You can't keep something like that bottled up.
I only told one person.
- Hello, Frasier, Roz!
- Hi.
I was doing my restaurant review this afternoon when I came up with the perfect sandwich, named after you: Frasier Crane's Double Decker.
It consists of aged pheasant, spring chicken and plenty of tongue.
Listen!
"I wept as our bodies made the music of love.
" "I'm your rhapsody.
Play me.
" "Crescendo, my young maestro, crescendo.
" "My vessel yearns to dock in the magnificence of your harbour.
" That's not in the book.
One thing I must ask you - what was your inspiration for this love story?
Ooh!
It's his last chance!
It was actually given to me by God.
By God!
Do you believe his grandiosity?
I'm God, and he knows it!
We'll be back with the divinely inspired Thomas Jay Fallow right after this break.
Excuse me.
I want to call my husband and see if he can take a long lunch.
Thomas Jay Fallow.
Frasier!
Frasier Crane!
I can't believe it!
I see my name hasn't entirely escaped your sieve-like memory.
- Why would it?
- It's not in your acknowledgements, you egomaniacal thief!
You read my book!
I didn't have to read it.
I lived it.
Not that anybody would know that from your acknowledgements.
You mention your kindergarten teacher, but not me!
I only gave you the story which you have merchandised into this $1,000,000 treacle machine!
I'm finished now.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know how I could have been so thoughtless.
- I owe you everything!
- Oh, no, no!
Oh, my God!
Frasier, what did you do to the poor man?
- What happened?
- Frasier made him cry.
"Slow Tango" has put thoughts in Maris' head.
I found her cooing over the student who skims the koi pond.
- I wouldn't concern myself.
- It's innocent flirting?
No.
I just wouldn't concern myself.
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad, Niles.
Congratulations.
Maris heard Thomas Fallow acknowledge his debt to you.
Yes, I had a chat with him this afternoon.
- Was he properly contrite?
- I made him cry.
That's my boy!
You must be feeling pretty good.
Actually, the incident has left me strangely unsatisfied.
I still feel sort of empty.
I've been turning it around in my mind all day.
You kill me.
You got what you want and you're still not happy.
Frasier, life is not hard.
You make it hard.
You don't just enjoy things.
You analyse everything.
You could learn a big lesson from this dog here.
You know what makes him happy?
A sock.
Come on, Eddie.
What's troubling you goes deeper than your usual malaise.
- Shame on you!
- What for?
You just ran out on her!
"Leaving her bed as empty as a swallow's nest in fall.
" And you ask me what for!
I'd just been accepted to Harvard.
So you just leave in the night without so much as a kiss.
- You never said goodbye?
- She was sleeping so peacefully.
She had an early lesson.
I left a rose on her pillow.
- Aha.
- "Aha" what?
- "Aha" this: I have a theory.
- Why else would you say "aha"?
You were angry at Thomas Fallow for not thanking you for your contribution to his life.
But you're really angry at yourself for not thanking Miss Warner for her contribution to your life.
I was only 17.
I'm sure she understood.
Perhaps she didn't.
She was vulnerable, lonely, middle-aged.
It's possible her feelings for you ran deep, feelings you crushed when you left without a thank you or a goodbye.
Yes, well, thank you and goodbye.
All right.
Fine.
I'll just leave you with this thought: your encounter with Fallow was unsatisfactory because it didn't provide closure.
For that, you will have to make amends with Miss Warner.
Aha.
Very funny, Dad!
"He had been a teenage Balboa, "an explorer of the rising pinnacles and gently curving slopes of my body.
"In one explosive burst of discovery, "he had staked claim to the Pacific Ocean that was my soul.
"But now, he was leaving, "going, vanishing, like a solitary boat on the lonely horizon, "departing like a train, rolling ceaselessly through the night, "exiting swiftly like " "And so, he was gone.
" "Now, in the cool of the evening, I play my piano, "and his last words resonate through the notes: "I'll come back to you, my cherished one.
' "But he never did.
"And all that remains of him are the withered petals "of the rose he left upon my pillow.
" Clarice.
Time, the subtle thief of youth.
Hello.
May I help you?
- Ms Warner?
- Yes.
I I'm Frasier Crane.
I'm sorry, my memory's not what it used to be.
But, please, come in.
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, I would.
So, we know each other?
Well, we were friends.
More than friends.
You really don't remember?
I'm trying.
You must have some recollection of a fair-haired boy outside your door?
At the piano?
On the piano?
No, I'm sorry.
Before the memories come flooding back to you I should tell you we had a romance that didn't have a happy ending.
That's why I'm here.
Our last evening together, we walked through a summer storm and I kissed the raindrops off your nose and promised we'd always be together.
But I broke that promise.
You helped a shy adolescent take his first steps to becoming a man and I repaid you by running off and leaving you with just memories.
And not many of those, either.
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, you're so sweet!
- Of course I can forgive you.
- Thank you.
It's such a relief to get that off my chest.
- 'Mother?
I'm going now!
' - You run along, Clarice!
Clarice?
Excuse me.
Dear, this is Frasier Crane.
Apparently, we were quite an item once.
Frasier Crane?
What are you doing here?
Obviously, making an enormous mistake.
Mother, would you get us some iced tea?
She's getting rid of me, but I'll be back.
My God!
I can't believe you're here.
- It's got to be 20 - 25.
And look at you!
Look at you!
You look incredible.
Well, sure, compared to my mother.
No.
That's not what I mean.
You look - stunning.
- Well, thank you.
And you, you've become a very handsome man.
- And successful, too.
- Thank you.
You're here because of that book, aren't you?
Yes, and I'd like to apologise right off.
I told that story in confidence.
It was never meant to be in print.
There's no need to apologise.
That was a lovely time in my life.
It was nice to relive it.
So are you married?
- Divorced.
You?
- I never married.
I came to apologise about more than just the book.
I never felt quite right about the way I left things.
I abandoned you.
It was selfish and cowardly.
Oh, Frasier, relax.
I always felt guilty for short-changing you on your music lessons.
Do you still keep it up?
Oh, the piano?
Yes.
I was so nervous about coming here and now it just feels like old times.
Sit at middle C. Then the metronome.
I, well Maybe I should get going.
At the risk of sounding forward, would you have a coffee with me?
Thanks, but I'll have to say no.
The age difference is no longer an issue.
- Hi, honey.
Ready to go?
- I'll be right out.
- Are you and he?
- Uh-huh.
I wasn't interested in 40-year-old men then and I guess I'm still not.
It's great to see you again, though.
Bye, Mom!
Good.
Now we're alone.
See what I did?
I put a raindrop on my nose!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ironing your son's socks.
Why don't you twist them into balls like you do mine?
He says it bruises the cashmere.
He likes them pressed, folded, then neatly arranged in sock dividers.
I saw them in a catalogue once, but couldn't imagine who would buy such silly things.
Of course, I hadn't met Dr Crane yet.
We thought there'd been a mix-up at the hospital.
When Niles came along, it shot that theory all to hell.
Oh, Dad, please.
Coaster.
Your beer is sweating.
So am I. You want to shove one of those under my can?
If he could, he would.
Mrs Greenway, what a pleasant surprise.
- That's him.
- Won't you come in?
I had to see him again, but now I'm positive.
That is the horny little mixed breed who got my Phoebe pregnant.
You can't just bust in here accusing my dog.
I had to keep shooing him away from Phoebe in the park!
Look at him.
He doesn't care whose life he's ruined!
All he cares about is his own selfish pleasure!
You know your problem, Dorothea?
You got a bad attitude.
That's why nobody sits with you in the park.
There's no way Eddie could be the father.
He's been neutered.
Oh, really?
Then how do you explain these?
Oh, my God!
- They're miniature Eddies!
- Aren't they adorable?
Well, I'm glad you think so, because they're yours.
Bad dog!
Look what you did!
Here, take these.
Dad, I expect an explanation.
I thought Eddie had been fixed.
All you had to do was look.
Well, I'm glad to say I've never been that bored.
- Couldn't you just eat 'em up?
- For God's sake.
Don't love them.
They'll think they're staying.
Keep them off the couch.
Why did you let him run in the park?
Haven't you seen the way he romances my towel warmer?
He's cooped up here all day.
In the park, I let him get some exercise.
Apparently, that's not all he got.
I've found the perfect name for this one.
Stop!
Dogs only need names if you plan to call them to you.
Listen, you get right back in there, you mangy little thing!
My God!
I'm going to the radio station.
We'll talk when I get back.
Oh, relax, Frasier.
I'll have Eddie taken care of tomorrow.
You better.
Daphne, give me that box.
Where are you taking them?
- To unload them at the station.
- Couldn't we keep them for a while?
No.
We don't want them taking after their father.
It may be too late already.
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop staring at me!
Hello, Roz.
Don't you look lovely?
- I don't want one.
- I didn't say anything.
Betty from accounting warned me.
Where did you find them?
In my living room.
These are Eddie's mongrel seed.
Do you know anybody that wants six puppies?
Six?
All right, Eddie!
Please.
I've been in the hallway for an hour trying to unload them.
- I haven't had any luck.
- Not everybody likes dogs.
Take me.
I'm a cat person.
It's not like I'd buy a cat mug, but I had a cat when I was growing up.
We were almost inseparable.
Muffles or Scruffles, something like that.
You know, Roz, it's possible there's a dog lover inside you just dying to get out.
Don't you think so?
Come on.
Just take a look.
Come on.
Take a look.
Have a look.
Oh, he's adorable!
Oh, come here, little fella!
Oh.
Aren't you the cutest little thing?
Oh, yeah.
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Oh!
I love you too.
There.
Happy now?
Roz, how can you just toss him aside after such a tender display of affection?
I can do it with men, too.
Come on.
It's time to start the show.
Phil, puppy!
Puppy!
They're all on to me.
All right, you behave yourselves.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, coming to you from KACL 780 Talk Radio.
I'll be with you for the next three hours.
Roz, who's our first caller?
Rita is on line four.
She feels overwhelmed at home.
Hello, Rita.
I'm listening.
'Yeah, Dr Crane.
'Oh, Dr Crane, thank you for taking my call.
'I I tell you, I 'I'm about to lose my mind.
'I am raising four kids by myself.
'The oldest one is not even seven and the others are under five.
'Between cooking, cleaning, changing diapers and tripping over toys 'I feel sometimes like I am about to snap.
'What should I do?
' Have you considered getting a puppy?
If we can't have this one, are there any others available?
No.
We found homes for the others.
- Thanks for coming over.
- But the children.
Dr Crane There are other dogs in the world.
Now, give me that.
Thank you for coming over.
Thank you.
I thought you might like some wine and pâté.
I made some lemonade for the children.
Where are the Thomasons?
Why is that dog still here?
I'm sorry, but they struck me as unfit guardians.
For God's sake.
He works at the zoo!
She's a nurse!
Billy's an altar boy and Kathy is a campfire girl!
They had a dark aura.
They had a ten-acre farm!
I'd have gone with them!
I see.
So you want me to give him away to just anybody?
I'm not saying that.
It's just that he can't stay here.
- Hello, Niles.
Come in.
- I hope you don't mind my stopping by.
Maris is hosting the Women's League Senior Yoga Group.
And, well, old money and body stockings Say no more.
You're welcome to hide out here.
- I see the kennel is still open.
- Yes, but that's the last one.
I'd found a home for him, but Daphne thought the family wasn't nice enough.
- Some pâté, Niles?
- I didn't reject them.
The dog did.
Canines have a very keen sense of who's a nice person.
Many's the time I've chosen a man based solely on the way my mum's spaniel took to him.
Daphne, that is preposterous, letting a dog choose your dates.
It's true.
If a dog likes a man, it's a good bet he's warm and sensitive.
I didn't get a good look at this little tike.
Come here, boy.
Come to your Uncle Niles.
Oh!
Oh!
He's taken quite a shine to you.
Yes.
Happens all the time.
Daphne, would you take the dog away?
Phone the Thomasons and tell them we've reconsidered.
All right, but only for a two-week trial.
- Thank you.
- Come along, Basil.
I told you not to name them!
- Hello, Dad.
- Afternoon, boys.
Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie had a little appointment down at the vet's.
I can't help but notice he still has that spring in his step.
We started heading down there, but the traffic was a bear.
You get a sunny day and everybody forgets how to drive.
You are going to reschedule?
Oh, yeah.
I'll call in the morning.
This is the second time you've cancelled.
What's the problem?
'There's no problem.
What's the big deal?
'I'll call tomorrow.
Relax, will you?
' - Dear God, he's licking me!
- Eddie!
Eddie, just stop.
Niles You have liver behind your ears.
I imagine I must have picked up a cracker and inadvertently scratched behind my ear.
You had a wad of cold meat behind your ears and you didn't feel it?
That's the story I'm sticking with, yes.
I want an assurance you'll take care of it.
- You promise?
- I said I'd do it and I will!
Get off my back!
I'll be down at Duke's.
Ever notice how much faster he moves when he's wrong?
He's got a psychological block against taking Eddie there.
I'll have to do it.
Somebody has to be responsible.
Good boy.
Come on.
Let's go.
Eddie?
Uh, Niles.
Oh.
Now, Eddie, it's a routine operation.
They say it's almost painless, although I can't imagine No, Niles.
Perhaps it's best we don't discuss the operation.
We might spook him.
Excuse me?
Are you saying he understands me?
Well, he understands the word B-A-T-H.
God knows how much English he's picked up.
Fine.
What are we doing?
Eddie, come here!
This is ridiculous.
Look at him!
What are you staring at?
You know why you're here, don't you?
Listen, it's for your own good.
You'll be much happier afterwards.
Look, your day-to-day routine, it'll be exactly the same.
You'll be able to sleep, run around with your little buddies, go play in the woods, chase the birds, lick your Did I mention sleep?
You got a lot of nerve!
You all right, boy?
Of course he is allright, dad.
Why are you so upset?
- I'm helping you out.
- That's a load of crap!
We agreed on this.
You had a problem so I took charge.
I don't need you taking charge.
Mind your own business.
I don't need your help and I don't want it!
It doesn't matter who brought him here.
I can do it, I feed him, walk him and give him his bath.
- Eddie!
- No!
- See what you did?
- Me?
OK, thanks.
Listen, Daphne's here in case anybody sees him.
I got the guys at the station circulating Eddie's picture.
- I'll look for him some more.
- You've done enough.
- Sit still and drink your tea.
- I hate tea.
In an emergency, it's all I know how to do.
That's a real comfort, coming from a health-care provider.
Dad, I'm sorry.
There was no luck at the pound.
They'll call if they find a dog matching Eddie's description.
A $500 reward for Eddie?
Are you sure it's enough?
It's about 500 more than I'd pay to get you back.
Dad, I said I was sorry.
I can't sit here.
I'm going back to the park.
What makes you think he'll show up there?
That's his hangout.
Didn't you have a place where you met women, a place where you got lucky?
- Well, I suppose so.
- Didn't you go back?
To the park!
This time we'll comb every inch of it, every tree, every bush.
- Daphne, we'll need help.
- Call Niles.
Tell him we'll pick him up.
Why go into the wild without one of the great outdoors men?
Oh, this is odd.
I just got a psychic flash about Eddie.
- Well?
- It doesn't make any sense.
All I'm getting is a picture of Eddie sitting with Dr Crane.
Dr Frasier Crane he listens - Any luck?
- I couldn't find him.
- Where's Niles?
- We split up to cover more ground.
Scrunch down.
If Eddie sees you here, he'll run away again.
Let's call it a night.
You've been here three hours.
I was on a stakeout for 15 hours without getting out of the car.
We had a contest to see who'd last longest.
The winner was Canteen McHugh.
Know why we called him that?
I think I can guess.
His bladder was the size of a canteen.
Thank you for clearing that up.
You could have slung it on your shoulder and done a 20-mile march through the desert.
- Big, huh?
- That's what I've been saying.
Close that window!
It's freezing!
- It's like a blast furnace.
- At my age, you get cold easily.
Right.
Dad, I've just developed a very interesting theory about you.
If I begged you, would you share it with me?
If that's your attitude, just forget it.
Hello?
Oh, Niles.
- Did he find him?
- Just a second.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Hang on.
- OK.
Go ahead, Niles.
- 'I'm in the park and I'm lost.
- 'Thank God for my cellular.
' - Did you see Eddie?
'No, but I thought I saw a raccoon.
'When I stopped running, I had no idea where I was.
- 'You've got to help me.
' - Niles, just remain calm.
Let me think back to my Boy Scout training.
Now, we're on the northeast corner of the park.
All right, look into the heavens and see if you can spot the North Star.
Then you turn 12 degrees For God's sake!
Walk towards the horn.
'I hear it, Dad.
I'm walking.
' All right.
Just keep following it.
'I see a grove of trees and a fountain 'and a horrible hunchbacked old man.
Stay away from me!
'No.
It was just a bush.
'Things are beginning to look familiar.
Keep honking.
'I think I'm homing in.
I'm quite sure this is the way.
' OK, you can hang up now.
That was a harrowing experience.
A shrub and a raccoon and you live to tell about it.
Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie.
I hope you understand.
I think I'd like to go home now and hold my wife.
That is, if she'll let me.
I'll just hail a cab.
Call us from the curb so we know you're safe.
You're probably tired.
If you want to go, it's OK.
That's all right, Dad.
I'll stay for a while longer.
I'm sorry I cut you off like that before.
I've just never gone in for psychological mumbo jumbo.
Probably started on the force when we had to see "The Squirrel".
Who?
Dr Bergman.
The department shrink.
It was his nickname.
Guys got sent to him when they got squirrelly.
He'd show you ink blots and ask about your toilet habits.
I could talk about that with Nat Dembrowski.
- We nicknamed him the Big - Thank you.
Look, it wasn't just Eddie I was mad about.
Eddie was the straw that broke the camel's back.
I'm always being told to take my feet off the furniture, put a coaster under my beer, turn the TV down.
I used to make the rules and now I follow them.
Does this make any sense to you?
Psychologically, it makes perfect sense.
Slowly your responsibilities have been taken away from you and you Well, you feel symbolically castrated.
Why does everything with you shrinks start in the crotch?
All right, all right.
Well, maybe my rules are too rigid.
Maybe I should relax a little.
No, no.
Hey, it's your house.
You do what you want.
I don't know what's bugging me.
I guess it's not easy for a guy like me to not be in charge.
People confuse not being in charge with not being respected.
I hope you're not making that mistake.
Cos you command a great deal of respect.
Every day I hold myself up to the Martin Crane yardstick.
I guess a son always wants to make his father proud.
Yeah, I guess.
So?
Yeah, yeah, you're doing fine.
Even if you are a big pain in the ass.
I don't know if I could have made Eddie have that operation.
That's a tough thing for a guy to do to another guy.
Amen to that.
You know, it's getting late.
What do you say we get some sleep?
Eddie!
Come here, boy!
Hey, attaboy!
Hey-hey!
Good to see you, fella.
How are you doing?
- Welcome him back.
- Hello, Eddie.
Good dog.
Oh, wet dog!
You're shivering.
Here.
We got to get you warmed up.
Dad, that's a 100% cashmere pullover!
It's meant to be worn with the collar up.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Oh, my God!
Fire, fire!
Eddie, where are you, boy?
- Dad, wake up!
Are you in there?
- Here, Eddie!
Dad, where are you?
- Have you seen Eddie?
- No!
Where is the fire?
It's all right!
False alarm!
The one over my bed went off.
- Thank God.
- And Eddie's back in my room.
The noise it makes!
It would be less upsetting to wake up on fire.
- What triggered it?
- Who knows?
I was dozing when it started screaming away for no reason.
I see.
What have we here?
Eddie, you've been smoking in Daphne's room!
Bad dog!
I know you have a no-smoking rule.
I'm sorry.
Every now and again, I feel a bit tense and I find a ciggy can be soothing.
Real soothing!
It should be an hour until my heart stops fibrillating.
It figures.
3:00 am, on the night before I have an early meeting.
Aren't you going back to bed?
No.
I'll just sit up for a bit.
- I'm feeling a bit blue.
- Anything you'd like to talk about?
No.
You need your sleep.
It's nothing important.
Just that my life's a gaping sinkhole and I'm marking time while the flower of my youth rots on the vine.
Well, so long as you're sure.
I really wish you'd tell me about it.
- If you must know, it's my love life.
- Really?
Have you been seeing a man?
Only when I close my eyes and concentrate.
- Going through a bit of a drought?
- Small wonder.
The rare times I do go out, it's with your father.
People assume I'm his daughter or his girlfriend.
Either way, it's like having a personal can of stud repellent.
I know how bleak these times can be, but they end sooner or later.
I remember a time when I was going through the same.
Just a week later, I met a lovely barmaid.
Sophisticated, if a bit loquacious.
We fell madly in love.
We got engaged.
She left me standing at the altar but the point is, I didn't give up.
I took my poor, battered heart and offered it to Lilith.
Put it in her food processor and hit the purée button.
I rebounded, and look how far I've come.
I'm divorced, lonely living with my father.
You missed your meeting with the new station manager.
Oh, no!
I completely forgot.
You look like you've been ridden hard and put away wet.
I was up with Daphne, competing to see whose love life was more pathetic.
On the bright side, I won.
I know what your problems are.
What are hers?
She's just having trouble finding men.
- Say no more.
- No, Roz, please.
You do not have to donate one of your boyfriends.
- I'd be happy to.
- One hates to break up a collection.
Triple espresso and my mocha latte.
- Does that chocolate look different?
- No.
I think they've switched to an inferior domestic brand.
Waxy.
- Sven Bachman, an aerobics coach.
- No.
This one's perfect.
Günther Dietrich.
He's loads of fun and he's a model.
A German narcissist.
Appealing combination.
- OK.
I'll keep looking.
- For what?
A man for Daphne.
- What?
- Here we go.
He's a tennis instructor called Brick.
Dear God, Frasier!
Sven, Günther, Brick?
Why not just soak Daphne in baby oil and hurl her over the prison wall?
I've dated all these guys.
Where do you think I came up with the imagery?
Listen, you little titmouse Niles, you are out of line here.
And, Roz, he does have a point.
You and Daphne are different.
Daphne is very shy and inexperienced.
You are You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who's more No one I've dated is good enough for her.
Is that what you're trying to say?
No.
That's what I'm trying not to say.
- I'm out of here.
- Wait!
No, I can't stay!
The fleet is in!
And this concludes our test of the emergency broadcast system.
In a real emergency, your radio would be melting in your hands.
We'll be right back after these messages.
In future, please keep your half-eaten food off my console.
- In fact, stay out of my sight.
- You're still mad.
I can tell.
There's that sensitivity that keeps you in such demand with the ladies.
Roz, I'm sorry if I insulted you, but I feel very protective about Daphne.
The man I'm looking for has to be good-looking, smart - Excuse me.
- Yes?
- I'm Tom Duran, the new manager.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Sorry about the meeting.
I slept through it.
Yeah, me too, and I was there.
Say, that's a beautiful tie.
I got this in London at one of those custom shops off Sloane Square.
I just came from London.
Five years with the BBC.
Really?
I love London.
The museums, the theatre.
Yeah.
I'm a big theatre buff.
I hated leaving.
- Why did you?
- I just went through a messy break-up.
I thought I'd sleep better with a continent between us.
Yes, I know the feeling.
So I take it then you are unattached?
Yes, but I haven't given up hope.
- You may be in the right place.
- Really?
Yes.
- You're fond of the English?
- Yes.
I have a weakness for people who are a bit eccentric.
- Really?
- 15 seconds.
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.
Tom, this may sound like short notice but if you're free Saturday, come for dinner.
- Thanks.
I'd like that.
- Great!
Hello, Seattle.
We're back.
Roz, whom do we have next?
James from Tacoma on line one.
Hello, James.
I'm listening.
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Tom.
Every job I take, word spreads like wildfire.
- What's that?
- Oh, you know.
Tell one or two people you're gay and it's all over the station.
Well, they don't call it broadcasting for nothing.
- He seems like a nice guy.
- He's OK.
I hope he's more than OK.
He just asked me out on a date.
- Frasier asked you out on a date?
- He asked me round for dinner.
What's his favourite wine?
- You should know - What?
- He's nuts about Chardonnay.
- Thanks.
Does he ask permission first?
No, he sets me up and I'm supposed to turn cartwheels like I'm Cinderella.
I told you, this is not a setup.
Tom doesn't even know you'll be here.
Oh, an ambush, then.
Much nicer.
My friends in Manchester used to set me up.
Always some gangly bounder with a long reach and he wasn't going for the Colman's mustard!
Tom is just a co-worker coming by for a pleasant dinner.
If some spark ignites, fine, but there is no pressure.
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Why?
What's wrong with it?
What about something with more oomph?
What about that strapless number?
Do you have any idea how uncomfortable a strapless bra is?
Thanks to my fraternity days, as a matter of fact, I do.
Tom, come in!
Good to see you.
- I thought you'd like Chardonnay.
- Oh, my!
That's my favourite.
- Like the place?
- It's a hell of a view.
It's even better from the bedroom.
Why don't we just start with a drink?
- Four places.
Who's joining us?
- Just my little household.
My father and his physical therapist, charming Daphne.
You live with your dad?
I can't imagine that.
It's great you get along, but doesn't having him here kind of cramp your love life?
Not at all.
Except when I bring my dates home, he tries to steal them.
He's quite the old rascal.
- Good evening.
- Oh, look who we have here!
Tom, I'd like you to meet Daphne.
Daphne, this is Tom Duran.
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.
Dr Crane, you didn't take his coat.
May I?
Ooh, this is strange!
I'm picking up a vibration from your coat.
- Excuse me?
- She feels she has psychic powers.
- You know those English eccentrics.
- You've just had a painful break-up.
- Yes.
You told her that!
- No.
A bitter dispute over opera recordings.
Excuse me.
I'll nip into the kitchen.
I have a bird to baste.
- Quite something, huh?
- She's great!
I love that accent!
Frasier, I don't have to put a tie on for this joker, do I?
- Tom, my father, Martin Crane.
- Nice to meet you.
Sorry about that "joker" business.
I call everybody joker.
Or jerk.
Pinhead.
Bozo.
Amazingly, he's free for dinner on short notice.
Why don't I just open this wine?
- Well?
- Oh, he's a looker!
I'm glad to have my lucky bra.
He's worth every wire digging into my rib cage.
He thinks you're great, too.
Oh, go on!
Oh, God!
Listen to me getting carried away like a schoolgirl!
No, I'm not raising my hopes tonight.
Though I'm glad I raised my bosom.
Let me tell you, you gonna love Seattle.
It's a real people place.
- Good food, great bars.
- Any you recommend?
I hang out at Duke's.
Great crowd.
Lot of young cops.
- You like football?
- Yeah!
I missed it in London.
We could see a game.
Frasier hates it, so it would just be us.
Hey, Frasier warned me about you.
Yeah, I guess I yell at the players too loud.
Here we are.
Tom Dad, I selected a little vintage for you, too.
I didn't bring the pull-tab for you to sniff.
Merci beaucoup.
Excuse me.
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
Oh, thank you.
- I'm just returning your book.
- Thank you.
Don't let me keep you.
- Am I interrupting something?
- I'm introducing a man to Daphne.
- I guess you don't want me around.
- Thank you.
How do you do?
- I'm Dr Niles Crane.
- I'm Tom Duran.
The bird's done.
All I need is strong arms to haul it out.
I don't need to be asked twice.
During the interview, her stomach rumbles and her body mic picks it up.
But what can I say?
"Excuse me, would Her Majesty care for a Tums"?
I could listen to your stories all night.
They're so funny.
And all involving bodily functions.
Tom, I could use a little hand.
No, Daphne.
After all that cooking, you must be strapless.
- Niles, can I speak with you?
- Yes.
- Did I do anything that offended you?
- No.
It must be in my head.
I sensed you had a problem with me dating Frasier.
Well, if you must know I'm sorry, what was the question?
Do you have a problem with me dating your brother?
No.
Niles, I didn't ask Tom to dinner so he could talk to you.
There are others who would like a crack at him.
That Tom's a great guy.
You think maybe him and Daphne?
I can't remember when I last had such a wonderful evening.
We should thank you.
I can't remember when I've laughed so hard.
You've still got Mr Crane going.
- Daphne, music might be appropriate.
- Good idea.
She's quite a woman, isn't she?
Yes, she's really something.
- Frasier, I was wondering - Yes?
Before the evening's over, could we get a little one-on-one time?
Ooh, I think I can arrange that.
He says he wants to be alone with you.
This is my lucky bra!
Keep the wine flowing!
I'll fix my lipstick!
I guess I'd better be hitting the old sack.
I don't want to stand in the way of young romance.
- Thanks.
- Good night, Tom.
Good night, Martin.
- You should run along, too.
- Yes.
And Frasier, I was wrong about Tom.
If I had to choose a man for Daphne, I'd pick him.
- Night, Tom.
Nice to meet you.
- Night.
Frasier, a word in your ear.
Excuse me.
I have to tell you something.
Dad wanted to, but I won the toss.
- Yes?
- I had a little chat with Tom.
He's interested in pursuing a romance but his object is not Daphne.
Damn that Roz!
No, no.
It's you.
Me?
That's impossible.
Tom's not gay.
He seems to be under that impression.
What made him think?
I just asked if he was attached.
Then we talked about the theatre and men's fashion Oh, my God!
- You realise what this means?
- Yes.
You're dating your boss.
You, of all people, should know the pitfalls of an office relationship.
But he didn't say He never mentioned I'll call you tomorrow.
But not too early of course.
So So God, I hate this song!
I've broken my rule for you.
I usually don't date guys I work with.
Yes, well, I've sort of relaxed my rule for you, too.
You're cute when you're nervous.
I must be downright adorable now.
Listen, Tom.
I'm sorry, but we seem to have gotten our lines crossed here.
The truth is, I'm entirely straight.
If you're not interested, just say so.
No, it's true.
I really am.
I invited you because you seemed so charming and you like the British.
I thought you might be perfect for Daphne.
I can't believe this!
You had no idea that I'm gay?
It never even occurred to me that you might be gay.
Well, it never even occurred to me that you might be straight.
Thank you.
I feel just awful.
It seems I've just been leading you on all night.
Oh, it's OK.
Honest mistake.
But I've made you think you've found a man sensitive enough to help you Frasier, I'll learn to love again.
- Of course.
- You'll apologise to Daphne?
For the rest of my days.
Does this mean your dad's not gay?
No, Dad's not gay.
But Niles Come on!
No, I'm afraid not.
So this Maris he kept mentioning is a woman?
Well, the jury's still out on that one.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
'It's not that I don't like him.
'But he's gotten so attached.
'I mean, roses every day after two dates!
' Maggie, first thing you have to do is sit Gavin down for a nice long conversation.
Tell him frankly that, though he wants to go at one speed, you need to go at another.
Tell him you're not rejecting him, you are fond of him, but I wonder what Roz, my non-PhD-holding producer, thinks you should do.
Any guy who's that clingy after two dates has a major insecurity problem.
I say, "Dump him.
Now.
And don't look back.
" 'It's so good to hear that, Roz.
'That's what I wanted to do, but I felt so guilty.
Thanks so much.
Bye.
' That takes us to a commercial.
This, for those who have forgotten, is the Dr Frasier Crane Show.
I confirmed your dinner reservation for three.
At your father's request, that's at Chez Shrimp.
Two letters to sign - a card for Clarence, the guard, we're all signing, and a notice on the KACL bowling team that I'll file in the trash.
Oh, wonderful.
Another card.
I, as resident wit, will have to be clever.
At least I've got another KACL birthday bash to look forward to.
I can just taste that frozen cake now and hear wild applause as an adult snuffs out a handful of tiny candles.
- What are you grousing about?
- Oh, nothing.
Yes, the pageantry never stops.
Mr Fancy Pants.
- He's got to buy a German car.
- It's not my fault we broke down.
If you'd bought American, they could fix it here.
I always buy American so you can go to the nearest garage.
I could break down alone in the middle of Alaska!
A thought to raise all our spirits.
This traffic is murder.
We could walk, but humidity may ruin my loafers.
Does calfskin pucker?
Yes, that's why on humid farms, the calf is the most made fun of of all the animals.
Don't be snide.
We'll be here for a while.
Let's try and make pleasant conversation.
We are a family.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Have you been driving long?
- Not really.
- Got any good stories?
Ever hear of a woman having a baby in a cab?
- It's a classic.
- Why?
Did that happen in this cab?
- It's about to.
- You're pregnant?
Yes.
Ow!
Don't panic.
It may be false labour.
My waters just broke.
I'm in a puddle of water.
Calfskin!
- Closest hospital is First Methodist.
- We'll never make it.
Pull over!
- Try to park facing downhill.
- Niles!
- I can't have my baby here.
- There's no need to be concerned.
We are trained medical professionals.
Niles, help her!
- Hurry!
- I know.
The other door!
Oh, for goodness sake!
Is anybody there?
Come in!
It's most important to breathe deeply.
Do as I do.
- Do you feel faint or short of breath?
- Yes, both of those.
- 'Hello?
Go ahead.
' - Yes, I'm calling from cab No 804.
This is an emergency.
Your driver just went into labour.
We're at the corner of 14th and Sycamore.
- We need an ambulance now.
- 'OK.
' - It hurts.
- It's natural.
- No, you're squeezing my hand.
- I only did this once in medical school.
I remember lots of blood and a lino floor hurtling toward my forehead.
- You fainted?
- Switch places and see how you do!
Good God, Niles!
I'll do this!
- The baby's really coming now!
- When he does come, I'll catch him.
Just continue with your breathing.
Don't feel guilty for having a baby in a cab.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Many great Americans have been born this way.
Cab Calloway comes to mind.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I specialise in the head, not the lower body.
It's less messy that way.
Not that your lower portion is messy.
It's beautiful.
Not that I'm looking!
- Is the pain that bad?
- No, you're driving me crazy!
Move it out, come on!
- You a doctor, too?
- No, a retired cop.
Well what took you so long?
It's really hurting.
Everything's going to be just fine.
I've delivered a few babies, and some are older than you are now.
Frasier will hold your hand, Niles will look out for an ambulance and I'll help your beautiful baby out.
OK?
- OK.
- Are there any questions?
Should our meter still be running?
Hello?
Are you back yet?
Well, go on, turn your heads.
OK.
So I guess you've had some excitement tonight.
No, I haven't!
Your father made it sound exciting on the phone: delivering a baby in a taxi.
I see that not as excitement but as my duty to use the skills I honed in medical school.
Yes, Niles ran to a falafel stand for a pot of hot water.
I can't get over the feeling of being there when a person's life begins.
One minute, it's a blob inside some lady, next minute, it's a person.
Blob - person.
The miracle of birth summed up in one poetic phrase.
I bet you have fond memories of your son's birth.
Oh, yes, of course.
The first time I held him in my arms as a newborn, it was as if everything else simply melted away.
There was just a father, a son and the distant sound of Lilith saying, "If you come near me again, Frasier, I'll drop you with a deer rifle"!
At least now fathers see their sons being born.
In my day, they stuck us in the waiting room, smoking and reading Life magazine.
I remember what I was reading when Niles was born.
It was about Mickey Mantle.
Talk about life setting you up for a fall.
- I'm turning in.
- Night, Dad.
I wonder what dreams I'll have after this talk about childbearing.
Probably the one where my mother says, "Daphne, you're 50 and you've never given me grandchildren.
" So I say, "That was my choice.
I was thinking of my career.
" "But did you ever think of me"?
"Mother, I don't want to start this again.
Just drop it"!
But will she drop it?
"Oh, shut up, Mother"!
I wonder how many more people she's got in there.
- Sherry, Niles?
- No, thank you.
- Something on your mind?
- Actually, yes.
For months, I've noticed my thoughts drifting to the same subject - will I ever be a father?
There are pros and cons.
But, watching that birth, I realised it's something I really want.
I think.
It's natural to have parental stirrings.
I wake up nights thinking about it.
- Have you talked to Maris?
- Not yet.
I like to know what I want before Maris tells me.
I'm just not sure I'm ready for fatherhood.
No one is ever sure.
These days, teenagers who want to become parents are given a sack of flour to keep for a week, as if it were a baby.
- You're kidding?
- No.
They hold it, they care for it.
It gives a good idea of the responsibility of parenthood.
What could be better than hands-on experience?
Might be worth a try!
- I wasn't - Why not?
Maris is away.
I'm desperate to resolve the issue.
Where do you keep the flour?
In the kitchen.
The cabinet next to the sink.
Yes, here it is.
"Extra-refined.
" It's taking after its old man already.
No, that's the sugar.
We're going to do this right.
Now, here is the flour.
"Bleached, 100% fat free, best when kept in an airtight container.
" This one's taking after its mother.
Hello.
May I join you?
Or should I say, "May we"?
Mais oui.
So you're continuing with our little baby experiment?
Yes.
And it's been quite a learning experience.
Not easy, though!
I take him everywhere, get up for 2:00 am feedings, the whole exhausting nine yards.
What a beautiful baby!
How old is he?
- Eight weeks.
- Great age, isn't it?
Niles?
I can't help noticing that your child has a little boo-boo.
It's nothing.
I was playing him some Brahms.
Never too early to ingrain them.
I must have begun conducting with a chopstick and I accidentally ran him through.
What young parent doesn't tell that story?
The scuffs were the fault of my new houseman, Ngee.
- What did Ghee do?
- No, it's Ngee.
- Ghee.
- No, no.
Ngee.
Oh, who cares?
What did he do?
He'd just given my car a shine, when I sat the baby on the roof and down it went onto the driveway.
Would you watch him while I order?
Hey, Frase.
This seat taken?
Well, actually No.
Clarence is doing better.
I just dropped his card off.
- Clarence?
- The guard.
Oh, down at the station.
Good.
I didn't know he was sick.
You signed his "get well" card.
That wasn't a birthday card?
No, he's in hospital having a kidney transplant.
Oh, my God!
I thought it was his birthday.
I wrote, "You're not getting older, just closer to death.
" How could you think it was his birthday?
I didn't recognise the traditional card for a sick man - a giant bunny.
- Has he read it yet?
- No, he was asleep.
I'll look so callous.
We've got to get that card back!
How can you be leaving?
I asked you to baby-sit!
I have no time for your insanity!
I have to go steal a "get well" card from a kidney patient.
What does that say "Geb "?
No, it's "Get".
"Get well soon.
Love, Andrea.
" Just copy it down and move on to the next name.
We have to transfer all the names on to the new card.
I want to get it back tonight.
So you snuck into his room and stole his card?
I did not sneak in.
Luckily, he was in extreme pain and heavily sedated.
You should have found out who this Clarence was.
You never pay attention to the little people.
Yes, why don't we invite the commoners to drag me to the square and stone me.
That must be Niles.
He's taking me to the hospital.
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
- What are you doing with that?
- Forging a parent-child bond.
That's a relief.
I was afraid it might be something stupid.
I don't wear it in public.
But I want a true picture of parenthood.
- And?
- It's driving me batty.
Feedings every two hours, constantly monitoring where he is.
You can get obsessed with worry.
Last night, I dreamt my flour sack was abducted and the kidnappers started sending me muffins in the mail.
On the plus side, I've learnt a lot.
If I ever go through the real thing, I'll make a wonderful parent.
Niles, what has happened to your child?
I was practising my t'ai chi and I accidentally kicked him into the reflecting pool.
Then I brought him inside and left him by the hearth to dry.
He caught on fire?
It was not that careless.
A real child would have cried before it burst into flames.
Ah!
Time for his nap!
- Turn him over if he starts fussing.
- No.
- I'm role-playing, Dad.
- Try the role of a sane person.
So, any closer to making a decision about fatherhood?
No.
One minute, I think I could never stand the stress, the next, I'm daydreaming about taking my son to the museum or listening to his first "Für Elise" and I swear there are tears in my eyes.
Oh, dear Eddie!
That dingo's got your baby.
Oh, God!
Eddie, Dad!
Don't worry.
I'll clean up that mess.
For God's sake, calm down!
I think it's time you realised something.
That is not a person.
It's a bag of flour.
It's easy to tell the difference.
People don't have recipes on their backs.
This is stupid!
We're talking about having a baby here.
You make that decision in your gut, not intellectually.
What is your gut feeling?
- I'm not sure.
- You'd better be.
Nothing can prepare you for having a kid.
It's hard.
Full of surprises.
Maybe your kid won't want piano lessons.
- He might like baseball.
- Don't even say that.
Just trust yourself.
You'll know if it's right or not.
I'm finished, if you're ready to take me to the hospital.
I wonder if this experiment wasn't just a way of convincing myself I'm ready for something, when I know I'm not.
- What do you mean?
- I want to have a baby.
But I just don't want it enough.
Oh That's the hardest thing I've ever had to admit.
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's so selfish.
I'm the right age, I have the money, the energy.
It's only selfish to have babies for the wrong reasons.
People should find out if they're ready.
Anyway, feeling this way now doesn't mean things can't change in a few years.
Perhaps you're right.
Maris and I will be over 40 then.
Maybe we should look into getting some of her eggs frozen.
Oh, I suspect they're only a few degrees away from that now.
Who is this Clarence fellow?
Some guy down at the station.
Dr Crane!
It's Clarence!
Were you in there looking for me?
- As a matter of fact, I was.
- They changed my room.
This is so sweet of you.
Clarence is such a fixture, the station isn't the same without him.
You find the time to come here while the rest of those bums at the station don't even send me a card.
Actually, Clarence, there's an explanation for that.
Make the music stop!
You see, the others at the station don't know you the way I do.
Well, listen, you get yourself well.
I miss seeing you every time I walk by the place you tend to be.
Niles!
What are you doing?
Looking at these babies, wondering if I made the right decision.
- Niles - Look at them!
They're healthy, beautiful, lovable Flammable.
Maybe I'm more ready for parenthood than I thought.
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Arleen!
And this must be Yes, little Nathan.
I'm so glad I ran into you.
We both want to thank you guys again.
Would one of you like to hold him?
Yes, I would.
Oh, he's beautiful.
Yes, why shouldn't you cry?
Everything's so new to you So much life to live - No, you've got his leg bent back.
- Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
Well, see you, guys.
Say "hi" to your dad for me.
- Perhaps I made the right decision.
- I'd say so.
Ready to go?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Thank you for your call, Lorraine.
And before the commercial break, Roz has an important message.
Roz?
What's that Roz?
Can't come to the mic?
Well, what she wanted to say was Tomorrow, on Amber Edwards' "Bookchat", sociologist Lamont Myman discusses his book, "Violence in the Workplace - Why Co-Workers Kill".
Something which becomes more and more relevant.
We'll be right back.
Open up, you piece of tin!
- Roz!
- What are you doing here?
And you?
Shouldn't you wait till after the show before exiting?
- I have a little urge.
Damn it!
- What is the matter?
I have got to have chocolate!
It's kind of a celebration.
At 11:07 am, I finished one of those magazine diets.
"Seven days to a healthier, calmer you.
" Come on, Roz!
I'm doing this for your own good.
Wait!
Something came out!
Damn!
Chocolate-covered raisins.
I'd like to meet the idiot who came up with these.
Take a grape, let it shrivel into a disgusting little wart and cover it with perfectly good chocolate.
What the hell!
I'll suck the chocolate off.
Be sure to save what's left to make some wine!
I see those years of finishing school paid off.
Mon frère, we're in luck.
Meadow Wood Properties still has one share left in the mini-mall.
- We should buy it.
Give me five, Bro.
- I told you I'm not interested.
It's a 12% return.
We've a chance to make a real killing.
You and Maris are wallowing in money like a couple of yuppie hogs.
This has nothing to do with Maris.
This is my money.
- And mine.
- And yours.
Show some understanding.
Maris uses her money to emasculate him.
This is his attempt to stop feeling like a financial eunuch and regain some shred of his former manhood - such as it was.
Well?
- 12%?
- Net.
If you're unhappy, at the end of the year I'll buy you out.
- OK, I'm in.
- Thank you, Frasier.
Thank you, Roz.
That "financial eunuch" bit was great.
Well, look what I had to work with.
Hey, check this out!
25 cents off on a pack of Butterbuds imitation butter.
My!
I can taste that scampi now!
Well?
Daphne, very nice!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'd be more flattered if I didn't know how hard up you both are.
I'm going out with Derek, but I can't choose a fragrance.
I've got it pinned down to these two.
Heather: "fresh and bouncy as a spring morning".
Or Forbidden: "your passport to erotic realms of pleasure".
- How many times have you been out?
- It's our third date.
Forbidden.
So what if it's our third date?
Well, sexual mores being what they are in America, the third date is usually when two healthy adults decide whether or not to - take it to the next level.
- What kind of randy custom is that?
First date, second date, let's pitch our knickers!
It may be the third date for you, but it takes more than three dinners to get bangers and mash with me.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
- You look even lovelier than usual.
- Thank you.
Is that Forbidden?
In every sense of the word.
I'll scrub my neck with unscented soap.
You Americans have an unhealthy obsession with sex.
I'm sorry we can't all be as chaste and restrained as the Royal family!
- Good one, Dad!
- I've been saving it!
Frasier, good news.
I spoke to my broker.
Meadow Wood Properties have leased Instead of 12%, they're projecting a 15% return.
Fantastic!
Let's go celebrate at an exclusive boîte.
Yes, but the question is, what boîte?
- Charise?
- Too noisy.
- Alsace?
- Too bright.
- Papillon?
- Too crowded.
We've run out of boîtes.
A city this size and only three boîtes.
How do we live?
- I'm going to Duke's.
How about you?
- Looking for a place to eat.
Come and have a beer with me.
- At Duke's?
- Yeah.
- Us?
- Yeah.
- With you?
- Am I speaking Swahili?
Yeah!
You two, at Duke's, with me, a beer, if you want!
Gee!
Good God, do you believe that?
No.
No one in the family has ever been invited to Duke's.
Not even Mother.
Though at times she could be quite the old rummy.
Why, after 30 years, is he suddenly inviting us there?
- Cheerio!
- Daphne!
Has Dad said anything to you about us and Duke's?
- Has he been planning this?
- You mean, behind your backs?
- Precisely.
- No!
What a couple of wallies!
I have never met a family that's so uncomfortable with each other.
Could it be he just wants a pint with his sons?
No.
Duke's is where Dad goes to escape the stresses and strains of everyday life.
In other words, us.
Well, you could sit here analysing why he invited you and fritter the night away, or - here's a thought - you could just go and find out for yourselves.
For a lay person, she has a way of cutting through the crap.
Oh, my God!
It's a roomful of Dads!
- There he is!
- Oh, look at him holding court.
No wonder he likes it here.
They're hanging on his every word.
I've never seen him have such fun without a remote control.
Frasier, Niles!
I'm glad you could make it.
Meet some guys I was on the force with.
Meet my boys.
This is Frasier.
He's on the radio.
This is Marty's kid, the guy on the radio!
Hey, Frasier, Joe Herman, nice to meet you.
Check this out: "I'm listening.
" It's like a recording of myself.
- Dad.
- What?
Oh, this is my other son, Niles.
He's a psychiatrist, too.
- He married money!
- All right!
Duke, I want you to meet my boys.
This is Frasier and this is Niles.
How are you?
How about a couple of Duke's specials for you?
- What would those be?
- Boilermakers.
Shot of whisky.
Beer back.
We've been drinking those all night.
Time to switch to sherry.
Two boilermakers, please.
Marty's been telling us about you since you were kids.
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, Frasier, we felt terrible when we heard your wife was screwing around.
- What was her name again?
- Lilith!
Hey, it was a slow night, all right?
All right, everybody, settle down.
I want to make a toast.
For 30 years, Duke's has been my home away from home.
I look around and I see a lot of friends.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss this joint, too.
May there be a place in hell for those SOBs who are tearing it down to build a mini-mall!
Those snivelling, rat-faced bastards from Meadow Wood Properties!
To Duke's!
Two more!
- Did you talk to your lawyer.
- Yes.
He's examined the contract.
The general partner won't consider moving the site.
The deal's going through.
We could have Duke's declared a historical landmark.
No.
They tore down Seattle's first Pony Express office to build it.
- Damn!
- Here you go, guys.
One cappuccino, one latte and these are on me.
- This guilt is driving me crazy.
- It should.
You earn more than me.
- Duke's was his life.
- There's nothing we can do about it.
Look at it this way: we're doing Dad a service, stopping him from drinking.
And the other policemen as well.
Maybe it's a community service.
Men with guns will have one less place to liquor up.
There's always Roz's place.
What do you say about me when I'm not around?
I won't feel better till I tell Dad.
Oh, no.
It's like a woman who has one crazy night and cheats on her boyfriend.
Her only reason to confess is to make herself feel better.
So the best thing she can do is to keep her mouth shut.
Unless her boyfriend walks in, because he's flown home instead of driving like he said he would, in which case, he's the liar, so why should she feel bad?
Thank you, Roz, for that purely theoretical example.
I agree.
If we tell him now, it'll hurt him.
We've got to keep it quiet.
- I don't think it can be done.
- Of course it can!
You can look Dad in the eye, knowing you have destroyed his sanctuary?
You can live with that?
You forget.
I married Lilith.
I can live with anything.
You buy into an investment group, Eddie.
You don't know.
- Dad, what are you doing up?
- I reached out and Eddie wasn't there.
You need a woman, Dad.
Tell me about it.
Oh, you turned the sign on.
That was nice of Duke to give it to me.
You hold a glass of beer in front of it, it turns green.
Dad Niles and I invested in the company that's tearing down Duke's.
We tried to get out of it, but we couldn't.
Yell at me, Dad, will you?
Hit me with your cane.
Just don't stand there.
Let me see if I've got this right.
In the last year, you give my chair away, you lose my dog and now you demolish my bar.
Next I'll find out you're the one who shot me in the hip!
- I have an alibi for that one.
- You have one for everything.
It wasn't on purpose.
I'm part of an investment group.
You watched me and my friends get all weepy and didn't say anything.
What did you want us to say?
"Fellas, here's something ironic " Why didn't you at least tell me?
I don't know, I I guess Maybe it was because, when you invited me to Duke's, it felt like we were getting closer.
It was a momentous step.
- It was a beer!
- Not to me.
It was validation.
Finally, I was one of the guys you wanted to hang out with.
I didn't want to spoil that.
I'd have asked you before but I just figured it was the kinda place you'd look down your nose at.
Well, you're probably right.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
- Maybe I spent too much time there.
- What do you mean?
When you were growing up.
If I'd spent less time at Duke's and more with you, I wouldn't have a son who puts so much stock in one beer.
You know, I was having a pretty good time at Duke's.
Till I found I was responsible for wiping it off the face of the planet.
I liked having you there, too, son.
Thanks, Dad.
Do you mind?
It's driving me crazy.
It looks like hell.
Know what?
We got a few hours before the wrecking ball comes.
- How about you and I go down there?
- To Duke's?
- Yeah.
- Now?
- Yeah.
- You and me?
- Not this again!
- Yeah.
All right, great.
Just you, me and Charlie Ballantine.
Meet you right back here in a minute.
Oh, good evening, Daphne.
Or should I say good morning?
- How was your date with Derek?
- We had a wonderful time.
We went to dinner, then to the symphony, then we took a lovely moonlight stroll through the park.
He's the perfect gentleman.
Apparently in England, it's the fourth date.
# I'll be here # In sunshine or in shadow # Oh, Danny Boy, oh, Danny Boy # I love you so # That's good.
It reminds me of old Micky Dougan.
One 4th July, we were on mounted patrol in a big parade down Broad Street.
It was a scorcher.
Must have been 100%F.
I'm sitting on a thousand pounds of hot, sweaty horse.
I must have been complaining because, as we ride by Duke's, Micky says, "If you want a beer so bad, get one"!
So I ride through the front door, up to the bar and order a beer.
Duke plays it cool and says, "What'll your friend have"?
I say, "Nothing, he's driving.
" - I've told you that one before, haven't I?
- Yeah.
Oh, what a place!
- Another beer, Dad?
- Sure, why not?
Sun's up.
I look around this place in the golden early morning light It's still a dump.
I'm going to miss it, though.
I know what it is to have a neighbourhood bar.
I remember the last time I walked out of my old watering hole in Boston.
It was a strangely emotional day.
It's the people, I guess.
Saying goodbye to a lot of people.
Saying goodbye to this place doesn't mean you can't see your buddies as much as ever.
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, you're right.
But that's life.
You move on.
Only a fool tries to fight it.
- What are you doing?
- Stopping the demolition.
And you?
- Saying goodbye.
- You may not have to.
I intend to stand here and face down the bulldozers.
Niles, don't have to do that.
I've a discussion with Dad, he forgives us.
- Sure, Son.
Don't worry.
It's OK.
- Is it really?
I think not!
Because today it's Duke's, but tomorrow it's Mo's.
And the day after, it's Ernie's Taproom.
I'm not just here for you, Dad.
I'm doing this for every little guy who's found solace after a hard day by bellying up at his local bar.
I'll show faceless, corporate America they can't just shove the little guy aside.
Even when I'm that faceless, corporate America.
I'm here to fight the good fight, to show those rat-faced heathens there's still some fury in the heart of John Q Public.
On the other hand, who am I to stand in the way of progress?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Look at this.
My so-called windproof umbrella.
Look!
Look!
I'd have fared just as well with one of those paper ones.
I collect those.
They remind me of great evenings I can't remember.
- City College wants you to lecture.
- Fine.
Just tell me the date.
OK.
St Bartholomew's Hospital wants you at their benefit.
- Pass.
- Turning down a hospital?
Yes.
Don't look at me that way.
I'm with you.
I hate how whiny, sick people are always nagging.
"I want a magazine.
I want a kidney.
" Roz, I sympathise as much as you do, which is why I said yes last year.
I bought an Armani tuxedo, wrote a speech, put off a visit to Frederick.
Then they didn't need me.
Their first choice had become available.
The irrepressible Kathie Lee Gifford.
- Way to hold a grudge!
- This is not about spite.
This is about dignity, a rare and fragile thing.
Anything else?
- Judging the Miss Seattle Pageant?
- I'll do that.
- That's dignified.
- A scholarship is involved.
All right.
You're on in ten seconds.
Look, we have new sponsors.
Work this copy in as often as you can.
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
KACL 780.
It's a grey, depressing day in the Emerald City.
Let's hope we can brighten up your afternoon.
We hold it our duty to banish your rainy day blues.
First, a message from a new sponsor.
"Death is inevitable.
"But it's especially painful when it claims a beloved pet.
"If you've lost, or are planning to lose " a cherished dog, cat or bird, "let Pet Paradise console you with a memorial "bearing the likeness of your departed friend.
"Pet Paradise.
Though your pet may be small, your loss is great.
" - Who's our first caller, Roz?
- Edna.
She's a receptionist at a pest control firm.
She's depressed.
Hello, Edna.
I'm listening.
'Hello, Dr Crane.
I've worked in pest control for 15 years.
'I go in every day, answer the same calls, ask the same questions.
"'What kind of bugs?
Have you seen any droppings"?
'Then I go to the next person.
"What kind of bugs"?
' Edna, I can sense where this is going.
Even the most interesting life can become routine.
You need to shake up your world.
Find a new boyfriend, a new job, a new city.
- 'You mean, move?
' - Well There are easier places to cheer up than this dreary, soggy city of ours.
'Dr Crane, you're right.
I don't have to stay here.
'When you think about it, there's a whole world of vermin out there.
' Eloquently put, Edna.
Thank you.
Speaking of vermin "When that special rat of yours "turns its toes up for the last time, "don't forget your friends at Pet Paradise.
"Pet Paradise.
When a shoe box isn't enough.
" Another radiant morning.
What do you think, Dad?
Should I drive to work or hail a gondola?
I like rain.
It gets those squeegee guys off the street.
Now, stay put until I can dry off your feet.
There.
That ought to do it.
Daphne, get that hat off him.
Isn't it bad enough we had him neutered?
At this rate, I don't think I'm going to have children.
Just let me dress up the dog.
I've never seen him look that stupid.
You'll change your tune when you see his St Patrick's Day outfit.
Hey, Derek Mann mentioned you in his column.
"I listen to Frasier Crane because I'm trying to drop a few pounds.
"His voice is an effective appetite suppressant.
" - How witty.
- I thought so, too.
Give me that.
"Yesterday he advised an unhappy woman "that she could cure her depression by leaving Seattle.
"It would cure my depression if the Seattle-hating Dr Crane "would take his own advice and leave town.
" - Ludicrous!
I never said that.
- Yes, you did.
You said Seattle was dreary and she should leave town.
It was one of several suggestions taken out of context.
- Apologise.
- What for?
For insulting Seattle.
People take pride in it.
They don't want you telling them it's rainy and depressing.
If you hadn't noticed, it gets a bit damp here.
For God's sake, the state flower is mildew.
Listen, a city's like a woman.
Get one mad at you and it doesn't matter who's right.
You apologise or you'll be paying forever.
- I don't care for that analogy.
- I'm sorry.
I was way out of line.
All right, you're forgiven.
Dad, to you, everything is like a woman.
A fast car, a romantic song A good meat loaf is like a woman.
A city is not like a woman, it's like a city.
And I'm not apologising.
If you don't understand, Seattle does.
Seattle loves Frasier Crane.
- Hello, Father Mike.
- Hello.
Dr Crane was not bashing Seattle.
He was sincerely trying to help that woman.
Who's our sponsor?
Pet Paradise.
Go ahead and boycott them.
See how easy it is to flush your dead dog down the toilet.
Was that a complaint about the rain thing?
I've been on the phone all morning.
Forgive me.
I'll stick to subjects like suicide and stay away from controversial stuff like weather.
- Hello?
- Hey, Doc, I need some advice.
I feel a cold coming on.
Should I take vitamin C or leave Seattle?
I hope you're happy.
The switchboard has had over 50 irate calls.
The most I got was 35 on my commentary, "Lady umpires: finally a chest worth protecting.
" - Frasier, think about apologising.
- I would if I'd said anything wrong.
I've got half a dozen calls that say you did.
I don't want to talk to them.
I don't know how to break this to you, but it's a call-in show!
'How can you say Seattle is depressing?
'I've spent 40 years here, working the graveyard shift at a salmon cannery.
'And, let me tell you, you fatheaded moron, 'I'm the most cheerful person you'll ever meet.
' Certainly the most cheerful one I've met today.
Alas, we're out of time.
I'd like to say, as I've been saying for three hours, that it was not my intent to cause offence.
Since it seems obvious that I have, I would like to apologise.
I do not find Seattle depressing.
It would take more than clouds to obscure her beauty and more than drizzle to dampen the warmth and fellowship that make Seattle the only place I care to call home.
Till Monday, then, this is Dr Frasier Crane, signing off.
Good grief!
Have you ever heard such whiny, provincial crybabies?
This city has lost its rain-addled mind!
Dr Crane, we're still on the air.
Thank you, Roz.
Now, we're off.
I believe this goes here and that attaches there.
Are you sure you don't want me to try?
No, you might crack a nail or snag a cuticle.
- There.
Are we getting anything?
- Does annoyed count?
Hush.
If you hadn't bashed it with your cane when the Seahawks lost, we wouldn't need a new set.
Isn't there a manual?
Yes, but unfortunately, Stephen Hawking isn't here to explain it.
- I thought the winds had eased.
- They have.
- What happened to your umbrella?
- A listener recognised me.
He pulled it through a fence.
You would not believe the hostility, even at the Café Nervosa.
I thought I heard a new cappuccino maker, I saw three tables hissing!
- Don't answer it.
- I can't abide a ringing phone.
It's another crank.
They've been calling all day.
Oh, no!
They've got my number?
So, the phone rings.
We don't have to answer it.
Although it could be Frederick, or Grammy Moon to say her hip's out.
We can't be slaves to a bell.
Just because it's going ring ring ring!
or, in the case of a British phone, ring-ring ring-ring ring-ring ring-ring!
- Just answer it!
- Thank you!
Crane residence.
He can't come to the phone.
May I take a message?
Nice language, that!
I hope you don't eat with that mouth.
Daphne, excuse me.
How dare you speak to a lady that way!
Well, that's no excuse, ma'am.
Only cowards make threats by phone.
I dare you to say that to my face!
Never mind where I live.
Is anyone expecting visitors?
I suggest we all remain very quiet.
I have this image of angry villagers wielding torches and pitchforks.
- Frasier, open up!
It's Roz.
- It's worse than I thought.
- Why are you out in this weather?
- I called, but your line is busy.
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Martin.
How are you?
- Good.
- New TV?
Got it hooked up yet?
No.
I let Niles take a crack at it first.
God!
Martin, you're awful.
Frasier, the station manager came by.
If you can't smooth this over, he may have to suspend you.
- What would he put in my time slot?
- The best of Crane.
What will they do the second day?
How can I smooth it over?
This city is out to lynch me.
A guy cancelled on me cos I work for you.
You're alienating my boyfriends.
We can't afford to lose a demographic as large as that.
We need damage control.
It's not too late to call St Bart's Hospital and do their benefit.
- After the way they treated me?
- There will be lots of media.
It's a chance to redeem yourself.
- Listen to Roz.
- Dad!
- Take my advice.
- I did.
I apologised.
Oh, so sincerely!
You'll make a few jokes and self-deprecating remarks, help sick people and show you can laugh at yourself.
- I think it's a brilliant suggestion.
- Niles, did you compliment me?
Indeed I did.
You're very sawy, Roz.
You remind me of those amoral PR flacks who sell their services to industries that pollute.
- You think it's a good idea?
- It worked for Nancy Reagan.
She was widely criticised for lavish spending, so she appeared at a dinner in thrift store clothes and performed "Second Hand Rose".
- That made people like her again?
- Yes, briefly.
Tell them I'll MC.
Better yet, I'll take a table at the banquet.
I have.
Give the nuns 800 bucks.
- 800!
- Don't mess with them.
I'm in a precarious position.
I must choose my material carefully.
- I know some good jokes.
- No, Niles.
You don't.
If you need jokes, use some of mine.
Oh, yes.
I'm sure the nuns would love that.
And I'll ask call Bulldog and ask for a couple of limericks.
I'll call Father Mike.
I'm sure he knows some inoffensive jokes.
Hello.
Yes, well, I don't care how you feel.
I want to use the phone right now.
Your grandmother's hip is out.
Just kidding!
Kidding!
I do hope you'll have some humorous stories for us, though, of course, nothing too racy or risqué.
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- Good.
Last year, Kathie Lee Gifford told a most unfortunate story involving newlyweds and a ski lift.
Hello, all.
Thank you for coming out for such a good cause.
St Bart's did my hip surgery.
They treated me good.
I just saw Frasier.
He seems nervous.
There's a lot riding on this.
Thank goodness he's got that sweet old nun there to comfort him.
She's not sweet.
It's Sister Joselia, the scrubbing nun.
- "The Terror of Ward Three".
- You still remember her?
You know the nightmare where I scream, "Not the sponge"!
?
That's her!
- As a girl, I considered being a nun.
- What changed your mind?
I didn't want to work weekends.
- Where did Maris go?
- Mrs Crane is over there.
She's cornered Lydia Beaumont, head of the museum board.
- Maris wants to get on the board.
- Lydia's getting away.
The "freshen-the-drink" ploy.
Lydia has no idea with whom she's dealing.
Chug that sherry, Maris.
On with the chase!
Yes!
She's gaining!
It's Mrs Beaumont and Maris And yes!
They meet again.
They'll be board-mates before the dessert.
- Evening, everyone.
- We were saying you look confident.
- Really?
- Absolutely!
Forehead.
- You memorise the jokes I gave you?
- Yes.
That's why I look so confident.
Shouldn't they have started?
We're waiting for the Bishop who's introducing me.
He'll be here any minute.
Break a leg.
Remember, keep smiling and look like you're having a good time.
- Right.
- If a joke bombs, pay no attention.
Do what Johnny Carson did, make a joke about it.
"Bomb-o"!
Boy, I miss that guy!
Your dad's right.
Go up and be confident.
I will, after I find a men's room.
- It's butterflies in your stomach.
- Not for long!
I'll be back.
Good evening.
I'm Father Mike Mancuso and I've just been asked to make a very sad announcement.
Every year, our speaker has been introduced by Bishop Cologie, our chairman and host of the cable TV show "Pancakes and Parables".
We've just heard that the Bishop has had a terrible accident.
He was out fishing this afternoon when his boat was hit by a storm and capsized.
At the moment, he remains missing.
I'll keep you informed.
Why does everything happen to Frasier?
Devastated as we are, we know what this evening means to the Bishop and how he'd delight in entertaining us with his biblical hand shadows.
We also know he would be the first to insist that we proceed without him.
So, I'm going to step in and introduce our speaker.
Won't you extend a cordial and gracious welcome to my friend and colleague, Dr Frasier Crane.
Dr Crane?
Dr Crane?
Ah!
Thank you very much, Father Mike.
It's an honour to be here.
I expected the Bishop to introduce me but I'm sure he'll drift in soon.
It's a real comfort to see so many priests out in the audience.
I don't dare speak in public without someone standing by who can perform the last rites.
Whoa!
Very religious crowd, I see.
I can tell because of the vow of silence.
Got some holy water, Father?
I'm dying here.
And speaking of water, that reminds me of a little story.
A rabbi, a minister and a priest are all sitting at the bar on the Titanic.
Dr Crane!
The Bishop!
I heard the story with a priest, but what the heck?
A bishop's funnier!
Thank you, Sister.
OK, then A rabbi, a minister and a bishop are at the bar when the purser rushes in with the news Frasier, the Bishop is lost at sea!
Are you telling this story or am I?
- Frasier - I work alone, lady, all right?
Anyway, the purser rushes in with the horrible news about the boat.
The rabbi says, "My people need me.
" The minister is leaving when the priest says Sorry, the bishop says, "Have another drink.
The rabbi can handle it.
" The minister says, "You abandon your flock when we've hit an iceberg"?
The bishop says, "An iceberg?
I thought he said we hit a Weisberg"!
Hello?
Is this thing on?
Bomb-o!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Quiet.
It's starting.
'This is a political announcement for Holden Thorpe.
' You dragged us here to see Thorpe?
He's a fascist, like Himmler without the whimsy.
'Another American for Holden Thorpe.
' 'I'm Marty Crane.
' - Dear God!
- 'For 30 years I was a cop.
'Then I was shot by an assassin who wouldn't have been free 'if it weren't for the bleeding hearts in Congress.
'I used to carry a gun.
Now I carry a cane.
'I'm voting for Holden Thorpe.
He's running because I can't.
' - Well?
- I don't know what to say.
- I'm in a state of shock!
- Aren't we all?
You were wonderful.
This calls for a celebration.
- What'll you have?
- Give me a beer.
Dad, how did this happen?
I was in the park, there was a rally for Thorpe.
I talked to his people, told them I was an ex-cop and they shoved a camera in my face.
- They're exploiting you.
- No, they're not.
I like Thorpe.
How could you support that odious hose-head?
He once said, "Cancer aside, tobacco is good for the economy.
" He's for more cops on the street.
It can't hurt, now everyone's armed.
We don't have many guns in England.
You don't need guns.
You've got kidney pie.
Hello.
- It's Duke.
- Oh!
- Sherry?
- I couldn't, Niles.
I'm too upset.
I'm glad you liked it.
I've got a lot of showbiz secrets to tell you.
They can make you cry on cue by pulling a hair out of your nose.
What?
Really?
Guys, quick!
Channel 14!
My other spot!
This one was my idea.
Remember Lyndon Johnson showing his scar?
'Hi, I'm Marty Crane.
'Crime isn't pretty.
If you don't believe me, look at this.
' - Can I help you?
- What's on today?
- Kenyan blend.
- No, no, no.
They still poach elephants.
What else?
- Dark roast Brazilian.
- Not till they stop rain forest loss.
- Salvadoran?
- Not with their human rights record.
We're down to the Hawaiian Cona blend.
Or have they slaughtered too many macadamia nuts?
That'll be fine, thank you.
- Niles.
- I can't stand it.
I just walked by a store with 22 TV sets in the window showing Dad's butt.
I saw it.
I don't know what's worse - seeing his butt, or what it stands for.
I just can't believe our father is actually endorsing that self-serving fear-monger.
I've given this a lot of thought and I realise Dad isn't the problem.
He's supporting his candidate.
The problem lies with us.
- Us?
We've done nothing.
- Exactly.
"For evil to triumph requires only that good men do nothing.
" - Edmund Burke.
- I have that quotation framed.
I mean to put it in my office but keep forgetting.
Anyway, the time has come for you and me to get involved.
How?
Support Thorpe's opponent, Phil Patterson.
- I'm voting for Patterson.
- I had something more in mind.
I spoke to some people at Patterson's headquarters.
They'd like you to do a TV endorsement.
Niles, I'd love to help, but you must realize that, as a radio psychiatrist, I can't take the chance of alienating my listeners.
People needing help might be put off if they knew my politics.
Think about it.
A candidate like this doesn't come often.
He's hard working, he volunteers at a soup kitchen.
He cares about people.
He believes in what we believe in.
- Buy chocolates, send a kid to camp.
- Can't you see we're talking?
Thank you for your call, Susan.
We'll be back after this message.
'Crime: it's epidemic.
It strikes fast and it can strike you.
'I'm Holden Thorpe.
Send me to Washington because ' it's better than having you here.
He makes it sound like it's either vote for him or be found murdered in bed.
I wouldn't worry, Roz.
What are the chances of finding you there alone?
- Sports fan, how they hanging?
- OK.
I was talking to Roz.
Ten seconds.
'Vote for me.
My programme gives the streets back to the people.
' That's good.
With your tax programme that's where they'll be sleeping.
We'll be back for one more call after this newsbreak.
Then, next up, Bob Bulldog Brisco and the Gonzo Sports Show.
- I've asked you not to do that.
- Way to be impartial, Doc.
Thorpe's a good man.
You voting for that pretty boy Patterson?
He's great.
His reapportionment plan makes sense.
Forget it.
He's happily married.
So is Thorpe.
His wife's a cow, he still loves her.
- There's a bumper sticker.
- Back in a minute.
I liked your shot at Thorpe.
Our next caller disagrees.
Really?
Put him on.
I welcome contrasting viewpoints.
Hello, Seattle.
Roz, who is on the line?
On line one, we have Holden Thorpe.
- Go ahead, caller.
- 'Crane?
Thorpe.
- 'Let me ask you, are you married?
' - Divorced.
- 'Did you ever serve in the military?
' - I have congenitally weak ankles.
'I see.
So a guy like you - unmarried, didn't serve his country - 'criticizes a patriotic family man who fought in the battle of Grenada.
- 'I went in on the first wave.
' - On a surfboard, I suppose.
'When the likes of you are off the radio, 'America will be a nice, friendly place to live again.
' You've said your piece; now listen to mine.
Hang up, will you?
You may not listen, but Seattle will hear me out.
They won't.
The show ended five seconds ago.
Oh, hello, there.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
You may know me from my radio show.
Today, I'm speaking as a concerned citizen.
As a mental health expert, I've been listening to Phil Patterson.
I like the way his mind works.
He's a visionary who cares about the little people.
That's why I'm proud to say I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress.
Thanks, Frasier.
Together, we can live the dream.
Phil Patterson: the sane choice.
OK, give us five minutes to adjust the lights and we'll shoot.
Yes, adjust those lights.
They need to be lighter and brighter.
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Our pleasure.
The Cranes have a history of political involvement.
My wife has all our servants at your campaign HQ licking envelopes.
She'd do it herself, but the poor thing can't produce saliva.
- Hello.
- You agreed to keep him out.
You know how he gets.
He whines and whimpers until you can't stand it.
Don't let them talk about you like that.
She was talking about me.
- Hi.
Marty Crane.
- Phil Patterson.
You look familiar but I can't place you.
- Let me give you a hint.
- Dad!
I'm just trying to help the guy!
He did a commercial for your opponent.
Yes.
It came back to me.
Hello.
Daphne Moon.
My uncle was a political writer for a London tabloid.
I remember his biggest scoop.
The headline read: "High-ranking politician caught in women's clothing.
" On page two you found out it was Margaret Thatcher, but by then you'd bought the paper.
- Thank you, Miss Moon.
- It's a little hot.
- Want to step out on the balcony?
- Great.
- Oh, beautiful view.
- Thank you.
Yes, I feel very lucky living here.
And I feel lucky to be a part of your campaign, as well.
It's me who's lucky.
It's a boost to get an endorsement from you.
- My name doesn't carry much weight.
- People love you.
I've listened to your show.
To tell the truth, I've even thought of calling in.
Really?
What for?
Oh, it's kind of sensitive.
Listen, Phil, as a psychiatrist, anything you tell me will be in confidence.
It's funny how, the more you bottle things up inside, the bigger they seem to be.
Well, I've never told anybody this before but OK, here goes.
Six years ago, I was abducted by aliens.
Aliens?
They took me to their spaceship for a conference.
They're concerned about our planet.
Hey, you were right.
Now I've said it out loud, it's doesn't seem like that big a deal.
No.
They're ready, gentlemen.
Let's elect a Congressman!
Frasier?
Frasier?
Roll it.
And Action.
Hello.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
You may know me from my radio show, but today, I'm speaking as a concerned citizen.
A deeply concerned citizen.
As a mental health expert, I've been listening to what my good friend, Phil Patterson, has to say.
I like the way his mind works.
He's a visionary who cares about the "little people".
That's why I'm proud to say that I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress.
Thanks, Frasier.
Together, we can live the dream.
Phil Patterson the sane choice.
- OK, cut!
- God, I'm burning up!
You were nervous.
Take a few minutes and we'll try again.
I got mine on the first take!
Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
What's going on?
I've something to get off of my chest but I'd be violating doctor-patient confidence.
Nothing is more sacrosanct than professional ethics.
Fortunately, I know a trick to get around them.
I'll be your psychiatrist.
Then you can spill your guts with impunity.
It's borderline, but I'm desperate.
Just now, on the balcony, Phil Patterson told me he had been abducted by aliens.
Apparently, he was beamed up to the mother ship for a little interplanetary chitchat.
This is bad, isn't it?
Niles, it's awful.
We'll look like such idiots!
We?
It was your idea to get into politics.
My idea?
I can't believe you have the gall to tell me I wanted to stop you.
This isn't getting us anywhere.
Put that away!
All right.
What are we going to do?
Convince Phil to drop out and seek help.
- If he drops out, Thorpe wins.
- Forget it!
- Then forget education and the arts.
- I should still back Phil?
Can you tell me with certainty, in such a vast universe, there isn't intelligent life elsewhere?
At present, I'm not sure there is intelligent life in this kitchen!
Assume it's in his imagination.
How often does he see them?
Only once.
Which suggests it was brought on by overwork, rather than a paranoid delusion.
- My diagnosis exactly.
- Phil deserves his chance.
- He still needs professional help.
- Yes!
The best there is.
- But we won't turn our backs on him.
- No.
So will you treat him?
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker!
It's time I got my eyebrows waxed.
I'm getting that Romanian peasant look.
- It doesn't help that I haven't slept.
- Dating a snorer?
I'm getting tired of your constant insinuation that I sleep around.
I didn't sleep 'cause of Chopper Dave.
When he's bored with traffic reports, he likes to buzz people's apartments in his helicopter.
- Annoying.
- It didn't bother me.
But the guy I was with is a Vietnam vet and he had flashbacks.
Greetings, losers!
Heard the news?
One of your overpaid idols passed his urine test?
Laugh, but word's out about Patterson and his aliens.
- My God!
- It's all over TV.
- How did they find out?
- You can't keep this quiet.
Every station is serving his heart on a platter.
It's just like the media to find a flaw to ruin a career.
I have a conduit to the public ear.
- I won't let Phil go without a fight!
- What aliens?
Patterson's got two illegal aliens from Guatemala working in his house.
No green cards, no documents, no chance!
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I have just learned that it has become public knowledge that Phil Patterson believes in aliens from outer space.
Not only that, he believes he has met them, that he was beamed aboard their spaceship for a chat.
Shocked?
Well, all right.
But let's ask ourselves these questions.
Does this harmless delusion, most likely brought on by overwork and sleep deprivation, adversely affect his voting record?
I say no!
What leader doesn't have quirks?
Reagan saw astrologers.
Patton believed in reincarnation.
Even Hoover let his slip show once in a while.
People, this is a great leader.
We shouldn't consider minor eccentricities.
What's important, what really counts, is what's in here.
I'm pointing at my chest now.
'The results are in.
Holden Thorpe is elected 'with a whopping 92% of the vote.
' At least Mr Patterson got 8%.
They must have counted absentee votes from planet Krypton.
Now, Dr Crane.
It wasn't all your fault.
Those Guatemalans would have cost him votes anyway.
Those Guatemalans were exchange students.
Phil gave them room and board to show goodwill between countries.
I'd like to stay and gloat, but I've got to change to go to the celebration at Thorpe HQ.
You're welcome to tag along.
You're quite a hero down there!
No, thank you!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
When will I learn it hurts when I do that?
- Oh.
Phil.
Come on in.
- Hi, Frasier.
Thank you.
Just came by to return this good-luck tie you loaned me.
I saw you wearing it for your concession speech.
A little embarrassing, having to do it before lunch.
But it gave me time to pick up my dry cleaning.
- I am so sorry.
- It's OK.
- You thought you were defending me.
- Seattle deserves better than Thorpe.
That's politics.
It's just one election.
- I'll be back.
- You really think you can?
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I believe anything's possible.
Phil.
I've got to ask you Do you really believe it happened?
I honestly wish I could say it didn't, but it did.
I guess you'll never believe it unless it happens to you.
So, what's next for you?
Maybe I'll run in California.
A thing like this could actually help me there.
Anything's possible.
Oh, very funny, Chopper Dave!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hi, we're back.
We have Chester on the line.
- How can I help you?
- 'I don't know.
'I've had a lot of fights with my wife lately.
She feels I'm wasting my life.
' - Spinning your wheels?
- 'Huh?
I don't follow.
' This problem might be too complex for the few seconds remaining.
Call tomorrow.
I'll make sure you get on first thing.
- 'It's tough to get through.
' - Tell you what.
When I get off the air, I'll pick up and try to help.
Take your time.
I've got to scoot.
Bulldog's up after the news with the Gonzo Sports Show on "What's wrong with our Seattle Mariners"?
If you haven't commented on that in the last 18 years, do it today!
So long, all.
- That was a pretty good show.
- Mm-hmm.
- What's that?
- "Seattle Magazine".
The hottest hundred men and women in town.
- Let me see!
- What about Chester?
You heard him - he can wait.
- You're not in there.
- Oh.
- Niles isn't in there, either.
- Cool!
Oh, my!
Who is this fresh angel?
- Madeline Marshall, No 47.
- Makes her own line of sportswear.
She's a stunning woman!
"Single, patron of the arts, MBA at Stanford.
" Well, if you have to go to school on the West Coast "What she looks for most in a man: "someone who knows how to listen.
" Roz, I'm in love!
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Yeah, right!
- What have you got to lose?
- She doesn't even know who I am.
- You're on the radio.
- Then why am I not in there?
Those are important people.
- I'm going to call her office.
- No!
- Hey, Doc!
- Bulldog.
Just did an hour on the Stairmaster.
What do you think?
Like a couple of cherry tomatoes, huh?
Thank you.
You've just put me off salads for a month.
- What have we got here?
- Is Madeline Marshall there?
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- You know this Madeline Marshall?
No.
I found her attractive and Roz insisted on calling her.
Small wonder.
Smart, sophisticated And I like a woman who doesn't wear underwear.
- She's wearing a business suit.
- It was a general comment.
Hi.
Miss Marshall?
Could you please hold for Dr Crane?
Thank you.
Oh, all right.
Once more unto the breach.
Hello.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I know we've never met, but you seem like a fascinating person.
I was just wondering Would you be so good as to have dinner with me tonight?
That's very gracious of you to accept, Chester, but I didn't mean you.
- Roz, you could have said line two!
- You could have asked.
Mr Crane, is the proper term "serial killer" or "serial murderer"?
- "Serial killer".
Why?
- Letting Mum know what's going on.
She worries if she doesn't hear from me.
How about a nice Havana with that wine?
Thank you!
- Aren't Cuban cigars illegal?
- I've got a friend in Customs.
He confiscated them from a teacher who "needed them for a lesson".
When are people going to learn that rules apply to everyone?
I love to see a man with a cigar.
It reminds me of my grandfather.
All day, he'd sit with a great big stogey dangling from his lips.
The hours we used to spend on his lap, playing with the yellow whiskers beneath his nose.
He'd take out his teeth with the cigar in them and chase us.
We'd all laugh and laugh.
Then suddenly his mood would change, and we'd all have to run for our lives.
You can't buy memories like that.
Eddie, I know you took the socks that go with this suit.
Where are they?
Brown socks with a blue suit?
I think not.
Try again.
Thank you.
- Where are you off to?
- He has a blind date.
- Really?
With whom?
- Madeline Marshall.
She has her own sportswear concern.
According to "Seattle Magazine", she is the 47th hottest person in Seattle.
- That article was a sham.
- Not in it, huh?
Can you believe it?
Well, I'm off.
You know, I have a good feeling about tonight.
I have a song in my heart, a dance in my step and dog saliva around my ankles.
Thank you.
This is wonderful!
I've never heard of this place.
You're in for a treat.
"Degas" is the pinnacle of French country dining.
Ettienne Degas, his wife and daughter, will treat us like family.
I couldn't help being flattered when you said you knew my show.
Are you a devoted listener?
Actually, my secretary listens to it but I try to catch what I can when I cross through her office.
Bonsoir.
Welcome to "Degas".
Our special tonight is our fabulous crispy duck.
Oh, yummy!
And a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape '89.
The only one in that decade to outdo the '88.
Excellent choice.
- You know wine.
- I acquaint myself with fine things.
What would you like to know about me?
For starters, why is a man as charming as you still out there?
Well, actually, I - I'm recently divorced.
- Thank goodness.
I thought you were one of those single men still living with his parents!
Yeah.
Your heart really has to go out to those sad sacks.
- I'm divorced also.
- We have so much in common.
- I caught him with my sister.
- Fabulous!
- The same thing happened to me.
- Boy, my sister gets around.
You've kept your sense of humour.
Yeah, but it isn't easy to get over, is it?
No.
No, it's not.
Those nights when you ask yourself, "How could this have happened?
Was I insensitive"?
- "Was I a workaholic"?
- "Was I not good enough in bed"?
You reach for anything.
What are you telling me?
You are pregnant?
Maman, I told you he would do this!
Who is the father?
I want to know!
I won't tell you!
When I find him, I'll kill him.
I'll snap his neck like a stale baguette!
- Your wine.
- Yes, that's the one.
I will just go and open it.
- This will be a night to remember.
- Oh, yes.
Are you going to tell me?
No!
There's a clam house up the road.
No, I think we're getting the most for our entertainment buck right here.
What did I ever see in you?
You don't think I'm sick of you?
You and your cuttlefish bisque!
I spit in your cuttlefish bisque!
Voilà.
It's a delicacy from our little village in France.
Cuttlefish bisque.
What are the odds?
I had cuttlefish for lunch.
You can leave my house, Yvette!
Go to wherever he is!
Are you not the one who gives advice on the radio?
- You listen to my show?
- No, but my Sous-chef does.
I hear you as I walk through the kitchen.
Monsieur, you must help me!
Ettienne!
If everyone comes out, how will you know when our duck is crispy?
- This is the doctor from the radio.
- Ah, oui!
You must talk to my husband.
He does not understand that these things happen.
Talk to this tramp!
Do you believe my daughter?
You should meet my sister.
- I wasn't pregnant when we got married!
- I wish I had been killed in the war!
It's hard to get killed when you run away!
Silence!
Silence!
Both of you try to calm down.
I'll see what I can do.
Monsieur Degas, you are angry now.
That is a temporary emotion.
You are devastated because you think the bond between father and daughter is broken.
She is no longer your little girl.
But that's not possible.
That bond cannot be broken.
Not even by that young man in the corner who is obviously the father.
Come out!
It's all right.
We need more water.
You?
You can't even get water in a glass!
How did you do this?
Monsieur Degas, please.
Hold your daughter in your arms.
Tell her how you really feel.
Yvette Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you!
You are a god!
And you, mademoiselle, are very lucky.
I'm starting to realise that.
Just another evening out with Dr Frasier Crane.
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey.
Again, thank you.
It's OK.
You've thanked me every day for the last two weeks.
But if it hadn't been for you, I never would have met Madeline.
We went out again last night.
It's perfect between us!
We talk, laugh Just stop.
Did it ever occur to you that, since I'm in a dating drought, to hear you prattling on about your storybook romance might be a bit irritating?
No, it hadn't.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive.
But Madeline's helping me with that.
She is so good.
- God!
- Sorry.
I haven't felt this way since my divorce.
Everything seems so right!
You know, I haven't said this out loud, but here goes.
She could be the woman I spend the rest of my life with.
Go.
Go do that!
Get married.
Have a couple of kids.
Move to the country.
Buy a puppy.
Live happily ever after!
Just don't tell me about it!
I need a boyfriend.
Dear Roz.
Dear, silly Roz.
Dear, silly, horny Roz.
- Look!
It's - That must be Madeline.
Madeline, hi!
Hi, Roz, Madeline!
Madeline, Roz!
What a surprise to see you!
I have a meeting with a buyer nearby in ten minutes and I wanted to talk to you.
Please, have a seat.
You know we both agreed we didn't want to rush into the physical part, that we'd save ourselves for the right moment.
It's now?
No, actually.
I was wondering what you thought about us going away for the weekend, just the two of us.
Well, I'd miss my favourite shows, but sure.
I was thinking two, three days.
I was thinking more like a week.
OK, now for the really big question: when?
Well, the minute we get there.
No.
Actually, I meant, when do we go?
Oh, oh, yes.
Let's see.
Now, let's see, I am good for the week of the 16th.
The 16th No.
Sweeps week.
- How about the 23rd?
- No.
No.
Trade show.
30th?
- No.
- That puts us into the next month.
No.
No.
No.
The 20th?
No.
We're both obviously too busy.
We'll do it another time.
- Yes, I - I've got to run.
- Let's go tomorrow!
- You're on!
- The perfect place is Bora Bora.
- Hubba hubba!
- I'll arrange it!
- I'll meet you at the airport!
- Bye!
- Bye.
Oh, Madeline Bye.
Hello.
You don't know me, but I saw your picture in "Seattle Magazine".
They don't write songs like that any more.
This is really what men do, isn't it, Dad?
Yeah, this and some things outdoors, but we'll just stick to this.
These last few nights have been very pleasant, you and me sitting together, appreciating these fine cigars.
Who would have thought a Cuban peasant would bring a father and son together?
Yes.
Must make that dime he gets for a day's work a lot more satisfying.
I'm going to miss these little sweethearts.
- Ooh, now, there's a talent!
- I'll say!
- Just how do you do that?
- It's simple.
It's all in the tongue.
Just purse your lips and pucker up like a little goldfish.
That's it.
Just like that.
Very good.
Have you got it?
- Niles, what are you doing?
- I'm learning how to blow smoke.
Where?
- I asked you to smoke on the balcony.
- It's cold.
All right.
Maybe an errant ash will flick off and ignite your chair.
What's the matter?
Madeline and I are going to Bora Bora.
Why do bad things happen to good people?
- When did this come about?
- About an hour ago.
We got caught up in a moment of passion and now I'm going halfway around the world with a woman I hardly know.
It isn't like me.
I'm getting caught up in the romance.
I'm not sure about the psychological side, but it seems good to me.
But what if we hate each other and we're stuck together?
That won't happen.
You'll come back even more in love.
Even worse!
If it goes perfectly, we'll start talking about commitment and living together and marriage and Your trepidation is well founded.
You can move a relationship along too fast and marry too hastily and then find a few years down the line she isn't right for you.
Then what happens if you meet the right person?
You can't act upon it because you're trapped in a stale Maris.
Marriage.
I have to go now.
Did you feel a spark when you met this woman?
- Like fireworks.
- Then go for it.
It doesn't happen often.
It's like when I met your mother at a crime scene.
Hester was a psychiatrist.
The department would have her run up a profile of a suspect.
The first time I met her was over the chalk outline of a murder victim.
One look at her hair silhouetted against the flashing blue light and I was a goner.
She drew a smile on the head of the outline and I drew eyes and soon we were laughing like kids.
You're a ghoul.
I was joking.
We couldn't draw on the outline.
They hadn't moved the body.
Your corpse-strewn romance notwithstanding, I still feel skittish about this.
Dr Crane, if you'd like a feminine point of view, just shut your bloody cakehole and go!
You took a chance and called her, and you've been happy ever since.
- That is true.
- Yeah, so make another bold move.
- Yeah, go on!
- You won't regret it.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Attaboy!
That's terrific!
I know you just want me out of the house for a week.
It will be sweet, won't it?
Thank you.
This is gorgeous!
I'm so glad you suggested it.
It's more beautiful than I remember.
The natives say that Bora Bora is the doorway to heaven.
This could be the doorway to heaven for us.
I'm glad you said that first.
I didn't want it to seem like our trip was just about sex, but who are we kidding?
- I'm a little hot in these clothes.
- I'm sweating like a pig.
- I'll be right back.
- Oink.
Frasier.
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?
Oh, my God!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
'I just opened up the pages of "Seattle" magazine and there she was.
' Oh, my!
Who is this fresh angel?
Madeline Marshall?
Would you be so good as to have dinner with me tonight?
I was wondering about us going away for the weekend.
I'm in love.
'So off I flew to Bora Bora, and did I receive the shock of my life?
' Frasier.
- Oh, my God!
- Frasier?
Oh, my God!
- Lilith, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes Come out and join us, Madeline.
Are you here with someone?
Yes.
He's snorkelling at the moment.
- Anyone I know?
- Sam Malone.
Sam?
- Just kidding.
- Why did you bring him here?
It was spectacular five years ago when you brought me.
But this was our place.
How could you bring someone else?
Lilith, I'd like you to meet Madeline Marshall.
How's this for a hoot?
This is my ex-wife, Lilith.
- Your ex-wife is here?
- Yes.
What a shame, too: no papers to be signed.
- So you're here with someone?
- Why does everyone keep asking that?
Here he comes now.
Brian?
Dr Brian Patchett, I'd like you to meet Madeline Marshall and Dr Frasier Crane.
- Your ex-husband?
You're joking.
- No, God is.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.
Brian is a seismologist at MIT.
Perfect, Brian being a seismologist and you having so many faults.
Lilith, you're laughing!
I laugh a lot these days, thanks to Brian.
Madeline is just hilarious.
She also designs her own line of sportswear.
I don't think I've ever worn sportswear.
So, how long are you staying?
Until Tuesday.
We're here till Wednesday.
This has the potential to be very awkward.
Why don't we defuse the situation by having cocktails later?
- Let's have dinner.
- Wonderful idea!
- Let's meet in the Tiki room at six.
- Great.
Looking forward to it.
A wonderful way to start out what promises to be a great week.
- You see how Mr Perfect rubbed it in?
- Relax.
Climbing a tree to get a coconut when there were three on the ground!
Would you stop obsessing?
Come here.
OK.
- Hold it.
What's that?
- What?
Lilith is making love.
- I don't hear a thing.
- Exactly!
Would you just concentrate on me, please?
You're right.
It's not like in college when that went on in the next room and I was all alone with my Henry Miller collection.
I've just got to block it out of my mind, focus on the task at hand.
Oh, that's sexy.
You're right.
Forgive me.
You want sexy?
I'll show you sexy.
- I feel dirty.
- Good.
No, I mean sandy, from sitting on the beach.
Just let me take a shower.
OK.
Don't be long.
Then I'll make you forget you were ever married to Lilith.
That's never happened before without a prescription.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah.
Ohh!
It's never been like this before!
Never!
Nothing!
Damn her!
She can give as good as she gets!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Ohh!
Oh, Mama!
Oh, God!
You are so hot!
I am burning up!
That's it!
That's it!
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, my God, yes!
Keep it up, baby!
Oh, you're killing me!
Oh, God, you're an animal!
Yes!
Yes!
Obviously you don't need me.
Before we go to Chopper Dave for a traffic report, I'd like to send this message to Madeline M. I'm sure your gentleman would love an opportunity to explain his behaviour, but you left the island before he had a chance and you won't return his calls or answer his notes.
We all know how hard it is to find love in this world and what a tragedy it is to let it slip through our fingers.
I think he really cares about you.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
We'll be back in a moment.
- You were wonderful!
- You think she'll call?
- If she doesn't, she has no heart.
- Thank you, Roz.
I almost forgot.
This bill came for you from your hotel in Bora Bora.
I guess they had to charge me for the whole week.
No, that's for the bed you trashed.
$2,500 for bamboo?
Hello?
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Roz, whom do we have next?
We have Vic from Seattle on line three.
- Hello, Vic.
I'm listening.
- 'Hi.
Thanks for taking my call.
- 'I'm a little nervous.
' - Just relax, Vic.
- I'm listening.
- 'I have a problem with women.
' Frasier, Madeline's on line one.
'Dr Crane?
' Vic, something's come up in the booth.
I'll have to turn you over to my capable producer.
Madeline, hi!
Thanks for calling.
No, it's OK.
I'm off the air now.
So, Vic, what's your problem with women?
'I don't know.
I have a good job, a good personality, I think.
'I made more money as a model, but I'm doing OK at the law firm.
' Tell me more.
Maris is thrilled you're seeing the ballet.
- We're delighted.
- Yeah.
When I was younger, I dreamed of being a ballerina.
So did Maris.
But she could never get her weight up.
That's why I bought this walk-on part at the fundraiser as a gift for Maris.
- So Maris is going to be a ballerina?
- It's non-dancing, but a key role.
She plays Ulrich, the hunchbacked drawbridge operator.
I hope we can pick her out.
- What are you still doing here?
- We'll be gone before she gets here.
- You don't want to be late.
- I do.
With those ballet guys in tight pants, I don't know where to look.
That reminds me.
I've got to bring my binoculars.
- Will you just get out of here?
- Frasier, relax.
This is my last chance.
It serves me right after Bora Bora.
You're being too hard on yourself.
How were you to know Lilith was there?
Aside from the seas starting to churn and all the birds taking flight.
Don't worry.
Miss Marshall will forgive you.
Women appreciate a man who's sensitive enough to try again.
That's why they call us "the fair sex".
All right, then, let's go see some leaping Russian stags.
- Oh, hi, Maddie!
- Hello.
- We were just leaving.
- Come in.
You two kids take your time.
We'll be out all evening.
You know how it is: first the ballet, then the inevitable discussion.
- That was a little awkward, huh?
- So is this.
I'd better launch into my little speech to explain why I behaved the way I did.
No, I'll tell you how I've got it worked out: when you saw Lilith, you wanted to leave, but I wouldn't let you.
You said you couldn't handle it and, by God, you were right.
You panicked and your panic took a bad turn.
A spectacularly bad turn.
That's how I've got it worked out.
It's fragile, so don't mess with it.
So, why don't you mix up a pitcher of Mai Tais and give me a kiss?
I'll let you guess which I want first.
Guess again.
Delicious.
I love mangoes.
We never got round to sampling them on the islands.
- So I thought we should now.
- Good thinking.
There's something else we never got around to in Bora Bora.
You got around to it.
I just watched.
How about a little audience participation this time?
Frasier, wait.
I want this as much as you, but I need to talk to you first.
What?
I thought I was comfortable with this and wouldn't have to bring it up.
I was involved with a divorced man before.
Just when I was falling for him, he reconciled with his ex-wife.
I can't go through that again.
It's all right, Madeline.
Trust me.
Lilith and I are completely finished.
She lives on the other side of the country.
Except in matters of our son, we don't have contact.
That's all I wanted to hear.
Well, what's your name, little fellow?
You promise you won't laugh?
The dog His name is Eddie.
Come on.
Pardon me while I put him back where he belongs.
I'll be waiting.
Oh, God!
It's nice to see you, too.
Is Frasier here?
- Don't you live in Boston?
- I'm here on a layover.
And, judging by Frasier's trademark mangoes on a stick, so are you.
If you like, I can come back in ten minutes.
- That won't be necessary.
- I apologise for being inopportune.
We've agreed to make time for each other if we have something urgent to discuss.
Take all the time you need.
This whole thing's just a little too complicated for me.
Put down that mango, my dear.
It's time you tasted the forbidden fruit.
- Lilith!
What are you doing here?
- I have something urgent to discuss.
What have you done with Madeline?
She was surprised to see me and left.
I hope you're not angry.
Angry?
What do I have to be angry about?
I carve out a slice of happiness for myself and you obliterate it.
I'd drive a stake through your heart, but I don't think it could kill you.
- Brian asked me to marry him.
- What?
He wants to stop in Las Vegas on our way home.
- You're getting married?
- Yes.
Well So am I. - Really?
- Yes, yes, to Madeline.
She seemed in an awful hurry for someone who's getting married.
She had to buy a dress.
Oh, God, what am I doing?
- I'm not getting married.
- Wow, you really had me going.
Frasier, I don't want to disrupt anything.
I just came to get your blessing.
I could have given it over the phone.
- Must you be so churlish?
- I think I'm entitled.
The one comfort in being divorced is that you're both losers.
Eventually the time comes when one person is the first to move on.
Quite frankly, I'd hoped it would be me.
Well, I'd hoped it would be me, and it was.
But I'd like to think that, the other way around, I would have been happy for you.
If you love him, I am happy for you.
I do.
Brian has been a dutiful suitor and I'm convinced, to within an acceptable margin of error, that he loves me.
- Does Frederick like him?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Oh, Frasier.
Brian could never take your place that way.
You're Frederick's father.
Congratulations.
Well, it looks like they made up.
- Hello, everyone.
- Lilith, what a pleasant surprise!
How was Bora Bora?
Never seen you looking so tan.
My God, what does she look like in winter?
We have some happy news.
Lilith is going to be married again.
- To who?
- Someone else.
Oh, that's great!
Congratulations!
Wonderful!
Oh.
Yes.
- Wonderful.
When?
- Tomorrow in Las Vegas.
Oh, Lilith!
How delightfully kitschy.
You're poking fun at the institution by getting married in the tackiest place possible.
Brian's family lives in Las Vegas.
Well, isn't that convenient?
You'll have someone to show you the museums.
- It was lovely seeing you again.
- I'll walk you out.
I hope you haven't found this too unsettling.
No, no.
It's actually good that you're getting remarried.
We could have kept wondering if we'd made a mistake, if we should have worked it out.
Was it me?
Was it you?
Was it us?
Was it you?
- Now we can move on.
- What's next for you?
I'll try to smooth things over with Madeline.
Try very hard.
She seems worth it.
She'll need convincing.
I could try asking her back to Bora Bora.
I'll lay on the whole package: buy the tickets, pay for the hotel, get a limo - champagne, caviar, the whole nine yards.
I'll sweep her off her feet and into my bed.
I do own it, you know.
- Would you like to kiss the bride?
- My pleasure.
- You're really happy for me?
- Of course.
You'll understand if I don't jump up and down.
Yes.
I've already seen that.
Why don't we pick up where we left off, Frasier?
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?
Oh, my God!
Oh.
Oh, my Oh, God, I just had the most frightening dream!
Thank God I'm here with you!
We have all week to analyse your dream.
Right now, there's a huge bug in the shower.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Where have you been?
We're on in two minutes!
Forgive me, but I was busy preparing your schedule for tomorrow.
Lunch with the manager, flowers for your sister-in-law in the hospital.
Oh, yes.
Maris' facelift.
- I didn't know she needed one.
- She doesn't.
All she needs is a little sun, some exercise and a personality.
- What are those?
- Copies of your schedule.
Why are you running to the Xerox room for copies of my schedule?
- Is it because of that new intern?
- Eli.
- He's probably all of 19!
- That's legal.
Well, koo koo ka choo, Mrs Robinson.
He's so gorgeous you just want to bite him all over.
Haven't you seen him?
No.
I've been eating out lately.
You're not serious about dating him?
Why can older men date younger women, but not the other way round?
I don't make the rules.
I just enjoy them.
You're on.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.
I'll be with you for three hours.
Roz, who's our first caller?
Linda, calling from a car phone.
Hello, Linda.
I'm listening.
'My husband and I are in the middle of a fight.
'We're on our way to the Antique Mart.
'We're lost, but he won't stop and ask for directions.
' Yes, this is a common source of friction among couples.
Some men need to be in control.
They see asking for help as weakness.
'Everybody knows that.
I called to ask 'how we get to the Antique Mart from Cherokee and 14th Street.
' 'I don't need directions!
I know where I am!
' 'We're lost, Walter.
Face it, we're lost.
' This isn't normally the kind of advice I give, but let me see.
I've lived in Seattle most of my life.
- I have a map right here.
- No, thanks, I don't need any help.
Eddie, that's disgusting!
Why do animals drag things in?
- What is it?
A rat?
- No.
A stupid doll.
He carries it everywhere.
He never did this before you had him fixed.
- Hello.
- Not at the hospital?
I'm on my way now.
Poor Maris.
She has no hospital experience.
Except the usual childhood things: tonsils, adenoids, force-feeding.
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.
Cosmetic surgery.
Her chin, her lips, her cheeks, her eyelids You'd be faster telling us what she's leaving alone.
- In my opinion, this is just vanity.
- It's not vanity, it's insecurity.
Women fall victim to our culture's worship at the altar of beauty.
Women over 40 feel unattractive if they don't have perfect hair, porcelain skin, limpid eyes, pouting lips, the voluptuous contours of a goddess.
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten what my point was.
I know just what you mean.
I fell victim to that pressure myself.
- I had a mole removed.
- Where?
Just south of Manchester.
- I meant where on your body?
- So did I. So, what time is the surgery tomorrow?
First thing in the morning.
I was wondering if I might have your moral support down at the hospital.
- Sure.
No problem.
- Thank you.
Well, I'd better be off.
Hey, Niles.
It's not my business, but how much is this setting you back?
In the neighbourhood of $25,000.
For an extra five grand, you can get a new wife from the Philippines.
- Ah, Dr Crane.
- Dr Sternstein.
Excuse me Your wife is recovering, but it went splendidly.
- You can see her in a few minutes.
- Thank you.
All right, Mrs Patterson.
He's an incredible plastic surgeon.
Did you see that woman?
- Mr Patterson is a lucky man.
- Maybe that was Mr Patterson.
Guess whose room I passed by on the way down the hall: Artie Walsh.
- Dad's old partner?
- Yes, he was in for tests last week.
The results weren't very good.
- Oh, no!
I always liked him.
- Yeah.
I remember him inviting us for weenie roasts when we were kids.
I'm sure he remembers you, too - asking for a salade niçoise.
- Does Dad know he's here?
- I doubt it.
- Think he wants to?
- No.
They haven't spoken in years.
Did Artie say why they had a fight?
No, he's tight lipped.
But, with some arm-twisting, he admitted it was Dad's fault.
You should try the cafeteria here.
They've got a new chef.
He's from Yemen.
So many of the great ones are!
Dad, Artie Walsh is in hospital here.
He's not at all well.
I know.
They may have to scoop out half his intestines.
Taste this meat loaf.
It's just chewy enough.
No, thank you.
Are you going to see him?
- Can't think of any good reason to.
- He was your best friend.
He never came when I took that bullet and was lying with tubes and drains from every bodily opening.
At least taste this gravy.
Dad, we're talking about a few minutes out of your life to have a little chat with a very sick man.
Now, come on!
You'll be glad you did.
That sanctimonious tone may wow them on the radio, but it doesn't cut ice with me.
When I say "no", I mean it.
I'm not chatting with Artie Walsh.
- Artie thought as much.
- What did he say?
That you wouldn't have the guts to see him.
Then he sniggered.
I've got news for him!
I've got twice the guts he has!
And after his surgery tomorrow, I'll have four times the guts!
Artie, it's me again.
- Martin?
- Artie.
Dad insisted on rushing over to see you, didn't you?
Yeah, well They said you were in pretty rocky shape.
They've been saying a lot of things.
- Well, Marty, how's it been going?
- OK.
Good.
Small steps.
- Sorry you're laid up.
- Thanks.
It's nice of you to come by.
- Somebody had to be the big man.
- Yeah.
What's that supposed to mean?
- I think you know.
- Why don't you tell me?
I'm being bigger than you were.
- With that lousy bullet in your hip?
- It hurt.
Not enough!
- A bullet might have improved you.
- Be glad it wasn't the butt.
- It could have caused brain damage.
- You always want the last word.
- I don't want any words with you.
- Too bad!
I've got some choice ones.
Next time, we'll stay longer.
Stop staring at me like that!
I didn't touch your damned doll.
Look, even if I did, I did it for your own good.
You were the joke of the park.
Even the poodles were laughing.
Oh, all right.
Here.
Got to get that dog a Gl Joe.
Yes, Maris, I'm sure.
No, you can't gain weight from a glucose IV.
No, there's no such thing as a NutraSweet drip.
Just close your eyes and go to sleep.
Good night, Puppy Toes.
Is everything OK?
No.
She can't get on with her nurses.
How can a reputable hospital hire such troublemakers?
Yes, the Little Sisters of Mercy have always had that reputation.
Dad, how was your reunion with Artie?
Lousy.
What started this bad blood between the two of you?
He spread a rumour about me at work.
- About what?
- None of your business.
I don't want to talk about it.
Subject closed.
Must have been pretty bad.
- Must have been on the take.
- More likely drugs.
- Drugs, yes.
Or sex.
- Or all three.
All right, it was worse than any of that.
He told people I cried at "Brian's Song".
Dear God.
You think that's the kind of thing that happens to other people's fathers.
I wasn't crying!
Me and Artie were watching the movie and I got some pretzel salt in my eye.
Artie told everybody.
I became the joke of the department.
Other cops left Kleenex on my desk.
They called me Boo-hoo Crane.
I can understand your being upset with him, but what's he so cheesed off with you for?
Well, I I guess I let something slip about the size of his wife's behind.
- I beg your pardon?
- She's got this gigantic rear end.
Looks like she's shoplifting pillows.
You felt compelled to share that with him?
For 20 years, I tried not to, then, one day, I let my guard down.
We were coming into work, and he says, "How's the wife"?
And I said, "At least she doesn't have an arse the size of Albuquerque.
" A 20-year relationship ruined because of a little name-calling?
No, there's more to it than that.
Artie always had to have the last word.
He couldn't leave well alone.
Couldn't let sleeping dogs lie.
You'd think it was all over, then he'd start again.
Can we drop this?
I've got better things to do than sit in a hospital room taking abuse.
Oh, God, I'm due back with Maris.
- I'll be sleeping at the hospital tonight.
- Why?
Maris' doctor feels it soothes the patient to copy the home environment.
So I slipped a gun under her pillow and got a room across the hall.
We'd better say a prayer for the night nurse.
It's a shame your father and his friend can't let bygones be bygones.
- I don't know what else to do.
- Maybe if I had a go at it.
I've come to have a pretty good understanding of how the Crane mind works.
When it works.
- About your partner - I don't want to talk about it.
No, I just wanted to tell you I'm on your side.
- I say good riddance to bad rubbish.
- Damn right.
You can't have had any good times.
There weren't many.
Occasionally, we'd go fishing.
- That's not much fun.
- Not the way I did it.
But Artie decided he'd teach me.
He even bought this beat-up old boat.
He said after we retired, we'd get more use out of it.
It seems pushy to foist his interests on you.
Oh, it wasn't so bad.
I remember once I bust my hump reeling in what turned out to be an old slipper.
You know what Artie did?
Unhooked it and threw it on the barbecue.
Maybe he wasn't such a bad guy after all.
Maybe you're right.
I listen to myself talk and I sound like a big fool.
- Thanks, Daphne.
You opened my eyes.
- I thought I might.
I'm going to go to that hospital, buy him a big stuffed animal, throw my arms around him and never let him go.
You really are a hateful old sod, aren't you?
Come on, Eddie!
Time for your walk.
Hello?
Yes, it is.
Oh, I see.
I guess it isn't really a shock, considering.
Yes.
I'm sure they did everything they could.
Thank you.
- Who was that?
- We can talk about it later, Dad.
- Is everything OK?
- Why do you ask?
I hear you say "I'm sorry" and such like.
It's natural to be concerned.
- You thought it was about Artie.
- No!
- Yes, you did.
- So what if I did?
It proves you still care about him.
All right, suppose I do feel bad about this fight.
What the hell can I do?
That's up to you.
I could drive you to the hospital.
I don't need you.
I can drive myself.
You can't.
That was your mechanic.
Your transmission's dead.
- Artie - Oh, Jeez!
- You guys got off on the wrong foot.
- All right.
I'll handle this.
Artie - Will you turn the TV off?
- I'll turn it down.
Listen, Artie, I'm sorry about some of those things I said earlier, OK?
Maybe all of them.
I was steamed that you never came to see me in hospital.
I didn't come by because I didn't think you'd want see me.
Of course I wanted to!
- That's what my wife said.
- Oh, yeah.
Loretta.
It's nice of you to come.
It's not easy for someone as stubborn as you.
Me stubborn?
I'm not the one who always has to have the last No, you're right, Artie.
I am stubborn.
- And it wasn't easy.
- Thanks, Martin.
We have a few things to talk about, so if you'll just wait outside, it'll be a lot easier.
Anything I said would be irrelevant.
As a therapist, you learn once things are working, anything else would be What's an old cop like you doing in a joint like this?
Believe me, I didn't expect to end like this.
End?
You'll be out raising hell before you know it.
I don't know.
The doctors aren't tossing their hats in the air.
My sons are doctors.
They don't know nothing.
You've got to get out of here.
We've got a lot of lost time to make up for.
- You still got that stupid boat?
- Yeah.
I hung on to it.
We'll sink that damn thing yet.
Hey, Artie, remember the time you barbecued the slipper?
Stuff always tastes better when you catch it yourself.
- What are you doing here?
- I got Artie and Dad talking again.
I had to resort to some cheap, manipulative pseudo-psychology.
Always go to your strengths.
Looks like you've bought out the entire gift shop for Maris.
This isn't for Maris.
It's for her nurses.
They're meeting to discuss her and I gather hospital strikes are ugly.
- Visiting hours are over.
- Thank you.
I'll go round up Dad.
Excuse me.
Do you work on my wife's floor, Mrs Maris Crane?
Yes, I do.
I'd like you to have these chocolates.
- I'm on the night shift.
- And this lovely watch.
Dad, it's time to go.
What?
You get another phone call about your dad's transmission?
- Your dad told me about that.
- All I was doing was I know what you were doing.
Thanks, kid.
- See you soon.
- Sure.
OK, we've got a deal.
When you get out of this joint, you give me fishing lessons.
- If I get out.
- When you get out.
You can't have the last word on this one.
- See you, Marty.
- See you, Art.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Take care.
Take care.
Stay loose!
See you, Artie!
See you, Marty.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Time for one last call.
Who's next?
- Elliott, on line three.
Hello, Elliott.
I'm listening.
'I'm a salesman ' A salesman?
!
How old are you?
- '43.
' - 43?
- 'Yeah.
' - Let's be truthful.
'I'm 43.
' Elliott, we weren't born yesterday.
You're an adolescent trying to be clever by getting on air, but you're taking time from people with real problems.
'Hey, I'm 43.
My problem is, I have a young-sounding voice 'that people make fun of all the time.
' Oh, I I'm so sorry, Elliott.
That was very insensitive of me.
'Gotcha, Dr Dufus!
' Indeed you did get us, Elliott.
But we're not so stuffy that we can't laugh at ourselves.
Roz, keep these pimply-faced maggots off the air!
Well, that's our show for today.
This is Dr Crane signing off and wishing you good mental health.
- Have a good weekend.
- Wait.
I want an honest answer to a question.
No, that outfit does not make you look fat.
That's not it.
Why would you think so?
Women usually begin that question with "I want an honest answer".
I'm not that insecure.
Sorry.
You're right.
Your question?
Is the back of my head unattractive?
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm serious.
You know I have season tickets for the Seahawks?
Well, this cute guy sits behind me.
A few weeks ago, we said "hi", but he hasn't asked me out.
So I thought the back of my head might be weird.
There could be hundreds of reasons he hasn't asked.
That makes me feel better!
Maybe he's married, maybe he's gay.
Or maybe he's there to watch football and not cruise chicks.
You're right.
I'm being ridiculous.
- Of course.
See you Monday.
- All right.
I saw that!
Wait!
You're not getting the rest of my scone so forget it.
Mmm.
It's really good.
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.
You can sit there till you're blue in the face.
As far as I'm concerned you don't exist.
Oh, all right!
Here!
Get fat!
He got you again?
You're a soft touch.
- I am not.
- He never begs with me.
- Maybe he doesn't like what you eat.
- He's not picky.
He eats beetles.
Eddie!
Let's go for another walk.
- I thought you walked him today.
- I did.
Twice.
- He's got to go again?
- No.
I do.
That didn't sound right.
There's a nice-looking man with a dog.
We want to run into them again.
Come on, Eddie.
He's playing hard to get.
I'm glad somebody is.
Will you fix the toilet?
It's running.
The noise drives me crazy.
- I'll call a plumber.
- You've got hands.
Fix it yourself.
I am a doctor.
I've more important things to do than that.
- Hello, Niles.
- Good news.
We're having a salt glow with our massage.
Forget about the plumber.
I'll do it.
My manicurist cancelled on me.
- You will not.
- I bet you don't have any tools.
You're wrong.
Let me show you something.
See this?
Every possible tool for every possible need.
I got it from Hammacher Schlemmer.
- Is that turquoise inlay?
- Yes.
It also comes in ebony and onyx.
- Onyx is so showy.
- I love onyx.
It resonates within me.
This is why I never took any home movies.
Do you two realise what delicate doilies you are?
You don't know the meaning of the word "self-reliant".
Thank God there's no disaster happening.
- Oh, oh!
A lemon zester.
- Yes.
You know, Niles I'd actually like to fix that toilet just to prove Dad wrong.
For the genetically superior, the last challenge of a toilet should be how to use one.
We've conquered the intellectual world but with nuts and bolts, we need help.
- You're serious?
- Yes.
We'll fix it.
Good experience, and it'll shut Dad up.
- We'll show him we're tough.
- Exactly.
We can let the eucalyptus wrap be our reward.
Maris, I'm afraid I'll be delayed a few hours.
Frasier and I are tackling a home repair.
Yes, I'm working with my hands.
Yes, I've worked up a bit of a sweat.
I suppose I could take my shirt off.
- What are you doing?
- She's aroused by my manual labour.
Maris, I'm holding some sort of a wrench.
Give me that!
Hello, Maris.
Niles is busy now.
Never mind what I'm wearing!
- May we continue?
- Fine.
Take the ball cock assembly, thread it through the tank hole and fasten it under the tank with a locknut.
Yes, locknut.
See Niles?
Till today you didn't know what a locknut was.
That Niles is dead.
Call me Dutch.
Working with our hands like this, I'm reminded of that glorious tradition of the Amish barn raising.
All the men of the village coming together, the mind, the muscle, all toward that one simple yet extraordinary goal.
All right.
We are ready to flush.
Here's to what we accomplish when we put our minds to it.
Flush away!
It's working!
Oh, my God!
It's draining out of the tank into the bowl.
Filling the tank.
I've seen it so often but never has it meant so much.
- Shouldn't it stop now?
- Yes.
- It's overflowing.
- Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, God!
- What does it say to do now?
- Nothing.
Where are your Amish friends now?
The plumber's been called.
The wine's chilled.
My world makes sense again.
We've had a tough day.
We've tangled with a little pipe and porcelain.
Now it's Montrachet time.
We made a mistake in trying to fix it.
Yes.
We tampered with the natural order of things.
But now, order has been restored.
By hiring a plumber, that plumber can buy, say, a Dolly Parton album.
Miss Parton finances a tour, allowing a local promoter to afford to send his cross-dressing son to us for $150-an-hour therapy.
To the circle of life!
Must be the plumber.
Are you answering it or hiring someone to?
Dad, we tried, OK?
Oh, please, I wasn't doing anything.
Let me get it.
- Somebody call a plumber?
- Not soon enough.
Follow me.
- Nice way to spend an afternoon!
- We're psychiatrists, not plumbers.
Some heads you shouldn't tamper with.
- You've got to get him out of here.
- What?
That man is not fit to touch your toilet.
Niles, have you been self-medicating again?
- That was Danny Kriezel.
- Kriezel the weasel?
How can you be sure?
It's been 25 years.
I'd know him anywhere.
He bullied me all my childhood.
He didn't recognise you.
Because he wasn't flushing my head in a toilet.
That was his trademark.
He called it a swirly.
I remember the Kriezel reign of terror.
I can trace my fear of confined spaces back to when his older brother, Billy, shoved me into a locker for wearing a girl's field hockey uniform.
- I didn't mean to deny you your pain.
- Thank you.
I can hear Kriezel's mocking voice as he hoisted me over the bowl.
"Hold your breath, jocko.
" The crowd would start its awful chant.
"There goes Crane, down the drain.
There goes Crane " Niles, stop!
Niles!
Niles!
Get a hold of yourself!
Stop it!
You're a renowned psychiatrist now.
Kriezel won the battle in junior high, but that's where he peaked.
You won the war.
You know the expression: - "Living well is the best revenge.
" - Wonderful.
I just don't know how true it is.
You don't see it turning up in a lot of opera plots.
Ludwig, maddened by the poisoning of his family, wreaks vengeance in the third act by living well.
All right, Niles.
Then Wotan wreaks vengeance by living even better than the Duke.
Oh, all right!
- That's a new part, right?
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're charging me for a new part so I wouldn't want a used part.
What are you, the plumbing police?
I'll be back.
Don't mind me.
I came for an aspirin.
Tannic acid gives me a headache.
But that's the price I pay for drinking expensive wine.
- Hey.
- Yes?
You've got a real mess here.
My partner will have to bring new parts.
- That's two guys on golden time.
OK?
- It's only money.
Say, has somebody been trying to fix this thing?
Not me.
I don't even set the clock in my Mercedes E320.
- Boy!
That's a nice car.
- Yes.
I should say it is.
I had one for a while.
But it was too small for the family so we upgraded to the S-class.
You have the big Mercedes?
Yeah, and I've got to tell you, my He's a great kid.
Except he got in a fight the other day.
Really?
Some small-boned child with superior language skills?
No!
A big jerk who tried to steal his lunch money.
Oh.
Well, there's nothing like a bully.
I've got to tell you, I'd rather he'd be a bully than a wussy kid that gets picked on, you know the kind?
- Kids too gutless to fight back.
- You admire those who fight back?
Well, sure.
I mean If you don't fight back, what are you?
You're a wuss, a wimp.
- You're a - Stop!
Niles!
Leave the man alone.
He's trying to work.
What's Dr Crane doing?
He's frustrated because I wouldn't let him do something.
He's taking his anger out on my ficus.
I've never seen him so angry.
He's like a madman.
Good Lord!
There's a bee out there the size of a wood finch.
Are you ready to talk now?
No.
I'm not ready yet.
Niles, I have to be honest.
I'm a little disappointed in you.
Were you actually going to stick someone's head into a toilet?
You don't seem to understand.
This beast has been awakened within me.
Can you get that for me?
Niles, there is a beast in all of us.
Part of becoming an adult is learning to control it.
That separates us from the Kriezels.
Also their tendency to squat down and groom each other.
You have an opportunity with Danny I've never had with Billy.
To confront him as a rational adult and achieve closure.
Easier said than done.
One look at that oafish face, those dead Kriezel eyes, you see there's no chance for communication.
There is, Niles.
There has to be.
I can't go in.
If he turns his back on me, I'll attack him.
No, you won't.
You're not a child any more.
Come with me.
I'm taking you to the bathroom.
Excuse me, sir.
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- Yeah.
Go ahead.
I'd like to take you back in time to the 1970s.
There was a gifted student at John Adams Junior High.
You terrorised that student simply because he was different from you.
- I was that student.
- No kidding?
Could we step into the living room and reach an understanding?
It's OK with me.
Any room in the house is still $59 an hour.
I'll be right back, Billy.
Billy?
That's my brother for you.
Always getting into stuff.
But your friend's getting all worked up over nothing.
- You think so, Billy?
- Kids pick on other kids.
- It made those weak kids tougher.
- Really?
You're a big guy.
You must have been involved in stuff.
Oh, I was involved.
Billy, I'd like to take you back in time.
No.
Let me take you back.
I remember once, we jammed this poindexter into a locker wearing a girl's hockey uniform.
No, I'm sorry.
I just don't remember you.
Perhaps you'll remember third period gym class?
You made me wear my jockstrap like a tiara.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Were you the kid who used to carry his gym shorts in an attaché case?
It was a valise.
I remember you.
Boy, those were some crazy times.
- Do you ever see any of the old gang?
- You're missing the point.
I was severely scarred by those experiences.
Wait.
I can't defend everything I did in junior high.
Who can?
But let's face it: you show up wearing a tweed blazer with elbow patches, and carrying a valise, I mean, I think the guilt here is 50-50.
He's yelling about repressed tendencies so we stuffed a fire extinguisher down his pants.
We called it - A jet pack.
- That's it!
Man, you remember them all.
My next question is why did you behave this way?
I don't know.
I mean, I guess because people thought it was funny.
I see.
So, to get this validation, you would, say, squeeze my head between your ankles and hop around the lunchroom?
- I did that to you?
- Yes.
How does that make you feel?
Well, kind of bad.
The healing has begun.
On the bus, we pantsed him.
He's yelling, "Give me back my pants"!
But, whoops!
They fell out the window.
So the aggressive acts were misplaced outbursts aimed at your father.
Yes.
He was the real bully, wasn't he?
- Oh, yes.
- Let it out, Danny.
Nothing I ever did was good enough for him.
I am so sorry that I picked on you, man.
I just wanted to be good at something and I was good at that.
You were the best.
Then we made him dance the hula in his underwear in front of the girls.
- You should have been there.
- I was there!
- Thanks.
This has just been terrific.
- I can't take all the credit.
My brother convinced me a civilised person can work anything out as long as he's calm and rational.
Run, Niles, run!
The beast is loose!
- You really shoved his head in here?
- I don't know.
It's all a blur.
I guess I just lost control.
- I bet it felt good, though, didn't it?
- No.
It felt damned good!
Pity you didn't do it 20 years ago.
You'd have given him a better swirly.
These low-flow toilets don't have the same velocity as the old ones.
- What did he do to you?
- Not a thing.
- You paid him off?
- I've never written a cheque so fast.
Well There she goes.
Good as new.
- Thanks.
Can I buy you a beer?
- Yeah, sounds good.
Come on, Eddie.
Oh, for God's sake, Eddie, don't drink out of the toilet.
Some guy just had his head in there.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
'You see, Dr Crane, there's this man I'd like to go out with, 'but he's 40 and he's never been married.
'Does that mean something?
' It could mean he has a fear of commitment or it could mean he's just been lucky.
Marie, that was a joke.
'Did I mention I'm calling from a payphone?
' All right, Marie, I would say, give him a shot, but I'd keep that caution bulb lit.
Thank you for your call.
Who's next?
If someone's never been married, it might mean they're a careful shopper.
A divorcé will bite into any piece of fruit without squeezing it first.
That was an unbiased opinion from my unmarried producer, Roz, who, incidentally, has squeezed more fruit than Tropicana.
May we take another call?
We could but it's time for a station break.
Then we'll be right back after this.
- Didn't we just take a break?
- I'm parked at a meter.
I'll be back.
Do I have headphone hair?
I may have to flirt my way out of a ticket.
- Are you all right?
- I got winded but I'm OK.
- Ow!
My ankle!
- Here, Roz, does this hurt?
- No nerve damage.
- She should have an x-ray.
- Frasier, the show!
- I'll get someone to fill in.
No, now!
You've got dead air!
Ow!
- Take the shoe off.
- Oh!
- Oh, dear!
- What is it?
It's been a while since our last pedicure.
- Who is it?
- Frasier.
How were things at the emergency room?
Frustrating.
You know how it is.
You're sitting there in agony and every crybaby with a gunshot waltzes in ahead of you.
- How was it after I left?
- Weird Bruce took over for you.
That's quite a boot collection.
Why not put notches in your bedpost?
Those are mine.
You hate the way I've decorated, don't you?
No, no.
As a matter of fact, I admire your courage.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Freud said all we need to be happy is work and love.
Oh, thanks, Frasier!
So you brought me work.
Answering the fan mail is something to do.
Remember, this time, death threats don't get photos.
- Who is it?
- It's Bulldog!
- Pretend we're not here.
- Roz, you just said, "Who is it"?
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey, Dog.
Hey, Roz.
Wow!
The whole place is a bedroom!
- What are you doing here?
- I brought some deli.
Nothing says "I'm sorry" like fatty meat.
You got pastrami, coleslaw OK, where's the French fries?
I ordered fries!
This stinks!
This is total BS!
That apron boy is Oh!
Here they are.
To think he does it all without steroids.
- Shall I stick these in the oven?
- I'm not hungry.
- Then you're not thirsty.
- Glasses are on the top shelf.
- None for me.
I'm off to the opera.
- You can't leave!
- No ice cubes!
- Chip what you can off the freezer.
- If you leave, he'll hit on me.
- With a sprained ankle?
It's like in the jungle, they go after the sick and the lame.
I'm meeting people at the opera.
I've got the tickets.
Here we go.
I'll get you more ice when the feeling in my forehead comes back.
Curtain going up.
Roz, if you need anything, call me absolutely any time.
Except the next three hours.
I'm at the opera.
No, four hours.
It's Wagner.
Then I've got a late supper, bed, an early squash game.
Call me absolutely any time after 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Hey, this is nice, you and me having a drink together.
Yeah, it's been fun.
Bye.
- Why did you paint only two toenails?
- It hurts when I reach.
- You want me to finish them?
- No, please.
It's OK.
- Nice colour.
Goes with the bruise.
- Bulldog, stop it!
- You've got nice feet.
- You don't think they're too big?
I could get this whole thing in my mouth, easy.
It's really nice to do all this for me.
Kind of surreal, but nice.
I figure if I'm nice to you, maybe you'll be nice to me.
I knew it!
You come over here acting all sympathetic, but you're the same horny, low-class slime ball as ever!
Hey, before you say something that offends me Look, all I wanted to ask you is if you'd be interested in producing my show.
- What?
- I'm not crazy about my producer.
Let's face it, you're the best.
- You think so?
- That goes without saying.
Frasier goes without saying it.
Don't answer now.
Take your time and think about it.
But I warn you - when I set my mind on something, I get it.
I once wanted to interview George Foreman.
He said "no", but I got him.
I had to paint his toenails four times, but I got him.
Your bandage has been too tight.
Keep the blood flowing to the ligaments.
That feels great.
Whatever Frasier is paying you, it's not enough.
Actually, I'd need a raise to get me to "not enough".
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey.
What's going on?
- Niles bought me some new shoes.
- Oh, yes, look: they have tassels.
Aren't they exquisite?
They were individually handmade by an artisan near Florence.
He is a hero there.
It's an event when he completes a pair of shoes.
They ring the cathedral bell and the town celebrates.
There's a town that needs a bowling alley.
- Evening, all.
- Hey, Frasier.
Roz, did you hear the show?
I was in top form.
I brilliantly cut a narcissist down to size.
Thank you, Niles.
Oh, Dad, new shoes?
Do I hear cathedral bells?
Ring-a-ding-ding.
Roz, I apologise for leaving you last night.
I hope you didn't have to fend off Bulldog.
He's not so bad.
Actually, we had a good time.
- Oh?
- What, "oh"?
I noticed he came into work wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday.
Oh?
- What's going on?
- Roz slept with Bulldog last night.
I did not!
How could you think that?
Dropping by, bringing you gifts - he was after something.
That's not fair.
Dr Crane brings me gifts and he's not after anything.
I did not sleep with Bulldog.
He didn't even hit on me.
But he wanted something.
He wanted me to leave you and be his producer.
I wonder why he said that.
- Because he really wants me.
- Yes, that goes without saying.
- For his show.
- Bulldog knows he has to be subtle.
But his ultimate goal remains to - To what?
- To play Aeneas to your Dido.
I'm sorry you had to hear that, Daphne.
As usual, I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about.
This is so insulting.
You think he wants me to work for him just to get me into his bed.
It doesn't occur to you he thinks I'm a good producer.
- Aren't you being naive?
- I'll tell you what naive is.
It's someone who thinks he can talk to me like that without getting a crutch up his butt!
- I'm an expert in human behaviour!
- Oh, really?
Excuse me.
I've heard your expert advice!
The only mental disorder you've ever cured is insomnia!
So you had time to listen, what with your demanding tasks: answering phones and pushing buttons.
A cockatoo with a strong beak could do what you do!
Then hire one.
I'm taking the job with Bulldog.
That's it.
I am out of here.
Take a picture, because I'm out of your life!
You have seen the last of me!
Sayonara!
Oh, damn!
My purse.
Bruce, I see we are loaded with callers.
What line is next?
- What's your favourite number?
- Three.
Damn.
What's your other favourite number?
Just let me handle this.
Hello.
You're on the line with Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
'Hi, Dr Crane.
My name is Francesca.
'I'm calling about my boyfriend.
He says he loves me, 'but I'm afraid I'll get home one day and he won't be there.
'It probably stems from my childhood when my father left us.
' Francesca, you are suffering from a fear of abandonment, but I'm here for you.
'Thank you.
I'm always so afraid 'the people I count on will' just disappear and I'll ' Sorry.
Francesca, we had a little technical glitch.
We're almost out of time.
Call in tomorrow and I'll make sure you're first.
We're just about wrapped up here.
I'll see you tomorrow, Seattle.
Good show, Dr Crane.
- You think so, Bruce?
- Yeah.
When my show starts with a screech that could shatter crystal, then plays me eating chips, then disconnects a woman who fears abandonment, it's not a show to mail to the Smithsonian.
Don't worry, man.
You'll do better tomorrow.
- It's going to be a great show, Roz.
- You've got a minute to show time.
- Hello, Roz.
- Hello, Frasier.
Hope you haven't been avoiding me because I stole your chick.
- We're getting along great.
- I heard Bruce.
Did the cockatoo want too much money?
- Bye, Roz.
- So long, Frasier.
A moment, Frasier, please.
I'm sure word has reached your ear about my frutti di mare party to celebrate our city's bounty from the sea.
- Yes.
I'd love to come.
- There's the rub.
I've invited Roz.
With the rift between you, the tension will be thicker than my cioppino.
That rift will soon be over.
Bulldog will prove he just wants to get his hands on Roz.
That moment may have arrived.
She's bending over.
Turn around, Bulldog!
Isn't that what golfers refer to as "teeing it up"?
All right.
He moves in.
And he helps pick up the papers!
I'm so sorry, Frasier.
I, too, entertained hopes for low comedy.
Attention, sports fans!
You're back in the doghouse with Bulldog Briscoe!
- Woof woof!
- Meow!
Football: Broncos over the Raiders!
Easy money, eh, Roz?
Yeah, right, and men just want to cuddle.
LA humiliated Denver!
Do I tell you how to clean?
Denver's due.
It's a no-brainer.
Then it's right up your alley.
I'm no sports fan, but they really are quite delicious together.
Enjoy it now.
Bulldog can't control his libido forever.
- Then Roz will crawl back to you.
- Yes.
Meanwhile, I need a half-competent producer.
How hard is that?
# They call me Mr Pitiful # Baby, that's my name # They call me Mr Pitiful # That's how I got my fame # But nobody seems to understand now # What makes a man feel so blue # They call me Mr Pitiful # Cause I lost someone just like you # They call me Mr Pitiful # This everybody knows now # They call me Mr Pitiful # Most everyplace I go now # But nobody seems to understand now # This morning, Maris and I woke to the sound of our gardener hacking through our topiary.
Why do you want hedges shaped like animals?
We're both animal lovers, but Maris is unable to have pets.
She She distrusts anything that loves her unconditionally.
There was Yoshi, drunk as a lord, recklessly swinging his hedge trimmer.
Before we could calm him, he had transformed Maris' prized stallion into an obscene goatboy.
- The poor woman is inconsolable.
- Thank you, Niles.
You've been a great help.
There are worse things than a ruined career.
I could have my hedges cut into unattractive shapes.
It's always about you, isn't it?
I'm just the slightest bit panicky I'll never get Roz back.
I've been waiting for weeks for Bulldog to make his move and he hasn't.
- I thought we might run into you two.
- We've been buying shoes.
Not that I don't appreciate the ones you bought me, but I'll save those for special occasions when only tassels will do.
Hey, get a load of these.
They light up when I walk away.
Doesn't everyone?
I see Mr Congeniality is still spreading sunshine.
- Things didn't go well in his show.
- Really?
These things go in cycles.
Take Bulldog's show.
He's just had one great show after another lately.
What could be your point?
I can't read between the lines.
If you weren't so stubborn, you'd apologise to Roz and get her back.
You're ignoring a key psychological component.
- You'd have to admit you were wrong.
- Exactly!
I don't see what's so hard about that.
It's not the same as Dad or you being wrong.
I have a degree from Harvard.
Whenever I'm wrong, the world makes less sense.
Why do you want her back?
She's pushy and opinionated.
Aren't you being sexist?
That would be labelled "assertiveness" in a man.
Gone are the days when women were shunted aside to say nothing.
- I quite agree.
- Daphne, please, I can handle this.
You've handled it well so far.
It's time you got off your high horse and begged her forgiveness.
And get your knees dusty.
I'm sorry, I'm not quite ready to swallow my pride.
Next time, wake me when the show's over.
End of Wednesday's show we do the "Boner of the Week".
- No.
- This is why I hate you.
You want to change my tried and true format!
Why not?
I got you an interview with Wayne Gretzky.
See Wayne Gretzky?
This is awesome!
This is total brilliance!
This is a pinched nerve.
Football injury.
I got my head rammed into a locker during an interview.
- Let me help you with that.
- This is great.
I can't believe it.
Wayne Gretzky!
The great one!
Roz, you are the great one.
You are some kind of producer.
Thanks.
I'm having a great time.
I owe you, Bulldog.
I owe you big.
It's amazing, but you and I have great chemistry together.
Uh-huh.
I like chemistry.
I flunked it, but I like it.
You got any of that Wild Turkey left?
Yeah.
Sure.
When we started working together, I never thought it would turn out like this.
Did you?
All along!
Hey, Roz!
You'd better make mine a double!
I'm a double kind of guy!
No, there's a lot I want to do tonight and I want you to keep up.
Yeah, well, uh All I ask is you give me a couple of 20-minute breaks.
What's that?
I thought a little music might be nice.
- Can you concentrate with that on?
- Oh, yeah.
Actually, I find the distraction helps me.
Nah.
Second date.
Don't be pushy.
This is great, Roz!
Us working like this!
Did you and the doc ever end up working - What?
- You and the doc ever work like this?
We tried, but he complained I talked too much.
Oh, yeah?
I would have figured you for a screamer.
What the hell are you doing in my bed?
Get out!
I asked you over here to work, you disgusting pervert!
Slow down!
I'm getting some mixed signals here.
- What are you doing?
- Is this clear enough?
- Are you crazy?
My wallet's in there!
- Get out, now!
Get out of my way, Doc!
Oh.
I'm listening.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ah, yes, another beautiful Saturday night.
The moon is full.
The city lights are twinkling.
Lovers steal kisses in the park.
And here chez Crane my father and his assistant sit hunched over 20-year-old photographs of a murdered hooker.
Life is a banquet.
I enjoy looking at this old case.
Just because you have no plans, don't spoil our harmless fun.
We Brits do love a grisly murder and a nice hot cup of tea.
Daphne, I'm busy, so if you don't mind I didn't know I was bothering you.
Sorry.
It's this damn case.
The answer to who murdered Helen is right here.
I just can't see it.
You're obsessing.
You stare at these grisly pictures endlessly.
Let's go and see a movie.
- No.
- Pizza?
- Nah.
- Let's get tattooed.
Oh!
This is ridiculous!
It's a beautiful night.
I'm going to take a nice long walk.
And I'm not going by myself.
He likes the rhododendrons on the north side of the park.
'Dr Crane, thanks to your advice, 'I've conquered my fear of heights.
'I took it slowly, gradually going higher and higher 'until here I am, having lunch at the top of the Space Needle.
' - Marjorie, I'm so proud of you.
- 'When I think of how I ' - What happened?
- 'I looked down.
' Look at your luncheon companions or your menu, but don't look down.
You're only feeding your fears.
'Maybe I'm not ready for a window table.
' No, no, of course you are.
You can beat this thing.
'You're right.
I can, Dr Crane, if I just ' - Do not look down!
- 'No, I didn't.
'My cheque just came.
' Well, Marjorie, we're out of time now.
Call me tomorrow, will you?
That's it for today.
Stay tuned for Bulldog Briscoe.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 Talk Radio.
- Hey, Doc.
- Bulldog.
I caught some of your show today.
If that whining chick called me, I'd say, "If you don't want people snapping your bra, don't wear one.
" Brilliant in its simplicity.
How does this sound, hard body?
You, me, Sonics, Knicks, tonight?
I'm already going.
I have season tickets.
- We could get together afterwards.
- Only if I smash into your car.
Why do the ones that want it the most put up the biggest struggle?
Because, when I do finally give in, I want us to enjoy it all the more.
If I'm not distracted by the fact that every man on earth has died.
Almost had her there.
Yes, it could have gone either way.
Well, I can get those any time I want.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Bulldog, my brother, Niles.
- Niles, this is Bulldog Briscoe.
- Just the man.
You can tell me why none of the local media carry the Ivy League squash standings.
Whoa!
Another one just like you!
Some gypsy put a curse on your family?
- See you later, Miles.
- It's Niles.
Like it matters.
Are you ready for our boys' night out at Le Cochon Noir?
Yes.
But, Niles, I've been wondering.
Would you mind if Dad joined us?
Last time we took Dad to a four-star restaurant, he had a miserable time and the restaurant lost a star.
I want to get him out.
He's on one of his weeping lotus binges again.
We've taken him everywhere from the Arboretum to the Zen Garden.
Wait!
The Zen Garden is at the Arboretum.
Have we only taken him one place?
- Oh, Niles, the basketball game!
- Basketball?
Yes.
I can get another ticket.
Imagine how excited Dad will be to go to a game with his two sons.
It's the archetypal male bonding ritual.
Couldn't we just go into the woods and kill something?
- All right.
- You can see the Tacoma Dome.
I've seen it.
They had a home show there once.
That's where I got the idea to stencil the Welsh dresser.
I'm a teamster compared to you.
Peanuts!
Peanuts!
Niles, the game's that way!
I'm calculating our escape route in case of fire or unrest.
- Maris taught me.
- You love her, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
Why?
- It helps to know that.
Here we are.
One beer and two glasses of wine.
I'm sure it's good.
They opened a fresh box when they poured it.
You ought to be drinking beer.
Dad, I only drink beer when I eat German food, which is to say never!
- Did you notice the facilities?
- As you feared: communal urinals.
What do I do about my shy kidneys?
- Aren't these great seats?
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Lend me your pen.
- What for?
- A note about that ballistics report.
We came here to get your mind off the case.
I've done some reading.
It seems the key for the Sonics is to stop Starks from penetrating and dumping the ball off.
"Stop Starks"?
That sounds funny: stop Starks, stop Starks Shut up!
- It makes no sense!
- I'm just quoting some sports writer.
No, Helen was tall, yet the bullet entered on a downward trajectory.
Dad, please try to participate.
Look, they're starting a wave!
That was fun, wasn't it?
There's a peanut guy.
Peanut!
How dare you?
Niles Stop it!
He's pelting me with peanuts See that tray!
He's come prepared!
Stop it!
That is for me!
- I got to make a call.
- Not about the case?
- Yes.
- You've been working on it for years.
Why are you so obsessed now?
I promised her mother that, however long it took, I'd find the killer.
She called me last week.
She's an old lady living in a home somewhere.
She doesn't have a lot longer to go.
It spurred me on to get it solved.
So I appreciate your bringing me here but I've got to make this call.
OK, Dad.
I understand.
Boy, the traffic tonight is murder.
Hey, pal, what's the score?
"West Side Story".
This picture of the crime scene has always bugged me.
The way Helen's written "help".
Why?
Well, I suppose the word "howdy" would have been a bit too cheery.
It makes no sense.
Anybody who could read it could see her lying there.
- Evening, Dad.
- Thanks again for the ball game.
It was a pleasure.
I'm sorry you couldn't join us for dinner.
Le Cochon Noir gave us a fabulous dinner.
It was marred only by the lack of even one outstanding cognac on their carte des digestifs.
But think of it this way.
What's the one thing better than an exquisite meal?
An exquisite meal with one tiny flaw we can pick at all night.
Quite right.
To impossible standards!
- So, Dad, any progress on the case?
- Nah, I'm beat.
Sometimes it's better to start fresh in the morning.
Good night.
Brush your teeth, say your prayers.
I used to say that when you were kids, didn't I?
- No, you didn't.
- Oh.
- I meant to.
- We knew that.
- Hello.
- Hello, Daphne!
- How was dinner?
- Fine except for one tiny flaw.
Oh, just the way you like it.
I see you're intrigued.
It's a while since I've gone over it.
- Who are these guys?
- The principal players in the drama.
That's Detective Shelby, the cop who found the body.
Who is this menacing monobrow?
Robitaille, the logger, an ex-boyfriend of Helen's.
Every few months, they'd disappear together.
He's the murderer.
- He's got an airtight alibi.
- What?
He was killing somebody else at the time.
But you have to admit this case has it all: sex, greed, jealousy, revenge, a monkey, hatred, deception Wait, wait, wait!
A monkey?
This is a snapshot of the murder victim with her pet monkey, Coco.
He was given to her by another boyfriend, Clive Brisbane.
- Why wasn't Brisbane a suspect?
- He was.
Witnesses saw him at the racetrack at the time of the murder.
- Brisbane the animal trainer?
- Yes.
Brisbane's Amazing Apes.
They opened in Las Vegas for Engelbert Humperdinck.
You forget there was a time when Las Vegas wasn't tacky like now.
I once caught his act on a trip to Vegas during college.
Those apes were amazing!
They staged a tableau of Washington crossing the Delaware and then shot suction-cup arrows at Brisbane's assistant's derrière.
You know there is a way that Brisbane could be the killer and still have his horse track alibi hold up.
Daphne, Niles I present you with the killer!
- A monkey was the trigger man?
- Play along with me.
They can shoot arrows.
Why not a gun?
- Why would Brisbane have her killed?
- Because, because - She jilted him for someone else!
- Robitaille!
- Exactly!
We've done it!
- You've done it!
Yes, but you were standing very close by.
Wait a minute.
Are we saying here that a murder was committed by a monkey?
It's not so very far fetched!
It could be Brisbane's homage to Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue".
It's about a murderous orang-utan in Paris.
Wait till we tell Dad.
Dad!
No, Niles, wait!
It's still just a theory.
And how will Dad feel, knowing we've cracked a case he couldn't solve in twenty years?
Oh, dear.
You're right.
Wait!
It's serendipity that I stumbled into this.
It can happen again.
I'll rearrange the photos so that Dad will see the connection.
All right, we've got Coco, the gun and Helen.
What is it?
Oh, no, Frasier!
What are you doing?
No, no.
I've got these all set out the way I want them.
This one goes up I'll be damned!
Something wrong?
- Look at that!
- What?
I never thought it would leap out and bite me like this.
I may have solved this case.
- You have?
- Wonderful!
No.
Don't get too excited.
This is kind of far fetched.
It's a long shot, but it's beginning to make sense.
- Lay it out.
- Guys, please.
Give me a little privacy.
I've got to think.
- No problem.
- I was just going to bed.
Night, all.
Good night, Daphne.
Do you see the sparkle in his eye?
He's like a little kid at Christmas.
What happened to my entry-wound close-ups?
# Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la # - Hello.
Is Dad home?
- Nope.
I haven't seen him since he knocked me up.
- What?
- Knocked me up.
Woke me up.
It's an English expression.
What does it mean here?
Oh, something else.
You'd definitely be awake for it, though.
He went to the station to present his theory.
I wish he hadn't.
I've been turning it over in my mind all day.
The more I think about it, the goofier it sounds.
I mean, a monkey!
I hope they didn't laugh him out of the station.
It'd be one hell of an end to a 30-year career.
Now, now, Dr Crane.
It's not the most outlandish theory in the world.
You're right.
Could have said it was a trained giraffe.
I suppose he killed her by spitting the bullet at her, thus explaining the downward trajectory.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
- Heard anything from the station?
- Not yet.
I was afraid of that.
I knew my theory was iffy, but when I told the guys, they looked at me like I'd lost my mind.
- They didn't ridicule you?
- No.
They treat old-timers with respect.
They said, "I'll check it out", like I used to when some nut came in with aluminium foil in his hat, claiming the Martians were stealing his brainwaves.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what I was thinking of.
I've been trying to figure out how I came up with such a half-assed theory.
Dad It wasn't your fault.
I did it.
You killed her?
No, but I planted that ridiculous idea in your head.
Remember when you were upset I was rearranging your pictures?
I rearranged them so that you would come to the same conclusion I did.
- So you had the idea first?
- I feel terrible.
Don't blame yourself.
You put the foil on my hat, but I walked into the station wearing it.
I'll get it.
- Oh.
- Hiya, Marty.
Hey, Frank!
Frasier, Daphne, you remember Frank from the precinct.
- Marty, we've got to talk.
- About that theory of mine - What were you thinking?
- I know.
I feel so stupid wasting your time.
It cost us a whole afternoon and five detectives' time.
All we've got to show for it is - We got the bastard!
- I was right?
You don't believe me, ask these derelicts.
- Way to go, Marty!
- Good to see you.
Marty, you've still got it.
And it only took you 20 years.
- Mr Crane, I'm so proud of you!
- That's wonderful!
Oh, that's suede!
- So Marty, how did you do it?
- I thought it was Robitaille, and then I thought maybe it was Brisbane, but I was wrong.
How did you finally decide it was Detective Shelby?
That picture kept bugging me.
Why was she trying to write "help"?
Then it came to me: she wanted to write the killer's name, Shelby.
She died before she'd done the "b", someone kicked dirt over the "s".
You nailed him.
We interrogated him.
He cracked.
Sorry I doubted you, but you also wondered if a monkey could murder.
I may have momentarily doubted it, but I have to learn to trust my gift.
- Did you call the girl's mother?
- No, you do it.
You solved this.
I can't take all the credit for it, right, Frasier?
Get over here.
- Oh, now, Dad - Don't be shy.
I'm proud of you!
I was a cop for 30 years and it took my son with his PhD mind to crack it.
Plus I was standing next to him at the time.
- So, tell us about it, Frasier.
- Oh, no!
- Come on!
- Well, all right, then.
I hate to toot my own horn, but if it'll make Dad happy It was my expertise in human behaviour combined with enthusiasm for the Rwandan gorilla, that set me thinking about the monkey.
- I'm not sure I'm following you.
- I'm going too fast.
I'll go slower.
I figured out that, if Brisbane could teach a monkey to impersonate Washington, then he could teach a monkey to cock a revolver, sneak up a fire escape, pump Helen full of lead, then get away, perhaps wearing revolutionary war regalia to confuse witnesses.
In fact - and this is way out there - but check if there were any local bank robberies at the time, committed by a short, hairy man wearing a powdered wig.
You think the monkey was the killer?
When I said I was next to him, I was really most of the way across the room.
- Well, wasn't he?
- No, it was Shelby.
- Who's Shelby?
- A cop.
He was in love with Helen.
Oh.
Well, that was my second choice.
- Can I freshen anyone's drink?
- Help me out, Frasier.
What was the monkey's motive?
Jealousy?
Or maybe he just did it for the insurance money?
Hey!
Do you think we should put a tail on that monkey?
Listen, if that monkey did it, he'll swing for this.
- Yes, that's all very funny.
- You can take a joke, can't you?
I suppose I can, yes.
Wait!
I've got one!
Who will the monkey get to defend him?
Clarence Darrow!
The Scopes monkey trial.
You know, Darwin's theory of evolution.
It was turned into a Pulitzer prize winning novel "Inherit the Wind".
Is that gun loaded?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Allow me.
You're welcome.
When did everyone become so boorish?
Sometimes, I think I'm the only person with any sense of refinement.
Oh, smell my hands.
Thank you, no.
I'm so proud.
I had to stop for gas, and I pumped it myself.
- It's part of a new kick I'm on.
- What?
I'm learning to be handy.
I depend too much on others, so I'm doing it myself.
Feel that.
Surely the start of a first-rate callus.
- You left this in your booth.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
- A tape I rented for Dad.
It's our new Wednesday ritual.
Dad makes chilli, we watch an Angie Dickinson movie and I wish I was dead.
- You should join us.
- No, I got my first work shirt today and tonight, I'm tackling the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor.
Be sure to wear your hernia belt.
Roz, will you join us?
No, I'll just go sit over here.
Roz, are you trying to avoid me?
Yes, can you blame me?
You took a year to learn my name - You always make snide remarks.
- Name one.
You told me my bedroom was easier to get into than a community college.
I was hoping you'd name that one.
I've got half a mind to Just hold on!
You got off on the wrong foot.
If you two had a real conversation, you'd hit it off famously.
You sit and I will go and get your coffee.
So, how are you?
- Fine.
You?
- Great.
I'm handy now.
So that's a nice jacket.
- Thank you.
- It's offbeat.
What does that mean?
"Offbeat"?
- Well - I know.
Offbeat as in cheap.
I'm not rich enough to shop at the International House of Tight Ass like you and Maris the Heiress.
- That is what you meant, right?
- Yes, but I didn't think you'd get it.
- Then you were insulting me.
- You got in some good shots, too.
I did, didn't I?
I'm so glad we did this!
Sometimes I'm such a good therapist, I scare myself.
- Where's my briefcase?
- Isn't it under your chair?
Someone must have taken it!
Frasier, look, there it is!
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Is that your briefcase?
- Yes.
- Where did you get it?
- Some nuns in my parish bought it for me as a gift.
Then that would make you a priest.
Yes.
Well, then, father Perhaps you'd like to explain why you'd be carrying around a Bible and some rosary beads!
- What are you looking for?
- An Angie Dickensen movie.
I loaned it to the monsignor to give to you.
Apparently he forgot.
It's a two-day rental.
It doesn't matter.
I'm sorry.
It looked like yours.
They have the same inferior leather.
- I gave him that briefcase.
- I know.
Yes, I would mind holding.
I've already held three times.
I'm trying to report stolen credit cards but every five seconds Damn it!
Don't stare at me.
I'm a humane man, but right now, I could kick a kitten through an electric fan.
Hey, Frase.
Niles called.
Somebody stole your briefcase?
Go ahead, tell me how stupid I was to get taken advantage of.
Better than listening to "Jumping Jack Flash" for piano and flute.
You weren't stupid.
These guys are pros.
They need a second, and bam!
That's rather refreshing.
I thought you'd call me a naive dupe or - A bone-headed rube?
- But you're not.
No.
The important thing is you learned a lesson.
You gotta keep your guard up.
This world would be a happier place if everybody remembered two little words: "People stink"!
That's a little cynical for me.
I prefer to think of people as basically good and decent.
Yes, I am here, but I'm in the middle of a speech so you'll have to hold!
Truth is I enjoy my life that way.
If the price I have to pay is to replace a few credit cards, so be it.
Reminds me of when I moved to London.
I didn't trust people back then.
I tried to stay out of harm's way by walking with my eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance.
But I decided that was no way to live.
So one day, I lifted up my chin and took it all in.
The change was amazing.
There were sights I'd never seen, sounds I'd never heard.
A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his hand.
He needed help.
This was no city full of thieves and muggers.
People needed me.
I took his note, read it, and I still remember what I said to him: "That's not how you spell fellatio.
" So, whose point did she prove?
I have no idea.
It's been fun chatting with you all, nasty old Gertrude aside.
I'd like to close with a personal message.
This goes out to the person who stole my briefcase yesterday.
And also stole my dry cleaning with the claim ticket that was inside it.
You need help, and I am here to provide it.
Also, the double-breasted navy blue suit should be worn with French cuffs.
You may be sick, but you should be stylish.
Until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
Man, that was a great show!
It was better than great!
It was brilliant!
You What do you want?
- Remember I said I need Friday off?
- No.
You don't remember or I can't have Friday off?
Take one of each.
I'm feeling generous.
- Hello.
- 'Dr Crane?
' - Yes.
- 'Oh, man!
I can't believe I got through!
' My show is over.
Please call in again tomorrow.
- 'I'm calling cos I found your briefcase.
' - Are you sure?
- 'Pretty sure.
' - We can check.
In the upper right-hand corner, there's a water mark left by the careless resting of a champagne flute.
- 'It's full of your stuff, Dr Crane.
' - That works as well.
- Is everything still there?
- 'A pen, a set of car keys, a date book.
' - And what about my wallet?
- 'Sorry.
' That was asking for too much.
How can I get it back?
'I could drop it off.
' Meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike.
I'd be glad to give you a reward.
'Meeting you is reward enough.
Half an hour?
' That's perfect.
Bye.
- That was great.
- But not surprising.
- I told you to have faith in people.
- Yes.
People are basically good.
And fair.
We do nice things for people because of karma.
- You're not getting Friday off.
- Why?
Allow me.
Can you believe that?
That's the second time this week!
- I want to say something.
- Why don't you?
Something happens when I talk to a beautiful woman.
My knees turn to jelly.
You can only break people of bad habits by confronting them.
- That's true.
- So?
- Who's next here?
- I am.
No, you weren't next.
I am!
People like you who glide through life in a cosy cocoon of narcissism never notice such things!
But learn this lesson, sister!
There's still such a thing as good manners.
That's why I insist you let me buy you your coffee and please try the poppy seed muffins.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Kind of brutal, weren't you?
All I remember was "I was next" and the sound of blood in my ears.
Soon you'll be home with Maris and you'll forget about beautiful women.
- Let's sit here so we can see him.
- Your Good Samaritan?
Yes.
I'm feeling rather good about this whole thing.
I lost my wallet and my favourite suit but other things were intact: my date book, my spare car keys, my fountain pen.
But best of all, what remained intact is my sense that people are basically trustworthy.
The person who has your keys asks you could meet him here knowing you'd bring your car?
Before you launch into a paranoid riff, my car happens to be moving down the street!
Stop that well-dressed man!
Charlie, it's my son Frasier's car.
Could you put some extra manpower on this?
Yeah.
I know.
Fell for that old scam.
I told him to keep his guard up, but Frasier always knows better.
Mr Up-With-People.
Yeah.
Remember what we used to call guys like him on the force?
Hey, we're still talking about my son here!
Yeah.
I'll talk to you.
- Hi, Frasier.
How's it going?
- Terribly!
Guess what happened today.
- What?
- My car was stolen!
You're kidding.
I fell victim to a master criminal.
Did they hot-wire it?
Boy, those guys got fingers like concert pianists.
No.
He had the key.
A real pro.
Made a wax impression and then had a duplicate key made?
No.
It was the same miscreant that stole my briefcase.
He used the spare set that was inside.
He tailed you so he'd know where to find the car?
Not exactly.
He called the station and we agreed to meet.
- What for?
- Low-fat lattes and biscotti.
What are you, the town crier?
It doesn't shake my belief in the basic goodness of people.
Sure.
He's probably using your car to deliver hot meals to shut-ins.
I'm glad my misfortune's given you so much glee.
Dad, I have two requests.
First, wipe that smirk off your face.
I'm not a child.
What's the second request?
Can I borrow your car?
I want to go to the movies.
And last stop on our tour, my booth, where all the magic happens.
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Dr Crane needed a lift so I came up.
Just go on about your business.
It's not like I'm listening.
Have we had one visitor yet who didn't do that?
Thanks but we do have a show to do.
- People say I have a talent for this.
- Yes, of course.
Your soothing voice.
I could listen to you for hours.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
Absolutely.
Now get out.
- Could you get that?
- Hello?
Who's calling, please?
Just a second.
Denise.
She was out with you last night.
- I wasn't out with anyone of that name.
- Ooh, speakerphone!
All right.
Hello.
This is Frasier Crane.
'Hey, tiger.
I miss you already.
' I beg your pardon?
'You just snuck out this morning without giving me your number, 'and I woke up to see your BMW pulling down my driveway.
' You did?
'I'm not mad.
How can I be after my best first night ever with a man?
' Denise, could you hold on for a moment?
- Do you realise what this means?
- He told her he was you!
And it worked!
Nobody ever sleeps with me on a first date!
Hi.
'Sorry but I won't be able to meet you for that drink at Alberto's.
'The agency called.
They booked me for a swimsuit layout.
'There's my cab.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Kisses.
' Unbelievable!
He wasn't content to steal my possessions.
He wants my identity!
- I'm calling the police.
- No!
I am going to Alberto's!
- You have a show!
- Run "The Best of Dr Crane".
This jackal will meet me, not Denise!
- He could be dangerous!
- I don't care!
He's after my soul!
Shakespeare wrote, "He who steals my purse, steals trash.
But he who " Oh, I forget the rest, but it makes me good and mad!
Have you seen a man wearing an impeccably tailored Italian suit?
- Just you.
- Oh, well.
Thank you.
- Giorgio Armani.
- It's nice to meet you, Giorgio.
- My name's Heather.
- Frasier Crane.
Do you mind?
Wait a minute.
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio?
- Yes.
- I've heard your show.
You're great.
- Thank you.
- This is exciting!
Didn't you say that someone had impersonated you at the dry cleaners?
- Yes, someone did.
- You could be the impersonator.
If you're looking for identification, I - I thought so.
- He stole my wallet.
- Who did?
- Frasier did.
The bad Frasier!
You're pretty sick, you know that?
This is absurd!
Can't you recognise my?
Nice suit.
- Oh, my God!
It's you!
- No!
You're mine now!
All right.
I give up.
Damn it!
How did you find me?
Denise called to cancel your rendezvous.
- Great.
And I put on my best suit.
- No, you put on my best suit.
Well, I guess this is it.
Party's over.
I'm so stupid!
You probably want to call the police?
No.
I'd like to throttle you till your eyes shoot across the room like champagne corks!
But this is still a civilised world, though not for long if you have your way!
Every wallet you steal puts bars on someone else's windows.
Every purse you snatch puts mace on another key chain!
You make our lives less liveable and I hope that burns on your conscience!
What do you have to say for yourself?
You're right.
I see.
You think by agreeing with me, I'll let you off the hook.
No, you're right.
I'm guilty and I deserve what I get.
Your keys.
The car's out front with your briefcase in it.
Call the police.
That's your new car phone, by the way.
I upgraded.
I knew things would turn out like this.
Here comes the old sob story.
"My parents didn't love me, the bully next door stole my baseball glove.
" No.
Dad loved me.
Mom spoiled me and I was the bully next door.
- Let me do that.
It's kind of tricky.
- Thank you.
I myself am to blame for my problems.
Hi.
The number for the Seattle PD, please.
I take the easy way out of everything.
And you know why?
I'm lazy.
Lazy, lazy, lazy.
Oh, sweetheart, could you just connect me?
Thanks, hon.
Your life of crime is down to your laziness?
I don't like to work.
It's easier to take something than to work.
I'm a lazy criminal.
A briefcase here, car keys there, light shoplifting.
But a bank robbery?
All that planning!
Split-second timing.
Forget it!
And that second-storey stuff - grappling hooks!
Who does that?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're on hold.
Story of my week.
- You seem to be taking this well.
- It was bound to happen.
Perhaps you wanted to get caught.
Think about it.
You've taken ever-greater risks.
That's a man who wants to get caught.
I'm telling you.
Lazy!
Your pants.
You'd think I'd have them hemmed?
Staples.
Oh, dear God!
I still say that you really wanted to get caught.
- It's a classic cri de coeur.
- Cri de what?
It means you don't like the life that you're living.
It's not a great life.
I don't know where my rent's coming from, I have no solid relationship.
- Why don't you change?
- Gimme an 'L'.
Gimme an 'A' As a psychiatrist, I don't buy that.
You're not lazy.
You are afraid.
There are lots of things you could do legitimately.
You're afraid to try one of them and fail at it.
- You think I can change?
- Yes.
I believe in the basic goodness of people.
Yes.
Just a moment, please.
Start now.
Take responsibility for yourself.
For once, don't take the easy way out.
Hello?
Yeah, I'd like to report a crime.
He's the man who has been impersonating Frasier Crane!
- Let's go.
- What?
I am Frasier Crane.
- Do you have any ID?
- No, but it's true.
Tell them.
Thank God you're here.
I've detained him.
- What?
!
- But he's lying!
He's the impostor!
Don't you recognise me?
This is madness!
People of the world, listen to me!
Trust no one, especially that lazy bastard!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
If some guy grabs your parking space, you don't just sit there, say something!
Dad, a man with no front teeth and stitches on his nose can't take criticism.
- What's this?
- One of Daphne's inspirational tapes.
Oh, my God!
"Here, Have a Rainbow", by Dr Honey Snow.
How can you listen to this drivel?
It's awfully popular drivel.
She tells everyone they're wonderful and nothing's their fault.
What do you know?
They like it.
You should read one of her books.
I have.
After a page, I yearned for the worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur.
Niles, to what do we owe this pleasure?
- Brace yourself.
It's raffle time!
- Not again!
Yes.
Ye gods, who's been plumbing the shallows of Dr Honey Snow?
- I have.
- Insightful, isn't she?
Tickets are only ten dollars and support Maris' little opera group.
- What's the grand prize?
- Their lead soprano, Mrs Fitzgibbons, will come and perform "The Ride of the Valkyries".
We've sold 800 tickets so the risk is pretty minimal.
All right.
In return, a stock tip: Vectorcomp Software.
Wendell says they can't miss.
- Who's Wendell?
- My broker.
Every stock he puts me on to pays off.
He's clairvoyant.
I've got a bit tucked away.
Maybe I should take a chance with Wendell.
- It's not a sure thing.
- Nothing in life is a sure thing.
Dr Snow has a little saying: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
" She'd better copyright that before some hack steals it.
I'll go in for 500.
That's a lot for me, but I have a feeling I'm in for some luck.
I'd better get ready.
I'm off to the Book Nook.
Dr Snow's signing copies of her book.
What about my whirlpool therapy?
Oh, right, I forgot.
Would you go there for me, Dr Crane?
It's around the corner from the station.
I would sooner attend a hoedown.
I have my compulsive spending seminar and I hope to sell these tickets.
- What's the big deal?
- My reputation!
What's the big deal?
OK.
If it makes you happy to see me humiliate myself.
I always get a kick out of it.
Thanks ever so.
Look, everyone.
Eddie has found his "inner puppy"!
- This will just take a minute.
- I hope so.
I've barely got an hour.
Oh, God, not another Honey Snow book.
"Don't Change, You're Perfect.
" People go for this junk?
It's unbelievable.
Get her autograph for me?
Over there.
Get it signed then we'll have lunch at Le Cigare Volant.
- Me?
Why don't you do it?
- My reputation!
What's the big deal?
All right.
It's wonderful, isn't it?
I just love what she says about finding a moment each day to stop and give yourself a mental hug.
I'm giving myself one now.
Really?
Actually, it's more of a Heimlich manoeuvre.
- Got it.
- Good.
Let's buy it and go!
Not so fast.
She wants to meet you.
I don't want to meet the woman!
Do you know what she looks like?
I don't care.
The woman stands for everything I find totally enchanting.
Hello, I'm Dr Honey Snow.
And I'm Wait, don't tell me Dr Frasier Crane!
Dr Crane, let me shake your hand.
Oh, what am I saying - hug!
Why not?
After all, a handshake is just a hug for fraidy-cats.
No fear here.
- I am one of your biggest fans.
- I've recently become one of yours.
I think the advice you give is so brilliant, yet so simple.
What about those mental hugs of yours?
It can't get much simpler than that.
I'll go get started on my appetiser.
Yes, all I want is a little nibble.
Tell me!
I should go, but I'd love to talk more.
There seems to be such a positive energy between us.
My publisher's giving me a dinner tonight.
Would you come as my guest?
- I'd love to.
- That's great.
- Nice meeting you, Dr Snow.
- Please, it's Honey.
It certainly is.
- Good evening, Dr Crane.
- Good evening, Daphne, Dad.
- Oh, which horse did you wager on?
- Joe's Dream, number eight.
Goodness.
He's taking a serene, almost Buddhist approach to the race.
You should invest in something more reliable, like Vectorcomp Software.
- Our stock!
Did it go up a bit?
- No.
It went up a lot.
It gained 40% overnight.
Wendell advised selling, so, voilà, your original 500 plus 200 profit.
- That's a nice little dividend.
- I'll say.
What shall I do with it?
You could let Wendell reinvest it, like I am.
It's called rolling it over.
Then I'll do it.
This is so exciting.
What's all this?
Your brother just gave me $200, and now he's going to roll me over.
- Niles?
- Communications breakdown.
Good.
- Why are you dressed up?
Hot date?
- Yes.
- With whom?
- Dr Honey Snow.
Did it occur to you I might not want Niles to know?
Sure it did.
Right before I said it.
You're dating Dr Honey Snow?
You consider her a ninny.
What could you possibly see in this Ho ho, Mama!
One hell of a cute shrink!
No man wouldn't let her analyse his dreams.
Analyse them?
She could star in them.
But what do you say when she wants to discuss her work?
I just simply skirt the issue.
"Honey, your books are Oh, look, the waiter's on fire.
" You're jealous.
But not half as jealous as you're about to be.
Get a coaster for your lower lip.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Honey.
Let me introduce you.
Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.
Honey Snow, Daphne Moon.
She's a big fan.
- Hug.
- Hug.
We both have sort of unusual names: Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.
If you married my father, your name would be Honey Moon!
My father, Martin Crane.
Hello.
I see where Frasier gets his good looks.
Aw, get out of here!
- Last but not least, my brother, Niles.
- Oh, Dr Niles Crane.
I read a wonderful article you wrote: "Gestalt Therapy - Probing the Subconscious".
Yes!
And I believe I read your quiz in Cosmo: "Is your guy a stud or a dud"?
- Perhaps we should go.
- Not yet.
I want to give you this.
It's a manuscript of my next book.
Another one?
So soon?
I hope you like it because I'd love for you to write the foreword.
- Me?
- Who better?
Actually, there's so many other people more qualified to write for such an important work.
I almost think you don't want to do it.
Oh, no, it's a great honour.
I'll say.
The last book had an introduction by Mickey Rooney.
Then I'm writing that foreword!
That's great!
By next fall there'll be 500,000 copies with your name on the cover.
I've got my Christmas shopping done.
- Stop giggling.
It's distracting.
- Have you read this?
I'm trying to recommend the book.
Reading it doesn't help.
OK, here.
How's this?
"Many great volumes have been written about human behaviour, "and I can honestly say, without fear of contradiction, "that this book can stand on the shelf next to any of them.
" - No good, is it?
- No, but this is.
"You don't have to be a star to twinkle.
" Frasier, I need a hug.
Niles, will you please help me?
Honey asked me to write this and she's got a deadline.
"Time is a concept known only to man.
"Just for today, be a sunflower.
" Give me that!
You don't know what's at stake.
I've never felt this way about a woman.
I'm out of control.
Her effect on me is There's no words to describe it.
It's more like a sound.
Talking about Honey again?
Yes.
It's laughable to put your name on 500,000 copies of this piffle.
Not even piffle.
It's piffle-lite.
Lay off your brother.
Some women make guys do stupid things.
When I was on traffic duty there was a redhead who got away with anything.
She could be doing 90, a school crossing guard on her hood, she'd flash that pouty smile and I'd ignore my partner, wag my finger at her and send her on her way.
Yes, it's the old "good cop, horny cop" routine.
Good, you're all here.
I want to show off my new coat.
- Very nice.
- I've spent like a drunken yuppie.
I went a bit over my budget.
If you're concerned about cash flow, Wendell called today.
Again?
Four times in two weeks?
The man's a wizard.
Daphne, your profit.
$400!
Dr Crane!
And here's one for Wendell.
Did I mention Wendell has a secretary?
This calls for a celebration.
I'll take you all out for a nice dinner.
I'll just put on my new dress.
Put on your new shirt and corduroy slacks.
If you're buying I'm gonna wear elastic-waist pants and no belt.
Well, Niles, that broker of yours, he's a marvel.
Yes, he's doing wonderful things for me.
I'd say so.
I've been so impressed that I asked Daphne about it and invested a few hundred.
Really?
Well, congratulations.
Thank you but there's one thing that's hard to figure out.
Although I invested in the very same stock that Daphne did, mine declined and hers went up.
- How do you explain that?
- Obviously one of us is lying.
What are you up to?
This whole stock thing was a lie from the start.
No, first it paid off, but then it tanked.
What was I supposed to do?
Tell that working-class Venus I'd lost her life savings?
I paid her back with a bit extra.
Where's the harm in that?
Paying a woman for physical affection is the oldest profession.
Granted, it's the Walt Disney version.
But it's wrong.
I insist you stop it.
No, it's altruistic, noble and fun and you can't make me stop.
Dr Crane, take this $400 back and buy whatever Wendell says.
Consider it done.
I should get on that gravy train myself.
I'm in for 10,000.
Good lord.
$10,000, Dr Crane?
Think of the dinner I'll be able to buy when Niles brings me my profits.
Hell, put me down for 200!
This guy's some kind of genie.
He's a real treasure, isn't he?
I only hope those chest pains he complained about are indigestion.
Shall we go?
I've decided on Farmer Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.
I hear the chicken there is very good.
- Are you coming?
- You run along.
I'll take my car.
Well, I hope you're happy!
Snap out of it!
You're dishonest.
- Said the pot to the kettle.
- What?
- You know what it means.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Our situations are different.
- How so?
- You're selfishly misleading a woman.
- So are you!
- She also trusts you.
- And the difference is?
Your woman is English.
- Frasier, you've lost this one.
- I know.
It'll just take a little while to climb down off this particular high horse.
- I think you know what you have to do.
- Yes.
I have to tell her I can't write the foreword.
And I have to say goodbye to the chance of ever sleeping with absolute perfection.
Where, oh where will I have the chance again to gaze upon such extraordinarily proud and supple breasts?
Not to worry, brother.
That's the special at Farmer Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.
- Thanks for the wonderful dinner.
- Thank you for the fabulous table.
Hugging the maître d' really clinched it.
- Would you care for a nightcap?
- Sure.
You seemed tense all evening, but I have just the thing.
It's a sandalwood candle.
The scent is guaranteed to calm you down.
You better fire up about ten of those.
I'd really like to talk to you about that foreword I've been trying to write.
Can we not talk about work?
All day I've been researching an article on sexual intimacy.
I'm up to here with "The Joy of Sex" "Kamasutra", Masters and Johnson Really?
I feel like I've been reading recipes all day, only there are no groceries in the house.
Well, your bagboy has arrived.
I really need to discuss this now.
You're such a workaholic.
I only hope you're this tireless about everything.
Oh, you won't have any complaints.
I've got to focus on the subject at hand.
Frasier, tonight, I am the subject at hand.
No, no, Honey, I can't do it!
That's all right.
I have a candle for that, too.
No, I can't write the foreword.
Why not?
Well, I I didn't think it was a very good book.
I think the world of you and wish you success but the book isn't good enough to put my name on it.
I guess I'll be going now.
I am so attracted to you right now.
Most men will say anything to a woman to have sex.
How great to meet a man who would risk rejection rather than be dishonest.
Well, I have to be true to my inner voice.
I thought the book was weak myself.
I rushed it to meet a deadline.
I'm so glad you respected me enough to be honest.
I think honesty is the greatest aphrodisiac of all.
I hope you feel you can be as honest with me.
I do.
Tell me everything.
I don't want us to hide anything.
Your chapter titles were clumsy and jejune.
Your turn.
You use too much French in everyday conversation.
I think that sandalwood stinks.
When you talk about wine, I wish I had a gun.
I thought your first three books were trite and saccharine.
It's your turn, Honey.
Honey?
I'm immensely proud of my first three books.
As well you should be.
- You thought they were trite.
- I meant trite in its best sense.
As in the phrase, "trite and true".
- What about saccharine?
- I love it.
Use it every day.
I'm glad you like saccharine, darling.
Because there's no way you're getting any Honey.
Good night, Frasier.
Honey, I I'm sorry.
I really am.
Couldn't we try one of your forgiveness exercises?
- Good night, Frasier.
- Hug?
A poet once said something about the world that applies to us: "It ends not with a bang, but with a whimper.
"
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Well, that's all for today.
Don't forget Bob Bulldog Briscoe is up next.
Oh, yes!
This is KACL cash call week.
$5,000 if you answer your phone with the phrase that pays.
So don't say "Hello".
Say Well, blow me down!
No.
Say, "KACL is the talk of the town, talk of Seattle.
" Whatever.
Bye-bye.
Sam!
Oh, my God!
- What are you doing in town?
- I'm here interviewing for a job.
The Mariners need a pitching coach and called me.
They did?
I mean, that's great.
Come on in.
- You're off the air?
- Yes.
Frase, I got to go.
Your messages Whoa.
Who is this?
I'm Sam Malone.
I was a buddy of Frasier's in Boston.
Roz Doyle.
This is the Sam who has no respect for women and treats them like dirt?
Need anyone to show you around Seattle?
I'm all right with the city, but I get real lost in my hotel room.
Look at the two of you, face to face.
Wild animals everywhere are lifting their heads, alerted to the scent.
Bye, Roz.
If you need any company, give me a call.
- Snazzy card.
- It glows in the dark.
So do I. So how's everybody at Cheers?
Well, let's see Rebecca married that plumber.
She tries so hard to land a rich guy and ends up with an ordinary plumber.
He struck gold.
He's got a patent on some low-flow toilet thing.
He's rich beyond her wildest dreams.
- I'm happy for her.
- Don't be.
He dumped her.
- She's back at the bar.
- Working at Cheers again?
No, she's just back at the bar.
Here's some good news.
Woody and Kelly had a baby boy.
That is wonderful!
Is he?
No, he's smart.
Genetics takes a holiday, huh?
- Want to continue this over lunch?
- I'd like that.
- Norm and Cliff still holding up the bar?
- Norm is, but Cliff isn't.
He read about that flesh-eating bug and hasn't left his mum's house since.
It's good cos a lot of people who haven't been around are starting to come back.
Sam was a Major League ballplayer.
Put out the good china.
And don't forget the Limoges spittoon.
Sam's the most important person ever to set foot in this apartment.
This American obsession with superficial sports figures beats me.
Yeah.
They don't do anything important like sit on a throne or christen ships.
Niles, why didn't you bring Maris?
Ask Maris to spend an evening with a baseball player?
Why don't I just ask her to rub my shoulders?
- Here we are.
- Wow, look at this.
You got quite a babe magnet here.
Sam Malone!
I'm Marty Crane!
I'm one of your biggest fans!
I was at the Kingdome the night you gave up four consecutive home runs.
- I bet you remember that.
- No, that was during my drinking phase.
- Did I hit anybody?
Did I hurt them?
- No.
Hey, that was a good game then.
- This is my chair.
You want to sit in it?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, maybe later.
I'll keep it warm for you.
- This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Man, this is freaky.
He looks just like you did when I met you.
What happened?
It wasn't exactly a health club you were running there, Sam.
This is strange.
I didn't know he had a brother.
In all the time you spent swapping bon mots with the beer-nut set, you never mentioned you had a brother?
I bet he said something, but when he gets going, you have to tune him out.
Good slogan for his show: "When he gets going, you have to tune him out.
" What did he say about me?
The father, the old cop?
He told me you were dead.
- Dead?
- We had had an argument.
You called me a stuffed shirt and hung up on me.
You're a cop?
You told me he was a research scientist.
You were dead!
What did it matter?
Daphne, this is Sam Malone.
Daphne Moon, Dad's physical therapist.
Pleasure to meet you.
- Daphne's from England.
- I'm a sucker for the accent.
No matter what you say, it always sounds so classy and sophisticated.
See what I mean?
That kills me every time.
Let me get that.
You shouldn't spend your whole evening in the kitchen.
Is Sam flirting with Daphne?
Of course he is.
He flirts with everybody.
He's a sexual compulsive.
But he's getting help in a support group.
Did he miss a meeting?
Hello?
You'd like to speak to Sam?
- Who is it?
- Who's calling, please?
Sheila.
He's not here, but I'm expecting him soon.
- No!
Number two!
- I'm sorry.
I was mistaken.
He was here, but he left.
I'll give him the message.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Sam.
I'm a little out of practice.
So who's Sheila?
Just the woman I'm supposed to marry.
Marry?
When?
Oh, boy.
Yesterday.
- Yesterday.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But, Sam - Frase, please?
Something smells yummy here.
Wait a second.
I think it's me.
The smell And I thought Come on, Sam, one more.
- Vic Raschi.
- You're great!
You just have to give him the city, the date and the initials.
That's similar to a game Frasier and I play.
I'll go first.
viola section, initials CM.
- Czeslaw Milovicz.
- Wrong!
No, Milovicz was first viola the year before, but by '62, he'd developed rosin poisoning and couldn't pluck.
That's a trick question!
Well, I'm off to bed.
Thanks, Sam.
The chair's all yours.
Come on!
Oh, yeah.
That's very nice.
Night, all.
- I'm turning in.
- Pleasant dreams.
No problem there.
I'm off to my Maris.
If the clock strikes twelve and she hasn't felt my kiss upon her forehead, she gets nervous.
- It's been a pleasure meeting you.
- You, too.
You want to put a smile on Maris's face?
Let me tell you what you do.
Where would I find whipped cream and a car battery at this hour?
You got neighbours, don't you?
Now that everybody's gone, there was something I wanted to bring up.
What is it?
Oh, yes!
You were about to get married?
I met this girl six months ago and we were supposed to get married.
Yesterday, I was standing in this church and I hear this minister say, "Will you take this woman to be your wife"?
And I said, "Who, me"?
I ran down the aisle and didn't stop running till I got here.
You're not here for the Mariners?
No ballplayer is in Seattle for the Mariners!
All right.
Let's have a seat here and start this thing from the very beginning.
- Who is this woman?
- She's terrific.
Smart, funny, horny.
The kind of chick you want to stick up on a pedestal.
It's always amazed me how you can elevate and demean in the same sentence.
- What?
- Forget it, just How do you think she found me here?
I guess you left a lot of clues because you wanted her to find you.
I have a feeling you actually want to marry this girl.
Yeah, I don't know You just panicked.
It's perfectly natural.
The wedding ceremony represents the end of your old life.
I tell you, man, she's one in a million.
For most guys, that's just an expression.
I have a feeling that you're finally ready for a commitment like this.
- Get on that phone and call her.
- What would I say though?
Tell her the truth.
Honesty is the cornerstone of a healthy relationship.
Thank you.
It's time I stepped up to the plate and stopped acting like a kid.
The only question now is: will she still take you back?
- She forgave him?
- Yes.
She's on her way here.
They're getting married in Hawaii.
Same old story.
Love triumphs over Roz.
Don't be a sore loser.
I invited them here on their way in from the airport.
I remember my wedding day, feeling faint, shaking, sweating.
Maris was so distraught, thinking I had cold feet.
She was relieved to learn it was just a congenital heart murmur.
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam!
Here she is, the future Mrs Sam Malone.
- Sheila, Frasier.
- Nice to finally meet you.
Likewise.
This is Roz and Niles.
- Congratulations.
- You want to sit down?
Actually, it was a long flight.
I was hoping to go to the hotel and freshen up.
All right.
Will you join us for dinner about eight?
Sure.
Well, I guess we're off to freshen up a little.
- Oh, my God!
- She's not an "Oh, my God"!
No.
Not that "Oh, my God".
Oh, my God, I slept with her three months ago.
- You slept with her?
- Yes.
On what desert island with no hope of rescue was this?
I was in Boston for a long weekend.
I was feeling a little depressed so I took solace in the arms of a beautiful and remarkably welcoming young woman at a hotel bar.
- And that was she?
- No, Niles.
I told you that for no reason whatsoever Did you see the way she ran out of here the minute she saw me?
The trademark of all your bed mates.
Three months ago?
Sam said they'd been together for six months.
It looks like this horse race is on again.
Oh, put the weapon down!
Stop it, Roz!
Have you no scruples?
- You slept with your friend's fiancée!
- I didn't know!
- You have to tell Sam about this.
- And ruin our relationship and theirs?
I've got to speak to her first.
Hear her side of this story.
There are many reasons why people have affairs.
Roz, want to get us started?
Maybe they stopped seeing each other for a couple of weeks.
Or he cheated on her and she was getting even.
Maybe she just found me irresistible.
Oh, yeah, that's it!
You struck gold there.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Sheila.
Good to see you again.
Sam, you are one lucky guy!
- He's out getting our plane tickets.
- You have some explaining to do.
- OK.
Wine?
- No, thank you.
I know this doesn't excuse what I did, but I had no idea that you were a friend of Sam's.
I'm a sexual compulsive.
That's how Sam and I met, in group.
That night I spent with you, I guess I just fell off the wagon.
I felt awful afterwards.
It ended up being a turning point for me.
That's how it is with addiction.
Before you get better, you have to hit rock bottom.
Yes.
Well I'm glad I could be down there for you.
Listen, Frasier, I'm human.
I made a mistake.
Can you understand that?
Of course I can understand.
I've had many patients that share your affliction, although only you can hit the emergency button of an elevator with a stiletto heel.
I love Sam.
I'll do everything I can to make this marriage work.
You seem sincere about this.
I think I can support this marriage.
But if you start to feel yourself slipping, here's my number.
No, no.
So I can help you as a psychiatrist!
Thank you.
I think it's probably best if we don't tell Sam about the two of us.
Not that I have a guilty conscience.
I'm back.
You all right?
Got a little charley horse.
- Did you get the tickets?
- Yeah, I did.
They're right here.
I'm so happy.
By this time tomorrow, we'll be Mr and Mrs Sam Malone.
I want to talk to you about that.
Frasier said something the other day that really stuck in my mind.
What did I say?
That thing about honesty being something of something It was pro-honesty.
Being the cornerstone of a good relationship?
Right.
That really stuck in my mind.
- I haven't been honest with you.
- What do you mean?
When we get married, I want us to have a clean slate, sweetheart.
I hope you can forgive me for this, but a few months ago, I had a slip.
It was two slips, but they were simultaneous, so I'm counting it as one.
Was this after you were engaged?
Actually, it was that night.
I'm so sorry.
It has not happened since and I swear it will not happen again.
- I forgive you.
- You do?
I'm relieved.
I have something I need to confess to you.
You're not the only one who slipped.
You should have a little privacy.
No, you're responsible for getting us this far.
We have no secrets.
All right.
Who?
That's what makes it so tough.
It was someone from Cheers.
I parked in a loading zone!
Sam, I slept with Paul.
Paul?
- Short?
- Bald?
- Fat?
- Paul?
I didn't say he was good.
All right.
I understand that.
You were giving Paul a break or something.
I can forgive that.
Isn't this all about forgiveness?
OK.
You told one, you told one.
We're all even.
Let's go eat.
- There was someone else.
- Are we still on this?
I mean, there is honesty and there's beating a dead horse!
- It doesn't matter who it is.
- Yes, it does matter.
This one is really embarrassing.
I was lonely, I was desperate and I'd just been to the eye doctor and my pupils were dilated.
Oh, Sheila, for God's sake!
I'll tell him.
She's trying to say It was Cliff.
I believe she said Cliff.
Cliff?
Cliff?
You slept with Cliff?
Cliff!
No, that's it!
Wedding's off!
Cliff!
Oh, God!
Frasier, you've got to help me.
You've got to talk to him.
I slept with a woman who slept with Cliff?
This will be a long flight home.
- You made the right decision.
- Yeah, I suppose.
Jeez!
Cliff!
You're just using Cliff as the excuse.
There were more compelling reasons for you to back out of this thing.
No, it was Cliff.
To put this thing aside once and for all, I You're probably the only friend I have who she didn't sleep with.
Cliff!
That is a tough one to swallow, huh?
But you proved yourself ready for a commitment, even if Sheila wasn't the one.
- I suppose so.
- In a way, we're both in the same boat.
- What do you mean?
- We've tried, we've failed.
But we'll try again.
We're looking for a meaningful relationship.
That's the word, "meaningful".
- We'll find it though, buddy.
- You bet we will.
Stewardesses usually hang out at the airport bar.
That says "meaningful" to me.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Dad!
Daphne!
Anybody home?
I still think you're making too big a deal out of this.
Dad, I've never seen Maris this angry.
I swear her eye was twitching like a frog in a science experiment.
When your mother got mad at me, I'd bend her backwards and give her a kiss.
I can't do that with Maris.
She has abnormally rigid vertebrae.
She'd snap like a twig.
Let me guess, Maris moved into the east wing again?
Sunday was her 40th birthday.
She said she wanted no acknowledgement.
In a moment I live over and over in my dreams, I believed her!
No gifts, no party, no nothing?
Say that weeping into a lap robe and you've got her down perfectly.
- Just get her a nice bottle of perfume.
- She gets hives.
- How about candy?
- Hypoglycaemic.
- Just get her a dozen roses?
- Allergic.
Just sit her down and tell her it was a mistake.
She's touchy about her age.
Even though it's not the first time she's turned 40.
I know.
I'll throw a big party this weekend.
A costume ball with a Louis XIV theme, right down to the wigs and velvet pantaloons.
I presume you both have colds?
And so it goes.
Did you find a book lying around?
The station manager loaned it to me.
"The Life of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree".
A history of English theatre.
You caught me.
It got it hidden under my pillow.
Try to be helpful.
I promised I'd return it today.
Ask Daphne.
She wanted something to put her to sleep.
That book could put her into a coma!
- Dr Crane!
- Daphne!
What are you doing in my room?
You were out.
Not that I come in here when you're out.
I came in to get my book.
Which I have, you see.
We'll just be going.
Me and my book.
See Frasier go.
Nadia, tell Mrs Crane I want to speak to her and don't take no for an answer.
Then tell her Dr Crane says please, please, please, please - Maris hung up on you?
- She's got Nadia doing her dirty work.
Nadia is Maris's hatchet maid.
What happened to the French guy party?
Disaster too.
A branch of Maris' family was slaughtered by the Huguenots.
Let's forget about Maris and have a nice meal in a convivial atmosphere.
- What is she mad about?
- Beats me.
Your favourite, Mr Crane.
Creamed onions.
And Dr Crane, special glazed carrots just for you.
You, carve!
We don't know what she's mad at but we know who.
If anyone needs me I'll be in me room.
You know where that is!
- What did you do?
- I went into her bedroom.
Frasier, how could you!
No matter how irresistible the urge to press your face against the door, to actually feel the grain of the wood against your cheek, it must be fought!
I went in to retrieve my book.
- You're not supposed to go in there.
- What's the big deal?
- She doesn't like people in there.
- I let her in my room.
- Women are different.
- That's sexism.
No, it's 35 years of marriage talking.
Women protect their privacy.
You never go in their handbags.
It's always, "Bring me my purse.
" A husband is being robbed at gunpoint and has no money.
The wife still says, "Bring me my purse.
" Your homespun wisdom has pricked the balloon of Frasier's pomposity.
You were wrong, so go in there and apologise.
Go on.
All right.
I'll go into Daphne's room and I will apologise to her.
Alone, Niles!
- Yes?
- Daphne, it's Dr Crane.
Yes.
Could you open the door, please?
I behaved very insensitively this morning and I did need the book but it was wrong of me to go in without your permission and I'm sorry.
It'll never happen again.
Ever.
I'm being very nice.
Well, good night, Daphne.
Wait.
I'm being much too hard on you.
I'm sensitive about my privacy.
No need to explain.
It will never be an issue again.
Thank you for being so understanding.
My problem goes back to growing up in a house of boys.
My brothers were snoops.
They gave me no peace.
It was a filthy rite of passage for the Moon boys.
They'd sneak into the bathroom and peek at me in the shower.
Dear God.
All eight of them?
Except for my brother Billy, the ballroom dancer.
He never peeked at me.
Though he did peek at my brother Nigel.
Coffee, Dad?
Why not?
I'm up six times a night.
I might as well be alert.
Jeez, the disposal's jammed.
Stick your hand down there and see what's stuck, will you?
Dad, it's me, Niles.
I can't get my hand in.
Punish a man for being fine-boned.
- Sure it's off?
- Positive.
Move away from the switch.
It's wet and slimy.
Like sticking my hand into the mouth of hell.
Call me when the coffee's ready.
- Sorry, Niles.
- That's enough excitement.
- I'm going home to Maris.
- She's speaking to you?
No but she tires of being frosty to the help.
I'm out of cash.
I need something to tip your garage attendant.
Oh, great.
These pills.
I was thinking money but you know him better than I do.
No, no.
Daphne's prescription.
When I was in her room I must have inadvertently knocked them into my pocket.
An interesting phenomenon.
I can't go into a drugstore without aspirin leaping into my trousers.
OK, I was snooping around a little bit.
Oh, God.
"Take one before bedtime".
She'll miss these.
- You off, Dr Crane?
- Yes, I am.
- Say hello to your wife.
- I'll try.
Mr Crane, time for your exercises.
Great.
I'll just put these back in her room.
Alone, Niles!
The game's on.
I'll exercise tomorrow.
Fine.
I'll be in my room.
- You'll do double tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Grumpy old sod.
What're you doing?
That's disgusting!
You filthy thing.
Get out!
Daphne, I'm so sorry!
Good morning, Frasier.
Cara mia, un mezzo latte decaffeinato and a bran muffin.
No, no due bran muffins.
Maris and I burned up a lot of energy last night.
A lot of energy!
I have to replenish ma body.
You achieved détente?
Twice.
What did you say to melt your little glacier?
I stared deeply into her eyes and said, "Maris, here are the keys to your new Mercedes.
" You bought her a Mercedes.
Yes.
The things that tiny woman can do when motivated.
If you're done marinating in your testosterone, I have a problem.
Remember I went back into Daphne's room?
- She caught me again.
- You're joking!
I was so embarrassed, I left before she awoke.
I wrote a note to explain.
Considering the circumstances, how can she forgive me?
It wasn't as bad as all that.
It's not like you saw her naked or something.
You did!
I took no pleasure in it at all.
The entire thing was mortifying.
I want to help you, so tell me everything before you explode.
No, Niles!
I'll show you how I imagine her and you tell me where I'm wrong.
Stop it.
Put your pen away!
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Roz, good to see you.
So, Niles, you randy dog.
You got lucky last night, didn't you?
I can always tell.
Don't worry.
You'll meet somebody.
A non-fat cap, please.
Roz, this was private.
I'm helping with a matter of some delicacy.
Don't worry.
Shower boy told me about it.
How can I make this up to Daphne?
Nothing says sorry like an in-dash CD player and a passenger airbag.
Maris was upset so he bought her a Mercedes.
You're suggesting I buy my way out.
That's the coward's way out.
- So I'm a coward?
- Yes.
Well, I'm a coward with a hickey.
Buy me a Mercedes, I'll make your neck look like a relief map of the Andes.
Don't encourage him!
Bribery is the wrong way to resolve conflicts.
During which failed marriage did you hone that theory?
How dare you, considering your non-marriage!
Dr Crane, I'm glad to see you.
I need some advice.
I got this son who's a total numbnut.
Hello, Dad.
Love your icebreaker.
Get her to stay.
She knows my moods and I like her.
- She's talking about quitting?
- Yeah, so get in there and apologise.
Dad, I can't go in there.
No you can't, because I asked you to.
I said, "Don't go," you went.
I say, "Go," you won't.
Unlike Eddie, he does what I say.
Come on, Eddie.
He's defying you too, Dad.
Daphne, please wait.
We've got to talk.
I feel terrible.
Dr Crane, your note explained everything.
You've nothing to feel bad about.
- That puts my mind at ease.
- We servants don't deserve privacy.
Matter of fact, why don't we get it out in the open?
Here's my bank book, letters, and my driver's licence.
You see I'm 4lbs heavier now, but it's in a spot that doesn't show to most people!
I realise it's hard to live in someone else's home.
Yes, it is.
But I put up with it because I happen to love this job.
All I ever asked for was one room, a little corner I could call my own.
I never minded I was up to my eyeballs in your earth tones and African knick-knacks.
But I have to put up with you and that's a leering love god too many!
Oh, Daphne.
You're right, you do deserve a place of your own.
If you stay, I'll pay to have your room redecorated.
Just make it your own.
Paint, wallpaper.
Anything so you feel comfortable.
How about an electrified fence and a German police dog?
I promise as long as we live under the same roof, I'll never set foot in your room again.
- All right.
- Thank you.
I'll give it another try.
- Hello.
- Hello and goodbye, Dr Crane.
- Where are you off to?
- Shopping.
Your brother offered to have my room redecorated.
Really?
I'm thinking of doing the whole thing in pinks and yellows.
She's really determined to keep me out of there.
So you're putting things right by opening your chequebook.
I know what you're thinking.
It's just a gesture.
I give Maris a car, it's a bribe.
You decorate Daphne's room, it's a gesture.
It's different.
You bought Maris off because you are afraid of her.
And you're not the slightest bit intimidated by Daphne.
So you won't be alarmed if I do this.
Niles, where are you going?
- My foot's in Daphne's room.
- Get out.
Afraid you'll get in trouble?
- Now we're safe.
- Stop it!
Trouble safe trouble safe.
Niles, you're acting like a child.
- Trouble, safe, trouble, safe - See what you've done.
Oh, well, so you'll just write her a bigger, fatter cheque.
No, Niles, she'll quit!
- What!
Why didn't you say?
- Oh, you spilled - What the hell are you doing?
- It's Niles's fault.
Daphne, did you see that sporty little sub-compact over there?
Is that a Mercedes dealership across the street?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
We've time for one more, Roz.
We have Sid on three.
Hello, Sid.
I'm listening.
'Hello, Dr Crane.
I fear talking on the phone to people I do not know.
'I freeze up.
'It is a severe handicap in today's fast-paced world.
' Are you reading what you're saying?
'Yes, I am.
'The only way I can communicate is to write out everything in advance.
' What if someone asks you something you haven't anticipated?
'Thank you for your insightful comments.
Goodbye.
' Wait!
Sid!
Sid, your insecurity lies in your fear of making a mistake.
You have to practise.
If you work at it, you too may achieve the command and confidence to which we all aspire to be having.
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health.
- That was a show good.
- Thank you, Roz.
- Knock, knock.
- What are you doing here?
Want to go to lunch next week at the Empire Club?
- You know a member?
- No.
But you may.
What are you up to?
You had that same look when you found Flagstad's 1932 "Götterdämmerung".
If all goes well, my lapel will be sagging under the weight of a membership pin.
You'll fit in with those blue bloods who wouldn't even spit on the rest of us.
Don't jinx it.
I'm not in yet.
There's still a party where they screen prospective members.
- How did this come about?
- I thank Maris.
She spent years cultivating relationships until fortune smiled on us.
Old Judge Clements suffered a stroke and a vacancy opened up.
Gives new meaning to "a stroke of luck".
It gets better.
There are actually two vacancies.
Edgar van Cortland was indicted in a scandal.
Frasier, I think my time has come.
- I'm very happy for you.
- That's generous of you.
Especially as you've dreamed of a membership.
A lesser man would be jealous.
- You're not?
- No.
- They have a planetarium.
- So?
I think my work here is done.
- So he's getting into the Empire Club?
- It appears so.
He deserves to have lunch in that private dining room, read in that fabled mahogany library.
- It's eating you?
- Like a bacteria.
If he gets in, I should too.
What if I know someone who could get you invited?
- Don't toy with me.
- Mr Strickland, please.
It's Roz.
- Walter Strickland Junior?
- Senior.
- How do you know him?
- The less you know, the better.
I need more comfortable shoes.
My dogs are killing me.
- Pardon?
- My "dogs".
My feet.
- What do you call them in England?
- By their rightful names.
Except Uncle Harold.
He named his anatomy after the royal family.
He walked on the Queen's pins, sat on the Duchess of Kent.
A jolly fellow until Aunt Kate caught him introducing the Prince of Wales to a waitress.
- Are you almost finished?
- Yes, I am.
You'll have the handsomest midriff.
- I hope my date concurs.
- Who are you taking?
Dr Susan Anderson.
She's as boring as toast but a brilliant physician and socially well-connected.
Isn't Niles a little ticked off?
Yes, but I convinced him if we work together we'll secure both vacancies.
It's like when you were kids.
If one has something, the other has to, too.
I had to buy two Balinese lutes, two découpage kits, two pairs of lederhosen.
When you moved out, that was one embarrassing garage sale.
- Hello, Niles.
- Ready?
- No.
Susan's at the hospital.
- Where's Maris?
In the Mercedes practising her vivacious giggle.
Let's go over our strategy.
I made a crib sheet on each member.
"School ties, business affiliations, hobbies, mistresses.
" I also researched our competition.
Don't worry.
One of them flies coach.
We're as good as in.
Unless I just had a terrifying thought.
What if another candidate researched the skeletons in our closet?
Damn it!
- That's as bad as it gets.
- I wouldn't be so sure.
They wouldn't look kindly on your arrest for mooning President Nixon.
I was young and firm and in love with an anarchist.
That's minor compared to your suicide attempt.
It was not a legitimate attempt.
I did it to get Lilith's attention.
Maris and I should head over.
The others will get a leg up on us.
- Good idea.
See you there.
- Bye, Dad.
Hello.
Oh, Susan, I've been expecting you.
Are you in the car?
No!
You're still at the hospital?
Of course I understand.
You were a sweetheart to agree to go in the first place.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Fat chance.
- Stood you up?
- This is disastrous.
- Just go stag.
- I'd look like I couldn't find a date.
Why are we worried?
We got a Cinderella right under this roof.
That's the last time I get grout up without wearing rubber gloves.
I've so much gunk under my nails, I look like I've been worming a pig.
Trust me, the English accent will sell it.
Oh, yes.
It's everything I ever imagined it would be and more.
What's that smell, Dr Crane?
That's power.
Call me Frasier.
People mustn't know you work for me.
We've dated for six months.
All right, Frasier.
Anything else, Frasier?
Are we in love or is this just a physical thing, Frasier?
Stop that.
Oh, Niles.
How goes the chase?
Brilliantly.
Daphne.
- Good evening, Dr. Crane - What are you doing here?
Frasier takes me everywhere, don't you, sweetheart?
I'll go sample some hors d'oeuvres.
Back in a minute, darling.
- Sweetheart, darling?
- My date cancelled.
Daphne's filling in.
You think I'd go out with Daphne?
You are a man.
She is a goddess, whose bedroom is only 41 steps from your own.
Where's Maris?
Apologising to another candidate's wife.
Maris bumped a dish of crabmeat into the woman's décolletage.
- Accidents will happen.
- As long as the hors d'oeuvres flow.
My God.
Feel this leather.
I have had pudding stiffer than this.
Frasier, Kenneth Spencer.
I'm sure it was satisfying being Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, but surely you would have been happier at Princeton?
Anyone who's anyone went there.
Excuse me, I'm Kenneth Spencer.
As it happens, I went to Princeton.
No!
What are the odds?
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
My brother, Dr Niles Crane, the eminent psychiatrist.
He's too kind.
He was eminent when my eminence was merely imminent.
Try this caviar, Frasier.
I met the most charming gentleman, Edgar van Cortland.
I thought he lost his membership in a scandal.
He was acquitted and reinstated into the club.
- Oh, he was innocent.
- No.
Just acquitted.
So there's only one membership?
Yes.
But if one is selected you can bring the other as a guest.
If only one can become a member, I hope it's you.
- That's noble.
- I know what it means to him.
We can't risk another suicide attempt.
That's amusing, using humour to defuse a tense situation.
I'm sure that helped when you were in prison.
- Kenneth.
- Excuse me.
Stop it!
Do you intend to run each other down and ruin both your chances?
- You're right.
- Thank you.
Cocktails?
Yes.
Your best 18-year-old Lowland single-malt Scotch.
- A discriminating choice.
- He has good knowledge of spirits from his years shacked up with a barmaid.
Mum says, "Why can't I meet your boyfriends"?
I say, "The plane trip takes four hours - longer than my relationships last.
" There's Niles.
Don't look at him.
Pretend we don't see him.
Real mature.
Thanks to him I can't say the phrase I've rehearsed for a lifetime: "If you need me, I'll be at my club.
" This is so boring.
You owe each other an apology.
Yes, but I apologised first last time.
That means it's his turn.
Goody!
I can be mature about this.
- Niles.
- Frasier.
After last night, an apology is in order.
I agree.
Well?
- Well what?
- I apologised first last time.
- No, you didn't.
- I did.
After the Monet exhibit.
My secretary left a heartfelt apology with your service.
So you did.
It is my turn again.
Damn!
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.
I'm a terrible person.
- We just turned on each other!
- It was embarrassing.
My only excuse is that all my life I dreamed of belonging to a club.
As a child, when I formed clubs with my bears, some didn't make it.
Hello.
Yes, this is Dr Crane.
It's the club.
Yes?
I see.
Thank you for considering me.
If you'd care to speak to my brother, he's here.
Be gracious.
Yes, I see.
Thank you very much for calling.
Goodbye.
Don't let it get you down.
We were fine without them before.
We're fine without them, aren't we?
Oh, my God.
You got in.
Congratulations.
I'd better go break the news to Maris.
Niles, your getting passed over drains every drop of joy from this.
Thank you.
You're a good brother.
Yes!
I got in!
Shout it from the rooftops!
Lattes for everyone!
This is the proudest day of my life!
Of course what really matters is family.
Beg.
Come on.
We've worked on this.
You can do it.
Beg.
Sit.
Good boy!
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him a trick.
- With my imported prosciutto?
- It's worth it.
- Not unless he can sing from "Tosca".
- Where are you going?
The Empire Club.
I've come to a moral decision.
I will insist they give Niles my membership.
That's a hell of a gesture.
I put myself in Niles' place.
He's spent 15 years trying to climb Seattle's social ladder.
Then within two years, I'm known throughout the city and I grab the prize he's wanted most of all.
It just isn't fair.
- You're a good kid.
- Thank you, Dad.
I'll say this while I still can If anyone needs me I'll be at my club.
Yes, the club.
The club that I helped you get into.
Now you're done with me, I'm just cast aside.
Unappreciated, unloved and forgotten.
I see the prosciutto isn't the only imported ham in the house.
Give me your shirt.
I need a full load.
- Anything white?
- Yeah, but you're not getting them.
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
Dad.
Niles.
Just passed Frasier.
Where was he off to?
He went to the club.
No wonder he was evasive.
I hope you don't mind my stopping by.
I had no place else to go.
Niles, you may get into that club yet.
- What?
- He went to give his spot to you.
Is this a sick joke?
You should be happy.
He's giving up his own membership.
What would I be happy about?
This is humiliating.
My brother going to make them take me?
His heart's in the right place.
Dad, they made their decision.
I don't want their pity.
I don't care if they invite me now, even if they BEG!
Good boy!
Excuse me, is the Club President here?
Yes, Mr Drake is over there.
Thank you.
Mr Drake?
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- Yes, of course.
The new blood.
Please sit down.
Sir, I've come here on a matter of personal business.
It's about my brother Niles.
Niles is sort of My God.
This leather's as soft as a baby's bottom.
On family night we bring babies in and do a blindfold comparison test.
That's a joke, Crane.
Yes, indeed.
Darn good one too, sir.
My brother may seem priggish but he's the most discriminating man I know.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger snob in this room.
Excuse me, sir, a glass of port?
- 1896?
- What are you saying, Crane?
Glad to be aboard, sir.
No, I came down here to say that my brother deserves membership more than I do and I want to step down in his favour.
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.
After all, blood is thicker than port.
- I stand corrected.
- Let me be candid with you, Crane.
We were quite firm about accepting anybody in the entertainment business.
Radio psychiatrist falls into that category.
Radio psychiatrist?
But Niles - There's been a mistake.
- No, there hasn't.
Dad said you'd try to get me in your club.
Don't bother.
I don't need you to fight my battles.
- But - Butt out.
You've made it clear how you feel, so I'd like to share how I feel.
I'd sooner spend time in a bus station than spend one moment with you smug bigwigs with your oriental carpets and overstuffed chairs My God, it's like a baby's bottom!
You can't reject me because I reject you.
Yes, I'm talking to you, fuzzy.
I prefer being Niles Crane, everyman.
Friend of the average Joe.
Niles, they got our names mixed up.
I didn't get in.
You did.
What?
It was you they wanted.
I'm in?
Good God, don't just stand there.
Fetch me some port.
Escort these gentlemen out.
You can't think I meant the things I said.
Excuse me, sir, I must ask you to leave.
You and who else?
Niles, we don't need this club.
Let us leave with dignity.
No.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I could just come part time.
Perhaps just one afternoon.
Thursday's a slow day.
I wouldn't talk to anyone.
I could just sit in a chair.
Please!
Let me stay.
I belong here!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Brian, let me assure you, no one is a born scatterbrain.
Just develop your powers of concentration.
On a trip to the Amazon I observed the hunters of the Shipibo tribe.
With only a crude blowgun they bring down monkeys from the forest canopy.
How?
Focus and mental discipline.
We must work on that.
Focus on one thing and not get distracted We've been nominated for a SeaBea!
But not so single-minded that we can't be spontaneous.
We'll be back.
Oh, Roz!
This is wonderful!
Two years in a row!
They like me!
They really like me!
I have to lose five pounds in two weeks!
That'll be enough of that.
Oh, Roz, I bought this for you this morning.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to say it was just for being you.
Thanks, Frasier.
This is great!
Last year I wanted to win so much I didn't even enjoy it.
This year, I don't care.
I'll buy a beautiful dress, have my hair done, stretch out in the limo with my date Why bother having your hair done?
Hey, Doc!
Congratulations!
Hey, Roz!
Oh, OK.
Congratulations to you, too.
Four nominations, three wins.
I've been a symbol of broadcasting excellence in Seattle since 1991.
See ya, Doc.
- 30 seconds.
- Whom do we have?
Line one is a Bainbridge shoplifter.
Line two is your "No.
1 fan.
" - Kari?
- Fourth time this week.
All she does is gush and say you're wonderful.
And this hurts me how?
Hello, Seattle.
Time for one call.
So, Roz, who do we have on the line?
Oh, please.
- Hello.
You're on with Frasier Crane.
- 'Hi, Dr Crane.
It's me, Kari.
'Nervous as usual.
I hope you're not sick of me.
I think you're wonderful.
'Thank you for talking to me.
- Thank you for being so sweet.
- 'Thank you for giving good advice.
' Thank you for Sorry.
If that's all - 'That was a beautiful rose you bought.
' - I bought it for - Excuse me?
- 'Don't be surprised.
I saw you.
- 'Not your regular routine.
' - My regular routine?
'Café Nervosa.
You go every morning.
Except today.
I'm boring you.
Bye.
' Goodbye, Kari.
That's all for today, Seattle.
Goodbye and good listening.
That was weird.
She's following you?
She's hardly following me.
She may go to Café Nervosa.
The florist is next door.
Be careful out there.
There's a lot of creeps.
I've met lots of odd people and I've never called any of them a creep.
Stop wearing corduroys.
I can't see your panty line.
Although, some people do send me groping for synonyms.
- What are you up to?
- Measuring your father for his tuxedo.
That reminds me.
Maris can't make your awards.
Colour me surprised.
Any reason?
Yes.
It's a good one.
She's upset about her manicurist.
She's done Maris's nails for years and she's been taken critically ill.
How bad is she?
She'll be fine when she finds another manicurist.
For now she's curtailed all public appearances.
I'm sorry.
It's not like I'm nominated every year.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes, it is!
As someone once said, "Popularity is the hallmark of mediocrity.
" - You just made that up.
- Yes, but I stand by it.
Are you joining us for dinner, Dr Crane?
No.
We're going to the opera.
- We're seeing - "Der Fliegende Holländer".
Don't forget the tickets are in your briefcase.
I can hear that first aria.
Don't, Niles.
You'll sing it, then I will, and I won't get it out of my head!
What's this?
"Dear Dr Crane.
A little bit of me to wrap around your neck.
"Your No.
1 fan, Kari.
" How sweet.
Your fan knitted you a scarf.
My case was with me all day, expect at the barber's.
That didn't give her more than 30 seconds.
She followed you then slipped a scarf into your case?
- She's a devoted fan.
- With the handwriting of a sociopath.
Big loops.
That's how they caught the "Butcher of Brighton".
He used big loops.
A sign of anger.
He crossed his T's downwards, indicating aggression.
He also kept a Demitasse saucer full of eyelids on his night table.
Should we put a two-way lock on her door?
There are weirdos around, so keep your eyes open.
She's not weird.
She just finds me fascinating.
The distinction would be?
Her invading my space is inappropriate but I hardly think we should barricade the door.
First phone calls, then spying, then she was in your briefcase.
The predator is stalking its prey in ever narrowing circles or "loops".
- That's for you, Daphne.
- Thank you.
You make me sound like a goat being staked out.
No one's hunting me down.
No one is closing in on me.
Look!
These must be from the station!
"From your No.
1 fan, Kari.
"Your time has come.
You're going to get what you deserve.
" The loop tightens.
Stop it, Niles!
She means it's time I won this award.
You will not turn me into a nervous wreck.
It's just not going to happen!
'I don't understand it.
I'm a successful guy.
'I have my own car dealership, but I'm depressed.
'You may have heard of me - Madman Martinez.
' What's the source of your depression, Madman?
'I guess it's just that business is down.
I don't know why.
'I slashed prices this week.
'I've an '88 Olds Cutlass on the lot 'in rare turquoise metallic, cordova roof, leather 'And there's six brand-new Supras, with a 20% discount to listeners.
'People say, "You're crazy"!
I say, "I deal in volume"!
' Fortunately, so do I. Our time's up, folks.
Stay tuned for Bob Bulldog Briscoe after these paid commercial messages.
Roz, you're supposed to screen the calls.
Just douse me in gasoline and toss me a match.
I hoped a stern warning would do.
I'm talking about this.
Three hours till a limo picks me up and my nose erupts like Krakatoa!
- It's barely noticeable.
- From where?
The space shuttle?
Vintage Roz, or what?
I finally lose five pounds and I gain three of it back on my nose!
I'm sure that with enough foundation and some contouring, maybe a little shadowing.
Have you considered wearing a beekeeper's mask?
Do I make fun of that astrodome you call a forehead?
It's been a tough week for me, too.
Kari's put notes in my briefcase.
She's even been to my apartment.
You have to do something.
Remember Leo the Happy Chef?
He had an obsessed fan, too.
It started innocently, then she got into his house.
She bent his whisk and scratched his Teflon!
She made his life miserable.
She didn't quit until he hired a bodyguard.
Should I find out who?
No.
I can't believe Kari poses a real threat.
She hasn't even looked at me face-to-face.
She's had the chance.
Suit yourself.
But if you ask me, she's acting very weird.
- Tea good for your nose?
- No, I found a bag to match my shoes You're dripping all over the console.
Oh, my goodness.
- Kari.
- How did she get in your jacket?
I have no idea.
"I'm disappointed in you, Dr Crane.
"You didn't wear my scarf.
"The last man who disappointed me that way "is in his grave.
" "I'll be at the awards and I'll be looking for you.
Your No.
1 fan, Kari.
" Great!
And I'm sitting at your table with a bull's-eye on my nose.
Dr Crane, you've got to try to relax.
Yes.
What do I have to be nervous about?
If I lose this award, I'll be devastated.
If I win, my mad stalker will have a clear shot when I accept.
Don't worry.
That's why you hired the bodyguard.
I don't see why.
Even if something does happen, I was a cop for 30 years.
It's a waste of money.
They're skilled bodyguards, trained to size up a crowd, plan an escape.
- Even get shot.
- I know how to take a bullet.
That's just what your personality needs - another bullet.
That must be him.
Who is it?
Lizzie Borden.
Could you autograph my hatchet?
That's not very funny.
- Everyone ready to go?
- We're waiting for his rent-a-goon.
He's stuck in traffic.
Or your admirer got to him first and he's stuffed in a closet with a bloated tongue and garrotted neck.
Is that champagne?
You're a fountain of comfort!
I'm just teasing.
I'm a little jealous.
I told Maris about your troubles.
All she does is sulk and talk about bodyguards.
"Aren't we important enough to be stalked"?
I don't know what to say to her.
Tell her to go on being herself.
Her day will come.
That must be my muscle.
It's a woman!
Where's my bodyguard now?
It's Cindy Carruthers from the Unified Protection Agency.
Your bodyguard's named "Cindy"?
Were they all out of "Tiffanys"?
I was expecting someone big and wide.
A Dominic, a Rocco, a Ruth, even.
Hello.
I'm so glad to see you.
Thank you, Dr Crane.
But you made a fatal mistake.
Oh, my God!
It is Kari!
You should have called for a description before you let me in.
Hi, Tina.
Bring the car around.
- Tina?
- I guess Candy was busy.
First rule: "Trust no one you don't know.
" Let me write that down!
You're right.
I just feel silly when I act paranoid.
- Don't.
Paranoid is good.
- I was paranoid.
Who are these people?
My brother, Dr Niles Crane, my father, Martin, and his care specialist, Daphne Moon.
You've seen a bit of mayhem in your day, haven't you?
- Excuse me?
- I sense these things.
I'm psychic.
Wait, I'm getting a flash now.
Did your grandfather have a steel plate in his head?
This lunatic who's been calling you.
Any particular accent?
No.
- You have a security system?
- We don't need one.
We've got Eddie.
Hello, Eddie.
Don't be fooled.
Touch me and you'd get a ball-sized bite in your butt.
And Eddie would go for your ankles.
Look at the time.
Shouldn't we go?
I'll secure the elevator.
Don't open the door for anyone.
I need your blood type, where the nearest trauma centre is, and which family members would donate organs.
Just so you know, I have unusually small kidneys.
Hello.
Crane residence.
- I think it's her.
- Niles, call Cindy.
Put her on speaker.
'I know you're rushed, but I wanted to say I'll be wearing a red dress.
'But don't worry about finding me.
I'll find you.
- 'Bye!
' - Kari, wait!
Don't let it bother you so.
Come on.
Let's go.
I find it hard to imagine a woman with such a sweet voice being dangerous.
Does the name "Squeaky" Fromme mean anything to you?
There's a lot of red dresses so let's go over some rules.
Don't go anywhere alone.
Go to the men's room with a buddy.
Always keep your back to the wall.
That'll take some marksmanship.
I think I see her.
Red dress, standing by the bar.
She's staring at all the men but hiding her face.
That is my producer.
She's harmless.
She has a pimple on her nose.
Looks like a biblical plague.
Roz, over here.
Give me that.
You look beautiful.
Come join us.
- Hi.
I'm Cindy Carruthers.
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Roz.
Just stop that.
You look terrific.
You've done a great job.
It's almost disappeared.
Whoa, Roz!
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
- And who's this lovely lady?
- Cindy Carruthers.
- She has a concealed weapon.
- Makes two of us.
No kidding.
She's his bodyguard.
Wanna check out a body worth guarding?
If I move my thumb I could kill you.
I've never been so turned on.
OK, let me go.
So can I call you?
I wish she'd just make her move.
I hate thinking it could be anyone.
You know she's wearing a red dress.
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?
I'm no professional bodyguard, but if I was looking to whack a guy, maybe I'd lie about what I was wearing.
No offence to your father but stick to looking for a red dress.
Here we are, good as new.
Should we all head up to the ballroom?
Help me.
Niles, just hear me out on this.
Was it strange that Cindy dismissed Dad's theory?
She's not wearing red.
You can't think she's the She couldn't But how could?
Think about it.
She was out of the apartment when the stalker phoned.
So she was.
And we know she has a cellular phone!
But why hasn't she made her move?
Maybe she wants to get you alone.
Too many red dresses.
We'll take our own elevator.
Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Just a little chilly.
It's cold.
You should have worn a scarf.
Yes, I should have.
I meant to.
Honest.
Where's that elevator?
I asked for this assignment.
The truth is, I'm a fan of yours.
But I guess you figured that out.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
There!
There, behind the bar!
Frasier Crane?
I've waited for this moment for a long time.
I'm your No.
1 fan.
- Roz!
Find Cindy!
- Help me.
Get him off me.
It's Mrs Littlejohn, head of the nomination committee!
This is a small world.
I know your brother, Aubrey.
For God's sake, help the lady up.
I'm so sorry.
I've been stalked by this woman named Kari.
- When you said you'd been waiting - To get an autograph!
- Who's got a pen?
- Thank you, no.
Let's hope we win because we won't get nominated next year.
Have you changed your hairstyle?
What happened?
Why did you run away from me?
Paranoia has sent me crazy!
First I thought you were the stalker, then I thought she was.
I'm going to confront this!
Everyone, I will be in the lobby.
- Just calm down.
- Dad, please.
I will be in the lobby!
You're Kari, aren't you?
How did you know?
You made a scarf like that for Frasier.
He's my son.
There's been a big misunderstanding.
I'm just a fan.
I never meant to frighten him.
What about that note about that guy ending up in his grave?
That meant my husband, Walter.
He caught pneumonia.
I won't bother your son any more.
Could you tell him what happened?
Yes.
If I'm lucky, he won't understand and I'll have to explain again.
He'll understand.
That's the one thing about your son, Mr Crane.
He's so smart and level-headed.
What's she been smoking?
I'm here, you demented harpy!
Come and get me!
Kari?
Kari!
I know you're here, so come on out.
Not so brave any more, huh?
You think you're tough but you have to hide in the shadows.
Want to see who's really tough?
Just come on out.
When I said "tough", I was speaking clearly in a rhetorical sense.
Would any of you happen to have the time?
Would any of you like the time?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
That's it for today.
Goodbye and good listening.
Little off our game today, Roz.
Is something wrong?
Yes.
I told a guy I love him.
Somebody you know this time?
You hate to hear about my love life.
No, I care about you.
If you have a problem and I can help, I'd love to.
Just keep the details on a need-to-know basis.
We've dated a couple of weeks and last night he licked behind my ears - Roz, is this?
- Yes, you do need to know this.
Anyway, what I meant to say was, "I love that.
" But I yelled out, "I love you"!
He got a look on his face like Indiana Jones running from the big ball.
Do you love him?
No, but I said it, so he should've said it back.
It's just polite.
There is no more emotionally-charged phrase than "I love you".
Some people can't say it.
It makes them too vulnerable.
My father's incapable of saying it, even to me.
But I know he does.
He never told you he loves you?
God, that explains so much.
What does that mean?
You're so needy that when a friend asks your advice, you steer the conversation back to your own problems.
Anyway, I told this guy I love him.
How do I take it back?
Remember I said I cared about you and I'd like to help?
I take it back.
Get out of there!
You'll get a fish-hook up your nose.
Don't you ever clean that thing out?
No, it's bad luck.
You show up on a fishing trip with a tackle box that doesn't smell rotten and nobody will sit next to you.
My multiple personality patients did that.
They'd say the other one had sent the cheque.
What an odd combination of odours.
Smells like a fish died and all the other fish sent flowers.
Yes, it's time for Dad's annual ice fishing trip to Lake Nomahegan.
Getting ready.
Duke rented a cabin on the lake and I'm bringing the bait and pork rinds.
I don't want you boys throwing any wild parties.
How can we if you're taking all the pork rinds?
How could a fish be so dumb as to put its mouth around Ouch!
Hello?
Yes, he's right here.
It's Duke.
Hey, Duke!
I'm sorry.
Sure I understand.
We'll do it next year.
We got too many good times to let this tradition die.
Yeah.
Yeah, I love ya, ya big lug.
OK, bye.
- Your trip's been cancelled?
- Duke's back's out again.
What a shame.
You were so looking forward to it.
I still have the cabin, but I can't go alone.
As much as I'd like to do something with you, ice fishing just isn't it.
I know!
They're doing a revival of "The Iceman Cometh" downtown.
We could catch a matinee, go out for sushi and stay in the same theme.
Thanks anyway.
I used to enjoy waiting for the men to return with their catch.
My brothers' friends would come back, their chiselled faces all ruddy.
They were so masculine!
I couldn't wait to panfry their kippers.
I'll go ice fishing, Dad.
- Really?
- Unless you don't want me to.
No, this will be great!
- You?
Ice fishing?
- Why not?
I see myself as a man of the great alfresco.
You get a runny nose watching figure skating on TV.
- Thanks, Niles.
- Anything to save your trip for you.
Quite a gesture, but ice fishing?
In an Arctic tundra where large men spit and it freezes in their beards?
After you've seen Maris's dance group performing in the garden, the wilderness holds no terror.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Lovely day, isn't it?
You're in a good mood.
With your father gone, it'll be a wonderful weekend.
Care to make it perfect?
Sorry to disappoint you, but I am staying.
I found the Thermos!
Make that coffee extra strong!
How you doing?
I know you wanna go with me but it will be too cold for you.
Yeah, I love ya, ya little mutt.
I'd better make sure I have everything.
Did he just say, "I love you" to the dog?
My aunt used to say, "Good night, Mr Van der Pump" to a hat rack.
Does he say that to Eddie a lot?
I try to give them their privacy.
Sorry, I'm just curious.
I don't want to sound maudlin, but I can't remember Dad ever saying that to me.
You know he's a crusty old git.
Yes, but he says it to Eddie and he said it to Duke on the phone.
Duke and your father go way back.
He's his chum.
And I'm not?
When your dad wants to go fishing, at least you could go with him.
You're suggesting that I pretend that I'm enjoying myself just to hear the words "I love you"?
Women have been doing it for centuries.
Call me Ishmael.
Look at you!
Are you sure you're gonna be warm enough?
I dressed in layers.
Polo, Eddie Bauer and Timberland.
You look like a skinny Elmer Fudd.
Wait till you see the stuff I got!
I had no idea I liked fishing till I realised all the shopping involved.
Graphite poles and Hot Buns.
You microwave them and they stay toasty warm for hours.
Dad, maybe I was a little hasty Here we are.
Some snacks for the trip.
Look at you in your new togs!
The fish will see him coming.
The salesmen certainly did.
Dad, I feel bad that I turned you down.
- Don't worry about it.
- Taste this smoked turkey jerky.
Why don't you just ask him?
How can I?
I said I didn't want to go.
- Delicious!
- Don't - Come on, it's getting late.
- Let's hit the road.
Are you sure you're up to the drive?
I'm getting some mixed signals.
Do you want to go with us?
All right!
Better than hearing you nag all the time!
Fine!
I'll go!
Well, this is The ice isn't gonna break.
This lake has been frozen for three months.
I'm sorry, Dad.
When you said a cabin on the lake, this is not what I had in mind.
It's a cabin, it's on the lake.
If it gets warmer, it'll be in the lake.
That was amazing!
I've never felt so in touch with nature!
For the first time in my life, I just urinated outdoors!
Another cup of coffee, I'll go back and dot the "i".
Dad, this is great!
- Frasier doesn't think so.
- I'm not complaining.
It's just that I thought it would be something more lake-adjacent.
We're actually going to sleep in here?
Who is this rube?
Maybe we can trick him into touching his tongue to the bait bucket!
No, we're sleeping someplace else.
Just off the highway is the Bed and Bass Motel.
Bed and Bass.
One of the finer fish-themed hotels.
So what do we do?
We make a hole in the ice with this thing and start fishing?
It's called an auger.
Well, imagine my embarrassment.
- Here's your Hot Buns, Dad.
- Thanks.
- What am I gonna sit on?
- The auger's free.
All right, come on.
Here.
I saw that.
I am simply wondering how long we've been sitting here enjoying ourselves.
If the fish aren't peckish, we'll pass the time in good conversation.
This lake was formed by the retreat of glaciers in the Cenozoic era.
Which was the last time anyone caught a fish in it.
How do you know that, Niles?
I read it in "Fielding's Geological History of Western Canada".
This very lake is 89 metres deep and boasts 50 varieties of fish!
Oh, Alex, I'll take bodies of water for 500.
It has lake trout, rainbow trout, walleyed pike How would you like to sleep with them?
You could learn a thing or two about getting into the spirit of things.
I'm hungry and tired of trying to warm up one bun at a time in 20-degree weather!
That's negative six degrees Celsius, a system named after the Swedish astronomer and compulsive temperature taker!
Niles, switch!
- You're on my side.
- I am not.
- You've crossed the border.
- I don't know why I'm here!
Why don't you just head back to the Bed and Bass?
Just what I need - a five-mile hike in freezing weather!
- Take the car and pick us up later.
- Fine.
- There's a hole in my pocket!
- You lost the keys?
- Where?
- If I knew, they wouldn't be lost!
- Between here and the car.
- And it's been snowing all day.
Great.
We'll have to stay here all night!
By morning, we'll be frozen entrees for wolves!
Wait!
Is that them over there?
- Thank God!
- Give me those right now.
Fine, Mr Big Brother.
- Nice catch.
- Me?
You throw like a girl!
Don't panic.
We'll be fine here.
This happened to me and Duke.
- You dropped your car keys?
- We're not idiots.
The battery died.
The three of us were just fine.
- You, Duke and who?
- My drinking buddy, Mr James Beam.
I got some fishing supplies, too.
I never thought I'd end up yearning for the Bed and Bass.
- Niles?
- Yes, please.
My God, what was that?
Just the ice cracking underneath us.
Relax.
It happens all the time.
If we do fall in, we'll have 90 seconds until hypothermia sets in.
One more fact, you're going in that hole!
- The walleyed pike - That's enough!
Will you guys stop going after each other?
We're gonna lighten things up.
We're drinking.
We need a drinking song.
There is a great drinking song from "La Traviata".
"Libiamo Brindisi".
- That's from "Rigoletto".
- It's from "La Traviata".
That was great!
- What's the second verse?
- I don't know.
It's in Italian!
- Another drink?
- No, I'll pass on that.
I gotta go use the facilities.
But I'll be right back.
So keep a light on in the window for me.
I'm still thirsty, Niles.
Beam me up!
Can I ask you a personal question?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What?
This Sergeant-Niles-of-the-Yukon act.
- It can't be all to impress Daphne.
- It's not an act.
I've never heard you comment on fish, except to say that the sauce had separated.
All right, I'll tell you.
You promise not to laugh?
You'll have to take that hat off.
When you took Dad in I thought I was getting away with something.
But watching you two get closer, I thought maybe I was missing out.
You want him?
No, let me finish.
I just feel the need to make a connection.
You've made a connection.
It just seems a bit extreme.
You could've just taken him to Captain Andy's Surf and Turf.
And miss out on the fun of memorising useless fish facts and buying a battery-operated wardrobe?
So you're having just as bad a time as I am?
Worse.
You have the fun of complaining.
I have to feign enthusiasm.
I really am king of the ninnies, aren't I?
Don't be reaching for that sceptre yet.
Wanna know the reason I came up here?
Just to hear him say the words "I love you".
What?
He said it to Duke, he said it to Eddie.
He's never said to me.
Surely you don't put yourself up there with Eddie.
You know he loves you.
Of course.
I am being ridiculous.
Look at the guy.
He's content to sit here freezing his buns off because we're here with him.
I just got a little obsessed about hearing it.
You know that Maris loves you, but it's still nice to hear it.
I imagine it would be, but let's stick to attainable goals.
As they laughed the laugh of the damned.
I did it!
I wrote my name!
I had to borrow an "n" from Niles, but I did it!
You're leaving quite a urological crossword puzzle.
So what were you guys laughing at?
- Oh, nothing.
- Don't leave your old man out.
All right.
I was explaining to Niles the reason I drove all this way up here was I was hoping to hear you say, "I love you.
" I leave you for two minutes, and you have to start thinking!
Isn't it enough that we're having a good time?
Dad Thousands of guys go fishing and love never enters into it.
- Can we just go on fishing?
- Sure.
A fisherman in Wisconsin stared into a hole for 20 years before he caught his first fish.
Haven't we been here that long?
Just because I didn't say it, doesn't mean I don't feel it.
That's exactly what we were saying.
My dad never said it, but I know he felt it.
Feeling it is the same as saying it.
- You don't have to say it.
- Did it ever occur to you that maybe I wanna say it?
Your mother used to get all over me about not saying stuff, too.
I can't say it if you're looking at me.
Would it help you if we left?
Just for that I'm doing you second.
I don't know why it's so hard.
You can say it.
You said it to Duke.
That's different.
I said, "I love ya.
" Ya!
We'd take "ya"!
Yeah.
If I'm gonna do it, I'll do it right.
Frasier Frasier I love you.
Niles I love you.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you, too.
And I love you, too.
But I hate ice fishing!
It's the last time you'll have to do that.
In that case, I really love you.
- Thanks.
- Look, that's so cute!
When you say it to him, he blushes.
I love you.
- Cut it out!
- I love you.
- Now, come on!
Stop it!
- Give us a kiss.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Officer!
- You have to come off the ice.
- We've lost the car keys.
I'll take you to a motel and you can call a locksmith.
- Wonderful idea.
- Thank you.
We love you.
Ya.
We love ya.
We've been drinking a little.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
You're on KACL with Dr Frasier Crane.
We have time for one more call.
Hello, Gretchen.
I'm listening.
'Well, you see, Dr Crane, my husband is a fencing instructor 'and lately he spends all his time with his wealthy new student 'and I'm afraid there's some bumsen going on.
' - Do you have any evidence?
- 'No, it's just a feeling.
' Well, in these matters, there's no simple way to know for sure.
Yes, there is.
Well, Gretchen, you're in luck.
It just so happens we have in our studio today one of the world's five leading bumsen experts.
If you want to know if a man is cheating, you offer him two choices for dinner, one that's fattening and one that's light.
If he picks the calorie packed one, he doesn't mind turning into a pig, which means he's happily married.
Hearing advice like that, I wish there was a law against women gathering at a water cooler.
- Now, Gretchen - 'Does it really work, Roz?
' - Oh, trust me.
- 'I'm going to do it.
'Thank you for your help, Roz.
- 'Oh, and you too, Dr Crane.
' - Don't mention it.
Well, Dr Crane and friends will be back tomorrow.
Thanks for listening, Seattle.
- I know you hate it when I butt in.
- And yet You'll forgive me when you find out what I'm doing for you.
There's this woman who lives in my building.
- She's beautiful and funny.
- Stop.
I do not go out on blind dates.
They're demeaning and a waste of time.
- No, thank you.
No.
- It's for your father.
What time should he pick her up?
Wait a minute.
They are OK for your father, but not for you?
Yes.
And games with balls, beer and giant trucks that roll over small ones.
"So you want to build a three-masted schooner.
"Before assembly, take inventory of all parts.
" - We don't need to read that.
- We do.
It says here, in bold, "Read all instructions".
Pass me the right side of the hull.
You'll get that piece at Step 16 and not a moment sooner.
- Can we get started here?
- All right, Dad.
"So you want to build a three-masted schooner.
" Give me that!
You'll put your eye out.
Look at that!
What a beautiful ship!
- I bet you'll have fun building that.
- Not as much fun as reading about it.
Did I ever mention one of my ancestors was a mutineer on HMS Bounty.
No kidding.
He made it safely to Pitcairn Island where he was fruitful and multiplied.
For all I know, there's some girl who looks exactly like me in the South Seas, frolicking in the surf, brown-skinned and bare breasted.
So you want to build a two-masted schooner?
Schooner?
I thought it was a frigate.
A frigate has a fore-and-aft mainsail.
- That's a brigantine.
- Well, what's a frigate?
That's when you just don't give a damn.
- Hello.
- Hello there.
Are you spending the evening with us?
Yes.
Maris misses me, but feels family comes first.
She saw this model and felt I should share it with Dad.
- She wanted you out of the house?
- Like a musty smell.
Dad, I have a proposal for you.
There's a woman in Roz's building that would like to go out with you.
Roz says she's got a wonderful personality.
Oh, I guess that means I'm the pretty one.
- Tell Roz thanks but no thanks.
- You're making a mistake.
Trying new things is what keeps us all young and vibrant.
You're right.
For weeks Maris floated in a sensory deprivation tank, but she's taken up fencing and I've never seen her more vital.
She stays up late into the evening, working with her instructor.
- Maris has a fencing instructor?
- Yes.
Gunnar was the Bavarian champion three years running.
He's Bavarian?
You're full of questions I've already answered.
Am I?
He speaks no English.
Maris practises German while she parries and thrusts.
Maris is learning German, huh?
Just when you thought she couldn't get any cuddlier.
- Dad, did you take the spanking aft?
- Yeah, I pre-glued it for you.
- Good job!
- Not to worry.
This used to happen to my brothers all the time.
I can get it off with nail polish remover.
Come with me.
- So your brothers built models?
- No, I suspect they just sniffed glue.
- That can cause brain damage.
- Well, then, that confirms it.
Dad.
Dad.
I have to talk to you about Niles.
I got a call from a German woman whose husband is a fencing instructor that she suspects is having an affair with his wealthy new client.
- And?
- Don't you find it incriminating?
It's a coincidence.
Seattle's a big city.
I'm sure German fencing instructors have dozens of students.
But are they wealthy?
No.
They're working their way out of the ghetto with a foil and a dream In the midst of that slag heap of sarcasm, there may be a kernel of truth.
I could be letting my imagination run away with me.
Forget it.
Help me put this model together.
Oh, my God.
I remember how Niles used to love these models.
Remember that Christmas Mum got him "The Visible Man And Woman"?
- He had to glue the internal organs.
- I remember you two fighting.
He got on my nerves, so I stole his ovaries.
There's a conversation I'm glad I missed the beginning of.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Did you ask your dad about the date?
- He's not interested.
- Darn it.
I got her hopes up.
Would you consider going out with her?
Sorry.
I've had my quota of pity dates.
But this time you wouldn't be the one being pitied.
We have a great call to start the show off with.
The guy on line three found out his girlfriend is his sister!
Wow!
- That German woman called back.
- Gretchen?
- Yeah.
- I want her first.
What do I say to the guy dating his sister?
Tell him to hang on.
We've all been there.
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.
Roz?
Gretchen's calling about her husband's affair.
She thinks she has more evidence.
- I'm listening.
- 'I took Roz's advice.
'I gave my husband two choices for dinner 'and he picked the diet plate!
' That is no proof he's having an affair.
- 'But Gunnar has a healthy appetite.
' - No, no, no.
The proof is phone bills, credit card receipts Gunnar?
I also found a love letter.
How long were you going to keep that secret?
What does it say?
- I'm sorry.
I don't speak German.
- 'It's means my little liver dumpling.
- 'That used to be his pet name for me.
' - Maybe he's writing to you.
'It can't be me.
He says he loves her beautiful, little body, 'as thin as his sword and her skin as white as bratwurst, 'and that she's his nicht eine menschliche Frau.
' - What is that?
- 'I don't know if there's an English word.
'The closest translation is "not quite human woman".
' - Dear God.
It is her.
- 'What should I do?
' I don't know.
I need time to think.
Let's go to commercial.
Hello.
Gretchen, I have considered your problem.
You must confront your husband and insist that he end this affair.
- 'What if he won't?
' - But innocent people are being hurt.
Tell him how much he means to you.
Are there children?
- 'No.
' - Damn!
Still, it must be a clean break.
He must never see this woman again.
'We never had these problems back home.
' Maybe you should return to the loving bosom of Bavaria.
'How did you know we were from Bavaria?
' Well, I'm a master of dialect.
I noticed there was a glottal quality to the occlusion of your diphthongs.
'I'm originally from Austria.
' Do you want to split hairs or get your husband back?
It's time for another commercial.
- Another commercial?
- Yes, another commercial!
What is going on?
Why do you think something's going on?
When the person giving advice sounds crazier than the caller, I think something's going on.
Nothing's going on.
You know who the liver dumpling is, don't you?
Yes.
But it's nobody you know.
Her husband's a friend of mine.
- How can I tell him?
- Don't tell the person being cheated on.
Confront the person who's cheating.
Didn't Harvard teach you anything?
I can't do that.
You tell her you know she's been mattress surfing and if she won't stop, you'll tell.
It's not that easy.
You don't know her.
She can't deal with confrontation.
I once questioned her for serving veal and we found her in the garage with the engine running on a golf cart.
Whoa, it's Maris!
Mrs Crane is in the box?
Maris!
This is Frasier.
I'm tired of waiting for you to come out of this ridiculous tank.
We've got to talk about Niles.
Will you come out of there?
Look, Maris I know you're having an affair.
I care for you both and I want to help you do what's best for your marriage.
Will you stop this?
Just come Come out of this box!
All right, I'm going to open the door.
I'm going to count to three.
I don't care if you're naked.
I'm going to count to ten.
To hell with this!
All right!
Niles, I'm so sorry.
Marta, you said Mrs Crane was in the box?
- Si, Missy Crane.
- That's Mr Crane!
Marta has trouble with her pronouns.
- I'm worried.
He's sensitive.
- You're right.
Maybe we shouldn't let on how worried we are.
It will add to his anxiety.
If we coddle him, he'll think the world's ended.
- Hello, Niles.
- Hi, Son.
It's OK.
It's OK, Niles.
Come on.
It's all right.
- We're all here for you, son.
- My little brother.
Frasier, pour him a glass of brandy.
Yes.
Oh, God.
I'm all out of brandy.
I have a marvellous sherry, some fine ports and a lovely bottle of 12-year-old unblended Scotch.
- It's a bit peaty - Just pour him a drink!
- What happened, son?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
When I left, you were about to storm up to her room and have it out with her?
I thought of questions to fire at her, but when I reached her door I froze.
I turned and walked out of the house, got in the car and started driving.
I'm glad you ended up here.
Actually, I ended up at the Oregon border check.
I had fruit in the car, so I had to turn back.
What will I do?
She's my whole life.
She may have temporarily succumbed to Gunnar's Teutonic charms, but in the end I'm sure she'll choose the man who's intelligent and sensitive.
Frasier, that's just something we used to tell ourselves in chess club.
The truth is women don't want men of intellect.
They want men of action, like Gunnar.
It has nothing to do with Gunnar.
It's about you and Maris.
Remember your advice when I had problems with Lilith?
You said I should talk to her and find out why she did what she did.
It's one thing to give advice, another to take it.
Frase, didn't you and Lilith write articles on the keys to a successful marriage?
- Yes.
- It might help Niles to read them.
Well, all right.
I've only got half.
Lilith got the rest in the divorce settlement.
Now that we got rid of the foghorn, here's the way to handle it.
Remember this happened between your mother and I?
- Right.
- Well, I took it up with the other man.
I told him if it ever happened again, he'd be the other woman.
There was a lot more that we had to do to keep our marriage together, but at least she knew how much I cared.
Should I grab Gunnar by the scruff of the neck and throw him out?
- Why not?
- I've been fantasising about it.
It's just not me, though.
Although maybe it should be me.
No, I've got to speak to Maris eventually.
Although, if I do it your way, I'm going at it from a position of strength.
I'll do it, Dad.
Tonight it's Gunnar who will be taught a lesson.
- That's my boy.
Sure you're up to it?
- Yes, I am.
I'm pumped, I'm psyched and I just swallowed an entire twist of lemon.
- Did I just hear Niles leave?
- He went to straighten out Gunnar.
God, Dad, how could you let him go?
What if Gunnar wants to fight?
It's still better this way.
He's found his manhood.
I'll be happy if he traded in some teeth for his cojones.
I've got to stop walking in on the middle of conversations.
There you are.
Yes, I'm talking to you, strudel boy!
No one gets away with seducing my wife.
You probably thought, because of my swimmer's build, I wouldn't fight for her, but you're wrong, because real men have a thing called honour.
Yow!
You wouldn't know about that.
- Niles.
- You don't know how to behave.
You don't know the meaning of rectitude.
He doesn't know the meaning of dog.
He doesn't speak English!
Marta?
You speak German?
She worked for a German family that turned up in Guatemala just after the war.
Good.
She can translate.
Tell her to tell him Niles, just wait!
If he knew you were calling him strudel boy, he'd wipe his feet on your face.
If there are scuffs, they'll be scuffs of honour.
How dare you steal my wife!
Translate.
All right.
All right, fine, you want to challenge me?
En garde!
That's just what we need, a fourth language!
You can't possibly fight this man.
You forget.
I've been fencing since prep school.
So what?
He was born with a sword in his hand.
He probably performed his own Caesarean.
My God.
He's going to kill me.
Oh, very nice, very nice.
Thank you.
Niles!
Are you all right?
Is he giving up?
He wants you to apologise.
He didn't steal your shoes.
- My shoes?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
Apparently, I mistranslated.
He didn't mean Not shoes, wife.
Frau?
He couldn't help it.
Maris is irresistible Irresistible?
!
OK.
- But she refused him.
- Really?
What did Maris say?
"I love Niles.
" Oh, she loves me.
My Maris is home.
In five seconds, tell him he's fired.
Maris!
If only I could help Gunnar and Gretchen.
Tell him his wife loves him very much.
No, no, not me, you!
You!
Marta, damn your pronoun problems!
All right, you hapless wretch!
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Oh, my!
# And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged!
# But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Frasier has left the building.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.
Double latte, full fat, chocolate shavings.
- The self-pity special.
- I've had a hellish week.
To top it off, our wine club president kicked the bucket.
His body wasn't even chilled before the club jackals angled to succeed him.
You've never seen such conniving.
- Who's winning?
- Maris, of course, but just barely.
Matthew Pym tried to stage a coup.
Fortunately, Maris has photos she took at his wedding, showing the label on the champagne.
- Domestic?
- Not just domestic.
From Connecticut.
It's that dreadful woman who works for you.
- Who?
- Lady Macbeth without the sincerity.
Oh, Bebe's here.
I care for her just as little as you do, but she is a terrific agent, which is why I overlook the fact that she's pushy, obnoxious and a phoney.
- Bebe, darling, how are you?
- My poor, wounded baby.
I heard what those misers you work for are trying to do.
- They're not going to get away with it.
- You heard wrong.
They extended my contract with an 8% raise.
Double cappuccino.
Move it!
Well, Bebe, that is what my contract calls for.
A slave contract you negotiated before you had an agent.
- They took advantage of you.
- I thought it was generous.
Do you have any idea how hot you are?
I get offers every day offering the moon for you.
- Am I really that hot?
- Are you kidding?
If I were a pot roast, I'd be done.
I'm Niles, a person at the table.
Niles, thank God you're here.
Give him some brotherly advice.
She's the devil.
Run fast, run far.
Bebe, I realise the station makes a handsome profit on my show, but what can I do?
- I do have a contract.
- No, darling, what you have is a fever.
- What?
- Ooh!
You're like a furnace!
I think I see where you're going with this and I'm not sure how I feel about it.
- How do you feel about being low paid?
- Who makes more?
Who doesn't?
Nanette from "Pet Chat", the Happy Chef.
- Father Mike could buy and sell you.
- Father Mike!
- He took a vow of poverty.
- Well, now he's taking a cruise.
Oh, that big, strapping chest of yours is all congested.
Say the word and I'll tell the station you have some coughing up to do and so do they.
Bebe, this fever of mine, how much higher do you think it might go?
I'm guessing 30% to 40% above where it is now.
Well, what else can I say, but ah-choo.
'You wanted me to get you pregnant.
' 'I was in a coma.
' My God, in one scene they've got Sky, Zena and Slate.
I don't think someone called Frasier should point any fingers.
Is this how you spend your days when I'm not at home?
When you're not home, I can hear what they're saying.
You wouldn't want to miss this.
"Oh, Zirconia, can't you see Stone doesn't love you?
He loves Placenta.
" My favourite are the villains.
One guy kicked his grandmother down the stairs, embezzled money from a hospital and poisoned a puppy.
Give him credit, though.
He did show up for work every day.
If you're going to be so subtle, how will I ever get your point?
I think when you sign a contract, you stick to it.
A man's only as good as his word.
My words have doubled ad revenues and they gave me a measly 8% raise.
So what?
In 30 years on the police force, do you think I ever said, "Hey, I'm shooting more bad guys, how about a bonus"?
You don't understand.
It's show business.
- I'll get it.
- Thank you, Daphne.
Negotiations are like a dance.
They expect me to fight my contract.
They know I'm not sick.
I know they know.
They know I know they know.
- It's all part of the negotiations mambo.
- Hello, Roz.
- Daphne.
Hey, Martin.
- How are things at the front?
They painted over your parking space name.
Perfect.
Bebe told me they might.
It's a negotiating tactic.
It shows they're nervous.
They must be jittery.
They took your picture down.
- Roz, they're just trying to scare me.
- He knows they're trying to scare him.
They know that he knows they're trying to scare him.
Thank you, Dad!
- It's like a card game.
- Like a card game.
It's like a dance.
It sounds like a weekend in Vegas.
I thought they'd play games, too, but they're auditioning replacements.
- They're interviewing people?
- All day.
They're hot on this woman who has a gardening show.
She calls herself Ma Nature.
I can't work for her, Frasier.
You should see her nails.
There's no need to panic.
I'm sure it's all part of the dance.
The station sent me over with your stuff.
They've cleaned out my cubicle?
You're up on the gossip.
They're bluffing, right?
I hope not.
My audition went really well.
Nurse Bebe reporting for duty.
Blossoms for my little shut-in.
Put these in something.
Have you heard what's going on?
They're auditioning other people.
Marvellous!
They're resorting to cheap scare tactics.
Looks like I was right to bring this along.
Chill that.
Darling, you're looking pale.
Don't tell me these amateur theatrics are worrying you?
Well, no, no, but the stress of not worrying is starting to get to me.
I don't know if I can take much more of this.
Darling, if that's the way you feel, then fine.
Let's get this over with.
Frasier, it's for the best.
Trust me on this one.
Tom Duran, please.
Bebe Glaser calling.
Tom, Bebe's bored.
You huffed and puffed, but our house is still standing.
We'll give you a midnight deadline.
Either call us at Frasier's and we'll renegotiate or we'll walk!
Love you.
That should make them sweat.
Don't you think?
It might.
It's all over, but the waiting.
Canasta, anyone?
Shuffle these.
Oh, God.
It's over.
They've made the decision.
It's over.
It was a fun run while it lasted, eh, Seattle?
This is Dr Frasier Crane!
And I was listening!
Here we are.
One tea, half-Darjeeling, half-camomile.
Skimmed milk and sweetener.
I thought you'd enjoy a fat free tea biscuit.
Will there be anything else?
- No.
You run along.
I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
I could wait until you finish the biscuit and floss your teeth for you.
You are a cheeky little monkey, aren't you?
This cookie tastes like meat!
Yes and it'll remove tartar and give you a nice, shiny coat.
I think I'm going to hit the hay, too.
That's risky, isn't it?
Leaving us kids out here unchaperoned.
Better him than me.
Why are you so tense?
This is the best part.
What could be more fun than this?
Watching a loved one be autopsied?
Think of them, sweating in their offices, chain-smoking, biting their nails, their ulcers churning out enough acid to burn a hole in a ship's hull.
Oh, God!
And to think I nearly went into nursing.
You're right, Bebe.
You're right.
If they're foolish enough to let me go, other stations would love to have Frasier Crane.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
But it's time to discuss other offers and consider our fallback position.
Ooh!
Someone's out of Scotch.
Bebe, tell me there are other offers.
Scads!
Look me in the eye and tell me the truth.
There are no other offers.
Straight up or on the rocks?
My God!
Darling, you can't make a deal without bluffing.
You're supposed to bluff them, not me!
- Are you trying to ruin me?
- You are such a worrywart.
Don't you patronise me, you sweet-talking succubus.
Call them.
Ooh, my God.
Hands of Hercules.
What must your legs be like?
- Answer it.
- Not yet.
Where are we?
Have we gone out?
Is it too late?
Answer it!
Crane residence.
Bebe Glaser speaking.
It's them.
I see.
I see.
Fine.
Well?
Renegotiations tomorrow, from scratch.
Dear God!
Oh.
Oh, we did it.
Oh, my God, I'm so pleased.
Thank you, Bebe.
Maybe next time you'll trust little Bebe.
I'm sorry.
I underestimated you.
I'm sorry for that outburst and for grabbing you.
Don't be.
I was impressed.
It was manly in a hysterical sort of way.
Cheers.
Champagne on top of Scotch.
- What the hell!
- To a beautiful partnership.
No.
To a remarkable agent.
What Bebe wants, Bebe gets.
When will I ever learn that?
Soon enough, dear.
Soon enough.
Sorry, Eddie, he's still alive.
You're not getting your own room.
- How're you feeling?
- How do I look?
The last time I saw a guy who looked like you he'd been in the trunk of a car for a month.
Good morning!
My goodness, christened a few ships last night, I see.
The station agreed to renegotiate.
- Oh, well done.
- They called around five to midnight.
Bebe and I had some champagne to celebrate and then And then Oh, God.
Morning, Doctor.
Somebody hold me.
I didn't see a robe and your shirt is so nice and big and warm just like you.
I think I'll go in the other room and eat my breakfast, while I still can.
I'd better go cook for him.
I know how the Crane men like their legs eggs.
I think they were a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised myself.
Let's not kid ourselves.
We both knew this would happen someday.
- We did?
- The signs were all there.
The glances, the furtive smiles.
You know what would really hit the spot right now?
My God, you're a machine!
I meant coffee.
- I'll get it.
- That's not necessary.
Good morning, Niles.
What a lovely surprise.
We were about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?
Come on in, Niles.
It's all right.
We were celebrating.
The station called to renegotiate my contract.
Paid your commission upfront, I see.
It's getting late.
I'll freshen up.
Save me a muffin, muffin.
Oh, all right.
Go ahead.
Get your shots in.
I'm just glad you're all right.
I'd assumed she killed after mating.
- Is she gone?
- No, Dad.
She's changing.
Oh, my God.
How did this happen?
You're asking us?
I've got to tell her this was just a mistake.
You'd better be careful.
She's liable to go nuts, like in that movie, then try to boil Eddie.
- We'll give you privacy.
- I can't tell her now.
She's renegotiating my contract.
- I'll tell her later.
- What a good idea.
Wait till she makes you money, then you can make her feel really used.
Sounds like a plan to me.
- Darling!
- We'll leave you to your happy task.
Cancel that muffin, Bebe just started a diet.
Wink.
Besides, tonight we're dining at Bernardi's.
It's sinfully expensive, but after contract talks, we can afford it.
- Bebe.
- Yes.
Bebe, I don't think there are any words to describe what we shared last night.
It was like Greco-Roman wrestling on a trampoline.
As magical as it was, it's not the kind of thing we should let happen again.
I value you too much as a colleague to jeopardise that relationship.
- I see.
- Oh, you're upset.
We'd both have realised sooner or later.
I was hoping for later, but sooner's best.
I'd better dash.
I'll call you later.
Oh, like you never crawled under the wrong fence once in your life!
Disaster.
Maris's wine club had an outing to the local vineyard.
As president, she was first into the vat.
Imagine her humiliation as she danced in a barefoot fury and was unable to break a single grape.
Have you heard a word I've said?
Of course not.
I'm still worried about Bebe.
- You said she took it well.
- You know how strong women are.
Sometimes strength masks vulnerability.
Well, let's face it, once a woman has dipped her toe into Crane Lake dry land is never the same again.
She's probably writing Mrs Bebe Crane over and over in the margin of her algebra book.
You can make light of this if you want, but I may have broken her heart.
- Whose heart did you break?
- No one!
Niles, be quiet!
I'm going to figure it out sooner or later.
Give me a clue.
Just one.
Doc!
Bebe's on the ledge!
She's threatening to jump!
- Oh, my God.
This is all my fault!
- Wait!
Just give me a hint!
- Bebe, please!
- Get away from me!
Excuse me.
What happened?
I don't know.
We were working out your deal and she burst into tears.
I went to get her water.
When I came back, she's out there, sobbing she doesn't want to live.
Bebe, it's Frasier.
Please come in.
It's no good!
My life is over!
You gotta save her.
My contract's up in six weeks.
She's my agent, too.
- I'm going out there.
- Are you nuts?
You know what the drop would do to you?
Toss a pumpkin out, so I have a clear image.
- Why don't you wait for the police?
- No.
No.
That woman out there needs me.
- Bebe, I'm coming out.
- Don't come any closer.
I'll jump!
- Bebe, please.
- You can't help me!
No one can help me!
I'm not worth doing this over.
Look, there'll be other men.
It may take time, but you'll get over me.
Somebody thinks well of himself.
What?
This isn't about us.
It's just a little bargaining tactic.
I threaten to jump.
You talk me down.
Major coverage.
Bang!
Your price goes up 20%.
My life is meaningless!
Talk to me, darling.
Talk to me.
- You're coming in right now.
- Stay away from me!
You can't talk me out of this!
At least not until Channel Five gets here.
Come on, dear.
Make like a therapist.
You're out of your mind.
You should be in therapy.
That's good, but louder.
Give me one reason to live!
Just one!
Well, there are hundreds of reasons.
Work, art, the people who care about you.
Now, come in, you crazy bitch!
Channel Five, come to Mama!
Here's the plan.
I swoon forward, you catch me.
- What?
- On three.
One, two - No!
- three!
Film at 11:00.
Just get in.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine now.
Get her some water.
Do you want to sit down?
Thank you, Frasier.
You saved my life.
That was incredible, Frasier.
Look, I know we've got some unfinished business, but after this, there's no way we're going to let you get away.
Well, thank you, Tom.
If I could just have a moment alone with Bebe?
Sure.
What kind of a woman are you?
You seduced me, lied to me.
nearly got me killed.
You've shamelessly manipulated me, the station, the media and the city of Seattle.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Aren't you glad I'm on your side?
Yes, I suppose I am.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
And so in the opinion of this critic, Mickey's Good Time Tavern is anything but dismal decor, perfunctory service and cuisine only marginally preferable to hunger.
And finally, on a sadder note, after 53 years, Orsini's is closing its doors.
Tonight, a sad adieu to the grande dame of Seattle restaurants.
I thought he was the grande dame of Seattle restaurants.
Till next time, this is Gil Chesterton saying "Bon appetit, buon appetito and nifty noshing.
" - Gil, why is Orsini's closing?
- The owner wants to sell.
And Orsini's is like wine that's stayed too long in the cellar - only memories of its former glory.
- Not comping your cheque?
- Not for months now.
Orsini's was my favourite restaurant.
Have you ever been there, Roz?
My typical date's idea of a gourmet evening is take out, make out and home by Letterman.
- Knock, knock.
- Show starts in two minutes.
Look at the John Steinbeck I bought at the rare book fair.
"St Katy The Virgin", in like-new condition.
She'd have to be, wouldn't she?
It's a shame more people haven't read it.
- Let's see.
- Don't!
You'll decrease its value.
Oh Niles guess what, a thriving nightspot is closing its doors.
Roz, you're moving.
No Niles, Orsini's is closing.
It can't be!
It's part of Crane history!
Grandfather took me there for my eighth birthday.
- Thanks, Roz.
- Such vivid memories.
Paper hats, singing Happy Birthday, sending back the veal Prince Orloff.
Let's go to Orsini's for a glorious farewell dinner.
I'll make reservations.
We'll take Dad and Daphne.
She had a bad experience there, one Christmas Eve an Italian soccer team was there.
Maris announced she was in the mood for a goose and tragedy ensued.
Dear God.
What has happened to this place?
It's like running into a movie star you once worshipped, only time has left her hair brittle, her eyes sunken and dull, her skin waxy and sallow.
I've got an appetite.
How about you, Daph?
Yes, sir.
Do you have a reservation?
Yes.
The name's Crane.
For four.
Table nine seems to be free.
Right this way, sir.
- Your waiter will be here in a moment.
- Thank you.
Here, Daphne.
- Thank you.
- Dad, Frasier, isn't that Otto?
My God, I believe it is!
Otto is legendary here.
He never writes anything down.
He keeps it all in his head.
Otto!
Coming up.
Your cheque, sir.
Wrong table.
We'd like menus, please.
Sorry.
I hate it when we get crowded.
I'm going to the john.
Order me a beer.
I thought you might surprise me and order a glass of wine.
I thought you might surprise me and button your yap.
I'd order him the crab cocktail but the irony would be lost on him.
They'll have trouble finding a buyer for this place.
Yes.
One old relic whose time has come to be put out of his misery.
Oh, no, Otto, I didn't mean you.
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.
- Lovely.
- Thank you.
- He's in the men's room.
- No, Otto!
Leave it here.
Why do Americans always rush to tear things down?
At home, we treasure antiquities.
You just bring in bulldozers.
- I agree with Daphne.
- I'll try to contain my amazement.
It's a crime to lose a landmark like this.
I mean look at it.
It's well-built, good structure.
It does have good bones.
It's in a very good location.
- If they only had valet parking.
- If they took down those awful curtains.
Knocked out these pillars.
You know I've always dreamed of owning a four-star restaurant.
What growing boy hasn't?
- We'd need a new chef.
- The chef at Emilio's is unhappy.
Yes!
The man's scungili is a cry for help.
Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I'm picking out china and sandblasting the wine cave.
It can be hard work - if you don't scald yourself or lop off a finger, you're gagging at grease fires, killing rats and brawling with labour racketeers.
Me auntie had a little tearoom.
You're not gonna do a dumb-ass thing like buying this place?
With all respect, we're not neophytes in this field.
- We know food and wine.
- We have style, taste and refinement.
But you guys never think about the hard work or the long hours.
To you, owing a restaurant is fancy clothes, hobnobbing with friends and turning enemies away.
I hadn't even thought about that!
Look, when I was a cop, there was this one restaurant in the corner.
In 10 years, it changed hands 20 times.
It was Ling Fung's Lychee Palace, then Tony's Meatball Hutch, then, A Taste Of Yorkshire - English food.
Big surprise - that lasted about five minutes.
Frasier, Dad has a point.
A lot of people have lost a lot of money in this business for one reason.
They pick the wrong name!
Sure Niles, but I've got something very special.
I was thinking about it while Dad was talking.
Maison Crane.
You're right, it's too obvious.
We want our name to be inviting.
What's the word for "light-hearted" in French?
There isn't one.
I've got it, Niles!
Les Frères Heureux.
The Happy Brothers!
Brilliant!
Homey and just hard enough to pronounce to intimidate riffraff.
We'll make it very exclusive.
No sign, no advertising, and an unlisted phone number.
And you could post guards on the roof to shoot people as they try to get in!
- I believe.
Do you believe?
- I believe.
- What would you like?
- The whole damned place!
And for the lady?
We're a hit.
A palpable hit.
We're full, except for that table in that dank corner next to the men's room.
That is not a dank corner.
That is the enchanted grotto.
I've been getting nothing but compliments.
Chef Maurice has outdone himself.
The menu cannot be improved upon.
Unless it would be to add a soupçon of brandy to the Cherries Jubilee.
I want those cherries to be jubilant.
Daphne, Dad, everything OK?
Oh, yes.
Whatever this anguilla is, it's smashing.
Our chef can do things with eels you wouldn't believe.
I arrested a guy for that once.
You really pulled it off, Dr Crane.
Sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but it seems the restaurant is a success.
By tomorrow, it'll be the toast of Seattle.
- What's in there?
- Anguilla.
Dear God!
Maurice likes to kill them to order, then serve them with the heads on.
Thank God his speciality isn't roast beef.
- Are those soufflés for table nine?
- I'm about to bake them.
I shouldn't second-guess presentation, but would you be averse to trying something radical?
What?
Instead of individual soufflés, bake a large soufflé and serve it at the table.
When people hear "Niles Crane", I want them to think "big soufflé".
As you wish.
- There's a party without a reservation.
- Leave them to me.
Hey, Niles, baby!
- Mr Briscoe.
May I help you?
- Does it look like I need help?
Do you have a reservation?
I know what you're sniffing for.
These guys are all alike.
Mr Lincoln wonders if you've a table for me and the lady.
Mr Lincoln's in luck.
Please seat these people in the enchanted grotto.
The grotto?
Oh, Bulldog!
Enjoy our finest table.
A flash of green and you get what you want.
But look who I'm telling!
Maurice?
It's not to second-guess your creativity, but I thought we agreed we'd serve the soufflé in individual cups?
- I was asked to change.
- On opening night?
Good Lord, no.
Start pouring, man.
Dad, if you're almost finished, I'll call for your car.
Your parking attendant looked familiar.
It was Otto, the waiter.
Didn't have the heart to let him go.
- Hello, Otto.
- 'Who is this?
' It's Dr Crane.
Please bring up car 44.
My innovation.
This way your car will be waiting when you're finished.
We agreed one large bowl for soufflé.
This is crazy!
This is my kitchen!
It's in my restaurant!
One big bowl!
Table 12 is still waiting.
Don't force me to send them free zucchini.
- That's the "in" door.
- What did I hit?
- What happened?
- Help me get him into the kitchen.
That's the "out" door.
- No harm done.
- His nose is broken.
- What shall we do?
- Start ladling out zucchini.
- He's out cold!
- I'll take them to the emergency room.
I'm trying to remain a happy brother, but suddenly we're without waiters or a bartender.
First rule of the kitchen.
Remain calm.
- No, I told you individual cups, you oaf!
- I told him one large bowl!
Are you out of your mind?
Why not just serve it in a baseball glove?
Ridiculous!
How gauche!
I didn't know you had this streak!
Maurice!
No, wait!
Please let me finish!
- It was an oversight.
- Now what?
We make a battlefield promotion.
Congratulations.
Our new head chef.
- Thank you.
- We've a very important clientele.
Two senators and the head of the Immigration Bureau.
Sacre bleu!
Any other names you'd like to drop?
Fine, now we have no chef.
No.
No.
Put the hat down.
You are our new head chef.
I can't cook all this food.
Most of the meals are started.
Dad and Daphne can help us out.
- Otto, cancel car 44.
- 'Who is this?
' Dr Crane!
It's always Dr Crane!
We need your help.
We've got a little disaster.
Disaster?
The staff walked out.
It's a long story.
Daphne, I need you in the kitchen and you behind the bar.
You can gloat later!
I'll pencil it in.
It's not the first time I've washed up for me supper.
Who'll wait on these tables?
Oh, Frasier.
Roz!
I'm glad to see you, too.
This is my date, Brad.
- Pleasure.
- Pretty great, huh?
- Have you got our special table?
- First, I want to discuss something.
- It's probably some surprise.
- Try to fool you!
- What's your poison?
- I'll wait for Roz.
I'd have one now.
Blackmailer!
Honey, I'm really sorry, but Frasier's waiters had a terrible accident and he really needs my help.
- I hope you'll try to understand.
- No problem.
Could I get a menu and some bread and butter?
You from around here?
How about those Supersonics?
Niles is panicking.
I don't know if we can pull this off.
Just tell them what happened.
People are more understanding than you think.
Maybe honesty is the best policy.
Everyone!
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say - Good evening, Frasier.
- Bon appetit!
Gil, I thought you never reviewed opening nights.
I made an exception and brought an entire table of restaurant critics.
Oh, well, that's lovely.
I don't know if I can accommodate you.
We'll take that one over there.
We're salivating to try anguilla.
I hear chef's a wizard with eels.
Eels?
That was his old speciality.
You must try his new speciality.
Scrambled eggs.
Eels it is.
Table four now want Sole Veronique without grapes, spinach instead of broccoli, risotto instead of pasta.
- They also want - Just tell them, "No substitutions"!
- I have trouble saying no.
- So the guidebooks tell us.
- Do you want to get thrown in the tank?
- You're not making this very easy.
You waltz in here, la-di-da, "extra broccoli, hold the capers," then you go out on the fun side of the door.
You want to trade places?
Be my guest.
How dare you use that tone?
All right, stop it!
You're not being asked to do anything you've never done in your own homes.
Now, quick, Niles, kill five eels!
Wait!
What?
Every restaurant critic in Seattle wants anguilla.
Kill eels!
How do you suggest I do that?
You're the chef!
Throw a toaster in the damn tank!
Not to worry.
Eels are on their way.
- Our mouths are watering.
- Our chef is in the process of frying them now.
Excuse me, this is Veal Piccata.
I ordered Veal Marsala.
I'll rectify that at once.
I'll be right back.
Niles, this Veal Piccata has to be Veal Marsala.
The mayor's table all want Cherries Jubilee.
Fine.
You flame them.
How are those eels?
I'm just trimming them now.
- Take them out of the tank!
- Not till I'm sure they're dead!
For heaven's sakes!
What was that?
Big blue flash.
Cherries everywhere.
Lucky it didn't set off the sprinkler system.
We have a safety delay for this - kick in!
- Where do I turn it off?
- Over there.
I hope you're satisfied!
You thinned my brown sauce.
Good news!
That was just a test!
- I want my car!
Now!
- Yes, ma'am, right away.
Otto, bring car 23.
Hurry!
- 'Who is this?
' - It's the voice of God!
Doc, great touch with the sprinklers!
My date's dress is clinging to her like saran wrap!
Every restaurant has to adjust.
You'll remember this as an adventure!
And if they don't remember it, I'll remind them.
Please keep us in mind for your next special occasion.
We plan exciting innovations in the weeks to come.
Starting with our drive-through window.
Number 23 is ready.
How much firepower is necessary to embed a cherry in a ceiling tile?
Another question we should have asked before entering the exciting world of food service.
Those eels are starting to stink!
Dad, you've circled like a shark.
Just give us your speech.
You guys will punish yourselves enough without me chiming in.
- Thanks.
- Hey, I'm your dad.
Hello, Happy Brothers Restaurant.
Table for two?
No problem.
Smoke damaged or non-smoke damaged?
You know, we could tell people he died in the explosion.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Caroline, if you've had therapy for two years without much progress, perhaps you've reached a plateau, or you and your therapist have done all you can together.
'Maybe you're right.
He's kind of dry and long-winded.
' Well, that's a long time to spend with a psychiatrist who's dry and long-winded.
Amen to that!
'Thanks, Dr Crane.
I'll think about that.
'Would it be OK if I called back and picked your brain?
' Just consider me your mental banjo.
Well, that's it for this fine Friday.
This is Frasier Crane saying we'll see you next week.
Good show, Frasier.
I've waited for this moment for an entire week.
That's what I love about you.
You work hard and play hard.
I'm looking forward to this weekend.
Even conscientious psychiatrists can have their fill of people's problems.
Hi.
Is one of you Roz Doyle?
Yes.
That's all the clues you're getting.
A little offering from one of your suitors, perhaps?
A nice string of pearls, a teardrop pendant It's a brick of cheese!
On the right chain it should look smart.
It's from my family.
They're at my uncle's dairy farm in Wisconsin.
- Why didn't you go?
- There wasn't time.
Now I wish I had.
Frasier, we always have so much fun.
Once there was this cheese platter, and my uncle spoke in cheese language.
Instead of saying, "Hello.
How are you"?
He said, "Hello, Havarti"?
Someone else would go, "I'm Gouda.
" I don't know what would come after that?
If I'd been there, the sound of a gunshot.
Don't make fun.
I miss those people.
There, there.
- We play games and sing songs.
- I know.
And Aunt Libby does cannonballs into the lake.
The memories must be And Uncle Ned has too much to drink and puts pants on all the cows.
If you want family fun tonight, why don't you come to my dad's birthday?
I forgot about it last year, but I'll make up for it this year.
There's just one rule - no work, just a good time.
- Frasier, I wouldn't be much fun.
- Roz, I insist.
I enjoy partying with you and I hate to see you like this.
I Camembert it.
How sweet.
All right!
It's someone's birthday.
I hope you're in the mood for a party.
I know I am.
- You're bloody impossible!
- You're a bloody nag!
Don't you shake that cane at me!
For heaven's sake, not again.
I know what I want for my birthday.
Fire Daphne.
You'd have to rehire me first, because I quit.
I hope I never see that hateful old canker sore ever again.
- What is it this time?
- The usual.
I ask him to exercise and he twists his face up like a baby.
You asked by pouring my beer away and banging a pot with a spoon.
- I don't have to be your friend.
- Good.
I got a friend here who isn't a yammering nag.
- Eddie, fetch!
- Stop this!
Pick your argument up tomorrow.
Tonight we're having a party.
I went down to Emilio's.
I got some lemon cake, snacks, and champagne.
Can we agree to have fun this evening?
That'll be probably Roz.
She's down and in need of a happy environment.
I could use the same thing.
Can you just agree to a truce?
- Roz, hello!
- Hi, Frasier.
Hey, Martin.
Happy birthday.
You didn't have to do this!
Thanks.
I'll model it for you later.
He's already modelling one.
I have a nice evening planned.
Can we try to be civil?
You unprincipled charlatan!
You unconscionable fraud!
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thanks.
Niles, what are you talking about?
You spoke to a patient of mine today.
Caroline.
As a result of your fast-food approach to psychiatry, she left me.
Caroline was your patient?
I Two years of my hard work wiped out by your two-minute McSession.
Niles, I merely suggested she consider a change.
Based on what diagnostic method?
One potato, two potato?
Fancy that.
A member of this family not taking the time to do something.
- Quack!
- Exactly, Dad.
Quack!
- I was talking to her.
- Don't you raise your cane at her.
Roz, where are you going?
- I think I'd better leave.
- We were just talking.
I'd just rather be by myself.
Thanks, guys.
I had a wonderful time.
- You've ruined her evening.
- Her evening?
It's my birthday.
Let's get that underway.
Who's ready for cake?
I don't want to keep you all here, so let's get this over with.
Thanks for a great party!
There's nothing wrong with Dad's lungs.
Every light in the city is out.
It must be a blackout.
There's worse places to be.
Like the elevator Roz!
Why couldn't it be Daphne?
Stop doing that!
We need to get some light.
Eddie, where are you?
Excuse me, Dr Crane.
Quite all right, Daphne.
Daphne, where are the lamps?
They're in the kitchen.
Dad, light a fire.
Excuse me, Dr Crane.
Not your fault, Daphne.
Where are you, Eddie?
I've found him!
That's better.
I'll get my radio.
See what's going on.
Roz, are you all right?
I'm fine.
The blackout hit as the elevator opened on the 14th floor.
I stood there trying to decide whether to come back up here, or take my chances in the streets with the muggers and the weirdos.
So I went down a couple of flights then I changed my mind.
Somebody's probably looting my apartment.
There's a thriving black market in badly designed Formica cofee tables.
At least I have my own sense of style.
You won't buy a chair unless a fey French aristocrat sat his fat fanny in it.
Louis XIV was not fey.
Everyone wore garters then.
- If they were fey they did.
- He was a big man.
Silence, enfants!
We can all sit in the dark and be miserable or we can try having fun.
- I'll call Maris.
- Niles has voted.
Who votes for fun?
I'm going to go get a glass of wine.
The steaks we were having are out.
I'll see what I can find.
- Sorry, Dr Crane.
- Excuse me, Daphne.
Power's out all over Seattle.
They're working on it.
Thank God I got you.
Don't panic.
It's important to stay calm.
About the blackout.
Maris, take off your slumber mask.
No, darling, don't panic.
Honey.
No, honey, we're Honey.
She's fine.
Yum scrum, pig's bum.
Here's something nice - half-gallon tubs of vanilla fudge.
Let's have these right away before they melt.
They'll stay cold for at least 24 hours.
Shut up!
Well, I don't like to be nostalgic, but it was great when you forgot my birthday.
What we need to do is liven things up a little bit.
How about a game?
What was it we played at the Vanderkelins while they costumed the servants for the living chess match?
I remember!
It was "I'm the dullest person".
Pick a game someone else has a chance of winning.
That's got things shaking.
Come on, Dad.
Come on.
The object is, we all get pennies and we try to get the other person's pennies.
Please, slow down!
All right, if I were going to go I would say, "I am the dullest because I've never been on a roller coaster".
Everyone who has been on a roller coaster would give me a penny.
Now, we all have our pennies.
- Will you go first, Daphne?
- I can't think of anything.
Say whatever comes to mind.
"I'm the dullest person because " Because I've never made love in a lift or a phone booth or on an airplane or a merry-go-round.
That's good, but it should be something someone might have done.
I was in college.
I was trying to find myself.
You just needed to look under the nearest man.
All right, Dad, get our pennies.
I'm the dullest person because I've never been to France.
That's the spirit.
Niles?
Something you've never done.
I'm dull because I've never sabotaged my brother's career.
- Will you give it a rest!
- Your father could show you how to do that.
Will you stop people?
You are torturing me!
I could report you to Amnesty!
- I'm out of here.
- Where are you going?
To sit in the tub with a hair dryer waiting for the power to come back on This blackout could go on all night.
I'll brave the streets and get back.
I hope it isn't like that storm.
I had to coax Maris from under the bed by tying a Prozac to some string.
- You want to have a little cake?
- No, thanks.
This reminds me of Wisconsin - all dark and deserted.
Isn't that on the licence plate?
What's the real reason you didn't go?
You've made it before.
Well No.
You don't want to hear any more problems and I don't blame you.
I think we have time for one more caller.
Well, every year I go to my reunion and my relatives crowd around me and I answer the same questions.
"No, I'm not married.
" "No, I don't have kids.
" "Yes, I still have that tattoo.
No, you can't see it.
" It'd be nice if I could at least say, "I have a great career.
" You do have a great career.
Tell them that.
They say I spend four hours on the phone every day with a bunch of losers and whackos and then some tedious know-it-all gives them pointless advice.
That's not me talking.
That's my Uncle Ned.
The cow haberdasher.
Roz, ten years ago, KACL didn't have any women producers.
You're a pioneer.
You've won awards.
You help people.
Sounds right when you say it.
There's more than your job.
You should explore other areas of your life - interests, or maybe a serious relationship.
Maybe you're right.
How long can I chase 25-year-olds that are all looks and no substance?
- Exactly, Roz.
- I'm asking.
Three, four years?
- Oh, bloody hell!
- Daphne, are you all right?
I broke your father's souvenir spoon rest from Atlantic City.
Oh, good.
When I have my own kitchen I'll put my spoons right on the damn counter.
I've always said, when I save $2,000 I'll get a place.
- How much have you saved?
- 4,000.
I know what you're thinking.
What's wrong with me?
Why do I stay?
I was thinking I'm overpaying you.
My friends say, "You should be on your own, have a place, have a life.
" Why do I stay here?
Could it be that maybe you you like us?
My grandmother had a cat, a mangy old thing, kept ruining the furniture.
I asked her why she kept it and she said she liked having another heartbeat in the house.
It just makes me feel like I'm unambitious.
I could work in a hospital or a clinic.
Maybe that's not what's important to you right now.
You like being part of a family.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, I suppose.
Although my friends wonder how I can live with such demanding men.
- They call me demanding?
- No, they call you a pompous ass.
- But you've learned that I'm not.
- No, I've learned to work around it.
I'm getting a beer.
I know it's bad for me, will make me fat, and keep me from exercising.
- You have anything to add to that?
- Yes.
Happy birthday, you old sod.
They try to confuse you on purpose.
Room temperature.
Just like England - another place I'll never get to.
Dad you used to talk about going to Europe when your hip improved.
Now you say you'll never get there.
What's changed?
Nothing!
My hip's the same as the year ago.
I thought I'd be better but I'm not and probably never will be.
You're happy just sitting on your can, doing your show, living in your head.
I'm used to being out there.
Eddie!
Listen, Dad, you can still travel.
No, you can.
If you can't walk around Paris, you could sit at a nice café and let Paris walk past you.
Maybe buy a drink for a beautiful mademoiselle.
Get a nice bottle of imported beer.
- I only like Ballantine's.
- In Paris, Ballantine's is imported.
And you are the handsome Américain with the adorable accent.
They like moustaches over there, don't they?
Garage door's electric.
Can't open.
Bad lady upstairs.
Big dog.
Need place to die.
- Same to you, buddy!
- Who are you talking to?
Some rowdy guys downstairs.
Come on, I want you to introduce us.
- Keep your pants on.
- Let me take your coat.
- Haven't you taken enough from me?
- You're being irrational.
- Sticks and stones.
- You're acting just like Dad.
You take that back!
You're not really mad at me.
I didn't tell that woman to leave you.
I merely suggested it as an option.
It was all her choice.
Could it be you're upset because you couldn't help that woman?
I really hate that when you take a simple criticism and turn it back on me.
- I think I'm right.
- Of course you are.
Why do you think I hate it.
Do you have any idea what I went through trying to help that woman?
Yes, I think I do.
Niles, you're a perfectionist.
As faults go, that's not such a bad one.
Just would've been nice if I'd been the one to say it was time to go.
Instead, she had to hear it from some glib, albeit insightful, radio pundit.
Those guys invited us to a blackout party.
- They got cold beer.
- And Jarlsberg.
I was feeling a bit down, but suddenly I'm in a party mood.
- What about our party?
- There are people downstairs.
- Come on, Frasier.
- No, thank you.
I'm not in the mood.
- Don't be a party-pooper.
- Let him be.
He was always that way.
Maybe it's time for a lesson about living the life of this party-pooper.
I spend the whole week ministering to the troubled, the neurotic and the sometimes plain goofy.
Then I hang up my earphones and it doesn't end there.
On the street, at the café, even in this building More people come up for help.
More problems.
I suppose they just think it's OK.
It's what I do.
But every time I try to help them it costs me a little piece of myself.
A little bit here, a little bit there Till I feel like a zebra carcass on the Serengeti surrounded by vultures.
This was one of those weeks.
I had my escape planned.
I was coming for an evening of fun with my family.
But I get you four of you going at each other like the Borgias on a bad day.
So I roll up my sleeves.
And I tend to each one of you, and you all feel better.
And the minute you get the whiff of mesquite coming from down below you are out the door without so much as a "thank you".
Well, thank you for the invitation, but I'm fed up with people and their problems.
The doctor is out.
Oh, come on.
- Apologies accepted.
- Great!
So you'll come?
No, no I love you all.
I really do.
But I want to be alone, right here, where no one needs anything from me.
- Well, all right.
- I'll bring you some barbecue.
Oh, my God.
It's dark out here.
Oh, for God's sake.
No, I'm not going to do it.
