{START OF EPISODE 1}
Man, who'd have thought?
Hyde getting busted for possession.
I mean, I always thought it'd be, like, armed robbery or pimping.
You know, something cool.
Yeah, Hyde in jail.
Hey, guys, do you think he's anyone's girlfriend yet?
Kelso, he's been in jail for three hours.
Of course he's someone's girlfriend.
He has very pretty eyes.
Well, if he was someone's girlfriend, I think it might look something like this.
Yeah.
Hey there, curlicue, would you like to perform an unspeakable act on me or would you prefer that I perform one on you?
Well, they both sound good.
Dealer's choice.
You have done a horrible thing with a children's toy.
Huh.
Bet you didn't want me to see this, did ya?
Hey!
Welcome back, man!
We were worried about- I'm sorry.
I'm just- I'm so sorry.
Yeah, uh- You know, curlicue is- can be- is a term of endearment.
So, when do we meet your new fella?
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
- Red, we really need to talk about- - No.
No.
No!
- Steven.
!
- No!
I don't want to talk about Steven!
Subject closed.
Red- For God's sakes, Kitty.
We took him into our home.
We treated him like our own son.
Treat him better than your own son.
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not bailing him out.
He can rot in that jail, for all I care.
Actually, uh, they already let him out.
Gave him probation.
Probation?
Well, isn't that just ducky?
You know how they treat their criminals in Russia?
First offense, five years in Siberia.
Second offense, 10 years.
Believe you me, there is no third offense.
Unless the criminal likes to make snow angels.
Hey.
Steven brought that stuff into my house.
And I'm Puttin'a stoP to it before things get out of control.
Oh, out of control how?
Well, I'll tell you how.
Say, chum, where ya headed?
Just to see my best girl Donna, that's where.
We're gonna split a soda pop.
It'll be keen.
Soda pop, eh?
I have something that's even keener than soda pop.
It's called marijuana.
"Mari-what-a"?
Come.
I'll show you.
Hyde, you were right.
Marijuana's the bee's knees.
Yep.
All it takes is one puff to make you hopelessly addicted.
I am hopelessly addicted.
Here's a new shipment, fresh from whatever-the-hell country I am from.
Gee whillikers, Eric.
Where have you been?
You missed choir practice.
Sorry, dollface.
But now, thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.
Well, I'm not gonna let a swell kid like you ruin your life.
Not so fast, sister.
I need that for the schoolchildren.
- No!
-  Alas, marijuana has ended my young, promising life.
This is what's happening all over America.
And it could happen in your home, or yours, or yours!
I just don't think that's gonna happen, Red.
Has Hyde ever pressured you to use this stuff?
No.
Absolutely not.
In fact-Yeah, I can honestly say I have never felt any pressure.
Guess who?
It's eitherJackie or the cold, clammy hands of death.
It's Jackie!
Damn it.
Oh, Steven, my hero.
When that cop found my bag, and you said it was yours, and they sent you to the big house it was, like, the most romantic thing ever.
Yeah, maybe for you.
I was deloused.
Hey, man, you missed your shift at the Fotohut.
You better have a damn good excuse.
- I got busted.
- Damn.
That's a good excuse.
- So what'd they get you for?
- For loving me.
'Cause she's, like, 14?
I got busted for possession.
Oh, man.
Join the club.
Yeah, thanks.
No.
I mean, join the club, man.
We meet every Thursday.
We're tryin' to raise money for a field trip to Amsterdam.
- Hey there, Red.
Takin' out the trash, I see.
-  Yeah, well, better late than never.
Is that supposed to mean something, Bob?
No.
Just happened to notice that that low-life Hyde you've been harboring has been busted for possession.
My gosh!
That stuff was right here in our own neighborhood?
To think of all the times we had to drive across town - to get it!
- Lx-nay, Midge!
Well as you all know, we had a little incident yesterday.
And I think that as a family, we should discuss rational solutions to make sure that this never happens again.
Can I start?
Um, I'm not comfortable living with a criminal.
I think we should kick Hyde out.
All in favor?
Laurie, stop it.
Red, what do you think?
Kick him out!
Kick him out!
Kick him out!
Kick him out!
Laurie, there is no way we're kicking Steven out.
Steven, we're kicking you out.
- Yea, Daddy!
- Red!
- What?
Dad, that's not fair.
- Not fair?
I took him in.
I gave him a shot.
He blew it.
It's his fault.
Look, I don't want it in my house.
I don't want it around you two.
I just don't want it!
Red, putting him out on the street is not the solution.
This young man needs our guidance now more than ever.
No, Mrs. Forman.
It's cool.
Lf, uh, Red thinks that I'm not good enough to live in this house then I guess I'm not.
You know what?
You're-You're bull- l- I'm-You're very- I'm- I'm very mad at you!
God, this sucks!
I can't believe Red's kicking you out.
I mean, I'm sorry, where are you supposed to go?
I'm gonna go to the Fotohut.
I'll sleep on the floor.
They got a hose out back.
Mrs. Forman made me a sandwich.
Man, this is so wrong!
I'm not gonna let you get kicked out for something we all do.
Hey, hey, don't go draggin' me into this.
You know what?
I'm gonna tell Red that I do it too.
No!
Have you suddenly become the stupidest man ever?
I mean, is Kelso no longer the reigning king?
Oh, I'm the king.
This can work.
If I tell Red, then he's gonna be a hypocrite for kicking you out and not making me go with him.
Because, I mean, he can't kick me out.
Because, deep down, he loves me.
Look, Forman.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, you know?
But you getting into trouble is not going to help me get out of trouble, okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Everybody just stop worrying, all right?
I'll be fine.
Yes.
It will be good for you in the Fotohut.
Maybe you will develop some character.
Get it?
Develop?
Oh, fine.
I guess I'm not funny.
Kiss my brown ass.
Here's your tea, Leo.
Oh, wow.
Tea, man.
That's, like, exotic.
Hey, look at me.
I'm the king of England!
- Off with her head.
-  - Tea.
- Well, um l- I think it's great that Steven has a boss who cares enough to- to come over and talk to us on his behalf.
So, um, I'm just gonna let you fellas get to know each other.
Sit up straight, Leo.
Hey, man, I don't think you should kick Hyde out, because he's a good kid.
- He's a doper.
- Well, you say that like it's a bad thing, man.
Hey, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I've indulged once or twice myself.
Really?
I'm shocked.
Yeah, I know.
Upstanding businessman.
Last guy you'd expect.
But it's true, man.
Well, Mr Hippie.
If you say so, that's good enough for me.
Oh, that's great, man.
Now, please, get out of my house.
-  - Okay, what are you writing?
Jackie and Steven Hyde.
Mrs. Jackie Hyde.
Dr. And Mrs. Steven Hyde?
All right, what's going on?
Okay.
Donna, Steven and I are in love!
Um, you do know that he once compared you to a tick, right?
Oh, really?
Well, if he thinks I'm such a tick why'd he tell the cops the bag was his when it was actually mine?
Are you telling me that bag was yours?
Yeah!
And he went to jail for it!
Isn't that fabulous?
Oh, my God.
You tick.
You're the reason this whole mess happened.
Oh, Donna, stop.
My head is-Whoo!
Jackie, you have to tell the Formans what happened.
Do you know that Red is kicking Hyde out?
Oh, God.
No, no, Donna.
That's perfect!
When Hyde is on the streets, he'll have to turn to me.
And as I care for him and buy him stuff, his love for me will grow.
Oh, my God.
Fine.
I'm telling them.
No!
No, no, no.
You cannot ruin this for me, moose!
Don't tell me what to do, midget.
-  No!
-  Well, well.
Turns out you were all wrong about Steven.
And you wanted to kick him out.
Yes, well-Thanks for telling us the truth, Donna.
And we know it wasn't easy for you especially with Jackie choking you the whole time.
Um, Steven, wait.
You can stay.
Cool.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
That's it?
Isn't there anything else you would like to say to this brave and noble young man?
You're right, Kitty.
Dumb-ass!
Do you realize that you put your entire future at risk?
What kind of a moron would go and take the fall for some little- Crying and crying and crying.
- When she's upset, I'm upset.
-  And the next thing you know- I had to have tea with that greasy old hippie.
And now I have hippie stink on my couch.
Let me tell you something else.
If you ever do anything like that again I will kick your ass so hard your nose will bleed!
And we love you.
So, uh, just so I'm clear everything's back to normal, right?
Yeah, yeah, everything's back- All right, Dad!
I've got something to say!
Eric, for the love of God, don't.
Dad, I do it too.
That's right.
So you can't kick Hyde out.
Honey, we already decided not to kick Hyde out.
Oh.
Then yea.
So, you do it too, huh?
Since when?
Since when?
Uh.
I am so baked.
I think.
No, yeah, I am.
I think.
You know, guys, I've been living my life all wrong.
All I ever thought about was school- studying, reading, homework.
Well, that's over.
Thanks, Hyde.
Hey, man, don't thank me.
Thank my mom.
If she hadn't have passed out, I couldn't have raided her stash.
You have the best mom ever.
Hey, guys, you know what?
Yesterday, I was wrestling with Donna.
And I felt her boob.
It was beautiful and squishy.
Squishy.
Hey, guys, I had this dream that I was kissing my English teacher.
And when I woke up, I was stuck to my bed.
Kelso, man, that's not normal.
You could die.
Hey, isn't your English teacher a guy?
Yeah.
No!
I meant my Spanish teacher.
She's a girl.
Man!
What's in this stuff?
Hey, guys, I'm having the best time ever.
I think.
No, yeah, I am.
Eric?
Eric.
!
Are you on it right now?
I asked you a question.
Since when have you been using this?
Uh, 'bout a week ago tomorrow.
Um, what?
Yeah!
Coming, Mom!
Okay.
Okay, now.
You're both smart boys.
What were you thinking?
- Well, l- I'm not- - Oh, oh, um- - The problem was that we weren't thinking.
- We weren't thinking.
And, you know, with the times we're living in.
Yeah, the times are, like-  - And, um- - Peer pressure.
And the peer pressure.
Thank you, Mom.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and I found that today, the need to experiment- Oh!
Don't try this blaming society crap with me.
You know whose fault this is?
Do you?
Do you?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
It's mine.
- Oh.
All right.
- Okay.
The problem is I've been too lenient.
So, from now on, no more easygoin', devil-may-care, everybody's-best-friend dad.
I'm just- I'm so very nervous.
I'm cracking down.
And I'm cracking down hard.
Starting right now fun time is over!
So where was I for fun time?
- Take it back!
- No, Kelso.
I'm sorry.
Confessing to Red makes Eric the king.
Hey, I shot my toe with a B.B. Gun once.
You're right, Kelso.
You're the king.
Thank you!
I mean, when I say, "For the love of God, don't".
Then, for the love of God, don't.
Donna, that could have meant anything.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake.
All right, excuse me.
But I think we've all lost sight of what's really important here.
We're in love.
All right, all right.
You know what?
Enough of your girly fantasy crap.
None of this would have happened if it wasn't for you.
So get this through your little Easy-Bake Oven head- I don't love you.
I don't like you.
I can barely stand to look at you.
Okay?
Oh, Steven, you're such a bad liar!
All right.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just here to install this smoke detector.
Smoke detector?
Does that detect any kind of smoke?
Long live the king.
Hey, guys, look what I found in my sister Laurie's drawer.
Mints.
A whole month's worth.
They're not minty.
They're not mints.
They're birth control pills, you headgear-wearing moron.
Hey, when I grow up, I'm gonna be handsome.
Really?
Did your Mommy tell you that?
Yeah.
Kelso, you're the king.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- I had a great time on our date tonight.
- Yeah.
When do you think Red's gonna give you back the keys to the Cruiser?
You know, so we could actually leave the property?
I don't know.
Maybe never.
In fact, you're my only contact with the outside world now, Donna.
Do people still laugh out there?
I miss the laughter.
Well, Eric, it's your own stupid fault.
I mean, before you opened your big mouth, Red actually believed that smell was incense.
Yeah, I know.
It's just- He was gonna kick Hyde out, and I wanted to help, and- Oh, helping never helps.
Eric, let's not waste time talkin' about this.
How long to the curfew?
Uh, about one minute.
Now, Donna, I'm not bragging, but if you're properly motivated, I can actually do it in that amount of time.
You don't have to tell me.
- Okay, so- -  Buckle up, Donna, 'cause the next  Five, four - three, two, one.
- No, wait.
But l- Damn.
Curfew, hophead.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Geez, I wish I had a quarter for every time I caught you makin' out with the neighbor girl.
I wish I had a quarter for every time you embarrassed me.
I wish you did too, 'cause then you'd be a millionaire and you could find someplace else to live.
What?
And leave all this?
Okay, fellas.
Who wants brownies and a nice glass of milk?
Oh, geez.
Daddy, I think it's great you gave Eric and Hyde a curfew.
These boys, they need structure.
Well, I'll see ya.
Where do you think you're going?
To night church?
Sorry, honey.
Curfew's for everyone.
But, Daddy, it's me!
Look, what they did is bad but you sneakin' around with Kelso, that's just unpleasant.
But, Daddy, I'm not seeing Kelso.
- Untrue!
- A damnable lie!
A curfew?
I'm stuck in this house with you people all night?
This sucks!
Well, we're just thrilled about it.
All right.
There's an upside to all this.
I took her down with me.
- Nice job.
- Thanks.
Well, isn't this a happy house?
Yeah.
This is not a happy house.
Well, you just said this was a happy house.
Well, that's not what I meant.
It was sarcasm.
Who the hell knows what you mean, when you won't say what you mean?
I don't like how you're treating the children.
Look, Kitty.
I'm not gonna let our kids go down the wrong path.
- But if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.
- Okay.
Maybe you could be a little less strict and a little more loving.
Okay, Kitty.
Enough with the sarcasm.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Please look at me.
Hey!
Psst.
I love you, Steven.
I have secret love powers.
Look at me!
Hmm.
I have 29 teeth.
No, that can't be right.
One, two, three-  Jackie's in love with Hyde, and I have nothing.
Oh, look.
I found an M&M.
Oh, no.
My life sucks.
Okay, I really hope no one smelled that.
All right!
I'm the best-looking person in this room.
No.
In this whole town.
No!
No, in this whole state.
No.
Dumb-asses.
So, how's it going?
Real good.
The foreign kid just ate somethin' off the floor.
Okay, well, um- Your father's gonna drive me to work.
That's right.
And if you do anything wrong, I'll know because one of you is a snitch.
You just think about that while I'm gone.
Well, they're not gonna do anything wrong because I brought a box of activities to occupy their time.
So, um- Be good and have fun.
Do crafts, not drugs!
Ooh, a model airplane and glue.
Where's Steven and Eric?
Um-Your hair is very pretty.
Oh, they can't leave the house.
They're grounded.
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're at The Hub.
Oh, no.
I am the snitch.
Oh, Red is gonna be furious.
Mrs. Forman, may I tell you a little story about oppression?
Okay.
Once I had an ant farm.
And they would not build their tunnels.
I was furious, so I became very strict and stern with my ants.
First they feared me, and everything was fine but eventually the ants broke out and attacked me.
So I had to kill them.
So, um, you think we're being too hard on the kids?
Well, I don't know about that.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm really sad because my ants are dead.
Okay.
Well, Fez, thanks.
You're a good boy.
All the ladies want a piece of Fez.
-  - What are you doing?
Oh, just a little security measure in case anybody tries to escape.
Red, no.
Those are my Christmas bells.
Those are happy bells.
Well, then they're doing their job because I'm happy.
Let's have some cake.
Okay.
And let's watch some TV, because that makes us all happy.
Okay, here we go.
The Brady Bunch Variety Hour is on.
Oh, who the hell gave those people an entire hour?
Well, I think this program is fun for the whole family.
They've got-They've got Charo and- and the rock band KISS.
Okay, see?
Now, this is nice.
A nice family who gets along and sings and dances.
Yeah, I love the Bradys.
Oh, remember that episode where Mr. Brady went completely insane - and put bells on all the doors?
-  Hey, did you see the one where Greg was a real wiseass and Mr. Brady took him outside and cleaned his clock?
Did you ever see the one where I hated living here?
That one's my favorite.
Well, I hope you're happy, because now you've upset your sister.
Oh-You know what?
Forget it, Dad.
Enjoy yourself.
Get your shots in now.
Because when I'm gone, oh, I'm gonna be long gone.
I got no place to go, so I'm gonna stay here.
But the tension's nice.
Reminds me of home.
Finally.
Now I can enjoy the show in peace.
Oh, this show is crap.
- Feel funky - Whoo!
- Feel good - Whoo!
Gonna tell you I'm in the neighborhood Gonna fly like a bird on the wing Hold on to your hat, honey Sing, sing, sing, sing  I got the music in me I got the music in me I got the music in me I got the music in me I got the music in me I got the music in me Yeah  Thank you.
Thank you.
And welcome to The Forman Bunch Variety Hour.
And, boy, do we have a great show for you tonight.
Sorry, Mom.
We can't stay for the show.
No.
!
Why not?
Living at home is unbearable, so we've decided to run away.
-  No.
!
- Yea!
So, thanks for everything, Mrs. F. Well, you boys can't run away.
Who's gonna do the square dance with Shields and Yarnell?
Well, let Laurie do it.
She's been makin' out with Shields all day.
That's a lie!
Well, when will I see you again?
Don't worry, Kitty.
I'll take care of them.
Ladies and gentlemen, star of stage and screen, ShirleyJones.
Hi, Mom.
- Mom?
- That's right, Kitty.
- We're Partridges now.
- This is gonna be great.
I'm pretty sure I can nail Susan Dey.
No.
Partridges?
You can't live in a bus.
There's no toilet.
Well, it may be inconvenient, Kitty, but we do get to spend a lot of time together.
That's right.
Mrs. Partridge quit her job to form a family band.
Yep.
It's all a matter of choices, Kitty.
I guess you just chose to be a bad mother.
Hey, Shirley.
Can I come?
I play the tambourine.
Oh, I'm sorry, Laurie.
No whores on my show.
Oh, fine.
Hey, Shields.
Wait up!
Aaah!
Cuchi-cuchi-cuchi!
- Whoa, whoa- - Can it, Charo.
Yeah!
Well, I am not gonna let that happen.
Oh, no.
This is crap.
Oh, no.
Honey.
Yep.
He thought he could sneak out.
So.
What now, Ho Chi Minh?
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Playtime is over.
Your friends are no longer allowed in the house.
- Wait.
What?
- No, no.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Fine, we'll talk about it in the morning.
We'll talk about how your friends are no longer allowed in the house.
You know, I have an interesting idea.
Why don't we not punish him?
Why don't we try a little of that forgiveness thatJesus was always talking about?
No, no.
This is for his own good.
Look, in order for Eric to be a happy, well-adjusted adult he has to be miserable now.
That's just good parenting.
If I was to be Mr. Nice Guy now do you know what would happen to Eric in a few years?
Do you?
Oh, Eric.
Breakfast.
Well, there's my sweet little baby boy.
Why oh why didn't I discipline you?
Shut up and eat your cornflakes.
That's what.
Never surrender, Kitty.
Never retreat.
We're winning.
The fact that Eric was desperate enough to climb out his window shows that everything is working.
Surprise.
This is so great.
I didn't know you delivered.
-  -  Bed check, dumb-ass.
Holy crap.
No, it is not a bed check.
We just wanna say good night - and- and we love you very, very much.
-  -  - What are you doing?
Oh, just nailing his window shut.
- For his own good.
- What if there's a fire?
Well, then I guess you can just light your dope with it, dopehead.
Donna!
- Get out.
- Whoa.
Not so fast, Laurie.
Oh.
Ow!
Ow!
You idiot!
Red's doing bed checks.
-  -  Bed check.
And bless Mommy and bless Daddy and bless Grandma- Oh.
Hi, Daddy.
Sorry to bother you, kitten.
Kelso, get your hand off my ass.
- It was an accident.
- Shh!
- It's still there.
- It's still an accident.
- Kelso, it's still there!
- Yeah.
You know, Steven this hatred thing you have for me is just you protecting yourself.
- Okay.
- It's true.
You're afraid to reach the peaks of love for fear of being dropped off a cliff.
Well, I'm your safety line, Steven.
So grab me.
Go grab yourself, freak.
Okay, bed check.
Here we come.
- Get out!
-  Kitty, you're warning him.
I'm not warning anybody.
Getting closer.
!
Okay, um- - We just-We wanted to say good night- -  And, um, that you're a good boy and even though you do some things that we don't like, we still love you.
And I'm watching you.
And I'm cherishing you.
-  - Oh, no, Jackie.
They're still out there.
What was that?
Oh, and they want our pants.
You hear that?
I don't hear anything.
That's right.
Nothing.
That's the sound of discipline.
No, that's the sound of jail.
This house used to be fun, until you made it miserable.
Well, I'm sorry, Kitty, but I think it's working.
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, you do?
- I just said I did.
Red.
Oh!
Hell's bells!
It's Red!
Run for it!
Freeze!
Daddy, thank God you came.
They were kidnapping me!
Oh, shut up.
That's it.
I have had it.
You know what this means?
More discipline.
- No.
No.
- Oh, yes.
Playtime is over.
Oh, stop saying that.
Your cracking down is not working.
Hell, I could've told him that a week ago.
Now is not the time to be a porky mouth.
Red, I want my house back.
- I once had an ant farm- - Oh, honey, no.
Not now.
Okay.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
You are going to remember that he's a good son and you are going to remember that he's a good father because I am not happy with the way this house is running.
- Now you see what you've done?
You've made your mother unhappy.
- No, he didn't.
I'm not happy with everything.
I'm not- I'm not happy with windows being nailed shut and I'm not- I'm not happy with people sneaking around and- and I'm not happy with my Christmas bells on the front door.
Well, Kitty, what do you want me to do?
Pretend that nothing happened?
Yes.
- No.
- Fine.
Then-Then that's it.
Then I'm staying home.
I'm staying home full-time, and I am- I am taking back my house, and that's the way it is.
Now, you get upstairs and take those nails out of the windows and you stop being such a sneaky smart mouth and you- Honey, you've gotta stop eating stuff off the floor.
Now, everyone, let's just- Let's go back to happy.
So, I guess playtime is over.
I'm sorry, l- I don't remember growing older  When did they - Sunrise - Sunset - Sunrise - Sunset  Swiftly fly the years One season following another Laden with happiness and tears Give it to me one more time, cuchi!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
All right.
They didn't even check our fake I.D.'s.
And I wasted a whole day thinking up my fake name.
Yeah.
Sorry, "Pez".
Let's drink.
- So, fellas, school let out early?
- Yeah.
We're just- - Kelso, shut up.
- Uh, I mean, no.
No, we're old.
We're workers.
We're all construction workers.
Hey, fellas, did you see that brick today?
- Whoo!
- Relax, guys.
It's "Serve a Minor Night" at the old "Don't Have a Liquor License" Saloon.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
I should hope so Dad.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
-  Hey!
Steven!
-  Wow!
- So you're Hyde's Dad?
-  Well, that's what his mother says.
Kidding.
Hello, Mr. Hyde's Dad.
I am Pez.
- I've heard much about you.
- Good things, I hope.
Well, if running out on your family and becoming a drunk is good, then, yes.
Okay, guys.
Let's look over here.
Wow!
Look at you!
You're bigger- and you got your mom's hair and her sideburns.
- So, how long has it been?
- Eight years, 51 days.
Wow!
Time really flies when you're- - Drunk?
- Y-Well.
I was gonna say "havin' fun," but-  same thing.
Yeah, so, uh, how long you been back for?
Well, let's see.
Ah, that must be about a year.
- Ayear?
- Yeah!
Hey, I was gonna call ya.
Oh, you were gonna call me?
Oh, man, that makes you, like I don't know, what, father of the year?
I'll see you around, Dad.
Oh, man, Hyde's upset.
Better go see how he is.
Yep.
One more round, we'll go see how he is.
Hello!
She is just my type: Naked.
I, too, like the naked ladies.
I find them so naked.
Yeah, that's realistic.
I think I'm gonna change the oil in my car- but first I'm gonna take off everything but my cowboy boots.
Sure, I mean if you're in bare feet, you could slip in the oil.
Come on, Donna.
Safety first.
Whoa!
Surefire ways to pick up women.
What kind of lonely losers read this stuff anyway?
Gimme.
"Look deep into her eyes, and use her name often showing that this conversation is just for her".
Hey, Donna.
I think they're onto something, Donna.
What do you think, Donna?
Oh, my God.
I'm taking off my shirt.
Stop it, hands!
Stop it!
Well, Steven, honey, you haven't touched your sandwich.
- You feel okay?
- Yeah.
I'm just not hungry.
Oh, Steven.
Are you finally tired of freeloading?
- Can it, Laurie.
- All I'm saying is Daddy works really hard and nothing here is cheap.
- Except you.
-  - Believe me.
I'm not cheap.
- Fine.
"Free".
Whatever.
Hey, honey, I'm home!
Oh, good.
The hippie's here.
Hyde, man, your dad come by lookin' for you, man.
Which is really freaky 'cause I thought this bald dude was your dad.
Thanks, Leo.
Steven's father is in town?
Yeah, right.
Like he even knows who his father is.
- Eric, you know something about this?
- She's a bitch.
Right.
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
We bumped into Hyde's dad last night.
He'd been back in town, like, a year- hadn't even talked to his own son.
Cool.
Egg salad.
Well, I'm gonna talk to Steven and see how he's feeling about this.
You know what, Mom?
I wouldn't do that.
Hyde likes to bottle those things up.
Good for him.
That's where those feelings should be kept.
Well, what is he gonna do?
Pretend he doesn't have a father?
Kitty, this is a family issue, and, for once, it's not about our family.
Look, the bond between a father and a son is complex and subtle.
You wipe that damn smirk off your face!
Red, when we took that boy into our home it became our job to see him through thick and thin and now it's thick- or thin- I don't know, but he needs us.
Cool egg salad, man.
Fine.
Stick your nose in where it doesn't belong.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Will do.
Bud's comin' over for drinks tonight.
Uh, Mom, do you really want to invite an alcoholic over for cocktails?
Oh, right.
Okay, well, I'll just, um I'll make him a nice Shirley Temple and he can fill up on cheese.
You keep a stack of dirty magazines under your bed?
What?
No!
God, not a stack.
You know, what is a "stack" really?
- Why do you have these down here?
- Now, wait, Donna downstairs you were laughing and cracking jokes about this stuff.
Eric, that was in the basement with our idiotic friends.
- Why do you need them?
Aren't I enough?
- No-Yeah, you're enough.
God, you're- you're plenty.
It's just, uh, that, uh you see, Donna, you see, what I do with dirty magazines is really only interesting to me- with the reading of the articles and the solving of the puzzles and whatnot.
You know what?
I don't wanna know about the whatnot.
I'm outta here.
Oh, no, girls.
She's onto us.
Hello, Jackie.
How are you, Jackie?
- Fine.
- I'm glad, Jackie.
I, too, am fine, Jackie.
Do I have a sty?
No, Jackie.
You, Jackie, do not have a sty- - Jackie.
- Okay- Fez.
I don't know what you're doing, Fez but stop doing it, Fez.
Oh, no.
Now I am turned on.
Oh, wow, man.
Look at all these different nuts intermingling in one bowl.
It's like "Nutstock," man.
Kitty, I think we should rethink our "Don't Throw Leo Out On His Ass" policy.
No, no.
Leo stuck around because he cares about Steven.
And, plus, I can't find my shoes, man.
- Hey.
What's goin' on?
- Oh, good news, Steven.
- Your dad's coming over tonight.
- Screw that!
- No, Steven, it's a good thing, I think.
-  - I got nothing to say to him!
- Well, we have fancy nut mix.
Hey, Red!
Remember me?
Of course.
I wasn't the one passed out in the gutter.
Yeah, I have this weird condition where I drink a case of beer and fall down.
Hey, Red.
Man, you're lookin' good.
Have you lost, um hair?
Steven'll be right out.
Hey, man, nice shoes.
Are those mine?
- Hello, Bud.
- Hi.
- Can I go now?
- It's "May I go" and no.
So, Bud can I get you a drink?
A drink!
A drink of soda.
A nice drink of soda, Bud.
Plus, we have cheese.
Soda sounds great, Kitty.
- Yeah, I'm off the hooch.
-  Oh, really?
- So, no more boozing?
- I heard him.
Yep.
I can finally see clearly.
Isn't it great, man?
It is.
I got a job and an apartment.
- Color TV.
- Ooh, color TV.
That's nice.
Wow, Bud, you're doing great now, huh?
Color TV?
Man.
I remember when I was a kid, I didn't even have a father.
Well, well.
- Who could have foreseen this terrible- - Can it.
Jackie didn't give me the time of the day.
I hate this stupid magazine.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean it.
I love you.
Hey, Fez.
Check this out.
"Tight pants turn a man's derriere into a lady's dream "and an open shirt shows a sexy chest and an irresistible joie de vivre".
Really?
I always thought my joie de vivre was in my pants.
Okay.
I can't believe I'm asking you guys this but if any of you losers had a girlfriend would you still look at those magazines?
Hey, I had two girlfriends- and a little action on the side- and I still looked at those magazines.
You had action on the side?
Who?
You don't know her.
She went to Sacred Heart.
Okay.
Anybody here have an opinion who's not a skeevy pig?
I'm glad you asked, Donna.
If I had Jackie, I would never look at those magazines- Unless she's on the phone or went shopping or took a short nap.
Look, Donna this is just the way guys are.
Okay?
I mean if Forman was actually dating the- the "Naughty Campus Coeds" he'd be locked in a bathroom looking at naked pictures of you.
He's right, so- Are there naked pictures of you?
My leg!
- Hey, knee him in the groin!
-  Oh.
!
Oh, my, God!
She did it!
So how's your cocoa?
Chocolaty good.
Thanks.
That's good 'cause I think your father has really changed.
He is not the same man I used to know and the marshmallows make it extra good.
Well, at least you knew him, Mrs. Forman, 'cause I never did.
Okay, well, here's your chance.
Maybe now you can make some new, happy memories.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
-  -  Yeah!
Yeah, you know what, Mrs. Forman?
No.
Are you sure?
'Cause I kinda think you're bottling things up.
I'm not bottling anything!
Well, hi, there, beautiful.
And how are you?
Not good, you dirtbag.
That's what I thought you'd- Excuse me.
I am not going to help you cheat on your girlfriend.
But I don't have a girlfriend, you silly librarian.
Don't you lie to me.
I heard everything.
I was right under that mattress and that Donna sounded really upset.
No!
No, no.
Sh-She's okay.
Really.
Excuse me.
My turnoffs include unfaithful men.
Didn't you read my biography?
Um- l-You know, I was just getting to it.
Sorry, but Donna is a nice girl and you are a filthy, filthy boy!
You filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy boy!
Hey!
You can't ditch me, then walk back into my life eight years later and expect everything to be okay.
- You screwed me!
- I did.
You're right.
I know.
And- You what?
You know?
What do you mean you know?
I got no excuse.
I was a jerk.
I've been a jerk my whole life.
And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry and hope that you'll believe me.
You jerk!
How am I supposed to yell at you now?
I was gonna yell!
I was gonna tell you off!
I think you should.
I mean, you wanna yell?
Go ahead.
- I deserve it.
- You're ju-You're caving?
That just makes it worse!
Come on, man.
Give me something!
- You want a beer?
- Yeah!
Give me a beer!
- Well, hello, Jackie.
- Hey, Fez.
Hey, Fez.
Nice ass!
Why, thank you, Kelso.
Oh, my God.
What the hell's that smell?
Well, Jackie, it's a combination of musk and a little thing I like to call "Fez".
Whoa, Fez!
What are you doing?
Showing off my joie de vivre.
- You like?
- No!
So, what?
This was all a waste?
The pants, the chest, the manly smell the "Jackie, hello, Jackie, Jackie Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie"-Worthless?
Not worthless- Hilarious.
Okay, look, Fez, you're not bad-looking.
I mean, some girls like that exotic, grimy look- but only the cheapest, most sluttiest girls will like that.
I see.
Damn, Fez!
Looking good.
Hey, so, thanks for the singles at the nudie bar, huh.
Hey, hey, hey!
You gotta tip the girls or they ignore ya.
- Yeah.
- So, they takin' care of you here?
Yeah, yeah.
It's good.
It's great.
- It's a nice place.
- Oh, yeah.
That's nice.
I like my place too.
It's good.
It's got an extra room.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
So, if you ever wanna, you know, come by or whatever.
You know?
I'm not usin' the extra room.
Hence, the term "extra room".
Yeah.
Yeah, the rent's due, but they don't evict you for, like, three months so, I still got two days.
So, you lookin' for a loan, Bud?
Well, will ya look at that?
A father and son brought together by- Oh, my goodness!
I think it was me!
- Don't gloat, Kitty.
- Mr. Wrongie!
Fine.
Once in 26 years!
Live it up, Kitty!
Oh, crap.
Ta-da Wow, Eric.
It's a room.
Not just any room.
See?
No more dirty magazines.
I threw 'em all out.
And you know what, Donna?
I don't miss 'em.
Eric, you didn't have to do that.
I mean, I understand why you need them.
- You do?
- Yes!
You're disgusting!
- What?
- It's okay.
All guys are.
You're a revolting gender.
You know, we really are.
But you're disgusting in a cute, harmless way and I guess I love you for that.
I love you too.
Let me make it up to you.
I can have a naked girl in here in 10 seconds.
- Oh, great.
Send her in.
I'll see you later.
- Shut up!
Steven, good.
I wanted to have a talk with you.
- What are you doin'?
- Oh.
- I'm movin' in with Bud.
- You're movin' in with Bud?
- Yeah, Red.
It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.
Steven, your dad is not good.
Yeah.
I know, but, you know, he's my dad.
- Yeah.
He's your dad.
- Yeah.
Anyway.
Red, thanks for everything.
You know?
Really.
Hey, do me a favor.
Would you tell Mrs. Forman?
- I don't want to have to deal with the whole crying thing.
- You think I do?
Nah, I'll just tell her that, you know- Anytime you need a place to stay, you're welcome here.
- That'll make her feel better.
- Yeah.
That sounds good.
Thanks.
Yeah, so, what?
You don't wanna hug, do ya?
-  God, no.
- Good.
- 'Cause you're not gettin' one.
- Right.
- Well, sis-boom-bah.
- Sure this is okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Before you got here I got the thumbs-up from the old ball and chain.
- She's great.
You'd like her.
- Oh.
Well, if she's so great, are you sure you need me?
Look, I've been over this again and again and again- And, yes, I do.
Okay.
Well, yea, team.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Boo!
Damn it, Fez!
Oh!
Damn, Fez.
Fez, what the hell are you doing?
Yeah, I don't know if you know this but you're dressed like a girl.
And not a nice girl.
Kelso, you spilled juice all over your shirt.
- You look stupid.
-  Yeah.
Hey, Kelso, while you're over there, would you Please, Please toss Fez a Pair of Pants?
Or at least a skirt.
No, I am Dr. Frank-N-Furter from The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
You know, my Bible-thumping host parents were really upset about my rock-hard ass.
Fez, put it away or take it outside.
So, Eric, do you wanna get out of here?
- Do something fun for Halloween?
- I do.
I gotta go to this stupid Halloween party with Laurie's stupid friends.
Not only do I have to wear a suit but all of her guy friends act like they've done it with her before.
- Uh, Kelso- - Leave it.
Okay.
Whatever.
There's nothing to do.
It's like we're too old to trick or treat and too young to die.
Oh, hey, we could take Fez to Chicago and peddle his ass for beer.
I'm game.
No, Eric, I meant maybe there's something, you know, we could do.
Together.
-  I doubt it.
- Oh!
That is a burn.
- Wait.
What?
- No, l- No, I didn't- I didn't mean it like that.
Nope, sorry, Eric, that was a burn.
And what's burnt is burnt.
And what's burnt is Donna.
We're out of fun things to do?
You're already bored of your girlfriend?
No, I meant this town not you, pretty lady.
Hey, you know what'd be fun?
Is if we were in an Alfred Hitchcock movie right now and we didn't know it, and then someone told us and we're like, "Oh, man, I'm in a movie".
- Yeah, okay, I'm outta here.
- Wait, but I thought we- - Get bent.
- Okay, I'll do that.
You know what will cheer you up?
A little trick-or-treating.
Hello?
Stop bouncing that damn ball and let's do something.
Yeah, you know, I can't, Fez, 'cause I can't even look at you.
I don't know whether to throw you out or throw you down and make sweet love to you.
You know, that says more about you than it does him.
Well, I'm not the one dressed like a damn girl.
Well, the damn girl has your ball.
- Like I care about a- -  Man, that's my ball.
Oh, these heels are killing me.
Okay, Fez, that's it.
Give the ball back, and no one gets hurt.
-  -  Hey, you guys, you wanna go outside and watch Eric and Fez run around?
Someone might get hurt.
It's funny when people get hurt.
Especially when they're in their underwear.
That's great.
The only person dumb enough to get hurt around here is you.
Okay, Jackie, I'm really starting to get sick-  That's great.
I'll give you the ball, Eric.
Just don't fall.
I don't want anyone to fall.
No falling.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Okay, Fez.
Well you got a bad sprain here.
Not to- to mention a run in your stocking.
So, you were running around chasing him on the roof because he took your little rubber ball.
It wasn't a ball.
It was a SuperBall.
Yeah, you should see that thing bounce.
It's pretty super.
Dumb-asses.
Steven, Eric, um, get Fez a blanket.
He needs to cover his- He just- He needs to cover up.
Get off me, you girl.
- What-What happened?
- Honey, you just- you had a little touch of vertigo there.
So, just stay away from heights for a while and you'll be fine.
Oh, see?
You see that, Jackie?
Fez hurt himself.
There is someone "stupider" than me.
It's not his fault he's stupid.
He's foreign.
What's your excuse, stupid?
Well, I know one thing's for sure.
There's definitely someone bitchier than me.
Oh, you better not mean me.
Oh, I so mean you!
- Oh.
- Nice burn.
- Top shelf.
- Thanks.
Well, now, that's strange.
Midge's car's right there.
Bob said she wasn't home.
In fact, I haven't seen her for days.
Maybe she went to the store and forgot where she lived.
Oh, that's- that's wrong.
Okay, Fez, this'll cheer you up.
With these you can look into the Pinciotti's house and frequently enjoy a naked Midge, up close and personal.
That's exactly how I like my naked Midges.
Oh, but, Fez, be warned.
If Bob approaches a naked Midge, look away.
Oh, for the love of God, look away.
Okay, let's practice.
Naked Midge, naked Midge, naked Midge - naked Midge, Bob.
- Ay.
- Okay, I think you're gonna be okay.
-  No, okay.
Sure.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Red, I need you to take this soup up to Fez.
No, Kitty.
He's wearing ladies' underwear.
So, uh, no.
Well, crazy bird lady from next door called me.
Her bingo cruise got stuck out on Lake Michigan so she asked me to feed her birds.
So, you have a choice.
Feed the birds, or feed the Fez.
Give me panty boy's damn soup.
Hello, pretty birds.
Hello, pretty damn big birds.
It's your Aunt Kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
Oh, I've seen this one.
Those guys think that Cary Grant's a secret agent, but he's not.
It's a case of mistaken identity.
Right, like you've mistaken me for someone who wants you here.
Right.
-  Wait.
-  - Oh, kick back.
I'll get it.
- No, it's the paperboy.
-  - Well, Mr. Forman, you have to answer the door.
Look, I forgot to pay him for the last couple of weeks and I didn't pick up any cash, so, just ignore him.
Red, I don't think you understand, okay?
- L- I can't let a doorbell go unanswered.
-  - Don't answer the damn door.
- I gotta.
- Don't.
- But I gotta.
All right.
Fine.
You pay him, kettlehead.
Hey, Forman.
I want my money.
Oh, l- Oh.
There's no Formans here.
See for yourself.
Then why does it say Forman on your shirt?
Oh, I borrowed the shirt.
That's a bunch of bullcorn, Forman.
Now, give me my money.
I'm not Forman.
All right, look.
Don't you think you're taking this paperboy thing a little too serious?
I'm a very serious paperboy.
Okay, you know what this is?
This is a case of mistaken identity.
See, you are mistaken about my identity.
Fork it over, Forman!
Look, someone's stealing your bike.
All right, there's two guys stupider than me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Any sign of naked Midge yet?
- No.
Just Bob dragging in big, heavy garbage bags.
What do you suppose is in 'em?
Oh, I don't know.
- I'm guessing garbage.
- Or- You know how Mrs. Kitty said she hasn't seen Midge in a few days?
What if naked Midge is in the bags?
Red.
Red, I killed a bird.
Oh.
And then-And then the rest of them, they just- they glared at me with this- this birdie hate look.
I can't go back there.
I have got to find somebody else to feed those birds.
Somebody who won't flinch in the face of evil.
Oh, and there's Mommy's girl.
Laurie, have I got a job for you.
- Not interested.
- It pays 10 bucks.
All right, I'll do anything for 10 bucks.
And-And for once, that's a good thing.
Donna, what's wrong?
You look sad.
I think Eric thinks I'm boring.
Do you think I'm boring?
Oh, Donna.
Yeah, a little.
But it's not like it's a bad thing.
The world needs people like you.
You're the gray that makes the color- me- pop.
Jackie, I'm not boring.
Eric and I do lots of fun stuff together.
We go to movies- Every Friday, early show.
- What?
I get sleepy.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
Boring, boring, boring.
Boring, boring, boring.
Hey, who's the hot blonde?
That's not a hot blonde.
It's Donna.
Where is she going?
Maybe she's going trolling for men who don't piss her off.
Oh.
That's so funny, Hyde.
I don't know where she's going, but I'm gonna follow her.
Would you stop doing that?
Hey, I don't know how this fits in your murder theory but Bob's wearing an apron with guts all over it and holding a big carving knife.
He did kill Midge.
And I never got to see her naked.
That's 2.50 plus a 50 cent tip 'cause I'm good.
See you next week, Forman.
I'm not Forman!
First of all, Mrs. Forman, I'm using your shower.
And second of all, you have to pay your paperboy.
So, how'd it go?
Did- Did you feed the birds?
Well, uh-Yeah.
I mean, I think I did.
Well, either you did or you didn't.
Well, you didn't either, and you didn't even get pooped on.
Now, go feed your own stupid birds.
Oh, Hyde, please be careful.
I want you to catch some clues but I don't want you stuck in the garbage bag with dead, naked Midge.
Oh, beers.
Hyde is so funny.
Oh-oh, what is he going to do?
Is he going to moon me?
Oh, run, Hyde, run.
Don't forget the beers.
!
The beers.
Why are you in my bathroom?
Get out!
Out!
Out!
I need the shower.
- I got pooped on.
- All right, stop it.
Cut it out.
-  -  That's really hot.
Oh, my God.
You spilled my shampoo, you idiot!
Help.
You can't kill me like you killed Midge, you big doofy.
Midge?
I didn't kill Midge.
She's in Chicago visiting her sister.
Oh, really?
Then what was in the heavy garbage sacks?
Garbage, you idiot.
Oh, well, I guess that explains the giant knife guts all over your apron.
Oh, wait.
No, it doesn't.
- Explain that, killer.
- They were pumpkin guts.
I was making jack-o'-lanterns.
So, you're hiding Midge's body in a jack-o'-lantern.
Clever plan.
Look, there's Midge now.
Not dead or nothing.
Oh, goody.
You can go now.
Thanks.
Midgie, no!
Cover yourself!
-  - Ow.
Give it.
Give it!
Ay!
Donna!
Donna!
Why would she go up the water tower?
Why does she want to be up there?
And why am I talking to myself?
I have to-  Climb.
Donna, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I guess you've caught me.
And if you must know the truth I'm not boring, you ass.
I never said you were boring.
- How'd you know I'd follow you here?
- I saw you spying on me.
I wasn't- No, I wasn't spying on you.
I was teaching Fez how to spy on your naked- Yeah, you know what, I was spying on you.
- What a weird night.
- Hmm.
Please, Donna, tell me there's not a head in that basket.
No, no.
It's just a picnic.
So- So, we're okay?
Ow, you're on my wig.
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna die!
- Eric, hold on.
I'm gonna pull you up.
- No, Donna, you can't do it.
You're just a girl.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you- Hey.
Okay, you got it.
That's- To be honest, it was never really a problem.
- Whoa.
-   Ow.
-  -  Oh, my goodness.
A phone booth.
That's lucky.
-  -    Oh, thank God.
It was just a dream.
Well, I can't go back there.
I just can't.
So, you know, Donna, even though my ankle's sprained I can still probably make it up that water tower.
You know, finish what we started.
I would, but I don't know if I can.
I mean, something happened to me up there too.
Oh, I know.
Vertigo, right?
Fear of heights?
No, Eric.
Fear of sex.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh, don't put Batman in the clam of death, Riddler.
That's just gonna make him mad.
God, you're stupid.
Fez, for the last time, the Riddler can't hear you.
Riddle me this, Riddler.
When Batman escapes from the clam of death who will kick your riddle-telling ass in?
Hey, Fez.
Riddle me this.
Then riddle me this.
Oh, but, Fez, only if you riddle me this.
Ow!
Riddle me this, you son of a bitch!
- Oh, my God!
Guess what!
- Stop!
Fez!
This could be important!
You guys, the Roller Disco Doo-dah is coming to Kenosha next Friday!
Oh, my God!
Guess what!
See, now, that's the kind of thing the judges really frown upon during competition, Steven.
Excuse me?
We're gonna be partners!
Skating partners.
Hey, how about instead, you hit me in the face with a wrench, and I black out?
Steven this is not just a last chance at roller disco.
It's a last chance at love- our love.
Now, will you or will you not skate with me?
I would, Jackie but seeing you there in your cute little skating outfit with all your tassels and sequins I might be tempted to push you down a flight of stairs.
All right.
Jackie, what do you say- you and me, roller disco?
I mean, we used to have some good moves, you know, like, when we did it so it would be like that except for with lights and skates.
Okay.
Um, first of all, you make me sick.
Okay?
Second, you're lame, and you make me sick.
Third, you make me sick, and any one of these guys would be a better partner than you, even Fez.
Really?
Then I am in.
Um, no, I didn't really mean it, Fez.
Oh, then I am out.
Damn it.
Let me in.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
So, who willJackie choose as her roller disco partner?
Who, who, who?
No freakin' way.
Hmm, how very sad.
No one to disco with.
Now, where did I leave my potato chips?
Oh, there they are.
Look at that.
I left my soda back in the other side of the room!
Refreshing.
God, my arm is sore!
Wow, Fez!
Oh, come on, Jackie!
You're gonna pick him over me?
All right.
Watch this.
Jackie, I'm just a roller disco machine and I don't work for nobody but you.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
We'll be partners.
But hear me now.
I want first prize.
If I lose and some stupid, spoiled rich girl wins I'll scream.
I am really hurt.
!
- Hi, sweetie.
How was work?
- Oh, pretty good except for the fact that Dad's getting sued for firing a Price Mart employee.
Okay.
Well, good.
Have a cupcake.
Mom, did you hear what I said?
Uh-huh, and it's just so very unpleasant, I'm ignoring it.
So, have a cupcake.
Earl is suing Dad for wrongful termination.
Earl?
He didn't do his job.
He was always late.
He was a complete dumb-ass person.
Mom, you said "ass".
Well, now so did you.
Give me back the cupcake, foul mouth.
I can't even imagine the mood your father's in.
Actually, he doesn't know yet.
I got the news after he left.
God, Dad is gonna freak.
I don't know how we're gonna tell him.
- Tell me what?
- That, uh Mom said the "ass" word.
Well, now actually, um Red, um- You know, Mom, I got this one.
Okay, uh, everyone here who's not being sued by Earl for wrongful termination raise their hand.
I don't getJackie, man.
I mean, picking Fez over me?
Me?
I have the three things that women want.
I'm-I'm hot, and I'm smart.
That's two things, moron.
No, it's three.
I count hot twice.
I mean, come on.
Kelso, who cares?
It's a stupid roller disco thing.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's silly for me to be jealous.
- You're a good friend, Donna.
- Yeah.
'Cause when you think about it, I mean, what does Fez have going for him except an incredibly sexy accent and an extremely hot body?
Okay.
Now you're being a bad friend, Donna.
I mean, come to think of it, if Fez helps Jackie win a roller disco she might rip his clothes off and have sex with him right there on the rink.
That's how hot he is.
Bad friend, Donna!
Bad!
Oh, look at this guy's complaint.
"Red Forman was habitually ill-tempered".
Am I ill-tempered?
No, sir.
You're like Mary Poppins.
Okay, honey.
Well, it says here you have to go to the labor board.
You know what, Red Forman, you have to go in there and defend yourself.
I'll defend myself.
I'll go in there, and I'll tell those morons that they're wasting my time with this stupid crap!
Or you could control your temper.
No offense, Mom, but what's plan "B"?
Hey, shut it, pal.
Okay, now, see, that's the kind of thing that's gonna get you in trouble.
Now, when-when I get really angry, I just- I laugh it off like this.
- See?
- Oh, geez, Kitty.
That'll never work.
That's dumb.
Oh, my God.
I think Jackie and Fez are next.
Look!
There they are!
Hey!
The next contestants are cheaters.
The brown guy is a robot.
- Robot?
Shut up.
-  Ladies and gentleman welcome to the rink our last contestants of the evening- from Point Place, Wisconsin, Jackie Burkhart and, uh Jackie Burkhart's Partner.
!
Boo!
This is so cool.
- Oh, my God.
They're amazing!
- Oh, did you see that?
Fez just tripped.
- No, he didn't.
- The foreign guy tripped.
That's a deduction right there.
You're gonna lose!
Kelso, shut up.
That's it.
They're doing too well.
What the hell is that?
- It's my secret weapon.
- A marble?
Yep.
I'm gonna chuck it out there so they trip.
You moron, it's one marble.
- Give me that.
Give me that.
- No!
No!
Boo!
Boo!
- Boo!
- Whoo!
Oh, no.
They were good.
I swallowed my marble.
Boo!
- Oh, my God.
You guys were so great.
- I know.
I know.
And even when I almost tripped, my natural grace totally saved us.
Well, I saw plenty of mistakes out there, especially from Fez.
Shut your hole.
- Here come the scores.
-   And the winner of Kenosha's Annual Roller Disco Doo-dah is - Jackie Burkhart and- - Oh, my God!
- Friend.
- Fix!
Fix!
I can't believe it!
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
You-You are my hero- my- my hunky, sexy, foreign skating hero!
And you are my- my spoiled, whiny skating princess.
Oh, Fez, thank you!
-  Yea, champagne!
Yea!
- Yea!
- Yea!
- Get off me.
Kelso, you booed us the entire time.
What?
No!
That was some rude guy.
So I popped him one, and then I was goin', "Ooh," because I hurt my hand when I popped the rude guy.
So you're welcome.
You wanna kiss it?
Let's go, Fez.
Hmm.
Come on, Kelso.
Look at the bright side.
What's the bright side?
The bright side is there isn't one.
Fez has Jackie, and you have to squeeze out that marble.
Now, Mr. Forman, at any point did you ever berate Earl Arthur by calling him any of the following names: Candy-ass dumb-ass, lazy-ass- Uh, it- it just goes on like that.
Well, that sounds like just good-natured ribbin' to me.
- Doesn't sound that way to me.
-   Are you callin' me a liar?
'Cause it's funny if ya are.
Well, you know, Eric worked with him too.
Eric, tell him about Earl.
Actually, I'd be more interested in hearing what Eric thinks about working with you.
Eric?
No.
No, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm here just to answer questions about Earl- old, dumb Earl.
So, you know, you fire away with the Earl questions.
I think we know all we need to know about Earl.
Oh, then good.
I'll just step out then.
Good.
- This was good.
- No, no, no, no.
Eric, just a few more questions.
Is your father ever unnecessarily angry?
Unnecessarily angry.
Well-  you know, what does "unnecessarily" mean really?
I mean, my sister likes to put salt on roast beef but I think it's unnecessary.
I mean, why cover up the flavor of such a delicious meat?
Just answer the question, dumb-ass!
I mean- Good work, Son.
Oh, my God.
I love champagne!
Yes.
Was it any good?
Great.
Just great.
Hey, Fez, I just made up a poem.
- Do you want to hear it?
- Okay.
There once was a guy named Fez who had a really cute butt.
Ta-da!
Well, I have to say I don't hate it.
Hey- Psst Fezzie do you want to know a secret?
If you try to kiss me right now I probably wouldn't stop you.
In fact I'd probably let you do more than that.
- Fez- - Huh!
Good God, man.
Don't do it.
She is drunk.
But, Batman, she is so hot.
But she's drunk.
There is no honor in this.
Ah, screw honor.
Take her pants off.
Ay!
Riddler, nefarious fiend.
Don't do it, Fez.
It's a trap.
Riddle me this, Fez.
Why would Jackie ask you to make out with her if she didn't want you to?
Seriously, he makes an excellent point.
It's the dastardly alcohol talking.
If you and Jackie get together, you want it to be real, not like this.
Honestly, I was rooting for you but imaginary Batman makes a lot of sense.
Then riddle me this.
What does Batman know about girls?
Slides down a pole and lives with a teenage boy.
Enough said.
Okay.
Now I have to say, advantage Riddler.
What are you trying to say, Riddler?
I think you know what I'm trying to say.
Ooh-la-la.
Oh, you want to go, question dork?
Oh, bring it on, bat-wuss.
So are you gonna kiss me, Fez?
No, I am sorry, Jackie.
That's okay.
You still have a very cute butt.
Come on, Kelso.
SoJackie likes Fez.
Big deal.
You're going out with Laurie.
I know.
It's just, you know seeing her with another guy just made me remember all the good times we had together and it just made me sad.
Yeah.
Come here.
You know, Kelso I guess underneath it all you're kind of a good guy.
Sometimes.
Sort of.
- Things'll work themselves out.
- Yeah, I know.
What the hell are you doing?
We can't fight these feelings anymore, Donna.
- What?
- What?
We've been doing this dance all night and, oh, God, I'm tired of dancing.
You moron!
Nobody likes a tease, Donna!
I'm sorry.
You're not a tease.
Come back.
Tease!
I'm sorry.
Donna!
I guess "violent" is the wrong word but, you know, it's definitely some kind of rage.
Although, I mean, you know, Earl had it coming.
I love you, Daddy.
Oh, hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Hour and 10 minutes late.
I can only assume you're Earl.
Yeah.
So, um, sorry.
My, uh, dog got hit by a- a guy in a- - Car?
-  Thanks, Red.
- So, what'd I miss?
- You missed everything.
Okay.
I'm not gonna lie.
Mr. Forman, you- you scare the living hell out of me.
- No offense.
- None taken.
That's kind of his thing.
But, Earl, in light of your failure to show up for your own hearing we have no choice but to rule in favor of Mr. Forman.
- Yes, sir!
- Way to go, Dad!
Damn dog.
And Mr. Forman, even though this hearing did go your way today in light of some of your son's responses I would strongly encourage you to go to anger management classes.
Sure, I'll- I'll do that.
Neat!
Anger management- That sounds like it could be kind of fun, right?
We-We won.
Hey!
You and me- We're such a good team.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah.
We did it.
How about us, huh?
Stickin' it to the man.
I'll see you at home.
Wait.
But, Dad, we- we drove here together.
Then she fell asleep, and I stroke her hair.
You did the right thing, Fez, but a word of advice.
Next time you tell the story, ya nailed her.
Yeah, but, you know, it's better you didn't 'cause scammin' on another guy's woman- That's totally breaking the code.
Donna told me what you did, you dill-hole!
No, she's lying!
Oh!
That's my nipple!
Hello buttercup.
Fez, you're drunk.
Madam, I may be drunk, but you should have sex with me.
That's crazy.
But you have to, because last night I made a big mistake.
I don't even remember last night.
Ay!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Kelso, what's with the gym shorts?
Oh, something happened.
I had to take my pants off.
Do you shave your legs?
No.
It's- They're just naturally smooth.
Shut up!
Not to worry, Kelso.
The Puberty Bunny will visit you soon.
So, lab partner I guess you and I are gonna be spending a lot of time together now, huh?
Yeah, Shelly.
And, uh, good thing too 'cause, you know, I just shouldn't be alone around a Bunsen burner.
That is so funny!
Let me go tell my friends you're driving me home.
Looks like Shelly has a thing for Forman.
Yes, and Forman has a thing for Shelly.
And it's in his pants.
Oh, good one, Fez.
Watch.
Shelly's gonna invite you over to her house when her folks aren't home.
That's what slutty girls do.
So, Eric, my parents aren't home.
Let's go to my house.
-  - Huh.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Yeah.
That's what's great about it.
See, maybe Donna will get jealous and her and Shelly will wrestle over you.
- Kelso, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
- Oh, yeah?
Think about it.
- He's mine!
- No, he's mine!
- I had him first!
- You're going down!
Kelso, that's the smartest thing I've ever heard.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
I mean, it's just sitting there all empty.
No, come on, this place was made-  This- this place was made for studying!
Well, okay.
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Shelly, look.
It's my girlfriend, Donna.
Hi, girlfriend Donna.
Hi, Donna.
You know, Eric, we'll do this later, when we can be alone.
To study.
We were just studying.
- Eric, you got to hear this- - We were just studying, Donna, that's all.
Eric, I'm telling a story here.
Kelso was running through the cafeteria and there were these mashed potatoes on the floor- She's just my lab partner!
So, mellow out!
God!
Uh-huh.
So, Kelso slips on the potatoes slides into a pole with his legs spread, totally wracks himself.
And everybody starts throwing their carrots and their cheese at him chanting- "Tater nuts!
Tater nuts"!
It was awesome!
So, wait.
Even though I'm spending time with Shelly, you're not jealous?
I'm sorry, but you and Shelly?
- What does that mean?
- It means that she can have anyone.
And what does that mean?
- Oh, you're sweet.
- Get off of me!
Well, there's the little patient.
So, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well, let me put it this way.
If a horse is in good shape, they say it's healthy as me.
Uh-huh.
And did they say something about your pants being on fire, liar, liar?
- No.
- I just got off the phone with Dr. Leggett.
He said your blood pressure is through the roof.
Well, Kitty, who are you gonna believe?
Some quack doctor or the man who stood by you while you delivered our children?
Oh, you did not.
You went out for a sub.
Red, from now on, I am going to make sure you eat right.
No meat, no cheese and no beer.
No beer?
You- Ohh!
Oh, that's it, Kitty.
Ohh!
You've killed me.
I see the light.
What's that, Lord?
It's okay to eat meat and beer and cheese?
Okay, I'll- I'll tell her.
What that's, Lord?
Dry toast and oatmeal.
Will do.
Man, Donna saw Shelly practically living in my lap.
How could she not be jealous?
I'm hot.
It's because you are decent, good-hearted and pure.
You know, a sissy.
Forman, I think what we need here is some input from Tater Nuts.
Tater Nuts, what do you think, Tater Nuts?
Eric, this- Hey, stop calling me Tater Nuts!
If Donna's not jealous, I mean, it means, basically, you're in the free and clear.
She's giving you the okay to cheat.
You gotta cheat!
Hmm.
Tater Nuts makes sense.
Quit it.
!
I mean, I could be with Shelly right now, if I wanted to.
So, why shouldn't I?
Because then you will have two women when some people have none!
Forget it, Forman.
You're not a cheater.
You know, a wise man once said, "Know thyself".
That man's name was Tater Nuts.
I got to be honest with you, guys.
Okay, l- I do shave my legs.
I just- I just like the way it feels.
No!
Come on now!
Hey, Donna.
Look, we're not gonna be able to hang out tonight.
I've got to go to the library with Shelly.
Okay, that's cool.
We can just hang out tomorrow night.
No, yeah, no.
See, yeah, I'm gonna have my hands full with this Project that's due in a few days so I'll be off alone with Shelly.
She doesn't wear a bra, you know.
Yeah, whatever.
Bye.
Uh-oh.
Farmhand got ahold of the rich lady.
-  - Oh, hi, kids.
Your dad's not really a farmhand.
Yeah.
It's just a little intimacy game we're playing.
- And it's fun!
- Yeah.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
I'm sorry I had to see that.
- Yeah, well, you know, Shelly's waiting for me.
So- - Yeah, Eric, you said that.
Okay, bye.
- He usually gives me a kiss good-bye.
- Yeah.
To be honest?
It kinda grosses me out.
Wait, Jackie, should I be worried that he's spending so much time with Shelly?
Okay, well, normally I'd say yeah, but Eric would never cheat on you.
I mean, all guys cheat.
But I never really thought of Eric as a guy.
Yeah, he's more like a- like a really masculine girl.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, kind of like you.
Mmm!
Lookee, lookee, lookee.
Ribs, corn bread and baked beans.
Come to Papa!
Ow!
Ooh, Papa been slapped.
No, now- now that food is for the kids.
But, here, um, l-I boiled you some skinless chicken.
Ew!
It's gray!
- Laurie!
- I mean, it's gray, yea!
Look, he's already home.
I can't believe I was so suspicious.
He's such a good guy.
I'm gonna write him a note.
A little, "I love you".
You know, Michael once wrote me a sexy note.
Except, he can't really spell, so I didn't know what I was supposed to do to him.
Oh, my God!
Donna, you should not leave your panties in your boyfriend's car.
- I didn't.
- Oh.
Oh!
Oh.
- Is this your card?
- No.
- Is this your card?
- No.
- Is this your card?
- No.
Ah, screw you.
Hey, Kelso, I had a dream about you last night.
- Really?
- Yeah.
We were doing stuff, and it was all hot and sweaty and I just kept calling your name over and over.
"Tater Nuts!
Tater Nuts"!
Then what?
Hey, Laurie, I found something in Eric's car that I think must probably be yours.
Is that- Oh, good heavens, it is.
I am in the presence of panties.
-  - Donna, please.
I don't wear pink panties.
Yeah.
She'd have to wear panties to wear pink panties.
Hyde, did you have a girl in Eric's car?
No.
Oh, but I did have some nachos in there.
And to mess with Forman, I smeared cheese underneath the seat so it'd really stink.
- Did it stink in there?
- Kind of.
- All right!
- Well, then, whose are they?
Hello?
You have not asked me.
Could they not be Fez's panties?
I mean, is that so hard to imagine, Fez in a car with a woman?
- Whose could they be?
-  All right, Donna, here.
I'll figure this out.
I like to think of myself as the Columbo of panties.
Yeah.
I'd say we're looking at a woman.
Ages 16 to 38 with a five-figure income.
She lives within a four-mile radius of here and is very popular with the gentlemen.
Sure, she is.
She'll have sex in a car that stinks like cheese.
So, what you're saying is, they could be Shelly's.
Come on.
Forman wouldn't cheat on Donna.
Sure he would.
Shelly's a tramp.
No man can turn down a tramp.
Well, let's find out.
Laurie, have you ever been turned down?
Nope.
Oh.
Sorry, Donna.
Don't feel sorry for me.
Feel sorry for Eric.
'Cause I'm gonna kill him!
Will somebody please open the door so I can kill Eric?
Hey, there, Red.
Does Mrs. Forman know you're out here clogging your arteries with a double cheese?
Yes.
So there would be no reason to tell her.
Sorry, Red.
I don't think I could lie to Mrs. Forman.
'Cause I really, really love her.
All right, you blackmailing S.O.B., what do you want?
Sure could use some fries.
Here.
Now beat it.
You don't have to be rude.
What if this wasn't even the first time?
What if there have been other girls?
Other panties?
Eric, where did these panties come from?
Uh, gee, I don't know.
But there's nothing in the dresser.
Nothing at all.
Okay, but at least my closet is panty-free.
Donna, you have my word.
Okay, Donna, please, ignore the rope in the middle of the room.
And whatever you do, don't Pull it.
!
Eric, how do you exPlain all this?
Panties!
Glorious panties!
Bastard!
- Hey, there, Donna.
Where are you going?
- To The Hub to kick Eric's ass!
Yeah, well, kick it good.
Jackie, why is Donna gonna beat up Eric?
Donna found another woman's panties in the Vista Cruiser.
-  Oh, no!
- I know, right.
Eric's cheating on her.
Jackie, those panties were mine.
You and Eric?
No!
Me and- Geez, you're dumb.
Now, remember, we can't have the protons and electrons right next to each other because that would just be madness.
Madness, I say!
Oh, Eric Forman, you are just the funniest person I've ever met.
No, I wouldn't go as- Yes.
Yes, I am.
Doesn't your girlfriend mind you spending so much time with me?
Well, no.
Apparently, she's thrilled about it.
Well, she's crazy.
'Cause if I was your girlfriend, I would want to kiss you all the time.
Really?
Whoa!
Hey, come on, lady!
I'm spoken for!
Wow!
Hey, did we miss anything?
What?
God, no.
You didn't miss anything.
All right, people!
Let's back up!
Give 'em some room here!
Hey, Donna, hi, hello.
Don't "Hey, Donna, hi, hello" me.
I trusted you, and you cheated on me with this slut.
- Uh, Donna, I don't- - Excuse me?
Yeah, I said it.
You want some of this?
Come on!
- Donna, hey, whatever you think happened- - I know what happened.
- I found these in your car.
- Panties?
Aha!
So he admits they are panties.
Hey, next time you fool around with someone else's boyfriend why don't you take your panties when you're done?
Those aren't mine.
Mine are white.
And cotton.
With a little pink rose in the front.
So these are some other girl's panties?
Whoa, whoa!
No offense, Donna, but, dude, you're on fire!
You know what, Eric?
I don't need this.
Oh, and by the way, your car smells like cheese.
Donna, look, you have to believe me.
I have no idea whose panties those are.
Donna, those panties are mine.
Eric!
Ohh!
Ohh!
You are a god!
A god, I say!
Um  Mom why were your panties in the Vista Cruiser?
And please be as specific.
Donna, when you've been together as long as your father and I have you need to do creative things in creative places.
- Ew!
- Ohh!
Gads!
Psst.
Daddy, here.
Red, you eating again?
I thought you'd be full after that burger.
- Burger?
- Yeah.
The broccoli burger.
Oh, you are lying!
Well, come on, Kitty.
This isn't food.
This is what food eats.
Well, but it's good for you.
Well, if it's so good, how come I'm the only one that has to eat it?
Good point.
Hey, he's the food sneaker!
- Eat up!
- You wanna mess with me again?
You just come on back.
- Say it again.
- I already said it.
- Come on, one more time.
- You're hot.
- Hot enough to get Shelly?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.
- Hot enough to get any girl I want?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.
Yeah.
That's just good stuff.
You know, Eric, you don't have to rub it in.
I know I made an ass out of myself.
Well, you know what?
That's what you get for taking me for granted.
'Cause, Donna, I may be skinny, but- Yeah, I'm MickJagger skinny and that's very in right now.
Yeah, it's very hot.
Eric, I know you're hot, 'cause you're with me.
Okay.
So, what have we learned from all this?
- Always lock the doors to the Vista Cruiser.
- Right you are.
Man, Bob and Midge must really hate me.
'Cause right after having sex in my car, I think they smeared cheese under the seat.
That's just mean.
There.
Okay, I think it's safe for human occupancy again.
Uh-oh.
Looks like Bob left something in the car too.
Eric, you must sell this car.
Or call a priest.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey.
Check it out.
I got my first story in the school paper.
Neat.
Oh.
They spelled your name wrong.
Apparently you're "Donna Pincipotti".
That's funny 'cause it's got the potty sound in it.
Hey, you know what else is a funny sound?
Where the hell is Jackie with your van, man?
- I want to get out of here.
- Ah, she had to help her aunt move a couch.
Why did you lend Jackie your van?
She hates you, man.
Well, I'm trying to get on her good side, Fez.
I mean, this is a small town with a limited number of women.
And I've already gone all the way through 'em once, and now I'm back toJackie.
Oh.
And I love her.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, how'd it go, baby?
- Oh.
Great.
- Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, except for when I crashed your van.
But other than that, cool.
How did this happen?
Jackie, how?
- Michael, like I said- - How?
- Coming out of the drive- -  How?
Kelso.
Come on, man.
Relax.
Let those of us who aren't you enjoy this moment.
Besides, it's not all that bad.
This door still works.
Hey, Jackie.
What happened to the other door?
Other door?
Yeah, you know, the thing that always got in the way of this giant, gaping hole.
Jackie, what are these?
Uh- Van sticks.
No.
Jackie, these- these are not van sticks.
These are drumsticks.
Whose drumsticks are they?
Oh, wow, Jackie.
What's up?
Okay.
Fine.
You know what?
I used your van to drive Chip and his band to a gig.
Jackie is Chip a girl?
Uh, no.
You had other guys in my van?
You're dating a band?
It wasn't a date.
It was a gig.
Whatever it was, it was a gross misuse of van.
And, uh-And you owe me money- big-time!
I owe you money?
What about all the stuff I bought you while we were together?
That does not count.
You gave me those things so I would love you.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Look what I've got.
Ew.
What's that?
That is Marissa.
Carol's baby.
And you promised me last night that you'd babysit her.
Last night?
But I was drunk.
Why can't you do it?
- Because you promised.
-  - And besides- -  Your father and I are having fondue and Parcheesi at the Pinciottis'.
Oh?
Then I'll do it.
No.
Laurie can watch this baby tonight.
Oh, golly, Laurie, a baby.
And just in time for your Black Mass.
Hey.
What did I tell you about calling your sister the devil?
That it's offensive to the devil?
No, Laurie.
You can't feed a baby bacon.
Okay, okay.
What color is the baby?
Well, good.
Now, if that changes, call me.
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.
We have just got the cutest little baby over at our house right now.
- Isn't she cute, Red?
- Yeah, I just can't get over it.
Geez, Bob.
You got your fingers in the cheese.
Remember how cute Laurie and Eric were when they were babies?
They used to just laugh and play.
Well, every time I was around all they did was scream.
I just think it would be nice to have a baby around the house again.
Oh, damn it, Bob.
Get your fingers out of the cheese.
Do you think it would still do this if I stopped feeding it?
- Oh, Laurie, let me do that.
-   Wow.
How'd you do that last move?
It's all in the wrist.
See?
Hey.
- Look at the wrist on my girl.
- Shut up.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait, no.
Donna, wait.
I think it really likes you.
Ooh.
I think it just said your name.
Donna!
Hey, you know, you were really good in there.
Well, it's not exactly brain surgery.
I know, but it was so cool.
It's just- I think it's really, really cool that you can do that.
Eric, you're, like, over the moon 'cause I changed a poopy diaper, but when I got my story in the school paper all you said was, "Yeah, they called you Donna Pincipotti".
It's a funny sound.
"Potti".
Come on.
Try not to laugh.
That's good.
Come on, Donna.
About the diaper thing- I was just paying you a compliment.
- What was the compliment?
- That you are gonna be so great staying home with our kids.
What?
Eric, how exactly do you see our future?
Okay, okay.
That could work.
I would just like to adjust one little thing.
Okay.
The businesswoman idea is good.
But what about this?
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I would just change one thing.
That seems more hurtful than sexy.
Jackass.
So does that.
- You owe me money.
- Michael, your uncle gave you that van for free.
Yeah?
Well, I put a lot of money into that van.
The shag carpeting uh, eight track strobe light, black light, red light.
- I hate you.
- Well, I hate you more.
- I hate you most.
- Well, I hate you the- Damn it!
All right.
All right.
Let's just act like adults and treat this like what it really is: A divorce.
Oh, Jackie, you get custody of me.
All right.
Let's just figure out what you guys owe each other.
Fine.
I'm not afraid.
I'm right, and he's a total moocher.
I'm not afraid either.
There are laws to protect a man and his van.
For instance, the Man-Van Act of 1847.
Right.
All right.
All right.
Jackie in your opinion, what are the goods and services that Kelso owes you for?
Everything.
He was a total doofus before I met him.
In fact, I bought you that belt.
So hand it over.
And the shirt too.
Fine.
You know, this shirt has bad memories of you buying me stuff anyway.
Here.
Let me do the math.
Okay.
Now, Kelso- Uh, Kelso owes Jackie the price for breaking her beautiful heart and stealing her innocence.
Now, Kelso, what do you believe Jackie owes you?
Well- Uh- W- One time I told her that she looked pretty when really she looked pretty skanky.
And- And- Hyde, help me out here.
Okay.
Let me think.
Oh.
Don't forget he burned your house.
- Hyde.
- Dude, you burned her house.
Oh, and that clean baby smell.
Yes, but when we had babies we couldn't go to the movies or out to dinner.
Oh, Red.
When was the last time we went to the movies or out to dinner?
Exactly.
Who needs to leave the house when there are no babies in it?
I gotta thank my lucky stars I got the old snippety-snip.
Bob, you mean you just let some quack remove- On, no.
Nothing's removed.
Okay.
That's enough of that.
Yeah, well, I guess it's okay if it means you don't have to have any more babies.
Oh, Red, it was fun having babies.
Remember fun?
Yes, Kitty, but it was also a large responsibility.
Or burden, if you will.
Red Forman, I don't want to hear another word out of you unless it's "I love babies".
- Kitty, you're making a scene.
- That is not "I love babies".
Kitty, what's the matter with you?
Oh, well, l- I don't- I don't want to ruin our nice night out because, boy, Midge, you can really melt a super pot of cheese, but, um- I think I want another baby.
Really?
You like my cheese?
This is Aqua Net.
The same stuff Farrah uses.
And she's got a big TV show, and she's married to Lee Majors.
So, Aqua Net, very important.
Oh, come on, Red.
Oh, look how sweet this baby is.
Just hold it.
Look, Kitty.
I didn't touch our kids when they were babies, and I'm not touching this one.
- Red Forman, you touch this baby.
- Nope.
- Touch it.
- Not happening.
Is this child wearing lip liner?
So, turns out my supersensitive guy boyfriend wants me to be a baby machine.
What a dill-hole.
Donna, I'm sitting right here.
That's why I said it, you dill-hole.
Donna, the only reason I thought you'd stay home with the babies is because only every woman has done it for the entire history of time.
So, don't be mad at me.
Be mad at your foremothers.
Yeah.
That is so typical.
As if every woman wants to spend her life as a pampered housewife raising kids and organizing the help.
Wait.
Isn't that what every woman wants?
Donna, man Forman's just limited by his experiences.
As the voice of a new generation of smart, independent women you need to make this dill-hole realize that a mind and spirit like yours has more options than your mothers had.
Yeah.
Sorry.
What?
All right, Donna.
So are we cool?
I'm not wrong.
Women take care of babies.
- They do.
- Listen to him, Marissa.
He whines like a girl, but he's not a girl.
Or maybe he is.
The thing is, Donna's really good at it.
I mean, I could understand you not wanting to stay home with your children.
You already have such a fulfilling career as a whore.
Listen, twerp.
Did you ever think maybe it's not that she doesn't want to have babies?
Maybe she just doesn't want to have your skinny, whiny girl-trapped-in-a-boy-body babies.
Okay.
That's one for you.
I'm cold.
That must be why your nipples are so pointy.
Oh, pointy nipple man is mad.
I hope he doesn't poke me with his pointy nipples.
All right.
That was really disturbing.
Okay.
Here we go.
According to my calculations, for repairs to the van Jackie, you owe Kelso $65.
Aha!
Justice!
Yeah.
And, Kelso, you oweJackie $8,265.
Pay up, moocher!
Wha-Wha- No, no.
This is- That's totally unfair!
Hyde, you suck.
You could have been a man and forgiven her.
But no.
You wanted to do the math.
Man, math has never been my friend.
Wait.
No.
But she had other guys in my van.
Michael, you had other girls in your van while we were dating.
So, give me my $8,000.
Okay.
I change my mind.
I forgive you.
See, if we had a baby right now we could be giving it a bath.
We could be putting it in its warm little jammies.
Yeah.
It's a shame that we have to crawl into bed for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep instead.
Come on.
You don't really want another baby.
Well, I don't know.
I only have a few years left where I even have the option.
Well, just because you can have a baby doesn't mean you should.
I have a snowblower, but I don't use it in July.
Red, it just- It feels like maybe we've done everything important there is to do.
We saved up.
We got our house.
We had our kids.
Now what's left to look forward to?
Peace and quiet.
Well I just can't believe we're never gonna hear that sound in our house again.
Well, until we have grandchildren.
Grandchildren!
Oh, I forgot about grandchildren!
-  - So did I.  Oh, boy.
I like the looks of that.
My baby with a baby.
It's not that hard.
I heard her crying, and I figured she needed a bottle and it turned out that she did.
So, um you think you might want a baby of your own?
Well, yeah.
I mean, once my looks start to go, why not?
All right.
So, how many kids are we talking here?
One?
Two?
Six?
Whoa, Mom.
Ease up, okay?
I'm not even down to one boyfriend yet.
But- But you will be soon, right?
Well, Zeke gets out of jail in three months.
Okay.
Uh, I'm- I'm- I'm gonna go talk to Eric.
Mom are you happy?
Sure.
What's this about?
I don't know.
It's, like Eric said this stupid thing about me not working when we're married and I just want to do something more meaningful with my life than have kids, you know?
- No offense.
- No.
No.
That's okay.
It's not like I never wondered what my life could have been like if I hadn't married your father.
I mean, l- Well, I could have been a doctor.
- Exactly.
- Or a dancing girl.
Right.
Oh, honey.
Don't worry so much about what Eric said.
You're probably not even gonna have to deal with this anyway.
- How do you figure that?
- Well, you and Eric are so young.
The chances are you're not gonna end up together anyway.
All right, Donna.
That's it.
We gotta figure this out.
Because this is just hanging over our heads like one of those huge, awful hanging things.
Let's not worry about this anymore.
Let's, uh- Let's go for a drive, okay?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Did you want to say something else?
No.
Just I love you.
Oh.
- Enough to strip for me?
- All right.
No.
I mean I love you too.
I'd strip for you.
Laurie, her mother is waiting.
I don't care.
I love her, and I'm not giving her back!
- What are you doing with that?
- Give me back the baby, missy, or, so help me the dryer goes down.
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
Fine, fine.
Take her.
Shh, baby.
You're okay now.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Happy Veteran's Day.
Now where have you hidden the chocolate eggs?
Uh, they're everywhere, Fez.
Start looking.
So, Steven.
Isn't Veteran's Day romantic?
Oh, yeah.
Government pawns and missing limbs.
That's amore.
I know, I know.
It's a day for people in love to have fun together.
You know what?
All this talk about having fun makes me want to have fun.
Hey, let's throw stuff at other stuff.
Man, that's perfect.
I've got stuff.
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.
So, Steven.
Would you like to go to Mr. Forman's barbecue with me?
No.
- As a matter of fact, I don't want to go anywhere with you.
- You know, that's okay.
You know what?
We can stay in.
No, Jackie.
Look, I told you, again and again I have no interest in you, and you don't have a chance.
And yet, you keep thinking that I have interest in you, and you have a chance.
Wait, did you just say that you're interested in me and that I have a chance?
Okay.
You know what?
You've forced me to do this.
I'm gonna explain my feelings to you through a highly disciplined form ofJapanese poetry haiku.
My heart aches with pain.
When I see you, I vomit.
Die away from me.
Ouch.
Sayonara.
Donna, never have 17 syllables hurt me so much.
Why would he want to hurt me like that?
Because you're stalking him, Jackie.
- No, really, Donna.
- Jackie, really.
You are to Hyde what Fez is to you.
That's ridiculous.
Fez and I will never happen.
Oh, God.
Steven and I will never happen.
Jackie, it's all right.
You just gotta get over this and be strong.
You're right, Donna.
You're right.
Oh, how I wish my daddy could buy him for me.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
This smell like chocolate to you?
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Look.
I'm Paul Stanley from KISS.
Kelso, don't play with the cheese.
These damn kids.
They don't respect anything American.
Oh, Red, this isn't about the kids misusing dairy products.
You're still upset that Bob marched in the Veteran's Day parade.
Well, he was only in the National Guard.
It's called Veteran's Day not Pansy-ass, National Guard Wussy, Pansy-ass Day.
Oh, come on, Red.
Are any dirty Commies less dead because of him?
No, I guess not.
You're right, Kitty.
You know, I'm gonna put away this uniform, and then we'll fire up that grill.
Hey, Red.
Some parade, huh?
Yeah, sure was, till the National Guard got there.
Look, I just came over to invite you to my barbecue.
Your barbecue?
Bob, I have an annual barbecue every Veteran's Day.
It's my day because I'm a veteran.
Well, I'm a veteran too.
And I'm having a barbecue, and you can't stop me.
Hey, Mr. Pinciotti, I didn't know you were in the Boy Scouts.
Ah.
Hey, everybody.
This is Chip.
He's been after me for a while now, so I just said, "What the hell"?
- Chip, it's everybody.
- Hey, everybody.
Jackie, I'll, uh, get you something to drink.
Whatever.
So you're with this Chip guy now?
- Yep.
- Huh.
Why?
Do you care?
No, I mean, if you want to date this guy, that's cool.
It is?
And then Steven said, "That's cool".
But not like "cool".
More like he's jealous.
Jackie, or he just thinks it's cool.
Donna, it is so romantic.
Just like West Side Story.
Yeah, but without the dancing and the Puerto Ricans.
Wait.
Is Fez Puerto Rican?
You know what?
I don't know.
Huh.
This will show Red.
We're gonna have the best barbecue ever.
If there's one thing you learn in the National Guard, it's how to cook.
Oh, I'm gonna defrost some chicken.
Mom, the Formans have a barbecue every Veteran's Day.
- I mean, why are we having one?
- Honey, this isn't about a barbecue.
This is about your father going bankrupt.
- Now help me with these chairs.
- What?
What are you talking about?
We need the chairs for people to sit on.
No, Mom.
About Dad being bankrupt.
Your dad's appliance store's going out of business 'cause he can't compete with Price Mart.
So he decided to throw a big barbecue.
Okay, I'm still not getting this.
Oh, your dad wants to be big shot one last time before everybody discovers what a failure he is.
- Oh, my God.
- And please don't tell anybody.
He's very sensitive about being a failure.
Here you go.
Enjoy your burger.
And thank you for choosing the Formans for your Veteran's Day celebration needs.
Kitty, why is everybody over at Bob's?
They've got chicken.
Chicken?
Well, isn't that a surprise?
A National Guardsman serving up chicken.
He's not gonna get away with this.
Eric, chop up some onions and mix it in with the meat.
Why can't we just put the onions on top of the burger?
Eric, do you want to win this thing or don't you?
Okay, not-crazy Dad.
- Eric, can I talk to you?
- Uh, not really, Donna.
I got to bust hump.
- My dad wants to crush your dad's barbecue.
- What?
Why?
Well, apparently, my dad believes that if your dad's barbecue is better than his America will fall to the Russkies.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe my dad's barbecue is really important to him?
Uh, no.
Because it's just a stupid barbecue.
It's not stupid.
I'm so sick of your dad.
He's such a jerk.
Whoa.
My dad's a jerk?
Well, Donna, your dad's a jerk, and he's just copying my dad.
And your dad didn't even fight in the war.
You're just a National Guard kid.
Yeah, I said it.
What?
What?
Oh, yeah?
Well, you and Red are going down.
And you know what else?
I was wrong, Eric.
Red's not a jerk.
He's an ass, and you're an ass.
'Cause the ass doesn't fall far from the ass tree.
"What did I say, what"?
Man, I can't believeJackie chose that guy over me.
- Or me for that matter.
- Yeah, that's true.
'Cause you're a good-looking guy.
Back at you, Kelso.
Your eyelashes, they go for, like, miles.
I've heard that.
Yeah.
I'm what's known as "man-pretty".
Bad news, Dad.
The Pinciottis have these.
Red, white and blue napkins?
That clever S.O.B. And I cheaped out and went for the plain white.
So what, now we surrender?
Surrender?
You know, if this were an actual war, you'd be the first in a body bag.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna go refill the ketchups.
Schlitz.
Hey, Jackie.
Who's that hot guy you brought with you?
Back off!
I need him for right now but you can have him when I'm done, as usual.
Wait a second, Jackie.
Are you working an angle here?
Nice.
No, there's no angle.
I just want to see if I can make Steven jealous.
So you're gonna sleep with him a couple of times and see what happens.
- Yeah, I've been down that road.
- No!
Oh, you're such a child.
Send him to my room when you're done.
- So, you and Jackie, huh?
- Yeah, isn't she something?
- Sure.
- Sometimes, though, I kind of hate it when she talks.
I hear you.
And she's always talking.
But, I figure it's worth it if I can nail her.
Huh.
Yeah, you should probably think about that, man.
You know, I mean, Jackie's kind of young.
- She only had, like, one boyfriend, so- - Hey, that's not a big surprise.
You know, she's a bitch.
Oh, no.
- Steven, what happened?
- What?
Nothing.
Just somebody-And then the guy said "bitch," and there's nothing.
Oh, my God.
He called me a bitch?
And you hit him.
And that's what happened, isn't it?
No.
Liar.
I am the bitch, and you love me.
Stop staring at me.
Quit it.
I'm not this guy.
Oh, God.
Oh, Steven, I saw what happened.
Is your girlfriend okay?
My girlfriend?
Yeah, the-the bossy, little, mean one you're always hanging around with.
- Oh, uh, Jackie.
- She's not my girlfriend.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I don't like her.
She's shallow and rich and mean and bossy.
- She's everything that I hate.
- But, Steven, you hate everything.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, it means that maybe you like her 'cause I kind of think you do.
No.
How could I like her?
Because I don't like her.
Because I can't like her.
Mrs. Forman, if I like her, shoot me.
Pow!
Jackie, get your car.
We're going on a freakin' date.
Oh, my God.
It's a Veteran's Day miracle.
Red, white and blue cheeseburgers.
Eric, you're a genius.
Voilà.
Sparkler dogs.
God bless America.
- Freshly squeezed.
- That's fresh.
Ah, beer in the bottle.
That's class.
- The keg is tapped.
- Bend over and kiss it good-bye, Bob.
Here comes the big one.
A keg?
Oh, great.
Red's gone nuclear.
- This barbecue is over.
-  Dad, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?
We had sparkler dogs.
We could win this thing.
No.
Donna, thanks.
But it's over.
I just wanted one big blowout.
One last hurrah, you know?
Oh, why didn't I rent the one-man band?
This is the best date ever.
Jackie, we haven't talked in 30 minutes.
That's okay.
Steven, you don't have to say anything.
I understand you.
-  Oh, you do, do you?
- Sure.
Okay, so you're probably sitting there thinking "I'm on this date with this girl "who really, really likes me.
And she's so beautiful".
- Jackie.
- Hush.
And you're wondering "How can I open up to her "when everyone I have ever loved have abandoned me?
Am I even worthy of love"?
Well, you are, Steven.
You are.
It's okay, Steven.
It's okay.
Know what?
Let it out.
- Let it all out.
-  Okay.
It's okay.
- Let's go home.
- Oh, come on.
I'm kidding.
No, this is all right.
We can hang out here for a while, okay?
God.
Here, have some of my pop.
Sure.
Okay.
- Well, we've gone through three batches of ambrosia salad.
- Three batches!
Not since D-day has there been such a complete and glorious victory.
Oh, hi, Donna.
Well, I hope you're all happy.
'Cause you ruined my dad's barbecue.
All he wanted was one more good day before everybody found out that his store was closing, and he's going bankrupt.
- Wait.
What?
- Yeah.
Bargain Bob's is closing this week so congratulations.
Oh, my God.
I feel so bad.
Well, you should.
You ruined his barbecue.
Why would you do that?
What?
Me?
You were- Eric, for God's sakes, the man is almost a veteran.
Okay, fine.
You know what?
Fine.
It's all my fault.
But, Dad, you, you gotta make everyone here go next door.
Eric, you're right.
We have got to go over there.
They are our neighbors.
They are our best friends.
Yeah, I suppose.
All right, freeloaders.
Let's move it on over to Bob's.
- Eric, grab that keg.
- Okay, I'm on it.
Hey, what's everybody doing here?
Congratulations, Bob, you really out-barbecued me.
I gotta say.
You're one hell of a guy.
Oh, Bob.
We just love you so much.
- Midge, you told.
-  Look, Bob.
I just want you to know that you've been a real good neighbor and a real good friend.
And if you ever need it, I'm here for you.
Thanks, Red.
Oh, but, uh I can't help you if you cry, Bob.
- Don't cry.
- These are tears of joy, Red.
Yeah, that's bad too, Bob.
Move!
Come on.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
What's up?
Hi.
Look, I'm sorry.
Everyone came by, and I know you did that so thanks.
No, Donna.
I'm sorry.
Look, you know that I wouldn't have acted like such a jerk if I knew something so terrible was happening to your dad.
No, I know.
I know.
It's okay.
- My folks didn't want me to say anything, so.
- Yeah.
No, I mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah, and no.
I don't know.
So our first date's almost over.
Yeah.
What'd you think?
It was no worse than bowling.
L- I don't hate bowling.
-  - Huh.
Okay.
I didn't feel anything.
- Nothing?
- No, I mean, the kiss was hot, but- Well, did you feel something?
Uh, no.
Well, no.
So I guess that's it then.
Turns out you were right about us all along.
Yeah.
So what happens now?
I'm not opposed to doing it.
Take me home, you pig.
Yes, dear.
Fez.
I don't feel so good.
Me neither.
You see a horse?
- Yes, I do.
- Is it pink?
Uh-huh.
This was the best barbecue ever.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
All right, Hyde!
Your dad's apartment is the perfect place for a party.
- It's already trashed.
-  Hey, even if half the people we invited show up, this party's gonna rock.
- Did you find the cups?
- Nope.
Even better.
A plastic tube and a funnel.
All this and a dirty funnel?
Merry Christmas to me.
Yeah, we don't even have to worry about germs because even though our spit backs up in the tube the alcohol kills 'em.
- We're leaving.
- So leaving.
- Wait.
You're leaving?
- Yeah, see when I was a little girl, I made a promise to myself.
"Self," I said, "if you're ever about to suck beer out of a funnel that might give you mono, don't".
So bye-bye.
All right.
Kelso, I'm gonna nix the funnel on account of I think it repels women.
Hey, any woman who doesn't appreciate a nice funnel isn't much of a woman.
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey.
- What's with the keg?
- Throwin' a little party.
You know, 'tis the season to get sloppy.
- Well, uh- - You're cool with this, right?
Sure.
Yeah.
Cool dad.
That's me.
-  - Totally cool dad.
Hey, listen.
Have a merry, uh, keg party.
-  - Mr. Hyde, you're the best.
Yeah, you're the best.
Will you be my daddy?
I'm not kidding.
Seriously.
- Oh, hey, Fez, can you grab this for me?
- Sure.
You know, Kelso, four times is not funny.
Um, yes, it is.
-  -  Guess who?
- Eric, it's your mom!
-  - Oh, I'm not- -  Oh, you're caroling.
That is so odd.
Well, um, happy holidays.
Look what I brought.
Mistletoe!
-  - Uh-oh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Now, Steven, I brought some beautiful Christmas ornaments to hang on your antenna.
Ah, Mrs. Forman, you're not checking up on me, are you?
No, no, no.
I'm just spreading a little holiday cheer.
Dusty.
Oh.
Oh, and this blanket, it needs a nice Christmas washing.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
That's Bud's Christmas stool.
Very sentimental.
If anybody touches it, he just goes nuts, so- Huh.
Well, um, I don't quite believe you, but okay.
Okay.
So, um, Bud left you boys here unsupervised?
Oh, salami in the couch.
Now, that's sanitary.
Okay!
Okay, then, um, why don't you boys hang up those angels?
And, um, Eric, come in here and help me with the traditional holiday floor wax.
Mom, seriously, we're okay.
You can go, really.
Oh, good.
Fez is making ice.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Ooh.
Listen to this.
"Corner Him Under the Mistletoe: Eight Ways to Trick a Guy Into a Relationship".
I love the holidays.
Yeah, hanging your stocking, putting cookies out for Santa, setting a man trap.
Mmm, Christmas.
You know, this'll be the first year I celebrate Christmas without a boyfriend.
And Jesus wept.
So here's my new plan for the year: Buy some really cute tops, fly to Hollywood and marry Lee Majors.
Make fun of that.
I dare you.
Jackie, there are so many ways to make fun of that I don't even know where to start.
It's like choosing your favorite jelly bean.
Donna, be nice to me.
I'm lonely.
I mean, okay, if there were mistletoe over me right now who would kiss me?
No one.
That's who.
Being alone isn't that bad.
It's a great opportunity to get to know yourself and be comfortable with who you are.
Donna, I already love myself.
I just wanna French someone.
I miss my funnel.
-  - Eric, drink.
Okay.
If I was Tattoo, and I lived on Fantasy Island my fantasy would be to not be a midget.
Am I right?
-  - Hmm.
Eenie, meenie, miney, Forman.
You know, Hyde, at first I thought your dad was a real dirtbag but I've come to realize that there's a fine line between dirtbag and Father of the Year!
-  - Damn!
Fellas, I have to be honest.
I've never played quarters before, so I probably stink.
-  - Oh, happy day!
Eric.
Man, this is the worst game in the world.
- I'm so thirsty.
-  Damn it!
Eric, drink!
I mean, he lives on Fantasy Island, man and he's a midget!
It's so obvious.
-  -  Hmm.
Mmmm, Forman.
Does anyone else feel kind of woozy?
-  - Oh, what the hell, man?
If I make this shot, I promise I will not pick you, Eric.
I pick you, Eric.
It's fun to lie.
Donna, that's Fireman Rob and Fireman Dean.
- They're firemen!
- Jackie, they're, like, 40.
Whatever.
They're firemen!
Two hot firemen in a bar.
This is just like that play I wrote.
Okay, give me five minutes.
I'll pick the one I want, and you can have the other.
Hello!
I'm dating someone.
Eric.
Donna, Dean can bench-press a keg.
- Eric can't even bench-press a cup.
- He can too.
Rob, Dean, this is Donna.
-  - So, what do you girls do?
That's funny you should ask.
We, uh, go to high school!
- Any outside interests?
- Uh-huh.
High school guys!
Kelso, it's fine.
I'm not that drunk.
I just-  I just can't walk or see.
Man, that was- That was a great party!
You know-You know who doesn't like parties?
Red.
"I'm Red!
I don't like parties 'cause I'm a big, bald, party pooper"!
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Son of a bitch!
Eric, when did you eat spaghetti?
I knew something was going on at Bud's.
When I went over there, the only thing in the fridge- olives.
And poor Fez had ice in his pants.
My head hurts.
That's your brain trying to comprehend its own stupidity.
I mean, what kind of parent leaves a bunch of teenagers alone with a keg?
A fun one?
Hey, Jim Beam, can it.
Red, you need to have a talk with Bud.
No.
Eric's home now.
And what goes on between Bud and Steven is between Bud and Steven.
He's just not a good dad.
Well, you know what?
I agree.
So, I think we should get in the car pick up Steven and move him back in with us and feed him and- and clothe him and love him.
No.
I'm not loving anybody that I'm not legally required to.
Fine.
I'll call Bud.
And, Eric, I'll deal with you later.
Thank you.
Mommy, I don't feel so good.
If you're gonna get sick again, why don't you throw up under the tree because Christmas is ruined!
Oh, no.
So, tell me more about the big ladder thingy.
Oh, the cherry picker?
Funny story.
True story.
Okay, Jackie, this is a nightmare, and we're leaving.
Okay.
Look, Donna, you have a boyfriend, I don't.
And maybe I don't want to sit home alone every night.
And if somebody doesn't tell me I'm cute in the next five minutes, I'm gonna scream!
Hi.
Sorry.
My friend was being a wet blanket.
Well, maybe I should talk to her.
I mean, a wet blanket's a fireman's best friend.
Boy, something about you is so familiar.
I get that all the time.
See from the right, I look like Gidget and from the left, I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
- Neat, huh?
- Nah.
It's- Oh, it's your laugh!
You know, I used to date a girl with the same laugh, but, uh, it was 20 years ago.
She dumped me and married some rich lawyer.
Burk- Burkhart!
That was it.
Oh, my God, that's my name!
And my dad's a rich lawyer!
Oh, my God!
So, Jackie, was this in the play you wrote?
Kitty, why are you smoking?
It's my Yuletide cigarette.
To celebrate all the children who spend black Christmases with bad parents.
Kitty, put that out.
- Back off, Grinch.
-  Hey, Red.
Hey, Kitty.
Bad parent.
- Is she all right?
- Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, sit down, Bud.
Kitty, sweetheart why don't you leave us alone for a minute?
A boy can't live on olives.
Bud- Eric just came back from your place falling-down drunk.
He threw up on my shoes.
Now, what were you thinking, leaving kids alone with a keg?
Look, Red, I've never really been a dad before.
L-I'm just trying to- I don't know- take it easy, be his friend.
Why would you be friends with a 17-year-old?
They're idiots.
Bud, being a teenager is like being in combat.
One minute you're crawling around half blind- the next, you're looking for your own foot.
- Follow me?
- Not really.
I was a conscientious Canadian.
Well, if you weren't chicken and you did fight who would you want as your lieutenant, me or you?
Well, you, 'cause you're mean and scary.
That's right.
Steven doesn't need another friend, Bud.
Steven needs somebody to ride his ass.
He may not like it.
He may not thank you for it.
He may do impressions of you behind your back.
He thinks he's so damn funny.
But the point is, he'll know right from wrong because you did your job.
Huh.
Bread, ham, bananas, milk.
Because there are four food groups, Bud!
Four!
-  -  I am so grossed out.
I need a Calgon bath, a facial, some Tater Tots and someJean Naté.
- This night was the worst.
- I know.
I mean, I am not gonna find love in a bar.
All I'm gonna find there are guys who used to French my mom.
Just this morning, I was playing with My Pretty Ponies.
Look what you've done to me!
Look!
Me?
I'm not the one who hooked up with the volunteer fire department.
I am never gonna meet anybody and I'm never, ever gonna feel better, ever.
Jackie, when you're sad, you look exactly like Mary Tyler Moore.
Oh, my God!
Donna, I do.
I am gonna make it after all!
Damn!
Okay, everybody, here we go.
Now, if I catch on fire, you promise to put me out?
Well, I'm sure someone will.
Right, guys?
Okay, great.
Steven, I gotta tal- - What the hell are you doing?
- It is complicated.
All right.
That's it.
Party's over.
Everybody out.
What the hell are you doing, Bud?
Steven, this place is a madhouse.
There are kids all over the place, and this guy could've burst into flames.
We'll never know now, will we, Bud?
Look, Eric went home so drunk, he threw up all over Red's shoes.
- That's good stuff.
- No, it's not good stuff.
And you know what else?
It's forbidden.
So, what, are you trying to play father now?
I'm not playing.
I am your father.
You wanna stay here, you're gonna do what I tell you.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really!
I'll be damned if you're gonna end up looking for your own foot on my watch!
Now, clean up all this crap, take the trash out and eat a banana, dumb-ass!
Now he's all strict.
I gotta do my homework and he keeps talking about nutrition.
So, I guess what I'm hearing from all this is Hyde loves his daddy!
- Shut up, Forman.
I do not.
- Yes, you do!
Yes, you do!
- And Daddy loves his little Hyde!
-  And that's why he yells at him and tucks him into bed and puts on his little footsie pajamas and reads him bedtime stories!
Hey, thanks, Steven.
I'll take over from here.
- Now, about last night- - You know what, Dad?
Uh, before you get started, I know what you're gonna say.
Oh, really?
What do you know?
Um, that I was irresponsible and stupid.
And I have it on good authority that I may have called you something.
Like, um, "big, bald party pooper"?
For instance.
But the point is, Dad, I'm really ashamed and sorry and afraid.
Hmm.
Okay.
Well, that covers it.
Okay.
Good talk.
That's it?
I get off scot-free?
I mean, I learned a valuable lesson?
Look, Son, you're grown up now.
You know what you did wrong.
And I am too tired to keep thinking up new and exciting ways to punish you.
So- Merry Christmas.
Are you kidding me?
I don't get in trouble, and you're giving me a Christmas present?
Oh, boy, this is the best Christmas ever!
Actually, you know, this really smells.
Yeah, those are my shoes from last night.
Clean 'em, buff'em and shine 'em.
Ho, ho, ho.
Dumb-ass!
Damn.
Damn it!
Oh, come on!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Well-  Okay.
Now that we're all in the van and you guys can't change your mind I just want you to know that we're not exactly on the way to my uncle's fabulous cabin in the woods.
It's really more of an ice shack.
Did you say ice shack?
Hmm?
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, the hot tub-  It's really more of a garbage can.
Oh, but it's also the bathroom, so- - Kelso, turn this van around!
- No, Donna, wait.
Is there beer?
Tons.
Hey, and we don't even need a refrigerator 'cause it's so freakin' cold.
- Paradise.
- Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, before we pick upJackie I just want to make sure everybody knows what this trip is about.
The fabulous hot-tub toilet?
No.
Eric, tell her about my master plan.
Oh.
Yeah.
See, Kelso, when you start a sentence with the words "master plan," I just kind of know it's gonna be stupid, so I just naturally tune out.
Okay, well, my master plan is- Eric!
Pay attention!
This is about a romantic double date.
It's you and Donna and me and Jackie.
Kelso, you do know you're not actually dating Jackie, right?
That's why it's a secret double date.
See, I told Jackie that the whole gang was coming but then, I didn't invite Hyde, especially not Fez.
He's all overJackie.
Look.
I'm not doing this.
Turn this van around!
No!
I need you guys.
See, if you're there- You guys are, like, the perfect couple.
And-And if you're there then, I can just copy all the sissy, loser things that Eric does for you.
I really do enjoy your sissy, loser things.
Yeah, like when I had first dibs on that seat, but I took the hump.
It's a small price to pay to keep my lady happy.
Exactly.
I want to be that dork.
Hmm.
- Kelso, why are you speeding up?
- I gotta beat this light.
- Why?
- I just- I gotta!
- Damn it!
-   What are you doing?
I've been chasing you for six blocks.
I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't see you.
Yeah, nice try.
I know all about your master plan.
Now, drive, you sneaky son of a bitch.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
You brought me to an outhouse?
Actually, Jackie-  That's the outhouse.
No!
No, it's an ice shack, for fishing.
L-This is gonna be a blast.
I me- It is so beautiful out here.
Plus, I brought lotion.
Ooh, it's kinda cold.
Here, take my jacket.
I love you.
God, we are such the perfect couple.
I'm cold too.
Well, damn, Jackie.
I can't control the weather!
Here, Jackie, take my coat.
Ohh, thanks, Fez.
So, sweetie, what do you want to do?
- Whatever you want to do, honey.
- I want to go inside.
- That's what I want to do too.
- Oh, my God!
Let's go.
Hey, what the hell was that jacket business, man?
Uh, you're making me look bad.
Look, Kelso, you are my good, good friend but I will stop at nothing to win Jackie and if you're in my way, I will destroy you.
This is nice, you coming home for lunch.
Yeah.
Good afternoon, sunshine.
So, what have you got Planned for today?
Same as every day.
Lie on the couch, do my nails, avoid talking to you.
It's not going that well, so far.
Red, that girl does nothing but party all night and sleep all day.
She's gonna end up like Aunt Martha.
Remember the beer gut on her?
She's not gonna end up like Fat Martha.
Poor woman got so large she couldn't play putt-putt.
Geez, don't remind me.
That par two was the longest three hours of my life.
Red, your daughter is drifting.
So what are you gonna do?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna start eating my lunch at the office.
Leo, man, glad you're here.
I've been really busy.
Oh, yeah?
I guess my "buy one, get one free" flyer is really bringing in the business.
That's 'cause you forgot the "buy one" part.
Oh, no.
Well, good thing we're closing early, man 'cause I need you to give me a ride over to my Cousin Larry's.
- I don't have a car, man.
- You can drive mine, man.
- I can't drive since my license got suspended.
- Why?
What'd you do?
Well, I dropped it in some soda, you know?
And it just hung there, suspended.
And then when I was looking at it, I ran a red light.
Boy, ice fishing's fun.
I like this place, out here in the middle of a frozen lake.
It's cozy, don't you think, Jackie?
If by "cozy," you mean "small and smelly," then, yes!
Good one, Jackie.
That's funny.
Well, she needs a sense of humor with an unfaithful ex-boyfriend who brings her to a dump like this.
Ow.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
I mean, Eric would never take Donna to a place like this.
Fez, it wouldn't matter where we were.
- Just being together makes it fun.
- Aw.
But I would never bring you to a place like this because I know that you don't like such small, smelly places.
You know me so well.
Eskimo kiss.
Too bad Kelso doesn't know anything aboutJackie.
Whoa.
That is not true.
I know everything about her.
In fact, I'll bet I know more aboutJackie than Eric knows about Donna.
Whoa, Kelso.
Walk before you run, baby.
You think you know me, Michael?
Then prove it.
Oh, I have an idea.
Let's play The Newlywed Game.
Eric and Donna versus Kelso and Jackie.
And I will be the impartial judge who gets Jackie in the end.
What?
I mean, uh, good- good luck to everyone.
Hey, Leo, what's in the bag, man?
How can I put this?
Let's just say in this bag are illegal drugs.
What?
Come on, man.
You know I'm on probation!
Nah, it's cool, man.
All you have to do is just not get pulled over.
What did I just tell you, man?
Gentlemen, our ladies have already written down the answers to their questions.
First up, Eric.
Eric, what is Donna's favorite Pizza toPPing?
Pepperoni.
-  Donna?
- Pepperoni!
- We're such the perfect couple!
- I know!
Now, Kelso- Mushrooms!
No, no, no, no, no.
That is not your question.
- And minus two for interrupting the host.
- Oh.
- Minus two.
- Okay, sorry.
It's okay.
Minus two.
Now, Kelso, last summer you "accidently" bounced Jackie off a trampoline.
When she woke up in the hospital, what were her first words?
Oh, uh, you- "Michael, you idiot".
Michael, you remembered!
Wow, he remembered.
Okay, Eric, according to Donna what is Donna's last name?
Pinciotti.
-  - Oh, my God!
Yes!
Correct.
Now, Kelso Jackie has distant relatives in the Cook Islands.
In the early 1900s, what species of turtle did they save from extinction?
Take your time.
Ladderback.
-  -  Michael, you're amazing!
Oh.
No, no, no, no.
No hugging!
I'm sorry, all right?
I forgot.
That's right, and let's try to remember that, little lady.
Well, the score is horribly close.
I'm very impressed, Michael.
Yeah, well, I guess you just remember things about those you care about.
Oh, please.
I'm gonna puke.
Let's get this nightmare over with.
Okay, Donna if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?
Um, well, there's stuff I'd change but I know Eric, and he'd say "Nothing".
No, but, wait.
But that's not the question.
Wh-Why?
What'd you answer?
It doesn't matter what I answered, because you answered wrong and I don't- I don't- I don't want to play anymore.
"Huge Wile E. Coyote feet"?
What the hell does that mean?
It means you have enormous feet.
Jackie- Whoa, whoa, Fez.
Eric, you think I have enormous feet?
No.
No, no.
You think that.
Last week, you said you hated your "huge Wile E. Coyote feet".
- Eric, I only said that so you'd say they're not big.
- And they're not big.
I'm sorry, but, dude, that's a lie.
Oh, my God, I don't believe this.
No, Donna, no, you're looking at this all wrong.
Big feet make you, like, really stable.
You know?
Really hard to knock over.
Get bent.
See?
I have small feet.
That's where- Donna?
Are you going somewhere, honey?
Okay, this is it.
For all the marbles.
Jackie.
What was your answer?
Um, hmm well if I had to change one thing about me it would have to be that I'm too cute and all other girls are jealous.
Kelso?
Oh, my God, Michael!
That's amazing!
Oh!
L- Oh, my God, I almost- Oh, my God.
I gotta go talk to Donna.
Who would know that you would win a battle of wits?
Yeah.
Turns out that the key to winning Jackie's heart was in the last place I thought to look my own brain.
Donna, I think I'm actually feeling something for Michael, you know?
Donna, would you please stop looking at your feet and listen to me?
A boyfriend is supposed to tell you the things you don't like about yourself are fine.
Like last week, I told Eric his pecs were getting bigger.
But I mean, come on.
If you lie him on his back, you could fill up his chest with water.
Maybe I'm just lonely.
Or I need a sign from, like, God.
Or, I don't know.
Maybe I just need someone to tell me if I'm crazy.
Jackie, you're crazy.
Not you, Bigfoot.
Hi, honey.
How was- Oh, not over yet.
No, it's not, Red.
Go make Laurie do something with her life.
I mean it.
Now!
Oh.
You know, when a guy comes home from work he just wants to sit down and have a nice quiet beer.
Well, she drank your beer because she doesn't have a future.
Fine, Kitty.
I'm going!
Okay, honey.
First of all always save one beer for Daddy.
Okay.
Second of all we feel that you need to get some direction in your life.
And by "we," I mean your mother.
See, honey.
I'm not really worried.
'Cause I know you're gonna find a nice guy and get married.
- Exactly.
- Right.
Someone who can take care of you, who's rich, who's not Kelso.
And I think this is a plan that might just work out for you.
Okay.
But, Daddy, I mean, if I wanted to have a career of my own, I could, right?
Well, sure.
I just don't want you to set yourself up for- Like what happened at the college- l-lf you set the bar too high, the fall might be- You see, you're just so pretty.
Here's five dollars.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Is there a problem, "ossifer"?
Did you just say "ossifer"?
Uh, no sir, I'm sorry.
I distinctly heard him say officer, sir.
Uh-huh.
I pulled you over because your left brake light is out.
I'm gonna have to write you up a warning.
Close one, man.
I thought for sure he was gonna ask what's in the bag.
I'm still right here.
Uh-oh.
- Dog food?
- We were framed!
I mean-  Of course it's dog food.
What'd you think it was?
Illegal drugs?
All right, weirdos.
Drive safe.
Dog food?
Yeah.
I mean- Oh, wait, man.
If the dog food's in this bag, then where's-  Oh, wow.
I gotta check on my dog, man!
- Jackie, l- - Don't speak, Michael.
I am very close to letting myself experience strong feelings of not hating you.
I just need a sign.
I brought the lotion.
No, okay.
I want you to guess a number between one and ten.
- Seven.
- Guess again.
- Three.
- Close enough.
Let's go.
Jackie, if you go out that door with him whatever we might have had between us is over forever.
Look!
The reason I haven't done anything with my life is because I didn't know what I wanted to do.
Well, the post office has a dental plan that's supposed- Shh!
But, Daddy, you forced me to sit down and think about it and now, I have found my passion!
Hair!
The musical?
No!
Hair!
I'm going to beauty school!
This isn't something you do through the mail, is it?
No!
It's a real school.
- Oh, well, yea!
- Congratulations, sweetheart.
- So, Kitty, what do you think?
- Eh.
Yeah.
Well, looks likeJackie and Kelso are back together.
I won and Fez lost I won and Fez lost  - You guys, what happened?
- I don't know.
The van just started shakin'.
Uh, guys.
Quick!
Everyone give me your belts.
Together we can pull it out.
-  - Come on!
Gi- Michael, this is it!
This is the sign I was looking for!
God doesn't want us to be together!
Who cares?
I'm losing my van!
See?
That was always the problem with us, Michael.
It was always about you.
- Jackie, are you losing your van?
- No!
Then shut up!
Wow, watching Kelso's van sink makes the size of my feet seem unimportant.
See, Donna?
Size doesn't matter.
- Oh, you don't have to tell me.
- That's-Yeah.
That's- There's my sweet girl.
Fez, I'm cold.
Frankly my dear I don't give a rat's ass.
Dr. Zhivago, I'm home.
!
I brought your food.
!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Donna, I'm so glad you're my study partner.
Because you make learning fun.
Okay.
Well, no more study breaks.
We have to get this report done.
All right.
Fine.
Okay.
-  - A report on the current state of U.S. -Soviet relations.
Okay, we need a title.
How 'bout "Current State of U.S. -Soviet Relations"?
Damn, you're smart.
U.S. -Soviet Relations.
You know, Donna, I lost my underwear.
But whatever.
Okay.
Seriously, we need to get some work done.
Donna, I couldn't agree with you more.
Okay.
Right now, with a push of a button the two superpowers could condemn us to painful, fiery deaths.
Fiery deaths.
Okay.
Seriously, we gotta do this thing.
You're right.
Eric, no more study breaks.
Uh, right.
From now on, all business.
The arms race began with the massive buildup of bombers by the Soviet Union.
Actually, the United States started the arms buildup.
No, they didn't.
What about the bomber gap?
Bomber gap?
What?
That's so cute.
Bombers by the United States.
What are you doing?
Study break?
Get bent.
Ow.
!
Oh, there's my underwear.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
- Hey, Donna.
What's wrong?
- Eric, you can't just ignore my ideas.
Oh.
Donna.
You'll get the same "A" I get.
Relax, baby.
Eric, I can't relax 'cause you're wrong, and I'm right.
Okay.
Okay.
I think we need to clear our heads with a nice study break.
Eric, knock it off.
I'm not in the mood for a stupid study break.
What?
Why?
Because I disagree with you?
- It has nothing to do with that.
- Really, Donna?
Because up until now, we were going at it like rabbits who had just gotten out of prison.
Well, that's over.
Wait.
So what are you saying?
You're gonna hold out on me until I agree with you?
Because that's not gonna work, Donna.
First of all, I'm not holding out on you.
And second of all, if I did, it would so work.
Okay, well, you know what?
I think that is what you're doing.
So try this dress on for size!
I'm cutting you off!
Yeah!
- Is that supposed to be a threat?
- Supposed to be.
Yeah.
Okay.
If you wanna do this, we'll do this.
But you're gonna cave, and I'm gonna laugh.
Yeah!
I just saw a U.F.O.!
Oh, my God!
What an unbelievable coincidence.
I was just telling Fez about how dumb you are!
Okay.
No.
So I'm out in the field, right?
And there it was.
It was in the air, and it had lights, and it was, like-   That's a U.F.O., all right.
Hang on, Fez.
Kelso.
Remember that time you thought you saw the Abominable Snowman?
Yeah.
- Do you remember what it turned out to be?
- Just a regular snowman.
Guys, come on.
Let's go out to the field.
It could come back.
You think I got nothing better to do than stand in a field freezing my 'nads off?
Hey, who wants to help me connect the dots?
Sorry, 'nads.
Let's go.
What is all that noise?
Oh, Bob's cutting down a tree in his front yard.
By himself?
Doesn't he know that's incredibly dangerous?
Yeah, but you know what they say about Bob- "He's stupid".
Oh, Red.
Is that any way to talk about a friend?
A stupid friend.
-  -  Timber.
!
Oh, no.
!
Oh, damn it!
Did Bob kill me?
Oh, but he just feels super bad about it.
Mm-hmm.
So, where is everyone?
Boy, you can hardly tell where your head was crushed.
Where are all my friends?
You don't really have any friends, Red.
You know, it's-it's an unfortunate side effect of telling everybody to-to stick it up their butts.
Yeah.
Gee, I guess you're right, Kitty.
Maybe I should have been nicer.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.
You just lie back and enjoy your coffin.
Ooh, satin.
That's nice.
Red!
Red!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
It was an accident.
Bob I never thought I'd say this but I'm glad you're my friend.
Red, I never thought I'd say this but you smell nice.
-  Jackie, that's really annoying.
-  Knock it off, Hyde!
Donna, is there something you need to talk about?
Oh, crap.
Do you need to talk about something?
Can you keep a secret?
-  Not really.
-  Yeah.
Unless I can burn you with it later.
I'm holding out on Eric.
I'm holding out on Donna.
Donna, that's great!
Forman, that's hysterical.
So, how long has it been?
Three of the longest days of my life.
Maybe I should just cave.
No!
If you cave, she owns you.
When he caves, you own him.
Yeah, but there's no way she wants it as bad as I do.
Can you blame her?
I think I want it more than Eric.
Eww.
Why?
Forman, sex is how women control men.
Donna, sex is how we control men.
If they ever find out we want it too we'll never get jewelry again.
Secretly, I believe they like it as much as we do.
Oh.
You and your crazy conspiracies.
Hyde, what are you doing?
This means something.
This is important.
Well, this is a close encounter of the potato kind.
I'm sorry.
How's it going, guys?
Good to see you all.
Kitty, I've been thinking.
It might be fun to have our friends over for a party.
Oh, whoo-hoo!
Party at Red's!
Are you feeling okay, Red?
Oh, honey, honey, don't touch him.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.
Well, I just- I have never heard you use the words "fun," "friends" and "party" all in the same sentence.
I have, Mrs. Forman.
For instance, "Eric, I had fun ruining the party for you and your friends".
Yeah, that was fun.
Well, I think a party is a great idea, Red.
Great.
Then it's settled.
How you doin' there, Sabu?
He smells nice.
- Hello, Donna.
- Hello, Eric.
I have come to work on our report.
- Excellent.
May I take your coat for you?
- Of course.
Holy crap!
She is so sexy.
Be strong.
Fight back.
Use the look.
Oh, no.
Not the look.
It's so-Wait.
I find this hot?
What is wrong with me?
Come on, Pinciotti.
Counterattack.
-  - Oops.
Look away!
Oh, I can't look away.
Must touch.
No!
Be strong.
Well, Donna, if you would refer to page 83-   Oh, the ear!
Damn him!
Wait.
Must win this for womankind.
Must crush Eric.
Red alert.
She is touching your thigh!
Oh, no.
Plan backfiring.
Thigh is so warm, inviting.
Bony, but nice.
Donna, your mother's on the Phone.
Oh, thank God!
- Eric, everything all right?
- Fine.
Shut the door, please.
Hey, dudes.
Leo, what are you doing here, man?
Wow.
That's a really good question, man.
- Leo?
- I'm working on it, man.
- Chocodile?
- What's that?
It's a Twinkie wrapped in chocolate, man.
No, in the sky!
Those lights.
I think that's a U.F.O. It's just a plane.
They're all just planes.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that.
Now I've got photographic evidence.
Of what?
That planes can fly?
I saw a U.F.O. Once, man.
It was awesome.
It just hung in the air.
Then it sent me a message in big, bright yellow letters.
It told me I was gonna have a good year.
Did this, by any chance, happen at a football game?
Yeah, man.
And the weird thing was, I was the only one freaking out about it.
Wait a second.
Good year?
Ah, it was a terrible year, man.
Stupid aliens.
Hey, Red!
I was just telling Tony here how I almost killed you with a tree.
- Ooh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.
- Close call like that can really make you think, huh?
- You bet.
You know, it's like I was upset that you hadn't returned my hedge clippers.
Oh, shoot.
I think I gave those to my brother-in-law.
You did, did you?
Oh, well, that's okay.
It's not like you stole them or anything.
You just took 'em and never returned 'em which is different somehow.
Ha!
It's- Mom, can I ask you a question?
In your relationship with Dad, have you ever let an argument cross into other parts of your relationship?
What do you mean?
You know, I mean, do you ever not have sex with Dad?
Sure!
I'm not having sex with him right now.
No, Mom, I mean, like, in an argument, to get your way.
You can do that?
Yeah.
I just wonder if it's wrong.
Donna, you're saying by my not having sex with your father I can get him to paint the bathroom?
Yeah.
But don't you think it hurts the relationship?
Blah, blah, blah!
I'm getting my bathroom painted!
And two of them to turn the ladder.
Yeah.
Yeah, those Polish people- they sure don't know much about lightbulbs.
Exactly.
Two of them turn the ladder.
So Sammy Davis Jr., the pope and this Polish guy are on a plane, see?
There's only the one parachute.
Hey, Red, seeing as how you're dead and all, can I have those shoes?
Get away from him!
Red, honey, your funeral's a big hit.
You are corpse of the year.
Just put the lid on, Kitty.
I need some freakin' quiet.
- Are you having fun?
- No.
Turns out I was mistaken.
Life is too short to spend it with people who annoy you.
L- I just wanna spend it with people I really, really love.
Like you and, uh- Well, mostly just you.
-  - Everybody.
Thanks for being here.
And I just wanna say when my time comes, I wanna be buried facedown so that anyone who doesn't like me can kiss my ass.
Hey, Kelso, man.
I brought you your film.
U.F.O. Pictures came out okay.
Aha!
Proof.
But these naked ones of you are far more interesting, man.
What?
Those were on that roll?
You know, I don't see a U.F. O but I can definitely see Uranus.
It's a planet, but it's also your butt.
You guys are so immature.
- Kelso, why are you squirting water out of your mouth?
- I was a fountain!
I totally got it, man.
It's art.
Man.
Hey, you guys wanna see the other set he brought?
Ohh!
Donna, we've gotta get this thing done.
This report is due in six hours.
Yeah, Eric.
I've been thinking about it.
This whole Cold War standoff?
It's ridiculous.
Neither side is getting what it wants.
So, what you're saying is by hurting each other, they're actually hurting themselves.
Yeah.
It must be incredibly frustrating for both sides.
Both of them are just building up and building up.
The urge to launch a first strike must be overwhelming and painful.
You know, Donna, in a lot of ways, what we're going through here is just like the Cuban missile crisis except in our case, it's a missile crisis.
Eric, you're right.
It's time for détente.
Wait.
What about our disagreement?
I don't care.
You win, okay?
-  - What?
It's just- I can't believe you caved.
Wait until I tell Hyde.
No.
No!
Where are you going?
Suddenly I'm- I'm not in the mood.
You're lying!
Donna, we're past the point of no return here.
Eric, girls don't have a point of no return.
So see you tomorrow.
- Donna?
- Yes, Eric?
- I cave.
- Oh, thank God, 'cause I was just bluffing.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Where's the tunes, Forman?
- Hang on, you guys.
Just one more wire here.
I learned how to speak English faster than this.
Fez, it's not real English when you speak it with a foreign accent.
Geez.
Aren't these the coolest?
I can't hear you.
I know.
They're the greatest speakers ever.
Eric!
Oh.
Hey, Dad.
Sorry.
Didn't see you there.
Well, I guess that's 'cause you were too busy making an ass of yourself.
Uh, actually I was trying out my new speakers.
What do you think?
New speakers?
What was wrong with the old ones?
Those were genuine G.M. Parts.
Uh-  These are louder.
Well, just keep your monkey music turned down.
Go grab your smock.
We gotta go to work.
Hey, Red.
Is that you?
Oh, cripes.
Hiya, neighbor.
Can't hear ya, Bob.
I'm testin' out Eric's new speakers.
Not bad.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Boy, quite a day at Price Mart, Kitty.
First, the price of lightbulbs dropped two cents then Eric was made employee of the month and to top it off, they added Cheez-Its to the vending machine.
Are you serious?
Yep.
Tiny little squares with the cheese flavor baked right in 'em.
Am I really the Mart employee of the month?
- You sure are.
- Yea!
And they even decided to throw in a extra 25 cents an hour.
Oh, yes.
I gotta admit, Eric.
I had my doubts, but, uh- Hell, you've hardly embarrassed me.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, this is great.
Whoo.
Price Mart rocks.
Oh, Laurie, tell everyone your good news.
I just finished my first two weeks of cosmetology school.
And she didn't flunk out.
Isn't that great?
That is great, honey.
Nice job.
Thanks, Daddy.
Yeah, but the next exam's gonna kill me.
We're not allowed to practice on dummies anymore.
And I have to style a real person's hair.
Oh, honey, you'll do fine.
We're all here to support you.
Great.
So, you don't mind being my model?
Me?
Oh, honey, no, no.
L- I go to the beauty parlor.
Okay, well- Well, maybe Eric can helP out.
Oh, sure.
Laurie, first of all, always run with scissors.
Boy, I never get tired of your sarcasm.
- Really?
-  Sorry.
Red, would you like to be a hair model?
Kitty, I would like to have hair, period.
But I don't, so no.
Oh, forget it.
I don't even know why I picked this stupid career.
Maybe it's because you're stupid?
Laurie, no.
You quit everything.
You are not quitting cosmetology school.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I will be your model.
But you just remember: Men have their cars.
Women have their hair.
It's like a car.
It's valuable.
So, not only are they gonna hang my picture in the front of the store but I also get to represent our entire district in the national Price Mart Olympics.
That's nice.
Do you think I would choke to death if I swallowed my straw?
No, it's got a breathing hole.
- Fez, no!
- Fez, no!
Oh, my God.
There she is.
-  Who's that?
-  The new girl, Caroline.
She transferred here from Sacred Heart.
Or heaven.
I'm not sure which.
We have gym together.
She barely sweats.
Someday, I will make her my bride.
Yep, no one likes a sweaty bride.
- Yeah, I hear you.
- So true.
- Hey.
Why don't you go talk to her, man?
-   You're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
Thank you.
Your cocoa-brown skin makes me hot.
I know.
I am irresistible.
Would you like to dance?
Hey.
Why don't you go talk to her, man?
Oh, I don't know, Hyde.
I can't.
I don't understand this.
Usually I am- I am suave.
I am silky.
But this girl makes me- I have to go to the bathroom.
Anyway, getting back to Price Mart- -  Shut up!
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You guys are never gonna believe this.
- Wait, no.
Me first.
- Okay, go.
Okay.
I, Eric Forman your boyfriend am Price Mart's newest employee of the month.
Eric, that's great.
Are you done?
Well, yeah.
Top that, cupcake.
Okay.
I just won two tickets to the Led Zeppelin concert.
I was caller number seven, and I won, and we're goin' to Zeppelin on Tuesday night.
All right!
She said two tickets, not four, ya moron.
We're not goin'.
Oh, my God, no.
Did you say Tuesday night?
L- I can't go Tuesday night.
It's inventory night.
It's mandatory.
Skip it, Eric.
You love Zeppelin.
Call in sick.
Tell them your grandma died.
Burn down the store.
- You're right.
You know what?
I'm going.
-   I can't go.
- Then who am I gonna take?
- No, Donna- - You shut your filthy mouth!
- Donna, seriously- - I'm practically his brother.
- I've been his friend way longer!
Hey, you know what?
I am going.
Ah, crap.
- Still friends?
- Till death.
I can't go.
- I'm in!
Shut up!
- Get killed!
Uh- Eric, are you sure you can't come?
Yeah, I can't.
You know.
Everyone has to work.
No exceptions.
Plus, Red and I?
We're both kinda supervising.
- Mmm.
- Corporate America claims another victim.
Eric, it's okay.
I knew you weren't gonna go.
You're a really responsible guy.
I love and hate that about you.
Well, since, uh- Since Mr. Smock here is being all logical I guess I'll have to take one of you losers.
- Take a loser where?
- Zeppelin.
Zeppelin?
Oh, my God.
That's a band, right?
Donna.
In the ninth grade, I did an oral report on "Stairway to Heaven," and I got a B-plus.
You gotta take me.
Donna, in the ninth grade, I wasn't a dork and I didn't write a report on "Stairway to Heaven".
And you gotta take me.
God!
She doesn't wanna take either one of you, 'cause she's taking me.
Donna, M-E, me!
Okay, you know what?
I'm going.
I can't.
- You hate it, don't you?
- No, no.
It's interesting.
I mean, just- Just look at all this body.
I must- I bet I'm- I'm like- I'm four inches taller.
I never should've gotten into this.
I'm not good at anything.
No, no, no.
- I like it, Laurie.
- Really?
Thanks, Mom.
Now all you need is a cut.
No, no.
No, no.
No.
Length- Length is good.
Length is good.
Drop 'em.
Oh, hey, did you see this?
They gave me a Price Mart key chain.
It's got a knife and everything.
Yeah, I keep it in my pocket.
Some of the other guys get jealous.
Look, Eric, I know you're very excited about your raise and everything but I don't want you to get too caught up in this.
Don't worry, Dad.
I'm not about to alienate my fellow employees with my award-winning work ethic.
I read the signs in the break room.
There's no "l" in teamwork.
Here's your check, sir, and thank you for eating at Smiley's.
Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny.
You know what, Dad?
I got this.
Take your hand off the check.
I'll come back.
Jackie, why do you wanna go anyway?
You hate Led Zeppelin.
I never said I hated them, Michael.
For your information, I think Led is hot.
- Fez, is that her?
- Yes.
I wish I could go talk to her, but I get so nervous.
Fez, you shouldn't be nervous.
You're awesome.
What girl wouldn't wanna be with you?
Well, there is Jackie, Laurie this girl from gym, another girl from chemistry uh, country-western star Tanya Tucker who does not answer her letters.
- Um- - Okay, stop.
Whatever happened to suave, silky Fez?
You're right.
I forgot about him.
He's hot.
Exactly.
So- Go get her, Fez.
Caroline?
It is Fez.
May I sit?
Okay, thank you.
Great idea, Donna.
Well, excuse me for trying to buy a coworker lunch.
I am not your coworker.
You're a high school kid with a part-time job.
You're temporary.
Uh-oh.
You know what ends fights?
Pudding.
Just give me seven minutes.
Eric, you gotta stop acting like a big shot.
You're not the king of the world, you know.
I'm employee of the month.
I don't have to take this.
This is no good, Kitty.
- What are you gonna do, Red?
He's growing up.
- No, I mean your hair.
Hey there, Harpo.
Where's your horn?
Bob, are you making fun of my hair?
No.
-  Take me.
- No.
-  Take me.
- No.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You're Donna, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- I'm Caroline.
I think we have Spanish together.
- Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Hola.
!
Um, you know that foreign guy you're always hanging out with?
- Fez?
- Mmm, yeah.
Fez.
Um, is- Is he- Does he- Oh, my God.
You like Fez?
- Oh, my God.
Come on.
I'll introduce you to him.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That's okay.
I just wanted to- I gotta go use the baño.
StuPid, stuPid, stuPid.
!
What's goin' on?
Cosmetology is too hard.
I'm quitting.
Laurie, don't you think I wanted to quit nursing school a hundred times?
The first time I put in a catheter, it broke off.
But what if I don't get any better?
Well, you will never know unless you stick with it.
- Oh, what do you care?
- I care because I'm your mother.
So, I care.
Well, we do start doing nails next week.
That might be fun.
And I happen to know a few patients down at the hospital who would love a manicure.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Uh-huh.
Yep.
It's- It's- It's just gonna perk 'em right up when they come out of their comas.
Hey, Dad.
Good news.
Just got another raise.
Well, good for you, you dumb bastard.
Yeah, I tell ya.
If they keep throwin' money at me like this I might be able to get my own apartment soon.
For God's sakes, you're 57 years old.
- Ah.
- Eric, why didn't you listen to me?
If you'd gone to college, you could've really been something.
Been something?
Whoa.
You're talkin' to the interim assistant weekend manager of housewares here, okay?
Yeah.
Show some respect.
Well aren't you just the president ofTurd Town?
Dad.
I've been thinkin' about why you went so crazy and yelled at me and I've come to the conclusion that you're crazy and you like to yell at me.
There's somethin' you gotta know.
You're-Well-You're an idiot.
Oh, great.
A pep talk.
Look, sit down.
When I was your age, I thought I had it all too.
Great job at the plant, nice steady paycheck- Just enough to, you know, string me along for 30 years or so.
And for what?
So they could toss me out on my ass when things got tough.
- Dad, I'm not gonna- - Look, don't get me wrong.
I admire your work ethic.
But you deserve better than Price Mart.
You're a smart guy.
And I'm, uh- I'm proud of you.
Whoa.
Really?
- You-You think I'm smart?
You're proud of me?
- Oh, geez.
What, you gonna ruin this now by talking?
Listen, Dad.
If I'm still workin' at Price Mart when I'm your- older please kill me.
- You don't have to ask twice, Son.
- Oh, that's- - That's my dad.
- Come on.
Let's go make fun of your mom's hair.
- Jerk.
- Wench.
- Tool.
- Dill-hole.
- Moron.
- Moron.
I already said moron.
Moron.
Don't touch.
Those are for Donna.
- Kelso, Donna doesn't want a bunch of dirty cookies.
- They're not dirty.
They are now.
Hyde, you're dead.
Oh, my God.
Donna, where have you been?
The concert starts in an hour.
I'm ready to go.
Let's go.
The concert?
Oh, right.
The concert.
Well, you guys were so busy fighting over the tickets, I forgot to tell you.
I gave them away.
- What?
- No!
- To who?
See?
Your cuticles look better already.
Proper nail care is one of the easiest things to overlook.
Uh-huh.
Real good.
Oh, gosh, Daddy.
I didn't know you were a bleeder.
I'm not.
Um, could you apply some pressure to this while I go get some paper towels?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, guys, guess what I got.
V.D.?
No.
A hundred bucks.
So money to treat your V.D.?
No.
My grandmother gave me this money.
See, my mom told her that she needed to bleach her whiskers and I was like, I go, "What whiskers"?
Which is a total lie, 'cause she's got these honkin' whiskers.
But then it made her so happy she gave me a hundred bucks.
Uh, no offense, Michael, but your mom's not one to talk.
I mean-Whoo!
Hey!
My mother is a beautiful woman.
- Apologize.
- Sorry.
- She's nice.
- Sorry.
- Whisker face.
All right, thank you.
Now we gotta go celebrate this hundred bucks.
Let's all go out to dinner- Someplace expensive.
Someplace nice.
Let's go to the Vineyard.
My new lady love, Caroline, works there.
Caroline from the concert?
Have you guys gone out again?
- No.
- So, have you guys hung out at school?
- No.
- Talked on the phone?
No.
Have you had any contact with her at all?
No.
- So Caroline's your new lady?
- Yes.
- That's great.
- Thank you.
There she is.
Isn't she lovely?
She reminds me of that song "Isn't She Lovely"?
Here she comes.
Here she comes.
Watch me impress her.
- Hi, Fez.
-  Hello, Caroline.
- I just came over to say hi.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Bye.
- Bye.
Did you see how I played her?
- Hey, Kelso, thanks for dinner.
It was great.
- Yeah, it was delicious.
Hey, guys, no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.
Okay.
Everybody ready?
Uh, don't you have to pay first?
- I'm not paying.
- What?
What, did you think I was paying?
- Yes.
Kelso, we don't have any money.
- You don't need any.
People, we are on a "dine and dash" here.
Oh, yeah.
'Cause the only thing better than eating lobster is eating lobster and hauling ass.
Let's haul ass.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Kelso, what the hell are you thinking?
You said you'd take care of it.
And I took care of it- by planning the "dine and dash".
Kelso, we're not doing it.
Why not?
Guys, we're making memories here.
Kelso, it's wrong.
Wrong?
Or hilarious?
Wrong, you dill-hole.
Or hilariously wrong.
I like it.
But then again, I'm from the underbelly of society, so- Uh, yes, excuse me.
Um, would you please send your finest imported beer to Caroline and tell her that when I said "Hi" what I meant was, "I'll take you like a stallion".
You got that?
Like a stallion?
Fez, stop ordering stuff.
Okay, you need to chill out, little girl.
Didn't you hear Kelso?
The Vineyard is having a dine-and-dash promotion.
Everything is free.
It's not free, Fez.
"Dine and dash" is when you run out without paying.
So it's stealing?
This isn't going to help me with Caroline, is it?
Excuse me.
Hey!
That's from me, you son of a bitch.
Oh, good, honey, you're home.
Listen.
The Pinciottis called.
They wanted to have card night tonight, so- No, Kitty, you just call them back, 'cause there's no way in hell that I'm gonna have card night with the Pinciottis 'cause it's just too much fun.
- Hello, Bob and Midge.
-  - What the hell are they doing here?
- I don't know.
So!
Who else needs a drink real bad?
Tough day at the salt mines, Red?
Oh.
When did you get a job at the salt mines?
Here, honey.
Play with these.
Yeah workin'Joe.
I'll tell ya.
Since my business went bankrupt I got a lot of free time.
I mainly use it to nap and cry.
Well, uh, Bob don't cry on the cards.
It makes 'em hard to shuffle.
Michael, I have never dined and dashed, and I'm not about to start now.
Uh, well- Remember when we went to nice restaurants and I told you to wait in the car while I paid?
Did you ever wonder why I was running to the car?
Oh, my God.
I'm a thief.
I think technically you're an accessory.
Which should make you happy, because you love accessories- - earrings, bracelets, bangles, bows- - Shut up!
So, did you enjoy your pilsner?
Did you get the message about the stallion?
Okay, look, okay?
You can't send beer to the hostess podium, okay?
I almost got fired.
So just pretend you don't know me, okay?
I don't think I do know you, Caroline.
Caroline has upset me.
I can't wait to dine and dash on her ass- her beautiful ass.
- I'll go first.
- Hyde, we're not doing this.
And especially not you, 'cause you're on probation.
- So what?
- So what?
You get caught, you go to jail, and I've heard nothing good about jail.
I haven't done one stinkin' illegal thing since I got probation.
So, what, you're mad because you haven't committed any crimes since your last crime?
Yeah, so I'm going.
Can I help you?
- What happened?
- This place is like Alcatraz, man.
There's no way out.
So it was either a U.F.O. Or I rubbed my eyes too hard.
Okay.
Good story, Midge.
So, Red, how's work?
Well, yesterday I hired some new guy down in sporting goods - but I don't know- - Whoa.
You hired a new guy?
Oh, that's funny.
I remember when I was doing the hiring at my store, and you were out of work.
I hired you neighbor.
- Listen, Bob- - No.
Midgie?
- We're going home.
- But I have gin.
We're playing bridge!
I can't do it.
I've gone soft, man.
I'm like Forman.
It sickens me.
Mm.
So you can't do it.
I wonder why.
- Why, oh, why?
- Oh!
I know why.
- Yes, Donna?
- Because it's wrong.
That's right, Miss Pinciotti.
It's wrong.
Gee, what a surprise- Mom and Dad don't want to do it.
We are not Mom and Dad.
And we're not leaving without paying, young man.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll pay for the stupid dinner.
Now just give me your stupid keys so I can get my money out of your stupid car.
Stupid.
I don't care if you're in the freakin' Olympics about to run the freakin' hundred-yard dash- If someone sends you a beer, you say thank you and drink the freakin' beer.
Um, Eric?
Did Kelso leave his money at home?
- 'Cause he just drove away in the Vista Cruiser.
- What?
No.
No, he wouldn't ditch us.
Are you sure?
'Cause as he drove past he was doing this- No.
Donna, he's kidding.
He wouldn't ditch us.
He ditched us!
I'm sure he's right outside.
I'll go get him.
- Fez, I don't know.
- Don't worry.
I'll go and get the money and come back.
You can trust me.
- He's not coming back!
- And we trusted him.
Foreigners lie.
You know what?
I'm just gonna call my dad, and he'll come pay for our dinner.
Okay, but, Jackie, if you don't come back- Eric, please.
I'm not immature like those idiots.
She is immature like those idiots!
I can't believe I got stuck here with the squares.
We're not squares!
Donna, settle down.
You don't want to upset your stomach.
This is bad, man.
If I'm not fighting against the system, I am the system.
Screw it.
I'm going.
Banzai!
Okay, I can take the check now.
Or whenever or now.
Uh- Two more bananas Foster, please.
Eric, what are you doing?
I'm stalling.
They'll come back.
Joke's over, you know?
Best thing about this joke, it just keeps going and going.
And not only did we break the law we screwed our friends while breaking the law.
How dumb was he to give me the car keys?
I mean, who here trusts me?
-  No way.
-  Not me.
Thank you.
You know what?
Stolen food just tastes better.
Dinner roll?
Guys, I feel bad about Eric and Donna.
Maybe we should figure out a way to help them.
Sure, we could do that.
Or we could ask ourselves, "How can we make this worse"?
Happy anniversary Happy anniversary HaPPy anniversary Donna and Eric With best wishes from Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie.
- Oh, this is just terrible.
- Oh, Kitty.
Quincy's no Columbo, but he's still pretty good.
Red, Bob was very upset when he left here.
Bob's always upset.
He's a little girl in big boy pants.
Well, why didn't you offer him a job?
I didn't want to insult him by offering him some nothing job.
Oh, Red, you insult him every day.
But that's different.
He thinks I'm kidding.
Kitty, this is about a man's dignity.
Oh, sure, it was- It was awful, what happened.
But let's just put it behind us and watch Quincy.
Hey!
Oh, come on, Red.
How bad would it be working with Bob?
It's a big store.
You'd hardly ever see him.
Maybe you could- You could hide from him.
He'd find me.
He always finds me.
Well, you better think of something because they are gonna live next door to us for a long, long time.
You don't know that.
He's out of work.
He'll probably lose the house.
Fine.
I'll talk to Bob.
But you gotta work on your sense of humor, lady.
Man, I can't believe those guys screwed us like this.
- Well, at least we still have each other.
- You know what?
You're right.
I can't count on much in this crazy world, but I can always count on you.
That is so true.
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.
Hey!
Why don't you just sit your lyin' ass down?
Eric, don't you trust me?
Not as far as I can throw you, and that ain't far.
How can you say that?
Okay, so I noticed the fire exit was next to the bathroom.
Doesn't mean I'd use it.
I happened to notice it, that's all.
It's very convenient.
Donna, don't you see what's happening?
They've turned us against each other.
You're right.
I was gonna use the fire exit.
I was!
You know why they do this?
Because they know we won't get them back.
We're responsible, mature "Mom and Dad".
We just- We won't stoop to their level.
Well, damn it, let's stoop to their level or an even lower level.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm with you, baby, yeah.
There's just one problem.
We can't do it from in here.
If I don't make it tell Mama I'm sorry.
Don't talk like that.
You'll tell her yourself.
Hey, Bob.
So, taking out your trash, huh?
No, Red, I'm bringing it back in.
Yeah, Bob.
That's a good one.
Listen, I want to offer you a job at Price Mart.
- Geez, Red, Price Mart?
- What?
Yeah, that may be fine for you, but you're talking to a guy who owned his own business.
And ran it into the ground.
Okay, I'm, uh-  I'm sorry.
Just take the job, Bob.
- No.
- Okay.
That's fine, Bob.
There is no job.
Forget it.
Oh, so now you're not offering me a job.
I just offered you the job, and you said you didn't want the job.
Well, ask me again.
Oh, cripes.
You want a job at Price Mart, Bob?
I'll think about it.
Go to hell, Bob!
Okay, you guys.
Okay.
Good one last night.
You know, ditching us at the restaurant and everything.
Yeah, we got you so bad.
You really did.
We laughed and laughed.
To show you guys we're such good sports we made you guys a batch of special brownies.
Special brownies.
Like the sPecial kind of special?
The best kind of special.
Something's wrong.
I don't feel special.
Me neither.
Yeah, I don't think those were special brownies, man.
Oh, no, no.
They're special.
Say, Donna, do you have any more of that sPecial ingredient we used?
Well, I certainly do, Eric.
Chocolate Super-Lax.
- You didn't.
- We did.
We so did.
Now maybe you'll think twice before screwing us.
Well, nice try, 'cause I don't feel any-  -  -   Oh, no.
I am last.
- Ay, no!
- I know.
You're surprised to see me, right?
And upset.
- Yes, many things are upset.
- Okay, listen.
Okay, listen, Fez.
About last night- I know you were angry, and you have every right to be.
But you know what this was?
- Our first fight.
- Oh!
And it made us a real couple- if you can forgive me.
- Fine.
Move away from the door.
- So we're okay?
-  - Good.
Now let's make up like a real couple.
You bastards!
Wait, Fez!
Wait up!
Okay, you guys.
That was a wicked burn.
It had all the elements: You didn't see it coming, parts of it really hurt-  Well, Kelso, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Oh, I did.
I got my eye on you two.
You're not gonna burn me like that again.
- I love our friends.
- Me too.
Hey, Red.
I've been thinking about your offer and I want you to know, I made a decision.
Oh, goody.
But I need you to ask me again.
Bob, would you, uh like a job at Price Mart?
Say it like you mean it.
Go to hell, Bob!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Bob.
That's my soda.
But I drank all mine.
Keep it.
Hey, that's my soda.
Life is unfair.
Oh, swell.
It's Max from the radio station.
His ad rates bled me dry.
I got nothin' to say to him.
Hiya, Max!
Oh, Bargain Bob!
Hey, I'm sorry you lost the store, man.
Sorry?
I lost it by choice.
Yep, I'm doing great.
Got the large fries, you know.
Large fries.
That's great.
I'll see you.
Hey, uh, speaking of fries, you got any jobs down at the radio station?
Oh, not for a guy like you.
I'm currently looking for an office girl but usually my office girls are girls.
Hi.
I'm Donna.
The girl.
Okay, Donna!
Listen, drop by the station and we'll see what we can do.
Sure.
Thanks!
I could have been an office girl.
Aw, that does it.
This tastes like crap!
May I help you, sir?
Yeah.
I wanna compliment you on one tasty, fried piece of shoe.
Let me take care of this right now.
Earl!
Oh, no.
- Did you say Earl?
- Just one second.
Ricky, I'm glad you called me.
I need to leave early for a- Oh.
Hi, Red.
You two know each other?
I used to work for Red.
Then he fired me.
Oh.
Then he and I have something in common.
You're fired!
What did I do?
Hey, Bob.
Job just opened up for you.
Fez?
What instrument's that?
Instrument?
Eric, I got a job!
I'm sorting records atJerry Thunder's radio show!
No way!
WFPP?
That's Jerry Thunder!
The Sound!
And he knows rock stars.
And he gets free concert tickets.
And he gave me this guitar pick from Foghat.
No way!
Eric, there's a whole pile of bumper stickers, and they're free!
No way!
Okay, well, I gotta go.
I gotta go alphabetize the eight-tracks.
No way!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Leo, man, this place is a mess.
Yeah?
You should see my garage.
This is your garage, man.
Well, then you see what I mean.
It's a mess.
National GeograPhic is a beautiful magazine.
There is volcanoes and a gazelle.
And naked- Leo, man, there's a car in here.
- It's an El Camino.
!
- Ohh!
Wow.
Do you think it's mine?
The plate says "Leo's".
No, I mean the car, man.
This guy, huh?
- And this is where we do the interviews.
-  A lot of rock legends have puked in this room.
Good times.
Wow.
So, if I stay here long enough, I might see a rock star throw up?
See it?
You'll probably clean it up.
All right!
-  - Oh, yeah, this is Jerry Thunder- -  - Coming to you on The Sound!
And it looks like we got a new office girl.
What's your name, baby?
Um, Donna.
Mmm.
Well, Donna, you are hot.
So I'm gonna call you Hot Donna.
Okay.
You got yourself a boyfriend, Hot Donna?
Um no.
Mmm.
!
That is good news, fellas.
'Cause Hot Donna is hot.
!
Max, why'd you make me say that?
'Cause I have a boyfriend.
Fine.
You have a boyfriend.
So does Elton John.
No way!
Yeah!
They're a fantastic couple.
I love 'em.
The point is we're selling an image here and an available Hot Donna is good for ratings.
Oh.
Well, what the hell.
Eric won't have a problem with this.
What the hell?
I have a problem with this!
Maybe she dumped you and forgot to tell you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you, Nairobi.
Look, Forman, I wouldn't read too much into this.
Donna probably just said she doesn't have a boyfriend 'cause she's ashamed of you.
Okay, baby, I'll see you later.
Listen, Forman, you're just upset because you know Donna is entering the really cool world of FM radio.
But, you know, feel good, man.
'Cause you'll be like that first sweet relationship she'll look back on fondly while she's on the tour bus straddling rock stars.
Yeah, life just hasn't been the same since I lost the van.
It's hard to get chicks when you don't have wheels.
I mean, sometimes a killer bod just isn't enough.
Amen to that, brother.
Okay, I'll sell the El Camino to you for 500 bucks.
- 400.
- 600.
That's the wrong way.
Um- Uh 500.
No.
Sold.
Sucker.
Eric, don't worry about this whole Donna thing.
I know a lot of girls who are much more realistic for you.
They might be a little heavy, or a little dumb, or have a cockeye, but- Jackie- she didn't break up with me, okay?
- She still loves me.
- Oh.
So you're in the denial stage.
- No.
- See?
Oh, my God, you guys!
This has been the best day ever.
Jerry Thunder has totally taken me under his wing.
And his stories- he's so funny!
Oh!
Elton John has a boyfriend!
Plus, I get to meet Alice Cooper.
Here it is.
I'm gonna see if Alice'll sign this.
Oh, I can't make it to the movie tonight.
See ya.
See?
She still loves me.
Yeah.
Have you met my friend Fat Sally?
Earl.
What brings you here?
Uh, I took the bus.
First off, Kitty, I'd like to say you have a lovely home.
Second of all, screw you, Red.
What?
I'm out of work, and it's all your fault.
How am I supposed to pay my bills or feed my dog or go to Hawaii?
Look, Earl you can't blame me for getting fired.
I didn't make you too dumb to flip burgers.
That's God's fault.
Yeah, well, you know the Christmas card you get of me and my dog every year?
You're off the list.
Yeah.
That's right.
Don't bother checking the mailbox, Red, 'cause it ain't comin'.
I loved his Christmas cards.
They were handmade.
This is Jerry Thunder comin' at you on The Sound!
We got Alice Cooper droppin' by any minute and it is going to be wild!
-  - This is Jerry Thunder- -  - Comin' your way on The Sound where we are enjoying lots of sex, drugs and rock and roll.
Am I right, Hot Donna?
You sure are, Jerry Thunder.
Radio people are the coolest!
That's right.
That's why you want to have sex with us all.
I really do!
Hey, everybody, it's Alice CooPer.
!
Hey, Hot Donna.
Heard about you at the last big rock star meeting.
Hey, Ted Nugent and I were wondering- Did you ever break up with that loser boyfriend of yours?
Not yet, Alice Cooper.
Here's my loser boyfriend right now.
Hey, Donna.
Are you ready to go to the Price Mart ball?
You hear that, everybody?
The Price Mart ball.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we feed your skinny boyfriend to the snake?
- Okay.
-    Damn you, Alice Cooper.
I haven't seen Donna in two days.
She's been spending all of her time at the radio station.
This is a real problem.
Oh, here we go again.
Forman's got a problem.
Well, you know what?
Maybe I got a problem, man.
Did you ever think of that?
Oh.
Man, Hyde, I'm sorry.
Go ahead, man, Unload.
Actually, I'm cool.
And that's how you do it.
You have a problem, and you hold it in, man.
Now, leather up, fruitcake.
I have a problem.
But I guess I'll keep it all inside.
Hey, you guys so, Leo agreed to sell me the El Camino for, like, 500 bucks.
So, what I need from you is Hey, I'm Hyde.
I don't feel anything.
I'm just a frizzy-haired robot.
Hey!
I'm Forman!
I use the same voice to imitate everybody!
It's just that l- l- Nothing.
-  - Oh!
Gilligan screwed it up.
He always screws it up.
Why don't they just kill him?
I don't think you're really mad at Gilligan, Red.
Admit it.
You feel guilty about what haPPened to Earl.
This has nothing to do with Earl.
The professor worked on that coconut radio for three months.
Now how the hell are they gonna get off that island?
Oh.
Well, then I guess I was wrong.
I don't know why I questioned you.
And I'll tell ya- something's going on with that Skipper.
You don't get that fat eating coconuts.
Jackie, you know I wouldn't ask you if this wasn't important.
Okay?
But this is an El Camino.
That's Spanish for "The Camino".
By accepting this check, you are agreeing to two things.
First, you will pay me back in full and you will be my slave for a week.
Meaning, like, your love slave?
No.
More like an errand boy.
You mean, like your errand love boy?
No.
Just errands.
- Okay.
- Good.
Here.
Now, go get your car, and then come by my place.
I need you to hold my toes apart while I paint them.
Well, errand boy you just sold your soul for a car.
Who cares, Fez?
Your soul is like an appendix.
I don't even use it.
Kitty, about this burger- What?
Is it burnt?
Are you gonna fire me?
Make me live on the street with the other hoboes?
Kitty, let it go.
I do not feel guilty!
All right!
I feel guilty!
He'll thank me when his tummy stops hurting.
So how are things with you and  Hot Donna?
Well, if you heard about Hot Donna then you heard that I'm not her boyfriend.
The whole world heard that.
Well, people in Canada heard it.
Oh, honey, Canadians don't matter.
What matters is that you and Donna are okay.
Right?
Mom, I don't even know if we're okay.
She's spending all of her time at The Sound with Jerry Thunder.
That reminds me of when I first started at the hospital.
Your father was concerned that I was spending way too much time down there with all these handsome doctors.
But, Mom, that's stupid.
Doctors aren't important like deejays.
Okay, well, the point is your dad started showing up at the hospital to mark his territory and one of the doctors, who was getting a little fresh, got punched in the mouth.
Dad's so cool.
No, that wasn't cool.
It was embarrassing.
But you married him.
Yes, but it was embarrassing.
Still, you married him.
The point is, you have to trust Donna.
But Dad didn't trust you, and you married him.
Okay, you know what?
I can't talk to you.
Okay, I am here to withdraw my complaint about my overcooked burger.
Uh-huh.
Well, I don't think you can do that.
- Well, I think I can.
- Of course you can.
The customer's always right.
So, you'll give Earl his job back?
Well, the fry cook burnt off his finger this morning so sure.
By the way, don't have the fish sticks.
We haven't found it.
You hear that, Earl?
You got your job back.
You can go to work.
Wait.
You mean right now?
But I'll miss WKRP.
- Okay, man, here are the keys.
- Oh, bitchin'!
You know I was gonna give this car to my son on his 16th birthday.
But then my old lady took him and split.
Yeah, wow.
Sad story.
Keys, please?
- I can't sell you the car, man.
- Oh, man!
Ah, I guess I understand.
Thanks, man.
Hyde, I want you to have this car.
What?
No!
You just said that you couldn't sell the car.
Well, I'm not selling it.
I'm giving it to him, man.
He's family.
He's the son I never had.
You just said you had a son!
Yeah, and Hyde's the son I never had.
Hey, Leo, man, thanks.
You're the best.
The car, the love, the wicked burn on Kelso.
Hey, man, need a lift?
- Eric, what are you doing here?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing here, Donna.
I'm here to say who's who and what's what toJerry Thunder.
Eric, you can't talk toJerry.
He's on the air.
Oh.
Fine.
Then I guess I'll just have to wait.
But let me tell you something- I'll be fuming.
This is Jerry Thunder- -  - Signing off.
And I'll see you around The Sound.
-  -  All right!
Whoo!
Let's get Mr. Big FM Stud out here right now!
Yeah!
Big time!
Eric, why are you being weird?
Donna, I'm gonna make a long story short.
I'm here to kick a little deejay ass, so have a seat.
Hey, Donna.
And this must be the boyfriend, Eric.
Hi.
I'm Jerry Thunder.
You're Jerry Thunder?
Well, that's just great!
Check outJerry Thunder!
Hey, you kids, the night is young.
You guys up for a game of Dungeons & Dragons?
I'll let you be Mandar, the half-elf.
Oh, well.
Another time, perhaps.
Good night.
So, that's Jerry Thunder?
It really turns me off when you're so insecure like this.
We've been together long enough where it's either you don't get it or you don't trust me.
- No, Donna, I trust you.
- Well, then you don't get it.
I finally have something that's really good in my life right now and if you can't handle that, then we have a problem.
So, Eric, do we have a problem?
No, we do not have a problem.
Good.
'Cause I broke my nail on a Styx album, I didn't get to meet Alice Cooper and I am super pissed.
Yeah, well, you know you have a really cool job.
Yeah, I do, don't I?
REO Speedwagon's coming in next week.
I'm gonna see if they'll sign my boobs.
Now we have a problem.
Okay, suddenly you're face to face with the Dragon of Fear.
No!
I should have worn my Gauntlet of Ogre Strength.
Dumb!
Any ideas, Mandar?
Well, there's my Rod of Cancellation, but it's chancy.
Yeah.
You know, a girl once promised to play with us, but she didn't show up.
Cheer up, King Zintar the Great.
Let's get out there and slay that dragon.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- Oh!
- Oh!
That's 16 for me and Hyde and four for the losers!
You guys ought to get a mascot- a big, green, furry loser!
That's- That's not even a thing.
Come on.
Take it to the hoop.
Or maybe you're afraid, 'cause you know I'm gonna slap it down.
Oh, yeah?
Well-Yeah?
You tell her, Eric!
Ooh!
Oh!
How can he stand the embarrassment?
She told you what she was gonna do.
You gotta listen, man.
Eric, why don't you just give me the two points?
Save yourself the humiliation.
Well, why don't you just save yourself the two points, and then the humiliation will be- J-Whatever!
Come on!
Oh, I'm comin', and there's nothin' you can do to stop me.
Eric!
Oh, my God!
Donna's wearing granny panties!
Nice panties, Granny!
Oh, come on.
You have to admit, that was some killer "D".
Oh, no.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Okay, Fez, I got you some Valentine conversation hearts.
-  - Oh, thank you, Caroline.
"Be mine".
Okay.
"Sweetheart".
It really is.
"Kiss me".
Well, I'm not about to argue with candy.
Fez, is there one in there that says, "Get a room"?
No, but here's one that says, "Kiss my brown ass".
Sorry you had to hear that, Caroline.
It's okay.
She asked for it.
Ooh, I gotta get going.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.
Well, well, well.
Look who has a lady.
And to think, I was about to settle for you.
Talk about dodging a bullet.
Hey, hey.
Check out this article in Boys'Life.
"The Square Knot: NotJust For Squares"?
No, this one, about being an astronaut.
I think I'm gonna do that.
Michael, I think there's a prerequisite for being an astronaut.
You have to be not dumb.
Uh-uh.
If they can send a monkey into space, they can send me.
I don't know.
Monkeys are pretty smart.
All right.
Fine, fine.
Make fun.
But when you see my shoe prints on the moon, what are you gonna say then?
Probably, "Hey, some monkey's wearing Kelso's shoes"!
Hey, hey, astro-chimp.
When you come back down to Earth, if your parachute doesn't work you could always use Donna's monstrous panties.
Hey, hey, hey, you guys.
None of that when Donna gets here, okay?
I don't need her mad at me on Valentine's Day.
All right, Forman, relax.
Wearing granny panties is a very sensitive issue that I don't find funny, and I refuse to exploit.
Good.
Hey, everybody, look.
It's Granny Panties!
- Hyde!
- Wha- Oh, sorry, man.
It's in my nature to burn.
Granny Panties understands.
Don't you, Granny Panties?
Okay, look.
I didn't have anything else to wear.
It was laundry day.
I didn't know they made a washing machine big enough for those panties.
Hey!
Hey, you guys can all just shut up, okay?
So she wears big panties.
So what?
Donna, look, I am really, really, really sorry.
Eric, I'm fine.
Let's just forget about it.
Really?
'Cause when I saw your sweats around your ankles, I thought I was dead.
- Eric, I said, I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You are so cool.
- You- l-You are seriously, like, the coolest girl ever.
- Wow.
Chicks must really dig astronauts, 'cause it says here that astronauts get all the Tang they want.
Oh, Donna is gonna love you making dinner for her.
There's nothing sexier than a man who cooks.
Unless that man is Burt Reynolds.
Then I don't give a darn what he's doing.
He's just sexy!
Ooh-hoo, Mom has a thing for the Bandit.
Ten-four.
Go set the table.
Oh, no, no, honey, use the special china.
You don't want to mess up a good thing with everyday dishes.
Okay, but, Mom, it's not like I can mess this up.
I mean, Donna is cool no matter what I do.
Like, earlier, I pulled down her pants in front of everyone in the driveway - and she just stood there- - You did what?
No, it was cool.
She just- She said she was fine.
- Oh.
Then I guess she's fine.
- Yeah, 'cause she said she was fine.
Yeah, she wouldn't say she was fine unless she was fine.
Would she?
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think I'm talking about?
I don't know.
Why are you doing this to me?
- Doing what?
- I don't know!
- Well, all I meant was, have a happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh.
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
Although I doubt you will.
Stop it!
Hello, Michael.
Hi, Mrs. Forman.
Is Laurie home?
I got a little surprise for her.
Oh, you brought her flowers.
Isn't that just a waste of money.
No she deserves them.
I mean, not many people get me, you know?
I'm a complicated guy.
So when everyone starts in on me I just like to be with my girlfriend, 'cause she's nice to me.
- Who are we talking about?
- Laurie.
- Laurie Forman?
- Yeah, so I just want to tell her that I'm happy we're together on this, our nation's day of love.
Oh, well, how patriotic of you, Michael.
Yeah.
I wanna be an astronaut.
Oh.
Well, l- I think you'd make a fine spaceman.
Thanks.
You know, I gotta say, I think Laurie gets a lot of her sweetness from you.
Laurie Forman?
Bye, Laurie.
Hey, man, what the hell are you doing?
What?
Oh, yeah.
I should, uh, probably go out through the window.
Oh, would you look at this?
Ooh, a nice, romantic dinner for two.
Donna's gonna love it.
Why, is she bringing a date?
- Red!
- I'm sorry, but that's funny.
- Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Forman.
- Oh, my.
Look at this vision of lovely.
Oh, this is just like when you two were little, and you-you used to eat pretend supper.
Only now it won't end up with Donna sitting on Eric's head.
Oh.
Oh, Red, let's go.
- Kitty, that was just awful.
- I know.
Keep walking.
Wow, I was afraid that was gonna be awkward.
Yeah.
Eric, this looks so great.
Yep.
Shaked, baked and maked especially for you.
And this here is a little somethin' I like to call"a little somethin'".
You got me a present?
That's so sweet.
I didn't get you anything, and you got me panties?
What the hell?
Yeah, panties!
- Get it?
- No.
To replace your ugly ones.
Eric, when I said I didn't get it, I meant I didn't like it.
No, see, you forgave me earlier and I figured if I brought it up, we could just, you know, share a laugh.
Your turn.
You know what?
You're the one who doesn't get it.
- Well, maybe you should explain it to me.
- I heard that.
!
This is the worst Valentine's Day ever.
It's Donna's fault.
Okay?
I didn't make her wear that big, goofy underwear.
I'm sorry, but if you're hanging out with this crowd you gotta know that eventually your pants are gettin' pulled down.
Am I right?
I am so glad I did not pull down Caroline's pants.
I mean, if she asked me to, I would because I respect her wishes.
And, also, I am so horny.
Forman, when I told you it'd be funny to give Donna panties I meant it'd be funny to me.
And it was.
This is what happened to my heart when I found out Laurie was cheating on me.
It's lemon.
I mean, how could she do this?
I really thought we had somethin'.
Probably the same way you did it toJackie.
Only this time it's even funnier, 'cause it's you.
This is a good day.
Tonight, I am going to ask Caroline to go steady with me because that is the last step before you can do it, right?
Oh, how I want to do it.
I am so horny.
So Michael cheated on me with Laurie, and Laurie cheated on him.
Hmm!
There is a God, and he's on my side.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
My boyfriend's a giant baby.
"Ooh, underwear is so funny.
Poo-poo, pee-pee, caca".
You know what'll make you feel better?
Let's go make mean jokes at Michael's expense.
How will that make me feel better?
'Cause then I'll feel better, and I can cheer you up.
On what planet did Eric think it was okay to pull down my pants?
There are some things that are private, Jackie- for instance, everything under my pants.
I agree.
Keep it to yourself.
Why doesn't Eric understand that when I said, "I'm fine," I meant, I will be fine so long as he kisses my ass for two weeks until I'm actually fine?
He's, like, brain damaged.
Look, he's just not a good boyfriend.
You should dump him, and then we can move to Dallas and be weathergirls.
- So, how was your night?
- He blew it.
Well, what a surprise.
- Wait, you're saying that like it's not a surprise.
- Okay then.
You know, Son, there's a time and a place to pull down a lady's pants.
And a pickup game in our driveway is not one of'em.
Look, Dad, I know it was dumb but Donna said it was fine, and apparently it wasn't fine.
Sit down.
Eric there's a pair of shoes up in your mom's closet.
And one day, I accidently stepped on one of them and scuffed it.
"Don't worry," your mom said.
"Everything's fine".
But every now and then, she takes them out of the closet and she puts them on, and she does this.
"Ohh".
Then she takes them off and puts them back in her closet.
Eric, this has been going on for 14 years.
So why doesn't she just get new shoes?
Oh, Eric you are so young.
You see, women are- What's the word I'm looking for here?
Crazy.
Oh.
So, overall, you and Mom are okay.
So Donna and me, we'll be okay, right?
No.
I scuffed your mom's shoe.
I didn't pull her pants down in front of God and the foreign kid.
So, what are you saying?
I'm screwed with Donna?
Hey, if it makes you feel any better I'm surprised you lasted this long.
- I like popcorn.
Do you like popcorn?
- Yes.
- I like candy.
Do you like candy?
-  Yes.
I like soda.
Would you like to go steady with me?
- Oh, yes, Fez!
- I think I might have tricked you.
You do know we are going steady, right?
Yes!
- What a magical night.
- Yes.
I dreamed of this since the moment we met.
- Me too.
-  You know, this is my favorite movie of all time.
I've seen it, like, 16 times.
That woman keeps calling Clint Eastwood and asking him to play "Misty" for her.
Isn't it romantic?
Romantic?
But she is following him and bothering him and threatening him.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
If she can't have him, nobody can.
Okay then.
Oh, you're so cute.
I love being your girlfriend.
- If you ever left me, I'd kill you.
-   O- Okay then.
What's up with Eric's head anyway?
It's completely out of proportion to that skinny body.
He looks like a Blow Pop.
You know, I bet Michael's gonna want me to feel sorry for him.
But I'm gonna be all, like "Aww.
Bite it, Casanova"!
- Hey, Jackie, Donna.
- Hey, Michael.
I heard what happened.
- Yeah.
Me and Laurie are done.
- Doesn't Eric look like a Blow Pop?
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.
Uh, listen, uh, Jackie, can we go somewhere and talk?
No!
Look, anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Donna.
Well, okay.
Uh, listen what happened with me and Laurie got me thinking.
And what she did was really a betrayal and it hurt so much.
So you want me to feel sorry for you.
- No, don't feel sorry for me.
- Wait, what?
No, I deserve this.
After what I did to you?
I don't know if you've made the connection, but there are a lot of similarities between what Laurie did to me and what I did to you.
Except you and I were really in love and you trusted me.
Jackie, I let you down, and I'm sorry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you just saying this stuff so I'll give you Valentine sex?
'Cause this is a holy day, Michael and you should be ashamed of yourself.
No.
I just said what I wanted to say, and I don't blame you if you never want to speak to me again.
That's it.
Good-bye.
Jackie, are you okay?
Sure.
Great.
I'm just sitting here alone on Valentine's Day.
- Hey, I'm here.
- Yeah, why are you here?
You should be with the one you love.
And you love Eric for some reason.
Shut up.
There's a lot of reasons.
He's not a Blow Pop.
He's a sweetie pie.
Then you should be with him.
Look, take it from someone who has loved and lost.
Whatever he did isn't worth being alone on this holiest of days.
Jackie, are you actually thinking about me instead of yourself?
Yeah!
God, I've had way too much sugar!
Look, Eric, we need to talk.
Before, I told you everything was fine when it wasn't.
So, I'm sorry for not letting you know what a colossally insensitive bonehead you are.
Oh, apology accepted.
That's very big of you.
No, I'm serious.
So from now on when you piss me off I will do you the courtesy of blowing up in your face.
Oh, Donna, that's all I ask.
And as for my part, I've realized that somewhere along the way we crossed a line where pulling down your pants in public is really no longer that funny.
And I suppose that point came when - you started letting me pull them down in private.
- Exactly.
So are we good?
Yeah.
No.
- Are we good now?
- Gettin' there.
- Just- Come on.
Let me put my pants on.
- Nope.
But it's really cold.
And- You know, I'm freezing off parts of my body that I know you've expressed appreciation for.
Eric, for God's sakes, no one wants to see that.
Yeah, now we're good.
Ohh.
- Something wrong, honey?
- No.
Everything's fine.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey.
What are you guys up to?
We're spending the weekend at a hotel.
What, car sex isn't good enough anymore?
I would love car sex.
Or just sex.
Or just a car.
I have to get out of town.
Ever since my dad lost the store he just shuffles around in a not-completely-closed bathrobe.
It's really depressing.
"The Wisconsin Dells' most romantic hideaway.
Hunters and truckers always welcome".
- That's nice.
- Sounds awesome.
I'm gonna go pack.
You guys.
The weirdest thing just happened with Pam Macy.
Kelso, man, she'll do that with any guy standing in front of her.
Okay.
So, I'm making out with Pam in the orchestra pit and everything is progressin' like normal until- - What?
- You know the really, really bad thing that can happen to guys when they're with girls.
Oh, did Mr. Cooper come in to buff the floor?
No.
Okay.
Let me put it this way.
The buffer wouldn't buff.
Poor Mr. Cooper.
No, Fez.
I think what he's tryin' to say is the rabbit wouldn't come out of the hat.
The weasel wouldn't pop.
The alphabet soup never spelled "go".
Okay!
All right!
Enough!
Actually, not quite.
There are a lot of Amish people but they never raised a barn.
Forman, man, that was awesome.
Hey.
It just came to me.
Oh, I get it.
The barn is Kelso's pants.
Okay!
You guys, this is not funny!
- This is, like, a nightmare.
- Yes.
Eric, stop teasing.
Kelso, I want you to know that I feel bad for you and that I am sorry you are not a man!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
So, looks like I'm gonna spend the weekend with Kelso- tutor him in math.
Really.
Hmm.
So, you're allegedly tutoring Kelso in math.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you good in math?
What's the square root of"x"?
- Um, I really can't answer that.
- Aha!
No.
See, "x" is a variable, so until you define its parameters the only possible answer is a variable- or "x" if you prefer.
Is that right?
Sounds good.
- Will Michael's parents be home?
- Yes.
Are they as dumb as he is?
I can't lie.
Yes.
Yes, they are.
Right answer.
That was a trick question.
I know they're dumb.
So, I can go?
You can go, but I'll be watching the news.
And if anything is vandalized or explodes or catches on fire "x" is gonna equal me kicking your ass.
So, anyway, Jackie's, uh, havin' trouble in school stuff and, uh, I thought I should stay with her this weekend- tutor her in, you know, stuff.
- Anyone?
- I'm sorry, honey.
I can't concentrate when your father's robe is open.
Leave me alone.
I'm ventilating.
Okay.
See ya Sunday.
Jeannie, I'm home.
-  - Oh.
Hello, GenieJackie.
Hello, Master Major Michael.
How was your day?
Pretty good, pretty good.
But I'm starvin'.
I've been on the moon all day, and I missed lunch.
- I can fix that.
-  Damn.
I love havin' a genie.
- Well, let's eat.
- Okay.
Unless you're hungry for something besides food, Master.
Actually, I'm havin' a little problem in this department lately.
- Not anymore.
-  Ho-ho!
You're the best genie ever!
Hello?
Pam?
I'm back!
You know, Red, with the house empty this weekend it might be a- a nice opportunity for a little romance.
Uh-huh.
Is that, "Uh-huh, my passion burns for you" or "Uh-huh, you're as exciting as an old hat"?
Well, what kind of old hat?
How about a hat that's about to be super P.O.'d?
Oh.
Then the passion one.
Okay.
I'm gonna sneak some beer outta the fridge.
You go be lookout.
You can count on me.
Hyde, the Formans are home.
- A little late, Fez.
- It's funnier this way.
Okay, you two, out.
Here.
Here, you can each have a Snack Pack.
Thank you, Mrs. Forman.
Ooh.
Chocolate.
Okay, Kitty.
I'm gonna cook you a romantic dinner.
So, you go put on something pretty and I'll warm up the toaster oven.
Oh, wow.
Dinner from the toaster oven.
Ha ha.
Well, whoop-de-do.
I'll put on my fancy dress.
Okay.
I'm gonna work on Plan "B".
Oh, I would.
This place is awesome.
I know.
There's gotta be, like, 17 pillows on this bed.
What's this?
Oh, my God.
It's a tiny fridge with, like, a million bottles of tiny liquor.
And tiny cookies.
Oh, yeah?
Well, in there- tiny shampoo and tiny soap.
Donna, I think elves work here.
I feel so classy.
I'm stealing all of it.
Look, Pam, I'm really sorry about what happened again.
I must have the flu or something.
Well, it's not like any flu I've ever heard of.
Well, there's lots of kinds of flu, Pam!
I'm sorry.
Oh, well, don't take it so hard.
Oops.
Sorry.
Look, just don't tell anybody, okay?
Oh, Flopsy, I'm not gonna tell anybody.
I'm gonna tell everybody.
-  - Eric.
Do you know that if you mix Kahlúa and scotch, it tastes just like Dr. Pepper?
You're cute.
Okay.
I think you're cute too and a little drunk- which is gonna make my job a whole lot easier.
What's that?
- I guess the guy next door thinks we're being too loud.
- Oh, yeah?
What-  Oh, my God.
He just pounded right back.
Uh, okay.
You know what?
Let's just be quiet.
-  - But then he wins, Eric.
We need to get the last pound.
See?
We won.
We're not gonna take crap.
We're gonna give it, 'cause we're fearless.
-  - Oh, my God.
He's at the door.
Okay, you know what?
I think I have a little fear.
So, let's just, uh, be really quiet and pretend we're not here.
- And maybe he'll just think we're not here.
-  Okay.
Will you cut it out!
Okay, look, just stay in here and shush.
-  Okay.
-   - Eric!
- Dad.
Hey, it's Big Red.
Son of a bitch!
What the hell are you doing here?
Wait.
What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.
Who are you with?
Your mother, you dumb-ass.
Okay.
I'm gonna make a deal with you.
I never saw you.
I don't know you're here.
Wait.
So we're good?
No, no.
You're gettin' your ass kicked on Monday.
But for now, you shut up and stay here.
If your mother sees you, my fun time is over.
Oh, this is just awful!
Oh.
No, hey, cheer up.
I've been in trouble with Red before.
It's okay.
No, it's not that.
It's just seeing your dad reminded me of my dad.
Your dad's going away on nice weekends and having fun and my dad's out of work and sad.
Plus your robe's not completely closed, and that reminds me of him too.
Okay.
Okay, you know what?
Let's turn that frown upside-down.
That's right.
Let's have super-hot sex, baby.
And by super-hot sex, I mean let's talk about your sad feelings.
Okay, Jackie, I have some really terrible news about Kelso that will make us both laugh a lot.
Yeah.
I already know.
Pam Macy made this big announcement in gym.
Jackie, this is where we both laugh a lot.
Actually, Fez, I don't find it that funny.
I kinda feel sad for him.
But you hate him.
He totally screwed you over.
Yeah, but he's grown up a lot since then.
And he's suffered, and I'm over it by now.
Poor Michael.
Poor Michael?
Well, I see I have wasted my time talking to you.
Good day, miss.
- Wait, Fez.
- I said good day.
What should we do with all of this time alone?
-  - I'll get that.
I ordered you a special surprise.
Ta-da!
Donna?
Donna is my surprise?
Donna?
What the heck are you doin' here, Donna?
What the heck?
Mrs. Forman, Eric is being a jerk, and I wanted to talk to my mom.
But since she's not here, can I talk to you?
Eric's here too?
What on earth is goin' on?
What the heck?
- Red, what is going on here?
- Oh, I'm just as surprised as you.
Oh, all right!
- Eric and Donna are the noisy people next door.
- And you didn't tell me?
Hello, Mommy?
I'm sad!
Donna, where have you- Your mother kicked me out.
Oh, no.
I said no.
Guys, I gotta tell you somethin'.
I'm omnipotent.
-  -  Huh.
This does taste like Dr. Pepper.
Told ya.
Hey, you know what?
I think I might puke.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.
Honey, nobody gets sick in Mr. And Mrs. Forman's room.
You know, it is a lovely room.
Red just saw the brochure on the counter and then he whisked me up and he brought me here.
It was very Humphrey Bogart.
Eric did the same thing for me.
- Sometimes he's really sweet.
- Uh-huh.
Do you have a bucket?
-  -  Room service.
Honey.
Honey, pretty girls do not throw up.
Oh, no, no.
No, no.
I didn't order this.
Oh, uh, it was ordered by a Mr. Red Forman.
Oh, my gosh.
This must have been his surprise.
Oh!
Flowers, champagne.
Cashews.
The most expensive nut, you know.
Oh, dear, sweet Red.
I have to go see him.
- Are you feeling better?
- No.
Okay, good.
Nighty-night.
Why is everything doing that?
Hey, Michael.
I heard what happened with Pam.
And I want you to know, that according to CosmoPolitan magazine, you're not a freak.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
They say that, lots of times when it happens to a guy it's not that he can't, it's just that he secretly doesn't want to.
Okay, well, not to criticize but Cosmo's never seen Pam Macy naked.
Michael, just think about it.
Do you like Pam?
Well, I like parts of her.
Well, maybe that's not enough.
And maybe your body's mature enough to realize that even if your brain isn't.
Okay, well, you know, if this is about maturity then I want nothing to do with it.
Look, Michael, don't worry, okay?
When you find the girl you're meant to be with you'll be able to do all the stuff you want.
I promise.
I hope you're right.
Thanks, Jackie.
- I'm back.
- What?
Nothin'.
Good hug!
Out.
But it's my room.
Love ya, sweetie.
Donna.
Donna, are you there?
-  - Donna, Please oPen the door, Please.
Great.
I'm locked out of both rooms.
Well, at least I don't have any pants.
I want you to open that door right now.
Our daughter's in there, and she's drunk.
I really shouldn't be doing this.
Okay.
Then I'll just sue you until you're dead.
-  You get off my daughter.
!
-  Bob.
!
What the hell?
Red?
Ooh.
!
Kitty, what a Pretty nightgown.
Thank you, Midge.
Could you hand it to me, Please?
Look, I'm sorry about getting all tipsy last night.
Oh, no.
Please, I'm sorry.
- The fight was all my fault.
- Fight?
We had a fight?
No.
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
Obviously you did something.
I want to know what it is in case I'm still mad about it.
Well, okay.
I had said that you were the most beautiful girl in the world and then you got all mad and said, "Get bent".
Not your finest hour, but I still love you.
Wow.
You must be really upset about this.
Um kind of, yeah.
Well, come on, Eric.
Let's turn that frown upside-down.
That's right.
Let's have super-hot sex, baby.
Oh, crap.
Well, GenieJackie, I am in the mood for some hot master-genie lovin'.
Oh, I'm sorry, Master Major Michael.
But what we are going to have is a warm master-genie friendship.
In fact, I am the master now, and you are the genie.
Except you will not have any genie powers.
You will just do as I say.
Now, do my math homework, Genie.
No.
!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Wow, Hyde.
I can't believe it.
Your own set of wheels.
Yep.
She is the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, except for that one time Kelso swallowed that fishhook.
That was pretty cool too.
Yeah, that was one magic trick I could never get right.
All right, Hyde, this car is fine but, I mean, it's no Vista Cruiser.
How many miles you gettin' to the gallon?
- Oh, about 11.
- Damn!
Okay, fine.
But, you know, the Vista Cruiser can seat eight- nine if someone sits on the stain.
Yeah, okay, Forman, but do you have any idea how many chicks I can fit in the flatbed?
Thirty-two.
And that's with Big Rhonda.
Damn!
Eww!
Oh, hello.
What are you doing back there, Fez?
L- I was- I was just showing Caroline the back of my new car and my tongue.
Fez, this isn't your car.
Yeah.
Foreigners can't drive here unless it's a cab.
Shut up.
Isn't he cute?
Fezzie, I told you.
You don't have to try and impress me anymore.
I'm your girlfriend now.
I'm sorry, Caroline.
From now on, I will be totally honest.
- Good.
Now, come on, walk me home.
- Ah, yes.
And on the way, I can tell you about the time I killed a shark with a coconut.
All right, Kelso, let's go out cruising for hot chicks with self-esteem problems.
Yeah.
No, thanks, man.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Shut up and come on.
No, man, I mean it.
I've matured.
Hey, Donna, wanna go to the mall?
Rerun from What's HaPPening is opening up the new Dairy Queen.
Actually, Jackie, as fun as that sounds, um, no.
What?
"Hey, hey, hey".
- I'm in.
- Okay.
Well, let me get my beret and some Certs with Retsyn.
Cool.
Wait a second.
You're too mature to go cruising with me, but you go to the mall with Jackie?
Yeah.
It's this new thing we're trying, man.
We're friends.
See, I did some reflecting, and I realized thatJackie is the only girl I want to be with.
Today?
No, every day.
See, we were meant to be together.
She just doesn't know it yet.
Yeah, but I have a plan.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.
See, she wants to be just friends, right?
Okay, so I'll be her friend.
But what she doesn't realize is that I'm also a boy.
Yeah, and sooner or later, friend is gonna lead down the path to boy.
And then I'll be her friend-boy.
That is a great plan.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Hey.
Let's go, friend.
Okay.
That is such a bad plan.
Yeah, but, you know, on the bright side maybe we'll be there when it all blows up in his face.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Happy birthday.
Ohh.
I can't believe you remembered.
You are the first person to say anything all day.
And how did you know I needed more flashbulbs?
Thank you.
- So, do you wanna stay for dinner?
- Oh, no, thanks.
- I'm just gonna grab a sandwich.
- A sandwich!
Steven, a sandwich is a sandwich, but a Manwich is a meal.
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Uh-huh.
Hey, Mom, what's for dinner?
I'm starving.
- Manwiches.
- Again?
Ahh, we just had those.
Kitty, I left my shirt on the bed.
It needs to be ironed for tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Oh, and, uh I know you think I forgot, but I didn't.
Oh, Red, I knew you'd remember.
Yep, the check for the plumber is on the dresser.
Oh.
Good.
Um is there anything else to eat?
Well, you know what, honey?
I don't give a good gosh darn what you eat!
Wow, she's really upset.
Yeah.
Nice goin'.
See, the boatneck adds dimension to your shoulders.
And the plum color- that really accents your jewel-toned eyes.
Oh, my God.
Michael, you just described my perfect outfit.
You are so good at this.
Yeah, I have a knack for ensembles.
Hey, Hyde, how goes the cruising for chicks?
It was going fine till I hit a patch of ice and almost took out a few of'em.
Big Rhonda cracked my brake light.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Have you seen Fez?
Uh, no.
He went bowling with his host parents.
Damn him!
I'm sorry.
I was just hoping he'd be here so we could study together.
Now I have to walk home alone in the dark.
It's scary out there.
Somebody ran over Big Rhonda.
- Um, do you want a- - Okay!
Ride?
You know, Michael, I'm really enjoying our time together.
Really?
Me too.
Yeah, you know, the makeup, shopping, braiding each other's hair- - you are like the girlfriend I never had.
- Oh.
Well, thanks, Jackie.
L-Wait.
- Girlfriend?
-  Yeah.
I mean, Donna's nice and everything but she kinda dresses like a trucker.
The Waltons.
Now, there's a grateful family.
Mmm.
And, boy, did they love their mother.
Oh, great.
I think I've got athlete's foot.
I am- l- I am going to bed.
Where'd your mother go?
To bed.
Man, what's wrong with her anyway?
Oh, who knows?
She's been moody all day.
Let me see the TVGuide.
Ahh.
Let's see.
What day is it?
Ah, it's the 13th.
It seems to me I was supposed to do something on the 13th.
Oh, good Lord!
You forgot your mother's birthday!
Oh, no.
Dad, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.
All right.
Don't start gettin' all twitchy.
Now, we gotta think.
Let's watch CHiPs and think.
So, Fez is really nice, huh?
- Yeah, Fez is a good guy.
- Yeah.
You know, sometimes, when I'm trying to sleep at night I think about how much it would hurt if he ever left me.
And then I say, "Fez would never leave me".
But then I say, "We've only been going out for a short time.
Maybe he would leave me".
So then, I hold my breath until my lungs are about to explode because that's how much I think it would hurt if he ever did leave me.
And then, when I regain consciousness I start breathing again, and everything's fine.
Oops.
There's my house.
Thanks!
Bye!
- See ya.
-   Happy birthday!
Oh, you remembered?
Well, of course we remembered, honey.
We just figured that we'd wait till there was only 15 minutes left in the day and you were good and mad and then we'd sneak up here and surprise the hell out of you.
Wow, what a good plan.
'Cause I was awfully mad.
Yeah.
We really had you going.
Here, Mom.
Open this one first.
- It's from me.
- Well, thank you, honey.
Oh, a map of Wisconsin.
Oh, well, thank you.
And, Mom, I got you these balloons too.
"Knock out the knock-knocks at Schiffy's Gas-N-Go".
Huh.
Wait, Kitty, there's more!
A funnel.
'Cause I know how much you like to pour things.
Well, um, either these gifts are really thoughtful or you bought a bunch of crap at the gas station!
- What?
- Oh, admit it, Red Forman.
You forgot my birthday.
-  - Quick, Dad, give her the lighter.
Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.
But it's just- Well, marking the calendar is your responsibility.
Oh.
Dad, no.
Ah, good morning, sunshine.
So, what's for breakfast?
A funnel.
Ow.
What the heck makes Jackie think I'm her girlfriend?
All I did was pick out a few of her outfits paint her nails and give her a facial.
Gee, I don't know, Denise.
Um, guys, can we go inside?
I'm freezing my choo-choos off.
No way.
I'm not going in there.
I forgot my mom's birthday.
Really?
'Cause I remembered your mom's birthday.
- If you remembered, why didn't you tell me?
- How would that be funny?
I don't ever have to worry about forgetting Caroline's birthday.
She wrote it on my arm with permanent marker.
- Isn't she sweet?
- More like psycho.
What are you doing calling my girlfriend psycho?
I'm sorry, Fez, did I say psycho?
I meant nut bag, head case, wackadoo.
She chokes herself, man.
Well, Hyde, maybe- maybe you should- maybe you should choke yourself!
Good day.
- Fez- - I said good day!
Man, what fun is it being a girlfriend if you don't even have your own boobs to play with?
So what, Kelso?
So you're her girlfriend.
What could possibly be so bad about that?
L-I'll tell you what could be so bad.
Oh, Michael, this is the happiest day of my life.
Thank you so much for being my maid of honor.
That's what girlfriends do.
I'm just honored you asked me.
Yeah, but you know, on the flip side, try to think about your life withoutJackie at all.
Wow.
That's even worse.
Hey, girlfriends sometimes make out together, right?
Yeah, usually right after long, sweaty pillow fights.
Yeah, man, it happens all the time.
All right!
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
- Is Eric home?
- Eric?
Oh, you mean my son, the map giver.
I don't know, and I don't care.
- Mrs. Forman, are you okay?
- Oh, I am just freakin' fine!
What happened?
Well, you know I love my family.
It's just sometimes I want to get in the car and run 'em all over.
They forgot my birthday.
I'm gonna go kick Eric's ass right now!
No.
I mean, it's one thing when they don't notice when I get my hair done differently- which they don't- but this is my birthday.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I expect too much.
No, Mrs. Forman, you have every right to be mad.
In fact, you should be madder.
You're, like, the best mom in the world.
Yeah!
Thank you, Donna.
I just wish my own family would say that once in a while.
Oh, sweetie, that's not your breakfast, is it?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
Why don't you just let me make you some nice waffles instead?
Oh, cool.
I love frozen waffles.
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, no.
I make my waffles from scratch.
Those bastards!
Now, would you look at her boobs?
I am.
And it's- it's disgusting.
I mean, what is she thinking, packing in those sweet melons like that?
I can't even look away.
You know, Michael, I have to say, I'm really enjoying our new friendship together.
- I love spending time with you.
- Me too.
Do you wanna go to your house and have a nice, sweaty pillow fight?
Okay.
- Hello, Caroline.
- Oh, hi, Fez.
So, hey, listen, just, uh-just curious um do you sometimes choke yourself?
Yeah.
But I only do it because I love you more than anything in the world.
Okay, I'm good with that.
I'll get you a soda, lover.
Don't forget to breathe while I'm gone.
Hey, so how's it going with "Mental Mary"?
I owe you an apology, Hyde.
She is crazy.
But she's crazy for me.
Yeah.
Oh!
Here she comes.
Oh, my God.
She didn't even look at us.
-  - I don't think I've ever seen Mom so mad.
Have you?
- Not since she stopped drinking.
- What?
Nothing.
Look, obviously your mother's very upset about something.
And desperate times call for desperate measures.
For the last 10 years she's been asking us to do something and every time we say no.
Because what she wants is the most horrible thing in the world.
I won't do it.
Oh, you will do it.
And you will like it!
Need a partner Turn the partner by the right hand round I can't believe we're finally square dancing.
Oh, this is so much fun.
It looks like "Hee-Haw" puked in here.
Come on, honey, let's dance.
Oh, my God.
This is awful.
She made me waffles.
Now promenade, you son of a bitch!
Bow to your partner corners, all Circle to the left go around that hall Circle to the left all around you go When you're there and then Do an allemande left with the corner maid Do-si-do with a partner there Then start by the left in the middle Go all the way around and then pick up your partner with an arm around Start a Promenade and go around that town Then when you're there, ladies you backtrack Go the other way around Meet a Partner Turn the Partner by the right hand round And back to the corner for an allemande left Buck right in for right and left grand Whoo-hee So, Mom, we found this present we just had to get you.
So, happy birthday.
Ohh.
I thought square dance night was my present.
It is.
But we really messed up this year.
- Well, we're sorry.
-  Ohh.
"World's Darn Tootin'est Mom".
Do you really think so?
You're darn tootin'.
Okay.
Well-  I think I've had enough do-si-dos for one night.
So, what do you say we all go home and have hot fudge sundaes?
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.
Bastards.

- Anniversary.

Well, I think we got 'em all.
Uh, Dad, we forgot her birthday again.
Damn it, Eric, pay attention!
Valentine's Day.
Check.
- Anniversary.
- Check.
- Mother's Day.
- Check.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
So if"x" equals seven, then "y" equals- - Two?
- Wrong.
Kelso?
Uh "L"?
Also wrong.
It's a pretty simple equation, guys.
Just think about it for a second.
You're so pretty.
You don't even need to know math.
That's so weird.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Steven, you're so pretty you don't need to know nothin'.
- That's good, 'cause I'm stupid.
-  Oh, real mature, guys.
- Fez, what happened?
- I was walking back from the pep rally flush with school spirit when-when-when some boys from Fort Anderson, they jumped me and they slapped me, and they beat me- And look at what they did to my pom-poms.
Hey, that's not funny, man.
It's really not.
They spray painted me on my ass.
I want revenge against those Fort Anderson Snapping Turtles.
Look, Fez, I'll tell you what.
Let's go to the garage, and I'll get you some paint thinner.
- Ay, no.
- I'm sorry, Fez.
It has to be done.
Yeah, and the three of us have to watch.
Fine.
But this time, no smoking.
Great.
Now maybe we can get some work done.
Michael's so sweet.
Uh-oh.
- He's just so- - No!
- Do you think that Michael and l- - Don't even say it, Jackie.
- I think maybe- - I'll kill myself, I swear to God.
He and I should get back together.
Jackie, do you remember how Kelso cheated and hurt you and lied to you?
Listen to yourself, Donna.
"Cheat-ed".
"Hurt-ed".
"Lie-duh".
It's all ancient history.
But when we look into each other's eyes I know we're both thinking about the same thing.
Your hair?
No.
That we're meant to be together.
Look, I need to know that he's really changed.
I need to test him somehow.
- I agree.
- You do?
Absolutely.
If you get back with Kelso, you better have him tested.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Okay.
I want to see if Michael is ready to be in a healthy, adult relationship so I've come up with five psychological tests.
Damn, Jackie.
He can't even spell "psychological".
Look, besides, he only has to get three out of five.
And the first test is on maturity.
Oh, man.
So we're trying to get the paint off of Fez's butt, right?
So I started to spray lighter fluid on it.
And Fez gets all mad, right?
And then he started chasing me, but he had his Pants around his ankles.
So then he tripped and fell, and I think he hurt himself but I don't know, 'cause I was, like, out of there.
So what's going on with you guys?
Donna and I were discussing our careers.
I'm going to high-end cosmetics and Donna thinks she'll make a great lumberjack.
Stop telling everybody that.
So what kind of career do you see yourself in?
Okay, well, I was considering becoming a doctor.
Ooh.
A doctor?
That's so mature.
Or a rodeo clown.
Rodeo clown?
You want to be a rodeo clown.
Why?
Rodeo clowns are the unsung heroes of the new West.
And you know I've always enjoyed being inside of barrels.
Cheese puffs!
Ow!
Well, see, they're not for you.
They're for Bob and Midge's party.
Oh.
Bob and Midge are having a party?
Well, I can't go.
I'm very, uh busy.
Oh, wait.
Bob didn't invite you?
No, but thanks for the heads-up.
I'll be sure to avoid them.
Huh.
Midge didn't invite me either.
But I'm sure they're having a party.
I saw them bring a keg and a lot of chairs into the house.
Well, you don't know that they're having a party.
Bob's out of work.
The two of them might be starting some weirdo church.
You know, the kind of church where you, uh sit around on chairs and drink beer.
I'm sure Midge will be over any minute- the last minute, like always, to invite us.
I tell ya.
I like the sound of a beer church.
Hi, neighbor.
I have something I want to ask you.
- Oh, really?
- Can I borrow your big punch bowl?
A big punch bowl?
Oh, my, what would that be for?
Uh-oh.
I should have thought this through.
You know, forget about it.
I'm gonna get someone else to bring it.
And by "someone else," I mean Bob.
Midge, l- I already made your cheese puffs.
Ooh, thanks.
Mmm!
Boy, all these cheese puffs are really gonna come in handy.
'Cause Bob's so hungry.
We're not having a party.
Okay, this next test is about consideration.
I want to see if he'll choose my interests over his.
This is gonna be so funny.
- Grape.
- So Michael- There are two events occurring this weekend.
One that you might like and one that I would really, really, really really want to go to.
Now, should we go see the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders-  Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.
- Yes, or- - No.
Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.
- But Michael, I want- - No.
Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders!
See?
Funny.
Kelso, what are you doing?
We're just tossing around this egg Jackie gave me to take care of.
Don't you think it might break?
Yeah, uh, well, we just thought we'd have some fun with it before I threw it at somebody.
You are such a moron.
- You are so gonna failJackie's test.
-  Test?
What test?
I'm not supposed to say anything, butJackie's testing you to see if you're ready to get back together.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
- Do you think I have a chance?
- Not a good one.
You've already failed two tests and you're about to fail the third.
That egg is a test of your parenting ability.
So what you're saying is if I break that egg then I fail the test, and loseJackie the girl I love more than anything in the world?
- Hyde, give me the egg.
- Okay, catch.
Whoops.
I mean-  Okay, you guys let's do this for Fez.
Finally my butt cheeks will be avenged.
Voilà.
Guys, I feel like we accomplished something today.
I feel like we made a difference.
Oh, I'm not done yet.
Taste my wrath, Snapping Turtles.
That was a close one.
Crap!
The janitor locked us in.
Yep.
No good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, my God.
How could this get any worse?
Okay, guys we have 20 seconds until the cherry bomb in the toilet goes off.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just this little crib-like thing I made for Eggy.
- Eggy?
- Yeah, I named him.
I don't know, this egg is, like, bringing out all the parental stuff in me.
Michael, what happened to the pencil mark I made on the bottom?
Oh.
Must have come off when I was giving him his gentle bath.
Nice.
Michael, I knew you had this in you.
- You are gonna make a great dad one day.
- Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Somebody needs a change.
Oh, I just can't believe Midge would do this after all the years we've been friends.
She took the cheese puffs.
All the cheese puffs?
What the hell?
I wanted some of those.
Red, this isn't about the cheese puffs.
Well, maybe not for you.
They're so light and fluffy.
- This is all your fault.
- What?
You're always mean to them.
Now you've driven them away.
I hope you're happy.
Actually, Kitty, I am happy.
Them not inviting us to the party is not the end of the world.
In fact, it's the start of a beautiful new world- a world where we don't get invited to the Pinciottis'.
There's no talking to you.
You're just sour.
You're an old, sour crab apple.
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm not the one that didn't invite you to a party.
If you've got something to say, you say it to the Pinciottis.
Well, you talked me into it, Red Forman.
Let's go.
Oh, no.
Look at us- locked in a locker room.
Oh, the irony is not lost on me.
-  - Why do you mock us, Fate?
Okay, you guys, we gotta think about a way to get out of here.
Okay, guys, I've just gone through every escape-from-prison movie - I could think of, and I came up with something.
- What?
Steve McQueen is a total bad-ass.
Okay, thanks, Hyde.
That's not helping.
If we don't get out of here, a bunch of jocks are gonna come in here and kick our asses.
Why did I put a cherry bomb in the toilet?
It doesn't smell like cherries at all.
Come on, guys, think.
Yeah, yeah.
Right.
Gotta be something we can do.
I got it.
Much better.
Yeah.
Now instead of feeling scared and anxious I feel relaxed and relaxed.
I know we're probably gonna get beaten but it was worth it because we've shown we have tremendous school spirit.
Go Vikings.
School spirit is for losers, man.
You're just, like, floating along on a conveyor belt of conformity.
Pep rallies, extracurricular activities washing your hair- It's all just a trap, man.
Yeah, Fez.
It's one thing to root for a football team but to confuse the Point Place Vikings with a sense of personal identity, that's just- relaxing.
We're all gonna die tomorrow.
Michael, I have some bad news.
- I just found out I have B.H.D. - B.H.D.?
Yeah.
Brittle Hair Disease.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow and get all my hair shaved off.
- So you'll be- - Bald, Michael.
B-A-L-D, no hair, shiny head, bald.
And my hair won't ever grow back either.
Will you still love me when I'm bald?
You could wear a wig.
So, Michael, are you saying that you would not love me if I didn't have a luscious, full-bodied head of hair?
Oh!
No, Jackie.
I would love you even more.
You know, I would shave off my hair and paste it to your head.
Michael, that's beautiful.
Nice job.
Thanks.
That was a test, right?
'Cause bald chicks are gross.
Look at that.
They closed the blinds, so we couldn't see the party.
- But I can hear them.
-  I can hear you, Bob and Midge!
I can hear your party!
Ooh.
Kitty and Red.
We've very busy in here.
Yes, we're very busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.
You're having a party, and you didn't invite us.
And I thought we were friends, and we're not.
And I'll tell you something else.
You're naked.
You have no clothes on.
Why don't you have any clothes on?
Well, we're having a nudist party with our fellow nudists.
We're, uh, nudists.
And we're not.
So, you didn't invite us.
So, thank you.
Come on, Red.
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Kitty.
What are you saying?
You really wanted to attend this party.
- Stop it, Red.
- No, no, no, no.
Now get in there and have yourself a good old naked time, huh?
Who knows?
They might play Twister.
Could be fun.
Okay, guys, they can't be mad at us now.
Yeah, Fez, I don't think that's gonna help.
-  - All right, here they come.
Okay, you guys, here's the plan.
Fez, you beg for mercy in broken English.
Hyde, you insist that this whole thing was a big setup.
And I'll just curl up in the fetal position and think about pancakes.
- Got it.
- Got it.
Oh, my God.
We're in the girls' locker room.
Yeah.
They're girls.
Phew!
And I thought we were going to get beaten up for sure.
Hey, baby.
- Hi, Kelso.
- Hi, Tiffany.
I'm so glad I ran into you.
I've been meaning to ask you something.
- Yeah?
What's that?
- Will you take me back to your house and make out with me?
Well, l-  I don't know.
Yeah, I'm here to meetJackie, so- I promise she'll never find out.
It'd be an afternoon of secret make-out fun.
You can drink grape juice from my belly button.
All right, this has got to be one ofJackie's tests.
I mean, Tiffany never comes on to me.
But what if it's not?
I mean, let's face it, I look good today.
That new conditioner's really working out.
All right, but the real question is, should I risk it?
And my body says yes, and my head says yes but my heart says no.
Aw, my stupid heart's right.
I can't.
I mean, I appreciate the offer and all 'cause you're, like, really hot but the only girl I want to make out with is Jackie, so- Oh, Michael, you did it!
You did it!
You passed the last test!
- Did you believe me, Michael?
- Yeah, sure.
Oh, good, because I'm in drama club, and I really want- Yeah, thank you, Tiffany, bye-bye.
Michael, now I know I can honestly trust you with all my heart.
Ooh!
Um- Jackie Donna told me about the test.
So I knew what was going on, and I didn't say anything.
So maybe I don't deserve to be with you because that wasn't very honest of me.
But telling me that was.
Damn.
You're right.
So you'll take me back?
Yeah, Michael.
I love you, Jackie Burkhart.
I love you too, Michael Kelso.
What the hell happened to you guys?
We got beaten up.
By men.
By big, strong men.
Hey, guys, as I was getting beaten I think I got to second base.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, my first X-rated movie.
I don't know what's going on, but that is the luckiest pizza boy ever.
Yeah, I'll say.
There's at least nine boobs in this shot alone.
Guys, I feel bad.
I mean, Jackie finally takes me back and I reward her by sneaking off to see some trashy porno babes.
Oh, wow!
That seems like it would tickle.
Oh, nothing's going to happen in this scene.
It's just two ladies.
Oh, bravo, nice plot twist.
All right, guys, I gotta go.
I don't thinkJackie would like me being here.
And you should pick up your dress on the way out.
Oh, wow!
Does everyone do that?
Because I don't do that.
I just stick to two or three key moves and- God, they don't even come close to that.
Oh, Eric, I have not done anything but even I, had I done anything, would have already done that.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Jackie, you know I love you and you know how much I've changed, right?
Yeah?
Oh, what'd you do?
I went to a stag film.
But then it turned out that there weren't any stags at all.
It was just naked people having sex.
Go ahead and punish me.
No, Michael, I'm not gonna punish you.
You were honest with me, and honesty should be rewarded.
Wow.
I'm not in trouble and I get a reward?
- Is it a cash reward?
-  No, Michael, the reward is feeling better about yourself.
Oh.
Mmm, smells good.
Whatcha making?
Oh, a little lemon meringue and pot roast and my sister Paula is coming and seven-layer salad.
Ahh.
Seven-lay- Hey, wait a second.
Red, now please, be nice.
We haven't seen her in almost six years.
- Yeah, not since she got arrested.
- No, not arrested, detained.
She showed up in the backseat of a police car with lights flashing.
I had to tell the neighbors that she was the mayor of Cincinnati.
-  - Oh, there she is.
You wait.
She's gonna hit me up for money like she always does.
-  -  That's gonna cost me.
-  Oh, my God.
!
- Kitty!
Oh, my God!
Look at you!
I know, I know, I'm fabulous.
- Look, huh, at me.
- Oh, my God.
You're wearing stockings.
Red, she's wearing stockings.
Oh, oh, and matching shoes!
Oh, come on, Red.
I know you're dying for a nibble.
Paula, you're so pink.
Oh, well, sure, sure.
I gotta match my brand-new car.
Go ahead, pet her.
Well, ooh, ooh, I wanna pet her too.
Why did you paint it with Pepto-Bismol?
It's not Pepto-Bismol.
It's Luscious Blushes.
And only the top Kathy May salesperson gets one of these babies.
So you stole it from her?
I have all the money that I owe you.
Here it is.
Oh, my God.
You have cash.
Red, she has cash.
Honey, Red, Red, Red, really, you don't have to count it.
Oh, well, of course.
You're family.
Oh, honey, honey, honey!
Honesty's cool, man.
It's like I can do anything wrong and then ask for forgiveness, and then I'm good again.
I mean, someone should invent a religion like that.
Okay, so did anyone besides me think that some of the guys in that movie were not completely average?
Like, you know, they were way, way above average?
Well, you don't go into that line of work when you're below average.
You just pray some hot, redheaded neighbor girl likes you for your personality.
What are you talking about?
Those men were completely average.
In fact, I found the guy with the mustache downright puny.
See now, Fez, that's not honest.
I mean, we all know you're small in the pants.
What I'm saying is, is from here on in, I'm only telling the truth.
In fact, I'm gonna come clean toJackie about everything.
Fine.
You want honesty?
I'll give you honesty.
We are all small in the pants.
Kelso, this might be your best idea ever.
You know what?
You should make a list of all the lies you've ever told toJackie, and I'll help you.
'Cause all's I really want is for you to be happy.
Hey, you guys, honestly you don't think Donna's, you know, bored, right?
'Cause those guys in the movie, they didn't do the same move twice.
And I've done the same move, like always.
I'll bet they go to a special school or something.
I mean, they're like doctors at doing it.
Eric, dinner.
Oh, no.
Now I have to act normal.
But I get to eat, yeah!
- Aunt Paula, you look great.
- Oh.
And so pink.
Oh, Eric, you're so cute.
Here's 20 bucks.
Aunt Paula is awesome!
So, Paula, tell me more about the ship captain.
Oh, that was just a fling, you know.
Didn't you have a fiancé the last time we saw you?
Red, now there is no reason to rehash ancient history, is there?
No, it's okay.
It turned out he lived on some sort of commune where everyone called him God.
And there were- there were guns.
And I really could never figure out why God would need a gun.
But there were some fun parties.
Whoo!
That's hilarious!
Life has gotten so much better since I moved to Indianapolis.
I mean, things move so much faster in the big city.
One day you're wondering if you'll ever find happiness and the next, you're waving the starting flag at the Indy 500.
- You waved the Indy flag?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, God, you're the coolest.
Mom, how funny is it that while Aunt Paula was at Indy you were probably at, like, Price Mart.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, who wants pie?
It's meringue.
Well, enough about me.
Kitty, dear, what have you been up to?
Well, you know, it's funny you should ask because we have been super, super busy.
Oh, no, she quit her job.
She's not up to anything.
It's kind of boring.
So, did you meet Dick Trickle?
Eric!
What?
He's a race car driver.
His name is Dick Trickle.
Oh, my God, listen to my voice!
I'm so loud!
Oh, well, will you look at this?
Here's me, captain of the cheerleaders.
"Most likely to succeed".
"Best laugh".
Oh, here's Paula.
What's that on her cheek?
Oh, she had a little sledding accident with her face that year.
- Typical.
- I know.
Things were so different then.
Kitty, oh!
You so deserve this.
You're the best.
Oh, aren't you sweet?
Boy, oh, boy, Chet sure is lucky.
He's got the keenest girl in school.
Oh, stop!
- Congratulations, Kitty.
- Thanks, Paula.
I knew you'd win.
You always do.
- No, not always.
- Well, I want a kiss from the queen.
Well, Chet, you have been an awfully loyal subject.
You guys, I'd like you to meet my date, Marvin.
Marvin?
Sweetie?
Sweetie?
Okay.
Okay.
And now, I'm a housewife and she goes on cruises with Dick Trickle.
You don't know what she's not telling you.
I mean, just because she's more successful than you doesn't mean that she's happy.
More successful?
Well, it's just that she has so many- And she's- she's very-  Look, money.
I love it when you do that.
Good to know.
Good to know.
And how about when I do this?
Geez, Eric, what the hell?
Okay, okay, I'll just go back up to the ear.
Get away from me, you pig!
Where are my pants?
- Wait.
Wait, it was an accident.
-  Look, I have a feather.
He did?
What the heck for?
I don't know.
In like what universe is that sexy?
Only one- the skinny, pervert universe.
It was just so strange.
I mean, usually he just sticks to, like, two or three key moves.
You know, I bet it's because of that nudie flick they saw yesterday.
They went to an X-rated movie?
Didn't Eric tell you?
No.
God, why would Eric go see something like that?
I mean, is our sex life so boring that he has to sneak around and watch other people do it?
Donna, of course it is.
It's okay.
So, um, what's going on here?
Packing a picnic lunch for your next African safari?
No, I thought I'd make my strudel for the boys.
It feels nice having people to cook for.
Huh.
Well, um- Sounds like your, uh jet-set life gets pretty lonely, huh?
- Oh, no, I have lots of friends.
- Oh, right, right.
But, um, all the friends in the world don't make up for having to come home from the Bahamas to an empty house, do they?
I actually enjoy my privacy.
Hmm, privacy.
Loneliness.
It's a fine line, isn't it?
Okay, Kitty, is something wrong?
Yeah, something is wrong.
Why are you here?
Because I missed you.
And I wanted you to see that I'm finally okay.
Okay or better than me?
Better than you?
Oh, Kitty, you're my sister and- Fine.
I'm finally a success, and I wanted to come back and rub your face in it.
And I did, and I liked it!
Well, good for you.
It must have been hard living in my shadow, because I was popular and you weren't.
And I had a life and you didn't.
That's right.
I said it.
You heard me.
You were a schlub.
A schlub!
Oh, I am so sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry too.
Oh, I just- I don't know what is the matter with me.
- I know.
- I should be just thrilled that you're finally on your feet, and instead, I'm just- I'm acting like a jealous little ninny.
Kitty, would you like a makeover?
Oh, I really would.
Okay.
L-I won't look like a whore, will I?
No, no, I promise.
Okay, Jackie.
There are some things I haven't been honest about that I feel like you should know.
Okay.
Why are they here?
Well, Hyde helpfully pointed out that it's not really honesty unless your friends are allowed to watch.
So, anyway, I made a list.
The list was my idea.
Thank you for that, Hyde.
Okay, so let's just get started.
Um, that picture you saw of me in kindergarten?
Those weren't puffy pants.
It was a big boy diaper.
And that time you came out of the shower, and you thought you saw a flash?
I did take your picture.
This one time you asked me if you had anything in your teeth?
And you did, but I said no, 'cause it's funnier that way.
When we were about to fool around, and I said that I washed my hands?
But really I just got done playing with like six dogs.
- But that's not as bad- - All right, Michael, stop!
Okay, Michael, I think we need to work on selective honesty.
Yes, that and basic hygiene.
Seriously, good God, man.
Okay, Michael unless one of your secrets involves kissing a girl, I don't need to know about it.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, science fact.
Dogs are cleaner than humans.
Oh, you poor pink bastard.
Well, well.
!
What have we here?
All right.
I got 20 minutes till my wife comes back so, uh, pucker up.
Okay, you two lovebirds.
I'm off.
Oh, bye-bye, Red.
Oh!
Oh, Paula, thank you so much.
Oh, oh, Kitty.
What are sisters for, huh?
I'll talk to you in a couple of days.
And you remember what I said.
Oui, oui, ma soeur.
-  - So what's with all the French?
- Did she call me something?
- No.
She said, "Search for life to live life," which is my new motto.
Paula made me see that I have been in a rut.
But the good news is, from now on, I am just going to explore life.
But you're- You're all pretty now with your big red lips.
Isn't that enough?
Oh, I love you, Red Forman.
And no.
All right, fine.
But if you paint my car pink, it's over.
Oh, hey, I was just looking at- Hey!
Okay, where did you get the idea to do what you did?
I went to see this movie and it was a- Well, I guess you could call it an art film.
- Eric!
- Okay, fine, Donna.
It was an X-rated film.
And it just- There were all these people and they were doing all these things that we've never done.
And it seemed like they really enjoyed doing this one thing especially.
And I just thought, you know, who would enjoy doing that one thing especially?
My lady.
Eric, listen to me because this is gosh-darn important.
You don't do that, not without asking.
So, if I had asked- The answer's still no!
Are you bored with our sex life?
Oh, God, no.
Just the opposite.
I figured that you had to be bored.
And it was our hundredth time, and I just wanted to do something special.
Oh, my God, you count?
No.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
But do me a favor.
Next time you're gonna do something weird gimme a little more warning, so I can brace myself.
Or tell you to back the hell off.
- Right.
- Because no matter how much I love you that was unpleasant.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I can't hang out.
I gotta go meetJackie.
Don't look at me like that.
All right, five more minutes, but that is it.
Come on.
Who wants to show me their belly, huh?
Come on.
Come here, buddy!
Come here, baby.
Who's my little baby, huh?
Who's my little baby?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
So, everyone enjoying dinner?
-  - Good.
Now, um, I want to talk to everyone about helping me with the church fund-raiser.
Freeze.
Okay, so-  God's Magic Circle is our church's women's auxiliary and I volunteered to help organize their next fund-raiser.
And bravo, I say.
Bra vo.
Now, if you'll please excuse me, I have to attend a meeting.
It's, uh- It's very important, so- Okay.
Now, as you all know, um, I'm stuck in a rut.
And, um, I'd really- l-I just need to get out of the house and-and experience new things.
- But, Mom, I think you should- - And I want your support which, by the way, I always give you Mr. "I want to be a jazz guitarist".
Eric, if your mother wants you and Archie and Jughead here to help her then you're going to help her.
- You'reJughead.
-  You'reJughead.
- You're soJughead, it's not even debatable.
- You are so- Ow!
Steven, stop hitting Jughead.
- See?
- Hey.
This is important to her and we should support her for this.
So you guys'll help out.
Well, thank you, Red.
And you're coming too.
Oh, no, Kitty.
I, uh- I have a meeting.
With you at church.
- Nice save, Dad.
- Shut up.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
No, see, Fez, Bazooka Joe wanted to see time fly so Mort threw the clock out the window.
So time flew.
Get it?
Did the clock break?
I don't know.
That's not really the point.
It's still a pretty big waste of a clock.
Okay.
Well, I gotta go.
- See you later, sweetie.
- See you.
You guys are such a cute couple.
- Yeah, I know.
I really like Caroline.
- Me too.
She's nice.
For a psycho.
Hyde, take that back.
Psycho.
You are a gifted mime.
But that hurts.
Hyde, Caroline's not a psycho.
You just don't get women.
We have emotions.
We're ruled by the moon and the tides.
And pretty clothes.
Yeah, we should hang out with her, you know, make her feel welcome.
Yeah, you can never have too many friends.
Sometimes you feel like a nut; sometimes you don't.
Hey, you guys, you know who was crazy?
This camp counselor I once had who used to make everyone do turbo sit-ups.
But he'd put a towel over your face, and then when you went to do the sit-up- He'd pull the towel away, and you'd have to put your face in his butt.
Donna, you stole the funny part.
Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Tell the story again.
I'll laugh.
But it'll be fake though, right?
Oh, yeah.
- Okay, guys, I once had this camp counselor- -  Oh, my God, you guys.
The Petersons just got a new dog.
Let's go!
Okay, now, I have work assignments for everyone.
- Red, you're selling raffle tickets.
- I'm your man.
And don't yell at the customers.
I'm kinda your man.
- And smile.
- You need another man.
Okay, Michael, Steven, you're in charge of bingo.
And, Eric, I thought you could run the cakewalk.
Sure.
What's cakewalk?
It's cake and walking.
What are you, on dope?
So, uh, Pastor Dave, what do you think?
Gosh, Kitty, I'm impressed.
I can't remember the last time a God's Magic Circle fund-raiser looked so gosh darn wonderful.
Hiya, gang.
Hi, Pastor Dave.
Say, God's Magic Circle-That sounds like an Eric Clapton song, doesn't it, kids?
Yes, Pastor Dave.
Rock on, kids.
Rock on, Pastor Dave.
Come on, string bean.
Will you stop the record already?
Hey, I'm in charge.
I'll stop it when I'm good and ready.
And that's not because of you.
It's just 'cause I was ready.
Okay, congratulations, Ed.
You win a chocolate cake.
But I'm allergic to chocolate.
Then why are you in the cakewalk, Ed?
I thought this was the line for the bathroom.
Now, don't you screw this up.
I want that marmalade cake.
Sure, yeah, all right, pumpkin.
I was just talking to this guy over here- Oh, just forget it.
You're gonna screw it up.
You always do.
Just go stand over there.
All right, my turtle dove.
Right over here.
For the love of God, let my wife win the cake.
Well, it's in the hands of the Lord now, sir.
Okay, everyone, get ready for another exciting round of cakewalk.
-  - Would you believe she was once the sweetest most beautiful girl in high school?
Of course she was.
A word of advice, kid.
Never marry your high school sweetheart.
Why not?
Oh, that's it, Glen.
Just keep slouching.
- You're not mousy enough.
- That's why.
-  -  Hot as a Pistol.
!
Boy, did I take thesejerks to the cleaners.
!
Hey!
That's a craps table.
Yep.
Except here it's called "cripes".
Would you like to be the next holy roller?
Are you kidding?
Next to prayer, craps is my favorite thing about church.
Well, enjoy yourself.
I gotta go check out the Last Supper bake sale.
Free cupcakes for anyone who doesn't deny the Lord!
We gotta win the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
These are the most technologically advanced of all the plastic, spring-loaded boxing robots.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Or we could cheat.
Kelso, man, you're willing to cheat?
Here in the house of the Lord?
You're coming along nicely.
Yeah, I mean, it's not that bad.
Because technically we're only in the basement of the Lord.
And I'll bet he never comes down here.
Yeah, good point.
Plus what old lady wants Rock'em Sock'em Robots or a box of Pop Rocks or a SuperBall?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, they could hurt themselves.
You give the elderly Pop Rocks, and they could get all foamy and stroke out.
- So we're helping.
- We're helping.
B-7.
Bingo!
Gosh, that's lucky.
- That's Donna.
- Oh, look at that.
A carrot top, huh?
Ah, that's great, kid.
Just great.
You know, I was a lot like you- a milky-white loser with a cheap haircut and less muscle tone than a canned ham.
Okay, first of all, Glen I'm wiry, okay?
Yeah, I was dating the hottest looking girl in the school.
Thought I had it made.
- So what happened?
- I don't know really.
One day we just realized that she had heard all of my stories and I had heard all of her stories and, well, that's when she stopped being nice and started eating.
Oh, God, Donna eats.
Better watch it there, kid.
It starts small.
A few wise-ass comments, and then they're puttin' you down in front of your friends.
Donna, you stole the funny part.
Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.
Then before you know it, you're praying for death.
Either hers or yours.
Either way, at least it's quiet.
You really brought me down, man.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do that.
You guys are so much fun to hang out with.
We really are.
So what does Cosmo say about me?
I'm a Gemini.
Um, okay, the twins.
Two people trapped in one body.
So you're like a split personality.
If you ever say that again, I'll kill you.
I'm kidding.
You guys, I'm psycho, remember?
Whoo-hoo!
Wow, that was- that was really good.
I almost wet myself.
All right.
All right.
Enough small talk.
- So, is Fez, like, an amazing kisser?
- Jackie, don't make me blush.
No, she's only asking because when she kissed him, he did this thing with his tongue.
- You kissed Fez?
- Oh, my God.
It was so nothing.
He had this stupid crush on me.
Shut up!
If either of you ever touch my boyfriend I will hunt you down like animals.
Understand?
You're kidding, right?
You're kidding, right!
I'll scratch your big, dumb eyes out!
Got it?
Oh, my God.
I know.
Her nails are beautiful.
I just wanted to thank you once again for doing such a wonderful job, Kitty.
Well, I'll tell you, Pastor Dave it feels so good to get out of the house and do something important.
You know who else got out of the house and did something important?
Jesus.
And lucky for us he did.
Are you all right?
Well, I ran out of underwear, and I'm wearing my swimsuit, and, uh- I've said too much.
Eric?
I'm the richest man in church!
Fellas, these dice like me.
Whoa!
Oh, yeah!
B-l-N-G-O!
And that spells losers.
Losers.
Damn it!
Never marry your high school sweetheart.
- Oh, hey, did I tell you- - Heard it!
Who ate the last doughnut?
I did.
Son of a bitch.
You ate the first 11!
Oh, shut up!
No, I won't.
I weigh 80 pounds.
Look at you!
Do you know why I'm bald?
My body is eating its own hair!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Hey, Diamond Jim, come here.
How's the abandoned raffle going?
Kitty, I'm on fire.
I just rolled four hard eights in a row!
God is bending the laws of probability just for me.
Hey.
We won everything.
Yeah, we're just supernaturally lucky.
Hey, Mom, I got some bad, bad news for you.
For every one doughnut I get, Donna gets 11.
Storm's a-brewin'.
Eric, how could you leave the cakewalk?
Just look at those people.
- Kitty, how's everything going?
- Just great.
Everything's great.
You kids buy a raffle ticket?
Third prize is a rock and roll record.
John Denver's Greatest Hits.
He fills up your senses.
I ask for one day of help, and this is what I get?
Um, yeah.
Oh, wonderful.
I started out in-in God's Magic Circle and ended up in Satan's Evil Square.
I can't believe any of you can walk into a church without bursting into flames.
- Kitty, we're- - Okay, you know what?
Just forget it.
Just go.
And please leave your ill-gotten gains.
I won them.
They're mine.
- Hi, Mom.
We're sorry.
- Very sorry.
- Welcome home.
- I love you so much.
Okay, you know what?
Just stop.
- I'm not mad at you.
- You're not?
No.
On my way home, while dreaming about being married to someone else and having his children I, um- I realized that this is all my fault.
All right!
Hold on.
This may be a trap.
No.
I shouldn't have forced you to come with me when what I really wanted was just- just to do something for myself.
Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.
And if there's anything that you wanna do from now on you should go and do it if it makes you happy.
And we'll support you by not going with you.
Would that be good?
Yes.
Thank you, Red.
Good.
You're welcome.
Wow.
You and Mom.
You were-You were fighting, and then you just made up.
And you guys have been married for like a million years.
It fills my heart with hope.
That's it.
You're going in the army.
She was scary.
Really scary.
Okay, Exorcist scary.
Fez, you have to break up with her.
Okay, you two are overreacting.
She is a little loony, but she wouldn't hurt you.
Hey.
Hello, my sweet girlfriend.
We've been over this!
Caroline!
Touch Fez and die!
- Stop it!
These are my friends!
- Oh, really?
Did they shoplift 30 dollars' worth of indelible ink markers and write your name on every inch of their room?
Every inch!
Did they?
Um, did you guys do that?
- No.
- No.
Well, there you have it.
Um, Caroline, I have to break up with you.
Why?
And don't say it's because I'm crazy.
Because I'm not crazy.
Oh, no.
Oh- Oh, no.
Of cour- Of course not.
It's just, um- It's just, um- - Donna and I are in love.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- Ewww!
Yes, we are freaky for each other.
Please tell her.
Please.
What if she tries to kill me?
You're a giant.
You can take her.
Oh, my God.
You're really breaking up with me?
Is that okay?
Fez, I just want to say that you will never be as happy as you were with me!
Ever.
And until you realize that, I'll be seeing you.
And by "I'll be seeing you," I mean that I'll be watching you.
But you won't know it.
Except I just told you, so you do know it.
Anyway, this isn't over!
Whew.
Sure am glad that's over.
One, two, three, go!
Damn it.
Damn it.
All right, mine's broken.
Did- Robots are stupid.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
-  -   That is the saddest sound in the world.
No more soda for Fez.
And no more money for- - Fez, do you need me to buy you another soda?
- Eric, you do not buy soda.
You only rent it.
You know what I mean.
I mean, you pee it out.
Yeah, I got it.
Go.
Well, I'll have to remember that phone number.
- Hi, Fez!
- Caroline!
What are you doing?
I knew you'd be in here.
I saw you had the large root beer.
- Caroline, you have to leave me alone.
- But I wanna be with you!
But I told you we're through because I am with Donna.
Yes?
Remember?
Donna?
Well, you'd better be, because if you're not that means you still love me.
And if you still love me but you're not with me, I'll make you pay.
That would only be scary if I was lying about Donna and me.
Well, if you are lying I'll know, because I'll be watching you.
Go ahead.
I'm not afraid.
Oh, Eric, I'm afraid.
What's wrong?
When I broke up with crazy Caroline, I told her I was dating Donna.
But I'm not dating Donna.
You are dating Donna.
Hey!
Could I borrow Donna?
Sure.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
I don't wanna blink, 'cause I'm afraid to miss even a second of your cuteness.
I know.
It's torture for me too.
I could tear your eyelids off.
Let's go, Michael, to a place where our love is understood.
Oh, hey, while you're there check out the new monkey house.
It never ends with those two.
I love you, I love you, I love you-  Guys, it won't last.
Look, an object in an unnatural state must return to its natural state.
Thus, Kelso and Jackie'll have a fight any day.
Really?
It's simple physics.
Hey, you guys, you know what?
We should get a pool going.
We'll draw days for five bucks.
If they fight on your day, you win the pot.
The pot?
If that's the prize, I am in.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Donna, I can't thank you enough for agreeing to helPme with Caroline.
Hey, anything for a friend.
But if she tries to hurt me, I'm using you as a shield.
Likewise.
So, while you're with Fez, looks like Forman'll be living the single life.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Oh, now you won't get to take me to see The Turning Point.
The ballerina movie?
Oh, no.
Need somethin', Bob?
Well, it's a funny thing.
The wife and I, we're taking out a second mortgage on the house.
Well, that's not the funny part 'cause we're pretty much destitute.
It's a little bit funny, Bob.
Anyways I'm looking at the deed to the property and the map shows that I own a couple feet of your driveway and a little bit of your garage.
How'd you like to own a little bit of my foot in your ass?
I wouldn't, to be quite honest.
It's free.
So, our first date.
I guess we're officially a couple now.
A couple of knuckleheads, huh?
May we laugh.
- Oh!
There she is.
- Okay.
Showtime.
-  -       Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, should I watch a ballerina movie or Get Smart?
-  - Get Smart it is.
That's right.
I said Get Smart.
I'm sorry, Donna.
Did you want the last piece?
Well, it's too late.
That's right.
I said too late.
Yeah, that was me.
That's right.
That was me.
Hey, Hyde!
Welcome to the bachelor life.
You know, without Donna I've realized that I can revert to my natural state.
I'm dirty, I'm lazy and I don't wear pants.
- I'm just like you.
- No, no.
See, I'm an original.
A Warhol.
You're just a print.
Those are some pretty strong words coming from a guy who's wearing pants.
Wait.
This is my favorite part.
Oh, yeah, that was me.
That's right.
That was me.
!
Bob, that's my stuff!
You put the hell back my stuff!
Sorry, Red.
It was in my part of the garage.
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?
Kitty- Kitty, let me talk to him.
Bob, get the hell out of my garage!
Fine.
There ya go.
Hey.
Hey, how goes the pool?
Great.
I sold 15 spots.
I got today.
You got tomorrow.
What?
That bites.
They're never gonna last until then.
Who won't last until what?
- What?
Huh?
- Huh?
What?
Oh.
Oh.
I, uh- I smashed a couple of toes.
We're waiting to see how long before the nails fall off.
I wanna play.
Uh, Michael, you're a little busy right now.
But, Jackie, those toenails could fall off at any minute.
Hey!
Me!
I'm sorry, puddin'.
All right.
Now I feel like pudding.
Hey!
Me too!
Let's go.
Well, I believe this is mine.
Thank you all for playing.
What?
That wasn't a fight.
Okay, we'll let Fez decide.
Fez, fight or no?
Sorry, Eric.
I have to say no.
- The pool goes on.
- But, Fez, l- It goes on.
Ah, what the hell?
Now I want pudding.
I'm with you, brother.
Let's roll.
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.
No, no.
Don't get all gussied up for me.
I just came by to make sure you're okay.
You know, not too lonely without me.
What, are you kidding me?
I'm having a great time!
L- I feel like I've really learned a lot about Eric.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad you're having fun.
Oh, but what about you?
Pretending to be Fez's girlfriend has to be kind of a drag.
Right?
No!
Fez is great.
Last night he took me to play putt-putt.
And tonight he's taking me on a hayride.
Fez is so charming.
You know, I can see why Caroline's stalking him.
- You know, I would've taken you on a hayride- - Eric, Eric.
The important thing is that you're having a great time, and I'm having a great time.
So have a great time.
No, you have a great time.
Oh, I will.
Well, I will too.
Eric, I cannot thank you enough for lending me your girlfriend.
It feels so good to be in a normal, healthy relationship.
Fez, it's a fake, pretend relationship.
You say tomato, I say tomato.
Fez, "to-mah-to".
What?
You say "to-mah-to".
Why would I say "to-mah-to"?
That's not even a word, dummy.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Eric.
Different strokes for different strokes.
Right.
All I know is, if I was married to a woman like Donna it would be heavens.
Oh, the high jinks we would get into.
Lucy, I'm home!
Ricky, is that you?
Lucy, what happened to you?
Oh, Ricky, I was making molasses cookies for your band and I had an accident!
Oh, Lucy.
- Uh-oh.
- Ricky!
- We're stuck!
-  I'll get it.
Ayayayayay.
!
Hi, neighbors!
Lucy, I brought you that flour for your cookies.
Oh, Ethel, you're a pal!
Gee, Fred, would it hurt you to hug me like that?
Well, probably not.
But why take the chance?
Hey, Fred, we got a sticky situation here.
You wanna help us out?
Sure, Rick.
Watch it, Fred!
Boy, you kids really are stuck.
Waaaaah!
Waaaaah!
Waaaaah!
Oh, Lucy.
Well, I'm off to romance our lady.
Oh- Hey, Fez, Donna hasn't been I don't know, like, mentioning me or anything?
No.
Well, that- that's okay.
That's good, 'cause I haven't been talking about her either.
Of course, I've been alone, so I'd just be talking to myself.
And that's not normal.
Have to be pretty crazy to talk to myself, wouldn't I?
Yes.
Yes, I would.
Okay, I gotta get some pants.
Damn.
Oh, hey, Kelso, uh Pam Macy called and she said she had a really great time making out with you last night.
- Michael!
- No!
No!
We did not!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
- No fair, man.
- Shut up!
- My day's almost over!
Now, hurry up and fight!
- What?
-  - Oh, no!
- Would you watch it!
- Isn't Kelso a klutz?
I think you should hit him.
Steven, why are you trying to make us fight?
'Cause I've got today in the pool.
Come on, Jackie, hit him!
Oh, my God.
I get it.
The pool wasn't about Steven's toenails.
These idiots bet on when you and I would fight.
Kelso!
Are you gonna take that, man?
She called your friends idiots.
You better start kickin' some ass!
No, wait.
The pool was about us?
Damn!
I wish I had a piece of that!
You would wager against our love?
Well, damn, Jackie!
In a lifetime, how often do you have a run at a sure thing?
-  - Game over!
-  - What's all the racket?
Oh, that's just the sweet sound of me winning 75 bucks.
Aha.
!
Not so fast, cheater.
!
It's two minutes past midnight, which means it's the next day, which means you lose.
Ah!
Serves you right.
- Yeah.
- Oh, shut up, Michael.
Looks like the winner is "R.F." Who's R.F.?
I believe this is mine.
Thank you all very much.
All right, hand over my preserves.
They were in our garage, and now they're not.
Oh, that's terrible, Kitty.
Why don't you sit down and relax with some toast and homemade jam?
- Jam?
- Yeah.
We found it in our garage.
It's our garage!
And that's my jam!
Bon aPPétit.
!
You know, you two just don't get it, do you?
That jam was on my property.
I'll show you the deed.
There's my lot.
There's yours.
There's the property line right there.
Oops.
Well-  Looks like I own part of your property.
I, uh- I will not stand for this trickery!
You get out of my house!
No problem.
-  - Okay.
No one answered the phone at Eric's house.
What could he be doing?
Where could he go with no pants?
Donna, when we're in public, you are with me.
Eric is dead to you.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Move it!
Oh, boy.
Here comes trouble.
Caroline.
I was just offering my girlfriend Donna a sip from my straw.
We don't care about germs, because she has had her tongue in my mouth.
You know what I think?
I think this is all an act.
I don't think you're really dating.
Oh, yeah?
Well-Well, maybe- maybe this will convince you.
Come on, Donna.
Put some leg into it.
Give me a break.
If you were really together, you'd have at least gotten to second base by now.
You know, when you are right, you are right.
All right, all right.
Enough.
Caroline, Fez doesn't like you.
Is that true, Fez?
Yes.
Wow.
I guess we really are over.
Okay!
Enjoy your movie.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Hey, Eric.
Lookin' good.
Call me.
Eric, what are you doing here?
Are you kidding me?
It's The Turning Point.
I love ballet movies.
They make you think, you know?
How did their feet get so pointy?
That's a mystery I'm determined to solve.
- What?
- You miss me.
Well you missed me.
I really did.
Excuse me.
Our date is not over.
Now, good day, sir.
- But, Fez- - I said good day.
Fez, I'm not going anywhere.
Fine.
Then good day.
-  Fez!
- I said good day!
Lucy, these brownies are wonderful.
They make me feel silly.
Don't you just love those dried mint flakes?
Someone sold 'em to me off the street!
Um, I don't think these are mint flakes.
I'm flyin'!
Lucy, you got some 'splainin' to do.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What you doing?
- Oh, just writing in my journal.
Like in Star Trek?
Captain's log, stardate 1978.
God, I'm so hot.
My beautiful red hair and giant jugs seem to drive all life-forms wild.
Oh, my God, Eric.
That's exactly what I was writing.
I'm gonna go make some popcorn and get some sodas.
My beautifully sculpted hindquarters flounce downstairs to procure nourishment.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Eric.
Eric.
Yes, Donna's journal?
I am the book of secrets, Eric.
Don't you wanna know what she really thinks about you?
Read me.
Read me.
You know, I really shouldn't.
Suit yourself.
But beware- what you learn here cannot be unlearned.
Okay, do you want me to read you or not?
Sorry.
Eric and I went to second base tonight.
He was hilarious.
The Prom is gonna be magical.
I think tonight I'm Finally gonna sleeP with Eric.
Which is like Woodstock, but for vans.
Anyway, I think I'm Finally gonna sleeP with Eric.
I love him so much.
Tonight I'm Finally gonna sleeP with Eric.
Okay, let's just skip to the last page.
I had the weirdest dream about Eric last night.
He was Eric, but he was also Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and he looked really wicked and dangerous.
Yeah!
Wicked and dangerous.
Which is so not Eric.
Sometimes I wish he were like that.
Quick!
Put me down!
Someone's coming!
Hi!
Hello.
How are you?
I didn't do anything.
You look pretty.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hey!
Glad you're back.
I missed you so.
- Did you read my journal?
- What journal?
You know, my captain's log.
No.
Oh!
No.
I was just, uh- I was, uh, going through your underwear drawer.
Yeah.
I know.
That's why I look so guilty.
Because I was, like, you know taking out your underwear and rubbing it against my skin.
I can't stay away from your underwear.
That's my curse.
So, anyway, see you tomorrow.
Gong him.
Gong him!
Gong him!
Yes!
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.
What, Michael?
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.
- What?
What isn't gonna work?
- I'm sorry, but you and l- - They're here!
They're here!
- What?
What?
- Oh, my God!
Michael, what'd you say?
- Huh?
I said, "What"?
My X-ray specs are here.
According to the ad in the Richie Rich comic with these, you can see through a lady's clothes.
Okay, Jackie, prepare to be ogled.
Swindled again.
Kitty, where's the Band-Aids?
I cut my thumb with a hacksaw.
Oh, Red, you know those things are dangerous.
Well, I tried cutting the metal pipe with a flower but it was real slow going.
Well, seeing as how you're being all snarky anyway may as well tell you, Pastor Dave is coming to dinner tonight.
Not tonight!
There's a Packer RePort on tonight.
They're doing a tribute to Vince Lombardi.
Red, you know I'm trying to get more involved with the church, so he is coming.
Kitty, if Pastor Dave comes over, we'll never get rid of him.
He'll just go on and on about how great God is.
Well, he is.
He said, "This isn't going to work, Jackie".
What if Michael secretly wants to break up?
I need to get him to sleep again.
What if his unconscious mind knows something his conscious mind doesn't?
Well, let's hope so.
At least he's not as boring as Eric.
We're not talking about Eric.
We're talking about Kelso.
Untrustworthy, two-timing, sneaks-around- behind-your-back-and-reads-your-journal Kelso.
Okay, Donna, I'm sensing we're not talking about me and Michael anymore so bye!
Ow!
Don't pinch me, you lumberjack!
Jackie, I think Eric read my private journal.
Oh.
Is this about the dream where you wished Eric was Steven Tyler?
Hey, do you know who I really love?
- Jesus.
- Well, yes.
But I was going to say Vince Lombardi.
- You're a Packer man?
- Are you kidding?
I bleed cheese.
Well, I'm not sure, but I think there may be a Packer RePort on tonight.
Red, I think you might be right.
I think it could start in eight and a half minutes.
Then what do you say we choke our dinners down, get our asses on the couch?
Amen!
Red, can you help me in the kitchen, please?
Right now, please?
Red, this night is not about football.
This night is about company.
And our company wants to watch the Packer RePort.
He spends his life doing the Lord's work and if you would deny this holy little man that simple pleasure well, God have mercy on your soul.
Just can it, Red.
Bring him his food.
You got six minutes.
I'm eating!
- Where is your Band-Aid?
- Oh, I don't know.
I had it on a second ago.
Must have come off while I was serving the-  Done!
Hey, Leo, thanks for letting us hang out here.
I just- I didn't want to see Donna after what she wrote.
Forman, no one cares.
That's true, man.
Listen, you guys know I don't allow alcohol in my house so you're just gonna have to drink sake instead.
"Sake" it to me, Leo.
Don't start with the sake jokes, Fez.
Oh, put a "sake" in it.
Well, this would be fun if I wasn't so miserable.
Look, Forman, we're happy to sit here and drink these tiny allegedly alcoholic drinks but we don't wanna hear you bitch about Donna all night.
Oh.
Don't worry, Hyde.
I don't feel like talking about Donna.
You see, the thing about Donna is- Here we go.
She acts like everything's all cool, okay?
And then, all of a sudden I'm no Steven Tyler.
Oh, Eric, give it up, for heaven's "sake".
You're still the king, man.
Man, I thought we were past the phase where we had to impress each other.
You are.
Now you're in the she-dumps-you- for-a-biker-with-a-wicked-tattoo phase.
The most entertaining of all phases.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Hyde!
That's it!
A tattoo's dangerous!
There's a place next to the liquor store.
I could go get one right now.
No way, man.
We're not gonna let you go to some sleazy tattoo parlor and spend money for something you'll regret for the rest of your life.
I'll tattoo you for free, man.
I'm pretty sure I used to do this for a living.
-  - How cool am I?
A tattoo of my girlfriend's name.
How's that for dangerous?
Yeah, I think Debbie's really gonna like this.
Wait.
Debbie?
No.
Donna.
Right.
Okay.
No problem.
- I can fix it.
- Fix what?
Relax.
Debbie will never notice it.
It's Donna.
See, now you moved, man!
It's okay.
I can make that into a flower.
Oh, you know what you should get?
Boobs.
Big boobs on your butt.
That's classy.
Hey, I can turn the B's into boobs.
Wait.
What B's?
Like in Debbie, your girlfriend?
It's Donna!
Oh, right.
Oh, I can fix that.
Hey.
Jackie.
Hey, Michael.
I'm really glad you're here.
Okay!
Time to go to sleep!
Oh, sleep?
Whoa!
I thought we were gonna do it.
Michael, I invited you over for a sleepover not a do-it over.
Okay?
I told you.
We're gonna wait until we're ready.
So, uh, go to sleep.
No, Jackie, I'm not tired.
But, you know I always get tired right after.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me, Michael.
I know!
We'll read out loud.
Yeah!
I'll be Nancy Drew, and you could be her pudgy friend Bess.
Oh, damn it!
I'm always Bess.
And then Bart Starr fakes a handoff to Anderson and finds Dowler in the end zone for the winning touchdown!
Wow, on TV it seemed confusing but with peanuts, it's all so clear.
- Can I see you in the kitchen for a minute, please?
- Yeah, just one second.
You go ahead and set 'em up again, and I'll show you how the Packers won the Ice Bowl.
All right!
Okay, Red, don't you think it's time your little friend went home?
Kitty, I'm just being sociable, like you asked.
- Just being a good host.
- Oh, sure.
All good hosts feed their guests Band-Aids.
Band-Aid, Kitty.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, my God!
Hospital, please.
"And Nancy Drew and Bess left the police station and went to celebrate the solving of the crime with hot fudge sundaes".
The end.
Wow.
Nancy's so smart.
Read another one.
Fine.
Okay, Nancy Drew and the Mysterious Charming Clock.
"And they celebrated the solving of the mystery of the clock with hot fudge sundaes".
The end.
Guess we solved the mystery of why Bess was so pudgy.
This isn't going to work, Jackie.
What isn't going to work?
I can't sleep with you staring at me.
Eric, how did you get so hot?
I got a tattoo.
Eric's perfect.
Oh, yeah.
Ow.
Ow.
Oh, yeah.
So, are you telling me that you fed me a Band-Aid?
Well, um, to be honest Red fed you the Band-Aid.
How did this happen?
Red, why don't you diagram it for him with peanuts?
Look, Dave, I'm real sorry.
I didn't realize how sick a Band-Aid would make you.
Well, thank you for your belated honesty but the doctor said I had food poisoning from an undercooked sausage.
Food Poisoning?
That's Kitty's dePartment.
I have never undercooked a sausage in my life.
I have a system.
It's foolproof.
Hey, Kitty, it's okay.
We all make mistakes.
L- Vince Lombardi is overrated.
That's right.
He is overrated.
Ignore her.
She's hysterical.
This isn't going to work, Jackie.
Us, Michael?
Are we not gonna work?
No.
The car.
Jackie, the carburetor's busted.
This was all because of a stupid car?
We're gonna have to take the bus to our wedding.
Our wedding?
Oh, Michael.
That is so sweet.
I love you, Michael Kelso.
I love you too, Jackie Onassis.
Eric, what the hell?
Did you just kick my door?
No.
But I got a surprise.
I got a tattoo.
Guess where.
On my butt.
Why?
Why?
Because I'm dangerous, lady.
Eric, I want you to be honest with me, and I promise I won't get mad.
Did you read my journal?
Um, yeah.
You sneaky little dill-hole!
No!
You know who's sneaky?
People who go around writing their feelings in their journals and not telling their boyfriends what they feel.
So, you know what?
I'm not sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You want to know how I feel?
Fine.
I'll tell you how I feel.
"Today at lunch I was looking at Eric when he didn't know it and I just couldn't believe how much I love him and how lucky I am to be with him".
- Why couldn't you read that page?
- Because you came back.
Look, Donna- Look, I'm really sorry, but, you know, it's just sometimes I get worried, you know?
Well, you know what?
Suck it up.
Eric, these are my private thoughts, and I'm allowed to have them.
You have to stop trying to be what you think I want you to be and just, like, be yourself.
- Okay.
I think I'm gonna go.
- Well, wait.
Take off your pants.
Really?
All right.
No.
To show me your tattoo.
- I knew that.
Yeah.
I knew that.
- Right.
Yeah.
I think you're really gonna like it.
Just don't be mad if it says "Debbie".
Woodstock.
It says "Woodstock"?
No, it's a picture of Snoopy's friend Woodstock.
You have a little yellow bird on your ass.
If properly executed the power sweep is unstoppable.
Oh, Red, this is silly.
I don't wanna run this play again.
Well, we're gonna run it until we get it right because, if properly executed the power sweep is unstoppable!
- Hut-one, hut-two.
- Who wants cookies?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Okay, guys.
Road trip checklist.
Car: Check.
Okay.
We're good.
Is there anything about Canada we need to know before we get there?
Well, the beer is stronger, and as a result, their women look prettier.
Then let's haul ass to Canada!
Okay.
Shh.
Fez, if my dad finds out that we're going to Canada uh, for beer, no less, he's gonna start killing people, okay?
People like us.
So keep it down.
All right!
Canada!
Whoo-hoo!
Beer!
- Kelso, you're not going.
- What?
Why not?
Because this is a risky mission.
You tend to screw these things up.
- Yo, that is a damnable lie!
- Okay.
Kelso, remember that time we were gonna put a flaming bag of dog poop in front of Principal Pridwell's door and you lit it in the car on the way over?
Yeah.
I wanted to see it all flame-y.
And then you panicked and stepped on it.
Eric, it was on fire!
Okay.
You're not going.
No, no, no.
Fine.
I won't use the air horn and I'll pay for the gas and the beer.
I can't stay mad at you.
Come on, you big lug.
Hey, dudes.
- Leo, man, what are you doin' here?
- Sittin'.
- What are you doin' here?
- We're goin' to Canada to buy beer.
Canada?
Cool, man.
I spent some time up there during 'Nam.
Oh, conscientious objector, huh?
No.
I didn't mind.
Hey, a road trip sounds good, man.
But I don't want nothin' to do with that beer.
That stuff will mess with your mind, man.
Okay.
Let's get goin'.
Oh, don't tell me Crap Shoes is comin'.
The bag was on fire!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Donna Glamourella Modeling Agency got the pictures I sent in.
They want me to audition!
My dream is finally coming true!
I thought your dream was to be the world's first flying lady scientist.
No.
No, Donna.
That was a dream I had, not my dream.
- You're a weird little girl.
- Yeah.
If I become a model, I wouldn't have to work or study or think ever again!
That's great.
I mean, what's thought done for anyone anyway?
Nothing!
But modeling has made people rich and famous.
Come on, Donna!
We're going to the world modeling headquarters.
It's in Sheboygan.
Guess who got a bonus today?
Oh, my golly.
They gave you a boxful of money.
- Better.
- Ohh.
"A videocassette recorder".
What's videocassette, and why do we need to record it?
It records TV.
You know how we don't get to seeJohnny Carson?
Well, he's on so gosh-darn late.
Who can stay up past 10:30?
No one, but now we can record Johnny while we sleep and then watch it the next day.
- Oh.
- And you know how you wanted to watch the rerun of Roots?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, we can tape it, and then you can watch it over and over.
Well, I think just watching it tonight should do the trick.
Well, we will watch it tonight, after we tape it.
But we don't stay up to watch Carson.
Why would we stay up to watch this?
Because it's conven- Oh, you just don't understand technology.
No.
But I sure know how to tell time.
Wow.
What a view.
Just like a postcard.
It is so beautiful I could cry.
Oh, sure.
Drinking looks like fun.
And all the cool kids do it.
But it leads you down a sad, lonely, confused path, man.
- You know why they call it beer?
- No.
Why?
I'm just curious, man.
Guys, guess how many countries I've whizzed in.
Two.
All right.
Let's get goin'.
We're almost at the border, so everyone's got their I.D.'s, right?
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.
- I think I lost my green card.
- Damn, Fez.
Where's the last place you had it?
If I knew that, I would have it now, you son of a bitch.
- All right, Fez.
Take it easy.
- No.
You take it easy.
They're gonna throw me in Canadian jail.
Have you seen Midnight ExPress?
Well, it's like that, but with hockey sticks.
Great.
Now we're screwed.
- What if I can't breathe?
- Just take a deep breath, man  And visualize yourself breathing.
All right.
Now, when we get to the checkpoint, everyone just act cool.
And by everyone, I mean Mr. Crap Shoes.
It was on fire!
-  Wow.
- Hi.
I'm Michelle Ray President of Glamourella International.
- And you must be?
- I'm Jackie Burkhart.
Jackie Burkhart.
Exactly.
- And you are here for?
- My audition.
Your audition.
Exactly.
- And you must be?
- Yeah.
She doesn't matter.
Okay.
Let's start.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
-  Uh-huh.
Let's see the hair.
- Well, you are a remarkable talent.
-  - Are those your real teeth?
- Yeah.
Great.
Welcome to the superior world of modeling.
- Oh, God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Sure.
Now-  You're going to need to cover a few costs.
Of course.
Oh, you know, I left my checkbook at home.
Um, can I come by tomorrow?
Oh, tomorrow.
No.
No.
Tomorrow I'll be in Paris, you know, for the big show.
Okay.
Then I'll bring it by tonight.
- Good.
Okay.
Administrative costs are 200.
- Uh-huh.
And publicity shots are 150.
And we're gonna need beauty supplies- Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Are you an agent or a saleslady?
Oh, I'm an agent.
I represent models like Cheryl Tiegs.
- You represent Cheryl Tiegs?
- No.
Models like Cheryl Tiegs.
Red, it's starting.
It's starting.
And press "record" and done!
We are now recording.
Two hours from now, we'll be watching Roots.
Well, I just- I just don't see why we can't watch it now like normal people.
Kitty, we have a Betamax.
We're better than normal people.
So, what do you wanna do for the next two hours?
Watch Roots.
-  - Fine.
I'm gonna go make some instant pudding and you can't eat it for two hours.
All right.
Just act cool.
We got nothin' to hide.
You got something to hide, eh?
No, no.
He said, "We've got nothing to hide".
Around here, we don't make a point of saying we've got nothin' to hide if we've really got nothin' to hide.
Wow.
Cultural differences.
Wow.
We're all Americans, every one of us.
- All right.
Move along.
-  Thank you.
- Cool.
-  - Stop right there.
-  Hey, you found me!
You win a beer.
You see, beer is evil.
I'm not gonna say I told you so, man, but I will say this: I told you so, man.
Beer never hurt anyone, my friend.
You're well within the legal limit on that.
But you're over the limit on foreign kids you can smuggle out of this country.
Well, what is the legal limit on that?
We only had one foreign kid.
The limit is zero, you hoser.
- Damn it.
- Hey, I'd keep a civil tongue in my head if I were you.
We could throw you in jail right now.
We're the Mounties; we answer to no one.
Look, Fez just lost his green card.
We just-We didn't want any trouble.
Lost green card?
Seems a little convenient, eh?
You got us.
We're here to take over your country.
Hyde, I know it seems funny when you say stuff like that but, um, don't.
No one leaves until we get answers, eh?
Eh?
Eh?
- What are you doin' in Canada?
- What are you doin' in Canada?
We're part of an elite, high school terrorist team Strike Force Wisconsin.
Uh, we just came here to get the beer, and I love Rush.
"Fly by night"!
Ow!
Well, if ham's Canadian bacon, then what the hell do you call bacon?
Me no "speakaz" English.
What's your business in Canada?
What's your business in Canada?
What?
Getting beer.
Every once in a while, do you ever get an American nickel in your change?
Me no "understando".
What's your reason for coming to Canada, eh?
- What's your reason- - Shut up!
Yeah.
I'm here to nail Margaret Trudeau.
Been there.
Done that.
Beer.
Beer.
Beer!
Are those snowshoes hard to walk in?
They're tennis rackets, aren't they?
Wee foobie deebie doobie.
Woobie deebie doobie?
Woobie deebie- Jackie, can't you see?
This woman is just tryin' to make money off you.
Donna, she deserves her cut.
She discovered a remarkable talent.
Donna, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.
Jackie, I pity you because you're dumb.
Administrative fees?
Publicity shots?
Beauty packages?
It's a scam.
This is the most important thing that's ever happened to me, and you're trying to ruin it.
- Look, Jackie, I'm sorry, but- - And to think I was gonna make you my assistant.
Our nail care package is optional, but if you're really serious- Oh- Oh, I am.
I am fully committed to both fame and fortune.
You are going places.
That'll be another $200 then.
Excellent.
Hi, I'm Michelle Ray.
- I know.
I was just here.
- Of course you were.
I told you to stay in the car, you dream killer.
Jackie, I'm here for you.
And, as a matter of fact I've decided to be a model too.
Oh, Donna, you're so funny!
Donna, you're gonna need $200 for publicity costs.
And then there's administrative fees.
- Wait, wait.
You didn't even ask her to shake her hair.
- Oh, yeah.
Shake your hair.
You are a remarkable talent.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
You think Donna here can be a model?
This is a scam.
How dare you soil the pure and noble art of modeling?
I like your passion.
Have you ever considered acting?
Oh, my God.
That's my dream.
-  We're going.
- Oh.
And time!
Let's watch Roots.
Oh, Red, I'm sleepy.
Can we watch it in the morning?
In the morning?
But I just taped it.
Well, I know, but I thought the whole point was we can watch it whenever we want.
- But I just taped it.
- Fine.
Let's watch it now.
Great.
Now, I just punch "play," and, voilà- Roots.
Where's Roots, Red?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to rewind the tape.
The tape.
This tape?
How do they get the movie onto the tape when it's way the heck over here, Red?
- It's complicated.
- Good night, Red.
Damn!
I should've got the microwave.
- Thanks for looking out for me.
- Sure.
And I've thought about it, and you could be a model.
Hmm.
Thanks, Jackie.
That's nice.
You guys are in real trouble if you did what we think you did.
- What do you think we did?
- What do you think we think you did?
What do you think we think you think we did?
Something involving a foreign kid in the back of a car.
- That much is for sure.
- And now we're gonna get some answers.
- What are you gonna do?
Torture us?
- Yeah.
You gonna make us listen to Anne Murray records?
Hey, she's a wonderful Performer, and you're not funny.
No.
I think what we're gonna do is call your parents.
Oh, Red is going to kill you.
I mean- obie deebie doobie.
No!
We had to smuggle Fez.
It was the only way for him to see this great country with its spacious skies and fruited waves of plain.
And- Oh, Canada Our home and native land - Nice try, kid.
- True patriot love In all thy sons' command - It's not gonna work.
- With glowing hearts We see thee rise the true north strong as- -  -  From far and wide Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee God keep our land Glorious and free Oh, Canada We stand on guard for thee Oh, Canada We stand on guard for thee - You sure are good kids.
- Thanks, man.
You know, there must be some way to put this all behind us.
Yeah, but there's not.
- We'll give you our beer.
-  Oh, God bless you, son.
My green card.
I hid it in my right shoe for safekeeping.
I even made up a rhyme so I would remember.
My green card in my right shoe Something, something right shoe So, see, it was just a big misunderstanding.
Thank God we got that cleared up.
We're just gonna grab our beer and head on out of here.
Yeah.
But you're not gettin' your beer back.
Now leave Canada, please.
- You leave Canada, please.
- Get- Filthy hippie.
Guys, I have to admit something.
I love Anne Murray.
She puts me in the mood.
So, guys, next time, instead of goin' to Canada let's just stay here and pretend we're in Canada.
So, how's it goin', eh?
Hey, you know, if Fonzie ever played a Mountie on HaPPy Days he could go, "Aay, eh"?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Okay, here comes Kelso.
Oh, this is going to be so good.
But plug your nose, because it's also going to be foul.
- All right, somebody put a stink bomb in my backpack!
- Oh!
And when I find out who, I'm gonna kick some ass!
Why must people be cruel?
Yeah, 'cause now I gotta go seeJackie smelling like a skunk.
And Jackie hates skunks, except for Pepé le Pew.
And, you gotta admit, for a skunk, he's pretty romantic.
Okay, guys, I've got five stink bombs left.
Let's go ruin someone else's day.
Sorry, guys.
I'm going to the movies with Donna.
It's like we hardly see each other, now that she got that job at the radio station.
Yeah, you're the wife of a famous radio personality.
Go bake me a pie, Martha.
Oh, my God.
Donna's on the radio.
She's doing the farm report right now.
And in pork belly news prices have risen to nearly Mmm-mmm, bacon!
Pork belly prices.
How cute is that?
And I'll be back at 3:00, 4:00 and 5:00 with more uPdates.
Until then, keep on farmin'.
Is that okay?
I just added that.
I did hit the button.
- Oh!
-  She's staying late again?
Oh, God.
How much fast-breaking pork belly news can there possibly be?
That's it.
I'm goin' down there.
- Well, that conversation's going to go badly.
- How do you know?
I put a stink bomb in his back pocket.
You're doin' the rest of the farm reports?
Come on.
I thought we were goin' to the movies.
Well, Janice called in sick, so- Why do you smell like butt?
That is none of your business, okay?
Okay, Donna, look.
I think we need to talk.
I think this job is really cutting into your Eric time.
My "Eric time"?
And I'm very concerned about your diminishing Eric time because it directly affects me, you know.
I'm Eric.
Hey, thanks for staying late again, Donna.
You know, you might just turn this into a full-time gig.
Hey, I'm her full-time gig.
No offense.
You stink, dude.
Here's those tickets.
Enjoy the show.
- Tickets?
- I know I've been working a lot lately.
I wanted to make it up to you, so I got Max to hook us up with Ted Nugent tickets for everybody!
The Motor City Madman?
No way!
Oh, my disappointment is melting into a mixture of excitement and guilt.
- Great.
That's what I was going for.
- Oh!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
As soon as I saw that skunk, I knew that I had to caPture it and return it to the zoo where it could maybe, just maybe fall in love like you and I. - Oh!
Michael, that is so sweet.
- Yeah.
That's me- sweet.
So, here we are.
What to do.
What to do.
Oh, I know what we can do.
It.
No, Michael, I'm not doing "it" in a car.
Now that we're back together, I want it to be special.
I want our second first time to be magical.
I can do magic.
Check it out.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Michael, I'm serious.
Jackie, I just removed a finger!
All right, how about this?
We'll have a special day just dedicated to all the romantic magic you want.
That's a great idea.
But you know what would be even better?
If we did it right now?
No!
That instead of one day we have a whole week of romantic magic.
Well, that would be seven times longer.
And seven times better.
And seven times longer.
Yea.
You know, our anniversary's comin' up.
Eighteen years.
I can still remember the first time I saw Midgie.
She was the tallest girl in chemistry class.
And Bob was the shortest boy.
But what he lacked in height, he made up for in shortness.
Red, um, remember when we first met?
Like it was yesterday.
It was 1952 at a U.S.O. Dance.
Me and my buddies were blowin'off steam.
And, suddenly, I saw her.
She was the most beautiful girl in thejoint.
Hiya, dame.
Wanna shake a leg?
No, thanks.
- It wasn't a question.
- I think it was, mister.
Mind if I cut in?
It's none of your business, bell-bottom.
I think you could use a little punch, leatherneck.
Oh, you're in big trouble, Red Forman.
Huh?
I said, you're in big trouble, Red Forman.
You're thinking of some other girl.
That's not how we met at all.
Oh.
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Fez, what's in the box?
Counterfeit concert T-shirts.
Me and Hyde are going to sell them after the show.
Oh, how entrepreneurial of you.
You see, I figure with the original concert T's going for $15 we sell ours for 10, I turn a $50 investment into 250 bucks.
Where'd you get 50 bucks?
I thought you were broke.
I sneaked it from your Candy Land stash.
So if you think about it, it's all profit.
Okay, fine.
Can I borrow $50?
Hey, you wanna see what Fez!
It's "Ted" Nugent!
Uh-huh.
Tad Nugent.
No, man.
I'm saying "Ted".
I'm saying Tad too.
- No, you're not.
It says "Tad".
- I know it says "Tad".
I'm the one who put it on there.
I don't know why we're fighting.
What's the problem here?
Because the shirt says "Tad".
Exactly.
- But the "A" should be an "E".
- That's not how you spell "Tad".
No.
That's how you spell "Ted".
Oh.
These shirts are useless.
Now Forman's out 50 bucks.
You know, it's hard enough trying to remember this without you two staring at me.
Hey, I could hypnotize you.
I know!
You could retrace your steps.
What did you have for breakfast?
Oh, hi, Kitty.
Uh, you know I was just thinking about how much I love you.
- So, you remember yet?
- Yes!
No.
It was November 17, 1953 at a U.S.O. Dance.
I remember because it was the most important moment of my life!
Really, Kitty?
Because in November 1953 I was in Korea.
So I'm pretty sure that you were talking to someone else.
Are you sure?
Maybe-Maybe you came home for the weekend.
Not from Korea.
Oh, great.
Now, neither one of us knows how we met.
Well, you better get your thinking cap on, mister.
Thank you, Wisconsin.
!
Good night.
!
- That was the coolest, most bitchin' concert!
- That was so cool!
- Totally!
- That was cool.
All right, let's go try and sell these stupid T-shirts.
God, Michael, this was the most magical night.
You know, during the concert, I rewrote some ofTed Nugent's songs with your name in it.
Okay, which one do you like better "Cat Scratch Jackie" or "Jackie Scratch Fever"?
I love them both!
- What do you wanna do now?
- Uh- Ooh!
We can go around back and watch the tour buses from behind the chain-link fence.
- Great idea!
- Hiya, kids.
Enjoy the show?
Are you kidding?
I'm deaf!
You can say that again, Max.
Well, you know, I'm startin' to come down.
I mean, I'm getting tired.
Uh, why don't you take this?
Oh, my God.
A backstage pass.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, too bad there's only one, huh?
I'll be back in five minutes, I swear.
- You're going?
- Well, don't you want me to?
Of course I do.
That's why I said, "Oh, you're going!
Yea"!
You're the best!
Yeah, that's-Yeah, that's good.
That's nice for her.
You'll never see her again.
That's how I lost my first wife.
Damn you, Donny Osmond!
T-shirts!
Get your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!
Can't enjoy the after-party without your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!
I rue the day I took you under my wing, my foreign friend.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Hyde but I think that the time we spended together has taught us each a little bit about tolerance humanity, friendship.
Whatever.
Ew!
Michael, someone blew chunks.
May I escort you across the vomit, my lady?
Why, thank you, good sir.
I hate them.
You just bought yourself a barfy Todd Nugent T-shirt, mister!
Fez.
It's Ted!
Hey, who ordered the redhead?
Oh, my God.
You're looking at me.
Ted Nugent is looking at me.
Oh, my God.
!
StoPlooking at me.
!
I'm Donna.
I am, like, your biggest fan.
Hi, Donna.
Meet the other groupies.
This is Blonde Girl, the Other Blonde Girl Tall Girl, and the Tall Blonde Girl.
Well, actually, I'm not a groupie.
I mean, I love you, but I work at a rock radio station.
WFPP, "The Sound".
I do the farm report.
It's, like, a huge day for pork bellies.
You don't care.
Sorry.
You work for a radio station?
You wanna do an interview or somethin'?
Oh, my God.
An interview would be amazing.
Do you have, um, a piece of paper, one of those, uh- Pens.
Pens.
Exactly.
You are the best.
Okay, first question.
Um- Uh- Oh, my God.
Why are you so great?
Hey, guys, have you seen Donna?
Look, Forman, no offense.
We got more important things to worry about here.
Right.
Good luck in jail, guys.
You know, I had a dream like this once.
Only I was handcuffed to Cheryl Tiegs and you weren't wearing your sunglasses.
It's not just tonight, you know.
Yeah, she's been blowing me off more and more.
And she thinks I'll take it, but I won't.
Uh-uh.
Can you lift your feet, please?
Sorry.
And I'm not listenin' to your little story so you really need to stop talkin' to yourself.
What is wrong with you people?
Come on!
That was great!
What, are you on dope?
Oh.
Well, uh, I better go.
My boyfriend's waiting.
Thank you so much for the interview, Ted.
You're very welcome.
You wanna stick around?
I'll let you touch the guitar.
Really?
All right!
Wait, you mean your guitar guitar, right?
Yeah.
All right!
Ooh!
Michael, I have to say, this has really been a magically romantic day.
Actually, it's after midnight.
So it is now officially day two of magical romance week.
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Michael!
And I've got some great stuff planned for the rest of the week.
We're gonna have a picnic, and I'm gonna cook for you.
Oh, and we're gonna go for a ride on a rickshaw.
You know what?
You are the most romantic man in Point Place.
Yep.
You know, at first, I thought this was gonna suck.
But now I've really gotten into it and I'm glad that we're waiting seven days to do it.
God, Michael, you really have changed.
You're so different.
And we're different.
Okay, let's do it.
Now!
Whoa.
L-I thought you didn't wanna do it in a car.
No, Michael, you're so irresistible, I can't wait.
What about the rest of the week?
I mean, I rented a tux and patent leather shoes!
Okay, you guys, come on.
Open up.
I've had a really bad night.
We need the car, Eric.
We're gonna do it, and it's gonna be magical.
Oh, Red, it's killing me that I can't remember.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.
But I'll tell you one thing I remember.
I remember that you loved Manhattans.
Oh, that's right.
That's what I used to drink.
Oh, I haven't had a Manhattan in 20 years.
Oh, boy, that takes me back.
Oh!
Oh!
Keep 'em coming.
Oh, my.
I'm as loose as a goose.
Okay, let's do it.
Upsy-daisy.
I need to use the ladies'-  - You all right?
- I bumped into your butt and fell down!
Sorry.
My pants were, uh-  Hi.
I'm Red Forman.
How do you do, Red Forman?
I'm Kitty Sigurdson.
You bumped into my butt and fell down?
And that's how we met?
I'm afraid so.
Well, what do you say if Eric ever asks we go with the "I punched out a marine" story?
And I wasn't drinking.
I was reading to the blind.
Sounds good.
Oh, my God, Eric.
I have so much to tell you.
I actually met Ted Nugent, and I got an interview.
And I know I said I'd be right back, but- It was so exciting!
Oh.
Yeah, my night too.
I met the janitor.
And then, I got to see Kelso take his pants off.
Rock and roll!
Eric, you're mad at me for going backstage to meet Ted Nugent?
No, no.
I'm mad at you because you ditched me.
I didn't ditch you.
This was Ted Nugent.
This was a huge opportunity for me.
So, come Monday, I don't have to just talk about the farm report.
I can talk about the interview, like an interviewer.
Well, you know what, Donna?
All I can say is that my mom never would have bailed on my dad like that.
Yeah, I know.
But they're married.
Okay.
Okay, forget it.
Let's just forget it.
You're sorry.
Everything's fine.
I never said I was sorry.
But you are, right?
I shouldn't have to be.
We are free!
At last, we are free!
Yeah.
They tried to charge us with selling counterfeit merchandise.
But since Ted Nugent was misspelled, it wasn't really counterfeit.
It was just stupid.
My ignorance of American youth culture finally paid off.
Hey, Donna, did you get to meet the Nuge?
Yeah, it was awesome.
I was right there with Ted Nugent.
The Nuge!
So, can we go now?
Excuse me!
You're ruining the magic!
You going to a clown funeral?
Shut up!
I'm romantic.
- Nice rental, Kelso.
- Joke's on you.
I bought it.
Yeah, that's right.
It's mine.
Well, I think you look handsome, Michael.
Thank you, Jackie.
Hey, Fez, you ever pull a rickshaw?
What's a rickshaw?
Come on.
It's fun.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Just countin' my secret stash.
- I'm gettin' something special for Donna.
- Something special, huh?
Oh, is it firecrackers?
No.
No, no, 'cause if it's somethin' that blows up, I'll go halfsies.
It's a promise ring.
'Cause, you know, Donna and I have been fighting a lot lately.
Forman, you get mushy with Donna she's gonna see the secret girl inside the man.
Now, trust me, you don't want to let Erica out.
Erica.
That's a good burn.
You can't do that with Michael.
I'm lucky.
Oh, really, Michelle?
Oh, I forgot about Michelle.
Look, Hyde obviously doesn't understand mature relationships but I do.
And a promise ring is not only a gift from the heart but it also means more sex and less mouthing off.
I'm gettin' one for Jackie too!
Great.
Let's go.
All right.
See you later, Hyde-a alicia.
What's a good girlie name for Hyde?
Uh, Hyde drangea?
It's Heidi, you morons!
Heidi!
Okay, is it me, or is this not a ring store?
Will you trust me?
I know a guy who knows a guy.
He'll be here any minute.
Hey, dudes.
Leo's the guy?
Kelso, I thought you knew a guy who knew a guy.
Yeah, I do.
But I know Leo.
Fine, so you're the guy!
So, Leo, you sell promise rings?
Promise rings, concert T's other stuff.
- Really?
- That's nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we'll take two rings and a misdemeanor's worth of the other stuff.
Ah, the ring of love.
Just holding it makes me feel mellow and content.
Actually, that might not be the ring.
Why is everybody but Fez in love?
If I don't get some romance soon, I'm going to give myself a blister.
Well, another blister.
Tell you what, Fez.
I'm going to take you cruising for chicks in the El Camino.
And I'm gonna let you buy the gas and buy my dinner.
And if we meet a chick I'm gonna let you walk home.
Guys, what if Jackie doesn't want a ring from a guy like me?
I mean, sure, I'm good lookin', but I can't be trusted.
No, you guys are the perfect couple.
You do the bad stuff, and she tries to catch you.
She's Smokey to your Bandit.
God, it's like that movie applies to everything!
I just I wish there was a way I could give Jackie a thing that wasn't actually the ring.
You know, like a a test gift just to see what she would say.
And then if it went bad, I could just walk away.
Hey, am I talking in rhyme?
I wish I could do that all the time.
Oh!
Oh, man!
That was fun, huh?
It was a good movie.
It was one of those love movies like you like, huh?
And who took ya?
This guy.
- Yeah, it was great.
- You know what else this guy did for ya?
Got you a present.
"To Donna.
Love, This Guy".
Yeah.
That's me.
Oh, my God!
It's a promise ring.
Eric, it's it's beautiful.
I'm so glad you like it.
'Cause look - even though things have been a little weird lately - Oh!
Look how cute on the car!
Here, look what Eric got me!
Oh, my!
Red, go get the camera.
- Kitty - Mom, I Go!
It's in the drawer near the cheese grater.
Mom No.
Hush.
Donna, now make the face you made when Eric gave you the ring.
Oh, now, see, I don't think you rolled your eyes!
Kitty I cut myself on the cheese grater.
Oh, now you get back here and smile, damn it!
Can you believe it?
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.
I really need to introduce you to my good friend nail polish.
And a promise ring is sacred, Donna.
- Why aren't you wearing it on your left ring finger?
- I don't know.
'Cause I like it on this finger.
What's the difference?
Donna, if you don't wear your promise ring on your left ring finger it totally cancels out the promise that you will be together forever.
Wait.
That's what I promised?
Hey, ladies.
Oh, nice ring, Donna.
Jackie, let me see yours.
- I don't have one.
- Oh, no, of course not.
Because Kelso has not given you one yet.
I mean, ever.
I mean Look away.
Donna, did you hear that?
Michael's giving me a promise ring.
- Yeah, that's great.
- I wonder how he's gonna give it to me.
I hope he hides it in food.
I told him if he ever gives me something nice he should put it in food.
It's classy.
All right, man, be cool.
These chicks are checking us out.
Cool, gotcha.
Hello, ladies!
No, man, that's not how you do it.
You gotta be aloof.
Did you just call me a "loof"?
Because if so, I'll have to kick you in your 'nads.
No, man.
Aloof.
Distant.
Zen.
Well, that's not what loof means in my language.
Look, I don't care what you think it means, that's what it means here.
You're the loof.
- Fez, it's not - I said loof!
Hey, sweetie.
I got you something.
It's a gift.
A token of my love.
- Do you accept it?
- A sundae?
Oh.
Yeah.
Mmm!
Michael, this is good.
Uh You could, uh Uh, y-you could close your mouth if you if you wanted.
What the hell, Michael?
This is ice cream.
Stupid ice cream?
No, it's stupid ice cream of love.
Oh, there you are.
The movie's about to start.
Come on.
We're - Where's your ring?
- Oh, I put it on a chain so I could wear it around my neck.
Burn!
Oh, super burn.
The wedding's off!
Kelso, shut up!
Yeah, Michael, you don't know anything about anything.
I do too!
Now I don't know which fight's the funniest.
Wait, fight?
We're Okay, I'll be right back.
Donna, why aren't you wearing the ring on your hand?
I don't know.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
That is not true!
I told you.
I told her it was a big deal.
Look, Eric, why don't we talk about this later?
Well, I You know, there's not really anything to talk about.
Unless you don't wanna wear the ring.
Ouch!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's great.
The ring is great.
See?
- It's great.
- So we're good?
Yeah, fine.
Okay, good.
It's my God-given right as a mother!
Oh, Mrs. Forman, that is a wonderful picture.
You can really see how unhappy Donna is.
Okay, all I know is when Donna said she was fine, she didn't seem that fine.
Eric has never been good at knowing when fine isn't fine.
It runs in the family.
Oh, it does not.
- Fine.
- Okay, good.
I don't know.
She doesn't look that unhappy.
She kinda looks like you.
I'm unhappy, Bob.
I'm just so worried about Eric and Donna.
Ah, fine.
Welcome to Let's Make A Deal!
All right, Donna, which is it going to be your future behind door number one, door number two or door number three?
Oh, my God!
I don't know!
Um - Okay.
- Yeah?
- Door number three.
- Door number three.
All right, let's take a look at what you didn't choose behind door number one!
It's a leather jacket and a typewriter which you could have used when you became a globe-trotting rock-and-roll journalist.
Wow, that would've been nice.
Yeah, too bad.
All right, let's take a look at what was behind door number two.
The U.S. Constitution, which would come in handy when you became the first woman president!
Oh, Monty, these prizes are bitchin'!
Yeah, truly bitchin'.
Now let's take a look at what you did choose behind door number three.
It's your boyfriend and a promise ring!
I love you!
Hyde, when I cruise a girl how long do I have to talk to her before she will French me?
That depends on what kind of girl you're cruising for.
Which is why I'm gonna aim low.
Real low.
Just this side of gross.
Where is Michael Kelso?
I want my ring!
He's in the toilet.
Jackie, wait, wait.
Kelso wants to give you the ring - but he's scared.
- Why is he scared?
Because you're scary.
No, because Kelso is delicate, sensitive.
Girlish even.
You cannot push him into this.
You gotta be gentle.
He'll do it when he's ready.
Where's my ring, you idiot?
Or yell at him.
It's more fun for us.
Look, you, I want my promise ring, and I want it now.
Give it.
Really?
Okay, just wait.
'Cause I I just I wanna do this right.
Jackie from the first minute that I saw you I knew that I wanted to fool around with you.
And then, after we did that and I still wanted to talk to you?
I knew that I never wanted to be without you.
So will you accept my ring?
Yeah.
Yeah, Michael, I will.
Oh, God.
I know.
Hey, what's up?
- So, how was cruising?
- Unsettling.
When a girl is in a car, you can only see her from the neck up.
Talk about the tip of the iceberg!
Oh.
- So where's Donna?
- Ah, she said she had to study.
Oh.
So everything's cool?
Okay Look I don't know what everyone thinks is going on but Donna and I are not only fine we're great.
Everything's finally settled, so we're happier than ever.
Well, one of you is.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Look, Forman I get what you're trying to do.
You know, you're trying to lock her up, seal the deal.
And all I'm saying is Maybe Donna's not that kind of girl.
Okay, you don't know as much as you think, Hyde.
So you need to just shut up.
Now, that man is a loof.
Hey!
What are you doing out here?
Um I wanted to talk to you.
Look, this is gonna be hard.
Um Eric, I love you.
A lot.
But I have to give you your ring back.
What?
Why?
Okay How do you see the next 20 years?
I don't know.
I guess I always figured we'd go to college together, then come home Yeah, but, Eric, you know that's not what I want.
I mean, I've told you that.
And who knows?
I might want to go to school back East.
Or maybe in Paris.
Okay, well, you know what, Donna, whatever.
Okay?
The important thing is when you see yourself in Paris or wherever I'm there, right?
Right?
I don't know.
Not always.
I mean, it's not like there's anyone else but sometimes I'm by myself.
I mean All I mean is, I don't know.
Neither of us does.
And this ring is just a stupid high school promise.
If we're meant to be together, then we'll end up together.
No.
The way we end up together is by saying we'll be together and then, being together.
Eric, come on.
We're together now.
Isn't that enough?
No!
I mean I mean, damn, Donna.
If you can see a future for yourself without me and that doesn't, like, break your heart then we're not doing what I thought we were doing here.
And you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all!
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?
Well are you giving back that ring?
- Yes.
- Then Yes.
- Leo, I I need to return this.
- Hey, man I only said it was gold, not real gold.
No, it's Donna and I broke up.
What?
What happened to the love, man?
Well, I don't really feel like No!
If you kids can't make it, who can?
Tell me, who?
Why, God, why?
