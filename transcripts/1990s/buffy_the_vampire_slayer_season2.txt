{START OF EPISODE 1}
OK, um - It's your turn.
|- OK.
Uh "In the few hours that we had together,|we loved a lifetime's worth".
- Terminator,|- Good!
Right.
OK, I got one.
- "It's a madhouse!
A mad"|- Planet of the Apes, - Can I finish, please?
|- Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
..
house"!
.
Planet of the Apes, OK, good.
Me.
Uh Well?
I'm thinking.
"Use the Force, Luke".
Do I even have to dignify that with a guess?
I couldn't think of anything.
|It's a dumb game anyway.
What else d'you wanna do?
|We played rock, paper, scissors.
I got cramp.
Well, if you're always "scissors",|your tendons I just gotta say this has been|the most boring summer ever.
Yeah, but on the plus side,|no monsters or stuff.
I'm just so restless.
I'm actually|looking forward to school starting up again.
That would have nothing to do with a certain|girl we both know, who is a vampire slayer.
Please!
I'm so over her.
Did she mention when she might be|gettin' back?
About which I do not care.
I haven't heard from her.
I got two postcards|from her in LA, but they're like nothing.
She's probably with her dad|havin' a good time.
- And you don't care?
|- Well, OK.
There might be some interest.
I'm a man.
I have certain desires and needs.
I-I don't wanna know.
I got a movie for ya.
- Xander!
|- You're Amish.
You can't fight back cos you're Amish.
|I mock you with my ice cream, Amish guy.
Witness, - My nose is cold.
|- Let me get that for ya.
Xander!
I can't help myself.
Your nose looks so tasty.
Willow, go.
Hi, guys.
Miss me?
- Buffy!
|- Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Will.
Man, your timing really doesn't suck.
- When d'you get back?
|- Just now.
Dad drove me.
I figured you two losers|would be getting into trouble.
I think we had the upper hand|in a subtle way.
Does either of you have a cross?
Sloppy.
It's been a slow summer.
It's the first vampire|we've seen since you killed the Master.
It's like they knew I was coming back.
How was your summer?
Slay anything?
No.
Just hung out, partied some,|shopping was also a major theme.
- You haven't lost your touch.
That vampire|- I did kinda whale on him, didn't I?
I like your hair.
Did you have any fun without me?
- Yes.
|- No.
Our summer was yawn-worthy.
Our|biggest excitement was burying the Master.
That's right, you missed it.
Up by that tree.
Giles buried the bones, we poured|holy water and we got to wear robes.
Very intense.
You shoulda been.
Have you seen Giles?
Why would I do that?
I'll see him at school.
I'm really glad you're back.
Me too.
- OK, then.
This is the last of it.
|- More clothes?
- Oh, do shoes count as clothes?
|- How much shopping did you let her do?
I thought I was saving you from|the back-to-school clothing nightmare.
My nightmares with Buffy in school|have nothing to do with clothes.
Did she manage to stay out of trouble in LA?
She did, yeah.
She was you know great.
But?
She was just, I don't know, um ..
distant.
Not brooding or sulking, just|There was no connection.
The more time we spent together, the more|I felt like she was nowhere to be seen.
Hence the shoes?
I may have overcompensated a little bit.
It's so strange.
At least when she was|burning stuff down I knew what to say.
Welcome to my world.
I haven't been able to get through|to her for so long.
I'll just be happy if|she makes it through the school year.
It was a nightmare.
A total nightmare.
They promised me they'd take me to St Croix,|then they decide to go to Tuscany.
Art and buildings.
|I was totally beachless for a month and a half.
No one has suffered like I have suffered.
Of course, that kind of adversity|builds character.
But then I already have a lot of character.
Can you have too much character?
- The first day back.
It always gets me.
|- Yes.
I mean, it's incredible.
One day|the campus is completely bare, empty.
The next, there are children everywhere.
Like locusts, crawling around,|mindlessly bent on feeding and mating, ..
destroying everything in sight|in their relentless, pointless desire to exist.
I do enjoy these pep talks.
Have you ever considered,|given your abhorrence of children, ..
school principal was not|perhaps your true vocation.
Somebody's gotta keep an eye on them.
|They're a bunch of hormonal time bombs.
Every time a pretty girl walks by,|every boy turns into a gibbering fool.
- Ms Calendar.
|- Mr Giles.
Well, I um Hello.
You see the way these kids|9aze at each other all moony?
- It's good to see you.
|- Yes.
Think they're thinking about learning?
!
Were you headed to the faculty room?
Sounds like fun.
I try and tell them about|the important things in life.
Discipline, responsibility, punctuality.
I might as well be talkin' to myself.
- How was your summer?
|- Extreme.
I did "Burning Man" in Black Rock.
|A great festival.
You should've been there.
They had drum rituals, mobile sculptures,|raves, naked mud dances.
You would have just|hated it with a fiery passion.
I can't imagine finding any redeeming Naked?
You probably spent summer|with your nose in a book.
- I suppose you'd consider that dull.
|- Depends on the book.
- Giles!
|- Yo, G-Man!
What's up?
- Nice to see you.
Don't ever call me that.
|- Hi, kids.
- Hey.
|- Hi.
- How are you?
|- Alive and kicking.
Buffy killed a vampire last night.
You can get more volume|if you speak from the diaphragm.
- Sorry.
|- I thought the Hellmouth was closed.
It's closed, but not gone.
The mystical energy|it emits is still concentrated in this area.
So we're still the undead's|favourite party town.
- I wonder if they're here for a purpose.
|- You're the Watcher.
I just work here.
Yes, I must consult my books.
Oh, eight minutes and 33 seconds.
Pay up.
I called ten minutes before|you'd consult your books.
Thank you.
We'd better get to class.
Oh, Buffy.
I realise you've just returned, but when you're|ready we should start your training again.
I'm ready.
I'll see you after school.
I understand if you want a few days to I'm ready.
Buffy, that's enough.
Buffy!
- Safe to say you've stayed in shape.
|- I'm ready.
Whatever they got comin' next, I'm ready.
Yeah.
We have been put down, kinsmen.
We have lost our way.
We have lost the night.
But despair is for the living.
Where they are weak, we will be strong.
Where they weep, we rejoice.
Where they bleed ..
we drink!
Within three days a new hope will arise.
We will put our faith in him.
He will show us the way.
Buffy!
- Buffy?
|- Fine.
I'm fine.
Good.
It's good that you're fine.
- What were you thinking about?
|- Nothing.
Come on, you can tell us.
We're your|bosom friends.
The friends of your bosom.
Xander.
I wasn't thinking anything.
Really.
- What did you do last night?
|- Slept.
I had weird dreams.
- Dreams are meaningful.
|- Tell me about it!
I dreamt that Xander Uh, it wasn't Xander.
In fact, it wasn't me.
It was a friend's dream.
- She doesn't remember it.
|- I bet she doesn't.
Buffy!
Giles.
What is it?
You look worried.
This vampire activity.
|I know what they're up to.
- We'll deal with it.
|- I hope it's that simple.
It is not to worry.
Trust me.
I don't know.
I've killed you once.
|It shouldn't be too difficult to do it again.
What?
Hello.
Mind if I come in?
Be my guest.
How are you?
Peachy.
So, is this a social call?
|It is kinda late Or, well, it is for me.
What is it for you, lunch hour?
It's not a social call.
Ah, so let me guess.
|That means grave danger.
Gosh, it's good to be home.
I'm sorry.
I wish I had better news.
So, some of your cousins are in town for a|family barbecue, and we're all on the menu.
The Anointed One.
He's been gathering|forces somewhere in town.
I'm not sure why.
Guess I'll find out soon enough, huh?
- You don't sound too concerned.
|- I can handle myself.
Besides, I could use a little action anyway.
Don't underestimate the Anointed One|just because he looks like a child.
He has power over the rest of them.
They'll do anything for him.
Is that it?
Is that everything?
Cos you woke me up|from a really good dream.
Sorry.
I'll go.
I missed you.
I missed you # It doesn't matter what I want # It doesn't matter what I need # It doesn't matter How are your new classes?
Good.
Good.
Is there the slightest chance that if I asked|you what was wrong you would tell me?
Course not.
|It would take the fun out of guessing.
# ..
or where it leads Angel stopped by?
Wow!
Was there I mean,|was it having to do with kissing?
Willow, grow up.
|Not everything is about kissing.
Yeah, some stuff's about groping.
- It wasn't about groping?
|- OK, hormones on parade here?
It was pure shoptalk.
Remember vampires,|they walk by night?
Am I ringin' a bell?
What did he say?
Something's up.
Nothing I can't handle.
D'you guys hear Cibo Matto|are at the Bronze tonight?
- Cibo Matto!
They're playing?
|- No, they'll be clog-dancing.
Cibo Matto can clog-dance?
- Oh, sarcasm.
Right.
|- We should attend, no?
Oh, look.
It's the Three Musketeers.
- Was that an insult?
|- Kinda lacked punch.
- The Three Musketeers were cool.
|- I see your point.
- I'd have gone with "Stooges".
|- I just meant you're always together.
- So, you fight any demons this summer?
|- Yes, our own personal demons.
- Such as lust and thrift.
|- I would have to go with "Stooges" also.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about|big demons that came from the ground.
Remember?
Prom night?
|With all the vampires.
Cordelia, your mouth is open.
|Sound is coming from it.
This is never good.
No.
See, we can't mention that stuff here,|Buffy being the Slayer an' all.
You haven't been talking about|our adventure, have you?
Are you nuts?
You think I would tell people|that I spent the whole evening with you?
Besides, it was so creepy.
That Master guy,|all the screaming.
I don't like to think about it.
So, your secret's safe with me.
That works out great.
You won't tell anyone I'm the Slayer,|and I won't tell anyone you're a moron.
- Now, that was a good insult.
|- A little too good.
What's up with her?
# Oooh!
# Don't want the boys I just think something's up.
Willow, you're paranoid.
Buffy's never acted like this before.
- Ever since she got back, she's different.
|- Buffy's always been different.
She's never been mean.
Any sign of her?
She said she was coming.
- No.
The band's cool though.
|- Yeah, cool.
# We belong, yes, to-to-together # We belong, yes, to-to-together You got something on your nose.
Don't just stand there.
Dig!
We have to hurry.
The ground is consecrated.
It burns.
Dig.
# The velocity of time # Turns her voice into # Sugar water - Hi.
|- Hi.
So, is there danger at the Bronze?
|Should I beware?
I can't help thinkin' I've done|somethin' to make you angry.
And that bothers me more than I'd like.
I'm not angry.
|I don't know where that comes from.
What are you afraid of?
Me?
Us?
Could you contemplate|getting over yourself for a second?
There's no "us".
Angel, I'm sorry if I was supposed to spend|the summer mooning over you, but I didn't.
I moved on.
To the living.
Hey.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
What's wrong with Angel?
Beats me.
Let's dance.
OK.
# When a black cat # Crosses my path # A woman in the moon # Is singing to the earth # A woman in the moon # Is singing to the earth # I'm riding on a camel # That has big eyes # The buildings are changing|into coconut trees # Little by little Xander?
Did I ever thank you for saving my life?
No.
# ..
crosses my path # A woman in the moon Don't you wish I would?
# A woman in the moon # Is singing to the earth Buffy.
You're really campaigning for|Bitch of the Year, aren't you?
As defending champion, you nervous?
I can hold my own.
You know, we've never been close, which|is nice cos I don't like you that much, but ..
you have, on occasion, saved the world,|so I'm gonna do you a favour.
- And this great favour is?
|- I'm gonna give you some advice.
- Get over it.
|- Excuse me?
Whatever's causing|the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it.
Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet,|whatever, but get over it.
Cos soon you won't even have|the loser friends you've got now.
I think it's time you start|minding your own business.
It's long past.
Nighty-night.
I'll just see if Angel feels like dancing.
Ms Ms Calendar?
Oh, God!
Ms Calendar!
- She's possessed.
|- Possessed?
That's the only explanation|that makes any sense.
You should have seen her last night.
|That wasn't Buffy.
Are we overlooking the idea|that she may be attracted to me?
She's possessed.
- Possessed by what?
|- A possessing thing.
- That narrows it down.
|- You're the expert.
Maybe when the Master killed her,|a bad-guy transference thing happened.
That's what it was!
I mean, why else|would she be acting as such a B-I-T-C-H?
Willow, we're all a little too old|to be spelling things out.
A bitca?
Yes I suggest that the explanation for her|behaviour may be something more mundane.
She may simply have what|you Americans call "issues".
Her experience with the Master|must have been traumatic.
She was, for a few minutes, technically dead.
|She hasn't dealt with it on a conscious level.
She's convinced herself|that she's invulnerable - Interesting point on trout you brought up.
|- Trout?
Trout!
Yes, trout is a fish.
- Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
|- Like a rock.
Master's gone.
- I'm sorry?
|- The Master.
I went by his grave last night|and they have a vacancy.
- Good God.
|- Why would somebody want Master bones?
A trophy?
A horrible conversation piece?
They're gonna bring him back.
They're gonna bring the Master back to life|and you told me he was history.
Buffy, I-I've never heard of|a revivification ritual being successful.
But you've heard of them?
!
|Thanks for the warning.
Buffy, Giles did buy - This is Slayer stuff.
Less from the civilians!
|- That's enough!
I believe some of us have class.
|And some of us have jobs.
Y-yes, well, I'll see you all in the library|later.
We'll continue this discussion.
About trout.
There are some things I can just smell.
|It's like a sixth sense.
No, actually, that would be one of the five.
That Summers girl.
|I smell trouble, I smell expulsion, ..
and just the faintest aroma of jail.
Before you throw away the key,|give her the benefit of the doubt.
She may surprise you.
You really have faith in those kids, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Weird.
All right, I've got something.
|It's Latin, so bear with me.
To revive the vampire,|they need his bones - which they have - ..
and the blood - this is very unclear -|of the closest person - Someone connected to the vampire.
|- That'd be me.
- Perhaps.
|- We were close.
We killed each other.
|It really promotes togetherness.
Is there anything on|when the ceremony Whoa!
This is Cordelia's.
"Come to the Bronze before it opens,|or we make her a meal".
They're gonna cook her dinner?
- I'll pretend I didn't say that.
|- What do we do?
- I go to the Bronze and save the day.
|- I don't like this.
- Well, you aren't going.
|- What do you mean?
I can't do it any more.
I can't look after|the three of you while I'm fighting.
- What about the rest of the note?
|- What rest of the note?
- The part that says "PS, this is a trap"?
|- You'll be playing straight into their hands.
- I can handle this.
|- Stop saying that!
What's wrong with you?
Cordelia may be dead.
This is my fight.
You know, being stalked|isn't really a big turn-on for girls.
- You need someone to watch your back.
|- Sure you don't mean my neck?
Why are you ridin' me?
Because I don't trust you.
You're a vampire.
Oh, I'm sorry, was that an offensive term?
|Should I say "undead American"?
You have to trust someone.
|You can't do this alone.
- I trust me.
|- You're not as strong as you think.
Think you can take me?
What?
Oh, come on.
I mean,|you must have thought about it.
What would happen if it came to a fight?
|You vampire, me the Slayer.
You must have wondered.
Well, why don't we find out?
- I'm not gonna fight you.
|- Come on.
Kick my ass.
Don't you have somewhere to be?
- I do.
|- Well, you're wastin' time.
Just stay out of my way.
Happy to oblige.
That's not Cordelia.
Cordelia couldn't make it.
- Where is she?
|- I'm not supposed to tell.
I don't like this.
- Don't like what?
|- There's the bait.
Where's the hook?
You're right.
Why would they send just one?
We should have gone with her.
Buffy's about to lose it.
We should|try to reach minimum safe distance.
You know it's a trap.
The Latin is translated from|the Sumerian, and rather badly.
"Closest" to the Master,|actually translates as "nearest", physically.
The person or persons who were with him ..
when he It is a trap.
It just isn't for her.
Watch her.
Don't kill her unless you have to.
Buffy, what's going on?
I'll be back.
Xander!
What happened?
Vampires.
The ones you could|handle yourself.
- Where are the others?
|- I don't know.
I don't know what your problem is,|what your issues are, ..
but as of now I officially don't care.
If you'd worked with us for five seconds,|you coulda stopped this.
W-we just have to think.
|Where would they have taken them?
If they hurt Willow, I'll kill you.
Why did they take them and not you?
Giles said the ritual was, um They needed people who were close to|the Master, physically close when he The ones who were|with the Master when he died.
Giles, Willow, Cordelia.
Ms Calendar.
Odds are they've got a complete set by now.
We need to find out where.
How?
One more time: where are they?
You're too late.
Your friends are dead.
Tell me where they are!
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
As a matter of fact, ..
yes.
But, since I won't kill you any time soon, ..
the question becomes|how are we gonna pass the time till then?
So, one more time.
Begin.
Behold, these poor mortals.
Witnesses to our master's wretched demise.
They will breathe their last this night.
The blood that pours from their throats|will bring new life to the Old One.
We gather for his resurrection, ..
for the dawn of this new hell.
Buffy!
Buffy, we gotta do something now, - You two get the others out.
|- We need you to distract the vampires.
- Right.
|- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill them all.
That oughta distract 'em.
For the Old One.
For his pain.
- For the dark.
|- For the dark.
For the Argh!
The sacrifices!
Stop them!
- Are you all right?
|- Yeah, I'm OK.
- Where's Buffy?
|- She's workin' out her issues.
Enough!
Your day is done, girl.
I'll grind you into a sticky paste!
And hear you beg|before I smash in your face.
So, are you gonna kill me,|or are we just making small talk?
- It's over.
|- No, it's not.
It's OK.
It's OK.
What an ordeal.
|And you know what the worst part is?
- What?
|- It stays with you forever.
No matter what they tell you, none of that|rust and blood and grime comes out.
I mean, you can dry-clean till Judgement|Day, you are living with those stains.
That's the worst part of being hung upside|down by a vampire who wants to kill you.
- The stains.
|- I hear ya.
- I don't think I can face them.
|- Hm?
Oh, of course you can.
I can't!
What should I say?
"Sorry I almost|got your throat slit.
What's the homework"?
- Punishing yourself like this is pointless.
|- It's entirely pointy.
I was a moron.
I put my best friends in danger|on the second day of school.
- So are you going to go and live in a cave?
|- Would it have cable?
Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit that.
But|it's hardly the worst mistake you'll ever make.
That wasn't as comforting|as it was meant to be.
Well, points for effort.
I'll see ya.
Hey, Buffy.
Hey.
We saved you a seat.
There's a rumour going around that Mr Cox|is the most boring teacher in the world.
Like, I think he won a belt.
- Like, yes.
|- I hear he nods off a lot, so that's a plus.
- We Bronzin' it tonight?
|- Wednesday is kinda beat.
We could grind our enemies into powder with|a sledgehammer, but we did that last night.
How about miniature golf?
- There's no course here.
|- OK, uh miniature tennis?
I hate that girl.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, Come on, Stephan, rise and shine.
Some|of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
Hey.
- Is this a bad time?
|- Don't sneak up on people in a graveyard.
You make noise when you walk.
|You stomp or yodel.
- I heard you were on the hunt.
|- I'm supposed to be, but ..
lazybones doesn't wanna come out.
When you first wake up,|it's a little disorienting.
He'll show.
- It's weird to think of you going through that.
|- It's weird to go through.
So, uh, you're here alone?
- Yeah.
Why?
|- I thought you'd have somebody with you.
- Xander, or someone.
|- Xander?
- Or someone.
|- Nope.
Why?
Are you jealous?
- Of Xander?
Please!
He's just a kid.
|- Is it cos I danced with him?
"Danced with" is a loose term.
|"Mated with" might be closer.
Don't you think you're being a little unfair?
It was one dance, which I only did to make|you crazy, by the way.
Behold my success.
- I am not jealous!
|- What, vampires don't get jealous?
Whenever we fight,|you bring up the vampire thing.
I didn't come here to fight.
Oh, right, I did!
- Where's my stake?
I know I had a stake!
|- I didn't see a stake.
What d'you mean, he's just a kid?
|Does that mean I'm just a kid, too?
Look, obviously I made|a mistake coming here tonight.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't just turn|and walk away from me like that.
It takes more than that to get rid of me.
You OK?
I'm fine.
I wish people wouldn't leave|open graves laying around like this.
So another vampire has risen tonight.
I don't think so.
Look at those tracks.
Whoever was buried here|didn't rise from this grave.
She was dragged from it.
W-w-what I'm proposing is,|and I don't mean to appear indecorous, ..
is-is, um, a-a social engagement,|a-a date, if you're amenable.
You idiot!
Boy, I guess we never realised|how much you like that chair.
- I-I was just working on|- Your pickup lines?
Um in a manner of speaking, yes.
Then if you don't mind a little|Gene and Roger, leave off the "idiot" part.
Being called an idiot tends|to take people out of the dating mood.
It actually kinda turns me on.
I fear you.
You also might wanna avoid words|like "amenable" and "indecorous".
- Speak English, not whatever they speak in|- England?
Yeah.
You just say "I got a thing.
You maybe|have a thing.
Maybe we could have a thing".
- Thank you, Cyrano.
|- I'm not finished.
- Then say "How d'you feel about Mexican"?
|- About Mexicans?
Mexican.
Food.
- You take her for food, for which you pay.
|- Oh, right.
So this chair-woman?
|We are talking Ms Calendar, right?
- What makes you think that?
|- Simple deduction.
Ms Calendar is dollsome,|especially for someone in your age bracket.
She knows you're a librarian, so no need|to break that embarrassing news to her.
And she's the only woman we've seen|speak to you.
Add it up, it all spells "Duh".
Now, is it time to talk about the facts of life?
You know, this is none of your business.
Cos that whole stork thing is a smoke screen.
So, how did things go last night?
|Did Mr Korshak show up on schedule?
- More or less.
Angel and I took care of him.
|- Angel.
There's something else.
We found an empty grave.
- Another vampire?
|- No.
It was dug up and the body taken out.
Graverobbing?
That's new.
Interesting.
I know you meant to say|gross and disturbing.
Yes, yes, of course.
Terrible thing.
|Must put a stop to it.
Damn it.
So, why does someone|want to dig up graves?
I'll collate some theories.
It would help|if we knew who the body belonged to.
- Meredith Todd.
Ring a bell?
|- No.
- She died recently.
She was our age.
|- Drawin' a blank.
Why don't we ask Willow to fire|this "thing" up, and track Meredith down?
- Smile.
|- Hey!
- Oh, look at those legs.
|- No, thank you.
Eric, will you knock it off?
- Hey, Chris.
|- Hey.
Oh, I was just wondering|what you were gonna do this year.
- Why?
|- Cos every year you win and I play second, ..
so I just thought I'd see what I'm up against.
You know the key?
If Dr Clark|doesn't understand your experiment, ..
he gives you higher marks so it looks like|he understands your experiment.
"Effects of Subviolet Light|Spectrum Depravation ..
on the Development of Fruit Flies"?
|That should do the trick!
OK, I'm doing this under protest.
It is not fair they are making participation|in the science fair mandatory.
No one should have to do anything|educational in school, if they don't want to.
"The Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable"?
I wanted to do something|I could finish in a weekend.
- Stop it!
We are under fluorescent lights!
|- The camera loves you.
I didn't think yearbook nerds|came out of hibernation till spring.
- It's for my private collection.
|- Eric, will you quit it?
Coming through.
Sorry.
- Sorry to interrupt, but it's the Batsignal.
|- OK.
- See you later, Chris.
Thanks for the tip.
|- OK.
Cordelia's so fine.
|You know, she'd be just perfect for us.
Don't be an idiot.
She's alive.
Shouldn't take long.
|I'm the only girl in school ..
who has the coroner's office|bookmarked as a favourite place.
Sorry to interrupt your undead playgroup, but|I need Willow's help on my science project.
- It's a fruit.
|- I would've asked Chris to help me, ..
but then that would've brought back|too many memories of Daryl.
I found it!
Meredith Todd died|in a car accident last week.
Of course, I have learnt to deal with my pain.
- How was her neck?
|- Fine, except for being broken.
Hello!
Can we deal with my pain, please?
There, there.
It says that Meredith and two other girls|in the car were killed instantly.
They were all on the Fondren High|Pep Squad, on the way to a game.
You know what this means?
Fondren might beat Sunnydale|in the body-count competition?
It wasn't vampires.
|Somebody did dig up her corpse.
Eww!
Why is it that every conversation|you have has the word "corpse" in it?
We got a body snatcher.
|What does that mean?
Here's what I've found.
Demons who eat|the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls.
Or it could obviously be|a voodoo practitioner.
You mean, making a zombie?
Uh, zombies, For most traditional purposes,|a voodoo priest would require more than one.
We should see if the other girls|in the accident are AWOL, too.
We can figure out this creep|if we know if he deals in volume.
- So we dig up some graves tonight?
!
|- Oh, boy, a field trip!
You gonna call Angel?
- I don't think so.
|- Yeah, why bother him, huh?
Ange and I have been Never mind.
As far as he's concerned, I have the night off.
So we're set then.
|Say nine-ish?
BYO shovel.
And I'll pack some food.
|Who else likes powdered doughnuts?
- Hey!
|- Cordelia?
Darn, I have cheerleader practice tonight.
I wish I knew you'd be digging up|dead people sooner.
I'd have cancelled.
But if you come across the army of zombies,|can you page us before they eat your flesh?
- Xander?
|- Huh?
Zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
Yeah, I knew that.
|But did you see the look on her face?
I couldn't believe Angel.
He was acting|all jealous and he wouldn't even admit it.
- Jealous of what?
|- Of Xander.
Because you did that sexy dance with him?
- Am I ever gonna live that down?
|- Nope.
Anyway, he was being totally irrational.
- Love makes you do the wacky.
|- That's the truth.
This might go faster|if you fems picked up a shovel, too.
- Hear, hear!
|- Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned gal.
I was raised to believe that men dig up|the corpses and women have the babies.
Speaking of the wacky, what was Cordelia's|riff about painful memories?
Who's Daryl?
Daryl Epps.
Chris's older brother.
He was a big football star.
|All-state two years ago.
He was a running He was a running|Someone who runs and catches.
- Was he a studly?
|- Big time.
All the girls were crazy for him.
And he broke Cordy's heart?
|Thus possibly proving its existence.
He died.
Rock climbing,|or something.
He fell.
Man, that's lousy.
Poor Chris.
Ever since then, Chris has been real quiet,|kind of in his own world.
Their mother doesn't even|leave the house any more.
I think we're there.
By the way, are we hoping|to find a body, or no body?
Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping|to find a fortune in gold doubloons.
Um, body would mean flesh-eating demon.
No body would point towards the army|of zombies thing.
Take your pick.
Right then, go on.
- You're closer.
|- Pathetic much?
Move over.
Guys, if we don't get this down by tomorrow,|no one's gonna be led by our cheers.
- Practise.
|- OK.
See you later.
Hello?
Xander Harris, if this is some kind of joke Cordelia.
This is the last place|I expected you to hang out.
Oh, God.
- God, it's you.
Why were you following me?
|- I wasn't sure it was you at first.
- I'm looking for Buffy.
|- Buffy?
Well, she's, uh, big shock,|she's at the graveyard.
- She said she'd be home.
|- She lied.
Isn't she a rascal?
Well, you're in luck.
|It just so happens that my night is free.
Oh, hold on.
My skirt is caught.
There.
Both coffins empty makes three|girls signed up for the army of zombies.
- Is it an army if you just have three?
|- Zombie drill team then.
You're back.
- Angel.
|- Xander.
- Angel.
|- I thought you took the night off?
I did, but something came up.
- Cordelia told me the truth.
|- That's gotta be a first.
Um, as long as you're here,|perhaps you could be of some help.
Hm?
We were investigating.
Somebody's|been digging up the bodies of dead girls.
I know.
We found some of them.
- You mean, like, two of the three?
|- I mean, like, some of them.
Like parts.
It was horrible.
Angel saved me from an arm.
|God, there were so many parts everywhere.
Why are terrible things|always happening to me?
- Karma.
|- So much for our zombie theory.
- So much for all our theories.
|- I don't get it.
Why go to the trouble to dig up|three girls, only to throw them away?
It doesn't make sense, especially|from a time-management standpoint.
What I saw didn't add up to three whole girls.
- I think they kept some parts.
|- Could this get yuckier?
- They probably kept them to eat.
|- Question answered.
Why dispose of the remains five miles from|the cemetery, at a school, of all places?
Maybe because whoever did it had some|business in the neighbourhood, like classes.
This was no hatchet job.
Whoever made|those incisions knew what they were doin'.
Yes, really.
What student here|is that well-versed in physiology?
I can think of five or six guys|in the science club.
And me.
So, Will, come clean.
Promise to|never do it again, and we'll call it a night.
He joked!
Willow, get these guys' locker numbers.
No.
I have to go home now.
|I have to take a bath and burn my clothes.
You have to go?
|Ah, too bad.
Keep in touch.
Bye-bye.
I don't wanna go alone.
I'm still fragile.
Can you take me?
Great.
I'll drive.
How about that?
I always pegged him|as a one-woman vampire.
I'm going out, Mom.
I'll be back later, OK?
Mom?
Daryl!
Daryl!
Daryl!
In my capacity as school official, this search|is unauthorised.
I cannot condone it.
Fine, your butt's covered.
|Wanna grab a locker?
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
OK, Eric, let's see|what's on your annoying little mind.
Nothing in here but back issues|of Scientific American, Ooh, I haven't read this one.
Nothing remarkable here.
Guys.
Your friend Chris Epps' locker.
Grey's Anatomy, Mortician's Desk Reference,|Robicheaux's Guide to Muscles and Tendons, - I think it's fair to say Chris is involved.
|- He's into corpses, but we don't know why.
Yes, we do.
# I guess you say # What can make me feel this way?
# My girl # Talkin' 'bout my girl # My girl!
- How's my baby?
|- She's not your baby.
- She's nobody's baby if we don't finish soon.
|- I'm working on it!
So am I, friend.
So am I. - Any sign of our suspects?
|- Not yet.
I don't get it.
|Why would anybody wanna make a girl?
When there are so many|premade ones laying around - Things we do for love.
|- Love has nothing to do with it.
Maybe not, but people don't fall in love|with what's right in front of 'em.
People want the dream.
What they can't have.
|The more unattainable, the more attractive.
And for Eric, the unattainable|would include everyone that's alive.
Eric's sick enough to do something like this,|but Chris seems like a "human" person.
I don't know.
That thing|with his brother was really hard on him.
He talked about death a lot.
Maybe he just wanted to get one-up on it.
But it's not doable.
I mean, making someone from scraps,|actually making them live.
If it is, my science project's|definitely coming in second this year.
And speaking of love We were talking about|reanimation of dead tissue.
Do I deconstruct your segues?
Huh?
Hey.
Oh, yes.
Hello.
- Still no sign of our mad doctors?
|- What?
Oh, corpses.
Yes, evil.
Very good.
- Did you bring it?
Tomorrow|- Very good.
OK, Giles, just remember.
"I feel a thing.
|You feel a thing".
But personalise it.
- Personalise it?
|- She's a technopagan, right?
Ask her to bless your laptop.
- Have fun.
|- What?
Oh, don't - Best of luck.
|- ..
leave.
- Good morning, Rupert.
|- Ms Calendar?
Please, call me Jenny.
|"Ms Calendar" is my father.
Jenny, then.
You know, uh, Jenny,|um, would it appear indecorous No, not indecorous.
Uh Yeah?
Well Oh, dear.
I-I, um Rupert, I've got to get inside|and set up the lab.
What I'm proposing I gotta go!
Sorry.
Idiot!
Hey.
Listen, if it's important,|tell me at the game.
Game?
Oh, you're going|to the football game?
- Yeah.
You seem surprised.
|- No, no, uh I-I-I just assumed you spent your evenings|downloading incantations and casting bones.
On game night?
Are you nuts?
- You're going too, right?
|- Oh, of course.
- Always.
Always do.
|- So we should just go together.
I could pick you up after school.
|We'll grab a bite to eat, if you like.
How do you feel about Mexican?
Good.
Then whatever it is you want|to tell me, you can just tell me then.
OK?
OK.
Tonight, then.
That went well.
I think.
I still don't get how Chris could do it.
|Arresting cell deterioration is one thing, but "Hello.
I wanna get ahead, " Maybe an electrical current|combined with an adrenaline boost.
"For the love of God,|can somebody scratch my nose"?
- Chris and Eric didn't come to school today.
|- That's no coincidence.
- Maybe they finished their project.
|- God.
What if it worked?
- What if that poor girl is walking around?
|- Poor girls, technically.
- What could she be thinking?
|- What are they gonna do with her?
I don't think we have|to worry about that just yet.
I spoke to a press person this morning|about the remains.
The police have sorted through them,|and they found three heads in the Dumpster.
- They only had three girls.
|- Precisely.
So they don't have the whole, uh, package?
Heads must be no good.
|Huh.
I found 'em attractive enough.
- Obviously I'm not as sick as Chris and Eric.
|- Based on what the police put together, ..
I'd say they're one step short|of completing their masterpiece.
One step We're running out of time.
If we wait too long, the atrophy|in the limbs will be irreversible.
We can turn up the current.
|That'll buy us a day at least.
We will lose the body|if we don't attach a head soon!
- We have time.
|- We don't!
The crash with the girls was lucky.
We can't just keep waiting around for another|lucky accident to drop a head in our laps.
You know what we have to do.
- Hell, it's just one lousy girl.
|- I won't do it.
I I can't kill anyone.
Please understand.
I-I can't do that.
- Please don't make me.
|- But you gave me your word.
You promised me, little brother, ..
that I wouldn't be alone.
The body is perfect.
And if we harvest|a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise.
When you brought me back,|you promised you'd take care of me.
I need this, Chris.
I need someone.
Please don't ask me to do this.
|Don't ask me to take a life.
I tried to tell him.
If you take a life in order|to make a life, the whole thing is a wash.
- No harm, no foul.
|- Maybe you could you could go out.
- No!
|- Let people know.
They can't see me!
Chris, you've always been smarter than me.
You were always the brains.
You're the only one who can help me now.
Third and long, seconds to go, ..
where do you throw?
Where do you throw?
Number five.
Daryl's gonna drive.
Help me, brother.
Thank you.
Show me!
- This one!
|- Ha-ha.
A man of taste.
# My girl # Talkin' 'bout # My girl # My girl I checked the obits.
|Nothing makes a likely candidate.
They're picky for guys|who had three heads to begin with.
- Formaldehyde.
|- Come again?
Formaldehyde.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
It|accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
After a couple of days they're useless.
|They're gonna need something fresh.
- How fresh?
|- As fresh as possible.
Buffy, you don't think Anyone who cuts dead girls into pieces|does not get the benefit of any doubt.
- I wanna end it now.
|- I second that.
You guys go to Eric's.
|We'll go to Chris's and meet up.
- I'm supposed to be at the "big game".
|- Fine.
Go ahead.
We'll take care of this.
- Yes, but shouldn't I I'm|- OK, then why don't we all meet there?
Fine.
Yes.
Buffy?
Don't be too hard on Chris.
|I mean, he's not a vampire.
No, he's just a ghoul.
Hi.
Um, I'm a friend of Chris's.
|I kinda need to talk to him.
D'you know if he's home?
So, is he home?
Westbury game.
November 11th, '95.
Daryl rushed 185 yards that night.
Four TDs.
He was MVP and he made|all-city that season.
Yeah, that was a great one.
|But is Chris home?
I don't know.
Is today a school day?
Oh, watch!
Watch this move!
Daryl takes a kick-off.
|He sheds one, two, three defenders.
And he breaks into the open field|for a 95-yard touchdown.
He would have been 19 next week.
Cordelia.
- Cordelia, are you coming?
|- Yeah, I'll be right out.
Oh, God.
Chris, you scared me.
What are you doing in here?
Is something wrong?
- Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia?
|- She has a game to think about.
She doesn't need losers like you.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- Are you OK?
|- Oh, my God, Buffy.
He's gone.
I was on my way to the field when|Chris came in and someone jumped me.
Sh.
Relax, take it easy.
That's the fight song.
It's time for|the cheerleader pyramid.
I gotta go.
- Are you sure you're OK to go out there?
|- Yeah, I have to go.
I'm the apex!
Chris?
I know what you're trying to do, ..
you and Eric.
I know about the bodies from the cemetery.
But you haven't hurt anyone yet.
Look, I know what it's like|to lose someone that you're close to.
But that's no excuse.
- What you're doing is wrong.
|- I have to do this for him.
- He needs someone.
|- Eric?
He needs industrial-strength therapy!
He always looked out for me, ..
stood up for me.
He's all alone.
Everybody loved him and now he's all alone.
Who are you talking Oh, my God.
You promised me!
You promised!
I wouldn't have to be alone!
It's not too late.
Nothing's changed.
|We can still do this, you and me.
Your brother's not the only one|who can create life.
What d'you say?
Let's go scare you up a date.
Daryl?
Daryl?
Daryl!
He's not here.
Where else could he be?
But he would never go out.
- Unless|- He's gonna pick up where you left off.
Go, Greenbacks, go!
Go, team, go!
Go, team, go!
I don't know why football does it for me.
I mean, it lacks the grace of basketball,|the poetry of baseball.
At its best, it's unadorned aggression.
|It's such a rugged contest.
- Rugged?
American football?
|- And that's funny because?
No, I just think it's rather odd that|a nation that prides itself on its virility ..
should feel compelled to strap on 40lbs|of protective gear just in order to play rugby.
Is this your normal strategy for a first date:|dissing my county's national pastime?
Did you just say "date"?
- You noticed that, huh?
|- Hi, Ms Calendar.
Hi, Giles.
- Hey.
What's up?
|- Eric's was a bust.
Nothing there.
Just computer equipment and a pornography|collection so prodigious it even scared me, - Did Buffy get back yet?
|- No.
Uh, no.
Perhaps you should, uh, circulate|nearer the field and see what you can find.
So what's the score?
- I don't see her.
Do you?
|- No.
Please, what's going on?
Just take off the blindfold.
|I promise I won't scream.
I promise.
- She's beautiful.
|- No!
It's bad luck to see|the bride before the wedding.
Please, just take off the blindfold.
|I promise I won't scream.
I promise.
Cordelia Scream all you want.
|We're in an abandoned building.
Help!
OK, that's enough.
You were always good to me,|always noticed me, but I ignored you.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad I have|a second chance to tell you that.
D-Daryl?
I was thoughtless.
I see that now.
But I've changed.
I've learned to appreciate how much it meant|that you wanted to be with me.
- We're ready.
|- Ready?
Ready for what?
You're gonna feel a pinch,|maybe some discomfort around the neck.
But don't worry.
When you wake up|you'll have the body of a 17-year-old.
In fact, you'll have the body of several.
He was here, Chris.
Where did he take her?
- To the rest of the body.
To the lab.
|- Where is that?
- I promised him|- He'll kill Cordelia!
You can't just give and take lives like that.
|It's not your job.
He's in the old science lab.
|Everything's set up there.
Thank you.
Now find Xander and Willow,|and tell them what's going on.
Daryl, please.
You don't have to do this.
We have to, so we can be together.
We'll be together anyway.
|I'll be with you, I promise.
- Is that right?
|- Uh-huh.
You see anything you like?
When you're finished, you won't go out, you|won't run away, but we can hide together.
- Please.
Please!
|- Sterile enough for government work.
No!
No!
Buffy, help me!
Daryl, I know what you're doing.
|Your brother sent me.
He wouldn't do that.
My brother loves me.
- They're crazy.
|- It's OK.
I'll get you out.
No, I'm not done with her yet.
I'm not finished!
I won't live alone!
- I'm gettin' outta here!
|- You have to help me.
Let go!
- Buffy!
|- Get Cordelia!
Xander!
Get me out of here!
Come on, Xander, come on!
|Come on!
Get it off!
Get it off!
Get me out of here!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Daryl!
Don't!
- Sh-she's mine!
|- Daryl!
Daryl!
No.
We'll be together always.
No.
Mine.
The first time he woke up, after ..
he said I shouldn't have brought him back.
I was just trying to look out for him, ..
like he would have done for me.
I saw the fire.
I figured you'd be here.
- Is everyone OK?
|- Yeah.
We're OK.
- Sorry about all this.
|- It's OK.
Although a good rule of thumb ..
for a first date is don't do anything so|exciting it'll be hard to top on a second date.
Since I've moved to live on the Hellmouth, ..
the events of this evening|actually qualify as a slow night.
Did you just say "second date"?
You noticed that, huh?
I guess that makes it official.
|Everybody's paired off.
Vampires get dates.
Hell, even the|school librarian sees more action than me.
Ever think the world's like musical chairs and|we're the only ones who don't have a chair?
- All the time.
|- Xander.
I just wanted to thank you for saving my life.
What you did in there|was really brave and heroic.
- If there is anything I could ever do to|- Do you mind?
We're talkin' here.
- So, where were we?
|- Wondering why we never get dates.
Yeah.
So, why do you think that is?
God, the whole thing was so creepy.
But, at the same time,|I mean, he did do it all for his brother.
Sounds like|he took it a little over the edge.
- Love makes you do the wacky.
|- What?
Crazy stuff.
Crazy like a 241-year-old|being jealous of a high-school junior?
Are you 'fessing up?
I thought about it.
|Maybe it bothers me a little.
- I don't love Xander.
|- Yeah, but he's in your life.
He gets to be there when I can't.
Take your classes, eat your meals,|hear your jokes and complaints.
He gets to see you in the sunlight.
I don't look that good in direct light.
It'll be morning soon.
I should probably go.
I could walk you home.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
In every generation there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, A lot of educators tell students|"Think of your principal as your pal".
I say "Think of me as your judge,|jury and executioner".
Tell me, who do you think is the most|troublesome student in this school?
Well, it is quite a match between you two.
On the one hand, Buffy hasn't stabbed|a horticulture teacher with a trowel.
I didn't stab anyone with a trowel.
|They were pruning shears.
On the other hand, Sheila has|never burnt down a school building.
Well, that was never proven.
The fire|marshal said it coulda been mice.
Mice that were smoking?
The two of you seem to be tied|in the class-cutting and fight-starting events.
- It's quite exciting.
|- What does the winner get?
Expelled.
Thursday is parent-teacher night.
Your parents, assuming you have any, ..
will meet your teachers,|assuming you have any left.
I've decided to put the two of you|in charge of this event.
You have three days|to prepare refreshments, make banners ..
and transform the school lounge|into a habitable place for adults.
This will incur my goodwill and may affect|what I tell your parents when I meet them.
- Are we clear?
|- I'm clear.
Don't you feel clear?
- We're very clear.
|- Good.
Because you mess up this time and your|parents will be cleaning out your lockers.
It shouldn't be that hard.
We can|work on the banners at lunch tomorrow.
Yeah, sure.
Whatever.
Hey, meat pie!
- Snyder's got you makin' party favours, huh?
|- His two worst students.
That's what my mom sees|when she looks at me.
A Sheila.
Sheila's definitely intense.
|That's the guy she can bring home to Mother.
She was already smoking in fifth grade.
|Once I was lookout for her.
- You're bad to the bone.
|- I'm a rebel.
It's not fair.
I'm a slayer.
It requires|a certain amount of cutting and fighting.
- What's Sheila's excuse?
|- Homework.
She won't do it.
Most teachers respect that.
Keep away any sharp implements|when you're with her.
Do you think any other slayers|had to go to high school?
You'll have a nice soiree.
As long as nothing|bad happens until then, you'll be fine.
Are you crazy?
|Now something bad is gonna happen.
- Nothing's gonna happen.
|- Not until some dummy says what you said.
- It's the ultimate jinx.
|- What were you thinking?
Or were you even thinking at all?
Well, you guys don't know.
|Maybe this time it'll be different.
Home sweet home.
The Master is dead.
|Someone has to take his place.
As long as the Slayer's alive, whoever|takes his place will be sharing his grave.
Then let the soul who kills her|wear his mantle.
Can you do it?
Yes.
This weekend, the Night of St Vigeous, ..
our power shall be at its peak.
When I kill her, it'll be|the greatest event since the Crucifixion.
And I should know.
I was there.
You were there?
Please!
If every vampire who said he was|at the Crucifixion was actually there, ..
it would have been like Woodstock.
I oughta rip your throat out.
I was actually at Woodstock.
That was a weird gig.
I fed off a flower person, and I spent|the next six hours watchin' my hand move.
So, who do you kill for fun around here?
- Who are you?
|- Spike.
You're that Anointed guy.
I've read about you.
You've got slayer problems.
|That's a bad piece of luck.
Do you know what I find works real good|with slayers?
Killing them.
- Can you?
|- A lot faster than nancy boy there.
Yeah, I did a couple of slayers in my time.
|I don't like to brag.
Who am I kidding?
I love to brag.
There was this one slayer|during the Boxer Rebellion, and Drusilla.
You shouldn't be walking around.
|You're weak.
Look at all the people.
- Are these nice people?
|- We're gettin' along.
This one has power.
I could feel it from the outside.
Yeah.
He's the big noise in these parts.
|Anointed, and all that.
Do you like daisies?
I plant them but they always die.
Everything I put in the ground|withers and dies.
Spike?
I'm cold.
I got you.
I'm a princess.
That's what you are.
Me and Dru, we're movin' in.
Now Any of you want to test who's got|the biggest wrinklies round here, ..
step on up.
I'll do your slayer for you.
But you keep your flunkies from|tryin' anything behind my back.
Deal?
I can't see her.
The Slayer I can't see.
It's dark where she is.
Kill her.
Kill her, Spike.
- Kill her for me?
|- It's done, baby.
Kill her for Princess?
I'll chop her into messes.
You are my sweet.
My little Spike.
So, how about this slayer?
Is she tough?
What's wrong?
I spent a good part of my allowance on this|cream rinse, and it's neither creamy nor rinsy.
- Life is hard, dear.
|- Don't I know it.
- Is that a split end?
|- I got the mail.
- Good.
|- A reminder about parent-teacher night.
- Thursday.
|- Less good.
Which you were planning on|telling me about?
Oh, for the last two weeks.
Uh-huh.
So, what do you think|your teachers are gonna tell me about you?
Well, I think they'll all agree ..
that I always bring a pen to class,|ready to absorb their knowledge.
This absorption rate.
How is it|reflected in your homework and test scores?
What can you tell about|a person from a test score?
- Whether she'll ever see her friends again.
|- Oh, that.
- I look forward to meeting your principal.
|- Won't that be something.
Look, sweetheart.
Life is more than grades, and homework,|and not getting kicked out of school.
But we moved once|because of you getting in trouble, ..
and I had to start a new business, not|to mention a new life, in a whole new town.
And you don't want to do it again.
What I don't want is to be|disappointed in you again.
Mom, that's the last thing that I want, too.
I'm trying, I really am.
I just|I have a lot of pressure on me right now.
Wait till you get a job.
Sleep tight.
I have a job.
Sheila's a no-show?
She goes to this really rank bar,|the Fish Tank.
Sometimes they have raids,|and other stuff that could make you tardy.
Could you help me|cram some French tonight?
I don't want Mr DeJean|telling my mother I'm an imbecile.
I thought we were going to the Bronze.
|You thought Angel might show?
He'll meet some other nice girl.
|Studying comes first.
We're going to the Bronze.
I can study, and party, and do parent-|teacher night, as long as I don't have to - Buffy!
|- ..
fight vampires.
There is nothing in the Chronicles|about an extraneous lunar cycle.
The Order never accurately calculated|the Mesopotamian calendar.
- Read something published after 1066.
|- Very funny.
What's the up, guys?
Miss Calendar has been|surfing on her computer ..
and, according to her,|this Saturday is the Night of St Vigeous.
Let me guess.
|He didn't make balloon animals.
No, he led a crusade of of vampires.
They swept through Edessa,|Haran, and points east.
- And didn't leave much behind.
|- If I survive parent-teacher night, ..
I'll see what I can do about Saturday.
You're being a tad flip, don't you think?
|This is serious.
And getting kicked out of school|is laughs aplenty?
You know what happens when you let|your life interfere with your slaying.
Well, if my slaying doesn't get me expelled,|I promise banner-making won't get me killed.
- Just let me get through this week.
|- Saturday needs a great deal of preparation.
- Well, we'll help.
|- Yeah.
I'll whittle stakes.
- I can research stuff.
|- And while I'm whittling, ..
I plan to whistle a jaunty tune.
Your help will be greatly appreciated.
But Buffy must fight alone.
|You are, after all, the Slay Ssslave Slaves.
You're all slaves|to the, uh television.
- Yes.
|- Young people nowadays.
Shall we go?
You wouldn't be helping Buffy|in Sheila's place, would you?
- No.
|- We're hindering.
She ditched.
Mmm.
I feel an expulsion coming on.
No, actually, Sheila's|been helping us for hours.
She just went out|to get some more paint.
Oh!
Oh, is there no more teal in the art room?
I know you wanted everything to be perfect,|but let's go with what we have.
Just make sure|everything is perfect on Thursday.
Thanks for covering.
|The guy's a serious rodent.
No problem.
Did you really burn down|a school building one time?
Well not actually one time.
Cool.
# A drink you can't resist # And in your head La vâche doit me touche ..
de la jeudi, - Was it wrong?
Should I use the plural?
|- No, but You said "The cow should|touch me from Thursday".
- Maybe that's what I was feeling.
|- Then you said it wrong.
Oh, je stink.
You're just not focused.
It's Angel missage.
Well, he didn't say for sure.
It was|a "Maybe see you there" kind of deal.
Guys, I'm all alone out there.
|Dance with me.
- Well, we are studying.
|- One dance.
- You've been studying nearly 12 minutes.
|- No wonder my brain's fried.
Come on.
# I-hi-hi did a stupid thing last night # I called you # A moment of weakness # No, not a moment,|more like three months of weakness # I'm one step away|from crashin' to my knees # One step away|from spillin' my guts to you Go get something to eat.
Where's the phone?
I need to call the police.
|There's some big guy tryin' to bite someone.
- Slayer.
|- Slayee.
Get her out of here!
And a stake would be nice!
I don't need to wait for St Vigeous.
You're mine.
Spike!
Give me a hand.
Buffy!
Nice work, love.
- Who are you?
|- You'll find out on Saturday.
What happens on Saturday?
I kill you.
All right.
Which one's Dwayne|and which one's Dell?
Don't tell me.
Dell's the one with the tattoos.
You guys weren't lyin'|about havin' a Cadillac, were you?
Cos I'm crazy about a Cad.
Just the feel of the leather makes me wanna Where'd you go?
What's going on?
Where are you guys?
Not funny.
- Who are you?
|- Who do you want me to be?
- Did you see|- Those two losers ..
who thought they were|good enough for you?
- What happened to 'em?
|- They got sleepy.
- Huh?
|- And you ..
got something a whole lot better.
Hey!
Wait up.
What's your name?
Spike That's what|the other vampire called him?
- That's a little unorthodox, isn't it?
|- Maybe he's Reform.
Perhaps he went by another name|in times past.
Well, whoever he is,|we'll need all the help we can get.
So, this Night of St Vigeous deal.
If they're gonna attack in force,|aren't we thinking "vacation"?
That would be wrong.
Could we hide?
I mean, if that Spike guy|is leading the attack He can't be any worse|than any other creature.
He's worse.
Once he starts something, he doesn't stop|until everything in his path is dead.
Hm.
So he's thorough, goal-oriented.
We were at the Bronze before.
|Thought you said you might show.
You said you weren't sure if you were goin'.
I was being cool.
Come on.
You've been|dating for what, like 200 years?
You don't know what a girl means|when she says "Maybe"?
Wow.
Two centuries of dating.
If you only had two a year, that's still|like 400 dates with 400 different Why do they call it a mace?
We do have slightly|more urgent matters to discuss.
Like keeping my mom|away from Snyder tomorrow night.
And not dying Saturday.
Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow|goes under any other name?
OK, that's it.
I'm puttin' a collar|with a little bell on that guy.
St Vigeous,|you who murdered so many, ..
we beseech you,|cleanse us of our weaknesses.
Mercy, compassion, pity Miss Edith speaks out of turn.
She's a bad example,|and will have no cakes today.
- Darling, are you going to eat something?
|- I'm not hungry.
- I miss Prague.
|- You nearly died in Prague.
Idiot mob.
This is the place for us.
The Hellmouth will restore you, ..
put colour in your cheeks,|metaphorically speaking, ..
and in a few weeks' time The stars will align and smile down on us.
And then God, this town will burn.
A pretty fire.
- They're preparing.
|- St Vigeous is coming up.
Should be a party.
- You should go up with them and cleanse.
|- Dru The boy doesn't trust you.
They follow him.
I think sometimes that|all my hair will fall out and I'll be bald.
Never happen.
All right, I'll go up|and get chanty with the fellas.
But you got to do me one favour.
Eat something.
You see, Miss Edith?
If you'd been good,|you could watch with the rest.
"For three nights the unholy ones|scourge themselves into a fury, ..
culminating in a savage attack|on the Night of St Vigeous".
Remember when Saturday night|meant date night?
- You sure don't.
|- Parents start arriving in an hour.
OK.
So, banners are in place,|the lounge is comfy.
- What am I forgetting?
|- Punch?
- Punch!
I need punch!
|- My fingers are cramping.
- How long have I been doing this?
|- Three minutes.
Can I go now?
|She doesn't need this many stakes.
If this guy Spike is as mean as you said,|it should be over pretty quickly.
We're still all rooting for you on Saturday.
|I'd be there myself if I didn't have a leg wax.
You guys hold down the fort.
|I'm punchbound.
No.
- What kind of punch did you make?
|- Lemonade.
I made it fresh.
How much sugar did you use?
Sugar?
It's very good.
OK.
Now all I have to do is keep|my mother and Snyder from crossing paths.
- Mrs Summers.
|- Hi, Willow.
Hi, honey.
- Did you, uh do all this?
|- Yeah.
Um Here.
Have some lemonade.
Right after Willow shows you the library.
|I have to stay here and hostess.
Right, the library.
Uh|Oh, no.
Giles and everyone Is locked in there studying.
|Right.
French class it is.
- Was that your mother?
|- Here Oh!
Oh, sorry!
Um Yeah.
I was gonna introduce you,|but she wouldn't have said much.
She doesn't speak a word of English.
Giles has us locked in there|working on your weapons.
Even slaves get minimum wage.
- What?
|- You're starting to look a little slagged.
What, are you just|skipping foundation entirely now?
Cordelia, I have at least three lives|to contend with, none of which mesh.
It's kind of like oil, and water,|and a third unmeshable thing.
Yeah.
And I can see the oil.
Is that your mom?
Now that is a woman|that knows how to moisturise.
Did it, like, skip a generation?
Well, I believe that I have seen|every classroom on campus.
And, just as I get there, all your teachers|miraculously have stepped out.
But you haven't seen the boiler room.
And that's really interesting, what with|the boiler being in the room and all.
Hi.
I'm Joyce Summers.
I'm Buffy's mother.
Principal Snyder.
I'm afraid we need to talk.
|My office is down here.
- He didn't look very happy.
|- But you did such a good job.
- When they're done talking|- What?
My guess?
Tenth high-school reunion?
|You'll still be grounded.
Cordelia.
Have some lemonade.
Oh, there you are.
There who is?
Our new friend Spike.
He's known as William the Bloody.
Earned his nickname by torturing his victims|with railroad spikes.
Very pleasant.
Oh, here's some good news.
He's barely 200.
|He's not even as old as Angel is.
- Oh|- That's a bad look, right?
I think your suggestion of running away|this Saturday might have been a good one.
Spike has fought two slayers|in the last century, and ..
he's killed them both.
In the car - now.
What can I say?
I couldn't wait.
Nobody gets out, especially the girl!
Everybody this way.
Come on!
Come on!
!
Hey!
- What the hell?
|- It's Spike and his army!
Look out!
Get back!
In here!
Now!
- We cut the power.
Nobody got out.
|- And the Slayer?
She either went that way or that way.
|I saw two others.
You don't know?
I'm a veal kind of guy.
You're too old to eat.
But not to kill.
I feel better.
They've cut the phones.
Wait a minute.
There's a boarded-up cellar|behind the stacks.
You can get out that way.
Find Angel.
We need him.
Not until I know|Buffy and Willow are all right.
No one will be all right|unless we get some help.
- Who are those people?
What do they want?
|- Is something wrong with their faces?
Yes!
PCP.
- It's a gang on PCP.
We've got to get out.
|- You can't go outside.
They'll kill you.
- You don't tell me.
I tell you,|- They will kill everybody in this room.
Nobody goes out, nobody comes in|until I say so.
Do you hear me?
Who do you think you are?
I'm the one that knows how to stop them.
Are you crazy?
I know you've been accused|of fighting, but those guys are serious.
- You can't go out there.
|- I know.
That's why I'm going up there.
Don't worry, Mom.
Slayer?
Here, kitty, kitty.
I find one of your friends first,|I'm gonna suck 'em dry.
And use their bones to bash your head in.
Are you getting a word picture here?
Oh God!
Oh God!
Spike!
Listen.
Someone's in the ceiling Hey!
What are you doing?
|There are three vampires out there.
God only knows|how many others in the building.
I am the Watcher.
|I am responsible for her, and I have to go.
Rupert?
- Be careful.
|- Push these back as soon as I Buffy!
You're all right.
- How are the others?
|- Snyder, my mother and four others ..
are locked in the science room.
Willow and Cordelia ran the other way.
|I don't know if they're - Where's Xander?
|- He got out.
He's getting Angel.
Good.
OK.
I'm gonna|take the vamps out in the hall.
Get my mom and the others|out the same way.
- Let me help you.
|- Giles, my mother's in that room.
If I don't make it,|I know you'll make sure she does.
Bloody right I will.
|Fair enough.
What's your plan?
Well, they split up to hold us here,|so I'm gonna take 'em one on one.
Set 'em up, and knock 'em down.
Watch your back.
- Why don't you sit down?
|- This is my school.
What I say goes,|and I say this is not happening.
- Well, then, I guess the danger's over.
|- I'm not waiting for them.
- I'm gettin' out!
|- Don't be an idiot.
I'm beginning to see a certain|mother-daughter resemblance.
- No!
Look, you heard what Buffy said.
|- She's a student.
What does she know?
The, uh door is solid.
Use your head.
You!
Come with me.
I did it!
You know a lot about this Spike guy|so, um you got a plan?
Good plan.
- I think he's gone.
|- He could come back.
What are we gonna do?
Pray?
Hey!
Guard the door.
I'm almost in.
- Buffy, are you OK?
|- I'm fine, Mom.
Buffy, get out of here, OK?
|We'll be all right.
Look, just hang on for one more minute|until I tell you to open the door.
Sheila!
Where have you been?
Sorry I'm late.
|There's some really weird guys outside.
Sh!
Yeah, I know.
They're trying to kill us.
This should be fun.
- Angelus!
|- Spike.
I'll be damned!
I taught you to always guard your perimeter.
|You should have someone out there.
I did.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
- What's new with you?
|- Everything.
- Come up against this slayer yet?
|- She's cute.
Not too bright, though.
|Gave the puppy-dog, "I'm all tortured" act.
Keeps her off my back when I feed.
People still fall for that|Anne Rice routine?
What a world!
I knew you were lyin'.
Undead liar guy!
Wanna bite before we kill her?
Hm?
Stay behind me.
Buffy, look out!
Mom, now!
Come on, let's go.
- Get them out.
|- You're coming too.
- In a minute.
Go!
|- Buffy!
Haven't seen you|in the killing fields for an age.
- I'm not much for company.
|- No, you never were.
- So, why are you so scared of this slayer?
|- Scared?
Yeah.
Time was you would have taken her|out in a heartbeat.
Now look at you.
I mean, this tortured thing|is an act, right?
You're not housebroken?
I saw her kill the Master.
Hey, you think you can take her alone?
Be my guest.
I'll just feed and run.
Don't be silly.
We're old friends.
We'll do it together.
Let's drink to it.
You think you can fool me?
You were my sire, man!
You were my Yoda!
- Things change.
|- Not us!
Not demons.
Man, I can't believe this!
You Uncle Tom!
Come on, people!
This isn't a spectator sport.
Fee, fi, fo, fum.
I smell the blood of a nice, ripe girl.
- Do we really need weapons for this?
|- I just like them.
They make me feel all manly.
The last slayer I killed She begged for her life.
You don't strike me as the begging kind.
You shouldn't have come here.
No.
I messed up your doilies and stuff.
But I just got so bored.
I'll tell you what.
As a personal favour|from me to you, I'll make it quick.
- It won't hurt a bit.
|- No, Spike.
It's gonna hurt a lot.
Come on, everyone.
This way.
Now that hurt.
But not as much as this will.
You get the hell away from my daughter.
Women!
Nobody lays a hand on my little girl.
Take care of this.
- Hello, Bob.
|- It's over.
They all got away.
I got a body inside, and I got|another one on the south lawn.
- Looks like he was pulled through a window.
|- I told him not to go through that window.
Well, another wonderful fun-filled evening.
Yes You know, um I will understand|if you decide to start avoiding me.
So when you gave him my neck to chew on,|why didn't you clock him?
I couldn't make the first move.
|I had to see if he was buying it or not.
- And if he bit me?
What then?
|- We would have known he bought it.
What's the deal with you|being Spike's sire?
What's a sire?
I need to say something to the media people.
- So?
|- So, do you want the usual story?
- Gang-related?
PCP?
|- What'd you have in mind?
The truth?
Right Gang-related.
PCP.
So What did you|and Principal Snyder talk about, anyway?
Principal Snyder said|you were a troublemaker.
And I could care less.
I have|a daughter who can take care of herself.
Who's brave, and resourceful,|and thinks of others in a crisis.
No matter who you hang out with or what|dumb stuff you think you need to do, ..
I'm gonna sleep better knowing all that.
But how long till this wears off|and you start ragging on me again?
- At least a week and a half.
|- Very cool.
And if you get me out of this, I swear|I'll never be mean to anyone ever again.
Unless they really deserve it.
|Or if it's that time of the month.
In which case I don't think you|or anyone else can hold me responsible.
- Ask for some aspirin.
|- And can you please send some asp Hey!
- Spike, did she hurt you?
|- It was close, baby, but Aw.
Come here.
A slayer with family and friends.
|That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure.
You'll kill her.
And then|we'll have a nice celebration.
- Yeah.
A party.
|- Yeah.
With streamers, and songs.
- How's the Annoying One?
|- He doesn't wanna play.
It figures.
Well, I suppose I'd better go make nice.
- You failed.
|- I, um I offer penance.
Penance?
You should lay down your life.
Our numbers are depleted.
The Feast of St|Vigeous has been ruined by your impatience!
I was rash.
And if I had to do it all over again Who am I kidding?
I would do it exactly the same, ..
only I'd do this first.
No!
From now on, ..
we're gonna have a little less ritual, ..
and a little more fun around here.
Let's see what's on TV.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
In every generation there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, - This is so unfair.
|- I don't think it's that bad.
It's the übersuck.
|Mom could have at least warned me.
A lot of parents are doing it.
|It's part of this cultural-exchange megillah.
- The exhibit.
The dance.
|- I have the best costume for the dance.
A stranger in my house for two weeks.
I'm gonna be insane.
A danger|to myself and others within three days!
I think the exchange-student|programme's cool.
I do!
It's a beautiful melding of two cultures.
Have you ever done|an exchange programme?
My dad tried to sell me|to some Armenians once.
Does that count?
Ooh!
There's mine.
Sven.
Isn't he lunchable?
|Mine's definitely the best.
- What are you looking at?
|- Our exchange students.
So how's yours?
Visually, I mean.
I don't know.
Guy-like.
By guy-like, we are talking|big, beefy guy-like girls, right?
I was just told "guy".
You didn't look at him first?
|He could be dogly.
You live on the edge!
Hold on a sec.
So this person who's|living with you for two weeks is a man?
With man parts?
This is a terrible idea.
What about the beautiful|melding of two cultures?
There's no melding, OK?
|He better keep his parts to himself.
What's he doing?
That's Rodney Munson.
|He's God's gift to the bell curve.
What he lacks in smarts,|he makes up in lack-of-smarts.
You just don't like him cos of that time|he beat you up every day for five years.
Yeah.
I'm irrational that way.
- I better stop him before he gets in trouble.
|- I got it.
Non-violence is probably better.
I wasn't gonna use violence.
|I don't always use violence.
- Do I?
|- The important thing is you believe that.
What are you Oh, Willow, hi.
That's probably not something you|should be doing.
You could get in trouble.
Oh, no.
And they might|kick me out of school?
Are we still on for our chem tutorial?
Yeah.
I think I got almost|all 14 natural elements memorised.
There are 103.
Welcome, students.
We shall now|proceed into the Incan burial chamber.
The human sacrifice is about to begin.
Typical museum trick.
Promise|human sacrifice.
Deliver old pots and pans.
..
to become their princess.
I hope this story ends with|"And she lived happily ever after".
No, I think it ends with "And she became|a scary, discoloured, shrivelled mummy".
The Incan people sacrificed their|princess to the mountain god, Sabancaya, an offering buried alive|for eternity in this dark tomb.
They could have at least wrapped her in those|nice, white bandages - like in the movies.
The princess remained there,|protected only by a cursed seal ..
placed there as a warning|to any who would wake her.
So, when's exchange-o boy|making his appearance?
His name's Ampata.
|He'll be at the bus station tomorrow night.
Oooh!
The Sunnydale bus depot.
Classy!
What a way to introduce someone|to our county - with the stench of urine.
Now, if you'll follow me this way, please.
Cool!
Damn!
- So can I go?
|- I think not.
- How come?
|- Because you are the Chosen One.
Just this once, I'd like|to be the Overlooked One.
Well, I'm afraid that is not - You have responsibilities.
|- Oh!
I know this one!
"Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah,|bitty blah.
I'm so stuffy, give me a scone".
It's as if you know me.
Your secret identity will be difficult to|maintain while this student is living with you.
Not ..
with her.
In the same house as her.
Am I the only one who's objective|enough to make that distinction?
So, going to the dance like a normal person|would be the best way to keep that secret.
Giles, come on!
Budge.
|No one likes an un-budger.
Fine!
- Go.
|- Yay!
I win.
I'll just go and introduce|my shoulder to an ice pack.
So I guess we're dance-bound.
Cool.
I think|I can get my mom's car, so I'm Wheel Man.
- I thought you were taking Willow?
|- Yeah, I am.
But I'm not gonna "take" Willow|in the sense of "take me".
With you, everybody's safe.
|Without you, we're two.
Ah.
And we enter dateville.
|Romance, flowers.
Lips.
Oh, come on.
In all the years you've known|Willow, you've never thought about her lips?
Buffy, I love Willow|and she's my best friend, ..
which makes her not the kind of girl|who I think about her lips that much.
She's the kind of girl|that I'm best friends with.
Hey, guys.
Willow!
Hi!
|We were just talking about happy things.
Like the three of us|going to the dance together, see?
Happy.
Not happy.
No.
Yes.
No.
Rodney's missing.
Trouble with Mr Munson again?
His parents say he never|came home last night.
I don't think I saw Rodney|on the bus back from the field trip.
I didn't either.
|I hope he didn't get in trouble at the museum.
Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy.
Right, and it rose from its tomb.
And attacked him.
On the other hand, maybe Rodney|just stepped out for a smoke.
- For 21 hours?
|- It's addictive, you know.
We'll deal with that|when we've ruled out evil curses.
One day I'm gonna live in a town where evil|curses are just ruled out without even saying.
- Where was the seal?
|- It was right here.
And it's broken.
- Does that mean the mummy's loose?
|- No.
Comfy as ever.
Look at this series of pictograms.
- OK.
I just saved us, right?
|- Something did.
We'll fret about the details later.
Let's|just get out of here before he comes back.
Giles, ..
were the Incas very advanced?
Yes.
Yes, very.
Did they have orthodontists?
Rodney looked like he had been dead|for 500 years.
How could that be?
Maybe we should ask that crazy man|with the big old knife.
I don't think he seemed overly chatty.
The way he bolted when he saw Rodney,|I'd say he was as freaked as we were.
My resources on the subject are limited.
I gather this mummy was from the Sabancaya|region of eastern Peru.
It's very remote.
- If there's an answer, then it's locked in|- In the seal.
It could take me weeks|to translate these pictograms.
- Well, we'll start tonight with|- Ampata.
- I was gonna suggest hunting.
|- No, I'm late.
I'm picking him up.
Buffy, where are your priorities?
Finding a mummifying killer or making time|for a Latin lover skilled in breaking hearts?
Ampata's alone.
|I don't know how good his English is.
He's from South South America.
- Maybe he could translate the seal.
|- Oh, yeah.
Fall for the old "let me translate|that ancient seal" come-on.
Do you know how many times I've used that?
Ampata!
Ampata!
Hello?
- 40 minutes late.
Welcome to America.
|- What if he left already?
Ampata!
Ampata Gutierrez?
Do we have to speak Spanish|when we see him?
Cos I don't know anything much|besides "Doritos" and "Chihuahua".
- Ampata!
|- Here.
Hello.
I am Ampata.
Ay caramba!
I can also say that.
Dining room.
And this - ..
is kitchen.
|- It's very good.
Yeah, you got your stove, your fridge.
|It's fully functional.
We're very into it.
- Would you like a drink?
|- Let's see.
We've got milk and older milk.
- Juice?
|- Please.
So, Ampata, ..
you're a girl.
Yes.
For many years now.
And not a boy.
Cos we thought a boy was|coming, and here you are in a girl way.
It's just one of those crazy mix-ups, Will.
- So, have you ever been to America before?
|- Uh I have toured.
Where did you go?
I was taken to Atlanta, Boston, New York.
New York!
That's exciting.
|What was that like?
I did not see so much.
Your English is very bueno, - I listen much.
|- That works out well because I talk much.
Hey.
- Sorry about the teeniness of the room.
|- My old one was much smaller.
What's it like back home?
Cramped and very dead.
Well, you'll feel right at home in Sunnydale.
Oh, no!
But But you have so much here.
How about friends?
They're It is just me.
I've been there.
But, hey,|you'll meet lots of people tomorrow.
Thank you.
You must teach me|everything about your life.
I want to fit in, Buffy.
|Just like you.
A normal life.
One normal life coming up.
Devon, I told you I'd be at the dance tonight|but I am not one of your groupies.
I won't be all doe-eyed, looking up at you,|standing at the edge of the stage.
- Got it.
|- So, I'll see you afterwards?
- Sure.
Where do you wanna meet?
|- I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
With that guy?
Sven.
Momento, Needa.
This student exchange|has been a horrible nightmare.
They don't even speak American.
So I'll see you later?
Bye.
Sven!
Come!
- Oz, man.
What do you think?
|- Of what?
Cordelia, man!
She's a wonderland tour.
- You gotta admit, the girl is hot.
|- Yeah, she's a hot girl.
Let me guess.
Not your type?
|What does a girl have to do to impress you?
Well, it involves a feather boa|and the theme to A Summer Place, - I can't discuss it here.
|- You're too picky.
Do you know how many girls you could|have?
You're lead guitar.
It's currency.
I'm not picky.
You're just impressed|by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.
She doesn't have to talk.
I worked really hard on my costume.
|It's pretty cool.
OK, but what about me?
I gotta think.
A celebration of cultures has|lots of dress-up alternatives.
And an equal number|of mocking alternatives, all aimed at me.
- Bavarians are cool.
|- OK.
No shirts with ruffles, ..
no hats with feathers|and definitely no lederhosen.
They make my calves look fat.
Why are you suddenly so worried|about looking like an idiot?
That came out wrong.
Your first day at school.
Nervous?
It is more people|than I have seen in a long time.
Don't worry.
|You'll have no problems making friends.
As a matter of fact,|I know someone who's dying to meet you.
How do you do?
I was wondering if you could translate this?
That was in no way awkward.
- Is something wrong?
|- No.
It is - Why are you asking me?
|- Well, uh It's an artefact from your region.
It's from the tomb|of an Incan mummy, actually.
We're trying to translate it|as a project for our, um Our archaeology club.
- Very good.
|- It is broken.
Where are the other pieces?
That's all we found.
It's very old.
Valuable.
- You should hide it.
|- Is there anything you recognise here?
This, um|This chappie with a knife, for instance.
Well, I do not know exactly.
But I think this represents ..
I believe the word is bodyguard?
Bodyguard?
Interesting.
Legend has it that he guards the mummy|against those who would disturb her.
Well.
Yes, that's a very good|starting point for our, um club.
Oh!
And as club president, I have lots to do.
Lots of stuff.
Dull stuff.
- Willow, maybe you could|- Stay with Ampata for the day.
I'd love to.
Yes.
That will be fun.
I'll continue with the translation.
|Buffy, you research this bodyguard thing.
And, Willow Willow!
Boy, they really like each other.
And this ..
is called a snack food.
- Snack food?
|- It's a delicious, spongy, golden cake, ..
stuffed with a delightful,|creamy white substance of goodness.
And here's how you eat it.
Oh, but now I cannot try it.
That's why you bring two.
Here goes.
Good, huh?
The exciting part is they have|no ingredients that a human can pronounce.
So it doesn't leave you with|that heavy "food feeling" in your stomach.
- You are strange.
|- Girls always tell me that ..
right before they run away.
- I like it.
|- I like you like it.
Please, don't learn from my English.
Ha!
Or possible ha.
Do you think this matches?
Hey!
Yes.
I'm caring about mummies.
Ampata's only staying two weeks.
Yeah.
And then Xander can find|someone else who's not me to obsess about.
At least with you|I knew he didn't have a shot.
Well, you know, I have a choice.
I can spend my life waiting for Xander|to go out with every other girl in the world ..
until he notices me ..
or I can just get on with my life.
Good for you.
Well, I didn't choose yet.
Good Lord.
Good work.
- My work?
|- Yes.
This is most illuminating.
It seems Rodney's killer|might be the mummy.
- Where does it say that?
|- Well, here.
It implies that the mummy is capable|of feeding on the life force of a person.
Effectively freeze-dying them,|you might say.
- Extraordinary.
|- So we just have to stop the mummy.
Which leads to the question,|how do we  find and  stop the mummy?
The answer to that is somewhere still in here.
Or in the rest of the seal.
You stole the seal!
Where is it?
It is you.
- Here you are.
|- Thank you.
Why is this guy so into us?
|I mean, what's he want?
- He said "Give me the seal".
|- This is more popular than we realised.
I just don't know what we should do with it.
Destroy it.
If you do not, someone could die.
I'm afraid someone already has.
- The man with the knife killed someone?
|- Uh, no.
Well not exactly.
You are not telling me everything.
You're right, Ampata.
And it's time we do.
We're not an archaeology club.
We're in We're in the crime club, which is like the|chess club, only with crime and no chess.
Please understand me.
That seal nearly|got us killed.
It must be destroyed!
Ampata!
Ampata, listen to me.
|Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I won't let them.
Your investigation is dangerous.
|I do not want that.
Just normal life!
Is she OK?
Wigged.
I'm trying to convince her|that our lives aren't just danger around here.
- You should take her to the dance.
|- Good idea.
We'll all go.
- No, I mean just you.
|- But you were psyched.
And your costume.
I'll see you there.
You know what, Willow?
|You're my best friend.
I know.
I don't get it.
Why would the bodyguard|have such a jones for a broken piece of rock?
Well, um Perhaps he needs to put it together|with the other pieces.
If he has them.
I mean, we didn't find them.
If he didn't,|then they'd still be at the museum.
So maybe we should go there and find them.
|Odds are he'll show up too, right?
And hopefully, we'll be ready.
Hey!
Look at us!
|We came up with a plan.
A good plan.
- We'll meet there tonight after it closes.
|- No!
Bad plan.
I have other plans.
Dance plans.
Cancel plans.
OK.
I have something to tell you.
And it's kind of a secret|and it's a little bit scary.
I like you a lot.
And I want you to go with me to the dance.
Why was that so scary?
Well, you never know|if a girl's gonna say yes ..
or laugh in your face|and pull out your heart ..
and crush it into the ground with her heel.
Then you are very courageous.
- Can I tell you a secret?
|- Yeah.
- I like you, too.
|- Really?
- Really.
|- That's great!
Really?
- Really.
|- That's great!
You're not a praying mantis, are you?
Sorry.
Someone else.
- I will return to you.
|- Where are you going?
Where you cannot follow.
I'll wait outside.
I beg you - ..
do not kill me.
|- You are already dead.
For 500 years.
But it was not fair.
I was innocent.
The people you kill now so that|you may live they are innocent.
Please.
- I am in love.
|- You are the Chosen One.
You must die.
You have no choice.
Yes, I do.
I have thought.
The dance?
I will go with you.
Gladly.
Buffy, I do not have any lipstick.
You can borrow mine.
|There's some on the desk.
- What is that?
|- The station sent the rest of your stuff.
Of course.
I forgot all about it.
- I will unpack it later.
|- No worries.
I can do it.
But you must get ready for the dance.
- I'm not going.
|- Why not?
I have work to do.
Crime club work.
|It's nothing for you to worry about.
Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander.
- He seems very happy around you.
|- I am happy, too.
Mmm This one?
Oh, no.
That clashes.
|There should be a gold one there.
Thank you.
You're always thinking|of others before yourself.
You remind me of someone from|very long ago.
The Inca princess.
Cool.
A princess.
They told her that she was the only one.
That only she could defend her people|from the nether world.
Out of all the girls in her generation,|she was the only one - Chosen.
|- You know the story?
It's fairly familiar.
She was 16, like us.
She was offered|as a sacrifice and went to her death.
Who knows what she had to give up|to fulfil her duty to others?
What chance at love?
Who knows?
I'll unpack the rest of your stuff.
No, really.
Let me.
That's Xander and Willow.
I'll get it.
- I have come for the dance.
|- And what culture are you?
I'm from the county of Leone.
It's in Italy, pretending to be Montana.
- Are you from the county of white trash?
|- Mm.
New line-up.
You and Willow are taking Ampata.
|Giles and I are hunting mummies.
- Where's you and Willow?
|- She's not coming with us.
Oh!
On a date.
Romance.
Lips.
Hello, Xander.
I can translate American salivating boy-talk.
|He says you're beautiful.
You're welcome.
Ampata, don't you look wonderful!
Oh, I wish you could talk my daughter|into going with you.
I tried, but she is very stubborn.
Well, I'm glad someone else sees that.
Well, good night, then.
- Be careful.
|- I will.
Hey!
You look good.
Look at that.
Two days in America and Ampata|already seems like she belongs here.
She's really fitting in.
Yeah.
How about that.
Oh!
Near faux pas.
I almost wore the same thing.
- Hey.
Where's Sven?
|- I keep trying to ditch him.
He's like those dogs you leave|at the Grand Canyon on vacation.
They follow you back across four states.
See?
My own speechless human boomerang.
He's kinda cute.
|Maybe it's nice skipping all that small talk.
Small talk.
How about simple instructions?
Get punchy.
You.
Fruit drinky.
He can follow me.
Maybe I should have worn something sexy.
Wow.
You guys look great.
- I love your costume.
It's very authentic.
|- Thanks.
Yeah.
You look, um snug.
That's what I was going for.
Where's Buffy?
Thank heavens you're home.
Yep.
Not at the dance.
|Not with my friends.
Not with a life.
Why are you here?
|We were meeting later to find the bodyguard.
No.
He's already been found|in the school rest room, mummified.
Why would the mummy|kill her own bodyguard?
Well, I've cross-referenced|and I've looked at the pictograms anew.
He was a guard, but it was his job to ensure|that the mummy didn't awaken and escape.
So Ampata translated it wrong?
Perhaps.
Hold on a sec.
She was wiggy|about the seal from minute one.
Yes, I suppose she was.
- Her trunks!
|- I beg your pardon?
It's definitely all boys' clothes.
Why would a girl pack these?
How about this one?
What kind of girl|travels with a mummified corpse ..
and doesn't even pack lipstick?
Do you, um Would you like to, uh - You know.
|- I'd love to dance.
Hey.
That girl.
Who is she?
She's an exchange student.
|I think she's from South America.
No, not her.
The Eskimo.
- Come on!
Can't you put your foot down?
|- It is down.
One of these days|you're gonna have to get a grown-up car.
OK.
At least I can rule out something I said.
I should have guessed.
|Ampata wanted us to hide the seal.
Then she wanted us to destroy it because Oh, wait!
Uh waiting.
Well, we already know that the seal|was used to contain the mummy.
If breaking it freed her Reassembling it will trap her.
I'll go to the museum.
I'll drop you off.
|I'll try and piece together the fragments there.
OK.
I'll still get Xander before|he gets smoochy with mummy dearest.
Have you seen Ampata?
- What was that?
|- I shrugged.
Next time you should probably say "shrug".
Sigh.
I thought this exchange|would be a great deal.
But look what I got stuck with!
|"Momento", "Punchy fruity drinky".
Is Cordelia even from this county?
Your hands feel kinda rough.
Aren't you with Xander?
Does it look like I'm with Xander?
Ampata!
That's my cue to leave.
There you are.
Why'd you run away?
Because I do not deserve you.
What You think that you don't deserve me?
Man, I love you!
Are those tears of joy?
Pain?
Revulsion?
I am very happy.
And very sad.
Then talk to me.
Let me know what's wrong.
I can't.
Hey, I know why you can't tell me.
It's a secret, right?
|And if you told me, you'd have to kill me.
Oh!
That was a bad joke.
And the delivery was off, too.
I'm sorry.
I, uh I'm sorry.
No!
I can't.
Xander, I'm so sorry.
"Inca cosmology unites|the bird head with its paler twin".
Oh, here.
Its paler twin.
The seal.
- Where's Xander?
|- He's looking for Ampata.
We need to find him.
Ampata's the mummy.
Oh Good Xander!
- Where'd they go?
|- Backstage, I think.
Hey, I Who is that girl?
Are you OK?
I think so.
Boy, that was some kiss.
- Where's Ampata?
|- She said something about the seal.
- The seal.
Giles!
Come on.
|- What's going on?
- He doesn't know?
|- We'll tell him on the way.
There.
That's it.
Just one more piece.
I'll say one thing for you Incan mummies.
|You don't kiss and tell.
Looks like you've been|keeping secrets from me, - You're not a normal girl.
|- And you are?
This won't hurt.
Let her go!
If you're gonna kiss anybody,|it should be me.
Xander, we can be together.
Just Just let me have this one.
- That's never gonna happen.
|- I must do it.
I must do it now,|or it is the end for me and for us.
No!
You want life|you're gonna have to take mine.
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'm really the fun-talking guy today, huh?
- Sorry.
|- That's OK.
You don't have to talk.
I just, present company excluded, ..
I have the worst taste in women|of anyone in the world.
Ever.
Ampata wasn't evil.
At least not to begin with.
And I do think she cared about you.
Yeah, but that "sucking the life out of people"|thing would have been a problem.
She was gypped.
She was just a girl|and she had her life taken away from her.
I remember how I felt when I heard|the prophecy that I was gonna die.
I wasn't exactly obsessed|with doing the right thing.
Yeah, but you did.
You gave up your life.
I had you to bring me back.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, Is she dying?
I think she's singing.
To a telephone, in Hindi.
Now, that's entertainment.
Why is she singing?
She's sad because her lover gave her 12 gold|coins.
But the wizard cut open a bag of salt ..
and now the dancing minions have|nowhere to put their big maypole fish thing.
Uh-huh.
- Why is she singing?
|- Lover?
I thought that was her chiropractor?
Because of that thing he did with her feet?
|No, that was personal.
And we thought just because we didn't have|any money, this'd be a lacklustre evening.
We could go to the Bronze, sneak in|our own tea bags and ask for hot water.
Hop off the outlaw train,|before you land us in jail.
I, for one, am giddy and up.
|There's a kind of hush all over Sunnydale.
No demons or vampires to slay.
|I'm here with my friends.
So how does the water buffalo fit in again?
Callie!
Callie.
Where are you going?
The party's just gettin' started.
See?
Dr Debbi says when a man is speaking,|make serious eye contact and really listen.
And you laugh at everything he says.
- You dreamed about Angel again?
|- Third night in a row.
What did he do in the dream?
- Stuff.
|- Oh, stuff.
Was it one of those vivid dreams where|you could feel his lips and smell his hair?
It had surround sound!
- I'm just thinking about him so much lately.
|- You two are so right for each other.
- Except for the, uh|- Vampire thing.
That doesn't make him|a bad person necessarily.
I'm brainsick.
|I can't have a relationship with him!
Not during the day,|but you could ask him for coffee some night.
It's the non-relationship drink of choice.
|It's not a date.
It's a caffeinated beverage.
OK, sure, it's hot and bitter,|like a relationship that way, but - What's like a relationship?
|- Nothing I have.
Coffee.
There's no comparison between|college men and high-school boys.
- I mean, look at that.
|- So, Cor, you're datin' college guys now?
Well, not that it's any of your business,|but I happen to be dating a Delta Zeta Kappa.
Oh, an extraterrestrial.
So that's how you get|a date after you exhausted the human guys.
You'll go to college someday.
I just know your pizza-delivery career|will take you so many exciting places.
Oh!
I told Giles I'd meet him|in the library ten minutes ago.
He won't be upset.
|Not much paranormal activity lately.
Just because the paranormal is more|"normal" and less "para" of late, ..
is no excuse for tardiness|or letting your guard down.
- I haven't let my guard down.
|- Really?
You yawned your way through|weapons training.
You skipped hand-to-hand.
Are you going to be prepared if a demon|springs up behind you and does this?
Well, I'm not a demon.
Which is why you should let go now.
Thank you.
When you live on top of|a a mystical convergence, ..
it's only a matter of time|before a fresh hell breaks loose.
Now is the time you should train|more strictly, hunt and patrol more keenly.
Hone your skills day and night.
And the slice of life that still belongs to me|from 1:00 to 1:05 in the morning.
- Can I do what I want then?
|- Think I don't know what it's like to be 16?
No.
I think you don't know what it's like|to be 16, and a girl, and the Slayer.
Fair enough.
No, I don't.
Or what it's like to have to stake vampires|while you're having fuzzy feelings for one.
Taking on the undead doesn't|do wonders for your social life.
That's exactly where|being different comes in handy.
Who needs a social life|when you have a hellmouth?
Yes!
You have a duty, a purpose.
|You have a commitment in life.
- How many people your age can say that?
|- We talkin' foreign or domestic?
How about none?
Here's a hard fact of life:|we all have to do things we don't like.
You have hand-to-hand this afternoon|and patrol tonight, so come straight here ..
and get your homework done,|and don't dawdle with your friends.
And don't think sitting there pouting|is gonna get to me, because it won't.
It's not getting to me.
Boy, what a long day.
- And you skipped three classes.
|- Yeah.
And, of course, they flew by.
Buffy.
Aren't you supposed to be doing|your homework in the library?
I'm dawdling with my friends.
Works for me.
- You OK?
|- Jeez.
- Cordelia.
|- Hi, Richard.
Nice car.
We're having a get-together|tomorrow night at the house.
It's gonna be a really special evening.
- Excuse me?
|- Oh.
I would I would love to go.
So, who's your friend?
Her?
Oh, she's not my friend.
- She's amazing.
|- She's more like a sister.
We're that close.
Why don't you introduce us?
OK.
OK, so tonight, channel 59: Indian TV.
Sex, lies, incomprehensible story lines.
|I'll bring the nuts.
Richard and his fraternity brother|wanna meet you.
I don't wanna meet fraternity boys.
If there was a God,|don't you think he'd keep it that way?
We were dawdlin' here!
- Hi, sweetheart.
I'm Richard.
And you are?
|- So not interested.
- Oh!
She's such a little comedienne.
|- What?
She likes to play hard to get?
No, Richard.
I think|you're playing easy to resist.
Feel free to ignore him.
I do all the time.
I'm Tom Warner.
I'm a senior|at Crestwood College, and I And I just feel like a complete dolt|meeting you this way, so ..
here I stand in all my doltishness.
Right!
Like she's gonna fall for that.
- I'm Buffy Summers.
|- Nice to meet you.
- Are you a senior here?
|- Junior.
Oh, me too.
Except that|I'm a senior and I'm in college.
So we have that in common.
|And I major in history.
Mm, history stumps me.
I've a hard enough|time remembering what happened last week.
Nothin' happened last week -|don't worry.
I was there.
She's gonna walk away.
Now.
So, uh My friend invited your friend|to a party we're having this weekend.
You know, he's not even really my friend.
I only joined the fraternity because|my father and grandpa were in it before me.
It meant a lot to them.
OK, boots, start a-walkin'.
I talk too much.
They're really|dull parties full of really dull people.
So would you like to come|and save me from a really dull fate?
Oh, I wish I could, but - ..
I'm sort of involved.
|- Oh, sure, of course you are.
Well, thanks for letting me ramble.
You know, people underestimate|the value of a good ramble.
Buffy!
Oh, I gotta go.
- It was nice to meet you.
|- Oh.
Same here.
I hate these guys.
Whatever|they want just falls into their laps.
- Don't you hate these guys?
|- Yeah.
With their charmed lives and movie-star good|looks and more money than you can count I'm hating.
I'm going to attack you.
Word of warning for your own good:|I won't be pulling any punches.
Please don't.
Good.
So, um, you're on patrol.
And, uh, I'll see you in the morning.
There's blood on it.
Hi.
It's nice to Blood?
I can smell it.
- It's pretty thin.
Probably belonged to a girl.
|- Probably.
I-I was just thinking, ..
wouldn't it be funny some time to see|each other when it wasn't a blood thing?
Not funny ha-ha.
- What're you saying?
You want a date?
|- No.
- You don't want a date?
|- Who said date?
I-I-I never said date.
- Right.
You just wanna have coffee.
|- Coffee?
- I knew this was gonna happen.
|- What?
What do you think is happening?
You're 16 years old.
I'm 241.
- I've done the math.
|- You don't know what you want.
Oh, no, I think I do.
|I want out of this conversation.
Listen.
If we date, you and I both know|one thing's gonna lead to another.
One thing already has led to another.
|It's a little late to read me a warning label.
I'm trying to protect you.
|This could get out of control.
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
This isn't some fairy tale.
When I kiss you, you don't wake up|from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.
No.
When you kiss me, I wanna die.
Buffy!
Did you lose weight?
And your hair All right, I respect you too|much to be dishonest.
The hair's a little Well, that really isn't the point here.
The Zeta Kappas need|a certain balance at their party.
Richard explained it to me, but I was so busy|"really listening" that I didn't hear much.
Anyway, the deal is they need you to go.
|And if you don't go, I can't.
I'm talking about Richard Anderson, as in|Anderson Farms, Anderson Aeronautics ..
and Anderson Cosmetics.
Well, you see why I have to go?
Buffy, these men are rich,|and I am not being shallow.
Think of the poor people|I could help with all my money.
- I'll go.
|- You'll go?
Great!
I'll drive.
Buffy, it's like|we're sisters with really different hair.
- I pledge my life and my death.
|- I pledge my life and my death.
To the Delta Zeta Kappas|and to Machida whom we serve.
To the Delta Zeta Kappas|and to Machida whom we serve.
On my oath, before my assembled brethren.
On my oath, before my assembled brethren.
I promise to keep our secret|from this day until my death.
I promise to keep our secret|from this day until my death.
In blood I was baptised,|in blood I shall reign, in his name.
In blood I was baptised,|and in blood I shall reign, ..
in his name.
You're now one of us.
- In his name!
|- In his name!
- Brewski time!
|- Party!
What's a girl like you|doing in a place like this?
- Please, let me go.
|- Let you go?
OK, let me think.
Mm, no!
God, I love high-school girls.
You're going to the fraternity party?
|What made you change your mind?
- Angel.
|- He's going with you?
- She has a date with Angel!
Isn't it exciting?
|- I'm elated.
I'm not going with Angel.
I'm going with - Ye gods!
Cordelia.
|- Cordelia?
Did I sound a little jealous just then?
|Cos I'm not really - Cordelia?
|- Cordelia's much better for you than Angel.
- What happened with Angel?
|- Nothing.
As usual.
- A whole lot of nothing with Angel.
|- Bummer.
I don't understand.
|I mean, he likes you.
More than likes.
- Angel barely says two words to me.
|- Don't you hate that?
- When he does, he treats me like I'm a child.
|- That bastard!
- At least Tom can cary on a conversation.
|- Yeah!
- Tom?
Who's Tom?
|- The frat guy.
Oh, Buffy, I don't think so.
Frying pan, fire?
|You know what I'm sayin'.
Will you be ready if a vampire's behind you?
Didn't see you three creeping about.
Um, how did it go last night?
I found this.
- E-N-T.
|- I've seen something like that before.
It's broken in two.
I don't know|what the rest might have spelled.
- And there's blood on it.
|- Oh.
I didn't see any.
- Angel showed up.
He could smell it.
|- The blood?
There's a guy you wanna party with.
- Blood.
|- In Sunnydale.
What a surprise.
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
|She should make the rounds again.
- We'll see who the bracelet belongs to.
|- Good idea.
She'll patrol, we'll reconvene Uh, hello?
"She" is standing right here!
- And she's not available.
|- Why not?
- This is more important|- I have homework to do.
And my mom's not really feeling well|and she could probably use my help.
And, to be truthful,|I'm not feeling all that well myself.
Sorry.
Of course, if-if you're not well I'll take an early pass this evening|and one later, but for most of the evening You should stay home with your mother.
- Well, say it.
|- I'm not gonna say it.
- You lied to Giles.
|- Cos she will.
Look, I wasn't lying.
|I was just protecting him from information - ..
that he wouldn't be able to digest properly.
|- Like a corn dog.
Like you don't have a sick mother,|but you'd rather go to a party ..
where there's gonna be drinking|and older guys and probably an orgy.
Whoa!
Since when do they have orgies?
|Why aren't I on the mailing list?
- There's no orgies.
|- I heard wild things go on at frat parties.
OK, look, seven days a week|I'm busy saving the world.
Once in a great while I wanna have some fun.
And that's what I'm gonna have.
Fun!
This isn't about fun.
This is about duty.
Your duty to help me achieve|permanent prosperity, OK?
Dos and don'ts: don't wear black, silk,|chiffon or spandex.
These are my trademarks.
Don't do that weird thing with your hair.
- What weird th|- Don't interrupt.
Do be interested if someone speaks to you.
|It may or may not happen.
But do be polite|and laugh at the appropriate intervals.
Do lie to your mom about where we're going.
|There will be drinking.
Cor, you printing up business cards with|your number, or just goin' with a halter top?
Oh, are we feeling a little envious?
You could belong to a fraternity of rich|and powerful men in the Bizarro World.
- D'you guys wanna join us?
|- Nah.
I gotta digest an' all.
Make-up, make-up.
Well, give it|your all and keep to the shadows.
We're gonna have a blast!
I can't believe she lied to Giles.
|My world is all askew.
Buffy's lying?
Buffy's going to frat parties?
That's not askew, that's cockeyed.
Askew means cockeyed.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.
|We'll help Giles.
- I'm goin' to the party.
|- What?
I've got to keep an eye on Buffy.
|Those frat guys creep me.
You wanna protect her?
And prove you're as good as the rich guys?
- And maybe catch an orgy?
|- If it's on early.
Why do they park|so darn close to you?
- Are you ready for this?
|- I don't know.
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.
Me, too.
Let's go.
Come on.
- Beaucoup babes!
|- Ooh, yeah!
You know what's so cool|about college?
The diversity.
You've got all the rich people|and all of the other people.
- Richard!
|- Welcome, ladies.
Thank you.
- Oh.
Is there alcohol in this?
|- Just a smidge.
Come on, Buffy.
It's just a smidge.
- I'll just|- I understand.
At your age,|I wasn't into grown-up things either.
Seen our multimedia room?
The one with the cherry-walnut panelling|and the two 48-inch televisions?
- No.
Wanna show me?
|- What about?
Oh, her?
She's happiest by herself.
# She walks into the room # All the guys' eyes are upon her - Cheers.
|- # I think she's got her hungry eyes on you # Yeah, you # She said she runs with the wolves # She thinks she runs with the wolves # Bend, and I'll break you # Leave, and I'll take you back again New girl!
- Easy, man.
|- Dance!
- Easy, man.
|- Come on, sweetheart.
Yeah!
- Could I have this dance?
|- Come on!
# If she bends, then she breaks - Thanks for|- No.
We're not all a bunch of drunken louts.
Some of us are sober louts!
I'm really glad that you decided to come.
And you're not.
No.
It's I shouldn't be here.
Because you're seeing someone.
No.
You're not seeing someone?
Someone's not seeing me.
So why shouldn't you be here?
Because I have obligations.
People that I'm responsible for|or to or with It's complicated.
You're big on responsibility.
I like that.
|But there's such a thing as being too mature.
You should relax|and enjoy yourself once in a while.
You think I'm too mature?
I talk too much.
|Have you picked up on that yet?
Anyway, the, uh, Hulk is gone, ..
so you don't have to dance with me.
He might come back.
# She hates you,|but then she makes a mistake # Confused and a lot to take Godzilla's attacking downtown Tokyo!
Who's this dork?
Never seen him before in my life.
We got us a crasher.
So, have either of you seen|a pair of girls here?
One's about so high?
- Hey, guys.
|- New pledge.
- New pledge.
|- New pledge!
New pledge!
New pledge!
You OK?
Yeah.
I was just thinking.
To my Argentinian junk bonds|that just matured into double digits.
To maturity.
What the hell.
I'm tired of being mature.
- Bent.
|- Sent.
Rent.
Uh, Lent.
Dent.
Went.
Kent.
- Kent!
That's it!
|- Her boyfriend's name was Kent.
No.
Kent Preparatory School.
|Just outside of town.
That's where I've seen these bracelets.
- What are you doing?
|- Pulling up their school newsletter ..
to see if there's anything about A missing girl.
Come on, dance, pretty boy!
Keep it movin'.
Come on.
Shake it!
|Don't break it!
Wrap it up and I'll take it!
OK, big fun, guys.
Who's next?
You are, dollface.
Keep on dancing!
All right!
Keep it up, yeah!
Come on, keep it goin'!
Tom?
Ooh, sorry.
OK.
Nice bed.
Just need to stop spinning for Get away from her!
- I wasn't doing anything.
|- I saw you.
- I was just having a little fun.
|- She's not here for your fun, you pervert.
She's here for the pleasure|of the one we serve.
In his name.
And that goes for the other one, too.
Callie Megan Anderson.
Missing for over a week.
No one's seen her.
|No one knows what happened to her.
This being Sunnydale and all,|I guess we can rule out something good.
- I'm calling Buffy.
|- No!
- Why not?
|- Because Buffy and her mother Are sick.
You're right.
There's no point|in disturbing them until we know more.
You mean like if there are others?
Brittany Oswald, junior at St Michael's,|disappeared a year ago.
So did Kelley Percell, sophomore at Grant.
- A year?
|- Almost to the day.
An anniversary or some other event|significant to the killer.
- Killer?
We don't know that there's a|- No, but this being Sunnydale and all Gulp.
We need to know|where Buffy found that bracelet.
- We can begin our search there.
|- Good idea.
Call Angel.
He was there when Buffy found it.
|We're gonna need all the help we can get.
- Party's over, jerkwater.
|- Wait.
A friend of mine was here.
You know, in that light, ..
with that wig on an' all, ..
you're still butt ugly!
Buffy, where are we?
In the basement, as far as I can tell.
- What's happening?
What did they do to us?
|- They drugged us.
Why?
What are they gonna do to us?
- I don't know.
|- I wanna go home.
No one's going home.
Ever.
One of them's different than the others.
Nicer.
Tom.
He's the one to watch out for.
- She's last.
|- Last?
For what?
Who's first?
Answer me!
Who's first?
Three stones.
Three of us.
Buffy Stay calm.
We'll get out of this.
Why did I ever let you|talk me into coming here?
!
She found the bracelet in the cemetery,|near the south wall.
South wall.
What are you doing?
Oh, sorry.
The reflection thing|that you don't have.
Angel, how do you shave?
South wall, that's near the college and|the fraternity house!
- A fraternity?
|- Could they be taking these girls?
Let's get out there.
Buffy We don't know that it's concrete.
|Let's not disturb her ..
is there!
With Cordelia!
|They went to a party at the Zeta Kappa House.
- She lied to me?
|- Well Did she have a date?
Well Well, why do you think she went to that|party?
Because you gave her the brushoff.
And you never let her do anything|except work and patrol.
I know she's the Chosen One,|but you're killing her with pressure.
I mean, she's 16 going on 40!
And you!
You're gonna live for ever.
|You don't have time for a cup of coffee?
OK.
I don't feel better now,|and we've gotta help Buffy.
One day I'll have money, prestige, power.
And on that day, they'll still have more.
- Machida.
|- In his name.
We who serve you, ..
we who receive all that you bestow, ..
call upon you in this holy hour.
This holy hour.
We have no wealth, - ..
no possession, except what you give us.
|- Except what you give us.
We have no power, ..
no place in the world, - ..
except what you give us.
|- Except what you give us.
- What are they, some kind of cult?
|- Yeah.
Psycho-cult.
- You've gotta do something.
|- It has been a year since our last offering.
A year in which our bounty overflowed.
We come before you with fresh offerings.
Offerings?
He's talking about us?
Do you see anyone else chained up in here?
Accept our offering, dark lord.
And bless us with your power, - ..
Machida!
|- Machida!
- What's down there?
|- Come forth, ..
and let your terrible countenance look upon|your servants and their humble offering.
We call you, Machida.
In his name, Machida!
There's something down there|and he's gonna throw us down there with it!
- I don't think so.
|- No?
Well, that's good.
That's I don't think we go to it.
I think it comes to us.
Oh, my God!
Come on, Buffy!
Oh, come on!
For he shall rise from the depths|and we shall tremble before him.
He who is the source|of all we inherit and all we possess.
- Machida.
|- Machida.
And if he is pleased with our offerings,|then our fortunes shall increase.
Machida, let our fortunes increase.
And on the tenth day of the tenth month, ..
he shall be enhungered|and we shall feed him.
Feed him?
!
Oh, no!
Looks like everyone's gone.
- Hey.
|- Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
A bunch of girls are missing.
|The Zeta Kappas may be involved.
And Buffy.
Are you wearing make-up?
No.
I think Buffy's still inside somewhere|with Cordelia.
Their car's still here.
- Why are you wearing that?
|- I found it in their trash.
I saw them wearing robes.
They went down|to the basement.
I was gonna sneak in.
- They may be involved in a ritual.
|- With the missing girls.
With Buffy!
OK, that is the guy you wanna party with.
- Hey, Reptile Boy!
|- No woman speaks to him.
You don't want her.
She's all skin and bones.
|Half an hour later you'll be hungry.
I told you to shut up!
You speak again, and I'll cut your throat.
Got locked out dumping the trash.
Let me in.
I don't wanna miss the, uh - Come on.
|- You know what.
Where are they?
Something's going on upstairs.
Go!
Go!
Feed, dark lord.
That's for the wig!
That's for the bra!
Some guy's attacking Buffy with a sword!
|Also, there's a big snake!
That's for the make-up!
|And that's for the last 16½ years!
Guys!
Buffy!
Snake!
Basement now!
You bitch!
I'll serve you to him in pieces.
Tom, you talk too much.
Help!
Help!
Let her go, Wormy!
You did it.
You saved us.
I've never been so happy|to see anyone in my whole You guys, I just ..
hate you guys.
The weirdest things|always happen when you're around.
And you!
You're goin' to jail for 15,000 years.
I told one lie.
I had one drink.
Yes.
And you were very nearly|devoured by a giant demon snake.
The words "let that be a lesson"|are a tad redundant at this juncture.
- I'm sorry.
|- So am I. I I drive you too hard|because I know what you have to face.
From now on,|no more pushing, no more prodding.
Just, um ..
an inordinate amount of nudging.
Come on, come on, hurry!
There you go.
Thank you, Jonathan.
Did we forget something?
Um ..
cinnamon, chocolate, half-caf, non-fat.
Extra foam!
Young men are the only way to go.
Says here that they've all been|sentenced to consecutive life sentences.
"Investigators found the bones of girls|in a cavern beneath the frat house, ..
and older bones dating back 50 years".
"A number of corporations whose|chairmen are former Delta Zeta Kappas ..
are suffering from|falling profits, IRS raids" Oh, "and suicides in the boardroom".
Starve a snake, lose a fortune.
|The rich really are different.
Have you heard from Angel?
When he got so mad about you being|in danger, and changed into a grrr, ..
it was the most amazing thing I ever saw.
- I mean, how many guys can|- Angel, Angel, Angel.
Does every conversation have to come|round to that freak?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Buffy.
- Angel.
|- Xander.
I hear this place, uh, serves coffee.
I thought maybe you and I|should get some sometime.
If you want.
Yeah.
Sometime.
I'll let you know.
# If she bends, then she breaks # She loves you,|but then she takes it away
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I know.
Is the Bronze|so not happening, or what?
- Oh Hi.
|- Hi.
- I'm waitin' for Buffy.
|- I'm supposed to be meeting Devon, ..
but it's like being in a band|gives him an obligation to flake.
Well, his loss is your incredible gain.
I told Devon "You call that leather interior?
|My Barbie Dream Car had nicer seats"!
Buffy?
Buffy!
- Hi.
I'm|- Late.
Rough day at the office.
So I see.
Hey.
It's a look.
A seasonal look.
Buffy, I love the hair.
|It just screams "street urchin".
Know what?
I need to go|put a bag over my head.
Don't listen to her.
You look fine.
You're sweet.
A terrible liar but sweet.
- I thought we had|- A date.
So did I. But who am I kidding?
|Dates are things normal girls have.
Girls who have time to|think about nail polish and facials.
You know what I think about?
|Ambush tactics.
Beheading.
Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.
Cappuccino?
- Hey!
|- You're volunteering.
But I have to get to class.
Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer|safety programme for Halloween.
- Note his take on the volunteer concept.
|- What's the deal?
Kids need people|to take them trick-or-treatin'.
Sign up and get your own pack|of sugar-hyped little runts.
Yikes!
I'll stick to vampires.
Miss Summers.
Just the juvenile delinquent|I've been looking for.
- Principal Snyder.
|- Halloween must be a big night for you.
Tossing eggs, keying cars,|bobbing for apples.
One pathetic cry for help after another.
Well, not this year, missy.
Gosh, I'd love to sign up, but ..
I've developed carpal tunnel syndrome|and can tragically no longer hold a flashlight.
The programme starts at four,|the children have to be back at six.
I can't believe this.
We have to|get dressed up and the whole deal?
- Snyder said costumes were mandatory.
|- Great.
I was gonna stay in and veg.
The one night a year|things are supposed to be quiet.
Halloween quiet?
I figured it would be|a big old vamp scare-a-palooza.
Not according to Giles.
He swears tomorrow|night is dead for the undead.
They stay in.
Those wacky vampires.
That's why I love 'em.
|They just keep you guessin'.
- Harris.
|- Larry.
You're lookin' Cro-Mag as usual.
- What can I do you for?
|- You and Buffy.
You're just friends, right?
I like to think of it more as|a solid foundation for future bliss.
- So she's not your girlfriend?
|- Alas, no.
D'you think she'd go out with me?
Well, Larry, that's a tough question|to No.
Not a chance.
Why not?
I heard some guy say she was fast.
- I hope you mean like the wind.
|- You know what I mean.
- That's my friend you're talkin' about.
|- Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna do what any man|would do about it.
Somethin' damn manly.
Get gone.
- Ooh!
Diet.
|- Do you know what you just did?
- Saved a dollar?
|- Larry was about to pummel me.
- Oh, that?
Forget about it.
|- Oh, I'll forget about it.
In maybe 15, 20 years, when my rep|for being a sissy man finally fades.
A black eye heals, Buffy,|but cowardice has an unlimited shelf life.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot for your help.
Ohhh!
I think I just|violated the guy code, big time.
Poor Xander.
Boys are so fragile.
- Speaking of, how was your date last night?
|- Misfire.
I was late due to unscheduled slayage.
|Showed up looking trashed.
- Was he mad?
|- Actually, he was pretty unmad.
Which was probably to do with the fact|that Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
Angel would never fall for her act.
That "showing up wearing a stunning outfit,|embracing personal hygiene" act?
You know what I mean.
She's not his type.
Are you sure?
I mean,|I don't know what his type is.
I've known him less than a year,|and he's not exactly one to overshare.
True.
It's too bad we can't sneak a look|at the Watcher Diaries and read up on Angel.
I'm sure it's full of fun facts.
Yeah It's too bad.
That stuff is private.
Also, Giles keeps them in his office.
|In his personal files.
Most importantly, it would be wrong.
- Buffy.
Excellent.
|- Nothing.
Hi!
Yes, I just wanted to|talk to you about tomorrow night.
As it should be calm, I thought we might|work on some new battle techniques.
You're beginning to scare me, Giles.
|You need to have some fun.
You know, there's this place you can go.
You sit in the dark, and there are these|moving pictures, and they tell a story.
Ha-ha.
Very droll.
I'll have you know|that I have very many relaxing hobbies.
Such as?
Well, um I enjoy cross-referencing.
Do you stuff your own shirts,|or send them out?
So, how come Halloween|is such a big yawner?
Do the demons just hate|how commercial it's become?
It's interesting Not, I suspect, to you.
|What is it you're after?
Of course it's of interest.
|I'm the Slayer.
I need to know these things.
You can't keep me in the dark any longer.
|Look at me when I talk to you!
- I don't have time for these games.
|- Miss Calendar said you were a babe.
- She said what?
|- She said that you were a ..
hunk of burning something or other.
- So, what do you think of that?
|- Um I I don't, um - A burning hunk of what?
|- You know how disgusting it is for me ..
to even contemplate grown-ups having|smoochies, but I think you should go for it.
- Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but|- But I've overstepped my bounds.
What was I thinking?
My God!
Shame.
Shame.
I gotta go.
"Babe"?
.
I can live with it.
- Man, look at her.
|- Who is she?
It doesn't say, but the entry's dated 1775.
Angel was 18.
And still human.
So that's the kind of girl he hung around?
|She's pretty coiffed.
She looks like a noblewoman or something.
Which means being beautiful|was sort of her job.
Then clearly this girl was a workaholic.
Willow, I'll never be like this.
Come on!
She's not that pretty.
I mean, look at her.
|She's got a funny uh, waist.
- Look how tiny that is.
|- Thank you.
Now I feel better.
No.
She's like a freak.
A circus freak.
Yuck!
It must have been wonderful|to put on some fantabulous gown, ..
and go to a ball like a princess, ..
and have horses|and servants and yet more gowns.
Yeah Still, I think I prefer|being able to vote.
Or I will when I can.
So, Buffy, you ran off last night|and left poor little Angel all by his lonesome.
But I did everything I could to comfort him.
- I'll bet.
|- So, what's the story, anyway?
- I mean, I never see him around.
|- Not during the day, anyway.
Oh, please!
Don't tell me|he still lives at home.
He has to wait for his dad|before he can take the car?
I think his parents have been dead|for a couple of hundred years.
Oh, good.
I mean - What?
|- Angel's a vampire.
I thought you knew.
Oh.
He's a vampire, Of course.
But the cuddly kind.
|Like a Care Bear with fangs?
- It's true.
|- You know what I think?
You're trying to scare me off|cos you're afraid of the competition.
You may be hot stuff|when it comes to demonology, ..
but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer.
- What'd you get?
|- A time-honoured classic.
- Can I give you a little friendly advice?
|- It's not spooky enough?
It's just You're never|gonna get noticed if you keep hiding.
- You're missing the point of Halloween.
|- Free candy?
It's "come as you aren't" night.
The perfect chance to get sexy and wild|with no repercussions.
Oh, I don't get wild.
|Wild on me equals "spaz".
Don't underestimate yourself.
|You got it in you.
Hey, Xander.
What'd you get?
That's not a costume.
I got fatigues from an army surplus at home.
|Call me the $2 costume king, baby.
Hey, look, Xander.
|I'm really sorry about this morning.
Do you mind, Buffy?
I'm tryin' to repress.
OK.
Then I promise from now on|I'll let you get pummelled.
Thank you.
OK.
You know,|actually, I think I could have Hello.
That was our touching|reconciliation moment there.
I'm sorry.
It's just Look at this.
- It's amazing.
|- Too bulky.
I prefer my women in spandex.
Please.
Let me.
- Oh.
It's|- Magnificent.
Yes, I know.
There.
My!
Meet the hidden princess.
I think we've found a match, don't you?
Oh, uh I'm sorry.
|There's no way I could ever afford this.
Oh, nonsense.
I feel quite moved|to make you a deal you can't refuse.
Here it comes.
Rewind that.
Let's see that again.
She's tricky.
Baby likes to play.
You see that, where she stakes him with|that thing?
That's what you call resourceful.
Rewind it again.
Miss Edith needs her tea.
Come here, poodle.
Do you love my insides?
|The parts you can't see?
Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet.
That's why I've got to study this slayer.
|Once I know her, I can kill her.
And once I kill her, you can have|your run of Sunnyhell and get strong again.
Don't worry.
Everything's switching.
Outside to inside.
It makes her weak.
Really?
Did my pet have a vision?
Do you know what I miss?
- Leeches.
|- Come on.
Talk to Daddy.
This thing that makes the Slayer weak.
- When is it?
|- Tomorrow.
Halloween?
Nothing happens on Halloween.
Someone's come to change it all.
Someone new.
The world that denies thee, thou inhabit.
The peace that ignores thee, thou corrupt.
Chaos, I remain, as ever, ..
thy faithful, degenerate son!
- Where are you meeting Angel?
|- Here, after trick-or-treating.
Mom is out.
- Does he know about your costume?
|- Nope.
Call it a blast from his past.
I'll show him I can coiffe|with the best of 'em.
OK, Willow.
Come out.
|You can't hide in there all night.
- OK.
But promise you won't laugh?
|- I promise.
Wow.
You're a dish.
I mean, really.
- But this just isn't me.
|- And that's the point.
Look, Halloween is the night that|not you is you, but not you, You know?
Oh!
That's Xander.
- Are you ready?
|- Yeah OK.
Cool.
I can't wait for the boys|to go non-verbal when they see you.
Private Harris reporting for Buffy!
Lady of Buffdom,|Duchess of Buffonia, I am in awe.
I completely renounce spandex.
Thank you, kind sir.
But wait till you see - Hi.
|- ..
Casper.
Hey, Will!
That's a fine "Boo"!
you got there.
Go ahead.
We'll meet you inside.
This is your group, Summers.
No need to speak to them.
|The last thing they need is your influence.
Just bring them back in one piece|and I won't expel you.
Hi.
Where's your bodyguard, Harris?
|Curling her hair?
Oz!
Oz.
Hey, Cordelia.
- Jeez, you're like a big cat.
|- That's my costume.
- Are you playing tonight?
|- Yeah.
The Shelter Club.
Is Mr "I'm so great I don't have to show up|for my date or even call" gonna be there?
- Yeah.
He's just goin' by "Devon" now.
|- Well, tell him that I don't care, ..
and that I didn't even mention it, and that|I didn't even see you, so that's just fine.
- So what do I tell him?
|- Nothing.
Jeez!
Get with the programme.
Why can't I meet a nice girl like that?
- Oh!
I'm sorry.
|- Sorry.
- Sorry.
|- Sorry.
OK.
On sleazing extra candy.
Tears are key.
Tears will normally|get you the double-bagger.
You can try the old "You missed me"|routine, but it's risky.
Only go there for chocolate.
Understood?
OK, troops.
Let's move out.
What did Mrs Davis give you?
She must be stopped.
Let's hit one more house.
We still have|a few minutes before I need to get you back.
Janus, evoco vester animum, Exaudi meam causam, Carpe noctem pro consilium vestrem, Vene, appare, et nobis monstra|quod est infinita potestas, Come on, guys.
Trick or treat.
Oh, my goodness!
Aren't you adorable!
Persona intra corpem et sanguem|commutandum est, Vestra sancta praesentia|concrescit visceram!
Janus!
Sume noctem!
Oh, dear!
Am I all out?
Showtime!
I could have sworn I had more candy.
I'm sorry, Mr Monster.
Maybe I No!
Let her go!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop!
Hey!
Oh, my God!
I can't breathe.
Oh, my God!
I'm a real ghost!
Xander?
Xander!
It's me - Willow.
- I don't know any Willow.
|- Xander, this is no time for jokes.
- What the hell's goin' on here?
|- You don't know me?
- Lady, I suggest you find cover.
|- No, wait!
- What are you?
|- Xander, listen to me.
I'm on your side, I swear.
|Something crazy is happening.
I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween,|and now I am a ghost.
And you were supposed to be a soldier, - ..
and now I guess you're a real soldier.
|- You expect me to believe that?
No!
No guns!
That's still a little kid!
- Step out of the way!
|- No guns!
That's an order.
We just need to find Buffy!
Buffy!
Are you OK?
- This could be a situation.
|- Buffy, what do we do?
Buffy, are you all right?
- What?
|- Are you hurt?
- Buffy, are you hurt?
|- Buffy?
- She's not Buffy.
|- Who's Buffy?
Oh, this is fun.
What year is this?
I-I don't understand.
Who are you?
- We're friends.
|- Friends of whom?
Y-Your dress Everything is strange.
|How did I come to be here?
Breathe, OK?
Breathe.
|You're gonna faint again.
How do we get through this|without the Slayer?
What's a Slayer?
- Get inside before we come across|- A demon!
A demon!
A demon!
- It's not a demon.
It's a car.
|- What does it want?
- Is this woman insane?
|- She's never seen a car.
- She's never seen a car?
|- She's from the past.
- And you're a ghost?
|- Yes.
Now let's get inside.
I just want you to know|that I'm takin' a lot on faith here.
- Where do we go?
|- Where's the closest We can go to a friend's.
- All clear.
|- Hello?
Mrs Summers?
Good.
She's gone.
- Where are we?
|- Your place.
Now we just need to Don't open it!
- It could be a civilian.
|- Or a mini-demon!
This This could be me.
It is you.
Buffy, can't you remember at all?
No!
I I don't understand any of this.
This is some other girl.
I would|never wear that low apparel, and ..
I don't like this place, I don't like you,|and I just want to go home!
You are home.
She couldn't have dressed up like Xena?
- Not a civilian!
|- Affirmative!
Hey!
What did we say?
- Big noise scare monster, remember?
|- Got it.
Dammit!
Surely he'll not desert us?
Whatever.
No!
Somebody help me!
- Xander!
Help me!
|- Come inside.
- Cordelia!
|- Willow, what's going on?
Your name is Cordelia, you're not a cat,|and we're your friends.
Well, sort of.
That's nice, Willow.
|And you went mental when?
- You know us?
|- Yeah.
Lucky me.
- What's with the name game?
|- A lot's going on.
No kidding!
I was attacked|by Jo-Jo the Dog-faced Boy.
Look at my costume!
Do you think|they'll give me my deposit back?
- Not on the likely.
|- Here.
- Thanks.
|- OK.
You guys stay here while I get help.
If something tries to get in, just fight it off.
It's not our place to fight.
|Surely some men will protect us?
- What's that riff?
|- It's like amnesia, OK?
They don't know who they are.
|Just sit tight.
Who died and made her the boss?
Well This is just neat.
You!
Check upstairs.
|Make sure everything's locked up.
Surely there's somewhere we can go?
|A safe haven?
The lady said to stay put.
You would take orders from a woman?
|Are you feeble in some way?
Ma'am, in the army we have a saying:|"Sit down and shut the" She must be right.
|We must have some kind of amnesia.
I don't know what that is, but I'm sure|I don't have it.
I bathe quite often.
How do you explain this?
I don't!
I was brought up a proper lady.
|I wasn't meant to understand things.
I'm just meant to look pretty.
|Then someone nice will marry me.
- Possibly a baron.
|- This ain't no tea party, princess.
- Sooner or later, you're gonna have to fight.
|- Fight these low creatures?
I'd sooner die.
- Then you'll die.
|- Oh, good.
You guys are all right.
- It's total chaos out there.
|- Who are you?
Hi.
- OK.
Somebody wanna fill me in?
|- Do you live here?
No.
You know that.
Buffy I'm lost here.
You What's up with your hair?
They don't know who they are.
Everyone's|turned into a monster.
How are you?
Do you mind?
You take the princess and secure the kitchen.
|Catwoman, you're with me.
I don't want to go with you.
I like the man|with the musket.
Do you have a musket?
I didn't leave that open.
- Stake!
|- A what?
Get me a stake!
Hurry up!
Buffy, no!
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
|Plus I can't turn the page.
All right, let's let's review.
So everybody became whatever|they were masquerading as.
Right.
Xander was a soldier,|and Buffy was an 18th-century girl.
- And your your costume?
|- I'm a ghost.
Yes.
But, um The ghost of what, exactly?
Well, this is nothing.
|You should see what Cordelia was wearing.
A unitard with cat things, like ears and stuff.
Good heavens.
|Sh-she became an actual feline?
No.
She was the same old Cordelia.
Just in a cat costume.
She didn't change?
No.
Hold on.
Party Town.
She told us|she got her outfit from Party Town.
And everybody who changed,|they acquired their costumes where?
We all got ours at a new place.
Ethan's.
- Sure she came this way?
|- She'll be OK.
Buffy would be OK.
Whoever she is now,|she's helpless.
Come on!
Do you hear that, my friends?
Somewhere out here is|the tenderest meat you've ever tasted.
And all we have to do is find her first.
Pretty, pretty!
Hello?
Anyone home?
Giles?
Janus.
A Roman mythical god.
What does this mean?
Primarily, the division of self.
Male and female light and dark.
Chunky and creamy.
Oh, no.
|Sorry.
That's peanut butter.
- Willow, get out of here now.
|- But Now!
Hello, Ethan.
Hello, Ripper.
Buffy, are you OK?
What's your deal?
Take a pill!
He's He's a vampire.
She's got this thing where|she thinks Oh, forget it.
It's OK.
Angel is a good vampire.
|He would never hurt you.
- Really?
|- Absolutely.
He's our friend.
It's strange, but beating up that pirate|gave me a weird sense of closure.
- Willow!
|- Guys, you gotta get inside.
- We need a triage.
|- This way.
Find an open warehouse.
Ladies, we're on the move.
What, no hug?
Aren't you pleased|to see your old mate, Rupert?
I'm just surprised I didn't guess it was you.
This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Don't wish to blow my own trumpet,|but it's genius.
The very embodiment of|"Be careful what you wish for".
It's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent.
And we all know you are|the champion of innocence ..
and all things pure and good, Rupert.
It's quite a little act you've got here.
It's no act.
It's who I am.
Who you are?
The Watcher?
Snivelling, tweed-clad guardian|of the Slayer and her kin?
I think not.
I know who you are, Rupert,|and I know what you're capable of.
But they don't, do they?
They have no idea where you come from.
Break the spell, Ethan.
|Then leave this place and never come back.
Why should I?
What's in the bargain for me?
- You get to live.
|- Oh, Rupert, you're scaring me.
Over here.
Check if there any other ways in!
Just stay here.
Oh, faboo.
More clinging.
Go!
- And you said the Ripper was long gone.
|- Tell me how to stop the spell.
Say "pretty please".
Look at you.
You're shaking.
Terrified.
Alone.
Lost little lamb.
- I love it.
|- Buffy!
Tell me how to stop the spell.
Janus Break its statue.
Now that guy you can shoot.
- What the|- I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
You know what?
It's good to be me.
- Hey, Buff.
Welcome back.
|- Yeah - You too.
|- You guys remember what happened?
It was way creepy.
It was like|I was there, but I couldn't get out.
I know the feeling.
|This outfit's skintight.
You OK?
Yeah.
Hello.
It felt like I was talking.
|My lips were moving, and Give it up, Cordy.
You're never gonna|get between those two.
Believe me, I know.
Well, I guess you'd better|get them back to their parents.
Yeah.
Everybody seems to Where's Willow?
# You got the best of me # It didn't take so long # The things you put me through Who is that girl?
# Ta-dah!
Just little old 20th-century me.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'll live.
I don't get it, Buffy.
Why'd you think|I'd like you better dressed that way?
I just I wanted to be a real girl for once.
The kind of fancy girl|you liked when you were my age.
- What?
|- I hated the girls back then.
Especially the noblewomen.
- You did?
|- They were just incredibly dull.
Simpering morons, the lot of them.
I always wished|I could meet someone exciting.
- Interesting.
|- Really?
- Interesting how?
|- You know how.
Still, I had a really hard day,|and you should probably tell me.
You're right.
I should.
Definitely.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Come on, Mom!
She's always late.
Are you lost?
No.
My mom's just supposed to pick me up, is all.
Do you want me to walk you home?
No, thank you.
My mummy used to sing me to sleep at night.
# Run and catch # The lamb is caught|in the blackberry patch She had the sweetest voice.
What will your mummy sing|when they find your body?
I'm not supposed to talk to people.
Oh.
Well, I'm not a person, see?
|So that's just Run home.
My Angel!
Hello, Drusilla.
Do you remember the song|Mummy used to sing me?
- Pretty.
|- I remember.
- Yes, you do.
|- Drusilla, leave here.
I'm offering you that chance.
|Take Spike and get out.
Or you'll hurt me?
No.
No, you can't.
Not any more.
If you don't leave, it'll go badly for all of us.
My dear boy's gone all away, hasn't he?
To her.
Who?
The girl.
The Slayer.
Your heart stinks of her.
Poor little thing.
|She has no idea what's in store.
This can't go on, Drusilla.
It's gotta end.
Oh, no, my pet.
This is just the beginning.
- It's a secret.
|- What kind of a secret?
The kind where I don't|actually tell you what it is.
It's customary that when two people go out,|they both know where they're going.
Come on!
Where is your sense of adventure?
How will I know what to wear?
Do you own anything else?
- Er, well, not as such, no.
|- Rupert, you're gonna have to trust me.
- All right.
I'll put myself in your hands.
|- That sounds like fun.
- OK, tomorrow night.
1:30, right?
|- Yes.
Hey.
- Hello.
Did we hunt last night?
|- I did a couple of quick sweeps downtown.
- Any encounters?
|- Nothing vampirey.
I've been researching your friend Spike.
|The profile is fairly unappetising.
I still haven't got a bead on why he's here.
- You'll figure it out.
|- You all right?
You seem a little glum.
- I'm fine.
|- Why don't you take the night off?
- OK.
That'd be nice.
|- You could spend some time with Angel.
I don't know.
He might have other plans.
- Louis XVI was just a weak king.
|- Any other impressions?
I don't see why everyone picks on|Marie Antoinette.
I can so relate to her.
She worked hard to look that good|and people don't appreciate the effort.
And I know the peasants were all depressed.
I think you mean "oppressed".
Whatever.
They were cranky.
So they're|like "Let's lose some heads"!
That's fair.
And Marie Antoinette cared about them.
|She was gonna let them have cake.
A very interesting perspective.
|Would anyone else like to comment?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
|They seemed pretty friendly.
- Who's friendly?
|- No one.
- Angel and a girl.
|- Do we have to be in total share mode?
Hey, if Angel's doing|something wrong, I wanna know.
- Cos it gives me a happy.
|- I'm glad someone has a happy.
Oh, you just need cheering up.
|And I know just the thing.
- Crazed dance party at the Bronze!
|- I don't know.
Very calm dance party at the Bronze?
Moping at the Bronze?
I'd suggest a box of Oreos dunked in|apple juice, but maybe she's over that.
- Ford?
|- Hey, Summers.
How you been?
- Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?
|- Matriculating.
- Huh?
|- I'm finishing my senior year at Sunnydale.
- Dad got transferred.
|- This is great!
Do you think so?
|I didn't think you'd remember me.
Remember you?
Duh!
We only went|to school together for seven years!
- You were my fifth-grade crush.
|- So!
You two know each other?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, this is Ford.
Billy Fordham, this is Xander and Willow.
- Hi.
|- Nice to meet you.
Uh, Ford and I went to|Hemey together in LA.
- And now you're here.
|- Dad got the transfer and boom!
He dragged me out|of Hemey and put me here.
- So you two were sweeties in fifth grade?
|- Not even!
- Ford wouldn't give me the time of day.
|- I was a manly sixth-grader.
- Couldn't be bothered with a girl that young.
|- It was terrible.
I moped over you for months.
Sitting in my room listening to|that Divinyls song "I Touch Myself'.
Of course, I had no idea what it was about!
Hey, are you busy tonight?
|We're going to the Bronze.
It's the local club and you have to come.
I'd love to, but if you guys already|had plans, would I be imposing?
- Oh, only in the literal sense.
|- OK, then!
I gotta find the admissions office.
I'll take you there and|I'll see you guys in French.
It's good to meet you.
This is Ford,|my bestest friend of all my friends!
Jeez, doesn't she know any fat guys?
Oh, that's what that song is about?
!
- Ford, you made it.
|- It wasn't hard to find.
Ford was just telling us about the ninth grade|beauty contest and the swimsuit competition.
Oh, my God, Ford, stop!
The more people|you tell, the more people I have to kill.
You can't touch me.
|I know all your darkest secrets.
- Care to make a small wager on that?
|- I'm gonna get a drink.
Ford try not to talk.
- Oh.
|- Hey.
I was hoping you'd show.
- That's Angel.
|- He's Buffy's beau.
Her special friend.
He's not in school, right?
|He looks older than her.
You're not wrong.
So, - ..
what did you do last night?
|- Nothin'.
Nothing at all?
You ceased to exist?
No, I mean I stayed in, read.
Oh.
- Didn't want that soda after all?
|- Not thirsty.
- Hey, Angel.
|- Hi.
- This is Ford.
We went to school in LA.
|- Nice to meet you.
- Whoa!
Cold hands.
|- You're not wrong.
- So, you're here visiting Buffy?
|- No, I'm actually here to stay.
- We've just moved down.
|- Hey, Angel, do you wanna play?
You know, it's getting really crowded|in here tonight.
I'm a little hot.
- You wanna take a walk?
|- Um, sure.
That'd be nice.
OK, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.
|- Take care.
- OK, once more, with tension.
|- He just moved here?
Yeah, and boy, does he move fast!
Well, Angel, we could still play.
See?
You made him do|that thing where he's gone!
So that was your boyfriend?
No Uh, yeah.
Maybe.
- Can we lay off the tough questions?
|- Sorry.
What else do you do for fun around here?
Um My purse!
I left my purse at|the Bronze.
Could you get it for me?
- Uh , OK.
|- Good.
Run!
Thanks.
No!
- What's goin' on?
|- Um There was a cat.
A cat, here.
And, um, then there was another cat.
And they fought.
The cats.
And then they left.
Oh.
I thought you were|just slaying a vampire.
What?
Whatting a what?
I know, Buffy.
You don't have to lie.
I've been trying to figure out|the right time to tell you.
I know you're the Slayer.
- Just like that, he told you?
|- Just like that, He found out before|I got booted from Hemey.
Wow!
It's neat!
- Is it neat?
|- Yeah, I guess it is.
I don't have to constantly worry|he's going to find out my dark secret.
And it just makes everything easier.
- Ford?
Hi, Ford.
|- Hey.
- Well, how did it go?
|- It went good.
Good?
That's it?
That's all?
- Well, when are we?
|- Soon.
Soon.
You could give me more information.
|I'm trusting you.
I'm out on a limb.
The lease is almost up.
|Who's gonna cover it?
- Marvin|- Diego!
Come on, it's Diego now.
Diego.
Ritalin.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just make sure you're ready when I say.
|True believers only.
- I can't wait.
|- I still think I should be in on the plan.
Diego, you gotta trust me.
All right, A couple of days, and we'll do the two things|every teen should have the chance to do.
Die young ..
and stay pretty.
So ..
you play your wits against mine, Me, who commanded armies|hundreds of years before you were born, Fools!
- Oh!
Angel, what are you doing here?
|- I wanted to talk to you.
Oh, well - Well?
|- I can't.
Unless you invite me, I can't come in.
Oh!
Well, OK I invite you to come in.
- If this is a bad time, I|- No!
I just I'm not supposed to have boys in my room.
I promise to behave myself.
OK.
Good.
- I guess I need help.
|- Help?
You mean, like, on homework?
No, cos you're old|and you already know stuff.
I want you to track someone down|on the Net.
Oh!
Great!
I'm so the Net girl.
I just wanna find everything I can: records,|affiliates I'm not even sure what I want.
- Great, what's the name?
|- Billy Fordham.
Uh, Angel, if I say something|you really don't wanna hear, ..
do you promise not to bite me?
- Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
|- Well, you do sometimes get that way.
You know, I never used to.
Things used to be pretty simple.
A hundred years|just hanging out, feeling guilty, ..
really honed my brooding skills.
Then she comes along.
Yeah, I get jealous.
But I know people,|and my gut tells me this is a wrong guy.
OK, but if there isn't anything weird - Hey, that's weird.
|- What?
I just checked the school records|and he's not in them.
I mean, usually they transfer your grades,|but he's not even registered.
- You said he was in school with you.
|- Let me see if I can - Willow, are you still up?
|- Go!
Uh, I'm just going to bed now, Mom!
Come by tomorrow at sunset.
|I'll keep looking.
- Don't tell Buffy what we're doing.
|- You want me to lie to her?
Just don't bring it up|till we know what's what.
- OK.
It's probably nothing.
|- That'd be nice.
Willow!
- What's up?
|- Nothing.
- You wanna hang?
We're cafeteria bound.
|- I-I'm gonna do work in the computer lab ..
on schoolwork that I have.
- So I cannot hang just now.
Hi, Ford.
|- Morning.
- OK, Will, fess up.
|- What?
Are you drinking coffee again?
|Cos we've talked about this.
It makes me jumpy.
I have to go away.
- Nice girl.
|- There aren't two of those!
Buffy!
Erm Yes, er Miss Calendar and I are going|somewhere tonight.
She's given me the number of her|beeper thingy, er, in case you need me ..
for, erm, study help suddenly.
- He knows, Giles.
|- What?
- Ford knows I'm the Slayer.
|- I know.
Oh.
Er, very good, yes.
Buffy?
Excuse me.
You're not by any chance|betraying your secret identity ..
just to impress cute boys, are you?
I didn't tell him.
He knew.
Oh.
Er, right then.
Just remember, if you Go!
Experience this thing called fun.
|I'll try not to have a crisis.
And on your right,|once again, the beautiful campus.
You've now seen everything in Sunnydale.
Well, it's really - Feel free to say "dull".
|- OK.
Dull is good.
Or maybe not so dull.
Is that more vampires?
It must be the weather.
Stay close to me.
- Maybe they were just passing through.
|- I don't think so.
You got one chance to live.
|Tell me what I wanna know and I'll let you go.
- Where's the other one?
|- I killed her.
I killed her and she just|turned to dust.
It was amazing.
The only thing I could find was this address.
|The Sunset Club.
Still nothing incriminating.
No paper trail or records.
|That's incriminating.
- Yeah, I'm with Dead Boy on this one.
|- Could you not call me that?
We're friends of Ford's.
- Boy, we blend right in.
|- No way do we stick out like sore thumbs.
Let's look around.
|You guys check out downstairs.
Sure thing, Bossy the Cow!
- OK, but do they really stick out?
|- What?
Sore thumbs.
Do they stick out?
|Have you ever seen a thumb - ..
and gone "Wow!
That baby is sore"?
|- You have too many thoughts.
Hi.
Are you noticing a theme here?
As in "vampires, yay"?
.
That's the one.
- You guys are newbies, I can tell.
|- Oh, no.
We come here all the time.
Don't be ashamed.
|It's cool that you're open to it.
We welcome anyone|interested in the lonely ones.
- The lonely ones?
|- Vampires.
Oh, we usually call them|the nasty, pointy, bitey ones.
Many people have that misconception.
But they who walk with the night|are not interested in harming anyone.
They are creatures above us, exalted.
You're a fool.
You don't have to be|so confrontational about it.
Other viewpoints than yours|may be valid, you know.
Nice meeting you.
- You really are a people person.
|- Now nobody will talk to us!
I've seen enough.
I've seen this type before.
They're children with|stories of friendly vampires - ..
to comfort themselves in the dark.
|- Is that so bad?
These people know nothing|about vampires!
What they are, ..
how they live, how they dress.
I love a good diatribe, but I'm still curious|why Ford, bestest friend of the Slayer, - ..
is hangin' with vampire wannabes.
|- Something's up with him.
You're right.
Sorry to beep you in the middle of stuff, - ..
but it seemed really weird.
|- No, you did the right thing.
Absolutely.
- You hated it that much?
|- No, but ..
vampires on campus|could have implications.
Very grave.
- You could have just said something.
|- No, honestly, I've ..
I've always been interested|in in monster trucks.
- Monster trucks?
|- I thought it would be a change.
- It was a change.
|- We could have just left.
And miss the nitro-burning funny cars?
|Couldn't have that.
OK, can we get back on the vampire tip here?
|They were here with a purpose.
Yes, and we must ascertain|what that purpose is.
- Where's your friend?
|- I sent him home.
Good.
The less he's involved|in all this, the safer he'll be.
He did bag a vamp his first time out.
Gotta give him credit for that.
Something wrong?
- Who's this?
|- Erm, she's called Drusilla.
A sometime paramour of Spike's.
|She was killed by an angry mob in Prague.
Well, they don't make angry mobs|like they used to, cos this girl's alive.
- I saw her with Angel.
|- With Angel?
Isn't he supposed to be a good guy?
- Yeah.
He is.
|- I think we need to read up on this nice lady.
Well, some of my newer volumes may be|more helpful.
My own research has - Are you guys OK?
|- A book!
It took one of my books.
At least someone in this school is reading.
He said he killed it.
That's the vampire Ford said he killed.
You sing the sweetest little song|Won't you sing for me, hm?
Don't you love me any more?
Darling.
I heard a funny thing just now.
Lucius tells me that you|went out on a hunt the other night.
My tummy was growly and you were out.
Come on.
- I'll pout if you don't sing.
|- You, um, meet anyone?
Anyone interesting?
Like Angel?
- Angel|- Yeah.
So What might you guys|have talked about, then?
Old times?
Childhood pranks?
It's a little off, you two so friendly,|him being the enemy and all that.
- I'll give you a seed if you sing.
|- The bird's dead, Dru.
You left it in a cage and you didn't feed it|and now it's dead, just like the last one.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Look, I'm a bad, rude man.
I just don't like you goin' out,|that's all.
You are weak.
Would you like a new bird?
|One that's not dead?
This is so cool!
- I would totally live here!
|- Do I have anyone on watch here?
It's called security, people!
|Are you all asleep?
Or did we finally find|a restaurant that delivers?
- I know who you are.
|- Yeah, I know who I am too.
So what?
I came looking for you Spike.
You've got a real death wish.
It's almost interesting.
Oh, this is great!
This'll be very useful.
- So, how did you find me?
|- That doesn't matter.
I've got something to offer you.
Is this the part where you take out a watch ..
and say I've got 30 seconds to|convince you not to kill me?
It's traditional.
Well, I don't go much for tradition.
Wait, love.
Well?
Oh, come on.
Say it!
|It's no fun if you don't say it.
What?
!
Oh You've got 30 seconds|to convince me not to kill you.
Yes!
See, this is the best.
I wanna be like you.
A vampire.
I've known you for two minutes|and I can't stand you.
I don't feature you livin' for ever.
|Can I eat him now, love?
Well, feature this.
I'm offering you a trade.
You make me a vampire ..
and I give you the Slayer.
Buffy.
May I come in?
Sure.
I thought once you'd been invited,|you could always just walk in.
I can.
I was just being polite.
- We need to talk.
|- Do we?
- It's about Ford.
He's not what he seems.
|- Who is these days?
- Willow looked on the computer.
|- Willow?
- We found this address, went with Xander|- And Xander?
Wow!
Everybody's in.
|It's like a great big, exciting conspiracy.
- What are you talkin' about?
|- About the people I trust.
Who's Drusilla?
And don't lie to me.
I'm tired of it.
- Some lies are necessary.
|- For what?
Sometimes the truth is worse.
|Live long enough, you find that out.
I can take it.
I can take the truth.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you?
I love you.
I don't know if I trust you.
- Well, maybe you shouldn't do either.
|- Maybe I'm the one who should decide!
I did a lot of unconscionable things|when I became a vampire.
Drusilla was the worst.
She was an obsession of mine.
She was pure and sweet and chaste.
And you made her a vampire.
First I made her insane.
Killed everybody she loved.
Visited every mental torture|on her I could devise.
She eventually fled to a convent.
And on the day she took her holy orders, ..
I turned her into a demon.
Well, ..
I asked for the truth.
Ford's part of some society|that reveres vampires.
Practically worships them.
I don't know what he wants from you.
But you can't trust him.
Buffy!
- Ford.
|- I had a great time last night.
Well, an interesting time.
- I'm glad.
|- Do you wanna go out again tonight?
- Not busy.
|- I sort of had an idea.
It's, uh it's a secret.
I kinda wanna surprise you.
- I like surprises.
|- Can you meet me here?
- Sure.
|- At nine?
At nine.
It's gonna be fun.
Buffy!
Did, uh, Angel He told me everything.
When Angel came to my room,|he was just really concerned for you.
We didn't wanna say anything|in case we were wrong.
Did you find out what Ford is up to?
I will.
Angel was in your bedroom?
!
Ours is a forbidden love.
- Chanterelle, is everything ready?
|- Of course!
It's ready.
Hi.
- I took care of it.
I always take care of it.
|- Is it time?
Tonight?
- Are you nervous?
|- Yes.
No.
I'm ready for the change.
Do you really think they'll bless us?
I know they will.
- Are your friends comin'?
|- What are you talkin' about?
Came last night.
Two guys and a girl.
- One was mean.
|- Why didn't you tell me?
I have to do everything around here.
Sorry,|Mr Flawless Plan Guy.
It slipped my mind.
It's gonna be all right, isn't it?
|They're not gonna let us down?
- It's gonna be fine.
|- I need them to bless me.
- It's gonna be fine.
|- No.
It's really not.
It's kinda draughty in here.
I'm sorry, Ford.
|I just couldn't wait till tonight.
- I'm rash and impulsive.
It's a flaw.
|- We all have flaws.
I'm still a little fuzzy on exactly what yours is.
I think it has to do with|being a lying scumbag.
Everybody lies.
What do you want, Ford?
|What's this all about?
- I really don't think you'd understand.
|- I don't need to.
I just need to know.
I'm gonna be one of them.
- You wanna be a vampire?
|- I'm going to.
You know, vampires are|a little picky about who they change ov You were gonna offer them a trade!
I don't think I wanna talk any more.
Yeah, well I still feel awfully chatty.
|You were gonna give them me - tonight!
- Yes.
|- You had to know I'd figure it out.
Actually, I was counting on it.
- What's supposed to happen tonight?
|- This is so cool!
It's like it played in my head.
You know the part where you ask me what's|supposed to happen?
It's already happening.
Rigged up special.
Once it's closed|it can only be opened from the outside.
As soon as the sun sets, they'll be comin'.
- Ford, if these people are still around|- We'll be changed.
All of us.
We'll ascend to a new level of consciousness,|become like them - like the lonely ones.
This is the end, Buffy.
No one gets outta here alive.
- There's gotta be another way out of here.
|- This is a bomb shelter, Buffy.
I knew I wasn't gonna be able to overpower|you, but this is three feet of concrete.
- At least let the others go.
|- Why are you fighting this?
- It's what we want.
|- It's a chance for immortality.
This is a beautiful day.
Can't you see that?
What I see is, right after the sun goes down,|Spike and all of his friends pigging out - ..
at the all-you-can-eat moron bar.
|- I think we should gag her.
- I think you should try.
|- She's an unbeliever.
She taints us.
I am trying to save you!
You are playing in serious traffic.
|Do you understand that?
You're going to die, and the only hope|you have of surviving this ..
is to get out of this pit right now and|My God!
Could you have a dorkier outfit?
You gotta back her up, D.|You look like a big ninny.
Everybody spread out.
|Two on the door.
Top priority is the Slayer.
Everything else is fair game,|but remember to share, people.
Are you sure you're up for this?
I want a treat.
I need a treat.
And a special one you'll have.
Lucius, bring the car around.
- Hey, you never give up, do you?
|- No, I don't.
It's a good quality in a person.
|Too many people just take it, but us - Us?
We have something in common now?
|- More than you think.
OK, well, let me explain something to you.
|You're what we call "the bad guy".
I guess I am.
These people aren't gonna get changed, are|they?
The rest of them, they're just fodder.
Technically, yes.
But I'm in.
- I will become immortal.
|- I've got a newsflash for you, brain trust.
That's not how it works.
You die and|a demon sets up shop in your old house.
And it walks and it talks and it|remembers your life, but it's not you.
- It's better than nothin'.
|- And your life is nothing?
Ford, these people don't deserve to die!
Well, neither do I!
But apparently no one took that|into consideration, cos I'm still dyin'.
I look good, don't I?
Well, let me tell you somethin'.
|I got maybe six months left, ..
and by then, what they buy|won't even look like me.
I'm gonna be bald and|shrivelled and I'll smell bad.
Now I'm not goin' out that way.
I'm sorry, Summers.
|Did I screw up your righteous-anger riff?
Does the nest of tumours|liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
But what you're doing is still very wrong.
You try vomiting for 24 hours because|the pain in your head is so intense, ..
and then we'll discuss|the concept of right and wrong.
These people are sheep.
They wanna be vampires cos they're lonely, ..
miserable or bored.
- I don't have a choice.
|- You have a choice.
You don't have a good choice,|but you have a choice.
You're opting for mass murder,|and nothing you say makes that OK!
- You think I need to justify myself to you?
|- This is all part of your little fantasy drama!
Isn't this exactly how you imagined it?
You tell me how you've suffered,|and I feel sorry for you.
Well, I do feel sorry for you.
And if those|vampires start feeding, I'll kill you myself!
You know what, Summers?
I really did miss you.
Ford help me stop this.
Please.
People, listen to me!
This is not the mother ship!
|This is ugly death come to play Take them all.
Save the Slayer for me.
Spike!
Everybody stop!
Good idea.
Now you let everybody out|or your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.
Let them go.
Down the stairs.
Uh, where's the doorknob?
- You guys are just in time.
|- Are there vampires?
They're contained.
They'll get out|eventually, though.
We should probably go.
We can come back when they're gone.
Come back for what?
For the body.
- What happened?
|- We're stuck in a basement.
Buffy?
She's not stuck in a basement.
Hey, well I delivered.
I handed her to you.
Yes.
I suppose you did.
So?
What about my reward?
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
You needn't say anything.
Be simpler if I could just hate him.
I think he wanted me to.
I think it made it|easier for him to be the villain of the piece.
Really he was just scared.
- Yes, I suppose he was.
|- Nothing's ever simple any more.
I'm constantly trying to work it out.
Who to love or hate, who to trust.
It's just like the more I know,|the more confused I get.
Well, I believe that's called growing up.
- I'd like to stop, then.
OK?
|- I know the feeling.
Does it ever get easy?
You mean life?
Yeah.
Does it get easy?
What do you want me to say?
Lie to me.
Yes, it's terribly simple.
|The good guys are always stalwart and true.
The bad guys are easily distinguished|by their pointy horns or black hats.
And we always defeat them and save the day.
No one ever dies and|everybody lives happily ever after.
Liar.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
In every generation there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires.
..
the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, Can I help you?
Rupert Giles.
I need to see him.
Mr Giles, he's our librarian.
Next building over, first door on your left.
You're welcome.
Oh, God.
Deidre?
Philip.
Help!
Help!
Somebody, please!
Must we have this noise|during your callisthenics?
It's not noise.
It's music.
I know music.
Music has notes.
This is noise.
I'm aerobicising.
I must have the beat.
Wonderful.
You work on your muscle tone|while my brain dribbles out of my ears.
Help!
Help, please!
Help me, somebody, please!
Very good.
And the rest is silence.
Time to go to sleep.
I'm on a beach.
But not an American beach.
One of those island beaches|where the water's way too blue.
And I'm laying on my towel.
|And it's just before sunset.
- And Gavin Rossdale's massaging my feet.
|- Oh, that's good!
I'm in Florence, Italy.
I've rented|this scooter that's parked outside.
And I'm in a little restaurant eating ziti.
And there are no more tables left ..
so they have to seat this guy with me,|and it's John Cusack.
- Very impressive.
You have an eye for detail.
|- Cos, with the ziti - What are you two up to?
|- Having a quick game of Anywhere But Here.
Oh!
Amy Yip at the water-slide park.
You never come up with anything new.
I'm just not fickle like you two.
|I'm constant in my affections.
Amy Yip at the water-slide park.
Do you think Giles ever played|Anywhere But Here when he was in school?
Giles lived for school.
|He's still bitter that there are only 12 grades.
He probably sat in math class thinking|"This could be mathier".
Come on!
You don't think|he got restless as a kid?
Are you kidding?
His diapers were tweed.
- Giles!
|- Oh.
There you are.
Hey, morning.
Say, is that tweed?
What?
Oh, yes.
- Now, look.
Tonight is very important.
|- Now that's a surprise!
What's on tap tonight that's so important?
|Uprising?
Prophesied ritual?
- Preordained death-fest?
|- Ah, the old standards.
Medical transport is delivering|a monthly supply of blood to the hospital.
- Vampire meals-on-wheels.
|- Hopefully not.
We'll meet outside the hospital at 8:30 sharp.
|I'll bring the weaponry.
- I'll bring the party mix.
|- Just don't be late.
- Have I ever let you down?
|- Shall I answer that or just glare?
- Morning, England.
|- Oh, hello, Ms, er Jenny.
- Feel the passion.
|- Willow.
Coughing, not speaking.
- Are we still on for tomorrow?
|- What's tomorrow?
Computer basics with|some students who've fallen behind.
- Willow's helping out for extra credit.
|- Those poor schlubs come in on Saturday.
Got a bit of schlub on your shoe there.
- Cordelia's gonna meet us.
|- Ooh, hear that?
A bonus day of class plus Cordelia.
Add|rectal surgery and it's my best day ever!
- Walk me to class?
|- Pleasure.
- Look at them.
|- A twosome of cuteness.
Can't you just image them getting together?
Thank you for loaning me|the Forester book.
It's wonderful.
- Glad you enjoyed it.
|- It was so romantic.
So evocative.
That edition was my father's.
|I must have read it 20 times.
You know how you dog-ear your favourite|pages so you can go back to them?
- What?
|- I had to fold back every single page.
So I just started underlining|all the pages I wanted to discuss.
- Underlined?
|- But then I spilt coffee all over it.
- I can't even read it.
|- It's a first edition.
I'm lying, Rupert.
The book's fine.
I just love to see you squirm.
Well, I trust I gave good squirm.
Did anyone ever tell you|you're a fuddy-duddy?
Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
Did anyone ever tell you|you're kind of a sexy fuddy-duddy?
No.
Actually, that part usually gets left out.
|I can't imagine why.
This weekend.
Would you like to go out?
Mm, no, I think I'd like to stay in.
- This Saturday.
|- Saturday night.
Let's see if I can make you squirm.
- Rupert Giles?
|- Yes?
Detective Winslow.
|You're gonna have to come with me.
- Why?
|- There was a homicide on campus last night.
The victim had no identification,|but he was carrying this slip of paper ..
with your name and address on it.
My name?
Evil just compounds evil, doesn't it?
First I get a computer tutorial on Saturday,|now I have to read some computer book.
There are books on computers?
Isn't|the point of computers to replace books?
Cordelia, I'm a little busy right now.
Oh, great!
Can you help me with a ticket?
|It's totally bogus.
It was a one-way street.
- I was going one way.
|- Cordelia!
What?
Why does everyone always|yell my name?
I'm not deaf.
And I can take a hint.
- What's the hint?
|- To come back later.
Yeah, when you've visited decaf land.
Where do you want me to go?
- Have you had your breakfast?
|- No.
That was probably a good idea.
- Do you know him?
|- Yes.
I mean I did.
His name's Philip Henry.
|He was a friend of mine in London.
I haven't spoken to him in 20 years.
Can you think of any reason|why he might have wanted to contact you?
No.
Do you know what that is?
- The tattoo?
|- No.
No, I don't.
"Don't be late".
Sheesh!
- Hey, fellas.
|- Hey.
All's well that ends|with cute ER doctors, I always say.
Since when do doctors take deliveries?
See ya!
Hey!
No samplin' the product.
- Angel!
|- Buffy.
Look out!
- How did you know about this?
|- It's delivery day.
Everybody knows about it.
They only ruined one bag.
Do you think you can make sure|the hospital gets the rest?
Thanks.
I'm worried about Giles.
- He was supposed to meet me here.
|- Maybe he's late.
Giles?
Who counts tardiness|as the eighth deadly sin?
You're right.
Go.
Buffy.
It's late.
Are you all right?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Yes.
No, I'm fine.
Fine.
I'm, er I'm rather busy at the moment|so I'll see you on Monday at school.
Did you forget?
The hospital?
Vampires?
|Handy cary-out packets of blood?
Yes.
Er Are you all right?
Were you hurt?
No.
I mean, my feelings a little.
- What's wrong?
|- Nothing, nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just in the middle of|something extremely important.
And I'm sorry,|but I'm gonna have to say good night now.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I realise it's five in the morning there.
I'm trying to reach Deidre Page.
My name is Rupert Giles.
She knows me.
It's very important.
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.
When did she, er pass away?
Oh.
That recently.
Erm Yes.
Yes.
We were friends when we were young.
My condolences.
So.
You're back.
This isn't right.
School on a Saturday.
|It throws off my internal clock.
When will we need computers for real life?
Let's see.
There's home, school, work, games.
Computers are on the way out.
|Paper's gonna make a comeback.
- And the abacus.
|- You know, you don't see enough abaci.
The first thing we're gonna do is Buffy?
- Did I fall asleep already?
|- You miss your friends.
- Sit here.
Demilitarise the zone between us.
|- Yeah, and de-louse him while you're at it.
- I wanted to talk to you for a second.
|- Is something wrong?
Is there some crisis that requires|instant action?
Very far from here?
- It's Giles.
|- Oh.
He's all right, isn't he?
I don't know.
He didn't show up|when he was supposed to last night.
Then, when I went over to his place,|he was acting well, very anti-Giles.
He wouldn't let me in.
|And he looked really bad.
I think he might have been - I think he was drinking.
|- He was home alone drinking?
- But tea, right?
|- It wasn't tea, Will.
Yep.
Yep, I knew this would happen.
Nobody can be as straight as Giles|without a dark side erupting.
My Uncle Roy was the stodgiest|taxidermist you've ever met, by day.
By night, it was booze, whores and fur flyin'.
- Were there whores?
|- He was alone.
- Give it time.
|- So, no one has noticed anything different?
- No.
|- Not really.
- You haven't seen anything weird?
|- Nope.
No.
He seemed perfectly normal yesterday|when I saw him talking to the police.
And you waited till now|to tell us this because?
- I didn't think it was important.
|- We understand.
It wasn't about you.
- What were the police talking to him about?
|- Oh, don't tell me.
I know this one.
Um Something about ..
a homicide.
That's it.
I'm calling him right now.
- I know you.
You ran that costume shop.
|- Oh, I'm pleased you remember.
That Halloween dress you sold me|nearly got us killed.
But you looked great.
- So now we're even?
|- I'll let you know when we're even.
- What are you doing here?
|- Snooping around.
- Honesty.
Nice touch.
|- It's one of my virtues.
- Not really.
|- I've got a great idea.
I'll call the police and have you arrested,|then I can get back to my fun Saturday.
The police.
They'll have all those questions|and they'll need Rupert to answer them.
- You know Giles.
|- We go back.
Way back.
You don't happen|to know where he is, do you?
- Hello.
|- Giles, it's me.
Buffy, unless this is an emergency,|I'll see you on Monday.
What's the Mark of Eyghon?
- Giles?
|- Cat got his tongue?
I'm in your office with someone who claims|to be an old friend of yours.
Ethan Rayne.
He's there with you?
Listen, Buffy.
|You're in grave danger while Ethan's there.
Put the phone down|and get out of the library now.
Not until you give me some answers.
Buffy!
Ethan!
Don't let him get away!
I'm not getting close enough|to feel his pulse, but he looks dead.
- Except for the attacking Buffy part.
|- He's dead.
Sorry, Philip.
Really, I am.
- Is everyone all right?
|- Super.
I kicked a guy.
- We're OK.
|- A dead guy here interrupted our tutorial.
Been meaning to thank you for that.
- It can't be.
|- Yes, it can.
- Hello, Ripper.
|- I thought I told you to leave town.
You did.
I didn't.
|Shop's lease is paid till the end of the month.
Why did he call him Ripper?
You should have left when I told you.
Giles!
You put these people in danger.
|The people I care about.
If you cared so much about them,|why didn't you leave town?
You've been having the dreams.
I know.
|I have.
We both know what's coming.
What dreams?
What is going on here?
- Tell her, Ripper.
|- Giles!
Jenny!
- There's something you don't see every day.
|- I'm gonna be in therapy till I'm 30.
Where's Ethan?
Where'd he go?
Are you all right, Jenny?
Careful.
Can you stand?
I think so.
This is what happens|when you have school on Saturday.
Lean on me.
It'll be all right.
- Promise?
|- I promise.
I believe you.
- How's your head?
|- Throbbing.
I lost Ethan.
Giles, what's going on?
It's complicated, Buffy.
|And quite frankly, it's private.
I don't care from private.
|I care from dead guys attacking us.
- I care from you lost-weekending at home.
|- I wasn't - I was just trying to find a solution.
|- Giles, share.
What is the Mark of Eyghon?
Hey!
This is not your battle.
As your Watcher, I'm telling|you unequivocally to stay out of it.
- I have to get Jenny home.
|- Mm.
Thank you.
We have work to do.
Willow, find out everything|about the Mark of Eyghon.
I'll try the Net.
But Mark of Eyghon|sounds like Giles-and-his-books sort of deal.
Then we hit the books.
Xander, how do you feel about|digging through Giles' personal files?
I feel pretty good about it.
|Does that make me a sociopath?
Nah!
- What?
|- What about me?
I care about Giles.
Work with Xander.
- When I say "care", I mean|- Cordelia!
OK, OK!
Thanks for bringing me here.
|I'm not quite ready to be home alone just yet.
Jenny I'm so very sorry about all of this.
I, er I never meant for you to be involved in ..
any of this.
So I got involved.
It's what happens|when two people get involved.
I really am gonna have to get you home.
It's not, er I'm not a very safe person|to be around at the moment.
Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert.
Don't you know that by now?
It's not Egyptian.
It's Etruscan,|mistaken for Egyptian by the design pattern.
But any fool can see|it predates their iconology.
Look, the Mark of Eyghon,|worn by his initiates.
"Eyghon, also called the sleepwalker,|can only exist in this reality ..
by possessing an unconscious host".
"Temporary possession imbues|the host with a euphoric feeling of power".
Yeah, but what about not temporary?
"Without the proper rituals,|possession is permanent ..
and Eyghon will be born|from within the host".
- I'm guessing eww.
|- Wait.
Hey, listen.
"Once called, Eyghon can also|take possession of the dead, ..
but its demonic energy|soon disintegrates the host ..
and it must jump to the nearest dead or|unconscious person to continue living".
- What does this have to do with Giles?
|- I don't know about Giles, ..
but ancient sects used to induce|possession for bacchanals and orgies.
OK.
Giles and orgies in the same sentence.
I could have lived without that one.
Wait a minute.
|The dead guy's all puddly now.
So the demon's gone.
|There was no one dead to jump into.
- I mean, we're all not dead, right?
|- No.
No one dead.
But someone unconscious.
- What was that?
|- What was what?
I thought I heard something.
I didn't.
Here.
Drink that and then I'll drive you home.
You could take me home ..
or you could take advantage|of me in my weakened state.
Thank you, operator.
There's no answer at Ms Calendar's|and Giles' phone is out of order.
I'm gonna go over there.
Jenny, erm - I'm really very attracted to you.
|- Good.
But now really isn't the right time.
Oh, there's never been a better time.
It's not right.
I would be taking advantage.
God, you just don't change, do you?
What?
"It's not right.
It wouldn't be proper".
"People might get hurt".
You're like a woman, Ripper.
You cry at every funeral.
You never had the strength for me.
You don't deserve me.
But guess what?
You've got me ..
under your skin.
Was it good for you?
Oh, you never had the stomach.
|But that's OK, ..
cos I'm about to rip it out.
Back off!
Three down, two to go.
Be seein' ya!
- Are you all right?
|- Jenny.
Oh, God.
- How do we stop this?
|- Oh, God.
What have I done?
Talk to me!
Giles, you're scaring me.
- I'm sorry.
|- Don't be sorry.
Be Giles.
Come on, we fight monsters.
|This is what we do.
They show up, I beat 'em up and|they go away.
This is no different.
It is.
- Because you don't know how to stop it?
|- Because I created it.
- Did you find anything?
|- Meticulous banking and phone records.
And, um this.
That's Giles?
I was 21.
Studying history at Oxford.
And, of course, the occult by night.
I hated it.
The tedious grind of study,|the overwhelming pressure of my destiny.
I dropped out.
Went to London.
Fell in with the worst crowd|that would have me.
We practised magics.
Small stuff, for pleasure or gain.
Then Ethan and I discovered something ..
bigger.
Eyghon.
Yes.
One of us would, um go into a deep sleep ..
and the others would summon him.
It was an extraordinary high.
God, we were fools.
- And you couldn't control it.
|- One of us, Randall, ..
he lost control.
Eyghon took him whole.
We tried|to exorcise the demon from Randall ..
but it killed him.
We killed him.
We thought we were free|of the demon after that.
But now he's back.
- And, one by one, he will kill us all.
|- Three down, two to go.
Then it's going after Ethan.
|I better beat it there.
- We'd better.
|- I'd better.
Giles, you're barely mobile|and speed is of the serious essence here.
I don't know how to stop it|without killing Jenny.
I've got the guys working on it.
I'll, um try to contain it|until we figure something.
Buffy.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Ethan?
Ethan!
Giles told me everything.
Look, it's coming for you.
And you came to protect me.
I'm touched.
Don't worry.
It's nothing personal.
To protect Giles, I have to protect you.
How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
- Cos he's Giles.
|- And I'm not.
- Still, lucky me.
|- Hm.
Lucky you.
Well, we can't run.
Eyghon will find us.
- This mark's like a homing beacon.
|- It's OK.
I'm not into running.
- Aren't we manly?
|- One of us is.
You're gonna hide till it's over.
- Excellent plan.
|- Is there a way into the back?
There's a back door.
It's locked.
|I think it's solid.
We'll set up there.
Let's go.
Oh, no.
Please.
Ladies first.
Wakey wakey.
You're missing all the fun.
- What fun?
|- Your initiation.
You know what?
|I'm not interested in joining your club.
Too late.
I already voted you in.
You know, I hope you're not|taking this personally, Buffy.
I actually kind of like you.
|It's just that I like myself a lot more.
If you think of it karmically,|this is really big for your soul.
Taking my place with the demon,|giving so that others may live.
I'm gonna kill you.
|Will that blow the karma thing?
Sweet child.
|Now this may sting a little, just at first.
But don't worry, that'll go away|once the searing pain kicks in.
You can go ahead and scream if you like.
We have to figure out how to kill|this thing and we need to do it fast.
- Uh hot lava.
|- That's for a heretic.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, OK.
Buy a potato.
No, that's for warts.
Who writes this stuff?
I've got the solution right here.
"To kill a demon, cut off its head".
Oh, yeah - find Ms Calendar,|then decapitate her.
She'll be our first headless teacher.
|You think anybody'll notice?
Do you know what you need|besides a supply of acne cream?
A brain.
That's it!
12 years of you and I'm snappin'!
|I don't care if you're a girl.
I'm throwin' down.
- I've seen you fight.
I can take you.
|- Give it your best shot.
Hey!
We don't have time for this.
Our friends are in trouble.
We have to put|our heads together and get them out of it!
And if you two aren't with me 110%,|then get the hell out of my library.
- We're sorry.
|- We'll be good.
OK.
Now, we've done the research.
We just have to figure out how to use it.
Why not find another dead body|for the demon to jump into?
Yes!
At the cemetery.
That won't kill the demon.
|It'll only give it a change of scenery.
Oh, I've got it.
I've got it!
She's good.
I think I missed my calling as an artist.
Listen to me.
This is a bad idea.
You're|dealing with something very dangerous.
But it will get Eyghon off my scent.
Relax.
I've finished with you.
This is for me.
Ethan?
Well, I hate to mutilate and run, but It's your time.
Eyghon!
Take me.
Buffy, get out of here.
No!
No!
I've been waiting a long time to do this.
- He's killing her.
|- No, trust me.
This is gonna work.
Jenny!
- Jenny?
|- Rupert.
You knew that a demon in trouble|would jump into a dead person.
- I put it in danger.
|- And it jumped.
I've had a demon inside me|for a couple of hundred years ..
just waitin' for a good fight.
- Winner and still champion.
|- I think that Ethan guy disappeared again.
Darn.
I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
Well, at least it's over.
The worst thing is|I was saving up for some important shoes, ..
and now I have to blow my allowance|to get this stupid tattoo removed.
- Let's just hope my mom doesn't see it first.
|- Puttin' that demon into Angel was brill.
I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
- But it did.
|- Like a charm.
- You should consider a career as a Watcher.
|- I don't think I could handle the stress.
And the dental plan is crap.
I don't see how Giles does it.
I don't think he has a choice.
Jenny.
Jenny.
Rupert.
Hi.
I tried to call you last night.
|See how you were.
Yeah.
I left my phone off the hook.
I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.
- You're all right?
Is there anything you need?
|- No, I'm fine.
I mean, I'm not running around,|wind-in-my-hair, ..
the-hills-are-alive-with-|the-sound-of-music fine, but ..
I'm coping.
- I would like to help.
|- I know.
Perhaps we could, um talk some time.
Dinner, or a drink?
- When you're feeling stronger.
|- Sure.
Some time.
Yeah.
Some time.
I better get to class.
Of course.
Hey.
Is she OK?
- The hills are not alive.
|- I'm sorry to hear that I think.
I don't think she'll ever really forgive me.
|Maybe she shouldn't.
Maybe you should.
I never wanted you to see that side of me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was scary.
I'm so used to you being a grown-up, ..
and then I find out that you're a person.
Most grown-ups are.
Who would have thought?
Some are even short-sighted|foolish people.
So.
After all this time, ..
we finally find out|that we do have something in common.
Which, apart from being a little weird, ..
is kind of OK?
I think we're supposed to be training now.
Yes, yes.
We need to concentrate on your flexibility.
And you know what?
|I have just the perfect music.
Go on, say it.
You know you want to.
It's not music, it's just meaningless sounds.
- There.
Feel better?
|- Yes.
Thanks.
The Bay City Rollers.
Now that's music.
I didn't hear that.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
"Are you a people person or do you|prefer keeping your own company"?
Well, what if I'm a people person|who keeps his own company by default?
- Mark "none of the above".
|- There are no boxes for "none of the above".
That would introduce too many variables|into their number-crunching little world.
I sense bitterness.
No, but these people can't tell from one test|what we're gonna do for the rest of our lives.
I'm kinda curious to find out|what sort of career I could have.
And suck the spontaneity out of being|young and stupid?
I'd rather be in the dark.
- We're not gonna be young for ever.
|- Yes, but I'll always be stupid.
OK, let's not all rush to disagree.
You're not stupid.
"I aspire to help my fellow man".
Check.
As long as he's not smelly,|dirty or something gross.
Cordelia Chase - always ready to give|a helping hand to the rich and the pretty.
Which, lucky me, excludes you.
Twice.
Is murder always a crime?
- Do I like shrubs?
|- That's between you and your God.
- What did you put?
|- I came down on the side of shrubs.
Go shrubs!
OK.
Oh I shouldn't even be bothering with this.
|It's all mootville for me.
No matter what my test says,|we know my deal.
- Yep!
High-risk.
Sub-minimum wage.
|- Pointy wooden things?
- Then why are you taking the test?
|- It's Principal Snyder's hoop of the week.
He's not happy unless I'm jumping.
|I would not be here otherwise.
You're not a teensy-weensy bit curious|about what career you could have had?
If you weren't already the Slayer 'n' all.
Do the words "sealed" and "fate"|ring any bells, Will?
Why go there?
You know, with that kind of attitude, you|could have had a bright future at the DMV.
I'm sorry.
It's just Unless Hell freezes over|and every vamp here puts in for retirement, ..
I'd say my future is pretty much a non issue.
- Read it again.
|- I'm not sure.
It could be, uh ..
"deprimere ille bubula linter, " Debase the beef canoe.
Why does that strike me as not right?
Spike, come dance.
Give us some peace, would you?
|Can't you see I'm workin'?
I'm sorry, kitten.
It's just this manuscript.
It's supposed|to hold your cure, but it reads like gibberish.
Even Dalton, the big brain,|can't make heads or tails of it.
I I need to change Miss Edith.
Oh, forgive me.
You know I can't stand to see you like this.
We're runnin' out of time.
It's that bloody Slayer.
Whatever I do,|she's muckin' up the works.
You'll make it right.
I know.
Well Come on now Enlighten me.
Well it looks like Latin, but it's not.
|I'm not even sure it's a language Then make it a language!
|Isn't that what a transcriber does?
- Well, not exactly|- I want the cure.
Find Why not?
Some people|find pain very inspirational.
He can't help you.
Not without the key.
The key?
You mean this book|is in some kind of code?
Yeah.
- Is that where we'll find this key?
|- Yeah I'll send the boys pronto.
Now will you dance?
I'll dance with you, pet, ..
on the Slayer's grave.
Does "rest in peace" have|no sanctity to you people?
Oh.
I forgot.
You're not a people.
One down One gone.
Buffy You scared me.
Now you know|what it feels like, Stealth Guy.
Just droppin' by for some|quality time with Mr Gordo?
- Excuse me?
|- The pig.
Oh!
I, uh What's up?
Nothing.
You don't have a "nothing" face.
|You have a "something" face.
And you don't have to whisper.
Mom's in LA|till Thursday - art buying or something.
Then why'd you come in|through the window?
Habit.
I wanted to make sure you're OK.
|I had a bad feeling.
There's a surprise.
|Angel comes with bad news.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
Look I've been Cranky Miss all day.
It's not you.
- What is it, then?
|- It's nothing.
- We're having this thing at school|- Career week?
- How did you know?
|- I lurk.
Right.
Well, you know it's a whole week of|What's My Line, only I don't get to play.
- Sometimes I just want|- You want what?
It's OK.
The Cliffs Notes version?
I want a normal life, like I had before.
Before me.
No, Angel, it's not you.
You're the one freaky thing in my freaky|world that still makes sense to me.
I just get messed sometimes.
I wish we could be regular kids.
Yeah.
I'll never be a kid.
OK.
A regular kid and her cradle-robbing,|creature-of-the-night boyfriend.
Was this part of your normal life?
Oh, my gosh!
My Dorothy Hamill phase.
|My room in LA was pretty much a shrine.
Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters.
|I even got the Dorothy haircut.
Thereby securing a place|in the geek hall of fame.
- And you wanted to be like her.
|- I wanted to be her.
My parents were fighting all the time|and skating was an escape.
I felt safe.
When was the last time|you put on your skates?
About a couple of hundred demons ago.
There's a rink out past Route 17|that's closed on Tuesdays.
- Tomorrow's Tuesday.
|- I know.
Oh, here I am.
Personal shopper|or motivational speaker.
Neato.
Motivational speaker on what?
|Ten ways to a more annoying you?
Um What about you?
You're What?
What!
You and Angel are going skating?
Alone?
Unless some unforeseen evil pops up.
|But I'm in full see-no-evil mode.
- Angel ice-skating?
|- I know.
Two worlds collide.
Wouldn't you two say|you know me as well as anyone?
- Maybe better than I know myself?
|- What's this about?
When you look at me,|do you think prison guard?
Um Crossing guard maybe,|but prison guard?
They just put up the assignments|for the career fair ..
and I can look forward to being gainfully|employed in the growing field of corrections.
Well, at least you'll be|on the right side of the bars.
Laugh now, missy.
They assigned you to|the booth for law enforcement professionals.
- As in police?
|- As in polyester, doughnuts and brutality.
But doughnuts!
Well, I'll just jump off that bridge|when I come to it.
First I have to deal with Giles.
He's on|this Tony Robbins hyper-efficiency kick.
Expects me to check in every day|after homeroom.
Police You didn't check to see which seminar|I was assigned to, did you?
- I did and you weren't.
|- I wasn't what?
- On the list.
|- But I handed in my test.
I used a No.
2 pencil.
- Then I guess you must have passed.
|- It's not the kind of test you pass or fail.
Your name wasn't up there, Will.
Buffy.
Thank you.
I've been indexing the Watcher diaries|covering the last couple of centuries.
You'd be amazed at how pompous and|long-winded some of these watchers were.
Colour me stunned.
So, uh, I trust last night's patrol was fruitful?
Semi.
I caught one out of two vamps after|they stole something from this mausoleum.
- They were stealing?
|- With tools, flashlights.
Whole nine yards.
What does that mean anyway?
|Whole nine yards.
Nine yards of what?
Now it's gonna bug me all day.
Giles, you're in pace mode.
What gives?
Um This vampire who escaped,|did you see what he took?
No, but I can guess|and say it was something old.
- You didn't try to find out what was taken?
|- Have a cow, Giles.
I just figured it was|your everyday vamp high jinks.
What if it wasn't?
This could be very serious.
If you'd made an effort to be more thorough If you don't like the way I do my job,|why don't you find somebody else?
Oh!
That's right.
There can only be one.
|As long as I'm alive there is no one else.
Well, there you go.
I don't have|to be the Slayer.
I could be dead.
That wasn't terribly funny.
|You notice I don't laugh.
Wouldn't be much of a change.
|Either way I'm bored, constricted.
I never get to shop, and my hair|and fingernails continue to grow.
So, really, when you think about it,|what's the diff?
Do we have to be introspective now?
Our concern is to discover what was|stolen from that mausoleum last night.
- This is it, then.
|- It hums.
I can hear it.
Once you're well again,|we'll have a coronation down main street.
And invite everyone.
And drink|for seven days and seven nights.
What about the Slayer?
She almost|blew the whole thing for us.
She's trouble.
You don't say!
Trouble?
She's the gnat in my ear.
The gristle in my teeth.
She's the bloody thorn in my bloody side!
- Spike?
|- We've gotta do something.
We'll never complete your cure|with that bitch breathing down our necks.
I need to bring in the big guns.
|They'll take care of her once and for all.
- Big guns?
|- The Order of Taraka.
The bounty hunters?
They're coming to my party.
Three of them.
Yes, but The Order of Taraka, I mean - Isn't that overkill?
|- No.
I think it's just enough kill.
Willow?
What are you doing here?
|Fly.
Be free, little bird.
You defy category.
- I'm looking for Buffy.
|- She went with Giles about an hour ago.
- Some kind of field trip.
|- If she's not back soon, Snyder's really ..
done a great job with the fair, hasn't he?
Principal Snyder, great career fair, sir.
Really.
I'm so inspired by your leadership,|I'm thinkin' principal school.
I wanna walk in your shoes.
Not your|actual shoes, of course, because you're tiny.
Not tiny in the small sense, of course.
|OK, I'm done now.
- Where is she?
|- Who?
- You know who.
|- You mean Buffy?
I just saw her Don't feed me that "I just saw her a minute|ago, she's around here somewhere" story.
But I did just see her a minute ago|and she is around here somewhere.
- For what it's worth|- It's worth nothing, Harris.
Whatever comes out of your mouth|is a waste of breath, an airborne toxic event.
I'm glad you feel comfortable enough|to be so honest with me.
I can only hope that one day|I'm in the position to be that honest with you.
Fascinating.
Well, love to chat, but I got an appointment|with the warden on riot procedure.
Ciao, OK.
See ya.
Willow Rosenberg?
Come with us, please.
- Excuse me?
|- Let's walk.
Try the canapé.
It's excellent.
What is all this?
You're to meet with Mr McCarthy, recruiter|for the world's leading software concern.
The jet was delayed by fog,|but he should be here any minute.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
But I didn't even get my test back.
That was irrelevant.
|We've tracked you for some time.
- Is that a good thing?
|- I would think so.
We're extremely selective.
In fact, only one|other Sunnydale student met our criteria.
Canapé?
Buffy!
Slow down, please!
Giles, we have work to do.
|Get with the programme.
You're being remarkably immature.
You know why?
I am immature.
|I'm a teen.
I've yet to mature.
I was simply offering|some constructive criticism.
No.
You were harsh.
God, you act like I picked this gig,|but remember I'm the picked.
What you have is more than a gig.
|It's a sacred duty.
Which shouldn't prevent you from eventually|procuring some more gainful employment.
Such as I did.
Giles, it's one thing to be|a watcher and a librarian.
They go together,|like chicken and another chicken, ..
or two chickens, or something.
|You know what I'm saying!
No one blinks an eye if you spend|all your days with books.
What can I do?
Carve stakes for a nursery?
Point taken.
I must admit I've never really Now, there's a thought!
|Have you ever considered law enforcement?
What?
- May I?
|- Be my guest.
It's a reliquary, ..
used to house items|of religious significance.
Most commonly a finger|or another body part from a saint.
Note to self: religion - freaky.
Du Lac.
- Oh dear, oh dear.
|- I hate when you say that.
Josephus du Lac was buried here.
He was in a sect that was excommunicated|by the Vatican at the turn of the century.
Excommunicated and sent to Sunnydale.
|There's a guy big with the sinning.
Remember the book that was stolen|from the library a few weeks ago?
- Yeah.
|- It was written by du Lac.
Damn it!
I let it slip my mind with all the excitement.
I guess it wasn't|a Taste of the Vatican cookbook.
No, the book was said to contain rituals|and spells that reap unspeakable evil.
However, it was written in archaic Latin so|that only sect members could understand it.
- So everything's cool.
|- It's not.
First the book was taken ..
and now the vampires have stolen|something from du Lac's tomb.
Do you think they figured out|how to read the book?
Something's coming, Buffy.
|Whatever it is, I can guarantee it's not good.
Bus 219, continuing service to Los Angeles,|now arriving Sunnydale - Mrs Kalish?
|- Yes.
Hello.
I'm Norman Pfister|with Blush Beautiful Skincare.
I'm not selling anything, so I'm not asking|you to buy, just to accept a few free samples.
- Free?
|- Absolutely.
What the hell?
Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!
Hey, come on!
So Giles is sure the vampire|who stole his book ..
is linked to the one you slayed last night?
- Or is it "slew"?
|- Both are correct.
And yes.
I'm sure.
Du Lac was both a theologian|and a mathematician.
This article describes an invention of his|which he called the du Lac Cross.
Why go to the trouble of inventing something|and then give it a weak name?
I mean, I'd have gone with the Cross-o-matic|or the Amazing Mr Cross.
The Cross was more than a symbol.
It was|used to understand certain mystical texts.
To decipher hidden meanings and so forth.
So you're saying these vampires went to|all this hassle for a basic decoder ring?
Actually, yes.
I suppose I am.
According to this, du Lac destroyed|every Cross except the one buried with him.
- Why destroy your own work?
|- He feared it might fall into the wrong hands.
A fear we'll soon get to experience|for ourselves, up close in person.
Unless we can pre-empt their plans.
How?
By learning what's in the book|before they do.
Which means we can expect|to be here late tonight.
Goody!
Research party!
Will, you need a life in the worst way.
Speaking of I have to bail, but I'll be back|bright and early tomorrow and ready to slay.
- This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy.
|- I realise that.
You have to admit|I kinda lack in the book area.
You guys are the brains.
|I'll only be here for moral support.
That's untrue, Buff.
You totally contribute.
|You go for snacks!
She should go you know|gather her strength.
Perhaps you're right.
|There may be fierce battles ahead.
But HoHos are a vital part|of my cognitive process.
Sorry, Xand.
Someplace I have to be.
Buffy!
He is passing|under our feet right now.
No worries.
We're close to decoding|the manuscript.
We just need a bit more time.
Time is ours.
|It brings the Slayer closer to them.
The Hellmouth presents Dead Guys on Ice,|Not exactly the evening we were aiming for.
You're in danger.
|You know what the ring means?
- I just killed a Super Bowl champ?
|- I'm serious!
Just go home and wait till you hear from me.
Are you OK?
- What about you?
That cut|- Forget about me.
We gotta get you out.
- You mean hide?
|- Let's get you someplace safe!
No!
Your eye Hey!
Don't be a baby.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
- It's not that|- What?
You shouldn't have to touch me|when I'm like this.
I didn't even notice.
This guy was hard-core, Giles.
|And Angel was power-freaked by that ring.
He was not overreacting.
This ring is worn|only by members of the Order of Taraka.
It's a society of deadly assassins|dating back to King Solomon.
Didn't they beat the Elks|in the Sunnydale adult bowling league?
Their credo is to sow discord|and kill the unwary.
- Bowling is a vicious game.
|- That's enough, Xander!
Sorry.
It's just not the time for jokes.
|I need to think.
- Why are they after me?
|- Cos you're the scourge of the underworld?
I haven't been that scourgey lately.
I don't know, I don't know.
I think the best thing we can do|is to find a secure location.
Somewhere out of the way you can go|until we decide on the best course of action.
OK.
Now you and Angel|have both said to head for the hills.
Are you saying I can't handle this?
|That I can't fight these people?
They're a breed apart, Buffy.
Unlike vampires, they have no earthly|desires but to collect their bounty.
They find a target and, uh they eliminate it.
You can kill as many of them as you like.
|It'll make no difference.
Where there's one,|there will be another and another.
They won't stop coming until the job is done.
Each one of them works alone, his own way, Some are human, Some are not, You won't know who they are|until they strike, Try it!
- Try what?
|- Uh I'm sorry.
I'm still not clear what I'm supposed to try.
Nothing.
God, I'm sorry.
I That is a tense person.
I wish there was more we could do.
We're doing all that we can.
The only course of action is to try|and find out what was in that stolen book.
I've never seen Buffy like that.
|She just took off.
She didn't go home.
The phone rang a few hundred times,|then I remembered her mom is out of town.
Maybe Buffy unplugged the phone.
No, it's a statistical impossibility|for a 16-year-old girl to unplug her phone.
Well, perhaps my words of caution|were a little too alarming.
- You think?
|- It's good that she took you seriously, Giles.
I just wish we knew where she was.
Angel?
We're closed!
Can't you read the sign?
Hey, Angel.
I didn't recognise you|in the dark there.
What, uh What can I do for you tonight?
- I need some information.
|- Yeah?
Man, that's too bad cos|I'm stayin' away from that whole scene.
- I'm livin' right, Angel.
|- Sure you are, Willy.
And I'm takin' up sunbathing.
Come on, man Don't be that way.
I treat you vamps good.
|I don't hassle you.
You don't hassle me.
We all enjoy the patronage|of this establishment.
Everybody's happy!
Who sent them?
- Who sent who?
|- The Order of Taraka.
I I tell ya I haven't been in the loop.
Let's try again.
The Order of Taraka.
|They're after the Slayer.
Come on, man Was it Spike?
Look, Angel.
I got some good|pig's blood in.
Good stuff You know I'm a little rusty|at killin' humans.
It could take a while.
- Spike will draw and quarter me, man!
|- I'll take care of Spike.
You know he ordered those guys!
|Spike's sick of your girl getting in his way.
- Where can I find him?
|- I tell you that, ..
I'll need relocating expenses.
It'll cost ya.
- It'll cost who?
|- OK, OK.
He and that freaky chick of his Who are you?
If you tell me|what I need to know, I won't hurt you.
You think this is funny?
I think it is funny now.
- That girl, the one I saw you with before|- You stay away from her.
I'm afraid you are not|in a position to threaten.
- When I get outta here, I'll do more than that.
|- Then I suggest you move quickly.
Eastern exposure.
|The sun will be comin' in a few hours.
More than enough time|for me to find your girlfriend.
Xander?
No, I haven't heard from Buffy yet.
I think|you should go to her house and check on her.
Well right away.
I don't know!
Get Cordelia to drive you.
- Willow|- Don't warn the tadpoles!
- Are you all right?
|- What are you doing here?
It's the library, Willow.
You fell asleep.
Oh, I Don't warn the tadpoles?
I I have frog fear.
I'm sorry.
I conked out.
Oh, please.
You've gone|quite beyond the call of duty.
But fortunately, I think|I may have found something finally.
I found a description of the missing|du Lac manuscript.
It's a ritual, Willow.
Now, I haven't managed to decipher|the exact details, but I I believe the purpose is to restore|a weak and sick vampire back to full health.
- A vampire like Drusilla?
|- Exactly.
By George, I think he's got it!
The key to your cure, ducks.
The missing bloody link.
It was Right right in front of us the whole time.
I can't even believe you.
You got me out of|bed for a ride?
Am I mass transportation?
That's what a lot of guys say,|but it's just locker-room talk.
Great.
So I'm your taxi|and your punching bag.
I like to think of you more as|my witless foil, but have it your way.
Buffy!
Come on, Cordelia.
To be in the Scooby Gang|you gotta be inconvenienced now and then.
Right.
Cos I lie awake at night|hoping you tweekos will be my best friends.
And that my first husband|will be a balding, homeless man!
- Buffy could be in trouble.
|- What if she is?
What are you gonna do?
If you haven't noticed, you're|the lameness and she's the superchick.
At least I'm the lameness who cares,|which is more than you do.
Buffy!
I'm gonna check upstairs.
Buffy!
Good day.
I'm Norman Pfister with|Blush Beautiful Skincare and Cosmetics.
I was wondering if I might|interest you in some free samples.
Free?
You must be number two.
Thanks for the wake-up,|but I'll stick with my clock radio.
Don't make me do the chick-fight thing.
- Chick fight?
|- You know - Who are you?
|- Who am I?
- You attacked me!
Who the hell are you?
|- I am Kendra.
The Vampire Slayer.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
OK.
One more time.
You're the who?
I'm the Slayer.
Nice cover story, but here's a tip.
- Try it on someone who's not the real Slayer.
|- You can't stop me.
Even if you kill me,|another slayer will be sent to take me place.
Stop with the slayer thing!
I'm the Slayer!
Nonsense.
There is but one ..
and I am she.
OK Scenario You back off.
I'll back off.
But you promise not to go all wiggy until|we can go to my watcher and figure this out.
Wiggy?
You know no kicko, no fighto.
I accept your scenario.
So you were sent here?
Yes.
By my watcher.
- To do what exactly?
|- To do my duty.
I'm here to kill vampires.
Your watcher is Sam Zabuto, you say?
Yes, sir.
We've never met.
He's very well respected.
What?
So he's a real guy, as in non-fictional?
- And you are called?
|- I am the Vampire Slayer.
We got that part, honey.
|He means your name.
They call me Kendra.
I have no last name, sir.
- Can you say stuck in the '80s?
|- Buffy, please.
There's obviously some misunderstanding.
Hey!
- Identify yourself!
|- Back off, Pink Ranger!
- This is my friend.
|- Friend?
Yeah.
As in person you hang with?
Amigo?
I don't understand.
You try.
I'm tapped.
Kendra, there are a few people - civilians,|if you like - who know Buffy's identity.
Willow is one of them.
|They also spend time together socially.
- And you allow this, sir?
|- Well, uh But the Slayer must work|in secret, for security.
Of course.
But with Buffy, however, it's, um Some flexibility is required.
- Why?
|- Hi, guys.
What's goin' on?
Apparently, there's been a really big mix-up.
It seems somehow that another slayer|has been sent to Sunnydale.
Is that even possible?
|I mean, two slayers at the same time?
Not to my knowledge.
Um The new slayer is|only called after the previous slayer has died.
Good Lord.
- You were dead, Buffy.
|- I was only gone for a minute.
Clearly that doesn't matter.
You were physically dead, thus causing|the activation of the next slayer.
- She died?
|- Just a little.
She drowned.
She was revived.
So there really are two of them.
It would seem so.
This is completely|unprecedented.
I'm quite flummoxed.
What's the flum?
It's a mistake.
|She shouldn't be here.
She goes home.
Look, I don't mean this personally,|but I'm not dead ..
and, frankly, having you around|creeps me out a bit.
I cannot just leave.
|I was sent here for a reason.
Mr Zabuto said all the signs indicate that a|very dark power's about to rise in Sunnydale.
And what's your plan for fighting this dark|power?
You gonna attack people randomly?
Of course not.
- Then why the hell did you attack me?
|- I thought you were a vampire.
- A swing and a miss for the rookie.
|- I had good reason to think you were.
- Did I not see you kissing a vampire?
|- Buffy would never do that!
Oh Except for sometimes you do that.
But only with Angel Right?
Yes.
Right.
Look, you saw me with Angel|and he is a vampire, but he's good.
Angel?
You mean Angelus?
I've read about him.
He is a monster.
No, no, no.
He's good now.
Really!
- He had a Gypsy curse.
|- He has a what?
Just trust me on this one, OK?
|He's on the home team now.
I cannot believe you.
He looked to me|just like another animal when I When you what?
What did you do to him?
- I|- What did you do?
Here you go, friend.
He'll be as good as new in a day or so.
|Wait, wait, wait We had a deal, right?
What's the matter, Willy?
Don't you trust me?
Oh, yeah.
Like a brother.
Talk, and I'll have your guts for garters.
Wild horses couldn't drag it.
Oops!
Sorry, friend.
- What are you gonna do with him anyway?
|- I'm thinkin' maybe dinner and a movie.
Don't want to rush into anything.
|I've been hurt, you know.
Do you have anything in raisin?
I know you wouldn't think so,|but I'm both a winter and a summer.
$9.99, tax included.
You said that already.
|Do you have anything in the berry family?
- Are there more ladies in the house?
|- Oh, no.
They're not home.
You know, nothing personal, but maybe|you should look into selling dictionaries or ..
some - Hey, what's up?
|- He's a salesman and he was just leaving.
- Uh OK.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
|- OK, Mary Kay.
Time to Time to run!
Find something to cover|the crack under the door!
Here!
I don't do worms!
Cover me.
Angel!
- No ashes.
|- What?
When a vampire combusts, he leaves ashes.
- Yeah, I know the drill.
|- So I did not kill him.
And I don't need to kill you.
Whoa!
There's a lot of tension in this room.
- Don't you say hello where you come from?
|- This one is dirty!
I can feel it!
That's good for you, Percepto Girl, but we'll|get nothing out of him if he's unconscious.
- Where's Angel?
|- My buddy Angel?
You think I'd let him fry?
I saved him in the nick.
|He was close to being a crispy critter.
- Where'd he go?
|- He said he was gonna stay underground.
You know recuperate.
Are you telling the truth?
I swear on my mother's grave|should she die, God forbid.
Then he is all right.
We can return|to your watcher for our orders.
I don't take orders.
I do things my way.
- No wonder you died.
|- Let's go.
I I have to ask.
Has either of you girls|considered modelling?
I have a friend with a camera.
|Strictly high-class nude work.
You know, art photographs, but naked.
You don't have to answer right away.
I was dreaming.
Of what, pet?
We were in Paris.
You had a branding iron.
I brought you something.
And there were worms in my baguette.
Your sire, my sweet.
- Angel?
|- The one and only.
Now all we need is the full moon tonight.
And he will die and you will be|fully restored, my black goddess.
My ripe, wicked plum.
- It's been|- For ever.
Spike, let me have him.
Mm?
Until the moon.
All right.
You can play, ..
but don't kill him.
|He mustn't die till the ritual.
Bring him to me.
You've been a very bad daddy.
Kendra, I've conferred with|your watcher, Mr Zabuto.
We both agree that until this matter|with Spike and Drusilla is resolved, - ..
you two should work together.
|- Oh, that'll be a treat.
So you believe that Spike is attempting|to revive this Drusilla to health.
Yes, well, I think that's the dark power|that your watcher referred to.
You see, Drusilla's not only evil.
|She's also quite mad.
If she was restored to her health, then|well, there's no telling what she might do.
- Then we will stop Spike.
|- Good plan!
Let's go!
Charge!
- Buffy|- It's a little more complicated, John Wayne.
Yes, it is.
Spike has also called out the Order|of Taraka to keep Buffy out of the way.
The assassins?
I read of them|in the writings of Dramius.
- Oh, really?
Which volume?
|- I believe it was six, sir.
- Um How do you know all this?
|- From my studies.
So obviously you have a lot of free time.
I study because it is required.
|The Slayer Handbook insists on it.
- There's a slayer handbook?
|- Handbook?
How come I don't have one?
Is there a T-shirt too?
Cos that would be cool.
After meeting you, Buffy, I realised that the|handbook would be of no use in your case.
What do you mean "of no use in my case"?
|What's wrong with my case?
Kendra, perhaps you could show me where in|Dramius 6 it refers to the Order of Taraka?
I could never get through|that book - a bit stodgy!
It was difficult.
All those footnotes Welcome to Planet Pocket Protector.
Oh, uh Buffy, Principal Snyder|was snooping round after you.
Ew Career fair.
- Best make an appearance, I think.
|- Right.
- Buffy's a student here?
|- Yes.
Right.
Of course.
|And I imagine she's a cheerleader as well.
Oh, no.
She had to give up her cheerleading.
|It was quite an amusing story actually Let's go and find the book, shall we?
- Get a load of the she-Giles.
|- Creepy!
I bet Giles wishes I was more of a book geek.
Giles is enough of a book geek|for the both of you.
Yeah, but did you see how they were vibing?
|"Volume 6.
Ha-ha-ha"!
Buffy, no one could replace you.
|You'll always be Giles' favourite.
I wonder.
Of course you will.
|You're his slayer.
The real Slayer.
No I wonder if it would be so bad,|being replaced.
- You mean, like, letting Kendra take over?
|- Maybe.
Maybe after this thing|with Spike and the assassins, ..
I could say "Kendra, you slay.
|I'm going to Disneyland".
But not for ever, right?
No.
Disneyland would get boring|after a few months.
But I could do other stuff.
Career day stuff.
Maybe I could even have a normal life.
Could you sit down?
|You're makin' me queasy.
You're just sitting there!
|You should think up a plan.
- I have a plan.
We wait.
Buffy saves us.
|- How will she know where to find us?
Cordelia, this is Buffy's house.
|Odds are she'll find us.
What if she doesn't?
Am I going to|waste away down here with you?
- No, thank you.
|- What are you doin'?
- Going to see if he's gone!
|- What if he isn't?
Right!
So we should just slack here and|hope somebody else decides to be a hero?
Sorry.
Forgot I was stranded with a loser!
And I'm stuck with the numb-brain that|let Mr Mutant inside in the first place!
He looked normal!
Is he supposed to have|"assassin" over his head?
!
All it took was the chance of a free makeover|and you licked his hand like a dumb dog!
You know what?
I'm going.
I'd rather be worm food|than look at your face!
- Then go.
I'm not stoppin' ya.
|- I bet you wouldn't.
I bet you'd let a girl go off|to her doom all by herself.
Not just any girl.
You're special.
I can't believe that I'm spending what will|probably be my last few moments with you!
I hope these are my last moments.
Three|more seconds with you and I'm gonna - I'm gonna what, coward?
|- Moron.
- I hate you!
|- I hate you!
We so need to get outta here.
He's gone.
Oh, my God!
My God!
Get them off of me!
Just get them off!
Get them off of me!
Oh, my God!
Get them off OK, OK!
Let's get out of here!
Xander, let's go!
OK?
Let's go!
My tests say that I should look into|law enforcement and environmental design.
Environmental design.
|That's landscaping, right?
I checked the shrub box.
But landscaping was yesterday,|so law enforcement it is.
Will, don't look, OK?
No, don't look.
That|guy over there is totally checking you out.
Oh, that's Oz.
He's expressing|computer nerd solidarity.
Really?
Then why is he|on his way over right now?
Told you.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
- Your hair is brown.
|- Oh, yeah, sometimes.
So did you decide?
Are you gonna be|a corporate computer suit guy?
Oh Oh, well, I think I'm gonna|finish high school first.
What about you?
I'm not really a computer person, you know,|or a work-of-any-kind person.
- Then why did they select you?
|- Well, I sorta test well, ..
which is cool, except then it leads to jobs.
- Don't you have some ambition?
|- Oh, yeah.
E flat diminished ninth.
- Huh?
|- Well, the E flat, it's doable ..
but it's that diminished ninth, you know|it's a man's chord.
You could lose a finger.
All right, listen up|and answer when I call your name!
Buffy Summers?
- Get down!
|- Look out!
He's He's shot!
Are you OK?
Yeah I'm shot, you know!
Wow!
It's odd and painful.
She's gone.
Was that a demonstration?
She was definitely in the Taraka gang,|and way gun-happy.
This, um Oz chappie, he's all right?
The paramedic said it was only a scrape.
|Thank goodness.
Down, girl!
Who sponsored career day today?
|The British soccer fan association?
We had a rather violent visit|from the Order of Taraka.
You wanna talk Order of Taraka?
|We just met the king freak of the Hello!
Oh, forgive me.
|Xander, Cordelia, this is Kendra.
It's rather complicated,|but she's also a slayer.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
A slayer, huh?
I knew this "I'm the only one" thing|was just an attention-getter.
Just say hello, Xander.
Welcome.
So, you're a slayer, huh?
|I like that in a woman.
I hope I thank you I mean, sir, um I will be of service.
Great!
Good.
It's good to be a giver.
Xander, this assassin you encountered,|what did he look like?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
I'm showering!
- Like that.
|- You and bug people, Xander.
- What's up with that?
|- This was different to Praying Mantis Lady.
He was a man of bugs,|not a man who was a bug.
The main thing is everybody's all right.
|It's apparent that we're under serious attack.
These Taraka are definitely serious.
Fortunately, so is Kendra.
I fear the worst is to come.
I've discovered|the remaining keys to Drusilla's cure.
The ritual requires her sire and it must be|in a church on the night of the new moon.
- The new moon?
But that is tonight.
|- Exactly!
I'm sure the assassins were here to kill Buffy|before she could put a stop to things.
They need Drusilla's sire.
|You mean the vamp that made her?
Yes.
Buffy, what is it?
Angel.
He's Drusilla's sire.
Man, that guy got major neck in his day!
Will this ritual kill him?
Yes, I'm afraid it will.
We need to find|where this ritual will take place.
Agreed.
We have five hours before sundown.
- Don't worry, Buffy.
We'll save Angel.
|- Angel?
But our priority is to stop Drusilla.
Angel's our friend.
Except I don't like him.
Look, you've got your priorities|and I've got mine.
Right now they mesh.
So are you gonna help me|Or are you gonna get out of my way?
I'm with you.
Good.
Cos I've had it.
Spike is going down.
You can attack me, you can send|assassins after me - that's fine.
But nobody messes with my boyfriend.
My mommy ate lemons raw.
She said she loved the way|they made her mouth tingle.
Little Anne Her favourite was custard, brandied pears.
Dru And pomegranates.
They used to make|her face and fingers all red.
Remember, hm?
Little fingers, little hands.
Do you?
- If I could|- Bite your tongue.
They used to eat cake and eggs and honey.
Until you came and ripped their throats out.
There are 43 churches in Sunnydale?
|Seems a little excessive.
It's the extra evil vibe from the Hellmouth.
|Makes people pray harder.
Check and see if any of them|are closed or abandoned.
Yeah, we got monsters, we got demons,|but no bug dude or police lady.
You'll have better luck with this one.
There's|a section devoted to the Order of Taraka.
And those two,|they also know you are the Slayer?
Yep.
Did anyone explain to you|what "secret identity" means?
Nope.
Must be in the handbook,|after the chapter on personality removal.
- Be careful with that thing.
|- Please.
I'm an expert in all weapons.
- Is everything all right?
|- Yeah, it's OK.
- Kendra killed the bad lamp.
|- Sorry!
This, uh trigger mechanism is different.
Perhaps when this is over,|you can show me how to work it.
When this is over, I'm thinking|pineapple pizza and teen video movie fest.
Possibly something|from the Ringwald oeuvre, Oh, here we go.
|I am the bug man, coo-coo ca-choo.
OK.
OK He can only be killed|when he's in his disassembled state.
Disassembled.
That means when|he's broken down into his little buggy parts.
I know what it means, dorkhead!
Dorkhead!
You slash me with your words!
Your life is very different than mine.
You mean the part where|I occasionally have one?
Yeah, I guess it is.
The things you do and have|I was taught distract from my calling.
Friends, school, - ..
even family.
|- Even family?
My parents, they sent me to my watcher|when I was very young.
- How young?
|- I don't remember them, actually.
I've seen pictures, but, uh that's how|seriously the calling is taken by my people.
My mother and father gave me to my watcher|because they believed ..
that they were doing the right thing|for me and for the world.
Please I don't feel sorry for meself.
|Why should you?
I don't know.
I I guess|it just sounds very lonely.
Emotions are weakness, Buffy.
|You shouldn't entertain them.
Kendra, my emotions give me power.
|They're total assets.
Maybe for you.
|But I prefer to keep an even mind.
Mm I guess that explains it.
- Explains what?
|- Oh, well When we were fighting You're amazing.
Your technique is flawless.
|It's better than mine.
I know.
Still I would have kicked|your butt in the end.
You know why?
- No imagination.
|- Really?
You think so?
Oh, I know so.
You're good,|but power alone isn't enough.
A good fighter needs to know|how to improvise, go with the flow Seriously, don't get me wrong.
|You do have potential.
Potential?
|I could wipe the floor with you right now.
That would be anger you're feeling.
- What?
|- You feel it, right?
How the anger gives you fire?
|A slayer needs that.
Excuse me, ladies.
Nice knife.
I guess dating isn't big|with your watcher either.
I'm not permitted to speak with boys.
Unless you're pummelling them.
- Wait a minute.
|- What?
That guy The sleazoid|you nearly decked in the bar.
- You think he might help us?
|- I think we might make him.
Say "uncle".
Oh, that's right!
You killed my uncle.
That's it, then.
Off to church.
It makes pretty colours.
I'll see him die soon enough.
|I've never been much for the pre-show.
Too bad.
That's what Drusilla likes best, as I recall.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ask her.
She knows what I mean.
- Well?
|- Sh Bad dog.
You should have let me talk to him, Dru.
Sounds like your boy|could use some pointers.
She likes to be teased.
Keep your hole shut!
Take care of her, Spike.
The way she touched me just now|I can tell when she's not satisfied.
I said shut up!
Or maybe you two|just don't have the fire we had.
That's enough.
Spike, no!
Oh Right.
Right You almost got me.
Aren't you a "throw himself to the lions"|sort of sap these days?
Well, the lions are onto you, baby.
If I kill you now, you go quick|and Dru hasn't got a chance.
And if Dru dies, ..
your little Rebecca of Sunnyhell Farm and|her mates are spared her coming-out party.
Spike, the moon is rising.
It's time.
Too bad, Angelus.
|Looks like you go the hard way.
Along with the rest of this miserable town.
- Honest!
I don't know where Angel is!
|- What about this ritual?
What do you know?
- Nothing.
It's all hush-hush.
|- Just hit him, Buffy!
She likes to hit.
You know maybe I did hear|something about this ritual.
Yeah It's coming back to me.
But, uh I'd have to take you there.
- Let's go.
|- First we must return to the Watcher.
Excuse me?
While we run to Giles,|this whole thing could go down.
- But it is procedure.
|- It's brainless, you mean!
If we don't go now, Angel could die!
Is that all you're worried about?
|Your boyfriend?
- No, it's not all, but it's enough.
|- It's as I feared.
He clouds your judgement.
|We can't stop this ritual alone.
Are you listening to me?
He could die!
He's a vampire.
He should die.
Why am I the only person who sees it?
Are you that big a fool?
Good riddance, then.
Here you go.
Don't ever say your friend Willy|don't come through in a pinch.
Here you go.
Don't ever say your friend Willy|don't come through in a pinch.
Eligor, I name thee.
Bringer of war, poisoners, ..
pariahs, grand obscenity.
Eligor, wretched master of decay, - ..
bring your black medicine.
|- Black medicine.
Come!
Restore your most impious, murderous child.
Murderous child.
From the blood of the sire she is risen.
From the blood of the sire|she shall rise again.
Right, then.
Now we just let them come to|a simmering boil, then remove to a low flame.
Payday, pal.
I got your slayer.
Are you tripping?
You bring her here now?
- You said you wanted her!
|- In the ground, pinhead!
I wanted her dead!
Word was there was a bounty on her,|dead or alive.
You heard wrong, Willy.
Angel Yeah!
It bugs me too, seeing 'em like that.
Another five minutes, though,|and Angel will be dead, so I forbear.
Don't feel too bad for Angel.
|He's got something you don't have.
- What's that?
|- Five minutes.
Patrice!
Who the hell is this?
- It's your lucky day, Spike.
|- Two slayers.
No waiting.
Hey, Larva Boy!
Yeah, that's right.
|I'm talkin' to you, you big cootie!
Welcome, my little pretties.
Switch.
- I'd rather be fightin' you anyway.
|- Mutual.
Die!
Die, die, die!
I We did it, Cordy.
Where are you going?
- Now, this isn't my fault.
|- Oh, they tricked you?
- Mm-hm.
They were duplicitous.
|- Then I'll only kill you once!
Spike!
Hold him steady!
That's me favourite shirt!
|That's me only shirt!
Look out!
Sorry, baby.
Gotta go.
I hope that was enough.
I'm good.
Hi.
- Let's get him out.
|- Careful.
Oh, hey animal cracker?
No, thank you.
- How's your arm?
|- Suddenly painless.
You can still play the guitar OK?
Well, not well, but not worse.
You know, I never really thanked you.
Ooh, no.
Please don't.
I don't do thanks.
|I get all red, have to bail.
It's not pretty.
Well then, forget that thing.
Especially with the part where|I kind of owe you my life.
Oh, look!
Monkey.
|And he has a little hat and little pants.
Yeah, I see.
The monkey's the only cookie animal|that wears clothes.
You know that?
You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen.
So, do the other cookie animals|feel sorta ripped?
Like is the hippo going "Hey, man.
Where|are my pants?
I have my hippo dignity".
And the monkey's just|"I mock you with my monkey pants"!
And then there's a big coup in the zoo.
- The monkey is French?
|- All monkeys are French.
You didn't know?
No.
We need to talk.
OK.
Here's the deal.
We don't have to run|every time we see each other in the hall.
Right.
OK.
Why shouldn't we run?
What happened|There's a total explanation for it.
- You're a pervert?
|- Me?
!
Yeah.
- I seem to recall I was the jumpee, my friend.
|- As if!
You've probably been planning this.
Right, I hired a Latvian bug man|to kill Buffy, so I could kiss you.
I hate to say this, but you don't inspire me|to spring for a dinner at Bucky's Fondue Hut!
Fine.
Whatever.
You know, the point is don't try it again.
I didn't try it!
Forget about the bugs, OK?
The memory of|your lips on mine makes my blood run cold.
- If you dare breathe a word|- Like I want anyone to know!
- Then it's erased.
|- Never happened.
- Good.
|- Good.
Good!
Thank you for the shirt.
|It was very generous of you.
Hey, it looks better on well, me, but no|worries.
Now, when you get to the airport I get on the plane with me ticket|and sit in a seat, not the cargo hold.
Very good.
- That is not travelling undercover.
|- Exactly.
Relax.
You earned it.
Sit in your seat,|you eat your peanuts, you watch the movie Well, unless it's about a dog or Chevy Chase.
I'll remember.
I, um I just wanted to thank you|for helping me save Angel.
I'm not telling me watcher about that.
|It is too strange that a slayer loves a vampire.
- Tell me about it.
|- Still, he is pretty cute.
Well, maybe they won't fire me|for dating him.
- You always do that.
|- Do what?
You talk about slaying like it's a job.
It's not.
It's who you are.
Did you get that from your handbook?
From you.
I guess it's something|I really can't fight.
I'm a freak.
Not the only freak.
Not any more.
I don't hug.
Right.
No.
Good.
Hate hugs.
Don't worry, dear heart.
I'll see that you get strong again.
Like me.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
In every generation there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, - You don't know what you're talking about.
|- Xander, he was in charge.
He was a puppet.
She was using him.
He didn't seem like the type of guy|who would let himself be used.
That was her genius!
He didn't know|he was playing second fiddle.
Buffy Who was the real power,|the Captain or Tennille?
Um, who are these people?
The Captain and Tennille?
!
Somebody was raised|in a culture-free environment!
- I'm sorry!
I was just|- Thinkin'?
No, not thinking.
|Having a lot of happy not-thoughts.
I love it when things are quiet around here.
With Spike and Drusilla out of the way,|we've really been ridin' the mellow!
And I am really jinxin'|the hell out of us by sayin' that.
Yeah, but we'll let you off this time.
So, we're pretty sure there are no more|Tarakan assassins coming our way?
- Angel's sources say the contract's off.
|- How is Angel?
- Pretend I care.
|- Getting better.
- You're loving playing nursemaid?
|- Oh, yeah.
- Better than playing naughty stewardess?
|- Xander!
You guys wait here a second.
No!
Mom!
I'm sorry.
I heard Uh, I broke a wine glass.
- You're home early.
|- Hi.
Hi.
Oh, this is my daughter Buffy.
Buffy, this is Ted.
OK, here we go!
So, these late nights at the gallery recently.
|I gather you were cataloguing more than art.
Well, I've been looking for the right moment|to introduce you two.
He's a wonderful man.
How'd you meet?
He sells computer software.
|He redid my system at the gallery.
- Freed up a lot of my time.
|- To meet new people.
- And smooch them in my kitchen.
|- You weren't supposed to see that.
- I like my new nine-gig hard drive.
|- But you don't love it.
Without the DMA upgrade,|it's only half a rocket ship.
- Yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?
|- You can.
I get the demos for free.
I can give them|to you.
Any friend of Buffy's What?
It's the sound she makes|when she's speechless with geeker-joy.
This is the finest pizza on God's|green earth.
What is your secret?
After you bake it, you fry it in herbs and|olive oil, but you gotta use a cast-iron skillet.
- No room for compromise there.
|- You should market these things.
You can get 200-300 bucks apiece!
- Hungry?
|- No, thanks.
Buffy, I want to apologise.
|That wasn't how I wanted us to meet.
I wanted it to be perfect.
I'm very fond of your mother.
|I guess that's pretty obvious.
I know you're the most|important thing in her life and Well, gosh, that makes you|pretty important to me, too.
- Buffy, I really want you to be OK with this.
|- Beg to differ.
We really want you to be OK with this.
- I'm OK.
|- You are?
I am!
Buffy, I believe he's, um It's staking time, really, don't you think?
- Any others?
|- For their sakes, I certainly hope not.
- What?
I kill vampires.
That's my job.
|- True, true.
You don't usually beat them|into quite such a pulp beforehand.
- Everything all right?
|- Yeah.
Fine.
I killed one here on Wednesday.
|Why are they in the park?
They're scattered, you know?
|Their leaders are gone, with any luck dead.
In times of crisis,|they return to the easiest feeding grounds.
Vampires are creeps.
Yes, that's why one slays them.
People are perfectly happy|getting along, then vampires come.
They run around and kill people and take over|your house and make stupid mini-pizzas Uh, Buffy I believe the subtext here|is rapidly becoming a a text.
- Sure there's nothing you want to share?
|- No.
Forget it.
Think there'll be any more?
I can wait.
- If you say one more word, things'll get dire.
|- Did you even bother to taste 'em?
No!
Well, I did.
And I'm here to tell ya,|those mini-pizzas have changed my life.
Ted is the master chef.
Fine.
He's a good cook.
|What does that really tell you?
- Everything.
|- You don't like him.
I don't know him.
So far all I see is|someone who apparently has a good job, ..
seems nice and polite,|and my mother likes him.
What kind of a monster is he?
There's something|too clean about this clown.
He's a clean clown!
- I have my own fun.
|- Buff, you're lacking evidence.
- I think we're in Sigmund Freud territory.
|- He has a point.
Separation anxiety, the mother figure taken|away, conflict with the father figure - He's not my father figure.
|- Having issues much?
- I am not!
|- # You're having parental issues!
- # You're having parental issues!
|- Xander Freud would have said the exact same thing.
- He might not have done that little dance.
|- OK, I admit it's weird.
Seeing my mother Frenching a guy is a|ticket to therapy-land, but it's more than that.
I'm good at sensing things and|there is something wrong with this Ted.
- Ted!
|- Of course.
Who'd you think I meant?
- Hi, Ted Ted who's here.
|- Hello, kids.
- What are you doing here?
|- Updating the software.
Which reminds me.
Your upgrades.
- Oh, what a day!
Thank you.
|- Think nothing of it.
- Buffy, do you like miniature golf?
|- Who doesn't?
Your mother and I thought this Saturday|we'd drag the three of you to the course, ..
spend time swinging the iron|with the stuffy old people.
- Well|- I'm making a picnic basket.
- With mini-pizzas?
|- And cookies.
You know what?
We would love to, but|unfortunately we have that thing on Saturday.
Oh, that thing!
That thing, Hey, we can do that thing any time.
|I'm tired of doin' that thing.
We're on.
Great!
Hello, Jenny.
Rupert.
Hi.
Some of your textbooks|were delivered to the library.
Do you want me to hang on to them?
Yeah, that's fine.
|I'll send the kids by to pick 'em up.
Right.
Good.
Pretty flimsy excuse for comin' by to see me.
You should have heard the ones I threw out!
Well, I just wanted to|see how you were doing.
I'm doin' pretty good, actually.
I've stayed out of mortal danger|for three whole weeks.
I could get used to it.
I'm still having trouble sleeping, though.
Of course.
Um, you need time.
Or possibly space.
|Rupert, I know you're concerned.
But having you constantly pokin' around,|makin' puppy-dog eyes, askin' if I'm OK You make me feel bad that I don't feel better.
I don't want that responsibility.
I'm sorry.
I certainly don't mean to make ..
dog eyes at you.
- I'm just|- Worried.
I know.
I shouldn't have bothered you.
Mom's like "Will Ted like this?
|Ted's teachin' me computers".
"Ted said" And I'm like "Great, Mom".
|She said I was being sarcastic.
- I'm sorry if I don't talk about Ted all day!
|- So you're gonna talk about somethin' else?
I'm sorry.
I just have so much to deal with.
|I don't need some new guy in my life.
No?
Maybe your mom does.
Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom!
Loneliness is about|the scariest thing there is.
OK, so my mom needs a guy in her life.
- Does it have to be Ted?
|- You have somebody else in mind?
There's a guy out there|that would satisfy you?
My dad.
Yeah, OK, that's not gonna happen.
Fine, fine.
I'll give Ted a chance.
I'll play minigolf and I'll smile and|curtsey and be the dutiful daughter.
Do I have to like him?
- Kiss me.
|- Finally something I wanna do!
Ah!
The dreaded five-par cuckoo clock!
Ha!
So many have come,|so few have conquered.
That picnic was delicious!
|It's rare to find a man that cooks.
I know.
I've been looking a long time for one!
Buffy, I bet the boys are lined up around|the block trying to get a date with you.
- Not really.
|- Oh, they are, but she's only interested in Uh, her studies!
Book-cracker Buffy.
It's kind of her nickname.
I'm glad to hear it.
I bet that means|your grades will be picking up soon.
My grades?
- How does he know about my grades?
|- I told him.
He wants to know everything about you.
|He's concerned.
That's a good thing.
Ooh, nice shot, Ted!
Keep your eye on the ball.
|Watch those elbows!
Oh, bad luck, little lady!
- Oh, we won't count it.
|- We won't?
- It's just miniature golf.
|- It is, but the rules are the rules.
What we teach her is what she takes|into the world when we're not there, ..
whether it's at school|or an unchaperoned party.
I won't overstep my bounds.
|It's between you and your mother.
I just think right is right.
He has a point.
Fine.
I'll just go hit my ball from the rough.
Hey, how about that?
Got a hole in two!
Beg to differ.
OK, so fine my score or whatever.
I think you're missing the point here,|little lady.
Right is right.
Wrong is wrong.
|Why don't people see that?
- It's just a game?
|- Right, it's just a game, do your own thing.
Well, I'm not wired that way.
|And I'm here to tell you ..
it is not a game, it does count, and I don't|stand for that kind of malarkey in my house!
Then it's a good thing I'm not in your house.
Do you want me to slap|that smart-ass mouth of yours?
Who's up for dessert?
|I made chocolate-chip cookies!
- Yummy!
|- Cookies!
Yeah, I made too many, so you guys|are gonna have to take some home.
Mm!
Buffy, you've got to try one of these.
|They're really good.
Mm!
These are tasty!
- Good morning, sunshine.
|- Hey.
I've got juice, I've got sticky buns.
|Don't they smell good?
Ted made them.
What?
I'd just like to eat something|that Ted didn't make.
- What kind of an attitude is that?
|- I know you think he's great He went out of his way to be nice and you|couldn't say two words to him on Saturday.
I do not expect you to love him right away|like I do, but I want you to treat him decently.
You love him?
I don't know.
That just slipped out But I guess.
- It's not like men beat down the door|- ..
when you're a single parent.
I wouldn't have anything to do with anybody|who didn't care about you, but he does.
I don't understand why you can't see that.
- He threatened me.
|- What?
He threatened me.
|He said that he was gonna slap my face.
He said no such thing.
|Honey, Ted told me what happened.
- He caught you cheating, didn't he?
|- Yeah, I kicked my ball in.
Put me in jail.
- But he totally wigged.
|- Did he say anything in front of the others?
- No, but I don't think that's|- I thought that was pretty decent of him.
Ted said we have to|give you time to come round.
Speaking of which, he's making dinner for us|tonight, so I'd like you home promptly at six.
Mm!
This is so delicious!
Check him out?
Investigate him.
Find out his secrets.
- Can you say "overreaction"?
|- Can you say "sucking chest wound"?
Buffy, it just seems like you|want him to be corrupt or something.
- The guy lost his senses over minigolf.
|- Being a little uptight isn't a slaying offence.
Don't give me the look.
I'm on your side.
|But some things you have to accept.
And Ted ain't one of 'em.
- Hey, Cordy, nice outfit!
|- Oh, very funny.
- Not really.
|- What are you saying?
- Nice outfit?
|- Why don't you just keep your mouth shut?
Would you guys excuse me for a sec?
What's up with them?
- What's wrong?
|- I gave you a compliment.
- In front of your friends.
They'll know.
|- Know what?
Please!
It's too traumatic|for me to even say it!
That we kissed?
I'm not gonna tell.
They're not gonna know.
|Not your friends, not my friends.
- Wanna go to the utility room and make out?
|- God, is that all you ever think about?
OK.
Well, I'm not wrong here.
Ted has a problem|with me.
He acts like I'm in the way.
- Mom's been different since he was around.
|- Different like happy?
- Like Stepford.
Will you help me?
|- You know I will.
- What do you want me to look for?
|- Let's start small.
Find out where he works.
Yeah, it's a terrific product.
|No PC should be without it.
No, Mrs Lansdale,|it is not an inexpensive piece of software.
As a matter of fact,|it's a very expensive one, ..
which removes the risk|of crashing your system.
Of course, if you prefer something cheap,|I can always recommend Trust me, you won't be sorry.
|Thank you very much.
Goin' to lunch!
You're new, aren't ya?
I'm Neal.
I'm B Linda.
Belinda.
I'm just temping for the day.
Wow!
That guy's a salesman.
|He's the one to beat around here.
Nobody beats the Machine.
|The guy is a genius.
Knows everything about computers,|never loses a client.
If I sound bitter, I am.
Nobody likes an overachiever.
He's probably|got ex-wives and families to support.
He's just got a girlfriend.
|I'm amazed he let her clutter his desk.
Thank God he's takin' off for the wedding.
- The wedding?
|- He's got it set for two months from now.
Believe me, I am counting the days.
Uh-oh, the Über-Boss.
Back to the salt mines.
We thank you for what|we are about to receive, ..
and we ask that you bless this house and|help the people in it to be more productive, ..
more considerate and more honest.
- Amen.
|- Amen.
Well, another great day at work.
How was|school today, Buffy?
Did you learn anything?
- Quite a bit.
|- Good for you.
- Well, Joycie, what do you think?
|- Every home should have one of you.
It's fantastic!
Don't you think?
- Looks good.
|- Well, little lady, ..
it's not just for looks.
|It's for building strong bodies.
Honey?
Are you two engaged?
- Goodness, no!
What gave you that idea?
|- Joycie, let me handle this.
Buffy, your mother and I are|taking it one step at a time.
And if things go the way I hope, ..
maybe someday soon|I just might ask her to tie the knot.
How would you feel about that?
It's OK to have feelings, Buffy,|and it's OK to express them.
- I'd feel like killing myself.
|- Buffy!
No, no.
I told her to be honest.
Sweetheart, you should try and|get used to me, cos you know what?
I'm not going anywhere.
- May I be excused?
|- You can go to your room, young lady.
That's where you can go.
Ted, I am so embarrassed.
|I don't know what's wrong with her.
Joycie, you don't get to be salesman of the|year by giving up after a couple of rejections.
She'll come round.
Vampires!
Here, vampires!
- What are you doing in here?
|- Your mother told you to go to your room.
She didn't mean climb out|a window and go gallivanting.
First of all, this is my room.
Second - Have you been through my things?
|- Yes, I have.
That's personal.
How dare you!
I don't see how it's different from|you snooping around my office.
What exactly is a "vampire slayer"?
- It's none of your business.
|- Beg to differ, little lady.
Everything you do is nothing|but my business from now on.
- I think you'd better get out of here.
Now!
|- Or what?
You'll slay me?
I'm real.
I'm not some goblin|you made up in your little diary.
Psychiatrists have a word|for something like this: delusional.
So from now on you'll do what I say|when I say, or I show this to your mother.
And you'll spend your best|dating years inside a mental institution.
Your mother and I are going to be happy.
|You're not going to stand in the way.
Sleep tight.
That's mine, and you are not|leaving this room with it.
- Take your hand off me.
|- No.
I was so hoping you'd do that.
Buffy, stop that!
Stop it!
Ted Ted!
Ted!
You killed him!
Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein.
Sorry, but I need to ask you a few questions.
Your relationship with the deceased?
- We were, um, seeing each other.
|- Can you tell me what happened?
He fell.
Down the stairs.
He fell.
I see.
Did he slip?
|Do you know what made him fall?
I hit him.
I hit him.
He was in my room|and we got into an argument.
About what?
He Was this the first time that|you two had had an argument?
No.
He threatened me.
|He said that he would slap me.
- That was tonight?
|- No.
But he had my diary, and I tried to|take it back, and that's when he hit me.
Where?
It doesn't look like he hit you very hard.
- I don't bruise easily.
|- You've been hit before?
- Yes.
|- But Ted never hit you?
- I told you|- Before tonight?
- Ted never hit you before tonight?
|- What do you want?
- I told you what happened.
I didn't mean to.
|- I believe you.
Things got out of hand.
He's a big guy.
- Are you charging her?
|- We're not bringing anything against her yet.
She says Mr Buchanan struck her.
If it's true Anyway, we've gotta examine it further.
Right now you should take her home and|the two of you should try and get some rest.
Buffy!
- Are you OK?
|- How come you're here?
I couldn't stay at home.
|Mom won't even look at me.
What happened?
|Unless you don't wanna talk about it.
We had a fight and I lost my temper.
|Really let him have it.
The paper said he fell.
He fell.
Hard.
- What was he?
|- What?
What was he?
A demon?
A giant bug?
A dark|god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine?
I mean,|we are talking creature feature here, right?
- Oh, man.
|- I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
He started it.
Yeah that defence only works|in six-year-old court, Will.
Court?
|Are they charging you with something?
I don't know.
Not yet.
He was a person and I killed him.
- Don't say that.
|- Why not?
Everyone else is.
- And it's the truth.
|- It was an accident.
I'm the Slayer.
|I had no right to hit him like that.
Look, Buffy, I don't know|what happened exactly, but I do know you.
I know you would never hurt|anyone intentionally.
Unless Unless they were dating my mother?
I gotta go.
Buffy!
Are you all right?
Stupid question.
I'm sorry.
|If there's anything you need, just ask.
What's going on?
Oh, you needn't worry about them.
They're|just asking a few questions.
Your behaviour Um, I Of course, I told them you, uh Man, this is killin' me!
That bastard was up to|somethin'.
If I could get my hands on him - ..
earlier this week|- I thought you liked him.
I sometimes like things|that are not good for me.
Besides, no way does Buffy put|the big hurt on an innocent man.
- Nice Uncle Ted was dirty.
|- We've gotta prove that somehow.
- Xander, do you have a pen?
|- If Buffy is jailed because of that creep, ..
I'm gonna lose it.
He's gotta be in there.
A history of domestic violence,|a criminal record Ooh!
Cookies!
- Buffy's the Slayer.
Shouldn't she have|- What, a licence to kill?
Not for fun, but she's like this superman.
|Shouldn't she have different rules?
- Sure, in a fascist society.
|- Right!
Why can't we have one of those?
- Buffy's not going to jail.
It's not fair.
|- Whatever the authorities have planned, ..
it can't be much worse than what she's|doing to herself.
She's taken a human life.
The guilt is pretty hard to bear.
|It won't go away soon.
You should know, since you helped|raise that demon that killed a guy.
Yes.
Do let's bring that up|as often as possible.
So, Giles, you takin' over tonight?
Buffy's not in any shape to patrol.
The least|I can do is pick up the slack.
Someone has to.
- You shouldn't go out without the Slayer.
|- Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, - ..
there is no Slayer.
|- If you need help No, Buffy needs your help more than I.|Cary on investigating.
Find out as much about|this Buchanan chap as possible.
Be careful.
I will.
Ted's got no criminal record.
|Damn, this guy's like citizen of the year!
Don't sweat it.
It'll be fine.
- Don't sweat it?
|- Yeah, cute buddy!
We'll work it out.
No worries.
- What happened to "this is killing me"?
|- Worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.
Can I help?
It's done.
I've been meaning to|clean out this junk for months.
Do you have homework?
- I didn't mean to hurt him.
|- I don't wanna talk about this.
- Mom, please, you have to know|- I can't.
Not yet.
Please, Buffy, just go to your room.
- OK|- What do we know?
Well, apparently the secret|ingredient is not love.
- What is it?
|- I'm not positive, but I think it's dekfatorin.
It's like a tranquilliser.
|Keeps you all mellow and compliant.
It also shares a few|components with ecstasy.
This is evidence!
This is real evidence|that Ted was some kind of crook.
Buffy's cleared.
Willow,|you are the best human ever, I adore you!
That's the cookies talkin', but you rock!
Your search finally hit pay dirt.
I got personal records,|marriage certificates, and an address.
Well, let's check it out.
Get our Slayer back|on her feet before somebody else gets hurt.
- I get that reaction from men all the time!
|- Jenny, what are you doing here?
I saw your car.
I wanted to apologise.
- Now's not the best time|- No, please, let me just get this out.
I was so harsh the other day.
I am so sorry.
I mean, I know how badly you must feel|about putting me in danger before.
Imagine how I must feel now.
Mom?
To hell with this!
She nailed it shut.
Well, it's official.
|This day can't get any worse.
Beg to differ.
- You died.
|- That's right, little lady.
You killed me.
Do we have something to say about that?
|Are we sorry?
- What are you?
|- I'm a salesman.
That's what you should have remembered.
|No matter how you put him down, ..
a good salesman always bounces back.
My bow!
See, I had to shut down for a while|to get you off my back.
You should have seen the intern's face when|I got up.
It was a hoot!
Fun's over, though.
Say good night, big guy!
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
Nice shot, lady!
That wasn't playin' fair, missy!
You're gonna find Hell of a day!
|Makes you feel like you're 18 again!
..
that I don't like being disobeyed!
Don't worry about me and your mother.
|We're gonna be very happy.
Careful!
Let's look around.
- I'll take the back.
|- Check for cookies.
For evidence!
So far I've counted four marriage certificates.
- Any divorce papers?
|- Not a one.
- So, either our boy was a Mormon, or|- Whoa!
1951?
Ted must have married young.
|Like, pre-school young.
Nothing interesting.
Doesn't look|like anybody works or lives here.
Something's missing here.
|This doesn't seem like Ted at all.
Yeah, and this rug,|it doesn't go with the rest of the decor.
Buffy I'm sorry.
I know you didn't mean to - Joyce?
|- Ted!
Is it really?
But you were I'm OK.
I'm OK.
I don't understand this.
You were dead!
They said I was dead for six minutes.
|Any longer would have caused brain damage.
- Why didn't they tell us?
|- Nobody knew.
In the morgue,|I was unconscious for almost a day.
An intern found me.
It's a miracle, Joyce.
- Oh, Ted!
|- I know.
Oh, my God!
Buffy!
Ted, she never meant to hurt you.
|You have to believe me.
You don't have to worry about Buffy.
|Don't worry about anything.
Daddy's here.
Feels like home|if it's the fifties and you're a psycho.
What you got in the closet, Ted?
Let's go.
- But we need evidence.
|- We got it.
- What's in there?
|- His first four wives.
You know what brought me back, Joyce?
|It was you.
I couldn't go into that light.
|I had to come back for you.
I'm gonna make you so happy.
- You should sit down.
|- I feel fine.
Never better.
Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first,|before she sees you, cos I'm sure Do we have to worry about Buffy right now?
|How about Teddy?
He's the one who died!
I'm sorry, I just - I don't know what to do.
|- Don't I always tell you what to do?
I'm going to make things right.
|Then you and I Want a little gravy with that?
..
can go away where|no one will bother us again.
Ted, I I think you might|wanna rest for a while.
You might wanna stop telling me what to do.
|I don't take orders from women.
I'm not wired that way.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
- I think I'm all right.
|- No, you're in shock.
No, really, I don't think it went in too deep.
The advantages of layers of tweed.
|It's better than Kevlar.
Oh.
OK, we have to get you to the hospital.
- Ow!
Ow!
Let's move slowly, shall we?
|- Sorry.
OK.
What?
What is it?
Some night, huh?
Hey, you really know how|to woo a girl back, don't ya?
Hospital.
I think I could use a drink.
Uh, to celebrate.
- We should probably be hitting the road.
|- Hitting the road?
You'll love the house.
It's furnished|just the way you like it.
I spent a lot of Telling me what to do!
..
time decorating.
- Well, then, I'd probably better go pack.
|- I already have your clothes.
They're your size.
They're always your size.
You left me once,|but I keep bringing you back.
Husband and wife is forever.
Forever.
- Let's go.
|- Ted, let go, please.
Get off me!
Fine, then.
I'll have to cary you.
Buffy, come out!
I don't stand for|this kind of malarkey in my house!
Uncle Teddy This house is mine, Buffy, how about a nice game of Parcheesi?
D'you wanna rent a movie tonight?
- That sounds like fun.
|- Just nothing with horror in it.
Or romance.
Or men.
- So we're Thelma and Louise-ing it again?
|- Good call.
I still think he's gonna jump out at me, ..
especially after what the police found|in his house.
It's just too horrible.
I wouldn't worry.
He's not coming back.
- I wish I could be so sure.
|- Trust me.
He's on the scrapheap.
Of life.
So I'm Ted, the sickly loser.
I'm dying|and my wife dumps me.
I build a better Ted.
He brings her back, holds her hostage|in his bunker-o-love until she dies.
And then he keeps|bringing her back over and over.
That's creepy on a level I hardly knew existed.
The sad part is, the real Ted was a genius.
|There were design features that predate Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts.
Not any big ones.
Oh, Will, you're supposed|to use your powers for good.
- But I just wanna learn stuff.
|- Like how to build your own serial killer?
- It's so hard to rent one nowadays.
|- Can we drop it?
Absolutely.
I plan to forget it all|and pick up where we left off.
OK, that's it.
I give up.
Do I have to sound|an air horn every time I walk into a room?
What is it with grown-ups these days?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, - Come on, Mom.
Please?
|- I'm sorry, honey.
- Don't you know how important this is?
|- It's an outfit.
An outfit that you may never buy.
- But I looked good in it.
|- You looked like a streetwalker.
But a thin streetwalker.
That's probably not the winning argument.
- You're just too young to wear that.
|- Too young till I'm too old to wear it.
That's the idea!
The stores are closing and I still need|to order the flyers for the opening.
OK.
I'll go to the printers,|and then get our food.
You go to the tailor and pick up my outfit|from Everyday Woman.
"Everyday Woman"?
Why didn't you|just go to Muumuus R Us?
Do now.
Make fun of your mother later.
Turn around.
I've somethin' to show ya.
Wait a sec.
This is my high score.
Well, ain't you just got|the prettiest little neck I ever did see?
Boy!
You guys really never come up|with any new lines, do you?
Do you mind?
We were talking here.
But you promised|you'd never cheat on me again, honey.
- Um I'd better go.
|- But I ain't done yet.
All right, sugar lips.
Giddyup.
Oh, you're a rough one,|ain't ya?
I like that.
You must be that slayer|I've been hearin' so much about.
Lyle Gorch.
Pleased to meet ya.
The pleasure's mine.
This ain't over.
Oh, sure.
They say they'll call Oh, bliss.
Mall food.
- Buffy?
|- Mom?
- Where's my dress?
|- Your dre - Oh Oh, God.
|- Let me guess.
- You were distracted by a boy.
|- Technically.
- Buffy!
|- Look, I can go get it right now.
They're closed.
|I'll just have to fit it in tomorrow.
- Sorry.
|- A little responsibility is all I ask.
Don't you ever think about|anything besides boys and clothes?
Saving the world from vampires?
I swear, sometimes I don't know|what goes on in your head.
Xander It's just that I'm worried|we're gonna miss class.
This would work a lot better|for me if you didn't talk.
Well, it'd work a lot better for me|with the lights off.
Are you saying that you can't look at me|when we do whatever it is we do?
No, it's not that I can't.
|It's just more I don't want to.
Great.
That's just dandy.
|We're repulsed by each other.
- We hide from our friends|- Well, I should hope so.
Please!
All in all, this is not|a big self-esteem booster.
Tell me about it.
Just look at you.
|And where did you get those shoes?
- OK.
You know what?
I don't need this.
|- Ditto.
Like a hole in the head.
S-E-X.
Sex.
The sex drive in the human animal is intense.
How many of us|have lost countless productive hours ..
plagued by unwanted|sexual thoughts and feelings?
- Yes.
|- That was a rhetorical question, Mr Harris, ..
not a poll.
Of course, for teenagers such as yourselves,|these feelings are even more overwhelming.
With all sorts of hormones surging through|your bodies, compelling you to action, ..
it's often difficult to remember that there are|negative consequences to having sex.
Would anyone care to|offer one such consequence?
That depends.
Are you talking about|sex in the car, or out of the car?
Because I have a friend - not me - that|was in a Miata parked on top of the hill I was thinking of something|more commonplace.
You wanna talk negative consequence?
|What about halitosis?
A girl may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her|flossing, the bloom is definitely off the rose.
Like that compares to kissing a guy who|thinks the Hoover technique is a big turn-on!
What about having to feign interest in|her vapid chitchat just to get some touch?
Now, another consequence|of sexual activity?
Anyone, uh, else?
How about pregnancy?
|That would be a major one, right?
Thank you.
Among teens, unwanted pregnancy is the|No.
1 negative consequence of sexual activity.
So, as discussed last week,|I present you with your offspring.
You will split into parenting teams, ..
sharing equally in the daily task|of raising your egg.
Please choose a partner|and come pick up your children.
You wanna have a baby?
Hey.
Ha-ha-ha.
I know we just met,|but isn't that Xander Junior you're holding?
Buffy, how come you weren't in class?
Vampire issues.
|Did Mr Whitmore notice I was tardy?
- The word you're searching for is "absent".
|- Tardy people show.
- Right.
|- And yes, he did notice, ..
so he wanted me to give you this.
As far as punishments go,|this is fairly abstract.
- No!
It's your baby.
|- OK, I get it even less.
It's the "sex leads to responsibility" thing,|which I don't get.
You gotta take care of the egg.
It's a baby.
|Teach it Christian values.
- My egg is Jewish.
|- Then teach it that dreidel song.
I can't do this.
I can't take care of things.
I killed my Giga Pet.
Literally.
|I sat on it and it broke.
You'll do fine.
What stresses me is,|when do we tell them they're adopted?
I'll just lay that one off|on my partner.
Who'd I get?
Well, there were an uneven number|of students, and you didn't show, so - I'm a single mother?
|- No man of her own.
Do you know what this says about me?
|That I'm doomed to lead my mother's life.
- How deeply scary is that?
|- How about this?
It says nothing, it means nothing.
|This egg experiment is completely pointless.
Success at last!
Your playmate is|a fellow of repute, it seems.
It's, erm, Lyle Gorch.
And that's|his brother, Tector.
They're from Abilene.
They made their reputation by massacring|an entire Mexican village in 1886.
- Friendly little demons.
|- That was before they became vampires.
But, erm the good news is that they're|not amongst the great thinkers of our time.
I doubt if they're up to much - just|drawn here by the Hellmouth's energy.
- I propose Buffy slays them.
All in favour?
|- Aye.
I don't think you should underestimate them.
|I mean, you may need to have some help if - Why do you all have eggs?
|- Hey, maybe you can have Angel help you.
Yes, that's not a bad idea.
|Strength in numbers.
All right.
I see a lot of hunting|getting done in that scenario.
Please.
Like Angel and I are just|helpless slaves to passion.
Grow up.
- We really|- I know.
You know, this isn't hunting|in the classical sense.
We should.
You're right.
- OK.
|- OK.
- You see anything?
|- No.
- OK Enough hunting.
|- Yeah.
- That the Slayer?
|- Yep.
- Ain't that Angelus with her?
|- Yep.
Well, how come she ain't slayin'?
|And how come he's about to make me blush?
I don't know, Tector.
And how come you're|always askin' me so many stupid questions?
So, you wanna take him,|or, uh you want me to, Lyle?
I say we leave it.
Wait till she's alone.
Why?
You scared?
No.
I could whip 'em both|right now if I wanted to.
Then why don't ya?
Cos I got me a plan.
I'm the one|that does the thinkin', remember?
Yeah.
You do the thinkin', Lyle.
|That is definitely your department.
So why don't you tell me again|why we can't kill 'em now?
OK, little egg dude.
Let's see Feeding Check.
Burping Urgh.
Check.
Diapers Sort of.
In theory, I guess.
OK.
Good night, Egbert.
I'm tired of rat.
How come|we can't stay in a nice place?
A motel or somethin'.
Maybe|maybe one with an ice machine.
Cos we got to keep a low profile till|we get this slayer business taken care of.
Well, how come Angelus is|gettin' all cuddly with her, Lyle?
I mean, does the man have no code?
Tector?
Are you gonna pester me|with questions all damn day?
I just don't like it here.
There ain't|a decent whore in the whole city limits.
So this is the thanks I get?
Well Don't I take care of ya?
|Didn't I near raise you myself?
Hm?
Maybe I shoulda left you|on that doorstep when Momma blew town.
Don't say that, Lyle.
- Now I'm takin' care of this.
|- You afraid of the girl?
I'm just playin' it safe.
We're just gonna follow her around|a little while, find our time.
- Cos this ain't over.
|- I think you are afraid of the Slayer.
All right.
I'm gonna beat you|like a redheaded stepchild.
- Throw your ass out in that sunlight.
|- You think you can?
Giddyup, son.
Ohh Oh, God.
- Eat something if you're gonna drink that.
|- Not that hungry.
- How's the parenting going?
|- Fine.
Are you sure your egg is secure in that?
Did I ask for back-seat mommying?
- Are we a little touchy this morning?
|- No.
I just feel all funky.
Hm You don't have a fever.
Oh, no, it's not that.
|I just I didn't sleep well.
What's the matter?
|Your egg keep you up all night?
You're killing me.
Parenting's a pain.
Wait till it starts dating.
Oh!
Why are you three hanging about?
- Don't you have classes to go to?
|- Teen Health got cancelled.
Mr Whitmore is ab.
He couldn't|find an egg-sitter or somethin'.
- Can you give me a hand?
|- No.
Sure.
How did the, erm hunt go last night, Buffy?
No go.
Er no, you didn't go,|or or you were unsuccessful?
No Gorches.
Buffy has decided the problem with English|is all those pesky words.
"You".
"Angel".
"Big".
"Smoochies".
Shut.
Up.
It's true, Buffy.
You and Willow|do seem a little sluggish.
- Maybe something we ate.
|- Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood.
Notice how seriously|you take this egg thing.
While I have, uh well,|chosen a more balanced approach.
- Xander!
|- That's what I'm talkin' about.
You can't stress over every little thing.
|A child picks up on that.
Which is a one-way ticket to Neurotic City.
It didn't break.
How come it didn't break?
Another secret to conscientious egg care.
|Pot of scalding water and about 8 minutes.
- You boiled your young?
|- Yeah.
Sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind.
You can bet that little Xander|is thick-skinned now.
Technically, that would be cheating, yes?
No.
It's like a shortcut.
|You know, when you run a race?
- That would also be cheating.
|- You should be ashamed.
I suppose there is a Machiavellian|ingenuity to your transgression.
I resent that!
Or possibly thank you.
It figures you three would be in the dungeon|while something major's going on.
And what would that be, Cordelia?
|Barrette Appreciation Day?
- Mr Whitmore didn't show today.
|- That news is of the past.
He's missing.
- Presumed dead.
|- Presumed by whom?
Well, me.
I think we should give him a few hours|before we give up on him.
I think we should look around.
|Don't you, Xander?
- It can wait.
|- Well, his body could fall out of a closet.
So we should check some closets|to see if he's in a closet?
You're right.
|There could be a closet.
Let's go.
You guys look for more clues.
|We'll meet back here.
- We'll get right on it.
|- Are they getting weirder?
Have you noticed the weirdness of them?
They're weird.
Should I have guilt|about not looking for Mr Whitmore?
I'd rather you conserve your strength|for hunting the Gorches.
I'll be fine by tonight.
|Maybe I'll sweep the cemetery.
- Be careful.
If you're still feeling sluggish|- No worries.
- And Angel's helping you, right?
|- He does what he can.
As much as I hate to say this,|we should really go kill bad guys.
It's late.
You should get home.
- What about the Gorches?
|- I'll hunt.
Really?
You'd do that?
It's not like I have an early day tomorrow.
True.
I still have to go home|and fill out my egg diary.
- Your what?
|- Oh, that faux parenting gig we're doing.
Like I'm really planning|to have kids anytime soon.
Maybe someday in the future,|when I'm done having a life.
But right now, kids would be|a little too much to deal with.
I wouldn't know.
I don't Well, you know, I can't.
Oh That's OK.
Um I figured there were all sorts|of things vampires can't do, ..
like work for the telephone company,|or volunteer for the Red Cross, ..
or have little vampires.
So you don't think about the future?
- No.
|- Never?
No.
You really don't care what happens|a year from now?
Five years from now?
Angel, when I look into the future, ..
all I see is you.
All I want is you.
I know the feeling.
Hello?
Is anybody in here?
- Come on, pick up.
|- Hello?
- Willow, are you OK?
|- Why shouldn't I be?
- Your egg.
Is it doing anything?
|- Doing what?
Break it.
Right now.
|Smash it with something heavy.
- Buffy, what|- My egg.
It went postal on me!
It hatched this creepy-crawly thing.
|It attacked me!
- Are you OK?
|- Yeah, I'm fine.
But your egg Is totally normal.
I put it in the fridge.
Oh Maybe it's a trap.
Something|the Gorch brothers planted for you?
Maybe.
Yeah.
Uh I'm sorry.
|I shouldn't have woken you.
Go back to sleep.
- Are you sure?
|- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm better.
I'm I'm fine.
OK.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's going on in here?
Buffy, who are you talking to at this|Why are you dressed?
Where are you going|at this hour of the night?
- Nowhere.
|- Who was that on the phone?
Um Willow.
|She wasn't feeling well today, ..
so I was calling|to make sure she was feeling better.
- You're gonna have to do better than that.
|- I had a bad dream?
No, you're about to have a bad dream -|that you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Which means no after-school socialising,|no Bronze, no nothing.
Not until I say so.
- Understand?
|- Yeah, but I think you School ends at 2:30.
|I want you to go to the library at 2:33, ..
and study until|I pick you up there at 5:30.
Understood?
- Yeah.
|- Good.
Have a nice day.
Nice bear.
Listen, is your Hey, my father brought this bear|back from Gstaad years ago.
Then trendoids start sporting them,|so I'm totally not wearing it.
Then I thought "Hey, I'm the one who|started this craze.
What am I ashamed of"?
OK, Soliloquy Girl.
|I just wanted to ask about your egg.
- My egg?
|- Yeah, your egg.
- The one Mr Whitmore gave you.
|- It's in my bear.
So your egg isn't acting odd or anything?
It isn't "acting" anything.
|It's an egg, Buffy.
It doesn't emote.
- Shanice!
Is that your real hair?
|- Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
Mm.
Cardboardy!
Sorry, Junior, but a man's gotta eat.
So was there any more|hatchling activity last night?
No.
You were probably right.
|It was just a trap the vamps set for me.
And everyone else's eggs|seem perfectly normal.
- Did you bring the thing that attacked you?
|- Yeah.
Giles wants to see it.
He's in full research mode.
OK.
Well, bring it to the science lab,|and I'll get Giles and we'll analyse it.
Great.
You know, I always say|that a day without an autopsy ..
is like a day without sunshine.
Hey.
Can I just say gyeurgh!
- I see your gyeurgh, and raise you a nyargh.
|- What is it?
We don't know what it is.
|That's why we're here.
Capeesh?
"Capeesh"?
What,|are you world traveller now?
- Hey, where's Giles?
|- He said to get started.
He'll be by as soon as possible.
So, OK.
Get started, Buffy.
|Dissect it or something.
- Me?
Why do I have to dissect it?
|- Because you're the Slayer.
- And I slayed.
My work here is done.
|- Oh, no!
I almost ate one of these things.
I fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade.
- Guys!
|- Do we even know what to look for?
How do we figure out what this thing is?
Maybe we missed its ID bracelet.
Now we know|what happened to Mr Whitmore.
- He saw this and ran away?
|- Try "best-case scenario".
It's possible that|Mr Whitmore wasn't harmed.
Maybe the offspring used him|to return to the mother bezoar.
- Yeah.
Maybe he What?
|- What's a bezo Cordy!
What Buffy?
- Hello?
|- Hello.
Oh!
Mr Giles.
Hi.
I was looking for Buffy.
|She was supposed to wait for me here.
She hasn't been in.
I've been waiting|to talk to her myself about history texts.
- That is just the last straw.
|- I'm sure she didn't mean to She never means to, but somehow|she always manages to anyway.
- Do you have children, Mr Giles?
|- Erm - Should I be whispering?
|- No!
And no, I- I haven't any children.
Although, er sometimes I feel|as though I do, working here.
They can be such a|Oh, I don't want to say "burden", but - Actually, I kind of do want to say "burden".
|- Feel free.
- Oh, they're just so irresponsible.
|- Sometimes.
"Bristow's Demon Index"?
.
|"Hell's Offspring"?
.
A hobby of mine.
But having|nothing to do with Buffy in any way.
Erm you say Buffy told you|that she'd be here - all afternoon?
Well, yes.
Is something wrong?
No.
I'm sure it's nothing.
- What was that?
|- Probably the janitor.
Hey!
Xander.
Hey!
You all right?
Last time Cordy dragged me|in here, it was a lot nicer.
- What?
|- Huh?
Nothing.
Uh, crazy talk.
Head trauma.
Tell me about it.
I'm gonna have a big bump.
Uh, I'm gonna have a peninsula here.
What What the hell's goin' on?
|Cordy and Willow?
Something to do with|the hatchlings, I'm sure of it.
What, are they possessed?
I don't know.
|But they sure wanted us out of the way.
Why not kill us?
Why, uh|why drag us in here?
Back now.
Thank you.
Ohh!
- Giles!
|- Giles!
He must be out somewhere.
- Well, he picked a hell of a time to get a life.
|- What do we do?
- Nothing till we know something about 'em.
|- Willow said something - a name.
- What was it?
|- A bozo!
- Not a bozo.
|- A bezoar.
That's it!
OK.
So now we look it up?
- In what?
|- A book?
Giles said he was gonna|try to find something And I'd say he found something.
I'd say something found him.
"Pre-prehistoric parasite.
The mother|hibernates underground, laying eggs".
"The offspring then attach themselves|to a host through neural clamping".
"Neural clamping"?
That sounds skippable.
So people are taking orders|from the momma bezoar.
- Which begs the question|- What does Momma want?
Somebody help me!
Get this thing|off me!
Get this thing off me!
Help!
- Are you OK?
|- I'm fine.
I slipped.
- I think I hear Mommy calling|- Uh-huh.
- Do we really wanna go in there?
|- We really don't.
Careful.
What are they diggin' up?
Oh, boy.
- We can't let them spread those eggs.
|- I'll handle it.
Can you hold down the fort?
I'm gonna need a weapon.
|I'm gonna need a big weapon.
Yeah.
- I told you this weren't over.
|- She's so cute, and little.
- D'you think we can keep her?
|- Guys, this really isn't a great time.
Oh, it's gonna be.
Hey!
That's my brother!
What the hell is this?
Mom?
Kill them.
What the hell is goin' on?
Long story.
Cordelia!
I don't want to hurt you|some of the time.
That's my bump!
Well, all right!
Well, lookee there!
Well, hello.
Tector!
Tector?
- This is all your fault.
|- How?
All right.
It's over.
Yes it was a a gas leak, everyone.
But just, er get some air|and, er a good night's rest, you know.
You'll be fine.
These gas things will happen.
- What was it really?
|- Stick with gas.
I'll fill you in tomorrow.
Right.
How you guys doin'?
- Did I really hit you?
|- You knocked me out.
- Did I hit you?
|- Yes!
Everyone hit me.
Good.
Well, I don't mean good because|I hit you, but I didn't want to be left out.
- How is she?
|- A bit confused, but it's goin' around.
- Are you OK?
|- Buffy, I was worried.
There was a gas leak.
Yeah, I just heard.
I was in the gym.
- I went looking for you in the library.
|- I was on my way there when I thought I made it clear that|you weren't to leave the library till I came.
- The other side of that is|- I'm not really interested in the other side.
Young lady, you have to learn|some responsibility, OK?
Once and for all.
- I'm grounded?
|- You're already grounded!
Until further notice,|you are confined to your room.
You will not leave your room at any time|except to go to school or the bathroom.
- Am I making myself clear?
|- You're clear.
I won't leave my room.
You're damn right, you won't.
- You sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
|- Hey.
I earned this.
Besides, I'm not breaking any rules.
Buffy?
Are you going to bed?
In a minute.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
# Lyin' down, givin' in to you Le hippo a piqué ton pantalon, # I'm a hurricane # I can't describe this feelin' - Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
|- What?
# Now that I've found this love # I'm a fire # Burnin' like a house aflame # I am motionless # I cannot move # I only see you fly # Now that I've found Angel!
Happy birthday, Buffy.
Hold on.
Hey.
Is everything OK?
That's what I was gonna ask you,|You're OK, right?
Sure I'm fine.
What's up?
I had this dream that Drusilla was alive.
What happened?
- She killed you.
Right in front of me.
|- It was just a dream.
It wasn't real.
- But it felt so real.
|- It wasn't.
I'm right here.
Angel, this happened before.
The dreams|I had about the Master.
They came true.
Still, not every dream you have comes true.
I mean, what else did you dream last night?
|Can you remember?
I dreamt I dreamt that Giles and I opened|an office-supply warehouse in Vegas.
You see my point?
Yeah, I do, but what if Drusilla is alive?
- We never saw her body.
|- She's not.
But even if she was, we'd deal.
But what if she's What if what?
I'm sorry.
Were we talking?
I'm sorry.
I um I have to go to school.
I know.
God, you feel You have to go to school.
All right.
I know.
This is me.
I'm going.
You still haven't told me|what you wanted for your birthday.
- Surprise me.
|- OK.
I will.
This is nice.
- I like seeing you first thing in the morning.
|- It's bedtime for me.
Well, then, I like seeing you at bedtime.
Um Um Y-You know what I mean.
I think so.
What do you mean?
I like seeing you.
And the part at the end of the night|where we say goodbye?
It's getting harder.
Yeah It is.
"I like you at bedtime"?
|You actually said that?
- I know.
I know.
|- Man, that's like I don't know.
- That's moxie or somethin'.
|- Totally unplanned.
It just came out.
And he was into it?
|He wants to see you at bedtime too?
Yeah, I-I think he does.
|I mean, he's cool about it.
Well, of course he is.
Cos he's cool.
I mean, he would never, you know - Push.
|- Right.
He's not the type.
- Willow, what am I gonna do?
|- What do you wanna do?
I don't know.
I I mean,|"want" isn't always the right thing to do.
To act on want can be wrong.
- True.
|- But to not act on want - What if I never feel this way again?
|- Carpe diem, You told me that once.
- "Fish of the day"?
|- Not "carp".
Carpe, It means "seize the day".
Right.
I I think we're going to.
Seize it.
Once you get to a certain point,|then seizing is sort of inevitable.
- Wow.
|- Yeah.
Wow.
Wow!
- Wow.
|- Yeah.
Hey, speaking of "wow" potential,|there's Oz over there.
Any sparkage?
He's nice Hey, I like his hands.
Mm.
A fixation on insignificant detail|is a definite crush sign.
Well, I don't know, though.
|I mean, he is a senior.
You think he's too old cos he's a senior?
|Please!
My boyfriend had a bicentennial.
That's true.
Uh I guess I just Don't spend your life waiting|for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie.
Make a move.
Do the talking thing.
What if the talking thing becomes|the awkward silence thing?
Well, you won't know until you try.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
- Do you guys uh have a gig tonight?
|- Oh.
No.
Practice.
See, our band's kinda movin' towards|this new sound where we suck, so practice.
- I think you guys sound good.
|- Thanks.
I bet you have a lot of groupies.
It happens I'm livin'|groupie-free nowadays.
I'm clean.
I'm gonna ask you|to go out with me tomorrow night.
And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually.
|It's interesting.
Oh.
Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes.
Yeah, it helps.
It It creates a comfort zone.
- Wanna go out with me tomorrow night?
|- Oh!
I can't.
See, I like that you're unpredictable.
It's Buffy's birthday,|and we're throwing her a surprise party.
- That's OK.
|- But you could come.
If you wanted.
- Well, I don't wanna crash.
|- No, it's fine.
You could be my date.
All right.
I'm in.
I said "date"!
.
So, Buffy's party.
Mañana, Just because she's "Miss Save the World",|we have to make a big deal?
I have to cook!
- You're cooking?
|- I'm chips-and-dips girl.
- Horrors!
All that opening and stirring.
|- And shopping and carrying.
You need a person who does|such things for you.
That's what I've been saying|to my father, but does he listen?
Um So Uh You're going, and and and I'm going.
- Should we maybe go?
|- Why?
This thing with us, despite|our better judgement, keeps happening.
- Maybe we should just admit we're dating.
|- Groping in a closet isn't dating.
- It's not a date until the guy spends money.
|- Fine.
I spend, we grope.
Whatever.
I just think it's some kind of wack|that we have to hide from our friends.
Of course you do.
|You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I have everything to be ashamed of.
|- You know what?
Enough said.
Must have been my|multiple-personality guy talking.
I call him Idiot Jed, glutton for punishment.
Oh, good morning.
|Is everything in order for the party?
Absolutely.
You ready to get down,|you funky party weasel?
Here comes Buffy.
|Discretion is the better part of valour.
You could have just said "Sh".
God!
|Are all you Brits such drama queens?
Buffy!
I feel a pre-birthday|spankin' comin' on.
- I'd curb that impulse if I were you, Xander.
|- Check.
Cancel spanking.
- You all right, Buffy?
You seem fatigued.
|- Rough night.
I had a dream that Drusilla was alive,|and she killed Angel.
It just really freaked me out.
- Do you feel it was more of a a portent?
|- I don't know.
- I don't want a big freak-out over nothing.
|- Still, best to be uh on the alert.
If Drusilla is alive, then it could be|a fairly cataclysmic state of affairs.
Again, so many words.
Couldn't you|just say "we'd be in trouble"?
- Go to class, Xander.
|- Gone.
Notice the economy of phrasing.
|"Gone".
It's simple.
Direct.
- Maybe I should get gone, too.
|- Don't worry unduly.
I'm sure it's nothing.
I know.
I should keep my slayer cool, but It's Angel,|which automatically equals maxi-wig.
I have your package.
Just put it on the table,|near the other gifts.
Are you dead set on this, pet?
Wouldn't you rather|have your party in Vienna?
But the invitations are sent.
Yeah But it's just|I've had it with this place.
- Nothing comes off like it's supposed to.
|- My gatherings are always perfect, Remember Spain?
Hey?
The bulls?
I remember, sweet.
But Sunnydale's cursed for us.
|Angel and the Slayer see to that.
Shh!
I've got good games for everyone.
You'll see.
These flowers are wrong.
They're all wrong.
I can't abide them!
Let's try something different|with the flowers, then.
Can I open one?
Can I?
Can I?
Just a peek, love.
They're for the party.
Do you like it, baby?
It reeks of death.
This will be the best party ever.
Why's that?
Because ..
it will be the last.
Mall trip for your birthday|on Saturday.
Don't forget.
Space on a Mom-sponsored|shopping opportunity?
Not likely.
- So, does 17 feel any different than 16?
|- It's funny you should ask that.
I woke up feeling more responsible,|mature and level-headed.
Really?
That's uncanny.
I now possess the qualities|one looks for in a licensed driver.
- Buffy|- You said we'd talk about it when I was 17.
Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
"Jenny Calendar".
- You startled me.
|- You look well.
Yes, I'm fine.
I know I haven't written as much lately.
|I've been busy.
I cannot imagine what is so important ..
to make you ignore|the responsibility to your people.
- Well, I've been working.
And|- The elder woman has been reading signs.
- Something is different.
|- Nothing has changed.
The curse still holds.
The elder woman is never wrong.
She says his pain is lessening.
She can feel it.
- There is|- There is what?
- A girl.
|- What?
!
How could you let this happen?
I promise you, Angel still suffers.
And he makes amends for his evil.
|He even saved my life.
So you just forget that he destroyed|the most beloved daughter of your tribe?
That he killed every man,|Woman and child that touched her life?
Vengeance demands that|his pain be eternal, as ours is!
If this this girl gives him one minute|of happiness, it is one minute too much!
- I'm sorry.
I thought|- Thought what?
You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?
You are still Janna, of the Kalderash people.
- A gypsy.
|- I know Uncle.
I know.
Then prove it.
Your time for watching is past.
The girl and him, it ends now, Do what you must to take her from him.
I will see to it.
And then my mom broke the plate.
It was just like my dream.
Every gesture,|every word.
It was so creepy.
Yes, well, I'd imagine|it would be fairly unnerving.
Hey!
It's the woman of the hour.
It's happy birthday, Buffy!
It's not happy birthday, Buffy?
It's just that um part of the nightmare|that Buffy had actually transpired.
Which means Drusilla might still be alive.
In my dream, she blindsided me.
Angel|was gone before I knew what happened.
Even if she is alive, we can still protect|Angel.
Dreams aren't prophecies, Buffy.
You dreamt that the Master had risen,|but you stopped it from happening.
- You ground his bones to make your bread.
|- That's true.
Except for the bread part.
OK, we're one step ahead.
|I wanna stay that way.
Absolutely.
Let me read up on Drusilla,|see if she has any particular patterns.
Why don't you meet me here at seven?
|We'll map out a strategy.
- What am I supposed to do until then?
|- Go to classes.
Do homework.
Have supper?
Right Be that Buffy.
Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy.
So much for our surprise party.
|I bought little hats and everything.
Oh, well.
I guess I'll tell Cordelia.
No, you won't.
We're having a party tonight.
Looks like Mr Caution Man,|but the sound he makes is funny.
Buffy's party will go ahead as we planned.
|Except I won't be wearing a little hat.
- But Buffy and Angel|- May well be in danger.
As they have been before,|and I imagine will be again.
One thing I've learnt here on the Hellmouth|is that there is no good time to relax.
Buffy's turning 17 just once,|and she deserves a party.
You're a great man of our time.
And anyway, Angel's coming, so she'll|be able to protect him and have cake.
Precisely.
- Buffy.
|- Oh, my God!
I didn't see you there.
Sorry.
Um Giles wanted me to tell you|there's been a change of plans.
He wants to meet you|someplace near his house.
I guess he had to get a book or something.
Cos heaven knows there aren't|enough books in the library.
- Uh He's very thorough.
|- Oh, which is not to brag.
It's kind of manly|in an obsessive-compulsive kind of way.
Mm-hm.
Um You know, my car's here.
|Why don't I drive you?
OK.
- Are we going to the Bronze?
|- I'm not sure.
Giles gave me an address.
|I'm just following his directions.
This looks funky.
Stop for a sec.
- No, Buffy.
Maybe you shouldn't.
|- Sorry.
Sacred duty, yada-yada-yada.
What is this?
Every time I see you,|you're stealing something.
You should speak with someone|about this klepto issue.
- Where is she?
|- Shh!
I think I hear her coming.
Surprise!
That pretty much sums it up.
- Buffy, are you OK?
|- Yes, what happened?
Uh There were these vamps outs|What's going on?
Oh.
Erm Surprise party.
Happy birthday.
You guys did all this for me?
- That is so sweet.
|- Are you sure you're OK?
Yes, I'm fine.
Are you OK?
Yeah Hey, did everybody|see that guy just turn to dust?
Uh Well, uh sort of.
Yep.
Vampires are real.
|A lot of 'em live in Sunnydale.
Willow will fill you in.
- I know it's hard to accept at first.
|- Actually, it explains a lot.
Hey, would somebody give me a hand here?
- Those creeps left this behind.
|- What is it?
I've no idea.
C-Can it be opened?
Yeah.
There's a secure release right here.
The Hellmouth's answer to "What do|you get the slayer who has everything"?
- Good heavens.
Buffy, are you all right?
|- Man, that thing had major grip.
- What was that?
|- It looked like an arm.
It can't be.
She wouldn't.
What, a vamp's version of snakes in a can,|or do you care to share?
- Angel?
|- It's a legend, way before my time.
Of a demon brought forth|to rid the Earth of the plague of humanity.
To separate the righteous from the wicked,|and to burn the righteous down.
- They called him the Judge.
|- The Judge?
This is he?
- Not all of him.
|- I'm still needing backstory here.
Erm He He couldn't be killed, yes?
Erm An army was sent against him.
Most of them died.
But finally they were|able to dismember him, but not kill him.
The pieces were scattered,|buried in every corner of the Earth.
- So all these parts are being brought here?
|- By Drusilla.
- The vamps outside were Spike's men.
|- She's crazy enough to do it.
- Do what?
Reassemble the Judge?
|- Bring forth Armageddon.
- Is anybody else gonna have cake?
|- We need to get this out of town.
- Angel.
|- What?
You're the only one|that can protect this thing.
- What about me?
|- You're gonna skip town for a few months?
- I gotta get to the remotest region possible.
|- But that's not months.
I can catch a cargo ship to Asia You know, flying machines|are safer than they used to be.
I can't fly.
There's no sure way|to guard against the daylight.
I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy.
But there's no other choice.
When?
Tonight.
As soon as possible.
But it's my birthday.
I'll drive you to the docks.
You lost it.
You lost my present.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's a bad turn, man.
|She can't have her fun without the box.
The Slayer.
She came out of nowhere.
|I didn't even see her.
She - Make a wish.
|- What?
I'm going to blow out the candles.
You might give him a chance|to find your lost treasure.
He is a wanker, but he's|the only one we've got with half a brain.
If he fails, you can eat his eyes|out of the sockets for all I care.
I'll get it.
Please.
I swear.
OK.
Hurry back, then.
I should go the rest of the way alone.
OK.
But I'll be back.
I will.
When?
Six months?
A year?
You don't know how long it's gonna take,|or if we'll even Hey If we'll even what?
Well, if you haven't noticed,|someone pretty much always wants us dead.
Don't say that.
We'll be fine.
We don't know that.
We can't know, Buffy.
|Nobody can.
That's just the deal.
I have somethin' for you.
For your birthday.
I was gonna give it to you earlier, but It's beautiful.
My people Before I was changed,|they exchanged this as a sign of devotion.
It's a Claddagh ring.
The hands represent friendship,|the crown represents loyalty.
And the heart Well, you know.
Wear it with the heart pointing towards you.
|It means you belong to somebody.
Like this.
Put it on.
- I don't wanna do this.
|- Me either.
So don't go.
Buffy?
I Angel!
The box!
You Buffy!
They should be back by now.
Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes|to pull herself together.
Poor Buffy.
On her birthday and everything.
It's sad, granted.
But let's look|at the upside for a moment.
What kind of future|would she have really had?
She's got two jobs.
|Waitress by day, slayer by night.
Angel's in front of the TV with a big|blood belly, dreamin' of the glory days ..
when Buffy thought this creature-|of-the-night routine was a turn-on.
- You've thought too much about this.
|- That's just the start.
Have I told you the part where I fly into town|in my jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?
And she cries?
What happened?
- Dru's guys ambushed us.
They got the box.
|- Where's Jenny?
She took Angel|to get clothing.
I had some here.
- And we needed clothes because?
|- We got wet.
- Giles, what do we know?
|- The more I study the Judge, ..
the less I like him.
His touch can|literally burn the humanity out of you.
A true creature of evil can survive|the process.
No human ever has.
What's the problem?
We send Cordy|to fight this guy, and we go for pizza.
Can this guy be stopped?
Without an army?
Erm "No weapon forged can kill him".
|Not very encouraging.
If we could stop them from assembling him We need to figure out|where they'd be keeping him.
- This could take time.
|- Better do a round robin.
- Xander, you go first.
|- Round robin?
Everybody calls everybody else's mom and|says they're staying at everyone's house.
- Thus freeing us up for world saveage.
|- And all-night keggers.
What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?
Mom, hi Xander Yeah.
Willow and I|are gonna be studying all night long, so I think I read this already.
I can't get over|how cool Oz was about all this.
Gee, I'm over it.
You're just jealous|cos you didn't have a date for the party.
No, I sure didn't.
Angel?
Any luck?
It seems Buffy needed some rest.
She hasn't been sleeping well.
|Tossing and turning.
She told me.
Cos of her dreams?
Now, now!
Hands off my presents, No!
- Angel!
|- Buffy, it's OK.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
More music!
# If you want to know how|to fly high then go now to the place # Where all the concubines meet,|and converse with them # Marvel at their pale skin,|wonder how they chew on their pointy # Teeth and hair are beauty, they know|it's a duty to be Countess in their hearts Look what I have for you, ducks!
The best is saved for last.
# You know what flows there like wine # Sorrow is their master, cackling with|laughter, now he's having just one piece of # Cakey is their make-up,|Catholics try to shake up He's perfect, my darling.
Just what I wanted.
Cor You - What's that, mate?
|- You two stink of humanity.
You share affection and jealousy.
Yeah!
What of it?
Do I have to remind you that|we're the ones who brought you here?
Would you like a party favour?
This one is full of feeling.
|He reads.
Bring him to me.
What's with the bringing?
|I thought you could just zap people.
My full strength will return in time.
|Until then, I need contact.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Do it again!
Do it again!
- Buffy, what's happening?
|- I think I know where Spike and Drusilla are.
That's very good.
|However, you you do need a plan.
- You can't go off half-cocked.
|- I have a plan.
Angel and I do recon, see how far|they've got assembling the Judge.
You check any places the boxes could be|coming into town - shipping yards, airports.
We need to stop them|from getting all the boxes in one place.
Yes Yes, well,|actually that's quite a good plan.
This thing is nasty and it's real, Giles.
|We can't wait for it to come get us.
Right.
I saw this.
The party.
What?
What is it?
We gotta get outta here.
Well, well.
Look what we have here.
- Crashers.
|- Our invitations just got lost in the mail.
It's delicious.
I only dreamed|you'd come.
- Leave her alone!
|- Yeah, that'll work.
Now say "pretty please".
- The girl?
|- Chilling, isn't it?
She's so full of good intention.
Take me, Take me instead of her.
Er, you're not clear on the concept, pal.
|There is no "instead".
- Just first and second.
|- And if you go first, ..
you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
Don't touch him!
This way!
Go!
Come on.
We need to get inside.
- You're shaking like a leaf.
|- I'm cold.
Let me get you somethin'.
Put these on.
|Get under the covers just to warm up.
Sorry.
What?
Oh, um It's OK.
|I just have a cut or something.
Can I Let me see.
OK.
It's already closed.
You're fine.
You almost went away today.
We both did.
Angel I feel like I lost you.
You're right, though.
We can't be sure of anything I You what?
I love you.
I try not to, but I can't stop.
Me Me too.
I can't either.
- Buffy, maybe we shouldn't|- Don't.
Just kiss me.
Argh!
Buffy!
Buffy!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I'm not happy, pet.
Angel and the Slayer are still alive.
They know where we are and about|the Judge.
We should be vacating.
Nonsense.
They'll not disturb us here.
My Angel's too smart to face the Judge again.
What's Big Blue up to anyway?
|He just sits there.
I am preparing.
Yeah.
It's interesting to me that preparing|looks a bit like sitting on your ass.
- When do we destroy the world already?
|- My strength grows.
And with every life I take,|it will increase further.
So let's take some.
I'm bored.
- Angel?
|- Dru?
What is it?
Dru!
Darling, do you see something?
Angel?
Buffy!
Oh, no.
Hey.
Are you OK?
You want me to call 911?
No.
The pain is gone.
- You sure?
|- Yeah.
I feel just fine.
Morning!
- Morning.
|- So, did you have fun last night?
- Fun?
|- At Willow's.
Yeah!
Yeah.
|Fun at Willow's.
She's a fun machine.
- Are you hungry?
|- No.
No, I'm just gonna go take a shower.
- Well, if you hurry, I'll run you to school.
|- Thanks.
Is something wrong?
No!
What would be wrong?
I don't know.
You just look The bus depot was a total washout.
And may|I say, what a lovely place to spend the night.
What a vibrant cross section of Americana.
No vampires transporting boxes?
No, but a 400lb wino offered to wash my hair.
- What's up?
Where's Buffy?
|- She never checked in.
If the bus depot's as empty|as the docks and the airport Do you think this Judge|has been assembled?
- Yes.
|- Buffy could be We gotta find him.
We gotta go to that place,|that factory.
That's where they're holed up.
- Let's go.
|- And do what?
Besides be afraid and die.
Nobody's asking you to go.
If the|vampires need grooming tips, we'll call you.
Cordelia has a point.
|If Buffy and Angel were ..
harmed, we don't stand to fare much better.
Yeah?
Those of us with feelings|are gonna do somethin'.
- Xander!
|- No, Xander's right.
My God!
You people are all I'm upset|and I can't think of a mean word right now, ..
but that's what you are,|and we're goin' in the factory.
- Buffy!
|- We were just going to rescue you.
- Well, some of us were.
|- Well, I would have.
- Where's Angel?
|- He didn't check in with you guys?
- No.
|- What happened?
- The Judge, is he|- No assembly required.
He's active.
- Damn it.
|- Nearly killed us.
- Angel got us out.
|- Why didn't you call?
We thought Well, we had to hide.
We got stuck in the sewer tunnels|and, with the hiding, we just split up.
- No one's heard from him?
|- I'm sure he'll come by.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're right.
|- Buffy.
- The Judge, we must stop him.
|- I know.
- What can you tell us?
|- Not much.
I, um I kicked him.
It was just like a sudden fever.
|If he got his hands on me He won't need to.
The stronger he gets, he'll|be able to reduce us to charcoal with a look.
Also, not the prettiest man in town.
I'll continue researching.
|Look for a weak spot.
The rest of you should get to your classes.
Yeah, I better go too.
- I'll try the Net for anything on the Judge.
|- Thank you.
After classes I'll come and help you.
You might find something useful|if it's in I Can Read Book, You don't think Angel would have|gone after the Judge himself?
No.
He'd know better than that.
Maybe he just needed I don't know.
I just wish he'd contact me.
I need to talk to him.
Are we feeling better, then?
I'm naming all the stars.
You can't see the stars, love.
That's the ceiling.
Also, it's day.
I can see them.
But I've named them all the same name.
And there's terrible confusion.
Did you see any further?
|Do you know what happens to Angel?
Well He moves to New York|and tries to fulfil that Broadway dream.
It's tough slaying, but one day he's working|in the chorus when the star twists her ankle.
- You don't give up, do you?
|- As long as there's injustice in the world.
As long as scum like you is walking ..
well, rolling the streets, I'll be around.
Look over your shoulder.
I'll be there.
Yeah.
Angel um, look over your shoulder.
- Hurts, doesn't it?
|- Well, you know, it kind of itches a little.
- Don't just stand there.
Burn him!
|- Gee!
Maybe he's broken.
- What the hell is going on?
|- This one cannot be burned.
- He's clean.
|- Clean?
- You mean he's|- There's no humanity in him.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
- Angel.
|- Yeah, baby.
I'm back.
- Is it really true?
|- It's really true.
You've come home.
No more of this "I've got a soul" crap.
What can I say, hm?
I was goin' through a phase.
This is great!
This is so great.
Everything in my head is singing.
We're family again.
We'll feed ..
and we'll play.
I've gotta tell you.
It made me sick to my|stomach seeing you be the Slayer's lapdog.
- How did this happen?
|- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Who cares?
What matters is now he's back.
Now it's four against one,|which are the kind of odds I like to play.
We're going to destroy the world.
|Want to come?
Yeah, destroying the world.
Great.
I'm really more interested in the Slayer.
Well, she's in the world,|so that should work out.
- Give me tonight.
|- What do you mean?
Lay low for a night.
I guarantee, by the time you go public,|she won't be anything resembling a threat.
You've really got a yen|to hurt this girl, haven't you?
She made me feel like a human being.
That's not the kinda thing you just forgive.
OK.
No.
No, we didn't but I'm sure he'll Well, Buffy, he probably has some plan|and he's trying to protect you.
Well, I don't know what.
|I'm not in on the plan.
It's his plan.
No!
Don't even say that.
- Angel is not dead.
|- Say hi for me.
Yeah, of course we'll be here.
OK.
Bye.
- "Say hi for me"?
|- What's the word?
She's checked every place she could think|of.
She even beat up Willy the Snitch twice.
- Angel's vanished.
|- But he does do that on occasion, no?
Well, yeah.
But she's extra-wigged this time.
I guess cos of her dreams.
What if something really happened to him?
- Is she gonna join us here?
|- Yeah, she's just stopping at home first.
Nada, Did you find anything?
This book mentions the Judge,|but nothing useful.
"Big, scary, no weapon forged can stop him.
|Took an army to take him down".
Blah blah blah.
We need some insight.
A weak spot.
Well, we're not gonna find it here.
- Sorry I snapped at you before.
|- I'm reeling from that new experience.
I was crazed.
I wasn't thinking.
I know.
You were too busy rushing off|to die for your beloved Buffy.
- You'd never die for me.
|- No, I might die from you.
- Does that get me any points?
|- No!
- Come on, can't we just kiss and make up?
|- I don't wanna make up.
But I'm OK with the other part.
Willow!
We were just Willow!
Willow!
- Willow, come on!
|- I knew it!
I knew it!
Well, I didn't have the slightest idea,|but I knew there was something I didn't know.
You two were fighting way too much!
|It's not natural.
- I know it's weird.
|- Weird?
It's against all laws of God and man.
It's Cordelia!
Remember?
The "We Hate Cordelia Club",|of which you are the treasurer?
- I was gonna tell you.
|- What stopped you?
Could it be shame?
- Let's overreact!
|- But Willow.
We were just kissing.
|It doesn't mean that much.
No.
It just means that you'd rather be|with someone you hate than be with me.
- Angel!
|- Hey.
Oh, my God!
I was so worried.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
- Where did you go?
|- Been around.
Oh, my God.
I was freaking out.
You just disappeared!
What?
I took off.
But you didn't say anything.
You just left.
Yeah.
Like I really wanted|to stick around after that.
- What?
|- You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo.
Although I guess you proved that last night.
- Are you saying|- Let's not make an issue out of it, OK?
In fact, let's not talk about it at all.
- It happened.
|- I don't understand.
Was it me?
Was I not good?
You were great.
Really.
|I thought you were a pro.
How can you say this to me?
Lighten up.
It was a good time.
|It doesn't mean we have to make a big deal.
- It is a big deal!
|- It's what?
Bells ringing?
Fireworks?
A dulcet choir of pretty little birdies?
Come on, Buffy.
|It's not like I've never been there before.
Don't touch me.
I should have known|you wouldn't be able to handle it.
Angel!
I love you.
I love you, too.
I'll call you.
You know what it is, this vengeance?
Uncle, I have served you.
|I have been faithful.
I need to know.
To the modern man,|vengeance is a word, an idea.
Payback.
One thing for another.
|Like commerce.
Not with us.
Vengeance is a living thing.
It passes through generations.
It commands.
It kills.
You told me to watch Angel.
You told me|to keep him from the Slayer.
I tried.
But there are other factors.
Terrible things|are happening here that we cannot control.
We control nothing.
We are not wizards, Jana.
We merely play a part.
Angel could be of help to us.
He may be the only chance|we have to stop the Judge.
It is too late for that.
- Why?
|- The curse.
Angel was meant to suffer.
Not to live as human.
One moment of true happiness,|of contentment, ..
one moment where the soul that we|restored no longer plagues his thoughts, ..
and that soul is taken from him.
Then, if somehow, if If it's happened, - ..
then Angelus is back.
|- I hoped to stop it, ..
but I realise now it was arranged to be so.
- Buffy loves him.
|- And now she will have to kill him.
Unless he kills her first!
|Uncle, this is insanity!
People are going to die.
Yes.
It is not justice we serve.
It is vengeance.
You're a fool.
We're all fools.
Will.
Hey.
- Where'd you go?
|- Home.
I'm glad you came back.
|We can't do this without you.
Let's get this straight.
I don't understand it.
|I don't wanna understand it.
You have gross emotional problems|and things are not OK between us.
But what's happening right now|is more important than that.
OK.
- What about the Judge?
Where do we stand?
|- On a pile of books that say the same thing.
- Let me guess.
"No weapon forged"|- "It took an army" Yeah, where's an army when you need one?
- What?
|- Whoa.
Whoa!
I think I'm havin' a thought.
Yeah, yeah, that's a thought.
Now I'm having a plan.
Now I'm havin' a wiggins.
What's going on?
- Let's get to the library.
|- Willow!
- Xander.
|- Angel.
Thank God you're OK.
Did you see Buffy?
Yeah.
What's up with the lights?
I don't know.
Listen, I have an idea.
Forget about that now.
|I got somethin' to show you.
- Show us?
|- Yeah.
Xander, go get the others.
OK.
And, Willow, come here.
- What is it, Angel?
|- It's amazing.
- Willow, get away from him!
|- What?
- Walk to me.
|- What are you talking about?
- Don't do that!
|- Oh, I think I do that.
- Angel!
|- He's not Angel any more.
- Are you?
|- Wrong.
I am Angel at last.
- Oh, my God.
|- I got a message for Buffy.
Why don't you give it to me yourself?
It's not really the kind of message you tell.
It sort of involves finding|the bodies of all your friends.
- This can't be you.
|- We already covered that subject.
Angel, there must be some part|of you that remembers who you are.
Dream on, schoolgirl.
Your boyfriend is dead.
- You're all gonna join him.
|- Leave Willow alone and deal with me.
But she's so cute and helpless.
|It's really a turn-on.
Things are about to get very interesting.
Buffy, are you OK?
Buffy?
And we're absolutely certain|that Angel has reverted to his former self?
Yeah.
We're all certain.
|Anyone not feeling certain here?
Giles, you wouldn't have believed him.
He was so He came here to kill us.
- What are we gonna do?
|- I'm leaning towards blind panic.
- Rupert, don't talk like that.
The kids|- I'm sorry.
Things are bad enough with the Judge here.
Angel crossing over to the other side|I wasn't prepared for that.
None of us were.
Are you OK?
Is there anything I can do?
I should have known.
I saw him at the house.
He was different.
|The things he said - What things?
|- It's private.
- But you didn't know he had turned bad?
|- How did you?
- What?
|- Well, you knew.
- You told me to get away from him.
|- Well, I saw his face.
If only we knew how it happened.
- What do you mean?
|- Some event must have triggered it.
If anyone would know, Buffy,|it should be you.
- I don't|- Did anything happen last night - Giles, please!
I can't|- Buffy, I'm sorry, but we can't afford to - Buffy!
|- Giles, shut up.
This is great.
An unkillable demon|is in town.
Angel's joined his team.
The Slayer's a basket case.
|I'd say we've hit bottom.
- I have a plan.
|- Oh, no!
Here's a lower place.
I don't know about Angel,|but I may have a way to deal with the Judge.
- What do we do?
|- I think, um I think I may need Cordelia for this one.
- And we may need wheels.
|- Well, my car is - It might have to be bigger.
|- No problem.
I'll get Oz.
He has a van.
Good.
OK.
- Care to let me in on the plan I'm a part of?
|- No.
- Why not?
|- Because if I tell you, then you won't do it.
Just meet me at Willow's house in half|an hour and wear something trashyer.
I'm not sure what we should do about Buffy.
Assuming they don't attack tonight,|we should let her be.
I agree.
I I can imagine what she's going through.
No I don't think you can.
You should have seen her face.
|It was priceless!
I'll never forget it.
- So you didn't kill her, then?
|- Course not.
Now, I know you haven't been|in the game for a while, mate, ..
but we still do kill people.
It's sort of our raison d'être, you know?
You don't wanna kill her, do you?
You want to hurt her, ..
just like you hurt me.
- Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
|- She'd better not get in our way.
- Don't worry about it.
|- I do.
Spike my boy!
You really don't get it, do you?
You tried to kill her, but you couldn't.
|Look at you, you're a wreck!
She's stronger than any Slayer|you've ever faced.
Force won't get it done.
You gotta work from the inside.
To kill this girl, you have to love her.
I love you.
You have to know what to see.
- Buffy?
Buffy!
|- What do you know?
- Should I get the principal?
|- No, I'll deal with this.
You're all dismissed.
Did you do it?
Did you change him?
- For God's sake, calm down.
|- Did you know this was gonna happen?
I didn't know exactly.
I was told Oh, God.
I was sent here to watch you.
|They told me to keep you and Angel apart.
- I didn't know what would happen.
|- Jenny I'm sorry, Rupert.
Angel was supposed to pay|for what he did to my people.
And me?
What was I supposed|to be paying for?
I didn't know what would happen until after.
|I swear I would have told you.
So it was me.
I did it.
I think so.
- I mean|- I don't understand.
The curse.
If Angel achieved true happiness, even|just a moment of he would lose his soul.
But how do you know|you were responsible for - If there's anything that|- Curse him again.
No, I can't.
Those magics|are long lost, even to my people.
- You did it once.
It might not be too late.
|- It can't be done.
I can't help you.
Then take me to someone who can.
I knew she would bring you.
I suppose you want answers.
Not really.
But thanks for the offer.
Left!
Left!
Left!
Wait here.
|When you guys see that window open, ..
get out the ladder, come up.
|We'll pass you the package, OK?
Be careful.
The security here really is a joke.
|I should report it.
- Who am I supposed to be again?
|- A girl.
Think you can handle it?
Halt!
Identify yourself right the hell now!
Uh Private Harris with the, uh 33rd.
Right.
Uh I'm on leave from them.
You always spend your leave snoopin'|round the armoury?
And who is she?
Hi.
I'm not a soldier.
Right?
Look, I just wanna give her the tour.
|You know what I'm sayin'.
- The tour.
|- Well, the ladies like to see the big guns.
Gets them all hot and bothered.
- Can you cut me some slack?
|- Why should I?
So I won't tell Colonel Newsome|that your boots ain't regulation, ..
your post wasn't covered|and you hold your gun like a sissy.
- You got 20 minutes, Nimrod.
|- I just need five.
Uh forget I said that last part.
OK.
What was that?
And who are you?
At Halloween, I got turned into a soldier.
Yeah.
I still remember all of it.
|I know procedure, ordnance, access codes.
I know the layout for this base and I'm pretty|sure I can put together an M-16 in 57 seconds.
I'm sort of impressed.
But let's just|find the thing and get out of here.
OK.
So does looking at guns really make|girls wanna have sex?
That's scary.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, does looking at guns|make you wanna have sex?
I'm 17.
Looking at linoleum|makes me wanna have sex.
I wish they'd hurry.
So, do you guys steal weapons|from the army a lot?
Well, we don't have cable,|so we have to make our own fun.
I get you.
Do you wanna make out with me?
- What?
|- Forget it.
I'm sorry.
Well, do you?
Sometimes when I'm sittin' in class, ..
not thinkin' about class,|cos that would never happen, ..
I think about kissin' you and it's like|everything stops.
It's like freeze-frame.
Willow kissage.
Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you.
What?
But freeze-frame.
Well, to the casual observer, it would appear|that you were trying to make Xander jealous.
Or even the score, or something.
And that's on the empty side.
See, in my fantasy, when I'm kissin' you ..
you're kissin' me.
It's OK.
I can wait.
We're up.
Oh, my God.
He's doing this deliberately, Buffy.
He's trying to make it harder for you.
He's only making it easier.
|I know what I have to do.
What?
Kill him.
- I am ready.
|- About time.
- Have fun.
|- Too bad you can't come with, huh?
Be thinkin' of you.
I won't be in this chair forever.
- What happens if your girlfriend shows up?
|- I'm gonna give her a kiss.
Don't you look spiffy!
Spiffy?
Happy birthday, Buffy.
|I hope you like the colour.
We try the factory first, but they're on the|attack.
We need to figure out where they'd go.
Agreed.
This is good.
Do you, uh Is there something I can do?
Get out.
I just wanna help.
She said "Get out".
- Do you want me to show you how to use it?
|- Yes, I do.
I knew it.
We haven't a bead on where they would go.
I don't know.
Uh Somewhere crowded, I guess.
|The judge needs bodies, right?
- The Bronze?
|- It's closed tonight.
There's not a lot of choices here.
|People don't line up to get massacred.
Uh, guys.
If I were gonna line up, I know where I'd go.
Lock the exits, boys.
It's all yours.
Everybody keep back.
Damage control only.
|Take out any lesser vamps.
I'll take the smurf.
Oh, goody.
Who dares?
- I think I got his attention.
|- You're a fool.
No weapon forged can stop me.
That was then.
This is now.
What's that do?
- Best present ever.
|- I knew you'd like it.
- Do you think he's dead?
|- We can't be sure.
- Pick up the pieces and keep them separate.
|- Pieces?
We get the pieces.
Our job sucks!
You know what the worst part was, huh?
|Pretending that I loved you.
If I'd known how easily you'd give it up,|I wouldn't have even bothered.
It doesn't work any more.
You're not Angel.
You'd like to think that.
It doesn't matter.
The important thing is|you made me the man I am today.
Uh arm.
You're not quittin' on me already, are ya?
Come on, Buffy.
You know you want it, huh?
You can't do it.
You can't kill me.
Give me time.
It's not over.
I suppose you know that.
He'll come after you particularly.
His profile He's likely to strike out at|the things that made him the most human.
- You must be so disappointed in me.
|- No.
- No.
No, I'm not.
|- This is all my fault.
I don't believe it is.
Do you want me to wag my finger|at you and say you acted rashly?
You did, and I can.
I know that you loved him.
And he has proven|more than once that he loved you.
You couldn't have known|what would happen.
The coming months are gonna be hard|I suspect, on all of us.
But if it's guilt you're looking for,|Buffy, I'm not your man.
All you will get from me is my support ..
and my respect.
# Good night, my love # My moment with you now is ending Did I miss anything?
Oh, just some singing|and some running round.
Oh.
I'm sorry I didn't have time|to make you a real cake.
No.
This is good.
But we're still going shopping on Saturday.
So what did you do for your birthday?
- Did you have fun?
|- I got older.
You look the same to me.
Happy birthday.
I don't have to sing, do I?
No.
Well, go on.
Make a wish.
I'll just let it burn.
# Good night, my love # Remember that you're mine # Sweetheart
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, - Hi.
|- Oh, that's what I was gonna say.
- What you lookin' at?
|- This cheerleading trophy.
It's like its eyes follow you wherever you go.
- I like it.
|- So, did you like the movie last night?
I don't know.
Today's movies are|kinda like popcorn, you know?
You forget about 'em as soon as they're done.
- I do remember I liked the popcorn, though.
|- Yeah, it was good.
And I had a really fun time with the rest.
|I mean, the part with you.
Well, that's great.
|My time was also of the good.
Mine too.
Well, then Oh, there!
I have ..
my friend, so I will go to her.
I'll see you, then, later.
Ohh Man!
Oz!
I would love to get me some|of that Buffy and Willow action!
That's great, Larry.
|You've really mastered the single entendre.
- Hey!
|- Oops.
Oh, thank you, Thighmaster!
So, Oz, man, what's up with that?
|Dating a junior?
Oh, let me guess.
That little, innocent|schoolgirl thing is just an act, right?
Yeah.
She's actually an evil mastermind.
|It's fun.
I mean, she's gotta be puttin' out, or what's|the point?
What are you gonna do?
Talk?
Come on, fess up.
How far have you got?
Nowhere.
I mean, he said he was gonna|wait until I was ready, but I'm ready!
Honest, I'm good to go here.
It's nice if he's not just being an animal.
Maybe it's nice.
He's great!
We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!
- Have you dropped any hints?
|- I've dropped anvils.
Oh, he'll come around.
What guy|could resist your wily Willow charms?
At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.
None of them know a thing.
|They all get an F in Willow.
But I want Oz to get an A.|And oh, one of those gold stars.
- He will.
|- Well, he'd better hurry.
I don't wanna be the only girl|in school without a real boyfriend.
Oh, I'm such an idiot!
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't even be talking about - Do you want me to go away?
|- I wish you wouldn't.
- How are you holding up, anyway?
|- I'm holding.
I had two minutes there|without thinking of Angel.
There you go!
I'd do a lot better if we could do|that sharing our misery thing tonight.
Great.
I'll give Xander a call.
What's his number?
|Oh, yeah.
1-800-I'm-dating-a-skanky-ho.
- Meow!
|- Really?
Thanks.
I've never gotten a "meow" before.
- Well deserved.
|- Darn tootin'!
I'm just saying, Xander and Cordelia|What does he see in her, anyway?
What could she possibly see in him?
Excuse me?
!
We didn't come here|to talk about Willow.
We came to do things I can't tell my father|about, because he thinks I'm a good girl.
I just don't trust Oz with her.
|I mean, he's a senior.
He's attractive.
OK, maybe not to me, but And he's in a band.
|We know what kind that attracts.
- I've dated lots of guys in bands.
|- Thank you.
- Do you even wanna be here?
|- I'm not running away.
When you're not babbling|about poor Willow, - ..
you rave about the all-powerful Buffy.
|- I do not babble.
I occasionally run on.
- Every now and then I yammer.
|- Xander, look around.
We're in my daddy's car.
|It's just the two of us.
There is a beautiful,|big full moon outside tonight.
It doesn't get more romantic than this,|so shut up!
- Did you hear that?
|- What is it now?
- I thought I heard something.
|- Is Willow sending a distress signal ..
that only you can hear?
OK, now I know I heard something.
That's it!
Your mind hasn't been here|all night.
How about I just drop you off Get outta here!
- I can't find the key!
|- We should be movin'!
Let's go!
Told ya I heard somethin'.
- You're sure it was a werewolf?
|- Well, let's see Um, six feet tall, claws, a big old snout|in the middle of his face, like a wolf.
- Yeah, I'm stickin' with my first guess.
|- Seems wise.
There was that thing where it tried to bite us.
- It was so awful!
|- I know.
Daddy just had this car detailed!
- So, what's the word?
|- There were other attacks ..
by a "wild dog" around town.
Several|animal carcasses were found mutilated.
You mean like bunnies and stuff?
|No, don't tell me.
Don't worry.
They might not look it,|but bunnies can take care of themselves.
- Yeah.
|- Yeah.
Yes.
Er, fortunately no people were injured.
- That falls into "That's a Switch" column.
|- For now, but it will be back next full moon.
- What about tonight's full moon?
|- Pardon?
Last night was the night before the full moon,|known as ..
the night before the full moon.
So, the legend that werewolves only prowl|during a full moon might be erroneous?
- Or it could be a crock.
|- Unless it was using last year's almanac.
- Giles has some schoolin' to do.
|- Yes, I must admit, I'm intrigued.
Werewolves.
It's one of the classics.
I'm sure my books and I are|in for a fascinating afternoon.
He needs to get a pet.
Sunnydale is becoming|more dangerous all the time.
A full moon like tonight|tends to bring out the crazies.
But with some simple basics|of self-defence, ..
each of you can learn|how to protect yourself.
Here's a suggestion:|move away from the Hellmouth.
Tag.
Would you look at that!
He's all over her!
|Psst!
Hey, buddy, this is a public forum here!
I think you've splashed on just|a little too much Obsession for Dorks.
OK, everyone get into your assigned groups.
- What happened?
|- Oh, last week ..
some huge dog jumped|out of the bushes and bit me.
I've been there, man.
My cousin Jordy|just got his grown-up teeth in.
Does not like to be tickled.
Theresa!
Be still, my shorts.
We're in the same group.
|I may have to attack you.
No, actually,|I think in our group there are a few of us.
And I'm one of the few.
Don't forget, you're supposed to be|a meek little girlie girl, like the rest of us.
Spoil my fun!
OK, everyone listen up.
I wanna show you|what to do if you are attacked from behind.
In this situation, bend forward, ..
using your back and shoulders|to flip the assailant over to the ground.
Nuh!
- Nuh!
|- Oh, Summers, you are turnin' me on!
And that works, too.
And while there is no scientific explanation|for the lunar effect on the human psyche, ..
the phases of the moon seem to exert|a great deal of psychological influence.
The full moon seems to|bring out our darkest qualities.
And yet, ironically,|it led to the invention of the MoonPie.
Yes, MoonPie!
You see, the werewolf is such a potent, ..
extreme representation|of our inborn animalistic traits, ..
it emerges for three consecutive nights, the|full moon and the two nights surrounding it.
- Quite the party animal.
|- Quite, and it acts on pure instinct.
No conscience.
Predatory and aggressive.
- In other words, your typical male.
|- On behalf of my gender - hey!
- Let's not jump to conclusions.
|- I didn't jump.
I took a step and there conclusions were.
The point is that our wolfman could also be a|wolfwoman, or anyone bitten by a werewolf.
- So, I'm guessing silver bullets are in order?
|- No, no bullets.
No matter who this werewolf is,|it's a human being, ..
who may be completely|unaware of his or her condition.
So, tonight we bring him back alive.
- Anything yet?
|- Yes, and you won't believe what I saw!
Brittany Podelle was making out with Owen|Stadeal, but he goes with Bara Williams.
If No, no sign of the werewolf.
How about you?
The same.
I thought we might knock on a few windows,|ask if anyone's seen the thing yet.
Giles, no one's seen anything.
Oh.
Yes.
No.
Of course not, no.
Yes.
Gotcha!
- What the hell?
|- Giles!
Giles!
Hey!
Whoa!
- Hands are good right there.
|- Who are you?
What are you doing?
The name's Kane.
I'm the one with the gun,|which means I get to do the interviewing.
Hey, before we get all chummy here,|how about we do something about this net?
- Are you all right?
|- Yeah.
- I gotta say, I'm impressed.
|- Excuse me?
- It's good to get the fruit while it's fresh.
|- You'd be wise to take that back.
What a man and a girl do|in Lovers' Lane at night is OK, enough, Repulsive Brain!
|It's not what you think.
We're hunting werewolves.
OK, it's funny if you don't|believe in werewolves.
No, it's funny thinking about|you two catching one.
This guy looks like he's auditioning to be|a librarian and you Well, you're a girl.
I assure you, she's quite capable.
Let me ask you somethin', sweetheart.
How|many of these animals have you taken out?
As of today?
I tore a tooth from the mouth|of every werewolf that I killed.
This next one'll bring|the total to an even dozen.
- So, you're just gonna kill it?
|- Well, that's the thing.
Their pelts fetch a pretty penny|in Sri Lanka and it's hard to skin 'em alive.
- You hunt werewolves for sport?
|- No, no.
I'm in it purely for the money.
It doesn't bother you that a werewolf is|a person 28 days out of the month?
That's why I only hunt 'em the other three.
I'd really love to stay and chat,|but I'm on a tight schedule.
Any idea where else the boys|and girls get together around here?
- You're looking for a party?
|- No, but the werewolf is.
They're suckers for that whole|sexual heat thing.
Sense it miles away.
If this little doggy ain't here,|I guess he found another place.
Sorry.
Wish I could help you.
But you don't know squat?
|Gee, what a surprise!
- Where are we going?
|- I think I know where to look.
We just have to make it there|before "Mein Furrier".
- Everything OK?
|- Yeah, I just, uh I thought I heard something behind me.
No one there.
I guess I was wrong.
I coulda sworn It's OK.
It can get pretty scary out here,|all alone at night.
Yeah.
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
Don't you go to school with Buffy?
- Oh, you know Buffy?
|- Yes, I do, very well.
Come on.
I'll get you home.
With Xander, it's always|"Buffy did this, Willow said that".
"Buffy, Buffy, Willow, Willow".
|It's like I don't even exist!
- I sometimes feel like that.
|- When I call him on it, he acts confused.
- Like I have a problem.
|- His "Do I smell something"?
look.
All a part of his little guy games.
|It's like he's there, then he's not there.
- He wants it, but then he doesn't want it.
|- He's busy looking at what he doesn't have - ..
and doesn't realise what he does have.
|- He should at least realise that you have Oz.
Hm, I'm not sure I do.
|Oz and I are in some sort of holding pattern.
Except without the holding|or anything else.
What's he waiting for?
What's his problem?
|Oh, that's right.
He's a guy.
- Yeah, him and Xander, guys,|- Who do they think they are?
Couple of guys, - Looks as though your hunch was right.
|- Who could resist our house of hormones?
- The werewolf, it's in there!
|- Comin' through!
- You let it get away.
|- I didn't let it do anything.
- I had the chain around its neck.
|- Chain?
!
- Were you gonna take it for a walk?
|- I was going to lock it up.
That's beautiful.
This is what happens|when a woman tries to do a man's job.
Now you look here, Mr Kane.
This girl|risked her life, trying to capture a beast ..
that you haven't been able to find.
Daddy's doin' a great job|carryin' her bag of Milk-Bones.
You know, sis, if that thing harms anyone,|it's going to be on your pretty little head.
- I hope you can live with that.
|- I live with that every day.
First they tell me I can't|hunt an elephant for its ivory.
Now I've gotta deal with People for|the Ethical Treatment of Werewolves!
Pillock!
Right, let's move out.
Giles?
Giles!
I didn't see you there.
- I thought something had happened.
|- Oh, no, I'm I'm OK.
I'm just, erm, fine.
Er, just I'm, er, OK.
Er, any sign of the werewolf?
No.
I guess you didn't see anything, from|the vantage point of having your eyes closed.
- It's going to be light soon, so we|- Wait!
Police say that the incident was|connected to the animal mutilation ..
which occurred two nights ago,|the coroner's office identified the body ..
as that of Sunnydale High School|student Theresa Klussmeyer, age 17, Buffy, we're gonna get this thing.
|We have another whole night.
There's nothing more we can do now.
|It's nearly sunrise.
That werewolf won't be|a werewolf much longer.
Aunt Maureen?
Hey, it's me.
Uh, what?
Oh, it's Actually, it's healin' OK.
That's pretty much the reason I called.
|Um, I wanna ask you somethin'.
Is Jordy a werewolf?
And how long has that been goin' on?
What?
No, no reason.
Um Thanks.
Yeah, love to Uncle Ken.
I can't believe I let it go!
Kane was right.
|I shoulda killed it when I had the chance.
- Killed what?
|- Er, the werewolf.
It was out last night.
Is everybody OK?
|Did anybody get bitten or scratched?
No, we're fine.
- Gladness.
|- Yeah, but it got someone.
Theresa.
Got, as in?
Oh, I'm sorry.
And I coulda stopped it.
Well, we have one more night.
- Another night?
|- Oh, yeah.
Believe me, I'm gonna give|that wolfie somethin' to howl about.
But while we're doing nothing, there's a|human werewolf out there, making fun of us.
The way werewolves always do.
- But there's really no way to tell who it is.
|- Oh, sure there is.
Giles knows stuff and|I'm practically an expert.
On account of once you were a hyena?
I know what it's like to crave|the taste of freshly-killed meat.
To be taken over by|those uncontrollable urges.
You said you didn't remember|anything about that.
I said I didn't remember anything about that.
Look, the point is that I have an affinity|with this thing.
I can get inside of its head.
I'm a big bad wolf.
I'm on the prowl.
I'm sniffin', I'm snarlin',|I'm a slobbering predator, I'm Wait a second!
It's right in front of us!
It's obvious who I am.
I'm Larry!
The guy's practically got|"Wolf Boy" stamped on his forehead.
You got the dog bite, you got the aggression,|not to mention excessive back hair.
And he was gleeful|about tormenting Theresa.
- Still, that doesn't necessarily mean|- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Gonna force a confession outta him.
|- Good.
Go.
In the meantime,|we need to cover our bases.
Willow, ..
check the student files.
|See if anybody else fits the profile.
- Buffy|- Where are we going?
If none of that works,|I think I may have an alternative.
Yeah, me and the werewolf alone in|a cage for three minutes.
That's all I ask.
- Are you OK?
|- What?
- You kind of knew Theresa.
|- Oh, yeah, I, uh I'm tryin' not to think about it.
It's - It's a lot.
|- It is.
But we can do stuff to help.
|Sometimes it feels good to help.
Well, like looking up stuff.
I'm gonna be doing that most of the night.
|You could help me.
Help together?
I can't.
Um, uh I'm busy.
Oh.
So I I gotta go.
Harris, jeesh!
Next time, wear a bell.
Why so jumpy, Larry?
- Geeks make me nervous.
|- Is that really it, ..
or is there something you're hiding?
I could hide my fist in your face.
I know your secret, big guy.
|I know what you been doin' at night.
You know, Harris, that nosey little nose of|yours is gonna get you into trouble someday.
- Like today.
|- Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away.
People are still gonna find out.
All right, what do you want?
|Hush money?
Is that what you're after?
- I don't want anything.
I just wanna help.
|- What, you think you have a cure?
No, it's just I know what you're|goin' through, because I've been there.
- That's why I know you should talk about it.
|- That's easy for you to say.
I mean, you're nobody.
|I've got a reputation here.
- Larry, please, before someone else is hurt!
|- Look, if this gets out, it's over for me.
I mean, forget about playin' football.
|They'll run me out of this town.
I mean, come on!
How are people gonna|look at me after they find out I'm gay?
Wow.
I said it.
And it felt OK.
I'm gay.
I am gay!
- I heard you the first time.
|- I can't believe it.
It was almost easy.
I've never felt I could tell anyone.
And then you, you of all people,|you bring it out of me!
It probably woulda slipped out,|even if I wasn't here.
No, because knowing you went through the|same thing made it easier for me to admit.
- The same thing|- It's ironic.
All those times I beat the crap outta you It must have been because|I recognised something in you ..
that I didn't wanna believe about myself.
- Larry, no.
I am not|- Of course.
Of course not.
Don't worry.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Your secret's safe with me.
Oh, wow.
So, what's the scuttlebutt?
Anybody|besides Larry fit our werewolf profile?
There is one name that keeps getting spit out.
Aggressive behaviour,|run-ins with authorities - About a screenful of violent incidents.
|- OK, most of those were not my fault.
They started 'em.
I stood up for myself!
It's good to count to ten when you're angry.
One.
Two.
- Three.
|- I'll keep looking!
I, um noticed you were lookin' solo.
Yeah.
Oz wanted to be someplace that was ..
away from me.
- I'm sorry.
|- I can't figure him out.
I mean, he's so hot and cold.
|Or lukewarm and cold.
Welcome to the mystery that is men.
|It goes something like They grow body hair and lose|all ability to tell you what they want.
That doesn't seem like a fair trade.
Well, if you want to up the speed quotient|with Oz, you need to do something daring.
Maybe you need to make the first move.
- That won't make me a slut?
|- I think your reputation will remain intact.
It used to be easy to tell if a boy liked you.
He'd punch you on the arm|and then run back to his friends.
- Those were the days.
|- Hey.
I'll see you guys later.
Cordelia asked me to|look at her history homework before class.
I think that means I might have to do it.
Wow, those two gals are hanging out a lot|together.
This'd be a good time to panic.
- So, how'd it go with Larry?
|- What's that supposed to mean?
- "How'd it go with Larry"?
|- He's not the werewolf.
Can't we just leave it at that?
|Must you continue to push and push?
- Sorry, I was just wondering.
|- He's not.
- OK.
|- OK.
But there goes our lead suspect,|which then puts us back at square boned.
You're not boned, you're Buffy.
Eradicator of evil,|defender of things that need defending.
Tell that to Theresa.
She could have used my|defending before she was ripped apart by a Werewolf.
Nowhere in any of the reports did it|say anything about her being mauled.
They were linked to the animal attacks,|so we assumed werewolf.
What else should we assume?
Vampire.
So, that's good, right?
In the sense|of the werewolf didn't get her and No, there is no good here.
No good.
Instead of not protecting|Theresa from the werewolf, ..
I was able to not protect her|from something just as bad.
She had a lot of friends.
Buffy, you can't blame yourself|for every death in Sunnydale.
If it weren't for you,|people'd be lined up to get buried.
Willow would be Robbie the Robot's|love slave, I wouldn't have a head and ..
Theresa's a vampire.
Angel sends his love.
Angel Are you OK?
This isn't happening.
- He's gonna keep coming after me.
|- Don't let him get to you.
He's not the same guy you knew.
Oh, no, my life's not too complicated.
- Willow, what are you doing here?
|- I had this whole thing worked out.
I wrote it down, but it didn't make|any sense when I read it back.
- Willow, this is not a very good time.
|- What am I supposed to think?
First you buy me popcorn,|and then you're all glad that I didn't get bit.
And you put the tag back in my shirt.
|But I guess none of that means anything, ..
because instead of looking up names with|me, you're alone, doing nothing, by yourself.
- Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow.
|- No, dammit!
We'll talk about this now!
Buffy said that what a girl makes|has to be the first move ..
and now I'm starting to think|the written version sounded good.
- But you know what I mean.
|- I know, I know.
It's me.
I'm going through some changes.
Well, welcome to the world!
Things happen.
|Don't you think I'm going through a lot?
- Not like me.
|- Oh, what?
So now you're special?
You're Special Boy.
With chains and stuff?
Why do you have chains and stuff?
Willow, please!
Get outta here!
Oz?
Oz, what is it?
What's wrong?
There you are!
Sorry I'm late.
I had to do some|unscheduled slayage in the form of Theresa.
- She's a vampire?
|- Was.
Angel sent her as a token of affection.
- Buffy, I'm so sorry.
|- Not now, Giles.
We can all have ourselves a good cry|after we bag us a werewolf.
- All set.
Let's go find this thing.
|- One question How do we find this thing?
It's Oz!
It's Oz!
- What's Oz?
|- The werewolf.
- Are you certain?
|- Just trust me on this.
He said he was going through all these|changes, then he went through changes.
- Where is he?
|- In the woods.
- Let's go.
|- Go where?
You're not gonna kill Oz!
- He's a werewolf, but he doesn't mean to be.
|- We're not gonna hurt him.
We've put enough phenobarbital in this|to sink a small elephant, or a large werewolf.
That's it.
Let me see you.
Come on, suppertime!
Good doggy!
Now play dead.
Careful!
Dammit!
I shot Oz!
You saved us.
No wonder this town's|overrun with monsters.
- No one here's man enough to kill 'em!
|- I wouldn't be too sure of that.
How about you let the door hit you|in the ass on the way outta town?
Is he gonna be OK?
He'll be a little sore in the morning,|but he'll be Oz.
This is all so weird.
How are we|supposed to act when we see him?
It's gotta be weird for him too,|now that we know so much.
I know we'll never|look at him the same again.
- He's still a human being most of the time.
|- Who are we talking about?
- Oz.
Who are you talking about?
|- No one.
Here, let me get those.
Hey, Xander, look, about what you did - I owe you.
|- What did you do?
It's really nothing|we should be talking about.
Ever.
I know, I know.
It's just, well Thanks.
- That was weird.
|- It's not OK for one guy to like another guy, ..
just because he was in the locker room|with him and nothing happened?
Don't push!
- I meant he didn't try to look up my skirt.
|- Oh, yeah, that's the weirdness.
Weirdness abounds lately.
|Maybe it's the moon.
- It does stuff to people.
|- I've heard that.
It'll put a strain on|Willow and Oz's relationship.
What relationship?
|What life could they possibly have together?
Obedience school, paper-training Oz is always in the back, burying things.
|That breed can turn on its owner.
- I don't know.
I see Oz as the loyal type.
|- She's not safe with him.
If it were up to me Xander, it's not up to you.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
Did you wanna go first?
I spoke to Giles.
He said I'll be OK.
I have|to lock myself up around the full moon.
Only he used more words|than that.
And a globe.
I'm sorry about how all this ended up,|with me shooting you an' all.
It's OK.
I'm sorry I almost ate you.
It's OK.
- I kinda thought you would have told me.
|- I didn't know what to say.
It's not every day you find out you're|a werewolf.
That's fairly freaksome.
- It may take a couple of days getting used to.
|- Yeah, it's a complication.
So Maybe it'd be best if I just sorta What?
Well, you know, like|stayed out of your way for a while.
I don't know.
I'm kind of OK with you being in my way.
You mean, you'd still?
Well, I like you.
You're nice and you're funny.
And you don't smoke.
Yeah, OK, werewolf,|but that's not all the time.
I mean, three days out of the month,|I'm not much fun to be around, either.
You are quite a human.
So, I'd still if you'd still.
I'd still.
I'd very still.
OK.
- No biting, though.
|- Agreed.
A werewolf in love!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- So what do you think?
|- It's nice.
But do you think Cordelia will like it?
I don't know.
|Does she know what one of these is?
OK, big yucks.
When are you gonna|stop makin' fun of me for dating Cordelia?
I'm sorry.
But never.
I just think you could find|somebody more better.
Yeah.
Parallel universe, maybe.
Here the only other person|I'm interested in is, um, unavailable.
Besides, Cordy and I are really gettin' along.
Yesterday we sat together, not even speakin'.
|You know, just enjoying comfortable silence.
Man, that was dull.
I'm glad that you guys are getting along.
|Almost really.
And don't stress over the gift.
It's new territory for me.
My valentines are|usually met with heartfelt restraining orders.
She'll love it.
I wish dating was like slaying - simple,|direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss.
Sorry to say, Xand.
|Slaying is a tad more perilous than dating.
Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia.
Wait up!
Hey, wait up!
Excuse me?
Where's the fire sale?
Oh, sorry.
Didn't see you.
You didn't call back last night|to talk about dance outfits.
I'm wearing red and black,|so you need to switch.
Red and black?
Is that what Xander likes?
- Xander?
What does he have to do with this?
|- Well, a girl wants to look good for her geek.
- Xander's just|- When'll you start wearing matching outfits?
Cos I'm planning to vomit.
Let's go.
Papers on my desk.
Anybody tries to leave without giving me|a paper is looking at a failing grade.
This time I'm ready for ya.
|No F for Xander today.
No, this baby's my ticket to a sweet D minus.
- Hey, Amy.
|- Hey.
You guys goin' to the|Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze?
- Go ahead, you know you wanna say it.
|- My boyfriend's in the band.
- Cool!
|- I think you've now told everybody.
- Only in this hemisphere.
|- What about you?
Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick|to sell cards and chocolate.
Bad break-up, huh?
Believe me when I say "Uh-huh".
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Amy.
I just hate to think of you solo|on Valentine's Day.
I'll be fine.
Mom and I'll have a pig-out.
It's a|time-honoured tradition among the loveless.
- Did you guys see that?
|- See what?
In class.
I think Amy worked|some magic on Miss Beakman.
- You mean like witchcraft?
|- Her mom's a witch.
An amateur psycho.
|Amy shouldn't be messing with that stuff.
- Maybe I should go talk to her.
|- Buffy?
Buffy?
- Might I have a word?
|- Have a sentence even.
- Oh, good.
Well|- Back it up before you leave.
- Rupert.
|- Ms Calendar.
I'm glad we ran into each other, actually.
|I was hoping that we could, uh Do you have a minute?
Actually, not just now.
Erm,|I have a matter to discuss with with Buffy.
Right.
Let's go.
Are you OK?
Me?
I'll I'll be fine.
Um, I was more concerned about you,|actually.
Since Angel, erm, turned, ..
I've been reading up|on his earlier activities.
You know, feeding patterns and the like.
And?
Around Valentine's Day he's rather prone to ..
well, erm, brutal displays of|he would think of it as affection, I suppose.
- Like what?
|- No no need to go into details.
- That bad?
|- Suffice it to say, I think it would be best ..
if you stayed off the streets for a few nights.
I'll, erm I'll patrol.
|You know, keep an eye on things.
Better safe than sorry.
It's a little late for both.
Fancy it, pet?
It's beautiful.
Nothing but the best for my gir Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.
Angel!
It's still warm.
I knew you'd like it.
I found it in a quaint little shopgirl.
Cute.
Here.
I'll get it.
Done.
I know Dru gives you pity access, ..
but you have to admit|it's easier when I do things for her!
You would do well to worry less about Dru, ..
and more about that slayer|you've been tramping around with.
Dear Buffy.
Hm.
I'm still trying to decide|the best way to send my regards.
Why don't you rip her lungs out?
|That might make an impression.
Lacks poetry.
It doesn't have to.
What rhymes with lungs?
Don't worry, Spike.
Angel always knows ..
what speaks to a girl's heart.
# Feelin' I've been lost for years # You can never understand me # Unless you've seen those tears # But you never get to sleep # When I'm away # I don't mind Oz has his cool hair today.
I think I'm a groupie!
Oh, hey!
Let's get outta here.
Here.
Mom?
Mom?
- Buffy, it's me.
|- Yeah.
You just startled me a little.
I was just checking the back door.
|Somebody left these for you.
# Hey!
# I can't sleep # Hey!
# I can't sleep # Hey!
# I can't sleep - Hey.
|- Your clothes.
You look so good.
Oh.
I let Buffy dress me.
- Well, not physically.
|- Perfect.
Had to make this harder, didn't you?
Clearly the fact I please you visually|has got us off on the wrong foot.
- Xander|- Let me finish.
I've been thinking a lot about us lately.
The why and the wherefore.
You know, once, twice.
|A kissy here, a kissy there.
And you can chalk it all up to hormones.
And maybe that's all we have here -|tawdry, teen lust.
But maybe not.
Maybe something in you sees something|special inside me, and vice versa.
I mean, I think I do.
See something.
So Xander.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
I wanna break up.
OK, not quite the reaction I was lookin' for.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's just Who are we kidding?
|Even if parts of us do see specialness, ..
we don't fit.
Yeah.
OK.
Do you know a good day to break up with|somebody?
Any day besides Valentine's Day!
I mean, what?
|Were you runnin' low on dramatic irony?
I know.
I didn't mean to do it this way.
Uh Well, you did.
Dude!
Way to get dumped!
- Buffy, my bud, you would not believe|- Can't talk right now.
Angel.
- Do you need help?
|- It's all right.
Gee, Xander, you should learn a second|language, so even more girls can reject you.
What are you doing?
Amy.
Good to see ya.
You're a witch.
No, I'm not.
|That that was my mom, remember?
Yeah.
I'm thinkin' it runs in the family.
|I saw you work that mojo on Miss Beakman.
- Maybe I should tell somebody.
|- That's not That is so mean!
- Blackmail is an ugly word.
|- I didn't say blackmail.
Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you,|so I thought I'd bring it up.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want some respect around here.
|I want, for once, to come out ahead.
I want the Hellmouth to be workin' for me.
You and me, Amy.
We're gonna cast a little spell.
- A love spell?
|- Yeah.
Just the basic.
Can't eat, can't sleep,|can't breathe anything but little old moi, Well, that kind of thing is the hardest -|to make someone love you for all eternity?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Back up.
|Who said anything about eternity?
A man can only talk|self-tanning lotion for so long.
I don't get it.
If you don't wanna be|with her for ever, what's the point?
I want her to want me, desperately,|so I can break up with her ..
and subject her to the same hell|she's been puttin' me through.
Oh, I don't know, Xander.
- Intent has to be pure with love spells.
|- Right.
I intend revenge.
Pure as the driven snow.
Now, are you gonna play, or do we need to|have another chat about invisible homework?
I'll need something of hers.
|A personal object.
Right.
"Soon" what?
You never held out on me|until the big, bad thing became my ex-honey.
- Where's this from?
|- He said it with flowers.
This isn't the time to be Mr Protective Guy.
I can't prepare|when I don't know what's coming.
No.
Of course.
You're right.
S-sit down.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not gonna make|a big scene.
I just want the necklace back.
- What?
I thought it was a gift.
|- Last night it was.
Today it's scrap metal.
- I figure I can melt it down, sell it for fillings.
|- You're pathetic.
Come on.
I'm not gonna add to|the Cordelia Chase Cast-Off Collection.
It's in my locker.
I can wait.
Here.
It's a good thing we broke up.
|Now I don't have to pretend I like it.
Diana, ..
goddess of love and the hunt, ..
I pray to thee.
Let my cries bind the heart|of Xander's beloved.
May she neither rest nor sleep ..
until she submits to his will only.
Diana, bring about this love and bless it!
Blow out the candle now!
Remember?
I don't remember.
- What?
|- Morning, ladies.
Some kind of weather|we've been havin', huh?
What do you want?
You can't be|sniffing around for more jewellery to melt ..
cos all you ever gave me|was that Smallmart-looking thing.
Is this love?
Cos maybe on you|it doesn't look that different.
What are you doing?
Are you going,|like, Stalker Boy on me now?
- Sorry, my mistake.
|- Yeah, I should say so.
What is his deal?
Oh, here's another.
Here.
Um, "Valentine's Day.
|Angel nails a puppy to the" - Skip it.
|- But I don't wanna know.
|I don't have a puppy.
Skip it.
Right you are.
I'll get another batch.
I have a plan.
- We use me as bait.
|- You mean make Angel come after you?
No, I mean chop me up and|stick me on hooks for fish to nibble at ..
cos it would be more fun than my life.
Yeah.
I heard about you and Cordy.
- That's her loss.
|- Yeah.
Not really the popular theory.
You know what I'd like?
Why don't you and I do something tonight?
|Just the two of us.
- Really?
|- Yeah.
We can comfort each other.
Would lap dancing enter into that scenario|at all?
Cos I find that very comforting.
Play your cards right OK.
Uh you do know that I'm Xander, right?
I don't know, I just ..
heard that you and Cordy broke up, and ..
I guess I was just surprised how glad I was.
It's funny how you can|see someone every day, ..
but not really see them.
You know?
Yeah, it's funny.
And it's just gettin' funnier.
Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, OK.
- Xander?
|- Yeah.
- I don't think the spell worked out.
|- It bombed.
No biggie.
Well, we can always try again.
|I am still pretty new at this.
Oh, no, no.
It's OK.
It was wrong to meddle|with the forces of darkness.
I see that now.
- I think we've all grown.
I gotta go.
|- We don't have to cast any spells.
We can just hang out.
Sure.
- What?
|- Well, I liked spending time with you.
You're so sweet.
It's funny how you can|see a person every day and Not really see them?
Exactly.
- So, anyway, I thought|- Hi, Xander.
- What?
|- You're in my history class, right?
- Yeah.
|- Maybe we could study together tonight.
Do you mind?
We were talking.
I really gotta go.
Right now.
Sorry.
I wanted to surprise you.
Good job!
High marks.
Don't be so jumpy.
|I've been in your bed before.
Yeah, but, Will,|we were both in footie pyjamas.
Xand, I've been thinking.
Will, I think I know what you've|been thinking.
But this is all my fault.
- I cast a spell and it backfired.
|- How long have we been friends?
A long, long time, Too long to do|anything that might change that now.
But friendships change all the time.
People grow apart.
They grow closer.
This is good - how close we are now.
I feel|comfortable with this amount of closeness.
In fact, I can even back up|a few paces and still be happy.
See?
I want you, Xander, - ..
to be my first.
|- Baseman?
Tell me we're talking baseball.
We both know it's right.
It's not that I don't find you sexy.
Is it Oz?
Don't worry about him.
He's sweet, but he's not you.
Yes, he is!
And you should go to him.
|Cos he's me!
I-I-I don't wanna use force.
Force is OK.
That's it!
This has gotta stop!
It's time for me to act like a man.
And hide!
Ha, very funny.
What did I do now?
|Wear red and purple together?
You know what you did.
|Xander is wounded because of you.
Are you tripping?
|You wanted me to break up with him.
Only a sick pup would let Xander get away,|no matter what her friends said.
What does it take to make you people happy?
# Yeah # Got the love, got the love # Mm, yeah # Got the love, got the love # Got the love, got the love # Sugar baby # Got the love, got the love # Oh, now, babe,|you been gone such a long time # Been thinkin' 'bout what it is we got # Not all the time in the world # Whoo!
# But we got a lot # Now, there's much more|than a ghost of a chance # We can make it # Right this time # Cos you got to stay mine # Yeah, I got the love # Got the love, got the love Xander.
- What is it?
|- It's it's me.
- Throwing myself at your mercy.
|- What?
Why?
I made a mess, Giles.
See, I found out that|Amy's into witchcraft, and I was hurt I guess.
So I made her put the love whammy|on Cordy, but it backfired.
Now every woman in Sunnydale wants me.
Which may sound swell on paper, but Rupert, we need to talk.
Hey, Xander.
Nice shirt.
Rupert, I know you're angry at me, and I don't|blame you, but I am not just gonna go away.
I mean, I care far too much about you to Have you been working out?
I cannot believe|you are fool enough to do this.
Oh, no.
I'm twice the fool it takes to do this.
Has, erm|Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?
All Amy wants to do|is talk honeymoon plans.
- Maybe I need to talk to Xander alone.
|- Do you have any idea how serious this is?
People under a love spell, Xander, are deadly.
They lose all capacity for reason.
And if what you say is true,|and the entire female population is affected Don't leave the library.
I'll find Amy|and see if we can put a stop to this thing.
No.
Alone at last.
- Buff!
Give me a heart attack.
|- Oh , ..
I'm gonna give you more than that.
Buff, for the love of God,|don't open that raincoat.
Come on, it's a party.
Aren't you gonna open your present?
It's not that I don't want to.
Sometimes|the remote possibility you might like me ..
was all that sustained me.
But not now.
Not like this.
This isn't real to you.
|You're only here because of a spell.
I mean, if I thought you had one clue|what it would mean to me But you don't.
So I can't.
So you're saying this is all a game?
A game?
I No!
You make me feel this way|and then you reject me?
What am I, a toy?
- Buffy, please calm down.
|- I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
Get away from him.
He's mine.
Oh, I don't think so.
- Xander, tell her.
|- What?
I uh He doesn't have to say.
|I know what his heart wants.
Funny.
I know what your face wants.
What is this?
You're two-timing me?
!
Goddess Hecate, work thy will.
Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
Buffy!
Oh, my God!
- Wh-what just happened?
|- Buffy.
Where where is she?
- Oh, my God!
|- Why is she here?
Can you focus for a minute?
|You just turned Buffy into a rat!
Buffy can take care of herself.
- Why don't we go someplace private?
|- Can you I'm not going anywhere|until you change her back.
You heard him.
So why don't you|undo your magic trick and get lost?
Who made you queen of the world?
Well, you're old enough to be.
Well, what can I say?
I guess Xander's|just too much man for the pimple squad.
Goddess Hecate, to you I pray - ..
with this|- Quit with the Hecate!
OK, what now?
|You don't like my locker combination?
It's just not right.
|You never loved him.
You just used him.
- You make me sick.
|- OK, Harmony, ..
if you need to borrow my Midol, just ask.
You two, sit!
Be quiet.
We have to catch the Buffy-rat.
Ooh, there!
Good, Buffy.
Just - That kinda hurt.
|- Kinda?
What was that for?
I was on the phone all night|listening to Willow cry about you.
Now, I don't know exactly what happened,|but I was left with the strong urge to hit you.
- I didn't touch her, I swear.
|- Xander!
Where's Buffy?
Amy turned her into a rat.
I don't see her.
|If anything happens to her, I'll Oh, just go home.
Lock yourself away.
You're|only going to cause more problems here.
Um, Amy,|Jenny and I will try and break the spell.
Oz, if you could aid us in finding, erm|Buffy?
Sure.
Absolutely.
- If|- Just go.
Get out of my sight.
Buffy?
What are you doing?
|You guys are crazy!
You thought you could do better?
- We'll knock that snotty attitude out of you!
|- No!
Argh!
You must have botched the ritual so that|Cordelia's necklace actually protected her.
It should be reversible.
|Where did you learn animal transformation?
Why did you send Xander away?
|He needs me.
- That's a laugh.
|- He loves me.
We see into each other's souls.
No one can love two people at once.
- What we have is real.
|- Instead of making me ill, help me.
- You have no idea what I'm going through.
|- I know it's not love!
It's obsession - selfish, banal obsession.
Xander has put himself in danger.
If you cared about him, you'd help save him|rather than wittering on about your feelings.
Now, let's get on with some work.
|Now, Jenny Great.
I think we - ..
lost 'em.
|- I should have known I'd find you with her.
- Will.
Come on, you don't wanna hurt me.
|- Oh, no?
You don't know how hard this is for me.
|I love you so much.
I'd rather see you dead than with that bitch!
- OK, now I really think we've lost 'em.
|- Dammit, what's going on?
- Who died and made you Elvis?
|- Buffy's house.
Get inside.
I'll explain later.
- Come on!
|- Xander?
Cordelia?
Yeah.
Hi.
What happened?
|Why are you all scratched up?
- Where's Buffy?
|- She's, um ..
around.
Well, sit down and tell me about it.
Why don't you run upstairs and|grab some bandages out of the bathroom?
Let me, uh, get you something to drink.
You in the mood for cold or hot?
I-I I think it's more of a hot night, don't you?
- Whatever.
|- You are so tense.
Mmm.
- What are you doing?
Make me yak!
|- Cordelia, go upstairs.
This is between us.
- Gross.
I think not.
Let's go.
|- What are you doing?
Hey, get your hands off me!
And keep your mom-aged mitts|off my boyfriend.
Former!
Why has everyone gone insane?
Insane?
Is it so impossible for you to believe|that other women find me attractive?
The only way to get girls|to want you would be witchcraft.
That is such a Well, yeah, OK.
Good point.
Oh, my God!
Xander, honey, let Joycie in.
|Hon, let Joycie in.
- Upstairs!
Buffy's room!
|- Sweetheart?
Good.
The mob still hasn't found us.
|We should be safer up here.
Works in theory.
Xander!
- Where's Buffy?
|- Cordy, get outta here!
Perfect.
I wanted to do something special for Buffy.
|Actually, to Buffy.
But this is so much better.
If it's any consolation,|I feel very close to you right now.
- Buffy, how?
|- Don't fret, kitten.
Mummy's here.
I don't know what you're up to,|but it doesn't amuse!
If you harm one hair on this boy's head You've gotta be kidding.
Him?
Just because I've finally found a real man.
- I guess I really did drive you crazy.
|- Your face is a poem.
I can read it.
Really?
It doesn't say|"Spare me" by any chance?
How do you feel about eternal life?
We couldn't just start with a coffee?
A movie maybe?
- There he is!
He's mine!
|- Get off!
All you had to do was love me!
No!
Get out of the way!
Get off him!
Back off!
Ah, sorry, Dru.
Guess you're not invited.
It's never gonna work for us, Xander.
|We have to end it.
Here, Buffy.
Right.
Go on.
You first.
- Xander!
|- Gimme a nail.
If we die in here,|I'm gonna kick your ass.
I mean it.
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't|dumped me - but no, you're so popular!
Me?
I'm not the one who embraced the|black arts just to get the girls to like me.
Well, congratulations.
It worked.
It would've worked fine, except your hide's|so thick not even magic can penetrate it!
You mean the spell was for me?
Xander, let me touch you!
Goddess of creatures great and small,|I conjure thee to withdraw.
Hecate, ..
I hereby license thee to depart.
Buffy?
- Oh, my God!
|- Stay behind me.
Xander!
I need you.
Come here, please!
Erm, Diana, ..
goddess of love, begone.
Hear no more thy siren's song.
Get off!
Get off me!
What's going on?
Where am I?
What's going on?
- Hi, Oz!
|- Hi.
I seem to be having|a slight case of nudity here.
But you're not a rat, ..
so call it an upside.
- You think you could get me some clothing?
|- Yes, I can.
Just, uh, don't go anywhere.
Really not an issue.
What What did we?
Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever!
- "Scavenger hunt".
|- Your mom seemed to buy it.
So she says.
She's so wigged at hitting on|one of my friends that she's repressing.
She's getting good at that.
|I should probably start worrying.
Well, I'm back to being incredibly unpopular.
- Better than everyone trying to murder you.
|- Mostly, but, uh ..
Willow won't even talk to me.
- Any particular reason she should?
|- How much grovelling are we talking?
Oh, a month, at least.
Xander, come on.
|I mean, this is worse for her than anyone.
She loved you before you invoked|the great roofie spirit.
The rest of us - You remember, huh?
|- Oh, yeah.
I remember coming on to you.
|I remember begging you to undress me.
And then a sudden need for cheese.
I also remember that you didn't.
- Need cheese?
|- Undress me.
- It meant a lot to me, what you said.
|- I couldn't take advantage of you like that.
- OK, for a minute it was touch and go there.
|- You came through.
- There might just be hope for you yet.
|- Tell that to Cordelia.
You're on your own there.
- Cody Weinberg called me last night.
|- Cody Weinberg?
- The one with the 35OSLO?
|- The very one.
He's thinking of asking me|to the pledge dance.
- That's so huge!
|- Yeah!
There's just two other girls he's gonna ask|first, and if they refuse, then Watch it!
Sorry.
God!
I'm glad your mom stopped working at|the drive-through long enough to dress you.
Oh, that reminds me.
|Did you see Jennifer's backpack?
- It is so trying to|- Harmony, shut up!
- Do you know what you are?
You're a sheep.
|- I'm not a sheep.
You're a sheep.
All you do is what everyone|else does, just so you can say you did it first!
Here I am scrambling for your approval when|I'm way cooler than you cos I'm not a sheep.
I do what I wanna do|and I wear what I wanna wear.
And you know what?
|I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date.
No matter how lame he is.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
- It's gonna be OK.
Just keep walkin'.
|- Oh, God, what have I done?
- They're never gonna speak to me again.
|- Sure they are.
If it helps, when we're around them,|we can fight a lot.
- You promise?
|- You can pretty much count on it.

and we obey, What other choice do we have?
- He was in my room.
|- Who?
Angel.
He was in my room last night.
- Are you sure?
|- Positive.
When I woke up,|I found a picture he'd left me on my pillow.
- A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.
|- I thought vampires had to be invited in.
Yes, but once you've invited them in,|then they're always welcome.
There may be a lesson for you gals about|inviting strange men into your bedrooms.
Oh, God!
I invited him in my car once.
That means he can come into my car|whenever he wants.
You're doomed to having to give him|and his vamp pals a lift whenever they want.
And those guys never chip in for gas.
There has to be some sort of spell|to reverse the invitation.
Like a barrier - a "no shoes,|no pulse, no service" thing?
- Yeah, that works for a car, too?
|- Yes, well, I can check on my Hello?
Have you ever heard of knocking?
We're supposed to get some books.
- On Stalin.
|- Does this look like a Barnes & Noble?
- This is the school library, Xander.
|- Since when?
Uh, yes.
Third row, historical biographies.
Thanks.
What?
Oh Hey, did you say that was the?
Hello?
So, Angel has decided|to step up his harassment of you.
By sneaking in her room|and leaving stuff at night?
Why doesn't he just slit her throat or strangle|her while she's sleeping or cut her heart out?
I'm trying to help.
Yes.
Look, it's classic battle strategy|to throw one's opponent off his game.
He's just trying to provoke you.
To taunt you.
To goad you|into some mishap of some sort.
The nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah|approach to battle.
Yes.
Once more you've managed to boil|a complex thought down to its simplest form.
Angel once told me that when|he was obsessed with Drusilla, ..
the first thing he did was to kill her family.
- Your mom|- I know.
I have to tell her something.
- The truth?
|- No, you can't do that.
The more people who know,|the more it cheapens it for us.
I've gotta tell her something.
Giles, Angel has|access to my house and I'm not always there.
- I can't protect her.
|- I told you, I will find a spell.
- What about until you find a spell?
|- You are welcome to ride with me in my car.
Buffy, I understand your concern, but|it's imperative that you keep a level head.
That's easy for you to say.
You don't|have Angel lurking in your bedroom.
I know how hard this is for you.
OK, I don't.
But as the Slayer, you don't have|the luxury of being a slave to your passions.
You mustn't let Angel get to you,|no matter how provocative he may be.
So what you're basically saying is|just ignore him and maybe he'll go away?
- Precisely.
|- How come Buffy doesn't get a snotty ..
"once again you boil it down|to the simplest form" thing?
Watcher's pet!
I need your sample spreadsheets|by the end of the week.
And I want both a paper printout|and a copy on disk.
Thank you.
- Willow.
|- Yes?
Uh, I might be a little late tomorrow.
Do you|think you could cover my class till I show?
Really?
Me?
Teach the class?
Sure!
- Cool.
|- Wait.
What if they don't recognise my authority?
What if they try to convince me|that you always let them leave early?
- What if there's a fire drill?
Or a fire?
!
|- Willow you're gonna be fine.
- And I'll try not to be too late, OK?
|- OK, good.
Earlier is good.
Will I have the power to assign detention?
|Or make 'em run laps?
- Hey, Will.
|- Hey, Buffy.
Rupert.
I thought I might take in a class.
I could|use someone who knows where they are.
Sorry.
I have to talk to her.
Teachers are to|be respected, even if they're only filling in, ..
because otherwise chaos could ensue.
How have you been?
Uh, not so good, actually.
Since Angel lost|his soul, he's regained his sense of whimsy.
- That sounds bad.
|- He's been in Buffy's bedroom.
I need to drum up a spell|to keep him out of the house.
This might help.
I've been doin'|a little reading since Angel changed.
- I don't think you have that one.
|- Thank you.
So how's Buffy doing?
How do you think?
- I know you feel betrayed.
|- Yes, that's a side effect of betrayal.
Rupert I was raised by the people|that Angel hurt the most.
My duty to them|was the first thing I was ever taught.
I didn't come here to hurt anyone.
And I lied to you because|I thought it was the right thing to do.
I didn't know what would happen.
I didn't know I was gonna|fall in love with you.
Oh, God Is it too late to take that back?
Do you want to?
I just wanna be right with you.
I don't expect more.
I just want so badly|to make all this up to you.
I understand.
But I'm not the one you need to make it up to.
Thank you for the book.
OK What's wrong?
- It's nothing.
|- Come on, you can tell me anything, I've read all the parenting books.
|You cannot surprise me.
Do you remember that guy Angel?
Angel?
The, um the college boy|who was tutoring you in history?
Right.
He I Oh, God.
Um We're sort of dating.
Were dating.
Going through a serious|"off again" phase right now.
Don't tell me.
He's changed?
|He's not the same guy you fell for?
In a nutshell.
Anyway, since he changed,|he's been kinda following me around.
- He's having trouble letting go.
|- Buffy, has he done anything?
No!
No, it's not like that.
He's just been hanging around.
A lot.
|Just sending me notes, that kind of thing.
I just don't wanna see him right now.
|I mean, If he shows up, I'll talk to him.
Just ..
don't invite him in.
I agree with Giles.
You need|to just try and not let him get to you.
Angel's only doing this to try|to get you to do something stupid.
I swear, men can be such jerks sometimes.
|Dead or alive.
I just hope Giles|can find a keep-out spell soon, I know I'll sleep easier|when I can sleep easier.
I'm sure he will.
He's, like, Book Man.
Until then, try and keep happy thoughts and And what?
Willow?
Willow?
Thanks for having me over, Buffy.
|Especially on a school night an' all.
No problem.
Hey, sorry about your fish.
It's OK.
We hadn't really had time to bond yet.
Although, for the first time, I'm glad|my parents didn't let me have a puppy.
It's so weird.
Every time something like this happens,|my first instinct is still to run to Angel.
I can't believe it's the same person.
He's|completely different from the guy I knew.
Well, sort of, except Except what?
You're still the only thing he thinks about.
I brought something for you.
Poor thing.
She's an orphan.
Her owner died ..
without a fight.
Do you like her?
Mm?
I brought her especially for you,|to cheer you up.
And I've named her Sunshine.
Open wide.
Come on, love.
You need to eat something|to keep your strength up.
Now open up for Mommy!
I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru!
Why not?
She already bathes you, carries|you around and changes you like a child.
Why, Angel, where have you been?
The sun is almost up and it can be so hurtful.
- We were worried.
|- No, we weren't.
You must forgive Spike.
|He's just a bit testy tonight.
Doesn't get out much any more.
Well, maybe next time|I'll bring you with me, Spike.
It might be handy to have you around|if I ever need a good parking space.
Have you forgotten|you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
And as a guest, if there's|anything I can do for you, ..
any responsibility I can assume|while you're spinning your wheels - Anything I'm not already doing, that is.
|- That's enough!
You two boys ..
fighting over me an' all ..
makes a girl feel - Dru, what is it, pet?
|- The air ..
it worries.
Someone, an old enemy, is seeking help.
Help to destroy our happy home.
Welcome.
How may I serve you today?
Love potion?
|Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful I need an orb of Thesulah.
You're in the trade!
Sorry|about the spiel, but around Valentine's Day ..
I get a lot of tourists shopping for love|potions and mystical revenge of past lovers.
Sad fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet,|that's what pay the rent around here.
- So how'd you hear about us?
|- My Uncle Enyos told me about you.
So you're Janna, then.
|I'm sorry to hear about your uncle.
- Thank you.
|- He was a good customer.
Well, there you go.
One Thesulan orb:|spirit vault for the rituals of the undead.
I don't get many calls for those lately.
Sold a couple as|New Age paperweights last year.
I just love those New Agers.
|They helped to send my youngest to college.
By the way, you do know the transliteration|annals for the Ritual of the Undead were lost?
Without the annals, the text is gibberish.
And without a translated text, the orbs of|Thesulah are pretty much useless.
I know.
I mentioned it because|I have a policy of no refunds.
It's OK.
I'm working on a computer program ..
to translate the Romanian to English|based on a random sampling of the text.
Ugh!
I don't like computers.
- They give me the willies.
|- Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
By the way,|not that it's any of my business, ..
but what are you planning on conjuring up|if you can decipher the text?
- A present for a friend of mine.
|- Really?
What are you gonna give him?
His soul.
Good morning.
|What did you two do last night?
We had kind of a "pyjama party|sleepover with weapons" thing.
I don't suppose you had the presence of mind|to locate a camera to capture the moment?
I have to go.
I have to teach in five minutes.
I have to arrive early to glare|disapprovingly at the stragglers.
Oh, darn.
She's here.
Five hours of lesson planning|yesterday down the drain.
You know what?
I'll see you in class.
- Hey.
|- Hi.
Is there something that?
|Did you want something?
Look, I know you feel badly about|what happened and I just wanted to say Good.
Keep it up.
- Don't worry, I will.
|- Wait.
He misses you.
He doesn't say anything to me,|but I know he does.
And I don't want him to be lonely.
I don't want anyone to.
Buffy, you know that|if I have a chance to make this up We're good here.
Let's just leave it.
It was here somewhere.
Oh, that's it.
|Could you hang those up?
Thank you.
Buffy.
So how was your night?
Sleepless, but no human fatalities.
I found a ritual to revoke|the invitation to to vampires.
Thank goodness!
I actually had to talk my|grandmother into switching cars last night.
The ritual's fairly basic.
|It's the recitation of a few rhyming couplets, ..
burning of moss herbs,|sprinkling of holy water - All stuff I have in my house.
|- Hanging crosses - I'll have a hard time explaining this to Dad.
|- You really think it'll bother him?
Ira Rosenberg's only daughter|nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall?
I have to go to Xander's house|just to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas, - I see your point.
|- It is worthwhile ..
to see him do the Snoopy dance!
Willow, are you aware that|there are no fish in your aquarium?
Cordelia, we've already done your car.
- Call it a night, if you want.
|- Right.
Thanks.
And you know I'd do the same for you|if you had a social life.
This must be for you.
It's for you.
Mom.
Mrs Summers, I need to talk to you.
You're Angel.
- Did Buffy tell you about us?
|- She wants you to leave her alone.
- Oh, I can't.
I can't do that.
|- You're scaring her.
You have to help me.
Joyce, I need to be with her.
You can|convince her.
You have to convince her.
Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone.
You have to talk to her for me.
|Tell her I need her.
Please, look, I just want to get inside, OK?
You don't understand, Joyce.
I'll die without Buffy.
She'll die without me.
- Are you threatening her?
|- Please!
Why is she doing this to me?
I'm calling the police, now.
I haven't been able to sleep|since the night we made love.
I need her.
I know you understand.
Just leave us alone.
"..
verbis consensus recisus est, " Sorry, Angel.
I've changed the locks.
Hello?
Hey.
- You're working late.
|- Special project.
I spoke to Buffy today.
Yes?
She said you missed me.
Well, she's a meddlesome girl.
Rupert OK, I don't want to say anything if I'm wrong,|but I may have some news.
I need to finish up here.
|Could I see you later?
Yes, yes You could stop by my house.
OK.
Good.
Sorry, honey.
We're closed.
- What do you want?
|- Miss Sunshine tells me you had a visitor.
But she worries.
She wants to know what you|and the mean teacher talked about.
Come on.
Come on.
That's it.
It's gonna work!
This will work.
Angel.
- How did you get in here?
|- I was invited.
The sign in front of the school: "Formatia trans sicere educatorum, " "Enter all ye who seek knowledge".
What can I say?
I'm a knowledge seeker.
Angel, I've got good news.
I heard.
You went shopping at|the local boogedy-boogedy store.
The orb of Thesulah.
If memory serves, this is supposed|to summon a person's soul ..
from the ether.
Store it until it can be transferred.
You know what I hate most|about these things?
They're so damn fragile.
Must be|that shoddy, gypsy craftsmanship, huh?
I'm amazed how much the world has|changed in just two and a half centuries.
It's a miracle to me.
You put|the secrets to restoring my soul in here!
It comes out here!
"The Ritual of Restoration".
Wow.
This This brings back memories.
- Wait, that's your|- My cure?
No, thanks.
Been there, done that Déjà vu just isn't what it used to be.
Boy, isn't this my lucky day?
The computer ..
and the pages.
Looks like I get to kill two birds ..
with one stone.
The teacher makes three.
Oh, good.
I need to work up an appetite first.
Sorry, Jenny.
This is where you get off.
I never get tired of doing that.
- Willow.
Good evening.
|- Hi.
Come on in.
- Here's the book.
|- Right.
I should do my apartment tonight.
- Did the ritual go all right?
|- Yeah, it went fine.
Well, it went fine until Angel showed up|and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had Well, you know.
That they had you know.
- You do know, right?
|- Oh!
Yes, yes, sorry.
Oh, good.
Because I just realised that,|being a librarian, maybe you didn't know.
No, thank you.
I got it.
You would have been proud of her, though.
|She totally kept her cool.
OK, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by.
Well, do you Perhaps I should intervene|on Buffy's behalf with her mother?
Maybe say something?
Sure.
Like, what would you say?
- You will tell Buffy I dropped by?
|- You bet.
That stuff with the Latin and the herbs,|he's just real superstitious.
- We just thought if|- Was he the first?
No, wait.
I don't want to know.
|I don't think I want to.
Yeah, he was the first.
I mean, the only.
- He's older than you.
|- I know.
Too old, Buffy.
|And he's obviously not very stable.
I really wish I just thought you would|show more judgement.
He wasn't like this before.
Are you in love with him?
- I was.
|- Were you careful?
- Mom, this is no time|- Don't "Mom" me!
.
You can't get out of this.
You had sex with a|boy you didn't even tell me you were dating!
- I made a mistake.
|- Don't just say that to shut me up - ..
because I think you really did.
|- I know that!
- I can't tell you everything.
|- How about anything?
Buffy, you can shut me out of your life.
|I am used to that.
But don't expect me to ever stop caring|about you, because it's never gonna happen.
I love you more than anything in the world.
That would be your cue to roll your eyes|and tell me I'm grossing you out.
You're not.
Oh, well I guess that was "the talk".
So how'd it go?
I don't know.
It was my first.
Hello?
Jenny?
It's me.
# Sei mia # V'aspettan gli amici # Già mi mandi via?
# Vorrei dir, ma non oso # Di'!
# O soave fanciulla # O dolce viso di mite circonfuso alba lunar # In te ravviso # Il sogno ch'io vorrei sempre sognar!
# Ah, tu sol comandi, amor!
# Le dolcezze estreme # Tu sol comandi, amor!
Mr Giles, I need to ask you to come with us.
Just to answer a few questions.
Of course.
Yes.
Procedure.
I need to make a phone call, ..
if that's all right?
Passion is the source|of our finest moments: ..
the joy of love.
..
the clarity of hatred ..
and the ecstasy of grief, Giles?
Really?
No No!
- Where's Giles?
|- No luck.
By the time I got to the station, he'd left.
|They just wanted to ask some questions.
- Will you drive us to Giles' house?
|- Of course.
Don't you think he wants to be left alone?
I'm not worried about what he wants.
|I'm worried about what he's gonna do.
Hello?
Giles?
I guess Giles had a big night planned tonight.
Giles didn't set this up.
Angel did.
This is the wrapping for the gift.
Oh, man.
Poor Giles.
- All his weapons are gone.
|- But I thought he kept them at the library.
No, those are his everyday weapons.
These were his good weapons, the ones|he breaks out when company comes to visit.
- So he's not here?
|- Then where is he?
- He'll go to wherever Angel is.
|- That means the factory, right?
- So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel.
|- It's about time somebody did.
- Xander!
|- Sorry, but I hated Angel long before you did.
I deserve something for not saying|"I told you so" before now.
If Giles wants to go after|the fiend that murdered his girlfriend, ..
I say "Faster, pussycat.
Kill, kill"!
- You're right.
|- Thank you.
Only one thing wrong|with Giles' revenge scenario.
- And what's that?
|- It's gonna get him killed.
Are you insane?
We're supposed to kill the bitch,|not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.
But, Spike, the bad teacher|was going to restore Angel's soul.
What if she did?
If you ask me, I find myself|preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus.
Because this new, improved one|is not playing with a full sack.
I love a good slaughter|as much as the next bloke.
But his little pranks will only leave us|with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer.
Don't worry, Roller Boy.
|I've got everything under control.
Whatever happened to wooden stakes?
Uh-uh.
No fair going into the ring|unless he tags you first.
All right.
You've had your fun.
But you know what it's time for now?
My fun!
Gonna let your old man just burn?
Why did you come here?
|This wasn't your fight!
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
You can't leave me!
I can't do this alone.
It hurts sometimes|more than we can bear, If we could live without passion,|maybe we'd know some kind of peace.
..
but we would be hollow: ..
empty rooms, shuttered and dank, Without passion.
..
we'd be truly dead, In my years as Watcher, ..
I've buried too many people, ..
but Jenny was the first I've loved.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you, ..
for her, ..
when I had the chance.
I wasn't ready, But I think I finally am, Hi.
Principal Snyder asked me|to fill in for Ms Calendar ..
until the new|computer-science teacher arrives.
So, I'm just gonna stick to|the lesson plan she left.
I can't hold on to the past any more, Angel is gone, Nothing's ever gonna bring him back,
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Non-vampire, plus two.
Hi.
Man, Buffy.
My whole life just flashed|before my eyes.
I gotta get me a life.
- What are you doing here?
|- What are you doing here?
- I'm patrolling.
|- Buffy, you're sick.
No, I feel fine.
I mean, the world's spinning|a little bit, but I like it.
It's kinda like a ride.
Half the school's out with this flu.
|It's a serious deal.
We're all concerned|about how gross you look.
I'm touched.
Really.
But I have work to do.
Buffy, come on.
|One night of rest is not gonna kill you.
- No.
But it might kill somebody else.
|- You mean Angel might.
Buffy, this is not the time to challenge Angel.
- He's at full strength.
You're half a slayer.
|- But I'm still the Slayer.
As long as I am,|Angel's not gonna kill anybody else.
Ah, come on!
Just one more.
Not feeling well, lover?
That helped.
You know, you being off your game's|taken the fun out of all this.
Nope.
Still fun.
Uh-oh.
|This does not look good for our heroine.
Take a walk, overbite.
We'll have to do this again sometime.
Buffy, are you OK?
I told you guys to leave.
I I Buffy?
!
Buffy?
- We need help!
|- Somebody, please!
What happened?
- The flu, fainted and fell.
She's sick.
|- It's gonna be OK.
Let's get her up.
The patient's unconscious.
|Pupils are unequal and unresponsive.
- Is she gonna be OK?
|- Please, give us some room.
- What do we have?
|- High-grade fever, possible fractures.
Get her into Trauma One.
Give her a CBC,|chem seven, type and screen.
- I'm sorry.
You can't go any further.
|- Someone should be with her!
I'll call Giles.
Call Buffy's mom.
Tell her|not what happened.
Just get her here.
- Where is she?
|- She's still in the emergency room.
- I wanna see her.
|- They won't let us in.
- Ms Summers?
|- I'm Dr Wilkinson.
- Is Buffy OK?
|- We were able to stabilise - Is she OK?
|- She's going to be fine.
- Thank you.
|- Good.
Good.
That's good.
I wanna keep her here a few days, though.
|She still has some healing to do.
Buffy?
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Buffy.
We're all here.
Hey.
Here we are.
It's all of we.
Are we taking me home?
No.
Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.
Uh lie at home.
My bed is better|than any bed that's not my bed.
- She's still a little out of it.
|- Shh.
Hospital zone.
No singing.
- She'll feel better after being here a while.
|- No.
Let me go.
I wanna go.
- No!
No!
Let me go!
Stop it!
|- Hold her steady!
Giles, tell them!
The vampires!
|I need to kill the vampires!
This'll help you relax.
- No!
No!
|- Easy.
- Gotta be the fever.
|- It made her delusional.
- They're out there!
|- Yes, we'll, er ..
we'll get those vampires later.
- I hear it's best to play along.
|- Honey, listen - I wanna go home.
|- It's gonna be OK.
I promise.
- Please don't make me stay here.
|- I promise.
That was a new experience.
|I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared.
Yeah.
She just hates hospitals.
- Since she was a little girl.
|- What happened?
When she was eight,|her cousin, Celia, died in a hospital.
- Buffy was alone with her at the time.
|- Yuck.
- Yeah.
They were very close.
|- When she was eight?
Well, it looks like she's asleep.
|I should go call her father.
Erm, I think there's a phone.
Thank you for coming.
I really appreciate|the way you look out for her.
All of you.
We're, er, we're very fond of her.
|The, er the telephone.
I, I I hope I'm not out of line, but ..
I wanted to say how sorry I am|about that teacher, Ms Calendar.
Buffy said you were close.
Thank you.
Buffy's been so down since it happened.
|I mean, she never gets sick.
I'm sure she'll be she'll be fine.
I'm sorry.
I I babble when I'm nervous.
|I just wanted to Well, if you need anything.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- D'you think she's gonna be OK?
|- I don't know.
Lysette got her nose done here.
|She came in for the Gwyneth Paltrow - ..
and it looked more like the Mr Potato Head.
|- Cordy.
Buffy's not in here for cosmetic surgery.
No, but while she's in here,|she might as well get that thing done.
You know, that thing on her face?
- You know that thing.
|- Do you think Angel will attack Buffy here?
- He can come in.
It's a public building.
|- That's true.
Am I the only one that's noticed that thing?
Is that better?
Man, I hate it when you lose the young ones.
I'm just saying, step back on the|dosage until we can analyse the results.
There isn't time.
|That should be clear to you.
- The normal course of treat|- They aren't responding.
They're worse.
- Raising their temperature|- Dr Wilkinson, - ..
I have the consent of the parents.
|- They're desperate.
If you have a problem with my methods,|speak to the board.
I have.
He comes at night.
|The grown-ups don't see him.
He was with Tina.
He'll come back for us.
- Who?
|- Death.
Visiting hours are over.
- Well, I'm pretty much family.
|- Yeah.
Why don't you come back during the day?
|Oh, gee, no.
I guess you can't.
If I decide to walk into Buffy's room,|do you think for one microsecond ..
that you could stop me?
Maybe not.
|Maybe that security guard couldn't either.
Or those cops.
Or the orderlies.
But I'm kinda curious to find out.
You game?
Buffy's white knight.
You still love her.
It must just eat you up that I got there first.
You're gonna die.
And I'm gonna be there.
Tell her I stopped by.
Help me!
Help!
Avalanche!
|Help!
Help!
I'm trapped!
- Avalanche!
Help!
|- Power Girl to the rescue!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
- You saved me!
Thank you, Power Girl!
|- You're safe now.
Good morning.
- Could've fooled me.
|- How are you feeling?
- Looks like your fever's gone down.
|- Oh, good!
Thanks for having me.
- Let's try and keep in touch.
|- Not so fast.
- Hmm|- Good "hmm" or bad "hmm"?
.
- The swelling's gone.
Does this hurt?
|- No.
- Amazing.
|- Then I should probably go.
No.
Soon.
We have to make sure|that fever is gone.
That's a strong virus you have.
|Maybe not as strong as you, but Is that the same virus the kids have?
May we come in?
Please.
Maybe you can keep|our patient from bolting.
Rest.
Hmm?
Flowers for milady.
- I think they call those balloons.
|- Yeah, stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow.
Not to be outdone.
- Homework?
|- It's my way of saying "get well soon".
You know, chocolate says that even better.
I did all your assignments,|so all you have to do is sign your name.
Chocolate means nothing to me.
Nobody told me I was supposed to bring|a gift.
I was out of the loop on gifts.
It's traditional among, erm people.
Erm Grapes.
Well, did you pass the night well enough?
Not really.
Something happened|I thought you You know what?
Let's take a walk.
- Now this part I could get used to.
|- Do you want me to go real fast?
- Not that I would.
|- You were discussing, erm, stuff?
Yes, stuff.
Um - You know a girl died here last night.
|- How?
Well, the flu.
- Flu?
Doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
|- I know.
But there's this Dr Backer, and he's been|giving them these experimental treatments.
I'm not sure what he's up to,|but he's a little creepy.
Then there was this kid, Ryan.
|He said he saw something.
- Saw what?
|- Death.
- Death?
|- The Death?
As in "It is your time"?
- Buffy, a frightened child|- But I thought I saw something.
- I'm not sure.
I was really out of it, but|- But you do know that you saw Death?
- Did it have an hourglass?
|- If he asks you to play chess, don't do it.
- The guy's like a whiz.
|- Maybe it wasn't Death.
- Maybe it was something else.
|- This isn't about being afraid of hospitals ..
cos your friend died and you wanna|conjure up a monster you can fight ..
so you can save everybody|and not feel so helpless?
- Cordelia, have you ever heard of tact?
|- Tact is just not saying true stuff.
I'll pass.
- Your mom did tell us about your cousin.
|- This has nothing to do with that.
This little boy, Ryan, is afraid of something.
|Something real.
As long as I'm forced to stay here,|I'm gonna find out what.
So is this the part where we say|"What can we do to help"?
You had to ask that, didn't you?
It'll be cake.
We just gotta figure out|what killed this little girl, Tina.
We'll be out.
Five minutes, tops.
This is what happens when|you're compassionate to sick people.
They take advantage of you.
Uh-huh.
|Buffy almost died just to put you out.
I didn't want to be the first one to say it.
- You there.
Me here.
|- Right.
What are you doing here?
- So, where do we start?
|- Hmm?
Oh, I don't know.
Er, maybe look into|the history of the hospital, - ..
bizarre incidents, that sort of thing.
|- I'm sensing less than full committal here.
I suppose so.
Cordelia may be Homerically insensitive,|but she may also be right.
Death and disease are things - possibly|the only things - that Buffy cannot fight.
It's only natural for her to try to create|a defeatable opponent.
Especially now, after ..
after Jenny.
That's true, but on the|"we live on the Hellmouth" side, ..
these kids may have seen a monster.
Well, a a monster that grown-ups can't see?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Unless|- Unless?
Sometimes small children|do see something we adults don't.
Us.
Our true selves.
Our our hidden faces.
So, the kids might be afraid|of a regular person?
- Like the weird doctor.
|- Stanley Backer was his name, no?
Let's look him up.
Most people think that security guards|are just guys that failed the police exam.
But that's not me.
This is my career.
Stereotypes are so unfair.
I did take the fireman's exam, though.
|I didn't do so good.
Oh, well, you know, I think that security|guards are way sexier than firemen.
They're all sooty.
Well, this is where all the action is, anyhow.
|I'm all the time restraining people.
Hmm.
How thrilling.
Do you ever get scared?
"Fear is for the weak".
That's my motto.
Either that, or "Live in the now".
|I haven't decided yet.
I bet you see a lot of tragedy.
|You know, like that little girl.
Oh, one of Dr Backer's patients.
|Dr Backer's a great man.
He understands the real truth about children.
- What's that?
|- Sometimes they die.
What was that?
Uh, you know, I didn't hear anything.
|You know, you have the most ..
perfect nose I've ever seen.
You must work out.
Yeah.
Could you make just a little more|with the touchy-gropey?
- Jealous?
|- Of Rogaine Boy?
- I don't think so.
Here, take this to Giles, OK?
|- What about you?
- I'm gonna stay here.
|- Your obsession with protecting Buffy.
Have I told you how attractive that's not?
- Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back.
|- Yeah, I've seen you watch her back.
- What is that supposed to mean?
|- I was using the phrase "watch her back" ..
as a euphemism for looking at her butt.
|You know, sort of a pun.
Oh.
Right.
- Hey!
|- Well, you do.
Jealous?
Fine.
Watch my back.
Hey.
Remember me?
- You shouldn't be here.
|- Why not?
- Contagious.
|- Nah.
I already got what you got.
What?
You think because I'm a grown-up?
|Believe me, I'm not that grown-up.
He'll come again tonight.
Ryan, listen to me.
I'm not gonna let this thing hurt you.
|Any of you.
Grown-ups don't believe you, right?
I do.
|We both know that there are real monsters.
But there's also real heroes|that fight monsters.
And that's me.
You can't fight Death.
Well, Dr Backer|has something of a rap sheet.
Reprimands for controversial experiments,|risky procedures, a malpractice suit Looks like it was dropped suddenly.
Factor in Buffy's observation|that he gives her the, erm, wiggins.
This may be our death guy?
I just wish I knew|what he was doing to these children.
Yes Yes.
- Well, it looks as if you were onto something.
|- I know.
The, uh, the girl, Tina, erm It's apparent|that she died of the fever, simple enough.
But her records show her improving|and then suddenly deteriorating ..
without any apparent cause.
So we checked Dr Backer out.
|This guy was not a solid citizen.
It wasn't Backer.
He was clean.
- What do you mean, clean?
|- What do you mean, was?
He's dead.
This thing killed him,|and not with kindness.
- You saw it?
|- No, it's invisible.
I saw Backer nearly shredded|and then it knocked me down.
But it's real.
Which means I get to fight it.
Er this is your work?
- No.
One of the kids.
|- Oh, er Erm well,|it would help if we knew what it was.
It's invisible to you,|but the children can see it.
- You did see something the other night.
|- I was delirious.
It doesn't make any sense.
- Why would I see it then and not last night?
|- Good morning.
Ooh, looks like I interrupted a secret meeting.
You sure didn't.
Honey, I just talked to the doctor|and she said I can take you home.
No.
I should stay here.
- But I thought you'd be ready|- I think my symptoms are flaring up.
- She doesn't look well.
|- Cos I'm not well.
I feel all ooky.
Increased ooky-ness.
That's a danger signal.
- Are you sure?
|- Oh, yeah.
But just for a day or so.
OK, well, I'll, uh..
I'll talk to the doctor.
So, what's the drill?
Giles, see if you can get a mug shot.
|I need to know what I'm fighting.
- Right.
|- I'll check Backer's office.
See if I can find any Post-its marked|"Why a monster might want me dead".
Sounds like a plan.
If I find anything,|I won't know what it means, so, Will Oh, yeah, I'm good at medical stuff.
|Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.
No.
She's being literal.
She had these medical|volumes, and diagnosed me with stuff.
I couldn't tell her she was playing it wrong.
Wrong?
Why?
How did you play doctor?
I never have.
Erm fascinating though this is Yeah.
Right.
Go.
- We'll call you if we know something.
|- Know something soon.
I'd best head to the library.
|Research beckons.
I'm on sentry duty.
|Angel won't show till sundown, if at all.
- Maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy.
|- He's invisible.
Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe|and a smoking jacket, he's dropped.
- You two stay alert.
|- Finding out who this thing is takes priority.
- Cordy, you should go with Giles.
|- Why do I have to have Good thinking.
|I could do with a research assistant.
Let's go, Tact Guy.
Yes.
Be careful.
It's weird going through his things.
Look.
He didn't finish his coffee.
- Guess he won't.
|- Yep.
Another person I wasn't in time to save.
It's too bad Angel didn't put me|in the hospital sooner.
There's something|I never thought I'd hear myself say.
- Hey, wait.
I think I have something.
|- Mm.
Sherlock.
OK, this makes sense.
Dr Backer was trying to inoculate the kids ..
with a controlled dosage|of the same virus they already had.
Raising their temperatures|to burn the fever out of them.
- Would that work?
|- According to this, it was starting to.
- So he really was trying to help the kids.
|- Until that thing stopped him.
Eww!
What does this do?
- What?
|- What does this do?
Er, it, er, extracts vital organs|to replenish its own mutating cells.
Wow!
What does this one do?
Erm, it elongates its mouth to engulf|its victim's head with its incisors.
Ouch.
Wait, what does this one do?
It asks endless questions while it's supposed|to be working so nothing is getting done.
Boy, there's a demon for everything.
I don't even know if we're on the right track.
Since this, er, miscreant has only been seen|by select individuals, ..
there's a chance|we won't ever find a picture of it.
Well, it's not in here.
- It's called "Der Kindestod".
|- Who is this?
- It's me.
I've got your monster.
|- Where's Giles?
- Looking up stuff.
|- Well, can you put him on?
- Hey, I found your guy, OK?
Just listen.
|- Right.
The name means "Child Death".
It says that he feeds off of children|by sucking the life out of them, Ugh!
But anyway, afterwards, it looks like|they died because they were sick.
- So, it did kill Tina.
|- That's my take, Cos it would be looking at the children's|ward as an all-you-can-eat kind of thing.
Backer was curing the kids|and taking away its food.
- Hence the sliceage.
|- I got a picture of how it kills.
Let me talk to - Oh, eww!
|- What?
Oh!
You should see this thing!
|The way it does its thing, I mean eww!
Why do I let you guys|drag me into this stuff?
- Buffy?
Are you still there?
|- Hanging on every "eww".
Erm, the, erm The Kindestod gorges by sitting atop|his prey, pinning it down helplessly.
Then he slowly draws out the life, It must be horrifying for the victim, Buffy?
Hello?
Celia?
What's wrong?
I don't know what to do, Celia!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Come on, Celia!
Buffy, what is it?
Thanks.
- It killed Celia.
|- Your cousin?
We have to get this thing.
|Before it gets any more kids.
- You will.
We will.
|- But how?
I can't even see it.
- You saw it once.
|- Did I?
Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.
|I was crazed with that fever.
Who knows - Buffy, think about this.
|- I have.
Lots of thoughts.
- It's crazy.
|- The fever.
It's how you see the Kindestod.
That's why Celia could see it.
|That's why Ryan still can.
It's the only way.
But how are you gonna fight this thing|with a 100° temperature?
- I guess we'll find out.
|- Buffy!
I'm going to do this.
Buffy, that's 100 per cent pure.
|It'll kill you in an instant.
Oh.
They really should put that on the label.
It needs to be diluted.
OK, but this better work fast.
Faster than that.
Here's to my health.
Oh, God.
|I'm not sure this was such a good idea.
- Hang in there.
You'll be OK.
|- OK.
I'm OK.
The kids.
They're gone.
Come on!
Hurry!
Keep quiet!
- What could've happened?
|- I don't know.
Maybe we're too late.
Maybe they moved.
Maybe I don't|I'm burning up.
- Will?
|- What?
I think it's in there.
He's going after them!
We've gotta get him.
- OK, we'll get him in a second.
|- What's wrong?
- Uh, uh she's not feeling well again.
|- You should be in bed.
- No, it's not that bad.
|- No, you're coming with me.
She's sorry.
Security.
Come to the children's ward.
|We have a situation.
OK, come on, now.
|We can do this the easy way.
Frogs!
Frogs!
Get 'em off of me!
|Oh, my God!
Frogs!
Get them off of me!
Please help!
Get 'em off!
Frogs!
Frogs!
- Oh, my God!
Horrible frogs!
Get 'em off!
|- Not her!
The other one!
- No more frogs.
|- Come on!
- Buffy, are you OK?
Did Angel?
|- No.
We need to get to the basement.
Come on.
- It's cold.
|- Here.
- Here.
We're gonna be safe in here.
|- Look out!
What?
Oh!
- You don't know how to kill this thing?
|- I thought I might try violence.
Solid call.
Help!
You make me sick.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Are you OK?
Actually, I think I'm starting to feel better.
Let's Oh.
He's dead, right?
I heard something snap.
- That would be his neck.
|- You're not gonna yak on me, are ya?
Here you go, honey.
Peanut butter and jelly.
|Without the crust.
- Just the way you like it.
|- And the juice?
- Two parts orange, one part grapefruit.
|- That's my drink.
I measured it exactly.
Oh, Mom?
- I wanted crunchy peanut butter.
|- Oh.
Sorry.
And I said extra jelly.
Anything to help my daughter get well.
Oh, and while you're up, could I get a refill?
|It's just, I'm so comfortable.
- Of course.
|- Thanks.
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
|And another bag of Chee-Zee chips.
- Uh, you ate the last one.
|- Another bag's hidden behind the raisins.
I'm on it.
Your mom's trying to bogart|the Chee-Zee chips.
What's that all about?
Oh, Buffy.
Here.
Um, this came in the mail.
- It's from Ryan.
|- The boy from the hospital?
Oh, he drew you a picture.
How ..
nice.

# The way you love # Have you got a name for it?
# Cos I don't understand # It # The language is an annoying necessity # And I depend on all the regular things # Got a list tattooed on my memory # Of how our tryst should unfold Hey.
I'm Ben.
We had Algebra II together last year?
I'm sorry, I pretty much repress|anything math-related.
Miss Jackson?
Second period?
You sat|in the seat three over and one behind.
Oh!
I remember now.
It's the one with|the desks, chalkboards and pencils, right?
- That's the one.
|- Like a steel trap.
So, I was wonderin',|you know the dance tomorrow night?
- Are you goin'?
|- The Sadie Hawkins thing?
- The deal where the girls ask the boys?
|- Yeah.
And I thought maybe, you know,|if you're free, you might ask me.
Oh, gosh - I|- Don't worry No, you seem like a really great guy.
It's me, I I'm not seeing anybody.
- Ever again, actually.
|- Oh.
That's that's too bad.
OK, well, I better Sorry.
# I'm falling from the opposite # What good is it?
# Fight the map with no key attached # My heart's enlarged and I charge Hey.
You're bailin'?
Yeah.
I'm gonna stop by the library and see|if Giles wants me to patrol, and then sack it.
You've been doing that a lot -|patrolling and sacking.
In fact, you've kind of been|"All work and no play Buffy".
I play.
I have big fun.
|I came here tonight, didn't I?
You came, you saw, you rejected.
You mean that guy?
|I'm just not in date mode right now.
- Maybe you need to date to get in date mode.
|- I don't think I'm ready for that, Will.
You're thinking too much.
|Maybe you need to be impulsive.
Impulsive?
Remember my ex-boyfriend, the|vampire?
I slept with him, he lost his soul, ..
now he's gone for ever and the demon|with his face kills my friends.
My next impulsive decision|will be my choice of dentures.
OK, the Angel thing went badly - I'm|on board with that - but that's not your fault.
And anyways, love isn't always like that.
Love can be nice.
Come back here!
We're not finished!
- You don't care any more, is that it?
|- It doesn't matter what I feel!
Then tell me you don't love me.
Say it!
Will that help?
Is that what you need to hear?
I don't.
I don't!
Now let me go.
No!
A person doesn't just wake up one day|and stop loving somebody.
Love is for ever.
I'm not afraid to use it.
I swear!
- If I can't be with you|- Hey!
Oh, my God!
Don't walk away from me, bitch!
- What happened?
|- What happened?
!
You just went OJ on your girlfriend.
This is nuts.
I-I|I don't know why I got so mad.
- Because you're a jerk?
|- He's not.
- We weren't fighting a few minutes ago.
|- We weren't.
I swear to God.
Then why'd you have a gun?
I don't I don't know.
|I don't even know where I got it.
I don't see any gun.
I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
- To thank me?
|- That's right, I wanna thank you.
What would Sunnydale High do without|you around to incite mayhem and disorder?
I don't incite!
I stopped that boy from|killing his girlfriend.
Ask him.
Ask the janitor.
People can be coerced, Summers.
|I'm no stranger to conspiracy.
I saw JFK, I'm a truth seeker.
I've got a missing gun|and two confused kids on my hands.
Pieces of the puzzle.
I'm gonna look|at the pieces carefully and rationally, ..
and I'm gonna keep looking until I know|exactly how this is all your fault.
Mr Snyder, Crandle's chained himself|to the snack machine, Pathetic little no-life vegan.
Not so fast, missy.
|I'm not done with you yet.
You stink of lies.
So, for next time read the chapters on|information grouping and binary coding.
I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool.
If you find multi-stacked conversions|and primary-number clusters a big hoot!
Giles!
I made them laugh.
Did you hear?
- I did the joke thing!
|- Yes, yes, so it seems.
I mean, erm er you did indeed.
|Good good show.
I just stopped by to|to see if you needed any assistance, ..
but you seem to have things|quite under control.
Well, I had good lesson plans.
Ms Calendar had them on her computer.
Yes, yes, she was very, erm dedicated.
And I found a bunch of files and Internet sites|on paganism and magic and stuff.
- Oh?
|- Yes.
It's really interesting.
And, uh I found this in her drawer.
She told me it was a rose quartz.
|And it has healing powers.
I thought she'd want you to have it.
Oh, thank you, Willow, that's erm ..
that's very thoughtful of you.
Before 1935, the New Deal focused on|revitalising stricken business ..
and agricultural communities.
It also tried to regulate|the nation's financial hierarchy ..
to avoid another disaster|like the 1929 stock market crash.
Don't forget your assignments|are due on Friday, class.
I told Miss Hall we'd go help|decorate the gym.
Who are you taking?
- David said yes.
|- Oh, you're kidding!
He's so dreamy!
Thank you.
Thank you, James.
How are you enjoying|that book I loaned you?
- The Hemingway.
|- I like it.
Very much.
It's honest.
Yes, it's, um ..
it's based on a true story, actually.
He fell in love with his ..
hours, ..
child labour ..
and collective bargaining.
- Oh, my God!
|- Did you see what he wrote?
I'm telling you, something weird is going on.
"Something weird is going on" -|isn't that our school motto?
Pretty much.
But I don't know.
|This time it bugs me.
I don't wanna pooh-pooh your wiggins,|but a domestic dispute, ..
a little case of chalkboard Tourette's?
|All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to me.
Xander, what happened?
Did Cordelia|win another round in the broom closet?
You're just a big bucket of funny, Will!
I'll have you know I was just accosted|by some kind of, um locker monster.
- Loch Ness Monster?
|- Locker monster, he said.
Not a monster, an arm that came out of the|locker.
When we opened it again - nothing.
Right after Buffy's teacher|did a freaky channelling thing in class.
Ooh!
Sounds like paranormal phenomena.
- A ghost?
Cool!
|- Oh, no, no.
No.
No cool.
This was no wimpy chain rattler.
This was|"I'm dead, and I won't take it any more".
Despite the Xander-speak,|an accurate definition of a poltergeist.
I defined something?
Accurately?
- Guess I'm done with the book learning.
|- So we have some bad boo on our hands?
- Yes.
|- Why is it here?
Does it wanna scare people?
He doesn't know exactly what he wants.
|That's the trouble.
See, many times the spirit is plagued|by all manner of worldly troubles.
Being dead, it has no way to|to make its peace.
So, it lashes out, growing ever more|confused, ever more - ..
angry.
|- So it's a normal teenager.
Only dead.
What can we do?
|Is there any way to stop it?
The only tried and true way is to work out|what unresolved issues keep it here ..
and, erm resolve them.
- Fabulous!
We're Dr Laura for the deceased.
|- Only if we can find out who the spirit is.
Or was.
- Working late, Miss Frank?
|- I let myself get behind.
Is it OK to walk here, George?
|It is George, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Go ahead.
|- Thanks.
Have a nice evening.
- You, too.
Drive safe.
Oh, Miss Frank?
|- Yes?
You can't make me disappear|when you say it's over.
There's no way we can be together.
No way people will ever understand.
|Accept it.
Is that what this is about?
|What other people think?
No!
I just want you to be able|to have some kind of a normal life.
- We can never have that.
Don't you see?
|- I don't give a damn about a normal life.
I'm going crazy not seeing you.
- I think about you every minute.
|- I know but But it's over.
It has to be.
Come back here!
We're not finished yet!
- You don't care any more?
Is that it?
|- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter what I feel.
|- Then tell me you don't love me.
Say it!
Will that help?
Is that what you have to hear?
I don't.
I don't!
- Now let me go.
|- No.
A person doesn't just wake up one day|and stop loving somebody.
Love is for ever.
I'm not afraid|to use it, If I can't be with you Don't walk away from me, bitch!
I need you, Jenny.
Don't!
Don't do that, dammit!
|Don't talk to me like - What's going on?
|- What's going on?
!
You just shot a woman.
And this, ..
this is the garden.
Wow!
Look.
Jasmine.
- Night-blooming.
|- Like us.
Oh, Angel it's fairyland.
It's paradise.
Big windows, lovely gardens.
It'll be perfect|when we want the sunlight to kill us.
If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go.
|Take a stand, man.
Well, our old place was just fine|till you went and had it burned down.
Things change, Spikey.
|You gotta roll with the punches.
Well, actually, you pretty much|got that part down, haven't you?
Very funny, mate.
What can I say?
I just love to see you smile, buddy!
Yeah you're a giver.
It was just like the couple Buffy encountered -|the janitor remembered everything.
He knew he'd killed this poor woman,|but he had no idea why.
Well, they they had no intimate relationship.
- What about the gun?
Did you find it?
|- No.
No.
No, the police, everybody,|we searched high and low.
- I think it's clear what's happening.
|- Fill me in, then.
Cos I've read the book, seen the movie,|and I'm still fuzzy about it all.
It's Jenny.
- What?
|- You think she's the ghost?
Don't you see?
She she died here under|tragic circumstances, and now she's trapped.
But what about the gun?
|I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms Calendar.
That's insignificant.
It's the violence|of the thing that matters.
I don't know.
These fights these couples|keep having, it's sort of specific.
She's right.
It's a pattern|that doesn't fit with the way she died.
Yes, well, I, er I appreciate|your thoughts on the matter.
In fact, I ..
well, I encourage you to always, er|challenge me when you feel it's appropriate.
You should never be cowed by authority.
Except in this instance,|when I am right and you are wrong.
This is freaky.
I don't remember|ever seeing Giles be this weird.
He's usually "Investigate things|from every boring angle" guy.
Now he's "I cling on to my one lame idea"|guy.
What gives?
He misses her.
He can't think.
- Just a little more fallout from my love life.
|- OK, but this ghost stuff is something else.
I'll do a crosscheck|on shootings at the school.
We need alternate ghost theories.
|What do we know?
Dog spit is cleaner than human.
- Besides that?
|- Oh, boy!
We know plenty.
A student murdered a teacher|on the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
The rumour was they had an affair,|and she tried to break it off.
After he killed her, he went into|the music room and shot himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost.
|It is one of those two?
- It all fits: the gun, the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
|- Which is tonight.
Why have we never heard about this before?
|When did it happen?
How did you know?
Here's the new strangeness.
I dreamt about|this woman, Grace Newman, the other day.
- Her and this guy.
|- James Stanley?
He's the one.
He did it.
Your dreams are getting|wicked accurate, Buff.
You haven't seen me|come across some big cash?
Or possibly knowing the love of a woman?
|In a full body sense?
He couldn't make her love him,|so he killed her.
Sicko.
He looks so normal on this picture.
|He was smart, too.
He made the honour roll.
- Smart?
|- He killed a person and himself.
Pretty much two of the dumbest things|you could do.
I know, but|Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them?
Sure I feel lousy.
For her.
|He's a murderer and should pay for it.
- With his life?
|- No, he should be doing 60 years in prison, ..
making special friends|with Roscoe the weightlifter.
Yikes!
The quality of mercy is not Buffy.
Whose ghost do you think|we're dealing with?
His or hers?
Well, considering how violent it is,|I'm gonna say his.
That tracks.
I've been browsing|on some of Ms Calendar's pagan sites.
Maybe I can find a way to communicate|with him, and we can find out what he wants.
Who cares?
We need to shut him down before|another innocent guy kills a nice girl ..
and then blows his brains out|in the music room.
OK!
Who's hungry?
Next, please.
Move along.
I hope you're not going to the dance tonight,|cos I'm organising a boycott.
Do you realise that the girls have to ask|the guys?
And pay and everything?
- Whose genius idea was that?
|- Obviously some hairy-legged feminist.
Really?
We need to nip this thing in the bud.
|Otherwise, things are going to get scary.
They're everywhere!
Perfect.
I'm gonna be scarred and swollen.
|Why didn't they just kill me?
- Schoolboy pranks?
|- Never sell.
- The sewer got backed up.
|- I can probably make that one fly.
- This is getting out of hand.
People talk.
|- You'll take care of it.
I'm doing all I can,|but you people have to realise - What's going on here?
|- Backed-up sewer line.
Same thing happened|in San Diego just last week.
We're on a Hellmouth.
Sooner or later people will figure that out.
The city council was told|you could handle this job.
If you feel that you can't, perhaps|you'd like to take that up with the Mayor.
I'll handle it.
I will.
Remember the plan to contact the spirit|and talk to it?
Scrap that plan.
Buffy was right.
The time for touchy-feely|communication has passed.
I've done some homework and found out|the only solution is the final solution.
Nuke the school?
- I like that.
|- Not quite.
Exorcism.
Are you crazy?
I saw that movie.
|Even the priest died!
- What's the deal?
|- OK.
See here, the balcony?
That's where the original teacher died|back in 1955, and that teacher last night.
That's the hot spot where|all the bad mojo is coming from.
- We need to create a Mangus tripod.
|- A what?
One person chants here on the hot spot.
And the other three chant in other places|around the school, forming a triangle.
It's supposed to bind the bad spirit|and keep it from doing any more harm.
Well, I'll take the hot spot.
|If there's trouble, that's where it'll be.
This ghost, this James guy, is fixating|on you, Buffy.
The dreams, the yearbook You sure you can handle it?
Well, I'm hoping he'll show.
I truly am.
OK, we have our places.
We chant and light|candles at midnight exactly.
Any questions?
Yeah.
What if this mangled triangle thingy|doesn't work?
Oh!
I almost forgot.
I made us all scapulars.
OK.
So we can flip the ghost over|when it turns a nice golden brown?
Scapular, not spatula!
Um you wear it around your neck|for protection.
I have to wear this?
|It smells like grandpa breath.
I didn't have a lot of time.
|I had to use sulphur.
Stinky, but effective.
OK, let's do this.
This will be a piece of cake.
Maybe I'll sleep underground.
Dig myself a little burrow.
What about your pretty dress, sweet?
|It'll get all dirty.
- Then I'll sleep naked.
Like the animals do.
|- You know, I'm suddenly likin' this plan.
Fortunately,|nobody cares what you like mate.
Oh, yeah?
Let's ask Dru.
There's a gate!
- It's opening!
|- Incoming!
I love when she does this.
- What gate, pet?
What do you see?
|- It's black.
It wants her.
- Wants who?
|- The Slayer.
It's time, Angel.
She's ready for you now.
She's dancing.
- Dancing with death.
|- Big deal.
He won't do anything.
Our man Angel here likes to talk, but he's|not much for action.
All hat and no cattle.
I don't know about that.
I think this whole Slayer thing|has run its course.
I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
- Really?
|- Oh, yeah!
What, with you being Special Needs Boy,|I figure I should stick close to home.
You and Dru can always use|another pair of hands.
God!
What are you doing here?
- You're not supposed to be inside.
|- What about you?
Erm, er I'm, I'm trying to, er I think I may be close to,|er contacting Jenny.
- What's that smell?
|- It's my scapular.
- Ah, right.
Did you use sulphur?
|- Yeah.
That's clever.
Well, er run along then.
There may be some, er|paranormal phenomena if I contact her.
You don't want to be in the line of fire.
OK.
Night.
# My love must be a kind of blind love # I can't see anyone but you Oh, yeah, baby!
It's snake-a-licious in here.
# The moon may # Be high # But I can't see a thing # In the sky # I only - Giles!
|- Willow!
Giles!
Giles!
- Where are you?
!
|- Please!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Stop!
|- Just calm down.
Get out!
- Are you all right?
|- Giles Jenny could never be this mean.
I know.
It's it's not her, is it?
I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
Oh!
Careful up here!
I shall confront and expel all evil I shall totally confront and expel all evil ..
out of marrow and bone ..
out of house and home -|never to come here again.
Oh, my God!
You all right?
Get back!
Check it.
I'd say school's out for good.
The good news is|none of you girls were shot.
We've established, based on|all the parallels and Buffy's visions, - ..
that it's James' spirit.
|- So what do we do, Giles?
About James.
He's reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins|Dance when he killed Miss Newman.
It's, it's common enough for a spirit|to do this - to recreate a, a tragedy.
Hey!
If Sunnydale High shuts down for ever,|do we automatically graduate?
But why?
What does he want?
- Actually, that's an interesting point.
|- He's, he's trying to ..
resolve the issues keeping him in limbo.
|What those are, I'm not He wants forgiveness.
Yes I imagine he does.
But when James possesses people, they|act out exactly what happened that night.
So he's experiencing|a form of purgatory instead.
I mean, he's doomed to kill his Miss Newman|over and over and over again, and - ..
forgiveness is impossible.
|- Good.
He doesn't deserve it.
To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy.
|It's not done because people deserve it.
- It's done because they need it.
|- No.
James destroyed the one person he loved|the most in a moment of blind passion, ..
and that's not something you forgive -|no matter why he did what he did.
No matter if he knows now|it was wrong and selfish and stupid.
It is just something|he's gonna have to live with.
He can't live with it, Buff.
He's dead.
OK.
Overidentify much?
I need you, So what do we do next?
Do we go in again?
Er, not now.
No, the, er ..
the spirit is too angry - too, too powerful.
No, we have to work out exactly how|and and if this thing can be defeated.
Hey, Buffy, are you?
Oh, God Giles!
She went back.
So, what now?
Not even a mega-vat|of Raid's gonna do the trick here.
I don't get it.
Is she trying to be|a big loner hero?
No.
I believe she's under the spirit's thrall.
|He's, he's calling her.
But why?
James needs her to re-enact what happened|on the night he killed Miss Newman.
He wants to change things,|make make a happy ending.
But it can't ever happen!
|It always ends the same, ..
which means Buffy just went in there|to get shot, Giles.
Yes.
But the school's deserted.
There's no way for James to ..
to play his part.
|There's no man inside for him to possess.
So Buffy should be safe|until we find a way to get her out.
In theory, yeah.
Fun fact about wasps.
They have no taste for the undead.
Hey, not that a sting would do me|any damage.
It's just tonight's special.
I wanted to look my best for you.
You're the only one.
The only person I can talk to.
Gosh, Buff.
That's really pathetic.
You can't make me disappear|just because you say it's over.
Actually I can.
In fact, ..
I just want you to have some kind of|normal life.
We can never have that.
I don't give a damn about a normal life!
|I'm going crazy not seeing you.
I think about you every minute.
I know.
But it's over.
It has to be!
Come back here!
We're not finished!
|You don't care any more?
Is that it?
It doesn't matter what I feel.
Then tell me you don't love me!
Say it!
Is that what you need to hear?
Will that help?
I don't.
- I don't.
Now let me go.
|- No!
A person doesn't just wake up|and stop loving somebody!
Love is for ever.
I'm not afraid to use it, I swear!
If I can't be with you Oh, my God!
- Don't walk away from me|- ..
bitch!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Don't make me!
All right.
Just You know you don't wanna do this.
Let's both ..
just calm down.
Now give me the gun.
Don't!
Don't do that, dammit!
Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid James.
# My love must be a kind of blind love # I can't see anyone but you - Grace!
|- Don't do this.
- But but I killed you.
|- It was an accident.
It wasn't your fault.
- It is my fault.
How could I|- Hush.
I'm the one who should be sorry, James.
You thought I stopped loving you,|but I never did.
I loved you with my last breath.
Shh No more tears.
Angel.
Everything seems normal.
|Not a snake, not a wasp.
- Yep.
School can open again tomorrow.
|- Explain to me again how that's a good thing.
I'm drawing a blank.
- Are you feeling any better?
|- James picked me.
I guess I guess I was the one he could relate to.
He was so sad.
Well, - ..
they can both rest now.
|- I still Part of me just doesn't understand|why she would forgive him.
Does it matter?
No.
I guess not.
You might want to let up.
They say|when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated.
I'm the one who was freakin' violated.
|You didn't have this thing in you.
What was it?
A demon?
- Love!
|- Poor Angel.
Let's go.
I need a real vile kill before sunup|to wipe this crap out of my system.
Of course.
We'll find you a nice toddler.
Want to come, pet?
No can do, Dru.
|I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels, ..
but we don't have much time.
|Gotta travel light.
Sorry.
Try to have fun without me.
Oh, I will.
Sooner than you think.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One, She alone will stand against the vampires,|the demons and the forces of darkness, She is the Slayer, # Gilded ghetto # Hollywood stained below It's a stupid idea|to have a victory party at the beach.
It's officially nippy.
So say my nips.
- I think it's festive.
A party with nature.
|- It's the team's choice.
It was their victory.
Team?
Swim team.
Hardly what I call a team.
The Yankees.
Abbott and Costello.
The A.|Now those were teams.
- Jealous?
.
|- No!
.
Yes, but "no" more than "yes".
I mean, look at that!
Dodd McAlvy.
|Last month he's the freak with jicama breath.
He wins a few meets|and inherits the cool gene?
Well, my cheerleading squad|wasted a lot of pep on losers.
It's time our school excelled at something.
- You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
|- We're number one!
Huh?
- Number one!
|- One!
Beautiful!
Isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's just so|- Eternal.
A true mother, giving birth to new life|and devouring old.
Always adaptable and nurturing, yet ..
constant and merciless.
Boy!
I was just gonna go with big and wet.
Me and some guys on the team|come out here once a week to train.
See, we swim against the current.
Funny.
That's how I feel most of the time.
So, Cameron Walker, you just won the state|semifinals.
What are you going to do next?
I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers.
|Get to know her.
- Hey, pause that tape for a second.
|- Hey, no pressure.
I just like being around you.
That's all.
- Somebody help me!
|- Yeah!
Jonny, you gotta hold your breath|longer than that to make the team!
Hey, somebody time him!
Hey!
Nice tat.
What, they ran out of Tweety Bird?
- What's your problem?
|- Had it coming to you, bro.
Chill, dude.
A bunch of us are gonna take|a night dip down the beach.
You in?
- Whatever.
|- Hey, let's get you a towel.
No!
Why don't you mind your own business?
|I can handle this without your help.
See?
It's fun to hang out with me.
Man, I can't believe Buffy.
Man, that girl gives me the creeps.
Oh, dude!
What is that foulness?
Hey, Dodd!
Dude!
OK!
Good pie charts, everyone.
Good.
- All good.
|- Thanks!
Nice.
Good.
Gage.
Your pie chart|is looking a lot like solitaire.
- With naked ladies on the cards.
|- What's your point?
No point.
Nice work in yesterday's meet, son.
|Now, let's go for it!
- Uh, hi there, sir.
|- Rosenberg.
- How's the class?
Everything in order?
|- Well, actually Great.
I've been talking to the board.
We're having trouble finding|a competent teacher this late in the term.
Can you continue subbing through finals?
Oh!
Sure!
I like teaching.
Isn't that nice?
|You're a team player and I like that.
A team player wants everyone on the team|to succeed, wants everyone to pass.
Well, yeah.
Sure.
I understand there's a problem|with Gage Petronzi.
Oh, good.
Then you know.
Well, yeah.
Besides the behaviour problem, he won't|do homework and his test scores are Well, actually he doesn't have any,|because he never shows up when we I'm not interested in any of that.
Why, when this school is about to win|its first state championship in 15 years, ..
would you slap a member of that team with|a failing mark that would force his removal?
- Is that how you show your school spirit?
|- Yes.
Well, I mean no.
I'm just trying to grade fairly.
Gage is a champion.
He's under|more pressure than the other students.
And I think we need to cut him some slack.
You're asking me to change his grade?
I never said any such thing.
All I'm suggesting is|that you recheck your figures.
And I think we'll find a grade more fitting|to an athlete of Gage's stature.
Perhaps something in a D?
Just like that?
|He actually told you to alter his grade?
Exactly.
Except for actually telling me to.
But he made it perfectly clear|of what he wasn't telling me.
That is wrong.
A big fat spankin' wrong.
It's a slap in the face to everyone who studied|hard and worked long hours to earn our D's.
I know you like to be the voice|of the common wuss, ..
but certain people are entitled|to special privileges - winners.
- That's the way the world works.
|- What about "all men are created equal"?
Propaganda spouted|by the ugly and less deserving.
I think that was Lincoln.
- Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
|- Actually, it was Jefferson.
- Kept slaves.
Remember?
|- Know what grates my cheese?
That Buffy's not here to share|my outrage about swim-team perks.
She's too busy being one of them, I don't know, a dolphin.
|A dolphin in the ocean.
Because, you know, when I'm in the vastness|of the ocean, it's it's like I'm never alone.
You ever hear of a woman|named Gertrude Ederle?
No.
No, I can't say that I have, Cam.
First woman to swim|the English Channel.
Same thing.
I mean, she would talk to it.
|She'd cary on entire conversations with it.
- Sometimes I do that.
I mean, once I was|- You know what, Cam?
Thanks.
I'd forgotten how nice it is to just talk, ..
or, in my case, listen,|without any romantic pressure.
Hey, I'm not about pressure.
|I just want you to be comfortable.
I'm comfy!
I'm so comfy,|I'm nodding off, actually, which is why Are you wearing a bra?
What?
Come on.
Tell me you haven't been|thinking about this ever since last night.
What I'm thinking about is|I should probably get out of this car.
- Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
|- Oh, it's not me I'm worried about.
You like it rough!
Oh, you broke my nose!
Agh!
I wasn't the attacker.
I was the attacked.
That's not how it looked to me.
I don't know what happened.
I mean, first|she leads me on, then she goes schizo on me.
- Lead you on?
When did I lead you on?
|- Oh, come on.
Look at the way she dresses.
- Coach.
|- How we doing, Cameron?
Coach Marin, how bad does it look?
Luckily, it's not broken, but sure as hell|it's gonna sting for a few days.
I mean our chances of winning|the state championship.
Can we still do it?
I'm gonna need Cameron back at 110%.
|He's my best swimmer now, with Dodd - What happened to Dodd?
|- That's none of your concern.
You'd better hope his nose|heals before the meet this Friday.
Walker, hit the steam room as soon as|you're done here.
Keep those sinuses clear.
- Take care of my boy, Ruthie.
|- I always do.
And you, try to dress more appropriately|from now on.
This isn't a dance club.
So I'm treated like the baddie just because|he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose.
And I don't have a scratch on me.
|Which hurts my case a little, ..
but he gets away with it because|he's on the swim team who, by the way, ..
have been acting like real jerks lately So, anything new with you guys?
Thank you for taking an interest.
Some remains were found on the beach|this morning.
Some human remains.
- Dodd McAlvy's remains.
|- Vampire?
No, he was eviscerated.
|Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
In other words, this was no boating accident.
Something ripped him open|and ate out his insides?
Like an Oreo cookie.
Well, except for, you know,|without the chocolaty cookie goodness.
Yeah.
Um, Principal Snyder has asked|the faculty to keep the news quiet for now, - ..
so as not to unduly upset students.
|- For "students", read "swim team".
- So, we're looking for a beastie.
|- That, uh, eats humans whole.
- Except for the skin.
|- This doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah, the skin's the best part.
|- Any demons with high cholesterol?
You'll think about that later, mister,|and you'll laugh.
OK, son.
I think you've had enough.
|Time to hit the shower.
Too much research.
Need beverage.
Hey!
Watch it!
Oh, forgive me, your swim teamliness.
- Loser!
|- Liking the nose, Cam.
Good look for you.
Meaning what?
Meaning Buffy must not be|on your list of privileges after all.
Man, I love it when you guys mess with her.
You're lucky I'm hungry.
Oh, the cafeteria's closed.
Not to me.
God!
What is that?
Grape.
Orange.
Orange.
Grape.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
No, no, no!
The mouth's a lot bigger!
And downward.
Like this.
With more teeth!
I'm doing the best I can.
Is that what you saw, Xander?
Yeah!
I think so.
- Pretty much.
|- Are you sure?
It was dark.
It went through|the window so quick.
- I was a little shocked when I saw it, and|- Go ahead.
Say it.
You ran like a woman.
- If you saw it, you'd run like a woman, too.
|- Buffy was right.
According to statistics, Dodd and Cameron|were the best swimmers on the team.
First and second, so if my theory's correct, ..
Gage Petronzi, the third-best swimmer,|would be the next item on the menu.
God!
This is so sad.
We're never|gonna win the state championship.
- I think I have lost all will to cheerlead.
|- Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
If these killings aren't random,|someone's out for revenge.
And someone brought forth this sea monster|from whence it came to exact that revenge.
From whence it came?
|I'm spending way too much time around you.
Who would hate the swim team|that much, though?
Besides me, I mean.
Willow?
Jonathan.
He was bullied by Dodd|the other day on the beach, remember?
He did say he could|take care of things himself.
- It's a good call.
You should question him.
|- Really?
Me?
I'll crack him like an egg.
Meanwhile, I think swimmer number three|might benefit from your ..
watchful eye and protection -|discreetly, of course.
- I'm on it.
|- What about me?
What can I do?
Well, you could go out to the parking lot|and practise running like a man.
So, Jonathan.
You tried out for the swim team twice|and never made it?
I'm asthmatic.
I couldn't keep up.
- You resented it, didn't you?
|- Maybe.
You hated being pushed around|by Dodd and the others.
- So?
|- So, you wanted revenge, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Yeah!
OK?
I did!
So you delved into the black arts ..
and conjured up a hell beast from the|ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.
- Didn't you?
|- What?
No!
I snuck in yesterday and ..
peed in the pool.
This is such a blow.
Sooner or later, the rest of my boys are|gonna find out.
How can I ask them to swim?
It's a terrible, terrible tragedy.
|We all feel your pain, Coach.
I don't know two finer boys|than Cameron and that other one.
But I know they'd want their friends|to go on and win that state championship.
- It's time to think about the team.
|- Hell, I don't have a complete team.
If we don't find someone by this afternoon's|tryouts, we won't be eligible to compete.
You'll find someone.
All he has to do|is wear a bathing suit, right?
# We wouldn't have to go through this # If you'd just let me finish # Stop cuttin' and jumpin' ahead # Yeah, if you'd just shut your pretty mouth # You'd save yourself some tears # If you came back from the bathroom # With somethin' on your shoe This "me and my shadow" act?
It's getting old.
What do you want from me?
Well, um ..
it's a little embarrassing.
|You see, I'm a swim groupie.
Oh yeah!
You know, there's just something about|the smell of chlorine on a guy.
Oh, baby!
OK!
OK!
OK!
Obviously, my sex appeal is on the fritz|today, so I'll just give it to you straight.
Something out there is making filets of|the populace and I think you might be next.
Uh-huh.
And you think that because?
Well, it's already attacked.
|It's already killed some people.
You're one twisted sister, you know that?
|Cam told me about your games.
Go find someone else to harass.
What a psycho bitch!
Man!
Gotta be talking about Buffy.
- How'd you know?
|- Uh, she and I ..
had this thing once.
|Biggest mistake of my life.
- Yeah, my condolences, dude.
|- She's a real head-tripper.
Tell me about it.
|Girl acts like she's God's gift.
- Who is she?
The Chosen One?
|- Exactly.
What she needs is for someone to really|knock her down off her notches.
- Yeah, that'd be sweet.
Anyone in mind?
|- You're in luck, my friend.
- Just so happens, I'm recruiting.
|- No!
Somebody!
Help!
Get him off me!
Help!
Why, Miss Summers!
You're beautiful!
Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
- No.
That was something else.
|- Something else?
!
Yeah.
Unfortunately, we have a lot|of something elses in this town.
Good night.
Hey!
Walk me home?
Swimmers!
Take position!
Keep the stroking up.
Keep it going.
|Keep it going all the way to the end.
All the way to the end.
Breathe deep.
Gage, are you with us or not?
|Come on, let's go!
- He spit it out?
I thought Angel liked blood.
|- He used to.
Maybe his eyes were too big for his stomach.
Maybe there was something in Gage's blood|Angel didn't like.
Say, for example, steroids.
- It would explain their behavioural changes.
|- And their winning streak.
So maybe whatever's in their blood|is what's attracting this creature to them.
- Any luck researching?
|- Zippo.
We couldn't find any sea demon|matching Xander's description.
Not that Chicken Little's|much of a witness, but Oh!
Oh, my!
Now that, girls, is my kind of Xander?
Xander?
!
What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm undercover.
|- You're not under much.
Go, before someone sees you|impersonating a member of the swim team!
- I tried out for the team last night.
I made it.
|- Really?
Yeah.
I can keep an eye on Gage|when Buffy can't.
When you're nude?
I meant to say changing.
Harris!
You can flirt on your own time.
Okey-dokey, coachie!
I'm dating a swimmer|from the Sunnydale swim team!
You can die happy.
- What about Jonathan?
Is he involved?
|- Oh, no.
He just sort of peed in the pool.
Don't you guys get claustrophobic in here?
|I mean, what's the deal?
You perspire a lot.
You can't breathe.
Or read.
I mean, I guess you could,|but the pages would probably get all wet.
You gotta love this undercover deal.
|20 minutes in a hot room with sweaty guys.
- Where's Gage?
|- Right behind me, putting his sneakers on.
Not the Velcro kind,|so give him a couple of extra minutes.
Tag.
You're it.
Oh, my God!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Gage?
I don't think that this|is going to need stitches, ..
but you might wanna have|your family physician take a look at it.
- How are you?
|- I'm definitely feeling the burn.
Well, the good news is that it would appear|that none of your team actually died.
But the bad news is they're monsters.
- How could this happen?
|- Are you saying you don't know?
Well, you work so hard, you start to win|suddenly.
You think it's just you.
You're inspiring the boys to greatness.
But|in the back of your mind, you start to wonder.
You never asked any of the boys|if they were taking anything?
Maybe I was afraid to.
- There.
|- Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon.
Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist,|depression, headaches.
- It's all there in the school medical records.
|- All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
Is steroid abuse usually linked with|"Hey, I'm a fish"?
There must be something else in the mix.
|But the point is, these boys were drugged.
Nurse Greenliegh treated every one of them.
|She must have known.
If steroids are that dangerous,|why would they do that to themselves?
They needed to win.
Winning equals trophies,|which equals prestige for the school.
You see how they're treated.
The discus throwers|got the best seats at crucifixions.
I'm breaking my nails|battling the forces of evil, - ..
and my teacher can't remember my name.
|- What's the drill?
Get Nurse Greenliegh?
- Let's throw the book at her!
|- She probably went home.
I think it can wait.
Xander, see if you can find out what they're|taking, or at least how they're taking it.
- Powders, pills, syringe?
|- I'm "looking around guy".
- What about you?
|- Giles loaded the tranquilliser gun.
We're going fishing.
I feel good!
Lovin' the swimmin'.
Had some carrot juice this morning.
|A little wheat germ mixed in with it.
Woke me right up.
Nothing like it, huh?
Breakfast of state champions.
You betcha.
OK.
So, when do we get our next dose?
- What do you mean?
|- Who's carrying?
I need a little something to improve|my performance.
Give me an edge.
Rrr!
The steroids.
Where are they?
- You're soakin' in it, bud.
|- Huh?
Aromatherapy.
It's in the steam.
This has got to stop, Carl.
|Those poor children.
Are you a quitter?
|No room for quitters in this team.
Do you understand what's happening?
|Listen to yourself.
I'm very close to perfecting this.
|We just need to adjust the mix.
Carl.
You can't be thinking|of continuing to expose these boys.
They're gonna be the best.
|I don't accept anything less.
They're gonna be monsters.
Carl, please.
Don't make it any worse.
|You've already lost three.
Lost?
Why, they're not lost.
- Carl!
What are you doing?
!
|- I'm just looking after my boys.
They may be out of the game right now,|but they're still a team.
And a team's gotta eat.
- Carl!
|- You quitter.
They're absorbing the steroid mixture|through the steam.
Not they.
We, Me!
We need to find an antidote, don't you think?
|The clock is ticking!
I wouldn't break out the tartare sauce yet.
It's not like you were exposed|more than once.
- Twice?
|- Three times a fish guy.
- What am I gonna do?
|- You, you, you!
What about me?
It's one thing|to date the lame unpopular guy, ..
but another to date|the creature from the Blue Lagoon.
Black Lagoon.
The creature|from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields.
And thank you so much for your support!
We'd better find the rest of the team and lock|them up before they find their inner halibut.
Yes.
Yes, good.
Uh, we also need to know|exactly what's in this, this steroid gas, ..
so that the hospital's toxicology lab|can develop an antidote.
- I'll talk to Nurse Greenliegh.
|- You're getting into this interrogation thing.
The trick is not to leave any marks.
On that note, I think I'm gonna|go have a little talk with our coach.
Somehow, I doubt all he's been giving|these boys is inspiration.
- You got some imagination.
|- Well, right now, I'm imagining you in jail.
You're in an orange suit,|and the guards are beating you up.
- You don't have any proof.
|- Tell me what's in the steam.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, ..
documents came into light ..
detailing experiments with fish DNA|on their Olympic swimmers.
Tarpon mako shark - But they couldn't crack it.
|- And you did ..
sort of.
Why?
What kind of question is that?
For the win!
To make my team the best they could be!
Do you understand we have a shot|at the state championship?
Do you understand that I don't care?
|It's over.
There's no swim team.
Boy, when they were handing out school|spirit, you didn't even stand in line, did you?
No.
I was in the line for shred of sanity.
Which you obviously skipped.
Get in the hole!
In!
Now!
- This isn't over.
|- In!
You think I don't care about my boys.
|But I do.
They count on me.
So, what, you're gonna feed me to 'em?
Oh, they've already had their dinner.
But boys have other needs.
No one.
Willow and Giles|must've rounded up the swim team.
- Does my neck look scaly?
|- Of course it looks scaly, - ..
the way you've been rubbing it dry.
|- I need to look in a mirror.
Wait here.
But feel free to come in|if you hear me scream.
Any gills yet?
Xander, what are you doing?
Xander?
Oh, my God!
Xander!
It's me - Cordelia.
I know you can't answer me, but God, this is all my fault.
You joined the swim team to impress me.
You were so courageous.
|And you looked really hot in those Speedos.
And I want you to know that I still|care about you, no matter what you look like.
And and we can still date.
Or, or not.
I mean|I understand if you wanna see other fish.
I'll do everything I can|to make your quality of life better.
Whether that means|little bath toys or whatever.
Uh, Cordy?
That's not me.
Aargh!
Oh, my God!
In you go.
Stay calm, chaps.
Either we'll find|an effective antidote, or, or, uh Just stay calm.
- Everyone's accounted for except Sean.
|- We can safely say we found Sean.
He was in the pool skinless-dipping.
- Where's Buffy?
|- She hasn't come back yet.
Great.
This is just what my reputation needs:|that I did it with the entire swim team.
- What's up, Coach?
|- Oh, Harris.
Uh - How you feeling?
|- A little dry.
Nothing a lemon butter sauce won't cure.
Where's Buffy?
Buffy, hurry!
Your hand!
Hold on!
Hold on!
- Thanks.
|- Just doing my part for our team.
Aargh!
Don't let go!
Hold me!
Hold me!
Aargh!
Grab my hand!
Boys Boys, uh, now Now, boys No.
I Those boys really love their coach.
I gotta take a make-up chem test at three.
And then I'm meeting some of the guys|for plasma transfusions at five.
- It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
|- The fun never stops with you.
Giles seems confident|that the treatments are gonna work.
Turning into a creepy-crawly wasn't on my|top ten list of things to do before I turn 20.
I want you to know that|you've really proven yourself to me.
You don't have to join the new team|next year if you don't want.
I'd be just as happy if you played football.
The people from Animal Control|have just left.
Our creatures have apparently|made a, a dash for it.
Um, so to speak.
Does that mean we have to hunt them again?
No, I don't think so.
|I don't think we'll see them any more.
- Where do you think they'll go?
|- Home.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
There's moments in your life that|make you, that decide who you're gonna be, Sometimes they're little subtle moments, Sometimes they're not, I'll show you what I mean, We'll be back when we've found a bit|more cash money!
Keep the girls warm!
Let's go.
Come on.
We'll sneak in|and take some of me father's silver.
He'll never miss it.
|He eats with his hands, the pig!
Why don't you rest right here?
So, ..
I'd ask myself, "What's a lady|of your station doing alone in an alley ..
with a reputation that this one has"?
- Maybe she's lonely.
|- In that case, I'd offer myself as escort, ..
to protect you from harm|and to while away the dull hours.
- You're very gracious.
|- It's often been said.
Are you certain you're up to the challenge?
Milady, you'll find that,|with the exception of an honest day's work, ..
there's no challenge|I'm not prepared to face.
Oh, ..
but you're a pretty thing.
- Where are you from?
|- Around.
Everywhere.
I never been anywhere myself.
|I always wanted to see the world, but I could show you.
- Could you, then?
|- Things you've never seen.
Never even heard of.
- Sounds excitin'.
|- It is.
- And frightening.
|- I'm not afraid.
Show me.
Show me your world.
Close your eyes.
Nice try.
I want you to get a message to Angel.
Tell him I'm done waiting.
|I'm taking the fight to him.
You got that?
|Need me to write it down for ya?
All right, I'll tell him myself.
I'm good.
Don't worry about me.
You don't have to patrol with me.
I had that guy under control|until he resorted to fisticuffs.
What is that?
Five vampires in three nights?
Yep, but no Angel.
Are you that anxious|to come up against him?
- I want it over with.
|- I hear that.
Oh, we'd better go.
|I haven't even started studying for finals yet.
Oh, yeah!
Finals!
Why didn't you let me die?
Look on the bright side.
It'll all be over soon.
Yes, my love.
It will.
Careful now!
Concentrate in this area.
There ya go.
Hello?
- Rupert Giles?
|- Yes.
- Doug Perren.
Thanks for comin'.
|- I was flattered to be asked.
I spoke with Lou Tabor and he told me|we had the best authority on obscure relics - ..
right here in Sunnydale.
|- Well, he may have exaggerated a little.
- Ah, this is the|- This is our baby.
Construction workers dug it up outside|of town.
Don't have a clue what it is.
Any ideas?
A few but none I'd care|to share until I can verify.
- You have carbon-dated it?
|- Results will be back in a coupla days.
I'll go out on a limb and say "old"!
Erm it certainly ..
predates any settlements we've read about.
- May I?
|- Yeah, sure.
I assume you've|you haven't tried to open it?
Open it?
I'll be damned!
I figured it was solid.
- What do you think is in there?
|- I don't know.
- Well, we won't know until we open it up.
|- Could I ask erm Would you wait?
I'd I'd like to translate the text.
|It might give us an indication of ..
what we'll find inside.
- You don't wanna be surprised?
|- As a rule, no.
All right.
You're the expert.
- But I'm pretty damn curious, though.
|- Yes.
Yes, so am I. - "Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him".
|- "No, wait.
I'm gonna kill you"!
"Die!
.
Die!
.
Die"!
.
"Mother?
.
" - Is that it?
|- That's it.
- Scene?
|- That's exactly how it happened.
I thought it was riveting.
I was|a little unclear about some of the themes.
The theme is, Angel's too much|of a coward to take me on.
And the other theme was "Buy American"|but it got buried.
- Are you ready to fight Angel?
|- I wish people would stop asking me that.
Yes, I'm ready.
I'm also willing and able.
|It's the one test I might actually pass.
Don't say that!
You'll pass everything.
|I'll get you through if I have to sweat blood.
Do you think you're likely to?
|Cos I'd like to be elsewhere.
- It was only metaphor blood.
|- I think you'd sweat cute blood.
After my computer class|we'll rock on chemistry.
- Ready to rock.
|- Willow, you've got the teaching bug.
- Taking over computer class, tutoring|- I love it, I really do.
It's great to do that before|you fail in the real world.
That way you're not falling back on|something.
You're falling well, forward.
And almost 65% of that was actual|compliment.
Is that a personal best?
What are you gonna teach|when you fail in life?
Advanced loser-being?
I will teach - ..
ze language of love.
|- Don't!
You have fish hands!
- Come!
Let me touch!
|- Stop it!
That's enough of that!
And you Are we having a chair shortage?
I didn't read anything about Oh.
I get it.
Displays of affection|are not acceptable in my school.
- This isn't an orgy.
It's a classroom.
|- Yeah!
Where they teach lunch.
Just give me a reason to kick you out,|Summers.
Just give me a reason.
Because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi ..
with a bug up his butt the size of an emu?
- Sums it up.
|- Don't you think?
You wanna come by|my house tonight and study too?
Maybe.
I do have to patrol.
Again?
Do you really expect|Angel to turn up tonight?
No, I don't expect him to.
|But that's usually when he does.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
|It's been two days since my last confession.
Father?
That's not very long.
Oh, Father, I'm so afraid.
The Lord is very forgiving.
- Tell me your sins.
|- I had I've been seeing again, Father.
Yesterday,|the men were going to work in the mine.
I had a terrible fright.
My stomach all tied up|and I saw this 'orrible crash.
My mummy said to keep my peace,|it didn't mean nothin'.
But this morning they had a cave-in.
- Two men died.
|- Go on.
Me mum says I'm cursed.
|My seeing things is an affront to the Lord.
That only He's supposed to|see anything before it 'appens.
But I don't mean to, Father, I swear!
I swear!
I try to be pure in His sight.
- I don't want to be an evil thing.
|- Hush, child.
The Lord has a plan for all creatures.
Even a devil child like you.
- A devil?
|- Yes, you're a spawn of Satan.
All the Hail Mays in the world won't help.
The Lord will use you|and smite you down.
He's like that.
- What can I do?
|- Fulfil his plan, child.
Be evil.
Just give in.
No!
I want to be good.
I want to be pure.
We all do, at first.
|The world doesn't work that way.
Father I beg you Please, please help me!
Very well.
|Ten Our Fathers and an act of contrition.
Does that sound good?
Yes!
Yes, Father, thank you.
The pleasure was mine.
- And, my child|- Yes?
God is watching you.
Nice walk, pet?
I met an old man.
Didn't like him.
He got stuck in my teeth.
But then the moon started whispering to me ..
all sorts of dreadful things.
- What did it say?
|- Oh, look who's awake!
What did the moon tell you?
Did you have a vision?
- Is something coming?
|- Oh, yeah!
Something terrible.
Pss, pss, pss.
- Where?
|- At the museum.
A tomb with a surprise inside.
- You can see all that in your head?
|- No, you ninny.
She read it in the paper.
Oh, my!
That's what's been whispering to me.
Sssh!
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry, though.
Soon it'll stop.
Soon it'll scream.
Waah!
This doesn't make any sense!
Sure, it does.
See - Oh, no, this doesn't make any sense.
|- It's senseless!
It is, but at least you know that,|so you're learning.
Yay me!
It doesn't matter.
I mean ..
when am I ever gonna need chemistry|or history or the English language?
- OK, I see your problem.
|- I'm a moron?
Will you stop that?
You're not stupid.
|You've just had a lot on your mind.
You can learn this easily, but if you're|gonna give up, then don't waste my time.
- Wow!
You are a good teacher.
|- OK, look at this.
A covalent bond,|which means these two atoms are linked by Oh!
Hold that thought.
- OK, I'm Learn Girl.
|- OK, so see here - Déjà vu.
|- Really?
Yeah.
I have this perfect memory of the pencil and Oh, hey You dropped this.
It's not mine.
|It might be something of Miss Calendar's.
- This feels kinda morbid.
|- I've seen most of her files already.
Does that make it less morbid|or you really morbid?
I had to.
To teach her class.
Relax, Will.
I was making with the funny.
- Does that say "restoration"?
|- It's one of her spells, I think.
She wasn't a practising witch, but Willow!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
It hurts, yes?
Good.
It will hurt more.
- Where am I?
|- You don't remember ..
everything you've done for 100 years.
In a moment, you will.
The face of everyone you killed,..
..
our daughter's face, ..
they will haunt you|and you will know what true suffering is.
Killed?
I don't No No No - What are you saying?
|- The curse.
This is it.
Looks like Miss Calendar was trying|to replicate the original curse.
To restore Angel's soul again.
- She said it couldn't be done.
|- Well, she tried anyway.
- It looks like it might've worked.
|- So he killed her ..
before she could tell anyone about it.
|What a prince, huh?
This is good, right?
|I mean, we can curse him again.
Erm Well, this erm ..
certainly points the way.
|But the ritual itself ..
requires a greater knowledge|of the black arts than I can claim.
Well, I've been going through her files|and researching the black arts for fun, ..
or educational fun,|and I may be able to work this.
Willow, channelling such potent magics|through yourself It could open a door|you may not be able to close.
I don't want you|putting yourself in any danger.
And I don't want danger.
Big "no" to danger,|but I may be the best person to do this.
Hi!
For those of you who've just tuned in,|everyone here is a crazy person.
So this spell might|restore Angel's humanity?
Well, here's an interesting angle.
- Who cares?
|- I care.
- Is that right?
|- Let's not lose our perspective here, Xander.
I'm Perspective Guy.
Angel's a killer.
Xander - It's not that simple.
|- What?
All is forgiven?
- I can't believe you!
|- Xander has a point.
For once I wish you'd support me!
|And I realise now that you were, ..
so I'm gonna get back to the point,|which is that Angel needs to die.
- Curing Angel was Jenny's last wish.
|- Yeah?
Well, Jenny's dead!
- Don't you ever|- Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Stop it!
Stop it!
What do you wanna do?
I don't know.
- What happened to Angel wasn't his fault.
|- But what happened to Miss Calendar is.
You can paint this any way you want.
But I think you wanna forget|about Miss Calendar's murder ..
so you can get your boyfriend back.
Hello?
I'll have one of these to go.
Dru?
Save me some.
I'll do a coupla sweeps and then I'll stop by.
Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a Willow!
Where did you learn that word?
My God!
|You kiss your mother with that mouth?
I don't know.
I don't know what I wanna do.
I'll I'll see you in a little while, OK?
Polite people call|before they jump out and attack you.
Just wanted to test your reflexes.
How about testing my face-punching?
|It's improved.
I was on my way to your house,|saw you walking, couldn't help myself.
Which begs the question, and don't think|I'm not glad to see you, but ..
why are you here?
Wait, no, let me guess.
Your watcher informed you that a very|dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
- That's about it.
|- Great.
Any idea what this dark power is?
It's a big rock.
I can't wait to tell my friends.
|They don't have a rock this big.
Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.
Let's have a lesson, then.
Acathla the demon came forth|to swallow the world.
He was killed by a knight|who pierced the demon's heart ..
before he could draw a breath|to perform the act.
Acathla turned to stone,|as demons sometimes do, ..
and was buried where neither man|nor demon would want to look.
Unless they're puttin' up low-rent housing.
Boys He fills my head!
I can't 'ear anything else.
Let me guess.
|Someone pulls out the sword, Someone worthy.
..
the demon wakes up and wackiness ensues.
- He will swallow the world.
|- Every creature on this planet will go to Hell.
My friends We're about to make history ..
end.
I've been on the phone to the museum.
The artefact is missing|and the curator has been murdered.
Vampires.
You're sure this was the tomb of Alfalfa?
Acathla.
And the information provided|by Kendra's watcher seems conclusive.
Somebody explain the whole|"he will suck the world into Hell" thing.
That's the part I'm not loving.
Well, the demon universe exists|in a dimension separate from our own.
With one breath,|Acathla will create a vortex, a kind of erm ..
whirlpool that will pull everything|on Earth into that dimension, ..
where any non-demon life|will suffer horrible and ..
eternal torment.
That would be the literal|kind of "sucked into Hell"?
Neat!
Willow, you should try the curse.
I tend to side with Xander on this one.
Angel should be eliminated.
Oh, I'll fight him.
I'll kill him if I have to.
But if I don't get there in time, or if I lose, - ..
then Willow might be our only hope.
|- I don't wanna be our only hope.
I crumble under pressure.
|Let's have another hope.
We have.
Blessed by the knight|who first slew the demon.
If all else fails, this might stop it, - ..
I tink.
|- Ooh, may I?
Thank you.
Well, let's hope all else doesn't fail.
How close are you|to figuring out the curse ritual?
I need about a day.
And ..
an orb of Thesulah, whatever that is.
A spirit vault for rituals of the undead.
|I've got one.
I've been using it as a paperweight.
This means I can't help you study|for tomorrow's final.
Ah, I'll wing it.
Of course, if we go to Hell by then,|I won't have to take 'em!
Or maybe I'll be taking them for ever.
Angel must also perform a ritual before he|can remove the sword and awaken Acathla.
With any luck, it should take some time.
Spike?
Spike, my sweet, the fun's about to begin.
I will drink.
The blood will wash in me, ..
over me, and I will be cleansed.
I will be worthy to free Acathla.
Bear witness ..
as I ascend, ..
as I become.
Everything that I am, ..
everything that I have done, ..
has led me here.
God, are you disgusting!
This is an unforgettable smell.
This is|the stench of death you're givin' off here.
And the look says "Crazy Homeless Guy".
|It's not good.
Get away from me!
What are you gonna do?
Bite me?
Horrors!
A vampire!
But you wouldn't bite me,|on account of your tortured soul.
It's so sad - a vampire with a soul.
|So poignant.
- Who are you?
|- Let's take a walk.
What are you eating?
|Like, a rat once a month?
Hey!
You're skin and bones!
Butcher shops are throwing away|more blood than you could stand.
- If you lived in the world a bit, you'd know.
|- I wanna know who you are.
- And I wanna know who you are.
|- You already do.
Not yet.
But I'm lookin' to find out.
Cos you could go either way here.
- I don't understand you|- Nobody does.
That's my curse.
Dog me.
Mustard.
My name's Whistler.
Thanks.
Anyway, lately it is.
You're not a vampire?
A demon.
Technically.
|I mean, I'm not a bad guy.
Not all demons are dedicated|to the destruction of all life.
What do you mean, I can go either way?
You can become an even more|useless rodent than you already are ..
or you can become someone.
A person.
- Someone to be counted.
|- I just want to be left alone.
You've been left alone for what,|90 years already.
And what a package you are.
The Stink Guy!
- What do you want from me?
|- I want you to see something.
We'd have to leave now.
You see, and then you tell me|what you wanna do.
Where is it?
So, I'm like "Dad, you want me to go to|the dance in an outfit I've already worn"?
Is Tyler taking you?
Where were you when I got over Tyler?
|He's of the past.
He'd have to crawl on his hands|and knees to go to the dance with me.
Which he's doing after practice, so I'll wait.
OK.
See ya later.
Bye.
- Call me.
Call me.
Call me.
|- I will.
Buffy Summers?
Yeah.
Hi!
What?
I need to speak with you.
You're not from Bullock's, are you?
|I meant to pay for that lipstick.
There isn't much time.
|You must come with me.
Your destiny awaits.
I don't have a destiny.
I'm destiny-free.
Yes, you have.
You are the Chosen One.
You alone can stop them.
- Who?
|- The vampires.
Huh?
Oh, not the heart!
You see?
You see your power?
- Why didn't you call?
|- I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was so late.
- Tyler and I were talking|- That boy is irresponsible.
No, Mom, it's not his fault.
You know we worry, that's all.
Dinner's in ten minutes.
Yeah.
- Did she say where she was?
|- With Tyler.
I don't want her seeing him any more.
- You're overreacting, dear.
|- Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!
I don't.
Just forget it.
Because you can't discipline her,|I have to be the ogre.
I am not having this conversation again,|all right?
She's gonna have it tough, that slayer.
She's just a kid.
A world full of big, bad things.
I wanna help her.
I want I wanna become someone.
God, jeez, look at ya!
She must be prettier than the last slayer.
This isn't gonna be easy.
The more you live in this world, the more|you see how apart from it you really are.
This is dangerous work.
Right now you|couldn't go three rounds with a fruit fly!
I wanna learn from you.
All right.
But I don't wanna dress like you.
Again, you're annoying me.
|You're lucky we need you on our side.
I have strayed.
I have been lost.
But Acathla redeems me.
With this act ..
we will be free.
# Someone wasn't worthy Dammit!
This is so disappointing.
There must be something I missed.
|The incantations, the blood!
I don't know!
- What are we going to do?
|- What we always do in a time of trouble.
Turn to an old friend.
We'll have our Armageddon, I swear!
Tonight, sundown, at the graveyard.
- Excuse me?
|- You will come to him.
You will come to him or more will die!
|Tonight!
His hour is at hand!
She said more would die.
I have to go!
- Then I should go with you.
|- No!
I need you here, just in case.
I can take care of myself.
And as long as Angel's fighting me, ..
then he can't do|this end-of-the-world ritual thingie.
What do you think?
- I just wanna crosscheck|- We don't have time.
If this is gonna work, it has to work now.
OK.
Then I need maybe half an hour|once we're all set up.
Which means you just have to hold Angel off.
|Don't let him close on you.
If the curse succeeds, you'll you'll know.
What don't you wait here to find out|if it worked?
See if he phones.
I can't risk him killing any more people.
I'd better go.
Be careful.
- I will.
|- Here!
In case the curse does not succeed,|this is my lucky stake.
I've killed many vampires with it.
I call it Mr Pointy.
- You named your stake?
|- Yes.
Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.
Thanks.
Watch your back.
Hello, lover.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
After your immolation-o-gram?
|Come on, I had to show.
Shouldn't you be pulling a sword out|of Al Franken or whatever his name is?
There's time enough.
|I wanted to say goodbye first.
You are the one thing in this dimension|I will miss.
This is a beautiful moment.
|Can we please fight?
I didn't come here to fight.
- No?
|- I was hoping we can get back together.
What do you think?
Do we have a shot?
All right!
We'll fight.
"Quod perditum est, invenietur, " "Not dead, nor not of the living".
"Spirits of the interregnum, I call".
Come on, Willow!
"Let him know the pain of humanity, gods".
"Reach your wizened hands to me.
|Give me the sword".
Get out!
Go!
Go!
Jeez, is it me or is your heart not in this?
Maybe I'll just go destroy the world.
Mr Pointy will have|something to say about that.
Come on, let's finish this.
You and me.
You never learn, do you?
|This wasn't about you.
This was never about you.
And you fall for it every single time!
Enough!
Look at me, dearie.
Be in my eyes.
Be in me.
Night-night.
Let's get what we came for, dears.
Bottom line is,|even if you see 'em comin.
..
you're not ready for the big moments, No one asks for their life to change, not really, But it does, So what are we?
Helpless?
Puppets?
No, The big moments are gonna come,|you can't help that, It's what you do afterwards that counts, That's when you find out who you are, Freeze!
You'll see what I mean,
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Freeze!
Put your hands up.
|Back away from the girl, slowly.
- Look, I didn't do anything.
|- Do it!
Now.
- This one's dead.
|- What about up there?
- Xander!
|- Get her out of here!
Wait.
Just see if he's OK!
Plea - You don't understand.
|- Keep your mouth shut, missy.
- But I didn't do anything.
|- Why is that hard to believe?
- In there!
You know this girl?
|- Buffy Summers.
- If there's trouble, she's behind it.
|- You stupid little troll.
You have no idea.
- Attitude problems.
Serious.
|- I just wanna know if my friends are OK.
All right, that's enough.
You have the right to remain silent.
|Anything you say can Stop!
Get down!
We have a fugitive on foot at the high school.
|Homicide suspect.
Female.
Blonde.
Approximately 16 years old.
|Suspect is very dangerous.
Xander!
Oh!
I was worried.
I didn't know|if you were OK.
The cops Yeah I heard 'em chase you out.
|I was just comin' out of it.
- Souvenir.
|- What about the others?
Are they OK?
OK.
That was about equal parts|protecting me and copping a feel, right?
What is it?
The doctor said it was head trauma.
She can wake up any time, but, um ..
the longer it lasts, the less likely it is.
I never should have let her|try to do that curse.
Angel must have known.
- Where are her parents?
|- With relatives in Phoenix.
I gave them a call.
|They're they're getting on a plane back.
Does Oz know?
Oh, man!
I didn't even think.
I'll I'll call him.
Hey.
- How is she?
The doctor told me that|- Yeah.
We're, uh, still waiting.
- Are you OK?
|- I ran.
I think I made it through three counties|before I realised nobody was chasing me.
- Not too brave.
|- It was the right thing to do.
- Did Giles keep up with you?
|- I didn't see Giles.
- You mean he's not in the hospital?
|- No.
Hi, Rupert.
I wasn't sure|you were gonna wake up.
- You had me worried.
|- What do you want?
I wanna torture you.
I used to love it and it's been a long time.
I mean, the last time I tortured somebody,|they didn't even have chain saws.
Oh, yeah.
Acathla.
He's an even harder guy|to wake up than you are.
I performed the ritual, said all|the right phrases Blood on my hand.
Got nothing - big doughnut hole|for my troubles.
I figure you know the ritual.
You're up|on these things.
You could probably ..
tell me what I'm doing wrong.
But honestly, I sort of hope you don't.
Cos I really wanna torture you.
No, it's impossible.
|There's been some terrible mistake.
You have no idea where your daughter is?
She was going to her friend Willow's house.
|Maybe she slept over.
- Is that Willow Rosenberg?
|- Yes.
- Second victim.
|- What?
Your daughter has a history of violence,|doesn't she, Ms Summers?
Well You call us, OK?
If she decides to stop by.
|Be best she just comes in.
Giles?
Giles?
I don't think he's here.
- Who are you?
|- Whistler.
- What are you doing here?
|- Waitin' for you.
- Why?
|- Cos I I need a date to the prom.
I have had a really bad day, OK?
If you have information, I am grateful.
|Crack jokes, I'll wear your ribcage as a hat.
Hello to the imagery!
Very nice.
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.
Nobody saw you coming.
|I figured this for Angel's big day.
But I thought he was here to stop Acathla.
|Not to bring him forth.
Then you two made with the smoochies,|and now he's a creep again.
And what are you gonna do?
- Or what are you prepared to do?
|- Whatever I have to.
Maybe I should ask what are|you prepared to give up?
You have nothing useful to tell me.
What are you?
A demon sent to|even the score between good and evil?
Wow!
Good guess.
Why not get off your immortal ass and fight|evil?
I'm sick and tired of doing it myself.
In the end you're always by yourself.
|You're all you've got.
That's the point.
- Spare me.
|- The sword isn't enough.
You gotta be ready.
|You gotta know how to use it!
Hold it right there!
|Put your hands on your head.
Do it!
Hello, cutie.
Ugh!
Will you hold on a second?
!
Hey!
White flag here.
I quit.
Let me clear this up.
|We're mortal enemies - no time-outs.
You wanna go a round, I'll have|a gay old time.
If you want to stop Angel, - ..
we'll have to play this a bit differently.
|- What do you mean?
I'm talking about your ex, pet.
I'm talking|about putting him in the bloody ground.
This has gotta be the lamest trick|you guys have ever thought up!
He's got your watcher.
- Right now, he's probably torturing him.
|- What do you want?
I told you.
I want to stop Angel.
- I want to save the world.
|- You do remember that you're a vampire?
We like to talk big, vampires do.
"I'm going to destroy the world".
It's just tough-guy talk.
Struttin' around|with your friends over a pint of blood.
The truth is, I like this world.
You've got dog racing, Manchester United, ..
and you've got people.
Billions of people walking around like|Happy Meals with legs.
It's all right here.
But then, someone comes|along with the vision.
With a real passion for destruction.
Angel could pull it off.
Goodbye Piccadilly, farewell Leicester|bloody Square.
You know what I'm saying?
OK, fine.
You're not down with Angel.
Why would you ever come to me?
I want Dru back.
I want it like it was before he came back.
- The way she acts around him.
|- You're pathetic.
- I lost a friend tonight.
I may lose more.
|- I wasn't in on that raiding party.
Earth may be sucked into Hell, and you want|help cos your girlfriend's a big ho?
- Let me take this opportunity to not care.
|- I can't fight them both alone.
Nor can you.
- I hate you.
|- And I'm all you've got.
All right.
Talk.
- I just need to kill this guy.
|- Ahem!
- Oh, right.
|- Let's get inside.
- Do you want some coffee?
|- I don't wanna leave.
She might, uh - I'll get it.
|- Thanks.
Come on, Will.
Look, you don't have a choice here.
You gotta wake up.
I need you, Will.
I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know?
And who am I gonna call every night ..
and talk about everything we did all day?
You're my best friend.
You've always I love you.
Willow?
Oz?
Oz?
I'm here.
She's just starting to wake up.
- Hey, baby.
|- Hi.
I'm gonna go get a doctor.
How're you feelin'?
My head feels big.
Is it big?
No, it's head-sized.
Is everybody else OK?
Rupert, buddy, ..
I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.
How you holdin' up?
Never better!
Glad to hear it.
Now, ..
tell me when it hurts.
Buffy?
Where have you been?
Are you OK?
The|police were here.
I've been looking for you.
- Let's go inside.
I can explain.
|- Who is this man?
Who are you?
- Are you OK?
|- Mom.
I'm OK.
Terrible things have happened.
|What were you doing?
- Your mom doesn't know?
|- Know what?
That I'm, uh in a band.
A rock band, with Spike here.
- Right.
She plays the triangle.
|- Drums.
Drums, yeah.
She's hell on the old skins.
- Mm.
And, uh, what do you do?
|- Well, I sing.
You know what?
Why don't we go inside,|and we can talk about this?
I'm not sure how I feel about this.
- One of Angel's boys.
|- Yeah, probably watching me.
Or you.
- He won't get a chance to tattle on us now.
|- Buffy, ..
what is going on?
Mom, ..
I'm a vampire slayer.
I'm OK, Buffy.
Really.
I mean, I don't feel good, but ..
I'm awake and I know my name and|who's president and how many fingers.
So, they don't think my brain|got mushed at all.
- Thank God.
I'm so sorry I can't be there.
|- I know, I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
Don't be.
It just wasn't meant to be.
I know I'm never gonna get him back|the way he was.
It just makes it easier.
I guess.
Any luck finding Giles?
Yep.
I got a lucky break.
- What?
|- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Xander?
Angel and the others|are holed up outside town.
Remember that funky-looking mansion?
On Crawford Street, sure.
|That makes sense.
What's the drill?
- I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.
|- Need backup?
No.
You stay there.
I'm covered.
Do you, um - Do you think Giles is still alive?
|- I think he is.
I just wish he was here to tell me what to do.
Have we met?
Er You hit me with an axe one time.
Remember, er, "Get the hell away|from my daughter"?
So, do you live here in town?
- Is Willow all right?
|- Yeah, she's fine.
- All right, talk.
What's the deal?
|- Simple.
You let me and Dru skip town,|I help you kill Angel.
- Angel, your boyfriend?
|- Forget Drusilla.
She doesn't walk.
- There's no deal without Dru.
|- She killed Kendra.
Dru bagged a slayer?
!
She didn't tell me!
Hey, good for her.
- Though not from your perspective.
|- I can't believe I invited you into my house.
- So, you didn't kill that girl?
|- Of course not.
- Did she explode like that man out there?
|- She was a slayer, Mom.
Like what you are?
Look this deal works only one way.
|Full stop.
Me and Dru, for Angel.
- Are you sure you're a vampire slayer?
|- I'll take her out of the county.
You'll never hear from us again,|I bloody well hope.
Fine.
Get back to the mansion,|make sure Giles is all right.
- I mean, have you tried not being a slayer?
|- Mom!
Be ready to back me up|when I make my move.
If Giles dies, ..
she dies.
It's because you didn't have|a strong father figure.
It's just fate, Mom.
I'm the Slayer.
Accept it.
- We should call the police.
|- No!
- Now we know you're innocent|- You thought I was guilty?
- Jeez, feelin' the love in this room|- No, I didn't think that.
It's just - ..
now we have proof.
|- We have my word, Mom, not proof.
- Look, I am sure that they will understand.
|- Get them involved, you'll get them killed.
- You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
|- I'm a slayer, not a postal worker.
Cops can't fight demons.
I have to do it.
- Do what?
Buffy, what is happening?
|- Just have another drink.
Don't you talk to me that way!
You don't dump this on me|and pretend it's nothing!
- I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.
|- No, I am tired of "I don't have time" or ..
"You wouldn't understand".
I am your|mother.
You make time to explain yourself.
- I told you.
I'm a vampire slayer.
|- Well, I just don't accept that!
Open your eyes, Mom.
What do you think|has been going on for the past two years?
The fights, the weird occurrences How many times have you|washed blood out of my clothing?
- Well, it stops now!
|- No, it doesn't stop!
It never stops!
Do do you think I chose to be like this?
Do you have any idea how lonely it is?
|How dangerous?
I would love to be upstairs watching TV,|or gossipping about boys, or ..
God, even studying!
|But I have to save the world.
Again!
- No, this is insane.
Buffy, you need help.
|- I'm not crazy!
- What I need is for you to chill.
I have to go.
|- No.
I am not letting you out of this house.
- You can't stop me.
|- Oh yes, I You walk out of this house,|don't even think about coming back!
Buffy's going for the big showdown.
I wish|we could help.
You know, without dying.
- I don't see how.
|- I wanna try again.
- Try what?
|- The curse.
We never got to finish it.
- Maybe we can restore Angel's soul.
|- I don't like it.
It's messing with powerful magic.
|You're weak.
- I'm OK.
|- You don't look OK.
Does she?
You should listen to him.
|The hair, it's so flat.
And the lips - Could we stay on topic here, honey?
|- What?
- It's not a good idea.
|- There's no use arguing with me.
Do you see my resolve face?
You've|seen it before - you know what it means.
This can help Buffy.
|If we turn Angel back soon enough, ..
we can stop him|from ever awakening Acathla.
OK.
I missed out on some stuff,|didn't I?
Because ..
this is all making|the kind of sense that's not.
Go with Cordy to the library|and get my things.
She'll fill you in.
Sure.
I'll drive.
Xander, go to Buffy.
Tell her|what we're doing.
Maybe she can stall.
- But I|- Resolve face.
Be careful.
You know, I can stop the pain.
You've been very brave but it's over.
You've given enough.
Now let me make it stop.
Please.
Just tell me what I need to know.
In order to ..
to be worthy, ..
you must perform the ritual ..
in a tutu.
Pillock!
- Someone get the chain saw.
|- Now, now, don't let's lose our temper.
Keep out of it, Sit 'n' Spin.
Look, you cut him up,|you'll never get your answers.
- Since when did you become level-headed?
|- About the time you became pig-headed.
Hurt him, you'll never destroy the world.
I don't fancy spending the next month|getting librarian out of the carpet.
- There are other ways.
|- Enlighten me.
Drusilla?
Sweetheart?
Do you want to play a game?
You do know this is a crime scene,|don't you?
But then, you're a criminal,|so that pretty much works out.
You know I didn't do it.
|The police will figure it out.
In case you haven't noticed,|the police of Sunnydale are deeply stupid.
It doesn't matter anyway.
|Whatever they find, ..
you've proved|too much of a liability for this school.
These are the moments you savour.
You wish time would stop, so that|you could live them over and over again.
You're expelled.
You never got a single date|in high school, did you?
Your point being?
It's Snyder.
Tell the mayor I have good news.
Is that better?
Poor thing.
Let's see what's inside.
Of course.
Look at me.
Be in me.
Mmm See with your heart.
Jenny!
I thought I'd lost you.
I'll never leave you.
- We have to get out of here.
|- No, no, no, no, no.
Slowly.
It can't be you.
Did you tell Angel?
About the ritual?
No.
We have to get him away from Acathla.
- Why?
Is he close to figuring it out?
|- Later.
Tell me what to do.
It's all right.
We'll be together.
Finally.
We'll have everything we never got to have.
Never got to feel.
Just tell me what to do.
We have to get Angel away from Acathla.
Angel himself?
- He's the key?
|- His his blood.
He he mustn't Blood.
Of course.
The blood|on my hands must be my own.
I am the key that will open up the door.
|My blood.
My life.
- OK, kill him.
|- But what if he's lying?
Yeah.
Good point.
All right, don't kill him.
You know, I kinda like having you|watch my back.
It's kinda like old times.
Er, Drusilla?
- Honey?
|- We are finished here, ducks.
Sorry.
I was in the moment.
Whistler.
What did you mean,|"The sword isn't enough"?
Raidin' an Englishman's fridge|is like dating a nun.
- You're never gonna get the good stuff.
|- Tell me how to use it.
Angel's the key.
His blood will open the door to Hell.
Acathla opens his big mouth,|creates a vortex.
Then only Angel's blood will close it.
|One blow will send 'em both back to Hell.
But I strongly suggest that|you get there before that happens.
- The faster you kill Angel, the easier for you.
|- Don't worry about me.
- It's all on the line here, kid.
|- I can deal.
I got nothin' left to lose.
Wrong, kid.
You got one more thing.
- Xander?
|- The cavalry's here.
The cavalry's a frightened guy|with a rock, but it's here.
- That's better.
|- You're not here to fight.
Get Giles out and run like hell.
Understood?
|I can't protect you.
I'm gonna be killing.
- You know, that's a new look for you.
|- It's a present for Angel.
Willow, uh she told me to tell you Tell me what?
Kick his ass.
Acathla, mundatus sum, Pro te necavi, Sanguinem meum pro te effundam.
..
quo me dignum ..
esse demonstram, - Are we ready?
|- Stinky herbs are go!
Did I mention I didn't take Latin?
You don't have to understand it.
|You just say it.
- I hope.
|- Right.
Now, Acathla, ..
you will be free.
And so will we all.
- Hello, lover.
|- I don't have time for you, - You don't have a lot of time left.
|- Coming on kinda strong, aren't ya?
You're playing some deep odds.
|Do you think you can take us all on?
No.
I don't.
Painful, isn't it?
I don't wanna hurt you, baby.
That doesn't mean I won't.
Quod perditum est ..
invenietur, Not dead, nor not of the living.
Spirits of the interregnum, I call.
Giles!
Giles?
!
Xander?
- Can you walk?
|- You're not real.
- Sure I'm real.
|- It's a trick.
They get inside my head,|make me see things I want.
Then why would they make you see me?
Oh, right.
Let's go.
Come on Come on.
Ooh!
Here he comes.
Gods, bind him, cast his heart ..
from the evil realm.
- You almost made it, Buff.
|- It's not over yet.
My boy, Acathla here, is about to wake up.
|You're going to Hell.
Save me a seat.
In return, ..
I call on - Willow?
|- Are you OK?
Is this a good thing?
Hey speak English!
Sorry, baby.
I wish there was another way.
God, he's gonna kill her.
That's everything, huh?
No weapons, ..
no friends no hope.
Take all that away and what's left?
Me.
Buffy?
What's going on?
Where are we?
I I don't remember.
Angel?
You're hurt.
Oh, Buffy!
God I feel like I haven't seen you in months.
Oh, God, everything's so muddled, I Oh, Buffy.
- What's happenin'?
Don't worry about it.
- I love you.
|- I love you.
Close your eyes.
Buffy?
# The winter here's cold # And bitter # It's chilled us to the bone # We haven't seen the sun for weeks # Too long, too far from home # I feel just like I'm sinking - Buffy?
|- # And I claw for solid ground # I'm pulled down by the undertow # I never thought I could feel so low # Oh darkness, I feel like letting go # Hall of the strength and all of the courage # Come and lift me from this place Willow, are you sure|you should be out of bed?
- Look who's talking.
|- Yes.
- Any word?
|- You guys haven't seen her, either?
- No.
|- But the world didn't end, cos check it out.
Well, we, er we went back|to the mansion.
It it was empty.
Erm and Acathla was was dormant.
I think the spell worked.
|I felt something go through me.
Plus, the orb did that cool glow thing.
Maybe it wasn't in time.
Maybe|she had to kill him before the cure worked.
Then she'd wanna be alone.
Or maybe Angel was saved|and they want to be alone together.
- Perhaps.
|- Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later.
- We still have school.
|- Yeah.
She'll be here in a while.
# Everything we say and do # Hurts us all the more # It's just that we stayed # Too long # In the same old sickly skin # I'm pulled down by the undertow # I never thought I could feel so low # Oh darkness, I feel like letting go # Hall of the strength and all of the courage # Come and lift me from this place # I know I could love you|much better than this # Full of grace # I know I could love you|much better than this # It's better this way
