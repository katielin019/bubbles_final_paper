{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": You are the Chosen One.
You alone can stop them.
- Who?
- The vampires.
Ooh!
You see your power?
- Why can't you people just leave me alone?
- To each generation a slayer is born.
You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes.
We were together from the beginning.
We've gone on patrols, and done demon research.
We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.
Anya, you wanna marry me?
- Angel - I love you.
So don't go.
Home sweet home.
That chip is deeply embedded in your cerebral cortex.
Argh!
- I can't bite anything.
I can't even hit people.
- What?
Spike had a trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies.
I know you'll never love me.
I know that I'm a monster.
But you treat me like a man.
"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the Key to her in the form of a sister".
You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
The little girl.
The Key.
Destroy it and the will of the Beast will be broken.
Spike!
No!
- I have to jump.
- It'll kill you.
Look at what's happening.
- Buffy no!
- Dawnie, I have to.
You have to take care of each other.
You have to be strong.
Be brave.
Live.
For me.
Come on!
We're never gonna get anything killed with you lot holdin' me back.
I thought the big ones were supposed to tire more easily.
- No, that's over-the-hill shopkeepers.
- I'm fine.
I just need to die for a minute.
That powder you blew at him made him rabbit off.
It's sorbus root.
It was supposed to confuse him, but it just kinda made him peppy.
It's not supposed to mix with anything.
You think he's on prescription medication?
- Yeah.
That must be it.
- I hope he doesn't operate heavy machinery.
- Yeah.
We could all be in real - Guys, heads up.
The vampire's circling back towards you.
Six o'clock.
Try to drive him towards the Van Elton crypt.
- Van Elton.
- Is that the one with the cute little gargoyle?
Left!
Make him go left!
Big, fast, and dumb.
Just the way I like'em.
- The other units are engaged.
- Stop!
Great googly-moogly, Willow.
Quit doing that.
- I said I'd get a lay of the land.
- But not the lay of my brain.
It's intrusive.
You could knock first or something.
- Xander - I know, I don't have to talk to answer you.
But I saw The Fury.
That way lies spooky carnival death.
Xander!
Vampire!
Other side of that tomb.
Get the jump on him.
Go the other way.
Why didn't you say so?
Tara, down!
Spike!
Spike!
- What are you doing?
Help him!
- I did.
You might have let me in on your plan while he throttled me.
Poor Watcher.
Did your life pass before your eyes?
"Cup of tea, cup of tea, almost got shagged, cup of tea"?
Guys, help Xander and Anya over by the Anderson tomb.
Xander!
I got it!
That'll put marzipan in your pie plate, bingo!
What's with the Dadaism, Red?
She says that pie thing every time she stakes a vamp.
I don't know, I was trying to program in some new puns and I ended up with word salad.
- I think it's funny.
- It's a glitch.
I'll fix it.
We just can't have her messing up in front of the wrong person, or the wrong thing.
We need the world and the underworld to believe that Buffy is alive and well.
And I will therefore fix it.
I got her head back on, didn't l?
- And I got her off knock-knock jokes.
- Oh, who's there?
- You know, if we want her to be exactly - She'll never be exactly.
- I know.
- The only really real Buffy is really Buffy.
And she's gone.
We-want-her-to-be-exactly- she'll-never-be-exactly-l-know- the-only-really-real-Buffy-is really-Buffy-and-she's-gone who?
Where's my clog?
I think there's a clog-eating monster under the bed.
It's really those lesser-known monsters that make living in Sunnydale so hard.
I believe that that is a Dawn monster.
She borrowed them yesterday.
Dawnie?
Hey, you up?
You doin' OK?
Besides terror about today and a general feeling of impending doom, swell.
Breakfast will make all things better.
Ooh, pancakes could go in bellies.
Dawnie?
Hey, you.
Today's the big day, huh?
Kinda day that makes you wanna return clogs, don't you think?
I don't have your clogs.
- Morning.
- Morning!
We could go over your programming again.
Again?
You've done enough, sweetie.
She's either ready to face this thing or she's not.
Oh, um, here's some juice, and pancakes are on the way.
- Funny shapes or rounds?
- Rounds are fine.
- What's up with the megawiches?
- I don't know if we're mega.
Willow, maybe No, I mean who's gonna eat all that?
Oh!
Oops.
She wanted to help, and I got her started, but then I forgot to unstart.
House of chicks, relax.
I am a man, and I have a tool.
Tools.
Lots of plural tools.
In my, uh toolbox.
Ah!
Sandwiches.
Excellent.
Men like sandwiches.
Help yourself.
Really.
So what brings you so early, your machoness?
Brought that soldering wire for Buffybot's tune-up.
- You got funny shapes anyway.
Sorry.
- I'll get it!
- No!
It could be my dad.
He said he'd call today.
I'll just say hello.
He's my biological ancestor.
Hello?
Hey, Anya.
Really?
That's fantastic!
Anya found that thing, for tonight.
Yeah?
Great.
And you're her sweet cookie-face.
I go by many names.
- What's tonight?
- Just a Scooby meeting.
Spike'll be with you.
You know, Buffybot, maybe you should let the machine - the other machine - answer the phone from now on.
- Is my phone manner not correct?
- It's perfect.
It's just Mr Summers might talk to you and know something's wrong.
If he thought the real Buffy was gone, he could take Dawn away.
And I wanna stay here, with you and Willow and Tara.
Understand?
I do.
I want you to stay here as well.
You're my sister.
So excellent.
We're agreed.
Sit your robo-self down so we can get to work.
Need to fix up those fighting skills pronto.
We have bigger worries than fighting skills today.
- Way bigger.
- I guess.
- Depends on how highly you prize punning.
- I'm serious, Xander.
Buffybot is about to face her most dangerous challenge ever.
OK.
So, we'll make a quick lap so people can see you're here.
And then we'll just What is this?
Oh.
Um, this is our city of the future.
I made the hover cars.
They're orange-juice cans.
See?
They're very nice.
But I still don't understand.
We're reading Walden.
This is, uh, a kids' version of a utopian society.
There are no schools, but a huge number of pizza parlours.
I don't think I know of a breed of humans this small.
Who's going to live here?
Oh God, she's always like this.
Come on, wacky Buffy.
See you, Mr Davis.
As you see, we provide the best in progressive learning.
But we can't teach your children unless you do.
As parents, we have a responsibility to create the right attitude.
To teach your child what school can mean.
Ms Summers?
School is where you learn.
Exactly.
Parents let kids focus on school as a social experience rather than a learning experience.
We want you to get your kids just as excited about education as about the lunch hour.
I helped make lunch today.
- Oh.
- Yes.
Before school.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I don't eat, but Dawn takes one every day.
Tell me about it.
My kid's brown-bagging it even though I paid for the lunch programme.
It's true.
Something has to be done about the quality of the food.
Anya, this register report for January looks a bit off.
Pull the files again.
Are you mad at me?
- Mad?
No, l - Well, then why are you torturing me?
I punished people like this when I was a demon.
I made them check spreadsheets for eternity.
Sorry if you resent my thoroughness, but l won't be comfortable leaving until I know You're taking the Ramadan effigy?
It's not inventory, it's my personal collection.
Uh-huh.
Aren't you Mr Dicey Semantics?
So, what, you think you can just take anything you want?
- Give it!
- No, you give it!
Ow!
Ow!
OK, when I'm marvelling at the immaturity be scared.
Anya, Giles is gonna leave the store to you when he goes.
What more do you want?
I am not leaving the store to anyone.
I'm going to England.
I'm not dead, I'm still a partner.
- Silent overseas partner.
- Who you should be very nice to.
Unless you want to end up working at Video Hut.
What are you doin'?
What kind of gratitude is that?
I know.
I know.
It's just he keeps saying he's going, and then he doesn't.
And I keep almost being in charge, but then I'm not.
And maybe he shouldn't be going at all, but we can't talk about that.
And it all just leaves me with this stress and bossiness stored up, and it just leaks out.
Just give it time, An.
This is hard for all of us.
- Just be patient.
- I was being patient, but it took too long.
I mean, I miss Buffy.
I do.
But life shouldn't just stop because she's gone.
I'm sick of waiting to take over here, and I'm sick of waiting to tell everyone about us.
We talked about this.
We can't announce our engagement while things are so up in the air.
Why not?
It's happy news.
Happy news in hard times is a good thing.
It is, but if things go as planned, everything can be different.
- Let's just hold on.
- You've been saying that all summer.
Please, Anya.
We'll know more after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight.
Whatever.
Just remember this whole marriage thing was your stupid idea.
I didn't ask to be all crazy.
So my homeroom teacher, Ms Lefcourt, was, like, "Your sister is an example to us all".
She wanted to make it National Buffy Day.
- Makes sense.
- It does?
She responded to Buffybot because a robot is predictable.
It's boring.
Perfect teacher's pet.
That's all schools are.
Just factories, spewing out mindless little automatons who go on to be very valuable and productive members of society, and you should go.
Because Buffy would want you to.
Check.
One mindless automaton coming up.
So, uh, what do you fancy, Bit?
A game of rummy?
Well, Willow and Tara said they'd be back early.
You don't really have to hang.
I mean, if you're bored.
- I'm not, and yeah, I do.
- But I'm fine alone.
It's not like anyone's coming after me.
I'm not the Key.
Or, if I am, I don't open anything any more.
It's over.
Remember?
I'm not leaving you here by yourself, so forget it.
Well, I'm just saying No.
I'm not leaving you to get hurt.
Not again.
Now deal.
Don't be scared.
I'm going to kill him.
- Slayer!
- You can run away now.
Not you!
You're you're a machine!
Thank you.
Stop!
Vampires beware.
- The urn of Osiris.
- You really found it.
Yeah.
It wasn't easy.
I went through every supplier the Magic Box has.
You used a Magic Box supplier?
What if Giles finds out?
He's too busy not leaving to pay attention to me.
Besides, I ended up getting it on eBay.
You found the last urn of Osiris on eBay?
Yeah, from this desert gnome in Cairo.
He drove a hard bargain, but I got him to throw in a limited edition Backstreet Boys lunchbox for ..
a friend.
So, you got your sombre on, Will.
Is the urn not up to spec?
It's the one.
- Which means it's time.
- It's time?
Like, time time?
With the timeliness?
- Are you sure?
- I am.
Mercury's in retrograde, and we have Do we have everything?
- Just about.
- But why the sudden rushy-rush?
Did the bot blow our cover at school?
No, she did great.
She impressed the teachers.
- And they still thought it was Buffy?
- Tomorrow night, we'll meet back here.
Whoa!
Let's apply the brakes and check the rear and side-view mirrors here.
This is deep stuff, Willow.
We're talking about raising the dead.
It's time we stopped talking.
Tomorrow night, we're bringing Buffy back.
Tomorrow?
I don't know.
Discovery Channel has monkeys.
And our tape machine's wonky.
Guys, I need you on board here.
It's just It feels wrong.
It is wrong.
It's against all the laws of nature, and practically impossible to do, but it's what we agreed to.
If you guys are changing your minds Nobody's changing their minds.
Period.
Excuse me?
Who made you the boss of the group?
- You did.
- You said Willow should be boss.
You said "Let's vote" and it was unanimous.
You made her a little plaque that said "Boss of Us", you put sparkles on it Valid points, all.
But we I mean - We were just talking then.
- Xander, I can do this, I promise.
But not without you.
Should we maybe tell Giles?
You know, now that we're really ready?
It's not like he's going anywhere.
Ever.
No.
No one else can know.
Not Giles, not Spike, not Dawn.
They might not understand.
- What if something does go wrong?
- I'm telling you it won't.
Scenario We raise Buffy from the grave, she tries to eat our brains.
Do we - A - congratulate ourselves on a job well done - Xander, this isn't zombies.
- Zombies don't eat brains unless instructed to by their zombie masters.
A lot of people get that wrong.
This isn't like Dawn bringing Mrs Summers back, or anything we've dealt with before.
Buffy didn't die a natural death.
She was killed by mystical energy.
Which means we do have a shot.
It means more than that.
It means we don't know where she really is.
We saw her body, Will.
We buried it.
Her body, yeah.
But her soul, her essence That could be somewhere else.
She could be trapped in a hell dimension like Angel was, suffering eternal torment just because she saved us, and I'm not gonna let her I'm not gonna leave her there.
It's Buffy.
What time do we meet?
- Willow!
- What happened?
Where's Dawn?
Upstairs in bed.
But the bot seems to have got into a scrape while she was on patrol.
I think my feet are broken.
Looks like a short in the navigational system.
Can you get a flashlight?
It's in the kitchen.
She wanted to look for you but I figured there are enough things that go bump in the night.
Good thinking.
But my homing device locates you when I'm injured.
I am programmed to go to you.
Right.
I know.
Still, I think just this once it was a good idea to stay put.
Spike was right.
Sorry I questioned you, Spike.
You know I admire your brain almost as much as your washboard abs.
- I told you to make her stop doing that.
- I did.
I mean, I thought I got all that stuff out of the program.
Well, you've got her opened up.
Fix it.
Sure.
I mean, I have a lot of work here, but I'll see what I can do.
Can you shine the flashlight right here?
Spike?
Did I say something wrong?
No.
It's not your fault.
I think Spike stopped liking me.
That's not true.
He thinks you're swell.
Then how come he never looks at me any more?
Even when he's talking to me.
He just gets cranky, the way vampires do.
Now, just relax.
I am gonna make you good as new.
I promise.
That was splendid.
Now, try it again.
Only this time, remember your breathing.
Yeah, that's good, but, er Think of the breath as chi.
Air as a life source.
I don't require oxygen to live.
- Of course, strictly speaking, but - Um Maybe you should stick to the standard drill.
You don't want her to blow another gasket.
I'm testing her responses after her injury.
I see no harm in imparting a little Eastern philosophy.
Well, I just think that the concept of chi might be a little hard for her to grasp.
You know, she's not the descendant of a long line of mystical warriors.
- She's the descendant of a toaster oven.
- Yes, well, I appreciate your input, Anya.
But I think Buffybot has responded nicely to our sessions.
Well, you're the boss.
Still.
Would you like to test me again?
No, perhaps we should call it a day.
Your responses are fine.
Perhaps Anya's right.
Perhaps I am trying to teach you as if you were a Human?
- Yes.
- I like your teachings.
Every slayer needs her watcher.
I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
I just can't help but wonder if she would have been better off without me.
Buffy.
I don't think that's true.
You were very helpful to her.
Right.
Yes, I was a perfect watcher.
I did what any good watcher would do.
- Got my slayer killed in the line of duty.
- That wasn't your fault.
Of course not.
That's how all slayer-watcher relationships end, isn't it?
She's gone.
I did my job.
Then why are you still here?
So I got her cornered in this alley, see?
You got the Slayer cornered?
Yeah.
I figured it's my duty.
She's a menace to our society.
So we fight, and I'm, like, boo-boo-boo!
And I got her on the ropes - You're lyin' to me.
- I swear on all that's unholy!
You haven't even heard the best part.
I cut her, right?
And she's I don't know, some kinda machine.
She's not human!
You're high.
I'm tellin' ya, it wasn't even the Slayer, man.
It was like a trick.
A robot.
- What's with the blood rat?
- Talk.
OK.
So, I was over in Sunnydale, minding my own beeswax, when I see the Slayer - The part about the robot.
- We fought, right?
And I was like all over her, boo-boo-boo He says the Slayer's been replaced by some kind of machine.
A robot, yeah!
And I kicked her synthetic ass.
You should've seen the sparks You tellin' me there's no slayer in Sunnydale?
That's what I'm sayin'.
They got some kinda decoy standin' in for her.
- Town is wide open.
- Nowhere like the Hellmouth for a party.
There's all kinds of bad in that place.
I guess with your muscle, you could own it in no time.
Look, I know you guys don't usually let vampires join the gang, and I got the whole "sunlight issue".
But I was thinkin', you know, as thanks for the 411, you could let me I'll think it over.
Let's ride!
Adonai, Helomi, Pine.
Adonai, Helomi, Pine.
The gods do command thee from thy majesty.
O Mappa Laman, Adonai, Helomi.
Come forward, blessed one.
Know your calling.
Come forward, blessed one.
Accept our humble gratitude for your offering.
In death, you give life.
May you find wings to the kingdom.
Hey.
You're late.
Oh.
I, uh, had to get that thing.
Giles isn't around, you can dump the cryptic.
The last spell ingredient.
OK.
Right.
What is vino de madre anyway?
"Wine of the mother".
Kind of black-market stuff.
You didn't tell me that.
You shouldn't have gone alone, it could have been dangerous.
Sorry.
I didn't - I was careful.
- Well, it must be something pretty intense.
The black market's all baby teeth and spooky fluids.
All I know is we have to have it to finish the spell, so it's good stuff in my book.
How come you guys are here anyway?
I thought we weren't gonna meet till later.
We weren't.
It just felt weird hangin' out on our own.
It's better if we stay together.
Aw, you got butterflies, baby?
More like bats.
You wanna look at the money?
I find it always calms me.
That's OK, thanks.
Baby, tell those bats that everything is gonna be all right.
I promise.
- We couldn't be more prepared.
- I know, I just wish it was time.
I I can't stand worrying about it any more.
Well, it's your lucky day, then.
I have something that will distract you.
What?
"I've gone.
Not one for long goodbyes".
"l thought it best to slip out quietly".
"Love to you all.
Giles".
You really think we'd let you get away with that?
I was trying to avoid a scene, really.
Like we'd make a scene.
Not you.
Me.
We brought you some lovely parting gifts.
It's American.
Get it?
Apple pie?
To remind you of all the good food you won't be eating.
And a monster.
Sort of a Sunnydale souvenir, we thought.
Thank you.
And I wanted to buy you a can of Olde English "800".
Cos, you know, England, and you, and because at the time it sounded really funny.
But the guy who lives in the box in front of the store, he, uh, he wouldn't buy it for us.
We got your presents at the gas station.
We were kind of in a hurry.
We made this in the car.
It's why the letters are all shaky.
This is, er impossible, really.
We just wanted you to know that we'll miss you.
We'll be OK.
We'll miss you, but we'll be OK.
I'll take really good care of your money.
Yes, I have no doubt.
Flight 3982, leaving for Los Angeles and continuing to London.
- Rows 20 through 30 - That's me.
Now?
We just made it.
Just.
Yes.
Well, look, if we're going to do this, let's do it properly.
I'm just a phone call away.
If you need anything You must promise me.
I do.
I promise.
Willow, I don't know where to start.
Well, maybe you shouldn't.
I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy.
Right, right.
Well, you should get goin'.
Don't you have a life or somethin'?
I suppose that's the question, really.
Just, er be careful.
Please.
There he goes.
It's a good thing.
My face was gettin' sore from all that faux-smiling.
It was right, though, wasn't it?
Giving him the no-tears sendoff?
I mean, we don't want him goin' off all worried about us.
He'd still be all worried, just eight hours ahead.
What's he gonna do over there by himself?
He never talks about people from England.
What if he's lonely?
He won't be lonely.
He used to live there before, remember?
And I'm sure we'll talk to him all the time, right?
It's not like he's We'll call him tomorrow, how about that?
See how his flight was?
Yeah?
Can you believe the timing?
He's leaving right when we're ready to do the thing.
I know.
I had hoped we'd figure it out before he he left.
Maybe we should have told him.
I mean, what if it works?
He'll come back.
- lt'll be dark soon.
- Yeah.
We should get Dawn home.
I wanna go over everything again.
Nothing can go wrong tonight.
Everybody got their candles?
I'm trying.
My lighter won't stay lit.
- Well, hurry, it has to - What time is it?
A minute till midnight.
Come on, Anya.
Do you have it?
I got it, I got it.
I got it.
OK.
Start the circle.
Now.
Osiris, keeper of the gate, master of all fate, hear us.
Before time, and after.
Before knowing and nothing.
Accept our offering.
Know our prayer.
- Willow!
- No!
She told me she'd be tested.
This is what's supposed to happen.
Osiris here lies the warrior of the people.
Let her cross over.
Willow!
- She needs help!
- Xander, she's strong!
She said not to stop, no matter what.
If we break the cycle now, it's over.
Oh, God, what is that noise?
Osiris, let her cross over!
- Willow!
- Willow?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's a test.
It's a test.
Willow - What's going on?
- Stay away from the window.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Just do as I say.
I'm gonna check the rest of the house.
Don't move!
That doesn't belong to you.
Put it back.
Slayer, I've been hearin' interesting things about you.
Yes.
I am interesting.
- These your friends?
- They're my boys, yeah.
Good.
Now tell them to get back on their loud bicycles and go back where they came from.
Or what?
You'll electrocute us?
Hold her.
You're nothing but a toy.
A pretty toy.
Wanna play?
I would, but you've injured me.
I have to return to Willow.
Get her!
Stop her!
Ride!
Osiris, release her!
Willow!
I need service!
Willow!
No!
Willow!
Look what I found!
Take off!
Go!
Go!
Anya!
Dissolvo!
Willow.
Willow, are you OK?
Did it work?
I'm sorry.
Oh, um dangerously close um systems failure.
Must oh disengage from combat so oh Willow can service me.
I'll service ya, girl toy!
Willow!
I'm pretty sure she's OK.
As OK as anyone who had snakes coming out of their mouth.
- What the hell was that all about, Tara?
- Less talk, more running away.
The woods'll give us cover.
Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
- Someone should tell them that.
- New plan.
Let's split up.
No, bad plan.
- I'll take her.
- No.
I can carry her.
I'll keep her safe, Tara.
We should meet up somewhere.
The Magic Box.
Whoever gets there first, call Dawn and Spike.
But, um the Buffybot?
- We can't.
It's lost.
Go!
Xander Xander, where?
Where?
Shush.
We're using our quiet voice, Will.
- Where's Tara?
- Off and running.
- Like we need to be.
We gotta keep moving.
- Moving.
Oh.
Right.
Demons on bikes.
Yeah.
We got trouble.
Right here in Hellmouth City.
- Our own robo-Buffy led them right to us.
- Buffy.
The ritual.
We have to go back.
- Will, I told you - No.
We have to try again.
- We can't.
- We have to, Xander!
She's she's waiting!
She's counting on us, on on me!
I can't leave her there any more.
I won't.
We have to finish.
Sh!
Will the urn of cirrhosis - Osiris?
- Yeah.
It got kinda Broken.
It's broken.
I remember.
So we'll find another one.
Better made.
Anya and I will jump back into the web There is no other one.
OK, then we'll fix this one.
A little tape.
A dab of Krazy Glue.
No.
It's no use.
The urn's defiled.
It's gone.
Nothing.
It was all for nothing.
Buffy's gone.
She's really gone.
Over here!
Stop your moanin'.
Was that really necessary?
A simple "psst" - I'm just sayin' it's rank.
- Get off it, Klyed.
Razor and the others head back to town, leave us to hunt strays Hey!
You got a bug up your crack, you take it up with Razor.
Until then you do as he says, and shut your hole, before I rip you a new one.
Ah, screw this.
Let's get outta here.
Let's go hit some stores.
Doesn't sound like they found Willow and Xander.
Did he say stores?
Hitting stores?
Does that mean looting?
I think I think the woods let out over this way.
We should keep off the streets, take alleys if we can.
They can't loot the magic shop.
Not now.
I just got it.
Let's go.
You don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?
Couple of stakes holy water, one cross Ow!
Brilliant.
Here!
You want me to bloody thump you?
I told you, stay away from the window.
- Who are they?
- Hellions.
Real pirates.
They raid towns.
Use'em up, burn them down.
It's usually backwaters, any place - Any place they think is vulnerable.
- They know the Slayer's gone.
We can't stay here.
- I'm not goin' out there!
- Got no choice.
Can't protect you here.
- We can lock the doors, turn out the lights.
- And hide under the bed?
It's not my style.
But we need to wait for the others, and Buffy ..
bot.
You know, the Buffybot.
- We have to wait to see if the others - Look!
Dawn, I get that you're scared.
But I'm your sitter, so mind me.
I'm not gonna let any of those buggers lay so much as a warty digit on you.
Right?
- Right.
- Right, then.
We can't wait around to see if the others'll pop in.
We're on our own.
No one's coming to our rescue.
Willow!
Xander!
- They're not here.
- Oh, thank God.
- No, I mean, my store hasn't been looted.
Yet.
- Xander.
- They're all right.
- Where are they?
Why aren't they here?
- I don't know.
They could be hurt.
Xander could be lying somewhere, bleeding, calling my name.
- Anya.
- Like that.
Oh, God!
What if they're really hurt?
What if they're dead?
- They're not.
- How do you know?
Because he's with Willow.
And if something happened, I'd know.
And so would you.
- You think?
- I'm sure of it.
They're fine.
They're both fine.
Maybe they got lost in the woods.
The woods?
Are we going back to the woods?
- I hate the woods.
All those woodsy trees.
- No, it's OK.
Lost is good.
Willow and I always know how to find each other.
- With yoga?
- Shh!
Aradia, hear my words.
OK, this is really startin' to grate my cheese.
These woods aren't that big.
Now, I know we've been goin' straight because I've been following the North Star.
Xander, that's not the North Star.
It's an airplane.
Nah, that's not an airplane.
That's definitely a blimp.
But I can see how one would make that airplane mistake.
I can't walk any more.
I need to rest.
- It can't be much further.
- You said that an hour ago.
I just That spell took a lot outta me.
As, for example, snakes?
How come you didn't tell us how much No.
Not now.
- What were we into back there, Will?
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- Do not get all avoidy on me.
- I'm not avoidy, I just We have bigger problems.
Demons.
Demons.
Ah, well, there's somethin' you don't see every day.
- Unless you're us.
- Yeah, and now we're lost, so can we - What's that?
- See?
Avoidy.
Over there, that light.
That one moving towards us?
Incredibly fast?
Hello?
"Hello"?
We're being hunted, and you're hello-ing a strange fast-moving light?
It could be anything.
It's a motorcycle headlight.
No.
Too small.
- Stay behind me.
- I don't Stay down.
I'll take care of this.
- Xander, it's - A bug!
A big fiery bug thing!
- Xander - Get off!
Do fireflies bite?
No, they probably burn, don't they?
They Xander, it's not a bug.
It's Tara.
Come on.
And how long have you known that your girlfriend's Tinkerbell?
What are you doing?
Get away from there.
Do you hear me?
I said get off my property!
Leave us alone.
Get outta here!
Get back.
It looks like they're just wrecking stuff.
No thought other than just destructorama.
What?
Oh, nothing.
Just, uh Iooked like fun.
I'm just sayin'.
It's just with this kinda frolicking goin' on all around town, we're not gonna get very far without Let's fly, pigeon!
Already been looted.
Sorry!
Um Try the appliance store down the block, they've got great toasters.
Anya!
Xander?
- I knew you weren't dead.
- Well, then, why was I so worried?
- Are you?
- Not yet.
But but I will be.
- Where's Dawn and Spike?
- We called the house Maybe they're on their way here.
I mean, this place is NORAD when we're at DEFCON 1.
- OK, I so need male friends.
- We have to go out and look for them.
There's this guy at work I kinda hit it off with.
Tito.
I mean, he seems like a good You were talking about Dawn and Spike, of course.
Question.
You want us to go back out there?
Well, yeah.
Unless somebody's got a better idea.
Well, um, it's just we're minus a Buffybot.
And Spike is missing in action somewhere with Dawn.
And Giles flew away, and, um, well, you you're looking a little magicked out.
An, honey, we're nearing your point, right?
It's just, how are we supposed to fight these guys?
I mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure, but there's a whole cavalcade of demons out there, and, uh I mean, I think this You know, it takes I mean, l We need - Buffy.
- Buffy.
Buffy is not coming back.
We failed.
So we're it, gang.
Xander, grab the weapons.
We're gonna look for Dawn and Spike.
We should go.
They're just getting more and more worked up.
They can't keep it up forever.
Maybe they'll party themselves out, tire of this place and move on.
Say hello to your new home, boys.
This here is a momentous occasion, the beginning of a new era.
No question, the open back roads and highways have been good to us.
But we've got ourselves a juicy little burg here, just ripe for the pickin'.
And I ain't in no hurry to leave it.
Are you?
So, I figure, what better way to kick off our semi-settling-down than with a little christening?
A symbolic act commemorating the new order around here, ridding ourselves of any not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.
All in one quick, really, really violent fell swoop.
Gentlemen start your engines.
Bye-bye, Slayer!
No!
Another one for the fire, boys.
Tear it up.
- Sorry.
- Sorry?
We don't know if the spell would've worked, even if the demons - It would've worked.
- Well, maybe What?
Maybe it wasn't supposed to.
I mean, those demons showing up at the exact wrong time Maybe we really were in over our heads, invoking forces that we have no right to.
Maybe the fates sent down all that destruction on us to stop us.
I mean You mean maybe it was my fault.
No.
No.
- I'm not saying we announce it this second.
- Anya.
I think it would please them to know we're engaged.
And I think Willow in particular could use a real morale-booster.
Can we talk about this later?
But all the excuses for not telling everyone we're engaged are gone.
Aside from hell bikers, there's nothing in our way.
- This is it, you know.
No more surprises.
- Watch it.
It's it's the Buffybot.
Ah, peachy.
No doubt to lead the wild bunch right to us again.
Will, next time it's damaged, couldn't ya programme it to find RadioShack, or Buffy?
- Buffy!
- Buffy!
Buffy!
Where is she?
Buffy?
Buffy, are you?
It's Willow.
Can you hear me?
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing!
She she's she's in shock.
- Her hands are bleeding.
Her fingers.
- She's filthy.
- Oh, no.
- What?
No.
How could we?
So stupid!
Xander!
Our spell.
Our resurrection spell worked like a magic charm.
We brought you back to life, Buffy.
Right where we left her.
Oh, God.
In her coffin.
She had to dig out of her own grave.
Buffy?
Buffy, it's Xander.
We're sorry.
We didn't know.
Buffy!
You aren't reaching her.
She's too traumatised.
Hey, Buffy.
Here's some news that might perk you up.
Xander and I have an announcement.
- Anya!
- What?
I'm just trying to help.
Buffy It's gonna be all right.
We brought you back.
You're home now.
Yeah.
That's it.
You're home.
Yeah.
Welcome home, Slayer.
Alive and kickin' after all!
Well, alive, anyway.
Not lookin' too good, though.
I don't see you winning any beauty contests.
Unless "Miss My-Face-Fell-Off" gets goin'.
Big axe you got there.
The better to cut you down to size, Grandma.
Incendere.
Ah.
- So you got a witch in the mix.
- More than one.
I happen to be a very powerful man-witch myself.
Or male Is it a warlock?
Warlock.
Plus, we have a slayer here, who might actually be looking to eat some brains, so I think a little quiet moseying, no hard feelings, and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you.
Now, my boys see, that's tricky.
They came lookin' for a massacre, and I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddy birthday party.
- Then you'd be wrong.
- Whoa.
Well, I'd better back off, or you might what?
Pull a rabbit out of a hat?
- Don't do that!
Why would she do that?
- Look We don't want trouble.
You don't want trouble.
Of course we want trouble, we're demons.
We're really all about trouble.
Not this kind.
Oh.
I get your point.
Now, let me tell you somethin', children.
We're not gonna fight you.
We're just gonna hold you down and enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
You might even live through it.
Except that certain of my boys got some anatomical incompatibilities that tend to tear up little girls.
So, who wants to go first?
I was really hoping it'd be you.
Does this mean we win?
There.
What's that?
It's just a machine, Dawn.
I know.
Dawn.
You're my sister Dawn.
Where did I go?
What?
Where did I go?
I was here.
Here.
But then I ran away.
- I I don't - No.
Not me.
The other Buffy.
Yes.
The other Buffy.
Buffy?
I don't I don't know where she ran off to.
Maybe Look what those filthy buggers done to you.
Willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna do the trick this time.
Robot's done.
Hey?
Little Bit?
Dawn!
Dawn!
Well, they wanted a massacre.
She's Buffy.
She's herself again.
You're back, Buff, you really are.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Buffy!
- Where's she going?
- Should we follow her?
- I don't know.
- She just needs some time, is all.
The important thing is that she's back.
She'll be fine.
Xander, look out!
Now, what kind of slayer is it runs out on her buddies just when they need her the most?
Obfusce.
Fragilis.
So, witch, got a little power after all.
Well, let's see what tricks you can manage while I choke the life outta ya Tara!
Nobody messes with my girl.
- Tara, nice axing.
- My first.
Buffy.
Buffy no.
Dawnie, I have to.
Buffy?
Buffy.
Buffy.
How?
Is it you?
I mean, really?
What are you?
No!
Don't!
Don't jump, Buffy.
Don't move.
Just walk to me.
Please.
Please?
I'm your sister Dawn.
We were up here together, and then you went away.
And you don't wanna do that again.
I don't know how you're back, but you are.
And, please, just stay still.
Or move.
But towards me.
Because the tower was built by crazy people and I don't think it's holding up very well.
Talk to me.
Say something!
Is this Hell?
What?
Is this Hell?
No!
Buffy, no!
You're here with me.
Whatever happened to you, whatever you've been through it's it's over now.
You're We have to get off of this tower!
It was so clear on this spot.
I remember how shiny and clear everything was.
But now now Buffy.
Please.
Listen to me.
You told me I had to be strong and I've tried.
But it's been so hard without you.
I'm sorry.
I promise I'll do better.
I will!
If you're with me.
Stay with me.
Please.
I need you to live.
Live!
For Buffy!
- Dawn.
- Buffy!
Dawn!
Buffy?
Buffy.
You're you're you're really here.
You're alive, and you're home.
You're home.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - I love you.
The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
Buffy.
No.
No.
- Raising the dead, it feels wrong.
- It is wrong.
She could be trapped.
I'm not gonna leave her there.
Osiris, master of all fate Let her cross over.
- Buffy?
- What's wrong with her?
- She's in shock.
- Who are they?
Road pirates.
They raid towns, use'em up, burn'em down.
You're alive, and you're home.
You're home.
She's at home.
She has to be.
We need to get there, and she'll be there.
- This is the fastest way?
- Absolutely.
I've done a lot of fleeing.
I know all the shortcuts.
Look, fire.
Fire is rarely a sign of imminent safety.
- I wish we were there already.
- Don't worry, I'll get us there just fine.
My senses are primed for danger.
Nothing is gonna I'm OK.
Four.
Four limbs.
At least the demons almost hit you on their way out of town.
Yeah, now that their leader's gone they seem to be making with the big skedaddle.
It was Buffy, right?
We saw her and it was really Buffy?
I think we screwed it up.
She's broken.
No.
She's not broken.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
Probably tortured and It's, like, we don't even know how much time has passed there for her, possibly years.
That's not something you just get over.
Oh, my God.
What if she never gets over it?
- And you think of this now?
- What are you thinking?
That that she's not right, or maybe, like, dangerous?
Home.
See?
You're back home.
We're all OK now.
Ow.
- It's different.
- A little.
Willow and Tara live here now, and we we didn't do much.
We moved some of the chairs, and took out some of the little tables, but This is the same.
Except the computer stuff.
That's Willow's, obviously.
We eat at the other end Obviously.
There you are.
Knew you were under that dirt somewhere.
You remember what Mom used to say?
"Either wash that neck or plant potatoes".
Yeah, I never thought it was funny either.
You want to button that, or, um?
Oh.
Ow.
- We'll take care of that after.
- OK.
Here, I'll do the shirt.
And then we'll do your hands.
See how nice you look?
Mom's room.
I know.
It's really different now.
Willow and Tara.
This is their room?
Yeah, well, it seemed to make the most sense.
No one was using it, and it's the biggest.
But, you know, now that you're here, we'll have to figure out something to do.
Buffy.
You wanna, like, stop?
We can we can sit down and talk.
What else is different?
Do you mean about the house, or?
Um Let's see.
Giles.
It's so weird.
He left today.
Because you were He'll come right back.
I'll call him.
Someone'll call him.
- What?
- What what?
- What, um will you say to him?
- What was that?
- It's OK.
It's OK.
Dawn!
Dawn!
Are you there?
It's it's just Spike.
I'm here!
Thank God.
You scared me half to death - or more to death.
- You I could kill you.
- Spike.
I mean it.
I could rip your head off one-handed and drink from your brain stem.
- Look.
- Yeah?
I've seen the bloody bot before.
Didn't think she'd patch up so She's kind of She's been through a lot with the death.
But I think she's OK.
Spike?
Are you OK?
I'm - What did you do?
- Me?
Nothing.
Her hands.
I was gonna fix'em.
I don't know how they got like that.
I do.
Clawed her way out of a coffin, that's how.
Isn't that right?
Yeah.
That's what I had to do.
Done it myself.
Um We'll take care of you.
Come here.
- Get some stuff.
Mercurochrome, bandages.
- OK.
How long was I gone?
Except today doesn't count, does it?
How long was it for you, where you were?
Longer.
- I got the stuff.
- Is she here?
- She's here.
- We didn't know where you were.
- You ran away.
- Buffy, are you OK?
You knew she was back?
- How did you know?
- You're not a zombie, are you?
Anya!
- What do you know about what happened?
- Hey!
Back off!
You did this.
What did you do?
- A spell.
We did a spell.
- We didn't think it worked.
- Is she going to be OK?
- I'm OK.
I'm gonna be fine.
I remember.
You brought me back.
- What was it like?
- I can't It's OK.
You don't have to talk about this, Buff.
Hey, do you want somethin'?
Anything.
Pizza.
I'll get you pizza.
- Buffy likes pizza.
- She doesn't want pizza.
Guys!
Back off.
Right.
Dawn's right.
We should just be quiet, and let Buffy tell us what she needs.
I I think I just wanna go to sleep.
- That's a good idea.
You should sleep.
- Right.
Long day.
But, Buffy be happy.
We got you out.
We really did it.
- Tired.
- Well, yeah.
I mean, jet lag from Hell has gotta be, you know, jet lag from Hell.
- My room is still?
- Yeah.
Yes.
It's your room.
Well, she's fine.
Normal.
She used to go to bed all the time.
I think Willow's wrong.
I don't think she's particularly normal at all.
Well, she just got back.
Give it time.
I bet in a week she'll be our little Bufferin again.
Oh, yes.
Six or seven days is all you really need to get over eternal hell experiences.
Who's that?
Spike?
What are you doin' out here?
I hope you're not gonna start your little obsession now that she's around again.
- Hey!
- You didn't tell me.
You brought her back and you didn't tell me.
- Well, now you know.
- I worked beside you all summer.
We didn't tell you.
It was just We didn't, OK?
Listen.
I've figured it out.
Maybe you haven't, but I have.
Willow knew there was a chance that she'd come back wrong.
So wrong that you'd have to That she would have to get rid of what came back.
And I wouldn't let her.
If any part of that was Buffy, I wouldn't let her.
And that's why she shut me out.
What are you talkin' about?
Willow wouldn't do that.
Oh.
Is that right?
Look You're just covering.
Don't tell me you're not happy.
Look me in the eyes, and tell me when you saw Buffy alive, that wasn't the happiest moment of your entire existence.
That's the thing about magic.
There's always consequences.
Always!
- Hey.
- So did you get through to London?
Yeah.
He's gonna head back as soon as he can.
I'm not sure, like, maybe a couple of days.
How did he take it?
I'm not sure.
I mean, glad, but kinda weirded out.
Which I get, you know?
Lots of "dear Lords".
And I think I actually heard him clean his glasses.
Are you worried?
Worried?
Tara, it worked fine.
It's all good.
Hey, Will, this is me.
It doesn't all have to be "good" and "fine".
This is the room where you don't have to be brave.
And I still love you.
If you're worried, you can be worried.
Well, I'm not unworried.
I mean, what what happened, that was intense.
That's gotta change you.
When Angel came back, Buffy said he was wild.
Like an animal.
Buffy's not like that.
- Yeah.
- But?
It's just kinda noisy up here tonight, you know?
Yeah?
Is this better?
Yeah.
I think it makes things quieter in here.
You know what I think?
I think we all just assumed crash positions.
Huh?
It's it's like we were all tensed up, like we were expecting it to screw up.
We weren't prepared for it to actually go right.
Yeah.
- Tara?
- Yeah?
If things did go right wouldn't you think she'd be happier?
Like, wouldn't you think she would be so happy that we brought her out?
Sure she is.
You thought she'd say thanks.
Be more grateful.
Would I be a terrible person if I said "yes"?
Give her time.
She'll get there.
Right.
No need to be in a big furry hurry.
Exactly.
I'm sure it's OK.
- Buffy?
- What did you do?
Do you know what you did?
You're like children.
Your hands smell of death.
Bitches!
Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones.
Did you cut the throat?
Did you pat its head?
- The blood dried on your hands, didn't it?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You were stained!
You still are.
I know what you did!
The glass.
There's no glass.
- OK, what in the frilly heck is goin' on?
- Maybe we dreamed it.
Right.
Right.
- Wrong.
Different brains.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, what was it talking about?
Did you understand it?
Well, I understood the words, but No.
- What was that?
- There's something in the house.
What is it after?
Is it Buffy?
- I don't know.
- That's it, I'm gonna call.
I hope Xander's up.
Xander, are you up?
I can't sleep.
Play a word game with me.
Xander, are you awake?
OK, I'm gonna describe an adjective with accurate but misleading clues, and then you have to guess what it is.
- Xander?
Xander?
Huh?
What?
Do what?
That oughta do it.
- Hello?
- Xander, it's me, Willow.
We were just attacked.
Attacked?
A vampire?
No, it was Buffy.
Or something that looked like her.
Like she was possessed.
Then she just disappeared, and we saw something a bit - There's something in the house.
- In the house?
All right, Willow, you need to get outta there.
Just get everyone out.
Wake up Buffy and Dawn.
Don't make a big deal Argh!
Anya!
- Anya!
- Xander?
Xander!
Very bad.
Very, very, very bad.
Bad.
He's all traumatised.
Whatever it is, it's not the traditional haunting, because it's not limited to one specific place, and there's not, you know, a dead person.
- Not any more.
- I bet it's a hitchhiker.
- A hitchhiker?
- Standard way to travel through dimensions.
Some demon-thing sees someone moving between worlds, and grabs on for the ride.
You mean like some hell-beastie rode in with Buffy?
Like we're responsible for this?
- Assume crash positions.
- We shouldn't have brought Buffy back.
I knew it was gonna end badly.
I should've said so.
OK, fine, but what are we gonna do?
I'm feelin' the need for some vigorous doin'.
It's OK.
We just kill the beastie and then all is good.
We're rolling in puppies!
- Right?
- Can we do that?
Kill it?
- Are we killing somethin'?
- Buffy!
You're not supposed to be up.
How are you feeling?
Are you OK?
- So what are we killing?
- A demon you brought back with you.
- Oh.
- It's not like she's making it sound.
A little haunting-type stuff.
Boo, scary.
Everything's normal.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Um, I remembered something last night.
Uh Buff?
The photographs.
Of us.
- They changed.
- How did they change?
They were dead.
I mean, we were dead.
Like, um dead bodies?
But but then they were OK.
So, I just, you know, figured it was me.
That I was going crazy.
Well, maybe you are.
Going crazy.
From Hell.
No.
You're fine.
You are.
And, Buffy, we're we're so glad.
Yeah.
This thing, this haunting thing, we'll fix it, and then we'll still have you back, which is - It's so important.
- Yes.
It's wonderful.
We should get to work.
- What's the list?
- Possible hitchhikers.
Demons that might have come outta Hell at the same time Buffy did.
"Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons, Skitterers, Large and Small Bone-Eaters".
I say we go with the Small Bone-Eaters.
Well, that just means they prefer to eat things with small bones, like you.
That's just what we have so far: five species of demons that have been known to move transdimensionally.
Two of them may be invisible in this dimension, and two others can perform spells to alter perception.
That's four.
What's the other one like?
Like the others, only dripping with viscous fluid.
Ew!
So, should we concentrate on how to kill those, or should we try to find more?
I'm not sure.
Maybe some of us can keep going finding more, and the others I miss Giles.
Oh.
He's coming back.
I talked to him.
I know I'm a kind of poor substitute, but until then, we'll get it done.
I think I should patrol.
I know we'll find something soon.
Yeah.
- Do you want us to go with you?
- We can do that.
No.
I need to go.
- Sorry.
- You should go.
I'll be safe here with the others.
Don't worry about me.
I found one of those 24-hour places for coffee.
Remember that bookstore?
They became one of those books-and-coffee places, and now they're just coffee.
It's like evolution without the getting-better part.
Coffee, coffee, coffee, hot chocolate for Dawn.
- You're too young for coffee.
- Idiot.
You can have my coffee.
All of you did it.
You stupid children.
Did you think the blood wouldn't reach you?
I smell the death on you.
Look at what you've done!
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
- Dawn!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That was it.
Like Buffy, with fire.
- Is she OK?
- Did I look like that?
I hope I didn't.
No, I'm sure you looked really glamorous cutting up your face.
What is it?
What's happening?
- You'll be OK.
- I bet you'll experience some dry-mouth.
Fire.
Was it?
Did the demon thing have me?
It's OK.
It's OK.
- Yeah, it's gone.
- Yes, but where did it go?
I mean, evil things have plans.
They have things to do.
Buffy?
You should be careful.
You never know what kind of villain's got a knife at your back.
- Your hand is hurt.
- Hm.
Same to you.
Right.
Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't she?
Bringing you back.
It's hard to get a good night's death around her.
You can sit down.
Your furniture.
You should see the downstairs, too.
It's quite posh.
I do remember what I said.
The promise.
To protect her.
If I'd have done that even if I didn't make it you wouldn't have had to jump.
But I want you to know I did save you.
Not when it counted, of course, but after that.
Every night after that.
I'd see it all again.
I'd do something different.
Faster, more clever, you know?
Dozens of times, lots of different ways.
Every night I save you.
It's getting light out.
Buffy's probably on her way home from patrolling.
I like sunrise better when I'm getting up early than when I'm staying up late, you know?
It's like I'm seeing it from the wrong side.
Hey, Tara, this is probably crazy, but Spike got me to thinkin'.
This spell we did, it's having consequences, isn't it?
I mean, it sure seems like it.
And I was just wonderin' - Did you know that this might happen?
- No.
Do you think?
Could someone have known?
Willow is a talented witch.
She'd never do anything to hurt anyone.
I know, I know, huh?
Backin' up quickly, hands in the air.
- I just meant that - Thaumogenesis!
- She's possessed.
- Thaumogenesis.
- You're right.
- I'm not possessed.
I think I figured it out.
This demon, it's not a demon we let out.
It's a demon that we made.
We made a demon?
Bad us.
Thaumogenesis is when doing a spell actually creates a being.
In this case it was like a side effect, I guess.
Like a price.
What?
Think of it like, the world doesn't like you getting something for free, and we asked for this huge gift - Buffy.
And so the world said "Fine, but if you have that, you have to take this too".
And it made the demon.
Well, technically, that's not a price.
That's a gift with purchase.
But if we made the demon, how come we can't see it?
I mean, all we see is us doing stuff.
Well, I think it's out of phase with this dimension.
Its consciousness is here, but its body is caught in the ether between existing and not existing.
It doesn't have a body, so it's borrowing ours.
It borrowed Dawn and Anya.
Or it's manifesting copies of them, like it did when Buffy came at us.
It's using them to do stuff.
To scare us, attack us.
So we need to uncreate it, right?
We need to send it the rest of the way out of our world.
Uh-huh.
Except that it's linked to the spell.
So if we sent it away it would be like the spell didn't exist.
Like it never happened.
Like it never brought Buffy back.
Yes.
You can't do that.
You can't think for a second that you're going to do that.
Dawn If you think you can give her back to me and then take her away again?
No.
That's worse than if you'd never brought her back.
You can't mess with people's lives this way!
- Dawn, we're not going to do it that way.
- How can you let her do this?
How can you even talk about letting her go?
Honey, you weren't listening.
We will find another way.
- We will.
- Then do it.
Wait.
OK, wait.
Dawn, everybody, hold on.
What?
Why are you smiling?
That's inappropriate.
- Because it's temporary.
- What is?
The demon.
It's gonna dissipate.
The only way for it to survive on this plane is if it were to kill the subject of the original spell.
It would live if it killed Buffy?
Thanks for the tip.
You don't belong here.
Did they tell you that you belonged here?
Did they say this was your home again?
Were you offered pretty lies, little girl?
Or did they even give you a choice?
- Xander!
Drive faster!
- I can't!
- I could drive faster and I can't drive!
- She's right, you're like a snail.
A snail driving a car very slowly.
Give it the left foot!
We've gotta help Buffy with the demon you sent her.
I did not send the demon, I was possessed.
- The demon used me to eavesdrop on us.
- Great, so now what?
We have to talk in some sort of anti-demon secret code?
Ood-gay idea-yay, An-yay.
Stop talking wrong in Pig Latin and drive!
Buffy's in trouble!
It's OK, Dawnie.
Willow and Tara are doin' a spell.
- You sure it won't send Buffy back?
- No, of course not.
It's just that she can't fight it if it's all misty, so they'll make it more solid, so Buffy can kick its fully embodied ass.
You sure it'll work?
Child of words, hear thy makers.
Child of words, we entreat.
With our actions did we make thee, to our voices wilt thou bend.
With our potions thou took motive, with our motions came to pass.
We rescind no past devotions, give thee substance, give thee mass.
You're the one who's barely here, set on this earth like a bubble.
You won't even disturb the air when you go.
Go!
Take Dawn out of here!
Child of words, hear thy makers.
Child of words, we entreat Solid.
That's probably the sort of thing I'm not supposed to see, right?
- Dawn!
- What's wrong?
Lunch.
You made me lunch?
Wow.
Thanks.
You'd better go.
You've been outta school since I got back.
And you know what they say.
Those of us who fail history?
Doomed to repeat it in summer school.
Thank you.
You OK?
I'll start charging money for every person that asks me that.
- Everyone's been doin' that, huh?
- A little bit.
It's because they care about you a lot.
When you were gone It was bad when you were gone.
But it'll be better now.
Now that they can see you being happy.
That's all they want.
- Buffy!
Hey!
- Hey, you get Dawn off to school all right?
Cos I was thinkin', if you need help picking her up, l It's OK.
I got it.
Look, you guys, um there's this thing so I'm just gonna say it.
You brought me back.
I was in a I was in Hell.
I, um I can't think too much about what it was like.
But it felt like the world abandoned me there.
And then suddenly you guys did what you did.
It was Willow.
She knew what to do.
OK.
So you did that.
And the world came rushing back.
Thank you.
You guys gave me the world.
I can't tell you what it means to me.
And I should have said it before.
You're welcome.
Welcome home, Buffy.
Buffy.
- Spike, it's daylight and you're - Not on fire?
Sun's low enough.
It's shady enough here.
I was gonna go in, but I overheard you lot exchanging a special moment.
I came over a bit queasy.
Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug?
I just wanted a little time alone.
Oh, uh right, then.
It's OK.
I can be alone with you here.
Thanks ever so.
Right.
Buff?
Slayer?
Are you OK?
I'm here.
I'm good.
Buffy, if you're in if you're in pain, or if you need anything, or if I can do anything for you You can't.
I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment.
I was happy.
Wherever I was I was happy.
At peace.
I knew that everyone I cared about was all right.
I knew it.
Time didn't mean anything.
Nothing had form, but I was still me, you know?
And I was warm.
And I was loved.
And I was finished.
Complete.
I don't understand theology, or dimensions, or any of it, really but I think I was in heaven.
And now I'm not.
I was torn out of there.
Pulled out by my friends.
Everything here is hard, and bright, and violent.
Everything I feel, everything I touch.
This is Hell.
Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that.
Knowing what I've lost.
They can never know.
Never.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Mom?
I'm sorry.
Your mother's dead.
Anya, you wanna marry me?
"I've gone.
Not one for long goodbyes, I thought it best to slip out quietly".
"Love to you all.
Giles".
There he goes.
Guys, I need you on board here.
This is deep stuff, Willow.
We're talking about raising the dead.
It's time we stopped talking.
What if something does go wrong?
I can do this, I promise.
But not without you.
Osiris, here lies the warrior of the people.
Let her cross over.
Release her.
It was Buffy, right?
We saw her and it was really Buffy?
- I think we screwed it up.
- No.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some Hell dimension.
She's been through a lot.
What did you do?
I haven't been to a Hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment.
Wherever I was I was happy.
I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there by my friends.
Everything here is hard and violent.
This is Hell.
So we meet at last, Mr Drippy.
- Want me to call a plumber?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- Got the number.
- Dawn, I'm on it, OK?
Ah!
There.
All better.
Man.
How much water can they fit in one set of pipes?
If I understand right, the entire city water supply.
- It's like little clown cars in the circus.
- Told you we should've called the plumber.
You were right.
Plumber will make everything good.
Dawnie, you're not eating breakfast.
Dawn, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
It's unbelievably important.
You should eat breakfast at least three times a day.
I'll, um grab something before school.
And a big Sunnydale round of applause for Tito the Amazing, plumber extraordinaire.
How's it look down there?
Like we should start gathering up two of every animal.
Basically, your pipes are shot.
The whole system's gonna have to be replaced.
What you need is a full copper re-pipe job.
Full copper re-pipe?
That sounds potentially pricey.
Well, if you have any questions, our number's on the invoice.
That's a weird phone number.
Oh, wait.
Is that the bill?
Hey.
Tito cut you a good deal.
Those are his bargain prices.
- I did a little haggling for you.
- Thank you.
So we'll pay him.
What's the big deal?
Buffy, I know you're still getting back on your feet after Lying flat on my back?
Yeah.
But there's some money stuff we're gonna have to talk to you about.
OK.
So you're telling me I'm broke?
- Not yet, but - Money's definitely becoming an issue.
As in your being almost out of it.
But I haven't spent any money.
I was all dead and frugal.
I know this comes as a bit of a shock after a bit of a shock.
It took us by surprise too.
Your mother prepared everything really well.
She had insurance Life insurance.
Which should have left you covered, but hospital bills.
- Pretty much sucked up all the money.
- Which you're still haemorrhaging.
- How am I doing that?
- No, not you.
The house.
See, this house, just sitting here, doing nothing, by itself costs money.
So what do we do?
Easy.
We burn the house to the ground and collect the insurance.
Plus fire - pretty.
You guys, I'm kidding.
OK, it's bills, it's money.
It's pieces of paper sent by bureaucrats that we've never even met.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Which is too bad, you know, cos that I'm really good at.
I'll take care of this.
I promise.
I just don't know how yet.
I know how.
If you wanna pay every bill here, and every bill coming, and have enough to start a nice college fund for Dawn, start charging.
- For what?
- Slaying vampires!
You're providing a valuable service to the whole community.
I say cash in.
Well, that's an idea you would have.
Any other suggestions?
Well, I mean, it's not so crazy.
Yes, it is!
You can't charge innocent people for saving their lives.
- Spider-Man does.
- He does not!
- Does too.
- Does no Xander?
"Action is his reward".
Why don't you ever take my side?
What are you talking about, taking your side?
Anya, I am your side!
You're throwin' away a gold mine.
Come on.
Wait up.
Anya!
What's wrong with you?
Ask your best friend Spider-Man.
If you won't support me I'm totally supportive!
I'm a flying buttress of support!
No, you're not.
This is because I haven't told them about the engagement.
No Maybe Yes.
It's painful and confusing!
I mean, first you give me this beautiful ring, and then I can't wear it in public.
Do you know how depressing that is?
Anya, I promise, your waiting days are almost over.
I know it's frustrating, but the way I understand this marriage thing, it's kind of a forever deal.
Not if you never get started.
Don't you wanna get married?
Yes.
So then why won't you tell them?
Because I'm still getting used to the miracle of a steady pay check and getting out of my parents' house.
And this this husband thing, it's a big step.
Or a lot of little ones.
And I love you so much.
I just want every step to be just right.
Really?
Hey!
You tricked me!
Just now, with your fancy talk and lips!
You keep doing this, and I keep forgetting, and you keep stalling!
- Anya!
- When are you gonna grow up, Xander?
There's a first time for everything is my philosophy.
This is my first big loan.
Collateral?
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
I love that tie.
I'm a problem solver.
Let's crunch those numbers!
Stupid skirt.
- Hello.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Carl Savitsky, loan officer.
- Buffy Summers, loan applier-for.
I didn't know what you would need, so I brought everything.
- I'm very responsible in that way.
- OK.
I don't think I'll need this or these.
Old report cards definitely not.
So, about my getting a loan Yes, well, um it looks as if, financially, we have a bit of a tangle.
I know.
And I figured you could just cut through that tangle with scissors.
You know, where the loan is the scissors?
Ms Summers, the only collateral you have is your house, which was never fully leveraged and has been losing equity over the last several years.
For some reason, Sunnydale property values aren't competitive.
Refinancing's out of the question.
Are you saying you won't give me my loan?
Well, the problem is you have no income.
No job.
No job?
I wish.
Hey!
Are you in the wrong line?
That's for deposits, that's withdrawals, and this one is for getting kicked in the face.
Stupid skirt.
May l?
Put the girl down.
These things?
Never helpful.
Now, about my loan.
I'm not saying I'm charging you for saving your life or anything, but Let's talk rates.
He still turned you down?
That's crazy!
Even if the bank did get robbed, which you battling demons couldn't possibly know, you would think there would be some kind of reward.
They're, like, "We won't give you money unless you prove you don't need it".
What kind of system is that?
You're askin' the wrong gal.
Hey.
Buffy, you're mad.
You noticed.
It'll pass.
No.
Anger is a big, powerful emotion you should feel.
Well, that's good then.
- It's gone now.
- OK, let me make you mad again.
Uh Ready?
Last semester, I slept with Riley.
- And, you know, I really doubt it.
- Caught me.
Big fib.
To cover up the sleazy affair I had with Angel.
Will, what the hell are you doing?
- Pissing you off.
- Yes, true.
Why?
Well, cos you know since you've been back, you haven't exactly been big with the whole range of human emotions thing.
What do you mean?
Well, you haven't No, I mean, it's just, um You know, this is really my problem.
I'm just I'm all over the place.
You should just forget I even said anything, cos Well, cos you know banks, man.
Don't be such a wiener dog.
Look at them.
Researching demons for the billionth time.
They could use a peppy boost of happy news.
You're right.
I'll tell them.
- As soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
- Chicken.
- Will you stop?
- Dare you.
Anya, if I tell them we're engaged right after you dared me to, wouldn't you always wonder if that's the only reason I did it?
Oh.
Score one for Captain Logic.
No, no.
Captain Logic is not steering this tugboat.
I smell Captain Fear at the wheel.
God, I hate this.
This tone in my voice?
I dislike it more than you, and I'm closer to it.
Oh, come on, Tara.
I am so old enough to do research.
Do you really think I'm not mature enough?
I think you're very mature for your age, but you're still only 15.
Right.
15, as in teenager.
You know, if you don't let me look at the pictures, I'm gonna learn everything I know about demons on the street.
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.
See?
No biggie.
I can totally handle it.
That's a weird place for a horn.
That's not a horn.
You know, I still don't get it.
What kind of a demon would rob a bank?
- The kind that wants money.
- What do you even call that?
This?
I'm guessing on how you say it.
It's got an apostrophe.
I think it's M'Fashnik.
Like "Mmm, cookies".
Or maybe M'Fashnik.
Like "Muh Fashnik".
This your guy?
You do research now?
Want a cappuccino and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?
- Would you just look at the picture?
- Not the profile for your typical bank robber.
Maybe they turned down his loan application.
That's him.
Big bad.
This thing was strong, guys.
- No weapons that I could see, but still ..
real dangerous.
Oh, God, Buffy!
You're alive.
You're here.
And you're still remarkably strong.
Huh?
Oh.
Sorry.
Willow told me, but I didn't let myself believe it.
I take a little getting used to.
I'm still getting used to me.
It's You're - A miracle.
- Yes.
But then I always thought so.
So I can start.
How was England?
How was Life?
I'm not really sure how to answer that.
Well, I arrived home.
I, uh, met with the Council - Always a good time.
- Yes.
Otherwise, there's nothing really to report.
I, um keep a flat in Bath.
I met with a few old friends.
Almost made a new one, which I think is statistically impossible for a man of my age.
- And now you're back.
- Yes.
Wow.
Giles, are you miserable about it, or just really British?
I can't lie to you, Buffy.
Leaving Sunnydale was difficult.
And, uh coming back is I'm guessing the word is "inconvenient"?
No.
Bewildering?
And how are you really?
- You look tired.
- Me?
Nah.
Fine.
I mean, you know, sleeping's hard, but just because of the whole waking up in a box thing.
So maybe waking up's the problem - but just for a second.
I sleep OK.
Great, even.
Except, you know, for the dreams.
You seem to be doing remarkably well under extreme circumstances.
I'm proud of you.
Well, actually it wasn't me.
Willow brought me back.
I just lay there.
- No, I meant - I know what you meant.
It was just a little post-postmortem comedy.
Well, l better start prepping.
Slayage.
- Yes, there is always that, isn't there?
- Seems that way.
Giles!
We're so glad to see you.
We missed you.
- You can't have the store back.
- I know.
Do we have information on this new demon that I suddenly find desperately interesting?
- That we do.
- This one robs banks.
Oh.
I found him.
- M'Fashnik.
Oh.
- Aha!
Like "Mm, cookies".
- No, quite different, actually.
- You know it?
By reputation.
They come from a long line of mercenary demons that perform acts of slaughter and mayhem for the highest bidder.
Well, it is the American way.
Yes, but the question now becomes what's powerful enough to control one of those things?
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted, now give me what I want - the head of the Slayer.
- OK.
- Sure.
We can do that.
You hired me to create chaos and carnage for you.
Told me you were powerful men, commanding machines, magics, the demon realms below.
- We are.
- We're, like, super villains.
- Which one of you is the leader?
- I am.
- I will kill the leader.
- He is.
- I will kill you all.
- Wait!
No fair!
It's not our fault the Slayer was there.
- We said we'd pay you, and we're gonna.
- Yes!
Truly, Lord Jonathan is the wisest of us all.
Yeah, long live our noble lord and master.
You guys suck.
You can't pay me with paper, tiny king.
You pitted me against the Slayer.
For that, I must kill you.
Then I will suck dry your bones and use them to beat your subjects to death.
Whoa, whoa!
Big guy, hey.
Let's back things up a parsec.
You kill us everybody loses.
You let us live, we give you - Give me what?
- Name it!
Well, between the three of us, we can pretty much do anything.
Like if you want a spell to make you look super cool to the other demons?
- I'm all over that action, my friend.
- Or, just throwin' it out, robot girlfriend?
For those long, lonely nights after a hard day's slaughter?
You could do this?
Don't trust him.
Robo pimp-daddy's all mouth.
Shut up!
You're just mad I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci.
- You owe me, man.
- Or else what?
You'll train another pack of devil dogs to ruin my prom?
Graduated!
That wasn't me.
How many times do I have to say it?
- The prom thing was my brother Tucker.
- Yeah, well, tell him I was at that prom.
Hello!
Screen wipe, new scene.
I had nothing to do with the devil dogs.
I trained flying demon monkeys to attack the school play.
School play, dude!
- That was cool.
That was kinda cool.
- Everyone was, like, "Run, Juliet"!
Enough!
Nothing you can offer me will satisfy your debt to me.
I don't want your toys, or your spells, flying monkey demons I want the Slayer dead!
- OK.
- Done.
One dead Slayer comin' up.
Could you give us a minute?
For what?
Well, we really wanna nail down the optimum method for us to wipe out the Slayer for you.
Make sure it involves pain.
I know they're so cute you could die, but it's all I got.
Think nothing of it.
It's, um whimsical.
They were mine when I was little.
Couldn't find the guest sheets.
Mom always did this stuff.
They don't actually fit.
I blame the sofa.
We need one of those pull-out kinds.
The kind with no payments till two-thousand-and-infinity.
What?
Oh, it's just money stuff.
It turns out Mom left me some, and, while I was dead, it got squandered on luxuries like food and clothing.
How bad is it?
Anya says pretty bad.
I'm kinda taking her word for it.
- Actually, I'm trying to not think about it.
- Sound policy.
At least for tonight.
Figured I'd put it out of my mind, you know, take a break, get some perspective.
And then wake up at 4am terrified.
You're putting too much pressure on yourself.
I mean, to return from some unknown level of Hell It's only natural that coming back will be a process.
In the meantime, I'm scaring people.
Well, that can take time too.
Well, if it's any consolation, life can be pretty overwhelming even for people who haven't been where you have.
I guess.
Tomorrow morning, you and I will sit down and go through everything.
Every bill, one by one.
We'll work it out together.
I'm glad you're back.
Well, I'm glad you are too.
Are we really gonna kill her?
- That's so sad.
- Shut up, Whine-athan.
But I don't want to kill Buffy either.
Yeah, she saved my life a bunch of times.
Plus, she's hot.
- It's her or us.
We have to do it.
- We're talking about murder.
No, we're talking about staying alive, and as this is my mom's house, what I say goes.
But aside from the moral issues, and the mess, we can get in trouble for murder.
Duh!
The last I checked, the authorities also frown on bank robbery too, you genius!
I don't even know if we could kill Buffy.
She's got super strength.
Killing people this is not why we got together in the first place.
Yeah.
We teamed up with one clear, super cool mission statement.
Remember?
So you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
OK.
- Of course I remember.
It was last month.
- Then you know we have a mission!
Shrink rays, trained gorillas.
Workable prototype jetpacks, and chicks, chicks, chicks.
- I know that's the action I signed on for.
- Me too.
Ixnay on the urder-may.
- Vote.
- OK.
Who's for not killing Buffy?
Agreed.
So what are we gonna do about this M'Fashnik guy?
Ah!
Wait here, OK?
I got an idea.
Here's the Slayer's name and address.
You wanna kill her, make it so.
How'd you make him do that?
What are you, some kind of Jedi?
The Force can sometimes have great power on the weak-minded.
Hm.
Hey, Giles.
You have a good talk with Buffy?
Yes, now she's back.
- Isn't it awesome?
- Mm.
Tell me about the spell you performed.
Oh, OK.
First of all, so scary.
Like, the Blair Witch would have had to watch like this.
And this giant snake came out of my mouth, and there was all this energy crackling, and this pack of demons interrupted, but I totally kept it together.
And then, next thing you know, Buffy.
You're a very stupid girl.
What?
Giles Do you have any idea what you've done?
The forces you've harnessed, the lines you've crossed?
I thought you'd be impressed or something.
Oh, don't worry, you've made a very deep impression.
Of everyone here, you were the one that I trusted most to respect the forces of nature.
Are you saying you don't trust me?
Think what you've done to Buffy.
- I brought her back.
- At incredible risk!
Risk?
Of what?
Making her deader?
Of killing us all, unleashing Hell on Earth.
Shall I go on?
No!
Giles, I did what I had to do.
I did what nobody else could do.
Oh, others in this world can do what you did.
You just don't wanna meet them.
No, probably not, but well, they're the bad guys.
I'm not a bad guy.
I brought Buffy back into this world, and maybe the word you should be looking for is "congratulations".
Having Buffy back in this world makes me feel indescribably wonderful, but I wouldn't congratulate you if you'd jumped off a cliff and survived.
- That's not what I did, Giles.
- You were lucky.
I wasn't lucky.
I was amazing.
- How would you know?
You weren't there.
- I'd have stopped you.
The magics you channelled are more ferocious than anything you can understand, and you are lucky to be alive, you rank, arrogant amateur!
You're right.
The magics I used are very powerful.
I'm very powerful.
And maybe it's not such a good idea for you to piss me off.
Come on, Giles.
I don't wanna fight.
Let's not, OK?
I'll think about what you said, and you try to be happy Buffy's back.
We still don't know where she was or what happened to her.
And I'm far from convinced she's come out of all this undamaged.
Hello, Spike.
You hear all that noise?
Just enough to make me feel crappy.
You know Watcher-boy doesn't mean anything by it.
I guess.
Everyone They all care.
They all care so much, it makes it all harder.
I'm not sure I followed you round that bend, love.
I don't know I just I feel like I'm spending all of my time trying to be OK, so they don't worry.
It's exhausting.
And then l And that makes them worry even more.
You want me to take them out?
Give me a hell of a headache, but I could probably thin the herd a little.
Knew I could get a grin.
Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
Cos that's when you're alone, I reckon.
I'm not one for crowds myself these days.
Me, neither.
That works out nicely then.
So what do you know about finances?
Dawn?
- Couldn't sleep?
- Not really.
You?
Evidently not.
You ever try mixing parts of every cereal you got in one bowl?
Does it work?
Gonna find out.
Wanna come join the experiment?
Why don't I be your control group?
I find as you get older that you lose patience with throwing up.
- Is that locked?
- It should be.
You're not the Slayer.
But you'll do for a start.
You're payin' for that door, buddy.
Oh!
Table!
- You have cost me, Slayer.
- I cost you?
That's a designer lamp, you mook!
Spike, no!
I want him in the kitchen!
Open the door!
The basement!
I'm takin' him down.
No!
Full copper re-pipe!
No more full copper re-pipe!
Whoa.
Did you know this place was flooded?
I think we got a lot to feel good about.
We got the money, we got the lair And our one loose end has been taken care of by the Slayer.
Flame-thrower's up.
Periscope's working.
Looks like your mom's weeding tulips again.
Action figures fully deployed.
I still can't believe it.
We did it!
We can do anything.
- We could stay up all night if we wanna.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Don't get all crazy on us, Andrew.
- I was only saying.
What are we gonna do about Buffy?
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gotta come after us.
- Bring her on.
- We could hypnotise her.
Make her our willing sex bunny.
I'm putting that on the list!
Is this the life, or what?
I mean, we got all the stuff we ever wanted, and we didn't even have to - Earn it?
- Exactamundo.
It's true, my friends.
The way I see it, life is like an interstellar journey.
Some people go into hyper sleep and travel at sub-light speeds, only to get where they're going after years of struggle, toil and hard, hard work.
- We, on the other hand - Blast through space-time in a wormhole?
Gentlemen, crime is our wormhole.
But everyone knows, if the width of a wormhole cavity is a whole number of wavelengths plus a fraction of one, the coinciding particle activity collapses the infrastructure.
Dude, don't be a geek.
- This is gonna take forever, isn't it?
- Not forever.
Just a very long time.
Here it is.
Your first approximation of your spanking new debt.
I've trashed this house so many times.
How did Mom pay for this?
For starters, she saved money with this crappy-ass coffee table.
- Well, there's always that charging option.
- No!
I will definitely probably not be doing that.
Well, I know I'm back in America now I've been knocked unconscious.
Thank you.
Poor lumpy Giles.
What do you think the demon wanted anyway?
Aside from costing you a bundle.
Don't know.
Now he's way too dead to answer that question.
- Wish I knew who hired him.
- Ooh, I could do a locator spell.
Or not.
That's it.
It's been four hours.
I'm calling it, people.
This coffee table, it's gone.
Damn it!
Also, this lamp's in critical condition.
Well, let's take these things out to the trash and give'em a decent throwin' out.
Buffy - I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.
Your mother dealt with this sort of thing all the time.
She took one crisis at a time, without the aid of any superpowers, and got through it all.
So can you.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
Who's calling me?
Everybody I know lives here.
I'll be back.
I bet it's creditors.
The hounding's begun.
I read about it.
- So you think we'll starve?
- I very much doubt it.
No chance I'd have to quit school to work in a poorly ventilated sweatshop?
Poorly ventilated What have you been reading?
Buffy, what is it?
Angel.
- Is he in trouble?
- He knows that I'm He needs to see me.
I have to see him.
Of course.
You'll leave for LA tomorrow.
Not LA.
And not here.
Somewhere in the middle.
- There's a place.
- I see.
Well, we should get these bills out of the way I have to go now.
Um Thanks for taking care of this for me.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Hey, Mom.
Mom?
Mommy?
There's some money stuff we have to talk to you about.
You're telling me I'm broke?
- Hospital bills.
- Pretty much sucked up all the money.
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.
So you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
OK.
We're, like, super villains.
Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
Cos that's when you're alone, I reckon.
I'm not one for crowds myself these days.
- Me neither.
- That works out nicely then.
Buffy, what is it?
Angel.
He needs to see me.
I have to see him.
You'll leave for LA tomorrow.
I have to go now.
- Hello?
- Buffy?
Yep, it's me.
I brought dinner.
Deep-fried chicken parts.
Hope you're hungry.
- You already ate.
- No!
Well, uh yes, obviously.
We didn't know when you'd be coming back.
It's OK.
More for me.
I don't know about you, but I would love some chicken.
- Yes.
As would l. - I'll take a drumstick.
I'm a breast girl myself.
But then again you knew that.
- So - What so?
So, how was it?
Seeing Angel.
Him seeing you.
Was it weird?
Um It was intense.
- Well, if you wanna talk about it - I don't.
It's not important.
Past.
I'd just rather keep this one to myself, if that's OK.
Sure, whatever.
Buffy, there was some discussion, in your absence, about, um what you're gonna do now.
Your plans.
Oh, I've been giving that a lot of thought actually.
- I think I've figured out what I should do.
- Good!
That's good!
I figure, if I hold off paying the plumber, I can pay the utility bill.
- I can wait to reshingle the roof until - I meant with your life.
Oh.
Life plans.
Um Well I have no idea.
I guess, um Well, I left school, you know, when Mom got sick, but I always figured I'd go back.
And then she Um So I was thinking about re-enrolling, but I missed the registration cut-off.
Busy being dead and all.
If it's too late for late registration and too early for early, you can always come to classes with Tara and me.
Right.
You can audit for the rest of the semester until registration.
Audit.
I guess I could do that.
Yeah.
It sounds like a good plan.
What do you think, Giles?
The Slayer always knows what she's doing.
Sharp.
Decisive.
Always with a plan.
We'll never be the crime lords of Sunnydale with her one step ahead of us.
That's why we're throwing tests at her, seeing which one of us can shake her up, maybe find a weakness or two.
- She's ready.
- Sweet.
Run me through it.
We got nine surveillance cameras hooked in - super wide-angle, infrared, auto-iris - six types of audio monitoring, filtered through a dual quad DVR system Yeah, yeah.
Fine.
Just tell me.
Are you sure we'll be able to watch Buffy without her noticing?
Absolutely.
She'll never even know What the hell is that?
Death Star, dude!
Wicked, huh?
Thermal exhaust port's above the main port, numbnuts.
I'm using the Empire's revised designs from Return of the Jedi.
- That's a flawed design!
- Hey!
OK.
Since we're messing with the Slayer, who could pummel us all into a sludgy substance, it might be a good idea for us to not draw attention to ourselves!
- I could paint over it if you want.
- Yeah, do that!
This time tomorrow, the games begin.
And the Slayer will never even know what hit her.
This is gonna be great.
I thought it might be a little weird being back.
It is weird, but a good kind of weird.
There's the teacher, Mike.
You'll like Mike.
You call your teacher Mike?
Boy, school sure has changed since my day.
Social construction of reality.
Who can tell me what that is?
Rachel.
A concept involving opposing theories: one stressing the externality of social reality from individuals.
And the flip side?
Steve.
Each individual participates fully in the construction of his life.
Good.
And who can expand on that?
- Chuck.
- Well, those Will, I'm not following this too well.
Oh.
The trick is to get in the rhythm.
Kinda go with the flow.
That would be easier if your classmates weren't such big brains.
Buffy, that's ridiculous!
They are no smarter than you or me.
Willow.
Because social phenomena don't have unproblematic objective existences, they have to be interpreted by those who encounter them.
Nicely put.
So, Ruby, does that mean there are countless realities?
What?
You're not dumb.
Just rusty.
Maybe I should ease back in with classes like Introduction to Pies, or Advanced Walking.
- Hey!
How'd it go?
- She did fine!
- Sociology, not a big fave.
- She didn't like Mike?
No, it's fine.
I just need to spend more time reacclimating, to get back into the swing Hey!
You could at least say sorry, rude-o!
Everybody's in a hurry.
Hans 7, this is Logan 5.
I'm in position, do you copy?
Yeah, Warren, we copy that.
And you're up on the monitor.
Hey, Warren, this is working great.
Runner is tagged, inhibitor is on.
Initiate omega pulse sequence.
My art appreciation class doesn't start for 20 minutes, so we've got some time to kill.
Here.
You'll like it.
It's very mellow.
..
didn't think she liked my cooking until I realised that was her yummy face.
- What was that?
- What was what?
Uh that noise What was that about cooking?
Whose yummy face?
Willow.
Wow.
You really got engrossed in that Renaissance book.
I guess.
I must have spaced out.
I do that sometimes.
Once Willow and I were watching - Buffy!
Are you coming?
We're gonna be late for class.
What the?
- Is it working?
Is it doing it?
- Dude, it's doing it.
It's wicked cool.
Tara!
Tara, wait!
Buffy, where were you?
You missed art class.
Missed?
Tara, something freaky's going on.
It's like I'm Look, there!
There!
Did you see?
Crap!
Tara!
Tara, wait!
That noise.
There's something on me.
- Oh, no.
- Uh-oh.
She found it.
- Oh, this is bad.
- This is bad.
- Self-destruct!
Self-destruct!
- I don't know, l OK.
Score me.
Right.
50 points for ingenuity.
- Another 30 since there was actual contact.
- Very smooth.
- On the freak-o-meter, she was at a six.
- Come on, it's an eight, easy!
We'll split the diff, call it a seven, which is good for 140.
- Giving you a grand total of - 220.
- Beat that!
- Oh, I will.
I will.
This is gonna be great.
Diving into the workforce.
Being a breadwinner.
Building things with my hands.
Actually, you won't be building so much as lifting and toting.
Toting?
It's just a temp gig, Buff.
You know, unless it tanks.
Since you're not union, I had to call in a few favours to get you on a crew.
I appreciate it.
Muchly.
You saved me from having to accept work at the Magic Box.
I mean, retail?
Yeee.
I'd rather be dead.
Again.
Uh-huh.
So, Giles have any thoughts about your fast-forward freak-out at school?
No.
Well he implied that maybe it was stress-related.
Like I was imagining it or something.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I guess I could have been blacking out.
But there was this thing on my sweater, and then it just blew away, or went poof.
Maybe it was lint.
Maybe it was evil lint.
OK.
First tip of the day.
When I introduce you to Tony the foreman, you might wanna leave out stuff about blackin' out and evil lint.
Hey, Tony.
This is Buffy.
You know, that friend I told you about.
Nice to meet you, Tony.
- Guys.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
We're a week behind, I got two men out, and you want us to baby-sit a little girl?
- Excuse me, but l - Hang on, Gidget!
This stinks, Harris.
What am I gonna do with her?
Give her a chance.
She's stronger than she looks.
That's the spirit!
Don't mind him.
He may seem pig-ignorant, rude, and a little hostile.
Have fun!
- Where are you going?
- I need to supervise the Sheetrock hangers.
Don't sweat it!
I'll be back and check on you later.
Danny, finish putting in those J-boxes.
Vince, Marco, I need you to haul the steel inside.
I don't know, Tone.
Don't wanna get in trouble with affirmative-action lawyers.
Why don't you put little Britney here on hauling duty?
It's Buffy.
OK, princess, you're on it.
Try not to break a nail.
Don't worry.
And don't let them hassle you into hurting yourself.
These beams weigh quite a few hundred pounds.
Which way?
Thanks!
I'm just trying to learn everything I can.
Cos I don't want just a job.
I want a career, something I can grow into.
I never thought of working in construction, but it kinda Hey.
We get paid by the hour.
You wanna ruin it for the rest of us?
Slow down.
Ah!
Got visual of subject, four o'clock.
- That's not four o'clock.
- It is if you face the front of the van.
But we're not, we're facing out that way.
That's 12, so she's at two o'clock.
- Look, she's over there, OK?
- OK.
You're up.
Ooh!
Oh.
Jumpy.
What's the matter?
I scare ya?
Hey!
- Oh, man.
She took'em out.
- Let me see.
- Give it back now.
- I'm still looking.
- No, you had your turn, now gimme - No, I'm still Duck!
Hey.
All you said was lose the mural.
Oh, my God.
Buffy, what What happened?
How I know they can be jerks, but was it necessary - I didn't do that!
- I'll tell you what she did.
I came over to tell her I was impressed by the job she was doing, liking the way she handles herself, and suddenly she goes berserk and attacks me.
Wh?
I saved you from the The demons!
There were three big apey things!
No.
Not here.
Not at my job.
That's your job.
I can't help where the forces of darkness attack me.
Buffy, look at this mess.
Do you have any idea how much it's gonna cost to repair this?
What do I say to the clients?
Show'em the demon bodies, say it's their fault?
You can't.
They melted.
But there are witnesses!
Vince!
You can tell him, right, how I jumped in and protected you from those things?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
All I know is you were losin' it.
- That time of the month, huh?
- What?
!
You were huddled in a corner, crying like a baby!
Hey, hey.
No way.
Me, crying?
You're trippin', sweetie.
What's her problem?
- I didn't imagine this, Xander.
- I know.
I believe you.
I think, between this and the school thing, somebody's messin' with you.
- They're connected?
- There's somethin' going on.
I think it's worth checking out.
You need to see Giles, get on it right away.
I'd start with lD'ing those demons.
- You're firing me, aren't you?
- Big time.
The whole melty thing oughta help narrow it down.
Uh try sketchin' em.
That always helps.
When I get off work, I'll help you go through the mug shots.
This is gonna be great.
I've always been interested in, um interested in retail.
Is this all research or just some kind of stress test for the table?
I just want to be thorough.
This time anomaly and the demon attacks could be completely unrelated events, but if they're not, you might be in some danger.
So, situation normal then.
Let's review.
You record returns here.
These are for special orders.
You ship them wherever the customer wants.
- And these are the hold slips.
- Fill out two hold slips for each item.
Oh, and be sure to remove the items from the shelf.
I can illustrate with an amusing story about a crystal.
See, there was this certain customer who had wanted to purchase a sapphire.
Sapphire.
Well ding-dong.
Right?
And so anyway This is so dull I might actually have fallen asleep and be dreaming, you guys.
Why is the Slayer here anyway?
She's a student, she's a construction worker, and now she's some kind of selling stuff person?
It's like she's completely without focus.
Shall we check the other channels for free cable porn?
Guys, I'm ready.
- I need you to hold hands.
- With each other?
Well, you know what homophobia really means about you, don't you?
Stop touching my magic bone!
Shut up.
OK.
OK.
It's in Latin, so don't laugh.
It's supposed to sound like this.
Opus orbis est, et ea in medio.
Tempus ad calcium intendet.
Buffy, a word in your ear.
While I was running the store, I found it useful to imagine myself back in the library.
If you concentrate on service and not on making a sale, you're more likely to have a satisfied customer.
- Guess I'll have to find my own style.
- Yes.
Quite right.
That woman.
Go sell her something.
Miss?
Which candle creates a more, you know, romantic atmosphere?
Hmm.
"Lemon Seduction".
Eugh!
"Essence of Slug".
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Yeah - May I help you?
- I need something for a prosperity spell.
I heard you have it.
A mummy hand?
Uh Yeah, actually, I saw one downstairs.
It's kinda hairy, though.
Maybe it was a daddy hand.
I'll just get it.
Petrified hamster.
Ugh.
Eyeballs in honey.
Dagger of Lex Ooh.
Ancient mummy hand.
And you get the dagger of Lex for free with it!
See the inlaid mother-of-pearl underneath the black oozing goo?
This hand is dead.
The power is gone.
I'm not giving you money for this!
Oh, it's just playing dead.
Little scamp.
Buffy, a word in your ear.
- While I was running the store - Huh?
What?
Huh?
..
to imagine myself back in the library.
We did this just now.
Giles, something is happening.
Yes.
Oh, quite right.
Oh, you did it!
Dude, she's looping.
- What'd you do, enchant the hand thing?
- Well, not exactly.
I made it so she had to satisfy a customer with a task that resists solving.
- Maybe I should've done more.
- Like what?
I don't know.
Like make her kind of itchy?
- Go help the lady who just came in.
- Wait Don't worry, don't be nervous.
Do what I do - just picture yourself naked.
Miss Hi.
I'm looking for something really specific.
I heard you carry it.
A mummy hand.
You look like the mummy hand type.
Sorry, I can't get that for you.
I called here 20 minutes ago, and someone said you had one.
Yeah but there's a thing happening.
You have one and I was told I could buy it, and I'm sorry but I'm really gonna have to hold you to that.
I'm not leaving until I get a mummy hand.
OK.
I guess I'll have to get it for you.
Smart.
She's figuring out the game.
Satisfy the customer.
- She might have you beat there, Stretch.
- No way.
She hasn't even started yet.
Hope she solves it faster than Data on the ep of TNG where the Enterprise kept blowing up.
Or Mulder, in that X-Files where the bank kept exploding.
Scully wants me so bad.
- Fingers sold separately.
- Where are you going?
- Lady needs a mummy hand.
What?
You haven't even talked to her yet.
I could explain, but you would just forget it.
I'm worried about you.
Retail is a fast-paced and exciting world.
I mean, has this whole day gone by too quickly for you?
No.
No, I don't think that's exactly the problem.
Buffy, a word in your ear.
If you think of the store as a library, it'll help you to concentrate on service rather than selling.
Yes.
And then I'm going to marry Bob Dole and raise penguins in Guam.
Yes.
Quite right, yes.
Miss, l Mummy hand, right?
You got it, lady.
Miss - Miss?
- Hi.
If you like slug, go with slug.
She's not gonna sleep with you anyway.
- This mummy hand has ceased to be!
- It is an ex-mummy hand!
Buffy, a word in your ear.
It's you.
You're doing this!
I know we promised you a mummy hand.
It's just I can't get it for you.
Um There's something wrong.
It's defective.
Defective?
Are you sure?
There must be something you can do.
But there's no way to get to get that hand.
I can special-order one.
We can deliver it anywhere you want.
Really?
Thank you for shopping at the Magic Box.
Oh, yes!
So, Warren had 220, and I had that bonus for getting her fired.
But the biggest component has to be how long it took.
Mine took the longest.
Only if you're external to the time loops.
From Mr Giles' perspective, it was shortest of all.
- So what do we do?
- Oh, it's obvious.
It's not over.
Buffy, your first sale!
Congratulations.
You didn't charge for delivery.
Oh.
Well, first day These things happen.
Yeah, I'll just take it out of your pay.
Yes, I'm sure Buffy would understand that.
Absolutely.
This is gonna be great.
Life is stupid.
I have a dim memory of that, yeah.
And I didn't figure you were here cadging my whiskey cos life is full of bloody peaches.
There's this thing.
Someone's doing stuff to me.
Messing up my life.
Except that it was kind of pre-messed already.
You know, with school and jobs.
It was pretty bad even without the evil.
So you're gonna let this whoever play you till it figures out what kills you?
- Giles is workin' on it.
- Oh, good.
Giles rules the mighty force of library books.
- You'd do better?
- Damn right!
I'd hit the demon world.
Ask questions, throw punches, find out what's in the air.
It's fun too.
It's not my kind of fun.
Yeah.
It is.
Your life will be a lot less confusing when you figure that out.
You have had so too much to drink at this point, I am cuttin' you off.
You're not a schoolgirl.
You're not a shop girl.
You're a creature of the darkness, like me.
Try on my world.
See how good it feels.
Are there drinks in your world?
- The motorcycle was loud.
- Sssspike.
The usual, Dave, and one for the lady.
We're heading for the back room, pet.
Where the real action is.
These lowlifes know everything that happens in town.
Oh, good.
These are the lowlifes.
Fine.
A little louder.
Boys, what's the game?
You know the game, Spike.
You in?
He kills our kind.
Don't let him in.
- Oh, ask him if he's heard about - Later.
You're gonna play cards?
I need a moment with my lady.
You wanna play, that's fine.
I am sticking to the original plan.
- Which one do I kill for information?
- Listen.
These guys talk while they play.
We'll get more information out of their mouths than out of their corpses.
I'm in.
Everybody OK with that?
Ante up.
You play for kittens?
!
So, who's gonna advance me a tiny tabby, get me started?
- Come on, someone's gotta stake me.
- I'll do it!
What?
You thought I was just gonna let that lie there?
- Where are we going?
- To Final Jeopardy, where Buffy's the one in jeopardy.
We're really super villains now, like like Dr No.
Yes, back when Bond was Connery, and movies were decent.
Who remembers Connery?
I mean, Roger Moore was smooth.
You're insane.
You're short, and you're insane.
I like Timothy Dalton!
Hey!
Don't make me pull over, OK?
- You're lucky today, Spike.
- Got my good-luck charm with me.
- You cleaned us out.
No one's that lucky.
- Yeah.
I'm startin' to think you cheat.
Me?
I cheat?
He's got x-ray vision.
- I'm not using it.
- We are not the ones who were cheating!
I had no idea that was there.
I could have leaned on that days ago.
You better go, Spike.
Things could get ugly.
Got ugly the second he walked in.
Him and his human.
Her skin's so tight, I don't even know how you can look at her.
Leave your winnings and get out.
We'll forget this whole thing.
Ah, so it's a setup, isn't it?
Squeeze a few quid outta the vamp.
- Well, you didn't count on me and the bird.
You wanna fight, you face the two of us.
What?
I'm not getting into a bar fight!
I'll beat'em up for information, great, but not to defend your rights to gamble for kittens!
- Which, by the way, is stupid currency.
- They're delicious!
Come on, Slayer, a big fight's just what you need.
Forget it.
I'm not playing by anyone else's rules any more.
I'm done.
- Hey, I won those!
- Scamper!
Be free, kittens!
The money's gettin' away!
- What's wrong, love?
- What's wrong?
You were gonna help me!
You were gonna beat heads and fix my life!
But you're completely lame!
Tonight sucks!
And look at me!
Look at stupid Buffy!
Too dumb for college.
And freak Buffy - too strong for construction work.
And my job at the magic shop?
I was bored to tears even before the hour that wouldn't end!
And the only person that I can even stand to be around is a neutered vampire who cheats at kitten poker.
- Oh, you saw the cheating, did you?
- Also I think you're drunk.
- Connery is Bond.
He had style.
- Yeah, but Roger Moore was funny.
Moonraker?
The gondola turns into a hovercraft?
It's retarded.
Besides, the guy had, like, no edge.
Dalton had edge.
In Licence to Kill he was a rogue agent.
That's edgy.
- He was amazing in The Living Daylights.
- Which was written for Roger Moore!
This is stupid!
We're wasting time.
End of discussion.
There were pigeons doing double takes when the gondola blasted by!
Moonraker is inexcusable.
That van.
You wanna steal a van, I'm with you, love, but we have got the motorcycle.
I've seen it before.
At the construction site.
Connery is the only actor of the bunch.
Timothy Dalton should get an Oscar and beat Sean Connery over the head with it!
- OK, that's it.
- Hey!
Stop it!
Guys!
Look!
- She's coming over here!
What do we do?
- Jonathan, grab your magic bone.
You have discovered me!
But do not try to defeat me, for I have been testing you and I know your weaknesses.
Ooh!
Oh!
I'm OK!
I'm fine!
Get off me!
I am well struck!
I call on the misty portal to my demon dimension, where I'll lay my head and gently die!
He blew up.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw.
He's gone.
I love it, you know.
It makes you feel all powerful.
Strong Kinda sick.
- She hurt me.
- Someone'll see you!
Get in the back.
- I won't fit.
- Well, do the thing.
Oh, right.
Let the spell be ended!
Ow Oh, next time I do that spell, one of you guys has to look like the demon.
The Slayer touched you.
Yeah, it was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists.
I only looked big.
I actually had the proportional strength of me.
Guys, think about this.
We took on the Slayer.
We've got lots of stuff in the computer now.
Speed, strength, reaction time We're getting what we need to be a threat to her.
We tested her, faced her and we survived.
Unless I have internal injuries that will kill me.
Of course.
But, barring that, Warren's right.
We did good!
The Trio versus the Slayer.
It's not over.
Plus, look what Warren and me discovered by accident!
- What?
- Free cable porn!
Feel any better?
I think at one point I actually turned completely inside out.
But, yeah, better.
I'm sorry I didn't find this demon with my research.
Oh, it's OK.
It wasn't much of a fight.
I got lucky.
- I'm really screwing up, Giles.
- What?
Come on.
You were being tested sequentially by some unknown demon.
I don't call that screwing up.
No, it completely is.
- I let the demon set the rules.
- Go easy on yourself, will you?
You don't have to figure the whole thing out at once, you know.
The job and everything.
You're pushing yourself too hard.
The nice people at the phone company seem to think it's not hard enough.
Well, maybe there's something I can do about that.
This is, um I It's for you.
A cheque?
This is too much.
I can't take it.
- Well, tear it up then.
- No!
I was just being polite.
I'm taking the money.
This is great.
This is more than great.
I don't really know how to say this, but it's a little like having Mom back.
In this scenario, I am your mother?
Wanna be my shiftless absentee father?
Is there some sort of, um rakish uncle?
I'm just saying thank you.
So much.
I'm gonna show this to Dawn.
She loves it when things get easy.
I just wanna tell you that, um this makes me feel safe.
Knowing you're always gonna be here.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Anya!
What's wrong with you?
First you give me this beautiful ring, and then I can't wear it in public.
- Don't you wanna get married?
- Yes.
Come on, Tara!
I am so old enough to do research.
You do research now?
Want a cappuccino and pack of cigarettes to go with it?
- Why should I care about any of this?
- Because they'll take you away!
If I can't make you go to school, then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
Since you've been back, you haven't exactly been big with the whole range-of-human-emotions thing.
I know you'll never love me, but you treat me like a man.
Everything on this table's half off.
Buy one eyeball, get the second one free!
Arr!
Careful, me mateys!
These be fireflies spat from a volcano off the coast of Katmandu.
Arr!
You're not a real pirate!
Real pirates live on boats and don't look stupid!
Ha-ha!
Oh, a salty swabby!
Maybe you be fishing for the taste of me hook!
Hello, Ahab.
A little help, please?
Arr, and help ye shall have.
Arr!
- So what are you supposed to be?
- An angel.
- Oh.
Shouldn't you have wings?
- No.
This is a special kind of angel, a Charlie.
We don't have wings.
We just skate around with perfect hair, fighting crime.
- Where's your costume?
- Like I'm six years old?
Halloween's so lame.
But you get to dress up and play games.
Xander's gonna teach me a new one - Shiver Me Timbers.
Ever play?
Dawn, Willow could use some help in Magical Texts.
I'm all over it.
- And you?
Ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
- Not really much for the timber.
I'm just saying, you might rethink the stereotype before someone turns you into a toad.
And why don't you try removin' that broomstick from your Dawn.
Hey.
Don't stop the invective on account of me.
If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotten teeth Excuse me, do you have any candy corn?
Oh, look at you!
You are just the cutest thing!
- But I thought you said - I know.
But look, with the hat and the wart.
Oh!
Let's go fill your tummy up with sugary nibblets, OK?
Buffy.
We're running low on mandrake root.
Check the basement.
Don't blame me if we have this conversation over, and over, and over, and over, and over.
Oh!
Bell.
Neck.
Look into it.
- Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
- What are you doing, lurking down here?
Came through the tunnels.
Runnin' low on burba weed.
Stir it in with the blood, makes it all hot and spicy.
What?
I was gonna pay for it.
I mean, no, I was gonna nick it, cos that's what I do.
I go where I please and I take what I want.
I thought you'd had it with Customer Disservice.
One-time deal to help out.
And I mean straight time, no loop-de-loop mummy-hand repeat-o-vision.
Where's the mandrake root?
Only three to a jar.
Tend to go a bit wonky if you cram them too close.
Thanks.
Feel like a bit of a rough-and-tumble?
- What?
- Me you.
Patrolling?
Hello?
Oh.
Uh, I should stay.
Maybe tomorrow.
It's not like I don't already have plans.
Great Pumpkin's on in 20.
So much easier to talk to when he wanted to kill me.
Oh!
Go help Giles.
- What happened to Xander?
- He kept poking me with his hook.
I sent him to Charmed Objects.
With any luck he'll end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a 50-foot Giles that squishes annoying TV pirates.
- We've got a ton of bagging to do here.
- Spike had a really good idea.
- Maybe I should patrol.
- You've patrolled every night this week.
Besides, it's Halloween, the one time that supernatural threats give it a well-deserved rest.
As should you.
What about costumes that take over your personality?
Or Irish fear-demony thingies?
If anything calamitous happens, history suggests it'll happen to one of us.
Right, exactly.
So I should patrol to avoid any of that And I'm bagging.
Da da-da, da da-da da-da, happy Halloween Give you something special this year.
Come again.
In a zillion years.
Store go boom.
Arr!
That was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.
Except for that.
What you all did for me tonight.
- The heaps of money you helped me Us acquire.
All I can say is, I hope we make as much tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Oh, post-holiday clearance.
- The cornerstone of retail.
Brooms all round, then.
Or I could whip up a jaunty self-cleaning incantation.
It'll be like Fantasia.
And we all know how splendidly that turned out for Mickey.
I think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
And you have more fingers.
Which is good, cos then there's no need to wear those big white gloves to overcompensate.
If you had a real peg leg, you wouldn't just have a lame costume.
- You'd actually be lame, which is different.
- You do this every night?
Every time I close out the cash register.
The dance of capitalist superiority.
I'm gonna marry that girl.
What?
!
She's 15 and my sister, so don't even Oh.
Hey, everybody.
Can l, uh?
There's something Anya and l wanna tell you.
Now?
Now.
- We're getting married.
- Oh, my God!
Congratulations!
That that's Wow!
It's a big wow.
I thought you were waiting for the right moment.
I did.
Here, have some money!
Did you know about this?
No.
Not unless I blocked it from my memory.
Much as I will Xander's vigorous use of his tongue.
Is that why you clean your glasses?
So you don't have to see what we're doing?
Tell no one.
Giles, this is We have to do something.
He said he couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me.
Then he gave me this.
- Which I'll be paying for the rest of my life.
- Can I try it?
Oh, absolutely not.
Where I come from, this sort of thing requires much in the way of libation.
- God save the Queen!
- Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy.
- You caught us with our parties down.
- That's OK.
This is the first premarital celebration.
There'll be lots more.
With gifts.
Maybe we'll even decorate for the next one.
Why wait?
Kaz-ah-ree-tah-tay talmine.
This is so much better than the way it usually looks.
Thank you.
The grocery store's still open.
We could've bought decorations.
Why bother?
These are perfect.
And extra biodegradable-y.
In a couple of hours, poof!
No, they're great.
It's just Why use magic when you can do something naturally?
Well, you can fight monsters naturally, with sticks and stones.
Don't recommend it, though.
- It's different.
- How?
Becau Because you're protecting people.
Keeping them from being hurt.
Which makes them happy, like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
That's not the point, Will.
- Why are you being like this?
- This isn't about me.
This is so about you.
You're always coming down on me for doing magic that couldn't harm a fly.
What's your problem?
Willow, I wish that you would stop and think about what you're Sorry.
Just checking on the chips.
It's OK.
We're done.
You're getting married!
You!
- Me.
Choking.
- Oh, sorry.
I can't believe it.
It seems like only yesterday you had to pay a girl to date you.
Like I'd ever pay.
Define "date".
I was only gone for three months.
How many other things have changed?
- I got a tattoo.
- What?
!
Which is why we told her no.
- Just a little one?
- Over my dead body.
The kind that doesn't come back.
Fine.
Congratulations.
You're very lucky.
Finding a guy like him.
Not as lucky as me.
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Oh!
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
Remember?
- That's tonight?
- No.
It's on the other Halloween.
Come on, you said I could.
Well, I know I did.
It's just, you know, with Xander's party We're good.
But you have to get us extra gifts for our reception.
Yes, please.
- I don't know.
Giles?
- It's really not up to me.
Come on.
It's four blocks away.
I'll walk straight over.
Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets.
Please?
Hello?
Hey!
- Perve.
- Sorry.
I thought Oh!
Hey, Summers.
Did you get over the wall OK?
Yeah.
My sister thinks I'm staying at your house.
The Mominator thinks I'm staying at yours.
Can't believe they fell for that one.
Like, own a TV!
So where are we meeting?
The park.
That's where all the monsters gather on Halloween.
Hoo-hoo!
To infinity and - Ow!
- Oops.
Nice shot.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- What took you so long?
- Had to stop for crimes and misdemeanours.
Zack, this is my friend Dawn I told you about.
Hello.
Hey.
Justin.
I know.
I've seen you around at a couple of parties.
I've seen you, too.
Hey, we'll catch you guys later.
Alone at last.
So, what do you guys wanna do?
Yeah!
Three points!
Whoo!
- Witches don't really look like that.
- You got a lot of witch friends?
No.
I mean, from stuff that I've read and stuff.
Some are supposed to be really pretty.
Don't get them mad New target.
Come on.
So?
He's OK.
"Ho-hum" OK?
Or like "Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna pee my pants" OK?
Pee.
So what's the verdict, captain?
Little Justin in love?
I don't know.
- She's cute.
- Congratulations for having eyeballs.
What about, you know, going all the way?
Do you think that that the moon and the stars look lovely tonight?
Hey, you think after this juvie crap we can do something else?
I'm getting kinda bored.
Just one more.
Anya is a wonderful former vengeance demon.
I'm sure you'll spend many years of non-hell-dimensional bliss.
- Is she moving in with you?
- Uh With your combined incomes, you might think about a down payment on a house.
- Like the kind you live in?
- No rush.
I'm sure you've plenty to think about with the wedding.
You've got the rest of your lives to plan the rest of your life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No way.
You know who lives there?
- Old man Kaltenbach.
- Crusty old bastard.
- Isn't he supposed to be mental?
- Total loony tunes.
Pumpkins.
Very dangerous.
- You go first.
- Huh, screw that!
Show us how brave you are.
Let's see those cute little girlie guts.
Lay off, man.
- I'll do it.
- Go, Dawn.
Look, you don't have to do this.
It's OK.
I want to.
Shouldn't oughta mess with those.
Sometimes they bite.
- Get away from her.
- Don't make me go kung fu on you, man.
Come on inside, kids.
Got something special for ya.
Daddy's got a treat.
Cool.
No, no, no.
We are so not going in there.
Dawn, tell them.
- Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
- Used to design'em, back in'58.
Nothing would give me more pleasure than to see a child's face light up when he'd open one of mine on a Christmas or a birthday.
I was good.
Jeepers, I was the best.
And then that thing happened.
One little mistake and they took it all away from me.
They They took my toys.
Time for the treats!
Who wants to help Daddy in the kitchen?
How about you, Sally?
Sally's not much for the cooking.
Why don't I give you a hand?
Hands are good.
Always use more hands.
More hands.
I say we get the funk out of here before Satan Claus stuffs us up the chimney.
And miss the big treat?
That would break the old guy's little heart.
- Assuming it's still beating.
- We should get Justin and go.
Come on, the dude's 1,000 years old.
What's he gonna do?
Drown us in his drool cup?
Hey.
Where's its head?
Boo.
- What the hell was that?
Justin?
Justin?
Let's go.
- What happened?
- I swiped his wallet.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Dude, that guy was rank!
Bet a spritz of Dawn'll wash that right out.
So what do you think?
Lunchables?
Or should we go all the way and turn'em?
I was thinking maybe a June wedding.
But they always had the highest percentage of calls for vengeance.
So as soon as possible.
Mortal life being so short, we gotta cram in as much marital bliss as we can before we wither and die.
There's just so much to consider.
Planning the wedding, new cars, house and babies.
You have to plan for babies, or they'll just run roughshod over your entire existence.
Yeah.
You gotta know what to call'em before they hit college.
Rupert is an exceptionally strong name.
If we want our progeny to eat paste and have their lunch money stolen.
All that matters is that they're happy.
Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
I know.
I mean, I am the luckiest ex-demon in the world.
To find the one person in all dimensions that I was meant to be with, and have everything work out exactly as I dreamed.
I mean, how often does the universe allow that to happen?
Air.
Sweet mother oxygen.
You OK?
Yeah.
I just It's just that I didn't think it would be so much.
But this is good.
I mean, this is love and celebration and moving forward.
Anya's right.
This is the way life's supposed to work out.
Right.
Deep pools of ooey delight.
- I'm wallowing, not drowning.
- Definite wallow action.
OK.
So, once more into the breach?
Oh, I think my breeches are wearing a little thin.
I'll take Spike up on that offer to patrol.
Gotta be something out there cruisin' for a smack-down.
So, you're what?
A sophomore?
- I wish.
- Ah!
Freshman.
Yep.
Way down there at the bottom of the rung.
Actually, kinda under those rubber feet that keep the ladder steady.
Hey, those are important.
Here.
Spoils of war.
You earned it.
- I did?
- Yeah, for keeping me steady.
- And so begins your life of crime.
- Hm.
You're a little late.
- I steal all the time.
- Really?
Totally.
I haven't paid for lipstick since forever.
Oh, be still my heart.
Cute and bad.
Yeah.
Bad to the bone.
More like frozen.
Here.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure, Ms Summers.
Hey.
Where's Zack?
- He went to get the car.
- You guys got a car?
Thanks for the ride.
- I'm losing her pulse.
- Let's get her in!
Summers residence.
Oh, Mrs Penshaw.
No, Dawn said she was staying the night at your house.
Yes, I realise that now.
But I don't believe that you called to check No, all right.
Let's just, um OK, if I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Hey!
We were just getting our dance on.
It was Janice's mother on the telephone.
Janice said she was staying here.
Ahh.
They're dipping into the classics.
You gotta respect that.
- Is Buffy still outside?
- No.
She went to go find Spike to patrol.
It's always nice to be kept in the loop.
Um Xander, Anya, stay here in case Mrs Penshaw calls.
Willow, Tara, check downtown.
I'll swing by Spike's.
See if I can catch Buffy.
Don't do nothin' I would, dude.
You're it.
I love it when they run.
So.
Yeah.
Ooh.
It's cold.
You OK?
You want this back?
Nah.
Cold doesn't really bother me.
What are you?
Superman?
No.
But I do have a few special powers.
Hey, um, does this work?
You gotta turn the ignition.
I love this one.
Yeah.
Another thing we have in common.
- You're shaking.
- It's cold.
You wanna go?
No.
It's just, um What are you expect?
Shh.
I just wanna taste you.
Shiver me timbers.
What?
Um, nothing.
Just - Wow.
- Oh, my God.
That was your first.
What?
No!
It was.
That was your first kiss.
I've been kissed before.
I kiss all the time.
Not that I'm a kiss slut.
Just, you know, with the lips and the pressing together and stuff?
Hey, expert here.
OK.
OK, it was my first kiss.
I know, I know.
I suck.
My lips are dry, and my tongue's all horrible and sticky.
And I'm pretty sure I drooled on you, so just please tell me how awful it was.
It was perfect.
Do they know they're brother and sister?
Do you think she's here?
What?
Do you think Dawn might have come here?
It's where I'd be if I were 15 and on the lam.
Really?
Well, not me at 15, cos "Hello, spaz".
- You?
- Yeah.
Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama came from humble, geek-infested roots.
Infested roots?
Trying to turn me on?
I have to try now?
Come on, let's look over here.
Do you see her?
No, there's too many people.
- Maybe we could ask Security to - No.
That'll take too long.
One among many.
Many fade to one.
- What are you doing?
Will!
- I'm just gonna clear the crowd.
How?
I'll just shift everyone who isn't a 15-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
What?
It'll be for a fraction of a second.
They won't even notice.
Will, no, you can't!
- Why?
- What if something went wrong?
- Well, it won't!
- But what would Giles say?
- Se-cot!
- Are you taking his side now?
- This isn't about sides.
You two have been talking about me behind my back.
- No!
God!
- You know how that makes me feel?
You are using too much magic.
What do you want me to do?
Just sit back and keep my mouth shut?
That'd be a good start.
If I didn't love you so damn much, I would!
Ta-cullum.
- Tara!
Ow!
Sorry.
It's OK.
Long as it's not bleeding.
Justin, could we?
It's just God, you are so beautiful.
Get your gear together.
We need to Spike?
You know, in civilised cultures, that's called trespassing.
Good thing you're uncivilised.
We got trouble.
- Giles found you?
- Giles?
No.
Was he looking for me?
- Yeah.
It's Dawn.
- Dawn?
What happened?
It's OK.
Giles was here earlier, looking for you.
Dawn and a little friend pulled a Houdini.
Up to a bit of candy-corn mischief.
Wait.
She's out there, running around by herself?
Kids these days, eh?
I did a sweep of the tunnels.
Giles is poking about the cemetery.
- We have to find her.
- I don't think she's in there.
Mist.
Cemetery.
Halloween.
Should end well.
Bloody brilliant.
Dawn!
- Dawn, are you all right?
Janice?
- He bit me.
That jerk bit me!
Like you weren't askin' for it.
- I feel certain she wasn't.
- What do you know about it, grandpa?
Quite a bit, actually.
Dude, that sucks.
Dawn?
Where's Dawn?
- Get off me!
- Dawn, wait!
Wait!
I thought we could hang out, or something.
- Hang out?
!
- Yeah.
I mean, you're not like other girls.
You're different.
There's something special about you.
I knew it the first time I saw you.
- I just wanna be close to you.
Shh.
It's OK.
It'll only hurt for a second.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
Giles?
Oh!
You have a choice, son.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard What were my choices again?
So, this a private game or can anyone join in?
Dawn, are you?
Were you parking, with a vamp?
I didn't know he was dead!
- Living dead.
- Shut up!
- How could you not know?
- I just met him!
So you were parking in the woods with a boy you just met?
- We've seen each other at parties.
- Shut up.
I don't believe you.
Oh, like you've never fallen for a vampire?
- That was different.
- It always is when it's you.
Excuse me!
Can we fight now?
Didn't anyone come here to just make out?
Ah, that's sweet.
You run.
You scream.
Die, Slayer!
Mm-hm.
Your sister's the Slayer?
I totally get it!
I knew there was something about you.
Giles!
What is your malfunction, man?
!
It's Halloween, you nit.
We take the night off.
Those are the rules.
Me and mine don't follow no stinkin' rules.
We're rebels.
No.
I'm a rebel.
You're an idiot.
Give the lot of us a bad name.
- Trick or treat.
Give me somethin' good to eat.
I thought you really liked me.
I do.
And you like me, too.
I do.
- Sorry about the party.
- Nah, don't worry about it.
It gave me more time to plan the bridal shower.
Where do we order muscular male strippers?
Anya!
I'm kidding.
Jeez.
I guess I should bugger off.
Somethin' about big bads not venturing far on Halloween.
Good fight.
So, big monster bashing?
Sorry we missed it.
As long as Dawn's all right.
- Yeah, that's what's - I think I'm gonna turn in.
Good night.
Tara?
Tara.
- How's your face?
- Oh, still ruggedly handsome.
Grandpa indeed.
Ow.
She's taking it pretty hard.
It's not surprising.
We can't ignore this behaviour.
Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
You're right.
I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
Don't be too hard on her.
OK?
We need to have a conversation.
Is this the part where you tell me you're not angry?
Just disappointed?
Pretty much.
Except for the bit about not being angry.
I'm sorry.
OK?
- It's not that easy.
- What do you want me to do?
Reverse time and take it back?
Cos I could probably - Joke.
I don't think I could really - Can we not do this now?
- I'm tired.
- OK.
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Forget.
Ooh.
Your feet are cold.
- Better warm me up.
- Mm.
This is how every day should always end.
And start.
And all the stuff in the middle.
So, uh, you're not mad?
About what?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Previously: - I love you.
Oh, my God.
Here lies the warrior of the people.
Let her cross over!
I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there by my friends.
They can never know.
We can't ignore this behaviour.
Something needs to be done.
I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
We're getting married.
Willow, you're using too much magic.
- Can we not do this now?
- Forget it ever happened.
Forget.
Every single night, the same arrangement I go out and fight the fight Still I always feel the strange estrangement Nothing here is real, nothing here is right I've been making shows of trading blows Just hoping no one knows That I've been going through the motions Walking through the part Nothing seems to penetrate my heart I was always brave, and kind of righteous Now I find I'm wavering Crawl out of your grave, You'll find this fight just - Doesn't mean a thing - She ain't got that swing Thanks for noticing She does pretty well with fiends from Hell, but lately we can tell - That she's just going through the motions - Going through the motions Faking it somehow She's not even half the girl she Ow!
Will I stay this way for ever?
Sleepwalk through my life's endeavour?
- How can I repay - Whatever I don't want to be Going through the motions Losing all my drive I can't even see If this is really me And I just want to be Alive - Good morning, Buffy!
- Did Dawn get off to school all right?
What?
Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Respect the cruller.
And tame the doughnut!
That's still funny, sweetie.
So, uh, no research?
Nothing goin' on?
Monsters or whatnot?
Good.
Good.
So, did anybody Last night, you know, did anybody burst into song?
Merciful Zeus!
- We thought it was just us!
- I had my guitar at the hotel - We were talking, then it was like - You were in a musical.
That explains the huge backing orchestra and the dancing room-service chaps.
- We argued, then it rhymed - An entire verse about couscous.
- It was very disturbing.
- What did you sing about?
I don't remember.
But it seemed perfectly normal.
But disturbing.
Not natural.
Do you think it'll happen again?
We should look into it.
- With the books.
- Do we have any books on this?
We break it down.
Look at the factors before it happens again.
I for one I've got a theory That it's a demon A dancing demon No, something isn't right there I've got a theory Some kid is dreaming And we're all stuck inside his wacky Broadway nightmare I've got a theory we should work this out It's getting eerie What's this cheery singing all about?
It could be witches!
Some evil witches Which is ridiculous cos witches they were persecuted Wicca good and love the Earth and women power and I'll be over here I've got a theory It could be bunnies - I've got a - Bunnies aren't just cute Like everybody supposes They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses And what's with all the carrots?
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?
Bunnies!
Bunnies!
It must be bunnies!
- Or maybe midgets - I've got a theory we should work this fast Because it clearly could get serious before it's passed I've got a theory It doesn't matter What can't we face if we're together?
What's in this place that we can't weather?
Apocalypse?
We've all been there The same old trips Why should we care?
What can't we do if we get in it?
We'll work it through within a minute We have to try We'll pay the price It's do or die Hey, I've died twice - What can't we face if we're together?
- What can't we face?
- What's in this place that we can't weather?
- If we're together There's nothing we can't face Except for bunnies - See, OK, that was disturbing.
- I thought it was neat.
So what is it?
What's causing it?
I thought it didn't matter.
Well, I'm not quaking in my stylish-yet-affordable boots, but there's something unnatural going on.
And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
Well, is it just us?
I mean, is it only happening to us?
Cos that would probably mean a spell.
They got the mustard - out!
- They got the mustard out!
It's not just us.
Oh, my God.
You will never believe what happened at school today.
Everybody started singing and dancing?
I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
Oh, my God.
Did it sing?
- So you guys too, huh?
- So what'd you sing about?
Math.
That's right!
The volume.
The text.
What text?
- The volumey text.
- You know.
The mmummrfugh report.
The what now?
There's a few volumes at the house about mystical chants, bacchanals.
- Might be relevant.
- Yeah, we could I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies, so I'm open to anything.
Great.
We'll check it out and we'll give you a call.
Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open.
Do we have any books at all at home?
Who wants to be cooped up on a day like this?
The sun is shining, there's songs going on, those guys are checking you out What?
What are they looking at?
- The hotness of you, doofus.
- Those boys really thought I was hot?
Entirely.
Oh, my God.
I'm cured!
I want the boys!
Do I have to fight to keep you?
Cos I'm not large with the butch.
I'm just not used to that.
They were really looking at me?
And you can't imagine what they see in you?
I know exactly what they see in me.
You.
I lived my life in shadow Never the sun on my face It didn't seem so sad though I figured that was my place Now I'm bathed in light Something just isn't right I'm under your spell How else could it be Anyone would notice me?
It's magic, I can tell How you've set me free Brought me out so easily I saw a world enchanted Spirits and charms in the air I always took for granted I was the only one there But your power shone Brighter than any I've known I'm under your spell Nothing I can do You just took my soul with you You worked your charms so well Finally, I knew Everything I dreamed was true You make me believe The moon to the tide I can feel you inside I'm under your spell Surging like the sea Go to you so helplessly I break with every swell Lost in ecstasy Spread beneath my willow tree You make me Complete You make me complete You make me complete You make me - I bet they're not even working.
- Who now?
Willow and Tara.
You see the way they were with each other?
The get-a-roominess?
I bet they're Singing.
They're probably singing right now.
I'm sure they're making every effort.
- Oh, yeah.
- Xander.
Buffy, it's OK.
I do know about this stuff.
- Besides, it's all kinda romantic.
- No, it's not.
Come on!
Songs, dancing around.
What's gonna be wrong with that?
Aargh!
Argh!
That's entertainment.
You want some breakfast, baby?
- You don't have to go to work?
- Nah, I shut the crew down for the day.
My guys start dancing around me, I don't know if I can deal.
It's a flab thing.
So waffles?
Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
No, I'll only make them for myself, but by California law you will own half of them.
Hey, how about omelettes?
I could do an omelette This man that I plan to entangle Isn't he fine?
My claim to fame was to maim and to mangle Vengeance was mine But I'm out of the biz The name I made, I'll trade for his The only trouble is I'll never tell She is the one She's such wonderful fun Such passion and grace Warm in the night when I'm right in her tight Embrace, tight embrace I'll never let her go The love we've known can only grow There's just one thing that No, I'll never tell Cos there's nothing to tell - He snores - She wheezes Say "housework" and he freezes She eats these skeezy cheeses that I can't describe - I talk, he breezes - She doesn't know what pleases His penis got diseases from a Chumash tribe The vibe gets kind of scary - Like she thinks I'm ordinary - Like it's all just temporary - Like her toes are kind of hairy - But it's all very well Cos God knows, I'll never tell When things get rough, he Just hides behind his Buffy Now look, he's getting huffy cos he knows that I know She clings, she's needy She's also really greedy - She nev - His eyes are beady This is my verse!
Hello!
She Look at me!
I'm dancing crazy!
You know - You're quite the charmer - My knight in armour You're the cutest of the Scoobies With your lips as red as rubies And your firm yet supple tight embrace!
- He's swell - She's sweller He'll always be my fella That's why I'll never tell her that I'm petrified I've read this tale There's wedding, then betrayal I know that come the day I'll want to run and hide I lied I said it's easy I've tried But there's these fears I can't quell Is she looking for a pot of gold?
Will I look good when I've gotten old?
Will our lives become too stressful if I'm never that successful?
When I get so worn and wrinkly that I look like David Brinkley - Am I crazy?
- Am I dreaming?
Am I marrying a demon?
We could really raise the beam in making marriage a hell So, thank God, I'll never tell I swear that I'll never tell My lips are sealed I take the Fifth Nothin' to see, move it along I'll never tell - It's a nightmare.
It's a plague.
- It's like we were being watched.
- I didn't wanna say things but they came out.
- Like a wall was missing from our apartment.
- My toes are not hairy!
- My eyes are not beady!
- You gotta stop it.
- I am looking into some leads Of course, our number is a retro pastiche that's never going to be a breakaway pop hit.
- Gimme an axe.
Show me where to point it.
- As ever, it's not quite that simple.
- But I have learned some disturbing things - ..
put that pad away I'm asking you, please no It isn't right, it isn't fair There was no parking anywhere I think that hydrant wasn't there Why can't you let it go?
- I think I've paid more than my share - Somebody set people on fire?
That's nuts!
I don't know.
One more verse of our ditty and I'd have been looking for a gas can.
Well, clearly emotions are running high.
But as far as I can tell these people burnt up from the inside, spontaneously combusted.
I've only seen the one.
I examined the body while the police were taking witness arias.
But we're sure the things are related, the singing and dancing and burning and dying.
We're not sure of much.
Buffy's looking for leads at the local demon haunts.
At least, in theory she is, but she doesn't seem to She's easing back into it.
We pulled her out of an untold Hell dimension.
Ergo the weirdness.
The important thing is to be there for her.
I'm helping her as much as I can, but, er The sun sets and she appears.
- Come to serenade me?
- So you know what's going on.
I've seen some damn funny things the last two days.
A 600-pound Chirago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you.
I remain immune, happy to say.
Drink?
A world of no.
So any idea what's causing this?
Oh.
So that's all.
You've just come to pump me for information.
What else would I wanna pump you for?
I really just said that, didn't l?
Yeah, well don't wanna bore you with the small talk.
Don't know a thing.
- What's up?
You're all bad-moody.
- It's nothing.
Glad you could stop by.
- It's nothing!
- What?
I died So many years ago But you can make me feel Like it isn't so And why you come to be with me I think I finally know Mm-mm You're scared Ashamed of what you feel And you can't tell the ones you love You know they couldn't deal Whisper in a dead man's ear It doesn't make it real That's great But I don't wanna play Cos bein' with you touches me More than I can say But since I'm only dead to you I'm saying stay away And let me rest in peace Let me rest in peace Let me get some sleep Let me take my love and bury it In a hole six foot deep I can lay my body down but I can't find my sweet release So let me rest in peace You know You got a willing slave And you just love to play the thought That you might misbehave But till you do I'm tellin' you Stop visitin' my grave And let me rest in peace I know I should go But I follow you like a man possessed There's a traitor here beneath my breast And it hurts me more than you've ever guessed If my heart could beat it would break my chest But I can see you're unimpressed So leave me be And let me rest in peace Let me get some sleep Let me take my love and bury it In a hole six foot deep I can lay my body down but I can't find my sweet release Let me rest in peace.
Why won't you Let me rest in peace?
So you're not staying then?
- Lot of homework?
- Math.
It seemed cool when we were singing about it.
Willow said they have a lead on the whole musical-extravaganza evil.
This demon that can be summoned, some sort of lord of the dance.
But not the scary one.
Just a demon.
- Do they know who summoned it?
- They don't even know its name.
But Willow will find out.
She's a brainy type.
- I'm glad you guys made up.
- What?
That fight you guys had about magic and stuff?
It gives me belly rumblings when you guys fight.
Dawn, Willow and I never fought about It's OK.
It's just You guys are so great together.
I just hate it when you But that was the only fight I've seen you guys have anyway.
But I'm still glad it's over.
Dawn, l There's something I need at the shop.
Will you be OK for a little while?
Yes.
The 15-year-old can spend half an hour alone in her locked house.
I won't be gone long.
Does anybody even notice?
Does anybody even care?
Why'd you run away?
Don't you like my style?
Why don't you come and play?
I guarantee a Great big smile I come from the imagination And I'm here strictly by your invocation So whaddaya say?
Why don't we dance awhile?
I'm the heart of swing I'm the twist and shout When you gotta sing When you gotta Let it out You call me and I come a-runnin' I turn the music on I bring the fun in Now we're partyin' That's what it's all about Cos I know What you feel, girl I know Just what you feel, girl So you're, like, a good demon?
Bringin' the fun in?
All these melodies They go on too long Then that energy Starts to come on Way too strong All those hearts laid open, that must sting Plus some customers just start combusting That's the penalty When life is but a song You brought me down and doomed this town So when we blow this scene Back we will go to my kingdom below And you will be my queen Cos I know what you feel, girl No, you see, you and me wouldn't be very regal I'll make it real, girl What I mean, I'm fifteen So this queen thing's illegal I can bring whole cities to ruin And still have time to get a soft-shoe in Well, that's great, but I'm late and I'd hate to delay her Something's cookin', I'm at the griddle I bought Nero his very first fiddle She'll get pissed if I'm missed See, my sister's the Slayer - The Slayer?
- Yuh-huh.
Find her.
Tell her tell her everything.
Just get her here.
I wanna see the Slayer burn.
Now we're partyin' That's what it's all about Good.
Good.
I feel like I should bow, or have honour, or something.
It may seem hokey but we need precision and concentration as much as power.
- We're not sure what we're facing.
- Oh, you'll figure it out.
I'm worried this session's gonna turn into some training montage from an'80s movie.
Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords, we'll just lie down until they go away.
Anyway, I don't think we need to work that much on your strength.
Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
Oh.
I thought you took care of that.
- Right.
- What would I do without you?
OK.
I'm ready.
You're not ready for the world outside You keep pretending, but you just can't hide I know I said that I'd be standing by your side But l Your path's unbeaten and it's all uphill And you can meet it, but you never will And I'm the reason that you're standing still But l I wish I could say the right words To lead you through this land Wish I could play the father And take you by the hand Wish I could stay here But now I understand I'm standing In the way The cries around you, you don't hear at all Cos you know I'm here to take that call So you just lie there when you should be standing tall But l I wish I could lay your arms down And let you rest at last Wish I could slay your demons But now that time has passed Wish I could stay here Your stalwart, standing fast But I'm standing In the way I'm just standing In the way Did you just say something?
I'm under your spell God, how can this be?
Playing with my memory You know I've been through hell Willow, don't you see?
There'll be nothing left of me You made me - Believe - Believe me, I don't wanna go And it'll grieve me cos I love you so But we both know - Wish I could say the right words - Wish I could trust that it was - To lead you through this land - Just this once, but I must do - Wish I could play the father - What I must.
I can't adjust to this - And take you by the hand - Disgust, we're done and I just Wish I could stay Wish I could stay Wish I could stay Wish I could Stay Lookie lookie what I found.
- Is this the demon guy?
- Tara!
Works for him.
Has a nice little story for the Slayer, don't you?
Come on, then.
Sing.
My master has the Slayer's sister at the Bronze because she summoned him.
At midnight he's going to take her to the underworld to be his queen.
What does he want?
Her.
If that's all you've got to say, then I'm Strong.
Someday he'll be a real boy.
So, Dawn's in trouble.
- Must be Tuesday.
- I just left her for a few minutes.
It's not your fault.
So what's the plan?
- Plan, schman.
Let's mount up.
- No.
Dawn had the wrong idea in summoning this creature, but I've seen some of these underworld child-bride deals and they never end well.
- Well, maybe once.
- We're not just gonna stay here?
Yes, we are.
Buffy's going alone.
- Don't be a stupid git.
There is no - If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll I'll never want your opinion.
- A little confusion spell could - No!
I mean, I don't think it'll help.
Forget them, Slayer.
I got your back.
I thought you wanted me to stay away from you.
Isn't that what you sang?
Spike sing a wittle song?
- Was it a pop hit or more of a book number?
- Let it go, sweetie.
Fine.
I hope you dance till you burn.
You and the little bit.
You're really not coming?
It's up to you, Buffy.
- What do you expect me to do?
- Your best.
I touch the fire And it freezes me I look into it and it's black Why can't I feel?
My skin should crack and peel I want the fire back Now through the smoke, she calls to me To make my way across the flame To save the day Or maybe melt away I guess it's all the same So I will walk through the fire Cos where else can I turn?
I will walk through the fire And let it The torch I bear is scorchin' me And Buffy's laughin', I've no doubt I hope she fries I'm free if that bitch dies!
I'd better help her out Cos she is drawn to the fire - Some people never learn - She will never learn And she will walk through the fire And let it Will this do a thing to change her?
Am I leaving Dawn in danger?
Is my slayer too far gone to care?
What if Buffy can't defeat it?
Beady-Eyes is right, we're needed!
Or we could just sit around and glare We'll see it through It's what we're always here to do So we will walk through the fire So one by one, they turn from me - I guess my friends can't face the cold - What can't we face - Why I froze, not one among them knows - If we're together?
And never can be told - She came from the grave much graver - So one by one - First he'll kill her, then I'll save her - They come to me - Everything is turning out so dark - The distant redness as their guide - No, I'll save her, then I'll kill her - That single flame - I think this line's mostly filler - Ain't what they had in mind - What's it going to take to strike a spark?
- It's what they have inside - These endless days are ending in a blaze - She will come - And we are caught in the fire - To me!
The point of no return So we will walk through the fire And let it Burn Let it burn Let it burn Let it burn!
Showtime.
- I love a good entrance.
- How are you with death scenes?
You got a name?
I've got a hundred.
I ought to know, if you're gonna be my brother-in-law.
Buffy, I swear I didn't do it.
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.
- I am.
- What?
Deal's this.
I can't kill you, you take me to Hellsville in her place.
- What if I kill you?
- Trust me.
Won't help.
- That's gloomy.
- That's life.
Come, now, is that really what you feel?
Isn't life a miraculous thing?
I think you already know.
Life's a show And we all play our parts And when the music starts We open up our hearts It's all right if some things come out wrong We'll sing a happy song And you can sing along Where there's life there's hope Every day's a gift Wishes can come true Whistle while you work So hard, all day To be like other girls To fit in in this glittering world Don't give me songs - She needs backup.
Anya, Tara.
- Don't give me songs - Give me something to sing about - Ahh-ahh-ahh - I need something to sing about - Ahh-ahh-ahh Life's a song you don't get to rehearse And every single verse Can make it that much worse Still my friends don't know why I ignore The million things or more I should be dancing for All the joy life sends Family and friends All the twists and bends Knowing that it ends Well that depends On if they let you go On if they know enough to know That when you've bowed You leave the crowd There was no pain No fear, no doubt Till they pulled me out Of Heaven So that's my refrain I live in Hell Cos I've been expelled From Heaven I think I was in Heaven So give me something to sing about Please give me something Life's not a song Life isn't bliss Life is just this It's living You'll get along The pain that you feel You only can heal By living You have to go on living So one of us is living The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
Now that was a show-stopping number.
Not quite the fireworks that I was looking for Get out of here.
Mm, I smell power.
I guess the little missus and l should be on our way.
That's never gonna happen.
I don't make the rules.
She summoned me.
I so did not.
He keeps saying that.
You have my talisman on, sweet thing.
Oh, but, no, l This at the Magic Box, on the floor.
I was cleaning, and l forgot - But I didn't summon anything.
- Well, now, that's a twist.
If it was in the shop then one of us probably - Xander?
!
- Well, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
I just thought there were gonna be dances and songs.
I just wanted to make sure we'd work out.
Get a happy ending.
I think everything worked out just fine.
Does this mean that I have to be your queen?
It's tempting.
But I think we'll waive that clause just this once.
Big smiles, everyone!
You beat the bad guy.
What a lot of fun You guys have been real swell And there's not a one Who can say this Ended well All those secrets you've been concealing Say you're happy now Once more, with feeling Now I gotta run See you all In Hell!
Where do we go From here?
Where do we go From here?
The battle's done and we kind of won So we sound our victory cheer Where do we go From here?
Why is the path Unclear?
When we know home Is near?
Understand we'll go hand in hand But we'll walk alone in fear Tell me Where do we go From here?
When does "The End" Appear?
- Bugger this.
- When do the trumpets cheer?
The curtains close on a kiss, God knows We can tell the end is near - Hey.
You should go back inside.
Finish the big group sing.
Get your kum ba ya-yas out.
I don't want to.
The day you suss out what you do want, there'll probably be a parade.
- Spike - Look, you don't have to say anything.
I touch the fire and it freezes me - I died so many years ago - I look into it and it's black - This isn't real, but I just want to feel - But you can make me feel Where do we go from here?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - We're getting married.
- Did you know?
He couldn't imagine his life without me.
Then he gave me this.
Ante up.
You play for kittens?
!
Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
I thought you took care of that.
- Right.
- What would I do without you?
You are using too much magic.
What do you want me to do?
Keep my mouth shut?
That'd be a start.
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Forget.
But I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there.
Pulled out by my friends.
Can we talk?
Vocal-cord-wise?
Yes.
With each other?
No.
We have to talk.
About what?
We kissed, Buffy.
So?
We We kissed, you and me.
All Gone With The Wind, with the rising music, and the rising music.
- And what was that?
- A spell?
Don't get all prim and proper on me.
I know what kind of girl you really are.
Don't l?
What we did is done.
But I will never kiss you, Spike, never touch you, ever, ever again.
Now, easy, boys.
No need to get physical, like.
Is there, Mr Spike?
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.
What do you want?
Me?
There are a lot of things I would like, Mr Spike.
A house in Bel Air with a generously sized swimming pool.
And, of course, the 40 Siamese that you owe me.
- Take it easy.
You'll get your kittens.
- Oh, I trust you, Mr Spike.
Oh, God!
What is it with you guys?
Why kittens?
Why can't you just use money like everybody else?
- She's funny.
I like "funny" in a girl.
- I just need a little more time.
Time, time!
Time is what turns kittens into cats.
Look, I don't wanna see anyone get hurt.
Boys.
Then you better close your eyes.
I said she was the Slayer, boss.
Ah, good for you.
The Vampire Slayer!
Have you ever given any thought to freelance work?
A little debt collecting, perhaps?
- No, thank you.
- Boss, he's gone.
- Huh?
- Spike has split.
Well, that's what I get for socialising.
All right, come on, boys.
We'll locate Mr Spike and talk to him a little more.
Oh.
It was a genuine pleasure.
If I were to stop saving his life, it would simple things up so much.
Do you think she walked around on clouds wearing Birkenstocks and played a harp?
Cos those are just not flattering.
You know, the clonky sandals.
Not a harp.
Who doesn't look good with a harp?
What?
I'm just saying what everyone's thinking.
Right, baby?
You are attractive with many good qualities.
It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy.
But it could have been one of a zillion heavenly dimensions.
All we know is that it was a good place and she was happy there.
We took her away from that.
We wrecked it for her.
We didn't wreck.
We didn't know.
We didn't wanna know.
We were so selfish.
I was so selfish.
Maybe we were.
I just feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead.
It's too mind-boggling.
So I've decided to simplify the whole thing.
Me like Buffy.
Buffy's alive.
So me glad.
Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad, but we must stop obsessing about what we did and start trying to make things better for Buffy.
I'm with Miss Psycho Pep Squad.
We need to spend more time with her.
Just hang out.
Maybe have weekly dinners over here.
Or a book club.
Short books.
Videos.
I can fix it.
I know a spell.
No!
No more spells.
Then what?
This isn't something that's gonna be fixed by a video club.
- I know I messed up, OK?
And I wanna fix it.
- I can't believe we're talking about this again.
You know how powerful magic is, how dangerous.
You could hurt someone.
You could hurt yourself.
But I know a spell that will make her forget she was ever in Heaven.
What is wrong with you?
!
I'm gonna go get that phone you probably don't hear.
High-pitched ring.
Ears like a dog.
I'm gonna help you with that.
Do you think I'm stupid?
I know you used that spell on me.
- Tara, I'm sorry.
I - Don't!
Just don't.
- There's nothing you can say.
- Tara, I didn't mean to To what?
Violate my mind like that?
How could you, Willow?
How could you, after what Glory did to me?
Violate you?
I didn't mean anything like that.
I just wanted us not to fight any more.
- I love you.
- If you don't wanna fight, you don't fight.
You don't use magic to make a fight disappear.
But I just wanted to make things better.
Better for us.
But you don't get to decide what is better for us, Will.
We're in a relationship.
We are supposed to decide together.
OK.
I'm I realise I did it wrong.
You did it the way you're doing everything.
When things get rough, you don't even consider the options.
You just you just do a spell.
It's not good for you, Willow.
And it's not what magic is for.
But I just wanna help people.
Maybe that's how it started, but you're helping yourself now, fixing things to your liking.
Including me.
Tara, no!
I don't think this is gonna work.
Hey.
It is.
It's working.
Tara, please.
I need you, baby.
I need you.
I don't need magic.
I don't.
I Let me prove it to you, OK?
I will go a month without doing any magic.
I won't do a single spell.
I swear.
Go a week, one week without magic.
Fine.
Fine.
That's easy.
Go a week, and then we'll see.
I don't know, I just think we both need some - I don't know - space?
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
I have to.
Uh-huh.
You have to be strong.
I'm trying to Trying to what?
Desert me?
Abandon me?
Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?
- I don't want to leave.
- So don't.
Please, don't.
- I can't do this without you.
- You can.
That's why I'm going.
As long as I stay, you'll always turn to me if there's something you feel you can't handle.
And I'll step in because because I can't bear to see you suffer.
Me, too.
Hate suffering.
Had about as much of it as I can take.
Believe me, I'm loath to cause you more, but this I taught you all I can about being the Slayer, and your mother taught you about life.
You You're not gonna trust that until you're forced to stand alone.
But why now?
Now that you know where I've been?
What I'm going through?
Now more than ever.
The temptation to give up will be overwhelming.
I can't let So I won't.
No giving up.
You can be here and I can still be strong.
Buffy, I've thought this over and over.
I believe it's the right thing to do.
You're wrong.
Willow, come on.
You ready?
Not so much.
You go ahead.
Tell Giles to hold up.
I'll be there in a sec.
Fine.
Hurry up.
You don't wanna miss the low-down on our latest featured creature.
For Buffy and Tara, this I char.
Let Lethe's Bramble do its chore.
Purge their minds of memories grim of pains from recent slights and sins.
When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast.
Tabula rasa.
Tabula rasa.
Tabula rasa.
- So what have we got?
- Sorry?
What kind of oogly-booglies?
Lizardy types or zombies or vampires, or what?
There are no oogley-boogleys, Dawn.
Thanks for the jacket.
It's cold out there.
Not a problem.
The cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like.
I'm glad you're here.
Erm I have something to tell you all.
I know it feels like we've been through this before Why don't you just jump to the chase?
Tell them that you're - Spike?
- Holy moly!
- You need to give me asylum.
- I'll say.
No need to get cute.
It's a disguise.
Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now.
You met him.
Toothy bloke with baby-seal breath.
Nasty fellow.
Ugly, too.
A mouthful of choppers waiting to be yanked out and worn as necklaces.
Well, now we've recovered from Spike's sartorial humour, I'll jump to the chase.
Erm I'm headed back to England.
And I plan to stay.
Indefinitely.
Now?
Not now.
I mean, not after everything.
- Yes, now.
- For real this time?
Cos honest to Pete, a shopkeeper's heart can only take so much.
Not that I want you to go.
I can't do this.
I just I need to Buffy, listen.
I know this must be awful for you.
And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry for "I'm sorry".
Everybody's sorry.
I know that you guys are just trying to help, but it's too much.
And I can't take it any more.
If you guys If you guys understood how it felt.
How it feels.
It's like I'm dying.
It Huh?
Hey.
Hey?
Hello?
Who are you people?
- Don't worry.
- Please don't hurt me.
It's OK.
I don't know anyone here either.
Yeah?
Who are you?
I uh OK.
Who are you freaks?
- You don't know me?
- Not a clue.
But you were just all, like, "Oh, hey".
Cos I thought you were a girl and I'd remember, but I am a girl.
I'm not sure who I am exactly, but OK.
Why was I on the ground?
And why are you all staring at me?
- Is this some psych test?
Am I getting paid?
- It's not just you.
Does anyone remember anything?
No.
Well, maybe we all got terribly drunk, and this is some sort of blackout.
- I don't think I drink.
- I don't see any booze.
I don't feel any head bumps.
- I don't see Allen Funt.
- Who?
OK.
I'm not panicking.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Stop looking at me like I'm panicking.
Hey, hey.
Take it easy, guy.
OK.
No one's hurt, right?
And none of us look all hatchety-murdery, so we're probably safe here.
Wherever "here" is.
Look at this stuff on these shelves.
Weird jars of weird stuff.
Weird books with weird covers, like Magic for Beginners.
Oh!
This is a magic shop.
A real magic shop.
Maybe that's it.
Maybe something magic happened.
Magic?
Magic's all balderdash and chicanery.
I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing.
Except I seem to be British, don't l?
And a man.
With glasses.
Well, that narrows it down considerably.
- I don't like this.
- Don't worry.
We'll take care of each other.
We'll get our memory back.
It'll all be right as rain.
Oh, listen to Mary Poppins!
He's got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent.
You Englishmen are always so Bloody hell.
Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks.
- Oh, God.
I'm English.
- Welcome to the nancy tribe.
You don't suppose you and l - We're not related, are we?
- There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
And you do inspire a well, a particular feeling of familiarity and disappointment.
- Older brother?
- Father.
- Oh God, how I must hate you.
- What did I do?
There's always something.
What's with the trollop?
- Hey!
- Her?
- I saw you.
Sleeping together.
- Resting together.
Look!
It's OK.
We're engaged.
Oh.
- It's a lovely ring.
- Great.
- A tarty stepmom, half old Daddy's age.
- Tarty?
Old?
You little twerp.
I'm young enough to still get carded.
Carded!
Driver's licences.
It's me.
"Alexander Harris".
Cute picture.
Hey, I exist.
I'm Willow Rosenberg.
Willow.
Funny name.
- I think it's pretty.
- What d'you got?
Tara.
And look, I'm a student at UC Sunnydale.
Me, too.
Hey, maybe we're study buddies.
I don't have a wallet.
Don't worry.
Me neither.
But here, look.
- You're Dawn.
- Or Umad.
I'm called Rupert Giles.
- Rupert.
- Rupert!
You're not too old to put across my knee, you know, sonny.
Anyway, what did I call you?
"Made with care for Randy".
Randy Giles?
Why not just call me "Horny" Giles, or "Desperate for a shag" Giles?
- I knew there was a reason I hated you.
- Randy's a family name, undoubtedly.
Ooh!
Hey, I have a name on my jacket.
- Harris.
- Harris?
That's my last name.
Maybe I have a brother and you go out with him.
Or maybe you go out with me.
We did wake up all snuggly-wuggly.
Maybe you're my boyfriend.
Either that, or I got one pissed-off brother.
I'm Anya!
This key fits this lock.
And the forms next to the cash register say that Rupert and Anya own the shop together.
This is our magic shop?
That's very progressive of me.
- So you don't have a name?
- Of course I do.
- I just don't happen to know it.
- You want me to name you?
That's sweet, but I think I can name myself.
I'll name me Joan.
Ugh!
What?
Did you just "ugh" my name?
No!
I just I mean, it's so blah.
Joan?
I like it.
I feel like a Joan.
Fine.
That's your purgative.
- Prerogative.
- Whatever, Joan.
Whatever, Umad.
- Boy, you're a pain in the - Boy, you're bossy.
- Do you think we're?
- Sisters?
You never showed me affection like that.
- I'd wager.
- We need to figure out what's going on.
- We need to get help.
- Looks like Joan fancies herself the boss.
- We have a kid here - A teenager.
A teenager.
And we have no idea what's wrong with us.
A hospital's our best bet.
Yes.
Let's Let's head out.
Any suggestions on how to get there?
Dad can drive.
He's bound to have some classic midlife-crisis transport.
Something red, shiny, shaped like a penis.
- Did you guys see that?
- Vampires!
- Maybe it's Halloween.
- Doesn't feel like it.
Even if it is, those guys are not kids, and those are definitely not costumes.
- Randy's right.
We have vampires.
- Slayer!
- They're definitely not knocking for candy.
- We need to check for other doors, make sure they're locked, then put large objects in front of'em.
Monsters are real.
Did we know this?
I don't know.
But we need our memories back.
We have to get to a hospital.
As proprietor of a magic shop, I propose we fight them.
We can use things in the shop.
Magic tricks, or whatever they're called.
- Send out Spike!
- They seem to want spikes.
- Oh!
- Here.
Let's give'em these.
- Well done.
- What are they going to do with them?
- Slayer, come out and play!
"Slay her".
That's just what they said before.
- They're gonna use the spikes to - To slay someone?
A female someone.
- Who do those jerks think they are?
- Bloodsuckers.
They kill by sucking blood.
You guys.
There's a trap door.
It seems to lead to the sewer.
Let's go!
I'm not sure what I am, so bear with me.
"Now I lay me down to sleep" Shema Yisrael Om Om - You owe us.
- Fine.
Take your damn spikes.
- Don't be stupid.
- Get your hands off me, you son of a - I said, you owe us.
- Who?
Me?
- You've got the boss's kittens.
- Kittens?
Hey!
Stay away from Randy.
- Whoa!
- What did you just do?
I don't know.
But it was cool.
The boss ain't gonna like this!
I'll be back.
And I won't be alone!
I think I know why Joan's the boss.
I'm like a superhero or something.
The boys wanna taste blood, boss.
They wanna break down the door.
The boys are barbarians.
There's no need to do that.
The humans will turn on him soon enough.
If they don't, we'll burn the place to the ground.
- OK.
I've got a plan.
- I'm all ears.
They seem to want Randy.
And I seem to be pretty strong wicked strong.
So, you go via the sewers to the hospital.
Randy and I'll give the monsters a fight.
- That's your plan?
- Yes.
Right.
I'm not leaving the shop.
I have to protect the cash register and do some spells.
Oh.
Well, magic might help.
It's worth a shot.
All right.
You work on that, then.
We need to go.
Ready, Randy?
- Ready, Joan.
- Son?
Come here.
Please.
- Right.
- Good, then.
- Randy!
- Hey!
I'm a superhero, too!
- Joan, where are you going?
Hey!
Joan, wait up!
Almost there.
C'mon.
There we go.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
This must be nice for us.
Sorry?
I mean, I know there's the vampire problem, and our memory loss, and all that.
But still, to spend this time together alone must be nice.
Yes, yes.
I'm I'm sure that's right.
Erm which book shall we start with?
- This is the book for us.
- Good.
Does it focus on mind control or memory loss?
Not exactly.
I just My intuition tells me this is the book.
I figure, being a magic-shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition.
That's fine.
But as you recall, l, too, am a magic-shop owner.
True.
But my intuition says that you're not so much the magic guy and more of a paperwork type.
OK.
Here we go.
- You don't even know - "Bara bara himble gemination".
Wait up!
Bloody hell!
What are you doing?
You don't know who you are.
- Right.
None of us do.
We're being chased - You're a vampire.
How can you say?
- l?
Me?
A vampire?
No.
- Check the lumpies.
And the teeth.
- I kill your kind.
- And I bite yours.
So how come I don't wanna bite you?
And why am I fightin' other vampires?
I must be a noble vampire, a good guy, on a mission of redemption.
I help the helpless.
I'm a vampire with a soul.
A vampire with a soul?
Oh, my God!
How lame is that?
- Perhaps we should try another book.
- No.
This book made the little fluffers.
This book's gonna send'em back.
I've got it this time, OK?
"Himble abri.
Abri voyon".
Yes, dear.
I'm a hero, really.
I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot in life, and then to rise above it.
To seek out better, nobler things.
It's inspirational.
And the two of us, natural enemies, thrown together to fight the forces of darkness.
Utter trust.
No thought of me biting you.
No thought of you staking me.
- Depends on how long you keep on yapping.
Come on.
This way.
Up the ladder.
He's coming.
Clearly that is not a helpful book, darling.
Come down and we will fix this in a sensible fashion!
Sensible?
Is it sensible for me to go down into that pit of cotton-top hell and let them hippity-hop over my flesh?
Fine.
Then stay there and keep making bunnies!
That's a capital plan!
What capital?
I never know what you're talking about.
Loo, shag, brolly - what is all that?
There's no way that you could remember me saying those words.
Bugger off, you brolly!
Note to self: learn to duck.
Get a different book!
Put that book down, do you hear?
Not that book!
How you doing, Dawn?
I'm OK.
It's scary.
But, weirdly, kind of familiar.
I know what you mean.
How are you?
A little confused.
I mean, I'm all sweaty, and trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe from a vampire.
And I think I'm kinda gay.
Look what you've done, you lunatic woman!
Don't blame me, you snobby, snotty, thinks-he's-so-great kinda jerk.
I feel compelled to take some vengeance on you.
Ow!
No wonder I'm leaving you.
What?
Look.
A one-way ticket to London and out of this engagement.
Of all the nerve.
Now look at what you've done.
That thing is gonna eat my ring.
I smell fear.
And it smells good.
"Fatas venga mata waray"!
Oh.
That's better.
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm so sorry, dear.
No.
Rupy, I'm sorry.
You were right.
That was the wrong book.
Oh.
Erm er Yes, it was.
But I'm still sorry.
Don't leave me.
Oh, Anya.
Hey, big guy.
Check out this throbbing jugular.
Alex!
Don't mess with Joan the V Buffy!
Buffy!
Sorry.
I just got back the memory of seeing King Ralph.
We should get back.
- This place certainly needs a good tidying.
- Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
From dust to dust.
You're an odd duck, Mr Spike.
Fighting your own kind.
Palling around with a slayer.
And ho-ho, that suit!
"Chutzpah" must be your middle name.
Hey, look, about our little debt problem.
It's OK.
I don't need the kittens.
You'll get paid.
I'm no welsher.
Right.
Sure.
You're good for it.
I know that.
I'm just going to Yeah.
You all right?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": You wanna fry a witch?
I'll give you a witch.
Before thee, let the unclean thing crawl!
She's a perfectly normal girl.
Then she's a rat.
We should get her one of those wheel thingies.
- Can we not do this now?
- Forget it ever happened.
Forget.
What is wrong with you?
!
I know you used that spell on me.
I will go a month without doing any magic.
- Go a week.
- Fine.
That's easy.
When the fire goes out, and the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast.
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- I'm placing an order.
- I'm not making any more girls.
Sure you are.
And here's your specs.
So you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
- OK.
- OK.
The Trio versus the Slayer.
- We're, like, super villains.
- I can't do this without you.
- You can.
That's why I'm going.
I'm headed back to England.
And I plan to stay.
We have to talk.
- About what?
- We kissed, Buffy.
- I'm sure we can work somethin' out.
- A deal of some sort.
Anything you want.
I always wanted a pony.
Oh.
You weren't really speaking to me, were you?
My bad.
Well, as long as I'm here - Argh!
Lady!
- Wow.
A mugging.
Haven't gotten one of those in a while.
Usually it's blood, and with the horror Just a good old-fashioned mugging.
Kinda sweet, actually.
Well, probably not for you.
Here.
Go.
Now.
Not too sweet for you either, huh?
Come on, rush me.
It'll be funny.
- Yaah!
- No!
Ow!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Thought they were demons.
Way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
- Remind me not to help you.
- More often?
Hey.
A little sympathy for the man with the migraine, can we?
- That's what you get for attacking a human.
- Yeah.
You'd think if the government put a chip in my head, I could at least attack criminals.
Yes, because muggers deserve to be eaten.
Just have to get your rocks off fightin' demons.
There are other ways.
And to that, an extreme "see you later".
Buffy.
Spike, it's late, OK.
Can we just finish this another time?
So you wanna jump right to the kissing, then, eh?
- I am not kissing you, Spike.
Once was - Twice.
But not again.
You're a tease, you know that, Slayer?
Get a fella's motor revvin', let the tension marinate a couple of days, then - bam!
- crown yourself the ice queen.
Need a few more metaphors for that little mix?
It's only a matter of time before you realise I'm the only one here for you, pet.
You got no one else!
What's the matter, Amy?
You lonely?
We need to get you a nice companion rat that you can love play with and grow attached to, until one day they leave you for no good reason.
Won't that be fun?
Relax, Amy.
I'm just kiddin'.
I swear, if I could figure out how to turn you back Any way Revele!
Ciò che fu, non è più.
Ciò che fu fatto, disfa.
Passato è il pericolo, finita è la prova.
Metti le cose a posto.
Aargh!
- Dude, what are you doing?
- We're not breakin' into Langley here.
You never know what new stuff they have.
Better safe than The security system here is a guy named Rusty.
- Now get up.
- Whoa, head rush.
Cool!
Guys, come on.
Quit jerkin' around.
See, that's cool.
How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?
I'm allergic to methane and you're afraid of hot things.
Besides, the tank kept makin' both of us tip over, remember?
- Got it.
- It's beautiful.
Boys, congratulations.
Phase one of the plan is now complete.
Let's get the hell outta here.
What are you boys doing?
We're with a tour group.
The "Get The Freeze Ray" tour group.
Must've gotten separated.
Museum closed five hours ago.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Guess we just lost track of time.
We should probably get the freeze ray outta here now.
Cos we love the learning, Rusty.
Museums, libraries, Disney Hall of Presidents not boring.
But more to the point, goodbye.
Dude, that is so cool!
The freeze ray totally worked.
Yeah Uh, not exactly.
There's a kink or two.
It's just a prototype.
Hey, that's really neato and stuff, but in the meantime, you know ow!
Be a bigger wuss.
Can we just go back to the lair?
Because I can't really feel my fingers.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
- Is he gonna, like?
- Oh, he'll be fine.
He'll defrost in a couple of days.
No harm, no foul.
- Won't he tell on us?
- And say what?
"Two guys and a mime took me out with their freeze ray"?
It's likely.
Come on.
Hey.
Here's some hot chocolate.
You want?
No, thanks.
Still kinda queasy.
OK.
Maybe later.
Hey.
No, it's OK.
It's it's just a siren.
It's it's all right.
OK?
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Just you know.
Everything feels weird.
I mean, it's like I felt like I was in that cage for weeks.
But it can still be OK right?
I can still get into the swing of things.
Like prom's coming up.
I was so hoping Larry would ask me.
We would make such a splash at Oh.
Oh, God.
He hasn't asked someone else, has he?
Amy three things we have to talk about.
One, Larry's gay.
Two, Larry's dead.
And three, high school's kinda over.
How long was I in the cage?
How long?
!
Willow?
Hey.
How you doin'?
Oh.
Um OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Not parades and cotton candy, but OK.
Will, um can I talk to you about something?
- Of course.
- Right.
OK.
Um You know how we all make choices?
And sometimes they're good, and sometimes they're less good.
Uh-huh.
Well, lately, l, um Oh, Tara, hey Amy?
The whole school?
By a giant snake thing.
OK, still adjusting.
Hey, Buffy.
Hi.
- How've you been?
- Rat.
You?
- Dead.
- Oh.
- Well, I should let you guys catch up.
I can - No, no, no, stay.
Do you have any cookies?
- Yeah.
What kind?
- Any kind.
Not cheese.
- Sure, in the kitchen.
I'll just get'em.
- No, I'll grab'em.
OK, well, at least, you know, let me make up the couch for you.
It's late, you should stay here.
Everybody does.
Thank you.
- Wow.
- I know.
Is she gonna be OK?
Don't know.
She's kinda freaked out.
But then I would be too.
Wow.
Yeah, I just realised I could.
Thought of the right thing, and It's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around.
So, what were you gonna tell me?
You were sounding all serious.
Huh?
Oh.
It's nothing.
I mean, the whole Amy, rat, Amy thing No way I'm toppin' that.
Hey.
How you doin'?
Need anything?
No, thanks.
Good cookies.
- Sorry about your mom.
- Thanks.
- It's crazy, all the things that've happened.
- No kidding.
Snyder got eaten by a snake.
High school got destroyed Oh, Gatorade has a new flavour.
Blue.
See?
Head spinning.
People getting frozen.
Willow's dating girls.
And did you hear about Tom and Nicole?
People getting frozen?
..
in critical yet stable condition, as authorities continue their investigation into the robbery that left one man frozen solid.
Live from the museum, Bryan Morris, KOUS.
Weird.
Excuse me.
Great.
Well, well.
Look who decided to show up.
What are you doing here, Spike?
Well, you know a man was frozen alive in there?
A little compassion, love.
As long as we're both here, you might as well tag along.
As a team, we could - Yeah, that never really ends well, does it?
- It did the other night.
You really seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike.
And you seem awfully quick to forget about'em.
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm sorry if you thought that it meant more.
But?
But when I kissed you you know I was thinking about Giles, right?
I always wondered about you two.
What?
Oh, gross, Spike!
He left.
I was depressed.
Ergo vulnerability and bad kissing decisions.
But that's all that it was.
You have to let it go.
- Did it work?
- What?
You convince yourself?
Please, stop.
A man can change.
You're not a man.
You're a thing.
- Stop walkin' away.
- Don't touch me!
Argh!
Arghh!
Ohh!
You're a thing.
An evil, disgusting thing.
Look at all the goodies.
- Aargh!
- That's right, you should scream.
Creature of the night here, yeah?
Some people forget that.
- Please.
- She thinks I'm house-broken.
- She forgot who she's dealing with.
- Anything Just cos she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be too?
Cos I'm not.
I know what I am.
I'm dangerous.
I'm evil.
- I'm sure you're not evil.
- Yes, I am.
I am a killer.
That's what I do.
I kill.
And, yeah, maybe it's been a long time, but it's not like you forget how.
You just do it.
And now I can - again - all right?
So here goes.
- This might hurt a little.
Aargh!
What the hell is going on?
Good God, that's a lot of shake.
I mean, I know part of our big movie and milkshake fun day, but good God, that's a lot of shake.
Helps to wash down the Raisinets.
Promise me you will eat something green tonight.
Leafy green, not gummy green.
- Movie was fun.
- Yeah.
It was ironic when all those cute inner-city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
You know that I will always be there for you, right?
There was actually more of a lead-in when I practised that at home.
- I know.
- It's just I wanted you to know that my moving out had nothing to do with you, and I will never stop loving you.
I know.
- Do you think you'll ever get back together?
- I wish I knew.
- But you still love her.
- Very much.
I just Sometimes other things get in the way.
I know.
She's been doing a lot better lately, though.
She's been really good about being careful about stuff.
Well, good.
Great.
That's that's great.
Here.
Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
He's all thawed out.
It says they used hair dryers.
Huh.
Everything slowed down.
His nervous system, circulatory system - He's still unconscious.
Anya?
It's such a pain.
The text I wanted, Giles took it with him.
He has this thing that owning a book makes it, like, his property.
What should we do?
Should we call him?
It's, like, the middle of last night there.
Or maybe it's tomorrow.
Anyone remember how that works?
It's OK, no one freak.
We'll just do it another way.
I don't think we need to resort to I mean Oh.
Hey.
Cool.
Back to basics.
A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action.
That's great, Will, I haven't seen you do that in a long time.
I don't remember that part.
It's quicker.
It'll just take a sec to go through the files.
OK.
Internal police report.
A diamond was stolen from the museum last night.
A big one.
On loan from the British Museum.
They're withholding information to smoke out the criminals.
Oh It's pretty.
There's a picture.
Well, is it a supernatural diamond?
You know, like, healing powers, or good-lucky?
Maybe it's cursed.
Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
Well, we'll keep checkin', shall we?
Well, you know, I am kinda beat, and I betcha that's tiring, that thing you're doin' there - Guys, I'm fine.
What's the deal with?
- Oh, for cryin' out loud.
This is bizarre.
You're all "la la la"!
with the magic, and the not talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you, and everyone's scared to say anything to you.
Except me.
Is this that thing I do that you were commenting?
Guys, it's OK.
It's hard, but it's better this way.
Little things started taking over - things that didn't matter, but we saw them differently, so they got blown out of proportion.
And this time away will help us sort through things.
Really.
Now, let's just keep working on this.
I don't wanna leave Amy alone in the house so long.
Amy, is she?
How is she adjusting?
It's hard to say.
It's a lot to take in.
I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff.
You know, licking her hands clean, shredding newspaper, leaving little pellets in the corner.
Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
- I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
- And so big.
Yes, gentlemen, it turns out size is everything.
No offence, man.
It makes colours with the light.
All right, we've finished the first part.
Time for phase two.
Is the van fired up?
Check.
Hello!
It's called knocking!
Knock, knock, robot boy.
Need you to look at my chip.
Is that British slang or something?
Cos we're not - In my head.
The chip in my head.
- We're kind of in the middle of somethin'.
You can play holodeck another time.
Right now, I'm in charge.
What are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like playing your Wait, what are you doing?
Examine my chip, or else Mr Fett here is the first to die.
Hey, all right.
Let's not let's not do anything crazy here.
That's a limited edition, All right.
Dude chill.
You can still make it right.
You know you don't wanna do this.
What I want is answers, nimrod.
Right.
But you don't wanna hurt the Fett, cos, man, you're not comin' back from that.
You know, you don't just do that and walk away.
- That right?
Let's find out.
- Agh!
One second.
- I think that's Spike.
- Of course it is, and he's evil.
- Completely capable of removing that head.
- I'm gonna help him.
Are you sure we can trust him?
I mean, we all have heads too.
We help him, and he owes us one.
We get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy.
Maybe we can even find a way to keep her out of phase two.
- Jonathan's right.
Can we trust him?
- Course not.
But alliances aren't about trust.
See, he needs us, we need him.
That's how these things work.
- I think we're ready.
Agreed?
- Agreed.
Do what you need to do.
I think we can work somethin' out.
I'll take a look at your chip.
It'll be a deal.
We scratch your back, you scratch I'm not scratching your anything.
You do what I tell you.
That's the deal.
Deal?
- Deal.
- Then let's go.
Oh!
It's OK, it's OK.
It'll be fine.
Amy?
God, you're back.
You said you wouldn't be gone that long.
- I wasn't.
I mean, I thought it was - Let's go somewhere.
- Don't you wanna go see your dad?
- No.
I can't.
Not yet.
Too many questions.
- About where you were.
- No, about how I got there.
I wish there was a way I could make him forget the last three years.
Well, hey, I can help you with that.
Only you might wanna sew your name into your clothes first or somethin'.
I just don't wanna deal with him right now.
I think I would be bored.
- Well.
- Come on, let's get outta here.
Well, what do you wanna do?
I don't know.
Something fun.
Anything not involving a big wheel.
Or maybe you'd rather sit home all night, alone, like in high school.
No.
No.
You know what?
I can have fun.
- Heck, I deserve some fun.
- Yeah, you do.
I can party!
Not like I owe anyone anything.
I am totally free.
So let's make with the fun.
You're English, right?
Yeah.
I've seen every episode of Doctor Who.
- Not Red Dwarf, though, cos, um - Cos it's not out yet on DVD.
Right.
It's not out yet on DVD.
- Warren!
- Here I am.
Here.
Bloody hell.
Get on with it, then.
- Help me out here, Spock, I don't speak loser.
- OK.
Right.
Um Your chip works fine.
Yeah.
- There's gotta be something wrong - No, no, listen.
I don't know what that thing does.
I'd like to.
- Hey.
- But whatever it is, it works fine.
The signal still is coming through on a steady pulse - which it's supposed to.
- If you're lying to me - No!
It's all right here.
I mean, it is.
It's really not that hard to figure out, if you just What?
- You tell anyone about this - No, I promise.
Who would I tell?
- I don't even know what this is about.
- It's about the rules having changed.
Everything's different now.
Nothin' wrong with me.
Something wrong with her.
Hello!
We're home!
- Looks like no one's here.
- Well, I'm sure they'll be back soon.
I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research.
Well, then, I should probably get back.
Or you can stay and wait for them.
Then you can get a chance to catch up with everyone.
Yeah, I don't think that's such a great idea.
OK.
Your call.
I have the TV to keep me company till they get back.
You notice how it's been getting dark so much earlier these days?
Ha.
Talking cat.
Fine.
I'll stay, but just until they get back.
And only to make sure that you're not alone.
This has nothing to do with anyone else.
Sure.
Cool.
Up to you.
I know.
Xander engaged, I couldn't believe it either.
It's so weird.
So, what's she like?
Thousand-year-old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit phobia.
Well, that's so his type.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Well, let's go, then.
We're gonna go dance.
Do you wanna come?
Oh.
No.
You go.
I'll keep an eye on our drinks.
OK.
You know, because if you want something a little more your style I'm sure we can swing that.
No.
Really, no.
Hi.
Brie.
Willow.
Nice um, top.
- No.
Thanks, but no.
- Are you sure?
- I'm not She I'm still - It's cool.
Oh.
Sorry.
- So, are we gonna go?
- Yeah.
- Sure you're gonna be OK?
- Yeah.
Go.
I'm all kinds of good.
No use looking at me like that.
It's the gullet for you, mister.
Hey.
Sorry.
I kinda got caught up.
No, it's OK.
You know, if rats could dance they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
Hey, come on.
We're just gettin' started.
- I think I'll sit this one out.
- You can't just work us up like that, then - Hey!
- I think she said no.
Well, nobody asked you Ellen.
- You wanna dance?
- That's all.
Nice, slow relaxing dance.
- Gee.
- I think I do feel more relaxed.
Aha!
I got it!
Here's our villain, right here!
What?
That's a D&D manual, sweetie.
No, but it could Oh.
Face it, we're not gonna find it because it doesn't exist.
There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
Well, maybe he doesn't eat them.
You know, maybe he just thinks they're pretty.
We suck.
We need new brains.
What's up with Willow?
- Out with Amy, I guess.
- Great, someone to do more magic with.
But at least she's not all cooped up and crying.
That's forward momentum.
I don't know everything that happened with Tara, but Tara thinks Willow is doin' too much magic.
And she's not the only one.
I know.
But I think she'll be fine.
It's Willow.
She of the level head.
Those are the ones you have to watch out for the most - responsible types.
Right.
She might go crazy and start alphabetising everything.
I'm serious.
Responsible people are always so concerned with being good all the time, that when they finally get a taste of being bad, they can't get enough.
It's all kablooey.
- That's not true.
- OK, not kablooey, more like bam!
It's human nature, Buff.
Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her.
She was getting out of control with it before Tara left, and now that she's gone It's gotta be seductive.
Just giving in to it, going totally wild.
- We need to keep an eye on her.
- OK.
We'll keep an eye.
But we can't assume everybody's getting seduced.
Sometimes Magic Box.
Slayer.
Spike?
Meet me at the cemetery.
Spike?
Bloody hell.
Yes, it's me.
You're calling me on the phone?
- Just be there.
- Why?
Are you helping again?
You have a lead on this frost monster?
Something like that, yeah.
Thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
What?
!
No.
No grunting!
I was talking shop, love, but if you got other ideas - you, me, cosy little tomb with a view - So, what did Captain Peroxide want?
- Nothing.
He just, you know, wanted to see if I wanted to patrol, for the monster.
But I told him that l would not.
I'm telling you, I think there's something about this thing.
I don't know.
It seems like we've been through every book.
Even the ones that weren't so boring you wanna die.
- We have those?
- All the things that have happened lately, - the bank robbery, the jewellery heist - The exploding lint.
- Is it me, or do these things seem really - Lame?
Well, I was gonna go with unusual, but yeah.
I'll do a quick patrol tonight, and after a good night's sleep, we can solve this tomorrow.
- Optimism.
I remember optimism.
- That's because you're, like, a thousand.
- Good night, guys.
- Night.
- Slayer.
- And so my night is now complete.
- You never showed.
- Sorry.
Little busy actually doing stuff.
- You shouldn't be so flip.
- You gonna walk-behind-me to death?
I'm just sayin' things might be a little different.
You ought to be careful.
Enough.
Get outta my way.
Or what?
Oh, the pain, the pain is gone.
Guess what I just found out.
Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart.
How?
Don't you get it?
Don't you see?
You came back wrong.
It's a trick.
You did something to the chip.
It's no trick.
It's not me, it's you.
Just you, in fact - that's the funny part.
You're the one that's changed.
That's why this doesn't hurt me.
Came back a little less human than you were.
You're wrong.
Then how come you're so spooked, love?
And why can l do that?
You're wrong.
You know, this music isn't quite Poor little lost girl.
She doesn't fit in anywhere.
She's got no one to love.
Me?
I'm lost?
Look at you, you idiot!
Poor Spikey.
Can't be a human, can't be a vampire.
Where the hell do you fit in?
Your job is to kill the Slayer.
But all you can do is follow me around making moon eyes.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Admit it.
You like me because you enjoy getting beat down.
So, really, who's screwed up?
Hello!
Vampire!
I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
What's your excuse?
So we've kinda played this scene.
- Yeah.
- Return.
I just keep thinking there's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this.
Besides, it's way too early to go home yet.
- I wasn't plannin' on hurtin' you.
Much.
- You haven't even come close to hurting me.
Afraid to give me the chance?
You afraid I'm gonna?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Previously: It looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought.
- How?
- You came back wrong.
Willow, you're using too much magic.
You want me to just keep my mouth shut?
That'd be a good start.
- Forget.
- I know you used that spell on me.
What is wrong with you?
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
- Amy?
How've you been?
- Rat.
You?
- Dead.
- Oh.
It's nice having another magically inclined friend around.
There's gotta be some place, like, bigger than this.
It's way too early to go home yet.
- It's beautiful.
- Congratulations.
Phase one is complete.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Are you afraid I'm gonna What time is it?
Almost seven.
God, I just closed my eyes for a minute.
And now there's cartoons.
Plus a mother of all night-wedgies.
Uh-oh.
It's not tragic.
I'm sure as soon as I stand up No, Dawn.
Why didn't anybody wake us up?
Where is everyone?
Willow didn't come home either.
They were out all night.
- Where are they?
- I'm sure they're fine, Dawnie.
I'm sure they just lost track of time.
When When did the building fall down?
I don't know.
Must have been sometime between the first time and the, uh Oh.
Oh, my God.
- Shoe.
Need my shoe.
- What's the hurry, love?
The hurry is I left Dawn all night.
And don't call me "love".
You didn't seem to take issue with that last night.
- Or with any of the nasties we whispered.
- Can we not talk?
I don't see why you have to run off so quick.
- Thought we could - Not gonna happen.
Last night was the end of this freak show.
- Don't say that.
- What did you think was gonna happen?
What, we're gonna read the newspaper together?
Play footsie under the rubble?
Not exactly what I had in mind.
- Stop!
- Make me.
- No, no, I have to - Stay.
I'm stuck here.
Sun's up.
I knew the only thing better than killing a slayer would be f What?
!
Is that what this is about?
Doing a slayer?
I wouldn't throw stones.
You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
Shut up.
I'm just saying vampires get you hot.
A vampire got me hot.
One.
But he's gone.
You're just You're just convenient.
So, what now?
You go back to treating me like dirt till the next time you get an itch you can't scratch?
Well, forget it.
Last night changed things.
I'm done being your whipping boy.
- Nothing's changed.
It was a mistake.
- Bollocks!
It was a bloody revelation.
You can act as high and mighty as you like but I know where you live now, Slayer.
I've tasted it.
- Get a grip.
Like you're God's gift!
- Hardly.
Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?
Let me go!
I may be dirt but you're the one who likes to roll in it, Slayer.
You never had it so good as me.
Never.
- You're bent.
- Yeah, and it made you scream, didn't it?
I swear to God, if you tell anyone about last night, I will kill you.
Right.
You're gonna want these, too.
Pancakes?
Sure.
Should we call Xander?
What if they're all in a ditch somewhere?
Ditches are bad.
Mom always used to talk about the ditches.
Nobody's in a ditch.
We'll call, but we'll give them some time before we wake them up.
Funny shapes, or?
It'll wear off in a day or - Hey.
- Hey.
I just Buffy didn't come home last night either, so Hey this is Amy.
Amy, Tara.
Tara, Amy.
- How you doing?
- Fine.
I - I'd better get going.
- Amy!
Amy the rat?
- Sorry.
- No, that's fair.
I was a rat.
When?
Last night.
It's nuts.
Everything's different.
I mean the Bronze, for one thing.
Willow's a freaking amazing witch now.
I couldn't keep up with her last night.
- Amy.
- No, it's true!
I can do some transmogrify, but she is messing with dimensions.
It was awesome!
This blowhard dude?
First she made his mouth disappear.
And then I'm talking too much.
Sorry.
It's just been, you know, me and a bag of pellets for the last few years, so No, it's fine.
It's just, um I really need to go.
- Tara, you left some stuff upstairs - I'll get them later.
Tara!
Buffy!
Where were you?
Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
- You're not.
You're all sore and limpy.
I'm not sore, I just I had a fight, you know, the all-nighter kind.
Figured.
I knew that's why you didn't call.
So, what's the big bad?
Should we be worried?
No.
I mean, I think you guys are safe.
- Tara was here?
- I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
You guess?
Where were you?
We went out.
We kinda lost track of time.
I never would have if I knew you weren't coming home.
No, of course.
I mean, you know It wasn't intentional.
And, you know, everyone's safe.
- You are, right?
You're OK?
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, um I think my pancakes are burning, but Tara was making them.
I've I've gotta get some sleep.
Me too.
Yeah.
I should go home.
Dad's expecting me.
- OK.
I'll call you later.
- Yeah.
Good.
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm sorry about everything.
It's OK.
You should rest.
You're beat from monster-wrestling all night.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
I'm gonna crash, too.
Night, Dawnie.
No problem.
I'll just go find some awake people.
Claudete.
Claudete!
All these demons are starting to look alike.
You got reptiles, reptiles with horns, reptiles with gills.
And I'm still finding nothing of the Steal a Diamond, Freeze a Guy variety.
An, would you hand me that one next to you?
Great.
We're not even married yet and already you've stopped listening to me.
- Anya!
- I'm sorry, but this is pointless!
We've been researching for ever and we still don't know who robbed the museum.
What's up?
Anya has a theory.
She thinks Martha Stewart froze that guy.
Don't be ridiculous.
Martha Stewart isn't a demon.
- She's a witch.
- Please, she Really?
Yes.
Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.
Fascinating, but we have work to do.
I know I do.
I can't decide whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses, - or the traditional burlap with blood larva.
- The traditional what?
I was a demon for a thousand years.
I can't turn my back on all the ways of my people.
Can I weigh in on this me wearing larva No.
At least I'm not asking you to perform the rite of self-flagellation.
Guys, there's something out there.
There is.
And as much as I hate to admit that my bizarre bride-to-be has a point, we're getting nowhere here, Buff.
Maybe it's time to hit the streets.
Get Spike on it.
No!
No Spike.
And no hit the streets.
We stay put, you know?
Away from distractions.
We'll figure this out.
What about Willow?
Can't she do something?
Maybe.
But she's home sleeping.
Sleeping?
She sick?
No, she was out late.
With Amy.
And I'm bizarre.
At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
No, it's not like that.
She's just helping Amy through a transition.
And making herself a playmate to do magic with.
- Someone who won't monitor her like Tara.
- Willow's a grown-up.
Maybe she doesn't need to be monitored.
She's going through something, but we're not her.
Maybe she has reasons for acting this way.
And so what if she crossed a line?
We all do stuff.
Stupid stuff.
But then we learn, and we don't do it again.
So, you know, who are we to be all judgy?
Not judgy, Buff.
Just observy.
All we're saying is she's acting different.
She's not herself.
What do you wanna do?
It's gonna be hard to top last night.
I don't know if I can.
I felt awful today and I couldn't do magic.
Took me all day to get my powers back.
I think we should just take it easy.
- I have a better idea.
- What?
I know this guy, and he knows spells that last for days.
And the burnout factor is, like, nothing.
- Really?
He's a warlock?
- I guess.
I am not kidding you.
This guy will blow your mind.
He will take you to places that you can't even imagine.
Is it dangerous?
Would that stop you?
- This is it.
- Where?
You said the guy lived around here.
He does.
You can't feel it?
What do you?
- Here.
- It's hot.
Come on.
It's cool, isn't it?
The place is cloaked.
Yeah.
Moves around a lot too.
Keeps Rack out of trouble.
Rack?
Who's?
Rack!
Rack, it's my turn.
- No, you said I was up.
- I've been here for hours!
I believe these two are next.
Thanks, Rack, for taking us.
It's been a while.
You'll never believe - You were a rat.
- How did you know?
I hope that taught you not to mess with spells you can't handle.
You should leave that in the hands of a professional.
This one's giving off vibes.
I don't mean to vibe at you, if it's in a negative way.
No, no, I mean you have power, girl.
It's just coming off you in waves.
Not so much.
I mean, I can do stuff but I get tapped out quick, and I've used practically every spell I know.
What do you want me to do about that?
I don't know.
I thought - Amy said - "Amy said".
Amy said I could help you.
But did Amy say how you could help me?
- No.
I have some money, a bit - Not money.
Well, I could help you with your computer.
I'm really handy.
Just relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You gotta give a little to get a little, right?
It's OK.
It's over fast.
That's right.
I'm just gonna take a little tour.
You taste like strawberries.
Ow.
Ow, ow!
Ow.
- Or you could do it the hard way.
- Spatulas are for wimps.
I'm making peanut-butter and banana quesadillas.
You want?
No, thanks.
I'm more in water mode.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
You sure?
It's my own brand-new invention.
I'm sure.
No, my tummy's feeling kinda rumbly.
Your loss.
Very delicious.
Buffy called.
She's going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
- Oh.
Did she need help?
- No, she was just calling to check in.
For the tenth time today.
I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford cos of the other night.
Yeah.
About that, I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
Right.
Assume and make you an ass out of me.
Or something.
Anyway, please, it's cool.
It's not like I even needed Tara to stay over.
I'm so totally fine on my own.
But you are gonna be around tonight, right?
Right, totally!
We can do something if you want.
A movie, maybe?
Really?
But I thought you weren't feeling so good.
Well nothing a little Dawnie time won't fix.
If you bag the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
Thank God!
Remind me never to invent that again.
Yuck.
Great, this'll be great.
I'll grab the paper and see what's playing.
I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator.
It's the first place she goes after patrolling.
Hello?
Willow?
Dawn?
- What's going on?
- Uh-oh.
Busted.
Where's Willow?
She said She said I could wait!
- What is this?
- It's not what you think it is!
It's sage!
That is what I think it is.
What's going on?
Where's Willow and Dawn?
I I saw her, but that was I like your coat.
When does the Slayer find time to shop?
So they didn't let you in?
Not that they know of.
- What else did you take?
- Nothing.
- Ow!
- What else?
!
Please!
I need this stuff.
Willow wants me to have it.
She understands.
Understands what?
Breaking into someone's house for kitchen spices?
No, I don't think so.
You should.
She's as bad as I am.
Worse.
I bet she's at Rack's right now.
- Rack's?
- A place.
He does spells.
Heavy stuff.
- Willow's his new favourite.
- She's there?
With Dawn?
- Oh, don't shake me again, I'm gonna boot.
- Then tell me where this place is and I won't.
- It's downtown, but it moves.
- What do you mean, "it moves"?
It's downtown.
I'm not sure where it would be tonight exactly - Tell me how to find it.
- You just kinda have to feel it out Oh, God, I think I'm gonna Ugh.
So the burger was good?
You liked it?
Are you kidding?
It was like a meat party in my mouth.
OK.
Now I'm just a kid, and even I know that came out wrong.
It was good.
But you should have had something.
I will.
I'll eat.
I'm saving myself for popcorn.
The other day, you had fun?
Mm what other day?
Give me a Mon or a Fri here, something to work with.
- The other day with Tara.
- Oh.
Uh, yeah.
I mean, it was nice.
But it wasn't a laugh riot.
She's sad and everything.
- Did she say something?
- Not exactly.
I can just tell, by the way she was acting.
Oh.
Are you sure you're OK?
You look a little I'm fine.
And Tara's in her new place and everything?
She's all settled in?
We really didn't get into Is this right?
Is this the way to the movies?
Oh, yeah, I'm I just took you the long way around.
But we're almost there.
I just have to make one quick stop first.
What is this place?
Why is it hidden?
I don't know.
It's cool, isn't it?
You just hang here for a minute and I'll be back.
You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
What about the movie?
It starts at nine.
We'll make it.
I'll just be a minute.
And it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.
I like the trailers.
What do you think, strawberry?
Can you handle some more?
God, do you sleep through anything?
I was like yelling, and nothing.
I'm a bit knackered.
Had a long night.
Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, love.
- Get dressed.
Dawn's missing.
- Again?
Ever think about a LoJack for the girl?
- What's the story?
- She went out with Willow.
Willow?
That's a sorry excuse to come by.
If you want the touch all you need to do Spike.
Willow's into something.
Her and Dawn have been missing for hours.
- There's some guy named Rack.
- Rack?
- Yeah, he's some sort of - He deals in magic.
Black stuff.
Dangerous.
I've been all over and I can't find his place.
He cloaks it.
You can only feel it if you're into the big bad.
A vampire So let's go!
Oh, that's right.
Hide your blushing eyes.
Hey, wait your turn.
Hey, Dawnie.
It's movie time.
Do you know how long I've been here?
It's too late for the movie.
And that guy smells - Are you OK?
- Fine.
Let's get outta here.
So, what do you wanna do, cutie?
It's late.
I just wanna go home.
No way!
I said we were gonna have fun, and we're gonna have fun.
I'm serious.
I think we should just get out of here.
"We should just get out of here".
Come on, Dawnie, it's grown-up time.
Do you wanna play with the grown-ups or not?
Why are you acting this way?
Don't get all weird on me.
We're fine.
Everything's fine.
- Anything?
- Not yet.
I might pick up on it if you stop asking me every two seconds.
Spike, if you're dragging this out What, so I can linger near your precious self?
Get a grip.
Like you've never drawn things out before.
Maybe, but we've been through this, haven't we?
Things have changed.
Will you quit that?
The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
That's the power of your charms.
Last night was the most perverse, degrading experience of my life.
Yeah.
Me too.
That might be how you get off, but it's not my style.
No, it's your calling.
Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
Now, I admit it.
You've had me by the short hairs.
I love you.
You know it.
But I got my rocks back.
You felt something last night.
Not love.
Not yet.
But I'm in your system now.
You're gonna crave me, like I crave blood.
The next time you come calling, if you don't stop being a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
That's it!
I want you out of my life.
Out of my work, out of my home Too late for that.
You invited me in already.
And as for your work, you need me.
- Like tonight.
- I'll find Dawn myself.
You really gonna put your little sis in danger just to spite me?
Willow, I'm serious.
I'm going home.
Then go!
God, I thought we were gonna hang.
You're not coming with me?
I don't know.
Maybe I could just, uh pop you back.
With magic?
- What's that?
- What?
I didn't - I'm getting out of here.
- Aw, Dawnie, don't.
It was probably a cat or something like that.
- It's OK.
He's not real.
- Seems real.
Very real.
- You summoned me, witch.
- I didn't.
Did.
You raised hell with your magics.
Fresh!
- She has nothing to do with it.
It was me.
- Yes.
He's coming!
He's too fast.
Open.
Get in.
Close.
Drive.
What are you doing?
Whoo!
- Take that, scuzz.
Oh, God.
Dawn!
Now you're scared?
Better late than never.
- Oh, no.
- Dawn What happened?
Are you OK?
He was after Willow.
She made the car drive.
Don't!
I need to see it.
Let me see your arm.
Oh, God, there's blood.
- We need to get her to a doctor.
- Is she OK?
Is she OK?
Back off, Will.
I got her.
- No, Dawnie.
- I mean it.
Stay away from her.
Dawnie, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident!
I didn't see.
I'm so, so sorry.
Dawnie!
Dawnie, don't.
Dawnie, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Get up.
I screwed it up.
Everything.
Tara You know what?
You did screw up.
You could have killed her!
You almost did!
I know, I know.
I can't stop, Buffy!
I tried and I can't.
- You can.
- I can't.
I can't.
I ju God, I need help.
Please!
Please help me!
Please.
Please.
- Is she OK?
- She's sleeping.
The ER doc gave her something for the pain.
It knocked her out.
But she's gonna be all right?
It's a fracture.
It's gonna take some time.
God, I'm sorry.
I'm so I just don't understand.
I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack.
And I don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it.
I don't know.
The magic, I thought I had it under control, and then I didn't.
Because of Tara?
No.
It started before she left.
It's why she left.
It seemed like things were going so well.
It was.
But, I mean, if you could be the plain old Willow or super Willow, who would you be?
I guess you don't actually have an option on the whole super thing.
Will, there's nothing wrong with you.
You don't need magic to be special.
Don't l?
I mean, Buffy, who was l?
Just some girl.
- Tara didn't even know that girl.
- You are more than some girl.
And Tara wants you to stop.
She loves you.
- We don't know that.
- I know that.
I promise you.
I just It took me away from myself.
I was free.
I get that.
More than you But it's wrong.
People get hurt.
If something had happened to Dawn tonight Something worse - I know.
- No, I don't think you do.
I I was out of my mind.
I did things I can't even It won't happen again, I promise.
No more spells.
I'm finished.
Good.
I think it's right, to give it up.
No matter how good it feels.
It's not worth it.
Not if it messes with the people I love.
The magic wasn't all great.
I won't miss the nosebleeds and the headaches and stuff.
There you go.
Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra.
- Don't ask.
- Now I don't have to.
Cos it's over.
Exactly.
It's over.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Previously: Last night changed things.
The only thing different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
Is this the way to the movies?
What is this place?
I'll just be a minute.
Willow and Dawn have been missing for hours.
- Do you know how long I've been here?
- Let's get outta here.
Dawnie, I'm sorry!
- You could have killed her!
- I need help.
No more spells.
I'm finished.
- Got it.
- It's beautiful.
Phase one of the plan is now complete.
Candles?
We can't have candles?
Dawn, it's a magic clearance.
Everything must go.
But they're just candles.
Well, to you and me they're just candles, but to witches they're like bongs.
So, no candles, no charms, no - Bird.
- No bird?
The peacock on the table.
It has two crystals in it.
Tara, she she left them.
I'll make sure she gets them.
Dawn, can you grab the fertility god statue on the desk over there?
Kokopelli?
No!
I love him.
And he was Mom's.
Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like?
Dawn, I explained this to you.
Willow has a problem.
The next few weeks are gonna be crazy hard on her as it is.
Any reminder of what it is that she's trying to stay away from could cause her to give in to temptation.
And that would be bad.
OK, that's it.
It's finally done.
I mean, it still needs a trial run, but it's - Kinda clunky-lookin'.
- What?
I pictured something cooler.
More ILM, less Ed Wood.
You wanna see cool?
I'll show you cool.
Mama!
Did it?
Is it?
Yeah.
- I'd call that a successful test.
- Well, that's just half the test.
Hey Hey!
- You penis!
- Oh, cheer up, Frodo.
Because, thanks to my brains and our mystical gem, we got an invisibility ray.
And I'd say that makes us pretty much unstoppable.
Dawn, come on.
You gotta eat breakfast.
Xander's gonna be here any second.
She's gonna be late for school again.
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK.
Not "ready to head back to classes, face the world" OK, but the shakiness is only semi now.
I thought I'd spend the day fishing the Net for more poop on the stolen diamond.
I called you before.
Didn't hear you.
Hey, Dawnie, I'm making you a nice omelette.
Not hungry.
Dawn, you need to eat something.
Thanks for your concern.
OK, I deserve the wrath of Dawn, but why is she taking it out on you?
Because I let it happen.
- Buffy, I was the one who - Who was drowning.
My best friend.
I was too wrapped up in my own dumb life to even notice.
Morning.
What are you doing?
And here?
Just took a stroll.
Found myself in your neck of the woods.
Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
Well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing.
Thought I might've dropped it here.
Haven't seen it.
I'm gonna head back to my room, get dressed.
Oh, l - Lame.
- What?
You.
Making up excuses.
Oh, don't flatter yourself, love.
Bloody fond of that lighter.
Stop trying to see me.
And stop calling me that.
So, um what should I call you then?
Pet?
Sweetheart?
My little Goldilocks?
You know, I love this hair.
The way it bounces around when Uh-uh-uh!
This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.
What the hell is that supposed to?
Stop that.
Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!
Still trying to mack on Buffy?
Wake up already.
Never gonna happen!
Only a complete loser would hook up with you.
Unless she's a simpleton like Harmony, or a nut sack like Drusilla Hey!
You really need to get Dawn off to school.
Let's go fetch her, OK?
You can let yourself out, right, Spike?
- Dawn!
Xander's here!
- I'm here.
You have everything?
And after school, you - Yeah, yeah.
Let's go, Xander.
- You will come straight home?
Sure.
Maybe we can find some time for you to get me into another car accident.
- Oh, good morning.
You must be Dawn.
- May I help you?
I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services.
We had an appointment?
- Oh, for Wednesday.
- This is Wednesday.
Right.
Well, Dawn, you better - And, Xander, you'll drive safely?
- Yes, ma'am.
Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?
Yeah, well, it's been one of those mornings, you know?
Hey, come on in.
Sorry about the mess.
We're doing a little house-clean.
So, we gonna chat this out, or what?
Now's really not a good time.
I have company.
No worries.
I'll wait.
Um, Ms Summers, if you and your boyfriend would like He's not Not my boyfriend.
He's just a Spike, this nice woman is from Social Services.
Oh, right.
Hey, Buffy's a great mom.
She takes good care of her little sis.
Like, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.
- I'm sorry, did you say - Crib.
Crib.
He said crib.
You know kids today and their buggin' street slang.
Spike, didn't you have to go now, you know, because of that thing?
Thing, yeah.
My blanket.
He sleeps here?
What?
No!
No.
Oh, the blanket That's it's a security thing.
He has issues.
Nope, just me and Dawn living here.
Buffy, I'm not feeling hot, so I'm gonna take a quick nap, OK?
OK, Will!
That's Willow.
She kinda lives here too, actually.
Oh, so you live with another woman?
Oh Oh, it's not a gay thing, you know.
Well, she's gay, but we don't gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with You know, I know what that looks like, but I swear it's not what it looks like.
It's magic weed.
It's not mine.
I think I've seen enough.
No, actually, I really don't think that you have.
It's just it's been kind of a bad time.
It's been a bad time now for a while, hasn't it, Ms Summers?
Your sister's grades have fallen sharply in the last year, due in large part to her frequent absences and lateness.
- But there are good reasons.
- Oh, I'm sure there are.
But my interest is in Dawn's welfare and the stability of her home life - something I'm just not convinced that an unemployed young woman can provide.
I can.
I do.
Well, we'll just have to see about that then, won't we?
Oh, and I'm going to recommend immediate probation in my report.
What does that mean?
It means that I'll be monitoring you very closely, Ms Summers.
And if I don't see that things are improving, I'll be forced to recommend that you be stripped of your guardianship.
You can't do that.
I do what is in Dawn's best interest as should you.
Have a nice day.
Didn't go well, huh?
Why won't you go?
- I just thought you'd want - Get out of here!
Just getting what I came for, love.
So long, Goldilocks.
Well, I think I can work with this.
What exactly would you like me to do?
Just make me different.
- What if we get caught?
- No way.
We'll be invisible.
- Plus their security's gotten lax.
- You should know.
You've cased it enough.
OK, this is it.
Remember we're professionals.
- Uh, Slayer!
- What?
Where?
There.
Headed this way.
- Give it!
- I need to be invisible!
I need it more!
Buffy can't see me!
- Watch it!
Don't touch the Oopsie.
What happened to Buffy?
She's gone.
She's right here.
Table four.
I put her with your family.
Great.
Except we don't hate Buffy.
Let's put her back at table one.
- Well, where do I put D'Hoffryn?
- We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
I have to, he's my ex-boss.
You're inviting your work buddies.
- She's got a point.
- Hey, Buffy Where where are you?
At table four, apparently.
Well, that remains to be seen.
Like you.
Don't strain yourself looking, Xander.
I'm Invisible Girl.
- Uh, Xander?
- Sorry!
Her clothes are invisible too.
Buffy, how did this hap Wait a sec.
Have you been feeling ignored lately?
Yeah, ignored - I wish.
No, this isn't a Marcie deal.
I left Main Street after getting my hair cut - You cut your hair?
- Oh, yeah!
Really?
How short?
About up to here.
If you could see my hand, it's kind of above my shoulders.
Sounds adorable!
I was thinking of getting my hair cut Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy?
This is serious.
I know.
It kinda fits the day I've had.
Willow's still a wreck, Dawn's mad at both of us, and the social services lady put me through a wringer.
Says she's gonna "watch" me.
Like to see her try now.
You know, there may be an upside to no-see me.
Buff, did you see anyone or anything suspicious before you cleared up?
Nope, didn't see nothin'.
See what I did there, with the eyeballs?
Why would anyone make her invisible anyway?
I mean, an invisible slayer's gotta be way more effective than the standard variety.
I'm less with the why and more with the how.
We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again, right?
'S all right!
Buffy, could you focus, please?
I am.
Just this is kinda fun.
Well, it would help if we had a little bit more to go on.
Or anything to go on.
Well, I could go check the spot where Buffy disappeared, snoop for clues.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you know what?
I'm just gonna go for a walk.
- A walk?
- Yeah.
Clear my head.
You guys keep working on the whats and hows.
- Clear my head!
- Buffy!
Well, seems pretty obvious it's some kind of spell that's done this to her.
A spell from who?
You said it yourself, it makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible.
- Maybe it's a mistake.
- A magical mistake.
Who'd be messing with that kind of pow - Willow.
- Xander.
- How's it goin'?
- Um good.
I found out some stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum.
It's called the Illuminata.
There's rumours it has quasi-mystical quantum properties.
Willow, we need to talk.
We are.
Well, I'm talking and you're looking at me funny.
Is there something you wanna tell me?
It was nothing.
I I didn't slip.
Will, nobody's mad.
Relapse is a part of recovery, we understand that.
We just have to figure a way to fix it.
- Fix what?
- Fix Buffy.
- Buffy's broken?
- Will, you know what I'm talkin' You don't know.
Rhymes with blinvisible?
What?
Buffy was leaving the haircutting place when she - Buffy got her hair cut?
- Yeah!
Adorable, apparently.
I personally couldn't tell, since she's all blinvisible.
And you think I have something to do with this?
No.
Not Will, your spells have caused weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another.
- And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
- Oh.
I see.
So now when anything nasty happens, I get conveniently blamed for it?
No one's blaming.
So I guess it wouldn't matter if I just jump off the wagon completely, since you already think I'm making pit stops.
Well, look, if you say you didn't do it - Willow, where you going?
- For a walk.
Couple of circuits are burned out and the wiring's all fried.
But we had so many plans.
Naked women, and all well, all the naked women.
- It's your fault.
If you hadn't grabbed it - We got bigger problems, bonehead.
The Slayer's invisible now?
He's right.
She could be anywhere.
Even here, right now.
Watching, listening to every word we say.
For all we know, she could be one of us.
- Oh - No, wait, no, guys, that isn't true.
I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
Says you.
In my book, an invisible slayer means a whole world of trouble.
I am the ghost of fashion victims past.
Studded caps?
Not a good idea.
Hey!
I'm doing you a favour!
Nah.
Too easy.
Hmm So long, copper!
Hey!
Hey!
That's mine!
Stop!
Hello, Mrs Kroger.
What?
Where's my Losing my mind.
OK, who's the Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
What?
- I didn't say anything.
- Not you.
The mug!
It's But l I heard something.
Kill, Doris.
Kill everybody.
- You know you want to.
- Shut up, shut up!
Just shut up!
OK No No Yahtzee!
Doris.
I've got a few, so if you wanna discuss that case file now What?
Oh.
Oh, yes, the Summers file.
It's right over here.
It's a 15-year-old girl, living under her sister's guardianship.
The house is a complete What is this?
"All work and no play make Doris a dull girl"?
- What?
- "All work and no play make Doris" The pages are filled with it.
I I I I didn't do this.
I - It was the voice.
- Excuse me?
There was a voice before.
It made my coffee dance.
- It told me to - To what?
Nothing.
Doris take the rest of the day off.
- See your doctor.
- What about my cases?
We'll put someone else on them.
- And have them redo the Summers interview.
I'm not crazy.
I am not crazy.
Hey, Will.
Whatcha doin'?
I figured out this was where Buffy disappeared from what you told me, so don't start jumpin' to any conclusions.
No jumpin'.
Look, feet firmly planted.
I'm not feeling like myself right now.
Sorry.
Me too.
Sorry.
So, what have we found out so far?
Take a look at that!
Something sped outta here pretty damn quick to make that kind of tread mark.
- This could have been made any time.
- Yeah, but this wasn't.
What is it?
- Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
- What fire hydrant?
- Ow!
That one.
Whatever hit this hydrant hit it after it was made invisible.
Betcha by golly wow that something was the same something that shot out of that alley.
Black paint?
Buffy's phantom van.
We need to let Buffy Whoa!
There's something there.
It's a pylon - one of those orange traffic cones.
You should take it to the Magic Box.
It might help you and Anya figure out what spell was used.
- What about you?
- I got paint scrapings and the tyre mark.
I'm gonna find this van that's been stalking Buffy.
By the way, where is Buffy?
Oh, my God, the blood!
Look at all the blood!
Whatever beastie you are, I know you're here.
And I hurt beasties.
Hey, watch it.
A ghost, is it?
Go and haunt the living, like a good spook.
- Buffy?
- I told you stop trying to see me.
- Oh, I got it!
- Really?
We'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table and move your Uncle Rory to a table five near the bar.
An, honey, we're looking for invisibility spells here.
Well, obviously I haven't found anything yet.
At least, nothing that would explain why things near Buffy become invisible.
Ew!
- Xander - What happened?
An unpleasant tactile experience, like putting my hand in pudding.
Ew!
Like pudding, am I right?
Rice or tapioca - lumpy like that.
We have to find Buffy.
She's gotta know.
I don't think Buffy will be broken up over a pylon.
Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon will probably happen to her.
If we don't find Buffy I mean, if we don't figure out how this was done She's pudding?
What do you mean, she'll fade away?
The Slayer got slammed with a big-ass dose of radiation.
Her cells are mutating.
Eventually her molecular make-up will lose its integrity and then - But wouldn't that kill her?
- Let me think Yeah.
Wait a minute.
We're not killing anybody.
Especially not Buffy.
You guys are so immature.
We're villains!
When will you get that into your thick skulls?
- We're not killers, we're crime lords!
- Yeah.
Like Lex Luthor.
He tries to take over Metropolis, but he doesn't kill Superman.
Because it's Superman's book, you moron!
But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?
Listen, Warren, you get that ray working and the first thing we're gonna do is find Buffy and re-visible her before it's too late.
You got me?
Fine.
Whatever you guys say.
Spike?
Spike?
What are you doing?
What am l What does it look like I'm doing, you nit?
I'm exercising, aren't l?
Exercising.
Naked.
In bed.
A man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go.
You gotta keep fit for the killing.
Uh-huh.
Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs.
Mini disaster area.
You come here to criticise my housekeeping?
- No, no.
I'm looking for Buffy.
- Haven't seen her.
Well, you wouldn't.
She's come down with a slight case of invisibility.
Yeah?
How did?
We don't know yet.
Anyway, she's not at the house, and I really, really need to find her.
Tell you what, I'll take a peek around first chance I get and if we bump into each other, I'll clue her that you're on the lookout.
After your exercises.
Yeah, right.
You know, kidding aside, Spike you really should get a girlfriend.
That was bloody stupid.
What's the matter?
Ashamed to be seen with me?
Come on.
He had no idea I was here.
This is perfect.
Perfect for you.
Well, picture me confused.
I thought this is what you wanted.
What I want This vanishing act's right liberating for you, innit?
Go anywhere you want.
Do anything you want.
- Or anyone.
- What are you talking about?
The only reason you're here is that you're not here.
Of course.
As usual, there's something wrong with Buffy.
She came back all wrong.
You know, I didn't ask for this to happen to me.
Not too put off by it though, are you?
No!
Maybe cos for the first time since I'm free.
Free of rules and reports - Free of this life.
- Free of life.
Got another name for that - dead.
Why do you always have to I thought we were having fun.
Yeah now.
But sooner or later your chums will work out a way to bring you back to living colour.
You need to go.
Get dressed if you can find your clothes, and push off.
If I can't have all of you, I'd rather That's cheating.
I don't believe this.
He threw me out?
He threw me.
Did l, like, fall into some backward dimension here?
Is this Bizarro World?
And after he's always going on and on about being the only one that understands me.
"We're alike, you and me.
Birds of a bloody feather".
Oh!
He's so Hey, I'm walking here!
Insensitive.
That's what he is.
Willow?
Willow?
Dawn?
Hey, Dawn, come here.
You wanna see somethin' neat?
- There you are!
- Buffy?
Where are you?
I'm invisible.
Check this out.
Whoo, whoo!
Unidentified flying pizza, comin' in for a landing.
- What are you talking - OK, not the most clever ad lib.
- But, come on, points for spontaneity!
- Stop it!
Just stop.
Sorry, Dawn.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to freak you out.
What did you think would happen?
You're invisible, Buffy.
I know.
Xander and Anya are on it.
Muldering out what happened.
What about you?
Shouldn't you be working on it?
- Of course l - Do you even care who did this to you?
Or if you're gonna be stuck this way?
You're making jokes and flying pizzas.
- I don't think that's - I can't talk to you like this.
I can't see you!
- How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
- Dawn!
Dawn!
Buffy, it's Xander.
Where are you?
We got a new problem here.
- Tell her!
- I'm trying.
We think whatever made you invisible is killing you.
- Tell her about the pudding!
- Anya!
Buff, if we don't if this isn't reversed, you're gonna well, dissolve, or fade into nothing.
Wow.
Now!
Hey!
Let go of me!
Congratulations.
You're our first hostage.
Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander.
If he calls Xander?
Just listen, Slayer.
You don't have a lot of time.
Who is this?
You sound familiar.
I'm nobody.
No one you know.
We've got your friend Willow, and if you don't want anything nasty to happen to her, you'd better meet us.
Alone.
Where?
Hey!
Stay still and you won't get hurt.
- You OK, Will?
- Buffy?
- Where are the bad guys?
- All round you, Slayer, so don't try anything.
He's bluffing, Buffy.
There's just three of them, I think.
More than enough to cause serious carnage, right, guys?
- Guys?
Guys!
- Kick!
Use the kick!
I tried.
He blocks it with his drunken-monkey fist!
Ooh, scary video carnage.
- Hey!
Slayer's here.
- Sorry.
Didn't see her.
Let's continue in a less crowded area.
Like over there.
- Where?
- Over Follow me.
Ow!
I'm gonna guess, you're the ones that did this to me?
- It was an accident!
- Who's that?
- Nobody you know.
- They're the ones from your mystery van.
Oh.
You.
So what annoying thing are you gonna do to me now?
- Save your life.
Make you visible.
- I'm meant to believe that?
They told me everything, Buffy.
Something's happening, you're - Fading away.
I know.
- I can fix that.
- Pick up that air-hockey mallet.
- What for?
It'll give me a target to aim at.
Now hold still and all your troubles will soon be gone.
- You're on the wrong setting.
- What?
The gun - it's not set for reversing the particle ionisation.
It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution!
- Mind your own business.
- What's she saying?
Buffy, he's trying to kill you!
Willow!
Ow!
- OK, playtime's over.
- You haven't won yet, Slayer.
No.
That comes after I beat the snot out of you.
You'll have to find me first.
There's three of us, against just one of you.
- You lied to us.
- Fight her yourself.
- I go down, we all go down!
- I promise, you're all going down.
We may not have your powers, Slayer, but you'll find we are not so easy to Ow!
Get her!
Wait a minute!
Who's biting my leg?
- Sorry!
Where is she?
- Here.
She can't find us if we split up.
- You go that way.
- Which way?
- That way!
Over Just keep talking, boys.
Ow!
Watch the chest hair!
I know that voice.
You're Jonathan?
You have chest hair?
Warren?
- Who are you?
- Andrew.
I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school?
- During the school play?
- He's Tucker's brother.
- Yeah, he's Tucker's brother.
- Oh.
So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch-nemesisesses.
You may have beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time um next time Maybe not!
- It's locked?
You were supposed to check it!
- I forgot.
I give you my arch-nemesisesses.
What's goin' on in here?
I got a bunch of scared kids saying this place is haunted!
Oh, my God, Buffy!
I know.
They're gone.
I guess we should chase them.
No, your hair!
It is adorable.
Pretty neat, you finding the van.
So, how did you manage to do it exactly?
I mean, to locate it?
The hard way.
The spell-free way.
The "oh, my God, my head's gonna fall off, my feet are killing me" way.
I don't know how I got through this day.
Well, the important thing is that you did.
It's a good first step.
How are you doing, post-invisibleness?
OK.
I still have to do some damage control from my giddy-fest.
Dawn was pretty freaked out.
The whole "taking a vacation from me" thing didn't work out too well.
Tell me about it.
Except when I got Xander's message - you know, that I was fading away - I actually got scared.
Well, yeah.
Who wouldn't?
Me.
I wouldn't.
Not too long ago I probably would have welcomed it.
But I realise I'm not saying that I'm doing back flips about my life, but I didn't I don't wanna die.
That's something, right?
It's something.
So I guess we both made good first steps.
I guess.
- Yay for us.
- Yay.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Previously: - You never had it so good as me.
If you tell anyone about last night, I will kill you.
So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch nemesises ses.
You might've beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time Maybe not!
- Amy?
How've you been?
- Rat.
You?
- Dead.
- Oh.
It's nice having another magically inclined friend around.
It's too early to go home yet.
What d'you wanna do?
- I have a better idea.
- Is it dangerous?
Let's get outta here.
Dawnie, I'm sorry.
I'm so - You could've killed her.
- I need help.
No more spells.
I'm finished.
There's some money stuff we have to talk to you about.
You're telling me I'm broke?
- How bad is it?
- Anya says pretty bad.
Buffy, some discussion about what you're gonna do now.
I've been giving that a lot of thought, actually, and I think I've figured it out.
I get Warren being the super-villainy type, but I thought Jonathan learned that lesson.
I've never heard of this other guy.
You should have seen their headquarters.
It was like the nerd natural habitat.
If we know where they are, let's do something.
We tried.
Buffy was gonna go in and bust'em on the spot.
- I'm sensing a "not so completely".
- She went in and Speaking of Buffy, isn't she ready?
She'll be late for her first day.
Hey, respect the narrative flow much?
Please continue the story of failure.
So Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out.
And then she brought back the stuff that they left: some spell books, some parchments, a couple of rare things - charmed objects and a conjurer's harp.
And they had other stuff.
Razor scooters, pictures of the Vulcan woman on Enterprise.
Ooh!
I mean nerds.
OK.
See, this is why demons are better than people.
Interesting turn.
When I was a vengeance demon I caused pain and mayhem, certainly.
But I put in a full day's work doing it and I got compensated appropriately.
Welcome to today's episode of Go, Money!
Go!
I hear it daily.
Yep, for the rest of your life.
But super villains want reward without labour to make things come easy.
It's wrong.
Without labour there can be no payment, and vice versa.
The country cannot progress.
The workers are the tools that shape America.
Good to know.
I was kind of feeling like a tool.
And now I know why.
You've seen us in your city or small town, ordered delicious food from our happy employees.
But now you're seeing it all in a new way from behind the counter.
You've just become part of the Double Meat experience!
I'm part of it.
- I'm part of it.
- I'm a part of it, too.
This cow and chicken don't know it yet, but they're destined to become part of it as well.
So what happens when a cow and a chicken get together?
That's a Double Meat Medley!
Let's take a look now at the process of harvesting these two special meats.
Holy crap!
..
washing your hands after each visit to the rest room.
Follow these rules and you'll be a happy part of the Double Meat family for a long time!
- Interesting, isn't it?
- Oh, yes!
Like how the cow and the chicken come together even though they've never met.
It's like Sleepless in Seattle if Meg and Tom were, like, minced.
I'm Manny the manager.
It's not a joke.
It's just my name.
Right.
You mentioned that a couple of times when I filled out the application.
Why do you want to work here, Buffy?
You seem like a sharp woman and there are a lot of other jobs.
I kinda need money pretty quickly, like, today, so I didn't want a lengthy interview process.
And I figured this was probably the fastest way to Because l wanted to be part of the Double Meat experience?
Hm.
Come on, let's take a tour.
Phillip, Timothy, this is Buffy.
She's gonna work the counter.
Hi.
What happened to the other one?
Katherine?
- Emily?
- Yeah.
She's gone.
What happened?
Whatever always happens.
- You can use this one.
- There's someone's stuff in there.
They must have left it.
You can toss it or keep what you want.
- Sure they're not coming back?
- We have a lot of turnover here.
- Watch these two.
- Are they gonna do something?
They're solid.
Follow their example and you won't go wrong.
- They're lifers.
- Lifers?
In it for life, like me.
You wanna get something out of this, you'll do the same.
You put the work in, and 10 years from now you'll be where I am, I promise you.
Congratulations.
You're on the clock.
This is the kitchen - the beating heart of the Double Meat Palace.
Wow.
- They're all so identical.
- Yeah.
They all start to look the same to me, too.
Oh, no, not the employees.
The chicken slices.
Yeah.
Medley Meal number two - double-size it.
Drive-through's over there.
High-pressure job.
You won't need to go in there.
Over there's the grill, the fryers, the walk-in freezer.
You don't need to go in there either.
That's the dehydrated-pickle storage.
Those are locked.
Now I wanna show you this.
Look.
The Double Meat Medley.
Oh, I know the Medley.
It's just the video was kind of graphic with the slaughter.
A classic double-decker with a twist - a pure beefy patty above the mid-bun and a slice of processed chicken product below the mid-bun.
Plus pickles and the secret ingredient.
- Eat it.
- Oh, you know, I had a big breakfast.
I'll just wait for Oh But it smells so good.
Mm.
So what is the secret ingredient?
It's a meat process.
Now I think it's time to start earning your money, don't you, Buffy?
Mm-hm.
What's the deal with Manny the manager?
And can I write a children's book called that?
- Fill this while I get the fries.
- Fill this?
I didn't know there was gonna be drug testing on this job.
You're funny.
You better stop that.
- Why?
- Productivity.
One of Manny's watchwords.
"Levity is the time thief that picks the pocket of a company".
I prefer "Manny's a humourless dolt who picks the pocket of he-should-bite-me".
You really need to be quiet with that.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I'd like a small coffee and cherry pie.
That's $1.92, ma'am.
You hit so many buttons, it was like button-palooza.
No, it's easy.
Look.
There are little pictures of the food on the buttons.
I hit the coffee button, then I hit the small button and then cherry pie.
- There's a picture of a little fried pie.
- Uh-huh.
Then I hit the total button, put the money in the drawer, close it and it resets the system.
A cocker spaniel could do it.
Why don't you take the next one, the family?
They're regulars.
- Hi.
I'm new.
- I come here every day.
- That's nice.
- Oh, you really might make it, dear.
Not like some of them, where suddenly you never see them again.
- I can see you here for a long time.
- That's great.
Thank you.
Hi.
Welcome to the Double Meat Palace.
May I help you?
Two number four Medley Meals, a Junior Medley, a Fisherman's Medley and a Kid's Meal.
Plus three fries, a chocolaty shake and extra pickles on one of the Medleys.
Excuse me.
This button - does it look chocolaty to you?
You don't need to be in there.
Sorry.
I was just curious.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Theory number five: cat burgers.
Hey, Buffy!
We're supporting your subsistence-level work.
Bravo.
Thank you.
This is cool of you guys.
So, Buff, how's it going?
I don't know.
I've waitressed before, but this is different.
- When have you waitressed?
- That summer in LA.
It was a diner and we had, you know, lots of people who didn't tip, and funny, funny health-code violations but it wasn't like it is here.
I think there's something wrong here.
- Will, are you OK?
- Sorry, l Yeah.
Something's wrong?
There's this manager, right.
He's all scary and mysterious, you know.
And there's the secret ingredient.
And the people that work here, they're kind of strange, you know.
They just stare into space, plus they disappear.
- Disappear "poof"?
- No, not "poof".
Well, I don't think so.
It's fast food.
I have swum these murky waters, my friend.
There's the assorted creepiness, staring, the enthusiastic not-showing-up-at-all.
You're seeing demons where there's just life.
I didn't say demons.
It's just a vibe.
You guys still haven't seen this manager.
Well, isn't that him over there getting the pickles wet?
- With the saddle shoes?
- And glasses?
Maybe it's just the video that creeped me out, with the cow and chicken all swirly together.
Mm, make me hungry, why don't you?
How's about one of those delicious Medley Meals?
OK, you got it.
On me.
Hey, thanks!
She'll be fine once she settles into the routine.
And by ordering, I'm helping.
- Getting a free meal?
- Well, yeah.
If you like the food here, maybe we should get it for the reception.
- You're serving burgers?
Cool!
- Well, time is running very short.
After Willow gave us the engagement party, I figured she'd help, but now that's all been blown to hell.
Hey, standing right here.
Standing right exactly here.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to tempt you.
Everyone's so delicate.
Anyway, I still have to select the bridesmaids' dresses.
Then there are the guests from the demon realm.
You wouldn't believe how many have yet to let us know.
- There you go, and I double-sized it for ya.
- Oh, thank you!
And cut way back on the cat.
- Cat?
!
- Just kidding.
Probably.
Slow night.
Gina.
Since it's slow, you think they'll mind if I take another break?
We're not allowed.
Downtime robs us all.
Hm, thus quoth Manny.
There's no one here.
Sure there is.
Look.
This'll make my day complete.
- What?
- What's in the Double Meat nuggets?
I'm working.
Go away.
Yeah, and you chose to be in the consumer service profession, and I'm a consumer.
- Service me.
- Order something or go.
Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust.
Damn fluorescent lights make me look dead.
Some demons love'em.
The way they vibrate makes the skin twitch.
That the kinda demon you are, love?
I'm not a demon.
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
Oh.
I see.
That why you took this job?
Prove something to yourself?
A normal job for a normal girl?
Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.
I'll be fine.
Buffy.
You're not happy here.
Please don't make this harder.
You don't belong here.
You're something You're better than this.
- I need the money.
- I can get money.
Walk with me now, come on.
I I need to go help Gary with the fries.
You gotta get outta here.
This place'll do stuff to you.
This place'll kill you!
Someone there?
Oh, hi.
What are you doing?
What what?
Argh!
Feels like I just left, you know?
You came back.
I came back.
- Gary's gone.
- Gary?
- The guy that helped me out yesterday?
- He didn't show up this morning.
Well, shift's just starting.
He was supposed to unlock early this morning.
Didn't show.
Pull his card.
Well, I'm sure, you know, he's just late.
He didn't seem like he was leaving.
I'm moving Timothy to counter.
You're on grill.
- Me?
- I've been watching you.
But I don't know how to grill.
Just think, this is the last day you'll ever be able to say that.
You put the beef on the grill, hit the button, then it beeps.
You flip the beef, hit the other button, then it beeps.
You put it on the bun There's not a button for that.
Repeat until insane.
It eliminates variation.
Every burger at every Double Meat Palace is the same.
People don't like variation.
- Got it.
Variety is the spice of bad.
- Mm.
So what's the secret ingredient?
It's a meat process.
- Well, what does that mean?
- It's a process.
They do it to the meat.
- But what is it?
- It's just the name of the process.
Oh.
Yeah.
So I guess we're gonna get kinda greasy, huh?
Hm.
Skin, hair, eyelashes, nostrils.
Inside your ears.
You wanna look inside my ears?
No.
No, that's OK.
Once I noticed I couldn't hear and went to the doctor.
He said it was grease that made a plug.
- Oh.
- Mm.
I got me a kit.
A kit for cleaning my ears.
It's got this little bulb mechanism.
Imagine that.
Buffy?
Yay!
It's Manny!
- You're working a double shift.
- What?
Another eight hours right after these eight hours?
But that's so many hours.
You get paid for it.
Plus an extra free Double Meat Medley.
What happened?
Why the double shiftiness?
Gary didn't show.
And now one of my grinder guys is late too.
But they could still show up, right?
I mean, they could be anywhere.
Your meat's here.
Yeah, OK.
Bye.
An, that was Buffy.
She's working late, so I might have to go I have been called and vengeance shall I wreak.
Cower, masculine one.
Tremble as you face my wrath.
I'm starting to think we should do a potluck thing.
Honey.
Hello.
I am here to tear this man apart.
How many pieces do you wish?
- Halfrek!
- Anyanka?
!
Oh, my God!
Hey!
How are you?
How are you?
You two, you know each other?
I didn't summon you to kill Xander.
I called to invite you to our wedding.
Oh, my What an embarrassing mistake!
Oh, my God!
Gorgeous!
Wow.
You two clearly have some catching up to do, so I'll I'll not be in the apartment.
It's swell to see you again.
I didn't mean to have you materialise all the way here.
- Not until the ceremony, I mean.
- I guess I got the message garbled.
You know how it is.
Half the time I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy.
So, um you're marrying that man with the large upper arms?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, because I love him.
- Hm.
- We're gonna be very happy together.
- Hm.
What?
It's boiling with nothing in it.
Sometimes it does that.
They say bugs fall in there.
Oh, I'm back.
You can go on your break now.
- Come in.
It's me.
Dawn said I could come up.
So, is she pissed at you too or just at me?
What did you tell her about me?
D'you want something?
Um Yeah, actually.
I mean, I don't know if you wanted to keep it or You want it?
Really?
Well, yeah, you know.
I mean, it's not much, but it's home.
Or it was.
- I don't know.
I guess it's stupid, but - No, it's not stupid.
You can have it, of course.
Hey.
So I hear you got this whole cold turkey thing going on.
- How's that going?
- It's good.
It's really good.
I mean, it was hard at first.
Frustrating doing everything the slow way.
It was like "Is everything gonna take for ever, for ever"?
Yeah.
But it's better now.
I'm getting my focus back.
Mm.
I can see that.
It's a pivotal page.
So this is it, huh?
This is gonna be your life from now on?
What?
No.
Well, you're never gonna do it again.
Ever.
You're never gonna feel how it made you feel.
Don't think that's the way to look at it.
Hey, Will.
It's your birthday.
No, it isn't.
But now that you mention it, Buffy's is coming Potestas.
What?
Amy It's a gift.
It's magic.
And it didn't come from you.
It came from me.
Completely legal.
Enjoy.
- Look what I found under the meat grinder!
- Oh, my God.
- Wanna tell me what's going on?
- I'm not sure.
Try again!
Well, there was an accident, maybe, six weeks ago.
A grinder incident.
Right, but this isn't six weeks old.
This is new.
It is?
Oh, well, maybe Gary did come in this morning or late last night.
Maybe there was an accident and he got himself to the hospital.
Right.
Maybe he's in the hospital.
Or maybe he's in the grinder!
Huh?
Huh?
Meat process?
Secret ingredient?
Maybe Gary's on the grill!
Or maybe he's under the pickle chips!
Buffy.
Buffy!
Stop!
Stop!
Everybody, you have to stop!
Stop eating.
No, you can't eat it!
It's not beef.
It's people!
The Double Meat Medley is people!
The meat layer is definitely people!
It's people!
Probably not the chickeny part.
But who knows?
Who knows?
What about the cherry pie?
What are you doing?
I thought you were part of the team!
You are fired.
Tell me more about Xander.
You keep asking about him.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
- Do you?
- No!
Xander, he He's very kind and brave.
And he has the sweetest smile and the nicest body, and he loves me.
Sometimes it isn't easy, but he does.
Who told you that it isn't easy to love you?
Well, I'll do something or say something and then he has to say stuff like "It's incorrect for you to appreciate money so much" or "Observe: here is how a real human would behave".
Oh, so he corrects you?
Well, no, it's just Well, now I'm all confused.
You think there's something wrong with the way he treats me?
Do you?
OK, you have to stop doing that.
I love Xander.
Even though he thinks he knows better?
- But he doesn't.
He doesn't think that.
- OK.
I'm sorry.
I was just curious.
You don't have to say another thing about it if you're not comfortable.
But I am!
I mean, it's not like I'm hiding any deficiencies or anything.
Hm.
I have absolutely no threes.
Go fish.
I call an emergency meeting, and this is it?
Where's Willow?
Anya?
I couldn't find Willow.
I knocked and knocked on her door.
Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie.
Say, Buff, did you ever see Anya as a demon?
Cos if that's it, whoa.
There's something wrong at the Double Meat Palace.
Really wrong.
Have you been demon-fighting?
Is that why you smell funny?
No!
I'm talking about Oh.
That's great.
That's just great.
I try to get an ordinary job in a well-lit place and, look, I'm right back where I started.
Blood and death and funky smells.
Look.
Look what I found near the grinder.
Ew.
- Whose is that?
- I don't know.
It might be this guy named Gary, the only one who didn't seem all brain-dead.
He didn't show up this morning.
Except now I think he was there as the secret ingredient.
We need to analyse that burger.
We need to find out if it used to be people.
What?
!
- People?
- Xander, you ate the burger?
!
First you say it's cat, then you come in, hand me a burger, blah blah blah.
Five minutes later "And by the way it happens to be hot, delicious human flesh"!
I needed that burger to analyse it.
Now I'm gonna have to get another one.
That's your problem with this scenario?
You getting seconds?
Late!
Late.
Sorry.
I was reading for school.
Well, highlighting anyway.
Anyway, late.
Yeah, you just missed the Gary burger.
What are we doing?
Let's jump right in.
Did Xander say something about food?
You wouldn't want any.
Apparently, the Double Meat Medley is people.
Whoa.
Bad.
I bet it's not even just this one time.
Or even this one town.
There are Double Meat Palaces all over California.
- I've eaten there a lot.
- Everyone has.
They've got the perfect deal - everyone expects high turnover of workers.
They get the meat for nothing and they have us disposing of the bodies.
How sick is that?
We need to bring down the whole corporation.
Will, Xander ate the burger.
Is there any way for sure to figure out what it was?
Yeah, I can start analysing it with science.
Not I can use science.
You ate it?
We have the wrapper.
There's little scribbles of meat on the wrapper.
You work on that.
It's after closing, so I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
Cool.
You go.
We'll be good.
Are you OK?
I'm just worried about Buffy.
She could be walking into anything.
Manny?
Oh.
Manny?
Guess you really were a lifer.
Don't need magic.
Don't need it.
Don't need it.
My friend Janice - her sister's a lawyer.
You think I should sue over the burger?
That's interesting.
No, I just mean Buffy's never gonna be a lawyer or a doctor, anything big.
She's a Slayer.
She saves the whole world.
That's way bigger.
But that means she's gonna have crap jobs her whole life, right?
Minimum-wage stuff.
I could still grow up to be anything.
But for her this is it.
OK, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or a doctor, and you can support your deadbeat sister.
Oh, that's terrifically better.
Thanks!
- Hey, guys, I think I've got it.
- Good job, Will.
- Those aren't, like, potions, are they?
- No.
No potions.
It's not magic.
It's chemistry.
You can tell by how damn slow it is.
I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood.
So we're pretty close to knowing for certain.
I'm here.
I'm here.
- We're doing chemistry.
- Oh.
So sorry I hurried.
Did your friend have a good time, and then leave?
She's gone.
So, An, the way she looked, with the face That wasn't what you used to look like, was it?
Something wrong with that?
Did you think she was unattractive?
Is there any answer to that question that won't make you nuts?
Halfrek was always considered to be a great beauty.
Well, hon, she was a little There was some veininess.
Hold this.
OK.
If the solution reacts to the proteins, then I'll be able to see it.
I mean, I'll be able to look through the microscope and then see it.
You're not so perfect either, what with your strangely large upper arms and your tendency to criticise.
Huh?
- What do you see?
- There's no reaction.
Oh, God, no!
There's no reaction.
- Which means it's not human.
- It's not human!
- It's not human?
- Well, is it demon meat?
I mean, maybe someone's killing demons and using them as a cheap source of meat.
We've all heard of that.
I'm opposed to using demon meat, no matter how much money it saves.
Surprise you?
Again, I say "Huh"?
No, I'm not sure what I'm seeing.
Cellulose?
There's something weird here.
Scalp?
Wig!
Wig lady?
Oh, dear.
"Wig lady".
Is that what they call me?
I don't care for that.
I mean, I have to do something to hide this.
It's paralysing.
Don't try to move, dear.
You really can't, much.
The paralysis spreads upward, by the way.
You may want to flail your arms a bit while you still can.
Did I tell you?
You're my favourite.
Double Meat workers.
You're so full of Double Meat burgers and you just slide down so smooth.
Oh, I just love the paralysis.
It means I can eat you slowly.
I know you're under there.
Buffy?
Are you in there?
I can't see you inside.
Buffy, if you're in there, the burger isn't people.
They aren't even meat.
It's all processed vegetables.
Isn't that weird?
Buffy, there's more.
Something happened today.
It wasn't my fault.
It was Amy's fault, but I feel so bad about it.
It was Amy's power, but it felt like I was doing everything myself.
And I couldn't stop.
And now it's gone and I feel kinda shaky and like I need it, Buffy.
Buffy, something fell.
Buffy!
Visitors.
How nice.
Missed me.
Oh.
Oh!
Buffy!
Buffy, are you all right?
Paralysed, but I think it's wearing off.
I did it!
I killed her, Buffy.
Look!
Ew.
Hey.
Amy.
Can I come in?
My new place isn't set up and I wanted to borrow detergent.
You really can't.
I can't borrow detergent?
When they call me Stinky Amy I'm just gonna say "Not my fault".
I can't spend time with you any more.
- What?
- You can't come in here again.
What's up?
You didn't like your birthday present?
That's right.
You're telling me that you didn't have a genuine blast?
Come on, that was a sweet spell.
It was like a trip to Disneyland without the lines.
You don't get it.
What you did to me was wrong.
Do you have any idea how much harder that makes just everything?
You know what I notice?
You're not denying that you had fun.
- Shut up.
- Oh, yeah.
Sharp argument you got there.
Were you on the debate team?
I forget.
I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat.
Amy, if you really are my friend, you better stay away from me.
And if you really aren't you better stay away from me.
- Yeah?
Hi.
You must be the new manager.
I'm Buffy Summers.
I'm Lorraine Ross.
They called me in when Manny did his disappearing act.
You hear about that?
Guy just disappeared.
Yeah.
I think I think that used to happen a lot around here.
Wait.
Buffy Summers?
I heard about you.
Caused a big scene.
Oh, yeah.
Practical jokes not really right for the workplace.
I so get that now.
Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform.
Most people don't even bother.
The Double Meat Medley is vegetables?
How do you know that?
So I guess it's true.
Um, close the door?
Have a seat.
It's a texturised, vegetable-based, meat-like product, suitable for grinding.
It's blended with large amounts of rendered beef fat for flavour.
The secret ingredient in the beef is beef?
Buffy, you know something powerful here.
Do you understand that?
The Double Meat reputation is built on a foundation of, well, meat.
You can't spread this around.
I get that.
- It's a valuable secret, isn't it?
- Is there something you want?
- I really need money.
- You want money?
No!
Well, I mean, yes, but, no, l I want to work.
See, I have zero money coming in, and there are expenses.
And by the time I interview for a new job and go through a training process I'd I'd really like to not be fired any more.
I don't want any more practical jokes.
I mean it.
I promise.
Well, I'm a little short-handed right now and you're already trained.
I think you can not be fired.
Thank you.
That's great.
I can do the job.
I promise that, too.
I certainly hope so.
I don't like short-timers, Buffy.
I like people who want to be here.
Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on See this?
I want you to be shooting for this from here on out.
Right.
Here on out.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
- Previously: - We screwed it up.
She's just disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
That the kinda demon you are?
I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.
So, you three have, what?
Banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch Nemesises.
- Dawn, you need to eat.
- Thanks for your concern.
Why is she taking it out on you?
- This isn't gonna work.
- Are you gonna leave me?
- Willow has a problem.
- No more spells.
I'm finished.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Afraid I'm gonna?
- Things have changed.
- I'm disgusted with myself.
We missed the bed again.
Lucky for the bed.
Is this a new rug?
No.
Just looks different when you're under it.
You know, this place is OK for a hole in the ground.
You fixed it up.
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.
- I've been thinking of changing my room.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I think the New Kids on the Block posters are starting to date me.
Well, if you want, I can Are we having a conversation?
What?
No!
No.
- Maybe.
- Huh.
What?
Isn't this usually the part where you kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
That's the plan.
Soon as my legs start working.
You were amazing.
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.
The things you do.
The way you make it hurt in all the wrong places.
I've never been with such an animal.
I'm not an animal.
You wanna see the bite marks?
You know, it's late.
I should get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
- And she's off.
- Have you seen my underwear?
What is this to you, this thing we have?
What?
We don't have a thing.
We have this.
That's all.
Do you even like me?
Sometimes.
But you like what I do to you.
Do you trust me?
Never.
How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
Actually living with super villains was not in the deal.
We're on the lam.
It's not like we have a choice.
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
Stop whining!
Get your sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!
Don't you curse me.
Hey, give me my bone!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hey!
When you girls are done, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
Cool.
Got the thing?
- Musk gland of a Hombja'moleev demon.
Fresh.
All right.
Stand back.
Doma voluntatem.
Libere cupidinem.
Arumpe ignem.
Excita.
OK.
Ow.
Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener is on line.
Now, with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
I know just where to start.
- Doublemeat is double sweet.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Just something I'm tryin'.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.
Gina, I'm takin' a break.
I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
If you close your eyes and smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away.
Eventually.
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.
Is it bad?
I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What did Willow do now?
Did she hurt anyone?
What?
No, no.
Um Tara, this isn't about Willow.
I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
Sorry.
It's Willow's fine.
She's been doing really well.
You'd be proud of her.
Good.
That's good.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's Spike.
He can hurt me without his head exploding.
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.
It still works.
Just not on me.
I need to know about the spell, the one that brought me back.
I I'd ask Willow, but You think it's you.
I don't know.
I feel different.
There are things that I think maybe I came back wrong.
No, Buffy.
That's not No.
You didn't.
Can you check out the spell?
Just see if there's something that Could you just check?
Please?
Right there!
That's got it.
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
Mad Dog Three to Mad Dog One.
- Signal's strong and clear.
Over.
- Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.
Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.
We can really have anyone we want.
- It's like candy.
- Juicy, pulsating candy.
Oh!
The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!
No.
I want the redhead!
The redhead's too tall.
- Get off of me!
Jerk!
- Take it back!
- Target acquired.
- What?
Initiating contact.
- The brunette?
- Oh, she's kinda cute.
Ow!
- Oh, no.
Go for the leather skirt!
- Bazoombas!
- Yeah.
Go for the one with the bazoombas.
- Bazoombas.
Bazoombas.
So how did you get so beautiful?
OK.
Does that line usually wor?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too, Katrina.
It's the seeing you that's throwing me.
I thought I was pretty clear I never wanted that to happen again.
- Never's a long time, baby.
- Apparently, not long enough.
You're not still sore about that thing, are you?
What thing would that be, exactly?
The wind-up slut you tinkered together?
Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
OK.
So I've made a few mistakes.
No.
No, I did.
For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
- No.
Don't say that.
- Well, what did you expect?
To just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
No.
I just thought we could talk.
I thought maybe we could work things out.
There is nothing to work out.
What you did was sick.
Just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
God!
Yes, I'm sure.
I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
I'm home!
Who wants to help scrape the grease off my - Is there singing?
Are we singing again?
- No.
Just the dancin'.
We're teaching Dawn synchronised dance steps for the wedding reception.
Wanna go for a spin?
I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
- Oh.
Rough day?
- Kinda.
You've been goin' at it too hard.
We hardly ever see you.
What with slingin' the Doublemeat and poundin' the big evil.
You are looking a little pounded.
Just around the eyes.
Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later.
Wanna come?
Get all unwindy?
Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.
- No.
I'll stay here with Dawn.
Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and listen to the cars honk?
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
It's OK.
I checked it out.
Janice's mom is picking her up.
Oh.
I didn't think you'd care.
You're never home, so I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm here now, all visible and everything.
- Can't you stay at Janice's another night?
- Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas.
- Not like I knew you'd be around.
Frosty nectar.
Now, please?
- Thank you, baby.
- My pleasure, Master.
That is so cool.
I could've used one of these in high school.
Gentlemen.
To crime.
Crime.
- Crime tastes funny.
- Wow.
I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but Wow!
Yeah, she's really cute.
Cute?
Look at her, men.
The shape of her lips.
The smooth, silky skin.
The way her nose crinkles when she laughs.
She's perfect.
- Yeah.
- She's totally hot.
So are you, Master.
- You think so?
- Oh yes, Master.
OK.
So how do we?
- You know?
- Who gets to?
- I do.
- That's not fair.
- Dude, you didn't call it.
- I don't have to call it.
She's mine.
But don't worry.
You can play with her all you want.
After I'm done with her.
I missed you so much.
You never should have left me.
- Say it.
- I never should have left you, Master.
- Now tell me you love me.
- I love you, Master.
- Again.
- I love you, Master.
I love you, too, baby.
Get on your knees.
Yes, Warren.
Wait.
What'd you just say?
I said "Yes, Warr" What the?
What did you do to me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- Who the hell are you?
- Um, your masters.
- My what?
!
- Where'd you put it?
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Get the dampener!
- You were sharing me with these dorks?
!
Hey!
We're super villains!
- Call us "master".
- Wait!
- Oh, crap.
- It's out of juice.
Is that what you used on me?
Oh, my God!
First the skankbot and now this?
- What is wrong with you?
!
- I wanted us to be together.
There is no us!
Get that through your meaty head.
I am not your girlfriend any more!
- She's your ex?
- Dude, that is messed up.
Oh, you think?
You bunch of little boys playing at being men?
Well, this is not some fantasy.
It's not a game, you freaks!
It's rape!
- What?
- No, we didn't You're all sick.
And I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this.
- Then we'll see how you like getting raped!
- Stop her!
Get off me!
Charge the cerebral dampener.
- Warren - Charge the dampener.
Andrew, get her up.
We'll give her another dose.
A stronger one.
Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't think so.
She's dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Her neck, it just No, that's not - This isn't happening.
- I just I gotta I gotta Let me think.
What'd you do?
What the hell did you do?
!
We did this, me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Shut up!
We have to get We have to get rid of it.
How?
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it outta here?
No.
She's It's too big.
Andrew?
- Andrew?
- What?
Is there anything that you can summon, something that something that can devour that much?
Maybe a Jaarvlen Flesh Eater, but they're hard to control.
It'd go for us, too.
Well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
- Stay calm.
- Tell that to your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend!
- It doesn't matter.
There's a link.
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together?
She'll figure it out!
It was an accident.
Maybe we could turn ourselves in.
- No.
- If we go to the police now - No.
I'm not going to jail.
- We can't hide this!
Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead!
Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
- Are you insane?
- Listen.
- No!
- Listen!
We have two problems: the body and the Slayer.
Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both, with one big stone?
What are they doing?
We're not gonna have to do that at the wedding?
Cos there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
You're still doing OK, right?
Yeah.
You know, some days are harder than the really hard days.
It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
- I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
- No, that's not It's OK.
We know you've been all tied up.
- What?
- With your job and the slaying.
I see sitting where there should be dancing.
- Come share in the joy of our groove thing.
- And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
- I think I'll catch the next soul train out.
- You sure?
Oh, yeah.
You know, glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.
Cool.
Well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricatin'.
You see?
You try to be with them.
But you'll always end up in the dark.
With me.
What would they think of you if they found out all the things you've done?
If they knew who you really were?
Don't.
Stop me.
No, don't close your eyes.
Look at them.
That's not your world.
You belong in the shadows.
With me.
Look at your friends, and tell me you don't love getting away with this right under their noses.
Oh!
I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
The funky monkey claims another victim.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
I mean Uh, it's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
- There's a monkey problem?
- Only if you don't stretch first.
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?
Light reading?
Yeah.
I was just No, it's OK.
I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because You don't have to hide it.
I'm not I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.
But, uh But it's better now.
It really is.
You know, if you were checking on me?
No, I wouldn't - I was just looking for Buffy.
- Oh.
Well, I haven't seen her since last night.
She's not around much these days.
We kinda miss her.
I'm sure she feels the same way.
If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?
It's important.
- Yeah.
Of course I will.
- Thanks.
Will?
I'm I'm glad you're doing better.
Don't think about the evil, bloodsucking fiend.
Focus on anything but the evil fiend.
Thank you.
Huh?
It's OK.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you walk?
Are you hurt?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Spike?
Buffy!
Spike.
What's happening?
So you thought you could just slip away, then?
Vampire, remember?
I could feel you.
Ow!
Bloody hell!
What'd you do that for?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Do you mind?
Buffy?
She's dead.
I killed her.
We have to go.
What happened?
There's nothing you can do.
We have to go before someone sees you.
What did I do?
We have to go, now.
All right.
Listen to me.
Buffy.
Buffy!
- She's dead.
- It was an accident.
But I killed her.
- I'm gonna get you home.
- No.
I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm bed and stay there.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Trust me.
Two problems one stone.
Nice job.
She totally bought it.
Yeah.
Some of my best work.
Uh, what happens now?
The night's young.
Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
We stick to the plan.
Buffy thinks she killed Katrina.
It's her problem now.
What did you do,Buffy?
What did you do, Buffy?
It's all right, love.
Shh.
All right.
It'll be our little secret.
Do you trust me?
Hey.
What time is it?
It's late.
I just wanna I love you.
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
I know I haven't been everything I should be.
Everything Mom was.
But I love you.
I always will.
Why are you talking like this?
Buffy?
There was an accident in the woods.
A girl she was hurt.
I hurt someone.
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.
I have to tell what I did.
I have to go to the police.
The police?
Dawnie, I have to.
But What's going to happen?
I don't know.
They'll take you away, won't they?
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You don't wanna be here with me.
You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You were happier where you were.
You wanna go away again.
Dawn Then go.
You're not really here anyway.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The right thing.
For once.
Sorry, love.
Can't let you do that.
- I have to tell them what happened.
- Nothing happened.
I killed that girl.
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?
They won't believe you.
- I'll show them.
- Show them what?
- What did you do?
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?
!
- What I had to.
I went back and I took care of it.
It doesn't matter now.
No one'll ever find her.
- Where'd they find her?
- The river, half a mile from the cemetery.
Oh, balls!
- There is nothing to connect this to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- It wasn't your fault.
- I killed her!
- It was an accident.
It just happened.
- Nothing just happens.
You are not going in there.
I have to do this.
Just let me go.
I can't.
I love you.
No, you don't.
You think I haven't tried not to?
Try harder.
You are not throwing your life away over this.
- It's not your choice.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?
A girl is dead because of me!
How many people are alive because of you?
How many have you saved?
One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
That's all it is to you, isn't it?
Just another body.
Buffy!
You can't understand why this is killing me.
Why don't you explain it?
That's it, put it on me.
Put it all on me.
- That's my girl.
- I am not your girl!
You don't have a soul!
There is nothing good or clean in you.
You are dead inside!
You can't feel anything real!
I could never be your girl!
You always hurt the one you love, pet.
Buffy?
Buffy.
No, no statements.
Not until I get confirmation.
- Excuse me.
I need to - I'll be with you in a sec.
Sunnydale PD?
Yeah.
Phone's ringing off the hook here.
Listen, you got an ID on that body yet?
Yeah?
OK, shoot.
Katrina Silber.
S-i-l-b-e-r.
- Warren, tell her to go away.
- I can't.
You're keeping secrets from me - other girls and Trina shut up.
- Warren.
- Thanks.
Now, what's the problem, miss?
- Is this what you saw?
- Yeah, that's it.
Hm.
Rwasundi.
Very rare.
Its presence in our dimension causes a sort of localised temporal disturbance.
- So that's why time went all "David Lynch"?
- Right.
Human perception is based on a linear chronology.
Being exposed to the Rwasundi for a few seconds can cause vivid hallucinations.
And a slight tingly scalp.
So that's it.
These things just made you think you killed her.
She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.
He knew Katrina.
He had something to do with it, I know it.
How can you be sure?
You always hurt the one you love.
Does this mean you're not going away?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find Warren and the others.
Whatever they've done, they won't get away with it.
We'll get away with it.
"injuries consistent with a fall".
The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
What about Buffy?
It wasn't that hard messing her game up.
If she figures it out we'll take care of her.
We really got away with murder.
That's kinda cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
- Are you sure?
- I've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Then why can Spike hurt me?
Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but you are different.
Shifting you out of from where you were, funnelling your essence back into your body, it altered you on a basic molecular level.
Probably just enough to confuse the sensors, or whatever, in Spike's chip.
But it's all surfacey physical stuff.
It wouldn't have any more effect than bad sunburn.
I didn't come back wrong?
No, you're the same Buffy.
With a deep tropical cellular tan.
You must have missed something.
Will you check again?
I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
You mean, hit you?
Oh.
Oh really?
He's everything I hate.
He's everything that I'm supposed to be against.
But the only time that I ever feel anything is when - Don't tell anyone.
Please?
- I won't.
Oh, the way they would look at me!
I just couldn't I won't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that.
Why can't I stop?
Why do I keep letting him in?
Do you love him?
It's OK if you do.
He's done a lot of good, and he does love you.
And, Buffy, it's OK if you don't.
You're going through a really hard time, and you're What?
Using him?
What's OK about that?
- It's not that simple.
- It is.
It's wrong.
I'm wrong.
Tell me that I'm wrong, please.
Please don't forgive me.
Please!
God!
Please don't Please don't forgive me.
Please don't
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": You're never here.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That's not true.
- You didn't wanna come back.
I know that.
You wanna go away again.
- I'm in.
- Ante up.
You're gonna play cards?
I have been called, and vengeance shall I wreak.
- Hello.
- Halfrek?
Anyanka?
Hey!
How are you?
You two you know each other?
Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander, I called to invite you to our wedding.
Tara.
What are you doing here?
It's OK for you to be here if you have things that you have to be here for.
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.
Buffy, I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
There has to be.
Why do I feel like this?
Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
Oh.
- Don't tell anyone, please.
- I won't.
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.
No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner someday.
I hate running out in the middle.
It's just there's this thing out there.
- Definitely non-vampire.
- I understand.
Well, maybe when you get back we can set up for your party tomorrow.
Yeah.
This'll take a while, though.
I wouldn't wait up.
Besides, Willow's on birthday patrol, - so there's nothing left for us to do.
- Right.
OK, so finish dinner, homework, and don't stay up too late, all right?
- OK.
- OK.
Run off, huh?
Afraid to face a true warrior?
Ooh, shiny.
Do you think we should set up candles for Buffy's party?
Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
Honey, slugs get turned off by slug.
- Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
- Slugs?
No, the party.
Or, Tara at the party.
- Oh.
- It's just Buffy really wants her there.
It seems important to her, so I told her I'd ask you.
Oh Yeah, of course, she should totally be there.
It'll be great.
Hey.
Hey, Dawnie.
Buffy out patrolling already?
So, anything new about Warren and the nerd herd?
- No, just a big monster hunt.
- A nerd goes into hiding, he really hides.
Does anybody want to come to the mall for birthday presents?
I would, but I've got my group.
You know, the whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing?
We're still looking for a better name.
Oh.
Well, yeah, no, that's good.
You should do that.
- So what about you guys?
- Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
I'd love to go, but I gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew by tomorrow morning.
Sorry, it just looks like one of those nights.
You know?
- Yeah.
- You OK going on your own?
Yeah.
Somehow I'll manage to pull it off.
Buffy?
If we can think of things Jim lost during his years in Shanghai, and things he gained.
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Who wants to?
Dawn?
They need you in the guidance office.
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Just a follow-up after your your loss.
Since I'm new, I thought it would give us a chance to get to know each other.
Great.
I've been looking through your file, and your grades have slipped a little.
I have really hard classes this quarter.
Still, teachers say that you've seemed a little distracted lately.
I'm not.
I'm fine.
OK.
It's just, I know it must seem weird, talking to a stranger about stuff, but I want you to know that if something's going on, something's up, my job - the most important part of my job - is looking out for you.
I'm really OK.
I know there's been a lot of loss.
Yeah.
Kinda.
I mean, yes.
People keep People have a tendency to go away.
And I miss them.
And sometimes I wish I could just make them stop.
Going away.
But, seriously, it's no big deal.
I'm fine.
- We're feeding an army!
- No, they couldn't make it.
So, who's coming?
You invite anyone else?
Just you guys, Willow, Tara.
The gang.
Oh, and Sophie from work.
What?
Like I'm a loser who can't make friends outside her tight little circle?
No.
I'm friendly.
We bonded instantly.
Peas in a pod.
Bonded peas.
Really?
Um What's Sophie's last name?
- OK, shut up.
- We're all over the new-friend thing.
What new-friend thing?
Well, we invited someone for you.
A guy.
- For Buffy?
Really?
- Ah, don't worry, it's not a setup.
Right.
No.
Just an attractive single man, with whom we hope you find much in common.
If you happen to form a romantic relationship leading to babies, and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
I assume that this was an act of kindness?
That'll help with the not throttling.
Hey, I'm gonna get this stuff out there.
People should be here soon.
Hey!
You made it!
Of course, sweetie.
- How're you doing?
- Oh, you know.
Better.
Mostly.
Sometimes.
So, is Spike coming?
No.
He may be a chip-head, but he still doesn't play too well with others.
Besides, I'm definitely not ready to - Come out.
- Yeah.
I'm all stay-inny.
- How are you doing?
- The word "gulp" comes to mind.
Just remember, we're all here to I have to with the thing that l Coming!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
I'm fine.
I How are you?
I'm great!
I mean fine.
I'm Finey McFine fine.
- You look - Thanks.
I mean great.
Thanks.
- You do too.
Is that a new?
- Oh, yeah.
It's nice.
Thanks.
- I'm gonna get something to drink.
- Great.
You should.
You really don't wanna get thirsty.
- Hey, how did it?
- Yes, please.
- Spike.
- Yeah.
Willow mentioned the shindig.
Figured we were all part of the team.
Thought I'd swing by.
- Wait.
What kind of team is this?
- Hi.
We met once before.
Yes.
Yes, we did.
You know: more, merrier, that old thing.
- Hi, I'm Clement.
Clem.
- Tara.
- Buffy, Richard.
- Hey.
He was wondering where the best place was to park.
- Oh, that's easy, just - Buffy will show ya.
OK.
Uh, I'll be right back.
- The guy with the - Skin condition.
He doesn't like to talk about it.
Stupid git!
I don't know.
He seemed cute.
Was he cute?
I mean, I'm not a very good judge, but I think he seemed cute.
I think he seemed cute, yeah.
If we get Buffy, can she start opening the presents?
It's been enough time, hasn't it?
- Not yet, sweetie.
- I think Buffy's busy right now.
Buffy's making a new friend.
A grown-up friend.
What, you mean the guy you invited to set her up with?
Nothing.
It's not like I don't understand why you invited him.
I was there, remember?
I can hear you when I'm in the room, you know?
I do understand these things.
Yes, you do!
- You know I'm in high school, right?
- Yes, you are.
- You wanna slip away for a minute, love?
- What?
- I'll let you blow out my candles.
- Here?
Now?
I don't think so.
You worried about Richard?
You don't wanna make your new boyfriend jealous?
Shut up.
He's sweet.
"Shut up, he's sweet".
Maybe he's not the jealous one.
You think he'll take you out on his ten-speed, pet?
Maybe he'll let you ride in that little basket up front.
Jealous, my ass.
- Uh - See?
It's a battery-operated back massager.
- It's portable so you can take it on patrol.
- Wow.
It's, like, instant gratification for all your little acheys.
Great!
Thanks!
What's next?
Here, do mine.
Dawn - Do you like it?
- It's gorgeous.
I was so nervous.
I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
It still has the security tag on it.
Huh.
That's so weird.
I can't believe they didn't take that off.
Happy birthday, Buffy!
Oh, my God!
- Did you guys make that?
- Yes.
Xander did the building.
I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
Holds basic weapons, plus a few non-basic ones too.
Plus, there's a handsome CD holder.
It's something no one else would have.
A Xander Harris original.
I love it.
Thank you, guys!
Buffy?
Oh!
Sophie!
Welcome!
We're somewhere between presents and cake.
- There is gonna be cake eventually, right?
- Hey.
My mom told me to say thank you right away, cos otherwise I usually forget.
So thank you.
And also I can't have any chocolate, or peanuts or egg yolks.
- Is this the friend you brought from work?
- Yes.
- And sometimes dairy.
- No problem.
Our friend is better.
We can do official introductions now everyone's officially here.
Dawn, get the door.
Sophie, this is Anya and Willow Wish granted.
Hey.
Great party.
- Everyone's having fun.
- I hope so.
I mean, look what time it is and no one's even thinking about leaving.
I can't tear myself away.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Can I get you a drink?
- I'm good, thank you.
- OK.
I think I'll just head back in.
- Well I'll look for you.
- OK.
Ooh, Buffy.
"Can I get you a soda pop?
I think I'm in love".
Stop it.
Someone's gonna see.
Mm-hm.
I had a muscle cramp.
Buffy was helping.
A muscle cramp?
In your pants?
What?
It's a thing.
Right.
- No, you go.
- No, you go.
- No, you go.
- OK!
- It's just a beer run.
I'll go.
- Oh, I can't drink beer, cos, you know, barley.
- But I'll go with you to get some.
- Perfect.
Here we go.
The beer-getting.
- This sucks.
I'm out.
- No way.
I think you're doing fine.
- You wanna try poker?
- Still say it's weird without the kittens.
No kittens.
He's quirky.
Look, we've already been playing for three hours.
It's two something in the morning.
- You can't bail now.
- Yeah, come on, Buffy, stay.
- I wanna bankrupt somebody.
- Oh!
We should totally have a slumber party.
Oh, I don't know I guess, as long as everyone's staying up anyway.
Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy.
How's that cramp, Spike?
Still bothering you?
What?
Oh.
Yeah.
Maybe you wanna put some ice on it.
Hey, Xander, we gotta be at work in a few minutes.
OK.
I can't be late today.
You should go.
Let's find your coat and get you on your merry way.
Spike.
- I don't know why I'm not leaving.
- Me either.
Besides, Richard, you can't skip breakfast.
Growing boy like you.
Me, I used to love breakfast.
In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
With that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful what you put in your mouth, Spikey.
Yeah?
I don't know.
Tummy's making all kinds of gurglies.
Maybe I ought to just feed on whatever's around, even if it doesn't go down well.
- You, uh, work out?
- Okey-dokey.
'Scuse us.
Hey, Passive-Aggressive Guy, you wanna take it down a notch or two?
What, poor dainty Richard can't take a joke?
We do not joke about eating people in this house!
What are you gonna do, beat me up again?
I should have thrown you out.
I was insane to think you could hang out with my friends.
And I was insane to think No, wait.
You were right.
You're insane.
Oh, hi.
Hey.
Breakfast.
Didn't really plan for a sleepover.
No, me neither.
It's weird.
I I have class.
I know I should go I know, it's like I wanna leave, but I don't want to.
Exactly.
- I think it's time for you to go.
- Yeah, well, can't.
Daylight.
- OK.
I'll go.
- I'll get the door.
- Fine!
- Fine!
- I'm actually trying to move right now.
- Me too.
Well this can't be good.
- Something's keeping us in this house.
- Or someone.
Has everyone tried to get out?
What if we just, like, as a group, got up and threw ourselves at the door?
All right.
Count of three.
One two three!
Here we go!
- Hence the problem.
- I really need to go.
- I mean, I have a job to get to.
- I have to open the Magic Box.
I have a shift at the Double Meat Actually, I'm OK here.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Willow and Tara have class, I got the site I know.
We all have places that we'd rather be.
Things we'd rather be doing.
I think the first priority has to be to find a way out.
Sure.
Of course you all wanna leave.
Cos being stuck in here with me would really suck, right?
No, Dawnie.
It's just we have more important things to do.
Yeah, I know.
Important.
Whatever that means, right?
- Dawn?
- What?
- Did you do something?
- Me?
- Do you know something?
You can tell us.
- What would I know?
We're not accusing you of anything, it's just you were kind of taking it personal down there.
Oh.
OK.
So you've all just decided that somehow I'm responsible.
Great.
Here's me basking in the love.
No, it's just, you're upset cos we all wanna leave.
And now we can't leave.
Only thing missing is a cornfield.
There isn't a cornfield, is there?
Dawn, it's OK.
You know, we're not gonna be mad.
- Yeah, only I didn't do anything!
- You sure?
- Want me to ask my other self?
- We're just figuring out what's going on.
Figure it out yourself.
I'm done being talked to like a kid.
Well, sometimes we do something that seems like a good idea at the time.
Like, say, invoke the power of a musical amulet.
And it turns out, not so much.
God!
I didn't do anything!
I wish I had.
I'm glad you're trapped.
How else can I get anybody to spend any time with me?
Dawn, if you want us to spend time with you I don't.
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!
- I think she's possessed.
- She's a teenager.
The phones are all out.
We're totally cut off.
- She's just so angry.
- It happens.
We all went through it.
I know.
I just can't figure out why she didn't come to me.
Well, you have been a little busy lately.
I don't wanna stop the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group can meet later.
Say when we're not trapped in a house.
Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us.
- We need another way.
- I think magic's gonna be our best bet.
Something general, you know?
Cast a wide net.
But Willow.
No, I'll do it.
It's just Obviously I didn't bring any supplies.
Well, we don't have any in the house.
We got rid of everything.
Actually not everything.
I, uh, might have kept one or two things.
Sort of.
Just in case.
That's great!
In a very bad way.
Just bring me what you have.
But then I'm doing this alone.
You need to stay away from it.
- So we're supposed to just wait?
- It won't take long.
All right, somebody wanna tell me what's going on here?
I mean, we're trapped in a house by, what, some unseen force or something.
Who knows what she's doing in there.
And I have to tell you I don't think that's a skin condition.
Release.
Try the door!
No.
Can't.
- What the bloody hell was that?
- That's the demon I killed two nights ago.
Demon you thought you killed.
- It looks pretty bad.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Let's get him upstairs.
We need to get him to a doctor soon.
Hey, it's gonna be OK.
Just trust me, I promise we'll be out of here soon.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
OK, so maybe "soon" was a bit of an overstatement.
So, you ever think about not celebrating your birthday?
Just to try it, I mean.
I'm gonna go check upstairs.
Keep an eye on things down here?
You stay here, OK?
What's that noise?
It's in the walls, isn't it?
Sorry.
Why is it so hot in here?
You're just a little freaked out, that's all.
It'll pass.
He's gonna die.
He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
An And we're just sitting here.
Why are we just sitting?
Why aren't we doing something?
We are.
We will.
We've been through worse.
Not like this.
Not trapped like animals.
Seriously, did someone turn on the heat?
I can't breathe, I just I just can't breathe can't breathe An An, stop.
Stop, An, stop.
Stop.
An!
Listen to me.
You're just freaking out, OK?
It's normal.
You're just you're just scared.
We all are.
We'll come up with a plan, and we'll get through it, all right?
We'll do something.
What?
I don't know.
Let me get you some water, OK?
It'll cool you down.
I'll be back in a second, OK?
Stay here, don't move.
Aaargh!
Xander?
Grab the sword!
Are you hurt?
- Here, let me see.
- Xander.
It's OK.
I'm OK, see?
Sh.
It's all right.
I'm OK.
This is getting kinda scary.
You OK?
Do you care?
Fine.
Stay with Spike.
It's not like I meant for this to happen.
I never said that you did.
I didn't want this.
What did you want?
Nothing.
Dawn, come on.
No.
You don't know.
You have this thing you do.
You have all these friends.
- You have no idea what it's like.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know what what's - Being alone.
- You're not alone.
- Then why do I feel like this?
We haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all.
We can't stay put like cattle, waiting for that thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
I'd say we do another spell, but I think we've tried everything.
Well that's not completely true, is it?
I mean, not everything.
Not exactly.
We're sitting here with an incredibly powerful witch.
Much more powerful than you, Tara.
I'm sorry, only no one seems willing to say it.
- I can't.
- No, see, that's not exactly true either.
Not "can't".
"Won't".
You don't know how much I hate this.
I don't know if there's even anything I could do.
Yes.
And a good way to find out is to sit around and try nothing.
- That was sarcasm, by the way.
- Look - It's dangerous.
- And so is all of us dying.
Will, look, I don't wanna gang up on you but Anya kinda has a point.
We brought you back from it once.
It's one little spell.
We can bring you back again.
No.
I can't.
If I start, I might not be able to stop.
Whose fault is that?
If you hadn't gotten so much of this in your system Hey!
You're gonna back off!
She said no.
That's it.
You're not gonna make her do something she doesn't want to.
And if you try, you're gonna have to go through me first.
Understood?
Fine.
If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, then I will do it myself.
I wish you would have told me.
You haven't really been What?
I haven't been what?
Around.
Dawn, the most important job that I have is looking out for you.
You sound like my guidance counsellor.
She give you a handbook or something?
Talking to the Troubled Teen?
Counsellor?
Wasn't my idea.
I didn't even know we had guidance counsellors.
She called me out of class like I was a total JD.
And you'd never met her before?
No, not until yesterday.
And she got you to start talking about things that bothered you at home?
Uh Yeah.
You didn't, by any chance, happen to express, like, a wish or something to her?
- Maybe just a little.
Honey, come on, this isn't the way.
Calm down.
She knows something.
She knows something.
We have to find out what it is.
- Hey!
- An, just stop for a second.
- There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere.
- Stop it!
Anya, it wasn't her fault.
No!
Half this stuff is from the Magic Box.
How could you do this?
I work hard at that store, and I helped you.
I took care of you.
This is how you say thank you?
Anya, hold on, OK?
Tell her you didn't do this.
Tell her it's a mistake.
No!
Oh.
Buffy How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn?
I mean, you say you didn't put us here, but look at this.
How can we believe you?
Look, I don't think she I don't think it's all her fault, OK?
Someone pretending to be a guidance counsellor made Dawn make a wish.
Guidance counsellor?
You made a wish to someone you've never seen before?
Yeah.
Did she wear a pendant with a dark blue stone?
- And little red flecks.
- Oh, for crying out loud.
Halfrek!
It's Halfrek, a vengeance demon.
- You made a wish to a vengeance demon.
- I didn't know.
Only a vengeance demon can break her own spell.
Nothing else will work.
She's the only one who can get us out of here.
Hallie, get your ass down here!
You rang?
I hope you die, you stupid jerkface!
Anya!
The sword!
Her pendant!
Get her pendant!
There will be no touching of the pendant.
What?
Did you think I'd be stopped by a sword in the chest?
Flesh wound.
Honestly, Anyanka, you used to know better.
How could you?
Why would you do this?
I told you I'd take care of some business while I was in town.
Yeah, but cursing us?
Some of them are in the wedding party.
I just go where I'm William?
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys know each other?
Uh, no.
No.
Not really.
I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
Oh, that was Anya's little raison d'être.
Most of us try to be a little more well-rounded.
And actually, we prefer "justice demon".
OK?
FYI.
Well-rounded?
Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
Oh, it's not a thing.
The children need me.
Hm!
Daddy issues.
Sling all the little barbs at me that you want, Anyanka.
It doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain, and none of you could hear it.
I could hear her crying out everywhere I went in this town.
It was unbearable.
And none of you knew.
You people deserve to be cursed.
Enjoy your time together.
From now on, all you have is time.
Time, and each other.
Good luck.
Wait Wait.
Time, and each other.
It's the curse, Hallie.
For crying out loud.
Fine, the curse is lifted!
We can all leave now!
Dammit.
Thanks.
For before.
And for taking this stuff with you.
No problem.
Just so you know, I was never gonna use it.
I mean, not really.
I I just kept it like a safety net.
Cos there was always this thing in the back of my head.
This, you know, voice, saying, like "What if things get bad?
I mean really bad?
And what if you can't handle it"?
And it made me panic, so that's why I kept a couple of things.
I kept them so I didn't have to think about it, so I could focus on getting better.
I get it.
I really do.
But it's time to work without the net, Will.
You know, I don't know if you noticed, but it actually did get bad in there.
Really bad, and you still said no.
- You have some weird friends.
- News from the file marked "duh".
- We're gonna get him to the ER.
- Then we're gonna talk about payment.
And, Dawnie, there are two words I want you to get used to: "punitive damages".
Think it's worn off?
Just one thing to do.
- Who's pushing?
- Oh, look at the stars.
Good party.
I wanna run barefoot so I can feel the dewdrops between my God, look at the stars!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- Previously: - They want me back, Buffy.
The military.
- This is goodbye?
- Unless you give me a reason to stay, I'm leavin' tonight.
Riley!
- Are we havin' a conversation?
- What?
No!
Maybe.
We're getting married.
Double meat is double sweet.
Enjoy!
- Hey, Buffy.
- We're here to support you.
Bravo.
You see, Buffy, the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this takes a while, is that job security all boils down to one simple thing.
Politics.
Now, I'm not a political animal, but you learn fast around here, or it's - wham!
- "Hello, glass ceiling".
It's not like at Burger World or the Happy Bun, where the power structure is simple.
At the Palace, you keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
It's like Machiavelli says.
- You know Machiavelli?
- Tall guy, bleached mullet, day shifts?
I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting you dropped out of college.
- I'm reapplying.
- Good luck.
Well, gotta motor.
Don't wanna be late for night school.
- You go to night school?
- I'm working on my MBA.
Think I wanna spend my life cleaning grease traps?
Don't forget to lock up before you go.
And the gum under the tables?
You should give it a good scrape before you leave.
- May l?
- See you tomorrow.
Yes, you will.
And the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that % Get the double treat that's so double sweet % Oh, it's hard to beat when the meat meets Oh, why can't I get that stupid jingle outta my head?
Least of your problems now, little girl.
- Wait.
- OK.
OK, let's do this.
Quickly.
What's that smell?
Jeez, Slayer, is that you?
- I've been working!
- Where?
In a slaughterhouse?
- Double Meat Palace.
- Oh.
You know what?
Let's just call it a night.
If it's all the same to you.
If you're eating that stuff, I don't wanna bite you.
You're dead.
You smell like it.
How do you get to say I'm the one who's stinky?
Really, it's cool.
I'll just catch you next time.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Spike?
Ah, it's a fair cop.
You caught me, Slayer.
However, in all honesty, I think we have to say this one doesn't count.
After all, I wasn't exactly hiding.
No, Spike.
No?
What kind of answer is that?
You haven't heard the question yet.
I don't have to.
We both know what you're thinking.
And we both know I'm not the only one thinking it.
No.
Not here.
- Why not?
- Dawn.
She's inside waiting for dinner.
She's counting on me.
- I'm not letting her down by letting you in.
- It's the fear of getting caught, then?
- Reason number one on a very long list.
- Needn't be an obstacle.
- Spike, I mean it.
Come on.
- I hear you're serious.
So am l. I want you.
You want me.
I can't go inside, so maybe the time is right for you to come outside.
Dawn.
Hey.
Hi.
- Rough night?
- The usual.
- I brought you dinner.
- Oh, great.
Oh.
Hm.
I know it's not the most original these days, but I made it myself.
I made hundreds, actually.
But this is the very best one.
It looks kinda squished.
Oh.
Well, just, you know give it a sec.
These babies really bounce back.
Literally.
Buffy, it's not like I don't appreciate it.
I do.
It's just that I can't eat this stuff another night.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
No, it's all good.
I get it.
Tell you what.
Tomorrow, I'll bring home the Fisherman's Nuggets with cheese.
Hey, working lady.
Rough night?
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
No reason.
I just thought you were busy with the slayage cos of that grass stain.
- Some vamp get rough with you?
- He's not getting any gentler.
- He?
- They.
Them.
You know, vampires in the general population sense.
- Now I'm gonna have to wash this.
- Ready for a bold suggestion?
Blow it off.
Dawnie and l are headed out to the Bronze.
Um, do I have your permission?
And wanna come along?
Like how I slipped in that permission request?
Very smooth.
- You guys go.
- Really?
Buffy, are you sure?
It might do you good to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle.
- See your friends - Who'd love to see you.
I'm sure.
But I've seen enough action for one night.
- Home by eleven?
- On the dot.
Have a good time.
Somebody should.
See, this seating chart makes no sense.
We have to do it again.
We can't do it again.
You do it.
The seating chart's fine.
Get back to the table arrangements.
I'm starting to have dreams of gardenia bouquets.
I am so glad my manly co-workers didn't just hear me say that.
Stop wolfing down those chips.
One more bag and you'll pop out of your cummerbund.
You're not even hungry.
You're just nervous.
Yeah!
Wedding, one week.
We have friends, family, demons flying in, a to-do list getting no shorter And do not take my chips.
Hey, guys.
How's the soon-to-be newlyweds?
Nervous?
No!
OK.
I'll just be over here, then.
- Your Arnold Palmer, milady.
- Thanks.
So, how are Mr and Mrs High-strung?
I'm betting they explode.
When I was little, I spent hours imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like.
And now I look at them and just think - You're awfully chipper tonight.
- Can't hide it.
Hm.
Big wedding coming up, lots of date possibilities, you and Tara are speaking again You wanna call her?
Invite her over?
No.
Too soon for so bold a manoeuvre.
But if I did call she wouldn't hang up on me.
- That's progress.
- Hence the happy.
Garbage.
Oh!
Wait!
Wait up, guys!
Wait!
Don't you want your garbage?
Hey, Buffy.
Oh, don't forget, today's trash day.
Thanks.
"Dear Ms Summers, we are sorry to reject" - What's that?
- Nothing.
Huh.
Bronze was fun, in a home-by-eleven-ish way.
You should've come.
Maybe next time.
- Where are you going?
- School.
Oh.
That's good.
Don't you want breakfast first?
Already made it.
See you this afternoon?
Unless you're working.
Tonight, then.
Or, you know, tomorrow's cool.
Don't work too hard.
Bye.
That's where even your best political minds can drop the ball: Zeitgeist.
You don't take the pulse of the public, next thing, you're LBJ handing over to Nixon.
Heard back from your college yet?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- You know, we're out of special sauce.
- I'll get it.
No, no.
Your turn up front.
I'll deal back here.
You take the customers.
Welcome to the Double Meat Palace.
How may I help You.
Hey.
Huh?
- Riley.
- Sorry to just drop in on you like this, Buffy.
- It's you.
- It's me.
- You're here.
- I know.
And were you always this tall?
This isn't the way I wanted it, but something's come up.
There isn't much time.
Understand?
- Not a word you've said so far.
- Right.
I should've known.
Anticipated.
You're working.
- Just counter, not grill.
- I want to explain.
I don't have time.
I'm tracking something bad.
Now it's come to Sunnydale.
My hat has a cow.
I know I'm putting you on the spot, showing up like this, but But, you know, here we are.
I need the best.
I need you, Buffy.
Can you help me?
Hello?
Buffy?
People are waiting.
Buffy.
Buffy.
Wait!
Buffy!
I'm sorry this is all so sudden.
If we get a minute, I'd like to sit down - What is it?
- Suvolte Demon.
Rare.
Lethal.
Nearly extinct, but not nearly enough.
It's close.
- What?
- Sorry.
It's just You still carry around all that James Bond stuff.
It's so cute.
I forgot.
Sorry.
Carry on.
We've been through every jungle from Paraguay up, takin' out nests.
As soon as we put one Suvolte down, a dozen take its place.
They're breeders, Buffy.
One turns into ten.
Ten become a hundred.
If this gets out of hand and there's a war with humans, the humans are gonna lose.
So they're like really mean tribbles?
Sorry.
I've been dealing with these geeks.
It's a whole thing.
- Ready for this?
- Yes, please.
National Forestry Service.
We got a wild bear!
Everybody stand back!
Look out!
Let's split.
Riley!
- You all right?
- I'll feel better when we catch it.
- But it's too fast.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.
- Nice wheels.
- Came with the car.
- Know where we're going?
- Got an idea.
The tag's online.
We'll find it.
- How's your arm?
- It'll heal.
How are you doing?
- Complicated question.
- I just meant - I know.
- I hear ya.
Got some big stories to tell you, too.
If we ever get half a second.
- Did you die?
- No.
I'm gonna win.
Here.
No offence, but this is black ops and you look like a pylon.
Ninja wear?
Battle gear.
Lightweight Kevlar, state of the art.
- What a surprise.
- Boys like toys.
Put it on.
Thank me later.
- You won't look?
- I'm a gentleman.
OK.
So the black-ops life, it's working out for ya?
- Don't suck.
- They got dental?
Yeah, we're covered.
You know, there's not many people I'd ask to risk their life for me, Buffy.
It's really good to see you.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
And, Buffy?
Love the hair.
I think we died on the way to the airport and we're stuck in hell.
- The radio said no traffic.
- It's a hell radio, of course it said that.
We'll never be in time to pick up your stupid uncle.
It gives my uncle Rory more time at the bar.
He'll be happy.
Great.
So he can sleep off his drunken stupor on our newly reupholstered couch.
- He can't afford a hotel.
- Why are you defending him?
I'm not.
I hate my uncle.
I hate my whole family.
That's why I'm marrying you, to start a new family.
Have children.
Make them hate us.
Then they'll get married, we'll sleep on their couch.
It's the circle of life.
The Gnarals are teleporting in in 20 minutes.
If I don't greet them somebody gets incinerated.
Why did we ever agree to have your friends, who are demons, and my family, who are monsters, stay at our place?
Well, I can only do so much, Xander.
Planning this marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy.
Without the laughs.
We should have eloped.
No!
I've been through too much planning this wedding, and it is going to happen.
It will be our perfect, perfect day, if I have to kill all our guests and half this town to do it.
- Cool Ranch?
- Cajun Fiesta.
End of the line?
- I don't see our demon.
- It's not here.
Let me guess.
- Down we go?
- Looks that way.
That's a big first step.
So, Mr Finn, got an extra jet pack for a girl like me?
Sorry, fresh out of jet packs.
Looks like we'll have to share.
This test line's built for one, so if we go together, there's no gear.
Just be you and me.
- I was never big on the hardware anyway.
- Will you hold on to me?
- If that's what it takes.
- Come on.
Ready when you are, Agent Finn.
Riley!
Hey.
Hey, there.
What exactly are you doing with my husband?
Husband?
Wife.
And those aren't code names, like Big Dog or Falcon or?
I didn't think so.
Buffy, meet Sam.
Sam, Buffy.
- Pleasure.
- Demon.
Mine.
- She's good.
- She's a special one.
How long have you been married?
- Four months almost.
- Mazel tov.
Any children?
Buffy, I meant to tell you, when the time was right.
She caught up to us a lot faster than I would've guessed possible.
She does that.
So, you guys do this often?
The whole husband-wife tag-team demon-fighting thing?
It's what brought us together.
I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte.
But not quite.
Call this your wedding gift.
So, guess that's mission accomplished.
- She killed it.
- Oh, honey.
That's OK.
OK?
Wait.
You have been tracking this thing as a couple for two days, and you did want it dead, right?
Oh.
Let me guess.
Captain Can-do here forgot to mention this was a homing operation.
But it's nice to finally meet you, by the way.
Knife.
- What is a homing operation?
- It's my fault.
I should have explained.
That would have saved me some trouble.
Damn.
We're too late.
How could you recruit the Slayer without filling her in on the objective?
That'd be my question.
If we weren't under time constraints, I'd think about ripping you a new one.
- Stand down, soldier.
- He's your boss, too?
Oh, he wishes.
We better regroup.
Buffy, I'd hate to impose further, but you got a safe house?
I have a house.
I think it's safe.
Sometimes you can't even leave.
- Um - I know the way.
I'll fill you in.
On everything.
Sorry the place is such a mess.
I haven't had a chance to give it a good clean.
- Hey.
- Agent Finn returns.
Dawn.
Jeez, look at you.
I think you grew a foot and a half.
A lot can happen in a year.
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Hey, there's the man!
Life taker, heartbreaker.
- You know, figuratively speaking.
- Xander, Sam.
Willow.
- Hi.
- We got your call.
We're here to help.
Just like old times.
Except you being big with the married life.
Hear you're getting hitched.
You're gonna love it.
Congratulations.
Really, both of you.
Just so you know, I'm prepared to hate this woman any way you want.
Thanks, but no.
I don't wanna seem all petty.
Well, that's the beauty - you can't, but I can.
Please, let me carry the hate for the both of us.
Go nuts.
So, what brings you back to town, after you left suddenly with no word?
We've been tracking a Suvolte Demon through Central America.
Killing machine.
- Nearly mature.
- Three months old, growing fast.
They kill the minute they hatch and leave a clear trail.
Yeah.
Just follow the villages with nothing in them but body parts.
Uh Dawn, are you sure you wanna be around hearin' all this?
Oh, come on, Finn.
She looks all grown-up to me.
- That is, if it's all right with you.
- Sure.
Yeah, it's fine.
So, this demon shredded your guys and now you're looking for a little payback?
No.
It came here to the Hellmouth to spawn.
But we think it already hatched its eggs.
The plan was to track it, let the demon take us to its nest.
And now they're gonna hatch a bunch of baby demon things?
Unless we stop it.
So we have to find the nest before Sunnydale turns into the Trouble Meat Palace.
- I wish I'd said something else.
- OK.
So we track down the demon, find the nest, Mr and Mrs Finn make with the killin', and everyone goes home happy.
But seriously, choosing between a photographer and place settings We can't track the demon.
I killed it.
So, who's hungry?
We got - Ice cubes.
- All you can eat.
Buffy, it's good that you killed the Suvolte before it killed us.
Disposable cameras.
D Hah?
Yeah.
You know, little plastic ones, ten bucks a pop.
Arrange'em like table settings.
Guests snap photos.
Breaks the ice.
Then when the wedding's over, you get to take home the pictures.
I like it.
So, demon eggs, any timetable on when they're gonna hatch?
- Hatching's not the problem.
- We think they're for the black market.
There are some military powers that would love to have their own Suvolte.
- Drop it on an urban population - And it cleanses the area.
- Is that a nice way of saying it kills people?
- Lots of'em.
Money's been exchanged.
There's a dealer in town.
Calls himself the Doctor.
Willow, you think you can help with a little locating spell?
I can't do the magics.
Riley says you're coming on as one major-league Wicca.
I got addicted.
The way addicts do.
Two teams.
No civilians.
I'll go out and look for our doctor.
You two find that nest.
- Me and Sam together?
- You find a Suvolte nest, you'll want backup.
I don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer.
You've got speed and power I can't even Let's go.
Xander, are you OK to stay with Dawn?
- Yeah.
- I'll check out some bars, some crypts.
Hey, Willow.
I'm sorry.
I think I really stepped in it in there.
Back in the jungle, we had not one, but two hard-core shamans working for us.
They were working the dark magics, and got addicted.
And now they're gone.
Gone, as in, there's nothing left.
I have never met anyone with enough strength to quit before.
I'm just saying.
Thanks for letting me tag along.
- No problem.
- Maybe not for you.
Gotta tell you, Buffy, I'm a bit intimidated.
I mean, patrolling with the real, live Slayer.
You're like Santa Claus, or Buddha, or something.
Fat and jolly?
Legendary.
And it's not just slayer status I'm talking about.
It's you.
Riley talks about me?
He didn't say anything for a long time, but I could tell.
- He was ripped up inside.
- Good thing he has you.
More like miraculous.
I went down to Central America with the Peace Corps.
One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by I didn't know what they were.
I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the squad.
My first fire fight, I met Riley.
We started talking.
First about tactics, missions, stuff like that.
And then about you.
He thinks I let him go.
Do you wish you hadn't?
I wish things were different.
I'm not trying to I don't You know.
I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Buffy.
There's no bad guys in this one.
The only thing that could help Riley work it out was time.
Lots of time.
Took him a year to get over you.
I'm glad he's over me.
So, you seeing anyone new?
Someone special?
I'm just taking my time, you know?
I don't wanna jump right into anything.
I don't wanna be defined by who I'm with.
Yeah.
Better no guy than the wrong guy, that's for sure.
Sam, you know what?
Um, I think we should split up.
I'm slowing you down.
I knew I would.
This was selfish of me.
No, it's not There's this guy, an informant.
But he's twitchy.
I show up with company and we get nothing.
Cool.
I'm guessing Finn needs me about now.
He's probably off somewhere getting his ass kicked.
You know how wild he gets.
Don't worry about Rye and me.
We're good.
I noticed.
Buffy.
Hey, now.
If I'd known you were coming, I'd have baked a cake.
I need information.
Well, I suppose I could be helpful, if the price is right.
Not sure I'll sell out at Double Meat Palace wages, though.
I need to find a guy.
A dealer.
Calls himself the Doctor.
- Human?
- His traffic isn't.
- Clock ticking?
- Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.
Soon, but not now?
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
You know I do.
Tell me you want me.
I always want you.
- In point of fact - Shut up.
Well, looky here.
I don't usually use the word "delicious", but I've gotta wager this little tableau must sting a bit, eh?
Me and your former?
Must kill.
What can I say?
The girl just needs a little monster in her man.
That's not why I'm here Doctor.
Oh, God.
I thought we'd run you out of town, mate.
Last time I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice sucked out of you by undead ladies of questionable reputation.
Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh Where are they, Doctor?
Where are what?
Why do you keep callin' me that?
Glad to be back in Sunnydale.
Locals speak English.
I knew who to beat for information.
- It's all brought me here.
- Look, crew cut, she's not your bint now.
And, frankly, she always had a thing for me, even when she was shagging you.
Nice.
That's very distracting.
Tell me, before I get unprofessional, where are the eggs, Spike?
Eggs?
You're off your nut.
It must be those drugs they kept you on.
I did warn you.
OK.
We can do this the hard way, or we can do this the fatal way.
- Where are the eggs?
- The Doctor, it can't be Spike.
No need to defend me, love.
Look, it can't be, OK?
He's too incompetent.
It's just Spike, Riley.
Right.
Deadly, amoral, opportunistic.
Or have you forgotten?
I'm takin' this place apart until I find that nest.
Over my dead body.
- I've seen enough of your dead body, thanks.
- You're not You coming?
Oh, this is unconstitutional, is what it is.
Here!
There's nothing to see there.
Riley, I'm not saying he's good.
I'm saying that he's not capable of something as - I can explain.
- We're gonna need more weapons.
Spike screwed up.
You didn't keep'em frozen, did you Doctor?
You can stop calling me that any time.
If I may?
The thing of it is, I'm holding these for a friend, who No more games.
Well, that's bloody funny comin' from you!
No more games?
That's all you've ever done, is play me.
And you keep playin' with rules you make up as you like.
You know what I am.
You've always known, and you come to me all the same.
- Can you shut him up?
- Not so far.
You better get outta here.
- On second thoughts, stick around.
- Riley, l - Aim high.
- I'm not exactly Gun Girl.
You wanna live, learn fast.
These things?
Never useful.
We have to pull out.
- We need a way to contain those things - Riley!
If you love Riley so much, you should marry him.
He's taken.
And that's not the point.
- You think their marriage is better than ours?
- No!
But I can't imagine Nick and Nora Fury hiding from their own relatives in the bathroom.
And I have no idea what Riley and Mrs Riley's wedding was like.
- You haven't shut up about them.
- They have a great marriage.
It bummed Buffy out, but I can see it.
And, Anya, I really have no clue what their wedding was like.
So our wedding is not our marriage.
Separate things.
One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
- The wedding.
- Which will be over soon.
- But our marriage?
- That lasts for ever.
Ah, well.
That works out nicely, then.
So, are you and Sam headed back to Central America?
Or is that classified?
Nepal.
- Sounds fun.
- Send you a postcard.
- Buffy - Riley By mission parameters, I'm done here.
But I have authorisation to take the Doctor out.
- Do you want me to do that?
- Do I want you to How can you ask me?
I'm sleeping with him.
I'm sleeping with Spike.
I had actually noticed that.
And then you come back Did you wait until your life was perfect and send that demon here, to throw it in my face?
Look You think this was easy for me?
Yeah.
I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun for the whole family.
I was terrified about seeing you again.
Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow for you.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Riley, please, don't patronise You want me to say I like seeing you with that idiot?
Or that blinding orange is your best colour?
Or that that burger smell is appealing?
- You smelled the smell?
- Buffy, none of that means anything.
It doesn't touch you.
You're still the first woman I ever loved and the strongest woman I've ever known.
Now, I'm not advertising this to the missis but you're still quite the hottie.
You know, it goes away after many bathings.
This isn't about who's on top.
I know how lucky I am right now.
I love my work and I love my wife.
I know.
And I kinda love her, too.
So you're not in the greatest place right now.
And maybe I made it worse.
No.
Wheel never stops turning, Buffy.
You're up, you're down It doesn't change what you are.
And you are a hell of a woman.
Riley, that night I never got the chance to tell you how sorry I was about what happened between us.
And you never have to.
The wedding itself was held in a chopper just before a night drop into hostile territory.
Huh.
And - just curious - what's a chopper rental run these days?
Well, actually, we commandeered it from a local guerrilla squad, so cheap.
Ah.
You have my email.
You'll keep in touch?
You won't get traced?
I don't wanna lead the bad guys to your location by mistake.
- Our line's secure.
- Oh.
Of course it is.
I keep thinking you're regular people, but no, you're not.
Oh, right!
Like demon hunting is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale.
So, you gonna say goodbye this time, or just split all secret-agenty, like last time?
Depends.
I warrant a hug?
Goodbye, Dawn.
Thought it would suck less this time.
It doesn't.
It was really nice meeting you all.
You ready for Nepal, Agent?
Fire fights, bug hunts, big body-counts Yeah, I could use a break.
Bye!
Bye, Riley.
Bye, Sam.
What a bitch!
So she's back.
Thought you'd be off snogging with soldier boy.
He's gone.
So you've come for a bit of cold comfort?
The bed's a bit blown up.
But that was never our I'm not here to And I'm not here to bust your chops about your stupid scheme either.
That's just you.
I should have remembered.
Oh, this is worse then, is it?
This is you tellin' me It's over.
I've memorised this tune, love.
Think I have the sheet music.
Doesn't change what you want.
I know that.
I do want you.
Being with you makes things simpler.
For a little while.
I don't call five hours straight a little while.
I'm using you.
I can't love you.
I'm just being weak and selfish.
Really not complaining here.
And it's killing me.
I have to be strong about this.
I'm sorry, William.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Previously: If I'd known you were comin', I'd have baked a cake.
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.
- Tell me you want me.
- I always want you.
Anya, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations!
Wedding, one week!
We have friends, family, demons flying in, a to-do list getting no shorter Can we not do this now?
I don't think this is gonna work.
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
Big wedding coming up.
You and Tara are speaking again.
- You wanna call her?
Invite her over?
- No.
Too soon for so bold a manoeuvre.
- It's over.
- I've memorised this tune, love.
I'm using you and it's killing me.
I'm sorry, William.
I know there's been a lot of loss.
People have a tendency to go away.
And sometimes I wish I could just make them stop.
Wish granted.
Buffy, it's hideous.
Oh, my God, Buffy.
Look at its arms!
I know.
But it's my duty.
I'm Buffy the bridesmaid.
Duty, schmuty.
I'm supposed to be best man.
Shouldn't I be all Marlene Dietrich-y in a dashing tuxedo number?
- No.
- Oh.
That would be unfair.
We must share equally in the cosmic joke that is bridesmaids-dom.
Well, maybe if I ask Anya, I can still go with the traditional blood larva and burlap.
She was a vengeance demon for, like, a thousand years.
She would know all the most flattering Iarvae.
What was she thinking?
She's probably too stressed to be thinking, what with Xander's relatives and her demons.
Oh, my God, last night, the rehearsal dinner.
It was like a zoo without the table manners.
And I bet it got worse after we left.
I can't believe everyone bought that story about Anya's people being circus folk.
Did you see the guy with the tentacles?
What's he?
Inky the Squid Boy?
And Xander's family.
I haven't seen them that bad since my Bat Mitzvah.
- Did you see how much they drank?
- Kinda.
Mr Harris threw up in my purse.
Oh!
Ohh.
You guys look so beautiful!
This is the happiest day of my whole life!
You seen my cuff links, Uncle Rory?
Metal deals, hold my sleeves together?
You don't want those.
What you really want is Velcro.
- Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?
-'Scuse me.
How you doin'?
Good.
Rory?
What you doin' there?
I'm tryin' to make myself an Irish coffee, but this stupid thing is on the fritz.
Watch it, it's still plugged in.
Gotcha.
Oh, is that broken?
You want me to take a look at that?
Knock yourself out there, Kevin.
Uh it's, uh, Krelvin.
Right.
Right.
Krelvin.
Whoo!
- Xander, you're not ready yet?
- Look at my hair.
It doesn't really matter cos I won't be in any of the pictures.
- You'll be in the pictures, Mom.
- I think your hair looks lovely.
- Oh.
- How's about some breakfast?
Oh, well, I guess if I'm a little plump it doesn't matter, cos I won't really be - You'll be in the pictures, Ma!
- That's one of hers, right?
Hey.
You're one of hers, right?
- You met Krelvin already, Dad.
Last night.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
We met.
You, um you said I resembled your mother-in-law.
- Tony!
- Oh, yeah.
And then you hit me with a cocktail wiener, and then you insulted my heritage.
Heritage?
Bein' circus folks is suddenly heritage now?
I mean no disrespect, of course.
I'm sure you come from a long, proud line of geeks.
- Kidding.
Just kidding.
- Xander?
Xander.
You know that guy Kevin?
If he could clear up the skin problem, do you think do you suppose he'd date a woman with a kid?
I mean, I really can't afford to be very picky.
Cousin Carol your earrings are my cuff links.
They are?
Oh, my.
Oops.
Excellent.
Cuff links - check.
We're rollin'.
Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
- Is it too small?
- Nah.
It fit when I picked up the tux.
How can it not fit now?
It'll fit.
Aw, man, what if it doesn't?
What if I can't wear my kummerbund, and the world can see my pants meet my shirt?
!
Buffy, that can not happen.
I must wear das kummerbund!
And so you shall!
- You got it!
- Slayer strength.
I've been meanin' to cut back on that habit-forming oxygen.
Look at you.
You look great, Mr About To Get Married.
Glowing.
Oh, my God!
Maybe you're pregnant!
Maybe.
I dunno.
Maybe I'm just happy.
Teary.
Oh!
Good.
Good teary.
Happy teary?
Not frustrated-with-bow-tie teary?
Yes.
Happy.
Happy for you.
That makes me happy for me.
You and Anya give me hope.
It's like you two are proof that there's light at the end of this very long, long, nasty tunnel.
And I cannot tie this tie.
Where's your best man?
Isn't she supposed to do this?
She said she had something to do.
- Want me to hold it shut for you?
- OK.
Are you guys even listening?
I need feedback, people.
- Sorry.
Please continue with the vows.
- OK.
"l, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honour you, but not to obey you, of course - that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, a sea captain"?
- "However, I do entrust you" - What?
Is something funny?
- No, nothing, sweetie.
Just keep still.
OK.
Blah, blah, blah, misogynistic.
Blah, blah "l do, however, entrust you um, with my heart".
"Take care of my heart, won't you, please"?
"Take care of it because it's all that I have".
"And, if you let me, I'll take care of your heart too".
"I'll protect it and tend to it, like a little stray".
Wait, no.
"Like a little mangy stray that needs a home".
- No, that's not it either.
- Um I think we're all set here.
Let's take a look at you.
Oh.
Wow.
You look lovely.
Really lovely.
Thanks.
It's probably the blush of imprudent spending.
Do you think Xander will like it?
Oh, I want to see Xander now!
You can't.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her dress, remember?
Right.
I can't keep all these ridiculous traditions straight.
What if I'm not wearing my dress when I see him?
OK, no sex.
Cuddling?
It's just I'm so excited and I want to share it with my best friend.
I get to be with my best friend for ever!
Yay!
- Guess who agreed to be my date for tonight.
- I'm really supposed to be working.
- I'm one of the caterers.
- Oh, hush.
No woman of mine is gonna work.
All you have to do is sit pretty, and laugh when I tell a good one.
Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie.
Gotta go.
Enjoy the wedding.
- Oh, bad head.
- What?
Well, the lip wasn't split right.
You gotta grab the lip between your thumb and your finger, and then you have to slice right through the centre of the meat.
It was my trade.
I used to stuff things.
I still do.
But only for fun.
- Ah.
Hymen's greetings.
- Hy what?
Hymen, the god of matrimony.
His salutations upon you.
May the love we celebrate today avoid an almost inevitable decline.
Cool.
I brought a gift.
I suppose there's a table.
Oh.
- Halfrek.
- Oh, please, call me Hallie!
- We're practically family now.
- Hm.
Neat.
I can put this on the table for you.
- Thank you.
Careful, it's - Fragile?
Squirmy.
So, Dawnie, how's everything?
Going good?
Nothing you, um, nothing you wish was different?
For Yekk's sake, take a day off.
We're not here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle.
Oh, look.
It's Katika Whatshername.
What has she done with?
- Spike!
- Oh.
I want you to meet my date.
- Hi.
I'm Dawn.
- Uh-huh.
So, yeah.
Anyway, that's my date.
She's with me.
My date for the wedding.
Yeah.
OK.
Well, nice meeting you.
So, circus folk.
What's that like?
Your friend - the fella with the warts - went off on his circus "heritage", like you folks are all in some kind of cult.
Well, there are ancient ways.
Clowning, as an occupation, grew out of the commedia dell'arte, and ancient sports, of course.
If you expect Xander to bring up his kids in a foreign-speaky bow-to-the-easty kinda cult You think children should be raised in ignorance of our ways?
No!
No, the Harrises are very broad-minded.
We're Episcopalians.
Oh.
"Till death do us part".
That's what cracks me up.
Hit me again, barkeep.
- How do I look?
- Well, let's see.
Found your shoes.
Your fly's zipped.
I'd say you look like you're ready to get married.
Aw.
You're one of the decent ones, Xander.
I hope I'm as lucky as you guys someday.
You wanna get lucky?
I've still got, what, 15, 20 minutes.
Oh!
All right.
Into the breach with you.
OK, breach me.
Now, let's go over the list one more time.
Number one?
- Don't let your dad near the bar.
- Check.
Number two?
- Don't let your mom near the bar.
- Check.
- Hey, Buffy.
Spike brought a total skank.
- A?
A Manic Panic freak he's macking with in the middle of the room.
- I saw him shove his tongue - Spike brought a date?
Yeah.
Wait till you see her.
Guys, I better go meet and greet.
Just go ahead.
I'll be a sec.
Hey, congratulations.
Congratulations, there, son.
- Hello, young man.
- Oh, Xander Alexander, do you realise that the usher sat us in the third row?
- I'm sure it was a mistake.
- I don't think - Excuse me.
- Do you know where the photographer is?
- I've got a proposition for him - I need to talk to you.
- Xander, one of Anya's presents got loose!
- Got loose?
It's a fully alive squiggly thingy - and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?
Please, please, you have to You have to listen to me!
You can't get married today.
It's a huge mistake.
Yeah, right.
Thanks for the advice, Uncle Help me here.
- Uncle?
You don't recognise me, do you?
- I'm sorry, I don't This sounds crazy, I know but you have to believe me.
I'm Xander Harris.
I'm you.
- What do you mean, you're me?
- I'm you.
I'm you from the future.
Oh, from the future!
I thought you were a nutball, but now that you're from the future Please listen to me.
I found my way back to warn you, to tell you - Hey, easy.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Toast!
- I told that guy no drinks before the service.
- Toast!
A toast to the Harris clan.
- Look.
Look!
I can prove it to you.
- I know we've had problems I thought you might need convincing.
- Anya's crew make mine look good.
- Come on.
Follow me.
And to my wife, Jessica.
Where are you, honey?
There she is.
To my wife.
What would I do without you, beautiful?
Well, for starters, I probably wouldn't need to drink so much, would l?
On the brighter side, marriage has probably saved me from a nasty dose of the clap.
Here's to ya.
- Does this jerk ever shut up?
- He's startin' to make my suckers twitch.
And a toast to the bride's dermatologically-challenged family shrub.
- Sit down!
- Hey, I paid for all this!
You want me to sit down, you cough up a couple of grand, Squidly.
What'd you call me, you drunken piece of sh?
- Mazel tov!
- Hey!
What's this?
You must be so happy for Xander on his very special, once-in-a-lifetime day, Mr Harris.
Nice chassis.
What's under the hood?
Rrr!
You know, I could use a strong cup of coffee.
Hey, let's get you one too.
What do you say?
- Did you own a little square pinkish purse?
- I did.
I thought so.
What do you say we slip in the back room and I show you my You finish that sentence and I guarantee you won't have anything to show.
Ooh.
- What is it?
- It's magic.
Very powerful.
Look at it.
You'll see what I've seen.
Feel what I've felt.
Anya.
Anya!
Get the hell away from me!
Dad, Josh is teasing me.
Sara's a weirdo!
Sara's a weirdo!
What?
You goin' out again?
- I'm doing a makeover party.
- I thought you hated those.
Well, one of us has to make some money.
Well, what do you want me to do?
I can't work.
My back's shot.
- And whose fault is that?
- Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Buffy thing again.
You had no business fighting demons with her.
Buffy needed me.
I had to help.
Well, it didn't save her, did it?
All it did was ruin our lives.
I'll be late.
I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
- What?
- I hate this place.
- You know I don't eat wheat.
- You don't eat anything, freak.
- At least I'm not a mama's boy.
- At least I'm not a freak.
- Dad, make him cut it!
- You should talk to your mother about that.
You've had too much wine.
Have l?
I'm just saying maybe you should talk to your daughter!
Ohh, I hate you guys!
I know that you're not my real dad, and I hate you.
I hate you both.
I wish you'd die!
This sucks.
If you were so unhappy, why didn't you leave?
I wanted to.
I should have!
Yeah.
Maybe I would have gotten some touch in the past 20 years.
- I wasn't the one who stopped touching!
- Oh!
Maybe, but you weren't touchin' me!
What did you expect me to do?
You wouldn't come near me after Buffy - Don't bring her into this!
- Fine.
Forget her.
Maybe you were just born to be a bitter, angry old man.
- Shut up.
- No!
I want my life back!
If I hadn't married you I wouldn't have had to hate myself for the last 30 years!
Shut up!
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't want to show you.
- What happened?
What was that?
A glimpse of your future, harnessed by magic.
Is she OK?
Is she OK?
What did I do?
!
Listen.
I don't have long here.
The spell that brought me back, it won't last.
But you can change things.
It doesn't have to go like this.
- But you can't marry Anya.
- But You'll hurt her less today than you will later.
Believe me.
Sometimes, two people all they bring each other is pain.
Hello, Buffy.
Hey.
It's a happy occasion.
You meet my friend?
No.
Not yet.
But she seems like a very nice attempt at making me jealous.
Is it working?
A little.
It doesn't change anything but if you're wildly curious yeah, it hurts.
I'm sorry.
Or good!
- You want us to go?
- No.
No, l you have every right to be here.
I pretty much deserve That's not true.
You God, this is hard.
Yeah.
I think we'll go.
Go where?
Your place?
Yeah, I suppose.
- That was the idea.
- Yeah.
- Evil.
- Of course.
But I won't or, uh I'll just go.
Give my best to whatever the happy couple.
I will.
It's nice to watch you be happy.
For them, even.
I don't see it a lot.
You, uh you glow.
That's because the dress is radioactive.
- I should - Yeah.
But it hurts?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
- Let's go.
- What about the wedding?
Let's just piss off, all right?
I'll say this for the Y-chromosome looks good in a tux.
Well, your double Xs don't look too bad there, either.
You're getting married.
My little Xander.
All growed up.
It's a good thing I realised I was gay, otherwise, hey, you, me and formalwear - Do you know how much I love you?
- Mmm About half as much as I love you.
You ready for the long walk?
Um Just give me a sec.
I wanna work on my vows.
Take your time.
It's not like we can start the wedding without you.
"l, Anya, promise to cherish you" Ew, no, not cherish.
Um "l promise to have sex with you whenever I want, and, uh uh, pledge to be your friend, your wife, and your confidante, - and your sex poodle" - Sex poodle?
Yeah.
Why?
I'm not sure you should say "sex poodle" in your vows.
Huh.
The music.
They're playing the music!
This is it.
Are you ready to go?
He's gone.
Xander disappeared.
What?
Xander's gone?
What should we do?
I'm gonna go look for him.
I'm gonna find him.
And you're gonna stall.
Sorry about that.
There's just gonna be a little bit of a delay.
- Why?
What's wrong?
- Nothing!
Nothing's wrong, it's just, um it's the minister.
He had to go and perform an emergency C-section.
- C-section?
- Yeah!
You know, he's not just a minister, he's also a doctor.
He's half-minister, half-doctor.
He's a mini-tor.
Not to be confused with a Minotaur, because he's all man, this doctor-minister man - no bull parts whatsoever.
Uh-huh.
So it should just be a couple of minutes.
OK.
OK.
For the last time.
"l, Anya, want to marry you, Xander, because I love you and I'll always love you".
"And before I knew you, I was, like, a completely different person".
"Not even a person, really".
"And I had seen what love could do to people, and it was hurt and sadness.
" "Alone was better.
" "And then, suddenly, there was you, and you knew me.
" "You saw me, and it was this thing.
" "You make me feel safe and warm.
" "So, l get it now".
"l finally get love, Xander".
"l really do".
- I'm bored.
- It's a wedding, honey.
We're all bored.
No!
No, it's, uh It's not what you think.
Beautiful.
What's going on?
I mean, I am sorry, but what the hell was that minister thinking?
- Uh, I don't know.
He - Delivering a baby on my special day.
It's totally rude of him - and the mother.
Why couldn't he have just told her to hold it?
Give me a double Jack.
This is a disaster.
It's that Anya.
I know it.
She made us pay for the whole thing and now she's gonna louse it up.
Women!
I offered to help.
She didn't want my help.
This totally isn't happening.
We should've known she'd never I am worried about Anya.
Oh, sure.
Of course you are.
Oh, Halfrek.
You know I love all my demons equally.
Buffy, you've gotta do something.
So who here's from out of town?
My family is worse.
No way.
Mine is so messed up you have no idea.
Wait until you see my mom dance at the reception and then tell me who's messed up.
- I guess they're all messed up.
- Yeah.
Everybody's pretty lame.
- First word!
- One word!
- Animal?
- Animal?
Bull!
- Anya, wait up!
- This bride waits for no one.
If the minister's not here yet, we just have to get married without a minister.
Jeez.
What is the hold-up?
Can you keep a secret?
Nobody knows this, but the groom, he took off and no one can find him.
- What?
- Um - I'll catch you later, Dawn.
- Xander's gone?
Xander's missing?
What do you mean, Xander's missing?
!
It's a joke.
Xander's playing a joke.
It's like one time, at one of Carol's weddings, I had this ape suit Oh, great.
Another Harris family joke.
Why don't you have another drink?
Drinking is the only way I can dull the pain of looking at your ugly face.
Think real hard about this, Harris.
Don't touch me with those nasty circus things!
That's it!
Thanks.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Xander?
Have you seen Xander?
Has anyone seen Xander?
Well, I saw him go into the trophy room with that guy!
You.
You were talking to Xander right before he left.
What did he say to you?
- What did you say to him?
- Doesn't matter now, does it?
It's done.
What's done?
Did you?
If you said something to make him leave You'll what?
Haven't changed a bit.
Still as vindictive as ever.
Do I know you?
You don't recognise me, Anya?
I'm not the man I used to be.
I know.
Guys!
Will you break it up?
!
Xander.
Where is he?
You tell me, old man!
- You tell me why he left!
- He left because of you.
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, really?
What about this?
Tell me what you did with Xander.
What are you?
!
You did this.
You brought this on.
I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka.
- Who are you?
- Remember Chicago?
South Side, 1914?
Stewart Burns, philanderer!
You'd think you'd remember.
I remember you.
But you ruined my life.
You were a - I punished you.
- That's right.
Some hussy I'd been taking around summons you.
Next thing I know, I look like this and I'm being tortured in another dimension.
- I forgot.
- Well, I didn't!
Anya!
Every day I remembered and every day I thought how I would get here, and ruin your life like you ruined mine.
It didn't take much, either.
I scared off your fiancé with a couple of phoney visions.
Visions of what?
Your future.
Or his nightmare vision of your future.
- That's it?
That's all you did?
- Yeah.
It was easy.
Look at that, you're crying.
Oh, I like that.
- Stop it.
- Oh, cry, Anyanka, cry.
I love to see you cry.
And now I'd love to see you scream.
Come any closer and I'll kill her.
- Anya!
- Xander!
I'm I'm so glad you're here.
It was all lies, what he showed you.
It wasn't true, he just wanted to break us up.
- It doesn't matter now.
- So we'll be OK?
Excuse me.
- It's dead.
- Yup.
Is anyone else waiting for it to go poof?
Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
Look at this damage.
I'm not payin' for this, you freaks!
Stop calling us freaks!
Oh, no, no!
No, not again!
No!
Stop it!
Everyone sit down!
This wedding will go on, so get back in your seats!
You know, it's bad luck to see me in my dress.
Hey.
It's OK.
It's all over now.
He's dead, and it was just smoke and mirrors.
I know.
So - we're ready now.
Let's get married.
- l I-l I'm not I'm not ready.
I can't, An, I'm sorry.
But it wasn't real.
What he showed you, it wasn't real.
I know it wasn't real.
But it could be.
What was it?
Was it about me?
Cos he wanted you to hate me, Xander.
It wasn't you.
It wasn't you I was hating.
I had these thoughts and fears before this.
- Maybe we just went too fast.
- Look, everybody has thoughts.
It's natural, it doesn't mean getting married is wrong.
- I know, I know.
- Look, you're just shaken up, OK?
You just calm down and we'll start over, OK?
We can't start over.
If this is a mistake, it's for ever.
And I don't wanna hurt you.
Not that way.
I'm sorry.
- But - I am so sorry.
Should we do something for her?
Anything?
She wants to be alone.
That's what she wants.
Oh, God, it just hurts my heart to think of her.
I know.
The whole thing hurts my heart.
- I thought they were happy.
- They were.
I know they were.
They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel.
I guess they were a train.
Why did this happen?
I don't know.
I feel like I should be hating Xander.
But I can't.
I just I just hope he's OK.
I wonder where he is.
Not much to explain.
Air conditioner's busted.
That's it.
Checkout's at 11.
Are you OK?
I'm tired of crying.
I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn.
Oh, Anyanka.
I'm sorry.
But you let him domesticate you.
When you were a vengeance demon, you were powerful.
At the top of your game, you crushed men like him.
It's time you got back to what you do best, don't you think?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": So, anything new about Warren and the nerd herd?
A nerd goes into hiding, he really hides.
Big wedding coming up, lots of date possibilities, you and Tara are speaking again.
You wanna call her?
No.
But if I did call she wouldn't hang up on me.
You can't even stand to be around me.
- That is not true.
- You didn't wanna come back.
- It's over.
- I've memorised this tune, love.
I'm using you and it's killing me.
I'm sorry, William.
This is it.
Are you ready to go?
He's gone.
Xander's gone?
Xander's missing?
What do you mean Xander's missing?
!
- Oh, man, your face was priceless.
- Yeah, real funny.
Serves you right for taking zees on lookout again.
What do you expect?
I haven't had a decent night's sleep since I'm going Jack Torrance in here, you know?
Stuck in this basement for weeks!
We rented the whole house.
Can't we sleep upstairs?
We're on the lam.
We have to lay low.
Underground?
It's figurative, doofus!
Did you even read Legion of Doom?
Enough!
Midgetor, back to the monitors.
- The last thing we need is to be surprised - Holy Jeez Louise.
- The - The fricking Slayer.
- She's right there!
- All right, don't panic.
Andrew.
Deploy your little friend.
Oh.
Hi.
You didn't by chance happen to eat a couple of nerds?
- You're gonna hurt yourself!
- She'll break the needle.
We're gonna have to strap her down.
Hi, um, Tara.
How are you?
Hey, I was wondering, maybe, you would wanna go out sometime?
For coffee, food, kisses and gay love?
Hi, Tara.
Guess what?
Magic-free now for - insert number - days now.
Buffy.
Buffy.
Come on.
It's time for your drugs.
What?
I said, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were on drugs.
OK.
Good.
- Whatcha doin'?
- I'm online, checkin' to see if Xander emailed.
- Any luck?
- No such.
Well, maybe Anya found him and they're trying to work it out.
How come you're all home, hearth and DSL?
- I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- Saw her.
Saw her completely.
Ouch.
Just got a scratch from all that brittle.
It's When I was seeing her, she was seeing someone else.
A girl.
- You mean - I mean not "seeing" seeing.
Well, maybe.
I don't know, it was inconclusive, and I didn't stick around to find out.
I might have magicked my fist through a wall or something.
Will, I'm sorry.
I mean, they're probably just friends.
I press my lips against my friends all the time.
I'm sure they're just friends.
Once you fall for Willow, you stay fallen.
Thanks, Buffy.
- Hi.
I'm back.
- Xander?
Xander, you're here!
- We missed you!
Where were you?
- I know.
- I tried calling, but I couldn't without - Hey.
You don't need to explain to us.
Right.
Is she here?
Oh.
No.
You wanna find her?
I need to.
Her suitcase is gone, and some of her stuff.
There's a "closed" sign on the Magic Box, which, like, chills me to the bone.
She left a couple of days ago.
Was she looking for me?
Before she left, did she say anything?
You mean, between sobs?
There was mostly just wheezing.
She was a little She was kinda broken.
I don't know how stuff got so mixed up.
- I blew it.
- No.
Well maybe it wasn't the best time to break up with her, but No.
It wasn't about breaking up.
I love her and, God, I miss her so much.
So, you left her at the altar, but you still wanna - You still wanna date?
- I guess.
I know that I'm a better person with her in my life.
But things got so complicated, with the wedding, my family, her demons and what if it all goes to Hell, and for ever?
But then I left.
And ever since I've had this painful hole inside.
And I'm the idiot that dug it out.
- I screwed up real bad.
- Hey.
We all screw up.
You lookin' for me?
Really not.
Oh.
Right then.
Off you go.
- Did you cry?
- What?
The wedding.
Two hearts joined for eternity, great pelting showers of rice and so forth.
You didn't hear.
What?
Families get out of hand?
- Tear the place apart?
- No.
Well, yes, absolutely, but Xander left.
The wedding didn't happen.
Well, gotta say I didn't see that coming.
It was awful.
Anya was devastated.
Is that right?
And Xander thinks maybe they can still get back together, but he hurt her a lot.
Yeah, well some people can't see a good thing when they've got it.
- Spike.
- I should've known you'd be tagging along.
Hey, guys.
I found Spike and was, uh tryin' to figure out what kind of dangerous contraband he had.
Tell you what, Slayer.
Let me get out of your way.
I'll stop bothering you.
Yeah, maybe you should do that, Spike - just run along.
I guess you know all about that, don't you?
The king of the big exit.
Heard it brought the house down.
- I don't need this crap from you.
- Right.
Let's not listen to Spike.
- Might get a bit of truth on you.
- OK, OK.
Calm now.
Let's turn around and release this very manly thing the other way.
I forgot.
Willy Wannabite can't hurt me.
Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
More than happy to beat you right through the pain, you pathetic poof.
- Guys, don't.
- Buffy, can you hear me?
- What is this?
- Do you know where you are, Buffy?
- Sunnydale.
- No, none of that's real, none of it.
You're in a mental institution.
You've been with us now for six years.
Do you remember?
- Buffy?
Are you OK?
- What happened?
It's OK, Buffy.
Buffy, it's OK.
Look.
Look who's here.
Buffy?
Welcome home, sweetie.
Mom?
- Oh, baby, you're really here.
- Dad?
She's lucid.
Keep talking.
Maybe the sound of your voice will ground her.
Sweetheart?
We've missed you very much.
Honey, can you hear me?
- Buffy, stay with us, please.
- Oh No!
- Here, let's get her back to my crypt.
- Spike, just go, OK?
She's our friend.
We'll take care of her.
No, guys, I'm OK.
I'm OK.
Come on, Xander.
Help me get her home.
Put a little ice on the back of her neck.
She likes that.
I've been having these flashes.
Hallucinations, I guess.
- Since when?
- Uh night before last.
I was checking houses on that list you gave me, looking for Warren and his pals, and then bam!
Some kind of gross, waxy demon thing poked me.
- And when you say poke - In the arm.
It stung me or something, and then I was like No.
It wasn't "like".
I was in an institution.
There were doctors and nurses and other patients.
They told me that I was sick.
I guess crazy.
And that Sunnydale and all of this None of it was real.
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous!
What?
You think this isn't real just because of all the vampires and demons and ex-vengeance demons and the sister that was a big ball of universe-destroying energy?
I know how this must sound, but it felt so real.
- Mom was there.
- She was?
Dad too.
They were together, like they used to be before Sunnydale.
OK!
All in favour of research?
Motion passed.
All right, Xander, you hit the demon bars.
Dig up any info on a new player in town.
Dawnie, help me research.
We'll hop online, check all the ..
possibilities for a full recovery, but we have to proceed cautiously.
- If we're not careful - Wait.
Are you saying that Buffy could be like she was before any of this happened?
Mrs Summers, you have to understand the severity of what's happened to your daughter.
For the last six years, she's been in an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia.
We know what her condition is.
That's not what we're asking.
Buffy's delusion is multilayered.
She believes she's some type of hero.
- The Slayer.
- The Slayer, right, but that's only one level.
She's also created an intricate latticework to support her primary delusion.
In her mind, she's the central figure in a fantastic world beyond imagination.
She's surrounded herself with friends, most with their own superpowers, who are as real to her as you or me - more so, unfortunately.
Together they face grand, overblown conflicts against an assortment of monsters, both imaginary and rooted in actual myth.
Every time we think we're getting through to her, - more fanciful enemies magically appear - How did I miss?
Warren and Jonathan, they did this to me!
- Buffy!
- Buffy, it's all right.
They can't hurt you here.
You're with your family.
- Dawn?
- That's the sister, right?
The magical key.
Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion, actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate a need for a familial bond.
Buffy, but that created inconsistencies, didn't it?
Your sister, your friends, all of those people you created in Sunnydale, they aren't as comforting as they once were.
Are they?
They're coming apart.
Buffy, listen to what the doctor says.
It's important.
Buffy, you used to create these grand villains to battle against, and now what is it?
Just ordinary students you went to high school with.
No gods or monsters.
Just three pathetic little men who like playing with toys.
- Dude, that poison's got her drooling like - Where have you guys been?
Uh pickin' up some stuff.
And checking out Buffy on the van's remote surveillance.
Andrew's demon pet has done some number on the Slayer.
Got her trippin' like a Ken Russell film festival.
- Well, what kind of stuff?
- What?
The packages.
What's in them?
- Do you think we're plotting against you?
- Better not be.
It's just stuff, big man.
You'll be in the know just as soon as you stop being all freakazoid.
There's the vault.
I still say we'll need eight other guys to pull this off.
I never should have let you see that movie.
- Where you going?
- Out.
Getting stuff I need.
- I don't really think that's such a good idea.
- Why not?
Well, it's It's just not safe out there alone.
You saw how close the Slayer got.
Look, we're a team.
Something happens to you, it happens to all of us.
Right?
Look, I know you're antsy.
We all are.
But, you see, things are about to pick up.
Big-time.
Just gotta be careful.
Right?
All right?
Stick together.
OK?
Look, Buffy, I found the demon.
Fits your description and symptoms perfectly.
Look, is this it?
See?
It's gonna be OK.
Its pokey stinger carries an antidote to its own poison.
I feel so lost.
I know.
You're confused.
- It's that crazy juice inside you.
- It's more than that.
Even before the demon I've been so detached.
We've all been kinda slummin'.
Every day I try to snap out of it.
Figure out why I'm like that.
Buffy, look at me.
You are not in an institution.
You have never been in an institution.
Yes, I have.
What?
Back when I saw my first vampires I got so scared, I told my parents and they completely freaked out.
They thought there was something seriously wrong with me.
So they sent me to a clinic.
You never said anything.
I was only there a couple of weeks.
I stopped talking about it and they let me go.
Eventually my parents just forgot.
God.
That's horrible.
What if I'm still there?
What if I never left that clinic?
Buffy Buffy, you're not.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
But it's the past.
You've gotta trust me.
We're gonna get you that antidote.
Xander's hunting the demon right now.
Alone?
Willow, he can't.
It's too strong.
Oh, it's OK.
We got help.
So she's havin' the wiggins, is she?
Thinks none of us are real.
Bloody self-centred, if you ask me.
Spike, we need muscle, not colour commentary.
On the other hand, it might explain some things - this all being in that twisted brain of hers.
Yeah.
Fix up some chip in my head.
Make me soft, fall in love with her, then turn me into her sodding sex slave - What?
!
- Nothing.
Alternative realities.
Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny-farm delusion.
Where you might not have left your bride at the altar - and gone through with it like a man.
- One more syllable about Anya Oh, balls.
You didn't say he was a glarghk guhl kashmas'nik!
Cos I can't say glargh I altered his reality.
Get it?
I Never mind.
I made you some tea.
Thanks.
I'm OK, Dawn.
The thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.
You're burning up.
- I should be taller than you.
- Maybe you're not done growing.
- Coming apart.
- What's coming apart?
- We have to try harder, make things better.
- I'm trying.
Your grades.
Stealing.
Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
What?
No, it's it's the fever.
It's cooking your brain.
- We have to deal with these things - You don't have a sister, Buffy.
- Dawn?
- No, honey.
Say it.
It'll help you believe it.
I don't have a sister.
I know.
I didn't grow up with her.
These monks they made her.
It's your mind just playing tricks on you.
You're our little girl, Buffy.
Our one and only.
We have missed you so much.
Mom and Dad just want to take you home and take care of you.
I'm not even there, am l?
What?
You said it a second ago.
You don't have a sister.
It's your ideal reality, and I'm not even a part of it.
- Dawn, l didn't mean - I have to go finish my chores.
Hold it.
- Hold it.
- I'll need its arm.
Yeah, I'd like both my arms, too.
Thanks, Spike.
I'll help when the blistering pain subsides.
Ready?
Xander, go to the magic shop.
I'll need alkanet root and a handful of nettle leaf.
Just for the medicinal properties.
No magic.
Then meet me at the campus lab.
I'll try to brew up an antidote the old-fashioned way.
I'll hold here, keep an eye on the wax job.
- Make sure that's all you're ogling.
- Xander!
Buffy?
Wake up.
Got yummy antidote goodness for you.
What happened?
It took a little longer than I'd hoped.
No magic and all.
Went boom twice, but then I got it.
Just when it's cool, drink it all down, and everything should go back to normal.
You never stop coming through.
Thank you, Willow.
- How is she?
- Make sure she drinks all that.
I'm gonna let Dawn know that everything's gonna be OK.
You all right?
You need to leave me alone.
You're not part of my life.
Fine, then.
But I hope you don't think this an I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom.
See, I figured it out, love.
You can't help yourself.
You're not drawn to the dark like I thought.
You're addicted to the misery.
It's why you won't tell your pals about us.
Might actually have to be happy if you did.
They'd either understand and help you, God forbid, or drive you out, where you could finally be at peace.
In the dark.
With me.
Either way, you'd be better off for it, but you're too twisted for that.
Let yourself live, already.
And stop with the bloody hero trip for a sec.
We'd all be the better for it.
You either tell your friends about us or I will.
Buffy?
I don't wanna go back there.
I wanna be healthy again.
What do I have to do?
Oh, please, help me.
I wanna go home with you and Dad.
I know, Buffy.
But first you've gotta get better.
It's not gonna be easy, Buffy.
You have to take it one step at a time.
You have to start ridding your mind of those things that support your hallucinations.
You understand?
There are things in that world you cling to.
For your delusion, they're safe-holds, but for your mind they're traps.
We have to break those down.
- Slaying?
- Yes.
But I'm talking about those things you want there.
What keeps you going back.
- My friends.
- That's right.
Last summer, when you had a momentary awakening, - it was them that pulled you back in.
- They're not really your friends, Buffy.
They're just tricks keeping you from getting healthy.
You have to do whatever it takes to convince yourself of that, Buffy.
Whatever it takes.
Oh, Buffy, I didn't see you.
I was just coming to check on you.
You feeling better?
Did the antidote work?
I'm still pretty dazed, but better.
No more cuckoo's nest?
We still have the big bad tranked out in the basement In case it didn't work and we need more parts.
It'll be nice to see you all better.
Thanks.
I can make you some food, something big with energy, help you clear your noggin.
Come on.
Hello!
I'm back!
Clean and with the better smell now.
Friends?
Romans?
Anyone?
Hey.
Hey there, sane girl.
So did Willow get that antidote to you all right?
Yeah.
I'm better now.
Great.
So it's settled.
We're real, right?
Let's finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement.
And tell me you're up for that.
I so don't wanna see Spike right now.
I mean, talk about losing touch.
Hate to say it, but I almost feel sorry for the guy.
Almost.
The things the poor guy was saying I get it, you know.
Been a part of the Buffy obsess Buffy Willow, what?
Dawn?
Don't you knock?
I called for you.
Buffy, are you OK?
Where are you going?
I'm going over to Janice's, where they actually like having me around.
You're not going anywhere.
Why not?
You want me gone anyway.
- What do you care?
- I care.
You're going downstairs with the others.
It's the only way I can get healthy.
What are you talking about?
Buffy, you look sick.
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
Stay away from me!
Willow, help!
Buffy, please!
You can't hide, Dawn.
Talk to me.
You're hallucinating.
I know.
You're just a trap for my mind.
Buffy, please, listen to me.
That asylum and those people, they're not real!
Buffy look at me.
I'm right here.
You're my sister.
I need you and love you.
Somewhere inside you must know that's real.
Sure it is!
Cos what's more real?
A sick girl in an institution Don't.
Please, listen to me.
..
or some kind of supergirl chosen to fight demons and save the world?
That's ridiculous.
- A girl who sleeps with a vampire she hates?
Yeah, that makes sense!
No!
Buffy, stop!
I'm real!
Buffy, stop it.
I'll be good!
I promise.
You're not thinking.
I'll It's OK, Buffy.
Don't stress yourself.
Honey, take your time.
Make it as easy on yourself as possible.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Buffy what are you doin'?
Oh, my God.
Buffy, help me!
I need my hands!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Buffy?
It's gonna be OK, sweetheart.
Whatever it is, it's not real, remember?
Just keep concentrating.
I'm right here, sweetie.
Buffy, help me!
Buffy, help!
Willow?
Eximete!
Vis Zenobia!
Solvere!
No!
Tara!
- I don't know - Buffy, look at me.
- I don't know.
I don't know.
- I believe in you.
You're a survivor.
You can do this.
Xander.
No.
- Willow!
- Buffy?
Buffy!
Buffy, fight it.
You're too good to give in.
You can beat this thing.
Be strong, baby, OK?
I know you're afraid.
I know the world feels like a hard place sometimes, but you've got people who love you.
Your dad and l, we have all the faith in the world in you.
We'll always be with you.
You've got a world of strength in your heart.
I know you do.
You just have to find it again.
Believe in yourself.
You're right.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Buffy.
I'm so sorry.
- Buffy?
- We're OK.
It's all OK.
Buffy, sit down.
You'll fall over.
No.
I can't.
- Not until I have the antidote.
- OK.
We'll make more.
We'll take care of it.
Everything's gonna be OK, Buffy.
I'm sorry, there's no reaction at all.
I'm afraid we lost her.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- Previously: - I'm using you.
- This is you telling me - It's over.
- Where have you guys been?
- Watching Buffy on the remote surveillance.
- I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- She was seeing someone else.
Xander's gone?
Xander's missing?
- Is she here?
- She left a couple of days ago.
She was kinda broken.
I love her and, God, I miss her so much.
No!
How could you do this?
Buffy, stop!
No!
- I'm so sorry.
- We're OK.
It's all OK.
Aha!
- They're getting to the gate!
- Yeah, I see it, I see it!
We're gonna lose'em.
We need that disc.
Wait.
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, fine.
You know, same old, same old.
Yeah.
I could take care of this guy if you want.
Whatever.
Your call.
I mean, sure, he don't look like much, but I'd wager he could give you a bit o' nasty.
Save you the staking.
All you gotta do is I am not telling my friends about us.
Right, I'll just be droppin' him down to you, then.
You wanna tell'em so badly?
Go ahead.
You know why?
I tried to kill my friends, my sister last week, and guess how much they hate me.
Zero.
Zero much.
So I'm thinkin', sleeping with you they'll deal.
In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?
Huh?
Because I don't love you.
Like hell.
Hey!
Hey.
Look at you.
All comin' out of class and everything.
I do that sometimes.
Usually at the end part of the class.
Right.
So how's your after the whole basement deal?
It's between a hitch and a kink with a side of a twinge.
It's OK.
And Buffy's OK too?
Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth?
Ha, yeah!
Refreshing sa That's funny.
She's OK.
A little freaked.
- I'm glad she didn't hurt you.
- You, too.
So, this is becoming kind of a regular thing, you and me after class.
Uh I didn't Only this time you stuck around.
Uh Um Various sounds of hesitation She was just a friend.
Friends are nice!
You rushed off before I could, you know, explain.
Well, officially, I have to say I have no idea what you're talking about.
Unofficially?
We should have some coffee sometime.
Maybe some day this week after class?
- I'm free tomorrow.
- You could bring your friend.
I wasn't gonna I mean, if you have a friend No!
I'm I'm friendless.
Yeah, yeah, no friends.
I mean, I have friends.
Right, many dear friends, yeah.
- Coffee.
- With us.
Who are just friends.
OK, how about this store?
Ah!
Three pairs of earrings, a coin purse and a toothbrush.
You stole a toothbrush?
- A mother-of-pearl handle.
Very fancy.
- Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush.
As far as rebellious teenagers go, you're square.
Dental hygiene is important.
Guess this was kind of a lame sisters' day out, huh?
I make up for trying to kill you by taking you to places you can't go in.
No, it's my bad.
I'm the one that got caught takin' stuff.
The pet store.
You didn't take anything from there, did ya?
A pocketful of goldfish.
It didn't work out.
No!
OK, good.
We can go look at all the puppies.
Oh But it's so awful!
There's puppy mills, and keeping them in cages, and people poking at'em all day.
Yeah, but puppies - cute!
Come on, you used to love the pet store.
Yes, when I was in my fives and sixes.
Come on, we'll go look.
Besides, I don't think there's another store here where I can show my face.
It'll pass.
You've returned all the stuff you still had, and we're paying for the rest.
- I'm paying for the rest.
- We'll figure it out.
Get back!
You don't wanna make me rush this.
I'm not impressed, Padawan.
When do we hit pay dirt?
If something goes wrong, it's gonna surge.
We'll be deader than an ex-girlfriend.
- What did you say?
- Just let me work!
All right.
You do what you need to do.
You get us the goods, and then watch out!
It'll be like the whole world just spread open and gave it up for you, man.
And then we're done, right?
We each take our share and we call it a day.
You're that ready to get rid of us?
Huh?
Don't worry.
We pull this off, you can go buy any tropical island you want.
Cheer up, Short Round.
You're about to get us everything we ever wanted.
- He's almost done.
- I sorta feel kinda sorry for him.
- That's a weakness.
- OK.
Hm Look at him.
He's got that same look he had that time I highlighted in his Babylon 5 novels.
Right before he told his mom on me!
Warren, I don't think we can trust him.
We don't have to.
Not for that much longer.
Is it gonna be that soon?
The milk in the fridge.
How long till it expires?
Well, we got it on Friday, and there wasn't a full two weeks on it, but we did get it in the fridge quick.
Unless I'm thinking about the 2% milk Forget it.
The thing.
It's gonna be soon.
Oh.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
- How are you?
- Ducky.
You?
An Please Let me explain.
I know there's nothing that I can say or do to make up for what I did.
I can't.
Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I'm, like, "Oh, God!
Is this my life"?
- "Was that me"?
- Me, too.
But you gotta believe me, please.
I want to make up for it.
I wanna take away the hurt.
I love you so much.
I may have practised that a couple times in front of the mirror.
I just I don't understand what happened.
I do.
I'm an idiot.
All I had to do was say something earlier.
I could have spared you from that that nightmare.
Said something about what?
No, no!
I mean you know, if I were, like, more self-aware.
Because with the whole idiot thing.
If you had been more self-aware, you would have what?
- Been able to stop the wedding?
- No, it's not like that.
That's not what OK, see, I didn't practise this part.
Do you still want to get married?
Oh.
An, it's a very complicated question.
No, actually, it's really not.
It's kind of an either-or deal.
Do you want to get married?
Someday, yes, very much.
When we're ready.
I don't want you to take this as a bad thing.
It's good.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I'm just trying to be honest with you.
Yes.
Honesty now.
Congratulations, Xander, on being honest now.
I wonder what the medal will say.
- OK, clearly I'm not handling this well.
- Well, duh!
All I want is for us to be together.
I love you.
I wish we could just go back to the way things were before.
And I wish you were never born!
I know this is all coming out wrong.
I wish you felt the pain of a thousand searing pokers boiling your heart in its own juices!
I know, honey.
I totally deserve that.
I I wish you had tentacles where your beady eyes should be!
I wish your intestines were tied in knots and ripped apart inside your lousy gut!
- They are.
- Really?
- Right now?
Does it hurt?
- God, yes.
It hurts so bad it's killin' me.
Anya, I love you.
I wanna make this work.
Those are metaphor intestines!
You're not in any real pain!
- What's wrong with me?
- No, honey, it's not you.
It's me Oh!
An!
An!
Wait, please!
An!
So there was no child support in, like, So now, every time he touches a paper that isn't a cheque for the child, paper cuts.
You know how I hate to toot my own horn, but now his hands are just covered in all these tiny little bandages.
Like a quilt.
- You know, made of bandages.
- Hm?
OK.
Do they not teach listening skills in human world?
Sorry.
I know.
I'm just distracted.
About Xander?
Don't worry, you'll figure out a way to That's just it.
I've tried everything, every curse I knew.
Nothing's worked.
- Wait.
Did you try to curse him yourself?
- I am the wronged party.
Of course You can't exact justice against someone on behalf of yourself, silly!
How long you been away?
I haven't been scorned by a man in, like, a thousand years.
I never had to make a wish for myself.
There has to be some way around that.
Well You could try getting someone to make the wish for you I suppose.
Uh Did we open a chain?
Are we the International House or something?
Nope.
It felt like a breakfast kind of morning.
- What kind of syrup on your pancakes?
- Syrups have kinds?
Oh!
I was thinking, after the mall yesterday, maybe we shouldn't go out tonight.
Maybe we could stay in and - ow!
- you know, get a pizza or rent a movie?
Also, I didn't know if you had plans, but I thought maybe we could Hey, Buffy?
I'm gonna be OK with the basement thing.
Really.
- You weren't you.
- This isn't guilt.
- I want us to spend time.
- OK.
Good.
I love spending time - But I'm cramping your teenage style.
- No.
Yes, I am.
I'm the embarrassing mom who tries too hard.
When did this happen?
No, you're not.
It's not that.
It's just What if, instead of you hanging out with me, maybe I could hang out with you?
Why don't I come patrolling with you?
Oh.
And then we can invite over some strangers and ask them to feed you candy.
Well, you guys went out patrolling every night at my age.
True but technically you're one-and-a-half.
See, I thought a little levity might but OK.
Also no.
I just I just think I could help.
I'm sure you could.
But it's a little more dangerous than I had in mind.
But Dawn, I work very hard to keep you away from that stuff.
I don't want you around dangerous things that can kill you.
Which would be a reasonable argument if my sister was chosen to protect the world from tax audits.
But, see, my sister is you, and dangerous things that want to kill me seem to find me.
But you don't need to go looking for them.
Eat up.
You're gonna be late for school.
OK, wait.
It was under her wig?
Well, it just came out from inside her head.
Oh, that's disgusting!
What did it look like?
Well, let's put it this way.
If I wasn't gay before - God, and this was after the invisible ray?
- Yeah.
- I'm gone for a couple of months - Did I tell you about the demon eggs?
See, now I know you're just trying to make me jealous.
- What, no rollicking adventures in the dorm?
- It's not the same.
It's not like living with family, or sharing a room with someone you Are friends with?
Hi.
- Oh, my God!
You're back.
- We've been so worried.
Yeah, sorry.
I I needed to, you know I couldn't stay here.
Not after everything that happened.
No, no, no.
We totally understand.
But you're back now, right?
It's complicated.
You know, there's a lot to deal with.
Well, if there's anything we can do Actually there's an eensy something I could use a little help with.
You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy.
Let's talk about Xander.
- He feels awful.
- You think it's anywhere close to what I feel?
- No, but - What if it were you, Dawn?
What if all you dreamed about was that magical day when the person you loved would promise to cherish your heart for the rest of his life, but instead he shatters it into a million jagged pieces?
Well, it's not really so much about hating the men.
We're more centred around the girl-on-girl action.
And men really like to watch that kind of stuff, don't they?
Men like Xander.
- I don't think he could feel any worse.
- Let's test that theory.
Anya, Xander's my friend.
I know what he did was wrong.
- If it happened to me, I'd - Wish his penis would explode?
- I never use that word any more.
- Coagulate?
W-i-s-h.
- Oh, "wish".
As in "l wish Xander" - Right!
That word.
There are vengeance demons that are still active, remember?
- Any "l wish" can end in horrible grossness.
- Give me a for-instance.
I don't think I should.
Did I mention the "left at the altar" thing?
Didn't leave that out, did l?
No.
Look, I know what he did was wrong.
God, if it happened to me, l It must have been torture.
OK!
Let's talk about torture!
So, tell me more about wishing Xander's brains and guts would go blooey.
- I didn't say that.
- You did.
- I didn't.
- I heard you.
- I swear I didn't say that.
- Say what?
Um I just saw you were back and wanted to talk to you about working off my debt.
You know, my whole sticky-fingers, grabby-hands thing?
Oh, right, the mad thieving!
Good, yes, there's much to do.
I'm gonna put you to work, missy!
Back to Xander's brains and guts Squish, squish, squish!
Guys have been running roughshod over you for years.
Torturing that little ticker.
Aren't you sick of it?
Don't you wish guys Whoa.
Guys?
There have only been four three.
Three.
Three guys.
That's barely plural.
Didn't each of them rip your heart out?
Don't men like that - to pick an example, Xander - deserve to be punished?
Well, Xander is a guy, so it's kinda not the surprise that he likes to watch girls.
- Why are we talking about this?
- We're comforting me!
Well, I guess it's natural for guys to be interested in God!
What kind of lesbians are you?
If you love men so much, go love men!
- Anya, I know you're hurting, but - What?
Xander doesn't deserve to suffer cos he's your friend and I'm not?
No.
That's not what I'm saying at all.
- What he did was wrong.
He knows that.
- It's just it hurts.
He hurt me so much.
He really did.
Look, I wish that Anya?
Congratulations.
They all still love you.
Even after what you did to me.
- Anya, wait - OK.
Not crazy about that idea.
- I have to go after her.
- Or, in the land of the sane, you could give her some space, let her cool down.
That's not Proactive Guy.
That's Sit Around and Watch the Rest of your Life Turn to Crap Guy.
True, but at least Crap Guy gets to keep all of his appendages.
And I'm supposed to what?
Walk away?
Shouldn't be too hard.
It's what I'm good at, right?
OK.
That's why a heart-to-heart is probably not your best course of action right now.
You're both angry and upset and What the hell is that creepy little thing doing in my yard?
Did Willow put that there?
I'd have crawled out of the grave sooner - Buffy.
- Oh, my God.
Someone's been keepin' an eye on all your ins and outs.
Who?
Well, now, let's see.
Who's obsessed with Buffy?
Who likes to hang out in her yard and keep an eye on her?
Who's in love with you and not getting any?
- What's this?
- It's a camera.
Yeah, I got that part.
Why am I holdin' it?
Someone was using it to spy on me, on my house.
- Xander thinks it's you.
- Oh, the great Xander thinks so.
Shudder, gasp!
It must be true!
- Spike - That ponce has always had it for me.
Every chance he gets, he sticks it You believe him, don't you?
You think I was spying on you.
- You think I could do that?
- You don't lie, cheat, steal or manipulate I don't hurt you.
I know.
No, you don't.
I've tried to make it clear to you, but you won't see it.
Something happened to me.
The way I feel.
About you.
It's different.
And no matter how hard you try to convince yourself it isn't, it's real.
I think it is for you.
I know that's not what you wanna hear.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
But, Spike, you have to move on.
- You have to get over - Get out.
No!
They're all "Poor Xander.
It took so much out of him, all that running away".
- I just don't understand these people.
- Did you really think they would help you?
But Do you want retribution, Anyanka?
- I want Xander good and cursed.
- Then you know what you have to do.
Get a wish from someone who doesn't freaking love him.
But my social circle is a little limited here.
Am I supposed to just stumble upon someone who doesn't give a fig's ass if Xander gets hurt?
Hey.
I need a thing.
- So, what's your pleasure?
- Fresh out of pleasure.
That's why I'm here.
I need something.
A numbing spell, maybe.
Uh-huh.
Hang on.
Oh, my God.
Spike hates Xander.
Maybe I could get him to wish Dammit!
If only he were a woman.
Got it!
If I can somehow get someone to wish that Spike were a woman, then I could go to him Well, he'd be a her by then.
I could go to her Anyanka, there's an easier way.
I know you have this female-power thing, and I think that's cute.
But I've been telling you for decades - men need a little vengeance now and then, too.
Oh.
Maybe this is a good chance to try that out.
Good luck with that.
Ta-ta!
Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.
That's OK.
I'm ready to do some business.
Right then.
Got something that'll dull the ache a bit?
Actually, yes.
Giles left a couple of supplies here that I think just might help.
Eases the hurt, makes the sun shine a little brighter, even makes boring people seem more interesting.
Ah!
Here.
Can you see who's getting the camera signal?
Should have something once I get tapped into the fibre optic network.
We're gonna use the feedback relay to get their signal routed into our system.
OK, if it's not Spike - and I'm not saying I believe him - but if it's not Spike, I think we already know who's behind this.
Makes sense.
I want to find these guys.
Uncover.
There.
That's it.
That's where we have to go.
Well, now that we've found out where to go Agh!
So then this girl says "Real for you".
Right.
But getting back to Xander Xander.
Let's not waste any more breath on that wanker.
But he made a fool of me.
And nobody seems to care enough to do anything!
I care.
What he done to you?
I'd never stoop that low, and I'm an "evil, soulless thing".
- According to some people.
- Shouldn't he pay?
Don't you wish he had to pay in some horrible way?
Absolutely.
Take him on myself, if it wasn't for my little handicap.
Right.
So, hypothetically, what do you wish you could do to him?
You name it, pet.
You're the wronged party.
Something gruesome, how about?
- Hey!
That's my blanket!
- That makes sense.
It was your fire.
Hey, hey.
I think I've got something.
Thing about it is, none of this was my idea.
I didn't ask to be human.
Right!
And I didn't ask for this bloody chip in my head.
To tell you the truth all I wanted was to use him and lose him.
I hadn't had a good tumble in a thousand years.
Me, too.
The using part.
I just wanted to know what I was missing, move on.
Yeah.
And he was all bumpy in the right places, and nice to me.
She was so raw.
I never felt anything like it.
Next thing you know, I'm changing to please him.
- I care if he cares!
- Right.
And I'm off my guard.
Happy!
I'm singing in the shower and doing my sexy dance!
Exactly.
I have no dance.
Talk to me, Will.
The technology's pretty sophisticated.
Lots of booby traps and firewall stuff.
- But can you get us a location?
- Well, hey, I'm still me.
Just one - Whoa.
- What?
There are other cameras.
- Screw'em!
- To the rafters!
I did everything for that man.
Was it ever enough?
Never!
I was always going above and beyond.
I saved the Scoobies how many times?
- And I can't stand the lot of you.
- Me either!
I hate us!
Everybody's so nice.
Nobody says what's on their mind.
You do.
That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
I have nothing but respect for a woman who's forthright.
Drusilla was always straightforward.
Didn't have a buggerin' clue about what was going on, but she was straight about it.
That was a virtue.
Xander didn't think so.
He thought I was rude.
That's because he's one of them.
Uptight.
Repressed.
- You think?
- Please.
It's no wonder they couldn't deal with the likes of you and me, love.
We should have been dead hundreds of years ago, and we're the only ones who are really alive.
Oh, my God.
The Doublemeat Palace.
The Bronze.
My classes on campus.
Xander's site.
What?
They've been spying on all these places?
I can tell there are more feeds.
I'm just having a harder time pinpointing them.
Here, let me Here.
Ladies last.
Thank you.
Take it quick or my chivalry'll run out.
No.
Thank you.
This is the first time since It just feels good to be with someone who understands.
Intimately.
This whole time, I've been coming on all hell-bent and mad.
- Wanting his head, you know - Yeah.
When really l can't sleep at night, thinking that it has to be my fault somehow.
Shh What if he's just pretending?
What if he never wanted me the way I wanted him?
- Ohh, I'm sorry.
- Now, now.
He would have to be more than just the git he is, Anya.
He'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to want a woman like you.
Then why?
The two of them they're weak, is all.
But I tell you what, though.
They'll miss the water now that the well's gone dry.
- Too hot to handle.
- Mm Too hot.
Um Just one question.
Hm?
Can I see your sexy dance?
I'll show you mine.
Wait, wait.
- What are we doing?
- Moving on.
I think there are a couple more transmitters on the network.
I just I've almost got a picture on'em.
You know I'm only doing this because I'm lonely and drunk and you smell really good.
See?
Forthright.
- Ah!
- They've tapped into our feed!
I think I've got the Magic Box.
Whoa!
Shut it down!
Shut it all down!
- I can't find - Here, dorkface.
- I'll get it myself!
- Guys, we have to Oh, holy crap.
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?
Porn?
- Oh, my God.
- Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
Oh, my God.
What are they?
Ohh.
- Is that?
- Spike.
He is so cool.
And I mean, the girl's hot too.
Dude.
Wait, Xander, no.
Oh, God.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
I What is she?
Buffy?
That's enough.
Here, let me just We aren't even really sure what we're seeing here.
There could be something - There.
Got it.
Xander?
So this is it?
This is the stuff you've been protecting me from?
You and Spike?
And a lot of monsters.
Uh-huh.
But it's over.
Spike.
- I wish you'd told me.
- I kinda didn't wanna admit it to myself.
I get that.
I know it must hurt to feel like you have to hide, to keep secrets from everybody.
Buffy, Xander's gone.
He took your axe.
Get up!
Get up!
You're just gonna sit there?
Do nothin'?
- That the kinda man you are?
- I'm not gonna fight you.
Chip.
Too bad.
Xander, no!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Xander, l - Don't even try to deny it.
Cos we saw it all.
The whole beautiful show.
How?
It was just It was just a thing.
I I felt bad, and he was just there.
Didn't take long, did it?
Oh, OK!
You had to do it, because he was there.
Like Mount Everest.
- Like I used to be.
- And then you weren't.
You left me, Xander, at the altar.
I don't owe you anything!
So you go out and bang the first body you can find?
Dead or alive?
Where do you get off, judging me?
When this is your solution to our problems.
I hurt you, and you hit me back.
Very mature.
No, the mature solution is for you to spend your whole life telling stupid jokes, so that no one will notice that you are just a scared, insecure little boy!
I'm not joking now.
You let that evil, soulless thing touch you.
You wanted me to feel somethin'?
Congratulations.
It worked.
I look at you and I feel sick, cos you had sex with that.
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of Buffy?
- Xander - I don't want to know this.
I don't want to know any of this.
Bloody Xander, buggered up everything.
- You know, I wish - Don't.
Things fall apart.
They fall apart so hard.
Tara?
You can't ever put'em back the way they were.
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry.
It's just You know, it takes time.
You can't just have coffee and expect I know.
There's just so much to work through.
Trust has to be built again, on both sides.
You have to learn if if we're even the same people we were, if you can fit in each other's lives.
It's a long important process.
Can we just skip it?
Can you just be kissing me now?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Previously: - Why won't you sleep with me again?
- Because I don't love you.
- Like hell.
- Thought you were gonna go see Tara.
- She was seeing someone else.
We should have some coffee sometime.
I'm free tomorrow.
- Whoa.
- Shut it all down!
- Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
What is she?
- That's enough.
You left me, Xander.
At the altar.
I don't owe you anything!
So you go out and bang the first body you can find?
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of Tara?
You can't just have coffee and expect - I know.
- There's just so much to work through.
Trust has to be built again, on both sides.
Can we just skip it?
Can you just be kissing me now?
When did morning happen?
After the moon went down.
I forgot how good this could feel.
Us, together.
- Without the magic.
- There was plenty of magic.
It's getting late.
- Wanna get up?
- No.
Oh, God, no.
I was just thinking about Buffy.
Oh.
- She still isn't back?
- I didn't hear her.
She wouldn't talk about what happened at the magic shop when she got home last night.
She just asked how close I was to tracing the camera signal back to the empire of the nerds.
Then she left again.
I'm sure she'll be OK.
Yeah, I'm not really worried about her going up against Warren and the others.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I think something might be going on.
With Spike and Buffy.
I mean, she looked so hurt when she saw him with Anya.
I think maybe They've been sleeping together.
No.
I wouldn't go that far.
No, I mean she told me they've been sleeping together.
Sleeping together?
You mean, like, the naked kind of together?
I'm sorry I didn't say anything but I promised her I wouldn't.
Does everybody know?
Am I the only one God, no.
She didn't even mean to tell me.
It just came out.
How could she hide something like this from me?
I think she was afraid of the look you'd get on your face.
- Kind of like the one you're wearing now.
- Oh, no, I'm not I'm just trying to understand.
So is she.
Wow, she probably really needs someone to talk to.
Probably.
We've been kind of busy.
Maybe we didn't hear her come home.
Buffy?
Is she back yet?
Not yet.
I'm sure she'll be home soon.
- Everything's fine.
Just go back to bed.
- It's ten o'clock.
Oh.
Uh You don't think she's gonna hurt Spike, do you?
- She told you about Spike?
- It was kinda obvious after last night.
Yeah, I totally knew.
It must have hurt so much.
To see him and Anya like that.
And poor Xander.
Everything is so screwed up.
It's gonna be all right.
It's just complicated.
When people have such strong feelings for each other, sometimes Is she back yet?
Oh.
Hey.
You and?
- That's my cue to go put some clothes on.
- No!
I'm totally not here.
You guys, you do whatever you want.
I'll go watch TV, downstairs, really loud, in the basement where I can't hear anything.
Oh, my God!
I love you guys!
All right!
Let's make this quick.
Fine.
But I'm not leaving till we have a little chat.
Very little, considering the pummelling that needs to occur.
I mean, guys, hello?
Slayer here.
Did you honestly think I wouldn't find you?
Well, that can't be good.
OK.
That's gonna cost you.
OK, we're here, ready for action.
Bad-guy-fighting action.
Guys, you didn't have to You know, if you still wanna be alone.
- No.
No, we're good.
- We're better than good.
- Great.
- Super.
Mm-hm.
- OK.
All right, we'll stop.
- Oh, you better not.
So, nerds - how are them they?
I found their lair but they knew we were tracing their signal.
They left in a hurry.
Van was gone, but everything else was still there.
We should go back.
Tara and I can sherlock around.
Nothing left now.
Giant buzz saw.
There was a thing.
This is all that I could save.
We need to go through it, see if we can find anything that might tell us what they're doing, where they're going.
This might take a while.
Anything we can do to fast-forward?
We need to find Warren before anyone else gets hurt.
Should we call Xander?
I don't think he's really in the Scooby space.
We need to give him some time.
Maybe they've heard something in the demon bars about those guys.
- Spike - Spike Spike's not part of the team.
So he's not going to be around any more?
I don't know, Dawn.
Not for a while.
What about Anya?
She might be able to help with the demon texts.
I'm guessing she's not feeling real researchy right now.
I know how you feel.
Maybe I can help.
How could Carl do that to me?
That bastard!
He's a man.
Look no further.
But with my sister?
She's not even pretty.
Well, it isn't always about looks.
Or a beating heart.
Sometimes intimate sweaty relations with the wrong person seems a good idea at the time.
She's fat.
He cheated on me with my fat, ugly sister.
Likes'em fleshy, huh?
Bet you wish he'd bloat up a few thousand pounds and pop like a big old meat zeppelin.
He said he loved me.
Then he must've meant it, cos guys never say anything they don't really mean, do they?
They say "l love you" and you think it's true.
They say "Oh, Anya, I wanna be with you for the rest of my life," and you believe them.
You believe they feel the same about you because that's the way love's supposed to be.
Who's Anya?
You get all excited, with the tingly anticipation, but wait.
Not so fast.
There's the apocalypse, the back from the grave, the blah, blah, blah!
By the time you're standing there in that expensive white dress you've dreamed of since you became human, he gets all heebie-jeebie and decides "I'd rather just go steady".
Men suck.
I wish Carl's flesh would He said it isn't me, but how can I believe him?
I mean, he knew he didn't wanna get married.
Deep down, he knew.
But he lied to me every day for months.
- I wish - He lied and lied and lied some more.
Who's gonna notice with all the other lies flying around like monkeys?
Then he thinks he can sweep the carnage under the rug by saying I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Please!
I'll never try to desecrate your chamber again.
Don't hurt me.
Please!
Hit him again.
Hit him again!
Wow.
They're tougher than I thought.
One jolt from this should have dropped an elephant.
You want a piece of this, huh?
Not so tough, are you, now, Pufnstuf?
Hey, hey, hey!
We need him fresh, all right?
Not smokehouse.
I'm done being the bait.
Next time one of you can wiggle on the hook.
If this works, the next time we'll be the thing that everyone's afraid of.
OK.
So what now?
Well, now it's your turn, Sparky.
Does it help?
Doesn't hurt.
Not planning a campout, are we?
No.
I'm sleeping over at Janice's.
Figured Willow and Tara might want some time to, uh So the birds are flying again, eh?
Ain't love grand?
I wanted to stop by on my way and you know.
Everybody's pretty mad at you.
Yeah.
Kind of picked up on that.
You're not gonna be coming around any more, are you?
It's complicated, Niblet.
Everybody's been saying that.
It must be true, then.
Was it worth it?
What you did with Anya?
Buffy told you?
Kind of caught the show.
There was a camera somewhere in the Magic Box.
Warren and Jonathan and that other guy had been watching Buffy.
Wankers.
Do you love her?
Oh, no.
No.
It was just a It was a bad day.
For both of us.
We just had a few drinks, and things just No.
Not Anya.
Buffy.
Do you really love her?
Then how could you do that to her?
Oh, right, cos big sis was treating me so well up until that point.
Must still be a bit of the evil left in me after all.
I don't know what happened between you two.
But what you did last night If you wanted to hurt Buffy, congratulations.
It worked.
This is it.
We found it.
- You sure it's in there?
- Be careful.
Only Nezzla demons can pass through the barrier.
- Everything else gets curly-fried.
- This sucks.
- Just make sure all your skin's covered.
- Why can't I just use a glamour?
You can't Siegfried-and-Roy the barrier.
It's gotta be the real deal.
- It's still wet.
- Good.
Then it should still be fresh enough.
"Should be"?
Wait a minute, what do you mean?
What do you mean, "should be"?
Wasn't sure that would work.
Jackass.
- You think he knows?
- Well, if he did, why would he be here?
Why is he?
Our mojo's tight, bro.
We could've pulled this ourselves.
Well, somebody had to guinea-pig the meat suit.
Were you gonna volunteer?
- I don't trust that leprechaun.
- Stay frosty.
This works the way we planned it, by the end of the evening Jonathan won't be a problem.
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.
- That's it?
- Better be.
No way I'm going back through there.
That thing stings like a mother.
- Dude, unholy hair gel.
- Get off.
- Make me, skin job.
- Shut up.
Gentlemen, the Orbs of Nezzla'khan.
Strength.
Invulnerability.
The deluxe package.
They're everything I've ever dreamed of.
Those things have been there for a zillion years.
How do we know they'll still work?
Oh, they work.
You don't look any different.
I thought they were supposed to make us all huge and veiny.
- Are you sure they're working right?
- Let's find out.
- Mahatma!
- Welcome to the show, boys.
- That was so hot.
- Let me try'em!
- Watch the paws, little man.
- Ow!
- We're supposed to share.
- Oh, relax.
You'll each get a whirl.
Soon as I'm done playing with'em.
Hey.
Hey.
I think there's a cold one in the fridge.
Thanks, but I think it's still a little early for me.
She loves you.
You know that.
Anya was just She was hurting.
She was hurting and she did this really stupid thing.
With your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
I know why Anya I understand, I do.
But you All those times I told Spike to get lost.
That he didn't have a chance with a girl like you.
- You don't know how hard it's been.
- What, lying to me?
Being here.
After I was brought back You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
- You could have told me.
- You didn't wanna know.
So you went to him instead?
Xander, what I do with my personal life is none of your business.
It used to be.
It just happened, OK?
Oh, like, "Say, you're evil".
"Get on me".
You fought side by side with him when I was gone.
- You let him take care of Dawn.
- But I never forgot what he really is.
God, what were you thinking?
You're asking me that?
Cos your decision- making skills have really sparkled lately.
I'm not saying I didn't make any mistakes.
But slaughtering half of Europe wasn't one of'em.
He doesn't have a soul, Buffy.
Just some leash they jammed in his head.
You think he'd still be all snuggles if that chip ever stopped working?
Would you still trust him with Dawn then?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not seeing him any more.
It's over.
Yeah.
There's a lot of that going around.
It's all a mess.
These things take time.
We'll figure it out.
Sure.
We'll decipher codes, foil evil schemes - Finally get out of bed.
- I was with you up until there.
Whoa.
What is it?
One of their data CDs.
It's filled with encrypted blueprints, schematics.
- To what?
- I'm not sure.
Their designations have been stripped.
Maybe we can cross-reference them with the county clerk's office.
Would that involve getting up?
- Eventually.
- Then I'm coming out firmly against it.
What about the trio's evil scheme?
Well, I'm kinda busy working on my own.
You're all wet.
- It's a good thing I'm part fish.
- Which part?
The part with the hook in it.
Careful.
Someone might reel you in.
Yeah, but then there'd be the flopping and the gasping.
Maybe it'd work out, but chances are I'd leave you in your white dress, find you spawning with another fish who's spawning my good friend night and day behind my back.
Then comes the fighting, and again with the flopping and the gasping.
Chicken of the Sea here's not doing too good with the women these days.
Huh?
Sorry, I'm just looking to curl up with the quiet alone tonight.
We don't have time for this.
Ease up, twitchy.
All right.
Let's make some noise.
Not bad.
How hard you gonna hit when you're blowing in the wind?
That was rhetorical.
Ow.
Are you hurt?
You're not moving so well.
- Get out.
- We have to talk.
- I really don't.
- Well, this isn't just about you.
As much you'd like it to be.
You spoke.
I listened.
Now leave.
I'm sorry.
Not that it matters any more, but I needed you to know that.
- Why?
- Because I care about you.
Then you might wanna try not sleeping with my friends.
I didn't go to Anya for that.
I was looking for a spell.
You were gonna use a spell on me?
It wasn't for you.
I wanted something.
Anything to make these feelings stop.
I just wanted it to stop.
You should have let him kill me.
- I couldn't do that.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Because you love me.
- No, I don't.
- Why do you keep lying to yourself?
How many times do I have feelings for you.
I do.
But it's not love.
I could never trust you enough for it to be love.
Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy.
Great love is wild, and passionate and dangerous.
It burns and consumes.
Until there's nothing left.
Love like that doesn't last.
I know you feel like I do.
You don't have to hide it any more.
- Spike, please stop this.
- Let yourself feel it.
- No.
- You love me.
- No, stop it.
- You love me.
Spike, stop!
Ow!
What are you doing?
Ow!
Let it go.
Let yourself love me.
- Buffy Buffy - Spike, no.
Ow!
I'm hurt!
Stop!
Ow!
Stop it, please!
I know you felt it when I was inside you.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Ow!
Ow!
Please!
Please!
- Spike - You'll feel it again.
- Please don't do this!
- I'm gonna make you feel it!
Stop!
Ask me again why I could never love you.
- Buffy, my God, I didn't - Because I stopped you!
Something I should have done a long time ago.
What are we doing here?
Somebody might recognise us.
This is great.
We're risking everything so that Charles Atlas can get a date.
He's gonna end up getting us thrown into jail.
Or worse.
- Maybe you and I should think about - Warren's the boss.
He's Picard, you're Deanna Troi.
Get used to the feeling, betazoid.
The clothes, and the cars, and the money, it's all just window-dressing.
Baby, this is what's really important.
- Two souls, coming together - Hey!
She only comes together with me.
So get lost, shrimp.
Frankie?
Oh, my God, is that you?
How long has it been?
It's Warren.
Remember?
Warren.
Gym class, fifth period?
You and your jock buddies gave me such a hard time.
That thing with the underwear?
God, I thought I'd never stop crying.
- That was you?
- That was me.
But, hey, no hard feelings.
I know you were just fooling around.
Like I'm gonna be with your girl in about five minutes.
- What'd you say?
- You heard me, meathead.
Go walk.
You're dead, you little This ain't high school.
Frankie!
Let's party.
Oh, don't worry about the tab, now, ladies.
It's on Daddy tonight.
Don't worry.
Daddy gonna give you some too.
I think it's the "Daddy" thing that's throwing her.
- Cos incest's not that sexy.
- Oh, crap.
Let's leave the ladies to their impending nausea and move the freak show outside.
OK.
But let me ask you something first.
You think you could put in a word for me with Anya?
If she's taking it from a vamp, I think I might have a chance.
No wonder she's screwing a dead guy.
You hit like a girl.
Well, at least I know how to get one.
- Let's see how popular you are with no face.
- We have to go.
We go when I'm ready.
Hey, it's your call, but we're gonna miss that thing you wanted to do tonight if we don't leave right now.
It's your lucky night, Shemp.
We just leave him?
What if he sics the Slayer on us?
Bring her on.
Buffy?
I found Warren.
Actually, my face kinda found him This what you call not seeing Spike any more?
What did he do?
Did he hurt you?
He tried.
He didn't - Son of a bitch.
- Don't.
Please, just don't.
Hey, I think we finally have something.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
What'd you find out?
We deciphered pretty much everything except these.
It isn't written in any ancient language we could identify.
It's Klingon.
They're love poems.
Nothing to do with the insidious scheme you're about to describe.
What have you got for me that doesn't rhyme?
This.
It was filled with blueprints and schematics.
To what?
Banks, armoured car routes, corporate vaults.
This is big.
They're looking to score some serious dinero.
We don't think they're planning just one job.
Spree, anyone?
- I can't cover all these at once.
- You don't have to.
- We think there's one they may hit tonight.
- It's time-sensitive.
Be careful.
Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse.
Emphasis on the "might".
Good.
Then I won't have to hold back.
Please, stop it!
Please stop!
Please don't do this!
Please!
- Please!
- Buffy - I'm gonna make you feel it.
- Stop!
Knock, knock.
I was just in the neighbourhood so I thought, you know There's a Knight Rider marathon on the TV, so I got hot wings!
What have I done?
Why didn't I do it?
What has she done to me?
She done who?
Oh.
Slayer, huh?
Gosh.
She break up with you again?
We were never together.
Not really.
She'd never lower herself that far.
She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey.
Issues.
And no wonder, with the whole coming back from the grave and whatnot.
I had this cousin who got resurrected by some kooky shaman.
Whoo, boy!
Was that a mess.
- Why do I feel this way?
- Love's a funny thing.
Is that what this is?
I can feel it.
Squirming in my head.
- Love?
- The chip.
Gnawing bits and chunks.
Maybe a wet cloth?
You know, everything always used to be so clear.
Slayer.
Vampire.
Vampire kills slayer, sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones.
It's always been that way.
I've tasted the life of two slayers.
But with Buffy It isn't supposed to be this way.
It's the chip!
Steel and wires and silicon.
It won't let me be a monster.
And I can't be a man.
- I'm nothing.
- Hey.
Come on, now, Mr Negative.
You never know what's just around the corner.
Things change.
Yeah, they do.
If you make them.
All right, that's the last one.
- Quite a haul, huh?
- Always the biggest gate of the year.
- Don't lose any.
- Yeah.
Wanna grab a bite after?
I think Rupert's is still open.
What the hell?
- There's something back there!
- I can't wait to get my hands on his orbs.
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be giving'em up any second now.
Hey.
Is this your bank?
Cos if not, there's gonna be a fee for that.
I was wondering when Superbitch would show up.
- You got a problem with strong women?
- Nothing I can't handle.
You seem a little off.
Is this a bad day?
It's gettin' better.
That all you got?
No!
There's two ways this can end.
And right now I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.
I think you're right.
What's the matter, baby?
You never fight a real man before?
Wow.
That almost hurt, kitten.
Kill her.
Kill her!
- You know who I am?
Huh, Slayer?
- You're a murderer.
Well, that too, but more to the point I'm the guy that beat you.
And it's not the muscles, baby.
It's the brains.
I'll remember that when I knock'em clean out of your Whoa!
Sparky, I didn't think you had it in you.
Orbs!
Smash his orbs!
Say good night, bitch.
Good night, bitch.
You're nothing but a sad little boy, Warren.
But it's time you grow up, and pay for what you've done.
Get away from me.
I swear to God I'm gonna take you down, you piece of Oh, come on.
Well played, Slayer.
Why didn't I get one of those?
This round to you.
But the game is far from over.
Jet packs.
You jerks were setting me up to take the fall.
He left me.
He flew away and left me.
Oh, God.
The big house.
How could he do this to me?
He promised we'd be together, but he was just using me.
He never really loved hanging out with us.
You think he'll come back for us?
I mean he wouldn't just take off, would he?
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.
And when I do, things are gonna change.
Hey.
Clothes.
- Better not get used to'em.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Xander.
- OK, not quite the response I was fishing for.
No, he's here.
Think they're making up?
I hope so.
That's the best part.
Time for the spring poking already?
Just making sure there are no more evil-trio cameras.
Or evil uno.
The sinister yet addictive card game?
Warren.
Jonathan and Andrew got clinked, but Warren pulled a Rocket Man.
You'll find him.
He won't be much good without his friends.
No, he won't.
How did we get here?
Scenic route.
Long drive.
- The past few weeks - I know.
I thought I hit bottom, but it hurt.
That you didn't trust me enough to tell me about Spike.
It hurt.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.
You would have, if I hadn't given you so many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it.
Guess we've all done a lot of things lately we're not proud of.
I think I've got you beat.
- Wanna compare?
- Not so much.
I don't know what I'd do without you and Will.
Let's not find out.
I love you.
You know that, right?
Buffy!
You think you can just do that to me?
You think I'd let you get away with that?
Think again.
Your shirt Tara?
Sweet fancy Moses!
Where the hell did he Oh, God.
Tara?
Baby?
Baby, come on!
Get up!
Oh, God.
Buffy?
Buffy?
Buffy?
No!
No!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Why won't you sleep with me again?
- I don't love you.
- Hey.
Clothes.
- Better not get used to'em.
Yes, ma'am.
Say good night, bitch.
Good night, bitch.
- Don't do - I'm gonna make you feel it.
Stop!
Ask me again why I can never love you.
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.
And when I am things are gonna change.
You think you can do that to me?
You think I'd let you get away with that?
Think again.
Tara?
Tara?
!
Baby?
Buffy?
No!
She's in the back.
This way.
- She was shot in the chest.
- Accidental?
No, no, it was a He was trying to kill her.
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
Please!
Please, come on!
Come on, Tara!
Please, come on, baby.
By Osiris I command you, bring her back.
- Pulse is 100 and weak.
Lung sounds are wet.
- What does that mean?
Is she gonna?
You need to stand back, OK?
If you want us to help her out we need some space.
Hear me, keeper of darkness!
Witch, how dare you invoke Osiris in this task?
Please.
Please bring her back.
You may not violate the laws of natural passing.
How?
How is this natural?
- It is a human death by human means.
- But l You raised one killed by mystical forces.
This is not the same.
She is taken by natural order.
It is done.
- No!
There has to be a way!
- It is done!
No!
Sunnydale Memorial, do you copy?
We have a Caucasian female, 21.
GSW to the chest.
Buff, hang on.
We're gonna get you to the hospital.
- Willow.
My God, are you OK?
- How did this happen?
- Warren, he had a gun.
- Warren.
It went down too fast.
I couldn't stop it.
Hey.
Will!
Sir, we have to go.
Are you coming with us or not?
Think they'll let my aunt bring me my Discman?
That's what you're worried about?
In-flight entertainment?
We're in jail.
We're in custody.
We haven't been charged yet.
Thank you, Dragnet.
It doesn't matter what they call it.
They got us, OK?
We're goin' down.
That guy's been lookin' at me.
I think he wants to make me his butt monkey.
Don't flatter yourself.
He's in here for parking tickets.
That doesn't mean anything.
The joint changes you.
I hear they like the small ones with little hands.
You have got to chill out.
This isn't Oz.
It's, like, Mayberry.
Besides, Warren is gonna get us out of here.
I'm sure he'll be bustin' us out any minute.
He will.
He's coming up with a plan.
Like WarGames.
Remember that decoder Matthew Broderick used?
Oh, yeah.
That was rad.
The one he made from the scissors and the tape recorder.
I miss Ferris Matthew.
Broadway Matthew I find him cold.
Really?
No, l Shut up!
Nobody's coming to get us, not even your aunt - who won't return your one phone call.
- She must be out of town.
She doesn't care.
And neither does your partner in crime Warren.
Don't say that.
What do you mean, my partner in crime?
We're in this together.
What do you mean, what do I mean?
You two were totally gonna leave me holding the bag.
- We weren't.
I was going to carry you.
- No.
You two were setting me up, and then Warren was gonna screw you over too.
- That is so not true.
- Sure.
He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.
You're wrong.
He's coming for us.
He's out there right now devising a brilliant way to get us out of here.
Whisky.
Straight up.
And get a round for the house.
I'm feelin' expansive.
Hey.
- Bet you don't get a lot of humans in - I'm watching my programme.
Wouldn't interrupt your me time.
Not even to buy the guy who killed the Slayer a drink.
- What's that?
- I took her out myself.
I've been heading an organisation - the Trio - you've heard of us.
Uh no.
Not important.
I cut them loose.
I figure now Buffy's out of the picture some things have got to change.
I need a real gang.
Not a couple of wannabes.
- And you killed the Slayer?
- With these hands.
- What are you, a warlock?
- Funny you mention that.
I've explored all the dark arts - witchcraft, demonology You name it, I tried it against the Slayer.
But you know what I found really works?
Gun.
- You killed the Slayer with a gun?
- In her own back yard.
Don't underestimate science, my friends.
Good old-fashioned metal meets propulsion.
- Oh, man, this is gonna be good.
- The best.
The town is ours!
Ours, maybe.
You are screwed.
Metal meets propulsion, yeah.
But you still better be a good shot.
This isn't the evil laugh of victory, is it?
More like the evil laugh of "you're a dead man".
OK, uh what's the joke?
It was just on the news.
A girl was shot.
In her back yard.
She survived.
She's in the hospital.
And Slayers heal fast.
Real fast.
Yeah.
I was gonna eat you myself during the commercial, but now I think it'll be more fun to let the Slayer de-gut you.
Might wanna get a head start, my friend, cos this girl's gonna be comin' for you big time.
- Willow.
- Where do you keep the black-arts books?
Something terrible happened, but you don't have to - I need power.
- Not with those books.
I can't let you.
Willow!
Stop.
That's better.
Buffy?
Buffy?
Hey?
Hello?
The door was Tara?
- All right, who's next?
- I am.
- You're new.
- Yeah.
I come bearing dead presidents, so you think we can just skip the small talk?
- How'd you find me?
- I talked to a guy.
One of your regulars.
Offered to show me the way for 20 bucks.
Most of my customers will bring you here for five.
Great.
I'll file that away.
Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here.
I tried to do us all a favour and eliminate the Slayer, but l I I guess it didn't take.
Killin' a slayer.
That's big business for a kid.
I'm not a kid.
OK.
I had my own guys.
The Trio.
Yeah, you've heard of us.
Right.
What were you?
A band or something?
I thought word travelled in the underworld.
We were evil.
Robots were my thing.
- You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
- Sorry.
- Why aren't your guys helping you?
- I thought this was a cash-for-a-service gig, not an interview process.
I need protection.
I've got the Slayer after me.
The Slayer is the least of your problems.
Oh, let's talk about my skin troubles.
I'd say, on the scale of problems, that she ranks.
If I were you, I'd worry about the witch.
- Witch?
Which witch?
- Willow.
The Slayer's pal.
She's the new power, man.
Anybody with intuition can feel it.
She's gonna blow this town apart.
Startin' with you.
Me?
What did I do to her?
Oh, OK, OK.
I - I shot her friend.
- I feel death.
But the Slayer is alive, and she heals.
Yeah, she might, but somebody is stone cold.
And that is why the witch wants your head.
She can sense your essence right now, man.
It's just a matter of time before she finds you.
Take it.
There's that, and I can get more.
Just give me something.
- Hide or fight?
- Both.
All of it.
I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but it's not enough.
I need a cover and lots of fire power.
I can't guarantee anything.
Not this time.
The girl is runnin' on pure fury.
I've never felt anything like it.
Thank you for the tip, Nostradamus.
Just load me up, OK?
- Gotta stop that bleeding by the left ventricle.
- BP is down to 80 palp.
- Got more bleeding.
What's happening?
Leave.
- Willow.
- Now.
Will, what are you doin'?
She's gonna die.
No, she isn't.
It's so small.
- What happened?
- Buffy!
- Oh, my God, are you OK?
- Sure.
How'd I get here?
You gotta stop doin' this.
This dying thing's funny once, maybe twice.
- Willow?
- Buffy.
Hey.
- What's wrong?
- I'll explain.
- But we've gotta go.
- Why?
It's time to find Warren.
- This'll get me all the way to the border?
- You'll have to change bus.
It's in the folder.
- Faster.
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- Faster!
- Cut that out.
If you wanted to drive - Stop.
I don't like this.
- We're close.
I can feel him.
We'll catch him and he'll go to jail.
I'm finding getting shot very motivating.
- But you're using magic.
- If I wasn't, you'd be dead.
Maybe.
But this isn't right.
OK?
This isn't how I want it.
- Sometimes you don't have a choice.
- Buffy gets the tiebreaker on this.
- She was on the ouchy end of the bullet.
- Will, you do have a choice.
- This isn't good for you.
- You decided to stop for a reason.
You promised us.
Can I ask what's with the makeover of the damned?
I mean, the hair - Turn right.
Go!
- Where?
Over there!
Now!
- Will - Turn.
Fine.
Puppet master wants to drive?
Go right ahead!
- Willow, wait!
- Stay back!
Get out.
Please.
I'll do anything.
It's a robot.
I could feel his essence.
- He tricked me.
We'll find him another way.
- And then what?
- Then we'll kill him.
- You need to calm down.
- Calm down?
- Look, you're angry.
There's no excuse for what he did, but He shot Tara.
When he shot you, he hit her too.
Upstairs, in my room.
- Guess the last shot was the charm.
- She's dead?
She's dead.
Now he's dead too.
Oh, my God.
Tara.
- Christ.
How come you didn't say anything?
- I'm busy.
Willow, please, just stop.
We love you.
And Tara.
But we don't kill humans.
It's not the way.
How can you say that?
Tara is dead.
I know.
I know.
And I can't understand anything.
Not what happened, and not what you must be going through.
Willow, if you do this you let Warren destroy you too.
You said it yourself, Will.
The magic's too strong.
There's no coming back from it.
- I'm not coming back.
- Will, please!
- We'll get through this together.
- We won't.
Not your way.
- Please, just - No.
No more talking.
It's done.
Willow?
Dawn?
Maybe she went to the hospital to find you.
I left there hours ago.
She would've been back by now.
Dawn?
Oh, God.
I didn't wanna leave her alone.
Dawn?
Sweetheart.
Come on.
Honey, we need to get outta here, OK?
Dawn, sweetheart?
Be strong for me, OK?
Dawn, we need to go downstairs.
I don't understand.
I don't understand either.
If you can just sign this?
Sure.
Call this number tomorrow.
We'll have more information.
OK, thanks.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- So that's it.
- Have the police gone too?
Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape.
We need to find Willow.
Yeah, she's off the wagon big time.
- Warren's a dead man if she finds him.
- Good.
Dawn, don't say that.
Why not?
I'd do it myself if I could.
Because you don't really feel that way.
Yes, I do.
And you should too.
He killed Tara and he nearly killed you.
He needs to pay.
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Xander!
I'm just sayin', he's just as bad as any vampire you sent to Dustville.
Being a Slayer doesn't give me a licence to kill.
- Warren's human.
- So?
So the human world has its own rules for dealing with people like him.
And we all know how well those rules work.
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they don't.
We can't control the universe.
If we were supposed to, then the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does.
And we'd be able to bring Tara back.
And Mom.
There are limits to what we can do.
There should be.
Willow doesn't wanna believe that.
And now she's messing with forces that wanna hurt her.
All of us.
I just I've had blood on my hands all day.
Blood from people I love.
I know.
And now it has to stop.
Warren's going to get what he deserves.
I promise.
But I will not let Willow destroy herself.
OK, where do we go?
She could be anywhere.
I don't know.
Maybe the Magic Box.
There's some kind of locating spell.
- I could go myself.
- No, no, I'm cool.
I'll go.
- Dawn can't stay here by herself.
- Let me go with you.
I want to.
No, honey.
It's too dangerous.
But it's Willow.
She needs us.
She does.
And you'll help her.
Lots.
OK?
But first we have to get her home in one piece.
- But - Dawn, I'm serious.
You've been through enough for more than one ever.
You should be someplace where you feel safe.
Fine.
I want to go to Spike's.
- All right.
- What?
- Are you kidding?
After what Spike did to - Xander!
I'll get the coats.
- You're leaving her with Mr Attempted Rape?
- He won't hurt Dawn.
He physically can't.
Besides, he wouldn't.
After the other night, I'd say all bets are off for what he's capable of.
Dawn feels safe with him.
We don't have a choice.
Right now, he's all we've got.
Blood of the slain, hear me.
Guide me to Tara's killer.
- John, why don't you forget this foolishness?
- Stop right where you are.
John!
John!
- Spike.
- Sufferin' cats!
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, Clem, sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's, uh, it's OK.
You just snuck up on me is all.
- I made you spill your snacks.
- Don't worry about it.
Like I need any more of this.
Oh, hi!
Hi.
Can I get you something?
Some Country Time?
- We're looking for Spike, actually.
- He didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?
- He left.
Town.
Oh.
- He just took off?
- That's why I'm stayin' here for him.
A sweet pad like this goes empty for a few days, he'll lose it for sure.
Plus l don't have a TV.
I'm surprised he didn't tell you.
He kinda left in a hurry, I guess.
Sure I can't get you somethin'?
I've got Bugles and, uh, liverwurst.
We're fine, thank you.
Um But you could do us a favour.
Do you think Dawn could hang out here with you for a while?
I have some stuff that I need to do, and I really don't want her to be alone.
- I still don't see why I just - Dawn, we've been through this.
- What do you think?
- No problem.
I'd love the company.
Do you like Parcheesi?
- Sure.
- Or we could rent videos.
- I'm dying to see The Wedding Planner.
- Either way, I'm good.
Oh, here.
- You can have the comfy chair.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- I promise.
- OK.
Thank you.
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- Spike?
No.
Only that he could be gone a while.
I'm not asking for permission, mate.
You seek me, vampire?
You do the finger paintings?
Nice work.
Answer me.
Yeah, I seek you.
Something about a woman.
The Slayer.
Bitch thinks she's better than me.
Ever since I got this bleedin' chip in my head, things ain't been right.
Everything's gone to hell.
And you want to return to your former self?
Yeah.
- What?
- Look what she's reduced you to.
It's this bloody chip.
You were a legendary dark warrior and you let yourself be castrated.
And you have the audacity to crawl in here and demand restoration?
- I'm still a warrior.
- You're a pathetic excuse for a demon.
Yeah?
I'll show you pathetic.
Give me your best shot.
You'd never endure the trials required to grant your request.
Do your worst.
But when I win I want what I came here for.
Bitch is gonna see a change.
Are you feeling any change?
Can you talk?
It's wearing off.
Willow put the whammy on me and then went straight to the dark-arts books and sucked them dry.
- Look, Anya, something terrible happened.
- I know.
Tara.
Willow's out for blood big time.
We need to find her before she finds Warren.
Is there something you can do?
A locator spell?
I don't need a spell.
I can feel her.
- You can - Feel her.
Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
Is that, like, left over from your vengeance-demon days?
You just sense her?
No.
Not left over.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- When?
- When do you think?
- Is everyone OK?
Did Willow?
- Got her power boost and took off.
Anya's Anya was saying she knows where Willow is.
- A spell?
- Not exactly.
Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
Oh.
So Willow's all wrathy.
Why don't you go to her?
Isn't that your gig?
Normally I'd have to.
But she doesn't want me.
- She wants to do it herself.
- Yeah.
Look, Anya, we don't have much time.
Which side of this are you on?
If you know where she is, you can help us.
I'll help.
But I'm helping Willow.
She's close to him.
He's in the woods.
Run all night, Warren.
I'll still find Axe not gonna cut it.
Freeze.
That's cute.
That's a cute trick.
It was an accident, you know.
Oh.
You mean, instead of killing my best friend, you killed my girlfriend.
- It wasn't personal, that's all.
- Well, this is.
Capture!
Irritite.
- Cute tricks.
- You are really askin' for it, you know that?
I'm asking for it?
I'm gonna walk away from this.
And when I do, you're gonna beg to join your girlfriend.
- She wasn't your first.
- First who?
- Tara.
She wasn't the first girl you killed.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Reveal!
I should've strangled you in your sleep.
Back when we shared a bed.
I should've done the world a favour.
- It's a trick.
- Why, Warren?
- You could've just let me go.
- Make it shut up.
Make it go away.
- It didn't have to be like that.
- I'm not kidding!
How could you say you loved me and do that to me?
Because you deserved it, bitch!
- Because you liked it.
- Oh, shut up.
You never felt you had the power with her.
Not until you killed her.
- Women!
You're like the rest.
Mind games.
- You get off on it.
That's why you had a mad-on for the Slayer.
She was your big O, wasn't she, Warren?
Are you done yet?
Or can we talk some more about our feelings?
- What's happening?
What do you feel?
- She's stronger now.
Close.
- What about Warren?
Has she?
- He's still alive.
She's not done.
Help!
Let me go.
Somebody!
Help!
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to talk.
No.
OK.
I'll talk.
- What are you doing?
- Shh!
Hey, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm sorry.
Wanna know what a bullet feels like, Warren?
A real one.
- It's not like in the comics.
- No.
No.
I think you need to feel it.
Oh, God!
Stop it.
It's not gonna make a neat little hole.
First, it'll obliterate your internal organs.
- Your lung will collapse.
It's like drowning.
- Please, no.
When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system.
- Please, stop!
- I'm talking.
The pain'll be unbearable, but you won't be able to move.
A bullet usually travels faster than this, of course.
But the dying?
It'll seem like it takes for ever.
Something, isn't it?
One tiny piece of metal destroys everything.
It ripped her insides out.
Took her light away.
From me.
From the world.
Now the one person who should be here is gone.
And a waste like you gets to live.
A tiny piece of metal.
Can you feel it now?
Over there.
I said can you feel it?
Please!
God!
I did wrong.
I see that now.
I need jail.
I need But you you don't want this.
You're not a bad person.
Not like me.
Willow!
When you get caught, you'll lose them too.
Your friends.
You don't want that.
I know you're in pain, but Bored now.
Oh, my God.
What did you do?
Willow, what did you do?
One down.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
This is what happened this year: Tomorrow night, we're bringing Buffy back.
We're talking about raising the dead.
I think I was in Heaven.
I was torn out of there by my friends.
I'm headed back to England.
And I plan to stay.
So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
We're your arch-nemesises.
Willow, you are using too much magic.
I don't think this is gonna work.
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
Willow has a problem.
I need help.
We kissed, Buffy.
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.
Are you afraid I'm gonna Things have changed.
The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
It's over.
I'm using you.
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations!
Xander's missing?
What do you mean?
I wish we could just go back to the way things were before.
And I wish you were never born!
You left me, Xander, at the altar.
So you go out and bang the first body you can find?
- It's good enough for Buffy.
- Shut up and leave her out of We can't ignore this behaviour.
Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
Can you just be kissing me now?
- Please - I'm gonna make you feel it.
Stop!
Ask me again why I could never love you.
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.
You think you can just do that to me?
Tara?
Tara?
Bring her back.
- It is done!
- No!
Something terrible has happened.
But you don't have to I need power.
What are you doing?
She's gonna die.
No, she isn't.
We need to find Willow.
And you want to return to your former self?
Bitch is gonna see a change.
Let me go.
Somebody!
Please!
God!
Bored now.
Willow, what did you do?
One down.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Again?
Xander, we don't have time.
I know.
It's just what happened back there.
The sounds of it.
- The smell.
- I know.
- Willow did that.
- That's why we have to keep moving.
You heard what she said: "One down".
She was talking about two to go, right?
Jonathan and the other guy.
Andrew.
They're in jail with no clue she's coming.
You don't think she's gonna kill them too?
She wouldn't.
She has an addictive personality.
She just tasted blood.
She may be there already.
No, she couldn't.
A witch at her level?
She can only go airborne.
It's a thing.
More flashy, impresses the locals, but it does take longer.
- Longer than what?
- Teleporting.
Right.
Vengeance demon.
Well, at least she'll get there first.
I'm counting the ways that can go wrong.
- Anya can handle herself.
- Against Willow tonight?
Don't be too sure.
Well, she should come down at some point, shouldn't she?
I mean, back there she was out of her head.
Running on grief and magics.
It doesn't matter.
Willow just killed someone.
Killing people changes you.
Believe me, I know.
Warren was a cold-blooded killer just warming up.
- If you ask me, the bastard had it coming.
- Maybe.
Andrew and Jonathan don't.
- This is still Willow we're dealing with, right?
- I hope so.
Whatever she's going through, we must stop her.
Maybe we can do that if we can get to your - car.
- Willow.
I guess she wants to finish the job without us tagging along.
- Meet me at the jail.
- Sure.
How are you gonna OK, then.
I'll just catch up.
She's only my best friend, you know.
No big deal, just glad I can help.
Dude, move, like, a foot to your left.
What for?
- I'm trying to hear something.
- Like what?
Signals.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Signals?
Who from, your probe-happy alien friends?
Say, maybe we can trade a pack of cigarettes in for tin foil.
- Make you a nice little antenna hat.
- Laugh it up, fuzzball.
I figured it out.
Warren never abandoned us.
Well, not me, anyway.
This is like his test.
If we can figure out how he's communicating with us, then we'll be you know, worthy.
You're checking for implants?
Lex Luthor had a false-epidermis escape kit in Superman vs the Amazing Spider-Man First of all, those were sonic disrupters.
Second of all, you are sadness personified.
Waiting for Warren?
Yeah, maybe he'll come bust us outta here in Santa's magic sleigh.
- I'm telling him you said that.
- Why wait?
Tell him right now.
- Warren, your girlfriend's pathetic.
Over.
- Shut up, Jerkathan.
You see this?
This is why we get jet packs and all you get is left behind.
- So you admit it?
- Why not?
You were out of the trail a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
And you wanna know why, little fella?
No respect for the chain of command.
See how far it's gotten you?
Checking every hole in your sad little body for transmitters.
I'll find it if I have to check every hole in my body and yours.
- Get off!
- Make me!
- There you two are.
- You do that?
Listen.
We have to get you out of here or you'll both be killed.
Guard!
- What's goin' on?
- Guard!
Stop that.
I don't trust her.
Do you trust her?
This is major uncool.
Uh Anya, you're gonna have to break this down for us a little.
Warren shot Buffy.
Warren shot Tara.
Buffy's alive.
Tara's dead.
Willow found out and, as the most powerful Wicca in the West, decided to get the payback, with interest.
What about Warren?
She killed him.
Ripped him apart and bloodied up the forest doing it.
Now she's coming here and the two of you are next.
- Oh, my God.
Warren.
- Oh, my God.
Me.
- Guard!
- We didn't do anything.
Guard!
All right, all right.
What do you - Who the hell are you?
- Something's coming.
Something bad.
You have to let these men out of here or I guarantee there will be hell to pay.
OK.
What exactly is coming?
One of the many things in this world you are not prepared for.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.
We're running out of time.
So believe me when I tell you these things are real, they're dangerous, and they're coming.
What the hell was that?
- I don't know what you're doing, but - Take a nap.
So please stop looking at me like it's your first trip to the circus and let them out.
- You three stay here.
- Oh, like we have a choice.
Don't move.
You'll be safe here.
Are you listening?
This is the one place they won't be safe.
Back off.
Hold it!
Stop it!
Just stop!
Why is she doing this?
Tell her we didn't do anything.
Yes, we did.
We teamed up.
We wanted to see where our plans would take us.
- Well, take a look.
This is it.
- Maybe for you.
Anya, teleport us out of here, please.
Take us with you.
I can't.
It doesn't work that way.
Oh, God Help!
Move!
- Buffy.
- Willow, just stop for a second and listen to Agh!
What's that sound?
God, it kills.
- We have to make a run for it.
- She's like Dark Phoenix up there.
- You expect us to just outrun her?
- Pretty much.
Get in.
Go, go!
Hey!
- Is she coming?
- I don't see anything.
Are you guys all right?
Are you injured?
- I don't think so.
- Where are you taking us?
We'll keep you someplace safe until we can stop Willow.
- Run and hide?
That's your brilliant plan?
- I don't believe this.
Boys, knock it off, or I will pull over and you can walk to your painful deaths from here.
I don't get it.
Willow's a witch.
Why doesn't she just wave her arms and make us dead?
She doesn't want you dead.
She wants to kill you.
But we didn't do anything.
Ow!
I hate to admit it, Buff, but Jonathan may have a point.
Why isn't she right here right now?
Maybe she's just getting her mojo up and running.
Or maybe she hasn't figured out exactly how much power she really has yet.
- Neither have we.
- Guess we keep running, then.
I still can't believe that was Willow.
I mean, I've known her almost as long as you guys.
Willow was you know She packed her own lunches and wore floods and was always just Willow.
- Jesus!
- What was that?
Just Willow.
- OK, any ideas?
- Drive faster.
This is faster.
She knows you're in this car too, right?
Right?
- She's draining.
- She's what-ing?
Just keep going.
Cool.
Not that I'm knockin' the nacho cheese ones.
I like the taste.
It's just the texture I can't deal with.
So gritty.
Kinda hurts my tongue.
So, I give'em a seven.
Maybe a seven-five.
And you think this is dumb, don't you?
No.
No.
As taste tests go, this is definitely one of the better ones I've been to.
I get it.
No biggie.
You wanna play cards?
I can be a real boredom-buster if you just give me a chance.
- It's not you.
- Still, I feel responsible.
It's not fair.
A girl your age cooped up in a crypt.
Tell you what.
Let me get my hat and coat.
I'll take you to a movie.
We'll go nuts!
PG-13.
- Clem.
- Uh-huh?
Look at me.
Do I look weak to you, or incapable?
- Heck, no.
- So why am I stuck here?
No good reason I can see.
I'm still real sorry about what happened.
If there's anything I can do to help, just name it.
Anything?
Oh You're not gonna go and get yourself in trouble now, are you?
Or me?
Cos your sister's the Slayer.
I'm a demon.
That's a good incentive to get along with her.
I need a demon to help me.
- Spike would have.
- Spike's gone.
You understand, then?
Yeah.
It's not like you haven't been clear about it, O great mysterious one.
This is a test.
I don't get what I want unless I pass it.
That about the size and shape?
Yes.
Since your pad is decked out gladiator-style, and no No.
2 pencils have been provided, I guess we're not starting with the written.
Oh, here we go, then!
Just me and the walking action figure.
I'm venturing this is a "kill or be killed" situation?
To the death.
Right.
Here we are now.
Entertain us.
Son of a Rack's place was around here last time.
I don't feel anything.
Oh, not here.
Let's go.
You don't feel anything because his place moves.
Know why Rack moves all the time?
Because he's shady.
- A bad element comes down here.
- I get that.
But Willow's part of it now.
She is the element.
If she isn't around, Rack may know where she is, - which is why we need to talk to him.
- We?
In a face-to-face way?
- Or me.
I'll go in there without you.
- No, it's fine.
I'm good.
It's just Rack's not partial to the floppy-eared.
He has a thing.
But, hey!
I'm in, absolutely.
Either way.
Just get me there.
Say Rack does know, he won't tell you for nothing.
- He's gonna want something.
- I have money.
That's not the something he'll want.
He likes little girls.
- I am not a little girl.
- I don't know if you've thought this through.
I'm supposed to keep you safe, and this whole thing is I mean, even if you find Willow, you really think you can stop her?
Thanks for getting here so fast.
Big help.
Once again, Xander in need of big help.
Whatever.
So, can you still sense Willow?
Knowing her location would be a real big comfort right about now.
No, I can't.
Which means she's gone way beyond simple vengeance.
Did I mention the comfort?
Whatever we got, grab it fast.
This is the first place she'll look for us.
Then why are we here?
I could summon a demon that would kill her.
- I could smack your eyes out of their sockets.
- No one is getting killed.
Sit down.
We need to find some magics to stop Willow, or at least slow her down.
She drained the place.
Took everything.
- Not everything.
- What is it?
A book of protection spells.
Anti-magic.
Our last resort.
You think you can work this stuff?
OK.
Well, good news is, the text is intact.
Bad news is, I can't read a word of it.
It's, like, in ancient Sumerian or something.
- Could I take a look at it?
- Shut up.
Right.
I just thought, as long as you're protecting us I'm not protecting you, Jonathan.
None of us are.
We're doing this for Willow.
The only reason it happens to be your lucky day is because, if Willow kills you, she crosses a line, I lose a friend.
- And I hate losing.
- I get that.
It's just You know she's running out of power, right?
I can tell.
I can practically feel it.
I've dabbled in magics.
I think Willow's in a league of her own now, dabble boy.
But still, running that hot for that long, at some time you gotta recharge, no matter how juiced up you are.
Thank you.
Now, remember that thing we talked about?
About me shutting up?
Right.
Buffy.
Buffy, let's say this works and we stop Willow working the hoodoo for a minute.
- What then?
- I talk to her.
Great.
And say what?
Look, whatever she's gonna do, she starts with those two.
They're the line she cannot cross.
And if she is running low on magics, she's probably somewhere right now trying to get it all back.
Hey, babe.
I've been waitin' for you.
Guess the rehab didn't take, huh?
That's the way it goes sometimes.
But I gotta say I could feel you comin' a mile away, the power you got.
And you know something, sweetness?
I liked it.
When you first came to me, you were just a little slip of a girl.
Look at you now.
So growed-up.
Just full of dark juice.
And you still taste like strawberries.
Only now you're ripe.
You came because you want something, don't you?
I thought so.
So tell me, strawberry.
What on this earth do you want?
- Just to take a little tour.
Yay, Clem.
Makin' with the demon senses.
I knew you could find this place.
- It's not very clean.
- Don't wig out on me again.
It's just I'm still not so sure you should be here.
- I'm not so sure I should be here.
- It'll only take a minute.
Come on.
- You wanna wait here?
- If that works for you.
Be right back.
Willow?
Hey, cutie.
Dawnie, what are you doing here?
Cos if you're lookin' for me, now's not a great time.
- You look terrible.
- Do l?
- You're back on the magics.
- No, honey.
I am the magics.
Did you kill that guy?
It's an improvement, believe me.
I have to go.
Oh!
Why?
So you can run and tell Buffy?
Willow, please just listen to me.
You don't have to talk.
Just think real loud.
I can hear you.
- You're freaking me out.
- Oh, don't be like that.
I'm just a little wired.
And I have some things to do.
I thought if anybody'd understand I miss Tara, too.
But this?
What you're doing here?
This is not the way to go.
You're only going to make things worse.
But I promise, it's not too late - You miss her?
- Yes.
Did you cry?
Of course you did.
I get that.
I understand the crying.
You cry because you're human.
But you weren't always.
Yes, I was.
No, please.
You're telling me you don't remember?
You used to be some mystic ball of energy.
Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, Dawnie.
Cos you don't belong here.
Wanna go back?
End the pain?
You'll be happier.
I'll be happier.
We'll all be a lot happier without listening to the constant whining.
Willow, stop.
"Mom!
Buffy!
Tara!
Waah"!
It's time you go back to being a little energy ball.
No more tears, Dawnie.
I think you need to get away from her.
- You're too close.
- How am I supposed to read?
I don't know.
I'm staring right at this stuff and I can't read it.
Well, how's the translation coming?
What have we got so far?
So far we've got "the".
Well, either "the" or "towards", I'm not really sure.
I can't do this.
I'm in retail.
Stupid ancient Sumerian.
I'm pretty sure it's Babylonian.
The text is similar, but the dialect is different.
Great.
Babylonian.
Thanks a bushel.
But, unless you can read Babylonian, why don't you sit back down?
- Why are you helping them?
- Because they're saving our lives, moron.
Uh-huh.
And what then?
Even if they kill that Wicca bitch, you think they're gonna let us walk?
- They own us.
- So what do you want me to do?
Look around.
You know magic.
We're in a magic shop.
We can take them.
The books are sucked dry, but so what?
There's still tons of supplies all around us.
This is our best chance to make it out of here.
- And do what?
- Start over.
We can be a duo.
You and me.
You can even be the leader.
I swear I'll take orders.
I like taking orders.
Just tell me what to do.
You want an order?
- Grow up.
- Play nice or you'll break our concentration.
Which means no protection spell.
And Willow will make you two boneless chickens skinless too.
And then what?
You think your little witch buddy's gonna stop with us?
You saw her.
She's a truck-driving magic momma!
We've got seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds us into Jawa burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midichlorians to stop her.
You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?
The annoying virgin has a point.
What if Willow filets their souls and comes after us?
- She won't.
- You don't know that.
We're her friends, Anya.
Her family.
She would never hurt us.
She tried to use you for a hood ornament, Xander.
She doesn't care if you live or die.
I guess you two finally have something in common.
I care if you live or die, Xander.
I'm just not sure which one I want.
Again with the comfort.
Look, we both know things might get ugly at Wiccapalooza.
- And if it gets really bad - Let me guess.
You'll propose?
I need to know if you're gonna turn on me.
Use this little shindig as an excuse for some sweet revenge.
There is nothing in this world that would give me greater satisfaction than to wreak bloody vengeance upon you, Xander Harris.
But I can't.
Not officially.
Not magically.
So smile.
It's your lucky day.
You got away with it.
I can't hurt you.
You varnishing the table with Spike, how could that possibly have hurt?
- It may have chafed - That wasn't vengeance.
It was solace.
Look I really can't hurt you, so I'm just gonna have to settle for hating you.
- If that's what you need to do.
- Don't play the martyr!
- I'm not.
- This wouldn't be happening but for you.
You think I don't know that?
You think I'm the hero of this piece?
I saw the gun.
Before Warren raised it, l I saw it and I couldn't move.
He shot two of my friends before I could even You want me to know how useless I am?
That it's my fault?
Thanks.
I already got the memo.
I was talking about us.
You need to back down a minute and think, Will.
I wasn't gonna hurt her, buzzkill.
She tried to turn me back.
You're attacking the people who love you now?
Only the ones in my way.
That's not You need help.
I'm doing fine on my own, thanks.
Dawn, get out of here.
Go.
Don't.
We're all friends.
Willow, I know what you wanna do, but you have to listen to me.
The forces inside you are incredibly powerful.
They're strong, but you're stronger.
You have to remember you're still Willow.
Let me tell you somethin' about Willow.
She's a loser, and she always has been.
People picked on Willow in junior high school, high school, up until college, with her stupid, mousy ways.
And now Willow's a junkie.
- I can help.
- The only thing Willow was ever good for The only thing I had going for me were the moments just moments when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful.
And that will never happen again.
I know this hurts bad.
But, Willow, if you let loose with the magics, it'll never end.
- Promise?
- You don't want that.
- Why not?
- Because you'll lose everything.
Your friends.
Yourself.
Willow, if you let this control you, then the world goes away, and all of us with it.
There's so much to live for.
Will, there's too much Oh, please!
This is your pitch?
Buffy, you hate it here as much as I do.
I'm just more honest about it.
- That's not true.
- You're trying to sell me on the world?
The one where you lie to your friends when not trying to kill them, you screw a vampire just to feel, and insane asylums are the comfy alternative?
This world?
Buffy, it's me.
I know you were happier when you were in the ground.
The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life was when you were dead.
Until Willow brought you back, you know with magic.
Sorry, the trip can be kinda rough if you're, you know not me.
Dawn!
Jonathan.
Andrew.
You boys like magic, don't you?
Abracadabra.
OK.
Didn't see that coming.
- What was that?
- We're alive.
You guys wanna take it slow?
I can do that too.
Ask Warren.
Don't!
Let's get outta here.
No, no.
Stay.
I mean, we're just getting started.
I've got big party plans.
- Will - No, don't.
Guys, come on.
I'm just getting the wood for the violence here.
And you know what they say: If at first you don't succeed Had enough?
Ow!
Bad move, bad move, bad move.
Looks like local boy loses.
So it would appear.
Good on me, then.
I get what I came for.
I passed, right?
Indeed.
You have passed the first stage of the test.
Right.
I get it.
- Wait.
First stage?
Bugger.
Damn, that is one effective counterspell.
- Won't keep you alive, though.
- Will, stop.
You need to give this up now.
I get it.
You boys put a spell on yourselves, didn't you?
Protecting you from harm, from magics.
That's cute.
Will, back off before somebody gets hurt.
How about I back off right after?
So, which one of you boys worked the mojo?
Doesn't matter really.
I just I'm curious.
Just because I can't do magics to you doesn't mean I can't do them on myself.
Da mihi.
Now I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough to beat you to death.
I don't wanna hurt you.
Not a problem.
I said I didn't want to.
Didn't say I wouldn't.
- Let's go.
- What about Willow?
- Buffy can handle her.
- Are you sure?
No.
That's why we're leaving.
An.
I can't.
I have to keep the spell going on Willow.
- No, but - Go.
Do something right.
No!
So, here we are.
Are we really gonna do this?
Come on!
This is a huge deal for me.
Six years as a sideman, now I get to be the Slayer.
A killer isn't a slayer.
Being a slayer means something you can't conceive of.
Oh, Buffy You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked.
Then show me what you got, and I'll show you what a slayer really is.
- Where are you taking us?
- Someplace safe.
- Like where?
- Xander?
I don't know.
Get off, superbitch!
I can help you stop.
You were gonna show me what a slayer was.
I can't run any more.
Need to breathe.
If you wanna keep breathing, you gotta keep moving.
This is bogus.
We've gotta get out of this town.
Mexico.
We should go to Mexico.
Hey, you're not goin' anywhere.
We've gotta hide you until we get the all clear from Buffy.
What if the Slayer's dead already?
We just wait for Sabrina to come and disembowel us?
- You do what I say to do - I don't think so.
Well, hey.
Isn't that interesting?
Anya's still here.
Looks like I've been beatin' on the wrong gal.
Whoa, whoa.
OK, Andy.
Let's just put the sword down.
No way.
I'm not gonna die because of something I didn't even do.
You're not gonna die.
Leave him alone.
Let him go, Andrew.
You heard me.
- You let me go first.
- Uh-uh.
Him.
- It's your move.
- No.
Yours.
I'm not moving I'm not gonna budge till right now.
Ow!
Xander's right.
We're not leaving Sunnydale.
When this is over, you and l are going back to jail to do our time.
Help me!
- Help me!
- You can't block my spells if you can't chant.
And you can't chant if you're sleeping.
Buffy, I gotta tell ya I get it now.
The Slayer thing really isn't about the violence.
It's about the power.
And there's no one in the world who has the power to stop me now.
I'd like to test that theory.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": And you want to return to your former self?
Bitch is gonna see a change.
You think you can just do that to me?
Tara.
Buffy.
- How did this happen?
- Warren, he had a gun.
We need to find Willow.
She's off the wagon big time.
Warren's a dead man if she finds him.
Willow!
- What about Warren?
- She killed him.
The two of you are next.
- Get in.
- Go.
Willow, just stop for a second.
Buffy.
- Is she coming?
- I don't see anything.
I get it now.
It's about the power.
- Let's go.
- What about Willow?
- Buffy can handle her.
- Are you sure?
No.
That's why we're leaving.
And there's no one in the world who has the power to stop me now.
I'd like to test that theory.
Giles?
Giles!
Uh-oh.
Daddy's home.
- I'm in wicked trouble now.
- You have no idea.
You have to stop what you're doing.
Sorry.
Can't do that.
I'm not finished yet.
Neither am l. Stay down.
How'd you do that?
That's borrowed power.
No way is it gonna be strong enough I'm here to help you.
Thanks, but I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself.
But, hey, if you'd like to watch And that's what you watchers are good at, right?
Watching.
Butting in on things that don't concern you.
You concern me, Willow.
Stay on this path and you'll wind up dead.
Willow, listen to him.
I don't wanna fight you any more.
I don't wanna fight you either.
I wanna fight him.
- Stay down.
- No.
Remember that little spat we had before you left?
When you were under the delusion that you were still relevant here?
You called me a rank, arrogant amateur.
Well, buckle up, Rupert.
Cos I've turned pro.
- Asmodea, bring forth - Vincere!
What No!
Get off!
Solvo Libero What did you do?
Contained her and her powers within a binding field.
It puts her in a kind of stasis, for the time You cut your hair.
I'm blonde.
I coloured my hair.
Again.
I'm blonde.
Yes, I noticed.
I'm very sorry about Tara.
This won't hold me for ever.
I came as soon as I heard.
The Council?
The Council haven't a clue.
About much of anything, really.
No, there's an extremely powerful coven in Devon.
They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here in Sunnydale.
A dark force fuelled by grief.
Willow.
I'd so hoped it wasn't her.
And then a seer in the coven told me about Tara.
That's when the coven imbued me with their powers.
And sent you here to bring Willow down?
Buffy, what's happened here?
God I don't even know where to start.
Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the magics.
She has.
She was.
And I barely even noticed.
Giles, everything's just been so Xander left Anya at the altar, and Anya's a vengeance demon again.
Dawn's a total klepto.
Money's been so tight that I've been slinging burgers at the Double Meat Palace, and and I've been sleeping with Spike.
Sorry.
Anya.
Willow?
I need you, Anya.
I need you to do something for me.
I know what you're trying to do.
But that mind-control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just - Stop talking and listen.
- OK.
You need to free me.
No.
You don't wanna call out to them.
You wanna take away this binding spell.
- I don't know how.
- I do.
Do you want me to tell you?
- Duct tape?
- On their mouth!
So the demon, he said Because they were figments!
All of it.
You, Sunnydale And I was just some nutcase in LA.
Of course.
Why didn't we see it before?
Can you forgive me?
- For what?
- I should never have left.
No.
You were right to leave.
We're just stupid.
I know you're all stupid.
I should never have abandoned you.
No.
Giles, you were right about everything.
It is time I was an adult.
Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ask for help when you need it.
Now you tell me.
I guess I wasn't ready before.
It took a long time for that feeling to go away.
The feeling that I wasn't really here.
It was like when I climbed my way out of that grave, I left something behind.
Part of me.
I just I don't understand why I'm back.
You have a calling.
But it was my time, Giles.
Someone would have taken my place.
So why?
Right.
What's gonna happen to Willow?
Well, the coven's working on a way to extract her powers without killing her.
And, should she survive You ought to know, Buffy, that there's no guarantee she'll be as she was.
Willow's killed a human being.
How will she be able to live with herself?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Willow doesn't live here any more.
- Vincere!
- Solutum.
Fool me once Willow Shame on you.
Tego!
Excudo!
- Where are we going?
- I have no idea.
- What?
- I don't know, OK?
I can't even run away well.
That's something I'm usually good at.
- Maybe we should go back and help.
- Yeah, cos I've been such a big help already.
Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot.
Tara's dead, and Willow's losing it.
Well, feeling sorry for yourself isn't helping either, Xander, OK?
You know, if Spike were here, he'd go back and fight.
Sure - if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.
What?
Forget it.
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.
He wouldn't do that.
Is this blind spot a genetic trait with the Summers women?
The only useful thing Spike ever did was finally leave town.
Well, that was a bloody doddle and a piece of piss.
You got any more ruddy tests for me, you ponce?
I'll take anything you can throw at me.
If it'll get me what I need to take care of the Slayer.
Give her what's coming to her.
You just bring it on.
Bring on the whole Bloody hell.
That all you got, Jeeves?
Cos I could stand to go another ten rounds.
Whereas you can barely stand.
Your powers may be undeniably greater, but I can still hurt you if I have to.
Boy, you just don't get it, do you?
Nothing can hurt me now.
This is nothing.
It's all nothing.
I see.
If you lose someone you love, then the other people in your life who care about you become meaningless.
I wonder what Tara would say about that.
You can ask her yourself.
You're always saving everyone.
It's kinda pesky.
You probably even think you're buying escape time for Jonathan and the other one.
Well, I got a little secret for ya.
I can kill them from anywhere I want.
With this.
It'll find them.
It'll bury them.
Along with anyone else helping those dead men walking.
Don't.
Unless somebody, somehow, can get there in time to save them.
Huh.
Oh, well.
Fly, my pretty, fly.
- See what I did there?
- Go.
Good luck.
Thought she'd never leave.
Now I finally have you all to myself.
You're such a hypocrite.
Waltzing in here with your borrowed magics So you could tell me what?
"Magic's bad.
Behave.
Be a good girl".
Well, I don't think you're in any position to be telling me what to do.
Do you?
I used to think you had all the answers.
That I had so much to learn from you.
Willow You were jealous.
Still are.
Just couldn't bear that I was the one with power.
- That's why you ran away.
- Incurso!
That's why you That was rude.
Now I forgot what I was saying.
Perhaps you're not as strong as you think you are.
You're expending way too much of your mystical energies to maintain your powers.
At this rate you're going to burn out and Blah, blah, blah.
Willow, you need to stop.
What I need is a little pick-me-up.
Whoa!
Head rush!
Wow Who's your supplier?
This is wow It's incredible!
I'm so juiced!
Giles, it's like no mortal person has ever had this much power - ever.
It's like I'm connected to everything.
I can feel It feels like I can feel everyone.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
All the emotion and the pain.
No, it's it's too much.
Oh, it's just too much.
Willow It doesn't have to be like that.
You can stop it.
Yeah.
I I can.
I have to stop this.
I'll make it go away.
No Oh, you poor bastards.
Your suffering has to end.
No Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Buttwipe!
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Oh.
Reflex.
Man, they've really tightened security up here.
One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.
Hide out in the cemetery - what a fantastic idea!
I'm working on a "shut the hell up" pitch you might like too.
Xander I've had just about as much as I can stand babysitting a couple of social retards - who don't appreciate - Xander.
- What?
- What is that?
Get out of there!
Move!
Dawn!
Dawn - Hold on.
Mexico, huh?
Giles!
Giles!
Anya.
I'm so sorry.
Willow forced me to free her with her brain.
Are you OK?
I can see.
Oh.
It's a miracle.
Willow I can see her.
She took the magic I had and I know where she is.
I can feel what Oh, God.
Giles, you have to rest.
Silly girl.
I'm dying.
No, you're not.
It was it was the only way.
I thought we there'd be a chance, but now I know where Willow is.
She's going to finish it.
Finish what?
The world.
No!
Aargh!
Buffy!
- Are you OK?
- We have to get outta here.
- Xander!
- I think I saw him hit his head.
Xander!
This looks a little like Spike's place.
You know, under his crypt?
- What are you doing?
- If we can pull these out, we can use the coffins for height and maybe get outta here.
Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses is around here.
We could get to his place.
That's the last place on earth we need to be.
Oh.
But it was good enough for you to take me there after what he did to you?
- What he?
- Tried to do.
Whatever.
- Xander.
- So it's true.
Dawn, you may not have noticed, we are in really big trouble here Why did you not tell me?
- Because you didn't need to know.
- Yes, I do.
I need to know.
I'm not a kid any more.
- Dawn, I am trying to protect you!
- Well, you can't.
Look around, Buffy.
We're trapped in here.
Willow's killing, and people I love keep dying.
And you cannot protect me from that.
- Dawn - Hello?
Xander?
Buffy, are you OK?
- Where's Dawn?
- Here.
Are Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
No.
They must've skedaddled when I was out.
Weasels.
Whoa!
Xander, you've gotta find a rope or something and get us out of here.
Right.
OK, I'll, uh I'll take a look around.
And hurry up, before - Holy frijole!
- What are you doing here?
Where's Giles?
- Giles?
- He's at the magic shop.
- Giles is back?
You didn't tell me that.
- Did he stop Willow?
- No.
And things just got a whole lot worse.
- How worse?
End-of-the-world worse.
Willow's going to destroy it.
She can do that?
She can and will when she gets where she's going.
- Where is she going?
- Big old satanic temple.
Kingman's Bluff?
There's no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
Proserpexa?
Who's she?
Way up there in the hierarchy of she-demons.
Her followers intended to use her effigy to destroy the world.
They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the big earthquake of'32.
So now, 70 years later, Willow's gonna make their dreams come true?
She's going to drain the planet's life force, funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and burn the earth to a cinder.
- Not if I can help it.
- You can't.
Something else Giles said - no magic or supernatural force can stop her.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
He said "The Slayer can't stop her", then a bunch of other stuff.
He really wasn't too clear.
- Anya, what do you - Look, l I should get back to him.
He's alone.
Is he OK?
I don't think he has a lot of time left.
I'm sorry.
Xander!
Where is that rope?
- Buffy - Xander!
Where is he?
You heard what Anya said.
You heard what Giles said.
I heard, and I don't care.
I have to try.
From the pit of forgotten shadows I'm not sitting here while Willow incinerates what I'm chosen to protect.
- I have to stop her.
- Always the Slayer.
Right to the last.
- Willow?
- And it is the last, you know?
For all your fighting, thinking you're saving the world.
Buffy?
And, in the end, I'm the only one that can save it.
By killing us?
It's the only way to stop the pain.
I can't take it any more.
But I know you, Buffy.
You're a warrior.
You won't go out without a fight.
I don't really have time for one.
But you should go out fighting.
- Willow, what are you - It was me who took you out of the earth.
Well, now the earth wants you back.
Buffy!
They just keep coming.
I can't take'em all.
Dawn Will you help me?
I got your back.
Proserpexa, let the cleansing fires from the depths burn away the suffering souls and bring sweet death.
Willow Giles!
Giles!
Don't die.
Not yet.
There are things I wanna tell you.
Thanks a lot for coming.
It was good of you to teleport all this way.
Though in retrospect it probably would've been better if you hadn't come and given Willow all that magic that made her, like, ten times more powerful.
That would've been a plus.
Hey, black-eyed girl.
Whatcha doin'?
- Get out of here.
- Oh, no.
You're not the only one with powers.
You may be a hopped-up über-witch, but this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century.
I'm not joking, Xander.
Get out of my way - now.
There.
What?
It's not over.
Dawn!
I'm coming!
What?
You think I never watched you?
You can't stop this.
Yeah.
I get that.
It's just, where else am I gonna go?
You've been my best friend my whole life.
World gonna end, where else would I wanna be?
Is this the master plan?
You're gonna stop me by telling me you love me?
I was gonna walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but it seemed kinda cartoony.
Still making jokes.
I'm not joking.
I know you're in pain.
I can't imagine the pain you're in.
I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid.
And, hey, I still wanna hang.
- You're Willow.
- Don't call me that.
The first day at kindergarten, you cried because you broke the yellow crayon and you were too afraid to tell anyone.
You've come pretty far.
Ending the world - not a terrific notion.
But the thing is yeah, I love you.
I love crayon-breaky Willow and I love scary, veiny Willow.
So if I'm goin' out, it's here.
If you wanna kill the world, well, then start with me.
I've earned that.
- You think I won't?
- It doesn't matter.
- I'll still love you.
- Shut up.
I love you.
I love you.
Shut up!
I love you, Willow.
Stop!
- I love you.
- Stop!
I love you.
What happened?
Giles!
- You're not dead!
- No.
Oh!
- However, I am still in some pain.
- Oh.
Well, why aren't you dead?
Why aren't I dead?
The threat's gone.
Willow's been stopped.
Oh.
- You mean she's - No, she's alive.
It The magic she took from me, it did what I hoped it would do.
You dosed her.
You knew she'd take your powers all along.
The gift that was given me by the coven is the true essence of magic.
Willow's magic came from a place of rage and power.
And vengeance.
Don't forget vengeance.
How could l?
In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into the spark of humanity she had left.
Helped her to feel again.
Gave Xander the opportunity to reach her.
Xander?
Yes.
It was he who got to her in time.
He saved us all.
I I think it's over, Buffy.
The world's still here.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Wait.
Is is that happy crying?
Yes, dummy.
You think I wanted the world to end?
I don't know.
Didn't you?
Dawn I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's OK, Buffy.
It's OK.
No.
It hasn't been.
It hasn't been OK.
But it's gonna be now.
I see it.
See what?
You.
Things have really sucked lately.
That's all gonna change.
And I wanna be there when it does.
I wanna see my friends happy again.
I wanna see you grow up.
The woman you're gonna become.
Because she's gonna be beautiful.
And she's gonna be powerful.
I got it so wrong.
I don't wanna protect you from the world.
I wanna show it to you.
There's so much that I wanna show you.
You have endured the required trials.
Bloody right I have.
So you give me what I want.
Make me what I was so Buffy can get what she deserves.
Very well.
We will return your soul.
