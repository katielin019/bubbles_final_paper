{START OF EPISODE 0}
1 Are you sure this is a good idea?
It's a great idea.
So, you go to school here?
I used to.
It's nice.
Gets better.
Come on.
Wow.
Pretty cool, huh?
I could've fallen.
I would've caught you.
What was that?
What was what?
I heard a noise.
It's nothin'.
Maybe it's something.
Maybe it's some thing.
It's not funny.
Hello!
There's nobody here.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
OK.
I don't think you'll have any problem adjusting, Bunny.
Buffy.
Just remember our personal rules.
No gang colors, no fur, No hanging from the rafters in the cafeteria screaming: "Meat is murder"!
on Sloppy Joe day.
That became very popular last month.
I had to put my foot down.
- Proncipal Flutie - Betty?
I just want you to Buffy.
..
to know that I'm not gonna cause trouble.
There's not gonna be any incidents like at my old school.
I certainly hope not!
No.
I'm gonna have fun.
But I mean learning.
Fun with learning.
Don't worry.
I think you'll fit in just fine.
Willow!
You're so very much person I wanted to see.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
You know, I kinda have a problem with the math.
- Which part?
- The math.
Can you help me out third period?
Please be my study buddy.
- What's in it for me?
- A shiny nickel.
OK.
But you shouldn't be having a problem with it, Xander Mr. Worth says you never pay attention.
I pay attention.
Just not to him.
Willow.
Nice dress.
Good to know you've seen the softer side of Sears!
Hey, Cordelia.
Are you going to the Bronze tonight?
Not with you.
- But we're going, right?
- Who's playing?
- Dingoes Ate My Baby.
- They rock.
Grunge, wow!
What a new look!
I knew flannel's so over but I can never tell what's coming next!
I don't know about you, bit I'm scared!
Excuse me, was I talking to you?
Has any girl ever spoken to you of her own free will?
I don't think so.
You know, I've often wondered why that is.
Got a mirror?
Check back tomorrow.
I'll have that devastating comeback ready.
- Ooo!
- Oh!
Sorry about that.
That's OK.
I was totally phasing.
I'm trying to find the library.
- It's over there.
- Thanks.
I don't know you, do I?
I'm Buffy.
I'm new.
You're new and improved.
Oh!
Hey, you forgot your stake.
Hello!
Hi!
Is anybody here?
Oh!
Anybody's here.
Can I help you?
Textbooks.
I'm I'm looking for textbooks.
- Miss Summers?
- Good call.
Guess, I'm the only new kid, huh?
So, I'm taking Eurocentric history, and I'm gonna need I think I know what you're after.
That's not what I'm looking for.
- Are you sure?
- I'm way sure.
My mistake.
What is it you said you wanted?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr Barnes said I should help you get caught up, if you're having trouble Or I could not No, that'd be great.
History isn't my best subject.
I sort of lack a best subject.
I'm Buffy.
I know.
I'm Willow.
Good to meet you.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
I'm totally jamming on your dress.
Oh, no.
It's dorky.
I'm aware that it's dorky.
Not a jot.
It's lush.
Laura Ashley's definitely back.
- You think?
- She's back, and this time it's personal.
You see, that mated her with the Home Depot guy, - and that's how we got Martha Stewart.
- Wow.
Can I ask you?
What's up with the school librarian?
- You met Mr. Giles.
- Yeah.
Is he new?
He started a few weeks ago.
He used to be the curator of some British museum.
I don't know why he'd work here, except that we do have some√Ç  pretty im-portant collections.
- Hi.
I'm Cordelia.
- Hi.
I just thought we'd be a little welcoming committee.
Help you get adjusted, explain who to hang with, and why.
- Thanks.
- Quite frankly, when I saw those shoes I knew there was a beautiful bond of sisterhood between us.
Really!
I was very, very moved.
The new kid?
She seems kind of weird to me.
What kind of name is "Buffy"?
- Hey, Aphrodesia.
- Hey.
Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out and that's why she's starting in the middle of the semester.
- Neg!
- Pos.
She was starting fights!
Negly.
Well, I heard from Blue, and she said that she saw the transcript I've been trying to work this out.
And all I can figure is that you're building a really little fence.
Oh, this er no!
Actually it was for self-defence.
My last school was kind of interesting.
Well, it's pretty mellow here.
You'll be fine once you know your way around.
Ah, those guys?
The Housers.
They'd be genuine hard-core gangstas except for the upper-class white guy stigma.
Total wannabies, but they're OK.
Ah!
The Panga Inbreeds.
Dudes!
Surf's always up somewhere in the world?
Guess it's not that different on my side of the hill.
Well, try your hand at it.
OK, let's see um That would have to be the Theater Club.
Oh, well spotted.
What gave it away?
They're always way gesture-y.
What is the homework?
I didn't GET the homework!
And them?
Ah film club.
They spend their time deciding that every movie is an Existential meditation on Freudian sexuality.
- Even 'The Muppets Take Manhattan'?
- Especially 'The Muppets Take Manhattan'.
Ah the Dirty Girls.
Why do you call them Oh, wow.
They have 'views' on hygiene.
It's pretty intense.
- So which group are you affiliated with?
- Well, I've applied to a few, but doesn't look good.
Oh, I haven't heard back from the Dirty Girls.
Willow!
You've met Buffy, right?
She might be going to the Bronze tonight.
- Willow, what's wrong?
- You didn't hear?
Hear what?
In the women's locker room, they found someone.
And?
- I mean, someone - Dead.
- Dead?
- Way dead!
So not just a little dead then.
Don't you have an elsewhere to be?
- Are you, guys, sure?
- I heard it from Ms Ramsey.
- He was in a locker.
- I heard he used to go here.
- And that it was a gang thing.
- You think he was killed by someone?
No, I'm sure it was natural causes.
He crawled up in the locker and died of old age.
Um I gotta book .
See you guys later, okay?
O-kay?
Principal Flutie?
Er, Bambi?
Barbie?
er, Betty?
Wilma?
Buffy.
I am so sorry about this.
I know it's your first day.
I just want to say, we very seldom We almost never have dead kids stuffed in a locker.
- I have a very strict policy about that.
- So it's true?
Yeah.
I know it's hard.
Certainly, not the welcome I would've planned for you.
I know, you're upset, confused You probably got that thing like when you burp and you've got that vomity taste in your mouth.
I just want you to know that we're all here for you.
- If there's anything that you need.
- Can I look at the body?
Oh, great.
OK.
What's the sitch?
I'm sorry?
What's the sitch here?
You heard about the dead guy, right?
The dead guy in the locker?
Yes.
'Cause it's the weirdest thing.
He's got two little holes in his neck and all his blood's been drained.
Isn't that bizarre?
Aren't you just going 'oooh'?
I see.
Is he Will he rise again?
No, he wasn't changed.
Just dead.
Oh, dear.
I was afraid of this.
Well, I wasn't.
It's my first day!
I was afraid that I was gonna be behind on my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair.
I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus and I don't care.
Then why are you here?
To tell you that I don't care.
Which I don't!
and have now told you So Bye!
- You cannot escape your destiny.
- Wanna bet?
Do you think it's coincidence, your being here?
It was fated.
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
Because you are the Slayer.
Into every generation a Slayer is born.
One girl in all the world.
A Chosen One.
Wow, you're gonna do the speech and everything.
One born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil, blah blah blah - I've heard it, OK?
- I don't understand this attitude.
You've accepted your duty, you've slain vampires before.
Well, I've both been there and done that.
And I'm moving on.
Growing as a person.
Watch it happen.
You have no idea what's going on, do you?
There's vampires?
Big deal.
You kill them.
You think vampires are the only threat we face here?
What do you mean?
There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Werewolves.
Zombies.
Ghouls.
Incubi.
Succubi.
Everything you've ever dreaded under your bed but told yourself couldn't be by the light of day.
They're all real.
What, you're, like, sent away for the Time-Life series?
Yes.
- D'you get the free phone?
- The calendar.
Cool!
Zombies, huh?
OK.
First of all, I'm a vampire slayer.
And secondly, I'm retired.
- But your work is not finished.
- My work?
I'm sixteen!
I don't have work.
I have homework.
And you haven't been properly trained.
Which is why you're here.
Yes.
I - I'm a Watcher.
And a Watcher serves by finding the Slayer, leading her on her path.
It is my destiny to guide you.
Yeah, well, the last guy they sent to 'guide' me you should see what happened to him.
Yes, I know all about it.
You don't know anything about it.
You don't know what it's like.
I was happy.
I was Cindy Lou Who just coasting through my life when vampires - which are only supposed to be in cheesy movies - start killing people.
People I know.
And I find out I'm the Slayer, the only one in the world, and I gotta stop them.
And I do.
I train.
I hunt.
It becomes my whole life.
I can do things no other kid can do and actually that's fairly lush, I'm kinda into that.
So I kill the vampires.
Yay me.
And when it's all over, what's left?
My grades are the suck.
My social life has achieved leper stage.
And I get thrown out of school for causing trouble.
Not exactly a medal and a book deal, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I-I do.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
Like anybody else.
But you're not, are you?
Well, I mean to be.
O-kay - Are you the new girl?
- Yeah.
Hey!
I'm in line with you here, right?
Sure.
I'm psyched you came.
Is the band good?
Well, they don't know any actual chords yet but they have really big amps.
But it's always a good time, you know.
Yeah.
It seems normal.
A normal thing to do.
Er yeah?
Well, I mean everyone comes here, right?
So, you didn't do normal things at your old school?
Oh, sure.
Only.
Exclusively.
You know, everyday stuff.
Homework, student council, football team You were on the football team?
No!
I ch So, is Willow coming tonight?
Oh, I saw her sneaking on campus with some guy.
Willow has a boyfriend?
She does tonight.
I didn't know the guy.
So, you didn't have any extra-curricular choices - What was he like?
- Who?
- Willow's friend.
- Oh, erm, kind of - Pale?
- Yeah.
What was he wearing?
Erm er a jacket.
No.
What was it like?
You know, was it outdated at all, some old style?
You're really caring about this outfit!
Um Yeah.
But it was pretty striking.
You know, sleeves rolled up, collar, very Lionel Ritchie.
I mean, who's still sporting that look?
This is nice.
I- I don't usually do this sort of thing.
I don't usually get asked.
But I'm having a good time, though.
Where did you say you went to school?
Crossroads.
So Time for some kissing, huh?
Relax.
Oh, we probably shouldn't even be here.
Especially after what happened to that poor boy.
He had it coming.
What do you mean?
Coming up here alone, at night.
With a complete stranger.
What kind of an idiot would do a thing like that?
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna snuggle?
Hey!
Wait up!
Where would they be?
Buffy, uh, what's the sitch?
You might need this.
This wouldn't by any chance be a vampire issue?
The auditorium.
I'll try it round back!
All right.
Get your hands off of her.
Ooh.
Seconds.
So what is it with vampires and clothes?
You always think the march of fashion stopped dead the day you did.
It really is such a giveaway.
You know, you really shouldn't be here.
A vampire, all alone at night.
It just isn't safe.
You've got me wrong.
Oh, my bad.
You're not a vampire?
I'm not alone.
Oops.
I-I don't suppose you'd be sweeties and attack me one at a time?
- You watch too many movies.
- You can never watch too many movies.
Oh.
Ow.
That was my favourite spine.
Buffy!
Get Willow out of here!
She's hardly bit, she'll be all right!
Heads up!
- Can you walk?
- Oh.
Mom was right about boys.
Ow!
I'll go get help.
Xander, do you usually carry a purse?
Ugh, God, I hate leftovers.
See what happens when you roughhouse?
I don't like to hit girls that I'm afraid of.
Who are you?
I'm the slayer.
A slayer!
- Wait!
- I'll call you!
Better face facts.
You've run out of time.
You've run out of friends.
And nobody likes your outfit.
Freeze!
I know how to use this.
I think.
OK.
Buffy?
Be careful, you guys.
There's some Your friend can't help you now!
Hold that thought.
I'm really sorry about all this.
That's okay.
It's kind of a destiny thing.
So.
What does a Vampire Slayer do, exactly?
Hey, look at them.
Well, it seems Buffy's found her own level.
I can't believe we were almost nice to her.
I know.
I'm not saying you didn't do well.
Wait - now I am.
You didn't do well.
You, you stunk up the place.
What, are you kidding?
She was huge!
She had the moves, this Crane Technique√Ç  And she saved my life.
Which I'm for.
If she'd been a minute later, you'd be dead.
Or worse.
And you revealed yourself.
- And you, you let one of them get away - You know, are you sure you're wearing enough?
'Cause we might get a cloud today.
I cannot believe that the fate of the world may well be in the hands of this teen thing.
Relax.
The world's in beauty hands.
Trust me!
Listen, theres music in the air I heard your voice, coming from somewhere Based on the transcript by: Stormwreath
{END OF EPISODE 0}{START OF EPISODE 1}
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- It's a great idea.
Now, come on.
- Do you go to school here?
- I used to.
On top of the gym it's so cool.
You can see the whole town.
don't want to go up there.
Oh, you can't wait, huh?
We're just gonna get in trouble.
Yeah, you can count on it.
- What was that?
- What was what?
- I heard a noise.
- It's nothing.
Uh maybe it's something.
- Well, maybe it's some thing.
- It's not funny.
Hello?
There's nobody here.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
OK.
Buffy?
- I'm up, Mom.
- Don't wanna be late for your first day.
No.
Wouldn't want that.
Have a good time.
I know you're gonna make friends right away.
Just think positive.
And honey?
- Try not to get kicked out.
- I promise.
OK.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Whoa!
Excuse me.
An accident.
Stop!
Please move.
Whoa!
Excuse me.
Oh, God!
OK, I feel good.
Willow!
You're so very much the person I wanted to see.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I kinda had a problem with the math.
- Uh, which part?
- The math.
Can you help me out tonight?
Please be my study buddy.
- Well, what's in it for me?
- A shiny nickel.
OK.
Do you have "Theories in Trig"?
You should check it out.
Check it out?
- From the library.
Where the books live.
- I'm there.
See?
I wanna change.
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, Jesse!
What's what?
- New girl!
- That's right.
I saw her.
- Pretty much a hottie.
- I heard someone was transferring.
- So, tell.
- Tell what?
What's the sitch?
What do you know about her?
- New girl.
Buffy Summers.
Sophomore.
Late of Hemery High in Los Angeles.
Interesting record.
Quite a career.
Welcome to Sunnydale.
A clean slate, Buffy.
That's what you get here.
What's past is past.
We're not interested in what it says on a piece of paper.
Even if it says - Mr Flutie - Kids here are free to call me Bob.
- Bob - But they don't.
I know my transcripts are a little colourful.
We're not caring about that.
Do you think, uh, colourful is the word?
Not, uh dismal?
- It wasn't that bad.
- You burned down the gym.
I did.
I really did, but you're not seeing the big picture here.
I mean, that gym was full of vampi Asbestos.
Buffy.
Don't worry.
Any other school, they might say "Watch your step," or "We'll be watching you".
But that's just not the way here.
We want to service your needs and help you to respect our needs.
And if your needs and our needs don't mesh Ooh!
Oh, sorry!
It's OK.
Can I have you?
Duh!
Can I help you?
- Thanks.
- I don't know you, do I?
- I'm Buffy.
I'm new.
- Xander ..
is is me.
Hi.
Oh, thanks!
Well, um, maybe I'll see you around.
Maybe at school, since we both go there.
Great!
It was nice to meet you.
"We both go to school".
Very suave.
Very not pathetic.
Oh!
Hey!
Hey!
You forgot your stake.
It's estimated that about 25 million people died in that one four-year span.
But the fun part of the Black Plague is that it originated in Europe how?
As an early form of germ warfare.
If you'll look at the map on page 63, you can trace the spread of the disease - Into Rome and then north - Thanks.
And this popular plague led to what social changes?
Steve?
- Hi, I'm Cordelia.
- I'm Buffy.
If you're looking for your own textbook, there's a few in the library.
- Great.
Thanks.
Where would that be?
- I'll show you.
Come on.
- So, you're from Hemery, right?
In LA?
- Yeah.
Oh, I would kill to live in LA.
That close to that many shoes!
You'll be OK here.
If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time.
Of course, we do have to test your coolness factor.
You're from LA, so you can skip the written, but, let's see Vamp nail polish?
Um over?
So over.
James Spader?
He needs to call me!
- Frappuchinos?
- Trendy but tasty.
- John Tesh?
- The Devil.
That was pretty much a gimme, but you passed!
Oh, goody!
Willow!
Nice dress!
Good to know you've seen the softer side of Sears.
Oh, well, my mom picked it out.
No wonder you're such a guy-magnet.
Are you done?
If you wanna fit in here, the first rule is "know your losers".
Once you can identify them all by sight, they're a lot easier to avoid.
If you're not swamped with catching up, come by the Bronze tonight.
- The who?
- The Bronze.
The only club worth going to.
They let anybody in, but it's still the scene.
It's in the bad part of town.
- Where's that?
- Half a block from the good part.
We don't have a whole lot of town here.
But you should show.
Well, I'll try.
Uh, thanks.
Good.
So, um, I'll see you at gym, and you can tell me everything there is to know about you.
Great!
Oh, that sounds like fun!
Hello?
Is anybody here?
- Oh!
Anybody's here.
- Can I help you?
I was looking for some, well, books.
I'm new.
Miss Summers?
Good call.
I guess I'm the only new kid, huh?
I'm Mr Giles.
The librarian.
I was told you were coming.
Great.
So, um, I'm gonna need "Perspectives on 20th-Century" I know what you're after.
That's not what I'm looking for.
- Are you sure?
- I'm way sure.
My mistake.
So, what is it you said?
The new kid?
She seems weird to me.
And what kind of name is Buffy?
- Hey, Aphrodisia.
- Hey!
The chatter in the caff is she got kicked out and that's why her mom had to get a new job.
- Neg.
- Pos.
She was starting fights!
- Neg-ly!
- Well, I heard it from Blue, and she said Uh, hi.
- Willow, right?
- Why?
I mean, hi.
Did you want me to move?
Why don't we start with "Hi, I'm Buffy"?
And then let's segue directly into me asking you for a favour.
It involves hanging out with me for a while.
But aren't you hanging out with Cordelia?
- I can't do both?
- Not legally.
Look, I really wanna get by here.
New school and Cordelia's been really nice to me, anyway.
But, I have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes and - I heard you're the one to help me catch up.
- I could totally help you out!
If you have sixth period free, we could meet in the library.
Or not.
We could meet someplace quieter.
Louder.
That place gives me the wiggins.
It has that effect on most kids.
But I love it.
It's a great collection.
The new librarian is really cool.
- He's new?
- Yeah, he just started.
He was a curator at some British museum.
Or The British Museum.
I'm not sure.
He knows everything.
He brought all these historical volumes - And am I the single dullest person alive?
- Not at all.
You guys busy?
Are we interrupting?
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, there.
This is Jesse, and that's Xander.
Me and Buffy go way back.
Old friends.
Very close.
Then there was our estrangement where we both grew as people, but now here we are like old times.
I'm quite moved.
Is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?
No.
It's, uh, it's not you.
Well, it's nice to meet you guys.
I think.
We wanted to welcome you, make you feel at home.
- Unless you have a scary home.
- And to return this.
The only thing I could think is that you're building a really little fence.
Uh no, um Actually, it was for self-defence.
Everyone has them in LA.
Pepper spray is just so pass√©.
What do you do for fun?
What do you look for in a man?
If you have any dark secrets you'd like us to publish Gee, everyone wants to know about me.
How keen.
Not much goes on in a town like Sunnydale.
You're pretty big news.
I'm not.
Really.
- Are these guys bothering you?
- Uh, no!
She's not hanging out with us.
- Hey, Cordelia.
- Oh, please.
Sorry to interrupt your downward mobility, but you won't be meeting Coach Foster, the woman with the chest hair, because gym was cancelled due to the extreme dead guy in the locker.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
Some guy was stuffed in Aura's locker.
- Dead?
- Totally dead.
Way dead.
- Notjust a little dead?
- Don't you have an elsewhere to be?
If you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on - How did he die?
- I don't know.
- Well, were there any marks?
- Morbid much!
I didn't ask!
I gotta book.
I'II I'll see you guys later.
What's her deal?
Oh, great!
- OK, what's the sitch?
- Sorry?
You heard about the dead guy, right?
In the locker?
- Yes.
- Cos it's the weirdest thing.
He's got two little holes in his neck and all his blood's been drained.
Isn't that bizarre?
Aren't you just going "Oooh"?
- I was afraid of this.
- Well, I wasn't.
It's my first day.
I was afraid that I was gonna be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair.
I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus.
And I don't care.
Then why are you here?
To tell you that I don't care, which I don't, and have now told you.
So bye.
Is he will he rise again?
- Who?
- The boy.
- No.
He's just dead.
- Can you be sure?
To make you a vampire, they suck your blood and then you suck their blood.
It's like a whole big sucking thing.
Mostly, they're just gonna kill you.
- Why am I still talking to you?
- You have no idea what's going on, do you?
You think it's coincidence, your being here?
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
Because you are the Slayer.
"Into each generation, a slayer is born".
"One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One.
One born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires.
To stop the spread of evil".
I've heard it, OK?
I don't understand this attitude.
You've accepted your duty, slain vampires before.
I've been there and done that, and I'm moving on.
What do you know about this town?
It's two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus?
Dig a bit in the history of this place and you find a stream of fairly odd occurrences.
This whole area is a centre of mystical energy.
Things gravitate towards it that you might not find elsewhere.
- Like vampires.
- Like zombies.
Werewolves.
Incubi.
Succubi.
Everything you dreaded was under your bed but told yourself couldn't be.
They're all real.
What?
You sent away for the Time-Life Series?
Um yes.
- Did you get the free phone?
- The calendar.
Cool!
But OK, first of all, I'm a vampire slayer.
And secondly, I'm retired.
- Hey, I know!
Why don't you kill 'em?
- I'm a watcher.
I haven't the skill.
Oh, come on!
A stake through the heart it's like falling off a log.
- A slayer slays.
A watcher - Watches?
Yes.
No!
He trains her.
He prepares her.
Prepares me for what?
For getting kicked out of school?
For losing all of my friends?
For spending my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because I might endanger them?
Go ahead.
Prepare me.
Damn!
What?
- It's getting worse.
- What's getting worse?
The influx of the undead.
It's been building for years.
There's a reason why you're here now.
Because now is the time my mom moved here.
Something is coming.
Something Something is gonna happen here.
Soon.
Gee, can you vague that up for me?
The signs, as far as I can tell, point to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon.
Days, possibly less.
Oh, come on!
This is Sunnydale.
How bad an evil can there be here?
The sleeper will wake.
The sleeper will wake.
The sleeper will wake.
The sleeper will wake.
And the world will bleed.
Amen!
Hi!
I'm an enormous slut!
Hello.
Would you like a copy of "The Watchtower"?
I used to be so good at this.
- Hi, hon.
- Hey!
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah.
I'm going to a club.
- Oh.
Will there be boys there?
- No, Mom.
It's a nun club!
- Well, just be careful.
- I will.
You know, I think we can make it work here.
I've got my positive energy flowing.
I'm gonna get the gallery on its feet.
- We may have found a space today.
- That's great.
That school is a very nurturing environment, which is what you need.
- Well, actually - Oh, not too nurturing.
I know.
You're 16.
I've read all about the dangers of over-nurturing.
It's hard.
New town and everything.
It is for me, too.
I'm trying to make it work.
I'm going to make it work.
- I know.
- You're a good girl, Buffy.
You just fell in with the wrong crowd.
But that is all behind us now.
It is.
From now on, I am only going to hang out with the living.
I mean lively people.
OK.
You have fun.
- Is there a problem, ma'am?
- Yeah, there's a problem.
Why are you following me?
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry.
I don't bite.
The truth is, I thought you'd be taller.
Or bigger muscles and all that.
You're pretty spry, though.
- What do you want?
- The same thing you do.
OK What do I want?
To kill 'em.
To kill 'em all.
Incorrect, but you do get this watch and a year's supply of Turtle Wax.
- What I want is to be left alone!
- Do you think that's an option any more?
You're standing at the mouth of Hell.
And it's about to open.
Don't turn your back on this.
- You've gotta be ready.
- What for?
For the Harvest.
Who are you?
Let's just say I'm a friend.
Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a friend.
I didn't say I was yours.
What's up?
Hey.
- Hey!
- Oh, hi!
Hi!
- Are you here with someone?
- No.
I'm just here.
- I thought Xander was gonna show up.
- Oh!
Are you guys going out?
No, we're just friends.
We used to go out, but we broke up.
- How come?
- He stole my Barbie.
Oh, we were five.
- I don't actually date a whole lot lately.
- Why not?
Well, when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or or witty, or at all.
I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.
- It's not that bad.
- No, it is.
I thinks boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.
- You really haven't been dating lately.
- It's probably easy for you.
Yeah.
Real easy.
I mean, you don't seem too shy.
Well, my philosophy Do you want to hear it?
- Yeah, I do.
- Life is short.
- "Life is short".
- Not original, I'll grant you, but it's true.
Why waste time being shy and worrying about some guy laughing at you?
Seize the moment, cos tomorrow you might be dead.
Oh, that's nice!
Um, I'll be back in a minute.
Oh, that's that's OK.
You don't have to come back.
I'll be back in a minute.
"Seize the moment".
Like partying with students?
Ain't that skanky?
Oh, right!
This is me having fun.
Watching "clown hair" prance about is hardly my idea of a party.
I'd rather be at home with a cup of Bovril and a good book.
You need a personality.
This is a perfect breeding ground for vampires.
It's dark, crowded I knew you would show up.
I have to make you understand.
That the Harvest is coming.
I know.
Your friend told me.
- What did you say?
- The Harvest.
Does that mean something to you?
Cos I'm drawing a blank.
I'm not sure.
Who told you this?
This guy.
Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way.
I figured you two were buds.
No.
The Harvest Did he say anything else?
Something about the "mouth of Hell".
I really didn't like him.
Look at them.
Throwing themselves about.
Unaware of the danger that surrounds them.
- Lucky them.
- Or perhaps you're right.
Perhaps there is no trouble coming.
The signs could be wrong.
It's not as though you've been having the nightmares.
Mom doesn't get out of bed.
The doctor says it's Epstein-Barr.
I'm, like, "It's chronic hepatitis or at least chronic fatigue syndrome".
I mean, nobody cool has Epstein-Barr any more.
- Hey, Cordelia!
- Oh, yea, it's my stalker!
- You look you look great.
- I'm glad we had this little chat.
Listen, you know, wanna dance?
You know?
- With you?
- Well, uh, yeah.
Well, uh, no!
Come on, guys.
Fine.
Plenty other fish in the sea.
Oh, yeah, I'm on the prowl!
Witness me prowling!
I didn't say I'd never slay another vampire.
I don't have fluffy bunny feelings for them.
I'm just not gonna get extracurricular with it.
If I see one, sure Will you be ready?
There's so much you don't know about them, about your own powers.
A vampire appears to be normal until the feed is upon them.
Only then do they reveal their true demonic visage.
You're like a textbook with arms.
I know this.
The point is, a slayer should be able to see them anyway.
Without looking, without thinking.
Can you tell me if there's a vampire in this building?
- Maybe.
- You should know.
Even through this mass and this din, you should be able to sense them.
Well, try.
Reach out with your mind.
Hone your senses.
Focus until the energy washes over you, until you feel every particle of - There's one.
- Wh-where?
Right there.
Talking to that girl.
- You don't know - Oh, please!
Look at his jacket.
He's got the sleeves rolled up.
And the shirt?
Deal with that outfit for a moment.
- It's dated?
- It's carbon dated.
Trust me.
Only someone living underground would think that was still the look.
But you didn't hone.
Oh, no!
- Isn't that?
- Willow.
- What's she doing?
- Seizing the moment.
Cordelia!
God!
What is your childhood trauma?
!
Have you guys seen Willow?
Did she come by here?
Do you need to attack her with the stick?
Jeez!
Excuse me.
I have to call everyone I have ever met, right now.
That was quick.
Well done.
I need to go to the library.
- This Harvest thing - I didn't find them.
- The vampire is not dead?
- No, but my social life is on the critical list.
- So, what do we do?
- I'll take care of it.
- I need to come with you, yes?
- Don't worry.
One vampire I can handle.
So, um, what did you say your name was?
- Darla.
- Darla.
I haven't seen you around before.
- Are you from around here?
- No, but I have family here.
- Have I met them?
- You probably will.
Master.
- I am weak.
- Come the Harvest, you will be restored.
The Harvest.
We're almost there.
Soon you will be free.
I must be ready.
I need my strength.
- I've sent your servants to bring you food.
- Good.
- Luke?
- Yes?
Bring me something young.
Sure is dark.
- It's night.
- Well, that's a dark time.
Night.
Traditionally.
I still can't believe I've never seen you at school.
Do you have Mr Chomsky for history?
The ice-cream bar is this way.
It's past Hamilton Street.
I know a shortcut.
- Leaving already?
- Xander.
Have you seen Willow?
- Not tonight, no.
- She left with a guy.
We're talking about Willow?
Scoring at the Bronze!
Work it, girl!
No, I need to find her.
Where would he take her?
Why?
Oh, hey, I hope he's not a vampire, because then you might have to slay him.
Was there a school bulletin?
Was it in the newspaper?
Is there anyone in this town who doesn't know I'm the Slayer?
I know you think you're the Slayer, and the reason why Whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Just tell me - Where would Willow go?
You're serious.
We don't find her, and there's gonna be one more dead body in the morning.
OK, this this is nice and scary.
Are you sure this is faster?
Hey, you ever been in one of these?
No Thank you.
Come on.
What are you afraid of?
That wasn't funny.
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Is that what you think?
- Is this the best you could do?
- She's fresh.
Hardly enough to share.
Why didn't you bring your own?
- I did.
- Hey!
Wait up!
Oh, my God!
Jesse!
You know, you gave me a hickey.
- I got hungry on the way.
- Oh, Jesse, let's get outta here!
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
Leave us alone!
You're not going anywhere until we've fed!
Well, this is nice.
It's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows call it home!
Who the hell are you?
There's someone in this town who doesn't know already?
That's a relief.
Having a secret identity in this town is ajob of work.
- Buffy, we bail now, right?
- Not yet.
OK, first of all, what's with the outfit?
Live in the now, OK?
You look like DeBarge.
Now, we can do this the hard way, or Well, actually, there's just the hard way.
- That's fine with me.
- Are you sure?
This is not gonna be pretty.
We're talking violence, strong language, adult content - See what happens when you roughhouse?
- He was young and stupid.
- Xander, go!
- Don't go far.
You know, I just wanted to start over.
Be like everybody else.
Have some friends, you know, maybe a dog.
But no.
You had to come here.
- You couldn't go suck on some other town.
- Who are you?
Don't you know?
I don't care.
You were supposed to bring an offering for the Master.
We're almost at Harvest and you dally with this child.
We had someone.
But then she came.
She killed Thomas.
Luke she's strong.
You go.
I'll see if I can handle the little girl.
You're strong.
I'm stronger.
We'll get the police!
It's just a few blocks up!
- You're wasting my time.
- Hey!
I had other plans, too, OK?
You think you can stop me?
Stop us?
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
"And like a plague of boils, the race of Man covered the Earth".
"But on the third day of the newest light will come the Harvest and the blood of men will flow as wine when the Master will walk among them once more".
"The Earth will belong to the Old Ones".
"And Hell itself will come to town".
Amen.
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
No!
Get off!
Hey!
Xander!
- Xander, are you OK?
- Man, something hit me.
- Where's Jesse?
- I don't know.
They surrounded us.
- That girl took off with him.
- Which way?
I don't know.
Jesse This world is older than any of you know.
Contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin as a paradise.
For untold aeons, demons walked the Earth.
They made it their home.
Their, uh, their Hell.
But in time they lost their purchase on this reality.
The way was made for mortal animals.
For Man.
All that remains of the Old Ones are vestiges.
Certain magics.
Certain creatures.
- And vampires.
- This is where I have a problem.
See, because we're talking about vampires.
We're having a talk with vampires in it.
- Isn't that what we saw last night?
- No, those weren't vampires.
Those were just guys in need of a facial.
Or maybe they had rabies.
And that guy turning to dust?
Just a trick of light.
That's what I said the first time I saw a vampire.
Well, after I was done with the screaming part.
- Oh, I need to sit down.
- You are sitting down.
- Oh!
Good for me.
- So, vampires are demons?
The books tell that the last demon to leave this reality fed off a human.
Mixed their blood.
He was a human form possessed.
Infected by the demon's soul.
He bit another, and another.
And so they walked the Earth, feeding.
Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind.
Waiting for the animals to die out, and the Old Ones to return.
Move.
Is this for me?
An offering, Master.
He's a good one.
His blood is pure.
You've tasted it.
I'm your faithful dog.
You bring me scraps.
I didn't mean I have waited.
For three score years, I have waited.
While you come and go, I am stuck here.
Here in this house of worship.
My ascension is almost at hand.
Pray that when it comes I'm in a better mood.
Master, forgive me.
We had more offerings, but there was trouble.
A girl.
And there was a girl.
She fought well and she knew of our breed.
- It is possible that she may be - A slayer.
- A what?
- For as long as there have been vampires, there's been the Slayer.
One girl in all the world.
- He loves doing this part.
- All right.
The Slayer hunts vampires.
Buffy is a slayer.
Don't tell anyone.
- That's all the vampire information you need.
- Except how you kill them.
You don't.
I do.
- Jesse's my - My responsibility.
I let him get taken.
That's not true.
If you hadn't shown up, they would have taken us, too.
Anybody mind if I pass out?
- Breathe.
- Breathe.
Breathe.
This big guy Luke, he talked about an offering to the Master.
I don't know what or who, but if they weren't just feeding, Jesse may be alive.
I'll find him.
This may be the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?
And they'd believe us, of course.
We don't have to say vampires.
We could just say there's a a bad man.
They couldn't handle it.
They'd only come with guns.
You have no idea where they took Jesse?
Soon as they got clear of the graveyard, they could have just voom!
- They can fly?
- They can drive.
Oh.
I don't remember hearing a car.
Let's take an intuitive leap and say they went underground.
Vampires love sewer systems.
You can go anywhere in the town without catching rays.
But I didn't see any access there.
An electrical tunnel runs under the whole town.
If we have a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it might indicate a meeting place.
- We could go to the building commission.
- We so don't have time.
Uh, guys?
There may be another way.
A slayer.
Have you any proof?
- Only that she fought me and yet lives.
- Oh, very nearly proof enough.
I can't remember the last time that happened.
He caught me sleeping.
She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the Harvest.
- I would never let that happen.
- Don't worry about it.
I believe she'll come to us.
We have something she wants.
If she is a slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save him.
I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy.
Congratulations.
You've just been upgraded, to bait.
There it is.
- That runs under the graveyard.
- I don't see any access.
So, all the city plans are just open to the public?
Um well, in a way.
I sort of stumbled on to them when I accidentally decrypted the city council's security system.
- Someone's been naughty.
- There's nothing here.
It's useless!
I think you're being a bit hard on yourself.
You're the one that told me I wasn't prepared enough!
Understatement!
I was on top of everything, and then Luke came out of nowhere What?
He didn't come out of nowhere.
He came from behind me.
I was facing the entrance He came from behind me and didn't follow me out.
The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum!
The girl doubled back with Jesse after I got out.
- God!
I am so mentally challenged!
- What's the plan?
We saddle up?
There's no we, OK?
I'm the Slayer, and you're not.
- I knew you'd throw that back in my face.
- This is deeply dangerous.
I'm inadequate.
That's fine.
I'm less than a man.
Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place full of monsters, but I do wanna help.
- I need to.
- Well, then help me.
I've been researching this Harvest affair.
It's some sort of preordained massacre.
Rivers of blood.
Hell on Earth.
Quite charmless.
I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.
It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine.
That was a bit, British, wasn't it?
Welcome to the New World.
- I want you to go on the Net.
- Oh, sure.
I can do that.
Then I'm outta here.
If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.
Do I have to tell you to be careful?
- And where do we think we're going?
- We?
I. Me.
- We're not leaving school grounds, are we?
- No.
No!
I'm just admiring the fence.
You know, this is quality fencework.
If we were leaving school grounds on our second day, after getting kicked out of our old school You see where I'm going with this?
Mr Giles.
What?
He asked me to get a book for him, from the store.
I have a free period.
And I'm a big reader - was it in my transcripts?
- Mr Giles?
- Ask him.
Well, maybe that's how they do things in Britain.
They've got that royal family and all kinds of problems, but at Sunnydale nobody leaves campus while school's in session.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school.
Sensible girl with her feet on the ground.
- Murder, death, disaster.
What else?
- Paranormal.
Unexplained.
- Natural disasters.
- Earthquake, flood - Rain of toads.
- Right.
Rain of toads.
Will that be in the paper?
I'll do a computer search.
If it's there, it'll turn up.
- Anything to lead us to vampires.
- And l, in the meantime, will help - by standing around like an idiot.
- Not like an idiot.
Just standing.
Buffy doesn't want you getting hurt.
I don't want you getting hurt.
This is too much.
Yesterday my life's "Uh-oh!
Pop quiz".
Today, it's "rain of toads".
I know.
And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.
Nobody knows.
It's like we've got this big secret.
We do.
That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't.
Right.
- Look, maybe you should get to class.
- You mean we.
We should get to class.
Yeah.
Buffy'll be OK.
Whatever's down there, I think she can handle it.
- Yeah, I do too.
- So do I. - I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
- They really don't like me dropping in.
- Why not?
- They really don't like me.
How could that possibly be?
I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner or later.
Actually, I thought it was gonna be a little sooner.
Sorry you had to wait.
OK.
If you're gonna pop up with this cryptic wise-man act on a regular basis, - can you at least tell me your name?
- Angel.
Angel.
That's a pretty name.
Don't go down there.
Deal with my going.
You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk.
Tonight is the Harvest.
Unless you can prevent it, the Master walks.
Well, if this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't you stop it?
Cos I'm afraid.
They'll be expecting you.
I've got a friend down there.
Or at least a potential friend.
Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.
When you hit the tunnels, head east towards the school.
That's where you'll find them.
You gonna wish me luck?
Good luck.
- Xander, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.
- Well, you're - I couldn't sit at home and do nothing.
I understand.
Now go away.
- No!
- Xander, you'll have to!
Jesse's my bud.
If I can help him out, that's what I gotta do.
Besides, it's this or chem class.
OK, so crosses, garlic, stake through the heart.
- That'll get it done.
- Cool!
Of course, I don't have any of those things.
Good thinking.
The part of my brain that would tell me to bring it is busy telling me not to come here.
- I have this, though.
- Turn that off!
OK, OK!
- So, what else?
- What else what?
- For vampire slayage.
- Oh, fire, beheading, sunlight, holy water.
- The usual.
- You've done some beheading in your time?
Oh, yeah.
One time I was pinned down by this guy that played left tackle for varsity.
Well, he used to before he was a vampire.
Anyway, he had this really thick neck, and all I had was this little Exacto knife.
You're not loving this story.
No, actually, I find it oddly comforting.
"For they will gather and be gathered".
"From the Vessel pours life".
Pours life "On the night of the crescent moon, the first past the solstice, it will come".
Of course.
That's tonight.
No!
It's supposed to find the syntax and match it!
- Or wait - Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
No.
We're going to the other cool place in Sunnydale.
Of course we're going to the Bronze.
Friday night?
No cover?
But you should have been there last night, cos I ran into Buffy.
And could she be any weirder?
She attacked me!
Do you believe it?
I think we did this part wrong.
Why do we have to devise these programs?
Isn't that what nerds do?
What'd she do?
She's doing something else.
OK.
And then "pattern run", right?
Or "go to end".
That's it!
Maybe.
So anyway, I come out of the bathroom and she comes running at me, screaming, with a stick, "I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you"!
I swear!
- Who?
- Buffy.
- The new girl.
- What's her deal?
- She's crazed.
- Did you hear about her old school?
Booted.
- Well, I exhibit no surprise.
- Why was she kicked out?
- Because she's a psycho loony.
- No, she's not.
What?
She's not a psycho.
You don't even know her.
Excuse me?
Who gave you permission to exist?
Do I horn in on your private discussions?
No.
Why?
Because you're boring.
OK, I think the program's done.
Finally the nightmare ends!
OK, so how do we save it?
- Deliver.
- Deliver?
Where's that?
Oh!
- They're close.
- How can you tell?
No more rats.
- Jesse!
- Oh, no!
Jesse?
- Xander!
- Jesse, man.
Are you OK?
I am not OK on an epic scale.
We gotta get outta here.
- It's cool.
Buffy's a superhero.
- Hold on.
Do you think anyone heard that?
They knew you were gonna come.
They said that I was the bait.
Oh, great.
Now you tell us.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- Do you know another way out?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Come on.
Wait!
Wait!
They brought me through here.
There should be a way up.
I hope.
- This isn't the way out.
- We can't fight our way back.
- What do we do?
- I've got an idea.
You can die.
- Jesse, man.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry?
I feel good, Xander.
I feel strong.
I'm connected to everything!
- I can hear the worms in the earth.
- That's a plus.
I know what the Master wants.
I'll serve his purpose.
That means you die.
- And I feed.
- Xander, the cross!
Jesse, man, we're buds.
Don't you remember?
- You're like a shadow to me now.
- Then get outta my face.
Help me!
- We need to get out of here.
- There is no out of here.
Up there!
Go!
Xander, pull.
She escaped?
She walks free when I should be drinking her heart's blood right now!
- Careless.
- Master, we had her trapped.
Oh.
Are you going to make excuses?
You are all weak.
It has been too long since you have faced a slayer.
It is no matter to me.
She will not stop the Harvest.
It just means there'll be someone worth killing when I reach the surface.
- Is Luke ready?
- He waits.
It's time.
Bring him to me.
Uh, Collin.
You failed me.
Tell me you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- There.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Hold on.
You've got something in your eye.
- Buffy?
- It's just me.
- So, there's no word?
- Uh, not as yet, no.
Well, I'm sure they're great.
- Did you find anything of interest?
- I think maybe.
I surfed through old newspapers around the time of that earthquake back in '37.
For several months before, there were a rash of murders.
Great!
I mean, uh, well, not great in a good way.
Uh go on.
Well, they sound like the kind you were looking for.
Throats, blood It's all coming together.
I rather wish it weren't.
My blood is your blood.
My soul is your soul.
My body is your instrument.
On this most hallowed night, we are as one.
Luke is the Vessel.
Every soul he takes will feed me.
And their souls will grant me the strength to free myself.
Tonight I shall walk the Earth, and the stars themselves will hide!
- Did you find Jesse?
- Yeah.
- Was he dead?
- Worse.
I'm sorry, Willow, but we were too late.
- And they were waiting for us.
- At least you two are OK.
I don't like vampires.
I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
So, Giles, got anything that could make this day any worse?
- How about the end of the world?
- Knew I could count on you.
This is what we know: Some 60 years ago, a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, notjust to feed.
- He came cos this town's a mystical whoozit.
- Yes.
The Spanish who first settled here called it "Boca del Infierno".
Roughly translated "Hellmouth".
It's a sort of, um portal between this reality and the next.
- This vampire hoped to open it.
- Bring the demons back.
- End of the world.
- But he blew it.
Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed half the town, and him too.
You see, opening dimensional portals is a tricky business.
Odds are he got himself stuck, rather like a cork in a bottle.
- And this Harvest thing is to get him out.
- It comes once in a century, on this night.
The Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds.
Enough power to break free and open the portal.
The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol.
So, I dust anyone sporting that symbol, and no Harvest.
- Simply put, yes.
- Where is this get-together being held?
- There are a number of possibilities.
- They'll go to the Bronze.
- Are you sure?
- All those tasty young morsels everywhere?
- That's where Jesse's gonna be.
Trust me.
- Then we should get there.
- The sun will be down before long.
- I gotta make a stop.
- What for?
- Supplies.
Buffy?
- Mom!
- You're going out?
- I have to.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.
I was really quiet.
It's happening again, isn't it?
I got a call from your new principal.
- You missed some classes today.
- I was running an errand.
We haven't unpacked, and I'm getting calls from the principal.
I promise, it is not gonna be like before.
But I have to go.
- No.
- Mom!
The tapes all say I should get used to saying it.
No.
This is really, really important!
I know.
If you don't go out, it'll be the end of the world.
Everything is life or death when you're a 16-year-old girl.
- I don't have time - You have all the time in the world.
You're not going anywhere.
Now, if you wanna stay up here and sulk, I won't hold it against you.
But if you wanna come down, I'll make us some dinner.
Senior boys are the only way to go.
Guys from our grade?
Forget about it.
They're children, you know?
Like Jesse.
Did you see him last night?
Following me around like a little puppy dog.
You just wanna put him to sleep.
But senior boys?
They have mystery.
They have What's the word I'm searching for?
Cars.
I just am not the type to settle, you know?
It's like when I go shopping.
I have to have the most expensive thing.
Not because it's expensive, - but because it costs more.
- You know Hello?
Miss Motor-Mouth?
Can I get a sentence finished?
Oh, I love this song!
Come on!
What do you want?
Hey!
Hello?
Caveman-brain, what are you doing?
Shut up.
Well, just one dance.
You need ID.
Hey!
Nobody gets inside until I get some sorta Get inside.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cause for alarm.
Actually, there is cause for alarm.
It just won't do any good.
I thought there was no band tonight.
This is a glorious night!
It is also the last one any of you shall ever see.
Bring me the first.
What do you guys want, man, huh?
You want money?
Hey, what's wrong with your faces?
Watch me, people.
Fear is like an elixir.
It's almost like blood.
Next!
- It's locked!
- We're too late!
- I didn't know I'd get grounded!
- Can you break it?
No, not that thing.
You try the back entrance and I'll find my own way.
- Right.
Come on.
- Uh, wait, guys.
Here.
You get the exit cleared and the people out.
That's all.
Don't go Wild Bunch on me.
Uh see you inside, then.
- No joy.
- We have to get in there - before Jesse does something stupid.
- You listen to me.
Jesse is dead.
You have to remember that when you see him, you're not looking at your friend.
You're looking at the thing that killed him.
Almost free.
Give me more!
- This one's mine!
- They're all for the Master.
I don't get one?
I can feel the Master's strength growing!
I feel him rising!
Every soul brings him closer!
I need another!
The Vessel.
Tonight is his ascension!
Tonight will be history at its end!
Yours is a glorious sacrifice, degradation most holy.
What?
No volunteers?
Here's a pretty one.
No!
I'm sorry!
Were you in the middle of something?
- You!
- You didn't think I'd miss this.
Did you?
- I hoped you'd come.
- Be right down.
OK, Vessel boy.
- You want blood?
- I want yours.
Only yours.
Works for me.
Hurry!
Come on out, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Come on, let's go!
Come on!
This way!
Heads up.
Hold still!
- You're not making this easy.
- Jesse, man.
Don't make me do it.
Buddy!
I always wanted to kill a slayer.
One at a time!
Quickly!
We're gonna have to open the front as well.
Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in there.
OK.
Let's deal with this.
Jesse was a loser who couldn't get a date with anyone in the sighted community.
Look at me.
I'm a new man!
Master, taste of this and be free.
How'd it taste?
Get off of him!
All right.
Put me out of my misery.
You don't have the gu You forget.
Metal can't hurt me.
There's something you forgot about, too.
Sunrise.
It's in about nine hours, moron.
She did it.
I'll be damned.
I take it it's over.
Did we win?
Well, we averted the apocalypse.
I'd give us points for that.
One thing's for sure.
Nothing's ever gonna be the same.
Wait up!
I heard it was rival gangs, fighting for turf.
But all I can tell you is, they were ugly.
And Buffy, like, knew them.
Which is just too weird.
I don't even remember much, but it was a freak show.
- God, I wish I'd been there.
- You should have been.
It was so crazy.
- What were you expecting?
- I don't know.
Something.
- I mean, the dead rose.
At least an assembly.
- People tend to rationalise what they can and forget what they can't.
- Believe me.
I've seen it happen.
- Well, I'll never forget it.
- Good.
Next time you'll be prepared.
- Next time?
Next time is why?
We prevented the Master from opening the mouth of Hell, but he might not stop trying.
- The fun is just beginning.
- More vampires?
Not just vampires.
The next threat we face - may be something quite different.
- I can hardly wait.
We are at the centre of a mystical convergence here.
We may, in fact, stand between the Earth and its total destruction.
I gotta look on the bright side.
Maybe I can get kicked out of school.
That's a plan.
A lot of schools aren't on Hell mouths.
You could blow something up.
They're strict about that.
I was thinking of a more subtle approach, you know.
Like excessive not studying.
The Earth is doomed!
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
This is madness.
What can you have been thinking?
You are the Slayer.
Lives depend upon you.
I make allowances for your youth, but I expect a certain amount of responsibility.
Instead of which, you enslave yourself to this cult?
- You don't like the colour?
- I Do you, erm do you ignore everything I say, as a rule?
No.
I believe that's your trick.
I told you, I'm trying out for the cheerleading squad.
You have a sacred birthright, Buffy.
You were chosen to destroy vampires, not to wave pompoms at people.
And as the Watcher, I forbid it.
And you'll be stopping me how?
Well, I By appealing to your common sense, if such a creature exists.
I will still have time to fight the forces of evil, OK?
I just wanna have a life.
I wanna do something normal.
Something safe.
Giles didn't approve, huh?
He totally lost his water.
We haven't seen a vampire in over a week.
- He could get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
- We're behind you.
People scoff at things like school spirit, but look at these girls giving their all like this!
Ooh, stretchy!
Where was I?
Pretending to see scantily clad girls in revealing postures as a spiritual experience.
Who said I was pretending?
- Hey!
Here's a good-luck thing for try-outs.
- What's this?
- What's that?
- Oh, how sweet.
"Yours, always".
It came that way.
Really.
They all said that.
Just look at that Amber.
- Who does she think she is?
A Laker Girl?
- I heard she turned them down.
OK, listen up.
Let's begin with Amber Grove.
- If you're not auditioning, move off the floor.
- Amy!
Hi.
Hi!
I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader.
You lost a lot of weight.
Had to.
- Do you know Buffy?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How I hate this.
"Let me count the ways".
She trained with Benson.
He's one of the best coaches money can buy.
- They have cheerleading coaches?
- Oh, yeah!
Don't you have?
I train with my mom - three hours in the morning, three at night.
Hm.
That much quality time with my mom would lead to some quality matricide.
Yeah Well, I know it's hokey, but she's really great.
What the?
That girl's on fire!
Enough of the hyperbole!
It's OK.
It's OK.
You're gonna be OK!
God!
I've been slaying vampires for over a year, and I have seen some pretty cringeworthy things, but - nobody's hands ever got toasted before.
- I imagine not.
- So, this isn't a vampire problem.
- No.
But it is funky, right?
Not of the norm?
Quite.
Spontaneous human combustion is rare and scientifically unexplainable.
There have been cases for hundreds of years.
Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.
That's all that would have been left without Buffy.
So we have no idea what caused this?
- That's a comfort!
- That's the thrill of living on the Hellmouth.
There's a veritable cornucopia of fiends and devils and ghouls to engage.
Pardon me for finding the glass half full.
Any common denominators in cases of spontaneous combustion?
Er, rage.
In most cases, the person who combusted was terribly angry, or or upset.
So maybe Amber's got this power to make herself be on fire.
- It's like the Human Torch, only it hurts.
- I'll get the skinny on Amber.
Find out if she's had colourful episodes before.
That means hacking into the school's computer system.
Something I can do.
- I'll ask around.
- Don't get involved.
What do you mean?
We're a team.
Aren't we a team?
Yeah.
You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes.
I just don't like putting you guys in danger.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Then I hide until it goes away.
OK.
Just walk softly, at least until we know a little more.
What if Amber isn't causing this herself?
Well, then we have to determine who or what did.
And, er, deal with it accordingly.
- Hey!
- Hi.
How was school?
Mm.
A reverentjoy!
- What's all this?
- It's for the tribal art display.
Cool!
- We had try-outs today.
- Oh, great.
How'd it go?
I didn't actually get to try out.
There was an accident.
- Fierce competition, though.
- I know you'll do fine.
Keep on pluggin'.
Just have to get back on the horse.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
- What was I trying out for?
- Oh, uh ..
some activity?
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
I'm distracted.
I've got a lot of inventory to go through here.
This is my gallery's first major show.
You know, it might not physically kill you to give me a hand here.
- It was cheerleading.
- Oh, good!
I'm glad you're taking that up again.
It'll keep you out of trouble.
- I'm not in trouble.
- No, not yet.
I mean, you stopped cheerleading just before the trouble.
So it's good you're going back.
- Oh, dear.
- What?
- A fertility statue.
You don't need to see it.
- You know, there's this girl, Amy, and she trains with her mom, like, three hours a day.
- Uh-huh?
- Sounds like her mom's pretty into it.
Sounds like her mom doesn't have a lot to do.
Jeepers!
Despite the terrible thing that happened, we still have to pick new cheerleaders.
If you make the team, you'll find your names posted in the quad after lunch.
Let's begin with group performance.
Why do my hands sweat when I get nervous?
Don't worry.
You'll do great.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Sunnydale!
Sunnydale!
We never fail!
We never fail!
Jump and shoot, swish and score, the other team is such a bore.
Yeah!
You saw that, right?
That wasn't me.
You saw that, right?
Right?
- That's my mom.
- No?
Catherine Madison.
Get down with your bad self!
Her nickname was "Catherine the Great".
She made that team Tri-County Champions.
You know, no one's ever done that before.
Or since.
She and my dad were Homecoming King and Queen.
- They got married after graduation.
- That's kinda romantic.
Well, he was a big loser.
Never made any money.
Ran off with Miss Trailer Trash when I was 12.
OK.
That part's less romantic.
- My folks split up, too.
- Drag, huh?
He left my mom with nothing.
She put herself through cosmetology school.
Bought me everything I ever wanted.
And never once gained a single pound.
She sounds really great, Amy.
But, um it doesn't mean you need to lock step as far as this cheerleading thing.
She was the best.
And I can't get my body to move like hers.
I choked in there so bad!
No, Amy, you did fine.
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Wait!
No, uh Hey, Amy!
- Is she OK?
- Oh, she's wiggin' about her mom.
The big "cheer queen".
- Yeah.
Her mom's kinda - Nazi-like?
Heil.
If she gains an ounce, she padlocks the fridge and only eats broth.
So, Mommy dearest is really Mommy dearest?
There's a bitter streak.
But Amy's nice.
We used to hang in junior high.
When her mom was on a broth kick, Amy'd come to my house and we'd eat brownies.
Hm!
Hey, any word on Amber?
Nothing thrilling.
Average student, got detention once for smoking.
Regular smoking, with a cigarette - not, like, being smoky.
- Hm.
- All pretty normal.
So we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
Maybe nothing will.
I have a dream.
It's me on the cheerleading squad, adored by every varsity male as far as the eye can see.
We have to achieve our dreams, Amy.
Otherwise, we wither and die.
Look, I'm sorry about If your supreme klutziness out there today takes me out of the running, you're gonna be so very beyond sorry.
Have a nice day.
- I told Buffy about Amber.
- Cool.
Was she wearing it?
The bracelet.
She was wearing it, right?
Pretty much like we're going out.
Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
So I'm just a figure of fun.
- I should ask her out, right?
- You won't know till you ask.
That's why you're so cool.
You're like a guy - my guy friend that knows about girls' stuff.
Oh, great!
I'm a guy!
Oh, hey, they're posting the list!
I can't take this.
Yes!
Cover me, I'm going in.
- You're lucky.
- I made it?
- Ooh!
- I made it.
One of those girls hit me really hard.
We should test for steroids.
Not only did you make the team, Buffy is the first alternate.
Amy's third.
What better way to celebrate than a romantic drive through Alternates are those who didn't make the team.
They only fill in if something happens to the ones who did.
Excuse me.
For I am Xander, King of Cretins.
May all lesser cretins bow before me.
At least it's over.
You know what I think we should do about it?
Brownie pig-out.
My house.
After school.
Just how many more hours a day can I practise?
You know, how much more can I do?
This would never have happened to my mother.
Never.
Give me the power.
Give me the dark.
I call on you, the Laughing Gods.
Let your blackness crawl beneath my skin.
Accept this sacrifice.
Cordelia.
Feed on her.
Look what I've found.
It's my yearbook from junior year.
Oh, look!
There I am.
Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex.
I am not ready to know that you had Farrah hair.
This is Gidget hair.
Don't they teach you anything in history?
- Well, it's really cool, but I gotta go.
- Well, I was thinking.
I know the cheerleading thing didn't work out.
Maybe you should think aboutjoining the yearbook staff.
I did.
It was a lot of fun.
Not really my tip, Mom.
I was, uh, photo editor.
I got to be on every page.
Made me look more popular than I was.
Have you seen the kids that do yearbook?
Nerds pick on them.
Some of the best times I had in school were working on the yearbook.
Oh, this just in.
I'm not you.
I'm into my own thing.
"Your own thing" got you kicked out of school ..
and we had to move here to find a decent school that would take you.
Honey?
Oh!
Great parenting form!
A little shaky on the dismount.
Cordelia!
You haven't been mean to me all day.
Is it something I've done?
See how she has no clue that I'm a man, much less a human being?
- I see that.
- The Invisible Man Syndrome.
A blessing in Cordelia's case.
A curse in Buffy's.
- You're not invisible to Buffy.
- It's worse.
I'm part of the scenery.
Like an old shoe.
Or a rug you walk on every day, but don't really see.
Like a pen that's chewed up - you know you should throw it away, but you don't.
Not cos you like it, more cos you're used to That is the point.
You don't have to drive it through my head like a railroad spike.
I've gotta take your advice and not beat around the bush.
Or, I could be wrong.
Maybe you should beat around the bush more.
Nah, I've gotta be a man and ask her out.
I've gotta stop giving her ID bracelets, subtle innuendoes, taking Polaroids outside her window late at night.
That last part is ajoke to relieve tension.
Here she comes.
Into battle I go.
Would you ask her out for me?
No.
Man.
Me battle.
Buffy?
- Would you like to - Is that Cordelia's locker?
Huh?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is, accompany me Friday ni Xander, I have to, um We can make this up later.
You don't mind, do you?
Nice of you to join us.
We didn't keep you waiting, did we?
Your turn to drive.
OK, people, let's buckle up.
I don't wanna drive today, Mr Pole.
You've flunked driver's ed twice.
Show me some moves, or you'll be taking the bus.
OK, check the brake.
Check the mirror.
Start the engine.
Hello?
Put the car in drive.
Let's move forward through the cones with a gentle, even turn to the Slow down!
Slow slow Turn right!
- Turn right!
- Aargh!
Brakes!
Brakes!
Brakes!
Brakes!
Brakes!
Everybody out!
- Oh, my God!
I can't see anything!
- It's OK.
Oh, God!
What's happening?
I can't see anything!
Witchcraft.
Blinding your enemy to disorient and disable them - it's a classic.
First vampires, now witches.
No wonder you can still afford a house in Sunnydale.
- Why should someone harm Cordelia?
- Maybe because they met her?
Did I say that?
And setting Amber ablaze?
- Yeah, they don't hang.
- They're both cheerleaders.
- Someone doesn't like cheerleading?
- Or likes it too much.
Amy!
- Amy.
- You're leaning towards Amy?
She's desperate.
I think she'd do anything to make her mom's dream come true.
Let me make sure I have this right.
This witch is casting horrible and disfiguring spells so that she can become a cheerleader?
You're underestimating the pressure a parent can lay on you.
If you're not a perfect carbon copy, they tend to wig.
Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
We still have to stop Amy - grab her We should be sure she's the witch before we arouse her suspicions.
- She's capable of some unpleasant things.
- OK.
So you're in high school.
You are desperate to make the team and please your mom.
So you turn to witchcraft.
What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Check out the books on witchcraft.
No!
It's the last thing you'd do.
You don't wanna leave a paper trail.
- Forget that.
- It'll just take a minute.
We don't have a minute!
Cheerleaders are in danger!
Buffy's in danger!
You were the first alternate.
You are on the team now.
You could be next.
- We gotta get you to a safe house.
- Xander?
Yeah?
"Witches: Historic Roots To Modern Practice.
Checked out by Alexander Harris".
- "The Pagan Rites.
Checked out by" - All right, it's not what you think.
You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
Oh, well, I guess it is what you think.
Have you all quite finished?
We have to find a conclusive test.
There may be something in here.
Yes, this should do it.
You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and some aqua fortis.
That's just mercury and nitric acid.
Go to the science lab.
"Heat ingredients and apply to witch".
"If the spell has been cast in the previous Oh, and you'll need some eye of newt.
Those of you in track one may begin your dissections now.
Those of you in track two, take your hydrochloric acid and your ammonium hydroxide and carefully pour them into your beakers.
- Now, slow.
Slow.
- I can't.
- capping one, and being safe.
And you get - Eye of newt.
that.
How's Buffy doing with the hair?
- Isn't this exciting?
!
- Oh, yeah!
Amy, help me.
Which is the hydrochloric acid and which is the ammonium hydroxide?
The bottle that says hydrochloric acid is usually the hydrochloric acid.
Read the bottles!
Concept!
Wave hi to the nice little witch.
All set.
- Do you have a plan?
- Spill it on her, try and make it look natural.
We're right behind you, only further back.
Lishanne, can you tell me why these chemicals have this reaction?
Lishanne?
Are you?
Oh, my God!
Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
- It's not her.
- The test was positive.
She's our Sabrina.
- She just doesn't realise what she's doing.
- Shall we talk to her?
We should talk to her mother.
Maybe she knows what she's created.
Where are you?
Another productive day in front of the TV?
I got a history report due tomorrow.
Write it.
I should be on that team by now.
But instead, Miss Buffy and friends are sneaking around stealing bits of my hair.
I'll be upstairs.
Ooh, hey, juice!
Mmm!
Quality juice.
Not from concentrate.
- You're in a good mood.
- I am!
I'm on the squad!
I feel like cheering and leading others to cheer.
- Ooh, hey, juice!
- Honey, about yesterday?
I really That is totally yester.
Besides, it's not like you were wrong, you know?
I did get kicked outta school.
I'm just wacky that way!
I just want you to know that despite the problems you've had Mom, you just don't get it.
And believe me, you don't want it.
There are some things about being a vampire slayer that - Being a what?
- It's a long story.
- Are you feeling well?
- What?
Oh, I'm fine.
What?
I can't be in a good mood?
A new house rule?
Fine, you know, that's just fine, fine, fine.
Cos Turn up the music!
Get it together, Buffy!
We have a game in less than four hours!
Willow!
Xander!
My buds are here!
I love my buds!
Hi!
Hi!
Oh!
Is it me, or is she a bit looped?
We'd better get her out of there.
Yeah, before she hurts someone.
Did I do that?
You are so outta here.
- She's on medication.
- What?
Obviously, not enough.
Who's our next alternate?
Oh.
Amy, you just made cheerleader.
No, no, no!
You don't want her, she's a w A wise choice indeed.
- She's a witchy!
- Buffy.
- I got kicked off the team, didn't I?
- I don't think it was your fault.
I know you don't.
Cos you're my friend.
You're my Xander-shaped friend!
- Do you know why I love you so, Xander?
- We've got to get her to a - Let her speak.
- I'll tell you.
- You're not like other boys at all.
- Well You are totally and completely one of the girls!
I'm that comfy with him.
That's great!
Any other guy who'd give me a bracelet, they'd wanna date me.
It'd be like a - I don't feel so good.
- Buffy?
We've gotta get her to a hospital.
May God help her.
This is a bloodstone vengeance spell.
Hits the body hard like a quart of alcohol and it eradicates the immune system.
- Vengeance spell?
She's getting even?
- She knows I know she's a witch.
The others, she just wanted out of the running.
You, she intends to, erm - Kill.
- How much time do we have?
- Ooh, er, I'm sure, er - Truth.
Please?
- A couple of hours.
Three at most.
- How do we reverse the spell?
Well, I've been researching that, and we can reverse all the spells if, we can just lay our hands on Amy's spell book.
- And if we can't get a hold of it?
- The other way is to cut the witch's head off.
Show of hands.
It's not Amy's fault.
She only became a witch to survive her mother.
I don't care why.
I care that you go on breathing.
- Giles, where would she cast these spells?
- She needs a a sacred space.
- A pentagram.
A large pot.
- Her home.
OK, help me up.
We'll just go to her house, and we'll get her book.
- OK, we'll go with you.
- No.
You guys stay here and keep an eye on Amy.
And keep her away from the science lab.
We'll need it to cast our counterspells.
Who are you?
Is there something wrong?
We need to talk to you about your daughter.
I'm not allow You'll have to come back later.
- Excuse me.
- What?
Are you all right?
Erm in here.
Your daughter is meddling with something very dangerous.
- What are you talking about?
- You know only too well.
You've got to go.
She'll be home soon, and you This girl is very sick.
You will shut up and listen to me.
Your daughter has access to powerful magics, and your cheerleading obsession I don't care about cheerleading!
It's not my fault she's doing stuff.
As her mother, you should assume some responsibility for her actions.
Yeah, well, you know these kids today.
I She's out of her mind.
Ever since Dad her dad left, I can't control her.
- You're afraid of her.
- Amy?
- Are you Amy?
- I don't understand.
She switched.
She switched your bodies, didn't she?
- Good Lord!
- She wanted to relive her glory days.
She said I was wasting my youth.
So she took it.
I didn't know anything about her powers.
I mean, when Dad was here, they would fight and yell, he would call her a witch, and I just thought he meant Oh, God, when he left, I wanted to go with him.
But she wouldn't even let me call.
She went crazy.
She'd lock herself upstairs for days, and she was always coming down on me, saying I didn't deserve to have it so easy and that I didn't know how hard it was to be her and I guess she showed me, huh?
Amy, it's gonna be OK.
A few months ago, I woke up in her bed.
I didn't know where I was.
- Then I looked in the mirror.
- She locked herself upstairs?
- Yes.
- Where?
No.
If she finds out I've been here, she'll kill me!
My God!
I believe we can reverse your mother's spell.
- Well all of them, in fact.
- You could?
- Really, you could?
- We need to find her books.
There'd be specific volumes she'd need for this kind of casting.
Collect those dolls and any other personal Nice kitty.
Let's see what you were guarding.
Ah, yes.
This is it.
- Did we find?
- We found.
Come on.
- But where are you going?
- We're going to school.
And you're coming with us.
I'm gonna stop this.
I promise.
You just hang on.
How is she?
We only have a few minutes left.
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go!

- Go!
- Six, seven, eight!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go, Sunnydale, go!
Go!
Right, here we go.
The centre is dark.
Centrum est obscurus.
The darkness breathes.
Tenebrae respiratis.
The listener hears.
Hear me!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Oh, it's working!
Unlock the gate.
Let the darkness shine.
Cover us with holy fear.
Show me Amy, what's your problem?
She's coming!
- Amy?
- Get out of my way.
Wait.
I need to talk to you.
I can help you.
Help me?
With what?
Well, you know, all your witchcraft.
I know this really good cauldron.
Do you actually ride a broom?
Xander!
Corsheth and Gilail, the gate is closed.
Receive the dark.
Release the unworthy.
Take of mine energy and be sated.
Be sated.
Release the unworthy.
Release!
Release!
Release!
- Buffy?
- Amy?
You You You little brat.
Mom, please?
How dare you raise your hand to your mother?
I gave you birth.
I gave up my life so you could drag that worthless carcass around and call it living.
You've never been anything but trouble.
I'll put you where you can't make trouble again.
Guess what.
I feel better.
That body was mine!
- Mine!
- Oh, grow up!
I shall look upon my enemy.
I shall look upon her, and the dark place will have her soul!
Corsheth, take her!
Well, that was, erm interesting.
You guys OK?
- I'm fine.
- I assume the, er ..
all the spells are reversed?
It was my first casting, so - I may have got it wrong.
- You saved my life.
You are a god.
- I didn't think you'd pull it off.
- I got her!
Cut her head off!
- Xander, what are you doing?
- Saving you?
- Get your hands off of her.
- But she's evil.
- It wasn't exactly her.
- I was my mom.
Oh!
- Where is she?
- Hey, Willow, it's cool!
- It is?
- Yeah, I took care of it.
I don't get it.
What?
I've been doing a lot of thinking about where you're coming from, how to relate to you, and I've come to a simple conclusion.
I don't get it.
I'm inscrutable, huh?
You're 16.
I think there's a a biological imperative whereby I can't understand you because I'm not 16.
Do you ever wish you could be 16 again?
Oh, that's a frightful notion.
Go through all that again?
Not even if it'd help me understand you.
I love you, Mom.
I don't get it!
My dad is so impossible!
He doesn't ever want me going anywhere.
He wants to spend total quantity time together.
And I'm, like, "I can go out.
It's perfectly safe".
But he's got all this guilt about leaving me with my mom.
He's being a total pain.
- You're loving it.
- Every single minute.
This Saturday night, he wants to stay in and make brownies.
Well, the brownies were my idea.
Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got bumped back to alternate.
Hold it.
Wait.
No, I'm not.
Well, I know I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling out words with my arms!
Ooh!
These grapes are sour.
Oh, I'm sorry!
- I forgot you wanted to be on the squad.
- Oh, that's OK.
- Cheerleading's a little too hairy these days.
- Yeah.
That's for sure.
"Catherine the Great".
And there's been no sign of her?
That last spell?
She said I'd never make trouble again.
Wherever she is, I don't think we'll have to worry.
Twisted.
I'm just happy to have my body back.
- I'm thinking of getting fat.
- You know, I hear that look's in for spring.
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
May I cut in?
- You all right?
- Oh, thanks to you.
You hurt your hand.
Will you still be able to Do my solo and kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
You're drooling.
Xander!
You've got a little Their ancestors were here long before we were.
Their progeny will be here long after we are gone.
The simple and ubiquitous ant.
Now, if you read the homework, you should know the two ways that ants communicate.
Miss Summers?
Ways that ants communicate?
With other ants?
From the homework, ants are communicating Touch and, um BO?
Thank God someone finally mentioned that.
That would be touch and smell, Miss Summers?
Is there anything else Miss Rosenberg would like to tell you?
All right.
Chapters six through eight by tomorrow, people!
Can I see you for a moment?
I gather you had problems at your last school.
Well, what teenager doesn't?
Cut school, get in fights, burn down the gymnasium.
Principal Flutie showed me your record.
Well, that fire, there was major extenuating circumstances.
- Actually, it's kind of funny.
- I can't wait to see what you'll do here.
Destructo Girl, that's me.
- But I suspect it's gonna be great.
- You mean "great" in a bad way.
You have a first-rate mind and can think on your feet.
Imagine if you actually did the The homework thing?
The homework thing.
I understand you probably have a good excuse for not doing it.
Amazingly enough, I don't care.
I know you can excel in this class and so I expect no less.
Is that clear?
Yeah.
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Be smart.
And please don't listen to the Principal or anyone else's negative opinion about you.
Let's make him eat that record.
What do you say?
OK.
Thanks.
Chapters six through eight.
Seven, including Cheryl.
But her sister was lookin' to make it eight.
Ooh!
Cheryl's sister?
The one in college?
Home for the holidays and looking for love.
She's not my type.
A girl's really gotta have something to go with me.
Something like a lobotomy?
Xander, how many times have you scored?
- Well, uh - It's just a question.
Are we talking today or the whole week?
Ooh!
Duty calls.
Babes!
- What are you doing?
- Work with me.
Blayne questioned my manliness.
I'm giving him a visual.
We'll show him!
- I don't believe it.
- I know.
And after all my conquests.
- Who's that?
- That must be Angel I think.
- Who warned her about all the vampires?
- That's him, I'll bet you.
Well, he's buff.
She never said anything about him being buff.
- You think he's buff?
- He's very attractive.
That never came up!
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.
I'd say it's nice to see you, but we'd both know that's a big fib.
I won't be long.
No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about a catastrophe, then disappear.
Right?
- You're cold.
- You can take it.
I mean you look cold.
Oh, right.
Give her yourjacket.
It's a balmy night.
No one needs to trade clothing!
It's a little big on me.
- What happened?
- I didn't pay attention.
- To somebody with a big fork?
- He's coming.
- The fork guy?
- Don't let him corner you.
Don't give him a moment's mercy.
- He'll rip your throat out.
- OK.
I'll give you improved marks for that.
Ripping a throat out is a strong visual.
It's not cryptic.
I have to go.
Sweet dreams to you, too.
That's all he said?
"Fork guy"?
That's all Cryptic Guy said - "fork guy".
There are too many guys in your life!
I'll see what I can find out.
God, every day here is the same.
Bright, sunny, beautiful.
How ever can we escape this torment?
- Really!
Morning.
- Morning.
Guess what I just heard.
No Dr Gregory today.
Ergo, those of us who blew off our homework aren't so dumb.
- Is he sick?
- They didn't say sick.
Something about missing.
- He's missing?
- Well, let me think.
The cheerleaders were modelling their new skirts.
I kinda got Yeah, they said missing.
- Which is bad?
- If something's wrong, yeah.
He's one of the only teachers that doesn't think Buffy's a felon.
I'm really sorry.
I'm sure he'II Could you help me?
Uh yes.
I'm looking for Science 109.
Oh, it's um I go there every day.
Oh, God, where is it?
Hi.
Blayne Mall.
I'm goin' there right now.
It's not far from the varsity field where I took all-city.
Oh, thank you, Blayne.
Funny how the earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
What's wrong?
If Dr Gregory dropped his glasses, why wouldn't he pick them up?
My name is Natalie French.
I'll be substituting for Dr Gregory.
- Do you know when he's coming back?
- No, I don't, um Buffy.
- They just tell me where they want me.
- I'll tell you where I want you.
Excuse me, Blayne?
Uh, I was just wondering if you were gonna pick up where Dr Gregory left off.
Yes.
His notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
The praying mantis is a fascinating creature, forced to live alone.
Who can tell me why?
Buffy?
The words "bug-ugly" spring to mind.
There is nothing ugly about these unique creatures.
They live alone because they're cannibals.
Well, it's hardly their fault.
It's the way nature designed them.
Noble, solitary and prolific.
Over 1800 species worldwide.
And in nearly all of them the female is larger and more aggressive than the male.
Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
"The California mantis lays her eggs and then finds a mate to fertilise them".
Once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sac and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger.
Now, if she's done herjob correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
You know, we should make some model egg sacs for the science fair.
Who would like to help me after school?
Good.
Hot Dog Surprise.
Be still, my heart.
Call me old-fashioned.
I want no more surprises in my hot dogs.
I wonder what she sees in me.
It's probably the quiet good looks, coupled with a smoky magnetism.
Miss French.
You're too young to understand what an older woman sees in a younger man.
- Oh, I understand.
- Good.
A younger man is too dumb to wonder why she can't find a man her own age and won't notice the surgical improvements.
- What surgical improvements?
- Well, he is young.
And so terribly innocent.
Hey, those that can, do.
Those that can't, laugh at those who can do.
Gotta carb up for my one-on-one with Miss French.
When's yours?
Oh, right.
Tomorrow.
You came in second.
I came in first.
Guess that's what they call natural selection.
Guess it's what they call a rehearsal.
Rehearsal.
Excuse you!
Medically prescribed lunch.
I'll only be here as long as I can hold my breath.
His head!
His head!
Oh, my God!
Where's his head?
!
Here.
Drink this.
No, thank you.
I've never seen I mean, I've never seen anything like That was new.
Who would want to hurt Dr Gregory?
He didn't have any enemies on the staff that I'm aware of.
He was a civilised man.
I liked him.
So did I. We're gonna find out who did this.
We'll find them and stop them.
- Count on it.
- What do we know?
Not a lot.
He was killed on campus, I'm guessing the last day we saw him.
- How do you work that out?
- He didn't change his clothing.
This is a question no one particularly wants to hear.
Where did they put his head?
Good point.
I didn't want to hear that.
Angel.
He warned me that something was coming.
Yes.
Yes, he did, didn't he?
I wish I knew what he meant.
I've been trying to gather more information about the Master, our local vampire king.
There was a reference to a vampire who upset the Master and cut his hand off in penance.
- Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
- I don't know.
- So why would he come after a teacher?
- I'm not certain he did.
There was an incident two nights ago involving a homeless person in Weatherly Park.
He was practically shredded, but nothing like Dr Gregory.
- Fork Guy doesn't do heads?
- Not historically.
Dr Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
So there's something else out there besides Silverware Man?
Oh, this is fun.
We're on Monster Island.
We're on a Hellmouth.
It's a centre of mystical convergence.
Guess it's the same thing.
Unpleasant things do gravitate here.
But we don't know there's anything besides this chap.
He's our likely suspect.
- Where was that guy killed?
Weatherly Park?
- Buffy, I know you're upset, but this is no time to go hunting.
Promise me you won't do anything rash.
Cross my heart.
Shouldn't be out here at night, little lady.
It's dangerous.
Hold it!
Police!
- I heard it.
Spread out!
- Let's go over here.
This way.
- You went hunting last night?
- Yes.
- When you assured me you wouldn't?
- Yes, I lied.
I'm a bad person.
Let's move on.
- Did you see someone with a fork?
- More like ajumbo claw.
Oh.
At least you're not hurt.
I saw something else.
Something more interesting than your average killer vampire.
- Oh?
- Do you know Miss French?
- The teacher that's subbing for Dr Gregory?
- Yes.
She's lovely.
In a common, extremely well-proportioned way.
I'm chasing Claw Guy and Miss Well-Proportioned is heading home.
Claw Guy sees her and runs screaming for cover.
- He what?
Ran away?
- He was petrified.
Of Miss French?
"I'm an undead monster that can shave with my hand.
How many things am I afraid of"?
Not many, and not substitute teachers, as a rule.
- So what's her deal?
- It'd be a good idea to keep an eye on her.
Then I'd better get to class.
You were there.
You saw Dr Gregory, didn't you?
You mean yesterday when we found him Don't say "dead" or "decapitated".
Stay away from D-words altogether.
- You witnessed it, so this way.
- I'm gonna be late.
Extremely late.
You have to see a counsellor.
- Everyone who saw the body must see one.
- I really don't We all need help with our feelings or we bottle them up.
Then laxatives are involved.
I believe if we all reach out to one another, we can beat this thing.
I'm here if you need a hug.
Not a real hug, because there's no touching here.
- We're sensitive to wrong touching.
- But I No!
You have to talk to a counsellor and start the healing.
- But, Mr Flutie, I don't - Heal!
I don't know what to say.
One minute you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge?
It gets to you, a thing like that.
It was Let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday.
I think I lost seven and a half ounces.
Way swifter than that diet that quack put me on.
Oh, I'm not saying we should kill a teacher every day so I can lose weight.
But when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side.
You know?
Like how even used Mercedes still have leather seats.
Keep your eyes straight ahead on your own test.
I think you meant "pollination" for number 14.
I'll see you here after school.
Oh, great.
A pop quiz.
No, I'm not saying she craned her neck.
We are talking full-on "Exorcist" twist.
Ouch.
How come Blayne, who worked with her yesterday, isn't here today?
Inquiring minds wanna know.
Any luck?
I've not found a creature yet that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.
Look under "Things That Can Turn Their Heads All The Way Around".
- Nothing human can do that.
- No, nothing human.
But there are some insects that can.
Whatever she is, I'm gonna be ready for her.
- What are you going to do?
- My homework.
Where are the books on bugs?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
I was just grabbing a snack.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I never eat when I'm making egg sacs.
- If this were real, the bugs would be - As big as you.
Yeah.
So, where do we start?
Oh, Xander, I've done something really stupid.
- I hope you can forgive me.
- Forgiveness is my middle name.
Actually, it's LaVelle, and I'd appreciate it if you'd guard that secret with your life.
I have a teachers' conference in half an hour and I left the paint and paper-m√¢ch√© at home.
I don't suppose you'd like to come to my place tonight to work on it?
Come to, uh your place?
Seven thirty?
Here's my address.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.
Ooh, yes!
Dig this.
"The praying mantis can rotate its head 180¬∞ while waiting for its next meal to walk by".
Well, come on, guys.
Hah!
Well, Miss French is sort of big for a bug.
And she is, by and large, woman-shaped.
OK.
Factoid one: only the praying mantis can rotate its head like that.
Factoid two: a whacked-out vampire is scared to death of her.
Factoid three: her fashion sense screams predator.
- It's the shoulder pads!
- Exactly.
Then she's either a shape-shifter or a perception-distorter.
Half a mo.
I had a chum at Oxford.
Carlyle.
Advanced degrees in entomology and mythology.
- Entomo who?
- Bugs and fairy tales.
I knew that.
If I recall correctly, Carlyle, before he went mad, claimed there was a beast Buffy, 911.
Blayne's mom told the school he never came home.
- The boy who worked with Miss French?
- Yeah.
If Miss French is responsible for Xander's supposed to be helping her.
He's got a crush on a giant insect!
OK, I'll warn him.
But I need you to hack on to the Coroner's Office.
- What are we looking for?
- Autopsy on Dr Gregory.
There were these marks on his corpse.
I think they were teeth.
And these cuddlies should definitely be brushing after every meal.
What were you saying about a beast?
Oh, yeah.
I just need to make one transatlantic telephone call.
The computer invasion Willow's performing on the Coroner's Office is entirely legal?
- Of course.
- Right.
Wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you.
Good idea.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So how'd it go with Miss French?
Oh, it's demanding being her absolute favourite, but I'll muddle through.
- Xander, she's not what she seems.
- I know.
She's so much more.
OK, I have to tell you something about her and I'm gonna need you to really listen, OK?
OK.
- I don't think she's human.
- I see.
So if she's not human, she's Technically a big bug.
- This sounds weird.
I'm aware of that.
- It doesn't.
I understand.
- I've met someone and you're jealous.
- What?
There's nothing I can do.
There's a chemical thing between us.
I know.
I read about it.
It's a pheromone.
It's a chemical attractant insects give off.
She's not an insect!
She's a woman, OK?
And, hard as that may be for you to conceive, an actual woman finds me attractive.
OK, it's no mystery guy handing outjackets.
And while we're on the subject, what kind of a girly name is Angel?
- What does that have to do - Nothing!
Itjust bugs me.
Look, I really gotta Hi.
Come on in.
Should I change?
Is this too No!
No.
It's the most beautiful chest dress I've ever seen.
Thank you.
That's sweet.
Martini?
I'm sorry.
Would you like something else?
I just need to relax a little.
I'm kind of nervous around you.
You're probably cool as a cucumber.
I like cucumbers, like in that Greek salad with yoghurt.
You like Greek food?
I'm exempting schwarma, of course.
It's a big meat hive.
Hello!
Cheers.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Have you ever been with a woman before?
You mean like in, uh the same room?
You know what I mean.
Oh, that.
Well, let me think.
Yeah, there was several.
I mean, and uh, quite a few times.
And then there was, Oh, she was incredibly - No.
Uh-uh.
- I know.
- I can tell.
- You can?
Oh, I like it.
You might say I need it.
- Oh, well, needs should definitely be met -Somebody help me!
- as long as it doesn't require ointments or - I'm down here!
- Do you hear?
- No.
- It sounds like someone crying.
- I don't hear anything.
Your hands are so hot!
Oh, you hurt your hand.
Buffy.
I love Buffy.
- Wow.
So that's a martini, huh?
- Mm-hm.
Do you hear?
Would you like to touch me with those hands?
Your hands are really serrated.
Oh, wow, that martini.
I really think I have to Miss French?
Please, call me Natalie.
Madam, I don't know what time it is, nor do I care!
Unlock his cell and bring him to the phone!
This is a matter of life and death!
Got it.
Coroner's report complete with - yuck - colour pictures.
They are teeth marks, which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
OK, I don't like this.
That's how they feed.
Head first.
And how they mate.
- She bites off the male's head while they're - No, no, no!
See, Xander's I like his head.
It's where you find his eyes and his hair and his adorable smile.
Hey, hey, take it easy, Will.
Xander is not in any immediate danger.
I saw him leave school.
He's probably safe at home right now.
- Blayne!
- Oh, God.
Are you all right?
You gotta get me outta here.
She she gets you and - What?
What does she do?
- She she Oh, God.
Oh, no.
- Blayne, what does she do?
- She she She takes you out of the cage, ties you up and she starts movin' and throbbin' and these eggs come shootin' out of her.
- And then - What?
Then what?
she mates with you.
- She?
- That's not the worst part.
- That's not?
- You seen her teeth?
While she's, you know, in the middle of I saw her do it!
- I don't wanna die like that.
- Blayne.
Blayne, chill.
That's good.
It's gonna be OK.
We'll get out of this.
You got a plan?
What is it?
- Just, uh, let me perfect it.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I understand, Carlyle.
Yes, I'll take every precaution.
Absolutely.
It sounds exactly like the creature you described.
You were right all along, about everything.
No, you weren't right about your mother coming back as a Pekinese, but Try to rest, old man.
Yes.
Ta-ta.
Bye now.
Dr Ferris Carlyle spent years transcribing a lost pre-Germanic language.
What he discovered he kept to himself, until some boys were murdered in the Cotswolds.
Then he went hunting for it.
- "It" being?
- He calls her a she-mantis.
This type of creature, the kleptes-virgo or virgin-thief, appears in many cultures.
The Greek sirens, the Celtic sea maidens who tore the living flesh from Giles, while we're young.
Well, basically the she-mantis assumes the form of a beautiful woman - ..
and then lures virgins back to her nest.
- Virgins?
Well, Xander's not a - I mean, he's probably - Gonna die.
OK, OK.
So this thing is breeding and we need to find it and snuff it.
Any tips on the snuffing part?
Carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp blade.
- Slice and dice.
- It'd better be swift.
This beast is deadly.
Carlyle faced it and he's still around.
Yes, in a straitjacket, howling his innards out day and night.
- OK, Admiral, way to inspire the troops.
- Sorry.
Xander's not home.
He told his mom he was going to his teacher's house to do a project.
Try to get her address off the substitute rolls.
And you need to record bat sonar, and fast.
Bat sonar.
Right.
What?
Bats eat them.
A mantis hears sonar, its nervous system goes kaplooie.
- Where will I find - In the vid library.
There are no books, but it's dark and musty.
You'll feel right at home.
Go!
I guess I'll handle the armoury.
Don't do anything to make her mad.
Hey, all right!
Now I can get out of my cage!
- Into yours.
What'd you do that for?
- A weapon.
I think you're gonna need it.
- Getting the address.
- Great.
Giles?
Recording bat sonar is something akin to having one's teeth drilled.
Let's roll.
According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in 1907.
- She's, like, 90 years old.
- And extremely well-preserved.
Oh, God!
He broke the cage.
Take him, not me.
Take him!
What now?
We can'tjust kick the door down.
Yeah, that would be wrong!
Hello, dear.
I thought I heard Are you selling something?
Because I'd like to help you out, but, you see, I'm on a fixed income.
- I'm looking for Miss French.
- I'm Miss French.
Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher?
Goodness, that's me!
I taught for over 30 years.
I retired in 1972.
I can't believe it!
She used Miss French's records.
She could be anywhere.
No, dear.
I'm right here.
What's she doing?
I think it's eeny, meany, miney Mo?
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.
- What do we do now?
- Prayer and supplication spring to mind.
She walked past this park with grocery bags.
She lives here.
- I'm gonna bang on doors.
- Wait!
We do not have time.
- We have to do something!
- We will.
I won't be long.
Buffy?
- Oh, yeah, here it comes.
- What's happening?
Like your eggs sunny-side up?
Eggs?
She's gonna lay some "The California mantis lays her eggs and then finds a mate to fertilise them".
Come on, Buffy!
- You!
- Me.
Come on!
Come on!
Where is she?
Which house is it?
I know you're afraid of her.
I saw you!
Come on, come on.
What?
What is it?
This is her, isn't it?
This is her house.
This is it!
Better than radar!
Buffy!
Kiss me.
- Kiss me.
- Can I say one thing?
Help!
Help!
Uh, hey!
Over here!
Hello?
In the cage!
Let him go!
- Help me!
- Get them out.
Help me!
Help me!
Remember Dr Gregory?
You scarfed his head.
He taught me: you do your homework, you learn stuff.
Like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this.
"It's important to file" - Giles!
- It's the wrong side!
Bat sonar makes your whole nervous system go to hell.
You can go there with it.
- Well, I'd say it's deceased.
- And dissected.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Just for the record, you were right.
I'm an idiot, and God bless you.
- And thank you guys, too.
- Yeah, really.
- Pleasure.
- I'm really glad you're OK.
It's so unfair how she only went after virgins.
What?
I mean, here you guys are, doing the right thing, when a lot of other boys your age Flag down on that play.
I am not See, that's the she-mantis's modus operandi.
She only preys on the pure.
Isn't this a perfect ending to a wonderful day!
My dad's a lawyer.
Anybody repeats this to anybody is gonna face a lawsuit.
Blayne, shut up!
I don't think it's bad.
I think it's really sweet.
It's certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again.
I heard a rumour there was one less vampire walking round making a nuisance of himself.
There is.
I guess I should thank you for the tip.
The pleasure's mine.
Of course, it would be easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.
I'll be around.
Or who you were.
Well, anyway, you can have yourjacket back.
It looks better on you.
Oh, boy.
All midterm papers will be exactly six pages long.
No more, no less.
One third of your grade will be dependent on those papers.
No more, no less.
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Buffy, and you're history!
Poor technique.
Prioritising, sub-par.
Execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.
Giles, don't mention it.
I was glad to make the world safe again.
I'm not saying your methods have no merit.
But you expend too much time and energy.
It should simply be plunge and move on.
Hello.
Oh, that's great!
I kill 'em, you fence their stuff.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
- But it bothers you.
- Yes.
I I thought this vampire was on a random kill, but it may be something else.
- Something big?
- Yes.
I'd best consult my books.
"And there will be a time of crisis".
"Of worlds hanging in the balance".
"And in this time shall come ..
the Anointed".
"The Master's great warrior".
"And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell".
"As it is written, so shall it be".
"Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise".
"The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny".
"As it is written, so shall it be".
And one of the Brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.
Oh, wait.
That's not written anywhere.
The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer.
If you fail to bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you Here endeth the lesson.
That symbol on the ring.
I believe it's the rune for fidelity but it doesn't connect with any of the sects that I've studied.
What about this?
On the inside it's a sun and three stars.
- Haven't we seen that somewhere?
- Let me see.
No, I don't think this represents any Wait.
It's right here.
"Sun and three stars".
Ugh.
Check these guys out.
I told you it looked familiar.
"By the Order of Aurelius".
Yes, you're right.
Ooh!
Two points for the Slayer while the Watcher has yet to score.
Oh.
Owen.
Hi.
- What do you want?
- A book?
See, this is a school and students check out books and then they learn things.
I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
I lost my Emily Dickinson.
It's dumb but I like her around.
Kind of a security blanket.
I have something like that.
Well, it's an actual blanket.
And I don't really carry it around any more.
So!
Emily Dickens, huh?
She's great.
- Dickinson.
- She's good also.
Poetry.
I didn't think I'd find you here.
- Why not?
- I didn't mean I mean I think you can read.
Oh, thanks.
But you don't seem bookwormy.
The type of person to lock themselves in a dark room with a lot of musty old books.
Oh, and I've offended you.
No!
No, I'm just surprised you gave any thought to what I'm like.
You shouldn't be.
Oh, well, I love books.
I mean, I really love books.
- What's this?
- Oh Not this one.
This one she doesn't love.
Oh!
Emily Dickinson.
- We're both fans.
- Yes.
She's quite a good poet.
I mean, for a - A girl?
- For an American.
I'll see you in math if I open my eyes at some point.
Cool.
The Order of Aurelius is a very old and venerated sect.
If they're here, it's for a good reason.
- That was Owen.
- Yes, I remember.
Do you have any more copies of Emily Dickinson?
I need one.
Buffy, while the fact that you want a book would be grounds for a national holiday, I think we should focus on the problem at hand.
Right.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
Vampires.
Oh.
Does this outfit make me look fat?
Owen Thurman was talking to you?
It's all true.
Wow!
He hardly talks to anyone.
He's solitary, mysterious.
He can brood for 40 minutes straight.
I've clocked him.
He was so nice, it was eerie.
- What did you guys have to talk about?
- Emily Dickinson.
He reads Emily Dickinson?
He's sensitive, yet manly.
But wait.
You've never even read her.
You vixen!
- Any thoughts on what this green stuff is?
- I'm avoiding the subject.
I think it's kale.
Or possibly string cheese.
- So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?
- Xander!
I mean how'd the laying go?
- No, I don't mean that either.
- It went fine, thank you.
There's a new hoity-toity vampire sect in town.
- That's bad.
- They bring in much-needed tourist dollars.
Ooh.
Look at Mr Excitement.
Owen.
He's all alone.
Maybe somebody should sit with him.
Mm, just to be polite.
Good luck.
OK, whatjust happened?
Look!
An empty seat.
- Let me get that.
- Thanks.
Boy, Cordelia's hips are wider than I thought.
At least you don't have to eat your soylent green.
Owen, a bunch of us are loitering at the Bronze tonight.
You there?
- Who all is going?
- Well, I'm gonna be there.
- Who else?
- You mean besides me?
- Buffy, what about you?
- What?
No, no, no.
She, uh She doesn't like fun.
How about we meet there at eight?
Yeah.
Eight.
There.
It's not a big deal.
It's just a bunch of people getting together.
- It's a very big deal!
- It's not.
It is!
Tell her.
- I'm afraid it's very big.
- Thank you.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
- Boys.
I'm talking about trouble.
A violent prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
- The Order of Aurelius.
- You were spot-on about the connection.
I've looked at the writings of Aurelius.
He prophesied that the brethren of his order would bring the Anointed to the Master.
- Who's that?
- I don't know exactly.
A warrior.
It says "He will rise from the ashes of the five ..
on the evening of the 1,000th day after the advent of Septus".
We'll be ready, whenever it is.
- Which is tonight.
- Tonight, OK.
- Not OK!
It can't be tonight!
- My calculations are precise.
They're bad calculations!
Bad!
- Buffy has a really important date.
- Owen.
I'll justjump in my time machine, go back to the 12th century and ask the vampires to defer their prophecy while you take in dinner and a show.
OK, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.
Buffy, this is no ordinary vampire.
We have to stop him before he reaches the Master.
But cute guy!
Teenager!
Postpubescent fantasies!
Those will just have to be put on hold.
The Dark Forces are aligning against us, and we have a chance to beat them back.
Tonight we go into battle.
- Perhaps I miscalculated.
- I'm thinking yes.
Well, you know what they say: 90 percent of the vampire-slaying game is waiting.
- You couldn't have told me 90 percent ago?
- We've certainly waited here long enough.
Besides, there aren't any fresh graves.
Who's gonna rise?
Apparently no one, tonight.
Then I can bail?
I can go to the Bronze and find Owen?
Very well.
Follow your hormones if you want.
But I assume I don't have to warn you about the hazards of becoming involved with someone who's unaware of your unique condition.
- Yeah, I read the back of the box.
- If your identity as a slayer is revealed, it could put you and all those around you in grave danger.
Well, in that case, I won't wear my button that says "I'm A Slayer.
Ask Me How".
Good night.
"Five shall die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise".
I was sure it was tonight.
I went on an airplane.
A pale horse emerged with Death as its rider.
You will be judged.
You will be judged.
That day's gonna bring fire.
Fire comin' down.
Judgment.
Don't think you're ready.
Ready to look upon him.
If there's sin in there, there's sin all around.
It's a liquid.
On that day there won't be anybody tellin' us what to do or why we're doin' it.
You can't prepare.
- On that day - You gotta sit down.
OK?
Are you willing to stand with the righteous?
Is everyone OK?
Are you all right?
Can you move?
- So you just went home?
- What was I supposed to do?
Say to Owen "Sorry, I was in a cemetery with a librarian waiting for a vampire to rise so I could prevent an evil prophecy"?
Or flat tyre?
I can't take this.
I feel like everyone is staring at me.
The hideous, dateless monster.
What?
Yeah, that's right.
I have no life.
Nothing to see here, pal!
Move it along!
You're acting a little overly.
- You could have any guy in school.
- He's not "any guy".
He's more Oweny.
Sure, he's got a certain Owenosity, but that's not hard to find.
I mean, a lot of guys read.
I can read.
- Hey, Buffy.
- Owen.
Oh, look.
It's Owen.
Buffy and Owen.
And Xander.
That'd be me.
- Where were you last night?
- Oh.
Well, my watch broke and we don't have any clocks in our house so I didn't know what time or even what day it was.
I thought I was the only one that happened to.
How about we try it again for tonight?
I'll even lend you my watch.
Tonight?
You and me?
We could invite the Chess Club but they drink and start fights.
Oh, no, it's just Well, I sort of heard that you and Cordelia were somewhat all over each other a little.
I danced with her a couple of times.
She's kinda grabby.
Well, let's see.
If I rearrange that and I push that to Sure!
Tonight'll work.
- Great.
I'll pick you up at seven?
- Um - Seven.
- That's when the little hand's there.
Oh.
Between the six and the eight.
I'll see you then.
Tonight.
Isn't that so - What?
- Me and Owen.
Yeah.
"So" it is.
It sure is "so".
- Hey!
How's it goin'?
- All right.
I see we're still workin' on that Anointed One problem.
Probably take days.
- That's one obscure prophecy.
- It has many interpretations.
Tonight's lookin' pretty slow, right?
Probably best to relax and regroup.
That is so good!
I will see you tomorrow, then.
Bye!
She is the strangest girl.
You have done well.
Everything is in place.
When this night's work is done, I will have a mighty ally.
I'll be one step closer to freeing myself from this mystical prison.
I've been trapped here so long, I've nearly forgotten what it's like on the surface.
Well, there'll be time enough to remember when I rule it.
If she tries to stop you, kill her.
Give your own lives, but do not fail to bring the Anointed.
I know you won't disappoint me.
Bug.
- Pick.
- OK.
Do I want to appear shy, coy and naive or unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive?
You know, Owen is a little homespun.
He probably won't like that overly assertive look.
Oh, hey.
Here's something.
A nice, comfy overcoat and a ski cap.
The earflaps bring out your eyes.
Maybe I should mix-and-match.
OK, guy's opinion.
Which do you think Owen will like better?
The red or the peach?
Oh, you mean for kissing you and telling all his friends you're easy so everyone loses respect for you and talks behind your back.
- The red's fine.
- Thanks.
I'll go with the peach.
Here.
Put this on.
You're not botherin' me.
- So where is he taking you?
- I don't know.
Where do kids go on dates these days?
I read somewhere once that sometimes they go to movies.
Movies?
Interesting.
And I saw on TV once a bunch of people our age went to a party.
Wow!
I never knew being a teenager was so full of possibilities.
That's Owen.
- That's Giles.
- We need to talk.
- Buffy's not home.
- My calculations may not have been far off.
"Five die in van accident"?
"Out of the ashes of five shall rise the one" is the prophecy.
Five people have died!
In a car crash.
I know It doesn't quite follow, but look!
"Among the dead was Andrew Borba, whom police sought about a double murder".
He may be the Anointed One.
The bodies were taken to Sunnydale Funeral Home.
We can - Giles, why do you want to hurt me?
- I beg your pardon?
Hey.
Uh Hi.
- You have a date?
- Yes, but I'll return those books tomorrow.
- You won't get off that easily.
- You really care about your work!
Uh Owen?
Yeah, a couple of things about tonight.
- Another date?
Don't you do anything else?
- This is the first date.
This is my maiden voyage.
What, she doesn't like to dance?
It's too late to do anything about that.
You should know that Buffy doesn't like to be kissed, or even touched.
- Xander - In fact, don't even look at her.
We don't know if this is anything.
And I haven't had a day off for a while.
And a cranky slayer is a careless slayer.
Buffy, maintaining a normal social life as a slayer is problematic at best.
This is the '90s - the 1990s, in point of fact - and I can do both.
Clark Kent has ajob.
I just wanna go on a date.
Well, I suppose it was a fairly slim lead.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I won't go far.
If the apocalypse comes, beep me.
- Is everything cool?
- All set.
Yes, and you'll face a hefty fine tomorrow.
Well, bye.
Don't wait up.
Is something going on?
Probably not, no.
I suppose I'll just go to the funeral home in case.
Just see if anything comes up.
This is bad.
I wish it was just bad.
We should go along.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't trust that Owen guy.
It's the eyes.
They're crazy.
Xander, we should go with Giles.
He could get in trouble.
Oh, he's gone!
He's gonna be all right.
He's, like, Super Librarian.
You know?
Everyone forgets, Willow, that knowledge is the ultimate weapon.
The thing about Emily Dickinson I love is that she's just so incredibly morbid.
A lot of loss, a lot of death.
It gets me.
And a lot about bees, for some reason.
Did she have a tragic and romantic life with a lot of bees?
Quiet.
Kind of sequestered and uneventful.
Which I can really relate to.
I don't get out much.
- I don't get that.
- It's my fault.
I just find most girls pretty frivolous.
I mean, there's a lot more important things in life than dating.
You know?
Did I say something wrong?
No.
Come on.
It's weird.
- What is?
- You.
One minute you're right there.
I got you figured.
The next, it's like you're two people.
Really?
Which one do you like better?
I'll let you know.
Aren't there laws against this sort of thing?
Owen?
Look at you here, all alone.
Cordelia, I'm here with Buffy.
Oh.
OK.
You wanna dance?
No, I'm still here with Buffy.
You are so good to help the needy.
Owen and I would like to be alone, and for that to happen you would have to go somewhere that's away.
Well, when you're ready for the big leagues, let me know.
Damn.
Are you having fun?
Yeah.
I almost feel like a girl.
Giles, it's us!
- What are you doing here?
- We saw two guys go in after you.
- Are they?
- They are.
You should get to safety.
- Can you get out this window?
- I'm afraid not.
This looks like ajob for Buffy.
She has a beeping thing.
No phone, of course.
We'll get her.
Just hang in there.
Do hurry.
- You want something to eat?
- Sure.
Just make it something fattening.
What a disgusting display!
Is that really appropriate behaviour in a public forum?
I mean, I've never seen a girl throw herself at a guy like that.
Oooh!
Hello, salty goodness!
Pick up that phone.
Call 911.
That boy is gonna need some serious oxygen after I'm through with him.
- Buffy.
- Angel.
Why is this happening to me?
I was hoping I'd find you here.
- You were?
- There's serious stuff happening tonight.
- You need to be out there.
- No.
Not you, too?
- What do you know?
- Prophecy, Anointed One, yada-yada-yada.
So you know.
Fine.
I just thought I'd warn you.
Warn me?
See that guy over there at the bar?
He came here to be with me.
- You're here on a date?
- Yes!
Why is it such a shock to everyone?
Here you go.
Oh.
Owen, this is Angel.
Angel, this is Owen, who is my date.
Hey.
Hey.
So, where do you know Buffy from?
Work.
- You work?
- Buffy!
Look at this.
They show up everywhere.
- Interesting.
- You don't know the half of it.
- What's he doing here?
- I guess the same thing you're doing here.
Excuse me.
What are any of you doing here?
We gotta get to We thought it'd be fun to make this a double date.
I didn't know you guys were seeing each other.
Oh, yeah.
We knew it would happen eventually.
So we figured, hey, why fight it?
And you guys are thinking double?
Cos of the fun!
And you're here because of work?
- Let's all go somewhere together.
- Gee, it's so nice of you to ask but Owen and I were sort of Owen and I. You know what would be cool?
The Sunnydale Funeral Home.
I've always wanted to go there.
The funeral home?
- Sounds cool.
Could we all sneak in?
- We saw some guys in there before.
They seemed to be having fun.
Bite me.
Owen, I gotta go.
Aren't we going to the funeral home?
No, you can't.
I'll tell you what.
I'll be back in a little while.
Buffy - What's the deal?
D'you want to bail on me?
- No!
No, no.
Remember you said I was like two different people?
Well, one of them has to go.
But the other one is having a really, really good time and will come back.
I promise.
She's the strangest girl.
- Which way?
- The room's around back.
Damn it!
This is so cool!
Owen!
You can't be here.
Oh, and you guys are allowed?
- Are we gonna see a dead body?
- Possibly several.
Guys, watch him.
Is she mad?
Oh, she just wants to make sure there are no guards so we don't get in trouble.
- Good thinkin'.
- Good thinkin'.
Giles?
- Giles!
- It is you.
Oh, good.
What happened?
Two more of the Brethren came in here after me.
But I was more than a match for them.
- Meaning?
- I hid.
But this chap was good enough to bunk with me till they went away.
But were they here after you, or was it that prophecy thing?
That's what we have to find out.
I don't know what these Brethren mean to do.
Find the Anointed?
Give him something, perhaps?
It's all very vague.
- And the Anointed may be long gone.
- But he may not be.
- We must find out.
- OK.
- I'll just get Owen and the others away first.
- Owen?
You brought a date?
I didn't bring him.
He came.
You can slay vampires and have a social life, but not at the same time.
- I know.
I'll get rid of him.
- You can't send him out alone.
We don't know where the Brethren are.
- I'll just - No!
No, Giles.
If he sees you, he's gonna have more questions.
I'll take care of it.
- Is everything OK?
- It is.
- We're leaving?
- We're still lookin' around.
He's right.
So let's find a nice, safe, fun room to look around in.
We tried the office here but it's locked.
No, it's not.
I don't think we'll find much in here.
- That's the plan.
- OK.
- What?
- I have to go now.
Um, to the bathroom.
I have to go to the bathroom.
If you hear anything, like a security guard, just be really quiet.
And barricade the door.
- Eugh.
Parts.
- Keep looking.
He must be here somewhere.
What are you guys doin'?
Uh, just in case.
Oh, my.
- Nothing.
- The Anointed must be gone.
I guess.
I mean, this is where they keep all the dead bodies, right?
I read a lot about death, but I've never really seen a dead body before.
Do they usually move?
I have been judged.
What's goin' on?
Oh, no.
He is risen in me!
He fills my head with song!
Pork and beans.
- Pork and beans!
- Gimme that!
I can smell you.
You're the chaff.
I'm blest.
I'll suck the blood from your hearts.
He says I may.
- He's in there!
- Go!
Get out!
She'll be OK.
Come on.
I think he's coming this way.
Oh, God, this is too much!
- What have you got?
- What?
- Do you have a stake?
- Oh, uh - Thank you.
- What should I do?
Make sure the others are OK.
Buffy!
Somebody's gotta help Buffy.
Owen!
They told me about you while I was sleeping.
Why does he hurt me?
Buffy?
No!
Did you see that?
He tried to bite me!
What a sissy!
No!
Dead!
He was found wanting.
You killed my date!
- Buffy, Owen's - Just give her a sec.
You killed my date!
Your turn!
Does anyone have an aspirin or sixty?
Owen.
What happened to that guy?
Oh.
We scared him away.
- Oh, good.
Cos, you know, I would've - I know.
Here.
I'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind for our first date.
Yeah.
I was hoping maybe we'd finish up at Ben & Jerry's.
- We still could.
- No.
I think I'll just walk home.
Uh Which way is home?
I'll get you there.
No.
I'll go it alone.
We'll make sure he gets home safely.
- Buffy, if I might - Don't.
Did Owen say anything about me on the way home?
You mean specifically about you?
Or generally in the area in the ballpark.
- Any sort of indication?
- In that case, no.
But he was pretty incoherent so we might have missed it.
- You think?
- No.
I knew it.
I totally blew it last night.
You need a guy who already knows your darkest secrets and still says "Hey, I like that girl".
- Someone like - Owen.
Well, this is our stop.
Hi.
Hi.
This is going well.
I don't really know how to say this but - about last night - You don't even have to.
- I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
- Totally.
And I was wondering when I could see you again.
That was my hopeful ear.
Could you repeat that?
I think you're the coolest.
- Really?
- Last night was incredible.
Nearly getting killed made me feel so alive!
So that's why you want to be with me?
Absolutely.
When can we do something like that again?
Something like?
Like walk downtown at three in the morning and pick a fight in a bar.
How about tonight?
Tonight would be not a workable thing.
Did I just say that?
Tomorrow?
I'm free any night this week.
I'm not.
Please don't take this personally.
It's not you.
It's me.
Right.
It's you.
And I was kinda hoping that maybe you and I could still be I get it.
You just wanna be friends.
That'd be nice.
Friends.
Yeah.
Great.
Yeah.
Great.
I was ten years old when my father told me I was destined to be a watcher.
He was one, and his mother before him, and I was to be next.
- Were you thrilled beyond all measure?
- No, I had very definite plans for my future.
I was going to be a fighter pilot.
Or possibly a grocer.
But my father gave me a very tiresome speech about responsibility and sacrifice.
Sacrifice, huh?
He seems like a nice lad.
Yeah.
But he wants to be Danger Man.
You, Xander, Willow You guys know the score.
You're careful.
Two days in my world and Owen really would get himself killed.
Or I'd get him killed.
Or someone else.
I went to the funeral home of my own free will.
- I should have been there.
- Buffy - I blew it.
- I have volumes of lore, of prophecies, of predictions.
But I don't have an instruction manual.
We feel our way as we go along.
And, I must say, as a slayer you're doing pretty well.
Well, I did stop that prophecy from coming true.
You did, handily.
No more Anointed One.
And I would imagine the Master, wherever he is, having a fairly bad day himself.
"And in this time will come the Anointed, and the Slayer will not know him".
"She will not stop him".
"And he will lead her into Hell".
Welcome, my friend.
Urgh!
Arghh!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Oh, look!
- It's Buffy and all her friends.
- That's witty.
Ever wonder why nobody cool hangs out with you?
Just thankful.
Were you this popular at your old school before you got kicked out?
Careful.
She might beat you up.
Hey!
- Buffy!
- You missed it!
- Missed what?
- We saw the zebras mating!
Very exciting!
It was like the Heimlich with stripes!
And I missed it.
Yet somehow I'll find the courage to live on.
- Where were you?
- Looking at the fishes.
- Was it cool?
- It was fishes.
I'm feeling you're not in the field-trip spirit.
Well, it was It's nothing.
We did the same zoo trip at my old school every year.
Same old same old.
This isn'tjust about looking at some animals.
This is about not being in class.
You're right.
Suddenly the animals look shiny and new.
Gotta have perspective.
Lance!
- How's it going?
- Hey, Kyle.
So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?
- No.
- I think it's a family reunion.
It's so touching.
Doesn't anybody have a camera?
Does your mom pick out your lice, or can you do that yourself now?
Quit it.
Hey!
Guys, come on!
- It's got my notes in there!
- What's going on here?
I've had it up to here with you four.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Did I ask you to speak?
OK, I guess I did.
But I want the truth.
Lance?
They weren't doing anything.
Really.
We were just playing around.
All right.
I'll be watching you.
You came through big time.
Way to go, Lance!
He's been looking for a reason to come down on us.
- It's OK.
- Let's check out the hyena house.
- But I think it's off limits.
- And therein, my friend, lies the fun.
What are Kyle and his buds doing with Lance?
Playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse.
- What is it with them?
- They're obnoxious.
Professionally.
Every school has 'em.
You start a new school, you get your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids.
- I'd better track Lance - I'll handle it.
This job doesn't require actual slaying.
You don't think we should follow?
Kyle and those guys are jerks, but they're all talk.
- Mostly.
- Why don't we?
Yeah, why don't we.
Hold it, hold it.
Are you blind orjust illiterate?
- Hyenas are quick to prey on the weak.
- We were just You're not going in.
Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.
No.
No one's going in there.
Why is it off limits?
It's a quarantine.
These hyenas just came in from Africa, so keep out.
- Even if they call your name.
- What are you talking about?
A Masai tribesman told me that hyenas are able to understand human speech.
They follow humans around by day, learning their names.
At night, when the campfire dies, they call out to a person.
And once they separate the pack devours them.
Cool!
I don't see any hyenas.
OK.
Now we've seen it.
- It looks cute.
- I think it looks hungry.
- Come on, Spot!
Suppertime!
- Stop Guys Stop!
It's not funny!
Stop it!
It's not funny!
- Pick on someone your own species.
- Are you gonna get in my face?
I thought Xander would be here by now.
That'd make him on time.
We couldn't have that.
Did he seem upset at all on the bus back from the zoo?
About what?
I don't know.
He was quiet.
I didn't notice anything.
But then again, I'm not as hyper-aware of him as, say, for example, you.
Hyper-aware?
I'm not constantly monitoring his health, his moods, his blood pressure.
You got it bad, girl.
He makes my head go tingly.
You know what I mean?
- I dimly recall.
- But it hasn't happened to you lately?
Not of late.
Not even for a dangerous and mysterious older man whose leatherjacket you're wearing?
- It goes with the shoes.
- Come on!
Angel pushes your buttons.
You know he does.
I suppose some girls might find him good-Iooking.
If they have eyes.
All right, he's a honey, but it's just he's never around, and, when he is, all he wants to do is talk about vampires and I - I can't have a relationship - There he is!
- Angel?
- Xander.
- Girls!
- Boy!
Sorry I'm late.
I just forgot that we were gonna be here.
- Hungry!
- Still want help with geometry tomorrow?
We can work after class.
Yeah.
What is this crap?
- Well, it was my buttery croissant.
- Man, I need some food.
Birds live on this.
What?
- What's up with you?
- Is something wrong?
- Did I do something?
- What could you possibly do?
That's crazy talk.
I'm just restless.
- Well, we could go to the ice-cream place.
- I like it here.
- OK, now what?
- You took a bath.
Yeah.
I often do.
I'm actually known for it.
That's OK.
And the weird-behaviour award goes to?
Oh, great!
It's the winged monkeys.
You know, I don't understand why you're sitting at our table.
Shouldn't you be hovering over the football stadium with Goodyear written on you?
The kid's fat!
Right!
That's enough training for one day.
That last round was sloppy.
Want to do it again?
No!
No, no, that's fine.
You just run along to class.
While I wait for the feeling to return to my arms.
Oh, my God!
Look out!
Stop!
Whoa!
Get it!
Get it!
Lordy, Herbert!
Gave Mr Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?
Students, I'd like you all to meet Herbert, our new mascot for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
- He's so cute!
- He's not cute!
No!
He's a fierce razorback!
- He doesn't look mean, Mr Flutie.
- He's mean.
He's ready for action, see?
Here are the tusks A scary razorback.
You're right.
He's a fine mascot and will engender school spirit.
He'd better.
Costs a fortune to feed him.
All right, let's get you back into your cage.
This way.
- I'm not getting this.
- It's simple, really.
The bisector of a vertex is the line that divides the angle at that vertex into two equal parts.
It's a big blur, these numbers and angles.
It's the same stuff from last week.
- Why do I need to learn this?
- Because otherwise you'll flunk math.
Explain why that's bad.
You fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that says: "Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend"?
We've been through this.
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
And I think I know what's causing it.
Ah!
That's better.
It goes right to the source of the pain.
- Xander - Forget it, OK?
I don't get it.
I won't ever.
I don't care!
We can finish this another time.
See, the problem is you kids today have no school spirit.
Hold on.
Let me get his outfit off.
Today it's all gangs and drugs and those movies on Showtime with the nudity.
I don't have cable.
I heard.
At your age, we cared about the school's reputation and the football team.
Of course, when I was your age, I had old guys saying how much better things were when they were my age.
Yeah.
All right it's raining.
All regular gym classes have been postponed.
So you know what that means.
Dodge ball.
For those of you that may have forgotten, the rules are as follows: You dodge.
- Here we go!
- On your guards!
God, this game is brutal.
I love it!
Xander?
What's wrong with you?
I guess you've noticed I've been different lately.
- Yes.
- I think I'm I think it's because my feelings for you have been changing.
And we've been friends for such a long time that I feel like I need to tell you something.
I've, um I've decided to drop geometry.
So I won't be needing your math help any more.
Which means I won't have to look at your pasty face again.
Are you gonna say something to me?
- Dogs.
- Where?
That's no way to play lead guitar!
That's hunt and peck.
It's not!
You heard Wretched Refuse play.
What do you think of the lead?
Hey!
- What are you?
- Shut up.
You're sharing.
Friends like to share.
- Good?
- It's too well done.
Hey!
That is not cool.
Hey!
Let's do lunch.
I've known him my whole life, Buffy.
We haven't always been close, but he's never I think something's wrong with him.
Or maybe there's something wrong with me.
What are you talking about?
Come on.
He's not picking on you.
He's just sniffing you a lot.
I don't know.
Maybe three isn't company any more.
You think this has something to do with me?
Of course.
No.
That doesn't explain why he's hanging out with the Dode Patrol.
Something's going on.
Something weird.
What are you gonna do?
Talk to the expert on weird.
Xander's teasing the less fortunate?
There's a noticeable change in clothing and demeanour?
Yes.
All his spare time is spent lounging about with imbeciles?
- It's bad, isn't it?
- It's devastating.
He's turned into a 16-year-old boy.
You'll have to kill him.
- Giles, I'm serious!
- So am I!
Except for the part about killing him.
Testosterone is a great equaliser.
Turns all men into morons.
He'll get over it.
I cannot believe that you are trying to Scully me!
There is something supernatural at work here.
Get your books!
Look stuff up!
Look under what?
I don't know.
That's your department.
The evidence you have is sketchy at best.
He scared the pig.
- Well, he did.
- Buffy, boys can be cruel.
They tease.
They prey on the weak.
It's a natural teen behaviour pattern.
What did you just say?
Um they tease.
They prey on the weak.
I've heard that somewhere before Xander has been acting totally wiggy since we went to the zoo.
Him and Kyle went into the hyena cage.
Oh, God, that laugh.
- You're saying Xander's becoming a hyena?
- I don't know.
Or been possessed by one?
Not just Xander.
All of them.
- Well, I've certainly never heard of - Herbert!
They've found him!
The pig?
Dead.
And also eaten.
- Principal Flutie's freaking out.
- Testosterone, huh?
What are you gonna do?
Get my books.
Look stuff up.
You four!
- What?
- Oh, don't think I don't know.
Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room.
You're busted.
Yeah.
You're going down.
- How is Herbert?
- Crunchy!
That's it!
My office!
Right now!
Now!
You'll have so much detention, your grandchildren will be staying after school!
Wow!
Apparently, Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark cos he thought they were an evil, impure mixture of dogs and cats.
Hyenas aren't well liked.
They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom.
Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy or some ducks?
- Assuming "possession" is the right word.
- I'll say it is.
The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken of animal possession for generations.
- I should've remembered.
- How does it work?
There's a sect of animal worshippers known as primals.
They believe that humanity consciousness the soul is a perversion, a dilution of spirit.
To them the animal state is holy.
They're able, through transpossession, to draw the spirit of certain animals into themselves.
Then they act like hyenas?
Only the most predatory of animals are of interest to primals.
So, yes, that would fit.
So, what happens to the person once the spirit's in them?
If it goes unchecked?
I gotta find Xander.
They are strong.
Xander!
This is ridiculous.
We need to talk.
I've been waiting for you to jump my bones!
I have seen some sick things in my life, believe me!
But this is beyond the pale!
What is it with you people?
Is it drugs?
How could you?
A poor, defenceless pig!
What are you doing?
- Get off of me!
- Is that what you really want?
We both know what you really want.
You want danger, don't ya?
- You like your men dangerous.
- You're in trouble.
You are infected with some hyena thing.
Dangerous and mean, right?
Like Angel, your mystery guy.
Well, guess who just got mean.
Now stop that!
You're only gonna make things worse for yourselves.
I am gonna call your parents, and they're gonna take you all home.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
That is it!
Do you know how long I've waited until you'd stop pretending that we aren't attracted Until Willow stops kidding herself that I could settle with anyone but you Xander, I don't wanna hurt you.
Now do you wanna hurt me?
Come on, Slayer.
I like it when you're scared.
The more I scare you the better you smell.
You're about this close to expulsion, people!
But I'm willing to talk to the school counsellor and we can discuss options.
Get down from there this instant!
Ow!
Are you insane?
!
Hurry up!
We've got to lock him up before he comes to.
- Oh, my God!
What happened?
- I hit him.
- With what?
- A desk.
- He tried his hand at felony sexual assault.
- Buffy, the hyena in him didn't No.
No.
But in his animal state, his idea of wooing doesn't involve a Yanni CD and a bottle of Chianti.
- There.
That oughta hold him.
Where's Giles?
- At some teachers' meeting.
What are we gonna do?
How do we get Xander back?
I'm more worried about what the rest of the pack are up to.
The rest of the pack was spotted outside Herbert the mascot's cage.
- They were sent to the principal's office.
- Good.
That'll show 'em.
Did it show 'em?
They didn't hurt him, did they?
They, uh ate him.
They ate Principal Flutie?
Ate him up?
The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs got into his office somehow.
There was no one at the scene.
But Xander didn't.
He was with you.
Oh, well, that's a small mercy.
How do we stop this?
How do you transpossess someone?
I'm afraid I don't have all the pieces.
Accounts of the primals and their methods are thin on the ground.
There is some talk of a predatory act, but the exact ritual is, um The Malleus Maleficarum deals in the particulars of demonic possession, which may apply.
Yes.
One should be able to transfer the spirits to another human.
Oh, that's great!
Any volunteers?
Oh.
Good point.
What we need to do is put the hyena back in the hyena.
- Until we know more - Bet that zookeeper could help.
Maybe he didn't quarantine them because they were sick.
- We should talk to him.
- OK.
- Oh, wait!
Somebody's gotta watch Xander.
- I will.
- Well, are you sure?
If he wakes up - I'll be all right.
Go.
Come on.
Willow.
How are you feeling?
Like somebody hit me with a desk.
- What am I doing here?
- You're resting.
You guys got me locked up now.
Cos you're sick.
Buffy said.
Oh, yeah.
Buffy and her all-purpose solution.
Punch 'em out, knock 'em down.
What would she do to somebody really sick?
That's not fair!
Buffy's saved both of our lives.
Before she came, our lives didn't need that much saving, did they?
Weren't things a lot simpler when it was just you and me?
- Maybe.
- When we were alone together.
I know there's something wrong with me.
I think it's getting worse.
But I can't stand around waiting for Buffy to decide it's time to punch me out again.
Look, I want you to help me.
I want you.
- I am helping you.
- You're doing what you're told.
Buffy's trying to help you, too.
You know that.
- Or Xander does.
- Yeah.
Buffy's so selfless.
Always thinking of us.
If I'm so dangerous, how come she left you alone with me?
- I told her to.
- Why?
Cos I know you better than she does.
And I wanted to be here to see if you were still you.
You know I am.
Look at me.
Look.
Xander Now I know.
Let me out!
Let me out!
The students have been possessed?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- We're really, really sure.
- You don't seem that surprised by this.
They were imported from Africa.
They were strange from day one.
I did some homework.
That particular breed is very rare.
Totally vicious.
Historically, they were worshipped by these guys.
- Primals.
- Yeah.
Creepy guys.
They had rituals for taking the hyena spirits, but I don't see how that happened to your kids.
We don't know how the ritual works.
Only that it involves, uh, - a predatory act and some symbol.
- Predatory act?
Of course.
That makes sense.
Where did you read that?
- Sherman Jeffries' work on cults and - Boys?
- Sorry.
- Look.
Look We may have enough information so that we could pull off a reverse transpossession.
What do we do?
Get those possessed students to the hyena cage right away.
- I'll meet you there.
We'll begin the rituals.
- We can guarantee you one, - but four more are missing.
- Don't worry about that.
After hyenas feed and rest, they will track the missing member until they find him.
They should come right to you.
Willow!
Willow!
I'm not listening.
Willow Willow Xander shut up!
Willow!
Run!
- I think they're going.
- They could be faking it.
No, they're looking for somebody weak.
I didn't know they'd come after Xander.
- We must lead them back to the zoo.
- And before their next meal.
Individually they're as strong as you.
As a group They're tough.
But they're getting stupider.
Go to the zoo and I'll bring them to you.
I didn't say she looks better than you.
I said she looks better.
I heard what I heard.
Joey, chew.
You have to chew or you'll choke.
I don't see why we have to have this conversation every time we see them.
I didn't start it.
Damn!
- Where are the keys?
- Huh?
Joey!
Joey!
Joey Get out!
What's going on?
Hey, get off!
Get off!
Joey!
Joey!
Joey!
Joey!
Didn't your mom teach you?
Don't play with your food.
Come on.
You know what you want.
The pathway to the hyena house.
- Where's the zookeeper?
- He must be inside.
I'll go in and prepare things.
You just warn us when Buffy and the others approach.
Doctor?
Uh zookeeper?
Oh, of course.
The, uh Masai ceremonial garb.
Yes.
Very good.
Are you, uh, otherwise prepared for the transpossession?
Almost.
Oh, right.
The, uh sacred circle.
Yes, you'd need that to, um But this would be here when the children first came.
Why would you?
How terribly frustrating for you, that schoolchildren could accomplish what you could not.
It bothered me.
But the power will be mine.
They're almost here!
Giles!
Giles!
Where are the hyenas for the transpossession?
Right here in the feeding area.
Stay back.
They haven't been fed.
- Where's Giles?
- He's laying in wait.
They're almost here!
Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?
When the time is right.
I'm gonna need your help.
They're right behind me!
That's Buffy.
Get ready!
- Here.
- What is this?
A predatory act, remember?
Uh, right.
You'll pretend to slash my throat and - and put the evil in the hyenas?
- Something like that.
Buffy, it's a trap!
Willow!
Uh did I miss anything?
The vice principal's taking over till they find a replacement.
Shouldn't be too hard.
Unless they ask what happened to the last one.
- I had nothing to do with that, right?
- Right.
- You only ate the pig.
- I ate a pig?
Was he cooked and called bacon, or Oh, my God!
I ate a pig?
- The whole trichinosis issue aside yuck!
- It wasn't really you.
Well, I remember the field trip and the hyena house.
And next thing, some guy's holding Willow with a knife.
- You saved my life.
- Hey, nobody messes with my Willow.
This is definitely the superior Xander.
Accept no substitutes.
I didn't do anything else, did l, around you guys?
Anything embarrassing?
Nah!
Not at all.
- We're gonna be late.
- See you at lunch.
Cool!
Oh, hey, going vegetarian, huh?
I've been reading up on animal possession.
I cannot find anything anywhere about memory loss afterwards.
- Did you tell them that?
- Your secret dies with me.
Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Who are you?
- I'm a friend.
- That must be Angel.
- Who warned her about all the vampires?
The brethren of his order would bring the Anointed to the Master.
Who's that?
The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer.
Welcome, my friend.
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.
She is the Slayer.
Zachary didn't return from the hunt last night.
The Slayer.
Zachary was strong and he was careful.
But still the Slayer takes him, as she has taken so many of my family.
It wears thin.
- Collin, what would you do about it?
- I'd annihilate her.
- Out of the mouths of babes - Let me do it, Master.
- Let me kill her for you.
- You have a personal interest in this.
- I don't get to have any fun.
- I will send the Three.
The Three?
Let's go.
Get it.
Come on, get it right there.
I got it.
Free drink, please.
The Fumigation Party.
It's an annual tradition.
The closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches.
It's a lot of fun.
What's it like where you are?
I'm sorry.
I was just thinking about things.
- So, we're talking about a guy?
- Not exactly a guy.
For us to have a conversation about a guy, there'd have to be a guy to talk about.
- Is that a sentence?
- You lack a guy.
I do.
Which is fine with me most of the time, but What about Angel?
Angel?
Could just see him in a relationship.
"Hi, honey, you're in grave danger.
I'll see ya next month".
He's not around much, it's true.
When he is around, it's like the lights dim everywhere else.
You know?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Annie!
Dino!
Just leaving.
Please get your extreme oafishness off my $200 shoes.
- I was just - Leaving, before Annie's boyfriend - squashes you like a bug?
- So you noticed.
Thanks for understanding.
I don't know what everyone's saying.
That outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker.
Boy, Cordelia's a regular breath of vile air.
What are you vixens up to?
Just sitting here watching our barren lives pass us by.
Look.
A cockroach.
Let's stop this crazy whirligig of fun.
I'm dizzy.
Now I'm infecting those nearest and dear to me.
I'm gonna call it a night.
- Don't go.
- Yeah, it's early.
We could dance.
Rain check?
Good night.
Want a free drink?
It's late, I'm tired and I don't wanna play games.
Show yourself.
OK.
Nice.
OK.
Look, I really don't wanna fight all three of you unless I have to.
Good dogs don't bite.
Look out!
Run!
Get in!
Come on!
No!
It's all right.
A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
I've never put it to the test.
I'll go get some bandages.
Take yourjacket and your shirt off.
Nice tattoo.
Lucky you came along.
How did you happen to come along?
I live nearby.
I was just out walking.
So, you weren't following me?
- I just had this feeling you were.
- Why would I do that?
You tell me.
You're the mystery guy that appears out of nowhere.
I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight, but if you are hanging around, I'd like to know why.
- Maybe I like you.
- Maybe?
- Honey, what are you doing?
- There's a lot of weird people out at night.
I just feel better with you safe and sound inside.
You must be beat.
- I am.
It's a little gallery, but you've no idea - Then go to bed.
- I can bring you some hot tea.
- That's sweet.
What'd you do?
Can't a daughterjust be concerned about her mother?
- Hi.
- Hi.
OK.
Angel, this is my mom.
Mom, this is Angel.
- We ran into each other on the way home.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do you do, Angel?
- He's a student.
First year at community college.
He's helping with my history.
- You know I've been toiling there.
- It's a little late for tutoring.
I'm gonna go to bed.
And Buffy?
I'll say good night and do the same.
It was nice to meet you.
Good night.
We'll hook up soon and do that study thing.
- I don't wanna get you in any more trouble.
- And I don't wanna get you dead.
They could still be out there.
So Two of us.
One bed.
That doesn't work.
Why don't you take the bed?
You're wounded.
- I'll take the floor.
- No - Believe me, I've had worse.
- OK.
Why don't you see if the Fang Gang is still loitering and keep your back turned while I change?
I don't see them.
You know, I'm the Chosen One.
It's my job to fight guys like that.
- What's your excuse?
- Somebody has to.
Well, what does your family think of your career choice?
They're dead.
Was it vampires?
It was.
- I'm sorry.
- It was a long while ago.
So, this is a vengeance gig for you?
You even look pretty when you go to sleep.
Well, when I wake up, it's an entirely different story.
Here.
Sleep tight.
Angel?
Do you snore?
I don't know.
It's been a long time since anybody's been in a position to let me know.
He spent the night?
In your room?
In your bed?
- Not in my bed.
By my bed.
- That is so romantic.
Did you I mean did he?
Perfect gentleman.
Wake up and smell the seduction.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
What?
Saving my life?
Getting slashed in the ribs?
Duh!
Guys'll do anything to impress a girl.
I once drank a gallon of Gatorade without taking a breath.
It was pretty impressive.
Although later there was an ick factor.
Can we steer this riveting conversation back to what happened earlier in the evening?
You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires.
- Did they look like this?
- Yeah.
What's with the uniforms?
It seems you encountered the Three.
- Warrior vampires.
Very proud and strong.
- How is it you always know this stuff?
You always know what's going on.
I never know.
- You weren't here until six researching it.
- No.
I was sleeping.
Obviously you're hurting the Master very much.
He wouldn't send the Three forjust anyone.
We must step up our training with weapons.
Stay at my house until these samurai guys are history.
What?
Don't worry about Angel.
We'll tell him to get out of town fast.
You're not in immediate jeopardy.
The Master will send someone else, but, in the meantime, the Three having failed will offer their own lives in penance.
We failed in our duty, and now our lives belong to you.
Pay attention, child.
You are the Anointed and there is much you must learn.
With power comes responsibility.
True, they did fail.
But also true, we who walk at night share a common bond.
The taking of a life - I'm not talking about humans, of course - is a serious matter.
So, you would spare them?
I am weary, and their deaths will bring me little joy.
Of course sometimes a little is enough.
Cool.
Crossbow.
Check out these babies.
Goodbye, stakes.
Hello, flying fatality.
- What can I shoot?
- Nothing.
The crossbow comes later.
You must first become proficient with the basic tools of combat.
Now, let's begin with the quarterstaff, which incidentally will require countless hours of vigorous training.
- I speak from experience.
- Giles, 20th century?
- I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck.
- You never know who you will be fighting.
These traditions have been handed down through the ages.
You show me good, steady progress with the quarterstaff and in due course we'll discuss the crossbow.
Put on your pads.
I'm not gonna need pads to fight you.
We'll see about that.
En garde!
Good.
Let's move on to the crossbow.
Angel?
I brought you some dinner.
It's a little plateless.
Sorry.
So.
What did you do all day?
I read a little.
And just thought about a lot of things.
Buffy, I My diary?
You read my diary?
That is not OK.
A diary is like a person's most private place.
You don't know what I was writing about.
Hunk can mean a lot of things.
Bad things.
And when I said your eyes are penetrating, I meant bulgy.
Buffy A doesn't stand for Angel.
It stands for Achmed, a foreign exchange student.
That fantasy part has nothing to do with you.
Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up.
I watched her.
I didn't read it.
I swear.
I did a lot of thinking today.
I really can't be around you.
- Because when I am - Hey, no big.
Water over the bridge.
..
all I can think about is how badly I wanna kiss you.
Kiss me?
I'm older than you, and this can't ever I better go.
How much older?
- I should - Go, you said What?
What's wrong?
Buffy, what happened?
Nothing.
I saw a shadow.
- Angel's a vampire?
- I can't believe this is happening.
One minute we were kissing and the next minute - Can a vampire ever be a good person?
- A vampire isn't a person at all.
It may have the movements, memories, even personality of who it took over, but it's still a demon at the core.
There is no halfway.
So that'd be a no?
Then what was he doing?
Why was he good to me?
Was it all some part of the Master's plan?
It doesn't make sense.
All right, you have a problem and it's not a small one.
Let's take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively.
Angel's a vampire.
You're a slayer.
I think it's obvious what you have to do.
- It is a slayer's duty.
- I know you have feelings for this guy.
But you're not in love with him, right?
In love with a vampire?
Are you out of your mind?
What?
Not vampire.
How could you love an umpire?
Everyone hates 'em.
Where did you get that dress?
This is a one-of-a-kind Todd Oldham.
Do you know how much this dress cost?
Is this a knockoff?
It's a cheesy knockoff.
This is what happens when you sign free trade agreements.
We think we have problems.
- Who's here?
- A friend.
Hi.
It's been a while.
- A lifetime.
- Or two, but who's counting?
What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look?
Last time I saw you, it was kimonos.
And last time I saw you, it wasn't high-school girls.
Don't you like?
Remember Budapest?
Turn of the century?
- You were a bad boy during that earthquake.
- You did some damage yourself.
Is there anything better than a natural disaster?
The panic.
The people lost in the streets.
It's like picking fruit off the vine.
Nice.
You're living above ground.
Like one of them.
You and your new friend are attacking us.
Like one of them.
But guess what, precious?
You're not one of them.
- Are you?
- No.
But I'm not exactly one of you, either.
Is that what you tell yourself these days?
You're not exactly living off quiche.
You and I both know what you hunger for, what you need.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's who we are.
It's what makes eternal life worth living.
You can only suppress your real nature for so long.
I can feel it brewing inside of you.
I hope I'm around when it explodes.
- Maybe you don't wanna be.
- I'm not afraid of you.
I bet she is, though.
Or maybe I'm underestimating her.
Talk to her.
Tell her about the curse.
Maybe she'll come around.
And if she still doesn't trust you, you know where I'll be.
Here's something at last.
- Can you please warn us before you do that?
- There's nothing about Angel, but it's been ages since I've read the diaries of any of the watchers before me.
How embarrassing when you thought he had read your diary, but he hadn't, but then he felt the same way - I'm listening.
- There's mention some 200 years ago in Ireland of Angelus, the one with the angelic face.
They got that right.
I'm not saying anything.
I have nothing to say.
Does this Angel have a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
Yeah.
It's a bird or something.
Now I'm saying something.
You saw him naked?
- Angel's been around for a while.
- Not long for a vampire.
240 years or so.
Angelus leaves Ireland, wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades and then about 80 years ago the most curious thing happens.
He comes to America, shuns other vampires and lives alone.
There's no no record of him hunting here.
So he is a good vampire.
I mean, on a scale of one to ten.
Ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night and one being someone who's not.
I say that there's no record.
But vampires hunt and kill.
It's what they do.
- Fish swim.
Birds fly.
- He could've fed on me.
He didn't.
Question: 100 years or so before he came to our shores.
What was he like then?
Like all of them.
A vicious, violent animal.
Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three.
How can my children learn if I do everything for them?
- You've gotta let me take care of the Slayer.
- You're giving me orders now.
OK.
We'll just do nothing while she takes us out one by one.
Do I sense a plan, Darla?
Share.
- Angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
- Angel.
He was the most vicious creature I ever met.
- I miss him.
- So do I. - Why would he kill her if he feels for her?
- To keep her from killing him.
You see?
How we all work together for the common good?
That's how a family is supposed to function.
OK, so let's review.
Reconstruction began when?
Buffy?
Reconstruction.
Reconstruction began after the construction, which was shoddy, so they had to reconstruct.
After the destruction of the Civil War.
Right.
Civil War.
During which Angel was already 100 and change.
Are we gonna talk about boys or are we gonna help you pass history?
Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander's gonna grab me and kiss me right on the lips.
If you want Xander, speak up, girl.
No.
No speaking up.
That way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
OK, so here's something I gotta know.
When Angel kissed you I mean, before he turned into How was it?
Unbelievable.
And it is kinda novel how he'll stay young and handsome for ever.
Although you'll still get wrinkly and die and What about the children?
- I'll be quiet now.
- No, it's OK.
I need to hear this.
I need to get over him, so I can So that you can Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer and he's a vampire.
God, I can't.
He's never done anything to hurt me.
OK, I need to stop thinking about this.
OK, give it another half an hour and maybe something will sink in.
Then I'm going home for some major moping.
OK.
The era of the Congressional Reconstruction, usually called Radical - Hello?
- Hi, I'm Darla.
- A friend of Buffy's.
- Nice to meet you.
She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a study date?
No, I thought she was studying with Willow.
She is.
Willow's the Civil War expert.
I was supposed to help her with the War of Independence.
My family kinda goes back to those days.
She'll be home soon.
Would you like to come in and wait?
It's very nice of you to invite me into your home.
You're welcome.
I've been wrestling with the IRS all night.
- Would you like something to eat?
- Yes.
I would.
Let's see what we have.
Do you feel like something little or something big?
Something big.
- Let her go.
- I just had a little.
There's plenty more.
Aren't you hungry for something warm after all this time?
Come on, Angel.
Just say yes.
Welcome home.
Hey.
I'm home.
You're not welcome here.
You come near us and I'll kill you.
Mom?
Mom, can you hear me?
Yes.
I need an ambulance.
My mother cut herself.
She lost a lot of blood.
Please, please hurry.
- Mom?
- Buffy.
- My God.
- What happened?
Angel.
- Do you remember anything, Mom?
- Just Your friend came over.
- I was gonna make a snack.
- My friend?
I guess I slipped and cut my neck on The doctor said it looked like a barbecue fork.
We don't have a barbecue fork.
Are you another doctor?
No.
Mom, this is Mr Giles.
The librarian from your school.
What's he doing here?
I just came to pay my respects.
Wish you a speedy recovery.
Boy, the teachers really do care in this town.
Get some rest now.
She's gonna be OK.
They gave her some iron.
Her blood count was a little A little low.
It presents itself like mild anaemia.
You were lucky you got to her as soon as you did.
Lucky?
Stupid.
- Buff, it's not your fault.
- No?
I invited him into my home.
Even after I knew who and what he was.
And I didn't do anything about it.
Because I had feelings for him.
Because I cared about him.
If you care about somebody, you care about them.
You can't change that by Killing them?
Maybe not.
But I think it's a start.
- We'll keep an eye on your mom.
- Buffy.
You can't stop me.
The Three found me near the Bronze.
So did he.
He lives nearby.
This is no ordinary vampire.
If there is such a thing.
Now, he knows you.
He's faced the Three.
I think this is gonna take more than a stake.
So do I. She's out hunting you right now.
She wants to kill you.
- Leave me alone.
- What did you think?
Did you think she would understand?
That she would look at your face, your true face, and give you a kiss?
For 100 years you've not had a moment's peace because you will not accept who you are.
That's all you have to do.
Accept it.
Don't let her hunt you down.
Don't whimper and mewl like a mangy human.
Kill.
Feed.
Live.
All right.
- What do you want?
- I want it finished.
That's good.
You're hurting me.
That's good, too.
She talks about you all the time.
It's important teachers make an impression.
She makes quite an impression herself.
I know she's having trouble with history.
Is it too difficult for her, or is she not applying herself?
She lives very much in the now.
History, of course, is very much about then.
But there's no reason She's studying with Willow.
She's studying with Darla.
She is trying.
Darla?
I don't believe I know Her friend who came over tonight.
Darla came tonight.
She's the friend you mentioned earlier?
I must have frightened her half to death when I fainted.
- Someone should make sure she's all right.
- Yes, someone should.
Right away.
I'll do it.
That school is amazing.
We have a problem.
I know you're there.
And I know what you are.
- Do you?
I'm just an animal, right?
- You're not an animal.
Animals I like.
Let's get it done.
Come on.
Don't go soft on me now.
- A little wide.
- Why?
Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance?
Was it ajoke?
To make me feel for you and then I've killed a lot of vampires.
I've never hated one before.
It feels good, doesn't it?
It feels simple.
I invited you into my home and you attacked my family.
Why not?
I killed mine.
I killed their friends.
And their friends' children.
For 100 years, I offered an ugly death to everyone I met.
And I did it with a song in my heart.
- What changed?
- I fed on a girl about your age.
Beautiful.
Dumb as a post, but a favourite among her clan.
- Her clan?
- The Romany.
Gypsies.
The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me.
They restored my soul.
They were out of boils and blinding torment?
When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body but not your soul.
That's gone.
No conscience, no remorse.
It's an easy way to live.
You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done, and to care.
I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
So, you started with my mom?
- I didn't bite her.
- Why didn't you say something?
But I wanted to.
I can walk like a man, but I'm not one.
I wanted to kill you tonight.
Go ahead.
Not as easy as it looks.
Sure it is.
- We're near the Bronze.
What now?
- Keep looking for her.
I have a question.
What if she's fighting Angel and his friends?
What the heck are we gonna do about it?
Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
- Bad hair on top of that outfit?
- To love someone who used to love you.
You guys were involved?
For several generations.
You've been around since Columbus.
You are bound to pile up a few ex's.
You're older than him, right?
You are looking a little worn around the eyes.
I made him.
There was a time when we shared everything.
Wasn't there, Angelus?
You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for 1,000 years.
But you threw that away because of her.
You love someone who hates us.
You're sick.
And you'll always be sick.
And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die.
- You don't think I came alone, do you?
- I know I didn't.
Scary.
Scarier.
Don't worry.
Bullets can't kill vampires.
It can hurt them like hell, but Did you just hear?
So many body parts.
So few bullets.
Let's begin with the kneecaps.
No fun dancing without them.
Close, but no heart.
We need to distract her.
Fast.
Buffy, Angel didn't attack your mom.
It was Darla.
Come on, Buffy.
Take it like a man.
Angel?
Forget her.
How dare you.
She was my favourite.
For 400 years.
She was weak.
We don't need her.
I'll bring you the Slayer.
But to lose her to Angel.
He was to have sat at my right hand come the day.
- And now - They're all against you.
But soon you shall rise, and when you do, we'll kill them all.
The Post-Fumigation Party.
How's it different to the Pre-Fumigation Party?
Much hardier cockroaches.
So, no word from Angel?
I swear, though, in his way I feel like he's still watching me.
Well, in a way he sort of is.
In the way of that he's right over there.
I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened.
I'm just gonna look this way.
I just wanted to see if you were OK and your mother.
We're both good.
You?
If I can go a while without getting shot or stabbed, I'll be all right.
- Look, this can't - Ever be anything.
I know.
For one thing, you're 224 years older than I am.
I just gotta I gotta walk away from this.
I know.
Me, too.
One of us has to go here.
I know.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Well, as long as they're not kissing.
You OK?
- It's just - Painful.
I know.
See you around?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.
She is the Slayer.
No.
Oh, great.
A book.
Oh, I haven't gone through the new arrivals.
Put it in that pile.
- Here, I'll get it.
- Oh.
Thanks, Dave.
Willow pile.
When I've examined it, you can er - ..
skim it.
- "Scan" it, Rupert.
That's "scan" it.
- Of course.
- I know our ways are strange to you.
But soon you will join the 20th century, with three years to spare!
Ms Calendar, I'm sure your computer-science classes are fascinating.
But one can survive in modern society without being a slave to the idiot box.
That's TV.
The idiot box is TV.
- This is the good box.
- I still prefer a good book.
The printed page is obsolete.
Information isn't bound up any more.
It's an entity.
The only reality is virtual.
If you're notjacked in, you're not alive.
Thank you, Fritz, for making us all sound like crazy people.
Fritz comes on a little strong, but he does have a point.
For the last two years more e-mail was sent than regular mail.
More digitised data crossed phone lines than conversations.
That is a fact that I regard with genuine horror.
I'll bet it is.
- Let's wrap it up for today.
- I've just got a few more.
I'll hang for a bit.
Cool.
Thanks.
- Xander, wanna stay and help?
- Are you kidding?
Yes.
It was ajoke I made up.
- Willow, I love you but bye!
- See you tomorrow.
- Buffy, wait up.
- I'm going to stay and clean up a little.
- I'll be back in the Middle Ages.
- Did you ever leave?
Willow!
Willow, hey, wait up!
Oh, Buffy.
I didn't even see you.
Or hear me!
What was up last night?
I tried your line a million times.
- Oh, I was I was talking.
- Talking to?
- You have a secret and that's not allowed.
- Why not?
Cos there's a rule.
Well I sort of met someone.
I knew it!
When did you meet?
Last week, after we did the scanning project in the library.
Is he here?
What's his name?
Did you kiss?
What's he like?
No.
Malcolm.
No.
And very nice.
You are evil for not telling me this right away.
I wasn't sure there was anything to tell.
But last night we talked all night.
It was amazing.
He's so smart, Buffy, and he's romantic, and we agree about everything.
- What's he look like?
- I don't know.
Yes, I will.
I promise.
So you've been seeing a guy and you don't know what he looks like.
OK, this is a puzzle.
I'm good at these.
Does it involve a midget and a block of ice?
I met him on line.
On line for what?
- Oh!
- Good morning, kids.
- Buffy, are you supposed to be somewhere?
- No, I have a free.
Cool.
But this is lab time, so make it a short visit, OK?
- Sure.
- You have mail.
It's him.
- He's so sweet!
- He's a sweetie.
What should I write back?
Willow, I think it's really great that you have this cool pen pal, but ..
don't you think you're kind of rushing all into this?
"I'm thinking of you, too".
No.
That's incredibly stupid.
Down, girl.
Let's focus here, OK?
What do you actually know about this guy?
Oh, I knew you'd react like this.
Like what?
I just wanna make sure you're careful, that's all.
Buffy He could be different than you think.
His name is Malcolm Black.
He's 18.
He lives is Elmwood, about 80 miles from here, and he likes me.
Short?
Tall?
Skinny?
Fat?
Why does everything have to be about looks?
Not everything, but some stuff is.
What if you guys get really intense, and then you find out that he has a hairy back?
Well No.
He doesn't talk like somebody who would have a hairy back.
And anyways, that stuff doesn't matter when you really care about each other.
Maybe I'm not his ideal either.
Hey, I just hope he's good enough for you.
I think it's great that you met someone.
Hey, Fritz.
I'm looking at the logs.
You and Dave are clockin' a scary amount of computer time.
- New project.
- Ooh!
Will I be excited?
You'll die.
This isn't my report.
"Nazi Germany was a model of a well-ordered society"?
!
I didn't write that!
Who's been in my files?
- Guess who.
- Uh Xander?
Yeah, but keep guessing anyway.
- Xander.
- Aw, I can't fool you.
You see right through my petty charade.
- Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
- Not me.
I think I'll call it an early night.
Oh.
Malcolm, right?
Yeah, I heard.
But you'll miss out.
I'm planning to make fun of everyone who won't talk to me.
That's nice.
Have a good time.
She certainly looks perky.
Yeah.
Colour in the cheeks, bounce in the step.
I don't like it.
It's not healthy.
So, are you going to the Bronze tonight?
Oh, you probably have some vampire slaying or some lame endeavour like that, don't you?
Everyone deserts me.
- Check out the jealous man!
- What are you talking about?
- You're jealous.
- Of what?
- Willow has a thang and you're left hanging.
- That's meaningless drivel.
- I'm not interested in Willow like that.
- You liked being the belle of the ball.
It's just this Malcolm guy.
What's his deal?
Tell me you're not slightly wigged.
OK, slightly.
Just not knowing what he's really like.
Or who he really is.
I mean, he says he's a student, but I can say I'm a student.
- You are.
- But I can also say I'm an old Dutch woman.
And why not, if I'm in the old Dutch chat room?
I get your point.
I get your point.
This guy could be anybody.
He could be weird or crazy or old or - He could be a circus freak.
He probably is!
- We read about it all the time.
People meet on the Net, they talk, meet up, have dinner, a show - horrible axe murder.
Willow, axe-murdered by a circus freak?
OK, what do we do?
What are we doing?
Xander!
You get me started!
We are totally overreacting.
But it's fun, isn't it?
I'm jacked in.
I'm jacked in.
I'm jacked in.
I'm jacked in.
Whoa.
You're a little late, girl.
- I overslept.
- Till fifth period?
- Talkin' to Malcolm last night?
- Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
You're having an expression.
I'm not.
But if I was, it'd be saying: this just isn't like you.
Not like me to have a boyfriend?
He's boyfriendly?
I don't understand why you don't want me to have this.
I mean, boys don't chase me around all the time.
- I thought you'd be happy for me.
- I just want you to be sure.
To meet him face to face.
In daylight, in a crowded place, with some friends.
You know, before you become all obsessive.
Malcolm and I really care about each other.
Big deal if I blow off a couple of classes.
I thought you said you overslept.
Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.
Malcolm was right.
Dave?
Hey there, Dave.
Anybody home?
- What do you want?
- To ask you something, if you have a minute.
- What is it?
- Well, you're a computer geek genius, ..
and I sort of have a technical problem.
If I wanted to find out about someone who e-mailed me, could I trace the letter?
Well, you could pull out somebody's profile based on their user name.
But they write the profile themselves, right?
So they can say what they want.
- True.
- Wow.
I had knowledge.
Is there a way to find out exactly where an e-letter came from?
The actual location of the computer?
That's a challenge.
- Cos Willow's got this boyfriend Malcolm - Leave Willow alone.
- What do you mean?
- That's none of your business.
- Dave, are you Malcolm?
- Of course not.
- Dave, what's going on?
- Look.
I'll talk to you later, OK?
I've got work to do.
So do I. I'm telling you, something is going on.
It's notjust Willow.
- Dave, Fritz they're all wicked jumpy.
- They aren't sparklingly normal as it is.
- Giles, trust me.
- I do.
I really don't know how to advise you.
Things involving the computer fill me with a childlike terror.
If it were a nice ogre or some such, I'd be more in my element.
I suppose you could tail Dave.
See if he's up to something.
Follow Dave?
What, in dark glasses and a trench coat?
Please.
I can work this out myself.
She's too close.
What do I do?
Party.
Whatever Dave is into, it's large.
- What was the name of this place?
- It said CRD.
But I wasn't close enough to see what it was.
A computer research lab.
Sunnydale's third largest employer till it closed down last year.
- What, I can't have information sometimes?
- It's just somewhat unprecedented.
Well, my uncle used to work there in a floor-sweeping capacity.
- But it closed?
- Uh-huh.
Looked functional to me.
I don't have a clue what they were doing.
- And what do they need Dave for?
- Something about computers, right?
I mean, he is off-the-chart smart.
We still don't know an enormous amount.
Whatever is going on there may be on the up and up.
- If CRD opened, it woulda been on the news.
- I can tell something's wrong.
- My spider sense is tingling.
- Your spider sense?
- Pop-culture reference.
Sorry.
- I think we're still at a standstill.
- Short of breaking in - Breaking in.
This is the plan.
- I'm free tonight.
- Tonight it is.
A moment, please, of quiet reflection.
I did not suggest that you illegally enter ..
data into the file so the book will be listed by title as well as author.
I came to check your database, make sure your cross-reference table isn't glitching.
- Cos I bet you haven't gone near it.
- I'm still sorting through the chaos you left.
Hmm.
You here again?
You kids really dig the library, don't you?
- We're literary.
- To read makes our speaking English good.
- We'll be going now.
- We'll continue this conversation later.
We're done.
- "Makes our speaking English good"?
- I panicked.
I've never felt this way about anyone before, Willow.
I know what you mean.
I feel like you know me better than anyone.
- I do.
- Do you think we should meet?
I think we should, soon.
I'm nervous.
I'm not.
Isn't that strange?
That's what Buffy doesn't understand.
How comfortable you can make me feel.
Buffy just makes trouble.
That's why she got kicked out of her old school.
How did you know that?
It's on her permanent record.
You must have mentioned it.
I guess.
Let's not worry about her any more.
I have to sign off.
I'll talk to you later.
Don't.
- You're a snob.
- I am no such thing.
Oh, you are a big snob.
You think knowledge should be kept in guarded repositories ..
where only a few white guys can get at it.
Nonsense!
I simply don't adhere to a knee-jerk assumption ..
that because something is new, it's better.
This isn't a fad, Rupert.
We are creating a new society here.
A society in which human interaction is all but obsolete?
In which people are completely manipulated by technology?
Thank you, I'll pass.
Well, I think you'll be very happy here with your musty old books.
These musty old books have much more to say than in any of your fabulous Web pages.
This one doesn't have a whole lot more to say.
What is it?
Like a diary?
How odd.
I haven't looked through all the volumes yet and I didn't What is it?
Er, nothing.
A diary, yes.
I imagine that's what it is.
Well, it's been so nice talking to you.
- We were fighting.
- Must do it again sometime.
Bye now.
I checked the computer.
His file says nothing about being allergic to penicillin.
- Buffy.
- Dave.
- How are you doin'?
- OK.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
- I haven't slept much lately.
- Don't sweat it.
- Willow was looking for you.
- Good.
I need to talk to her.
Do you know where she is?
- She said she'd be in the girls' locker room.
- Great.
Thanks.
Will?
Willow?
Will?
Are you taking a shower?
I guess not.
This is how droughts start.
Buffy!
Get out!
I can't do it!
I'm not gonna do it.
But you promised.
Buffy isn't a threat to you!
It's not worth it.
The project is almost complete.
You won't have to do it again.
I can't.
I've shown you a new world, Dave.
Knowledge, power I can give you everything.
All I want is your love.
No.
This isn't right.
None of it is.
I'm sorry.
I've been a terrible person.
I'm a coward and I can't go on living like this.
Forgive me, Mom and Dad.
At least now I'll have some peace.
Remember me.
Love, Dave.
- I'm gonna kill Dave!
- He tried to warn me.
Warn you that he set you up?
- Is she gonna be OK?
- She was only grounded for a moment.
Still If you'd been anyone but the Slayer Tell me the truth.
How's my hair?
It's great.
It's your best hair ever.
Oh.
Yes.
I just don't understand what would make Dave do a thing like that.
I think perhaps I do.
- Does this look familiar to either of you?
- Yeah, sure.
- It looks like a book.
- I knew that one.
In the Dark Ages, the souls of demons were sometimes trapped in certain volumes.
They remained locked within the book, harmless, unless the pages were read aloud.
Unless I'm mistaken, this is Moloch, the Corrupter.
A very deadly and seductive demon.
He draws people to him with promises of love, power, knowledge.
- He preys on impressionable minds.
- Like Dave's.
Dave and who knows how many others.
- And Moloch is inside that book?
- Not any more.
- You released Moloch?
- Way to go!
I didn't read it!
That dreadful Calendar woman found it and it was already blank.
So a powerful demon with horns is walking around Sunnydale and nobody's noticed?
If he's so big and strong, why use Dave?
- Why didn't he attack Buffy himself?
- I don't know.
And who read that book?
It wasn't even in English.
- Where was it?
- In a pile with others that were scanned.
That released the demon?
No, he's not out here.
He's in there.
The scanner read the book.
It brought Moloch out as information to be absorbed.
He's gone binary on us.
OK, for those of us in our studio audience who are me, you guys are saying Moloch is in this computer?
And in every computer connected to it by a modem.
- He's everywhere.
- What are we gonna do?
Willow scanned him into her file.
It may be a futile gesture, but I suggest we delete it.
Solid.
- Don't get too close.
- OK.
OK.
So which file do you think it is?
Willow?
That's probably it, right?
I'll just delete the whole thing.
Stay away from Willow!
It is none of your business!
So that's what Malcolm looks like.
- So much for "Delete file".
- This is very bad.
Are we overreacting?
He's in a computer.
What can he do?
Besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me?
I don't know.
- Mess up medical equipment everywhere.
- Randomise traffic signals.
- Access launch codes for nuclear missiles.
- Destroy the world's economy.
- I think that nuclear missile thing capped it.
- Right.
Yours was best.
OK, he's a threat.
I'm on board with that now.
But what can we do about it?
First, we find Willow.
She's probably talking to him right now.
God, that creeps me out!
- What does he want with Willow?
- Let's never find out.
OK.
I'm gonna check the computer lab ..
and you guys call her home.
Willow?
- No answer.
- Damn it.
It wasn't busy either, so she's not on line.
- She's not home.
- What did you find?
- Willow isn't?
- Dave.
- He's dead.
- How?
Well, it looks like suicide.
With a little help from my friends?
I'd guess Fritz.
Or one of their zomboids from CRD.
OK.
You and I are going to Willow's house.
Giles, you find a way to get Moloch out of the Net.
I have records of the ceremonies, but that's for a creature of the flesh.
This could be something completely different.
Then get Ms Calendar.
Maybe she can help you.
Even if she could, how do I convince her there's a demon on the Internet?
Fine.
Then come up with a better plan.
Come on.
Mom?
Dad?
You have mail.
You have mail.
Dad, did you forget your keys again?
No more waiting.
A spokesman blamed computer error for the financial discrepancy.
"Binding ritual" All FBI serial-killer profiles have been mysteriously downloaded from - I got your message.
What's so urgent?
- Thank you for coming.
Er I need your help.
But before that, I need you to believe something that you may not want to.
Er, there's Something's got into the inside, erm There's a demon in the Internet.
I know.
Willow?
This isn't good.
Willow?
Willow?
OK, any thoughts?
"No more waiting.
I need you to see me"?
See him how?
Where?
- What about CRD?
- The research place?
- I'm guessing that's Moloch Central.
- That's our best lead.
Let's just hope Giles can back us up.
You already know?
How exactly is that?
Come on.
There have been portents for days.
Power surges, on-line shutdowns You should see the bones I've been casting.
I knew this would happen sooner or later.
It's probably a mischief demon, like Kelkor or It's Moloch.
The Corrupter?
Oh, boy.
- I should have remembered.
- You don't seem exactly surprised.
- Who are you?
- I teach computer science at high school.
That hardly involves the casting of bones.
Wrong, snobby.
You think the mystical is limited to ancient texts and relics?
That bad old science made the magic go away?
The divine exists in cyberspace, same as out here.
Are you a witch?
I don't have that kind of power.
"Techno pagan" is the term.
There are more of us than you think.
Well, er you can definitely help me.
What's in cyberspace at the moment is less than divine.
I have the binding rituals, but I'm completely out of my idiom.
Well, I can help - I think.
I hope.
I mean, this is my first real Do you know how he got in?
- He was "scanned" is the term, I believe.
- And you want him back in the book.
- Buffy?
- Yeah.
- Willow?
- Not at home.
Looks like she was taken away.
- Where are you?
- CRD.
Whatever Moloch wants Willow for is probably in there.
Ms Calendar and I hope to get Moloch off line.
Here's a tip: hurry.
Welcome, my love.
I can't tell you how good it is to see you with my own two eyes.
- Willow.
- Malcolm.
This world is so new, so exciting.
I can see all of it.
Everything flows through me.
I know the secrets of your kings, but nothing compares to having form again.
To be able to walk.
To touch.
To kill.
- Back way?
- Back way.
Here they come.
The first thing we have to do is form the Circle of Kayless.
Right?
Form a circle?
But there's only two of us.
It's really more of a line.
We have to form the circle inside.
I'll put out a flash.
I hope enough of my group responds.
Won't Moloch just shut you down?
I'm betting he won't figure it out till it's too late.
- Hoping and betting, that's what we've got.
- Wanna throw in praying?
Be my guest.
I don't understand.
What do you want from me?
I want to give you the world.
- Why?
- You created me.
I brought these humans together to build me a body.
But you gave me life.
Took me out of the book that held me.
- I want to repay you.
- By lying to me?
By pretending to be a person?
Pretending you loved me?
I do.
Buffy!
- It's her.
- Yeah.
Who's the other guy?
Don't you see?
I can give you everything.
I can control the world.
Right now a man in Beijing is transferring money to a Swiss bank account for a contract on his mother's life.
Good for him.
- I can't bust it.
It's heavy steel.
- Then let's find another way in.
What's goin' on?
The building security system is computerised.
Whoops.
Almost there.
Couldn't you just stop Moloch by entering some computer virus?
You've seen way too many movies.
OK, we're up.
- You read, I type.
Ready?
- I am.
"By the power of the divine, by the essence of the word, I command you".
- Let me leave.
- But I love you.
Don't say that.
That's ajoke.
You don't love anything.
You are mine.
I'm not yours.
I'm never gonna be yours.
Never.
Pity.
"By the power of the Circle of Kayless, I command you".
Kayless with a K. I'll miss you.
Demon, come!
I command you!
Ow!
The guy's made of metal.
No!
I won't go back!
Demon, come!
Whoa!
Hey!
I got to hit someone!
He's out of the Net.
He's bound.
He's not in the book.
He's not in the book.
Where is he?
- Let's go this way.
- Wait!
I was omnipotent.
I was everything!
Now I'm trapped in this shell.
Malcolm!
Remember me - your girlfriend?
I think it's time we break up!
But maybe we can still be friends!
This body is all I have left, but it's enough to crush you.
Take your best shot.
Well, look who's here.
Welcome to my world.
Are you scared?
I'm remaining calm, thank you.
I just wanted to return this.
I found it among the new books and naturally I thought of you.
Cool.
Thanks.
Well, I'll see you anon.
Can't get out of here fast enough, can you?
Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around computers than I used to be.
Well, it was your book that started all the trouble, not a computer.
Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?
The smell.
Computers don't smell, Rupert.
I know.
Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is.
A certain flower or a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten.
Books smell musty and rich.
The knowledge gained from a computer is It has no no texture, no context.
It's there and then it's gone.
If it's to last, then the getting of knowledge should be tangible.
It should be smelly.
Well, you really are an old-fashioned boy, aren't you?
Well, I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear.
That's not where I dangle it.
Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
We three?
It'll be fun.
Yeah, Willow.
Fun?
Remember fun?
That thing where you smile?
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm just thinking about - Malcolm?
- Malcolm Moloch Whatever he's called.
The one boy that's really liked me and he's a demon robot.
- What does that say about me?
- It doesn't say anything about you.
- I mean, I thought I was really falling - Hey, did you forget?
The one boy I've had the hots for here turned out to be a vampire.
And the teacher I had a crush on?
Giant praying mantis.
That's true.
That's life on the Hellmouth.
Let's face it.
None of us are ever gonna have a happy, normal relationship.
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
In every generation there is a Chosen One.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.
She is the Slayer.
I will be whole.
I will be new.
Thank you, Cordelia.
- That's going to be lovely.
- But I didn't do the part with the sparklers.
We'll save that for the dress rehearsal.
Lisa?
Please!
- If it isn't the great producer.
- Had to see this to believe it.
Oh, you three.
The school talent show.
How ever did you finagle such an assignment?
Our new F√ºhrer, Mr Snyder.
I think they call them principals now.
He thought I should have more contact with the students.
I tried to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimise that contact, but he would have none of it.
Giles, into every generation is born one who must run the annual talentless show.
You cannot escape your destiny.
If you had any shred of decency, you would have participated.
Or at least helped.
Nah.
I think I'll take on your traditional role, and watch.
- And mock.
- And laugh.
OK.
I think maybe we better leave our Mr Giles to this business he calls show.
Principal Snyder.
So, we think school events are stupid and we think authority figures are to be made fun of?
No, no, we don't.
Unless you do.
And we think our afternoon classes are optional?
- All three of you left campus yesterday.
- But we were fighting a demon - Fighting?
- Not fighting.
No, we left to avoid fighting.
Real antisocial types.
You need to integrate into this school, people.
I think I just found three eager new participants for the talent show.
- What?
- No.
Please?
I've been watching you three.
Always getting into one scrape.
We're really sorry, but about the talent show, you can't make us!
My predecessor, Mr Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense.
But he was eaten.
You're in my world now.
And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.
Can I just mention that detention is a time-honoured form of punishment?
I know the three of you will come up with a wonderful act for us to watch.
And mock.
And laugh at.
No!
No.
Thank you.
Eugh!
A dummy.
Yeeow!
Mime?
!
I think dummies are cute.
You don't?
They give me the wig.
Ever since I was little.
What happened?
I saw a dummy.
It gave me the wig.
There really wasn't a story there.
Hi, I'm Morgan.
And I'm Sid.
Hey, Morgan, would you like to tell some jokes?
Would I!
As a matter of fact, it is!
It's also a wood nose and a wood mouth.
- I didn't sleep at all last night.
- All right, time out.
Let's stop this before someone gets hurt.
Kid, you are the worst.
Even I can see your lips move.
Come on, Sid, you're spoiling my act.
I worked on these jokes for weeks.
You call those jokes?
My jockey shorts are made out of better material.
And they're edible!
You see?
I'm sure you three can come up with something equally exciting.
Is anybody there?
Hello?
Hello?
I will be flesh!
I reach into the hat and out comes Uh, has anybody seen a rabbit?
- I can't do this.
- Xander, come on.
I can't!
I have my pride.
OK, I don't have a lot of my pride, but I have enough so that I can't do this.
A dramatic scene is the easiest way to get through the talent show because it doesn't require an actual talent.
But we have talent.
We can do stuff.
- Buffy, uh - What can I do?
Slay vampires on stage?
Maybe in a funny way.
Willow, you can do stuff.
Uh, the piano.
- You play?
- A little.
Cool.
You could play and we could attempt to sing.
Oh, in front of other people?
Then, no, I don't play.
What happened to corporal punishment?
Mm-mm-mm.
Look at the goodies.
Morgan, you're really getting good.
- Where did you come up with that voice?
- It's kind of an imitation of my dad.
- Sounds real.
- It is real.
I'm the one with the talent here.
The kid's dead weight.
How about you and I do a little rehearsing on our own, honey?
Hey!
You know what they say: once you go wood, nothing's as good.
OK, Morgan, we get the joke.
Horny dummy, ha-ha, very funny.
But you should consider some new shtick, unless you want your prop ending up as a Duraflame log!
Kids today need discipline.
It's an unpopular word these days: discipline.
I know Principal Flutie would have said kids need understanding, kids are human beings.
That's the kind of liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.
I think, perhaps, it was a little more complex than that.
This place has quite a reputation.
Suicide, missing persons, spontaneous cheerleader combustion.
You can't put up with that.
You gotta keep an eye on the bad element.
Like those three.
Kids!
I don't like them.
From now on you're going to see a very different Sunnydale High.
A tight ship.
Clean, orderly, and quiet.
- It was Emily.
- Emily?
Dancer Emily?
Oh, man.
I hate this school.
It must have happened after dress rehearsals.
There was a cross-country meet.
She never showed up for it.
- Vampire?
- I think not.
Giles, share.
What happened?
- Her heart was removed.
- Yikes.
Does that mean anything to you?
Besides "ewww"!
There are various demons which feed off human hearts, but But demons have claws and teeth.
They got no use for a big old knife.
- Which very likely makes our murderer - Human.
Did I mention I hate this school?
So Emily was killed by a regular human person?
The evidence certainly points that way.
No, wait.
I'm not buying, you guys.
Remember the Hellmouth?
Mystical activity is totally rife here.
This, to me, says demon.
I'd like to think you're right.
A demon is a creature of evil, pure and simple.
A person driven to kill is It's more complex.
And the creep factor is also heightened.
It could be anyone.
It could be me.
It's not, though.
Demon or no, we have investigating to do.
I suggest we start with your talent show compatriots.
One may have been the last to see her alive.
I didn't know her well.
There's a dancer-band rivalry.
- Heard about that.
- But I did speak to her the day that - Yesterday.
- How did she seem?
Happy.
She was psyched to be in the show.
She was a really good dancer.
Here, pick a card.
No, wait, wait, wait!
Not that one.
Pick this one.
Remember the last time you saw her?
- She was talking to someone.
- Who?
That smart guy, the one with the dummy.
What's his name?
- Morgan?
- Yeah, that's it.
- He was acting kinda strange.
- Strange, how?
It's just such a tragedy for me.
- Emma was like my best friend.
- Emily.
Well, Morgan's just strange.
He's always rubbing his head a lot and moaning.
- Especially the other day.
- He seemed paranoid, looking at everyone.
I think I saw him arguing with his dummy.
All I can think is it could have been me!
We can dream.
Right now, you and me gotta be on the lookout.
Figure out who's gonna be next.
How are we supposed to Hi.
Hello.
I was just working on throwing my voice.
Uh, Morgan, did you notice anything weird going on around here yesterday?
Weird?
What do you mean?
With Emily.
Did she say anything to you?
Was she arguing with anyone?
No.
She was dancing.
- Sid and I were talking.
- Talking?
Rehearsing.
So you didn't notice anything weird at Morgan, are you OK?
Look, sweetheart, he answered your question.
Now leave him alone.
OK, Morgan.
How about talking to me yourself now?
He's said all he's gonna say.
It's OK, Sid.
We're done.
I'm sorry.
Look, I didn't mean to make you mad.
No, I'm It's him!
He's We have to go.
Cute couple.
Next time we split up, someone else is on Cordie detail.
We came close to having another organ donor.
I had more luck.
Everyone I talked to pointed their fingers at the same person.
- Morgan?
- Morgan.
- We have a winner.
- I fear I was led to the same conclusion.
Well, what do we do?
We wanna bring him to justice.
We could set up a sting operation where we get him to confess.
- I should wear a wire!
- Whoa, hey, guys.
All we know is that Morgan is a Grade A weirdo.
That doesn't lead to murderer.
- The guy talks to his puppet.
- And for his puppet.
Yeah, but what about the whole "it's a demon" theory?
I'm looking into that, but my investigation is somewhat hampered by life in the theatre.
Uh, priority check, Giles?
Talent show.
Murder.
Yeah, we can't do the talent show.
I'm not able to think it.
Principal Snyder is watching us all closely.
If he chooses, he can make all our lives difficult.
A slayer cannot afford that.
We will find this murderer, but in the meantime the show must go on.
- This is so unfair.
- Buffy, you watch Morgan.
- See if there's anything in his locker.
- Like a heart?
Or something.
- All right.
- I'll pull up his locker number.
Can I still wear a wire?
OK.
Two to the left, three to the right.
Principal Snyder!
- What are you doing?
- Uh, looking for something.
School hours are over.
You, therefore, should be gone.
And I'm going any minute now.
There are things I will not tolerate.
Students loitering on campus after school, horrible murders with hearts being removed.
And also smoking.
Well, I don't do any of those things.
Not ever.
There's something going on with you.
I'll figure it out sooner or later.
Do you need something here?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Um, a friend wanted me to get something out of his case.
He must have taken it and forgotten to tell me.
Get along home now.
It's late.
No, I can't do it!
It's the only way.
- I don't want - She's the one!
- But - You saw what she did.
How strong she is.
- I know, but - She's the last.
Just this one more and I'll be free.
- I won't.
- I will!
Hi, hon.
How's it going with the talent show?
It'll be over soon.
It can't be that bad.
l, for one, am looking forward to seeing your act.
Seeing?
In the sense of actually attending?
- Of course!
- Uh-uh, no, Mom.
You can't.
If I know you're out there watching, I'll freeze up.
Stage fright.
But I wanna support you.
Look, Mom, if you really love me and wanna show your support, you'll stay away.
Far away!
Honey, is there something bothering you?
I mean, besides your fabulous debut.
Nothing.
There's just a lot going on right now.
Well, get some sleep.
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- Good plan.
- What is it?
- In the bed, in the covers, there's something!
Where?
There's something there.
Well, there's nothing there now.
Did you have a nightmare?
No, there's some There is Yeah.
You're probably right.
- I'm sorry I got you up.
- Don't worry.
I was dreaming about bills.
Sweetheart, you shouldn't go to sleep with the window open.
I didn't.
And my lovely assistant steps into the box.
And behold!
You were supposed to leave.
I don't understand why I have to follow Brett and his stupid band.
Because we have to clear their equipment before the finale.
But the mood.
It'll be all wrong.
My song is about dignity and human feelings and personal hygiene or something.
Anyway it's sappy, and no one is gonna be feeling sappy after all that rock'n'roll.
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, your hair There's something wrong with my hair?
Oh, my God.
Xander was right.
It worked like a charm.
Hello.
You look a bit worse for, uh What exactly are you the worse for?
- Where's Morgan?
- I haven't seen him.
- Did he do something to you?
- No, it was his Sid, the dummy.
OK, everyone look at me like I'm in a bunny suit cos that's how stupid I feel saying this.
I think Sid was in my room last night.
- With Morgan?
- No.
He was alone and alive.
- Did you see him?
- I saw something.
It ran across my floor and it attacked me.
Attacked you?
How?
- It pounced on my face.
- Like a cat?
Yeah, exactly.
But when I turned the lights on I think it went out my window.
- Like a cat?
- Yeah.
No!
It was Sid, the dummy.
Or the nightmare of somebody who had dummies on her mind.
You did say they creep you out.
Excuse me, can I have some support here?
I'm notjust some crazy person.
I'm the Slayer.
The Dummy Slayer?
There's nothing funny about that.
Well, on the side of the "Morgan's just crazy" theory, there is Well, Morgan.
I'd like to see Morgan without his better half.
Bet he could tell me something.
Oh, if it's any consolation, I may have found a possible demon culprit.
There's this reference in here to a brotherhood of seven demons who take the form of the unhumans.
Every seven years these demons need human organs, a brain and a heart, to maintain their humanity, or they revert back to their original form which is slightly less appealing.
So Morgan could still be the guy, only Demon Morgan, instead of Crazy Morgan.
Except that these demons are preternaturally strong, and Morgan is Well, he seems to be getting weaker every day.
As a result of this, President Monroe put forth the eponymous - meaning "named after oneself" - Monroe Doctrine, which, in one sense, established the US as a local peacekeeper Looks like someone digs you.
That's adorable.
You and the dummy could tour in the freak show.
OK, who can tell me how Spain responded to this policy?
Morgan?
Morgan?
What?
Morgan has other things on his mind.
- Give me your puppet.
- I'll put him away.
You'll get it back after school.
OK, then, in the first part of the 19th century I'm still watching you.
Morgan, that is enough!
- Mrs Jackson?
- Morgan.
- You said you'd give me - Oh, of course.
You know, I wanted to ask you.
Is everything OK?
- At home?
Here at school?
- Yeah, it's great.
I feel like you've become a little detached.
You're one of the brightest kids I've seen, but lately it seems like you're not all there.
- Don't let other things get in the way.
- OK!
Can I get Sid now?
Sure.
- It's gone.
- Gone?
What do you mean gone?
- Where could he have gone?
- I put it right here.
He knew to wait for me.
He knew I'd be back.
- What do you mean "he"?
- What did you do with him?
Where is he?
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I took it out of Mrs Jackson's cupboard.
You said you wanted to speak to Morgan alone.
And, well, Morgan's alone ..
and Sid's with me.
Hi, Buffy.
Hi, Willow.
Would you like to hear some off-colourjokes?
- I don't think you should be doing that.
- What?
Come on!
- I'm not real.
- Xander, quit it!
He's not real.
I think our demonstration proves that Sid is wood.
Now, why don't you go find Morgan and prove he's whatever he is?
- I imagine he's looking for his puppet.
- I'll go find Morgan.
- You watch the dummy.
- Bye-bye now.
I'm inanimate.
Redrum!
Redrum!
- What do we do with him?
- Hey!
I'll keep him company.
Willow, we have some hunting of our own to do.
Once again I'm banished to the demon section on the card catalogue.
You concentrate on reanimation theory.
I'll do organ harvesting.
- Unless you'd prefer - That's OK.
You can have the organs.
So I guess it's just you and me, huh?
That looks more comfortable.
Morgan?
!
Morgan?
Principal Snyder.
- Looking for something?
- Have you seen Morgan Shay?
You know, with everything that's been going on recently, I'm not sure how safe it is for a girl like yourself to be here.
Alone.
Well, I was just leaving.
And I know how to take care of myself.
All right, then.
Look what I found in "Toys and Magic".
"On rare occasions inanimate objects of human quality, such as dolls, already mystically possessed of consciousness, have acted upon their desire to become human by harvesting organs".
- Emily's heart.
- Morgan's dummy.
- What is it?
- He's gone!
Sid's gone!
What?
Oh!
Morgan?
Morgan.
The demon's got himself a brain.
Whoever's out there, I'm gonna hurt you!
Badly!
If you'll just give me a minute.
You win.
Now you can take your heart and your brain and move on.
They would have made great trophies.
- That would have been justice.
- Yeah, except for one thing.
You lost and now you'll never be human.
Yeah, well, neither will you.
What?
This is what I do.
I hunt demons.
Yeah.
You wouldn't know it to look at me.
Let's just say there was me, there was a really mean demon, there was a curse, and the next thing I know I'm not me any more.
I'm sitting on some guy's knee with his hand up my shirt.
And ever since then you've been a living dummy?
The kid here was right.
I should have picked you to team up with.
- But I didn't because - Because you thought I was the demon.
Who can blame me for thinking?
Look at you.
You're strong, athletic, limber, nubile.
I'm back.
In any case, now that this demon's got the heart and brain, he gets to keep the human form he's in for another seven years.
It's nice to have someone else explain all these things.
There were seven of these guys.
I've killed six.
If I can get the last one, the curse will be lifted and I'll be free.
I'm sure it's someone in that stupid talent show.
But now the demon will be moving on.
- So if someone's missing from the show - We'll know who our demon is.
- The show!
- What?
It's going to start!
I should be there.
Pull everyone's addresses.
If they're not there, we can find them at home.
You, get 'em on stage.
Form the Power Circle.
Then we can see who's a no-show.
- Um, the what?
- The Power Circle.
You get everyone together, you get 'em revved up.
Right.
How'd he ever get that gig?
I can't go out there.
All those people staring at me and judging me like I'm some kind of Buffy!
- What if I mess up?
- Cordelia, there's an adage that if you're feeling nervous, you should imagine the audience are in their underwear.
Euch!
Even Mrs Franklin?
- Oh.
- Perhaps not.
All right, we'll assemble on the stage in five minutes for the power thing.
So what's your deal, kid?
- I don't figure you for a demon hunter.
- I'm a vampire slayer.
You?
You're the Slayer?
Damn.
I knew a slayer in the thirties.
Korean chick.
Very hot.
We're talking muscle tone.
Man, we had some times.
Hey, that was pre-dummy, all right?
I was a guy.
So, you kill the demon and the curse is lifted, right?
- That's the drill.
- You don't turn into a prince, do you?
- I mean, your body - Is dust and bones.
- When I say free - You mean dead.
Don't get sniffly on me, sis.
I've lived a lot longer than most demon hunters.
Or slayers, for that matter.
Of course, if you want to snuggle up and comfort me So that horny-dummy thing really isn't an act, is it?
- Nope.
- Yuck.
- Is everybody here?
- I think so.
OK, here's our line-up.
Quickly, everyone.
Um, Power Circle.
Well, that's that, then.
Everybody, get ready.
That's it?
All right.
Hold on.
- No one's missing.
- So the demon isn't here?
It seems not.
Tell the others.
It's curtain.
I must get the show running.
- Right.
- Right.
Sid?
Sid?
I'm never gonna stop washing my hands.
So the dummy tells us that he's a demon hunter and we're like "Fine, la-la-la-la".
He takes off and now there's a brain.
Does anybody feel they've been Keyser Soze'd?
Sid's on the level, I'm sure.
But why would the demon reject the brain?
I thought Morgan was a smart kid.
He was.
Look at his grades.
All A's.
He was even taking college classes.
- Wait a second.
- What?
- All these sick days.
- He was out for half the year.
Check the school nurse's file.
Look at this.
"In case of emergency, contact Dr Dale Liggette, California Institute of Neurosurgery, Cancer Ward".
- Brain cancer?
- That's why he had all the headaches.
So whatever's out there still needs an intelligent brain.
So I'm safe.
And it's gonna be looking for the smartest person around.
What?
If you calibrated the units of weight, you could calculate the maximum velocity achieved before the point of impact.
Gee, Mr Giles!
You're smart.
Could you do me a favour?
What could a demon possibly want from me?
What's the square root of 841?
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry.
As long as you're with us, that demon won't get what he wants.
- Oh, my.
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Are you sure no one else can help you out?
- My assistant got sick.
You won't have to say anything.
Lie down.
How exactly does it work?
A good magician never tells his secrets.
We haven't got much time.
This is ridiculous.
We can't wait for him to come to us.
We have to figure out who we're dealing with.
- I still vote dummy.
- No!
OK, so we ruled out all the people in the talent show.
Because they were all there, but that's before we found the brain.
Right.
So it probably is one of them.
Giles doesn't know it.
He's with them all now.
Look, Giles can handle himself.
I mean, he is really smart.
Giles!
- Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
- No.
No, this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just come pouring out.
- What exactly is the trick?
- Trick?
Mark?
Mark?
- Where are the keys?
- Mark's got it.
Willow!
Hurry!
How do you lock this thing?
What's happening?
I found you!
Let go!
I must say, all of you, your timing is impeccable.
And now for the big finish.
What are you doing?
It's not enough.
He'll come back.
You have to get the heart, then all of this will be over.
- Let me.
- I got it.
Thanks.
It's over.
I don't get it.
What is it?
Avant-garde?
O ruler of my country, Oedipus, you see our company around the altar, and l, the priest of Zeus.
Ha-ha.
They prophesied that I should kill my father, but he is dead and hidden in the soil.
But surely I must fear my mother's bed.
Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus, unhappy Oedipus.
That is all I can call you and all that I ever shall call you.
Darkness!
And horror of darkness!
Unfolding restless visitant sped by an ill wind in haste.
Madness and Madness and stabbing pain and and um, oh Oh Memory of, uh ill deeds I have done.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
In every generation, there is a Chosen One.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness.
She is the Slayer.
No!
No!
- No!
- Yes.
It's time to get up for school.
- Mom?
- Are you all right?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm I'm fine.
School!
Great!
- You wanna go to school?
- Sure.
Why not?
OK!
Good day to buy that lottery ticket.
I spoke with your father.
- He is coming, right?
- You're on for this weekend.
Good.
- So do you see your dad a lot?
- Not a whole lot.
He's still in LA.
He only comes down for weekends sometimes.
When did they get divorced?
Well, it wasn't finalised till last year but they were separated before that.
It must have been harsh.
Yeah.
That's the word you're looking for.
I mean, they were really good about it around me, but still!
My parents don't even bicker.
Sometimes they glare.
- Do you know why your folks split up?
- I didn't ask.
They just stopped getting along.
I'm sure I was a big help, with all the slaying and everything.
I was in so much trouble.
I was a big mess.
I'm sure that's not why he left.
No.
And he still comes down on weekends.
Sometimes.
Hello!
Doofus!
You're in my light.
Wendell, what is wrong with you?
Don't you know she is the centre of the universe and we merely revolve around her?
Why don't you revolve out of my light?
- Uh Wendell was in Cordelia's light.
- I'm so ashamed.
Why is she so Evita-like?
- I think it's the hair.
- It weighs heavy on the cerebral cortex.
- Was there any homework?
- It's active listening today.
Cool!
What's active listening?
- That would be the homework.
- Chapter five.
"Active Listening".
You put on your big ears and really focus on the other person.
Ms Tishler demonstrated it yesterday.
With you.
- She was wearing that tight sweater.
- Oh!
The midnight-blue angora!
- See, I was listening.
- All right!
Take your seats.
In a moment we will choose partners and practise what we read about in chapter five.
Good, Xander, that's the spirit.
Before we do, let's review.
Isaacson's research led him to conclude that one of our most fundamental needs, after food and shelter, is to be heard.
Wendell, read the first two paragraphs on page 78, where Isaacson describes the improvement active listening brought to some special-needs clients.
Help!
Please!
Get 'em off of me!
Help!
Help!
Get 'em off of me!
Help me!
Ah!
Please, help me!
Sorry about that.
Fear is a wonderful thing!
It is the most powerful force in the human world.
Not love, not hate.
Fear!
When you were a mortal boy, what did you fear?
Monsters.
We are defined by the things we fear.
This symbol, these two planks of wood, it confounds me.
Suffuses me with mortal dread.
But fear is in the mind.
I like pain.
It can be controlled.
If I can face my fear, it cannot master me.
Something is happening above.
Something new.
- A powerful, psychic force.
Do you feel it?
- I feel change.
Change?
Yes.
For the worse.
- You're awfully quiet this morning.
- I didn't sleep well.
I'll say!
I came in twice.
You were yelling in your sleep.
- Do you know what you were dreaming?
- Not really.
My bag!
I packed it for the weekend and I forgot it.
You and your dad can come and get your bag.
It's not an international crisis.
OK.
Yeah, I just meant to bring it.
He's picking me up here, right?
At 3.30?
Are you worried your father won't show?
No.
Not really.
Should I be?
Of course not!
I know it's a hard situation You just have to remember that your father adores you.
No more than I do, by the way.
Goodbye.
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Buffy!
We've been looking for you.
- We have?
About the spiders.
Did you talk to Giles about Oh, the spiders!
Willow's been What's the word I'm looking for?
- "Insane" about what happened yesterday.
- I don't like spiders, OK?
Their furry bodies and their sticky webs.
What do they need all those legs for, anyway?
I'll tell you.
For crawling across your face in the middle of the night.
Urgh!
How do they not ruffle you?
I'm sorry.
I'm unruffled by spiders.
If a bunch of Nazis crawled all over me - It was pretty intense.
- Thank you.
The Hellmouth - mystical convergence, supernatural monsters.
Been there.
- You're a little blas√© there.
- I'm not worried.
If there's something bad out there, we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party.
Thanks for having confidence in me.
You da man, Buff.
But we're still caring about the spiders here.
Let's not forget the spiders.
Giles said he was gonna look it up.
- Giles?
- Maybe he's in the faculty room.
Hey, Giles?
Wakey, wakey!
I was, uh, in the stacks.
I got lost.
Did you find any theories on spiders coming outta books?
Big hairy crawly It's funny if you're me.
I couldn't find anything particularly illuminating.
Um I think perhaps you'd best have a chat with Wendell himself.
OK.
If he can still talk.
Hey, Wendell.
How are you?
Huh?
Are you OK?
Good talking to you, man.
Do you guys want something?
- We thought you might wanna talk.
- You know, yesterday, with the spiders?
I don't know what to say about that.
You saw 200 insects.
You gonzoed.
Anybody would have.
They're not insects.
They're arachnids.
- From the Middle East?
- Spiders are arachnids.
They have eight legs.
Insects only have six.
Why does everyone make that mistake?
Don't know.
Has anything like this ever happened before?
- When?
- Lots of times.
Euch!
You must hate spiders more than I do.
I don't hate spiders.
I love 'em!
They hate me.
- I hope you studied for the history test.
- What history test?
- The one in fourth period right now.
- There's a history test?
Nobody told me there's a history test!
I OK.
I will catch up with you guys later.
- What do you mean, you love spiders?
- It is platonic, right?
I had the best collection in the tri-county area.
Browns and tarantulas and black widows.
Then my folks shipped me off to wilderness camp.
All my brother had to do was maintain their habitats.
Instead he left their heat lamp on for a week.
When I came home they were all dead.
That's when the nightmares started.
- The nightmares?
- It's always the same.
I'm sitting in my classroom.
The teacher asks me to read something.
I open up my book and there they are.
They're comin' after me.
- Can you blame them after what I did?
- And that's how it happens, every time?
Yesterday, in class, I thought I'd just nodded off again.
But then everyone else started screaming, too.
You don't know where class is, do you?
Hardly a shocker.
You've always cut history.
Well, I was there the first day I think.
It's in here.
I've cut class.
I've read no assignments.
How am I gonna pass this test?
Blind luck?
At least I know my name.
Well, they both got detention, which is completely unfair since Shawn started it.
Anyway, it means we can't do the movie.
I'm gonna take a break.
You shouldn't go in there.
Lucky 19.
Room 3016.
- Do you know the girl?
- To say hi to.
Laura's nice enough.
- Nobody saw who attacked her?
- I was rather hoping that Laura did.
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi.
I hope we're not intruding.
That's OK.
I don't wanna be left alone.
You understand we're anxious to make sure this doesn't happen again.
Can you tell us what happened?
I was in the basement.
I went down for a smoke.
There was someone there.
Someone you knew?
I've never seen anything like it.
It?
Can you describe it?
Hey, that's OK.
Don't worry about it.
Yes, you you just rest now.
You know if you remember anything you can tell us.
Even if it may seem weird.
She needs her rest now.
Lucky 19.
I'm sorry?
It's what he said right before He said "Lucky 19".
That's weird, right?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Feel better.
Take care.
Doctor, is she gonna be all right?
- Are you family?
- Friends.
She'll recover.
She's got a couple of shattered bones, a little internal bleeding.
- She got off pretty easy.
- Easy?
- Have you looked up the word lately?
- Well, the first one's still in a coma.
- First what?
- First victim.
They found him a week ago.
Same MO as the girl, only he's in worse shape.
If he doesn't wake up soon Somebody's gotta stop this guy.
Somebody will.
Listen.
I'm not afraid of him.
If he wants to fight, then I'm takin' him down.
I'm not backin' off of this.
This is about honour!
I'm just saying, Wendell had a dream and then that exact thing happened.
Which is a fair wiggins, I admit, but does that tie in with Laura?
I don't know.
Maybe she dreamed about getting beat up.
We'll ask Buffy when she gets back from the hospital.
Oh, here's my little baby!
- Mom, what are you doin' here?
- How's my little?
Mom, don't kiss me in front of the guys!
It's embarrassing!
You cute little rascal It must be a coincidence.
Wendell finds a spider's nest.
We all wig because he dreamt about spiders.
So it may not be connected.
If there is a connection, it doesn't sound What?
Xander, what happened I don't know I was, uh dressed a minute ago!
It's a dream.
It's gotta be a dream.
Ow!
Wake up!
Ow!
Gotta wake up!
This can't be happening.
This can't be What's the word?
Oh, um I've got back issues of the papers.
Um, I'm trying to do some research.
- Did you find anything?
- I don't know.
You don't know if you didn't find anything?
- I'm having a problem.
- What is it?
I can't read.
What do you mean?
You can read three languages.
Five, actually on a normal day.
The words here don't make any sense.
It's gibberish!
- That's him.
- Who?
The kid I've been seeing around school.
"Billy Palmer was found unconscious after his Kitty League game Saturday".
"Doctors describe his condition as critical".
When was this published?
Last week.
He's in a coma in intensive care.
This is the boy from the hospital!
The first victim?
You've seen him around the school?
Yeah.
When the spiders got Wendell, and then in the history test.
I thought it was weird seeing this kid, but I forgot about it.
He's been in a coma for a week.
How can this be possible?
Am I knowledge girl now?
Explanations are your terrain.
There's astral projection.
The theory that while one sleeps one has an astral body which can travel through time and space.
Billy's in a coma.
That's like sleep, right?
In a manner of speaking.
Although one doesn't always awake from a coma.
Could I be seeing Billy's asteroid body?
Astral body.
And I don't know.
As usual, one doesn't have a lot of information to work with.
Lucky 19.
There you are!
I've been looking everywhere.
Why aren't you in class?
Dad, you're supposed to pick me up after school.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, I need to talk to you.
- Something is wrong.
Is it Mom?
- No, no, it's not your mother.
She's fine.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Privately?
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Dad, this is Mr Giles, the librarian.
This is my dad, Hank Summers.
- My pleasure.
- Likewise.
I'll be back.
I came early because there's something I needed to tell you.
About your mother and me.
Why we split up.
You always told me I know we always said it was because we'd just grown too far apart.
Yeah.
Isn't that true?
Come on, honey.
Let's Let's sit down.
You're old enough now to know the truth.
- Was there someone else?
- No.
No, it was nothing like that.
- Then what was it?
- It was you.
Me?
Having you.
Raising you, seeing you every day.
Do you have any idea what that's like?
What?
Gosh, you don't even see what's right in front of your face, do you?
Big surprise there.
All you ever think about is yourself.
You get in trouble.
You embarrass us with all the crazy stunts you pull.
Do I have to go on?
No.
Please don't.
You're sullen and rude and you're not nearly as bright as I thought you were gonna be.
Let's be honest.
Could you stand to live in the same house with a daughter like that?
Why are you saying these things?
Because they're true.
I think that's the least we owe one another.
I don't think it's very mature getting blubbery when I'm just trying to be honest.
Speaking of which, I don't really get anything out of these weekends with you.
So what do you say we just don't do them any more?
I sure thought you'd turn out differently.
Red alert!
Where's Buffy?
She just stepped out.
Her father came by.
He needed to talk to her.
Where are your other clothes?
Oh, don't I wish I had the answer to that question.
Xander kind of found himself in front of our class not wearing much of anything.
- Except my underwear!
- Yeah!
It was really - ..
bad.
It was a bad thing.
- "Bad thing"?
I was naked.
"Bad thing" doesn't cover it.
Everyone staring?
I would hate to have everyone paying attention to me like that.
With nudity!
It was a total nightmare.
Well, yes, Xander!
It's your nightmare.
Except the part with me waking up going "It's all a dream".
- It happened.
- Like it happened to Wendell.
That thing with the spiders?
Wendell had a recurring dream about that.
I dreamt that I got lost in the stacks and I couldn't Of course!
- Our dreams are coming true?
- Dreams?
Nightmares.
Our nightmares are coming true.
- So why is this happening?
- Billy.
Well, that explanation was shorter than usual.
It's Billy!
- Who's Billy?
- The boy in the local hospital.
He was beaten.
He's in a coma.
I think he's crossed over from the nightmare world he's trapped in.
And he brought the nightmare world with him?
- Thanks a bunch, Billy.
- How could he do that?
- It's easier when you live on a Hellmouth.
- Well, um we have to stop it.
And soon.
Or else everyone in Sunnydale's gonna be facing their own worst nightmares.
I don't understand!
This can't be happening.
I was just at the salon!
Oh, my God!
Billy?
Are you Billy Palmer?
I'm Billy.
Why are you here?
Did something bad happen to you after your game?
Something bad?
I I don't remember.
Do you remember playing baseball?
Yeah.
I play second base.
Are you Lucky 19?
That's what he calls me.
Who?
The ugly man.
He wants to kill me.
And he hurt that girl.
- Why does he want to kill you, Billy?
- He's - Billy, it's OK.
Just tell me.
- He's here!
Buffy doesn't know about this.
Given the stuff she dreams about, we must find her.
- It might be faster if we split up to find her.
- Good idea.
Faster, but ..
not really safer.
- Billy!
- I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
- Who is he?
- He's the ugly man.
He's too strong.
I can't fight him.
My friends can help us.
- We have to hide.
- No, he'll find us!
But we have to hide.
That's how it happens.
We hide and then he comes.
No!
What are you doin'?
No!
You don't understand!
I don't wanna go!
I'm not even on the chess team!
I swear I'm not!
- Willow!
- No!
Willow!
Buffy?
Hello?
Buffy?
I'm not afraid.
You'd think I'd be afraid, but I'm not.
All right!
Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness.
This is my lucky day!
I was sure this led to the library.
They're just playing.
What is it?
What's bothering you?
Baseball.
When you lose, it's bad.
Did you lose your game last week?
It was my fault.
Why was it your fault?
I missed a ball when I should've caught it.
You missed one ball and the whole game was your fault?
What, you were the only one playing?
There wasn't eight other people on your team?
He said it was my fault.
Who said?
- Did he hurt you after the game?
- Can we go and find your friends?
Sure.
OK.
OK.
We can go round the cafeteria.
Bad idea.
This way!
Come on!
What just happened?
- Is this where your friends are?
- No, it's not.
Man, I thought you weren't gonna show!
Aldo is beside himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, may we present two of the world's greatest singers!
I hope you're warmed up.
It's an ugly crowd tonight.
All the reviewers showed up.
All the way from Firenze, Italy, the one and only Aldo Gianfranco!
And all the way from Sunnydale, California, the world's finest soprano, Willow Rosenberg!
But I I didn't learn the words.
My turn?
I love these bars!
A Chocolate Hurricane is the best!
I haven't had one of these since my ..
sixth ..
birthday.
I don't see the ugly man.
I also don't know where the sun and rest of the world went.
Look at this.
I guess they're gonna bury somebody.
I wonder who died.
Nobody died!
What's the fun of burying someone if they're already dead?
- You.
- So, this is the Slayer.
You're prettier than the last one.
This isn't real.
You can't be free.
You still don't understand, do you?
I am free because you fear it.
Because you fear it, the world is crumbling.
Your nightmares are made flesh.
You have little Billy to thank for that.
- This is a dream.
- A dream is a wish your heart makes.
This is real life.
Come on, Slayer.
What are you afraid of?
- No!
- How about being buried alive?
Please, no!
Don't!
Please, no!
Don't!
Don't!
Somebody help me!
Please, no!
Please, no!
Help me!
Don't!
Help me!
- Did you find Buffy?
- I had to sing.
Very bad.
To sing.
Come on.
Let's find the others.
- What happened to you?
- Remember my sixth birthday party?
Oh, yeah.
When the clown chased you and you got so scared that you Oh No sign of Buffy?
You were a lousy clown!
You made pathetic balloon animals.
Anyone can make a giraffe.
I feel good.
I feel liberated.
You seem to be the only one.
Things are getting worse.
Reality will soon be in the realm of nightmares.
- What do we do?
- We could try and wake Billy.
- We can't leave without Buffy.
- Agreed, but who knows where she went?
Excuse me.
When did they put a cemetery in across the street?
And when did they make it night over there?
Whose nightmare is this?
It's mine.
I failed ..
in my duty to protect you.
I should have been more cautious.
Taken more time to train you.
But you were so gifted.
And the evil was so great.
I'm sorry.
Buffy?
- I thought I was dead!
- Buffy, your face!
Oh, God.
- Buffy - Don't look at me!
You never told me you dreamt of becoming a vampire.
This isn't a dream.
No, it's not.
But there's a chance that we can make it go away.
This all comes from Billy.
If we can only wake him up, I believe that the nightmares will stop and reality will return, but we must do it now.
I need you to hold together long enough to help us.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
I think I can.
Thank you.
Well, we'd better hurry cos I'm getting hungry.
That is, uh ajoke, right?
- You're sure it will go back once he's awake?
- Oh, half-positive.
Well, how do we wake Billy up?
What if we can't?
Willow, do shut up.
Doctor!
Is the boy, Billy, still here?
My hands What now?
Billy!
- Billy!
- That won't work.
Billy.
Uh Billy, you have to wake up.
No.
I told her.
I have to hide.
- Why?
From what?
- From him.
- Oh, man.
What do we do?
- I think I know.
Whatever it is, it better be soon.
Glad you showed up.
I'm having a really bad day.
- Lucky 19!
- Scary!
I'll tell you something, though.
There are a lot scarier things than you.
And I'm one of them.
Is he dead?
Come here, Billy.
- I I don't - You have to do the rest.
What are they doing?
I get it.
No more hiding.
Hey, he's waking up.
I had the strangest dream.
You were in it and you.
Who are you people?
Let's get a doctor.
Oh Billy's got company.
I'm his Kitty League coach.
I come by here every day, just hoping against hope that he's gonna wake up soon.
He's, uh my lucky 19.
So, um how is he?
He's awake.
What?
You blamed him for losing the game.
So you caught up with him afterwards.
- What are you talkin' about?
- You said it was my fault that we lost.
It wasn't my fault.
There's eight other players on the team.
You know that.
Nice going.
I can't believe a Kitty League coach would do that.
You obviously haven't played Kitty League.
I'm surprised it wasn't a parent.
I'm just glad he's behind bars where he belongs.
That was kind of heroic, Xander.
Grabbing him an' all.
I just did what anybody would have.
If you wanna label it heroic Hi!
Have a killer weekend, guys!
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh, it's so good to see you!
- How was your day?
- Oh, you know.
Usual.
- Personal question?
- Yeah, shoot.
When Buffy was a vampire, you weren't still attracted to her, were you?
Willow, how can you I mean, that's really bent!
She was ..
grotesque.
Still dug her, huh?
I'm sick.
I need help.
Don't I know it!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
In every generation there is a Chosen One.
She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness.
She is the Slayer.
I just love springtime.
I just love springtime.
- Me in bright spring fashions.
- Spring training.
- Me at the end-of-school dance.
- The end of school.
Definitely my favourite time of year.
I am, of course, having my dress specially made.
Off-the-rack gives me hives.
Let me guess.
Blue, like your eyes!
My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller.
You two will look so fine together in the May Queen photo.
Well, I haven't been elected May Queen yet.
Behold, the weirdness.
You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this.
- Wow!
I'm not.
- Uh, for history class.
Mr Giles has this, like, hobby of collecting stuff, which he lent me for show and tell.
Did I mention it's for history class?
She is always hanging with that creepy librarian in that creepy library.
Hey, did I ever tell you about the time she attacked me at the Bronze?
I don't know why this school admits mentals like her.
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh"?
"If you poison us, do we not die"?
"And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge"?
OK.
So talk to me, people.
How does what Shylock says about being a Jew relate to our discussion about the anger of the outcast at society?
Cordelia?
How about colour me totally self-involved?
- Care to elaborate?
- Yeah.
With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine.
Like the whole world is about him.
He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of Antonio's flesh.
It's notjustice.
It's yicky!
But has Shylock suffered?
What's his place in Venice society?
- Well, everyone looked down on him.
- That is such a twinkie defence.
Shylock should get over himself.
People who think their problems are so huge craze me.
Like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike.
It was so traumatising for me, and she's trying to make it about her leg.
Like my pain meant nothing.
Cordelia's raised an interesting point which we'll pursue at a later time.
Um, Ms Miller?
Good observations today.
It's always exciting to know someone's done the reading.
Thanks.
I wanna talk to you about my final paper.
I'm real unfocused.
I have all these thoughts and I'm sure they all contradict each other.
I have your outline here, but why not stop by tomorrow?
We'll go over it then.
- Great.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- I'll see you then.
- OK, bye.
Harmony!
They called and said the dress is ready.
It's so great.
Mitch is gonna die.
Mitch, you going to the Bronze?
Later.
I'm pickin' up my tux first.
Gotta look sharp for the big dig.
Right.
You gotta look good on Cordelia's arm.
Oh, it's not her arm I'm looking to be on!
Who's there?
OK, fun time's over.
Come out.
Now remember who to vote for for May Queen, as in me.
Hi!
Isn't this the bomb?
I'm such a campaign strategist.
C?
For Cordelia?
No, C for Wilma, little brain.
Of course, C for Cordelia.
This way people will associate me with something sweet.
Here's a chocolate Oh, I don't think I need the loony-fringe vote.
Well, I don't even like chocolates.
OK, that was the lamest comeback ever.
- What's Cordelia up to?
- Bribery.
- She's desperate to be May Queen.
- Cordelia does love titles.
Oh, God.
Remember in sixth grade with the field trip?
- Right.
The guy with the antlers on his belt!
- "Be my deputy".
- And remember the hat?
- Oh, God, the hat!
Gee, it's fun that we're speaking in tongues.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was just we had this You had to be there.
- It's not even funny.
- Really.
Cordelia just has a history of trying too hard.
Yeah.
What kind of moron would wanna be May Queen, anyway?
I was.
- You what?
- At my old school.
Oh, so the good kind of moron would do that.
The, non-moron, I mean.
We didn't call it May Queen.
But we had the coronation and the dance and all that stuff.
- It was nice.
- You don't need that any more.
You got us.
"Be my deputy"!
Oh, God!
Guys, Mitch got whaled on!
I think he's Dead?
Of course not.
Dead!
What are you?
Ghouls?
There are no dead students here.
This week.
Clear back.
Make room.
- Mitch, what happened?
- I don't know.
I heard something.
I tried to grab a bat.
It hit me.
- What hit you?
- The bat.
By itself.
The thing was floating and it knocked me out.
I'd better check out the scene.
Where do you think you're going?
Mitch wanted me to get his comb.
He likes his comb.
I don't think Mitch needs his comb.
Mitch needs medical attention.
And you need to stay away from the crime scene.
Always sticking your nose in.
Sue?
What did you say?
Mitch was gonna sue the school?
Sue?
Who?
His dad's a powerful lawyer in Sunnydale.
- Hold on.
What have you two heard?
- His dad, the lawyer.
You don't know him?
Other lawyers call him "The Beast".
"Look"?
That's all it said?
Look at what?
Look at Mitch?
Maybe.
All I know is it's a message.
- And?
- Ah, here you are.
And monsters don't usually send messages.
It's crush, kill, destroy.
This was different.
- I'd have to say you're right.
- I love it when he says that.
Any theories?
It's a bit of a puzzle, really.
I've never heard of anyone attacked by a Ione baseball bat before.
Maybe it's a vampire bat.
I'm alone with that one, huh?
Well, assuming the bat is not possessed, there are a few possibilities to investigate.
Someone with telekinesis: the power to move objects at will.
An invisible creature, or possibly a poltergeist.
- A ghost?
- Yes, and a very angry one.
Yeah, I'd say!
The locker room was a real scene.
- If it's a ghost, we're talking about a dead kid.
- I guess so.
Why not compile a list of dead or missing kids?
Could be a good place to start.
And I'll research all the possibilities.
Xander, if you're not doing anything, would you like to help me?
What?
There's homework now?
- When did that happen?
- It's part of the glamour of vampire slayage.
- What part do you have?
- I'm gonna find out what I can about Mitch.
- I want that part.
- Fine.
You can do it.
Ask around.
Talk to his friends.
Talk to Cordelia.
Talk to Cordelia?
So, research, huh?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
- Cordelia, you weren't in fifth period.
- I went to the hospital.
Oh, Mitch.
How is he?
Will he be OK?
The doctor says he'll be fine.
They're gonna send him home tomorrow.
But you should have seen him lying there, all black and blue.
How will he look in our prom pictures?
How will I ever be able to show them to anyone?
They can do wonderful things with airbrushes these days.
You think?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you see Mitch?
He just broke up with Wendy and he's already nosing around.
It's shameless.
In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I'll take him on a test drive.
- Hey, guys.
- What do you want?
I just hope they can prop him up long enough to take the picture.
Cordelia, can I talk to you?
- Oh, great.
- Why is she always try Harmony!
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Clear back, everyone!
Give her some air.
You!
School nurse, now!
Oh, my ankle.
I think it's broken.
- What happened?
- Hey!
Who's the Principal here?
- What happened?
- She fell!
We were standing at the top of the stairs and she fell all by herself.
No, I was pushed!
- Ow!
- Don't sue.
Is anybody here?
Hey, who's here?
OK, I know someone's here.
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just wanna talk to you.
- Giles, have you touched a ghost?
- Uh, no.
From what I've heard, having one pass through you is a singular experience.
It's a It's a rather cold, amorphous feeling.
Makes your hair stand on end.
That's my problem.
I touched the thing, but it didn't go through me.
It bumped into me, and it wasn't cold.
- So we're talking about an invisible person?
- A girl.
She laughed.
A girl on campus with the ability to become invisible.
- That is so cool.
- Cool?
Yeah.
I'd give anything to be able to do that.
I wouldn't use my powers to beat people up, just to protect the girls' locker room.
It must be a fairly heady experience, having that ability.
How'd she get it?
Is she a witch?
Cos we can fight a witch.
Hm, Greek myths speak of cloaks of invisibility, but they're usually for the gods.
Research boy comes through with the knowledge.
- This girl's sort of petty for a god.
- She's got a grudge.
But why Harmony?
- And Mitch.
The common denominator is - Cordelia.
So what now?
- Tomorrow, pull up that "missing kids" list.
- Got it.
I'll see you then.
- Bye.
- See ya.
Wanna come over for dinner?
Mom's making her famous "call to the Chinese place".
Xander, do you guys even have a stove?
So I'll look into ways that you can de-cloak an invisible someone.
What about you?
Cordelia might be working on her dress tonight.
Maybe there'll be some action.
I guess I'm gonna start the hunt.
How exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can't see?
You may have to listen to people.
- Very funny!
- I thought so.
Should I wear my hair up?
Should I wear it up?
How does the hem go?
Is it long enough or Isn't that beautiful?
Who's there?
A vampire casts no reflection.
Don't worry.
I'm not here to eat.
- Buffy said you no longer feed from humans.
- Not for a long while.
Is that why you're here?
To see her?
I can't.
It's too hard for me to be around her.
A vampire in love with a slayer?
It's rather poetic, in a maudlin sort of way.
What can l, uh What can I do for you?
I know you've been researching the Master.
Yes, the vampire king.
I try to learn as much as I can about him for the day Buffy must face him.
Something's already in motion.
Something big, but I don't know what.
You've read all the slayer lore, right?
I've studied all the extant volumes, of course.
But the most salient books of slayer prophecy have been lost.
The Tiberius Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex.
Codex?
It's reputed to have contained the most complete prophecies about the slayer's role.
Unfortunately the book was lost in the 15th century.
Not lost.
Misplaced.
I can get it.
That would be most helpful.
My own volumes have been rather useless of late.
"Legends Of Vishnu"?
There's an invisible girl terrorising the school.
That's not really my area of expertise.
Nor mine, I'm afraid.
It's fascinating, though.
By all accounts, it's a wonderful power to possess.
Oh, I don't know.
Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there.
It's an overrated pleasure.
God, I am never sitting through another one of those alumni lectures again.
Two hours of "My Trek Through Nepal".
Hello?
There is nobody caring.
And did you see his toupee?
It was like a cabbage.
And those slides?
"That's a mountain.
That's a mountain, too".
"Now look at some mountains".
I swear he had three slides and just used them over and over.
I know, but did you see his toupee?
It was like the worst.
We're talking, OK?
Oh, and did you guys check out that extreme toupee?
Yeah, that's realistic!
It looked like a cabbage.
That's so funny.
The winner is Cordelia Chase!
Let's bring up our new May Queen.
Cordelia.
Thank you for making the right choice and for showing me how much you all love me.
Being this popular is notjust my right, but my responsibility.
And I want you to know I take it very seriously.
It all began So, Giles said you'd be here.
Why are you being here?
Last night was a bust, but I still think Cordie's the key.
This is the "dead and missing" list.
I pulled up their classes, activities, medical records.
Good work.
Has Cordelia hired a bodyguard or something?
Check out this one.
It's the most recent.
Marcie Ross disappeared six months ago.
- I don't know her.
- Me neither.
Her only activity was Band.
She played the flute.
So?
Last night when I was hunting, I heard this flute.
And it was in the Band Room that I lost Miss Invisible.
This tracks.
I'm gonna check it out.
- See you guys later?
- OK, we'll see you after Geometry.
Marcie Ross.
So, it is you.
Cordelia, could you possibly be on time?
Who's there?
Ms Miller?
Oh, my God!
Ms Miller!
Oh, my God!
Are you OK?
Ms Miller?
Ah!
What happened?
Attacked Didn't see.
A nest?
Looked like she'd been there for months.
It's where I found this.
- Check it out.
- Oh, my God.
"Have a nice summer".
"Have a nice summer".
This girl had no friends at all.
Uh, once again, I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap.
- It's what you write if you've nothing to say.
- It's the kiss of death.
You didn't know Marcie Ross?
Never met her.
Why?
Cos you both wrote it, too.
"Have a nice" Yeesh!
Where am I?
Oh.
"Have a great summer".
- See, I cared.
- You guys don't remember her?
No, I probably didn't see her except to sign the book.
I mean, this is a big school.
Xander, we each had four classes with her last year.
No one noticed her and now she's invisible.
She turned invisible because no one noticed her?
Of course!
I've been investigating the mystical causes of invisibility, but not the quantum-mechanical.
Physics.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say "Huh"?
It's a rudimentary concept that reality is shaped, even even created, by our perception.
And with the Hellmouth and its mystical energy People perceived Marcie as invisible, and she became so.
So, who knows the answer to this one?
Think about it.
Cordelia?
Just because this story's about him doesn't mean he's the hero.
Right?
Exactly.
So what do we call him?
- Willow?
- Well, the protagonist.
- Xander?
- Why can't he be both?
He did heroic things.
Absolutely.
Who doesn't agree?
OK.
And how about you?
This isn't this great power that she can control, but something that was done to her.
- That we did to her.
- No wonder she's miffed.
What does she want?
Just what we thought.
- Cordelia.
- What?
I knew you'd be here.
Buffy, I know we've had our differences, with you being so weird and all and hanging out with these total losers.
Ooh!
Anyway, despite that, I know you share this feeling that we have for each other - ..
deep down.
- Nausea?
Somebody is after me!
They've just tried to kill Ms Miller.
She was helping me with my homework.
And Mitch and Harmony!
This is all about me.
Me, me, me!
Wow!
For once she's right.
So, you've come to me for help?
Because you're always around when weird stuff is happening.
And I know you're very strong and you've got all those weapons.
I was kind of hoping you were in a gang.
Please!
I don't have anyone else to turn to.
Please.
- Sit down.
- OK, thanks.
You know, I I don't recall ever seeing you here before.
Oh, no.
I have a life.
OK.
Cordelia, your attacker is an invisible girl.
Who is really angry at you, which I can't imagine personally, but it takes all kinds, you know.
I don't care what it is.
Just get rid of it.
Well, it's not that simple.
It's a person.
It's this person.
- Do you have any idea why she'd be so - God.
Is she really wearing Laura Ashley?
So homicidal?
I have no idea.
I've never seen this girl before in my life.
I guess you didn't see me coming.
Cordelia, you don't remember me.
I remember you and your slut friends.
I hate them!
They take your life and suck it out of you!
But they didn't see me coming.
No.
They gotta learn.
From what you told us about the attack on Ms Miller, we now have two messages from Marcie.
"Look" and "Listen".
Messages we don't understand.
I don't think we're supposed to yet.
Marcie's not quite ready.
But, from what she did to this picture, she's wigged on the May Queen thing.
She may do something about it.
Stop the coronation tonight maybe.
Keep you guys away from the Bronze?
Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight!
Can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?
If I'm not crowned tonight, then Marcie's won.
And that would be bad.
She's evil, OK?
Way eviler than me.
- Cordelia has a point.
- Buffy's with me on this.
Anyway, continuing the May Queen activities may be the best way to draw Marcie out.
- We can use Cordelia as bait.
- Great!
Bait?
Willow and Xander, you'll help me begin our research anew.
Unless we cure Marcie's invisibility, - then Buffy will be - A sitting duck.
- Come on.
- Well, I have to try on my dress.
Am I really bait?
So, how creepy is it that this Marcie's been at this for months, spying on us?
Learning our most guarded secrets.
So are you saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?
- That about sums it up.
- Bummer for her.
- It's awful to feel that Ionely.
- You've read something about the feeling?
Hey, you think I'm never Ionely because I'm so cute and popular?
I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone.
It's not like any of them really know me.
I don't even know if they like me half the time.
People just want to be in the popular zone.
Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.
Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?
It beats being alone all by yourself.
Listen.
Come on.
We could talk to her, perhaps reason with her.
- Or possibly grab her.
- There are three of us.
Let's go.
If you ever tell anyone that I changed in a mop closet Your secret dies with me.
It looks OK.
But hurry.
OK.
Over here.
Marcie, we know what happened to you.
Please, can we talk to you?
We're sorry we ignored you.
Can you say "gulp"?
What's that sound?
You know what you were saying before?
I understand.
Somehow it doesn't seem to matter how popular you are, when You were popular?
In what alternate universe?
In LA.
The point is I did sort of feel like something was missing.
Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
OK.
Can we have the heartfelt talk with a little less talk from you?
Cordelia?
Cordelia!
Cordelia!
Buffy!
It's gas.
And she's snuffed out the pilot light.
The gas is up full.
I can't find the shut-off valve.
- Is this it?
- OK, that's bad.
How about the door?
No!
One spark and you'll take the whole building with us.
Cordelia?
Cordelia?
Oh, my God!
Buffy?
You're awake?
Yeah.
I can't feel my face!
- What do you mean?
- My face is numb.
What is she doing?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
That should give us a few minutes, but if we don't get out soon - Why is Marcie doing this?
- The Ioneliness, the constant exile.
She's She has gone mad.
You think?
!
I'm disappointed.
I really hoped you guys had figured it out by now.
Why don't you explain it?
Come on, Marcie, what are we supposed to learn?
Yeah, what do you want to teach us?
You don't get it.
You're not the student.
You're the lesson.
- What did you do to my face?
- Your face.
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
Your beautiful face.
It's what makes you shine just a little bit brighter than the rest of us.
We all want what you have.
To be noticed, remembered.
To be seen.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm fulfilling your fondest wish.
I'm gonna give you a face no one will ever forget.
One, two, three.
Try again.
- Marcie, you can't do this.
- What are you gonna do?
Slay me?
Marcie, you know this is wrong.
You should have stayed out of my way!
You know, I thought you would understand my vision, but you're just like them.
Please don't do this.
No!
You should be grateful.
People who pass you will remember you for the rest of their lives.
Children will dream about you.
And all your friends who come to the coronation tonight will take the sight of the May Queen to their graves.
- Wait!
- No, we really have to get started.
The anaesthetic will wear off.
I don't want you to faint.
It's less fun if you're not awake.
You guys, I I'm blackin' out on you Let me see.
I think we should start with your smile.
I think it should be wider.
Marcie, I know you think I don't understand, but I do.
Yeah, I'll bet you know how I feel.
I'm sure you can be with your friends and feel alone cos they don't really know you.
You're just a spoiled brat, and you think you can charm your way out of this.
Isn't that what you think?
I see right through you.
Oh, my God!
Get me out of here, please.
Just hold still.
Oh, my God.
Come on!
- What happened?
- You tell me.
I'm up, Mom.
Hi.
What do you want?
I brought you the Codex.
- I came in and smelled the gas.
- We must shut it off or the school will go up.
I'll get it.
It's not like I need the oxygen.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You know, I really felt sorry for you.
You've suffered.
But there's one thing I really didn't factor into all this - you're a thundering loony.
Buffy, are you OK?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Buffy!
Buffy?
Oh, my God!
Hey, moron.
I'm invisible.
- How can you fight someone you can't see?
- Oh, my God.
Cordelia, shut up.
OK.
I see you.
Everybody, stay where you are.
FBI.
Nobody move!
- OK, we'll take it from here now, ma'am.
- Take what from where?
Agents Doyle and Manetti.
We're here for her.
- Where were you when she played surgeon?
- I'm sorry, we came as fast as we could.
- Oh, my God.
- We'll take it from here.
You can cure her?
We can rehabilitate her.
In time she'll learn to be a useful member of society again.
- Where are we going?
- Very useful.
This isn't the first time this has happened.
This happened at other schools.
- We're not at liberty to discuss that.
- It would be best if you forgot this incident.
Do you know that you guys are very creepy?
Thank you for your help.
Oh, and ..
have a nice day.
Can I get untied now?
Thanks.
I just can't believe how twisted Marcie got.
By the way, how did you guys escape?
- When the gas was comin' down - Ajanitor found us and shut the valve off.
- We were lucky.
- I'll say!
Hi.
Hey.
Look, um, I didn't get a chance to say anything yesterday, with the coronation.
But, um, I guess I just wanted to say thank you, all of you.
That's funny cos she looks like Cordelia.
You really helped me out yesterday and you didn't have to.
- So thank you.
- It's OK.
We were gonna grab lunch, if you wanted to Whoa, you're not hanging with these losers, are you?
Are you kidding?
I was just being charitable, helping them with their fashion problems.
You think I really felt like joining that social leper colony?
Please!
Boy, where's an invisible girl when you really need one?
- I think you'll be happy here.
- You should fit right in.
- Welcome, Marcie.
- Hey.
- Class, this is Marcie.
- Hi, Marcie.
Sit down.
OK, class, let's get started.
Everybody turn to page 54 of your texts.
Cool!
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".
I've been trapped here so long, I've forgotten what it's like on the surface.
- Who's that?
- That must be Angel.
A vampire in love with the Slayer.
It's rather poetic.
"And in this time shall come the Anointed".
"And in this time shall come the Anointed".
"And the Slayer will not know him and he will lead her into Hell".
- The Pergamum Codex.
- Codex?
It contained the most complete prophecies about the Slayer.
I can get it.
You know how I feel about you.
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?
There's never been anyone else for me but you.
And we're good friends and it's time to take the next step.
Would you date me?
Oh, that's good: "Date me".
It's terrible, right?
Oh, no.
Well, yes.
"Date me" is silly.
What I should do is just start with talking about the dance.
You know, Buffy, Spring Fling just isn't any dance.
It's a time for students to choose a mate, and then we can observe their mating rituals and tag them before they migrate.
- Just kill me!
- You're doing fine.
Why is it so hard?
I should just say "I like you.
Let's go to the dance".
- Direct and to the point.
- I'm ready.
I wanna do it now.
I gotta do it now.
Buffy's not here.
You can practise on me some more.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
I'll think about it too much.
Why didn't Buffy show up tonight?
- What's she doing?
- You know.
The usual.
- What was that?
- What was what?
Someone's out there.
That's silly.
Who would be out there?
Three in one night.
Giles would be so proud.
"The Master shall rise".
Yes, this is it!
"The Master shall rise and the Slayer" My God!
The stairs.
Under the stairs!
Yes!
Yes!
Shake, Earth!
This is a sign!
We are in the final days!
My time is come!
Glory!
Glory!
What do you think?
Five point one?
Morning.
Wow.
The damage looks fairly structural.
Are we safe in here?
Buffy!
What?
Do I have something on my face?
No and yes, we're safe.
Probably best not to go up there.
How're you doin', Giles?
Get much sleep last night?
I've been working.
Me too.
I went hunting last night and it is awfully sweet of you to ask.
It's getting hairy out there, Giles.
I killed three vampires last night.
One was practically on school grounds.
- They're increasing.
- And getting cockier.
I'm not loving it.
Last night was a pretty close call.
Yes.
Giles, care?
I'm putting my life on the line, battling the undead.
I broke a nail, OK?
I'm wearing a press-on.
The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest.
You could go "Hm".
Oh, sorry I'm very glad that you're all right.
I need to verify - I just can't really talk right now.
- Fine.
That's OK.
I can't put it off any longer.
- I have to meet my terrible fate.
- What?
Biology.
- Wow, that was boring.
- I don't feel that "boring" covers it.
No.
"Boring" falls short.
Even I was bored.
And I'm a science nerd.
- Don't say that.
- I'm not ashamed.
It's the computer age.
Nerds are in.
- They're still in, right?
- Willow, don't you have a thing?
A thing?
The thing that I have which is a thing that I have to go to!
See you later.
- What on earth is her deal?
- She's Willow.
So Buffy, I wanted to There's this thing I wanted to ask you, to talk to you about.
- OK.
What's up?
- Let's go over here and sit.
- Now you're making me nervous.
- There's no need to be nervous.
It's silly.
Hey!
Leave.
Thanks.
Well?
You know, Spring Fling is a time for students to gather and Oh, God.
I want you to go to the dance with me.
You and me, on a date.
I don't know what to say.
Well, you're not laughing, so that's a good start.
Buffy, I like you a lot.
And I know we're friends and we've had experiences.
We've fought some bloodsucking fiends, and that's all been a good time.
But I want more.
I wanna dance with you.
Xander, you're one of my best friends.
You and Willow.
Willow's not looking to date you.
Or if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.
- I don't wanna spoil our friendship.
- I don't wanna spoil it either.
But that's not the point, is it?
You either feel a thing, or you don't.
I don't.
Xander, I'm sorry.
I just don't think of you that way.
Well, try.
I'll wait.
- Xander - No.
Forget it.
I'm not him.
I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
That's really harsh.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't handle rejection well.
Funny considering all the practice I've had, huh?
Xander, I'm sorry.
I never You know what?
Let's just not.
Hello.
This is Giles.
Rupert Giles.
I need to see you.
No.
I realise that.
Come after sundown.
Good.
I'll see you then.
That outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday - only wrinklier.
Were you here all night?
Sorry, I'm not really up to socialising just now.
Something's going on, Rupert.
I'm guessing you know what it is.
What do you know?
I have been surfing the Net looking for unexplained incidents.
People are always sending stuff my way.
They know the occult's my turf.
Here is the latest.
"A cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes".
"A family was swimming in Whisper Lake when the lake began to boil".
And "Mercy Hospital last night, a boy was born with his eyes facing inward".
I'm not stupid.
This is apocalypse stuff.
Throw in the earthquake and I'd say we've got a problem.
- I would say the end is nigh.
- I don't know if I can trust you.
I helped cast that demon from the Internet.
That merits trust.
Look, I'm scared, OK?
Plus I've got this crazy monk e-mailing me from Cortona about some Anointed One.
The Anointed One?
He's dead.
- Someone's dead?
- Who is this monk?
Brother Luca something.
Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
- Talk to him.
Find out everything he knows.
- You haven't told me jack, so why the order?
Just do it!
I'll explain later.
You'd better.
I'll get everything tonight.
The guys'll help.
It's all in the AV room.
The sound system and decorations.
- Aura needs help moving the coolers.
- Don't sweat it!
Bring everything to the Bronze and I'll meet you there in the morning.
- Done.
- You're so sweet.
- Why are you so sweet?
- I don't know.
I'm usually mean as a snake.
Willow!
I'll see you in the morning.
- I really like your outfit!
- No, you don't.
- No, I really don't.
But I need a favour.
- What kind?
The Bronze won't let us use their sound system.
You know how to hook one up.
If you could show up tomorrow morning, I'd be really grateful.
I mean, I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
- Sure.
- Great.
Tomorrow at ten?
Sure.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How'd it go?
- On a scale of one to ten?
It sucked.
Well, I guess it could be worse.
I could have gangrene on my face.
- What did she say?
- Apart from "no", does it really matter?
She's still jonesing for Angel.
Couldn't care less about me.
- At least now you know.
- Yeah, the deal's done.
The polls are in and it's time for my concession speech.
I know what we'll do.
We can go.
Be my date.
We'll have a great time.
We'll dance, we'll go wild.
What do you say?
- No.
- Good.
- What?
- There's no way.
Come on.
You think I wanna go to the dance with you and watch you wish you were with her?
Do you think that's my idea of high jinks?
You should know better.
- I didn't think.
- I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
I'll see you on Monday.
That's OK.
I don't wanna go.
I'm just gonna go home, lie down, and listen to country music.
The music of pain.
Giles, you are not gonna believe this.
It's clear.
It's what's gonna happen.
It's happening now.
Angel?
You've gotta be wrong.
- I've checked all my volumes.
It's real.
- There's gotta be some way round it.
Some prophecies are a bit dodgy.
They're mutable.
Buffy has thwarted them time and time again.
But the Codex has nothing in it that does not come to pass.
- Then you're reading it wrong.
- I wish to God I were!
But it's very plain.
Tomorrow night, Buffy will face the Master and she will die.
Well, have you verified the text?
So that's it, huh?
I remember the drill.
One Slayer dies, the next one's called.
I wonder who she is.
Will you train her?
Or will they send someone else?
- Buffy - Does it say how he's gonna kill me?
Do you think it'll hurt?
Don't touch me!
Were you even gonna tell me?
I was hoping that I wouldn't have to, that there was some way around it.
I've got a way around it.
I quit.
- It's not that simple.
- I'm making it that simple.
I quit!
I resign!
I'm fired!
Find someone else to stop the Master from taking over.
I'm not sure that anyone else can.
All the signs indicate Signs?
Read me the signs!
Tell me my fortune!
You're so useful, sitting here with all your books!
You're really a lot of help!
No, I don't suppose I am.
- I know this is hard.
- What do you know about this?
You're never gonna die.
Do you think I want anything to happen to you?
We just gotta figure out a way I already did.
I quit, remember?
Pay attention!
Buffy, if the Master rises I don't care!
I don't care.
Giles, I'm 16 years old.
I don't wanna die.
Hi, honey.
You all right?
Sure.
You're probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had.
Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
- Mom, let's go away!
- What?
- Anywhere.
Just for a while.
A weekend.
- Honey!
A mother-daughter thing.
We can talk about the embarrassing things you love to bring up.
- You know the gallery's open on weekends.
- Mom, please.
Isn't the prom tomorrow night?
Or Spring Fling, whatever they're calling it?
- I guess.
- Nobody asked you?
- Someone.
- But not the right someone.
See, sometimes I do know what you're thinking.
Well, then This probably isn't the best time for this but ..
I saw you eyeing it at the store.
I figured Mom, we can't afford this.
The way you've been eating, we can afford it.
It's beautiful.
I think you should wear it to the dance.
No.
I can't go to the dance.
Says who?
Is it written somewhere?
You should do what you want.
Homecoming, my freshman year of college.
I didn't have a date, so I got dressed up and I went anyway.
- Was it awful?
- It was awful.
For about an hour.
- Then what happened?
- I met your father.
He didn't have a date either?
He did.
That's a much funnier story that you will not get to hear.
Oh, but it was a beautiful night.
And you had your whole life ahead of you.
Must be nice.
Kevin said he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night.
He promised!
We'll never get everything ready in time!
He probably forgot.
It's not that big a deal.
You don't understand!
I'm not mad.
He totally flaked on me.
On me!
And I don't even care.
God help me, I think it's cute.
There they are!
They're watching cartoons.
That's so cu That's not cute.
That's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
Right.
I'm furious.
- Men!
I don't know why we put up with them.
- I hear ya.
Obviously, Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
Oh, my God!
Kevin!
Kevin!
Buffy!
There's something on the news.
Willow.
I've seen so much.
I thought I could take anything.
But, Buffy This This was different.
It'll be all right.
I'm trying to think how to say it, to explain it so you understand.
It doesn't matter as long as you're OK.
I'm not OK.
I knew those guys.
I go to that room every day.
And when I walked in there, it wasn't our world any more.
They made it theirs.
And they had fun.
- What are we gonna do?
- What we have to.
Promise me you'll stay in tonight, OK?
Buffy.
I like your dress.
Take care.
Soon!
Soon!
OK.
So this Master guy tried to open the Hellmouth, but he got stuck in it.
Now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out, which opens the Hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.
Yes.
That about sums it up, yes.
The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer.
- She's so little.
- Did you get in touch with this Brother Luca?
As far as I can tell, no one can.
He's disappeared.
Did send out one last global, though.
- A short one.
- What did it say?
Isaiah 11:6.
Which I dutifully looked up.
"The wolf shall live with the lamb.
The leopard shall lie down with the kid".
"The calf, the lion and the fatling together, and the little child shall lead them".
- It's warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
- It all depends where he's leading them to.
Aurelius wrote of the Anointed One, "The Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell".
So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid.
If the vampire that Buffy killed is in fact not the Anointed, then it may well be.
- Well, then we need to warn her.
- I don't intend involving her at all.
What do you mean?
Buffy's not going to face the Master.
I am.
No, you're not.
So I'm looking for a kid, huh?
And he'll lead me to the Master?
I'm not going to send you out there to die.
I've waded about in these books for so long, I've forgotten what the real world is like.
It's time I found out.
- You're not facing the Master.
- I've made up my mind.
- So have I. - I made up mine first.
I'm older and wiser than you and Just do what you're told for once!
All right?
That's not how it goes.
I'm the Slayer.
I don't care what the books say.
I defy prophecy and I'm going.
Nothing you can say will change my mind.
I know.
When he wakes up, tell him I dunno.
Think of something cool.
Tell him I said it.
You fight the Master and you'll die.
Maybe.
Maybe I'll take him with me.
Help me.
It's OK.
I know who you are.
- She what?
- I told you something was going on with her.
She knew about this prophecy of yours?
- Oh, man.
What do we do?
- We stay calm.
First thing.
- Calm?
- I think he's right.
Calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here, but I'm staying freaked out!
- Xander - How could you let her go?
As my soon-to-be purple jaw will attest, I did not "let her go".
- How can we help her?
- Sorry to bring this up, - but we also have an apocalypse.
- Do you mind?
How come she's in the club?
Once the Master gets free, the Hellmouth opens and everybody dies.
I don't care.
I'm sorry.
I don't.
- Right now, I gotta help Buffy.
- We don't even know where she's gone.
No.
But I can find out.
Well, look who's here.
Mind if I come in?
- Make yourself at home.
- She's gone.
- What?
- Buffy's gone to fight the Master.
- He'll kill her.
- Rumour has it.
Only we're not gonna let it happen.
What do you propose we do about it?
Look, I know you can find this Master guy.
He's underground, right?
Take me to him.
You're way out of your league, kid.
The Master'll kill you before you can even breathe, if you're lucky.
How can I say this clearly?
I don't like you.
At the end of the day, I pretty much think you're a vampire.
But Buffy's got this big old yen for you.
She thinks you're a real person.
And right now, I need you to prove her right.
You're in love with her.
Aren't you?
The Master is as old as any vampire on record.
We don't know how powerful he'll be if he reaches the surface.
OK.
Here's my question.
The Hellmouth opens.
Yes.
Where?
If he's underground and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?
Good point.
Look, you have a look through the "Black Chronicles".
Willow.
Could you check the local histories for any common denominators?
Locations of incidents and such.
Right.
OK.
Welcome.
Thanks for having me.
You should talk to your contractor.
- Looks like you got some water damage.
- Oh, good.
The "feeble banter" portion of the fight.
Why don't we just cut to the Nice shot.
This way.
What?
- You're looking at my neck.
- What?
- You checked out my neck.
- No.
Keep your distance.
- I wasn't looking at your neck!
- I told you to eat before we left.
You're not going to kill me with that thing.
- Don't be so sure.
- You still don't understand your part in this?
You are not the hunter.
You are the lamb.
Now let's think about this.
The vampires have been gathering.
They know he's coming.
They will be his army.
- They'll be at the Hellmouth?
- The Master last tried to rise at the Harvest.
He sent some vampires to get him fresh blood.
- Where did that go down?
- The Bronze.
- The prom!
- We have to warn them.
No, we'll go.
You have to concentrate on demon killing.
- My car's in the lot.
- Stay close together.
And be careful.
We will.
For someone who's all-powerful, you sure do like to hide.
I'm waiting for you.
I want this moment to last.
Well, I don't.
I understand.
What if they get to the Bronze before we do?
- We don't need to worry about that.
- Why not?
Cos they're not going to the Bronze.
You tried.
It was noble of you.
You heard the prophecy that I was about to break free and you came to stop me.
But prophecies are tricky creatures.
They don't tell you everything.
You're the one that sets me free.
If you hadn't come, I couldn't go.
Think about that.
Oh, God!
The power!
By the way, I like your dress.
- What was that?
- It's too late.
He's gone up.
She's dead.
- No.
She's not dead.
- She's not breathing.
But if she drowned, there's a shot.
CPR.
You have to do it.
I have no breath.
Come on.
Come on!
- Why are they coming here?
- Not caring.
Get in!
Come on.
Breathe.
Breathe!
Come on.
Buffy?
Buffy?
Xander?
Welcome back.
I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park and suddenly these things came at me!
- What do we do now?
- We've gotta get to the library.
Great.
Of course, we generally walk there.
What the?
- What's happening?
- Guess!
Why are they coming here?
My world.
My beautiful world!
Easy.
Easy.
- The Master?
- He's gone up.
No.
You're still weak.
No.
No, I feel strong.
I feel different.
Let's go.
They're coming in through the stacks.
The bookshelves!
My office.
Somebody help!
How do you know where the Master's going?
I know.
Oh, look.
A bad guy.
You two wait here.
Keep the other vampires off me.
- Angel, better put on your game face.
- I'm ready.
One way or another, this won't take long.
See how you like it!
This won't keep 'em out for long!
Giles!
The Hellmouth.
Yes!
Come forth, my child.
Come into my world.
I don't think it's yours just yet.
You're dead.
I may be dead, but I'm still pretty.
Which is more than I can say for you.
You were destined to die.
It was written.
What can I say?
I flunked the written.
Come here.
Giles!
Did you really think you could best me here when you couldn't below?
- You have fruit-punch mouth.
- What?
Save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
Where are yourjibes now?
- Will you laugh when my Hell is on Earth?
- You're that amped about Hell, go there.
- The vampires?
- Gone.
- The Master?
- Dead.
The Hellmouth is closed.
Buffy?
Buffy?
Oh, sorry.
- It's just been a really weird day.
- Yeah.
Buffy died and everything.
- Wow.
Harsh.
- I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
- Well, what do we do now?
- I'd like to get out of this place.
I don't like the library much now.
Hey, I hear there's a dance at the Bronze.
Could be fun.
- Buffy?
- Sure.
We saved the world.
I say we party.
I mean I got all pretty.
What about him?
He's not going anywhere.
Loser.
- I'm not dancing, though.
- We'll see.
So what's the story with the car?
I'm really, really hungry.
- By the way, I really like your dress.
- Yeah, yeah.
A big hit with everyone.
