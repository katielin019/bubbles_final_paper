{START OF EPISODE 1}
Before we begin, I'd like to say how honoured I am to be taking over this spot.
Obviously, I have some rather big shoes to fill.
My predecessor here was much beloved.
But I have never been one to shrink from a challenge.
And I'm sure that we'll all enjoy many happy years here together in my new home.
Now, today on Medical Minute, we're going to be tackling the sticky subject of Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Great audition.
Really?
That's all you need?
I think we have a good idea what you're all about.
Excellent.
- We'll be in touch.
- I'm sure you will.
Next, please.
Oh, formalities.
Yes, I understand.
Perhaps I'll just take a walk around the station, check out the dressing rooms, introduce myself to a few people.
Say, you know, is there a sign-up list for the softball team?
I'm sure that Frasier "Slugger" Crane's gonna be an asset to this station in more ways than one.
Morning, Frasier.
Oh, good morning, Dad.
- Little early for the piano, isn't it?
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
I woke up this morning thinking about that operetta I've been writing.
You know, the one about Robert and Elizabeth Browning.
And I think Well, I just had to get right to it.
Well, that's what I get for living in a big city.
If it's not the horns waking you up, it's someone writing an operetta about the Brownings.
Well, I'm pretty sure that I've solved the problem.
- Good for you.
- But I'd have to hear it to be sure.
- I'll bet.
- Dad?
- Forget it.
- Come on.
- No, I've done it once, that's enough.
- Come on, it'll just take a minute.
- I just want to do this one section.
- Oh, all right.
But I'm not doing the accent.
That's fine.
All right, we'll take it from right here.
- Fine.
- All right.
What is it that you feel?
- Love - Love That fear makes you conceal - Love - Love The power's there to heal - Love - Love Reveal!
- Take me in your arms - I'm not doing this.
- All right, I'll sing it with Niles later.
- Oh, that'll cheer me up.
Dad, be careful of those sketches there.
Sketches?
Yes, I've been planning on redecorating the apartment.
I thought why not just design my own furniture?
Boy, Frasier, you know, you've been taking on a lot of big projects lately.
Well, Dad, you see, any moment that phone is going to ring with another job offer, and this blessed little hiatus will be over.
I want to have achieved as many of my life's ambitions as possible.
Gee, Dad, frankly, you should take up a project or two.
Me?
What are you talking about?
I'm doing stuff all the time.
Why just this weekend, I taught Eddie a great new trick.
- Really?
- Come here, boy.
Yeah, I'll show you.
It starts out: I point a gun at him.
I like it so far.
Then I say, "Freeze, punk, it's all over".
It's all over.
Oh, come on, Eddie, you're supposed to go like this.
Well done, Dad.
Now you just have to teach Eddie to say, "It's all over".
- Can someone help me here?
- What is all that?
Books Dr. Crane sent me to get from the storage space.
It's research I'm doing for a novel I'm planning.
Daphne, I was beginning to wonder what was taking you so long.
Well, forgive me, but I did have to move three crates, a rowing machine and a cast-iron bathtub out of the way first.
Oh, look at that, the only book I really wanted was in the shelf already.
Here, Daphne, you'll have to take these back down.
Oh, my God, that's my duck!
All right.
Thank you, Daphne.
When you're done, I need you to run some errands for me.
I need a very sturdy lemon zester, some more music paper, some potting soil and an easel.
Oh, be happy to.
Then after that, maybe I could draw a bath, strip you naked and scrub you with a loofah.
- Would that be all right, Dr. Crane?
- Yes.
I didn't even see you standing there.
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah, just a second, Dad.
Okay.
Well, it's about Frasier.
Ever since he got fired, he's been so weird.
All these projects he's got going.
Yeah, don't worry, it's normal.
He's simply in a state of denial.
- Denial about what?
- About getting fired.
People like Frasier's whole identity revolves around their job.
The loss of the job is like a Like a death.
They cope with it the same way they would with a death, by going through a series of stages.
The first one's denial.
Usually, that's followed by anger, then I've done it!
Escoffier's most difficult dish, done to tangy perfection.
You know, sometimes I think I may have missed my calling not becoming a gourmet chef.
- I see we're still in stage one.
- Hello, Niles.
Hey, Frasier, you ready for our squash date?
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to cancel.
I'll be cooking all morning.
- What for?
- Actually, I'm holding a little picnic for the KACL employees and their families.
As you may recall, I did get them all fired.
Oh, yes.
So I was just hoping to make amends by serving up a little Duck a I'Orange and an alfresco mea culpa.
You know, people like chips at a picnic too.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, Bebe.
Yes.
Yes, the television job.
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, what a relief.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
- You got it?
- No, thank goodness.
That job starts tomorrow.
I have got things to do.
Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier.
Sorry?
My God, you sound just like Dad.
I am going to get another job.
The people of this city need me.
I'm a beloved Seattle institution.
Couple of more days like this, he's gonna be in a beloved Seattle institution.
Hey, doc.
Roz.
Wait till you hear this.
- I got a job today.
- Really?
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
- You ought to rub me for good luck.
- Where?
Well, start on my knee.
Work your way up.
Where's the job?
Oh, it's that new all-sports station.
I got the breakfast slot.
I even came up with a slogan: "Coffee, eggs and Bulldog".
Sounds like some sort of a Malaysian Happy Meal.
A word of caution on the hummus: To be avoided, as a leper would avoid a Magic Teacup ride.
Gil, Frasier made that.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's quite all right.
I understand.
You need to flex your critical muscles while you're between jobs.
Oh, good.
Then you might enjoy this one: After sampling your unnuanced baba ganoush, I was tempted to describe your entire Middle Eastern buffet as "The Sorrow and the Pita".
Oh, who's got a pencil?
I've got to write that one down.
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh, Tooty.
- Hey.
- I got the most exciting news today.
They just picked up my Storytime Theatre on public television.
- Hey, all right.
- That's wonderful.
Talk about living happily ever after, huh?
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Oh, well, Kenny.
Great party.
Oh, by the way, I picked something up for you on my way to work today.
- Work?
- Yeah, yeah.
They took me back at my old job: Anyway, I was passing the bus stop and Excuse me a second.
Anyway, they were about to paper over your poster, so I peeled it off for you.
Well, that is quite a keepsake.
Don't mention it.
By the way, the poster under yours was an old radio guy, Dr. Earl?
Who was he again?
You know, I'm sorry, I don't recall.
Yeah, I'm the same way.
Once they're off the air, who remembers?
Do you realise we're the only people here - without a job?
- Roz If we don't get this Talk 100 spot, there may not be any left.
Roz, I've told you we have nothing to worry about.
Now, come on.
Everyone?
If I could have your attention, please.
We, of course, have planned some activities for today's little get-together.
And I'd like to start with one for the children.
Now, what we have here is an authentic Mexican piñata.
The object is to take the stick and give it a little whack Bravo for me.
I just got the Talk 100 job.
Oh, well, good for you, Gil.
Yes, you're gonna wanna give this little fellow a good crack.
Otherwise You know, maybe I better get this started for you.
Otherwise, the candy will never come out.
And everybody knows keeping something locked up inside is never good for anyone, is it?
Hello?
Yes, Bebe.
We did hear the news.
And how thrilling for Gil.
Could you hold, please?
What is this I feel?
Love That fear makes me conceal Love Dad?
Was I doing it again?
Was I doing it before Mrs. Walsh got off?
That's why Mrs. Walsh got off.
- So how's Frasier doing?
- Oh, he's getting weirder.
He beat up a piñata yesterday.
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
Not like this.
They found a jawbreaker on the other side of the highway.
Oh, well, this is good.
It means he's reached the anger stage.
In due course, he'll go through bargaining, - depression and finally acceptance.
- What's bargaining?
It's like when a person makes a deal with God to spare their life.
Oh, yeah, I know all about that.
I remember right after I got shot, I said: "God, if I promise never to drink another bottle of Ballantine's, will you let me get through this"?
- Dad, you still drink Ballantine's.
- Not in bottles, baby.
You're just in time.
I'm throwing a party for my fan club.
Here?
Is there some problem with the bridge they normally meet under?
Very amusing, Niles.
You see, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and last night, I did something I haven't done since I was a very little boy.
I got down on my knees at my bedside, and I prayed for guidance.
And I asked God: "What can I do to get my old life back"?
And the answer came: "Take better care of your fans".
- God told you that?
- Yes.
I have taken my public for granted.
I take weeks before I answer my fan mail, if I answer it at all.
I've been a bad celebrity.
- But no more.
- I didn't even know you had a fan club.
Well, actually, they meet on the Internet, and I visited their website yesterday for the first time.
Bad celebrity.
But I invited them all here, and you know what?
They were so grateful that before long, I mean, God, suddenly they were proposing that they hold a massive rally in my honour demanding that I return to the airwaves.
You know, I think it's safe to say that someone is already working in mysterious ways.
Someone sure as hell is.
Some of the crab puffs, Dr. Crane?
No, no, thank you.
Just keep those away from me.
Won't be long before I'm back in the public eye, and I've got to remain fighting trim.
- Oh, Daphne.
- What you got there?
Just a box of Dr. Crane's publicity photos from the storage cubby.
- Thank you.
- This flashlight sure came in handy.
Helped me to find that box way up on the top of that old bookcase.
And when that thing flew in my hair, I had something to beat it to death with.
Oh, good Lord, our first arrivals.
God, I've got to check the food.
Daphne, will you run to the store for me?
I need felt tip pens to sign these pictures with, do you mind?
Sure.
What else have I got to do?
Hi, Daphne.
It's Daphne.
Hello.
Have we met?
- We know you from the magazine.
- April '96, Seattle Monthly.
"At Home With Dr. Frasier Crane".
You wore an orange-flowered dress.
And your hair was different then.
Oh, how creepy.
Do come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Wow, hi.
- Hello.
- Doris Buckley.
- Doris.
- Aaron Fitch.
Aaron.
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.
You know, perhaps I should introduce these people to you.
We know who they are.
And now where we live.
Oh, don't be shy.
- Come in, come in.
- This is great.
This is great.
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is great.
This is great.
It's cool, isn't it?
Your brother having his own club.
Yeah, well, seeing all of you, I sort of wish I had a club myself.
You know, perhaps you'd like to fill out these nametags.
- We'll wait for everyone else to come.
- Who else is coming?
- Well, the rest of the fan club.
- This is the fan club, the three of us.
Well, I'll be off to get those pens now.
You know, perhaps you should all help yourself to some food.
Niles, may I have a word with you, please?
Niles!
I can't let them hold that rally.
Three kooks marching in a circle.
- Do you know what that will do?
- Make them very dizzy very fast.
Make me a laughingstock.
I'll never work in this town again.
I've got to stop them.
Sorry to interrupt, but I need to carve the second turkey.
No fighting over drumsticks at this party.
Stop it.
How's everyone out here?
Great.
We were just talking about the rally.
- Really?
I'm glad you brought that up.
- They had it this afternoon.
- In front of city hall.
- It couldn't have gone better.
George stopped traffic by lying across the road on a psychiatrist's couch.
- The cameramen sure loved that.
- Cameramen?
What are we doing?
It's almost time for the 6:00 news.
You're gonna love this, Dr. Crane.
- What have you got there?
- The crab puffs.
- Shall I get you something else?
- Yes, please, bring me spring rolls.
Now, on the lighter side, did you ever ask yourself what if they held a rally and nobody came?
This is great.
This is great.
Eighty-six the spring rolls.
Bring me the freaking turkey.
- Frasier?
- Yeah, Dad.
You think we could talk for a second in the living room?
Yeah, sure.
Gee, sounds kind of serious.
- Yeah, it is, kind of.
- Well, what is it?
Oh, Roz, I didn't hear you come in.
I think you had the blender going.
Frasier, we were wondering, do you think you might be depressed?
Depressed?
Well, we've all noticed that you've put on weight lately.
We're worried that you might be eating obsessively.
Maybe I've gained a pound or two, but it's nothing I can't handle.
So you think you've got everything under control?
- Absolutely.
- It's time, Roz.
Remember when I had that babysitter who was stealing from me, so I had to put in the hidden camera?
Yes.
And you remember when you babysat for me?
- What about it?
- Just watch this.
Well, I think it's mealtime, baby Alice.
Let's see what's on tonight's menu.
Oh, yes, strained beef and lima beans.
All right, point taken, I've put on a pound or two.
But the camera adds ten.
Open up.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
You know, it's very good.
Here, I'll show you, here.
Oh, my.
All right, now it's your turn.
Now, come on.
No?
Still?
Well, you know, that's not even a proper spoonful.
Let's get you a full one.
That's a nice big one.
You know what?
Let's try something else.
How about some puréed chicken and yams?
This looks very good.
Now, here we are.
All right, here we go.
Come on, open up, open up.
No?
Well, if you're not hungry, you're not hungry.
Oh, my.
Wow, it's actually pretty good together.
Let's try that.
What's that you have in your sippy cup there?
- Is that apple juice?
- Oh, all right, enough, turn it off.
Well, I guess maybe you're right.
I am depressed.
What of it?
Well, we're just trying to help you to get to, you know, the next stage.
- Stage of what?
- Frasier you're dealing with the loss of your job as many people do with a death.
Only you've got yourself stalled in depression.
And I think you're gonna stay there until you let yourself grieve for everything you've lost.
Your job, your friends.
The money, your reputation You've gotta let it out, Frasier.
Well, I thank you all very much for your concern, but you know what?
If I was repressing anything, I would certainly know it.
The only thing I need to let out are these so-called big-and-tall lounge pants.
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah.
- Well, we gave it a shot.
- What will we do now?
Well, we can't push him.
If he's not ready, he's not ready.
- What was that?
- Was that Frasier?
If anyone's hungry, there's a freshly made Monte Cristo in the waffle press.
Oh, great.
Thanks, Fras.
Dr. Crane, you all right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
I'm quite sure.
Frasier, you're not famous anymore.
- What the hell did you do that for?
- No, no, Dad, he needed a push.
Yeah?
Well, look at him.
- This can't be good.
- No, it is good.
Let it all out, Frasier.
Let it all out.
That's good.
That's right, Frasier.
Let it out.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, I think that's probably enough now.
Okay.
- How much more can be in there?
- Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, that's probably enough now.
Okay.
I don't think I can get him to stop.
- But this is sickening.
- Yeah, what are we gonna do?
Somebody get that Monte Cristo in here.
Frasier, it's all in how you look at things.
Look at my life.
No career, no relationship, no hope You can say the same thing about me.
I was talking about you.
Dr. Crane, my Grammy Moon had a saying What are you trying to do, kill him?
Well, don't blame this on me.
She brought the bloody tape over.
Oh, so now this is all my fault.
You saw that tape.
I've seen your baby too.
She could stand to miss a meal or two.
- She's a healthy baby.
- Oh, stop it.
Stop it, all of you.
There is no hope.
It's over.
It's all over.
Well, look at that.
I'm so proud of you, boy.
Dad, you're just saying that.
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, please join me.
Thank you very much.
- I would love to have - Wait.
Mochaccino, extra whipped cream and a Linzer Torte, right?
Not anymore.
I'll just have a non-fat latte, please.
- Hey, didn't you used to?
- Yes, yes, I used to be on the radio.
With any luck, I will be again.
Thank you for remembering.
It does help.
I was just gonna say, didn't you also used to get a bear claw?
Off you go.
Well, Frasier, I just have to say bravo.
You're slim, well-adjusted.
You've really turned things around, haven't you?
Well, it's easy once you hit rock bottom and bounce.
Thank you, Niles, I couldn't have done it without you.
I did nothing you wouldn't have done for me.
And you'll be happy to know my own life is on quite the upswing as well.
Really?
I just got back from a meeting with Maris and her lawyers.
Oh, and?
I think this divorce is going to go very smoothly.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Oh, thank you.
That was a very childish prank.
Now you have ruined my coffee.
If you can't behave like adults, you shouldn't be coming to a grown-up cafe.
It wasn't us.
Aren't you gonna yell at them?
I'm sure they already heard me yell at you.
Niles, thank you for agreeing to meet me on such short notice.
I swear I'm in full-blown crisis.
If you're talking about that garish belt, I have emergency suspenders.
It's not the belt.
My high school reunion is tonight and you know my history.
- Oh, not this folderol again.
- It's not folderol.
- It's folderol.
- It's not folderol at all.
For God's sake, Niles.
Every time my reunion comes around, it coincides with a severe downturn in my life.
Five years ago, Lilith divorced me.
Five years before that, I was left at the altar.
Five years before that, I fell face first into the poison ivy.
And here we are, right on schedule, I'm freshly fired.
I still don't know why you even went that poison-ivy year.
Niles, the point is, in ten minutes, I have an extremely important job interview, a job for which I am eminently qualified, but that now I have no chance of getting.
Well, how can you know that?
Because destiny won't allow it.
Destiny's plan is for me to walk into that reunion this evening the way I always do, the class loser.
Pitied and shunned by everyone until I wind up sitting with the most pathetic people there.
You mean, the chess club?
Worse.
The chess club's barbershop quartet.
Oh, the Check Mates.
I swear to God, I feel like I have a curse on my head.
Frasier, you're a man of science.
You know curses don't exist.
There's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this.
You tripped and fell into the poison ivy.
Your radio station changed formats.
Your wife didn't love you.
If this is a pep talk, would you kindly segue to the peppy part?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The only reason you're giving credence to this curse mumbo-jumbo is you're nervous about your job interview.
But you're a talented professional.
Any station would be lucky to have you, wouldn't they?
- Yes, I suppose.
- So stop doubting yourself.
You deserve that job, so go out there and get it.
In an hour's time, it'll be yours, and after a short trip to the store to return that belt, you can thoroughly enjoy your reunion.
Well, you're right, Niles.
I should think positively.
This interview is gonna go just fine, and so is this evening.
All I have to do now is get a date.
Where am I gonna find a woman who is so desperate for an evening out that she'd agree to go to someone else's reunion?
Oh, hey, Frasier.
See?
Your luck's changing already.
Hello.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Steven Rugly's office.
- Well, you've come to the right place.
- Oh, splendid.
Is it possible to fetch me a coffee before my interview?
- Well - Better yet, make it a cup of chamomile tea with a squirt of lemon and a full teaspoonful of honey.
We'll try to get that for you just as soon as my assistant gets back.
I'm Steven Rugly, president of KJMC.
Oh, Lord, I'm It's nice to meet you.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Quite all right, Dr. Crane.
- It's a great suit, by the way.
- Thank you.
- Your - I know.
It's a bit risky.
People have been commenting on it all day.
Yes, it makes a bold statement, but frankly, I like the attention.
I cut through the park on the way over here.
It caught the eye of many a young lady.
Oh, my God.
My fly.
I thought you were talking about my belt.
Well, shall we start the interview?
Oh, good.
We haven't started yet.
Well I'm glad you could make it, Dr. Crane.
I've enjoyed your work.
Oh, that's very gracious of you, Mr. Ugly.
- That didn't come out right, did it?
- What do you mean?
The way I said your name right now sounded like I called you Mr. Ugly.
I assure you it won't happen again.
See, it's just a matter of separating the Rs.
Mr. Rug.
Mr. Rug.
Mr. Rug.
Ly.
Mr. Rugly.
Anyway, I think you might be a good fit here.
We need to find a replacement for Dr. Wendy.
- Really?
- Yes.
I didn't feel it was right to keep her on any longer.
Well, let me say I applaud your judgement on that score.
I mean, frankly, Dr. Wendy's saccharine style is maybe very popular, but, you know, really not up to your standards, is it?
Dr. Wendy's my mother.
- She's quite ill.
- Oh, well - Can I interrupt?
- Oh, please.
You have some messages.
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.
- Mr. Jameson has to cancel.
- Oh, very well.
Why don't you call Phyllis Monderer and see if she can reschedule?
Don't forget to pick up my car from the shop.
I already did.
It's across the street.
Some idiot parked his BMW in your space.
- Well, have it towed.
- I already made the call.
And can you call Walter Hecht and see if he can reschedule for Wednesday?
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.
We don't have any tea, but would you like some coffee?
Oh, that would be splendid.
Yes, thank you.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine, thank you.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
- Is this the giraffe from my bookcase?
- Yes, yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
I was admiring it.
It broke apart in my hands.
But if your child is anything like mine, he'd be delighted to make you a new one.
Actually, my father made it after his stroke.
Well, I think you've got enough to go on.
It was lovely meeting you.
I'm sorry, you know, I'm gonna have to dash if I'm gonna beat that tow truck.
Hold the elevator.
- Thanks.
- Hello, Dad.
Hi.
I'm never going to that grocery store across the street again.
They gave me such a hard time because I brought Eddie in.
Oh, well.
It's not exactly sanitary, Dad.
When they get rid of the guy with pinkeye who's handing out cheese samples, they can talk to me about sanitary.
Wait a minute.
Didn't you bring home a case of dog food yesterday?
Yeah, it was the economy stuff.
He wouldn't touch it, so I gotta take all this back.
This is his favourite kind.
Well, I guess what they say is true: Once you've tasted animal byproducts, you can't go back to the cheap stuff.
Hey, have you picked a restaurant for tonight?
I've got a better idea than that.
My old precinct's having one of their seized-property auctions down at the fairgrounds.
- Oh, what's the better idea?
- Oh, now, come on, Niles.
These drug dealers have some pretty nice stuff.
As much as I've been searching for a wide-brimmed, purple velvet hat, - it's really not my cup of tea.
- I'll tell you what.
We'll just go for a little while and then we'll come back here for dinner.
Am I glad you're home.
- What's wrong?
- It's Dr. Crane.
Since he came back from his job interview, he's seemed awfully depressed.
In fact, he's as bad as I've ever seen him.
- Oh, I guess it didn't go well?
- I gather not.
He mumbled something about it being worse than the Dresden premiere of Schumann's 2nd Symphony.
And you left him alone?
Where is he?
He's in the kitchen.
Oh, my God!
- Frasier, are you all right?
- I was fine before you screamed.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Daphne said you were depressed.
Here you are with your head in the oven.
I was cleaning it, Niles.
It's electric.
If I was going to end my life, I'd choose something quicker than broiling.
Sorry your interview didn't go well, Fras.
Oh, that's all right, Dad.
You know, things don't work out the way we'd like them to sometimes, much like my strict "no shopping carts in the apartment" policy.
Don't worry about it.
I'll take it back, but I need it to return all that cheap dog food.
I'm going to pick up cleaning supplies, I'll do it for you.
I thought you need to get ready for the reunion.
Oh, God, no.
I'm not going.
- Why?
- Because I'm cursed.
If I wasn't convinced of it before today's interview, I am now.
You haven't even heard anything.
For all you know, you might've gotten it.
Believe me, Dad, I have a better chance of being crowned Miss Teen U.S.A. Oh, dear God.
- Just how casual is this thing tonight?
- Roz, I am so sorry.
I completely forgot to call and tell you that, well, we're not going.
Wait a second.
I found a babysitter at the last minute.
I got a new dress.
I got Miguel to do my hair, and I just spent the last hour listening to the Estée Lauder lady describe her bladder operation just so I could get a free makeover.
- And now you say we're not going?
- Roz, I can't go.
You see, I have a curse on my head.
What curse?
He thinks the Fates are conspiring to humiliate him at every reunion.
Come on, you don't really believe that, do you?
All right, let's examine the evidence.
Daphne, will you assist me, please?
This is my school newsletter.
"The Bryce Academy Crier".
Which, coincidentally, was Frasier's nickname his first year there.
Just read it.
Scott Alexander.
What's he been up to?
"Wife, kids, has his own computer-software business".
Nancy Kearns.
"Mother of three, successful physician, has invented a drug that may aid in the treatment of cancer".
Cure for cancer.
Won't they be green with envy when I trump them with this little story about my life?
Frasier Crane, unattached, unemployed and living with his father.
He spends his days scrubbing his oven and is anxiously awaiting his upcoming tooth-cleaning.
Now, now, Frasier, everyone has ups and downs.
You know, for all we know, that cure for cancer didn't pan out either.
One can only hope, Dad.
I'll bet if you went in there with a sunny attitude, you'd have a good time.
You know, I tried sunny last time.
You know where it got me?
Table 97, singing "Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby" with the Check Mates.
- Maybe this time will be different.
- That's the mistake I always make.
Thinking this year, it'll be different.
That I can beat the curse.
That's what the curse does.
It makes you think you can beat it, but you can't.
I'm sorry, Roz.
I apologize.
I will make this up to you someday.
Right now, I am going to go down to the store and run a little errand for my friend, Eddie.
Tonight, I'll be coming back home and spending the evening with Daphne, doing some light housework and listening to my brand-new book on tape: Depression, Anxiety and Death.
As read by the author himself, Stanislav Monk.
Now who's cursed?
Excuse me, sir, there's a place to recycle those cans right over there.
Oh, I know.
On behalf of Mother Earth, I thank you.
That's the sort of person that drinks chocolate soda.
Come on, gotcha.
Frasier Crane?
Yes.
Percy Williams.
Well, good to see you.
Suppose you're on your way to the reunion.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Couldn't make it this year myself.
Little too much on my plate.
Things have gotten crazy.
I can see that.
Well, I heard you weren't on the radio.
Oh, you did?
You know, my wife heads up a charity that helps get homeless people back on their feet.
Yes, I know.
The Boot Strap Foundation.
It's very popular in my circle.
You should call them.
They could help you.
Me?
You know, this is very funny.
The shopping cart, the dog food.
I'm afraid you're suffering from the wrong impression.
Dog food?
Oh, it's not mine.
It's my father's.
Call them, Frasier.
No, no.
Really, you're mistaken.
I'm not homeless.
I live in that luxury building right there, Number 1901.
- Frasier, please, take this.
- I don't need it.
I drive a BMW.
I collect African art.
You always were a proud one.
- I'm not proud.
- Then take it.
And for God's sakes, spend it on food.
I just threw out a $200 belt.
Hey, how was the police auction?
You didn't miss anything, especially once it started raining.
I made out like a bandit.
Oh, look at this.
Those drug lords have the most incredible taste.
Christofle silver, Limoges, Orrefors crystal.
If I ever get married again, I'm going to register there.
- Hello, all.
- Hey.
- I thought you were staying home.
- Yes, well, not anymore.
I ran into Percy Williams down at the grocery store.
He mistook me for a street person.
If I don't go down there and defend myself, he'll be passing around that rumour along with the Swedish meatballs.
I'm glad you're going, Dr. Crane.
You'll have a nice time and you look great.
Thank you.
You have no idea how big you owe me.
Yes, I do, Roz.
I will never ask you for another favour again except, could you do something with your hair?
It seems to be leaning.
Frasier, when you called, I was in the tub with a pint of Häagen-Dazs.
Considering that was 15 minutes ago, I think I look pretty good.
And I appreciate it, Roz.
I really do.
Daphne, could you please help Roz getting finished?
- I'm finished.
- No, no, no.
Finish more.
Come on.
- And remember what I told you.
- Oh, yeah, right.
I'm a model-slash-doctor-slash- daughter of the duke of Luxembourg.
Yeah, come along, Your Grace.
Frasier?
Are you so desperate that you're trying to impress these people by having Roz pretend to be some sort of trophy girlfriend?
Trophy duchess.
Niles, it's the only way to beat the curse.
You could beat the curse by not going.
I tried that, Niles.
You see where it got me.
The curse found a way to humiliate me in absentia.
I've got to get down there.
Why?
In order to win the approval of a group of virtual strangers?
- I know it sounds foolish, Niles - No, no, it's not foolish.
It's human.
I think it's all about the feelings of inferiority you've been carrying with you since high school.
That's the real curse.
Only you're not the Bryce Crier anymore.
You're a successful man.
You have an opportunity for real growth here.
Not by trying to impress these people, but by realizing that they don't matter anymore.
Okay, I'm ready.
Oh, Roz.
You look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.
- But we're not going.
- What?
- Well, I'm sorry, Roz.
It's got something to do with my personal growth.
I don't care about these people anymore, and, you know, I want them to know it.
Frasier, I hired a babysitter twice.
I did my makeup twice.
I performed a miracle of engineering by taping myself into this dress twice, only to be stood up twice?
Technically, you did your hair once.
Shut up!
You know, someday, you're gonna need another favour from me, buddy.
And when that day comes, I hope you know what you can do with it.
- I have a pretty good idea.
- Well, do it twice!
- Well, that was something.
- Please, you call that a tantrum?
Maris used to do that once a week.
Poor thing needed help slamming the door.
Frasier, I was just talking to Duke on the phone and your agent clicked in.
She was calling from a pay phone and she couldn't really talk, but she said that KPOV wants you to host your own show for them.
My own television show?
- At KPOV?
- Congratulations, Frasier.
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.
Thank you all.
I just realized, this is an even bigger opportunity for personal growth.
Having a prestigious new job like this, and not even going to that reunion to boast about it.
It is a great opportunity, isn't it?
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Well, I must say, Frasier did have a run of bad luck this week.
I'm certainly glad it's finally turned out better for him.
No, he didn't really get a call.
I just made it all up.
His agent didn't call?
No, I just wanted to give the guy something to brag about.
Dad, I know you were trying to help but don't you think that's a little risky?
What if somebody knows it's not true?
Oh, no, you worry too much.
Who's gonna know?
Most of these people are from out of town.
They probably never even heard of KPOV.
I knew it.
When you said KPOV, I thought it sounded familiar.
And it's right here in Dr. Crane's newsletter.
His classmate Karl Degersdorff was just named station manager.
Won't that be nice for them?
They'll be working together now.
Oh, my God.
Come on, it's gonna be all right.
Don't worry about it.
This Degersdorff probably won't even show.
You know, he just got a new job.
He's probably real busy.
I guess you're right.
We mustn't assume the worst.
I'm acting like Frasier, as if there was really a curse.
Look here.
He's also serving as this year's reunion coordinator.
Good evening.
Hello.
Good to see you again.
Hi, how you been?
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi.
Hit it.
- Hello - Hello Hello Hello Goodbye my Coney Island baby Farewell my own true love True love, oh, honey I'm goin' to go away and leave you Never to see you any Never gonna see you any I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Don't walk away from me when I'm yelling at you!
I'll walk away from you if I want to.
- It's my house!
- Yes, don't I know it.
You have no respect for my stuff.
Well, if you had labelled the cassette Rodeo Bloopers, I wouldn't have taped over it, I would've thrown it away.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Forget it, Fras.
It's just I've been so tense lately, being out of work.
I know, it's not easy us both being home so much.
Yeah.
Well, I suppose that during this little in-between-jobs period, we should just try to be extra careful to not get on each other's nerves.
All right, I'll do that.
Good.
Dad, what's this?
Oh, a call came in for you.
Rebecca Wendell.
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't she that model you been after?
Not just a model, Dad.
A lingerie model.
I met her at the symphony.
Wow, this is amazing.
- When did this come in?
- About an hour ago.
- I was here an hour ago.
- Yeah, you were in the tub.
That didn't stop you yesterday when you came in to ask me if a peach smelled funny.
For God's sakes, Dad.
I'd like to know why this is my fault.
I put it there in the special-message bowl that we're all supposed to use.
Damn, it's her machine.
Thanks.
I've been looking forward to this for months.
Now you know how I feel about the rodeo tape.
For God's sake, the two things have no comparison!
Hello, Rebecca.
It's Frasier.
Sorry I missed you.
Please try again.
Bye.
I hope you're happy.
I have to sit here all afternoon waiting for the phone to ring.
- As opposed to what you normally do?
- Oh, that's rich coming from you.
A man who's spent the last five years welded to his aptly named La-Z-Boy.
Well, I'm not so lazy that I can't get the hell out of here.
- I haven't finished talking yet.
- I'm finished listening.
- As usual, running from the problem.
- Not the problem, the yammering.
You wanna tape over something?
Try your mouth!
- Hey, Martin.
- Oh, hi, Roz.
Decaf latte to go, please.
So is Frasier here?
I hope not.
Oh, he's just been such a pill lately.
You know, it's tough for people when they're out of work.
They just get a little tense and irritable.
To go, I said to go.
Maybe you need to take a little break from each other.
Have you ever thought about, I don't know, staying with Niles for a while?
Out of the frying pan, into the fire, huh?
Think about it.
Niles' place is so huge, and he's at work all the time.
Yeah, it's true.
And Maris is out of the picture now.
You know what?
I just thought of something.
For a while there, your daughters-in-law were Maris and Lilith.
- Whoa, happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.
Hey, Niles.
- Oh, hello.
- Niles.
I'm not interrupting anything personal, am I?
Yeah, Niles, we just eloped.
I'm your new mom.
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.
Latte, please.
Martin, why don't you tell Niles your new idea?
Well, actually, it was Roz's idea, but I think she might have something, you know.
Frasier and I have been kind of butting heads lately.
Well, Frasier has been very difficult.
I don't know how you live with him.
Well, that was Roz's idea.
She suggested that I move in with you for a while.
- Did she?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you know, we talked about it when I first got shot but, of course, Maris was the problem.
So I guess the big question now is, do you still want me?
Oh, don't be silly.
I want you just as much now as I wanted you then.
Well, I guess this is gonna work out.
- Thanks, Roz.
- Don't mention it.
The look on Niles' face is thanks enough.
Now, Dad, you're sure it won't bother you to live so far from the park and McGinty's Oh, no, no, not at all.
There's a bus that stops right in front of your place.
- Eddie and I don't mind taking the bus.
- Eddie?
Eddie.
You know, I just remembered, Dad, my building doesn't allow dogs.
Well, that's it then, because I'm not leaving Eddie.
Oh, of all the horrendous luck.
Oh, well, thanks anyway.
I guess I'll just look for a little place.
Can't be too small though, because I gotta have a bedroom for Daphne.
You know, Dad, about that no-dog rule, I could speak to Clarice, the head of our co-op board.
Oh, really?
You think they'd make an exception?
Well, let's just say she's bent quite a few rules in her day and if she doesn't want her husband to find out, she'll bend this one.
- That's great.
- Yes, well, then it's settled.
Daphne can move in straight away.
You and Daphne.
Great.
- Oh, hello, Niles.
- Frasier, where's Daphne?
I think at the market.
Hello, Dad.
Frasier, about this afternoon Look, let's just drop it, all right?
All's well that ends well, and this afternoon ended very well indeed.
Your underwear model called?
Just after you left, actually.
We spoke for about an hour, and we're having dinner together on Saturday night.
Well, that's great.
I hope everything works out.
Actually, Dad, on that score, you could make yourself scarce that night.
Well, actually, I'm moving in with Niles for a couple of months.
Well, have some confidence in me, Dad.
It won't take me that long.
No, no.
No, no, I mean it.
Niles and I have been talking about it.
Yes, and I think it's a fine idea.
I know I've been out of sorts lately, I hope I haven't made you feel unwanted.
No, no, it's nothing like that.
Listen, I've been living under your roof for five years now.
You've earned a little time to yourself.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Maybe you should sleep on it tonight.
- Frasier, Frasier, please.
Look.
You've had a chance to get closer to Dad these past few years, and I wouldn't mind having that same chance myself.
Frankly, I'm a bit jealous.
Well, I am sorry, Niles.
I guess I haven't been seeing this from your angle.
- Hello, all.
- Hello, Daphne.
Quite a little angle it is too.
Let me ask you something.
How would you feel about moving in with Niles?
- You serious?
- Yes.
- Just me?
- Yes.
No, no, and Dad.
Just till Frasier goes back to work.
It's been a little crowded around here.
Well, I won't argue with that.
You know, Dr. Crane has quite a few stairs.
- Are you sure you can manage them?
- Oh, sure.
Nobody knows better than you how well my hip's getting.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Here, let's get you packed.
Wait a minute.
I was hired as Mr. Crane's physical therapist, and if he can make it up and down that staircase of yours, he really doesn't need full-time care anymore.
This is hard for me to say, but maybe it's time I moved on.
We all knew this day would come sooner or later.
What about my exercises?
You'll do fine on your own.
Believe me, it's not that I want to go.
I'm very fond of you all.
I'm not like a psychiatrist, who works with someone for years and years and it doesn't matter if they ever get better.
My work here is done.
I have to go where I'm needed.
- Well, we need you.
- Dad needs you.
Look, it's not like I'm leaving right this minute.
I'll help you get settled in while I look for a new job.
- But, Daphne - Oh, please, don't make a big fuss about this.
You'll just make me cry.
This is no time for tears.
Well, I guess you know what's best.
It's sure gonna be Ionely though, just the two of us.
It won't just be the two of you, you'll have Eddie.
- Dad.
- Eddie, whatever you're on, get off.
I've been on hold with my employment agency forever.
And thanks again for making me feel so welcome here until I find a new job.
Yes, I'm here.
Nothing at all?
Not even part-time therapy?
Well, I'll stay in touch.
Bye-bye.
So no job yet, eh?
No, unfortunately.
Still, tragedies happen every day.
I mustn't give up hope.
I wish you'd consider staying here with us.
I don't know how Dad's gonna manage without you.
He doesn't need me anymore.
Nonsense.
I know he puts on a brave front, but the plain truth is, the man is practically an invalid.
All right, come back here.
- What's he got now?
- Oh, my sneaker.
You give me that back or I'm not taking you for your speed walk.
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad.
Hi, Niles.
Forgive me, I know how annoying it can be to drop by without calling.
Oh, don't worry, I used to do it.
That's how I know.
Hello, Eddie.
I've got a surprise for you, something you left at the house.
There we are.
Don't worry, Niles, you'll get used to it.
Oh, and, Dad, I've got a little surprise for you as well.
All right, boys, bring it on in here.
Oh, great, here it is.
Now this place is starting to look like home.
Yes, and finally so is mine.
Well, I'm just gonna go finish unpacking.
Well, you just follow him up with that.
Oh, no, no, leave it there.
That way I won't get my pizza cheese all over your fancy chairs.
Doesn't the cheese go in your mouth?
That's certainly the goal, but you can't hit that bull's-eye every time.
Okay, this isn't working out.
You have to take him back now.
- He's been here for eight hours.
- I don't care.
I only signed on for this because Daphne came in the bargain and she's leaving.
You have to help me, I'm desperate.
Niles, which wall should I hang my swordfish on?
None of them, I just had that room frescoed.
- Daph.
- Thanks, Rhonda, you're a lifesaver.
Bye-bye.
Well, good news on the employment front?
Yes, a friend of mine just got me an interview.
It's an elderly woman suffering from brittle bone disease, the poor thing.
Oh, well, normally I'd say break a leg but Oh, I'm gonna miss you.
All of you.
But like I told your brother, there's simply no reason for me to stay as long as your father's so strong and healthy.
Oh, dear God.
- Oh, my God, Dad.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
Come on.
- I don't know.
L - Oh, we just got tangled up there.
- Dad, I am so sorry.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, don't worry about it, it was an accident.
Well, you do seem to be in one piece.
Still, it was an awfully big fall.
Would you help me get some ice?
Good thinking, Daphne.
I know I could use a drink.
- Boy, that was so weird.
- Yeah.
Niles just kicked my cane out right from under me.
Yeah, I know he wants to keep Daphne around here but I didn't think he'd go that far.
Well, no, not deliberately, but maybe he was acting on an unconscious level.
What are you talking about?
I was just making a joke.
- Oh, well, then just skip it, Dad.
- No, no, wait a minute.
You think Niles was actually trying to hurt me?
No, no, it's just that sometimes, when the motivation is strong enough, the unconscious can cause a person to act in ways that the conscious would find unthinkable.
So you're saying that this wasn't an accident?
Oh, it's a crazy theory.
I'm sorry I even brought it up.
You know what?
I think I'll be off now.
Off to my bachelor pad.
I have a date tonight with a lingerie model.
Well, bachelor pad, lingerie model.
The sweetest words in the English language.
I'm sorry I won't be there.
Wait, we have a tie.
Frasier All right, Mr. Crane, I need you to take a seat so I can ice your hip.
I'm fine.
Why is everybody making such a big fuss?
- Wait, don't sit down.
- What?
- You nearly impaled yourself.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you, Daphne.
I don't know what it is about these things, they keep ending up in the oddest places.
Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.
Your voice sounds so sexy on your machine.
Anyway, I loved talking to you this afternoon, and I was thinking, instead of going to a noisy restaurant, maybe we could just stay in tonight, open some wine, curl up in front of the fire.
Just a warning though, I'm coming straight from a shoot so I'll be wearing my work clothes.
I can't believe I said that.
Bye.
Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.
Your voice sounds so sexy on your machine.
Anyway, I loved talking Boy, the floors around here are so slippery.
- Yes, I just had them polished.
- Well, I wish you would've told me.
Eddie just slid into a wall and chipped his tooth.
Now he whistles when he breathes.
Well, Dad, I can assure you, there'll be no slipping in here.
Look, a brand-new safety rail installed just for you.
And, as requested, traction decals.
Well, I don't need to worry about falling in Dad, are you okay?
Wow, yeah.
It's a good thing I wasn't in the shower, - I could've cracked my head open.
- Oh, Dad I guess I'm not much of a handyman, am I?
You put this thing up yourself?
Yes, my contractor was out of town.
Don't worry, you can use my bathroom to shower.
Just let me know when you do.
The plumbing's temperamental, if I were to run the dishwasher, you might be horribly scalded.
You know, I took an extra-Iong shower yesterday.
You know, that ought to hold me.
- You sure you don't need a hand?
- Just keep moving.
Guess what.
I got the job.
I can't believe it, I start in the morning.
- You what?
- I'll tell you about it later.
I have to call my employment agency right away.
- I can't let her leave.
I just can't.
- There's nothing we can do about it.
I still have a day.
Just have to be more resourceful.
Like how?
It's my problem, not yours.
I just have to think.
Fresh air.
Maybe that'll calm me down.
Oh, look at the sunset.
Dad, come join me on the balcony.
Eddie, get out of here, quick.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
Dad!
- Lord, what are you doing here?
- Look, we gotta talk.
- Now?
Not a good time.
- But it's getting spooky over at Niles'.
I know it's unsettling the way he changes into that Chinese dressing gown after dinner, but you'll get used to it.
No, I think his unconscious is trying to hurt me.
- Dad, that's preposterous.
- No, it isn't.
Can't we talk about this in the morning?
There is no way your own flesh and blood would try to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Well, at least let me get Eddie's pillow out of my room, will you?
All right, but just hurry it up, will you?
Daphne.
What is going on?
I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time.
- Well, actually, I'm waiting for a date.
- Well, I'll just run in and out.
I need to pick up my exercise mat.
Oh, good Lord.
Is everything all right?
I'm sorry, I think I'm just a bit nervous about my new job.
- Yes, yes.
- I'll be all right.
I just wish I didn't miss being here so much.
Oh, Daphne.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, you're gonna be just fine.
You know, transitions are always difficult.
The trick is just not to rush them.
Niles!
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm going out of my mind.
I am this close to living under the same roof with Daphne Before you go on, let me say one thing.
- What is it?
- Get out.
- Wait, wait, I need to talk about this.
- Is that Niles?
Dad, hey, why did you run off?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
- No, Niles, stay away from me.
- What?
Now, Niles, I'm not mad at you, just your unconscious.
It wants Daphne to stay around so bad that it's been trying to hurt me.
- What?
- Well, Frasier can explain it better.
Exactly who is hurting whom, and what does any of this have to do with?
- Daphne.
- Oh, look, we're all together again, - just like old times.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, God.
Well, we certainly do have a lot to talk about.
Tell you what, let's meet at Niles' for breakfast tomorrow.
I'm not getting in the elevator with him.
Dad, Daphne, go in shifts then.
You first.
- All right.
- Go on.
Eddie, you too.
Shake a leg, mister, let's go.
- Right now, out of here.
- Move it, move it, move it.
You actually convinced Dad I was trying to harm him?
Niles, I did no such thing.
I simply advanced a theory.
I had no idea he would take it to heart.
- Oh, balderdash.
- Oh, please, Niles.
Surely it's occurred to you, your desire for Daphne is forcing you to behave in very strange ways.
Or do you shove Dad down the stairs every day?
- That was an accident!
- Oh, Niles, any psychiatrist worth his salt knows that there are no accidents.
No one would do something like that, however unconsciously, unless they stood to gain from it.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank God.
We're here to help.
What did you kick my cane for?
It was an accident.
I was playing with Eddie.
My hip's killing me.
Dad, don't worry about it.
Niles has a nice comfy bed you can recuperate in.
I can't go up and down those stairs now!
The best thing would be for him to stay with you.
He'll need full-time attention.
I'll cancel my job All right, just hold it!
Nobody's cancelling anything.
The man fell down stairs today.
He could hardly have been hurt worse stumbling in a carpeted hallway.
All right, now get up, you big crybaby.
No pain, no gain.
- Oh, no, but it hurts!
- Boohoo, I want you out of here.
I don't care if you have to crawl like a bog turtle.
Rebecca.
I didn't see you standing there.
Why don't you just step on over my father, help yourself to some wine?
What kind of a heartless bastard are you?
No, Rebecca, you don't understand.
It's not the way it looks.
He's very resilient.
He's been shot before.
Dr. Crane, we really should get him inside.
Yes, just give me a moment.
All right, bring him in.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Well, I'd better be heading out.
Niles and I are meeting for dinner.
And then we have tickets - to the theatrical event of the season.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir Trevor Ainsley in Tears of the Mariner.
It promises to be a very exciting evening.
You see, Seattle is Sir Trevor's last stop on his farewell tour.
After this, he's retiring from the stage forever.
Tears of the Mariner.
I think I read a review of that.
I thought it was one of those baseball stories like Pride of the Yankees.
But it's just about some crabby old sailor stuck in this little town No, no, Dad, please.
I have carefully avoided all the reviews of this play.
I don't wanna hear about it before I see it.
Well, I don't wanna hear about it after you see it.
- Oh, hello, Daphne.
- Hey, Daph.
That's it?
"Hello, Daphne"?
Haven't you seen the paper?
No, I glanced at it.
Why?
Did I miss something?
Look.
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that you?
- Yes.
Good heavens.
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.
You've got your back turned to the camera and your skirt's blown up around your Oh, well, it must have been rather blustery out.
I was in the park yesterday.
This photographer snapped my picture for the "It's Your Seattle" column.
The one where they show some average person out and about, then use their name on the column.
If they took a picture of Mr. Crane, the caption would read, "Martin Crane's Seattle".
If they took one of you, it would say, "Frasier Crane's" Yes, we get it.
Don't crinkle it.
I want to send it home to my family.
- You sure about that?
- Oh, don't be such an old fogy.
So I'm bending down and me knickers are showing a bit, but my family will still be as proud as peacocks when they see that.
"Daphne Moon's Seattle".
She certainly does.
Niles, will you just stop it?
The dinner was just fine.
It was not fine.
I made those reservations weeks ago.
They seated us so close to the kitchen I'm surprised they didn't make us wear hairnets.
- I'm sure it was just a mix-up.
- Not a mix-up.
It's part of an alarming trend I've noticed - since Maris and I parted company.
- Oh, Niles.
Last week, Roberta Phipps snubbed me at the opera.
I wasn't even invited to that gala fundraiser for Saint Andrew's Orphanage.
You can still send money to the children.
As usual, you've missed the point.
I'm being shut out.
It is as if someone snuck into my world and changed all the locks.
Oh, Niles.
Well, at least you don't have to worry about that tonight.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Evening.
Tickets, please.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
These aren't for this performance.
- What?
- What?
But they say for the 16th.
There's the 16th right there.
- That's today.
- Yes, sir.
They were for the matinee.
No, no, this had to be some mistake.
Let me just - Oh, dear God.
- I'm so sorry, Niles.
Well, surely you must hold some tickets aside for emergencies.
- We'll take anything, anything at all.
- Yes, yes, even mezzanine.
If you like, you can try your luck in the cancellation line.
How could this happen?
I have to see this play.
I have to have people see me see this play.
- If I'm not seen seeing this play, see - Niles, Niles.
I will make a simple phone call, and we'll get house seats for tomorrow night.
- All right?
- I suppose so.
Come on, let's go.
The last thing I need is to have someone see us loitering here like gutter riffraff, pathetically scrounging for last-minute tickets.
Good luck.
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello.
I know I'm early.
I was hoping we might get a bite to eat.
Actually, Niles It'll be on me as a thank-you for getting those replacement tickets.
- About the tickets - I know I owe you money.
And my gratitude, and if I keep talking, you won't be able to tell me you weren't able to get the tickets.
- I haven't been able to get them yet.
- I knew you wouldn't get them.
- Niles, please.
- It's too late.
It's 6:00.
Please just calm down.
I've made a few well-placed calls.
I haven't heard back from a couple of people.
Someone will call.
Well, someone better call, because everyone who's anyone is seeing this play.
You know who you are if you're not anyone?
You're no one.
And I've been someone much too long to start being no one now.
Oh, hey, I thought no one was here.
Niles, please, just relax.
One way or another, we are going to get tickets.
You two still going on about those tickets?
If this play's any good, in a couple of years, they'll do it at the dinner theatre and you can get a nice prime rib with it.
Dad, you don't understand.
You see, this isn't just about the play.
This is literally our last opportunity to see one of the finest actors of our time.
You wanna go because your snobby friends are going and you don't wanna feel left out.
What we want is to sit in a theatre and share a transcendent experience.
- That nobody else could get tickets to.
- That's the transcendent part.
It's them.
Hello?
Yes, I'll hold.
It's Clea Fenwick.
- Clea Fenwick?
- Yes, you remember her.
She's on the board of the theatre.
You've seen her.
Bad eye job.
Dowager's hump you could cross the Sahara on.
Hello, Clea, you lovely thing.
Oh, well, you're a dear for trying.
Thanks.
Don't despair, Niles.
I'm getting another call.
Hello?
Yes, Dora.
Yes.
Too bad.
Well, thank you.
Yeah Oh, that is a wonderful idea.
Yes, I will.
- Thank you.
Bye-bye.
- She has a lead for us?
Yes.
She said I should call Clea Fenwick.
This is hopeless.
Niles, there is another way.
- You don't mean?
- Yes.
I know it's a calculated risk.
It's a little uncertain.
- You can't be serious.
It's unthinkable.
- Niles, what other choice do we have?
But the indignity.
It reeks of desperation.
Now, now, before you do anything desperate, at least go and stand in the cancellation line.
What did he think we were talking about?
You know, this isn't half as humiliating as I thought it would be.
Oh, you're right.
I don't know why we were so afraid.
Oh, no.
There's Steven and Susan Kendall.
Quick, turn around.
If they see us here, we'll be ruined.
- They know everybody.
- Yes, I know.
Their Sunday brunches are a who's who of Seattle's elite.
I think it's safe.
No one saw us.
- Hey, Frasier, Niles.
- Hi, Roz.
- What are you doing here?
- And how did you get tickets?
A friend couldn't use hers so she gave them to me.
I asked my cute new dentist.
He's a big fan of Sir What's-his-face.
You refer to the world's greatest living actor as Now, Frasier, Roz may not be familiar with Sir Trevor, but I'm sure she'll enjoy the play.
- I trust you got good seats.
- I think so.
- Row C. - Row C. Excellent.
Look, a whole bunch of naked men.
What are you doing?
Give me those.
You don't even know his name.
Are you crazy?
- Ready to go, Roz?
- Yes.
- Dr. Mandel?
- Oh, hi, Niles.
You two know each other?
Sure.
How's the teeth bleaching going?
Fine, thanks.
Let's go, Rob.
It's a long way to Row C from the cancellation line.
Hang in there, guys.
I wouldn't be surprised if you get lucky.
I'd be stupefied if you didn't.
I knew you were bleaching them.
"No, really, I just changed toothpastes".
Is that Niles Crane?
And Frasier?
- Susan, Steven, good to see you.
- We're seeing everybody tonight.
It's simply Oh, dear.
You're not waiting for a cancellation, are you?
A what?
Oh, is that what this is?
Oh, look at us.
Blocking these poor unfortunates who couldn't get tickets.
I got one pair left.
Who's next?
- Curtain going up.
- Curtain going up.
Shall we?
- Next in line, please.
- Niles, are you coming?
You'll have to forgive Niles.
He's too ashamed to admit that he's just waiting for one last cigarette.
It's all right.
You go ahead.
- I'll just see the Kendalls in.
- Thank God, another smoker.
Darling, maybe I'll just stay and have a cigarette with Niles.
Do you want these tickets, sir?
Me?
No, no, no.
Steven, please, I'd really like to sit down.
All right.
Niles, we'll make a date.
I'll meet you here at intermission and we'll have a smoke.
Right here is where I'll be.
- Enjoy.
- See you later.
Well, this is just perfect.
Not only are we missing the play, but we have to hang around until intermission so they won't catch on to us.
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who has an hour to learn how to smoke.
Niles, they're coming out.
Come on, let's blend in.
- Niles, what are you doing?
- I'm practising.
I haven't held a cigarette since I played Duke Mantee in our junior high production of The Petrified Forest.
Yes, I remember watching you from the petrified audience.
Come on.
Oh, there they are.
Let's go.
- Oh, well, you got out here quickly.
- Yeah.
I guess you needed one of these more than I did.
Yes, well, when you enjoy smoking as much as I do.
Bye-bye, feel better.
I'll call you.
The Gormleys.
Kendra isn't feeling well.
- Richard is taking her home.
- Oh, well.
- There's Miggy and Lyle.
- Poor old dears.
They could only get balcony.
Still, we should say hello.
They are your parents.
Excuse us.
Yes.
Thank God.
Those things are turning me green.
Never mind that, Niles.
The Gormleys aren't coming back.
Let's sneak into their seats and watch the second act.
Come on, let's go.
- Your ticket stubs, please.
- Oh, I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry, we've had some people try to sneak in after intermission.
Well, you know, I think we left our coats in our seats, and the stubs are in the coats.
- Oh, well, don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
We'll have someone bring your coats.
Where are your seats?
I'll have to check the seating chart.
- Aren't you going in?
- Oh, yes, yes.
My brother just needed to have one last cigarette.
- Oh, you're worse than Steven.
- Yes, yes.
Really, Niles, I do wish you'd quit.
I'm begging you.
I just wish I didn't love the damn things so much.
Yes, well, if we don't see you afterward, have a lovely evening.
Actually, we're having a small supper at La Chanteuse afterwards for Sir Trevor.
So if you're not busy, say, around 11?
Good.
We'll see you then.
Frasier.
Dinner with Sir Trevor.
That's better than seeing the play.
Niles, are you insane?
We know absolutely nothing about the damn play.
How can we possibly talk with this man?
For God's sake, I just wish I'd read that review in yesterday's paper.
- Do you still have it?
- I might.
Dad lets the papers pile up for days sometimes.
You know what?
We've got just enough time to get there and back.
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?
You see?
I told you it was the other way.
Now.
- What's going on?
- We're looking for yesterday's paper.
- Well, it should be there.
- Oh, wait, Dad.
That review you're reading yesterday, Tears of the Mariner.
- Do you remember it?
- Kind of.
All right, just concentrate.
What was the play about?
Well, let me see.
It started out with this old guy who was gutting a fish.
All right, okay, good.
And then he gives this fish to his son, but his son rejects it.
Good, good.
Then what?
Oh, yeah.
Well, then it turns out that he has this fatal disease.
And the next thing you know, he's in this big stadium, and he's telling everybody that even though he's dying, that today, he considers himself the luckiest man Dad, that is Pride of the Yankees.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.
But I'm pretty sure that fish part was right.
- This is ridiculous.
- Fish part.
- Wait, wait.
Yes.
- Yes.
Here it is.
There it is.
"Sir Trevor Ainsley's bravura performance in Tears of the Mariner qualifies him as an" "Continued on page A-16".
A-16.
Just give me a second here.
- Where is it?
- Daphne.
Her picture must've been on the other side.
It may still be here.
She was gonna mail it to her mother.
Daphne's picture was in the paper?
Yes, well, someone snapped a candid photo of her in the park.
It's not her most flattering angle, but I'm sure you would disagree.
Well, open it.
Carefully.
Oh, what the hell.
I'll buy her flowers.
Hey, Dr. Crane, I thought you went?
- Is that my letter?
- Daphne, let me explain.
I should've known I'd never get privacy in this house.
You don't understand.
I wanted to You just wanted to find out if I was gossiping about you to my mum.
Well, fine, I was.
A 73-year-old woman in Manchester is about to find out that you dye the grey out of your temples.
There, you happy?
No, I'm not happy.
I am mortified.
How did you know that?
I keep my hair dye in the false bottom of my cufflink box.
Yeah, well, I'll let it go this time.
We haven't got time for this.
We've gotta get down to that party.
- I knew you were dying your hair.
- Shut up.
"No, no, really, it's just my new conditioner".
Shut up.
And whatever you do, don't get specific about the play.
That's the mistake you made last year when you lied about seeing The Silent Echo.
All that yammering on about how the play had third-act problems.
- It fooled no one.
- What makes you so sure?
Well, for starters, The Silent Echo doesn't have a third act.
Bravo!
Thank you.
God, I need a drink.
- Double Scotch, no ice.
- Yes, sir.
Frasier, Niles.
How nice.
Sir Trevor, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
- And his brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
- It's an honour.
- How do you do?
- Two of our pre-eminent psychiatrists.
- We're huge fans.
- Huge.
They've set up a table for us in the private room.
Shall we?
No, I'll just finish this and be right along.
Perhaps the two doctors will keep me company.
I'd love to hear a psychological interpretation of the play.
All right, but don't be too long.
So tell me, as students of the human psyche, did my character ring true?
Oh, yes, so true.
I can honestly say I never saw a false moment.
Well, what about the third act?
The play clearly has a third-act problem.
At least it has a third act, unlike The Silent Echo which really could have used one.
I quite agree.
I did The Silent Echo in London last year.
What did you think of the hat scene?
The hat scene.
Well You know, the most important thing about the hat scene, and I have to stress this Dear God, is that clock right?
I have to call the sitter and tell her I'm going to be late, the children worry so.
- Well, back to the play.
- Right.
Well, you, of course, were brilliant.
Oh, please, Dr. Crane, I just want your professional analysis of what you saw tonight.
Well, it Of course, I could discuss subtext, metaphor and imagery with you, but you see, I I come to the theatre to feel, to be moved.
And that's exactly what happened to me tonight.
Really?
When?
When?
Well, let me see.
It was There was that The gutting-the-fish scene.
You made the most heartbreaking gesture.
It was, you know, the one with your hands.
You You mean, when I offer the fish to my son, and he turns his back to me, and I reach out to him like this: Yes, it's even more moving the second time.
Well Who knows why a moment like that touches us so?
But You see, that is your gift, Sir Trevor.
You've given us hundreds of moments.
Moments so real, so compelling, that we are revealed in their truth.
You don't know how refreshing this is to meet someone who doesn't just come to the theatre but who gives himself over to it.
That crowd in there, they only come because it's fashionable.
They don't care about art.
I can spot them at a glance.
The poseurs, the frauds.
Oh, here comes your brother.
The kids are fine.
Excuse me, Sir Trevor, they're waiting for you in the dining room.
Very well.
And thank you, Dr. Crane, for your integrity and your passion.
You are the reason that actors act.
I'm sorry I deserted you, but obviously you carried the day.
- Bravo.
- Oh, yes, bravo for us.
What do you mean?
Do you realise what we missed tonight?
A potentially life-changing experience in the theatre.
And why?
Because we were too embarrassed to be seen in a cancellation line.
Well, admittedly, it was a bit shallow.
Yes, it was more than shallow, it was shameful.
You're right.
What were we thinking, kowtowing to a group of snobs like that?
We weren't thinking.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Frasier, Niles.
Oh, Susan, I'm so sorry, but we can't stay.
Oh, no.
Sir Trevor will be so disappointed.
He was quite taken with you.
Well, send him our apologies.
It really was wonderful to meet him.
I know this is short notice, but if you're free this weekend, we're having one of our Sunday brunches.
Senator Logan is coming and Maria de Falco and the Whitneys - Just thank you, but I'm afraid we - Oh, please try.
I'll hold it open for you.
Check your books and let me know.
Well, how's that for irony?
Sunday brunch at the Kendalls'.
An hour ago, we would have leapt at that invitation.
Not anymore.
We've got a damned sight too much integrity.
Although Are we being selfish?
- Possibly.
How?
- Here's my thinking.
Why do shallow people remain that way?
The lack of positive influence.
Perhaps our brand of integrity is what that group needs.
We can be like politicians who change the system from within.
Exactly.
And who knows?
Maybe it'll rub off on Senator Logan.
- He'll bring it back to Washington.
- We have to go.
Yes.
What are you wearing?
- I'm gonna wear my new Prada suit.
- You're a fashion plate and a patriot.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Dr. Crane, I just wanted to tell you how much I miss your show.
Oh, well, thank you so much.
I miss it too.
Yes, the brisk exchange of ideas, the crackling interplay between me and my callers.
Well, you're very kind.
See that, Roz?
The public still craves the kind of excitement that only Frasier Crane can provide.
Roz!
I am so sorry.
The baby kept me up all night long last night.
I'm trying to get her used to her crib, but she just hates to sleep alone.
Well, the acorn certainly doesn't fall far from I have got to wake up.
I'm on my way to an interview.
I'd kill for a cup of regular coffee, but I'm still nursing, so I can't.
You know, it was just all I could do to get myself dressed and then feed the baby this morning.
Yes, well, next time, maybe you should try feeding first and dressing second.
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.
- How did I miss this?
- Well On the plus side, it does divert the eye from the blueberries in your teeth.
What?
I can't go to this interview like this.
- Of course you can.
- Oh, I'm just gonna call and cancel.
No, Roz, no, please, just check your teeth, yes, put your jacket on, and I swear, you'll look every inch the smart career gal on the go.
- There.
- Thanks, Frasier.
Hey, Roz.
Is that the newest thing, wearing two different shoes?
Oh, my God!
Hi, Dad.
So, what brings you here?
Well, I thought you needed a little cheering up.
You've been kind of mopey lately.
Well, I had kind of a rough night at the wine club.
During the blindfolded tasting, I gave four stars to a Mexican Zinfandel.
Well, I don't just mean last night.
I mean, you've been kind of down ever since you lost your job, you know?
And you haven't had a date in I don't know how long.
I know how long, and this isn't the way to cheer me up.
Don't worry.
I found a girl for you.
Now, Duke's daughter Marie just moved back in town Dad, blind dates remain the refuge of the lovelorn.
If you didn't talk like that, you might not have to get set up so much.
Now, listen, she's not a blind date.
You know Marie.
- Spent a week with her at the lake.
- She was 6 years old!
Duke said she's grown into a real looker.
Yes, well, I have seen Duke.
And unless he sired a love child with Catherine Deneuve, I don't like my odds.
- Uncle Martin!
- Oh, Marie!
Look at you.
You remember Frasier?
Bonjour!
I don't know when I've had such a delicious meal.
You really made this dessert yourself?
Well, yes.
It's a little something I like to call Crane brûlée.
You always were a gourmet.
Even at the lake, whenever we had fish sticks, you insisted on white grape juice.
Is everything all right there?
It's just a little quirk of mine.
I like to keep things straight, you know, in parallel lines.
Yes, I noticed that earlier with the asparagus.
It's weird, I know.
It used to drive my mother crazy.
Well, you know, we all have our little idiosyncrasies.
- How is your mother, anyway?
- Still on my case.
After the divorce, things just got worse.
Oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I'm sorry.
I'll stop.
Look.
Anyway, I haven't figured out how to have a normal relationship with her.
You know, we're all striving to have what we call "normal" relationships.
But who really knows what normal is?
- You can move it back now.
- Thank you.
What do you say we have our wine out on the balcony?
- The balcony?
- Yes.
You haven't had a chance to see the view.
Wow!
That is some view, all right.
Beautiful.
- You're afraid of heights, aren't you?
- I'm taking classes.
They give us these exercises to do.
They just work better when you're standing on a little milk crate.
Oh, I must seem totally neurotic.
Not at all.
I guess I'm going a little nuts since I moved in with my dad.
Thank God, I'm getting my own place next week.
Oh, yes, well, I suspect that will help a lot.
You know, very often, the key to mental health is distancing ourselves from our parents.
I'm home.
Oh, hey!
Sorry to barge in on you kids.
That's all right.
Why don't you join us for dessert?
Oh, thanks anyway, but I had Crane brûlée for lunch.
I did a little dry run earlier.
I wanted to make sure my carameliser wasn't on the fritz.
I was proud the first time he brought that blowtorch home - until I saw what it was for.
- Dad!
Oh, no, I'm only joking.
She knows that.
He's a great kid, Marie.
I mean, sure, he's out of work now, but he's hit the skids a lot of times, and he always manages to bounce right back up.
I think you've sprinkled enough pixie dust for one evening.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, good night, you two.
- I should probably get going too.
- All right.
Thank you for a great evening.
And for all the wonderful advice.
It was very insightful.
You're quite welcome, Marie.
Perhaps you can offer me a little insight as well.
Will this be our only night together or will I see you again?
Well, you're pretty good at interpreting things.
Maybe this will answer your question.
Well, then, you have a nice life.
And just as this hunter catches up to me and is about to kill me, I wake up on the cot in my dad's oak-panelled rumpus room.
That is a terrifying nightmare.
Are there any other figures in the rumpus room?
No, that's not part of the dream.
I really sleep there.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Can we talk about this after the museum tonight?
Oh, of course.
I thought it was the opera tonight.
No, the museum opening.
You promised me in the shower this morning, remember?
Yes.
But I was under duress.
You had a loofah to my head.
Oh, Niles, you just missed Duke's daughter.
I saw!
Is it possible that's the same little girl we used to refer to as "The Ugly Dukeling"?
- She is stunning.
- Isn't she, though?
You know, the insecure part of me has trouble figuring out why she's going out with me.
I mean, she could have her pick of men.
And I am a little older, haven't been to the gym as often as I should, and you can feel free to contradict me anytime you like, Niles.
You must have something, because she's clearly charmed by you.
Yes, well, whatever the reason, we certainly have the most wonderful time together.
We have the greatest discussions.
I've been helping her sort through some of her issues.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
It's a very complex relationship with her mother which has given rise to several striking phobias and a recurring dream.
And the most charming little obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Oh, well, then, there you go.
Perhaps she's attracted to you because of your psychiatric expertise.
Well, what are you suggesting, Niles?
That Marie's going out with me just to get free therapy?
- Well, it was just a thought.
- That's a mean-spirited thought.
Marie's not using me.
She would want me just as much even if I weren't a psychiatrist.
Why, you're jealous.
You're jealous that I'm having sex.
Jealous that I'm having hot, passionate, sweaty, jungle sex.
What are you having?
I'm having a latte.
Will this be all right for you?
Is there enough light here for you to see her?
Yeah, I'm telling you, Phil, she's really cute.
You'll see for yourself in a couple of minutes.
Oh, wait.
She's coming in now.
I gotta go.
- Hey, Daphne, how's it going?
- Fine.
- Good.
- What are you so chipper about?
Oh, nothing.
It's a beautiful night out.
Say, why don't you come out and have a look at the moon with me?
- Why, is it full?
- I don't know.
All right.
- It's a beaut, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah, very romantic.
Now, wait!
Wait!
Come here, come here.
I gotta show you something else too.
Over here.
Look at that, the way the moonbeams bounce off that reflecting pool.
Oh, yeah, that's really something.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.
You're signalling to someone.
Well, all right.
I did such a good job with Frasier, I thought maybe I could fix you up with some nice guy.
Is it that man up there with the binoculars?
Yeah, isn't that a great building?
He does real well.
He owns half that floor.
- Mr. Crane!
- What?
I don't believe it!
Putting me on display, like a bloody concubine!
Well, you get a turn too.
I got this telescope set up so you could have a look at him.
See, he liked you.
Hello?
Yeah, well, I told you she was pretty.
What do you mean, can I show you another one?
What do you think I'm running here?
So there I am, actually biting the fingernails of the same hand that's holding the phone, not two minutes after I'm on with my mother.
- Isn't that so revealing?
- Well, yes.
Yes, I'd say it is.
Is everything okay, Frasier?
You seem a little quiet.
No, no, I was just so enjoying our museum chat, I was wondering how we got on to the subject of mothers.
Well, it was a Whistler exhibit.
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just a bit tense.
Why didn't you say something?
I'll give you a little massage.
Oh, really?
Well, all right, if you think that'll help.
It's such an amazing feeling, being in the presence of so much beauty.
Yes, well, you say that now.
In six weeks, you'll be telling me to lose weight.
The Whistler, I know, I know.
Gosh, isn't it great that we both enjoy art so much?
- I could just talk about it all night.
- Me too.
Oh, you know, I couldn't help noticing your staring at that riverscape.
You couldn't take your eyes off of it.
Yeah, I think it's because it reminded me of my recurring dream.
You know, we were gonna talk more about that.
Oh, yes, yes.
The dream, being pursued by the hunter and the arrows.
- Yeah.
- Well You know, I'm not really feeling up to talking about it right now.
Do you think we could do it some other night?
All right.
What did you think of the riverscape?
Oh, well, I enjoyed it.
I was also enjoying what you were doing just now.
I'm sorry.
My hands were just getting a little bit of a cramp.
Oh, well, then let me do you, then.
Oh, actually, it's getting late.
You know, maybe I should get home.
Thought you were spending the night.
Oh, I'd like to, but I have an early morning and I hate to rush.
I had a great evening tonight.
You know, about that dream, I did have one thought.
- Really?
- Yes.
Forest imagery very often represents our most primal emotions, hence its frequent use in fairy tales, which could be a link to your childhood.
You are so good at this.
Much better than my therapist.
- You have a therapist?
- Oh, not anymore.
Who can afford it?
Anyway, you know, my hands are feeling much better.
Why don't we give that massage another shot?
Oh, yeah.
So I noticed that I often have this dream right after I talk to my mother.
Boy, your muscles are so tense.
Is it just your neck or all over?
It's all over.
Frasier, Frasier, you will not believe this.
Little Alice said her first word today.
It was "ma".
Or it may have been "moo".
Mary, that's the sitter, gave her this little toy cow.
She's always doing stuff like that.
I love Mary.
I love this little cow too.
It's the cutest little thing.
It's brown and white.
That's a Jersey cow, right?
That's where Mary's from, Jersey.
Yeah!
I'll take a splash more.
You know, I stopped nursing yesterday and, boy, have I missed this stuff.
Cup of mud, java, my old friend joe.
That's funny, Mary's husband's name is Joe.
Oh, my God, he's picking her up.
I gotta go.
This has been fun.
You look great.
Nice talking with you.
- Frasier, may I join you?
- Well, of course, Niles.
And I'm sorry about yesterday.
No, no, I'm the one who should be apologizing.
I never meant to suggest that Marie was Niles, Marie and I broke up.
I'm sorry.
Did she at least give you a reason?
I broke up with her, but thank you for the daily shot in the arm of confidence.
I talked to Duke.
What the hell did you break up with Marie for?
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't mean to cause a rift between you and your friend, but I couldn't continue with it.
You see, once I confirmed that Marie was primarily interested in me as a sounding board for her problems, I just had to end it.
Just as Niles suggested I should.
I never suggested that!
Well, no, all I said was that one of the things she might appreciate about you is your psychiatric expertise.
If you were a world-class chef, she'd appreciate your cooking.
If you were a stand-up comedian, she'd appreciate your jokes.
If you were a dermatologist, she had a big growth coming out of her face Yes, Dad, I get it.
Thank you.
I am sorry, but if you had let the relationship continue, she might have found other things that she'd appreciate about you just as much.
Maybe there's still time to win her back.
It'd take a pretty big bouquet of flowers to do that.
I don't know.
Maybe if I explain what really happened, she'll forgive me.
Sometimes the best apology is the truth.
You'll tell her you thought she was prostituting herself for therapy, but now you've decided that's okay?
Well, not that truth.
Some other truth.
- Good evening, Dad.
- Hey, you two.
How was dinner?
It was great.
We went to my favourite restaurant, this little Korean barbecue.
Yes, it's just fabulous.
You get to cook your own food on this little grill that's right in the centre of the table.
It splatters a little bit, but, you know, that's what makes it fun.
Well, clearly, you had a marvellous time.
- Oh, hello again, Marie.
- Hi, Niles.
If we're gonna go away, I should make reservations.
Right.
I tell you what, use the phone in my bedroom.
I'll be in in a minute.
Actually, just thinking about getting away is making me feel more relaxed already.
- She has a little problem with heights.
- I saw that.
Well, I'm sure glad you guys patched things up, anyway.
You know, Duke and I go back a long way.
Got a lot of friends, but there's something I get from Duke - that I don't get from anybody else.
- Seahawks tickets.
And don't think that SOB wasn't ready to pull them, either.
Dad dragged me to one of those Korean barbecues once.
I've had that suit dry-cleaned three times.
Eddie still greets me in a carnivorous frenzy every time I wear it.
Yes, well, the next time Marie and I go out for dinner, I'm gonna pick the restaurant, preferably one where the stove gets its own room.
Well, she certainly seems smitten with you.
Yes, she certainly does, doesn't she?
And I'm quite captivated with her.
You know, I can't put my finger on exactly why, but I'm just glad things are going well for you.
Are they ever.
I find her more enchanting each day.
Oh, you know what?
I am particularly intrigued by this recurring dream she has.
She's in the woods, she's being pursued by a hunter.
And get this, when she turns to confront the pursuer, - the hunter has no face.
- Fascinating.
I'm determined to get to the bottom of it.
I'm sure it would shed light on her mother issues and this fear of heights.
Oh, God, I've just discovered that she absolutely refuses to touch a doorknob with her bare hand.
Thanks to my natural chivalry, I missed that for a whole week.
Is that all you talk about, her problems?
Well, no, no.
We talk about lots of things.
Art, the theatre.
Why?
- Oh, it's just a passing thought.
- Well, pass it over here.
Well, you were asking what most captivated you about her.
Perhaps she's giving you a chance to exercise your psychiatric muscles.
- What?
- You've been out of work for a while.
Niles, Marie is a stunning woman with a body to die for, and you think all I'm interested in is her mind?
How shallow do you think I am?
Well, there's no need to get defensive.
There's not a problem, unless she's falling in love with you and you're only interested in her as a case study.
I assure you, I am interested in all aspects of Marie, not just her psyche.
For God's sakes, you know, I could happily go for weeks without discussing it once.
- Glad to hear it.
- Well, thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I have someone waiting for me in the other room.
Oh, dear God!
Unhand me, you wretch!
Oh, you vile creature!
Oh, for God's sake, you miserable Niles, please, drop him a Liv-A-Snap!
Oh, let go of me!
Let go of that leg, you My father's best friend.
Well, after your father.
We're all booked for this weekend.
There's a lake, hiking.
Sounds like a perfect place to relax.
You know, I do love the country.
It's so relaxing.
I swear to God, I'm out like a light as soon as my head hits the pillow.
Then we'll have to ask for a room with no pillows.
Oh, that reminds me, I had that dream again.
But this time, I saw the hunter's face.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You'll never guess who it was.
- Who?
- No, no.
- Is something wrong?
No, it's just that I'd rather not discuss the dream right now.
Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry.
Like you even care who the hunter is right now.
Yes, there are so many other things I'm more interested in.
- Yeah, that's better, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Do you feel relaxed?
- Was it your sister?
- What?
The hunter.
It was your sister, wasn't it?
No.
I thought you didn't wanna talk about this.
Oh, God, you're right, you're right.
I don't.
I really I really don't.
I'd much rather be exploring other things right now, like your lips and your chin - and your neck.
- Oh, keep going.
Oh, for God's sake, who was it?
- What is with you?
- I just have to know!
- Okay.
It was me.
- Of course it was!
The hunter represents your feelings of anger and abandonment that you've been running from ever since your parents' divorce.
Until now, you've been able to avoid those painful arrows, sometimes seeking refuge in the forest of repression.
Now, your willingness to identify the hunter signals that you are now ready to reintegrate these complex emotions into a more cohesive self!
Wow!
It's all so clear now.
It certainly is!
That was amazing.
I'm so glad I gave you a second chance.
- Oh, Marie, l - Please don't apologise.
Maybe someday it'll be some funny story we tell our grandkids, the time Grandpa broke up with Grandma.
- Actually, Grandma - Yes?
I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.
What?
- Us.
I'm afraid that - Wait a minute.
Am I crazy or are you breaking up with me again?
Well, they're not completely unrelated.
You see, you are a beautiful young woman and I have really enjoyed tackling some of these issues with you.
It's that I don't think that's the basis for a relationship.
You deserve someone who appreciates all you offer.
I don't believe this.
I feel more like your therapist than your boyfriend.
But I thought we were having such a good time together.
I'm afraid our time is up.
This weekend's game?
Well, yeah, I want them, Duke.
Seahawks-Chiefs, are you kidding?
I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Hey, wouldn't it be a kick if we wound up in-laws?
- Go to hell!
- Oh, hold on a sec.
Good, embrace the anger.
It's the best way to mental health.
I don't need health tips from you, you quack!
You made progress in the time we've been together.
Oh, don't flatter yourself!
- I have the name of a specialist.
- Call him yourself!
Hey, Duke, I'm gonna be kind of busy tomorrow.
Maybe you could just drop those tickets in the mail right now, so you don't forget.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I just had the most wonderful time today.
Me too.
It's funny, isn't it?
We worked together all that time, and we never dated before this.
- Well, anyway.
I was - Hey, Frasier.
- Nancy, hi.
- Roz.
- Hi.
- So are you back to work yet?
Almost.
I start at KNFS tomorrow.
So, Roz, Nancy and I are having coffee.
Oh, none for me, thanks.
Listen, can I have a fat-free muffin, please?
Nancy, I've been dying to call you.
My cousin just moved to town, and I think he'd be perfect for you.
Actually, I just started seeing someone.
Well, you'll forget all about him when you meet Chuck.
He is so handsome and rugged, and he loves the outdoors Kindly leave him there.
You see, the person that Nancy is seeing is me.
Really?
- You two are dating?
- Even as we speak.
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.
Oh, well, good for you.
I mean, who needs Chuck when you've got the?
Well, the anti-Chuck.
When my muffin gets here, could you send it over?
You won't even see it coming.
Well, where were we?
I think you were about to ask me out again.
Oh, my gosh.
So I was.
Well, let's just see how far this ESP of yours goes.
What night was I thinking of?
- Friday night.
- Astonishing!
Busboy, clear these spoons before she starts bending them.
Frasier, I'm so glad you're here.
- Niles.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Niles Crane.
I think we've met.
Nancy Cavanaugh.
I used to work at KACL.
- Oh, of course.
Talking business?
- Well, actually, no Oh, good.
I was afraid I was interrupting something.
Feast your eyes on this.
Financial settlement?
Good Lord, Niles, you and Maris have come to terms?
What was that?
I couldn't hear over the angels singing.
Well, congratulations.
Oh, that is exciting.
My brother's been going through a rather rancorous divorce.
- You must be very relieved.
- I'll say.
It's cost me a fortune already.
If she dragged it out any longer, I'd be literally bankrupt.
Well, I'm sure you've got some celebrating to do, so off you go.
I cannot wait until I am done with this.
I have to sign, get her to do the same, and then I can take my seat on the freedom train.
Well, all aboard!
It's a funny thing.
One day, you're starting a new relationship full of hope.
The next you're sinking helplessly into a sucking pit of despair.
Leaves you filled with the bitter bile of regret.
You're on a date, aren't you?
- It's hard to say at this point.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
I have to go anyway.
- It was nice seeing you again.
- Yes, you too.
- Frasier, I am so sor - What the hell is wrong with you?
Here we are.
- We're on for Friday night?
- Yes, of course we are.
You know, I was wondering, maybe we could just Have dinner at your place?
Well, yes.
That's amazing.
You read my mind again.
I thought it would be more comfortable.
We could curl up on the couch, make a nice fire Can you guess what I'm thinking now?
Oh, you are good, aren't you?
- Hey, guys.
- Hey there.
- Who won the squash game?
- It's not about winning or losing, - it's about the thrill of competition.
- Congratulations, Niles.
Thanks, Dad.
Pumped as I was, I don't think anybody could've beat me today, even an actual athlete.
- Sherry, Niles?
- Yes, thank you.
Maris and I have reached a financial settlement.
Oh, that's great!
This is wonderful.
Well, as wonderful as the tragic ripping apart of two lovers once bound in a sacred union can be.
- No, it's brilliant, Dr. Crane.
- Thanks, Daphne.
As long as you're doing the laundry, - let me throw in my gym towel.
- All right.
If you've got a couple of minutes, I can also give you these squash togs.
Oh, let's save some of the fun for tomorrow.
What's this?
Cartier?
- Niles, did you put this in there?
- No.
Somebody must have slipped it in my bag when we were at the court.
That's odd.
I don't remember anyone touching our things other than the valet and Jaime, the squash porter.
Boy, you boys really work up quite a sweat down there, don't you?
Oh, my goodness.
Niles, look at this.
Cuff links!
They're beautiful.
There's a card in here.
Let's see.
"I still think of you constantly.
I was wrong to ever let you go.
Do you believe in second chances"?
- It's unsigned.
- "Wrong to let you go".
It sounds like it's from someone who dumped you.
Well, that's no short list now, is it?
Maybe it's that Sonia woman he was going out with.
- Yeah, wasn't there a sister too?
- And a niece.
He went through that family like a recessive gene.
Yes, well Not to disrupt the think tank, but there is an easy way to find out.
I'll just make a few well-placed enquiries and see where I get a nibble.
Oh, yes.
There's a group of people that might regret having left Club Frasier before last call.
Oh, yeah, Patricia.
And there's, oh, Susan, yes.
Tatiana.
Oh, boy Frasier, all during squash the whole thing you talked about was this wonderful woman in your life.
You're gonna drop her to chase after someone else?
I'm not dropping Nancy.
I'm just - Weighing your options?
- Well, all right.
So, what if I am?
I don't believe this.
Niles, all of my life I have dreamt of the day when I would be pursued by more than one woman.
What man hasn't?
Do you blame me for enjoying it now that the day is here?
All my whole life I had to listen to you whine about your dating woes.
You have a chance for something good.
You're gonna risk it?
- You're jealous, that's what.
- I am not jealous.
- You're foolish.
- Come on.
Nonsense.
- Dad, don't you agree?
- Let's ask Dad.
What do you think?
Oh, no, don't drag me into this.
I learned when you were kids to stay out of it whenever you started fighting.
I'd just wait till the whole thing ended, usually in tears, and then I'd take you both out for ice cream.
That was my job, ice-cream man.
Yeah, I suppose fathers are the same everywhere.
Mine couldn't bear to see us fight.
If there was so much as a peep out of us, he'd be out the door to the pub, stay for a few hours, sometimes overnight.
When they brought him back the next morning, we couldn't fight because of his headaches.
I suppose that was part of his plan to keep harmony in the family.
God bless him.
Oh, Daphne, wait up.
I'll ride down with you.
Frasier, you have a chance for something real with Nancy.
Only a fool would throw that away chasing after some - It's here!
- Oh, oh, wait for me.
- Pie in the sky.
What an idiot.
Tatiana?
Frasier Crane calling.
Yes, pick up if you're there.
Well, I guess I've missed you.
The question is: Have you missed me?
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Roz.
- Why so glum?
- Why else?
The weekend's starting again, and I don't have a date.
Do you know how long it's been since?
You know.
I probably forgot how.
Oh, no, Roz.
I'm sure it'll come back to you.
It's just like riding a bicyclist.
Bicycle.
You're in the same boat.
Why don't you come over, hang out with me and Alice?
I'll rent a movie.
We can order pizza.
I'd love to.
Just, I've got a date with Nancy.
- That's still going on?
- Yes.
In fact, we're going out tonight on our third date.
You know the kind.
It's like one of your first dates.
- Well, I gotta go.
- All right.
You're Dr. Crane, right?
- Yes, I am.
Can I help you?
- A woman dropped this off for you.
Oh, my gosh.
It must be another gift from my secret admirer.
- You've got a secret admirer?
- Yes, I do.
In fact, the other day she sent me these cuff links.
At least, I think it's the same woman.
Unless a third person has thrown her hat into the ring.
Oh, my God.
You have two women?
- At least.
- And you're juggling them, and you're getting jewellery?
Why is that so hard to believe?
Well, I guess since they cloned that sheep, anything's possible.
- Hey, Roz.
Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Frasier.
- Dad, Niles.
- What is this?
Oh, not another gift from your mystery woman.
Yes.
Yes, indeed, it is.
Oh, my God.
It's a Patek Philippe pocket watch.
That is stunning!
I almost bought one like that on my honeymoon.
Only, Maris thought it was impractical so we got that glockenspiel instead.
So who do you think this stuff is from?
Gosh, I haven't smoked her out yet, but she certainly has exquisite taste.
Doesn't have a bad eye for jewellery either.
He was like this last night.
It was all I could do to keep my beer down.
Well, lookie there.
No, no, no, Dad.
That's Tina Dalton.
We dated last summer.
And now, it turns out she's in the café just as this little bauble arrives.
Coincidence?
I think not.
Frasier, before you go over there I've had enough of your finger-wagging.
I am doing what any red-blooded American man would.
There's nothing wrong with playing the field.
Looks like you've been eating the field.
What did you have for lunch?
Pesto.
Oh, my God.
All right, I better go freshen up.
Look at this mess.
You know, it's too bad it's not bubblewrap.
You don't know what funny is until you see Eddie go at a sheet of that stuff.
He gets all scared, runs away, and then screws up his courage and comes back again.
And he runs away again.
Yes, I watched him for an hour one time.
You know, it's amazing how entertained you can be by something so simple.
Oh, my What is it?
This card that came with the gift, Frasier must not have noticed it.
"Missing you every moment, my dear, sweet Niles".
- Do you realise what this means?
- Well, yeah.
You're the one with the secret admirer.
And a pretty nice watch too!
Well, I don't get this.
How could this happen?
Well, the other gift was left in Frasier's squash bag, which is exactly like mine.
And I guess today the waitress must've mistaken Frasier for me.
- You don't suppose it's Daphne.
- Yeah, she took the second job washing that old Mrs. Lumpkin's hair just so she could give you Cartier.
Besides, the note says it's someone you've been with.
There have been so few women since Maris.
There were so few women before Maris.
- Hence, there was Maris.
- I bet it is Maris.
You said you saw that watch on your honeymoon.
Oh, that's That's absurd.
Dad, we're in the process of finalizing a divorce Excuse me, miss?
Do you remember the woman who brought this box in?
Yeah, she was a very well-dressed and really, really thin.
Well, that could be a lot of people.
She just dropped off the gift and then ordered a whole-milk mocha with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
- Oh, thank God.
That's not her.
- Yeah, it was really weird, though.
She took a really long whiff of it, and then just handed it back.
Well, thank you, Marta, you've been very helpful.
Well, turns out Schenkman dropped Maris, - and now she wants me back again.
- Well, that was fun.
We had a little catching up to do, but it turns out she wasn't the woman sending gifts.
Yeah, we know.
The gifts are from Maris.
Maris is my secret admirer?
- No, she sent them to me.
- But they're?
Schenkman dumped her and she wants me back.
- How do you feel about this?
- Well, frankly, I feel a little injured.
I thought I had a secret admirer.
Well, no matter, I do have a date with Nancy tonight.
You know, it's our third date.
I was talking to Niles.
I guess I'll just have to go over and talk to Maris and set her straight.
I don't know if that's a very good idea.
Well, I'm up to my ears in debt.
I need her to sign this settlement.
She'll never do that if there's hope - of us getting together.
- It just seems dangerous to me, confronting her when she's so vulnerable, don't you agree?
Don't ask me.
I'm just the ice-cream man.
Thanks a lot.
Listen.
Niles, I think this whole pursuit of you has been brought on by a panicked reaction to Schenkman dumping her.
You know, give her a few days, she'll probably realise that herself.
- That's when you should approach.
- I can't wait.
Do you have any idea how insulting it is that she thinks she can buy me with trinkets?
I am this close to being free, financially and emotionally.
- I'm going to settle this right now.
- Niles, I just think you should wait.
Oh, God.
Well, he certainly dashed out of here in a hurry.
- I suppose that's a good thing though.
- Yeah, he's not gonna back down.
That, and he forgot these cuff links.
I've got a date tonight.
Oh, Daphne, thanks again for taking Dad over to Niles' for me.
I mean, I would do it myself, but since you are going out I'm going to a party three floors down from here.
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
I didn't mean for you to miss any of the fun.
Dad, shake a leg.
Daphne's in a hurry.
You know, I'm really glad he's going over there.
No idea what condition Niles will be in after Maris.
Yeah, it's a shame about Dr. And Mrs. Crane.
It seems so difficult these days to make something last.
To find someone to grow old with and share all of life's little details.
I only hope someday I'll find that kind of intimacy.
I'm sure you will, Daphne.
Daphne, where the hell is my scarf?
- In your sleeve where it always is.
- Oh, all right.
Come on, let's get going.
There's construction by the waterfront.
We're not going that way, we're taking my shortcut.
I know your shortcuts, and the waterfront's faster.
Now, don't start with me.
Don't you start with me, or I'll leave you here.
Oh, hi, how are you doing?
Come on in.
And we're turning on my radio station in the car.
Fine.
It's better than listening to you talk.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, no, that's a bad time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Boy, you look sensational.
- Thank you.
So do you.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Can I interest you in a glass of wine?
- Perfect.
- Lovely.
- I've been here before, you know.
Two years ago for your Christmas party.
- Really?
- I don't remember this chair.
Oh, well, normally there's something draped over it, my father.
Oh, there's a message on your machine.
Must've come in while I was cooking dinner.
I mention it because I gave my secretary your number so she can call about tomorrow morning's conference in case, you know, I don't find my way home tonight.
Oh, well, you just reverse the directions I gave you earlier Feel free to check the machine if you like.
I'll just go stir the risotto.
Frasier, this is Cheryl returning your call and no, I didn't send you anything.
I thought I told you when we broke up: It's over.
Boy, is that old message still on there?
Cheryl and I broke up so long ago, - I can't even remember when.
- Friday, 6:51 p.m. I know it was a Friday.
Oh, well, we all have exes.
As long as it's over.
It is over, right?
Oh, God, yes.
It certainly is over.
Oh, Nancy, please.
Here, come sit with me.
Listen, I want to tell you, I'm not interested in anyone but you.
Perhaps I better get that.
That could be your secretary.
Oh, let the machine get it.
Frasier, it's Denise.
I don't know how you got my number, but I'm not interested in dating you again.
Denise, you prankster!
No.
No, no.
I won't.
No, absolutely not.
I promise, never again.
Well, how about we have that dinner now?
I don't believe this.
You have been calling other women for dates.
- How could you lie?
- I didn't lie.
Why would I lie to you?
I have nothing to hide.
Oh, let me get that.
Hello?
Yes, l Oh, yes, just a moment.
It's your secretary.
Hi, Gwen.
Call me in the car in five minutes.
- I'm going home.
- No.
No, Nancy.
Nancy, please, please, please.
Oh, please don't be hasty.
I realise I've done something rather foolish.
Just let me explain.
Nancy, look, the truth is I did call some women.
I guess I was feeling insecure, a little nervous about getting close to you.
I don't blame you for being angry, and I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave.
It's just that I think we really have something here.
Well, I thought we had something too.
I made a mistake.
Give me another chance.
- Well, that risotto did smell good.
- Okay.
- Frasier.
- Oh, Madeline.
- I got that note you left under my door.
- I am so sorry about that.
I was so happy to hear from you.
Really?
I was just thinking about you the other day.
You know, I don't even remember why we stopped seeing each other.
What is go?
This again?
- Look, this date is over.
- Whoa, wait a minute.
You slipped a note under my door, and you're on a date with her?
Well, you heard her.
Technically, this date is over.
Don't ever call me again.
Or me, you freak!
Nancy, Madeline.
Please, give me a second chance.
Either one of you.
So then Daphne takes a left on Madison.
Bumper to bumper, all the way to Pike.
Then a right on Pike.
And what do you know?
Kingdome traffic.
So I say - Dear God, this is taking forever.
- Exactly.
And here we are on 5th Wait, wait, don't go away.
I'm coming.
Oh, Frasier.
I've had one of the worst experiences of my life.
You took Madison?
You're as bad as Daphne.
- What you should've done, for God - Oh, let it go!
Please come in.
How was your date?
Well, Nancy discovered that I had been pursuing other women.
- Well, how did she find that out?
- It wasn't hard.
You see, I pursued one during the date.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so am I, Fras.
Well, thanks, guys.
I just I should've listened to your advice, Niles.
- How did things go with Maris?
- I wish I knew.
I returned the gifts and told her there was no chance of reconciliation.
She didn't get mad.
In fact, she was eerily calm.
She just stood there with a blank stare on her face, rubbing her ocelot.
You know, they got a cream for that.
You know, maybe she'll come around.
You've given her a lot to digest.
- Oh, no.
- What is it?
- Oh, dear God.
- I don't believe it.
I I thought I made myself perfectly clear.
What is wrong with that woman?
Why don't you start, Fras?
I'll jump in when you get hoarse.
Roses are red Your heart is fickle When I'm through with you All you'll have left is this nickel Oh, no.
- Oh, God, she's going to ruin me.
- No, no, Niles.
You know, maybe she's just bluffing.
Once she's signed the financial settlement, it's She's not bluffing.
This is the financial settlement.
Oh, Frasier, why did I go over there?
Why didn't I listen to you?
And why didn't I listen to you?
If I had, I'd be sitting with Nancy right now, sipping wine in front of the fire.
I'll be stripped clean and devoured like an animal.
And I won't be.
All right, now.
Enough with these long faces.
Who wants ice cream?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Know where we should go tonight?
Frannie's Fish and Chips.
Dad, we're taking Niles out to boost his spirits, not his cholesterol.
Oh, please.
That French food you guys eat is full of butter and cheese.
But at least it's not prepared by a woman working a deep fryer in a batter-dipped brassiere.
- Hey, isn't that Niles?
- Where?
Driving that old hatchback.
No, Niles would never be seen in anything called a hatchback.
Although it does look a lot like him.
My God, he's running away.
Well, catch him, Mr. 12-Cylinder-German-Engineering.
- Hello?
- Niles, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm just pulling into my parking garage.
- You on your way?
- What are you talking about?
- You're driving up Second Avenue.
- You're in that little red thing.
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
See you when you get here.
He's getting away!
He just turned right at the corner.
- Hello?
- Niles?
What are you running for?
I can see that it's you.
No, you're mistaking me for someone else.
That is ridiculous.
I can hear my own horn through the phone.
Frasier, I may lose the connection.
I'm stepping onto my elevator.
I'll see you when you - What's the matter with him?
- Maris repossessed his car.
That must've been all he was able to afford.
He's just ashamed to admit it.
- Hello?
- Niles, do not hang up on me.
We know what's going on.
We're right behind you.
I was afraid this would happen.
I was petrified someone I knew would see me driving this humiliating car.
It looks like some buggy derailed from a carnival ride, except that this has no safety features.
Oh, Niles, you're worrying over nothing.
What kind of person judges you by the sort of car you drive?
- Mitzie Gill.
- Well, yes, she might.
- She drives a Bentley.
- She's parking on the corner.
She'll see me.
Everybody all right?
Dad, come quickly.
I need your help.
Oh, my God, what is it?
I need you to get up here and pretend this is your car.
My shoulder is killing me.
Good Lord, did you bang into the steering wheel?
No, I've been parallel parking all week without power steering.
- Let me get you some aspirin.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.
Check upstairs in the bathroom off the study.
Pardon the disarray, Frasier.
I've had to cut my cleaning lady down to two times a week.
Yeah, looks like a bomb went off.
I gather your financial situation's gotten a bit shaky.
Oh, yes.
Every since I rejected Maris' attempt to woo me back, she's been quite vindictive.
She's frozen all the accounts.
Sherry?
Thank you.
My salary isn't even covering my legal bills.
Well, what do your lawyers tell you?
Well, mostly that my salary isn't even covering my legal bills.
You know, Niles, if this siege is going to continue, you may have to tighten your belt a bit.
Perhaps we should make up a list of your expenses.
All right.
Here.
Thank you.
Oh, not with that pen.
No, that once belonged to Noel Coward.
- I just purchased it.
- It is stunning.
But if you're gonna be economizing, perhaps you'll have to forgo the decorative antique pens.
Could we at least review my list before we make any drastic decisions?
- Very well.
- That's my rent.
- That's insurance.
- You pay that much in rent?
Well, that includes the building newsletter.
It's outrageous.
- Niles, are you there?
- Yes, Dad.
Well, you can't blame me for the housing market.
This is a simple apartment.
I'm in some room with a lot of books, but it doesn't have a bathroom.
Oh, that's the library, not the study.
Go down the hall, make a left.
Yes, well, this simple apartment of yours is gonna bankrupt you.
You must admit it's a bit large for one person.
Well, don't forget I have a pet.
Are you telling me that your bird requires both a study and a library?
All right, I will return the Noel Coward pen, but this is my home.
This is a basic necessity.
Okay, I found the aspirin, but I'm lost again.
I'm in a blue room with big rolls of paper.
That's the gift-wrapping room.
Look for the stairs.
The only stairs I could find go up.
You have a third floor?
It's practically a crawlspace.
Go out the door to the left.
Don't look at me like that.
I have to have a roof over my head.
Niles, you have three roofs over your head.
For God's sake, come to your senses.
Look at the numbers.
They don't lie.
I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
All right, now I'm stumped.
How do I get down?
There's a bookcase blocking my way.
- The bookcase is a secret door, Dad.
- How do I open it?
- Poke Mrs. Dalloway on the bottom.
- What?
- The yellow book on the lower shelf.
- Oh, all right.
Frasier, ever since I was a little boy, I have walked by this building and wondered what sort of people could live in such a magnificent place.
I know, Niles.
Getting in here after Maris dumped me proved that I was not a complete failure.
I understand that.
And I have no choice, do I?
I'm sorry.
You know, perhaps you should move before you're obligated for another month's rent.
You can stay at my place until you find something.
Thank you.
Here you go.
You can get your own glass of water.
- This aspirin's expired.
- Well, it wasn't when I found it.
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'll clean up.
- Not necessary.
You've been cooking dinner every night.
I hardly feel like it's my kitchen anymore.
Of course it's your kitchen.
No, no, that doesn't go there.
I know it's probably a bit presumptuous of me to rearrange your kitchen for you, but I promise you, you'll find it a lot more user-friendly.
- Where's my jar of Bovril?
- No, I wasn't.
Oh, the meat paste.
Well, I threw it out.
It smelled rancid.
Well, that's how it's supposed to smell.
It's English.
Well, I'm off to bed.
Roz and I have a very important breakfast meeting with a potential employer tomorrow, and I can't be burning the midnight oil like you, Dad.
- Dad?
- What?
Oh, all right, I'll get a coaster.
No.
What's with you?
You could barely stay awake during dinner.
You'd be the same way if you shared a room with Niles.
All night long, up and down, shifting and tucking.
If it's really annoying you, I'll move his cot into my room.
At least one of us in this family could show him compassion.
Good luck.
Last night, I got up and went to the bathroom.
When I came back, he'd made my bed.
- Will you be much longer?
- Almost done.
I only ask because Roz and I have this important job interview tomorrow morning.
I'd like to be well-rested.
- You've been in there for 20 minutes.
- No, I haven't.
Now I have.
You should try this marvellous new facial peel.
It's like getting ten years back.
I'd settle for the last half hour.
This is gonna be so much fun.
Bunking together like when we were kids.
Oh, yes.
It's all coming back to me now.
I just want to tell you again how much I appreciate your taking me in like this.
Not every brother in your position would be so generous.
Think nothing of it, Niles.
You're no trouble at all.
Oh, dear, the sound of that rain's gonna keep me up all night.
I'm amazed you can hear it over there in Mission Control.
- Do you mind if I close the window?
- Not at all.
Much better.
Niles, what are you talking about?
That's just more rain noise.
No, it's much more than rain.
This is all of the sounds of the Brazilian rainforest.
- Does it bother you?
- No.
Just go to bed.
Oh, for God's sake, Niles!
All right, all right, I'll switch over to "Babbling Brook".
You know, if you're feeling tense about that interview, I could show you one of my breathing exercises.
No, no, just some sleep will do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, for God's sakes, Niles!
- What the hell happened?
- Isn't it obvious?
You blew a fuse.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I know he's on his way.
He must've gotten the address wrong.
I knew I should've picked a place he'd been to before.
- I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have to leave.
- Oh, please, don't leave.
- Let me just try his cell phone.
- Very well.
Hello, Frasier, it's Roz.
You sound terrible.
Where are you?
The emergency room?
Oh, my God!
His appendix burst.
No, no, no, no, don't apologize.
It's not your fault.
We'll just reschedule it.
I am so sorry I'm late.
My usual, please.
My phone, please.
Mr. Draper, you're not leaving, are you?
I have another meeting and I don't like to keep people waiting.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Roz, please, I'm so sorry.
- Where have you been?
- Blame Niles.
He kept me up late last night.
I slept right through my alarm.
What's he still doing there?
Hasn't he found a place?
No, he sublet his apartment at the Montana.
He has to find something furnished.
There aren't that many out there.
- Still, he's looking every day.
- Not yesterday.
What do you mean?
I saw him out in front of the Varsity waiting in line for Lawrence of Arabia.
That's impossible.
He told me he had appointments all day.
Frasier, I know Niles when I see him.
How many people go to the movies with their own seat cushion?
You mean, he hasn't even been looking?
I don't know.
Ask him yourself.
Niles.
- Frasier.
- Yes.
Off for another day of apartment hunting?
Yes.
Yes.
Only hope I see as many as I saw yesterday.
Covered the whole waterfront.
Oh, well, then you must have seen the one on Crawford and Pike.
- Yes, I think so.
- White with blue trim?
Right next to the market.
Couple of flags out front.
Yes, it looks nice from the outside.
It's completely unsuitable for living.
Oh, yes.
I'd imagine so, seeing as it's a Chevron station.
- What?
- You saw nothing.
Nothing yesterday, probably nothing in the last two weeks.
- You've been going to the movies.
- That is an outrageous lie.
Roz saw you and your seat cushion.
Here I was feeling sorry for you and you were lying to me the whole time.
I'm sorry.
After the first day, I just couldn't look anymore.
I'll never find anything tolerable in my price range.
It's barely tolerable having a price range.
All right, Niles.
Well, listen.
Today, I am going with you.
It may be the only way you ever find a place.
You sound as if I plan to stay with you forever.
Well, I did notice you put a bottle of '93 Pichon-Baron - on the grocery list last night.
- So?
That wine's not even drinkable for two years.
And we've got a rec room too.
Did you see the hot tub?
If you're referring to that six-man Petri dish, yes.
- I think we're about finished here.
- We can't leave without seeing it.
Frank was kind enough to put on pants and bring us up here.
Welcome to the Shangri-la.
Niles, it's magnificent.
I think you'll see why the Shangri-la is so popular with bachelors like yourself.
I had assumed it was that charming "No credit, no problem" banner out front.
Here's your kitchen, all modern.
It looks like the previous tenant left a four-slot toaster behind.
Isn't that something, Niles?
You can make yourself a club sandwich and still have a slice left for guests.
I think I've got the lay of the land.
No, wait, we haven't seen the bedroom yet.
Right this way.
Looks like he left the sheets behind.
Well, how's that for convenience?
No dust bunnies under that bed.
No, sirree.
That is a vacuumer's dream, that is.
Well, let's have a look at this closet space, shall we?
Oh, sorry, I thought Gary's sister was supposed to pick this stuff up.
Well, help yourself.
This Gary certainly seems to have left in a hurry.
Did he leave no forwarding address?
He left a note, but no.
No address.
Well, take your time.
- Now can we go?
- No, no, Niles.
Not before we've had a look at this very charming little ironing board here.
There you are, see?
You sure that's not the guest room?
Niles, listen, I know this isn't what you had in mind, but we have scoured the city.
I'm afraid this is the only thing we're gonna find.
Well, I wanna keep looking.
There's no rush.
- Well, actually - What?
Well, Niles You want me to move out.
I've overstayed my welcome.
I see.
No, it's time for you to understand that your circumstances have changed, and you're going to have to adapt.
I don't want to adapt.
I want to go home.
Niles, you are home.
Well, where are my manners?
Can I get you some toast?
Yes.
Well, I'm off.
Oh, your brother called.
He said he won't be joining you for the wine club tonight.
Really?
That's a first.
You know, it's funny how much Eddie misses that bird of Dr. Crane's.
This morning, a pigeon landed on the terrace.
Eddie jumped up, excited, ran over and started barking at it.
Yes, he does that all the time.
No, this was a different sort of bark.
Like, "You're not my bird.
Don't fly here and get me hopes up like that.
You're not my bird".
It was silly and sad at the same time, you know?
Firsthand.
- Did Niles say why he cancelled at all?
- No.
You know, I just hope he's not depressed.
I keep picturing him sitting in that dreadful apartment all alone.
Maybe I should've let him stay here longer until he found something nicer.
I'm sure once he gets his books on the shelf and his opera playing, he'll be fine.
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
Fras, your antique scout brought over that Noel Coward pen you bought.
Noel Coward pen?
Like the one your brother's got?
Oh, it is his.
He returned it and I pounced on it.
Dr. Crane's feeling bad about moving his brother out.
Oh, come on, Fras, he's a big boy.
You just gave him the push he needed.
Well, he did need a push.
Besides, I'm sure the place you found him isn't as bad as all that.
You're right, Daphne.
It isn't all that bad.
And once he's decorated it, it'll be much nicer.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm being much too hard on myself.
- He'll be happy at the Shangri-la.
- You got him in the Shangri-la?
That's where Duke stayed during his divorce.
Let me tell you, that's my kind of place.
What have I done?
Hey, Niles.
- Dad, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.
Did you not get my message about the wine club?
We thought it'd be fun to go out and have a meal.
Oh, well, actually, I'm on my way out.
Where to?
Bali-ha'i?
No, they're having a Ping-Pong tournament in the rumpus room and my neighbour Jimbo has invited me to be his partner.
Let me go and tell him that I'll be a couple minutes late.
If you're thirsty, they sent up some wine coolers in my welcome basket.
Hey.
And you were worried.
He's making friends, taking part in activities.
Dad, he's obviously covering.
That shirt alone is a shriek for help.
Is it so hard for you to believe that he could be happy?
In this place, yes.
You should stay.
The guys in D building are bringing over a 6-foot sub, and they've rigged the pinball machine so it's free play all night.
Niles, I'm finding it a bit difficult to accept this newfound enthusiasm of yours.
Weren't you the one who told me I should adjust to my circumstances?
I'm just concerned that you're immersing yourself in this lifestyle to avoid feeling the pain you're going Would you leave the guy alone?
No, he's obviously having a good time.
- I'm having a very good time.
- Why shouldn't he have a good time?
I'd be happy here myself.
This is my kind of place.
- Get me out of this hellhole.
- What did I say?
I can't live this charade.
I have tried.
It's taking too much out of me.
Now, Niles, this place is fine.
And you know what they say: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
But, Dad, not everyone makes it into that second group.
And I've got the luau shirt to prove it.
Okay, that's it, that's it.
Enough is enough.
Niles, who are you calling?
I'm calling Maris.
I'm going to beg her to take me back.
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yes, I do.
Life with Maris wasn't so bad.
It was my fault, after all.
I was too rigid.
I was always making demands.
- No, Niles.
- Eat something.
Unlock this door.
- Don't throw that.
- Niles, give me that phone.
- No.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Yes, I do.
- Drop it and kick it over here.
I won't.
I'm dialling.
I'm pressing send.
It's ringing.
Maris.
I'm calling I'm calling I'm calling to tell you that there is a new address for forwarding my mail.
It's 62 Elm Street, Shangri-la Apartments.
Thank you.
Well, good for you, Niles.
The second I heard her voice I knew I couldn't go back.
- But how am I ever going to live here?
- Now, it's just temporary, Niles.
She can't drag this divorce out forever.
You know, Niles, perhaps this place is the price you'll have to pay for your freedom.
Well, it's worth that.
Well, that's the way to look at it.
So let's have a toast to that.
Thank you, Dad.
You know, I never did sign my lease.
I suppose now is as good a time as any.
Niles, perhaps this will make it easier.
A little housewarming gift.
Thank you.
There we go.
Thanks, Dad.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Here's looking at you, kids.
You know, Niles, you may have to sleep here, but you don't have to eat here.
How does Cigare Volant sound?
Music to my ears.
I can't go in that place without a jacket.
Maybe we should paw through that closet.
I bet Gary's got a jacket that'll match those pants.
- Oh, here we are.
- Yeah!
Look at that.
That's great.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
What a glorious day.
Can't help but put a bounce in one's step, can it?
If you're gonna be cheerful, sit somewhere else.
- Damn it, I broke a nail.
- Here.
Here.
- Oh, hello, Niles.
- If my life gets any worse, I'm phoning hell to ask about their exchange program.
Well, lucky me.
I stumbled in at happy hour.
Here.
- So, Niles, Maris at it again?
- Oh, worse.
And it's so depressing I can barely talk about it.
My Gourmet Club is holding elections to see who will win this year's Golden Apron Wait, I can see I'm gonna need a hanky for this.
Latte, please.
To go.
Normally, the finalists compete by giving lectures.
I'd written mine.
A waggish look at food fads of yesteryear entitled: "Fondue: What Were We Thinking"?
Suddenly last night, disaster.
Someone proposed that instead of lecture, this year's finalists should compete by hosting dinner parties in their homes.
So why don't you invite them all over and cook them a meal?
At the Shangri-La?
I can't tell the cream of Seattle's gourmet set that I've moved out of the Montana and into that gulag with a game room.
- I'll just have to drop out of the race.
- Let's not be hasty.
Let's give this some thought.
- Every problem has a solution.
- Do you call that a problem?
A problem is when your kid keeps you up three nights in a row with colic, and you're so burnt out that you rear-end a Lexus with four passengers, each and every one a lawyer.
So you'll probably be sued and spend the rest of your working life, if you ever even get a job, lining the pockets of four blood-sucking, whiplash-faking fat cats.
That's what a problem is.
- Can you have it at a restaurant?
- It's against the rules.
- Thanks for the sympathy.
- Well, I - Sympathy for what?
- Oh, I don't know.
She broke a nail.
Anyway, Niles, try as I might, I can't think of a single thing.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't blame yourself.
You can blame Claudia Kynock.
The whole dinner scheme was her greedy notion.
- Claudia Kynock?
Kevin's widow?
- Can you believe it?
She owns six newspapers and nine radio stations.
She'll still cadge a free meal faster than that bulbous cartoon fellow who mooches hamburgers from Popeye.
- I know I must sound - Wimpy.
And whiny too, but I just I wanted this.
And after the year I've been through, I needed something to restore my pride, my dignity, my manhood.
That Golden Apron could do it.
And you are going to have it.
You can have the dinner party at my house.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
I'll rent an extra-large table, and share in the hosting chores.
You are a saint.
I did note you only offered after you found out our club includes a rich owner who could give you a job.
Well, Niles, I must say I'm hurt.
I offer out of the goodness of my heart, you make me sound like an opportunist.
I'm sorry.
How can I make it up to you?
Well, I don't know.
Seat me next to someone interesting.
- Oh, Claudia, perhaps.
- Yes, why not?
Put her on my left.
It's my best side.
He actually marked the bottle so he'd know if you took some?
Yeah.
Then he marched into my room and confronted me with the evidence.
I said, "All right, if you want to be such a miser, then fine.
I'll buy me own bath salts".
Oh, hi, Pam.
I didn't know you were here.
I told you this morning she was coming by.
Must have slipped my mind.
Well, don't you look nice tonight?
You too, Martin.
I love your sweater.
Yeah, pretty cheerful, huh?
You know, not everyone can wear these colours.
It helps if you're a matador.
Come on, we don't want to be late for the movie.
- Oh, can I freshen up first?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, right through there.
You dirty old man.
Flirting with a girl her age.
Well, she was flirting right back.
I saw her give me the once-over.
Yeah, she looked once and it was over.
You never acted this silly with any of me other girlfriends.
- What's so special about Pam?
- Oh, nothing.
She's just young and friendly, and she reminds me of the girls I used to date back during the war.
What, you mean Korea?
Mr. Crane, it's not dating when you're an occupying force.
Well, just ask her if she's interested.
Have you lost your mind?
Hey, the gals in Pyeongchang used to think I was pretty damn cute.
Yeah, well, this is a bit different.
You're not 21.
And her village hasn't just burned down.
You're not gonna get her with a kind smile and a Hershey bar.
Oh, just ask her, okay?
This explains that so-called mix-up with those mail-order videos.
Mistake, my fanny.
You ordered The Joy Luck Club.
- Oh, hi, Dad, Daphne.
- Hey, you guys.
- Pam, nice to see you.
- Hi.
Hello, Niles.
- All right, we're off.
Good night.
- Good night.
Pam, an-nyong-hi kye-se-yo.
Just keep moving.
- What's with Dad?
- It's a Korea thing.
Don't ask.
Oh, my gosh.
He said yes.
I've got him.
That was a message from Marcel DuBoeuf.
He's agreed to cater my dinner for the club.
- Oh, Niles, that is a coup.
- Who?
Marcel DuBoeuf, Dad.
He's the famous sculptor turned chef.
Each plate is a work of art.
He's doing his all-truffle menu.
For the appetizer he sculpts tiny mushroom trees, then he carves radishes to look like truffle pigs snuffling around the roots.
Maybe I should do that for Eddie.
I could mould his Alpo into a cow.
- That reminds me - I got him Sonics tickets.
Bless you.
And did I mention they are predicting meteor showers for that evening?
So not only will I have a great meal - in a perfect setting - Niles.
- But I'll have nature itself putting on a show for us.
Oh, we'll have an excellent view from right - Dear God, what's that?
- It's a small crack.
A little bird flew into it the other day.
I'm replacing the pane next week.
Next week?
That's too late.
It's a piece of tape.
No one will notice.
Well, you have no idea how cutthroat my rivals are.
They will leap on the tiniest imperfection.
Last night, Sebastian Melmoth threw a lavish Japanese banquet.
A certain rival spent the entire evening carping about how the obis on the geishas' kimonos were improperly tied.
- A certain rival?
- All right, me.
He had geishas?
That's enough, Dad.
Well, I'll just have to have the party somewhere else.
But, Niles, you promised you'd have it here.
- You promised me Claudia Kynock.
- Nobody's gonna notice.
Besides, who else is gonna loan you their place?
It's not like you can ask Maris.
I don't have to ask her.
She's out of the country.
She's in Antwerp having her elbows done.
She has that stunning beach house.
- I can get past the alarm.
- Isn't that breaking and entering?
Oh, pish.
It can't be a crime if it's catered.
- I hope you have a lovely time.
- Don't sulk.
You can still come.
I've gotta start planning.
Wait until you see this place.
It's right on the beach.
It's ideal for viewing the meteor shower.
Maybe Chef Marcel can make your truffles look like little meteors zooming around the plate.
We make fun of him, but every now and then he has a fantastic idea.
I hope you're right about the alarm code.
- People do change them.
- Maris will never change this one.
It's her ideal weight.
What she weighed at her debutante ball.
Let's see, this many pounds and that many ounces.
Good Lord, no one could weigh that and live.
Maris!
- Oh, no, not her.
- Neighbour?
Yes.
Gretchen Koontz.
The old girl has been smitten with Maris ever since she taught falconry at Maris' finishing school.
Now, here, put these in water.
I'll get rid of her.
Maris, liebchen, is that you?
- Oh, Dr. Crane.
- Hello, Gretchen.
I'm surprised to see you here.
When last I spoke to Maris, she said your marriage had come to a timely end.
Yes, well, it's all patched up now.
We couldn't be happier.
In fact, that's Maris in the kitchen now.
We're terribly busy.
I'll be right with you, muffin.
- But I'll tell her you looked in.
- Do.
Ask her to stop by.
My wolfhound had puppies.
- Let's get some lights on.
- Yes.
- Good Lord, what the hell is that?
- What?
Oh, Maris had it made after she lost power in a storm.
Battery operated.
It works on a clapper.
So you can find it in the dark.
Only problem was, try as she might, the poor thing could never clap hard enough to activate it.
Oh, Niles, this view is breathtaking.
With a setting like this and Chef Marcel in the kitchen, I think that Golden Apron is as good as yours.
What is that revolting smell?
It smells like it's coming from the beach.
It's like garbage or rotting fish or - Or a dead seal.
- No, it's more like a rendering plant.
No, Niles.
There's an extremely large dead seal right by this dinghy.
Oh, dear God!
You know, on the bright side, there's not a single crack in these windows.
Yes, animal control?
A large seal washed up on my property.
I need you to come and remove it right away.
Its condition?
It's deceased.
And might I add, pretty damn pungent, so if you'll just get over What?
What?
Well, you're not serious.
He says they only handle live seals.
What kind of policy is that?
Well, if it were alive, I wouldn't need you.
I could just scare it away myself.
I'd pay to see that.
Oh, wait.
I was mistaken.
It's not dead after all.
It's sitting up.
It looks very disoriented.
Come quickly.
Give me that.
Give it.
Hello, this is Frasier Crane.
You may remember me from my radio show.
Oh, yes, that should send the seal mobile racing over here.
And just how do you suggest that we dispose of a dead seal?
I see.
I see.
Charming.
Well, we have two options.
We can either bury it or haul it out to sea, in which case he suggests that we stab some holes into it.
Stab holes in it?
To make it less buoyant.
It would certainly make me less buoyant.
Well, we'll have to bury it.
- Help me find a shovel.
- Right.
Oh, no, that's Chef Marcel.
If he finds out what's out there, - he will walk.
- Over a dead seal?
He won't let anything upstage his food.
He stormed out of Kate York's christening party over an ill-timed diaper change.
- Look, you let him in.
- Right.
- I'll find a shovel.
- Okay.
Chef Marcel, this is indeed an honour.
I'm Frasier, Niles' brother.
Where is my kitchen?
It's right through there.
- What is that smell?
- What smell?
Is there a baby here?
No.
I mean, yes.
Well, there was a baby, but it's gone now.
- And we can air the place out.
- Do.
All right, let's do this.
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
What's the matter, Niles, you couldn't find any demitasse spoons?
I'm sorry.
This is all we have.
It'll take us until doomsday with these things.
Let's stick it into the dinghy and haul it out to sea.
Come on.
I'm not touching that with my bare hands.
All right, just go get a sheet or something to wrap it in.
Poor noble creature.
At least in death, you've achieved a kind of tragic dignity.
We can wrap it in this.
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.
- A peach peignoir?
Yes, and I found perfume.
We're giving it a burial, Niles, not a day of beauty.
It's to cover the smell.
And the peignoir was all I could find.
The beds are all stripped.
- The linen cupboard's locked.
- All right, just get on with it.
- Do you think that helped?
- Oh, yes, Niles.
It smells so lovely now it's almost a shame to bury it.
- Will you give me a hand with this?
- Yes, all right.
There.
Okay, now let's turn it over.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Have you ever seen anything so heartbreaking?
That sullied nightgown, that cold vacant stare, those limp little whiskers.
Stick a corncob pipe in its mouth, it could be Nana on Dad's side.
Come on, let's go.
Move.
Nice oarsmanship, Mr. Oxford-Rowing-Champ.
It's not very easy to keep your balance when your crewmate jumps on your back and shrieks like a tea kettle.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The thing's tongue lolled out and licked my ankle.
I just hope the wind changes direction before the party.
- Yes.
- They'll be here in 15 minutes.
The stench is so strong I could almost swear the damn thing was still - It's back!
- Oh, my God.
Tide must have washed it back in.
We should've taken their advice and stabbed holes in it.
No, I refuse to even contemplate something so disgusting.
We'll just row it back out, this time we'll weigh it down with something.
Oh, Niles, what about that hideous anchor lamp?
Perfect.
We'll tie it with the peignoir sash.
It'll sink like a brick.
Would you mind terribly doing that alone?
- Alone?
- Yes, I have to get ready.
Frasier, please, I beg you.
All right, Niles.
But the entire time I'm gone, sing my praises to Claudia Kynock.
- Done.
- Excuse me, where do you keep?
Chef Marcel, it's so nice to meet you at last.
You have been swimming?
Just a dip.
In your clothes?
Well, it is November.
You know, it was so refreshing, I think I'll go back for another.
- Don't forget your lamp.
- Oh, yes, thank you.
It's getting dark in that water.
Now, Sebastian, you must try one of these truffled scallops.
I'm allergic to bivalves.
A good host would know that.
Don't mind Sebastian.
He's just afraid you'll outshine his geisha party.
Now, now, no rivalries.
We're all friends tonight.
I'm sorry about the scallops.
In the future, I'll try to cater more to your shellfish demands.
I got that.
Thank God you're back.
I can open the deck?
- People are suspicious.
- I hauled it as far as I could.
I hope that lamp was heavy enough.
- Is Claudia here?
- She's dying to talk to you.
- Good.
Smell my fingers.
- Lovely, tuberose?
- Jasmine.
- Really?
Everyone, as you may know, I have arranged a small meteor shower for our entertainment this evening.
So feel free to claim your spots now on the observation deck.
Please, go right ahead.
Sebastian, enjoy it.
Claudia, this is my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Well, just the man I wanted to meet.
- Really?
Well, now I should warn you, Claudia's in radio so you're in for more of that arm-twisting you've been getting from the other station owners.
Oh, my brother, the publicist.
Before long, he'll be telling you about my two SeaBees and my Broadcaster of the Year Award.
Well, now we don't have to talk all business.
But I do wanna mention that we may be replacing one of our nationally syndicated hosts, the Happy Traveller.
Oh, yes, the Happy Traveller.
How's that coming?
Not well.
Unless they get more realistic with those ransom demands, he's never coming out of that jungle.
There certainly are a lot of gnats buzzing about out here.
- Yes, there are.
- Allow me.
Oh, dear God.
- It's only a gnat, Niles.
- Yes, well, gnats carry disease.
- Oh, you missed it.
- There's another.
There were no bugs at my party.
What's that on the beach?
I don't know, but it's wearing a boa.
No, no, no, that's preposterous.
It's just a rock with some seaweed on it.
Niles, there seems to be something with feathers flashing at us.
Yes, yes, that's my neighbour.
Don't clap, it just encourages her.
Does anyone else smell something?
I know what I smell.
Truffles.
- Everyone, time for dinner.
- Yes, yes, please, step lively.
Truffles.
All right, all right, get out there and stab that thing.
No.
I'm sick to death of chaperoning that carcass.
Well, I can't do it.
I'm the host.
Because of that woman in there and a scrappy band of third-world rebels, I am this close to getting a national radio show of my own.
- You have to do it.
- All right.
Get me a knife, close those curtains.
Don't let anyone out on this deck - until I come back.
- Fine.
Where's the damn thing gone to?
Got it.
Thanks.
I've listened to your show, and what impressed me most is your ability to focus.
Yes, I'm very proud of that.
I give each of my callers my complete undivided Excuse me.
Would you please just stay inside?
- We're about to start dinner.
- Well, you said that ten minutes ago.
Yes, so it's even truer now, isn't it?
Just sit down.
I'm sorry.
Back to my show.
I must say, I was wondering myself when we'd be eating.
It's getting late.
Well, Niles is in the kitchen right now trying to prod Chef Marcel along.
You know how it is with these perfectionists.
- I am waiting to serve.
Where's Niles?
- You mean he's not with you?
Well, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
You know, perhaps he's upstairs making a phone call.
If you just keep everything warm, he'll be down in a minute.
He better be.
I reheat for no one.
I'm terribly sorry about all these interruptions.
Now, can we just get back to that job?
Well, you'd be in 93 markets Excuse me.
Can I help you?
- I just saw a meteor.
- Oh, have they started?
Oh, splendid.
Everyone, please stand back.
And witness the spectacular view through this transom.
Can't we see them better from outside?
No, it's much safer in here.
You never know where they might land.
Perhaps that's Niles.
Hello, is Niles Crane here?
We're investigating a possible homicide.
What?
Your neighbour saw Dr. Crane and another man row out to sea with a third party dressed in a nightie.
The men returned alone.
We suspect they dumped the body overboard.
All right, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
Please, gentlemen, come in.
I can clear this whole thing up.
I was the other man in the row boat.
- You dumped a body overboard?
- Thank God you're here.
- I just saw a murder.
- What?
Dr. Crane was on the beach with his wife, Maris.
I recognized her peignoir.
I could even smell her perfume.
- He was stabbing her again and again.
- No, no, no.
Clearly, this woman is delusional.
Listen, search the entire house.
I defy you to find one scrap of evidence that there's been foul play here.
My butcher knife has disappeared from the kitchen.
Go check the beach.
Please, people, I assure you, there is nothing sinister going on here.
Hello, all.
Meteor shower's started.
Oh, excuse me.
Niles, there's been a little misunderstanding.
Perhaps it's time you explained about the dead seal we found.
A dead seal?
At my Golden Apron dinner?
That's enough bubbly for you.
But, Niles, they think you murdered Maris.
I saw him stabbing her.
Oh, I see what happened.
Oh, this is funny.
Oh, you're all going to laugh when you hear this.
I was simply stabbing a seal.
You killed a seal?
No, no, I didn't kill it.
It was already dead when we found it.
- You found a dead seal?
- Yes.
And it was wearing a peignoir?
That is ludicrous.
We put the peignoir on it.
- And the perfume too?
- Yes, of course.
So you found a dead seal, dressed it in a peignoir, doused it in perfume, then stabbed it.
I told you you'd laugh.
I found this washed up on the beach.
Oh, well, there, if that doesn't prove my innocence, I don't know what does.
It's covered in her blood.
Dinner is served.
Sorry, folks, no one can leave.
This is a crime scene.
Well, it certainly would be a crime if we missed that dinner.
Everyone, sit down.
There's place cards all around the table.
- Okay, gentlemen, let's go.
- Well, he said no one could leave.
Claudia, perhaps we can discuss that job tomorrow.
I've got business cards in my breast pocket if you'd like to fish one out.
No?
Fine.
I'll just call you then.
Officer, you can't arrest me.
My wife is alive.
She's in Antwerp having her elbows done.
Give it up, Niles.
Even I didn't believe that one.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
A gold-leaf candle snuffer?
My, what a spendthrift this Charles X was.
Of course I want you to bid on it for me, Greg.
Now, start waving your paddle.
- Hey.
- Oh, Roz, you got my message.
Yeah, said you had good news.
- Yes.
- What's up?
More importantly, what's down.
Oh, fun.
Word play.
No, no, no, the ratings are out for KACL's first six months of All Salsa Radio.
- And they were lousy?
- They aspire to lousy.
So they'll be looking for a new format.
- Better yet, an old format.
- Think they're gonna bring us back?
- That's the scuttlebutt on the street.
- Oh, this is great.
Aren't you thrilled?
I'd be shouting it from the rooftops if I weren't saving my instrument.
- Oh, thank you.
- May I help you?
Non-fat cap.
I haven't seen you before.
- I'm Roz.
This is Frasier.
- Colette.
Your mother was a fan of the great French novelist and raconteur, Sidonie Gabrielle Colette.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, guys, you won't Any more like you at home?
- No.
- Good, we'll have privacy.
- Short drip.
- Colette.
- Hey, you guys see these numbers?
- Yes.
- Salsa Radio is in el dumper-acha.
- See?
KACL is gonna be on their knees begging us to come back to work.
You know that lady from the temp agency who's saying I have a bad attitude?
I can't wait to tell that bean-counting fathead where she can put her time sheet.
I'm quitting on the way home.
What?
Did you say something?
No, no, never mind.
I better cancel my lecture next week.
Can't be out of town if I'm gonna work.
- No, no - Is everything all right, Colette?
- Oh, I hate this.
- What?
Well, I overhear things.
I'm not trying to.
It just happens when you're a waitress.
And you overheard something about KACL?
They're not dropping Salsa.
- What?
- How do you know that?
Well, the station owner was in this morning, and he said: "It's my station.
I like salsa music, and I'm sticking with it".
But that could mean anything.
I knew I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
This stinks!
This is total B.S.!
Oh, what are you so upset about, Bulldog?
You've got a job.
Not anymore.
I got canned last Friday for saying something on the air.
I was talking with this golfer chick who said she wants to enter the Women's Open.
Like I'm supposed to leave that alone.
I'm starting to think we're never going back to work.
They can't stay with a failing format forever.
I guarantee you, in three months, if the numbers are this bad, they'll have to make a change.
Three months is an eternity.
My rent's gone up.
The baby stuff cost a fortune.
I stopped buying Alice those pink headbands for little girls whose hair hasn't come in yet.
Now, when we go out, I just call her Howard.
Well, Roz, you know what, if things have gotten that tight, let me lend you some money to tide you over.
- Oh, that's very sweet, but I couldn't.
- No, please.
It's not a hardship for me.
I'll be fine for the next three months.
I don't know.
I'm not sure I feel comfortable taking money from you.
Try putting your hair in a bun.
That used to help Lilith.
Now, how much can I give you?
Fifteen hundred?
- I mean, I wouldn't ask for so much - No, no, none of my business.
You can just pay me back whenever you'd like.
This is your money to do with as you see fit.
There we are.
Thank you.
Oh, Roz, please, don't even mention it.
Makes me feel good to share my good fortune with someone.
I just got a call from my antique scout.
He's found a gilded candle snuffer that the Seattle Museum would pay a pretty penny for to have in their collection.
I hate her.
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.
I have no idea where it is.
- I'm not even sure I own one.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Dad, have you seen Frasier's frittata pan?
Hi.
Marty Crane.
I don't believe we've met.
Dad, what on earth are you doing?
Oh, Eddie's woozy.
There's this vicious blue jay on the terrace who keeps teasing him.
Then Eddie goes chasing after him and slams into that glass door.
And this bird just struts around, big as you please, laughing that snooty bird laugh.
Snooty bird laugh?
Yeah, like that.
I wanna put stickums on the door so that Eddie remembers it's glass.
Oh, yes, Dad, by all means.
Let's add rainbow decals to the nose prints and the bits of fur that already festoon it.
You're kind of grouchy for somebody who just got his job back.
Well, maybe that's because I'm not getting my job back.
What happened?
You said it was a sure thing.
Well, it wasn't.
I spoke with Bebe.
She confirmed that they're keeping Salsa.
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, well, don't despair, Dad.
There are other jobs.
Bebe told me that I'm on the short list for the voice of Chester "the Yummy Nut" Squirrel.
All right, don't anyone go out in this weather.
I am so soaked, my dress is pasted right onto me.
It's a good thing I had this coat in the trunk.
Yes, that was lucky.
Let me take it for you.
No, it's all right.
I'll keep it on for the moment.
Thanks.
Here you are, Dr. Crane.
I stopped off at the Trianon Day Spa and picked up your papaya exfoliant - and neck cream pour L' Homme.
- Thanks, Daphne.
I wouldn't have sent you out in this weather if it weren't an emergency.
Oh, by the way, I saw Roz down at the spa, having herself an all-day beauty treatment.
Now, that's strange.
Why?
Well, Roz has been a little cash-poor lately.
In fact, I gave her a loan myself this morning.
Then she heads down to the Trianon.
I have half a mind to have a word with her about it.
Bad idea.
If you loaned her that money, it's hers now.
It's none of your business what she does with it.
- That's exactly what I told her.
Still - Trust me.
More friendships have been ruined because of something like this.
Smartest thing you can do is never bring it up.
Well, I'm aware of that, Dad.
It's just that she must have gone straight from the cafe down to the spa.
Don't you think that's odd?
Well, not when you stack it up against a man who uses neck cream.
Before you mock this product, you might recall you went to that spa.
- What?
- Don't you remember?
Two years ago, for your birthday, I gave you that special gift certificate for you and Sherry to have a day of indulgence.
You told me you used it.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Remind us, Dad, what treatments did you have?
Oh, we did the whole shooting match.
First they rubbed us all over, and then they washed us down with this liniment oil.
And then they hit us with those hickory sticks.
You've heard us talk about it enough, you'd be able to bluff better than that.
You'd be surprised at what I don't listen to.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I hope you're not mad.
Mad?
No, I'm delighted.
If you still have the certificate, we can go together.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, please, I need this.
You know, a spa's just not my speed.
I just keep picturing myself standing over some drain being hosed down like some old circus animal.
But, Dad, I can't afford this sort of thing for myself anymore.
I'd go without you, but the certificate's in your name.
- Please?
- Oh, all right.
Oh, great.
I'm gonna call and make a reservation before you change your mind.
And what are you smirking at?
Oh, I'm just musing about the timeless moments that bind a father to son.
A game of catch, a trip to a little fishing hole, a shared rainforest mud facial.
Oh, Niles, I thought today was your spa day.
It is.
I'm on my way, and I need it now more than ever.
Last night at the Shangri-La, - the most scandalous thing happened.
- Now's not the best time.
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.
I'll have A non-fat cappuccino?
Good guess.
No, I've waited on you before.
Oh, I don't think so.
I'm very observant.
Anyway I was invited to a housewarming party for a new arrival, Stewey.
I hadn't been there two minutes when I heard a pop.
Looked up to see the '81 Chateau Haut-Brion I brought being decanted into a punch bowl of sangria, canned fruit and erotic ice cubes.
I haven't been so depressed since Maris started seeing - What's-His-Name.
- Schenkman.
Thank you.
Hey, guys.
- Oh, Roz.
- Hello, Roz.
Shopping really takes it out of you.
Really?
Stocking up on supplies for baby Alice?
Oh, no.
It's mama's turn today.
I'll be back in a minute.
Bidwell's?
My God, isn't that a little pricey?
I'll say.
It's Maris' favourite store.
They give points for every dollar you spend there.
One year, she got enough to have Tony Bennett come to our house and sing.
Well, at this rate she's gonna go through that loan in no time.
I'm just wondering if I should have a talk with her.
I understand your impulse, but I'm with Dad on this one.
Questioning her about that money, - it's just going to lead to trouble.
- I'm not sure I agree.
Of course, the entire point may be moot anyway.
How do I know there's anything more extravagant in here - than calendars and socks?
- Don't even think about it.
You know as well as I do there is absolutely no justification for going through her bags.
You're right, there isn't.
- Now there is.
- Frasier.
Just shut up and keep a lookout.
God, a cashmere sweater.
Bidwell's private labelled perfume.
- Here she comes.
- What, oh, my keys.
That is the last time I wear the shoes right out of the store.
My feet are killing me.
I should go.
I wanna get down to the spa before Dad.
He may bridle when the front desk clerk asks him if he prefers a man or a woman.
Is that the time?
I gotta meet Carol for lunch at La Goloue.
- La Goloue?
- Yeah.
- Roz, before you go, there's - Oh, I know.
If I drop your name, they'll give me better service.
I'll call you later.
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yes, a taxi.
I already called.
Oh, damn.
Oh, not to worry, Dr. Crane.
- I'll have that spot cleaned up.
- Thank you, Daphne.
Lock up your daughters.
The men are back from the hunt.
Oh, well, boys, how was your day at the spa?
Fantastic.
You should have seen Dad.
I walked by the serenity room just as Olga and Sergei were giving him a full-body sudsing.
I never felt so clean and so dirty at the same time.
See you later, Dad.
Great day.
- All right, how bad was it?
- Mortifying.
First of all, he refused to go nude, even in the private rooms.
Well, Niles, don't forget, Dad is of a different generation.
Wearing socks and underpants and carrying a wallet into a mudbath is not a generational issue.
If you ever hear me offer to take Dad to a spa again, wash out my mouth with jug wine.
Did you ever get your keys back from Roz?
No, no.
Actually, I had to wait the entire day before she found them in her bag.
She's on her way over here right now.
It gives me a chance to talk to her about her spending.
Frasier, why do you insist on traipsing into that minefield?
Niles, I don't want to talk to her about it, I have to.
For God's sake, at the rate she's spending, she's gonna be out of money before we're back to work.
And frankly, I'm just a bit annoyed with the way she flaunts it in my face.
Expensive lunches.
Needless extravagances.
Frankly, I think the entire thing's just a bit insensitive, don't you?
Oh, excuse me.
Not to interrupt, but six months ago, you borrowed $40 from me.
We were at the wine shop, remember?
You couldn't quite scrape together enough for a bottle of your precious Chateau Mr. Fussy-Pants.
So I lent you the money.
And have I said a peep about it since?
No.
I just sit here, quietly reusing my tea bags, while you trundle off to your private clubs ordering gourmet this and imported that.
"Are the cigars Cuban?
Are the tulips Dutch?
Oh, good news.
My personal shopper just found a dozen antique pudding plates".
Who has 12 people over for pudding?
So you gave poor Roz a bit of money.
It hasn't changed your life, has it, you sherry-swilling, foie-gras-munching hypocrite?
Daphne, I did repay you.
What?
I paid for that parking ticket.
Fifty dollars, as I recall.
That means you owe me 10.
Oh, right.
Well, I'm glad you said something.
It's not good to let these things fester.
Niles, I think I'm having a weird reaction to that spa stuff.
My skin's starting to tingle and tighten up.
That's the citrus reacting with your natural oils.
It's a good sign.
Well, it doesn't feel so good.
I just scratched my chin and my eyelid closed.
Oh, that'll be Roz.
Maybe I'll take my leave before the fur starts to fly.
Oh, Niles, there's not gonna be any fur flying.
Unless, of course, she bought one on the way over here.
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Niles.
- Roz.
- Are you on your way out?
Yes.
Good night.
- Well, here are your keys.
- Oh, thank you, Roz.
We had to turn the whole cafe inside out looking for them.
I would've been here a lot sooner, but I stopped to get you something.
Roz, oh, gosh, you know, you really shouldn't have.
I wanted to.
This is just my way of saying thank you for how great you've been.
Well, you see, you really shouldn't have.
I mean, for one thing, it's just Gosh, it is lovely, Roz.
It's just that There's something I need to talk to you about.
No, that decanter is not just to say thank you.
It's also to say congratulations.
Station manager called me half an hour ago.
I made him promise he'd let me tell you.
The board has reconsidered.
They're changing formats.
- They're bringing us back!
- Oh, Roz, that's fantastic!
We start tomorrow.
What's going on?
Good news, Dad, good news.
We got our jobs back at KACL.
Oh, great.
Congratulations.
Well, I thought we'd at least get a smile out of you.
I thought I was smiling.
This is so great!
We're all back together again!
Hey, Noel, good to see you.
What have you been up to?
Well, actually, I never left.
Adios, Maria.
Hi, everybody!
Roz!
- Oh, God.
- Isn't this the best?
It's so great to see everyone.
Bulldog and Noel, Frasier, you.
God, I didn't think I'd ever see this place again.
It's like we're soldiers coming back from the war.
I'm home!
Well, you know, as much as I'd like to continue the celebration, in three minutes, we have a show.
Come on, Roz, let's go!
Oh, God.
Noel?
Oh, I just wanted to say I missed you most of all, Roz.
Oh, well, thanks, Noel.
That's so sweet.
Yes, that certainly is sweet, Noel.
Off you go.
Me?
Nothing much has changed.
Still living with my mom, still working on that Klingon-to-English dictionary.
Noel, how do you say goodbye in Klingon?
Well, it depends.
If you're talking to a superior officer - Noel!
- Krish-Krush.
I am so thrilled to be back.
Oh, God, so am I, Roz.
You know what?
I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night.
I put the time to good use.
I composed a speech to open the show.
Oh, that's great.
You know, as I was falling asleep last night, it occurred to me that you wanted to talk to me about something.
Right.
Right.
Oh, well, you know, I just had a little bone to pick with you.
But it's gone by the wayside now.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, absolutely.
You know how things are when you're out of work.
You just get a little crazy about little stuff.
Oh, tell me about it.
I mean, the money stuff alone - Well, as a matter of fact - What?
No, no, no, it's just not an issue anymore, Roz.
Now, come on.
Well, all right, it's just that I thought the way you were spending money was a little unwise.
You know, spa days, expensive lunches, Bidwell's perfume.
I just thought, you know, you were unemployed.
But, you know what?
You're employed now, so there it is.
End of subject.
I won't even bring it up again.
I never told you I bought that perfume.
Well, I You didn't have to.
I can smell it on you.
I'm not wearing any.
You're kidding.
My goodness, is that you?
Well, then, you should sweat into bottles.
We got a show to do.
The only way you could know that is if you were looking through my shopping bag The keys.
- Roz, we really should be setting up.
- I can't believe this.
You were searching through my bags?
What, is this about the loan?
All right, fine.
I gave you $1500 and suddenly, you were off on a spending spree.
Excuse me, but weren't you the one that said I could spend it any way I wanted?
I just thought you were gonna be more responsible.
Oh, so now I'm irresponsible.
No, no, I'm just saying that a woman in your situation What situation?
Oh, I know what this is all about.
- My baby.
- Roz - That's what this irresponsible stuff - No, that is not what I meant!
Well, listen, obviously, I am not to be trusted with your precious money, so I'm paying you back.
And not that it's any of your business, but Carol took me out to La Galoue.
And my mother gave me a day at the spa.
And those shoes were a store credit.
Oh, and I bought the perfume.
Well, that was just for me because I wanted it.
Roz, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say any of those things.
- Too late.
- I can't stand to have you mad at me.
Look, let me take you to dinner tonight.
We can discuss it after work, all right?
- You're on.
- Thank you.
No, you're on in five seconds.
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, and we're back.
But don't worry.
I may have been gone a while, but I think I can remember how all these knobs and buttons work.
I see they've moved the cough button.
Well, anyway, I composed some thoughts last night about what the show has meant to me these last years and, well, I'd like to share it with you now.
I realised I have a lot to feel grateful for.
Grateful for my listeners who trusted me with their problems.
And grateful for the person whom I most trust.
It's not an exaggeration to say I put my career in this woman's hands every day and she never lets me down.
She shoulders many responsibilities here and in her personal life with a grace and skill that I admire more than she'll ever know.
I am proud to call her my friend.
My producer, Roz Doyle.
Well, now, on to the show.
And if I'm a bit rusty, I hope you'll forgive me.
After all, to err is human.
- I hope you'll look into your hearts - All right, Frasier, you're forgiven.
Oh, good.
All right.
Well, we've got a quick word from our sponsor and then we'll be back with your calls.
Back after this.
Thanks, Frasier.
- I'm sorry I got so mad.
- Oh, Roz, you had every right to.
How can I think you would squander the money I gave you that way?
- You'd never be that irresponsible.
- Well, I wouldn't.
If it was on your mind, I'm glad you brought it up.
I like that we can be honest with each other.
I like that too.
And I'm so touched that you stayed up all night last night and wrote all those things about me.
I meant every word.
Hey, Dr. Crane, great speech.
- I loved what you said about Roz.
- Oh, thank you, Noel.
Hey, Bulldog, can you lend me some money?
- Sure.
How much?
- Fifteen hundred.
I wrote a bad cheque.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's nothing in here about Roz.
Noel, put that down.
"Like Napoleon's triumphant return from Elba"?
Krish-Krush!
Krish-Krush!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I thought your father was in charge of Christmas decorations.
Oh, no, no, not this year.
We're doing it my way.
That's why I'm ordering a tasteful tree here.
They'll even deliver it on Christmas Eve fully decorated.
- Gee, that'll be fun for Freddie.
- Frederick won't be joining me.
He's spending his vacation on an archaeological tour with Lilith.
He's spending Christmas with dried-up old bones?
Yes, I thought I told you.
She's taking him on an archaeological tour.
Oh, good Lord, look how late it's gotten.
Well, don't blame me.
You're the one who spent 20 minutes looking for that candleholder thing.
No, no, no.
It's a menorah, Roz.
Thought I'd get one for Frederick for Hanukkah.
Oh, that's right.
I completely forgot Frederick is half Jewish.
Yes, between the Crane boy genes and Lilith's contribution, I'm not sure the NFL is holding its breath.
I need to go over to Notions and try to find something for Calvin, - the security guard.
- What are you getting him?
If I knew, I wouldn't be going to Notions.
Excuse me.
I'd like to get a gift for that woman I was with.
- How about this sweater right here?
- Excellent choice.
I'm not sure of the size.
Could you find me this in a medium?
Thank you.
- It's a madhouse in there.
- Roz!
People pushing and shoving for nose-hair clippers.
Is there a nasal hair epidemic I don't know about?
Here's your sweater.
- Is he talking to you?
- No, no, no, he's talking to He's talking to me.
It's for my niece.
But I'm a bit worried about the size.
You know, she's just about your height.
Do you mind my asking, would this fit you?
That's a little big for me.
- What about the colour?
A little blah?
- Personally, I like the blue.
I agree.
Thank you so much.
I will take a smaller size in the blue, and please gift-wrap it.
- Coming right up.
- It looks like Notions has thinned out.
Oh, good.
So you think Calvin will like the nose hair clippers?
I think we can be sure he doesn't own a pair.
Gosh, thank you so much for bailing me out that way.
My pleasure.
Helen.
- Helen?
Frasier.
- Not Frasier Crane?
- From the radio show?
- Yes.
I listen to you every time I come to Seattle to visit my daughter Faye.
Well, that's very kind.
You know, you really should know your wife's size.
- Oh, she's not my wife.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.
- It's all right.
- Girlfriend?
No, I don't have a girlfriend, actually.
I'm unattached.
Well, I've taken enough of your time.
Although, there is one small thing you could help me with.
I'm looking for something for my daughter.
Oh, what is it?
- No, I really shouldn't ask you.
- No, no, please.
No, no, it's too much of an imposition.
No, no, the way you came to my rescue, I'd be delighted to help you.
What is it you're looking to get for your daughter?
A date with a nice unattached doctor.
Well, I certainly walked into that one, didn't I?
It wasn't my first time.
As soon as this woman gets here, give me five minutes and call me on my cell phone.
If I am miserable, I will simply say it's an emergency and excuse myself.
Yes, the ever-valuable escape call.
Oh, you've done them?
No, but I've seen them done.
Excuse me, are you Frasier?
Faye?
Yes, well, hello.
How did you know it was me?
You had that horror-stricken look of someone who's met my mother.
No, please, please.
Shall we?
That's sweet of you, but you don't have to go through with this.
I just came to apologise.
No, please.
Please, why don't you sit down?
Hey, Dr. Crane.
Are you here with your brother?
No, actually, he's on a blind date.
Oh, he is, isn't he?
Oh, look at him.
I think he really fancies her.
You know, it's always so obvious when a man likes a woman.
You can just tell by his awkward body language.
Shifting in his chair, he doesn't know quite what to do with his hands.
He's as nervous as a hen.
Oh, for God's sakes, stop fidgeting!
So your mother tells me that you're a lawyer.
Well, that's typical.
I was a lawyer and I quit two years ago and now I'm a pastry chef.
- Really?
- Yes.
I work in a French restaurant in town.
Maybe you've heard of it.
Le Cigare Volant?
It's one of my favourites.
I had dinner there last Friday.
I worked Friday.
What did you have?
- The Grand Marnier soufflé.
- I made that!
- Well, it was poetry on a plate.
- Thank you.
You didn't happen to find my earring in it, did you?
I'm kidding.
You know, suddenly I'm glad that your mother is as pushy as she is.
It's funny, though, you're nothing like her.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Dr. Crane, can I ask a favour?
What are you doing for the next ten nights?
- Because my - Yes.
Excuse me, finish the question.
Well, my neighbourhood theatre group is putting on a holiday revue.
We're performing in the common room of Dr. Crane's building.
- Right downstairs?
- Yeah.
Well, we're still looking for a musical director.
I would never ask you, but they put me in charge of the whole thing.
Oh, well, count me in.
Is the show more religious in tone or secular?
Well, we couldn't quite agree, so we ended up with a mixed bag.
We open with the no-room-at-the-inn scene, then it's a rousing version of "Jingle Bell Rock," a brief medley from Jesus Christ Superstar.
The first act ends with Santa's elves and the Three Wise Men linking arms and singing "Frosty the Snowman".
Well.
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.
Of course, I love Boston, but, well, there's no place like home.
Excuse me.
Yes, hello?
Yes, no, you know what?
I'll just have to sign those papers later.
Thank you.
Office work.
That was an escape call, wasn't it?
No, what are you talking about?
Come on, it's a blind date.
You wanted a way to back out.
Oh, gosh, you are sharp, aren't you?
How did you know?
Well, that would be just lovely.
All right, I'll see you soon.
Well, isn't that nice?
Faye's dropping by.
You've been seeing a lot of her lately, haven't you?
Yes, I have.
You know, she really is quite wonderful.
Thought she was off to Florida with her mother.
Yes.
They're popping by on the way to the airport.
I guess someone wanted to rack up a few more frequent Frasier miles.
You don't ever actually say those things to the woman, do you?
Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, good, Dr. Crane, you're here.
- Yes, the show starts in half an hour.
Could you give me a hand?
I still have to sew the chains to Jacob Marley's tux for the dance number.
- Oh, happy to.
- Jacob Marley?
They're doing A Christmas Carol too?
No, they're not.
They worked him into the nativity scene.
Hey, Fras, where's a good spot for Rudolph this year?
Dad, please, I thought we had an agreement about the decorations.
I know, but what's Christmas without Rudolph?
He is not even one of the original reindeer.
Do the others have a song?
I'm not having this discussion again!
Because you know I'm right.
Forget it.
I wouldn't want to ruin your designer Christmas.
- Oh, Faye!
- Hi.
Hi.
Good to see you.
Here, let me take your coat.
- Thank you.
- Where's Helen?
She's talking to your doorman.
She's trying to fix him up with my cousin Janet and I couldn't bear to watch.
Oh, I'll just leave that ajar for her there.
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?
- You have a wreath.
- Yes, so?
- Aren't you Jewish?
- No.
No, why do you ask?
The day we met, my mother saw you shopping for a menorah.
Yes, for my son.
My ex-wife is Jewish.
- Oh, God.
- Is there a problem?
For me, no, but my mother is another story.
Here I was wondering what we'd talk about on a seven-hour flight to Miami.
You know what, I can just take this down.
No, no, no, I have to stop being a child about these things.
If she's upset, she's upset.
- How many stopovers do you have?
- Two.
- I'll take it down.
- Thank you.
- I really appreciate you doing this.
- Oh, it's no problem.
Can't believe I'm asking you to pretend to be Jewish on Christmas Eve.
It's all right, really.
It probably won't even come up.
- Hello?
- Oh, there she is.
- Hello, Frasier.
- Helen!
Hi.
Oh, what a beautiful apartment you have.
Thank you very much.
Get out!
- What?
- Of that coat already.
- So, Frasier, you grew up in Seattle?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
- Such a pretty city.
- Yes.
I guess you were bar mitzvahed here.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
What a proud day that was.
I can still remember reading from the Torah before the rabbi and the cantor and the mohel.
The mohel?
The one who did your circumcision?
Yes, yes, I just wanted to show him that there were no hard feelings.
- Niles!
- Hello, all.
You must be Faye.
And I'm her mother, Helen Moskowitz.
- And I'm Frasier's brother, Niles.
- Yes.
What happened to the?
Moskowitz that lived down the hall?
They moved.
Why don't you help me in the kitchen?
I'm just about to pour everybody a drink.
What's going on?
Faye's mother thinks that we're Jewish.
Just play along.
Okay.
Why?
Well, it's important to Faye, Faye is important to me.
- You think you can pull it off?
- No problem.
Oh, ham.
Niles.
Please.
We've got to find a time to tell Dad about this too.
- You mean Papa.
- Stop it.
- Wait, Frasier.
- What?
- Is that for Helen?
- Yes.
What if she's expecting Jewish wine?
- I'm afraid I don't have that on hand.
- That's all right.
It's easy enough.
It's just like regular wine, plus a little of this.
Try that.
- It's dreadful.
- Perfect.
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you.
Who has a nice toast?
Niles?
Oh, all right.
Next year in Jerusalem.
Take it down a notch, Tevye.
Hey, Fras, you know, since it's the night before - Dad!
- Oh, great.
Would it be a crime for somebody to tell me we had guests here?
Hi, I'm Marty Crane.
I'm Frasier's dad.
Although you'd never guess it from the way I'm treated like a second-class citizen around here.
But, as long as Frasier's happy, why should my feelings matter?
Niles, why don't you see if you can go help Dad in the kitchen?
Well, all right, but he'll probably just kvetch at me - and frankly, I don't need the tsuris.
- Niles!
I don't know how to be Jewish.
Just answer questions with a question.
- Like what?
- I have to explain everything?
- Can't you give me an example?
- What, I should give you an example?
You gonna help me or not?
- You're saying I'm not being helpful?
- Oh, forget it!
So, Marty, both your sons are doctors.
How'd you work that out?
I have no idea do I?
Well, I just got the phone call every producer dreads.
- What is it?
- Someone's dropping out of the show.
You don't suppose you could take over one of the roles?
Well, I don't see why not.
I know all the songs.
- Wonderful.
- Oh, it was nice meeting you both.
Likewise.
We're leaving too.
Could you send the elevator back up?
- We'll be right down.
- Happy to.
- So who dropped out?
- Mr. Blanchard.
It's been great spending some time with the two of you.
I wish you could stay longer.
Well, actually, we can.
I just called the airline.
The plane is delayed an hour.
Well, isn't that good news?
You know, I hate to be forward, but I'd love to taste whatever smells so wonderful in that kitchen.
And I would love to give you a taste, except it isn't done yet.
Well, more good news!
I don't know how much longer we can continue this charade.
My God, when Dad started to talk about working on his own car, I thought we were goners.
Well, we only have to keep it up for another half an hour.
Actually, I think I have an idea.
- Go out there.
- Okay.
Well, I don't know what it is with that brisket.
It just won't cook through.
- I could take a look.
- No, no, we don't have the time.
I just got off the phone with the airlines.
They pushed the flights back up.
We have to get going.
Oh, really?
All right.
Gosh, you know, I wish you could stay longer.
It's just that I'd hate to have you be late for your plane.
- Hello, sir.
- On the other hand, you know, you can't leave until you've seen the apartment.
- What?
- All right, let's start in the bedroom.
There's plenty of time.
Oh, Dad, could you see who that is and make sure they come back later?
Whatever you want, Frasier, as usual.
Hello, sir.
Let me wish you a merry Bring that thing back in an hour.
No way, sir.
It's Christmas Eve and I've got a full truck downstairs.
- So where do you want it?
- Oh, jeez, I don't know.
You know, a lot of people put them in their living rooms.
Oh, here, here, put it in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Just put it in, all right?
- All right, come on, quick.
- Okay.
- You have, you know, a mer - Shut up.
Get out.
- That's a beautiful bedroom, Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, thank you very much.
I noticed you were sort of quiet, Faye.
Almost as though you'd been in there before, huh?
Oh, yeah, I have, Ma, but I was drunk and it was dark.
I don't remember so much.
You see how she talks to her mother?
Jesus!
I'll tell you what.
I just realised that you haven't seen the beautiful balcony.
Dad, would you do the honours and I'll check on the brisket?
What is going on?
The man who does the number from Jesus Christ Superstar can't go on.
He slipped in the shower.
Man could walk on water, but no Yes, it's dripping with irony.
Niles, what are you doing here?
The minute I got within ten feet of the hay for the manger scene, my allergies kicked in.
I think I left my nasal spray here.
I am terribly sorry, but you've got to get out of here!
- Is that kind of language appropriate?
- Oh, just shut up!
Would you believe it?
It's still pink in the middle.
By the time my brisket's done, my kugel will be dry as the Sinai.
It certainly is beautiful, but now I think we're cutting it close.
Yes, you know, you're quite right.
We can continue the tour at another time.
Let me walk you to the door.
Thank you so much, Frasier.
You're a wonderful host.
Oh, well.
You know, maybe I should go to the powder room before we go.
Oh, here, allow me.
What is going on?
Helen, I am so terribly sorry.
I'll let you all sort this out.
I really have to go.
I understand.
This is your busy time.
Ma, Frasier's not Jewish.
I told them to pretend so you wouldn't freak out.
What?
You think I care?
You can date anyone you want.
Since when?
I can't believe you're embarrassing me like this.
You embarrass me on an hourly basis.
I embarrass you?
Are you hearing this?
You know, maybe we should just give you your privacy.
No one leaves.
You see?
You are making them uncomfortable in their own home.
You could have trusted me to understand.
All I want is for you to be happy.
As long as I'm happy in the life that you pick out for me.
Excuse me for being a terrible mother.
All I do is care.
Oh, here it comes, the guilt.
Just because I don't want you controlling my whole life.
What do you want me to do about it, cut myself out of it?
You hate me?
Sometimes, I do hate you!
I'm sorry, Ma.
I shouldn't have said that.
Why not?
I am too involved.
It's because you're all I have.
But you can't keep running my life.
- Maybe we should just - Sit.
We're nearly done.
I have been smothering you.
Maybe it's time I learned to let you go.
I don't wanna be let go.
I want you in my life, just not running it.
- I do love you, Mom.
- Oh, baby.
I love you too.
- Well, we should go.
- Right.
Oh, thank you for a lovely visit.
Enjoy your holiday.
- I am so sorry about all this.
- Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
Call me when you get back.
Good night.
- Boy, that was something.
- It certainly was.
Yeah, we've had a couple squabbles today, but nothing like that.
No way.
Maybe I should get that Christmas tree out of the bathroom.
Yeah, right.
One minute, they're talking about one little problem, then suddenly, it's everything else.
Then it gets all emotional and messy, and then they're hugging and then it's all over.
I suppose that's the healthiest way to go about it.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess you can't keep that stuff bottled up.
No, you sit on it, you just get madder and madder.
Yeah, best thing is lay it on the line.
- Exactly.
- Yeah.
Frasier, I want my Rudolph out for Christmas.
- What, this again?
- It's just not Christmas without it.
Dad, we had an agreement about the Christmas decorations this year.
Yeah, but your Christmas stinks!
I mean, you call that a tree?
Would it kill you to have a tasteful Christmas just once in your life?
Every year, we do Christmas your way.
And you have things your way every damn day!
I mean, look at it.
There's nothing of mine around this place except for my chair.
And you've taken potshots at that right from the start because it doesn't fit in with your froufrou knickknacks.
Right, go ahead, ridicule everything I do.
The way I eat, the way I decorate.
Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?
Know how it makes me feel to live like a guest in my home?
I do everything to make you feel welcome in this house, but nothing I do is good enough!
Strange way to make me feel welcome, taking Christmas away.
The one time of the year when I get to do things my way, like it used to be in our home, with your mother and when you were kids.
You know, that's a nice memory for me.
You'd think, as a psychiatrist, you'd figure that out.
Oh, fine.
Now, I'm not even a good psychiatrist.
I'm just a big, fat letdown, aren't I?
I'm a burden to you.
I hate living here.
And I hate you living here.
- Oh, my God.
- Jeez.
- Oh, God, I feel terrible.
- So do I. They were hugging by now.
We never should have tried this.
We're not Jewish.
Maybe Mrs. Shapiro next door can talk us through it.
- She's out of town.
- Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I never should have said what I said.
Oh, Dad, no, I should have been more sensitive.
I am a psychiatrist.
And you're a damned good one, too, and I'm very proud of you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean any of the things I said.
I love having you here.
Well, I love being here.
I always have.
Honestly?
Well, no, but I thought it'd get us to the hug.
All right, let's try.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
So when's Freddie coming in?
He's arriving in a few hours.
I'm picking him up at the airport.
Gosh, you know, I'm so excited to see him.
And it was Lilith's turn this year to have him for his birthday, but apparently there was an accident at the lab.
One of her monkeys bit her on the tongue.
What exactly was she doing with the monkey?
She's was teaching them sign language.
I guess one of them made a disparaging remark about her new haircut.
She stuck her tongue out.
Wow, how bad does a haircut have to be for a monkey to hate it?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to get myself a cup of coffee.
Oh, somebody dropped a wallet.
Is he cute?
It's hard to tell from a driver's license photo, but he is 5-foot-6, weighs 200 pounds, and has corrective lenses.
Leave it on the floor.
Well, thank God I don't share your good-deeds-for-hunks-only policy.
Excuse me, - I found this on the floor - Is that my wallet you got there?
Is it?
Well, I found it on the floor over there.
I was about to drop it off at the counter.
Please, no reward.
- What happened to my cash?
- Well, I don't know.
It was empty when I found it.
Yeah, right.
I had seven bucks in here.
Well, I'm sure some lucky thief is off enjoying a matinee and a small soda.
At least you left my credit card.
Jerk.
Would you please bring me my usual?
Can you believe that guy?
I do him a favour, he accuses me of stealing.
Oh, please.
The world is full of creeps like that.
Haven't you figured that out yet?
I'm sorry, Roz, but I still believe that people are basically good.
Hey, guys, I'm glad you're here.
- I need to talk to you about something.
- What can I do for you, Bulldog?
My mom's having bypass surgery tomorrow morning, and I'd like to sit up with her tonight at the hospital.
But I gotta work the 11 -to-1 spot.
I don't suppose you'd think Oh, right.
Like we don't know there's a big fight in Vegas tonight.
Look, I know I've jerked you guys around before, but this is serious.
Bulldog, I'm sorry.
Frederick's coming in tonight.
It's his birthday.
Okay, doc.
Never mind.
I understand.
Hello, Bernice Brisco's room, please.
I hope my mom's around to celebrate her next birthday.
Hi, Mom, it's Bobby.
Look, I'm gonna have to work tonight after all.
Bulldog, wait a minute.
You know what?
Frederick will be asleep by 11:00.
I guess we could take your slot.
Are you insane?
How can you be so gullible?
He is not talking to his mother.
Does somebody have a boo-boo on her heart?
Is someone gonna have to open you up with those big old rib spreaders?
Oh, Mrs. Brisco, I'm so sorry.
Listen, I just wanted you to know that we'll fill in for Bobby tonight.
Thanks a million, you guys.
- I'd better get back to the hospital.
- God bless, Bulldog.
Oh, I can't believe I said that.
That poor woman.
- We're outta here.
- Our flight doesn't leave - for another two hours.
- I gotta stop by my mom's first.
I owe her 50 bucks and case of Schlitz.
Should I even ask?
These balloons come in an unsealed package, covered with some mysterious dust, straight from some Southeast Asian sweatshop.
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Oh, you bet it does.
I remember back in Korea we'd crouch in our foxholes scared to death those bastards were gonna drop balloons on us.
The doorman called.
They're on their way.
Don't know how much of a surprise it's gonna be anyway.
- You did the same thing last year.
- That's the point.
He'd never suspect I'd do it two years in a row.
I must say I feel a bit bad for Freddie.
None of his mates are here, just the three of us old fogies yelling "Surprise".
Any party that he's at with you is gonna be a treat for him.
He's got a little crush on you.
If you really want Frederick to enjoy himself, he especially likes you in that little blue cocktail dress.
I'm not sure that dress is appropriate for a child's birthday party.
Well, it's hardly a party.
It's just us fogies.
You know, Frederick, your granddad really wanted to be here, but he had an important Rotary Club meeting.
- What?
- Not another surprise party.
- What are you talking about?
- Just like last year.
Oh, Lord, all right, all right, I'll tell you what, just don't let on, okay?
You know how he loves this stuff.
Just act surprised, all right?
The hardest thing is pretending to be fooled - by the trick candles.
- Oh, gosh.
You think it's hard now, wait until you're my age.
Surprise!
- Oh, wow!
I'm so surprised.
- You see?
I told you.
- Hey, Freddie.
- How are you doing?
Happy birthday.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Just let me get the phone.
Hello?
Yes, who's calling, please?
Wewef?
Anyone here know a Wewef?
Oh, Lilith.
Yes, hello, Lilith.
What's that?
Oh, right, yes, of course he's here.
It's your mom.
Why don't you take it into your granddad's room?
- Okay.
Hi, Mom.
- Let's get the cake ready.
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, Frasier, I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised.
- Voila!
- What the hell is that?
It's Louis Pasteur, Freddie's favorite scientist.
What child wouldn't be thrilled with a coconut death mask on his birthday?
Frasier, what happened to your jacket?
Oh, at the airport, I helped this woman get her dog into her car.
- Oh, I hope at least it was in a crate.
- Yes, very heavy crate.
I had to hold it at arm's length so that what I chose to believe was drool wouldn't run out onto my shoes.
Eight blocks later I finally load little Fido into her backseat, woman drives off without so much as a thank-you or an offer to give me a ride to the airport.
I responded with the time-honored gesture of disapproval, but on the upswing I caught my finger on the jacket and Oh, thank you.
I must say my belief in people's basic decency has taken a beating today.
Earlier, I returned a man's wallet.
He accused me of stealing.
Well, it just proves what I always say, a good Samaritan is nothing but a good target.
I'm sorry, Dad, I'm not ready to be quite that cynical yet.
- He's off the phone.
- Oh, good.
All right.
You can believe what you want, but I think people are born rotten and every year they get worse.
Happy birthday to you Welcome back to the night-owl edition of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show.
We have Stephen on line two.
Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.
I think I'm losing my mind, Dr. Crane.
People are talking to me through my radio.
- Why do you think that?
- There it is again.
- Turn your radio down.
- Now it's giving me orders.
Stephen, turn your radio down.
It knows my name.
Stephen, listen to me, this is your radio talking.
I'm a very smart radio, and I care about you, and I want you to turn me off.
Go to bed and seek counselling in the morning.
Okay.
Sorry, doc, can't talk anymore.
Well, I'd like to end tonight on a philosophical note.
You see, earlier today, I helped some people.
I returned a man's wallet, and I aided a woman at the airport.
And in return, I was accused of being a thief, and my favourite jacket was ruined.
I was so disappointed by the events of the day that, on my way to work here tonight, I almost passed an elderly man with a flat tire without stopping to help him.
What the hell are you doing?
I asked myself.
How would I feel if I were in this man's position and no one stopped to help me?
Well, I did pull over, I helped the man, and frankly, it felt great.
So without sounding preachy, I would like to advise you all to do a good deed once in a while, if not for the sake of others, but then, well, for your own sake.
Thank you.
Now, let's go to station ID.
Roz, do you mind?
What is your problem?
I'm getting ready for bed.
Alice gets me up at the crack of dawn.
If I get all this taken care of, I get an extra half hour of sleep.
Well, at least you spared me the spectacle of flossing.
Thanks for reminding me.
I had corn.
And we're back.
It seems that we've got time for one more call.
Don't bother, Roz, I'll get it.
Go ahead, caller.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.
Hi, Dr. Crane, this is Ralph.
The guy whose tire you changed tonight.
Ralph!
Well, what a wonderful surprise.
Let me first say to our listeners, this call was not solicited in any way.
You go ahead, Ralph.
Dr. Crane, I was just wondering, do you wear cuff links?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I do, but there's no need to buy me a gift.
A gift?
You scratched the hell out of my paint job with those things.
You owe me money.
You can't be serious.
How much damage could cuff links do to a car whose side window consists of duct tape and a Hefty bag?
Well, you'll find out when my lawyer sends you the bill.
Let me remind you again, listeners, that call was not solicited.
Oh, great.
Somebody else in need of a good Samaritan.
Maybe if I ignore her, she'll stop waving.
But what am I gonna do?
Just leave her standing in the rain?
Then again, every one of my good deeds today has ended up biting me in the butt.
Such nasty weather.
May I offer you a ride?
Oh, thank you.
I didn't think anyone was gonna stop tonight.
Well, chivalry may be on life support, but it's not dead.
- Oh, seat warmers.
- Yes, they're standard.
There's a little control on the side if you want more leg room.
- Now where can I take you?
- It's up to you.
We can get a room or we can do it here in the car.
Oh, dear God.
- You are a prostitute.
- How far do these go back?
Look, I'm sorry.
There's been a mistake.
- Oh, don't be nervous, baby.
- I'm not nervous.
- Would you please put your seat up?
- I'll put it any way you like it, honey.
Stop talking to me that way.
For God's sake!
All right, now please, I'm sorry about this misunderstanding, but get out of my car.
- Why the hell did you pick me up?
- I was trying to be a gentleman.
Now get out.
I'm not walking all the way back to my corner.
- Give me some money for a cab.
- All right, fine.
Oh, Lord, I guess I must have left my wallet at the station.
How in the hell were you going to pay for me?
I wasn't going to pay for you!
Oh, here's a $20 bill.
Now get out.
God.
Get out.
Get out.
Hurry, get out now.
It's too late.
They've seen us.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Hello, officer.
Just how fast was I going?
Hey, don't I know you?
- No, no, I don't believe so.
- I'm not talking to you.
Didn't I bust you last week?
Give me a break, buddy.
I'm trying to earn a living here.
Was it really necessary to take my belt and tie?
Standard procedure.
It's for your own protection.
For God's sake, you had me in the drunk tank.
If I wanted to kill myself, I would've taken a deep breath.
- Frasier!
- Niles.
You certainly took your sweet time.
I've been waiting here two hours.
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.
I guess what with the pillow fight in the holding tank and the pre-mug shot makeover, time just got away from me.
Will you stop it!
Just bail me out of here.
I can't stand another minute in this place.
All right.
Excuse me.
If you could get our bill together, we're ready to settle up here.
It's 500 bucks.
Five hundred Frasier, I don't have that kind of cash on me.
Put it on your credit card.
And have "bail" appear on my statement?
Do you know the kind of junk mail I would get?
Just do it.
Okay.
There you are.
So, what happened?
A prostitute?
Please, I told you on the phone, I didn't know she was a prostitute.
I saw a woman stranded in the rain.
Naturally, I offered her a ride.
Before I knew it, I was handcuffed to this bench, surrounded by this motley assortment of other wrongfully accused gentlemen.
- Sir, your card didn't go through.
- What?
That's right, Maris' lawyers had my credit limit reduced.
Oh, no.
Been so bad this week when I went to the cheese shop for their Around the World platter, they cut me off at Luxembourg.
Would you please call Dad and get him down here?
All right.
All right.
Yeah, Dad, hi.
My credit card was declined.
Well, we need yours.
Yeah.
Well, right, yeah, I'll see you soon.
This is intolerable.
It'll take him 20 minutes to get here.
- No, no, he's waiting in the car.
- What?
Why didn't he come in?
Frasier, this was his old precinct.
When we pulled up outside, I saw a look on his face I haven't seen since he drove us home from our first and only Little League game.
- Oh, Dad.
- Hey, hold it down, will you?
Dad, I'm so sorry.
What happened was No, I don't need to know.
I didn't come down here to judge.
- You're my son, and I love you.
- Yes, for God's sakes, Dad, I didn't Why don't we pay up, and get out of here, okay?
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Fred.
Listen, I wouldn't take this too hard, Marty.
You remember Captain Petchesky's son turned out to be the Colman Park pervert.
- Yeah, thanks.
- And Sergeant O'Brien's daughter - does all them cable movies.
- Yeah, I heard.
You can pick her out.
She's got his chin.
Yeah, could we just get on with it here?
Dad, will you let me explain?
Frasier, look, I understand.
I was in the Army.
We all have our urges.
- But you don't understand.
- Just sign here.
All that happened was Bye, Dr. Crane.
Sorry I got you arrested.
Oh, that's all right, Crystal.
These things happen.
He had a wig on.
- You're my son and I love you.
- Oh, would you stop saying that!
I still don't know what you were thinking.
The middle of the night, deserted street, picking up a strange woman.
A very strange woman.
Well, obviously I wasn't thinking.
Thank God now it's all over.
I can just spend a quiet weekend here with Frederick.
Oh, dear God!
"Doc's Pal is a Mock Gal".
Will this nightmare never end?
Now listen, Dad, we're bound to get a lot of calls about this thing.
Please do not answer the phone.
Don't talk to anybody.
Let the machine get it.
Don't give them anything they can turn tawdry.
Yeah, I live with Dr. Crane.
Yeah, there's quite a bit of massage involved.
Daphne!
Mostly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.
No.
Give me that.
No comment!
Oh, no, Daphne, please, don't answer the phone.
Let the machine pick up.
Well, the machine's filled up.
Everyone's been calling.
- Oh, God.
Where's Frederick?
- He's still asleep.
Look, Dr. Crane, I just want to say you're the victim here.
Thank you.
American society's so close-minded when it comes to sexual experimentation.
- In Europe - Daphne, I didn't do anything wrong!
Well, exactly.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, God, I guess I deserve all this.
I certainly had enough warning to stop being such a Boy Scout.
But did I listen?
No.
Well, from now on, Dr. Crane, or as Seattle now knows him, "Dr. Strangelove" is out of the Samaritan business.
Thank you, Niles.
Frasier, have you given much thought to what you're going to tell Frederick?
Oh, God.
How can I possibly explain it to him?
Well, I guess the key is not to be evasive.
He's gonna hear about it sooner or later.
I guess it should be from me.
After all, I am a trained professional.
I'll be able to do it in a way that won't traumatize the child.
Freddie, don't touch that!
You know, I could use a glass of orange juice.
I think I'm gonna go in the kitchen and get a glass.
Oh, orange juice.
Yum.
I'm going to come with you for that.
- Am I having another surprise party?
- No.
No, Frederick, here, sit down for a second, son.
I've got something I've got to talk to you about.
For the next couple of days, you're gonna hear some rather nasty stories and some snide jokes about your old man.
Mom's coming?
No.
No, no, she's not.
It's It's very hard for me to tell you this, but I just spent the night in jail.
Wow, like Brad Johnson's dad.
Well, that was different.
Insider trading is wrong.
- What did you do?
- Well, I saw a woman standing in the rain, and I gave her a ride.
You can go to jail for that?
Well, it depends on the sort of woman.
You see, this particular woman, this person was a prostitute.
But I didn't know that until it was too late.
A prostitute?
Oh, God, how can I explain this?
A prostitute is someone who engages in sexual relations with other people for money.
Dad, I'm 11.
I know what a prostitute is.
But why did you pick one up?
Well, you see, I didn't know that it was a prostitute at the time.
I was only trying to do a good deed.
And I guess in hindsight, it was all a big mistake.
I just should have minded my own business.
So, what are you saying, Dad?
You shouldn't try to help people?
Well - May I offer you a ride?
- Oh, thank you.
I waved at you a couple of times, but I didn't think you saw me.
Yes, well, I noticed you.
I was just having sort of a bad daydream.
So where can I take you?
Same place you're going.
- Oh, dear God, you're - Laura Hilton.
- I live in your building.
- Of course.
Laura.
Hi.
I'm so glad you stopped when you did.
Oh, I'm certainly glad I stopped too.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening.
Hi, Dr. Crane.
My husband's having some of his friends over to watch the game on Sunday, and I think it'd be nice if some of my girlfriends could come over too.
- Sounds reasonable.
- Exactly.
I mean, it's just football.
Not football, Einstein.
The Super Bowl.
That would be your doting husband now.
Larry, this is a private conversation.
And for God's sakes, use a plate.
Sophie, why don't you put your husband on the line?
- Pick up.
- Jeez.
Hello?
Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid I side with your wife on this one.
That just proves you don't know the first thing about football.
What I do or do not know about football has Okay, how's this?
My wife's friends can come over if you can answer even one little football question.
Like I don't see that's necess You're down by six.
You're on your own 40.
Three seconds left.
What do you do?
Well, all right.
You would You would take your receivers and line them up and then throw a pass.
A long, long pass.
Yeah, and what's the name for that?
A Hail Mary.
Sophie and Larry, I hope you enjoy the game.
In the meanwhile, this is Coach Crane saying, I'm listening.
I'm impressed.
You're so good at charades.
I'm impressed you could mime a virgin.
So, Roz, are you walking out?
No, I got stuff to do.
I've got some cards to rack and I wanna put together some Best of Crane tapes.
- Oh, your mother's still in town?
- In town, in my apartment.
And when I left this morning, in my refrigerator, smelling my milk.
- Oh, Lord.
- I love her, I just wish I could get a couple of hours to myself one night.
You know, why don't you just ask her?
She might enjoy a little time to herself.
I know my dad does.
You are so lucky.
I wish my mother drank alone.
You know, Roz, your mom's about the same age as my dad, isn't she?
- Yeah, I guess.
- Does she date much?
Since my father left?
Practically never.
No, hang on.
No, no, hear me out, Roz.
Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody since he and Sherry broke up.
I'm starting to worry he's lost his nerve.
A date with your mom could be a tremendous favour to him.
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, I'll tell you what.
It's awkward, but we can minimise that.
Niles and I are having dinner with him.
We'll take him to McGinty's, he'll feel comfortable.
You and your mom can just happen by.
We'll see what transpires.
They'll never even know it's a fix-up.
Oh, what the hell.
I'll give it a shot, I guess.
- Okay.
- How does 5 sound?
Five?
Your mother's ready for dinner at 5?
I keep her on Wisconsin time.
That way, she's in bed by 8.
Hey, look what I got here, boys.
A Funyun Onion.
The chef sent it over with his compliments.
I wonder what his insults are like.
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Hey, Marty.
- Oh, you must be Frasier, - Why, yes.
- The big radio star.
- Hello.
- Your dad is so proud of you.
- Oh, Dad.
He talks about you all the time.
Who's your friend?
Now, what's wrong with you?
I told you about my other son.
Oh, of course.
What am I thinking?
Nice to meet you, Eddie.
This is Niles.
How about some beers, Bonnie?
Coming right up.
- Oh, God.
- What?
The group coming in the door.
They're from the Shangri-La.
- Whoa, it's the Coyote!
Hey!
- Yes, hello.
Evening, evening, Jimbo.
Check you later.
Wow, you got a nickname down there already.
- That's great.
The Coyote?
- Yes, yes.
And how did you earn that honorific?
It was quite the merry road, yes.
It evolved from Niles to Nilesy to Niley to Nile E. Coyote and now, simply, the Coyote.
Well, just when I thought it couldn't be refined any further.
Goodness, look who's here.
Roz!
What?
We don't see enough of each other during the day?
Isn't this amazing?
Hello, Joanna.
- It's nice to see you again, Frasier.
- Nice to see you again too.
Please, won't you sit down and join us?
Oh, no, no, we don't want to intrude.
Oh, no, no, no, please, please, please, the more the merrier.
All right.
Mom, this is Frasier's dad, Martin Crane.
- This is my mother, Joanna Doyle.
- Very nice to meet you.
- And this is my other son, Niles.
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.
Roz, would you just look at the two of them?
How did you two manage to finish all that?
Oh, please, this is how our generation ate every day.
I used to live on cigarettes, whisky sours and bacon cheeseburgers.
Yeah, and what about breakfast?
Fried eggs, sausage patties, hash browns.
My God.
Last night, I ate a profiterole and lay awake till dawn, waiting for my heart attack.
Those were simpler times, weren't they, Marty?
Oh, yeah, we didn't worry about dumb things like cholesterol.
We worried about putting food on the table, keeping the yard clean and the car shiny.
- And the H-bomb.
- Well, yeah, right.
Say, Roz, we better get going if we're gonna get our work done tonight.
Oh, I should be running too.
But Mom and I are going to that jazz club on 5th.
But we promised to finish those promos tonight.
Oh, right.
- Mom, I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.
- It's okay.
Wait, I've got an idea.
Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz, why don't you take Joanna to the jazz club?
Well, sure, I'd love to.
- Is that okay with you, Mom?
- If Martin's game, I'm game.
- Oh, well, perfect.
- Great.
Okay, you kids just have some coffee.
We'll see you back at the apartment later, okay?
All right, all right.
- It was very, very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
Look at them.
They think we don't know this is a setup.
Well, how could we figure it out?
We're just a retired detective and an attorney general.
You were absolutely right.
They didn't suspect a thing.
I told you, Roz, just leave it to the master.
God, I thought they'd be home by now.
Roz, would you please relax and watch the pageant with us?
They're right in the middle of the talent competition.
It's shameless the way they're sucking up to the international panel of judges.
Miss Germany just played "Lady of Spain" on her French horn.
At least it wasn't half as bad as that tone-deaf performance by the aptly named Miss Singapore.
Roz, you're gonna chew that nail right off.
Stop it.
I can't help it.
I'm nervous.
Do you think it's gonna turn out okay?
- Who cares?
- Not for Miss Brazil.
Look at the tree trunks on her.
She's her own little rainforest.
I just keep worrying that she's gonna have a lousy time and it'll be all my fault.
Screwing up, like always.
Oh, come on, Roz, your mother doesn't think you're a screw-up.
Yeah?
In high school, I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic.
In college, I dropped out of pre-law because it interfered with Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule.
And now, I am currently an unwed mother.
- What would you call me?
- Tramp.
Daphne!
It's Miss Venezuela.
If that dress of hers was slit any higher, you could see Caracas.
Oh, Roz, you know what?
So what if they don't get along?
I mean, my God, so we made a mistake.
You don't understand.
My mother doesn't make mistakes.
She does everything well.
She's smart, successful, classy.
Oh, what the hell was I thinking?
About what?
Setting her up with my father?
- No, that's not what I meant.
- That is exactly what you meant.
Well, okay, Frasier.
No offence, your father is a very nice man, but let's face it.
My mother was the attorney general of Wisconsin.
Well, I hope he remembers to curtsy before the Dairy Queen.
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna watch this in my room.
Miss Finland just laid out her plan to end world hunger and I missed it.
- Oh, Lord, okay.
- They're back.
Oh, Roz, that is the best promo of all.
Oh, hi.
How was your evening?
Oh, the jazz was first-rate, but I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off.
Oh, you're crazy.
Your mother tells wonderful stories, Roz.
- I could have listened to her all night.
- You are either too kind or a little tipsy.
But thank you.
- Come on, Lambie.
- Okay, let me get my coat.
I really had a lovely time.
Well, I can't remember when I had a better time.
We're gonna have to do this again.
- Bye, Frasier.
- Good night, Joanna.
- Lambie.
- Bye.
So tell me all about it.
Come on.
Well, being a gentleman, I don't wanna go into details.
- So suffice it to say, it stunk!
- What?
That was the dullest evening of my life.
- The way she drones on and on.
- Oh, no.
Do you know how many metric tons of eggs Wisconsin produces every year?
- No.
- Well, I do.
Look, Frasier, I know you meant well.
But if you ever set me up again, I'll kill you in your sleep.
Good night.
Roz.
I told my mom to meet me downstairs.
I just had to come up and tell you.
She had the best time.
She can't wait to go out with your father again.
Will you tell him to call her tomorrow?
Frasier, this whole thing worked out like a dream.
It's amazing.
Her voice is still echoing in my head.
Yes, it's like a fairy tale over here too.
I've just got to find some way to tell Roz.
Well, why?
It's just gonna hurt her mom's feelings.
Her feelings are gonna be hurt anyway.
She's here till Sunday.
She's expecting him to call.
Oh, dear God.
At least this way, Roz can let her down easy.
It looks like both of us have difficult conversations ahead of us.
- What's yours?
- All week long, I have been getting less coffee and more foam in my cappuccino.
It's about time for someone to raise a little hell.
Who's on steamer duty?
Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad.
The one who doesn't react when his arm touches the steamer nozzle.
Where is that suggestion box?
- Oh, hey, Frasier.
- Oh, Roz, hi.
Double espresso to go, please.
Listen, I really need to thank you again.
My mother had the best time last night.
And when we got home, we started talking.
We ended up staying up half the night.
- Oh, Roz, I'm glad for you, but - It was like a wall came down.
She just opened up to me.
She started telling me about how hard it was on her when my dad left and how Ionely she's been.
It was like she was talking to a girlfriend, instead of her screw-up daughter.
So has Martin called her yet?
No.
But he will, soon.
He had a really busy morning.
How does his weekend look?
Because she's leaving Sunday night.
Sunday?
Oh, well, let's see.
Tonight is poker night.
That's no good.
Saturday, he's made plans to drive Duke to Tacoma for that all-day Tacoma fest.
Well, and Sunday we go to a matinee and then I drive her to the airport.
Oh, darn.
Wait a minute, I can give my ticket to Martin and they can go together.
No, no, no, Sunday's no good, because that's - Oh, right.
It's the Super Bowl.
- Right.
The Super Bowl.
And you know how Dad is about football.
It's like a religion to him.
In fact, he's made Niles and I promise that we'd watch it with him this year.
Oh, well, okay, let's just forget about the tickets and we'll come over to your place and watch the game.
Is there any reason why that won't work?
Not that I can come up with.
That's great.
My mom's gonna be so excited.
- Oh, thank you, Niles.
- Oh, yeah.
I'll see you Sunday at your Super Bowl party.
I see you told Roz the news and she went insane.
Couldn't do it.
Told her we were watching the Super Bowl with Dad, and she and her mother are coming over.
This is a nightmare.
I know, I know.
I've got to find some way to tell Dad.
I have to watch the Super Bowl?
Suppose the sooner I tell him, the better.
Oh, not necessarily.
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know Dad.
If you warn him Joanna's coming over, he'll just bolt to McGinty's.
If I were you, I would wait till five minutes before game time, then spring it on him.
That way, he has no choice but to stay.
Well, I think I owe him more than five minutes' warning.
Besides that, Dad would never deliberately hurt Joanna by standing her up.
He is first and foremost a gentleman.
I saw Roz, so I hid outside in case that old gasbag of a mother was with her.
Well, I guess she wasn't.
Everybody's still awake.
Here we go.
Look at those guys in the locker room.
Nervous, hearts pounding, probably a little sick to their stomachs.
- The poor kids.
- Yes.
Until I got out of high school, I didn't know there was any other way to feel in a locker room.
What's the matter with you?
You keep looking at your watch.
- Was I?
- Yeah.
Is there something on your mind?
No.
No, no, no.
But there's something I need to talk to you about, but now is not the time.
- Now is the time.
- Just let me get the door.
No, Dad, that's what I have to talk to you about.
See, that's gonna be Roz and her mother.
- What?
- Well, Joanna had such a good time with you the other night, and you did say that you would see her again.
Rather than send her home with her feelings hurt, - I told her you wanted her here.
- What, like a date?
That's the beauty of it.
It's like a date, but it's not a date.
You just, you know, make small talk.
You pass the dip.
No, Frasier, you don't understand.
Look, Dad, I know that you found her a little less than scintillating, but please, it'll be over before you know it.
Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Martin.
Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it.
Let me hold that, yes.
See, this is what I was trying to tell you, Frasier.
- I invited Bonnie.
- Oh, how nice.
So, what do you got here?
Oh, it's my special devilled ham in the shape of a football.
But I still need to put on some macaroni laces.
Oh, okay.
Well, the kitchen's right down there.
Just holler if you need anything.
What did you invite her for?
I like her, I thought I might want to ask her out and if she came over, that'd be a step in the right direction.
You know, I mean, like a date, but not a date.
That's gonna be Roz and her mother.
Should I put some coffee on while I'm here?
You better.
We're gonna need it.
Come on, would it kill you to be civil for the length of one Super Bowl?
What is that, an hour out of your life?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry, come on in.
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- It wouldn't be any fun without you.
Could you show my mom where Alice can finish her nap?
I'm sure Dad would love to.
Dad?
My pleasure, yeah.
Just come this way, Joanna.
So you're a big football fan?
No, actually, I've never even seen a game.
I was hoping you would explain as we go along.
Okay, who's hungry?
Oh, hi, I'm Bonnie.
Hi.
From McGinty's.
Oh, I didn't know you were coming.
Yeah, Martin invited me.
He was real cute about it.
He checked with all the waitresses to find out if I was single.
Yes, well, you know how Dad is.
He's always trying to Hey, hey, the Coyote.
- Find a new girl for Niles.
Niles, you remember Bonnie.
She waited on us at McGinty's.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'll have a vodka martini, very dry.
Don't be silly, Niles.
Bonnie is here as our guest.
Yeah, your dad thought you two might hit it off.
The Super Bowl and a date.
Hot diggity.
Well, come here.
You're just in time for my specialty.
Isn't that interesting?
Something formerly ham.
- Well, I'm off to the cinema.
- You're not staying for the game?
Sorry, but American football's not for me.
And they're showing Wuthering Heights downtown.
I think it's the most romantic movie ever made.
- You're going alone?
- Yes, unfortunately.
It's more fun to go with someone.
Except, of course, it always ends the same way.
Me weeping all over me date's shoulder, while he does what he can to comfort me.
Well, you should've seen me cry putting onions in this ham loaf.
I must have gone through a whole roll of toilet paper.
Well, enjoy your game.
Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
That's amazing.
You do all that you do and still have time to be a docent at the cheese museum on the weekends.
Frasier, can I see you in the kitchen?
Just a second, Dad.
I gotta take drink orders in here.
Thanks for setting me up with that SPAM-happy tootsie.
What are you talking about?
Bonnie.
Frasier told me you invited her here for me.
I invited her here for me.
He said I invited her for you because he didn't wanna hurt Miss Boring's feelings.
Now, now, no private conversations.
Your dates are waiting.
- They're not our dates.
- We hate them.
Now, listen, I realise that this is a very difficult situation, but if we all cooperate, we can send everybody home happy.
And, Dad, if you would like, you can discreetly take Bonnie aside and tell her what's going on.
- Bonnie, can I tell you something?
- I said discreetly.
I think the game is about to start.
Oh, that reminds me.
I wanna get Alice's bottle warming.
- Oh, you have a baby?
- Oh, the most adorable little girl.
Yeah, she's a real beaut.
You ought to see her, Bonnie.
- You can come when I feed her.
- No, you go ahead and get that ready.
I'll show Bonnie.
It's right through there.
Now, Dad, don't you get fresh with Niles' girl there.
Oh, I won't if he won't.
Your father is really smitten with that baby, isn't he?
I think he's just got a weak spot for the Doyle women.
- Oh, now.
- Yes.
Well, he may appear to have a crusty exterior, but deep down inside, Dad's just an old softy.
Well, there's the kid.
Kind of a gooney-looking thing, isn't she?
Is that Dad?
Look, Bonnie, I gotta tell you something.
I didn't ask you here for Niles.
I asked you here for me.
It's the baby monitor.
We should - I wanna hear this.
- I thought you were with Joanna.
No, no, Frasier and Roz set us up last week.
I told Frasier I thought she was a big snooze, especially compared to the fun you and I have at the bar, but he stuck me with her again.
You know, I think they know it's on.
- They're just having some fun with us.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I better go tell him - Frasier, Frasier, just stay put.
Then Niles isn't my date?
Oh, there's a relief.
- I mean, no offence, Marty, but - Hey, you don't have to tell me.
Okay.
If anybody wants me, I'll be at the movies.
So you really like me?
You're not just pulling my leg?
- You want proof?
- I think we can turn this off now.
Joanna, I am so sorry.
- I know it sounded bad, but - No, no, no, not at all.
I'm sure your father meant "big snooze" in the most flattering sense.
- Roz, maybe we should leave.
- What were you thinking?
Oh, Roz, I certainly wasn't thinking that he had a date planned.
I'm just gonna get Alice.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
Believe me, 20 years in politics, I've been called worse things than boring.
Well, I hope you'll understand if I just slip out - without saying goodbye to Martin.
- Of course, Joanna.
The last thing we need today is another awkward situation.
Roz, knock, will you?
!
- I left my diaper bag.
- Right.
Here you go.
- Can you come in for a bit?
- I really shouldn't.
Roz, I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
I mean, I'm not gonna say that my mother wasn't hurt.
But she did start to smile a little bit about it on the way to the airport.
You know, I've been, well, sitting here, trying to figure out why I was so eager to play matchmaker for Dad.
Oh, you're not alone.
I mean, I was excited once I thought it was going well.
Well, I suspect I wasn't doing it so much for him as it was doing it for me.
You know, I see him here all the time, all alone.
I wonder if maybe that's not gonna be me someday.
Oh, my God, I think the same thing sometimes when I see these older ladies in my building.
They all wanna babysit Alice, just for the company.
I mean, she's a cute baby, but she ain't no Dorothy Parker.
Oh, well, you know, we're both gonna be fine.
- Yeah.
- I was just thinking, though, if we want to play it safe, we could make one of those pacts.
Oh, you mean like, in 40 years, if neither one of us finds anyone?
Yeah, exactly.
We'll marry each other.
I was gonna say kill each other.
Well, six of one.
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
So Dr. Crane, I don't see why I should fix the dumb dress when my sister can't even fit into it anymore.
Audrey, you borrowed the dress, you tore it.
As an old Greek haberdasher once said: "Euripides, Eumenides".
What?
Well, it's just a little joke on the ancient dramatist Euripides and the mythological Furies.
Just fix the dress.
We'll be back after the weather.
Oh, Roz, Noel gave me this to give to you.
- Here.
- Oh, God, Noel.
- He's been acting so weird lately.
- Lately?
May I remind you this is the man who's required by law to stay at least 100 yards away from William Shatner.
No, I bumped into him at Nervosa about a month ago.
There were no other free tables so we sat together, and since then, he's been acting like we're some kind of couple.
Oh, Roz, I'm sure he knows you're not interested in him.
- "Happy monthiversary".
- Oh, Lord.
Oh, we're on.
And we're back.
Let's get straight to the phones.
- I'm listening.
- Dr. Crane?
It's Woody.
I'm in Seattle and I'm a little lost.
Well, Woody, in today's fast-paced, high-pressure society, that's not uncommon.
Just why exactly do you feel lost?
Well, I've been driving around for about an hour.
I can't seem to get out of the airport.
Oh, Woody, Woody.
Oh, well, listeners, this is an old friend of mine from back in Boston.
Well, how are you doing there, you old cowpoke?
I'm doing okay, but all this talk about today's fast-paced, high-pressure world is starting to get me down.
Yes, well, I have just the cure for that.
How about dinner?
Sounds great.
I'm in town all week.
- And I'm free all week.
How's tonight?
- Oh, that'd be great.
- So I hear you're on the radio.
- Yes, I am, Woody, and so are you.
No, no, no, I'm still tending bar at Cheers.
Oh, how do these rumours get started?
Believe it or not, listeners, Woody and I are picking up right where we left off.
- Knock, knock.
- Noel.
Oh, I haven't seen that outfit before.
Set your phasers on stunning.
Listen, I need to talk to you.
I cannot accept anniversary gifts.
Oh, I know that.
I was just making a little joke.
I know we're just friends.
I saw this and it made me think of you.
Okay, thanks.
That's really sweet.
Oh, if you're not gonna open it for a while, you might wanna move the ribbon.
It's blocking the air holes.
Here, I made you some lamb stew.
I'm telling you, there's something weird about Eddie.
Oh, for the love of God, not this again.
You never should've taken him to those dog groomers.
I had to bring him.
His toenails were like Howard Hughes' and his breath smelled like an autopsy.
Well, look at him.
They did something to him.
The sparkle's gone from his eyes.
Yes, and so are those gooey green bits.
Oh, that's probably Woody.
I'll get it.
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.
I know this is impromptu, but I'm going to an oboe recital and I thought you might want to join me.
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.
An old friend of mine came in town.
I invited him to come over this evening.
Well, have him join us.
I'm sure we can get three seats together.
I'm not sure an oboe recital's quite what I had in mind.
I was thinking of something a little more raucous.
If it's raucous you're looking for, we could go and get a nightcap at the piano bar at the Mayflower Hotel.
It's Jerome Kern night.
Last time people were shouting out requests without raising their hands.
You know, Niles, I'm afraid we'll have to pass.
You see, my friend Woody is an old bar chum from back at Cheers What I had in mind was really more of a beer-swilling, back-slapping kind of night, if you know what I mean.
You're welcome to join us if you like.
- Sounds interesting.
- Well, now - Woody!
- Hey, Dr. Crane!
- Good to see you.
- You look great.
Oh, thanks, thanks.
You too.
- This place is awesome.
- Thank you.
I'm not surprised you need all these roommates to help you pay for it.
Well, they're not really roommates, Woody.
They're They're more like boarders actually.
- No, that's my father, Martin.
- Oh, hi.
- Woody Boyd.
- I remember hearing about you.
- You were a policeman, right?
- That's right.
That's my brother right there, Niles.
- He's a psychiatrist too.
- Hello.
And this is Daphne Moon, my father's home healthcare worker.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.
I like your accent.
- You're from England, right?
- Manchester.
Darn.
I'm usually pretty good at that.
- Oh, hey, who's this little guy?
- I'm not sure I even know anymore.
Oh, my dad's getting the same way.
- So, Woody, can I get you a beer?
- That's funny, huh?
You know, all those years I was waiting on you, and now you're getting me a beer.
Yes, life's like that sometimes, isn't it?
Daphne, get us a couple of beers, will you?
So, what brings you to Seattle, huh?
- Oh, my cousin's getting married.
- Really?
Which is the cousin?
Bride or groom?
Well, actually, both are.
I assume they're kissing cousins.
They're doing a lot more than that.
That's why they have to get married.
So is Kelly with you?
No, no, she's visiting her mom with the kids, but she sends her love.
- And how's the old gang, huh?
- Oh, well, they haven't changed much.
Sam's doing great, Carla's terrific.
Oh, you know, we almost had a wedding.
Mr. Clavin got himself one of those Eastern European mail-order brides.
But they lived together for a couple of days and decided to call it off.
Oh, gosh.
I'm so sorry for Cliff.
Yeah, she said she was homesick.
That Bosnia must be a beautiful place.
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.
That's one for you, one for you, and one for me.
Well, Woody, I thought that tonight we'd just maybe stay in.
- You know, order some pizza.
- Sounds good by me.
Okay, great.
I'll just call the place around the corner.
- Niles, you're gonna join us?
- Well, why not.
It'll be fun to drink some beer and have some pizza with a couple of rapscallions.
If you don't mind, could we make that half rapscallions, half pepperoni?
That wasn't the best prank we played.
You remember that time with Mr. Clavin?
Oh, yes, and the ferret.
He was about to go on his route, and we shoved that angry ferret into his mailbag.
Oh, my.
Exactly how do you make a ferret angry?
Well, for starters, you shove him into a mailbag.
God, that was funny.
Do you remember the expression on his face?
Oh, no, I never saw his expression.
I was too busy looking at Mr. Clavin.
Woody, let me get you another cold one.
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, gosh, I tell you, this has just been the best evening.
My God, it's like reliving all my old days at Cheers, only without Lilith.
Boy, that's a trip to Bountiful, let me tell you.
These guys are really going through the beers, aren't they?
Oh, yes.
If this keeps up, you may have to fish out that emergency can you keep in the toilet tank.
Here you are, Woods.
Oh, well, you know what?
On second thought, I think I'm gonna pass.
I'm feeling a little bit jet-lagged.
- All right, you wanna call it a night?
- I probably should.
But this was so much fun.
I'd really like to do it again.
All right.
Well, how about lunch tomorrow?
- Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
- Okay.
- Hey, goodbye, y'all.
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.
Come back.
You know, Woody, there's a new gourmet Mexican restaurant down near your hotel I'd love to try.
It's called Dos Burros.
It sounds muy delicioso.
- I didn't know you speak Spanish.
- Oh, well I know that dos means "two".
What's burro mean?
Oh, same as in English.
Jackass.
Sorry, just asking.
- Hey, guys, how was lunch?
- Oh, great.
If we told one old story, we told a hundred.
- Hey, how are you doing, little guy?
- His name's Eddie.
Oh, Eddie.
Good for you, Mr. Crane.
They have good days and they have bad days.
Woody, here's that Seattle guidebook I was telling you about.
Right here.
- Oh, thanks.
- Get a load of that, huh?
Wow, look at that view.
You can see the whole city.
When you turn around it's even better.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
This is better.
No, no, no.
Look and see there - Hey, yeah, you mind if I go out there?
- No, no, you go ahead.
Hey, you remember that time we went out on the balcony at Melville's and threw pudding?
I don't think I ever laughed harder in my entire life.
- Put a bullet in my head.
- What's going on?
God, I have absolutely nothing in common with this man except things that happened 10 years ago.
I thought you had a fun time last night.
Well, yes.
We had exactly the same time this afternoon, and it wasn't nearly as fun.
The same stories and variations thereof.
Being forced to laugh over and over.
I swear, if I never get another shoulder noogie - I will die a happy man.
- Oh, don't feel bad.
You've been a good friend, you showed him a nice time, and now all that's left is for you to go in there and tell him goodbye.
Yes, I guess when all this is over I will have learned a very valuable lesson.
Sometimes, you can have too much of a good thing.
Got to know when to say when.
The past is just that, the past.
You can never go home again.
Less is more.
Wish you would have started with that last one.
Well, Woods, huh?
It's been great seeing you.
- Oh, yeah, hey - Come on, give me Give me a good hug, huh?
You gotta promise me you'll give my love to everybody back at the bar.
- Oh, I will.
- Okay.
And give that beautiful wife of yours and those two kids a big kiss from Uncle Frasier.
- You got it.
- And don't be a stranger, okay?
No, I won't.
I won't.
So where are we going for dinner tonight?
- Niles.
- Oh, Frasier.
Odd to see you without Woody in tow.
Is he off teasing ferrets?
Niles, listen, I've been having such a great time with Woody, I was hoping, maybe tonight you'd like to join us.
- We plan to go out - You can save it.
Dad brought me up to speed on your reunion of the damned.
- Oh, God.
- I would love to help.
- I'm sorry, you're on your own.
- No, no, please.
Really, I'm desperate.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to feign interest in the same old stories over and over again?
And you call yourself a psychiatrist?
You wouldn't last a week in private practice.
Speaking of which, my 6:00 is waiting.
- Triple espresso to go.
- Thank you.
Niles, please.
Please, I need you.
It's gonna be an excruciating journey into Oh, God Roz.
Say, you know, are you up for a night on the town?
This wouldn't be the invitation Niles just blew off, would it?
Oh, all right.
Here.
Please.
My old friend Woody's dragging me out again tonight.
I could really use a buffer.
He's taking me to some God-awful karaoke bar.
- Are you gonna sing?
- No.
- Okay, I'll go.
- Really?
You will?
I have a babysitter tonight.
My plans fell through.
- Karaoke might be fun.
- Karaoke, tonight?
Oh, I'd love to.
Well, Gil, I'm not sure you'd enjoy this Nonsense.
If we go to the one on Pike, I keep a locker there where I store my own microphone and show jackets.
- Hey, guys.
Hi, Roz.
- Oh, hi, Noel.
I see you're at our table.
"Our table"?
Oh, is there an office romance brewing?
No, Gil, we're just friends.
Right, Noel?
So far.
Well, who knows what the night has in store.
We're all going for karaoke.
Why don't you join us?
- Count me in.
- Is that my beeper?
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's the babysitter.
She calls in an emergency.
Gotta go, bye.
- Roz - Taxi!
- Roz, wait!
- Roz, wait!
Well, looks like it's just us boys.
- Oh, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.
You know, Niles, that was the first movie I ever took your mother to see.
I deliberately picked a tear-jerker so I'd be there to comfort her.
At the first sniffle I was on her like an octopus.
You men.
You always find a way to make us more vulnerable to your clumsy advances.
Oh, that wine went straight to my head.
Let's just kill off the bottle, shall we?
Hey, Fras.
- Turn off the music.
- Oh, well, we were just Dad, I never wanna hear music again.
Oh, I take it you had a whiz-bang time at the karaoke bar?
For starters, Woody sang "What Kind of Fool Am I"?
Which quickly turned into an audience-participation number.
Then Gil and Noel did a charming duet of "Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better".
They were both wrong.
I guess the highlight of the evening was when Gil, after one too many Kir Royales, performed a haunting rendition of "I Feel Pretty," during the latter verses of which Noel joined him on the apron of the stage and translated into Klingon.
Well, I think I'm just gonna go off to bed so I can get up bright and early for my harbour cruise with Woody tomorrow.
What?
You're seeing him again?
Why don't you just tell the guy you're busy for once?
But, Dad, he knows that I'm not.
Besides, I'd hate to hurt his feelings.
I'd hate to have him think that I've outgrown him.
- But you have.
- Well, that's the problem.
I've moved on to bigger and better things in my life.
He's still pouring drinks back at the same bar he's been at for the last 15 years.
- Don't you think that's kind of sad?
- If I were you, I'd just lie to him.
Tell him you have to work or you met a pretty girl.
Who's that pretty girl In the mirror there?
What mirror, where?
Who could that attractive girl be?
Which, what, where, whom?
Who?
- Daphne.
Daphne.
- Who?
Daphne!
Bedtime.
I used to be with the Light Opera Works.
Yes, fine.
And I used to be a fan dancer.
Get out.
Go to bed.
She seems a little wobbly.
- Perhaps I should - Niles.
Oh, surprise.
Guess who?
Dear God.
I just left him.
What moonlit, berry-picking expedition does he have planned for me now?
I can't take this anymore.
All right, all right, fine.
I'm just gonna have to lie to him.
- Woody.
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.
Listen, l When I got back to my hotel, I called Kelly to say good night and turns out our little girl has an ear infection, so I'm taking the redeye right now, and my cab is waiting for me downstairs.
Oh, well, Woody, I guess this means goodbye then.
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.
- Well, all right.
Give me a hug.
Remember to give my love to the folks back at Cheers.
- Oh, will do.
- Okay.
I hope that little girl of yours gets better real soon.
Thank you.
It was great spending time with you.
- It was great seeing you too, Woody.
- Yeah.
- It's a shame we have to cut it short.
- It sure is.
Goodbye.
- Have a good trip.
- Take care.
Bye-bye.
Good night, Woods.
God bless the virus that invaded that little girl's ear canal.
- Congratulations.
I'll be off.
- Oh, no, no, Niles.
Tell you what.
To celebrate my new-found freedom, we go over to that little cantina I mentioned earlier, and I'll buy you a late supper.
- We'll have a margarita.
- Oh, well, thank you, Frasier.
And after that, we'll go by that pricey new cigar club.
It's my treat.
Well, hey, big spender.
Is everything all right?
The last time I heard that phrase, Gil was belting it out while sitting on the lap of a Japanese businessman.
Let's get that margarita.
- Thank you.
- I think you're gonna like this place.
Well, I do already.
N.M.B. - N.M. B?
- No mariachi band.
Dear God.
Quick.
Hide your face with your menu.
- What?
- Woody's over there.
If he sees us, he'll know I lied.
- When did you lie?
- I told him I was going out of town.
No, you didn't.
He told you he was going out of town.
That's right.
He lied.
He should be hiding.
Woody.
Woody.
For God's sake.
Stay here.
Woody, come out of there, please.
I don't understand this.
It means, "I don't speak English".
Would you just come out here?
Woody, what is going on?
I can't even look at you, I'm so ashamed.
- I lied to you, Dr. Crane.
- Why did you do that?
Well, I guess I didn't want you to know it was me in the bathroom.
No, Woody.
Earlier this evening, you told me that you were going back to Boston.
Oh, well, I feel terrible saying this, but I just couldn't face another day of us hanging out together.
What, you weren't enjoying our time together?
Oh, you know, I had a great time that first night, but after that, I don't know, you were still having a good time, but it was less and less fun for me.
It's just too funny.
See, you're still having a good time and I'm miserable.
Why didn't you say something?
Well, I don't know.
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
To tell you the truth, I was I felt kind of bad for you.
You felt bad for me?
Well, no offence, but look at your life.
You live with your dad, you hang out with your brother.
You have no plans and Let's face it, those karaoke friends of yours, I wouldn't want to be stranded on a desert island with them.
Oh, well, maybe that English guy.
He was a good entertainer.
Really, Woody, there's nothing to worry about.
I know my life may seem rather dreary to you, but it's really quite enjoyable.
In fact, it's even a lot of fun.
I love my life now.
Honestly.
You know what?
I wouldn't trade my years at Cheers for anything, but I am very happy with my life the way it is today.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
That's what makes this conversation so ironic.
You see, you see my life as some sort of middle-age compromise and, well, just the other day I was thinking about your life.
- And all I could think was - What?
How lucky you are.
You see, you found where you belong, and you've made your home there.
I guess for some of us it just takes longer than others.
Well, I just stopped in for a beer Well, Niles will be on the phone for a couple more minutes.
Why don't we just have one last drink together?
- Well, that'd be nice.
- Okay.
Barkeep, couple of beers here, please.
You know, I meant what I said about I had a great time hanging out with you that first night.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Maybe we could do it again in five or 10 years.
Absolutely.
Ten years it is.
Cheers.
Cheers.

François, it's Niles Crane.
You delivered some champagne earlier for Valentine's Day.
Well, you brought over the '88, and I asked for the '85.
Yes, my date will know the difference.
She happens to be the president of our wine club.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes.
Remember, I won't be at home.
No, I'm not entertaining at the Shangri-la.
My brother was kind enough to let me use his apartment.
Well, what could I do?
I threw a blanket over it.
All right, now hurry, please, this woman is very particular.
Lucky for you, she loves dogs.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
All right, all right.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh, dear, oh.
- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.
Listen, I need your help.
Well, I don't have much time.
I'm on my way out.
Just answer me this.
How do you know if you're on a date?
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
Then you're not on a date.
That's very funny.
Listen, I'm in a restaurant waiting for Cassandra Stone, our new publicity director.
She asked me out for dinner this evening, and I was very flattered.
I think she's a terrific woman.
It's just, I'm starting to wonder if this is a business dinner or more of a romantic date.
You're going out to dinner on Valentine's Day.
It sounds like a date to me.
Yes, well, she didn't know it was Valentine's Day until I reminded her, and she did say she wanted to go over a new ad campaign.
Oh, come on.
Every time I see you two, she's got her hands all over you.
She has her hands all over everybody.
- She's a big flirt.
- That's true.
She flirted with me the first time I met her until I took off my baseball cap and parka.
Why don't you just ask her if it's a date?
Oh, Roz, I can't do that.
What if the answer is no?
For God's sakes, it'll be awkward all through dinner, awkward at work.
Imagine how embarrassing if it gets around the station.
I guess you're gonna have to play it by ear.
You'll know what she has in mind by the way she's dressed, how she acts, how she treats you.
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.
- Oh, there's my date.
- Who are you going out with tonight?
Oh, Bob, you know, the tax accountant.
Isn't he the one who drones on so incessantly, you call him "The Cricket"?
No, I call him "The Cricket" because he rubs his hands together really fast during sex.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Cassandra.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, well, that's all right.
I was just wondering if you'd changed your mind.
What, and pass up dinner with the sexiest man in radio?
Oh, well.
I, you know It's just so Our plans were so last-minute, I thought, you know, maybe I'd misunderstood.
My, things have certainly been clarified, haven't they?
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Of course.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
See that woman over there by the coat check?
- Yes.
- Yes, she's my dinner companion.
See, and things have taken a turn toward the romantic.
See, now, I want to make her feel as special as possible.
Then you should have offered to check her coat.
Yes, thank you very much.
All right.
Just play something romantic when she comes back.
Miss Cassandra, so nice to see you again.
You too, Mario.
And how's the sexiest maitre d' in Seattle?
Sorry again for keeping you waiting.
I got sucked in at this cocktail party.
Oh, you were at a cocktail party.
Some benefit thing.
It was very fancy.
Obviously.
Why else would I show up wearing this?
Why else indeed?
Oh, they have the best wine list here.
Do you feel like sharing a bottle?
If you like.
Good thing I took a cab here.
I'm a real lightweight.
Then again, I'm sure a gentleman like you wouldn't mind escorting me back to my room after dinner, will you?
Why, I think that could be arranged.
- I love the food here.
- What do you recommend?
I'll start with the anchovies and red peppers, and then the garlic chicken with scallions.
Are you in the mood for oysters?
Actually, I'm not sure.
Well, here we are.
Your hotel room.
Last stop.
Oh, come on in.
- Oh, thank you so much for this coat.
- Of course.
Oh, God, I can't believe we got caught in that rain storm.
- I'm freezing.
- Yes, me too.
I know something we can do to warm up really fast.
Yes, all we have to do is - Have a brandy.
- Yes!
Let's have a brandy.
- The mini-bar's right over there.
- Oh, great.
I'll be right out.
- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.
- Where are you?
- I'm in Cassandra's hotel room.
She invited me up here after dinner.
I'm just not sure what that means.
What it means?
It means even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while.
I'm still getting a lot of conflicting signals.
Maybe she just wants me up here to talk about business.
I just wish I could get one clear, unambiguous sign.
Oh, I just had to get out of that dress.
Here's your brandy.
I'll just go dry my hair.
Roz, I'm back.
Okay, she ditched her dress, and she's hitting the sauce.
What do you need, runway lights on the mattress?
Roz, it's not as clear-cut as it seems.
Look, Frasier, she is way out on a limb here.
You know how rejected she's gonna feel if you don't make a move?
- You're gonna blow it forever.
- Right.
You know what?
I'll take off my jacket.
Yeah, go get them, cowboy.
Frasier?
Are you making yourself comfortable?
Yes.
If it's okay, I still have a few questions about the ad campaign I'd like to ask you.
Well, that's why I'm here.
Or if you prefer, we could just talk about it over breakfast tomorrow.
Breakfast, you say?
I hope I wasn't being presumptuous.
We will be having breakfast together, won't we?
Absolutely.
Great.
So who else is gonna be there?
Where?
At the breakfast meeting.
The one for the sponsors here at the hotel tomorrow.
You just said you were going, right?
The meeting.
Of course.
Frasier.
What are you doing?
Well, I I thought you said you were gonna make yourself comfortable.
Why don't you check the closet?
I'm sure you'll find something in there you can slip on.
- All right.
- I'm just gonna take my lenses out.
You know, I'm really glad I asked you to dinner.
Gosh, so am I. You may not believe this, but I almost chickened out at the last minute.
It just goes to show, it's always better to take the risk.
Yes.
I mean, so you say no.
I'm an adult.
What's a little embarrassment?
I couldn't agree more.
Did you find the slippers?
What?
In the closet.
You stepped in that puddle after dinner.
I figured you might want to get out of those wet shoes and socks.
I mean, it's up to you.
I know some people feel funny about taking their shoes off in someone else's room.
My gosh, it's really starting to come down out there.
You know what I'm thinking?
No, I truly don't.
Well, it doesn't make much sense for you to drive home in this weather, especially since you are coming back for breakfast anyway.
Why don't you just stay over tonight?
All right.
When you say "stay over," you mean, of course Stay here.
Here?
Right.
Splendid.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just can't believe it's so late.
What are you sorry for?
Oh, just for keeping you up so late.
Oh, that's all right.
Aren't you coming to bed?
Oh, yes.
Coming to bed, yes.
Coming to this bed.
Well, would you mind turning the lights out?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all.
You know, Cassandra, I know this may sound like a silly question seeing as how we're in bed together, and nearly naked.
I've just been wondering, is this a romantic date or a business thing?
Cassandra?
Cassandra.
Roz, it's Frasier.
You know, Daph, I'm really impressed with you.
A lot of people get all insecure if they don't have a date on Valentine's Day, but not you.
Oh, heavens, no.
If you think about it, it's just a silly holiday they made up to sell more flowers and candy.
Right.
Well, you take a look at the menu, and I'll check your coat.
Oh, there's no need for that.
So, what looks good to you?
The coat check girl.
Give me your coat.
Happy Valentine's Day.
- Welcome to Russano's.
- Thank you.
The waiter will be by to take your drink order when your husband gets back.
Oh, he's not my husband.
I don't have a husband.
Wow, I wish there was something else I could check.
Besides my blood pressure.
Well, I know what I'm in the mood for.
A nice big steak.
How about you?
What happened?
Well, look around you.
Nothing but couples in love.
That's never gonna be me.
I'm just gonna wind up a dried-up old maid in a quilted bath robe with a smelly, deaf cat on my lap.
I thought you said you're okay with that.
- What?
- All right, Daph.
Come on, now.
Now, don't get upset.
Here, have a drink of water or something.
- Oh, I'm sorry about this.
- That's okay.
I don't know what came over me.
I haven't cried like this since, well, New Year's Eve.
Oh, jeez, come on, Daph.
You're, you know, you're gonna find someone.
- You think so?
- Well, sure.
Yeah, you're You have a lot of very great qualities.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry about this.
I know it makes you uncomfortable to talk about personal things.
Yeah, well, that's all right.
So you ready to order?
Oh, yeah.
What kind of qualities?
Well, you know, you're smart and nice-Iooking and fun to be with.
So you gonna go with the soup or salad?
- You really think I'm nice-Iooking?
- Well, sure, yeah.
Where's that guy with the bread?
That is so sweet of you.
Well, don't mention it.
Let's just have a nice, happy evening.
Of course.
I'm fine now.
- Nice-Iooking how?
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, never mind.
- Oh, no, it's all right.
Well, you know, you're pretty and tall.
And you take good care of your hair.
You know, you're attractive.
What do you want from me?
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't hear this sort of thing very much lately.
Well, you're just in a slump, that's all.
You ask me, you're a great catch.
It's not my place to say so, miss, but I think your father's right.
You're a very attractive woman.
Well, how about that?
- That's a nice little ego boost.
- Yeah.
Oh, I feel so silly all of a sudden, getting upset out of nowhere like that.
Well, I feel better now.
- Ready to share a nice big steak?
- Yeah, fine, whatever.
What's wrong with you?
Why did he assume I was your father?
I mean, a lot of guys my age go out with women like you.
What's he trying to say, that I can never attract someone young and pretty?
Well, thank you, Mr. Crane.
- Does this all have to be about you?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Well, you're a very attractive man with lots of wonderful qualities.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
All right, let's order.
Like what?
Oh, come on, now.
You're very charming, and you have a good sense of humour.
And you've got lovely eyes.
But most of all, you're good company.
I enjoy living with you.
Well, thank you, Daphne.
I like living with you too.
Thank you.
So why do you like living with me?
Oh, for God's sake!
Didn't we just agree to cut this out?
Oh, all right, all right.
You're wonderful.
I'm wonderful.
You know, it's funny when I think about the two of us.
I mean, sure, we have our little fights, but for the most part, we get along so well together.
And when I think about how I enjoy looking after you and how you always seem to miss me when I've been gone for too long, well, it's sort of like you're my What?
- No, it might sound funny to say it.
- Now, come on.
That's all right.
You can say it.
All right.
Well, it's sort of like you're my pet.
What?
Well, in a good sense.
Like you and Eddie.
What are you talking about?
Are you calling me a dog?
- It's an analogy!
- I can't believe it.
I take you out to buy you a nice meal, and you call me a dog!
- I give you a bath.
- I wish I ate as well as Eddie, I'll tell you that, instead of the slop you give me.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Thank you very much.
Well, Roz Oh, baby pictures?
Actually, these aren't the most flattering.
Oh, nonsense, Baby Alice couldn't possibly take a bad picture.
Oh, well, that's just adorable, the silly little one with the jam all over her face.
Well, actually, that's not jam, Frasier, it's baby eczema.
Oh, well, there's no need to worry about that.
That sort of thing is bound to clear up.
- Or spread.
- Just give them back.
Oh, hello, all.
- Oh, Niles.
- Baby pictures.
I don't really want anyone to look at those.
Well, I don't know why not.
Botticelli himself couldn't have painted a more perfect angel.
Well, thank you, Niles.
She is precious, isn't she?
I know.
Anyway, Niles, how did things go with Maris' lawyers?
Cappuccino, please.
Maris is determined to prolong my suffering.
She's asked to postpone our court date another eight months.
- Eight months?
- Yes.
Last night, I was in such a state, I wished I had a piano to crawl under.
What?
It's a habit I developed as a child to combat anxiety.
There's something about the safe, dark, protected environment.
- It seemed comforting to me.
- Yes.
The week before his first Little League tryout, he practically lived under there.
Well, we all did weird stuff when we were kids.
I know.
So, Niles, how did your lawyers respond to this postponement request?
Well, I can tell you they weren't very happy about it.
They got on the phone, raised some hell and got that postponement cut down to seven months.
Niles, are you serious?
You think maybe it's time that you consider getting some new lawyers?
Fire Harrison and Reid?
They're the top firm in Seattle.
But they're bleeding you dry.
They don't mind these postponements.
The longer they draw this out, the more money they'll get.
Oh, you know, I have the perfect person for you to call.
My old boyfriend, Donny.
He's a great lawyer.
No offence, Roz, but I highly doubt that your Donny is in the same league with Harrison and Reid.
Don't be so sure.
I mean, he's smart, he's tough.
He doesn't take no for an answer, not that I ever tested that theory.
Wait a minute, are we talking about Donny Douglas?
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.
Niles, I've read about this guy.
He's the one they call The Piranha.
Yeah, but that's because he has this night-grinding problem that makes his teeth really sharp and tiny.
Yes, well, anyway, Niles, I mean, this guy just won a huge case.
I mean, he might be just who you need.
I appreciate your concern, but, really, my situation is not as dire as you're making it out to be.
- What's that smell?
- What smell?
The one coming out of your briefcase.
Oh, I don't smell anything.
Oh, my God, is this your lunch?
A bologna sandwich?
And a fruit cocktail?
Oh, Niles, do you see what these lawyers have reduced you to?
Do you have any idea what they're having for lunch?
I don't know.
They don't itemise, they just bill me for the total.
Donny should be here any minute.
Make yourselves comfortable.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Frasier, you really don't have to stay.
Well, I didn't have to come at all, but if I hadn't, you never would have.
Well, the office seems nice enough.
Might have overdone it on the plants a little.
Yes, it's excess like this that's destroying the plastic rain forest.
Niles.
University of Las Vegas.
No problem finding tassels for those mortarboards.
Will you stop being such a snob?
Give this man a chance, for God's sake.
And, please, will you have a mint?
I'm halfway across the room, all I can smell is bologna.
Hey.
How you doing?
Donny Douglas.
- How are you?
Who's who?
- Mr. Douglas, I'm Frasier Crane.
- This is Niles.
- You're Niles.
- Frasier Crane?
- Yes.
- You're Roz's buddy, aren't you?
- Yes, yes.
You gotta do me a favour, okay?
Tell Roz, finally, I had my teeth capped.
See?
Look.
- Oh, yes.
Well, I'll tell her.
- You promise you won't forget?
- Oh, not much danger of that.
- Okay.
Now, I gotta be in court in about 20 minutes, so sit down, let's get started.
Well, as we discussed on the phone Maria, get me my grey suit for court.
Come on, come on, come on.
Maris is determined to exhaust my already strained financial resources.
- And the real injustice - Yeah.
And, Maria, could you just cancel that 4:00 of mine?
And would you also put Joe Silva on my call sheet?
I'm listening, I'm listening.
Come on.
Well, Maris has no right to be angry with me.
Maria, you're the best.
Thank you so much.
Cool.
What?
What?
Come on, let's go.
What?
- I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.
- Oh, don't worry.
Maria has that effect on men all the time.
Niles, I think you were about to tell Mr. Douglas about Dr. Schenkman.
Right.
Well, last year, Maris and I were actually making progress in couples therapy, when, to my dismay, I discovered that she and our therapist were - Oh, my God.
- That's right, they were This is the best corned beef I have ever tasted.
You've gotta have a bite of this.
Here.
- Come on, it's got spicy mustard.
- No, thanks.
- How about you?
- Sorry, mustard allergy.
Mr. Douglas, maybe we'll come back when you have more time.
No, no, no.
I got the gist.
Your wife was doing your shrink.
Now she's trying to bleed you with a long pre-trial, I get it.
- Who's her lawyer?
- Lockhart and Whalen.
- Maria, get me Lockhart.
Or Whalen.
- Wait, wait, wait, you're calling them?
Yeah, listen, could we just cut through the formalities here?
Okay.
Niles, what you need is a guy like me representing you.
What you're in here is a street fight, and you gotta know who's covering your back.
So, what I guarantee you is this: You will never see me unprepared, you'll never see me intimidated, and you will never, ever see me throw in the towel.
- Understand?
- I'd certainly hope not.
- I've got Geoff Whalen on line one.
- Okay, thank you.
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes.
Whalen, Donny Douglas here.
I'm calling about Niles Crane.
Yeah.
I can't possibly let this man represent me.
I'll be humiliated.
Niles, you have got to hear this man out.
I'm sorry, this is exactly what you want in a lawyer, someone who's not afraid to show moxie.
He's an inch away from showing us the full moxie.
You're gonna get hit with a countersuit for an infliction of pain and distress.
You don't think I can win?
You call York and McFadden, you see what those bastards had to pay for trying to pull this same crap on a client of mine.
Yeah, we're talking big numbers here, Whalen.
You haven't seen so many zeros lined up since Mr. Spock had a book signing.
Yeah.
You gotta hear this.
Come here, come here.
Well, yes, of course, it's important to be reasonable.
I'm sure we can move a few things around and be ready for court by about next month.
- Mr. Douglas?
- Yeah?
Does this mean you're now representing Niles Crane?
That's exactly what that means.
And, Whalen, I'll be in touch about a discovery schedule.
Have a nice day.
- Mr. Douglas, that was brilliant.
- Yes.
My goodness, almost makes me wish I was still married to Lilith.
Now, we're probably gonna get rolling sometime this week with depositions.
So, you know, pick a day, we'll get together, I will prepare you, but it's gonna be very low-key, casual, over dinner or something.
- You're due in court in ten minutes.
- Okay.
- And, Donny?
- Yeah?
Mustard.
Jeez, was that there the whole time?
That's so embarrassing.
And, indeed, I had high hopes for Niles and Maris, as is witnessed by my wedding toast, in which I combined my heartfelt sentiments with apt quotations from Shakespeare, jazz great Louis Armstrong and the poet Catullus.
And so your answer would be, "Yes, I attended their wedding"?
Once again, Frasier, could you try to keep your answers brief?
- Well, l - Trust me, he did.
All right, all right, look, I'll try to do better.
I still don't understand why they're deposing Frasier before Niles.
They like to question friends and family first so they get as much information as they can to try to catch Niles in a lie.
They're also gonna allege that during the separation, Niles was wasteful with money.
She's calling me wasteful?
Do you recall what she used to do when our dogs needed a shampoo?
Yes, she'd fill the bathtub with Evian.
Half the time, she'd just get a new dog.
Anyway, look, Frasier, they might ask you if you witnessed any examples of Niles throwing money around.
And your answer would be?
- Yes.
- No, no, no.
The answer is, "Not to the best of my recollection".
- But I do recall, and I'll be under oath.
- Oh, please, not this again.
As you figured out, Frasier is a bit of a stickler when it comes to his ethics, and I applaud him for it.
- Oh, great.
- More coffee, anyone?
No, thank you, Daphne.
I think I'm just about done here.
In fact, I've got a conference call back at the office.
I'm gonna check to see if that's still happening.
Why don't you see if there's questions we haven't done yet?
- All right?
- Oh, all right, all right.
No, we've done those, all right.
Oh, here's one: "Can you recall a specific incident where Maris lost her temper or behaved in a way you'd characterise as volatile or unstable"?
You're kidding.
No Well, based on what?
Oh, please.
- Something wrong?
- No, it's okay.
No, thank you, thank you, Maria, no.
Maris' lawyers, they kill me.
All week long, it's been one desperate ploy after another.
- This is the best one yet.
- What is it?
Oh, now they're claiming alienation of affection.
You're kidding me.
After what she did?
Now they're saying that during the marriage, Niles was in love with another woman.
- Who?
- Oh, you.
- Me?
- Dear God.
That's absurd.
Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?
Well Not to the best of my recollection.
Why on earth would they think Dr. Crane's in love with me?
Oh, something about a country-club ball the two of you attended a few years back.
- This is all based on that?
- Yeah.
You caused quite a stir on the dance floor or something.
Yeah, we were just putting on a show for his snobby friends.
You must have been convincing, because they're gonna subpoena you for deposition.
We can call their bluff right away, you can come tomorrow with Frasier.
- Fine by me.
- Okay, great.
Now, I'm gonna have to prepare you for this because lawyers, they can twist your words around.
They get a judge to buy it, because of the prenup, Maris can really stick it to Niles.
- But I got this conference call - Well, I could come with you.
- We'll get it done in an hour.
- Just let me grab me coat.
Don't you worry, Dr. Crane.
Now, Frasier, I hope you realise they're gonna ask you about this business too.
- Me?
- Yes, but don't worry.
This is one time when your compulsive truth-telling won't get us into any trouble.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Well, that's it.
It's over.
It's over, and I've lost.
- Maris has won.
Maris always wins.
- Niles.
Niles never wins.
Niles always loses.
That's why Niles lives at the Shangri-la and drives a hatchback.
Niles, now, get a grip.
Maris' people are just fishing.
We're the only ones who know how you feel about Daphne.
Today.
Tomorrow, everyone will know, including Daphne.
This is how she's gonna find out.
I wanted to whisper it to her over a candlelight dinner, not have it read back to her by a court stenographer.
What are you talking about?
Frasier's not gonna tell.
He'll be under oath.
What if they ask him?
Well, he'll just say no.
Right, Fras?
- Fras?
- Well, it's not that simple.
You heard what he said, I'll be under oath.
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Niles.
Here.
Put your head between your legs.
I'll get you some water.
You'll be all right.
Just take a couple of deep breaths.
If I could take deep breaths, it would mean I could breathe.
You're not gonna go and blow this for him, are you?
There's nothing I'd like to do more than help my brother.
I'd like to do it without violating my ethics.
But Maris is responsible for this divorce.
Niles' feelings for Daphne has nothing to do with it.
Now, if you cover for Niles, you won't be doing anything wrong.
Dad, we are talking about perjury.
When is that ever acceptable?
Oh, you want an example?
Fine.
Let's say, what if there was a comet hurtling towards the Earth.
For God's sake.
You could save Earth, but the only way you could do it is by lying under oath.
Would you do it then?
- Who am I lying to, the comet?
- Oh, just answer the question.
All right, I suppose that in certain extreme cases So then you'd lie?
To save mankind from a talking comet, yes.
But you won't lie for Niles?
You make me sound like some insensitive lout who isn't aware that my brother's out there in pain.
Isn't that Niles' water?
I'm just checking to see it's not too cold.
Niles?
- Niles?
- I'm over here.
The piano.
Niles.
Please, please, just come out from under there.
- Things are not that bad.
- Not that bad?
Daphne is going to find out about this.
Not if you crawl out before she gets home.
Niles, please, come out here.
Now, come on.
Why should I?
There's nothing for me out there.
It's all lawyers and ex-wives and broken hearts.
All I have to contend with under here is a couple of dust bunnies.
A few cobwebs.
Some kind of a nest.
Dear God, doesn't your vacuum come with any attachments?
All right, just sit tight and I'll get you a wet cloth.
Look what you've done.
I hope you're happy now.
Do you really wanna see me lying under oath?
It's better than seeing your brother lying under a piano.
I can't believe you're being casual about this.
Do you realise you're asking me to do something unethical?
For God's sake, nobody's even gonna know.
Yes, but that's the point.
Ethics are what we do when no one else is looking.
For heaven's sake, I learned that from you.
Are you saying you wouldn't have trouble with this?
- Niles, here.
- Thank you.
Let me tell you something.
One time, when I was on the force, I saw a guy shoot somebody.
When we caught him, I started to read him his rights, but he slipped out of his cuffs and swung at me, so I didn't finish.
Two months later, I'm on the stand and his lawyer asks me if I read him his rights in full.
Now, if I say no, this guy walks.
And this guy's been in and out of jail all his life.
He could have read me his rights.
So I say: "Yes, I did, I read them in full".
I lied under oath.
Now, you might think that I did an unethical thing, but there's not a doubt in my mind that I did the right thing.
Well, Dad, I'm still not sure what I'm gonna do.
Why do you have to make everything so complicated?
I don't know.
But I'm never gonna figure out anything with you barking in my ear.
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.
Oh, yeah, yeah, run away, just like you always do.
Boy, I sometimes don't understand your brother.
I guess some of us can deal with a tough situation head-on, and others just need an escape.
Dr. Crane, they'll be ready for you in just a few minutes.
Thank you.
- Frasier.
Hi.
Have you?
- Oh, Niles.
No, not yet.
Daphne's still in the conference room.
The place is slithering with Maris' lawyers.
Oh, yes.
Never a mongoose around when you need one.
Listen, I'm sorry I ever put you in this position.
Niles, it's not your fault.
No, listen, I thought a lot about this last night, and I realised the way I was carrying on yesterday was just making it harder for you to do whatever you feel is the right thing.
I'm still not really sure what the right thing is.
Well, if it makes any difference, I've decided to tell Donny everything about Daphne.
- Really?
- Yes.
- He can proceed however he sees fit.
- But why, Niles?
Well, I started to wonder, maybe my feelings for Daphne did affect my marriage.
Maybe on some intuitive level, Maris knew all along.
I can't be certain that's not what drove her to Schenkman.
Listen to me.
The only reason that marriage lasted as long as it did was because of the effort that you put into it, from the moment you slipped that ring onto her bony finger and it slipped right off again.
There is no way that this divorce is your fault.
- I wish I could be sure of that.
- Okay, Frasier Oh, Niles.
Good.
Frasier, they're just about ready for you.
Wait for me outside the conference room.
And don't go in without me.
I want a word alone with your brother here.
Right.
Wish there was something I could do, Niles.
Well, there is.
When you go home this afternoon, leave a bottle of sherry under the piano.
Wait for me.
Okay.
Glad you're here.
There's something I wanna talk to you about.
- Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
- No, me first.
Now, the only way this relationship is gonna work, Niles, is if we're completely honest with each other.
- I agree.
- I've been digging.
I found out you've been holding out on me.
Yes, and I'm very sorry about that.
You didn't tell me where Maris' money came from.
It's never easy - Maris' money?
- Yeah.
I mean, you told me that Maris' family money came from timber.
It did.
It did come from timber.
- Oh, that's what you really think.
- Well, of course, it's true.
And that's what all of Maris' friends think too?
All those country-club snobs who would kill for a good piece of dirt on someone?
What are you talking about?
If her family money didn't come from timber, where did it come from?
Urinal cakes?
I don't believe this.
All these years, the doyenne of Seattle's elite looking down her nose at everyone in sight, she owes it all to this.
She's managed to have her urinal cake and eat it too.
Yes, I think we now have what's known in the legal profession as a bargaining chip.
Are you kidding?
She'd give anything to keep this quiet.
All right, let me go talk to Maris' lawyers.
No, no, no, there's some news you want to deliver yourself.
- May I?
- Absolutely.
Hello, Marta.
Like to speak to Maris.
Oh, why not?
She's in the final level of her guru serenity training, the weeklong vow of silence, day six.
No, that's all right.
She doesn't have to come to the phone.
Just give her this message: I've flushed out her family secret.
Hello, Maris.
I can't remember the last time I felt this way.
The air is sweeter, colours are brighter.
It's as if my very senses have come alive.
It makes perfect sense.
You've just won your life back.
Frasier, watch this.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Today's special blend, Jamaican Blue Mountain.
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, Niles, that was very good.
That's my favourite.
Well done.
The beans were gathered on the shady side of the northern slope Don't push it.
I still can't believe this is all over.
And I never dreamed I'd get a settlement like that.
I'll be able to get my whole life back, my apartment, my car.
I owe it all to one amazing man.
Well, thank you, Niles, but I can't take all the credit.
I know, you're thinking of Donny.
Well, don't think I'm not grateful for all you did.
To tell the truth, if it hadn't been for me badgering you to change your lawyers, Donny Douglas never would've come into your life.
Of course, we mustn't forget Roz's part in all of this.
Waiter.
Who understands why anything happens?
I mean, it's remarkable how completely one's life can change in an instant.
Oh, Niles.
Hi, you two.
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi.
Hi, how are you doing?
Oh, congratulations, Dr. Crane.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you, Daphne.
What are you two doing here together?
Oh, well, you know, we were talking, we got a little hungry, and then we drank a little bit too much wine, and we laughed a little too much.
Listen to us, we sound like an old married couple.
I know.
You know, Frasier, if you hadn't brought Niles to the office, then none of this would have happened.
I guess I owe you one.
Well, now, we mustn't forget Roz's part in all of this.
That scent is wonderful.
What is that?
Cherry bark and almonds.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- Hello.
- Hey, how was your afternoon?
Do you know what this wonderful man did?
Oh, Daphne, please don't He filled a basket full of me favourite English foods: Blood pudding, jellied eels, kidney pie.
Then he hid it in the shrubs so we'd stumble upon it during our stroll through the park.
I was afraid that somebody would find it before we got there, but fortunately, untouched.
Yes.
Just because it was untouched doesn't mean someone didn't find it.
- Hello, Dr. Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.
Donny.
Hey, tiger.
Look what I got for you.
Think fast.
- What are the keys to?
- Your ex-wife's lakefront cottage.
Now your lakefront cottage.
A little something I hammered out for you in the settlement.
Thank you.
Donny, I never thought I'd see Shady Glen again.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Well, congratulations, Niles.
Yeah, looks like Donny really did a job on Maris' legal team.
Yes, well, he certainly is ruthless, all right.
As a divorce lawyer, what a callous attitude he must have toward human relationships.
Yeah, you'd think so, Dr. Crane, but actually, it's just the opposite.
I've never met anyone so incredibly romantic.
Yes, well, I'm sure he seems that way on the outside.
Oh, Niles, please.
It's unseemly enough when she's actually in the room.
I'm sorry.
What am I supposed to do?
For the first time since I've known her, I'm free and single and now she's with someone.
- I'm supposed to suffer in silence?
- I'd take that.
I just don't understand.
What does she see in him?
If you were Daphne, would you go out with Donny?
Well, no, but I wouldn't massage Dad's ass for what I pay her either.
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.
Donny and Daphne seem very happy together.
Either it's true love, in which case it's too late for you to declare yourself, or it's just a temporary infatuation.
- It's got to be.
It's got to be.
- In which case, it will pass.
And then you can make your move.
In the meantime, I suggest that maybe you start looking elsewhere.
You know, maybe make a fresh start.
Do something to get your mind off of Daphne.
I know, I know, it's just difficult.
Yes, I understand.
Say, you know what?
I've got an idea.
Why don't the three of us go to that cabin of yours for the weekend?
Sorry, I can't.
I got a dentist appointment Saturday morning.
Niles can go up on Friday night, put things together, and then you and I can drive up on Saturday afternoon.
Why not?
It's a fabulous place, Dad.
It's got a stereo and a big-screen TV and a sauna, wine cellar.
Perfect for three guys roughing it in the wilderness.
Well, I'm game.
I can stop at the butcher, pick up a couple of ducks and make my justly celebrated duck à I'orange.
Washed down with a winsome-yet-robust Chambertin.
- Chambertin.
- Yeah.
I'll bring a quart of whisky in case of snakebite.
Dad, Dad, there are no snakes up there.
All right, I'll bring a snake.
God, this is great, Niles.
I've gotta dash down to the mailbox, drop that letter in before the last pick-up.
Niles, trust me.
You'll be glad you took my advice on this one.
I already am.
Thank you.
It's going to do me a world of good to get away from Daphne for a while.
Yes, I couldn't agree more.
Hey, Daphne, how would you like to see my new lakefront cottage?
- Sounds lovely.
When?
- This weekend.
We're all going.
You can drive with me on Friday and Dad and Frasier will be right behind.
Oh, that's very sweet, Dr. Crane.
But I can't.
One of me cousins is going to San Francisco this weekend and I promised I'd fly down.
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.
Donny's not too thrilled about it either.
- He wanted to come with me.
- And he's not?
No, that would have meant staying in a hotel together, and I'm not sure we're ready for that yet.
I suppose you think I'm being a bit old-fashioned.
Dear God in heaven, no.
You can't force these things.
You have to wait for the moment when you know it's right.
And sometimes the moment never comes and you just have to move on.
I really appreciate the invitation and I hope you'll invite me again.
All right, Daphne, how would you like to see my new lakefront cottage?
You're silly.
- Martin, Niles.
- Hey.
- Boy, this place is jammed.
- Here, Roz, you can have my seat.
- I'm on my way to Duke's.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
So how's the world treating you?
Like dirt.
My social life is non-existent.
Every time I meet a guy who's halfway decent, all I have to do is mention I got a kid and he runs like a cheap pair of pantyhose.
Well, maybe you and Niles can cheer each other up.
- Dad.
- Why, what's his problem?
Daphne's got a new boyfriend and it's eating him up.
- Dad.
- What?
You got a thing for Daphne?
You didn't know that after all these years?
No, I can't believe Daphne never told me.
How could she?
She doesn't know either.
- You're kidding.
- Yes.
Yes, he's a great kidder.
Now, you, Dad, run along and you be very careful crossing streets.
Six years, can you believe it?
Some people just don't even know when it's time to pull the plug.
Well, I won't make that mistake twice.
So let me get this straight.
You've been hot for Daphne all this time and you've never made a move?
- I was a happily married man.
- You were never happy.
And you've been separated for almost two years.
Well, somehow, the right moment never came along.
Oh, come on.
I'm not trying to make you feel bad, it's just, waiting all this time, and now she's got a boyfriend.
My God, that is really pathetic.
Obviously, you've never let someone you've grown to care deeply about get away.
Well, sure I have.
I'm not talking about when the migrant workers leave at the end of the picking season.
No, really.
I've had a couple of boyfriends I shouldn't have let get away.
- Serious relationships?
- Yeah.
I can name one right off the top of my head.
That lawyer I gave you, Donny.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I mean, you only know him professionally, but he's very funny, warm, thoughtful.
We were together for about six months, but he really wanted a family and I wasn't ready so I dumped him.
Now I have the family, but no Donny.
Gee, I wonder who he's seeing these days.
- What's so funny?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
I just want to savour it.
You've been having all the fun.
So tell me.
Donny is Daphne's boyfriend.
That's not funny.
When did this happen?
Well, she met him when he was working on my case.
Wow, and I was calling you a loser.
- You never called me a loser.
- In my head I did.
Well, at the moment, I have to agree with you.
I've had plenty of opportunities and I always chickened out.
Don't blame yourself.
She's living with your brother, working for your dad.
- It's an awkward situation.
- It is.
Well, don't feel bad about Donny.
It wasn't right for you at the time, that's nobody's fault.
Thanks, Niles.
Listen, the next time you find somebody you like, don't wait so long to tell her.
I've got a babysitter waiting.
Mrs. Hines is 70 years old, has a mole like Abe Lincoln, but I bet she has plans for the weekend.
You know what?
I just had the craziest idea.
My settlement with Maris includes a beautiful lakefront cottage, and I'm going up there this afternoon.
Why don't you come along?
You can bring Alice.
Are you serious?
Well, Frasier and Dad are coming up tomorrow.
But tonight, it'd just be us.
Love's losers, licking our wounds, laughing at our pain.
Gee, I don't know, l Frasier's making duck à I'orange and I'm bringing the wine.
What about it?
I never thought I'd say this, but you're on.
In a funny way, this reminds me of that wonderful moment in Streetcar Named Desire when the brutish Stanley says to the ultra-refined Blanche: "We've had this date with each other from the beginning".
I don't know the play well, but I can tell you right now, I'm not that refined.
Actually, I was picturing you more as Stanley.
- Hi there.
- Donny, so glad you could make it.
Well, thanks for inviting me.
This is a great place to get some work done.
And no distractions in sight.
- Thank - Donny, I'd like to introduce Oh, that's right.
You two know each other, don't you?
- Roz, how the hell are you?
Hi.
- Donny.
I didn't know you were gonna be here.
This is gonna be fun.
I gotta put these somewhere.
Where do I go?
- Just in one of the bedrooms upstairs.
- Okay.
But be careful not to wake Roz's baby.
She's in that first room.
Roz, you've got a baby?
Congratulations.
That means that you're Married?
Nope.
She's free as a bird.
Well, I'll try to be quiet.
- What the hell is this?
- What do you mean?
I thought you might enjoy reminiscing about all the good times you shared.
Oh, no, you don't.
Donny is seeing Daphne, and I am not the kind who steals other people's boyfriends.
Not friends' boyfriends, not good friends.
Not again.
Roz, you might recall you went out with him for six months.
She's only seen him three or four times.
- They're not even sleeping together.
- What?
How would you know?
She told me.
I don't wanna be the bad guy here, but you did have him first.
And he did wanna make a life with you.
Listen, there is no way that I am going She hasn't slept with him?
She's English.
Why don't you just admit it?
You're just doing this because you want Daphne.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I want Daphne.
I think we belong together, just like I think you and Donny belong together.
And why should two people be happy when four people can be ecstatic?
Well, you got a point there.
No.
No, no, no, it's just not right.
Roz, I swear I did not wake her.
She was already up when I went in to look at her.
She's got such a sweet little face.
- Her name is Alice.
- Hi, Alice, I'm Donny.
She doesn't usually let strangers hold her.
I've always been pretty good with kids.
Come on, sweetie, come on.
How's my hair?
- Niles.
- Hey.
Frasier, Dad.
What are you doing here today?
Oh, my dentist is sick.
We had to reschedule.
- Oh, no.
- It's just a head cold.
Oh, God, you haven't even heard the worst yet.
Butcher shop was closed, so here I am with my spices and everything I need to make my duck à I'orange, all I've got is the I'orange.
We're gonna have to get ducks the old-fashioned way, but there's only a couple of hours of daylight left.
Yes.
You know, I saw some boxes of ammo in the mudroom.
- Through the kitchen.
- No, Dad.
Are you insane?
I'm not gonna shoot any ducks.
It's barbaric.
You'll eat them but you won't kill them.
What do you think, these things are born à I'orange?
Dad does have a point.
There is a duck blind across the lake.
It would be a good opportunity for you two to bond.
- Niles, what about you?
- I will stay here and season the pans.
- I'm not going hunting.
- Then drive back to Seattle, find another shop that's open, and come back tomorrow.
What's going on?
You trying to get rid of us?
- That's preposterous.
Why should l?
- Frasier, Martin.
You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow.
- Roz, what are you doing here?
- Niles brought me.
I'm just gonna go heat up a bottle for Alice.
- Roz?
- Roz.
Roz.
Yes, so why don't you two run along and leave me alone with Roz?
Roz?
Well, didn't you urge me to make a fresh start?
True, but I gotta tell you, Roz isn't the freshest start you could make.
Now, butt out, Frasier.
If these two wanna be alone together, that's fine.
- Now, we're gonna go hunting.
- I'm not going hunting, Dad.
Roz and Niles?
Please, you guys have nothing in common.
Frasier, we're not getting married.
We're going to spend an afternoon together.
There's nothing wrong with trying something different.
Which is what you're gonna do now.
So come on, let's go get some ducks.
- Dad - Please, take as long as you need.
- I don't wanna go hunting.
- Oh, come on.
Didn't you ever hear the expression "two's company, three's a crowd"?
No, Dad, I don't think I ever did.
How does it go?
I left some papers in the car.
- Where'd you park?
- Out back.
Then it's best to go through the kitchen because we have a loose plank on the porch.
I already came in that way.
Well, you cheated death once.
Don't push your luck.
Niles, one last warning.
Take it from someone who knows you both.
You and Roz are not a good couple.
I understand your saying that, but believe me, I have seen a new Roz and underneath that brazen exterior, she is a sweet, sensitive, shy, vulnerable woman.
Niles?
Have you seen my nipples?
No.
- Niles and Roz?
It's just ridiculous.
- Oh, not this again.
Well, they are just completely incompatible.
Well, haven't you ever heard about opposites attracting?
I mean, look at your mother and me.
We went together six months, nobody thought it'd last.
We had 40 happy years together.
- Never thought of it that way.
- Yeah.
And then, there are those relationships where people have a ton of things in common, and of course, they always work out real well.
I suppose that was a backhanded comment about me and Lilith.
Wouldn't it be great if she was flying by here on her broomstick right now?
- Come on, sight up.
- No.
No, I told you, I'm not shooting anything.
- All right, blow the duck call.
- Well, all right.
Gee, you know, I keep thinking about you and Mom.
Maybe Niles and Roz do have a chance.
Well, sure they do.
Blow it again.
You know, I hope I didn't discourage Niles too much by the way I reacted.
You know how much stock he puts in my opinion.
Blow it, Frasier.
I didn't mean the duck call.
What about that time in Cancún when the car breaks down and that guy gives us a ride on his donkey.
Niles, you have to hear this.
Oh, God, I didn't realise it'd gotten so late.
I have to fax these contracts to the office right away.
You wouldn't happen to have a machine?
There's one in the study right down that hall.
But can't that wait?
We're all getting so mellow here.
You're right.
It can wait.
You know what we need?
Another bottle of wine and I brought one.
I'll get it.
Excellent, excellent.
- Well, it's going well, don't you think?
- Yeah.
Except your dad and Frasier will be here any minute.
And if either one of them sees Donny, things are over.
They're not gonna.
You're gonna invite him to watch the sunset by the lake.
You're gonna work your charms on him, then you're going to invite him out to dinner, and who knows where that'll lead.
What am I saying?
We both know where that'll lead.
- You really think it'll work?
- Yes, yes, yes.
You go there, you enjoy that romantic sunset.
- I'll stay with the baby.
- Okay.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
You're not gonna let her go and enjoy the sunset by herself?
Frasier, what are you doing back so soon?
I came back for some more ammo.
Who knew ducks were so shifty?
Anyway, listen.
I know that you took my advice to heart, but I tell you, I've changed my mind.
I now approve of you and Roz.
- What?
- Yes, the two of you should go for it.
Okay, come on.
Off you two go, let's go.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- Why not?
I've changed my mind.
I'd rather stay here.
What?
You know what?
You guys are putting far too much stock in my opinion.
Come on, let's get down to the lake and enjoy that sunset.
- But l - Let's go.
No, not another word.
Down to the lake.
Okay.
I've got a Alice.
It's okay, honey.
You wait here.
I'll get Donny.
You know, Roz is heading down to the lake to catch that sunset.
And you should be going with her too.
For God's sakes, I told the two of you, I withdraw my objection.
Now, come on, let's go.
I'm worried about leaving Alice alone.
Now, Roz, listen, I will attend to the baby.
I was about to make myself a cup of tea.
Now, come on, let's go.
March.
Both of you, out the door.
You'll enjoy that romantic sunset if I have to drag you down there myself.
Oh, okay.
Good lord, I just can't believe the two of them.
Ridiculous behaviour.
My God.
- Daphne!
- Sorry.
- Did I startle you?
- No, no, no, that's quite all right.
It's just that if Niles knew you were here, he would never Well, forgive himself for not being here to greet you.
He wasn't expecting me.
Me plans changed and I thought I'd drive up and join you all.
Well, isn't that nice?
You've got to leave.
- Why?
- No, well, you see, Niles is up here for what a I think you Brits call a dirty weekend with someone.
And the someone happens to be Roz.
Roz?
You mean, "Roz" Roz.
Yes, yes.
You've gotta get out of here.
But I just drove two hours and it's getting dark outside.
All right, I'll tell you what.
There's a bed-and-breakfast up the road.
I think Dad, you and I should stay there this evening.
- All right.
- Great.
- Could I use the bathroom first?
- No, no, of course.
Right in there.
Dear God.
Where's Donny?
He can't be in the kitchen.
Frasier would've seen him.
Look, the door.
He must be up there.
- You keep a look out.
I'll go get him.
- Okay.
Why don't I take over here and you can join Roz?
For the love of God.
If I'd known you would take my words seriously, I would've chosen them more carefully.
For God's sakes, get out of here.
Get down to that lake.
Fellas, I really think I should check on Alice.
No, no, Roz, your baby is just fine.
I burped her once and she went out like a light.
Come on.
Let's go, Niles.
Oh, you know, I am thinking about it.
I think it's much more romantic to stay here by the fire than watch some sunset.
Why don't you clear out so we can have our privacy?
Well, all right.
On the other hand You know, you can enjoy the fire all night long.
You've only got ten more minutes for the sunset.
You gonna get ammo while it's daylight?
- It's almost sunset.
- Don't tell me, tell them.
- Is that the bathroom?
- No.
- Yes, it is.
- It's out of order.
Let me check again.
My God.
One of the pipes has burst and the other one's knocking.
Fine, is there one down the hallway there?
- No.
- Yes, there is.
No, it's out of order too.
Well, it's a good thing I brought all that beer.
You know, Niles, you're behaving awfully strangely.
- What the heck is going on?
- What do you mean?
I mean that you show absolutely no desire to be alone with Roz.
Starting to have serious doubts about this so-called romance.
Oh, really?
Well, does this look "so-called" to you?
Come here, pookie.
That's why the door was stuck.
You two, why didn't you tell me?
- Donny.
- Donny?
Daphne.
- Daphne.
- What are you doing here?
Well, Niles invited me.
Oh, did he?
It was nice.
Roz and I had a chance to catch up on old times.
Yeah, that's right.
You two used to date, didn't you?
Well, isn't that nice of Niles to organise this little reunion?
I hope I don't have anything to worry about.
Oh, come on, are you kidding?
Well, obviously, Roz and Niles can barely keep their hands off each other.
You know, why don't all of us get out of here?
Give these two little kids a little privacy.
You know, we could use some privacy of our own.
Dr. Crane tells me there's a bed-and-breakfast up the road from here.
- Really?
- Really.
- Even more fun if we both go.
- Yes, yes.
Bye.
Well, come on, Frasier.
Let's go get a nice sloppy joe.
I'll pay for it.
Something tells me I'll pay for it too.
I realise now that you two don't need my blessing so I'll just leave you with this:
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
You know, Niles, I think I'm going to have a dinner party.
You care to co-host?
What a lovely idea.
What's the occasion?
Actually, I got the idea last night when we bumped into Gene and Hollis Ashby at the symphony.
I want to get to know them better.
Me too.
They're such a charming couple.
They remind me of Maris and me when we were happy.
Really?
I must have been sick that day.
- Oh, well, Roz.
- Thank you.
- Is that your dry cleaning?
- No, it's Daphne's.
Alice spit up on her dress so I had to have it dry-cleaned for her.
I also had to buy her a new pair of shoes and detail her car.
I've never seen a kid so sick.
Hey, Roz.
You look gorgeous.
Thanks.
How much time do we have?
- Twenty minutes.
I better get changed.
- Where are you going?
Daphne has friends at the British Consulate.
They're having a big reception and she got us invitations.
Who knows?
Maybe you'll meet some English lord who'll make you a lady.
I think at this point it would take the actual Lord to make her a lady.
Well, let's pick a date for our party.
You've got your book?
Let's see.
- The first is no good.
- No, wine club.
- Nor the second.
- Library fund-raiser.
- The third, no.
- Fourth, fifth or sixth?
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
- Oh, what about the 11th?
- No, concert tickets.
- Oh, really?
I don't have that marked.
- Yes, I'm taking a date.
Well, isn't that nice?
The 11th, "Expect desperate, last-minute call from F." - Anything the next week?
- No.
No.
- I've got the 19th.
- I've got the 19th.
- The 19th it is then.
- Huzzah!
- Hey, boys.
What's up?
- Hey, Dad.
Well, actually, after an unusually protracted game of duelling date books, Niles and I have set upon a mutually acceptable evening for an intime soiree.
We're having a dinner party.
Oh, sounds good.
Any night but the 19th.
Well, what's wrong with the 19th?
My poker game's here that night.
- Can't you reschedule it?
- No.
It's always the third Saturday of the month, and everybody shows.
You know, Jimmy once postponed his daughter's wedding just so that he could be here.
And if you ever saw his daughter, you'd know how risky that was.
Gee, Dad, you know, we wouldn't ask if there were any other date that worked.
Do you really expect me to just give up my game just so that you can have one of your intime soirees?
I knew he knew what that meant.
Dad, please, couldn't you at least make a few calls?
Look, I'll tell you what.
If you can change the day, I'll cover your losses that night.
Well, all right, I'll try.
But, you know, these guys lead pretty busy lives.
I can't always get in touch with them.
Yes, let's hope that dog track has a PA system.
All right, Niles, back to our party.
Now, have you got any thoughts on a caterer?
Well, Cornell Evans.
I mean, he's pricey, but he's the best.
- Oh, let's book him.
- Oh, marvellous!
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't know you were on the line.
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.
Well, we're off to the ball.
Don't wait up for us.
Oh, Daphne, wait, wait, wait.
There's something on the back of your dress.
Oh, my God!
It looks like bleach or something.
The dry cleaner must have done it.
- I saw it.
It's nothing.
- You saw it?
- Don't worry.
It's hardly noticeable.
- Dr. Crane noticed it.
- Because he's always looking at your - Roz.
- Well, I can't go now.
- Why not?
This is the only formal dress I've got.
Wait.
I've got the rest of my dry cleaning in the car.
I bet I have something you can wear.
I'll be right back.
You know, Daphne, I bet I would be able to get that out for you.
No, the cleaner spoiled it.
He can damn well fix it.
- Well, it would probably just take - Niles.
Yes, may I speak to Cornell, please?
Yes, of course, I'll hold.
I mean it.
If I just had a toothbrush and a jeweller's loupe Niles!
How long is he gonna keep me on hold?
Oh, hey, Roz, did you find any kind of thing that?
Can't talk right now.
Hello, Cornell?
Yes, Frasier Crane here.
Listen, I'm hoping that you're not booked on the 19th.
Oh, Lord.
Yes, of course, I understand.
Yeah, same to you.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Damn.
Wouldn't you know it?
The only date he's got free is the 11th.
Damn those concert tickets.
Oh, you know who might be available?
Tyler Wilkins.
- Doesn't he work with Cornell?
- Oh, dear God, no.
Mortal enemies.
They were catering a seafood banquet when Cornell flew into a rage because Tyler had ordered mahi-mahi instead of ahi.
Of course, Tyler blamed it on Cornell's stutter, and they haven't spoken since.
Tyler?
Niles Crane.
Yes, I was wondering if you were available on the 19th.
Wonderful.
Dinner for ten.
That's great.
I'll call you later on, we'll discuss the menu.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
That is wonderful.
All right.
We've got you, me, and the fabulous Ashbys.
That leaves six chairs to fill.
We have to have the Berkins.
That's a no-brainer.
Technically, that's two no-brainers.
Forget the Berkins.
- Who else?
- Well, wait a minute.
You can't just steamroll over me.
I want the Berkins.
- Well, I don't.
- Well, I do.
All right, all right.
We'll each have the right to blackball, let's say, three guests.
That way we'll each get an equal voice.
- That's fair enough.
- All right.
There's three for you.
And three for me.
And just to get the blackball rolling.
Bye-bye, Berkins.
All right.
What about John and Carol Peterson?
- Everyone loves them.
- Not everyone.
Blackball!
- Why?
- No, no, no.
We never question the blackball.
We just bow to its will.
Fine.
Nina and Arch Duncan.
The drunken Duncans?
Have you lost your?
Wait a minute.
You loathe the Duncans.
You want me to waste a blackball.
- That's insane.
I adore the Duncans.
- Really?
Well, then perhaps I've misjudged them.
Very well, Niles.
The Duncans it is.
- Nina and Arch - Oh, stop it.
They're hideous.
Blackball.
- What about the Wolperts?
- Oh, I like the Wolperts.
Finally.
Oh, the Gordons?
I love the Gordons.
Now we're rolling.
- How about the DeFalcos?
- Blackball.
She is a twit.
- How about the Whitneys?
- Oh, blackball.
He's a dolt.
- Cromwells?
- Blackball.
Look, if you're going to Wait a minute.
You're out of blackball This is a dried-up old fig.
So is Missy Cromwell.
I don't want her at my party.
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.
The Cromwells are in.
The guest list is complete.
Now, let's start calling everyone.
Yes, beginning with our guests of honour, the Ashbys.
- Oh, yes.
- All right, here.
Hello, Hollis.
Frasier Crane calling.
Listen, Niles and I are planning on having a dinner party on the 19th They're leaving for Africa on the 19th.
Oh, gee, that's a shame.
We were sort of building the evening around you.
They've got the 11th free.
- No good.
We've got that concert.
- I didn't ask you to that.
The 11th should be just fine.
Oh, no, no, they've got a conflict.
Oh, well, that's no problem.
They were our very next call.
We absolutely adore the Duncans.
All right, see you then.
Not the drunken Duncans.
Sorry, they have plans with the Ashbys on the 11th so they're invited too.
Fine.
I want my blackball back.
- The blackball, once dropped, can't - Oh, shut up.
Anyway, the Ashbys are worth it.
You know what?
And there's an additional plus.
Since we're changing our plans for the 11th, Cornell can cater.
Quick.
You call Cornell.
I'll call Tyler and tell him we're cancelling.
Tyler?
It's Niles Crane again.
Yes, listen, it turns out we're not gonna need you on the 19th after all.
- Yes, Cornell, please.
- No, we're not going to someone else.
Cornell?
What gave you that idea?
Cornell, please.
Frasier Crane again.
Thank you.
Listen, we've changed our party plans, and it turns out that we'd rather have it on the 11th.
We're cancelling the party entirely.
No, no, there's no reason to be upset Which is which?
This one's mine.
This one's mine.
I can smell my cologne.
- Hello, Cornell.
- Tyler, of course, you're who we want.
Yes, as I was saying, we were just about to change the - Hello, Tyler - Cornell.
- You're gonna laugh when you hear - It's the funniest thing - Hello?
- Hello?
Well, thanks to your keen sense of smell, we've lost both caterers.
I suppose we can always get Kiki Price.
- Is she still in business?
- Yeah, they dropped the charges.
I'll call her after I get in touch with the Duncans.
My God, I hope I can catch them before happy hour.
Hello, Nina?
Too late.
It's Frasier Crane calling.
Niles and I are having the Ashbys over and a few other people for a dinner, and we were hoping that you could join us on the 11th.
Don't cry, Nina, please.
Yeah, well, I've always loved you too.
What?
Joaquim?
Joaquim is coming in from Argentina.
- You'd like him to join us.
Well - Joaquim?
Joaquim Juarez.
He's the conductor of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic.
Right, they were down there.
They must have met him.
We would love to have Joaquim join us.
Oh, that's splendid.
All right, then we'll just see you on the 11th.
The 11th.
Take two swizzle sticks, stand them up side-by-side.
Eleven.
That's right.
Bye-bye.
- We've got Joaquim!
- Well, don't cry for me, Arch and Nina.
All right, let's see.
We've got the Duncans and Joaquim.
And that means we're going to have to cut out two couples.
All right, well, the Cromwells and - The Gordons.
- The Gordons.
All right, that leaves us short by one.
We're going to need a single female.
Oh, Roz, perfect timing.
- What's up?
- We're having a dinner party.
We need an interesting single woman.
Do you know anybody?
We're desperate.
Excuse me?
Naturally, we thought of you first, Roz, but this isn't really your kind of crowd.
What, sophisticated?
Cultured?
Is that why you think I won't fit in with your snooty A-list friends?
- I'm not genteel enough?
- Oh, now, Roz Now, Roz, my ass.
I'm just as refined as you are.
Shut up, Niles.
Roz, please.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
I got everyone to change.
We're gonna have it on the 11th.
- The 11th?
- Yeah, and it wasn't easy either.
Mel had to reschedule his polyp surgery.
Well, Dad, you are really gonna laugh at this.
Frasier and I rescheduled our dinner party for the 11th.
I'm not changing it back.
I'm not.
And, Dad, I would never even consider asking you to do such a thing.
Tell you what, there's no reason why we can't hold both parties simultaneously.
The apartment is certainly big enough.
I know what you're trying to do, and it won't work.
What, Dad?
I'm serious.
No, no, we can share the buffet table.
We can even have the harpist learn Bobby Darin tunes for your crowd.
I can stand it if you can.
Of course, we will have to dim the lights at one point.
You see, Nina Duncan always insists on sharing her extensive collection of slides from the summer she danced "Agamemnon" at Jacob's Pillow.
All right!
I'll change it.
Call Kiki and the Wolperts.
- I'll talk to Roz.
- I'm on it.
Come on, just pick something.
Pick what?
This one isn't dressy enough.
This one doesn't fit, and this one Well, it's hardly appropriate for a posh cocktail reception.
Excuse me.
Roz, listen, I just came to apologise.
- Whatever.
- What happened?
He said I wasn't classy enough to come to his dinner party.
- Roz, you know I didn't mean that.
- Oh, get in line.
I've lived here for six years.
Only time I'm asked to that table is when I'm holding a freaking serving spoon.
It's just a silly dinner party.
What's everybody getting upset about?
Oh, let's just go.
I suppose this colour might look nice on me after all.
Excuse me.
I left messages for Kiki and the Wolperts.
Could you two please leave so Daphne can change?
Daphne, you're not going out in that, are you?
That's it.
I'm staying home.
No, just try it.
We can accessorise it.
With what?
A lamppost and a public defender?
Good Lord, was that the answering machine?
Hi, it's Allison Wolpert and yes, count us in for the 11th.
Looking forward to it.
Bye.
That's wonderful.
I so enjoy the Wolperts.
- Yes.
- Who was that?
We just got invited to a dinner party at Dr. Crane's.
- Which Dr. Crane?
- Does it matter?
You get the one, you get that other one.
Personally, I think the whole arrangement is a little - Is that thing off the hook?
- What?
Oh, my God.
What do you suppose she meant by that?
Obviously, she thinks we're always together, that we're some sort of couple.
That's ridiculous.
We spend lots of time apart.
Besides, who is she to talk?
Look at her and Harry.
- They go everywhere together.
- They're married, Niles.
Still, it's no reason for her to call us odd.
Well, wait.
She never called us odd.
Listen.
Does it matter?
You get the one, you get that other one.
Personally, I think the whole arrangement is a little - Is that thing off the hook?
- See?
She never said odd.
We're getting upset over nothing.
Nothing?
Is there a good end to that sentence?
"Personally, I think the whole arrangement is a little" what?
Charming?
Now, you really Stop overreacting.
Well, perhaps she has a point.
Ever since your divorce, you've become more and more attached to me.
Maybe that's why she said what she said.
- What?
- You get Frasier, you get that Niles.
She didn't say that.
She said, "You get the one, you get that other one".
What makes you think you're the one and I'm the other one?
Because I am the one giving the party, and you are that other one!
I'm the one that invited her, so that makes you that other one.
- That's ridiculous!
- It's not!
- Absolutely no foundation of truth!
- No, I knew!
All right, wait, wait.
This is absurd.
Why don't we just call Allison up, ask her what she thinks is so strange about us?
We can both get on an extension.
Better yet, we both get on a bicycle built for two, ride over there ourselves, and ask her what's so strange about us?
Hello?
Yes, hello, Nina.
Right.
What can I do for you?
No, no, dear, you called me.
Oh, yes, Joaquim can only eat certain foods.
Yes, of course, we'll be glad to accommodate him.
How exotic.
Let's see.
All right.
Rice.
Beans.
Jerked beef.
Any particular reason?
I see.
Interesting.
Okay.
Bye.
Why is Joaquim on such a strict diet?
Because the Joaquim they're bringing to dinner is their foster child from a tiny village on the Pampas.
He speaks no English, and he gets nauseated when he eats American food.
So he's not the conductor of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic?
Oh, you are so that other one!
All right, fine.
Where are we gonna find someone to babysit a 9-year-old child?
Quit your blubbering and just pick something, damn it!
Roz?
- Now what?
- You were right.
You know, you would be a welcome addition to any party.
Oh, you don't have to say that.
No, no, no, honestly, Niles and I want you to join us for dinner.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
We're having someone who might make a dinner companion for you.
He's not some stuffy old coot, is he?
- No, no.
Young.
- No.
Yes, very young.
Okay, thanks.
- All right, we've got our ten.
- All right, let's see.
Not exactly my wish list, but at least we've got the Ashbys.
Yes, and Allison Wolpert can say what she wants.
Why should we care what anybody else thinks?
- Am I right?
- Absolutely.
Dad, do you think we're odd?
No, you're not odd.
You're just special.
Your mother told me that when you were kids, and I still believe it.
Yes, but do you think we spend too much time together?
What kind of questions are these?
You're close.
Lots of brothers are close.
Yes, I suppose you're right about that.
Yes, I mean, the Gershwins, the Wright Brothers.
I told you we're getting upset over nothing.
Then there were the Collyer brothers.
- The Collyer brothers?
- Oh, yeah, a couple of nutsos, shared an apartment in New York their whole lives.
They even built a maze out of newspapers in there that only they knew how to get through.
Then it collapsed on one of them, and the other one just sat there with the dead body until the neighbours complained about the smell.
Pretty crazy story, huh?
You recycle, right, Niles?
You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea if we went our own ways a bit more.
Well, it's possible we have grown a tad dependent on one another.
Perhaps this is just the warning we need.
Today, we're planning a dinner party.
Tomorrow, we're wearing matching pyjamas and washing each other's hair.
Let's face it, Niles, we are one stone's throw away from becoming the neighbourhood kooks, right down to the local children ringing our doorbell and running away.
Now, Frasier, you are letting your imagination get the better of you.
Come on, let's go make a seating chart.
You always know how to cheer me up.
- Oh, hello, Daphne.
- Daphne Isn't that Roz's dress?
Yes, it was really the only thing that looked good on me.
Come on, Roz, we don't want to be late.
Doesn't she look beautiful?
Oh, shove it, Daphne.
I know you think I look like a hooker.
No!
No, Roz, I said it made me look like a hooker.
On you, it Well, it works.
Hello?
Yes, yes.
Oh, Lord, well, I'm so sorry you can't make it.
No, no, that's all right.
Yes, some other time.
Goodbye.
Oh, please, not the Ashbys.
Family emergency.
Apparently, so urgent they didn't even have time to think up a plausible excuse.
- So where does that leave us?
- Well, let's see.
We have a third-rate caterer with a record, two lushes, a couple who think we're both nutcases, an Argentine wild child and Roz.
Dinner is served.
I still have one blackball left.
I don't think it'll make any difference.
It will to me.
I'm using it on myself.
- No.
- Blackball!
No, no, you cannot self-blackball.
You're gonna go to that party or you'll go over my dead body.
You just give me that now!
God, we are the Collyer brothers.
You know, why don't we just face the inevitable?
Let's just cancel the whole damn thing.
Of course, cancelling a party people will think it's strange.
Frankly, I'm sick and tired of giving a damn about what other people think.
Most of them are one marble away from not being here in the first place.
You're right.
So we spend a lot of time together.
So what?
I enjoy it.
So do I, Niles.
You know, we can make those calls tomorrow and cancel.
I'm famished.
Why don't we just head over to Campagne for dinner?
My treat.
You're on.
Unless you think it's too odd to have dinner together.
I don't think we're in any danger of that.
If our relationship became truly odd, I think we're both intelligent enough to recognise the signs.
- I think I'll pass on dinner.
- Okay, good night.
- I'll see you soon.
- Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, boys, how was dinner?
Let's say when I picked my lobster out of the tank, I had no idea he was in for a better evening than I was.
- What happened?
- Well, it started out well enough.
First, they seated us at a superb table, certainly better than the one next to us, at which, unfortunately, they sat - Daphne and Donny.
- Oh, jeez.
Being very affectionate, of course, whispering, laughing, holding hands.
This in a place where people were trying to eat.
Well, in an attempt to make things better, I suggested that Niles and I switch seats so that he could face the other table.
Unfortunately, moments later, they seated Maris there with her new boyfriend.
Also being affectionate.
Grooming each other like spider monkeys.
She was deliberately taunting me, playing the same coquettish games we used to play in restaurants: Batting her eyes, then coyly hiding behind her breadstick.
And then to top it all off, the Pouilly Fuissé we ordered was a grave disappointment.
I urged he send it back, but he wouldn't create a scene in front of Daphne.
Not that she would've even noticed, the way Donny was feeding her forkfuls of risotto as if she'd lost her arms instead of her mind.
What is she doing with him?
Well, some days, it doesn't pay to get out of bed.
The highlight of my day is getting out of bed so I can slam it back up into the wall.
How long are you gonna stay there?
You can afford the Montana now, can't you?
Yes, but thanks to Frasier, there's a tenant living there.
May I remind you that you begged me to find you a sublet.
Someone austere and dignified enough not to offend your starchy neighbours.
Frasier, I'm not trying to blame you.
It's just my whole world is crashing down around me.
- I wanna go home.
- Well, I'm sorry, Niles.
He's got two months left on his sublet.
Can't you give him a call and lean on him a bit?
Dad, the man has a lease.
I can't very well call and ask him to move out.
- Hi, Daph.
- Evening, all.
- How's dinner?
- It was wonderful.
You should've come over and joined us.
Well, you looked like you had enough to contend with, what with your table's fork shortage.
Donny takes such good care of me.
After you left, I made the tiniest comment about not liking the Pouilly Fuissé, and he sent it back.
That snooty wine steward argued with him, but Donny made a scene with the owner, and the next thing you knew, our entire meal was on the house.
I've never been prouder of him.
Frasier, I wanna go home.
I'll call Dr. MacLowery.
- Why, Dr. Crane, you're back.
- Yes, Mrs. Latimer.
Fortunately, my sublet was able to move out early.
I trust your tour was a success?
- A triumph.
- Good.
Take care.
Tour?
I could hardly let these people know where I was living.
I told them I was on a lecture tour of Africa so they wouldn't try to contact me.
Niles, maybe he isn't here.
Maybe we should just let ourselves in.
Right.
All right.
I'm home.
I can already feel the last four months dropping away.
Yes.
Soon, Africa will be just a memory.
I just wanna close my eyes and savour the serenity.
What the hell is that?
It's Dr. MacLowery.
Doctor Dr. MacLowery, what are you doing?
That was a ball change leading to a riff drop.
You gotta lick it and stick it.
- When did you take up tap dancing?
- Years ago.
I figured if I didn't dance, I'd go crazy.
I'm not sure he caught it in time.
Baseboard.
Baseboard.
Dr. MacLowery, please, the neighbours.
You tell me about it.
Why, those bunch of sourpusses.
Why, all they do is complain.
Sunshine, rain.
Well, look who it is.
It's the Tenants' Board come to welcome me home.
Carol and Alfred Larkin, you remember my brother, Frasier.
Oh, and Mr. Probst.
See here, Crane.
We abhor noise in this building.
I couldn't agree more.
And what do you call that?
I believe that was lick it and stick it.
This has been going on for months.
We would have contacted you if we'd known how to.
I'm sorry, but Dr. MacLowery's moving Dr. Crane, I'm afraid the board is leaning towards rescinding your lease.
What?
Why?
Because you're a menace, Crane.
You always have been.
You have something of a reputation in this building.
What with all the raucous parties you've hosted.
I'm not a well man.
I have a serious heart problem and I demand quiet.
- We all do.
- Mr. Probst, I assure you No, we're having a board meeting tomorrow evening in which we intend to discuss your situation.
And if I were you, I wouldn't plan on unpacking.
So nice seeing you again.
It was good of you to go to all this trouble for your brother.
Yes.
Well, in a way, I felt responsible.
Oh, really?
I don't know why.
Just because you sublet my apartment to Bojangles the Loon.
I'll get it.
Niles, will you relax, please?
- Give me that.
- Oh, relax.
How can I?
In an hour, these people could vote me out of my home.
They won't if you show them a good time at this reception.
A couple of drinks, some food, some witty conversation, they'll realise what an asset you are.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Roz.
Great party, Niles.
I was surprised to get your last-minute invitation.
You're not trying to set me up with anybody, are you?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Good.
You're here because the caterer cancelled.
Now, listen.
We need you to open the wine, cut up some limes and hang up this coat.
You actually think I am so hard up for a night out that I would spend the evening pushing drinks in God's waiting room?
- Keep your voice down.
- Roz, please.
- You're paying for the babysitter.
- All right, done.
- What am I, the dishwasher?
- No, Dad.
You were invited because, well, it just wouldn't be a party without you.
Although there may be a few women here that are unattached, who might just take a shine to an old debonair dog like yourself.
I'm just a piece of meat to you guys, aren't I?
There goes that damn loose earring again.
Thank goodness it didn't fall into the punch bowl.
Don't want someone choking on it, do we?
Yes, although nothing says party like a tracheotomy.
You must tell us all about your African tour, Dr. Crane.
Yes.
Do the local people actually enjoy your lectures?
Well, yes, quite a bit.
Except, of course, for the pygmies.
Most of it went right over their heads.
I'll get it.
The rest of the board.
Pleased to see you.
Come in.
- Hello, good to see you.
- Yes.
Dr. Crane?
While you were on the subcontinent, did you happen to spot any rare African waterfowl?
Just one, but it was already spotted.
I'll get it.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
For God's sake, Niles, will you do something with this damn bird?
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Here.
There you go.
Over here.
Niles sucks.
The boys at the Shangri-La loved teaching her things like that.
- It's so tiring.
- Bite me, Niles.
Right back at you.
Hurry with the hors d'oeuvres.
The guests are hostile toward me.
I'm not gonna win any points by starving them.
- Stuff it, Niles.
- Oh, don't tempt me.
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.
Who is that distinguished-Iooking man over there?
I've been trying to catch his eye, but he's far too engrossed in that gardening book.
Well, that is actually my father, Martin.
Dad?
- Don't mind him.
He's painfully shy.
- I know just how he feels.
I'm a bit of a shrinking violet myself.
Martin.
Do you see that obnoxious old lecher?
Well, you're gonna have to be a lot more specific.
The one in the blue jacket.
I'm about this close to slapping him.
Wait, wait, that is Mr. Hawkins.
He's the vice president of the Tenants' Board.
Well, I don't care who he is.
He just pinched me.
Roz, please, the man is 80 and arthritic.
How hard can he pinch?
People are not talking, not mixing.
- People are pinching.
- Stop it.
Stop it.
The party is just starting.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Don't you touch me.
Daphne, how are those other?
Baby?
Oh, dear God.
This bird's dead.
How did this happen?
She must have eaten some of the hors d'oeuvres.
You mean the ones I just served to Niles' guests?
You are very welcome.
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I completely overreacted.
People perked up once they saw those appetisers of yours.
You know, I think the Niles Crane party curse has finally been laid to rest.
What?
Will somebody please tell me what happened?
I'm gonna let Daphne tell you.
What is it?
I don't mean to alarm you, but there's something wrong with the hors d'oeuvre.
- What?
How do you know?
- A little bird told me.
Sorry, sorry.
I forgot the garnish.
I'm dreadfully embarrassed about this.
Give me that.
Thank you very much.
This is the chef's prerogative.
You understand, of course.
Roz, for God's sake.
Did you see how it happened?
Anything?
Well, I did hear her last words, but I don't think they'd be of much comfort to you.
Oh, God, Niles, I'm so sorry.
The mayonnaise must have gone bad.
Or the crab or the pâté.
Which one did she eat?
I don't know.
Daphne, smell her beak.
All right, all right, Niles, are you all right?
Yeah, I just need a moment.
- Dr. Crane?
- That's long enough.
Excuse me, I'm afraid I spilled punch on my dress.
- I need a towel.
- No.
No.
You're much better off using that Yeah, this bread.
- It's more absorbent.
- Really?
Yes, that's why they call it nature's sponge.
All right.
It's working.
- All right, what do we do now?
- Daphne, you get rid of Baby.
I'll get rid of this tainted food.
But we still have a roomful of hungry guests with nothing to serve them.
Oh, God, would you look at that?
She swallowed my earring.
That's what killed her.
That means we don't have to destroy the hors d'oeuvres.
Frasier, Frasier, stop.
Are there any left?
Yes, we're in luck.
This intrepid little crab puff has survived.
Now, all I need is a very sharp knife and 16 toothpicks.
Niles, I am really getting tired of these people.
Some lady just handed me a piece of wet bread.
- Oh, this party is doomed.
- No, no, Niles, listen.
Don't panic.
We've got everything we need to make hors d'oeuvres.
All we need is time.
You get out there and stall.
All right.
Mrs. Latimer, may I get you some punch?
Well, your father went to get me some, but that was quite a while ago.
Please, allow me.
Here.
By the way, where is that adorable bird of yours?
She's resting.
Travel really takes it out of her.
You didn't take her to Africa, surely.
Well, she has family there.
Mr. Probst, having a good time?
Look here, Crane, if you're not gonna feed us, we might as well take the vote right now.
- No, please.
- I mean, you bring the hors d'oeuvres, you take the hors d'oeuvres away.
What kind of a game is this?
Well, I'm not, I'm not Oh, what a good idea.
Why don't we all play a game?
Anyone have any suggestions?
How about Murder?
We played it at Irene Warriner's party.
It was a hoot.
- Oh, how do we play?
- Well, here.
Someone tear off a few slips of paper and on one of them, write the word "murderer".
Then we'll pass them out and then everyone hide and we'll turn out the lights.
The murderer kills someone, they lay down on the floor, and then we turn on the lights and the detective tries to solve the crime.
I'll tell you what.
I'll volunteer to play the detective for the first round.
Let the mayhem begin.
Oh, Martin, there you are.
Come, hide with me.
I know a little nook where no one will find us.
Oh, this game's a lot scarier than I thought.
All right, turn out the lights.
Everyone, hide.
- I can't see.
- Can I help you, sir?
I don't have my glasses.
Can you tell me what it says on this thing?
- It says "murderer".
- Good.
Then you're dead.
This party just gets better and better.
- How soon?
- I'm going as fast as I can.
First batch should be ready in five minutes.
All right, five minutes it is.
Ready or not, here I come.
My goodness, the foul fiend has struck already.
Turn the lights on.
Good heavens, he's struck twice.
That's not really in the rules, is it?
- Frasier?
- Once dead, you can not speak.
Take your cue from Mr. Probst.
All right, everyone.
Did any of you see anything suspicious?
Any odd behaviour?
Why don't you just guess who did it so we can get this thing over with.
Not yet.
This is very intriguing.
I think I'm going to have to think about it for five minutes or so.
- Maybe this game was a bad idea.
- No, the fun's just starting.
I tell you what.
Let's turn out the lights again and we'll let our craven villain ply his dark trade once more.
Are you quite sure those two didn't die of starvation?
That's very funny.
Will you just turn out the lights?
All right, everyone, hide.
- I have a question.
- No.
No talking.
Just tell me, can the murderer commit suicide?
Well, no, Roz.
That wouldn't make much sense, would it?
That's what I thought, but Mr. Probst is the one who murdered me.
- Oh, was he?
- Yes.
Well, then, Mr. Probst, I don't think someone is playing by the rules, is he?
You see, this way, no one else can get murdered, can they?
Mr. Probst?
What is it?
What are you doing?
- Nothing, Roz, nothing.
- Are you taking his pulse?
I'm trying to.
I just can't find one.
Oh, my God.
When he fell down, I thought it was part of the game.
It didn't even look real.
It's time to wind the game up.
The appetisers are ready and they are delicious.
I think this party is finally back on track.
Niles, I'm afraid Mr. Probst has passed on.
- What?
- Yes, you see, I think that heart condition of his finally caught up with him.
Dead?
No, no, no, he's sleeping.
Old people love to nap.
Mr. Probst, time to wake up.
Mr. Probst Niles, Niles, he's gone.
Oh, my God, this is awful.
How could this happen?
Shouldn't we notify someone?
No, he was a widower.
He had no children.
He lived alone in this building for 25 years.
Oh, this is so awful.
Mr. Probst was right.
I am a menace.
- No, Niles, this is not your fault.
- But it happened at my party.
That's all they'll remember.
I may as well pack my bags.
There's no need for that.
We can still get him out of here without anybody noticing.
How?
- You go find Dad.
- Why?
Tell him to call his friend at the police department.
One of his good friends, all right?
I'll handle the rest.
- All right.
- What's the rest?
I'm going to use the game to distract everyone.
I will take everyone into the kitchen for questioning, thus drawing their attention from the bodies.
- What do you mean bodies?
- Roz - No.
- You've got to get down.
- No way in hell.
- All right, all right, how's this?
I will pay your airfare for that vacation of yours next month.
No way.
It's just too creepy.
- First class?
- Business.
- Done.
- All right, get down.
Lie down.
Frasier, Frasier, I found Dad hiding from Mrs. Latimer.
- He called his friend.
- Great.
I'll start getting everyone in the kitchen.
Won't they wonder why there hasn't been another murder?
- Good point.
- Couldn't we move this along?
- Roz, quiet.
- Here.
The waggon's on its way.
When it gets here, let me deal with it.
- Thank you.
I really appreciate this.
- Dad, we need one more favour.
You are now the killer.
Come on.
You've got to murder somebody, preferably in the kitchen.
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.
You're not gonna make somebody lie down on this dirty floor again, are you?
There you are, Martin.
Have you been hiding from me?
Hiding?
No, you're just the person I've been looking for.
All right, turn on the lights.
Everyone Roz, you okay?
Yeah, it's a carnival down here.
Everyone.
There has been another murder in the kitchen.
I am ready to solve the crime if you will all join me in the kitchen.
Why can't you solve it right here?
Well, I could.
But that wouldn't be proper.
You see, the hors d'oeuvres are in there.
Come along, all right, everyone.
We've got food.
Don't touch the crime scene, please.
Thank you very much.
On your way.
Thank you very much.
Hurry, his fingers are getting stiff.
All right, then.
Before I determine the identity of the killer, there are a few questions I'd like to ask each of you.
- I'll get it.
- No.
No one leaves until I've solved the crime.
Except you, Dad.
All right, then.
I think I shall begin by drawing a diagram of where each of you was standing when the first murder occurred.
We have established that Miss Finn was talking with Mr. Larkin in the upstairs hall at 8:14.
And he muttered something.
Why do you keep looking out there?
I'll ask the questions around here, Mrs. Larkin.
We already told you, your father killed Mrs. Latimer.
- Mrs. Hawkins saw him.
- Mrs. Hawkins thought she saw him.
No, Martin did kill me.
And he's got a lot to learn about playing gently.
Mrs. Latimer, we have already broken the no-eating-while-dead rule, but we will stand fast on the quiet one.
I'm bored, and I'm going home.
No, no, no, wait, you can't blame Niles for this because my father is the killer.
Yes, the case is closed.
Shall we all play another round?
God forbid.
Where's Probst?
He just left.
He wasn't feeling well.
- Yes, I hope he's all right, poor man.
- Who cares?
I never liked the old coot anyway.
You didn't?
I was planning to vote for you tonight just to annoy him.
- Me too.
- Well, why don't we vote right now?
Consider it done.
You're in, Crane.
Welcome back.
Carol, let's get out of here.
Doesn't he have anything stiffer than punch to drink?
I don't like looking at dead bodies, much less touching them.
He's got a bottle of vodka in the freezer.
Oh, great.
Thank you so much for this second chance, and I can assure you, from now on, this will be the quietest apartment in the Montana.
Oh, my God!
Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Evening, Niles.
- Frasier.
Everybody ready?
Just about.
Oh, new cufflinks.
Those are very smart.
Yes, well, you've seen these before, haven't you?
- I always wear them with a tux.
- Of course.
Well, still, nothing catches the eye like a sharp pair of cufflinks.
So those are very nice too.
- Oh, these.
- Gold.
I knew you'd wear silver.
I didn't want us to look alike.
No.
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Roz.
- Hi.
- Come on in.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Well, that's all right.
- Hey, Roz.
- Daphne.
Thank you so much for watching Alice.
She's way overdue for her nap.
Maybe I can get her to sleep.
Great.
We'll set her up in my room.
Don't wanna be late for that auction.
You know, I can't believe that you donated another day behind the scenes of the Frasier Crane Show this year.
Well, why not, Roz?
It's for a good cause.
The Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation does excellent work.
You weren't trapped in my booth with that mouth-breather for three hours last year.
Well, he wasn't that bad.
Some sort of an engineer, wasn't he?
Well, he wasn't a dental hygienist, that's for sure.
Daphne, can you help me with these cufflinks?
Oh, all right.
- What is this, Daphne?
- I'm chatting online with Donny.
Oh, what's he saying?
"I can't wait to come home and see my wittle Engwish cwumpet".
Apparently, he has some sort of typing impediment.
I don't want him to think I've abandoned him.
Would you mind taking over?
Tell him I miss him too.
All right.
And I'm counting the days till he comes home.
And there's no one I love more than my fuzzy-wuzzy Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost him.
- Oh, maybe I can get him back.
- Thank you.
Well, there we are.
Alice is all squared away.
She went right to sleep.
Shall we?
Have a good time.
Don't spend too much.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I've got a whole system worked out where I can get anything I want for the minimum bid.
That's hardly in keeping the spirit of the evening.
We're raising money for the Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation.
Baloney, you just wanna go there so you can hobnob with all your friends.
- That is not true.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, then answer me one question, just who is Kelly Ann Grunther?
Kelly Ann Grunther is the person responsible for the Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation.
Yes, but what does that mean?
She's a very wealthy person that put up a lot of money, right?
I thought she had some kind of disease.
I thought she was a scientist doing research.
In other words, it could've been called the Eddie Eddieman Foundation as long as there was fancy food on silver platters.
Do you see anything exciting to bid on?
Well, no, it's mostly the same items as last year.
"A day of beauty with internationally known stylist Raphael".
Yes, I see Missy Cromwell put down for that.
Well, can you blame her?
Her last day of beauty was during the Johnson administration.
Actually, Niles, this is rather interesting.
"The Laureate Luncheon.
Break bread with three Nobel Prize winners, Doctors Alan Zafrin, Jane Randall, and Terence Quinn".
Oh, my.
It's an opportunity to meet with three of the greatest thinkers of our time.
I'm amazed they even got them all in the same room together.
Zafrin is a legendary recluse.
Yes, he'll be at Fiddlestix tomorrow at noon.
- I'll try that.
- Good luck to you, Niles.
- Thank you.
- They say Quinn is quite witty.
In nuclear physics circles, he's referred to as the half-life of the party.
Well, what do we have at this table?
Oh, the Windsor Monarch 2000, huh?
Isn't this the one they had to recall because the propane tanks kept exploding?
- They did?
- Yeah.
I sure feel sorry for this guy, Martin Crane.
Better get himself an apron that says "kiss the chef good-bye".
Are you bidding on this one too?
No, no, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier Crane's producer.
If you win this, you'll be spending the afternoon with me.
Well, I hope I do.
I'm a big fan of the show.
Hello there.
Hi, Noel.
What are you doing here?
I came to bid on my favourite auction item.
I should warn you, lady luck is on my side tonight.
The last guy who rented this tux left a perfectly good comb in the pocket.
- May I?
- Oh, gosh.
Oh, there's no pen.
I'm sorry, Noel.
No problemo.
I wear one around my neck.
- Oh, damn.
- What is it?
It looks like I have some competition for this luncheon.
An Alistair Mowbray doubled my bid to $500.
I've heard that name before.
Yes, you know, it sounds familiar to me too.
Wait a minute, isn't he that young, ruthless software tycoon?
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.
There's no use competing against those deep pockets.
But this vase here deserves a second look.
Yes, but wait a minute.
Mowbray?
Wasn't that the nom de plume you used in prep school for your society column?
What a remarkable coincidence.
You were secretly trying to outbid me.
All right.
I thought if you were bidding against a stranger, you'd go so high, but if it was me, then your childish competitiveness would kick in.
Well, that is nonsense.
Give me the pen.
No, no, I'm saving you from yourself.
- Give me that.
- I will not.
In the name of Kelly Ann Grunther and everything she stands for - She can't stand.
- How do you know?
I asked.
I can't believe I'm bidding this much.
Don't worry.
We're gonna have so much fun.
It'll be so great being in that booth together, Roz.
No need to get me extra headphones.
I'll just share yours.
We are coming up on the final minute of tonight's auction.
No bids will be accepted after the whistle blow.
Listen, Jody, can I talk to you?
I'd love to bid more, but I'm really at my limit.
I really want you to win this.
I really think we would hit it off.
Oh, you too, huh?
I thought I sensed a little spark between us, Roz.
A spark?
Maybe after the show we could get a drink or have some dinner?
You like Italian?
Well, I think it's time to separate the men from the boys.
You will never top this bid.
You're right, Niles.
I won't top it.
I will double it.
Then I'd like to see the look on your face when I double your bid.
What?
You didn't double it.
You just added $50 to it.
Yes!
The geniuses are mine.
Well, there certainly was some spirited bidding over this luncheon, wasn't there?
My goodness.
Four thousand, 50 dollars.
What have I done?
You've let your competitiveness get the better of you.
It serves you right.
Due to the overwhelming interest in this luncheon, I propose adding another place to the table.
That is, if we can convince our runner-up, Dr. Frasier Crane, to match his brother's generous bid.
What do you say, Dr. Crane?
All right.
Dear God, we've just spent $8000 for a lunch.
Frasier, just try to remember it's for a very worthy cause.
Thanks to the Doctors Crane, there will be a lot fewer homeless cats on the streets of Seattle next year.
- Hey, Daph.
- Hey.
- Have a good time at the auction?
- Oh, yeah.
I got a great new barbecue, Windsor Monarch 2000.
I wonder if they named it that because that's the one the royal family uses.
Oh, I'm sure it is.
That's actually the new postage stamp in England.
Her Majesty with a pair of barbecue tongs and a sauce brush.
Yes, well, at least Dad didn't have to go into debt for his purchase.
Oh, yes.
Roz told me about your lunch with the geniuses.
- What?
Roz beat us back here?
- Yeah, she was trying to ditch Noel.
Apparently, he's not allowed onto the highway with his moped.
Frasier, do you ever wonder why we do all this competition?
Where did it even start?
Well, that's a good question, Niles.
Well, think back.
What is the first thing you can remember us competing over?
Have to be Mom.
We were always jockeying for her time and attention.
Yes, well, it was a lot more difficult for me, actually.
- You being her favourite.
- What?
You were the favourite.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Niles.
She adored you.
Don't you remember the time that you lost your tricycle?
She actually took mine away from me, gave it to you.
That was for your own good.
No 8-year-old should be riding a tricycle.
I had a chronic ear infection that affected my balance.
Mom worshipped the ground you walked on.
Remember when we brought those bowls home from pottery class, she used yours for cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving and mine as a dog dish.
What did you expect her to do?
You painted a little dog right on it.
That was a turkey.
Well, isn't this ironic?
If both of us thinks the other one was the favourite then neither of us was.
Oh, so all our competition was pointless.
Oh, I wish we'd talked about this years ago.
Oh, Lord, yes.
The angst we could have spared ourselves.
Do you remember those IQ tests that we took?
- I was sick waiting for the results.
- Which we never found out, of course.
Mom refused to tell us anything except that we were two points apart.
- I knew you had the higher score.
- I was convinced you did.
Well, Mom was certainly right not to tell us.
Yes, she certainly was.
She knew back then that we were both too childish and competitive to handle it.
You know what would be a sign of real growth, Niles?
To find out those scores right now?
Exactly.
How often in life are you afforded an opportunity to discover really how much you've evolved?
Exactly.
Dad?
Do you know what our IQs are?
No, but I got a pretty good idea at that auction tonight.
No, Dad, the IQ tests that we took when we were children.
- Would you have saved those?
- Sure.
Your mother and I saved all that stuff, report cards, finger paintings, poems.
It's in an old Ballantine's box in my closet.
Oh, Dad, why don't you just admit it?
You're more of a sentimentalist than you let on.
Yeah, I guess I am.
That was the first case of beer your mother and I ever bought together.
I still can't get over how much they spent at that auction.
Oh, they've always tried to one-up each other.
Yeah, I suppose all brothers are like that.
Mine certainly were.
Everything was a contest.
Who could run the fastest, jump the highest.
They even had this strange one where they'd take little brother Michael, put him in a potato sack and see who could bowl him the farthest over the frozen lake out back.
Oh, they loved that game.
Until that year the spring thaw set in early, and poor Michael went right through the ice.
Oh, they caught hell for that one, they did.
Caught it worse a week later when Michael's toe finally fell off.
Michael cried and cried, till they told him to put it under his pillow for the Toe Fairy.
Then when he got five quid for it, why, it was all they could do to stop him from sawing off the rest of them.
God, what's keeping you guys with that box?
Here it is, Dad.
Gosh, this is a virtual treasure trove of memorabilia.
Can't believe what's in this.
Choir ribbons, Most Improved Badminton.
- Oh, yes.
- The tap dance certificate.
Yeah, I remember going through that box with your mother.
She always knew just what to say to cheer me up.
"So what if the trophy says 'Baking' instead of 'Baseball', Marty.
Catcher's mitts or oven mitts, they're our little champions".
Now, wait, this is report cards.
This might be something.
Well, here they are.
Congratulations, Frasier.
One twenty-nine.
Is that good?
Oh, good?
It's practically genius.
Bravo, Frasier.
Listen up, Niles, now.
Where are you?
Higher or lower?
I don't see mine yet.
I am higher.
Well, congratulations.
I doff my hat to you, Mr. 131.
Higher.
What do you mean, higher?
Mom told us we were two points apart.
Well, apparently, Mom was being tactful.
How tactful?
- Well - Give me that!
One fifty-six.
My God, that's - Twenty-seven points.
- Yes, I know!
I never should have told you guys about the box.
No, no, Dad, I'm fine with this.
The entire point of this exercise was to prove that Niles and I have moved beyond our competitiveness.
And we have.
I'm very proud of my little brother.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I am proud of how mature you are being about all of this.
In fact, if there were a test for maturity, I think your score would be much Niles, that's enough.
You know what?
I suggest that we go ahead and call it a night, Niles.
We want to be nice and refreshed for our meeting with the three geniuses tomorrow.
Or in my case, the four geniuses.
Oh, now, you, well Good night, Dad.
Well, I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Oh, good night, Niles.
- Yeah, okay.
- Sleep tight.
- You too.
Daphne, is that university library open all night?
I think so.
Why do you ask?
Do you think I'd let my little brother humiliate me?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Dad, he is smarter than I am.
Niles will be sitting there rambling on with the geniuses about the cosmos, black holes, matter, anti-matter, and I won't matter at all.
I'm going to have to make myself a nice thermos full of coffee and get down to that library.
Frasier, what do you think you're gonna learn in one night?
Just enough to ask some informed questions, Dad.
I may not have a 156 IQ, but I am a quick study.
Daphne, is there something wrong with this coffee pot?
You have to plug it in.
Well, there.
You won't have to tell me that again.
Hello, Niles.
Frasier.
Sleep well last night?
Oh, yes.
Like a baby.
Like a baby with library privileges.
I know what you did.
How?
The way you rushed me out of there last night.
I sensed something was up so I waited in my car, and sure enough, ten minutes later you tore out of your garage.
Oh, Niles, I'm so sorry.
It's just that No, no, no, I don't wanna hear any more of your facile excuses.
- Excuse me.
- Gesundheit.
I'm sorry, I think your competitiveness has sunk to a new low.
Please, I'm ashamed of you.
Please, I'm terribly sorry.
It's just I was so insecure about even coming to this luncheon at all.
Wait a minute.
You just scratched your ear.
You were at the library too.
I most certainly was not.
The only thing that makes you sneeze and scratch your ear is your parchment-mite allergy!
So that was you sneezing from behind the stacks all night.
Oh, I had to go.
I knew you'd be racing through those scientific journals faster than a proton in a particle accelerator.
Oh, stop showing off.
Speaking of accelerating particles, do something about that sneezing.
I took some of these before, but they're not as strong as I thought.
I'm going to take a couple more.
Niles, why don't you just go home and go to bed?
Oh, that is exactly what you'd like for me to be happening.
What did you just say?
Well, you didn't repeat it the first time, I'm not gonna listen to it.
Niles, that medication, it's affecting your speech.
You've just taken a second dose of it.
You're gonna make a fool out of yourself.
Well, you should talk.
Look at your shaking hands and your twitchy eyes.
You were up all night drinking coffee all last night, weren't you?
I am not twitching.
You will not psych me into twitching.
Gentlemen, may I offer you a?
- Sir, is your eye bothering you?
- No, no, it's fine.
Can I get you something to drink?
No, thank you.
Well, yes, some coffee.
Decaf.
I'd like a cup of tea sounds nice.
- Very good.
- You know what, Niles?
You really should leave.
You're embarrassing yourself.
For God's sakes.
I'm never leaving while you're still not leaving.
You know you had the good bed.
Well, now, you're just hallucinating.
No, when we moved to Wallace Lane, and we shared a room and you got to pick where you would be having your sleeping.
Niles, the beds were identical.
Why am I even bothering to explain this to a man who has his elbow in the butter?
Well, who is hallucinationing now?
Niles, have you ever taken these pills before?
No, but they fixed my nose.
No, I just wish they wouldn't make me so hyper.
Yes.
Oh, good Lord!
For God's sakes, you spilled water all over me, you jackass.
- Here, just give me another napkin.
- Oh, napkin.
- Give me, give me, give me that!
- Napkin, napkin, napkin.
- Oh, Niles, wake up, wake up.
- Excuse me.
Oh, Dr. Zafrin.
Goodness, this is quite an honour.
Here, allow me.
Allow me to introduce Dr. Niles Crane.
Well, Niles, I'm surprised to see you up so soon.
You feel all right?
I feel not bad.
A little dry.
When I blink, it makes a scratching noise.
Well, here.
Let me get you a little water here.
- Well, thank you.
- Here we are.
So how long did we last at the lunch?
Well, not too long.
Nine thousand dollars doesn't buy you the leisurely lunch it used to.
Wait a minute.
I thought it was 8000.
No, no, no, you knocked over the aquarium on the way out.
You know, if ever I feel envy about your IQ again, I'll just conjure up the image of you sprawled out on a bed of live koi, weeping and desperately trying to revive that little plastic diver.
Oh, dear God.
Hurry up with those patties.
I got five more pounds in the fridge.
Right, Dad.
Dad's having his poker chums over to test out the new barbecue.
You can give me a hand here.
Is it gonna end, Frasier?
All this obsessive competitiveness.
Oh, probably never, Niles.
You know, whether it started with seeking Mom's approval or some other insecurity, we're locked in a pattern now that we'll probably never get out of.
- That sounds bleak.
- No, no, not necessarily.
- There have been some benefits to it.
- What?
I probably wouldn't have done so well in school if it hadn't been for my fear that I'd be bested by my brainy little brother.
Well, I was certainly spurred on by your success as well.
Why else would I have joined the chess club, the drama club and the key club?
And what other possible reason would there be for me to spend an entire summer training a seeing-eye dog?
Aside from helping the blind.
You know what?
I might not have pushed myself on to Harvard and Oxford.
Well, I might not have been led to psychiatry, which has been the saving grace of my life.
You see, Niles, frankly, we both have a lot to thank each other for.
We've come a long way from those two little boys just starving for a parent's approval.
- How are they coming?
- Oh, just great, Dad.
- We're going as fast as we can.
- Here you are.
- Nice job on those patties.
- Thank you.
- Really?
You think so?
- Yeah.
Not too thick, not too thin, tight enough to hold their shape.
Perfect.
Well, thank you, Dad.
- Yeah, wait till you see the next batch.
- Yeah.
You know, I'm surprised you let him keep that out there.
Oh, well, yeah.
It's a bit of an eyesore and, frankly, kind of a fire hazard, but what the hell, it makes him happy.
Lodged an anonymous complaint with the building?
- It'll be gone by Thursday.
- That's nice.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Frasier, was that the author Dr. Gordon Edelstein?
- Yes.
- I wasn't aware that you knew him.
We just met.
You see, the station is hiring another call-in psychiatrist for a one-week trial period.
They've asked me to choose among the finalists.
Well, he'd be wonderful.
I just finished his book on the victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Poor tic-ridden devils.
Niles, before you take out your utensil chamois, I've got to tell you, I've got another interview in just a few minutes, though it's gonna be hard to top Dr. Edelstein.
- I'd say you're taking this rather well.
- What do you mean?
Many people in your position would feel threatened at the thought of, well, another cat sharing the litter box.
Your flattering analogy aside, Niles, I take it as a tribute.
Obviously, the station is so pleased with my show they're looking for more of the same.
They can hardly ask me to do another three hours.
You can imagine how exhausting that would be.
And for you as well.
Anyway, moving on to me, what's the verdict?
- Verdict?
- On my new look.
- I say you deserve some of the credit.
- Really?
Yes, you keep saying I should accept Daphne's relationship with Donny and find a paramour of my own.
Well, the hunt is on.
I thought to bolster my self-esteem, I would adopt this raffish new look.
Well, it suits you.
Dashing and yet understated and Oh, I give up.
What are we talking about?
My moustache.
I grant you, it's at an early stage.
What stage?
Research and development?
- Dr. Crane.
Dr. Nora Fairchild.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Welcome.
I can't tell you what a privilege this is.
I listened to your show today and I was amazed.
Well I hope that doesn't sound too fawning.
Fawning is just fine.
Fawning is fun.
I hope I'm not interrupting another interview.
No, no, this is my brother, Niles Crane.
He's just about to leave.
I should have known you two were brothers.
The same superb fashion sense, the same refined yet masculine good looks.
You must be so proud of your kid brother, the radio star.
Well, yes.
Congratulations on your new job.
I hope you'll be very happy at KACL.
Isn't that a bit premature?
Oh, well, let's just say I know my little brother.
- Well, here's where it all happens.
- Dr. Nora, welcome.
Please come in.
I see you've already met our crack station manager.
Yes.
I wanna thank you both for making me and my producer feel welcome.
Is everyone around here as friendly as you two?
- Well - Well, hello there.
Some are even friendlier.
This is my producer, Roz Doyle.
Dr. Nora.
And this is my producer, George.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.
Follow me and I'll give you the lay of the land.
Let's just hope that's a figure of speech and not a sales pitch.
Well, Nora, please, please, do come in.
Make yourself at home.
Here we are.
Get settled in.
Here's your headset.
Of course, the phone lines.
Everything's self-explanatory.
Cough button, on-air button.
Listen, I want you to remember, it's all right to be nervous.
Even my first show was a tad bumpy.
Bumpy?
It was a train wreck.
Medic, we got incoming.
Thank you, Kenny.
You weren't even here then.
I got a tape of it from my Secret Santa.
- Break a leg, Dr. Nora.
- Thank you.
I'll get out of your hair.
Godspeed, Dr. Nora.
What are you smirking about?
Oh, gosh, it's just so much fun to have a protégé.
Do you see the way she behaves towards me?
It's like a shy Japanese novice bowing before her Frasier sensei.
I feel a bow coming on myself.
Could you pass me that wastebasket?
Stop it.
All right, she's about to start.
I just wanna catch the beginning, make sure she's got those first-show jitters under control.
Let's get right to our first caller.
Who do we have?
We have Jenny from Tacoma on line one.
Hello, Jenny.
I'm Dr. Nora and I'm here to help.
Hi, Dr. Nora.
My boyfriend and I have been living together for about two years.
Are you having sex?
Our sex life's not the problem.
It's great.
But whenever I mention marriage, he changes the subject.
Do you think that he's afraid of commitment?
No, that's not it.
Let me help you see this from a different perspective.
You're a whore, Jenny.
You're sleeping with a man you're not married to.
In my book, that's a whore.
Well, I'm not a whore.
I'm a flight attendant.
Oh, you think there's no overlap?
Well, she's got her jitters under control.
Wake up, Jenny, you've blown it.
Dump this creep.
Find a new guy, and until you're Mrs. New Guy, you keep those knees together, okay?
Staple them.
I don't care if you have to hop to the altar.
God bless, honey.
Who's next?
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hello.
Notice anything?
Oh, yes.
Don't you look dashing.
Blue really is your colour.
Hold still, though, there's something on your lip.
Oh, wait, it's some sort of hair.
Actually, it's a moustache.
Oh, yes, so it is.
Still a bit on the wispy side.
Yeah, it puts me in mind of me Grammy Moon.
Or rather, it will do, once it's grown in a bit.
- Turn on the radio.
- Is something the matter?
Just turn the radio on to KACL, please.
Listen to me.
You have a child.
You think you have the right to get divorced just because you're tired of your husband?
But he's gay.
You picked him.
You made a baby with him.
Maybe you got him drunk, maybe you dressed up as Antonio Banderas, I don't care.
Just make it work.
Well, that's a bit harsh.
Please, this is a woman who believes the Spanish Inquisition was just tough love for heretics.
We were listening to her while I was doing my exercises, - and I don't think she's so bad.
- Excuse me?
Well, it's nice to have someone stand up for old-fashioned values.
Like sex.
I mean, I'm no prude, but in my day, sex was still something sacred and mysterious.
Nowadays, you can't even turn on the television without hearing all this stuff.
Well, I think that explains our 90-dollar cable bill this month.
I liked her too.
She reminds me of my old mum.
She'll point out every little flaw you've got, remind you of every mistake you ever made.
Tell you you're lazy, you'll never amount to anything and no good man will ever have you.
But it's just because she loves you.
In fact, I think I'll give old Mum a call.
You know, if you hate her so much, why did you hire her?
Well, I didn't know she was going to behave this way.
She said all the right things at the interview.
She certainly did.
She complimented his clothes, his looks, she even pretended to think I was the older brother.
Of course, the moustache may have clouded her judgement on that.
She has a moustache?
Well, like it or not, I am responsible for her being here.
I'll just have to have a talk with her, tell her to soften her approach before she alienates her entire audience.
People can tell the difference between constructive criticism and outright abuse.
No, Mum, me boyfriend hasn't dumped me for someone prettier and smarter yet.
She's such an old tease.
Until tomorrow, then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
Dr. Nora.
Such a frosty tone.
Is something the matter?
I have just one question for you.
What kind of vicious, judgemental, name-calling, machete-mouthed bitch are you?
I was going for the less feisty version.
I heard what you said to that single mother yesterday.
For your information, I happen to be a single mom too.
That doesn't surprise me, after watching you pounce on poor George like a Kodiak bear on a salmon.
- That does it!
- Roz, Roz, stop it.
I've got to talk to Dr. Nora before her show.
Just pencil in the hair-pulling for later, all right?
All right, but this isn't over between us.
If you want to, I'll take this out on the street.
That would hardly be fair.
You'd have the home-field advantage.
Roz, Roz, Roz, get out.
Out.
Well, I don't even know where to begin.
Save it.
Whatever it is, I've already heard it.
"Dr. Nora is mean.
Dr. Nora hurts people's feelings".
Too bad.
I'm not here to coddle people.
- I'm here to help them.
- Oh, really?
And just how were you helping that poor confused bisexual woman by calling her an equal-opportunity slut?
The worst thing about this is how you misrepresented yourself to get this job.
You're hardly one to question my ethics.
We both know you hired me because you hoped I might sleep with you.
- That thought never occurred to me.
- Now who's lying?
You won't admit that, like most men, you leave all major decisions to your penis.
Fortunately for Seattle, your penis chose right.
It just didn't know why.
Yes, well, you're just forgetting one thing, Dr. Nora.
You are here on my recommendation.
You may consider it withdrawn.
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Kenny, just the man I wanted to see.
Dr. Nora.
Don't hit me.
I wanna talk about Dr. Nora's show.
Get in line.
The switchboard's been going nuts.
- I don't doubt it.
- They love you.
Excuse me?
Except for the ones that hate you.
Either way, they're listening.
So you consider that option picked up.
- Ten seconds.
- Thank you, Kenny.
Now get out of my booth.
Yes, ma'am.
Kenny.
You can't be serious about hiring that woman full-time.
Putting that woman behind a mike is like putting Typhoid Mary in a kissing booth.
I'm sorry, doc.
Ratings are ratings.
Hello, Dr. Nora.
My name is Tom and I have this co-worker who's really driving me up the wall.
What can I do about it?
Not a thing, Tom.
Not one damn thing.
Nothing I ever do is good enough for her.
I baked a cake for her birthday and she said it tasted like sawdust.
I know she's my mother, but sometimes I just wanna shut her out of my life.
Oh, Denise, burning bridges solves nothing.
I'd like to suggest that you seek family counselling to help you and your mother get to the root of these issues, provided your mother is willing to cooperate.
If not, perhaps individual counselling would help.
Will you stay on the line so Roz can give you some numbers?
Okay.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
It's my pleasure.
Well, I see through the glass that Dr. Nora either disagrees with me or has just eaten a bad clam.
I'm sure she'll tell us which when the Dr. Nora Show begins, right after this traffic report from Chopper Dave.
Okay, Denise, I've got the numbers for you.
- Do you have a pencil?
- Come on, Roz, hurry up.
I wanna get out of here before her trainer shows up with a bucket of live mice for her pre-show feeding.
I'm sorry to cut you off, Chopper Dave, but we have a therapy emergency.
- Denise, are you still on?
- Yes.
- That's my caller.
- Denise.
I want you to ignore everything Dr. Crane just told you.
I know more about mothers than he does.
And here is fact number one: They don't change.
Cut this woman out of your life.
- I don't believe this.
- You don't think that with counsel?
When you have a tumour, what do you do?
Do you sit it down and say, "Hey, tumour, let's get along, okay"?
No, you take a knife and you cut it out.
Well, Denise, your mother is a tumour.
My heart bleeds for you, because I have been there.
I know how hard it is to look at your mother's face and say: "Bye-bye, you toxic harpy.
You're not hurting me again".
But that is what you have to do.
I think maybe you're right.
I'm always right.
And you know what else?
I bet your cake was yummy.
God bless, honey.
- Who's next?
- We have Frasier from here.
How dare you ambush Denise that way?
Well, what a surprise.
I dare to give one of Frasier's callers a second opinion, and what does Frasier say?
Yes, sound effects, the therapist's best friend.
You realize what you're doing is unprofessional.
Denise called my show.
She didn't ask for your opinion.
And I didn't ask for yours.
Back to you, Chopper Dave.
She just cut me off.
All right, let's just settle this.
We don't like each other, but we're gonna have to coexist here.
So why don't we agree that I won't criticize you and you won't criticize me.
Deal?
- No.
- No?
No, I will undermine you every chance I get, because you, Dr. Crane, are a dangerous man.
- I'm dangerous?
- Yes.
Seattle's great enabler.
You tell tramps and fornicators that their problem is low self-esteem.
They should have low self-esteem.
They're going to hell.
I take it back.
You're not unprofessional, you're a freaking loon.
Five seconds.
All right, if it's war you two want, it's war you'll get.
Right, Roz?
You don't actually buy all this no-sex stuff of hers, do you?
- Yeah.
- Well, it's war!
- Oh, hi, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.
As you've probably noticed, I shaved my moustache.
I decided a better way to change my look was to pump some iron.
- So, what, you joined a gym?
- I certainly did.
I start the minute my weight belt gets back from the monogrammer's.
Frasier, you free for dinner?
Well, I suppose so, yes.
Hey, look who I bumped into in the elevator.
- Roz.
- Hey, Roz.
I've been on the phone all day digging up dirt on Dr. Nora, - and you will not believe what I found.
- Really?
I called the station where she worked and they couldn't wait to dish her.
For starters, she has no medical degree.
Her doctorate is in Physical Education.
She's a gym teacher.
Wouldn't wanna be the chubby kid in that gym class.
Or the boy in the monogrammed weight belt.
Well, this is just dynamite, Roz.
Oh, that's not even half of it.
Her name isn't Fairchild.
She was born Mulhern.
And Little Miss Family-Values has two divorces behind her and an affair with a married man.
Tomorrow, I am going to drop this little bombshell to start my show and end hers.
You know, Fras, when I was on the force, I went through a feud like this with Charlie Drucker, and believe me, it's not worth it.
I started out by making a joke about his chest.
- His chest?
- Yeah.
He was, like, a heavyset guy and he had those, you know, man bosoms.
So he heard about it and he got mad at me and he wrote something about me on the men's room wall, and I should have just called it quits right there and then, but his name being Drucker brought out the poet in me.
And it just got worse and worse, and we both ended up looking like idiots.
I don't intend to get into a feud with her, I just wanna get her off the air.
But if you attack her like that, aren't you just descending to her level?
You know, Roz, maybe they're right.
Look at what this woman has reduced me to already: Trading barbs, yelling over the air.
Now I'm spreading rumours about her.
Is that any way for a psychiatrist to deal with conflict?
Don't you wimp out on me.
Now, Roz, just think about it.
There may be a better way.
You know what, Dr. Nora is clearly a damaged and angry woman.
Maybe I could find out what's at the root of that anger and help her, also proving that my method of therapy is the more valid one.
Why are you doing this to me?
Look, if you have a tumour Roz, stop it!
If you wanna analyse her, you might start with that whole mother thing.
I caught her show yesterday.
That seemed to be a hot-button issue.
Yes, it did, didn't it?
They've been estranged for years.
Perhaps we could find the woman and discover what caused this rift between them.
- Maybe even effect a reconciliation.
- Of course, it won't be easy.
We don't even know if the woman's still alive.
Yes, all sorts of things could happen to a woman her age.
Her mother could've had a heart attack or a stroke.
Exactly.
She could be hit by a bus as she's coming out of the pub, or fall asleep smoking a cigarette and be burned to a crisp right there in her smelly bed.
Or she could fall off a ferry and be pulled down under the water, the roar of the waves drowning out her cries for help, until no one could hear that shrill voice of hers, not ever again.
Well, I'm all done with me darks.
Listen to me.
You should be shunning this woman, not rewarding her with gifts.
A baby shower for an unwed mother.
Now I've heard it all.
Who's next?
Roz.
Did her mother get here all right?
Yes, but I'm begging you, we could drive a stake through that thing's heart right now!
Roz, please, trust me.
My way is better.
Get in there.
Mrs. Mulhern, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Dr. Crane, I can't thank you enough for finding me and bringing me here.
Well, I was so moved by your story, it's a joy to do this for you.
For 20 years, I've wondered where my little girl was and if I'd ever see her again.
What did you two fight about to begin with?
Oh, I blame myself.
I thought the man she wanted to marry wasn't good enough for her.
So she eloped, and I've been so afraid the emphysema would finish me before I could ask her forgiveness and tell her I love her.
Well, tell her you shall.
Roz?
Forget couples therapy, Allison.
He is a loser.
If you don't drop him right now, you deserve every bit of misery that you get.
God bless, honey.
Who's next?
We have Frasier Crane on line one.
Frasier, you wanna yell at me for that last call?
No, although I do believe that a gifted therapist can help two people put aside their anger and heal the differences between them.
I have someone here with me today.
Someone you haven't seen for quite a while.
There's something she'd like to tell you.
Something she's wanted to tell you for a very long, long time.
Mrs. Mulhern?
You little whore!
Mother!
So you thought you could get away from me, did you?
Thought you could leave me to rot in that dump without barely enough cash for a bottle of Mateus.
You'll pay for that, missy.
I was wrong, Frasier.
Your way is better.
- Mrs. Mulhern!
- Keep out of this!
- Mother, please, I am doing my show.
- Yes.
You're Little Miss Perfect now, aren't you?
Telling everybody else how wicked they are.
They should hear about your past.
Mrs. Mulhern, please.
The shame you brought on me, you ungrateful tramp.
Please, I'm a good girl now.
How you were paid.
Paid to leave town by that nice boy's family.
For God's sake, Nora, go to commercial.
There, Seattle, now you know what I mean when I say there's people you just don't need in your life.
- Help me out, George.
- What do they pay you here?
I want my cut.
I knew that you hated me, but I just can't believe you could be so cruel.
I was trying to help.
She seemed delightful on the phone.
I want $50 right now.
How many times will I have to move before I'm finally free of her?
Nora, I'm sorry.
- You owe me, missy.
I gave you life.
- Mrs. Mulhern.
How could you?
Frasier, we've got dead air.
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.
I'm sure Dr. Nora's listeners join me in hoping that she and her mother can resolve these differences very soon.
They're off to a bit of a bumpy start but at least the lines of communication are open.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Know what I could go for?
Some fried eggs and bacon.
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.
Oh, hot.
- Don't give him any toast.
- I'm not.
Lifestyle, Sports and recycling.
Yes, we see you, Eddie.
Eight o'clock on the dot.
Well, he's a dog.
What do you expect?
He's a creature of habit.
- Good morning, all.
- Hey, Fras.
- Dad, Daphne.
- Go on.
- Morning.
- Say, Dad, you remember that woman I went out with on Valentine's Day, but I wasn't quite sure if it was a romantic thing?
Yeah, that new publicity woman at the station.
Yes, Cassandra Stone.
Well, I asked her out again last night, and I got my answer.
Oh, I'm sorry, Fras.
No, I'm not finished.
That's the spirit.
You hang in there.
You know, Dr. Crane, someone once said that long periods of abstinence can actually refresh the soul.
- Good morning, everyone.
- That someone was me and I was full of it.
Everyone, this is Cassandra.
You must be Frasier's dad.
I've heard all about you.
- Marty Crane.
- Nice to meet you.
Well, nice to meet you too.
You are so cute.
Now I see where Frasier got those gorgeous eyes.
And this is Daphne Moon, my father's home-healthcare worker.
Hello.
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?
Oh, I could go for an English muffin.
Perhaps our own English muffin could fetch that for you.
- Or I could get it.
- No, no, I'll get it myself.
Way to go, Fras.
I like her.
Gee, I wonder why.
"Now I see where Frasier gets those gorgeous eyes".
Niles.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Frasier, we'll lose our court.
I must warn you, I may be unbeatable today.
Our squash pro, Octavio, taught me a backhand slice that could shave the bristles off a kiwi fruit.
Niles, I'm afraid we may have to reschedule today.
You see, I had a date last night.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah Hey, but there's no sense moping around.
Game of squash is the best thing for you.
I can't think of a better way to lift your spirits.
- Good morning.
- Keep thinking.
I tell you, Roz, the entire evening was pure magic.
Well, I'm happy for you.
You have been in a dry spell, haven't you?
Oh, no, Roz.
Actually, that was just the calm before the storm.
I assure you, we are in the midst of a full-blown love hurricane.
You were so much easier to be around when you were horny and pathetic.
I'm sorry.
I have been monopolising the conversation.
So, what's going on with you?
Well, actually, it has been a really exciting week.
Of course, Alice's first birthday party is this Sunday, and we're having 12 of her little friends over.
She loves bears, so the whole party's gonna be this bear theme: Party favours, bear cake.
I'm gonna dress up like a bear, I think, and do a little bear dance.
That's really great about you and Cassandra.
Yes, yes.
We're really hitting it off, I think.
Frasier?
- Faye.
- Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Hi, it's been a while.
Gosh, oh, Faye Moskowitz, this is my producer, Roz Doyle.
- Hey.
- How are you?
So, what have you been up to?
Well, I just got back from Paris.
Really?
I didn't even know you'd gone.
You didn't get my message?
Oh, Frasier, before I forget, Faye called.
She's going to France for a month.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
It's great to see you.
- We should get together for coffee.
- I'd love to.
I'm on my way out.
Why don't you take my seat?
- Thanks, if that's all right with you.
- Of course.
Great.
Well, I'll put some money in my meter.
What are you doing?
I can't have coffee with her.
Why not?
Obviously, she's still interested.
I'm seeing Cassandra, for God's sakes.
I can't date two people at once.
Well, it doesn't have to be on the same night.
If you're good at faking a headache, don't mind getting changed in the car Roz.
Well, did you tell Cassandra you were gonna be exclusive to her?
No.
So then you're just dating.
Relax.
It's supposed to be fun.
Just see where it takes you.
That sort of lifestyle's all right for some people but not for me.
I'm a one-woman man, if that.
Okay, suit yourself.
Keep it platonic.
Well, that's easy for you to say.
How do you tell somebody that you're attracted to them but you just can't sleep with them?
I guess you just say You just say I'll ask around.
You know what I feel like this morning?
Some French toast and sausage patties.
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.
Oh, hot.
You're not giving him any toast, are you?
Of course not.
- Oh, morning.
- Oh, hey.
- Morning.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.
Did you have a date?
Well, I guess that answers that.
Well, ease up there.
Cassandra's a great gal.
Women like her don't come along every day.
Morning.
No, they certainly don't.
Dad, Daphne, you remember Faye?
- Hi, Martin, it's good to see you again.
- Oh, yeah, likewise.
And, Daphne, you look gorgeous.
Did you get your hair cut since the last time I saw you?
Oh, yes, I did.
Thank you.
Can I fix you some breakfast?
I have really gotta run.
I'm running late.
I have to call my friend at the museum to get tickets for that Seurat exhibit.
- I just hope it's not sold out.
- Well, if it is, que Seurat Seurat.
Yeah, that was funnier the first time.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What happened to Cassandra?
Obviously, he dumped her for someone better.
I haven't dumped anyone.
You mean you're dating both of them?
Oh, no, I didn't intend to.
It's just that, well I ran into Faye.
I was about to tell her about Cassandra.
It's just that we were enjoying our coffee so much that coffee turned into dinner, and then dinner turned into drinks, and then drinks turned into, well, coffee again.
Damn, I completely forgot I rescheduled squash with Niles.
Don't be angry at me for still being in my robe.
I won't.
I wish I were in mine.
Cassandra, what a surprise.
- I brought you some pastries.
- Isn't that thoughtful of you?
- Here we are.
- Hi, Martin, Dixie.
Cassandra!
It's You know, I'd love it if you could stay.
I've got to go pick up my brother for squash.
- Morning, all.
- Well, isn't that a timesaver.
You know, I've still gotta go get dressed anyway.
And I'll just see you back at the station.
- Okay.
All right.
Have a good game.
- All right.
Bye.
Oh, you know, I'll just use the powder room before I go.
Yeah.
This is a disaster!
- What is?
- Hi, Niles.
Oh, I'm up to speed.
- Morning.
- Well, I guess I'll just be - What?
- We just noticed: There's a nest of baby hummingbirds on the balcony, and we're just keeping our voices down.
You run along.
Hummingbirds made it to the 19th floor?
Yes, well, they're Himalayan mountain hummers.
- They're very rare.
Bye-bye.
- Okay.
I'll see you later.
- What are you doing?
- I was just standing guard.
You know, the door is The lock's broken on it.
Sometimes Dad just wanders in, you know.
Well, I know you've got your game.
- I'll just get out of your hair.
- Right.
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.
Aren't I gonna get a hug first?
Come on.
Oh, of course.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes.
It's just, you're so hard to say goodbye to.
Well, time's a-wasting.
Off you go.
- Bye-bye.
- All right.
Got any more hiding in the grotto, Hef?
Oh, for God's sakes.
Oh, I'm just not up to this sort of thing.
What made me think I could juggle?
I sure as hell don't know.
You couldn't catch a balloon till you were 10.
Yes, thank you, Dad.
My problem is that each of them appeals to different sides of my personality.
Faye is artistic and cerebral and cultured.
And Cassandra is passionate and fun and spontaneous.
Well, my vote sure goes for Cassandra.
Oh, you would say that.
Any young woman who shows you any attention, you're ready to sign over your pension cheque.
- I think he should go for Faye.
- Oh, Faye, Faye.
If he wants some boring, artsy-fartsy conversation he's got Niles.
Yes, well, my point is I am really torn here.
I feel as if I honestly cannot choose.
I think I might be able to help you with this.
Heads, it's Faye.
Tails, Cassandra.
Oh, this is the sort of thing that makes a woman feel really special.
You're gonna flip a coin?
The decision cannot be made that simply.
It's not gonna be that simple.
The chances of Niles catching that quarter - are about the same as you - Enough, Dad!
Just go with me on this, Frasier.
Heads, it's Faye.
Tails, Cassandra.
And the winner is Admit it.
You want me to say one name more than the other.
Niles, you're right, I do.
Cassandra.
Yes!
- There you have it.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Niles.
Well, what a relief.
You know, my life was perfectly happy before Faye came back, you know.
Yes, it's Cassandra.
She's the one.
Next time I see Faye, I'll just have to tell her it's over.
Oh, gosh, Niles, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid we've lost our court again.
Do you mind rescheduling just once more?
- All right, that's fine.
- I gotta hand it to you, Frasier.
You had a tough decision to make but you made it.
Heck, I can't even decide whether to have the strawberry or the grape jelly.
Dad, I still have my trusty quarter.
Let's say heads, grape.
Tails, strawberry.
Niles, Niles!
Are you all right?
You gotta wonder what goes on on that squash court.
You know what I could go for this morning?
A big old Spanish omelette.
Here's your bran flakes.
What's that?
Your yellow bowl broke in the dishwasher.
- Well, don't you have another one?
- Afraid not.
Well, red, yellow, what difference does it make?
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry.
Oh, hot.
You know, I don't like this red bowl.
It's throwing everything off.
You know, I think we do have another yellow bowl.
Why don't you go and sit down, and I'll fetch it for you?
Okay.
Back off.
I need this.
Oh, good morning, Dad.
Everything go all right with Faye last night?
She didn't take the breakup too hard, did she?
- Not really.
- Well, I'm sure she realises, pretty as she is, that she won't be alone for long.
Good morning, Martin.
What'd I tell you?
Hi, how you doing?
I'll get this.
I had an incredible time last night.
Me too.
Morning, all.
Oh, forget it.
- Niles.
- Frasier.
I'm glad you're here.
Listen, I am so sorry about this morning.
Oh, not at all.
I ended up playing an exhilarating game with Chip Emory.
Won two out of three sets.
And if you recall, Chip was club champion four years running.
Yes, and I also recall that that record comes with an asterisk.
I believe his streak was interrupted by World War II.
It was Korea, and you know it.
Can I have my usual, please?
Why was Faye at your apartment this morning?
Well, actually, I almost made a terrible mistake.
Last night, I was prepared to break things off with her, then we fell into this marvellous conversation about architecture.
And as it turns out, she detests the design of the Bilbao Art Museum as much as I do.
- And you almost let her go.
- Yes, exactly.
And, well, you know, Cassandra's a wonderful woman, but Well, Faye and I have a deeper connection and to be fair, actually, she was the first to plant her flag on "terra Frasier".
I'm starting to think Napoleon had a Frasier complex.
Yes, all right.
Oh, there's Cassandra.
I asked her here for coffee.
I was gonna tell her - that we can't see each other.
- Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you, Niles.
- Cassandra?
- Hi, honey.
Hi.
Double espresso, please.
- I have great news.
- Really?
Those new promos are working wonders.
I just got the numbers, and you're scoring with women between the ages of 25 and 49.
Well, that's not always a good thing.
You all right?
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about our relationship.
- You see, l - I know where we're going.
A serious talk.
You see, there comes a time in every relationship - when you have to decide - I know.
Whether we're going to be exclusive or not.
I've been wanting to talk to you about that too.
- You have?
- Yes, you see I thought you should know that I've been seeing someone else.
Really?
Does that bother you?
No.
No, no, no, actually, not at all.
Oh, good.
Anyway, what I wanted to say was that Well, how long you been seeing this other fellow?
Not very long.
You're not upset, are you?
No, no, no.
Actually, I was about to say Well, what does he do?
He owns his own venture-capital firm.
Although he spends most of his time racing sailboats and rebuilding trails for the Sierra Club.
Oh, really?
Seems a little unfocused, doesn't he?
- You are upset, aren't you?
- No, no, no.
Really, there's no reason to be jealous of Sloane.
Believe me, I am not jealous of Sloane.
If anything, I pity the man who has to go through life with a pretentious name like that.
- Frasier.
- All right, fine, fine.
You know what, let's just drop the whole thing, all right?
Okay.
Now, about those new promos - Cassandra, I want us to be exclusive.
- What?
Yes, well, I'm the kind of person who can make a decision and commit to it.
And I was hoping that you might be that sort of person too.
Oh, Frasier, I'm so touched.
If you only want us to be with each other, that's great.
I was supposed to see Sloane tonight, but I'm gonna call him and cancel.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, my God.
That means we can spend the night together.
Looks like she took the news well.
Are you insane?
Niles, I almost made a terrible mistake.
What could have happened in the last four minutes to make you change your mind?
When Cassandra told me that she was seeing somebody else, it awakened something in me.
- Oh, petty jealousy?
- No.
The realisation that I couldn't bear to lose her.
The minute you see Faye, you'll reverse again.
No.
No, I won't.
I'll prove it to you.
Cassandra is the one.
I'm sure of it.
Her machine.
Yes, Faye, it's Frasier.
Listen, I won't be able to join you for dinner tonight.
But perhaps you could call me later.
We need to talk.
There, I've done it.
Nothing says it's over between us quite like the phrase: "We need to talk".
That was my problem, actually.
I kept leaving the door open.
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you, Niles.
An enlightened man is he who can learn from his mistakes.
Squash tomorrow morning?
- 9 a.m., my place?
- See you there.
Well, I called him.
I probably should feel guilty.
I'm just so glad it's just the two of us now.
I'm ecstatic.
I know a cute little bed-and-breakfast we can go to this weekend.
Oh, really?
Thank you.
What a relief this is.
I've made my choice.
Look at her.
I've found an angel.
An angel who wears an awful lot of makeup.
I've never noticed that before.
Faye doesn't paint her face up like that.
And they have the cutest little four-poster beds in each room.
That sounds lovely.
My, she uses the word "cute" a lot.
I'm cute.
This cafe is cute.
Now the bed is cute.
Faye used the word "jejune" last night.
Oh, you know, I meant to tell you.
I really liked how you handled that nasty caller yesterday.
It was such a clever way God, all she talks about is work, work, work.
And now I'll see her every morning before work, and at work, and after work.
I feel trapped.
I can't breathe.
Wait, what are you doing?
It's just your fear talking.
She's a wonderful woman.
She's the one.
She's perfect.
And then I ran into Roz after the show, and she told me the cutest little story Cassandra, we need to talk.
- Frasier?
- Faye, hi.
- We really need to talk.
- I know, I got your message.
- I thought you couldn't see me tonight.
- Well, I had some unfinished business with the Promotions Department, but that's all done now.
I wish you would've called.
I would've put something on.
No, no, you look beautiful.
Listen, Faye, I want us to be exclusive.
What?
Yes, I wanna take our relationship to the next level.
I just wanna be with you.
I'm a little surprised.
You said, "We need to talk" on the machine, and, you know, that usually means it's over.
Really?
I had no idea.
Well, this is wonderful.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God, so it's just you and me.
God, this is exhilarating.
Oh, this is turning out to be the best day ever.
Because Well, okay, Chris McKenna, the restaurant critic, he comes over to the restaurant this morning What is she thinking with that ridiculous shirt?
Tie-dye?
Stop it, Frasier.
You can't do this to yourself.
This is nothing more than the natural panic of finally making your choice.
- That the printer had messed up and the menu said "flab" instead of "flan".
That is so precious.
And so is she.
Precious.
My Faye.
Faye as in favourite.
This feels so much better now that I've relaxed.
I was about to doom this whole relationship with my neurotic nitpicking.
But it's clear sailing now.
Well, enough about me.
How was your day?
Well, it certainly ended well.
Although, you know, something funny did happen at the station.
It was during the second hour of my show.
My God, he really does love to talk about himself.
Is that another new pair of shoes?
He's got more shoes than I do.
- Didn't really work out, but
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Good show today, Roz.
- Yeah.
- Say, why all the catalogues?
- I need to buy a present.
Tiffany, Cartier, Neiman Marcus - Anything look good to you here?
- Well, let's see.
Who could we be shopping for?
Perhaps a honey-voiced radio therapist whose birthday's just around the corner?
No, this present is not for you.
It's for your brother.
Oh, all right, Roz, listen, don't be coy.
I think it's very smart, your fishing for hints like this.
You want to avoid a misstep like you made last year.
What misstep?
You said you loved Pagliacci.
Yes, the opera, not the little porcelain crying clown figurine.
Look, Niles pulled some strings and got Alice on a list for a really good preschool so I thought I'd get him a thank-you gift.
That's why I was asking for your stupid opinion in the first place.
- But forget it.
- All right, fine.
- I'll figure it out for myself.
- Have it your own way.
Fine.
But I tell you what, don't get him a porcelain Pagliacci.
He already has one.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.
You'll never guess who I just saw.
I went over for a cup of coffee with Hank.
You remember Hank?
He's the security guard who works at Weston's Jewellery Store.
Anyway, we were in his booth, just shooting the breeze and looking at the surveillance monitors, and who do I see buying an engagement ring but Donny.
As in Daphne and Donny.
Donny?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Engagement rings is Tina's counter.
We use the zoom lens on her.
- Dad, I'm shocked.
- Oh, no, it's just innocent fun.
She only dresses that way because she knows we're looking at her.
I mean about Daphne and Donny.
I didn't realize they were this serious.
- They spend all that time together.
- This is gonna crush Niles.
- Yeah, I know.
- Do you think we should tell him?
No, it's none of our business.
We do not tell Niles and we definitely do not tell Daphne.
- Tell Daphne what?
- Nothing.
- It's bad news, isn't it?
- No, it's not bad news.
Is it about my mum?
Did they find something during her physical?
They did, didn't they?
I have to call her.
No, Daphne, no, no, no.
There is absolutely no news.
And even if there were, it's not up to us to tell you about it.
Who should tell me, then?
Head surgeon?
Our family minister?
- No!
- No!
The mortician?
God, I've gotta pack.
I hope I'm not too late.
I just saw Donny buying you an engagement ring.
That is the news.
Really?
I don't believe it.
I'm gonna get married.
God, I'm so excited.
I'm gonna be a missus.
Mrs. Donny Douglas.
Mrs. Donald Ronald Douglas.
Oh, God!
Yes, well, I guess we're gonna have to prepare Niles now.
- He's on his way over here.
- Yeah, well, don't tell him here.
I don't want him going to pieces in front of Daphne.
Yes, I guess I can tell him at the restaurant.
Well, just don't take him to one of those fancy wine bistros that you guys love.
News like this calls for hard liquor in big glasses.
Wherever it is, I just think it's best that Niles hear it from me - and not from Daphne.
- Hear what from Daphne?
I'll tell you at the restaurant.
No, I don't wanna wait till we get to the bistro.
- You're just gonna have to wait.
- And you're not going to any bistro.
Well, fine.
If you won't tell me, then I'll just ask Daphne myself.
Niles, wait.
The truth is - Daphne's - Mother is dying.
- Dear God.
- Yes, tragic, isn't it?
Yes.
She's gonna need all the support that we can give her.
Evening, Dr. Crane.
Come on, Niles, we don't wanna lose our table.
- Did you hear the news?
- I just did.
What can I say?
I've thought about this day ever since I was a little girl.
I'm sure you have.
It's even better than I thought it would be.
I can already picture the big day.
Beautiful flowers everywhere, a sea of smiling faces.
I suppose everyone will want to have their picture taken with the lady of the hour.
You know, maybe Daphne could use a little quiet time.
No, who could be quiet?
I'm so happy.
Donny's gonna ask me to marry him.
- What?
- Now, come the big day, you'll all sit right up front with my family because that's what you are to me.
Family.
Well, that's what you are to us too, Daph.
Oh, I am so thrilled for you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, all.
I'm sorry, son.
- You wanna talk?
- No.
Frasier, if you wouldn't mind, I'm gonna cancel dinner.
- I need to be alone.
- Of course, Niles.
Look, if you need me, call.
Poor kid.
He'll be all right, Dad.
You know, Niles is a lot stronger than we give him credit for.
Hello?
Hold the elevator.
I'll be right there.
Hang in there, son, he's on his way.
Yes?
This came while you were in session.
It's from a Roz Doyle.
She wanted to thank you for a favour that you did.
- I'll be off now.
- All right.
Good night, Mrs. Woodson.
Come in, Mrs. Woodson.
I'm afraid it's me, Dr. Crane.
Daphne.
What are you doing here?
I know I should've called first, but I need to talk to you.
It's sort of a private matter and I hoped we could talk here.
Well, it's not really appropriate for me to act as your therapist, but if it's just advice from a friend that you need, I'm happy to lend an ear.
What's on your mind?
Well I don't think I can marry Donny.
I think there's someone else I'm meant to be with.
Who is it?
- It's Mrs - Oh, for God's sake, go home!
Sorry for that interruption.
Anyway, this man you're meant to be with, who is he?
I'm afraid I can't say.
Yes, you can.
We're the only ones here.
Are you sure you won't laugh at me?
How could you think I would laugh at you?
Most people would if I told them I'd seen the love of my life in a psychic vision.
Well, most people are What?
You know how I have these psychic flashes from time to time.
Well, I had one last night.
You had a vision about the love of your life.
Okay.
Well, tell me about it.
Here.
And, Daphne, omit nothing.
All right.
I was straightening up the living room when I had a sudden flash of a wedding ceremony for Donny and me.
Oh, it was lovely.
The church was packed to the rafters.
Me mum was there in a peach silk looking very smart, me brothers in their suits I may have led you in the wrong direction with the omit-nothing business.
Feel free to skip ahead.
Right.
Well, my father had just walked me up to the altar and I was standing there facing Donny.
He looked quite natty.
Black tuxedo, tails, very slender.
We're skipping.
Well, then the vicar began the ceremony.
He asked if anyone had a reason why we shouldn't wed and that's when this Well, this person stood up and said that he did.
He said that he was the true love of my life, though he'd never had the courage to say so.
I feel so awkward telling you all this.
Don't.
I think I know who this person is.
- You do?
- Yes.
Well, I don't see how you could.
I couldn't tell myself.
He was standing in the shadows and I couldn't see his face.
All I could make out was that he was wearing a red bow tie.
I don't have a clue why anyone would wear such a thing to a wedding.
Heavens, I can't believe I'm talking about my visions to a psychiatrist.
Your brother would think I was daft.
Well, Frasier's never really shared my mystical, spiritual bent.
This does mean I'm gonna have to turn down Donny's proposal.
- You don't think that would be crazy?
- Not at all.
Then you really believe in psychic visions too?
I do.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
That means a lot to me.
Of course, if I can't marry Donny, I can't very well go on dating him.
- That would just be leading him on.
- That's very true.
I don't know how I'm gonna break it off with him.
Well, do you wanna write a letter?
I have stationery and a fax machine.
No.
I have to tell him to his face.
I do hate to let him go, though.
I know it's hard, but it's the only ethical thing to do.
You're right.
Now I see why people come to you.
You always point them in the right direction.
Well, I'd be a poor excuse for a psychiatrist if I didn't.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.
What's Eddie doing?
Every time this cooking show comes on, he rolls over and watches it upside-down.
He likes all the pouring they do.
He thinks it's funny the way the food goes up instead of down.
- Evening.
- Hey, Daph.
Donny called, said he'd be here about 8.
Do you think he'll pop the question tonight?
I hope not.
What's the matter?
I've decided to break up with him tonight.
What?
You wanted to marry him yesterday.
Well, you know how I have these visions from time to time.
- And don't tell Dr. Crane.
Well - Don't tell me what?
- Nothing.
- It's my car again, isn't it?
It's not your bloody car.
She's breaking up with Donny because of some vision.
I asked you not to mention that.
What vision?
I know you'll make fun of me.
But I had a vision that I'm meant to be with another man.
- Who?
- I couldn't see his face.
I don't know anything about him.
He was just wearing a red bow tie.
You're seriously gonna dump Donny because of some psychic vision?
Don't you think that's a little unwise?
Well, your brother didn't think so.
- Niles knows about this?
- Yes.
He helped me to see that ending things with Donny was my only choice.
Unlike you, he believes in my visions.
He knows I have a gift.
Yes.
He's been trying to unwrap it for six years.
That'll be Donny.
What do you think about all this vision stuff?
There's some psychological reason that she's having second thoughts.
It's got nothing to do with an apparition in a red bow tie.
Niles, you jackass, will you take that thing off?
I admit it's a departure for me, but I'm feeling a bit kicky today.
Yes, I know.
Daphne told us you encouraged her to follow her vision and to dump Donny.
I'm astonished at your lack of integrity.
Now, will you take that damn thing off?
What did you hope to accomplish with that?
I was simply trying to nudge Daphne into the realisation that I am the man in her vision.
Niles.
All right.
But why else would she come to me?
Surely, you of all people realise that there is some psychological basis for these visions of hers.
It represents a fear of some kind.
A fear of intimacy, a fear of commitment, a fear of the Windsor knot.
Who knows?
- Wasn't that Donny at the door?
- No, no, just Niles, Daphne.
You know, we were just discussing these visions of yours.
Look, I'm in no mood to be mocked.
I'm not mocking you, Daphne.
And I'm not trying to influence you in any way either.
It's just that I was wondering Have these psychic warnings ever come to you before?
Say, at a critical juncture in a relationship.
No.
Well, actually, yes.
Once when my first boyfriend proposed, I had a vision telling me there was someone better waiting, which there was, Clyde.
But you dumped Clyde.
Look, I don't have time for this right now.
Oh, yes, no fear of commitment there.
Well, it's just as possible that she knew those men were wrong for her.
- Isn't that right, Dad?
- Leave me out of this.
- I'm just looking for my TV Guide.
- Well, I could use a little support here.
Well, maybe that's why I said to leave me out of it.
I'm sorry, Niles.
I want you to be happy, but I'm with your brother on this.
Niles, the fact is, you don't know what causes these visions.
And yet you still advised her to walk away from a wonderful relationship.
It doesn't make you much of a psychiatrist.
That's your opinion.
Yes, well, here's a second opinion.
It doesn't make you much of a friend.
You sure you didn't throw it away with the recycling?
Are you actually looking for your TV Guide?
Well, I have to plan my weekend.
You really do have the world on a string, don't you, Dad?
Look, Daphne, I have been thinking about our talk this afternoon.
I'm not sure I gave you the best advice I could have.
Perhaps what you call a vision is really a fear, a fear of commitment, say.
That would explain why these visions come to you when your relationships turn serious.
Mind you, I can't tell you that I think Donny is the right person for you, but I wouldn't want you to end things with him for the wrong reasons.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
You're just like your brother after all.
This afternoon you were just humouring me, weren't you?
- No, Daphne.
- Look at the idiot from Manchester.
She thinks she has visions.
No, no.
I'm saying that I think there are psychological issues here that you just don't entirely appreciate.
Well, how could I?
I'm just some nut who believes in fate.
Well, I've always followed my vision and your pity's not gonna change that.
That'll be Donny.
Could one of you get the door?
Well, you've seen me do it enough times.
You just turn the handle and pull.
- Hello, Donny.
- Hi, Frasier.
- Hey.
- Is Daphne ready?
- She'll be out in a minute.
- That's good.
Great.
- What's that you're drinking there?
- Sherry.
Yeah, I'll have one.
So how's business?
Well, actually, I've cut down on my caseload because I wanna spend more time with Daphne.
Don't tell her this, but I've book us on an Alaskan vacation next month.
I hear it's one of the few places left where you can feel completely alone.
You like that feeling, huh?
- Donny.
- Oh, hi, honey.
- You look really great.
- You too.
Shall we be on our way, then?
Well, actually, I've got something on my mind that I'd kind of like to talk about first.
- Oh, well, we'll just get out of here.
- No, no, no, it's I'd like you to stay here for this.
If it wasn't for all of you, then I never would have met Daphne.
- Donny, I think it'd be best if - It's okay.
Sit.
Maybe I'll just have a little bit of this sherry.
You know, I thought that being a divorce attorney would've just soured me on relationships, and then I met you.
And now I find myself telling my clients to reconcile, because I think that if they could find even just a tiny little bit of the happiness that I've found with you, they could make it.
I've been thinking about that time we went to the little bed- and-breakfast in the country, and we sat in that porch swing all night and looked at the sky.
You told me that your dad and you used to sit on your stoop and do the same thing when you were a kid.
He said that the only man good enough for you would scoop the stars out of the sky with his hat and lay them at your feet.
Well I've I've only caught this one so far, but if you'll accept it, I'll spend my life chasing down the rest of them for you.
I know it's very soon, so just think about it.
I don't have to think about it.
Yes.
Oh, God, it's beautiful.
Oh, Donny.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Boys, give me a break.
You look more surprised than I do.
No, no.
No.
We're just so happy for you.
- Congratulations.
- Yes, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- If you'll excuse me, I need to - Yes, champagne.
Let me help you.
Oh, Niles.
I'm so sorry.
Frasier, why don't you take the champagne in there?
We're gonna stay out here for a second.
All right.
I'd do anything to fix this for you.
I know.
It's my own fault.
I had chance after chance to tell her how I feel, and I always kept my mouth shut.
Until tonight, when I probably should have.
Well, you can't regret what you said.
It was the right thing to do.
And that's something I can always count on from you.
Thanks, Dad.
I'm gonna get you some of that champagne.
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Oh, just a second, Dr. Crane.
I'm sorry I got cross with you.
Once I thought about what you said, it really made sense.
And then when Donny did ask me, it was fear I felt, just like you told me.
I figured the best way to overcome it was to just jump in with both feet.
Thank you for your help.
- I wish you the very best, Daphne.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't squeeze so hard.
That's a precious commodity right there.
My number one client here, you know.
- Still looking for that TV Guide?
- Yeah, it's the damnedest thing.
What are you still doing up?
Where's Donny?
He's on the phone with my folks.
He really is wonderful, Mr. Crane.
I'm very happy for you, Daph.
Oh, my God.
I just had that vision again.
Only this time Oh, that's a bit scary.
My mystery man is standing with some sort of dragon.
- A dragon?
- Yes.
That makes no sense.
It must be just what Dr. Crane said.
- These visions are about my fears.
- I guess.
Imagine spending the rest of my life looking for some poor bloke with a dragon.
- That's weird.
- What?
I just had a vision myself.
What is it?
There's a mystery woman.
She's standing in the kitchen.
She's making me a Monte Cristo sandwich.
- Oh, brother.
- No, no, it's just a grilled cheese.
Make it yourself, you lazy old goat.
Oh, Roz.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Oh, hey, Niles.
- Hey, Roz.
Oh, God, do you realise how pathetic this is?
It's 9:30 on a Saturday night and neither one of us are surprised to see the other one here alone.
Never seen this place looking so grim.
This is Mardi Gras compared to half an hour ago when it was just me and an elderly gentleman who cleaned his teeth with his coffee stirrer and then put them back in his mouth.
- Let me get the waitress.
- Oh, God, not her.
I hate her.
She's in my spinning class at the gym.
I've been killing myself trying to take off these last five pregnancy pounds, and nothing.
Meanwhile, she's down at the snack bar stuffing her face and waving to everybody, acting all friendly.
She's such a phoney.
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Kit.
You were great in class tonight.
Are you kidding?
I've been such an oinker lately.
- What can I get you?
- Oh, a non-fat latte for me.
Coming right up.
See what I mean?
She's such a fake.
I'm sorry, Roz, I'm afraid I'm not gonna be very good company tonight.
Well, whatever your problems are, you'll laugh at them when you hear what I've been through.
I had a date tonight, but halfway down the driveway, he called me on my car phone and cancelled.
So I was too humiliated to go back in the house and face the sitter.
So don't ask me why, I went to the zoo.
You wanna feel good about yourself?
Put on your best outfit and walk through the monkey house on a Saturday night.
And be sure to stop by and see Remo the Baboon who knows all kinds of ways to have fun without a date.
Feeling better about your problem?
Daphne and Donny got engaged yesterday.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, and lucky me, I had to sit there and watch, horrified.
Wasn't a thing I could do to stop it, much like your monkey-house experience.
I am so sorry, Niles.
You really did have a worse night than I did.
- Hey, Roz.
- Wait, I'm gaining on you.
Isn't this a splendiferous surprise?
- So, Roz, Dr. Crane, is this a date?
- No, no, no, just a chance meeting.
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.
So, Roz, where is this person you told me you had a date with?
- That got cancelled.
- Oh, "cancelled," you say.
And here you are showing up at my regular Saturday-night hangout.
Will the coincidences never stop?
Perhaps you'd care to join me for a late supper.
No, Noel.
As I said earlier today, I am really not in the mood.
Playing hard to get, I see.
It's all part of the mating dance.
Watch and learn.
- Morning.
- Oh, Niles.
Armani at 8 in the morning on a Sunday?
Yes, yes, I'm having lunch with Maris.
With Maris?
Yeah, we scheduled this weeks ago.
She still has some of my first editions.
I thought she'd be amenable to returning them if I took her to her favourite bistro.
Well, then the worst you're out is a cup of clear broth.
No, no, this is lunch.
She takes her large meal in the evening.
I'm sorry to barge in so early.
I had to get out of the Montana.
The couple next door were just married.
They kept me up all week with their boisterous lovemaking.
Why is it that when you're by yourself, there's nothing but couples in love rubbing it in your face?
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi.
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?
- Well, actually - Oh, come on, you've got to.
I brought some pastries.
I didn't even hear you two come in last night.
Yeah, well, we got in kind of late.
We took a long walk after dinner.
Yeah, it was great.
The streets were deserted, it was all misty out.
It was like we were the only two people in town.
I wonder if Maris would rather have breakfast than lunch.
No, Niles, here, put that down.
Wait, now, Frasier, if Niles wants to leave Dad, there is no reason for Niles to feel awkward.
You're here, it's not like he's some third wheel.
Good morning.
Hey.
You boys remember Bonnie from McGinty's.
- Yes.
- I was at the Super Bowl, remember?
- I brought the ham loaf.
- Well, who could forget?
We talked about it long after.
It came up almost daily.
Aren't you sweet.
- I'm just gonna get some coffee.
- Okay.
You could've told me you were having Faye over.
Well, I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't realise you were seeing Bonnie.
I see her from time to time.
- You got a problem with Bonnie?
- Well, no.
If you're bringing it up, I have second thoughts about Faye.
I liked the other one you were seeing, Cassandra.
- She was a dish.
- Look, I don't care.
I prefer Faye.
I had to make a choice, no matter how much fun it was dating two beautiful women.
This morning just gets better and better.
- Who wants coffee and pastry?
- Oh, nothing for me, thanks.
Are you sure?
I make a mean nut cake.
No, that's all right, I'm meeting one for lunch.
So, Bonnie, I see you've met Cassandra.
- Who?
- Oh, Lord, I'm sorry.
- Faye.
- Who's Cassandra?
My Aunt Cassandra, yes, that must be the connection.
So you remind me a bit of her.
And, God, she was an angel, wasn't she, Dad?
Oh, Cassandra?
Great gal.
I wish she was around.
Eddie, good morning.
I bet you can't wait to meet Lady.
Yeah, we're getting Eddie together with Bonnie's poodle.
We figure if we hit it off, maybe something will happen for them.
Even dogs deserve happiness.
Okay, well, I'll be off.
Oh, hold on, you've got a loose button right there.
- No, no, it's all right.
No, no, please - No, it's about to come off.
See?
Here, I'll sew it back on for you.
I've got needle and thread.
- You don't wanna lose it, do you?
- I'm trying not to.
- Frasier, I have to get out of here.
- Niles, Niles, listen, just relax.
There's no cause for an anxiety attack.
Come on.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Breathe into this.
I didn't know you were here last night.
Why doesn't someone say something?
We planned on going to my place, but we ended up at a little piano bar just around the corner from here.
It was such a charming spot, so intimate.
And to top it off, the piano player knew all my favourite songs.
"Yesterday," "As Long as He Needs Me," "Climb Ev'ry Mountain".
Wow, you threw him some real curves there.
Hi.
I'm Donny Douglas, and I'm in love.
Listen to him.
He embarrasses me like that at least ten times a day.
And I just can't get enough of it.
- How are we coming on the button?
- I almost got the needle threaded.
You know, if anybody's hungry, we've got plenty of goodies here from Le Cigare Volant.
- Cassandra's the pastry chef there.
- She is?
I thought I was.
I'm so sorry.
God, I did it again.
I guess I must have her name on my mind.
Well, that's okay, just try to remember mine.
- Faye.
- Yeah, Faye, of course.
Oh, Faye.
I'm kind of glad this worked out.
Neither Daphne nor I has any family here in Seattle.
What I'd like to do is I'd like to make this our engagement breakfast surrounded by friends who treat us like family.
And I'd like to dedicate it to the woman who's filled my life with a joy I never thought I'd find.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
Oh, Marty, I'm gonna cry.
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, my God, look at that ring.
That's it for today.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying goodbye and good mental health.
Nice job there, Roz.
Could you try to find callers that have real psychological problems?
Your dad's on line two.
I meant during the show, thanks.
Yeah, Dad, hi.
What?
Again?
Well, that's the third time he's cancelled this week.
You know, if he's been so Ionely, you'd think he'd be glad for my company.
Well Well, all right, no matter.
I guess I'll see you at home in a while.
Well, I don't know, later.
I don't know, maybe an hour, two hours, I don't know.
Oh, for God's sake.
Look, just hang a tie on the door if you're so worried about it.
Is everything okay, Frasier?
Oh, yeah, yeah, Roz.
I was just thinking about something.
You know, it's funny how Ioneliness can make people behave in strange ways.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, do things that are sort of rash, you know, act out of character.
I knew someone would find out about it.
Who told you?
Did he tell you?
- I'll kill him.
- Roz.
Please, Frasier, don't tell anybody else.
Oh, I beg you.
It was one night.
One Ionely, stupid night.
What are you talking about?
- You don't know?
- No.
What happened?
- Nothing.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- No, Roz, Roz, Roz.
Stay right here.
Now, you listen to me, I am your friend, you know that.
I would never judge you.
Now, just how stupid and Ionely were you?
It's the last person I ever would have dreamed of.
I just guess I haven't been I haven't been dating much lately, and I've just been so Ionely.
Oh, my God, you slept with Noel.
No!
Oh, how could you even think such a thing?
All right, now, listen, listen, just tell me.
Now, who was it?
Nobody.
It doesn't matter.
It was a mistake.
It's over.
I just wanna forget it ever happened.
No, Roz, Roz, listen, you know, we've all been there.
Come on, you were just looking for a little comfort.
It's all right.
No reason to beat yourself up about it.
Hey, baby, I'm sorry I had to skip out before breakfast.
- Oh, Bulldog.
- Bulldog?
- Bulldog.
- Bulldog!
Oh, Frasier, swear you won't tell anybody else.
So you told the doc, huh?
Guess you just had to brag, huh?
Hey, hey, I don't blame you.
I told a few guys myself.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- Gee, where have I heard that before?
- I'll just leave you two alone.
- I'm right behind you.
- Gee, where have I heard that before?
Stop that.
Look, Bulldog, last night was a mistake.
I will regret it for the rest of my life.
And if you ever bring it up again, I promise you, you will regret it.
Hey.
- Your place tonight.
- Ten o'clock.
Use the service elevator.
- How's the speech coming along?
- Oh, it's almost finished.
So though you are graduating today, your learning is just begun.
There's something in the cushions back here.
- What, you found something?
- Yeah, it's Oh, it's a cell phone.
Is this Frasier's?
No, he had his when he left for work this morning.
Must be his brother's.
I'll tell him the next time he's over.
I'm gonna finish tidying up the kitchen.
Hello.
- Hey, Fras.
- Hello, Donny.
Hope I didn't come home at an inconvenient moment.
No, your timing's perfect, actually.
One egg roll left.
- Nice hands.
- Yes, they were.
- Here's your drink.
- Oh, thanks.
Isn't she great?
She takes me on a three-mile run and then feeds me diet soda.
I thought I'd hate healthy living, but, you know, it ain't so bad.
Daphne, why are you wearing that rubber glove?
What, this?
I was doing the dishes.
- With just one?
- It's the English way.
You wash with the left, dry with the right.
Started during the war, I think, when rubber was rationed.
Oh, yes.
- Can I see you in the kitchen?
- Yes, of course.
Let me just call Niles first.
He cancelled on me again today.
I'll just be a second here.
I just gotta check up on a case I'm finishing.
Poor bastard, I'm really taking him to the cleaners.
Well, perhaps you'd be so kind as to bring the couch along.
Yes, Daphne?
I'm afraid a terrible thing has happened.
- I've lost my engagement ring.
- Where was the last place you saw it?
Well, that's just it, I've searched everywhere.
I'm terrified Donny will find out.
You can't go around hiding your hand forever.
You're gonna have to tell him.
He's a reasonable man, he'll understand.
I suppose you're right.
No, you're negligent, pal.
You're criminally irresponsible.
You were careless and you're gonna pay for it.
Yeah.
- Here you go, boss.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Daph?
- Yes, love?
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just stuffing the bird for Dr. Crane's dinner.
Listen, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to work late.
I'm gonna just pop in the shower and leave.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, that's okay.
Absence just makes the heart grow fonder.
You know, Daphne, if that ring never turns up, that chicken works too.
Just see how it catches the light.
Oh, stop it.
I'm just gonna have another look in the bedroom.
All right.
Yeah, hello?
Niles, it's Frasier.
Yes, listen, I've tried you at your office, I've tried you at home, now I'm calling your cell phone.
If I don't reach you now, I'm actually going to get very worried about you.
Hello?
Yes, hello.
Is Niles Crane there, please?
I don't know, I just got here.
Let me go check.
Frasier, have you seen Niles?
- I'm just trying to reach him, Dad.
- Oh, okay.
No, I'm sorry, he's not here, but I'll write your name down and give it to him.
Wait a minute, I gotta find a pen.
- Fras, have you seen?
- Dad, please, I'm on the phone.
Well, I'm sorry, I was just looking for a pen.
Forget it.
Hello?
Listen, could you maybe call back in an hour?
- Dad.
- Would you mind, please?
I'm on the phone.
Dad, it's me.
Frasier, what are you doing?
Why'd you call from the kitchen?
- You could have just walked in here.
- Just hang up the phone.
For God's sake, it must be Niles' cell phone Gee, that's strange.
You know, he's never without that phone.
And what's more, he's been avoiding me for the last three days.
Oh, cut him a little slack.
Seeing the six of us the other morning couldn't have done much for his mood.
He's probably just gone off somewhere to be by himself.
I just hope he hasn't done something foolish.
Remember, he was having brunch with Maris on Sunday.
Oh, that was just business.
Yeah.
Well, you know, Dad, he is broken-hearted.
People in his condition have a tendency to run back to their exes.
A Ionely man clinging to an available warm body.
Well, of course, in Maris' case, that's just an expression.
He just spent two years divorcing her, he's not gonna go back to her.
Yeah, I hope you're right.
Say, didn't you have plans today with Bonnie?
No, it was cut short.
- We had an incident.
- What happened?
Well, we took the dogs to this park near Bonnie's, and I knew there'd be a little sizing each other up and everything, but this poodle of hers, Lady, which she ain't, walks up to Eddie, knocks him over, and then sits her big French butt right on his head.
- You're kidding.
- No.
And the worst thing was he just laid there whimpering and took it.
And Bonnie, she thought it was really cute.
I mean, what kind of a person likes to see a dog humiliated?
Dad, may I remind you that not a holiday goes by that you don't dress that dog up in some sort of ridiculous hat?
There's nothing wrong with those hats.
He looks good in hats.
He's got a hat face.
Well, he was probably just intimidated being in Lady's park, you know?
Wait till he gets over to this side of town.
He owns that park.
Even the big dogs are scared of him.
That's because they've seen him in his hats, they think he's crazy.
It's Niles' cell phone.
Hello?
Niles Crane's phone.
Yes, it's his brother.
I'll be glad to tell him.
Thank you.
Well, that was St. Pierre Jewelers.
The diamond earrings Niles ordered are ready.
Diamond earrings?
From Maris' favourite jeweller.
You know what?
He's too ashamed to tell us that he's run back to her.
Oh, now, stop that, you're scaring me.
He doesn't have to be with Maris.
Maybe he's hurt.
Maybe he's in a hospital or something.
We've got to track him down and talk some sense into him.
We'll head over to the Montana.
If he's not there, we'll go to Maris'.
Well, I don't wanna go to Niles' and I sure don't wanna go to Maris'.
This is not about what you or I want, this is about what Niles needs.
The man is devastated, he's vulnerable.
We need to rally around him, show him our support.
- Why didn't we do this on Sunday?
- We had our girlfriends over.
Dad, what are you doing back there?
What are you so worried about?
What do you think?
Running into Maris.
You know how angry she gets.
I just wish we had a sharp stick or a heavy net or something.
- Niles.
- Yes?
Where have you been?
You haven't even answered any of my calls.
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.
No, no, no.
I wanna talk to you right now.
Well, I can't, I'm entertaining, so off you go.
We're not leaving without you.
Put on your shower shoes and a coat.
- Let's get out of here.
- What is wrong with you?
I know how difficult the last three weeks have been for you, but I am sorry, you are making a big mistake.
This is not the way to handle it.
- So you know what's going on?
- Yes, Niles.
How did this whole thing even get started?
Well, we had an impromptu coffee at the Café Nervosa, and that led to a movie, and that led to dinner, and then ever since then, we've been practically inseparable.
And to tell you the truth, we're kind of happy about it.
How do you even know about this?
Your jeweller called.
Your diamond earrings are ready.
Oh, well, thank you for the message.
Now, go away.
No, Niles, no.
I'm sorry, we're not going anywhere.
You may consider this a full-blown intervention.
We're not leaving until you have got some self-respect back.
Niles, you know what we should do tonight?
Oh, hi.
Build a fire and make Smores.
Might also wanna get some graham crackers.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know we had company.
- No, no, that's okay, Kit.
This is - Wait, I know you from the café.
Cappuccino, light foam.
And you too, coffee black, nothing fancy.
Isn't that good?
Kit, this is my father, Martin, and my brother, Frasier.
- Yes, how do you do?
- Really?
I see it.
Cool.
You know, this is sort of a surprise.
I guess I didn't expect to see the two of you together.
Oh, I had my eye on him from the minute I saw him.
He's always so neat and put together.
I just wanted to mess him up.
And mission accomplished.
So, Niles, you haven't seen Maris then since Sunday?
Is that who you thought I was here with?
That's funny.
No wonder you were upset.
- Who's Maris?
- That's my ex-wife.
Oh, well, if you wanna see her too, that's cool.
I told you, no strings, just fun.
You always want your kids to have more than you had.
Niles, pick up, will you?
It's Frasier.
All right, fine.
Call me later.
I don't even know why I bother anymore.
He doesn't pick up phones these days, just waitresses.
Give him a break, he's just having fun.
That's what I'd expect to hear from someone willing to spend the night as Bulldog's squeak toy.
That is not funny.
It was one night, and I would appreciate it if you would just let it drop.
You're right, I'm sorry, that was tactless of me.
Let me make it up to you.
I've got an extra theatre ticket tonight.
Faye's busy.
Why don't you join me?
- No, thanks.
- No, please, Roz.
Look, it's a delightful little show, and I'll even throw in dinner.
- Busy.
- Really?
A date?
I have plans.
Plans.
What are you, a cop?
I got to account for every waking minute?
- My private life is my own business.
- Bulldog.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm weak, I can't stop myself.
- Yes, you can.
- Okay, I don't wanna stop myself.
He's good, he's really good.
I mean, I'm better, but he's trainable.
Roz, it's Bulldog.
Doesn't that bother you?
You'd think.
- Hey, doc.
- Bulldog.
Oh, Roz, you still gonna help me write those promos for my show tonight?
- Around 10:00?
- It's okay, Bulldog, he knows.
Yes, but high marks on that cryptic cover story.
Well, I gotta make a call.
Station manager's been calling me all day.
I made us a reservation.
Thought maybe we could get a little dinner first.
You mean eat together?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
That's beautiful, Roz.
- Oh, God, this ruins everything.
- What?
Well, didn't you hear what he said?
He wants to buy me dinner.
Do you realise what this means?
They finally opened that new Hooters out by the airport?
No, he's crossed the line.
He actually thinks we're dating.
Roz, didn't your mother warn you that sex could lead to things like dating?
Look, that is it.
I'm gonna put an end to this before it goes too far.
Can't believe it.
They just fired me.
What?
Yeah, said my ratings were low, show's losing its edge, I'm getting soft.
- My last day's Friday.
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm so sorry.
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.
This stinks.
This is total B.S. You don't think I'm getting soft, do you?
No, no, not at all.
Here.
I just thank God I got a girlfriend like you, Roz.
I don't think I could face this alone.
There, there.
Daphne.
- Morning, Dad.
- Hi.
Yes?
Daphne, please, Donny's not here.
Will you just take your hand out of the bag?
I was just undressing to take my bath, and I sat on the edge of the tub and landed on this.
Oh, my God, you found my ring.
I'd given up.
I thought it was some place I'd never find it.
It very nearly was.
- Come on, let me have it.
- No, rinse off this doodle dust first.
- Oh, right, of course.
- All right, yeah.
Well, you sure saved Daphne there.
Yes, I also did myself a little favour as well.
Can you imagine what conclusions Faye might have jumped to had she found this engagement ring in my room?
- Frasier, for me?
I had no idea.
- Well, actually It's beautiful.
It's so beautiful.
Yes, Frasier, I do, I do.
Oh, calm down, you big dope.
I know it's Daphne's ring.
And I can't tell you how flattered I am by those beads of sweat on your forehead.
No, they're love beads, honey.
Oh, God.
Will you take this thing?
Well, I don't want it.
What if Bonnie sees me with it?
Sees you with what?
Daphne, will you come in here and take this damn ring, please?
- Coming.
- Sit down, have a little coffee.
Good morning, everybody.
- Hi.
- Another full house, I see.
Yes, and that robe is available for purchase in the gift shop.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
- Oh, you found your ring.
- What?
You knew it was gone?
Well, Daphne, when your fiancée gives you a hug with a chicken on her hand, then bells go off.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay, honey.
I didn't wanna say anything.
I knew it'd turn up sooner or later, I didn't wanna make you feel worse.
As long as we're tying up loose ends, I was just wondering, what was your ring doing on the edge of my Jacuzzi tub right next to my favourite scented candle which was burned down to the wick?
I'm gonna let my attorney handle this one.
I'm sorry, Fras.
You know, I guess after a little champagne, we got into the mood and into the nude and into the tub.
So And, you know, don't worry, we'll replace the candle.
If only you could replace the image.
Next time, if you don't mind, would you just turn down the temperature a little?
Actually, we tried, but the knob was stuck.
Yeah, it does that.
You gotta jiggle it a little.
Don't worry, it's not what you think.
We use it to give Eddie a bath.
- Hey, guys, how are you doing?
- Hi, Dad.
- Morning.
- Nice to see you.
- Well, you're up early.
- You mean still up.
- We never went to bed.
- We'll get there.
- What'd you do all night?
- Oh, well, what didn't we do?
We started off at a concert, a wonderful group called Uncle Dirt Nap.
Then we danced the night away at every club in the U District before finding ourselves at an after-party at Kit's friend, Massimo's place.
He's a squatter.
Anyway, I wanted to give Kit the keys to my building, and I have a spare set here, so I thought we'd pop by.
- Well, then let me get them for you.
- Thanks.
I can offer you a pastry courtesy of Le Cigare Volant.
No, thanks.
You know, those things are loaded with bleached flour.
That stuff's poison.
Niles, give me your cell phone.
I'll call the travel agent.
- Oh, you going on a trip?
- Yeah.
He's taking me to France for the weekend, Euro Disney.
Massimo said we just had to go.
Apparently it is so lame it's cool.
Well, I should get going.
- Places to go, people to poison.
- I should get going too.
I'll pick up Lady and meet you and Eddie at the park at 10:30?
- Better make it 11.
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Bye.
Oh, bye, Bonnie.
- Bye, Frasier.
- Frasier, isn't she great?
- Oh, yes.
She's so free, so spontaneous.
She has breathed new life into me.
You may have to return the favour.
- Am I detecting disapproval?
- No, no, Niles, not at all.
I'm just Well, all right.
Don't you think you two are going just a bit quickly?
For the past year, you've told me I had to get over Daphne, find someone else.
Now I do, and all you can do is find fault?
Man, you are such a buzzkill.
Will you stop talking like that?
I'm just a little concerned, Niles.
You met this girl last week and she's spent every night with you.
You're giving her the keys to your apartment.
I think you're just jealous.
- Jealous?
- Yes.
Here I have attracted this untamed free spirit.
You're saddled with an uptight pastry chef whose name you can't remember.
Her name is Faye.
And I am not jealous, I'm just a little worried about you.
- I'm afraid you might get hurt.
- Oh, here we go.
Whatever would I do without my wise older brother to tell me what to do?
Frankly, you couldn't be acting more like a child.
You think I don't know the reason you came here?
It wasn't to get your keys, it was to show off Lolita's kid sister out there.
The two of you have absolutely nothing in common.
- Well, we're all set for Euro Disney.
- Oh, great.
You ready to go home?
- Oh, sure.
Bye, Frasier.
- Bye.
Oh, I'm so excited for this trip.
I'm gonna spend all my time in Fantasyland.
Oh, Niles, I'm sorry, I take it back.
You do have something in common.
Isn't that a darling sight?
Time was, when a waitress said, "Can I warm that up for you," she was talking about your coffee.
How was your date with Bulldog last night?
Hideous.
He took me to a nice restaurant, he bought me flowers, and then we went back to his place and cuddled.
All I could think of the whole time was, "How do I dump this loser"?
Oh, Roz.
He's meeting me here for coffee, and I'm ending this thing once and for all.
Yeah, well, good luck getting a cup of coffee.
You know, it's the funniest thing, he really does look happy, doesn't he?
- Yeah, so just leave it alone.
- Oh, maybe you're right.
Do you realise that this is the first time in recent history that all three Crane men have been in happy relationships?
Maybe I should be celebrating that fact rather than being such a buzzkill.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, Roz, plug in.
Hi, honey, it's Frasier.
Listen, I just read a marvellous review of this charming boîte out in Fremont, and I thought to myself, "That is a place that Cassandra would just love".
- So - Frasier.
- Not now, Roz, please - You just called her Cassandra.
Oh, dear God, I'm My producer, Roz, informs me that I just called you Cassandra.
I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep doing this.
I know that you're Faye.
Fabulous Faye.
Forever Faye.
Call me, Faye.
It is one syllable.
What the hell is wrong with me?
Well, I'm glad to see that you think it's funny.
No, I don't, I'm just I'm having a flashback to my summer of Ted, Todd and Tad.
- Hey, sports fans.
- Bulldog, hi.
You know what?
You may have my seat.
I'm gonna sit over there.
All right.
Hey, gorgeous.
You and I need to talk about what's been going on between us.
- I know.
- We're in public.
Look, look, I wanna tell you what's going on in here, okay?
- Bulldog, I don't wanna know - No, Roz, I gotta be honest with you.
This past week has been amazing.
But I met a total babe at Unemployment this morning and we're going to Hawaii this afternoon.
- What?
- I know, I know.
Getting dumped, ouch, it hurts like hell.
No, no, I don't believe this.
I came here to dump you.
Hey, whatever you gotta say to get through this, it's okay with me.
No, no, no, I know, I know.
I didn't mean to make you fall in love with me.
- I didn't, you repulse me.
- Hey, love hurts, Roz.
And I'm not talking about the time we fell off the kitchen table.
Aloha, old friend.
Bulldog, you cuddle lousy and I'm glad you got fired.
- Well, timing is everything.
- Back off, buzzkill.
- Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Dad.
Black coffee to go, please.
- You okay?
- I just broke it off with Bonnie.
Oh, gee, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
Lady humped Eddie.
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.
It was humiliating.
Yeah, but Eddie's a boy dog and Lady is, well, a lady.
Yes, well, that would be the humiliating part, now, wouldn't it?
Right in his own park in front of all these other dogs.
Yeah, Bonnie got a big kick out of it too.
- Sorry.
- And I told her off, and that was it.
Sorry, Dad.
- It's not funny.
- I know, I know, I know.
Was he wearing a hat?
No, no, Dad, Dad, please, come back, come on.
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey, Faye.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
I was near the station, so I thought I'd just see if you were around.
Well, great.
Oh, Roz, you remember Faye.
Hi, Faye.
You were going to say Cassandra, weren't you?
- Why would you think such a thing?
- Well, I just checked my messages.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why it keeps happening.
You just have this remarkable resemblance I know, I know, your aunt.
- I'll be right back.
- I have got to stop saying "Cassandra".
- Frasier.
- Cassandra.
- Hi, Roz.
- Hi, Cassandra.
- So how have you been?
- Great.
I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.
We've been sort of avoiding each other at work, and it just all seems so silly.
I mean, I really don't have any hard feelings about the way things ended between us.
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
You know, neither do I. You dumped me.
You're not allowed to have hard feelings.
Anyway, my life is great.
- I'm back together with Sloane.
- Oh, well You and I should have coffee some time.
That would be nice, yes.
I'm glad we're putting all this awkwardness behind us.
Me too.
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Well - Whoa, I gotta get back to work.
You going back to the station?
- Yes.
- Good, I'll walk with you.
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.
We better hurry.
- Bye, Frasier.
Bye-bye, Faye.
- Bye-bye, love you.
Yes, you do.
- Who was that?
- You know Roz.
- No, no, no, the other one.
- Oh, she's the promotions director.
- Yeah, well, she's gorgeous.
- Oh, you think so?
- I never really looked.
- Well, don't start looking now.
If I'm gonna stay, I should feed the metre.
Lucky metre.
- Hey, there, Frasier.
- Oh, Niles, hi.
Listen, Niles, I want to apologise for getting upset this morning.
I've been giving it some thought.
I think maybe Kit is just what the doctor ordered.
Is she ever.
And no strings, just fun, right?
- That's what she said.
- Exactly.
- So you really like her?
- Yes, I do.
- And you're not just saying that?
- Absolutely not.
You want her?
- Excuse me?
- Frasier, she's killing me.
I'm just not cut out for this lifestyle.
Between seeing myself in a mirror at the club dancing my modified Charleston and catching my reflection in a store window this morning as I Rollerbladed past in spandex I feel like I'm being stalked by some pathetic, middle-aged ghoul.
I just Obviously, I've gotta break it off with her.
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Niles.
You gonna tell her now?
No, no, no, I'll arrange to meet her after work.
Tell you the truth, I think she's losing interest herself.
I couldn't help notice a little eye-rolling today when my skate wheel got stuck in a storm grate.
And thanks for not saying "I told you so".
Hey, Kit, there's something I wanted to talk to you about later.
Just talk to me now.
You know you can tell me anything.
Well, yeah, I'd rather do it after your shift.
You have such a serious face.
What, are we breaking up or something?
Well Oh, my God.
You just dumped me right here where I work, in front of everyone I wait on?
- Okay, we'll go outside.
It's - Why?
Give me an answer!
- Kit, Kit, calm down.
It's all right.
- What, you're tired of me?
- Is that what it is?
- No, no.
- You've had enough of me?
- No, no, no.
I gave you everything, and you used me.
- No, no, no, honey - Sex, sex, sex!
The way you come to bed every night wanting it, begging for it!
- I never had to beg.
- I'm just a whore to you, aren't I?
No, don't say that.
Yes, I am.
Your whore, your whore from the café!
It was really more of a compatibility thing.
I'm recently divorced and I've been under a lot of strain.
Niles, no.
- It's been painful for everyone.
- They're strangers.
It's all right.
Let's just pick this up, shall we?
Here, you take that, I'll get this.
- What happened?
- I'm not really sure, actually.
- Just give me a minute, will you?
- Excuse me, is Frasier still here?
- I had something I needed to ask him.
- Oh, yeah, he's over there.
I didn't get a chance to meet you before.
- I'm Faye.
- Oh, how do you do?
I'm No!
Well, you know, this is a charming little place.
I live around the corner, I've never been in before.
What'll it be?
Martini, straight up, two olives, henceforth known as the usual.
- Hey.
- Niles.
I called Daphne.
She said you'd be here.
- Oh, yeah.
- It's a cosy room.
Guess it'll have to do, because the old whoremonger won't be going back to Nervosa any time soon.
Yeah, I'm pretty much exiled from Le Cigare Volant with Faye working there.
- Well, I plan to get stinking tonight.
- Thank you.
May I see your wine list?
Hey, guys.
- Dad.
- Dad.
What are you doing here?
Oh, saw Niles' car out front, so I thought I'd stop in for a drink.
I can't go to McGinty's anymore with Bonnie there.
And Eddie's taking a break from the park.
Well, come join us here on Elba.
- What can I get you?
- Jameson's on the rocks.
And I'll try the white.
Well, here we are again, losers in love.
Yeah.
You know, I don't know what's wrong with me.
I seem incapable of maintaining a relationship.
I date a nice girl like Faye, things seem to be working out.
I seem to find a way to blow it.
Seems to be the pattern of my life.
Well, except with Lilith.
She was just nuts.
Well, at least you take your time.
I don't date, I leap, headfirst.
Thank you.
More often than not, I get my heart broken.
By Maris.
By Daphne, even if she didn't know it.
At least Kit only broke my box spring.
All I can conclude is that I must have some deeper issues with women that manifest themselves in my behaviour.
- The trick is to pinpoint them.
- Well, you know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking of taking some time off and going into deep analysis.
That's not a bad idea, Niles.
You know, Steven Bachman is at the absolute pinnacle of psychodynamic research.
Perhaps we should see him.
If we went in together, we could get a rate.
- Shouldn't take more than a year.
- That's optimistic.
Jeez, how do you guys get up in the morning?
You wanna go into deep analysis?
Listen to me, I'm your father, there's nothing wrong with either one of you.
You dump a woman, but can't get her off your mind, so you get dumped by the other one.
And you should've stayed with the first one anyway, she was hotter.
And you, you're just learning how to date.
It would've been nice if it happened 25 years ago, but you play the cards you're dealt.
Me, I like Bonnie, Bonnie's dog humps Eddie, I don't like Bonnie anymore.
Doesn't mean I have issues with women, it's just life.
You know, good stuff happens and bad stuff happens, that's all.
You just gotta look on the bright side.
It's like that old song: You gotta accentuate the positive Maybe Dad's right.
We do tend to overanalyse things.
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?
Let's go over here.
Let's do a little singing.
- Dad, no.
- No, come on.
Hey, buddy, can you play "Accentuate the Positive"?
Oh, no, I'm just noodling around.
The real pianist doesn't come till 9.
Oh, well Well, you can fake it, can't you?
Well, no, not really.
I actually only know three songs.
"America the Beautiful," "Happy Birthday," and "Goldfinger".
- That's all right, buddy.
- No, no, no, come on, guys.
We were gonna sing a happy song, let's sing a happy song, come on.
Play "Goldfinger".
- We don't know the words to that.
- No.
You knew it when you were kids.
It'll cheer you up.
Come on.
- Hit it.
- All right.
Goldfinger.
Goldfinger He's the man, the man with the Midas touch.
He's the man The man with the Midas touch A spider's touch.
A spider's touch Such a cold finger.
- Dad, this is ridiculous.
- Come on, sing it.
Such a cold finger Beckons you to enter his web of sin That's it.
But don't go in
