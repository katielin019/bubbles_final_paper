{START OF EPISODE 1}
It's been a while since I left the family and moved back to Philly.
I miss them a lot, but I got me a great job at Duke's House of Cheesesteaks.
And, like they say, life goes on.
Hey, Smith.
Yo, man, what's up?
Come here.
What's up?
What does this contract say?
- "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
" - That's right, not Philadelphia, Bel-Air.
- Yeah, man, but, you know, my mama- - Get in the van.
Yo, homes, to Bel-Air.
Mr. Jazz is here to see you.
If you need me, I'll be hiding the silver.
Hey, Jazz, what's up, man?
- Psssh!
- Psssh.
My best friend's back from Philly, I gotta hear about it on the street?
I tried to get in touch.
Where are you staying?
On the street.
At least until Jewel lets me back in the house.
Hey, man, it's good to see you, man.
By the way, who's playing the mother this year?
It's the same mom.
Who are you?
Oh, come on, Jazz, that's Baby Nicky.
I'm going back on the street where things make sense.
I am leaving in five minutes whether you are ready or not.
Nicky, go get your brother, Carlton.
I got to give you props for investing in this record store.
That must've been a lot of money.
How much are we really worth?
We?
"We.
" Girls, Vivian, let's go!
Philip, I do not appreciate being rushed like this.
It's your opening, I want to look beautiful.
Well, Vivian, I don't have that kind of time.
Carlton, let's go.
Daddy, I'm so excited you bought a record store.
Finally an investment where I can hang out.
Nothing stopped you from hanging out at my hardware store.
Uncle Phil, I ain't playing.
I am in your will, right?
Well, if he is, I'll fight it.
I'm going, but I'm not staying long.
I'm conferencing with my producers about my talk-show persona.
Am I antagonizing like Geraldo?
Am I investigative like Donahue?
Maybe you should go bald like Montel.
Okay, now, are we missing anyone?
Just G, but we don't take him nowhere anyway.
Okay.
Come on, let's go.
Yo, Uncle Phil, man, this place is on book.
Hey, you know, this is the kind of place I could see myself managing.
Call me stupid, but I'm in this to make some money.
Hey, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I could see that.
From the time I walked in, I was having visions, man.
You know what?
You ain't got no X-rated skin flicks up in here.
You toss some of them up in here, you be making it hand over fist.
- Hand over fist.
- Will, Will, Will!
No offense but in the world of business and finance, I consider you the antiprofit.
Wait, Uncle Phil, I'm serious.
I feel this, you gotta let me in on this.
- No.
- Why not?
I mean, Mother, you watch my show, am I too soft-spoken?
Hilary - I got music in my blood.
- I don't doubt you have the potential but do you ever use it productively?
Never.
Do you ever apply yourself the way that you could?
No.
Son, when I was your age and I was working on that farm boy, I had to work from 9 in the night to 9 forever.
I just worked and ASHLEY : It's gonna make you move and groove Hey, DJ, keep playing that song All night On and on and on Mr. DJ DJ See, I don't know what to tell you.
Ever since you left Philly I have been trying to let you Hey, Mr. DJ Hey, Mr. DJ All the girls are ready Ching-ching!
ASHLEY : Tell me why You're playing with my mind, boy Take some time To open up your eyes - Hey, can you feel it, G?
- Oh, yeah.
I really don't understand Guess not.
I'm telling you, my boys in the studio were saying your vocals are all that.
Will, I can't believe it.
I sound so professional.
You'd be surprised what a little creativity in the studio can do.
Ask Janet Jackson.
All right, party in the house.
Which ain't necessarily a good thing.
- Oh, that's great.
Mm-hm.
- Wait a minute, Ashley, is that you?
- Uh-huh.
- It sounds good, doesn't it, Uncle Phil?
- Oh, I like what I'm hearing.
- Uh, uh.
- Oooh!
I'm telling you, this girl has a God-given talent.
- Oh, you ain't lying.
- Ohh!
Yeah, that's why I'm managing her professional singing career.
No daughter of mine is getting into the music business, period.
- I've seen it ruin too many young lives.
- But, Daddy- I don't want any buts.
Well, you're certainly losing that battle.
Ashley's only 15 years old.
Honey, you should be concentrating on your education, not on singing.
- Don't you understand?
Exactly.
- Case closed.
- But- Now, we better start our walk, Vivian.
Baskin-Robbins closes at 6.
I knew they'd say no.
Don't worry about it, everything is right on schedule.
Will, what are you talking about?
You heard what Daddy said.
Yeah, that's why everything is right on schedule.
We ask his permission, he says no, we do it anyway.
Hey, baby.
Girl, how are you doing?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
You know me, the pool party at Q's crib.
I'm sorry.
Q doesn't have a pool.
Oh, you know what?
I'm just gonna go ahead in.
I'm gonna surprise Gordy.
- You don't have to buzz him.
- Look, don't make me call the cops.
You feisty, huh?
- What, are you Creole?
- That's it.
Okay, all right, all right.
Relax.
I don't know why you fronting on me.
She knows me.
- Speaker for Mr. Berry.
- We didn't order any speakers.
It's a gift from Sony Music from Mr. Sock-It-To-Me.
Okay, well, then come right in.
Just put that over there.
You know, there's a $20 delivery charge.
Oh, my mistake.
Hey, listen, I am the one that is responsible for getting Ashford and Simpson back together.
I deserve a damn Image Award.
Quincy?
Oh, come on, man, he gets one every year.
The cheapskate, he won't even buy a pool.
Oh, yeah?
Well, listen, before I have to start throwing my weight around and come down there and get somebody fired, I want my Image Award.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you understand me?
I want my Image Award now.
That's what I said and that's what I meant.
That's exactly how I feel about it.
Indeed.
I don't wanna hear about that, man.
Listen, that is not my problem.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, I tell you what, you just do that then.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, goodbye.
Hey!
You know me.
I'm calling security.
Hey, Mr. Berry, please listen.
I just need five minutes.
Please give me five minutes.
Remember when you were managing the Chi-Lites?
You broke in to Dick Clark's office.
You wouldn't leave until he put them on American Bandstand?
You read my book.
I'm telling you, I read everything that got anything to do with music.
Hey, did you know James Brown got an orthopedic cape?
All right, all right, let's listen to it.
You're gonna love this.
This is the straight butter, you will love it.
All right, well, let's check it out.
- Oh, look at you, look at you.
- Not bad.
ASHLEY : Tell me why- Pass.
- Pass?
What are you talking about?
- Look here, son.
It was a nice try, but I'm a very busy man.
So if you'll excuse me.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
All right.
I see how you're trying to play me.
But you know what?
You better get a good look at this face and remember it because when Ashley Banks' album goes double platinum you're gonna be seeing it in your dreams and in your nightmares because you ain't the only game in town.
Chht.
Oh, and p. s the Jheri curl played out with the jerk.
Let's keep it flowing on New Artist Spotlight.
Here's a funky-five, free-flux dance mix of "Mandy" by Funky Bunch.
- Hey, Johnny C. - Hey.
How are you doing?
Think you can help a young janitor out?
Oh, sure, lay it on me, my brother.
Bla-bla-blam-blam!
Here it is, the next Whitney.
- Where's the rest?
- Huh?
This is the music business.
You need the universal lubricant.
I'm talking cash, man.
Oh.
Whoo.
Hey, man, you know what?
Don't even worry about it, you probably can't help me anyway.
Seeing as this is your last day and all.
Whoa, whoa, what's that mean?
Brother, I was just cleaning the executive suite up on the 24th floor.
- Mm.
- They're talking about getting rid of you.
Yeah, say you're slipping.
They can't do this to me, I have a contract.
Let me tell you, it is so far beyond business up there, they're getting personal.
One of them said your mom have a limp.
She up on this tip, like: We'll see about this.
Oh, and you should probably take the stairs, man.
- You know, the elevator's out.
- Thanks.
All right, that's the short version of "Mandy" because it's time to bump and grind to another Johnny C. Find.
L.A., show some love to Ashley Banks' "Make Up Your Mind.
"  Johnny C. Here with all the happening new artists right here on 93.4, The Groove.
Whoa, looks like we got some requests.
Who's this?
How are you doing?
This is Rafica calling from Watts.
Ho!
Could you play that record by Ashley Banks called "Make Up Your Mind"?
I'm with this man who can't make up his mind.
That's why I'm like, "You better make up your mind.
"  My name is Tony.
And I'd like to hear that record by Ashley Banks called "Make Up Your Mind" before I have to come down there and blow up your car.
And here we go for an unprecedented 11th time Ashley Banks singing "Make Up Your Mind.
"    Whoo.
Oh, Batman.
ASHLEY : Tell me why you're playing with my mind  Johnny C.  Gordy Berry?
I mean, hey.
Hey, Gordy, what's up, man?
The Banks girl?
Yeah, yeah.
She's new.
Club dates?
Well, her manager, Will Smith, says she's gonna be performing this Friday night at the Peacock Club.
Right, yes, yes, that's on the ULA campus.
Sure, I'll see you there.
All right, peace.
Yes.
I'm in.
Whoo!
There's nobody up there.
Made you look.
Gordy.
Ashley.
That is Gordy Berry.
That is the biggest record producer in the world.
Look, we got a packed house out there.
Your entire career rests on this moment.
There will never be another chance like this.
Your future, my future everything is riding on this performance.
One more thing, relax.
And now I'd like to introduce you to a performer who is a real feather in our peacock cap.
Get it?
Feather, peacock.
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, here's Ashley Banks.
Damn, she must have stage fright.
Carlton, help me.
Sorry, folks, wawhhh, a little technical difficulty.
Ashley, you all right, babe?
Hey, this is easy.
You've done this before.
Before it was for fun.
Hey, this is for fun.
Look at all these fun faces, fun people.
Come on, baby, you're all right.
Good.
I'll stay right here with you, okay?
I'm right here with you.
Carlton.
Tell me why You're playing with my mind, boy You either do or don't, you will or you won't Got to make you open up your eyes To see the things you do are foul And yes, it hurts I really don't understand I wanna know if you're the man Because if you're not the one I'll have to take a stand Although I'm crazy 'bout you I can live without you And you're wasting my time Boy, it's time I told you I can wait no longer Got to make up your mind Tell me, tell me I wanna know, I wanna know Boy, you're running out of time Got to make up your mind Tell me, tell me I gotta go, I gotta go, baby This is how I feel inside I won't waste your time or mine I really just don't understand After all I do for you Still you show no gratitude  Although I'm crazy 'bout you I can live without you - And you're wasting my time - Why you wanna waste my time?
Boy, it's time I told you I can wait no longer - Got to make up your mind - Got to make up your mind  Will, Will, get over here.
Geoffrey must have dimed us out.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.
Mr. Berry, listen, I just wanna apologize for my uncle, man.
He got a wooden plate, found out he got termites.
Hey, Will, Will, Will.
Listen, man.
I heard enough.
She's a knockout.
I definitely wanna sign her.
- You do?
- Absolutely.
I mean, I knew you would, man.
I told you you was going- Philip and Vivian Banks, Gordy Berry.
Hey, listen, your daughter is quite a find.
Listen, why don't we set something up in my office, say, Monday, 2:00.
Excuse me, Mr. Berry, but my daughter will not be in your office this Monday.
I am prepared to offer a $30,000 advance.
- You were wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.
I'm sorry you wasted your time, Mr. Berry.
Well, the offer is on the table.
Excuse me.
Wait, hold on a second there, Mr. Berry.
Uncle Phil, come on.
You didn't think I was good enough to run your record store.
But look what I did, man.
I made a demo tape.
I got it played on the radio.
I got the biggest producer in the world to come down here and see Ashley.
What else I gotta do?
We will discuss this at home, Will.
Daddy, you said yourself that I was good.
Mom.
It's a great opportunity.
I just don't want anything to happen to Ashley.
Come on, you ain't got to worry about that.
I'm gonna be managing her.
That ain't help nothing, did it?
- Daddy, please.
- Don't you give me that look.
Vivian, she's giving me that look.
All right, all right, all right.
If you can guarantee that this does not interfere with Ashley's normal life that means her grades remain high that she's home every night for dinner and in bed by 11:00 you got a deal.
Hey, Gordy, where my money?
Will, I'm going to be on you like a shadow.
Shadow?
Uncle Phil, with you, it'd be more like an eclipse, wouldn't it?
- Eclipse.
- Eclipse.
You know, just for that crack, I'm gonna make myself co-manager.
One fat joke too many.
I knew it, I could feel it.
Do we have a deal?
- We have a deal.
- Excellent.
- All right.
Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.
I'll see you soon.
Thank you.
Will, you better be sure you know what you're doing.
Uncle Phil, I know exactly what I'm doing.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Hey, Uncle Phil, man, I got to give you props for investing in this record store.
That must have been a lot of money.
How much are we really worth?
"We"?
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song All night On, and on, and on Hey, Mr. DJ, all the girls are ready Ching-ching!
Boy, it's time I told ya I can't wait no longer Got to make up your mind I heard enough.
She's a knockout.
I definitely wanna sign her.
Will, you better be sure you know what you're doing.
Uncle Phil, I know exactly what I'm doing.
Six is completely unacceptable.
It's Will Smith you talking to.
I want 10.
Oh, no, no, no.
You got to give me 10 or I'm taking Ashley Banks elsewhere.
That's what I thought.
You're a very smart man.
No, no, love you.
Ciao.
Negotiating for a bigger royalty?
No, a better table.
I got a business meeting tomorrow night at the Roxy.
Boy, this management thing is love.
Trust me.
People tripping all over themselves just to make you happy.
Hey, now I know how Hammer must have felt the week he was famous.
Look at you, Will.
These insincere, sycophants ply you with gifts shower you with money, and why?
Is it because you have any discernable talents?
No.
It's because you control someone else who does.
- You want a job, don't you?
- Yes.
Well, I ain't got no problem keeping it in the family.
You can handle the money, business manager.
Yes!
You're gonna be watching me, aren't you?
Like white folks watch Wings.
Hi, everyone.
Hey, Hil.
I got a great idea for your talk show.
Divas: Past, present and future.
On the same show you have Aretha, Whitney and Ashley.
Who's Ashley?
Your sister.
Well, Ashley hasn't even released a single yet.
I need guests who can deliver ratings.
I mean, if she wants to come sit in the audience or something, you know   Yes, Martha?
Mr. Berry and his associates are here.
Yes, send them in, please.
All right, let me do all the talking.
All you got to do is agree with everything I say and disagree with everything they say.
Why don't I just smile and nod?
Better.
- Ahh!
- Ha-ha-ha.
Gordy.
What's up?
You look fabu.
It's nice to see you, Will.
Carlton.
What that?
What that?
Brother, you got to show me love.
Hey!
Thanks.
Listen, you know my associates.
Yeah, Rob, Fab.
Blame it on the rain, brothers.
Will, Will, Will, this is quite an office you've got here.
You like it?
Actually, I'm not even finished yet.
I'm having a bust of my head made.
It's getting helicoptered in on Thursday.
Hey, suppose we get right down to business?
Yes, sir.
Hey, y'all fellas have a seat.
Watch them beads on my leather, bro.
- All right.
Now, Gordy  Yeah?
What is the best way to launch a new act?
- Well, I've always found  Ease up a second there, bro.
That was one of them there rhetorical questions, you know?
Ain't that right, Carlton?
All right.
We are gonna introduce Ashley to the world in person.
Announcing the Ashley Banks North American tour.
Right.
Okay.
Now, we gonna start right here in New York.
And then blang, over to Phoenix.
Then bap, bap, bap, bladow, over to Orlando.
Then blip-bloop, we gonna slide up to Seattle.
Next we Will, Will.
We would need a jet to meet that kind of schedule.
I mean, we simply don't have those kind of resources.
Y'all got a couple of weeks to come up with the funds.
I got dates in all these cities.
You've already booked the tour?
Oh, no, no, no, bro, I said "I got dates.
" See, I got Tina in New York.
I got Beth in Seattle.
Ohh.
Actually, I might need a couple days in Seattle.
Beth is a big girl, you know?
Oh, you laughing.
You must like them a little rotund yourself.
Will.
Will, now wouldn't it be more effective to shoot a video for Ashley?
Oh, come on, Gordy, video is dead, man.
Ain't that right, Carlton?
Absolutely.
Most of the arcades are losing money.
I mean Right.
Moving on.
Next, I got a publicity stunt planned for Ashley.
We gonna set up lunch with her and Tevin Campbell.
Midway through, she gonna stand up, take a drink and splash it in his face.
Right?
Then she slap him, call him a punk.
Just "punk.
" Just scream it out.
Next, we plant a story that Tevin been sleeping outside her crib with a rifle.
Now, it ain't gonna do too much for Tevin's career but Ashley becomes America's favorite victim.
Now, Will, Tevin is a great kid.
- Oh, no, no, no, this just business here.
- He's also my godson.
Then you can be there for him.
Why don't you sleep on it?
- Let that marinate a little bit, all right?
- Yeah, I'll do that.
Uh This meeting has been very interesting.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hey, this is just the first of many, man.
- Okay.
- Hey, Gordy.
- Yeah?
- I can feel it.
We are gonna make history.
History?
That's just the word I was thinking.
Goodbye, Will.
Bye.
That went great.
Whoa, whoa.
Carlton, slow down, man.
I was with Tisha last night.
I can't walk that fast.
Will, we're late.
Relax, Carlton.
Look here, I'm Ashley's manager.
You see all this?
I run all this.
They can't start none of this thing without me.
ASHLEY : Boy, you're running out of time Got to make up your mind CHORUS : Tell me, tell me I gotta go, I gotta go, baby This is how I feel inside I won't waste your time or mine - Who the hell are all these people?
- I don't know.
After all I do for you  Ashley, why don't you take a five.
We'll hit it hard in a bit.
Will, I'm so glad you came.
Of course I came, I'm your manager.
- Will, didn't you talk to Daddy?
About what?
- What's going on here?
- Ashley, I'll take care of this.
Why don't you go listen to some of the playback.
You're doing great.
- Who are you?
- Jerry DeCarlo.
Gordy thought you might need help from a more experienced manager.
But you're the man, Will.
You're the man.
I'm just the man behind the man.
Oh, uh-huh.
And what you doing back there?
Will, we'd like you to focus on one of our more established clients.
Oh, really?
Who?
Tito, Jermaine.
Your pick.
Look here, buddy.
I don't think you quite understand what's going on here.
I run all this, okay?
And Ashley is not having this at all, right?
So you need to get to going, all right?
Go ahead, take care.
Will, I wish you had come home last night.
I didn't mean for you to find out about it this way.
Oh, you knew about this, huh?
Jer, would you excuse us for a minute, please?
"Jer"?
Oh, no, no.
I'm calm.
- How could you sell me like this, man?
- Will.
You're making this more difficult than it has to be.
The decision has been made.
- Carlton, that's eavesdropping.
- So?
This is better than television.
I put this whole thing together.
I will not be thrown out on my Ashley, would you quit it?
Will, you are no longer in charge.
Oh, great.
Now we'll never know how Will took the news.
MAN : three weeks and the way you folks have been requesting it it'll be there forever.
Here's smoking Ashley Banks with "Make Up Your Mind.
"  smoking Ashley Banks.
ASHLEY : Tell me why you're playing with my  All this money for rent and I still got roaches.
Will, I want you to come home.
- Home?
Oh, I have no home.
- Oh, come on, the whole family misses you.
- Family?
Oh, I have no family.
- All right, you made your point.
Point?
I have no Very clever, Uncle Phil.
But then again, you are this big-time lawyer.
Will, this wasn't an easy thing for me to agree with.
We both know that you were in over your head.
I was just trying to do the best thing I could for Ashley.
You can push me out and take everything over but we both know I made Ashley Banks.
Well, gee, I could have sworn that Vivian and I had something to do with it.
You know what I'm talking about, Uncle Phil.
I got the deal, then I got the shaft.
I understand you're angry, but I'm asking you to come home.
- Home?
I have no home.
- All right.
You cannot live here forever.
I ain't planning on living here forever.
Just till I'm dead.
Smith, we gotta talk.
Look, not now, Mr. Weisman, I'm in the middle of a meeting.
No, you're not.
Your lease ran out last week.
I want you out of here by the end of today.
I got the worst luck with tenants.
Can I still come home?
Home?
I thought you had no home.
- Uncle Phil.
- Uncle?
What?
- I thought you had no uncle.
- Tell me where the car is.
I have no car.
Will.
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
You happy to see me?
- Yes.
It's so hard to smack you upside your head when you're not here.
I thought you said everybody wanted me back.
Come on, now, Vivian.
We can't blame Will for what's happened to Ashley.
Okay, wait, wait.
Time out.
What happened to Ashley?
This singing contract has gone straight to her head.
These new managers are putting pressure on her and she's doing the best she can with it.
They must be doing something right.
She is in heavy rotation on The Box, heh, heh whatever that is.
I'm glad you're okay with this because I don't like it.
Not one little bit.
Gee, she hides it so well.
Hey, yo, man, is Ashley really that bad?
I'm afraid so, Master William.
Perhaps later on we could pour some water on her and watch her melt.
Carlton, do you hear that?
You mean your song on the radio?
No, I mean the cash registers racking up my record sales.
Isn't she funny?
Don't just stand there, Ashley.
Call him a good boy and toss him a treat.
Will, don't be mad.
I'm thanking you on my album cover.
Oh, really?
So thanks.
What the hell is my problem?
There she is, America's sweetheart.
Watch the hair!
I have some very exciting news for you.
Make it quick.
Miss Banks has to mentally prepare for her appearance tomorrow at Dad's record store.
I have the greatest idea for my talk show.
It's a salute to divas.
Past, present and future.
Hilary, that is my idea.
Right, just like you launched Ashley's career?
So how about it, Ash?
Hilary, it sounds really wonderful and I'd love to do it but, well, my managers have this silly little idea about me only doing important shows.
Oh, so, what you doing, 60 Minutes?
So young, so bitter.
Carlton!
Oh, she is so self-centered.
I hear that.
After everything I've done for her.
You?
Who's talking about you?
Well, I'm talking about Miss Thing.
Somebody need to snatch her big helium head down out the stratosphere.
Excuse me, I need to talk to Queen Sheba.
Alone.
Will, I never wanted to fire you.
- Really?
- Of course not.
I would have been happy paying you a token salary while someone else did the real work.
I discovered you.
And don't think I'm not grateful but it's time for me to take my career to the next plateau.
And, face it, you're small potatoes.
Small potatoes?
I'll show you how small my potatoes are.
Carlton!
Sorry, no.
Next.
Sorry, too tall.
You're a little too big-boned.
Well, okay.
Okay.
Get a tan.
No.
No.
No.
Would you think?
Hey, Will, look what I found.
Jazz, she looks just like Ashley.
The resemblance, much like the beat, goes on.
Sing something, honey.
Although I'm crazy about ya I can live without ya And you wasted my time  Jazz, she's great.
I'm back!
You?
Get your own client.
This one's mine.
Come on, Bashley.
What are you doing here?
Doesn't Ashley got some boots that need licking?
Well, she found out I was skimming money off the top, so she fired me.
Her own brother.
Face it, man, family means nothing to Ashley no more.
Look what she did to me.
Well, at least you still have your 15 percent.
All I got was a promise she wouldn't press charges.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa.
What are you talking about?
I don't have no 15 percent.
Will, you had an oral agreement with Ashley.
That's legally binding.
Just ask Kim Basinger.
You're right, man, I didn't even think about that.
Thanks a lot, C. I think I'll slide down to this record store and give the good news to Little Miss Fat Head.
Where are all the people?
Philip, I don't know, but you've gotta do something.
She's been sitting there for hours.
Hey, kid, how'd you like to have your own personal CD of "Make Up Your Mind"?
Man, that song is weak.
Last week.
- I thought you said it was gonna be a hit.
- It was.
We had such positive feedback that we threw extra promotional muscle behind it saturated our key demo playlist and topped out.
- What does that mean?
- The kids got sick of her.
Hey, what's up, y'all?
How you doing?
Man, let's see, I guess I'll get one of these.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Nas in the house.
- Oh, Partners In Rhyme.
I love that CD.
- What are you doing?
Oh, I just want my piece of the pie.
Well, you know, seeing as how Ashley and I have a legally binding oral agreement which guarantees my 15 percent.
I guess you got me there.
So tell me something.
How much is 15 percent of nothing?
It's Okay, 15.
Hold up, 15, carry the zero.
Fifteen Nothing, you math whiz.
Fifteen percent of nothing is nothing.
All right, what are you talking about?
Well, evidently Ashley is not gonna be as big a star as they thought she was going to be.
- And I can't say that I'm not happy about it.
- Me either.
Well, it's nice to know my family was rooting for me to fail.
Ashley, that is not at all what we Ashley.
- This is all your fault, Will.
- This is all your fault, Will.
ASHLEY : Tell me why you're playing with my mind, boy Hey, Ashley.
Hey, you mind signing my CD?
Very funny.
No, come on.
I'm being serious.
One day you're gonna be famous in something and a signed CD is gonna be worth some real dough.
Or if not, we can use it to prop up an unlevel table.
You know, so it don't wobble.
- Is that a smile?
- No.
Yes.
Why are you being so nice to me?
I was such a jerk.
Well, you learned from the master.
Look, this whole thing had us all acting a little crazy.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we forget the apologies call it even.
Deal?
Deal.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
- Will?
- Hmm?
Are you crying too?
No, cold-and-flu season.
Oh, you guys.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Yo, Nicky, you ready?
Almost.
Hurry up, man, we got to get on.
Where's Nicky?
Today is children's day at the Nixon Library.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, man.
Nicky's going with me.
I'm taking him to the sorority beach-volleyball tournament.
Mm.
Two hundred honeys bumping and spiking.
You know what I mean?
Heh.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, you don't know what I mean.
You're just Nicky's cousin, I'm his brother.
- I'm a big branch of his family tree.
- Mm.
Then why are your limbs so short?
Let's see what my father thinks about this.
All right, all right, you big baby.
Fine, Nicky can go with you.
Y'all just have fun.
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, man.
Oh.
Don't forget your flag, though.
What's a day at the Nixon Library without Old Glory?
- Oh, good call.
- All right.
Hey!
Hey!
Everybody going to the beach say, "Kowabunga"!
- Kowabunga!
!
- Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, nice flowers.
Another stalker?
I wish.
I had a problem at the studio today.
What happened?
Well, I was late for my talk-show taping, so I parked in the first space I could find.
I found out later it was Leeza Gibbons' spot and she had my car towed.
I was so upset, I sent these flowers to cheer myself up.
Man, now who does a thing like that?
I know, can you believe her?
I don't care how high her ratings are, nobody treats Hilary Banks like this.
I'll get her.
And her little car too.
You're not taking them diet pills again, are you?
You have to help me think of a way to get even with her.
Forgive me, but why are you involving Master William?
Will's come a long way from Philly, but let's face it he's still a common street hood from the wrong side of the tracks.
So will you help me?
Oh, gee, you know, when you put it that way, no.
Will, I'm begging you.
Look, come on, girl, that's vandalism you're talking about.
No.
Oh, I do remember this one time, though my homies was trying to get even with this gym teacher.
My man Chill took a key, scratched all up the side of the paint.
I took a potato, right, rammed it up in the tailpipe.
Dude came out, started that joint, it was like "kaboom"!
Boom!
What a wonderful lesson for Master Nicky.
Perhaps now you could teach him to run with scissors.
Come on, G, Nicky knows that vandalism ain't cool, right?
- Right.
- All right, come on, let's go.
Unh.
Get down to this beach.
Get with these honeys, know what I mean?
Geoffrey, if I were a potato, where would I be?
- Where are you two going?
- To the beach.
Yeah, me and Will are going trolling for slimmies.
He be tripping.
Ha, ha.
Heh.
No, he mean, "We gonna play in the sand.
" Ha, ha.
Look, Ashley, it's Daddy's mad face.
Come on, Nicky, let's go upstairs before Daddy's head explodes.
Will, at this age, Nicky is like a sponge.
If he hears something he likes, he's gonna imitate it.
Oh, kind of like Michael Bolton.
Maybe you've been spending too much time with Nicky.
Doesn't Carlton have some plans for this afternoon?
Oh, yeah, and where is he?
I know he better have a daggone good excuse for standing Nicky up.
Will locked me in the closet.
That's so tired.
All right, Uncle Phil I just wanted to take the kid to his first bikini volleyball tournament.
I do not want my little boy exposed to that much sex.
Oh, don't worry, Mom, it only happened once.
You meant Nicky, didn't you?
I read that Dougie is gonna be appearing down at the mall today.
Oh.
Dougie?
That big, dumb, orange whale that be singing them stupid songs?
Those are life-affirming little ditties that bring joy to the young and young at heart.
I love everything, big and small - Cute and ugly, I love them all - Cute and ugly, I love them all Would you like to go see Dougie at the mall today?
Dougie?
Cool!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come on, time out.
Now, can we think about this for a second, please?
Now, Dougie loves everything.
People, am I the only one that finds something terribly wrong with that?
I love bugs and I love death I love oozing flesh wounds Mommy!
Mommy!
Will!
Will!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
I didn't know he was gonna act like that.
Look, at least can I take him to the mall?
Are we gonna go see Dougie?
Yeah, that's right.
Me and you.
Oh.
If we hurry out of there, we can make it to the victory swim.
Hey, unhand me.
Sir, the floor seating is for children only.
Now sit in the chair like a grown-up.
Where's Dougie?
Well, he is a whale.
Maybe we should go look for him at the beach.
- Okay.
- Yes.
It's Dougie.
I love you, everybody.
We love you, Dougie.
Let's all do the welcome song.
Everyone sing and dance along.
It's nice to be here With you, my friends My lovely, friendly, friendly friends I love you all so much, my friends I like my big friends   Hey, someone check the damn level.
It's nice to be here With you, my friends My little friends, my happy friends It's nice to be here with you, my friends My cutie, little friend   That's it.
You SOBs better pull your thumbs out and get your freaking acts together.
What's wrong with Dougie?
I think something must have crawled up his blowhole.
Dougie!
Dougie!
Dougie!
Dougie!
Dougie!
Let's get out of here.
Last time a Dougie concert was canceled, kids went crazy and trashed a babyGap.
Shut up, Carlton.
I'm gonna go back and have a mammal-to-mammal with Dougie.
Go get Nicky and calm this crowd down.
Come on, Nicky.
Sit right here.
Maestro.
Excuse me.
Mr. Dougie?
I was wondering when you were coming back out there because we've been waiting all day.
Aren't you a little old for this crap?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, but my cousin isn't.
You know, he came here to see a show.
Yeah?
What'd he pay for the ticket?
Nothing.
It was free.
Then the little brat got his money's worth.
Now beat it.
Um, look here, you big orange Moby Dick.
Listen, hotshot.
I know this isn't as glamorous as your job down at the mini-mart but I make an honest day's work.
And who the hell are you to look down on me, huh, punk?
You pushed me, called me "punk.
" That's funny.
Listen.
Um I'll tell you what, why don't you just put your hat on go back out there, do what you gotta do for the kids because they're looking forward to it.
Tough guy, huh?
I'm so scared.
You better keep your fins off me, all right?
Why, what are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do, wise guy, huh?
- I think you better keep your fins off me.
- Oh, yeah?
Oh, it's on now.
Okay, time for another song.
Aww.
What are you doing to Dougie?
Oh.
We was just playing, y'all.
Hey, sorry.
I need a drink.
You hurt Dougie.
I hate you, Will.
Nicky.
You see?
- Get him!
- No.
Mom, presenting the all new and improved Nicholas Banks.
Look at you.
Nicky and I are gonna be spending more time together, especially since he's M-A-D at W-I-L-L.
How do you like your new clothes, baby?
Mommy, I H-A-T-E them.
From now on, it's you and me, Nicky.
The fabulous Banks boys.
Great.
Hey, what's up, everybody?
Nicky.
He's still mad at you, and so am I. Oh, please leave me alone, Carlton.
I already had to go through this for 40 hours with Uncle Phil.
I made a mistake.
That's why I bought this train set.
Well, it's a start.
Thanks.
When I was a little girl, I got so mad at your mother I stopped speaking to her for weeks.
Heh.
Really?
It's hard to imagine you being quiet for that long, Aunt Viv.
Go on.
She gave away one of my favorite toys.
It was a Raggedy Ann doll.
But I got over it.
Whoa, wait a minute, my mom told me about that.
Didn't you chop the head off her teddy bear and flush it down the toilet?
That's how I got over it.
Look at this.
"Powerful Earthquake Rattles Northern Coast.
" Oh, boo-hoo.
This.
"Television personality Leeza Gibbons was shocked that the woman attempting to vandalize her car was none other than rival talk-show host Hilary Banks.
Banks, seen here wielding a potato " Wielding?
I was not wielding, I was rubbing.
I rubbed that damn potato all over Leeza's car and it didn't make a scratch.
At least they didn't catch me putting my keys in her exhaust pipe.
Hilary, you were suppo Never mind.
Hey, Nicky.
What's all this?
His Dougie toys, he's giving them all away.
I'm not worthy, thanks to you.
Nicky, Nicky, come here, come here.
Listen.
You don't understand, man.
Listen, I wasn't rumbling with Dougie.
I was rumbling with the guy inside Dougie.
Oh, right, the guy inside Dougie.
That damn whale got him brainwashed.
Will, Nicky believes in Dougie the same way he believes in Santa Claus.
- So?
- Well, Dougie's his hero.
Didn't you have heroes when you were a kid?
Yeah, Shaft.
And how did you feel when you found out that Shaft wasn't real?
What are you talking about?
No, I'm saying, he was based on an actual guy.
No, he wasn't.
He was too, Ashley.
Shaft is fictional, Will.
I'm saying, he went to Africa and everything.
Will, you can't tell Nicky that Dougie isn't real.
Why don't you take him down to the mall and let him see you apologize to Dougie?
I thought of that, just he ain't there no more.
Well, where is he?
In rehab.
Well, Will, you have to do something.
It's like he lost his best friend.
Yep, I know the feeling.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey!
Geoffrey!
Yes, Miss Hilary?
I have been calling you for 15 minutes.
Didn't you hear me?
Yes, but I so rarely have a woman scream my name I was rather enjoying it.
I need to tape Leeza Gibbons' show.
I'm gonna record every nasty thing she says and then I'm gonna sue her for definition of character.
Now, how do you turn this on?
Why don't you just use the VCR?
Geoffrey, if I knew how to use the VCR, would I need this camera?
No, I would not.
Oh, it's already started.
Turn it on.
So that's all coming up today.
But we'll get to that in a moment.
First, I wanna talk about this so-called feud going on between Hilary Banks and me.
Now, Hilary, you and I, we're part of a very special sorority.
A sort of sisterhood of talk-show hosts.
I love your show and I wish you lots of success.
So, what do you say?
Let's bury the hatchet.
Ooh, that witch.
So you see it too.
All I see is a beautiful woman perched atop two of the most finely sculpted legs I've ever seen.
Oh, like those are real.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the pogmeister's in the house.
Who wants some?
Looks like I'm out.
Here's Will.
Maybe he can give you some competition.
I'm not in the mood.
Gets that from his mother.
You know what that kid's problem is?
His values is all messed up, man.
Any other normal kid, you could just buy their love back.
This has really upset you, hasn't it?
You was right, man, I'm a terrible role model.
I ain't never having no kids.
Well, now, Will, as much as the idea of your reproducing scares the hell out of me you'll make a great father.
Everybody makes mistakes with kids.
The important thing is to admit when you're wrong and to apologize.
How come you don't ever do that?
Don't question me.
Hey, Nicky.
Mind if I join you?
Wow.
I didn't know you could read the paper.
I can't.
Nicky, listen, there's something I need to tell you about Dougie.
And not just him neither.
It's the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy.
What about them?
Well, you're getting to be a big boy now.
Sooner or later you're gonna find out none of them - None of them are what?
- Um Here, read the personals, Nicky.
Yo, hottie.
Yo.
What's up, baby?
Freeze, munchkins!
They're not munchkins, son, they're elves.
Oh, yeah?
Who are you, Keebler?
Oh, boy, you're not even close.
All right, look here, dude.
Check it out.
Um I'm about to give a little ring-a-ding-ding to Bel-Air Security.
So if you and any of your little friends took anything, you better put it back.
You hold on there, young man.
Nobody talks to Santa Claus like that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Santa Claus.
Right on, yeah.
Everybody knows Santa Claus is a Clippers fan.
I am not.
I just can't move these things.
Now, you listen to me, sonny.
I don't usually make off-season visits but you were about to do something terrible to your cousin Nicky.
You don't have any idea what I'm talking about, do you?
- No.
- No, of course you don't.
Maybe this year I'll put a brain in your stocking.
Why do these make-believe guys keep pushing me?
Come on over here.
Sit down, right here.
Unh-unh.
Now, what are you talking about with Nicky?
Will being a child today is tougher than any time that I can remember.
But, Nicky Nicky is blessed with a very precious gift.
Innocence.
And you were about to take that away from him.
I didn't wanna do that.
I don't want him to be mad at me forever.
Aw, Will, nothing is forever with children.
They grow up and they forget.
Hey, remember something you used to believe in me once.
Maybe you ought to try believing in me again.
Oh, here, here.
You be a good boy.
And tell Carlton to stop faxing me.
I cannot get him into Princeton.
Will!
Will!
Nicky.
Nicky.
Hey.
Santa was here.
Did you see him?
Uh, yeah, we was kicking it in the pool house.
You know Santa?
Know him?
Who do you think gave him the idea for that mistletoe thing?
- You?
- Oh, yeah.
See, we was chilling back in Philly one night.
It was me, Santa, the tooth fairy and Shaft, right?
Who's Shaft?
Who's Shaft?
Oh, Nicky, there's so much I got to teach you.
See, Shaft was a complicated man.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, girl.
Whoo.
Hey, Carlton, what's up, man?
These are the books I need.
Will, classes have been in session for five weeks .
and you're buying books now?
Yeah, I thought I'd get an early start this year.
Look, check it out, I need English Lit 101, Sociology 101 and Human Sexuality 420.
Four-twenty?
That's a graduate course.
Oh, yeah, I did advance placement in high school.
You know what I mean?
Mm.
Valerie "The girl of my dream" Johnson, is in the house.
See, we got this little game that we play.
You know, I ask her out and she says no, you know.
Right now, she's winning 64-zip, but I feel lucky.
Excuse me.
Hey, Val, what's up, baby?
Let me tell you, this is your lucky day.
Oh, why?
Let me guess, you're not gonna ask me out today.
You are funny, girl.
No, but listen.
On the serious tip, I checked my schedule and, um, I'm free.
- So I can take you out tonight.
- Ha, ha.
Check again because I can't.
I already made plans.
My cousin is coming in from out of town and I promised her we'd hang out.
Oh, okay.
Hey, you're fired.
I got an idea.
How about we double date?
A double date?
Heh.
No, see, I can't.
My cousin has bad luck with men.
Wait a minute, baby, you're not listening.
I'm telling you, I got the perfect guy.
A perfect gentleman.
Listen, y'all come over the crib, you know, and we watch a little movie.
- We just chill.
- What's the difference?
If you don't go out with me, you're gonna go out with her or her or her.
Wait, Val, Val, I'm hurt, you know.
Now, come on, I mean, a guy can lie with his lips but he can't lie with his eyes.
- Will, I will go out with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
But it's not because of those fool eyes you just gave me.
Because I got no place else to go.
Baby, you know what, I knew you was gonna come around.
Why don't y'all roll past the crib you know, around 8:00?
Give me time to pad the headboard.
I'm kidding.
You're sensitive, baby.
I'll see you tonight, all right?
Yeah, I must really be desperate.
Ha, ha.
I can't wait either, baby.
Mm.
Oh, hey, Carlton, you up for a blind date?
Will, everyone knows that blind dates are usually dogs.
Oh, please.
I seen you out with plenty of women who looked like they had a little chihuahua in them.
If you're referring to Conchita, I don't see her anymore.
You missed a spot.
- Thank you, Miss Hilary.
- Ha, ha.
You know, this housework stuff's kind of fun.
Heh.
There's another one.
What's so important, you had to page me during a high-speed chase?
Jazz, I need you to come on a double date with me.
Since I married Jewel, I'm a changed man.
Unless the double date's with Hilary.
Hey, brown sugar.
- I gotta go.
- Wait, Jazz.
Hey, Carlton, about that double date, man So you couldn't find anybody else?
I guess I'm your only friend.
How pathetic.
You know what?
Never mind.
Okay, okay, stop groveling, Will, I'll do it.
I'm gonna go get the car.
Why don't you look over that manual one more time, huh?
- Okay.
- What's going on?
Oh, I'm so excited.
I just got my permit so I'm gonna go driving with Daddy.
Heh.
Ashley, stop.
U-turn, go back.
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.
Come on, Will, he can't be that bad.
Ashley, Daddy's fine when he's driving.
When he's in the passenger seat, he turns ugly.
"You're going fast.
You're going slow.
"  "Take a left.
Take a right.
"  "I don't care how pretty she is, you can't drive on the sidewalk.
"  Look, Ashley, get out while you can.
Whoop, too late.
Are you all set, sweetheart?
Uh, Daddy, I don't know about this driving thing.
Oh, darling, it's natural to be nervous the first time.
So if you don't feel you're ready, I'll understand.
See you.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
It had nothing to do with me.
- I wasn't around.
I think she's drinking.
Would you like to ride In my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to ride In my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars togeth  What the hell are you doing?
I'm just setting the mood for our date.
No, I don't think you understand.
See, this is my date.
You're just here running interference while I get my mack on.
All right, now, that's them.
You stand over there and try to look cool.
Excuse me, Superboy?
Scratch the cool.
You just chill a little bit.
All right?
Mm.
God bless America.
Will, this is my cousin, Karen.
Which one of these losers is my date?
That would be me.
Uh, this is my cousin, Carlton.
Where's the rest of him?
I may be short, but you know what they say about short men and tall women, don't you?
No, what?
I don't know, just making conversation.
- Well, this is a cool place you have here.
- Yeah.
Uh, hey, you haven't seen the best part.
Uh, wait until you see the hot tub.
Will.
Oh, no.
Girl, you just dirty.
No, it's strictly for therapeutic purposes.
I got this crick in my neck right here that's been really killing me.
Let me help you out with that, cuz.
We do this all the time.
Carlton, get off me.
Get off.
Get off me!
Ow!
Hey, hey, who's up for a video?
A video?
Hmf.
Hey.
No, this is 91/2 Weeks.
That is a sex movie.
Really?
I thought it was a documentary about Vanilla Ice's career.
Hey, why don't we check out my video collection?
BOY : Pa, I think Old Yeller's sick.
CARLTON &  Oh.
Are you crying?
Um No, I think I've got something in my eye.
It's okay, Carlton, this movie always gets to me too.
Don't be afraid to show your feelings.
Well, you know, sometimes I be at the crib alone and I just be crying for nothing.
What a punk.
Is that a cigarette?
That is a cigarette.
You know, in case you haven't heard tar and nicotine are damaging to your lungs.
It isn't just a rumor, it will give you a tumor.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go outside and fire up a butt.
Wow, that sounds like fun.
Huh?
Huh?
Is that crick in your neck bothering you again?
Let me get that.
No, no, no.
All right.
I think he wants you to leave.
I don't want her to leave.
I want you to leave, Carlton.
Will, I'm trying to watch the movie.
If you're not interested, why don't you go for a walk or something?
Fine.
Oh.
And they shoot the damn dog.
Oh.
I cannot believe you and Will are related.
You're so different.
- Like you and your cousin.
- Yeah, thanks for putting up with her.
- You know, most men find Karen kind of - Scary.
Sort of.
But you were a total gentleman, Carlton, and that's really hard to find these days.
What was that for?
Well, that was for Karen.
And this, this is for me.
Hello.
No, this ain't Carlton, this is Will.
Oh, Valerie.
Yeah, yeah, you know what?
I got some choice words for you too, girl.
How you gonna j?
Hello?
Aahh!
Man, I could kill that Carlton.
Master William if you're serious, I could make a call.
I was just kidding, G. Me too.
Hey, Will, wanna play catch?
Uh, I'm sorry, Nicky.
Not now, man.
I'm not in the mood.
Carlton won't play with me, either.
What's going on?
Well, we're kind of having problems.
Maybe you should talk to somebody.
You're right.
Look, Nicky, it's like this, man.
We always make Not me.
I'm just a kid.
Why don't you tell him?
Will, are you going to finally let me explain what happened?
Ah, shh.
Don't talk to me.
Will, for once in your life, be reasonable.
Can't we just discuss this like grownups?
Yeah, call me when you grow.
Okay, Ashley.
You ready?
- What are you doing?
- Driving lessons.
Lesson number one: Use a car.
Hilary, Nicky's right.
Can we just get in the car?
I don't think you're ready to get behind the wheel yet.
Now, put the car in gear and pull cautiously away from the curb.
Ashley.
What?
You're in neutral.
Okay, we're driving down Sunset.
Ooh, cute boy, 3 o'clock.
Ha, ha.
Keep your eyes on the road.
- Hilary.
- Now, take a left on Rodeo.
Remember to signal.
Oh, look, there's Bruce and Demi.
Hi.
Yuck, what is she wearing?
Hilary, this is beyond stupid.
Use your imagination.
You're doing great.
We're driving.
We're driving.
- Stop.
- What?
Cartier's having a sale.
Pick me up in an hour.
- Where are you going?
- To get a bus schedule.
Can't we just talk about this?
Listen, I don't wanna talk about nothing.
I just wanna watch the game and forget it.
Fine with me.
Careful with that drumstick, Uncle Phil.
Turn your back, Carlton's liable to start eating and say: "Oops.
Dad, it just jumped in my mouth.
" That wouldn't happen if you treated the drumstick like a person instead of a piece of meat.
You know what, Carlton?
You ain't nothing but a dog.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're an acrimonious, rancorous, virulent coveter.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you ain't nothing but a dog.
All right, all right.
That's enough.
Look, why don't I tell you guys a story?
Now look what you done.
I like Dad's stories.
And some day, I'm gonna tell my kids these same pointless anecdotes.
Go ahead, Dad.
All right.
Well, when I was growing up, my best friend lived in the next apartment.
His name was Ralph.
And one day, after 18 years of friendship, we had a fight.
Well, I went to college and he joined the Navy.
Five years ago I went to our high school reunion.
I was determined to bury the hatchet.
But Ralph didn't show up.
I found out that he died the month before.
Well, I never had a chance to make peace with him.
What's even worse, I can't even remember what we fought about.
You kids should think about that.
Hold up a second there, Aesop.
What's this apartment stuff?
Thought you grew up on a farm.
Well, in the South, "farm" and "apartment" are interchangeable.
Uh Uh, uh, five years ago?
Since when do they have reunions for your 22nd year?
- Yeah, man.
And how all of a sudden?
- Okay, okay, I made it up.
All right?
Pfft.
Huh.
I guess lying just run all through this family, huh?
I'm not lying, you nefarious, degenerate miscreant.
Oh, like I'm supposed to believe that, you big dog.
Did you put super glue in my hair gel?
Hey, that's what you get for stealing my girl.
I didn't have to steal her.
She was bored with you so she came to me, a real man.
So, what you saying?
I'm not a real man?
Yeah, you got it.
You should know that all that "yo, yo, hey, baby, bap, bap, bap" stuff is just played out.
It worked in high school, but now it's just embarrassing.
So I'm the embarrassment now?
Take it easy, stumpy.
You know something else?
I'm tired of all those short jokes.
I'm average height.
For a woman.
I'm large enough for Valerie.
You wants to go there, huh?
You know what?
I'm sick of this.
Let's go.
Let's go right now.
I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of this.
Come on, come on.
Let's go, come on, what, what, what you want to do?
Pfft.
Like that hurt.
Will.
Will, are you okay?
Will, wake up.
Will, come on.
Damn, still alive.
You know what keeps me going?
The thought of dancing on your grave.
Dance on my grave, will you?
Damn.
Come, Mr. Smith.
It's time for your sponge bath.
Oh, hey, good thing too, because I'm feeling dirty.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Tootsie roll.
Oh.
Oh, my leg.
My leg.
Aw.
Come on, girl, you gonna fall for that?
What about my sponge bath?
I'll let you shave me.
Ha-ha-ha.
Let me take care of Mr. Banks first.
Oh.
I get it.
First you steal my girl and now you're gonna steal my nurse.
You old prune.
I ought to knock your teeth out.
Go ahead, they're in the glass next to my bed.
Is that what you want?
Aw.
Got to go back to the ghetto on you now.
You're trying to kill me.
Will.
You all right?
- Come closer.
- You all right?
I'm feeling the life being sucked out of me.
Before I die I just want you to know that I I hate you.
Ha-ha-ha.
Carlton, wake up.
Carlton.
I never got to tell you I'm sorry.
Why, Carlton?
Will, hold you head back.
It'll stop the bleeding.
Thank you, Carlton.
I think you've helped enough.
I guess you're wondering what happened.
What's to wonder?
Ha, ha.
I have a nephew with a possibly broken nose.
And I don't wanna even know why your damn hands are stuck to your head.
What I do know is that I want both of you to settle this thing or I will.
You got it, Dad.
No problem.
You got it.
- We can handle it.
It's done.
We can handle it.
Just go on.
Look, Carlton, um I was doing a lot of thinking while I was unconscious.
We're cousins, man.
We've been together long enough.
I should know you would never do to me the kind of things that I would do to you.
That's sweet, Will.
I'm sorry for saying all those things and for punching your lights out.
It was a lucky shot.
I hit you pretty square, Will.
Look, the important thing is that we get beyond that lucky punch.
We're family, man.
We shouldn't be fighting like this.
We should be helping each other.
Hey, put her there.
Will.
You're right, man.
I'm sorry about the hair.
Let me help you.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Jazz, I got 10 bucks that says you bluffing worse than Haiti.
Let's see you beat three kings.
- Two pair.
- Yes.
A pair of red fives and a pair of black fives.
That is eight pots in a row.
Couldn't nobody be that lucky unless they were cheating.
It ain't cheating, Will.
It's focus.
The fact is the only time I ever concentrate is when I'm playing poker.
It's a gift.
According to my calculations, over the last three years..
Jazz has beaten us for approximately $13,000.
Would've been 14 if you hadn't gone back to Philly.
My wallet sure missed you, homey.
Well, I wasn't in Philly the whole time, Jazz.
No?
Where were you, Kalamazoo?
Alabama.
And what were you doing in Alabama?
I witnessed a murder.
You ain't witnessed no murder.
Did he, Carlton?
I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
And you shouldn't either.
Oh, shut up, Carlton.
Ain't nothing that me and Will don't know about each other.
Except this.
For real?
Tell me.
He can't.
Agent Moore swore us to secrecy.
Look, Carlton is right, Jazz.
Sorry I brought it up.
Let's just play.
Will, if you don't tell me what went down, our friendship is over.
It all started on a hot August day back in Philly.
Okay, you want to ante up?
I had just arrived at Duke's with my girl, Laqueesha.
The City of Brotherly Love's finest sister.
Oh, baby, thank you so much for walking me to work.
And thank you for breakfast too.
Oh, well, am I a better cook than your mama?
You all got different styles.
My mom usually like to cook with her clothes on.
I guess when she comes home from her trip I'm gonna have to go back to my own place, huh?
Well, either that or we have to be very, very quiet.
See, my moms won the WDAS-FM Back To Africa Contest.
She spotted anything culturally wrong in The Lion King.
Mmm.
I will see you later.
Little did she know that's the last time she'd see me.
Your woman was murdered?
Can I finish?
My fault, go ahead.
All of a sudden this big dude comes out of the kitchen.
- Hey, man, what was you doing in there?
- I'm with the Health Department.
- Hey, you - Do you have any?
Oh, man, Duke, Duke.
Duke.
I feared the worse when I got to Duke's office.
And I was right.
Oh, Mama, no.
I'd never seen a dead body before.
Of course, Curtis sees them all the time.
He works at the post office.
Turns out the mob was trying to muscle in on the lucrative Philly-cheese-steak market.
Duke told them, "Over my dead body.
" I sure do miss him.
Man, it was up to me to finger Duke's killer.
That's him.
That's him.
Number three, that's him.
You're positive it isn't one of the others?
No, that's him.
That's him, man.
Send the first two out.
The man we are looking at is John "Fingers" O'Neill the number one hit man for the mob.
I'm going to start on the paperwork.
Um   Boy, your choking days is over.
You're going to jail, fool.
Lucky there's 5 inches of glass between us.
Boy, I might just tear off into    All I could think was Turn around!
- He saw you.
- You think?
O'Neill escaped by bowling over nine agents and a DEA dog.
My life was in danger so they put me in witness protection in Deliverance, Alabama.
They hooked me up with a new life and a new name.
Floyd Palmer?
Hey, look, no.
Uh-uh.
Come on.
I'm more like a Malcolm Akbar Mustafa.
It's taken.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Come on.
I'm a city boy.
You know, I got to get out to: I gotta get out to the club and get my little groove on.
Talk some jazz.
Got me?
Well, the nearest town is Hatred, Mississippi.
I can check if there's dancing.
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I at least call my family in Bel-Air?
Absolutely not.
They've been informed you're in the program.
They wish you luck.
I was scared and somewhat alone.
So I did what I always do when faced with adversity.
Of course I love you, Laqueesha.
I don't think your butt is too saggy.
Please, O'Neill, no.
Oh, please don't kill me.
- I bet it was the killer, right?
- Are you in or out?
I'm out, I'm out.
Tough break.
Your full house would have beaten my seven high.
I bet it was the killer, right?
Look, Jazz, I just don't feel comfortable telling you any more, man.
Who knows?
Your life could be in danger.
What life?
I'm a married man.
By the way, if Jewel asks, we were at our pottery class tonight.
So I bet it was the killer, right?
All right, all right, I'll tell you, but ante up first.
Man, it was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen.
Uncle Phil.
Hey, man, what you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
Well, son, I'll tell you what I'm doing here.
You see, years ago I fell in love with and married a wonderful woman named Vivian.
Vivian had a sister named Vy.
Vy gave birth to a child named Will whose sole purpose in life has been to make mine a living hell.
Now, you've done a lot to me over the last four years but how you managed to have me ripped out of my wonderful life in Bel-Air and relocated to this landfill boggles my mind.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Is that a toupee?
Yes, it's a toupee.
It's a part of my new identity.
You see what you do to me?
Where's the bathroom?
It's right through that door.
It leads outside.
Oh, yeah, I know.
You better take this broomstick.
There's something living in there.
Hey, my family.
Aunt Viv.
What happened?
The FBI heard that your hit man was gonna try to get to you through us.
So they put us in the witness protection program too.
See, Mom, I always said Will would be the ruin of this family but did you listen to me?
Does anyone ever listen to me?
- What are you babbling about, Carlton?
- Carlton?
There's no Carlton here.
Thanks to you, Carlton Banks no longer exists.
He's now Little Zeke from Cabin Creek.
I hate to say it, Carlton, but you and your family are spoiled.
Sure, there was a homicidal maniac looking for you all but you still got a free vacation on the government's tip.
Royal flush.
Mm.
You win again.
Something must be affecting my concentration.
Go on, Will.
Yeah, go on, Will.
Jacks are better?
I knew if I could get Uncle Phil on my side, the others would come around.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Big Zeke to you.
Uncle Phil, how you gonna be mad at me?
You always telling me to do the right thing.
So?
You never listened to me before, why did you have to do it now?
What was I supposed to do?
Just let Duke's killer get away?
I know.
I know you did what you had to do.
Man, I just hope the FBI catches him before he gets to me.
You scared, son?
Not so much now that you're here.
Hey, man, look, want to try fishing tomorrow?
Oh, can't.
Tomorrow I start my new job at the manure plant.
Sleep tight, Floyd.
Good night, Big Zeke.
I hear you'd like to go dancing.
You know, there's one thing I can't follow.
- One thing?
- Yeah.
While you all were in Deliverance, where was the hit man?
- That's a good question, Jazz.
Thank you.
- Dude, why don't you tell him, Carlton?
- Well, I would, but I need a fresh deck.
Um The hit man was here in Bel-Air.
"Dear Neiman or Marcus, whichever of you gets this first.
I'm being held hostage by my own government.
Please send my fall/winter catalog care of Betty Mae Swilly, Deliverance, Alabama.
"  Yep?
Jewel.
Yeah, the pottery class.
No, no, no, we was at the pottery class.
But, uh, the kiln blew up.
No, Jazz, he He busy picking vase particles out of his butt.
Ow!
Ow!
Jewel, listen  I know that sound.
I better get home.
Wait a minute, you'll miss the best part of the story, where we meet the bear.
- The bear?
- The bear?
Oh, pfft, the bear.
Yeah.
Deuces are wild.
Uh You're the animal lover, Carlton, why don't you tell him about the bear.
Sure.
See, in order to find food we had to hike into the nearest town.
I'm tired.
- How long have we been walking?
- I don't know.
About three, four minutes.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Go on, Maynard, go home.
Scoot.
Come on, go.
You get.
You get.
Good bear.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you so much.
Hey, look, you saved my life.
What's your name, baby butt?
Hey.
Will.
Floyd.
Will Floyd, you ever been with a big woman?
I was in the Statue of Liberty once.
Hey.
Miss, miss.
Ohh.
Ohh.
- What is that on your teeth?
- Pudding.
Thanks, Carlton, I had almost forgotten about Bertha.
How could you forget?
You almost married her.
Man, this is getting complicated.
Boy, tell me about it.
That night we were enjoying a special dinner.
Our neighbor Sue Ellen was cooking something she had run over.
Sorry I'm late, but it was so beautiful I just couldn't leave the marina.
Chateaubriand?
Mmm!
- So how was your day, sweetheart?
- It was wonderful.
Oh, look what one of the girls taught me.
Now, a lot of families would just crumble under these circumstances.
But, once again, we are showing our true colors.
To family.
To family.
- Come on, Carlton.
There he is, Daddy.
There's the dirty varmint made me pregnant.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
I ain't make nobody pregnant.
You calling my daughter a liar?
No, man, it just wasn't me.
Of course it wasn't.
The boy just got to Deliverance.
Oh, is that so?
Fella over at the college says he's been going there for two years.
Oh, damn witness protection program.
Wedding's set for tomorrow at noon.
If you register at Tiffany's ask for Richard.
Oh, wait, hold on.
Nobody is registering for anything.
- Mister - McCoy, Hatfield McCoy.
Now, now, Mr. McCoy, now your daughter is a very, uh lovely woman and any man would be proud to be the father of her child but you cannot go around falsely accusing people.
Twelve o'clock.
You bring the groom, I'll bring the shotgun.
Bring it, Bertha.
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Oh, say, hey, hey, Mr. McCoy, listen.
Now, I would love to marry your daughter, you know, but I mean, who wouldn't?
Me.
Well, you see, it's my moms.
You know, see, she's in Africa and I'm her only child.
And it would just crush her to not be here to share in my happiness.
Well, we're real big on family so the wedding will take place just as soon as she gets back.
But the engagement party is tonight.
And at least I have this picture of you to keep in my drawers.
Whoa.
- Where did you get this?
- The general store.
Vern said some big fella's been asking about you.
He left it.
Come on, boys.
Oh, my God.
That means you-know-who is coming you-know-where.
I knew it was just a matter of time before O'Neill found me so I decided to fight fire with fire.
I enlisted the aid of my future father-in-law and his trigger-happy kin.
All right, listen, now, when you hear me say the word "family" that's when you coming running out, all right?
All right.
You heard my future son-in-law, now git.
As they ran off to take their positions I realized one thing: Hatfield didn't use deodorant.
I had to kill time before the killer came to kill me.
I thought about all those showdowns I'd seen in all those Westerns.
The good guys usually won.
Well, except for the Unforgiven where everybody got killed.
And then there was Posse which got killed at the box office.
If I were you, I would run.
If you were me, you'd be good-looking.
You know, usually, I try to detach myself from my work but I'm going to enjoy squeezing the life out of you.
"I'm really going to enjoy squeezing the life out of you.
"  You know why I'm not scared of you?
Because I got something that you don't have.
Family.
What are you talking about?
I got a sister in New Jersey.
I'm talking about family.
Family!
I mean, family.
It was obvious the McCoys didn't know when to say when.
Say, my man, you mind if I run inside and put on a big pot of coffee?
How did you get away?
Ante up and I'll tell you.
I'm out of money.
Then I'm out of story.
Wait a second.
That part about the bear wasn't true, was it?
None of it was true.
Mister, consider yourself hustled.
Why don't you come over for some poker tomorrow we'll tell you about Carlton and the alien.
You know, you guys are nothing but a bunch of stinking, thieving liars.
I have to go sit on a vase and get home to my wife.
Wow, hook, line and sinker.
Oh, yes, sir, I am the true fisherman.
When it comes to deception, you are the prince.
Oh, 9:00, I gotta get to bed.
Hey, good night, Little Zeke.
Good night, Will Floyd.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
All right, all right, all right.
That'll teach him to play with me.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
This piece is exquisite.
It certainly is.
And you can sense the artist's pain and yet it's a celebration of life.
Yo!
A swap meet.
This is Mr. Culture.
What you talking about, Uncle Phil?
I got me a capacity for paintings, man.
You know, I can sense what the artist is saying.
Oh, like this one.
What a brother got to do to get some fries?
See, and here, I can sense the juxtaposition of metaphors interspersed with the three-second violation.
You're a jackass.
What is that noise?
Geoffrey's using my electric shoe buffer.
That old thing with the frayed wires?
That's one of a kind.
They don't make them like that anymore.
I call this one workman's compensation.
Autumn, my favorite time of the year.
The leaves are falling and the hotties are pledging.
Here I go, girl.
Baby, if I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
Get it?
That's a double entendre.
Oh, Grey Poupon to you too, girl.
Hey, listen, what do you say we go have some dinner tonight?
You know, escargots and all that.
I don't think that will be a good idea.
I'm pledging Kappa and we sisters have to stick together.
That's right.
Your lines won't work with us, mister.
Lines?
What are y'all talking about?
These aren't lines.
You know what?
A woman cannot take it when a man is honest.
Look, when I take a woman out, I'm 100 percent gentleman.
- I'm opening car doors, paying for dinners.
- Car doors, paying for dinners.
And I treat a woman like a king treats a queen.
Y'all remembered those, huh?
Ladies, say goodbye to Will in his native tongue.
I don't believe you.
You're so desperate to get over, you gonna go out on your own blood.
I'm not trying to get over on anybody, Will.
Your problem is that you can't understand or respect women because you're not in touch with your feminine side.
You know what your problem is, C?
You're not in touch with anybody's feminine side.
Daddy, today I bought something for someone I really love.
I hope you enjoy it, sweetheart.
Daddy, it's for you.
Well, what do you think?
It's It's a Blue.
I bought it next door at the new country club.
It's a Marachi, handmade in Milan.
Don't you love it?
Try it on.
Well, ha, ha my first Marachi.
Okay.
Well, I just think that sweater looks gorgeous.
In fact, I'm gonna buy you a matching hat.
Oh, sweetheart Tell me, sir, do I wash that or take a weed whacker to it?
So, what are you talking about?
What is?
Carlton, quick, get a bat, let's bust this piñata.
Don't worry about it, Dad, he got his earlier.
Today, this entire group of girls made a fool out of Will.
Not one of them would fall for his lines.
Master William, it's for you.
A Lisa Wilkes.
Okay, one.
Carlton, man, can I help it if I say the things that women wanna hear?
What's up, chumpy?
It's confidence, son.
Women love a confident man.
Take me for instance.
Why, back in the day  I'd slip on the old dashiki puff up the old fro find a foxy mama, say, "Hey, baby, let's get it on.
"  And they bought that?
Actually, your mother was the only one.
Hey, Helen, they was out of Goobers, so I got us this large thing of popcorn.
Get out!
What you doing, Barney?
Yo, man, where Helen at?
She's probably at the chiropractor.
Helen!
Helen.
Oh, Will, don't let that spoil anything, because this has been the greatest night.
Well, if you like this one, wait till you see the sequel.
You are a dog.
The only problem is I really wanna be a Kappa and if they see me with you, they won't let me in.
Don't even worry about that, I'll wear a disguise.
I'll go Michael Jackson style.
You don't need to go that far.
I'm house-sitting a friend's cabin this weekend and I wouldn't mind a little company.
Little company?
I'm more like the Fortune 500, you know?
AT&T.
Reach out and touch a brother if you got your bill paid.
Will, where are you going?
Oh, to the cabin.
That's tomorrow.
Oh, cool.
Well, let's get back to the movie.
I was so lucky I found this hat.
It was the last extra extra extra large.
Well, gee, the gods must be smiling on me.
And I'd guess there's some laughing and pointing going on too.
Oh, honey, I think it's cute.
Really?
I'm going to the pro shop to buy you a matching outfit right now.
Well, honey, I quit playing golf.
Look at this.
You could at least yell four!
I'll take care of it, Miss Ashley.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
You know, when they redesigned this golf course I thought it might raise our property values.
But it's making it dangerous for us to be here.
Sir, perhaps you could get them to erect a fence.
Geoffrey.
MAN : Always and forever Each moment with you Will, you're so romantic, I don't know why you have such a horrible reputation.
Yeah, you know, I'm really just misunderstood.
You spend a little time with me, you'll see I'm actually pretty cool.
Now, where were we?
Why don't we just dance?
MAN : With a smile Take time Oh, I just love these romantic songs.
Baby, this song is not even good enough for you.
I could write you the best love song ever.
Okay.
Let's hear it.
Oh, well, you see, um I'm not really that good at thinking on my feet.
Not yet.
- How about we play a little game first?
- Oh, cool.
Here, have a seat.
Oh, what kind of game?
We're gonna play cops and robbers.
Oh, girl now Make it more better now I'm gonna be the cop and you're gonna be the nasty old robber.
Just call me public enemy number one.
So how do you like the game so far?
Beat the hell out of playing Stratego with Carlton.
Ow!
That's kind of tight.
Oh, I mean, I know my rights.
I think I'm entitled to one frisk.
Shut up!
Huh?
I thought you were good, but you're not good.
You've caused so much pain to so many women.
You're just a dirty dog.
And now it's payback time.
Baby, you're kind of killing the mood.
Ow!
What are you, a psycho?
You don't know how tired I am of hearing that.
Huh?
Hello?
Hey, hey.
Nicky, it's Will.
Oh, hi, Will.
Nicky, I need some help.
I need you to get a grownup.
Carlton!
Nicky, I said a grownup.
Carlton Banks here.
Carlton, it's Will.
I'm up at Lake Arrowhead with Lisa.
Listen, she got me tied to a chair, man.
Oh, stop bragging, you sick pervert.
- Who's a pervert?
- Oh, I'm just teasing Will.
See, some girls are playing a trick on him at some cabin.
- What kind of trick?
- They're going to terrorize and torture him.
Oh, don't worry, it's all in good fun.
Oh.
So Mr. Dirty Dog is trying to make a phone call, is he?
So you mean to tell me for 5 extra dollars, I could get HBO?
Okay, basic cable is cool.
I hope you don't mind if I freshen up a little bit for you.
What you doing?
I just wanna look pretty for you.
And you do.
You do.
You know, I saw a great dress to go with that lipstick.
You did?
Yeah, and you know what, if you untie me we'll drive down and get it before it closes.
Do I look like a fool to you?
No, not a fool.
Hey, wait, wait, where you going?
To get the dress.
Oh, Lord.
Ooh.
Ooh!
Hot.
Ooh!
Hot.
Hot What did you just do?
This.
Think we can get away with this?
I can't believe you two.
Mustard is not the answer.
No, she's right.
Get the soy sauce.
Four!
- Wow, it's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
- Thank you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Hey, how are you?
That will be $140.
Jeez, I'm so sorry.
You know, putting is the worst part of my game.
Hey, nice sweaters.
Oh, Marachi.
Our daughter bought them for us.
She's got great taste.
Hey, Mr. Kareem, they're waiting for you on the tee.
Got to run, ciao.
- Bye.
- Ciao.
You know, honey, the color of this sweater does compliment your eyes.
Well, it is comfy.
Let's go get the stains out.
These are my role models.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
How you doing there, Little Miss Mood Swing?
Give me the keys to the car.
Oh, now I'm never gonna get in.
You need to be worried about getting out.
Them rubber rooms ain't got no windows.
Will, I am not crazy, okay?
This whole thing was a sorority prank.
They wanted me to teach you a lesson.
In what, bladder control?
No, respect for women.
Ugh!
I cannot believe you sorority girls could be so devious.
It was actually your cousin Carlton's idea.
Oh, yeah?
You know what, I'm gonna pop that little zit when I get home.
You give me the car keys.
Thank you.
What you crying about?
You don't care.
You're damn right I don't care.
You damn near fricasseed me.
But seriously, though, what you crying about?
Will, the only reason I did this is because I wanna be a Kappa.
So I guess that if I don't go through with this thing then you can kiss your pledge pin goodbye.
Oh, well.
I deserve that.
Will, I just want you to know that this is the best date that I've had in a long time.
I mean, before I tied you up.
Like I'm supposed to believe that.
Pfft!
For real?
WILL : You're right, I'm so sorry.
I'm a dog.
I'm the fresh prince of the pound.
The doggiest of all dogs.
Unbelievable.
Will Smith apologizing.
My sisters, welcome the newest member of Kappa Phi Gamma, Lisa Wilkes.
All right.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, hold up.
What, y'all just gonna leave me hanging up here like a piece of Rotisserie Gold, huh?
What's wrong, Will?
Rough weekend?
Carlton man, listen, my date with Lisa didn't quite turn out the way I planned.
Pray tell, why not?
We got up there, the girl went crazy.
She tied me to this chair, was trying to torture me.
No.
But I got loose, man.
Then she really went off.
So I grabbed this rock, man  and I Oh, my God, she's still up there.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
Oh, Lisa!
Gotcha.
No!
No!
Tell me you didn't.
Oh, God.
No, no, no.
Will, no.
Oh, my God, no!
Oh, no.
How could you do that?
Oh, no.
Oh, my Oh, God.
Oh, God.
No.
No.
Oh, God, how could he do that?
How could he do that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Mail call.
- Wall Street Journal for Master Carlton.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
A statement from The Bank of Bel-Air for Miss Ashley.
And a plain brown package for me.
I'll be taking my break now.
Bank of Bel-Air?
Yeah.
Well, bye.
See you later, Ash.
Something's afoot.
And something's a foot and a half.
I'm talking about Ashley.
I know where every penny of this family's money is.
- And none of it is in the Bank of Bel-Air.
- So?
So, obviously, Ashley's hoarding money.
And I know why.
She's amassing a private fortune so she can buy out the family business in a hostile takeover.
A sweater and a string of pearls and you'd be Angela Lansbury.
Ouch!
Shoot!
Ashley, what are you doing?
Changing for school.
See, um Today is, uh, casual day.
Well, uh, that sounds like the, uh, truth.
Actually, Will, I've been keeping a secret.
- Lf I don't tell someone, I'm gonna explode.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't tell me.
If I know, I can't say I don't know when you get busted and Uncle Phil start rounding up the usual suspects.
And I am the usual suspects.
I dropped out of Bel-Air Academy.
I've been going to public school since the beginning of the semester.
I didn't hear that.
- I said I dropped out.
- I heard what you said, Ashley.
Ash, what are you?
How can you do that?
It was easy.
I forged all the papers took Daddy's tuition money and put it in an interest-bearing account.
Pretty good, huh?
You're tripping?
No, no No, no.
You're worse than tripping.
You've fallen and you can't get up.
And he will find out.
And when he does, he's going to ground you into dust.
Will, you don't understand.
Everything's so fake at Bel-Air Academy.
The teachers, the kids, the noses.
I can't take it anymore.
Please don't tell Daddy.
I ain't gonna dime you but if he subpoenas me, I'm gonna be singing like Luther.
I'm in.
Ha-ha-ha.
Will, come here.
Okay.
"Bank of Bel-Air"?
How did you tap into those records?
Well, I overrode the configuration files and deleted the encrypted password.
Goodness.
It's Hack Boy, the stubby-fingered avenger.
Go ahead and joke.
But sometimes you have to go around the law to expose the greater evil.
Ashley's hiding $10,000.
Now, where did she get that kind of money?
Maybe she's Counterfeit Girl, the sister of Hack Boy.
Look, it's none of your business.
Why don't you just butt out?
Oh, I see.
She's already gotten to you.
Trust no one.
Will, I don't get it.
My producer told me that I'm losing my black audience.
I don't see why, Hil.
I mean, you got the best talk show on TV.
You really think so?
Well, what was your favorite topic?
Uh Uh, the one with the, uh Dysfunctional, uh, single parent, uh, gang member nuns.
Hil, I've never actually seen one of your shows.
- Will.
- Look, listen, Hilary, I'm sorry.
You need to do some stuff that reaches out to your brothers and sisters.
Why?
What have Carlton and Ashley ever done for me?
Whoa, if it isn't Belly D. Williams.
Just kidding.
You look great.
Where you all going?
Fundraiser at the museum.
- Do I hate these things.
- Why agree to be on the Board of Trustees?
Well, I'm a judge and judges are supposed to be on boards.
Well, it's just that with you, it's usually a smorgasbord.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, baby.
Hi, honey.
Will, I need to talk to you.
Bye.
It's girl talk.
Will, my homeroom teacher insists on meeting my parents.
I've already canceled five times.
She wants to see someone tonight.
You're just gonna have to come clean with Uncle Phil.
- I can't.
I'm waiting for the right time.
- And when is that?
When we go shopping for my cap and gown.
That's assuming that you're gonna live till graduation.
Will, I need your help.
Ashley, let me sum this up for you in two words: Unh-unh.
You know, I didn't want to have to say this.
But it's your fault I'm in this mess.
My fault?
Oh, this one here gonna be good.
Before you showed up, I was leading a nice, sheltered existence.
But you made me see there was a whole world beyond Bel-Air filled with people who take public transportation and don't have butlers.
I like that world.
It's like a drug, Will, and you got me hooked.
Well, you better go cold turkey before you wind up a dead duck.
- Will.
- Ashley, no.
Now, I'm sorry that you got yourself into this little predicament.
But trying to blame it on me, now, that's just low.
You're right.
I can't believe I said that.
You've always been so good to me.
I'm just so desperate.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
No No, no.
Look, don't cry, Ashley.
Come on.
Come on, all right.
We'll figure a way out of this, all right?
Thanks, Will.
You're a saint.
Wait.
What was that?
What?
You smiled.
I saw your reflection in the window.
Oh, no.
That was a happy smile.
See?
I don't believe I fell for them tears.
- Girl, you're on your own.
- All right, fine!
Be that way!
But if I go down, I'm taking you with me.
Ashley.
I didn't do nothing.
You wanna call your parents and see what happened?
No.
Maybe we should reschedule again.
Ashley.
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Miss Sharpe - the truth is I  Ashley.
There's my little bran muffin.
Oh.
Is this your father?
Sure.
Heh.
Miss Sharpe, this is, uh, Daddy.
Mm.
How could something so smooth be called sharp?
Yes.
Well, nice to finally meet you, Mr. Banks.
Rhaul, please.
Rhaul.
Oh, and welcome back from the Orient.
God bless you, Miss Sharpe.
It is Miss Sharpe, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
Mm.
You're a fine teacher, Miss Sharpe.
Hey, I bet you could teach me a thing or two  On the academic side, I mean.
Well, will Mrs. Banks be joining us?
Uh, no, I'm single.
I mean, um, Ashley's mother ran out on us.
Ashley was but a mere tyke at the time.
I had to be both Mommy and Daddy.
We went from training wheels to training bras.
They both came off too soon, didn't they kitten?
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, anyway, about Ashley's schoolwork.
You should be very proud of her.
She does excellent work.
She participates actively in class and she's just a pleasure to have around.
You know, that runs in the family.
Yes.
Well.
Ahem.
Do you have any questions?
No.
Not a one.
Well, thank you for your time.
What do you say we have the next meeting at my place, huh?
- Well, I don't know.
L - Thanks for being so understanding.
Come on, Daddy.
It's time for your pill.
It's a miracle this whole thing worked.
What you talking about, girl?
Denzel ain't the only brother than can act.
Well, at least this buys me some time before I have to break the news to Daddy.
Well, I have to get my history books.
You stay right here, Rhaul.
I made that up.
- Mr. Banks, did you forget something?
- Uh, you know, I'm glad you asked.
I, uh, forgot to give you the number to my direct line.
- Look, I'm very flattered, but - You know that is an absolutely intoxicating fragrance that you're wearing.
Uh Come closer.
Hey.
That's a fake mustache.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I'm calling your real parents right now.
Will?
No, it's not.
Miss Sharpe.
It's not.
You just had to go back.
We were out the door, Will.
We were free.
Free!
Look, ease up, Miss Tubman.
Miss Sharpe gave us the weekend to break it to Uncle Phil.
Now, let's go over this evil twin story again.
I'm sure the mayor's mother meant it as a compliment.
Oh, really?
Then I should be honored that she thinks I look like a black Alfred Hitchcock.
Hi, kids.
Good evening.
Wow.
Good night.
Ashley.
Ashley.
Okay.
Mom, Dad, it's like this.
- Will has something he wants to tell you.
- I ain't got nothing.
Um Your Honor, uh now, before you deliver your verdict the defense dictates that you sustain the motion of the ocean.
Because most parents want the truth, but they can't handle the truth.
So in conclusion, I move for a change of venue.
- You give us a half-hour head start.
- What the hell are you talking about?
Daddy, I withdrew from Bel-Air Academy six weeks ago and transferred to Morris High.
You what?
I'm not mad.
You're not?
And you thought he was gonna be mad.
Well, you transferred out, you'll transfer back.
Tomorrow when I wake up Ashley will be back in Bel-Air Academy and maybe Will won't even be here.
Daddy, I'm not going back.
Now I'm mad.
- You knew about this.
No.
Will didn't do anything wrong.
- That's right, you tell him.
- If anything, I should thank Will.
- He's the whole reason I transferred.
- Whoa, whoa.
Pull it back, baby.
Pull it back.
Like I'm doing.
Pull it back.
Daddy, Will made me realize how limited my life has been.
I wanna be with real people with real concerns.
Oh, and people in Bel-Air don't have real concerns?
- It's pronounced Porsche.
Porsche.
- Porsche.
- Porsche.
- Ashley, honey, you lied to us.
- I knew you'd say no.
But, honey, we just want you to have the best education possible.
Mom, Bel-Air Academy doesn't equal better.
You and Dad both went to public schools.
Whoa, good point, Ash.
- Can't we at least discuss this?
- I believe we just did.
- San Tropez.
- San Tropez.
Will, I took your advice and reached out to our brothers and sisters.
Heh.
Look at this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello and welcome to Hilary.
As an African American woman I'd like to dedicate this show to all my sisters.
Presenting fashions from the motherland.
Inga is wearing a hand-woven dashiki from Nairobi.
Her jewelry is from the Ivory Coast and her weave is from Whoopi Goldberg's House of Hair.
Work it, you Nubian princess, you.
Ha, ha.
Our next model is Buffie.
Um, Hil, I just I I really wanna commend your attempt to reach out to your African American viewers - but you forgot one thing.
- What?
African Americans.
Oh.
Carlton, she went to private school, didn't she?
Touché.
But there's a bigger issue here.
People talk.
What if an admissions officer at Princeton found out my sister was going to public school?
I mean, my God.
Daddy, I'd like you to meet someone.
This is Miss Sharpe.
She's my homeroom teacher at Morris High.
Miss Sharpe, this is my father.
The real one.
Thanks, Ashley.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Same here.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thank you.
I thought if we met I could allay any concerns you might have.
Well, Miss Sharpe you made quite an impression upon my daughter.
But, with all due respect, I am thoroughly satisfied with the education Ashley is receiving at Bel-Air Academy.
Perhaps you're not aware of Morris High's academic achievements.
I don't doubt that Morris High is a fine institution but I've already made my decision.
I'm sorry to hear that.
One of the things I've admired about Ashley is her open mind.
Well, she gets that from her mother.
Ha-ha-ha.
Uncle Phil, the phone Ooh.
Hey, listen, man.
I can explain everything.
Look, I was dizzy, then I came I was Uh, you must be Will.
I'm Miss Sharpe.
Oh, nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
Hey, you know, Uncle Phil, that's the first time I ever met her in life.
Mr. Banks, we were profiled here in Education Today.
Maybe if you read it, you'll reconsider.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry you had to drive out here for nothing.
- Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
Whoo.
She really something, huh?
Hard to say no to her.
Not if you're a parent.
Ahem.
Hey, come on, Uncle Phil.
Be reasonable.
When's the last time a teacher from Bel-Air Academy came to the house?
Look, the girl went and changed schools behind my back.
Now, in this house, that constitutes a capital crime.
But she had a good reason.
Look, my wife's nephew.
I want Ashley in Bel-Air Academy where there's a controlled environment.
I know who's there.
But, more importantly, I know who's not.
Listen, I'm telling you.
I went to both public and private schools and I'm saying in public school, it's more different kinds of people.
In Bel-Air Academy, everybody cut from the same mold.
If you ask me, you acting like a Snob.
I'm gonna just go.
And a one and a Hell with that.
The forecast for the - Philip, look here.
Morris High School is fourth in the country among magnet schools.
Magnet schools?
Maybe that's why they need metal detectors, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.
- This is important.
Don't make jokes.
- Vivian, we've made our decision.
We?
No, you've made a decision.
I'm a college professor.
You didn't even ask my opinion.
Didn't I?
I'm sure I did.
I'm sorry, honey.
What do you think?
I think we should at least consider it.
Sometimes I think we work so hard to give our kids what we didn't have sometimes we forget to give them what we did have.
- Good morning, Will.
Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Good morning, Ashley.
Good morning.
What are you eating?
Food.
What are you doing?
Cutting the tension.
Good morning, everyone.
Hey, Hil.
So, what's today's black topic?
Amish rap stars?
I'm through chasing one specific demographic.
Thanks to my leopard skin midriff top, I hit an all-time high with male viewers.
I got more men yesterday than Sally Jesse Raphael gets in a year.
How hard could that be?
Where are you going?
- School.
Since when do you wear a uniform to public school?
What are you talking about?
Your mother and I had a long talk last night.
I called Miss Sharpe and made an appointment to check it out.
Now, if I'm satisfied with what I see, you can give it a shot for a semester.
Oh, Daddy, thank you.
- We're gonna be late.
Go change.
- Okay.
Oh, Uncle Phil, thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
So this is what you want, huh?
You want some of me  One more point and I win.
It's not over yet, pal.
Well, basically it is.
I'm gonna just sink this last shot for this final nail in your coffin.
Always so cocksure of yourself, aren't you?
Always the big winner.
You may think you're better than me, but I've got something you don't.
Tenacity.
If you think I'm gonna stand here and let you win then you've got another thing coming.
Twentyone-eighteen, I win.
Hey, you wanna play again?
Same rules as last game?
Yeah, sure.
Zero-eighteen.
- Any big plans tonight, Carlton?
- I have a date.
- With whom?
- Same lady I see every Saturday night.
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.
Ashley, what do you say to the two of us girls going out tonight?
Gee, Hilary, I'd love to, but I have a date.
Well, you can come along if you like.
- Well, I don't wanna tag along or anything - I understand.
Look, I had a great time too, Lola.
Hey, thanks for paying, baby.
I can't stand this.
Everyone has a date except me.
What's the problem, Hil?
I mean, come on.
You're pretty, you're fun, you're intelli Vision.
Well, that's exactly the problem.
I'm a celebrity and men are intimidated by me.
I'm a beautiful woman trapped in an even more beautiful woman's body.
Just got back from dropping Nicky off at his first sleepover party.
I met some of the parents, I couldn't believe it.
Most of them are only few years older than you kids.
Didn't none of them kids look like me, did they, Uncle Phil?
I was just checking, man, just checking.
Everybody, you've gotta come see this.
Phil, the package came from Soul Train.
Really?
- Wait till you see this, guys.
This isn't gonna take long, is it?
I have a date.
We know.
Go ahead, Mom.
Put it on.
- Okay.
Vivian, please, do we have to?
Welcome back.
Now we're gonna play the Soul Train Scramble game.
Let's meet today's couple.
You are?
- Vivian Smith, Scorpio.
- Oh, Philip Banks.
Solid.
All right, you know the rules.
If you can unscramble our mystery artist you win a lifetime supply of Afro Sheen.
Okay?
- Ready?
Go.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Phil, but that's wrong.
The answer is James Brown.
No, my man, it's not wrong.
See, foxy mama ever since I met you, I knew that the deal we had was righteous.
And I know out of all the cats out there, I'm not the downest.
It's just that I want our gigs to groove together forever.
- Do you dig it?
- You're my main man.
Now, that's true love.
Let's send them on their way with Marvin and Tammi and "You're All I Need.
" TAMMI : You're all I need to get by  So, Uncle Phil, you proposed on Soul Train, huh?
Where you all get married at, The Flip Wilson Show?
I think it's so romantic.
Soul Train's having a 25-year reunion and we've been named as one of the 10 most memorable couples.
- Well, isn't that great?
- The whole family's invited.
All right.
Hey, let me tell y'all when I was growing up in Philly, Soul Train was the bomb.
Hey, I still got my miniature Don Cornelius with the lifelike voice.
You can bet your last money it's gonna be a stone gas, honey.
And until next time, love, peace and Soul!
You played with a doll?
Ain't Ain't no doll, man, it's an action figure.
Afro pick sold separately.
Hey.
Hey, Uncle Phil, man.
You was like a real cool, hip, handsome dude back then, man.
What happened?
Man.
No slap in the head or nothing.
I'm scared.
Carlton, what's wrong, man?
Are you having a Maalox moment?
I'm practicing for Soul Train.
I understand there's some dancing involved.
Two things, Carlton.
One, that's not dancing.
Two, I would appreciate it if you stayed away from the show.
And why, pray tell, is that?
Again, two things, Carlton.
One, because you say stuff like "pray tell.
" And, two, you're gonna mess up my chances of being the new co-host.
You're going to be the new co-host?
Gee, I guess they forgot to fax me that press release.
Well, let me break it down for you, Teeny Petito.
Now, Soul Train has been looking for a new co-host.
And so far, nobody's worked out.
And they're going to give you the co-host job based on what?
Your love of Don Cornelius dolls?
It's not a doll, man, it's an action figure.
And you got no business even being on the Soul Hyundai let alone the Soul Train.
So stay away from the show so you don't embarrass me.
Me?
You're the embarrassment, you urban urchin.
I know you don't think I'm good enough for Soul Train.
But when I get there, I'll dance circles around you.
Carlton Banks, soul brother number one.
Philip.
Look, honey, it still fits.
Yes, but can you breathe?
It may have shrunk a little.
Sweetheart, I think the suit's the same size.
I said it must have shrunk a little.
Yes, well, look, we can't go to Soul Train anyway.
I checked my schedule, and that's the same night as the Bar Association's chili cook-off.
- So?
- Well, Vivian, you know I'm up for election.
If I wanna keep my seat on the bench, I have to make appearances.
Plus, it's damn good chili.
Philip, this evening is very special to me and it should be to you too.
It is special to me, but I have a conflict that evening.
You got a conflict tonight too.
See you're working your magic again, huh?
Oh, she is being completely unreasonable.
I can't go to Soul Train because I have a more important commitment.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.
What could be more important than Soul Train?
A chili cook-off.
Well Well, it's a major political event.
Uh Besides, my feet hurt and, well, I'm afraid my head will look shiny on camera.
You know what, Uncle Phil?
I know what your problem is, man.
You know what?
Don't even worry about it.
I got you covered.
Now get your head in there.
Yeah, now pick up your feet.
Put it all together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie Sue.
Yeah.
Oh, you got it, Uncle Phil, there you go, there you go.
What is this?
Uncle Phil was feeling a little gun-shy about his grooves.
I got Lamont to come over, give him some dance lessons.
That's right, Philly Gilly.
Now, lesson number two is shake your groove thing.
If that's a groove, the Grand Canyon's a ditch.
That's it.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Philly Gilly, don't be - That's it.
- Uncle Phil, Lamont Look, Will, I'm not gonna have some platformed freak make a fool out of me.
Whoa, you're talking about one of the original Solid Gold Dancers.
I danced at Sam Cooke's funeral.
You're gonna be dancing at your own funeral if you don't get out of my house.
Overgrown Isaac Hayes-looking fool.
Philip, that was so rude.
I'm gonna go apologize to the man.
All right, all right.
Come on, Uncle Phil, what's bothering you?
Right now, you are.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man, let me have it.
What's the problem?
Will, do you know what I'd do if I even thought for one second that you were anywhere near my problem?
No, what?
I'd build a fence to keep you away.
One with barbed wire and maybe a sniper up on the roof to pick you off just in case you got over the fence.
And given the slightest chance that he'd miss there'd be two rottweilers guarding my problem.
You don't want my help, do you?
- I'll go.
- Okay.
Philip, what is the matter with you?
Vivian, it's this Soul Train business.
I feel like a dinosaur that somebody wants to put on display.
Don't you realize how special this night is to me?
All right, fine, I'll go.
Philip, don't do me any favors.
I'm not doing you any favors.
I want to go, okay?
No, you don't.
And you know what?
I think I might just rather go by myself.
Vivian.
Vivian.
WILL : Welcome to the Soul Train 25th Anniversary Special.
I'm Don Cornelius.
Before we get started, I'd like to say: Get that damn flashlight out of my face!
You kill me, Don.
Are you still playing with that doll?
Action figure, action figure.
Is that so hard to understand?
Look, forget your stupid doll.
Action figure.
I'm worried about my parents.
I've been listening outside their bedroom.
Carlton, he's not hurting her.
No, I mean, they've been arguing all night.
Come on, man.
Look, they're a married couple.
Arguing is what married's being all about.
I mean, I'm sure whatever their problem is, they'll work it out.
I hope.
Geoffrey.
If you weren't my butler and had a decent job would you ask me out or would you be too intimidated?
Geoffrey.
Sorry, I got caught up in the fantasy.
About me?
No, about that decent job.
Tell me, do I have a desk?
Hilary, sit down.
I want you to take this test on your dateability.
Please, like some little quiz in Seventeen magazine has anything to do with my life.
Come on, Hilary, it's just for fun.
- Okay, okay.
- All right.
Question one.
You're on a date and the guy tries to kiss you, what do you do?
I don't have a date.
Must you throw that in my face?
Will, what's wrong?
Uncle Phil's staying with us in the pool house.
Oh, I know it's upsetting, honey, but we'll work things out.
Oh, no, he was clipping his toenails, I took one in the eye.
I was thinking about going to Soul Train by myself.
Would you be my dance partner?
Ooh.
Uh, Aunt Viv, you know, I'd love to take you.
You know, but this is Soul Train.
I got to get my mack on, you know.
Which is kind of difficult to do when you go there with somebody old.
Oh, I mean I mean I mean I mean that's kid talk, Aunt Viv.
You know how kids talk.
You know, bad means good.
And stupid means great.
And old means beautiful.
You are so old.
You are the oldest person I ever seen.
- We leave at 8.
- I will be ready.
Welcome to the Soul Train And now here's a little something to kick us off.
SELDA : I'll be your answer, I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy Your favorite dish From the back to the middle And around again I'm gonna be there till the end One hundred percent pure love From the back to the middle And around again I'm gonna be there till the end One hundred percent pure love You saw a brand-new high Thought that you could fly Did I hear you cry Or did you like the ride Will, I thought you were with me.
Aunt Viv.
Hm, hm.
Is that your aunt?
Oh, yeah, but we see other people.
What a freak.
SELDA : So don't you fight I'll be your answer I'll be your wish Geoffrey?
Please, Miss Ashley, don't give me away.
And now, before I introduce our next hot single say hello to my man Bootsy Collins.
And now, here's an oldie but a goody.
Hey, Aunt Viv, how about that dance now?
No, you go do your thing, Will.
I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, hey, hey.
Come on, Aunt Viv.
Let's hit the floor.
I'm going.
It's not the same without Philip.
You kids have fun.
Aunt Viv.
I believe I owe you a dance.
And let's reach all the way back to a personal favorite.
Here's Marvin and Tammi's "You're All I Need.
" MARVIN : You're all I need to get by You know, Vivian?
From the night I first met you, I knew that the deal we had was righteous.
Now, I may not be the downest cat out here.
I just want our lives to groove together forever.
You are still my main man.
You know, sweetheart, when we first danced together on Soul Train we had our whole lives to look forward to.
I guess it's a lot easier to look ahead than it is to look back.
But as long as I'm with you, there is only now.
Isn't it romantic?
Don't touch me.
All right, now all aboard, you guys, for the Soul Train Line.
MAN : Flashlight Flashlight Red light Flashlight CROWD : Go, Bootsy!

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Oh, Casablanca always makes me cry.
Oh, good.
I thought it was me.
No.
Will, I really had a good time tonight.
Yeah, me too.
Look, um, Lisa, don't take this the wrong way.
What?
Can I?
Can I see you?
Can you see me what?
Can I see you again?
You want another date?
- Sure.
- Cool.
Phew.
You know, I ain't talking about marriage or nothing, though.
- Thanks, Daddy.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.
Everybody clear about their duties at the carnival?
Yes.
I'll be manning the "guess your birthday" booth.
Oh, do me, do me.
Hilary, you're August 18th.
Wow, you are good.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Step right up.
Step right up.
Come see the amazing Rock Dwarfsky the world's shortest square-headed Negro.
Hey.
Someone to see you, Master William.
It's a girl.
Heh, heh.
Hey, Lisa, what's up, baby?
What you doing here?
You left your book at the library.
What was he doing there?
Lisa, this is my family.
Family, this is my Lisa.
- Hi.
Hi.
- Would you like some breakfast?
- Oh, no, I have to run to work.
But it was nice to meet you all.
Same here.
Nice meeting you.
Bye-bye.
- Hey, so - We gonna hook up at the bowling alley?
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.
- All right.
- See you later.
- All right.
What?
I've seen this look before.
The facial flush, the flare in his nostrils.
Look at his eyes.
All right.
Well, I'm saying, yeah, you know, I like her.
Will has a girlfriend, Will has a girlfriend.
We choose not to define our relationship.
Well, whatever.
Lisa has it all.
Intelligence, great dresser, nice body.
God, I'm lonely.
I wonder why you don't see a lot of black professional bowlers.
Ain't no money in it.
Look how much dough could a brother make endorsing a pair of these?
It'd be like, "Hi, I'm Darnell Washington, pro bowler.
Whenever I'm about to roll me a 300 game, I like to do it in these.
Air Ghettos.
" - Will, you are so silly.
- Well, you know, I try.
Come here, let me help you with that.
Not too tight.
Ladies first.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Lisa Wilkes is about to step up to the lane.
Your form look good from here.
- Whoo!
A strike.
I'm in the house.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
Girl, you just won yourself a date to a carnival with an ebony god.
Really?
- I'd rather go with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Look out, girl, it's Darnell's turn now.
- Go, Darnell.
Excuse me, Dark Gable.
In case you didn't notice, this is my date.
- I told him.
- Say, baby why don't you ditch the go-cart and step up to a stretch limo?
Excuse me, Messy Snipes?
Listen, why don't you just take your limo and ease on up out my face, all right?
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
Will.
Will, just let it go.
No, no, baby.
He started this, now I'm gonna finish it.
Lisa just saved your butt.
Get off, get off.
Where did that come from?
I've been meaning to tell you I'm a A what?
A Power Ranger?
I've studied a couple years of self-defense.
- Did I do something wrong?
- Yes, you did.
I was just about to retaliate.
- Baby, you were on the floor.
- That's how I fight.
- Officer.
Officer, it was him.
Yeah.
He started it.
Right there.
All right, it's no big deal, Will.
Let's just get back to bowling.
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, let's get back to bowling.
All right.
That one didn't count.
Step right up, step right up.
Test your accuracy.
You, sir, with the big ears.
How about testing your skill?
Come on, it's only three throws Hey.
Aunt Viv, where's the rest of the family?
Well, Ashley's showing Nicky around, and your uncle's in a pie-eating contest.
- How'd you do, honey?
- Piece of cake.
Come on, baby, let me buy you a hot dog.
- See you later.
- Hey.
You, sir, how about a throw?
- I don't think I should.
What's the matter?
Got a noodle for an arm?
Carlton, that's Ken Griffey Jr., man.
Tell you what.
Since Will seems to know you how about a throw for half the price?
All right.
Who's he?
He is one of the highest paid players in baseball.
Hilary, this guy makes, like, a quadrillion dollars a year.
- Hi, quarterback.
- How you doing?
I'm kind of chilly.
Wanna take me to Hawaii?
Sorry, I'm married.
Then stop flirting with me.
- Hey.
Ken, what's up, man?
- What's up?
Looks like that strike took a toll on your throwing arm, huh?
Well, at least I don't have my woman fighting my battles for me.
Hey, Lisa.
What are you doing here?
You invited me, remember?
Well, yeah, you know, but that was before the incident.
Will, you shouldn't be threatened by my knowledge of shotokan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
First, I don't care if you know Chaka Khan.
I ain't threatened by nobody.
- Will, why don't?
- You know what?
I'm gonna just go get me a little something to drink, all right?
What's wrong with Will?
Carlton, can I confide in you?
I feel it too, Lisa.
Feel what?
Never mind.
Can't believe it.
This place is so crowded, can't even get a soda.
Will, it's a carnival, relax.
Listen, let's go play a game.
- You can win me a stuffed animal.
- Oh, why?
So you can beat the stuffing out of it?
Lisa, I'm telling you, I had that guy.
- Will.
- Had him!
Will, I was only trying to help.
If you wanted to help, you should have let that fella bash my face in.
- Now, that would have been helpful.
- Now, let me get this straight.
You'd rather a guy bash your face in than to have a woman who likes this face step in and save it?
Finally you understand.
Yeah, I think I do.
- I'm leaving.
- Hey, hey, Lisa.
Nothing.
Banks residence.
One moment, please, I'll check.
Miss Lisa on the phone.
G, look, just tell her I'm at the store.
He says he's at the store.
Yes, I'll tell him you called.
Will, I think it's inexcusable what that friend Lisa of yours did yesterday.
Thank you.
Finally somebody who understands my side of it.
Of course I do.
If I was with a wimp who couldn't defend himself, I'd just leave.
You know what?
That's it.
I'm putting an end to this mess right now.
Hello?
Mr. Yoshi?
Yiki-Yo, Yoshi?
Hey.
Uncle Phil, what you doing here?
Chan, you have offended my family.
Now I must avenge my brother's death.
Having fun?
Oh.
Uh.
Sorry.
Listen, I was just That's okay, everybody likes to do that.
What the heck happened to my coffee table?
Sorry about that.
Hey, I'm Will Smith.
I come to learn karate from the greatest, most revered master the martial arts world has ever known.
Oh, well, I Hey, listen, man, I wanna be just like Steven Seagal.
Oh, you wanna be a bad actor.
Ha-ha-ha.
Yes, I can teach you the art of self-defense.
But first you must learn the Japanese philosophies patience, discipline.
Yeah, that's cool, but can we hurry?
I gotta whup somebody's butt quick.
Please sit.
Now, once upon a time, there was a great samurai warrior named Akira Yoshimora.
Ooh.
Good story.
Listen, can you teach me that thing where you ram somebody's nose up into they brain?
Akira's quest in life was to slay the most feared dragon in order to prove his worth as a warrior.
But he never found the dragon.
And on his deathbed, he finally realized that his search was pointless for the most feared dragon was within, not without.
Without what?
I see symbolism is not one of your strong points.
But let me try again.
The silkworm is a very fastidious little creature.
And then by the time the silkworm made it to Tibet, I was done with him.
Your situation reminds me of the one Theotis Jones was in.
Theotis Jones?
Yeah, his woman rescued his butt in some fight just like yours did.
Well, what did he do?
Last I heard, he was playing Diana Ross in La Cage aux Folles.
So, what am I supposed to do, Jazz?
Only one thing to do.
I give you the hoodlum pages.
Let's see.
Counterfeiters, extortionists, car salesmen.
- Here it is.
Guys who take dives.
- Wait, give me this.
Wait a minute, this guy will let me punch him 10 times for 40 dollars?
Mention this ad, and he'll throw in a head butt.
Okay.
So dude comes down to the Peacock he kicks up a little static, I lay him down.
Lisa and everybody thinks I'm a hero.
Ahh.
Hey, man, where'd you get this from anyway?
I stole it.
Will.
I'm glad you finally decided to call me.
Yeah, I figured we needed to, you know, talk about what happened.
Yeah, definitely.
Um, go ahead.
- What?
- Talk.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, listen.
Maybe we should have a cappuccino first, you know.
Just to warm up to our conversation.
- Sure.
- All right.
Hey, man, who you shov?
All right, this is a stickup.
Everyone on the floor!
Don't anyone try to be a hero.
Let's have the cash, Webster.
Fine, take the money.
But then what?
Holed up in some fleabag motel waiting for the man to come and take you away.
And all that's left is to walk that last long, lonely mile with the Lord's Prayer Will you give the man the damn money?
All right, get down.
Don't you move.
- All right, it's showtime.
- What?
All right, buddy, you ain't going nowhere.
Will, don't be a fool.
I'm warning you, pal, this thing is loaded.
Hey, look, point it right at me.
Make it look real.
Huh?
I said, "Hyah"!
Thank you, thank you.
Lisa, come stand by my side.
That was the most foolish thing I've ever seen.
You could have been killed.
- No, but, baby Baby  No.
Jazz, you can take your fake cop.
Lisa left.
Will, he's real.
And so is he.
And all that for only 40 bucks?
Hey, Uncle Phil, what's up, man?
You busy?
Yes, I am.
Listen.
Uncle Phil, I've been acting real dumb.
Mm-hm.
Look, I know what you thinking, what's new?
But usually I know why I be tripping, man, but this time I don't have no clue.
This is about you and Lisa, isn't it?
Sit down, Will.
You know, ever since the dawn of civilization man has tried to be the stronger of the species.
The hunter, the protector.
Have you taken any anthropology classes?
Well, no, but I seen The Flintstones, like, five times.
Anyway, let me update this for you.
Say a stranger asks you for directions.
Now, you don't know where it is, but do you say that?
No.
You say, "Go down three blocks, make a left, you can't miss it.
" Yeah.
I got plenty of dudes out there still looking for places.
Same guy asks a woman.
Now, she doesn't know either.
But she says, "I don't know.
" Pfft.
That's the difference between men and women.
Wait, wait, wait, Uncle Phil.
What is it that makes men act like that?
It's testosterone, the male hormone.
And women don't have testosterone?
Well, I believe they do, but theirs is dormant most of the time.
- Excuse me.
- Wait, wait.
Uncle Phil, hold on.
You don't know the answer to none of these questions I'm asking you, do you?
No, I guess I don't.
Then why didn't you just say so?
Because I'm a man.
Hmph.
Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.
Hey, Lisa.
Shouldn't you be out fighting crime?
Listen, can I sit down?
No, Will, I don't think so.
You're too crazy for me.
No, I'm crazy about you.
There's a difference.
Look, Lisa, that's the only reason I had that guy fake sticking up the place.
Only a real robber came in.
I thought it was the setup dude.
Otherwise, I'd have been up under the table with you.
Will, what exactly were you trying to accomplish?
- Honestly?
- Yes, please tell me.
I was trying to fight Akira's dragon.
Only the dragon was from without.
Without what?
That's the same place the whole thing fell apart for me too.
Look, I think I could be cool with you being able to kick butt all over the city but I got a feeling you got some other strengths too.
And, you know, that's the part that kind of scares me.
Will, just because I'm strong, it doesn't make you weak.
- I ain't never said I was weak.
- No.
Look, why don't we just think of ourselves as being equals?
Cool.
But you know if we had the same job, I'm gonna still make more money.
Will you just shut up and kiss me?
Yes'm.
Get a room.
Y'all stay tuned for more Fresh Prince.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm trying to see how close I can get to your head without hitting it.
Uh You know, you're not doing a very good job.
The next time you throw one of those at me, I'm gonna make you eat it.
Ooh.
Oh, see, now see, now see, now you're in trouble.
- I'm in trouble?
- Uh-huh.
Now you're in trouble.
Okay.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Whoo.
If that's what happens for throwing a couple grapes at you Will, you know what I like about you?
What?
That I'm so romantic?
No, that you're so goofy.
Goofy, well Oh, you mean like in a suave, debonair, Denzel-ian kind of way, right?
No, not really.
What?
What do you mean?
I'm, what, immature?
No, no, no.
I mean that you're spontaneous and you're fun and, you know, goofy.
Why don't we just study?
Let's just get back to studying.
Fine.
Your mom goofy.
Attention, everyone.
Attention.
I have an announcement.
My horoscope said that I will prosper in my house.
So I figured I better go buy one.
Hallelujah!
Excuse me.
Hilary, that's wonderful.
Nothing fancy.
No more than six or seven bedrooms.
And I don't even care if it has a wine cellar.
For now.
How are you going to afford a house like that?
I have discovered a unique method of savings.
I never spend my own money.
By the way, Daddy, don't use your platinum card this month.
Let me get this straight.
All this time, you've been hoarding your salary while feasting away on the family fortune?
What do you say to that, big guy?
All I heard is that she's moving.
Hey, good morning, G. Good morning, Master William.
Hey, what's up, y'all?
Listen.
If you had to sum me up in, you know, like, one word how would y'all describe me?
Freeloader.
Undependable.
He's not a freeloader.
Lazy.
Of course he's lazy.
He works for me.
He's a freeloading, lazy bum.
Oh, come on.
Believe me, he's lazy.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What?
- I said one word.
Come on, y'all.
Like suave, debonair, strong.
What's this for, Will?
Well, you know, the other night, Lisa said I was kind of, you know, goofy.
Yes, that's it.
Exactly.
We're going to go with goofy, Will.
How you doing, goofy?
Shut up, Carlton.
Well, look, I don't know.
Maybe Lisa tried to give you a hint.
She calls you goofy.
Next thing you know, she's not calling you.
Yeah, right.
You think?
Will, if there's one thing I know, it's about women not calling.
- Hey.
What's up, baby?
- Hey.
- Hey, listen.
I'm off in 15 minutes.
- Oh, Will, I'm so excited.
- To hell with it.
I'm off now then.
- You're so ridiculous.
I'm excited because my friend Marvin got published in the op-ed section.
Pfft.
I mean, if I put my mind to it, I could write in any one of them old magazines.
You don't need to prove to me that you're an intellectual.
I like you just the way you are.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Oh, just forget it.
Ooh.
I cannot wait to read this.
The last article he wrote, ooh, it gave me goose bumps.
I'm gonna climb into a hot bubble bath and get started on this right now.
See you later.
A bubble bath?
"Marvin, take me away.
" I'm saying, how hard could it be to write a dumb article?
I could write a whole book.
What kind of book?
A good one.
One that real people would wanna read.
You know, with pictures and stuff.
Oh, a coloring book.
No, I'm being serious, Carlton.
How hard could it be to write good?
- Well.
- Well, what?
Never mind.
Oh, sorry.
- Hey, Carlton, thanks for coming along.
- No problem.
The sooner you make money, you're out of the house and ultimately out of my life.
Hey, man, what do you think of this title for my book?
I'm gonna call it Celebrities' Houses At Night.
I may have misjudged you, Will.
You really are pulling out all the stops for this girl.
Look at you.
Your hair's neat, your nails are trimmed.
You started flossing again.
Hey, man, look, I even trim my nose hair.
Check it out.
- Nice job.
- Thanks.
I don't know.
It's just wild, man.
You know, it's like Lisa's the first thought in my mind when I wake up in the morning.
The last thought before I go to sleep.
Man, you know, I can talk to her about anything.
You know, it's like her face has just been engraved inside my head.
It's like, say I'm having a bad day.
No matter what it is, just terrible.
It's like, that first second that I see her beautiful face and she puts her arms around me I touch her lips it's like, just everything is better.
Everything.
You know what I'm saying, Carlton?
I sure do.
Give me a hug, big guy.
Carlton!
- Carlton, what is wrong with you, man?
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just got caught up in the moment.
Why don't you get caught up in keeping your eyes on the road?
All right, okay.
Look, just take a picture of Bob Barker's house.
Oh, man.
Look like Bob up in there getting his freak on.
Bobby, come on down.
All right, all right.
Check it out.
Listen.
I even got a title.
It's called Celebrities' Houses At Night.
I'm not sure.
You're right.
Look at this picture.
How about this one?
Look at Richard Simmons in his back yard cooking them big old stank sausages.
Oh, man, that one is gold.
Look, kid, I gotta tell you, this picture doesn't really do it for me.
- I mean, look at it, it's too dark.
- Oh, see, you're not open.
You're not open, man.
I'm telling you.
It's Celebrities' Houses At Night.
Okay, look, look.
Kid, you got a nice idea here with the house thing.
It's just not something I can get behind, all right?
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
See, because you're not letting your cerebellum rotate.
Listen.
Look at this.
It's not just pictures.
I wrote little stories with them too.
Bam!
You didn't notice that one.
See, it's different now.
See, because I'm not just a photographer.
I'm a photographer and a writer.
I'm ambidextrous.
Nice try, huh?
Maybe next time.
Well, fine.
Maybe I am goofy.
Hey, don't forget your pictures here.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
- Is this one Jay Leno?
- Yeah, that's him.
What is he doing here?
He was pouring some coffee in the sewer or something.
- I don't know, what does my story say?
- I could use this in one of my publications.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, America loves Jay Leno.
So, what, it'd be more like an article?
Yeah, that's right.
But I still get credit and everything, right?
That and $500.
Here, here, here.
I want you to read this release form.
Sign it when you're ready.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hey, looks good to me, man.
Will?
Will?
WILL : Good evening, you fine Nubian princess.
I set up a little surprise for you tonight, so just follow instructions and enjoy.
Number one: Clap twice.
Number two: I've got a succulent lobster dinner prepared.
So go to the microwave, press start.
Number three: Take your sexy little self on over to the couch and have a seat.
Number four: Get naked.
What?
No, my fault.
I was just kidding.
I was just kidding.
All right.
Number five: Turn around.
Ooh.
You sure do know how to make a girl feel special.
Will, what is all of this about?
We are celebrating, baby.
I've been published.
Published?
When did you start writing?
Last week.
Hey, look.
I wanna give you some goose bumps too.
Mm.
Okay, so where's the article?
- Let me see it.
- Eh, eh, eh.
In due time.
- In due time.
It's all a surprise, baby.
- Okay.
Hoo.
Lisa.
Sweetheart, there's only one word to describe you.
Scum.
Carlton.
Man, you know the routine.
When there's a sock in the door, you sleep on the lawn.
Have you read this week's National Inquisitor?
Man, I don't read that trash.
Then how come you're writing it?
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
They used one of my photos from my book and put it in here.
"'Jay Leno: Earth Enemy Number One' by Will Smith"?
You sold pictures to a sleazy magazine like this?
No, no, no, baby.
I did not.
I sold them to a book publisher.
Look, Jay Leno wasn't holding an oil can.
He was holding a coffee pot.
That guy tricked me.
Well, at least I got paid.
- Master William, you have a visitor.
- Will Smith?
- Yes, sir.
- You're served.
What?
What's wrong, baby?
Jay Leno is suing me for $10 million.
How do you go from trying to make a little impression on Lisa to being sued by Jay Leno for $10 million?
Um I'm goofy?
But wait, wait.
I'm the victim here.
That publisher took my pictures and used them for evil instead of good.
I mean, he like Hugh Hefner.
And I'm an innocent young girl from the Midwest.
And you expect me to clean up this mess.
Well, yeah.
You know the routine.
I do something stupid, you clean it all up.
The only difference is this time, I didn't do nothing.
I think you've taken troublemaking to a whole new plateau.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
You gotta know somebody down there.
A cameraman, a makeup girl.
Maybe you sentenced one of the guys in the band or something.
There is a bigger issue involved here.
I can't keep pulling your butt out of the fire.
You're right.
You're right, Uncle Phil.
Look And this is the last two or few times.
I promise.
You know, Will, there comes a time Oh, not the "there comes a time" speech.
I'd pay $10 million to not have to hear that again.
I'd pay $10 million so I didn't have to say it again.
Fine.
If you don't wanna help me, just say that.
I got myself into this mess, I'll get myself out.
I don't need nobody.
Why don't I watch you handle this one, I'll get the next one, all right?
I can't believe that that realtor wasted my time on that dump.
That house was gorgeous.
What's the problem?
Problem?
Well, for starters, the layout.
Say I'm having a small garden party for 50 of my closest friends and someone spills cocktail sauce on their Armani suit.
My maid Hildegard would have to go through the gazebo into the living room past the library and up the steps to get to the laundry room.
Hilary, that's ridiculous.
You're right.
Who cares how far Hildegard has to walk?
Is there anything I can do to help?
Can you drive a getaway car?
Master William, come quickly.
- They're talking about you on the telly.
PEOPLE : Save our sewers.
- Save our sewers.
Save our sewers.
- This is Andrea White of KFPB.
It has been reported to the National Inquisitor that Tonight Show host Jay Leno is a toxic polluter.
Will Smith is the young man who photographed Leno dumping oil into the sewer systems.
His story also alleges that Mr. Leno may be single-handedly responsible for destroying the rain forest, the ozone layer and the one tree that grows in Brooklyn.
Oh, that poor little tree.
Forget that tree, Ashley.
Come on, I'm getting railroaded.
Well, I finally contacted Leno's lawyer.
- Yeah?
What'd he say?
- Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't look good.
I'm afraid you're liable.
What is so funny?
You're liable for libel.
Get it?
Those are homonyms.
Carlton, your next crack is gonna be in your head.
Try it and I'll sue.
Well I know what I gotta do.
He's not gonna do anything stupid, is he?
You don't know him very well, do you?
It's The Tonight Show.
I'm doing the Bill Clinton McDonald's bit.
It's my best joke.
You're my agent.
I'm the one who should be nervous.
I'll call you after the show, okay?
Yeah.
Bye.
Hey, bro.
How you doing?
Have you seen Jay Leno?
No, and I probably won't until I'm on stage.
- I'm John Ridley.
I'm the comedian.
- Oh.
So you're John Ridley.
Yeah.
Oh, well, these are for you.
They're from Mr. Leno.
Oh, thanks.
Listen, John.
How long have you been a standup?
About 10 years.
Why?
I just hate this part of my job.
What part?
Dude, you've been bumped.
Bumped?
Listen.
One of Roseanne's other personalities showed up.
We have to let her keep talking.
You gotta be kidding.
My family in Milwaukee will be watching.
- I got a killer opening.
- That's show biz.
Come on.
No, wait a minute, I got this great joke about how I'm so pro-black I won't even pick the cotton out of a bottle of aspirin.
I think I did you a favor, bro.
Come on.
But my family is gonna - Security.
- Wait  Welcome back.
My next guest is a young comedian making his first appearance on The Tonight Show.
Please give a warm welcome to a very funny young man, Mr. John Ridley.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
Well, you know, the other day, I just had this bottle of aspirin, you know.
But I couldn't take it because I'm black.
What I mean is, you know, the bottle had cotton in it, you know.
Get it?
Cotton.
I'm black.
Well, well, actually, you know, what I mean is Um  Hey, wait a minute, wait.
This isn't John.
Security!
Hey, Jay.
You got to listen to me.
I'm the guy you're suing, Will Smith.
The guy that's been putting the stuff in the paper?
- That's me.
- There's been a lot written about me.
A lot of it untrue.
And this seems to be the gentleman respon Come over here.
Let's settle it right now.
You got two minutes to explain yourself.
- Hey.
- All right, tell us what's going on.
Jay, listen.
I was just trying to impress my girlfriend, Lisa.
I like her a lot.
I wanted to prove to her that I wasn't, you know, goofy.
You, goofy?
I can't imagine how she got that idea.
- What are you talking about?
- Me neither, man.
I was putting together this book.
It's called celebrities' houses at night.
- Good concept, right?
- Terrific idea.
You know, what happened was, you know, I just wanted to show Lisa that I was special, you know?
Because I just really don't wanna lose her because I really like her.
And, well, the pictures I gave them to the guy, he was supposed to put out my book.
He put it in the national inquisitor.
I never meant for anything bad to happen.
The pictures weren't for that.
Listen, America, I just want you to know it was not oil, it was coffee.
- Jay was pouring coffee out.
It wasn't oil.
- Right.
Well, thank you, Smith, for clearing that up.
I appreciate that.
Well, you know, my friends call me Will.
Thanks a lot, Smith.
I really appreciate that.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Actually, that's kind of romantic, I think, though.
I think I mean, what you You are goofy, and you are an idiot.
That's beside the point.
It's kind of a romantic thing.
And maybe we should drop the suit.
What do you think, audience?
- All right, Will.
- Okay.
You're off the hook.
- Thanks a lot, Jay.
- All right, all right.
Hey, who's our next guest?
That's it.
Join us tomorrow when our guests will be Kevin Costner, Wilt Chamberlain and we'll see if we can find the real John Ridley.
See you later, bye-bye.
Thanks for watching.
- Wow, Will, were you nervous?
- No, no, not really.
I'm just glad that whole mess is over.
I'm sorry I started the whole thing but you looked good on The Tonight Show.
You were really wacky.
I'm saying What do you mean by "wacky"?
No, he's not wacky.
No.
She did not mean that.
No, I mean, you're an irresponsible lazy bum, but you're not

Well, I mean there are just so many more interesting ways to say it.

His corpulent flesh rolls around his bones like a thick chocolate pudding.
Huh?
Or scientific.
He is so huge that food comes to him from the gravitational pull alone.
Huh?
Ha-ha-ha.
Or you could be quizzical.
Is that your head or is your neck blowing a bubble?
You could be ribald, ironic, vaudevillian, whatever.
But be creative.
You got that?

Now, if ever there were a lifetime commitment Seven a. m. tomorrow.
Okay, in the morning.
- Uh Um Uh - Seven a. m.  Should've given Hilary the paddle.

A little exercise can't hurt.
- Tomorrow.
- Okay.
Tonight we eat fudge.
Hey, hey, you could kill somebody.
- Hi, Will.
- Hey, Lisa, what's up, baby?
Hey, look if you wanna go out tonight, baby, it cannot happen.

That's okay.
I'm helping Dana set up a new apartment.
I wanted to stop by and bring you your jacket.
Oh, thank you.
- Hi.
Oh, Dana.
Dana, this is Will.

Cool.
It's, uh, right down the hall, on the right.
- Knock yourself out.
Thanks.
Please.
Heh, heh.
Who was that?
That's Dana.
What's wrong with you?
The Dana I was expecting would be sitting down on the toilet not standing up in front of it.
Will, he's just a friend.
Oh, oh, just a friend.
Well, just how friendly is this friend?
Will, don't define everything.
Let things flow naturally, right?
Where did you hear that crock of garbage?
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

You nasty boy.
Oh, how did you know?

Actually, you know, I was kind of surprised that you called me.
Rumor had it that you were off the market.
Oh, well, you know, I'm still hearing offers.
Heh.
You can, uh, think of tonight as an open house.
Mm.
Gee, your hair smells terrific.
Come here, you.
Oh, dear God!
What is it?
Are you okay?
Uh No, no I was just I was just thinking about how they made Tom Cruise even whiter.
Heh.
You see, I told you about those scary movies.
You need to relax.
Why don't you let me help you, uh, relieve some of that tension?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, don't!
- Will.

- Mm?
Oh, Will.
- I thought you were that Susan Powter.
- Oh.
- Yeah, well, we got the same barber.
- Uh, yeah.
What's the matter, son?
You seem down.
Well, something happened last night got me a little worried.
I was in the pool house.
- Oh, man, with this real, real fly honey, man.
- Mm-hm.
All systems were go and then they kind of went.
Don't worry about that, son.
Happens to the best of us.
And as you get older, it might even seem commonplace.
I mean, I didn't wanna do it.
I couldn't get Lisa off my mind.
Well, Will, obviously, you're thinking of Lisa differently.
One might even venture to say that you're falling in Da, da, da Don't go there.
Don't go there.
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, yeah.
No, no, I was just thinking about her, that's all.
Mm, I see.
But, you know, just hypothetically, you know You know, if I was falling You know How would I know?
When I was going with your Aunt Vivian, I had a lot of nervous energy.
Ha, ha.
I used to get up every morning at dawn and run through the park.
You used to jog?
That was a shortcut to the diner where she worked.
The one sure way that I could tell that I was in love was that You know those stupid, sappy love songs I used to make fun of, you know?
Well, they started making sense.
I mean, this one really did it for me.
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day When it's cold outside I've got the month of May I guess you'll say What can make me feel this way?
My girl Talkin' 'bout -  All right, stop, Uncle Phil, stop.
- Oh.
Don't be ridiculous, Susan.
The whole family would love to go on a 10-mile jog.
Hold on.
I smell pepperoni on the premises.
You're busted, big guy.
I'll just go eat some celery.
Will, I am so surprised at you.
Standing around here watching your uncle dig himself into an early grave.
Yeah, you filthy stinking enabler.
Hey, look, wait a minute, I got other things on my mind right now.
I ain't got no time for buns of brass and brains of bricks.
He needs help.
You wouldn't talk that way if you walked just one mile in your uncle's shoes.
My uncle can't walk one mile in my uncle's shoes.
Listen, why don't you go haunt one of your big-boned friends?
Big-boned?
Okay, I'm gonna show you big-boned.
Looks like Lorena Bobbitt got to this suit, huh?
Let's just call this part of your family education kit because you know why?
In every group, there's always an insensitive boob.
We must be lucky, we got two.
Ha, ha.
This dumb suit ain't gonna prove nothing.
I could wear this thing for a week.
Oh, really?
Why don't you just go out for one day?
Go out in public and see what it feels like to look like this.
Go ahead.
Pbbt.
Look, this thing will be a breeze.
Lady I'm your knight in shining armor And I love you You have made me what I am And I am yours Will, are you all right?
- Yeah, why?
- You were just singing "Lady" to a melon.
Oh, that's how I check them for ripeness.
Will, you've been acting really weird.
That's funny?
Y'all think that's funny?
You think that's funny, huh?
Whoo.
You ain't had no home training, that's what your problem is.
Whoo.
Potato chips?
What about Susan Powter?
Listen, I'm as health conscious as the next person but when she threw out the strawberry Pop-Tarts, she crossed the line.
Which reminds me, I'll be right back.
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm retaining water.
Well, well, look who's here, Lisa and friend.
Oh, we need paper towels and a can opener.
Is that fat guy following us?
What fat guy?
Come on.
Excuse me, is there some reason why you're following us?
- Will?
- Well, it ain't Fat Albert.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
What are?
Oh.
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
I don't believe you, girl.
I thought we had something real.
Here I am singing stupid love songs about you and thinking about you all the time.
Writing your name on every book I own.
And you stepping out on me in a grocery store.
You know how ridiculous that makes me look?
Huh?
Do you?
Will, for the umpteenth time, I told you, Dana and I are just friends.
Oh, oh.
Well, let me tell you about your slimy little friend.
He's just trying to gain your confidence, so he'll know when you're most vulnerable.
And that's when he's gonna pounce on you like a cheetah on a rabbit.
And you believe that?
Believe it?
I've done it.
- Hey, man, you've got me all wrong.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Look here, dude this is between moi and her.
We don't need you.
I'm out of here, Lis.
- You just hold on a second.
- What?
Hold on what?
If you are gonna have a relationship with me you are gonna have to trust me.
The same way that I trust you not to date anybody else.
Oh, yeah, well, I did date somebody else.
- Oh, you did?
- Yes, I did, last night.
One of my friends.
She was ready and willing to do anything I wanted to do.
Except we couldn't do what I wanted to do.
All I wanted to do was be with you.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.
- And do you know why?
- No, why?
Because I love you.
What did you just say?
I said I love you.
Baby.
So let's just say I wanted to do an exercise tape.
That would bring me, what, 10 million?
Though, I wouldn't actually have to touch fat people, would I?
Could they just be electronically morphed in later?
Philip, as much as I'd like to hang around and help you reach your ideal weight, I can't.
I gotta go, because I can't stand being around you.
Ooh, you have such a grating personality.
That's my boy.
Ha-ha-ha.
Come on, everyone, tuna melts on me.
Come on.
- Hey, what's up, G?
- Hey, Master William.
Guess what, Geoffrey.
We saw Lisa at the grocery store and Will used the L-word.
"Leather"?
No, "love.
" Tomato, tomato.
That's right.
I'm telling you, I made the leap, man.
First time in my life, I'm a one-woman man.
Well, you know what you have to do?
Repeat after me.
Repeat after me.
Sorry.
I accept this gift and all the responsibilities it carries.
I accept this gift and all the responsibilities it carries.
- I'll never betray it.
- I'll never betray it.
- I'll never abandon it.
- I'll never abandon it.
I will never reveal the secrets which it contains.
I will never reveal the secrets which it contains.
Hold out your hands.
Carlton I give you my chicktionary.
May it be as good to you as it has been to me.
I can feel it.
I can feel the power!
Yes!
Yes!
Y'all stay tuned for more Fresh Prince.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I'm in middle of a holiday shopping season.
Are you mad?
I simply said I was considering it.
He's here plenty.
You can't do this.
Money, we need money.
You know we can afford this.
You're the one who helped me invest.
My money makes money.
We're rich.
- That's right, we are rich.
- Never thought about it like that.
Cool.
If we're so rich why we can't afford no ceiling?
- Hi, Mr. Banks.
Hi, kids.
Stop worrying, go to work, I'll handle your father.
You don't know my father.
He's very overprotective.
Last time one of my boyfriends spent an evening with him it ended our relationship.
So, what?
You never saw the guy again?
No, no one did.
He left town.
At least that's what my dad told the police.
I think you're exaggerating a little bit.
Okay, maybe a little.
But, just in case it's been really nice knowing you.
Go on, girl, get out of here.
Hiyah!
- Bye, Mr. Banks.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
So you're meeting Lisa's father tonight.
I remember the first time I met Vivian's father.
He was an obstinate, dictatorial old tightwad.
We didn't get along at all.
Really?
Even with all that in common?
I'm serious, Will.
Wasn't till the day he died that he did something to improve the situation.
- Really?
What did he do?
- He died.
But the point is, first impressions can last forever.
You be careful tonight.
Don't worry about me, I'll be myself.
Let the charm take care of it for me.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Your charm is kind of an acquired taste.
Like liver.
- You hate liver.
- Exactly.
So, what?
What, are you saying I shouldn't be myself?
Let me just leave you alone with your thoughts.
So that's still a possibility?
- A very strong one, honey.
We have to do something about Dad.
I've tried, but he likes that shirt.
I mean we have to discourage this whole early retirement thing.
You were all for it.
I was, but I've been thinking, if Dad has more time I'm the one he'll be spending it with.
His favorite what?
His favorite child, his little girl.
I thought it was obvious.
Well, think again, little sister.
You are not Dad's favorite.
That's right, Ashley, I am.
You?
Hey, it's a known fact that the oldest is always the favorite.
- Mom and Dad got it right the first time.
- Then why did they keep trying?
Well, you're both wrong.
It's me.
I make him money.
And Daddy's little girl doesn't mean beans next to a chip off the old block which is me.
- And Nicky.
Nicky's only been around a few years, Daddy hardly knows him.
It's me.
A simple way to find out.
Dad's will.
Whoever gets the most wins.
That's ridiculous.
More money doesn't mean more love.
We're all his children, right?
Don't know, I'm starting to think you were adopted.
Let's find that will.
Hey, listen, Mr. Wilkes, I want you to order anything that you want.
Price is no object.
Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first six times.
Oh.
You know, they're known for their lemon soup.
Sir, that's a finger bowl.
Oh, my fault, my fault.
Excellent.
I don't know about this place.
See, I'm more of a pizza guy.
Oh, well, they got pizza.
What do you want on it?
What, a tandoori duck?
Grilled pheasant?
For 24 bucks, I want a 20-dollar bill on it.
He said That is so It was fu So Lisa says you're an automotive technician.
No, I'm not.
I fix cars.
I manage a garage.
A garage.
Wow, that is so interesting.
No, it's not.
It's a job.
Hey, but I like working with my hands.
It gives me the feeling I'm earning my money instead of having it just handed to me.
I know the feeling.
No, you don't.
Look, Will, Lisa may like you but personally, I think you're a bourgie little toad.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I'll catch a bus back to Lisa's.
Don't leave.
This is This is not the real me.
This is Carlton.
Why you putting on airs, boy?
Look, please?
I like your daughter more than any other girl that I've ever been with.
And believe me, I've been with Out of girlfriend for a long time.
Listen, I just wanted to make a good impression on you.
Well, look, as long as we're being honest with each other I wasn't going to like you no matter how you acted.
Oh, why not?
Ever since the good Lord took my Yvonne my life's been pretty empty, Will, except for Lisa.
I'm a little overprotective.
Really?
The real Will Smith ain't bourgie.
I'm telling you, he's a low-class working stiff like yourself.
Even lower.
Hoo!
Hey, I tell you what, Will.
Why don't we get out of this joint and introduce me to the real Will Smith?
Sounds good to me.
Say, baby, you seen the real Will Smith?
Where did you learn to do this?
The Young Republicans sponsored a seminar.
Open sesame.
It's full of gold bars.
Those are Twinkies.
- Hello, legal docs.
- Oh, yes.
I see someone's coming into money.
We weren't taking any money.
I meant me.
All right, Geoffrey, what will it cost to keep you quiet?
Considering the magnitude of this betrayal of your father's trust I'd say a thousand dollars.
Well, that's cool, we can handle that.
No problem.
A week.
If you'll excuse me, I have to wash some dirty laundry.
He has no scruples.
Shut up and close the safe.
Oh, baby.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- How was the game?
- Oh, girl, it was the bomb.
Check out this here fly jacket your daddy got me.
How come?
My little way of saying thanks for such a wonderful visit.
I got one for you too, baby.
Oh, just what I wanted.
Hey, I better go check on my flight time.
Ah!
No.
Not that I mind, but what was that for?
Hm.
Because you've been so nice to my dad.
You spent more time with him than I have.
Oh, well, trust me, I am exhausted.
Hey, let me tell you.
Your father followed me on my jog today, then he showed up in my lit class.
Last thing I ever waan to do again is see a naked middle-aged man in the shower.
I'll tell you that now.
Let me tell you.
Your dad is a great guy, but I'm kind of happy he's leaving.
Tell me about it.
I love when he comes to visit but we haven't spent any time alone in a whole week.
Well, I think I can remedy that situation.
There's a 747 with his name written all over it.
Soon as we get him to the airport we can get back to my crib for a little one-on-one.
You know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Well, my flight's on time.
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Take care of my little girl.
- You got that.
- It was so good to see you again.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you know what?
Too bad you got to leave.
- You mean that?
- We had a ball.
It's a shame you can't stay longer.
If that's the way you feel, O.K. Okay what?
I'll stay.
Stay where?
I'll stay with you for another week, maybe two.
Man, the way things are going, I might stay forever.
You cannot be serious about moving out here.
I'm saying, won't you miss Cleveland?
You've never been there, have you?
Besides, this city makes me feel alive.
And my little girl is here, and you, Will.
Man, you're like the son I never had.
Uh, Daddy, remember Craig?
Craig's too busy with his marriage and two kids.
He has no time for his old man.
What do you say we celebrate with a nice dinner tonight, huh?
My treat.
Well, I kind of have plans for tonight.
Oh, what about you, Will?
- Oh, I'd love to, you know - Then great, pick me up at 7.
I'm going to take a nice nap, so I'll be rested up for my big night with Will.
Hey.
I'll see you later.
Whoo.
Your brother's not busy, he's hiding.
Will, this is your fault.
You are just too damn lovable.
Oh, well, there's a character flaw.
You have to do something, otherwise we'll end up spending the rest of our lives playing one-on-one-on-one.
Maybe Daddy's password is some kind of food.
Look, I tried every dish in Geoffrey's cookbook, nothing works.
Unbelievable.
What kind of idiot picks a password no one can guess?
See, it's that kind of question that knocks you out of the running for Dad's favorite.
Just keep a lookout.
I told you this whole idea was stupid.
Can you put disk back in the safe before Dad catches us?
Too late.
Do you even know what the word "lookout" means?
Daddy, I am so sorry.
Let's settle this right now.
Look, big guy Sir we just wanted to see what was in your will.
I knew it.
Never should've let you play with those Menendez boys.
Daddy, we just wanted to know who your favorite child was.
I can't believe you would even ask.
See, it is me.
Right now, it's hard to love any one of you, but I do.
Ashley, I love your sensitivity, your warmth.
Carlton, I love your ambition and your persistence.
Hilary.
- Hilary.
- Yes, Daddy?
- Nice earrings.
- Oh, Daddy.
I love Nicky's innocence and his enthusiasm.
I love you all differently, but equally.
Do you understand?
Daddy, that was beautiful.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Okay, they're gone now.
69 BOYZ : Tootsee Roll, Tootsee Roll  Whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Hey, what's up, brother?
How are you doing, man?
Good to see you, boy.
Will.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Will, I'm a little uncomfortable in here.
What would my pastor say if he saw me in this place?
Probably say, "Hey, Fred, you got change for a 20"?
Welcome to Caufield's, gentlemen, follow me.
I got a little somethin'- somethin' for you, girl.
Ooh!
Whoo.
Pick your tongue up, Fred, the floor's dirty.
Ha, ha.
Ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh!
Will, how often do you come here?
Oh, hardly ever.
Two, three times a day.
I don't know what to say.
No, don't say nothing, lay back, cool out, get your groove on.
You know what I'm saying?
Ooh-ooh!
Whoo!
Hey, shake it, but don't break it.
Ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh!
Excuse me, Reverend Fred, it's nice to see you coming out of your shell.
Will, I was wrong, man, this is just good clean fun.
These girls are trying to earn a dollar like me except I work with my hands and they work with everything else.
Well, come up on the stage, man.
Ooh-ooh!
JANET : Nasty, nasty boys Don't ever change Oh, Lisa, Lisa, baby.
Girl, it is so good to finally see you without Will!
Hey, Willie.
Tonight's the big game, man.
Browns versus Philly.
Heh, heh.
Daddy, tonight Will is taking me out.
Oh, okay.
Hold up a second there, Fred.
Lisa, I'm breaking our date tonight.
Excuse me?
Did it ever occur to you I might wanna see this game more than I wanna see you?
I was looking forward to our date tonight.
Look, look, here, woman, okay?
I'm the man, and as the man, I said I'm gonna see the game.
How dare you disrespect me in front of my father.
Wait a minute, now, this is between you kids.
That's right, Lisa.
Whether you like it or not, I'm going.
You know what?
Blow our date off tonight you can forget about us.
- Ooh, ooh.
- Well, maybe I just will forget then.
Hey.
Now, wait a minute.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Maybe you should do something.
- You're damn right I should.
Shame on you.
Don't you see how important this game is?
How can you be so unreasonable?
I raised you better.
- You really disappoint me, young lady.
You really disappoint me.
See you later, buddy.
You know what?
That's it, I can't take this no longer.
- I got to do it tonight.
- Do what?
Break up with your father.
- Good, game hasn't started.
- All right.
Hey, grab us some grub.
- See you in a sec.
- Okay.
All right.
- Hey.
- Hey, Will.
Man, I was starting to get worried.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing, nothing, everything's fine.
No, it's not.
I can see it in your eyes.
There's something you're not telling me.
You're right, Fred.
I can't go on pretending anymore.
This just isn't working out.
What do you mean?
You, me, us, this whole thing.
It was great in the beginning but I just think we need to stop seeing so much of each other.
Will, is it something I did?
- Will, I can change.
- No, no.
No, it's not you, Fred.
It's me.
It's me.
I haven't been straight up with you.
There's someone else.
Oh, who is he?
He's right over there.
He taught me everything I know about sports.
- He's generous.
He's caring.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he's a great guy.
I guess I should be grateful for you at least being honest with me.
- Maybe I should give you this back.
- No, no, I want you to keep it.
To remember the game.
I will, Fred.
Well, it's been fun.
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's definitely been fun.
Hey, you be well.
You too, Will.
Can I call you?
I don't think that would be such a good idea.
Well, at least, not right at first.
You're a very lucky man.
I talked to my dad today.
No, he's staying in Cleveland, don't worry.
He's been spending a lot of time with my brother.
Didn't take him long to forget about me, huh?
He did not forget about you.
As a matter of fact, he wanted me to give you a message.
I'm not sure I understand it.
What?
Same game, next season.
Oh, yeah, tell him it's on.
Oh, look.
There's a shooting star.
Make a wish.
Don't need to.
You already came true.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hilary, what are you doing?
I'm putting tags on everything I'm taking with me.
Taking with you where?
Oh, didn't I tell you?
The other day when I went out to buy that sweater I bought a house to match.
Ha, ha.
- Sweetheart, that's unbelievable.
- Ha, ha.
Do I know how to accessorize or what?
- You can't take all that stuff with you.
- The hell she can't.
Thanks, Daddy.
Were you or were you not supposed to be there at 11 p. m. sharp?
I told you I had to drop Lisa off.
Besides, I was there at 11:30.
Right.
For 30 treacherous minutes I stood alone at the corner of Rexford and Olympic.
Carlton, that's Beverly Hills.
Yeah, the bad part.
90211.
You know, Will, lately you've been completely unreliable.
I just hope you don't disappoint me this weekend.
This weekend?
Oh.
Oh, yeah, this weekend, yeah.
Yeah.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Yeah, yes I do.
This weekend.
You know, Saturday and Sunday.
How you constantly disappoint me.
What do we always do the first weekend after the new year?
Your annual height check?
After that.
This weekend is our yearly bros-in-the-snow getaway.
Come on, Will.
We've gone on these trips the last four years running.
I live for this weekend.
Okay, Carlton, I am sorry.
I forgot.
All right?
I'll go.
Just go upstairs and wax your skis or your legs or whatever you wax.
All right, I'll forgive you this time.
Oh, this is going to be grand.
Ha-ha-ha.
Asking Miss Lisa for permission?
First of all, Benson, I ain't gotta ask nobody for permission.
Hey, Lisa.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Uh Listen, babe, um, about our date this weekend Oh, Will, you know what, I just found out that I have to work.
Oh, darn.
Uh, I guess I'll just have to go on an annual ski weekend to Mammoth with Carlton.
Well, good, because when you're not busy, you know you get yourself into trouble.
All right, baby.
It's a shame you can't come with us.
Yeah, I wish I could.
Well, wear your long johns.
Yes, dear.
Hey, I love you, baby.
I love you, too.
- All right.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
That was a pretty nasty fall you took there, Will.
Fall?
Pfft.
No, you must have been watching one of the other black skiers.
Oh, these weekends really get my adrenalin pumping.
How about some hot cocoa?
Yeah, make mine a double.
Two cocoas please.
One grande.
Will, you remember when we first started coming up here?
Uh Yeah, it was a weekend, wasn't it?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I remember now.
This place is always fly, man.
Wait till you see what I got planned for the rest of the evening.
After we power down our cocoas, there's a complimentary luge lesson.
Followed by supper at 7, then back to the room for some hot spiced cider and a Barbara Walters Special.
Normally, I would ditch you on that last one but, uh, I'm gonna let you in on a little something.
Ever since I was like 7, I had a mad crush on Barbara Walters.
I thought I was the only one.
How do you feel about Nancy Reagan?
Oh, see now you're being just sick.
Hi.
Nice parka.
Down?
Uh, no, it's a poly blend.
Mine's alpaca.
I'm Angie Cobb.
Look, Miss Cobb, I know what you're up to and I'm not interested.
You have eyes, take a look, I'm with him.
This is our special weekend.
Oh.
Well, good for you.
Good for the both of you.
Ha, ha.
Wait a minute, baby.
I don't even know this guy.
Geoffrey, admit it.
- You're going to miss me, aren't you?
- Oh, yes, Miss Hilary.
In fact, I'm going to go upstairs right now and have myself a good cry.
Wow, he's even more upset about my leaving than I thought.
I hope he doesn't hurt himself.
I can't believe it.
My big sister's moving out.
Oh, Ashley, mi casa es your casa.
You can come over any time you want.
Except for Tuesdays when I shoot three shows and I really need my space.
Oh, and Thursdays.
I shop till about 9 and then I take a warm bath and read.
Why don't you come over on Mondays between 11:15 and 2:30?
Hilary, I'm in school.
Well, if you can't find the time Another cocoa, Will?
Oh, no, I'm gonna have to pass, C. I drink another cocoa, I mess around, I have to let out a Hershey bar.
This is what life's all about.
I mean, look around us.
Is this not the best?
Two guys together, beautiful surroundings, white snow, fresh air.
God, look at those mountains.
The hills are alive.
You know, we should get away more often.
- Me and you, you and - Lisa.
Not Lisa.
No offense, I know she's your girlfriend, but - Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- My boss didn't need me.
So it was either stay home and study or come up here and be with my baby.
Aw.
Break it down one time.
Ahh.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, Carlton.
- Nice to see you again, Lisa.
Uh, Will, I'm gonna go to the car and get my stuff.
I'm so happy you invited me.
You invited her?
Well, yeah.
Well, kind of.
Come on, Carlton, now, this does not mean that we can't still have a good time.
Smile.
Smile.
- You can do it.
- No.
Look, this was supposed to be our special weekend.
I don't wanna share you with some woman.
Listen, Carlton, just because Lisa's here, that don't mean we can't have fun, man.
Listen, hey, we are gonna do every single thing that you have scheduled.
- Promise?
- Yes, sir.
- We'll go luging?
- Absolutely.
- We'll go to the restaurant I picked?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- What about Barbara Walters?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Carlton, come on, man, ain't nothing changed.
We are inseparable.
Oh.
What's up, baby?
- Hey.
Listen, why don't you go down and check out some of the shops?
Uh, unless you wanna hang out with a couple lugers.
Will, it was such a cold and lonely drive up here I just wanna go upstairs and get into a nice hot bubble bath.
- You do know how to pour bubbles, right?
- Mm.
Um, hold that thought.
- Carlton - Oh, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
- Oh, I'm out of here.
- Carlton.
Where are you go?
Carlton, come on, man.
What is wrong with him?
Um, nothing.
Uh, baby, listen, why don't you go ahead upstairs get the tub started, let Calgon take you halfway, and I'll come take you the rest.
Carlton, wait.
- Carlton.
- Get out of my car.
Carlton, this is not your car.
Then get out of my rental car.
- No.
- Fine.
Look, Carlton, come on.
Now I'll never get to see that Barbara Walters Special.
And she had Henry Winkler too.
Carlton, listen, man.
You made me miss Fonzie.
- Carlton, look.
- No, you look.
No, slow up, deer.
Don't you try to sweet-talk me, Will.
No, Carlton, in the road, a deer!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, I don't believe this.
I know, these air bags are worthless.
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I swear, God as my witness I will be in church first thing Sunday morning.
Oh, wait, Sunday's bad.
Oh.
Okay, I'll cancel, I'll cancel.
Your whole life does flash before your eyes.
Which reminds me, you still owe me You want your 20 bucks?
Okay, here it is.
Now, go get it, you little car flipper.
What are you doing?
Making a mental note of where it is in case we get out of here, which we won't.
- What are you talking about?
- It's a 40-foot drop to that slope.
Well, we ain't going that way.
I'm climbing back up to the road.
Will, that's sheer ice.
Happen not gonna.
Back in Philly, they used to call me Spider-Man.
That was just one of my nicknames.
So this is it.
This is how the Carlton Banks story ends.
With a whimper.
Shut up, Carlton.
Help!
Echo!
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho.
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hey.
Hi-de-hi-de-Heidi-Fleiss.
Daddy, isn't it great about Hilary?
When do you think I'll get to move out?
Oh.
Sweetheart, you know expressions like "when hell freezes over"?
"When the cows come home"?
"When donkeys fly"?
Pick one.
It's too dark to signal with that mirror, Will, you might as well put it down.
I've been trying to for, like, a half hour.
Will, I want you to eat me.
If I die first.
You can stay alive by using my body for nourishment.
Incidentally, the buttocks has the most meat.
God, I hope I go first.
Ouch.
God, man, my fingers are getting all numb.
That's how it starts.
First numbness, then the sensation of needles on skin finally, right before death, violent spasms as your blood freezes and your heart locks up.
No more Discovery Channel for you, man.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- What Carlton, what?
What?
- No, no, no!
What, Carlton, violent spasms?
Tell me what to do.
I didn't get the insurance.
- What?
- I put the car on my credit card and I didn't get the $6 insurance.
You always wonder why they ask you to sign that waiver.
Well, there it is.
I don't know what's worse.
Dying a slow agonizing death or staying alive and listening to you.
Damn, it's cold.
You know, Will?
I don't have any friends.
What are you talking about, Carlton?
You got plenty of friends, man.
You think people are your friends but they're only that because of what you can do for them.
Except you, Will.
I don't do anything for you.
Even when you make fun of me I know you're doing it out of love.
You haven't been doing that as much lately.
What are you talking about, Carlton?
I just called you Thumbelina this morning.
Yeah, but your heart wasn't in it.
Look, Carlton let me tell you something, man.
Lisa, that's my girlfriend and we're gonna be together, man.
But that doesn't change the fact that you're my best friend.
Stumpy.
I'd cry, but my tear ducts are frozen.
You know what?
I ain't going out like this.
All right, look, I figure if I can hit this slope at the perfect angle I could ski down and get us some help.
Look, Will, I'm a much better skier than you.
- Let me go.
- Go ahead.
You'd let me jump like that?
Hey, hey, hey, who better to risk his life for me than my best friend, huh?
Huh?
Wait, Carlton.
I think I see somebody down there.
We're saved.
Hello, up here!
I think he sees us.
What?
What did he say?
I think he said, "Don't yell.
" Don't yell?
Why not?
Avalanche!
- You don't think anything bad happened?
- I'm sure they'll be back any second.
What was that?
Hey, you know, you never know how brave you can be until you don't have no choice.
Now I see how people could jump out of burning buildings.
You couldn't figure it out before?
Look, Lisa, we still have a full day left.
- Why don't we make the most of it?
- I would like that, Carlton.
There's three of us now, we need to get another room.
I have a room.
Hey, isn't that great?
Now you and I can stay together and Lisa can stay with her.
I can't believe it.
How could you not take the insurance?
It only costs an extra $6.
Sweetheart, in honor of your new house we've put together a little photo album for you.
Oh.
Naugahyde.
Wow.
- You really went all out.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Just look at the pictures.
Oh, look, here I am at Camp Gucciwanka.
Ha.
Camp Gucciwanka?
Oh, yeah, that's Apache for "over-privileged.
" I drew a picture of the family, and that's you with the diamond.
Oh.
I'm gonna miss you all so much.
Will, you take good care of that little lady.
And, Carlton, you stay just who you are, I mean that.
And, Daddy, don't worry, I still have duplicates of all your credit cards.
Goodbye, little house.
Goodbye, little yard.
Oh, goodbye, little lamp.
No, I could use this.
- One down, four to go.
- Take it easy, Philip.
It's still about 13 years before our nest is empty.
Oh.
Hey, guys, listen, me and Lisa about to run to Roscoe, get a little grub.
Uh, Carlton, you wanna go?
No, three is a crowd.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- See you later.
PHIL, VIVIAN &  Bye.
- Did you forget something, sweetheart?
- Um, not something, someone.
I hate my life.
Yo, stay tuned for more Fresh Prince.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Lisa, hey, baby.
I know I talked to you three minutes ago, but I missed you.
Phoebe, no!
Phoebe.
Hey, I'm on a phone call.
I'll be out in a sec.
Phoebe, down!
No!
Phoebe, no!
Yeah, Lisa, you know I love you, baby.
Phoebe!
- Yes, I love you.
All right, so I'll see you tonight?
All right.
Bye-bye.
Oh, so, Carlton, what did you want?
Stop.
Don't move.
Let me see you caress the syrup with your tongue.
Why don't you let me see you caress a Tic Tac with your tongue?
When you are angry, your whole face, it has such character.
Well, look, why don't you get up out of my character while I'm eating.
I must rush to the easel while the hostility is still fresh.
Daddy, why do we have to do a family portrait anyway?
We're in transition, sweetheart.
And I want a portrait to capture us as we are before we drift further apart.
By the way, Hilary, what are you doing here?
Well, it's so dark at my house.
None of the lights work.
You have to have the power turned on.
Call the electric company.
Well, I tried, but the phone doesn't work.
About this portrait, sir am I to be involved?
Well, I don't know, I suppose when it's finished, you'll dust it.
I hope he's not painting it tonight, a bunch of us are going ice skating.
Yes, and I'm going to a Quayle in '96 Tupperware Party.
Hey, hey.
So you guys know about this party tonight, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Man, you know, everybody knows about that big party.
- All right, cool.
- All right.
Yo, man, how come I don't know about that party?
You out of the mix, man.
You're married.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Just because I got a girl, don't mean I can't hang with my boys.
Hey, cool, but be warned, there's gonna be females up in there.
Girls will be swarming like bees.
Let them swarm on back because I got the queen.
Okay, but once the party starts buzzing, you're gonna wish your stinger was free.
All right, hold, hold, hold, hold on.
The honey is always sweeter at the hive.
Now, you know bees got to go from flower to flower.
Oh, yes, sir, but once they start pollinating, then they Happen Uh Look, can we just talk, please?
Fine, fine.
But if you ask me, man, I think you need to dump that ball and chain.
Hey, Lisa.
Look at how cute You are a lucky man.
- Hey, baby.
- What's up, baby?
So, what's going on tonight?
You know, I've been thinking, you really been neglecting your friends.
Did you make plans with your friends?
I can cancel them, baby.
Will, you don't have to do that.
I don't care if you wanna go with friends.
Just tell me.
Maybe I'll have my girlfriends over.
We'll pop popcorn and dance to Janet in our nighties.
How come we don't never do that in our nighties?
Will, I'm serious.
Our relationship is based on trust.
I want you to have your own life.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

It's all about letting her know who wears the protective cup in the family.
Oh!
You never saw me.
Hi, Will.
Hey.
Wait, you look familiar.
Do you have, like, a really fat twin sister?
Will, it's me, Tina.
Ten Tummy Tina?
Girl, you must have lost 20 Eighty pounds.
- You look nice.
- Thanks.
You should get to know the new me.
I really firmed up.
I know the feeling.
Hey, look, Tina, baby, trust me, if this was two months ago, I would be down.
Well, but then, two months ago, you were still up.
Listen, I have a girlfriend and, you know, just I ain't trying to live like this.
So?
Tina.
Uh, Tina.
- Oh, look, make-your-own sundae.
- Ooh!
Aw, dang.
Okay, listen.
We're gonna hang out for a minute, dance, then we're heading back to your place.
Yeah, right.
This is a party, Lisa.
You've been tied down to one man too long.
You forgot how to work it.
Now, come on.
Guess you gotta serve yourself around here.
I know that hand.
Um See, what had happened at first was See, at first, I was at the game but then a sniper came.
And The coach had got shot.
I know someone who should be shot.
Will, you lied to me.
Wait.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Lisa.
Come on, now, if this was two months ago by now I'd have been up in this party in my drawers doing the Tootsie Roll.
But I'm not having any fun right now.
And you know why?
Because I feel guilty.
That's right, I'm at Hoochie Phi Hoochie and I ain't having no fun.
Now, that's progress.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.
What about you Miss Nightie-Wearing, Popcorn-Popping, Dancing-To-Janet Well-At-Least-That's-What-I'm-Going Tell-my-Boyfriend, Little-Party-Freak?
Will, I wanted to stay home, but my girls wanted to come out.
This ain't no trial, you don't have to explain to him.
Hush, puppy.
Guess who.
Look, honey, I don't know who you are but if you don't take your hands off my man you're gonna lose all that pretty hair of yours.
Sheesh.
Look, Lisa, sweetheart, why don't we take this discussion elsewhere.
This is not a discussion, Will, it is a fight.
And my jacket is in there.
It better be.
Come on, open the door, my girl's jacket is in there.
Hey, Will, what's wrong, man?
Baby, no!
I ain't playing with you, come on.
Will, you have no right to drag me home, I am not a child.
You're just a grown woman now, huh?
Listen, Will, I didn't do what you think I did.
Look, I don't even wanna think about what you think I think you did.
Oh, you know what, you're a regular old party girl now, Lisa.
Why don't you break it down for her.
Oh, okay.
Well, let's see here, Ashley.
Usually, at these parties there's a bunch of pathetic guys who have a good thing going on.
But they think they're missing something so they go out scamming, looking for someone new.
Think I can take it from here, Lis.
Thanks for the ride home.
Fine, Will, you do what you gotta do and you take your time but we're gonna handle our business.
Hey, don't everybody be walking away from me!
Ashley!
Listen, I am not playing with you, girl.
What is your problem?
It is none of your business, Will.
Oh, I found my 15-year-old cousin locked in a bedroom with a linebacker and that ain't none of my business?
Hey, man.
Um, we was talking about this movie we had seen.
Um, the movie we just came from it was about a linebacker and a fraternity.
You know, and Larry Fishburne played the dean.
Shut up, Will.
Is that the family room?
All right, young lady, out with it.
Okay.
I didn't go ice skating.
I went to a party.
And, yes, I was with a guy, but we were just kissing.
You have no business with a college fullback.
He was a linebacker, Uncle Phil.
Daddy, it wasn't just anybody.
He used to go to Bel-Air Academy and I had a big crush Save it.
There are not enough words in the English language to explain your behavior.
My God, do you have any idea the kind of danger you put yourself in tonight?
- All my friends - If all your friends jumped off the damn MTV building, would you do it?
Do you have any idea where your daughter was tonight, Vivian?
Hmm?
At a fraternity house playing touch football in the bedroom.
Ashley.
Mom, do you remember Andre Lawrence?
The fullback?
He was Ashley, go to your room.
- Mom, please let me - You heard what your father said.
- But, Mom.
- Go!
You all right?
I'm fine.
I was just trying to recall what it felt like to be 15.
So long ago, how could you remember?
I'm just so upset that I'm saying things I don't even mean.
I'm gonna go have a talk with Ashley.
You know, sir, if you really wanted to teach Miss Ashley a lesson you could always have her taken out of the portrait.
Miss Ashley and I are about the same height it would be a simple matter of painting my head on her body.
Phillip, Ashley's gone.
What?
Take the back streets.
I don't wanna be seen.
Shut up and look for Ashley.
- Hello.
Hey.
Lisa, what's up?
It's me.
Will, it is 1 in the morning.
Yeah, yeah.
I just called you two minutes ago.
Where were you?
- I was asleep.
- Uh-huh.
Sure you ain't just getting in?
Just as sure as I'm about to hang up on you.
How you gonna call me at 1, then ask me where I been?
All right, all right, all right.
My fault, my fault.
Look, Ashley ran away and I just thought she might be there with you.
No, you didn't.
Keep me posted.
All right.
When we find Ashley, she's reimbursing me for gas.
Where is she?
Well, if it was me and I ran away from home I'd probably check into the Four Seasons and get a massage.
Well, y'all should have seen Uncle Phil.
Dude just went straight loco.
That big vein in his neck looked like an anaconda.
Look, there's a method to my father's madness.
If he came down hard on Ashley, it was for her own good.
Man, you think everything your father does is right.
Of course, don't you?
Hell, no.
Carlton, Will's right.
Daddy is way too strict.
Well, he may be strict, but he's always fair.
Yeah, when you're a son.
Well, sons are different than daughters.
In your case, just barely.
If you're referring to the size of my endowment, it's almost as large as Hilary's.
God, I hope you talking about money.
Yes, thank you.
I'll tell him.
Sir, the precinct says they'll keep looking.
I can't believe she's out there somewhere, Vivian.
Our little girl.
Sorry, guys, we couldn't find her.
- Will, this is all your fault.
- My fault?
Where else did Ashley learn such behavior?
Wait a minute.
You're the one that chased Ashley out of here.
How dare you talk to me like that?
He dares because he doesn't respect you.
Neither of them do.
What a crock.
How you go and just tell a bold-faced lie like?
HILARY : Carlton, Will is right.
Daddy is way too strict.
Right, you think everything your father does is right.
Of course, don't you?
Hell, no.
- And listen to this from last week.
- Hey, man, what is wrong with you?
Hey, what up, Ash?
Hi, Will.
You mean we've been out running all over this city looking for you and you've been up in here?
Well, I did run away.
But there are some weirdoes out there.
You know something, this is all your fault.
What is that, like, the theme of this family?
"When in doubt, blame Will.
" If it wasn't for you, Daddy would never have found out about that party.
Ashley, that still doesn't mean that you should have been there.
Ashley, listen, college boys are like predators.
You know, they prey on innocent little high school girls like you.
They're like piranha, Ashley.
And you're 110 pounds of teenage chum.
A hundred and eight and I'm not as innocent as I look.
All right, I am.
Well you ready to walk that last mile?
Will, I didn't do anything.
The Lord is my shepherd Hey, everybody, look what I found.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Now, we've got a bit of a volatile situation here.
A powder keg if you will.
A mishandling of this situation could have repercussions that will reverberate forever.
Vivian call your sister and tell her she's about to lose her only child.
I'm gonna call her and tell her myself.
Look now, I could ground you forever.
I could put bars on your windows, I could put locks on your doors.
- Daddy - Don't "daddy" me.
Do you have any idea what you put this family through?
Running around doing God knows what with God knows who.
If I'd have asked, you wouldn't have let me go.
You're darn right.
You're 15 years old.
You have no business at a party with college boys!
- All my friends were there.
- Your friends don't live here!
I can't do this.
You talk to your daughter.
I'm done.
You guys hate me.
Ashley, if that were true, we wouldn't care when you did something foolish like this.
What you have to understand is that we know what's best for you.
It may not seem like that now, but one day you'll understand that.
End of discussion.
Mom, don't you understand?
Yes, I understand.
I understand you lied and you ran away.
And another thing as long as you live in this house, you will follow our rules.
That's it!
Mom.
Ashley, I understand what you're feeling.
But you have to consider the seriousness of what you did.
You really hurt us this evening.
All I want is for you to trust me.
Trust is a very fragile thing and you're gonna have to start earning it all back.
I messed up really bad.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Ashley.
Mama, I'm sorry.
I saw Ashley's tutor leaving.
Oh, yeah, they're actually gonna let Ashley eat tomorrow.
Yeah, that's what happens when you lie.
You gotta be punished.
So, what do you think your punishment should be?
Oh, I don't know.
I think it should hurt.
I think it should really teach me a lesson.
And I should be wearing some kind of hat.
You are sick.
Okay, no hat.
- I think people lie because the truth hurts.
- Yeah.
Like, take this jacket you're wearing.
What about this jacket?
I love it.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Ashley.
What's up, Nicky?
- Hey.
- Will, you have paper on your cheek.
Oh, Nicky, he cut himself shaving.
Why do you shave and Ashley doesn't?
Well, you know, it's because guys grow beards and some women don't.
You know, when you become a teenager, guys start to grow hair on their face and women start to grow, you know, they be - Taller.
- Ooh, you are right.
Taller.
Yes.
Why?
You are really asking a lot of questions, Nicky.
Nicky's at that age.
He's like an empty vessel waiting to be filled with knowledge.
Has anyone seen my Vogue magazine?
The one with that supermodel Tyra on the cover.
Hilary, that's 2 years old.
Geoffrey threw it away.
Why?
And some vessels just stay empty.
It says here in this magazine when decorating a home, price should be no object.
The more money you spend the better.
What magazine is that?
Rich People's Digest.
I got a subscription.
If I'm gonna be decorating my new house, I need all the help I can get.
This is a beautiful color for your drapes, honey.
Yeah, if you're a hotel in Vegas.
Plus, look at the price.
This is very reasonable.
Exactly.
All right.
There you go.
Right.
I think it's too heavy.
All right, let's lighten the load a little.
There we go.
Hey, yo, man, why I gotta carry everything anyway?
Simple, Will, some of us are born owls and some of us are born mules.
Guess which one you are.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I must be one of them owl-killing mules, then.
Okay, I have chartered our trails.
We're gonna hike in just below Limestone Falls then we're gonna raft down the Rocky Point and we're gonna spend our last night at Two Arches.
Huh.
Them arches better not be golden.
Don't worry, on this trip, it's just us and the elements.
Heh-heh-heh.
We're gonna be roughing it like frontiersmen.
Oh, incidentally, sir the limousine will be here to pick you up at dawn.
Great, I'm gonna go stuff my fanny pack.
Looks like somebody beat him to it.
- Hey, you guys.
Hey, Lisa.
- I brought the sleeping bag.
Oh, thank you, baby.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
Ooh, look at all this stuff.
- Yeah, we believe in being prepared.
- For what?
Hm.
Bad weather, snakes, global thermal nuclear war, you know.
I tried to tell puny the bear this is too much stuff.
I mean, come on, why are we taking wood?
Hello?
Campfire?
Carlton, I'm telling you, man, I'm not carrying all of this stuff.
What do we need this dumb box for?
That's not a box, it's a raft.
It seats six.
Hm.
How many Uncle Phils?
Wait, do you expect me to believe there's a raft inside this box?
Yes.
But whatever you do, don't pull the cord.
Damn.
There was a raft in that box.
Ain't my fault your stupid hurricane lamp got broken.
Well, if you hadn't inflated the raft, it wouldn't have fallen over.
Well, I'll pay you for it but the stupid thing can't be worth more than $60.
It had a built-in bug zapper.
And it cost 80.
- Well, I'll give you 60 for it.
- Eighty.
- Sixty.
- Eighty.
- Eighty.
- Sixty.
You got a deal, Daffy.
Cute, Will.
Tell you what, I'll take your $60 and I'll get the rest from your wages at the Peacock.
Let's have the money.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, hey, hey.
It's cool, dude.
Carlton, give him the money.
Hey, look, that's all we got, man.
That's it.
- I got more in my wallet.
- Take your hands out of your pockets!
Mommy, why are you crying?
Because Will is hurt, sweetheart.
- Why?
- I don't know why.
Nicky, come on, let's not bother Mommy.
Oh, he's not bothering me, honey.
I wanna make sure he's going to be comfortable.
We're doing everything we can for him.
Well, those white sheets can get so dingy.
Don't you have any nice pastels?
That's not our major concern at this point.
Excuse me.
Well, what about television?
He's not gonna just have basic cable, is he?
Miss, that is the waiting area.
Now, I know this is difficult but why don't you just go over there and wait.
Carlton, do you wanna talk about it?
He was aiming at me.
Vivian.
Vy.
Where's my boy?
Heard anything?
Nothing has changed since you called from the airport.
Aunt Vy, Will's in the recovery room.
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you.
Um, excuse me, Mrs. Smith?
- Lisa?
- Yeah.
Hi, sweetheart.
- Vy.
Philip.
- Well, I talked to the doctor.
Yes?
Will's in stable condition.
Now, the bullet was very close to his spine, but they got it.
Thank God.
There's a possibility there may be nerve damage.
But let's pray there isn't.
They'll move him to a private room.
- Can we see him?
- I made a deal, we can see him now but we're gonna have to go home after.
Why?
Well, apparently, we're driving the nursing staff crazy.
I don't understand, I'm just a visitor, why do I need medication?
And what is Prozac anyway?
I mean, do you think I need this?
I feel fine.
Hi, baby.
Hey.
Mom, you ain't have to come all the way out here.
Stop it, now, I'm just glad that you're okay.
Ahh.
Yeah.
Just think, I moved out here from Philly because we thought it was too dangerous.
- Oh, Will.
- Hi, Will.
Hey.
How are you, son?
Dude, what's up?
Hey, don't be looking at me like that.
Y'all know ain't no little bullet gonna stop me.
However, I will be doing my banking by mail from now on.
Knowing my luck, I'll run into a disgruntled postal worker.
Are you in pain, son?
Well, it ain't as bad as the last time Geoffrey made chili.
I guess you won't be wanting this, then.
I hate this generic stuff.
I'm gonna get you an Evian.
Hey, Ashley, what are you doing all the way over there, girl?
I'm scared to touch anything.
I don't wanna pull anything out.
Come on, girl, get over here and give me a hug.
- Aagh!
- Oh, my gosh!
Psych.
I can't believe you guys think this is some kind of joke.
Don't you realize what happened?
Will took a bullet for me.
He saved my life.
I did?
I was just trying to get the hell out the way.
Will, stop it, I don't think it's funny.
Carlton, come on, man.
We gotta have a sense of humor about this.
This kind of stuff happens all the time.
That's the problem.
It happens all the time.
I'm, uh, gonna go talk to him.
- Son, where are you going?
I don't know.
I'm going for a walk.
It's after midnight.
I don't need something to happen to you.
Well, there's nothing you can do about it.
These things just happen, right?
Carlton, I know you're upset.
You've been through a traumatic experience.
Now, if you just calm down, we can talk about this rationally.
You're always in control, aren't you?
Always know what to do, always know what to say.
You know what gets me?
The police aren't gonna find this guy.
And if they do, so what?
He'll be out in six months.
- That's not gonna happen.
- It's happened to people.
But the legal system isn't perfect.
Go talk to Will about our legal system.
It's such a joke.
People aren't even afraid of it.
Carlton.
Look, I'm frustrated too.
But as a judge, I have to have faith in it no matter how much I wanna go out and knock some heads.
Eventually the system will come through.
I'm all grown up, Dad.
Don't tell me any more fairy tales.
Mom, Mom, Mom.
I'm fine, thank you.
Okay.
I'm just trying to make sure my baby's comfortable.
Well, I'm as comfortable as I can be sitting on a bedpan.
- Well, you want me to?
- Don't go peeking at my stuff, Mom.
Thank you, baby.
- How's that?
- Oh, baby, that's perfect.
Oh, I see there's a new pillow fluffer in town, huh?
- Where's Carlton?
- He just wanted to let off a little steam.
I'll get the car, madam.
Chin up, Master William.
Get better, Will.
Ow!
Ooh, psych, psych, psych.
- Stop that.
- We'll see you tomorrow, son.
Right.
Oh, is Carlton gonna be cool?
Oh, yeah, he's fine.
I'll talk to him when he gets home.
- You get some sleep.
- Pfft.
I don't know if I can get any sleep the way that thing is here beeping.
Well, if it stops beeping, you're gonna sleep a lot longer than you planned.
Come on.
You coming home, Vy?
No, no, I'm gonna stay right here with my baby.
Go back to the house.
I don't need nobody babysitting me.
Well, you're not getting rid of me that easily.
Oh, baby, I'm too weak to fight.
You can stay.
All right, sweetheart.
- I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- I love you, Mommy.
- You'll get used to it, baby.
- I guess he told you.
Oh, shut up.
Boy, am I glad they're gone.
How do you feel, Will?
Well, you know how they say a paper cut is the worst kind of pain?
Eh!
Eh!
Wrong.
You don't have to do that.
- Do what?
- Entertain me.
Did you hear the one about the black dude that got shot at the ATM?
And how he was trying to be freaky with his girlfriend in the hospital room?
Stop.
Carlton, look out.
Look out, Carlton.
Will.
Baby, it's okay, wake up.
It's okay.
I'm glad you're here, baby.
Good morning, time for breakfast.
Shh, shh, shh  Oh, sorry.
Isn't it hard to follow that show with the sound off?
Oh, no, this is What's Happening!
!
I know all these jokes by heart.
Oh, check it out, look, look, look.
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh, Dwayne, Rerun ate my mama's cake.
Ooh.
Dee, Dee, please don't tell your mama I ate her cake.
Okay, Rerun, for Dee right price.
You're good.
Oh, that ain't nothing.
You should see my Webster.
What exactly do you want her to see?
Hey, what's up, babe?
Are you rested?
Yeah, I must have been tired.
Uh-huh.
You was talking in your sleep last night.
You always dream about Shaka Zulu?
Shut up, Will.
Oh, isn't that nice.
- Would you like me to read the card?
- No, I'll thank Jazz later.
I'll take it.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- Carlton.
Hey, what's up, man?
I'm glad you came back.
- Can you show me where I can get coffee?
- Sure, right this way.
Thanks.
So, what's up, man?
Are you gonna be all right?
Still can't get over it, Will.
If you hadn't pushed me, that bullet would have gotten me.
Well, not necessarily.
See, even if you stood right in front of me he still could have hit me from my belly button up.
I'm totally in your debt, Will.
Pfft.
Come on, you don't owe me nothing.
Yes, I do.
If you ever need anything, anything, it's yours.
Well, uh you could talk to Uncle Phil about, you know, sliding me into his will.
Forty, 50 G's, you know?
Actually, my father and I aren't seeing eye to eye right now.
I feel like everything he's ever said to me was a lie.
Come on, Carlton, that's a little hard, don't you think?
I spend my life believing in law and order, following the rules.
Then some maniac pulls a gun and all the rules change.
Well, I'm sick of being a follower, sick of being a victim.
I'm gonna start making some rules.
- Carlton, wait.
- What?
- Give me a hug.
- What?
I said give me a hug, man.
A brother get shot, he get a little emotional.
Now, get over here and give me some love.
All right.
All right.
What is that?
It's a gun.
Carlton, are you out of your mind?
You're walking around carrying a gun?
- What are you gonna do with that?
- It's for protection.
Carlton.
Whoa, man.
What, do you think it's that easy to just shoot somebody?
I'll close my eyes.
I was gonna eat that, man.
Everything's a damn joke to you.
So, what, you don't think I'm mad, huh?
I'm laying up in this hospital an inch away from being paralyzed.
You don't think I wanna get up and catch It's not gonna happen again, not to me.
Carlton, Carlton.
I understand that you're scared, man but the world can be a scary place.
You just got to learn how to deal with it.
Yeah, well, I found my way.
That's not you, man, that's them.
Look, I didn't come here for your approval, all right?
I came here to see how you were.
I'm out of here.
Carlton No more hugs, Will.
I saved your life, man.
I saved your life.
You owe me!
Now, give me the gun, Carlton.
Give me the gun.
I saved your life.
I want the gun.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you, baby.
Oh, man, this week has been hell.
Remind me to never get shot again.
It's always hard the first time.
I remember mine.
I'd forgotten how much Jewel hates anchovies on her pizza.
Well, the rest you can guess.
Good morning, Will.
Good morning, Lisa.
Jazz.
Oh, my goodness, Nurse Avner, you might wanna hurry up and go change.
Nurse Sigmund has on the exact same outfit.
Will, I have a special going-away present for you.
Oh, well, I'm on such a natural high from getting up out of here I'm sure my arm won't feel a thing.
- Oh, I think that's a safe bet.
- Woo.
Oh.
Have a nice day.
Check it out, Will.
I'm the black dude on ER.
Jazz, that is not a toy.
It doesn't have to be a toy to be fun.
Check this out.
Clear.
Remember, just because you're going home, doesn't mean you can slack off.
The harder you work, the faster you'll regain use of your leg.
- You think I'll ever be able to slam-dunk?
- Sure you will.
Oh, cool, because I never could before.
- I'll see you in therapy tomorrow.
- Bye.
Okay, baby, I packed your books and your Walkman.
Mm.
And this cute little backless gown that you just looked so good in.
- Is there anything else I can get?
- Uh, just my stuff in the bathroom.
- Oh, okay.
- All right.
- And don't forget my Magic Shave, baby.
Okay.
Tss.
- Oh, Will, you fell?
- Oh.
Yeah, I fell, unh in love with you, baby.
Lisa, will you marry me?
Marry you?
Will, did you take another one of those yellow pills?
I'm serious, Lisa.
I mean, you've been right here with me all through this thing.
The first face I saw every morning, the last face I saw every night.
I just want that to go on forever.
Will, I don't know what to say.
Your face says it all, baby.
Hey, listen, we should probably Ah.
We should probably keep this thing a secret, just spring it on people at the right time.
- Then it's gonna blow them away.
- It sure is.
Oh.
Oh, babe, I'm sorry I don't have a ring for you.
I can give you this one around my collar.
Heh.
Heh.
Hi.
Ready to go?
- Oh, well, Hil, where's everybody else at?
- Well, they're all at home.
It's just me.
WILL &  Don't touch that!
Okay.
I mean, Hil, on my big day, I thought that everybody would be here.
Oh, it's not their fault.
They're setting up for your surprise party.
They're giving me a surprise party?
Well, now that you dragged it out of me.
Ha, ha.
Well, come on, y'all, let's go.
Let's go.
Let me practice.
Oh.
Oh, God, wait, babe, hold up.
Um, I forgot to sign those release papers.
Hil, could you buzz the nurse for me, please?
No, not that one.
There has got to be an easier way to call the nurse.
Honey, honey, I don't think what you're doing is good for you.
And I don't think what you're doing is good for anybody.
Psht.
Ha-ha-ha.
Babe, listen.
Ahem.
May I have everyone's attention, please?
You are not gonna announce it in front of all these people.
Come on, baby, don't be shy.
Here, take this, take this.
Now, as you all know there's a person in this room who's very, very special to me.
A person who's warm, caring and extremely sensitive.
Oh, I love you too, Will.
Go sit down.
Oh, all right, there's two very special people to me.
Anyway, as I was about to say, I have a little announcement to make.
- Will, I don't think that - Oh, you're right, baby.
We have an announcement to make.
Me and Lisa are getting married.
What?
- Will, that's great.
Oh, thanks, Ash.
Congratulations.
You know, this precludes any possibility of us getting together.
To do what?
Good seeing you again, Lisa.
Well, ha, ha that's really news.
Since you're gonna get married maybe you and I should have that man-to-man talk in the kitchen, huh?
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Right now, Uncle Phil?
- Sure, okay.
Come on.
Uncle Phil - Congratulations, Lisa.
- Oh, thank you, Ashley.
Lisa, I want you to know that Will's as proud of you as I am of my sweet little bride, Jewel.
Oh, thanks, Jazz, that's nice.
Um, by the way, where is Jewel?
Her ex-cellmate broke out.
They're having dinner.
Will, what is all this?
It's too soon for you to get married.
Hilary's right.
Did I say that?
I mean, come on, I'm still decorating my new house.
When would I have time to buy you a gift?
Isn't anybody gonna congratulate me?
Yeah, yeah, come here.
My foot wants to congratulate your butt.
Boy, no way are you ready for marriage.
How are you gonna support a wife?
Now, now, Vy, I'm sure the boy has a very sound financial plan in mind.
- That's right, you tell her.
- Right.
After all, he is working full time at the college.
- It's part time, Uncle Phil, just part time.
- Oh, that's okay.
- I mean, you have that great hourly wage.
- Not to mention my tips.
That's right, that's right Well, now, just what exactly is 15 percent of a frozen burrito?
Oh, never mind.
That's okay.
Once you graduate and you start your career Um, what is it that you're majoring in, now?
See, I haven't exactly declared my major yet, Uncle Phil.
- Oh.
You're not giving good examples right now either.
Oh.
Aha.
Ha, ha.
I see what you're doing.
Hey, I watch The Cosby Show too, Uncle Phil.
Ha-ha-ha.
This is that episode where Theo drops out of school, right?
Well, yeah, something like that.
Yeah, well, a couple more Pudding Pops, you'll be there.
Ha-ha-ha.
Will, you are not getting married, and that is it.
Heh.
Look, Mom, I understand that this was a bit of a shock for you guys.
But you don't have to worry about me and Lisa.
We're gonna be all right.
You know why?
Because we got love.
What's love got to do with it?
GEOFFREY : Got to do with it, got to do with it Look, I really, really appreciate you guys' concern but I'm a grown man.
And with all due respect, if I needed your permission to get married I would've asked for it.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Come on, babe.
- Hil, run us past Lisa's house, please.
- Sure.
What are you doing?
Mrs. Banks said I could take this home.
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm serving that tonight.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- Guys, stop it!
Jazz, let go.
- Yes, I am!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Um Maybe we can run by X-ray on the way to Lisa's?
- Thanks, for a really nice party.
Could I speak to you for a second?
I know Will has probably told you we have some concerns about you getting married.
- You do too?
- What you talking about, Lisa?
Mr. Banks, it's not that I don't love Will.
It's just that all of this is happening so fast.
And I never really said I would marry him.
Of course, I never said I wouldn't either.
Well, you two should talk.
And soon.
I just don't want to devastate him with all that's been going on.
- Have you ever crushed anyone?
- Well   Okay.
Before we wrap up, let's test your reflexes.
All right.
Ow!
My goodness, those doctors must have crossed some wires in there.
- Quit messing around, Will.
- Ha, ha.
Oh, hey, hey, there she come.
There she come.
- What's up, baby?
Hi.
Oh, hey, tell her how good I've been doing.
Tell her how good.
He's doing great, and you must be the reason.
He can't stop talking about you.
See you tomorrow, Will.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
Hey, baby, I got a little surprise for you.
Unh.
Um, Will, I kind of got a little surprise for you too.
No, no, no, me first.
Check it out.
Unh.
Just get away from me.
- Oh, Mama, look, I can walk.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, I can't believe it.
Look at you.
Oh, yeah, girl, I got me some motivation.
If I wasn't walking down that aisle with you I'd probably still be upstairs in that wheelchair.
Ah.
Oh, what was your surprise?
Um Will, I don't really know how to say this, but I don't wanna get Don't wanna get what?
A ticket.
I'm double-parked outside.
Whoa, whoa, hold up, baby.
Come on, come on, come on.
That ain't what you wanted to say.
Look, there is nothing that you can't tell the man that you're gonna marry.
I don't wanna marry you.
See?
It wasn't that hard, was it?
- You're thinking of Lisa again, aren't you?
- Pfft.
Lisa who?
Girl, what you talking about?
I'm playing Scrabble.
D- U-M-P-E-D.
"Dumped.
" And you also made "lonely," "shocked" and "pathetic.
" No, no, no, Ashley.
That's mine.
I'm "pathetic.
" Yeah, you're right, Ash.
Look, I can't concentrate.
Maybe we should do something else.
Let's watch some TV.
Carlton, I think Montel is on.
Next on Montel Williams Women Who Won't Marry and the Losers Who Ask Them.
Give me that.
MAN : Yes, folks, at Willie's World of Wheels we lease every kind of transportation imaginable.
Lease a truck, lease a car, lease a van, lease a bus, lease a tractor.
G, to the kitchen, please.
Come on, Rain Man.
Hey, babe.
Are you hungry, baby?
- Not especially.
- You've got to eat something.
All right, just give me the same thing Uncle Phil has.
Just make mine a single-sized serving.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Hey, thanks a lot, Aunt Viv.
Oh, can you cut up my chicken finger for me, please?
Of course, dear.
Uncle Phil, my biscuit needs some butter.
Then I suggest you butter it.
My God, man, I'm in a wheelchair.
I've noticed.
I've noticed a lot of things lately like you moping around here, acting all helpless.
You can do some things for yourself, you know.
Sir, when you're finished eating, I've pre-pasted your toothbrush upstairs.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
You should be happy, Uncle Phil.
You didn't want me to get married and now I'm not.
Will, we know you're upset about Lisa.
Look, you know what?
I just wanna forget that she ever existed.
I never even wanna hear her name again.
Which reminds me.
Lisa called.
Come on, Will, it's time to go to therapy.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Every time I get around you, I wind up getting hurt.
You are so accident-prone.
Will, I am really disappointed in you.
Please, not another lecture.
Well, someone has to say it.
Being in a wheelchair is no excuse for wearing the same shirt two days in a row.
Hilary.
Look, you don't know what it's like to lose a fiancée.
Hello?
I was engaged last year, remember?
- Bungee accident?
- Oh.
Sorry, Hil.
You would think hitting the concrete like that would've made more of an impact.
Sorry.
Will, we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
But we never even would've been engaged if he hadn't been so persistent.
God, I must have turned him down like 10 times before we even went out.
Ha.
Really?
You know what made me finally change my mind?
That big old rock he put on your finger?
Well, besides that.
It was knowing that no matter what I said or what I did or how I acted he would always be there for me.
The point is, Will, if she really means something to you take a lesson from my fiancé.
Don't give up.
God, I miss him.
Poor, poor Tip of the tongue, Will.
Please help me out.
- Trevor.
- Trevor.
Thanks.
Wait, Hilary.
Hey, you know what?
I think you're right.
Maybe I did give up too easy.
- I'm gonna call Lisa right now.
Will.
Damn, you got good ears, girl.
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Hilary, do you mind?
- Oh, no, go ahead.
Oh.
Duh.
- Hey, look, Lisa - No, Will.
When I said we needed to talk I meant that I need to talk and you need to listen.
Will, you are stupid.
Well, stupid is as stupid does.
Well, what is that supposed to mean?
I don't know, but the movie made like a half a billion dollars.
So I say one thing that you don't wanna hear and that's it?
You just shut me out without even letting me explain?
"Will, I don't want to marry you" seems pretty self-explanatory.
Well, you're wrong.
Will, I love you.
But I feel like the only reason you asked me to marry you is because you're feeling vulnerable right now.
Well, getting shot kind of has that effect on a brother.
I understand that, but what'll happen when you're back on your feet and feeling like yourself again?
Baby, I don't wanna have to shoot you every six months just to hold on to you.
Look, Lisa when that bullet hit me, I gotta admit, it scared the hell out of me.
But it made me realize that maybe I don't have all the time in the world like I thought.
I mean, who's to say what'll happen tomorrow or next week or the week after that?
All I know is that I love you.
And, Lisa, believe me, that is never gonna change.
Well, in that case, the answer is yes.
Yes?
Ha, ha.
Yes.
Yes!
Hey, hey.
You wouldn't really bust a cap at me, though, would you?
- Not unless I have to.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- So you think we should tell your family?
- Oh.
I think some of them already know.
Good thing it's the ones on our side.
Come on out here, guys.
Give the bride-to-be a kiss.
Time for a toast.
Carlton, get some glasses.
Whoa.
Dom Perignon, the good stuff.
Tyler and I were saving it for our honeymoon.
Ha, ha.
Trevor, Hilary.
Right, Trevor, whatever.
Anyway, I figured it was the least I could do with all the injuries I've caused.
- Thank you.
- It ain't nothing, Hil.
Accidents happen.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh.
Hey, Ash, guess what.
Me and Lisa finally set the date.
- We're getting married in September.
Ha, ha.
- Oh, Will, that's great.
- Hey, listen, I even bought the ring too.
- Really?
How many carats?
Come on, Ash, it's not the size that counts.
That small, huh?
Well, I mean, I I I didn't get the ring I wanted to get, you know.
I couldn't afford the real cubic zirconia.
Hey, but check it out.
Presentation is everything.
Check it out.
Yo, G. Ahem.
I had Geoffrey bake the ring inside of her favorite cookie.
Aww.
Nothing says loving like something from the oven.
Heh.
- And Will Smith says it best.
- Hey, that looks great, G. - It certainly does.
- Uncle Phil!
What y'all watching, a Rosie Perez movie?
I wish.
Hilary gave us a tape of her talk show and made us promise to watch.
It's been on for three minutes, and we're almost done.
Oh.
Uh It's nothing, babe.
It's that thong underwear you bought me for Christmas.
- What's up, girl?
- I just wanted to come over and say thank you for fixing my sink.
- Oh, cool.
Um, baby, how about meeting me for a little midnight swim?
Ooh.
You got that, baby.
Where?
My living room.
Thanks to you, my apartment is flooded.
It will be days until I can get back in.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
I'm usually pretty handy with stuff like that.
Tell her, y'all.
Didn't I just fix the toaster?
See?
Before it wouldn't even get past the door.
Thanks, Will.
In the morning, I'll set it on dark and it'll meet me at school.
Maybe I should call my friend Denise, see if I can stay over there.
What you talking about?
You can stay in the pool house with us.
- Carlton, is that okay with you?
- Are you kidding?
Sure.
I love a good old-fashioned sleepover.
What say we rent a musical pop some corn and after that, dare I say, Yahtzee?
Dare I say: Ow!
Geoffrey, you look wonderful.
Is that a new suit?
It was, 20 years ago.
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, since I moved out I have really missed your sense of humor, Geoffrey.
Your wit, ha-ha-ha your charm your wit.
Ha, ha.
Your Oh, who are we kidding?
I need you to come work for me.
Miss Hilary, I already have a job.
Well, then, just part-time.
Look, I'm a career woman.
I don't have time to dust and push around that Oh, what do you call that big loud thing that sucks up everything?
You call him "Daddy.
" I'm sorry, Miss Hilary, but he'd never allow me to moonlight.
I'm expected to be on call for his 3 a. m. feeding.
I'll just use you in between meals.
Daddy will never even know you're gone.
Are you suggesting that I lie?
Big time.
Miss Hilary, I couldn't.
I've worked for your father for 20 years.
He's seen me through some very hard times.
Even paid for my dear mother's cataract surgery.
The extra money could get you that Beemer.
Well, it's not as if he gave her a kidney.
Hey, Lucy, I home.
Hey, baby.
No, Lucy, don't even try.
You cannot be in the show.
Hey, girl.
- Man, what is that smell?
- Oh, it's my chicken stew.
Girl, exactly what part of that chicken are you cooking?
- Come here, boy, I want you to taste it.
- Why?
I I I mean, I'd love to, baby.
- I made it especially for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, damn, I swallowed it!
What?
Oh, and it was finger-licking good, baby.
Hi, kids.
Hey, Mr. Banks.
Do you wanna stay and join us for dinner?
Uh, no, thank you, Lisa.
As lovely as that stinks Uh, uh, smells.
I wouldn't wanna interrupt.
I just came over to talk to you kids about your marriage.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
Not again.
We are getting married in September.
No, Will.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Your aunt and I have been talking about this.
We just wanna make sure that you get off to the best start possible which is why we're giving you this little engagement present.
"Note: Buy Reese's Pieces for desk jar.
" Other side.
Oh.
My fault.
"Dr. Whitehorn.
Psychologist"?
His specialty is relationship counseling.
Oh, Mr. Banks, Will and I are in love.
We don't need any counseling.
Yeah.
But I could damn sure go for some Reese's Pieces.
No.
Now, look, look, Will.
Look, marriage is difficult at any age.
Now, all counseling will do is give you tools to make your relationship work.
I mean, you wouldn't drive a car without taking at least a few lessons first.
Look here, Uncle Phil, I'm from Philly.
You know what I mean?
I was driving when I was 11, you know.
Of course, that was in the good old days before The Club.
Hear what I'm saying?
That'll put a crimp in the plans, you know.
Look, Uncle Phil, thanks a lot, man, but we both go to school and we work.
- We really don't have time for that.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.
Because I was gonna pay for your honeymoon anywhere in the world you wanted to go.
Hey, baby, what's Swahili for "ching-ching"?
I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, we don't need to be here.
We happy.
- Tell him, baby.
- Yes, very happy.
Yeah.
Hey, you know them little yellow smiley faces?
Just put some Hershey syrup on them, you got us, you know.
Great.
Then all I have to do is give you the skills to maintain that enthusiasm.
Oh, if you mean what I think you mean, I got skills, you know.
I was talking about interpersonal relationship skills.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
That's what I was thinking.
The two most important: respect and communication.
You see, it's very important  Oh, excuse me.
Dr. Whitehorn.
Ugh, it's you.
Listen, Rita, you are sucking me dry.
Look, you want more alimony, you talk to my first two wives, all right?
Never get married on a dare.
Ha-ha-ha.
Now, uh, where were we?
Um, respect and communication.
Ah.
That's right.
But look, for now before tomorrow's group session, I'd like to ask questions.
- Oh, cool, questions.
Knock yourself out.
- Okay.
Uh, where do you see yourselves Ah, that's an easy one.
Ten years, I see us, you know kind of like the Huxtables, you know.
Except I'm not gonna be delivering babies, I'm gonna be making them, you know.
You know.
But first, I figure we'd start out with Will, Jr., you know.
Then Willfred, then Willoughby, then Willard, you know.
Then Willis.
Will, stop.
"Will Stop"?
That ain't no good name.
Now, Willstafa, you know.
That's strong, you know, like, kind of a Lion King kind of feel.
You know, Will Simba.
Uh, we'll come back to that.
Look, let's take another question.
Oh, where will you be living?
- That's an easy one.
Right, baby?
- Yes.
- Cleveland.
- Philly.
Oh, this ought to be good.
Well, that new little Beemer of yours runs like a dream, doesn't it?
Ha, ha.
How should I know?
You've been hogging it ever since I signed the papers.
Just come on upstairs.
You know that table in Daddy's study?
I need you to carry it out to the car.
It's a pool table.
Duh.
Ha, ha.
Miss Hilary, I'm sorry, but I have duties here to attend to.
Besides, I'm still worn out from last night.
Oh, please.
I just had you do a little yard work.
I don't believe blacktopping your tennis court falls into that category.
You are so lazy.
Not too lazy to quit.
- Geoffrey, where have you been?
- Yes.
Last thing you said was: "I just need to step outside for a little fresh air.
I'll be right back.
" - That was seven hours ago.
- Aw, don't get into a hissy fit, sir.
- I left dinner in the oven.
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought we were gonna have to eat what Daddy gave us.
God help us.
You'd think a guy who eats so much would at least know his way around the kitchen.
Lisa, hi.
Where's Will?
- Will who?
Will, was there a problem in therapy?
Man, we are this close to breaking up.
Boy, that stuff doesn't work at all.
Oh, thanks, babe.
Oh, don't hurt me!
What is your problem?
Me?
Baby, just tell me one thing: Did you put something on or did you take something off?
Trust me, the next time I decide to take something off you will be too old and blind to care.
Listen, this is just stupid.
We shouldn't be fighting like this.
Okay, baby, you're right.
I'm sorry.
Aww.
Hey, put it there, dude.
- What?
- You have some nerve.
So you expect me to be a gourmet chef, raise eight kids and look beautiful 24 hours a day?
Too much?
And what exactly are you gonna be doing?
- I'm gonna be supporting y'all.
- Oh, on what?
That one-figure salary that you pull down at the Peacock?
Oh, no, you did not.
Oh, no You know what?
I could yell I could scream.
I could even call you some names.
But you know what?
One of us has to be the mature one.
And it ain't gonna be me, Aunt Jemima!
Ooh.
- Uh, hello, everyone.
Hi.
Yeah, what's up?
Um, Will, we're sitting over here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, there you go trying to tell me where to sit.
Look here.
I sit when and where I please.
You know what I'm saying?
Because I'm the man.
I'm the man.
You give me one good reason why I should sit over there.
Because your name is on the seat.
I knew that.
And you know how I knew that?
- Because you're the man.
- Because you're the man.
- You see what I'm saying?
They recognize.
- Tsk.
- Hello.
Welcome.
Yeah, whatever.
Well, tonight we're here to benefit from each other's experiences.
Those of who are just starting out and others who have had long and nurturing relationships.
Get the lead out, Weezy.
I'm walking as fast as I can, George.
Hello, Louise, George.
Hey, Whitey.
That's, uh That's Dr. Whitehorn.
Yeah, yeah, Horny.
Where do you want me to sit?
Never mind.
I'll sit wherever I want, because I'm the man.
I'm the man.
Tonight, why don't we begin with a simple exercise?
I'd like each one of you to say three things that you like about your partner, okay?
Uh, George, why don't you start?
Well?
Well, what?
The man said to name three things you like about me.
- Fine.
Your mother died.
Your mother is dead.
Your mother ain't living no more.
- Okay, let's try role reversal.
- No, unh-unh.
It'll give you insight into how your partner perceives you.
Now, who'd like to go first?
- Oh, I'd like to.
- Oh, great, Lisa.
Show us Will.
Who the man?
I'm the man.
Because I ain't spending no 4.95 on some stank skeezer to take her to the salad bar.
If a honey wants to go with me to the Sizzler she gots to be all that.
She gots to look good.
Yeah.
You know.
Because I'm the man.
Nicely done.
I believe it's my turn.
Go ahead, Will.
Um Oh, excuse Um - Can I borrow this for a second?
Thank you.
Hey!
Man.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Tsk.
You want some popcorn?
Tsk.
Why you screaming?
What, I'm supposed to be a cook, a cleaner do everything you want.
What you gonna do?
Tsk.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Look, you need to stop acting so stupid.
You need to get a job, do something so you can buy me something nice.
You never bought me nothing nice.
You just be acting all dumb.
Why you talking about your uncle all the time?
He ain't fat.
He is big-boned.
And I thought I had it bad.
Ha-ha-ha.
- And it's about to get worse.
- Ow!
Hey, hey, hey.
Now, none of that.
If you can't verbalize your aggressions then here, try a bataka.
Oh.
- And this is for Mama.
- Hey!
And this is for calling me Weezy when you know I'm sensitive about my asthma.
Try this on your asthma.
Hey, hey, hey, time out!
Time out now!
Stop it!
Look it, why don't we all just take a five-minute break, okay?
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Fine.
- Man, she always been like that?
Ha-ha-ha.
- No, she used to be mean.
Ha-ha-ha.
We tied the knot 40 years ago and I've been swinging from it ever since.
Yeah, I hear you.
Sure, there's women like that make you realize why God made darkness.
- Hey, man!
- What?
- You insulting my wife?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up a second there, cul-de-sac.
Look, I am twice your size and half your age.
You need to chill out a little bit.
Your mama.
Oh, no.
You didn't just talk about my mother.
Okay.
Well, I'll talk about your daddy instead.
Your daddy is so fat that when he went to school he sat next to everybody.
But still he wasn't as fat as your fat mama.
Ha, ha.
Oh!
Come on with it!
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
You're not supposed to Stop it now!
Stop it or I'll charge you double.
What?
Who you talking to?
- Oh, that is so juvenile.
- I know it.
I have never seen anything so stupid.
You calling my husband stupid?
Honey, the only thing stupid here is your big-eared boyfriend.
He looks like a car coming down the road with both doors open.
- Oh, no, Miss Thing.
It's on now.
- All right, sister, bring it on.
Hey!
Come on, you're missing the whole point here.
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
You're supposed to verbalize, not beat each other up!
- You might as well be taking karate.
Coward!
Hey, what's up, Uncle Phil?
- What in the world happened?
- We got into a huge fight.
A fistfight?
No, we used bats.
On each other?
Oh, no, no.
We beat up this old couple.
Yeah, but they had it coming, right, baby?
- Yeah, baby.
- That's what I'm saying.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I mean, that's terrible.
Oh, no, no, no.
This was at therapy, Uncle Phil.
Hey, you know, it actually helped us out a lot.
We decided we're not gonna get married in September.
Ooh.
Okay, if that's your decision.
Yeah.
We're gonna move the wedding up to May.
I mean, we saw tonight that we got our little petty differences but when push come to shove, we've got each other's back.
Ha, ha.
I'm glad you're getting along.
That's still no reason to move up your wedding.
- Well, you know, that's not the only reason.
We wanna miss the rainy season in the motherland.
That's where you're sending us for our honeymoon.
Heh.
Oh.
That's from the travel agent.
She says she could retire on this one.
Ha-ha-ha.
Thanks.
Pinch me, Geoffrey.
Not on what you're paying me.
But for 35,000, I'll slap you silly.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, G, what is your idea of, like, the perfect wedding?
Any one at which I'm not serving hors d'oeuvres or pouring champagne.
Wow, then you're gonna think ours sucks.
What's up?
- How you doing, Will?
Remember, Lisa's pop's coming from Cleveland.
So don't be late for dinner.
My fault.
For a second there, I forgot who I was talking to, you know that?
I'm actually looking forward to meeting him.
We'll probably discuss the wedding while he's here.
In fact, I have finished the guest list and good news.
I've kept it small, just 300 people.
Three hundred?
Who are you inviting, the entire Wayans family?
- Uncle Phil, who are these people?
- They're just, you know business associates, contributors to my campaign and people I need to suck up to.
Uh, how about the people that I wanna invite?
- Like who?
- Uh, how about my mom?
- Oops.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha, ha.
Uncle Phil, the thing is we really didn't expect all of these people.
We were gonna have the wedding in the garden.
It is gonna be in the garden.
The garden at the Bel-Air Country Club.
Uh, gee, you know, I kind of miss the good old days when you were against this wedding.
Ah, ha, ha.
Ah, I see the problem.
See, you're under the impression that this wedding is for you.
Oh, what the hell was I thinking?
Get this straight, son, ha-ha-ha my cash, my party.
And I'm going to network like it's 1999.
G, does anybody in this house care what I want?
No.
- What are you guys doing?
- Hilary's being audited by the IRS.
Thanks to you.
Carlton said he could save me money, so I let him do my taxes.
Relax, I'll take care of it.
I don't understand any of this.
I have money invested in companies I've never even heard of.
- Like what?
- Like Carlton Co. I said I'll take care of it.
Look, I don't wanna scare you, but these bureaucrats are heartless.
Well, what should I do?
Smile, be polite and wear a spandex dress that makes them sit up and say, "Aye, chihuahua.
"  Carlton, that's terrible.
Hilary would never degrade herself like that.
Absolutely not.
I'll wear leather.
Why don't you just wear hot pants and a bustier with two big cones on it?
Before Memorial Day?
Whoo.
Oh.
I don't want you to worry, baby.
It's your wedding, so you two should get exactly what you want.
Besides, it's the father of the bride who throws the wedding so I'll set Will's uncle straight.
- Right.
- Oh, thank you, Daddy.
Aww.
Yeah, thank you, Daddy.
Uh, I was raised in France.
You know, we:  Oh, hey, here's the man now.
- What's up?
- Hey, son.
This is Lisa's father, Fred.
Oh, so this is Fred.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Oh, same here.
Cool.
Enough of the small talk.
Look, Fred has something that he wants to say to you.
Right?
You know, about the garden?
Phil, your garden is beautiful.
What are these, perennials?
Those are flowers, Fred.
You know, like a bride carries at a wedding.
Oh, that reminds me, Will I was at the club, I put down a deposit on the rose garden.
We're all set.
You know, now would be as good a time as any.
Just dive right in here.
Ladies and gentlemen, Fred.
That's generous of you, Phil, but as the father of the bride I'll take care of the wedding.
I understand where you're coming from, Fred, but I have to invite several guests I think it's only fair that I shoulder the financial responsibility.
Well, I appreciate that, Phil, but I've been talking with the kids and it seems to me that they have their hearts set on something smaller.
- You go, Fred.
- Like family and friends.
- Go Fred.
- In the garden.
- Go Fred.
- In Cleveland.
Whoa, Fred.
What was I thinking wearing this outfit?
I look like a call girl.
A very expensive call girl.
Thanks.
Oh, but this just doesn't feel right.
Well, Hilary, you can't leave.
There's something I haven't told you.
You could go to prison for this.
Oh, that's ridiculous, it isn't that short.
Hilary, grow up, we're dealing with the United States government here.
Now hike up that skirt, sister.
Move it.
I'm waiting.
Excuse me, when will Agent Dailey be with us?
I'm Agent Dailey.
Well, this is a serious waste of a Wonderbra.
And for a talk show hostess a home gymnasium is a justifiable business expense.
What about you, Mr. Banks, do you work out?
Uh Well, I try to keep fit.
Looks to me like you succeeded.
Ooh.
I could use something cold to drink.
Can I get you anything?
- Nothing for me.
- Well, I'll have a What an odd duck.
She's just not focusing.
Oh, she's focusing, all right, on your chest.
I mean, as unbelievable and disgusting as it sounds, she wants you.
That's ridiculous.
You know, this audit is a lot more complicated than I expected.
Perhaps we should continue this tomorrow.
Oh, but tomorrow's Sunday.
I'm getting a chemical peel.
Oh, can't miss that.
Mr. Banks and I can handle this without you.
- We can?
Yes.
I wanna just get together and crunch some numbers.
You know, Phil, it sounds to me like you don't think my town is good enough for you and your ritzy friends.
Hey, man, why you ain't tell me you invited the Ritzy's?
Fred, let me simplify this for you.
Now, ha, ha, if flying out here is a problem for you and your guests don't worry about it, it's on me.
I'm gonna be on you too.
You keep throwing your money in my face, you fat cat.
Okay.
Ding, ding, ding!
All sumo wrestlers to the showers!
I'll have you know, I put $10,000 aside for this wedding.
Oh, please, that wouldn't even cover the invitations.
Okay, okay.
Kumbaya, my lord Everybody!
Kumbaya Now, there is nothing wrong with being a hardworking man.
- Have you ever done an honest day's work?
- I happen to be a judge.
I'll take that as a no.
- Now, just wait a minute.
- This is completely out of hand.
- You stay out of this, Will.
- Yeah, this does not concern you.
And you, you can forget about coming to Cleveland.
Because a big soft marshmallow man like you, you wouldn't last five seconds.
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to see you try to fit in down at the country club.
Crushing beer cans on your head telling everybody why Sears is the place to buy tires.
- I know you don't wanna talk about tires.
- Oh, no, you don't.
You wanna take this outside?
We are outside.
Fine.
You wanna take it inside?
Inside and upstairs, downstairs.
I'm coming!
Coming.
Just my luck Whitney Houston and I had just survived a nuclear holocaust.
And now I was the last man on Earth.
- What is going on?
Where's Mr. Moneybags?
What do you mean by disturbing my family this early?
You call 5:30 early?
Hell, the day is half gone.
And so is my little girl.
- What are you talking about?
- Here.
Oh, my God.
- What is it?
- Will and Lisa have run off to Las Vegas.
They've eloped.
Well, good night.
Forget it, Hilary.
There's no way I'll cheapen myself to satisfy the urges of that she-devil down at the IRS.
Excuse me, but you're the guy who ran his picture in the personals with the word "please" written under it.
Hey, I met a nice gal through that ad.
In some cultures it's considered a real turn-on for a woman to have a sloped forehead.
- Oh.
Did you guys hear?
Will and Lisa eloped.
- Really?
Yeah, yeah.
Carlton, if you don't do this I'm gonna tell Daddy about Carlton Co. Fine.
Next time you wanna sit up all night and girl talk, don't call me.
I'm definitely the Marilyn Munster of this family.
You know, this is all your fault, Fred.
If you'd listened to those kids, they wouldn't have run off.
Me?
You're the one that wanted them to get married in a damn sand trap.
The country club does not happen to be a Excuse me, excuse me for interrupting but don't you think it's time for you to call a truce?
Both of your kids are married.
Like it or not, we're all family now.
You know she's right, Fred.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
My poor Yvonne, she always wanted Lisa to get married in a big church wedding.
She's probably turning in her grave right now.
You're lucky she's dead.
What?
Uh, uh, I mean, my wife is still alive.
What?
She's gonna kill me when she finds out about this.
Ah.
You want a beer?
Actually, I'd prefer a white wine spritzer.
Oh.
I'm sorry we weren't at the wedding but, you know, two kids running off in the middle of the night like that.
- Kind of romantic, huh?
Ha, ha.
- Yeah, and a whole lot cheaper.
Hey.
Right this way.
Now, this is more like it.
Ain't no way I was getting married at a place called Temple Emanuel L. Lewis.
Welcome to the Chapel of Soul.
I'm Angela and I'll be your wedding coordinator.
Can you dig it?
Well, let's rap about the kind of ceremony you want.
Did you hear that?
It's about what we want.
Oh, yeah, that's right, power to the people up in here.
We offer a number of packages here.
Groove on this.
Oh!
Ooh, this is the bomb.
Oh, I knew I liked this place.
Baby, look, they got a package on my all-time idol.
Who's that?
Who's the dick who's a sex machine to all the chicks?
- Shaft?
- You're damn right.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, baby, he's been my idol ever since I was a kid.
Can we have this one?
Baby, can we have the Shaft package?
Can we please do that one, baby, please?
Well, okay, baby, but I don't wanna be given away by the pimp.
But, baby, that's what makes the whole All right, all right.
Give us the Shaft.
Well, Hilary's investments were primarily in mutual funds and stocks although in November, she sold off a number of hairs Shares.
Now, if you'll refer to form 2106 I'm having a little trouble reading my copy.
Well, maybe if you turned on a light.
Why don't I just share yours?
Carlton, this whole audit can be resolved very quickly.
All you have to do is cooperate.
What are you doing?
Nobody has to know, nobody gets hurt.
You're busted, lady.
If you don't sign this form exonerating Hilary, I'll sue you for sexual harassment.
Just try.
You have no idea what you're up against.
Neither do you.
I thought you might try something, so I took precautions.
That was a tape recorder?
That's right.
I have the whole sordid encounter right here on tape, Dailey.
You're dilly-dallying days are done.
Dork.
Will?
Does this look silly?
What are you talking about, baby?
- You look beautiful.
- Aww.
Ha, ha.
This is exactly how I pictured my wedding.
Well, more or less.
Will, Lisa, your Shaft wedding extravaganza is ready to begin.
Solid, let's get it on.
Oh, wait, hold on, baby.
I wrote my own vows.
Oh, Will, I can't wait to hear them.
Come, my children.
Who's the black Philly man that's gonna Take this fine woman's hand Smith That's fine, that's me.
You're damn right Who is the man that's got some vows In his hand to tell his woman Will Smith Can you dig it?
"Lisa you're my sun, my moon, my stars.
You're my whole universe.
You make me feel complete.
I wanna be with you forever " Smith Sure enough.
Right.
Um "From the first time I saw you I knew that I wanted to be with you always.
I knew that I wanted to hold you and love you " Smith Will Smith, yeah Right on.
All right.
Um They say this cat Smith Is a bad mother Shut your mouth.
Well, they talking about you.
Can I do this, please?
Um, where was I?
"Lisa " You're a complicated man There's no one who understands you But your woman Will Smith  Look, Lisa, what I'm trying to say is  All right, that's enough!
That's it.
Look, Lisa, baby, I'm telling you I want to marry you, but definitely not like this.
Right on, Will.
Oh, by the way, dude, your Isaac Hayes impression stinks.
I don't know, I thought it was pretty good.
I don't understand, the IRS is just letting me off?
What did you have to do?
I don't wanna hear this.
Don't worry, I've done nothing to be ashamed of.
I blackmailed her.
She was harassing me.
Listen to this.
She'll have fun, fun, fun Till her daddy takes the T-Bird away Fun, fun, fun till her da Carlton, that's annoying, but it's not harassment.
Thank God I pressed the wrong button.
The B-side is John Travolta's polka classics.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Phil, I tell you, this is the life, man.
And that butler of yours makes one mean sandwich.
What is that, Grey Poupon?
- Mm.
You like it?
- Ooh.
I'll see you go home with a case of it.
- Ha, ha.
- Hey, listen to this.
Now, the country club let me slide my wedding deposit over to the pro shop.
- Yeah?
Now, for five years, I've had my eye on one of those turbo driven golf carts.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
So Daddy's coming home with a Turf Buddy.
- All right.
- Ha, ha.
Man, you made me think of something.
All my life I wanted a Harley-Davidson.
And with the $10,000 I'm saving on that wedding I can get the hog of life.
- Five.
- Fred.
Oh, Fred.
- I'll tell you.
- We got some great kids.
Ain't it the truth, huh?
Hey, guys, what's up?
Look, we got good news.
No, we already know, we read the note.
Oh, you don't get it, we didn't go through with it.
Well, you know, it really didn't feel right, you know without all our family and friends there.
So we decided you guys can go ahead with the traditional blowout wedding.
- With all the trimmings.
- Yep.
So, uh, Uncle Phil you can fly in all my boys and all my boys' boys and all my boys' boys' boys, you know?
- Ha, ha.
We're gonna rock that Bel-Air Country Club so hard we'll have Bob Hope do the tootsie roll, you know what I mean?
Ah, well, hear this, son, you two are gonna get married right here on this patio and you're gonna like it.
- Daddy, we decided - Don't worry we'll get you some cake and something to wash it down with.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We can talk about this.
The wedding's not gonna be till May.
Ha, ha.
So, Fred, you wanna take a spin around the block in my Turf Buddy?
I'm there.
Hey, can you pop a wheelie?
Only if he sits on it.
It's like I don't believe this mess.
I mean, doesn't anybody care what we want?
Nope.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Will, I don't think I've ever seen you bite your nails.
Are you worried about something?
I was not biting my nails, Ashley.
Well, when I'm nervous I put a bag over my head and breathe very deeply.
- Does that help?
- Absolutely.
By the time I regain consciousness I've forgotten everything I was worried about.
Come on.
I know something's bothering you.
Oh, okay, I'll admit it.
You know, I am getting married in two months and that does give a brother a lot to think about.
Heh.
That doesn't mean I'm worried about my future because I'm not.
That's how I eat them.
Oh, Will, there's nothing to worry about.
So what, you and Lisa have no place to live.
- And no money in the bank.
- And a crummy dead-end job.
Heh.
Oh, wait.
That would be me.
Well, thank you guys very much.
I feel better now.
- Don't worry.
You and Lisa will be okay.
- Right.
You'll always be able to make a living.
You do own a squeegee, don't you?
No, wait a minute.
Me and Lisa will be just fine.
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I got a whole lot of great ideas to make me some money.
- So, what's the problem?
- I ain't got no money.
It takes money to make money, Ashley.
What I need is somebody to just walk in and say You know what?
I just made a bundle on the stock market.
Ha.
Now I just need something to invest it in.
CHORUS : Hallelujah, hallelujah  Hey, hey.
Hil, you always get money from Uncle Phil.
How do you do it?
Well, first I tell him that I love him.
Then I hug him so tight his wallet falls out and I kick it under the couch.
Ha.
So you hug him just to get money?
That is low.
Well  Give me a hug, you big bear.
Will, if this is about another one of your investment ideas, forget it.
I don't know, they're just a little too What is the word I'm looking for?
- Stupid?
Ha-ha-ha.
Bingo.
- Whoa, wait a minute.
- Dad doesn't need financial advice from you.
Why do you think he has me?
I don't know.
Drugstore was closed that weekend?
Daddy, why don't you hear Will out?
He might say something you like.
Well, I guess you're right.
My father always said there's no such thing as a bad idea.
Yes.
But your father never heard about fried-chicken-flavored aspirin.
What did you call it again, Will?
Rotisserie-gold-icillin.
And let's not forget about his beepers that cough.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
That one could've worked.
You just never thought it through enough, Uncle Phil.
See, you're sitting in a movie theater, your beeper go off.
Instead of hearing beep, beep, beep, beep, you hear:  See?
- That's a lot less annoying, right?
- Will, I am not interested in any of your harebrained get-rich-quick schemes.
Okay, okay.
Uncle Phil, now listen.
This new idea is not stupid.
And I do not wanna get rich quick.
I just wanna be a married man who's responsible and realistic.
- And I need to do it in two weeks.
- Two weeks, Will?
You know, two days would be even better.
If you have an idea you want me to take seriously present it to me in a well-thought-out, professional manner.
You know, beat by beat.
Mm, mm, mm.
Little Lance Ito.
Who'd have thought it?
Come in.
Hey, hey.
Hey, look.
Hey, dude.
I'm only gonna say this once.
Get off me.
I'm only gonna say this twice.
Your Honor, these gentlemen claim to know you.
- You want me to throw them in the lockup?
- Oh, would you?
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
Oh, all right.
Thank you, Kevin.
Get off me, Kevin.
What do you two want?
I'm in the middle of making a very crucial decision here.
Uh, go with the original.
Extra crispy is overrated.
- Get out.
Out.
- All right, all right.
Is it worth five minutes to hear the investment opportunity of a lifetime?
- No.
- I'll take it as a yes.
Hit it, Jazz.
Uncle Phil, mon how would you like to live in an island paradise?
- You expect me to buy an island?
- Oh, no, mon.
I expect you to retire there.
Boom!
Oh.
Look at this man.
The sun from your melon be blinding the little children.
Blee-bah-bah!
Get to the point!
Okay, okay.
All right, okay.
Okay.
Uncle Phil, all we're saying is all this could be yours if you invest in this.
An apartment building?
No, no, no.
This isn't just an apartment building, Uncle Phil.
This is  Chalet Towers.
Uh-huh.
I don't think I'm interested.
Well Jazz lives here, Uncle Phil.
Oh, that's very different.
I know I'm not interested.
Oh, come on.
I don't want our cozy abode turned into a strip mall.
I lived in a strip mall, Mr. Banks.
And I don't need to tell you how hard it is to take a bath in the men's room sink.
- Bailiff!
- Oh, okay.
All right, look, Uncle Phil.
If you will just look at the figures.
Just please look.
Look.
The current owner has to sell quick.
We can make a killing on this.
Is the floorshow over yet?
I get the feeling you're not taking me seriously, Uncle Phil.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Whoopi.
But I can assure you that Donald Trump does not negotiate business deals playing a ukulele and wearing a Bullwinkle hat.
Okay, okay.
Point well taken, Uncle Phil.
But facts are facts.
And if you just look at the figures, I'll leave.
Okay, I'll look.
Okay, I'm looking.
I'm looking.
I looked, now leave.
WILL IMITATING CARLTON : Dear big guy, I got really excited when this crossed my desk.
Take a look-see.
Carlton.
Yeah.
Hey, I wasn't doing nothing.
Hey.
Hello, Master William.
- Danish?
- Only on my mother's side.
- Uncle Phil.
- Good morning.
Morning.
Carlton left something.
He wants you He wants you to read.
- Wants you to read it.
- Carlton worked up a proposal of his own.
- Oh, yeah.
He be proposing stuff, you know.
Ah.
Mmm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
This is impressive.
Yeah.
Now this is how you put together a presentation.
See how he's organized all the facts and figures here?
Yeah.
Some of these figures look pretty good.
Mm.
You just like that piechart in there, don't you?
Ha, ha.
Well, you can joke if you want to.
I wouldn't mind taking a big bite out of this pie.
So you mean you like this presentation, Uncle Phil?
I certainly do.
Oh.
Hey, I'm sorry, son.
It's just that, you know well, this is where Carlton shines.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, you know my presentation was nothing compared to this.
Oh, get the Oh, wait a minute.
This is my presentation.
- Look.
What that say there?
- "Presented by Will Smith.
" Oh, that what it says?
You know, it's amazing because just last night you were saying how stupid this was.
It must have morphed.
Yeah, well, see, I really flipped through it rather quickly, you know and - You backpedal any faster, Uncle Phil you're gonna moonwalk right through that wall.
So you want me to take a chance on you, huh?
No, I want you to give me a chance, Uncle Phil.
Listen, I'm really serious about this.
I'm not asking for a handout.
You're gonna make a bundle on this deal too.
Okay, son.
I'll have my accountant check it out.
Uh, whoa, hold it.
Little problem, little problem.
Got a little time problem here.
This place is gonna go fast.
Look, just give me the 5 percent, let me put it down.
I mean, you spend more than that on Milk Duds.
You know, in the course of a year.
You know.
You know, Will, you backpedal pretty well yourself.
I think you got yourself a deal.
I'll call a real estate agent as soon as they open.
- All right.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
- All right.
- Let go of my hand.
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Whoo!
Congratulations.
- We closed escrow at 5:00 this evening.
- Really?
- We are gonna make a bundle.
- All right.
Excuse me, but someone's in trouble.
That's more like it.
Ha, ha.
He's right over here, officer.
- Philip Banks?
- I'm Philip Banks.
It's been a pleasure serving you.
- Well, what is it, big guy?
- Well apparently, I'm the owner of housing that has substandard living conditions.
I told you to get a big-screen TV.
Not this house.
Chalet Towers.
The tenants have filed a suit against me.
- What does that mean?
- It means that I'm a slumlord thanks to Will.
Excuse me, my beeper.
Whoo.
Aw, man, I don't know what all these complaints is about.
This place ain't that bad.
Find something nice to say about that.
I think I killed a rat.
Well, that's enough, you two.
We got a long day ahead of us.
Gotta meet with the tenants and get some repairmen up here.
Dad, if it wasn't for Will, you would never have had to set foot in this hellhole.
- Don't worry about me.
Remember, I wasn't born rich.
I know how to rough it.
Could someone grab the cappuccino maker?
- Got it, G. - Thank you, Master William.
Well, Uncle Phil, the only way it could get rough now is if Geoffrey forgot your croissants.
Would you just set things up?
I'd like to get this mess cleaned up before the word gets out.
Too late, big guy.
The slumlord allegations made the morning paper.
Good Lord, some unscrupulous person must have tipped off the press for a tidy sum.
Oh, this is just great.
Just great.
Oh, hey.
Hey, man.
Come on, Uncle Phil, let's look at the bright side here.
Eh?
Now our little penthouse got central air.
Whoosh.
Ventilation.
Yeah.
That will have the tenants just flocking in.
And so will this.
You allow pets.
Good Lord, who knows what kind of vermin are in here?
How do?
I don't have time for you, Jazz.
I have to meet with the head of the tenants association.
- Okay.
Before I go, this'll make you laugh.
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
The head of the tenants association.
That's me.
But wait a minute.
Jazz, you mean you're the person that's suing my uncle?
- Man, what were you thinking about?
- Just trying to protect your investment.
After you put a couple of million dollars in this place, it'll be worth thousands.
Can I see the list of complaints, please?
"Somebody keep making them damn Chevy Chase movies.
Dude in apartment 3G keep calling me sugar drawers.
" Complaints about the building, Jazz.
I think they kick in right here, Uncle Phil.
"Sticky stuff on the stairs tastes bitter.
" Oh, my God, let me see this.
I only have seven days to bring every violation up to code and look at all of these.
Look, you want me to start calling repairmen?
No.
He wants you to call the idiot who keeps greenlighting all those Chevy Chase movies.
Carlton, let's get a move on.
While Will's calling, we'll check everything.
- Start from the roof, work our way down.
- Right behind you.
Oh, I bet you are, Carlton.
Because you can't kiss his butt from here.
Good one, Master William.
Ha, ha.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, well, look at this.
A cracked mirror, peeling paint.
Come on, all this stuff is cosmetic.
I still think we got ourselves a sound investment here.
Dad, come over here.
What kind of idiot would patch the roof with newspaper?
What took you so long?
What's up with the carpenters?
Oh.
Didn't you hear?
Their new hits collection comes out next week.
Oh.
Well, jeez Louise we better rush down and wait in line right now.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Hey, are you having fun with me?
Very little.
Half of our workers didn't show up and we are not exactly professionals.
We got a ton of work to do and we got less than four days to do it in.
What's this "we" business?
I'm here for one reason only.
To protect Dad's investment.
If your dad gets sued for everything he got, who's gonna protect you?
- Let me at it.
- All right.
Hey, look.
Just hold the flashlight into the fuse box so I can see.
Please?
Thank you.
Hey, look at this.
- What?
What do you see?
- Bunny rabbit.
Ha, ha.
Look.
An American eagle with one wing.
Stop it, Carlton.
Now, put it back in the fuse box, please.
This is dangerous.
Not if you know how to read.
Look, it says touch here.
- Cool.
- But wait.
There's more.
"A town risk.
" What the heck does that mean?
A town risk.
Oh, at own risk.
Sorry.
So how are you two doing?
Not bad, all things considered.
In fact, this week was kind of invigorating.
Which reminds me, I think I'm gonna go freshen up.
I think I saw a hydrant on the corner and now I know how to use a wrench.
What the heck is he happy about?
This thing was a disaster.
- Oh, no.
Will, this place looks - Like hell?
Hell looks a lot better than this, I hope.
Don't worry.
Since the repairmen didn't show up they gave me a week's extension.
So come on.
You've been working night and day.
You've done your best.
Yeah, I did my best and look what happened.
I don't even know why Lisa wants to marry me.
Well, you got me there.
You used to be a lot better at these little talks, Uncle Phil.
I'm scared, man.
I mean, what if I never get my life together?
Will, I really did not wanna have to go here, but you're just gonna make me do it, huh?
Hey, man, don't you think I'm a little old for a spanking?
You know, of all the kids, you give me the most grief.
But you know what?
You are the one that I never worry about.
You mean that, Uncle Phil?
Yeah.
Just don't tell anybody.
Hey, wait, wait.
Hey, man, I've got to tell Carlton.
- No, come on.
Just let's go.
Wait, um  Look, Uncle Phil, man, um, you know, I just wanted - I wanna say, you know, because - Yeah - Yeah, sure.
Me too.
- You know?
- You know You know what I mean, right?
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Sure.
And they say guys can't express their true feelings.
- You know what I'm saying?
Hah, hah.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That's ridiculous, isn't it?
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Ouch.
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, let's go.
Look, I love you, Uncle Phil.
Let's jet.
Oh, "let's jet.
" That was hip.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Hey, Mr. Banks, I just wanted to say - Oh, that's okay, Jazz.
- You don't have to thank me.
- Thank you?
Damn, a coat of paint in a roach motel and you're all over yourself.
- I came to make you an offer.
- Offer?
Yeah, an offer to withhold my rent until I can come up with it.
Not on your life.
Very well, then.
Thank you for considering my proposal.
Have a nice day.
Hey, landlord.
Do I detect a hazardous stairwell?
Ooh.
My God.
Uh, that's okay, Uncle Phil.
His rent check would have bounced too.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Wait till y'all see this, this is huge.
If you xeroxed your butt again, I'm not interested.
Uncle Phil, wait till you see this bill.
Lisa spent $1200 on a bed.
I hope it comes with a canopy because at that price, it's the only roof we'll have over our heads.
Well, get used to it, Will.
You're about to marry and you know how women are.
No, Philip, how are we?
Fine.
And you?
I'm telling you, it's not like Lisa to spend this kind of money.
I'm telling you, she's possessed.
It's like some evil force has taken over her mind.
Something not of this Earth.
Hi, everyone.
Is Lisa here yet?
We're going shopping again today.
Ah!
Excuse me.
Hey, what's up, bro?
How you doing?
Looking for my cousin, she works on the next set.
She's the host of the Hilary Banks Show.
What's her name?
Cleopatra Jones.
Cleopatra Jones.
Brother, look, she's tall, light-skinned sister.
She drives a red Maserati.
Oh, dag, that's your cousin?
She's fine.
She's right over there.
Thank you.
Hey, tell Cleopatra Reggie said, "What's up"?
MAN : Cameras and audio, stand by, please.
Hey, Hil, what's up?
Look, I'm in a little bit of a bind here.
Now, I found Lisa's engagement ring, but I don't get paid until Thursday.
I was wondering, could you lend me a couple of hundred for the deposit?
I think I'm gonna faint.
All right, but while you're down, can I get some dough out your wallet?
Hi.
Hilary Banks, right?
I'm pretty sure he's talking to you.
I see you around here a lot.
You like our show?
I can't take my eyes off it.
Can I touch it?
Places, everybody.
People, work like you're being paid.
One more scene and we're home.
What a fabulous butt.
You know, it gets me around.
Please, and we're counting in five, four, three, two The police think I killed Carlos.
But on the night he was killed, you were here with me, painting my portrait.
You can give me an alibi.
I'll go to the police now.
All right, but be careful.
The roads are so icy.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Royce I owe you my life.
We're clear.
Get rid of that kid, Jerry.
I think he's a pretty good actor.
Well, who cares?
I'm the star, and I say replace him.
Hey, you can't treat an actor like that.
What do you think he is, a writer?
Okay, please.
Hil, I gotta be honest, I kind of agree with her.
I mean, come on, man, the dude's a brother and he ain't supposed to be like, "I'm looking for a Julius Caesar salad.
" I mean, come on, man, you know, he got to be down here, you know.
Hey, look, baby, you need the cops, we don't need to go down the station.
All I got to do is walk out your front door carrying your TV, you know, okay, man.
Who in the hell is this?
Our new Royce.
Hire him, Jerry.
Now.
Huh?
You're not gonna believe what happened.
I've got some great news.
You're moving out?
- Even better.
- I'm moving out?
I can't wait to hear your great news.
- Listen - I'm gonna have to.
Troy and I are working late on our book tonight.
- Troy?
- Mm-hm.
Professor T. Johnson is a Troy?
- What did you think the T stood for?
- I was hoping Thelma.
Bye-bye, everybody.
- Bye, Mom.
- Love you, Mom.
Can we get back to moi, please?
I got a part on that soap opera, Now and Forever.
Oh, please.
They hired you somebody who's never acted in his life, to star in a network TV show.
Pppt.
Well, it happens.
Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, my money troubles are over.
I need you to check out my contract.
Man, I ain't seen so many zeros since Carlton's square dance recital.
Hardy har, hello.
What a sense of humor.
And you don't think this guy has talent.
You know, you're going to the top, Will.
But you're overlooking one small thing.
What?
You mean beside that little chocolate Tic Tac you call your head?
Ha, ha.
Killing me.
He's killing me.
Ha, ha.
But, seriously, Will, you know, you're going to need management.
- Someone to look out for you.
Someone to - Take 10 percent.
Why, I'd love to.
Will, aren't you nervous about acting?
I mean, that show's done live.
Nervous?
What are you talking about?
I'm a natural.
I can do this part in my sleep.
Do I play a convincing coma victim or what?
Well, you're no Sunny Von Bulow.
Ha, ha, ha.
Look, laugh if you want to but tomorrow, I'm coming out of my coma.
- You're actually gonna speak?
- Right, I called all my boys in Philly.
They're gonna watch it on a big-screen TV.
I just hope that Sears lets them stay for the whole show.
You still want me to help you learn your lines?
Oh, yeah, and I'll help you into the kitchen.
Oh, you know, ever since I bought her this big old ring  she have a hard time walking without falling over.
Come on, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.
- Wanna see Will's show?
We have it on tape.
- No, soap operas don't interest me.
Oh, this one's hot, Daddy.
See, Joan was having an affair with Carlos right behind her husband's back.
Not that they were in the same room or anything.
Joan lied, told her husband she'd been working late at the office writing her memoirs.
That reminds me, Mrs. Banks called to say she'll be working late again with Professor Johnson at her office writing her book.
Jody, I can't believe my eyes.
Please, come closer.
Oh, Royce, I'll never leave you again.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
Hey!
What you doing?
That wasn't in my script.
Well, that kiss wasn't in mine.
Oh, well, come on, baby.
That was a ad-lib.
All us good actors do it.
That ain't personal.
I might as well be kissing Flavor Flav, gold teeth and all.
Will, the only person I want you kissing on is me.
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, now, come on, baby, be fair.
The only reason I even took this job was to put that ring on your finger and to make you happy.
So if I have to crawl into bed with 10 beautiful woman that's just a sacrifice I'm gonna have to make.
All right, people, places.
Coming back from commercial in 10 seconds.
Excuse me, but I can't flush the commode.
C, it's a prop.
Nice seeing you again, Joan.
I need show energy, people.
Okay, stand by, Ina, and counting.
INA : Coming in five, four, three, two Oh, Royce, thank God you're conscious.
Now you can confirm my alibi.
But first, there's someone here who can't wait another moment to see you.
Not - Not - That's right.
Jody.
Hello, sleepyhead.
I'll leave you two alone.
You have a lot of catching up to do.
No, wait.
Jody I can't believe my eyes.
Please, come closer.
Royce Royce, tell me you love me.
I love you.
Royce, I don't blame you for being angry with me, I don't.
But I promise, I'll never leave you alone again.
I can't tell you how that makes me feel.
Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
I don't believe it.
Vivian's working late with the professor again.
Do you realize she has missed dinner every night this week?
And yet, inexplicably, we've had no leftovers.
Can I ask you a question?
If you were a woman would you find me attractive?
Nope.
Well, now, I know this is gonna sound absurd but I think Vivian and the professor are having Uh Uh Uh Oh, sir, surely not.
The two of them have absolutely nothing in common.
Why, he's 15 years her junior.
Whatever would they do together?
Hey, baby, you know, I've been thinking.
You know, I'm gonna quit.
I know how uncomfortable the love scenes make you.
They don't make me uncomfortable.
Oh, sure they do.
That was before you explained it to me.
I believe you said, and I quote: "I might as well be kissing Flavor Flav.
" But, of course, that was when Flavor Flav was a woman.
That ain't got nothing to do with it.
Besides, ain't you got something to do?
No, sadly, this is the high point of my day.
That and coming up with names for my Chia Pet.
What do you think of Larry?
La-la-la Larry.
Larry.
Look, babe, the truth is, I'm just not that good an actor.
Well, you seem like you're doing a pretty good job right now.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, you're gonna do just fine.
You know what?
You're right, I am.
Thanks a lot, babe, I feel a whole lot better.
I'm gonna go out there and knock them dead.
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.
Carlton, please get me off the show.
Are you insane?
If you quit, you don't get paid.
But what's most important is, I don't get paid.
Look, the only way you can leave and still get the money is if they fire you.
Carlton, sometimes, man, I just wanna hug you.
Oh But this ain't one of them times.
MAN : Now and Forever will be right back after these messages.
Master William's scene is next.
I must say, it is exciting watching him on the telly.
I guess, but it's true what they say, being on TV does add 10 pounds.
So does watching it.
Will, isn't this rewrite great?
- I haven't read it yet.
- Will, are you crazy?
Do you realize you're live on air in 60 seconds?
Oh, yep, yep.
Places, people.
Okay, people, one more scene and we're on the freeway.
Oh, my God.
Ina, get that damn midget manager off my set.
Doesn't he know those stairs go nowhere?
- Get ready to count.
- In five, four, three, two To freedom.
I'll drink to that.
Royce, if it wasn't for you, I'd be in prison right now.
I should be the happiest woman alive.
You still miss Carlos, don't you?
More than I can say.
I know how you feel.
I know you do.
You love Jody so very much.
Actually, uh We We broke up.
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
She's a pro, she'll get the kid back.
Uh, don't you mean that you, uh?
That you, uh You thought about breaking up, but decided against it and now your love is stronger than ever?
No, no, like I told you, we broke up.
You wanna dance?
Come on.
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
Any minute, my husband's gonna come through that door.
- Now can we panic?
- Cue dough boy.
I don't care if he's not ready, get him in there now, now, now!
I said, any minute now my husband is going to walk through that door and say Where are we?
Derek, darling, what a surprise.
What are you doing here so early?
I don't know.
Sure you do.
You came here to give her something.
Remember?
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry it had to end this way, my dear.
If only my little plot to frame you had worked.
You mean, you killed Carlos?
No, that was me.
That's right, I shot Carlos.
And that's not all.
I'm the one who shot J.R. too.
And I shot the sheriff.
But I did not shoot the deputy.
Do you ever wanna work in this town again?
Painting portraits?
No.
But you see, I'm young and I'm restless.
I only got one life to live so I got to follow my guiding light and search for tomorrow.
Follow him, camera four.
I don't care if he goes to the commissary.
Hey, who knows if I'll wind up living out the days of my life in a mansion in Dallas on the comer of Melrose Place drinking Falcon Crest out of a brown paper bag.
Royce, don't you care about anybody but yourself?
Sure I do.
I care about you.
It's not because of those expensive clothes or your fancy jewelry.
That big Zsa Zsa wig you've be wearing.
I love you for who you are.
Who you really are.
The bald and the beautiful.
Isn't this great?
I told Daddy the soaps aren't predictable.
Got that right.
Tune in tomorrow for another episode of Now and Forever.
We're clear.
What the hell do you think you were doing?
I want him fired, Jerry.
Fired!
Now, wait a minute, hey.
If I get fired, you still got to give me mine.
- Ain't that right, C?
That's right.
You'll give my client what's coming to him.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
Sir, this is a letter to Mrs. Banks from him.
Oh, just go for it, sir.
I'll swear it came that way.
- "Dear Vivian " - Good Lord.
Oh, I can't believe it either.
He called her "dear.
" - Philip, are you reading my mail?
Hm?
It didn't come this way.
So now you know.
Philip, I didn't want you to find out this way.
What were you gonna do?
Throw me a surprise party?
No, but I wanted to be with you when you read it.
"To the most important person in my life my beloved husband, Philip whose support and patience have made this book possible.
I love you always, Vivian.
" You dedicated your book to me.
Of course, sweetheart.
Who else was I going to dedicate it to?
Professor Johnson?
That noodle-neck kid stomps on my last nerve.
- I love you.
- Aw.
Hey, hey, Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv.
Get a room.
Interesting performance, Master William.
I haven't seen such a disaster on the telly since they cancelled Manimal.
Well, I got paid, didn't I?
I'm gonna just sob all the way to the bank.
You know what I'm saying?
It's too bad you won't get to work with Halle Barry.
Please tell me you meant Chuck Berry.
Well, it's all here in Soap Opera News.
Apparently you or whatever lucky devil will be playing Royce comes out of the coma a changed man.
According to this, Royce is moving in with Miss Berry next week.
- Didn't you get your script?
- Ah!
I knew there was something I forgot.
Head start, coming in five, four, three, two
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Look, Carlton, for the last time, no.
I do not want a hypnotist at my bachelor party.
But, Will, you don't know how incredibly cool it is.
I don't want cool, fool.
I want something simple.
Just me and my boys barking like seals at naked women.
But, Will, that's so politically incorrect.
No one likes naked women anymore, believe me.
Tell me again, why did I make you my best man?
You said I'm like the brother you never had.
No, no, I said you like the brother I never wanted.
Look, Will, I put a lot of thought into this.
The least you can do is keep an open mind.
All right, all right, fine.
Maybe there is something to this hypnotism stuff.
You are getting shorter.
When you wake up, you will be very, very short.
Damn, see, that stuff does work.
Here are the directions to the Crescent Rock School.
Now, you have to have Nicky there for his interview by 10 a. m. That interview was today?
Philip, don't tell me you - Well, uh Uh  Hmm.
Distant drums say man with giant pants forget important interview.
Will, this is serious.
This is one of the top two schools in L.A.  Oh.
I was just playing, Aunt Viv.
It's cool, relax.
I'll take Nicky.
- What are you doing in about two hours?
- Sorry, Dad, I have a hair appointment.
Well, can't you cancel it?
Good one, Daddy.
Ha.
Uh Hello.
I said I'll take him, Uncle Phil.
Carlton.
Got a class.
Uh, Will Smith's in the house.
- Hello.
- Geoffrey.
Certainly, sir.
I'll just have to make this triple fudge bundt cake tomorrow.
- Mm.
Geoffrey's out.
- Geoffrey's out.
Ashley, can you drive him?
Sure, my bike has a basket.
Well, Uncle Phil, it looks like it's down to me.
Or that weird dude that be vacuuming our pool.
- Oh, Gus is here?
- Uncle Phil.
Look.
Oh, all right.
All right, you can You can take him.
All right.
- Big mistake.
- Hey, what are you talking about?
What, you think I don't want Nicky to get into a good school?
Education is very important to me.
Say, don't you have a class now?
Oh, that's not important.
All right, suppose they ask you why you wanna go to their school.
- What do you tell them?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Say, "I think this school has a nurturing environment which will best realize my education potential.
" Or you could say, "In two years, I'll be bigger than you.
" Will, if you don't mind I'm trying to get Nicky ready for his interview.
Well, you need to stop pressuring him.
You treat him like a ventriloquist's dummy.
That's not what I'm doing.
Nicky, what school do you wanna go to?
The best school in L.A. Crescent Rock School.
Yeah, I was wrong, Carlton.
You're the dummy.
Hey, Nicky, check it out.
Yo, post up, post up, post up.
Ooh.
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, look.
Now, Nicky, I don't want you to be nervous, all right?
I want you to ignore everything that Carlton said.
Just be yourself, all right?
Now I know what Uncle Phil must feel like in a Miata.
Hi, I'm Penny Abigail Jillette.
This school has a warm, nurturing atmosphere.
I'm Nicky.
Is there any apple juice?
Hi, I'm Ruby Jillette.
I'm Penny's mom.
- Oh, hey.
Hi, I'm Will.
I'm Nicky's cousin.
- Ah.
That may be why the other adults were standing.
Uh, well, Penny seems to be a really bright little girl.
- Sorry.
- Uh Um, yes, she is.
She started writing poetry at age 3.
Now she's publishing a little magazine for the kids on the Internet.
Yeah, well, you know, Nicky be writing too.
You know, yeah.
You know, he He just wrote, produced, directed his first screenplay.
The Forest Gumby.
Look, I can make myself dizzy.
Nick Nicky  That's a part of his comedy act.
Heh.
Yeah, that one killed them at Def Jam, Junior.
Ha, ha.
Nicky, why don't you sit?
Ooh.
Hi, I'm Miss Jansen, one of the kindergarten teachers.
- Basically, we're just observing the kids.
- Mm-hm.
Seeing how they play, how they interact with one another.
Oh, hey, well, Nicky here is a big interacter.
You might call him the last interaction hero, you know.
It looks like we've got a couple of sculptors.
I made an Arabian stallion.
That's remarkable.
Well, wait till y'all see what Nicky made.
Shoot, it's Uh This This is a It looks like a rock.
This is that mountain from Hawaii, Mount Kichikichiyayadada.
It's really a turtle.
He's inside his shell.
Is he hiding because he's nervous about going to a new school?
No, he's watching Power Rangers.
Well, that's great.
I've gotta go now and set up your snacks.
Can I help?
Sure you can, Nicky.
Come on.
What you making now?
What, an artificial heart valve?
So how'd the interview go?
Oh, great.
You know, I mean, not "great" great, you know.
But it was good.
It was good.
You know.
You know, not that good, you know.
But What is the word I'm looking for?
- Bad?
- Worse than that, but I'll go with bad.
Oh, Will.
Look, come on, it wasn't Nicky's fault.
That's right.
Will's the one that got yelled at for stealing.
Look.
Well, she had it coming after the way she talked about your mountain.
It was a turtle.
Nicky, go make yourself dizzy.
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Stop, stop, look.
Just sit down.
Sit here.
Ah.
Nice work, Will.
You'd better hope that he gets into the Considine School.
The head of admissions is coming to interview the entire family and, unfortunately, that includes you.
Ho, ho.
Hold the phone, big guy.
Will and I have a magical evening planned.
Are you sure that while Aunt Viv was pregnant with Carlton she wasn't, you know?
You promised we'd go see the hypnotist, remember?
Oh, look at this.
Tippy The Drunken Penguin is his opening act.
Ooh, you think we could get him for my bachelor party?
I wish.
Do whatever you want.
Just be sure you're back here promptly at 8.
We're going to show those people from Considine that we're a warm, caring loving family or I'm going to kill you.
Oh, come on, Uncle Phil, hasn't there been enough black-on-black violence?
Man, I will see you at 8.
At the sound of the bell, you will awaken from your trance.
However, you will think that you are naked.
Three, two    Look, Will, she thinks she's naked.
Isn't this exciting?
Carlton, are you sure Aunt Viv didn't?
Now, who would like to be my next volunteer?
Someone who doesn't embarrass easily.
Pick me, oh, Great Mentos, pick me.
Ooh.
Shoot me, oh, Great Mentos, shoot me.
Uhh How about you?
GREAT  You are in a state of full relaxation.
The sound of my voice is very soothing.
And you will accept any suggestion that I make.
I want to take you back.
At the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
Will, wake up.
The show is almost over and you haven't even touched your pie.
Pie.
Oh, my God, Uncle Phil.
Carlton, we were supposed to be back at the house at 8:00.
Come on, I'm gonna go get our coats.
Remember, at the sound of the bell, you will be 4 years old.
Can I help you?
Could I have my coat?
My fault.
Hey, hey.
- Well, it's about time.
Man from Considine School's gonna be here any minute.
Hey, look, I'm sorry we're late, Uncle Phil.
And you just forget it.
There's no way I'm humiliating myself by having some corny loser at my bachelor party.
Hey, don't talk about The Great Mentos like that.
I wasn't.
All right, just settle down.
Is everything ready, Ashley?
I think so.
I've replaced all the video tapes with insect documentaries.
Good Lord, Hilary.
What are you reading?
The Victoria's Secret catalog.
It's their end-of-the-season thong blowout.
Ha, ha.
Ooh.
That's a good issue too.
Everything in there is half off.
You know what I'm saying?
That is not the kind of image we wanna present.
Give me that.
Or better yet, give me that.
Oh, there you are.
There's my little man.
Come on, sweetheart, have a seat right here.
Philip, this is ridiculous.
I hate pretending to be something we're not.
Oh.
Well, fine, Vivian, so Nicky doesn't get into a good school this year.
He can stay home with Will watching Power Rangers and making himself dizzy.
Honey, here, just hold this.
And try to stay awake.
Whoa, G, man, something smells good.
Aren't you glad I use Dial?
Oh, you meant the crab puffs.
Yeah, man, these things is kind of tiny.
I seen Uncle Phil pick bigger chunks of food out of his teeth.
Ha, ha.
Come in.
That never works.
He's here.
We better get out there.
What the heck is wrong with you?
I gotta go potty.
Well, what are you telling me for?
You gotta take me, please?
Come on.
Hey, the buddy system stops at the pool, mister.
Look, come on, I gotta go.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, what are you tripping for?
Uncle Phil's in there, let's go.
Will's acting kind of weird.
It must be all that rap music.
I'd like to strangle the man who invented the doorbell.
The bell, that's it.
Geoffrey, Will's been hypnotized.
The Great Mentos made him think he's 4 years old.
Can he make me think I care?
Will, Will.
And this is our son, Carlton.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, and this must be Nicholas.
Yes, stand up, Nicholas and shake Mr. Spiegel's hand.
I can't, my legs are numb.
Oh.
Oh.
Look at that, the boy would rather read than walk.
Isn't that beautiful?
Heh.
So who's the musician?
Oh, that would be me.
Ha.
I play a little cello.
But this is a bass.
Well, the cello's in the shop, this is a loaner.
Oh, the World of Discovery series.
This one is marvelous.
The Ant, Nature's Busiest Worker.
Oh, yes.
Ants are extremely intelligent.
I still can't believe they run their own farms.
- Ha, ha.
Well, yes.
Mr. Spiegel.
Won't you try one of our crab puffs?
I got the recipe from our favorite little bistro in Paris, Le Bistro.
Actually, madam, I got it from the Gary Coleman Cookbook.
Hope you like short ribs.
Ah, I hear the little guys now.
Ha-ha-ha.
- So is that a Princeton tie you're wearing?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, I'm a Princeton man, class of '69.
- You're kidding, class of '73.
- Ha-ha-ha.
You like seafood?
Of course.
See, food.
Crash through the line of blue And send the backs on 'round the end Fight, fight for every yard Princeton's honor to defend Rah, rah, rah PHIL &  Argh!
- Come on, Will, let's go in the kitchen.
- I don't want to.
No.
- I'll give you a snickerdoodle.
- Okay.
Certainly is great to have another Princeton Tiger in the house.
Ha, ha.
I need something that rings.
Oh, I know, the oven timer.
Oh, H-E-double-toothpicks.
Ooh.
Geoffrey, do you have anything with bells on it?
Why, certainly, Master Carlton.
I just happen to have a trolley in my trousers.
Whoa!
I need you to stay put, young man.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Okay, I'm gonna go look for something with a bell.
You're not gonna move, right?
- No.
- Good.
Simon says, "Freeze.
" That's it.
Little boys who don't behave go to the pool house.
Make me.
Ha, ha.
My pleasure, you little rug rat.
Ooh, ooh.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Stop, I'm gonna tell.
Help!
Help!
That's it.
You're on a time out, mister.
Now, come on.
You're sitting in the comer.
What the hell is going on in here?
He can't talk to you.
He's in time out.
I don't care what kind of shenanigans you're trying to pull.
We're not pulling anything.
Will's been hypnotized.
He'll snap out of it if I find a bell, but I can't find one to ring.
I'll ring your head like a bell if you don't get in there.
When I first read the brochure for Considine School I knew it was the perfect Somebody wanna hear a joke?
Excuse me, Will, I'm talking here.
So I decided Okay.
What's the most musical part of your body?
I don't know.
Your nose because you can pick it and blow it.
Ha-ha-ha.
I don't get it.
Okay, I got another one.
I got another one.
Could I speak to you for a minute?
Pick it and blow it, oh, I get it.
Ha.
Excuse me, mister, I'll shine your head for a nickel.
Ha-ha-ha.
Will.
Over here.
Now.
He's a little high-strung, isn't he?
Oh, look what you did to the poor little fella.
For the love of God, does nobody have a bell?
Obviously, you're in some sort of a family crisis here and I think it's best if I just be going.
Uh Uh Oh, no, please.
Mr. Spiegel.
I can explain the entire situation.
I'm sure you can.
To another school.
Good luck.
I found a bell.
What the hell is in those crab puffs?
Well, that hypnotist certainly can put on a show.
Yeah, I'm just glad he unhypnotized me.
Too bad we got stuck behind that ice cream truck on the way there.
Yeah, those bells turned you into a raving maniac.
Hey, I missed dinner, okay?
Philip, you'll never guess what happened.
The Crescent Rock School called, they've accepted Nicky.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, put it there, my man.
Pssh!
Ha-ha-ha.
They said it was his sincerity that impressed them the most.
- They liked that he was just being himself.
- That's what Will told me to do.
Oh, you preach it there, little bro.
That's what I'm talking about.
You know, it just seems to me that there might be a cash gift involved here somewhere, I don't know.
Well, I'll settle for just a hearty handshake.
Psh, psh.
All right, bro.
- Don't push it.
- Come on.
I know you're not still mad at me about last night.
I was hypnotized.
I couldn't help it.
No, I suppose not.
I guess weak-willed individuals like you are just susceptible to that kind of mental manipulation.
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'll walk him, but somebody else gonna have to pooper scoop.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
Master Carlton's trying to get a date with his computer.
Oh, damn, what happened, man, the toaster turn you down?
Har-dee-har-har.
This romance chat line on the Internet happens to be a great way to meet babes.
Look, I think the handle I've picked is pretty nifty.
Loser Boy.
Well, honesty is one way to go.
Will, that's a typo.
I'm Lover Boy.
And I guess lying is the other way to go.
Heh.
No, I can come up with a better one.
Ah!
How about this one?
Hershey's Kiss.
Huh?
Because you're little you're chocolate and you're rich.
And then your head come to this stupid little point and, you know:   Geoffrey, I am so excited.
Will put a personal ad on the Internet for me and I already got a response.
Listen to this: "Hershey's Kiss would like to get together with Brown Sugar " That's me.
" for a Nestlé's quickie.
"  You're going out with Hershey's Kiss?
What's so funny?
Miss Hilary remember when you caught me in the potting shed with Sabrina, the tennis tutor?
Oh, I certainly do.
And Daddy was so mad when I told him.
Yes, remember I said I'd get you back?
Yeah.
We're even.
Geoffrey, come back here.
Where did all the shoes come from?
Shh.
They'll hear you.
These are not just shoes, Hilary.
These are Pro Kicks.
The shoe fairy sent them.
Heh-heh.
Cecil from Ladies Footwear sent us shoes?
A guy named Ernest sent them.
He's an old friend of Dad's.
Oh, these shoes are great.
I'm never taking these off.
Man, this will change my whole life.
Yes, now you can drive the car without sitting on phone books.
Oh, so Ernest sent these?
Yes, Ernest did.
I love Ernest.
Ernest is God.
Who the hell is Ernest?
Well, he's the president of Pro Kicks.
Well, he's opening an office here in L.A. Oh, man, it's gonna be great seeing him again.
Well, him and I go way back.
He's the reason that I pledged Pi Nu.
Uh Excuse me for a second, sir.
Um The name of your fraternity was Pi Nu?
So that made you what, a pie man?
Yes.
Oh.
So, you know, you probably hung out with the sorority girls from Beta Crocker.
Oh That's funny.
I guess you wouldn't be interested that Ernest said he has an entry-level position open and he just asked me if I knew any bright young man who needed a job?
- Oh!
Oh!
I'll take it.
I'll take it, Uncle Phil.
- Hmm.
Look, I just need to have a quick talk with my current employer.
I quit.
Will, please, to get a job like this you have to be highly skilled in my particular area of expertise.
- What, sucking up?
- Exactly.
Hey, you two, that's enough.
Ernie is coming here tonight and I want you both to behave in a civilized, dignified manner.
If in doubt, just follow my lead.

Back in the day, your uncle's nickname was Moose.
Wow, what a coincidence, because Bullwinkle's nickname is Phil.
Hey, Moose, remember spring fling and Betty Webber?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- Stuey Baker, Stuey Baker.

God, so great to see you.
- Yeah, good to see you too.
- Hey, you know what?
That's really funny to me that you're opening an L.A. office.
- Yeah.
Yup.
- Get the heck out of here.
Hey, you know, because actually I live in L.A. and I'm not averse to working in an office.
- Oh, all right.
- Carlton Banks, sir.
I hear you have a job opening and I'm a 3.8 student.
Actually, he's being a little modest.
Carlton, come on, he's at least 4 feet.
But, seriously, about this job, man.
Yeah, well, I'm looking for some bright, young person to bring into my new office.
That is if I can open up a factory here.
I mean, Councilman Braddock has been hassling me about a zoning permit.
Councilman Braddock, I work with him and he's a tough cookie.
Speaking of cookies, I've been running the campus restaurant Right into the ground.
Uh Heh.
But if you were looking for someone who's about to get married so is therefore more prepared to make a long-term commitment you might wanna choose This in-debt, unreliable busboy whose only asset Okay, boys, boys, that's enough.
Hey, no, no, no, it's okay.
I like that competitive spirit.
Yeah, it looks like I got two good candidates for my internship.
- Internship?
- Yeah.
As in non-paying job?
Well, yeah.
Good to meet you, Ernest.
Hey, Will, if you're still interested, the job is yours.
What do you say?
I love this guy.
Geoffrey, tonight's the night I meet Brown Sugar, my sweet soul sister.
Well, you're half right.
Hah!
Master Carlton there is something you should know before you go out on your date.
Oh, please, you're giving me advice about a date.
The last time you had a date, Dad had a Jheri curl.
What could you possibly have to tell me?
Have a lovely time.
Thanks.
Carlton Banks.
You're gonna have to speak up, I can't hear you.
I said I'm calling you from my new cellular phone.
Mr. Big Shot on his cell phone.
Will, that's a pretty cheap piece of equipment.
All I'm getting is static.
Speak up.
- Is this better?
- Ow!
Oh, Carlton, man, I got to tell you, this is the job of my dreams.
No wait, let me change that.
This is the job of your dreams.
Aah!
What are you talking about?
Man, you know, God, I just I really don't think there's any need for me to rub it in, you know.
Excuse me, that was a Visa.
Oh.
That's an American Express.
I think that was a Diner's Club.
Gosh, you know, I'm gonna have to have them turn down the air conditioning in my little corner office.
If you think you're getting to me, think again.
Look, sour grapes is just not my kind of fruit.
He's walking, he's walking.
He's outside now.
He stops, picks a little flower.
Walks a little farther around the corner, he looks up and he sees  the company Porsche.
Whoo-hoo.
Life is good.
Hey, hey.
Brought your Porsche back for you, Mr. James.
Mr. James, is my father here?
No, sir, no sir.
I mean, Ernie.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
You know, it starts to pull a little to the left at about 90.
Uh Says the manual.
Tell you what, Will, you're a part of the company now why don't you just hang on to the keys, huh?
Okey-doke.
- For real?
- Yeah.
Man, look, you keep treating me this good, I'm gonna have to start calling you "Pops.
"  Hey, listen, on your way home I need you to take this to Councilman Braddock.
Now, I wouldn't just let anybody handle this but, see, I trust you, Will.
Well, it's a good thing too, because if I wanted to open it these little locks sure wouldn't stop me.
Oh, but I think they would.
Oh, no, man, I know brothers in Philly, all they got to do Whoo!
Ow!
Ow!
Whoo!
Ooh!
Ooh, ooh!
Ooh.
What money?
I did not see no money.
I did not see no money.
I didn't see a dime, nothing.
- No, no, no.
Hey, it's okay.
- I mean, I ain't seen this.
I looked the other way when it popped.
Hey, take it easy, hold it, now, just take it easy.
Hey, Will, I tell you what, I tell you what, Will.
Uh Why don't you sit down, Will.
Yeah.
You look troubled, son.
Troubled?
No, man, you know, I mean Why would I be troubled?
You know, because, I mean I'm sure there's a legitimate reason you're sending a briefcase full of money to a councilman that controls your business interest, man.
Well, can we just say it's a birthday present, huh?
Yes, we could.
Yeah, yeah, we could say that.
Because that's what I had thought, you know.
I figured that's what it was, you know.
I didn't see no party hats, no Heeh!
in there.
Do you mind if I sit down?
You are sitting down.
Thank you.
Look Um Listen, I don't think that I'll be able to make your little delivery for you, Mr. James.
See Uh Ooh.
Pshh.
They had called me.
From Because the other time you know, remember the car had skid and then because it had rained.
I'll just go ahead, okay?
Oh, oh, oh.
Not so fast, Will.
I'm not gonna let you leave this office No!
No!
Oh, no!
No!
Hey, what are you gonna do?
until I give you this bonus.
Yeah.
I just want you to know how much I value your work around here.
Whoo.
Heh.
- That much, huh?
- Yeah.
- More money, more money, more money.
- Yeah, yeah.
And just saying you're You know, you're about to be married.
And I'm sure you can use it.
Look, um, I don't know, man.
You know Hey, I haven't earned it.
Oh, but you will.
Yeah, you will.
Now, here.
Now, take this.
Okay?
And grab the briefcase here.
All right, and run along.
Okay, son?
- All right.
- Yeah.
- I'll go ahead.
- Okay.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
Straight to hell.
I'm so excited.
Tonight I finally meet my mystery man.
This much happiness should be illegal.
I believe it is.
Brown Sugar, here I come.
Why, what have we here?
Ha.
It's 1995, Geoffrey.
When a fella goes on a date, he better carry protection.
Sani-Seat.
Oh, and I'm also bringing my secret weapon.
That's right, Tony Orlando with Dawn.
- Will?
- What money?
Will, what's that under your jacket?
Huh?
Oh, it's nothing.
You know, it's just a little, old briefcase.
You know, but it's not really important, because there ain't nothing in it, you know.
Will, as soon as you stop clowning around, I need to ask you a question.
If I kissed you on the first date would you blush and giggle or knee me in the groin?
I'd knee you in the groin, then I'd blush and giggle.
Now, get away from me.
- G, where's Uncle Phil?
- Follow the Ding Dong debris.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
- I need to talk to you about Ernest.
- Oh, okay.
He asked me to deliver this to Councilman Braddock.
Well - Oh, my God.
- I know, it flipped me too.
Councilman Braddock is a Tony Orlando and Dawn fan.
He should be run out of office.
Will, what is the problem?
Oh, my Carlton.
G, where's Carlton at?
He left for Chez Lani Restaurant to meet his dream date.
Oh, man, he's made a terrible mistake.
Heh.
You don't know the half of it.
- Hilary?
- Carlton, what are you doing here?
I'm meeting my date.
- Wait a minute, what are you doing here?
- I'm meeting my date.
What a small world.
Now, get away.
Hershey's Kiss should be here any minute.
Hershey's Kiss?
Oh, for crying out loud, Hilary, I'm Hershey's Kiss.
You too?
Well, what are the odds?
Hilary, work with me here.
I'm Hershey's Kiss, you're Brown Sugar, we're here to date each other.
What are you saying?
I'm dating my own sister.
Is my favorite country Western song.
Oy.
I brought all this babe bait for nothing.
Well, just because we're related doesn't mean we can't have dinner.
- This is my money.
What are you doing?
- Let go.
Come on.
Hey, would you guys stop it?
Carlton, you took my briefcase by mistake.
Give it back.
Oh, forget it, finders keepers.
All right, all right.
Would you just stop it.
Stop it.
Now, would you two get a grip.
Now.
Hilary, get off it.
Get off it, get off it.
Stop it.
Stop.
Now, I gotta go show this to Uncle Phil.
Uh One more thing, y'all two dating?
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Where the hell have you been?
Ernest just called and he was very upset.
You were supposed to make a very important delivery.
I got it right here.
Right here is not where it's supposed to be.
All right, look, Uncle Phil, first of all, I'm quitting that job.
- Let me tell you, man, this dude, he - Hey, hold on, hold on, you're quitting?
After just three days?
I can't believe this.
- If you would just listen - No, you listen.
This is not just another one of your little screwups, Will.
You're jeopardizing my friendship with Ernest.
Right, but Uncle Phil, what I'm trying to say-- No, no, listen to me, okay?
Look, I don't have a lot of close friends.
So if you're going to quit, I want to know why.
All right, Uncle Phil I'd rather not say.
I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't even begin to describe you.
Hey, Phillip.
- Am I interrupting something?
- Nothing you don't already know.
I'm just having a little discussion with Will about this situation.
Oh, well, look, now, let's not overreact.
Okay?
No, look, as far as I'm concerned, there's no excuse.
I think some kind of disciplinary action is in order.
Hey, lighten up.
It was only $20,000 in there.
These days that's hardly enough to even be considered a bribe.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, look, look.
If it's your nephew you're worried about, forget it.
It's not like he delivered it.
Yeah, that's right.
And your bonus is in there, and the keys to your little filthy Porsche.
And if my drawers wasn't so dirty, I'd snatch this suit and give it to you too.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
What are you doing, Ernie?
Hey, I tell you what the brother's doing.
I'll tell you later.
I'll just write it down.
Oh, now, come on, Moose.
Now, you know the way of the world.
You can't name me one man who's become a success without bending the law.
Oh, yes, I can.
Me.
Until now.
Now, you take this and get out of my house.
Hey, even if he would have gotten caught, it wouldn't have been that bad.
Oh, yes, it would have been that bad for you.
Now, get out.
You were always so damn naive.
That's right.
You best to press off or you'll get straight molly whopped up in here.
I should have wrote that one down too, right?
Look, I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
No, no, Will, I apologize to you.
I know that was your boy and everything.
Hey, listen, I know exactly how you feel.
It's just like when I found out that Kermit the Frog was just a piece of green felt with somebody's hand up his butt.
Something like that, son.
Good night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Uncle Phil, come on, man, come on.
The night is still young.
- Hey, come on, come on.
- I don't feel like this, Will.
THE TEMPTATIONS : I know you want to leave me But I refuse to let you go If I have to beg And plead for your sympathy I don't mind 'Cause you mean that much to me Come on, Moose, let that caboose loose.
If I have to beg And plead for your sympathy You stupid.
Ha-ha.
- Please don't leave me, girl  Don't you go
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Wait, sorry.
Ugh.
Carlton, the customers are complaining there ain't no bacon in the BLT's.
Well, where's the law that says the B has to stand for bacon?
Read the damn sign.
Bread, lettuce and tomato?
Well, we had to cut back somewhere.
Last month, our outlay exceeded our revenues.
But I don't expect you to understand that.
Ahem.
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?
Excuse me, Carlton, but a beautiful woman wants to talk to me.
But I don't expect you to understand that.
How you doing?
What can I do for you?
Well, heh, I'm doing this crossword puzzle and I'm kind of stuck.
What's a nine-letter word for incredible?
Oh, that's easy.
- Will Smith.
- Heh.
Denise, a pleasure to meet you.
Hey.
Of all the campus dames in all the campuses in all the world why'd you have to walk into mine?
Casablanca, right?
I love Humphrey Bogart.
Yeah, yeah, dude is cool.
He ain't no Shaft, though, you know?
- Damn right.
- Damn right.
Whoa!
Look at you.
You know, most women can't appreciate the subtle nuances of a fine Shaft film.
Yes, well, I'm not like most women.
You got that right.
What are you thinking right now?
WILL : You ain't wearing no bra.
So do you like the Pointer Sisters?
- No, no.
- Oh, wait.
Don't talk to me about the Lakers.
I'm a Sixers fan all the way.
- Oh, get the!
- Yeah.
I should be, I just moved here from Philly.
What?
Wait, girl.
You are scaring me.
I'm from Philly.
- Get the!
- Yeah.
Well, that explains the attraction.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Let's put it to a little test here.
What you like, B-ball or football?
Round ball, of course.
Oh, okay.
Convertibles or 4-by-4?
Nothing beats an off-road vehicle.
Oh, okay.
Here's the one here.
Potatoes or Stove Top?
Potatoes.
Oh, girl.
Look at you, you are just like me.
Except, you know, a little softer and you smell better.
All right, all right, okay, now it's my turn to ask you a question.
Oh, bring it on, I ain't scared of you.
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.
You wanna do something tonight?
I sure do.
Oh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
I am sorry.
Uh Lis I have what you might call a prior engagement.
Uh Uh Oh, and plus, you gotta finish your crossword puzzle and everything anyway.
Well, just one left to go.
What's a six-letter word that comes at the end of the rhyme: Miss me, miss me Now you gotta - Kiss me.
- I'd love to.
Carlton, being attracted to someone isn't a crime.
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Why are you asking me?
I ain't never been never attracted to nobody in my whole life.
Will, I wasn't talking about you.
I'm seeing this guy and he's so beautiful.
He's got great eyes and a great chest.
Will you stop it?
I mean, is that all you women think about is eyes and chests and butts?
I wasn't thinking about his butt.
Hey, I am now.
Hey, Uncle Phil, what's up, man?
Look, we need to talk.
Oh, we do?
Come on, Uncle Phil, look, you know I love Lisa.
I wanna be with her 24/7, you know?
Yeah, well, I'm with you so far.
But every once in a while it's kind of like the Civil War.
You know, the North got everything under control but every once in a while, it's a Southern uprising.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, I understand, see, but you have to remember that the North has right on its side so you better be damn sure that it wins the war.
Uncle Phil, look, I'm trying, man but I got the feeling that the South shall rise again.
And you know, I don't even know if it's fair to marry Lisa.
- You know, during wartime.
- Oh, oh.
Will, look, you're always gonna find other women attractive.
It's how you handle it that will determine whether your marriage is a success or a failure.
Oh, wait, don't get me wrong, Uncle Phil, once I say I do, I don't.
Oh, if it were only that simple.
Son, observe and learn.
Now, you're walking down Rodeo Drive.
You be Vivi.
Okay.
Oh, come on, pudding, jeez you pushing me all off the sidewalk.
- Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Would you please be my wife?
Now, okay?
Now, we're walking.
We're walking.
Ooh Beautiful woman walks right on by.
Looks just Diahann Carroll.
Ah Phillip.
What, Vivian?
I was looking at that woman.
I mean, she's gorgeous, but she doesn't do a thing for me.
Baby, what is it that you have that she doesn't?
A mean left hook.
Oh, come on.
I apologize.
I was just playing, Uncle Phil.
You're right, I see your point.
Ain't that the truth.
But you don't push your luck because you're just a beginner.
If Toni Braxton walked by, you just put on your sunglasses.
Oh, man, I don't need none of that stuff.
I got it completely under control.
I don't care if Toni girl goes galloping by on a white horse buck-naked, you know?
She better be traveling fast, though.
Snatch her little butt down off there.
Yeah.
Guess who?
Hey, hey.
How's it going?
How you doing?
Good to see you.
Hey, take those off, I can't see those sexy eyes.
Uh It's a rare condition.
Day blindness.
You know, they're really sensitive.
Wanna go to my place and turn off all the lights?
Hey.
Denise listen, I gotta be straight with you.
I am really, really flattered.
I mean, look at you, you're beautiful.
Look at those sexy dimples and those beautiful cheeks.
And then there's your face.
What's the problem?
Well, I sort of have this, uh, fiancée.
So who's the lucky lady?
Her name is Lisa, but listen, I'm the lucky one.
I mean, she's great.
She's beautiful, she's brilliant and she got a 4.0 in biology.
Sounds like you really love her.
Oh, yeah, I love her.
Of course I do.
I have to.
We're engaged.
Well, I can't say I'm not disappointed.
Look, Denise believe me, if this was one year ago, girl, I would be all over you.
You know what I'm saying?
All over you.
You hear that?
Yeah, I know, only too well.
- Hey, baby.
- I was just talking!
To who?
Uh To myself.
Yeah.
You know, I do that sometimes.
Don't you?
Yeah, yeah, you do.
You do.
I was just talking.
Baby, I wanted to talk to you about a shower.
Oh, I've thought about that, but it probably won't help.
I meant a wedding shower.
Some of my sorority sisters wanna throw one for us this Saturday at the Hyatt.
Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhearing from where I was eavesdropping but why pay hotel prices when you could have the party at our house for free?
Ah.
Heh.
Hey, that's decent, C. And I can get you a great deal on the mandatory catering.
Hey, people are talking about our peacock pupu platter.
People are talking about you too, but that don't mean they want you at their party.
I make a tuna pÃ¢té to die for.
Or from.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hold up a second there, Chef-Boy-Are-You-Short.
Okay, see you later, babe.
Excuse me, do you know where the administration building is?
I'm new here and the campus is so confusing.
This whole city is confusing.
I remember when I first moved here from Cleveland You're from Cleveland?
So am I. You're kidding.
- Lisa.
- Denise.
- Gosh, I'll walk you right over.
Come on.
- Great.
Oh, look out, Yogi.
Kevin, could we turn this off a while and talk?
Okay.
Hey, you wanna see my Boo Boo?
- Oh, did you hurt yourself?
- No, my Boo Boo.
"Yogi I don't think the ranger's gonna like that.
" Are you thirsty?
Yeah, sometimes.
No, Kevin, I mean Come on.
Will, Lisa, this is Kevin.
Oh, hey.
Kev, what's up, man?
I don't know.
Hey, you're not exactly splitting atoms either, okay?
Baby, will you get the brown sugar, please?
- Oh, sure thing, sweetheart.
- Whoa.
Whoa!
Baby.
Oh, hey, Uncle Phil, what's up, man?
You know, I cannot thank you enough for the, uh, little history lesson.
Oh.
Oh, so there was a test?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I admit, I peeked over a couple of shoulders and I liked what I saw but I did not cheat.
- Ah Good for you, son.
All right.
I thought you took all your tests.
Oh, uh, it was an unexpected oral exam.
Yeah.
But you know what, baby?
I passed and it's out of my life forever, so let's have a beautiful night.

Modest too.
What a catch.

Baby, I'll help him.
Oh, no, baby, stay and give Denise a hand.
No, no, no, I should keep my hands to myself.

Unless, of course, you want me to.
Hey.
Girl, stop it.
- My fiancée is right in the other room.

Oh, what wonderful gifts.

Keep the receipts.
Oh, thank you, everybody.
Oh, Denise, thank you so much for coming.
Thanks for having me.
Listen, I hate to ask, but my ride only dropped me off so I'm kind of stuck.

Will.

Lisa's so sweet and so trusting.
I can't believe that I came on to you.
Yeah.
Bad Denise.
Bad Denise.
You think I don't know that?
I feel like such a fool.
Hey.
Come on, come on, don't cry.

Wouldn't you cry if you threw yourself at someone and they didn't even care?
Well, only if I missed and hit the wall.

I'll be fine, really.
Okey-dokey, cozy.

What is that, satin?
Silk.

Could you see?
Thank you.
Keep the car.
Lisa, baby Look, Lisa, something happened between me and Denise but, baby, I swear to you that nothing like this will ever happen again.
Baby, you got to believe me.
I love you.
I want you to be my wife.
Wait, G, G. Hold it.
Listen.
Um, ahem.
I need to talk to you.
I kind of betrayed Lisa's trust.
And I don't know what to do.
Might I venture an opinion, young sir?
You and Miss Lisa are about to embark on a lifelong journey together and you cannot hope to remain on course unless honesty is your North Star.
Wow.
You know, that's deep, G. - Hey, where'd you get that?
- Popeye.
Oh, dude got skills.
Hey, G, you know what?
You are right, man.
I'm gonna tell Lisa, from now on, the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Good luck.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
What did you need to talk about that was so important?
Look, Lisa All right, baby, listen.
I love you.
Oh Will.
Like, I'm gonna listen to Geoffrey.
When's the last time you seen him with a woman?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Well, I got a pair of eights.
Ah.
Sorry about that, bro, I got a Dolly Parton.
- What's that?
- A bigger pair.
Whaa!
Will, I've got a surprise for your bachelor party.
I booked the penthouse suite at the LaPeer Hotel.
Really?
Oh, man, I could just kiss you.
I could just kiss you too.
But perhaps my time would be better spent learning a talent.
Hey, he isn't making calls on your bachelor party, is he?
I mean, that's my job.
I mean, you have told him that I'm the best man?
Uh See, what had happened At first, but then he had called Will, go tell him.
Tsk.
Next time I'm gonna let Jazz kiss you.
Hey, Jazz, listen, we need to talk, man.
Yes, we do.
The Strip 'N Trip wanna know if the hotel will furnish extension cords?
And tell Naughty Nelvina and The Naked Drill Team to wear coats or they'll never get past hotel security.
Okay.
- What was it you wanted to talk about?
- You're the best, man.
Now, are you positive you can't see anything?
Yes, I am positive.
Super.
Ow!
How could I miss that big square head of yours?
Look, come on, Will.
I've spent a lot of time decorating for your bachelor party.
I just want it to be a surprise.
Oh, no, not another Scooby-Doo piñata.
Pssh.
I wish.
No offense, Scrappy but it's hard to top the parties I've been to.
CROWD : Go, Will.
Go, Will.
Go, Will.
Go, Will.
Go, Will.
Go, Will.
Girl, I'm sure glad we got rid of that nut.
Ah.
You can't hang, can you, baby?
What do you two think you're doing?
I was trying to get up to my room.
Hey, Tom, what was you doing?
I was trying to be in the video.
- Man, this party is dull.
- No, man, this party is stupid.
No, no, no, this party is crazy, flat, dumb, dumb, doodie.
You're the man.
You're the man.
- You're the man.
- You're the man.
Ahhh!
You just wait.
I've set you up with one heck of a wingding, Will.
You won't regret making me the best man.
D'oh!
Oh, yes.
Um That's one little thing I wanted to talk to you about, see.
What?
You know, being best man does have its perks.
That was it.
C. Jazz is the best man?
Then what the heck am I?
Short.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.
Now, you guys are both my best men.
Carlton, you're the best man for the wedding.
And Jazz is the best man for getting the talent for the bachelor party.
Tsk.
Ugh.
He got me Rolanda, the Rubber Lady.
Look, I'll have you know that Stan, the world's smartest duck was this close to getting on Leno.
What the heck does  supposed to mean?
Listen, this is no time to fight, all right?
You're right, my brother.
Tonight, we salute the passing of one of the greats.
Ah.
Yeah, let's have a moment of silence for all the girls that have found me irresistible.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, Jean-Claude Van Damme, I'm fine.
You are my man.
Amen.
Do you like it?
Wow.
I love it.
All right, now take it off.
You know, if somebody was to walk in here right now they might think you was hitting on me.
Trust me, if I was hitting on you, you'd know It.
Really?
How?
Okay, you made your point.
Hey, you're not the only one who had to fight off the women, bub.
This is Tina.
Tina, this is my brother, Carlton.
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi.
I love your towel.
Thanks.
Well, I gotta go prepare for the debate practice.
You're on the debate team?
That is so cool.
Which one of these losers is my date?
That would be me.
This is my cousin, Carlton.
Where's the rest of him?
I may be short, but you know what they say about short men and tall women, don't you?
No.
What?
I don't know, just making conversation.
Hey, small stuff, you wanna come back here and check out the rest of my merchandise?
How can anybody with a sorry list like that be the best man?
That's it.
We're staying right here until you decide who is your best man.
Look, Carlton, would you stop playing?
Now, move.
Minimart here is right, who's it gonna be?
Me or him?
You know what?
In one minute, y'all two can Jell-O wrestle for the title, okay?
Okay.
Man, didn't your mothers ever tell you, don't play with buttons?
Hello.
They can't hear you, bro.
The music's too loud.
Can I throw a party or what?
I don't believe this.
There's a python and some triplets in there and I'm stuck in here with Ren and Stumpy.
Come on, guy, cheer up.
They'll have us out of here in an hour, tops.
We're out of food.
We're out of water.
I mean, how long can we survive like this?
We've only been in here for five minutes, Carlton.
Get a grip.
Get off of me.
Let's just relax.
I've been in plenty worse situations than this.
Trust me.
Earthquake!
Baby, it was just a little earthquake.
Babe, listen.
Listen, no.
The ground moved, okay?
The ground.
The ground moved.
Nobody was bothering it, it just moved, all right?
But it's over now and we're fine.
I am not fine, all right?
I'm a grown man sitting under the table, hugging a teddy bear.
I'm not fine.
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter?
My water broke.
That's cool, we got another one right here in the fridge.
And Dougie is a barn dog.
Unbelievable.
Will Smith apologizing.
My sisters, welcome the newest member of Kappa Phi Gamma, Lisa Wilkes.
All right.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Y'all going to leave me hanging up here like a piece of Rotisserie Gold, huh?
Take my baby girl to Palm Springs?
Oh, you done it now, boy.
- I'm really mad now.
- No.
Uh-oh.
The engine's dead.
What?
Yeah.
Oh, so I guess we're going down, huh?
Faster than a bucket of chicken at Oprah's.
Oh, so I should probably just confess all the nasty things I've done with your daughter, huh?
Especially seeing as how, in any second now we're gonna be splattering all over those mountains there.
Let me tell you.
I'm from Philly.
You got to wake up early in the morning to get me with some old Mr. Adams?
Mr. Adams?
Mr. Adams?
And I came out of that without a scratch.
So just calm down, all right?
Shh.
Listen.
I know that sound anywhere.
- What sound?
- A Wonderbra hitting the floor.
Let me out!
Let me out!
This is all your fault, you finger-licking ragamuffin.
Who are you calling muffin, Little Debbie?
All right, all right, stop it.
Stop it.
Come on, ain't no time to Tootsie Roll, fool.
Fight like a man.
All right, guys, guys.
Nobody move.
- Ahh - Choo!
We stopped.
We stopped!
It's a miracle!
Wow, gravity.
What a rush.
Hello, elevator repairman.
We don't have time to chat.
We're stuck in here.
Shut up, Jazz.
That's the elevator repairman.
Help!
Just stay calm.
We'll get you out of there.
Can't guarantee it'll be in one piece.
Yeah, I'd rather be anybody but myself right now.
Well, it certainly wouldn't be the first time.
Okay, now, just remember you're from Connecticut and you transferred to Bel-Air Academy and you row on the crew team.
Now, where did you transfer from?
- Bend over.
- It's Andover.
We're going back home.
Ah.
Mr. Banks, did you forget something?
You know, I'm glad you asked.
I forgot to give you the number to my direct line.
Look, I'm very flattered, but I You know, that is an absolutely intoxicating fragrance that you're wearing.
Come closer.
Hey.
That's a fake mustache.
No, it's not.
Ah!
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I'm calling your real parents right now.
Will.
No, it's not.
Is that fat guy following us?
What fat guy?
Come on.
Is there some reason why you're following us?
- Will?
- Well, it ain't Fat Albert.
We've been in here for hours, man.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Look, at least you got a chance to live life to it's fullest.
I only had one woman.
One.
I don't want this to end.
It doesn't have to.
Will you marry me?
You are too adorable for words.
Can I give you a kiss goodbye?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning.
Well, what time should I come back?
My life has been so pathetic.
No, it hasn't.
Well, yeah, it has.
Who cares?
It's over.
When the elevator was falling and I thought we were gonna die your life flashed before my eyes.
If I only had your magic with the women.
Come on, Carlton, all these years, man, haven't you caught on?
I mean, half the battle is the lyrics you toss at the honeys.
Girl, you look good, I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of y'all.
Girl, I got to tell you.
That suit look like a piece of good God, wrapped up with some have mercy with a side of oomph!
I've seen your picture before.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
It was in the dictionary next to "ka-blam"!
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Mm.
Well, I'm hoping you like it dark, hot sweet and with a spoon in It.
Look, miss, I'd just like to apologize on behalf of my gender for his rude behavior.
That's okay.
No, it's not.
He had no reason to act like that.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Look, could I call you sometime?
Yeah, call me.
Thank you.
Yo, baby, I know your feet must be tired because you've been running through my mind all day!
Oh, come, come my brother you don't always leave the party with a favor.
- I didn't come here from Philly to hear - Oh, it's gonna happen.
I am tired of you.
Get out of my face!
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- You need to shut up!
You know what?
- You ain't never gonna change.
- You ain't never gonna change.
- Give me the last word.
- Give me the last word.
- You're not.
- You're not.
- Yes, I am.
- Yes, I am.
- Damn.
- Damn.
Yeah, sure, bring up the one time that a woman walks away from me.
- One time?
- One time?
Hold, hold, hold it, baby.
See, now, I noticed you noticing me.
So I just want to put you on notice that I noticed you too.
And?
And to let you know that I might consider letting you be with me.
Is that what passes for a compliment around here?
- Listen.
- You listen.
If you want a shot with me maybe you should try talking to me like a human being, okay?
Got it?
Actually, baby, you got it, but I take donations.
She tied a pork chop around your neck just so the dog would play with you.
Well, you so ugly, your mama had to feed you with a slingshot.
You're so ugly, that ain't a fade on your head that's your hair running away from your face.
Now, you know that Hank Farley is not your type.
Strip away the shoulder pads and the muscles and the dimples and what you got?
- You.
Does this look like a place to have fun?
I don't think so.
Ain't nobody going to have no fun up in here.
Not me, not you, not her.
And definitely not me.
Goodbye, Will.
Whoa, baby, come back here.
What is her name?
Oh, no, no, no.
Carlton.
Carlton, man, I'm sorry about all those short jokes.
You know, it really took a big man to handle it and, well, you tried your best, okay?
I love you, man.
I love you too, Will.
You too, man.
Somebody give me some love.
Please.
We're going up.
We're gonna live.
I'm gonna have one more chance to do the wild thing.
Get off me.
Whew.
The guest of honor is in the house.
Party over here.
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey, good evening, Master William.
Absolutely bumping party.
Oh, yeah, thanks a lot, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey?
But you told me your name was Will.
No, I said I was willing.
Hold the elevator.
- Uh-oh.
Going down.
No, no.
Help!
Oh, my poor baby.
Your whole life must have flashed before your eyes.
- Kiss me.
- I'd love to.
Hello.
Not really.
- All I could think about was you.
- Aww.
Mm.

Mr. Frederick Wilkes requests the honor of your presence at the marriage of his daughter Lisa to Mr. William Smith on Saturday, the 20th day of May at 11:00.
Whoo-hoo!
Check it out.
Two days before the wedding and we already got gifts.
I got to marry Lisa more often.
- Wow, this is just like Christmas.
- Well, ho, ho, ho.
Oh, man.

Something that has to be returned.
Oh, lookie here, lookie here.
All these cute little money-sized envelopes.
Oh, oh.
Boom-ba-yah!
Whoo!
My favorite wedding guest.
Ben Franklin.
Oh, excuse me, Ben.
Allow me to show you to your seat.
The wedding's in 48 hours so I need your final decision on the centerpiece.
Sweetheart roses or baby tulips?

- Tulips.
- Roses.
Can't you two ever agree on anything?
We can always agree on Oh, rent a room.
So did pops-in-law settle in yet?
Yes, he did.
Baby, do you think that my dad is gonna get along with your mom?
I don't know.
Can he take a punch?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
No, seriously, can he?
That's cool, baby.
Come here, come here.
Get off of me, woman!
Come on.
What would your daddy say?
He'd say, you ain't fooling nobody.
Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, baby.
What's up?
How was your flight from Cleveland?
It was terrible.
I got stuck next to this battleaxe who kept trying to steal my blanket when I fell asleep.
Oh, man, I know how you feel.
Lisa do that to me all the time.
Man, just last night, we Did you hear that?
Just In the other room.
Did you?
- You wait here.
We gonna go and check.
- Yeah.
Baby.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just practicing for the honeymoon night.
Yo, bellhop!
If the room be bopping, don't you be knocking.
Surprise.
Hey, Ma.
- Baby.
How you doing?
- What are you doing here already?
She wanted to come a day early to surprise you.
But my flight was a disaster.
When I changed planes in Cleveland they sat me next to this loudmouth chunky butt who fell asleep on my shoulder.
Then when I tried to move him, he had the nerve to call me a battleaxe and say I stole his blanket.
- You!
- You!
Hey, hey.
Chunky butt, meet battleaxe.
Battleaxe, chunky butt.
I don't care what you say, Hilary.
I am not wearing this disgusting bridesmaid's dress.
Oh, but, Ashley, you look adorable.
Right, Will?
Oh, yeah.
You look like a chocolate-flavored Pepto-Bismol.
That settles it.
I am not wearing this dress unless I can have a matching bag.
- No problem.
- To put over my head.
Ashley!
Okay.
Come on, Ike and Tina, let's go.
All right.
Now, listen.
You guys go ahead to the restaurant you hold the table.
Lisa and I will catch up in a minute.
And, Mom, could you try to be nice?
I always am, dear.
Okay, tubby, tuck in your gut, we're going downtown.
In Philly, "tubby" mean cute bald man.
Just don't be late.
You might find her face-down in the crab cake.
I don't know what he's complaining about.
I like my women scrappy.
G, check this out.
Me and Lisa ain't even going to the restaurant.
If we leave them there by themselves they'll have to work out their differences.
- Sounds like a plan, right?
Will you wait till I get in the car?
I didn't say it was a good plan.
- Greetings, my brother.
- Yo, what up, J?
Pssh.
What's up, man?
Just doing a little packing here for my honeymoon.
Oh, J, J. Daywear.
Night wear.
Oh, man.
You took your gold tooth out.
What's the occasion?
The wife and I are split up.
Inconsolable differences.
Oh, Jazz.
I'm sorry, man.
What happened?
Marriage, my brother.
The minute the ring went on, the mask came off.
And so did the weave.
I realized I married a perfect stranger.
And tomorrow it'll happen to you too.
Oh, no, man, trust.
I know the woman I'm about to marry.
That's what I thought.
Soon after, I realized I didn't know Hortense at all.
Hortense?
Jazz, I thought her name was Jewel.
Just one of her many lies.
Man, I found out she slept with every guy in my building.
She had sex with all of them?
She did?
Man, it just gets worse and worse.
Jazz, I'm real sorry about you and Hortense but trust me, I know my woman.
Better than I know the back of my own hand.
What the hell is that?
- Hi.
- See?
I knew she was gonna say that.
Hi, Jazz.
Well we haven't heard from our folks.
They must be getting along.
Or one of them's dead and one of them's a fugitive.
Well, I gotta run.
Hortense took the car in the settlement.
At least she ain't got no weave.
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.
Jazz just messing with me.
Talking about I don't know my baby.
Like how much you love sweet potato pie.
Baby, I hate sweet potato pie.
You playing, right, girl?
You so silly.
No, next you gonna be telling me you ain't love Shaft in Africa.
I don't.
You sat through it like nine times.
For you, baby.
But personally, I think the guy's a lowlife slug whose whole sexual identity is an extension of his big, stupid gun.
Anything else?
- I think he's gay.
- Ah!
Ah!
Will, what is wrong with you?
One more thing.
Your name is Lisa, isn't it?
Well, it is now.
I just couldn't go through life hearing people say, "Hey, Beula.
" Well, I'm gonna finish packing and, baby, I'll see you at the altar.
Bye, Beula.
Who is it?
Hey, Mom.
I know it's late, but I really need to talk.
Mamma, no!
Will.
Will.
You, him, here.
I need a moment.
I'm an adult.
I can handle this.
I'm okay.
Mamma, no!
Will, will you keep it down?
I'm not ready to talk to you yet, young man.
What happened?
I heard screaming.
What's this, a pajama party?
Hey, scooch over.
What is going on?
Ew.
Hey.
Okay, that's it.
Everybody out.
Everybody out.
Move it, Ashley.
- Right now.
Everybody.
Come on.
Okay, Mom, I just wanna say that I am hurt.
And I don't think that mothers are supposed to do what Oh, my God, I just got a mental picture!
Get out!
Get out!
Good morning, baby.
- Listen, Mom, about last night I know, sweetheart.
And I hope I didn't spoil your wedding day.
No, Mom, that's what I wanna talk to you about.
We gonna be moving to the church.
You're right.
You know, I need to find my earrings.
Oh, I know where they are, baby, You left them on top of my Maya Angelou's book of poetry.
Come on, I'll show you where they are.
Y'all, don't miss the wedding.
Look, Aunt Viv, you got a second?
- I really - Oh, Nicky!
Lord, come on.
I gotta go upstairs and get you straightened up.
Come on.
All right, Uncle Phil, I need to talk to somebody!
- I'm listening.
- All right, maybe later.
I said I was listening.
But I got a million things to do, so hurry.
Okay, okay, cool.
Remember when you said we was too young to get married?
When I told you mind your business, I know what I'm doing?
You remember how wrong I always am?
Will, I know you're nervous.
It's perfectly normal.
Every man gets cold feet.
It's coded in our DNA.
I'll tell you what you do.
You're gonna be fine.
Go in there, say I do, be done with it.
Feel better?
- Well - Good.
Okay.
Posse out, let's go.
Daddy, I need your checkbook.
Hey, Nick, you got a second, man?
This wedding stuff is really stressing me out.
Tell me about it.
I've got to balance a ring on a stupid pillow.
- Hey, you wanna talk about it?
- No.
Oh, Lisa.
This dress looks almost as beautiful on you as it would on me.
Thanks, Hilary.
I need to talk to my wife.
Well, to be.
Her.
Forget it, Will.
You can't see her before the wedding.
It's bad luck.
Well, I'll risk it.
It's important.
Well, make it fast.
If I start to frizz, you're a dead man.
Congratulations!
- Baby.
- Baby?
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Will, what's wrong?
You know, this is really hard without looking at you.
Hey, hey, girl!
This ain't no time to be getting freaky.
Will, I was trying to hold your hand.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that wasn't it.
Babe, listen I've been kind of, you know, having doubts.
What kind of doubts, Will?
Just tiny little nagging, constant doubts in the pit of my stomach, you know?
It's like, we so different.
I mean, look, it's just that you seem so sure of yourself, you know?
And so sure about us.
And I'm scared.
I guess this, like, ain't the best time to be telling you this.
No, no, baby, I'm really happy that you did because I've been scared too.
- Really?
I thought I was alone in this.
Why you ain't tell me, girl?
I don't know.
I guess for the same reasons you didn't tell me.
I can't tell you how good it feels to know I can tell you anything.
- Now I know we gonna be all right.
- Yeah.
I love you, baby.
Well, this is it.
It's all she wrote.
Last chance for gas.
Last train to Clarksville.
Last of the Mohicans.
You know, as hard as this is to believe, I'm gonna miss you.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
Let us pray.
Dear heavenly father, we ask that as Will and Lisa commit their lives to one another, you will strengthen and encourage them and guide them in their day-to-day trials and triumphs of life.
In your name we pray.
Amen.
Amen.
Now, if anyone can show just cause why Will and Lisa should not be joined together let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
William, do you take Beula Lisa Wilkes to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Yes, I Whoo!
do.
But I don't.
Will, I'm sorry, but I think if we both have doubts about this whole thing Wait, wait, no, had.
We had doubts.
Remember, babe?
We talked about it.
We both feel better.
No, baby, you feel better.
But I think we're making a really big mistake.
And if you think about it, you will too.
No.
No, Lisa I really love you.
Will, I love you too, but I think our parents might be right.
I think maybe we just rushed into this thing too fast.
Well Well, I guess we shouldn't get married, then, should we?
Not today.
Hey, looks like we finally agree on something.
Yeah.
Lisa and I would like to thank you all for coming today but ain't nobody gonna be jumping over no brooms in here.
Well, save it for that 50 pounds of shrimp swimming around on that damn ice swan.
Not so fast, Will.
Vy, I always thought that a man only got one chance at happiness.
And then I met you.
We met at 10,000 feet in the air.
And I promise you, baby, if you marry me neither of us will ever come down.
Vy will you be my wife?
- Yes, Fred, I will.
- All right.
If If my son will give me away.
- No.
No, Mom, no.
Absolutely not.
You said that me and Lisa were rushing too fast.
Y'all gotta take some time to think about this.
The boy's right.
We should think about this.
- Yeah.
- Did you think about it?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Let's get married.
Wait.
Hold up.
Wait a minute.
Y'all need to take some more time.
Boy, I ain't got that much time.
I'm getting old.
Now move.
You're gonna need your bouquet.
Oh, thank you, baby.
Rap on, Rev.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here again today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
Let us pray.
Dear heavenly father I am not kidding.
Irene told Jane that Debbie told Gail that Will Smith did not get married.
I know!
Isn't it great?
Girl, who said it doesn't pay to pray?
Oh, yes, it does.
My prayers came true.
Did he marry her?
I cannot believe he is back on the market.
I mean, you know, I'm sorry for the girl, but who cares?
He is so fine.
Did you see him?
Oh, even in that tux he was looking good.
Wait, wait No.
No.
Wait a Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, now.
This is This is all just too soon.
