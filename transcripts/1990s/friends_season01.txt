{START OF EPISODE 1}
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.
You're going out with the guy.
There has to be something wrong with him.
All right, Joey.
Be nice.
So does he have a hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria..
and I realize I'm totally naked.
I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone..
there.
- Instead of - That's right!
Never had that one.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
What do I do?
Everyone starts looking at me.
They weren't looking at you before?
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
And it turns out it's my mother.
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
Hi.
He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.
You okay?
I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth..
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.
- I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be happy.
- No, you don't.
No, I don't.
To hell with her.
She left me!
You never knew she was a lesbian?
No!
Okay?
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
She didn't know.
How should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.
Oh, really?
So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing..
"I'll never have grandchildren," was what?
A wrong number?
Sorry.
Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
You're angry.
You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joints!
Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.
But I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars!
- Rachel?
- Oh, Monica!
Thank God!
I went to your building..
and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.
Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..
Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?
Sure!
You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
I was in the room with all the presents..
and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low?
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
I always knew he looked familiar, but..
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering..
"Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for"?
I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart..
but you're the only person I know here.
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide"!
"I'll have whatever Christina's having".
Daddy, I just I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me!
"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off".
She should not be wearing those pants.
Push her down the stairs!
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!
Come on, Daddy, listen!
All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe"!
"You're a shoe"!
What if I don't want to be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?
No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Maybe I don't need your money.
Wait!
I said maybe!
Just breathe.
That's it.
Try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now.
I helped.
This is probably for the best.
Independence.
Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.
You can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.
Like there's a rule, or something?
I got it.
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.
It's Paul.
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?
Maybe.
Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.
- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?
That'd be good.
- Really?
- Go on!
It's Paul, the wine guy!
Does he sell it, drink it?
Or he just complains a lot?
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is..
everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name.
Paul?
I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go A-wandering?
Change.
Sit down.
Two seconds.
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.
She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot..
until it starts to get red.
Shut up, Joey!
What are you up to tonight?
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon..
so, nothing.
Right.
You're not even getting your honeymoon.
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?
Talk about your..
big lizards.
If you don't want to be alone tonight..
Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
We're very excited about it.
Thanks.
But I'm just going to hang out here.
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure.
Phoebe, wanna help?
I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you.
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things..
using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..
and I cannot feel my legs.
- We got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.
What's this?
I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.
- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.
Let me ask you.
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
- You guys.
- You got screwed.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
I'm such an idiot.
I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that.
How did you get over it?
He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.
- Say her - Leg?
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
It's about me.
And I just The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..
I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.
But it isn't me.
It's not me.
Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just I'm divorced.
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!
That only took me an hour.
We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.
You have had the love of a woman for four years.
Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.
That is why we don't do it!
I don't think that was my point!
Know what's scary?
What if there's only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about?
One woman.
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.
Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
It's the best thing to happen to you!
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!
- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me..
What?
You wanna spell it out with noodles?
It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
So there's going to be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.
What were you going to say?
Ever since she left me..
I haven't been able to perform..
sexually.
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
How long?
- Two years.
- Wow.
I'm glad you smashed her watch.
So you still think you might want that fifth date?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..
and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..
in the bonds of holy matrimony.
See!
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.
"Grab a spoon".
Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
Great story.
But I gotta go.
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela.
No, Andrea.
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.
Right, thanks.
It's Julie.
I'm out of here.
Here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough..
to ask a woman out..
who am I going to ask?
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.
If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do".
If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something..
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi.
Paul, is it?
- Thank you so much.
- Stop.
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations..
plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.
We'll talk later.
Thank you.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do on a real date?
Shut up and put my table back.
I've got to get to work.
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.
- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything?
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio..
at the little theater in the park?
It was a job!
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy".
- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.
Oh, Chandler!
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.
I see that.
You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know.
He's just so..
- Remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.
- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.
I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.
- Wish me luck!
- What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.
- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?
- How do you do that?
- I hate you.
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.
So, who?
You know Paul?
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
What?
I take credit for Paul.
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line.
Why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed".
I hate men.
Don't hate.
You don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me?
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs..
and men with emotional problems can hear?
Come here.
Give me your feet.
I just thought he was nice, you know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
- Guess what?
- You got a job?
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale..
How well you know me.
They're my "I don't need a job..
I've got great boots" boots.
- How did you pay?
- Credit card.
And who pays for that?
My father.
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.
You can't live off your parents.
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.
Thank you.
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.
Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.
I didn't know anybody here.
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.
And then he killed himself.
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is: "Anyway..
" - You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?
"Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute"?
- I can't do this.
- I know you can.
- No.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.
If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world!
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?
Look what I just found on the floor.
What?
That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy!
All right.
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- I'm sorry.
Have it, I don't want it.
- Split it?
You probably didn't know this, but in high school..
I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think..
?
Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?
Yeah.
Maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you.
Wait, wait.
What's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing - What?
I said - What?
I said - Would you stop?
- Was I doing it again?
Yes!
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.
- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
You made it, or you're serving it?
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream.
I'm in Las Vegas.
Miss, more coffee?
Could you give this to that guy over there?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.
I'm in Las Vegas.
I'm Liza Minnelli..
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
You don't understand.
For us, kissing is as important as any part.
Yeah, right!
You serious?
Oh, yeah.
- Everything is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely.
For us, kissing's an opening act..
like the comedian you have to sit through..
before Pink Floyd comes out.
And it's not that we don't like the comedian.
It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, no matter how great the show was..
you girls are looking for the comedian again.
We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.
Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.
Are we still talking about sex?
The One With the Sonogram at the End No, it's good.
It is good.
It's just that Doesn't she seem a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
Does she?
Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving".
He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
Marsha, see, these are cave people.
Okay, they have issues like: "Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close".
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
- No.
- Yes, it is.
Carol, hi!
Okay.
Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.
- Can I stay?
- No.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's..
the Stone Age.
You look great.
I hate that.
Sorry.
Thanks.
You look good too.
Well, you know, in here, anyone who..
stands erect..
- What's new?
Still a - A lesbian?
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.
She didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding.
Then I've already seen this one.
Are you through with that?
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose ball of paper is this?
Mine.
I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed It's fine.
I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.
Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Relax, you do this every time.
The place looks great.
You got a lasagna here that looks good enough..
to avoid touching.
Monica?
Hi!
Monica, you're scaring me.
I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know?
Not in a good way.
Calm down.
You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come.
That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong.
You see, he's "The Prince".
They had some big ceremony before I was born.
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- It's beautiful.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
No, don't touch that.
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.
"Hi, Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl that stomped on your heart".
Now I must return the ring without the ring..
which makes it so much harder.
Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'll give it back..
- and we'll eat ice cream.
- Okay.
It's a pear-shaped diamond Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.
- When did you have it last?
- Doy, right before she lost it.
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.
I know I had it this morning.
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah?
- Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I gave you one job!
But look how straight those noodles are.
That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
I just can't do it.
Boys?
We're going in.
Hi.
- That is not a happy "hi".
- Carol's pregnant.
I found it!
What?
Yeah.
Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now.
That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.
How do you fit into this whole thing?
Carol and Susan want me to be involved.
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.
- It's totally up to me.
- She is so great.
I miss her.
- What does she mean by "involved"?
- Your job is done.
And the most enjoyable.
Phoebe, say something.
They want me to go down to this sonogram thing..
with them tomorrow.
Remember when life was simpler..
and she was just a lesbian?
Those were the days.
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.
No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.
This is still ruined, right?
Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.
- What's that curry taste?
- Curry.
I think they're great.
I really do.
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.
- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.
Why is this girl going to call me?
She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food..
I told her you have a restaurant - I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
- They don't have to know that.
- Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
- Yes.
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.
We were going to have lasagna.
- I love lasagna.
- We're not having it.
Then why bring it up?
He latches on.
This will sound unbelievably selfish..
but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing?
It might take the heat off of me.
That Rachel.
We saw her parents at the club.
They were not playing well.
I won't say what they spent..
but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.
Don't listen to her.
You've always been independent.
Even when you were a chubby kid..
and you had no friends, you were just fine.
You'd read alone in your room.
Your puzzles..
People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.
With his museum and his published papers.
Others are satisfied with staying where they are.
These people never get cancer.
They're happy with what they have, content..
like cows.
Cows, Dad?
She knows how much I love cows.
I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God..
our "Harmonica" doesn't have that problem.
- I'm telling you, you'll be fine.
- Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, so this does work.
So, Ross, what's going on with you?
Any stories?
No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Look, I realize you guys have been wondering..
what exactly happened between Carol and me.
And so, well, here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She lives with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child.
She and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?
Folks are really that bad?
Well, you know, these people are pros.
They know what they do.
They take their time.
They get the job done.
They say that you can't change your parents.
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.
Must pee.
It's worse when you're twins.
- You're a twin?
- We don't speak.
She's this high-powered, driven, career-type.
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.
- Identical?
- People say we look alike.
But I don't see it.
You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.
Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.
No, although I did have an imaginary friend..
who my parents preferred.
Hit the lights, please.
How long was I in there?
- I'm just cleaning up.
- Oh, you need any help?
Okay, sure.
Thanks.
Anyway..
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
A little.
A lot.
So, got any advice?
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.
You may wanna steer clear of the word "dumped".
Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.
Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn.
You've got Carol tomorrow.
- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.
- Remember being in high school?
- Yeah.
Didn't you think you'd meet someone..
fall in love, and that'd be it?
- Ross?
- Yes.
Yes.
Man, I never thought I'd be here.
Me neither.
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.
There was this big dinosaur thing.
Anyway..
Hi.
- You remember Susan.
- How could I forget?
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.
So, we're just waiting for?
- Dr. Oberman.
- And is he?
- She.
- Of course, "she".
Is she familiar with our special situation?
- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Okay, that's great.
No, I'm Oh.
Thanks.
That opens my cervix.
- Barry?
- Come on in.
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
So, how are you doing?
I'm..
I'm okay.
- You look great.
- Yeah, well.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.
Be right there.
Be back in a second.
I dumped him.
So, how's this all gonna work?
The baby grows in a special place inside Thank you.
I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us?
When important decisions have to be made?
- Give me a "for instance".
- Well, I don't know.
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon.
If it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.
As in "Mouse"?
As in my grandmother.
Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse".
How about..
?
How about Julia?
- Julia.
- We agreed on Minnie.
We agreed we'd spend our lives together.
Things change.
Roll with the punches.
I believe Julia's on the table?
Sorry about that.
So, what have you been up to?
Oh, not much.
- I got a job.
- That's great.
Why are you so tan?
I went to Aruba.
Oh, no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?
No.
I went with..
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?
No.
I went with Mindy.
Mindy?
My maid of honor, Mindy?
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.
You got plugs!
Careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.
And you got lenses.
You hate sticking your finger in your eye.
Not for her.
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay.
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.
And I'm an orthodontist.
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.
We weren't happy.
But with Mindy..
now I'm happy.
- Spit.
- What?
Me.
Anyway..
I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.
Like she'd settle for that.
Yeah, that's true.
But I think it's a nice ring..
and thank you for giving it to me.
Thank you for giving it back.
Hello!
- Please, what's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?
- I don't think so.
- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, it's not Geller.
It'll be Helen Willick?
No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Really?
I don't remember you making any sperm.
And we all know what a challenge that is.
- You two, stop it.
- She gets a credit.
I'm in there too.
Helen Willick Bunch Geller?
I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.
See what he does?
He knows no one's gonna say all those names.
They'll call her Geller.
He gets his way.
My way?
You think this is my way?
Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being..
this is not my You know what?
This is too hard.
Knock, knock.
How are we?
Any nausea?
- A little.
- Just a little.
I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.
- Lie back.
- You know what?
I'm gonna go.
I don't think I can be involved in this family thing.
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.
I know.
Well, isn't that amazing?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
If you tilt your head and relax your eyes..
it kind of looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, all right?
Monica, what do you think?
- Are you welling up?
- No.
- You are.
You're welling up.
- I'm not.
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, it's Rachel.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.
Yeah, he told me.
No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.
And, Min, you know, if everything works out..
and you guys get married and have kids..
I hope they have his hairline and your nose!
That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.
- How did it go?
- Not so good.
He walked me home and said, "Let's do this again".
He said, "Let's do this again".
That's good, right?
Translated, "Let's do this again" means, "You'll never see me naked".
Since when?
Since always.
It's, like, dating language.
Like, "It's not you" means, "It is you".
"You're nice" means, "I'll be dating alcoholics..
and complaining about them to you".
"We should see other people" means: "Ha-ha, I already am"!
Everybody knows this?
Cushions the blow.
Like your parents putting the dog to sleep..
and saying it went to a farm.
That's funny.
Because our parents actually did..
send our dog off to live on a farm.
Ross?
Hello!
The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
The Milners had this unbelievable farm.
They had horses and rabbits to chase.
And it was..
Oh, my God!
Chi-Chi!
The One With the Thumb How does it feel knowing you're about to die?
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
That was really good!
Thanks.
Let's keep going.
So, what do you want from me, Dimon?
Huh?
I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.
Smoke away!
I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
- What?
- Relax your hand.
Let your wrist go.
Not so much!
All right.
Now take a puff.
Right.
- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine.
Do you want to get this part or not?
Here.
When you hold it, you feel right.
You feel complete.
- You miss it?
- No, not so much.
All right.
Now we smoke.
Oh, my God!
- Give me that!
- No.
You've got options.
You can smoke like this: - Chandler - Or hold it in your mouth.
Give me the cigarette!
- You try.
- Thank you.
Okay, how's this?
Okay, that's not bad.
All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.
All right, you keep practicing..
and I'll go put out the sofa.
I thought it was foot size.
No.
It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb..
to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous.
Can I use either thumb?
I'd rather go with the foot theory.
All right.
Don't tell me.
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
Coffee, black.
Latte.
And an iced tea.
- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!
Good for me!
- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth It's my bank.
- What did they do?
- It's nothing I get my mail and open their monthly "statement".
Easy!
And there's $500 extra in my account.
Satan's minions at work again!
Now I have to go deal with them - What are you talking about?
Keep it!
- It's not mine.
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.
But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
Know what I'd hear with every step?
"Not mine.
Not mine.
Not mine".
Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear: "Not-not mine.
Not-not mine".
We're with you.
We got it.
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, gross!
- What is this?
- I'm smoking!
You've been so good for three years!
And this is my reward.
Think about what you went through when you quit.
Forget about you.
Think about what we went through!
So this time I won't quit.
- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!
Oh, no!
I can't drink this now.
I'm gonna go.
I've got a date.
With Alan again?
How's it going?
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.
When do we get to meet him?
Let's see, it's Monday..
- Never.
- Come on!
Not after what happened with Steve.
What do you mean?
We love Steve.
Steve was sexy!
Sorry.
I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.
Then can we meet him?
No.
Sorry.
Joey.
Let it go.
Why should they meet him?
I bring a guy home and they're like..
coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef..
I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.
Your friends are just looking after you.
I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked.
You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer..
- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.
- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.
Okay, I'm done.
Let it go, Ross.
You didn't know Chi-Chi.
- Do you all promise?
- We promise.
We'll be good.
Chandler, do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside!
"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..
and hope you'll accept this football phone..
as our gift".
Do you believe it?
Now I have $ 1000 and a football phone.
What bank is this?
Okay, it's him.
- Who is it?
- Alan.
Chandler!
He's here!
Do I look okay?
One more button.
Closed!
How about closed?
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.
Please be good.
Remember how much you all like me?
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.
I've heard so much about all you guys.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
Who's gonna take the first shot?
Come on!
I'll go.
Let's start with how he kept picking I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.
We loved him!
Wait!
We're talking about someone I'm going out with?
That pimento trick!
I'll never look at an olive the same way again.
And did you notice?
Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.
- Yes!
Like the man in the shoe!
- What shoe?
From the rhyme.
There was a man With a crooked smile Who lived in a shoe For a while So I think Alan..
is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.
Future boyfriends?
- I think this could be "it".
- Really?
I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.
You know I'll be doing that at parties.
- Know what I like most?
- What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
How was the game?
Well..
We won!
Fantastic!
Question.
How is that possible?
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable!
Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.
It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..
It was like he made us into a team.
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.
Can I ask a question?
Do you think Alan is sometimes..
What?
I don't know.
A little too "Alan"?
Oh, no.
Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan".
It's his innate "Alan-ness" that we adore.
I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, weird girl.
- I brought alphabet soup.
- Pick out the vowels?
I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y." - And something else.
- Saltines?
No, $1000 and a football phone.
What?
Oh, my God!
- There's really money in here.
- I know.
What are you doing?
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.
- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't - Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.
- It's okay.
Thanks.
- Let me do something.
I'll tell you what.
Buy me a soda and we're even.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Lizzy.
Want a pretzel?
- No, I'm fine.
Thanks.
- See you.
A thumb?
I know.
There it was, just floating..
like this tiny little hitchhiker.
Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five".
- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!
Don't do that.
Come on!
It's worse than the thumb.
- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.
Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?
I could live without it.
Is it a little annoying?
Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Indeed there isn't.
I should get back to work.
Otherwise someone might get what they ordered.
The hair comes out and the gloves come off.
Ever go out with a guy your friends really like?
No.
I'm going out with a guy my friends really like.
Are we talking about the coyotes here?
All right!
A cow got through.
Can you believe it?
It's just, you know what?
I just don't feel the "thing".
They feel the thing.
I don't feel it.
Honey, you should always feel the thing.
If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.
- It's gonna be really hard.
- He'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.
- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?
I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Alan wants to speak to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy!
What's up?
She told you about that, huh?
Well, yeah.
I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.
It's not that Well, that's true.
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.
Well, okay.
Thanks.
God, he's good.
- If only he were a woman.
- Yeah.
Lamb Chop!
How old is that sock?
If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..
so I killed him.
Do you think that was wrong?
- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.
There you go.
I'm alive with pleasure now.
Phoebe, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Hey, I might.
I'm sorry.
The soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb.
And on my way over here I stepped in gum.
What is up with the universe?
- What's going on?
- It's just nice when we're together.
It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait!
I'm getting a deja vu.
No, I'm not.
- We have to talk.
- There it is!
Okay, it's about Alan.
Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.
Before you get into that, there's something you should know.
There's really no easy way to say this.
I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
No, it's just..
you know, things change.
People change.
We didn't change.
So that's it?
It's over?
Just like that?
You let your guard down.
You start to care about someone, and..
- I can go on pretending - Okay!
No.
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.
Well, who wants fair?
I just want things back, you know, the way they were.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.
I can't believe this!
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.
I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.
Yeah, right!
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.
We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
- Wow.
- I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.
- But I'm a little relieved.
- Relieved?
Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.
I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?
That was fun.
He could row like a Viking.
So how'd it go?
You know.
Did he mention us?
He says he's really gonna miss you guys.
- Rough day, huh?
- You have no idea.
Come here.
- That's it.
I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!
I don't care!
I'm weak!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000.
Yeah, all right.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
All right, Phoebe?
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace no hunger, good things for the rain forest.
And bigger boobs.
Well, see, you took mine.
What about you?
If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
There's always one guy.
"lf I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.
" Hey, Joey.
What would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself.
Excuse me?
If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.
Joey, omnipotent.
You are?
Ross, l' m sorry.
I had no idea.
I thought it was a theoretical question.
The One With the George Stephanopoulos How does she do that?
I can't sleep in a public place.
Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters.
You slept at the Grand Canyon.
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us to the Grand Canyon.
Mom and Dad took us to the Grand Canyon?
Would you look at her?
She is so peaceful.
Yeah.
What?
What?
What?
-Hi.
-It's okay.
You just nodded off again.
What's going on?
I got no sleep last night.
My grandmother has a new boyfriend and they' re both kind of insecure in bed, so And deaf.
They reassure each other that they' re having a good time.
You have no idea how loud they are.
-You can stay with Rachel and me.
-Thanks.
Less than 1 00 steps from our place to here.
You got way too much free time, man.
There's the birthday boy.
Hockey tickets.
Rangers-Penguins tonight and we're taking you.
-Happy birthday, pal!
-We love you, man.
It's funny.
My birthday was seven months ago.
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?
Oh, my God!
Is today the 20th?
October 20th?
-I hoped you wouldn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?
Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?
T oday's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.
Sex.
-You told your sister that?
-Believe me, I told everyone.
I better pass on the game.
I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!
Come on, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it will take my mind off it.
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.
Look, look, look!
My first paycheck!
Look at the window!
There's my name!
Hi, me!
I remember when I got my first paycheck.
There was a cave-in in a mine, and eight people were killed.
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen.
Why?
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk.
And it was totally not worth it.
What's FlCA?
Why's he getting all my money?
I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.
This is not that bad.
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.
-Hockey!
-Hockey!
-Hockey!
-Hockey.
Rachel?
Oh, my God!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
What are you doing here?
We were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, and it's true!
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.
God, look at you!
You're so big!
I can't believe it!
I know, I know!
I'm a duplex.
IKiki, you look phenomenal.
I mean, you've lost, like, a ton of weight.
And you should really, really It's time to stop, you look perfect.
What's going on?
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
And while we're on the subject of news.
Look, look!
I have elbows!
Passes it up to Leetch.
Leetch spots Messier.
Here's the pass!
We'll take a time-out while Messier looks at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we first.
You know?
In fact, she.
She never took them off.
It's because we Sorry, sorry.
I can't believe -What?
-Peach pit.
Yes, bunny?
Peach pit.
That night, we had -Peaches?
-Actually, nectarines but.
Could've been a peach.
Then we Then we got dressed and I walked her to the bus stop.
I' m fine.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's.
What?
I thought we were trying to find stuff.
Come on, you guys.
T ell me all the dirt.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar.
-Let's talk reality for a second.
-Okay.
-When are you coming home?
-What?
Guys, l' m not.
-Come on.
This is us.
-l' m not.
This is what l' m doing now.
I've got this job.
I even do my own laundry.
-This is what l' m doing now.
-Waitressing?
I' m not just waitressing.
I mean, l' m. I write the specials on the specials board.
And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?
Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death punch?
-What's that?
-Well, it's rum and Okay.
Since Phoebe's staying, we'll have a slumber party.
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.
And I brought Operation.
But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.
But we can prep the guy.
-Rach, it's the Visa card people.
-Oh, God.
Ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
There's been unusual activity on your account.
I haven't used my card in weeks.
That is the unusual activity.
They wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay?
Okay, let's see.
Well, let's see.
The FlCA guys took all my money.
Everyone is getting married or pregnant or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!
If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay.
Okay?
Rachel has left the building.
Can you call back?
All right!
Come on!
Let's play Twister!
-Sorry.
-Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
There was ice that night with Carol?
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
No, I was just saying we're not sitting together.
But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.
It was the first frost.
Sit.
Just sit down.
Sit.
You're doing this amazing independent thing.
Monica, what is so amazing?
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?
-You are just like Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Right.
He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.
And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities.
He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.
Okay.
But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.
-Okay, I know I didn't love him.
-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.
Everything was figured out.
Now it's like.
-Floopy?
-Yeah.
We don't know where we' re going.
It's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be un-floopy.
Yeah, like that's a word.
Okay.
But Monica, what if it doesn't come together?
Pheebs?
Well, because you just I don't like this question.
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?
I mean, what if all we've got are beans?
Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
Yes!
You're not laughing now, are you, pal?
All you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it!
Pass it!
-He's open!
He's open!
-Shoot it!
Shoot it!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.
Excuse me?
It says to call if you're not satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Well, the label promises nutty goodness.
It's an emergency.
But you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on.
Fill these out.
Sit over there!
I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.
-My face is dented.
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
-How long do you think it will be?
-Any minute now.
Hey, this I' m so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
-Pizza guy.
-Food!
-Phoebe?
-What?
-Do you have a plan?
-I don't even have a " pla.
" One mushroom, green pepper and onion?
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!
We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese!
Wait.
You' re not G. Stephanopoulos?
Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Wait!
Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours.
Bonehead!
Bonehead!
When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.
Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a towel.
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?
What, are you nuts?
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?
That's Big Bird's friend.
-I see pizza!
-I want to see.
Let me see.
Hello!
Who are we spying on?
White House adviser, Clinton's campaign guy.
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, cute butt.
Oh, him!
The little guy.
Oh, I love him!
-Wait.
Wait, I see a woman.
-T ell me it's his mother.
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!
Wait, she's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking.
She's going for the pizza That's not for you, bitch!
We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.
That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?
Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.
I know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.
-Come on, push me.
-No.
-Push me.
-We' re gonna get in trouble.
Don't be a baby.
Push me.
Push me.
All right.
I' m gonna push you, okay?
How about I push you like this?
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, pally-wally.
I am so very sorry.
Can I sign you?
-Lights still out?
-Yeah.
Well, maybe they' re napping.
-Please.
They' re having sex.
-Shut up!
So, what do you think George is like?
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you have to draw him out.
And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feel funny talking about that.
-Oh, come on.
-Okay.
Well.
I think Joey's like a little kiddie ride.
You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.
He might surprise you.
One time, he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.
Come on, baby, come on.
Let's go.
Yes!
Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.
I think it's an act.
Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.
-Ross.
-No, guys.
Please, he is my brother.
I know exactly what you mean.
He can be really smooth.
Can't you just picture him in bed?
I really don't want to.
Come on, laugh.
Laugh.
I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.
The moon, the glow, the magical feeling.
You did this.
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right.
Enough.
What's the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for the first time.
You slept with her for seven years after that.
It's a little more complicated What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women?
Louder.
There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.
Then, what?
My first time with Carol was was my.
What?
It was my first time.
With Carol?
Oh.
So, in your whole life, you've only been with one?
Oh, boy.
Hockey was a big mistake.
There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.
Okay, I got one.
Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
-What?
You slept with Jason?
-You had already broken up.
-How long?
-Just a couple hours.
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!
Anyway, the valentine T om left in your locker was really from me!
Excuse me?
Hello!
Like he was really gonna send you one.
She was a big girl!
Really?
Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing.
You made me laugh!
Oh, my God!
There he is!
There he is!
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.
-Come on, drop the towel.
-Drop it.
Will you please drop it?
Wow!
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.
It's romantic.
Really?
You kidding?
The guy's a freak.
I judge him.
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!
Oh, that's attractive.
I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.
Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun?
Where was the fun?
T ell me which part was fun.
Where's my puck?
-The kid has it.
-The kid Excuse me, that's my puck.
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
I' m rubber, you' re glue.
Whatever you I can't do it.
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.
-Yes, how about?
-No.
-Give me my puck.
-No.
No roughhousing in my ER!
Give me my puck!
Now that was fun.
Okay, Monica.
Right foot, red.
We could've played Monopoly, but no!
Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs.
Right hand, blue.
Ross, switch with me and Phoebe could be number two.
Nothing.
It's a Twister thing.
The rules are on the back of the box.
Hello?
It's the Visa card people.
-Okay.
Will you take my place?
-All right.
This is Rachel.
No!
Hello?
Oh, yeah.
No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.
Oh, well, thanks.
But l' m okay, really.
-To the green.
-Oh, no.
I've got magic beans.
No, no, never mind.
T o the left!
T o the left!
I' m fine.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Let it go.
It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.
You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!
A bra.
Right out the sleeve.
As far as I know, guys don't do anything that comes close.
Right?
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.
We can?
Okay, I'm trying that.
Know what blows my mind?
Women can see breasts anytime they want.
You look down, and there they are.
How you get any work done is beyond me.
I don't get how guys can do so many mean things and not even care.
-Multiple orgasms!
-There you go.
The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Saturday night.
The big night!
Date night!
Saturday night.
Saturday night!
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!
Not even breaking up with Janice?
Right, right.
Shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.
Except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell.
-You just gotta do it.
-I know.
But it's just so hard.
You're sitting there with her.
She has no idea.
You finally get up the courage to do it.
There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note.
Why do you have to break up with her?
Be a man.
Just stop calling.
If you want, I'll do it with you.
She'd feel like we're ganging up on her.
You dump Janice, I'll dump T ony.
-You're breaking up with T ony?
-He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.
I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know.
Do you want anything else?
You had a nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y, pie thing that Nothing.
I' m fine.
What's wrong?
Why so scrunchie?
My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady.
" I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he say "You' re not up to this" again?
I got the extended version with choruses of "You'll Never Make it on Your Own.
" Hi, Joey.
Oh, my God!
Angela!
Wow!
Being dumped by you agrees with her.
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.
Yeah.
No.
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.
One Mississippi, two Mississippi three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.
-Hey, Angela.
-Joey.
You look good.
That's because l' m wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
You don't say.
So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
Guess who's doing laundry there too?
-Who?
-Me!
Was that not clear?
Why don't?
Why don't I just join you both there?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Yes.
I do have a laundry room in my building.
But there's a rat problem.
Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets.
They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy.
-Anyway, 7-ish?
-Sure.
-Forget it.
I' m with Bob now.
-Bob?
Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great.
He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job.
You go on three auditions a month and you' re an actor.
Bob Come on!
We were great together.
And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.
Sorry, Joey.
You said, " Let's be friends.
" So guess what?
-What?
-We' re just friends.
Fine.
Fine.
Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight?
As friends.
What "four of us"?
You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend Monica.
I' m telling you, this guy's perfect for you.
Forget it!
Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob.
He's Angela's brother.
He's smart, he's sophisticated and he has a real job.
I go on three auditions a month and say l' m an actor, but he's -God help us.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
Look, l' m asking a favor here.
If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on?
You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but Angela's different.
She's like one of a kind, like a snowflake or.
-Something else like a snowflake?
-Yeah, yeah.
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.
Will you help me?
Please?
Hold on a sec.
You need to not touch any of those.
Okay, bye.
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Hold on, camper.
You've thought this through?
It's laundry.
The thinking-through is minimal.
Just you and Rachel?
Just you two?
This is a date.
You're going on a date.
-Uh-uh.
-Uh-huh.
-I haven't done that in a while.
-ls it a date if she doesn't know?
Yes, absolutely.
Saturday night, all rules apply.
What are you saying?
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
It's the first time she'll see your underwear.
You want it dirty?
No.
And the fabric softener?
Okay, now what is wrong with my Snuggles?
What?
It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
-I'll pick something else up.
-There you go.
Thank you.
What does Bob look like?
Is he tall, short?
Yep.
-Which?
-Which what?
-You've never met Bob, have you?
-No, but -For all we know, he's horribly -Hey, Joey!
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they?
Where are they?
This is nice.
We never do anything, just the two of us.
Great.
Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies.
I don't wanna do that.
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.
I had the most supremely awful day.
That's not good.
Can I get an espresso and a latte over here?
We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables.
They sucked.
I blew off the afternoon.
I went shopping.
And I got you.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
I' m looking.
-I got you -What?
-What?
-What did you get me there?
I got you these.
Bullwinkle socks.
-That's sweet.
-I knew you had Rockys.
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix.
Moose and squirrel.
Whatever you want.
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?
No, l' m still working on mine.
-That's it?
-Yeah, it was really hard.
-Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.
-You weren't there.
-Sorry.
-How are things going?
Going?
Things are not going.
She got me socks.
These go with your Rockys.
She really cares about you l' m sorry.
Coming through.
Move.
Move!
Excuse me!
I was kind of using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?
It's pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!
What?
No suds, no save, okay?
What's going on?
Nothing.
This horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?
-You know, no suds, no save.
-No suds, no Excuse me.
Hold on a second!
This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!
Hey, hey, hey!
That's not the rule, and you know it!
All right.
Show's over.
Nothing to see here.
Okay.
Let's do laundry.
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you' re such a sweet, gentle.
Do you?
Do you?
Oh, hey.
You must need detergent.
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.
It's new.
It's German.
It's extra tough!
Rach, are you gonna separate those?
Oh, God.
Am I being a total laundry spaz?
Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?
Have you never done this before?
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.
Okay.
You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.
Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.
A whole other machine for your colors.
And a third for your delicates.
That would be your bras and your underpanty things.
These are white cotton panties.
Would they go with whites or with delicates?
That would be a judgment call.
He's so cute!
Where did you grow up?
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.
-How'd that happen?
-My God!
What?
I suddenly had the feeling I was falling.
But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
-Yep.
Pretty much.
-You' re a lucky man.
Know what I miss most about her?
That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats.
Like a happy little squirrel or a weasel.
-I never really noticed.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
Listen for it.
Monica.
Monica is great.
Yeah, she is.
But it's not gonna last.
She's too much for me in bed.
Sexually.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
It's great to meet a smart, funny guy who's emotionally older than 8.
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!
My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
That's nice.
You can.
It's like pulling off a Band-Aid.
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Go!
Go!
Hi, Janice.
Here we go.
I don't think we should go out anymore.
All right.
Well, there you go.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
This isn't about you.
I know!
It's about your fear of commitment.
I' m not afraid.
-Please.
-I don't!
-I don't!
I' m ready to commit anytime.
-Really?
I know this is gonna sound stupid but I feel that if I can do this if I can actually do my own laundry there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me.
The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Next on Ross.
-Uh-oh.
-What?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.
It's a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh!
The laundry's done -What's the matter?
-Nothing.
The laundry's done Come on, show me.
It's just that you left a red sock with your whites, and now everything's kind of pink.
Everything's pink?
Except for the red sock, which is still red.
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.
But it happened to me.
God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep!
What am I doing?
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.
I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head.
So anyway his head is flopping down Broadway, right?
And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is.
Something's in my eye.
Could we check it in the light, please?
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Were we at the same table?
It's like cocktails in Appalachia.
-They' re close.
-Close?
Her tongue's in his ear.
Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting.
It's not really true' is it?
Who's to say what's true?
-What were you thinking?
-l' m not proud of this, okay?
Well, maybe I am a little.
-l' m out of here!
-Wait!
You like him.
I want her.
He likes you.
-Really?
-Yeah.
If we put our heads together, between the two of us we can break them up.
I' m sorry.
I can't believe I did this.
I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Waiter?
One more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing.
We're different.
I'm bing, bing, bing.
You' re boom, boom, boom.
Oh, my God!
I' m so sorry!
Are you okay?
It's just my lens.
It's my lens.
I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye!
In the eye!
This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!
Oh, my God!
-How many have you had?
-I don't know.
A million!
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.
-l' m fine, l' m fine.
-All right.
-l' m not fine.
Here she is.
-Wait here, okay?
Breathe.
-How do you do that?
-It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
I'd like that!
The clothes are clean.
That's the important part.
I guess.
Except everything looks like jammies now.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
We had this cart.
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.
I' m sorry.
Maybe I wasn't being clear.
This was our cart.
There weren't clothes in it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!
Let go!
Come on, it's my cart.
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it you' re gonna have to take me with it!
-Yes!
Did you see that?
-You were incredible.
A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
I could not have done this without you.
More clothes in the dryer?
-I'm fine.
I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
-Are you sure you' re okay?
-Yeah.
-Does it still hurt?
-Yeah.
What a neat idea!
All your clothes match.
I' m gonna do this.
-How'd it go?
-Excellent!
We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story.
-I'm fine, by the way.
-I'm sorry.
-Where's Chandler?
-He needed time to grieve.
I' m free!
I' m free!
That ought to do it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Oh, look look look!
There's Joey's picture!
This is so exciting!
You can always spot someone who's never seen his one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.
"The role of man number three will not be played by Vic Shapiro.
" We came on the wrong night.
I can't believe I forgot to bring a magazine.
-Come on you guys, this might be good.
-I don't know.
The exclamation point scares me.
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Magic is about to happen!
Well, Eva we've done some excellent work here.
And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.
All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle To play with or simply let hang The One With the Butt I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off to have something else to do?
Ross, 10:00.
Is it?
It feels like 2.
-No, 10:00!
-What?
There's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 10:00!
Hello!
She's amazing!
She makes the women l dream about look like fat, bald men.
Go over.
She's not with anyone.
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me.
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.
Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.
He couldn't get a woman like that in a million years.
You always see these beautiful women with "nothing" guys.
You could be one of those guys.
-You could do that.
-You think?
Absolutely!
I can't believe I'm considering this.
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.
Here goes.
Stand back, everyone.
Incoming ego shrapnel.
All right, I can do this.
-Yes?
-Hi.
Okay, next word would be Chandler.
Chandler is my name and.
Hi!
Yes, you said that.
Yes!
Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say.
What I wanted to say was would you like to go out with me?
Thank you.
Good night.
Chandler?
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!
What'd you think?
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!
It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.
-You're right.
-We saw your head.
How about that accent?
Yeah.
All of your W's were V's.
She said yes!
Awful play, man!
Her name's Aurora.
She's ltalian and she pronounces my name " Chandler.
" I like that better.
The usher gave me this.
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard T alent Agency.
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!
Based on this play?
Based on this play!
Look!
There's a note on the back.
"Loved your work.
Call me a sap.
" She was obviously very moved!
You should call her fairly quickly.
Yeah!
As soon as possible!
Come in!
Hi.
I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.
Just a moment, let me see if she's in.
Hello.
-You' re Estelle?
-I know you weren't expecting someone so fantastically beautiful.
Love lump.
T ake a load off already, darling.
Sit already.
I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.
Why not?
-What I meant was -You don't mind if I eat, do you?
Joey sweetheart, let me ask you a question.
Did you ever see the movie Sleepless in Seattle?
-Wow!
Do you represent those actors?
-No.
But you know the end, where they' re happy?
That's gonna be you and me.
You mean you wanna sign me?
No, I wanna go to the top of the Empire State Building and make out.
Of course I wanna sign you!
-Miss Leonard, I'm so -Oh, boy.
-Ride them, cowboy.
-l' m sorry!
I don't see it!
-T ry to look through it.
-Unfocus your eyes.
Focus?
There's nothing to focus on.
-It's the Statue of Liberty!
-Right!
-Where's the Statue of Liberty?
-There.
I can't not see it now.
Hey, kids!
Come here.
Do you see anything here?
-lt looks like a boat.
-A boat.
Right in front of the Statue of Liberty.
It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.
How was your date, Chandler?
It was unbelievable!
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!
She was in the Israeli army.
None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border.
But just barely, and l. I've been talking about myself all night long.
I'm sorry.
What about you?
T ell me a story.
All right, once I got on the subway.
And it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn.
Just for the hell of it.
We talked until 2:00.
It was perfect.
More or less.
Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
I' m sorry, so "we" is?
"We" is me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
My husband.
-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.
I' m sorry.
So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?
No, l' m still married.
So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry.
He'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan?
There's an Ethan?
Ethan is my boyfriend.
What?
What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you have a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose, mainly sexual.
Sorry it didn't work out.
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen?
It's twisted!
How could you get involved with her?
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.
All the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility.
-This is every guy's fantasy!
-That's not true!
-Ross, is this your fantasy?
-No, of course not.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
You'd go out with someone going out with someone else?
-I couldn't.
-Good for you.
When l' m with a woman, I need to know I' m going out with more people than her.
Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced.
It was hard.
His kids liked me better than him.
What does this have to do with Chandler?
Nothing.
I didn't have anything on that topic.
So I went another way.
You know, monogamy can be a tricky concept.
I mean, anthropologically speaking Fine.
Now you'll never know.
We' re kidding.
T ell us.
-We wanna know.
-Come on!
All right.
There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey Are we greeting each other this way now?
I like it.
Look!
I cleaned!
I did the windows.
I did the floors.
I used all the vacuum attachments but the round one.
What's it for?
Nobody knows.
And we're not supposed to ask.
What do you think?
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!
I see you moved the green ottoman.
How did that happen?
I don't know.
It looked better there.
And it's an extra seat around the table.
Yeah, it's interesting.
But you know what?
Just for fun Iet's see what it looked like in the old spot.
Just to compare.
Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too.
Let's leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.
She'll scratch your eyes out.
-You guys, I am not that bad!
-Yeah, you are.
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little.
That is so unfair!
When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.
But hey, I can be a kook!
All right, you madcap gal!
Imagine this.
The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
-Why not?
-Because you're a kook!
You wait until they send a notice.
I could do that.
Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping -No problem.
-I'm not done yet.
And I buy detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?
One might wonder.
But I would be fine with that.
A glass is on the table with no coaster.
A cold drink.
A hot day.
Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood.
Stop it!
Oh, my God!
It's true.
Who am l?
Monica, you' re Mom.
Oh, my God!
Okay, I'll be there.
That was my agent.
My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie!
-That's great!
-What's the part?
Can you believe it?
Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor!
" Out of order?
You' re out of order!
This whole courtroom's out of order!
" Seriously, what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
" Come on.
Seriously, Joey, what's the part?
You' re.
What?
I' m his butt double, okay?
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right?
He goes into the shower, and then I' m his butt.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys.
It's a real Pacino movie and that's big!
It's terrific.
You deserve this.
After years of struggling you've cracked your way into show business.
Fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.
-This is a big break for me!
-You' re right.
It is.
So, will you invite us to the big opening?
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?
T oday's the big day!
You got any tweezers?
I think I have a rogue hair.
God.
Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.
Don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you.
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.
My eyes!
My eyes!
I warned you.
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
You got the whole night?
Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so.
Do I sense resentment?
No.
No resentment.
Believe me it's worth it, okay?
In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life.
Every single second is like that with Aurora.
I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.
So, Monica, can you help me with the door?
The old Monica would remind you to scrub that T eflon pan with a plastic brush.
But l' m not gonna do that.
Excuse me?
Can they warm it up?
I' m concerned about goose bumps.
Everybody ready?
I wanna thank you for this opportunity.
I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday Lose the robe.
Right.
Okay.
Losing the robe!
Okay, and the robe is lost.
I would like to get this in one take.
Let's roll it.
Water's working.
And action!
And cut!
Butt guy, what are you doing?
I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
The way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?
His wife's dead, his brother's missing.
I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.
Once again, rolling.
Water working.
And action!
And cut!
What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation.
But if you have to ask.
God, I love these fingers.
Thank you.
No, actually, I meant my fingers.
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!
-Don't go.
-Okay.
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.
I' m sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.
-I thought you talked to Rick.
-It's not Rick.
Ethan?
He gets the whole day!
No, it's Andrew.
I know there'll be moments when I'll regret asking the following question, but.
-And Andrew is?
-He's new.
So you' re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was Most women would kill for three guys like us.
-So, what do you want?
-You.
-You have me.
-No.
Just you.
-What do you mean?
-Lose the other guys.
Like, all of them?
Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?
Can't we have what we have now?
Why can't we talk and make love without feeling obligated to each other?
Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
Well, part of me wants that but it's like l' m two guys.
One guy's saying, "This is great!
" But there's this other guy.
The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows and breaks that measuring device.
He's saying, you know, "This is too hard.
Get out!
" So, which one of the guys will you listen to?
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.
Which one?
The second guy.
I see.
Call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!
Right?
I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.
T ell me why you did this again?
Movie star!
Wait!
Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Pacino movie?
Nope.
No?
What happened, big guy?
Big guy?
It felt like a "big guy" moment.
I got fired!
They said I acted too much with it.
I told everybody about this!
-Everybody's expecting to see me.
-lKnow what?
-No one will be able to tell.
-My mom will.
There's something so sweet and disturbing about that.
I've done crappy plays for six years and I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't it.
I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.
Did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell.
I was naked.
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.
I believe things are gonna happen for you.
I do.
You've got to think about the day some kid will go: "l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass!
" You think?
That's so nice.
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.
-Good night.
-Good night.
You' re gonna leave your shoes out here?
Really?
Just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner?
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow.
Or not!
Whenever.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.
No, don 't do this!
This is stupid!
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.
But then everyone will know.
Unless I get them, then wake up really early and put them back.
I need help!
-All you want is a dinkle -Not that song!
-All you envy's a schwang -Come on, you guys.
A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Everybody!
Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks.
I wanna start with a song that's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is really all about.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Oh, great.
This is just The One With The Blackout This is so cool, you guys.
The entire city's blacked out.
It's all of Manhattan.
They have no idea when it's back on.
-You guys, this is big.
-Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?
Who will I meet in a blackout?
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?
-Can we talk about this later?
Okay.
-Can I borrow the phone?
I wanna call my apartment and check on my grandma.
What's my number?
I never call me.
Oh, my God!
It's her.
It's that Victoria 's Secret model.
Something Goodacre.
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.
She 's right.
It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.
Oh, my God!
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium.
Yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot.
I' m fine.
I' m just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule, I'm going with vestibule.
I' m fine.
No, l' m not alone.
I don't know, some guy.
Oh, some guy.
I am some guy.
Jill, I saw you with some guy last night.
Yes, he was some guy.
Hey, everyone.
Officiating at tonight's blackout is Rabbi T ribbiani.
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish.
These are our only candles.
So happy Hanukkah!
Look!
Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes and you still haven 't said one word.
God!
Do something!
Just make contact.
Smile!
There you go.
You 're definitely scaring her.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mom.
Mom.
Mom, you' re tripping!
Dexter's a dog.
The blackout's scaring him.
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too if you didn't know.
All right, call me back.
-Mothers.
-Yeah.
Attaboy!
A word.
That wasn 't so hard.
Mothers.
Yeah!
Mothers.
Yeah!
Perfect.
Don 't smile.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
Yeah, thanks.
-Hello?
-It's me.
-It's Chandler.
Are you okay?
-Yeah, l' m fine.
I' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.
-What?
-l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.
I have no idea what you said.
Put Joey on the phone.
-What's up, man?
-l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Oh, my God!
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Chandler, listen.
Like that thought never entered my mind.
-Okay.
-Somebody.
-I'll go.
I'll go.
-Okay.
Senior year of college, on a pool table.
-Pool table?
-That's my sister.
Okay, my weirdest place would have to be the women's room of the New York City Public Library.
Oh, my God!
What were you doing in a library?
-Pheebs, what about you?
-Oh, Milwaukee.
It's a really weird place.
Ross?
Disneyland, 1 989.
" It's a small world after all.
" No way.
The ride broke down so Carol and I went behind those mechanical Dutch children.
We were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Let's see, that leaves.
-Rachel?
-Come on, I already went.
-You did not go.
-I did.
T ell us.
Come on.
All right, the weirdest place would have to be the foot of the bed.
-Step back!
-We have a winner!
This must be what the fridge looks like with the door closed.
Spooky.
Anybody hungry?
We got a Klondikesoup.
I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.
Where you have to have somebody even in a theme park.
It was the only thing to do that didn't have a line.
Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
-Come on.
-No.
He said we held up the people behind us.
You didn't marry him because?
Do you think there are people that go through life never having that kind of?
-Probably.
-Really?
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.
-Yeah, right.
-lt is.
Eventually, it kind of burns out.
But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and.
In my ex-wife's case, lesbianism.
For those people who miss out on that passion thing there's other stuff.
-Okay.
-But I don't think that'll be you.
-You don't?
-See, I see - big passion in your future.
-Really?
-You do?
-I do.
Ross, you' re so great.
It's never gonna happen.
-What?
-You and Rachel.
What?
Me and Ra?
Why not?
You waited too long to make your move and now you' re in the "friend zone.
" -l' m not in the zone.
-No, Ross.
You' re mayor of the zone.
Look, l' m taking my time, all right?
I' m laying the groundwork.
Every day I get a little bit closer to Priesthood!
I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.
She just ran her fingers through my hair.
-Were you missing that interaction?
-No, no, no.
This is running fingers through your hair, okay?
Now this is a tousle.
If you don't ask her out soon, you'll be in the zone forever.
I will, I will.
I'm waiting for the right moment.
What?
-What, now?
-Yeah.
What's messing you up?
The wine?
The moonlight?
You gotta go up to her and say, " Look, Rachel, l" -What?
-We' re shushing because we' re trying to hear something.
-What?
What?
-Don't you hear that?
See?
-Would you like gum?
-ls it sugarless?
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then no, thanks.
What was that?
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.
If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it!
New York City has no power And the milk is getting sour But to me it is not scary Because I stay away from dairy -Here goes.
-You'll do it?
-I'll do it.
-Want help?
You come out, you' re a dead man.
-Good luck, man.
-Thanks.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Where you going?
You can't go out there.
-Why not?
-Because of the reason.
-That would be?
-I can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
You gotta promise you'll never tell Ross that I told you.
-What?
-He's planning your birthday party.
-Oh, my God!
I love him!
-You better act surprised.
-About what?
-My surprise party.
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it.
Joey already told me.
He didn't tell me.
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.
This is typical.
I'm always the last to know.
You are not.
We tell you stuff.
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock.
I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey.
What?
Looks like I was second to last.
You had a crush on me?
All right.
It wasn't a crush, it was a dent.
Big dent?
You were moving your furniture.
I thought you had nice arms.
Nice arms, huh?
Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair.
Do anything for you?
With all the lights out you can actually see the stars.
It's so nice.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not so much a question.
It's more of a general wondering.
ment.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Here it goes.
Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.
-Yes, that's right.
-Look at that little kitty!
What?
Top of the world Looking down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I found Ever since you 've been around All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.
-Ow!
-Sorry, that was wax.
Poor little T ooty's scared.
We should find his owner.
Why not put poor T ooty in the hall?
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.
Yeah?
Damage control.
Get back to the gum.
Gum would be perfection.
Gum would be perfection?
Gum would be perfection.
Could've said, "Gum would be nice.
" But, no.
For me, gum is perfection.
I loathe myself!
Oh, no, they' re nuns.
They hate all living things.
Hi.
We just found this cat, and we' re looking for the owner.
Yeah, it's mine.
-He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?
-It's my cat.
Give me my cat.
-Wait a minute.
What's his name?
-Bob Buttons.
-Bob Buttons?
-Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.
You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Where did you go, little kitty?
IKitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty.
-Hi.
-Buona sera.
Wow!
Mon, wanna go for a ride in my racecar?
I'll bring my arms.
We can bring my wheelbarrow for your teeth!
Come on, lucky sixes!
Everybody, this is Paolo.
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica -Hi.
-and Joey -Hi.
-and Ross.
Hi.
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
So, where did Paolo come from?
Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight.
Suddenly, into our lives.
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
Isn't that funny?
That is funny.
And Rachel keeps touching him.
I looked all over and couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?
Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
All right.
Okay.
What next?
Blow a bubble.
A bubble's good.
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.
Here we go.
Nice going, imp!
It's okay.
All I need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth.
Good save!
We 're back on track and I'm chewing someone else 's gum.
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
And now you 're choking.
You all right?
My God!
You' re choking!
-Better?
-Yes.
Thank you.
That was.
-That was.
-Perfection?
That was no tousle.
-What'd he say that was so funny?
-I have absolutely no idea.
That's classic.
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?
This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
But I won't.
The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting than weeks with Barry.
Did you rent mopeds?
Because I've heard Oh, it's not about that right now.
I know it's superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language, but, God!
-Paolo, hi.
-Ross.
Listen.
Listen, something you should know.
Rachel and I are.
We' re kind of a thing.
-Thing?
-Thing.
Yes, thing.
-You have the sex?
-No.
No, technically the sex is not being had.
But that's.
But that's not the point.
The point is that Rachel and I should be.
Well, Rachel and l should be together.
And if you get in the -ln bed -No.
No, not where I was going.
If you get in the way of us becoming a thing then I would be, well, very sad.
So, do you?
-So you do know a little English?
-Little.
-Do you know the word "crap-weasel "?
-No.
That's funny.
You are a huge crap-weasel.
We've been doing this for an hour.
It's easy.
Ready?
Okay?
Now try it.
You gotta whip it.
Look, look.
The last candle's about to burn out.
T en, nine, eight, seven minus 46, minus 47, minus 48.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
IKind of spooky without any lights.
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
This probably isn't the best time to bring it up but you have to throw a party for Monica.
-This has been fun.
-Yes.
Thanks for letting me use your phone and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.
See you.
Hi, l' m account number 71 43457.
I don't know if you got that but I would really like a copy of the tape.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hey, gorgeous!
How's it going?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights.
Does it get better than this?
Question: Are you dating anyone?
I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Perfect might be a problem.
Had you said codependent or self-destructive.
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.
He is cute.
-He's funny.
He's -He's a he?
Well, yeah.
Oh, God!
I just You' re nice Oh, God.
Good, Shelly.
I' m gonna flush myself down the toilet now.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
The One Where Nana Dies Twice It's hard to enjoy noodles after that.
Is that ridiculous?
Can you believe she actually thought that?
Yeah.
When I first met you, I thought maybe possibly you might be.
You did?
You spent Phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts so I figured maybe not.
Did any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
-I did.
-I think so, yeah.
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.
Although back in college, Susan Saladore did.
You' re kidding.
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.
I wanted to go out with her too.
I told her you were seeing Bernie Spellman who also liked her.
Well, this is fascinating.
So what is it about me?
I don't know.
You' re smart, you' re funny.
So is Ross.
Ever think that about him?
-Yeah, right!
-What is it?
I don't know.
You just You have a quality.
-Yes, exactly.
-Yeah, a quality.
"A quality.
" Good.
I was worried you were gonna be vague about this.
I think this is gonna work for you.
-Excuse me?
-Sure, sure.
Women find you less threatening, they let their guards down you' re like a stealth heterosexual.
-It's Paolo calling from Rome.
-Oh, my God!
Calling from Rome!
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.
Just gotta go to Rome.
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?
I'm talking to Rome.
I'm talking to Rome.
Hey, Dad.
What's up?
Oh, God.
Ross, it's Nana.
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.
So how is she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
-How are you, Mom?
-Me?
I' m fine, fine.
I' m glad you' re here.
-What's with your hair?
-What?
-What's different?
-Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
-She's unbelievable.
Her mother's -Okay, relax.
We' re gonna be here a while.
We still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh, God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Yeah, they were gross.
You know what I love?
Her Sweet 'N Lows.
How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
Not just from restaurants, from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phylis now.
Aunt Phylis is dead?
Yeah, for like six years.
Where were?
Can we focus, please?
Goodbye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Nurse!
What is going on?
You know how the nurse said Nana had passed?
Well, she's not quite.
What?
She's not passed!
She's present!
She's back!
What's going on?
She may have died.
She may have died?
We're looking into it.
I'll go see.
This almost never happens.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay?
Is it my hair?
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So did she?
Twice.
-Twice?
-Oh, that sucks.
-You guys okay?
-I don't know.
It's weird.
I know she's gone, but I just don't feel.
Maybe she's not really gone.
No, no, she's gone.
We checked.
A lot.
No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.
Ever since my mom died, every now and then I get this feeling that she's right here, you know?
And Debbie, my friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.
I always get this strong Debbie vibe when I use a little yellow pencil.
-I miss her.
-Here, Pheebs.
Want this?
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.
I just sharpened her this morning.
I don't believe any of that.
When you' re dead you' re dead.
You' re gone.
You' re worm food.
So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Dad, let's just make a decision.
You're right.
It's going into the ground.
We should get the most basic thing.
"The non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate.
" Dad, we can't bury Nana in a dresser from kea.
This is why your mother buys my clothes.
I hate to shop.
I hate it.
Isn't this more about the fact that once you decide, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone?
No, I really hate to shop.
-I thought it'd be a closed casket.
-lt doesn't mean she can't look nice.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer.
I was just thinking -when my time comes -Dad.
Listen to me.
When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.
Define "fun.
" Come on.
You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch.
And then we throw your body in the water.
Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says I'm so predictable.
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, " Buried at sea?
Huh?
" That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.
Look, l' m sorry about yesterday.
Don't worry.
Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.
Okay.
Phew!
So, what do you think it is about me?
I don't know what.
You just have -a quality.
-A quality.
Great.
It's a shame.
You and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell?
Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?
What?
He's cute.
Well, yeah.
He's no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian?
I don't know.
If you were gonna set me up I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.
Brian's a little out of your league.
Excuse me.
You don't think I could get a Brian?
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.
I'm really not.
This one?
I've shown you every dress we have.
Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit go with the burgundy.
Whatever we pick, she'd say it's the wrong one.
Right.
We'll go with the burgundy.
A fine choice.
I'm coming out.
Wait!
We need shoes.
-How about these?
-That's really a day shoe.
Where she's going everyone else will be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something silver that may work.
-No, it really should be burgundy.
-Unless we go with a different dress.
No, no, no.
Watch this.
Wait, I may have something in the back.
Oh, my God.
Is everything all right?
Just Nana's stuff.
You guys ready?
Mom called to tell me not to wear my hair up.
-Know my ears aren't my best feature?
-Some days it's all I can think about.
I' m sorry l' m late.
I couldn't find my bearings.
You mean your earrings?
What did I say?
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes.
Paolo sent them from ltaly.
What?
We don't have shoes here?
-Morning.
We ready to go?
-Don't we look nice all dressed up?
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
-lt was a really beautiful service.
-lt really was.
Come here, sweetheart.
You know, I think it's time for you to start using night cream.
What?
Nothing.
Just that your coat sounds like Brent Musberger.
-Check it out.
Giants-Cowboys.
-You're watching football at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game.
I' m gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no!
My new Paolo shoes!
I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day!
What?
Weather-wise.
I know.
The air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost life Ross, are you okay?
No, l' m fine.
Just having my worst fear realized, but.
I' m just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.
-What?
What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie.
I took these when I had my gall thing accident.
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry.
Hi, l' m Andrea.
I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Look who's up!
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.
I feel great.
I feel great.
Wow, those pills really worked.
Yeah.
Not the first two, but the second two.
I love you guys.
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.
I love Pheebs.
That's so nice.
I love you, man.
And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay!
It doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
I do love you.
Oh, Ross.
I love you too.
Oh, no, I really love you.
I really love you.
Oh, you don't get it!
-What do you got there?
-Just a hearing disability.
What's the score?
Three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Your grandmother would've hated this.
Sure.
What with it being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham.
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
Or she'd say: "Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, l' m dead.
" That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
I can imagine.
It's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.
That is a wonder.
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again I mean, if she was here right now would you tell her?
T ell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.
Like your hair, for example.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Some things are better left unsaid.
It's nicer when people just get along.
More wine?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Thank you.
They're yours.
Actually, they were Nana's.
Now l' m depressed!
Even more than I was.
Oh, look.
My first grade picture.
Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.
-Hey, who's this little naked guy?
-That little naked guy would be me.
Look at the little thing!
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?
Who are those people?
-Got me.
-That's Nana right there in the middle.
Yeah, let's see.
" Me and the gang at Java Joe's.
" You look just like your grandmother.
How old was she?
Let's see, " 1 939.
" Twenty-four, twenty-five.
It looks like a fun gang.
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!
Let me see!
No, no.
That would be me again.
I'm just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, hey, Chandler.
So how's it going in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mache heads.
How about you?
Good.
Good.
Listen I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but I' m not.
I know.
That's what I told her.
Really?
So you can tell?
Pretty much.
Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.
So you don't think I have a quality?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no.
By the way, your friend Brian, from Payroll?
He is.
-He is?
-And way out of your league.
Out of my league!
I could get a Brian.
If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
Hey, Brian.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $1 00 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job.
" Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You' re a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
-What?
No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You' re wrong.
-I am not wrong.
-You' re wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I' m calling Mom.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department: Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny.
I was thinking you look more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.
So you' re gonna be one of those healthy guys?
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know.
-Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
-Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to I'll work on the lumps.
-Joey, you' re going home?
-Yeah.
Chandler, you' re still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
-Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Only $1 02 to go.
-I thought it was 98.
50?
Yeah, well, it was, but l I broke a cup, so.
-Well, l' m off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi.
Is Carol here?
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but.
-Come in.
-Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes.
I'm familiar with the concept.
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You' re not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just Do you talk about me?
-Yeah.
All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you as " Bobo the Sperm Guy.
" If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can hear everything.
-Really?
-I'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
T omato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-It's a yam.
-Hello.
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.
-Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
-Yeah, right!
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.
You' re amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be -What's wrong?
-I have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
-What?
-Saw what?
No, we' re just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"T onight, on a very special Blossom.
" Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming.
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, l' m gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them.
It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, l' m sorry!
I just I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
-I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
-I can't!
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you' re ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but.
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Hello.
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys.
" No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys?
" No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys!
" Do either of you have the keys?
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!
-Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
-Joey.
-That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major.
" So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus.
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing Please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
How's it going?
Here we come Walking down the street Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet Hey, hey -Hey, did you just feel that?
-I did.
-Does it always?
-That was the first.
IKeep singing!
IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you 're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we 'll go to the zoo -lt did it again!
-I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts This is great.
It's 5:00.
My plane is pulling away from the gate.
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!
If l' m gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right.
Listen, smirky!
If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this right now.
But l' m not!
You said you had the keys!
No, I didn't!
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!
That's it!
Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!
Why would I have the keys?
!
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!
-You should've.
-Why?
-Because!
-Why?
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
No!
No!
No!
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his T ots It's my first Thanksgiving, and l It's all burnt, and I can't.
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open.
Here we go.
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
-No Well, the turkey's burnt!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come Walking down the This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy.
You got one!
-Don't yell at me.
You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Skiing.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
Shoop.
-Eww.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
-By all means.
-All right.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be together.
I guess what l' m trying to say is that I' m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
All right!
You guys, it's starting to snow.
And look, Ugly Naked Guy is hanging candy canes.
Where?
Oh.
Well.
That's festive.
Guys, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
Wait, wait.
What is that?
-That's Marcel.
Wanna say hi?
-No, I don't.
-He's cute!
Where'd you get him?
-My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.
That is so cruel.
Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.
Is he gonna live with you in your apartment?
Yeah.
It's been kind of quiet since Carol left.
Why not get a roommate?
You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet That's " pathet.
" Sanskrit for " really cool way to live.
" The One With the Monkey I' m doing new material tonight.
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman.
You might wanna open with the snowman.
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.
How could you not?
You were Santa last year.
Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his helpers.
It's just such a slap in the face, you know?
Do you know what you' re doing for New Year's?
Hey, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?
You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops!
Man, I'm talking loud!
Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's.
-I'll be just as pathetic as you.
-Yeah, you wish.
I've got an idea.
Dinner.
It's perfect.
We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.
I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, we make a pact.
Just the six of us.
Dinner.
-Sure.
-Fine.
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.
-Phoebe, you' re on.
-Oh, good.
Hi.
Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi.
Thanks.
Hi.
I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitching How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar And sometimes when it's freezing I feel a little sneezy And now I Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Yeah, noisy boys.
Is it something you'd like to share with the group?
No.
No, that's okay.
If it's important enough while I'm playing it's important enough for everyone else.
That guy's going home with a note.
-I was just saying -Speak up.
Sorry, l I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.
I said I liked her in Splash, but not Wall Street.
I thought she had a hard quality.
While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace.
Then that's when you started yelling.
We're gonna take a short break.
That guy's going home with more than a note.
Come here, Marcel.
Sit here.
I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.
By my sixth date with Paolo, he'd already named both my breasts.
Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.
Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.
I just wanna be with him all the time.
You know, day and night.
And night and day.
And special occasions.
I see.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
-She's gonna break the pact.
-No!
No, no.
No.
Yeah, could I just?
-Yeah.
I already asked Janice.
-What?
This was a pact!
This was your pact!
I couldn't handle the pressure.
I snapped!
But that was the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes.
Must mock Joey.
Nice shoes, huh?
God, you're killing me!
Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you always have to bring him?
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
We had our first fight this morning.
It has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean.
He threw some feces.
If you're working late, I can look in on him.
That would be great!
But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.
You're not doing it for me.
Okay.
But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
But you can't actually test this theory.
T oday's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough -to simulate these conditions.
-I have a question then.
-Yeah?
-Do you plan on kissing me ever?
That's definitely a valid question, and the answer would be yes.
Yes, I was.
But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment because it's you.
Sure.
The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l sweep everything off the table.
And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.
I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
-Really?
-I'm sure.
You should just do it.
Just throw me.
-Now?
-Yeah, right now.
Just.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You know what?
This is really expensive.
And this was a gift.
-Now you' re just tidying up.
-Okay.
-You want me to throw you?
-I can hop.
T ell me something, what does " no-date pact" mean to you?
It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-Yeah.
-You know more than one Fun Bobby?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.
-Okay.
Here we go.
-There's no room for milk.
There.
Now there is.
So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
-Four.
-Five.
Sorry.
Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
And I met this really hot single mom at the store.
What's an elf to do?
So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?
We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
I'll know.
This is so not what I needed right now.
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's Marcel.
He's angry with me.
I have no idea why.
He keeps shutting me out.
He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
That's weird.
I had a blast with him.
-Really?
-We played, watched TV.
That juggling thing is amazing.
What juggling thing?
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.
No.
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just socks.
And a melon.
-Phoebe!
-Max.
Do you know everybody?
No.
Have you seen David?
He hasn't been around.
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.
-Minsk?
-Minsk.
It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant.
Three years, all expenses paid.
And if you're gonna do Minsk, that's the way to go.
-So when do you leave?
-January 1 st.
-Hello?
-What?
Hey.
Hi.
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.
Congratulations!
This is so exciting!
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going?
Oh, why?
T ell her.
" I don't wanna go to work with Lipson, Yamaguchi and Flank.
I wanna stay and make out with my girlfriend!
" Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.
So you're really not going?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just.
How can I leave you?
I just found you.
Oh, David.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
You decide.
-Don't do that.
-But l' m asking you.
-I can't make a decision.
Just -Okay.
Stay.
-Stay.
-Stay.
Getting so good at that!
It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing.
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.
You remember Janice.
Vividly.
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.
Now.
It's amazing.
We've been back together for what -Iike 1 0 minutes, and -ls that all?
It's like we were never apart.
Of course, we were, but Forgive and forget.
Well, forget.
-Hi.
-Hi, l' m Sandy.
Sandy, hi.
Come on in.
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah.
That's okay, right?
-Party!
-That thing is not coming in here!
This is how you greet guests?
If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome?
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here Iike nothing happened All right.
All right.
Just keep him away from me.
Thank you.
Come on, Marcel.
What do you say you and I mingle?
All right, I'll catch up with you later.
Oh, my gosh!
Rachel, honey, are you okay?
-Where's Paolo?
-Rome.
Jerk missed his flight.
And then your face exploded?
No.
Okay.
I was at the airport getting into a cab when this woman, this blond planet with a pocketbook starts yelling.
Something about how it was her cab first.
The next thing, she just starts pulling me out by my hair!
And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.
So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me!
And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.
Everybody having fun at the party?
-Are people eating my dip?
-Yes.
There.
-That looks okay, right?
-You went a bit wide on the lipstick.
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.
It's hard for me to tell.
My eye's closing up.
Let me get it for you.
-Ow!
-Okay.
You know what?
It looks fine.
Okay, here we go.
Screw Paolo, screw the psycho cab lady.
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.
All right, there you go.
This way.
Here you go.
When I saw you at the store last week it was the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.
Hey, kids.
He doesn't have to spend the whole evening with me but at least check in.
There you are!
You got away from me.
-But you found me.
-Here, Ross, take our picture.
Smile.
You' re on Janice Camera.
Kill me.
Kill me now.
Hi, l' m Rachel.
So whose friend are you?
Look at me, spilling everywhere.
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my grandfather died about two hours ago.
But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?
Whoa!
Who died?
It's gonna be an open casket, you know?
So at least I'll get to see him again.
Bobby?
Fun Bobby?
Let me talk to you for just a sec.
I recently lost a grandparent myself so I really know exactly how you feel.
But you' re really bringing the party down.
-l' m sorry.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.
There you go.
There you go.
I' m gonna blow this one up and write " Reunited " in glitter.
All right, Janice, that's it!
Janice.
Janice.
Hey, Janice, when I invited you, I didn't think it meant Oh, no!
I' m sorry you misunderstood.
You listen to me!
You listen to me!
One of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me!
Will you give me the thing?
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
-Wow.
-lt won't be the same but it will still be Minsk.
Happy New Year.
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, l' m fine.
I' m fine.
Come on.
-You' re going to Minsk.
-No, l' m not going to Minsk.
You are so going to Minsk.
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.
If I go, I have to break up with you.
-And I can't break up with you.
-Yes, you can.
Just say, " Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life.
That's what I have to do.
" And I say, "Your work?
How can you say that?
" Then you say, " I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?
" And I say, " No!
No!
I can't understand that!
" -Ow.
-Sorry.
And then you put your arms around me.
-Then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, sorry.
And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Then you say that you have to go because you don't wanna start the year with me if you can't finish it.
I' m gonna miss you, you scientist guy.
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.
We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.
It gets better every.
Here you go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me.
Please kiss me at midnight!
-You seen Sandy?
-I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom getting it on with Max.
Oh, I did know how to tell you.
-Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.
-What?
The ball is dropping!
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that no-date pact worked out.
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!
four, three, two one!
Happy New Year!
I thought I'd throw this out.
I' m no math whiz but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
-I can't kiss anyone.
-So, I'm kissing everyone?
No, you can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.
So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Somebody kiss me.
Somebody kiss me!
It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!
All right!
All right!
There!
I wanted this to work so much.
I'm still in there.
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.
But he's just phoning it in.
It's hard that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Do you think they have yesterday's Daily News?
I just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Oh, my God!
Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy who can break our hearts and plunge us into depression.
Come to mama.
He's coming.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Be cool.
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.
-We should do something.
Whistle.
-I' m not whistling.
Come on, do it!
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
I can't believe you did that.
The One With Mrs. Bing -It's all my fault.
-No, it's mine.
Why did I whoo-hoo?
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say " I Iove that sound.
I must have you now"?
I wish there was something we could do.
Hello, coma guy.
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!
What are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.
I hate that they're calling him John Doe.
It's so sad.
It's Iike he's a deer, a female deer.
Oh, I was gonna stop.
Look at that face.
Even sleeping he Iooks smart.
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles mean he's artistic.
Okay.
He's a Iawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.
And he can dance.
And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's Iistening not saying, " I understand " but really wondering what you Iook Iike naked.
I wish all guys could be Iike him.
I know.
You don't even know this guy.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
He doesn't have anyone.
We feel kind of responsible.
I can't believe you said "whoo-hoo.
" I don't even say "whoo-hoo.
" Oh, she's coming up.
When we return, we 'll talk with the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
Put the kids to bed for this one.
Don't watch this.
Weekend at Bernie 's is on Showtime and HBO.
No way.
-She's your mom.
-Exactly.
Weekend at Bernie 's.
Dead guy getting hit in the groin 20, 30 times.
I gotta tell you, I Iove your mom's books.
I can't get on a plane without one.
This is so cool.
You wouldn't think so if you were 1 1 and your friends were passing around page 79 of Mistress Bitch.
I remember page 79.
The thing after the opera with the girl with the trick hip?
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a blast.
That's because she's not your mom.
Oh, please.
She's the Hi, sweetie.
When did " Rigatoni " get back from Rome?
-Last night.
-Really?
So, his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?
Just a dream I had.
But, phew!
Hey, she's on.
Nora Bing.
Back to the book.
What is this about you being arrested in London?
Your mom was arrested?
I'm busy beaming with pride.
This is kind of embarrassing but occasionally, after I've been intimate with a man Why would she say that's embarrassing?
I just get this craving for kung pao chicken.
That's too much information.
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.
Oh, God, I Iove her!
I think I' m having a stroke.
So how is your book tour going?
Oh, fine.
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.
But I get to see my son, who I love.
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.
Don 't take this wrong, I just don 't see you as a mom.
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no.
I'm a fabulous mom.
I bought my son his first condoms.
And then he burst into flames.
Let's see.
Congress is debating a new deficit-reduction bill.
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.
And teams played sports.
What about GIen?
He could be a GIen.
Not special enough.
How about Agamemnon?
Way too special.
I'm famished.
What do I want?
PIease, God, don't Iet it be kung pao chicken.
You watched the show.
What did you think?
I think you need to come out of your shell.
What is this dive?
Only you could've picked this place.
Come on.
Shut up.
It's fun.
Give me a hug.
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?
Well, you know what they say: Be careful what you wish for.
-I think we' re ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.
There you go.
Ross?
I' m not really a shot-drinking kind of guy.
Hi.
Sorry we' re Iate.
We kind of just, you know, Iost track of time.
But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Well, I' m gonna go to tinker-town.
Mrs. Bing, I've read everything you've written.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight, I wanted to become a writer.
Oh, please.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Start with half a dozen European cities throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia and you've got yourself a book.
My mother, Iadies and gentlemen.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah.
I' m fine.
What is with you tonight?
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
Okay, thank you.
It's the Italian hand-Iicker, isn't it?
No.
It's the one he's Iicking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You' re good.
I have sold 1 00 million copies of my books, and you know why?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No, because I know how to write men that women fall in Iove with.
I cannot sell a Paolo.
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo.
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.
He's just a complication you eventually kill off.
When?
He's not a hero.
You know who our hero is?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you.
-PIease.
-No, really.
Come on.
You' re smart.
You' re sexy.
-Right.
-Yes, you are.
The fact that you don't think you are makes you sexier.
Come on, kiddo.
You' re gonna be fine, believe me.
I'II just pee in the street.
Is Chandler here?
Wait.
Come here.
Okay, about Iast night you know Chandler, you didn't tell.
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss.
No big deal, right?
Right.
No big deal.
In bizarro world.
You broke the code.
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.
But not a mom.
Never a mom.
What are you guys doing out here?
Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.
But apparently somebody overslept.
Well, you don't have your racquet.
No.
No, I don't because it's being restrung.
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Well, you didn't call and Ieave your grip size.
You guys are spending way too much time together.
I' m scum.
I' m scum.
-How could you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.
It's not Iike she's a regular mom.
She's sexy.
She's.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well, not in the same way.
I'II have you know, GIoria T ribbiani was a handsome woman in her day.
You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here.
What are you doing here?
Not playing racquetball.
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.
Sounds Iike you two have issues.
Goodbye, baby.
Do they wait for me to do this?
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?
If you don't, his mother might.
What are you guys doing here?
He's not even wearing a jock strap.
What did I ask?
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I just thought I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.
So, what are you doing here?
I' m not really here.
I just thought I'd drop these off on the way.
My way.
Do you come here a Iot without me?
No, no, no.
Do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know?
I wasn't here.
Really?
Not even to change his pajamas?
Oh, my God.
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.
I can't believe it.
Paolo kissed my mom?
I don't know if you noticed, but he drank a Iot.
I mean, you know how he gets I can't do this.
I did it.
It was me.
I' m sorry.
I kissed your mom.
What?
I was upset about Rachel and I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was being nice.
But nothing happened.
Nothing.
Ask Joey.
-Joey came in -You knew about this?
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're Iucky I caught them, or else who knows what would've happened?
Thanks, man.
Big help.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't.
I don't know.
I No one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this.
-Me neither.
-I' m mad at you too.
-Why are you mad at me?
-Let me slam the door.
I didn't kiss her.
See what happens when you break the code?
"A Woman Undone, by Rachel IKaren Greene.
" I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.
Do you think his "Iove stick" can be "Iiberated from its denim prison"?
Yeah, I'd say so.
And there's no "J " in "engorged.
" -You going to the hospital tonight?
-No.
You?
No.
You?
You just asked me.
Maybe it was a trick question.
Rachel, can we do this now?
I am so hot.
Here's my mom and dad on their wedding day.
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.
-I can't believe this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks.
I'd Iike to start with a song about a man I recently met who's come to be very important to me.
You don 't have to be awake To be my man Long as you have brain waves I'll be there to hold your hand Though we just met the other day There 's something I have got to say Thank you very much.
I' m gonna take a short break.
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started I was talking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?
" Mother-kisser.
" I'II shut up.
I know you' re still mad at me but there were two people there that night.
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Then why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated.
It's complex.
You kissed my mom.
We' re rehearsing a Greek play.
That's funny.
Are we done now?
You mean you' re not gonna tell her how you feel?
Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her.
You can't talk to her.
Okay.
"You can't"?
Or you can't?
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.
Still doing the play.
What did you do with him?
-You're awake.
-Look at you.
How do you feel?
A Iittle woozy, but basically okay.
Gosh, you Iook good.
I feel good.
Who are you?
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.
I' m Monica.
I've been caring for you.
We both have.
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-Actually, me.
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.
-I read to you.
-I sang.
Well, thanks.
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You' re welcome.
So I guess I'II see you around.
What?
That's it?
"See you around "?
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.
Maybe "That was nice.
" " It meant something to me.
" " I'II call you.
" -Okay.
I'II call you.
-I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical.
You know, we give and we give and we give.
And we just get nothing back.
And then one day, you wake up, and it's, "See you around.
" Let's go, Phoebe.
You know what?
We thought you were different.
But I guess it was just the coma.
The car's waiting.
I just wanted to drop off my book for your friends.
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.
Here's the kiss, here's the goodbye.
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you' re there is enough.
AII right.
Well, be good.
I Iove you.
You kissed my best Ross.
Or something to that effect.
Look, it was stupid.
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.
I don't even know how it happened.
I' m sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.
Really, really stupid.
Really, really stupid.
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.
No.
The forbidden Iove of a man and his door.
He told her off.
And not just about the kiss.
You're kidding?
He said, "When are you gonna start being a mom?
" Then she said: "The question is, when are you gonna realize I have a bomb?
" Are you sure she didn't say: "When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?
" -That makes more sense.
-You think?
What's going on now?
I don't know.
I've been standing here spelling it out for you.
I don't hear anything.
Wait.
What do you see?
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.
Wait, wait, wait.
They're walking away.
They're walking away.
No, they' re not.
They' re coming right at us.
Run!
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I' m okay.
AII right.
You be good.
Drive safe.
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.
You mean that?
Yeah, why not?
So I told her.
-How did it go?
-Awful.
Awful.
Couldn't have gone worse.
-Well, how do you feel?
-Pretty good.
I told her.
Well, see?
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, me kissing your mom, huh?
But we don't have to go down that road.
This is just the first chapter and I want your absolute honest opinion.
Okay?
And on page two, he's not reaching for her " heaving beasts.
" She could have heaving beasts.
Right, but in this case she doesn't.
What's a " niffle"?
You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.
Okay, so I' m not a great typist.
Did you get to the part about his "huge, throbbing pens"?
You don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.
That's it.
Give them back.
Wait, I just got to the part about her "public hair.
"
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
No, no, we're done!
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas Aunt Silv, stop yelling!
If you'd told me vegetarian lasagna I would've made vegetarian lasagna.
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
You could plunk me down in any woman's uterus, no compass and I could find my way out like that!
This is cool.
It says in some parts of the world people eat the placenta.
And we're done with the yogurt.
Sorry.
I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.
What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Ross, listen.
Do you know that right now your baby is only this big?
This is your baby.
" Hi, Daddy.
" Hello.
" How come you don't live with Mommy?
" " How come Mommy lives with that other lady?
" "What's a lesbian?
" Honey, you can say it.
Poconos.
Poconos.
It's like " poke a nose.
" Poke a nose.
-So did I hear Poconos?
-Yes.
My sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
First weekend together.
-It's a big step.
-I know.
-It's just a weekend.
Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?
Shouldn't it be flung by now?
We are way past a "fling.
" I' m feeling things I've read about in Danielle Steel books.
When l' m with him, l' m just totally.
Nauseous.
I' m physically nauseous.
What am I supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?
I could call lmmigration.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy is making shadow puppets.
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.
Oh, right!
Go.
Go!
I love babies with their little baby shoes and their little baby toes and their little hands.
Okay, you' re gonna have to stop that.
Forever.
Need a new table.
You think?
-Come on in.
-Hello.
I brought the books and Monica sends her love along with this lasagna.
Great!
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.
I' m pretty sure that it is.
Nineteen weeks, the breasts are starting to swell.
According to the literature.
-I got the results of the amnio.
-T ell me.
Is everything?
-T otally and completely healthy.
-That is great!
When did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
That's our friend T anya.
Of course, it's your friend T anya.
-Don't you wanna know about the sex?
-The sex?
I' m having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together.
But when you throw in T anya.
The sex of the baby, Ross.
You know the sex of the baby?
-Want to know?
-No.
I don't want to.
Absolutely not.
You shouldn't know until you look down there and see, " Oh, there it is.
" Or isn't.
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.
So?
So did you hear?
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Okay.
Oh, that's so cool!
It really is.
Do we know?
We certainly do.
It's going to be a Hello?
A guy who doesn't wanna know is standing here.
Well, is it what we thought it would be?
What?
What did we think it'd be?
I don't wanna know.
Don't wanna know.
I should probably just go.
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.
Okay.
Susan.
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?
Hello?
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.
Because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
-That's the rule.
-What rule?
There's no rule.
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?
It was fine until your breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecio.
You knew about that?
The impressions in the butter left little to the imagination.
How about if we split it?
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.
-Do you think we' re ready for that?
-Why not?
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?
-You' re moving out?
-l' m not.
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.
-It's just, with my last roommate -I know all about Kip.
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off and got married.
Things got ugly.
Let me ask you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?
Oh, don't do that.
There's changes in your schedule.
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:30.
And Miss Summerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Thanks.
Oh, here comes your 3:00.
I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but Yum!
Paolo!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Rachella tell me you massage?
Well, Rachella's right.
Oh, okay.
I don't know what you just said, so let's start.
I am being naked?
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to take off Being naked!
I can't believe you don't wanna know.
I couldn't not know.
If the doctor knows, Carol and Susan know And Monica knows.
How?
I don't even know.
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna.
She told me.
So what's it gonna be?
-Oh, great!
Now he knows.
-l' m just excited about being an aunt.
Or an uncle.
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.
Fine!
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
I' m just out of sorts.
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
I rarely use them.
Can we get some cappuccino over here?
Oh, right!
That's me!
That table place closes at 7.
Come on.
Fine.
What is it?
-All right.
You know Paolo?
-l' m familiar with his work.
He made a move on me.
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.
Well, what happened?
He came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?
Oh, yeah.
I' m sure.
And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it?
Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
Wow.
-What did you do?
-I dealt with it like a professional.
" Ooh, " what?
ma Thurman.
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!
Thanks, Rach.
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.
It's your moral obligation as a friend, as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.
Guys?
-You have to.
-Feminist issue?
That's where I went.
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well.
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.
So what?
Like people will come in and think, " Oh, l' m outside again.
" Fine.
What about the birds?
I don't know.
They don't say, " Hello, sit here.
Eat something.
" -You pick one.
-Okay.
How about the ladybugs?
Forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining.
-Fine!
Want the birds?
Get the birds!
-Not like that, I won't.
Kip would have liked the birds.
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?
-Are you moving out?
-l' m getting ready for the weekend.
Are your weekends longer than two days?
These aren't all my suitcases.
This one's Paolo's.
-Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
-Well, sure.
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.
We haven't known each other that long.
There are three things you should know: One, my friends are the most important thing in my life.
Two, I never lie.
And three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Okay.
Thanks, Pheebs.
-Oh, my God!
-I know.
Why have I never tasted these?
I don't make them a lot, because it's not fair to the other cookies.
These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies.
-Which proves that I never lie.
-I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
What do you think?
It's the most beautiful table I've seen.
I know.
Will you balance plates on these heads?
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.
Come on!
Heads up, Ross.
Score!
You suck!
Are you okay?
I need some mik.
Okay.
I've got milk.
Here you go.
Better?
No.
I feel so stupid!
I think about the other day with you guys.
And I was all, " Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!
He makes me feel so" God!
I' m so embarrassed!
I' m so embarrassed.
-l' m the one he hit on.
-I unleashed him on you.
If I had never met him -l' m so sorry.
-No, l' m sorry.
-l' m sorry.
-l' m sorry.
Wait.
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.
Right.
He's the pig.
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!
He's like a big disgusting pig.
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!
But he was my pig man!
How did I not see this?
Oh, I know!
Because he's gorgeous.
And he's charming.
-And when he looks -Okay, Pheebs.
The end.
God.
Should I not have told you?
T rust me, it's much better that I know.
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.
She took it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so.
We should go and see if she's okay.
Just one second.
-Score!
-Game!
Nice!
Come on, Pheebs.
Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.
She did.
You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.
Come on.
Two on one.
Why are you here?
She just broke up with him.
It's time for you to swoop in.
-What, now?
-Yes.
Now is when you swoop.
When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.
She's gotta know you' re everything he's not.
You' re the anti-Paolo.
My Catholic friend is right.
She's distraught.
You' re there for her.
You pick up the pieces and then you usher in "The Age of Ross.
" -See this?
See?
-Hold it!
Ascolta!
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.
That is, " How could you?
" or " Enormous breasts!
" Here he comes.
I am to say goodbye.
Okay, bye-bye.
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did, but I still have five of these so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
I just wanna tell you, and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say.
Oh, just look at her.
Guys, I think only one of us should go -so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.
And I really think it should be me.
You all right?
I've been better.
I don't believe this.
I wasn't supposed to care about this guy.
It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing.
Someday I could look back and say, "That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.
" It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over.
Come here.
Listen you deserve so much better than him.
I mean, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
What?
I' m so sick of guys!
I don't want to look at or think about another guy.
I don't even want to be near another guy.
Ross, you' re so great.
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?
-Medium.
Any cookies left?
-Yeah.
See, Rach I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.
What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
I just need to be by myself for a while.
-I just gotta figure out what I want.
-No, no.
See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.
No, I know.
I know.
And l' m sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.
-What?
-What?
I' m having a boy?
No.
No.
In fact, you' re not having a boy.
I' m having a boy.
-Huh?
Am I having a boy?
-You' re having a boy!
I' m having a boy!
-l' m having a boy!
-What is it?
I' m having a boy!
I' m having a boy!
We already knew that!
I' m having a son.
Yes!
And that would be a shutdown!
Shutout!
Where you going?
One more game!
-It's 2:30 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!
You guys always hang out in my apartment.
I'll only use my left hand.
Come on, wussies!
All right!
Okay!
I gotta go!
I' m going.
And l' m gone.
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!
You barge in here and you don't knock?
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?
!
That's a relatively open weave.
I can still see your nippular areas.
The One With The Boobies Honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are other things.
When the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
-But you tell it really well, sweetie.
-Thanks.
Okay.
Now go away so we can talk about you.
Okay.
I'll miss you.
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute.
He likes you so much.
I know.
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?
And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky.
Think you'll do it on his couch?
I don't know.
That's a little weird.
It's vinyl.
Okay, you guys want anything else?
-Could I have?
-We're all out.
Anybody else?
Did I miss something?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
What were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident.
I wasn't across the street with a telescope.
Can we change the subject, please?
These aren't her "boobies".
These are her breasts.
Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
I always liked "Bazoombas".
Gives them a Latin spin.
Can we drop this already, please?
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.
"Nice"?
They were "nice"?
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice".
Okay.
Rock, hard place.
Me.
You're so funny!
He's really funny.
I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops.
Whoa, back up there, sparky.
What did you mean by that?
It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.
Only child, right?
Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.
I got a job.
I'm better off staying with Joey than going back and forth on the ferry.
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.
-Good to meet you.
-You too.
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?
Chandler, say something funny.
I gotta go.
Miss you too.
-I love you, but it's getting late -Say hi.
Hey, Ma.
I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and Excuse me?
Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni.
She's a pet mortician.
Sure.
So, how long you been?
Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the navy yard?
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.
I wanted you to think of a nice memory so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garlic.
You don't crush it?
You're having an affair, I chop garlic.
It's a wacky world.
Joe, you ever been in love?
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.
Your dad's in love.
The worst part is, it's with two different women.
Oh, man!
Please tell me one of them is Ma.
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?
It's like if you woke up and found out your dad leads this double life.
He's like actually some spy working for the ClA.
That'd be cool.
This blows!
Do you think Dad cheated?
I don't think so.
That would involve sex.
I'd like to think that our parents don't do that.
I know.
Why can't parents just stay parents?
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have?
Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What?
What?
Didn't you get a good enough look?
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.
Since you saw her boobies you have to show her your pee-pee.
You know, I don't see that happening.
Come on.
He's right.
Tit for tat.
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!
Come on up.
Oh, good!
Rog is here.
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing.
I hate that guy!
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.
Come on, he's not that bad.
You're wrong!
Why would I marry her if I thought that she was a lesbian?
I don't know.
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Why?
Why would l?
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling.
Maybe Wait!
Go back to that "sibling" thing.
Well, I don't know.
You could've sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would feel like less of a failure.
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?
Yeah.
No, that's not what I was saying.
I thought you were on my side.
But maybe you sucked up to them so they'd favor you.
I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right.
I mean, you're right.
It wasn't just the Weebles, but the Weeble Play Palace and the Weeble's Cruise Ship with this lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
And Mom just gave them all away.
That's tough, tough stuff.
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.
-Feel better.
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.
Listen, it was great seeing you again.
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?
Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
I hate that guy!
Good night, you guys.
Oh, look.
It's the woman we ordered.
Hey, can we help you?
No, thanks.
I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, no, not you.
Big Joey.
Oh, my God!
You're so much cuter than your pictures.
I'm Ronni.
Cheese Nip?
Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip.
Most people, when their pets pass on want them like they're sleeping.
Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.
Like chasing their tail.
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
-That's a good one!
-Hey.
Hey, Dad.
Ronni's here.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Hello, babe!
What are you doing here?
Oh, you left your hair at my place.
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.
Thank you.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I shouldn't have come.
I better go.
I'll miss the train.
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay?
Here?
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.
If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.
I want you here so I can keep an eye on you.
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.
As long as you are under my roof you're gonna live by my rules.
That means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow, he's strict.
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.
And Chandler will be?
Out here with me, bunking up.
Oh, bunking up.
If you smell s'mores, don't be alarmed.
Thanks.
You're a good kid.
I'll show you to my room.
That sounds weird not followed by, "No, it's late".
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.
Change?
-Break up with Ronni -I can't!
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!
Hey, kickie!
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.
I was thinking about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.
Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes?
You know, how I date all these women.
I always figured, when the right one comes along I'll be able to go the distance.
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking You're not him, you're you.
When they wanted you in your father's business, did you cave?
-No.
-No.
You chose the out-of-work-actor business.
That wasn't easy, but you did it.
I believe when the right woman comes along you'll have the guts to say, "No, thanks, I'm married".
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I really do.
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!
-Hi.
-Hi.
May I help you?
Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler's in ours.
Okay.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni.
Ronni Rapalono.
The mistress?
-Come on in.
-Thanks.
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's there.
Ronni, how long has Chandler been in the shower?
Oh, like five minutes.
Perfect.
Fasten your seat belts, it's pee-pee time.
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.
Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!
You were supposed to be in there so I'd see your thing!
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
-How's it going?
-Good.
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.
It's just.
It's Roger, you know?
There's something about We just feel that he's.
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.
Don't you think it's just that he's so perceptive it freaked you out?
No, we hate him!
I'm sorry.
-Ma!
What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!
Big ring!
Why'd you fill your father's head with garbage about making things right?
Things were fine this way!
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.
-Hold on.
You knew?
-Of course I knew.
What do you think?
Your father is no James Bond.
You should've heard his stories.
"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's".
-What is that?
Please!
-So then, how could you?
Do you remember how your father used to be?
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.
Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
Now he's happy.
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful but what the hell are you talking about?
-I mean, what about you?
-Me?
I'm fine.
Look, honey, in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.
And something else: Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.
He's been more loving.
It's like every day is our anniversary.
-I'm happy for you?
-Well, don't be!
Now everything's screwed up.
I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I just did what I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.
So tell me.
Did you see her?
Yeah.
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.
Could I take her?
With this ring, no contest.
Oh, no!
Don't ever do that!
-What?
-I'm sorry.
I have a thing, which means you can't ever do that!
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.
-No, what's wrong?
Come on.
-Okay.
It's nothing.
I'm fine.
It's just It's my friends.
They have a liking problem with you in that they don't.
They don't?
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good and sweet stuff.
-They think you're a little -What?
Intense and creepy.
-Oh.
-But I don't.
Me, Phoebe.
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.
It's quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, this kind of codependent, emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups which might as well have nipples on them.
And you're all like, "Oh, define me!
Define me!
Love me!
I need love!
You talked to your dad?
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted.
Ma will keep pretending she doesn't know.
And my sister, Tina, can't see her husband.
He got a restraining order.
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.
Things have changed here on Waltons'mountain.
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.
It's just You know, they're parents.
After a certain point, you gotta let go.
You gotta let them make their own mistakes.
And think, in a few years, we'll turn into them.
Oh, please.
If I turn into my parents, I'll be an alcoholic blond chasing men or I'll end up like my mom!
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.
-What happened?
-I don't know.
I mean he's a good person, and he can be really sweet.
In some ways, I think he is so right for me.
It's just.
I hate that guy!
Hi, Joey.
What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback.
Next stop, Rachel Greene.
Joey, what the hell were you doing?
Sorry, wrong boobies!
Hello, Joey!
Hello, dear!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ross, she wants you.
We just live in the same building.
-Any contact?
-She lent me an egg.
-You're in!
-Right.
Hey, Ross.
Come on.
Get back in the game.
The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian.
I don't think we need a third.
Could we get an egg, still in the shell?
An egg?
Go up to her and say, "I'm returning your egg".
I think it's winning.
-It's insane.
-She'll love it.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Here.
Go with the egg, my friend.
Go, go, go!
-Think it'll work?
-No way.
It's suicide.
The One With The Candy Hearts -You can't do this.
-Do what?
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No!
Remember why you dumped him?
Because he was creepy.
And mean.
And frightening.
Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
You can go out with a creep any night.
I know I do.
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-That depends on how tonight goes.
-About tonight -Don't you bail on me!
I said I'd bring a friend for her friend.
-But her friend sounds like a -Pathetic mess.
I know, but.
Come on.
She's needy, vulnerable.
I'm thinking.
Thanks.
You haven't been out with a woman since Janice.
You're doing this.
-She said yes.
-Way to go, man!
Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
I don't care.
There's Lorraine.
No trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey.
Well, well!
Look what you brought!
Very nice.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
I'm gonna wash the cab smell off of my hands.
Get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Janice!
?
Oh my God!
Hey, it's Janice!
Okay, I'm making a break for it!
I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine.
-Just calm down.
-Calm down?
You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous and.
I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Come on!
Do it, do it!
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete.
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.
The guy that used to cry every time we had sex?
"Was it good for you"?
I'd take crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy!
"I win!
I win"!
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're some kind of magnets.
I know I am.
That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
You know my friend who shaves her head?
No.
I have this friend who shaves her head.
She says to break the bad boyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual.
Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Yeah.
We can do it tomorrow night.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.
Okay, what kind of ritual?
We can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?
Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks.
Burning's good.
You know I can pick up quarters with my toes.
Yeah?
Good for you.
Quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures.
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's okay.
You could make little puppets out of them.
And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!
-We can't do that!
-What?
What can't you do?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?
We might be leaving now.
Tell me it's you and me "we".
She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off.
I'm not even sure what slathering is!
But I definitely want to be a part of it!
Okay, you cannot do this to me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Can we have three chocolate mousses to go?
I'm out of here.
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.
I hope she throws up on you.
Thanks.
-So.
-Just us.
What a crappy night!
I have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
So do we have the best friends, or what?
Joey's not a friend.
He's a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink?
Dessert?
A big-screen TV?
-I'll have a drink.
-Got it.
Good woman!
-A bottle of overpriced champagne.
-Each.
That's right, each.
And a rob roy.
I've always wanted to know.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, I miss you already.
-Can you believe this happened?
-No, no!
And yet it did.
-Goodbye, Janice.
-kiss me!
Oh, Chandler.
Sorry.
Oh, Chandler.
Sorry!
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.
Well, this was very special.
Rach, come see who's out here!
What's going on?
Oh, my God!
Janice!
Hi!
Janice is gonna go away now!
I'll be right back.
Joey!
Look who it is!
Good.
Joey's home.
This is so much fun!
This is like a reunion in the hall!
Ross, there's someone I want you to say hi to.
He happened to call.
Hi, Ross.
That's right, it's me!
How did you know?
So, if dogs experience jet lag because of the seven dog years to one human year thing when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses a week and a half.
That's funny!
They should be cooking the food soon.
Oh, good.
Who are they?
The blond is my ex-wife.
The woman touching her is her close, personal friend.
-They're lovers?
-lf you want to put a label on it.
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope.
That's it.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.
I always forget that part.
Hello!
Now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine.
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.
That's okay!
Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Yeah, okay!
Okay.
Barry's letters.
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked!
-Let me see!
-He's wearing a sweater.
-No.
-Whose MCl card is that?
-Mine.
Shoot!
Remember this number: Nine, seven, four.
Okay, and here we have the last of Paolo's grappa.
Wait, isn't it almost pure How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day?
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.
In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny valentine!
Hi, just Janice.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.
I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna.
If you don't do it, I will.
-So are you actually from New York?
-Not originally.
I'm from -You said they'd shoot it without you.
-I thought they could.
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.
Mini-pads should be that much easier.
-It's Valentine's Day.
-I know, but it's my job.
I'll try to get back as soon as I can.
I'm spending most of my time teaching science which is funny because that wasn't even my major.
Now, that is funny!
Do you think it would be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
Because she's alone now.
And pregnant.
And sad.
-I guess.
-Are you sure?
Carol!
-Wanna join us?
-No, I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will scooch down.
You guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching!
Come on!
-Come on.
-Thank you.
IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristen.
-How do you do?
-Carol teaches sixth grade.
And Kristen.
IKristen does something that, funnily enough wasn't even her major!
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at all.
It's pretty much our job.
That's why we get the cool hats.
-What do we got there?
-A piece of sik boxer shorts.
Some greeting cards.
A half-charred picture of.
That guy's hairier than the chief!
It's a really funny story how this happened.
I was taking out the trash, and Phoebe was burning incense It's all right.
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control.
-Third one tonight.
-Really?
Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Next time you're burning your ex-boyfriend's stuff: One, do it in a well-ventilated area.
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, stay away from synthetic fabrics.
Three, try to let go of the anger, and learn to love yourself.
-I brought you something.
-ls it loaded?
Oh, little candy hearts.
"Chan and Jan Forever".
I had them made special.
Okay, Janice.
Hey, Janice.
There's no way to tell you this.
At least, there's no new way.
I just don't think things are gonna work out.
That's fine.
It is?
Because I know that this isn't the end.
You see, actually, it is.
No, because you won't let that happen.
Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing!
Oh, no, I don't.
Why do we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?
-Valentine's, who asked who into bed?
-I did, but You seek me out!
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!
Janice!
Janice!
You push me away, you pull me back!
You want me.
You need me.
You can't live without me.
And you know it.
You just don't know you know it.
See?
Call me!
It's not true.
I never called your mother a wolverine.
You did so, I swear to How long has she been in the bathroom?
She isn't in the bathroom.
Her coat's gone.
Well, maybe it's cold in there.
I screwed up my first date in nine years.
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.
You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom.
Smile.
They won't all be like this.
Some might stay through dinner.
-I'm sorry.
That's not funny.
-It's just.
You know the whole "get on with your life" thing?
Well, do I have to?
I'm sitting here with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, but that that's it.
Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.
And I don't have to.
-I know.
-You know?
Here's a wacky thought.
Let's say you and I give it another shot.
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.
But what do you say we just put that aside for now.
Let's just stick a pin in it.
Because we're great together.
You can't deny it.
I've got a ring at home that fits you.
I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them.
And best of all, you're carrying my baby.
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross You keep saying that, but there's something right here.
I love you.
I love you too.
-But -No "but".
You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?
It's time to take the pin out.
You'll find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.
Not her.
So, you guys really slide down a pole?
-Absolutely.
-That's so cool.
How do you get back up?
Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.
So, would you guys.
Would you like to, sometime, maybe.
Go for a drink sometime?
Sure, sounds good.
We get off at midnight.
We'll pick you up then.
Okay.
Great!
So will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
-We'll see you later.
-Bye!
See you later!
Oh, my God!
See?
There you go.
The cleansing worked.
You're right.
They're nice guys!
They're firemen guys!
-Tell them you're married?
-No.
My girlfriend doesn't even know.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Coffee.
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.
Thank you.
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser?
That's why.
Sorry.
The One With The Stoned Guy Chandler?
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.
That is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop by his office today.
If it's about those prank memos, I wasn't involved.
Nothing at all.
Really.
And frankly, those shenanigans have no place in an office environment.
Hey, you guys!
Chandler's coming and he has incredible news.
So when he gets here, let's all act, like, you know Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.
What's going on?
So it's a typical day at work and Big Al tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
-That is great!
-Congratulations!
So I quit.
Why?
Why?
This was a temp job.
Chandler, you've been there for five years.
I know, but if I took it, I'd be admitting that this is what I do.
Does that mean we have to start buying our own toilet paper?
That was Joey Tribbiani with the big picture.
Dan?
Was it more money?
Doesn't matter.
I just don't want to be a guy who sits in his office worrying about the WENUS.
The "WENUS"?
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.
Oh, that WENUS.
What will you do?
I don't know.
But I won't figure it out working there.
I have something you can do!
I have this new massage client, Steve.
Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
-Hi, there.
-Hi.
I know.
You're a chef and I thought of you first.
But Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.
I just don't have a lot of chef-ing experience.
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
What is he looking for?
He wants to do something eclectic.
He's looking for someone who can create the entire menu.
So, what do you think?
Thanks.
I just don't see myself in a big, white hat.
Oh, Monica!
Guess what?
a perfect run-up and there he goes, a perfect.
Watch stuff like this and you realize why evolution is just a theory.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going?
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!
-I added the "a-go-go".
-Career counselor?
You guys all know what you want to do.
I don't.
You guys in the living room all know what you want to do.
You have goals.
You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!
The lesser-known "I Don't Have a Dream" speech.
I love my life!
I love my life!
"Brian's Song"!
-The meeting went great?
-So great!
He showed me where the restaurant's gonna be.
It's not too big or too small.
It's just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears?
I'm cooking for him Monday, kind of an audition.
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great.
You can make yummy noises.
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know.
It's gotta be great.
I know what you can make!
I know!
You should make that thing with the stuff.
You know that thing with the stuff?
Okay, I don't know.
Anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's?
If you finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Anyone know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
-Who are you going out with?
-ls this the bug lady?
"I love you, Ross".
Her name is Celia and she's insect curator at the museum.
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner then bring her back to my place and introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe.
Well, I don't know.
I'm hoping.
That monkey is a chick magnet.
She'll take one look at his cute, little face and it'll seal the deal.
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!
Soothing tones.
-Here, Marcel.
-I can't stand this.
-He's got his claws on my -Yeah, all right.
Okay, try this salmon mousse.
Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
-It's creamier.
-Yeah?
Well, is that better?
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.
God, what happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn?
"You're suited for data processing for a large multinational corporation".
That's so great!
You already know how to do that.
Can you believe it?
Don't I seem like I should be doing something cool?
I just always pictured myself doing something.
Something!
Chandler, I know, I know.
Hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt.
Maybe this will cheer you up.
I had a grape about five hours ago, so I better split this with you.
It's supposed to be small.
It's a pre-appetizer.
The French call it an amuse-bouche.
Well, it is amusing.
Hi, Wendy.
Yeah, 8:00.
What did we say, $10 an hour?
Okay, great.
All right, I'll see you then.
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is helping me.
Waitressing?
Of course I thought of you.
But.
-But.
-But, but.
But it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know?
Wendy's more of a professional waitress.
And I'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics.
I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.
Took home a bronze.
Amuse-bouche?
Talk to me.
A weird thing happened on the train this morning Talk dirty.
-Here?
-Come on.
Come on.
Say something hot.
What?
What?
Vulva.
Vulva?
I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.
But it wasn't a total loss.
We ended up cuddling.
You cuddled?
How many times?
Shut up.
It was nice.
I don't think I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.
Or what other people might be doing to each other.
I'll tell you what.
Try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Why not?
Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
I'm in my apartment.
-Yeah, what else?
-You're not there.
-We're not having this conversation.
-All right, I'll start.
Ready?
Oh, Ross you get me so hot.
I want your lips on me now.
-Now you say something.
-I really don't think so.
You like this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?
If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you wanna caress my butt!
Okay, turn around.
I don't want you staring at me.
All right, I'm not looking.
Go ahead.
Okay.
I want Okay, I want to feel your hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.
I want to take my tongue and Say it.
Say it!
run it all over your body until you're trembling with With?
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
-The trembling thing was nice.
-Shut up!
That guy from your old job called again.
-Again?
-And again and again and again.
And again.
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?
Yeah, I miss you too.
It's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home.
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.
I need more than a job.
I need something I really care ab That's on top of the year-end bonus?
Your dream!
Look, Al, I'm not playing hardball here, okay?
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!
Stop saying numbers!
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!
I'll see you Monday!
Wow!
It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.
This is a cube!
Look at this.
You have a window!
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautiful view of Look!
That guy's peeing!
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.
Okay, sit down here.
This is great.
-You ready?
-Yeah.
Helen, could you come in here?
Thank you, Helen.
That'll be all.
Last time I do that.
I promise.
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know.
She has no personality.
Wendy, don't do this to me.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you promised.
-Who was that?
-Wendy bailed.
I have no waitress.
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.
Ten dollars an hour!
Twelve dollars an hour!
I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
When you ran out on your wedding, I was there.
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing.
Twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Hello.
Welcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.
Hello, greeter girl.
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.
Everything smells so delicious.
I can't remember ever smelling such a delicious combination of Okay, smells.
-It's a lovely apartment.
-Thank you.
Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite, but all right.
-What's up?
-ln the cab on the way over Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone.
Weed, hemp, ganja I'm with you, Cheech.
-Do you think he's gonna be cool?
-ls it dry in here?
Let me get you some wine.
I think we're ready for our first course too.
These are rock shrimp ravioli in a cilantro ponzu sauce with just a touch of minced ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh!
I'm so glad you liked them.
Like them?
I could eat 100 of them!
That's all there is of these but in a few minutes, we'll serve some tartlets.
"Tartlets"?
"Tartlets".
"Tartlets".
Word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Cool!
Taco shells!
They're like a little corn envelope, you know?
-You don't wanna spoil your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!
You know, if you just wait another 6 1 /2 minutes Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.
Sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here?
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.
-Give them to me.
-We'll share.
-No.
Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.
It's not worth it!
Bears overboard!
They're drowning!
Don't just stand there.
Call 9-1 -1.
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!
Help!
Help, I'm drowning!
-That's it!
Dinner is over!
-What!
Why?
Why?
What if I came into your office and I started?
I can't think of an example.
I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes for a tartlet?
So I told him, "I'm sorry.
That's how I feel".
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.
Then I said, "Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet".
And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room.
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tool.
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.
I just thought that this was it.
-Don't worry.
You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.
Am I gonna get paid for the full three hours?
Just a question.
We'll talk about it later.
So, how did it go with Celia?
-I was unbelievable.
-All right, Ross!
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.
It was the most elaborate filth ever heard.
I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif.
At one point, there were villagers.
And?
By the time we finished all the dirty talk it was late and we were exhausted -You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.
Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie?
-Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
-Where the hell is he?
I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Let me tell you something.
You will care about it because I care about it.
Got it?
Good!
How's this?
Sorry.
How about over here?
That means it's working.
-Does this hurt?
-No.
How about this?
There you go!
I'm gonna throw up!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
This is unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.
If this was a cartoon, you'd look like a ham about now.
There's the waitress.
Excuse me!
- Hello, miss?
- It's Phoebe!
Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?
I was over there then you said, "Excuse me, miss".
So now I'm here.
How come you're working here?
Because it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Can we start over?
Okay, great.
I'm gonna be over here.
The One With the Two Parts - Part I I don't know if he's testing me or just acting out but my monkey is out of control!
He keeps erasing the messages on my machine.
Supposedly by accident.
Yeah, I've done that.
And three days in a row, he got to the newspaper before I did and peed all over the crossword!
I've never done that.
And then last night, I don't know what he did, but there were capers everywhere.
Allright now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.
I'm saying I see a difference.
They're twins.
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe.
Ursula's hot.
You know that thing when we talk about things?
Let's not do that anymore.
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today?
Oh, fun!
- Liam Neeson.
- No.
Morley Safer.
The woman who cuts my hair!
This could be a really long game.
Your sister, Ursula.
Oh, really?
She works at that place Riff's.
Yeah, I know.
You do?
She said you guys haven't talked in years.
So is she fat?
Not from where I was standing.
Where were you standing?
Pheebs, so you guys just don't get along?
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know?
Everyone always thought of her as the pretty one.
She was the first to walk even though I did it later that same day.
To my parents, by then it was, "Yeah, what else is new"?
I'm sorry.
I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.
And I've got earth science, but I'll catch you in gym?
Is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Susan will be there too.
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.
Isn't that gonna be weird?
It might have been at first but now I'm comfortable with the situation.
Ross, that's my jacket.
I know.
We're the Rostens.
I'm J.C. And he's Michael.
And we're having a boy and a girl.
Good for you!
Alrighty, next?
I'm Ross Geller.
And that's my boy in there.
And this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch.
Susan is Carol's Who's next?
Sorry I didn't get it, Susan is?
- Susan is Carol's friend.
- Life partner.
Like buddies.
Like lovers.
You know how close women can get.
- Susan and I live together.
- I was married to her.
- Carol, not me.
- It's a little complicated.
- But we're fine.
- Absolutely.
So, twins!
That's like two birds.
- To you too, Helen!
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Okay, send her in.
- Come on in.
- You wanted to see me?
I was just going over your data.
You've been postdating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?
It throws my WENUS out of whack.
Excuse me?
WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
Right.
Gotcha, gotcha.
Won't happen again.
I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your WENUS.
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that she's really, really cute.
It doesn't matter.
You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
God, even I know that, and I'm pretty much unemployable.
Ross.
Your little creature's got the remote again.
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.
Marcel!
Marcel, you give Rossy the remote right now!
You give Rossy the remote - Great.
- Relax.
I'll fix it.
Oh, cool.
Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.
How did he do this?
Is leaving the Christmas lights up your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot!
Someone was supposed to write: "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the refrigera How long has that been there?
Where you been?
I went to Riff's.
I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.
She brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
She is so hot!
Okay, before you do anything Joey-like you might want to run it by Pheebs?
Would it be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why?
Why would you want to do that?
Why?
So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know whatever.
And I mean, it's true, we were one egg once.
But, you know, we've grown apart, so I don't know.
Why not?
Cool.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Do you wanna watch "Laverne y Shirley"?
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.
You can go.
I'll get the information.
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.
Oh, good.
This will be fun.
We're gonna start with some basic third-stage breathing exercises.
Mommies, get on your back.
And, coaches, you should be supporting Mommy's head.
- What?
- What?
I'm supposed to be the mommy?
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
I have to miss out on the coaching training because I'm a woman?
So what do you propose to do?
- I'll flip you for it.
- Flip me for it?
Heads, heads, heads!
On your back, Mom!
All right, Mommies, take a nice, deep, cleansing breath.
Good.
Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Mr. Dee!
How's it going, sir?
It's been better.
The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
It's pretty ugly.
We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the '70s.
What's it mean?
We'll be laying off people.
I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.
Not you.
Relax.
Ever have to fire anyone?
No, but that's not a problem sir, that's why my name's on the door.
By the way, do you know when I'm getting my name on the door?
I don't know.
I put it in "the thing".
So who's it gonna be?
Nina Nina.
Nina?
Ninaaaa.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Listen, the reason that I called you in here today was Please don't hate me.
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
What I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?
Bath salts would be nice!
Good.
What is this place?
You're cold, I have to pee, and there's coffee.
How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
What's she doing here?
This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
- Think she got fired at Riff's?
- No, we were there last night.
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go?
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?
It looks like her.
Excuse me?
Hi, it's us!
Right.
And it's me!
So you're here too?
As much as you are.
Your turn.
We know what we want.
That's good.
- Two caffe lattes.
- And some biscotti cookies.
Good choice.
It's definitely her.
I can't believe you.
You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job?
You still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations!
I think you found the world's thinnest argument.
Trying to find the right moment.
That shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating.
"Sweetheart, you're fired.
But how about a quickie before I go to work"?
Once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.
I'll get it.
Hi, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
We're just sitting around talking quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling.
My cats can't sleep.
You don't even have cats.
I could have cats.
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?
Try this on to make sure it fits.
My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really No no no, it's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Sure.
Yeah.
Okay, it fits.
Are you seeing her again?
Yep, Ice Capades.
This is serious.
I've never known you to pay money for any kind of "capade".
I don't know.
I like her.
She's different.
There's something about her That you like.
We get it.
You like her.
Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was okay.
Well, maybe now it's not okay.
Well, maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Knit, good woman.
Knit!
Knit!
And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
Mr. Douglas.
Cool tie.
She's still here.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
Didn't I memo you?
After I let her go, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.
And he informed me that she took the news rather badly.
In fact, he mentioned the word "frenzy".
She seems so Oh, no, no.
Nina?
She's In fact, if you asked her now she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.
That's unbelievable.
And yet believable.
So I decided not to fire her again until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.
I see.
You never really know what's going on inside a person's head.
Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.
For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.
Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
It's impossible.
It's just impossible.
What is, honey?
What that woman did.
I am not doing that!
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.
- It'll just stay in.
- Carol, honey.
- Everything will be all right.
- What do you know?
No one's saying to you, "Hi, is that your nostril?
Mind if we push this pot roast through it"?
!
Carol, sweetie.
Cleansing breath.
I know it's frightening.
But big picture: The birth part is just one day and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.
I mean, that's what this is all about, right?
Ross?
Ross.
I'm gonna be a father.
- This is just occurring to you?
- I knew I was having a baby.
I just never realized the baby was having me.
You're gonna be great.
How could you say that?
I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.
How am I gonna raise a kid?
You know, some scientists are now saying that monkeys and babies are actually different.
You might wonna look into it - Where are you going?
- Out.
With?
Yes!
Alright, can I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know, like, you know?
You know?
Yet?
Well, not that it's any of your business, but no, we haven't.
Okay?
You meant sex, right?
- Do you have a sec?
- Sure, Nina.
What's up?
I don't know, for the past couple of days, people have been avoiding me and giving me strange looks.
Oh, well, maybe that's because they're jealous of us.
Maybe.
But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Well, maybe that's because you're getting a big raise!
- I am?
- Sure.
Why not?
Oh, my God!
You're amazing!
Oh, you don't know.
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
You still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel?
Helen drinks.
Will you marry me?
- After the proposal, I kind of unreveled.
Right, because you were really in control up untill then.
- Yeah, well, I ended up telling her everything.
- Oh, how'd she take it?
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.
Little tip.
If you're ever in a similar situation never, ever leave your hand on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?
Because I can't watch.
They're gone.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
It's just this whole stupid Ursula thing.
Okay Pheebs, can I ask?
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not saying she's evil or anything.
She's just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff.
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos so she threw it under the bus.
And then when I was twelve and she broke my colar bone.
Alright, she didn't mean to do it.
But I think it still counts.
And then there's Randy Brown who was like Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend?
Well, but that's what he was for me.
And she, you know, kind of stole him away and then broke his heart.
And then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.
He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.
I mean, I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos or anything, but - You won't lose him.
- You gotta talk to Joey.
Yeah, okay.
He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt He's falling in love with her.
They've been going out a week.
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.
May we help you?
What are you doing?
It's freezing!
Would you come inside?
No, no, no.
You wanted me to take them down so I'm taking them down, okay?
Rachel!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Mr. Heckles?
Mr. Heckles, could you help me, please?
This is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
My friend was taking down our Christmas lights and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her ankle.
My God, you still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Here you go.
All right.
Name address Okay, are you currently on any medication?
No.
Oh, wait wait yes!
Blistex.
Ah, NO!
In case of emergency, call?
You.
Really?
Oh, that is so sweet!
Oh, gosh.
I love you.
Okay, insurance?
Yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!
You don't have insurance?
Why?
How much is this gonna cost?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars!
- What'll we do?
- There's not much we can do.
Unless I use yours.
Now wait a second.
Who did I just put as my "in case of emergency" person?
That's insurance fraud.
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.
- Okay, come here.
I hate this.
- Thank you.
I love you.
I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.
Why?
I am really an idiot!
I was filling out my friend's form and instead of putting her information I put mine.
You are an idiot.
Yep, that's me.
I am that stupid.
I had a dream that I was playing football with my kid.
That's nice.
No, no.
With him.
I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
I've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay team's coming right at me!
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Right, but it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us.
And so, I I just heave it downfield!
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby!
He should take the sack?
Anyway suddenly I'm downfield.
And I realize that I'm the one who's suppose to catch him, right?
Only I know I'm not gonna get there in time.
So I am running and I'm running and that is when I woke up.
See, I am so not ready to be a father.
Hey, you're gonna be fine.
You're one of the most caring, responsible men in North America.
You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, Ross.
You and the baby just need better blocking.
Have you ever been to the Rainbow Room?
Is it expensive?
Only if you order stuff.
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.
- What about Phoebe's birthday?
- When's that?
Tonight.
Man, what are the odds of that happening?
You take your time.
There it is!
So, what are you gonna do?
What can I do?
I don't want to screw it up with Ursula.
And your friend, Phoebe?
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?
If you tried that on my birthday you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.
An added pinch of saffron makes all the difference.
Monica?
Yes?
Yes, she is.
This is my friend, Rachel.
Hi Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.
I'm Okay here.
actually, that's alright.
I don't mind at all, now you can take your break.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
I meant, god, young, young.
I meant young.
Young to be a doctor.
- Good, Rach.
- Thank you.
So he said it was a sprain, and that was it.
You left out the stupid part.
It's not stupid.
The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.
I think it's totally insane.
They work for the hospital.
It's like returning to the scene of the crime.
- I say we blow off the dates.
- What?
Monica, they are cute.
They are doctors.
Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.
All right, what have we learned so far?
Oh, God.
Surprise!
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!
- Was that the cake?
- Yeah.
I got a lemon schmush.
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.
I hope it's okay.
"Happy Birthday, Peehee".
Maybe we can make a "B" out of a rose.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
- What's going on?
- We just Surprise!
This is so great!
This was not at all scary.
Oh look, "happy birthday Peehee".
What a strange new nickname.
I like it!
Oh my god!
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Betty!
Betty, hi!
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh!
This is so great.
Everybody I love is in the same room.
Where's Joey?
Did you see Betty?
I'll tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business.
Five years ago, if somebody'd said, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune" I'd have said, "Get out of my office"!
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying if someone had come to me with the idea I'm talking about the whole baby thing.
Did you ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
We just had kids back then.
We didn't think about it.
What else could the sun dry?
I wonder.
Right, look.
Your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?
No, no.
I was just wondering.
Cause there's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg.
How about we do that?
Thanks, Dad, really.
You know, I just, I just I just needed to know when did you start to feel like a father?
Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.
We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep and they brought you in and gave you to me.
You were this ugly little red thing!
And all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist and you squeezed it so tight.
And that's when I knew.
So you don't want to go to Williamsburg?
We can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
Okay, coming.
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.
Here, we brought wine.
Look at this.
It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
- How could we resist?
- Oh, that's great, look at that!
- So, Monica, how's the ankle?
- It's Why don't you tell them?
After all, it is your ankle.
You know, what?
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.
listen, why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses.
Stat!
Okay, listen, I'm thinking why don't we just tell them who we really are?
- I mean it'll be fine.
I really think it will be fine.
- It will not be fine.
We'll get in trouble.
Mnica, would you stop being such a wuss!
A wuss?
Excuse me for living in the real world.
- So?
- So they still seem normal.
That's because they are.
Okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital it turns into Would you relax?
Take a look around.
There are no pagan altars.
No piles of bones in the corners.
They're fine.
Go like this: I said we are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!
- I am not a baby.
- Be serious.
- You get uptight - You act like a princess.
You know what?
You know what?
Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Excuse me.
Here we go.
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?
Thanks.
I've been here about six years.
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
See, I was supposed to get married but I left the guy at the altar.
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me!
Why don't you try the hummus?
So, Monica, what do you do?
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
Yeah, it is.
Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Well, this hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, God!
I am so spoiled!
That's it.
I shoplift.
That was years ago and you had no idea that lipstick was in your pocket.
Did I tell you that I think I'm so much cuter than I am?
And have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment.
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad.
No, no.
It's me.
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
But there's something There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Excuse me.
Remember back in freshman year?
Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy Daddy, daddy why?
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
His father tried to put you out of business!
You are dead!
Hey, Rachel, are these your condoms?
Oh, no.
No, that was just Monica.
She's drunk again.
Ah, Pheebs, I don't think scrunchy is a word.
Why not?
If crunchy is a word, why isn't scrunchy?
Well, okay, then I'm using that same argument for fligament.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Good.
Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
Okay, daddy, that's the other line.
Okay, no.
Not even in my bedroom.
Okay, okay.
Bye-bye.
Hello?
Hold on a second and let me just check and see if she's here.
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.
Oh, God, what do we do?
Just find out what they want.
Okay.
No, you do it.
Hello.
This is Monica.
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
- You're right, this wasn't worth it.
- Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.
gudje?
- Nautical term.
- Cheating man.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey Hi.
- She still didn't call?
- No.
Trouble?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Oh, no.
Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
What is that?
Tushy!
- Well, did you try calling her?
- I've been trying for two days.
When I called the restaurant, they said she was busy.
I can't believe she's blowing me off!
Excuse me, we had the two chef salads.
No, we havn't had hem yet.
We're still hoping to have them.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Oh.
You got a minute?
Yeah, I'm just working.
I got you a birthday present.
Wow, you remembered!
It's a Judy Jetson thermos.
Right, ike the kind you Right.
Oh, I got something for you too.
How'd you know I was coming?
Yeah, twin thing.
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you did this!
So what's the deal with you and Joey?
Oh, right.
He is so great.
But that's over.
- Does he know?
- Who?
Joey.
You know, he's really nutsy about you.
He is?
Why?
You got me.
Excuse me doesn't this come with a side salad?
So are you gonna call him?
- You think he likes me?
- No.
Joey.
No, no.
He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.
Do you want some chicken?
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?
You have not changed.
Yeah, you too.
Excuse me.
My side salad?
The service in here is horrible.
Hi!
Remember us?
You just called about needing a signature on the admissions form?
Well, it turns out we need a whole new one.
Because, you see I put the wrong name again.
- Because - You're that stupid!
I am.
I'm that stupid!
And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.
Mon, I'm sorry about last night what I said.
I don't think you're anything like your mother.
Oh, that's alright.
And I don't think you're selfish running out on Berry.
Oh, and I'm sorry that I said you were a cow in high school.
That's okay.
I was a cow.
Okay, worst case scenario: Say you never feel like a father.
Say your son never feels connected to you as one.
Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?
You know, you'd think I would.
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
Whose turn is it?
Yours.
I got No, you got zero points for "idney".
I had a "K".
Where's my "K"?
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a "K"!
You have to get that animal out of here!
You don't understand, the animal hospital is way across town.
He's choking!
I don't know what else to do!
- What's going on?
- Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people!
Lady, he is people!
He has a name, okay?
He watches "Jeopardy"!
he touches himself when nobody's watching.
Please have a heart.
- I'll take a look at him.
- Thank you.
- Michael!
- Rachel.
- What?
- Monica.
Urs!
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.
Listen Oh, no no no, don't say "listen".
I know that "listen".
I've said that "listen".
I'm sorry.
I don't get it.
What happened?
What about what you said under the bridge?
Forget about what I said under the bridge.
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't.
But I was drunk on you.
But it's not gonna work.
Why?
Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
No, I couldn't do that.
Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
So you know, it's either her or me.
Then I'm sorry.
You're gonna be really hard to get over.
I know.
I don't know whether it's just because we're breaking up or what but you've never looked so beautiful.
Really?
Pheebs?
He looks so tiny.
- We just got the message.
- Is he okay?
The doctor got the "K" out.
He also found an "M" and an "O".
We think he was trying to spell out "monkey".
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.
So you feel like a dad yet?
No.
Why?
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.
That's very "dad".
He's waking up.
Hey, fella.
How you doing?

Okay, it fits.
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.
How did he do this?
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?
- You don't know my sister.
- Talk to Joey.
- He's falling in love with her.
- You won't lose him.
They haven't even slept together yet.

I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
- What are we gonna do?
- There's not much we can do.
Uh, unless I use yours.
No, no, no, no, no.
Well, now, wait a second.
Who did I just put as my "in case of emergency" person?
That's insurance fraud.
Well, all right, then.
Forget it.
Might as well just go home.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, come here.
I hate this.
- Thank you.
I love you.
Hi, heh.

There it is.
So, what are you gonna do?
What can I do?
I don't want to screw it up with Ursula.

If she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?
Man, if you tried that on my birthday you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.

Okay, uh - Monica?
- Yes?
Yes, she is.
- Hi.
This is my friend Rachel.
- Hi.
Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?

God, young, young.
I meant young, heh.
Young to be a doctor.
- Oh, good, Rach.
- Thank you.
Right.

- What?
Monica, they are cute.
They are doctors.
Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.
All right, what have we learned so far?
Surprise!
What the hell are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me.
- Was that the cake?
- Yeah.
I got a lemon shmush.
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.
I hope it's okay.
"Happy Birthday, Peehee".
Maybe we can make a B out of one of those roses.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
- Hey, what's going on?
Oh, we just  Surprise!
Oh, oh, oh!
This is so great.
Oh, my God.
This was not at all scary.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Betty.
Betty, hi.
You found Betty.
Oh, my gosh.
This is so great.
Everybody I love is in the same room.
Where's Joey?
Did you see Betty?
I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business.
Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune" I'd have said, "Get out of my office".

I'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing.
Did you, uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No.
Your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?
No, no, Dad.
I was just wondering.
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg.
How about we do that?
Thanks, Dad.
Really, heh.
You know, I just, I just I just needed to know, um when did you start to feel like a father?
Oh.
Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.
We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep and they brought you in and gave you to me.
You were this ugly little red thing.
And all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist and you squeezed it so tight.
And that's when I knew.
So you don't want to go to Williamsburg?
We can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Okay, coming.
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, here, we brought wine.
Look at this.
It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
- So how could we resist?
- Oh, that's great.
- So, Monica, how's the ankle?
- It's, uh  Why don't you tell them?
After all, it is your ankle.
You know, it's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.
Listen, why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Um - Stat.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are?
- I mean, I think it'll be fine.
- It will not.
We'll get in trouble.
Monica, would you stop being such a wuss?
A wuss?
Excuse me for living in the real world.
- So?
- So they still seem normal.
That's because they are.
You have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital Would you relax?
Take a look around.
There are no pagan altars.
No piles of bones in the corners.
They're fine.
Go like this: I said we are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby.
- I am not a baby.
- Be serious.
- You get uptight - You act like a princess.
- You know what?
You know what?
- What?
What?
Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Excuse me.
Hello, here we go.
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?
Thanks.
I've been here about six years.
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
See, I was supposed to get married but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but, heh hey, that's me.
- Why don't you try the hummus?
Ahem.
So, Monica, what do you do?
Uh, I am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yeah, it is.
Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Well, this hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, God.
I am so spoiled.
That's it.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that.
Monica and Rachel's apartment.
Uh Uh, yeah, just one second.
Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad.
No, no.
It's me.
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
Um But there's something, um There's something that I've been meaning to tell you.
Excuse me.
Remember back in freshman year?
Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy Daddy Daddy, why?
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
His father tried to put you out of business.
You are dead.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Good.
Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
Hello?
Uh, ueah Uh Okay, uh, hold on a second and let me just check and see if she's here.
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.
Oh, God, what do we do?
I don't know.
Just find out what they want.
Okay.
No, you do it.
Hello.
This is Monica.
Yeah?
Oh.
Okay.
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
- Okay, you're right, this wasn't worth it.
- Thank you.
- Okay, let me just change.
- Yes.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Trouble?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Oh, no.
Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
- Did you try calling her?
- I've been trying for two days.
When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk.
I can't believe she's blowing me off.
Hey.
Oh.
Um, you got a minute?
Um, yeah, I'm just working.
- So - Uh-huh?
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Oh, wow, you remembered.
Oh.
It's a Judy Jetson Thermos.
Right.
Like the kind you Right.
Oh, I got something for you too.
How'd you know I was coming?
Um, yeah, um, "twin" thing.
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you did this.
So, what's the deal with, um, you and Joey?
Oh, right.
He is so great.
But that's over.
- Does he know?
- Who?
Joey.
You know, um, ahem, he's really nutsy about you.
He is?
Why?
- You got me.
- Right.
Excuse me doesn't this come with a side salad?
So, um, are you gonna call him?
- What, you think he likes me?
- No.
Joey.
Oh.
No, no.
He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.
Do you want some chicken?
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?
You have not changed.
Yeah, you too.
- Hi.
Remember us?
- Mm-hm.
Um, yeah, you just called about needing a signature on the admissions form?
Well, it turns out we need a whole new one.
Because, um, you see I put the wrong name again.
- Because, um - You're that stupid.
I am.
I'm that stupid.
Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
You know, your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.
Okay, worst case scenario: - Say you never feel like a father.
- Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you as one.
Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?
You know, you'd think I would.
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
Okay, whose turn is it?
Yours.
I just got 43 points for "kidney".
No, you got zero points for "idney".
I had a K. Where's my K?
You've got to help me.
My monkey swallowed a K. Get that animal out of here.
The animal hospital is way across town.
He's choking.
I don't know what to do.
- What's going on?
- Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people.
Lady, he is people.
He has a name, okay?
He watches Jeopardy he touches himself when nobody's watching.
Please, have a heart.
- I'll take a look at him.
- Oh, thank you.
- Michael.
- Rachel.
- What?
- Monica.
- Oh.
- Hi.
Hey.
Urs.
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.
Listen, um Don't say "listen".
I know that "listen".
I've said that "listen".
I'm sorry.
I don't get it.
What happened?
What about everything you said under the bridge?
Yeah, um, ahem You know, just forget about what I said under the bridge.
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't.
But I was drunk on you.
- Oh, Urs.
- But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Why?
Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
No.
No, I couldn't do that.
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
So you know, it's either her or me.
Then, uh Then I'm sorry.
You know you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I know.
I don't know whether it's just because we're breaking up or what but you have never looked so beautiful.
Really?
- Pheebs?
- Yeah.
He looks so tiny.
- We just got the message.
- Is he all right?
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.
He also found an M and an O. We think he was trying to spell out "monkey".
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.
So you feel like a dad yet?
No.
Why?
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.
That is very dad.
Oh, look, he's waking up.
Hey, fella.
How you doing?
Ooh.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
We're running low on resumes.
You want a job with Popular Mechanics?
If you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones.
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me".
-Paper cut!
Paper cut!
-Here.
Grapefruit juice!
Grapefruit juice!
Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah.
Why?
Nothing.
I'm sure they'll be impressed with your "compuper" skills.
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
The One With the Poker They call this a love seat but I'm not feeling anything special towards you.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.
Hi, ladies.
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.
-Really?
Sure, we have scones left!
Read them.
"Dear Miss Greene: Thank you for your inquiry.
However" -We have apple cinnamon -"Dear Ms. Greene".
Yeah, yeah!
No.
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!
Give me that.
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?
-I don't know.
-ls this about her "The Flintstones could have really happened" thing?
It's not just that.
I want someone who does something for me who gets my heart pounding.
Who makes me.
Little playthings with yarn?
What?
Could you want her more?
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!
!
.
Look, I'm totally over her.
-Hi!
-Coffee?
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.
-What?
-Joey cried last night.
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep"!
And then he did.
Now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No.
Women can play.
Then, what is it?
Some kind of, like, some kind of, you know All right, what is it?
There are just no women in our game.
We just don't know any women who know how to play poker.
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.
Do you know how to play?
No.
-But you could teach us.
-No.
Okay, so now we draw cards.
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.
-No, you can't -I have the 10 of spades!
Here.
Thanks!
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them.
I'm going for fours.
Oh, you're You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you?
Thanks, man.
Here we go.
We've got salmon roulettes and crudites.
What are you doing?
In poker, there's no food with more than one syllable.
It's got to be like chips or dip or pretz I hope you'll let it slide just this once.
I was all out of "pretz".
Now the dealer We got it.
Let's play for real.
High stakes.
Big bucks!
You sure?
Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy.
But I'm ready.
So just deal.
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey.
Three.
Eight.
Eight.
Three.
All right, very good.
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Joey had two fives showing, so for you to raise was Yes?
Downright gutsy.
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.
And what is bluffing?
Is it not another word for lying?
Sorry to break up this party, but I've got to go fax resumes before work.
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.
See, King George is giving us the land.
-The game, Rachel.
You owe us money.
-Right.
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.
Hell, no.
We'll pay!
Monica, I had another answer all ready.
And you know what?
We want a rematch.
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.
So you get your ya-yas by taking money from your friends.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.
You have to put them together yourself, but they cost less.
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.
For me to win, others have to lose.
If you're gonna play, don't expect me to be nice.
Because once those cards are dealt.
Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
All right, let's eat.
Did you get that from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy".
You're way off.
No, I don't think so, because I think you love her!
No.
I might have had feelings for her at one time.
Not anymore.
I just Marcel!
Where are you going with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.
If you press that button, you are in very big trouble.
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.
What?
"Hello, kettle?
This is Monica.
You're black"!
Please!
I'm not as bad as Ross.
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?
That wasn't an incident.
I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding!
Where?
Saks Fifth Avenue.
Oh, Rachel!
It's like the mother ship is calling you home.
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.
I would be shopping!
For a living!
That's Aunt lris.
She's been playing poker since she was 5.
You've got to listen to every word she says.
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.
-He may be now.
I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.
Let me tell you something.
Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap!
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it.
Okay?
We'll start with five-card draw.
Then we'll go into the studs and the hold 'ems.
I talked to Cousin Nathan.
Don't touch the cards when somebody is dealing.
How is Nathan?
Now he thinks he's a man in a woman's body.
Don't you mean a woman in a man's body?
It should be so simple.
Ross, could we please listen to anything else?
All right.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Hi.
Guys, guess what?
The fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending Trident?
No, the interview!
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.
And I went to camp with her cousin.
-The job is perfect!
I can do this.
-That's great!
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.
Let's play poker!
Listen, we talked about it and if you don't wanna play, it's okay.
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?
Very funny.
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.
So Pheebs owes $7.
50.
Monica owes $10.00.
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed Mary.
We gotta play that other way.
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.
-What?
-I cursed it!
Now bad things will happen to the spender.
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
This way, I can split them up with a movie.
So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.
Could you be any smugger?
Let's see.
Rach, I'm opening up a new art gallery and I could sure use the portraits of Lincoln and Hamilton.
It's so typical.
"I'm a man!
I have a penis!
I have to win money to exert my power over women"!
This isn't over.
We'll play you again.
We'll win.
You'll lose.
You'll beg.
We'll laugh.
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!
Kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?
Like 30 bucks.
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?
Yes!
Wanna give us your money now?
We can skip the formality of really playing.
No, that's fine.
We'll see who has the last laugh, monkey boy.
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?
You guys, look!
The one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.
Right.
Serious poker.
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.
Want to go to the bathroom or play poker?
Go to the bathroom.
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00.
Eat then.
That's fine.
I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over.
All right.
Cincinnati.
No blinds.
Everybody, ante.
Yes!
Or no.
-All right!
Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!
Coincidence?
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.
-I'm in.
-Me too.
Me too.
What do you got?
You better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush.
Well, well, well!
Hop back in, bucko, because I got four sixes!
I got four sixes!
I won!
I actually won!
Oh, my God!
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.
Look!
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.
Well, I have got your money And you'll never see it And your fly's still open I made you look -I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.
Monica, in or out?
I hate this game!
Joey, your bet.
I fold like a hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.
I'm out.
-Ross?
-I'm very in.
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.
Me too.
Rachel?
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?
No, not this time.
What did you have?
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.
-No.
-Show them!
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you?
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!
Plus, that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.
Hello.
Rachel Greene.
Excuse me.
It's about the job!
Barbara, hi!
How are you?
No, I understand.
Come on.
No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.
Yeah.
But if anything else opens up, please Hello?
Sorry, Rach.
There's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Okay.
Where were we?
Five-card draw.
Jacks are better.
Nothing wild.
Everybody, ante.
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.
-All right.
Check.
-Check.
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.
I'm in.
I see your 50 cents and I raise you $5.
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.
I just lost a job, I'd like to raise it $5.
Does anyone have a problem with that?
-Not at all.
-No.
Loser?
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?
I thought that, "Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy".
Were you just full of it?
I'm in.
-How many do you want?
-One.
Dealer takes two.
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.
Okay.
I see your $2 and I raise you 20.
I see your $20 raise you $25.
I see your $25 and Monica, get my purse.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Okay, then get me your purse.
-Here you go.
Good luck!
-Thank you.
I saw your $25 and I raise you seven.
teen!
Joey, I'm a little shy.
That's okay, Ross.
You can ask me.
-What do you need?
-1 5.
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
I am calling your 1 7.
What do you got?
Full house.
You got me.
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!
When you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards.
But look how happy she is.
-Airmail.
-Airplane.
Airport.
Airport '75!
Airport '77!
Airport '79!
Time's up!
Bye Bye Birdie!
That's a bird?
That's a bird!
Okay, it's my turn.
Go!
Bean!
Bean!
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!
That you get?
That you get?
!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Okay, I checked.
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick Chamomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry and Wait, there's one more.
Lemon Soother!
You're not the guy that asked for tea, are you?
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.
Thank you.
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.
Oh, good.
Because where else would we get any?
Oh, right.
-Oh, great.
-What is it?
Country club newsletter.
My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration.
Oh, my God!
It's Barry and Mindy!
Barry, who you almost And Mindy, your maid of Let me see.
That's Mindy?
She is pretty!
Lucky to have had a friend like you.
Now it's quiet time.
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on.
Good boy.
Give me the rice.
Thank you.
Good boy.
He's mastered the difference between "bring me the" and "pee in the".
"Bring me the" and Rach?
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is so stupid!
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
I should be happy for them.
I am.
I'm happy for them.
-Really?
-No.
I guess it would be different if I were with somebody.
Whoa, what.
What happened to "Forget relationships!
I'm done with men"!
The whole penis embargo?
I don't know.
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.
With Barry it was safe and easy, but there was no heat.
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual -Right.
I got it.
I was there.
Do you think you can have both?
Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I really do.
In fact, it's funny.
Often, someone you wouldn't think could curl your toes might just be the one who gets interrupted.
How was the movie?
-Wonderful!
-So good!
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with guns and bombs and buses going really fast!
I don't need violence in a movie as long as there's a little nudity.
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.
I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Hugh!
Hugh Grant!
All right, I've got to go.
Come on, Marcel.
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?
They're still just friends, right?
And I will see you tomorrow.
You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Please, Aunt Monica, please?
Unclench.
You're not even gonna be here.
-I can't believe we're discussing this.
-I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.
If it was gonna happen, wouldn't it have happened already?
She said she wants a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She said that?
I added the exactly like me" part.
But she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.
"Tonight" tonight?
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.
She spent all day taking care of my monkey.
I can't remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work, I'd pick up some wine go over there and try to woo her.
Know what you should do?
Take her back to the 1 890s when that phrase was last used.
If you keep this up, you'll be finished by the weekend.
The one in the feathered boa is Dr. Francis.
Now, she used to be a man.
Look, there's Raven.
We hate her.
We're glad she's dying.
And then What?
Marcel!
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
Oh, Marcel!
Bad monkey!
Oh, God!
Sorry, Barry.
A little engagement gift.
I'm sure you didn't register for that.
Who died?
Who died?
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel?
Because Marcel?
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!
We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe.
Wait.
He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?
I don't know.
The left one!
Which ones?
Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh, no!
How?
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?
The cute black ones I always wear.
No, which one?
The right or left?
Because the left one is lucky.
Come on!
What am I gonna do?
All right.
You're a monkey.
You're loose in the city.
Where do you go?
It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things.
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!
He'll be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me!
Search the building.
Take the first floor.
We'll take the rest.
What am I gonna do?
You stay here and wait by the phone.
Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.
Does anybody want to trade?
What do you want?
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?
-Why'd you leave it in the hall?
-I wasn't ready for it.
Have you seen a monkey?
I saw Regis Philbin once.
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
He's a black capuchin monkey with a white face with Russian dressing and pickles on the side.
Thanks.
How did it go today?
Oh, great!
It went great.
Really great.
Is that wine?
You want some?
Oh, I would love some.
But let's not drink it here.
I'm feeling crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?
Okay, but before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast I kind of wanted to run something by you.
You know how we were talking before about relationships, and stuff.
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.
Oh, God!
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.
Please don't hate me.
What?
You know Marcel?
I kind of lost him.
I can't believe this.
All I asked you to do was keep him in here!
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's partially my fault.
I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey.
You should have started with a pencil.
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's looking for him and I got -Who is it?
-Animal Control.
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?
Why?
Do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
I'm not allowed to have him.
If they find him, they'll take him away.
Well, now, see, you never ever told us that.
Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment!
Thanks for coming.
Somebody called about a monkey?
You know, that was a complete misunderstanding.
We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.
-My uncle Marcel.
-ls that who the monkey's named after?
Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.
Oh, my God!
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time.
I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this.
Have a seat.
We haven't met.
I'm Monica Geller.
Oh, my God, you are!
And you're Rachel Greene!
Luisa Gianetti!
Lincoln High?
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
Luisa!
Oh, my God!
Monica!
It's Luisa!
I went there too!
Luisa!
From homeroom!
You have no idea who I am, do you?
-No.
-Not at all.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.
Would it have been hard to say, "Morning, Luisa" or "Nice overalls"?
Oh, I'm so sorry!
It's not so much you.
You were fat.
You had your own problems.
But you.
What a bitch!
What?
You know what?
Be that as it may could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake?
Go, Bobcats!
I could.
But I won't.
If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Sorry.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something.
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?
No, I haven't seen a monkey.
Can you fix radiators?
Sure!
Did you try turning the knob back the other way?
-Of course!
-Oh.
Then, no.
-Taste this.
Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!
We may not know about radiators but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.
Aren't we in the middle of something?
But these women are very hot, and they need our help.
And they're very hot!
We can't, all right?
We're sorry.
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.
He's this high and answers to the name Marcel.
So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.
From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Something brushed up against my right leg.
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.
Look, Phoebe!
Oh, Marcel!
Come here!
Step aside, ladies.
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquilizer.
Run, Marcel, run!
Damn!
-Are you okay?
-I think so.
Oh, gosh!
We've been all over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!
-You don't know that.
-It's cold, it's dark.
He doesn't know the Village!
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!
Thank you very much!
I've said I'm sorry a million times.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign I don't miss Marcel anymore!
It's not like I did this on purpose.
No, this is just vintage Rachel.
Things just sort of happen around you!
You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing" oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?
What?
Hey, banana man!
This is so intense!
One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.
-What's with Phoebe?
-Tranquilizer dart.
Hi!
Did you order some bananas?
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?
Potassium.
Okay, where is he?
You're wasting your time.
What?
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey.
That's Patty.
Are you insane?
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey!
Gotcha!
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.
Take this up with the judge.
That's not my monkey.
The dress is mine.
Send it back whenever.
All right, I want my monkey!
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat.
In high school, I was prom queen and the homecoming queen and you were also there.
But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!
Heckles!
Can I have this?
For the most part.
If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life.
You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.
You have a chance to be the bigger person here.
Take it!
No.
All right.
Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her you shot my friend with a dart!
It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?
Or we can leave it on.
That's fine.
With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before No, it was my fault.
I almost lost your Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.
We still have that bottle of wine.
Are you in the mood for something grape?
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.
The neighbors must be vacuuming.
Well, as long as we're here and not on the subject.
I was thinking about how mad we got at each other before.
And maybe it was partially because of how we -Rachel?
-Barry?
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.
I think I'm still in love with you.
We have got to start locking that door!
Show us!
Come on!
-lt was such a long time ago.
-Okay, fine.
All right.
This is me in The Sound of Music.
See the von Trapp kids?
That's because I'm in front of them.
Big nun!
I thought that was an alp.
High school wasn't my favorite time.
I loved high school.
It was four years of parties, dating and sex and Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.
Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
My butt cheek is waking up!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I can't believe you'd actually say that.
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
No way.
Mr. Salty is a sailor.
He's gotta be the toughest snack there is.
I don't know.
You don't wanna mess with Cornnuts.
They're crazy.
Oh, my God.
You gotta come see this.
There's some creep out there with a telescope.
I can't believe it.
He's looking right at us.
Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated.
And not in a good way.
How can people do that?
You guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.
The One With the Evil Orthodontist Years from now, school children will study it as one of the greatest first dates ever.
-Yeah.
-I'll say, yeah.
It was unbelievable.
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.
-Have you called her?
-She'd know I like her.
That's crazy.
Guys.
It's gross.
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?
-I'm right.
Right?
-Yeah, let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people.
Come on.
Just do it.
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?
No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.
So, why didn't you say anything?
No.
Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase, "Yes, indeed-io".
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look.
What's going on?
-They're just talking.
-Does he look upset?
Does he look like he was told to shove anything?
No.
Actually, he's smiling.
Oh, my God.
Don't do that.
What?
What?
What?
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
See?
Hey, Rach.
How'd it go?
You know, it was actually really great.
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.
I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out.
Not a good day for birds.
Then we went to Bendel's.
And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel.
That's nice.
Now was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?
Right.
Well, we never actually got to that.
It was just so nice to see him again.
It was comfortable and it was familiar.
It was just nice.
That's nice twice.
Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Where have you been?
It was different with him today.
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?
-Why?
-I have my reasons.
He's engaged to another woman who happens to be your ex-best friend?
All right.
I know it's stupid.
I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.
No, it wasn't.
It was so nice having this little sink here.
Then with authority, hang up.
Will you just leave her the message?
Okay.
All right, fine.
"Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.
Give me a call when you get a chance.
Bye-bye.
Oh, God.
That's what you've been working on for two hours?
Hey, I've been honing.
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.
I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here honing for the last two hours?
-The telescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.
Go away.
Stop looking in here.
Great.
Now he's waving back.
We gotta do something.
I caught him looking into our place.
I feel like I can't do stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.
What's the matter?
I just Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was.
It was very, very good.
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?
If you want, I'll break it off with her.
No, don't do that.
Not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice.
Let's go away this weekend.
-This is all way too -No, we can go to Aruba.
When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.
We're starting to see some real progress.
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?
For future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working.
-Why isn't she calling?
-Maybe she never got your message.
Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps that means she didn't get her messages yet.
-Doesn't that make me seem?
-Desperate?
Needy?
Pathetic?
You obviously saw my personal ad.
How many beeps?
She answered.
This is where you'd use that "hello" word.
I won't talk to her.
She got my message and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.
God, I miss just being needy.
So how'd he take it?
Pretty well, actually.
How come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh, do l?
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?
I said that a little too loudly, didn't l?
You had what?
Sex in his chair.
What?
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
We still care about each other.
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.
It's nothing like me and Carol.
If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch right here, right now," what would you say?
If it helps, I could slide over.
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians I gotta go.
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.
I have things to do with my life.
I have a jam-packed schedule.
And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?
Mindy.
How are you?
Yes, I heard.
Congratulations.
That is so great.
Really, oh, God I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like.
Great.
Great.
So I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
So how's Mindy?
She wants to see me tomorrow.
She sounded weird.
I gotta call Barry.
It's me.
I just Mindy.
Mindy.
No, I figured that's where you'd be.
Hell is filled with people like you.
He's back.
The peeper's back.
-Get down.
-Get down?
And boogie.
I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
She may not even know.
I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about?
She was my best friend.
We went to camp together, she taught me how to kiss.
Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman.
-I feel so -Naughty.
-See you later.
-I'll walk with you.
When she taught you to kiss, were you wearing any kind of little uniform?
That's fine, yeah.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date -she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you call her?
I can't.
I left a message.
I have some pride.
-Do you?
-No.
Danielle, hi.
It's Chandler.
I'm fine.
Listen.
I don't know if you tried to call me because I accidentally shut off my phone.
That's fine.
That's great.
Okay.
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.
She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.
Hey, you.
So what's up?
We should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should.
I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.
Not like when I asked if those red pants made my ass look big.
I know things have been weird but you're my oldest friend, except for Laurie who's bitter because she lost weight and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face.
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.
Will you be my maid of honor?
-Of course.
-That's so great.
It is.
It is.
It is.
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.
-What?
-That's not all.
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.
I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.
What would make you think that?
Since the engagement, he's acted weird.
And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Really?
If it'll make you feel any better when Barry and I got engaged, he was weird too.
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.
What's what you were afraid of?
When Barry was engaged to you, he and l kind of had a little thing on the side.
-What?
-I know, I know.
When he proposed, people said, "He'll do to you what he did to Rachel".
And now I feel so stupid.
You are so stupid.
We are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my.
Four letters, "circle or hoop".
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?
I called and there was no answer.
I turned it off.
Mother of God, I turned it off.
Just like you told her you did.
Just pointing out the irony.
I went across the street to the doorman.
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?
Can I use your phone?
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device".
Radiator.
Five letters.
"Rdtor".
Yeah, is Sidney there?
Oh, this is?
Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman, so what?
Yeah, so what?
I live across the street, and I know about your telescope.
And I don't appreciate it.
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?
If I wanna walk around in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel Thank you.
That's not really the point.
The point is, that Mostly free-weights, but occasionally Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.
She said you looked pretty that day in the green dress.
The green dress?
Really?
She said you looked like lngrid Bergman.
Did she mention me?
She wants to know why you tie the towel around your head.
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?
It's a leave-in conditioner.
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.
Come on -in.
-Hello, sweetheart.
What you guys doing here?
We are here to break up with you.
Both of you?
We think you're a horrible person, and bad things should happen to you.
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.
I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.
Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.
Which one of us are you talking to there?
Mindy.
Of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.
When we were having sex in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was thinking of you.
Please.
That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.
You did it twice?
The first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.
Honey, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.
We'll start over.
We'll go back to Aruba.
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deal with the airlines?
What do you say?
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.
Jason Castalano 's choking on his retainer.
Oh, God.
I'll be right there, Bernice.
Look, please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.
See how he was sweating when he walked out?
If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there and take some punches.
This feels great.
I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?
Mindy, the guy is the devil.
He is Satan in a smock.
I know he's not perfect.
But the truth is at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber D. D.S. Oh, God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me.
And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
You okay?
Really?
Since I ran out on Barry at the wedding I've wondered whether I made the right choice.
And now I know.
I'm so glad.
Big day.
I'll give you this: Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
He's got the monocle, he's got the top hat.
Did you know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle, hi.
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.
Why are you here?
I've been calling, but I had your number wrong.
When I got the right one, there was no answer.
So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay.
I'm okay.
Maybe we could get together later?
That sounds good.
I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.
You got it.
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.
-There you go.
-Second date.
I don't know.
You don't know?
She seems nice, but her coming all the way here just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Mother, just once, can we go to lunch and not talk about what I'm wearing or where my career is going?
Or who I'm dating.
-Ready for the check?
-God, yes.
-I'll take it.
-No, darling.
I said I'll take it.
Here, take it.
Go.
Run.
Very sweet.
-And on what they pay you -Career.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm doing fine.
I'm afraid this has been denied.
That's impossible.
That's all right, dear.
Here you go.
The One With The Fake Monica How'd someone get your card number?
No idea.
Look how much they spent.
You only have to pay for the stuff you bought.
Still, it's just such reckless spending.
When somebody steals they've already thrown caution to the wind.
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.
95 on a Wonder Mop.
That's me.
You see, when I say geek, I mean The hell with it, you bought a $70 mop, you're a geek.
Oh, yuck.
Ross, he's doing it again.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp.
Stop humping.
Now, Marcel, come Come here, Marcel.
Oh, no.
Not in my room.
I'll get him.
You've got to do something about that.
What?
It's just a phase.
Well, that's what we said about Joey.
You'd think you would be more understanding.
I know.
But we're not.
Would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.
-Marcel, stop it.
Marcel.
Bad monkey.
-What?
Let's say my Curious George is no longer curious.
You are not still going over that thing.
-This woman's living my life.
-What?
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.
Look at this.
Look.
She buys tickets to plays I wanna see.
She shops where I'm afraid of the salespeople.
-She spent $300 on art supplies.
-You're not an artist.
I might be if I had the supplies.
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.
Really?
Let's compare, shall we?
Oh, it's so late for "shall we".
Do I horseback ride in the park?
-Do I take classes at the New School?
-No.
She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
-How about Joey Paponi?
-No, still too ethnic.
-My agent wants a more neutral name.
-Joey Switzerland?
Plus, I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm this big: Which I'm not.
Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin?
Stalin.
Do I know that name?
It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
But you're more plugged into that show business thing.
Joe Stalin.
You know, that's pretty good.
You might wanna try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin.
-I think you'd remember that.
-Yes.
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Hi.
Yes, this is Monica Geller.
I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were.
I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers Barbecue.
Oh, did l?
See, there you go.
-What are you doing?
-All right, great.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
I'm going to tap class.
To dance with the woman that stole your card?
To see what she looks like.
I'm sure her picture's up at the post office.
I should get to see who she is.
You're kind of losing it here.
This is becoming a weird obsession.
This is madness, I tell you.
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it.
Thank you.
-What do you think?
-Lots of things.
-Which one is she?
-May I help you?
No, thanks.
We're just here to observe.
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class.
Spare shoes are over there.
What does she mean?
I think she means "You dance a dance class".
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Really?
Do you see anybody you think could be me?
Last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.
-Let's not have that happen again.
-She could be you.
Let's get started.
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.
-Okay, I'm not getting this.
-I'm totally getting it.
Do you ever feel like you're so uncoordinated?
What?
You click when they click.
All right, everyone grab a partner.
All right.
And my dead mother said you are it.
I'm with Rachel.
Great, it's gym class all over again.
You can come up to the front and dance with me.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare?
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Okay, here I am.
So who's the new tense girl?
-She's your partner.
-Hi, I'm Monica.
Oh, Monica.
Hi, I'm Mon -Nana.
-Monana.
-It's Dutch.
-You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Pennsylvania Dutch.
And we're dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Hi.
-Hey.
Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.
She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone?
She says Marcel's humping is not a phase.
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.
Hey, he beat you.
She says, as time goes on, he's gonna start getting violent.
So, what does this mean?
I have to give him up.
I can't believe it.
This sucks.
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?
I know.
One day he's this little thing and then he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way to keep him?
No.
The vet said unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some monkey loving he's just gonna get vicious.
I just gotta get him into a zoo.
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know.
No, that's popes into a Vokswagen.
We're applying to a lot.
Our first choice would be a big state zoo.
You know, like San Diego.
Right?
But that may just be a pipe dream.
He's out-of-state.
My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.
We found the girl.
-Did you call the cops?
-We took her to lunch.
Oh, your own brand of vigilante justice.
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you.
She stole.
She's a stealer.
After you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget that.
I mean, she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit.
Which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Vokswagen.
I love that joke.
-No way.
No way did you do this.
-Monana was very brave.
We told them we were the Gundersons in room 61 5 only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire floor.
When they saw that we're short and have breasts.
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel.
Me.
Go, Monana.
You ladies are not the only ones living the dream.
I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know.
Don't wait up.
Oh, by the way tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
-Excuse me?
-There's an open call for Cats.
I'm thinking we sing "Memories" and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?
No, no, no.
Remember who you're dealing with here.
I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
That's because of your Amish background.
-What?
-You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Right.
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.
I was just like you.
And then, one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.
Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
I thought that movie was so incredibly boring.
That thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater".
I thought, "That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back".
That scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Wow.
Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Oh, God.
We didn't get into Scranton.
That was, like, our safety zoo.
They take, like, dogs and cows.
See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.
Marcel.
Marcel.
Marcel, no.
Good boy.
See?
How can nobody want him?
Somebody will.
You know, there already is a Joseph Stalin.
You're kidding.
Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people.
-You'd think you would've known that.
-You'd think I would've.
Hey, how about Joey Heatherton?
Come on, I told you I don't wanna go back to Joey.
What do you think a good stage name for me would be?
Flame Boy.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, it's technically not a zoo, per se.
It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about Marcel.
-Does he fight with other animals?
-No, no.
He's very docile.
Even if he were cornered?
Well, I don't know.
Why?
How is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.
What about a hammer or a small blade?
Why would he need a blade?
If he's up against an animal with horns you got to give him something.
Otherwise, it's just cruel.
-He got into San Diego.
-What?
We came back from our walk.
The phone was ringing.
He's in.
Did you hear that, Marcel?
San Diego.
San Diego.
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's good but I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you 20% of the gate.
Where have you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
I think I kissed an archbishop.
But, of course, it could've been a chef.
-Are you drunk?
-No.
-I'm lying.
I am so drunk.
-Oh, God.
You know what?
You could've called.
I've been worried Monica.
Water rules.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
The restaurant called.
They wanna know if you're showing up for work.
Nope.
Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
You're gonna lose your job.
This is not you.
No, it is me.
I'm not just the person who fluffs the pillows and pays the bills right away.
You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
I'm Monana.
Hello?
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second please.
Monana, it's for you.
The credit card people.
Hello.
Yes?
Oh, my God.
-Thanks.
-What?
They've arrested Monica.
-Hi.
-Hi.
How are you?
Not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.
How did you know I was here?
Because I'm Monica Geller.
It was my credit card you were using.
That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.
You have given me so much.
I'd never have gotten to sing "Memories" at the Winter Garden Theater.
Actually, you only got to sing "Memo" I can't believe you're here.
What will I do without you?
Who's gonna crash parties with me?
Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women and you're worried about who'll take you to the circus?
Well, not worried, you know, just wondering.
There's nothing to wonder about.
You'll go back to being who you were.
That's who you are.
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.
-I'm not actually Amish.
-Really?
Then why are you like that?
-You, by the door, in or out?
-ln.
-You're getting it all wrong.
-But at least I'm doing it.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego at gate 42A.
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.
All right, I wrote you this poem.
Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane.
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Okay, bye, champ.
There'll be a lot of babes in San Diego but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
I don't know what to say, Ross.
It's a monkey.
Just say what you feel, Joey.
-Marcel, I'm hungry.
-That was good.
Marcel, this is for you.
It's just, you know, something to do on the plane.
If you don't mind, I'd like a moment alone.
-Oh, sure.
Absolutely.
-Go ahead.
Marcel, come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Well, buddy this is it.
Just a couple of things I wanted to say.
I'm really gonna miss you.
You know, I'm never gonna forget about you.
You've been more than just a pet to me.
You've been more like a Okay.
Marcel.
Would you leave my leg alone?
Would you stop humping me for two seconds?
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch thy cheek.
-That's fine.
Thank you.
-Next.
I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
-Name?
-Holden McGroin.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
-Tell him.
-Tell him.
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?
You won't look at him.
I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
All right.
All right.
Last night, I had a dream that you and I were Doing it on this table.
Excellent dream score.
Why would you dream that?
More importantly was I any good?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Interesting.
In my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.
Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.
I love it when we share.
You okay?
I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.
I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.
The One With The lck Factor Hello, Rachel.
Get off.
Ooh, give me.
Can you see me operating a drill press?
I don't know.
What are you wearing?
Why would you want to?
For short-term work.
Till I get back my massage clients.
Pirates again?
No.
Nothing like that.
I'm just such a dummy.
I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home" workshop.
And they are.
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.
Thanks, Joey.
That's a good idea.
I could.
I could do it.
What is it?
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.
It's a whole big boob story.
-I could be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing because it involves being normal for a large portion of the day.
I could do that.
-What's that?
-My new beeper.
Why does a paleontologist need a beeper?
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
Help.
They're still extinct.
It's for when Carol goes into labor.
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.
A cool number and a possible name for the kid.
-See you later.
-Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan?
Young?
He's our age.
When we were.
-He's a senior in college.
-College?
Rob that cradle.
He's smart and mature and grown-up.
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.
This man-child has no problem with how old you are?
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue because I said I was 22.
-You what?
-What?
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.
-I am 26.
-There you go.
Can you hear that?
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.
Mr. Bing's office.
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.
Will he know what this is in reference to?
And he has your number?
I'll see that he gets the message.
Bye-bye.
Ross says hi.
This is so fun.
What do we do now?
Well, now I actually have to get to work.
"Most likely".
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
-Yes?
-What you doing?
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since his midterms.
Why, all of a sudden, are you so?
-What?
-Could tonight be the night?
I don't know.
He's a great guy and I love being with him.
But, you know things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.
-So, did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.
Would you let it go?
It was just a dream.
It doesn't mean This is it.
It's baby time!
All right, relax.
Just relax.
Be cool.
Yeah, hi.
I was just beeped.
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.
Yes, I am sure.
I do not perform those kind of services.
Services?
Oh, services.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.
That's right.
That's right.
JUMBO with a "U," sir.
You don't want me.
Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.
Alrighty, bye-bye.
How was the first day?
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.
It pays to know the man who wears my shoes.
Me.
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why?
Well, because, you know.
They don't like you.
-What?
-I thought you knew.
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.
Except for.
No.
Everyone.
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.
They used to like you a lot.
But you got promoted, and now you're Mr. Boss Man.
Mr. Big.
Mr. Bing.
Boss Man Bing.
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah.
They even do you.
They "do" me?
You know, like, okay: "Could that report be any later"?
-I don't sound like that.
-Yeah, you do.
"The hills are alive with the sound of music".
"My scone.
My scone".
I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.
That is so not That is so not That Oh, shut up.
-Did not.
-Up until I was 9 I thought "gunpoint" was a place where crimes happened.
-How's that possible?
-It's always on the news.
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint".
"Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint".
And I kept thinking, "Why do people continue to go there"?
I should go.
-Unless -What?
Unless you wanna stay over.
I mean, I'm going to.
So.
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Before we get into any staying-over stuff there's something you should know.
Is this, like, "I have an early class tomorrow" or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?
Well, it's somewhere in between.
You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not.
Well, I mean, I haven't ever.
Ethan?
Are you a virgin?
If that's what you kids are calling it these days, then yes, I am.
I mean, you're just such a good kisser I would never have known.
Well, I've excelled at every level I've been to, I just.
I just haven't been to that particular one yet.
I've kind of been waiting for the right person.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow.
You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.
Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man it is nothing like that.
Listen, listen.
You told me something that was really difficult for you.
And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.
Don't tell me I did it wrong.
Nothing wrong about that.
Here goes.
I'm not 22.
I'm 25 and 1 3 months.
But I figure that shouldn't change anything.
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.
I just thought you were naturally minty.
Listen as long as we're telling stuff I have another one for you.
I'm a little younger than I said.
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior in high school.
What we did was wrong.
I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?
-You never said your age.
-It's different.
My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling -Don't say it.
-ln love with you.
-Really?
-Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night.
Oh, God.
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.
Alrighty.
Bye-bye.
It's just easier that way.
-You told me about the last dream.
-No.
Forget it.
Why not?
Was I doing something particularly saucy?
All right.
Fine.
You were not the only one there.
Joey was there too.
All right.
Was there anybody else there?
You sure?
Nobody handing out mints or anything?
No, it was just the three of us.
So was it you and Chandler then you and me, or you, me and Chandler?
-You know what?
-What?
There were times when it wasn't even me.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Mon, Ethan called again.
-What?
-Ethan called again.
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.
Sometimes, things don't work out.
This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym?
I did not say anything.
I swear.
-He stopped by.
-Next time you talk to him could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?
Sorry.
"It's morphin'time".
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.
I gotta go.
Head rush.
One more, and then I have to go.
Cool.
Where you going?
A birthday party with some work people.
Work people?
Nobody told me.
I know.
That's part of the whole them-not-liking-you extravaganza.
A month ago, these people were my friends.
I'm in charge, but I'm not a different person.
Then come, hang out.
Let them see what a great guy you still are.
-You think I should?
-I really do.
But could we not go together?
I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss.
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.
This may take some time for him to get over it but, then at four, Muppet Babies is on.
Go deep.
Deep.
Deep.
Sorry, Shelly.
See, with the fun?
Last night was great.
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory".
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy Boss Man Bing.
Then I don't get it.
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.
You're the guy in the big office.
You're the one that hires and fires them.
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?
But they're not your friends anymore.
-I just want -But you can't.
But I just want Are you gonna?
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.
What about Andre?
He got a call from our cousin, Nathan.
Frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
That was gonna be my opener.
Have you guys seen those new hand dryers in the bathroom?
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm not 1 7.
I said that so you'd think I was vulnerable.
I'm actually 30.
I have a wife and a job.
I'm your congressman.
This is ridiculous.
We're great together.
We can talk, make each other laugh, and the sex.
I have no frame of reference, but I thought that was great.
-lt was.
-Then what's the problem?
Ethan, it's.
It's icky.
"lcky"?
You're actually gonna throw this away because it's "icky"?
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.
If you were older or I was younger or we lived in biblical times - I could really -No, don't say it.
Love you.
-Are your hands still wet?
-Moist.
Let's dry them again.
Or, like, "Could these margaritas be any stronger"?
Hey, Chandler.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thanks.
About the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.
-Sure.
-No problem.
You have to give them something.
That was Gerston, Santos, and who's the other guy?
-Petrie.
-Petrie.
Right, okay.
Well, some people are gonna be working this weekend.
Oh, that's nice.
Ross.
I'm here.
You are?
We were just.
What?
-Great.
Now I'm having a baby.
-What?
I'm having a baby.
I'm having a -The phone, the phone.
-I don't have the phone.
I'm hurt.
Let's go.
Come on, people.
Woman in labor.
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.
We're going to a hospital.
I can't look nice?
There are doctors there.
-Joey, get out of the fridge.
-All right.
-What is that?
-For the ride.
-Like in a cab -Save it.
-Hating this.
-Monica, come on.
Let's go.
Baby coming.
I can't believe I'm gonna be an aunt.
-I'll have a nephew.
-That's nice.
Get out.
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.
Here we go.
Come on.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
She's having my baby, and she's not here yet.
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.
When we talked, she said she'd already passed the mucous plug.
Do we have to know about that?
What'll you do when you have a baby?
I'll be in the waiting room, handing out cigars.
Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.
She could be giving birth in the cab.
Relax.
It's only $2 for the first contraction and then 50 cents for each additional contraction.
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?
You have to pick your moments.
Did I miss it?
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?
We might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.
I got this, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
You see what I mean?
The One With the Birth -"Stopped for a Chunky".
-Let it go, Ross.
I got an extra one.
You want this?
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau.
I understand you're thinking of having a baby.
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.
-How are your contractions?
-I love them.
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
-Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds.
Quartz.
Swiss quartz.
-Am I allowed to drink anything?
-lce chips.
-At the nurse's station.
-I'll get it!
-No, I'll get it.
-No, I'm getting it.
Hi.
Thought you might like some ice chips.
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else l do not believe we've met.
I'm Rachel Greene.
I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.
I'm your roommate's brother's ex-wife's obstetrician.
Oh, that's funny.
I want a baby.
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.
-Get up.
Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just fall down.
That's good too.
Knick fan?
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, lady Look.
Look at your man, Ewing.
He couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
-And who do you like?
-Celtics.
Celtics?
They couldn't hit a boat if Wait.
They suck, all right?
Shut up.
It's a rebuilding year Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.
There's no father.
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Right this way.
All the other pregnant women seem to be going in here.
They're tiny and chubby And so sweet to touch But soon they'll grow up And resent you so much Now they're yelling at you And you don 't know why And you cry and you cry And you cry And you cry and you cry And you cry -Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys.
Oh, cute.
No fair.
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?
-You'll get one.
-When?
Tell you what.
When we're 40, if neither of us are married what do you say we have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
I just meant hypothetically.
Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
What is it?
Is there something unmarriable about me?
Well?
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.
Look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and change?
It's an important day.
I want to look nice.
Has Dr. Franzblau been by?
I haven't seen him.
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.
What if the baby needs him?
What's the deal with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?
Yeah.
Why?
No reason.
Mom, we've been through this.
No, I am not calling him.
I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk.
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.
What do you mean "Joey who"?
Joey who?
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.
Yes.
Okay.
Hold on.
She wants to talk to you.
Take the phone.
Yeah, it's me.
No, we're just friends.
Yeah, I'm single.
Twenty-five.
An actor.
Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
So, what's the deal with this father guy?
If someone was having my baby, I'd wanna know about it.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood?
No.
-Maybe I should just go.
-Maybe you should.
Good luck and take care.
The Celtics problem is that the players run the team.
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.
-Breathe.
-Breathe.
You're gonna kill me.
-Fifteen more seconds.
1 4, 1 3, 1 2 -Count faster.
It'll be okay.
IKeep focusing on Jordy.
He'll be here soon.
-Three.
Two.
Who the hell is Jordy?
-Your son.
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We all agreed on Jamie.
Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend so we went back to Jordy.
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy.
We just passed by it during the whole Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.
Ow!
Leg cramp!
-I got it.
-I got it.
I'm doing it.
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.
No, you don't.
That is it.
I want both of you out.
-She started it.
-He did.
I'm trying to get a person out of my body here and you're not making it any easier!
Now go!
-Thanks.
-See what you did?
-Listen -Out!
Breathe.
Breathe.
What is that?
Something exploded.
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke.
Calm down.
Water breaking?
What do you mean?
What's that?
Breathe.
Breathe.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
That's disgusting.
I'm okay.
-This is so your fault.
-How is this my fault?
Carol never threw me out of a room before you.
There's a lot of things Carol never did before me.
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You're so threatened by me.
Hey.
Okay, all right.
That's it.
Get in here.
My God, you guys.
I don't believe you.
There are children coming into the world here and your fighting isn't the first thing they should hear.
So stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!
Who wants to hear something ironic?
Are they here yet?
Don't worry, we're gonna find them.
And until we do, we are all here for you.
Okay?
You were telling me about Paris.
It sounds wonderful.
There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel There you go, dear.
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria.
Where are Phoebe and Joey?
There's something sinister going on here.
If you find anyone, or parts of anyone scream.
And scream again.
-Help!
-Come on!
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!
Okay, everyone stand back.
Ow.
All right, good thing we're in a hospital.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.
Let's get that ball and really move.
Let's get I was just Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.
What are you gonna do, suck the door open?
Help!
Help!
And they found their bodies The very next day And they found their bodies The very next Mom, everything's going fine.
Ross is great.
He's in a whole other place.
No, he's gone.
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.
What do you mean "This might be your only chance"?
I'm only 26.
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.
Mazel tov.
It could be one hour or three.
But relax.
She's doing great.
So tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Not at the moment, I'm not.
Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Right.
Yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, really.
I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know where I do.
I try not to let work affect my personal life.
But it's hard when, when you do what I do.
It's, like.
Well, for instance, what do you do?
I'm a waitress.
Aren't there times when you come home at night and you're, like: "If I see one more cup of coffee".
Gotcha.
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom called me.
So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.
Ours is at the shop.
God, I hope she has my brains.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
I wasn't by myself.
I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.
-So did you see who won the game?
-The Knicks by 10.
They suck.
They're not so bad.
Come on.
Come on.
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or else Damn it.
Damn it.
Damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.
This should be the greatest day of my life.
My son is being born, and I should be in there.
Instead, I'm stuck in a closet with you.
I have been waiting for this as much as you.
No one's been waiting for this as much as I have.
You know what's funny?
You go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?
You're his father.
Who am l?
There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
This is so great.
Do you wanna explain that?
I mean, when I was growing up, my dad left and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail.
I barely had enough pieces to make one whole parent.
And here's this baby who has three whole parents who fight over who gets to love it the most and it's not even born yet.
It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
I'm sorry.
You were fighting.
Where are they?
-They'll be here.
-They wouldn't miss this.
Relax.
You're only at 9 centimeters, and the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.
That's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.
-I can't tell the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.
I'm hospital worker Ben.
It's Ben to the rescue.
Ben, you ready?
Give me your foot.
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
I see what appears to be a dark vent.
Wait.
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.
Wait.
You forgot your legs.
-Push.
Push.
-We're here.
We're here.
Where have you been?
Long story.
I need you to keep pushing.
I need Excuse me, can I have this?
There's too many people here.
There's about to be one more.
So if you're not an ex-husband or lesbian life partner, out you go.
-Bye-bye.
-Good luck, you guys.
Do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Out.
Here he comes.
Let me see.
I've gotta see.
A head.
It's huge.
How are you doing this?
You're not helping.
You're doing great.
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.
What do you see?
What do you see?
We got a head.
We got arms.
Oh, look at the little fingers.
A chest and a stomach and it's a boy, definitely a boy.
Legs, knees and feet.
He's here.
He's a person.
-Look.
-What does he look like?
IKind of like my Uncle Ed, covered in Jell-O.
Really?
You guys, he's beautiful.
Thanks, Pheebs.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
-How about Ben?
-I like Ben.
Ben.
Ben's good.
How come you never mentioned Ben before?
We just cooked it up.
That's what we were off doing.
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.
I know.
I know.
Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.
Ben, this is everybody.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thanks.
I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
I know.
I still am one of these.
Can l?
Okay, the head.
You gotta.
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.
I'm your Aunt Monica.
I will always have gum.
Ben I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around like this.
But I'll still always come back Iike this.
And sometimes, I may be away longer Iike this.
But I'll still always come back Iike this.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third and I'll go like this: He is so amazing.
Yeah, I know.
Look at him.
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.
Look, he's closing his eyes.
Look, he's opening his eyes.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Nope, this is pretty much it.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
I'll see you guys later.
He's closing his eyes again.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.
A little bit later.
Is he gonna sleep?
Is he gonna sleep?
Is he gonna?
Yep, out like a light!
This sure trumps the "Has he pooped"?
series.
Ross, we love him, okay?
But right now he's just a little fat guy.
How excited can we get?
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!
The One Where Rachel Finds Out Here's little Ben nodding off.
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
-Look, he's got Ross haircut.
-Let me see.
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just wanna kiss him all over.
That would be nice.
-Pardon?
-Nothing.
Just a little extra air in my mouth.
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.
Right.
Including the waffles last week, you now owe me 1 7 jillion dollars.
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?
I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research.
What kind of research?
Just, you know, science.
Science.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
It's a fertility study.
Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Actually, a little more than that.
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
I just go down there every other day and make my contribution to the project.
But at the end of two weeks, I get $700!
You're gonna be making money hand over fist.
That's funny.
Very funny.
This is great.
I actually know somebody who loves what they do.
But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work?
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.
The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys.
I just love barbecuing with you.
Men are here!
We make fire.
Cook meat.
Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Cute.
-Melanie called.
She'll be late.
-Okay.
How are things going?
Is she becoming your "special someone"?
I don't know.
She's pretty great.
What does she think of your little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex.
Crazy bitch.
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
How long did you think this barbecue would last?
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and.
-China?
-For the museum.
Someone found a bone.
They don't want us to have it.
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.
Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me?
"Hi, Ben.
I'm your father".
"I am The Head"!
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.
I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left.
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.
-There's this guy she met at -The coffeehouse?
Right.
So you do know who he is.
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.
-I have to go to China.
-The country?
No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.
Do you know who Carl is?
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
No.
Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
How can she, when she's never shown interest in you?
-Forget about her.
-He's right.
Please move on.
Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.
Of course, there they just call it "food".
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know.
All right, just give her this for me, okay?
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.
I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you.
I'm still on my first.
I just think you're nice.
That's when we started this fruit basket business.
We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers".
Like "The Three Musketeers," only with fruit.
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!
We're doing presents first.
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna complete the transaction, if you know what And you do.
Have you ever thought about being there for her?
What do you mean?
You know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
Think about it.
Okay.
I'm guessing this is from.
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.
Okay.
It's light.
It rattles.
It's Travel Scrabble!
Thank you.
This one's from Joey.
It feels like a book, I think it's a book.
And it's a book!
It's Dr. Seuss!
That book got me through some tough times.
There's a little child inside this man.
The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.
Oh, my God!
He remembered!
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.
I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little.
I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe it.
Remember when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Crystal duck.
No, no, no.
The "love" part?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!
I know.
This is really, really huge.
No, it's not.
It's small.
It's tiny.
It's petite.
It's wee.
I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.
Is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!
My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out but nothing ever happened.
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?
Given that he's in love with you he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee.
Ross?
All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!
-The country.
Is his flight gone?
Yes!
He's watching a woman do this: He's gone!
His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.
What'll you say to him?
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.
Right.
If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good, tell him now.
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?
No.
Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!
All right.
-Ross!
Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?
I need to talk to my friend.
Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass.
He's right there, in the blue jacket!
Can l?
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!
Then could you please just give him a message for me?
-This is very important.
-All right.
What's the message?
I don't know.
Excuse me, sir!
Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.
What?
Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
I think I blacked out there for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta find something fun for you.
You know what?
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.
-Me, again?
-Sure.
Why not?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be.
How do you mean?
I had you pegged as a guy who's always, "Me, me, me"!
But you, you're a giver.
You're the most generous man I ever met.
I mean, you're practically a woman.
-You're just saying that.
-No.
A woman!
-So?
-I missed him.
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.
Yeah, right.
No, I feel bad for her.
I do.
I can think of somebody other than myself.
All right, I'm going to bed.
-Happy birthday.
Hang in there.
-Thanks.
Yes!
Pizza coupons.
Okay.
You guys want help cleaning up this mess?
That'd be great.
So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper?
Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thought about it all the way there and I thought about it all the way back.
You know, it's Ross!
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.
-Sure!
-Sure.
I don't know.
This is just my initial gut feeling but I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!
The best part is you already know all about him.
You start on the 1 5th date.
But it would be like starting on the 1 5th date.
Another good point.
I mean, on the 1 5th date, you're already in a very "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.
What happens if it doesn't work out?
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?
-No, I'm just -Maybe there's someone else.
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.
Then why are you dumping my brother?
Hey, big Spender!
She's still asleep.
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?
The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.
Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!
It was like a ticker-tape parade!
I know.
My room's very, very close to the parade route.
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!
It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind but all my other senses are heightened.
It's like I was able to appreciate it on another level.
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know.
Neither did l!
Is something going on with O.J.?
Hey, great skirt.
Birthday present?
-From who?
-You.
I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought.
Doesn't Ross'flight get in in a couple hours?
At gate 27B?
Yeah.
Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.
I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
Why?
I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has happened, and you're already so I'm not "so".
Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first but I'll be good.
I promise.
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks.
You know what?
I feel I learned something.
You'll stick with this "all for her" thing?
What are you, crazy?
When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself!
I'm not against environmental issues, per se it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.
Fine.
Just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
I'm thinking about you.
So what?
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?
Happens to be a very nice guy.
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on.
Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else?
This is about us.
I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you What makes you think that?
Have you been involved where you haven't broken up?
No.
But it only has to happen once.
You and I both know we are perfect for each other.
Right?
So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?
I don't know.
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well, start looking.
-Wow.
-Exactly!
And I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Right!
You're right.
You know what?
I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.
I am so sorry!
If you wanna finish your drinks, please do.
-I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
-But.
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.
If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it.
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.
Hello!
-Where you going?
-Airport.
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.
I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth!
Chandler, relax.
This is a good going to the airport.
Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind.
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!
Yes, another successful case for the love doctor.
Excuse me!
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?
There's no Rachel!
Hey!
I got that.
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.
I can't wait for you to meet my friends.
You don't think they'll judge me?
-No, they will.
I just.
-Can't wait!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
