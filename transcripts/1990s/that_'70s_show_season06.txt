No, no the pancakes are an apology, I overreacted before of course you have to go to school - So thats it?
Its- no guilt?
- Thats right What a nice, warm family moment!
lets celebrateWith bacon Bacon Steven, how could you go out with another girl when I chose you?
Jackie, when I said choose between me and Kelso, I meant choose me,right then making me sit around and wait it out is immature.
I want what I want when I want it, what is so immature about that?
Forget it, Jackie, maybe your just not my type Whoa!
, that was rough, even Ive had a better day then you and my head swelled up to five times its normal size Oh, my God, Donna?
Madison has a course called The Social SignificanceOf Jedi Culture Mom, what- why are you doing laundry?
Its almost midnight Well, with your dad not working, I had to pick up a double shift at the hospital this is the only time I have to do it - Okay, dont do this - Do what?
Come down here in the middle of the night, doing laundry, looking like hell-- - Oh, excuse me - No, I Im just saying, your trying to make me feel guilty for leaving and its not gonna work I cant stay here, okay?
I have to go off and live my life.
I disserve that Mom, I disserve a chance Okay, okay, no need to use your squeaky voice I understand that you have to leave, I have bigger things to worry about then making you feel guilty - Eric, if you feel like you need to stay, I mean, we can talk about.
- No no!
- Were leaving next weekand thats final!
- Ok Yeah, its bacon and I dont care if you tell your mother.
She doesnt scare me!
Eric I almost forgot!
How could Steven say Im not his type?
Im everybodys type, thats my thing Well, at least you dont have to worry about me chasing after you anymore I mean, most of the stuff you and Hyde use to argue about?
I didnt even understand which makes me think youve become a complicated woman and I dont want none of that So, your really okay with us just being friends Yeah, I release you Fly, little bird, fly, fly away!
That was you - Michael, do you think Im immature?
- No, your almost fully grown WellSteven thinks so Apparently, Im immature and that skank in the leather jacket is what?
Cool?
Well I can be cool, people can change.
Olivia Newton-John did it for John Travolta and that movie was totally realistic.
Yummy!
Jackie?
Tell me about it, Steve?
Oh, Jackie, your so much cooler then that skank I was with before please take me back.

Is this really happening?
Shh!
Youll break the spell!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
All right, Donna put your chair here.
I wanna get Steven's attention, and with you next to me I'll look like a tiny porcelain doll.
Y'know Jackie, some people actually find me to be of normal height.
Sure if they're green and jolly.
- I can't take it.
Watching Donna lie out, knowing she's gonna go to college and I have to stay here, She's so, so Juicy.
My Juicy.
Well I'm not gonna stay here locked in the house just cause Jackie looks ridiculously hot in that bathing suit.
Later Forman.
- Bye bye juicy.
Ladies.
Ladies bodies.
I wish someone would rub lotion on my shoulders.
Think they're getting a little red.
Yeah, you should be careful.
Looks like you're starting to scab.
Oh, that's a burn about a burn.
That's a second degree burn!
Y'know Jackie, I think maybe Hyde's moved on.
No, no, no.
You don't just move on from Jackie Burkhardt.
I'm like the bottle, you need a twelve step program to break my spell.
Okay ladies.
All these sound waves are interfering with my sunrays.
Let's tan.
Alright, I'm gonna need you to lotion me up, darling, but only rub where you can see.
No roaming!
THAT '70s SHOW Join Together Hey, Mom, Dad, I have something I wanna tell you.
I've decided not to move away.
- What?
I'm gonna stay and put off college for just a little while or at least until you're well enough to go back to work.
- My baby, my baby, my baby.
Mom okay, this is actually kind of embarrassing.
You're actually really hurting me, yeah.
You mean I've been waiting eighteen years for you to get your butt out of this house, and now you're staying?
I signed over my pay check to you.
I want you to go buy yourself something pretty.
Or I don't know electricity.
Oh honey, thank you.
Red it wouldn't kill you to thank him.
- It might I just had a heart attack.
Speaking of which, I just found this in the garbage.
Why would you throw away the list of all the food the doctor said we couldn't have in the house?
Kitty did you look at that list?
If I had known what I was coming home to after my heart attack, I would've walked straight into that bright light and never looked back.
Oh come on, it can't be that bad.
I'll do it with you.
Cause what's good for the goose, is good for the gander.
Actually, Mom, Dad's the gander.
The male goose.
So it would be what's good for the gander is good for the goose.
Let's take a gander at what you're giving up with the gander.
That's how you do that.
Potato chips, other salty snacks.
Good advice, that doctor obviously knows what he's talking about.
Butter, heavy cream, cheese.
- Gone, makes a lot of sense.
Alcoholic beverages.
- Okay, that doctor's a quack.
God, it's gonna be so hard going off to college without you.
But we'll see each other on the weekends right?
Well you say that now, but then there's that weekend when you call home and say you have to study but I here Moose, the place kicker in the background, asking if you want another shot of tequila.
Eric, that would never happen.
I would never date a place kicker, it's Quarterback or nothing for me.
The more I think about leaving you, the sadder I get.
And the sadder I get, the more I wanna be with you.
Right now.
- Now?
Well yeah, I Whoa, alright this is great, it'll be like completely spontaneous, like I just Why are you talking?
- I'm sorry, I So it turns out that going away sex is even hotter than make up sex.
It's like these chips, they say now even crunchier, and you're thinking, oh man there is no way, but then you take a bite and it is crunchier.
Dude if something's crunchy, you should really have that looked at.
There's no time my friend, I have a distraught neighbour girl to attend to.
Dry your eyes baby, the lovin's on its way!
Toe ring.
- Oh, Fez you like?
Yeah, got a toe ring.
- On the little piggy that went to the market.
Steven what do you think?
- Can't resist toe ring.
Whatever.
I have all sorts of things now that I didn't have when we were going out.
Toe ring, tan lines, a tattoo.
- You don't have a tattoo, you're bluffing.
Do you have a tattoo?
Well we're not going out, so I guess you'll never know.
I think I'm gonna stop wearing them all together.
See ya.
Look at you watching her, you love her, man.
"Oh, baby, I love you so much".
Were you doing Jackie?
- Yes, yes.
Why am I even thinking about her?
Man, she's like Tahiti.
It's warm and it's beautiful and you wanna go there, but when you do you get bit by a mosquito and you get malaria and you're sick for the rest of your life.
She's obviously not over you either.
She's practically putting on a show to get your attention.
Just imagine it.
I love to dance.
Okay the doctor wins.
Eric and I boxed up all the liquor.
Man, look at all this, it's like Dean Martin exploded.
There were bottles in the liquor cabinet, the dining room hutch, my Mom's nightstand.
Oh no, no, that's for polishing furniture.
- Mom, there's lipstick on it.
It's just your luck Forman.
You're about to turn eighteen and there's gonna be no hooch left in the house to steal.
I mean avoid.
Do homework next to.
Pray near.
Come on!
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty boring around here.
You know what you should do?
Go to college.
Mom would it be too much to ask for Dad to be grateful that I'm staying?
Honey, we're all going through hard times.
You're giving up your future, I'm giving up my Schnapps.
Let's not compare our pain.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Donna was really upset about leaving, so I had to comfort her in a bedular way.
It turns out if I get her sad, she gives it away like goldfish at a freakin' carnival.
Eric, I think you may have found a secret open sesame to sex.
Make the lady cry.
Perhaps I should try that with my wife.
"Laurie here's a dead cat, now do me".
A little history Fez, I think Laurie has a lot of open sesames.
Like, "Hi, Laurie".
That usually does it.
Actually I only ever got as far as 'Hi'.
Fez, I did it with your wife!
God I have so much power over Donna now, it's like I know how Obi-Wan Kenobi feels.
"These aren't the droids you're looking for".
Man, I wish I could do it with Donna in a land speeder on.
That would be so awesome.
Hey, Steven, check out my new super sexy tattoo.
Hard to keep your hands off, huh?
Steven!
Sorry, here's your tattoo back.
I'll take that.
- Steven, why are you being so difficult?
Jackie, no amount of tattoos or toe rings, are gonna fix the fact that you have a lot to apologise for.
You're the one who should apologise.
- Then I guess we're not getting back together.
I guess we're not.
Oh, and by the way, you don't deserve a real tattoo.
But if I were to get one, I'd show it to Fez before I'd ever show it to you.
I hope she gets it on her hienie.
Jackie, it really bugs me that you and Hyde aren't back together, so as the man who used to pleasure you endlessly, I feel it is my obligation to step in and fix this, cause when I'm a cop I'm gonna have to deal with domestic cases like this all the time.
And the good news is, he'll have guns.
Yeah, this is gonna be a piece of cake.
Y'know they should have put me in charge of Vietnam, I would have had those people making out in a week.
Wow, Donna, that might be the last time you'll ever get to see Kelso make an even bigger mess of a problem.
Yeah I'm gonna miss that.
And I'm gonna miss you.
- Well I'm not gonna miss you two slobbering all over each other like fat girls in a house with free meat.
And that might be the last time that Jackie ever makes fun of us, fat girls, and meat.
Yeah What?
- Nothing, it just could be the last time that you and I stand beside the Vista Cruiser.
I just waxed her she's all slippy slidy.
Donna this might be the last time I bring you your toothbrush.
That's not my toothbrush.
Might be the last time I bring you the wrong toothbrush.
Hello, darling.
I see you are washing your unmentionables.
Yeah, do you know what gets out grass stains and Kailua?
Anyways I was thinking how sad you must be considering the mess you made of your life.
With all that sadness, do you not also get needy?
Y'know, I sorta do.
- Ali Baba, the treasure is mine!
I'm gonna go see if Carlos is home.
That Carlos is one lucky SOB to have a wife like mine.
Look, Hyde, I know you don't wanna tell Jackie that you're sorry, but there's gotta some things that you did, that you wish you hadn't done.
Like that time that you told me to eat that stuff, and I didn't know what it was, and then you licked your lips, and you rubbed you stomach and you were like 'Mmm it's really good Kelso' and then I ate it and then I wished I hadn't of done that.
Yeah, well, maybe with Jackie I was sort of impetuous and maybe a little rash.
Now see, that's something that Jackie oughta know.
Hyde say's that he was sort of infectious and he has a rash.
What?
- I'm just telling you what he said.
All right, look, Michael, Steven's the one who messed up the relationship.
He thought you and I were together but he was just wrong.
He fabricated the whole mess.
- Well somebody ought to make that clear.
Jackie wants you to know that there was a mess 'cause she was wearing the wrong fabric.
That can't be what she said.
- It's word for word, man.
Kelso, would you get outta here?
- What, I'm helping.
You're making me wanna kick your ass.
That better be the rash talking.
Busted, mister.
- You're like a damn cat.
I'm gonna make you wear a bell.
Bad health in a can, that's what that is.
The doctor said he wants nothing like that around here, and I agree.
All it takes is a little bit of will power, Red.
Even though you used to do something without thinking, you just have to grab a hold of those thoughts.
Can I get you a refill there?
Well there's a lesson for you.
You're welcome.
Oh hey, listen, son.
It means a lot to your mother, you staying here and helping out the family.
And as for me I There.
Doctor said I should write down my feelings.
Are you actually thanking me?
This is a list of yard work.
Yeah, the lawn thanks you for all that mowing you're gonna do.
You're welcome, Dad.
- Yeah, well.
All right, we're both men here.
Oh, God.
- What's wrong?
Nothing it's just this could be the last time that you and I watch Gilligan get hit on the head by the Skipper.
Eric, the more we talk about me going away, the sadder you get.
And being with you so much lately has been great, but afterwards  well you always used to look a little bit ashamed and I mean now you just seem depressed.
Oh no, no, I'm not depressed, Donna, you are depressed.
Okay, let's do this.
All this last time stuff, have you been saying that just for sex?
What?
Have I what?
This is not the one you're angry with.
You're disgusting.
That might be the last time we fight over you trying to get me to have sex with you.
Y'know Fez, this whole thing with Hyde and Jackie is stupid.
They both wanna be together, and they would in a second if they just thought that other one had said I'm sorry.
Eureka, Fez, Eureka!
I'm one step ahead of you my friend.
- Yeah I'll just lie to both of them, and tell them the other one said I'm sorry.
- I thought we were going to pan for gold.
Okay, here we go, let's make up.
All right, look, Steven, I heard what you said.
Yeah, I heard what wait a minute, you heard what I said?
Yeah, Michael told me, and just so you know I'm sorry too.
Too?
No, you're not sorry too, you're sorry one, I'm sorry too.
Wait, what, no Michael said that - Yeah, he said that I did my work, you two gotta clean this mess up yourselves.
So nothing's changed then?
- Guess no.
Forget this.
- Okay, enough.
Look, you guys, who cares who apologised first?
Jackie obviously wants to be with you, and you're here which means that you wanna be with her and I don't blame you, cause with that rash you ain't got a whole lotta choices.
All right, look, Steven, do you wanna be with me?
No, no a shrug's not gonna cut it.
Steven, I need you to say something.
All right, look, I'll even go first.
Steven I wanna be with you.
And you I Can you hang on a second?
Would you get outta here?
If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say please.
- Fine, please.
That's better.
Jackie, I do wanna be with you.
Because you love - Don't push it.
Okay, Steven, where's your beer?
- What?
Me, beer?
Kitty threw away all my beer, the Packers are down by 11, you're 18, I know you have beer, so where's your beer?
I don't want used beer.
Well, I might have a couple of fresh ones in the shower.
Yeah, I'm running low, I should probably hit the store.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Eric Forman's Basement Midnight Eric's 18th Birthday And midnight.
So long 17, in the words of Alice Cooper I'm 18 and I like it.
Happy birthday, Man.
Let's give him his present.
It's a case of 23 beers.
- Kelso?
- I deserved one, I carried it.
Yeah that tastes like 18.
Whoa, check out the new stereo.
Oh it plays records and 8 tracks, this thing's like right out of the future.
Yeah Donna gave it to me.
I think she feels bad that she's going to college without me.
So on the one hand I'm losing the girl that I've been in love with since I was 5 but on the other hand I get a crappy stereo.
Score!
What?
I mean she's going to dump you eventually.
Rock and roll never dies.
Kelso, Donna and I are fine, okay?
I mean, she's waiting until the very last bus to go to school tomorrow, so we can spend every minute of my birthday together.
We're just gonna make this work.
Eric, long distance relationships don't work.
Just ask my girlfriend back home.
Fez, you have a girlfriend back home?
No, don't you listen?
Long distance relationships don't work.
You guys, Donna and I are not gonna let a couple of miles come between us, okay?
This isn't the end of the world.
My world is over, man.
Forman, I know what you're thinking.
Donna's gonna go to school, meet a whole bunch of people way cooler than you and probably fall in love with someone else.
-And you don't think she will?
- Oh, I know she will.
My advice to you is drink up.
I can't believe she's just leaving, y'know?
Hasn't she heard of a little something called sacrifice?
Y'know, she sacrifices an education, or a career, or a future of any kind, and in exchange she gets me.
You don't offer much in the way of excitement, but if it's the same old same old a girls after, look out.
I never deserved her anyway Well we're here for ya.
Here ya go, dry your eyes.
Thanks you guys, I feel better.
I think we all do.
Alright buddy, come on let's get you to bed.
Big boy lets tuck you in.
Alright, sleep tight buddy.
The next morning Oh good lord.
What, what?
Happy birthday, dumbass.
That '70s show Season 6 Episode 3 Magic Bus Okay Red, remember don't tire yourself out today, because tonight is a special night in the bedroom.
Bob Newhart's on Carson?
No silly, it's been a month since your heart attack.
Tonight's the night the doctor gave us the okay.
Y'know the okay.
Kitty I don't like clues, just say it.
- The okay to make love.
- Don't say that.
Well tonight is my only night off this week.
Let's not talk about it in front of the boy.

Let's not talk about what in front of the boy?
Ohhh, you guys are planning a surprise party for me tonight, aren't you?
Well first of all, thank you.
Second of all let me just say, 18 years old, not too old for ice-cream cake, okay.
So where's my special birthday breakfast?
Oh my goodness, I've been so busy this morning I forgot all about your breakfast.
Okay I'll play along.
La de da, here I am, completely unaware that I'm about to get my super birthday breakfast with 4 pieces of bacon.
- Honey, there is no breakfast.
- Mom gags over, gimmie the bacon.
Are you sure you want bacon?
It's fattening.
You barely fit into your best dress as it is.
Eric honey, let me make it up to you.
How about tonight instead of hanging out around here you just you take the night off.
Oh, because there's 'no party'.
I'm with ya.
I'm with you.
Steven I am so glad we're back together.
I thought I'd lost my little Puddin' Pop forever.
Wanna hear something sick?
I actually missed you calling me Puddin' Pop.
How many times have I told you guys not to make out on my bed?
You guys are like cats, you don't even listen.
Down!
You're leaving tonight so technically this isn't your bed anymore.
Besides, I just can't keep my hands off my Puddin' Pop.
- Puddin' Pop?
- Puddin' Pop?
Is that supposed to be me?
I've never heard that name before in my life.
Donna, you're amazing.
Taking the midnight bus tonight, just so you can spend my whole birthday with me that I swear that is right up there with not wearing a bra in public.
Wow you're taking this really well.
Yeah well, I know I have a history of ruining these things.
Birthdays, holidays, that perm that made you look like a poodle.
But I'm not gonna do that okay?
I'm not gonna ruin our last day together.
Oh, so you're taking the toaster?
What?
Ah, it's just y'know we bought it together, so I guess I kinda though it was like our toaster.
What do I know, it's not like I'm the one going to college right?
You are - with my toaster.
- Okay Eric if it's a problem - Oh, it's a problem.
You thought you could just sneak it out of town without telling me cause you knew it was wrong, didn't ya lady?
Okay Eric, I don't know what your deal is, but you're ruining our last day together.
I wouldn't be me if I didn't ruin it!
You know what?
Enjoy your toast, I hope it burns!
Oh man, Casablanca.
This is the part where Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman they'll always have Paris.
What's his problem?
The guy owns a bar, man.
he'd be beating those French sluts off with a stick.
How'd it go with Donna?
I ruined it.
And I knew I was ruining it, while I was ruining it.
I just kept on ruining it.
Now Bogey y'know that guy knows how to let a woman go.
"Here's lookin' at you Kid".
I threw a toaster.
Hey if you wanna be like Bogey you gotta let her go.
Only Bogey'll get another hot girl.
You, I see Star Wars conventions and fat chicks.
Hey, Bogey and I have more in common than you think.
Of all the teenage burger hangouts, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine, only to walk right back out again.
Play it Fez.
It'll cost you a Baby Ruth.
Now I want a Baby Ruth.
Hey, let's go to the Hub.
- Uh, I can't.
- Let me see that.
Forman, I think there's a rule that when you turn 18 you can't let Scooby tell you the time anymore.
Shows what you know Hyde, that's Deputy Dawg.
I can't wait until all of Donna's giant clothes are out of the closet.
I don't even go in there now.
I'm afraid I'll fall into one of her big shoes, and never be heard from again.
Well I guess I must be Eric's best friend, 'cause I'm the only one took the trouble of getting him a birthday cake.
It's good too.
Maybe we should think about getting him something else.
What do you think, Puddin Pop?
Why does everybody keep calling me that?
My name's not Puddin' Pop, I've never heard that name before in my life.
Forman's dead.
Hey if you guys think that's funny, you should hear what Steven calls me.
He calls me his Hey!
Oh hey, that's some good cake.
So I heard Eric threw a toaster.
It's almost as bad as the time he called you a poodle head.
Which he brought up again today.
He's not good.
Well I'm just surprised Eric was able to lift the toaster.
Donna I've been looking all over for you.
I'm so sorry I was such a jerk earlier.
It's your last day, and it's my birthday I just I wanna spend it together.
Eric it's okay, I know you don't care about the toaster.
You're sad I'm leaving and I'm sad too.
Hey don't take him back, he threw a toaster.
Hey, shouldn't my surprise party have started already?
We keep telling you there's no party man, it's like you're deaf.
Eric there is NO party.
No, no, no, why are you here?
You can't be here.
Oh right, I'll go outside, then I'll come back, and you guys yell 'surprise!
' and I'll yell 'you got me!
' Eric honey, there's no party.
What?
How can there not be a party?
Mom, what is more important than your only son's 18th birthday?
Okay fine.
For the first time since his heart attack your father and I are having intercourse.
Sexy Okay let's get this over with.
Happy birthday.
I can't friggin' believe my Mom didn't plan a friggin' party on my 18th friggin' birthday.
The only party going on in this house is in their bedroom, and that's all ugh!
Forman, you hate it when your Mom does stuff for your birthday.
Remember 2 years ago?
I'm 16.
Hey, your mother worked very hard on this party, now you be nice to her or we're cancelling the puppet show.
Oh sit on the tiny horse, so I can take a picture.
I can't mom I'll kill it Yeah okay, fine but she should have done something for me.
Well we're here for ya.
We scraped together a few bucks and got you something you can actually use.
What is it?
It's a knob for your new stereo.
Wait, did you guys just take this off while I wasn't looking?
Eric, there's an old saying.
'Don't look a gift horse in the knob'.
And what happened to my Led Zeppelin 8 track?
You mean gift number 2.
Well hello handsome.
Boy am I tired.
I think I'll just go to bed.
Red Forman what has gotten into you?
I just think that there are more appropriate ways for us to spend our time.
Like you knit and I'll whittle.
That's a nice life.
Red, I know what this is about.
You're afraid of getting physical so soon after your heart attack.
Kitty, you know I love what we do.
Am I willing to die for it?
Now you just relax, nurse Kitty is here to take care of you.
Well, big paw's on the 11 so it's almost time to take Donna to the bus station.
This is it you guys, she's really going away.
Forman, we have just the thing to make you feel better.
Psst.
Another case of beer!
Oh, I'm just not really in the mood to put on a dress.
But thanks anyway Puddin' Pop.
Aw!
Look man, if you want her to stay, can't you just ask her to stay?
You have no idea how badly I wanna do that but I just, - I don't think it'd be fair to her.
- Fair to her?
Who cares what the woman thinks?
This is America.
I already screwed this up once today, I am not gonna screw this up again.
I'm gonna fight every bad instinct I have, and I'm just gonna let her go.
Like Bogey did in Casablanca.
Wait so that's it?
Nobody's gonna drink beer and put on a dress?
Hey Fez, you wanna beer?
Sure Jackie!
What did you do to my room?
Your room?
Uh, read the wall Donna.
Jackie, this is still my room until I leave, so will you get out and give me and Eric a few minutes alone?
But I still have to paint the heart over the 'I' - Out, shoo.
- Oh God, alright Donna!
Okay you're all packed.
I can't believe my baby's leaving.
Well hey, I'll still be around, sir.
Why would I wanna pal around with you?
All you did was dirty her up.
You should probably get going.
Happy birthday, Eric.
Donna this is the nicest thing anyone's done for me all day.
Make a wish.
Oh boy, do I smell cupcakes?
So I'm really gonna miss you.
Yeah me too.
Donna I'm really happy for you.
Well, bye I guess.
Donna wait!
- Donna you have to stay.
- Stay?
You're supposed to tell me to go.
No if you leave you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but in a couple of weeks or at least by Christmas.
Oh my God, you're such a loser.
- Donna - Here's looking at you, dork.
What did you wanna tell me?
Have a safe trip.
Thanks.
Donna, what?
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.
This whole time I was thinking I was supposed to leave, and then when the time came to get on the bus, I couldn't do it.
I'll figure college out later, all I know is I wanna stay here with you.
Oh my God, Donna.
that's what I wished for.
Donna we didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Did you guys get him drunk and make him wear a dress?
Yes, but I've been wanting to do this for sometime.
To tired?
Yeah that was pretty silly.
Knit and Whittle?
Yeah I hate to whittle.
Where's the aspirin?
Oh like you've never woken up in a dress before?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Guys, guess what I just heard in the ladies bathroom?
- Fez, what were you doing in the ladies bathroom?
- Oh, spying, eating lunch, y'know.
I heard two girls say they did not want to go to college as virgins.
Yeah, I caught that wave last year.
So I'm thinking if horny virgins are dying for sex, then hunting horny virgins I will go.
By the way Fez, it's not pronounced virgin; it's pronounced vir-GIN.
- I thought it was virgin?
- No, no Hyde's right it's vir-GIN.
Oh now I will not sound stupid in front of the beautiful vir-GINS.
Oh my God.
That's - that's the girl, - that's the one I made it with at the Molly Hatchet concert.
- That's Brooke.
Man, no one sleeps with that Brooke.
When we were sophomores and she was a senior, she turned down her science teacher, and he drove a Corvette.
Yeah, she was like some sort of mythical creature, like a unicorn.
It's weird, it seems like she's moving too fast.
It's probably cause all my memories of her are in super jiggle sexy slo-mo.
Well all I know is that's her, and I did it with her, and I'll prove it.
Hey Brooke, now I know this is kinda awkward but could you tell my friends over there about you and me at the Molly Hatchet concert?
Do I know you?
Hey I'm sorry to interrupt but uh Burn!
No, it's me Michael from the concert.
Okay, I've been looking for you for weeks and I think you were so blissed out, and that does happen, that you gave me the wrong phone number.
But the good news is I wasn't a dream.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
No, Michael Kelso.
'Let's do it in the men's room, it's more romantic.
' No, what I kicked that kid out of the handicapped stall so we could have more room!
That 70's show Season 6 Episode 4 The Acid Queen Sir Martini What is Brooke's deal, man?
I mean, most girls lie about doing it with me when they haven't.
This the everything is backwards.
Yeah, this is just like Freaky Friday, but unlike that charming little movie ..
your story has no basis in fact.
It does too, except it's just the girl is avoiding me.
- I mean, how do you get a girl to come to you when you repulse her?
- Yeah, Eric?
Well, I like to put a hot dog on the end of a stick, and hide in the bushes so Donna, so how do you know Brooke anyway?
Did you guys jump out of a cake together or something?
Yeah!
No moron.
When she was a senior we worked on the school paper together.
I think you know Brooke cause there's a secret club in this town, made up of all the hot girls.
It's a secret hot girls club.
There's no secret hot girls club, believe me I'd know.
Uh huh, well I'm gonna take off.
I have to get to my secret hot girls meeting Why doesn't Brooke like me?
I am a gentleman.
Oh yeah, you lied about doing it with a hot girl in the men's room.
You're Cary Grant.
Steven, you've been quiet.
Do you think Brooke's hot?
Do you really want me to answer that question?
Oh I think we all do.
Steven, it's no big deal.
Do you think she's hot?
Oh well, I guess since you're not setting a trap, I can answer honestly.
- Yeah, she's freakin hot.
- Ah ha!
See, I trapped ya.
Now take it back or I'll pinch you.
Jackie, if you pinch me, it's gonna cause a serious problem in this relationship.
Fine Oh hey Jackie.
Are any of your college bound friends vir-GINS?
It's pronounced virgins, Fez.
What?
But no, but Hyde said Oh you magnificent bastard.
Sorry buddy.
By the way it's pronounced bas-TARD Fez, if you wanna find virgins, go where ugly girls pray to get pretty: The local House of Worship.
House of Worship?
Are you sure you don't mean the House of Pies?
No Fez, I mean the House of Worship.
I'm going to the House of Pies.
So, how's it going at Point Place Junior College?
Well the education's not too great, but the upside is it's next to the Dairy Queen.
First day of class we all got free Peanut Buster Parfaits.
Hey guys.
- Kelso, what are you doing?
!
- I'm looking for Brooke's phone number.
I mean why won't she admit that we did it?
Kelso, there are racehorses, and there are donkeys.
And you are a great donkey, you are like top donkey.
But she's a racehorse, and guess what?
She don't want no donkey.
She might.
Look, we had a great time together, and not just cause of the sex part, but because we had a really great time.
Donna, please help me find her.
Okay, I'll give you a hint about where she works.
It's in a quiet building, you could try and check her out on a date, but she's probably booked for the future.
She's a travel agent?
She translated her love of books into a career.
She's a translator.
"Trabaja en la biblioteca", Kelso.
She's the translator, not me Donna.
Y'know, enough with these brain teasers.
You tell me where Brooke works, and I'll return your underpants to safety.
Kelso, aren't you a little old to be stealing Donna's undies?
A collector never stops collecting, Eric.
The library, Kelso, she works in the library.
Now will you put my underwear back you perv?
I lied.
Ooo wow, those male actors are gorgeous.
Y'know I think that Robert Redford is so hot.
He's hotter than the sun.
He's extremely handsome.
You know who I think is sexy?
James Caan in the Godfather.
Now, if he made me an offer, I sure couldn't refuse.
Yowsa!
Do you mind?
I'm sorry; I thought we were having a conversation.
Y'know what Steven, I actually think that every guy on TV, and in life is hotter than you.
Jackie, I know what you're doing, okay?
I said Brooke was hot, and now you're totally insecure.
Oh I am not insecure, okay?
This is a designer sweater, this is designer eye shadow, and those are designer shoes, and they make me feel incredibly secure.
You know who else I like?
That little fella who plays Colombo.
I just wanna give him a bath.
Steven, why can't you just say that Brooke's not hot?
It's common relationship courtesy.
If you can't do this what will you do when I'm old, and ask you if I have crow's feet around my eyes?
By the way, that's already starting.
You've never been in a relationship, have you son?
What, when she asked if Brooke was hot, I should have lied and said no?
Being honest and screwing yourself is clearly the better plan.
Sweetie, white lies help relationships.
Like, 'Kitty, even though your pot roast was overdone, I still loved it.
' Oh for the love of God, I did love it.
You're a pot roast genius, okay?
It was like eating gold.
- So you're saying lying is good?
- Exactly.
Now go do the right thing, and lie to the woman you love!
- Red, this is crazy right?
- Yeah, they're all nuts.
Except you, sweetheart.
Look at all the smart, lonely girls.
Little ones, big ones; it's like a virgin pumpkin patch.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'd like an order of books please.
- Could you be more specific?
- Could you be more beautiful?
Could you be more lame?
Yes - Excuse me, I'm trying to read.
- Don't be a sissy.
- Y'know what?
Here's a firecracker, go live a little.
- Thanks Look, I know why you're here and I'm sorry, you're not my type.
I was high school valedictorian and you're the antithesis of that.
The anti-who-of-what?
Exactly.
Okay no, come on don't be like that okay?
Look I really like you and I just thought that maybe we could go out some time, like for coffee.
and then if that went good, then we could go to a movie.
and then when we really start to trust each other, you can tell my friends how we did it at the Molly Hatchet concert.
Look, I don't make it with guys at concerts.
I read two periodicals a week about the Dewey Decimal system, which I'm sure you've never heard of.
Okay I have heard of Dewey Decimal it's Donald Ducks nephew.
I can't believe Brooke.
I mean standing there at the library, totally resisting me.
I can't believe we have a library.
I know, what is it like invisible?
No, no, you know that parking lot where we drink beer in?
Okay, well you know that wall that we lean up against?
That's the library.
Well then, guess who has peed on the library?
Y'know for the first time in my life, I hope there's not a secret hot girls club, because if there is, I bet Brooke said awful things about me at their last meeting.
Order bitches.
The secret hot girls club is now in session.
Now, last meeting we all decided to go braless, and I just wanna report that operation bazooma bounce is driving the boys insane.
Hi, my name is Brooke and I've been a hot girl for 6 years.
Hi Brooke.
And I just wanna let everyone know that Michael Kelso asked me out, and I resisted his charms and turned him down.
- But he's irresistible.
- That's what I thought, but it's a lie, a lie I tell you.
Then it's official.
No secret hot girl will ever date Michael Kelso ever again.
Okay that's great, that's great.
Now this calls for dancing bubble kiss time!
Kelso, there is no secret hot girls club.
Well of course the president won't admit it.
Y'know I don't care is there's a club or not, dancing bubble kiss time is just a fabulous idea.
Well all I know is that Brooke and I had a romantic night together at the concert.
Why is she pretending like it didn't happen?
Well maybe she's embarrassed.
I mean she's used to dating really brainy guys.
Yeah, not guys who set their own pants on fire.
On a dare.
And I won a dollar.
Kelso, if you want Brooke to like you, y'know maybe you should go down to the library and show her you can be smart.
I hate the library.
The only good thing about it is that you can check out Playboys.
I mean they have every issue since it started.
Wait, every issue?
Are you telling me that they have the one with Pamela Sue Martin, televisions Nancy Drew, in a grotto, straddling the world's luckiest boulder?
Uh, they have periodicals you say?
What is wrong with Steven?
I mean why won't he just say that Brooke's not hot?
Because he doesn't know how to lie.
He's an orphan; he never had a mother to teach him how.
I mean, how do I know he loves me if he doesn't obey me?
Well, you've chosen a strong man, Jackie and they don't always obey.
Now, do I think he should have said that other girl wasn't pretty, yes, but you have to pick your battles.
Wait, no, I wanna be right all the time.
And you will be.
After a few years they just they give up.
Okay, watch.
Red, could you go to the drug store and get me a Ladies Home Journal?
But I just It's all frosty.
Aw Crap!
Jackpot my friend.
Not only did I get Nancy Drew, but I also got Margot Kidder, Superman's Lois Lane, in an outfit that, let's just say you don't need x-ray vision to appreciate.
Well get those outta here, man I'm trying to impress Brooke with my intelligence.
Here she comes.
Say Eric, this encyclopaedia of scientific terms has really taught me something.
See by lifting this encyclopaedia of scientific terms above my head, I'm using my body's stored energy, also known as uranium.
Um, actually it's known as calories, but I do believe at some point you were exposed to radiation.
Alright look, I don't know what you have against me, but I'm not leaving here until I convince you to go out with me.
That's the man who gave me the firecrackers, Mom.
I gotta run.
You wanna check something out?
No, um is there someone else who can help me?
Like a man.
So you wanna check out those Playboys, or not?
Okay, fine.
I'm a man, I would like these Playboys.
Well, you can't have them.
I want you to get in your car, buy some flowers, give them to Donna, and thank God an actual live woman lets you touch her.
Yes ma'am.
Okay Steven, I think I figured out a way to end this situation where everybody wins.
Now, listen to this question carefully.
Is there anyone you said was hot - like Brooke, who you really don't think is hot - like Brooke?
Well I could lie and say yes.
Then do it.
I don't care of you don't mean it; it's the words that count.
Jackie, I'm not gonna lie.
Fine.
Then y'know what, I don't know how to fix this.
'pick you battles.
' Fine.
Steven, I don't care if you think she's hot, because that's how you really feel.
Thank you.
Hey Steven, will you go to the drug store and get me a Vogue magazine?
But I just It's gonna melt.
Crap!
Well, my plan to have sex with virgins failed, so I've widened my search from virgins to everyone.
So, basically you're back to where you started this morning.
Not really, I had some pie.
I've done less in a day.
Well Donna, turns out Brooke doesn't like intelligent men.
Kelso, you didn't have sex with her man, just let it go.
Michael, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, about what?
About our night together at the Molly Hatchet concert.
Excuse me.
Burn!
Burn!
Burn, Burn!
BurnBurn!
Burn We totally did it!
Michael, I just found out I'm pregnant.
I never touched her.
Psst kid, hey you see this?
That's a Playboy.
And inside are things beyond your wildest dreams, magical glorious things.
So if you toss it in your book, and you check it out for me, I'll let you have a look see, what do ya say?
You're pathetic, just go buy a Playboy, you loser.
Loser?
Hey I'm not the one reading Hardy Boys.
For your information the stolen money was hidden in the grandfather clock!
Who's the loser now?

Well, she has to there in love Again, Kelso, Laverne and Shirley are not Lesbians trust me, there one bottle of wine away from making out just like you two!

Its about you taking advantage of my daughter like a sneaky foreigner Oh, wait, dad, look, I stayed home from college to take care of you and mom in your hour of need, okay you owe me!
That is just like a woman to bring that up You know, Laurie could get in a lot of trouble, too - What kinda trouble?
- Big trouble, dad, she could go to jail or back to jail!
Well, come on, Its like where has she been for the past two years All right, fine, I wont volunteer anything but if he asks me a direct question Im not lying - Oh, you wont have to.
Ill do all the talking for you - Well, youll be good at that!
And I guess it might be fun to just sit back and watch Tarzan here crumble before the full force of the U.S Government Okay, thats it.
Anwar I can deal with.
Tonto, in the ballpark, but TarzanTarzan is a white guy Dont sass me, Tarzan!
Michael, there is no way Brooke said your off the hook, Okay, I bet she said Im gonna take every penny you have you irresponsible bastard because thats what I would say No, she definitely said Off the hook Man I am one tall, cute, lucky kid!
So thats it, man?
Its like this thing with You and Brooke never happened Yeahwell no, I mean, theres still gonna be a baby out there but my lifes back to normal sort a I mean, its kinda weird but Im not gonna think about it cause I dont need to you know I should be happy right now.
You know, I am happy, right now!
Yeah, I think Yeah, think, feel, look deep inside like deep, deep inside almost to China Theres a good guy in there You know what?
Dont lecture me, okay?
I went to her and I tried to talk to her and she said it was cool which is awesome because this could, like, screw up my whole life!
Yeah, man, you know you gotta stay focused if your gonna invent those quadruple Oreos Those are a secret, man No yeah, this is good.
Why put yourself out for some kid, children grow up without dads all the time - Right - Yeah, like Steven Well, I dont want him ending up like Hyde hair all frizzed out with angry thoughts And violent, too Kelso, you know what you should do?
But you're not gonna do it because your to much of a tool You know what?
Its real easy to talk about the right thing to do when its not your life Tool Oh, Steven your sensitive to this because your father ditched you, too That is so foxy Hey, why dont we go down to my room, tell you about the time my mom got so loaded on mouthwash, she lost our rent money at the track Okay, you two claim to be married and living here to verify this Im going to separate you all and ask you a series of questions about the couple.
- Let me remind you your all under oath - under oath?
I mean under Oath, bravo!
Okay, first question, What kind of toothpaste does Fez use?
Um, I brush my teeth with Colgate it is the only thing that cuts through the, um, milk duds - Who the hell cares about toothpaste?
This kid and my daughter are - Happy, happy, happy!
Iwait, w-why am I under oath?
cause if I say crest and the answer is minty crest I Mean, thats, like, uh, perjury, was-whats gonna happen to me?
wha-Oh, my god why are you writing this down?
How long did Fez and Laurie date before they got married?
Who needs to date?
I had her in the sack faster than you can say Corn on The cob..
Speaking of dates, I made an incredible date nut bread The secret is to oak the dates in some good, strong rum, which reminds me, who needs a drink?
I know I do.
I dont know how long they dated, I-oh, my God, Im going to prison arent I?
Im gonna get shanked What is Fezs favorite T.V show?
Uh, well, it depends.
Basically I just flip until I see nipples Sometimes I feel like a loaf of bread, everyone keeps taking a slice of me until all thats left are two crusty pieces that nobody wants and I just want to scream Appreciate me, Damn it but I dont, why?
Because my mother always told me that nice girls shouldnt make a fuss and now I am a flippin doormat Okay look, man.
Prison is not an option for me, okay?
I cant pee in front of other people WellDespite a few interesting answers and one recipe My judgment is that your marriage is legitimate.
Congratulations!
All right, Pepé and I are Americans No wonder this country is going in the toilet What was that, sir?
Nothing, nothing he said he has to use the toilet, thats why hes been so quiet If your trying to protect your daughter, dont worry We never go after the bride especially such a pretty one If there was a crime committed, wed only be interested in this one, so if theres something you want to say, by all means, say it Fine, I will I just wanted to say these two kids are married and very much in love In fact, Ive never seen a love like this Thank you, Mr. Red.
It means a lot Hey, what about thanking me his guy tried to break me but lucky for you double-O Forman is rock solid Wow, you really are pregnant They make them really tiny now quarter pound, my ass Hey!
I need to talk to you Kelso, thats great!
Here take my seat sit down Ill just be right over there Good for you!
All rightAt first when you told me I was off the hook.
I was, like, totally psyched, right?
But then I started to think about it and - I dont wanna be off the hook, I wanna be a part of this kids life - Michael, I didnt let you off the hook to be nice.
I just dont think you understand what I means to have a baby No but I doI means, taking him to teeball games, and teaching him how to ride a bike and taking him to the doctor when hes sick And what if its a girl?
Uh, its not gonna be a girl we did it standing up!
Uh-huh Okay, maybe this will change your mind I went and got some stuff today, this little sweater, to keep him warm andthis little hat, to keep the sun off of his face I got some pop rocks cause I always wanted to see a baby eat popRocks Michael, If you get involved, Im just gonna have two babies to take care of instead of one Look, you can try to get rid of me but Im not walkin away from this Im sorry, I just dont want you to be the father of my child This is all your fault, yeah!
-  Go talk to her an-and-and do the right thing - Kelso, Im so sorry, I wish there was something I could do Well, there isnt Okay fine Ill give you ten seconds to squeeze my ass as long as you want I never thought Id say this but theres some things that a girls ass can't fix Well, Fez, congratulations on your green card, but remember this is America and you still look foreign so dont expect to be treated equally Well, Im going to become Americas sexiest singing cowboy Howdy ladies, meet Pepé!
You know, whats going on with Brooke really hurts but I think in a couple days when I start to heel, Im gonna be really psyched that Donna let me squeeze her ass.
I mean, even now Im reflecting upon on how soft it was So, what kind of chance do you think I have with the blonde?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
So get this, I got fired!
I'd never thought I'd say this but apparently I'm not good enough for the dog food factory.
I thought you'd say that.
Honey, don't worry we'll get along fine without your paycheck.
Instead of going to the movies, we'll watch TV.
Instead of eating popcorn, we'll lick salt.
It's like, why would Joanne fire me?
Bob she's your girlfriend, did she say anything?
Eric, ixnay on oanne-jay.
Donna, you know I don't understand Pig Latin.
Bob, what is Joanne's problem?
Eric, ixnay means shut up.
It's okay, honey.
I can talk about it.
Me and Joanne broke up.
And-- and I didn't see it coming.
Bob, what did I tell you last week?
Don't cry in your kitchen?
And I didn't mean just that day.
I meant always.
I better go then.
Nice going.
Ackass-jay Ackass-jay?
!
Oh Jackass!
Well, honey, I don't think you're a jackass.
I think you're a jack-angel.
Hey Mom, look, I know you're worried about money with Dad not being able to work.
But I want you to know, I'm gonna go right back out there and get a a better job, a high paying job.
Well sure, just go down to the Bureau of High Paying Jobs.
You can't miss it, it's right next to the Pie-in-the-Sky Office.
Jackass!
Oh really?
Thank you.
Well the job search is going great.
I think I have a shot at washing an old man's back on tuesdays and thursdays.
They were looking for a waiter down at the restaurant.
Whoa, why'd you tell him, I'm up for that job.
That's why I told him.
No, no, no.
Look, Eric, I need this job way more than you do.
You don't have a baby on the way.
But I do have a family to support.
And-- if I don't keep the booze flowing, they're going to get violent.
Well, look the only way Brooke's going to let me be a part of my kid's life is if I prove to her that I'm responsible.
A promotion at the restaurant would impress her.
And, I mean busboy is a job but waiter is a career.
Okay.
Well then, you know what.
We'll just both go down there, apply and may the best man win.
No, I want it.
Season 6 Episode 6 We're Not Gonna Take It Laurie!
Well look what the whore dragged in.
Herself.
Need I remind you that you are married.
Oh, that's okay.
The guy from last night was married too.
What is your problem?
Are you two at it again?
Your green card is on the way, I thought this marriage was over.
Laurie, I gave you $50 last week to go down to the court house and file for divorce.
What happened?
Well I had to get a new make up mirror and some wine.
Tomorrow we're going to the court house.
Hmm, the court house is across town.
I wonder if you can make it all the way there without sleeping with someone.
I bet I can make it there without sleeping with you.
Bitch!
Bob?
What are you doin' here, anyway?
Oh, it's just something I'm trying out.
How's it goin'?
It's a little uncomfortable.
I thought it'll be better than sitting home alone.
It's not.
Oh, my poor dad.
I wish there was something I can do to make him feel better.
Well, once when I was sad, when Michael was cheating on me I got flowers from a secret admirer, and it cheered me right up.
I mean, sure I send them to myself.
But it's the thought that counts.
Those flowers were from you?
You let me go on and on about how they were from me.
God, try a little honesty!
Wait.
That's actually not a bad idea.
If my dad thought somebody else likes him, he wouldn't be so bummed about Joanne.
But men don't really like flowers, do they?
No, they remind as of bees.
Oh, I'll send him fudge.
He loves fudge.
I know because one time he got some and I asked if I can have a piece, and he quickly changed the subject.
Well, let me tell them what to write in the card.
I'm good at that.
When I sent myself those flowers and read how much I love me, I felt so much better.
Hey, Roy, remember me?
I'm Eric Forman.
- Oh hey, how are you?
- I'm here to apply for the waiter position.
- Okay.
- Roy that's the guy I was telling you about.
Ohh Well, I don't think we can hire a waiter who's got a disease that spreads through food.
Roy, he really doesn't like to talk about his death-a-food-a-spreaditis.
Death-a-food-a-spread-a-what?
Who are you?
Elmer Fudd?
All right fine, he doesn't have a disease.
I just-- I really want the job, Roy.
Well I wish I could give it to both of you.
I mean Eric's got that Zippy personality and Kelso's old man.
I know what we should do.
We should make it a competition.
That way, there's the fun of someone losing.
Okay, everybody, let's put some smiles on those faces.
We're goin' to get divorced.
What the hell's this?
Looks like a box.
I know it's a box.
Hey, what's with the attitude?
I'm just making conversation looks like a box, it is a box.
This is how real people talk, man.
Oh, it's a present.
Ooh, it's a wedding present from Aunt Martha!
You told her about the marriage?
We agreed never to speak of this evil to anyone!
Well, I had to tell a few people because I never thought I'd be able to say "Laurie got married" without adding "and the baby came early".
Ooh, look at the paper sparkle!
I wonder what it is.
Well keep wondering 'cause this package is going right back.
- But Daddy!
- But Daddy!
No, no, I-- I'm just curious Aunt Martha's well to do.
So you have to figure, it's a pretty nice present.
Don't you want to just peek?
No, I want to go to the court house.
Now get moving.
Whatever's in this package might make you happy for a day, but a divorce is a gift that lasts a lifetime.
Guess what girls?
I got fudge.
Fudge?
What a surprise!
Who is it from?
It doesn't say.
But there's a poem.
"Roses are red Violets are blue Fudge is sweet Here's some fudge".
Wha-- they rushed me.
I wonder who it's from, 'cause it sounds like someone likes you.
I hope it's a lady.
Hello!
Oh, hi Joanne.
It's Joanne.
Really?
Well I think it's a little late to talk about getting back together it turns out, I'm very desirable.
So I think this is goodbye.
Oh, and I want my Barry White albums back and my body paints.
Oh my God!
I know they painted each other!
Ugh!
Eric, you're first.
I'm gonna test you on the skills every waiter should have.
Roy, I want you to know that because of my extensive background in crafts I can fold a napkin into a rose, a swan and the rarely seen, X-wing Fighter.
- Cool!
- I know.
Okay, I'm gonna place a difficult order and you'll relay it to Steven in the kitchen.
Here it goes.
Surf and turf, no seafood.
Meat, nice and pink.
Mashed potatoes, not mashed.
Sliced into wedges and fried up.
Okay, so steak, medium rare and french fries.
Okay I'm gonna need #4, still kickin', hold the guppy and send it to France.
And that is how you do that.
Surf and turf, no seafood.
Meat, nice and pink.
Mashed potatoes, not mashed.
Sliced into wedges and fried up.
One cheese burger.
It's very important that a waiter can deal with difficult costumers.
Steven and I are gonna play a married couple.
I'm not so into this Roy.
Excuse me waiter, uh, this wine is no good.
It's our anniversary and I want everything to be perfect.
God knows it's hard enough just to get him out of the house.
Well I'm very sorry madam if you'll allow me to bring you a complimentary bottle of our finest wine I'd be most obliged.
Most obliged?
That's Shakespeare.
Waiter!
Uh, it's our anniversary and this wine is no good.
Yeah, you got a lot more problems than the wine.
You are one ugly broad.
I do not appreciate your tone.
My tone?
Dude your wife's a bitch!
Okay.
Work your way around the tables with a tray full of dishes without spilling or dropping anything.
And for God's sake, watch out for the baby.
Go!
Ten bucks says his skinny little wrist snaps under the weight.
I'll take that bet.
He's scrawny, but strong.
Like the Vietcong.
So Like when does this test start?
All right.
Oh, what's this?
Roy, I think you might have left a 20 dollar bill tucked in my sleeve.
I'm always losing stuff.
But-- No Roy, that was And, go!
Well Eric, you're hired.
Oh really?
Roy, this is like a dream.
Uh A really mediocre dream.
All right everybody only twelve signatures to the end of what I like to call the shame.
Still there and it calls to me.
Like a box with something mysterious in it.
There's nothing like a present wrapped in beautiful paper.
It's like Cary Grant in a tuxedo.
I just want to rip it off.
Don't touch it!
I'm not I'm smelling it.
What does it smell like?
A box.
- I hope it's a sewing machine.
- I hope it's a TV.
I hope it's a a chocolate TV.
There could be perishables in there.
Oh my God!
What if it's a puppy?
We have to open it.
I don't care if Eric's in there.
It's going back.
Now, let's get this signed.
- Look right here, paper's ripped.
- Oh my gosh, you're right.
Hmm.
I see part of a word, moore and under that, something cro Moore Cro Moore Cro It's a Kenmoore Microwave!
I win!
I win!
Hey.
Hyde, where's table seven's fish?
Oh, I got that for you Eric.
Here is your Fillet of Sole.
Ohh Burn!
All right Eric, here's the pea soup you ordered.
You peed in this soup, didn't you?
No.
I'm done trying to screw you over.
All right bud.
It's not your fault you got the job some people are busboy, and some people are waiters.
And guess I'm just an extremely handsome busboy.
Roy that extremely handsome busboy just broke my heart.
I really don't think he'd peed in the soup, Eric.
Look, couldn't you find another waiter job for him?
He needs a break, he's got a baby on the way.
Well, there might be a job opening up 'cause Jeannie said she'd quit if I don't stop asking her out.
Come on, I'm not gonna stop asking her out.
So if I really work hard with Kelso will you give him another tryout?
Sure.
But I really don't think he can handle it and my standards for food service are really low.
I haven't washed my hands in four days.
- Dad-- - Too late, I finished it.
So, I was trying to figure out who sent me the fudge and I thought, it could be the lady at the pharmacy.
Which is nice because she's seen my prescriptions so we can skip that awkward conversation.
Or it could be the mail lady.
Dad, I have to tell you something.
Jackie and I sent you the fudge.
What?
Well you seemed so sad that we wanted to cheer you up.
But then we screwed your chance of getting back together with Joanne, so So nobody likes me.
We like you!
Eh We're really sorry, Dad.
I guess it's not so bad.
I mean I haven't thought about Joanne all day.
Well if you want we can all do something today.
I could take you to the model train shop.
Some of the tiny trees in Pinciotti Town are looking pretty ratty.
Nah, I'm gonna go down and talk to the girl at the pharmacy.
She's got a better keister than the mail lady.
You'd think with all that walkin' Hey, guess you either got it or you don't.
Guys, give it up.
I'm not gonna be able to do this.
Hey!
That's not the Kelso I know.
A lot of people said couldn't fit and who proved them wrong?
I did.
That's right!
And a lot of people said you couldn't make out with both of the Ziegler twins on the same night and who proved them wrong?
I did!
Oh, and I also brushed your mom's boob at a bake sale so actually it was a three-fer.
Exactly!
You are Michael Kelso.
Right?
You make the impossible happen.
Now come on.
Let's do this!
Okay.
Ready.
Get set.
Kelso!
What?
!
Good luck.
Ah!
What a beautiful morning!
The birds are singing.
The flowers are blooming.
Divorce is in the air.
Now, let's finish this.
Red, no one wants to get divorced on an empty stomach.
Ooh, and that's breakfast!
You used the microwave!
Red Forman, I firmly believe that God wants me to bake a potato in four minutes.
No, God wants these two divorced and all evidence of their unholy union out of this house.
We got another present.
No, no!
Don't open it 'cause we're not keeping it.
Whoa.
Look at that saw!
It's from Billy Schneider down at the hardware store.
He's had a crush on me since I went ladder shopping in that miniskirt.
Okay, just to make it clear.
If you're buying me a gift I want candy.
For my birthday, christmas, daylight savings-- candy.
Candy!
Now, you can have the saw, Red.
No.
I that would be, uh wrong.
Well.
It would be wrong if they were divorced.
But if they stayed married, sending the gifts back would be rude.
You make a good point!
But I want a divorce.
I'll tell you what, honey.
We'll wait a month.
If a riding mower hasn't shown up by then, we'll talk.
Okay, remember, buddy.
The tray is like a lady.
Dance with her.
And, go!
I did it!
Congratulations!
You got the job.
- Oh.
I can't wait to tell Brooke!
- Hey.
Welcome to the exclusive ranks of waiter at a crappy hotel restaurant.
I can't believe that I did it.
Yeah.
I can't believe the glue held.
Yeah.
Super Glue kicks ass!
You know what Kelso.
Your first shift is not gonna go well.
Oh, it's gonna be a disaster!
"Warning: Never put metal in the microwave" This isn't metal, it is soup.
Miss Kitty!
Eric broke the microwave!
Season 6 Episode 6 We're Not Gonna Take It
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}

Every insomniac and burn out in town is gonna know who I am.
Well say hello to your target audience.

You guys, I've got some terrible news.
I've just been kicked off the cheerleading squad.
- Oh my little Jesus!
- Oh no!
- Why?
Jackie I know how you feel, I once got kicked off a cheerleader.
Well I need to get back on that squad.
They might be a bunch of pom-pom waving bitches, but they're all I know.
Steven, you've gotta take me to the "Christmas Eve dance" tomorrow night.
Uh no.
I can either dance with, or spend Christmas Eve with you; cannot do a combo.
Steven, they will never take me back if I don't show up all proud.
If you could just seethat this is something that'sreally important to me thenyou'd understand that as my boyfriendyou should go.
Fine!
Please Fine!
Hey shut up, if I'm going, you guys are coming with me.
Oh no, cannot go to a high school dance!
I'm gonna be a father soon I gotta start acting more mature.
All right, orange!
Yeah, I'm not going either.
The football team and I have a little disagreement.
They think it's funny to stuff me into a locker, and I disagree!
Yeah man, the day I graduated, I promised myself I would never set foot in that God forsaken place again.
Great news, kids.
Red's gonna be the Santa down at the mall on Christmas Eve, and I've signed you all up to be his little helpers.
Oh, I'm sorry Mom, we're all going to the Christmas Eve dance at school.
That 70's show Season 6 Episode 7 Christmas Don't go away kids, "A Year Without A Santa Claus" will be right back.
Man, Heat Miser is badass.
So what time are you coming down the station tonight?
Let's see, the Christmas dance starts eight o'clock, so I'll just come as soon as it gets lame say uh 8:02.
Yeah.
Hey y'know what, I'll even bring you something sweet to munch on, oh and some cookies!
What?
Oh, What?
Okay now, please stand still.
Nobody likes a Santa with plumbers butt.
- Why am I doing this?
- Because I wanna force some good cheer through your clogged arteries and into your cranky heart.
Yeah, it's like Christmas Draino.
I can't believe you're replacing me as Santa, Red.
Three years and now management says I'm too jolly?
- What do you want, Bob?
- I want to be Santa!
Well, it's Red's turn this year.
Santa could use an elf.
Fine.
But I don't wanna sit in the back and pretend to assemble toys, I want to participate.
Yeah Bob, you gotta keep your dignity.
If you're in an elf costume, you don't want that tiny hammer making you look silly.
Steven, for the Christmas Eve dance What do you think about this tie Maybe this jacketHow about a blazer?
Fine!
Bolo?
- Fine - Ok!
Okay Brooke, I made a list of all the reasons why I'm gonna make a great dad for our little baby.
Okay number one, I am a waiter, so we'll never run out of straws.
See, look kids love straws Michel, look I really appreciate the gesture, but no thanks.
Seriously, I think if we just hang out, you'll see that I'm getting a lot more mature.
I mean, just the other day I watched golf, and took a nap.
Look Michael, if we weren't in this situation I think you'd be a really good friend.
I mean you're nice, you bring me stuff,dogs love you.
I just think we should limit our time together to almost none.
Alright, how about we make a compromise between 'almost none' and what I want to do, which is 'it'?
Okay, if you want, you can help me hang decorations tonight for the library's Christmas party.
Spend Christmas Eve in a library?
Why don't you just kick me in the 'nads?
Okay, here comes Julie, the head cheerleader.
Now, Steven make me look good.
- Hello Jackie.
- Hello Julie!
This is my boyfriend, Steven J. Hyde the third.
First two are in jail.
He pretends to be poor, isn't that funny?
I have to say, I thought you'd be too embarrassed to show your face here tonight.
Well to be honest, I only came to see your outfit so I'd know what not to wear.
Well, let me show you the back.
You're trying to get back on the cheerleading squad; shouldn't you be nice to her?
Bitchiness is the only language cheerleaders understand.
These are bad girls, they need to be punished, and they know it.
Yeah this is way better than hanging out at the library with Brooke.
Lotta great memories in here.
Did it in there did it back there got caught by Miss Tompkins doing it down there did it with Miss Tompkins over there.
Everyone look for football players, I cannot spend another holiday in a locker.
And this time if I don't show up for two days, come look for me.
Oh my God, Eric Forman?
You look great, I love your shirt.
Really?
I wore this shirt for four years, and no one said a thing.
I guess now you really fill it out.
Thanks.
I'm I'm like up to seventeen push-ups a night so No I don't think that's it.
I think it's because you're not a high school boy anymore.
Yeah, you're eighteen now.
You've seen and done it all.
No, no I yes, yes I have.
Yeah, that's true Hey, you need to watch out okay?
Girls are talking to you, I think there might be a practical joke in the works.
No man, I don't think so.
I think it's cause I graduated.
Hyde, am I cool now?
Well, you're cool like margarine is butter.
Close, but there's a little aftertaste.
You're in the middle of a Christmas Eve rock block on WFPP with me, Hot Donna.
That was bacon.
I recorded that myself earlier today.
Stay tuned for more Christmas classics with me, Hot Donna.
I'm sorry but that is just too cool.
Okay, Mr. Clause.
Let's hear your best Santa laugh.
You left out a 'ho', Red.
It's three ho's, did you even read the Santa manual?
Okay Red, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Just remember Santa is a cheerful, jolly fellow, who never calls a child dumbass.
So what do ya want for Christmas?
I want a slinky.
A slinky?
Oh you'll get sick of a slinky in a day.
I'm putting you down for flash cards.
Math - that's what you're getting for Christmas.
Next!
- I want a pony.
- Ponies die.
What you need is a good pair of boots.
Go on keep it moving.
I want a flying car.
I did too when I was your age, kid.
But then the future came and took my dreams away.
Just like it's gonna take yours.
Okay, okay little girl, y'know what?
I bet if you're extra good, you'll get your flying car one day.
Don't listen to her, it's a lie.
Bad Santa.
Yep, life after graduation sure is sweet.
Some days I wake up and I'm like "hey I'm having ice-cream for breakfast" And you know what, I do.
Wow, so what have you two been up to since graduation?
She talked to me, what do I do?
Yeah, I got a librarian pregnant.
Damn, good answer.
So, like Eric, what are your plans for the future?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna keep on keepin' on, y'know?
I'm thinking about buying a boat.
Okay, we're back and uh, if my boyfriend's listening you're late and I'm a little worried you're trapped in a snow drift or something.
So honey if you're cold, I'm with ya baby.
Okay so let's take some requests.
Hello, you're on the air.
Hi, I'd like to dedicate "He's the Greatest Dancer" by Sister Sledge, to Eric Forman, the coolest guy at the Christmas dance.
What?
He's still at the dance?
Sorry I have to go, he's telling us about his boat.
That sneaky bastard.
Uh, that sneaky bastard Santa Clause is on his way with a non-stop block of classic Christmas tunes.
And remember you're listening to WFPP with me, Hot Donna.
You hear that Eric Forman?
That's not bacon, that's your ass when I get a hold of you.
Hey, I brought you something sweet to munch on - oh and some cookies!
Oh man, I knew that was funny.
Man, I can't stop thinking about Brooke.
I mean, both you and me know that every girl in here wants me except for the couple of weirdo's that seem to want you but I don't care about any on them.
Look Kelso, are you sure you don't just have a crush on Brooke because she's a librarian, and you've seen some librarian layout in Playboy?
Eric, I'm sure that's part of it.
Whatever, I'm going to the library.
Whoa, that felt weird to say.
Steven you don't look like you're having a good time.
I'm not.
I know, but I need you to act like you are.
Just think about stuff you enjoy, like shoplifting or dirty jeans.
Jackie, how come you never to me you were dating an older man?
Well I guess I was just distracted by the life I lead outside of cheerleading, where I do fun and glamorous things, with my older, mysterious boyfriend.
That's true.
Why just last week, we sat on the couch and had a fight.
I'm jealous.
Ah this dance sucks.
None of the girls remember me, they all think I'm a waiter.
Hey, I got an idea how you can get these girls attention.
Oh boy, does it involve me hiding in the girl's bathroom?
- No!
- Okay, we'll try your way.
And that's what really happened in Vietnam!
- I don't understand!
- Neither do I, kid.
Neither do I. Okay little boy, time to say goodbye to Santa.
What's an ambush?
It's a pretty bush with yellow flowers.
Kitty I gotta tell ya, I'm good with kids I really taught him something.
Y'know I think I'm beginning to feel the Christmas sprit.
Well I'm glad Red, but let's try telling a Christmas story where nobody gets caught in a fire fight.
Bob what the hell are you doing?
You're depressing the kids, I'm Santa now.
Get out of my chair Bob, or you're gonna get a candy cane up your chimney.
I'm not moving.
Kitty hold my silly red hat.
You're right, I really am funny.
What do you think you're doing?
Eric you never showed up, I was worried about you.
Well I'm sorry, I guess I lost track of time, maybe it's because I am a God to these people.
Donna they like this shirt.
This is a horrible shirt.
I gave you that shirt.
I know, I love this shirt.
Eric I can't believe you let yourself get a swelled head just because a couple of high school kids think you're cool.
Excuse me, aren't you Hot Donna?
You were so awesome on the radio today.
You really think?
Wait, what's going on?
I think we're in for a treat.
Nice decorations.
I see you're using one of the better tasting glues.
What are you doing here?
Oh I just though instead of having a fun Christmas Eve somewhere else, I'd rather have a boring one here with you.
But we could have some fun.
Michael, I've told you before, just because you come to the library after hours, does not mean I'm gonna walk around topless.
But it's Christmas.
Oh here let me help you with the decorations.
Pregnant women should not be standing on their tip toes, cause the baby will come out all cross eyed.
Listen, if you think you're gonna get me interested in you by being cute and making me laugh well it's probably gonna work.
But if you screw this up, I'm gonna ruin your credit with thousands of dollars in library fines.
Fair enough.
Well what say we seal this newfound friendship with a round of topless ornament hanging?
Okay fine, whatever you wanna do topless!
This mall is only big enough for one Santa, Bob.
Tell ya what, you name 5 reindeer and I'll step down.
I can name 5 toes that are gonna be in your ass.
Oh for goodness sake, why don't we stop calling it Christmas and call it Assmas?
Fine, I'll go.
I only got worked up because Joanne's gone, Donna's working.
The only people I got at home are my two friends, Egg and Nog.
Alright fine.
You wanna be Santa, go ahead.
- Thanks Red Yeah it's all for the best, I've already eaten about 2 pounds of fake beard as it is.
There he is.
Santa's the one that told me communists hate God.
Gotta go Santa.
Merry Christmas, Bob.
Mrs. Clause needs a drink.
And then I push a button, and it sounds like bacon.
This is so awesome; we're like a celebrity couple.
- It's intoxicating.
- Donna it is a heady brew.
Hey let's go drink beer in front of some sophomores.
Come on.
Jackie, in light of you showing up tonight with your boyfriend, who by the way is totally cool, and a fox.
Big newsflash there.
I'd like to invite you to rejoin the cheer squad.
Really?
You know I don't think I wanna be a cheerleader anymore.
But we hugged and jumped.
Well I'm gonna have to take back that hug and jump with a pout and a shrug.
Are you telling me I came to this hell hole for nothing?
No, not for nothing, Steven.
I realised these girls aren't my friends anymore.
I learned something about myself.
Oh, well isn't that Okay, well if it makes you feel any better, I get to keep the uniform.
Yeah that helps.
You set me up, 'sing a song they'll all love you', well I'm gonna spend Christmas in a locker.
Oh crap, I'm still on the air!
Hmm.
Jigsaw puzzle.
baseball glove.
Barbie doll tea set.
- Wow, you're good at this.
- Yeah, I've had a little practice.
Ant farm.
It's a Lone Ranger cap gun set.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Gooood morning.
- Try good 13:30.
I'm just so worn out from carrying around all this tip money.
Here you go, mom.
Why don't you, kick up the thermostat couple deegres on me.
Well,thank you honey.
And you have been such a big help working yourself nearly to death.
I made you your special sandwich.
- Oooh, "the Eric McSweady".
It's a regular sandwich.
Hold the masculinity.
It's almost time for Red's doctors appointment.
I have to iron his underware.
No crust, check, extra jelly, check.
My mommy loves me.
Check.
Eric, wow you look beat.
- Yeah, I was working until like 1:00 last night.
- Oh, my poor baby.
I know something that will cheer you up.
Today, I got my first bridal magazine.
We can spend the whole afternoon talking about wedding stuff.
Like, the groomsmen can wear kilts.
Donna, you know how much I'd love to spend or clothes, or clothes for the wedding, but, God I'm so beat from last night.
Okay.
Why don't you go back to bad,and I'll crawl up with you after class, but this time sweep the bed for GI Joes, cause that last thing that happened that was unpleasant.
Life is a cabaret, my friend!
You didn't work untill 1:00.
We got off at 22:00 and played poker.
Hyde, let's not wear ourselves down with the truth here.
When I started working full time, I thought that my life was gonna be a total grind, but my mom, Donna, they can't do enaugh for me.
Look at this.
Heart shaped sandwiches.
Donna's giving me sexy naps.
As God is my witness I will never go hungry or horny again.
Will you please wear the ironed underware.
I have a reputation to protect.
Eric, you're driving me to my doctors appointment.
Please, put on pants.
Eric is a little tired from working so late, so I found someone else to drive you.
Jump in Smokey, Bandit's on the move.
Okay Brooke.
Here's the thing.
We should date.
- Michael, I'm pregnant with your child.
Pretty much the best and worst things about dating have allready happened to us.
Okay, but we missed out on all the in between.
Like.
Okay, we need to spice up our illegitimate pregnancy with a little romance.
I mean, look how much we have in common.
You are having my baby, and I am the father of your baby.
Okay look, don't pretend you wanna go out with me just because you feel guilty.
Brooke, I wanna go out with you cause you're hot.
Okay fine, but I'm not hot.
I've gain six pounds.
That's okay, cause it's mostly in your boobs.
See, nature does this to keep us guys around while you gals chunk out.
Okay, let's get couple of things straight.
I don't wanna be here, you don't wanna be here.
- I wan't to be here.
Fine.
I don't wanna be here, and I don't care what you want.
Okay then.
Are you buckled up?
- Yes.
Hmm, because the little blinking man on the dashboard says you aren't.
Buckle up.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
Look, start this car or I'm gonna pack you in the crate, take you down to the port and trade you for a year supply of bananas.
Hey.
- Hey.
- You awake?
Well, if I were asleep there'd be six of you all making out with yourselves.
Can't belive how late you must stay at the restaurant.
- Well, you know that grated cheese you like so much?
Gets grated the night before.
Yeah, little thing we like to call "prep", so.
- I love it when you use restourant talk.
Donna, I have to warn you, I'm exhausted.
So, you're gonna have to do all the work.
Why should today be any different?
I need to know what to do on a first date with a women who is carrying my child?
Hold her while she weeps.
Hey wait, what if you guys came to dinner with me and Brooke?
It would make easier to find stuff to talk about.
- No, no man, there is no way I'm going on a date with your ex girlfriend who is now my girlfiend, and your new girlfriend who doesn't wanna be your girlfriend, but is pregnant with your child.
It's like hillbilly territory.
I'll pay.
I'm in.
Well then i have to go find something to wear.
I mean i'm happy that Brooke's gonna have a father for her baby and all, but I still have to look prettier than her.
Well I was woken from my afternooon nap by my girlfriend for some afternoon delight, afterwhich i took another afternoon nap.
You know what i have right in the palm of my hand?
- No one wants to know that.
Just wash up.
The secret of life.
You know what?
I'm taking this one step further, fellas.
I'm gonna get fat.
Yeah, i'll never be strong, but i think i can be fat.
That's a pretty thought.
C'mon, Fez, don't be scared.
Go say "hi".
No, he's too fat.
I don't know where his face is.
He can't eat you.
He can't even move.
Watch!
That tickles.
Aaah, something's poking me.
GI Joe.
There you are.
What else is in there?
Kelso!
I thought you moved away!
- I've been living on crumbs!
Alright, okay.
Laugh all you want but all I see is a guy who doesn't have to go out of bed to go to the bathroom And that's beautiful.
Hey look there's the "Oaks Lodge".
Pull over.
But i thought we would celebrate your good checkup.
There's this pie down at the coffee shop I've been flirting with for days.
How about this for a celebration, I'm going in there with my budies and you wait in the car.
- But that does not sound like fun.
Well, that's how we celebrate in America.
Okay, let's head for home.
So now you're not gonna talk?
- Why should I talk?
My feelings are obviously of no consequence to you.
Alright, maybe I stayed a little longer then I expected.
Hey look, how about we stop for some pie?
- No.
Oh c'mon, let me get you a pie.
- I am not in the mood.
Oh just let me buy you a - There will be no pie!
Wow, good pot.
There's gotta be like 4 or 5 bucks in there.
Yeah you guys are going down.
I gotta a full house.
I mean What do I got?
Why don't you bet a lot and see.
Kelso, I know you think you got a full house, but you're only holding two cards.
So I'll raise.
This is great.
It's I'm not alone.
This is great.
Guys I don't wanna brag but my belt is getting pretty tight.
I think operation "Fat Eric" is well under way.
What the hell are you doing?
You told me you were working.
I brought you brownies because you told me you were working your ass off.
And now it turns out you were spending all the time, we could have spent together, with the guys.
And, I gave you daytime sex.
Alright.
Who brought brownies?
Is Eric upstairs?
- Just look for the lump under the cover sucking his thumb.
Hey, you gonna yell?
- No, I'm past yelling.
- What's past yelling?
It's the dark side of the moon, my friend.
The place so ugly if it was a women even you wouldn't have sex with her.
Ahh, that's bad.
How can you sleep untill noon after what happened last night?
I'm exhausted from loving you so much.
You're completely regressing.
You lie around all day and you act if you'd be happy to stay in your mothers house forever.
- Look Donna, let me make it up to you.
There's some tip money on the dresser.
Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty?
Don' worry, we can still hear!
Eric, what is happening to you?
- Look Donna, I'm sorry but I'm not regressing.
You gotta understand I'm the man of this house now.
Okay, who is ready for a Spidey and a sandwich?
- Me!
Mrs. Forman, your son is a big lazy chump because you keep babying him.
- I don't baby him.
Is there a crust on that sandwich?
Well of course not.
Crusts are icky they make Eric sicky.
Oh my God, I'm ruining him.
Eric, things are gonna change around here, drastically.
Tomarrow you are getting a sandwich whith crust on.
And no more crazy straws.
You will be drinking your chocolate milk from a standard straw.
Now, who's hungry?
- I call sandwich.
- I call Spidey.
I call sandwiches you haven't made yet.
Okay, Donna I get it, I'm sorry.
- No, that's not gonna cut it.
I've been wearing this engagement ring so long it's white under there, and a little wrinkly.
You haven't brought up the wedding in weeks.
I stayed home from college to be with you.
And if i knew you were gonna act like this, I would have gone.
- You right.
- I know.
Donna, I know that I'm lucky to be with you.
Hell, when we go out together, people think I'm your little brother.
That's true.
They say I shouldn't have you out so late.
You are right.
No, you are absolutely right.
I'm really, really sorry.
Okay?
So, are you still mad at me?
Well, it's kind of hard when you keep agreeing with me.
I agree.
- Stop it.
- You're beautiful.
- I will kick your ass.
So, maybe a good way to break the ice would be for everyone to tell a few things about themselves.
I'll go first I like makeup and diets, and Steven here likes black things and throwing stuff at glass.
Okay.
Well, I was valedictorian at my class, I ran marathons and I tutor kids in Latin.
Well, I egged the valedictorian of my class and a marathon runner.
Oh, and some kids that took Latin.
This is fun.
So, how do you guys all know eachother?
- Well, Michael and I dated for like 3 years.
Then I stole her from him.
- Wait what?
You never could have stolen from me if I hadn't cheated on her first.
Okay, wait a minute - That sounds a lot worse than what it is.
I only cheated on her with Erics sister.
Well, and then the rest of the girls when we were on a break cause I annoyed her, but none of those girls were anybodies sister.
Except for the two that were sisters.
He brought up the sisters.
Awsome.
Okay.
This was a mistake.
I think I'm gonna go.
- No, Brooke wait.
I've been with a lot of chicks, a lot a lot a lot.
Okay, that's not helping.
- Brooke, just let me start over, okay?
We might not be a perfect match, okay, but I really, really like you and I think us having this baby together is like faith.
Michael, faith is when two people meet on a train or in Paris, not in a bathroom at a Molly Hatchet concert.
Faith.
Man, never use a word in a fight if you don't really really knows what it means.
Still not speaking to me?
Fine, I'll speak.
I spent all day running your bold, grumpy ass around town.
And do I get a thanks?
No.
Because you're unpleasant.
You wanna know why I'm unpleasant?
I just had a heart attack, and now I have to be driven around like a useless dope by the idiot that marry my daughter and gave me the heart attack in the first place.
But I am also unpleasant because I just spent the entire day cooped up in the car, breathing that mustard gas that you call cologne.
But mostly I'm unpleasant because that's how it works in this family.
I'm family?
Oh crap.
Guys, everything is totally cool.
I've promised to stop acting like such an ass, and give Donna only presents, not cash.
Why is that?
- Because presents are for girlfriends and cash is for hookers.
Although - You're so good I should pay you.
- Thank you.
You should've seen it coming Forman.
Cause when you're deeply, trully happy, it's a sure sign you're doing everything wrong.
It's true.
Once Steven's unhappy, I know our relationship is in good shape.
Well, then we've been tip top since the minute i've meet you.
Yeah, I couldn't be unhappier about me and Brooke, so I know I'm doing the right thing.
Cause the misery is how God lets you know you're on track.
And how.
Red and I are miserable together, and that crazy bastard is nuts about me.
Donna,what are you doing the day after your birthday?
- Nursing a hangover.
You might wanna stick to light beer.
Cause I was thinking maybe we could get married that day.
Oh my God, are you setting a date?
You can't set a date in a circle.
I can and I did.
- I love you.
There's no groping in the circle!
We made that rule for Fez, but i goes for everyone!
Oh, c'mon Eric take charge, grab her like you mean it.
I'll do it.
Brooke?
Holly crap!
That's the girl you got pregnant?
She's hot!
Do you think we could talk alone for a minute?
Sure, I'll go.
But just know if it doesn't work out with him, I've got dental for all dependents.
- You're funny.
- I love you.
Goodbye.
I've got a things to do.
Look.
I don't know why what happened happened.
I mean it could've been faith, it could've been the Colt 45s, but I do know you're beeing very sweet, and I could probably use a hand, cause to tell you do truth I'm kind of scared.
That's perfect cause I'm terrified.
I know, I mean it's crazy.
- We're having a baby!
- I know!
And we have no clue!
- None at all!
So, can I call you tomarrow?
- Yes.
Before you go I just wanted to say, I don't love you.
I just kind of get nervous in front of women.
I blurr.
I understand and I think it's very sweet.
- I love you.
What is wrong with me?
Hi Roy.
- Hello Brooke.
Hi Roy.
- Hello Brooke.
HI, Roy.
- Hello, Brooke.
I got this.
Hi Roy.
- I love you.
Excuse me.
- Roy, that's the freezer.
- I know.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}

I'm in a mentor program for little girls, kinda of like a big sister thing.
And there's someone here who is very anxious to meet you.
Come here.
Isn't she cute?
I call her Little Jackie.
For the last freaking time, my name is Colette.
Try to like her, she's just a little mouthy.
Jackie, why would you be a big sister?
Oh, it's a community service project foe school.
It was either this or helping out at the senior center.
And you know how grey hair gives me nightmares.
Can I leave now?
There's nothing to do.
Here.
Take theese pictures of me and put them in order of cuteness.
From "very cute" to "it's just not fair she's so cute".
Lame, lamer, lamest.
I like her.
Yeah, me too.
- She's feisty.
Nice name tag.
Are you a garbage man?
It's a badge!
Get away from me.
- I bet that's the first time you told that to a man.
Don't you walk out that door!
What the hell was that all about?
- Oh, they've been fighting like that all morning.
Sometimes he even yells at her in his native language.
I belive the main idea is, she gets around.
Ahh, to be young and trapped in a lovely scheme of a marriage.
Kitty, where's the coffee?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I almost forgot.
Since no one fixed my sink yet, today instead of coffee we're having pipe sludge.
You know the doctor told me not to do household chores.
It's either a working sink or a dead husband, it's your choice.
Well Red somebody's gotta do something around here, the garage needs to be painted, the lawn mower won't start and I'm getting tired of running to the hose everytime I need bourbon and water.
Fine, fine we'll let Eric do it.
Maybe if I supervise him he'll only screw up half as much.
Yeah, thanks dad, you know what i got it.
Yeah, this from the kid who gets sweaty when he needs to change out toilet paper.
Don't you walk back in to that house!
Officer Kennedy, I want you to know even though it's my first ride along I'm not afraid to kill a man.
I just don't want to touch him after he's dead.
- Shut it cadet.

- I'll tell you what the problem is.
I am married to a whore.
I am not a whore.
I'm just a girl who likes a good time.
I'm sorry.
I can't imagine who would've called the police.
It's about time you showed up.
These two are making so much noise I couldn't enjoyed my programme.
Bob, you really had to call the police?
Sorry Kitty, but how am I suposed to name that tune if I can't even hear the notes?
Okay.
Well, this kid seems to be harmless but since you're training why don't you frisk him anyway.
Oh sure, frisk the foreign guy.
The color of my skin is not a crime.
Why do you have a frog in your pocket?
It's a suprise for the ladies.
Oh, he pied on me, that's resisting arrest.
Well, I'm about to resist arest too.
Hey dad, that was pretty cool how i shut off all the water in the house.
Yeah, you really installed a lot of condfidence, muttering lefty-lucy, righty-tighty the whole time.
Okay, lets get started.
Now this is a wrench.
Dad i think I know what tools are.
- Good.
Then grab the phillips head.
Shoudn't I buy Phillip a drink first?
C'mon were just a couple of guys having some fun on a job.
Lighten up.
Get a little, lefty-lucy.
Do you even know what a phillips head screwdriver is?
I know it's a screwdriver.
Now.
The water's off.
- Why is the water off?
- We're gonna fix the pipes.
But I have to use the bathroom.
- What?
I have to use the bathroom!
Well go ahead.
But you only get one flush so make it count.
Well I guess I can hold it.
I just hope I don't sneeze.
Would you sit still.
- Jackie, she's not a doll.
Well not a good one anyway.
I don't want a makeover.
You're suppose to be helping me with my homework.
Homework is for ugly girls.
Okay.
Pretty girls get geeky boys to do their homework for them.
Jackie, you're supposed to do fun stuff like go roller-skating.
Not teach her to prostitute herself for geometry notes.
She's cool.
Why can't she be my big sister?
See, Donna already has a little sister.
Her name is Eric.
Okay.
Get under the sink and loosen that disposal so we can get to the pipes.
Under there?
But, it's all spidery.
Get under there or you gonna get a spider the size of my foot in your ass.
I just realized something.
After all the years me helping you fix stuff you finally have to hold flashlight for me.
Lower dumbass.
Alright, I'm in.
I'm just gonna loosen Spider, big one.
Oh my god.
A brillo pad?
You were afraid of a brillo pad?
It bit me.
Boy, somewhere down the line I failed with you.
You know, I think it was that one day when you were ten and I cought you with those dolls.
They were action figures.
I wanna go to the movies.
Why?
You're watching me live my life.
It's better than any movie.
Good afternoon, civilians.
Where's my frog you son of a bitch?
Well the good news is I let him loose.
The bad news is he hopped in front of an eighteen wheeler.
He dodged the first wheel, but the last seventeen got him.
Did you show up in a cop car?
My training officer let me take the cruiser out for a spin.
Mind if we check it out?
- Fine, just don't touch anything.
I'll be in the bathroom taking care of some police business, or as the boys down at the station like to say I'll be taking the 10100.
How'd you like to see a police car?
- I already saw one when the police took my daddy to jail.
Alright, you know what, cheer up or you're not getting lunch.
Oh, Donna don't worry, you're getting lunch.
Okay, you know what.
You don't have a clue when it comes deeling with kids.
Well if you think you're so good at it, why don't you give it a shot?
Okay, I will.
C'mon, Colette, you've just been upgraded to Little Donna.
You know what.
It is your lose cause I was gonna let you give me a pedicure.
I can't belive they trusted Kelso with a cop car.
I can't belive he left the keys in it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Burn rubber, little buddy.
You're out of soap in the mens room.
My eagle eye catches everything.
This is so exciting.
What should we do next?
Plant some evidence?
Bust some prostitutes?
Plant some evidence in the bust of some prostitutes?
Oh hey, check it out.
Walkie talkie.
Freeze, you're under arrest.
Freeze, you're under arrest.
Freeze, you're under arrest.
Oh yeah, that's the one.
This is officer Michael Kelso.
And I'm not wearing any pants.
Am I supposed to be driving all over the road?
Cause I'm loaded .
My car is gone.
Somebody call the police.
Okay that's it.
I can't fix it.
I just, I can't do it.
Oh, what's the problem now?
Did the fuzzy dish towel jumped out and attack you?
I can belive you said you said you failed with me.
Oh, c'mon that was a joke.
You know like a "priest and a rabin walk in to a bar" or "I've failed with you".
Do you really think that?
- No, not completely.
I mean, maybe you're not good at fixing stuff but you stayed behind from school to help the family out.
And that's admirable.
Yeah, yeah it is.
Some might say it's the greatest gift a son can give his father.
No, the greatest gift a son could give his father is a Heisman trophy.
Look, you've tortured yourself enough for one day, lets just pack it up and call the plumer.
No, no.
Look I can fix some things.
Boba Fetts jet pack doesn't just glue itself back on.
You know what, I'm gonna fix lawn mower.
Right now.
No, why would you wanna embarass yourself like that?
I mean, I'll be standing there, and you'll be standing there and the mower won't work and I'll say something mean and claim it's a joke.
I'm gonna fix that lawn mower.
I'm gonna fix the hell out of it And when I'm done, you're be able to race that baby at the Indy 500.
Look son, just so you know, the lawn mower is the red thing with wheels on it.
Yeah, well not for long.
More news after this.
You know if a white man has stolen that car it would be all over that news.
Fez, not having every cop in Wisconsin looking for us is probably a good thing.
Shut up, whitey.
Has anyone seen Little Jackie?
- No, why?
Ahh, never mind.
Oh my god, you lost Little Jackie?
No, I didn't loose Little Jackie!
We're playing hide and seek, and she's really, relly good.
Oh, so you look for her, but when you play with Fez you let him sit in a closet all day.
I can not belive you Donna, you said I didn't know what I was doing, and look at what you did.
Okay, are you gonna help me find her or not?
- Well I'm gonna have to.
I mean this is serious.
If we don't find that little girl, I'm gonna get like half hour detention.
Where is my cop car?
You know what, I'm gonna count to three, and before I'm done you better tell me where it is.
One, two two and a half Three.
No, you can't say three.
That's not how it works.
Did my frog know how it worked when he seen that tire coming?
His tiny green life flashing before his eyes.
Guys c'mon.
You can't just take somebodies car without asking permission especialy since I kind of took it without asking permission.
What?
- You stole it?
I was supposed to be watching it while my training officer got a hair cut.
They are gonna have my paper badge for this.
Mom, dad come quick, I fixed it.
I fixed it.
It was like God had control over my hands.
Let me start it for you.
- Eric don't.
I've seen you use a wrench.
If you went lefty-lucy instead of righty- tighty we could all die.
Let me just put this in a garage.
But dad No,no honey, honey your father's right.
It's not safe.
We'll let Bob start it later.
What did you do?
Why?
Why, why is it always my house?
You really wanna now or you wanna just keep yelling?
- I wanna keep yelling.
I don't care whos fault it is, just get that thing out of here.
Now!
- Yes sir.
Alright everybody show's over.
Let's go in the house.
Dad, the lawn mower, I fixed the lawn mower.
You gotta see.
Kelso, wait Hey look Fez, just like your frog.
Oh well, it was broken anyway.
No, it wasn't.
I fixed it.
Mom, you belive me, don't you?
- Of course I do honey.
I belive that you belive you fixed it.
Why are you on my seat?
- This automobile has not moved.
Wait, you didn't ask me that.
Did you touch anything?
Cause if you did, you are in big trouble.
No, I can assure you, everything is exactly as you left it.
Hey Kelso, did you get the cop car back before you boss found out you stole it?
Okay, that I can explain that.
Where am I?
Yeah, I can't explain that.
Socket wrench.
Drives the spaceship, sits next to the hairy guy.
Han Solo.
Flathead screwdriver.
Oh, I know this.
Guy with the breathing problem.
Guy with the breathing problem?
This is Darth freaking Vader.
Seriously dad if you don't know the dark lord of the Sith, the most hated enemy of the jedi warrior then I guess somewhere down the line I failed with you.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Guys, there are actual stewardesses out there, and one of them talked to me.
I made this joke about how they just flew in And their arms must be tired.
Yeah, great.
Kelso, their neckerchiefs are undone.
You can see their necks.
Look, I don't have time for stewardess neck.
I gotta study.
They're really riding me down at the police academy and I don't know why.
I know why.
It's fun.
They even chose me last to work on the c.P.R. Dummy, so everybody's spit was all over it.
Yo, even Johnson's spit, and he's got a monster cold sore.
I know why they're doing that.
I bet you're the stooge.
What?
Every year the police academy lets one guy in they know will fail out.
They use him to scare the other cadets.
I know 'cause my brother was a stooge.
All right, fine.
It was me.
Oh, man, I'm the stooge!
Hey, come on.
Kelso, if that were true, you'd have had to have been a screw-up your whole life.
I mean, sure, you've fallen off the water tower Every year since junior high.
And you broke your arm wrestling a dog.
And, heck, no one's eaten more change than you.
All right, I gotta say, you guys are making a pretty good case that I'm the stooge!
Well, if you're not, there's a guy who's about to step on a rake that I really want to meet.
Hello, Wisconsin!
I can't believe I'm the stooge!
Michael, it's just the way some people are, okay?
Some people are lazy.
Some people are clumsy.
Some people are stooges.
You're lucky enough to be all three.
Kelso, keep in mind you're being called a stooge by a stooge while a third stooge sits idly by.
Compliment accepted.
Now, listen, you nincompoops.
These pies are for some very important clients.
Nothing should happen to these pies.
Got that?
Sure thing, boss.
Nice going, you knucklehead.
Now we gotta wash 'em.
Want to give me a hand?
Bravo!
Bravo!
Ah, so we got a wise guy, huh?
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!
Oh, yeah?
Take this!
How's it going with those Pies?
Ugh.
The three stooges have such bad hair.
You know, I wish I could go back in time for just 10 minutes and hand out combs and brushes.
Guys, can we focus here?
I gotta figure out if I'm the stooge or not.
Well, why don't you just, like, ask your Captain or something?
He won't tell me.
That's the whole point.
I gotta get a look at my file, which means I gotta break into the police academy.
Okay, you see how you took something that made sense and then made it weird?
That's part of the problem.
That's what I like about you, kelso.
You can make a mess out of anything.
I'm in.
Yeah, well, not me.
Breaking into a place where they train people to shoot you if you break into a place Come on, Eric.
We're a team.
Yeah, Michael's the looks.
Steven's the brain.
And you, your house has food.
Hey, remember when we shoplifted those baseball cards?
We were 12 years old.
And I didn't shoplift anything.
That's right.
You went home and told your mommy.
You mama's boy.
Well, did you want that on your permanent record?
Yeah, I didn't think so, mister.
Oh, God, I am a mama's boy.
I'm in.
Now, the secret to really good Fudge is a tiny bit of Kahlua.
You must make a lot of Fudge, 'cause the bottle's almost empty.
Well, it's a tiny bit of Kahlua for the Fudge, a tiny bit for the chef.
Ha ha ha ha!
That's how you make cooking fun.
Apparently, it also works for sewing and laundry and sitting around watching tv.
Okay, the I.N.S. Called.
I have to go in for a final review before I can pick up my green card.
I bet they give you a test on U.S. history.
See, America is strict about who we let in here 'cause we have stuff that people want to steal.
Unlike your lesser countries, like Canada and France.
See?
This is when a Bobby pin comes in handy.
Why do you have a Bobby pin?
I'm training my hair, okay?
I want more wave, less fluff.
Guys, this is serious.
Let's just find my file and get out of here.
Hey, what's in here?
It's the k-9 training room.
It's where they keep all the samples to teach the police dogs what to sniff for.
Oh, man, these samples are way better than our samples.
Did you see how quickly I sniffed them out?
I could so be a police dog.
Cool.
Training collar.
You know, I still don't get how they could think I'm a stooge.
I'm, like, so on top of everything.
What's this thing do?
Oh!
Give me that, kelso!
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Quit it, Hyde.
That really hurts.
Okay, do it one more time.
Okay, so this is George Washington, the father of our country.
Well, George and I have one thing in common.
We both look good in a powdered white wig.
Okay, so, fez, the statue of liberty was a gift from the French.
The French?
I didn't know that.
You didn't know that?
I really don't think it's common knowledge.
Okay, I painted my nails through two semesters of American history, and even I knew that.
Well, don't I feel like the hillbilly who wandered into town.
Well, it's no big deal, Mrs. Forman.
Oh, I see.
It's no big deal for you smart people who know everything.
But for us hillbillies, well, we're lucky if we know how to tie our shoes and flush the toilet.
Okay, Mrs. Forman, please don't get upset.
Okay, here.
Drink some more Fudge.
Okay, so The constitution was ratified Oh, I know this.
Oh, you're thinking of the declaration of independence.
See, the constitution was I know what the constitution is.
Can you make Fudge?
What?
Then can it.
Okay, what if they ask me about current events?
Tell me about Vietnam.
Okay, so Vietnam was an illegal war which we lost.
What the hell are you teaching him?
You, come with me.
I'll teach you the real American history.
First of all, we didn't lose the war.
It was a tie.
Besides, they're grateful.
They have McDonald's now.
Here's my file.
It doesn't say "stooge" anywhere.
Oh, good picture, but that's no shocker.
But this is Aah!
I think the batteries are starting to go.
That one didn't hurt as much.
You better let me hold on to this file.
I don't leave any fingerprints, thanks to my cool new black gloves.
Man, if only these shot webs.
Aren't those your mom's isotoners?
All right, guys, I gotta figure out if I'm in trouble or not.
What the hell is going on in here?
I'm gonna go with you're in trouble.
Cadet kelso, do you know what the penalty is for breaking into the academy office?
No, sir, officer Kennedy, sir!
There are none, because nobody's been stupid enough to do it!
All right!
You're first in your class.
Is that a dog training collar around your neck?
Oh, um, you're probably gonna want this.
It's the red button.
Look, sir, I think you should know that at the last police charity auction, my family bought one of your Christmas tree ornaments Santa driving a cop car.
Funniest thing on the tree.
It was.
Anyway, please don't call my mom and dad.
Thanks.
What's your name?
They call me fez.
Officer Kennedy, sir, I broke in to find out if I was the stooge or not, sir.
You're not the stooge.
Johnson's the stooge.
Yes.
But you're the stooge now.
Okay, I think that we've been reviewing long enough.
Let's see what you've learned.
I'll start you off with an easy one.
Where do you live?
Ame-dee-ca.
It's pronounced America.
That's what I said.
Ame-dee-ca.
America!
Ame-dee-ca.
Why do we celebrate the 4th of July?
Because we are damn glad not to be a bunch of British tea-drinking nancy-pants.
Nobody's gonna argue with that answer.
A-mer-I-ca!
A-me-dee-ca!
America!
Ame-dee-ca!
What was president Dwight d. Eisenhower's greatest achievement?
He led the allies to victory in world war ii and sent those jackbooted Nazi bastards home to cry in their Sauerkraut.
I didn't understand a word you said, but I heard "nazi bastards," and that's good enough for me.
America!
Ame-dee-ca!
Look, there is no damn "d" in "america"!
Say my son's name.
Eric.
Great.
Now America.
Ame-dee-ca.
Just forget it.
Just say "united States".
United States Of ame-dee-ca.
Guys, I'm really screwed down at the police academy.
Officer Kennedy told me he's looking for any reason to kick me out.
Okay, but did he say anything about calling my parents?
I was so freaked out that I completely blew this exam this morning.
I'm sure you did fine.
Roy, the first question was "stop in the name of the blank".
And I wrote "love".
God!
I don't care what they say, kelso.
Love is always the right answer.
So you screwed up a test, man.
You know what you have to do.
Yeah, yeah, study more next time.
What are you, Forman?
You gotta break in there and change the answers.
I can't break in there again.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
That's why they'll never expect it, man.
Look, they don't know you got a friend like me to talk you into doing something so fundamentally moronic.
That's true.
You know what?
I'm in, too.
I know it's dangerous, but I just really like wearing that outfit.
Trust me, it'll work.
How do you think I got through chemistry?
Hey, you told me you blackmailed the teacher 'cause you caught him smoking up behind the gym.
Oh, yeah.
How do you think I got through biology?
Fez, relax.
You're gonna pass the test.
No, this could be my last day in the country.
We should probably make love.
What?
Don't worry.
It'll be over before you know it.
So, on the way back from the bathroom, I got proposed to 3 times.
I must look more gorgeous than usual.
Jackie, the only reason they want to marry you is so they can stay in the country.
Jealous.
Okay.
Here I go.
I'm here for my test.
Where do I sign in, or should I say, where do I put my John hancock?
Actually, I will sign my name.
That's just a common expression.
I know so much history, I just drop it into everyday conversation.
There is no test.
I just need to see that you are who you say you are and that you're in the country to be with your wife Laurie Forman.
No test?
So that's it?
I'm truly really a citizen of this great country?
Just as soon as I stamp this paper.
Oh, this is great.
You and I should go celebrate.
Let's start out with a couple of drinks and some lovemaking and see where it goes from there.
I don't date married men.
Well, let's just say that as soon as I get my green card, I will be single.
Then you can explore the country of fez.
Hold on.
Are you telling me your marriage is a sham?
I'm telling you your eyes are like Amber waves of grain.
You do realize I haven't stamped this yet.
Actually, I had not.
Oh, he looks happy.
Yeah, I bet he's doing great.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you stamp my paper now?
I don't think so.
In a minute?
Nope.
After lunch?
Unh-unh.
Would you like me to stamp it?
Red, do you think I'm smart?
Oh, is that what we're gonna do today, we're gonna fight?
Great news.
I got my green card.
I am now officially a yankee doodle dandy.
So you passed the test, huh?
No, there was no test.
No test?
Oh, we're just as bad as Canada.
So, what happened?
Well, you know how sometimes I come on a little strong to the ladies?
You can be a little handsy.
It was touch-and-go for a while, but eventually, I won the I.N.S. Lady over with my charm.
More like you cried until she felt bad and stamped your papers.
Hey, tomato, potato- - it's all the same thing.
Bottom line is I have cha-dees-ma.
Charisma!
Yes, cha-dees-ma.
Man, I love these gloves.
I wish there was some diamond protected by lasers I could steal.
Okay, I'm almost done.
I just gotta think of one more misdemeanor.
Oh, breaking into the police academy.
All right, come on.
Let's go.
How do you keep finding us?
!
I'm wearing all black!
I sleep right next door.
What's the problem, trouble with the wife?
Shut up.
That's it.
You're outta here.
Wait.
I can explain.
Okay, this whole thing started because I just I can't be the stooge.
Okay?
I'm gonna be a dad soon, and no kid is gonna look up to his dad if his dad is the stooge.
Well, unless the kid's a stooge, in which case I wouldn't love him anyway.
You're gonna be a father?
Who would breed with you?
!
One night stand, both a little drunk.
Look, I know I messed up.
But can't you just maybe Give me one more chance?
All right.
Since you're gonna be a father, I'm gonna let what happened here slide.
But just so you don't do this again, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
There is no stooge.
What?
That's just a rumor we started to get the cadets to work harder.
Also there's no alligator in the lake.
Wait, wait, wait.
If there's no stooge, then how come our friend Roy told us he got kicked out of the academy for being a stooge?
Roy keene?
He didn't get kicked out for being a stooge.
He got kicked out for shooting the police horse.
Look, cadet, all you have to do is work hard and you'll be fine.
Now you clean up this mess and get outta here.
Well, I think we all learned an important lesson here.
If you're in trouble and your back's up against the wall, just tell 'em you got a kid.
People are suckers for a baby.
That is a valuable lesson.
I think we should all reflect on that In the k-9 training room.
I call shock caller.
I call buttons.
Okay, miss smarty-pants.
How about ooh.
Where was the famous tea party?
Boston.
Nope.
What?
Got it wrong.
Sorry.
It's the Boston tea party.
No.
It says right here it's " the Boston tea party".
Oh.
Huh.
I'm gonna have a long island tea party.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
So, guys, guess what.
I found the perfect place for me and Eric to get married.
Where, Donna?
Please tell us.
Okay, well that place up by the lake that overlooks the entire valley Where people go for romance.
You mean mount Hump?
People don't go there for the romance, Donna.
They go there for the humping.
Eric, let's go up there tomorrow and check it out.
I know the cruiser's in the shop, but we could take my dad's car.
Donna, he's got that "honk if you're horny" bumper sticker.
Yeah, well, I'd scrape it off, but "I brake for boobies" is underneath it.
Why are you guys all in Steven's room?
Well, Hyde was here, so I came in because I'm not comfortable enough with myself to be alone.
Yeah, but it's all gray, like a prison cell.
Gray is why prisoners are unhappy.
Really?
I always thought it was the loss of freedom And the uninvited man love.
Steven, I just think that you would be happier if you saw pretty things.
Like when I look at myself in the mirror, I'm happy.
When I look at you, I'm happy too, but when you talk, eh Hey, Eric, I have to ask you a very important question.
Can I borrow your G.I. Joe for a little experiment?
No.
I thought you were gonna say "yes".
And by the way, the experiment was a success.
G.I. Joe melts faster than cheese.
Kelso, you can't just take my things without asking permission.
Come on, we're friends.
I figure what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine.
What's Donna's is mine, too.
Kelso!
Yeah, Barbie didn't make it, either.
No one likes to see civilian casualties.
Ã¢ÂÂª That's weird.
My finger's due back tomorrow, but my hand's due back next week.
You know, Michael, I was a little worried about starting to date you, but lately, you've really impressed me.
Well, that's the police motto To serve and impress.
I thought it was "serve and protect".
They just changed it.
Maybe you could take me to my doctor's appointment tomorrow.
We'll hear the baby's heartbeat.
Seriously?
You want me to do baby stuff with you?
Yeah, you've been really great these last few weeks.
Yes, I have.
And there's no telling what you'll do next.
One day you might even read one of these things.
Yeah, let's just pray to God that day never comes.
Stupid Kelso.
Guess what I packed.
I'm gonna have to go with picnic.
You win.
So when do I get my car back?
I don't know.
We're scouting places to have the wedding.
You don't need to scout anywhere but the inside of a church.
What better place to start a happy life than our lady of perpetual sorrow?
Well, dad, the thing is we're not getting married in a church.
But we are thinking about getting married at mount Hump, which is sort of the church of humping.
Well, no church, no car, just like it says in the bible.
Well, the bible doesn't say anything about taking Kelso's van.
Donna, we can't just take it.
Of course we can.
What's his is yours, remember?
Do it for the liquefied face of g.I. Joe.
I can't think of a more fitting way to honor the real American hero.
Ã¢ÂÂª You're welcome, big guy.
What's this for?
No reason.
I was just thinking about you And how we've been through a lot together.
No, we haven't.
Oh, he gave you shoes.
What do you say, Red?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Or we say, "thank you very much".
Don't you think it's a little odd for a man to give another man a pair of shoes?
I saw 'em.
I thought they'd go nice with your tan pants.
Quit thinking about my pants!
My legs and what covers them is my business.
He's very sensitive about his legs.
You know, he shouldn't be.
They're shapely, like a lady dancer.
Maybe that's why he's so sensitive.
Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, finally.
I've been waiting all afternoon.
I'm about to burst!
Hey, man.
Thinking maybe you should wait out here.
No, no, no, Fez.
You should see this.
It's a dream come true.
Surprise!
Jackie, what the hell happened to my room?
I redecorated it.
Now if a stranger comes in here, he'd never know you were poor.
Looks like something for a girl.
I like it.
Or Fez.
I can't live like this.
I'm getting sick just looking at it.
Yes, yes, Steven, that sick feeling is your orphan soul coming alive.
Jackie, just put it all back, okay?
Make it ugly and dirty like I like it.
Well, excuse me for spending all morning putting up twinkle lights that are breathtaking, pillows as soft as marshmallows and scented candles that make you feel like you're running through a field like Laura freakin' ingalls!
Okay, okay.
We came here for a reason.
Now should I start and you watch, or should you start and I watch?
Either way, I'll be done first.
Ã¢ÂÂª So I told Hyde he could watch while Jackie and I do it.
And then he beat my ass with a twinkle light.
Where's my van?
Now I parked it right here!
Calm down.
You probably just lost it again.
Where was the last place you had it?
Right here!
Somebody stole my van!
That's horrible!
I left a brand-new bag of tootsie rolls in there.
Fez!
Okay, okay, it was just half a bag.
But if you talk to the insurance company, just tell them it was a whole bag.
I finally got Brooke to trust me, and if I don't take her to this doctor's appointment, I'm dead.
What am I gonna do?
Don't beat yourself up.
It's only tootsie rolls.
Look, I'm gonna take Red's car.
I know he's got a hide-a-key in there somewhere.
Are you brain-damaged?
Fez, did you just say, "are you brain-damaged"?
and sound exactly like Red?
Kelso, you know I only do Johnny Carson and Pepe le Pew.
Get away from my car.
Your car, my car.
Aren't we all just driving the same car?
It's a car called life.
How about I drive my foot into this thing called your ass?
A simple "no" would suffice.
Ã¢ÂÂª Shoes are an inappropriate gift to give another man.
Well, what about when you joined the service?
Another man issued you your boots.
But then he gave me a gun, so I let it go.
Well, why don't you just accept the shoes because Bob is your friend?
You don't understand how men work.
We don't give each other presents.
We pretty much ignore each other until someone scores a touchdown.
You should listen to me.
I know how to be a friend, and you obviously don't, since you don't have any.
I have plenty of friends.
Charlie's a friend.
He saved my life during the war.
And when is the last time you talked to Charlie?
We said all we needed to say on the boat back home.
Ã¢ÂÂª I don't believe this.
This is crazy.
not bad.
Ã¢ÂÂª feels so good Ã¢ÂÂª Nice.
Ã¢ÂÂª lying here next to me Ã¢ÂÂª It's so soft.
So smooth.
Ahh.
Ã¢ÂÂª my hands just won't keep still Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, yeah!
Isn't this amazing?
It is called mount hump because people come here to hump?
Or do people come here to hump Because it's called mount hump?
It's like the chicken or the egg.
Well, I have a really good feeling about this place.
Donna, there are panties in the grass.
Well, fez collects panties.
So we could just set him loose up here Before the ceremony.
So quiet and peaceful.
Can't hear anything.
Actually, I hear a car.
Oh, man, some poor sucker Just totally got into an accident.
Ã¢ÂÂª  Your chariot has arrived, my lady.
What happened to your van?
A little problem with the van.
I can't find it.
Michael, people lose keys to a van, Not the whole van.
Now I'm gonna miss my doctor's appointment.
Look, brooke, this is not my fault.
You're right.
It's my fault for depending on you.
Okay, I can fix this.
Just hop on the handlebars and I'll pedal you there.
Hello!
I'm pregnant!
Okay, fine.
You pedal and I'll ride.
Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, look.
Here you are with all your friends.
You claim to have all these friends.
Here are last year's christmas cards.
Kitty, a card from the jose cuervo collector's club Doesn't count.
Fine.
I can afford to throw this one away Because I have 55 more.
I will keep this because it has a coupon in it.
Anyway, it doesn't matter Because I'm keeping the shoes.
A good shoe is a good shoe no matter where it comes from.
Oh, it's like I'm walking on a pile of baby ducks.
Well, hello there, Senor fancy sheets.
I love the way jackie decorated your room.
It's all glittery, like-- Like an italian person lives there.
You let your girlfriend decorate your room?
She also buy you a new dress?
Yeah, I guess I have a lot to answer for.
Then again, I never accepted a pair of shoes From another man.
I knew it was a weird gift!
Kitty said it wasn't.
They're nice.
Steven, tell him they're nice.
Nah, can't do it.
But you know what?
Maybe she's right.
Maybe you should keep the shoes And give bob a present in return, Like a necklace or some sexy lingerie.
Ã¢ÂÂª Man, poor kelso's van.
When it finally landed, It didn't so much crash as completely separate Into its basic elements and just return to nature.
It was so sad.
There were tootsie rolls everywhere.
Yes, took a nap in my room.
My goose down duvet is like a cocoon.
I laid down a caterpillar and woke up a butterfly.
Maybe you with your room and red with his shoes Should get a room And decorate it with red's shoes.
Ha!
Burn!
Man, you just don't understand what it's like To have a bed that hugs you like you're a little baby.
It's like crawling into a mommy kangaroo.
I miss my kangaroo.
Remember when I said that he should decorate his room With red's shoes?
Ha!
Burn!
Hyde's in trouble!
She took it all down.
Did you just scream like a girl?
No.
What happened to my lavender-scented candle?
Did you just say, "what happened to my lavender-scented candle"?
No.
Ã¢ÂÂª Thank you.
Oh, okay, so I made appointments With all the doctors in your address book 'cause I don't know which one was the woo-woo doctor.
You know what?
Stay out of my stuff.
I'll take care of things myself 'cause you obviously aren't responsible enough to handle it.
Oh, kelso, you're here.
Um, hey, can I borrow your van For a little experiment?
No.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna say "yes".
Oh, my god.
Is that my steering wheel?
It's the biggest piece I could find.
Listen, kelso, I am so sorry.
I took the van to mount hump, And I forgot to set the parking brake.
I'm just really sorry.
The horn doesn't honk anymore.
Look, you know, at first, it seemed okay Because you melted my g.I. Joe.
But I mean, it's not as bad as destroying a van, so I don't know why I just said that.
I don't know what to say.
Well, I do.
You know, I called michael irresponsible, But he's not.
You are.
You're an irresponsible, twitchy little man!
Okay, please, just don't bump me With that thing.
Wait.
If he's irresponsible, That means I'm the good one.
I'm the good one now!
Yeah, he's obviously the dumb one of your group.
Hey, he really is.
Ã¢ÂÂª Red forman, don't you dare Throw those shoes away.
I just can't keep 'em, kitty.
Every time I wear them, I'll feel bob touching my feet.
Are you throwing away my shoes?
No, no, no, no.
He is not throwing away your shoes.
He is getting rid of that pesky new shoe smell By rubbing old food on them.
I'm throwing them away, bob.
Look, I appreciate the thought.
No, well, that's not true.
I mean Shoes are a weird gift to give another man.
I mean, what's next?
A weekend in cancun?
Okay, fine.
I bought the shoes for myself, But they pinched my toes, So I decided to pawn 'emff on you as a gift.
You were just trying to screw me over?
Well, I can respect that.
Thanks for the shoes, bob.
See, I have a friend.
No, no.
This is not the way friends act.
He was gonna throw away your present, bob.
Come on, kitty.
I gave him shoes.
That's weird.
I'm surprised you didn't punch me in the face right then.
I almost did.
Ã¢ÂÂª Jackie, what the hell?
Why'd you take everything down?
You said, "take everything down".
Well, you didn't have to.
You said, "you have to".
I didn't mean it.
You said, "I mean it".
Look, just put it all back.
Not until you admit you loved it.
Jackie, who cares who's right or wrong here?
Isn't the important thing that you make me happy?
Who are you talking to?
Do you even know me?
Fine.
I loved it.
And?
The twinkle lights were breathtaking.
And?
The scented candles made me feel like laura ingalls.
All right, that's it.
We need to find another place to get married.
I just wrote out, "you are cordial invited to mount hump," And I died a little inside.
Well, then I guess we should also rule out The scenic banks of nipple creek.
Where is michael?
You know, whenever he tells me he has a surprise for me, It makes me a little nervous.
It's probably just 'cause the last time He said that to you, you got pregnant.
Tires squeal) So what do you think?
I think barbie's probably worried sick That her convertible's missing.
I thought you were getting another van.
Oh, so did I, But then I saw this baby down at the police auction, And I knew it was destined to be mine.
Well, hey, man, can I give you some money?
No, it was pretty cheap.
Some guy got stabbed in it.
So nobody else bid on it.
It's pretty sweet, huh?
It's frickin' awesome.
Is it the car, or are you more handsome?
It's the car.
And I'm more handsome.
Michael, don't you think it's a little impractical?
Impractical?
More like imperfecticable.
This thing is totally baby-friendly.
Remind me again how it's baby-friendly.
Cause it's tiny, just like a baby.
barbie, you are gross, but I still love you.
really?
Even though my face is melted off?
yes, but your perfect plastic boobs Remain untouched jewels.
oh, can my twin sister watch?
why just watch?
There's plenty of joe to go around.
I didn't see you.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hey, guys, this is my co-cadet at the police academy, Suzy Simpson.
Simpson, these are my friends.
Take a good look, 'cause you'll probably be arresting some of them in the future.
You're right.
This one looks like the guy in the "What drugs can do to you" filmstrip.
You're a cop, huh?
You don't look like a cop.
You look kind of giggly.
All right, Simpson needed to give me a ride home, 'cause I sprayed myself with mace to see what it'd feel like.
Hey, so, Suzy, which "Charlie's Angels" is your favorite The brainy one, the sporty one or the one that just can't find a bra?
Mine's the one that just can't find a bra.
"Charlie's Angels" are an embarrassment to the badge.
No real cop would last a day dressed like those sluts.
Hey, those sluts are my heroes.
Hey, thanks for giving me a ride, Simpson.
We back up our own.
Point place police, crime free, safe streets!
What's her problem with "charlie's angels"?
Ugh, I bet she watches pbs.
So you and Simpson have been friends for almost two days now, huh?
Isn't it about time you got her pregnant?
No.
It's different with me and Simpson.
For the first time ever, I have a girl that's just a friend.
Like, when Simpson talks, I actually listen instead of watching her boobs go up and down.
Kelso, you've finally gotten past the stage where you have to look at every woman's chest.
Congratulations.
Not exactly.
I'm lookin' at yours right now.
May I say, congratulations to you.
You're such a perv.
And thank you.
Oh, hey.
What took you guys so long at the heart doctor's?
Oh, let me guess.
You had to call in a specialist just to find dad's tiny heart.
You know, we could call in a specialist to find my foot in your ass.
We're gonna need an ass-footologist, stat.
Your father's blood pressure is still high, and the doctor can't figure out why.
So he wants to send some moron over to find the source of my stress.
And I said, "the source of my stress "is when you quacks try to pad my medical bill".
And then the machine went "beep" and the appointment was over.
You know, I don't know what you're so worried about.
They're just gonna blame me.
Shrinks love to blame the wife.
What do they know?
They're barely doctors.
A stuffed animal and a box of tissues could do their job.
Why is Red so stressed?
Huh, it's a mystery, just like when Nancy Drew had to figure out why the man in the clock tower was so mean to his cat.
And what did you found out?
Oh, I don't know, books are too long.
Hello, Wisconsin!
Hi, I'm the stress management specialist, Stuart Sutcliffe.
You played tight end for the packers.
Yeah, till I bent my knee sideways.
Actually, that happened to me in the school musical.
Yeah, I was a dancing mushroom.
Anyway, long story short I finished the number.
This is my son Eric.
Oh, oh, and I am his loving, relaxing wife, kitty.
How about that?
A real live packer in the house.
Ha ha ha ha.
Well, I hope the fact that you both love sports doesn't mean that anyone like, say, his wife would be judged unfairly.
I mean, I love sports.
So don't start me off with four strikes in the last quarter of the super series.
No, no.
Today I'm just a neutral observer with a degree in family therapy and alcohol awareness.
Oh, so, dad, you can talk to him about sports, and, mom, you can talk to him about drinking.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh, pooh.
I was instructed by the doctor to have the occasional medicinal cocktail.
I have a note.
Red, how do you feel about kitty's drinking?
Makes things easier.
But drinking often adds a lot of stress to a household.
If you will excuse me, I'd rather not stay here and listen to you blame me.
Mother hater.
Well, I hope nobody minds if I record today's session.
Hey, this is your lucky day, son.
They say the camera adds 15 pounds.
Really?
I heard it also adds a full head of hair.
Hey, kitty.
You busy?
No.
Red and I are just having our marriage dissected by a teetotaling know-it-all.
Oh, then is now a good time to tell red I broke his chain saw?
No.
He'll be furious with you.
Yes.
He will be furious with you.
Come with me.
So then all the mushrooms jitterbugged Stuart.
Stuart.
This is Bob, the stress causer, Bob broke red's chain saw.
Bob, meet Stuart.
Stuart, blame Bob.
Red, how do you feel about Bob?
Does he cause you stress?
Not really.
Bob's just kind of goofy, like a cartoon.
It's like living next to Elmer Fudd.
That might be the nicest thing you've ever said about me.
You wascal.
Heh heh heh heh.
Oh, so fine.
Now you're best friends.
Now everyone's all happy, and I look like the crazy one just yelling and screaming in the middle of the living room.
Well, I am not the crazy one, even though I am yelling and screaming in the middle of the living room.
Is that a camera?
Yes.
I'm recording today's session.
Well, isn't that just something I didn't know.
?
Michael, we got issued our cop sunglasses.
I've been using 'em to scare the crap out of civilians all day.
Drop the records, punk!
I wasn't stealing them.
Yes, I was.
Fez, this is Suzy Simpson.
She and I are training to be cops.
Oh, if there's more like you at the police academy, that academy deserves an award.
Academy award that's funny.
Yeah, Simpson's wanted to be a cop for, like, forever.
Yeah, it's because of the weapons mostly.
I love things that make a lot of noise Guns and boys.
Well, then load me up, baby, cause I'm ready to go bang.
Well, I'd better go.
I've gotta stop at the candy store.
Wait.
You like candy?
Yeah, I'm out of good & plenty.
It says on the box that there's plenty But it's never enough.
Jinx.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
You owe me a coke!
That is the woman I've been searching for my whole life!
Hey, do you want me to see if she likes you?
Kelso, we've been down that road.
Just give me her address, some binoculars, and I'll handle the rest myself.
Now while we're filming, let's just pretend the camera's not even here.
Now you're going to interact.
I'm gonna write down my observations.
While you're writing down stuff, would you mind autographing this football?
It's brand-new.
Kid never touched it.
Hey, what's going on?
Dude, we're on tv.
How does this thing work?
Hey, Steven, point it at me.
Good morning, Dallas.
I'm Jackie sunshine with your morning weather.
It is going to be sunny today.
So you ladies who let yourself go this winter, stay inside and leave the fellas to us pretty girls.
Please stop touching my camera.
Well, what a lovy day here in the household of the Formans.
I can't say there's a place I'd rather be than with these kinds of people in this kind of place.
What are you, Scarlett O'Hara now?
I am being soft and gracious.
Now clam it!
Mom, you know, they have talkies now.
Oh, forget it.
I give up.
Where is the "off" button on this thing?
Mrs. Forman, I need to see things as they happen!
All right, you clocked this lady doin' 38 in a 35 zone.
Recite it and write it.
License and registration, ma'am.
Use the glasses.
They're powerful.
It's like a gun you wear on your face.
License and registration, ma'am.
Ooh, that felt good.
Hey, guess what.
I know someone who likes you and thinks that you're cute and smart and funny.
Ah.
Well, I think I know who you're talking about, and I like him, too.
Huh?
What do you like about him?
I like how hot he looks sitting across from me I n a blue t-shirt eating a hot dog.
You just described me.
Oh, crap.
Man, I thought Simpson was different.
She's supposed to just be my buddy.
Now I'm gonna have to sleep with her.
No, Michael, no.
Set her up with fez.
He's the one who likes her.
Fez needs something, man.
Guy's so desperate, he's been rubbing himself around on the couch like a cat.
What you need to do is put 'em together in a romantic situation.
Suzy might not like fez at first, but he won't take "no" for an answer.
He's like one freaky, horny little dude.
Just ask the couch.
Hey, I was thinking maybe tomorrow you could help me brush up on my target practice.
It's a date.
Yeah, I'll be there.
You'll be there.
On a date.
So I'll see you at the shooting range.
For our date.
Your first date with Suzy's all set up, and she told me that she's crazy about you.
Well, I'd like to say I'm surprised, but I'm a little crazy about me, too.
Well, it's all set.
Fez is going on a date with Suzy, who's going on a date with me and doesn't know she's going on a date with fez.
I'm ready for our date, Michael.
I'm ready for our date, Suzy.
Oh, yeah!
?
it's such a shame you won't be able to film anymore.
Look, there's one last exercise I want to try Role-playing.
All right, come on.
All right, now you're going to be Eric.
Eric, you're going to be your father.
Mr. Forman, you can start.
Well I'm just a skinny Smart-mouthed kid who always has something to say about everything.
And I wish I was an octopus.
So I could put eight feet in eight different asses.
"Star wars".
"Star wars".
"Star wars"!
Dead commies!
Dead commies!
Dead commies!
All right, hold it.
Time out.
Time out.
I think I know what the problem is.
All right, fine.
I drink a little.
What?
I have a very difficult job, and I come home at night, and, well Drinks are her nightly reward.
Mrs. Forman, I believe the source of your husband's stress is Oh, here it comes.
Your son!
Him?
Me?
It's not me?
Oh, boy!
You think my problem is my own son?
My son is a fine young man.
Oh, dad, you don't have Shut up, dumb-ass.
You know less about my family than you do about football, which isn't saying much since you dropped every pass that came near you.
And let me tell you something else When a real packer hurts his leg, he stuffs his kneecap back in and keeps on running!
That's what this little mushroom would have done.
?
I love this place The sweet smell of gunpowder, the deafening boom of shotgun blasts.
Oops, that kind of talk is more appropriate for the bedroom.
I apologize.
Knock.
Knock.
Who's there?
Ivan.
Ivan who?
I've an awful lot of candy for the both of us.
Fez?
Well, if it's not me, then there's some lucky bastard who looks just like me.
Michael, I thought it was just gonna be you, me, and a box of hot lead.
Well, it's even better.
It's you, me, and a box of hot fez.
Kelso, this wasn't part of the deal.
What wasn't part of the deal?
You!
So beat it.
I want her to smell nothing but me.
Okay, you know what?
I'm kind of in the way.
I'm gonna go next door, and maybe you can show fez how to shoot.
Try to close the deal before she realizes you're a foreigner.
So where do we start?
I could rifle through the manual, but why don't you just give me the bullet points?
Fez, I never joke about guns.
OhShoot.
I have no discipline.
Okay.
You're gonna just take aim and squeeze gently.
Squeebee-geegee.
Here.
Put these on and take a few shots.
I'm just gonna go check on Michael.
So he's not alone.
Cologne?
Oh, yeah, I mixed a bunch of different ones, and, you know, I make my own scent.
Hey, Michael.
Do you want me to hold your shoulders while you shoot or maybe square off your thighs?
You know whose thighs need squaring off?
Fez's.
Yeah, bad.
Oh, and by the way, he also told me that he thinks you're really nice.
Oh, well, he's nice, too.
And now that I can understand some of what he's saying, he's kind of charming.
Oh, look, a rabbit.
I love animals.
You know who really loves animals?
Fez.
He does?
Yeah.
The bunny!
I got dinner!
?
and then my dad actually gave me a compliment "My son's a fine young man".
That's like the most loving thing he said to me since he told me that I could be worse.
Are you sure red was talking about you?
I mean, I love you, but you are a little high-maintenance.
And not in a good way like me.
Remember when it took red all summer to teach you how to catch a ball 'cause you were too scared of it?
First, red had him look at a picture of a ball.
Then he put him in a room with a ball.
And then he moves him closer until he wasn't screaming being right next to the ball.
What is so scary about a ball?
People throw it right at you, okay?
I'm sorry about what I did to that poor bunny.
I guess my gun really had a hare trigger, huh?
Too soon?
Yes, too soon.
Well, I apologize for ruining our first date.
Our first date?
No, I was there on a date with Michael.
What?
No, no, he told me we were on a date.
He told me we were on a date.
You and me "we" or he and you "we"?
I think one of us has been lied to and the other one, too.
Well, then you should be very angry, which means I am, too!
Hey, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Michael, what kind of game are you playing, inviting me on a date that wasn't with you?
Yeah, I second that, but about her.
And add, "you son of bitch".
Okay, look, I have a really good explanation for this, but I left it at home.
Oh, dad.
Uh, about what you said to the stress management guy I just wanted to say thanks.
Okay.
Okay.
You said it.
We're both embarrassed.
Now move along.
No, I mean Look, I could be a little less of a smart-ass.
And you're my father.
Your life matters to me.
So anyway, dad, I Eric, if you say, "I love you," my heart is going to explode.
Ah, kitty, uh, what's for dinner?
Well, the camera's off, so I'm having a Margarita with salt.
You two are on your own.
Kelso So this is where you go after a hard day of screwing me over!
All right, look, fez, I'm really sorry.
Zip it, fool!
You stole my girl, and I really need a girl.
Here, fez.
You're probably gonna want some personal time with the couch.
I even plumped up the pillows for you.
No, I cannot be in the same room with him.
You and I are through.
Now good day.
But, fez Fez, he said, "but, fez" Oh, I heard him.
Well, now you're supposed to say "I say good day".
Yeah, and then we all know that you're really mad, but eventually, you'll get over it.
Oh, you'd like that.
Dance, monkey, dance.
Oh, kelso, this monkey don't dance no more.
But, fez I said good day!
Arrrh!
Oh, fez, it was so nice of you to make dinner for us.
Yeah, this is amazing.
Well, food always tastes better when it's fresh.
So what is this anyway?
Well, let's just say that the Easter bunny came early this year, so I shot him.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
So Fez thought he was on a date with Suzy, and he shot a rabbit to impress her.
Doesn't he know he could have just bought her flowers?
Oh, I would die if you got me flowers.
You'd be lucky to get a dead rabbit.
Suzy, why would Fez think you'd like a dead rabbit?
Are you from the south or something?
No.
I think he did it because he knows that as a cop, I like to spill blood.
But I want to hurt people, not animals.
You know what?
This is my fault.
I never should have told Fez you liked him when you liked me.
If only there was something I could do to make him feel better.
I have an idea.
Oh, good.
Kelso's gonna make it worse now.
No, look.
Just let Fez take you to dinner, and then for dessert, do it with him.
No way.
Okay, if you do me this favor, I'll buy you a new gun.
That would make her a hooker.
No.
Hookers do it for money.
This would be for a gun.
Hey, I have standards.
I mean, if it's sleeping with a suspect to extract some information, fine, or posing as a prostitute for a quickie in the back of a car to snare some John, sure.
But jeez, Michael, what kind of girl do you think I am?
Hello, Suzy.
I'd love to stand here and stare at you until you get uncomfortable But I have a relationship to end.
Kelso, here's everything you ever gave me.
I don't want it anymore.
Look, Fez, you don't have to do this.
Yeah.
Fez, when you split up with someone, you don't have to give stuff back.
You wait until they leave the house, take everything they care about and break the rest.
That way, they have nothing.
Lucky for me I already have nothing.
Oh, you can have less.
The point is that I don't want anything you gave me.
I never gave you my yo-yo.
So I took it, and I tangled the string, too.
Let's see you walk the dog now, you son of a bitch.
Are those new birth-control pills?
Let the doing it commence.
Do you have to do that every time?
Donna, if I had the money, I'd take out an ad in the paper.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Never say, "oh, no" when you're talking about birth-control pills.
Anything's better than "oh, no".
I forgot to take one.
Except that.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
One minute my life's all light and breezy, and the next, I'm shackled to you and some kid.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, my heart is pounding so hard Like in the cartoons, when Daisy duck sees Donald duck, and her heart goes, "ba-bo!
Ba-boom"!
But that was a happy thing, and this is 'cause you couldn't keep your dirty hands off me!
Okay, come on, let's think.
Hey, there's only a couple times a month something like this can happen, right?
Maybe there's some kind of time-related loophole.
Hey, did we spring forward or fall back?
When we did it?
I don't know.
I don't know what you'd call it, but it's the same every time.
Well, I can't be that bad, Donna.
I got you pregnant!
Hello, Wisconsin!
Eric, I can't believe you knocked up a girl, too.
I mean, you lose points for not doing it in a public place, but hey, gimme five.
Kelso, I don't really think this is a gimme five moment, okay?
I am really freaked out.
Well, right now I'm not so much freaked out as starving.
I'm fascinated by your nose.
Yeah, it's perfect.
You'd be amazed at what I could fit up in there.
But the important thing is that you have responsibilities now, so you gotta step up like I did.
Look, if you mean you stepped up on a urinal to climb out of a window to get away from the girl you got pregnant, then yeah, you stepped up.
Still no Fez, huh?
Wow, kelso, you really must have pissed him off.
He hasn't stayed away this long since he discovered bubble baths.
Yeah.
Fez still isn't talking to me, but I think he's calling, 'cause every once in awhile, I pick up the phone, and all I hear is breathing and the crinkle of a candy being unwrapped.
Man, we are sitting in the circle talking about relationships.
What happened to us?
This stash must be from California.
Oh, hey, Donna.
Any news?
Come on, that time of the month!
No.
Nothing yet.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna throw up.
I told you we should have gone to Denny's.
Oh, yeah, Donna, let's not talk about throwing up in front of the customers.
Ma'am, here's your creamed corn.
I got no interest in getting a lady pregnant.
That's why I'm celibate.
I thought it was because no one would do it with you.
Hey, that's, like, a secondary reason.
Look, Donna, we're gonna figure this out, okay?
Hey, you know what?
We can ask my mom.
She's a nurse.
She loves this stuff.
At least once a week, she gives a talk about her uterus.
Eric, I don't want your mom to know.
Donna's right.
There's no reason to let too many people know just yet.
Who have you told so far?
Well, just my friends and this nice couple.
Okay, look, so I'll just tell you what my mom says, okay?
Okay.
Just make sure she doesn't know you're talking about us.
Tell her you have a friend, a Canadian friend, who lives in an igloo, so she can't call her.
Donna, I think I know how to be subtle.
Mommy, mommy!
Donna might be pregnant!
Did she trap you?
We'll move you away.
We won't play her game.
No.
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just I had to tell someone.
Hey, promise me you won't say anything to dad.
Fine.
I promise.
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should never have been intimate with your father while you were in the crib next to the bed.
Hey, Fez.
Well, I don't think he wants to make up.
Well, try anyway.
I got your back Your strong, muscular back.
Uh, Fez, look, I got you some candy and a "Playboy" and a six-pack.
So you can use 'em in whatever order you want.
Tell him what they're for.
In a tense standoff, you need to make the perp think you're on his side, even if you're about to put a bullet in his head.
Don't worry.
We're not.
Uh They're a peace offering.
Well, look at the American trying to buy his way out of trouble.
Fez, give Michael a chance.
You know what?
No, Simpson, forget it.
Fez, you're the one that blew it with Suzy, okay?
I don't know you were going to shoot a defenseless rabbit.
Well, if you didn't know that, then you never knew me at all!
Whatever!
You know what, I don't care if you're mad at me, 'cause now I'm mad at you!
Fine!
Well, you could keep your stupid gifts, because now I don't want them!
If you must know, it will be this then this.
So you knocked up the neighbour girl.
Oh, my God.
You should've been thinking a little more about God before you got into this mess.
He would've stopped you at first base.
Mom, you promised you wouldn't say anything.
And I didn't.
I wrote it down.
So you're pregnant.
Okay, well, um, okay.
We'll move the wedding to next month, and then nine months later, we'll tell people the baby came early because you smoked.
No.
I don't want to move the wedding up.
Don't we get a say in this?
Red, say something.
Oh.
Donna, he's not gonna help us.
Right now he's trying to figure out how to get both of his feet in both of our asses without leaving his chair.
Stop being weird.
We'll just have to make the best of this.
Besides, with Donna for a mother, there's a decent chance the kid'll be good at sports.
Well, Donna, I think you're too young to be a mother, so here's what we do Tell the kid you're his sister, midge and I are the parents, and when he turns 18, tell him we lied.
Probably get a good chuckle out of the whole thing.
Eric, a little help?
Okay.
You guys Okay.
Whether we're pregnant or not, we can run our own lives, okay?
Yeah.
And you know what?
It would have been great if Donna could have had a career, but things change.
So, you know, fine, so you'll stay home with the baby.
Whoa.
What?
So I don't get a career?
Well, you know You could sell tupperware or something.
Okay, you can just get bent.
What?
Oh, come on.
What did I say?
That wasn't so bad, was it?
No.
I would love a tupperware lady in the family.
Oh, hey, Jackie, have you seen Donna?
Is she okay?
Well, she wanted me to tell you a secret.
Okay.
Ow!
Hey, guys.
Ooh, what stinks out here?
It must be this big, girl-stealing turd.
All right.
That's it.
Let's go.
Oh, I will slap you silly.
Oh, stop!
Hey, look, Jackie's right, all right?
If you guys want to fight, let's go inside where there's more stuff to hit your head on.
Come on, you guys, lots of couples fight, but there's an easy way to fix this.
Just decide which one of you is the woman, and the other one just apologize.
No.
I don't want to make up with kelso.
I want to make fun of kelso.
Hey, guys, what's up with kelso?
Stupid.
Hey, guys, what's up with Fez?
Foreign.
Okay, you guys, this I s getting pretty lame.
Let's split into two groups.
Good idea boys and girls.
Let's go, Jackie.
What?
How you doing, kitten?
Fine.
I don't know.
I'm scared.
Just know that whether you're pregnant or not, you're still my little girl.
I support you.
Thanks, dad.
But if you are pregnant, don't let red touch the baby.
He thinks he's tickling, but he just pokes.
Trust me, I know from experience.
Well, dad, maybe red wasn't trying to tickle you.
Maybe he was trying to poke you.
Why would red poke me?
Why would he tickle you?
Fez, since you're mad at Michael, shouldn't you be cutting his head out of those pictures instead of your head?
Oh, I can't do that.
Have you seen how well he photographs?
Fez, I can't believe you're gonna let it end this way.
I always thought you and Michael would make it.
Well, we look good in public, but you weren't there for the bad times Like he never noticed when I got a new outfit.
Fez, just do what I did to get over Michael.
Make out with Hyde?
No.
Just stop thinking about him.
I can't.
Even the hub reminds me of him.
I remember this one day.
It was the only day the hub ever had tater tots And there was this really big tater tot, and I'll never forget what kelso said.
He said That's not a tater tot.
That's a tater giant".
Oh, how we laughed.
Oh, Fez, Michael took me for granted, too.
But I found someone better, and so will you.
Yeah, don't end it all now.
You have so much to live for.
That's what we say when 're trying to talk down a jumper.
I guess it doesn't really apply here.
You know, I'm glad Fez is out of my life.
Always with the mood swings, and I'd ask what's wrong, and all I'd hear was, "nothing".
And then the minute I want to watch a game, suddenly it's time to talk about our feelings.
Women.
Actually, we're talking about a man.
Boy, you guys are progressive.
The thing is, I know I didn't do anything wrong, but where am I gonna find another friend like Fez?
Look, man, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, okay?
It's like when you and Jackie broke up.
It was for the best, and after awhile, she found someone better me.
And since then, I've enjoyed throwing that in your face as often as possible.
What was your question again?
Oh, my God.
Great news Donna's not pregnant.
She's not talking to me, and she kind of hung up on me, but that click and dead silence was the most beautiful sound I ever heard.
Well, what a relief, but you and I are still having a good, long talk about the uterus.
Man, dodged a bullet there, huh?
Almost had a little dumb-ass running around here, huh?
I'm gonna go throw up now.
You know, you have been awfully calm about this whole thing.
You haven't threatened to put a foot in anyone's rear all day.
Well, I I guess I was kind of looking forward to having a grandkid.
I mean, since my heart attack, I've realized at life is short, and it would be nice to know my grandkids before I go.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Well, you know, if you're really disappointed, we could always ask Laurie.
She might have a few kids we don't know about.
Simpson, I'm here.
Where's the cat on the trampoline?
Sorry, Michael.
There is no cat.
Is there at least a trampoline?
Please have a seat.
Tater tots.
You know, the last time the hub had tater tots was when Suzy, I got your message.
Where's the bouncing kitty?
What's he doing here?
Okay, I've called you here because it's time you two talked things over, and I've used tater tots to recreate one of your happiest times together.
Oh, look!
There's a really big one.
That's not a tater tot.
That's a tater giant.
I look at your jumbo tot, and I feel nothing.
I, too, resist your tot.
Oh, come on, Michael, Fez is a great guy.
He's he's loyal and sweet and innocent.
And, Fez, Michael's great, too.
He's pure and strong and More man than I've ever seen in one pair of pants.
Hey, he's not so pure.
He's expecting a baby with another woman.
What?
!
Well, he's not so innocent.
He's married.
What?
Oh, my God.
You're both disgusting!
I don't want either one of you, and you really missed out, because I spent a semester in France, and I do stuff American girls think is gross.
Whoa.
What was that about?
Yeah.
She's flipping out 'cause someone she likes is married or having an illegitimate child.
What's she gonna do when there's real trouble?
Yeah, we're better off without her.
Yeah.
Wait.
"We"?
Ah, I guess I've missed you.
Really?
Man, 'cause I missed you, too, and, well, I wasn't trying to steal her.
I wanted her to be with you.
That's okay.
I'd rather have my friend back anyway.
Do you wanna I do if you do.
I do.
We are so lucky.
I mean, it's obvious we're not ready to be parents.
What would we do?
Hey, anything you want.
And by the way, when I said you could sell tupperware, that was just, like, code for you could be president of the United States.
I don't believe you, but I'm too relieved to be mad.
I'll probably bring it up when we're having a fight about something else.
Listen, Donna, all I know is, we can never make this mistake again.
Yeah, don't worry.
I think we learned our lesson.
Hurry up, Donna.
You're, uh, you're cutting into your foreplay time.
One second.
Oh, no!
What?
!
What?
!
Just kidding.
That's not funny, Donna.
I can't even do it now.
Yes, I can.
What would a French girl do that an American girl would think is gross?
It could be anything.
They eat snails.
Maybe it's foot stuff.
Foot stuff?
What would you do to a foot?
I don't know, like Lick it or something.
What is wrong with you?
What are you, some kind of foot licker?
No.
I wouldn't lick.
I would get licked.
Oh God!
Why did I say that?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
It's been like an hour, and my dad is still upstairs talking to your folks.
Our pregnancy scare must have really freaked 'em out.
Yeah, well, that's because "pregnancy" is one of the scariest words in the english language right after "monster" and "broccoli".
Well, I'm not pregnant.
Everything's fine, so I'm sure our parents will calm down soon.
Hey, fornicators, upstairs!
Oh, god, we're dead.
You know what?
None of this would have happened if you hadn't insisted on sleeping with me.
I insisted?
You wouldn't give me my wallet back.
Look, we're in this together.
You were there, too.
Or was I?
The jedi mind trick doesn't work in real life, dink.
Or does it?
Oh, hey, what's shakin', gang?
Certainly not Donna's belly from being pregnant, right?
You're not funny.
You're a sinner.
Now sit.
We have decided that you two need premarital counseling at church.
Premarital?
Counseling?
Church?
Why am I talking like a speak & spell?
Dad, you think this is a good idea?
No.
I suggested we get him fixed like a dog.
Counseling can be extremely beneficial.
I knew two boys who were about to marry their sweethearts.
One boy went to counseling, and one didn't.
And the one who didn't go to counseling died.
I'll tell ya, if Midge and I had counseling, it might have saved our marriage.
Of course, not sleeping with degenerates from the pool hall would have helped, too.
So you want us to go to counseling?
Mom, where do you even come up with this stuff?
It wasn't my idea.
Steven was thoughtful enough to suggest it.
You're welcome.
That 70's show S06E14 Hangin' out That 70's show S06E14 down the street the same old thing that you did last week not a thing to do but talk to you we're all all right we're all all right  hello, Wisconsin!
Okay, you guys, this church counseling idea is really crappy.
Would you listen to the language on this kid?
What he needs is church and lots of it.
You know, Eric, you may not think that you need counseling, but maybe Donna does.
No, she doesn't.
Well, actually, I think counseling might help us work through some of our issues before we get married.
We don't have issues.
Yes, we do.
No, we don't.
Do.
Okay, see?
You don't do the do/don't if you don't have issues, which you do.
Okay, dad, how can you think this is a good idea?
You always say to take care of family business at home.
I am taking care of business at home.
Because if you two don't do this, do you know what it's gonna be like living with your mother?
Just more of a delight every day, is what.
Well, come on, Eric.
We'll learn stuff about each other.
For instance, what if one day I get a high-paying job in California?
Will you move?
Whoa.
Why can't I get the high-paying job?
Okay, what if you get a high-paying job?
Will I move?
Who am I kidding?
I'm not getting a high-paying job.
All right, civilians.
Hide your stashes.
Officer-in-training Kelso's back from the academy.
I gotta be honest, man.
Every day you come home with all your fingers, I die a little inside.
Michael, you got another "D" on a test?
Is this your fourth "D" in a row?
Yeah.
It's just on the penal code stuff.
Criminals have a right to an attorney.
Criminals are innocent until proven guilty.
Just crazy liberal gibberish.
What are you laughing at?
He said "penal code".
Fez, it doesn't mean that.
It's from the word "penalty".
"Penal".
You're like a 4 year old.
It's a legal term.
"Penal".
It's kind of funny.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Michael.
How'd your penal code test go?
I did great.
I got another "B".
Oh, that's your fourth "B" in a row.
I'm so proud of you.
Can I see it?
Uh uh, you could, but I didn't write anything down 'cause the test was oral.
Oral test on the penal code.
so, um are you free this afternoon?
I thought maybe we could do something.
How about go-carting?
Um how about putting together a crib?
Does the crib have wheels?
Yeah.
Then I'm in.
Great.
I'll meet you outside.
Bye, guys.
Bye.
Hey, Michael, how come you told library barbie you got "B"s instead of "D"s?
Look, some people bring flowers.
Some people buy chocolates.
I lie about my intelligence.
It's not working.
She's locked up the old funhouse, if you know what I mean.
Michael, no way.
She's totally into you.
She changed from clear lip gloss to pink shimmer.
What more does she need to do, shout "I love you" from the rooftops?
Well, she could give me something besides a kiss on the cheek.
It's like kissing your cousin.
Oh, the cousin kiss the sexiest of all relative kisses.
Right above big-breasted aunt and sleepy grandma.
Did you just say "sleepy grandma"?
You telling me you kiss your grandma?
Not my grandma.
A grandma.
Sick bastard.
I gotta say, I'm excited about marriage counseling.
I'm looking forward to hearing from a third party that I'm right about everything.
Oh, and I want my marriage to Eric to be magical.
I know how you could do that.
Marry someone besides Eric.
Hey, I'll see you guys later.
I got someplace I really need to be.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had someplace I really needed to be.
Okay, so get this.
I don't want counseling.
Donna does.
So we're going.
I'll tell ya, ever since we got engaged, she's been treating me like some kind of child.
Oh, where's my toy surprise?
Oh, Kelso, watch it with that gun, man.
Oh, relax, Eric.
It's not a gun.
It's a flare gun.
Yeah, tomorrow's flare day at the academy, so we're learning how to use these.
Besides, they're totally safe.
All they do is shoot balls of fire.
Kelso, I don't think you should be playing with fire when we're all never mind.
Man, I gotta stop hitting two circles in one day.
I could swear I just saw a ball of fire shoot through this room.
Zowie!
Okay, so what brings you to counseling?
A firm tug on the old ball and chain, if you know what I mean.
What Eric is trying to say is we wanted to talk to someone about the pitfalls of marriage.
And we have some little issues.
For example, Eric sometimes likes to talk too much about "Star Wars".
I understand.
You do?
See, this is great.
Yeah, "Star Wars" is the greatest movie of all time.
It's hard not to talk about "Star Wars".
Wow!
This is great!
Oh, oh, no.
I can't believe you've seen "Star Wars".
Well, I like to stay current with pop culture, so that I can connect with the youth I counsel.
Say how about that disco?
Um, disco kinda blows.
I agree.
Blow on, disco.
Blow on.
Can we get back to me and Eric, please?
Because sometimes I feel like we're racing toward this wedding, and we're not even enjoying it as much as we could be.
Hmm, I see.
Like in "Star Wars," when Luke, much like the two of you, wasn't the pilot of his own future.
But he was a great pilot.
He used to bull's-eye wamp rats in his t-16 back home!
I should be marrying you.
I thought this was a counseling session, not a dork-off.
I'm sorry, Donna.
Okay, look, instead of talking about what worries you about marriage, let's talk about what excites you about marriage.
Oh.
Okay, well hmm.
That's weird.
I can't really think of anything.
You can't think of anything?
Well, hang on.
Give me a second.
Nope.
Nothing.
Well, one thing young newlyweds usually get excited about, and that's having sexual relations for the first time.
I'm sure you're both looking forward to that.
Oh, um unless of course, you've already had sex.
Premarital sex.
What?
Huh?
Pre-what-ital-who?
I mean, come on, look at me.
Do I look like some guy who's had sex?
I mean right?
You're seeing pictures of what's left of the point place police academy auditorium, where a fire Broke out today.
I hope Kelso's okay.
Yeah, I know he's there, 'cause today was flare day.
Today was flare day!
Hey, what's up?
okay, fine.
I was at the academy when the auditorium burned down, but it totally wasn't my fault.
See, I got there early to practice with my flare gun 'cause I wanted to show brooke an actual "B" for a change.
Okay, so far zero percent your fault.
All right, so I accidentally shot off a flare, and it went all right underneath the bleachers.
Well, we've just jumped up to about 60% your fault.
Okay, so then I shot off another flare at the first flare 'cause you know what they say.
You gotta fight fire with fire.
Yeah, this is now, like, 99% your fault.
So then I shot off another flare to warn people about the fire.
But that one just went right up and on the roof, and that's when I just got the hell out of there.
$5?
For Pete's sakes, God doesn't drive a cadillac.
you know, in these times of loose morals, even my faith gets challenged, much like Han Solo's faith in his sometimes unreliable "Millennium Falcon".
Which is why I'm so pleased to recently meet a young engaged couple who have turned their backs on temptation, despite the lure of premarital sex.
Oh, no.
Oh, god.
Oh, no.
So here they are; Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti.
Please stand.
Oh, look, it's Eric and Donna.
Did everyone know they're virgins?
I think I wanna be a virgin, too.
Hey, everyone, I'm a virgin!
Well, I said it, so it must be true.
Okay, I know this seems really bad, but I got a really simple way to fix this.
Just start going to a different church.
Hey, how about that one where they sing more and let you marry, like, six people?
Hey, Red, tell me the story about how Eric and Donna had to stand up in front of the whole church and pretend to be virgins.
Once upon a time, two dumb-asses went to church and brought shame upon their entire family.
And their father had to hear about it the whole damn car ride home!
That is a great story.
It's scary, but it's funny, too.
What I don't understand is how you can lie to a pastor in church.
Well, Mrs. Forman, what about the time you lied to pastor Dan?
You told him your dog ate your bake sale cookies, but you didn't bake them 'cause you were too busy sipping kahlúa and watching that Paul Newman retrospective.
I did not lie to pastor Dan in church.
I lied to him at the market, and at the market, he is just a regular man.
Now you two march back to church and tell him the truth.
And for you information, Donna, kahlúa is barely a drink.
It's like root beer.
So I can't believe the police academy caught fire.
What happened?
Huge mystery.
Like what part of the cow is the hot dog?
Maybe Kelso's just too traumatized to remember.
I think he needs help filling in the blanks, like the fire was started with a blank gun by a blanking idiot named blank-O.
Hey, Brooke, could you wait outside for a minute?
Mrs. Forman has this rule that there's only five people in the kitchen at one time.
Well, there are five people here.
That's why you need to leave.
But you said no more than five.
Right.
But I'm number five.
Exactly.
So I'll just wait outside then?
Attagirl.
Hey, Jackie, I suspect Kelso hasn't told Brooke that he burned down the police academy.
Interesting.
I suspect you're right, Steven.
Fez, what do you think?
I think I smell cookies.
All right, fine, so I haven't told her.
But the only reason she likes me is 'cause I'm doing well at the academy.
Michael, you can't start a relationship based on a huge lie.
You have to start off fresh, and then gently sprinkle in the lies as you go along.
A relationship is like a cookie, and the lies are the tasty chocolate chips.
Where are the cookies, damn it?
Okay, what did you want to tell me?
Well, you see, pastor Dan, when we were here before and you had asked us about premarital sex, we might have-- we lied, okay?
We have had sex zillions of times.
I used to try to keep track on a pad, but it got unwieldy.
Oh, god.
Eric!
I'm sorry, Donna, but we are knocking on hell's door, and I ain't goin' in!
Eric, you're not going to hell.
But you might be.
I don't know you that well.
I just think you're depriving yourselves of that wonderful moment when marriage is cemented by giving the gift of yourselves.
Wow.
I never thought about it that way.
Maybe that's why you couldn't figure out the whole excitement about marriage.
The one thing you should have been looking forward to, you had already experienced.
Maybe you knew that without realizing it.
Um I don't mean to bring up "Star Wars" again.
This is a lot like Luke before he discovered the force.
Exactly.
And what is the force in real life?
Brooke I gotta tell you something.
I burnt down the police academy auditorium.
See, this flare just got away from me.
And then there was another flare that was on purpose, but a bad idea, and a final warning flare that I now realize was unnecessary, 'cause the fire itself was a pretty big flare.
Well, Michael, I'm glad you're honest with me because I kind of have a secret, too.
You have a twin sister that loves threesomes.
No.
I've stopped myself from getting close to you because I didn't know if I could trust you.
I knew you were lying about the police academy fire because, well, your friends kind of gave it away in the kitchen.
Also Fez took me aside today and just told me.
And kinda tried to kiss me.
Yeah, he does that.
But you were honest with me, which means I can trust you now.
So is there anything else you'd like to be honest with me about, like maybe your test grades?
Yeah.
I didn't get four "B"s.
I kinda figured.
I got four "A"s.
I just didn't want to brag.
Well, we committed seven mortal sins, and all we got was a half an hour lecture.
Yeah, but still, I want our wedding day to be special.
You know, something we'll remember forever.
You know what?
Whatever it takes.
Which is why I think we shouldn't have sex again until we're married.
What?
No.
What?
No.
No, no, no, no.
You can't cut me off now.
I'm addicted now.
Look, Eric, I know it seems like a crazy idea.
Oh, I see your plan, lady.
The first three years are free, huh?
Eric, it'll be great.
When you think about it, it's really similar to "Star Wars" and staying pure, just like a jedi.
There's no such thing as jedi.
That's just a stupid movie!
God!
Last sunday we recognized wesex It is my bad duty to report that they were lying!
to me, to their families to god himself.
So let their correct..
justice Please stand Eric Forman and Danna Pinciotti.
Amen.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Oh, hey, Donna, about this little celibacy kick we're on, does that cover quickies, 'cause I could be really quick?
Well, that's why I call you "the flash".
That's why you call me the flash?
I thought it was 'cause I was flashy, like an entertainer.
Come on, one little one.
You can even watch tv.
Eric, we agreed to hold off until the wedding.
It's cleansing.
No, Donna, giving up cigarettes is cleansing.
Giving up sex is reckless and irresponsible, and I think it might cause cancer.
Hey, Jackie, I know since you moved in, we agreed to give each other messages as soon as possible, and in the spirit of that, your mom called last Tuesday.
What?
No, she couldn't call.
She's in mexico.
They don't have phones there.
Uh, yeah, they do.
Why would we give them phones?
My dad tried to get back in touch with me once.
Instead of calling, he just left a six-pack on my car.
How'd you know it was him?
He was passed out on the hood.
Well, I don't have anything to say to my mom.
She ditched me three months ago, and that's all I need to know.
Oh, man, that's really sad.
It's like a mother and daughter divided.
So, hey, what about some second base action?
What did I tell you about talking about the bases, flash?
Donna.
He doesn't know why.
Jackie, you should cut your mom a break.
I think she's charming.
If she calls again, just tell her I don't want to see her.
Well, that's too bad 'cause I just picked her up from the airport.
And here I am.
Mom!
Oh, I love making an entrance.
Be a dear and go watch my luggage.
Really?
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Who cares?
Welcome to my driveway, pretty lady.
I'm Eric Forman.
Remember me?
Big fan.
Oh, right, my toy poodle snowball almost killed you when you were 6.
I was 13, but, yeah.
Mrs. Burkhart, Steven Hyde.
Nice to see you again.
Just thought I'd let you know that Jackie and I are kind of dating now.
Didn't you rob our house?
Well, I was in there a few times at night, but I never took anything.
Mrs. Burkhart!
I thought I saw gorgeous, flowing hair on bronze shoulders, And I wasn't near a mirror, so I knew it had to be you.
Mom, why are you back?
It got rainy in Cabo, so I hopped on a plane.
Wish I was a plane.
Then she could hop on me.
And by hop on me, I mean Yeah, yeah, we got it, Fez.
Wait, let me guess.
"rainy in Cabo" is Spanish for "my rich pilot boyfriend ran out of money".
Don't be silly.
I don't know any Spanish, Except for gracias amas tequila.
I just missed you.
Well, I didn't miss you.
And there's the stomp and cry.
See you guys tomorrow.
Miss Burkhart, I know you and Jackie are working through some difficult stuff, but may I just say, nice tan?
Yeah, it really makes everything pop.
Yeah, I'm popping a little right now.
Why don't we ever have tea?
Well, this sounds like the beginning of a wonderful argument Like the stuffing versus mashed potatoes fight that turned into why don't I ever take you on vacation.
Why don't you ever take me on vacation?
Oh, crap.
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Forman, I don't know what to do.
Not this again.
Kitty, make it stop.
Now be nice, Red.
Her mom finally came home from her cultural tour of Mexico's many fine bars and cantinas.
Why did she have to go all the way to Mexico to drink all day?
Why couldn't she be a good mom and just do it at home like you do?
Well, that's a good question.
And you need to sit down and talk to her about it.
You can do it here with tea.
We'll have tea!
No!
Why does this always happen here?
We're in a recession.
There are vacant lots all over the place.
Well, you can go stand in a vacant lot.
We're having a tea party with crumpets.
I'll find out what they are, and we will have them.
Okay, but I don't know if I can look my mom in the eye.
I mean, I never thought I'd say this, but there comes a point when a person is too tan.
Whoa, check out this new police academy they're sending me to in waukegan.
It's got its own pool!
Oh, man, if I'd have known it was gonna be this nice, I'd have burned down the old one a lot sooner.
Kelso, I'm really going to miss you.
Who's gonna take my lunch money and tease me and pull down my pants in front of girls?
I'll be taking over.
Hey, you're still gonna drive me up there, right?
Oh, man, Jackie's got this heavy thing with her mom.
I know she's gonna wanna talk about it a lot.
So, yeah, I'll drive you.
Hey, since Donna cut me off, I took the money that I would have spent on a romantic dinner for two and bought me a gross of bottle rockets.
Take that, Pinciotti!
Bottle rockets, all right.
Fez, start running.
No, wait.
I got a better idea.
After we drop him off, let's stop off at the dairy farm, scare the hell out of some cows.
Ooh, I love cows.
They're the one animal I can run faster than.
No, no, let's go before you drop me off.
That big spotted one needs an attitude adjustment.
No, man, it's got to be at night.
Look, I've launched so much stuff at those cows during the day, I swear, they recognize my car.
I can't believe you guys are going without me.
Those cows will never know what hit them.
And even after it hits them, they still won't know, because they're cows.
Okay, here, Red, try this tea.
It'll make you feel british.
mum's the word, governor.
Kitty, this is America.
We bomb countries that drink tea.
Well, that's because coffee keeps us awake all night, and we wake up in such a bad mood, we have to bomb someone.
Ooh, ooh, I bet that's Jackie's mom.
I still don't think we should get involved in this.
As far as I'm concerned, this is between Jackie and her ditzy lush of a mom.
Hi.
You must be Red.
I'm Pam Burkhart.
It's Pam.
You made tea.
Oh, I love tea.
So do I. Wipe your chin, honey.
You got some drool.
Thank you both so much for doing this.
You know, when you are as beautiful as I am, it's hard to know who your real friends are.
Oh, I'm sorry that you have to go through that.
I'm just hoping that Jackie and I figure out a way to get along.
Well, you've got your low-cut, getting-along sweater on, so I bet that'll help.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
And by "hi," I mean, not hi, because I'm not talking to you, even though I'm talking now.
So I'm just gonna stop talking, starting now.
Oh!
Dang it.
Starting now.
And now.
This is awkward.
Why don't I tell a story about something charming I did in Mexico?
I'd love to hear it.
There was this woman on a beach in cozumel.
and normally, I wouldn't talk to someone who had such bad skin, but she was selling the cutest hair clips, so here.
You know, I'd tell you that doesn't fix anything, but I'm not talking to you.
Oh, shoot!
Starting now!
Yeah, nice try, Mrs. Burkhart.
Damn, these are cute.
Look, Jackie, when your father got into trouble, I panicked, but that doesn't mean I stopped caring about you.
Jackie, if you seriously don't want these, can I have them?
Look, mom, a good time to tell me you cared about me was the day daddy went to prison, not two months later on a postcard from la Cantina Cucaracha in Guadalajara.
Isn't it nice to get postcards?
Okay, fine.
Jackie, look, I know that you've got hostile feelings towards me, but I'm your mother, and I love you.
And I promise I'll never leave you again.
I believe her.
Me, too.
Kelso, you leave for the police academy tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing gasoline and matches so you can burn that one down, too?
I don't need gasoline to burn stuff down.
All I need is these two hands and a lack of adult supervision.
Anyway, I'm not going.
I decided I didn't want to be a cop.
But, Kelso, I thought you wanted to impress the mother of your child and give your life a purpose and pull over girls for speeding while foxy.
No, I got my reasons.
I mean, I don't want to leave when things are going so good for me and Brooke.
Plus, blue isn't a very good color for me.
What, are you crazy?
You take blue to a whole new level.
All right, let's go blast some cows.
Whoa.
All you talk about is being a cop.
You haven't focused on anything this hard since you thought you heard your name on "Led Zeppelin II".
It's in there.
In "Whole lotta love," he clearly sings, " Kelso lotta love".
Kelso, I'm gonna make sure you become a cop.
Yeah, we're not gonna let you throw your life away.
I don't care about that.
Look, I got a few things pending downtown, and I need someone on the inside.
Jackie, just go see your mom.
She chose you over golden sunsets, frozen margaritas.
Man, why aren't we down there?
Donna, you don't get her, because you'll never understand the intoxicating quality of getting anything you want with your looks.
Look, she's just here till she finds a new meal ticket.
I don't believe that for a minute.
I think she came back to be with you, not to find some lonely rich guy.
Your mother is a lovely woman.
Donna, Pam and I are gonna catch a movie.
It's my first American date in months.
Your mother is a gold-digging tramp.
I can't believe my mom is going out with your Bob of a dad.
Oh, what?
He's not good enough?
Oh, so you see it, too?
I expected her to go after a cool rich guy, like Jack Nicholson or a Bee Gee.
You're dad is cheesy and corny, like nachos.
Well, then no wonder your mom is after him.
She'll touch anything from Mexico!
Oh, hey, you take that back right now, or I will pull your hair really hard!
Oh, yeah.
Eric, not now.
Look, I'm sorry, Donna, but you cut me off, and I always thought it was lame when Kelso said that girl fights were sexy, but now I can see he was very right!
So you, hair pull, you, shirt rip.
You'd better go talk to your mom.
You'd better go talk to your dad.
Hmm.
I overplayed my hand there a little bit.
* Hey, come on, buddy.
Time to go to cop school.
I don't believe this.
I know.
King-size pillows on a twin-size bed.
Why didn't I think of that?
Man, he just split on us.
Ow!
yeah, he's definitely gone.
I guess we'll just leave then.
Oh, that's not fair.
You guys made leaving sounds.
Oh, come on, kitty.
Enough with the silent treatment.
I didn't say that I liked tea because Pam is pretty.
I said that I liked tea because you were kind enough and courageous enough to open my eyes to a whole new world of hot beverages, which is just one of the millions of things that you have done to improve my life over all these years.
So now I'm old.
Mr. Forman, will you please talk some sense into my dad?
Last night he went on a date with Jackie's mom.
Oh, you hear that, Red?
Looks like your girlfriend's stepn' out.
Donna, Pam's just what I've been looking for.
I've loved pretty women, and I've loved smart women.
And I'm going back to pretty.
Dad, don't you think it's a little suspicious that she just got back and she's already latched on to you?
I'm a very cute man, donna.
Bob, this is clearly upsetting Donna.
How can u date her?
Yeah, how can you date her?
What does that mean?
What?
You emphasized "her," like there's something special about her.
I just said what you said, but you must have missed it because I was on my way outside to mow the lawn.
Oh, man, I can't believe Donna is serious about this celibacy thing.
Fez, how do you cope with not getting any?
I think you know how I cope.
When you don't see me, I'm coping.
Hey, he tried to get away again.
So I had to use his stun gun on him.
Yeah, it didn't hurt, though.
I've done it to myself so many times, I baly feel it anymore.
Just get in the car.
You guys can take me to the academy, but as soon as you leave, I'm gone.
All right, Kelso, that's it.
I haven't had sex in weeks.
Fez is a drought not seen since the great dust bow, we are tightly wound.
So you'd better tell us what your real problem is, or we're gonna freakin' throttle you.
I will tear you apart like a lion.
Okay, look, I don't want to tell you guys, because I'm afraid you're gonna make fun of me.
Oh, Kelso, of course we're gonna make fun of you.
All right, fine.
You know what?
It's like I'm going to a new school, okay?
And I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to make friends.
First off, I'm so much better looking than everyone else.
The only reason you guys are friends with me is 'cause you met me before I blossomed.
Man, you should be worried about something that could actually happen, like handcuffing yourself to a horse.
Look, Kelso, here's the thing You've stolen my stuff, and you've burned my stuff, you've even groped my stuff.
But I still hang out with you because you are a great guy.
Come on, you're Michael Kelso, right?
You're bulletproof.
Damn it, you're right.
I am bulletproof.
All right, let's get going.
All right!
Hey, by the way, you're not actually bulletproof.
Where do you think you're going?
To the backyard.
Unh-unh, I'm going to the backyard.
Whatever.
Oh, don't give me that dirty look and say, "whatever".
That is my thing!
Oh, my God!
Hot tub!
Mom, what are you doing in there with that wet, hairy man?
And why are you wearing a white swimsuit?
It's winter!
Bobby and I are just having a soak.
Bobby?
When did we get a hot tub, Bobby?
Me and Pammy were out shopping, and I saw it, so I bought it.
Even got the good one with the euphoria jet.
I love it in here.
You know, if you put salt around the rim, it'd be like being in a giant margarita.
Hey, what the hell, right?
I have all this extra money, and Pammy here helped me spend some.
Yeah, that's her specialty.
Oh, you shut up about my mom.
Thank you, Jackie.
I wasn't defending you, ok?
This is just really weird.
Oh, can you both at least put your hands up where I can see them?
Enough, all right?
I like Pam, and she likes me.
We're both adults.
So if you two can't handle it, that's too bad.
Now go inside.
You're ruining our soak.
This soak is over.
Then we'll go inside.
Dad, are you naked?
How else am I gonna try the euphoria jet?
Okay, I know we both have different reasons for wanting our parents to stop seeing each other, like I hate your mom, and your mom's a tramp.
But we have to join forces and do everything we can to break them up.
I'm with you, Donna.
All the couples I've broken up before were just training till now.
This one's not for popularity or to make another girl cry.
It's for my beautiful mom and your mayonnaise-lovin' dad.
Ooh, how's it going, girls?
Not good.
We just saw Bob and Pam in a hot tub.
Bob and Pam are in a hot tub?
Pam's in a hot tub?
There.
You did it again.
And this time, you didn't even say "Bob".
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
And you would have heard it, too, if it hadn't been for all that damn tea.
You know, I fought a war to keep that crap out of this country, and you had to bring it into my house.
And you call yourself an American, huh?
ok.
I'm all set.
So here I go.
Kelso, you're gonna do great.
But, hey, just in case, I packed some extra cookies in your lunch to help you make friends.
Oh, um, I ate the cookies try to find a friend who likes carrots.
Ok.
Well Guess this is it.
Hey, give those cows hell, boys.
Hey, Kelso, I love you!
Shut up!
I love you, too, Kelso!
You guys, quit it!
I love you the most!
We were just kidding.
So was I. S-so was I. I can't believe there were no cows, man.
Yeah, what are we gonna do with all these bottle rockets?
Fine, I'll be the cow.
But this time, count all the way to ten.
You got it, buddy.
One.
Ten.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Well, you're awfully happy.
We're having a cocktail party.
What's not to be happy about?
Red, the last time we had a party, you called the cops and had them tow everyone's car.
Drunk people looking for their cars.
That was funny.
Oh, you're just giddy because Bob's bringing his pretty new girlfriend over.
Oh, Kitty, don't be ridiculous.
I'm just happy.
Now why do you want to ruin my happiness?
Because that's what a wife does.
You know, my dad dating your mom goes against all the laws of nature.
I mean, you don't see a giraffe with a panda bear.
You know, my dad being the cute, fuzzy panda bear, and your mom being the evil, money-hungry unnaturally tan giraffe.
Well, I've had it with them, too.
Last night your dad burped in front of my mom, and she laughed, Donna.
Laughed!
Okay, we're Burkharts.
We don't burp, and we don't tolerate people who do.
Hey, everybody, I brought a date.
Look how tall she is.
It's like I'm dating the statue of liberty.
Oh, Kitty, I just love coming over to your house.
You have such unique tastes.
It's like being at a giant flea market.
And like at every flea market, Bob's gonna leave with the tackiest thing here.
Pam, come on in.
I made your favorite drink Tequila sunrise.
Red, always the gentleman.
Yeah, well Red, Red, honey, where's my favorite drink?
I didn't know you had a favorite drink, Kitty, seeing as how much you like all drinks.
I'll take a drink, Red.
Beer's in the garage, Bob.
Mrs. Burkhart?
That's weird.
Golly, I didn't know you were dropping by.
Yeah, you did.
I told you she was, and you said, "oh, boy, I'm gonna wear my suit".
Well, I'm sorry, Donna.
Is there some kind of law against being handsome?
Because if there is, then guilty as charged.
Mrs. Burkhart, when did you get here?
Is it too much for you people to let me know that we have company?
One bronzed-up tart in the room, and all the men turn into a bunch of oversexed fraternity boys.
Kitty, you're just imagining things.
What's she wearing?
Oh, I cannot believe you kids, trying to sneak off with my good gin.
Yeah, I shoulda known.
She can smell booze from a mile away.
Excuse me?
Oh, I said, "you smell like booze from a mile away".
That's worse, dumb-ass!
Oh, what a lovely evening.
if I didn't know any better, I'd swear I was with rich people.
She's got it all Looks and beauty.
Pam, you want another drink?
Honey, you shouldn't be drinking.
You have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
He has a heart condition.
He's very old.
I never thought I'd say this, but I wish I was Bob.
I wonder if she'd like to watch "the graduate" with me some night.
One time back when I was dating Jackie, Pam was trying to wash her car, right, and she leaned over and, like, squeezed out the sponge.
That's all I remember, cause I rode my bike straight into a tree.
Oh, look at her.
Would you ever want me to show that much leg?
Absolutely not.
And why not?
You set me up.
Jackie, I can't see your mom's hand, which means it's on my dad's butt.
We have to break 'em up.
I've been bad-mouthing Pinciottis for years.
I can be one.
So that's when I realized that "tapas" sounds a lot like "topless".
But I had already promised, so Hey, mrs.
Burkhart, why don't I throw on some music for us to, uh Shake our booties to?
Hey, stop acting like an ass in front of the pretty lady.
That's ok, Red.
I think he's cute.
Yeah, well, he is my son, you know.
Well, good party, good party.
When Pam and I were dancing, she, uh, "accidentally" brushed my butt.
And tell 'em what happened after that.
Well, then I said, "hey, you can squeeze my butt anytime".
And then it got really quiet.
And then she walked over to Bob, and they were talking and pointing at me.
Then you tried to laugh it off, and you spit dip up on your shirt.
Then you tried to do that joke where you scoop the dip off your shirt with a chip, and none laughed, and here we are.
You know, there's a lot of talk about Pam, but, Eric, I still have feelings for your mom.
I mean, she comes off all pure, but she's dirty.
Why can't my dad just see that Pam is a total gold digger?
Oh, would you stop saying that?
Hey, either she digs for gold or she doesn't.
It's easy to check.
Are her boots muddy?
Does she carry a pickax?
When she comes home does she say, "tough day at the gold mine"?
No, Fez, a gold digger is what these idiots call a woman who knows that love eventually wears off, but money is forever.
You guys, all I know is pretty tan lady touched my butt.
And that is more action than I've gotten in weeks.
Keep it up, and you'll be having sex with yourself.
I mean, how does Bob pull all these foxes like Midge and Pam?
He's got to have something the ladies can't resist.
Hey, Donna, you ever see your dad naked?
My God!
Can we please talk about anything besides that?
You're way off, Hyde.
Women love Bob for his sense of humor.
That sucker's funnier than a dixie cup.
No.
All right, how it works is relationships are based on a point system.
All right, see, Pam is good looking.
So that's 20 points.
And Bob, he's, like, the nicest guy in the world, so that's, like, what, a point?
But Bob's got money, and that's 19 points.
And altogether, that's 20.
Now you add the whole thing together, and that's 40, Which is incidentally almost half my score.
?
I don't care what that doctor says.
I'm not wearing this stupid heart monitor.
It makes me look like a damn robot.
Red, I'm sure you won't even know it's there.
It'll only beep if your heart rate goes above normal, like when you get agitated or excited or extra angry or extra happy.
I'm putting my money on extra angry.
I bet the damn thing doesn't even work.
You know what, Red?
Your attitude stinks.
You wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just listened to me in the first place.
Kitty I told you to eat more fiber in the mornings.
I told you to exercise, to wear more comfortable shoes for circulation.
Did you listen?
No.
So I guess I'm just gonna keep telling you and telling you and telling you.
What do you know?
It does work.
?
Hey, I can't believe you guys aren't in Bob's hot tub.
You know, I feel like Warren Beatty in a movie about a hot tub.
He's, like, hot tubbin', then, like Other stuff happens.
Kelso, just so you know, Bob was in there an hour ago, so you are, like, covered in hot, bubbly Bob.
Dad, will you please listen to us?
We talked about it, and we really think you need to break up with Pam.
No way.
Open your eyes!
Everyone can see what a big mistake this is.
Oh, so everyone here thinks I should just break up with Pam?
I say stick with her, Bob.
My only advice is take pictures, otherwise no one's gonna believe you.
Don't listen to him.
He grew up poor.
He's stupid.
What do you think, Eric?
Yeah, Eric, what do you think?
I hope it's the right answer.
You love that woman for all she's worth, Bob!
Eric!
What are you gonna do, cut me off from sex again?
I agree with Forman, Bob.
I think you should keep her.
I mean, you're you, and you're getting me-quality girls.
You're living life Kelso-style.
Enjoy.
Oh, I am so sorry I'm late.
I locked my keys in the car, and I had to use a coat hanger to jimmy the lock.
I had to reach down in there, and I had to shimmy and shimmy and shimmy until the darn thing finally popped open.
Boy, I'm sorry I missed that.
Yeah, could act it out for us one more time?
Look, mom, Donna and I decided that you two can't see each other anymore.
We're your children, and we love you, but your happiness is much less important than ours.
Jackie, when your dad went away to jail, I decided to do some work on myself.
Not on the outside, obviously, because, well, come on.
But on the inside, you know, the part that doesn't matter as much.
And I've realized that I need a man who makes me feel good about myself.
I need you Bob.
Aww, you know, if an ugly woman said that, it just wouldn't mean as much.
Man, if this was a movie, Pam would pick up Bob and just carry him off to a better life.
If this were a good movie, Pam would have entered the scene topless.
Yeah, if this were a great movie, they'd have a monkey friend that did all this crazy stuff.
You know what?
You guys were no help.
You could have backed us up.
And you could be sleeping with me.
People could be doing a lot of things.
All right, I'm done peeing.
Hey, can you hand me my clothes?
Kelso, are you naked?
No.
Eric, could you hand me my clothes, please?
I'm sorry, buddy.
I can't hear you over the hot tub.
Did you hear him, Hyde?
I think so.
I think he said to take his clothes and run away.
Oooh.
Guys, guys, come back!
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to be nude in front of you guys, and that's kind of awkward.
So I think you ladies should nude up.
?
Okay, good news, Red.
I made your favorite lunch Lasagna!
Thanks.
"thanks"?
Aren't you excited?
Let's hear that monitor!
So every time you do something nice for me, I'm supposed to have a heart attack?
Well, no, not an attack.
Just a little episode.
Ha ha ha ha!
I mean, what does it take to get that beeper going?
Hi, Red.
Wow, that must be the lasagna kicking in.
Hey, what do you say we have some more of that lasagna?
Boy, was that delicious.
Beep!
Beep!
Beep!
Oh, can it, Red.
When Pam showed up, your heart monitor went off like a freakin' slot machine.
Pam had nothing to do with that thing going off, Damn it!
Oh, and look at us now.
We're arguing.
Can't even get a beep out of you.
Your son is a jerk.
Come on, I am gonna prove to you that I am not attracted to Pam.
Hey, guys.
I think I'm having a war flashback.
I'm messed up, Kitty.
I'm real messed up.
I cannot believe you told my dad to stay with Pam.
She doesn't even like you.
She told my dad you groped her at the party.
Okay, look, Donna, you and Pam obviously have some serious issues.
I think you two should work them out with a good old-fashioned pillow fight.
Come on, Jackie, I think maybe you should throw on a nightgown and defend your mom.
You're sick.
And, you, you were no help either.
Hey, I was just agreeing with Forman, so he didn't look so bad.
You said it before he did.
Oh, yeah What's the big deal?
Bob and Pam are adults who want to do what comes naturally to everybody except me.
So I say, why can't I get any?
You know, Pam wants to be with my dad now, but what happens when someone else comes along?
I wouldn't care so much if I could just, you know, test her with a hotter guy and see if she falls for him.
Because I love you, I'll do it.
Why would you do it?
This is a man's job.
Don't wait up for me, baby.
Ohh!
No, it has to be someone her type.
Well, I know from her time in Mexico that she has a weakness for young, dark-skinned guys.
I guess I can ask around.
Mmm, that smells delicious.
What is it?
It's not for you.
You can go look for scraps around the neighborhood like the rest of the dogs.
Kitty, for the last time, I am not attracted to Pam.
Please, believe me, as the husband who has shared your laughter and tears for Many happy years.
How many years, Red?
All of 'em.
You can't give me a number, can you?
Well, I can tell you on a scale of one to ten, I love you ten.
That's a number.
Oh, why don't you just take your cardiac jukebox over to Pam's?
Hi, Kitty.
Hi, Red.
I thought we'd come over and see if you two wanted to catch a movie.
Why are you staring?
Too pretty for Wisconsin?
I get that a lot.
You shut it off, didn't you?
No, I did not shut it off!
Let's hustle it up.
I don't want to sit behind people with hats.
Ha!
Look at that, nosey!
It's not Pam.
It's Bob, because he annoys me.
That's true.
I do.
What are you guys talking about?
Um Ha ha ha ha!
I, um, I sort of thought that Red had a crush on you.
Oh, Kitty, I'm sorry.
This face can bring as much trouble as it does joy.
Well, Kitty, what do you have to say for yourself?
It's the menopause.
I'm messed up, Red.
I'm real messed up.
?
Um, hello.
What are you doing?
I was hired to clean the hot tub.
But you should know that I, uh Perform other services, too.
Well, you could start by doing a better job.
It's still dirty.
So you like it dirty?
No, I want it clean.
So you like it filthy?
Bob!
Whoa, I'm not into that!
No.
Hey, Eric, that was a good burn stealing my clothes.
But the laugh's on you, 'cause I borrowed your pants, and I'm not wearing any underwear.
Kelso, just so you know, the last time I wore those pants, I wasn't wearing any underwear.
Ouch.
Well-played.
Where the hell is Fez?
He should have been back by now.
Oh, I swear, if he touched my mother inappropriately, he is never borrowing my curling iron again.
Man, first I wanted to be Bob.
Now I wish I was Fez.
What the hell is going on this week?
Ahem.
Did you tell Fez to make a move on Pam?
'cause if you didn't, I'm gonna box him up and send him back to banana town.
Okay, I'm sick of those comments.
I don't say I'm gonna send you back to polyester town.
Dad, I'm really sorry.
It was just the only thing we could think of to prove that Pam doesn't, you know, really care about you.
Well, guess what.
She does really care about me, so you can stop playing these little games, because Pam makes me happier than I have been in a long time.
You better accept it soon, 'cause she's here to stay.
That's right.
I will have my pretty lady.
This Bob is back.
Way to go, Bob!
I love you, man!
Bob, you're just like me.
We give regular guys hope.
You can't leave Pam, because Because Pam's your Donna.
Steven, am I your Donna?
That doesn't apply to us.
We're both good-looking.
Dad, can we at least talk about this?
I'm sorry, Donna.
That's the way it's gonna be.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Should've known this wasn't gonna work.
Foreigners never finish the job.
Oh, please, if Bob hadn't shown up, I'd be your stepdaddy right now.
B-7.
Miss.
Oh, man, how do I keep missing you?
It's 'cause I don't have any boats on there.
What's that noise?
It's my dad's heart monitor.
Where's your mom?
She's with him.
Oh, take off the beeper!
Other people live here!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
So..
That is all for the pictures of my mom in Cancún when she abandoned me Now let's move on to my mom in Acapulco when she abandoned me.
God, I cannot believe how good your mom looks in a bikini.
I mean, she's approaching, like, meterritory.
Isn't the bikini a marvelous invention?
Imagine the first Aztec who said, "I just gotta see some more belly button," you know?
Yeah, the Mexicans are such a resourceful people.
Eric, don't be so stupid.
Everyone knows the French invented the bikini.
The Mexicans just added on the top 'cause they're catholic.
Another good example of religion dividing instead of uniting.
Does anyone want a soda?
- Yeah.
- Please.
And F.Y.I., If God wanted Mexican women to wear tops, he wouldn't have created tequila.
Where the hell's Eric with our sodas?
Eric!
Maybe he ran home.
He's kind of a mama's boy.
Eric.
Oh, my god!
I'm busy!
Oh, my god!
Ew!
Was he going to the bathroom?
Non !
That 70's Show - Saison 6 Episode 17 "Happy Jack" Merci à RaceMan  Ok, ok, ok..
something happened, and, uh, I think it's safe to say that it was certainly in the area of horrific.
Like war or when my mom sings "do you think I'm sexy"?
While she vacuums.
What happened?
Well, we all know that as a young man in the prime of his life, I have some needs.
Amen, brother.
Wait a minute.
This is the prime of your life?
You live at home with your mommy, and you have to wear a name tag at work.
Anyway, uh today at the house of the woman that I was theoretically going to marry, I had some needs that I felt it necessary to take care of right then and there.
In her house?
Why don't you do it at the bus station like the other degenerates?
It's..
I..
you know, I don't know.
There I was.
There the bathroom was.
It was like two trains passing in the night.
That's beautiful.
You know, it kinda was.
And then Donna walked in.
- Oh, my god!
- She didn't!
I can't believe we're gonna visit Kelso at the Police Academy this weekend.
We're gonna miss the best part, when he makes the whole thing worse.
How could I make this worse?
I don't know.
Man, it seems impossible, but you always find a way.
You're like the little engine who could of screwing yourself.
You know what?
This is Donna's fault, with her, you know, no more sex till we're married crap.
You guys have no idea how hard it's been to have no sex at all.
Yeah, it must be horrible.
Seriously, you guys, what do I do now?
I say you gotta pull a Nixon.
Deny, deny, deny.
No, you just need a good story.
Whenever I get caught, I just tell people that I'm checking for ticks.
Fez, how many times you been caught?
Oh, come on, I'm not stopping just because a doorknob turns.
Whoo, man, look at these jokers.
Can't believe this is who Kelso hangs out with now.
If he doesn't dunk one of these heads in a toilet bowl, I'm buying him a skirt.
Fellas.
It's good to see you boys.
What the hell is that?
Oh, the 'stache.
Yeah, it's coming in nice, huh?
That's why the call the fuzz "the fuzz".
They're covered in fuzz.
Like someone threw paint on the "Mona Lisa".
Oh, please, Michael Kelso is a masterpiece.
You know it.
I know it.
Yeah, about that-- I'm going by "Mike" now.
It's my cop name.
But we call you "Kelso".
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to ask you to call me Mike!
As far as the 'stache goes, I like it.
Makes me look like an authority figure.
Makes you look like a porn star.
Either way.
Cadet Mike.
Officer Kennedy, you know my friends Hyde and Fez.
Yeah, I remember.
But it seems to me their names were trouble and maker.
"Trouble" and "maker".
That's clever.
I think it's funny.
They put us together, and we're troublemakers.
Shut up.
I hope these two delinquents don't interfere with the progress you've been making here, Mike.
No, sir.
Not at all, sir.
Well, we'll see.
I'll have my eye on you on all of you.
He's a good man.
All right, you're really starting to creep me out.
Help me grab the beer out of the car.
I'm gonna drink until that mustache turns into a caterpillar and crawls away.
Sorro can do.
I got K.P. In the A.M. And P.T. In the P.M. Well, I don't know what any of that means, but I came here to drink beer and play with guns, damn it.
Sorry, buddy, but we got lights out at 22 hundsky, so I'm gonna have to ask you to move along to the barracks A.S.A.P.
Did you just call me a "sap" ?
"ASAP" as soon as possible.
Well, you're a sap right now.
Okay, the thing is, I knew Eric did that, but knowing and seeing..
are two very different things.
It's kind of like how I know there are rats under the house.
But you don't want to see the rats diddling themselves in your bathroom.
Exactly !
But, Donna, you're missing the whole point here.
Eric's perverted behavior can be a card you can play for the rest of your life.
Let's just say you want Eric to buy you a diamond, but he says no.
You just say, "why, are you busy"?
Five minutes later, you're Elizabeth Taylor.
Yeah, I think I need advice from a woman in a relationship not built on blackmail.
It's called a lesbian, Donna, and you're gonna have to go to New York for that.
This afternoon a cadet named Terry hit on me, and it makes me nervous when men with guns like me.
Fez, cadet Terry is a woman.
I know because I saw her putting cover-up on her chin hair.
Well, then, hello there, cadet Terry.
I will sit here, but I will not partake.
What you're doing is illegal, and it could cause my mind to drift off its main goal, which is enforcing the law.
Now I'd like you both to read some literature.
In particular, let's take a look at "be great and go straight".
I think that one really says it all.
Hey, do not throw the literature!
Kelso..
the fact that you're now totally lame would make me furious if I had the ability to feel anger right now, which I thankfully don't.
I am not lame.
I am grown-up.
And when you grow up, you play by the rules, which is why I am getting rid of this.
What is he doing?
WHAT IS HE DOING ?
Don't worry, Fez.
He's just screwing around.
What?
Baggie!
Oh, no, he has broken you.
You broke Hyde, you son of a bitch!
So do you get what I'm saying?
I think so.
He was busy?
In my house!
I raised him better than that!
I know this is weird, but I don't have anyone else to talk to.
Really, did you call around?
I could give you some numbers.
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
Ok Okay, you and Eric need to be able to talk about this.
I'm sure it'll be awkward at first, but, well, then I am afraid it's just going to be awkward all the way through.
So do you and red have these kinds of conversations?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, we don't talk about stuff like this.
Red can't even be naked in a room with a mirror.
Right.
Well, I'm sure Eric and I will be able to talk about this like we talk about everything, because that's what you do.
In an open, mature relationship, you face things head on.
- Oh, god.
- Dirty!
Kelso, let us in.
No, you're gonna hit me again.
I'm warning you, I got a C+ in billy club.
just open the door!
Non.
Damn, it's unlocked.
I guess I'm gonna have to take you out.
That's a nice move.
Kelso, just relax.
Now listen, we went on a walk.
We realized you're trying to start a new life for yourself here.
We should be supportive.
Really ?
Thank you.
No, thank you, buddy.
We're gonna be great and go straight.
You ready?
You bet I am.
Let's see you do Q.T. In the K.P. With this, you S.O.B. Morning.
Well, if it isn't casanova, the man who seduced himself.
Oh, god.
All right, hold it, hold it.
Come back here.
Red, be nice.
Eric, don't be embarrassed.
Now you know that you can talk to us about anything, so so come on.
Let's rap.
When you were a baby, you had your hands down your pants all the time.
But that's okay, because it's natural.
Red, tell him it's natural.
What are you, an animal?
But why wouldn't you lock the door?
How could he lock the door when he's in there pawing himself like an animal?
You know, some people get addicted and can't even hold down a job!
If you can't get someone to do it for you, you do without.
In korea I went for two and a half years.
Dad, you were there for three.
What are you, an animal?
hey.
Oh, hey.
Hey, why'd you knock?
You know why I knocked.
Eric, you've been avoiding me all day.
Let's just talk about this.
There's nothing to talk about.
You obviously thought you saw something that you didn't see.
I was checking for ticks.
- Eric!
- Fine, okay, fine.
I got caught.
I'm embarrassed.
Let's put this behind us.
I love you.
Okay, great.
It's behind us.
Absolutely.
Um, I said, "I love you".
Don't you love me, too?
Sure, you know.
Whatever.
Can I have a hug?
Fine.
It's just, what got you going at my house?
I mean, we were just sitting around looking at pictures of Jackie's mom.
Jackie's mom got you going?
No!
What?
No!
- Well - oh!
You're an animal!
I can't wait for these guys to see Kelso.
I think I might be giddy.
I know.
I feel like it's Christmas morning, except instead of toys, we get to humiliate a close friend.
Hey, Pete.
Hey, Doug.
Hiya, boys.
- Hi, Mike!
- Hi, Mike!
Cadet Mike, I suppose you think this is funny.
What, You have made a mockery of the uniform, and I want an explanation right now.
Shut up!
Dismissed!
What did you guys do to me?
Did you shave my head?
Is there something on my back?
You know what?
You guys are totally stuck in high school.
I'm trying to do something better.
You guys resent it.
You're trying to ruin it for me.
You know what?
This stuff isn't even funny anymore.
Oh, that's a good burn!
So that's when I was, like, "no, I don't want highlights".
People pay money to get their hair my color, not the other way around.
Why are we feeding you again?
'Cause I'm good company.
Look who tore himself away from himself long enough to join us.
Yeah, usually he's too busy for lunch.
All right, both of you stop.
Honey, you washed your hands, right?
Look, dad, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but can I talk to you in private for a moment?
No, I don't think so.
I know the kind of things you do in private.
- Dad - oh, all right.
Just keep your hands where I can see 'em.
This really isn't getting old.
Ok so you know how I do things that are horrible, and it seems like I can't make them any worse, and then I do?
Sadly, yes.
Well I did it again.
Again?
How many bathrooms does that house have?
- No, not not that.
Uh, Donna wanted to talk about the horrible thing.
Oh!
They always want to talk about it.
Yeah, well, we talked about it.
And in the course of talking about it, information was revealed that made it much much worse.
And that is why you never, ever talk about it.
Have you ever noticed how often I just grunt at your mother?
I know how to talk.
I'm not an ape.
Right.
I just choose not to.
Right.
Well, it's too latefor that now since you screwed up and talked about it.
There's only one thing to do.
Go on the offensive.
Counter attack.
What?
That's suicide, man.
They'll never expect it.
It throws 'em off.
You know, one time in Korea, we had this little guy outnumbered 20 to 1.
But then he ran at us screaming his head off.
And we were so taken off guard, that we dove right into our foxholes.
- And he got away?
- No, no.
No, I mean we were startled for a few seconds, but then the whole company just opened up on him.
Listen up, Donna.
I got something to say.
Okay, but be careful.
Jackie's mom was here earlier.
I don't want you to catch a whiff of her perfume and have to sexually assault yourself in the hallway.
No, no, no, no.
I talk.
You listen.
Okay,this is all your fault.
Yeah, do you have any idea what your celibacy thing is doing to me?
My needs have risen to near..
Fezian levels.
He is a sick bastard, Donna, and now, thanks to you, so am I!
Yeah, that's right, Donna!
You created a monster.
I can't leave myself alone!
You know what?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
You are?
I mean, um yeah, damn right you are.
No, this has been really hard, and this celibacy thing was my idea, so I need to accept some responsibility for the odd and disgusting things you do.
That's right, you do.
But, you know, next time, be like a normal person.
Go to your room, lock the door, light some candles, put on some Al Green and make an evening of it.
Wow, Donna, that was really detailed.
It's almost like oh, my god.
You do it, too!
What ?
no, no!
I noticed the candles getting lower, even though I'd never seen them lit!
All right, this conversation is over!
Wow So this is where it all happens.
So they make an evening of it?
Yeah, candles, music.
God, girls do everything better.
You don't suppose Jackie nah, she won't even go to a self-serve gas station.
What would happen if I walked in during one of their evenings?
Are they like us where even though we're alone, we welcome a visitor?
It's not like they'd rather do it themselves, when they could have a man do it, right?
- Yeah.
- Right.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, Donna, when we register for our wedding, could we register for a trampoline?
My mom won't let me have a trampoline.
If I'd known about registering when I married Laurie, I would have registered for a wife who wants to have sex with me.
Eric, you know, people only register for stuff that's used in serving, eating and clearing of a meal.
Why is it always about eating?
Because marriage signifies the end of trying to be attractive.
Man, registering sucks.
I had to register with Jackie for her sweet 16.
Longest five months of my life.
Look, all I know is you guys are gonna buy whatever wedding present we tell you, and none of this all-going-in- on-one-gift crap.
Hey, hey, shut it, huh?
No talk about weddings.
Jackie's on her way over.
She's not here now.
She doesn't have to hear the word "wedding".
She can sense that it was said.
I wish I could do that.
But not so much with words, but so that I could see through people's clothes.
Look, you two start yapping about your wedding, Jackie gets all, "Steven, when are we getting married"?
Then I have to say, "we're not getting married," and she kicks me in my shins.
From the knees down, I'm like a frickin' P.O.W. No, you have magnificent legs.
I would say W.O.W. Wow.
May I help oh, it's you.
Hello, Fenton.
You two know each other?
Yeah, this is the weirdo who sold me your ring.
He's probably worn it more than you, so maybe she doesn't want to wear it because it's from you.
Well, maybe you need to keep your nose outta my business!
Trust me, your business is the last place I want to put my nose!
I'm sorry, man.
Me too.
Yeah.
We're here to register for our wedding.
Oh, wonderful.
And I see we're starting with silverware.
Yes, I like this one.
No, Eric, the wedding book says we can't pick the first thing we see.
Oh, well, in that case, yeah, the first one, eh.
Second one, whoo-hoo!
All right.
Let's wrap it up, hit the food court.
Here's a small sampling from our collection-- prestige, exhilaration, and, oh, my personal favorite, brash.
Ooh.
Well, Fenton, you may be surprised to learn that your personal favorite is not our personal favorite.
But, anyway, we're done.
No, Eric, the wedding book says that we have to look at all the patterns.
Today is just a scouting trip.
Scouting?
You know, I was asked to resign from the scouts.
Look, it's kind of like okay, remember before we were together and we dated, like, all those different people before we decided on each other?
No, not really.
No.
Eric, come on.
This is supposed to be fun.
Okay, look at the groom in this picture.
What is the difference between you and him?
Um, he's a cartoon?
No, he is smiling.
Yeah, because he's a cartoon.
Look, these are all the forks I have here.
I'll have to bring the rest up from storage.
I guess I'll need a forklift.
Oh.
whoo.
Oh, I made a funny.
well, it's A it's a good thing we have all day.
All day?
Wh-- I'm not spending all day in a department store.
I'm gonna turn into him.
Okay, um, you're not as far away as you think.
Okay, that's it.
I'm going to the sporting goods department.
Hmm, men.
You can't live with 'em well, you can.
But you have to keep quiet about it.
That 70's show S06E18 Hangin' out That 70's show S06E18 down the street the same old thing that you did last week not a thing to do but talk to you we're all all right Hello, Wisconsin!
Reading another one of your dirty girl books?
They're not dirty, they're romantic.
"Mutiny from behind".
Yeah.
The mutiny sneaks up on her.
I don't think that's what it means.
Well, it is a wonderful book.
It's got pirates and action.
Oh, oh, oh!
It has this hilarious parrot that says the most inappropriate things.
"The pirate's vessel "slowly sailed into the harbor of San Sebastian island.
"His saucy prisoner's alabaster breasts "heaving with every motion "of the tall, rigid ship".
San Sebastian island.
I think I killed some commies there.
I just spent six hours registeringfor wedding gifts.
The only reason I'm here now is I pretended to choke on ice cream.
I'll let you in on a little secret for when you're shopping with women.
Always pick the ugliest, worst choice, and you're off the hook.
That's how I got out of shopping for this couch.
There was an uglier couch than this?
The one I picked had dragons on it.
Wow, you're sneaky.
You know, you act like you're all about brute force, but you're a finesse player, man.
Trust me, son.
Don't budge until you hear the magic words, "oh, I'll justdo it myself".
You're done registering already?
You men, you just don't know how to shop.
You know, your father once tried to get me to buy a couch with dragons on it.
Yeah I guess I'm just bad at it.
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans, babe what do you think of this fork?
Donna, I think all this stuff is too ordinary for us, you know?
Let's get something bejeweled.
Who are you--liberace?
Yes.
I'm liberace.
Eric, this wedding is - Hey guys.
What's up?
Oh, hey.
We were just talking about slutty cheerleaders in other schools.
You never want to talk about that.
Well, I've finally come around, darling.
Oh!
Are those wedding gift catalogs?
- Damn it.
For our wedding, Steven and I - Jackie, no.
- Steven, we have to - No.
- A good bride and groom - That's it.
You're done.
Now why didn't someone do that five years ago?
She used to bite.
Now this, okay, This is what I'm talking about.
That's a nice fork.
Eric, the handle is an actual deer hoof.
Yeah, that's the cherokee collection.
Donna, that's the indian way.
They kill the animal, then eat it with its own paw.
Okay, you know what?
I have a new plan.
I'll just go shopping, and then I'll show you what I pick.
So I don't get to go at all?
Um, no.
I'll just I'll just do it by myself.
Yeah I guess I'm just bad at it.
"After throwing the evil pirate king overboard, "the Duke turned to Lady Daphne, "pulled his sword from its sheath "and held it erect.
"Lady Daphne touched it tentatively, "and a shudder went through the duke".
So you like those books, too, mr.
Red.
All right, fine.
So you know.
But you tell one person, and so help me god, I will chop down whatever tree you live in.
So I was day dreaming during this civil rights lecture at the Police Academy, and I came up with a great idea for an invention.
"Adult strollers".
Why walk when someone can push you?
Kelso, that's a wheel chair.
All right, it's official.
Everything's been thought of!
All right, what do you think of this fork?
Whoa.
No, no, no,no, no, no, no.
You're not gonna rope me into that.
Just make Eric do it.
No, Eric's banned from doing it.
He actually wanted me to eat dinner with Bambi's foot.
What is this, the cherokee collection?
Oh, well, he picked the ugliest one so you wouldn't make him go shopping.
It's classic.
I knew something was fishy.
He's terrified of indians.
Oh, he's gonna pay for this.
He thought he had a bad time the other day?
He doesn't know what a bad time is.
I am gonna stop having sex with him.
Oh, crap, I already did that.
All right, look, I hate to sell him out, but the poor kid lacks subtlety.
He's Eric's how do I putoh, he's a bit of a rube.
You know, like, a little country.
A maroon, if you will.
Kelso, what's your point?
Well, I'm just saying you could do better.
I mean, I'm here, you're here.
Nobody has to know.
- Kelso!
- Okay, fine, you can tell two friends.
So I invested $11 in Kelso's adult stroller idea.
I'm going to be a millionaire.
Really?
So, uh, if I buy one, like, who's gonna push me around?
Trained bears.
Kelso's got it all figured out.
I'm just the money man.
Hey, guys, where's Donna?
I found this place that etches your silhouette on your china.
Oh, we are so doing that when we get married.
Steven, people can eat right off my face.
Then guess who's coming to dinner.
Jackie, you're driving me insane.
Look, I want you to make me a promise.
You will not talkabout weddings or anything wedding-related in or around The United States.
Fine, I won't talkabout weddings or anything wedding-related in or around the Continental United States.
Not the Continental United States.
We're talking Hawaii and Alaska, too.
Fine, but if we're ever in Canada, I am going nuts!
Eric, bad news.
A deejay at the radio station got sick, so I have to cover his shift all week.
I'm not gonna be able to register for wedding gifts.
Oh, no.
Well, I guess we'll just have to live with whatever forks come in the mail willy-nilly.
Well, actually, you're gonna have to shop for everything.
- Wait, wait.
Back up here.
Who are you calling willy-nilly?
Look, uh, Donna, I can't shop.
I have horrible taste, remember?
"I guess I'm just bad at it".
You are almost unbelievably bad at it.
And that's why I've decided Jackie will go shopping with you.
- Ohh!
Yay!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You promised Hyde that you wouldn't do any more wedding stuff.
Yeah, but here's the thing about me.
I lie.
So today we'll be looking at crystal.
You see how all the different colors intermingle without any judgment?
Hmm, see that?
Yeah, okay, move over, Tony Randall.
I'm in charge.
Today we'll be looking at china.
I see you let the redhead go.
I can't say I'm an expert on women, but I think you traded up.
Okay, I will lay out four possible choices.
You will then choose your favorite.
I will disregard that and choose the correct one.
So what will ibe doing?
Oh, you will be holding my purse and eating candy.
All right.
Here, make the sugar daddy last.
Oh, if only someone had given me that advice four years ago.
This spice rack is a real mess.
It's like someone got drunk and put everything out of order.
I mean, cayenne pepper,cumin, celery salt?
It's insanity.
Oh, Duke, I'd like to show you my coconuts.
Well, give me a minute to raise my mast, and then we can really make some waves.
Not so fast!
If anyone's making waves around here, it's me.
I'm trained in judo, hapkido and karate.
I can also talk about you behind your back.
When it gets back to you, it'll really sting.
So prepare to die.
Aah!
You know, Kitty, Eric's not home.
We have the whole upstairs to ourselves.
Woulda been thinking about that the whole time.
Okay.
I got another invention.
Bicycles with engines.
That's a motorcycle.
Okay, fine.
Bicycles without engines.
That's a bicycle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's got the chair on it.
And we're back to wheelchair.
Okay, Eric just called, and he's having fun shopping.
All right, with me, it's torture, but when I send him to pick out wedding gifts with J Pick out wedding gifts with who?
Um Jehoshaphat.
Remember him from school?
He was always you know, jumping.
You sent Forman out to do wedding stuff with Jackie?
Look, I had to punish him, and what better way than to make him spend the day with Jackie?
Yeah, she's got you there.
I mean, your girlfriend is annoying.
Plus, I used to do it with her all the time.
So that's gotta hurt.
Man, I thought I had this wedding crap taken care of.
Now I gotta go down to the mall.
Ah, and "Three's Company" is about to start.
This day's gone all to hell!
What happened to my favorite blouse?
A lady never talks about what happens in the bedroom.
Ah, looks like Red picked up some tricks from the Duke in "Mutiny From Behind".
He read my dirty girl book?
Yes, I caught him.
Ironically, from behind.
See, Eric, this is the perfect tux for you.
It makes you look like you actually have shoulders.
You know, i do look like I have shoulders.
- Mm-hmm.
Why are you wearing a wedding dress?
Oh, I do this every week.
What the hell?
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.
- I know.
Look, shoulders.
Eric, this was supposed to be our time.
Donna, wait.
Okay, Steven, I know I promised I wouldn't do any wedding stuff, and I know you're probably really mad, so just go ahead and yell.
- You're beautiful.
Oh, my god.
You like me in a wedding dress, which means that someday,we're gonna get married, which means that i can talk about it.
Oh, Steven!
Okay, I want a spring wedding, outside with white doves.
And I want the sun to be setting behind me so I have a halo, kind of like an angel.
Oh, and then wild mustangs can take us to our honeymoon in Hawaii!
Oh, but your family can't come.
Oh, you know what?
You can run, but you can't hide.
I know where you live!
Donna what's the matter?
You picked a deer-foot fork just to get out of shopping with me.
Oh, too obvious, huh?
Yeah, no one wants hairy silverware.
I just don't understand how you could have more fun with Jackie than with me.
I don't know.
I mean, you know, she doesn't ask me questions.
She just tells me what to do.
It's a strange kind of freedom, but I know why the caged bird sings, Donna.
So you're saying the way to handle you is just take away your free will and order you around?
- Donna, that's the way I was raised.
Eric, I can't tell you what to do because I don't even know what to do.
I mean, that's why I got that stupid book.
I hate that book.
Kelso was right.
Reading just gets you into trouble.
Forks don't matter to me, Eric.
I mean, they don't.
They don't.
In 20 years, food's just gonna be a little pill anyway.
Look, let's just do this whole wedding thing our way.
Yes.
What's our way?
I don't know.
Maybe we should ask jackie.
You're back with that one?
Good luck.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Ooh, yeah.
So yesterday, I'm at this garage sale, I look down, and there it was the Darth Vader action figure with the incredibly rare greenlightsaber.
How have I not kicked your ass yet?
- Fore!
- Whoa!
- Watch out!
- Parking lot!
oh, it was just a Pinto.
Fez, this is putt-putt.
Your choices are putt or putt.
Hey, what the hell?
Oh, Forman.
I should have known it was you guys.
Most people that come here can't hit the ball that hard on account of they're in kindergarten.
Mitch, Congratulations.
This seems like the perfect job for someone your size, what with the free lodging and the little castle on hole 6.
Yeah, there's just enough room in there for me and your mom.
Ooh!
Yeah, the sweetest burns involve doing it with your mom.
Look, just quit hitting the ball that hard, or you guys are outta here.
What are you no.
God, I hate that guy.
Tear him a new hole-in-one.
Wow, Forman, I haven't seen you this pissed since I chased you around your house with that spider in a jar.
You were like, "Hyde, I swear to god"!
Then you never did anything.
Yeah?
I'm about to do something.
Saison 6 - Episode 19 - No, can't do that.
Mitch, I'm so sorry.
What?
I've lost the ability to process language on account of I have a concussion!
Here's more bad news when you return to the course, you're gonna find that some punk drew boobs and a butt crack on the clown statue.
And don't try to wash it off 'cause I used permanent marker.
Forman, why are we always fighting?
I can't even remember how we got this way.
I think a chick said that to me once.
No, that was me.
Don't you think that we should be friends?
Okay, well, you..
you're obviously having some kind of reaction to your medications.
We're just gonna go.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
You know, Mitch, if you ever want to come hang out in the basement, you know really?
Thanks!
I'd smile, but the left side of my face is kind of paralyzed.
Forman, why'd you invite him over?
You were almost out of there, and you turned back around.
Yeah, Forman, there's only two times in life that you turn back around basketball and runway modeling.
No, and square dancing.
It's called a do-si-do.
Look Mitch knows I didn't mean it.
Hey, Eric.
I can't believe you got a hold of the Darth Vader with the green lightsaber.
What?
No, no, it's..
what a geek.
Wow, I love this place.
It's not just dinner.
It's a thrill ride, 'cause there's a small chance you're gettin' knifed.
I don't know, Bob.
I've tried to avoid Asians with weapons ever since Well it's thanks to the work of brave men like you that America's enemies are working here for minimum wage.
Mom, would you please stop playing with his hair?
You don't know where it's been.
I think a good dinner time policy might be everybody feeds and grooms themselves.
Oh, oh.
And speaking of grooming, Pamela, I noticed that your skirt was torn all the way up to your thigh.
No, I actually bought it this way.
See, most skirts are only slit up to the knee, but I think people want to see more than that.
Hear, hear.
Here comes the waiter.
I'm glad you're all here to help me celebrate this very special time with this very special lady.
Oh, Bob, it means a lot to me that you realize how special I am.
I do.
That's why I want to ask you to move in with me.
- Oh, my god.
- What?
Gosh, Bob, that's really sweet, and I'd really love to, but I'm seeing someone else.
Sorry.
But you'll still come visit, right?
what are you doing?
I'm not touching you.
Stop it !
But I'm not touching you.
Well, stop not touching me.
Okay.
wa it better when I wasn't touching you?
Yeah.
They look happy.
Why don't we have a game?
Would you stop asking me "why don't we have stuff" ?
"why don't we have a song"?
"Why don't we have a movie"?
We're men.
I thought we were sensitive men.
We're not.
One of us is.
Shut up!
And it's not you.
Well, Mitch, I'll tell you what.
It's been really fun having you over, but it's almost sundown and, uh, we celebrate the sabbath, so unless you have your..
your, uh your little beanie, then I guess we're gonna have to say adios or shalom, as we say.
You guys are jewish?
!
I'm jewish!
Oh, wow, you are gorgeous.
Are you kidding me?
No, no, no, no, I'm the pretty one.
Me.
You're the hottest redhead since batgirl.
And you're not just gorgeous.
I mean, you radiate intelligence deep thought, a real sense of self.
Eric, I like your new friend.
She's gotta be with you, huh?
Oh, I can't say I haven't tried, my little friend, but she's with Eric for now.
Really?
Well, what's wrong with her?
Is she, like, an alcoholic or a drug addict?
Yeah.
Yeah, she's addicted.
She needs a daily dose of this guy.
I just think it's pretty suspicious that after we left the japanese restaurant our japanese carbroke down.
Hey, buddy.
Whoa, Eric, you didn't tell me you had an older sister.
Oh, please, if you're gonna go with fake charm, let's keep it in the realm of reality, okay?
Oh, you shut your porky mouth.
I have the skin of a 25-year-old who smokes.
You know, Mr. Forman, I learned a little about cars from my uncle who used to fix tanks in Vietnam.
Now that's hero's work fixing machines that kill people you don't agree with.
My only regret is that I haven't had a chance to fight for my country.
Really?
Eric's only regret is that he doesn't live in space.
That's not my only regret.
It's just one of them.
Excellent fruity bebbles.
You know, at the police academy they'll only give me corn flakes, 'cause they say the sugar gets me too hopped upto carry a weapon.
I guess what they weren't counting on was me taking my weapon home for the weekend.
poor dad.
He's so upset.
This morning during "the price is right" he didn't even yodel along during "cliff hanger".
Donna, we wanted them apart and now they are.
Look, some things just don't belong together, like my mom and your dad or Michael and a gun.
No, seriously, how could they give me a gun?
You don't even sound like you feel bad.
Donna, this whole thing is your dad's fault.
Oh, come on, donna.
Who asked the woman to move in with him after knowing her for such a short time?
I'll tell you who The same guy who let you move in here after your parents took off and you had no place else to go my dad.
I mean, you know your mom is wrong and that she hurt my dad who's never been anything but nice to you.
How can you defend her?
I picked the pretty one.
Hey, dad.
How you doin'?
How do you think I'm doing?
Pam ripped out my heart and stomped on it in shoes I paid for.
Well, do you want to go down to the pet store and look at puppies?
You could sing "how much is that doggie in the window"?
And I'll do the "Arf!
Arf"!
part.
Nah, I'm gonna watch "Love Boat".
I think the big guy in the shorts is finally gonna nail the girl with the clipboard.
Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah!
I'm sorry.
That's the sugar.
Okay, Kelso, truth or dare?
Uh truth.
have you ever snuck into my bathroom while I was showering?
I mean, dare.
You have snuck in there.
I was there, and I saw you.
I mean, dare.
Okay, Steven, truth or dare?
The truth will be whether or not you love me, and the dare will be telling me that you love me.
Okay.
pass.
Okay, Mitch, truth or dare?
Um, I pick dare, Mitch.
Okay, Mitch, I dare you to kiss Donna.
Mitch.
Naughty Mitch.
Mitch, you goofball, that's not how it works.
You have to be like, "I dare you to kiss me".
Okay.
What the hell?
!
He did it!
Look at him go.
He's like a hummingbird.
I can't believe Mitch would do that.
He just flew at you like one of the little monkeys from "The Wizard of Oz".
I was scared.
Much like you are when you watch "The Wizard of Oz".
Okay, look, I don't want Mitch hanging out here anymore.
He was just fooling around.
He didn't mean anything by it.
It's like Fez.
He's all over me all the time, but it doesn't mean he's after me.
Oh.
Yes, it does.
From now on, I'll try to be clearer.
Oh, mom, there you are.
How could you do that to Bob?
Now, honey, Bob'll be fine.
No, he won't.
Mom, bob is a wonderful guy with a huge heart who only worries about what he could do for other people.
And, yeah, okay, maybe he has an afro.
But sometimes goodness and afros go together.
But, Jackie, the other guy that I'm seeing is a Lincoln dealer.
Oh, my god, mom, really?
!
Wow, we could be driving matching pink..
no, no.
Mom, no.
No.
Okay, look, I know..
I know that Bob might not be the the smoothest or the classiest guy you've ever dated, but I've learned that doesn't mean he's a bad person.
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have sent you to public school.
Mom, if you keep thinking this way, you'll always be running from one place to another looking for something better instead of just being happy with what you have.
You know what?
I guess you have a lot of thinking to do.
You're right.
More tequila, Hirohito.
I said thinking.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hyde?
Well, I guess it's time for me and It was a dark time for the Force.
After the Formanian wars, young Luke Skywalker had to face his most formidable enemy yet..
Darth Vader with a rare and deadlier green lightsaber.
what?
No.
Mitch!
Mitch, these omelets are amazing.
Well, you know, an omelet's only as beautiful as the person who eats it.
So, I'd have to say that this omelet has the prettiest red hair I've ever seen.
Thief!
He's a thief!
You stole my Vader action figure.
Oh, you too ?
I thought Eric was the only one weird enough to play with a doll.
Action figure.
You know, it's bad enough you stole a kiss from my girlfriend, but this..
this has gone too far.
Oh, so my honor is less important than a doll?
Action figure!
Now give it back!
Hold on just a second.
Now, Mitch, did you or did you not put onions in my omelet?
'Cause I asked for 'em, but I didn't see you put 'em in there.
Eric, I didn't take your action figure.
- Dolls !
- Action Figure !
I wouldn't do that, especially not to a friend.
What?
We're not friends, man.
We never were.
I only invited you over here 'cause I felt bad for you, but I don't like you.
And guess what.
Neither does anyone else.
Fine.
I won't bother you guys anymore.
Somebody needs to flip that in about three minutes!
Well, that was brutal.
I feel bad for the little guy.
I just wanna put him up on my shoulders and buy him a balloon.
Eric, how could you?
Mitch had a lot of good qualities, like, for example, he worshiped me.
I mean, at one point, I thought he was gonna light a fire and dance around me.
Yeah, well, you know what?
I was right, okay?
He's a thief.
Eric, were you playing in the bathtub with your little doll?
Action figure!
Oh, no.
In the tub, Forman?
It is getting really hard to be your friend.
Okay, I'd like to thank everyone for coming back here with me.
True, it is the place of my greatest humiliation.
But the fish is good, the sake's strong, and these Japanese people are funny to watch.
That's the spirit, dad..
the slightly offensive spirit.
Well, you know, I think you're lucky to be rid of Pam with her halter tops and her tight skirts.
You know, I've never even seen a panty line on her.
You know what that means.
Plus, you're too nice for my mom anyway.
You know, someday you're gonna make a slightly less attractive woman very happy.
Hello, Bob.
No, it's not a beautiful dream, it's really me.
I've been doing some thinking, Bob, and I realized that my priorities are a little mixed up.
I told her that!
That was me!
I saved the day!
It doesn't matter how it happened.
The important thing is she's back in our lives.
Anyway, Bob, I realize that you're the man for me.
I'm sorry, Pam.
It's too late.
I'm completely over you..
o-v-e-r, over.
And I want to move in with you.
Here's your key.
Dad?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
She makes me happy, kitten.
Ugh, fine.
But I don't want to see, like, any of her pantie slaying around the house.
Oh, don't worry.
You won'T.
Hey, Mitch.
Look, I wanted to apologize.
I thought you stole my Vader, but it turns out I left it in the b..
Hyde stole it.
Yeah, I guess I was out of line, too.
I shouldn't have jumped on your girlfriend in front of you.
It's just, you have such a great life.
And if I never see you or your friends ever again, I'm always gonna treasure that time that I spent with Donna.
Okay, well then I'll just say good-bye.
so lonely.
Hey, Mitch, uh you know, if you ever want to hang out, you know, you're always you know.
Great.
Thanks.
Oh, are we gonna do this now?
Yeah, buddy, let's do it!
Okay.
Right.
Hey, so do you think I might have a shot with Donna?
Mitch, she's my fiancée.
So that's a maybe!
Oh, Pamela, hi.
I just, um, came here to get my scarf.
Oh, phew, here it is.
You lost our scarf I must to make you nervous.
We take a drink ?
Oh, oh, well, it's a little early, but..
oh, it's probably Two saigon slammers, hold the fruit.
First round's on me.
That's okay.
I have a tab.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
You know, before we decided not to have sex..
you decided.
I'm ready.
Right.
I decided.
Movies were just a dark place to fool around before we went home and did it, but now we can really watch the movie.
Isn't that great?
It's fabulous.
I mean, there's nothing I hate more than the feeling that I'm about to have sex.
Hi.
Hi!
Hey!
Hi!
Okay.
Isn't that the girl who sells slurpees?
Why is she saying "hi" to you?
I don't know.
It's weird.
I've never talked to her before.
I mean, maybe one time I said, "you're out of spoon straws," but that's it.
great.
Now I have to sit through "Kramer vs.
Kramer" again with no shot at nookie.
First time we saw it, I said, "you know, dads can be good parents, too," and Donna's shirt just floated off.
what is wrong with me?
A boy's gonna lose his mother, and all I can think about is fooling around.
I am such a dirty girl.
I should be spanked.
Ooh, stop it!
Screw it.
Sneak attack is my only hope.
I'm gonna go with the yawn and grab.
Watch out for my hand, pretty mama, 'cause I'm not really tired.
Oh, god.
It's the yawn and grab.
How do I stop it?
Oops!
Oh, sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's okay.
Great.
Now my lap's covered in hot buttered popcorn.
That's the most action I've gotten in weeks.
Oh, thanks for helping move Pam into my house, Kitty.
You know what they say lady number three's a charm.
You have been so warm and friendly.
You simply must teach me how to be like that.
Pam, I'd just like to say on behalf of Fez and myself, that it is a privilege and a turn-on to carry your underthings.
And you don't have to pay me.
I took a few souvenirs.
Well, enjoy.
Oh, Red, I'd help you with the boxes, but I don't want to tire myself out.
I'm gonna be up all night welcoming Pam to the house.
Okay, see you later.
Have fun.
Close your shades.
What do we do with these boxes?
Let's just stick 'em in there.
Hi, boys.
That 70's Show - Saison 6 - Episode 20 "Squeezebox" Mitch, what are you doing here?
Oh, I made a peach cobbler for Donna, and I forgot to leave it when I was in here last night.
You weren't in here last night.
Well, not as far as you know.
Okay, look, Mitch, I know you're in love with her, but it's not gonna work out.
You're as big as you're gonna get.
And trust me, okay?
Donna's still growing.
Jackie, we need to talk.
Eric and I came really close to doing it, and I am so jacked-up on hormones, I feel like I could jump the first guy I see.
Then look my way, pretty lady.
Okay, Mitch, you know I love having you around 'cause you say really nice things about me.
Like how the sun pales in radiance to the beauty of your smile?
- Yeah, like that.
- Yeah.
But I have to talk to Jackie, and it's girl stuff.
Oh, you're so strong.
You make me feel like Jessica Lange in "King Kong".
Hey, Red.
Hi, boys.
I could kill you without making a sound.
You know, I'm worried we don't have enough chicken for dinner tonight.
Do these breasts look big enough?
I'm not comfortable with that question.
- What?
- What?
What?
what are you laughing at?
Just life.
It's a hoot.
Well, I don't know what's in that orange juice, but I'm gonna pour myself a glass.
- Red, what I want to know is, what did Pam mean?
- Not here Toyota.
This is the only place that's safe.
Look, if I was a single man, what we saw today would be, like, a reward for a life time of disappointments.
But I'm not.
So it's just another disappointment.
For you, maybe.
I saw 'em.
I don't care who knows it.
You better care, 'cause if Kitty finds out, I'm taking you down with me.
And when I take people down, they stay down.
Just ask North Korea.
But I have so many questions.
I mean, I've been flashed before.
But it was always followed with either, "get out"!
Or "there's a 2-drink minimum," but, "hi, boys"?
It has me reeling.
Oh, maybe she was coming on to us.
She wasn't coming onto us.
She was coming onto me.
She heard about my war record.
I'm a hero.
You know why Darth Vader went to the dark side?
He was dating a redhead who wouldn't put out.
So you are like Darth Vader in the sense that you're not getting any.
But you are not like Darth Vader in the sense that you are weak and strike fin no one.
Well, this is certainly one way to spend an afternoon.
I never really got into making models.
Guess I was too busy having sex.
Hey, I don't have sex, and I still don't build models.
I don't have a single model or a single girl.
My life is an empty hole.
Hey, nice job.
You put the force field generators on backwards.
One photon torpedo, and you're space toast.
Okay, Eric, that's it.
I think we should have sex.
- Yes!
- No!
Okay, I'm going crazy not being with you.
You may not be a strong man, but you read my body like braille.
Burn!
Wait.
W-what's "braille"?
you two were awfully quiet at dinner tonight.
Is there anything I should know about?
- No.
- No.
- I'll get it.
- Me too.
Hi, boys.
oh, Kitty, every time I come to this house I'm amazed by how much you've done with so little.
Here.
We brought Kahlúa.
Well, aren't you just an angel sent from after-dinner drink heaven?
She wanted to get you cookies, but I know how much you like the sauce.
- Red - Toyota!
Did you see that look she just gave us?
Was that, "please don't tell anyone you saw my boobs"?
Or, "please come over and see my boobs again"?
Do you have to keep saying that word?
Let's just call them "them".
This is the last time we ever talk about it.
From here on out, it never happened.
- But, Red-- - Steven, I have been to war.
I have seen a lot of things in my life.
And there only three things that I was gonna keep secret until the day I die.
This is number four.
And five.
Okay, the tractor beam is operational.
Don't get too close.
You really gonna shine your love light on that?
Well, he's a different person between the sheets.
What can I say?
Hey, guys.
Hey, listen, tomorrow I have this police test on interrogation techniques.
I was wondering if I could practice on somebody.
Jackie, how about you?
Oh, well, no.
This is your first time.
You're gonna need somebody much more spineless than me.
Try Eric.
Yeah, that's good thinking.
All right, Mr. Forman, if that is indeed your real name what did you do on the day of yesterday?
You'll never get it out of me, copper.
I'm no rat!
Kelso, what the hell?
!
Oh, just relax, Eric.
I'm just doing good cop/bad cop.
That was the bad cop, but he's gone now.
See, now good cop is here to take care of you.
Hey, how you doin', buddy?
It's a real shame about what happened to your model.
Why don't you tell me what you did yesterday?
I came home from the restaurant and spent six hours building that model!
Uh, excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but what about your encounter at the store with the girl who sells slurpees?
What?
Yeah, you remember.
She asked why you never call her anymore.
You were like ooh.
Wait.
Is that the girl from the movies?
Donna, I'm asking the questions here.
Was that the girl from the movies?
What happened to, "I barely know her"?
What happened to, "I barely know her"?
Why were you calling her, Eric?
- Why were you calling her, Eric?
- Kelso, will you shut up?
!
Oh, yeah, it's getting hot in here, isn't it?
!
Look, Donna maybe I kinda know her.
Maybe we kinda went out a couple times when you were dating Kelso's brother Wait.
You got other girls besides Donna to go out with you?
What is this obsession with the underdog?
So the other day at the movies you lied to me?
Donna, I am the senior officer here.
So the other day at the movies you lied to me.
No, I you know, I mean, it was the movies, you know?
It's all make-believe.
Okay, you know what?
Don't bother coming over tonight.
My sexual tension has been replaced with another familiar emotion-- anger at your scrawny ass!
- No!
- Yes!
Well, good job, Michael.
You solved one crime and prevented an even bigger one Donna having sex with Eric.
You have the right to remain burn!
I'm just glad I could help the truth be told.
Yeah, at least someone's being honest around here.
Mitch, what the hell?
What.
I thought you came off looking great.
Oh, wait.
That was me.
everyone, I want to thank you for making me so welcome.
I feel like the only guest at an inexpensive backwoods hotel.
Steven, you're so tense.
Of course he's tense,mom.
You're the one who taught me that if your man's not tense when you walking to the room, that means you're doing something wrong.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm tense because of you, 'cause you're..
too pretty.
Oh, Red, I was gonna get you a thank you gift for helping with the move, but then I figured, nah.
So thanks.
Don't mention it, Bob.
Don't mention anything about that day ever again.
Why?
It was a pretty good day.
Nothing got broken.
Nobody got hurt.
You two even got to see Pam topless.
Yeah, first time I saw 'em, I was speechless, too.
Alright.
I admit that we saw Pam's them.
But it's not like we planned it.
Although our timing couldn't have been better.
Oh, I think you mean "worse," Steven.
No, I'm pretty sure I meant "better".
Red, how could you?
Kitty, we just opened the door, and there she was what was I supposed to do, rip the eyes out of my head?
Don't feel bad, you guys.
This isn't the first time my body has caused a fight.
One time I caused a riot on a topless beach in Venezuela.
Imagine what you saw, only all tanned and oiled.
Oh.
She told me to.
Well hate to let the cat out of the bag and then leave, but looks like that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Enjoy your fight I can't believe you saw my mother topless and didn't tell me about it right away.
What, so every time I see another woman's breasts I'm supposed to tell you?
Now I know.
I am so mad.
I can't even stand to look at you.
And yet you do.
Because your eyes work.
You see my problem?
All right.
All right.
We're going.
I can't believe Eric lied to me about that girl.
I mean, we're getting married.
I should know everything about him.
If I have to know that he wore a bathing suit in the tub until he was 12 yeah, tell everybody.
I should know who he dated.
That's right.
Just get it off your chest, Donna.
all the rage and the anger and the clothing.
Hey, Hey, Hey there's only room for one creepy pervert in this group, and that's me.
Around here, i'm the one who drools over all the ladies.
Well, I don't drool over all the ladies, just Donna.
A specialist, ha?
Ok we'll try it your way.
Oh my god.
You don't think Eric and that girl..
Made sweet emotional love?
Yes, I do.
Bought many a slurpee from her.
And from what I can tell, she'll do it with anyone Did she do it with you?
No, she has way too much self-respect for that.
I am gonna march right in that room and tell my mother there are consequences on her topless actions.
And that she needs to start wearing pantyhose.
This isn't Las Vegas.
Oopsy Doosy So then she goes, "Hi, Boys" I mean, that has to be a "come on", right?
saw this dirty movie once where the plumbers knock on the door and the lady answers, and says "hi, boys" after that, it was all asses and elbows.
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Hyde.
There's a lot of guys that Pam would choose before you and Red All right, it goes "me" then Bob Fez, then you Red, then me again Then Donna, then Eric.
Okay, Eric, there's something I need to know.
Did you or did you not do it with the slurpee slut?
What?
He answered a question with a question.
That means he's guilty.
Now let's ditch him and carry me out of here.
Donna, I did not sleep with her.
Well, you lied to met about her before, so why should I believe you now?
You don't believe me?
Fine.
Let me show you what I was doing while you were with Casey.
You're gonna hide in your bedroom and cry?
Or you gonna try to write a song again?
Hey guys, what rimes with "pain"?
I loved that song Everyday is like rain when you're in pain.
Ok, Donna This is is a box full of model that I made while you were with Casey Kelso.
Look at this : Tie Fighters, assault vehicules and troop transports all with minor defects in workmanship.
Ye he made these, all right.
So this is what you did when we were apart?
Oh my horny nerd boy Donna, there's a reason I didn't tell you about her.
She wasn't important.
The whole time we broke up..
you know you know I never stopped loving you.
Eric.
Hyde, I never stopped loving you, either.
Don't.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
You guys better be kidding, or I'm gonna be super pissed.
So can I suggest that we honor the age-old tradition of making up after a fight, not just spiritually, but physically?
How about a brand-spanking-new tradition where I buy you a milkshake and a "playboy"?
Donna, whoa.
I'm insulted.
I do not need a milkshake.
Let's go.
So they're back together and everything's fine?
That sucks.
See what happens when you specialize?
I can go and make any number of ladies uncomfortable.
What can you do?
what do you think he meant by, "whoopsy doozy"?
Not here.
Toyota!
Oh, I'm so freaked out, Mrs. Forman.
I'm gonna have to sleep with the light on.
What are you two doing out here?
We--we were just uh-oh!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Hey, guys.
- Mitch!
I thought I heard a matchbox car pull up.
Yeah, I'm short, and you're shaped like a lollipop.
I'm not in the mood, Forman.
My brother Jack's wedding is tomorrow, and I don't have a date.
Oh, did you try Aly Richards?
She'll go anywhere there's cake.
That's how I got her into my car.
But then I ate the cake, and she left.
Oh, I'm in a real bind here.
I showed up at the engagement party alone.
My family made so much fun of me.
So I said to myself, 'cause, of course, I was alone, that I would bring someone sizzling hot with me to the wedding.
Hey, Donna, would you be my date?
Mitch, I don't know what to say.
Oh, let me help you out.
"NO"!
Donna, if you went with me, I might finally earn some respect from my family.
Let me say this for you one more time in Spanish.
NO!
I taught him that.
Eric, it seems harmless.
No, Donna, I'm sorry, but I forbid it.
Oh.
Mitch, I'd love to go.
- Donna, what the hell?
- No, I forbid you to ask me questions about this.
- But, Donna - Let me tell you one more time in Spanish oh, hey, Donna, thanks so much for doing this.
Sure, but, you know, just friends.
You don't get to touch any of this juicy stuff.
No, don't worry.
I'll even ask another couple to be, like, chaperones.
Hey, Jackie, do you and Hyde want to go?
Oh, I'm in.
But I can't ask Steven.
I'm still on probation for tricking him into a ballroom dancing class.
I'll go with you, Jackie, but I warn you don't drink too much.
I will take advantage.
That 70's show - Saison 6 - Episode 21 "5-15" Wow.
I can't believe you finally sprung for cable tv.
Wasn't it you who said, "I'd rather kiss Ho Chi Minh than pay for tv"?
Well, your mother and I are running out of things to talk about, so I thought the extra 20 channels might help fill in the gaps.
Cable guy left?
He forgot to hook up the basement.
No, he didn't so much forget as follow my "don't hook up the basement" instructions.
But, Red, for an extra 2 bucks a month, your wife and children could be enjoying full-frontal nudity.
But I don't want you to enjoy anything.
I want people your age out of my house.
Hey, I'm only here 'cause you had a heart attack.
I only had a heart attack because you're here.
I'm sorry, Michael, but I'm gonna have to search that bag.
Every time you leave my house with a backpack, I have to buy new hair spray.
I didn't take anything.
This is lunch.
I planned a whole romantic day for me and Brooke.
So where are you and Brooke headed?
Well, since she's having a baby, I thought I'd take her to a place that kids and girls like, so I figured I'd start the date off at an amusement park and we'd go on a ride on the "lightning whip".
I'm gonna take her horseback riding up to this overlook, and then we're gonna get cozy and drink a little Bingo-Bango.
Oh, sweetie, you're so wrong, it makes me want to cry a little.
Pregnant women can't go on roller coasters, and they definitely can't drink alcohol, or bad things can happen to the baby.
Case in point..
Eric.
Well, we didn't know any better back then.
I'm teaching a baby-care class at the hospital.
If you brought Brooke, I think she'd be very impressed.
All right.
Yeah, sign us up.
You know, there was a time that all I had to do to impress a girl was turn my eyelids inside out.
This baby's changing everything.
Oh.
Thanks again for doing this, Donna.
Grandpa saw me walk in with you, and he slipped me a 20.
Here, you should have this.
See, that kind of makes me a hooker.
Well, hello.
Looks like we're sharing a table here.
Here's your drink, here's your bread, and here's your new lover.
You wish.
I'm sitting next to a goddess.
I know.
Didn't my hair come out great tonight?
Not you, shorty.
Her.
I need your help.
Oh, this is so easy, Fez.
She's like me.
She's a country club girl, and we're bitches.
We only understand one thing..
money.
- How much should I give her?
- No.
Fez, act rich.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Eric.
Eric, what are you doing here?
I changed my work schedule so I could make sure that Mitch keeps his tiny little doll hands to himself.
Eric, Mitch is not a threat to you.
Okay, he's a perfectly harmless guy who happens to worship the ground I walk on.
You know, it's not his fault that I'm eye candy.
Well, relax.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Welcome to the holiday hotel ballroom.
I'll be your waiter this evening, but unlike a normal waiter, I despise and may try to destroy you.
Waiter, I'm rich.
And as a rich man, I have much more money than you.
Fez, I'm really not in the mood.
Sometimes I'm not in the mood to count all my money, but I do it anyway because I am a fat cat.
Yeah, well, your bow tie is starting to unclip, fat cat.
Unbelievable.
They come to this country.
We give them a job they're just so ungrateful.
I'm Christy.
And you are?
Ferrari.
Fez Ferrari.
hahaha..
oh, this charity car wash was a great idea, girls.
Let's take our shirts off!
Who changed my channel?
What the Steven!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Stealing my cable!
Red, before you blow your stack, why don't you take a look at that car wash girl?
She is so sudsy.
You drilled a hole in my floor.
My foot is about to drill a hole in your ass!
But, Red, the car wash girls have to make $500 or their super-freaky love nest is gonna be turned into a bookstore.
Look, there's only one clicker, and that's upstairs.
My cable, my channel.
stop spraying me, silly, or I'm gonna have to come over there and kiss you.
Tasha, you want a kiss, too?
Wow, Tasha, you have the biggest..
thunderstorms, which will result in a small-craft advisory on lake superior.
No, no!
Man, look at all these preggos.
God, that one's walking like a gigantic duck.
She's definitely in her third trimester.
The baby probably dropped.
Nah, I think it's still in there.
It means the baby's gotten itself into the birthing position.
Oh.
Man, you really know stuff.
Well, I've read every baby book in the library.
By the way, did you ever read that book I gave you by Dr. Spock?
No, I kind a lost interest when I realized it wasn't about "Star Trek".
Well, you signed us up for this class, and that was very thoughtful.
Well, that's me.
I'm Mr. Thoughtful.
Man, how many kids are you having?
Oh, hi, Michael.
Hope you're ready to talk boo-boos, burps and binkies.
Yeah, uh, Brooke, this is Mrs. Forman, the lady that told me I shouldn't take you horseback riding.
And, Mrs. Forman, this is Brooke, the hot librarian I impregnated.
Well, I am so happy you two are here.
And you should be happy, because you have me as your tour guide as you make the transition to parenthood.
Michael.
But that could have been anybody.
Everybody knows I rule.
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's get started.
Now, when you first bring your little bundles of joy home, they will spend almost Man, that's the life, huh?
Now who can tell me what they will do with the rest of their cute, little time?
- Ooh.
Yes, Brooke.
- They'll be eating.
Very good.
And what will they be eating?
Hey, when you're not looking, I'm gonna sneak the little guy some popcorn.
Michael, babies can't eat popcorn.
They don't even have teeth.
My grandma bessie doesn't have any teeth, and trust me, she ain't shy around a bucket of popcorn.
Well, Christy says money's great, but she wants to get to know the real me.
And, And, um, I really care about her.
So what's another fake, good quality I could pretend to have to trick her into the sack?
Okay, um, okay, well, she's wearing fur, which means she must love animals, which means she must like sensitive guys.
Sensitive, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you're good.
Hey, cutie.
Where you been?
Who the hell do you think you are, talking to me like that?
I'm sensitive.
I..
I guess it's a tradition for the best man to say a few words.
And all I really want to say is that my brother is not the only one fortunate enough to find himself in love's warm embrace.
So, everybody, I'd like to introduce you to Donna..
my new fiancée.
Or as I like to call her, my big, red love machine.
That's her.
Mitch, what the hell are you doing?
Ooh, look at that fireball go.
Feisty at the table, feisty in the bedroom.
No.
No.
She's feisty in my bedroom, people.
My bedroom.
Okay, he's just some lying, crazy lunatic.
He's crazy.
This guy's crazy.
And, uh, my congratulations to the happy couple.
This is the best wedding I have ever been to.
barometric pressure from a cold front out of Canada.
Look at all that hail in Buffalo.
How can you watch this?
It comforts me to know that there are people out there more miserable than me, like those people in Buffalo and you.
You have to sit here?
Why don't you go read a book?
Why don't you go read a book?
Because I have cable.
Very nice.
Baby says, "it's tight, but not too tight, and I wuv the way you powdered my wittle bottom".
I never thought I'd say this, but you gotta take it easy on the 'nads.
I know what I'm doing.
It's just, it sounded so much easier in the books.
Okay, there.
Ooh, let's have a look.
Uh-oh.
Baby says, "that's too loose.
Now I'm gonna wee-wee on daddy".
I just have to redo the safety pin.
God, why can't I do this?
Oh, no.
Baby says, "ouch, you poked me.
Now I'm gonna cry.
Wah!
Wah"!
That's it.
I give up.
"Oh, mommy, don't leave me.
I don't want to end up in state-run foster care.
Wah!
Wah"!
You know, you seem normal around your family, but out in the world, you're a little nuts.
So it turns out I was right about Mitch.
So let's see, that's you, wrong.
Me, right.
All right, you don't have to rub it in.
Uh, I think I do, Donna So rub-a-dub-dub, I'm right.
I am humiliated!
The only way I'm gonna get my pride back is to kick your ass!
So I'm challenging you to a fight.
That is, unless you're too chicken.
What is this, third grade?
Okay, here's what I just heard.
ba-gawk, ooh, third grade, ooh.
Okay, you can stop doing that.
- Bawk, I can stop doing that, bawk.
- Okay, fine.
You know what?
I'll fight you.
Fine.
Good.
Tomorrow!
5:15, the playground.
You be there!
Um, why not just do it at 5?
I have swimming lessons!
thank you so much for helping me with Christy.
She was telling me what she did last summer at camp, and I think she might be a whore.
- So if there's anything I can do for you..
- Actually, Fez, there is.
When the bride tosses the bouquet, I really want to catch it.
It's such a sweet and magical moment, so I need you to knock some of those fat sluts out of my way.
I will make those weebles wobble.
And they will fall down.
Fez Ferrari, you're so rich and sensitive, I think I might go all the way with you.
But only if you get everyone out of my way so I can catch the bouquet.
How many bouquets do they throw?
One.
Aye.
Let's see, who do I help?
Old friend, new whore?
Old friend, new whore?
Oh, what am I saying?
Do the right thing, Fez.
Okay, I don't know who gave you a tattoo, but that is not good parenting.
Look, Michael, I don't want to talk about it.
I thought I was ready, but today I found out I don't know how to use a diaper.
We are gonna be covered in poo.
Look, I think you're underestimating us, all right?
Especially me.
These beautiful hands aren't just made for foreplay.
Check it out.
I remember the first time I baby sat for my little brother and he power-dooked all over himself, right?
So I got my mom's salad tongs and pulled off his pants, and then I grabbed him by the ankles and took him outside and hosed him off.
And voilà.
Oh, Michael, it's so perfect.
See, you got the brains and the maternal instincts, and I know how to wrap ass.
We're gonna do this together, and we're gonna be fine.
"Ooh, daddy ,that's just how I like it".
You're really starting to creep me out.
winds variable out of the northeast, oh, weather kicks ass.
Forman, I'm your bud, so I'm rooting for you in this fight.
But business is business, so I got 50 bucks on the little guy.
Well, I see the chicken showed up for his beating.
How can I be a chicken if I showed up for the fight?
You know, it's funny, 'cause what I just heard was chicken bawk!
Fight bawk!
Eric, as someone that has been punched a lot, I have some advice.
Do not move to a new country and try to fit in at high school.
Hey, Forman, come back here so we can go over the rules.
Okay, Eric, one last thing.
You know when we're play-fighting and you grab my wrist and I go, "ow!
Ow!
Ow"!
?
That doesn't really hurt.
Okay?
So..
.
don't do that.
What?
The Forman death grip?
Man, I was really counting on that.
What are you doing here?
I don't want to fight you.
I was just trying to act tough so I can get my self-respect back.
By threatening me?
It's okay.
It's okay.
I've got a way out of this that'll make us both look good.
We'll tell everyone that we worked it out like gentlemen, and now we're the best of friends.
Well, no.
Mitch, look, Donna was really nice to you, and you humiliated her.
I can't let you treat people like that.
Today I'm I'm standing up for all humanity.
Would you do it for a 1968 G.I. Joe desert rat edition with the original mess kit?
Please.
I have three of those.
- The French version?
- G.I. Jacques.
It does exist.
We got a deal?
Well, I'm afraid there's not gonna be a fight here.
Uh, guys, we worked out our differences, and basically, he's a really great guy.
- He's doing the chicken thing behind me.
- Yeah.
He's really good at it.
That's not the only thing I'm good at, cherry pie.
All right, that's it.
You're dead.
Ooh!
ooh!
ohh!
Start the car, Mom!
Start the car!
temperatures in the..
ooh, Mr. Handyman.
I'm so glad you're here.
There's so many things I need you to nail.
lucky for you I have a big hammer.
Red, you dirty man.
Mrs. Forman.
What are you watching?
Weather.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, Donna, now that we have our wedding rings and you can't back out, I have something that I want to confess.
I want to do the bunny hop at our wedding.
I'm good at it, and I don't get to show it off that often.
Okay, but I want to walk into the reception under an archway of cupcakes.
Ooh, deal.
Don't look!
Turn away!
Whoa.
What?
What?
Oh.
Did you get me a present?
Is it bongo drums?
No.
I don't want you to see my wedding dress.
It's bad luck.
Isn't having sex before the wedding the bad luck thing?
Well, that too.
Eric, getting married is like one big minefield.
One false step, and limbs just flying everywhere.
Well, don't worry.
I didn't see your wedding dress, so so I think we just saved ourselves some bad luck.
Now let's take that credit that we've earned and use it to have sex.
Come on.
We can't lose.
It's gonna be like playing with the house's money.
Eric, if we broke our celibacy vow now, what would it say about us?
It would say, "yay!
We had sex"!
All right, fine.
Can we look at our ring inscriptions, or is that bad luck, too?
Well, no, that I have to look at so I can return it in case you wrote something stupid.
"To Eric, love Donna".
Well, it's not stupid.
It's short.
It's terse.
Quite possibly even a little rude.
"All my friends know the low rider".
Um, I don't get it.
Am I the low rider?
Wait.
What do you mean all your friends know me?
Are you saying I'm a whore?
No, no, Donna.
"Low rider" is the song that was playing in the car at the end of our first date.
Remember, you wore that red dress, and at the end of the night, I kissed you, and I remember thinking I justyou know, I just can't believe she's with me.
Eric, that is the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
Take your pants off.
That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
That 70's Show - Saison 6 Episode 22 "Sparks" Fellas, I convinced Donna to break her celibacy vow, which in laymen's terms means I'm a layman.
Damn, Forman, got your girlfriend to have sex with you?
What is your secret?
Okay, you guys, it's a big deal.
Have either of you ever slept with my girlfriend?
No, but I've done it with Hyde's girlfriend.
And I was good.
Well, just what the heck is this?
What a great auction!
Red had a few beers and bought a canoe.
I bought a canoe!
Who would've thought me and Red go out and he's the one to buy something stupid?
I don't know where I'm gonna put this.
Red, why would you buy a canoe?
I think the question is why haven't I before?
But we can't afford this.
Sure we can.
I used the money that you gave me yesterday.
That was for Eric's wedding present.
Congratulations, Eric.
I knew you always wanted a canoe.
Fine, Red.
Since you blew the money, I expect you to come up with a nice sentimental gift for Eric that doesn't cost anything.
Well, that's what you get for going out and drinking.
Maybe one day you'll learn to stay at home and drink, like me.
Hey, boys.
I bought a canoe.
Oh, hey, Jackie.
I just left my coat here after Donna and I well, I'm sure she already filled you in on all the juicy details.
Yeah, heard all about your little leg cramp.
Hey, I can turn a leg cramp into magic!
Ehh she just doesn't get me.
Oh, no, Donna's wedding dress.
Oh, no.
Donna's wedding dress.
Bad luck.
Bad voodoo.
Please.
Give me a break.
A well, boys, thanks to our time here in the circle, I've come up with a perfectly rational way to keep Donna from finding out that I tore her dress.
I'm gonna destroy the earth.
Okay, well, first you gotta go to another planet and then you gotta build a giant a death ray and aim it at the earth.
That's pretty complicated.
I can lend you my sketches if you want.
That's a great plan.
It's like so many of our ideas sound good in the circle, but later on they just sound stupid.
But a death ray it's awesome.
Fez, stop smelling the dress.
Hey, either I do this now, or I do it at the reception.
It's your choice.
So Mrs. Forman told me to get this thing out of her sight.
Now that could mean put it in the garage, leave it out for the garbageman.
I like to think it meant, "hey, have a free canoe".
And the three of us with a canoe, we'll be unstoppable.
What should we do with it?
Let's see.
What could we do with a canoe that would make people say, "oh, no, what's wrong with them"?
Oh!
Oh!
I know what we could do today that's gonna be really fun.
Kelso, the last time you said that, we had to get your stomach pumped.
I'm in.
Hey, so, uh, how do you plan on steering this thing on land?
Duh.
Kelso, I think you should wear a helmet just in case anything goes wrong.
Fez, I'm riding an open canoe down a rocky mountainside.
What could possibly go wrong?
I think I'm with Fez on this helmet thing.
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one.
Falling for what?
The old helmet gag.
Kelso, I just want you to protect your head from being crushed like a berry.
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now let go of the ropes and watch me fly!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, man.
Stupid thing.
Oh, man, that..
that could've been me!
I don't get it.
Who's "the low rider"?
That's me.
Then I think he's calling you a whore.
Oh, my god!
My dress!
Yeah, doesn't look so good in daylight, does it?
No, it's gone.
Did you move it?
I didn't touch it.
Oh, Eric was here earlier.
Maybe he did something with it.
Why are you always blaming Eric for everything?
Oh, well, somebody has to, or he'll just go through life thinking there's nothing wrong I know what I could give Eric that's sentimental..
my old baseball glove.
Red, anything related to sports will only remind Eric of the things he doesn't do well.
Oh, fine.
I'll just go down to the space toy and smart mouth store.
psst!
Mom.
Mom, is Donna here?
No.
Why are we whispering?
You tore her dress?
Yeah, see, that would have been a really good thing to whisper!
All right, well, it doesn't look too bad.
I think I can fix it.
Put it down.
I'll get my sewing box.
Mom, thank you.
Not on the shoe polish!
What have you done, you bony bastards?
!
Okay, okay.
I think I can clean it, but we have to act fast.
- Okay, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go Please tell me that sound was a rip in the space-time continuum.
Okay, I'm gonna need some club soda, a little lemon juice and some vodka.
To get the stain out?
No, to think straight.
Eric!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Donna's coming.
Have you seen my wedding dress?
Whoa.
You lost the wedding dress?
What happens when we have a kid?
You gonna lose that, too?
Oh, my god.
I'll find it.
Don't worry.
I'll find it.
Okay.
What is the matter with you?
You just made her feel terrible.
I was nervous.
You know I don't know when to shut up.
What the hell is that?
You know, there is gonna be a time when you look back on this, and you're gonna think it's funny.
You're gonna be single 'cause Donna will never marry you, but you're gonna think it's funny.
We'll get a running start.
And then I'll jump in and zoom down the hill like the bobsledders do.
And then because this is a canoe on dirt and gravel instead of a bobsled on ice, bad things are gonna happen to you.
This is why I'm a legend Fez.
All right, Kelso, this time you're wearing a helmet.
Thanks, Hyde, but I think I'm not gonna put on a helmet with a bunch of worms and stuff crammed inside.
It's not a prank.
Well, now it's not 'cause I didn't fall for it.
It finally happened.
I've become the boy who cried helmet.
Okay, on three.
Go!
Whoo-hoo!
holy crap!
Did you see me bounce off of that tree?
Honey, what is taking so long?
I told you to put the dress in the wash for 20 minutes.
Yeah, and now it's in the dryer.
Oh, no, please tell me you just put it in.
Okay, okay.
Let's look on the bright side.
Maybe gray is a more honest color for Donna.
Hi.
Um, Fez, I know how you how do I say this?
Um..
I know you sometimes like to hang out in my closet.
Yes, and do you know what happened to my wedding dress?
Uh I have to go to the bathroom.
Eric, Donna wants to know what happened to her dress.
Oh, tell her you took it.
She'll kill me.
She'll kill me more.
Fine, fine.
But at your wedding, I want my own dance solo.
Yeah, Absolutely.
Anything you want.
With my own spotlight.
Fine.
- And a mention in the program.
- Fine!
Look, but if you don't get upstairs, there will be no wedding, which means there will be no dance solo.
Oh, there will be a dance solo.
I took it.
Why?
Uh, I forgot to go to the bathroom.
She wants to know why.
Because you're a pervert.
Hey!
No wait.
That's true.
I don't even have to lie.
Because I'm a pervert.
Fez, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Eric!
Oh, my god.
What happened to my dress?
Donna, I can explain.
I destroyed it.
You think maybe we're getting too old for this kind of thing?
No, you can't control the timing of when a canoe is gonna come into your life.
This is a horrible stunt.
You're gonna get hurt.
No, no, I'm driving the car.
Kelso will be in the canoe.
Oh, okay, have fun.
All right, Kelso, listen.
You gotta wear the helmet, all right?
Yeah, protect that face.
That's your money.
No, I don't want to.
Kelso, you're not pulling out of this driveway until you put on a helmet.
Fine.
Everyone's against me.
Let the sparks fly!
Whoo!
Look at that crazy bastard.
He may not be smart, but he has more fun than all of us combined.
Look, we had a guy like him in the national guard.
Yeah, what happened to him?
Invented the wiffle ball.
yeaaaah!
Donna, what happened?
It's ruined.
My dress is ruined.
What am I gonna do?
It's okay, honey.
I'll find you a new dress a better dress.
This is my greatest achievement ever!
Dad, I love this dress.
Some random thing off the rack just won't be the same.
The rope broke!
Runaway canoe!
Yes!
Oh, no, Donna, I think I ripped your dress.
Kitty, I think I've got it this time.
For my wedding present for Eric, one of my medals from the war.
No.
- How about my uniform from the war?
- No.
- My gun from the war?
- No.
- My boots from the war?
- No.
- My canteen from the war?
- No.
It can't be anything you had on or near you when you killed somebody.
How about the ring my dad wore?
Oh, that's nice.
When he killed people in World War I. Well, now you're just trying to make me mad.
Yeah, I am.
Look, Donna, I'm so sorry about what happened.
Well, what I don't get is after the second rip and the first stain, why you didn't just put the dress away.
Hmm.
Well, at that point, it had become personal.
It was me against the dress, and, well, I was damned if I was gonna let the dress win.
You know, I knew we shouldn't have broken our no-sex rule.
We completely cursed ourselves.
Okay, enough of this voodoo nonsense.
Bad things happen because I am stupid.
You're marrying a stupid guy, Donna.
Good luck with me.
Here, sweetie.
For you.
What's this?
Mom's wedding dress?
Yeah.
Swallowed a little pride and called to ask her if it would be okay.
Yeah, but you guys haven't talked in, like, a year.
It was a little awkward, especially when I said, "it's Bob".
And she said, "Bob who"?
I love it.
Hey, looks like we kinda saved the day.
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.
Thanks, daddy.
Hey, anything for you, pumpkin.
Plus, I need the room in the attic for my stuffed bobcat.
What was I thinking?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Forman, your bachelor party's tonight.
We're going to a strip club, so don't forget your inhaler.
Come on, Hyde.
I don't need a silly bachelor party.
Oh, come on, man.
Be one last night of the finest debauchery that point place has to offer.
Hyde, all I need is my sweetie here for the rest of my life.
- It's all right, Eric.
You can go.
- All right!
I'm gonna see nudies!
Oh, Eric, you're not going to one of those hoochie mama shows, are you?
Don't worry, Mrs. Forman.
I'll return your son in the same slightly girly condition that he leaves in.
So, Donna, you and the gals getting together for a big shindig?
Well, Jackie might be planning..
No, wait.
She doesn't do things for other people.
Well, let me plan your bachelorette party.
Oh, we went absolutely bonkers at mine.
All my girlfriends came over for a sewing bee, and then my friend Gloria gave me my first sip of hard cider.
Boy, you girls are crazy.
Well, back then,we had some morals, not like you girls today.
loose, throwing it around town like the paperboy.
Donna, why am I blindfolded?
Because I have a big surprise for you.
Okay, you ready?
Isn't it awesome?
We're gonna spray-paint our names on a trailer?
All right!
No, I put a deposit on it so we can live here.
Eric, it's gonna be our very own.
Oh, how romantic.
I can just see Donna carrying you over that threshold.
So come on.
I know you always dreamed about having a home of your own.
Well, I guess I should have been more specific.
Um, no, no.
You know what?
This is nice.
It's nice.
Donna, this is great!
Steven, if you ever rent me a trailer, I will dump you in a second.
Good to know.
I need an exit strategy.
See, now if we all turn this way There.
See?
Room for everybody.
See?
Now this is the closeness I've been craving.
Whose hand is that?
- Mine.
- Mine.
- Mine.
Oh, man.
Look at this tiny shower.
Donna, I don't think there's room in there for you to soap your chest like we like.
Donna are you sure you want to live in point place?
I always thought you wanted to leave town.
Well, Eric, that's when I was single.
But now that we're getting married, I want to settle down and start our lives together.
Yeah, but I always thought - You smell pretty.
- Okay.
Look, can we do this in private?
Bathroom's free.
Um, actually, I was just, uh, heading there.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Let me just get the, uh, curtain.
Okay, I can't do this with all you listening.
Somebody's gonna have to sing.
- Fez, you sing.
- I can't do both at the same time.
Please hurry!
On the good ship lollipop it's a sweet trip to the candy shop where the bonbons play I had a large soda.
On the sunny beach of peppermint bay That 70's Show - Saison 6 - Episode 23 "My wife" So it's ours starting today.
I signed the lease for a year.
Donna, all you ever talked about was seeing the world, and And my dad's better now.
I mean, we can get out.
Well, I don't wanna get out.
I just want to focus on doing this marriage thing right, And I think that means curling up every night next to you on that dining room table that doubles as a bed.
Well, the good news is, if you guys do decide to travel, You can always drive your house to any number of vacation destinations.
Yeah, and if you ever want to rearrange your furniture, all you gotta do is slam on the brakes.
Hold everything.
I believe that is the ice cream man.
Oh, wait.
Look, he's turning around!
No!
No, Come back!
We're not from here!
We won't rob you!
Oh I mean, it's pretty here.
There's lots of open space.
I'm coming in, Tracy!
There better not be anyone in there with ya!
Hey, the neighbors seem really nice.
Just tell him you're naked 'cause..
I don't know.
That's why I'm climbing out the window.
Casey Kelso?
Hey!
Pinciotti.
Casey, I thought you left town after going out with Donna and then breaking up with her so she had to settle for Eric.
Yeah, well, I found my way back.
Hey, For-play.
- You been working out?
- Oh, um, - Well, yeah, a few days a week.
- Oh, man, I'm just kidding.
Well, it's not funny.
He's huge.
Things are great.
Eric and I are getting married.
I'm on the radio..
"Hot Donna".
You might've heard people talking, wishing they could date me, that kind of stuff.
Yeah, I mean, Donna hasn't thought about you at all, although Eric's mom still asks about you.
Then she kind of giggles and fans herself.
You!
You get back here!
Hey, little advice..
never answer the phone when you're with a married lady.
See, Forman?
Now at the bachelor party you can hold a beer even after you've lost the ability to hold a beer from drinking all the beer.
I like it.
Kind of makes me wonder why god didn't just make us this way from the start, you know?
Don't worry, man.
Evolution will take care of it.
Hey, Steven, I took out all the $1 bills from your wallet, so now you have nothing to tip the strippers with.
All I have left is this $20?
Jeez, I'll never be able to get change for this.
Sorry I'm late, guys.
I spent all afternoon in front of the mirror.
Then I realized it was time to get dressed.
Fez, you don't have to look nice, all right?
Strippers like everybody.
They're raised that way on special farms out west.
Okay, Eric, I talked to my boss down at the radio station, and I told him we were staying in town, and I said that if he wanted to keep me, he would have to put me on the air full-time, - And he went for it!
"Hot Donna" every day on WFDP.
Oh, Donna, that's amazing.
All you had to do is ask?
Oh, and I tied my shirt up in one of those sexy knots.
Yeah, Jackie does that.
We have never paid to get into Six Flags.
- Wait.
But, Donna, if you take this job, how are you gonna..
- Why are you waving a mug at me?
I'm sorry.
How are you gonna find time for college?
I don't know.
I'll just stop going.
Eric, I'm a DJ.
I already have the kind of job I was going to college to get.
Yeah, college sucks anyways.
It's all smart people, and none of them are as pretty as me.
Yeah, that's true.
Half the people in this room ought to be in magazines.
Only half, though, and the rest of you know who you are.
Eric, we both have jobs.
We have a great place to live.
- We're gonna have the perfect life in point place.
- Huh.
That's funny.
I've never heard the words "perfect life" and "Point Place" used in the same sentence oh, except when separated by the phrase "as soon as I get the hell out of".
All right.
We gentlemen have a place to be.
So unless you ladies are gonna finally take your clothes off to music Last chance?
No?
Okay.
Wow, Mrs. Forman, you can really whip up a party in no time.
And we have activities.
Okay, now watch.
You tie the ribbon in a bow, and voilà, decorative bags of almonds.
We'll make 300 to pass out at the wedding.
Wait, this is Donna's bachelorette party?
What other manual laborare we gonna do?
Huh, scrub a toilet, dig a trench, write a book?
Well, if we don't do this, who will?
I can't believe you invited me over and you don't have any dip.
Red, we're having a girl's night out.
I need you to bag all the almonds and tie 'em with a bow.
- Why me?
- 'Cause I said so.
- I don't want to.
- Well, you have to.
- Oh, you..
you make me crazy.
- Oh, you..
you make me crazy.
- Fine.
- Good.
Since you're getting married, I'll teach you how to do that.
- To Forman and Donna.
- TO FORMAN AND DONNA!
Where is Forman?
- Who cares?
!
- WHO CARES?
!
!
How did I not know about this place?
I spent my whole life trying to get girls to take their clothes off, and all I needed was $10.
You know, I don't understand why chicks don't like guys to look at strippers.
I mean, these women are artists.
It's like Leonardo..
or da Vinci.
- Bravo.
- Bravo.
Bravo.
Forman, where's your beer hand?
I chewed off the tape in the men's room.
Wait, that was you makin' those sounds?
Hey, you know, forget what I said about there being a mummy in the bathroom.
I can't stop thinking about what Donna's doing.
The only reason she's still in Point Place is 'cause of me.
If it weren't for me, she'd probably be on the other side of the World by now.
Hey, I grew up on that side of the world, and it's no picnic.
Although when you eat every meal on the ground, I suppose, technically it is a picnic.
Look, all I know is if I let Donna stay in Point Place, she's gonna miss out on all those great things she wanted to do, and it'll be all my fault.
Forman, would you quit whining?
Donna's gonna marry you.
From where I'm sittin', what's on your plate looks pretty good.
You don't cut open the sausage, Forman.
You just eat it.
Well, I wish it were that easy, Hyde, but it's a complex emotional issue Hey, Phil Donahue, live nudes.
Oh, well, now this looks like a good place for a bachelorette party.
Yeah, did you see that neon sign out front?
It had a naked man with an arrow pointing this way.
Um, I don't think that was an arrow.
Welcome to the little boy's room where every night is ladies' night..
everybody's pants come off.
Well, that's a catchy slogan.
These guys have been doing some hard time, and they're dyin' to meet some ladies.
Well, now he..
he looks like he's been a bad boy!
Take it off!
Take it off!
Is that how we do this?
I'm not sure how to be naughty in public.
Ooh!
These guys are goin' back to jail for assault with a sexy weapon.
Oh, my god, Casey?
Oh, my god, Casey!
it's just, Donna's giving up everything she ever wanted.
I can't help but feel like I'm holding her back, you know?
Okay, just so you know, I make most my money on tips.
I'm sorry.
Here, you..
y..
y..
- You should probably just take this.
- Thanks.
Forman, would you quit depressing the strippers?
When you depress the strippers, they go like this.
Yeah, this isn't some hole in the wall where hopeless losers blow their money on people who don't care about their problems.
This is a strip joint.
Yes, it is, Eric.
You're ruining the romance.
You, dance for my money!
And the rabbit runs around and then back in the hole.
Hey, Red, what do ya think of my nut bag?
Ha ha, Bob.
I'm done with this.
This is not man's work.
I mean, if Kitty wanted me to shoot the almonds at some communists, that I could do.
Oh, you're a big talker now that she's gone.
I'm not afraid of her, and I'm not doin' this, and I don't care if it means I have to sit through another one of her silent breakfasts.
- What, she just sits there?
- I talk, she just ignores me.
I had to buy a bottle of Mrs. Butterworth's just so that someone would smile at me.
You can always call me, Red.
I'd rather talk to syrup.
- So workin' at a strip club.
- Yeah.
I finally found a way to cash in on my good looks without having to humiliate myself.
No, you're not humiliating yourself.
I mean, you're not the naked guy.
You're the guy who introduces the naked guy.
Yeah.
So I'm surprised to see you're still in town.
You know, you'd always talked about gettin' outta here.
I always thought you'd be some place more glamorous by now, like Paris or Reno.
Well, I've got Eric and my job and a great place to live in and/or pull behind a car.
I mean, it's not what I expected, but it's definitely the right thing to do.
You know, that trailer is tiny, and I need room to roam.
born free as free as the..
something free you know, this town is so small, I don't even know what free is.
Yeah.
Look, listen, I've been other places, and it's not that great.
I mean, since I came back here, I've got it made..
free drinks, I can borrow any of these freaky costumes when I want.
Plus, you know, - It's showbiz.
- Yeah.
So You're happy here.
Yeah, and you will be, too.
And don't worry, you know, by the time you have a few kids, you'll probably be livin' in a much bigger trailer.
Hi.
You home already?
I thought those boys would take your clothes and leave you naked in Indiana.
You kids..
you just don't know how to do anything.
Listen, dad, Donna wants to stay in Point Place after we get married.
I..
how can that be a good idea?
Son, in this relationship, you're gonna have one instinct, and Donna's gonna have another.
Always go with hers.
If history has taught us anything, it's that you're always wrong.
What about the time that I oh, yeah, I got nothin'.
You know, being with your mother has taught me one thing.
A man can only rise to the level of the woman that he's with.
hey, what's up?
I saw a naked man's butt.
Donna, happy fifth anniversary!
Hey, I want you to put on your best dress, because there's another sequel to "Star Wars".
And Mr. and Mrs. Eric Forman are gonna be first in line.
What's goin' on?
I'm leaving you, Eric.
What?
Wh..
We could see the new Jane Fonda movie instead.
Eric, I'm miserable.
How can you let me settle for this?
But you said this is what you wanted.
Well, I was wrong.
I guess I was just trying to make you happy, and I forgot about myself.
I mean, I wanted to see the world, not the inside of a trailer.
But, Donna, I love you.
I love you, too, but it's not enough.
Good-bye, Eric.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, - Can you just take that?
- You can just squeeze through there.
- Thank you.
Hey, For-play.
- Casey?
- Yeah, your mom said I could bunk here.
But don't worry, bud, as soon as everybody's asleep, I'm gonna head over to your sister's room.
so beautiful morning, huh?
boy, these waffles look great.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Guys I have to tell you about this dream I had.
No.
Eric, I can't hear another one of your lame dreams.
"Guys, I dreamt I was purple and I could fly and Luke Skywalker was my lab partner".
No.
It was about Donna.
Okay, it was five years in the future.
Five years in the future?
Did you see Jackie?
How's she holdin' up?
Do I need to get out now?
Hyde, in my dream, Donna gave up her life plans to be with me.
And she was so miserable, she left me.
That's it ?
I took my feet off the table and turned slightly to the left for that?
Look, you guys, what if I really am holding Donna back..
and she just doesn't realize it yet?
I feel like I could be ruining both of our lives.
Eric, relax, okay?
It's just a stress dream, 'cause you're gettin' married tomorrow.
Now I had a dream last night that's worth telling.
Okay, Donna was in a wet t-shirt contest No, I can't.
Forget it.
It's too dirty.
So who's gonna be your best man?
Oh, you know what?
Why don't you guys just decide who my best man is?
Whoa, you want us to choose?
Well, if that's not an invitation to dress a dog up in a tuxedo, I don't know what it is.
All right.
If anyone should be the best man, it's me.
I'm gonna be a father, so I really need the money.
You don't get paid to be the best man.
You do it for the satisfaction of nailing the hottest bridesmaid.
It's in the bible.
Well, I can't do that, 'cause I'm bringin' Brooke.
Yeah, we're getting pretty serious.
Girls, man..
you get 'em pregnant, they get all clingy.
hey, on earth, green means go!
Gosh, I didn't know they let brain-dead morons drive cars.
And I didn't know they let brain-dead morons into the Police Academy.
Oh, they do!
Brooke?
Hi, Michael.
This is my mother.
Yeah, we..
we met.
It didn't go very well.
That 70's Show - Saison 6 - Episode 2q "Going Mobile" Here she is.
Welcome, or as I like to say, happy trailers to you.
A trailer.
Well, son, you finally made it.
Well, and..
and..
and just look at all the nature.
I mean, right in your front yard, you have a beautiful apple core.
Donna don't take offense, but a trailer?
I think you could do better.
Oh, that's funny.
I was just thinking so could my dad.
Hey, watch it, Donna.
She's wrong, Pammy.
I can't do better than you.
I've tried and failed on several occasions.
Oh, bobby.
Oh, I think I hear a chicken.
I'll be in the car.
I'll go with you.
We're in the honeymoon stage where she doesn't mind if I get handsy.
Well, I think this place is great.
You can just drive your car right up to it, and then you have a walk-in closet.
And look at our teeny, tiny bathroom.
Eric, can I talk to you privately in the living roo..
..
the, uh, dining ..
the left front quadrant?
Son living here is a real bad idea.
There's no privacy.
Where will you hide if Donna has a chore for you?
You'll have to dive under the trailer.
Honey, would you help me unload some groceries from the car?
See what I mean?
I'm cornered, like an animal..
Coming, honey.
Your life is gonna be a living hell.
So home sweet home.
Yeah.
Hey, Donna, um hey Um, don't take this the wrong way, but is this really what we want?
What?
Of course it is.
Why?
I don't know.
I just you know, it's such a big step.
And, I just really want to make sure this is what we want, what you want.
Eric, the life I want is with you.
I love you.
Yeah, I know, but..
wait a minute.
This isn't about this place.
This is about me.
No.
Are you having doubts about me?
Because if you are, tell me now.
Don't wait, like, ten years from now when we're both too fat to get dates.
No, no, no, forget it.
I'm happy.
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy.
Okay, now you're saying "happy" way too much.
Uh, because I'm very happy.
If I were less happy, I'd say it less.
I think that's how language works, Donna.
Okay.
I'm gonna go pump out the toilet.
So Forman nixed our best man idea.
Apparently you wearing a giant trench coat and standing on my shoulders isn't classy.
Not classy?
Did you tell him I'll be wearing a plastic flower that sprays water?
So let's just do rock, paper, scissors to see who the best man is, all right?
No, no, no, no.
I hate that game.
I always lose.
'Cause you always pick rock.
That's because nothing beats rock.
Paper beats rock.
Those are the rules.
Eh, not buying it.
Fine.
We'll play a new game.
How about cockroach, foot, nuclear bomb?
Foot squashes cockroach.
Nuclear bomb blows up foot.
And cockroach survives nuclear bomb.
Oh, that's great.
I'll be nuclear bomb.
Nothing beats nuclear bomb.
I just told you, cockroach beats nuclear bomb.
Oh, we'll see about that.
Laurie, it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in a wedding dress.
Make sure Eric doesn't come in.
What, you want Laurie to guard the door?
She's never kept a man out of anywhere in her entire life.
That is not true.
Jackie, watch the door.
So Donna, rehearsal dinner tonight, wedding tomorrow, you excited?
Um, actually, I'm a little nervous.
Oh, that's just cold feet.
Yeah, but here's the thing-- whenever anyone's nervous about marriage, everyone says it's just cold feet.
But half of all marriage send in divorce, so half of those people getting married should have cold feet.
But by the time they realize their feet were right, it's too late.
Too late!
How do I know what to do?
There is no answer!
I can't breathe.
How you feel is totally normal.
A lot of the guys that I'm dating were nervous before their weddings, but now they're all happily married.
You do make a mother proud.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Cockroach beats nuclear bomb.
That is 38 wins in a row.
I think it's safe to say that I'm the best man.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I just noticed something.
Cockroach always wins.
One more time, for all the marbles.
Fine.
One, two, three.
Foot, I forgot about foot.
So foot always wins.
One more time.
Winner, best man, period.
One, two, three.
Bomb?
!
Nuclear bomb beat foot.
It's like everything in this game loses to something else!
Yes, it's exactly like that.
Wait, except aha.
I was so blind.
Nuclear bomb beats everything.
One more time, winner take all.
One, two, three.
I'm going home.
Boy, wish I had a dollar for every awkward lunch I've had with my mom and a strange guy that knocked me up.
come on, guys, we have to get past this.
- The baby's coming in a month.
- Oh, and Michael's willing to wait that long.
I'm surprised he doesn't just honk his horn and try to scare it out in a week.
Hey, if I wanted to scare a baby, I wouldn't honk.
I'd wear a mask and make ghost sounds.
You were still rude.
I think it's common courtesy to wait Pass the rolls, please.
Pass the rolls, please.
I will, but I feel it's common courtesy to wait 30 seconds before passing the rolls.
Hey, I just remembered there's another room here.
So, Michael, I haven't told Brooke yet, but I'm here to take her home to Chicago to have the baby and live with me.
What?
No, but I'm not in Chicago.
That's its major attraction.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the lake?
Jackie, do you think Eric and I are making a mistake?
You are.
But Eric's just praying this whole thing goes through before you notice.
No, I'm serious.
Up until now, everything in our relationship has been really great..
our first date, our first kiss, even getting engaged.
But now, in the pit of my stomach, I feel really sick.
Come on, Donna, you and Eric are meant to be together.
You're like a fat girl and a cat.
It just works, you know?
Oh, come on.
All right, look, I'm gonna go pick up my dress.
And I'm gonna try not to look prettier than you, but I can't promise.
Oh, god, I can't do this.
Okay, let's get a picture of the wedding party.
Oh, mom, would you fix your top?
This isn't "playboy".
She's fine.
Don't fuss with her.
Kitty, correct me if I'm wrong, but at a wedding rehearsal, isn't it tradition for the bride and groom to..
well, you know, show up?
Red, they will show up.
Everything is just fine.
Eric better have a good reason for being late.
There's only two acceptable excuses for tardiness in a Pinciotti household.
One..
traffic was terrible.
Two..
I should have left earlier, but I was doin' somethin'.
Well, Donna's not here either.
Oh, maybe her new house ran out of gas.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, good, They're here.
I told you everything would be fine.
Eric and Donna are here.
What?
No, Eric's not with me.
He's not here ?
Oh, maybe he's stuck in traffic.
What traffic?
90% of this town's population is in this room.
Look, you can't take Brooke to Chicago.
We're gonna raise our baby together here, - Okay?
We had it all figured out.
- Oh, really?
So where were you going to live?
Are you planning to get married?
And who's gonna stay home with the baby?
No, tha..
we figured out other stuff, like she's gonna be the one that does the breast-feeding.
And then if someone needs to go bowling, I'll do it.
Now I appreciate your concern, but I'm gonna do what's best for my kid.
Well, then think, Michael.
You're going away to the Police Academy for the next six months.
You don't have the time to help Brooke raise a baby.
I do, and I have a house and a backyard and an extra bedroom, and I love Brooke more than anything in the world.
How can that not be what's best for her?
So, um how's the big argument going?
All right, Brooke, um your mom and I thought that, um maybe since I'm gonna be at Police Academy, that you might wanna have the baby in Chicago.
You know, just so you have your mom there.
Just for now.
Oh, my god, Michael.
Thank you so much.
I'll come visit, and it'll be great.
What do you know?
You're a gentleman.
And your daughter's a lady, all except for the bathroom sex that resulted in our child.
Kitty, Eric is over two hours late.
Let's go home.
He's not late, Mr. Forman.
He didn't show up because he doesn't want to marry me.
Hey, you don't know that.
Maybe he's just playing hard to get.
I'm gonna make him pay for this.
I'm not strong, but I know a lot of ways to destroy men emotionally.
I can vouch for that.
Okay, okay.
Let's just..
let's turn those frowns upside down.
I know.
I know.
We'll all go back to my house and enjoy the Mexican fiesta I prepared.
I probably won't serve the tiny wedding cakes, since nobody's getting married.
But there are three kinds of burritos.
Donna, in troubled times like this, I have a friend I like to turn to..
gooseberry gloss lipstick.
Nobody can feel sad with full, juicy, red lips.
Okay, no offense,but I don't think your lipstick is gonna help me, because I am not a superficial jerk!
Better.
How could Eric do this to me?
I mean, what kind of a horrible person skips out on someone they've known their whole life?
I mean, someone they're supposed to love?
Uh-huh.
Um, Donna, why is your suitcase in the backseat?
Huh?
Oh, I was just..
I don't know.
I thought may..
Hey, I showed up, okay?
!
what the hell are we gonna do with all these bride and groom cookies?
Give me the groom.
Well, did you find Eric?
No, and the Cruiser's gone.
I also noticed that he took his retainer.
So it's probably gonna be an overnighter.
And I couldn't find him either.
I followed a trail of candy wrappers, and it just circled back around to me.
Donna, I know how difficult this is for you.
Now I've been with a lot of men in my life..
rich men, poor men..
well, not poor, upper middle-class.
My point is, none of them ever loved me the way I know Eric loves you.
Well, thanks, Pamela, but if Eric loved me, he'd be here right now.
Oh, hey, kitty, listen, I think I'm just gonna take Donna home and call it a night.
Oh, don't you dare.
We need to act like everything is normal.
Keep the party going.
Keep Donna happy.
Didn't you have a speech to give?
- Kitty, I don't think it's still appropriate..
- Okay, bob's got a speech.
Everybody, listen to Bob's speech.
Speech!
Speech!
I guess I could change a few things as I go along.
"To the lovely bride and the handsome bride" "I know that one of you will make yourself very happy".
"Your life will surely be enriched by all the time you spend with ..
alone..
"You are truly one soul becoming one joined alone forever".
"So I don't look at this as the day I lose a daughter".
"I look at this as the day I gain ..
nobody".
Salut.
Hello.
Yeah, we kinda figured.
Uh-huh.
Well, do you wanna talk to her?
She sittin' right here.
Okay.
Wrong number.
Hyde, what did he say?
- He said he's really sorry.
- He's sorry?
He left me the day before our wedding, and he's sorry?
What..
what does that mean?
It means he's not coming.
Not tonight, not to the wedding.
He's gone.
Man, I am glad to be here.
I have had a rough day.
Being around all this love and happiness oughta cheer me right up.
I mean, this is a happy day.
Look at all the love.
Wait, hey, where's Eric?
I can't believe Forman took off, man.
That's not like him at all.
Usually he ruins things by staying.
- So, steven, you know, since the church is booked already, you think maybe we - No!
- Oh, come on!
Look, Eric jilts Donna and all you guys can talk about is yourselves.
Well, there are bigger issues here, people.
Donna is single.
Whoo-hoo!
Wait a minute.
I get it now.
Cockroach beats everything.
Let's play, and I warn you, I'm going to be cockroach.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
uh-huh.
Red.
Red!
Cousin Alice wants to know why Eric and Donna's wedding is off.
Well, just tell her what your son did.
Oh, now he's my son, just like when he told us he wanted to be a jazz dancer.
Well, he's our son, red.
No son of mine would humiliate his family by running off on his fiancée.
Alice?
The wedding is off because Eric is gay.
You're right..
Everybody knew except him.
Eric is a mental midget.
And you know what else?
He runs like a girl.
Bob, you run like a girl.
Only when I'm scared of something.
Oh, honey, I'm sure Eric has a good explanation.
On the several occasions, I didn't show up for one of my weddings, I always called to say I had appendicitis.
Well, Eric's not here.
My little girl's unhappy, and I wanna punch somebody.
Bob, you don't want to fight.
I've known you for a long time, and I know what you really want is a piece of cake.
A piece of cake, Kitty?
My daughter is devastated, and you offer me cake?
You just tell me one thing..
is it chocolate?
Devil's food.
I can have it on the table in less than a minute.
Eh.
Let's do that, then.
Okay, um, guys, Donna's on her way over, and she knows we all know why Eric left, and she wants some answers.
Well, I'm not gonna tell her.
Give Donna bad news, and she hits.
She wasn't on the boys' J.V.Wrestling team for nothing.
Okay, well, I can't do it.
The last person a girl wants to hear bad news from is a woman who has it all.
Well, you can count me out.
I won't face a girl when I ditch her.
I'm not gonna do it when somebody else does.
Well, I'm not telling her, either.
I don't want my personal parts damaged.
I mean, they're practically brand-new.
Well, in a dead lock such as this, we're forced to turn to our judicial code, which clearly states, that in the event of bad news being delivered in reference to a cancelled wedding, the foreigner does it.
Ah, yes-- the immigration conversation act.
Where the hell is Eric, and why did he do this to me?
Um, okay, um Eric was afraid getting married and staying here was a mistake you know, because you would be giving up your dream of traveling the world and becoming a ball-breaking feminist.
- Jackie, don't push!
- You don't push!
- Hey, hey.
Hey!
Knock it off before Fez gets hurt.
Look, I just want to say that we're all really sorry.
How could Eric ditch me the night before our wedding without saying one word?
Look, would it make you feel better if I told you that Eric left a note?
- He left a note?
- No.
But you should hold on to that feeling.
That 70's show - Saison 6 - Episode 25 "The Seeker" Eric.
what a dink, right?
You know, I had to call everybody and tell them the wedding's off.
The only good thing is, there's a rumor going around that he's gay, which is nice.
Look, man, I mean, I know you're mad, but you know, Forman was trying to do the right thing.
He just did it in the wrong way.
Yeah, but, Hyde, I don't care why he did it.
I mean, I can't ever forgive him.
When I called my mom, I just cried and cried.
Really?
I can't see you crying.
I've seen Forman crying.
He does a lot of "shut up!
I'm not crying"!
- I want to be mad.
Don't make me laugh.
- Oh!
Whoa!
Oh, my god!
Hyde, are you okay?
I'm too old for this crap!
Why am I stronger than all the guys I hang out with?
You look dorky.
Hyde, I am so sorry.
I don't know my own strength.
I mean, I guess I'm still all bulked up from J.V. Wrestling.
You know what?
This isn't my fault.
This is Eric's fault for taking off.
Hey, look at the bright side.
Now I can spy on you from Eric's empty bedroom instead of climbing up a tree where there's no place to put my juice box.
Man, I can't believe I missed you falling out of the water tower.
So I'm at home, and I'm watching "scooby-doo," and I think to myself, "you know what?
You should go and hang out with Hyde and Donna".
And then I think, "no, because maybe scooby and shaggy found a real ghost this time".
But it wasn't.
It was just another crazy old guy.
Oh, Steven, I heard what happened.
- And you brought me flowers?
- No, these are for me.
My boyfriend fell off the water tower.
So what, Donna, you're alone, and you want me to be alone, too?
Okay, Steven, get on home.
I'll take care of you later.
Trade you a kiss for a lollipop.
I don't need that baby crap.
Oh, look at all this glorious wedding food.
Do you, Fez, take this pizza roll?
I do.
You know what part of falling off the water tower I like?
The part right after you fall until the part where you hit the ground.
Yeah.
And then that part right after you crash where you're just kind of vibrating there?
Oh, yeah!
That was cool, too.
Yeah, and the second time you fall, it'll be even better, 'cause you know what to expect.
You know, so you can enjoy it, like, do a flip or something.
Oh, a flip would be awesome!
Man, I'm so glad you fell off the water tower.
Look at this.
Eric's gone, and I'm left with the flying stupid-ass-insky brothers.
- Mom?
- MIDGE!
!
Oh, you sounded so sad on the phone, I just had to come.
We missed you so much.
All right.
All right.
Donna, quit hogging your mom!
I know something very interesting about someone we know very well.
No, no.
None of your supermarket gossip.
If half of what you say is true, everybody in this town would have V.D. Well, I was going over Steven's file when he was at the hospital, and you know his father?
I believe I had the pleasure of him writing me a hot check.
Of course, in his defense, he was drunk.
Well, Well, according to Steven's birth certificate, that's not his father.
This is so exciting!
Steven has a different father that he doesn't know about-- maybe a nice father.
Maybe a sober father.
Well, we don't want him to be entirely sober.
You know how those people are.
Mom, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're here.
Well, there are times when a mother has to be there for her baby, like now and, I guess, when she's born.
You know, Mrs. Pinciotti, in my younger days, I had quite the crush on you even though I knew nothing could ever happen.
But now that I'm older, and I'm gonna be a father soon, if anything does happen, we gotta keep it quiet.
Steven, you're late.
Where..
Midge!
Hey..
what a surprise.
Huh.
I should probably return these earrings I didn't know were yours.
Midge, what are you doing here?
I came to see Donna.
Who's the amazon?
Oh, this is my, uh, friend.
"Friend"?
I don't think so.
Hi, I'm Pam, the best thing that ever happened to him.
I'm Midge, the second best thing that ever happened to him.
Dad, I invited her to stay with us.
Your mom is staying with us?
No, your mom is staying with us.
- What about my mom?
- Well, that's not my mom, that's your mom.
I'm confused.
Who am I sleeping with?
Steven, we need to talk to you about something pretty important.
Look, whatever you found in my room was planted there.
- No.
We..
- what's in your room?
- Red, stay focused.
- Yeah, stay focused.
All right, Steven, just for the record, I told her to mind her own business, and then she said, "fine, you can make your own dinner".
So..
ha ha..
here we are.
No.
No, no.
No.
Steven, we found out that the man you think is your father isn't really your father.
Your real father's name is William Barnett, and he lives in Milwaukee.
Oh, my god!
Steven, this is so exciting!
You have a whole new family, which is great, because I hate your family!
Steven, I know you have a lot of feelings and emotions, and maybe you want to cry.
We won't tell if you cry.
I'll tell.
Yeah, I don't like guys that cry.
Will you two please?
Steven, are you okay?
Well, I..
don't really know the guy who's supposed to be my dad, and obviously, I don't know this new guy, - ..
so I don't really care.
- Oh, but, Steven, you have to care!
What if your new dad is something amazing like a doctor or the guy who owns "the love boat"?
That didn't go well.
What did you want to happen?
Well, I thoughthe would be happy to hear about his dad.
We all go to Milwaukee, and then his his rich, new father would be so thrilled to see him, he'd buy me a fur coat.
Bob, could you pass the syrup?
You're gonna give her the syrup?
The syrup we share every morning?
The syrup that stands for everything that we are as a man and a woman?
I was gonna but I won't.
I will later.
No, I won't.
How's it going?
Your father's an ass.
Oh, something we agree on.
It's not going that well.
Okay, I find this whole thing very disturbing.
I was left at the altar, and all I can think about is what's my dad doing, who's he doing it with and if I walk through that door, am I gonna see it?
Well, whatever he's doing, he's doing with me, and we're doing it everywhere, so..
knock.
So after we left, Steven said he didn't want to talk about his new dad in Milwaukee, and he didn't.
And he wasn't not talking about it to be bitchy, like I would.
He really didn't want to talk about it.
Well, I don't like the way he just walked out after we told him the news.
Why would he do that?
Because he's a man, Kitty and he knows you want him to cry, but he won't, because crying is for babies and Italians.
And I think we all just need to stay outta his business.
Steven, you're all dressed up.
are you gonna propose?
No.
I, uh I thought I'd head out to Milwaukee.
By yourself?
Yeah, I guess.
So I'll see you guys later, then.
Well, uh we were just, uh, talking about going to Milwaukee..
for their famous honey buns.
Well, you guys could come along, I guess.
Well, I'm..
I'm sure in the mood for a..
honey bun.
And to see baby go home to his daddy!
So midge wanted you to pass the syrup and Pam wouldn't let you.
That's interesting.
What do you think it means?
I think it means you got a shot at something only rock stars and professional athletes get.
Free passes to Disneyland?
No, Fez, two ladies at the same time.
Ah, screw Disneyland.
That's a much better ride.
Think I could really keep both of them?
May I say from experience, when you're dealing with two ladies, the end won't be pretty, but the ride down is super fun.
I don't know what to do, mom.
I mean, I always thought Eric and I would be together, and he blew it.
- Maybe you'll work it out.
- Well, I don't want to work it out.
I want to push his face in the dirt like we did when we were kids.
You know what?
I never should have stopped doing that.
Donna, just forgive him.
How?
Give me one good reason.
Oh, honey, I can't give you a rational reason.
There probably isn't one.
But if you love him, and you don't want to be without him, you have to forgive him.
I was too hard headed to forgive your father, and I wish I had.
Aw, Midge.
- You want to take a walk?
- Sure!
I'll drive.
Did you see that?
Maybe someone will have a happy ending.
And then another beginning and another ending, because he's got two ladies!
Bob Pinciotti, a street kid outta nowhere, gets a shot at the title.
You know what?
He's like..
He's like the rocky of bagging two ladies.
It's a big day, meeting your father for the first time.
- Mmm.
- You bet.
A big day for my big guy, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- So how you doing?
I'm fine.
Oh, you doing all right, baby?
Just quit!
Stop!
Stop!
Keep it down.
This isn't your parole office.
Mr. Barnett will see you now.
Okay.
Okay.
This is it.
Jackie, here's the camera.
Take a picture of Steven the minute he sees his father.
If he cries, and you miss it, I will hurt you.
Um, where's Steven?
He left.
Yeah.
I saw him go, and I didn't say anything on purpose.
All right, let's go..
Come on.
- Kitty!
- I came all this way.
I want my fur coat.
- Who's there?
Who's there?
- Ow!
Ow!
Jeez, Donna, stop!
Oh, god.
I didn't know it was you.
- You dirtbag!
How could you do that?
You just left me there!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I freaked out, okay?
I tried to talk to you about it, but I couldn't, and I..
I didn't know what to do.
All I knew was that I Donna, I think we were about to make a huge mistake.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I had a bad feeling, too.
But here's the difference..
I stayed.
Look, Donna, please please forgive me.
I don't know.
I mean, my mom said I should, but I don't know.
Listen to me.
I am so sorry.
Okay, whatever you want to do, we'll do, okay?
Just..
just tell me what to do.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.
Just get in.
Really?
Won't you let me walk you home from school thanks for coming back.
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
If it's so well, let me know I just want to say let me know, well, I can go and I'll take you that was beautiful.
What the Glad you're back.
Here's a bill for the wedding you didn't show up for.
$6,000?
Mm-hmm.
I added on a grand for pain and suffering.
Thanks, daddy.
Buy yourself something nice with it.
I suggest a new boyfriend.
Okay !
