{START OF EPISODE 1}
Anything?
Ah!
"Introduction to the Modern Novel.
A survey study of 20th-century novelists".
- "Open to freshmen".
You might like that.
- "Introduction to the Modern Novel"?
I'm guessing I'd probably have to read the modern novel.
Maybe more than one.
I like books.
I just don't wanna take on too much.
Do they have an "Introduction to the Modern Blurb"?
- Oh!
"Short Story"!
- Well, that's good.
- Oh, no.
It conflicts with psych.
- Maybe I shouldn't take psych.
You gotta.
It's fun, and you can use it as your science requirement.
Anyway, Professor Walsh is supposed to be great.
She's, like, world-renowned.
How do you get to be renowned?
I mean, like, do you have to be "nowned" first?
Yes.
First there's the painful nowning process.
Wait!
"Images of Pop Culture".
This is good.
They watch movies, TV shows, even commercials.
For credit?
- Isn't college cool?
- How did I miss that one?
Well, you did sort ofwait till the last minute with your course selection.
Sorry, Miss l-Chose-My-Major-in-Playgroup.
That's an exaggeration.
I just, you know, think it's good to be prepared.
Don't wanna be caught unawares.
I've been busy!
It's been a very slay-heavy summer.
I just haven't had a whole lot oftime to think about life at UC Sunnydale.
- It's exciting, though, isn't it?
- Yeah!
- It's gonna be an adjustment.
- Yeah, it's, like, five miles away.
It's uncharted territory.
Giles said I have to be Secret ldentity Gal again.
- That makes sense.
- It's gonna be tough, though.
- With a roommate.
- Yeah.
I'm psyched about college.
Definitely.
I just need to figure out how it's gonna work with my extracurricular activities.
I just can't let it take the edge off my slaying.
I gotta stay sharp.
Is this guy ever gonna wake up?
Sometimes At the back ofmymind Freshmen!
We're doing this by folder colour!
Ifyou're not holding on to a yellow folder, you're in the wrong group.
You belong up by Weisman Hall.
They gotta hear us!
We're not gonna take it!
- What do we want?
- Booze!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
Rally tomorrow night.
Let the administration know how we feel.
Right.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal saviour?
I meant to, and then I just got really busy.
Party Thursday at Alpha Delt.
Free Jell-O shots for freshmen women.
Do you guys know where Weisman Hall is?
- Buffy!
Hey!
- Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!
Isn't this cool?
There's so much going on.
Yeah.
Almost, one might say, too much.
I got all my courses except for Modern Poetry.
I had to switch to Ethnomusicology.
But that's cool.
West African drumming.
I think it's gonna change everything.
- Have you met your roommate yet?
- No.
- Me neither.
I hope she's cool.
- I see you got ticketed, too.
Yes!
I've heard about five different issues and I'm angry about every one ofthem.
- What'd you get?
- Jell-O shots.
I didn't get Jell-O shots!
I'll trade you for a "Take Back the Night"?
Are we near Weisman Hall?
I still need to get my ID card.
I got mine this morning.
The lines are really long now.
You should've gone early.
Well, I hope that I learn from this experience and that I grow.
- I'm being annoying, aren't l?
- No.
It's nice that you're excited.
It's just in high school, knowledge was pretty much frowned upon.
You really had to work to learn anything.
But here, the energy, the collective intelligence, it's like this force, this penetrating force, and I can just feel my mind opening up.
And letting this place just thrust into and spurt knowledge into That sentence ended up in a different place than it started out in.
I'm with you, though.
I'm all for spurty knowledge.
It's just It's a little overwhelming.
Don't you feel it?
Well, I'm Ooh, boyfriend!
It's my on-campus boyfriend!
Oh no, I forgot to pick mine up.
The line's probably really long now, too.
- How are you?
- Good.
It's a madhouse, a madhouse.
I know, I was just saying that to Willow.
It's so overwhelming.
- Don't you feel completely disoriented?
- Oz!
- Hey, Paul.
- Finally matriculating with us.
Very cool!
- Tell me you're playing this week!
- Thursday, Alpha Delt.
- I have that one!
- I'm bringing the wrecking crew.
- Jell-O shots?
- Good.
Where do you get the work-study applications?
Back of Richmond Hall, next to the auditorium.
- Thanks.
See ya, bro.
- Go get 'em.
Well, the band's played here a lot.
It's still all new.
I don't know what the hell's going on.
Hey, Doug!
Library Ooh, library.
Come on.
It's too bad Giles couldn't be librarian here.
Be convenient.
Well, he says he's enjoying being a gentleman of leisure.
Gentleman of leisure?
lsn't that British for unemployed?
Uh-huh.
He's a slacker now.
Speaking of slack, have you heard from Xander?
Not for a while.
He's still on his cross-country see-America thing.
He said he wasn't coming back until he had driven to all 50 states.
- Did you explain about Hawaii?
- Well, he seemed so determined.
Hope he gets back soon.
It'd be fun to have the whole gang back together.
Hang out in the Iibrary.
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!
lsn't this amazing?
It's cosy.
You know, I never wanted to hurt Giles's feelings, but, occult books aside, our old libraryjust didn't have the greatest selection.
But this?
Yeah, this is great, you know, ifwe ever need a place for the Nuremberg rallies.
This is a real library.
See, we even have to whisper.
It's like a whole new world.
- Here.
- Thanks.
I can't wait till Mom gets the bill.
I hope it's a funny aneurysm.
"Introduction to Psychology".
- Oh, up there.
- I'll get 'em.
- This discriminates against short people.
- Oh, I think there's a protest next week.
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- I'm OK.
It's OK.
- Well, that was bracing.
- I'm so The books were just too high, and then everything was bad.
Let me give you a hand.
Let's put a few ofthese down here.
So are you girls taking lntro Psych, or do you just want me dead?
Uh-huh.
I mean, the first one.
You'll have fun.
Professor Walsh, she's quite a character.
- You've taken it?
- I'm a TA.
I'll be helping the professor out.
I've forgotten my manners in all the concussion.
I'm Riley.
- Willow.
And this is my friend Buffy.
- Nice to meet you both.
I'm nice to meet.
Will we be studying operant conditioning in the first semester?
I hear that's kind of Professor Walsh's specialty.
Absolutely.
You know her treatise on Dietrich's work?
I know ofit.
It's a fascinating read, ifyou're into that sort ofthing.
- They have it here.
- Oh, where?
I'll show you.
I don't meet many freshmen that know much about psychology.
- Well, it's fascinating.
- Yeah, you know, cos everyone's got a brain.
Or, almost everyone.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi!
Are you Buffy?
- Yeah.
- Kathy.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah!
So, it's, uh it's a pretty nice room, huh?
Mmm!
I was surprised, cos you hear horror stories about freshmen housing.
- You took the right side.
- Yeah.
- But, you know, ifyou want it - No, no.
I just wanted to make sure that's what you wanted.
- You excited for classes tomorrow?
- Painfully.
I bet there's gonna be a lot of parties to go to this week, too.
Not that I'm a crazy partyer.
And I'm not always this hyper, either.
I'm just excited.
Yeah.
Me too.
I am really glad they put me with somebody cool.
I can tell that you're cool.
I just know that this whole year is gonna be super fun!
The point ofthis course is not to critique popular American culture.
It is not to pick at it, or look down upon it.
And it is not to watch videos for credit.
- The point is to examine - Do you know ifthis class is full yet?
And there are two people talking at once, and I know that one ofthem is me, and the other is a blonde girl.
You.
Blonde girl.
Stand up.
I'm very excited to hear what you have to say that's worth interrupting my lecture for.
I was just asking ifthe class was still open.
If I could still sign up.
Ifyour name isn't on this sheet, then you are wasting everyone's time.
- Are you on the sheet?
- They told me that if l Do you understand?
You are sucking energy from everyone in this room.
Theycame here to learn.
Get out!
I didn't mean to suck.
Leave!
Thank you.
Ifyou're looking for psych, it's through here.
Oh, thanks.
- How's your head?
- Sorry?
Yesterday.
In the bookstore.
- You don't remember.
- Oh, no, sure, I remember you.
- You're Willow's friend.
- Yeah.
My head's fine.
Itjust stung for a bit and I lost most of my basic motor functions.
It's no biggie.
We're here.
- I'm sorry.
I'm trying to remember your - Buffy.
- Buffy.
Right.
Have fun today, OK?
- Thanks.
You know, I was just wondering.
Professor Walsh isn't planning on yelling at me and kicking me out ofthe class, is she?
- It's not in her lesson plan.
- Great!
- How was Pop Culture?
- I decided not to take it.
It seemed dull.
OK.
This is Psych 105, lntroduction to Psychology.
I am Professor Walsh.
Those who fall into my good graces will come to know me as Maggie.
Those who don't will come to know me by the name my TAs use and think I don't know: the Evil Bitch Monster of Death.
Make no mistake, I run a hard class, I talk fast and I expect you to keep up.
Ifyou're looking to coast, I recommend Geology 101.
That's where the football players are.
- Sorry.
- No, I wasn't looking.
Did you, uh, lose your way?
Me?
No, no.
I'm just going to Fischer Hall, which I know is on the earth planet.
- Recently voted most pathetic.
Uh-huh.
- Well, I'm lost, and I have a map.
So Oh!
I come in second.
- I'm Buffy, by the way.
- Eddie.
OK, so - So that's Fischer Hall, right?
- OK, and this is Dunworth Building.
That's my dorm.
It's just it's us I can't find.
- Are we the blue part?
- No.
- Yes.
- So if I came from there, then we would just wanna go that way to the bike path.
You sound very certain.
I'm in.
Are you taking Psych 105 with Professor Walsh?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm gonna try.
She's not afraid ofthe long words, huh?
She's pretty intense.
A lot ofthe courses are really tough.
I'm a little upset.
I had it on good authority that this was a party school.
I think it's supposed to get easier.
I still feel like carrying around a security blanket.
OfHuman Bondage.
Have you ever read it?
Oh, I'm not really into porn.
I'm trying to cut way back.
No.
There's no actual bondage, it's just a novel.
I've read it, like, ten times.
I always keep it by my bed.
Security blanket.
I don't really have a security blanket.
Unless, of course, you count Mr Pointy.
Mr Pointy?
Oh.
Bike path.
It's nice to know that I'm not the only entirely confused person on this campus.
- I suspect there's a lot of us.
- I'll look for you in psych.
Yeah.
We can help each other figure out what they're talking about.
- OK.
- Maybe even make it through the year.
- Good night.
- Night.
I'm sorry.
Did you lose your way?
- You looking for someone?
- Yeah.
You made a friend?
Good for you!
Thanks, Mom.
Yeah, Eddie just took off.
Packed his stuff, left a note.
Happens sometimes.
People just can't handle it.
There's always a few kids who lose it early in the first semester and just bail.
Weak ones, I guess.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring boring.
Boring.
Astonishingly boring.
We We have to kill cooler people.
Will somebody remind me?
You were the one who said pick on the weak ones.
Thin the herd and all that.
Does this sweater make me look fat?
No, the fact that you're fat makes you look fat.
That sweaterjust makes you look purple.
You're such a loser.
Hey, words can hurt like a fist.
Hey!
Check it out!
Well?
Do we have a Klimt?
- Yes!
- Big score for Klimt!
Monet still well in the lead, but look out for Team Klimt, coming from behind.
Freshmen.
Man, they're so predictable.
And you can never eatjust one.
- Yeah, I'm hungry!
- What a shock.
- We eat when I say we eat.
- Well, we could hit the tunnels We eat when I say we eat!
God, lighten up!
I think it's funny when you scream.
It's like Whoa!
I gotta get me some better lackeys, I swear.
You guys are useless.
- I shouldn't take you on the hunt.
- Great!
Let dead Eddie get your dinner!
That's pretty much the plan.
Giles?
Rupert, is this blue cheese or is itjust cheese that's gone blue?
You're not Giles.
You know, the door was open, so I just - Giles does still live here, right?
- He does.
He appears.
Rupert, you have a guest.
Buffy.
Hello.
Is this a bad time?
No.
Oh, forgive me.
This is Olivia.
She's, er, an old friend.
She's staying over for a few days.
Couldn't pass through sunny Cal without looking up old Ripper.
Buffy's, um was a student of mine.
And how is university?
Pretty much the same as high school, in the sense of I need help.
Ah, help.
Yes.
But this just looks like a bad time.
No, you guys talk.
I'll just go slip into something a little less comfortable.
So, trouble with - studies?
- This is a bad time.
- You keep saying that.
- It looks pretty bad!
Someone had a little too much free time on their hands.
- I'm not supposed to have a private life?
- No!
Because you're very, very old, and it's gross.
Well, before I succumb to the ravages of age, why don't you tell me what brings you here?
- There's a student missing.
- Yes?
Eddie.
He's supposed to have left school, but I just don't think he did.
I met him last night, then I went back where we met, and it looked like there had been a struggle.
- And?
- And we need to stop this!
Eddie's RA said kids disappear a lot.
There could be vampires working the campus.
- We need research and charts and stuff.
- I still don't see where I fit in.
You haven't described anything that you can't do yourself.
OK, remember before you became Hugh Hefner, when you used to be a watcher?
Officially you no longer have a watcher.
Buffy, I'll always be here when you need me.
Your safety is more important than anything, but you'll have to take care ofyourself.
You're out of school and I can't always be there to guide you.
- I'm sorry to bug you.
- Buffy Oh, no.
I mean, yeah, you're you're right.
I can handle this.
It's just l I'm on it.
I am here ifyou need me.
- She's gone?
- Yes.
- So, did you help her?
- I'm not sure.
How am I supposed to hunt in this mob?
Don't you people have homes?
Eddie?
Eddie!
Eddie, hey!
Wait up.
God, I was worried something had happened to you.
And of course it has, because you're a vampire.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.
The Slayer!
Wow.
Um, I heard you might be coming here.
This is I mean, what a challenge.
The Slayer.
- And you are?
- I'm Sunday.
I'll be killing you here in a minute or so.
That threat gets more frightening every time I hear it.
Are we gonna fight?
Or is there just gonna be a monster sarcasm rally?
I'm in for a piece.
Everybody gets to play.
Guys, this is totally mine.
OK, but you gotta share the eatin'.
Cos I'm thinking Slayer's blood's gotta be - whoa!
- Iike Thai stick.
Aren't people supposed to get smarter in college?
I think you had misconceptions about college.
Like anyone would be caught dead wearing that.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you fight like a girl.
Freshmen!
No, no, no, no, no!
The best part was when you ragged on her clothes.
She was like "No!
Not the ensemble"!
Those jeans?
With the little patches?
She has no one to blame but herself.
I heard they're coming back.
Not if I kill every single person who wears them.
You shoulda let us have a piece.
We could've finished her off.
She's not gonna last the night.
She's a done deal.
In fact, guys, you're gonna hit the tunnels.
Mom?
- Buffy.
- Hi.
- Honey, how are you?
- I'm OK.
How's college?
Have you been fighting?
Oh, they started it.
Just as long as you're being careful.
I really didn't think you'd show here for a while.
Oh, I didn't have classes today and everything's been so hectic I figured it'd be nice to crash for Oh, well, yeah.
I didn't think you'd be back for a couple ofweeks.
But I didn't move anything.
It's still your room.
- You filled it with packing crates.
- Yeah, but I didn't move anything.
If it's still my room, shouldn't I be able to fit in it?
Well, it's just for a couple ofweeks while we do inventory at the gallery.
I just really didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Neither did l. Hello?
Hello?
We are Electricity Conducting sparks Shower with me We made this about We made this about You and me You and me The whole world in front of her and she comes back to this dive.
- Xander!
- Hey, Buff.
- When did you get back?
- Couple days ago.
Freak of nature!
Why didn't you call me?
You were starting the college adventure and I didn't want to, you know, help you move.
I missed you.
How was your trip?
ls America nice?
I hear it's nice.
There's some purple mountains majesty, I have to say.
What'd you do?
What'd you see?
- Well - Tell me!
- Grand Canyon!
- You saw the Grand Canyon!
Well, I saw the movie Grand Canyon on cable.
Really lame.
Basically, I got as far as Oxnard and the engine fell out of my car.
And that was literally.
So I washed dishes at the fabulous Ladies Nightclub for about a month and a half while I tried to pay for the repairs.
No one bothered me or even spoke to me until one of the male strippers called in sick, and no power on earth will make me tell you the rest ofthat story.
Suffice to say I traded my car for one that wasn't entirely made of rust, came home to my loving parents, where everything was exactly as it was, except I sleep in the basement and I have to pay rent.
- How's college?
- Male strippers.
No power on this earth.
OK.
- College is good.
- OK, once more with even less feeling.
No, really!
I mean, Willow's in heaven and Oz has this really cool house off-campus with the band.
And you're sitting here alone at the Bronze looking like you have cancer ofthe puppy.
It's just there was this vampire and she took me down, and I just - I don't know how to stop her.
- Then where's the gang?
- Avengers assemble!
Let's get it going!
- No, I don't wanna bug them.
I mean, they're just starting school and they don't need this.
OK, Buff, what's the what here?
It's just, what if I can't cut it?
Can't cut what?
Slaying?
Slaying.
Everything.
This is all about fear.
It's understandable, but you can't let it control you.
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to anger.
No, wait, hold on.
Fear leads to hate.
Hate leads to the dark side.
Hold on, no.
First you get the women, then you get the money, then you OK, can we forget that?
Thanks for the Dadaist pep talk.
I feel much more abstract now.
The point is, you're Buffy.
- Yeah.
Maybe in high school I was Buffy.
- And now in college you're Betty Louise?
Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnick of East Cupcake, Illinois.
I might as well be.
Buffy, I've gone through some fairly dark times in my life, faced some scary things.
Among them the kitchen at the fabulous Ladies Nightclub.
Let me tell you something.
When it's dark and I'm all alone, and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever, I always think "What would Buffy do"?
You're my hero.
OK, sometimes when it's dark and I'm all alone, I think "What is Buffy wearing"?
That'd be one ofthose things you never ever tell me about?
It's a deal.
Let's put this bitch in the ground.
What do you say?
I think I say thank you.
And nothing says thank you like dollars in the waistband.
OK, what do we do first?
Kids disappearing every year.
Not too many.
Just enough so that everyone thinks they up and left.
I can't believe the vampires took your stuff.
Murder I expect, but petty larceny seems so petty.
They have to be keeping it somewhere.
On campus or at least nearby.
Hey, how far back do the disappearances go?
They weren't too common before '82.
Magic number!
Check this out.
"Psi Theta loses its charter.
Building to be closed for renovation".
"Former Psi Theta house lies dormant while issues drag on before the city council".
- We have a winner.
- Looks pretty cherry.
You up for a little reconnaissance?
- Where we all sculpt and paint and stuff?
- No, that was the Renaissance.
Oh.
I've had a really long week.
Let's go look at the house.
Score!
Oh!
That's my skirt!
You're never gonna fit in it with those hips!
We have to kill them.
- We need weapons.
- I don't see my weapons trunk there.
It was right by my bed.
Mr Gordo?
Go to my room.
If it's not there, try Willow's.
I'll keep an eye My diary?
!
Uh-oh.
Score.
I'll hurry.
Laugh all you want.
This time we play it my way.
And the rules are gonna be Say, don't I know you from beating the crap outta you?
I just thought I'd drop in.
Get it?
Drop in?
Boy!
Tough room.
I must say, you've really got me now.
I mean, this is a diabolical plan.
Throw yourself at my feet with a broken arm and no weapons?
- How am I gonna get outta this one?
- You got a nice setup here.
- But you made one mistake.
- What was that?
I'm not actually positive, but statistically speaking people usually make - It seemed kinda weird.
- Weird's a pretty good word for it.
Buffy wouldn'tjust take off.
That's just not in her nature.
Except when she disappeared for several months and changed her name, but there were circumstances then.
There's no circumstances.
Does Buffy have a history of emotional problems?
Cos on my request form I was specific about a stable nonsmoker.
- I don't think this is her handwriting.
- I bet there were circumstances!
We've probably been so wrapped up in our own petty lives that that we totally missed the circumstances.
We're bad friends!
- Well, let's think this through.
- How can you be so calm?
Long, arduous hours of practice.
Now either Buffy took off, or she was robbed, or - It's a prank!
- Xander!
How are my guys?
- I don't know you, do l?
- No.
- This is very intrusive, isn't it?
- Little bit!
- Xander.
- Kathy.
- Do we hug?
- I think we're too manly.
- What's the prank?
- Prank?
Oh, the room.
Some friends of Buffy's played a funnyjoke, and they took her stuff.
Now she wants us to help get it back from her friends who sleep all day and have no tans.
- Oh!
Those friends!
- They're funny guys.
They took the chest.
Well, let's go!
Let's go to our friend.
- It's nice meeting you, Kathy.
- You, too!
- Let's go to Will's, get supplies.
- Is Buffy in danger?
She's in a holding pattern.
We've got some time.
Oh, and this.
This is my favourite item.
You don't wanna touch that.
You know, this arm's not looking so good.
- It might have to come off.
- You wanna know the truth?
I only need one.
This is starting to suck.
When you look back at this, before you to turn to dust, I think you'll find the mistake was touching my stuff.
What about breaking your arm?
- How does that feel?
- Let me answer that with a head butt.
And for the record the arm is hurt.
It's not broken.
Hey, Buff.
Need a hand?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
So, all that other stuff in there?
That's gonna sit in there, right?
- No one owns it in the strictest sense.
- It seems wrong somehow.
- Dibs on the rowing machine.
- Buffy!
- Hi, Giles.
- What's with the arsenal?
I've been awake all night.
I'm supposed to teach you self-reliance, but I can't leave you out there to fight alone.
To hell with what's right.
I'm ready to back you up.
Let's find the evil and fight it together.
Great!
Thanks!
We'll get right on that.
- The evil is this way?
- My room is.
Giles, can you get this box on top?
So, college not so scary after all, huh?
It's turning out to be a lot like high school, which I can handle.
At least I know what to expect.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Isn't college cool?
Ijusthaven'thada lot oftime to think aboutlife at UC Sunnydale.
- Wow.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Have you met your roommate yet?
- No.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Kathy.
I just know that this whole year is gonna be super fun.
I've forgotten my manners in the concussion.
I'm Riley.
Are you taking lntro Psych?
- You've taken it?
- I'm a TA.
I help the professor.
I'm Professor Walsh.
Those who fall under my good graces will come to know me as Maggie.
Those who don't will come to know me by the name my TAs use and think I don't know: the Evil Bitch Monster of Death.
Officially, you no longer have a watcher.
I'll always be here when you need me.
You'll have to take care ofyourself.
So, college not so scary after all, huh?
It's turning out to be a lot like high school, which I can handle.
At least I know what to expect.
Wow, this music is so, - so - I know.
This song is super fun, isn't it?
You bet.
Itjust gets funner and funner every time you play it.
- Going out?
- Yeah.
I'm seriously caffeine deprived.
Figured I'd head down to The Grotto and get ajolt and - do some studying.
- It's late.
Won't you be up all night?
Oh, yeah, but it's cool.
I'm sort of an up kinda night person.
I mentioned that, right?
I guess I didn't realise you'd be coming and going at all hours.
Well, not that I mind.
- I'm just surprised.
- I'll be quiet as a mouse, I promise.
- OK.
- Say, Buffy.
I wanted to show you this little system I implemented.
Oh, goody.
System.
Just log every call you make in here so when the bill comes it won't be a problem.
- Cos I figure "A stitch in time - ..
catches the worm".
You bet.
OK, then.
Also I noticed that some of my milk was missing.
Did you?
- Yeah, actually, I did.
I meant to - No.
It's totally OK.
I was just wondering.
- Yeah, I was making my coffee and - It's fine.
I just wanted to make sure that we didn't have a thief or something.
Like who?
Sid the Wiley Dairy Gnome?
I don't know It's no big deal.
I mean, please, feel free.
OK.
I'm really sorry.
- I have to - Have a good time.
Yeah.
You, too.
With ironing.
So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
Yep.
She made big with the questions.
You thought your days of sneaking out ofyour room were over.
No such luck.
Kathy's nice and all, but she's, sort of, I don't know, like, Mini-Mom of Momdonia.
Wait.
Did you just hear something?
- I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
- That's not it.
- My sneakers are squeaky.
- I'm looking for something lurky, Will.
- Sorry, no.
- Darn, I could use a little play tonight.
Listening to the best ofVH1 all day sorta put me on edge.
- Kathy's still spinning the divas?
- Cos it's the funnest.
It's no big.
College is a time of change, right?
Before too long, she'll be trip-hopping all over the place.
Yeah.
This whole dorm thing is just an adjustment we need to make.
You know?
I mean, my roomie is kind of "challenging", too.
And what are we, if not women up to a challenge?
Exactly.
I mean, did we not put the "grr" in "girl"?
- Well, here's where I get off.
- Say hey to Oz for me.
- Happy hunting.
- Wish me monsters.
Will?
All right, why don't you quit hiding and come out and face me like a thing?
Hey, I caught you.
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's super.
I just decided a decaf latte sounded like heaven after all.
So you're coming along.
Why not?
This way, you don't have to walk these spooky paths alone.
Great.
That's just great.
This is neat, isn't it?
The fresh air, the trees.
The smell of What the blizzard was that all about?
He tried to take my backpack.
God, what were you thinking, taking him on like that?
I don't know.
I guess I panicked.
I mean, it's just you could've gotten hurt or something.
God, and look at my sweater, it's ruined.
Yeah, sorry about that.
Here, we'll go get you cleaned up.
Boring.
Boring.
Bill.
Bill.
Hello.
- You run?
- And jump.
And bend.
- And occasionally frolic.
- OK.
And what's with the Motorbike and Scooter magazine?
Congratulations, you've found me out.
I'm a mod jogger.
Are you having a midlife thing?
I still go "ish" from the last time you tried to recapture your youth.
- Buffy.
- Sorry.
Demon.
Last night.
Made with the pummelling, but he got away.
- What sort of demon?
- He had a cloak on and glowing green eyes.
And his skin had a, like, super-bad fake rub-on tan.
- Translate?
- Orangey.
Thank you.
Anything else?
My roommate Kathy was there, but she didn't see anything.
You took your roommate patrolling with you?
I invited the whole dorm, but she was the only one that could make it.
I told her I was going for coffee and she decided to tag along.
We should discourage her from that habit.
From what you describe, I'm not familiar with the creature, but I'll give you a ring when I've found something.
- You know, it's nice out here.
- Yes, I take my tea out here sometimes.
- What are you doing today?
- It's a big day for me, actually.
A friend acquired an original Gutenberg demonography.
And you've never once asked me what my day's plans were, which leads me to inquire whether you're feeling yourself.
That's not true.
I ask about you all the time.
OK, maybe the words don't actually make it out of my mouth, but I think about it.
And it's appreciated.
Doesn't explain why you're hanging around instead of rushing off as usual.
It's no big.
I just figured I'd hang here, you know, until my roommate goes to class.
I see.
I know, it's probablyjust me having a bitch attack.
But it's not me.
Living with somebody is never easy.
Especially for an only child.
Giles, listen.
When sharpening her pencils, she measures them with a ruler so they're all the same size.
Which is fussy, I agree, but everybody has their idiosyncrasies.
You'd do well to learn to tolerate them.
Or I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats?
- Something like that.
- OK.
You know what?
You're right.
Take a mental pic.
This is the new Buffy.
Kinder, gentler, roommate extraordinaire.
Ex-boyfriend or loan shark?
- Excuse me?
- The person you're hiding from.
Both.
Ugly break-up.
- I'm sorry, I just cut you - No, stay, stay.
I'll watch your back.
- Freshman, huh?
- Is it that obvious?
There are signs.
People who've been around know how to use their dining-hall card.
It's not for food?
Work it right and you get three meals' worth, which equals fewer punch cards used.
More cash from dad that you keep for yourself.
Right.
See, the goal is to polish off as much as humanly possible in one sitting.
Enough to get you through the day, while chipmunking items for future consumption.
Got it.
Excess dry goods fit nicely in a backpack or your pocket.
The wetter items - macaronis, your turkey loaf - then you're into Ziplocs.
- It's not for beginners.
- I'll just take it slow.
- So - So, those are my - Are you?
- Oh, no, I have someone waiting.
Otherwise, I'd Parker Abrams.
I'm at Kresky Hall.
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.
OK.
Well, I'll see you around, Buffy Summers of Stevenson.
See ya, Parker Abrams.
Hey.
Say hi to Non-College Guy.
Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys usually populate the non-campus?
Usually.
I just thought I'd come around and check on my girls.
- And eat off my plate.
- What's the deal?
Parents not feeding you?
- Sure they do.
For a price.
- So, spill.
What was that all about, with the cutie patootie?
I don't know.
Nothing serious, I think.
Just random adorableness.
A technique I know well.
Hit the girl with your best shot, then hasta.
- Gotta respect the drive-by.
- Low rejection, fond memories.
It looked like more than that to me.
He got all googly-eyed.
That's because he got hit by the Buffinator.
Now he's powerless.
- You think?
- No question, he'll be back.
So what else is up with the Buff?
- Any vamp action?
- No.
I did getjumped by a demon of non-specific origin last night.
Yeah?
Something apocalypsey?
Do we need to assemble the Scooby gang?
No, but thank you for asking.
I just got way too excited, didn't l?
You need to get out of the basement a little more.
Hi, everybody.
Squeeze in.
You all know my roomie, Kathy.
- Hi.
- Hey, Kathy.
Is that my sweater?
I didn't think you'd mind.
You got mine all muddy.
- I was saving you from a - Bear.
mugger.
It's not a problem, is it?
I figure we're like sisters now, living together and everything.
No, it's it's fine.
I just wished you'd asked.
- So, where're you from, Kathy?
- Nebraska, originally.
Ah, yes.
Big-sky country.
Can you believe her?
First she acts like she has sit privileges at my lunch table Can you believe her?
First she acts like she has sit privileges at my lunch table just because a computer decided to make us cellmates.
I'm sure it's not easyforher.
She's notlike you - she doesn'tknowanybodyhere.
Fine.
But what about my sweater?
You can't believe what I put up with.
Yeah, I guess it's hard.
- The sweater thing was an accident.
- I don'tknow.
- Sorry.
- I don't thinkl can take another day ofthis.
She's back from the bathroom.
Call you back.
Don't forget to log those calls.
Who left their gum here?
- Gum gnome?
- It wasn't me.
It had to be somebody, Buffy.
I don't know.
Do you always make that noise when you sleep?
So, after the scorpion, the demon opened my mouth and sucked a weird light out of me.
And the worst part?
I wake up and there's Kathy, staring at me like I'm a freak.
Actually, the worst part, I'd have to go with the demon pouring blood down your throat.
Me, too.
I would vote for that, too.
But that's just a dream, and this Kathy thing is real.
All she cared about was her precious sleep being disturbed.
Perhaps it would be more productive to examine your dreams.
Determine their meaning.
You can read dreams?
Neat.
Giles, Kathy.
Kathy, Giles.
He's our grown-up friend.
Not in a creepy way.
- Nice to meet you, Kathy.
- Ditto.
Maybe you can read the dream I had last night?
There was this monster and he sat on me and did all this stuffto me.
Stuff like scorpions?
And Bloody Mary minus the Mary?
- How'd you know?
- Well, I'm a good guesser.
Me, too.
And I'm guessing that you need to be on your way to class.
Right, Kath?
Somebody woke up on the wrong side ofthe bed.
And guess what?
You were next to it.
You know, I need to dash.
My whole schedule is off because someone kept me up all night.
Well, it's been fun.
Toodles.
Toodles.
- You know what this means?
- Yes.
Not only does she take my sweater, but now she has to horn in on my dreams.
She is the most ever mooch.
I haven't even gotten to the floss.
Buffy, focus.
Please?
lf Kathy and you are having the same nightmares, chances are something happened when you both met the demon.
So we need to figure out ifthis ritual they're dreaming about has some use or meaning.
Cool.
You guys can do the brain thing.
- I'm gonna go to class.
- Which could also be the brain thing.
Not when you're minoring in Napping 101.
OK, so that was the evil twin, right?
Cos she was bordering on Cordelia-esque.
She's definitely pushing the stress meter on this Kathy thing.
I concur that she's not herself.
But, you know, learning to live with someone can be a challenge.
And she hasn't been sleeping.
Right, then.
Nothing to get too concerned about.
Still, let me know if she Hits the red zone?
Yes.
Lots of popular artists don't get their dues.
Madonna.
Whitney.
- That's so totally true.
- Parker?
Hey.
I just stopped by to say that.
And bring you You know, to maximise your dining-hall exports.
- They're heavy-duty.
- "Plus freezer guard".
That's so Parker was just gonna leave his number and go, but we started talking.
He's such a blast, and the time just flew.
Time?
Really?
How much time?
I'm not sure.
We sort of got caught up talking Red Wings.
It turns out Kathy's a closet hockey fan.
I think it's the violence.
- Quit it.
I told you that was just between us.
- It could be the sweaty men.
Stop.
Look, ifyou two are gonna rassle, can you take it outside?
I have a lot ofwork to do.
Sorry, I didn't realise.
Parker, wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to No, it's totally cool.
I should go anyway.
Well, it was great ofyou to stop by.
Maybe we could do it another time?
Another time, for sure.
- Bye, Kathy.
- Bye.
See ya.
It wouldn't have killed you to be nice, you know.
Looked like you were being nice enough for the both of us.
I wasn't moving in on your territory, ifthat's what you mean.
Right.
Just like you didn't destroy my sweater.
- I'm cold.
- Well, I'm hot.
Deal with it.
- D'you know what your problem is, Buffy?
- You?
Hardly.
Your problem is you're spoiled.
The world revolved around you where you used to live, but it's share time now.
Share time, huh?
Fine.
I'll show you share time.
- You're worried about her.
- Yeah, both ofthem.
What kind of demon runs around putting ooky blood dreams into people's heads?
Like some kind of nightmare fairy.
It's not right.
- Well, I'm against it.
- And Buffy's completely being not herself.
If it wasn't for this English paper, I'd be there right now.
You know, listening.
Doing the girly best friend thing.
- Well, I can do that.
- You can?
I'm not saying we'll braid each other's hair, but I can hang with her.
- Watch for signs she's going over the edge.
- You're the best.
She's probably patrolling by now.
Check around the science centre.
Ifyou need me, I'll be at the library.
..
so then Kathy's like "It's share time".
And I'm like "Oh, yeah?
Share this".
So either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine for her.
I didn't do either, actually.
But she deserved it, don't you think?
- Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.
- Kathy does.
She deserves to be locked in an invisible box and blown away by an imaginary wind and - Forced to wear a binding unitard?
- The itchy kind.
It's perfect.
- I'm just here to help.
- Which I appreciate.
But you've never come on routine patrol with me before, Oz.
So what's the deal?
Seemed more interesting than homework.
As long as it's an elective.
I can handle myself alone, you know.
- Not in question.
- Good.
So, I go to the refrigerator, right?
And the Label Queen has put Just a thought - do you think all this ranting is scaring away potential demons?
You're right.
She's even affecting my work now.
She's the Titanic.
She's a crawling black cancer.
She's other really bad things.
On the plus side, you killed the bench, which was looking shifty.
This isn't funny, Oz.
Something has to be done.
Agreed.
I'm going to bed.
Oh, jeez.
I do what I can, but Buffy's difficult.
She's secretive, for one thing.
She comes in at all hours ofthe night.
She leaves her gum all over the place.
It sounds like things are rough, but don't you wanna be talking to Buffy about this?
I would, but she's so touchy about all kinds ofweird stuff.
I mean, sometimes I get the feeling that she is not quite normal.
You know?
Well, normal is relative, right?
Later, OK?
- Why were you talking to her?
- Buffy, come on.
We were just saying hi.
Yeah, that's what she wants you to think.
Buffy, this has to stop.
I mean, I get it.
I have a sucky roomie, too.
But you just have to deal.
You're right.
I've been thinking a lot about this and - it's clear to me now.
- Good.
That's better.
Kathy's evil.
I'm an evil fighter.
It's simple.
I'm gonna have to kill her.
You have to kill her?
Don't you think you could just switch rooms or something?
Well, I would, but it's notjust me in danger from Kathy.
Look.
- Toenails?
- Evil toenails.
I took them when she was in the bathroom.
She thought I was asleep.
Cos in the middle ofthe night they could have attacked you and left little marks all over your body.
Don't be ridiculous.
I measured them before I fell asleep and again this morning, and they grew.
After they were cut.
That's a demon thing.
- She has to be eliminated.
- Of course.
It makes sense now.
But you'd better show those bad puppies to Giles before you do anything, just to be sure.
Absolutely.
I wouldn't wanna do anything crazy.
You hurry on to Giles.
I'll hang here and keep an eye on Kathy.
Great.
Good.
Thanks, Will.
Giles.
I just talked to Buffy and, yeah, I think she's feeling a little insane.
No, not bitchy crazy.
More like homicidal-maniac crazy?
So I told her to come see you, OK?
Giles?
Anybody home?
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
This is this is ridiculous.
- This hurts me more than it hurts you.
- Not yet, but it will.
Don't say that.
Please don't say that.
We're doing this to stop you from making a terrible mistake.
Clearly, something is amiss.
Yeah, something's amiss, a Miss Kathy Newman.
Giles.
Giles, look in my bag.
Look in the bottom pocket of my bag.
She has parts that grow after they're detached.
She irons herjeans.
She's evil.
She has to be destroyed.
I fear the demon that Buffy met in the woods has somehow possessed her.
- Lite FM.
Nothing but love songs.
- You think?
You stay and watch her.
I know a spell that will reveal the demon so that we can fight it, but I need to get some supplies from the magic shop.
Buffy, l See you around.
- Can I come in?
- Sure.
- Where's Buffy?
- I don't know exactly.
But I've been thinking.
You and Buffy should give each other some apart time.
In fact, you might wanna be apart before she gets back.
What do you mean?
I should leave the room?
- Why should I go?
- It's not fair, I know.
You bet it's not fair, having to live with someone who's obviously troubled.
Someone who so clearly needs to be in a home, not in a dorm.
I don't know about that.
Buffy's going through something, yes, but I wouldn't put it past her to drop out, or take off.
Do something horrible to herself.
- Herself?
- Or worse.
She's capable of it, you know.
You can see it in those shifty little eyes of hers.
One ofthese days she might push somebody too far.
Hello?
It's Oz.
Hi.
You did?
She's at Giles'.
OK.
You know, during that really short phone call I realised you are so right.
I mean, it's not fair to make you leave your own room.
So, you're good.
You just stay, right there.
OK?
I can't believe this.
After all we've been through, and you won't believe me when I tell you that Kathy is bad.
- We want to, Buff.
It's just - Don't engage.
I don't know if I tightened those ropes enough.
Well, then we'd better go over there and check 'em.
Oh, dear God.
Avoid the legs.
Avoid the legs.
Nope, not tight enough.
Kathy.
Buffy.
I think we need to talk, don't you?
Absolutely.
Let's talk.
Look what I did.
Look what I did.
I knew it.
- Quit it.
- I knew it.
I knew you were a demon.
Why don't you just stuff it and let me finish my ritual?
- Ritual?
- "The ritual of Mok'tagar, trans-dimensional demons: forced ingestion of animal blood while the victim slumbers".
- Buffy's nightmares - ..
were real.
I'm sorry, OK?
I left my dimension to go to college and they sent these guys after me.
"While they can assume many forms and guises, including human, they can always be recognised by others oftheir kind due to the lack of a soul".
- So I'm borrowing yours.
- Without even asking.
Tonight, when they come looking for me, they'll take the one without a soul.
- I won't have to watch you floss.
- And I won't have to live with a slob.
It's share time, Buffy.
Fine.
Then let's start with my sweater.
Why couldn't Giles have shackles like any self-respecting bachelor?
Guys, I just saw Kathy and she's acting - Oh, my God.
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Buffy's got a pretty good lead on us.
- I'll call Kathy, tell her to get out ofthere.
All you had to do was write down your calls.
- No answer.
- Toenails.
Buffy's right.
Kathy's toenails not only grow after they're cut, they actually regenerate ifthey're destroyed.
- And that's a demon thing?
- Unequivocally, yes.
So Where is Buffy?
Oh, dear, we have even less time than I feared.
I've looked up all known regenerating demons.
Only one species practises the ritual that Buffy's been seeing in her sleep.
It's used to steal the soul from a human body.
Wait.
Has Buffy been doing a Linda Blair on us because Kathy's been sucking her soul?
- I believe so, yes.
Excuse me, please.
- So Buffy was right all along.
- Later on, big remorse.
- Now, I've found a spell that should reverse the soul transfer procedure immediately.
Willow and I will perform it.
Leaving Xander and me to help Buffy in the flesh.
"Hear me, elders ofthe upper reaches".
"Elders ofthe lower reaches.
Elders ofthe dry land.
Elders ofthe river flats".
Do you mind?
People are trying to study.
"Ancients, I beseech you.
The soul, abstracted, let it revert to its true seat".
The window's open.
Happy?
Open up.
Let me finish.
"Let it be finished".
"Let the unnatural vessel be emptied.
Let the essence be returned to its original host".
How did you do?
- How's that?
- A little to the left.
There.
Perfect.
I'm so glad you're here, Will.
I can already feel all that bad Kathy karma draining away.
About that.
The Kathy thing?
- I'm sorry I doubted you.
- You're completely forgiven.
I mean, you had reason to doubt.
Except for the soul-sucking thing, I bet Kathy was pretty regular - as far as roomies go.
- That's a pretty big "except".
- I guess.
I'm just glad that it was Kathy's demony ways making me No-Fun Buffy.
I've always thought I was pretty easy-going.
It's not like I have the big issues.
I don't burn incense or Are you gonna finish this?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
When I see your face My eyes just dilate But I can't erase That I wanna violate - Hey, look.
Parker's here.
- Yeah.
You're not looking?
He looks really cute in green.
Teal.
He's reflected in the mirror.
When you spend all week with a boy, you are allowed to look at him directly.
Not all week.
We hung out, moderately incessantly.
But we're not here together tonight.
I don't wanna crowd him.
Hey.
You guys ready to load up and go?
Almost.
Buffy's lookin' at Parker.
Who, it turns out, has a reflection, so big plus there.
- Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
- No, I'm not!
- No, you're not.
- Oh, I so am.
No, they're not wrong feelings, cos there's no wrong.
You're free, you're both grown-ups.
You are free, right?
Hi.
I just wanted to let you know I'm headin' out.
And it's not real safe around here, so ifyou, you know, walk back to your dorm How silly of me not to have planned ahead.
- Bye.
- See you, guys.
That was, like, the best set ever.
We'll do great in LA.
We'll have 'em glued to their seats.
Uh, Devon?
Aren't they supposed to dance?
Well, we can glue 'em to the dance floor.
I don't mean with real glue.
- You got that, right?
- I got that.
Willow?
- Harmony!
Hi.
I haven't seen you since - Since graduation.
- Big snake, huh?
- Yeah.
- So, how was your summer vacation?
- Oh, I was gonna go to France.
- But I didn't.
I was dying to see the stores.
- Oh, and museums.
- Museums?
- Yeah.
I heard they had 'em.
You know, a rumour you pick up on the streets.
Right.
You're always so funny, Willow.
You haven't changed a bit.
- No, you neither.
- Oh, maybe a little.
Back off, Harmony!
OK.
Fine.
Hide behind your boyfriend.
But guess what.
I have a boyfriend too.
And he's gonna be mad that you were mean to me.
- Hobbies?
- Yeah.
Hobbies.
Interests.
I feel like there's so much I still don't know about you.
What do you like to do?
Well, mostly I hang out and do stuff.
Yeah, I was into that for a while.
- What's that?
- What's what?
- You have a scar.
- Right.
Angry puppy.
So, do I get to see any ofyour scars?
- Oh, mine are all psychological.
- Oh, please.
Those are the best kind.
Well, my father died last year.
Oh.
God.
Parker, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bring up that stuff.
- Bad, bad Buffy.
- No, no, I'm OK to talk about it now.
And I'm not doing the deep, get-sympathy routine.
I mean, don't you just hate guys who are all "I'm dark and brooding, so give me love"?
I don't think I've ever met that type.
I just wanted to say that what made it so sad was that there was a lot of stuff he didn't get to finish.
It made me think about you know, living for now.
I think about that sometimes.
Yeah, I sort of drowned a couple ofyears ago.
But I came back.
Obviously.
But I don't put stuff off any more.
Like you were saying.
That's great.
I mean, everybody says they get it: "Oh, man, me too.
Live for today".
But they really want an excuse to goof off and not study for finals.
Also a valid life choice.
It's cool to find someone else who understands.
So, Parker Abrams, when you go to sleep tonight, what are you gonna regret not doing today?
I'm going to regret being too nervous to ask you to go to the party at Wolf House tomorrow night.
- Do you wanna go to the party - Yes.
I'm not enjoying this.
Shelve them correctly and we can finish.
- I don't get your crazy system.
- My system?
It's called the alphabet.
Huh.
Would you look at that?
- You should lock your door.
- Believe me, I am kicking myself.
Anya?
Last time I saw you, fleeing in terror.
How'd that work out for ya?
I need to talk to Xander.
Go away.
Xander, come with me.
- Your mother said you were working here.
- Yeah.
I need some money.
- So where is our relationship going?
- Our what?
Our who?
Relationship.
What kind do we have, and what is it progressing toward?
I We have a relationship?
We went to the prom.
Yes.
On our one-and-only date.
Second date called on account of snake, remember?
And there's the "you used to be a man-killing demon" thing, which, to be fair, is as much my issue as it is yours.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Sometimes, in my dreams, you're all naked.
Really?
lf I'm in the checkout line at the Wal-Mart, I've had that same one.
So, I can assume a standing Friday-night date and recognise prom night as our anniversary?
Anya, slow down.
In fact, come to a screeching halt.
See, these things kind of have to develop on their own.
- All right.
How?
- I don't know.
Itjust happens.
This is it.
My door.
Wood.
Maybe some kind ofwood veneer.
It's nice.
Hey!
Hi.
Hi.
Remember Harmony?
She's back from her summer vacation.
And she's a little different.
- Different?
- Paler.
- Is your neck OK?
- Neck.
Paler.
Puppy.
The angry puppy!
Yeah.
We came to warn you about the angry puppy.
- I should take care ofthis now.
- I'll pick you up tomorrow night for the party.
I can't wait.
Band-Aid.
Now.
Thank you.
Harmony's a vampire?
She must be dying without a reflection.
She just made me so mad.
"My boyfriend's gonna beat you up".
- "My boyfriend"?
- Well, ifyou believe her.
She always lied about stuff like that.
"He goes to another school.
You wouldn't know him".
Devon dated her for a while, but she was too flaky for him, which Stop and marvel at the concept.
A guy dating Harmony dead.
Must be, like, the most tolerant guy in the world.
Hi, baby.
I'm back.
It's definitely the crypt?
I'm not keen on tunnelling into someone's septic tank.
It's the crypt.
The radar soundings are clear.
The walls are thinnest here at the bottom.
We have to tunnel from underneath.
More work, but I'm sure You'd better be more than sure, mate.
Cos I'd hate to have to hurt you.
I swear.
I swear.
How's my little blondie bear?
Harm, does this look like a good time to talk?
Are you gonna kill Willow today?
Cos I want you to say: "This is for messing with my sweet girl".
And then, you know Nobody knows I'm here.
Killing the Slayer's best friend would tend to announce I'm back.
We're too bloody close.
You almost killed her last year.
Why the big deal?
Sod off!
Go eat something.
I've got work to do.
- This one tastes funny.
Take me out to eat.
- He's perfectly fresh.
I had a math class with him last year.
I didn't like him then, either.
- Harm!
- I wanna go to a party!
Ooh.
Right here, baby?
ln front of Brian?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Maybe I would.
After a party.
Tonight.
I'll take you somewhere nice.
Standin' in the pouring rain Cos you couldn't even be there to pick me up You're taking me for granted again You're running out oftime and you're out of luck Just a moment ofweakness This is some party, huh?
Last days of Rome.
Better.
No old Romans.
- You wanna dance?
- No.
Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
Spike.
- And Harmony.
- Buffy.
Hi.
What a cute outfit - Iast year.
Well, this is interesting.
It's sort of a double date.
Looks like your friend started the party a little early, huh?
Say, let's have a look at the new boy.
Hi.
I'm Parker.
I like him.
He's got What's the word?
Vulnerability.
And you with Harmony.
What, did you lose a bet?
Hey!
Actually, how we met, it's a funny story really.
Stay here.
What's the matter, Spike?
Dru dump you again?
Maybe I dumped her.
She left him for a fungus demon.
That's all he talks about.
Harm!
We are going.
It isn't time yet.
Yeah.
But as soon as we have the Gem ofAmara, you're gonna be sorr What?
Ow!
Come in.
Anya.
Hi again.
Your mother sent me around.
She also said to add fabric softener when the timer goes off.
- Can we talk some more?
- Yeah, I suppose.
Would you care for somethin'?
I have cran-apple.
All right.
You know, it is customary to call before you show up.
Not that Yeah, Spike with Harmony.
Ifyou can believe it.
I couldn'tfigure out whyhe ran away, butHarmonysaidsomething.
Why they were here.
They were looking for the Gem of something.
Um, Amara?
The Gem ofAmara?
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
What's up?
- Oh, it's just it's not real.
It's like the vampire equivalent ofthe Holy Grail.
A source of some enormous power, always conveniently vague.
Here it is.
Yes.
"There was a great deal of vampiric interest in locating the Gem during" Oh, the 10th century.
"Questing vampires combed the earth, but no one found it".
"It was concluded that it never existed".
Well, Spike seems to think it exists.
And he's lookin' in Sunnydale.
Yes, well, I'llresearch itas bestl can.
You've done all you can for tonight.
Go to bed.
Uh-huh.
Sleepy.
Yawn.
Bye.
- Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
- No.
Oh.
- Can I make him a vampire?
- No.
Wait.
On second thought, yeah.
Go do that.
Take your time.
Do Melanie and the kids as well.
Hey, I don't have a pulse.
Cool!
Can we eat a doctor, so I can get a stethoscope and hear my heart not beating?
Harm, what does it take to get you to shut the hell up?
And if my heart's not beating, then what are all these veins for?
I'm simply covered in these blue veins.
See?
We've got an extra set of chains.
Eeuw!
Just because Dorkus went in for that - Dru-silla.
- Whatever.
- Say her name.
- Dorkus.
- Bite your tongue.
- Do it for me.
At which point the matter is concluded, with both parties satisfied and able to move on with their separate lives.
To sum up, I think it's a workable plan.
So, the crux ofthis plan is?
Sexual intercourse.
I've said it, like, a dozen times.
Uh-huh.
Just working through a little hysterical deafness here.
I think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind.
Putting you behind me.
Behind me figuratively.
I'm thinking face to face for the event itself.
Ah.
Right.
It's just we hardly know each other.
I mean, I like you.
And you have a certain directness that I admire.
But sexual inter What you're talking about, well And I'm actually turning into a woman as I say this But it's about expressing something.
And accepting consequences.
Oh, I have condoms.
Some are black.
That's That's very considerate.
I like you.
You're funny, and you're nicely shaped.
And, frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not interlock.
Please remove your clothing now.
And the amazing thing?
Still more romantic than Faith.
Fabric softener.
Parker.
I was afraid I wasn't gonna be able to find you.
- I was getting a little worried.
- I'm so sorry.
It's just the English guy is an old friend.
And he's not supposed to drink.
And I saw him here, you know, in the land ofthe beer Buffy, it's OK.
You did a good thing for your friend.
Did you and he used to, like, go out?
No.
No, we really, really didn't.
Good.
Now, we have time to make up for.
Think I could get a dance with the prettiest girl at the party?
And what do I do?
Just stand here and watch?
It was a Monday when My lover told me "Never pay the Reaper with Love only" What could I say to you Except "I love you" And "I'd give my life for yours"?
I know we are We are the lucky ones I know we are We are the lucky ones I know we are We are the lucky ones, dear Well, I declared pre-med, but I hated it.
So I switched to history.
History?
Fascinating dates and compelling places.
But there's something amazing about these huge events, that when you dig down into them, they're all about people.
Just regular people just trying to make choices.
When you look back, it seems like they were swept up in events they couldn't control.
But I don't believe that.
You always have a choice with everything you do.
Is this OK?
Because I could stop ifyou wanted.
It's your choice.
What are you doing?
Making a choice.
lknow, lknow, lknow, lknow lknow, lknow lknow, lknow It's time to letyou know Time to letyou know Time to letyou know Time to sithere andsay Hey.
This is Buffyand Willow.
We're notin rightnow, so please leave a message.
Buffy, are you there?
Call me.
I need to talk to you right away.
We are the lucky ones lknow we are We are the lucky ones, dear Dear We are the lucky ones, dear Dear We are the lucky ones, dear Parker?
OK.
Just a shirt Pants.
Everybody needs pants.
- Hey, you're up.
- You're here.
- I live here.
- Oh, I just I didn't know where you were.
It seemed like you were gonna be out for a while, so I ran for coffee.
It's better than what I've got around here - warm soda and breath mints.
Breath mints.
Wouldn't be turning 'em down right now.
So, do you have plans today, or?
Actually, my mom's coming to visit.
Oh.
Well, I'll just clear out, then.
But maybe we could, you know, talk or something later?
- Absolutely.
I'll give you a call.
- Great.
- Oh, one more thing before I go.
- A kiss?
Well, I was going to go with pants, but a kiss is good too.
So, I'm over you now.
OK.
OK?
Yeah?
Harm, what are you doing?
I'm writing "Spike loves Harmony" on your back.
- Why?
- I don't know.
It's fun.
I'm bored.
You can write on me.
Got to get back to work.
You love that tunnel more than me.
I love syphilis more than you.
- Good morning.
- Giles!
- I didn't know you were here.
- Oh, really?
I was studying.
At the library.
All Saturday night.
You know what?
I'm an adult and it's none ofyour business.
And I'm sincerely relieved to hear it.
Now, can we discuss the impending disaster?
- Giles found something.
- A text.
It refers to the Gem ofAmara as residing in the "Valley ofthe Sun".
- Demon fancy talk for Sunnydale.
- It seems Spike may know what it's about.
The Gem may exist after all, in Sunnydale, in a sealed underground crypt.
Why don't you guys try and locate the crypt?
I'll see if I can find Spike before he gets there.
- I'll get started.
- I'll tell Xander and Oz to meet at your place.
Right.
It happened, right?
Did it happen?
With Parker?
- Yeah, it happened.
- Well, and?
Details!
I mean, not details.
I don't need a diagram.
But, you know, like, maybe a blurry watercolour.
It was nice.
It was really nice.
He's gonna call.
I love this part.
Don't you love this part?
When it's all new and everything's a discovery?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
- It's here!
- I knew it was here.
We're close now.
No one leaves the lair till we're in.
I don't want the Slayer tracking us to the tunnel.
That means you, Harm.
You're an indoor kitty now.
But, Spike, you said you'd take me places.
You said we'd go to France, and now I can't even leave the lair?
Listen to me, you stupid bint.
This Gem is everything.
I came back to Sunnydale for it.
A place which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my ass.
Now, when I have the Gem, they all die, don't worry.
But until then, stay inside.
And by the way, I would be insanely happy iffrom this point on I heard bugger all about sodding France!
I don't know why I let you be so mean to me.
Love hurts, baby.
Water turns to sand And turns to sound And turns to sound Followme, I'm goin' Underground This orbitis An interlude Temporary, planetaryfood You've got one newmessage, at 9.05pm.
Hi, it's me.
I'm at Giles'.
DidParker callyet?
Lendme yourfire So I can burn Save allmyashes Formyreturn Not with a scream But with a sigh It's real.
Ooh.
Pretty.
Can I take stuff?
Take whatever you want.
I don't care.
Eeuw!
Like you're too good to work a clasp.
So?
ls it doing it?
Do you feel it?
I mean, you don't look any different, ifyou wondered.
I thought maybe you'd look taller, or glow, or something.
You should put some butter on that.
But, hey, maybe it's worth money anyway.
And then we could go to France and stay in a chateau, and you could take me shopping I can't believe you just did that!
Hold on.
What are you doing, you big freak?
- That's my Gem.
- Don't Fine!
Fine!
lfthat's all that matters to you, then just take it.
Take it.
Take it and get out!
That's a good idea.
I think I'll go play outside.
OK, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm movin' in.
There are more important things than records right now.
More important than this one?
- I suppose an argument could be made for - Whoa!
Giles has a TV!
Everybody, Giles has a TV.
He's shallow, like us.
- I gotta admit, a little disappointed.
- Maybe it doesn't work.
It's, like, art.
Andin breaking localnews, area residents face traffic disruptions Public television.
Look, come on, we have vital work to do.
Watching television won't help us right now.
..
near the UC Sunnydale campus.
Officials attributed the unusual occurrence to weakening ofthe topsoilsupportnearby.
City work crews deny thatany tunnelling has been done in the area.
Tunnelling.
Spike.
Come on.
Xander, find Buffy and meet us there.
I mean, it hit me hard, you know?
My dad.
Since then I just don't put stuff off any more.
It's about living for now.
- Parker?
- Buffy.
Buffy Summers, this is Katie Loomis.
What's going on?
Hey, Katie, you're gonna be late for class.
I'll catch up later, OK?
- She's a friend ofyours?
- Yeah.
You'd like her a bunch.
So, what's up?
Well, you didn't call.
I mean, I'd understand, you know, ifyou were busy, or sick, or something.
It's only been a couple of days.
You need to talk to me about something?
- Is everything OK?
- Sure it is.
- It is?
- Sure.
So, maybe do you wanna do something?
- We could do that.
Absolutely.
- Great.
How about tonight?
Well, the thing is I think I'm supposed to get together with some people later.
Parker, did l - Did I do something wrong?
- Something wrong?
No, of course not.
It was fun.
Didn't you have fun?
Watch out how you answer that.
My ego is fragile.
You had fun.
- Is that all it was?
- Well, what else was it supposed to be?
It seemed Iike you liked me.
I do.
But I'm starting to feel like you thought that meant What?
Some kind of commitment?
I mean, is that really what you want right now?
I just thought Look, I'm sorry ifyou misunderstood something.
I thought things were pretty clear.
I didn't mean to mis I'm sorry.
Look, I really have to go now.
Parker, wait.
- I did this all wrong.
- No, it's cool.
We'll hook up later.
Well, that was pathetic.
Isn't it a fantastic day?
Birds singin', squirrels making lots of rotten little squirrels, sun beamin' down in a nice, non-fatal way.
It's very exciting.
Can't wait to see if I freckle.
Oh, do it again.
It tickles.
You know, in a good way.
- The Gem.
- Oh, yeah.
The Gem ofAmara.
Official sponsor of my killing you.
Harmony?
Being a vampire sucks.
Buffy!
Xander.
I was looking for you.
You weren't in your musty basement.
- Have you seen Buffy?
- No.
About what happened.
Well, when I said I was over you, l Anya, I don't have time.
Harmony, where's Spike?
Does he have the Gem?
He staked me, and then he took it.
He tried to take it right off my finger.
Like I wouldn't have just given it to him.
I would've given him anything he wanted.
He was my platinum baby, and I loved him.
Where did Spike go?
Getting tired, Slayer?
Xander, get out of here!
So, you let Parker take a poke, eh?
Didn't seem like you knew each other that well.
What exactly did it take to pry apart the Slayer's dimpled knees?
You're a pig, Spike.
Did he play the sensitive lad and get youto seduce him?
That's a good trick ifthe girl's thick enough to buy it.
I wonder what you did wrong.
Too strong?
Did you bruise the boy?
Whatever.
Guess you're not worth a second go.
Come to think of it, someone told me as much.
Who was that?
Oh, yeah.
Angel.
- Take it off me this way, we both burn.
- Really?
Let's see.
Ow!
God!
I like it.
- It's small.
- Really worth getting my ribs bashed in.
It's obviously very dangerous.
Destroying it would We don't destroy it.
But, Buffy, any vampire that gets his hands on this is going to be essentially unkillable.
Oh.
- I have that gig in LA.
I could swing by.
- Thanks, Oz.
What's goin' on?
What's in LA?
She's giving the ring to Angel.
Don't make a fuss.
Buffy, are you sure?
He should have it.
So what I'm wondering is, does this always happen?
Sleep with a guy and he goes all evil?
God, I'm just a fool.
Well, maybe you made a mistake.
But that's OK.
Next time What?
Parker said it's OK to make mistakes.
It was sweet.
No, it wasn't.
He was saying that so you would take a chance and sleep with him.
He's a poophead.
You're right.
He's manipulative, and shallow And why doesn't he want me?
Am I repulsive?
Ifthere was something repulsive about me, you'd tell me, right?
I'm your friend.
I would call you "repulsive" in a second.
Maybe Parker and I could still work it out.
Do you think we could still work it out?
I think you're missing something about the whole poophead principle.
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna go take a walk.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Urgh!
Argh!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Parker Abrams.
I'm at Kresky Hall.
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - What are you doing?
- Making a choice.
- Parker, did I do something wrong?
- Didn't you have fun?
- Is that all it was?
- What else was it supposed to be?
He's manipulative andshallow.
And why doesn'the wantme?
I think you're missing something about the whole poop-head principle.
Anya.
Hi again.
So, college notso scaryafterall?
It's turning out to be a lotlike high school, which I can handle.
I don't know.
I was going for ferocious-scary, but it's coming out more dryly sardonic.
It does appear to be mocking you with its eyeholes.
Yet its nosehole seems sad and full of self-loathing.
What do you think, Buff?
I was just thinking about the life of a pumpkin.
Grow up in the sun, happily entwined with others, and then someone comes along, cuts you open and rips your guts out.
OK.
And on that happy note, got a treat for tomorrow night's second annual Halloween screening.
People, prepare to have your spines tingled and your gooses bumped by the terrifying Fantasia.
Fantasia?
Maybe it's the horrific things we've seen, but hippos wearing tutus don't unnerve me the way they used to.
Phantasm.
It was supposed to be Phantasm.
Stupid video store.
I thought we were doing the Alpha-Delt thing.
- What thing?
- The scary house?
- Sounds kinda lame.
- But it borders on fun.
You go through the scary-house maze to get to the party, which is worth getting to.
- Those guys go all out.
- As witnessed last Friday.
There's a party?
We didn't tell you?
No, that's cool.
You guys got your little college thing.
I'm fine.
I mean, I got better things to do than tag along to some fraternity.
- You can come.
- OK.
Only because I lied about having better things to do.
Blast will be had by all.
- I'm gonna get going.
- Now?
The night's still OK, it's a little mature, but still I'm sleepy.
You guys have fun.
- You want me to come with?
- No, I'm fine.
Sad Buffy.
She didn't even touch her pumpkin.
It's a freak with no face.
She's suffering post-Parker depression.
Bailing on the Buff.
Does anyone else wanna smack that guy?
Jeez, that hurt.
What the hell's wrong with you, lady?
That's what I'd like to know.
I've got the basics down: levitation, charms, glamours.
I just feel like I've plateaued, Wicca-wise.
What's the next level?
Transmutation.
Conjuring.
Bringing forth something from nothing.
It gets you pretty close to the primal forces.
A little scary.
Well, no one's pushing.
If it's too much, don't do it.
Don't do it?
What kind of encouragement is that?
This is an encouragement talk?
I thought it was "share my pain".
I don't know.
Then again, what is college for if not experimenting?
You know?
Maybe I can handle it.
I'll know when I've reached my limit.
- Wine coolers?
- Magic.
- Didn't encourage her, did you?
- Where's Supportive Boyfriend Guy?
Picking up your dry cleaning.
He told me to tell you he's afraid you're gonna get hurt.
OK, Brutus.
Brutus.
Caesar?
Betrayal?
Trusted friend?
Backstabby?
I'm with you on the reference, but I won't lie about the fact that I'm worried.
I know what it's like to have power you can't control.
And every time I start to wolf out I touch something deep, dark.
It's not fun.
Butjust know that, whatever you decide, I'll back your play.
See?
Concerned Boy.
Sweet Boy.
I know.
I kinda like him worrying, anyway.
You know, I forgot to be hungry.
Wait, Buffy.
Buffy.
Don't letjerky Parker chase you away.
He didn't.
I just don't wanna deal with this right now.
Taking a holiday from dealing.
Happily vacationing in the land of Not Coping.
You'll feel better at the party tonight.
Maybe you'll even meet someone.
I don't wanna meet someone.
I've reached my quota on someones.
I'm gonna have to patrol anyway.
Tonight?
But it's Halloween.
I'll double-check with Giles, but I'm sure he'll think I should be on slayer duty.
He doesn't care about Halloween.
Happy Hal Hello, Buffy.
Oh, my God.
- It's a sombrero.
- And it's on your head.
It seemed festive.
Come in.
Candy?
What's going on here?
You hate Halloween.
I've never said any such thing.
As my watcher's duties took precedence, I simply hadn't taken time to embrace its inherent charms.
Until now.
Look.
It's alive.
See how he shakes.
- Is there something you wanted?
- I was thinking I'd patrol tonight.
Possibly the cemetery.
Or ifyou had a better - Could you please take that off?
- Yes.
Of course.
I see.
Is there some specific danger you were sensing?
No.
But we were caught off-guard when Ethan turned everyone into their costumes.
What happened then was anomalous.
Creatures ofthe night shy away from Halloween.
They find it too crass.
Hard to believe.
Well I promise you Little likelihood of any supernatural activity tonight.
Sure you don't want one?
I come bearing spiders.
Sound system's not gonna cut it.
Nothin' but lame.
You want me to call Oz?
He could probably hook us up.
Do it.
Ifwe're not scaring the young women, they will not fall into our arms.
We'll have womanless arms.
Halloween's not about thrills, chills and funny costumes.
It's about getting laid.
Is there a holiday that's not about getting laid?
Arbor Day.
- Call Oz, dude.
- Done.
And you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs.
Something mystical.
Check this out.
Anya, you really have to get this knocking thing down.
- How did you?
- Your uncle Rory let me in.
- Does he always smell like peppermint?
- The man likes his schnapps.
- What are you doing here?
- You haven't called.
Not once.
- You said you were over me.
- And you just accepted that?
I said what I thought you wanted to hear.
Well, I tend to hear the actual words people say and accept them at face value.
- That's stupid.
- I accept that.
I can't say seeing you falls into the realm of a bad thing.
Really?
I thought maybe we could go out tonight, for our anniversary.
Anniversary?
It's been exactly one week since we copulated.
Did you forget?
No.
Of course not.
It's just I already have plans with Buffy, Willow and Oz.
- It's Halloween, you know.
- I don't understand.
Every October 31st, we mortals dress up No, no, I understand that inane ritual.
It's those people.
You associate with them, though you share little in common.
What are you talkin' about?
I mean, they go to college.
You don't.
They no longer live at home.
You do.
Well, those things The bonds oftrue friendships transcend Could we change the subject?
OK.
Don't get upset with me.
I just wondered.
Ifyou want, you can come with me tonight to this party.
You mean like a date?
Is that what this is?
Are we dating?
There are definitely date-like qualities at work here.
- You'll need a costume.
- A costume?
Dress up.
You know, something scary.
Scary?
Scary how?
Anya, you, ex-demon, terrorised mankind for centuries.
I'm sure you'll come up with something.
Excuse me, Professor Walsh.
I came to get today's assignments.
I couldn't make it to class, for personal reasons.
Right.
I count four limbs, a head, no visible scarring, so I assume your personal issue wasn't life-threatening, and am therefore uninterested.
You got problems, solve 'em on your own time.
Miss another class and you're out.
She means it, you know.
Yeah.
I got the impression she wasn't saying it to make me laugh.
Your work's taken a downturn lately.
I can't remember the last time I saw your hand up.
Does stretching count?
Look, things get pretty intense freshman year, as I dimly recall.
Too much fun or not enough?
Both, actually.
You gotta keep your priorities.
Professor Walsh is worth your time.
Thanks.
I'll get this done tonight.
Tonight.
It's Halloween.
You're not gonna dress up and party?
I have a lot ofwork to do.
It's not really my business, but you seem like a person who makes things really hard on themselves.
Halloween isn't a night for responsibility.
It's when the ghosts and goblins come out.
That's actually a misnomer.
I didn't mean real ones.
But there is good scary fun on campus tonight.
- What are you doing?
- I am gonna sit here and grade papers.
Scary.
Very.
Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach.
Don't make fun.
I worked hard to get this pompous.
No, I mean it.
You're welcome.
OK, watch your step, boys.
Paint's still wet in a few spots.
Thanks for the loan, man.
Our sound system sucks.
MiCasio es su Casio.
Well, that's an interesting little design.
What does it mean?
No clue.
I got it out ofthis book Grapes!
Wow, peeled.
You guys know how to spoil your guests.
Eyeballs, man.
Blindfold chicks, put their hands in the bowl, then tell them it's eyeballs.
They love that.
And I was wasting time buying them flowers and complimenting them on their shoes.
So, you go through the whole house of horrors downstairs and it ends up here.
Sweet.
You fratly guys have a nice setup.
Mighty Alpha Delts.
You should think about pledging.
Xander's a civilian.
A townie?
I didn't know.
You look so normal.
- Sure we should let him come to the party?
- Standing right here.
Cranking!
- Sensing a disturbance in the Force, master?
- Left speaker's crackling.
And stabbing it is the proper solution?
I'm just gonna trim the wire.
It might be a short.
Oz?
Cut myself.
It's OK.
Playing with knives?
Fun.
Yes.
But not safe.
And when you bleed to death I got dibs on your equipment.
- Thanks again for doing this.
- I'm just glad I could find it.
There.
Try it now.
I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the hood.
That feels better.
Oh, no.
Someone's getting Nostalgic Face.
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking about that little girl who wore that.
What is it?
Five?
Six years ago?
When Little Red Riding Hood was the cutting edge in costumes.
Your father loved to take you out.
He was such a pain.
12 years old and no trick-or-treating by myself?
- He just wanted to keep you safe.
- He wanted the candy.
I was just the beard.
That's not true, actually.
The candy was for me.
Your father loved spending time with you.
Not enough, I guess.
Buffy.
Thatjust paved right over Memory Lane.
You know the divorce had nothing to do with you.
I don't know.
I'm starting to feel like there's a pattern here.
Open your heart to someone and he bails on you.
Maybe it's easier to just not let anyone in.
I thought it might be easier.
You must've noticed I'm not the social butterfly that I was when I was with your dad.
I don't think I made a single new friend the year we moved to Sunnydale.
Why not?
Fear.
I didn't believe I could trust anyone again.
It's taken time and a lot of effort, but I've got a nice circle offriends now.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still a little gun-shy.
It certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend turned out to be a homicidal robot.
I will always be here for you.
And you've got Mr Giles and your friends.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
No, I'll just meet you at your place.
Buffy said she was coming, but I haven't seen her.
We have to make sure she has fun.
We have to force fun upon her.
And if Parker shows up, we'll just axe-murder him.
That's Halloweeny.
OK.
See you in a bit.
You gonna stop by the room?
I'm late for battle or I would.
I love your outfit, though.
- There is nothing going on here.
- I saw you flirting with her.
Do we have to do this every time?
I love you.
You know that.
OK, Rach, what's in the next one?
- You guys are sick.
- Here, give me your hand.
This is gross.
Eyeballs, Rachel.
They're eyeballs.
Hey, Red.
What you got in the basket, little girl?
Weapons.
Just in case.
- Like the tux, Xander.
- Bond.
James Bond.
In case we get turned into our costumes again, I'm going for Cool Secret-Agent Guy.
I hate to break it to you, but you'll probably end up Cool Headwaiter Guy.
As long as I'm cool and wield some kind of power.
Will.
Medieval Will.
Hail, ye old varletty, thou.
I'm Joan ofArc.
I figured we had a lot in common, seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake.
And plus she had that close relationship with God.
And you are?
Of course.
I wish I'd thought ofthat before I put down my deposit.
I could've been God.
Blasphemer.
Nice costumes.
Very stealthy.
What are they supposed to be?
NATO?
I invited Anya to join us, but she's having some trouble finding a scary costume, so she's just gonna meet us there.
Perfect.
Everybody's got a date but third-wheel Buffy.
- You're not a third wheel.
- Technically speaking, you're a fifth wheel.
We're gonna have the best time.
Let the horrors begin.
God help me.
Release me.
The joint's notjumpin'.
Where is everybody?
Follow the signs.
Terrifying.
If I were Abbott and Costello, this would be fairly traumatic.
Cobweb.
OK, that part was realistic.
Frat boys aren't too obsessive with their cleaning.
It might not be decoration per se.
I wasn't scared.
I was in the spirit.
And we'll back you up on that.
Even ifthey question us separately.
Get it off.
- It's gone.
- OK, that is not sanitary.
Let's get to the party part ofthe party.
Yeah.
- Are you sure it's off me?
- Yeah.
I thought this led to What is it?
Blood.
Real blood.
OK, actual creeps have been given.
Bravo, frat boys.
Do you hear something?
Like a squeaking noise?
It's these rented shoes.
Patent leather.
No, no, no.
Wait.
It's something else.
I hear it, too.
It's something like - Oz, don't.
It might be - Rubber.
It's made of rubber.
What the hell is going on here?
Look, maybe it's nothing.
Maybe it's just a neat trick.
Something done with wires or Release me!
Or it might be something else.
Where's the door?
Hello.
Help me!
Help me, please!
Xander.
Where's the stairs?
Where's the door?
This is the way we came in, right?
We just went in a circle.
Thank the Lord.
You're welcome.
I have a neat idea.
Let's get out of here.
- You were so anxious for me to come.
- We don't know what we're dealing with.
OK, my turn.
Does anyone hear that?
Well, as soon as we start dealing with it Do you hear something?
Like I said, it sounds like a hissing.
It's like a "ssss" noise.
I thought the word "hissing" kind of covered that nicely.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Sorry.
- Chaz?
- Didn't know.
What's happening?
It - What is it?
- It's alive.
What's alive?
- He's in shock.
- Chaz, what happened here?
- I think the cape took most of it.
- It could need stitches.
At least get a bandage.
Cowering in a closet seems like a reasonable plan.
What closet?
I'm gonna go upstairs and see ifthere are people up there.
Ifyou guys find a way out ofthe house, use it.
You're telling us to run away and leave you behind?
We need help.
We need the only person that can make sense ofwhat's happening.
Just a minute.
Coming.
Happy Ha Xander's in trouble.
You've gotta do something now.
Are you listening?
Xander's trapped.
- Where's Buffy and the others?
- Trapped, but we've gotta save Xander.
Slow down.
I need you to be more specific.
We were supposed to meet at this house.
I got there and there was no door where a door should be.
I see a girl standing in a window, and then "poof"!
She's gone.
- She vanished from the window?
- No, the window vanished from the house.
Matter-and-reality distortion.
Like a summoning spell's temporal flux.
What?
Never mind.
I just need to get some supplies together.
I wouldn't worry about Xander.
At least he's amongst friends.
- I'm telling you - You're telling me?
- I can't do myjob if I'm worrying about you.
- It's not your decision.
- Gotta disagree with you there.
- Of course you do.
Let's all take a breath.
Buffy Being the Slayer doesn't make you the boss.
You're as lost as the rest of us.
What are we talking about?
It's a simple incantation.
A guiding spell for travellers when they get lost or disoriented.
How's it work?
It conjures an emissary from the beyond that lights the way.
Conjuring.
Will, let's be realistic here.
Your basic spells are usually only fifty-fifty.
Yeah?
Well, so's your face.
What?
What does that mean?
I'm not your sidekick.
Will, hang on.
Well, that was a bunch of laughs.
Look, Buffy, we're all tired and a little edgy.
Maybe Willow's overreacting.
Part of it's because you've been Pushing Away Girl lately.
But now's not the time to let that stufftear us apart.
What I'm saying is, I'm right with ya.
Right by your side.
Xander?
Funny how you still haven't lost your sense of inappropriate humour.
Xander, where did you go?
Buffy, knock it off.
The skit's over.
I'm right here.
This is so typical of him.
Typical?
Xander?
Buffy!
Buff?
She thinks I'm not ready to be a full-blown witch.
I can handle the dark forces as good as anyone else.
It's not that hard.
It's just a guiding spell, and I'm careful an' all.
This floor used to have windows.
Look.
We found the stairs.
Buffy didn't find stairs.
No, sir.
I don't think you guys are thinking clearly.
We just need to get up to the goat room and - Willow, something's happening.
- Something good?
Oh, no.
Not good.
I'm changing.
But you can't.
There's no moon tonight.
I have to get away.
No.
We need to find something to restrain you, like a rope or chains or something.
There's no time.
I can do the guiding spell.
I know I can make it work.
- Will, please.
- No!
No!
Oz!
Oz, don't leave me.
There I am.
I didn't go anywhere.
Great.
Now I just got to live with the fact that no one else can see me.
I can see you.
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change OK.
OK.
Aradia, Goddess ofthe Lost, the path is murky, the woods are dense.
Darkness pervades.
I beseech thee, bring the light.
I did it.
I did you.
Hi.
Right.
You're waiting for instructions.
Lead me to Oz.
Wait.
I should try to find the people trapped upstairs first.
But we still have to find a way out ofthe house.
OK, here's what we should do.
What's going on?
Stop.
Stop it.
Get off.
Oz!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Oz!
Someone help!
Willow.
Basement.
I must be in the basement?
All alone.
Who said that?
They all ran away from you.
They always will.
Open your heart to someone and Don't fret, little girl.
You're not alone.
Any more.
Well?
We're gonna have to create a door.
Create a door?
You can do that?
I can.
No matter how hard you fight, you just end up in the same place.
I don't see why you bother.
I'm upstairs.
The goat room.
Oz?
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off!
Willow.
- What's wrong?
- Couldn't get 'em off It's OK.
We're OK.
We're not OK.
We need to get out of here.
I'd offer my opinion, but you jerks aren't gonna hear it.
Not that Didn't Go To College Boy has anything important to say.
I might as well hang out with Bleeding Dummy Head What is wrong with you?
You heard that?
You can see me?
Good.
Oh, God, good!
The house separated us.
Like it wanted to scare us.
But we got away.
No.
We were brought here.
We all got so scared that we ended up here.
Why?
I saw them painting that.
They were copying out of that.
- I think it's Gaelic.
- Can you translate?
Release me.
- Will, give me something.
- OK.
The icon's called the Mark of Gachnar.
I think this is a summoning spell for something called Gachnar?
Well, yes.
Somehow the beginning ofthe spell must've been triggered.
Gachnar's trying to manifest itself to come into being.
- How?
- It feeds on fear.
Our fears are manifesting.
We're feeding it.
We need to stop.
Ifwe close our eyes and say it's a dream, it'll stab us to death.
These things are real.
OK, so our fears are feeding it.
Ifwe get everyone out of here Good plan.
Let's go.
Giles?
Everyone, it's Giles.
With a chain saw.
- Glad you could make it.
- The wall's closed up behind us.
Gachnar.
Of course.
Its presence infects the reality ofthe house, but it's not achieved full manifestation.
We cannot allow this to come into being.
But if it does, I can fight it, right?
Buffy - This is Gachnar.
- I don't wanna fight that.
- So we break the spell.
- Let's do it fast.
I have it.
"The summoning spell for Gachnar can be shut down in one oftwo ways".
"Destroying the Mark of Gachnar is not one ofthem, and will immediately bring forth the fear demon itself".
Look.
This is Gachnar?
Big overture.
Little show.
I am the Dark Lord of Nightmares.
The bringer ofterror.
Tremble before me.
Fear me.
He's so cute.
Who's a little fear demon?
Come on.
Don't taunt the fear demon.
- Why, can he hurt me?
- No, it's just tacky.
Be that as it may, Buffy, when it comes to slaying - Size doesn't matter?
- They're all going to abandon you, you know.
Yeah, yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Parker Abrams.
I'm at Kresky Hall.
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Whatare you doing?
- Making a choice.
- Parker, didl do something wrong?
- Didn'tyou have fun?
- Is that all it was?
- Well, what else was it supposed to be?
He's manipulative andshallow.
And why doesn'the wantme?
Say "hi" to Non-College Guy.
Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys usually populate the non-campus?
Townie, huh?
You look so normal.
- Buffy?
- Parker?
Stay down.
Buffy.
Buffy.
I don't know what to say.
After how I've treated you, now I owe you my life.
- It's nothing.
- It's everything.
You're everything.
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you to forgive me.
Do you think one day you might?
No.
These are the things we want.
Simple things.
Comfort, sex, shelter, food.
We always want them and we want them all the time.
The id doesn't learn, it doesn't grow up.
It has the ego telling it what it can't have and it has the superego telling it what it shouldn't want.
But the id works solely out ofthe pleasure principle.
It wants.
Whatever social skills we have, however much we've evolved, - the pleasure principle works in all of us.
- Really?
So, how does this conflict with the ego manifest itself in the psyche?
What do we do when we can't have what we want?
Buffy, I don't know what to say.
After how I've treated you, and now I owe you my life.
Can you ever forgive me?
Rough day?
Come on, Buff, be a lonely drunk.
- Rough day?
- Stop flicking at me.
Work with me here.
I'm finally an essential part ofyour collegey life.
No more looking down on the townie.
I'm the new bartender over at the pub.
Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face.
- Aren't you too young to be a bartender?
- Au contraire, mon frère.
- "Mon frère" means "brother".
- Mon girl frère.
Behold.
I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.
- What gives it away?
- Looking at it.
Well, no one's gonna see it anyway.
Now I'm the bartender.
I kick people out.
You know there's more to it than wiping and kicking?
Mixing drinks, for instance?
I've seen Cocktail.
I can do the hippy hippy shake.
Even if I had a pretend cigarette, I couldn't tell you my pretend problems.
Real ones have clogged up my head space.
Then unload 'em right here, baby.
Rough day?
You wanna talk about it?
- Shutting up now.
- I'm pregnant by my stepbrother, who'd rather be with my best friend, and he's left me with no place to live, no food - except for this bottle ofWild Turkey which I drank all up.
That was me being tanked and friendless for ya.
- Gets my Oscar nod.
- You know what?
It's class time.
- Are you gonna come by tonight, to the pub?
- Oz.
Bronze.
Date.
You know, maybe maybe he's just having trouble dealing.
I mean, don't guys sometimes keep the girls they really, really like inside these deep little brain-fantasy bubbles where everything's perfect?
- I mean, they do that, right?
- How's the fugue state coming along?
- Parker.
- Maybe I'm in his bubble, and pretty soon, he'll realise that he wants more than just Bubble Buffy and he'll pop me out and we'll go to dinner and It could happen, right?
Buffy, that is my best friend, you need to think about not-Parker.
He's no good.
There are men, better men, wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.
Nothing can defeat the penis.
Too loud and very unseemly.
I mean, I'm sorry to be so coarse, but I feel strongly about stinky Parker man.
He can be really sweet.
I think that he has intimacy problems because ofthe death of his father.
Not interested.
You got troubles, tell 'em to the bartender.
The bartender's always ready to listen.
- What?
What?
- For the last time, a pitcher of beer.
OK.
And you had a rum and Coke, and you had a Poker's Light.
And a vodka on the rocks.
And a water.
Is that right?
- Do I have to write it down?
- A cold ale.
- A glass of iced water.
- A lager, a white wine - and a daiquiri.
- A simple request.
Iced water.
Do you want that on the rocks?
- Oh, Riley.
So sorry.
- It's OK.
You know, most people go around.
I'm not saying you can't tunnel through me, but the other way is quicker.
In my defence, you do take up a lot of space.
I do.
I'm ungainly.
You looking for someone?
I just saw Parker over there.
Right.
Parker and his latest conquest.
That boy should have his attention span checked.
He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?
Sets 'em up and knocks 'em down.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my father says ifyou wanna be a gentleman, you don't even care what my father says.
I'm sorry.
What?
Forget about it.
You know, I've got some people waiting.
I'll see you in class, right?
- Rough day?
- No, it's been super.
We accepted Melody's pledge and made her a sister of Beta Delta Gamma.
And our pins arrived today.
I designed it myself.
You are so sharp.
Hey, Paula.
You keeping this fine bartender from his duty?
- A man's gotta make a living.
- It's all right.
So the guys and l, we're celebrating I said it's all right.
I'm due for a break.
So what were you discussing?
Maybe we can all join.
- Be nice.
- What?
- Forget it.
- No, no.
I rudely interrupted.
It sounds like the two ofyou were having quite the meeting of minds.
Debating the geopolitical ramifications of bioengineering?
You have a take on that?
I've got beer.
You want some beer?
Yeah.
A pitcher of Black Frost.
I think we have a perfect venue here for conducting a little sociometry.
A bipolar continuum of attraction and rejection.
Now, given your socioeconomic statuses, I foresee a B rejects A dyad.
I'm sorry, let me clarify.
You see, we are the future ofthis country and you keep the bowl of peanuts full.
We are what these girls want.
And four glasses.
How's about I see some ID?
You're not getting a drop until Just give him a beer.
Thanks.
Buffy?
Rough day?
Wanna tell me about it?
It's just Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it.
And I knew it.
I knew what he was.
If he were tied and gagged and left in a cave that vampires happen to frequent, it wouldn't really be like I killed him, really.
- Buffy.
- I'm a slut.
- No.
- Idiot.
No.
You gotta stop being so hard on Sorry.
So sorry.
I'm better.
This has helped.
Do not go anywhere.
I am so sorry.
I just I seem to be bumping into people today.
I can't imagine anybody minding.
You're not thinking of leaving, are you?
We have a very strict policy against you leaving.
At least until you've had a drink.
Yeah.
What my friend's just saying is, you shouldn't be sad and alone right now.
I mean, you're a very beautiful girl who should be covered with men.
And could we be those men?
It's on us.
Hey.
You got a table.
- I had to kill a man.
- Well, it's a really good table.
I copied out my notes for psych since you were so elsewhere this morning.
- Thanks.
- It's really pretty simple stuff.
You know - What's the matter?
- I don't know.
I feel It's nothing.
We could go back to your place.
I could make you soup.
No.
That's OK, I'm fine.
Thanks.
Do you know her?
Veruca?
No.
I know their drummer.
He's cool.
I've never heard them play.
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
What modern-day pundits fail to realise is all the socioeconomic and psychological problems inherent in modern society can be solved by the judicious application ofway too much beer.
Black Frost is the only beer.
My mother always said beer is evil.
Evil, good.
These are moral absolutes that predate the fermentation of malt and fine hops.
See - Wait, where was l?
- I'm really not sure.
- Well, Thomas Aquinas - No.
- There will be no Thomas Aquinas here.
- Keep your theology of Providence, fat boy.
- I was just drawing a parallel - Beer.
Had morality developed under the influence of beer, there would be no good or evil.
There would be "kinda nice" and "pretty cool".
Everything would be different.
- You guys love to hear yourselves speak.
- We're losing her, guys.
- Be interesting.
- Tell us about yourself.
- Yeah.
What do you like?
- Well, I don't hate this, for a start.
Yep.
"My name's Veruca.
I'm in a band".
"I'm Oz.
I'm in a band, too".
"And this is Willow".
"How fun.
A groupie".
Groupie.
Buff, have you heard ofthis Veruca chick?
Dresses like Faith, voice like an albatross.
TV is a good thing.
Bright colours.
Music.
Tiny little people.
What have you done with Buffy?
I'm suffering the afterness of a bad night of badness.
You didn't?
Not with Parker again?
No, with four really smart guys.
Four?
Buffy, are you OK?
I mean, do you wanna talk about it?
I went to see Xander.
Then I saw Parker.
Then came beer.
And then group sex?
Gutterface.
No.
Just lots and lots of beer.
It's nice.
Foamy.
Comforting.
It's beer.
Drowning your troubles over Parker.
Mind-Frying Man.
He deserves a torturous and slow death by spider bites.
Well, for today we'll just have to throw spitballs at his neck in class.
OK.
But getting dressed would be fun, too.
Next class, we'll move on to personality types and disorders.
For those ofyou who have done the reading, you already know - Yes?
- She read the reading.
Well then, she'll have some time on her hands.
As I was saying, we won't be able to cover it all in class.
But that doesn't mean it isn't worth knowing, or that it won't be on the midterm.
Now, if I've been unclear in any way, speak now.
- Buffy.
- Now, before you go - get the worksheet from the TA.
- Buffy, are you OK?
- Based on that, choose three essay titles - Sure.
Why wouldn't I be?
It's good.
Mm, good.
Enough.
No.
More is good.
Yeah.
Foamy.
You should come to our class on big thinking.
It's good.
Yeah.
Boy, I'm having the worst day.
You got a light?
- I like girls.
- You stupid.
- No, you stupid.
- No, you stupid.
Smelly head.
Willow.
Hey.
- I tried calling.
- Yeah, I've been at the library.
- How are you feeling?
- What do you mean?
- Well, you weren't in class.
Again.
- Band was practising.
- Hey, Shy's playing again tonight.
- Shy?
Yeah, Veruca's band.
And they asked me to sit in with them.
- It would be kinda cool ifyou were there.
- Two Veruca shows in two nights?
Are you sure you wanna share your groupie?
I think I'm just gonna study, cos ofthe fun.
Yeah, I guess I could see how it'd be dull for ya.
See ya.
Yeah.
You stupid.
No, you stupid.
No, you.
You.
It sings.
- Like it.
- It's time to go home, Buffy.
Want more singing.
Want more beer.
No, I've cut you off.
Did it hurt?
Out you go.
Want beer.
Like beer.
Beer good.
Beer bad.
Bad, bad beer.
What the hell am I saying?
Buffy, go home and go to bed.
- Say "bye".
- Bye.
Bye.
Where girl go?
Hey.
- Did you want something?
- Yes.
I want to give you a piece of my mind.
I'm tired ofyou men and your man-ness.
Buffy's really hurting right now.
In fact, she's in need of a big mental tidy.
Parker, how could you do this to her?
- I don't get what you mean.
What did I do?
- She shared something intimate with you.
And you act like it's nothing more than a bag of some kind of sack food.
Willow, I'm not sure I need to explain my actions here, but ifthat's what you want Yes, followed by an admission of undeniable guilt.
But go on.
Some relationships centre on a deep emotional tie.
Or a loyal friendship.
Or something.
But most are just two people passing through life, enriching or aggravating each other's lives briefly.
Go on.
Just for one night, can't two people who feel an attraction come together and create something wonderful?
Then go back to their lives, better for it, but never overanalysing it or wanting it to be more than it was?
I have.
She should too.
People like Buffy, and me, assume that intimacy means friendship and respect.
People shouldn't have to ask first: "Are you gonna be eyeing other prospects tomorrow"?
People shouldn't have to preface casual sex with: "Just so you know, I'll never grow any older with you".
It takes the fire out of it.
Maybe.
Willow, I don't regret what happened.
Or what we did.
But I am sorry that Buffy's hurting, and if I misled her, I'm sorry for that.
I didn't mean to.
I'm impressed that you care so much about her.
You're a good friend.
All right, time to pay up and go home, guys.
Let's see, I'll take this one and this one.
And, you know, I've always had a problem calculating the tip.
You guys being so dapper of brain, maybe you can help me out.
OK, great.
See, ifyour bill comes to $38 and generally people tip what, approximately 30%?
That makes your tip what?
You are so smart.
This is so the right amount.
Somebody didn't have their fibre today.
Are you all right in there?
Buddy?
- Oh, God.
- Let's get outta here.
Easy.
We're cool.
Help.
Oh, God.
Fire bad.
Fire fire pretty.
Fire angry.
Jack?
Jack?
We got a problem.
The guys, they They're Some ofyour patrons are turning into cavemen.
They had it coming.
I've been taking abuse from snot-nosed kids for 20 years.
They're always in here with their snotty attitudes, drinking their fruity microbrews, spouting some philosophy like it means a damn thing.
- Thinking they're different than us.
- They are now.
They ain't.
That's the great thing about beer.
It makes all men the same.
Why are we talking about beer?
The guys are The beer.
Neat, huh?
My brother-in-law's a warlock.
He showed me how.
No.
No neat.
I served them that beer.
I served Buffy that beer.
How much beer does a person need to consume before they start questing for fire?
Relax.
It'll wear off in a day or so.
In a day or so someone can get killed.
You're a bad, bad man.
I didn't see him.
Is he OK?
- I cut her off.
She didn't drink as much.
- I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.
- I didn't know it was evil.
- You knew it was beer.
Excuse me, Mr "I spent the '60s in an electric Kool-Aid funky Satan groove".
Early '70s, and you should know better.
I'm not the dad of her.
Buffy's a grown-up.
She's intelligent enough to Parker bad.
I don't mean this in a bragging way, but I do get to know a lot ofwomen.
Well, getting to know people is good.
But I haven't found "the one" yet.
I've yet to find a girl that I can just, you know, sit with, feeling totally at ease, spewing whatever's on my mind.
Or even sit with comfortably in silence.
Willow, can I tell you something kind of private?
OK.
I mean, I feel you've shown me a perspective I hadn't really thought much about before.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
Just that I've enjoyed talking with you - here, tonight.
Me, too.
I mean, with you.
You know, I'm wondering something.
About you.
What?
Just how gullible do you think I am?
I mean, with your gentle eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly only to me?
- You're unbelievable.
- What?
This isn't sharing.
This isn't connecting.
It's the pleasure principle.
That's right, I got your number, ld Boy.
All you're thinking about is how long before you can jump on my bones.
- Look, ifyou think that I'm - I mean, you men.
It's all about the sex.
You find a woman, drag her to your den, do whatever's necessary as long as you get sex.
Men haven't changed since the dawn oftime.
See?
Fascinating, really.
Want people.
Where people go?
The TV is off.
Want.
Want people.
She doesn't appear to be in any immediate danger.
Maybe you should stay with her.
Boy smell nice.
Or perhaps she should be left alone.
Yeah, I think we need to track down the fun boys somewhat pronto.
- Jack said the effects ofthe beer wear off.
- Beer?
- Buffy want beer.
- No.
You can't have beer.
Want beer.
Giles, don't make Cave Slayer unhappy.
- Buffy strong.
- Yes, Buffy strong.
- Buffy get beer.
- Buffy get - Giles.
- I'm fine.
Just get her.
Which way?
Check down there.
Find her before someone gets hurt.
Woman.
Man.
Woman.
Buffy.
Can't find the beer.
Good.
Freshman girl not able to hold the beer.
Shouldn't have it.
Get into trouble.
We're good.
Remember the boy?
Boy smell nice, yeah?
Is there any part of Buffy still in there?
Oh, no.
Fire bad.
Buffy?
Where the hell's Giles?
Blonde.
About this tall.
She walks with a sort of a sideways limp.
Bad.
Bad.
Buffy?
Stay.
- Are you all right?
- Buffy's still in there.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Help me.
I can't breathe.
Buffy.
What do we do?
Oh, God.
Did you guys have enough fun for one night?
Yes.
Please Buffy tired.
And was there a lesson in all this, huh?
What did we learn about beer?
- Foamy.
- Good.
Just as long as that's clear.
Anyways, I think the boys in the car are contained for the time being.
It'll give 'em time to ponder the geopolitical ramifications of being mean to me.
- Whose van is that?
- I don't know.
It wasn't locked.
Buffy.
Buffy, I don't know how to say this.
I'm sorry for how I treated you before.
It was wrong of me and I'm sorry.
You were great tonight, really.
I may not deserve this, but do you think you could forgive me?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Thanks for the relocate.
I perform better without an audience.
You were thinking, what, a little helpless co-ed before bed?
You know very well, you eat this late you're gonna get heartburn.
Get it?
Heartburn?
That's it?
That's all I get?
One lame-ass vamp with no appreciation for my painstakingly thought-out puns.
I don't think the forces of darkness are even trying.
I mean, you could make a little effort here, you know?
Give me something to work with.
Watch your mouth, little girl.
You should know better than to tempt the Fates that way.
Cos the Big Bad is back.
And this time The Bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?
Cos ofthe gloating factor alone, you know.
We're all about college now.
We've got heady discourse.
No curfews, mom-and-popless hootenanny.
Co-ed dating prospects who find townies sexy and dangerous.
- What, I can dream.
- Right.
So if college is so great, why are we here and why is it more fun?
Because the Bronze is nice and familiar.
It's like a big, comfy blanky.
I was under the impression that I was your big, comfy blanky.
You're my person blanky.
This is my place blanky.
With all the shock ofthe new, it's nice to have one place that you can come back to where everything's predictable.
- Hello, all.
- Giles, trouble?
Oh, no, Buffy.
Don't get up.
Nothing like that.
I just, you know, I thought I'd drop by.
Latte, anyone?
On me?
So much for your "predictable blanky" theory, Will.
Sorry.
Splendid.
Well, it's ages since I've been to a gig.
Well, don't look that way.
I'm down with the new music.
And I have the albums to prove it.
Yes, but it's your cutting-edge eight-tracks that keep you ahead.
Don't scoff.
I've seen Giles' collection.
- He was an animal in his day.
- Thank you.
OK, why not?
lfthe Stones can still keep rolling, why can't Giles?
Exactly.
I think it's brave that you're here.
Well, thank you, all.
You've made me feel right at home.
Well, isn't home that empty place you're trying to escape?
Dip a finger in me And paste my word - Oh, yeah.
Veruca's playing tonight.
- Yeah, every Wednesday.
I told you.
Let me be distraction Let me be dream So, Oz, what about Dingoes?
When are you guys here again?
Oh, we're up next Friday.
Dip a finger in me They're good, aren't they?
Nothing special.
Yeah.
She's quelle Fiona.
Colour me bored.
Really?
I think she's rather remarkable.
Such presence for someone her age.
I can feel you twist I can feel you writhe Because you're with me It's in the sandblaster.
What's in the sandblaster, Will?
It's a dream.
Come back to me.
All Geminis to the raspberry hats.
- Now you're fakin'.
- Am not.
Just a little.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Bad dream?
- I guess.
But the waking-up part makes up for it.
It's always so busy in there.
Not always.
A few things shut my brain up completely.
Anything I can help you with?
I gotta get to class right now but tonight for sure.
I don't know about tonight, unless the extreme Jerry Garcia look turns you on.
Night before the full moon.
Oh, that's right.
And I have a thing.
There's this Wicca group on campus I wanted to check out.
They have orientation on the three nights you're wolfy.
And it's probably totally silly, but Well, go.
Show 'em how it's done.
Are you sure?
You can lock yourself up?
It's only this one month.
After orientation they meet on different nights.
I'll be fine.
OK.
As long as you don't mind.
The only thing I mind is being away from you for three nights.
Ms Summers, I want you to prepare to lead a discussion group next class on the paper topic.
- That was smart work.
- What do I have to do?
Ifyou have any questions, bring them up with one ofthe TAs.
Are you OK?
How'd you do?
This is good.
I mean, this is excellent.
You did better than me.
This is so unfair.
You made me jealous ofyou academically.
Buffy!
I know.
Can you believe it?
Wow.
I guess Professor Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
And she wants me to lead a discussion group next class.
That means more work, right?
Shouldn't she have a better reward system?
You know, like a cookie or a toy surprise, like at the dentist?
She wants you to lead a discussion group?
OK.
Jealous again.
Jealous, jealous OK, I'm back.
Hey, I'm meeting Oz at the café.
You wanna come?
I'll buy you that celebratory cookie.
Great.
I'm TA-bound now and then I will catch up with you guys.
Cool.
What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?
- My girlfriend's comin'.
- There's room.
Big lunch.
I like to eat.
I hate chicks who are, like, "Does it have dressing on it"?
Agreed.
- You guys were tight last night.
- I guess.
- The amps still sound dirty to me.
- What are you using?
50 or 120?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
You wanna sit down?
So you should be using a 50.
Blue Voodoo - not your best bet unless you dig the distort.
Music talk, huh?
Cool.
I love to listen to Oz talk about the biz.
What do you like again?
I know you told me.
There's a couple of good ones.
The Johnson Mil.
- The No.
1 is Redbone.
- No.
1?
No.
I gotta go with Hound Dog.
Me too.
That's a great song.
I mean, Elvis, what a guy.
- You a big Elvis fan?
- The biggest.
Well, I mean, after Dingoes, of course.
We're actually talking amps.
But it's easy to get confused, the names they give 'em.
You know, I gotta bail.
I'll call you later.
I should go, too.
Good shirt.
Check out the rapid exits.
Was it me?
Me.
I don't speak musicianese.
How come you didn't tell me I look like a crazy birthday cake in this shirt?
- I thought that was the point.
- He thinks she's sexy.
He gets this blushy thing going on behind his ears.
- That's for me only.
- It doesn't mean anything.
So Oz checks out another girl.
He loves you.
I know.
I know.
And I don't wanna be the kind of girl who freaks every time my boyfriend notices somebody else.
I mean, I have wrong feelings about other guys sometimes, but I feel guilty and I flog and punish.
Exactly.
I'm sure Oz is flogging and punishing himself This is sounding wrong before I even finish.
Look, I promise you, in a couple of days it's gonna be like "Veruca who"?
- You think?
- Absolutely.
Oz just isn't the type to stray.
Not tonight, anyways.
He'll be locked in a cage.
Hello?
Oh, God!
Morning.
That was some night.
So it appears.
Right.
You don't remember.
It's like that at first, but then little bits and pieces'll start coming back to you.
- So you're a - Werewolf groupie.
Nobody else gets it done for me.
- What?
- Kidding.
You know what I am.
You've known since the first time you saw me.
Now, you need to relax.
Not a possibility.
So what do you wanna do?
God!
The kids in this dorm need Fashion 101 in a big way.
Or we could start right here at home.
I'm not making a statement.
Just wanna get back to my place, figure out why we got out of our cages.
- You have a cage?
- Don't you?
Yeah.
It has a little wheel with a plastic ball and a cute little bell in it.
God!
Somebody's domesticated the hell out ofyou.
It's my choice.
I don't wanna hurt anybody.
Maybe.
Or maybe you just don't wanna admit what happened to you.
Maybe you just wanna pretend like you're a regular guy.
Well, I am.
I'm only a wolfthree nights a month.
You're the wolf all the time, and this human face is just your disguise.
You ever think about that, Oz?
I'm going to check the paper, see ifwe did any damage last night.
We did.
But only to each other.
I know some part ofyou remembers that.
It doesn't take a full moon.
We could do it again right here.
We aren't going to.
This ends right now.
I can help you, Oz.
You're scared.
I was, too.
But then I accepted it, the animal.
It's powerful.
Inside me all the time.
Soon you just start to feel sorry for everybody else because they don't know what it's like to be as alive as we are.
As free.
Free to kill people?
I won't do that.
You shouldn't.
You don't understand.
But you will.
You'll see that we belong together.
No.
I know where I belong.
See ya tonight.
Two ofthem.
It was unbelievable.
The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.
Excuse me, Ms Walsh.
Be careful when you walk around campus after dark.
- I was attacked by wild dogs last night.
- Wild dogs?
- Two.
- Biggest things I've ever seen.
The first one was well, for a moment I thought it was a gorilla.
Did you have a question, Buffy?
No.
No, I was just sayin' howdy.
Fine.
See you in class.
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- New look.
- You too.
Laundry day kinda came and went.
Hey, I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday with you and Veruca.
I didn't notice anything.
Really?
Cos I felt all spazzy.
No.
Good.
Guess it was just me worrying for nothin' again.
Me and my busy head, always thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'.
Well, now you can stop.
Everything's fine.
Maybe you could help me stop.
I'd really, really appreciate anything you could do.
What?
What's wrong?
Sorry, l - You don't want to?
- It's not that.
I do.
I just I didn't get any sleep, I guess.
I'm really beat.
Right.
Busy wolf night.
I get it.
It's totally OK.
- Willow, you don't have to - No, I should.
I don't have much time.
I'll see you later.
..
treaty of1648 that ended the Thirty Years' War?
- Peace ofWestphalia.
- Yalta?
- You moron!
- That's incorrect.
That dinette set should be mine.
Buffy!
Excellent!
Come in.
- Hi.
- Can I get you anything?
Tea?
I made a very interesting moussaka last night, ifyou're hungry.
Pass on the tea.
And the moose, thank you.
- You come on business, I hope?
- Yes.
Lucky you, people may be in danger.
- I only meant that I'm at the ready.
- Here's the deal.
One of my professors said that she was almost attacked by two wild dogs last night under the light of a nearly full moon.
- Werewolves.
Two ofthem?
- Could be.
Well, I've not seen anything about the attacks in the newspapers or on the news.
- Have you spoken with Oz?
- My next stop.
Right.
Get right on it.
I'll see what I can find out.
- And you report back to me.
- ASAP.
Promise.
- Hey, Will.
Mom let you in?
- She seemed cranky.
Yeah.
We're having a little landlord-tenant dispute, so I'm withholding rent.
An effective, and might I add, thrifty tactic.
- Why?
- She won't let me put a lock on my door.
I suspect she's afraid I'll start having "the sex".
Yeah.
Parents wait till you're out ofthe house.
- Or under it.
- Or under it, to start worrying about stuff like that.
It's mostly too late.
So, I know why I'm sitting in a dank, sunless little room.
But why are you?
Well, things with Oz are weird.
And I talked to Buffy about it, but I think we're in guyville here.
I need a translator from the "Y" side ofthings.
Well, last time I checked, I had the creds.
Hit me.
What does it mean when a girl wants to you know Ifyou're doing it, I think you should be able to say it.
- Make love.
- Wild monkey love or tender Sarah McLachlan love?
Any kind.
But what ifthe girl wants to and the guy doesn't?
- That's a bad sign, right?
- Could be.
Or she caught him in one ofthe seven annual minutes he's too preoccupied to do it.
- Well, say the girl's been noticing - Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code.
OK.
Say I've been noticing Oz notice someone else.
- A woman.
- And is this chick noticing back?
Most definitely.
Well have you asked Oz about it?
Well, I thought about it, but then he'll think I'm all jealous and worry.
But you are.
And odds are, he feels it.
I'll bet that's all there is to the weird you're feeling.
You guys should talk things out, Will.
You'll both feel better.
Hey.
- Got out, huh?
- Yeah.
- Any news about attacks?
- No.
But I did hear about a woman being chased by two wild dogs.
Two?
Really?
You don't remember anything like that, do you?
Another wolf?
No.
When the change comes, it's like I'm gone.
Total blackout.
Well, if I find werewolf No.
2 out on patrol tonight, you might have a roomie in there.
Oz?
Oz, are you OK?
And if it's possible, you seem more monosyllabic than usual.
I'm OK.
Thanks.
I step out of my skin You wouldn't know me now Couldn't you go away?
Shouldn't l?
Leave me the hard part It's all I want I need I won't be Your soft one I won't be encircled You might become Something I need To destroy So this is why you called me here?
To see your Habitrail?
Right before sunset, I get a little buzzed, you know?
Come here.
I'm not getting in that stupid cage with you, ifthat's what this is all about.
We belong outside.
You can't run loose tonight.
And not just because you might hurt somebody.
I know people that'll be out there, hunting for us.
So you're saying I should spend the whole night with you.
Alone.
Locked in a cage.
You'll be safe.
Not from you.
Isn't that the point ofthis cosy little arrangement?
It's coming.
Do you feel it?
- It's like blood boiling.
- I feel it.
I've wanted you even before I ever saw you.
I sensed you.
Did you sense me?
- Come in here.
- Did you?
- Willow.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I know what you saw.
It wasn't I had to.
I had to lock her in there with me.
I bet.
She's like me.
A wolf.
Well, I knew you two had a lot in common, but Don't touch me!
She was gonna hurt somebody.
I didn't have a choice.
But you did.
You could've told somebody.
Your solution just put you two together in a room all night?
- Girl's got a point.
- Leave.
- I'm just sayin' - Now!
- I'm sorry.
- I knew.
I knew, you jerk.
And you sat there and you told me everything was fine?
And that's as bad as as I know how it feels.
I remember.
So, what, this is payback?
I had this coming?
- No, it's not - Because I thought that was behind us.
And you know, what happened with Xander, it doesn't compare.
Not with what you and I had.
Not with whatever you've been doing with her.
I don't know what Veruca and I have done.
When I change, it's like it's like I'm gone and the wolftakes over.
But before this, when you were regular Oz, you had feelings for her, didn't you?
No.
I could sense something, but But you wanted her.
Like, in an animal way?
Like, more than you wanted me?
Willow!
- Willow, are you OK?
- Thank you.
I was too far away.
It was lucky.
She almost got hit.
Willow, what's the matter?
Maybe you should take her home.
Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourself over.
I have to go.
I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.
I will, though.
When I do, this thing stops.
She's bad news.
Do you want me to get you something before I take off?
Kleenex?
Chocolaty chocolate anything?
No.
I'll come back as soon as this is finished.
I just want you to take it easy, OK?
Riley was right.
The main thing is put the blame where it belongs.
- Don't hurt yourself.
- OK.
OK.
- You're OK?
- I'm fine.
I promise.
I love you.
"Put the blame where it belongs".
So you haven't seen her around?
OK.
Thanks, man.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
I checked all the usual haunts.
But I know the areas we're drawn to.
I'm sure I can follow her scent.
- We'll try that, then.
- Look, Buffy, you should know that Oz.
Now might be a good time for your trademark stoicism.
I conjure thee by Borabis, by Satanis and the devil.
As thou art burning, let Oz and Veruca's deceitful hearts be broken.
This way!
I conjure thee, by the Saracen Queen and in the name of Hell.
Let them find no love or solace.
Let them find no peace as well.
She's near here.
I can smell her.
Or the dirty pile of clothing she left on the ground.
They could be from the other night when she turned into a werewolf.
Unless she wanted to throw you offthe scent.
Willow!
Let this image seal his fate.
Not to love, only hate.
For a minute I thought you might actually play rough.
Sometimes you have to, you know?
To keep what's yours, sometimes you have to kill.
Well, how about that?
The sun's almost down.
Can't say I'm surprised you didn't go through with your little hex.
- You don't have the teeth.
- You don't know what I have.
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know what you love.
I have his scent on me right now.
- Don't touch her again.
- Come stop me.
I like it rough, remember?
You wanna hurt me, hurt me.
You leave her out ofthis.
How can l?
She's the reason you're living in cages.
She's blinding you.
When she's gone, you'll be able to admit what you are.
You don't wanna find out what I am.
You're an animal.
Animals kill.
You're right.
We kill.
Oz?
I'm not quite sure I understand.
There was just so much going on with Oz and Willow.
There still is.
But I just thought you should know.
This fellow in the woods, he was in military garb?
And he was toting some serious weaponry.
The thing is, I saw some guys dressed exactly like him on Halloween night.
I just assumed they were in costume.
- But maybe they were working.
- I wanna know what's up.
The guy got in my way.
I almost didn't catch up with Oz in time.
- And as it was, I was too late to - You saved Willow.
Right now she wishes I hadn't.
Giles, I've never seen her like this.
It's like it hurts too much to form words.
You've felt that way yourself and you got through it.
Yeah.
I ran away and went to hell and then got through it.
- I'm hoping she doesn't use me as a model.
- Fair enough.
I just don't know how they're gonna deal with this.
Hello.
Hi.
What are you doing?
I'm going.
Now?
- That's your solution?
- That's my decision.
- Don't I get any say in this?
- No.
Veruca was right about something.
The wolf is inside me all the time.
And I don't know where that line is any more, between me and it.
And until I figure out what that means, I shouldn't be around you.
Or anybody.
Well, that could be a problem.
Cos people kind of a planetary epidemic.
I'll find someplace.
Well, how long?
I don't know.
Oz, don't you love me?
My whole life I've never loved anything else.
Oh, God.
Oz.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be thathe can'tget enough ofit.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": I've forgotten my manners in all the concussion.
I'm Riley.
I'm a TA.
I'll be helping the professor out.
I'm Professor Walsh.
"The Evil Bitch Monster of Death".
Cos the Big Bad is back.
And this time Women.
Young, nubile, exciting.
Each one a mystery waiting to be unlocked.
Think any of 'em are gonna show?
Cos the party'd be lame ifwe lack for hotties.
Professor?
You with me?
No.
I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers, due at three o'clock.
How are you gonna learn anything ifyou keep doing schoolwork?
Check her out.
Is she hot or is she hot?
She's Buffy.
Buffy?
I like that.
That girl's so hot, she's buffy.
- It's her name, Forrest.
- You've established first contact?
- Excellent!
What do you think of her?
- I never really thought about it.
A girl that cute in the face and you form no opinion?
No, I mean She's all right, I guess.
She's just kinda I don't know.
- Peculiar.
- Peculiar?
Yeah.
Hey, Graham, what do you think of the blonde chick?
Mattressable, n'est-ce pas?
Riley's not down.
He doesn't like her.
I don't dislike her.
She never feels like she's really there when you talk to her.
- I like girls I can get a grip on.
- I'll bet you do.
Not that way.
Just a little less ready for takeoff all the time.
- There's definitely something off about her.
- Maybe she's Canadian.
Didn't she go with Parker Abrams for about 30 seconds?
Yeah, there's a sign of good taste!
OK, but you've got to admit, she's a major-league hottie.
Well, I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes.
I'm just saying Would you really wanna go out with her?
Hell, yes.
I bet a lot of guys would like to get their hands on her.
The Slayer.
Gonna kill you.
Not so tough.
Kill Slayer.
Well, based on Buffy's description, I believe the men that we're after look something like Iike this.
The latest in fall fascism.
I like it.
A bit full in the hips for my taste.
I think we can safely assume they're human.
So, no research needed.
No study?
Damn!
Next thing you'll tell me is I'll have to eatjelly doughnuts or sleep with a supermodel to get things done.
How much can one man give?
Not too much, I'm afraid.
Once again I'd say you and I will not be needed to help Buffy.
- Really?
- Really.
How about this?
We whip out the Ouija board, light a few candles, summon some ancient, unstoppable evil: mayhem.
We show up and kick its ass.
- Wee bit unethical.
- Hello, people.
Hey.
- It's my late-night storm-trooper pal.
- Just for reference.
- But fairly accurate, you'd say?
- That's your man.
Your man, actually.
You are patrolling tonight?
Nope.
I am going to a party tonight.
Hopefully a "no fighting, no biting" kinda deal.
Somebody's gotta find out who these people are.
Giles, I live in a dorm now.
The girls in my hall wanna party, Willow needs cheering up, I'm going to take her.
- How's Will dealin' - With the black hole of despair since Oz left?
She's dealing.
I'm helping.
It's hard, ergo party.
You two can take patrol.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me, I need to go find something slutty to wear tonight.
Don't drink it.
It's drugged.
- And who are you, mate?
- I'm a rat.
I'm a lab rat, just like the others.
They're gonna kill us, you know.
- How are they gonna do that?
- Well, they starve you.
And when you're ready to bite your own arm, they shoot out one ofthose packets.
You drink, and the next thing you're gone.
- And that's when they do the experiments.
- And "they" are?
The government?
Nazis?
A major cosmetics company?
Who cares?
All I know is, one minute I'm running from the Slayer and the next thing I'm here.
The Slayer!
I knew it!
I knew it!
She took apart my crew and led me straight to these guys.
She set me up, too.
I always worried what would happen when that bitch got funding.
She's wised up a bit.
Fine!
I'll take her apart.
I don't care how brilliant she is.
Stupid pen!
- My notes!
- Ballpoints can be tricky.
That's all for today.
Read chapters eight to eleven for tomorrow.
Riley!
I notice you left off a name today in roll call.
Osbourne.
Daniel Osbourne.
Oz.
He's not in this class any more.
I hear he dropped out.
Well, you heard way wrong, then.
He's not gone.
He left temporarily to work out a few things.
I know that sounds lame in its vagueness, but, I assure you, Oz will be back.
Not to my class, he won't.
An educated guess.
You know the rules, you know I hate exceptions, and yet somehow you feel your exception is exceptional.
- But - It is.
To you.
But since I'm neither a freshman nor a narcissist, I have to consider the whole class.
Ifyour friend can't respect my schedule, I think it's best he not come back.
You know, for someone who teaches human behaviour, you might try showing some.
It's not myjob to coddle my students.
You're right.
A human being in pain has nothing to do with yourjob.
- I like her.
- Really?
You don't think she's a little peculiar?
Here we go.
Gear for tonight.
If commando squads are out there, fully loaded, these babies might give us the edge we'll need.
It's a very impressive array.
Where did it all come from?
Requisitioned it.
Back when I was Military Guy.
That was two years ago.
You still 100 per cent?
Are you kidding?
I put the semper in semperfi.
I might not be able to assemble an M-16 blindfolded like I used to or pass weapons drill for the mobile infantry Might as well face it.
Right now I don't have the technical skills to join the Swiss army.
And all those guys ask you to do is uncork a couple of sassy Cabernets.
I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
Fear not.
Hand-to-hand, I'm still the man.
Whoever these guys trained with, - I'm sure they're not ready to deal with - Xander!
Yes, Mom?
I made a nice fruit punch for you and your friend.
Would you boys like some?
Is it raspberry fruit punch?
So she says "You teach human behaviour.
Maybe you oughta show some".
- You're lying.
She says it to Walsh?
- Hope to die.
- Doesn't lack for guts.
Gotta give her that.
- Yeah, but she's nuts.
Come on.
Like you never wanted to tell the professor off.
Hey, Parker!
Forrest.
What's up, man?
What's the scoop on Buffy Summers?
ls she cool?
Buffy?
She's all right, I guess.
Kinda whiny.
- How's that?
- Well, you know, clingy.
I mean, we got a little physical, well Fully physical, and then she's all over me, you know, like we're betrothed or something.
No, but fun was had, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
The word is stamina.
Definitely a bunny in the sack, but later on, well You know the difference between a freshman girl and a toilet seat?
The toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.
- I can't believe I did that.
- Welcome to the club.
Know how much trouble you could get into?
lf Parker reported you - He won't.
He's too embarrassed.
- I hit him.
- What the hell for?
- He was just being so crude.
Please!
You've heard me say much grosser things.
Yeah, most ofthose are about your own mother.
What is it, then?
I just didn't like hearing him talk about Buffy that way.
I think that Well, I guess I like her.
You're kinda like a moron.
So, you knew that I had feelings for her?
- Everybody knows, man.
- "She's peculiar"?
Dead giveaway, buddy.
- I'm always the last to know.
- So what you gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm gonna go see a girl.
Sorry, can't stay.
Got to go see a girl.
- Get the serum!
- Let me out!
- Bit busy right now.
- I know where the exit is.
You spring me, you're free.
You don't, you're dead.
Hurry!
Hurry!
This way!
New plan - we split up.
You go that way.
Come in.
- Riley.
Hi.
- Hi.
Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything really depressing.
What's up?
Right to the point.
OK.
I was thinking of asking out Buffy.
- She's not here.
- I know.
See, I don't know that much about Buffy, but I'm interested in what she likes and, so far, well, the only thing that I know she likes is you.
What do you want me to do?
Just tell me something.
Anything.
Just give me a clue to Here, let me help you with that.
Just something that'll start us talking.
I'm thinking that "How about them Broncos"?
won't really cut it.
OK.
Say that I help and you start a conversation.
It goes great.
You like Buffy, she likes you.
You spend time together, feelings grow deeper.
And one day, without even realising it, you find you're in love.
Time stops and it feels like the whole world's made for you two and you two alone.
Until one ofyou leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow mockery ofthe human condition.
Yep, that's the plan.
I figured it was.
Look, ifyou wanna tell me to go to hell, that's OK.
Maybe this is the last thing you wanna talk about.
I just feel that well, I've never courted anyone like Buffy before.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like Buffy before.
Why should I trust you?
Just sort of hoping you'd think I have an honest face.
I've seen honest faces before.
They usually come attached to liars.
All right.
I guess I'm not gonna win here.
I appreciate you wanting to protect your friend.
I guess she kinda brings that out in people.
She likes cheese.
What?
Well, I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy likes cheese.
That's a start.
She has a stuffed piggy named Mr Gordo, Ioves lce Capades, without the irony, and she's dragging me to this party tonight at Lowell House.
You're going?
That's my house.
I live there.
Well, it'll give you a chance to interact, but don't get fresh.
Fresh?
Don't even know ifwe like each other yet.
Does she ever talk about me?
Like, has she ever said any - Sorry.
- That's discouraging.
Still, I feel like I have a fighting chance, with my new accomplice.
- I'm not your accomplice.
- No, of course not.
- I'm not.
- You're not.
- We're clear?
- We're clear.
- Spike, is that really you?
- It's me, baby.
Your man is - back.
- Bastard!
You dumped me and staked me and hurt me and left me I know, sugar, but you're forgetting one other thing I did.
- I missed you.
- Really?
Just don't ever do that to me again.
Never, my little foam latte.
Your blondie bear is here to stay.
Well, where have you been?
No, wait.
Don't tell me.
I'm just glad you're back.
- And this time it's for good, right?
- For ever and ever, mon petite crème brûlée.
Ooh!
ltalian!
Yeah.
And get used to it.
Big Daddy's home.
We're gonna go wherever you want, do whatever you want, kill whoever you want.
Starting with the Slayer.
And after that it's all you and me, my little mentholated pack of smokes.
Spiky, let's leave the Slayer alone.
You know she'll only slap you around.
And I can do that.
No, see The head, love.
Watch the head.
Watch it!
Every man faces this moment.
Here.
Now.
Watching, waiting for an unseen enemy that has no face.
Nerve endings screaming in silence.
Never knowing which thought might be your last.
Shut up.
Looks cool.
- Look, we could go.
- No, no.
We're here for fun.
Look, some ofthe guys are here already.
I'm gonna grab a soda.
I'll find you guys.
OK.
She's wearing the halter top with sensible shoes.
So mostly dancing, light contact.
Don't push your luck.
Heavy conversation's out ofthe question.
- So what do I do?
- Ask her to dance.
Right.
Dance.
Wait.
No.
- What's the matter?
- I can't dance.
Then talk.
Keep eye contact.
Funny is good, but don't be glib.
And remember, ifyou hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel.
A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.
Have fun!
Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Buffy You do the reading on chapter nine?
Wow.
Some theories, huh?
Cheese?
Fine, let's split up.
I don't care.
Harmony.
- Xander?
- That's close enough.
I'm warning you, I've been highly trained to put this through your heart.
No mercy, no warning.
I can kill you where you stand.
Bring it on, then.
You sissy kicker!
Cut it out!
I'm so gonna bite you!
- OK, stop, stop!
We should stop, OK?
- OK, I will ifyou will.
On the count ofthree.
One, two, three!
Right!
OK.
It's been great catching up.
I'm gonna pick up the tattered shreds of my dignity and go home.
Leaving you with your fire.
My fire?
Yeah, right!
Like I'd listen to the Sex Pistols.
This crap belongs to Spike.
Spike?
Can you believe him?
He comes back with all these big promises.
Not that I believed him, you know.
He could have spent one night, but, no, everything was "Slayer this", "Slayer that".
He probably already killed her.
I'm not taking him back, I just wanna know why it is that men always Ieave.
I can't believe it.
I choked.
You really, really did.
You don't understand.
I'm good at things.
That's what I do.
I work hard, apply myself.
Get it done.
Well, you failed extremely well.
That's a great comfort to me.
You need to relax.
You're not proposing.
You're just making contact, getting a reaction.
Any reaction is OK except projectile vomiting, but what are the chances ofthat?
Are you OK?
This song.
Yeah, it's a tape of some bands from last year's party.
Associations?
Big.
Bad?
AJ.
Thank you.
Now go find Buffy.
- There's no hurry.
I mean, ifyou wanna talk.
- No.
I want you to find Buffy and tell her that I went home and not to worry about me.
Which at least will give you something to say.
Thanks.
You'll do fine.
Willow said to say that she took off.
She's OK.
Kinda blue, but she said not to worry.
Thank you.
- You know, I wanted to ask you somethin'.
- Ask away.
Buffy!
I've been looking all over for you.
We need We need to talk.
Not here.
It's sort of unfinished business.
Business?
Right.
Excuse us.
No problem.
Denied.
It's not like she blew me off.
She just left with another guy, that's all.
We need you downstairs, anyway.
I hate to say it, but they're probably on their way to make crazy, naked sex.
- Is that necessary?
- Look, I'm protecting you, buddy.
I don't wanna see you mooning over some freshman.
- Retinalscan accepted.
- I like her.
I'm on your side here.
I know you are, Graham.
That's what gives me the strength to put up with this comedian.
Dude, a straight tip: I know about girls.
Exactly.
Girls, plural.
I'm talking about one girl.
One girl.
Initiative vocal code match complete.
SpeciaIAgentFinn, Riley.
The problem is, what kind of girl is gonna go out with a guy who's acting all Joe Regular by day and then turns all demon-hunter by night?
- Maybe a peculiar one.
- Thank you, Graham.
Sure, give him the gratitude when I'm the guy sparing you heartbreak.
She's a major babe.
I still say you've got a shot, Rye.
You see, Forrest?
You don't have to be so negative all the time.
Hold up.
Situation?
Gentlemen, suit up.
We have a code red.
Hostile 17 has escaped.
Here's what we know, and it isn't much.
Hostile 17 broke restraints at exactly 2.47pm.
- Big head start.
- Gets bigger when you interrupt me.
It was bagged and tagged locally, so it knows the area.
The creature has every advantage right now.
Fail to recapture it and everything we've worked for - the lnitiative - could end.
- Nobody's failing on my watch.
- Glad to hear it.
Gentlemen, Agent Finn is now in charge ofthis operation.
- I'm counting on you, Riley.
- We start with the basic mobilisation pattern.
Three teams.
Sweep and search, just like practice.
Thorough but fast.
C Team, campus perimeter.
Make sure it can't leave.
Stake it ifyou gotta, but only as a last resort.
B Team, you're going down.
Tunnels, sewers, cemeteries.
Gates and Miller, we take the heart of campus and work out.
All units, maintain radio contact early and often.
Who's got questions?
Move!
What is wrong with him?
Doesn't Spike get that this is my town?
- He's resilient.
- And it's my night off.
He'd pick another night if he knew you were busy with Teutonic Boy Toy.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothin'.
Riley's a doof.
He's not Teutonic.
We have to assume that Spike's main target is you.
Fine.
He's worn out his welcome.
Tonight I kill him.
- You have a plan?
- I am the plan.
If Spike wants me, I go alone.
No arguments.
Lead him away from the popular places and give him what he wants.
Wait, wait!
- Take this.
- A flare gun?
If I find Spike, I'm staking him, not signalling ships at sea.
You get into trouble - OK.
I'll flare.
- And we'll come a-runnin'.
- Do you think Spike'll find her?
- I'm sure of it.
Hello, gorgeous.
- What have we got?
- Civilian, sir.
- Damn!
- She's compromising the area.
- At least she's not making crazy, naked sex.
- Told you.
We gotta clear her outta there.
Fast.
Maybe not.
Just thinking.
Ifyou were Hostile 17, Iiving offthe crap we feed 'em, what would you rather eat than that?
- Use the girl I got a crush on as bait?
- I can tag a hostile at 50 yards.
Denied.
- She'd be safe the entire - I said denied, Agent.
- Did you just pull rank on me?
- Do you have a problem with that?
No, sir.
So, how are we gonna get her outta there?
Riley!
What are you doing here?
Well, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to you after the party.
You left so fast.
You know, with your friend, who's a boy.
Xander?
He's not anyone that I wanna talk about right now.
You know, I don't want you taking this the wrong way.
It's just I need a little alone time now.
Alone.
- Why?
- I need space.
- We're outdoors.
- Emotionally.
I mean, emotionally.
You know, there's plenty of space back in your room.
Why don't I take you?
- You wouldn't believe the weirdos out - Whoa!
OK.
It's a free campus.
Who died and made you John Wayne?
- I'm just trying to help.
- You think I need help?
Believe me, I don't.
Ifyou were a real gentleman, then you would just leave.
You would go far, far away.
Now.
Shoo!
- Are you drunk?
- Yes.
Go and report me.
- I'm taking you home.
- Ever think maybe I'm gonna take you home?
What?
You think that boys can take care ofthemselves and girls need help?
- Yeah.
- That is so Teutonic.
Look, Buffy, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
Well, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
- See ya!
- Gotta go.
- Tell me we're tracking.
- Honing a signal.
- Got it.
Heading west.
- That better be the hostile.
All units converge, all units converge.
Hard target sighted.
Heading: 1-2 alpha niner.
Let's bag it before this gets ugly.
Come in.
Spike!
What do you want?
A spell?
I can do that.
I'll give you a choice.
Now, I'm gonna kill you.
No choice in that.
But I can let you stay dead or bring you back, to be like me.
I'll scream.
Bonus.
I don't understand.
This sort ofthing's never happened to me before.
- Maybe you were nervous.
- I felt all right when I started.
Let's try again.
Damn it!
Maybe you're trying too hard.
- Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
- Not to me it doesn't!
It's me, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
Well, you came looking for Buffy, then settled.
You didn't wanna bite me.
I just happened to be around.
Piffle!
I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into.
It's always, like, "Ooh, you're like a sister to me" or "Oh, you're such a good friend".
Don't be ridiculous.
I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
- Really?
- Thought about it.
When?
Remember last year?
You had on that fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath?
I never would have guessed.
You played the blood lust kinda cool.
I hate being obvious.
All fangy and grrrr!
Takes the mystery out.
- But ifyou could - If I could.
Yeah.
You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
Don't patronise me.
Getting a picture.
Signature's locked.
- What have we got?
- Humans ofthe freshman variety.
Bingo.
Got a cold one.
Thermal output clocking in at exactly - room temperature.
- Vampire.
Call in a standard triangle flanking manoeuvre.
We're goin' in.
I need a lockdown on grid six.
I'm only 126!
You're being too hard on yourself.
Why don't we wait a half an hour and try again?
Or Hey, hey!
Watch it!
No, hold your fire!
It's on me!
My head!
Bag and tag it.
We're gone.
Sir.
Civilian.
Could have turned.
- Leave her.
- We can't neglect quarantine.
Stop her!
- She's contained.
- Contain this!
Take the mask off.
What was that?
Hostile's escaping.
Move!
We gotta stop him.
Abort!
I'm sure you'll understand if I seem far from happy.
- Ifyou read my report - Hostile 17's found an accomplice who's smart, aggressive and somehow escapes description.
- Whoever he was, the guy was big.
- Strong, too.
- Whoever or whatever.
- I'm not interested in guesswork, gentlemen.
Call me old-fashioned.
I like results.
This report reads like a child's riddle book.
Agent Finn, tell me something good.
My implant?
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature without intense neurological pain, can't feed, can't hardly even hit any more.
- We'll bag it.
- Yes, you will.
Dismissed.
Hey.
Hi.
- Listen, sorry about last night.
- No.
No, I was rude.
I just felt like being alone.
Sometimes it's nice to be out by yourself at night.
I hear that.
Gotta be careful, though.
Lot of strange people out there.
Oh, yeah.
How's Willow doing?
OK.
Course, that stupid fraternity prank on our dorm didn't help any.
That's right.
I forgot you guys live in Stevenson.
- You knew that?
- Well, Willow and I were I thought she might be able to help me on a project.
- Really?
That work out for ya?
- Don't know yet.
Last night at the party.
You wanted to tell me something?
Oh, yeah.
Very important stuff.
I don't remember any of it.
But you would have been fascinated, possibly even moved.
Did Willow tell you I like cheese?
You're a little peculiar.
I can live with that.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
I was thinking of asking out Buffy.
I've never courted anyone like Buffy before.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like Buffy before.
Um, Buffy Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Big Bad is back.
And this time The Slayer set me up too.
- Situation?
- Gentlemen, suit up.
We have a code red.
Hostile 17 has escaped.
Fail to recapture it, and everything we've worked for - the lnitiative - could end.
Nobody's failin' on my watch.
- My implant?
- The implant works.
Hostile 17 can'tharm anyliving creature withoutintense neurologicalpain.
- You're a little peculiar.
- I can live with that.
- Looking for me?
- Holy What do you want?
- Look who's home.
- Slayer Go back where you came from.
Things were great before you came.
And they say one person can't make a difference.
Of all the duties of a dean, one ofthe most pleasant is to see a colleague realise a dream.
Ladies, gentlemen, students, I present to you Professor Gerhardt ofthe Anthropology Department.
When I first realised we were outgrowing our cultural centre, I was concerned.
Then I realised it was like seeing one's child grow up and move on to better things.
In this case, a spacious new facility to be built on this site.
Look at him.
Have you ever seen anything so masculine?
- Dean Guerrero, or his wife?
- I think she means Oh.
Very manly.
Not at all Village People.
So much sexier than the outfit from his lastjob.
I miss the free hot dogs on sticks.
I'm imagining having sex with him, right now.
That's why it's appropriate that the groundbreaking for the UC Sunnydale Cultural Partnership Center is taking place so near Thanksgiving.
Because that's what the melting pot is about: contributions from all cultures, making our culture stronger.
- What a load of horse hooey!
- We have a counter point?
Yeah.
Thanksgiving isn't about blending oftwo cultures.
It's about one culture wiping out another.
And then they make animated specials with the maize and the big, big belt buckles.
They don't show you the scene where all the bison die, and then Squanto takes a musket ball in the stomach.
For some ofthat you were channelling your mother?
Well, yeah, sort of.
That's why she doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving or Columbus Day, the destruction ofthe indigenous peoples.
I know it sounds a little overwrought, but really she's right.
Yeah.
I guess I never really thought about it that way.
With Mom at Aunt Arlene's I'm not getting a Thanksgiving.
Maybe it's just as well.
Well, I think that's a shame.
I love a ritual sacrifice.
Not really a one-of-those.
To commemorate a past event, you kill and eat an animal.
It's a ritual sacrifice - with pie.
..
and thus, a symbolic beginning.
What's she doing?
Xander said he was gonna dig.
I want to see Xander dig.
- That part's just ceremonial.
- Well, it bites.
She's not rippling at all.
Oh, look.
There he goes.
Look at him.
Very diggy.
Soon he'll be sweating.
I'm imagining having sex with him again.
Imaginary Xander is quite the machine.
What happened?
Hey, buddy, are you all right?
OK, don't move.
I'm OK!
I'm - I'm OK.
- All right.
We'll get you some help.
Where am I OK?
While they were pulling Xander out, I heard the anthro professors talking about it.
Man, were they excited.
It's the old Sunnydale Mission, which everyone thought was lost.
Huh?
Is there something out there?
Oh.
No.
I'm sorry.
A lost mission.
A hairbrush I can understand.
By the way, I will find that and get it back to you.
- But how do you lose a mission?
- Huge earthquake in 1812.
Everyone just assumed the mission was levelled.
Instead, they built right over it.
It's like what happened in the '30s with that church the Master was in.
Doesn't it make you wonder what else is there?
Right under our feet.
- Mostly, I've found sewers full of demons.
- Oh, right.
- Man, it's crazy out there.
- Post-midterm frenzy.
And the holiday.
Everyone's goin' home.
It looks like a lotta lucky moms are gonna be getting brimming baskets of dirty laundry.
It's so not fair.
I mean, they all get a family holidayjust because they can go home to their families.
It's a turvy-topsy world.
You know what?
I should have my own Thanksgiving.
I can cook the meal, have all you guys over.
It'll be great.
Buffy, earlier you agreed with me about Thanksgiving.
It's a sham.
It's all about death.
It is a sham.
But it's a sham with yams.
It's a yam sham.
- You won'tjokey-rhyme your way out ofthis.
- I know.
But I want it.
It's like Professor Walsh was saying about sense memory.
I smell a roasting turkey and I'm eight years old.
I liked having that to look forward to.
Everything's different now.
Well, I suppose there could be slightyams.
I mean, we could definitely use a little comfort food.
I bet Giles doesn't have any plans.
And Xander always avoids his family gatherings.
We could not invite Anya.
I don't know.
She and Xander seem pretty tight lately.
Grumble, grumble.
Look, Pilgrims aside, isn't that the point of Thanksgiving?
Everybody has a place to go?
Man, I'm beat.
- We'll do one more sweep, then cash it in.
- I gotta pack tonight.
- You got a flight?
- Wednesday night.
Professor Walsh wants me here for the debriefing.
That's a short Thanksgiving.
With the hostile loose, we're lucky to be goin' home at all.
It's neutered.
The implant works great.
He can't hurt any living thing.
As long as he knows about the lnitiative, he's a threat.
We do this the professor's way.
Mama's boy.
That's a nasty cough.
You might need to spend the weekend in quarantine.
Oh, no.
I'm done coughing.
I just don't want anyone gettin' sick.
Xander, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be digging.
I went to watch you digging, and you weren't there doing it.
I'm going now.
Just kinda tough gettin' going today.
Your head is moist.
Oh!
You're sick.
Well, you can't go to work.
- Oh.
Anya - You're pasty and wet and disgusting.
They can dig without you.
I don't really feel that bad.
I inflicted a lot of putrefying diseases on men when I was an avenging demon.
You look like you're getting all ofthem.
OK.
I'll stay.
But you should go.
You could catch it.
Then we'll die together.
It's romantic.
Let me get your trousers off.
You're a strange girlfriend.
I'm a girlfriend?
There's a chance I'm delirious.
Ah, yes.
Well, whatever it is that's making you sick, so far I like it.
It's a very exciting opportunity.
I can't wait to go down there myself.
It's just It means we're gonna have to start looking for a new location.
No, it's really up to the dean.
I just hope this doesn't cost us another year.
OK.
Talk to you later.
I'll never get used to this.
One day she's at the Friendship Ceremony, and the next day, she's on the news.
The coroner's office said she was missing an ear.
So I'm thinking maybe we're looking for a witch.
There are some great spells that work much better with an ear in the mix.
That's one fun little hobby you've got there, Will.
Or maybe an ear-harvesting demon that It's, like, building another demon completely out of ears.
Or Oh.
Thought.
We're just assuming someone else cut offthe ear.
What if it was self-inflicted, like Van Gogh?
So she brutally stabbed herself, dumped the body and then cut off her own ear?
No.
She cut off her ear, then killed herself, then dumped the body I'm really off my game, aren't l?
Yeah.
Wait.
Something's missing from this case.
- Early 1800 Chumash knife.
There's a picture.
- What's it look like?
Pretty darn scary.
It was more like a riot than a Ralphs.
I nearly used slayer moves on a woman who was hoarding the pumpkin pie filling.
And at some point you are going to tell me about the murder?
Oh.
Right.
The knife was some sort of lndian artefact.
- Chumash, I think.
That's all we got.
- Oh, the Chumash lndians.
They were indigenous to this whole area.
That's interesting.
Then, of course, the murder weapon might have just been a convenient choice.
Uh-uh.
There was a big scissors right there.
That knife was picked for a reason.
Do you even own a turkey pan?
Tell me again why we're not doing this at your house.
Giles, ifyou would like to get by in American society, you have to follow our traditions.
You're the patriarch.
You have to host the festivities.
And this is in no way an elaborate scheme to stick me with the cleanup?
How about that ceremonial knife, huh?
Juicy piece of clueage, don't you think?
All right, I'll look into the Chumash connection.
See ifthere's any ritual significance to the ear removal.
Thank you.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I still need to pick up a few things, so I'll check in.
And keep your hands offthe food.
Oh, I'll try and restrain myselffrom eating uncooked potatoes and cranberries.
So, what do you think?
She sounds good.
Kind of intense about this Thanksgiving thing.
I think perhaps she's a little lonely.
But I meant about the murder.
Whatever killed the woman in the museum is probably the danger.
This danger Your friend has some ominous vision about Buffy?
It's all terribly vague.
There are other things happening.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I can'tjust keep watching.
I'm glad you're watching out for her, but she's not helpless, - and it's not yourjob to keep her safe.
- It's not yours any more either.
Are you gonna walk away?
All right.
But I feel we should tell her.
I don't like keeping this secret.
If she knew I was here, it would distract her.
It could get her hurt.
I don't want to get in the way.
I assume there is a connection to the old mission.
Something is angry about being disturbed.
Or it was trapped there and now it's released.
Something with a fondness for ancient weapons?
- You know Father Gabriel?
- No.
He knows the history ofthis place back to mission times.
- He might be able to fill in some blanks.
- OK.
I'll see about contacting him.
- Where are you going?
- To watch her.
It's not fair.
You know that's what she'd say.
You can see her, but she can't see you?
Believe me, I'm not gettin' the good half ofthis deal.
To be on the outside looking in at what I can't No.
I'd forgotten how bad it feels.
But you have whipped cream.
I saw it in Giles's fridge.
But that's whipped cream in a canister.
It's only right ifyou whip it yourself.
Hey, and then later we can churn our own butter and make sweaters out of sheep.
OK.
It's the last thing.
I promise.
Besides, I have to see that priest Giles called about.
- Thinks he might have some information.
- Buffy?
Hey, Buffy.
Riley.
Where did you come from?
I didn't see you at all.
Oh, just across the street.
And a couple of blocks down.
- Hey, Willow.
- Hi.
Well, I'm just gonna let you two Look!
They're selling coffee in the coffee shop.
Yum.
Angel!
Evil - you're all evil again.
I'm not evil.
I'm here to help Buffy.
- What's goin' on?
- My friend had a vision.
Buffy's in danger.
- So tell her.
Help her.
- If she sees me, it'll be worse.
See, I don't get all this "Ieaving for her own good" garbage.
Because that's what it is.
You can'tjust give up because there's obstacles.
- Willow.
- Sorry.
My stuff.
You know how I feel about her.
Ifthere was any way Yeah, I know.
It's just everything's different now.
Hey, is Cordelia really working for you?
Of all the people you could've hired Willow, I'm here to protect Buffy.
I don't have a lot oftime for personal stuff.
Right.
Well, how can I help?
Well, ifyou can just tell me Who's that guy?
It'll be just like when I was a kid.
Only without me building a fort out of mashed potatoes.
- Sounds like fun.
- It will be.
You know, ifyou don't already have plans, you should come.
I'm a great cook - in theory.
I've eaten a lot.
That sounds so great.
But I'm outta here tonight.
I got a last-minute flight to lowa.
Iowa.
That's one ofthe ones in the middle, right?
My folks and I always do Thanksgiving at my grandparents' house.
A farm outside Huxley.
- Sounds nice.
- It is.
After dinner, we all go for a walk down by the river with the dogs.
There's trees and And you're thinking it's like I grew up in a Grant Wood painting.
Exactly - if I knew who that was.
Just a guy who painted stuff that looked like where I grew up.
Well, have fun at the homestead.
Always do.
What's the line?
"Home's the place that, when you have to go there" "..
they have to take you in".
Get out!
- But, babe, this is where I belong.
- Out!
I mean it.
I've been doing a lot of reading, and I'm in control of my own power now, so we're through.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
I do.
I mean it a lot.
See?
I knew you'd end up welcoming me back with open arms.
No.
I'm powerful and I'm beautiful and I don't need you to complete me.
And you're mean.
You had that in our bed?
- Do you know how dangerous that is?
- Let's find out.
- You wouldn't.
- You did it to me, remember?
All right.
All right.
I'll go.
Just What?
Can I have someone to eat?
Father Gabriel?
Father Gabriel?
Father?
Are you out here?
God - You can't stop me.
- You're very wrong about that.
I am vengeance.
I am my people's cry.
They call for Hus, for the avenging spirit to carve outjustice.
They tell you to start an ear collection?
You slaughtered my people.
Now you kill their spirit.
This is a great day for you.
It's clear we're dealing with a spirit of some kind.
It's very common for lndian spirits to change to animal form.
Well, it's plenty uncommon for me to freeze up during a fight.
I had the guy.
I was ready for the takedown and I stopped.
- And "Native American".
- Sorry?
We don't say "Indian".
Oh, right.
Yes, yes.
Always behind on the terms.
Still trying not to refer to you lot as "bloody colonials".
And the thing is, I like my evil like I like my men: evil.
You know?
Straight up, black hat, tied to the train tracks, "my electro-ray will destroy Metropolis" bad.
Not mixed up with guilt and the destruction of an indigenous culture.
This spirit warrior - Hus, you called him - has killed innocent people.
OK, we need to boil those and put them through the ricer.
I don't think I have a ricer.
You don't have a ricer?
What do you mean?
- How could someone not have a ricer?
- Well, do you have one at home?
I don't know.
What's a ricer?
We'll mash them with forks, as the Pilgrims did.
- Did you get the part about innocent people?
- Yes.
OK?
And I do wanna stop him.
I'd just like to find a non-slayey way to do it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Peas?
- Peas.
- These are frozen.
- What's all that?
Atrocities.
I got the full poop on the Chumash lndians and our fabulous buried mission.
- You said you'd get fresh ones.
- Atrocities?
Peas.
They come in pods.
You shell them.
I didn't have time.
I was reading about the Chumash war.
The Chumash were peaceful.
Oh, they were fluffy indigenous kittens, till we came along.
- They'll be mushy.
- They won't be.
I like mushy peas.
You're the reason we had Pilgrims in the first place.
So what happened to the Chumash?
How about imprisonment, forced labour, herded like animals into a mission full of bad European diseases.
Boy.
The Cultural Partnership Center didn't stress any ofthat stuff.
Not even a diorama.
And it gets better.
The few Chumash who tried to rebel were hanged.
And when a group was accused of stealing cattle, they were killed.
Men, women and children.
And for proof to bring back to their accusers They cut offtheir ears?
So Hus wasn't kidding about vengeance.
He's re-creating all the wrongs done to his people.
- Then it's up to us to stop him.
- Yes, but after dinner, right?
Are you sure we shouldn't be helping him?
No, I think perhaps we won't help the angry spirit with his rape and pillage and murder.
Well, OK, no.
But we should be helping him redress his wrongs.
Bring the atrocities to light.
Ifthe history books are full ofthem, they already are.
- Giving his land back.
- It's not exactly ours to give.
I don't think you wanna help.
I think you just wanna slay the demon, then go "La, la, la".
And I think your sympathy for his plight has blinded you to certain urgent facts.
We have to stop this thing.
- OK, Unfeeling Guy.
- Willow, that's not fair.
I have to baste.
Willow, I have reason to believe that Buffy may be in particular danger from this menace.
You mean Angel?
- I saw him too.
- That's not terribly stealthy of him.
I think he's lost his edge.
- But Buffy doesn't know?
- No, no.
Not a peep.
That's good.
But this is why I think we should all keep a level head in this.
I think mine is the level head and yours is the one things would roll off of.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Xander!
- You look like death.
- Are you OK?
You didn't bring rolls?
The doctor couldn't figure it out.
He said I had a lot of symptoms that didn't connect.
I think they do connect.
What, to this Chumash spirit vengeance guy?
Didn't you say the Chumash got all diseased in the mission?
Yeah.
This has a better account.
It lists the various Various?
As in?
Well, the important thing is not to panic.
You just recited the mystical panic-causing incantation, so little hope there.
Let's talk about the various.
Well, they did suffer from malaria, some smallpox - I was gonna say smallpox.
- You know, syphilis - But basically standard - Syphilis?
Well But this is probably mystical, and it'll all go away as soon as As soon as what?
- We still don't know what we're gonna do.
- Maybe I can find something.
Let's give him some land.
That'll clear everything up.
- Sarcasm accomplishes nothing, Giles.
- It's sort of an end in itself.
Can we come rocketing back to the part about me and my new syphilis?
It'll make you blind and insane.
But it won't kill you.
The smallpox will.
Maybe there's a Wiccan spell that can cure it.
Something regular medicine doesn't know about.
Ooh, there was a potion!
Sage, salt onion?
- That's the stuffing.
- Oh, God.
Oh.
You're gonna get vesicles and pustules.
They have pictures.
- I hate this guy.
- He's just doing what was done to him.
- I didn't give him syphilis.
- You freed his spirit.
And after a century of unrest, he saw you as one of his oppressors.
What, so he rises up and infects the first guy he sees?
- That's no fair.
- Like you've never woken up cranky?
Why the others?
Why them particularly?
So we take this guy out.
Buffy, it is for to be slaying sometime soon, yeah?
That's sort ofthe question before the court.
Question?
- There are two sides to it.
- To slaying him?
- Well, the member from Syphilis votes yea.
- It's not that simple.
He's a vengeance demon.
You don't talk to vengeance demons.
You kill them.
- I didn't know you felt that way.
- What?
Anyway, he's a spirit, not a demon.
And we've never faced this sort of spirit before.
We don't know what will kill it.
- Again with the killing.
- Figuratively speaking.
Or bind it.
Whatever.
Willow, we all appreciate your perspective.
- Sometimes vengeance is justified.
- You know I didn't mean you.
No one appreciates the truth ofthe situation.
I think we do.
This is no good!
It needs more condensed milk.
Buffy, Xander is in danger.
Are you sure the solution is pie?
- Over bickering, I'll take pie.
- We will find a solution.
And we will have a nice dinner, OK?
Both.
End of story.
I'm going to have Thanksgiving, and it'll be perfect.
Hus won't stop.
Vengeance is never sated, Buffy.
Hatred is a cycle.
All he will do is kill.
Help me.
What part of "help me" do you not understand?
The part where I help you.
Come on.
I'm parboiling out here.
- Want me to help make it quicker?
- Invite me in.
- No.
- Very unlikely.
Damn it!
Look, I'm safe.
I can't bite anyone.
Willow, tell 'em what I did.
You said you were gonna kill me, then Buffy.
Yes, bad, but let's skip to the part where I couldn't bite you.
It's true.
- He had trouble performing.
- Yeah.
It looks like they've done me for good.
What are you saying?
Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more.
I can't bite anything.
I can't even hit people.
So you haven't murdered anybody lately?
Let's be best pals.
I've got information - about the soldier boys you were fighting.
I've got the inside scoop.
Come on.
What have you got to be afraid of?
First People, who dwell in Mishupashup, hear me and descend.
Walk with me upon ltiashup again.
Hear me also, Nunashush, spirits from below, creatures ofthe night.
Take human form and join the battle.
Bring me my revenge.
Bloody hell, woman!
You're cuttin' off my circulation.
- You don't have any circulation.
- Well, it pinches.
- Get over it.
I have more important worries.
- I came to you in friendship.
Well, all right, seething hatred.
But I've got useful information and I'm being mistreated.
So tell me everything you know.
- I'm too hungry to remember everything.
- Then sit.
- How much butter goes in with these?
- Half a stick, and a quarter cup of brandy.
You do have brandy, don't you?
What?
Oh.
Yes.
On the bookcase.
- I wouldn't say no to a brandy.
- What's wrong?
The victims.
Apart from Xander, Hus has targeted authority figures.
Father Gabriel, the curator ofthe cultural centre - Who else fits?
- Just a small brandy.
Dean Guerrero.
He's the king of us, and he was at the ceremony.
A likely candidate.
We should warn him.
Will, anything in those books about how to stop a Native American spirit guy?
Some nice, nonjudgmental way to, you know, kill him?
I'm not gonna help you kill him.
I'm not on board.
Will, what choice do we have?
Buffy, this isn't a Western.
We're not at Fort Giles with the cavalry coming to save us.
It's one lonely guy.
Oppressed warrior guy, who's just trying to - Kill a lot of people?
- Well, I didn't say he was right.
Will, you know how bad I feel about this.
It's eating me up.
A quarter cup and simmer.
But even though it's hard, we have to end this.
Yes, he's been wronged, and I personally would apologise Oh, someone put a stake in me.
You got a lot of volunteers in here.
I just can't take all this mamby-pamby boohooing about the bloody lndians.
- The preferred term - You won.
All right?
You came in, killed them and took their land.
That's what conquering nations do.
Caesar did, and he didn't say "I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it".
History is not people making friends.
You had better weapons and you massacred them.
End of story.
Well, I think the Spaniards actually did a lot of Not that I don't like Spaniards.
Listen to you.
How are you gonna fight anyone with that attitude?
- We don't wanna fight anyone.
- I just wanna have Thanksgiving.
Yeah.
Good luck.
- Ifwe could talk to him - You exterminated his race.
What could you possibly say that would make him feel better?
It's kill or be killed here.
Take your bloody pick.
Maybe it's the syphilis talkin', but some ofthat made sense.
I made these points earlier, but it's fine.
No one listens to me.
Fine, OK.
But someone still has to go warn the dean.
- I'll go.
I need the air.
- Not alone.
- I'll go.
- Me too.
- You sure you're up to it?
- Oh, leave that one.
He looks like he's ready to drop, and I think I can eat someone if he's already dead.
- I'm up to it.
- I'll keep on looking for a solution.
Yeah.
Guys, the dean's house is up past the gym.
And hurry!
Dinner's in an hour.
- Hey.
When do I get fed?
- Later.
I hope the others are OK.
Do you know what happens to vampires who don't get to feed?
- I wondered that.
- Giles, plates.
Living skeletons, mate.
Like famine pictures from those dusty countries.
Only not half as funny.
- You can have gravy.
That has blood in it.
- Do you know what else has blood in it?
Blood.
Do I have to gag you?
Because I won't listen to you whine all through my dinner.
It'll be a nice, quiet, civilised You!
Listen, maybe I wasn't clear about how terrible we all feel.
We're trying to help.
- What's goin' on?
- It isn't working.
You can have casinos now.
Get down!
What about me?
You gonna leave me here like this?
Hey!
Watch the heart.
- That was a waste oftime.
- I think he thought we were crazy.
IfAnya hadn't opened the conversation with "Everybody got both ears"?
I liked his wife.
She gave me pie.
- So what do we do now?
- We could stay here and stand watch, or Willow.
Angel?
So this is Angel.
He's large and glowery, isn't he?
- He's evil again.
- I'm not.
Why does everyone think that?
- Angel's here to protect Buffy.
- I haven't been evil for a long time.
She's not supposed to know he's here.
Angel, any news?
The Chumash weapons are missing from the centre.
Where's Buffy?
At Giles'.
She sent us to check on Dean Guerrero.
- Why the Dean?
- He may go after someone in charge.
- A leader?
- He's a warrior.
To a warrior, the leader means the strongest fighter.
- Buffy.
- He's formed a raiding party.
- We gotta get over there.
- I'll call her.
Get back fast.
Here.
You guys can ride.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, we're well aware ofthat.
We're under siege now, actually.
Thank you.
- Who was that?
- A Someone.
We need a plan.
Yes.
Let's talk about it some more.
- Where's your weapons chest?
- Over there.
Buffy!
Remember that conquering nation thing?
Apologise.
- Shut up, Spike.
- Fine.
I'll do it myself.
Hey, sorry.
Sorry about that, chief.
How many?
The leader, upstairs.
Two by the living-room windows.
One through the window by the door.
- There's too many.
- We need help.
OK.
One, two, three.
Stop them!
Enough!
Ow!
Bloody hell!
- Giles, these guys, they don't die.
- Bit busy over here.
Why won't you die?
What's he like when he is evil?
Help the others.
Your knife can kill you.
A bear!
You made a bear.
- I didn't mean to.
- Undo it!
Undo it!
Hey, Gentle Ben!
Over here!
That's for giving me syphilis.
What happened?
Did we win?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I can'tbite.
I can't even hitpeople.
Previously on "Buffy the Vamlpire Slayer": I've got information.
About the soldiers you were fighting.
- I'm going.
- Well, how long?
I don'tknow.
The wolfis inside me all the time.
Untillfigure out what thatmeans, lshouldn'tbe aroundyou.
- Yeah.
That looks good.
- I think it's not straight.
- One second.
Almost finished.
- Oh, right.
OK.
- Yeah, just unhook it.
- Then let me flip it over.
Thanks, Riley.
Looks good.
Hey, Buffy.
- Is there something you wanna tell me?
- What?
Yes.
I am a lesbian.
Well, it's good you're so open about it.
Oh, hey.
You know we were talking about having a picnic?
I was thinking, do you ever hang out at Ruggs' field?
It's beautiful there.
Usually not that crowded, either.
I thought we could have a little spread - sandwiches, maybe some ants?
It'd be fun.
We were talking about having a picnic?
So was that a conversation I actually had, or one I was just practising?
Practising?
OK, yes.
I have been known to do a little prep work before our conversations.
It's not easy, you know, talking to you sometimes.
It's like an oral exam.
Boy.
That's just what every girl longs to hear.
- Well, you're tricky.
- Like an exam?
I never know how you're gonna react to something.
That's why I like you so much.
You're a mystery.
Probably every beautiful girl has some jerk telling her she's a mystery, but, I swear, you really are.
There's a lot about you that needs puzzling out.
I lose you somewhere?
Right around "beautiful".
Say, don't you just love a picnic?
It's just different, you know?
A picnic.
First of all, daylight.
It's kind of a new venue, Buuffywise.
And the best part?
He said he would bring all the food, so all I have to do is show up and eat.
Those are two things I'm really good at.
- So he's nice?
- Very, very.
And there's sparkage?
Yeah.
He's Have you seen his arms?
Those are good arms to have.
I really like him.
I do.
But?
I don't know.
I really like being around him, you know?
And I think he cares about me.
But I just feel like something's missing.
He's not making you miserable?
Exactly.
Riley seems so solid.
Like he wouldn't cause me heartache.
Get out.
Get out while there's still time.
I know.
I have to get away from that bad-boy thing.
There's no good there.
Seeing Angel in LA, even for five minutes Hello to the pain.
The pain is not a friend.
But I can't help thinking, isn't that where the fire comes from?
Can a nice, safe relationship be that intense?
I know it's nuts, but part of me believes that real love and passion have to go hand in hand with pain and fighting.
I wonder where I get that from.
So, you saw their faces but you can't describe them.
Well, they were human.
Two eyes each, kind of in the middle.
Uh-huh.
And the lab?
Underground.
I came out through an air vent.
I don't know exactly where.
I'm done.
Put the telly on.
It's about time.
Hope you got it warm enough.
I don't know why you're so dainty suddenly.
You've done this for Angel.
You must have.
- OK.
- Give it.
That's it.
The invalid-amnesiac routine is over.
The kitchen is closed until you tell me something useful.
I'm trying to remember.
It was very traumatic.
- How long are you gonna pull this crap?
- How long will I live if I tell you?
Spike, we have no intention of killing a harmless creature, but we have to know what's been done to you.
We can't let you go until we're sure you're impotent, or - Sorry.
Until we know that you're - Flaccid?
- You are one step away, missy.
- Giles, help.
He's gonna scold me.
You know what?
I don't think you want us to let you go.
- Maybe we made it a little too comfy for ya.
- Comfy?
I'm chained in a bathtub drinking pig's blood from a novelty mug.
- Doesn't rate huge in the Zagat's guide.
- You want something nicer?
Look at my poor neck, all bare and tender and exposed.
All that blood just pumping away.
- Oh, please.
- Giles, make her stop.
Ifthose two don't kill each other, I might lend a hand.
What about a truth spell?
I'm not positive it would work on a vampire, but we could try.
Make him 'fess up?
A truth spell, of course.
Why didn't I think ofthat?
Cos you had your hands full with the undead English patient?
- Yes, worth a go.
- Looks pretty simple.
- I'll stop by the magic shop tomorrow.
- Excellent.
All right.
I'll be back in the morning with doughnuts and motherwort.
- Bye, Buffy.
I'll see you at home.
- Bye.
Great.
Thank you, Willow.
Willow may have had a very helpful idea.
She seems to be coping better with Oz's departure, don't you think?
She still has a way to go, but, yeah, I think she's dealing.
What, are you people blind?
She's hanging on by a thread.
Any ninny could see that.
Devon said thathe sentforhis stuff.
I guess this means he's planning on settling down somewhere else.
Not here.
I guess so.
I feel like I've been split down the centre and half of me is lost.
I know.
It feels like that now.
Oz is gone.
Come on, now.
It's telly time.
This is Buffyand Willow.
Please leave a message.
Willow, it's Giles.
I thought you were bringing the ingredients for that spell?
- I really have to - Passions is on.
Timmy's down the bloody well.
- And ifyou make me miss it, I'll - You'll do what?
Lick me to death?
Look, Willow, I think we ought to try the spell.
Among other things, I'd like to shower sometime today.
Alone.
- Driving?
- Yeah.
You seriously drive for fun?
Well, not four-wheeling or anything, but yeah.
Don't you?
Actually, no-wheeling is more my specialty.
I'm an avid pedestrian, though.
You're kidding, right?
I mean, you know how to drive?
Well, I took the class.
Cars and Buffy are, like, un-mixy things.
You just haven't had a good experience yet.
You can have the best time in a car.
It's not about getting somewhere.
You have to take your time.
Forget about everything.
Just relax.
Let it wash over you.
The air, the motion.
Just let it roll.
We are talking about driving, right?
I thought I was.
I'm taking you.
Some night when it's warm.
Up past the vineyards.
- It's gonna change everything for you.
- I'm in.
Hey, Willow.
- Hey.
- I interrupted.
You've got apples.
My miss.
Wait.
Sit.
There's plenty to go around.
- Did something happen?
Something wrong?
- No.
Everything's fine.
The same.
Your apples are turning brown, the way they do.
Yeah, I guess they do that.
Yeah.
Yeah Jeez.
You mean Oz just sent for his stuff and didn't even call her?
That's pretty harsh.
I wish I had my powers back.
I'd liquefy his entrails for her.
That's sweet.
God, poor Will.
No wonder she's having a wonderful time.
Wow.
Way to rebound.
I believe that's the dance of a Brave Little Toaster.
Hey, guys, come on.
This music's great.
Nice to see you brought your boogie shoes, Will.
Yeah.
You know, I know I've been sort of a party poop lately.
So I said to myself "Self," I said, "it's time to shake and shimmy it off".
- Sounds like a good policy.
- Yeah.
And it works, too.
You know, I just figure, in the grand scheme ofthings, we're all just Drunk?
"Drunk" I mean, that's such a strong word.
Kind of a guttural, Anglo-Saxon word.
"Drunk".
Will, not loving the drowning ofthe sorrows.
Not drowning, wading.
And see?
Lite.
No big.
No big?
Remember when Buffy had the fun beerfest and went One Million Years BC?
- Sadly, without the fuzzy bikini.
- Offtopic, Xander.
Right.
Helping now.
Will, how about you give me that beer?
No.
Why should l?
- I've got pain here.
Big-time, legitimate pain.
- We all have pain, Will.
Like what?
"Oh, poor me.
I live in a basement".
Yeah, that's dire.
- OK, that's it.
I'm taking you home.
- No, I don't want to.
Well, you'll thank me when you still have a friend in the morning.
I just can't stand feeling this way.
I want it to be over.
It will.
I promise.
But it's gonna take time.
- Well, that's not good enough.
- I know.
It's just how it is.
You have to go through the pain.
Well, isn't there some way I can just make it go away, just cos I say so?
Can't I just make it go poof?
Hearken well, ye elements.
I summon thee now.
Control the outside.
Control within.
Land and sea, fire and wind.
Out of my passions, a web be spun.
From this eve forth, my will be done.
So mote it be.
It is my will that my heart be healed.
Now.
I will that this book speak its words to me.
I will that this Q-Tip gets unbendy?
Come in.
Giles.
What are you doing here?
I'm a bit concerned about you, actually.
- Did Buffy tell you about the beer?
- Buffy didn't tell me anything.
Well, forget the beer part, then.
Happily.
I came because we had an appointment the other day.
- Right, right.
The truth spell.
- Yes.
Willow, I know that you're going through a very difficult time.
- But shirking your responsibilities - But I didn't shirk.
I I did the research and l I picked up the motherwort.
I just forgot the doing-the-spell part.
- That isn't like you at all.
- I know.
I've been off.
I even tried to do a spell last night.
To have my will done?
I was hoping it would make me feel better, but itjust went kablooey.
A spell?
It's not wise for you to do that alone right now.
Your energy's too unfocused.
Well, that's not true.
I said I was off, not incompetent.
You're grieving, so it might be wise to take a break from doing spells without supervision.
So I get punished cos I'm in pain?
- It's not punishment.
I'm saying it because - You care.
Yeah.
Everybody cares.
Nobody wants to be inconvenienced.
You all want me to take the time and go through the pain, - as long as you don't have to hear about it.
- Now that's not fair.
Isn't it?
Cos I'm doing the best I can, and it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.
- And I see how you could feel that way.
I do - No, you don't.
You say that you do, but you don't see anything.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Perhaps I'd better be going.
Let's Iet's talk about this later.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
"Enemy, enemy, be now quiet".
You know, not too keen about this spell stuff.
Tends to be a bit unpredictable.
Yes.
You might have thought about that sooner.
"Let your deceitful tongue be be broken".
"Let no untruths be spoken".
Hey, what's that all about?
Oh, nothing.
Just, you know, ash in my eye.
Well, I won't have you doing mojo on me ifyou can't read properly.
You could turn me into a stink beetle or whatall.
It would be a generous ending for you, Spike.
I mean, I'm going through something.
I just don't see why he was getting down on me.
Giles just worries.
Spells can be dangerous.
It doesn't mean he thinks you're a bad witch.
- I am a bad witch.
- No, you're a good witch.
I'm not kidding anyone.
If I had any real power, I could've made Oz stay with me.
- You wouldn't have wanted him to stay - I didn't dare to do the spell on Veruca.
And my "I will it so" spell went nowhere.
The only real witch here is fuzzy little Amy.
- I think you're being too hard on yourself.
- She has powers I can't even invoke.
I mean, first she's a perfectly normal girl, then poof, she's a rat.
I could never do something like that.
Hello?
I'll be right there.
- Spike escaped.
- And you're going?
Now?
Sorry, duty thing.
Well, I mean, what's the rush?
Spike can't hurt anyone, right?
And I figured, since I'm kinda grievey, we could, you know, have a girl's night.
Eat sundaes and watch SteeIMagnolias, and you can tell me at least I don't have diabetes.
I can't hang out with you until I get Spike back to Giles, you know that.
OK, I'll be back as soon as I can.
I promise.
I don't see the big.
He's probablyjust standing out there.
You'll find him in two seconds.
- Thought that was gonna take longer.
- Me, too.
Must have got turned around.
Hang on, this This is it.
Wait No.
Yes.
- What are you talking about?
- The lab.
Commando lab.
- The door was right here where I escaped.
- I don't think so.
Open up.
I'm gonna kill you.
- Spike, there's nothing there.
- Let me in.
- Fix me.
- OK, drop the act.
- Get off.
- OK, that's it, I'm gonna gag you.
Watch it.
- One more word out ofyou, and I swear - Swear what?
You won't do anything to me.
You don't have the stones.
I got the stones.
I got a whole bunch of stones.
Yeah?
You're all talk.
Giles.
I accidentally killed Spike.
That's OK, right?
Just a minute.
I mean, I'm going through something.
You'd think, every once in a while, Buffy would make best friends a priority.
Will, it's not like she could just let Spike go.
I get this spell reversed, they'll be finding your body for weeks.
Make a move.
Please.
I'm dying for a good slay.
Spike's more important than me.
I get it.
Buffy's gotta find out about those commandos.
Right now she needs Spike.
Well, fine.
Why doesn't she just go marry him?
Ifthe two ofyou could remain civil long enough to It's just so sudden.
I don't know what to say.
Just say yes, and make me the happiest man on earth.
Oh, Spike.
Of course it's yes.
Giles.
You'll never believe what's happened.
- It's just not fair.
- Will, I know it's hard to see it right now, but everything you feel is because of Oz.
Not because of Buffy and me or anybody.
But you'll meet somebody else, and it'll be better.
Yeah.
Cos most relationships are great and trouble-free.
I don't think so.
I think we're all doomed to badness.
- We're not doomed.
- Oh, yeah?
Let's look at your bio.
Insect Lady, Mummy Girl, Anya.
You're a demon magnet.
I was just trying to help.
Willow, it's me.
Something's happened.
I need your help.
I can't see very well.
Everything's blurred.
I'm certain it's a spell of some kind, because, well, it seems something else is going wrong.
Here you go.
98.6.
Horribly wrong.
There's so much to decide.
Ceremony, guests, reception.
Well, first thing I'd say, we're not having a church wedding.
How about a daytime ceremony in the park?
Fabulous.
Enjoy your honeymoon with the Big Pile of Dust.
Under the trees.
Indirect sunlight only.
A spring breeze tosses the leaves aside, and again, you're registering as Mr and Mrs Big Pile of Dust.
Stop it.
This is our wedding and you're treating it like a big joke.
Pouty.
Look at that lip.
Gonna get it.
Gonna get it.
Stop.
Yes, please stop.
- Giles, did you see my ring?
- Thankfully, not very well.
I'm not crazy, and I know that you probably don't approve.
And my father's not that far away.
I mean, he could But this day is about family, my real family.
And I would like you to be the one to give me away.
Buffy.
That's that's so For God's sake.
This is nonsense.
Something is making you act this way.
Don't you realise what you're doing?
Living the dream.
He's gonna have to take time to get used to it, pet.
They all will.
But you guys weren't crazy about Angel at first.
You weren't gonna say that name.
Sorry.
Why don't we talk about where we're gonna register?
Where would Angel register?
Can we have the photographer Angel would want?
And flowers Angel would have liked?
You think I don't live with the shadow of Drusilla over my head?
That I'm not wondering ifyou're gonna be thinking of her on our honeymoon when you're making sweet love to me?
Giles, are you OK?
I rather think not.
I seem to be rather rather blind.
Completely, in fact.
What?
How could this happen?
- A spell, I believe.
- Well, we'll fix it.
Don't worry.
What you want is a general reversal spell.
We're gonna need supplies.
Are you helping me?
Well, it's almost like you're my father-in-law, ain't it?
See?
This is how it's gonna be.
Spike'll even take care ofyou while I'm at the magic shop.
From now on, we're a family.
It's all right.
I have more Scotch.
Hey, Buffy.
- What's up?
- Riley, look.
Aren't they beautiful?
Yeah, they're nice.
A little dressy maybe, for school, but - Riley.
- Buffy?
I really like you.
I hope you know that you mean a lot to me, and ifthings were different Different than what?
I want you to promise me that we can always be friends.
And I'd really like you to be there on the day.
- The day when - The wedding.
- The wedding.
What wedding?
- My wedding.
I'm getting married.
Can you believe it?
- I don't think no is a strong enough word.
- I know.
It's crazy.
I mean, we fought for all these years and then Sometimes you just look at someone - and you know, you know?
- No.
I think maybe we fought because we couldn't admit how we really felt about each other.
- Can we start again?
- You'll really like him.
- Well, nobody really likes him.
- I need to clear a few things up.
- I don't even really like him.
- Buffy.
But I love him.
I do.
- Who?
- What?
- What's his name?
- Who?
- The groom.
- Spike.
- That's a name?
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.
- No, you are mad.
No, I am.
I really Wow.
Who is this guy?
Does he go here?
- Spike?
Oh, no, he's totally old.
- Old.
- Well, not as old as my last boyfriend was.
- OK.
It's late, and I'm I'm very tired now, so I'm just gonna go far away and be away.
- But - No.
Stay.
You're ruining my happy day.
That's OK, Mom.
We don't need any more snacks.
- I liked those Fruit Roll-Ups.
- I thought she'd never clear out.
Besides, just think of my lips as the Fruit Roll-Ups of love.
OK, that was gross.
I'm a little distracted.
Willow was really upset.
I shouldn't have let her go away mad.
- Regaining focus.
- We just got rid ofyour mom.
Let's not bring Willow into this.
It's time forjust the two of us.
No, no, it's the Pargo demon.
Drowning is the only way to kill it.
What the hell is going on?
So the plan is to cure my total, incapacitating blindness tomorrow, is it?
They were out oftagis root at the magic shop.
They'll have more tomorrow.
I'm on top of it.
- Aren't they a perfect little us?
- I don't like him.
He's insipid.
Clearly human.
Red paint.
We could smear a little on the mouth?
The blood ofthe innocent.
That's my girl.
Stop that right now.
I can hear the smacking.
Honey, we need to talk about the invitations.
Now, do you wanna be "William the Bloody" orjust "Spike"?
Cos either way, it's gonna look majorly weird.
Whereas the name Buffy gives it that touch of classic elegance.
- What's wrong with Buffy?
- Such a good question.
- It's a terrible name.
- My mother gave me that name.
- Your mother.
Yeah, she's a genius.
- Don't you start in on my mother.
Board up the windows and barricade the doors.
- What's going on?
- Demons.
They keep coming and coming.
I think we lost them, but I couldn't see.
Spike.
He's all untied.
Which you probably noticed.
Calm down.
Ifyou lost them, that'll give us time to figure this out.
Maybe the demons have something to do with Giles being blind.
Giles is blind?
Stop whatever you're doing.
You smell like Fruit Roll-Ups.
This is the crack team that foils my every plan?
I am deeply shamed.
Spike's right.
We really should get organised.
Why are you holding hands?
They have to hear it sooner or later.
Spike and I are getting married.
How?
What?
- How?
- Three excellent questions.
What are you looking at?
The man I love.
Can I be blind, too?
Wait.
"Married" I know something.
What is it?
Everything's so familiar.
Work, brain, work.
Willow.
What about Willow?
Honey, get off.
Something about Willow and her griefy, "poor me" mood swings.
So, so tired of it.
I don't have to be nice about her any more?
We're all tired of it, but what does it matter?
She told me I was a demon magnet and you two should get married.
- And that I didn't see anything.
- She did a spell.
Yes.
To have her will done.
Whatever she says is coming true.
You both were affected.
I probably only escaped because I'm the Slayer.
Some kind of natural immunity.
Right.
You're marrying Spike because you're so right for each other.
- Xander.
- That's it.
You're offthe usher list.
Willow is out there.
She probably doesn't know what she's doing.
- We gotta find her.
- Before somebody gets really hurt.
- Why does he have to come?
- Spike will be my husband.
I want him here.
I agree with Xander.
It's work for people who aren't us.
Spike, these are my friends.
Besides, it's myjob.
- For now.
- What?
You want me to stop working?
Do I want you to give up killing my friends?
I've given it some thought.
- This was burned.
- D'Hoffryn.
- Bastard.
He's opened a portal here.
- Who?
Fluffy.
Wear this to the rehearsal dinner and the whole thing's off.
Shut up, honey.
D'Hoffryn.
He made me a demon 1120 years ago.
- Why would he attack Willow?
- I don't believe he did.
You have much anger and pain.
Your magic is strong, but your pain, it's like a scream that pierces dimensional walls.
We heard your call.
I'm sorry.
I'll try for a quiet rage.
Bye.
Our intention is not to quash your potential.
Quite the contrary.
I'd been dumped, I was miserable, doing a few vengeance spells.
- Boils on the penis, nothing fancy.
- Please skip ahead.
D'Hoffryn got wind of me.
He offered to elevate me.
- Meaning?
- They made me a demon.
Oh, God.
Willow.
But you can summon him from his crypt and make him stop?
- Isn't this a perfect place for pictures?
- I'm not posing for chuff all.
Demon.
OK, listen.
Now we're gonna do this without destroying the foliage.
Let's go.
Spike.
Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn.
Let this space be now a gateway to the world ofArashmahar, where demons respond.
The pain and suffering you brought upon those you love has been inspired.
You are ready to join us here in Arashmahar.
Pain?
What pain?
- Buffy.
- Not doing well here.
We come in supplication.
We bend as the reed in the flow of No, wait.
We come in the flow of Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn.
They're strong and I can't fight.
Ifthey get in, I don't know if I can protect you.
- You think you have to protect me?
- Not with the Girl Power bit.
Oh, God.
But I didn't mean to.
But you did.
This is the result ofyour power.
You will make a fine vengeance demon.
No, please.
You have to help them.
It is not my concern.
You are my interest in this matter.
Really, no offence intended I mean, you've been super-nice and everything, but I don't wanna be a demon.
I just wanna go back and help my friends.
- That is your answer?
- It is.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, well.
Here is my talisman.
You change your mind, give us a chant.
Honey.
Spike, are you OK?
Slayer.
A little help here.
Let the healing power begin.
Let my will be safe again.
As these words of peace are spoken, let this harmful spell be broken.
Bloody hell.
Spike lips.
Lips of Spike.
Hi, guys.
How long are you going to keep making these?
Until I don't feel so horribly guilty.
I figure, about a million chips from now.
Also, I have to detail Giles's car.
Time.
- Five past two.
Clear as day.
- Look, cookies.
A very not-evil thing I did.
Oatmeal?
Yes, very funny.
They're chocolate chip.
I can see them.
I still need my glasses, though.
You could be more specific and give me 20/20.
Eat a cookie, ease my pain?
Better?
Well, baking lifts about 30 per cent of my guilt, but only 7 per cent of my inner turmoil.
- Guess that'll just take a while.
- It'll happen.
- Don't I get a cookie?
- No.
Well, I gotta have something.
- I still have Buffy taste in my mouth.
- You're a pig, Spike.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not the one who wanted "Wind Beneath My Wings" for the first dance.
That was the spell.
Did I mention about the sorry part?
We may be into a forgetting spell later.
I loved him.
We were betrothed.
Well, at least you were getting along.
But we weren't.
It wasn't even nice.
And the bad-boy thing?
Over it.
OK, I totally get it.
I'd be really happy to be in a nice relationship with a decent, reliable - Oh, my God.
Riley thinks I'm engaged.
- What?
Riley.
He saw me.
What the hell am I gonna say to him?
- You thought I was serious?
- Well, no - You weren't serious?
- Oh, God, please.
- I'm marrying a guy named Spike?
- Maybe.
We haven't known each other that long.
No, I saw that fear in your eyes when you caught me looking at wedding dresses.
- I had to give you a hard time.
- I did not have fear in my eyes.
Yes, you did.
You were looking at me like I was a cartoon ball and chain.
So you decided to tell me you were getting married?
So you're insane?
But you're still single?
Yes.
OK, then.
Just another little piece ofthe Buffy puzzle.
You really have a lot to learn about women, Riley.
You're gonna teach me.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
So this is what it is.
We're talking about communication.
We're talking about language.
Not the same thing.
It's about inspiration.
Not the idea, but the moment before the idea when it's total.
When it blossoms in your mind and connects to everything.
It's about the thoughts and experiences that we don't have a word for.
A demonstration.
Buffy Summers.
Come on down to the front here.
A typical college girl, one assumes.
Lie down on my desk.
- What?
- Go ahead, you're perfectly safe.
Riley, ifyou could oblige.
- A demonstration, right?
- Be a good boy.
This feels very strange.
Don't worry.
If I kiss you, it'll make the sun go down.
See?
Fortune favours the brave.
Do you hear that?
Can't even shout, can't even cry The Gentlemen are coming by Looking in windows, knocking on doors They need to take seven and they might take yours Can't call to Mom, can't say a word You're gonna die screaming but you won't be heard So I'll see you all Monday for a final review session.
Man, that was an exciting class, huh?
- Oh, yeah, well - And the last 20 minutes was a revelation.
Just laid out everything we need to know for the final.
- I'd hate to have missed that.
- Just tell me I didn't snore.
- Very discreet.
Minimal drool.
- Oh, yay.
- So were you dreaming?
- Yeah.
And it was kind of intense.
Intense?
Really?
Cos you seemed so peaceful.
- Of course, it was only for a moment.
- Right.
You guys headed over toward Judd?
- Student centre.
- Oh, great.
So this dream You know, you guys go.
I'm gonna do the thing.
- So I'll see you after Wicca group.
- OK.
Bye.
Bye.
So tell me about your dream.
As a psych major, I'm qualified to go "hm".
I don't really remember it.
Well, did I appear at all in this dream?
- There might have been a cameo.
- Is that right?
Maybe more like a featured role.
- Romantically?
- I'm not saying a word.
- So what have you got goin' on tonight?
- Patrolling.
- Patrolling?
- Petroleum.
Petroleum?
Tonight you have crude oil?
And homework.
What about you?
You know, grading papers.
- That'll be fun.
- Not petroleum fun, but it passes the time.
- So l - Yeah.
I guess I won't see you until Yeah.
- What papers?
- Papers?
Grading what papers?
We only have the final.
Yeah No, l Late papers I gotta look at.
OK.
Neat.
- So - Class.
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah.
Fortune favours the brave.
"Can't even shout, can't even cry.
The Gentlemen are coming by".
It sounds vaguely familiar.
You're sure it's nothing you heard when you were a child?
All right.
Nothing else?
Well, it could definitely be one ofyour prophetic dreams, or it could just be the eternal mystery that is your brain.
I'll check it out and I'll let you know if I find something.
All right.
Bye-bye.
- You heard of a group called the Gentlemen?
- Group ofwhat?
- The Gentlemen.
- Don't know.
- You certain?
- No.
We're out ofWeetabix.
We are out ofWeetabix because you ate it all.
- Again.
- Get some more.
I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.
Yeah, well, sometimes I like to crumble up the Weetabix in the blood.
Gives it a little texture.
Since the picture you just painted means that I will never touch food of any kind again, - you'll just have to pick it up yourself.
- Sissy.
- Where is this coming from?
- What am I supposed to think?
- How could you say I'm using you?
- You don't care about what I think.
- You don't ask about my day.
- You did turn into a real girl.
See?
And you make jokes during my pain.
You don't care about me at all.
- I care about you.
- How much?
- What do I mean to you?
- I We, you know, we spend We'll talk about it later.
- I think we should talk about it now.
- Thank you for knocking.
- Ifyou don't know how I feel about - I don't.
This isn't a relationship.
You don't need me.
All you care about is lots of orgasms.
OK.
Remember how we talked about private conversations?
How they're less private in front of my friends?
- We're not your friends.
Go on.
- Please don't.
- This is important.
- But why is it here?
Mom said you wanted me to swing by.
Oh, yes.
Well, I meant after sunset.
I need you to take Spike for a few days.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- I'm not staying with him.
I've a friend who's coming to town, and I'd like us to be alone.
You mean an orgasm friend?
Yes, that's exactly the most appalling thing you could have said.
- If he stays with me, he'll get tied up.
- What about our romantic evening?
I'm not having them shag while I'm tied to a chair.
- Hardly my fantasy either.
- You're blowing off our evening I don't want him to come.
We come together, daughters of Gaea, sisters to the moon.
We walk with the darkness, the wolf at our side, through the waterfall of power to the blackest heart of eternity.
I think we should have a bake sale.
- I don't know.
- You guys like a bake sale, right?
We need money for the dance recital, and I do an empowering lemon Bundt.
The most important thing is the Gaea newsletter.
We need to get the message of blessing out to the sisters.
Also, who left their scented candles dripping all over my woman-power shrine?
Well, this is good.
I mean, this is all fun, you know.
But there's also other stuffthat we might show an interest in, as a Wicca group.
Like what?
Well, there's the wacky notion of spells.
You know, conjuring, transmutation.
Yeah, then we could get on our broomsticks and fly around on our broomsticks.
You know, certain stereotypes are not very empowering.
- I think that - One person's energy can suck the power from an entire circle.
No offence.
- Well, maybe we could - Yeah, Tara?
Guys, quiet.
Do you have a suggestion?
OK, let's talk about the theme for the bacchanal.
- So not stellar, huh?
- Talk.
All talk.
Blah, blah, Gaea.
Blah, blah, moon.
Menstrual life-force power thingy.
After a couple of sessions, I was hoping we would get into something real, but No actual witches in your witch group?
No.
Bunch ofwanna-blessed-bes.
You know, nowadays every girl with a henna tattoo and a spice rack - thinks she's a sister to the dark ones.
- I'm sorry it was a bust.
I know you wanna go further in that department.
I'd just like to float something bigger than a pencil someday.
Hey, how's with you and Riley?
You two seemed pretty snuggly after class.
See above, re talk.
All talk.
- Do I have to tie you two together?
- We almost, but Well, get with it.
I need my vicarious smoochies.
I don't know.
I get nervous and I start babbling.
And he starts babbling and it's a babblefest.
Plus, every time we talk, I have to lie.
The Slayer thing comes up one way or another.
I wish I could just come clean.
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, I know I can't.
- But it bugs me this time.
- This is the burden we bear, brother.
We have a gig that would inevitably cause any girl living to think we are cool upon cool.
Yet we Clark Kent our way through the dating scene, never to use our unfair advantage.
- Thank God we're pretty.
- But it's just Buffy's special.
You think she's special?
Wow.
The first but now I see that you think she's special.
See, you're naturally inclined to talk too much.
I don't have that.
Then get with the kissin'.
- Riley Finn.
- Initiative vocal-code match complete.
- Don't see why I have to be tied up.
- It's just while I'm sleepin'.
Like I'd bite you anyway.
- Oh, you would.
- Not bloody likely.
I happen to be very biteable, pal.
I'm moist and delicious.
All right, yeah, fine.
You're a nummy treat.
And don't you forget it.
Xander, don't you care about me?
- Shut up.
- We never talk.
Shut up.
- Xander.
- Shut up.
"They need to take seven".
Take seven what?
- Olivia.
- Sorry I'm so late.
- The flight was a horror.
- Oh, no.
- Bad weather?
- Baseball movie.
- So sorry.
- Yeah.
That's enough small talk, don't you think?

news from Sunnydale, California.
Apparently the entire town has been quarantined, due to an epidemic of- as strange as this maysound- Iaryngitis.
Itseems the town has been rendered unable to speak.
There's no wordyet whatmighthave caused this or what other effects mightbe seen.
Localauthorities have issued a written statement blaming recentflu vaccinations.
A fewsceptics callita citywide hoax.
Sunnydale has effectively shut down allschools.
Businesses willbe closedfor the time being.
Residents are advised to stayhome andrest up.
The Centers forDisease Control have ordered the town quarantined.
No one can go in or out until the syndrome is identified or the symptoms disappear.
We'llbringyou more on thatas it develops.
Because there willbe chaos.
You willhelp keep order.
Dress as civilians.
A militarypresence would only increase panic.
We are looking into it.
Go.
Help maintain order.
We will findan answer.
You were there looking for me?
I thought maybe we could do a spell.
Make people talk again?
I'd seen you in the group, the Wicca group.
You were different than them.
I mean, they didn't seem to know What they were talking about.
I think ifthey saw a witch, they would run the other way.
- How long have you been practising?
- Always.
I mean, since I was little.
My mom used to.
She She had a lot of power.
Like you.
Oh.
I'm not I don't have much in the way of power.
Really, I mean, most of my potions come out soup.
Besides, spells going awry, friends in danger - I'm definitely nothing special.
- No, you are.
So would you say this was your best visit ever?
All the time you used to talk to me about witchcraft and darkness and the like, - I just thought you were being pretentious.
- Oh, I was.
I was also right.
So everything you told me was true?
Well, no, I wasn't actually one of the original members of Pink Floyd, but But the monster stuff, yes.
Scary.
Too scary?
I don't know.
Hi.
Hi.
Well I guess we have to talk.
I guess we do.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Let's try again.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": I can'tbite anything.
I can't even hitpeople.
- How's with you and Riley?
- Every time we talk, I have to lie.
I wish I could just come clean.
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, I know I can't.
But Buffy's special.
- I guess we have to talk.
- I guess we do.
Somebody should speak before one of us graduates.
What are you?
Capricorn on the cusp ofAquarius.
You?
Sorry.
That came out a little blunter than I intended.
It's just you're amazing.
Your speed, your strength.
Also passionate, artistic and inquisitive.
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.
The rest What I do I can't tell you.
Well, then, let me.
You're part of some military monster squad that captures demons, vampires Probably has official-sounding euphemisms for them, like "unfriendlies" or "non-sapiens".
Hostile subterrestrials.
So, you deliver these HSTs to a bunch of lab coats, who perform experiments on them, which, among other things, turn some into harmless little bunnies.
- How am I doin' so far?
- A little too well.
Meanwhile, by day, you pretend to be Riley Finn, cornfed lowa boy.
Ever been to lowa, Riley?
God, ifthat's even your name.
It is.
Born and raised.
And hey, bulletin: I'm not the only one who's been a little less than honest here.
I thought a professional demon-chaser like yourselfwould have figured it out by now.
I'm the Slayer.
Slayer.
Chosen One.
She who hangs out a lot in cemeteries?
You're kidding.
Ask around.
Look it up.
Slayer, comma, the.
And you fight demons?
I mean, you whaled on those guys.
- You did pretty well yourself.
- Yeah, but I'm a walking bruise today.
You see me with my clothes off, I look like I mean, I have bruises I don't see a scratch on you.
- You're not looking hard enough.
- I'm looking pretty hard.
So then - What do we do?
- I don't know.
I just I really thought that you were a nice, normal guy.
I am.
Maybe by this town's standards, but I'm not grading on a curve.
I think we both need a little time to process everything.
- Maybe then - Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
- I don't think I need to tell you - I won't say a word.
Good.
It'll be safer for all Over here.
Wow.
That was some ride!
Sorry I'm so excited.
It's my first earthquake.
It's not mine.
My soddin' sleeping chair's bloody sodden.
The quake knocked a couple of pipes loose.
There's a wrench over by the workbench.
- Try tightening the coupling.
- Do I look like a plumber to you?
No, you look like a big mooch who doesn't lift a finger here, but I have to get to work.
Yeah, delivering melted cheese on bread, doing your part to keep America constipated.
Mock not.
Remember who pays for the plasma round here, pal.
You earn your keep, or you don't get kept.
When you're done fixing that leak, try cleaning up this mess.
And doing a little laundry for once wouldn't kill you, unfortunately.
Hey!
I was in the library during the quake.
Almost got buried in some 19th-century literature.
And I don't have to tell you how hard it is to dig through some ofthat stuff.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
A couple of broken knick-knacks, but no biggies.
Porter Dorm is completely blacked out.
So they're dealing with the crisis the only way they know how: Aftershock Party.
The dorm that had the Somebody Sneezed Party and the Day That Ends ln Y Party.
They do seem to be pretty generous with the milestones.
Hey, you should ask Riley to come.
Much carousing by flattering candlelight.
Riley's, um, busy.
I'm pretty sure.
But you go on ahead and I'll catch up with you there.
I'm on my way for a little Giles one-on-one.
- Anything wrong?
- Wrong?
No.
Not at all.
- Something horrible's gonna happen.
- It was an earthquake.
Not uncommon in southern California.
No reason to think it was anything more.
I so have a reason.
A darn good reason.
The last time we had an earthquake, I died.
Yes, I know that, and therefore I completely understand your anxiety.
Oh, good.
Cos I'd hate for my little untimely horrible death concern to be ambiguous.
But unless evidence suggests otherwise, we can assume that it's shifting landmasses and not a portent of some imminent doom.
Now, in the meantime, I've got a few theories about our mysterious commando friends.
- Really?
- Based on the locations of our sightings, and Spike's reluctant description oftheir underground installation What ifthe quake was a sign - a bad omen - and we ignore it?
There'll be a lot of red faces when the world ends.
Buffy, ifthe quake heralded some such catastrophe, I'm sure there will be other signs to follow which will afford us plenty oftime to avert it.
I believe the commando installation is either very close to or directly under your school.
Ifthat is the case, one or more ofthem may be in your very midst.
- Plague!
- What?
Ifthe end ofthe world comes in the form of a plague, too many people may be infected Buffy!
Will you stop worrying about what may be and concentrate on what is.
Vigilance is all well and good, but as we're close, there is a more pressing question.
- What's a slayer?
- Slayer?
Thrash band.
Anvil-heavy guitar rock with delusions of Black Sabbath.
- No.
A girl, with powers.
- Oh.
The Slayer.
- Oh, yeah, I've heard ofthe Slayer.
- Fill me in.
Well, the Slayer is like some kind of bogeyman for the subterrestrials, something they tell their spawn to make 'em eat their vegetables.
- You're telling me she doesn't exist.
- Wait a sec.
Am I bursting somebody's bubble here?
Maybe this is a bad time to tell you about the Easter Bunny?
Sorry, sorry.
It's a myth, Rye.
All a part ofthat medieval folklore garbage kooks dream up to explain things we deal with every day.
How do you explain the things we deal with, Forrest?
They're just animals.
Rarer than the ones you grew up with on that farm in Smallville Where's that hypo?
Never mind.
Like I said, animals.
What's that racket?
Animals rattling in their cages.
Been doin' it all day.
- What's got 'em all worked up?
- Earthquakes.
They make everybody crazy.
You sayyou wanna help me out Butyoujustfillmyhead with doubt Hey, lgotmy own reality anditsure ain't virtual It's myhighway, I choose My lane andl control the cruise Yeah, lgotfeelings butbetyourass they're notmutual Percy!
Hi!
Hey, Willow.
What's goin' on?
Stuff.
I thought you got that football scholarship to USC.
- I did.
Laurie goes here.
- Hey.
Hi.
Some party, huh?
It's OK.
- How's Oz?
- Oh, actually, Oz Listen, we're gonna go get some drinks.
Cool to see you.
Bye.
Yeah, catch you later.
Hey, you guys serious about naked limbo?
I'm in.
Buffy, where are you?
So I can watch you flirt with that redhead?
What, Rosenberg?
She's just some egghead who tutored me a little in high school.
She's nice, but come on - captain ofthe nerd squad.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you have a thing for geeks.
Uh, no.
I like my women hot.
Call me old-fashioned.
Hello?
Anyone in here?
Spike, the place looks worse than when I left!
You didn't even fix the drip!
Don't turn around.
- Spike, what is it?
What happened?
- Don't look at me.
I shrunk them.
Bleeding shirt, trousers I hate this place.
I'm no happier about you wearing my stuffthan you are.
Go out.
Get me some decent stuff.
And I want more blood.
No!
You're not a guest.
You want me to tear this place apart, you poof?
That's it!
I am way past through with you.
I hate to break it to you, O impotent one, but you're not the Big Bad any more.
You're not even the Kind of Naughty.
You're nothing but a waste of space - my space!
And as much as I got a big laugh watching Buffy kick your shiny white bum, and as much as I know lcan give you a bum-kicking, I'm here to tell you somethin'.
You're not even worth it.
I'm outta here.
Buffy!
Over here.
Wow.
I wasn't sure where the party was, and then I saw the lights and the ambulance and I was, like, "Right, of course.
Death, carnage It's a Buffy party".
I'm so glad you're here.
- What happened?
- I found him, this guy, on the bed with me.
Dead.
Not me dead, he dead.
God, are you OK?
Vampire?
There was so much blood, and there was a symbol.
- And Percy said I was a nerd.
- Percy called you a nerd?
I guess we should report to Giles, get with the demon-tracking.
Does Percy even go here?
OK, that makes 0-4 billion.
You don't got game, son.
What's going on in that head ofyours?
I'm just trying to make up my mind about something.
Buffy.
She's pretty cool, isn't she?
Yes already!
She's cool, she's hot, she's tepid, she's all-temperature Buffy.
Now can we concentrate on the game here?
Good block.
Use your face more often.
- We have an alpha code-blue situation.
- One of ours?
- Negative.
Civilian at the Porter Hall party.
- HST attack?
Cannot confirm.
I couldn't get close without drawing attention to myself.
Should we mobilise?
No, I'll go.
Do a little recon.
See if it falls in our domain.
You alert Professor Walsh.
Tell her we have a casualty of an indeterminate nature.
Let's not make a move until we get the whole story.
Itjust made me feel like I was right back in high school.
Dumb jock.
If it wasn't for you, he still would be.
I mean, I know the Percy thing isn't really important.
- It's the dead guy on the bed.
- Yeah, that's bad, too.
Ooh, and something else.
He - the dead guy - was propped up, Iike whatever killed him wanted to drain the blood out of him.
So I'm thinking the "whatever" took a bunch ofthe guy's blood with him.
And I haven't been a nerd for a very long time.
Hello!
Dating a guitarist!
- Or I was.
- Tell them about the symbol.
Right.
It was carved into his chest, like a big creepy eye.
It's kind ofthe CBS logo.
Hey, could this be the handiwork of one Mr Morley Safer?
I've seen this somewhere before.
I just can't remember where.
- I mean, it's like - It's the end ofthe world.
Again?
It's the earthquake.
That symbol is I told you.
I said "end ofthe world" and you're like "Pooh, pooh, southern California".
I'm so very sorry.
My contrition completely dwarfs the impending apocalypse.
No, it can't be.
We've done this already.
It's the end ofthe world.
Everyone dies.
It's rather important, really.
So what do we do?
I stop it.
I wonder where I've seen this before.
Where else?
The place I spend most of my waking hours memorising stuff offthe sides of mausoleums.
Big freaky cereal boxes of death.
Door was open.
Wow!
That flippy thing that you did - Where did it go?
- It's gone.
- I saw it take offtoward the woods.
- And you didn't follow it?
No weapons, no backup.
You don't go after a demon that size by yourself.
- I do.
- Yeah, well, I'm no slayer.
- Base One, this is Lilac One.
- Lilac?
Go.
Sighting of an unidentified Sub-T.
Mobilise patrol team for debriefing at 0800 hours.
Copy that.
Very commandery.
Lilac notwithstanding.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
She who hangs out in cemeteries.
Well, I have to get the demon.
Don't sweat it.
We'll bag it.
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, but - Look, I really think - Riley, I just - I can't.
- Can't talk?
Can't any of it.
I can't be with you.
It's a huge, black pit of a mistake and I can't go there again.
Again?
You've dated me before?
No!
Look, I was involved - You don't know what my life is like.
- I'm dying to find out.
Dying being the operative word here.
There's too much risk.
There is too much It's just doomed.
And I can't do doomed again right now.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand where this is coming from.
You like me.
It's not like we don't have anything in common.
- But that's not enough.
- Buffy, I'm thrown by this.
I'm confused.
But I can feel my skin humming.
My hands, my every inch of me.
I've never been this excited about anybody before.
I'm not trying to scare you and I'm not gonna force myself on you, but I am, by God, not gonna walk away because I think it might not work.
I don't know what's happened in your past Pain, death, apocalypse.
None of it fun.
Do you know what a hellmouth is?
Do you have a fancy term for it?
Because I went to high school on it for three years.
We do not have that much in common.
This is ajob to you.
- It's notjust ajob.
- It's an adventure, great.
But for me, it's destiny.
It is something I can't change, something I can't escape.
I'm stuck.
You don't have to be.
You're not in high school any more.
- You can change things.
- Riley, no.
- I know it may seem - Riley!
My answer is no.
- A Vahrall demon.
- Ew!
- I second that revulsion.
- Yes.
"Slick like ghoul and gird in moonlight, father of portents and brother to blight".
"Limbs with talons, eyes like knives, bane to the blameless, thief of lives".
Three metres tall, approximately 100-120 kilograms, based on my visual analysis.
- Special hazards?
- Unknown.
Probably nothing we haven't handled before.
There's no pattern we can discern, so we assume it's on a "kill, crush, destroy".
It isn't digging up the bones of a child for fun.
A demon's got some pretty hilarious ideas about fun.
The bones of a child, though.
I saw that An ancient ritual.
It uses the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and something called the Word ofValios.
It's all part of a sacrifice.
The sacrifice ofthree.
Let me guess - ends the world?
Well, yeah.
It's not big with the details, though.
It doesn't say how the world ends or what the ritual entails exactly.
The sacrifice ofthree.
Three people are gonna die?
No, they won't.
Because Claw Boy is not getting all of his ingredients.
We have to find the Word ofValios, keep him from getting it.
If he doesn't already have it.
I mean, who knows where he's been?
Here's one for the good guys.
This thing's got a pheromone signature a mile wide.
Agent Gates has been working with the detection system.
Can't tell where it's going, but I know where it's been.
Residual traces showing up in populated areas.
The thing's not shy.
We're going out in civvies.
Weapons stowed in packs.
Keep 'em out of sight till nightfall.
Remember, this isn't a capture, it's a kill.
Pick up assignments from me.
We'll blanket the town.
I'll check the magic shop for a book called the Word ofValios.
- How about the museum?
- We'll stop by my house, get weapons, and I'll change into something that isn't quite as anchovy-scented.
This thing takes wicked very seriously.
Be careful.
I couldn't stand anybody getting hurt.
Goodbye, Dru.
See you in hell.
What are you doing?
Bloody rot!
Can't a person knock?
- What are you doing?
- You were trying to stake yourself.
Fag off!
It's no concern ofyours.
Is too.
For one thing, that's my shirt you're about to dust.
For another, we've shared a lot.
You should have trusted me enough to do it for you.
- Xander.
- What?
He wants to die, I wanna help.
It's ooky.
We know him.
We can'tjust let him poof himself.
Oh, but you can.
You know I'd drain you drier than the Sahara if I had halfthe chance.
Besides, I'm beyond pathetic.
Stuck in this basement washing skivvies for a blighter I wouldn't have bothered to bite a few months ago.
I mean, am I even remotely scary any more?
Tell me the truth.
Well, the shirt is kinda not very threatening, and the short pants But it could also be cos I know you can't bite, which isn't what you really need to hear - Stop.
Look, just clear out, OK?
- Fine.
But you break anything else - and you'll be sleeping in the garage.
- We can't leave him here like this.
- We'll have to take him to the museum.
- You go on.
I won't do anything.
I feel better now.
Promise.
Ifwe don't find what we're looking for, we're facing an apocalypse.
Really?
You're notjust saying that?
Buffy.
- Is this really the time for Donkey Kong?
- What?
It takes trace readings ofthe creature's pheromones.
And?
And it's either mating season for this thing or it's movin' all over town.
- You know, Buffy - Actually, I need to go.
- Big Bad needs to be squished.
- Right.
I'm on it, too.
It's just, this thing, this you-and-me thing, it's stupid.
I know.
Which is why we can't do it, the you-and-me thing.
No, I mean you're stupid.
I mean, I don't mean that.
- No, I think maybe I do.
- Wow.
With sweet talk like that, - you'll definitely melt my reservations.
- I'm serious.
You have this twisted way of looking at things.
This doom-and-gloom mentality.
You keep thinking like that and things will probably turn outjust the way you expect.
You know, there's nothing more dangerous than a psych grad student.
Buffy, where is the bad here?
It turns out that we're even more well-matched than we thought we were.
I mean, you're a fry cook and so am l. Yes, but you're an amateur fry cook, and I come from a long line offry cooks that don't live past 25.
Which is exactly the attitude I'm talking about.
Look, I know the risks ofwhat we do.
I also know it's more rewarding than any otherjob on the planet.
And fun!
Fun?
The last person I know that believed that is in a coma right now because she had so much fun on the job.
I'm not saying you shouldn't take your work seriously.
That I should just turn my frown upside down?
ls that it?
I wish I could.
But this isn't the kind of gig where you can just hang it up at night - and snuggle with your honey.
- Why can't it be?
Because I tried it, OK?
And every time itjust fell apart.
Then I get sucked right back into the Uber-evil.
Welcome to the story ofthe world.
Things fall apart, Buffy.
And evil, it comes and goes.
But the way people manage is, they don't do it alone.
They pull each other through.
Ifyou weren't so self-involved you'd see that.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
You barely know me.
I know that it's notjust the job thing.
I'm sure there's some good-looking guy who done you wrong in there, too.
But mostly I think you wanna stay down in the dark place, - cos maybe it's safer down there.
- You are so out of line.
No.
See, I don't think so.
We have an opportunity, you and me, but the fact that you're too scared to even try Is my business.
So why don't you just leave me alone?
Fair enough.
- Great.
No Word ofValios.
- Not even a syllable ofValios.
So I'm one step closer to melting in a sea of molten hellfire?
You shouldn't talk like that.
OK, so you can't kill any more, but there's other fun things you can do.
You'll adjust.
Adjust?
And what?
End up like the two ofyou?
No, thank you.
Here it goes.
"We can'tjust leave him here to stake himself.
It's not right".
I should think you would be glad to greet the end of days.
I mean, neither one ofyou is making much of a go at it.
You Kids your age are going offto university.
You've made it as far as the basement.
And Red here, you couldn't even keep Dog Boy happy.
You can take the loser out of high school, but You're trying to get us to dust you.
Am not!
I just don't want pity from geeks more useless than I am.
We're not useless.
We help people.
We fight the forces of evil.
Buffy fights the forces of evil.
You're her groupies.
She'd do just as well without you, better I'd wager, since she wouldn't have to save your hides all the time.
That is so not true.
We're part ofthe team.
She needs us.
Or you're just the same tenth-grade losers you've always been and she's too much of a softy to cut you loose.
Oh - as usual - dear.
- What happened?
- It's my fault.
I should have known.
Giles The Word ofValios is the name of a talisman, not a book.
- I blame myself entirely.
I had it here.
- You had it here?
I thought you were being too hard on yourself, but Thank you.
I bought it at a sorcerer's estate sale.
I only glanced at it once.
I thought it was a knockoff.
They have it.
They probably have their sacrifices by now, too.
They're on their way to perform the sacrifice now.
On their way where?
You found out what the ritual is for?
The Hellmouth.
They're going to open the Hellmouth.
The one in the library.
Looks like we're going back to high school.
OK, be careful, you guys.
The place doesn't look too stable.
Fine by me.
Hope we all go under.
Why is he even here?
It's not like he can fight.
Ifwe leave him alone, he'll stake himself.
And that's bad because?
Fine.
Whatever.
Just keep him out ofthe way.
I do not have time for this.
When we get to the library, look out for victims they're keeping alive for the sacrifice.
- Getting them out is the first priority.
- Will do.
OK.
You guys ready?
Let's rock and roll.
"Let's rock and roll".
Sunnydale High.
Ifthese walls were still walls, what stories they could tell.
Eeuw!
Mayor meat.
Extra crispy.
I think we're near the library.
Whoa.
Check out the new floor plan.
Three ofthem.
I don't see any sacrifice people.
They must be around here somewhere.
The ritual's not finished.
And it's not gonna be.
The blood!
Get the talisman.
They can't do the ritual.
I've got the bones!
Here!
You're picking on the wrong guy.
I've had a lot of practice at this with my lunch money.
Spike!
Right, perfect.
OK, I guess I won.
The demons!
They are the sacrifice!
No pain.
I can hurt a demon.
That's right.
I'm back, and I'm a bloody animal!
Yeah!
- No!
- Spike, not in the hole!
What?
I was helping.
Get outta here!
The building's gonna come down!
Don't let him jump in the Hellmouth.
If he does, we're finished!
I'm going in.
You're coming back out.
Buffy Well, hey!
Willow.
And Xander, right?
Jeez, what are the chances, huh?
Yeah, I was just passing by and I thought I heard people inside.
You were just passing by in your GI Joe outfit?
No offence, but you do look wicked conspicuous.
I do?
Paintball.
Yeah, I was playing paintball.
And then the aftershock - So, you're one ofthe commando guys, huh?
- Oh, no, no, no.
Commando?
No, I mean - Do I know you?
- Me?
No.
No, sir.
I'm just an old pal of Xander's here.
Oh.
That's nice.
- It's kinda weird being back, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Everything seems so small.
And more charred and ruiny.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - How long have you been practising?
- Since I was little.
Agent Finn is in charge ofthis operation.
I'm counting on you, Riley.
I can'tbite anything.
I can't even hitpeople.
No pain.
I can hurta demon.
You really have a lot to learn about women, Riley.
You're gonna teach me.
- What are you?
- I'm the Slayer.
Not expecting anyone, are we?
Willow said she was gonna be at the science library all night.
Is that right?
- Apparently not.
- We got trouble.
- What is it?
- I was in the rec room.
It came in the window.
- Vampire?
- Vampires don't breathe fire.
- I should call for backup.
- No time.
We have to make this fast.
I have better things to do tonight than kill.
Surprise.
Surprise.
Guess you won't be killing anything tonight.
Don't be so sure.
This is a lively space.
It's like an activity room we had at public school.
I One time I got up to a bit of a prank with the dartboard.
- I'm bored.
Let's eat.
- Anya, we've talked about this.
I'm sorry.
That was rude.
Please continue your story.
Hopefully it involves treacle and a headmaster.
- Go and eat.
- OK.
Giles.
Hi.
Havin' a good time?
Yes, yes.
There's a lot of new faces here, aren't there?
Yeah.
Mostly kids from the dorm.
A couple of Riley's friends.
- Hi, Giles.
- Buffy.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- 19.
It's hard to believe.
- There's someone I want you to meet.
This is Riley Finn.
- My boyfriend.
- Very nice to meet you, Mr Giles.
Did you help plan this?
It was quite a surprise.
The first of many.
- Been dating long?
- Giles was the librarian at my high school.
Ah.
I've seen the library.
It's gone downhill since you left.
I'm embarrassed to say that I actually miss it at times.
- So, you're retired?
- I'm sorry?
Or, you're working somewhere else now?
Well, not I'm sort of between projects right now.
It's a personal Oh!
Oh, look.
Giles has no cake.
Oh, here.
Here, I'll get you a piece.
He's just nervous.
But this is so nice.
Having everyone together for my birthday.
Of course, you could smash my toes with a hammer and it would still be the bestest Buffy birthday bash in a while.
Right.
Actually, Willow and Xander did all the planning.
I'm not sure I would've gone with a surprise party.
You know, you have enough things jumping out at you in the dark.
Professor Walsh says adrenaline is like exercise, but without the exorbitant gym fees.
- Very witty.
- You should meet her.
She's absolutely the smartest person I've ever met.
Perhaps we should've invited Professor Walsh.
Oh, no.
I mean, she's, like, 40.
She's got better things to do than hang out with kids.
Here you go, sir.
You own nothing.
This shouldn't be taking so long.
Hang on.
Let a fella get organised.
That's my radio.
And you're what?
Shocked and disappointed?
I'm evil.
- So what kind of place are you looking for?
- I don't know.
Maybe a crypt.
Some place, you know, dark and dank.
- But not as dark and dank as this.
- It's pretty depressing, isn't it?
I've known corpses with a fresher smell.
In fact, I've been one.
That's it.
Let's go.
Wait.
I wanna give you something for your new place.
That's my lamp.
A gift is traditional.
I've read about it.
That's among friends.
With bitter enemies, we don't give them my lamp.
It's not gonna have electricity anyway.
It's a crypt, remember?
What about running water?
A fridge to keep your blood fresh?
- No.
- Oh.
Well, that's gotta suck.
- You should just get a hotel room.
- Demon Girl's got a point.
I need fresh blood.
If I had a few bob for a room with an honour bar Out.
Before I get the Slayer over here to kick your ass out.
Don't know why she didn't come.
Say goodbye, shed a few tears Well, she has an appointment with someone who's actually still scary.
So, the Slayer.
Yeah.
That's me.
- We thought you were a myth.
- Well, you were myth-taken.
And to think, all that time you were sitting in my class.
Well, most ofthose times.
I always knew you could do better than a B minus.
Now I understand your energies were directed to the same place as ours, in fact.
It's only our methods that differ.
We use the latest in scientific technology and state-of-the-art weaponry, and you, if I understand correctly, poke them with a sharp stick.
- Oh, it's more effective than it sounds.
- Oh, I'm quite sure ofthat.
As I'm just as sure we can learn much from each other.
I'm working on getting you clearance for the lnitiative.
I think you'll find the results of our operation most impressive.
Agent Finn here alone has killed or captured How many is it?
I mean, that's 17.
- What about you?
- Me?
How many hostiles would you say you've slain?
"Third new moon after the Oh, crap.
No, we can't wait for her, Willow.
The demon Prince Barvain is going to rise tonight.
Well, where is she, exactly?
Those were my best stories.
And I didn't tell you the "Buffy breaks her butt" stories.
But you killed the You did the thing with that You drowned.
And the snake?
Not to mention the daily slayage of It's no big, really.
Hey, who wants ice cream?
Buffy When I saw you stop the world from, you know, ending, I just assumed that was a big week for you.
Turns out I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse.
Look, ifyou'd been fighting since you were 15, you'd have a hefty résumé too.
- 15?
- I know, wow.
The point is that we have different amounts of experience, you know.
Plus, I do have that preternatural slayer-strength deal.
I've seen.
Don't get me wrong.
Girls I grew up with could hold their own.
But Well, I'm not even sure I could take you.
That all depends on your meaning.
Yeah?
Professor Walsh, I presume.
You're hard to find.
These halls are quite the labyrinth.
I felt like Theseus and the Minotaur in the labyrinth.
Can I help you with something, Mr?
Giles.
Rupert.
I'm looking for Buffy Summers.
I'm a friend of hers.
And I was her high-school librarian.
I'm sorry, Buffy's not here.
But, if I see her Buffy's been very influenced by your course.
She quotes you quite often.
Sometimes she sounds a bit like an introductory textbook herself.
I don't lecture from the textbook.
But I'm glad she's inspired by the material.
She's bright.
All she's really been lacking is encouragement in the academic setting.
Erm, I think it's best if ifwe let a young person find their own strengths.
Ifyou lead a child by the hand, then they'll never find their own footing.
And if it's true about hiking, ergo it must be true about life.
Well, that's not I'm just saying Buffy is a Well, she's not the typical student.
Once you get to know her, she's a very unique girl.
- I hope you're not going to push her.
- I think I do know her.
- And I have found her to be a unique woman.
- Woman.
Of course.
- She's self-reliant, independent - Exactly.
Which is not always a good thing.
I think it can be unhealthy to take on adult roles too early.
What I suspect I'm seeing is a reaction to the absence of a male role model.
- Absence?
- Buffy clearly lacks a strong father figure.
I'm sorry, I have things to do.
I'll tell Buffy her friend was looking for her.
This prince-demon guy was supposed to rise at sunset, so aren't we, like, late?
Well, if I hadn't had to search for Ms Summers and battle that harridan - And ifyou hadn't gotten lost afterwards - I'll just take care of it myself.
I've vanquished a few demons in my day.
Course, we may be entirely too late - demon on the loose, carnage everywhere Your better demons will clean up after themselves.
I don't understand.
There should be ruptured earth and broken stone.
Oh, well, apparently it hasn't happened yet.
A bit of luck.
Or You know what I bet?
I bet the lnitiative took care of it.
- Who?
- Oh, Riley and his guys.
Probably all over it.
Yeah.
It has that too-neat look.
They must've cleaned up the place.
What?
Oh, they raid hot spots - areas of otherworldly energy.
They must've picked this place up days ago.
Stop, both ofyou.
What What are you talking about?
What's the lnitiative?
What on earth does it have to do with Buffy's new boyfriend?
You know.
I'm sure you know.
Riley's one ofthe commandos.
What?
Well, that's marvellous, isn't it?
I've spent weeks trying to get a single scrap of information about our mysterious demon collectors, and no one bothers to tell me Buffy's dating one ofthem?
- Who else knows?
- No one.
No one else knows this.
Anya, and that's it.
- And Spike.
- Spike?
- Spike knew?
- Only the basic stuff.
You know, that Riley is a commando and Professor Walsh is in charge Professor Walsh?
That fishwife?
You know, she's actually not that bad once you get So, the demon's probably a little late.
- We'll just, you know - Oh, forget it.
Go on, you two clear off.
I'll stay a little longerjust in case.
You sure?
Cos we could stay.
No.
Go.
Who am I kidding?
Nothing is going to happen.
I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say that at all.
In fact, Ripper, old mate, I'd say something rather interesting was about to hap - Did someone?
- Oh, bugger.
I thought you'd gone.
Ethan Rayne.
You have no idea how much thrashing you is going to improve my day.
No.
No, wait.
Hang on.
You can beat the crap out of me.
Go ahead, I can't stop you.
Or you can listen to what I have to say.
Find out what's going on.
- What are you talking about?
- Something bad's happening.
For both of us.
- Bad for you.
- No, no, no.
You have to listen.
You're going to need time to prepare.
Brilliant.
- Isn't this more fun than kicking my arse?
- No.
Oh.
Well, it's more fun for me.
Just tell me what you want to tell me.
Oh, so cross.
We used to be friends, Ripper.
When did all that fall apart?
About the same time you started to worship chaos.
Oh, religious intolerance.
Sad, that.
I mean, just look at the lrish Troubles.
Oh, hang on, I'll tell ya.
There's something happening in the dark worlds.
It's all whispers and rumours out there, but only one thing's coming through clear, that something's harming demons.
And it's not the Slayer.
- Know anything about it?
- What are they saying?
Oh, you know demons.
It's all exaggeration and blank verse.
"Pain as bright as steel", things like that.
They're scared.
There's something called "314" that's got 'em scared most of all.
The kind of scared that turns to angry.
I know we're not particularly fond of each other, Rupert, but we are a couple of old mystics.
This new outfit, it's blundering into places it doesn't belong.
It's throwing the worlds out of balance.
And that's way beyond chaos, mate.
We're headed, quite literally, for one hell of a fight.
Are you holding back?
Are you?
Maybe a little.
Maybe a little too.
- I'll go all out ifyou will.
- Are you sure?
Here we go.
Riley.
Are you hurt?
I - I don't think so.
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to It's fine.
I'm good.
D'you know what gets me?
This is what gets me.
Walsh and her nancy ninja boys come in, and six months later the demons are pissing themselves with fear.
They never even noticed me.
- Who's Maggie Walsh?
- Oh, she's awful.
She said I was an absent male role model.
Absent, my arse.
I'm twice the man she is.
You know, you're really very attractive.
Here's my my name and number.
You give me a call, and I'll show you a good time.
- Yeah, thanks.
- We've gotta face it, we've changed.
Well, not you.
You're still sadistic and self-centred.
- Here's to me.
- The world has passed us by.
Someone snuck in and left this couple of clapped-out has-beens in our place.
I mean, this lnitiative Their methods may be causing problems, but they're getting the job done.
What am l?
I'm an unemployed librarian with a tendency to get knocked on the head.
Well, you won't have to worry about that any more, mate.
When you went to the loo, I slipped poison in your drink.
You'll be dead in an hour.
Just kidding.
- I'm gonna feel like hell in the morning.
- Relax.
Enjoy the night.
We're still a couple of sorcerers.
The night is still our time.
- Time of magic.
- To magic.
I'm glad you wanted to get together.
I know it's late.
I Thanks.
I was happy you called.
- We'll start out slow.
- OK.
- Willow?
- Yeah.
Start out slow doing what?
We're gonna float the rose, then use the magics to pluck the petals off, one at a time.
It's a test of synchronicity.
Our minds have to be perfectly attuned to work as a single delicate implement.
Cool.
And it should be very pretty.
It worked.
Now for the hard part.
The petals.
What the heck was that?
I don't know, but the petals are off.
I knew I'd feel like hell in the morning.
Wha?
What?
No.
Damn.
Ethan.
Oh.
And I liked that shirt.
I like pancakes cos they're stackable.
Ooh, and waffles, cos you can put things in the little holes ifyou wanted to.
You should always have a new boyfriend.
You're so much fun right now.
Hey, I didn't hear you come in last night.
Where were you?
The chem lab, by myself.
I was trying this new spell, floating a rose, when all of a sudden, zing, zing, zing.
Like, all around the room.
It was like a rose-based missile.
- Yikes.
- I know.
I think there's something out there.
I felt this presence, this dark-magics energy blocking the spell.
It's new.
Someone else doing magics?
Maybe.
If so, it's someone pretty powerful.
Mm.
I'll tell Giles about it.
Or maybe I'll tell Maggie.
She seemed interested in the mystical side ofthe demon-hunting biz.
Tell Giles.
He's feeling a little hurt right now.
How come you never told him about Riley bein' a commando?
Did.
- I didn't?
- He says no.
He's feeling neglected and out-of-the-loop-y.
Well, I mean, I didn't at first because Riley said not to, and And then, miaow, cat out ofthe bag, and I guess I just forgot that he didn't know.
I'll make it up to him when I see him.
Tomorrow.
I'm spending today with Riley.
Oh, yeah, I forgot - that's what you always do on the days when the earth rotates.
It's just going so well right now.
I think.
I hope.
I sort of kicked him across the room last night.
Um, that's not good.
We were sparring and he said not to hold back.
And he's a little dented.
But he said he was OK with it.
And I think he's OK with it.
- Do you think he's OK with it?
- I'm sure he is.
I mean, if he's not, you know, you had to do it.
He's right.
You can't walk around pretending you're less than you are.
- It wouldn't be right for you to hold back.
- Right.
- What?
- I held back a little.
Still asleep?
It's 10.30 in the morning.
Xander?
Xander, wake up.
- Mom?
- No, it's not Mom.
Now, when you look at me, you may be a little alarmed.
But there's no need.
It's me, Giles.
Now, Ethan has turned me into a demon, and I need your help.
Hello.
Yes, it's me.
Xander, listen.
Don't you understand me?
Demon.
Demon.
Please, don't you understand?
No.
No, don't.
Xander, calm down.
No, just Ow.
You're just a little overwrought.
Ow.
That's right.
Run for your life.
- I'm sorry.
- Call 911.
Bloody humans.
So it had pointy things.
What kind of pointy things?
The pointy kind.
And tufty ears.
And maybe a saucepan-shaped bruise.
Giles will know what it was.
Giles?
Looks like Xander wasn't the only one to get a visit.
- He's not upstairs.
- Oh, God, Giles.
OK.
There's a demon and Giles is gone.
But it doesn't mean that he's hurt.
I mean, there's no blood anywhere, so maybe the demon just took him somewhere.
I think it ate him up.
Well.
What do I spy with my little eye?
A demon.
That would be Oh, right.
The things I can kill.
Spike.
Wonderful.
The perfect end to a perfect day.
- Giles?
- Go on, then.
Let's get on with the fighting.
- You understand me.
- Of course I understand you.
- I'm speaking English?
- No, you're speaking Fyarl.
I speak Fyarl.
And, by the way, why the hell are you suddenly a Fyarl demon?
You just come over all demony this morning?
As a matter offact, I did.
Thanks to Ethan Rayne.
You have to help me find him.
He must undo this, and then he needs a good being killed.
And I'm supposed to just help you out ofthe evilness of my heart?
You help me and l I don't kill you.
Oh, tremendously convincing.
Try it again without the stutter.
Money.
I could pay you money.
Oh.
I like money.
How much?
$100?
$100?
You'll have to do a lot better than that.
- 200.
- Fine.
Right, then.
What's first?
I tell the Slayer what you've gotten yourself into?
No.
When I find Ethan I can clear all this up without Buffy ever having to find out.
OK, that's a giant vulture.
I'd have mentioned if it was a giant vulture.
Buffy, even ifwe figure out what kind of demon got Giles, how are we gonna find it?
We'll figure it out.
Oh.
This one has tufty ears.
What was that?
- Buffy.
- Riley.
What are you doing here?
There were 911 calls from a couple of different places.
Including here.
- You get 911 calls?
- We have a tap into the system.
It flags things with possible nonhuman causes.
We check 'em out.
- What are you doin' here?
- This is Giles' apartment.
He's missing.
- The calls.
Did anyone see what did it?
- Negative.
No.
Neighbours just heard, you know, growling and things breaking.
- Sounded like a struggle.
- Poor Giles.
We'll get him back.
- What are you workin' on?
- We have stuff.
Pictures.
We have nothing.
I'll help.
The whole lnitiative.
We'll do whatever you need.
Thanks.
I just wish I knew what I needed.
I keep thinking "Let's ask Giles".
Then I remember.
He'd be great right now.
He'd find himself in a second.
Nobody is cooler in a crisis.
Ifyou can't find third gear, don't try for third gear.
I'm doin' my best.
I don't know if I'm drivin' this thing or wearin' it.
It's perfectly serviceable.
Funny hearing a Fyarl demon say "serviceable".
Had a couple of 'em working for me once.
They're more: "Like to crush.
Crush now"?
Strong, though.
You won't meet ajar you can't open for the rest ofyour life.
- What was that?
Did you growl?
- No.
Listen, about this Fyarl demon.
Do I have special powers?
Like setting things on fire with my sizzling eye beams?
Well, you got the mucus thing.
What?
Mucus?
Paralysing mucus.
Shoots out through the nose.
Sets up fast.
Hard as rock.
Pretty good in a fight.
- Are you making this up?
- Maybe.
But, hey, ifyou feel a sneeze comin' on, you warn me.
Turn here.
- Downshift.
Downshift.
- Calm down, will you?
I'm not sure I can.
I feel like I'm changing.
Fine with me.
So long as you pay me.
I don't like this feeling.
A sort of mindless need to destroy.
This anger.
Rage.
Good times.
Go with it.
No.
It's fun.
I can't do it.
Do it for me.
Oh, let yourself go.
I refuse to become a monster because I look like a monster.
I have a soul.
I have a conscience.
I am a human being.
Oh, stop the car.
Right, let's go, then.
That's the thing that attacked me.
A Fyarl demon.
Sort of a foot-soldier type, works for other demons lots ofthe time.
Very strong And, hey, mucus.
Mucus?
Agent Finn.
Go ahead.
- How do I kill it?
- Silver.
A weapon made of silver.
Yes.
I understand.
The demon attacked Professor Walsh.
It got out of a small, grey car.
A Citroën.
It stole Giles' car.
- Why would a demon steal a car?
- Why would a demon steal that car?
A demon that steals a car has a reason.
A purpose.
But it doesn't sound like these Fyarl demons are really big independent thinkers.
So, Will, the spells that are going wrong, could they be caused by someone using magics to control a demon?
Making this Fyarl demon attack Giles?
Yeah.
Yes, that would draw in a lot of dark energy.
OK.
Willow, Xander, stay here.
Whoever it is may call and ask for a ransom.
Give 'em anything they want.
- You got it.
- Riley, we're going to the magic shop.
Something silver A letter opener?
It's not very sharp.
Then I'll have to put some muscle behind it.
Two ofthem.
English, like me.
But older, less attractive.
- One ofthem gave you his number.
- I threw it out.
I mean, I took one look and saw he was staying at that rat-trap.
No, thanks.
Which rat-trap?
The one by the highway.
The Sunnydale Motor lnn.
Thank you.
OK.
Credit-card slips, sales receipts Help me look.
- You shouldn't have done that to the door.
- I do not have time to play by the rules.
I have a master key.
It opens every shop on Main Street.
Well, next time, absolutely.
I don't know what I'm lookin' for.
I do.
Ethan Rayne.
- Who's that?
- Professional bad guy.
He's gotta be the guy that made the demon attack Giles.
- Command, are you there?
- What are you doing?
It's Finn.
I need a search.
Local hotel registrations matching the name Ethan Rayne.
R-a-y-n-e.
Call me back.
- You can do that?
- It'll take a couple of minutes.
Get in the car.
I'm ready to go.
Buffy.
Earlier, when I talked to Professor Walsh, she gave me very specific orders.
Yeah?
She said when we located the demon, l I'm not supposed to bring you along.
What are you doing?
- I'm going to the car.
- I can't take you with me.
You're not taking me with you.
I am going and I am letting you come along.
Buffy, it's not your call.
This is a military operation now.
Then call out the troops.
Because nothing less is gonna stop me.
This demon did something to Giles, and I'm gonna kill it.
- How are you feelin', mate?
- Like snapping necks until everyone's dead.
Now that sounds like a Fyarl demon.
Good for you.
- Hey, picked up a tail.
- Yes.
Just a little one.
It hurts when I sit.
I mean someone's following us.
Humvee.
Military.
- Well, speed up.
Lose them.
- I've got it floored.
Why'd you buy this car?
Do something.
Ifthey catch us, we'll both end up in a lab.
It's getting closer.
- And it's got a friend.
- Damn.
Oh, sure.
Dismantle the getaway car.
That'll scare 'em.
Slow down.
I'll jump out.
They'll follow you.
Hold on.
These commandos are after me too.
Maybe I want you around to split their attention.
I'll pay you another $100.
Giles?
Now, it Calm down.
It's OK.
Good Giles.
No.
No.
Don't kill me.
No.
Don't kill me.
Giles I can't undo you ifyou kill me.
You've gotta stop it.
It killed Ripper and now it's trying to get me.
Don't let him go.
What did you do to him?
What did you do?
You just try and stop me, you stupid jarheads.
You're only gonna make him angry.
- This is for Giles.
- For me?
Oh, God.
Giles?
Oh, God.
Giles.
Giles.
I'm I'm so sorry.
Please don't die.
Actually, I feel quite well.
Except for the rage.
I think he's OK.
Is this thing real silver?
I've really got to learn to just do the damage and get out oftown.
It's the "stay and gloat" - gets me every time.
You OK?
Oh, embarrassed, mostly.
Ethan's wardrobe's not helping any.
How did you know it was me?
Your eyes.
You're the only person in the world that can look that annoyed with me.
This gonna go on much longer?
I'd rather like to be going.
- And why would I let you go?
- Well, maybe because you have no choice.
I'm human.
You can't kill me.
What's a slayer gonna do to me?
The US military is taking you into custody, pending a determination ofyour status.
- We'll take it from here.
- Let's go.
Move it.
They'll take Mr Rayne to a secret detention facility in the Nevada desert.
I'm sure he'll be rehabilitated in no time.
Ifyou don't mind, I'm just gonna go and watch them manhandle him into a vehicle.
- Thanks.
- I told you I'd help.
You did.
If I'd gotten here any later, and if Giles had killed Ethan, I never would've gotten him back.
You'd find some other way.
You're really strong.
Like, Spider-Man strong.
Yeah.
But I don't stick to stuff.
But, yeah.
And you're in charge.
You're, like, make the plan, execute the plan No one givin' you orders.
I'm the Slayer.
I like it.
Yeah?
But give me another week to get ready and I'll take you down.
Nice phone.
Yes.
Fabulous technology.
See, if anyone has any information I need to know, they can simply tell me about it through this ingenious speaking tube.
- I'm very excited.
- I am sorry, Giles.
I really thought I'd told you about Riley and the lnitiative.
And I know that it doesn't help.
Look, I promise it won't happen again.
I will tell you everything.
Buffy, I don't want to ask you to betray any confidences, - and I certainly don't want to interfere - Uh-oh.
You have but-face.
You look like you're gonna say "but".
But this lnitiative.
I'm a little concerned.
Ethan's not exactly a reliable source, but I'm not sure that he's wrong about them.
I'm not dating the lnitiative.
I'm dating Riley.
- He's a good guy.
- And I believe that.
But he's part of something that we don't really understand.
Are you saying this because you don't like Riley's boss?
No.
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Though I do hate her quite a lot.
But I want you to have your personal life, but keep your eyes open.
Make sure you know what you're getting into.
So she walks in and the rules just suddenly break?
Pretty much.
Be careful with her.
She reacts on instinct.
There's no discipline there.
Her loyalties are uncertain.
You won't be disappointed in her.
She's good at what she does.
- And she is the truest soul I've ever known.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Spontaneous poetic exclamations.
Lord, spare me college boys in love.
I'm just saying she'll work out.
You'll be proud of her.
You want to know what I think?
I think you're probably right.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - What are you?
- I'm the Slayer.
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature without intense pain.
I can hurta demon.
That's right.
I'm back, and I'm a bloody animal.
I thought we made a pretty good team.
You're really strong.
I like it.
I implore you, Neesah, blessed goddess of chance and fortune, heed my call.
Send to me the heart I desire.
You know, magic at the poker table qualifies as cheating.
That wasn't magic.
I was praying.
Two, please.
Five.
An, I keep telling you, four's the max, and only ifyou have an ace.
- OK, four.
- Let's see the ace.
Three.
What a stupid game.
All these rules just to win little plastic discs.
Chips.
They're called chips.
They represent money, since none of us has any money.
But that'll change once my merchandise hits the street.
What ya got in the boxes?
Drugs?
- It's not drugs, is it, Xander?
- Not drugs.
You are looking at the new local distributor for Boost bars.
"The natural food bar that provides a nutritional boost for active, health-conscious people".
- Want one?
- No.
Thanks.
Those things usually taste kinda tasteless, and then leave a bad after-tastelessness.
Don't let the healthy scare ya.
Check out the ingredients.
See?
Loaded with fatty goodness.
Come on, somebody bet already.
I got three K cards.
Wish that Buff could've made it.
This three-hand poker is not quite the game.
Must be with Riley.
You know how it is with a spanking-new boyfriend.
Yes, we've enjoyed spanking.
Well, the thing is, I think Riley is OK, in an oafish kind ofway, but am I the only one with a question mark over his head about this lnitiative thing?
Well, they do seem to fall in the good-guy camp.
I mean, they are anti-demon.
- Probably pro ex-demon.
- Maybe.
- I choose to feel threatened.
- And why not?
There's still heaps we don't know about these commandos.
What exactly are they up to?
Riley.
It took the patrol team and you neutralised them in 28 seconds.
I was just lucky.
I see.
Well, still very impressive.
I was just being modest with the whole "Iucky" thing.
You got that, right?
I got it.
Awesome, Buffy.
See?
You're a hit.
Everybody loves you.
Then Professor Walsh said I was as amazing as Riley had said.
Later, he said she couldn't stop talking about a move I made where I used a commando as a shield to block a Taser blast.
It was, like, 12,000 volts.
It took the guy almost two hours to recover.
How was your night?
Like a normal person's.
Light on the action-packed.
Hope tonight's not too much of a letdown for ya, excitement-wise.
You do remember about tonight, right?
Bronze.
The gang.
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't be anywhere else.
I miss you guys.
We haven't spent much time together lately.
You've been busy.
Fighting armies and stuff.
Not to mention other distractions of a more romantic Rileyjust walked in.
Do ya wanna let him know you're here?
No.
Just enjoying a good stare.
Tell me about your night.
Well, spent most of it at Xander's teaching Anya to play poker.
- That sounds like fun.
- Except the Anya part and the poker part.
Will, I think you'd better get used to A Twinkie?
That's his lunch?
Oh, he is so gonna be punished.
- Everyone's gettin' spanked but me.
- What?
Nothing.
Hey, wipe your feet when you enter a person's home.
Oh, yes.
Careless of me.
Tracking mud all over your mud.
I admit, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.
Needs a woman's touch.
Care to have a crack at it?
While I'd love to go on trading jabs with you, Spike, perhaps I'll come to the point.
Much as it pains me to say it, I owe you a debt of gratitude for the help you provided me in my metamorphosis.
Stuffthe gratitude.
You owe me more than that, mate.
There's 300 there.
Count it ifyou like.
I'll do that.
Thinking about your affliction and new-found discovery that you can fight only demons, it occurs to me that I realise this is completely against your nature, but has it occurred to you there may be a higher purpose?
You made me lose count.
What are you still doing here?
- Talking to myself, apparently.
- Well, piss off, then.
This bit of business wraps up any I got with you and your slayerettes.
From now on, I want nothing to do with the lot ofyou.
Your choosing to remain in Sunnydale might make that a little difficult.
Well, you and yours'll just have to show a little restraint.
Now get out.
And I don't want you crawling back here knocking on my door pleading for help the second Teen Witch's magic goes all wonky or little Xander cuts a new tooth.
We're through.
Got it?
Honeymoon is over.
We don't have to do this.
I know.
I mean, ifyou'd rather wait.
I'm ready.
I want to.
Newretinalscan recorded: Summers, Buffy.
My God.
You said it was big.
You told me, but you never said it was huge.
I don't like to brag.
I had no idea.
This is incredible.
But not that I thought it was some fly-by-night operation.
Unless it is.
I mean, can you guys fly?
At night.
With those jet-pack things?
I can't really talk about it.
This is unreal.
So, you like our little operation?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's very clean.
Your visitor's pass.
And I've assembled some reading material to bring you up to speed.
Oh.
And I thought I was never gonna get homework from you again.
You can't take that home.
That's classified material.
Highly sensitive.
When you're through reading those pages you'll have to eat them.
- She's joking.
- Don't worry, it doesn't happen very often.
Shall we?
Much of our hands-on research with the HSTs is performed here.
We call this "The Pit".
And what do you call those?
Tough.
It took eight of us to bring 'em down.
They'll be under control soon.
Doctor Angleman.
Head of our science team.
A leader in the field of xenomorphic behaviour modification.
Behaviour modification?
We've made advances in reconditioning the subterrestrials.
Bringing them to a point where they don't pose a threat.
So I've seen.
On the Discovery Channel.
With gorillas and sharks.
They made them all nice.
You haven't seen it?
What's over there?
The armoury.
You'll have to be cleared for use on each ofthese weapons.
The more advanced arsenal is complicated, but I'm certain, in time, you'll pick that up.
- Don't pick that up.
- What is it?
- About $20,000.
- It's a prototype for a com-cam.
Communications camera.
Gives us a direct link to Control when we're out in the field.
Also monitors the heart rate ofthe wearer.
A good tool for research in stress in combat.
Ifyou'll follow me, I'll show you the HST containment area.
We have a few more things to give you.
- What's in there?
- Research area.
Very restricted for security reasons.
Here is your security card and your pager.
- Been thinking about gettin' one.
- We alone have the number, - and it stays that way.
- Right.
Lose either one ofthem, there's hell to pay.
And down here we mean that literally.
Again, welcome to the team.
Wow.
I've been trying to find a doll's-eye crystal my entire life.
Well, since June, anyway.
Where'd you get it?
It was my grandma's, I think.
I found it a long time ago in my attic.
I want you to have it.
Oh, no, Tara.
That's really sweet, but I can't.
It's like a family heirloom.
I just wouldn't feel comfortable.
But ifyou wanted to try out some spells with it sometime, I wouldn't say no.
Maybe tonight?
lfyou're not doing something, you could come over and we could do something.
Tonight.
That sounds really nice, but tonight, I already have plans with people.
Other.
That's OK.
Another time.
Absolutely.
It's just tonight, it's kind of a specific crowd.
You might feel out of place.
I'd better get to class.
Well, I'll see ya later.
OK?
- How did the tour go?
- I'm not sure.
She's unpredictable.
- She's an unnecessary risk.
- Possibly.
- How's our baby doing today?
- Adjusting nicely.
- Reflexes, motor functions.
All offthe charts.
- That's what I like to hear.
Almost time to wake up, Adam, and take your first look at the world.
I know you're gonna make me proud.
Xander?
You haven't been paying any attention to me tonight.
Just peddling those processed-food bricks.
I don't know why.
Well, let me put it in a way you'll understand.
Sell bars.
Make money.
Take Anya nice places.
Buy pretty things.
It does make sense.
All right, I support you.
Go sell more.
Well, this was the only one I had on me.
Besides, it's late.
Maybe we should go.
Go?
You can't go.
Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.
Let's face it.
She's almost an hour late.
She's living the life of Riley.
I doubt she's coming.
She is.
She said she was looking forward to spending quality time with just us.
See?
Here she comes.
With Riley and some other guys.
- Hi, all.
Sorry about the late-itude.
- Late?
Really?
Hadn't noticed.
- Hope you don't mind us tagging along.
- No, of course not.
The more the more.
This is Graham, this is Forrest, that's Kevin, and that's Jay in the back.
- We'll grab some drinks.
Want anything?
- Coke, please.
I'm good.
No.
- We're going away.
To dance.
Over there.
- We are?
Anya seems a bit on edge.
She's a little antsy around commando types.
Ex-demon issues.
I didn't think that you would mind.
Riley and the guys threw a celebration in my honour and it made it, like, impossible to not invite them.
Oh.
That's neat about the celebrating.
I just thought this was supposed to be, you know, us.
Just the Scooby Corps, you know.
I mean, I could have invited somebody else if I knew it was an open free-for-all.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
My total bad.
- So, who did you wanna invite?
- What?
- You said you wanted to invite someone.
- No, not No one.
I mean, I meant a hypothetical someone, which is to say no one.
- What are we celebrating?
- I'm in.
The lnitiative.
ProfWalsh gave me the grand tour, and I mean grand as in Canyon.
- You'd never believe the size of it.
- That's really Again, I say "neat".
So, what do you mean, exactly?
You've joined them?
No.
Not exactly.
It means that when I patrol, I'll have a heavily armed team as backup.
Plus, boyfriend going to work with me.
Big extra perk.
Buffy, do you really think this is a good idea?
I mean, don't you think you're rushing things a little?
- I thought you liked Riley.
- Not with Riley.
With the lnitiative.
I mean, there's a bunch of stuff about them we still don't know.
I know that.
Like what?
Well, what's their ultimate agenda?
I mean, OK, yeah, they neuter vampires and demons.
But then what?
Will they reintegrate them into society?
Get them jobs as bag boys at Wal-Mart?
Does Wal-Mart have bag boys?
Plus, don't forget that 314 thing that Ethan told Giles about.
Well, a man that worships chaos and tries to kill you is a man you can trust.
Bad info or not, certain questions should be asked before you go off and enlist.
That's us.
Let's go.
- When did you get a pager?
What's going?
- That's our cue.
Mother wants us.
- Will.
- I know.
Talk later.
So what's the big emergency?
This is your objective: Sub-T 67119.
Demon class: Polgara species.
Though visual confirmation has not been made, we're confident of its approximate position as it leaves behind a distinct protein marker.
Dr Angleman will briefyou on its defences.
When threatened, bone skewers jut from the creature's forearms during battle.
It's imperative when ensnaring it not to damage its arms.
That's all you really need to know.
Question.
Buffy?
Why exactly can't we damage this poker thing's arms?
I mean, not that I want to, it's just in my experience when fighting, body parts get damaged, and better its bits than mine.
Or ours.
We wish to study the physiology of every subterrestrial's natural defences.
Part ofthe research we do here.
Yes?
- What do they want?
- Want?
Why are they here?
Sacrifices, treasure, or theyjust get rampagey?
- I find it's easier to predict their responses - They're not sentient.
Just destructive.
They do have keen eyesight, however.
You might wanna be suited up for this.
Oh.
You mean the camo and stuff?
I thought about it, but, I mean, it's gonna look all Private Benjamin.
Don't worry, I've patrolled in this halter many times.
Let's give our attention to Dr Angleman and save questions till the end.
Actually, I'm finished.
Oh, well, Agent Finn, deploy the teams.
OK, listen up.
We'll be going in a four-squad setup.
Team leaders Gates, Taggart and Stavros.
Alpha team, you're with me.
Report to TLs for assignments and weapon requisitions.
Reminder: this is a zap 'n' trap, people.
Capture, not a kill.
Any questions?
Buffy.
Willow.
A funny thing happened with my prior social engagement.
Pretty much ended when a friend of mine went offto do something with another crowd she hangs out with.
Irony is kind of ironic that way.
Anyway, I know it's late, but I thought maybe I mean, ifyou still wanted to do something?
- So I guess she hates me now.
- What?
Professor Walsh.
Questions.
An lnitiative faux pas, yes?
It's a little unusual.
She's just not used to it.
You barely ever opened your mouth in her classroom.
But I know she likes you.
In fact, she liked you before I did.
- Really?
- Told me so herself.
- Maybe I should get her a present - Can we talk about this later?
There's a dangerous hostile out here, and since I don't have your reflexes, I kinda need to focus.
Right.
What do you mean, she liked me before you did?
You didn't like me?
- Itjust isn't right.
- He made you team leader, didn't he?
That's not the point.
I've always been Riley's second in command.
Instead he picks a girl.
- His girl.
- Whatever.
Three guesses on what that boy's thinkin' with.
Maybe he just wanted to let you get out from under his shadow.
Hey, I'm not under anybody's shadow.
It was ajoke, man.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
I'm just sayin' - Hang on.
Got somethin'.
- Target?
Negative.
- Hello, Hostile 17.
- You two, standard flanking.
Go.
Alert Control and Alpha team.
We've tagged Hostile 17 with a tracer and we're in pursuit.
Sir.
Graham's on the talkie for you.
Reception's not too good.
This is Alpha team, go ahead.
Say again.
You're breakin' up.
Riley.
So, what do you wanna do now?
I don't know how many more ways I can say "I'm not interested".
Check these flavours.
Cherry Berry.
Maple Walnut.
Almond Liquorice.
Eugh.
Anya, we don't say "Eugh" in front of potential customers.
Just skip this part and say you want money to buy me pretty things.
He'll understand.
Very well.
Maple Walnut.
An excellent choice.
- Please leave my home now.
- It's the gritty texture, isn't it?
Maybe you're more of a Cherry Berry fellow.
- Close the door.
- Spike?
You may wanna give up these morning jogs.
Soldiers are out.
I've been tryin' to keep 'em off my scent, run 'em in circles.
But they keep comin'.
And how is this our concern?
You expressed the wish to have nothing more to do with us.
Spike said that?
- That hurts.
- All right.
Whaddaya want me to say?
I need help.
And no cheek from you.
Look.
The buggers shot me in the back.
Remind me.
Why should I help you?
Because you do that.
You're the goody-good guys.
You're the bloody freaking cavalry.
No, you can come up with a better answer than that.
Why should I help you?
Oh.
Because I helped you.
When you turned into that Fyarl demon, I helped you, didn't l?
And that was out of the evilness ofyour heart?
Oh, hell, no.
I made you pay me You right bastard.
That's all that's left.
I spent the rest on blood and smokes, which I'll never see again.
Come on.
Circle the wagons.
Tend to the wounded here.
No time for layabouts.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Weren't expecting to see me?
I never know what to expect.
Your robot bird sounds hungry.
- It's just a reminder to take my vitamins.
- You're kidding.
I'm sorry.
Quite the regimental soldier.
- I am how they trained me.
- They?
- Who they?
- You know, the government.
Plucked me out of special op training for this.
- What did they tell you it was for?
- Didn't.
In the military you learn to follow orders, not ask questions.
I don't understand.
Aren't you curious about all the science and research stuffthey're doing?
I know all I need to know.
We're doing good here.
Protecting the public.
Removing the subterrestrial threat.
It's work worth doing.
What's 314?
- Riley.
- We have a situation.
You're needed.
- On my way.
- What is it?
Don't know.
You're really not one for asking questions, are you?
I'll leave that to you.
Lose your way, Agent?
No, ma'am.
I've instructed Beta team to suspend pursuit of Hostile 17 until your arrival.
I didn't want slip-ups, that's why you're in charge.
You'll rendezvous with them at these coordinates.
Riley.
Make me proud.
Yes, ma'am.
I think we've got a situation.
The Slayer?
- She's becoming a liability.
- We knew that was a danger.
- Does she know about the project?
- She knows it exists.
She already holds too much influence over Riley - over Agent Finn.
- We move to the contingency scenario?
- Right away.
That's too bad.
- She could have been a powerful ally.
- I know.
- And Finn will take it hard.
- That's why sooner is better.
It's better.
Watch it.
That hurts.
It doesn't appear to be a bullet.
It's too deeply embedded for a tranquilliser dart.
Also, not tranquil.
Some sort of illumination emanating from it.
It's blinking.
I don't care if it's playing "Rock the Casbah" on the bloodyjew's-harp.
Get it out of me.
Anya, there's a bottle of Cognac in the cupboard by the sink.
Can you get it?
- What?
Gonna get snockered now?
- It's not for me, you prat.
If I'm gonna operate, I need you anaesthetised.
This'll take time.
We don't have any.
That blinking thing?
My pseudo-soldier memory bank tells me that's a tracer.
- A what?
- A what?
It's like a homing beacon.
And if commandos are reading the signal, they're comin' home.
Well, we need to buy some time.
It's in deep, and I'm no surgeon.
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.
Out all night, huh?
You, too.
Yeah.
Sorry about bailing on you guys at the Bronze.
That's OK.
I Don't worry about it.
OK.
- They really keep ya hoppin', don't they?
- Yeah.
I gotta go.
I'll see ya?
- Hello?
- Willow.
You're there at last.
We have a problem.
Where's Buffy?
Just left.
Beeped away by her new buds.
You want me to go after her?
No, no.
It's your help I need, actually.
Really?
What do you want me to do?
It's a small job.
Reconnaissance.
Probably a waste of a slayer's abilities, - but my boys are on assignment, so l - No, it's OK.
I'm up for some action.
I doubt you'll get any on this one.
We've a class-three subterrestrial moving through the sewers -just on the north edge oftown.
- Class three?
It's a low-level threat.
Minimal aggression.
Meagre defences.
They barely show up on the scanner, and occasionally turn out to be raccoons.
Wow.
You're not crazy about raccoons, huh?
We always take precautions.
All we need you to do is get a visual on this thing.
This will feed me back an image, and I can advise you from there.
I don't wanna put you in unnecessary danger.
That's OK.
Danger's my birthright.
Sorry.
Professor Walsh, there's still some stuff about all this that I'm not clear on.
Well, when you get back we can have a talk.
Good.
OK.
When I get back.
Am I supposed to salute you?
No.
OK.
"Tropo, strato, meso, aero, iono, exo" So, how does it work?
If she succeeds, her spell will ionise the atmosphere, disrupting the tracer's signal.
- It buys us time.
- "Elements are brought to bear".
"Wind, earth and water churned amidst the fire".
"Let the air be burned".
Did it work?
ls the atmosphere ionised?
I'd venture "Yes".
- What do you mean, "the signal's whacked"?
- The blip's a blob.
- There's some interference with the tracer.
- Try to lock it down.
- We headed in the right direction?
- I think so.
It's gonna put us in populated areas.
OK, then.
We change into civvies then move out.
Maybe somethin' will turn up.
Professor Walsh, are you getting this?
Possible HST?
Make it a definite.
He's brought along a friend.
They seem Talk to me, Forrest.
Signal's somewhere in this neighbourhood.
Estimate within a two-block radius.
It feels, and looks, like the spell's wearing off.
- Giles?
- I've got it.
We wanna keep this hostile contained, so Wait.
The signal's cleared up.
- There.
- Let's go.
Go.
- What?
- It's on the move.
- Heading?
- Straight at us.
40 metres and closing fast.
- In broad daylight?
- Weapons at the ready.
- Where?
- To the left.
Ten metres Five - Anyone?
- I got nothing.
This doesn't make sense.
It went right past us.
Flushed.
The tracer's been flushed.
Regret to report Hostile 17's still at large.
- I've left Beta team to comb - Riley, something's happened.
I don't know what to say.
- It's about Buffy.
- Buffy?
Two of our hostiles broke free and escaped into the tunnels.
She went after them on her own.
She's dead, Riley.
- What?
- I did everything I could to stop her.
I told her to wait for a backup team.
She insisted she didn't need one, she could handle it by herself.
I'm so sorry.
- I don't understand.
- I know what she meant to you.
- How could this happen?
- She was a very special girl.
I didn't understand at first, but she had something.
I don't know, maybe I could have stopped her.
It's hard not to blame myself.
Professor Walsh?
Thatsimple little recon you sentme on?
It wasn'ta raccoon.
Turns outl was trappedin the sewers with a faulty weapon and two ofyourpet demons.
Ifyou think that's enough to killme, you really don'tknow whata slayeris.
Trustme when lsayyou're gonna find out.
Riley.
Agent Finn, I order you to stop.
Agent Finn.
Riley.
It will be dark soon.
- It would be wise for you to leave Sunnydale.
- I'm not going anywhere.
Not until those bastards undo whatever they did to me, put me back the way I was.
Sure.
Just explain to the nice scientist guys that you miss killing and torturing innocents.
- You think that would work?
- Spike, Lord knows why I'm telling you this.
It's for your own good.
As long as the lnitiative is in operation, it's not safe for you here.
No.
It's not safe for any of us.
So All right, fine.
If she wants a fight, we'll give her one.
Won't we, Adam?
I've worked too long, too long to let some little bitch threaten this project.
Threaten me.
She has no idea who she's dealing with.
Once she's gone, Riley will come around.
He'll understand.
It's for the greater good.
He'll see that.
And if he doesn't Well, first things first.
Remove the complication, and when she least expects it Adam?
Mommy.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
This is your objective.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Demon class: Polgara species.
Bone skewers jut from the creature's forearms during battle.
It's imperative not to damage its arms.
Why can't we damage its arms?
She's an unnecessary risk.
Two of our hostiles broke free and escaped into the tunnels.
- She's dead.
- I don't understand.
Ifyou think that's enough to killme, you really don'tknow whata slayeris.
- If she wants a fight, we'll give her one.
- It's not safe for any of us.
And when she least expects it - Adam.
- Mommy.
Maggie sends me down into the sewers with a blasto gun.
- The next thing I know, it's raining monsters.
- Hallelujah.
And then this gate slams down behind me, and I try to use the gun but it goes "phtt".
You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
She sent me on a one-way recon.
Gotta hand it to you, Goldilocks.
You do have bleeding tragic taste in men.
I got a cousin married to a regurgitating Frovalox demon that's got better instincts.
What does my taste in men have to do with it?
Was Riley knitting bootees for your offspring while Maggie was stringing you up?
You guys think Riley had something to do with this?
Probably not.
But we'd be remiss ifwe didn't think of all the possibilities.
Right.
Remiss.
No.
No.
Maggie made sure that he was nowhere around when she sent me on this "make Buffy dead" assignment.
And plus, Riley?
He seems like he wouldn't tell a little white lie, Iet alone a whole bunch of big, dirty ones.
That's why they call it the secret forces.
Cos they kinda keep the whole lying thing to themselves.
All I know is that Maggie has it in for me.
Which means the lnitiative has it in for me.
The mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the Scooby gang knows that the lnitiative is up to no good.
Which brings us back to the "not safe for any of us" concept.
What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?
I don't know.
She wasn't keen on the fact that I was asking a lot of questions, that's for sure.
- You were getting too close to something.
- Clearly.
Although one can only imagine what she'd be so desperate to hide.
OK, everybody grab a weapon.
We've gotta move.
And storm the lnitiative?
Yeah, let's take on those suckers.
- I was thinking more that we'd hide.
- Thank God.
Buffy, I think perhaps we should talk about this.
We need to relocate some place we're less likely to be found.
We need a plan.
- My place?
- The lnitiative guys know how close we are.
They'll check the places that you hang out.
What about your basement?
The guys haven't seen us together much, and there's room.
- Plus, mirror ball.
- Cool.
- Come and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
- Yes.
Come boogie.
Absolutely not.
I will not squat in that dank hole.
What?
It was good enough for me but you're above it all?
Precisely.
Besides, I don't see why we can't stay right where we are.
I think it's very unlikely those lnitiative boys are gonna come round here to look for Buffy.
God, Buffy.
Are you OK?
- What happened?
- You know?
I know something went down.
Tell me.
Maggie tried to kill me.
It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway.
OK, listen.
I need you to go over everything.
Step by step.
- There has to be some kind of mistake.
- There was no mistake.
- How do you know something happened?
- I was on a mission.
But I came back and I'm not sure.
Look, let's just keep our heads and notjump to any What?
- That's Hostile 17.
- No.
I'm just a friend of Xander's.
Bugger it.
I'm your guy.
This is Spike.
He's It's a really long story.
But he's not bad any more.
What am l?
A bleedin' broken record?
I'm bad.
It's just I can't bite any more.
Thanks to you wankers.
We've been looking for him but you've known where he's been all along?
- It's not like that.
- What is it like?
What's he doing here?
Leaving you swabs to your dramatics, thanks.
I've got my stories on the telly for that.
By the by, ifyou're trying to kill her Buffy, what is this?
You're hiding an HST?
Why don't you back off and let her ask the questions?
Your boss just tried to make monster food outta her.
I didn't see much.
I wasn't there.
All I know is Professor Walsh told me you were dead.
But then I saw you on the monitors This isn't Professor Walsh.
There must be something making her act this way.
Something - I don't know - controlling her.
We think Buffy may have been becoming too inquisitive, that she was getting close to something that Professor Walsh was trying to hide.
- Any idea what that might be?
- What about 314?
Maybe that's it.
Maybe she was trying to test you.
What if it was only a drill?
Then why did she tell you I was dead?
Riley, it wasn't a test.
See, I've heard rumours that the lnitiative isn't all that we've been told, that secretly they're working towards some darker purpose.
- Something that might harm us all.
- No.
That's not what happens there.
- Riley.
- I would know.
No one is sure.
We're just trying to sort it out.
- I'll sort it out on my own.
- Riley.
No.
Just I'm sorry.
What am l?
You're a monster.
I thought so.
- What are you?
- Me?
I'm a boy.
A boy.
- How do you work?
- I don't know, I just do.
What's that for?
Dr Walsh?
Adam?
- That would never happen.
- Well, no, Buff.
That's why they call 'em cartoons, not documentaries.
Must we have the noise?
My head is splitting.
Look who's Cranky Bear in the morning.
Yes, I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.
Every time you moved, it made squeaky noises.
It was irritating.
Really?
I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.
OK, you guys, could we not, please?
Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parents' marriage.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
It'll be OK, Buffy.
Riley's just confused, that's all.
I don't know.
Itjust seems like things could get heavier.
His whole world's falling apart.
And after everything you've been through with Angel.
You know, you really should get yourself a boring boyfriend.
Like Xander.
- You can't have Xander.
- That was the idea.
Riley was supposed to be Mr Joe Guy.
We were gonna do dumb things, like hold hands through the daisies going "tra-la-la".
Poor Buffy.
Your life resists all things average.
So dump him.
But you can't have Xander.
I'll try and remember that.
It's too late, anyway.
I'm already at the "I hurt when he hurts, I smile when he smiles" stage.
- I hate that part.
- I'll just have to make it work.
Turn on the TV.
Now.
Sunnydale is stillreeling from news ofthe crime.
A source in the coroner's office tells us that the boy was stabbed with whatlooks like some kind oflarge skewer, andhis body was then mutilated.
Police have notnameda suspect, and the killeris stillatlarge.
The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm.
That's the one Maggie insisted we bring back alive.
- She must have sent it after you.
- And it got distracted.
God.
Buffy, it's not your fault.
How could you know?
She's right.
You mustn't blame yourself.
I'm not going to.
I'm going to the crime scene to see what I can find out.
Research the Polgara demon.
I wanna know where it is.
I am going to make him pay for taking that kid's life.
I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine.
That would have sounded more commanding if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pyjamas.
Where you been all night?
Well, congratulations.
I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
I wasn't with Buffy.
I needed to be alone.
Think some things through.
- What things?
- Hey, you guys.
This is mighty ominous.
What's up, man?
- Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed.
- What?
Did Buffy tell you that?
- I mean, do you have any proof?
- I saw enough to know it's true.
I don't get it.
Why?
Buffy thinks that she's getting too close, that Professor Walsh has some secret.
I can see Buffy getting on Walsh's bad side.
She puts her nose where it doesn't belong.
- What?
- She's a pain.
"Why this"?
and "Why that"?
- She should die because ofthat?
- I don't know.
Maybe Professor Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad.
Why does it bug you that I hang with her?
Cos she's a better soldier than you?
- She's using you to infiltrate our operations.
- You're saying she's a spy?
You're crazy.
Riley, think about it.
The professor's not stupid.
If she tried to kill Buffy, maybe Buffy needed killing.
Guys.
Not now, Private.
What is it?
Professor Walsh is dead.
Look at that wound.
She's been staked, wouldn't you say, brother?
- What?
- Only one person who could do that.
You better not be saying what I think you're saying.
The Polgara demon has a skewer - That's your girlfriend's MO.
- That's a serious accusation.
- Ready to deal with the consequences?
- Bring 'em on.
That supernatural freak has blinded you.
Stand back, man.
Show some respect.
Listen, everybody's upset, but arguing isn't gonna help anything.
And it's certainly not what Professor Walsh would want.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Good.
Now, Washington is sending in a team to do an internal investigation.
- I've been told we have to wait for their word.
- Wait?
This has to be the work ofthe Polgara demon.
Probably.
Looks like last night the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72.
- It's out loose?
- I'm afraid so.
- Then we go after it.
- My orders from Washington are for a total lockdown until they arrive.
I'm sorry.
Now, return to your quarters.
There's nothing you can do here.
Listen, Angleman can talk all he wants, but I'm still in charge till the brass gets here.
I say we got a demon to hunt.
Now suit up for armed patrol.
And by that I mean loaded guns.
Target practice is over.
We're going for blood.
Let's go.
Let's move.
Quick to one side.
Establish a perimeter.
Somebody's been stayin' here.
What do you think, a homeless guy?
Could be.
Or a squatter ofthe demon variety.
Not the Polgara.
Who cares?
I see a demon, it dies.
It's warm.
Damn.
Animals.
Buffy.
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.
I know that everyone came on pretty strong.
And the Spike thing isn't as tweaked as it looked.
OK, maybe it is, but there's an explanation that almost makes sense.
Hello?
I'm apologising here.
And I think that's pretty big of me, considering I'm the one who was almost made a demon sandwich.
This is the part where you throw me a bone.
Maggie's dead.
Happy now?
How can you ask me that?
Of course I'm not happy.
What happened?
- That's classified.
- Classifi The Polgara.
It got her and escaped, didn't it?
I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find it and destroy it.
And then you can stop asking me how happy all this death makes me.
Howdy.
I just got your message a minute ago.
I was in class, but I was about to call you.
I had so much fun the other night.
Those spells.
Yeah, that was nice.
I hope you don't think that I just come over for the spells and everything.
I mean, I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff.
I know that.
But you wanna do a spell.
Yeah.
But only because it's really important.
There's this No, you don't have to explain.
I don't mind.
Really.
I've been thinking about that last spell we did all day.
You have?
Well, this one should be really fun, too.
We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy in the area.
- It shouldn't be too tricky.
- The goddess Thespia?
- Are you sure we're ready for that?
- You and me?
This is beneath us.
OK, ifyou say so.
- You're killin' me here.
- Missed you, too.
The joint's jumpin'.
You know.
I'm making some changes with my life.
I'm getting away from my old image.
- As a double-dealing snitch?
- You think I'm blowing smoke, but after those apocalypse demons nearly did me in, I had a spiritual experience.
That's swell, but have you heard anything about a Polgara demon doing some killings?
See, that's the thing.
I don't talk behind people's backs no more.
And I'm bringing some class to the joint.
It's Willy's Place.
Brings in a better clientele.
I got one ofthose deep fryers.
These demons just go crazy for chicken fingers.
Ifthey see me dealing with you, I'm just the same Willy, working both sides ofthe street.
- I'm gonna have to punch you.
- Just once, and it don't have to hurt.
- Not yet.
I haven't touched you.
- Sorry.
Right.
Right.
Go ahead.
Wait.
No.
I can't talk to you What have you heard about the Polgara?
Heard there was one around a week or two back.
Word was you got him, you and those army guys.
- And that was the last you heard?
- Yeah.
As far as I know, he's offthe streets.
What about those army guys?
You heard anything about 314?
What are you doing here?
Following me?
You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon.
I thought I'd help.
But now I see you're not hunting demons, you're socialising with them - again.
I thought you were supposed to be killing these things, not buying them drinks.
Smooth, Officer Riley.
They teach you those undercover moves in Special Forces?
- I'm serious.
What are you doing here?
- Just coolin' her dog, like the rest of us.
- Why don't you sit down, relax?
- I want you to tell me.
Who are you?
How about some chicken fingers on the house?
- Shut up.
- I'm just saying I said shut up.
Or maybe you'd like to go back to the lab with me.
I'm sure the coats would love to classify a whatever you are.
Leave him alone, Riley.
He's human.
- So he's human.
- You're shaking.
He just harbours demons.
Which makes him a good guy like you?
- The truth, Buffy.
Now.
- You have it.
You are just too screwed up because ofwhat happened to Walsh to see it.
Let go.
Hold it.
You.
No leaving till I say so.
Got it?
We got new rules here.
No killing.
Right, except the rules don't seem to apply much these days, do they?
Like if I shot you right now, I don't know if I'd have a corpse on my hands - or one pissed-off vampire.
- Riley.
I mean, who do you believe?
First it sounds like lies, then it sounds like truth.
Riley.
What's happening to me?
Riley, why don't you lie down?
You'll be more comfortable.
Stop it.
I can't.
It's like something's crawling inside.
No.
You're hurting yourself.
Come here.
OK.
I thought I knew, but I don't.
I don't know anything.
- You're sick.
Once you get some rest - No.
Buffy I don't know anything.
I don't know which team I'm on.
Who the bad guys are.
Maybe I'm the bad guy.
Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
No.
Don't you even think that.
OK, listen to me.
You're sick.
You just need to get some sleep.
Please.
Lie down for me.
Come on.
You're gonna be OK.
- How is he?
- This isn'tjust grief making him act this way.
Something's affecting him physically and it's getting worse.
- You think Walsh did something to him?
- I don't know, but I'm ready to find out.
- Tough, with Maggie's deadness and all.
- She must have kept records somewhere.
About Riley, about 314, about all of it.
And she wasn't the only person that knew what she was up to.
- So what's the plan?
- Giles, Anya, keep researching.
Xander, you and I are going undercover.
Remember before?
No Xander.
Not in a boyfriend way or a "Iead him to a certain death" way.
- He's the only one with military experience.
- It's not like he was in the Nam.
- He was GI Joe for one night.
- It's OK, Anya.
I've backed up Buffy before.
Can't you do something else to help them?
Like Xerox hand-outs or something?
I'll be careful.
Promise.
How do you plan to get into the lnitiative?
I'm sure their security system's impenetrable.
I have my clearance.
I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.
Well, as for the whereabouts ofthis Polgara demon, I'm afraid we've not turned up much.
- No reports since its original capture.
- Then we'll just have to keep looking.
So, the square is Sunnydale?
Right.
It's like a map.
We both take different parts ofthe potion, and when we do the incantation, we both blow it onto the square at the exact same time.
- But how does it work?
- Well, that's the cool part.
When the potion mixes and Thespia's called, it creates this mist over the parts where the demons are.
It even makes different colours for different breeds.
Wow.
You ready?
Let's do it.
Thespia, we walk in shadow.
Walk in blindness.
You are the protector ofthe night.
Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness, we implore you, open a window to the world ofthe underbeing.
With your knowledge, may we go in safety.
With your grace, may we speak ofyour benevolence.
Or not.
- Seems pretty quiet.
- Usually is this time of Buff, maybe you should check the look later.
- What'd you do that for?
- Sorry.
I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.
- I don't wanna see that.
- Retinal scan, Xander.
Well, we'll know in a few seconds if my clearance is still good.
Or ifwe're about die at the hands of 50 military goons.
Retinalscan recorded.
Summers, Buffy.
Why am I not entirely comforted by the arrival ofthe man-sized microwave?
Holy moly.
I know.
I totally get it now.
Can I have sex with Riley, too?
- Pretend to make out with me.
- What are you talking about?
Well, l you know, in the movies, the guy and the girl have to hide.
Please.
Could you possibly draw more attention to us?
This is the lnitiative.
Military guys and scientists do not make out with each other.
Maybe that's what's wrong with the world.
Ever think about that?
I totally failed.
It wasn't even like the spell went wrong.
Itjust wouldn't.
If it's any consolation, we haven't fared much better here.
- Really?
ls Riley OK?
- Well, he's asleep.
Finally.
But he doesn't look good.
And the research is troubling as well.
I mean, this demon we're after seems highly atypical for a Polgara.
This child it killed was mutilated.
There's no recorded cases of a Polgara having done that.
Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours.
With the low IQ, you have a demon who's not exactly low-profile.
So how has he been hiding out in Sunnydale for two days without anyone seeing him?
Exactly.
- Riley.
- Where's Buffy?
She went out.
Can I get you something?
- Just tell me where she is.
- You're not well, Riley.
You need to rest.
Did she find the Polgara?
ls that it?
- No, we're still looking, but - But what?
She went to find out what's making you sick.
I'm not sick.
You're telling me she went to the lnitiative?
- Riley, she's just trying to help you.
- She doesn't belong there.
Riley, listen - Stand away from the stairs.
- No.
You're gonna get Buffy killed.
You all right?
How many ofthe men are still out?
The longer they go without their meds - Everyone's offtheir schedules.
- It's dangerous.
I don't wanna think about the damage our guys could do in withdrawal.
They won't understand what's happening to them.
They don't know they've been getting meds in their food, so we'd better get them in here.
We've located all but a few.
The last ones were in bad shape, but we stabilised them.
But Finn wasn't one ofthem, right?
Find him.
He's the one I care about.
- He's too important to the work to lose now.
- Indeed.
Double shot of O neg, 'keep.
Make it the good stuff.
I don't want no freakin' orang-utan.
Got ya.
Been a pisser of a day.
Those army blokes are on the tear.
They ran me outta my place.
And all over town.
Yeah, what's up?
Keep me posted.
I'll be in records.
I don't generally like to kill humans, but I've learned it pays to be flexible.
- I was wondering when you'd turn up.
- Darn.
So this isn't a surprise?
Now, you can tell me what you did to Riley and after that we can take a tour of room 314.
Somebody's coming, you know.
They've already seen you on the security monitors.
Monitors are nonfunctional at this time, sir.
- Went down about ten minutes ago.
- What?
I didn't do that.
Thank God for small favours and we'll worry about details later.
Finn, take this girl to the stockade immediately.
Riley, he can tell us what we need to know.
Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?
She did.
But understand, the lnitiative has no interest in eliminating the Slayer.
- It was her own vendetta.
- Why?
Spell it out for me.
- I feel a "dumb blonde" attack coming on.
- I don't know.
Well, think harder.
It was the project.
Project?
314.
It - It escaped.
- That's enough.
You're making her sound like some psychopath.
She wasn't like that.
- She was a brilliant woman.
- She was.
It's not She tried to help people.
This is the way you want them to remember her?
- Walsh was feeding you drugs.
- You're doing this to me.
- This all started because ofyou.
- Just listen.
- I am trying to help you get to the truth.
- You want truth?
Then tell me.
- What did you do to her, Buffy?
- Stop it.
I didn't do anything.
Riley, stop.
This isn't about us.
Everything that we need to know is here.
We just need to find out what was in 314.
Me.
I've been thinking about the world.
I wanted to see it.
Learn it.
I saw the inside ofthat boy and it was beautiful.
But it didn't tell me about the world.
Itjust made me feel.
So now I want to learn about me.
Why I feel.
What I am.
So I came home.
I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid, designed by Maggie Walsh.
She called me Adam and I called her Mother.
Adam, Maggie would want you to stand down.
Yes.
But I seem to have a design flaw.
In addition to organic material, I'm equipped with GP2D11 infrared detectors, a harmonic decelerator, plus DC servo.
She pieced you together from parts of other demons.
And man.
And machine.
Which tells me what I am, but not who I am.
Mother wrote things down.
Hard data, but also her feelings.
That's how I learned that I have ajob here.
And that she loved me.
She wasn't your mother.
And she didn't love you.
- Is that really the issue?
- She made you because she was a scientist.
Riley.
Riley Finn.
Stop.
Those files - Mother created you, too.
- Maggie is not my mother.
- I have a mother.
A real - A birth mother, yes.
But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system.
She taught you how to think, how to feel.
She fed you chemicals to make you stronger.
Your mind and body.
She said that you and I were her favourite children.
Her art.
That makes us brothers.
Family.
No.
I'm not like you.
That's pain, isn't it?
Why?
Because your feeding schedule, the chemicals, have been interrupted?
Or do you miss her?
Tell me.
- I'll kill you.
- You won't.
- You haven't been programmed to.
- I cannot be programmed.
I'm a man.
It's here.
The plan she had for us.
What happens.
- How it ends.
- No.
- Do you want to hear?
- No.
Doctor.
Thank you.
This has been very interesting.
Back away from the door!
Riley, are you OK?
Secure the room.
We got a demon in here.
It escaped through that vent.
It's not the Polgara.
It looks sort of half man.
- Right, and you just happened to be here.
- She's telling the truth.
I saw it.
It killed Angleman.
Go.
Now.
Yes, sir.
- He needs to go to a hospital.
- We'll take it from here.
- I'm going with him.
- A military hospital.
- No.
- Back off.
We take care of our own around here, understand?
Buffy.
Escort them out.
Buffy.
What did you expect, Spike?
A welcome party?
Word's out.
You've been making war on the demon world.
- War?
- With the Slayer.
You kill other demons, and the rest of us don't hold with that.
Still, if I see you around here again, I'll be inclined to break that code.
Do you understand?
No word from Riley?
Nothing.
The lnitiative probably has him locked in some medical ward.
I can't get near him until I have a better plan than just storming in and getting us all shot.
Yeah, you might wanna work the kinks out ofthat one.
What am I gonna do?
He needs me and I can't get near him.
You'll find a way.
I can't spend all of my energy going after the lnitiative.
Not while Adam's out there.
He's really that big of a threat?
I could barely fight him.
It was like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior.
He's smart and fast.
He gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.
There's gotta be a flaw.
I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight.
I never should have let them take Riley.
I need to be with him.
- I'm sure he's OK.
- There's no way he can be.
Everything he's ever believed in has been taken away or He's alone.
He has nothing to hold on to.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I'm Faith.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Open your present.
- This is a thing of beauty, boss.
- That look on your face is my reward.
We've a rogue slayer on ourhands.
I can't think ofanything more dangerous.
It's a wonder she's alive at all with the blood loss.
There's almost no chance that she's ever gonna regain consciousness.
You're really strong.
I like it.
I've worked too long Too long to let some little bitch threaten this project.
Maggie Walsh set you up?
Maggie wantedme dead, didn'tshe?
Adam?
Mommy.
Why does it bug you that I hang with her?
- She's using you to infiltrate our operation.
- You're saying she's a spy?
I don't know which team I'm on.
Who the bad guys are.
Escort them out.
Buffy.
They smell good, don't they?
- What?
- Clean sheets.
Like summer.
I wouldn't know.
Right.
I forgot.
I noticed.
- I wish I could stay, but - No, you have to go.
- It's just with - Little sis coming.
I know.
So much to do before she gets here.
- Now I really have to - So go.
Don't let me keep Damn.
Just when we made it so nice.
Are you ever gonna take this thing out?
So, here it is.
The latest in state-of-the-art combat technology.
It doesn't look that complicated.
- So can you repair it?
- Sure.
As soon as I get my masters degree in Advanced Starship Technology.
Why don't we experiment?
Press some buttons, see what happens.
- I'd like to veto that.
- Second.
It's called a "blaster", Will.
A word that tends to discourage experimentation.
If it were called the "orgasmator", I'd try your button-press approach.
- Just tell me.
Can you repair it or not?
- I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it.
If I blow a hole in my mom's azalea patch, the neighbours will not be pleased.
You all right?
You've been patrolling round the clock for three days straight.
- Perhaps you could use some - What?
Some rest?
There's a demonoid killing machine out there that doesn't only work the night shift.
I was going to say perhaps you could use some backup.
But now you mention it, gathering your strength might not be a bad idea.
Just get the blaster working.
That's all the strength I need.
Are you sure?
Why?
Because ray guns aren't in the Slayer Handbook?
Will, you haven't seen this Adam thing.
He's the Terminator without the bashful charm.
He's deadly, and the last time we met he kicked my ass.
Oh, no.
Blast away, by all means.
I only meant No word about Riley?
They keep telling me that he's fine.
That's all they'll say.
- Maybe they're telling the truth.
- Maybe.
I don't know what the lnitiative's version of "fine" is.
They could be forcing him onto medication and torturing him, for all I know.
From what we've seen, I doubt they'd try to hurt him.
The only thing I know is that my boyfriend is locked away and I'm not helping.
Maybe Giles has a point.
Riley is their Top Gun guy.
Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him.
The lnitiative has all those brainwashy behaviour-modification guys.
So?
What happens when they don't like his behaviour?
Stand down, soldier.
Stand down before I put you down.
You heard the man.
At ease.
The shish kebab that walks like a man.
Looks like you're feelin' better.
Walkin' around, threatening people.
Man was in my way.
I got places to be.
Really?
And where were you thinking of going?
You know where I'm goin'.
Don't tell me you're headed toward your girlfriend.
Look at you.
One good conjugal visit and you're back in lntensive Care to stay.
- You wouldn't understand.
- How about you explain it to me?
- We all friends here, fellas?
- Absolutely.
Riley is about to explain why he's leaving us.
I don't explain, because I don't have to.
I'm the one in charge.
- Things change.
- Do they?
In case you failed to notice, we're in a world of hurt here.
It's time to band together, not go off our separate ways.
- Forrest has a point, Rye.
- We have a problem, we deal with it.
The most important part ofthe equation is that we keep said problem within the family.
Family?
Is that what we are?
Step aside.
You think it's gonna rain?
Nonsense.
It's a beautiful day.
Eat your sandwich.
I don't know, it's just it always seems like it starts raining right about now.
You're too young and too pretty a girl to start wearing worry lines on your face.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Hey there, little fella.
I don't know where you belong, but it's not here with us.
There you go.
You see, there's nothing gonna spoil our time together.
Who wants cheesecake?
No!
I told you I had things to do.
- Spread out?
- Not too far.
So not a problem.
I've never seen anything like that.
And I can go a long, healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.
- It had to be Adam who killed it.
But why?
- He's studying biology.
Human, demon, whatever he can get his hands on.
- Learning what makes things work.
- I don't wanna be around for the final exam.
It's not coming to that.
The lnitiative created this and they can't stop it.
But we will.
Question.
Will hiding in a cabin with stockpiled chocolates be part ofthis plan?
No.
Told you.
- What's first?
- Riley.
I'm not leaving him down there with those people.
I don't care how many guns they have, I'm going in.
OK.
Will, I need you to hack into the security mainframe and buy me a ten-minute shutdown of systems.
- That could be - Tricky.
Not impossible.
Ifyou can't do it online, then use magic.
Xander, I want any gear you've been saving for a rainy day.
- Stealthy stuff?
- No, we tried sneaking in.
This time I'm using force.
I figure I'll go in through the elevator shaft, then blast open the doors and find the infirmary.
Am I really worth all that?
Riley!
God, I'm sorry!
Did I hurt you?
No, a giant skewer through the ribcage hurt me.
That was just a reminder.
- How did you get out?
- I walked.
- They didn't try to stop you?
- Oh, they did.
Repeatedly.
But I told them they couldn't keep me without a major ass-kicking, one way or another.
- Here I am.
- That's great, Riley.
You know, there's no polite way to ask you this, but Did they put a chip in your brain?
- Beg your pardon?
- Forget it.
We're just happy to have you back.
Yeah.
We were pretty worried about you for a while, mister.
Me too.
Hey, look, I know my behaviour was pretty out there.
Forget it.
Tell you what.
You two crazy kids take down an unstoppable killer-cyborg-demon hybrid thingy and we'll call it all even.
Taking down Adam will be tough.
There's no way to predict what he'll throw at us.
You're here.
Whatever comes, we can handle.
Excuse me?
You know how to get to third floor west from here?
What?
I see - You need some help or something?
- Graduation.
- What?
- Graduation.
I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation, now.
Well, you can't.
Sunnydale High School isn't even there any more.
- What day is it?
- Friday.
- What date?
The date?
- February 25th.
What year?
- Maybe I should get a nurse - What happened to the school?
- Don't you just wanna - Just tell me.
Well It was a tragedy, really.
Lots of students died.
The principal, the mayor I really think maybe I should get you some help.
You know, lneverstopped thinking aboutyou.
Me neither.
All I had in there was this one little part ofyou.
It's just the scarf part of me, really.
I'm serious.
Just knowing you were out there.
That you cared.
You think we're bein' watched?
I don't know.
Does the lnitiative do that?
Maybe.
You seem a little somewhere else.
Is there anything I can do?
Give me an order.
It's what I do, isn't it?
Follow orders.
- You don't have to.
- Don't l?
All my life that's what I've been groomed to do.
They sayjump, I ask "How high"?
I get the job done.
Just don't know if it's the rightjob any more.
I know how you feel.
Giles used to be a part ofthis Council, and for years all they ever did was give me orders.
- Ever obey them?
- Sure.
The ones I was going to do anyway.
The point is I quit the Council.
And I was scared.
But it's OK now.
That's where you and I are different.
I just suck at the whole grey-area thing.
It's a choice.
You can go back in there and maybe make some changes from the inside.
Or you can quit the team, fight demons in your own way.
You make it sound so simple.
I don't even know what my way is.
Well, it's time to find out.
I'm a soldier.
Take that away, what's left?
A good man.
- What are you doing?
- I am looking for brainwashy chips in your head.
- Finding any?
- Not sure.
But I should probably keep looking just in case.
You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn.
I'm gonna help you.
And we're gonna find this demon, and we're gonna kill it together.
And in the meantime, you are gonna stop torturing yourself.
Sure about that?
It's an order.
- What do you mean, she just wasn't there?
- I don't know.
I came to check the monitors, like I always do at eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock is my shift.
I got here on time - The bed was in this condition?
- Haven't touched a thing.
Get the duty rosters, check the log.
I wanna know what happened.
- Coma patients do notjust walk away.
- We are checking every room on every floor.
Walk me through this one more time.
You knew she was wanted for questioning in a series of murders.
- There's no security here?
- You don't understand.
There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
This can't be happening.
- Did you find her?
- Another woman.
Unconscious and beaten.
And she's been stripped.
It's happened.
Send the team.
The puzzle is why Adam has stayed dormant this long.
When he's not making performance art out of other demons.
He's probably working off an autonomic power source.
Because he's straight out ofthe box, he needs to charge up.
- OK.
What's he charging up for?
- Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree.
And that's a best-case scenario.
I suppose a little fire power would be a good idea right now.
Hey!
How did you do that?
- Is there an on/off button somewhere?
- Blasters are easy.
Adam won't be.
Since Professor Walsh designed it, any chance she left instructions lying around?
- If she did, they'll be in the lnitiative.
- Which we can't easily get into.
Speak for yourself.
- I'm just sayin'.
- A man on the inside would be A really good idea.
Are you sure you wanna be Double Agent Guy?
I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me, but I will share information.
- It's the least I can do.
- Riley's right.
It is the least he can do.
Hello.
Yes, she is.
It's for you.
Hello?
Speaking.
What sort of emergency?
No.
I haven't.
Thank you.
I'll let you know.
What is it?
It's Faith.
She's awake.
She beat someone up, took her clothing, and disappeared out ofthe hospital.
No one knows where she is.
I'd say this qualifies for a "worst timing ever" award.
- What do we do?
- Well, we have to find her.
What about Adam?
I'd hate the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic to prevent pursuing a homicidal lunatic.
Faith's not exactly Low Profile Girl.
I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move.
- But then what?
- Ooh, I have an idea.
- Beat the crap out of her.
- Good plan.
Good on paper.
But we still have a decision to make.
Do we hand her over to the cops?
They wouldn't know what to do with a slayer.
- What about the Council?
- Been there.
Tried that.
Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm, as I recall.
Well, the lnitiative has containment facilities.
- One word: evil.
- There's no way around it.
Faith is back and, whether I like it or not, she's my responsibility.
Yeah, too bad.
That was the funnest coma ever.
We have no idea where she is.
We don't know what she's thinking, what she's feeling - Who she's doing.
- She could be terrified.
Maybe she doesn't even remember.
Or maybe she does and she's sorry, and she's alone, hiding somewhere.
Perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation we just haven't thought about.
And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B. I'm not gonna rule it out.
First thing, we need to find her.
Then we can take it from there.
Who's Faith?
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.
She's my wacky cousin from England, and whenever she visits high jinks ensue.
It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
No, I told him the story.
I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies.
That's fair.
How'd you handle the Angel-y parts?
I did some editing.
It's not that I want to hide anything from Riley.
It's just that that's a longer conversation and I had a Faith hunt to do.
- Any luck?
- Couldn't find her.
Don't know where to place that in the luck continuum.
At least you're not alone on this.
I'll bet every cop in Sunnydale is looking for her right now.
Pressure is definitely high.
I'll tell you, if I were her, I'd get out of Dodge posthastey.
You're not me.
So, check you out, B. Nice.
The big-girl-on-campus thing's really working for you.
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been standing still for eight months, B. How hard did you look?
- Are you all right?
- Five by five.
That's the thing about a coma.
You wake up rested and rejuvenated and ready for payback.
- So much for pleasantries, huh?
- What did you think?
We'd go for tea?
- You tried to gut me, Blondie.
- You'd have done the same to me.
So let's have another go at it.
See who lands on top.
- It doesn't have to be like this, you know.
- Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this.
- Faith, these are innocent people.
- No such animal.
I guess it was too much to hope that you'd use your downtime to reflect and grow.
Could say the same about you.
You're still the same old "better than thou" Buffy.
I knew it.
I kept having this dream, I'm not sure what it means.
But in the dream this self-righteous blonde chick stabs me.
- And you wanna know why?
- You had it coming.
That's one interpretation.
But in my dream, she does it for a guy.
Try it, Red, and you lose an arm!
I wake up to find that this blonde chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about.
She's moved on to the first college beefstick she meets.
Not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, she's forgotten all about the chick she nearly killed for him.
So that's my dream.
That and some stuff about cigars and a tunnel.
But, tell me, college girl, - what does it mean?
- To me?
Mostly, that you still mouth off about things you don't understand.
Uh-oh.
I guess somebody knows you're here.
You took my life, B. Payback's a bitch.
- Look who's talking.
- See ya around.
Thanks for coming with.
Hunting for a psychopathic superbitch is in the above-and-beyond category.
It's OK.
Really.
So what do we do ifwe find her?
Run.
Flee.
Maybe skedaddle.
We're not here to engage.
This is strictly recon.
- What?
- You said recon.
- You're, like, Cool Monster Fighter.
- Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster.
And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky to bruise her fist with my face.
- Oh.
- What?
Face punching.
I'm not so good with the whole Swimming?
Violence.
Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first.
She's this cleavagey slutbomb walking around going "Oh, check me out.
I'm wicked cool.
I'm five by five".
Five by five?
Five what by five what?
See, that's the thing.
No one knows.
Buffy can handle Faith, and you're plenty safe with me.
So we recon till nightfall?
Then the ritual hiding begins.
The point being, I could be the target here.
Faith finds Mr Xander Harris still in town, odds are she goes tighter than catgut.
Got a lotta pent-up feelings there.
- I'm only sayin'.
- Yes, I'm sure.
See, I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on women.
No.
Faith and I have this thing between us called history.
- Spike.
- What are you doing here?
Me?
Hey, I'm not the one out of place here.
For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue slayer on our hands.
- Real psycho killer, too.
- Sounds serious.
- It is.
What do you know?
- What do you need?
Her.
Dark hair.
Yea tall.
- Name of Faith.
Criminally insane.
- Have you seen her?
- Is this bird after you?
- In a bad way.
Yeah.
Tell you what I'll do, then.
I'll head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where you are, and watch as she kills you.
Can't any one ofyour damned Scooby club at least try to remember that I hate you all?
Just because I can't do the damage doesn't stop me aiming a loose cannon your way.
And I thought the evening would be dull.
Go ahead!
You wouldn't even recognise her.
Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith, criminally insane I like this girl already.
We're dumb.
Faith!
A friend sent me.
I got a little remembrance from him.
Hello, Faith.
Ifyou're watching this tape, it can onlymean one thing: I'm dead.
And ournoble campaign to bring order to the town ofSunnydale has failed, utterlyand completely.
But on the otherhand, heck, maybe we won!
Andrightnowl'm on somejumbo monitor in the Richard Wilkins Museum, surroundedbya bunch ofkids looking up atmyface, filled with fearand wonder.
Hi, kids!
But the realistin me tends to doubtit.
Now, Faith, as lrecord this message, you're sleeping.
And the doctors tellme thatyou mightnever wake up.
I don'tbelieve that.
Sooner orlater, you will wake up.
Andyou'll find the worldhas gone and changed on you.
I wish I couldmake the world a betterplace foryou to wake up in, but, tough as itis to accept, we both have to understand that even mypower to protect and watch overyou has its limits.
See, the hardpill to swallowhere is that, once I'm gone, your days arejustplain numbered.
Now, lknowyou're a smartand capable young woman in charge ofher own life.
But the problem, Faith, is that there won'tbe a place foryou in the worldanymore.
Rightnow, lbet you're feeling verymuch alone.
Butyou're neveralone.
You'llalways have me.
And you'llalways have this.
Go ahead.
Open the box.
Don't worry.
It's notgonna bite.
That's myjob.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Surprise!
See, you don'tget these in anygumballmachine.
When you're aroundas long as me, you make friends.
Some ofthem forge neatlittle gizmos like the one you're holding rightnow.
Andhere's the goodnews.
Justbecause it's overformyFaith doesn'tmean she can'tgo out with a bang.
She's a very dangerous woman.
OK, I get it, really.
Faith bad.
- Do I look like I'm arguing?
- Not yet.
You always make that innocent face right before you start.
Figured that out, huh?
Damn.
Took Mom 12 years to catch that one.
All I'm saying is, ifyou're in trouble, I wanna help.
- You can't.
- Give me one reason why.
That's one.
OK.
I'm not exactly Action Guy.
But there's gotta be somethin' I can do besides wait for you to pummel this gal.
Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a gal proves you don't know her.
I've never seen anybody get under your skin this way.
- What did she do to you exactly?
- It's a long story.
I'm from lowa.
We drive four hours for a high-school football game.
Try me.
I told you, OK?
She hurt me and people that I care about.
- Did I mention psycho killer?
- There's something you're not telling me.
Riley, I have to go.
She's out there.
All right.
I'm just sayin', I think you're holdin' out on me.
Riley, this isn't ajoke.
There's a criminally insane woman out there with superpowers, who thinks that I'm responsible for ruining her life.
I know Faith.
She'll come after me and she'll come after the people that I love.
Hi, Joyce.
Mind if I come in?
Ruby Sunset.
Burgundy Skyline.
Harlot?
Way to go, Joyce.
Normally I wouldn't go with a colour this dark, but I read in a magazine eight months in a coma will damage a girl's natural skin tone.
Good thing pale is in this year.
Or was it last year?
Anyway, for real now.
I'm gonna ask you something, and you gotta promise to be honest and not spare my feelings just cos I could kill you.
You promise?
- I promise.
- OK.
How do I look?
- Psychotic.
- I was shooting for sultry, but hey.
- Bet I know what you're thinking.
- Really?
You're thinking "You'll never get away with this"!
Warm?
Actually, I was thinking my daughter will kill you soon.
- That a fact?
- More like a bet.
Whoa.
You got a pair on you, Joyce.
I like seein' that in a woman your age.
Guess you can afford to talk that way.
In Joyce's world, Buffy is gonna come crashing through that door any minute.
But look what I found.
Buffy Summers.
Buffy Summers.
Buffy Summers.
Buffy, Buffy A lot of letters.
She hasn't been by in a while, huh?
And you'd think, with a crazy chick like me on the loose, crazy chick with a wicked grudge against her, she'd call and give you a heads-up.
But Buffy's too into her own deal to remember dear old Mom.
You don't know the first thing about Buffy.
Or me.
Don't l?
I know what it's like.
You think you matter, you're a part of something, and you get dumped.
It's like the whole world is moving, but you're stuck.
Like those animals in the tarpits.
It's like you just keep sinking a little deeper every day, and nobody even sees.
Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?
Don't tell me you don't see it, Joyce.
You've served your purpose.
You squirted out the kid, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead.
Nobody cares.
Nobody remembers.
Especially not Buffy, fabulous superhero.
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to face it.
She was over us a long time ago, Joyce.
Too busy climbing onto her new boy toy to give a thought to the people that matter!
You're her mother, and she just leaves you here to die!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
You thought I'd go after the clean marine.
He's a cutie.
Looks like he could use a good roll in the sack.
You're not his type.
He's not big on sleaze.
- He's probably never tried it.
- Going for the boyfriend again?
That's tired.
Just something to remember me by once I've moved on.
Ever occur to you, Faith, that the reason we all forgot you is because we wanted to?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
The project.
It escaped.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": The lnitiative created this.
They can't stop it, but we will.
It's Faith.
She's awake.
- Are you all right?
- Five by five.
Open the box.
Surprise!
- You sure you're OK?
- Five by five.
We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of hospital.
- What'll happen to her?
- We'll get her checked out.
- If she's stable, she goes to jail, pending trial.
- I just hope she gets some kind of help.
The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
You'll be safe now.
We may have a couple of questions in the morning.
- Of course.
- Thank you, both.
- I'm glad we finally got the kid.
- She's not a kid.
- I just mean that she's very strong.
- Yeah.
This Faith chick?
Definitely dangerous.
She truly is.
Faith.
Why do you think she's like that?
Well, you know.
She's a nutjob.
I don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behaviour.
How do you know she got drove?
- I mean, maybe she likes being that way.
- I'll never believe that.
I think she's horribly unhappy.
Well, could be things are lookin' up.
A little stint in the poky, show her the error of her ways.
I'm sure there's some big old bertha waitin' to shower her ripe little selfwith affection.
Buffy.
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's just when I think about how she might've hurt you, I just I can't stand it.
Sorry.
No, I'm just sore from the fight.
- I've missed you.
- Cos I haven't visited, right?
I knew it.
I know how it is.
You've got so much in your life now.
- I'm a busy little beaver.
College and all.
- Of course.
But maybe we could spend some time together soon?
Some night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.
Count on it.
I'm gonna take a bath.
Why, yes, I would be Buffy.
May I help you?
Buffy.
You can't do that.
It's wrong.
You can't do that because it's naughty.
Because it's wrong.
Because it's wrong.
You can't do that.
It's wrong.
I'll kick your ass.
I'm gonna kill you.
- Let me go!
- Get me a sedative, now!
- Hold her.
- I have to go home.
She's with my mother!
- No!
- Just lie still.
- You don't understand.
- Keep holding her.
She's taken my body.
- I wonder where she is.
- Who, Faith?
Yeah.
I wish she would make a move.
She's making my stomach all acidy.
But you think Buffy can handle her?
I think so.
But that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
Well, you should be safe.
Nobody knows you're here.
I mean, they don't even know I exist, right?
I know all about them, but I mean, that's totally cool.
I mean, it's good.
It's better.
Tara, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you.
It's just Well, Buffy's, like, my best friend and she's really special.
And there's this whole bunch of us and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying.
And I really want you to meet them.
But I just kinda like having something that's just, you know, mine.
And I usually don't use so many words to say stuffthat little, but do you get it at all?
I do.
I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.
I am, you know.
What?
Yours.
Not too bad.
Score.
..
six, four, four, seven.
Expiration, 5/01.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Just getting my mail.
That was Giles on the other line.
He wanted you to meet your friends there.
Said he had news.
Yeah.
I got some time to kill.
I'll go see the gang.
All my friends.
- You don't mind if I steal this?
- Is that the Harlot?
- Yeah.
- That's the same one Faith picked.
Burn it.
She's coming to.
Man, I want this kid's constitution.
Faith.
Move it.
I wanna get her in before she's 100%.
By order ofthe Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time Skip the speech.
Let's go.
Buffy.
Good.
The Scooby gang's all here.
Willow, Xander and everybody.
- What's up?
- It's about Faith, not surprisingly.
Didn't Joyce tell you?
I already kicked that ass.
- I feel a high-five comin' on.
- Where is she?
On her way to the big house.
Cops took her off my hands an hour ago.
Poetic justice.
How's that?
Well, she did all those crimes and now she's being arrested.
I guess that's just regularjustice.
It's cool, anyway.
Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.
What are you talking about?
The Watcher's Council.
They sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
Well, yeah, cos it worked so well when Wesley tried it.
This is a special operations unit.
They handle the Council's trickierjobs: - smuggling, interrogation, wet works.
- What's wet works?
- Scuba-type stuff.
- I thought it was murder.
Well, yeah.
But there could be underwater murder, with snorkels.
- So they're taking her to England?
- It'll be a long, long time before she returns.
I'm sorry.
It's just - I'm happy.
Faith is evil.
- Yeah.
I hope they throw the book at her.
- I'm not sure there is a book for this.
- They could throw other things.
- I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
- After what she's done to you?
I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her.
If I was larger and had grenades.
I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
- So you're saying everything's fine?
- Yes.
I'm glad you called us here because that information can never be conveyed by phone.
- What's up?
- I just thought it was best to convene I'd never let her hurt you.
- I know.
- But ifyou're keen to go, - please, by all means, go.
- We kinda have a romantic evening planned.
We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.
- We don't wanna cut into that seven minutes.
- Hey.
I believe that's my "hey".
Hey!
Lighten up.
We're outta danger.
- Everything's good.
- We still have Adam to take care of.
Yeah.
Adam.
- What's up with him?
- I wish we knew.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll patrol tonight as long as it takes.
You guys have your fun.
I'll be out there doing myjob.
You.
And you.
What?
Are you keepin' tabs on me?
You gonna give me a hard time now?
- Do I usually give you a hard time?
- Very funny.
Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking.
Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
- You're a vampire.
- Was.
And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again.
But until then I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree, so why don't you sod off?
OK.
Fine.
Throw it in my face.
Spike's not a threat any more, I'll turn my back.
He can't hurt me.
Spike?
Spike.
William the Bloody with a chip in his head.
I kinda love this town.
God.
You know why I really hate you, Summers?
Cos I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense offun?
Well, yeah.
That covers a lot of it.
Cos I could do anything and instead I choose to pout and feel the burden of slayerness?
I mean, I could be rich.
I could be famous.
I could have anything.
Anyone.
Even you, Spike.
I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up.
I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of.
I could squeeze you until you popped like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more.
And you know why I don't?
Because it's wrong.
I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
Count on it.
It's too crowded.
We gotta hold out for a few hours, pick up a straggler.
Some drunk.
Can't be calling attention to - ourselves.
- I've been thinking.
About vampires.
- This is my place.
- Your place.
Yes.
The sewers.
You hide from them, crawl about in their filth, scavenging like rats.
What do you fear?
Kill this guy already.
You fear the cross, the sun, fire, and, oh, yes - I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
- You can have the place.
- We don't have to stay here any more.
- You fear death.
Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally.
Vampires are a paradox.
OK.
We're a paradox.
That's cool.
Demon in a human body.
You walk in both worlds and belong to neither.
I can relate.
Come.
We have a lot to talk about.
Well, it's awake.
- Who are you?
- Council.
We're taking you back to the mother country.
Seems you've been a naughty girl.
Listen to me.
You've made a mistake.
I am not Faith.
I'm Buffy Summers.
Faith performed some kind of spell.
She switched our bodies.
Congratulations.
No one's ever tried that one on me before.
You have to find Faith.
Call Giles.
Just get him here.
Giles doesn't work for the Council any more.
For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers.
And what you are, miss, is the package.
I deliver the package.
I don't much care what's inside.
Come on.
He may not care, but I do.
The Watcher's Council used to mean something.
You perverted it.
You're trash.
We should have killed you while you were asleep.
I can't believe you've never been here.
The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale.
Of course, there's not a lot of competition.
I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second.
- You used to come here a lot?
- We lived here.
Me, Xander, Buffy?
Wow.
I didn't think she'd be here.
Come on, I want you to meet her.
Back off.
You're nothing but a disappointment.
- Hey, Buffy.
- Willow and - Buffy, this is Tara.
- Hi.
So we've never met?
Cool.
Just having a thing with names.
Tara was in my Wicca group.
So, what's up?
Patrol a no-go?
Got tired.
You know, the whole Faith thing.
I let off some steam.
Good for you.
You shouldn't work yourselftoo hard.
That's my philosophy.
Anyone want a soda?
Water.
So, you guys been hanging out a lot lately?
Yeah.
She's she's really cool.
So Willow's not driving stick any more.
Who would have thought?
I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their skin.
And Oz is out ofthe picture?
I've never seen two people so much in love.
She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.
She said he w-w-w W-w-what?
You gonna get that sentence out some time tonight?
Buffy, guy in the corner.
Yeah.
Good call.
- What?
- Vampire.
It's wicked obvious.
So I should slay him.
- You want help?
- Nah, I got it.
You'll live.
- He was so strong.
- Yeah, well, he's gone now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's cool.
Everything poofed?
All is well in the world.
Tara's not feeling well.
I'm gonna walk her home.
Yeah.
You give her whatever she needs.
Are you gonna be in later, or are you going over to Riley's?
This'll bloody keep you quiet.
How about this?
I'll be quiet and you can scream.
Now, you unchain me very slowly and politely, or I kill this guy.
When we go on ajob we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident.
- Collins!
- Sorry, Smithy.
- She's starting to bother me.
- Getting her across the border'll be trouble.
Ifthe Council can even get us passage.
I'll call 'em.
It's time for a contingency plan.
Hi, baby.
I'm sorry you're feeling all bleghy.
But we'll get together with Buffy another time soon.
I think you'll really like her.
She's not your friend.
I may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor.
No, no.
I mean, I don't I don't think she's her.
- You lost me.
- Well, a person's energy has a flow, a unity.
Buffy's was fragmented.
It grated like something forced in where it doesn't belong.
Plus, she was kind of mean.
So you think Buffy's not herself?
Like she's been possessed or something?
- I'm not sure.
- You didn't sense a hyena energy, did you?
Because hyena possession is just unpleasant.
- Do you have anything of hers?
- Of Buffy's?
This ring.
I think there's a way we can The passage to the Nether Realm.
There's a ritual.
Ifyou can find Buffy there, you should be able to see.
If it'll help her.
What?
The Nether Realm exists beyond the physical world.
Accessing it is kind of like astral projection.
It's very intense.
I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.
- I trust you.
- It's not like anything that we've ever I trust you.
You miss me?
I did, actually.
Everything's OK?
Everything's great.
- What about Faith?
- Faith has won a fabulous trip to England and I got the consolation prize, which is you.
So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up?
Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her.
- Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
- You wouldn't have liked Faith.
She's not proper and joyless, like a girl should be.
She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts.
- Door's open.
- So?
So my fantasies don't include a bunch of marines starin' at me.
Maybe they could learn something.
- You're hurt?
- Not that bad, actually.
The drugs the professor gave me really did make me stronger.
I'm healin' pretty quick.
Maybe we should take you for a test drive.
I wouldn't say no.
So, how do you want me?
- How do l?
- Yeah.
What d'you wanna do with this body?
What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out?
Am I a bad girl?
D'you wanna hurt me?
What are we playin' at here?
I'm Buffy.
OK.
Then I'll be Riley.
- Well, ifyou don't wanna play - Right.
I don't wanna play.
The sightless sea Ayala flows through the river in me The inward eye, the sightless sea Ayala flows through the river in me The inward eye, the sightless sea Ayala flows through the river in me I love you.
Get off.
No.
No.
No.
Get off.
No.
Off me.
- Get off.
- Buffy?
No.
No.
Get Buffy, what?
What's wrong?
Who are you?
What do you want from her?
Should I not have?
This is meaningless.
You're shaking.
What happened?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I have a gift no man has, no demon has ever had.
I know why I'm here.
I was created to kill.
To extinguish life wherever I find it.
And I have accepted that responsibility.
You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift, but it's time to face your fear.
Tell us what to do.
You are here to be my first.
To let them know that I am coming.
- We're ready.
- Then ask yourself: what is it?
More than man.
More than anything else.
What is the thing you fear?
Hope you left him alive.
- What?
- Boy should be on the mend.
- I don't see you lettin' him get much rest.
- Stay out of other people's lives.
We've got a mission.
When Riley could think for himself A mission?
I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
Yeah, you're a killer.
I am not a killer.
I am the Slayer.
- You don't know the first thing about me.
- You really care what I think?
No.
I don't care.
God, I don't care.
They can't get us passage.
They've ordered the kill.
- Torch the place?
- Get the gas.
She could've killed me.
She didn't.
Lucky you.
Weatherby!
Keys, keys.
Stop her, you ponce.
OK.
I'm good at this.
Drive.
OK, there you go.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Giles!
- God!
Don't move.
OK, Giles, you have to listen to me very carefully.
- I'm not Faith.
- Really?
- Really.
- Cos the resemblance is striking.
I know.
Giles, you just have to Stop inching.
You were inching.
- Look, I know what you're going to say and - I'm Buffy.
OK, I didn't know what you were going to say, but you're still crazy.
Faith switched.
I mean, she had some device.
She switched our bodies.
Giles, I swear.
It's me.
Ifyou are Buffy, you'll let me tie you up, without killing me, until we find out whether you're telling the truth.
Giles, Faith has taken my body and, for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now.
I don't have time for bondage fun.
Ask me a question.
Ask me anything.
- Who's President?
- We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.
- Yes.
All right.
- This is Giles, you turned into a demon and I knew it was you.
Can't you just look in my eyes and be all intuitive?
- How did I turn into a demon?
- Cos of Ethan Rayne.
And you have a girlfriend named Olivia.
And you haven't had ajob since we blew up the school, which is valid, lifestyle-wise.
I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but When I had psychic power I heard Mom think you were like a stevedore during sex.
- Do you want me to continue?
- Actually, I beg you to stop.
- What's a stevedore?
- All right.
I need you to explain everything.
And I will, after we get Faith.
- Giles!
- Will.
- Oh, my God.
- Willow, wait.
You don't understand.
You're Buffy.
You and Faith switched bodies through a Katra spell.
She understands it better than I do.
- How did you?
- Tara.
- Tara, this is Buffy.
Only really, this time.
- Hi.
- Tara's a powerful witch.
- Not really.
No, really.
She knew right away you weren't you.
So we connected with the Nether Realms to find out what happened and we conjured this.
- What is?
- It's a Katra.
Or the home-conjured version.
It should switch you back, ifyou can get ahold of Faith.
Thank God.
I'll get it.
- Hello.
- Do you know where Faith is?
Yes.
Buffy's here with me.
Actually, she's All right.
Xander.
Apparently, there's a report on the television.
..
andbarricaded themselves in the church with 20 parishioners.
One ofthe few who escaped described the three men as disfigured, almostinhuman.
So far one escapee has since died ofsevere neck wounds.
There is no report on the condition ofthe parishioners still inside, but theirassailants have vowed to killall ofthem ifpolice attempt to storm the church.
It's hard to believe.
I've been avoiding this place for so many years and it's nothing.
It's nice.
It's got the pretty windows, the pillars, Iots offolks to eat.
Where's the thing I was so afraid of?
You know, the Lord?
He was supposed to be here.
He gave us this address.
Well, we'll just have to start killing off his people.
See if he shows up.
- What did he say?
- He said I should defer command to you.
Wait till the reserves arrive.
This is a military situation.
- What, they got bombs in there?
- Your men aren't prepared to deal with them.
Buffy.
- How many are in there?
- We think there's three.
- I can do three.
- Not alone.
Wait for the troops to get here.
They're mobilising.
- How did you respond so fast?
- I didn't.
I was just late for church.
When the troops get here send them in, but I'm going.
- I don't want you risking - Don't tell me what to do.
I'm Buffy.
I have to do this.
Then I'm coming with.
I can't use you.
Someone comes out, you get 'em to safety, unless they've got fangs.
I told the cops, they send anyone in, I start the whole massacre thing.
Well, I'm not the cops.
I just come to pray.
Now's a good time to start.
You're not gonna kill these people.
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong.
You're the Slayer.
The one and only.
- You people, get outta here.
- We've gotta get inside.
- The police are handling this.
Back off now.
- But we can't.
You don't understand.
- You have to clear the area.
- Damn it, man!
We have to get inside!
Our Our families are in there.
Our mothers, and tiny, tiny babies.
You think we're afraid ofyou?
We're not afraid of anything any more.
Then let all these people go, and all three ofyou can take me on.
I got a better idea.
- Forgot your coat.
- Riley.
It's OK, miss.
Get yourself out of harm's way.
Riley, it's me.
- Never mind.
How many are in there?
- Well Who are you?
I have strength you couldn't dream of.
Adam has shown me the way and there is nothing - You can't win this.
- Shut up.
D'you think I'm afraid ofyou?
You're nothing.
Disgusting, murderous bitch.
You're nothing.
You're disgusting.
She's gone.
Not a trace.
Giles said the council guys have cleared out, too.
I don't understand.
How could she have?
I mean, how's it possible?
Magic.
I knew there was something.
I should've picked up on it.
I should've just You slept with her.
I slept with you.
Man, would I like to get my hands on her.
Not in a sex way.
- I don't think she's coming back.
- I guess she's had her fun.
Yeah.
Fun.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Get away from me.
- Wanna point that somewhere else?
You all think I'm an idiot.
A short idiot.
Faith switched.
I mean, she had some device.
She switched our bodies.
- Hi, baby.
You miss me?
- I did, actually.
I love you.
You slept with her.
I was created to kill.
To extinguish life wherever I find it.
Tell us what to do.
Xander!
Anya!
Buffy, another one!
Buffy!
- Where's the other one?
- Scampered like a bunny.
In there.
I don't care if it is an orgy of death.
There's still such a thing as a napkin.
A nest.
No biggie.
I bet I could do it.
I know I could take at least two.
Yes, and we could run for help while the others suck your heart out through your neck.
You're right.
It's too many forjust us.
You know who we need?
Hi.
We have a problem.
Sounds like you could use my help.
A quick draw's about more than speed.
It's also about pointing a stake the right way.
And there can be splinter issues.
It is a true test of dexterity.
- Can you open this?
- No, I tear it and it gets all sloshy.
Thanks for doing this, Jonathan.
I wouldn't ask, but Hey, don't worry about it.
Nest full of vampires, you come get me.
OK.
Box full of puppies?
That's more of ajudgment call.
Hit me!
You got me.
It was very punchy.
Watch out for southpaws, Buff.
Don't let 'em surprise you.
Can't find a reference to any rituals.
Seems more like a family meal, ifyou will.
And they say no one needs to have the TV on any more.
Thanks, Rupert.
It's good to know we're not walkin' into some unholy feast or other.
Oh, Jonathan.
I'm in.
Schematics for the crypt.
Part ofthe original plan for the cemetery.
Sometimes there's a Oh, no back way in.
Just the one entrance.
Well, maybe we could make it work for us.
We could stake out the entrance.
- Maybe use a decoy.
Lure 'em out.
- Or I bet - There!
I can get in that way.
- Oh, of course!
Why didn't I think ofthat?
I'm sure you would have.
I think we have a plan.
Buffy, you go in first.
Let 'em get a look at a slayer.
Xander and The Nimzowitsch Defence.
Let's see if I remember.
Mate in four.
You almost got me that time, Rupert.
Xander, Willow and Anya, you back up Buffy.
I'll be the surprise guest.
Everyone, let's show these fiends that they came to the wrong town.
Buffy, he's getting away!
- I should've gotten that one.
- You got two ofthem.
And that second one was ready for ya.
- You should feel good.
- But I let one get by.
Don't worry.
You know it only matters that you do your best.
But that's just it.
I don't think it was my best.
Hey, Jonathan, over here!
A quick photo, please!
- A couple more, a couple more.
- OK, guys, that's enough.
I think we did great.
We knocked 'em dead.
Which they already were.
We knocked 'em deader.
Ifthey'd all rushed at Buffy, they could've killed her right away.
Thanks.
That won't keep me awake.
Vampires only form nests to make hunting easier.
They're not big on the cooperation.
They mostly like to hang out all creepy and alone in the shadows.
Don't you agree, Spike?
Well, well!
The man himself.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
I wasn't pining for a visit from Wonder Jonathan and his Fluffy Battle Kittens.
Yeah?
You think that one up with all the time you're not able to bite people?
Careful.
He's still pretty dangerous.
- Yeah, back off, Betty.
- It's Buffy, you big bleached stupid guy.
Spike, you're the worst type of scum.
The second you're back to your old tricks, Iet's say, before you even sniff out a victim, you'll be pretty indistinguishable from Oh, what should we say?
lnstant soup mix.
Next thing I know, this crazed vamp is, like, running right at me, and I know that if he gets past me there's no telling who's in danger next.
Come on, you have fun.
Admit it.
Living the Scooby life.
I was goin' for a kind of stoic bravery, but yeah.
And it was exciting, with the ceiling coming in and everything.
Oh, that's a cute one.
- And Buffy, she was OK?
- Oh, she was great!
Twang!
Poof!
That was the sound: crossbow, vampire dusting She was a little cranky that she missed that one vamp.
I kind of meant personally.
That whole thing with Faith.
That freaked me out and I was just sensing it from a distance.
Oh, yeah.
I know she's not over the whole Riley-sleeping-with-Faith thing.
You know, Faith's insides and Buffy's outsides, when her insides were out.
I hope they'll be OK.
I'm sure it'll blow over.
They're probably all with the smoochies right now.
- You must be feeling better.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a lot stronger.
I mean, I'm no Jonathan, but I'm doing OK.
Are you?
I mean, you're not?
What?
Eating the lnitiative's technicolour food of strongness?
No.
They swear they've stopped treating the food, but I'm not takin' the chance.
You know, l, uh, I don't know ifthat means I'll get weaker or dumber or smarter.
They're not big with the disclosure, huh?
They still haven't released a profile on Adam.
And we're having zero luck trackin' him.
Ifthey'd just put a little trust in me, I know I could get the job done.
I've felt that way my entire life.
You'd think I could do that.
Guess it takes different muscles than demon beheading.
You just need a few pointers.
Now, if slaying was a competitive sport, I'd have a chance.
You know, we could have figure staking and speed staking.
I Sorry.
This just isn't my game.
I gotta It's all Faith's fault.
She's like poison.
No, worse, she's like acid that eats through everything.
Maybe she's a bomb.
The point is, everything was going along great with Riley, and then she comes along and messes everything up.
Buffy, you know what I think?
I don't think this is about you being angry with Faith.
I think you're angry with Riley.
- Riley?
- Could you, please?
Sure.
I mean, you have this amazing connection with him, and then at the one moment when it matters the most, he looks into your eyes, and he doesn't even see that it's not you looking back at him.
There's no way he could know.
I mean, you don'tjust look at someone and say: "That's not your body!
Get out ofthat body with your hands up"!
I know you know that.
But you have to believe it.
Buffy, ifthere's any part ofyou that's blaming Riley for what happened, it seems like there's a part ofyou that needs to forgive him.
You're Jonathan Levinson!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
My name is Karen and I think you're you're wonderful!
Oh, my God!
Hi, Karen.
Thank you.
Oh, is that my book?
Well, I could Yeah, please.
I didn't wanna bother you.
It's Karen with a K. Thank you!
So much!
Thanks!
So what do you think, Buffy?
I mean, if I'm wrong, smack me.
Karen with a K will lend you a book, and it's pretty heavy.
Maybe I have been blaming him.
But how do I get past it?
What if it's too late?
What if after all this he doesn't want me any more?
He does.
It's not gonna be easy, Buffy, but you guys are very special together.
That's worth a little hard work.
But I'm not even sure if I know how to talk to him any more.
How do I make it OK again?
Ifyou really want it, you can make anything happen.
For those ofyou who don't already know, my name is Colonel George Haviland.
I'm commanding officer here until such time as the facility review is completed.
This review does not mean our primary mission is changed in any way.
Recovery ofthe hostile known as Adam is our first and most importantjob.
To this end, I've asked our tactical consultant here to address us today.
Mr Levinson.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- It's about time we brought out the big guns.
Men, before we can locate Adam, we need to understand him better.
And there's somethin' that's bothered me almost from the start.
He doesn't eat.
We've known him to kill, but never to eat the kill.
So I pulled some of Professor Walsh's original design schematics, and I found something.
His power source is not biological at all.
It's here.
The design attempts to hide it, but I believe that there's a small reservoir of uranium 235.
Sir, how long will it last?
Essentially forever.
It also means that cutting off his head is useless.
Killing Adam means annihilating him completely.
But first we have to find him.
Where are you, Jonathan?
Are you, like, never home?
- I feel terrible.
- She's ready to forget it.
- You'd better be ready too.
- I don't know, Jonathan.
I mean, I don't know if she'll really ever forget it.
- Every time I try to touch her - She's scared.
- Scared of me?
- Scared ofwhat you're thinking about.
- What do you mean?
- She knows that Faith is experienced.
What are you saying?
Experienced?
God!
Does she think that that I'd be comparing?
She knows she's the one l I care about.
- Have you let her know that?
- I think l Haven't l?
She has to know.
People can't always see what's right in front ofthem.
I loves the big witch doctor, who stirred a brew for me I took sips from your sweet lips and now I can't get free Trapped in a web of love Trapped in a web of love - Did not.
- Last night.
With me.
- You said "Jonathan".
- It was a moan!
Fine!
You moaned"Jonathan".
It was like, "Ahh-n".
Maybe it was "Ahh-nathan".
Still not fluffin' up the old ego.
Quite the couple, aren't they?
They get into a fist fight, I got a 50 on Anya.
I wonder ifthey'll make it.
Good evening, everyone.
I'd like to dedicate this song to some friends of mine.
A very special couple who've been going through a tough time.
When I hear that serenade in blue I'm somewhere in another world Alone with you Sharing all the joys we used to know Many moons ago Once again your face comes back to me Just like the theme of some forgotten Melody ln the album of my memory Serenade ln blue It seems like only yesterday A small café, a crowded floor And as we danced the night away I hear you say forevermore And then the song became a sigh Forevermore became goodbye But you remain in my heart Tell me, darling, is there still a spark?
- Buffy, I want you to know.
- Do we have to have the talk?
No talk.
More dance.
I just wanna say I'm sorry.
That it's only you that I want.
I know.
- I know all ofthat.
- You do?
Since when?
Since you put your arms around me.
Oh, my God!
He's gonna do something offthe new album.
Xander.
Let's go and have sex now.
Yeah.
OK.
What is it?
Are you OK?
Karen!
That's your name, isn't it?
I signed my book for you.
Tell me what hurt you, Karen.
I can help.
Let's get you warmed up.
What's going on?
Why are you here?
Mr Levinson, someone on your staff reported a disturbance.
When I realised it was on your property I thought I'd come in person.
- That's all right.
I have it under control.
- Of course, sir.
Glad to see you're all right.
Karen, I know you're scared, but I need to hear your description again.
It was ugly.
Big ugly.
All bent over, sort of, with these huge arms and, like, scabs and stuff.
That must have been very frightening.
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I forgot.
It had a mark.
- A mark?
On its forehead, like a symbol.
Oh.
This is a clue.
- Jonathan?
- I've heard ofthis.
It's not a demon, just a monster.
Not much more than an animal.
It sticks to the woods.
It doesn't come near populated areas.
But it did this time.
It might again.
Maybe we should patrol?
- Ifyou want me to mobilise the squad - I think Karen simply startled it.
Probably more afraid ofyou than you were of it.
I'll patrol.
Don't worry.
I can handle it on my own.
Now, let's see about getting Karen a ride home.
I wish you'd get rid ofthat body.
The smell's makin' me hungry.
You wouldn't want it.
It had a blood disease.
It didn't know it but it would've been dead within the year.
Humans sense so little ofwhat they carry inside.
All right.
Well, you're the Evil Messiah Guy, so Oh, hey, there's something new in town.
Yeah, attacked a girl, caused a little fuss.
Oh.
He was there.
- Jonathan.
- Jonathan?
Tell me, who is he?
You're jokin', right?
Jonathan is Jonathan.
Look!
These are lies.
None ofthis is real.
The world has been changed.
It's intriguing, but it's wrong.
- Feels OK to me.
- You're under his spell, just like the others.
- I seem to be the only one who's not.
- Really?
And what makes you so special?
I'm aware.
I know every molecule of myself and everything around me.
No one - no human, no demon - has ever been as awake and alive as I am.
You are all just shadows.
So, what do you do now?
Hey, you could kill Jonathan!
Well, or you could try.
The guy's like a dynamo of action.
I don't need to do anything.
These magics are unstable, corrosive.
They will inevitably lead to chaos.
And I am interested in chaos.
Jonathan, aren't you coming to bed?
Ja, it's getting late.
Be right there.
I'm glad you're OK.
Everyone in the Bronze was pretty freaked out after you left.
So, I guess you have to go fight this thing, huh?
All the weapons are at Giles's.
It shouldn't take too long.
- No go.
- Did you just go "no go"?
Jonathan did.
He said it was some brainless beastie and that he'd take care of it.
Oh, cool.
I guess.
I don't know, he just He seemed a little scared.
Buffy, this is Jonathan.
You know he doesn't get scared.
You talked about it when you gave him the Class Protector Award at the prom.
You're right.
My exit.
Willow, I'll see you tomorrow?
OK.
So, saw you and Riley, with the dancing?
That was a great dance.
For the first time, it felt like Faith wasn't there.
Like no one was there but us.
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
She's gonna be OK.
But she's terrified.
What happened?
Who did this?
Someone found her in the janitor's closet about an hour ago.
I think she was there all night.
She was all alone.
Tara, what did this?
Big Iumpy Had something on its head, like Iike a Greek letter, only not.
This?
Was it this?
Buffy, Jonathan said we were all safe.
Jonathan said it.
Xander's not here.
You're not going away.
Why aren't you going away?
Well, I was kind of hoping to look at some of Xander's stuff.
Sure.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
And so on.
Oh, you're still here?
That's nice.
May I ask you something?
Does it ever seem just a little strange that Jonathan is so good at everything?
He's Jonathan.
Hey!
I was just at the part where he invents the lnternet.
Anya, he fights better than I do.
And I'm the Slayer.
The Slayer!
I mean, that's supposed to mean something, right?
Buck up, you.
You kill the best.
Go, you.
Kill, kill.
Actually not needing validation right now, but thank you.
He just seems too perfect.
- I don't know.
- So I can have my book back?
Anya, when you were a demon, you granted wishes, right?
Vengeance wishes on ex-boyfriends.
I'd wish he was a dog, or ugly, or in love with President McKinley or something.
But someone could wish the whole world to be different, right?
That's possible?
Sure.
Alternate realities.
You could have, like, a world without shrimp.
Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp.
You could even make a freaky world where Jonathan's a mouth-breather, ifthat's what's blowing up your skirt.
Just don't ask me to live there.
Now, if, uh I can just have my book back, you'll be on your way someplace else?
Here.
I'm just saying it doesn't make any sense.
He starred in The Matrix, but he never left town.
And how did he graduate from med school?
He's only 18.
Effective time management?
I'm sorry, Buffy, but l I just don't understand what you're trying to say.
Yeah, and when is Jonathan gonna get here and start the meeting?
- This is the meeting.
- This is the meeting?
Well, I was just kind of wondering if maybe anyone else thought that Jonathan was kind oftoo perfect?
No, he's not!
He's just perfect enough!
He crushed the Master, blew up a big steak made out of Mayor, and coached the US women's soccer team to World Cup victory.
- We saw him doin' those things.
- But that's just it.
I'm not entirely sure that we can trust our memories.
- Tell them about the alternate universes.
- Oh, OK.
Say you really like shrimp a lot.
Or we could say you don't like shrimp at all.
- "Blah, I wish there weren't any shrimp".
- Stop, you're saying it wrong!
I think that Jonathan may be doing something so that he's manipulating the world and we're all, like, his pawns.
Or prawns.
Stop with the shrimp.
I am trying to do something here!
Of course, but I think you may be a little out ofyour depth.
- I'm not.
- It sounds like nonsense.
But I'm starting to know this girl pretty well.
And I think she sees things that the rest of us don't.
I think, for once, we should follow her lead.
OK.
I think Jonathan might be ignoring evidence.
I think he might have let Tara get hurt.
- On purpose?
- No!
No.
How did he ignore evidence?
The monster had a mark on it.
Jonathan saw it and he kind of - blinked.
- He blinked?
The man moistens his eyeballs and we're having a meeting about it.
He knows something about the monster.
He was reacting to the mark.
Oh!
Wait.
I remember something.
Giles, do you have a Jonathan swimsuit calendar?
No.
Yes.
It was a gift.
No.
No.
No.
There.
Oh.
Yeah.
Pretty darn lickable.
The other kind of "oh".
That's it.
That's what Tara saw.
Why would Jonathan have the same mark as the monster?
I don't know.
But he's definitely keeping Is this a private conversation?
Or can Mr July sit in?
- Jonathan.
- Hi!
Buffy was just saying how you had a monster cut up Willow's friend and Buffy?
No.
It's just the mark.
You said it was safe, and it wasn't.
I'm sorry, I just don't understand.
Then I'll explain.
Buffy is right.
No.
I do have a history with the creature.
The monster.
The problem is, every time I face it my mind becomes sort of confused.
- There's some kind of power it possesses.
- Oh!
He's like your kryptonite.
Maybe.
I just know that it takes all my energy to try and fight the confusion.
That's why I had his mark tattooed on me: so that I wouldn't underestimate it next time.
- This does explain everything.
- I knew he wouldn't do anything on purpose.
Me too.
And that whole alternate universe thing was too freaky.
Jonathan, let's go after the monster.
Right now, you and me.
I'm sure it's left town by now.
That's been its pattern.
We can try.
Sure.
Let's do that.
- Goodbye, Jonathan!
- Goodbye.
Oh, look.
Jonathan.
Taking the little sidekick out for a walk, are we?
- Shut up, Spike.
- Ooh!
Semi-harsh language from Betty.
You're feisty when the big guy's standing beside you.
Someday, sweet Slayer, I would love to take you on.
See you face the evil alone, for once.
That's enough ofthe creepy small talk.
We're looking for a monster.
- Why would I know about that?
- Every demon's gunning for you, so I figure you're keeping good track of 'em.
Big arms, mark on its head.
- Have you seen it?
- No.
But then again, I'm probably lying.
We're not getting anything outta him.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to do that!
You're pretty much relying on butcher's blood these days, right?
- What are you saying?
- Just that the butchers respect Jonathan.
They do him a favour and you might find yourself getting kinda thirsty.
Look, I don't know much, OK?
Some vampires got kicked out of a cave in the hills behind Brookside Park.
I don't know what did the kicking out, but it was probably pretty big.
That was very good.
Very good.
These spells.
These really work?
I mean, can you really turn your enemies inside out?
Or - Iearn to excrete gold coins?
- That one's not so much fun.
They work, Riley, but they take concentration.
Being attuned with the forces ofthe universe.
Right.
You can'tjust go "Iibrum incendere" and expect Xander, don't speak Latin in front ofthe books.
Hey, I found the mark.
It's part of an augmentation spell.
Jonathan did an augmentation spell.
What, uh did he have?
You know.
Him.
And how we see him.
This spell turns the sorcerer into a paragon.
The best of everything.
Everyone's ideal.
But there's a drawback.
- A drawback?
- That happens a lot.
In order to balance the new force of good, the spell must create the opposing force of evil.
- The worst of everything.
A nightmare.
- He created the monster.
So we're saying he did a spell just to make us think he was cool?
Yes.
That is so cool.
Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this nightmare thing.
Are they gonna be OK?
It seems the wellbeing ofthis creature is linked to Jonathan.
If it dies the spell is broken and Jonathan reverts to whatever he was before.
Jonathan isn't gonna want Buffy to get very far.
Fall down there and be dead for a while.
Yeah.
Don't want that to happen.
Come on.
We've got a monster Buffy was right.
- Buffy was right.
- It doesn't sound very likely, does it?
So, ifthis is the world he created, what's the real world like?
I'm scared.
Everything's gonna change.
Actually, it'll remain pretty much the same, except Jonathan won't be Jonathan.
- Well, not our Jonathan, anyway.
- No!
No!
No!
World without sunshine.
World withoutjoy!
But it only changes back if Buffy kills this thing.
I mean, if she loses, then we could be stuck in this wrong world for ever.
Things looking up.
I mean, we're all happy here, right?
You know, if she doesn't get killed?
Giles, can Buffy do it?
I honestly don't know.
She's never stood alone against something like this before.
- What do I do?
- You'll have to handle this one solo.
- What?
But How?
- You'll know.
You used to.
And the more you hurt it the more I'll lose my What?
Lose your I remember this.
Is good.
- I can't believe we believed it.
- It seemed so real.
Well, in that world, it was real.
Alternate realities are neat.
- You know what I'll always remember?
- The swimsuit calendar sticks in my mind.
Not in a good way.
I'll always remember the way he made me feel about me.
Valued, respected.
Sort oftingly.
Now I'm just empty.
Poor Xander.
I guess Jonathan hurt you most of all.
Except, of course, after Tara.
Did anyone else feel way too tall?
I felt way too tall.
I liked his clothes.
He had really cool clothes.
- I don't understand how he got the house.
- And who really did star in The Matrix?
Wait.
That wasn't real either?
Hi.
I wasn't sure you'd come over.
Everyone's mostly forgetting, but I think some people are kinda angry.
Yeah.
Nobody's even talking to me.
And the twins moved out.
Why did you do it, anyway?
No.
I get why.
How?
After the thing with the bell tower and the gun, I went to counselling.
You know, other kids with problems, and one ofthem had this spell.
He glossed right over the monster.
Well, anyway, I just I just wanted to apologise.
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
Jonathan, you get why everyone is angry, though, right?
It's notjust the monster.
People didn't like being the little actors in your sock-puppet theatre.
You weren't!
You weren't socks!
You were friends.
You can't keep trying to make everything work out with some big gesture all at once.
Things are complicated.
They take time and work.
Yeah.
Right.
Hey, Buffy.
You remember I gave you some advice?
- Watch out for southpaws?
- No.
About you and Riley.
I mean, things are kinda starting to blur, but this cool thing I said that I don't really remember.
I think it's right.
I think it's kind ofthe same thing you just said to me.
About things taking work.
Yeah.
I remember.
Good.
Because it's true.
What you have is really complicated, but it's worth it.
I think that's what I said.
I'm glad we talked this all out.
We haven't talked at all.
Well, whatever we're doing, we're doing it great.
Jonathan Marisa Castle de Joncaire
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Remove your clothing now.
Relationship.
What kind do we have, and what is it progressing toward?
They don't even know I exist.
I just like having something that's just, you know, mine.
I am, you know.
What?
Yours.
OK, you get Fang, I'll get Horny.
I mean Vampire-demon tag team.
Who says we can't all get along?
- I don't recall ever seeing that before.
- Cos it never happens.
Vamps hate demons.
It's like stripes and polka dots.
Major clashing.
- So, I guess we should tell Giles about this.
- Right.
I mean, it's the kind ofthing he'd wanna know about.
- Like as soon as possible.
- As soon as possible.
I mean it now.
First thing in the morning, we go tell Giles.
First thing.
Good plan.
Aw, come on.
Big party at Riley's house.
It's gonna be fun.
- Why don't you wanna go?
- You know why not.
Those lnitiative men make me not comfortable.
And you don't care.
They don't know you're an ex-demon.
And we don't know they'd care even ifthey did know.
Which they're not gonna find out.
Anyway, they'll be too busy flirtin' with girls to notice you.
So, you don't think I'm desirable enough to be flirted with?
- Is that it?
- I'm just not gonna win here, am l?
- You don't find me attractive any more.
- What?
I think you're gorgeous.
Oh, really?
Well, then, why didn't we have sex last night?
Is that what this is about?
We've gone other nights without sex.
I know.
Twice.
- I can't believe we're breaking up!
- Breaking?
We're not.
- Are we?
- Of course we are.
You've obviously grown tired of me.
I've seen it happen to many women over the centuries.
I just never thought it would happen to me.
Anya, there's a lot more to you and me than the sex.
Well, there should be.
A relationship is something that you work at.
Work through.
Together.
I don't understand.
I'm pretty, I'm young.
I mean, why didn't you take advantage of me?
- Is something wrong with your body?
- There's nothing wrong with my body.
Well, there must be.
I saw that wrinkled man on TV talking about erectile dysfunction Whoa!
Hey!
All systems go here.
No function problem, OK?
You want sex?
Let's have sex.
Right here.
Hot, sweaty, big sex.
There's always been discordbetween them.
And yet you say the vampire went to the demon's aid.
The two ofthem were working as a team?
Everything except patting each other on the behind.
Extraordinarily odd.
As a rule, demons have no empathy for any other species other than their own.
Most think of vampires as abominations.
Mixing with human blood and all.
- So what brought these two together?
- Not what.
Who.
- Adam?
- Think about it.
Who better to bring together demon types than someone made out of demon types?
So he's bridging the gap between the races.
Huh.
Like Martin Luther King.
I suggest that over the next few nights you two concentrate your patrol in that same area.
Ifthere's any other peculiar pairings or groupings, you let me know.
I'll tell the squad as well.
They're patrolling.
We'll have a reserve unit out during the party.
- Party?
- Tomorrow.
We're havin' a thing.
- At a time like this?
Whose idea was that?
- Mine.
The boys are pretty ragged.
Need to let off steam.
- Point taken.
- You're welcome to come.
Well, much as l, er, long for a good kegger, I have other plans.
- The Espresso Pump.
- What are you doing there?
I'm It's a meeting of grown-ups.
It couldn't possibly be of any interest to you lot.
Buffy, hey, look at the time.
Don't you have a class?
- Yeah, in about 20 minutes.
- Yeah, but I have that thing.
Right, that thing we could squeeze in before.
Bye.
They're probably going to Yes, thank you, Willow.
I did attend a university in the Mesozoic era.
I do remember what it's like.
- Didn't we fix the furnace?
It's freezing.
- I'll call in the a.m., get somebody to come.
When do these two come up for air?
Slaves to the rhythm.
- It should've warmed up by now.
- I built this an hour ago.
It's still an icebox.
Don't bother, Mason.
We got a couple of heat generators pumpin' away upstairs.
Jesus!
Call an ambulance!
Get help!
Oh.
It's you.
Spike!
What are you doing?
You made me yell really high.
Hey.
Yeah, I did.
I scared you.
- Give me money.
- I'm not paying you for scaring me.
- You're not paying me.
I'm robbing you.
- Oh, that's just ludicrous.
You can't hurt me - you got a chip in your brain.
And I like my money when it's mine.
Oh, now come on.
You're not even bumpy any more.
I was just a minute ago.
Hang on.
Get me mad again.
Does this really work?
Scaring people into giving you their money?
Yeah, it works.
Keeps me in blood and beers.
Plus it's funny, watching the little humans quail.
- Now I understand why you're friendless.
- Look who's talking.
I don't see Droopy Boy on your arm.
Did he have better things to do?
You're kidding?
Mason requested to go on patrol?
He didn't want the girls to see his eyebrows burnt off.
He's lucky that's all he lost.
You should've seen it, Rye.
It was weird as hell.
How many kids?
I don't know.
A whole herd of 'em.
And some parents to boot.
It's kind of embarrassing - welcome to the life with Anya.
- You don't know if she's coming tonight?
- I'm thinking no.
She was pretty upset.
Which makes me wonder, is it me?
Am I the crazy one?
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
Hey, Buffy, this might be a good time to mention that someone, so not me, spilled something purply on your peasant top, which I'd never borrow without asking.
- Still love me?
- Uh-huh.
Huh?
What about my peasant top?
- Nothin'.
- Xander was just talking about Anya.
Oh, it's nothing much.
Just feeling glad that a certain ex-demon doesn't have any powers.
Boy, I miss those powers.
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
A year and a half ago, I could have eviscerated him with my thoughts.
Now I can barely hurt his feelings.
Things used to be so much simpler.
You know, you take the killing for granted.
And then it's gone, and you're like I wish I'd appreciated it more.
Stopped and smelled the corpses, you know?
Yeah.
Now everything's complicated.
It's a terrible thing, love is.
I've been there myself.
- Ended badly.
- Of course it did.
It always does.
I've seen a thousand relationships.
First there's the love and sex.
Then there's nothing left but the vengeance.
It's how it works.
You and I should just go do the vengeance.
Both of us.
You eviscerate Xander and I'll stake Dru.
Like a project.
I don't know.
I just can't.
But you can go do Dru, though.
Yeah.
I will.
Maybe later.
See, the thing they're afraid to teach us about is the inherent sensuality of language.
You learn French and they make it all about conjugations and fronted vowels, but nobody really talks about you know, the way language tastes.
You know, the way it feels rolling over your tongue.
I mean, just think about "car" versus "voiture".
- Wow!
- Are you all right?
I'm fine!
l Oh, my God!
Wow.
Wow.
- You really like French.
- Yeah, well Lowell House.
1962.
Yes.
I'm just, you know, impressing you with my knowledge of local history.
Or my knowledge of reading.
And you didn't even have to sound anything out.
You should see me add short columns of small numbers.
You're funny.
Thanks.
That is, funny "how amusing", or funny "back away and avoid eye contact"?
Kinda both.
- Who are you here with?
- Right now I seem to be here with you.
Hey, can we?
I need you to take a look at an essay for a class.
That essay.
Right.
Here.
I'll catch you guys in a minute.
There's an essay I gotta look at.
And I'm the one who got a D in covert ops.
- Hey, Evan, come here.
You gotta see this.
- I'm gettin' a beer.
No, no, no.
First, just put your hand right here.
OK.
Somehow this is a trick, I know it.
Now stay.
Don't move.
Whoa!
What is that?
I kinda feel God!
Oh, God!
Horses.
Like, big, tall, teeth-that-could-take-your-arm-off horses?
Well, sure.
I learned to ride when I was a kid.
It's fun.
And, by the way, most horses don't like arm very much.
I had a bad birthday-party-pony thing when I was four.
I look at horses and I see really big ponies.
You should ride with me sometime.
I guarantee safety and fun.
Well, ifyou promise you'll look after me.
Don't touch me!
That's disgusting!
Tara?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to - Are you feeling OK?
- I'm fine.
I just wanna go to the bathroom.
Hey.
I know these guys from somewhere.
Initiative soldiers.
They live here.
Experiments happen under the house.
It's where they put in your chip.
Let's have fun!
You brought me here?
Anya?
What are you doing?
You brought him here?
That's what I said.
Only I hit the "here" part.
Anya, we had a little fight.
Itjust means we have to work our way through some stuff.
It doesn't mean we rebound with the evil undead.
And what have you been doing with him, anyway?
Who's the puffed-up manly man, all splotchy and possessive?
It's not very convincing, is it?
I see now what you said about him earlier.
No follow-through.
Hey!
What a surprise.
Hostile 17!
Can I get you a drink, Hostile 17?
Xander, stop.
Well, may be some fun to be had in the lion's den after all.
You two keep scraping.
I'll find the liquor.
Anya, what are you doin' with him?
We didn't have sex, ifthat's what you mean.
That's all I do now - not have sex.
You're overreacting.
We had a fight.
But see, it's OK.
It's normal.
Yes.
It's the normal part of ending a relationship, before the vengeance begins.
Right.
No!
- Vengeance?
- Relax, I'm not going to do it.
It's just that we have nothing in common besides both of us liking your penis.
And now I don't even have that!
So I get to say when it's done.
And it's done.
You know what?
You don't deserve to be the one to walk away from this.
I've put up with a hell of a lot from you, much ofthat in the last minute, and if anyone gets to be the one to leave, it's me.
- You're leaving me?
- Yes.
I am.
- Where are you going?
- To enjoy the party.
Well, then, I'm staying too, to show you how much I'm not bothered by you having fun.
- Because I'll be having more fun.
- I'm having fun already.
Me too.
Whoo-hoo!
Sometimes I just don't get the sophisticated college lifestyle.
Gee, it's a good thing Mom's out.
We'd be in trouble.
Hey, buddy.
You look familiar.
Yeah.
I get that a lot.
Hey, Xander.
Julie.
OK.
This, then, would be the kissing.
Very smooth cheek you have there.
Do you exfoliate?
Whoa!
Julie!
What?
I'm sorry.
I didn't I'm sorry.
Oh my God!
Touch it!
- I'm bad.
I'm bad.
- Hi.
You OK?
Julie?
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
Tara?
It's me.
Tara?
Tara?
Was that Willow?
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.
Hey, guys, that girl Julie, she's freakin' out.
Is anyone friends with Julie?
Xander?
Tara?
Xander.
Ghost Boy.
Drowning in a tub.
I tried to save him, but, being a ghost already, well, I was way too late.
A ghost?
What's the deal?
ls every frat on this campus haunted?
And if so, why do people keep coming to these parties?
Cos it's not the snacks.
Tara, how are you?
I'm OK, but I don't like it here.
This house.
I think we should go.
We need Buffy.
Buffy?
Buffy?
Riley?
Buffy!
Buffy!
Buffy!
- Do you wanna go back?
- Never.
Buffy!
Riley!
Buffy!
We gotta get 'em outta there.
Well, this party's starting to liven up after all.
Graham!
Help get these people to safety!
Touch not the impure thing.
For ye shall perish.
Find salvation in the cross of our Lord and Saviour.
Right.
Retinalscan accepted.
Anya.
Come on.
Please, God, help me!
We got trouble upstairs.
Some sort of disembodied presence in the house.
We've been paging you.
This thing must be scrambling the frequencies.
Guard section 2, level 5 precautions.
Ifthe locking mechanisms malfunction, - you know what to do.
- Got it.
- You with me?
- I'm good.
Let's lock it down.
- We have to go back in there.
- Why?
Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.
So?
She's the Slayer, he's a soldier boy.
What do they need you for?
Anya, look around.
There's ghosts and shaking, and people are going all Felicity with their hair.
We're fresh out of superpeople and somebody's gotta go back in there.
Now who's with me?
I am.
I know I'm not the first choice for heroics.
And Buffy's tried to kill me more than once.
And I don't fancy a single one ofyou at all.
But Actually, all that sounds pretty convincing.
I wonder ifAsian House is open.
- Xander, let's get outta here.
- You wanna bail, fine.
I'm goin' in there and I'm not comin' out until I bring my friend with me.
Or it could be Watcher time.
We'll go to Giles.
He isn't there.
He was going to the Espresso Pump.
Right.
He told us not to come.
He needed some grown-up time.
No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like To be hated Wow Could we go back to the haunted house?
Because this is creeping me out.
Does he do this a lot?
Sure.
Every day the earth rotates backward and the skies turn orange.
As my conscience seems to be I have hours Only lonely Now I remember why I used to have such a crush on him.
Well, he is pretty good.
His voice is pleasant.
What?
Oh, come on.
It is kinda sexy.
I'm fighting total mental breakdown here, Will.
No more fuel in the fire, please.
And I blame you You're you're too far away from me.
I'm right here.
You have to keep touching me.
When you called to Buffy and Riley, they didn't cry out or respond in any way?
No.
They're probably dead.
Unless they're too busy doin' it to answer.
Doing what?
You know, for a god of acoustic rock, you're kind of naive.
I didn't think you meant In the midst of all that, do you really think they were keeping it up?
- Oh, for a different phrasing.
- That's the thing.
People all over the party were starting to act weird.
Sexually.
In what way?
You know.
Ways.
Well, it could be some form of succubi, or a satyr's prank.
It could even be energy coming from the lab beneath Lowell fraternity.
It wasn't always a fraternity.
Look.
Between 1949 and 1960, the Lowell Home for Children housed upwards of40 adolescents.
Runaways, delinquents, and emotionally disturbed teenagers from the Sunnydale area.
Children?
Did any ofthem die in there?
Ifthere were deaths, then perhaps we're dealing with a fairly standard haunting.
It doesn't say.
It's mostly about the old house director, Genevieve Holt.
Sunnydale children's aide.
giving disadvantaged kids the love and care they deserve.
When did she die?
She didn't.
No, no, I don't mind at all.
I was up.
Early morning prayer, of course.
And I like talking about my kids.
I still call them that.
My kids.
I suppose you were just like a mother to them.
You did everything for them.
Oh, yes.
I fed them and clothed them.
Educated them in the way ofthe Lord.
- I was given a medal.
- Yes.
Wonderful.
Congratulations.
This'll sound a little strange, but did you notice any odd disturbances in the house?
I don't understand.
Well, like furniture moving of its own accord, or objects appearing out of nowhere.
Or perhaps you saw someone appear one moment and then they were gone the next, inexplicably.
Why, that sounds like crazy talk.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Forgive me for asking this, but the children in your care, were any ofthem ever ill, or did anything ever happen to any ofthem?
Well, some had the flu and such.
No one died, ifthat's what you mean.
The medal says how good I was with the children.
Oh, yes.
I treated them as I would my own flesh and blood.
Gave them hugs and praise when they were good, and punished them when they were dirty.
Children will be children.
They do like to play in the muck.
- You didn't mean muddy dirty.
- My kids didn't think I knew, but I did.
Very perceptive ofyou.
Without me they would have been shut out ofthe Kingdom.
Lost to lust.
But you helped them.
The girls fell to vanity more than the boys.
I'd see them preening like Jezebel, doting over their pretty hair.
So you'd hack it off?
I'd remove the temptation to admire themselves.
- They were better for it.
- What about the bathtub?
I performed baptisms on the most unclean.
Those who were tainted with impure thought and deed.
You held them under.
They needed to be reborn.
- You choose to pass judgment on me?
- Well, someone ought to!
You traumatised and abused these children.
Children who would no doubt become extremely disturbed adults.
You have ruined lives, Mrs Holt.
What you did has now manifested itself as a malevolent presence which threatens more lives!
You have a great deal to answer for.
I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on each and every one ofyou.
Yeah?
You smell sin?
Let me tell you somethin', lady.
She who smelt it dealt it!
It's like what you said, but faster.
This totally adds to my "old people are crazy" theorem.
Those kids were tortured but not killed, so where are those ghosts coming from?
I don't believe there are any ghosts.
- One ran right through me.
- Not a ghost.
An apparition.
We're dealing with a kind of poltergeist.
A whole cluster ofthem.
Born out of intense adolescent emotion and sexual energy.
Both ofwhich were totally pent up during Mrs Holt's reign of repression.
So, with Buffy and Riley having acts of nakedness around the clock lately, maybe they set something free.
Like a big burstin' poltergasm.
Yes.
And now the poltergeists are drawing more and more energy out ofthem.
Feeding on them, in fact.
Buffy and Riley are powering this whole thing.
OK, they're the battery in the boo factory.
So what happens when the battery's drained?
They die.
Don't stop.
Never stop touching me.
What good are weapons against disembodied spirits?
- They have no ass to kick.
- She's right.
You should just stay outside.
We'll bind the spirits so you can get Riley and Buffy out.
- How much time are you buyin'?
- Could be tricky.
We're calling upon the communal spirit of a certain time and place.
Let's go.
- What do you feel?
- Sad.
Afraid of being without you.
And a little hungry.
- I meant about the house.
- Oh.
Still haunted.
Give me your hands.
Form a circle.
Children ofthe past, spirits of Lowell, be guided by our light.
Come forth and be known to us.
How will we know when it works?
We'll know.
House is clean.
Let's go.
You first.
Need to work fast.
Never know how long before the munchkins get homesick.
Or the human battery conks out.
Watch your fingers.
We implore you, be still.
Find it in your hearts to leave our friends passage.
Transform your pain.
Release your past.
And get over it.
You OK?
Find here the serenity you seek!
The peace you - What's happened?
- We lost them.
Xander.
Xander!
Xander!
Shut up, repressed cry-babies!
Come on.
We just gotta Xander!
We can make it through this.
Xander, get it off!
Push.
Xander!
Don't you knock?
I can'tbelieve ithappened.
I just had no idea.
It's so creepy.
He was really singing?
I'd say it was more like crooning.
Ifwe grow old together, remind me to skip the midlife crisis.
OK.
You have to admit, it was kinda sexy.
Please stop saying that.
I'm willing to offer cash incentives.
We're just lucky no one got injured.
- No thanks to us.
- Don't be too hard on yourself.
He's right, Will.
If Riley and I hadn't gotten so wrapped up in each other, - none ofthis would've happened.
- True.
Feel shame.
My girlfriend.
Mistress ofthe learning plateau.
Really, it wasn't your fault.
You were under the influence of powerful magics.
We were like zombies.
I had no control over myself at all.
Must've been horrible.
- Yeah.
Horrible.
- It was bad.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- I'm a werewolfin love.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Oz, don't you love me?
The wolfis inside me all the time.
Untillfigure out what thatmeans, lshouldn'tbe aroundyou, oranybody.
The lnitiative made it.
They can't stop it, but we will.
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can'tharm anyliving creature.
I get this chip out, we're gonna have a confrontation.
I just like having something that's mine.
I am, you know - yours.
- Do you like cats?
- I'm more of a dog person myself.
But I'm not, like, "Death to all cats".
Why?
- Cos I was thinking of getting one.
- Can you have one in dorms?
No, but this would be a sneaky cat.
That would be cool.
You mean it'd be, sort of like a familiar?
Actually, I was thinking it'd be sort of like a pet.
You know, we could name her Trixie or Miss Kitty Fantastico or something.
And we could make Kitty go bonkers with string and catnip?
- Absolutely.
- Fun.
I'm in.
- So you're not allergic or anything?
- Nope.
Good, cos I want my room to be Willow-friendly.
Me, too.
So, I'm excited about the Scooby meeting.
I think.
- What's it about?
- I'm not sure.
Probablyjust your garden-variety disaster.
Zippo.
Patrol's been totally uneventful.
My kill count's way down.
She means there's been less bad-guy activity.
- We know what that often indicates.
- Buffy doesn't make her quota?
Bad slayer.
I wish it were that innocuous, but with Adam around I feel he's involved somehow.
When things get slow it's usually because there's extra evil brewing.
But the weird thing is, we've been busy at the lnitiative.
Our squads have got demons coming out our ears.
- That's a metaphor.
- I got it, thanks.
I'm overhelping, aren't l?
So the activity's shifted, not stopped.
- It's fascinating.
- To an extremely bored person maybe.
Well, that was a thrilling hour.
I don't appreciate your snide remarks, Anya.
I have a lot of experience.
If I say a matter of import is brewing, l Hey.
Oz.
When when did you get back?
Pretty much now.
Oz.
Man Hate to sound grandma, but you don't call, you don't write.
Yeah.
Sorry.
So are you here here, orjust passing through?
Let's not bombard the poor chap with questions right off.
Can I get you something?
Tea perhaps?
I'll pass.
Thanks.
Look, I'm going to Devon's to see if he's got a place I can crash, but I was hoping that we could talk.
Later.
Tonight?
I guess so.
I'll come by your place?
OK.
It's great to see you guys again.
Really.
Everyone's uncomfortable now.
- You OK?
- I I just I realised I'm late for study group.
- Tara, wait.
- No, no, it's OK.
You should be with your friends, and and I should go.
But So, I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't l?
Break-ups are tough, but when Oz walked in it seemed emotions were running extra high.
Oz and Willow had a rough break-up.
Hold that thought.
Man.
That was record time.
- It's no fun when they're that easy.
- Speak for yourself.
Base, this is Agent Finn.
We've an HST down.
Please send a retrieval team to sector 72.
We're swampedhere.
We'llget to itas soon as we can.
So, I was about to say something fascinating.
- Oz and Willow.
- Right.
They had a rough break-up.
Some stuff came up and Oz pretty much bailed overnight.
It left Will really devastated.
I remember.
Before that they were doing great.
She was dealing with Oz being a werewolf Whoa.
Back up there.
Oz is a werewolf and Willow was dating him?
- Yes.
Hence the high emotions.
- You're kidding me.
Gotta say, I'm surprised.
I didn't think Willow was that kind of girl.
- What kind of girl?
- Into dangerous guys.
- She seems smarter than that.
- Oz is not dangerous.
Something happened to him that wasn't his fault.
God, I never knew you were such a bigot.
Whoa.
Hey.
How did we get to bigot?
It's just weird to date someone who tries to eat you.
Yeah, well, love isn't logical, Riley.
It's not like you can be Mr Joe Sensible about it all the time.
God knows, I haven't been.
I'm not talking about you.
How about we don't talk about this at all?
OK?
Let's just patrol.
Hey.
Hey.
So, you wanna come inside?
Actually, I want you to come outside.
I wanna show you something.
Oz.
This is all so weird.
I feel like this isn't really happening.
Like it's a dream or something.
It's real.
Look up.
- What?
- Look at the sky.
I guess you stopped keeping track after I left.
Full moon.
Full moon.
Full moon, but how?
I mean, you did it.
How did you do it?
Where did you go?
It's a long story.
My God, Oz.
This is I mean, that's wonderful for you.
I talked to Xander, and he said you didn't have a new guy.
No.
No new guy.
I know what I put you through, and I'm not gonna push.
But I am a different person than when I left.
And I can be what you need now.
That's what I want.
That's why I'm here.
This is sector27.
We're all clear.
Sir.
I love this.
A woman in Tibet traded it to me for the Radiohead record.
Got a lot of mileage out ofthe barter system.
So, Tibet was your favourite?
Well, it's where I stayed the longest.
A warlock in Romania sent me to the monks there to learn some meditation techniques.
Very intense.
All about keeping your inner cool.
Good, cos you were such a spaz before.
So that's it?
You keep your cool and no more wolfie?
No, there's more.
I take some herbs and stuff.
Some chanting.
A couple of charms.
It's incredible.
You've been all around the world.
You've had this complete mind/body transformation.
I've just been here.
Same old Sunnydale.
- Doesn't mean you've not gone through a lot.
- It's true.
Some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you and cursing your name.
- Not literally.
- Thanks for that.
And, I don't know, l I think I'm getting better at my spells and stuff.
- It's so light out.
- Yeah, we talked all night.
I believe a manly-sized breakfast is in order, don't you?
Or we could just sleep a little while.
Whatever you want.
I'll have the less confusing waffles right now.
Breakfast it is.
Let me just freshen up.
- Oh Sorry, I'll come back.
- Are you looking for Willow?
- She's just in the bathroom down the hall.
- No, no.
No, it's OK.
- I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
- Yeah.
Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the Scoobies.
Are you sure you don't wanna come in?
- What?
- Your friend came by.
The blonde girl.
But she wouldn't stay.
So what do you think?
Where do you wanna go?
- Morning.
- Morning.
Are those, like, regulation?
Do you have to do those every morning?
No.
It's just a good way to start the day.
Then you can have your perfectly balanced breakfast, and then you can call your mother.
OK, I've been up less than a minute and somehow I've managed to piss you off.
- I should go home.
- No.
Come on.
Is it that whole thing about Willow last night?
Look, I only said what I said because I'm concerned.
I don't wanna see her get hurt.
You sounded like Mr lnitiative: "Demons bad, people good".
Something wrong with that theorem?
There's different degrees of Evil?
It's just different with different demons.
There are creatures - vampires, for example - that aren't evil at all.
Name one.
Rye, we need you downstairs.
- The Beta team got hit.
- Bad?
We lost Willis.
- Graham?
- He's walking.
We're going on a hunt.
What kind of demon was it?
Does it matter?
- Hey.
- Hey.
You OK?
Yeah, I just I don't wanna talk about it.
I wanna hear about you and Oz.
You saw him, right?
- I was with him all night.
- All night?
Oh, my God.
Wait.
- Last night was a wolf moon, right?
- Yep.
- Either you're gonna say something kinky - No kink.
He didn't change, Buffy.
He said he was gonna find a cure and he did.
In Tibet.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.
OK, I'm all with the whoo-hoo here and you're not.
No, there's "whoo" and "hoo".
But there's "uh-oh" and "why now"?
And it's complicated.
Why complicated?
It's complicated because of Tara.
You mean Tara has a crush on Oz?
No, you Um, Well That's great.
You know, I mean, I think Tara's a really great girl, Will.
She is.
And there's something between us.
It wasn't something I was looking for.
It's just powerful.
And it's totally different from what Oz and I have.
Well, there you go.
I mean, you have to you have to follow your heart, Will.
And that's what's important, Will.
Why do you keep saying my name like that?
Like what, Will?
Are you freaked?
What?
No, Will No.
No.
Absolutely no to that question.
I'm glad you told me.
- What did you say to Oz?
- I was gonna tell him, but then we started hanging out and I could just feel everything coming back.
He's Oz, you know?
Yeah.
I know.
I don't wanna hurt anyone, Buffy.
No matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt.
And the important thing is you just have to be honest, or it's gonna be a lot worse.
From the sound ofthose massive mud flaps, I'd peg you as a demon, which means you're in for a world of pain.
Spike, I want you to come with me.
Do you?
Well, let's go then.
Come.
- You're going to help me with my problem.
- Why's that exactly?
I am going to help you with yours.
Hi.
Hi.
I can only stay for a minute.
I have class.
Me, too.
I have class, too.
I just want you to know that what you saw this morning, it wasn't No, it's OK.
I always knew that if he came back We were just talking.
Nothing happened.
Really?
But, you know, it was intense, just talking.
We have a lot to talk about.
I kinda feel like my head's gonna explode.
Whatever, you know, happens, I'll still be here.
I'll still be your friend.
Of course we'll be friends.
That's not even a question.
But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you.
How can you, when I'm not even sure?
I mean, I know what he meant to me.
But he left and everything changed.
I changed, and then we What?
I don't know.
I just Life was starting to get so good again, and you're a big part ofthat.
And here comes the thing I wanted most of all, and I don't know what to do.
I wanna know, but I don't.
Do what makes you happy.
Willow.
Hey.
I thought I sme heard Willow.
Hey.
You're you're coming back to school here, huh?
Pretty much feeling oddly motivated.
That's That's great.
I mean, that's great for you and Willow, right?
- I hope so.
- Good.
That's Because Is that her sweater?
I just hope that you guys'll be very happy.
You smell like her.
She's all over you, d'you know that?
I can't.
I I can't talk about this.
But there's something to talk about?
- Are you two involved?
- I have to I have to go.
Because she never said anything to me.
We talked all night, and she never No, stop.
Is she in love with you?
Tell me.
Is she?
Run.
- Are you OK?
- What's going on?
Looks like one ofthe demons that took out Graham's guys.
We'll take it back and make an ID.
- If it is, we'll put him down.
- You don't understand Listen, we know what we're doing.
You're in shock.
- But - We'll handle it.
No.
Well, that sounds like a lot offun.
You see my problem, though.
Total annihilation ofthe humans doesn't help me.
- I'll need heavy casualties on both sides.
- I get that.
- I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
- The humans need a leader.
A champion.
The Slayer can do that.
Yeah The thing about the Slayer is, she is whiny, but when it comes to the fighting she does have a tendency to win.
Then I guess you should be on her side.
This all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah?
No tricks?
Scout's honour.
- You were a Boy Scout?
- Parts of me.
What's up?
You OK?
Oz.
We were talking and he changed right in front of me.
- What?
It's daylight.
- I know, but it happened.
- Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Riley and the commando guys stopped him, but they don't know it's Oz.
- I tried to tell them, but they took him away.
- When?
Just now?
- I think they might hurt him.
- I have to go find Buffy.
I know.
Tara said they took him, right before she found me.
So that's good, right?
I mean, they probably haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.
An, you can help by making this a quiet time.
Again we're faced with the prospect of having to infiltrate the lnitiative.
It'd be great ifwe knew someone dating a man on the inside, with connections.
Wait.
He's still not answering his pages.
I left him another message.
- So what do we do?
- We need to move fast.
So we make a plan without Riley and hope he calls.
What's the word?
ls this the animal that took apart our men?
- We don't know yet.
- Why the delay?
Graham gave a description.
He described characteristics present in over 40 known varieties of demon.
- So we're crosschecking DNA evidence - And how long's that gonna take?
I have no idea.
I don't need a bunch oftests to know that this thing's a killer.
- Hey, he's coming to.
Oz.
- We gave him Haldol to keep him quiet.
- Why?
He's not a threat now.
- You only stay ifyou let us do our work.
Only Colonel McNamara can place a cease order on medical testing.
He said proceed.
I always suspected werewolftransformations being based on a lunar cycle was just talk.
That's enough.
He's a student.
I know him.
- Take him out.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go.
See that?
Transformation related to negative stimulation.
Something's wrong.
Riley usually returns my calls by now.
- We can't wait much longer.
- I know.
OK.
Xander, you and I are gonna go in.
We've done it before.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
It's too dangerous, Will.
You need to help Giles hack into the electrical grid and power down the lnitiative.
Giles can do it without me.
I can give him all the instructions, I can show him what to do.
- Of course.
- I can'tjust sit here.
OK.
OK, you can back us up.
You get into the lnitiative via the elevator in the Lowell House, but my clearance is gone.
- So we grab a guy, make him take us.
- Or you could just use the back way.
- Hell of a lot less bother.
- How did you get in?
The door was unlocked.
You might wanna watch that.
Someone dangerous could get in.
Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
Now, now.
None ofthat.
Or I won't help you get Red's mongrel back.
Bad news travels fast with us demons.
We all like a good laugh.
Short of cash, Spike?
I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah.
But I also get a kick out of jacking up those army ginks myself.
I know how to find the big guy who can take you to Oz.
Uh-huh.
So what's the going rate on a wild-goose chase, Spike?
Fine, ifyou're not interested.
But I was stuck in that hole, and I've heard things from guys who've gotten out.
I can get you in.
No alarms, no cameras, no waiting.
Oz.
Put these on, man.
Come on.
End ofthe line.
At ease.
- Permission to speak, Colonel.
- Denied.
Being new around here, Finn, I had a look at your record and Professor Walsh's notes.
Until recently you were an exemplary soldier headed for the top.
Then you meet this girl, this slayer, and suddenly begin to exhibit signs of disloyalty.
You abuse your command.
But tonight?
To release a lethal HST back into the population - Sir, the prisoner - You will speak when I tell you to.
Tomorrow I'll institute a court martial to investigate your involvement with the Slayer and her band offreaks.
They're anarchists, Finn.
Too backwards for the real world.
You help us take them down and you just might save your military career.
Otherwise, you'll go to your grave labelled a traitor.
No woman's worth that.
I mentioned I'd kill you ifthis is a scam, right?
- Look, would I wear this if it was?
- You do sort of look like an evil olive.
Guys?
Check it out.
For a nasty town like Sunnydale, nobody seems to mind their locks.
You first.
Try tapping in "XH4J7" for the emergency shutdown command.
That covers the entire electrical grid for the university and outlying area.
Slap my hand now.
- Beg your pardon?
- In celebration.
Yes.
You know who I am?
- Yeah.
- Then you know I'm pretty good with this.
Take us to him.
Finn stays in the brig.
Helping an HST escape is a court-martial offence.
You'll make matters worse.
Riley tried to help Oz escape?
That's who you came for.
- The wolf.
- Guess we're two for one.
Get dressed.
Hey, you dropped - How'd you get in?
- Talk later.
Stealthy escape now.
Buffy.
I leave now, I can't ever come back.
I just wanted to hear that out loud.
Hold it.
Stay back, or I'll pull a "William Burroughs" on your leader here.
You'll bore him to death with free prose?
Was I the only one awake in English that day?
I'll kill him.
Get him out.
- Oz.
- Willow, get back.
Let's go.
You're a dead man, Finn.
No, sir.
I'm an anarchist.
I hope everybody else is OK.
It was better to split up, right?
I mean, we're just too findable in a big clump.
It was better.
Besides, I think it's mostly me the lnitiative wants now.
Probably.
So what shall we do?
We'll be safe for tonight at least.
The camps are still blacked out, so that oughta slow the lnitiative down.
I'll figure out my next move tomorrow.
Quite a day, huh?
You woke up to a big bowl ofWheaties.
Now you're a fugitive.
I don't know.
I'm sorry it ended that way, but I am glad it's done.
I'm glad I know where I stand, finally.
I was wrong about Oz.
I was being a bigot.
No, you weren't.
You were thrown.
You found out that Willow was in kind of an unconventional relationship, and it gave you momentary wiggins.
It happens.
Still, I was in a totally black-and-white space - people versus monsters.
And it ain't like that.
Especially when it comes to love.
I have to tell you some stuff, about my past.
And it's not all stuffthat you're gonna like.
You can tell me anything.
I think so.
I think I can.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Get dressed.
- Finn stays in the brig.
Helping an HST escape is a court-martial offence.
- You'll make matters worse.
- Talk later.
Stealthy escape now.
Buffy.
I leave now, I can't ever come back.
Spike, come with me.
You're going to help me with my problem.
I'm going to help you with yours.
- You have to be with the person you love.
- I am.
It's complicated because of Tara.
Are you freaked?
I have to tell you some stuff about my past.
And it's not all stuffyou're gonna like.
And on "Angel": You didn't think I'd find you, did you?
- This won't happen.
- You'll stop me?
- Don't.
- Faith, go.
Don't you move a I have someone in my life now, that I love.
You don't know me now, so don't come here with your new life and expect me to do things your way.
Go home.
- And the men?
- These are exceptional boys.
Their capture ratio just keeps increasing.
They're keeping it together.
Morale's a problem.
The death of Professor Walsh, the escape ofthe prototype Controlling the HSTs is getting harder.
We have overcrowding in the containment areas.
- Quite a mess.
- It's not my mess, sir.
I'm just holding the fort while you figure out what you wanna do with the place.
This incident with Finn was unfortunate.
Fell in with a bad crowd.
Frankly, I don't think he was ever the soldier you all hoped he was.
- Boy thinks too much.
- Nevertheless, we wanthim back.
- The government's invested - We'll catch up to him.
My feeling is he won't stray too far from the girl.
Yes Buffy Summers.
Our data banks don'thave much on her.
She's just a girl.
She's a lot more than that.
- The Slayer's dangerous.
- Yes.
She makes things interesting.
No.
See, you're not getting it, Mr Bits.
You're gonna be interestingly dead.
Little Miss Tiny bollockses up the plans of every would-be unstoppable bad-ass who sets foot in this town.
I just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, the Slayer's gonna be right in the thick of it.
- You ready for that?
- I'm counting on it.
- Two slayers.
- That's right.
- And you killed them both?
- Yeah.
- I killed the hell out ofthem.
- Yet you fear this one?
Watch it, mate.
I don't fear anything, just know my enemies.
Do you?
Then why haven't you killed this slayer yet?
Because.
Stinking rotten luck is why.
On top ofthat, now I've got this buggering chip up my head.
Yes.
Your behaviour-modification circuitry.
I know what you feel.
- Not likely.
- You feel smothered.
Trapped like an animal, pure in its ferocity, unable to actualise the urges within.
Clinging to one truth.
Like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosed glass.
That a beast this powerful cannot be contained.
Inevitably it will break free and savage the land again.
I will make you whole again.
Make you savage.
Wow.
I mean, yeah.
I get why the demons all fall in line with you.
You're like Tony Robbins, if he was a big, scary Frankenstein-looking You're exactly like Tony Robbins.
I will restore you to what you once were, when I have the Slayer how and where I want her.
Easier said.
She's crafty, her and her little friends.
- Friends?
- There's your What do you call it?
Variable.
The Slayer's got pals.
You want even odds in a fight?
You don't want the Slayerettes about.
Take them away from her.
Now, there's a plan.
Working solo, she won't have a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins.
Plus, it'll make her miserable.
And I never get tired ofthat.
Yeah.
Leave 'em to me.
You can't hurt them.
What can you do to make sure they're out ofthe picture?
Not a blessed thing.
They're gonna do it for me.
Know if she's back yet?
LA Woman?
Haven't heard from her.
She'll probably come here first thing, though.
Who's your buddy?
So you don't have to be GI Joe while your civvies are gettin' washed.
Try those on.
You'll feel like a new man.
Would this man have a bright red nose and big, floppy feet?
- I'm sorry.
That's the cabin fever talking.
- But as post-apocalypse splendour goes - I've done wonders with the place.
- Yeah.
Still, the sooner Buffy gets back, the better I'll feel.
You and me both, big guy.
I take it you're not an Angel fan either?
Well, it's not like I hate the guy.
Just, you know, the guts part of him.
Can't blame you.
But to be fair, it's not him you hate.
It's the curse.
Right?
What did Buffy tell you?
About Angel?
Everything.
More than I wanted to know sometimes.
She loved him.
He turned evil.
He killed people.
She cured him.
He left.
- Interesting little curse.
- One moment's happiness.
- What do you mean?
- You know, it's his trigger.
Angel's an OK guy, if he's mopy and sad and brooding, but you give him even one second of pure, real pleasure - And that sets him off?
- Only in a kill-your-friends kind ofway.
And you know what makes Angel happiest?
I'll give you a hint.
It's not crème brûlée.
Buffy.
Sex with Buffy.
She kind of left that part out?
Yeah, she did.
That explains a lot ofthings that I wish weren't explained.
That's all ancient history.
She went running to LA to bone up on her history.
No.
I'm sure it's boneless.
She just needs to make sure everything's OK.
She's probably back already.
Maybe.
You'll feel a lot better when you see her.
I guess we'll see.
lf I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me?
Well, I must be travelling on now There's too many places I've got to see And if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same Cos I'm as free as a bird now For someone who's got "watcher" on his résumé, you might wanna cast an eye to the front door every now and again.
What do you want?
Knew I left one.
- Buffy around?
- Why?
I need to speak to the lady ofthe house.
Be a pet and give her a message.
Tell her I might have something she might want.
And what might that something be?
Information.
Highly classified.
Not cheap word-on-the-street prattle.
I'm talking about the good stuff.
Thrill me.
It's nothing I know.
Think I'd come running over saying, "I've got a secret, beat me till I talk"?
There's files in the lnitiative.
I'm pretty sure I know where.
- Files?
- Yeah.
Secrets.
Mission statements.
Design schematics.
All of Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots oftidbits about - Adam.
- Well, yeah.
Say someone was to risk his life and limb Iimb, anyway, to obtain said files.
It might be worth a little something.
At this point a cynical person might think that you were offering just what we need when we need it most.
That person'd be right, Rupert.
Supply and demand.
- And it won't be cheap this time.
- What do you want?
A year's supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merry bushels of cash and, most important, a guarantee that I'm not to be in any way slain.
Done.
With a smile and a nod from you?
Sorry.
Not close to good enough.
This deal's with the Slayer.
- I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her?
Great comfort, that.
What makes you think she'll listen to you?
Because.
- Very convincing.
- I'm her watcher.
I think you're neglecting the past tense there, Rupert.
Besides, she barely listened to you when you were in charge.
- I've seen the way she treats you.
- Yes?
And how's that?
Very much like a retired librarian.
I've got what she wants as long as she has what I want.
Spread the word.
She knows where to find me.
I'll think about it.
I keep thinking "OK, that's the cutest thing ever".
And then she does something cuter and completely resets the whole scale.
- Did you see her yawn earlier?
- Yes.
I thought I was gonna die.
- I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico.
- We've got to get her a real name.
It's so cool that she's ours.
Yours.
That she's yours is cool.
She can be ours ifyou want.
You still need an elective.
How about sophomore-level psychology?
Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh.
Maybe something fun like drama.
I could be dramatic.
You cannot have more catnip.
You have a catnip problem.
Definitely drama.
I haven't even dealt with the housing situation yet.
Have you done anything?
I hear there's some off-campus places that are cool for groups to go in on.
I just figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again.
We haven't really talked about it.
I used to assume we'd be roomies through grad school, well into little-old-ladyhood.
You know, cheatin' at bingo together and forgettin' to take our pills.
But?
But I don't know.
It hardly feels like we're roomies now.
She's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too.
I guess I should ask her.
- Riley.
- I got a little tired of sitting around waiting.
- So - You joined the circus?
Xander took my clothes to clean 'em.
Left me these.
Does he hate me in some way I don't know about yet?
I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform.
Is it OK for you to be here?
You tell me.
I just meant with the government branch hunting you down and all.
I'm good.
It took me a while, but I patched into their frequency.
- Can't sneak up on a guy if he's listening in.
- You're the sneakiest.
Why they hired me.
You OK?
Yeah.
I just - Angel kind of upset me.
- How?
- It's not that interesting.
- Got my attention.
He just spun my head a little.
You don't wanna talk about it.
Deconstructing Angel can wait.
Right now I just wanna get out there and patrol and find Adam.
We can talk about it later.
It's the pants, isn't it?
It's OK.
I couldn't take me seriously in these either.
Riley, it's not that big a deal.
Why don't I get out ofyour face?
You had a long trip.
- You don't have to go.
- It's OK.
Besides, I have to recharge them every two hours or they go dead on me.
OK.
Here.
You should've saved the ensemble from last time.
- I'm not a clothing delivery service.
- He is, kind of.
He did Riley yesterday.
Hello.
This is just swell.
Gotta say, liking this quite a lot.
Kinda changes the balance of power Come on.
You gotta be kidding.
That chip in your head means you can't even point a gun?
How humiliating.
Doesn't work anyway.
It's a fake.
- Not even a decorative gun?
- Give it up for American chipmanship.
It doesn't work?
What about self-defence?
I'm taking a risk here, you know.
Can I tell you how much I really don't care?
Attitude.
See how far that'll take you in boot camp.
I hope you get one ofthose tough-as-nails drill sergeants who's only hard on the men to keep them alive when the bullets start flying.
- I love that stuff.
- Boot camp?
Yeah, like, I'd go there.
What, you changed your mind?
Not gonnajoin?
- You're joining the army?
- OK.
One: Ow.
Two: Where'd you get that idea?
Three: Ow.
- I'm notjoining the army.
- Good.
Stopped that nonsense just in time.
I was never Who'd you hear this from?
Your girlie mates were talking.
Something about being all you can be.
Or all you can be.
You know, having a laugh.
Figured you were signin' up.
Have you got anything larger in the toy-gun line?
Can you believe this?
Like I'm some sort of useless lunk.
It happens I'm good at a lot ofthings.
I help out with all kinds of stuff.
I have skills and stratagems.
I'm very Help me out.
- He's a Viking in the sack.
- Terrific.
You didn't have these cleaned.
This is so like them, lately.
It's all about them and the college life.
You know what college is?
It's high school only without the actual going to class.
High school was kinda like that, too.
The point is, I'm working hard to make a living.
It's nothing but a huge joke to them.
"Xander got fired from Starbucks.
Xander got fired from that phone-sex line".
- They look down on you.
- And they hate you.
- But they don't look down on me.
- It was just a laugh.
There's no need to go insane over it.
- Is anybody talking to you?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Don't shoot.
- Give me a reason not to.
- You're killing humans now?
- Not yet.
Beating you senseless should do.
I can have a patrol here in under a minute.
Here's the plan.
You go your way, I'll go mine.
- I'm checking out that cave.
- My orders exactly.
- Alone?
- We're spread a little thin, so yeah.
- Family's tearing apart.
- Family?
What kind offamily are you?
Corleones?
Weren't until you showed up.
What?
No girls in the club?
You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's had?
A big head on that skinny body.
No.
You're just the first to get him to commit treason.
Riley had a career.
He had a future till he met you, and yeah, I got a problem with that.
A future?
A future doing what?
Illegal experiments?
Torture?
Murder?
- So killing someone isn't a problem for you?
- Less and less.
Get the hell out before l Touch me and you'll see what slayer strength is like.
- I think it's about time you showed me, then.
- Yes.
I think that would be interesting.
Get out of here.
I'm not moving.
- Thank you.
- Go.
Get out.
No.
- I think I lost the buggers.
- Any luck with the disk?
I took what they had.
Should be something useful on one of 'em.
- Hope so.
- What are we looking for?
- Anything about Adam.
- Any problems getting in and out?
No.
A couple ofthem made me on the way out, but I took care of 'em.
Gave them a good running-away-from, did you?
Yeah.
When do I get paid?
When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful.
I could've gone straight to the Slayer, you know.
I let you pretend you're in charge.
Now you need Red's permission to finish the deal?
As soon as we see what's on the disks.
- It looks like gibberish.
- Gibberish?
- They're encrypted.
- Wonderful.
Can you fix 'em?
Crack a government encryption code on my laptop?
Easy as really difficult pie.
You're not exactly the whiz these days either.
God, I'm never gonna get paid.
- I am a whiz.
- She is a whiz.
If ever a whiz there was.
I just need some time.
No.
I just heard you weren't Your mates said you weren't playing with computers so much.
Into the new thing.
- What new thing?
- You know, you two.
- The whole Wicca thing.
- They were talking about that?
Can we get back to business?
I've got a deal at stake.
- What did they say?
- That it's a phase.
You'll get over it.
What?
Who said that?
Was it Buffy?
Cos, you know what she means by No, she was defending you cos Xander said you were just being trendy.
- Trendy?
- I don't know what they were going on about.
A person wants to be a witch, that's their business.
- I knew Buffy was freaked.
- You should talk to her.
I'm sure Pressing business, ladies.
Don't wanna get sidetracked.
Still got your monsters to fight.
Cell capacity maxed out three days ago, sir.
At this pace, there'll be nowhere to contain the hostiles.
They're animals.
We pack 'em in until we're out of room, then we pack 'em in some more.
- They'll start tearing each other apart, sir.
- I have no problem with that scenario.
Backup.
Requestimmediate backup.
Over.
They're tearing us apart overhere.
Two men down.
Come out ofnowhere.
Mayday.
Repeat.
Mayday.
Immediate backup.
We're in the alleybehind the schoolbuilding.
Where the hell is Back.
Fallback.
It's coming.
Riley Finn.
I know you?
We have a friend in common.
Angel.
Welcoming committee your idea?
The way I heard it, you were all peaceable now.
You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
Don't push me, boy.
Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy that would make you lose your soul?
That'd be between me and her.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see an old girlfriend.
- You think I'll let that happen?
- Think you can stop me?
I surely do.
- Angel.
- Hi.
Can I come in?
I guess.
I need a little more than that.
Come in.
- You're hurt.
- You too.
I'll live.
Wanna tell me who ran your face into a doorknob?
Not really.
It's not world-in-peril stuff.
Let me guess.
You thought of something else really hurtful to say and couldn't use the phone because the funniest part is the look on my face Buffy, please.
I really don't have a lot oftime.
What's going on?
I told you you weren't coming near her.
You've got to be kidding me.
This is why you came?
No.
This was an accident.
Running your car into a tree is an accident.
Running your fist into a face is a plan.
- Please explain this to me.
- Put that gun down.
It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinkin' not.
He attacked four of my men, Buffy.
He's up to his old tricks.
- He won't hurt anybody.
Tell him.
- Might hurt you.
- Please try.
- Some threat.
You can barely stand.
- Trigger finger feels OK.
- You actually sleep with this guy?
OK, stop it!
That is enough!
I see one more display oftestosterone poisoning and I'll put you both in hospital.
Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
He started Riley.
I'm sorry.
Just wanted to know that you were safe.
I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
- What?
- Riley, please.
I'm not leaving this room.
I mean it.
I'm not movin' a muscle.
OK.
I come to see you, to help you, and you treat me like I'm just your ex.
- Technically - Shut up.
Then you order me out ofyour city.
Then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?
I would really like to know: what the hell are you trying to do?
I was trying to make things better.
- It's goin' pretty good, don't you think?
- Swell.
I couldn't leave it like that.
The way I spoke to you.
I came to apologise.
I had no right.
And Riley?
I gotjumped by some soldiers.
He came in in the middle.
He wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit ofthe doubt.
Put yourself in his place.
I get it.
You weren't entirely wrong, what you said in LA.
We don't live in each other's worlds any more.
I had no right to barge in on yours and make judgments.
I'm still sorry.
Thank you.
And next time I'll apologise by phone.
Things are pretty tense around here.
- They really are.
- Can I do anything?
Honestly?
I think the best thing you can do right now is OK.
It means a lot that you came.
- Riley?
- Yeah?
I don't like him.
Thank you.
Now that was fun.
You were successful?
- Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too.
- You're sure?
I feel it in my bones.
Call it "the Yoko Factor".
Don't tell me you've never heard ofthe Beatles?
I have.
I like "Helter Skelter".
What a surprise.
The point is, they were once a real powerful group.
It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world.
When they broke up, everyone blamed Yoko.
But the group split itself apart.
She just happened to be there.
You know how it is with kids.
They go offto college and grow apart.
The way ofthe world.
So you separated the Slayer from her friends.
I'm pleased.
Since we've got all our ducks in a row and not talking to each other, I guess it's time for the grand plan.
The one where I get the chipectomy?
You got everything you need?
No.
There's one more thing.
How bad are you hurt?
Don't know yet.
Night's still young.
Riley, I have to tell you something.
- Figured.
- Maybe you wanna sit down.
I'm fine.
- Riley, l - Wait.
Me first.
Buffy I feel like we've gotten really close.
At least, I thought we had.
I don't know much about Angel or your relationship with him.
But all I ask is, ifyou're gonna break my heart, do it fast.
What?
- You think that Angel and l - Didn't you?
No.
Of course not.
How can you even ask me that?
- I don't know.
Xander said - Xander?
- He's the deadest man in Deadonia.
- No.
It's not his fault.
I prodded, and he explained how Angel went bad.
The trigger.
After that, I went a little nuts.
On the one hand, I should believe in us.
But, on the other, sometimes things happen between exes and when I saw he was bad He's not bad.
Seriously?
That's a good day?
There you go.
Even when he's good, he's all Mr Billowy-Coat King of Pain.
- Girls really like that - Riley, stop.
See?
Nuts.
Have I ever given you any reason to feel that you can't trust me?
No.
Then why with the crazy?
Because I'm so in love with you I can't think straight.
Tell me about it.
Riley.
I still have to tell you something.
- And there's no easy way to - Just say it.
Forrest is dead.
I'm so sorry.
There was a fight.
Adam killed him.
I barely got away.
I know there's nothing that I can say that's gonna make this better.
But we will find this thing and destroy it.
I have to go.
- Are you sure?
- I have to go now.
It's still encrypted.
Willow's working really hard on it.
OK.
How long before you uncrypt it?
Hours.
Days, maybe.
Anyone suggesting months would not be accused of crazy talk.
Whatever happened to Latin?
At least when that made no sense, the Church approved.
I can't wait around, Will.
The disk is no good to me unless you crack it soon.
We worked really hard getting that.
- Xander delivered clothing.
- Church-approved.
Sorry, you guys.
We're on a clock here.
Adam was at that cave, so maybe he was there for a reason.
I could go back, scope it out, track him if I have to.
Right.
Then maybe you'll get lucky and he'll still be there.
He can rip your arms offfor you.
Buffy, you can't go back alone.
You never train with me.
He'll kick your arse.
- Giles.
- Sorry.
Was it a bit honest?
Terribly sorry.
So she doesn't go alone.
Giles, weapons all around.
You're not going, Xander.
You'd get hurt.
OK, you and Willow do the superpower thing.
I'll putt around the Batcave with Alfred here.
No, I am no Alfred, sir.
No, you forget.
Alfred had ajob.
Willow is not going either.
I'm doing it alone.
Great.
And then, when you have your new "no arms", we can say "It's a good thing we didn't get in the way ofthat".
Maybe we can help in other ways.
Want some new fighting pants, Buff?
- You guys, this isn't helping.
- Wow.
We're already in the way.
We're good at this.
I'm so good you might have to ship me offto the army to get me out ofthe way.
- The army?
- You didn't know I knew, did ya?
- You two talking about me behind my back.
- Us talking about you?
How about you telling Riley every last detail of my life with Angel?
Besides, when is there any "us two"?
You two are the two who are "the two".
I'm the other one.
But maybe that all changes when I'm doing sit-ups over at Fort Dix?
Fort Dix?
- Are you drunk?
- Yes.
Quite a bit, actually.
Stop it.
- This is stupid.
- Stupid?
You finally had the guts to say it to my face.
I didn't say you were stupid.
So stop being an idiot and let me fix this.
OK, I need you.
I need both ofyou, all the time.
Just not now.
- Adam is very dangerous.
- Wait.
How do you need me, really?
You're good with the computer stuff, usually.
- And there's the witch stuff.
- "Witch stuff"?
- What exactly do you mean by "witch stuff"?
- You guys, what is happening?
This is crazy.
No, it's not.
It's all finally making perfect sense.
I'm not going to miss a moment of it.
You think this'll go on for a while?
Hard to say.
- Nice bathroom.
- Like the tile.
If I did join the army, I'd be great.
You know why?
I might get ajob that couldn't be done by a Border collie.
- That's it.
I'm going to bed.
- You'd do wonderful in the army.
Think the umbilical cord between you and Anya could stretch that far?
I knew it.
I knew you hated her.
I'm not the one being judgmental here.
- I'll leave that to you and Buffy.
- Judgmental?
If I was any more open-minded about the choices you make my brain would fall out.
And superior.
Don't forget that.
You may be better than us.
It doesn't mean you can be superior.
You guys, stop this.
What happened to you today?
It's not today.
Buffy, things have been wrong for a while.
- Don't you see that?
- What do you mean, wrong?
They certainly haven't been right, since Tara.
We have to face it.
You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend.
No.
It was bad before that.
Since you two went offto college and forgot about me.
Just left me in the basement to Tara's your girlfriend?
- Bloody hell.
- Enough.
All I know is, you wanna help, right?
Be part ofthe team?
- I don't - No, you said you wanted to go.
So let's go.
All of us.
We'll go to the cave with you two attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoe.
Maybe that's the secret way to kill Adam.
- Buffy - Is that it?
ls that how you can help?
You're not answering me.
How can you possibly help?
So I guess I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One and her friends.
If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on.
I've been waiting for you.
And now I'm here.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Almost time to wake up and take your first look at the world.
I know you're gonna make me proud.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": Adam?
Spike, I want you to come with me.
You're going to help me with my problem.
- The Slayer's got pals.
- Take them away from her.
- This all goes down, the chip comes out.
- Scout's honour.
Riley had a career.
He had a future till he met you, and yeah, I got a problem with that.
Thank you.
Adam was at that cave so maybe he was there for a reason.
I'll go back, scope it out - You never train with me.
He'll kick your arse.
- Giles!
Stupid?
You finally had the guts to say it to my face.
- What do you mean by "witch stuff"?
- You guys, what is happening?
Buffy, things have been wrong for a while.
I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One and her friends.
If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on.
- I've been waiting for you.
- And now I'm here.
Riley?
Riley?
Your thoughts are troubled.
In turmoil.
I understand, brother.
We have a lot to discuss.
- Speak.
- What have you done to me?
Nothing.
It was Mother.
Your Professor Walsh.
She implanted the behaviour modifier.
- A chip in my head.
She really did it.
- Actually, the chip is here.
Tied directly into your central nervous system through the thoracic nerve.
This is phase one ofyour preparation.
It lay dormant until now.
I simply activated it, brother.
Stop calling me that.
I'm not your brother.
You're a botched science experiment and I'm a human being, - who'll do everything in his power - Sit.
You have no power.
Not yet.
Once you forget your old life and embrace your destiny, as I have, you will know power you have never dreamed of.
I think you're going to like it.
Demons cling to old ways and ancient feuds.
And they're hopeless with technology.
- Unworthy.
- Not really wanting a lecture right now.
Disappointed by demonkind, we turn to humans.
Smart, adaptive, but emotional and weak.
Blind.
There's imperfection everywhere.
Something must be done.
Who will deliver us?
Mother.
She saw our future.
Yours and mine.
She saw that you are necessary.
She saw the role that you will play by my side.
Stand up.
You see, we are brothers after all.
It warms the cockles of my non-beating heart, seeing you lads together.
I didn't send for you, Spike.
Yeah, well, I'm not much the "being sent for" type.
I'm much more the "I did my part, now get this chip out of my head" kinda guy.
Slightly stiffer than usual.
Subtle, but I like it.
- What's with him?
- I activated his chip.
Oh.
So it's chips all around, is it?
Someone must've bought the party pack.
You get yours removed when the Slayer is where I want her.
She's separated from her friends.
They want nothing to do with her.
She's all alone.
That's how I want her.
Where I want her is down in the lnitiative.
She will ensure that as many demons die as humans.
She will achieve maximum carnage before she's too weak to go on.
- No.
You can't - Stop talking.
Right.
The lnitiative.
But getting her there - that's what the disks are for, innit?
The witch gives her the info and Alice heads back down the rabbit hole.
- The witch?
- Willow.
About so high, perky, good with maths.
A natural choice.
- Her friend.
- Right.
One ofthose from whom you so efficiently separated her.
Damn right I did.
They won't be talking to each other for a long, long Hang on.
I think I might've detected a small flaw.
So you failed.
Well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart.
You let me plan this thing.
Let's not quibble.
The important thing is making sure the Slayer is where we want - Go.
- Gone.
So we'll do this chip thing when I get back.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Oh.
Pardon the robe.
It's a bit of a late start.
Right.
- I hope you're feeling all right, Mr Giles.
- Oh, quite well, thank you.
Yes, I'll probably have a briskjog later on.
- Did you want something?
- I forgot my laptop and the disks.
Yes.
Please, please, come in.
Will you be working here?
You know, typing, talking?
Because that will be fine.
No.
That's OK.
Got 'em.
So see ya.
Right.
Yes, well, good luck with that.
OK.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Xander?
You wanted to check the board at the unemployment office this morning.
You can't go like that.
They won't even interview you ifyou're naked.
I'm not goin'.
There's never anything good.
- Maybe I shouldjoin the army.
- Don't they make you get up really early?
Oh, yeah.
Never mind.
Are you still upset about that fight you had with your friends?
It was hours ago!
- Get over it.
- Anya, you Forget it.
So they all think you're a lost, directionless loser with no plans for his future.
Pfft!
- Anya, you can't pfft that stuff away.
- Why not?
I don't know.
Cos I think maybe they're right.
So what ifthey are?
You're a good person and a good boyfriend and and I'm in love with you.
Whatever they think ofyou, it shouldn't matter.
Yeah.
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Adam.
Where are you?
This is where it will all happen.
Where the new race begins.
- Where are we?
- In the lnitiative.
There are areas no one knew about beyond those that needed to.
Mother kept her secrets well.
Didn't you?
- Professor Walsh?
- This is all how she planned it, except she thought she would be alive.
Are you - Is that what you're gonna do to me?
- They're just workers.
You know your destiny is much greater.
Forrest.
Oh, God.
God has nothing to do with it.
Easy, sheriff.
Watch where you point that thing.
What are you doing here?
Looking for a little weekend getaway place.
Shove off.
Adam's been using these caves.
- What?
- I found his lair.
Oh, cripes.
That's all I need - running into that goon.
Adam's cleared out of here.
Something is about to go down.
Look at little Nancy Drew.
What about those disks I nabbed?
They ought to tell you something.
- Willow has the disks.
- Well, I'd get on that.
Can't ignore valuable information just cos you two birds fell out, can you?
- Right.
- Well, you do what you want.
No worry of mine now, is it?
- Maybe you should rest.
Clear your head?
- Can't.
Not now.
I think I'm on to something.
I've been assuming that the cipher text was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm.
- Then it hit me.
A hexagonic key pattern.
- Hey, look, you did it!
I didn't.
I haven't even finished typing in the new code.
Something's doing it.
Must be programmed to self-decrypt at a certain point.
That is so annoying!
It's like somebody blurting out the answer to a riddle just when you've I mean, yippee!
We have the information.
I don't know if "yippee" is the right response either.
Read that.
Hello?
Yeah, she's right I mean, let me check.
It's Buffy.
Professor Walsh.
Professor Walsh, it's Riley Finn.
- Can you hear me?
- She's dead.
Artificially reanimated with basic to moderate brain activity.
Mommy can hear you, but she's still a walking corpse.
- So are you.
- Mm-mm.
Got that wrong.
I'm surging with life, and strength.
Adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is.
Really lookin' forward to tryin' out your girl again.
- I'm sorry, Forrest.
- Don't be.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me.
I'm free of all my weaknesses, and my doubts.
He's gonna fix you up, too.
Soon as we got some choice parts.
Then you and me will be back on the same side, moving toward a new future.
- I'll never let that happen.
- You don't have a choice, brother.
- Your will belongs to us now.
- No.
That's not true.
Then why don't you get out ofthat chair and walk out?
- You can't control my - Riley, be a good boy.
Where's Anya?
Oddly, Anya decided not to join us, despite all the fun we had at our last meeting.
And I don't think Tara felt welcome.
Why?
Because ofthe things that we said?
Who told you we were talking behind your back, specifically?
Well, l Spike, specifically, but And who told you we thought you should join the army?
That's not exactlywhat he said.
Well, Spike can be very convincing when - I'm very stupid.
- He played us.
He wanted us to fight to split us up.
That's where it came from - the stuffwe said the other night.
Of course.
Well, piffle.
Let's move on.
- I'm movin'.
- Me, too.
Good.
Great.
So, why do you think Spike made with the head games?
He's all dressed up with no one to bite.
Gotta get his ya-yas somehow.
I think it was more than that.
I think it was Adam.
Spike's working for Adam?
After all we've done for Nah.
I can't even act surprised.
I just went to Adam's lair and he was gone.
But Spike just happened to be there.
He made a big noise about getting information offthe disks.
Oh.
I decrypted 'em.
Well, they decrypted themselves, but I almost had it.
- What did they say?
- A bunch of stuffwe already knew about 314.
But it also said there's some final phase where Adam manufactures a bunch of creepy cyberdemonoids like him.
There's a special lab in the lnitiative, but it didn't say where.
Adam fed Spike those disks.
It has to be.
He wanted me to know about his evil-guy assembly line.
- This lab, it's in the lnitiative?
- Hidden somewhere.
I'll give the demon his due.
He thought this one out.
What do you mean?
Think how overcrowded the containment cells are in the lnitiative.
Those demons were just too easy to catch.
It's like they wanted in that place.
The Trojan Horse.
Adam's making sure the demons attack the lnitiative from the inside.
Demons versus soldiers.
Massacre, massacre.
And Adam has a neat pile of body parts to start assembling his army.
Diabolical, yet gross.
Does anybody else miss the mayor - "I just wanna be a big snake"?
I've gotta shut him down.
His final phase is about to start.
- We need to warn the lnitiative.
- They're not gonna listen to me.
- Riley?
- He's a deserter.
He got some bad news anyway and kinda took off.
OK, I'm confused again.
Adam has this evil plan.
Why is he so anxious for you to know about it?
He wants me there.
Probably figures I'll even the kill ratio.
He's not worried you might kill, oh say him?
No.
He's really not.
She's coming.
I can feel it.
Good on you.
Got a chunk of prognosticating demon in there, eh?
Now, ifyou'll just get this chip out of my cranium, I'll be out ofyour way.
Mind the hairline.
I don't fancy fussing with a comb-over once I resume my killing ways.
- Come on.
We had a deal.
- When she's here.
There's certainly no lack of supplies.
I only wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.
Riley said his power source is a uranium core embedded inside his chest.
Probably near the spine.
Great.
So we just ask him to lie down quietly while we do some exploratory surgery.
What about magic?
Some kinda I don't know uranium-extracting spell?
- I know.
I'm reaching.
- Perhaps a paralysing spell.
- Only I can't perform the incantation ofthis.
- Right.
Don't you have to speak it in Sumerian or something?
I do speak Sumerian.
But it's not that.
Only an experienced witch can incant it within striking distance ofthe subject.
See what you get for taking French and not Sumerian?
- What was I thinking?
- So no problem.
All we need is Combo Buffy.
Her with slayer strength, Giles's multilingual know-how and Willow's witchy power.
Yeah.
Don't tell me.
I'm just full of helpful suggestions.
As a matter offact, you are.
- Nervous?
- No way.
I'm full ofthat good old kamikaze spirit.
Just because this will never work, don't be negative.
The spell isn't powerful enough to defeat Adam?
It's very powerful.
It's also extraordinarily dangerous.
Game faces, guys.
We're going in.
- How you doin'?
- Super.
What was I thinking, using stairs all this time?
OK.
- Will - No, really.
It's not as scary as I thought.
No.
That's not what I was gonna say.
I just I'm sorry.
I hate that things have been so strained between all of us.
It's not your fault.
Spike stirred up trouble.
Yeah, but I think trouble was stir-upable.
I think we've all sort of drifted apart this year, don't you?
Maybe a little.
But, you know, first year of college, it's hard to keep the old high-school gang together.
But I want it together.
Will, I miss you.
And Giles and Xander.
And it is my fault.
I've been so wrapped up in my own stuff, I've been a bad friend.
You're the Slayer.
Your stuff is pretty crucial.
I mean Riley, and Riley, mostly.
Well, I haven't been Miss Available either.
I kept secrets.
I hid things from everyone.
That's not your fault.
Will, you were going through something huge.
I wanted to tell you, but I was so scared.
You can tell me anything.
I love you.
- You're my best friend.
- Me, too.
- I love you, too.
- Oh!
Falling now.
- Let's promise to never not talk again.
- I promise, I promise.
- Xander.
- Oh, wonderful Xander!
- You know we love you, right?
- We totally do.
- Oh, God.
We're gonna die, aren't we?
- No.
We just missed you.
Giles, hurry up!
You definitely wanna get down here for this!
OK.
We stick together and everything should be fine.
Everybody ready?
Let's do this.
It's Must See TV.
Bait's been taken.
Trap's all set.
The Slayer has landed.
So.
One chiperectomy, please.
- Hello?
Paging Dr Owe-me-one.
- She's not alone.
You've failed me again.
- Well, that's one way of looking at it.
- What's the other way?
Oh, come on!
It's not like I wasn't trying.
That's worth something, isn't it?
I suppose.
Yes.
I will honour our agreement and remove your chip.
Take his head off.
Let him go.
There's nowhere left to run.
- Colonel.
- Shut up.
- You got some nerve, lady.
- You have to listen.
You think you and your friends can waltz into a government installation brandishing weapons like - Iike - It's a gourd.
It's a magic gourd.
What kind offreaks are you people?
- Adam is here, Colonel.
In the lnitiative.
- Nice try.
Those overcrowded cells?
Courtesy ofAdam.
He's pulling a Trojan Horse on you.
Every inch ofthis installation is under constant 24-hour surveillance.
- Including the secret lab?
- Including everything.
- What secret lab?
- The one Adam's been using.
The one built for the final stage ofthe 314 project.
- You have no idea what I'm talking about.
- I know everything that goes on around here.
A tick on a mouse couldn't get in without my knowing.
- IfAdam wants to try, we're ready for him.
- Oh, jolly good.
How exactly do you plan to get close enough to Adam to remove his power source?
Hit him simultaneously with multiple Taser blasters.
Incapacitate him with as much voltage as we can muster.
Great plan.
That's right up there with "duck and cover".
I've seen Adam hit with Taser blasts.
He feeds on it.
And you're giving him an all-you-can-eat buffet?
- You telling me my business?
- This is notyour business.
It's mine.
You, the lnitiative, the boys at the Pentagon - you're all in way over your heads.
Messing with primeval forces you have no comprehension of.
- And you do?
- I'm the Slayer.
You're playing on my turf.
Up there, maybe.
But down here, I'm the one who's in control.
Sir, the power grid's down.
Backup's not responding.
We're locked in.
This will be interesting.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Go!
Containment area has been breached.
Hostiles are loose.
How many?
- All ofthem, sir.
- It's Adam.
I'm the only one that can stop him.
Let me handle this.
Get your people out of here.
You men follow me.
We gotta take the armoury now.
- Sir.
- Colonel.
- These people are under arrest.
Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- We've gotta find Adam.
- On it.
The enjoining spell is extremely volatile.
We can't risk it being interrupted.
We need a place that's close to you and quiet.
Uh quiet?
- How are we doing, Will?
- Done.
Hold on.
According to this, there's air ducts and electrical conduits all running into there.
- So?
- So there's no "there" there.
Look.
- It's Adam.
- Are you sure?
Right behind 314.
- Can you unlock it?
- I don't have to.
All the locks in the lnitiative have been disengaged, except for the exits.
Demon open house.
Great.
So we know we're going to 314.
Now all we have to do is get there.
Willow, down!
Come on!
OK, it should be over here.
Once I'm in, barricade the door behind me.
- Is this place OK to be Magic Central?
- It should do.
- As long as we don't get blowed up.
- What are the odds ofthat?
- How long before the ritual kicks in?
- Five minutes, give or take.
- I'll move fast, then.
- Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone.
I won't be.
Riley.
Are you hurt?
Say something.
What is this?
- Why won't you talk to me?
- He can't.
He's not programmed to.
He's part ofthe final phase now.
As youwere supposed to be.
Sorry.
I don'tjump through hoops on command.
I've never really been one to toe the line.
Oh.
Kill her.
I thought you'd never ask.
The power ofthe Slayer and all who wield it.
Last to ancient first, we invoke thee.
Grant us thy domain and primal strength.
Accept us and the powers we possess.
Make us, mind and heart and spirit, join.
Let the hand encompass us.
Do thy will.
Buffy!
Shut up.
Watch me kill your girlfriend, Finn.
That's an order.
Spiritus: spirit.
Animus: heart.
Sophus: mind.
And manus: the hand.
We enjoin that we may inhabit the vessel, the hand, daughter of Sineya, first ofthe Ones.
Is that it?
ls that all you got?
No.
She's got me.
Look who's come offthe bench.
I need to get to Adam - now.
Are you able?
Go.
Fall back!
Fall back!
Protect the flank!
Close down that pit!
Fun, isn't it?
I do appreciate violence.
Good.
- Broke your arm.
- Got another.
I've been upgrading.
We implore thee, admit us.
Bring us to the vessel.
Take us now.
- You can't last much longer.
- We can.
We are for ever.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
What are you making me do this for?
Not that I'm not enjoying myself.
But Adam's not gonna like it if l How can you You can never hope to grasp the source of our power.
But yours is right here.
Buffy.
Wow.
That was Nasty sort offellow.
- Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?
- Yes.
Thank you.
But your heroism is slightly muted by your helping Adam start a war that would kill us.
You probablyjust saved us so we wouldn't stake you right here.
Well, yeah.
Did it work?
Then everything's all right.
We all get to be not staked through the heart.
Good work!
- Buffy!
- Wasn't it amazing?
- You were great.
- We were great.
- We still got men out there.
- Well, let's go save 'em, by gum.
You guys open the exits.
You, organise the soldiers, pull 'em back.
I'll take point.
- Are you up to this?
- I am.
It was an experiment.
The lnitiative represented the government's interests in not only controlling the otherworldly menace, but in harnessing its power for our own military purposes.
The considered opinion ofthis council is that the experiment has failed.
Once the prototype took control ofthe complex, oursoldiers suffered a 40 per cent casualtyrate.
It was only through the actions ofa deserter anda group ofcivilian insurrectionists that ourlosses were not total.
I trust the irony ofthat is notlost on any ofus.
Maggie Walsh's vision was brilliant, but ultimately insupportable.
The demons cannotbe harnessed.
Cannotbe controlled.
We therefore recommend that this project be terminated and all records concerning it expunged.
Our soldiers'll be debriefed.
Standard confidentiality clause.
We will monitor the civilians and the usual measures prepared, should they try to go public.
I don't think they will.
The lnitiative itself will be filled in with concrete.
Burn it down, gentlemen.
Burn it down and salt the earth.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
The lnitiative created this and they can't stop it.
But we will.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": The power ofthe Slayer and all who wield it.
Last to ancient first, we invoke thee.
Make us mind and heart and spiritjoin.
- Spiritus: spirit.
- Animus: heart.
- Sophus: mind.
- And manus: the hand.
You could never hope to grasp the source of our power.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I can be there in the morning.
It's just a debriefing.
I won't disappear and they're not pinning anything on me.
Graham and the guys are testifying I'm the reason they're alive.
I might actually get an honourable discharge.
- In return for your silence, no doubt.
- Oh, yeah.
Having the scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is an advantage.
It's like you're blackmailing the government.
In a patriotic way.
I'll call you when it's over.
Dinner is served.
And my very own recipe.
You pushed the button on the microwave that says popcorn?
Actually, I pushed defrost, but Joyce was there in the clinch.
Well, you guys have fun tonight.
- It was very nice meeting you.
- It was nice meeting you finally.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Did you notice how pointedly I said finally?
- No.
Let the vidfest begin.
- You sure you won'tjoin us?
- No, you guys have your fun.
I'm tired.
I can't believe you're not exhausted.
Have you slept since?
- Still feel a little bit too wired.
- Yeah, that spell was powerful.
- Don't think I could sleep.
- Well, we got plenty of vid.
And I'm putting in a pre-emptive bid for Apocalypse Now?
Did you get anything less Heart-of-Darknessy?
It's a gay romp!
It's the feel-good movie ofwhatever year it was.
- What else?
- Don't worry.
Got plenty of chick and British-guy flicks.
These puppies should last us all night.
I think it's strange.
I mean, I think I should worry that we haven't found her a name.
Who?
Miss Kitty?
You'd think she'd let us know her name by now.
She will.
She's not all grown yet.
You're not worried?
I never worry here.
I'm safe here.
You don't know everything about me.
Have you told me your real name?
You know that.
They will find out, you know.
About you.
I don't have time to think about that.
You know I have all this homework to finish.
- Are you gonna finish in time for class?
- I can be late.
But you've never taken drama before.
You might miss something important.
I don't wanna leave here.
Why not?
It's so bright.
And there's something out there.
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.
Heard you're taking drama.
- It's a tough course.
- You took it?
- I've been here for ever.
- So what you been doing?
- Doing spells?
She does spells with Tara.
- Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm gonna be late.
Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell, and then I do a spell by myself.
Isn't this exciting?
Our first production!
I can't wait till our scene!
I love you!
- Don't step on my cues.
- Production?
Oh, my God!
The place is packed.
Everybody's here.
Your family's in the front row.
They look angry.
- There's a production?
- Somebody's got stage fright.
Isn't this the first class?
Well, you showed up late, or you'd have a better part.
I'm Cowboy Guy.
Your costume is perfect.
Nobody's gonna know the truth.
You know, about you.
- Costume?
- You're already in character.
I should've done that!
But how come I was given to understand that a drama class would have, you know, drama class.
- We haven't even rehearsed!
- Maybe some people haven't.
I showed up on time, so I got to be Cowboy Guy!
I just think it's really early to be putting on a play.
I don't even know what It isn't Madame Butterfly, is it?
I have a problem with opera.
All right, everyone!
Pay attention!
In just a few moments, that curtain is going to open on our very first production.
Everyone Willow's ever met is in that audience, including all of us.
That means we have to be perfect.
Stay in character, remember your lines, and energy, energy in the musical numbers!
- Did anyone see that?
- Acting is about hiding.
The audience wants to find you, strip you naked and eat you alive, so hide.
Stop that!
Now, costumes, sets, the things that you, you know You hold them, you touch them, use them.
- Props?
- No.
- Props?
- Yes!
It's all about subterfuge.
That's very annoying.
Now, go on out there, lie like dogs and have a wonderful time.
Ifwe stay in focus, keep our heads, and ifWillow doesn't step on cues, this'll be the best production of Death ofa Salesman we've done.
Stop it!
Good luck, everyone!
Break a leg!
I've made a little space for the cheese slices.
- Things aren't going very well.
- No!
This drama class is just They're not doing things in the proper way.
I'm in a play and my whole family's out there.
Why is there a cowboy in Death ofa Salesman anyway?
You don't understand yet, do you?
- Is there something following me?
- Yes.
Well, what should I do?
The play's gonna start soon and I don't even know my lines.
The play's already started.
That's not the point.
Why, hello, little lady.
Can I hold those milk pails for you?
Why, thank you.
But they're not very heavy.
Why have you come to our lonely small town, which has no post office and very few exports?
I've come looking for a man.
A salesman.
Everyone's starting to wonder about you.
The real you.
Ifthey find out, they'll punish you.
I can't help you with that.
What's after me?
ls it something I was supposed to do?
- Was I supposed to?
- Shh!
What was that?
What else could I expect from a bunch of low-rent, no-account hoodlums like you?
Hoodlums, yes!
You and your friends, your whole sex.
Throw 'em in the sea for all I care!
Throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles.
Men groping and spitting, all groin, no brain, three billion ofyou passing around the same worn-out urge.
Men!
With your sales!
Tara?
Tara, this really isn't Will!
- Buffy!
Oh, God.
- Come on.
Stay low.
- What did it look like?
- I don't know.
- I don't know what's after me.
- You must have done something.
No.
I never do anything.
I'm very seldom naughty.
I just came to class, and the play was starting.
The play is long over.
Why are you still in costume?
OK, still having to explain, wearing this is just my outfit.
Willow, everybody already knows.
Take it off.
No.
I need it.
For God's sake, just take it off!
That's better.
It's much more realistic.
See?
ls everybody very clear on this now?
Oh, my God, it's like a tragedy.
I tried to warn you.
It's exactly like a Greek tragedy.
There should only be Greeks.
My book report.
This summer I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.
Oh, who cares!
This book has many themes.
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
I'm awake.
I'm good.
- Did I miss anything?
- Nothing much at all really.
Bunch of massacring.
We gotta keep going, men.
We gotta take thathill.
Damn this war!
I have to say, I really feel that Apocalypse Now is overrated.
No, no.
It gets better.
- Men?
- I remember that it gets better.
Oh, my God.
What's happened to mymen?
- Want some corn?
- Butter flavour?
- New-car smell.
- Cool!
- What's her deal?
- Big faker.
I'm beginning to understand this now.
It's all about the journey, isn't it?
Thanks for making me have to pee.
- You don't need any help with that, right?
- I got a system.
Hey.
Hey, Joyce Mrs Summers.
We're not making too much noise down there?
Oh, no.
Anyway, they all left a while ago.
Oh, I should probably go catch up.
- Heard that before.
- I move pretty fast.
- You know, a man's always after - Conquest?
I'm a conquistador.
You sure it isn't comfort?
I'm a comfortador also.
I do know the difference.
I've learned about boys.
That's cool about you.
It's very late.
Would you like to rest for a while?
Yeah.
I'd like you.
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom first.
Don't get lost.
OK, I'm gonna find another bathroom.
I didn't order any vampires.
That's not the way out.
Hey, there you are.
Are you sure it's us you were looking for?
Giles here is gonna teach me to be a watcher.
Says I got the stuff.
- Spike's like a son to me.
- That's good.
I was into that for a while, but I got other stuff going on.
You gotta have something.
Gotta be with moving forward.
Like a shark.
Like a shark with feet and much less fins.
- And on land.
- Very good!
Buffy, are you sure you wanna play there?
- It's a pretty big sandbox.
- I'm OK.
It's not coming for me yet.
I just mean you can't protect yourself from some stuff.
- I'm way ahead ofyou, big brother.
- Brother?
Come on, put your back into it!
A watcher scoffs at gravity.
Do you know where you're going?
I've been thinking about getting back into vengeance.
- Is that right?
- Well, you know how I miss it.
I'm so at loose ends since I quit.
I think this is going to be a very big year for vengeance.
But isn't vengeance kind of vengeful?
- You don't want me to have a hobby.
- Not a vengeance hobby, no.
It's dangerous.
People can't do anything they want.
Society has rules and borders and an end zone.
It doesn't matter if Do you mind?
I'm talking to my demon.
- Sorry.
- We just think you're really interesting.
- Oh, I'm going places.
- I'm way ahead ofyou.
Is that right?
Watch this.
Do you wanna come in the back with us?
Oh, go on.
- I don't have to.
- I'll be fine.
I think I've figured out how to steer by gesturing emphatically.
Girls?
I know what's up there!
These will not protect you.
Giles!
- Xander, what are you doing here?
- What's after me?
It's because ofwhat we did, I know that.
What we did?
The others have gone on ahead.
Now, listen very carefully.
Your life may depend on what I'm about to tell you.
You need What?
Go where?
I don't understand.
Honey, I don't I can't hear you.
Wait!
Where are we going?
Where?
Hey!
Let go!
Hey!
Where are you from, Harris?
Well, the basement, mostly.
Were you born there?
Possibly.
I walked by your guidance counsellor's office one time.
A bunch ofyou were sitting there, waiting to be shepherded.
I remember it smelled like dead flowers.
Like decay.
Then it hit me.
The hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.
Where are you heading?
Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow.
And possibly Buffy's mom.
Your time is running out.
No, I'm just trying to get away.
There's something I can't fight.
Are you a soldier?
I'm a comfortador.
You're neither.
You're a whipping boy, raised by mongrels and set on a sacrificial stone.
I'm getting a cramp.
- Giles, it's here!
- This is more serious than we thought.
- I can fight anything, right?
- Maybe we should slap her.
Buffy?
That's not the way out.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You won't come upstairs?
What are you, ashamed of us?
- Your mother's crying her guts out!
- You don't understand.
No.
You don't understand.
The line ends here with us.
And you're not gonna change that.
You haven't got the heart.
You have to stop thinking.
Let it wash over you.
Don't you think it's old-fashioned?
This is the way women and men have behaved since the beginning.
Before time.
Now look into the light.
Step on up, step on up!
Try your luck!
Come on!
Come on!
- We'll miss the good stuff!
- Does she always want to train so badly?
- She's never heard the fable about patience.
- Which one is that?
The one with the fox and the less patient fox.
- Here.
I want to, I want to!
- Yes, go ahead.
I am a vampire!
Buffy, you have a sacred birthright to protect mankind.
Don't stick out your elbow.
I am a vampire!
You staked me!
- I haven't got any treats.
- For God's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl.
This is my business.
Blood ofthe lamb and all that.
Now you're gonna get that all over your face.
I know you.
I know you.
Hey!
Come on!
You're gonna miss everything!
Don't push me around.
I have a great deal to do.
I've hired myself out as an attraction.
Sideshow freak?
Well, at least it's showbiz.
- What do I do with all ofthis?
- You gotta make up your mind, Rupes.
What are you wasting time for?
Haven't you figured it all out yet with your enormous squishy frontal lobe?
I still think Buffy should have killed you.
I wear the cheese.
It does not wear me.
Honestly, you meet the most appalling sort of people.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
There's a great deal going on.
And all at once!
Don't we know it.
Only at death's door over here.
Look at Xander!
Got the sucking chest wound swinging.
I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night.
Now I'll be pushing up daisies, in the sense of being in the ground and fertilising the soil with decomposition.
OK.
A man walks into the office of a doctor.
He's wearing on his head - Wait, there's a duck.
Is that right?
- You suck!
Quiet!
You'll miss the humorous conclusion.
- She's doing quite well.
- Do you know this is your fault?
We have to think ofthe facts, Willow.
I'm very busy.
I have a gig myself, you know.
Something's after us.
It's like some primal, animal force.
- That used to be us.
- Don't get linear on me now, man.
And then the duck tells the doctor that there's a man that's attached to my ass.
See, it was the duck and not the man that spoke.
Rupert, you've gotta focus.
You must have some kind of explanation.
Ifwe don't know what we're fighting, I don't think we stand a chance.
It's strange It's not like anything we've faced before It seems familiar somehow Of course!
The spell we cast with Buffy Must have released Some primal evil that's come back seeking I'm not sure what Willow, look through the chronicles for some reference To a warrior beast I've got to warn Buffy There's every chance she might be next And Xander, help Willow And try not to bleed on my couch, I've just had it steam-cleaned No, wait Well, that was obvious.
I know who you are.
And I can defeat you with my intellect.
I can cripple you with my thoughts.
Of course, you underestimate me.
You couldn't know.
You never had a watcher.
Buffy, wake up!
Buffy, you have to wake up right away!
I'm not really in charge ofthese things.
Please wake up.
Oh, please!
I need my beauty sleep.
So stop it, OK?
Faith and I just made that bed.
For who?
I thought you were here to tell me.
The guys aren't here, are they?
We were gonna hang out and watch movies.
- You lost them.
- No.
No.
I think they need me to find them.
It's so late.
That clock's completely wrong.
Here.
- I'm never gonna use those.
- You think you know.
What's to come.
What you are.
You haven't even begun.
I think I need to go find the others.
Be back before dawn.
Have you seen my friends?
They wouldn'tjust disappear.
- Mom?
- Oh, hi, honey!
Why are you living in the walls?
Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here.
Don't worry about me.
- It looks dirty.
- Well, it seems that way to you.
I made some lemonade and I'm learning how to play mahjong.
- You go find your friends.
- I think they might be in danger.
I'm sorry, dear!
A mouse is playing with my knees.
I really don't think you should live in there.
Well, you could probably break through the wall.
- Hey, there, killer.
- Riley?
You're back?
I never left.
- How did the debriefing go?
- I told you not to worry about that.
It went great.
They made me surgeon general.
Why didn't you come and tell me?
We could have celebrated.
We're drawing up a plan for world domination.
The key element?
Coffee makers that think.
World domination?
ls that a good?
Baby, we're the government.
It's what we do.
She's uncomfortable with certain concepts.
It's understandable.
Aggression is a natural human tendency, though you and me come by it another way.
We're not demons.
Is that a fact?
Buffy, we've got important work here.
A lot offiling, giving things names.
What was yours?
Before Adam?
Not a man among us can remember.
The demons have escaped.
Run foryourlives.
- This could be trouble.
- We'd better make a fort.
I'll get some pillows.
Wait!
I have weapons!
I thought you were looking for your friends.
OK, killer.
Ifthat's the way you want it, I guess you're on your own.
I'm never gonna find them here.
Of course not.
That's the reason you came.
You're not in my dream.
I was borrowed.
- Someone has to speak for her.
- Let her speak for herself.
That's what's done in polite circles.
- Why do you follow me?
- I don't.
Where are my friends?
You're asking the wrong questions.
Make her speak.
I have no speech.
No name.
I live in the action of death.
The blood cry.
The penetrating wound.
I am destruction.
Absolute.
Alone.
The Slayer?
The first.
I am not alone.
The Slayer does not walk in this world.
I walk.
I talk.
I shop.
I sneeze.
I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back.
There's trees in the desert since you moved out.
And I don't sleep on a bed of bones.
Now give me back my friends.
No friends!
Just the kill.
We are alone!
That's it.
I'm waking up.
It's over.
We don't do this any more.
Enough!
